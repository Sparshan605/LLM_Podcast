["00:00", "trained my jockey podcast by night okay", "00:03", "so you were asking me before this about", "00:05", "the fight yeah yeah that's right yeah", "00:07", "and we'll you think because whether I", "00:09", "come to soccer that's what it they keep", "00:11", "the distance well and they know accepted", "00:14", "it this is what I think a lot of people", "00:16", "were like pissed off it was boring but I", "00:19", "think that's because they just want to", "00:20", "see people beat the fuck out of each", "00:22", "other which I understand that's why you", "00:23", "tune into cage fighting but to me the", "00:26", "way I always described martial arts is", "00:27", "its high level problem solving with dire", "00:31", "physical consequences and if you run in", "00:34", "on tyron woodley you got some dire", "00:36", "physical consequences he's a fucking", "00:38", "powerhouse and if Woodley charges at", "00:41", "Thompson just dire physical consequences", "00:44", "because he was getting tagged when he", "00:46", "would he need set it to me after the", "00:47", "fight he's like he caught me a few times", "00:48", "as I was charging towards them so", "00:51", "Woodley has a different style that", "00:54", "Thompson Thompson has that wide stance", "00:56", "that karate style and he's excellent and", "00:58", "moving in and moving out and almost like", "01:00", "point fighting you he's just jabbing you", "01:02", "hitting you with these clean left hands", "01:05", "sliding out of the way occasionally", "01:07", "throwing kicks but mostly what he's", "01:09", "doing is making you wonder what he's", "01:12", "going to do and when he's coming at you", "01:13", "and Woodley how to pick his battles and", "01:15", "figure out when he could launch himself", "01:16", "at him", "01:17", "so at any moment something could have", "01:20", "happened but a lot of shit didn't happen", "01:22", "so the people watching at home look", "01:24", "doesn't was born forward ever it's", "01:26", "because those moments are so critical", "01:29", "those moments are so dangerous", "01:31", "you can't just they would like it to be", "01:33", "like Frankie Edgar gray Manor just", "01:35", "fucking chaos and punches throwing wild", "01:37", "is not going to happen like that you", "01:40", "can't do that with wonder boy you can't", "01:41", "charge at him like that he will fucking", "01:43", "counter you and you look you will be one", "01:45", "of those people on his highlight reel so", "01:47", "tyron woodley was very smart and that he", "01:49", "knew he couldn't charge at him and", "01:51", "wonder boy he's not going to charge it", "01:54", "will either I mean he gotten almost", "01:55", "knocked the fuck out in the first fight", "01:57", "he almost got knocked the fuck out in", "01:59", "the fifth round the second guy to", "02:01", "Woody's a powerhouse man he hit so", "02:04", "goddamn hard so everybody had to be on", "02:06", "their toes they both had to be minding", "02:08", "their P's and Q's and that translated", "02:10", "for a boring fight to a lot of people", "02:12", "but not", "02:13", "to me to me I was like anything can", "02:15", "happen in any moment in the fifth round", "02:16", "it almost did was there when would when", "02:18", "Whitley connected and Thompson's knees", "02:20", "went out I mean he slumped he was out", "02:22", "man he was out for at least a half a", "02:24", "second or a moment you know there was a", "02:26", "moment where his legs gave out his body", "02:29", "went limp and they could have stopped", "02:31", "the fight right there I'm glad they", "02:33", "didn't I glad they kept going", "02:34", "I talked to Big John McCarthy in the", "02:37", "cage after the fight ago how close we to", "02:39", "stop without fighting goes because I", "02:41", "wasn't close to stopping my particle but", "02:42", "you were looking radios I was looking", "02:44", "because I go you were looking at close", "02:46", "because I'll never admit it I go but it", "02:48", "was I mean he was office outright he was", "02:50", "he was almost out he might have been out", "02:51", "for a half a second but he I gave him a", "02:53", "chance like he did a great job he did an", "02:55", "amazing job I mean that's why Big John", "02:57", "McCarthy is so important a guy with that", "02:59", "kind of experience and if he fucked that", "03:01", "up everybody would be so mad at them but", "03:03", "he did it perfect wasn't perfect he has", "03:06", "the most difficult job in the sport", "03:08", "other than the fighters fighters have", "03:10", "the most difficult job second most", "03:12", "difficult job is the referee third most", "03:14", "difficult job is the judges yeah I", "03:16", "really so I think so yeah believe he's", "03:18", "going to interpret it", "03:20", "trauma yeah or the other people well he", "03:22", "has to be he has to look he has to be at", "03:24", "the right angle like they're moving", "03:26", "around and they're fast and they could", "03:28", "go to his left and he could be over here", "03:29", "but something could be happening on", "03:31", "their right and he doesn't even see it", "03:32", "you know you don't know like sometimes", "03:34", "sometimes guys don't see taps sometimes", "03:37", "guys don't see certain eye pokes or", "03:39", "groin shots there's a lot of things that", "03:41", "can happen a referees job is insanely", "03:44", "difficult and they only get praised when", "03:46", "they fuck up or they only rather get", "03:48", "attention when they fuck up they don't", "03:50", "get any praise and they do a great job", "03:51", "and just just they need more you know", "03:54", "they need more more people need to", "03:57", "understand like how difficult that is so", "03:59", "that moment where tyrant finally did", "04:02", "connect on wonderboy and everybody's", "04:04", "like why didn't you do that earlier", "04:05", "because you could have got knocked the", "04:06", "fuck out like that was where the opening", "04:09", "was Woodley was so aggressive because he", "04:11", "was down on the scorecards at least in", "04:13", "his corners eyes and in my eyes he was", "04:15", "as well and he had a charge forward and", "04:17", "he had to connect and he did but to make", "04:20", "that happen a lot of things have to be", "04:23", "in place you have to understand", "04:24", "Wonderboys timing he had", "04:26", "fighting him for four rounds already he", "04:28", "was getting a sense of what wonder boy", "04:30", "could and couldn't do he also knew the", "04:31", "consequences he'd been tagged a couple", "04:33", "of times so he knew look I can't just", "04:35", "rush at him because wonder boy was", "04:37", "trying to time him with that right hook", "04:38", "he was standing in a southpaw position", "04:40", "with his right leg forward he throws", "04:42", "that front leg side kick to the body", "04:43", "throws it really well because he he", "04:46", "picks it up from the ground like low and", "04:48", "and it sort of scoops up so you don't", "04:51", "see it coming until it's too late it", "04:53", "might not be the most powerful", "04:54", "application of the front leg side kick", "04:56", "but it's very it's very sneaky because", "04:59", "he slides in with that foot low and then", "05:01", "it comes up and stabs you and you don't", "05:03", "know if it's going to come up as a side", "05:05", "kick or if it's going to go up and over", "05:06", "your shoulder as a round kick you don't", "05:08", "know what he's doing he's so sneaky", "05:10", "so Tyron had to be very cautious and for", "05:14", "a lot of people was very boring because", "05:15", "of that but I didn't think it was boring", "05:17", "while it's happening I was on the edge", "05:18", "of my seat I was like there are moments", "05:20", "there's going to be moments when the", "05:22", "shit starts flying and in those moments", "05:24", "that's where the fight becomes amazing", "05:26", "but those guys are smart it is not dumb", "05:29", "and the belt is so goddamn important", "05:31", "when you have the belt you get to decide", "05:33", "you fight all the best fighters you you", "05:36", "you you make the money you know you get", "05:38", "the opportunities for the big money", "05:39", "fight it's like the Conor McGregor type", "05:41", "fights there was only happen if you have", "05:42", "the belt if you don't the belt nobody", "05:44", "gives a fuck about you so for a guy like", "05:46", "the tyrant man that belt is everything", "05:48", "for a guy like Woodley or a guy like a", "05:51", "Wonder Boy rather that belt is", "05:52", "everything you don't have that belt you", "05:54", "make a fraction of what you make like", "05:56", "think about that fight that fights", "05:57", "insanely close it was so close", "05:59", "Dominick Cruz afterwards said that's", "06:01", "basically the same fight as the first", "06:03", "fight", "06:03", "it's like you could call if you call the", "06:05", "first fight a draw you could easily call", "06:07", "this fight a draw and I agree with him", "06:08", "and so that means that wonderboy and", "06:11", "Woodley are essentially like so closely", "06:13", "matched stylistically that it's a wash", "06:16", "right but meanwhile woodleigh's the one", "06:18", "who's the champion Woodley's the one who", "06:20", "has the potential to fight Conor", "06:21", "McGregor Woodley is the one who has a", "06:23", "potential to fight Michael Bisping well", "06:25", "who else he fights at whatever weight he", "06:26", "fights at and that is where the money is", "06:29", "so he's the guy was going to get the", "06:30", "money", "06:31", "whereas Wonder Boys you essentially had", "06:33", "a draw with him proved that he was at", "06:35", "least close enough on one fight and just", "06:39", "hair under the second fight team ah he's", "06:42", "going to make a fraction of what Woodley", "06:44", "makes likely so that those consequences", "06:48", "have to be taken into consideration when", "06:50", "you're watching these guys fight is that", "06:51", "they know there's a wind bonus and", "06:53", "there's a loss like if you if you lose", "06:56", "you get your show money you don't get a", "06:58", "bonus if you win you get twice the money", "07:00", "like a lot of guys have that way their", "07:02", "contract is structured you'll they'll", "07:04", "make X if they win and they'll make X", "07:06", "plus X if they'll make X plus X if they", "07:09", "win but if they lose they only make X so", "07:11", "they might have they might be getting", "07:13", "$200,000 for the fight but another", "07:15", "$200,000 if they win that's a giant", "07:17", "swing that's a big deal so they have to", "07:19", "be really fucking careful they don't", "07:20", "make mistakes", "07:21", "I don't like win bonuses man I don't", "07:24", "like it I think those guys are trying to", "07:27", "win anyway", "07:27", "they're trying to win I just I just", "07:28", "think like especially in particular in", "07:30", "situations like that when fights are", "07:32", "like that fucking close like a judge can", "07:34", "decide whether or not you make an extra", "07:36", "200 grand or don't like that seems crazy",
