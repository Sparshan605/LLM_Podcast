professors coming", "13:40", "through the philosophy programs both in", "13:42", "New Zealand and the United States", "13:44", "Columbia University had a fantastic ph.d", "13:47", "program so I was

"68:58", "yeah I had this problem and things", "69:01", "didn't really become critical", "69:02", "until my mid to early 40s when as a", "69:08", "result of walking my whole life with a", "69:09",

couldn't get any kind of operations", "69:22", "because George st.

best I could", "69:57", "with my hip problems and of course the", "70:00", "original leg problem and then at some", "70:04", "point I got to a point where I literally", "70:07", "if I walk down in New

just became impossible", "70:18", "to work with and I ended up getting a", "70:20", "full hip replacement and so that's when", "70:23", "they shear off the top of your head yeah", "70:25", "they screw a bolt down in there with a", "70:27", "new hip and that's correct and how does", "70:29", "it feel now um it's pain free which is a", "70:31", "wonderful thing for me like any fake hip", "70:36", "it's never gonna be as strong as your", "70:37", "real help this limitations on what I can", "70:38", "do there the only problem was that", "70:40", "shortly after the hip replacement went", "70:43", "and then my knee finally collapsed after", "70:45", "30 years of problems and so I'm gonna", "70:47", "have to get a knee replacement on the", "70:49", "same leg", "70:50", "so yeah who and how do they do that one", "70:53", "knee replacements a little bit tricky", "70:55", "because you don't have as much bone mass", "70:56", "to work with and general generally the", "70:59", "longevity of knee replacements as not as", "71:02", "because there's much more movement in", "71:04", "the need and there there wasn't a hip", "71:06", "there's much greater range of motion and", "71:09", "this less bone to a fixed who they", "71:11", "generally don't have the longevity of a", "71:14", "hip replacement", "71:16", "so I'm 50 years old so ideally you would", "71:21", "want a replacement that

have to do it who", "71:33", "knows what kind of crazy technology", "71:35", "they'll have down the line I hope so I", "71:37", "hope they give me some kind of superhero", "71:39", "leg that turns things around for me yeah", "71:41", "well you never know I mean it's just the", "71:44", "the nature of the hip replacement is so", "71:46", "it's so brutally invasive the sheering", "71:51", "off the top of the hip and then the rod", "71:53", "that's inserted deep into the bone of", "71:56", "the hip and then all that jazz you know", "71:59", "it's a lot it's a lot going on there so", "72:02", "to answer your question in the early", "72:05", "days it was it was an impediment that I", "72:07", "worked around but as I got older I had", "72:11", "to do a first operation and now second", "72:15", "but believe it or not Joe I was actually", "72:17", "scheduled to get my new replacement", "72:18", "tomorrow but I didn't do it because Gary", "72:23", "tonin is gonna be fighting his first MMA", "72:25", "fight and March 26 now is he fighting", "72:27", "for 1 FC 1 FC so I if I got the knee", "72:31", "replacement now I would not be able to", "72:33", "help him get ready first first him MA", "72:35", "fine which I thought would be there's", "72:38", "not fear on my part of it right and so I", "72:40", "delayed it until after that fine why did", "72:43", "he decide on one FC that's an", "72:45", "interesting question you'd have to ask", "72:46", "every tone - to be certain", "72:49", "but he I think one of his main fears was", "72:54", "that if he went through the amateur", "72:55", "route and then worked his way towards", "72:57", "the UFC there would be problems because", "73:00", "he's already an established name in", "73:01", "grappling and I think he was concerned", "73:04", "it would be difficult for him to get", "73:05", "people to fight amateur and and then", "73:10", "eventually make his way to the UFC", "73:12", "whereas one if see as a fairly", "73:14", "well-known organization and they were", "73:16", "pretty open that they he did a grappling", "73:18", "match for them and they loved it they", "73:20", "were like you know are you interested in", "73:21", "MMA and so he could as it were go into a", "73:28", "fairly high level of MMA right from the", "73:30", "start as opposed to do a long circuitous", "73:32", "amateur route and in battle his way into", "73:34", "the UFC I believe don't quote me on this", "73:37", "but I believe that was the logic behind", "73:38", "it hmm now are you able so when you're", "73:43", "demonstrating techniques are you", "73:44", "demonstrating them verbally or you after", "73:47", "the hip replacement I could only do it", "73:49", "verbally and I had to trust and my my", "73:53", "students Eddie Cummings Garrett Aaron", "73:55", "Gordon Ryan and others Brian glekas and", "73:57", "no no somebody's one of my great", "73:59", "students I would point with a stick and", "74:04", "they would do the moves for me since", "74:07", "then I've gotten a little better and I", "74:09", "like to demonstrate a space that I can", "74:11", "this days when I I can barely walk and", "74:14", "on those days I'll have the students go", "74:16", "through sometimes they certain standing", "74:18", "techniques that I a little risky for me", "74:20", "to do you know I have students", "74:21", "demonstrate those but I I do what I can", "74:27", "on the days then did I teach it is quite", "74:29", "fascinating that a guy who has", "74:31", "catastrophic injuries of his leg is one", "74:35",

him", "122:07", "they just looked like they didn't belong", "122:09", "in there what you typically find is that", "122:12", "when you come to a CS who's the greatest", "122:14", "of all time it's always going to come", "122:16", "down to criteria and each guy has his", "122:21", "strong point his claim to fame as far as", "122:24", "you know I was the base guy of all time", "122:26", "let's stick with just UFC champions guys", "122:29", "always we could discussion would be too", "122:31", "great if we go into pride and you know", "122:33", "right sure yeah this guy's gonna get out",
