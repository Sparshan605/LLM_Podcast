second", "08:30", "edition very nice work then Don Lattin", "08:34", "who's not that well-known but he's", "08:37", "written several books about the history", "08:39", "of psychedelics and the people involved", "08:41", "and he wrote a book that they published", "08:44", "called changing our minds ironically", "08:47", "about the same time Michael Pollan", "08:49", "brought his book out so",

a real lesson to", "09:38", "everybody but anyway so because they", "09:43", "still existed and really because of the", "09:46", "of the resurrection of the ayahuasca", "09:49", "reader that had been

there", "11:20", "is probably fiction those two books gave", "11:24", "me complementary perspective the", "11:28", "teachings of Don Juan was the", "11:30", "ethnographic lands through which you",

and so", "11:55", "when the book fell into my hands at age", "11:57", "17 I was very excited and I read the", "12:00", "whole thing and and this is what really", "12:03", "helped me focus my career it

but there were there were", "13:56", "iconic people like Scholl T's Andrew", "13:59", "wild Shogun another interesting fellow", "14:03", "many interesting people one of the most", "14:06", "interesting in the first conference was", "14:09", "a gentleman named Steven Zara a", "14:12", "Hungarian chemist and psychiatrist and", "14:16", "pharmacologist and he originally worked", "14:22", "in Budapest and and eventually he moved", "14:26", "to the States and became pretty high up", "14:28", "in the National Institutes of Health he", "14:31", "was the director of the National", "14:33", "Institute on Drug Abuse in the late 50s", "14:36", "but the interesting thing is before that", "14:40", "he was just a researcher and at a", "14:43", "hospital in in Budapest he applied to", "14:46", "Sandoz to get LSD he wanted to do", "14:49", "research with LSD they refused to give", "14:52", "it to him because he was behind the Iron", "14:55", "Curtain so he so he synthesized DMT", "14:59", "being a chemist and he had to determine", "15:03", "if it was actually a psychedelic so in", "15:05", "the grand tradition he did that by self", "15:08", "injecting himself you know so he's a", "15:12", "true pioneer and I invited him to the", "15:15", "conference so he's the first person to", "15:17", "definitively show that DMT was a", "15:19", "psychedelic he's now 95 he's in great", "15:24", "shape I invited him to the conference", "15:26", "but he said well I'm 95 I don't go", "15:29", "anywhere anymore", "15:31", "but he submitted a very nice of video", "15:34", "introduction to it and the other", "15:36", "interesting thing that he did after the", "15:39", "67 conference he he he was thinking", "15:42", "what's going on and what is it with the", "15:44", "hippies of all the psychedelics and and", "15:47", "so his supervisor said well Steve why", "15:51", "don't you go over to Haight Ashbury and", "15:52", "hang out for a while so he did and he", "15:55", "submitted a paper called the scientist", "15:58", "among the hippies and they wouldn't let", "16:01", "him publish they said you can't publish", "16:04", "this so it's sat in his drawer for 50", "16:07", "years when this book came along he said", "16:10", "I have something I'll submit here I", "16:11", "don't care if they you know it's it", "16:14", "doesn't matter anymore so one of the", "16:16", "papers in this second volume is his", "16:20", "original 67 paper oh and then so the", "16:24", "second volume is kind of you know", "16:26", "because the government didn't step up to", "16:29", "the plate like they said they would", "16:31", "there was no follow-up conferences and", "16:34", "and I for a long time I wanted to do a", "16:37", "follow-up conference I wanted to do it", "16:39", "on the 30th anniversary 97 never", "16:42", "happened time passes so 2017 was the", "16:46", "50th anniversary it all fell together oh", "16:49", "wow you know I found a venue in the UK a", "16:54", "beautiful country house that was called", "16:57", "tearing hem hall that was run by one of", "17:00", "our friends who shares you know our", "17:03", "perspective he made that available we", "17:06", "put the word out we got support to", "17:08", "produce the conference so we brought", "17:11", "about 16 people you know - tearing ham", "17:16", "and England spent three days presenting", "17:18", "and those videos are all up on the web", "17:22", "I'll send you the link that's open", "17:24", "access the other thing that we couldn't", "17:26", "do in 67 that we did in you know 2017", "17:30", "there was no Facebook live-streaming", "17:32", "well all our videos were Facebook live", "17:35", "streams we have 60,000 people watching", "17:38", "these lectures at some points you know I", "17:41", "mean so that's amazing that's", "17:44", "and that created excitement and then we", "17:47", "basically paid for the book by", "17:49", "pre-selling reselling it and a lot of", "17:54", "people stepped up and ordered a lot of", "17:57", "people were very patient because I was", "17:59", "you know I was I thought oh this will be", "18:01", "out by Christmas right well no it's a", "18:04", "big project so it took six months longer", "18:07", "than I thought", "18:09", "but now it's out there and hopefully", "18:12", "it'll be a a landmark in the field like", "18:17", "the first one was and and what we wanted", "18:19", "to do to honor the first one was reprint", "18:21", "the first one Aloha the second one so", "18:24", "that's why it's two books we did a high", "18:27", "resolution scam of the original book and", "18:31", "reprinted that one doesn't make you", "18:35", "think like imagine if Nixon wasn't", "18:36", "president back then what could have been", "18:38", "done like what if they didn't have that", "18:40", "sweeping 1970 psychedelic act where they", "18:46", "made everything illegal like what if", "18:48", "they continued with this stuff I could", "18:49", "who knows where we would be today we", "18:51", "yeah we could ask that question about a", "18:52", "lot of things what if that didn't happen", "18:54", "like the the psychedelic research that's", "18:57", "happening now that's it's taken 40 years", "19:01", "TN back to it and basically the", "19:05", "psychedelic research is is a lot of the", "19:08", "same thing was going back going on back", "19:11", "in the even late 50s and 60s what's", "19:14", "going on now is they're repeating a lot", "19:16", "of that mm-hmm", "19:17", "but with more rigorous experimental", "19:19", "design with with better controls and all", "19:22", "that but it's the same stuff you know", "19:24", "which is wonderful I mean I'm I'm all", "19:27", "for it to see this work done I also have", "19:31", "you know plenty to say about the", "19:33", "limitations of that strictly clinical", "19:36", "you know sort of medical approach I mean", "19:41", "I think you know organizations like maps", "19:45", "and hefter have to work within the", "19:49", "constraints of what's possible but I", "19:52", "think in some ways they you know they", "19:55", "force themselves to they're forced to", "19:57", "put on", "19:57", "blinders in a certain way - what else is", "20:01", "possible you know for example the way", "20:03", "that ayahuasca has been sort of", "20:07", "marginalized and there is research going", "20:10", "on about it but there's nothing to prove", "20:12", "in the States and I think it's important", "20:17", "to pursue that work but because you", "20:19", "can't synthesize ayahuasca like you can", "20:21", "psilocybin or MDMA or these things that", "20:25", "are there clinical trials it's much more", "20:27", "difficult to study within the", "20:29", "constraints of a phase one you know", "20:32", "clinical trial but in fact ayahuasca is", "20:35", "touching I think far more lives than say", "20:39", "well I can't say about mushrooms because", "20:42", "mushrooms are a lot out there but you", "20:45", "know the potential the impact that it's", "20:48", "having on society is much greater", "20:50", "because people are rediscovering this", "20:54", "and people are I think reaching out for", "20:58", "they're reaching out for anything that", "21:01", "that will work you know as a society we", "21:03", "are spiritually bereft and I think", "21:06", "there's a pervasive sense of despair and", "21:10", "a feeling of what would you call it", "21:13", "spiritual impoverishment or something", "21:16", "then we see that all of our institutions", "21:19", "are becoming you know

out to be not very", "54:52", "exciting but we it took us to larger era", "54:54", "that's why we went to latter era was in", "54:57", "quest of this thing which we called the", "54:59", "secret when we got to lot sure era what", "55:02", "was really there were mushrooms", "55:03", "everywhere in the pasture that quickly", "55:07", "reorganized our priorities right and and", "55:11", "it was though we were in the presence of", "55:13", "this intelligence and it presented", "55:15", "itself very much we called it the", "55:17", "teacher and it was downloading all of", "55:20", "this information to us and that was", "55:24", "another characteristic of alien", "55:27", "encounters generic alien encounters", "55:29", "usually involved the transfer of special", "55:31", "information people are shown a book or", "55:34", "they're shown you know something that is", "55:38", "transmitted from the teacher to the", "55:41", "recipient and we we got that in spades", "55:43", "we got this encounter and it had those", "55:48", "characteristics and then another", "55:51", "characteristic is there there is so", "55:53", "information is given and gifts are given", "55:56", "you know and the information that was", "56:00", "transmitted resulted in a couple of", "56:04", "things well the primary thing that that", "56:07", "came out of that was Terrance's idea", "56:08", "about the time about time wave and the", "56:11", "eaching the genesis of that idea came", "56:14", "out of the experiment at lecture era and", "56:16", "then over decades became refined and", "56:20", "developed now whether there's any", "56:22", "validity to it I'm not sure and I've", "56:25", "always been very skeptical about it and", "56:28", "you know it failed its major test which", "56:31", "is yeah the space-time continuum did not", "56:35", "collapse on December 21st 2012 as was", "56:38", "predicted but there are interesting", "56:40", "things about that about the time wave if", "56:43", "it's just an interesting thing", "56:45", "considered", "56:49", "you know in its own context as a strange", "56:53", "mathematical construction that in many", "56:57", "ways as a reflection of Terrence's", "56:59", "psyche he was the only one that could", "57:01", "really understand it and interpret it", "57:04", "there's a bunch of people listen you", "57:05", "probably don't know what we're talking", "57:06", "about we're talking about time wave zero", "57:07", "time wave zero right and we wrote the", "57:10", "invisible landscape in our first book", "57:13", "it's four people have no idea what we're", "57:14", "talking about explain what time wave", "57:15", "zero okay well essentially that he", "57:18", "essentially it was an algorithm yeah", "57:20", "based on the structure of the eaching", "57:23", "this Oracle of 64 hexagrams and he", "57:28", "treated it in such a way that he claimed", "57:31", "it it described that time had a", "57:34", "structure and that this thing was that", "57:38", "this this time wave described the", "57:40", "structure of time essentially and thus", "57:43", "was a predictive tool among other things", "57:46", "and that it you know was a way to look", "57:51", "at the ingress of novelty into the", "57:56", "continuum the idea that there really are", "57:58", "new things under the Sun new things", "58:01", "happen that have never

think which", "58:14", "is a better term and Terence and I used", "58:16", "to have you know I wouldn't call them", "58:19", "arguments I call them heated discussions", "58:22", "or enthusiastic discussions about how", "58:25", "this happened I do not disagree with the", "58:27", "principle that that there is novelty I'm", "58:30", "not sure the time wave really describes", "58:32", "it adequately but it was it was an", "58:34", "attempt to and and whatever it was it", "58:39", "was something that was a gift from this", "58:43", "teacher at least the the Nugget of the", "58:46", "the idea that right the other thing that", "58:49", "came back the other gift that came back", "58:52", "from watcher era was nothing", "58:55", "supernatural or anything like that the", "58:59", "gift was the spores of the mushroom", "59:01", "we took the spores of the mushroom and", "59:04", "we took them back with us and then over", "59:06", "two or three years we figured out how to", "59:08", "grow them and we shared that with the", "59:11", "rest of the world and that was really", "59:14", "the thing that and look at the impact", "59:16", "that that's had on society you know and", "59:19", "Terrance was fond of saying Terrance did", "59:21", "say you know we are in a symbiotic", "59:24", "relationship with something that has", "59:27", "disguised itself as an alien invasion in", "59:31", "order not to alarm us right so and", "59:36", "that's what it was and before you know", "59:38", "it every nerdy tenth here a ten-year-old", "59:42", "in basements across the the country you", "59:45", "know we're growing mushrooms and able to", "59:47", "do it because the sim the technique was", "59:50", "very simple so it's all about what's", "59:52", "Johnny doing down in the basement honey", "59:54", "oh I don't know some science project", "59:56", "something about growing mushrooms you", "59:59", "know so effectively the alien invasion", "60:02", "was a complete

"certainly look yeah they look like our", "62:03", "idea of an alien yeah really we probably", "62:06", "look like aliens to octopus so yeah but", "62:10", "you know another and another interesting", "62:14", "maybe interesting angle on this was I", "62:20", "yeah I think it was 2015 I was invited", "62:23", "to another private conference actually a", "62:25", "tearing ham and the subject of the", "62:28", "conference was DMT entities and you know", "62:33", "arm the entities you see on DMT are they", "62:36", "real or not tall order very difficult to", "62:41", "really unpack that for one thing what do", "62:45", "you mean by real let's start there", "62:47", "anything experiences real right you know", "62:50", "so start there but the talk that I", "62:55", "presented was called is DMT

conclude", "63:10", "that probably not you know because if", "63:14", "you're going to postulate that what you", "63:16", "really have to talk about is the origin", "63:20", "of tryptophan because

you said where you have to go", "94:57", "back and and unpacked all of these", "95:00", "things and when we got excited about DMT", "95:04", "Terence and me in the early in the late", "95:06", "60s

something that is", "95:55", "entirely within the brain that it", "95:57", "originates or is it something that is it", "96:00", "like a lens that you know or our eyes", "96:04", "are covered with with

know a lot of a lot of", "97:18", "people who have worked in this area say", "97:21", "it's it's pretty well established that", "97:22", "endogenous DMT can produce these states", "97:25", "that the

it's it's not so clear that that", "97:43", "goes on I mean it's clear that it can be", "97:45", "produced but David Nicholls you know who", "97:48", "knows a thing or two about pharmacology", "97:51", "founder of the Hefner Institute", "97:53", "world's you know most authoritative the", "97:59", "highest authority when it comes to the", "98:01", "chemistry and pharmacology of", "98:03",
