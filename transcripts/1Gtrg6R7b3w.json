you know it's", "11:36", "about giving about minus 80 outside", "11:38", "which took it's hard to wrap your mind", "11:40", "around that but I've tried to put it in", "11:41", "perspective by saying I could take a cup", "11:43", "of boiling water and throw it in an air", "11:45", "and immediately turns ice like that's", "11:46", "that's that's the temperature we're", "11:48", "dealing with yeah

"12:46", "would keep it warm and the second I", "12:48", "wanted to take it out I pull it out real", "12:49", "quick hit play and then it would you", "12:51", "know usually it lasts a minute or third", "12:53", "enough to get a little clip or something", "12:54", "like that you couldn't just let it run", "12:55", "but then it would you know completely", "12:57", "freeze even a full battery would be you", "12:58", "know on zero battery by pretty quickly", "13:00", "you using solar panels to charge it yeah", "13:03", "so one crazy cool thing about Antarctica", "13:05", "at that time of year is it's 24 hours of", "13:07", "daylight and so the Sun never sets so", "13:09", "even when I'm on my tent in the middle", "13:10", "of the night I mask your plugs to kind", "13:12", "of pretend like it's nighttime but 24", "13:14", "hours of daylight so solar panels", "13:16", "keeping everything charged cameras phone", "13:18", "batteries all that and are you traveling", "13:21", "with are you using GPS yeah so I had", "13:25", "some waypoints the GPS waypoints that", "13:27", "kind of", "13:27", "led my path to the South Pole etc but", "13:29", "mostly actually using a compass so I'd", "13:31", "look at my GPS maybe once every week or", "13:33", "something like that just cuz I'm bearing", "13:35", "the juice is actually just easier", "13:38", "because so I basically had like a",

"13:47", "actually more than half of the time the", "13:49", "clouds would come in so be just complete", "13:50", "and utter whiteout I couldn't even see", "13:52", "one step in front of me and so I'd", "13:54", "actually have to just stare down at my", "13:56", "compass keep it on this bearing and so", "13:58", "imagine you can't see anything can't see", "14:00", "one step in front of you I'm pulling it", "14:01", "you know 300 pound sled 1213 hours per", "14:04", "day not listening to anything really can", "14:07", "they dead silence and just staring at", "14:09", "this compass bearing all day long so", "14:13", "going crazy I mean the mental side of it", "14:18", "was by far the most interesting side of", "14:20", "it for me you know have a lifelong", "14:22", "endurance athlete

hours everyday", "16:02", "between getting up boiling my water", "16:04", "getting out of my tent in those crazy", "16:06", "conditions packing my sled dragging it", "16:08", "for 13 hours setting my tent back up in", "16:09", "these storms but I got into the sort of", "16:11", "sequence of being so present with each", "16:13", "step each next sequence that it ended up", "16:16", "being in this really timeless spaceless", "16:18", "place in my mind of true high", "16:19", "performance that was almost like the", "16:22", "most deepest peaceful meditative state", "16:24", "that I can possibly imagine it was it", "16:26", "was very profound and beautiful to get", "16:28", "there in my mind no are you boiling this", "16:32", "water in your tent like yeah so it kind", "16:36", "of a slightly different white gas fuel", "16:38", "stove so not the canisters where you", "16:40", "could throw away but that gas that you", "16:41", "could refill the stove but a stove with", "16:43", "fuel basically the way my tent was you", "16:45", "saw the outer layer of the tent there", "16:47", "there's actually an inner part that's a", "16:48", "tent so that there's a vestibule where", "16:50", "basically there's snow inside the", "16:52", "doorway but not outside outside so I", "16:54", "would shovel that snow from inside of", "16:56", "the tent vestibule into my pot and be", "16:59", "able to melt the water that way and", "17:01", "drink about six liters of water every", "17:02", "single day when I was out there no it's", "17:07", "a lot of snow a lot of n takes a few", "17:08", "hours to melt that but people don't", "17:10", "realize this in Arctic is actually the", "17:11", "largest desert in the world so it's", "17:14", "actually very dry it doesn't snow very", "17:16", "often but when it does of course never", "17:17", "melt and the South Pole was at 9,000 300", "17:20", "feet so not only am I in this desert but", "17:22", "I'm at altitude doing this thing did you", "17:29", "train it altitude use like one of those", "17:31", "tents to sleep in or yeah so this this", "17:35", "gym that Mike and I trained at it's", "17:36", "called evolution health care and fitness", "17:37", "in Portland they actually have an", "17:39", "altitude room there so that it's not", "17:41", "even a tent but they actually have a", "17:42", "full a full room where you can you know", "17:45", "got rowing machines it's got treadmills", "17:47", "it's got all that simulated up to about", "17:48", "14,000 how big is the room it's about", "17:51", "400 square feet I still is big I mean", "17:54", "it's not like", "17:54", "you know yeah it's like a proper room", "17:56", "I've been in some of those tents before", "17:58", "when I was racing triathlon many years", "17:59", "ago a lot people were starting to sleep", "18:00", "in those tents but a lot people have a", "18:02", "hard time and then they get warm and", "18:04", "stuff like that and a lot fighters use", "18:05", "them as well but but yeah it was pretty", "18:08", "cool to have a full room that you can", "18:09", "actually you know be in and move in", "18:11", "probably for to stimulate some of the", "18:13", "high intensity stuff yeah and so it", "18:15", "would take you hours every day to make", "18:17", "your water yeah I would say I was", "18:19", "boiling water for about 3-4 hours per", "18:21", "day so an hour two in the morning hour", "18:22", "two in the evening it takes a lot of", "18:24", "energy to boil you know frozen snow when", "18:27", "it's that cold out she had to care I had", "18:29", "to carry a lot of fuel that was the", "18:30", "others really happy I was gonna say", "18:32", "that's like hundreds of hours of fuel", "18:34", "yeah so I took about 17 liters of fuel", "18:39", "so that's what six gallons or something", "18:40", "like that how did you know that that was", "18:43", "gonna be enough I did some practicing", "18:45", "beforehand I in 2016 I did another world", "18:50", "record project where I climbed the", "18:52", "tallest mountain on each of the seven", "18:53", "continents the Seven Summits as well as", "18:55", "went to the North and

during that time", "19:04", "Denali etc all of that in 139 days but I", "19:08", "did that and that kind of helped me get", "19:10", "a sense of it but honestly it was also", "19:12", "best guess based on talking to people", "19:14", "different experts in the field you know", "19:16", "diving into that but you never know is", "19:18", "it gonna be enough or too little I", "19:19", "decided too much when you when when you", "19:22", "finally got to the end how much do you", "19:23", "have left", "19:24", "so my final push I actually I woke up on", "19:26", "the morning of Christmas Eve 24th of", "19:30", "December this past year and it look I", "19:31", "was 77 miles from the finish and I've", "19:34", "been going at that point at the", "19:35", "beginning of the trip I was only going", "19:37", "910 miles per day towards the end I", "19:39", "started going about 20-25 miles per day", "19:41", "so I said you know what like I'm about", "19:42", "three days out and then I thought to", "19:44", "myself maybe if I could push really hard", "19:46", "these next two days I could do it in two", "19:48", "days like 215 plus hour days like really", "19:50", "get into it and start looking at my fuel", "19:54", "and food supplies and like they were", "19:55", "pretty low I had enough fuel a few a few", "19:57", "liters of fuel but I actually only had", "19:59", "about a day or two a food like real", "20:00", "substantial food left and so I woke up", "20:04", "and I was like alright let's go for this", "20:06", "and in the actually deepest", "20:08", "talk about flow states that was the", "20:10", "deepest flow state of my life I woke up", "20:11", "in one hour and that day it's Christmas", "20:13", "morning now I wake up and I'm just", "20:15", "locked in and I just came I didn't tell", "20:17", "anyone back home didn't tell my wife who", "20:19", "was tracking me they had this GPS", "20:20", "tracker where they could follow me but I", "20:22", "was just in my mind I was like you know", "20:23", "what not not three days not two days I'm", "20:25", "going straight for it and so I did a", "20:28", "final 32 hour continuous push on day 54", "20:32", "77 miles straight dragging my sled all", "20:35", "the way to get to the finish line and", "20:36", "one continuous push no music no nothing", "20:39", "just like in my head in this in this", "20:41", "crazy flow state of I don't know high", "20:44", "performance and it was it was it was a", "20:47", "crazy final push to get there but made", "20:49", "it right before the food and fuel ran", "20:50", "out oh my god there's no one there of", "20:55", "course right you crossed the finish side", "20:56", "you're like done this no one in the", "20:58", "world has ever done this applause nope I", "21:00", "was at zero and so what do you do when", "21:02", "you get to the end you said hey I'm done", "21:04", "come get me yeah yeah take for them to", "21:07", "come get you it took me a week to get", "21:09", "out of Antarctica totally took actually", "21:10", "me four days to get out of there", "21:13", "but there's a crazy other component to", "21:15", "this which is no one in the world had", "21:18", "ever done this before like I said a few", "21:19", "really talented people some of the best", "21:21", "explorers in the world had tried", "21:22", "recently one guy died and it just so", "21:25", "happened there's a really specific", "21:26", "season when you can attempt this but", "21:28", "another guy was attempting this at the", "21:30", "exact same time as me", "21:32", "a British a British guy who's a", "21:33", "equivalent of a Navy SEAL you know", "21:35", "British special forces the living most", "21:38", "experienced guy in Antarctica has", "21:40", "actually pulled 3,000 plus miles in", "21:42", "Antarctica now on various expeditions", "21:43", "and so we got dropped off one mile away", "21:46", "from each other to begin this thing and", "21:49", "obviously I was the first I did win this", "21:52", "race head-to-head and at the finish line", "21:53", "I waited for him for a few days because", "21:55", "I want to congratulate him because he", "21:56", "did ultimately finish but you can only", "21:58", "imagine I would go going back to that", "22:00", "first hour where I was like it's", "22:01", "impossible it was also like it's", "22:02", "impossible and both oh by the way this", "22:04", "Navy SEAL dude who knows more about", "22:06", "Antarctica than me he's often going I", "22:08", "can see him at the distance just like", "22:09", "leaving me in the dust but fortunately", "22:12", "after day six I caught up to him", "22:14", "you know I waved to him and this weird", "22:16", "like passing of the torch moment like I", "22:18", "was passing him and then I never saw him", "22:20", "again until I finished and I", "22:22", "about 70 miles ahead of him about two", "22:24", "and a half days ahead of him that's", "22:25", "gotta suck for him got this motherfucker", "22:29", "I brought it home for America man you", "22:32", "know appreciate that we all we all", "22:34", "appreciated that but still that's gotta", "22:36", "suck for him yeah so I actually even", "22:38", "though I finished and the first thing I", "22:40", "could have kind of wanted to do I", "22:41", "haven't had I've had a shower when I", "22:43", "have it I actually to save weight so I", "22:45", "could get as much food and fuel in my", "22:47", "sled I brought no extra clothes no extra", "22:49", "pair of underwear like literally no", "22:50", "extra pair of underwear no no", "22:52", "so where are you shitting out there", "22:54", "everyone wants to know this so let's", "22:56", "just get it on the table I'll give her a", "22:58", "skate basically I described that", "23:02", "vestibule situation so one side I cook", "23:04", "in right if the wind is calm I get out", "23:07", "of my tent dig a hole and and you know", "23:09", "go shit in a hole basically but when", "23:11", "it's real windy like those storms I just", "23:13", "watch like you're gonna get frostbite if", "23:14", "you try to you know bend over pull your", "23:15", "pants down once -80 out right so in the", "23:18", "vestibule of my tent not the side I'm", "23:19", "cooking on but the other side where I'm", "23:21", "still inside covered I dig a hole in", "23:23", "there and that was my morning routine", "23:25", "get up at 6:00 a.m. start pulling my", "23:26", "water on one side of my tent and it's", "23:28", "not glamorous it's not a pretty thing at", "23:31", "the bake of actually to me this is very", "23:33", "cool but also not glamorous within one", "23:35", "degree of latitude of the South Pole so", "23:38", "the last degree of latitude 89 degrees", "23:39", "south poles at 90 degrees basically 69", "23:42", "miles or 60 nautical miles circumference", "23:44", "around the South Pole Antarctica being", "23:46", "as pristine as it is they have all these", "23:48", "laws about environmental conservation", "23:50", "which to me is amazing being someone who", "23:52", "just loves and is a great steward of the", "23:53", "land they actually say you can't even", "23:55", "leave your human waste in holes here", "23:57", "even there's nobody out there they're", "23:58", "like we want this to be completely", "24:00", "protected area and so yes usually my", "24:03", "sled was getting lighter most of the", "24:05", "time because I was eating food every day", "24:07", "and burning fuel but in that last degree", "24:08", "of latitude to the South Pole and", "24:09", "crossing it I was shitting in a bag", "24:11", "wrapping it up and putting it in my sled", "24:14", "and having to carry it with me", "24:15", "so yeah Wow it shows discipline", "24:19", "[Laughter]", "24:21", "something a lot of people have been like", "24:23", "yeah yeah put it in the back fuck you", "24:28", "ones up there", "24:30", "who cares if I take a shit up there it", "24:32", "was tempting but you know so I grew up", "24:33", "in it going out in the outdoors it just", "24:35", "has Leave No Trace principle that I", "24:37", "really love and in particularly", "24:38", "Antarctica one of the things about", "24:39", "Antarctica it's one of those places", "24:41", "where imagine you've traveled far and", "24:43", "wide in your life and there's some few", "24:44", "places at least in my mind where you", "24:46", "just you can't put it into words until", "24:48", "you've stepped off you're there and for", "24:49", "me this is my second time in an article", "24:51", "both times you know this big cargo ship", "24:53", "basically lands you on the continent", "24:54", "then you get in a smaller plane to get", "24:56", "dropped off to where I needed to start", "24:57", "on the edge of the continent but both", "24:58", "times stepping off the plane I'm just", "25:01", "shit-eating grin ear to ear on my face", "25:03", "because I just am like whoa what is this", "25:06", "place even the second time seeing it I", "25:07", "felt like my cheeks were sore because I", "25:09", "was just smiling so big of just pristine", "25:12", "beauty the blank canvas the I mean you", "25:15", "look out on the landing like human", "25:17", "footprints haven't touched 98% of the", "25:19", "continent something like that I mean", "25:20", "it's untouched and so shitting in a bag", "25:23", "if I had to do that to do my part to", "25:25", "that way did you drag at the end it was", "25:31", "about three used the bags one per day", "25:35", "four at that section is about a hundred", "25:37", "twenty miles it took me I don't know a", "25:39", "week or so to cover that distance so", "25:40", "yeah added added weight to my sled", "25:43", "rather than subtracting during that was", "25:44", "the middle part of the journey right", "25:46", "around the 30th and fortieth day now how", "25:48", "did you calculate your nutrition so the", "25:50", "nutrition journey was actually", "25:52", "fascinating and to be honest in my", "25:54", "opinion people said well well how come", "25:56", "other people died trying or why did", "25:57", "other people not be able to do it", "25:58", "because one other guy ran out of food", "26:00", "and so when I was looking at this", "26:01", "journey you know we again we're calling", "26:03", "it the impossible first like how am I", "26:05", "going to make the impossible possible", "26:06", "and I thought that the nutrition piece", "26:08", "of it was going to be huge I actually my", "26:10", "dad's an organic farmer in Hawaii like", "26:12", "whole food health and nutrition has been", "26:14", "a big part of my personal journey and so", "26:17", "I found a company that was really in it", "26:19", "with me so this company called standard", "26:21", "processed they're a whole food", "26:22", "supplement company I'm really involved", "26:24", "in chiropractic as acupuncture and they", "26:27", "I presented them with this and I said", "26:29", "hey what do you guys think like is there", "26:31", "a way to like figure this out and", "26:33", "they're like well we have 20 of the top", "26:34", "doctors nutritionists food scientists", "26:37", "you know on our staff and this", "26:38", "Innovation Center around nutrition like", "26:40", "come in the lab with us and so they'd", "26:42", "never done this with an athlete", "26:44", "for but they were intrigued and so I", "26:45", "actually went and did a years-long worth", "26:47", "of you know hundred plus blood tests vo2", "26:50", "max tests all this fitness testing all", "26:52", "around my physiology and they created", "26:53", "ultimately a custom food solution as I", "26:55", "bar form essentially called the column", "26:57", "bar that was all whole food ingredients", "27:00", "it was no you know chemical derivatives", "27:01", "or anything it was you know coconut oil", "27:03", "you know seeds nuts you know all these", "27:05", "different pieces of macronutrients as", "27:07", "well as micronutrient blends that I", "27:08", "needed but custom tailored to my", "27:10", "physiology and that's what I mean that", "27:13", "was the bulk of what I ate I ate 7,000", "27:15", "calories per day I was burning 10,000 so", "27:18", "even at 7,000 I was losing about a pound", "27:20", "of day a weight of weight almost to my", "27:22", "bodies that's why I needed to get bigger", "27:24", "but these column bars just burned super", "27:26", "efficiently in my body like it was just", "27:28", "the perfect blend of everything so", "27:30", "eating the same thing every single day", "27:31", "or 54 days might have gotten a little", "27:32", "bit boring but my body was just it was", "27:34", "actually pretty dialed in Wow", "27:36", "now when they did this and they they", "27:39", "made these custom bars for you did they", "27:42", "know I mean how did you know how many", "27:45", "calories you're gonna be burning where", "27:46", "you're pulling is 300 pound sled was it", "27:49", "dependent upon the conditions like if", "27:50", "the snow was more packed or icy yeah", "27:55", "more difficult if it was soft right 100%", "27:58", "so I mean we had to use our best guess", "28:00", "honestly we had to just say let's use", "28:02", "our best guess I guys had a bunch of", "28:04", "smart people smarter than me we're in", "28:05", "this room all these doctors these PhDs", "28:07", "around this and we had to make some", "28:09", "assumptions and ultimately they were", "28:10", "like okay you're gonna burn 10,000", "28:12", "calories let's get you 10,000 calories", "28:13", "in these bars and we started running the", "28:15", "weight on the sled and we're like", "28:16", "that'll be a 500 pound slit like we", "28:18", "can't carry that so it's this equation", "28:20", "of like can you make this LED light", "28:22", "enough to pull if we can get the", "28:24", "nutrition right how efficiently does", "28:26", "that burn in your body how much can your", "28:27", "stomach absorb you're hungry the whole", "28:29", "time more or less yeah far yeah I was I", "28:32", "was ready for a big fucking meal which", "28:36", "was the first thing you ate this the", "28:39", "first thing I ate when I got back was a", "28:41", "big burger but you might call me lame", "28:43", "for saying this but I'm just gonna say", "28:45", "cuz it's the truth", "28:46", "what I craved was salad man what I", "28:47", "craved was just something because I you", "28:50", "know I mean I've been like this", "28:51", "freeze-dried filled this like chunk of", "28:53", "column bar which got me through but it", "28:55", "was like something green and alive and", "28:57", "so I", "28:57", "big salad like avocado and sadly no I", "29:00", "had a big burger too but then of course", "29:02", "I eat my stomach is shrunk right I ate", "29:05", "this big meal and I'm like oh my stomach", "29:07", "cometh hurts but motional II I was like", "29:09", "I'm back in the real world baby so it", "29:11", "was like it was everything I could get", "29:13", "my hands I would do a buffet just like", "29:14", "my stomach was hurting but I was like", "29:15", "I'm not gonna stop and I just started", "29:17", "eating like whatever croissants and", "29:19", "bread it was all the figs so I would", "29:23", "imagine your body would like you", "29:25", "probably craving all that life like live", "29:28", "things green the exact vegetables and", "29:31", "fruit it's weird to say I mean like I'm", "29:33", "from Portland Oregon you know it's", "29:35", "pretty green part of the world up there", "29:36", "in the Pacific Northwest and so you're", "29:38", "not even just the the food component but", "29:41", "an art there's nothing alive out there", "29:42", "there's no animals on the coast there", "29:44", "are but like in the interior I didn't", "29:46", "see any animals I'd see a bird I didn't", "29:48", "see you know nothing right and so not", "29:50", "only I think as humans were kind of", "29:52", "wired to see things living I mean even", "29:55", "here in LA bit of a concrete jungle but", "29:56", "like you see trees on this tree you see", "29:58", "the ocean yeah whatever yeah I sort of", "30:00", "not see anything alive for 54 days it", "30:03", "was like wow I want to like smell trees", "30:05", "fresh air and the trees I want to eat a", "30:07", "salad I don't know like that's where", "30:08", "like my mind got to is kind of coming", "30:10", "back to reality in that way man so when", "30:13", "they're constructing these bars for you", "30:16", "and this is all based on your body and", "30:19", "like what burns well with you how do", "30:22", "they like in terms of like how many cat", "30:26", "what's the best food in terms of weight", "30:29", "versus calories and is there some foods", "30:32", "that are heavier but don't have as many", "30:33", "calories yeah so I think I'm gonna get", "30:37", "the numbers pretty close to right here", "30:38", "but I think per our fat of course of the", "30:41", "macronutrients we got protein fat and", "30:43", "carbs right right fat is the most", "30:45", "calorie dense of them all you have to", "30:48", "make sure these things don't freeze", "30:49", "solid right that was one of the check it", "30:51", "was minus 25 in my sled every single day", "30:53", "so it had to actually be edible while", "30:55", "frozen essentially because it would be", "30:57", "too hard to rewarm them because this was", "30:58", "a food I was eating outside sled so was", "31:01", "actually frozen - frozen - but actually", "31:04", "where we where the workaround happened", "31:06", "were they kind of they're

"39:46", "like it's snowing cuz it's so windy that", "39:48", "the snow is blowing around everywhere", "39:49", "but I was locked in such a deep flow", "39:52", "state in my mind that even setting my", "39:54", "tent up in this crazy storm even getting", "39:56", "inside 18 hour push I was just like nope", "39:58", "I've got this and it felt like for me", "40:00", "when I reflect on that moment

culmination of my", "40:32", "entire life in a lot of ways like from", "40:34", "the swim practices as a little kid to", "40:36", "you know I got burned in this crazy fire", "40:39", "that I overcame in time like that if you", "40:40", "want I you know race triathlon", "40:42", "professionally all of these moments life", "40:44", "the meditation practice the the family", "40:46", "the support likes like all of these", "40:48", "things were stacking on each other to", "40:49", "kind of lead to this final culminating", "40:51", "moment and I had to pull on lessons from", "40:53", "each phase of my life to be that locked", "40:55", "in but I found myself just you know kind", "40:58", "of in that moment in that flow state", "41:00", "being able to get up out of that hour 18", "41:02", "and say to them actually I'm going back", "41:04", "out this crazy ground blizzard I got", "41:05", "another 14 hours to go to finish this", "41:07", "thing and so that was you know 32 hours", "41:09", "and 77 miles later that the final push", "41:11", "to the end now what did you wear in", "41:15", "terms of like a base layer and we was", "41:18", "you're concerned about you sweating", "41:19", "while you're pulling all that weight", "41:21", "especially initially when I was 375", "41:23", "pounds yeah so you know one of the the", "41:25", "famous lines that you know people who", "41:27", "have been in the polar environments will", "41:28", "say is if you sweat you die and you know", "41:32", "it's maybe a little bit of hyperbole but", "41:33", "it's not far from the truth which is you", "41:35", "start sweating and you stop for even 30", "41:38", "seconds your clothes are literally", "41:39", "freezing to your body and so it was this", "41:42", "crazy kind of kind of balance of being", "41:45", "able to pull this sled get your heart", "41:46", "rate elevated enough to keep your body", "41:48", "warm but not too warm that you were", "41:50", "sweating and so any second I would start", "41:52", "sweating I would strip layers off so", "41:54", "there was times especially when there", "41:55", "was no wind it still be ambient", "41:57", "temperature - 20 - 25 but I would just", "41:59", "have like a thin gore-tex jacket on and", "42:01", "one base layer that's it I mean we", "42:03", "wearing merino my merino actually itches", "42:06", "my skin although it's really good I'm a", "42:08", "little bit allergic to it so I work", "42:10", "synthetic fabric do they have a", "42:12", "synthetic that completely mimics merino", "42:14", "in terms of the way when it's moist you", "42:16", "still stay warm yeah so Mirena", "42:18", "honestly Marino is amazing fabric for", "42:20", "that reason unfortunately for me like I", "42:21", "said it just irritates it is so funny", "42:23", "that you could suffer but sorry is", "42:32", "synthetic but what company are you using", "42:33", "like what what I was using Mountain", "42:36", "Hardwear base layers and then actually", "42:38", "my outer layer so this norwegian company", "42:39", "called bergens of norway they don't", "42:41", "sponsor me but they actually believe it", "42:43", "or not the Norwegians know a thing or", "42:45", "two about being in the polar environment", "42:46", "and so they've designed a really good", "42:48", "jacket and pant that's actually really", "42:50", "breathable and really good and then I", "42:51", "suit sewed a fur rough on to the edge so", "42:54", "a wolf a wolf fur a rough on the outer", "42:58", "side of the hood I think is wolf yeah", "43:00", "wool fur wolf fur I thought you were", "43:02", "saying wool when I was like it sounds", "43:04", "like wolf you know more about this than", "43:06", "me I'm not the alpha dog know your", "43:08", "audience I have nothing I am not a big", "43:09", "hunter myself I've never had never had", "43:11", "done that a lot of that but yeah so wolf", "43:14", "fur well they know how to survive in the", "43:15", "cold yeah exactly so the base layer is a", "43:18", "synthetic what is the material that it's", "43:20", "made out of the base layer is yeah it's", "43:22", "a it's a synthetic like a poly", "43:24", "polypropylene and so it when it sweats", "43:27", "it dries quickly yeah it's what sweats", "43:29", "it dries quickly but the idea was just", "43:31", "to not get it wet so basically stripped", "43:33", "down as much as possible but like", "43:35", "literally I'd go from that and then of", "43:37", "course I needed to eat and drink every", "43:38", "whatever 30 minutes or whatever actually", "43:41", "more like every hour so I'd stop so I'd", "43:43", "stop in the front of my sled I had a", "43:45", "huge puffy down Jack like a massive like", "43:47", "Michelin Man huge Buffy down jacket so", "43:49", "even if you're stopping for a minute to", "43:51", "drink water before even trying to do", "43:53", "that boom put the big jacket on because", "43:55", "that's no cold or how cold you can get", "43:58", "immediately from stopping I mean it's", "43:59", "just so much colder than when pulling", "44:01", "the sled your heart rate stays up and", "44:02", "keeps you pretty warm I would imagine", "44:03", "like your your hands and your feet too", "44:06", "that would be a real issue right the", "44:07", "small digits yeah I mean you know frost", "44:09", "bites real for sure hands outside of", "44:12", "gloves that's why some of the stuff I", "44:13", "was doing in the training of get my", "44:15", "hands with the dexterity you know you", "44:16", "have to tie all these knots with big", "44:17", "gloves mittens on you can't take your", "44:19", "gloves off for any sizable period of", "44:20", "time if you look back on a lot of my", "44:22", "photos I've actually got tape on my face", "44:24", "over crossed my nose and there and", "44:27", "that's because I started getting tiny", "44:28", "little bits of frostbite on the bottoms", "44:30", "of my nose and", "44:31", "on my cheeks because I'd wear a", "44:33", "full-face mask buff everything but even", "44:35", "you know tiny little you know one you", "44:38", "know needle prick of wind on your face", "44:40",

"44:47", "looking to grease your face up or", "44:48", "anything like mostly the the tape and", "44:51", "then I had a little bit of like Vaseline", "44:53", "or like chapstick type of stuff on some", "44:54", "of the bad areas the one thing actually", "44:55", "that I did that I'd never done before", "44:59", "would actually worked well was a tip", "45:00", "that I got which was my finger started", "45:01", "cracking really really bad from the cold", "45:04", "and so they were like really painful and", "45:05", "I actually was pouring putting superglue", "45:07", "into all of those basically little micro", "45:10", "cuts on my fingers which when someone", "45:12", "told me that as a trick I was like", "45:13", "really but turns out it's actually a", "45:15", "really good trick so it's kind of super", "45:17", "gluing these cuts on my fingers back", "45:19", "together and that actually worked", "45:21", "reasonably well all things considered", "45:23", "it's the operative

oh", "69:45", "my god another hard day out here oh my", "69:47", "god it's - 25 - tapping into those flow", "69:49", "states so yeah again I don't I don't", "69:51", "have perfect words for that you know I'm", "69:53", "starting to try to build my vocabulary", "69:55", "around that but that energy I think it", "69:57", "is derived from what you're saying if", "69:58", "you start to believe it if you can", "69:59", "believe like hey there's a larger", "70:01", "purpose in this or hey there's blue", "70:03", "forcefields get one foot there is", "70:05", "something that if you can originate that", "70:06", "positivity in your mind that I think can", "70:08", "give us incredible amounts of strength", "70:10", "and then we can tap into something", "70:12", "greater well I think there's definitely", "70:14", "something to what you were saying about", "70:15", "the untapped limits of the human", "70:16", "potential and that there's most people", "70:18", "barely scratch the surface of

really think", "97:28", "about too much which is your body's not", "97:30", "getting so the air actually has just as", "97:32", "much oxygen in it as it does at sea", "97:34", "level but the air is

changes right so the high", "97:45", "altitude is actually the pressure that's", "97:46", "changing it's not less oxygen there's", "97:48", "just as much oxygen but in a less dense", "97:50", "form so in the same volume of breath", "97:52", "you're getting less actual Oh two into", "97:54", "your blood what are you getting our", "97:55", "altitude", "97:56", "I guess carbon dioxide alright yeah I'm", "97:59", "not a doctor like I said you're getting", "98:04", "less oxygen your body so what ends up", "98:05", "happening is your muscles of course need", "98:07", "oxygen to perform so normally

you're", "98:21", "gonna die there's something wrong with", "98:22", "you like it's also a you know a key", "98:24", "marker of elite performance you know", "98:26", "that of course but what happens is your", "98:31", "body can't provides getting so little", "98:33", "oxygen even as your blood is", "98:34", "acclimatizing you're sleeping with a", "98:36", "resting heart rate at altitude on", "98:37", "Everest it like ninety hundred beats per", "98:39", "minute so you know that's pretty", "98:41", "elevated heart rate 24 hours a day and", "98:44", "for in my case for a hundred and thirty",
