"perspective", "06:06", "they were just calling me more names and", "06:08", "trying to set up straw man and is this", "06:11", "egyptologist who was in that documentary", "06:12", "who dismissed everything it was mark", "06:14", "still around oh yeah and as he amended", "06:17", "his position at all not to my knowledge", "06:20", "I haven't spoken with him for years and", "06:23", "years and years did you ever speak with", "06:25", "him off the record personally alone yeah", "06:28", "yeah I'll tell you this is but he didn't", "06:31", "say was off the record house I guess was", "06:33", "off the record I don't think I was said", "06:35", "this years ago but I'll say now at that", "06:37", "debate at that debate reply yes debate", "06:40", "he I just suddenly found him myself in", "06:45", "the hall with him and there was no one", "06:47", "else around so he could totally deny", "06:49", "this but it's true my perspective at", "06:52", "least he said something to me like you", "06:57", "know you don't really believe this I", "06:59", "know you don't really believe this you", "07:00", "just want to be on television and you", "07:03", "know be famous or something like that he", "07:06", "said I said no I really do believe it or", "07:10", "you know I really go by the evidence and", "07:12", "I do think the evidence says this and he", "07:14", "serve was telling me that no you don't", "07:17", "you know he was like I don't know I know", "07:19", "I see ye magnetizing you yeah yeah yeah", "07:23", "and then easily then and then and then", "07:25", "what he does is he starts asking me a", "07:27", "question some detailed question about", "07:30", "the geology and well if that's the case", "07:31", "how can such and such and I think it in", "07:35", "hindsight might have been fed to him by", "07:36", "some geo archaeologists as they call", "07:40", "someone who does archaeology but knows a", "07:41", "little geology ah", "07:43", "and I realize in hindsight it was meant", "07:47", "to be one of those gotcha questions I", "07:50", "guess they say nowadays where I wouldn't", "07:51", "be able to answer it but no I of course", "07:54", "I thought about it it was to me as a", "07:56", "geologist very obvious so I start giving", "07:58", "him this detailed explanation as to why", "08:00", "that's not the case and why you know my", "08:02", "evidence stands up bla bla bla and we're", "08:06", "standing there face to face I'm", "08:08", "explaining this to him and I see his", "08:10", "face sir turn and it goes blank and I'm", "08:13", "in mid-sentence he just turns around and", "08:15", "walks away he says when I realize he", "08:18", "couldn't he couldn't refute what you", "08:20", "were saying no you can't refute what I", "08:21", "was saying and he wasn't really answer", "08:23", "my takeaway is that he wasn't interested", "08:26", "in discussing it rationally or ants you", "08:30", "know he just wanted to win the debate or", "08:34", "whatever but so when Charlie and I met", "08:38", "and I like I told him like my plan to", "08:40", "sort of help black America and to wake", "08:41", "them up because I understood how we had", "08:43", "fallen victims of his brainwash", "08:44", "whimpering washes the leftist dogma", "08:48", "there's this idea that because we're", "08:49", "black we have to vote Democrat in any", "08:51", "way that is not a democrat is racist and", "08:52", "against helping us", "08:53", "that is like what so many black", "08:55", "Americans believe I believed it I", "08:56", "believed it you know what I mean so

I fall", "09:07", "victim to it the exact same system right", "09:09", "these three verticals the first being", "09:10", "the family the breakdown of the family", "09:11", "the second one being culture which then", "09:14", "to me like growing up it was like jay-z", "09:16", "like jay-z was God to me like I like", "09:18", "would throw on like I was you know I", "09:19", "went through a lot of stuff when I was a", "09:20", "kid I didn't have a great family you", "09:22", "know but I would throw on a jay-z album", "09:24", "and like whatever he said was like it", "09:26", "was like going to church you know and", "09:28", "then and I can't stand him now but the", "09:30", "third one oh no because he he knows", "09:33", "exactly what he's doing and he's a", "09:34", "traitor but third vertical being", "09:36", "education which was what casual side", "09:40", "trader yeah it's like like Beyonce the", "09:42", "underneath because he knows what's", "09:44", "happening to black America and he's", "09:45", "somebody that built his entire career", "09:47", "off the backs of black America you know", "09:49", "of being the guy who started in the hood", "09:51", "in in you know Queens and worked you", "09:54", "know as a drug dealer and worked his way", "09:55", "up and it became the idol for Sony fill", "09:57", "in black America and then he stands on", "09:59", "stage and

present history the United States", "10:07", "Bill Clinton right the person that", "10:09", "stands on the crime bill of 94 is Bill", "10:10", "Clinton but because jay-z is now focused", "10:13", "on getting a piece of the pie the", "10:14", "globalist piece of the pie he doesn't", "10:15", "care about black America that's that's", "10:17", "my opinion", "10:18", "so why I think that's what it was or do", "10:21", "you think that maybe he thought that", "10:22", "Donald Trump represented a lot of races", "10:24", "white people know he doesn't want that", "10:25", "office not even kind of for a
