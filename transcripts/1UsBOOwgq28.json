off it's like a", "18:06", "little shit and dog I would feel real", "18:08", "bad for him", "18:10", "so with that sad I do have this thing", "18:13", "where you kind of root and I do feel sad",

old-timey oh that's a good dude", "18:52", "you're fair not I'll call him he is a", "18:53", "good guy people see in in like", "18:59", "Yellowstone Park atmosphere you see", "19:01", "where wildlife becomes habituated to", "19:03", "humans and they feel like they're seeing", "19:04", "something more natural right because", "19:06", "outside of human hunting they often", "19:09", "don't have that feeling anymore I look", "19:11", "at that and I see that it's like um to", "19:13", "me it feels like something's been", "19:15", "subverted and something's wrong with", "19:16", "that situation yeah because it sort of", "19:18", "depends on how fresh your perspective is", "19:20", "because I mean people have been hunting", "19:23", "you know people have been hunting in", "19:25", "that area I mean at least 10,000 years", "19:28", "so then we take like a hundred year", "19:30", "break and the animals become very", "19:33", "accustomed to people it's it's shocking", "19:36", "how quickly they can get it back and", "19:38", "oftentimes those same elk that live like", "19:41", "the same elk that will spend their", "19:43", "summer in that Park will migrate out of", "19:45", "there and

thing but", "21:11", "also wow it's one thing that I've", "21:14", "discovered over the last seven years", "21:16", "thanks to you and thanks to you getting", "21:18", "me hunting is that most people

can", "24:07", "drive an hour from your house and then", "24:09", "you're around bears and do an Eagles I", "24:12", "mean it's a completely wild place but", "24:15", "people that are in those areas

fucking enormous", "24:38", "mountain lion I mean it is huge it's a", "24:40", "big boy it's like 150 pounds and they're", "24:43", "in the car and they're looking at it", "24:44", "through the window

saying that like somebody was", "24:53", "filmed somebody was feeding it", "24:54", "apparently and they're trying to figure", "24:56", "out what you want me saying to you I'll", "24:59", "send it to you but this you know that's", "25:02", "that's super rare I mean that's a real", "25:05", "wild animal it's super super Rael that", "25:07", "that anybody would have any kind of", "25:09",

"25:27", "live around and work around and deal", "25:29", "with animals and people who view them or", "25:32", "think of them as very other a friend of", "25:35", "mine who's a biologist this is all there", "25:37", "you go yeah", "25:38", "nope no I'm sending you another one I", "25:40", "sent it to you it's it's from Thousand", "25:42", "Oaks I just had to you know that's a", "25:46", "recent one too Oh buddy man who's the", "25:48", "biologist with the Forest Service guy", "25:50", "named Carl Malcolm he might have heard", "25:52", "on our our show he just sent me a paper", "25:56",

"26:22", "you the top-of-mind wildlife they know", "26:24", "about its non-native stuff like lions", "26:28", "yeah they're likely to know like what's", "26:30", "what's an animal right and an animal be", "26:33", "like to be like a giraffe right and and", "26:36", "people who", "26:38", "have a more rural or remote viewpoint", "26:43", "will be are much more likely to look", "26:46", "when they think of wild like to think of", "26:47", "things that they interact with mmm you", "26:49", "know and not like the things that are on", "26:50", "your mobile above your crib when you're", "26:54", "a little baby and it sort of points that", "26:56", "and also there's a slight tendency I got", "26:59", "to look at this more carefully but it's", "27:00", "a slight tendency to have negative", "27:04", "feelings or think things are dangerous", "27:06", "or bad the more urban you are in terms", "27:10", "of native wildlife to more recognize it", "27:13", "as like a negative or bad thing and what", "27:15", "they're pointing to is again I want to", "27:18", "look at this much more carefully and", "27:19", "pardon me to the authors authors if I", "27:21", "mess up I'll just looking at this", "27:22", "morning what they're pointing to is the", "27:26", "the the stirrings of there being a", "27:30", "greater acceptance of decreased", "27:32", "biodiversity hmm meaning that you're", "27:34", "kind of like okay with the bad things", "27:37", "having gone and we're focused on like", "27:39", "what are animals well animals would be", "27:41", "like a draft and hippopotamus and the", "27:43", "things that that Disney tells me about", "27:46", "not like opossums and raccoons which are", "27:48", "kind of gross hmm you know get that", "27:52", "video look at this fat boy play this", "27:56", "thing it's collar didn't it yeah it's", "28:00", "got a collar on it uh it's interesting I", "28:02", "could see that better there's a lot of", "28:04", "them out here that have collars we got a", "28:06", "photo that we just had commissioned and", "28:08", "she get here soon right yeah it's huge", "28:11", "of the the big cat that they", "28:14", "photographed near the Hollywood sign", "28:15", "yeah it looks like it's staged I mean", "28:17", "the cat is walking right by the trail", "28:19", "camera in the halls that do the sets of", "28:21", "those famous uh yeah there's a National", "28:24", "Geographic yes yeah yeah that's a good", "28:25", "picture yeah we got one printed on snap", "28:28", "that picture right there I mean come on", "28:29", "man that's crazy that is a goddamn crazy", "28:32", "picture it's a giant cat like who the", "28:35", "forearms on that motherfucker", "28:36", "well that saggy stomach but it bums me", "28:39", "out looking at that collar there was a", "28:41", "conversation that you had on your", "28:42", "podcast about shooting a deer that's", "28:46", "wearing a collar and I'm with you I'm", "28:48", "with you 100%", "28:49", "I don't want to shoot a deer that's", "28:50", "wearing a collar I don't", "28:51", "it's wild as fuck they caught it when I", "28:53", "was a baby and they just waited and", "28:55", "measured it and then let it go", "28:57", "and it didn't have a collar and I saw", "28:59", "that deer I wouldn't think twice about", "29:00", "shooting it but if I saw it and it was", "29:02", "wearing a collar I'm like I'm out nope", "29:04", "totally but there's a really funny thing", "29:06", "and you might have you probably caught", "29:07", "wind of this or know about this is that", "29:10", "it's a big deal yeah to shoot a duck", "29:12", "with a band on it everybody knows is", "29:14", "cool as shit like I know that everybody", "29:17", "wants to shoot a band", "29:18", "most people listen this don't know that", "29:19", "it's cool as shit if you get a band duck", "29:23", "why is that well it's a little bit", "29:24", "social science because long ago like we", "29:28", "used to not understand this can little", "29:33", "bit tricky to explain we used to not", "29:37", "understand how migrations worked because", "29:40", "everyone he only knew what they saw okay", "29:44", "and there wasn't someone who was sort of", "29:46", "like coalescing all of this information", "29:48", "people would know very well like you", "29:51", "know wherever you live along the", "29:53", "Mississippi River okay and you might", "29:57", "know very well that like in November", "29:59", "shitloads docks that you haven't seen", "30:01", "they have been here all year are coming", "30:04", "from the north and going to the south", "30:07", "and you knew that very well", "30:09", "you knew that ducks moved you knew that", "30:11", "they move through here but you didn't", "30:14", "put all of the you had no way to put all", "30:16", "the pieces together over time we wanted", "30:21", "to understand like animal migrations", "30:23", "better in one of the early this is way", "30:24", "pre collars like GPS collars and then", "30:26", "pit tags and shit", "30:29", "we started this banding system where you", "30:31", "could go and catch a duck and it's we're", "30:35", "in its nesting area there's like times a", "30:37", "year when it's really easy to catch", "30:38", "ducks one even catch them when they're", "30:39", "young and you can catch them when they", "30:40", "molt so people would go out and put a", "30:42", "band on a duck and you'd go you could go", "30:43", "up and in the Arctic or the Upper", "30:45", "Midwest anywhere and throw a band on a", "30:47", "baby duck and that band would have a", "30:49", "phone number on it and you were", "30:52", "encouraged to when you got a banded duck", "30:56", "it was like they made it be that it was", "30:58", "a good thing and you were encouraged to", "31:00", "call that 1-800 number or whatever the", "31:03", "hell they were before 100", "31:05", "and given the the band the band number", "31:08", "and then we started to really with like", "31:10", "great detail map out flyways how ducks", "31:14", "migrated like that the ducks in on the", "31:17", "Arctic slope and Alaska tend to follow", "31:20", "along this path and they tend to end up", "31:22", "here at this date there down and you", "31:25", "know whatever they're down in Texas all", "31:27", "of a sudden are they're down in Southern", "31:29", "California", "31:29", "and they're hanging out in rice fields", "31:32", "around Sacramento or whatever held is we", "31:33", "started to put together this whole", "31:34", "detailed picture and it was one of the", "31:36", "great achievements and wildlife biology", "31:38", "was what we learned from the duck", "31:40", "banding system so I think that over time", "31:44", "it began like I said it was sort of like", "31:46", "social engineering where people were", "31:48", "taught to think it was cool and you", "31:51", "would wear and a band you would if you", "31:53", "had a lanyard you keep your duck calls", "31:55", "on this still goes on if you got a", "31:57", "lanyard every duck calls on any banded", "32:00", "bird you get you put that band on your", "32:01", "lanyard I even met these knuckleheads", "32:04", "from North Dakota who have a lot of", "32:08", "bands on their lanyards from banded", "32:10", "Birds they've shot and you bet I do", "32:12", "that's a lot of bands he goes yeah not", "32:14", "one of them's reported mm-hmm", "32:17", "they think that it that it remains more", "32:19", "pure to do it I don't know that's the", "32:24", "dumbest shit ever it's the dumbest shit", "32:26", "I wish you guys did like why would", "32:27", "anybody want to contribute to oh I don't", "32:29", "know you'd have to have like a calling", "32:31", "component to your show and we would call", "32:33", "one of these dudes and have an explained", "32:35", "in greater detail I remember thinking", "32:36", "like that's the most that that's the", "32:38", "most fucked up thing I've ever heard but", "32:39", "yeah I'm think you'd want to talk to", "32:40", "that guy it was like he's like yeah", "32:41", "they're all unreported anyways I don't", "32:43", "know if it's like an anti-science but", "32:45", "you love to argue did you talk to that", "32:46", "guy about this you know it was long ago", "32:48", "I could take where I was standing I was", "32:50", "in my brother's kitchen - Miles City", "32:51", "Montana beneath this crazy chandelier he", "32:54", "bought online and I remember everything", "32:55", "about it I don't remember when I if I", "32:57", "challenged him on the sense of being", "33:01", "proud of having not contributed to our", "33:03", "scientific understanding of waterfowl", "33:06", "migrations and why maybe it looked like", "33:08", "a sort of anti-government sentiment like", "33:11", "some black helicopter stuff", "33:13", "okay regardless yeah it's a malicious", "33:15", "shit it's cool to have bans and I have", "33:18", "like in my sort of I have like a box", "33:20", "where I put important stuff to me but", "33:22", "imagine if you had a box of deer collars", "33:24", "dude there's no way if eyes", "33:26", "I wouldn't put into your cock that's", "33:28", "what I'm getting as like those are cool", "33:30", "but collars are not and we had a friend", "33:31", "there's a there's a friend of mine who's", "33:33", "a she's a does a lot of carnivore", "33:35", "research and other research projects", "33:37", "named Carmen van Bianchi which is a cool", "33:39", "name but she says that you know I'm", "33:42", "someone that collars animals and I even", "33:46", "think that she's like when you get one", "33:48", "with a collar on it she said it was", "33:50", "quote I we talk with us here today or", "33:52", "she's like someone has already got the", "33:54", "best of them that they become tainted", "33:57", "when they've been held by someone else", "33:59", "and that's a little bit how I view it", "34:01", "we're like a wild animal you want to", "34:04", "imagine it being like the wildest wild", "34:06", "animal and once it has a collar it's", "34:08", "like someone it's it's all sloppy", "34:11", "seconds man yeah", "34:12", "well isn't that why the allure of Alaska", "34:15", "is so interesting because it's one of", "34:17", "the rare places where like if you run", "34:19", "into a caribou in Alaska there's a high", "34:22", "probability that never encountered a", "34:23", "person never it doesn't even know what", "34:25", "you are like you've seen videos of", "34:27", "hunters walking towards caribou with", "34:29", "like their bow on their head you know", "34:32", "and the caribou is like what and the", "34:34", "fuck is this you don't even know they", "34:36", "think that bow is a rack their", "34:38", "assumption in areas where I've been", "34:42", "particularly like look up on the Arctic", "34:44", "slope know if that troops have seen a", "34:47", "lot in the mountain ranges - in", "34:49", "south-central Alaska when they see your", "34:52", "movement their assumption is that you're", "34:57", "a caribou that's like that scene I can't", "35:00", "you can't get in their head but their", "35:02", "assumption is that like oh I better go", "35:03", "check it out and then I'll circle", "35:04", "downwind to make sure it's not a make", "35:07", "sure it's not a grizzly or a wolf or", "35:09", "whatever but they're like you know uh", "35:11", "something the weighs a few hundred", "35:13", "pounds couple hundred pounds whatever", "35:15", "walking around
