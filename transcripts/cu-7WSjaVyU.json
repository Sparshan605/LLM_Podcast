"06:30", "know he studied it and it was like what", "06:32", "is it that causes muscle growth what is", "06:34", "it and he found it was an intensity of", "06:37", "exercise and then there was another", "06:39", "bodybuilder Mike", "06:40", "Manso went to compete in the mr. olympia", "06:42", "when the mr. universe he took those", "06:44", "principles and he used them so I read", "06:47", "all this stuff and it was very logical", "06:48", "you know it made sense and then I tried", "06:51", "it out in the gym and it worked in the", "06:54", "gym and if I trained more often or if I", "06:57", "did more in the gym my progress was", "06:59", "slowed down or it would stop as soon as", "07:00", "I cut back and I made the workout", "07:02", "shorter and more intense my progress", "07:05", "went so it was for me it was pretty", "07:07", "early on I learned how to train properly", "07:08", "and that's why I was competing I", "07:10", "competed in a World Championship after", "07:12", "18 months training which is pretty much", "07:14", "unheard of that is pretty much unheard", "07:16", "of now when you say shorter more intense", "07:19", "workouts how did you regulate that like", "07:21", "that is that's a huge issue with martial", "07:23", "artists is over training they want to do", "07:25", "more work than everybody else they want", "07:27", "to work harder than everybody else and", "07:28", "they wind up breaking their body down", "07:30", "and showing up for the fight exhausted", "07:32", "overtraining is a big thing and if you", "07:34", "you see the the process for muscle", "07:37", "growth is you go in the gym and you put", "07:39", "stress on the muscle if you put stress", "07:40", "that it's not used to then it's going to", "07:43", "react you're going to get growth but you", "07:44", "need to recover from that first you", "07:46", "don't go to the gym and grow and then", "07:48", "recover later that's that's not the way", "07:50", "it works you go if you've you know you", "07:53", "give some your body some stress is not", "07:55", "used to you'll get a reaction but before", "07:57", "you get the reaction you have to recover", "07:59", "so if you're not allowing enough time to", "08:01", "recover you just I use this analogy at", "08:03", "seminars I do it's very simplistic but", "08:05", "it gets the point across if you get a", "08:07", "bit of sandpaper and you rub it across", "08:09", "the palm of your hand and it's kind of", "08:11", "bloody if you leave it and let it heal", "08:13", "up what's gonna happen the skin's going", "08:15", "to develop back a little bit stronger a", "08:17", "little bit thicker than before because", "08:18", "it wants to protect against that stress", "08:20", "so that's the process but if you go and", "08:23", "you make your hand bloody and before", "08:24", "it's healed up again you go and rub it", "08:26", "again what's happening you're not really", "08:28", "getting any we're just gonna have a", "08:29", "bloody hand you know you think you're", "08:31", "being tough but you're actually just", "08:32", "being silly yeah and that's why are you", "08:35", "going to the gym right I'm going to the", "08:37", "gym to get results so I'm gonna do", "08:38", "whatever it takes to get results and if", "08:40", "it means training thirty minutes once a", "08:41", "week or it means training ten hours a", "08:43", "day every day whatever it takes I was", "08:45", "willing to do it and I would have done", "08:46", "it but training ten hours a day is not", "08:49", "gonna build your muscle is just gonna", "08:50", "burn out so I was doing average 4550", "08:54", "minute workouts probably four times a", "08:56", "week no really that's it and everybody", "08:59", "say oh that's it whether I write on a", "09:01", "piece of paper what the fuck is that", "09:03", "that's nothing man I'm like okay what", "09:05", "come and do it come and do it and tell", "09:07", "me if you want to do more when we're", "09:08", "finished nobody's ever said oh please", "09:11", "come and do some more they're like no", "09:12", "that's it that's enough because every", "09:15", "set bother warm-up sets you got a", "09:17", "warm-up and you know to be safe and", "09:19", "everything but the set the real sets I", "09:21", "call them we're going to go to absolute", "09:24", "failure and even beyond with force reps", "09:26", "with assistance reps maybe extra", "09:28", "negative reps which is something most", "09:31", "people in the collect when they lift", "09:33", "weights they think you know I've lifted", "09:34", "it all right let me go down I've lifted", "09:37", "it but they're neglecting the lowering", "09:39", "part of the weight they're negative so I", "09:41", "get people to really slow that down so", "09:43", "you're taxed in that part as well and", "09:44", "even at the end of the set on some", "09:46", "exercises with machines where it's", "09:48", "practical so you know you can't curl", "09:50", "anymore physically on the positive on", "09:52", "the contraction but your strength on the", "09:54", "lowering is greater so if you did curls", "09:57", "and you failed I could lift the weight", "09:58", "to the top for you and you could lower", "10:00", "it down for probably another three reps", "10:01", "so if you just gone to failure here you", "10:04", "wouldn't have exhausted the the negative", "10:06", "part of the rep so my thing is exhaust", "10:07", "everything it's totally fucked you can't", "10:10", "lift you can't lower it you can't lift", "10:11", "it it's total failure if you do that one", "10:14", "sudden exercises then time to move on do", "10:17", "another exercise how did you develop", "10:18", "your protocol just trial and error trial", "10:21", "and error and you know I didn't invent", "10:23", "this system of training as I said people", "10:25", "there before me Arthur Jones might", "10:26", "mentor I just taught what they did and", "10:28", "refined it a little bit more for a", "10:30", "competitive bodybuilder because Arthur", "10:32", "Jones was a competitive bodybuilder", "10:33", "people who trained weren't so his his", "10:36", "routines were even briefer than mine but", "10:38", "for a bodybuilding you know you could", "10:39", "you got to work the side dial you got to", "10:42", "work different aspects so I probably did", "10:44", "a little bit more than they did so I", "10:46", "adapted it to myself and my needs now", "10:49", "when you were at your height and when", "10:50", "you're 265 pounds shredded and", "10:52", "dehydrated and and then 310 pounds in", "10:55", "the offseason you got you must be like", "10:58", "used to looking at yourself like that", "11:00", "like was it hard to adapt to being that", "11:03", "mean you're still obviously a very fit", "11:04", "guy but you're a normal sight like if I", "11:07", "saw you I'd be like", "11:08", "there's a normal fit guy yeah that's", "11:10", "what I want to be now I'm not training", "11:12", "for bodybuilding because it's not what I", "11:14", "want to do now plus I got a lot of", "11:16", "injuries from a little super heavy", "11:18", "weights I did I got a torn rotator cuff", "11:19", "which is not I've had a couple surgeries", "11:22", "on there it doesn't repair so you know I", "11:25", "was trying to you know lift weights and", "11:27", "continue to do in what I do because", "11:28", "that's what I'm used to doing right", "11:30", "right and when you're familiar with", "11:32", "doing something you're reluctant to", "11:33", "change something else but I noticed you", "11:36", "know over that my shoulders getting a", "11:37", "bit worse my hips were getting you know", "11:39", "I'm like hold on is this serving me now", "11:42", "why am I doing this am i doing this just", "11:44", "to try and maintain something for other", "11:47", "people what they think I should look", "11:48", "like right and I kind of came to the", "11:50", "conclusion yeah you are because you're", "11:51", "not you're not a bodybuilder anymore", "11:53", "you're not competing right so if doing", "11:56", "this kind of training is not really", "11:58", "benefiting you and maybe making your", "12:00", "injuries worse you know when you're 60", "12:02", "or something you're gonna not be able to", "12:04", "like lift your arms up or something like", "12:05", "that so I'm thinking more practically", "12:07", "and I started doing yoga and you know I", "12:11", "really fell in love with that it's", "12:14", "amazing isn't it yeah it's amazing as", "12:16", "physically it's amazing", "12:17", "I got much more range of motion mobility", "12:20", "and then you got the spiritual aspect of", "12:23", "as well so actually that I was inspired", "12:27", "to do yoga from DMT trip predator DMT", "12:31", "trip and I came back and I was like my", "12:33", "body's all fucked up there's this thing", "12:35", "right like I gotta fix some stuff here", "12:37", "what shall I do and I didn't even I knew", "12:41", "what yoga was but I don't really know", "12:42", "what it was and I got to do something", "12:44", "got to do yoga or Tai Chi I don't know", "12:46", "what it is but started looking into it", "12:48", "and then found a yoga teacher and I'll", "12:50", "do that a couple times a week I found", "12:51", "it's it's great every time I do it I", "12:53", "just think I should do more this morning", "12:55", "and I got up this morning did with yoga", "12:57", "class 8 o'clock Gold's Gym and you know", "13:00", "on an empty stomach just had some water", "13:02", "and some tea and I fucking feel amazing", "13:03", "on that well it just to me it feels like", "13:06", "it connects everything it connects all", "13:08", "the tissue from the back to the legs to", "13:11", "the arms as like the neck and thus the", "13:13", "core it strengthens all the connecting", "13:16", "stuff and just a new energy flow yes", "13:18", "going around", "13:20", "and that's the thing with bodybuilding", "13:22", "because bodybuilding you're isolating", "13:25", "the muscles right so you're isolating", "13:26", "your bicep isolating the tricep", "13:27", "isolating the deltoids and putting", "13:29", "stress on those muscles to maximize the", "13:31", "muscle size of those individual muscles", "13:33", "right which is great for bodybuilding", "13:36", "but your body doesn't function like that", "13:39", "you know right if you throw something", "13:41", "you throw a punch or you know you don't", "13:44", "use one muscle use the you know it's", "13:47", "Chalian affect the whole body works", "13:49", "together and the body bone you don't", "13:51", "really do that you don't learn to do", "13:52", "that so that's what I've had to relearn", "13:54", "you know so when you exercise today like", "13:56", "what kind of stuff do you do besides", "13:58", "yoga I do yoga do some cycling I live in", "14:01", "Spain we've got some good hills there so", "14:03", "I do because I like to push me and I", "14:05", "can't push the weights anymore I can't", "14:06", "get in that zone you know because of my", "14:09", "injuries so I got to do something else", "14:10", "Yoga is a challenge you know and it", "14:13", "continue to be like if I do that until", "14:15", "I'm dropped down dead 80 years old", "14:17", "there's always more that I can do you", "14:19", "know you can always do a bit more rains", "14:21", "or a bit more difficult pose so there's", "14:23", "no there's no ceiling there you know", "14:24", "with the bodybuilding I already been on", "14:26", "the ceiling yeah you know I do cycling a", "14:30", "couple of times a week up and down the", "14:31", "hills so that's like you know it's got", "14:34", "almost like intervals because you do a", "14:35", "hill it's intense and then you go flat", "14:37", "and it's a bit easier so I enjoyed doing", "14:39", "that you moved to Spain well I lived in", "14:43", "UK and I started visiting Spain because", "14:45", "in Marbella and Spain the south coast of", "14:48", "Spain it's got a very big British", "14:49",

the heap where there was", "29:48", "there was debate as to like what a", "29:51", "bodybuilder should look like there was", "29:53", "like the Frank Zane look which was like", "29:56", "a strong obviously fit guy but much", "30:00", "smaller and just symmetrical and then", "30:03", "there was you that just came out with", "30:04", "the fucking Hulk you know and then it", "30:07", "was almost like overwhelming for a lot", "30:09", "of people and then there was this debate", "30:11", "to try to figure out absolutely because", "30:12", "when I look at a bunch of bodybuilders", "30:15", "on a stage and they're trying to pick", "30:17", "out who's number one who's number two", "30:18", "much oh yeah I mean I always assume that", "30:21", "it's like a lot of other things like the", "30:23",

"30:32", "tell who's the best well it's a matter", "30:35", "of you know its body building right yeah", "30:38", "so it's muscle size is a big factor it's", "30:40", "not the only factor but it is a big", "30:42", "factor if you look at the mr. Olympius", "30:44", "for instance in the era of Frank Zane", "30:47", "and Frank Zane is a body that probably", "30:50", "most people would look at and say", "30:51", "fucking hell that's that said that's", "30:54", "great and you know you look at me and", "30:56", "say it's too extreme but in in the era", "31:01", "of Frank Zane who was mr. Olympia was", "31:03", "Arnold right Arnold was mr. Olympia you", "31:06", "could you could argue that Frank Zane's", "31:08", "body is", "31:09", "is more aesthetic and nicer and prettier", "31:10", "than Arnold's but Arnold beets and why", "31:13", "it just was bigger more freakishly is", "31:16", "bigger and Lee Haney was eight times mr.", "31:19", "Olympia you could argue maybe Leela", "31:22", "proud or somebody like that was better", "31:25", "proportion and put together but he was", "31:27", "much smaller so you know Frank's little", "31:30", "guy you would see in a gym today like a", "31:32", "regular dude there's a lot of regular", "31:34", "duties or there's a there's a category", "31:37", "now so you got bodybuilding but you've", "31:41", "got other categories now that you didn't", "31:42", "have so you've got men's physique which", "31:44", "is more of this type of physic they're", "31:47", "looking for very aesthetic tight waist", "31:49", "everything like that and you've even got", "31:52", "classic bodybuilding now which is height", "31:54", "of a weight ratio so you know the guys", "31:57", "are not that big so you've got different", "31:58", "categories as a reaction to people not", "32:00",

didn't", "62:27", "use so much stuff getting ready for a", "62:29", "contest he was more in the offseason so", "62:31", "like a thousand milligrams of", "62:33", "testosterone a week some decade or a", "62:37", "belen maybe 500 milligrams and d-ball", "62:40", "maybe 40 50 milligrams its average and", "62:42", "growth hormone in the offseason", "62:44", "oh shit it's probably about 30 percent",

somewhere", "63:12", "yeah this there's I mean you go on the", "63:15", "internet and have a look for Dorian", "63:16", "Yates", "63:17", "stack I mean I've been on there and it's", "63:20", "I'm like first of all 50% of this stuff", "63:23", "I don't even know what it is right so I", "63:25", "don't even know what it is and the rest", "63:26", "of the stuff that I do recognize like if", "63:28",

bigger but it's not the", "63:59", "quality you know it wasn't I was known", "64:01", "for like super hard grainy quality and I", "64:04", "was felt I was losing a little bit of", "64:06", "that he

as a risk score why you", "64:17", "know that's fascinating like the quality", "64:19", "like what constitutes the quality of", "64:21", "muscle that you're looking for well I", "64:23", "think in my case I was known", "64:26", "for muscle density so you could have a", "64:28", "20 inch arm that's like Dutch good", "64:32", "volume we've have 20 inch arm that looks", "64:34", "like a fucking block of steel so how do", "64:36", "you get that look what's the difference", "64:38", "I think the difference is in in the", "64:40", "training that I trained very heavy and", "64:42", "primarily quite low reps compared to", "64:45", "body boards I was working in six to", "64:46", "eight mostly six to eight a little bit", "64:48", "higher on the legs ten to twelve but", "64:50", "everything I did was like six to eight", "64:51", "reps where most of the guys are doing 10", "64:53", "to 12 and they're relying more on", "64:55", "pumping just getting a lot of blood", "64:57", "volume into the muscle rather than", "64:59", "overloading it so I had a density and a", "65:03", "powerful look to my physique that the", "65:05", "other guys when they stood next to me", "65:06", "they didn't have that and that was just", "65:09", "from really heavy training I think so", "65:11", "you get the density of the muscle rather", "65:12", "than just pumping it Volume one how did", "65:14", "you figure out how to make that number", "65:16", "like six to eight like why not three to", "65:19", "five like what you know what I'm saying", "65:21", "like what how'd you just over over many", "65:23", "decades first of all people in the gym", "65:26", "and also studies as well most studies", "65:29", "would say for muscle growth you need to", "65:31", "keep the muscle under tension from", "65:32", "probably 40 to 60 seconds which in most", "65:35", "cases would be 8 to 12 reps so I went a", "65:38", "bit lower like 6 to 8 that worked really", "65:41", "well for me but not on legs", "65:43", "I went higher 10 or 12 on on the legs so", "65:45", "just a bit of trial and error we know", "65:49", "the lower reps will give you more", "65:52", "strength and more power without the", "65:54", "hypertrophy or the growth of the muscle", "65:56", "so that's ideal for fighters I work with", "66:00", "a few fighters in the UK and I try to", "66:02", "explain this to them and it's hard for", "66:04", "them to grasp because they think I'm in", "66:06", "the ring I'm doing a lot of you know", "66:07", "right I need endurance yeah you do but", "66:10", "you're already doing that you're already", "66:11", "doing that right so if you want to get", "66:14", "more power behind the punch but you", "66:17", "don't want to build muscle because if", "66:18", "you build muscle you put on weight then", "66:20", "you go up for weight category so", "66:21", "whatever more power you've got is going", "66:23", "to be negated by the fact that you fight", "66:25", "and heavier guys so if you could stay", "66:27", "the same weight but be more powerful and", "66:29", "stronger without building muscle size", "66:30", "that would be the key and that's", "66:33", "basically like powerlifting low reps", "66:35", "like three reps and then have a really", "66:37", "long rest", "66:39", "please foreign to MMA training yeah I'm", "66:42", "gonna do a bomb bomb bomb put it back", "66:44", "and wait for three or four minutes yeah", "66:46", "again so you get that half the power", "66:48", "behind the punch but without rest", "66:51", "but without increasing your muscle size", "66:53", "yeah because that would have you know if", "66:55", "you if you get more power behind your", "66:57", "punch but you're going up a weight class", "66:58", "like so what you know you want to stay", "67:01", "in the same weight but be stronger that", "67:03", "would be ideal for a fighter so that", "67:05", "seems counterintuitive for a lot of", "67:06", "people because they assume that bigger", "67:07", "muscles mean more power not necessarily", "67:10", "I mean bodybuilders got bigger muscles", "67:12", "and power lifters power lifters can lift", "67:14", "more weight at least for one or two reps", "67:16", "you know yeah they're training for that", "67:18", "power boom right same thing with", "67:20", "weightlifting it's a couple of reps but", "67:22", "very explosive and powerful that's hard", "67:24", "for people to understand as well like", "67:26", "yeah throw it up you know power well", "67:29", "that's the thing about kettlebell", "67:30", "competitors they're not the biggest guys", "67:32", "like they got the internal musculature", "67:35", "the core right there's a lot of the", "67:37", "lifting right yeah you know if you're", "67:40", "throwing a punch I mean who cares it got", "67:43", "huge biceps it's like the internal right", "67:46", "throw all the way up through the core", "67:48", "that's gonna give you that power so you", "67:50", "got the guy he's like Fedor Emelianenko", "67:53", "a huge fan of him I liked his fighting", "67:56", "style me as well you know I mean a guy", "67:59", "looks like you know it's got arms like", "68:02", "sticks is it looks like he's got a", "68:03", "potbelly it looks out of shape but", "68:05", "fucking hits like a baseball bat man", "68:08", "well early in his career he was bigger", "68:10", "yeah you know and he stopped training", "68:12", "weights and started training only", "68:14", "sport-specific which is it's a very", "68:17", "controversial subject because if you", "68:19", "talked to modern strength to", "68:20", "conditioning coaches they said it's", "68:21", "absolutely the wrong approach and if", "68:23", "phaidor continued to do strength and", "68:25", "conditioning along with his martial arts", "68:27", "training he probably would have been", "68:29", "able to prolong his career but who the", "68:31", "fuck knows if that's true that seems", "68:33", "like a very it's it's very hard to say", "68:36", "what would have happened but the modern", "68:39", "approach seems to be you have to", "68:43", "consider strength and conditioning as a", "68:44", "huge part of any regiment in terms of", "68:48", "like some of the elite athletes focus", "68:51", "primarily on strength", "68:53", "in camp and not really unskilled work", "68:55", "because they feel like they already know", "68:56", "how to fight like that in the brain well", "68:59", "it's all the conditioning it's all about", "69:01", "I mean as far as the you know the", "69:03", "conditioning of their emotions and their", "69:05", "ability to react is already there it's", "69:07", "just a matter of building the ultimate", "69:08", "gas tank and having the the body that", "69:11", "can perform and react as quickly and as", "69:13", "fast and recover as fast as possible but", "69:16", "I've got the guys that hit the hardest", "69:17", "that not necessarily the most muscular", "69:19", "though that's some of Omar like tyron", "69:22", "woodley who's the UFC welterweight", "69:23", "champion he's one rare guy that kind of", "69:26", "violates the normal build of", "69:29", "professional MMA athletes because he's", "69:32", "fucking jacked but he's also he's also", "69:36", "very smart in his approach whereas like", "69:39", "he's the consequences of engaging with", "69:41", "him or extreme because he has tremendous", "69:43", "power so he can pace himself more then", "69:48", "like maybe some guys can because if you", "69:50", "get in a firefight with him like one", "69:52", "shot from him puts the lights out on you", "69:54", "so he's got this ability to and he's", "69:58", "developed a very very interesting way of", "70:01", "fighting where he just paces his bursts", "70:04", "but his bursts are so terrifying like", "70:07", "when he comes at you when he can't when", "70:09", "he does sprint your way so much faster", "70:12", "than the average fighter and so much", "70:13", "stronger that

right like so", "73:18", "if somebody asked me I'm just going to", "73:19", "tell them like yeah you", "73:20", "can improve man but like you know you're", "73:22", "just gonna waste your time if you dream", "73:23", "about they mr.

"75:44", "he's still coming and kick the guy's ass", "75:45", "so you know it probably just had more", "75:48", "potential or he had a hard head or", "75:49", "something I don't know there's a lot of", "75:51", "factors involved in fighting", "75:52", "I mean his experience his ability to", "75:54", "take punishment that some of it is just", "75:56", "inherent like some people just have a",

or at", "76:10", "least the variables seem to be a lot of", "76:12", "it based on maybe I got sick of bones or", "76:14", "a shorter neck so your brain doesn't", "76:16", "rattle as much or something mark hunts a", "76:18", "perfect example that he's one of the", "76:19", "best kick boxers of all time and from", "76:21", "New Zealand yeah just a tank of a man ya", "76:24", "know 5 foot 10 265

"77:15", "brain does not want to take that kind of", "77:18", "punishment anymore and what Chuck", "77:19", "explained to me was that what it gets to", "77:23", "is the point where your brain realizes", "77:26", "that you're too tough and you're just", "77:28", "gonna absorb this punishment and it just", "77:31", "shuts itself off shuts down to protect", "77:33", "ya and that's that's how he described it", "77:36", "now obviously that's not like a", "77:37", "neuroscientist describing it there's", "77:39", "also the connective tissue that keeps", "77:41", "the brain connected and and the states", "77:44", "are that it gets looser and more tone", "77:46", "have you ever seen connective tissue", "77:48", "it's almost like like a strong version", "77:51", "of cotton candies yeah it looks like", "77:53", "it's not it's not the toughest stuff in", "77:55", "the world and it's not supposed to take", "77:58", "that many beatings like in the wild if", "78:01", "you have that many

"78:24", "skateboard 60 miles an hour you're kind", "78:27", "of fucked it's all relative right yeah", "78:28", "it's all like these study that they did", "78:30", "that just came out this week on football", "78:33", "players", "78:33", "let's show they did they did a test on a", "78:37", "hundred and eleven fighters or 111", "78:39", "football players 110 had traumatic brain", "78:42",
