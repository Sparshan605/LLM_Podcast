"02:10", "I hadn't thought about it", "02:12", "another thing I was reading about this", "02:14", "stuff and you might know more about it", "02:15", "than I do is that when you do those", "02:17",

times more whatever but", "03:13", "there's a piece about it was it was a", "03:16", "piece in The Times explaining like how", "03:19", "to make sense of now that everyone's", "03:20", "doing these tests like how to think", "03:22", "about it make sense these tests but but", "03:24", "my understanding of it is that you could", "03:29", "have a lot of ancestry that just isn't", "03:31", "captured in your genetic code in the way", "03:36", "that would be detected through the", "03:37", "testing I mean there could be ancestors", "03:39", "it for what because you're inheriting", "03:40", "half you know you're handing chromosomes", "03:42", "from each parent and somehow you could", "03:45", "have it could be an incomplete picture", "03:46", "you could have ancestors that had come", "03:49",

"04:30", "remember it was less than average and", "04:32", "you know and those things like I refined", "04:33", "about how many people do them you know", "04:36", "but it was less than average which", "04:37", "bummed me out but I'm like this Harry is", "04:40", "like a 13 year old like Norwegian girl", "04:42", "you know I've insults surprise shocking", "04:45", "didn't surprise me too much I was", "04:47", "wishing to have a little more of that", "04:48", "floating around in me it's a bizarre", "04:51", "heritage you know the idea that there", "04:53", "was a different type of human that bred", "04:56", "with Homo sapiens and that there's like", "04:59", "little bits and pieces of it floating", "05:00", "around in people yeah and people discuss", "05:03", "them people discuss let's have an", "05:06", "argument there day where they sane and", "05:07", "or tall or Neanderthal and everyone", "05:09", "grows up saying the and earth all it's", "05:10", "one of those things you're supposed to", "05:11", "switch once you realize how you're", "05:12", "supposed to do it right Neanderthal but", "05:14", "I just can't get comfortable with it I", "05:16", "go back and forth there's a lot of words", "05:18", "that like that word I know you're", "05:20", "supposed to do it but I can't get", "05:21", "comfortable with it cuz I feel like it", "05:23", "makes you sound pretentious it does it's", "05:25", "like rolling your R's and certain", "05:26", "Spanish words but we have this idea that", "05:28", "the we had this idea that Neanderthals", "05:30", "as unsuccessful right right they're", "05:35", "these brutish thugs that died out but", "05:39", "they had a six hundred thousand year run", "05:42", "yeah in Europe alone six hundred", "05:44", "thousand years longer run than Homo", "05:46", "sapiens have actually existed yeah yeah", "05:48", "so whatever I don't know that we're", "05:51", "gonna hit like I don't know that we're", "05:53", "gonna match up and have that run well", "05:56", "we'll probably have a twenty three in me", "05:58", "for whatever the fuck is after us things", "05:59", "look somebody back then fucked a human", "06:02", "like oh one of those crazy war monger", "06:05", "you can rapists thieving humans it died", "06:09", "out turns out they didn't totally die", "06:11", "out overrun with emotions and lies and", "06:14", "they someone someone of a superior race", "06:17", "infiltrated the humans and banged one of", "06:19", "them yeah it's it's it's funny to look", "06:21", "at that that understanding of those that", "06:25", "understanding of those people um an end", "06:28", "it to have the site to picture in your", "06:30", "mind's eye even though you can't picture", "06:31", "it like what was looked like when they", "06:33", "were hooking up", "06:34", "so one all right you know like", "06:38", "anatomically and kind of behaviorally", "06:40", "modern humans were hooking up with", "06:45", "Neanderthals was that with it was how is", "06:48", "it perceived by their peers I bet the", "06:50", "people that we think of as people back", "06:52", "then like you know George the animal", "06:54", "Steele is no Georgie animal Steele is a", "06:57", "very famous pro wrestler from back in", "06:59", "the day and I thought you're gonna say", "07:02", "it was a paleontologist or", "07:03", "anthropologists or a slur", "07:05", "he's arrest pro wrestler very famous guy", "07:07", "who could be a fucking caveman like", "07:10", "legitimately could be a caveman yeah see", "07:13", "if you got a good image of them now this", "07:16", "is what I think when I think of people", "07:17", "now give me a full-body one there you go", "07:21", "oh when I think of people he's hanging", "07:23", "on to some Homo sapiens Homo sapiens", "07:26", "from you know 200 thousand years ago I", "07:30", "think a George the animal Steele I think", "07:32", "there was something like that so the", "07:34", "idea of George fucking in neanderthal", "07:36", "chick not that far off I think our ideas", "07:40", "like that like dan Rather would be out", "07:42", "there banging some monkey lady I just", "07:45", "don't think I don't think that's the", "07:47", "case look at George's body i mean jesus", "07:50", "fucking christ", "07:51", "he's got the hairiest shoulders i've", "07:53", "ever seen in a man he's still alive I do", "07:56", "not know I don't believe he is I hope", "07:58", "he's not listening right now I don't", "08:00", "believe he is he's a legend legend in", "08:02", "the world of the Pro Wrestling so it's", "08:04", "gonna take more than this to hurt his", "08:05", "feelings that guy don't give a fuck yeah", "08:07", "he's a legend but uh when I was in a kid", "08:10", "in high school oh he's old so far yeah", "08:12", "he's uh well those guys they all that's", "08:16", "a hard way to make a living man so he", "08:17", "died he died at age 79 now he had a good", "08:19", "run", "08:19", "yeah that's a good run for for those", "08:22", "guys that's a fucking hard way to make a", "08:23", "living but we were talked about the the", "08:28", "idea of Neanderthals is like having a", "08:31", "confrontational hunting style no no like", "08:35", "we have because when when when", "08:38", "anthropologist look at the the skeletal", "08:41", "remains of Neanderthals they see this", "08:42", "sort of suite of this pattern of", "08:45", "injuries on them", "08:47", "and a researcher was looking at the", "08:50", "types of fractures that they have on", "08:52", "their bones and where the fractures", "08:54", "occurred and the brakes and like cracks", "08:56", "and their skulls he was looking at all", "08:59", "this and wound up working with a doctor", "09:03", "who had a lot of exposure to rodeo", "09:06", "riders bull riders and the doctor was", "09:09", "was observing the way in which that", "09:13", "suite of injuries was very familiar to", "09:15", "him from rodeo riders the types of", "09:18", "breaks and the location of breaks and", "09:20", "this guy has this idea that they had a", "09:22", "like a very confrontational hunting", "09:25", "style that they were like mixing it up", "09:28", "with big animals and another thing they", "09:30", "found is that when you're looking at", "09:33", "skeletal remains from early people you", "09:37", "still see that separation in the sexes", "09:40", "right that the male's would suffer", "09:43", "injuries", "09:43", "at with a greater prevalence than", "09:46", "females but with the Neanderthals it", "09:48", "seems like they didn't have the sort of", "09:51", "like duplicity of roles mmm so many of", "09:53", "the females the females have the same", "09:57", "prevalence of these types of injuries", "09:59", "whoa and so maybe they didn't have that", "10:02", "the they didn't share that division of", "10:04", "labor where the females as large as the", "10:07", "males yeah I don't know the answer to", "10:08", "that so we know that they had stone", "10:10", "tools right the crude stone tools yeah", "10:12", "but we don't know whether or not they", "10:14", "had anything that could launch them like", "10:16", "they didn't have did they would do we", "10:17", "know if they had Spears I don't believe", "10:19", "that they've found they had addle addle", "10:22", "right and I don't know if they were", "10:23", "hafting materials but they were doing", "10:25", "they were doing art and I think there's", "10:29", "a little bit of a debate about whether", "10:30", "they're doing representational art but", "10:32", "they were doing art they were doing they", "10:34", "were probably making jewelry and is that", "10:38", "these are all things that as as we kind", "10:40", "of like wake up to what these people", "10:42", "were really like and it paints like a", "10:44", "more complicated picture there's even", "10:46", "this theory and I don't know if this", "10:47", "held me water how long it was", "10:48", "fashionable for but you had this really", "10:50", "long history of extremely long history", "10:53", "of hundreds of thousands years of", "10:55", "Neanderthal you know occupation in", "10:57", "Europe and then it seemed to be that I", "10:59", "remember someone", "11:01", "putting forth this idea that it seemed", "11:03", "to be that there was this flourishing of", "11:06", "advancement that was contemporaneous", "11:08", "with the arrival of our own ancestors in", "11:12", "Europe as though they were being exposed", "11:16", "to or seeing art and seeing jewelry and", "11:20", "mimicking this from these new invaders", "11:23", "that were coming in but I don't know", "11:25", "where that idea sits right now I don't", "11:27", "know if it's been dispelled because of", "11:28", "other discoveries remember thing that", "11:30", "was an interesting idea that they would", "11:32", "it kind of paints this really sad", "11:34", "picture right that they would be sort of", "11:36", "in the autumn you know of their", "11:38", "existence and here's he's adorned people", "11:41", "showing up with these amazing toolkits", "11:43", "and all these abilities and kind of", "11:45", "struggling to start to catch up you know", "11:47", "it'd be like the country bumpkin you", "11:49", "know going to the big city and yeah well", "11:52", "there was also this idea I think up", "11:54", "until very recently that Neanderthals", "11:56", "were not as violent as humans as homo", "11:59", "sapiens but now there was an article", "12:01", "that was published just a couple of days", "12:03", "ago that new evidence shows that", "12:05", "Neanderthals like internee and tall", "12:07", "violence between each other it was just", "12:09", "as bad as homo sapiens yeah and find", "12:12", "that in evidence of cannibalism oh yeah", "12:14", "there was a lot of that right scraping", "12:15", "of inside the skulls indicative of tools", "12:18", "Oh ad blocker got busted they get this", "12:24", "every time with the fucking ad blocker", "12:26", "yeah was the saying humans are just as", "12:32", "violent as Neanderthals are you familiar", "12:33", "with the writer John mu alum know you'd", "12:36", "like his stuff yeah he wrote a really", "12:38", "beautiful piece about he wrote a really", "12:40", "beautiful piece about Neanderthals not", "12:41", "long ago okay I fucked it up the what", "12:44", "they're saying is that modern humans", "12:45", "were just as prone to violence as", "12:47", "Neanderthals I don't have a problem I", "12:50", "think I'm conflating this with something", "12:52", "else that I read about inter inter", "12:55", "species violence Neanderthal on", "12:57", "Neanderthal violence the other things", "13:00", "weird about them is they had bigger", "13:01", "brains in us their bigger brains and", "13:04", "they would be like five seven and weight", "13:06", "200 pounds just jacked", "13:08", "just a little gorilla thing you know", "13:10", "it'd be great to see it there's a really", "13:12", "dumb theory that was being bounced", "13:14", "around", "13:15", "a few years ago it was really hilarious", "13:16", "about how we wiped out we assumed", "13:20", "Neanderthals because you don't have a", "13:21", "soft tissue samples we assume that", "13:23", "Neanderthals looked similar in humans", "13:25", "but because of the very different shape", "13:28", "of their skull this guy had instead of", "13:31", "giving them European looking white skin", "13:33", "turn them into a gorilla turn them into", "13:36", "a giant muscle-bound gorilla that preyed", "13:39", "on people and this was like I believe", "13:42", "this guy was and actually is actually", "13:43", "was a professor and it seemed almost", "13:45", "like a goof at first you remember this", "13:47", "champion we pulled this up a few times", "13:49", "the like killer Neanderthal Theory I", "13:53", "think he called it but yeah it was he", "13:55", "had drawn this thing black like a", "13:57", "gorilla with like giant muscles all over", "14:00", "the place and these big crazy eyes and", "14:02", "that painting Neanderthals as a predator", "14:05", "of humans and that's why we wiped him", "14:07", "out yeah yeah but my limitations as see", "14:13", "I wasn't saying my limitations as an", "14:16", "anthropologist I'm certainly not an", "14:17", "anthropologist at all just a dude who's", "14:18", "interested in it but one of my", "14:20", "limitations is I'll hear theories", "14:23", "floated okay and I don't follow them", "14:26", "long enough to see which ones have any", "14:28", "traction right I'll just read about them", "14:31", "and and I don't I don't take it as", "14:33", "gospel but I'll read about it and I'll", "14:36", "be like that's interesting and it was", "14:37", "sort of like shaped my understanding of", "14:38", "it but then I don't keep track of it", "14:40", "like I try to really follow the story of", "14:43", "like the peopling of the Americas so", "14:44", "when it comes to the human history of", "14:47", "the Western Hemisphere I sort of follow", "14:50", "and like ideas will get floated and I'll", "14:52", "track the idea to see where it lands in", "14:54", "terms of scholarly consensus but another", "14:56", "stuff like with with Neanderthals I'm", "14:58", "always a sucker for a Neanderthal story", "14:59", "but I don't track what ideas that float", "15:03", "up are just very quickly denounced as", "15:05", "being complete rubbish hmm yeah it's a", "15:08", "weird one you know it's a it's it takes", "15:10", "time to it takes time to follow this", "15:13", "stuff go go to that other picture that's", "15:15", "what it is them them and and us yeah but", "15:19", "look at him as some of his images look", "15:21", "at that image that he has on the cover", "15:22", "of the book like those the idea there's", "15:25", "some way better ones there's some way", "15:27", "better images what they drew", "15:28", "of full-body ones they had is it in the", "15:33", "article this was a link to the special", "15:36", "website from a different article just go", "15:38", "go to that and then go to images because", "15:42", "there was some really bizarre fucking", "15:44", "yeah there is upper left-hand corner", "15:46", "this is what this guy yeah laughing", "15:49", "whatever he's got going on that thing is", "15:51", "not making art you know think so no he's", "15:56", "making meat come on yeah yeah it's", "16:01", "pretty preposterous but near toasting", "16:05", "that fangs like that no did they know", "16:07", "but it's out he's he morphing and", "16:09", "neanderthal into a gorilla's that was", "16:11", "trying to do down here oh that's a ha", "16:13", "okay monkey gorilla and the end at all", "16:15", "but yeah but the like oh it's got it", "16:18", "snarling with its fucking vegetable", "16:20", "eatin teeth

"49:18", "they're very much modern you know very", "49:20", "modern but you can still like glimpse it", "49:22", "more you don't I don't think you really", "49:24", "get that as much you don't get that as", "49:28", "much here you know hunting is ancestral", "49:32", "right there's this kind of continuation", "49:34", "that goes on but when Europeans came", "49:38", "here when Europeans came to the new", "49:40", "world they weren't coming in as hunters", "49:44", "right even to go look like Daniel", "49:47", "Boone's family Daniel Boone's family", "49:50", "came from England they didn't

doesn't have that like", "50:13", "that deep deep thread they'd find with", "50:17", "indigenous communities where there's", "50:18", "this continuation that's going on for", "50:22", "forever unbroken but on this continent", "50:24", "unbroken for whatever 15 16 whatever the", "50:26", "fashionable number is thousands of years", "50:28", "right and so it's like our understanding", "50:31", "is just different because our like my", "50:34", "ancestors came here and like got into it", "50:37", "it wasn't it wasn't a cultural", "50:39", "continuation for them and then when you", "50:41",

it's very particular to us", "52:38", "like other people aren't really", "52:41", "perceiving it that way like they don't", "52:43", "use wild game and recipes they have like", "52:45", "oh there's like here's how you cook this", "52:46", "and we don't really deviate from cooking", "52:50", "this way or it's like fish on a rack", "52:52", "over to fire or fish in the pot of water", "52:54", "and

the", "101:18", "ballot you know would you like to", "101:20", "reintroduce mountain lion hunting people", "101:22", "would go crazy like why would you do", "101:23", "that mountain lions are

know", "130:33", "when we look at when a state met like", "130:36", "looks at like what's a what what what's", "130:39", "a turkey harvest that our state could", "130:41", "support they break the state up into a", "130:43", "bunch of different units they look at", "130:44", "population trends and they determine", "130:46", "like how many turkey can we afford to", "130:47", "harvest without

part", "131:20", "what I am is I'm like having a", "131:21", "conversation with people who live this", "131:23", "lifestyle right like those are people", "131:26", "that I relate to I want to

the hope that", "132:04", "people will like say read this book and", "132:09", "then be like man I want to participate", "132:11", "in this lifestyle that could mean as", "132:14", "much as them

the better it winds", "133:00", "up being for American wildlife I agree", "133:03", "but the idea is that everyone can't do", "133:07", "it so the idea that your", "133:10", "that this is how you

saying you dog I'm saying this", "133:21", "is one of the arguments that people make", "133:22", "if you say that you know hey I hunt for", "133:25", "my meat this is how I acquire me you", "133:28",

got involved it's not it's", "133:37", "not a solution for the entire population", "133:39", "you can say well that's good the entire", "133:41", "population is not gonna do it anyway but", "133:43",

"133:56", "the solution that we're doing right now", "133:57", "unless they come up with some sort of a", "133:59", "I mean they're lab-created meat or", "134:01", "whatever the fuck they're gonna come up", "134:03", "with next which they are do your lips", "134:05", "are curling as the involuntary I said", "134:10", "I'm pretty happy with I'm pretty happy", "134:14", "with my diet right now
