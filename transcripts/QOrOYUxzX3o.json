knew", "12:36", "much about and", "12:37", "at the bottom you know we were", "12:39", "struggling to get it made and there was", "12:41", "a", "12:41", "weather problems there was all kinds of", "12:46", "logistical problems but we'd been", "12:47", "through hell on salvador as i described", "12:49", "in the book in mexico so we", "12:51", "were a unit by this time we we got used", "12:53",

"13:20", "but uh the uh the resistance to it at", "13:23", "the very end with the mgm was supposed", "13:25", "to be the distributor", "13:27", "and henry kissinger was on the board of", "13:29",

whether", "13:39", "they went to that board i don't know but", "13:40", "that's what the story they cover their", "13:42", "ass by telling me we can't make this", "13:43", "movie we can't distribute this movie", "13:45", "because", "13:45", "the board would be against it now", "13:47", "sometimes they they tell you that", "13:49", "without checking", "13:50", "but in this case i don't know so as a", "13:53", "result", "13:54", "the film fell apart again this was a", "13:56", "heartbreak did you ever", "13:57", "think like maybe i can move it a little", "13:58", "bit or change it a little bit or", "14:00", "would you just spend it the pentagon", "14:02", "said to me uh forget it we're not going", "14:03", "to help you at all", "14:04", "this thing is completely distorted they", "14:07", "were", "14:08", "upset as hell about the fragging i mean", "14:10", "that's to say really you know what", "14:11", "fragging is yeah", "14:12", "yeah there was a lot of that towards the", "14:14", "end i mean it started in 67", "14:17", "8 but there was more and more discontent", "14:19", "when", "14:21", "lyndon johnson pulled out of the", "14:22", "presidency in march of 68.", "14:25", "that was a big moment i think all the", "14:27", "soldiers everyone kind of knew", "14:28", "that this thing was not going to work", "14:30", "out and who wanted to be the last guy to", "14:32", "get killed in vietnam", "14:33", "right and so i think 69 70 were more and", "14:36", "more fractions", "14:38", "more fraction fractious and there was", "14:41", "more and more incidents at one point", "14:42", "there was a pentagon document that came", "14:44", "out", "14:45", "i've seen it that said this situation in", "14:48", "in the army is getting so poor so bad", "14:50", "the morale is so low", "14:52", "that it's it resembles is beginning to", "14:54", "resemble the french mutinies in 1917", "14:57", "in the world war one that was a big", "15:00", "concern of the pentagon", "15:01", "they knew the thing was not going to", "15:04", "work it was cracking from within", "15:06", "so we we gave more and more let's say", "15:10", "more and more uh credit to the", "15:12", "vietnamese

"46:38", "wait till you see the documentary", "46:40", "because we we go we i think we", "46:42", "pretty much prove that there's no chain", "46:43", "of evidence on on the rifle either", "46:46", "no
