to", "51:53", "as Australian football hmm I think I", "51:56", "think yeah it's a little more like fluid", "51:58", "like the game doesn't stop as much as", "52:00", "less stoppages they kind of just keep", "52:01", "going okay it says it's a little more", "52:03", "fluid where players can pretty much run", "52:05", "around where they choose they still have", "52:07", "a specific end side goal to
