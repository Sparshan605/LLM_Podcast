says she doesn't so", "15:12", "yeah I think and then she 2001 says", "15:17", "seventh having seven personalities as", "15:18", "tough her saying it so yeah well here's", "15:21", "the thing about Roseanne I mean you know", "15:23", "I'm saying this for the tenth time I", "15:25", "guess she was hit by a car when she's 15", "15:28", "and", "15:28", "she was put in a mental institute for",
