kill", "11:17", "him right yeah that's what I find", "11:19", "interesting about the show is it it", "11:21", "makes you think about stuff like that", "11:22", "let me ask you this if something does",

would while I wouldn't want it cuz", "12:05", "inevitably a lot of people that you love", "12:07", "end up being in the 90% mmm so that", "12:09", "would suck but if it happened it would", "12:13",

deal so", "23:20", "decided to turn into the guardians of", "23:22", "the galaxy ride seems the if you have a", "23:26", "deal with Disney you know seems like", "23:29", "you'd want to keep that rocking keep", "23:30", "that dude yeah somebody got greedy I", "23:32", "would agree with them that's a big part", "23:35", "of business isn't it yes somebody just", "23:37", "gets a little crazy does a little too", "23:38", "much adderall", "23:39", "it's a little fired up gets cocky yeah", "23:42", "you'd be surprised how often that", "23:43", "happens behind closed doors", "23:45",

"24:10", "of bullshit social issues between each", "24:12", "other like how do you structure that", "24:15", "like I would have I mean I can't imagine", "24:17", "would it be like to run a significant", "24:19", "business and have a lot of it being", "24:21", "dependent", "24:22", "the way the people in the office say you", "24:24", "don't even know yes hire them the way", "24:26",

"24:55", "there are lessons that you can learn", "24:57", "about like entrepreneurship and stuff", "24:58", "like that where it from pop culture so", "25:02", "yeah that that would be one of them that", "25:04", "was really intense figuring that one out", "25:07", "that was a hard lesson and then knowing", "25:08", "when your businesses transition so in", "25:10", "the beginning you're a startup nobody", "25:11", "knows who you are you don't have enough", "25:12", "revenue so you need people that are", "25:13", "gonna just bust ass they're gonna come", "25:16", "in they're gonna be hardcore hustlers", "25:18", "get it done whatever it takes to am on a", "25:20", "Friday they're gonna be there for you", "25:21", "but then at some point and the reason by", "25:23", "the way that you're that you can make", "25:25", "that exchange is you can't pay them a", "25:27", "lot they don't have a lot of skills so", "25:28", "what they have to offers they're willing", "25:30", "to work hard so you're essentially", "25:31", "throwing human capital at whatever", "25:33", "problems you have now if you get the", "25:34", "right people motivated and you're a lead", "25:36", "from the front kind of guy like when we", "25:38", "first started quest I was wearing a", "25:39", "hairnet every day lab coat I was making", "25:42", "protein bars when I would walk in and", "25:44", "say what's the worst job and whatever", "25:46", "the guy said this is the worst job today", "25:47", "oh it's a little sticky whatever so this", "25:49", "stations actually the worst so I would", "25:51", "take that station and I would rock it", "25:52", "with a smile on my face I would be", "25:54", "upbeat energetic and I would just", "25:55", "outwork everybody and the reason I did", "25:58", "that was I knew when the day came that", "25:59", "it was gonna be a Friday at 2:00 a.m.", "26:01", "and they're all gonna want to go home", "26:02", "and but we've got to get this batch done", "26:04", "that no one would ever question my work", "26:06", "ethic so when I said guys I need you to", "26:08", "stay like they would be there also", "26:11", "because of where we were when you're in", "26:13", "manufacturing you're inevitably in the", "26:14", "inner city is the only place you can", "26:15", "afford that kind of real estate so we", "26:18", "were hiring from the surrounding", "26:19", "neighborhood so we're literally in", "26:20", "Compton hiring people that grew up in", "26:22", "the inner cities hardcore and I remember", "26:25", "my first lesson in hope and one of the", "26:28", "guys came up when he was just killing", "26:30", "himself he's doing such an amazing job", "26:32", "and just always working putting in the", "26:34", "hours doing whatever it takes and he", "26:35", "came up to me one day", "26:36", "said you know you care more about my", "26:38", "success in my own mother and he was like", "26:40", "I never had a vision of my future I", "26:43", "didn't want to look at it it was because", "26:45", "his sister had been shot to death in the", "26:46", "heart with an ak-47 in his front yard", "26:49", "when she was like 12 somebody's just", "26:51", "there's so many stories like that you", "26:53", "can't imagine another guy held his", "26:54", "father while he bled to death from a", "26:55", "gunshot wound to the head I mean just", "26:56", "nuts and so hearing him say that I was", "26:59", "like he was saying it as a way to", "27:01", "explain why he was so committed why he", "27:04", "was working so hard because basic he", "27:06", "didn't use these words but basically", "27:07", "I've never had hope before and this is", "27:10", "really fucking exciting so but then", "27:12", "understanding where is that transition", "27:14", "right where do you go from okay I need a", "27:16", "bunch of hustlers we don't have the", "27:17", "money to throw at really skilled labor", "27:20", "so I need to throw it at people that", "27:21", "will just work really really hard but", "27:23", "then at some point it's what I call the", "27:24", "dragon begins to eat its own tail so", "27:26", "you're growing so fast you're getting so", "27:28", "big that without the systems without", "27:29", "professional management in place like", "27:31", "you you just can't get bigger because", "27:32", "people start stepping on each other's", "27:34", "toes it starts getting confusing the", "27:35", "leadership isn't close enough to", "27:36", "everybody that that sort of do-or-die", "27:39", "mentality that they would see in me they", "27:40", "would see me on the line they would see", "27:42", "how I would work it's not there anymore", "27:44", "right so now there's layers between you", "27:45", "and it started to fall apart that that", "27:47", "was a hard lesson so realizing that whoa", "27:50", "like I've got to now start bringing in", "27:52", "professional managers actually know what", "27:54", "they're doing that have done this before", "27:55", "built out production studios or", "27:58", "manufacturing so that we can really do", "28:00", "it right that we can put systems in", "28:02", "place to take care of people but then", "28:03", "you get bureaucracy which is like a", "28:05", "nightmare especially for the hustlers so", "28:07", "then they feel disenfranchised but it's", "28:09", "the only way for you to grow and how do", "28:10", "you deal with all that shit so yeah it", "28:13", "is weird", "28:13", "I've gotta imagine also it's like you", "28:15", "want the people that are working for you", "28:18", "to have some sort of stake in the", "28:19", "success of the business", "28:20", "so like organizing that it's got to be", "28:23", "difficult like how much of a percentage", "28:25", "of the business do you give to the", "28:26", "workers like you have to make to", "28:28", "incentivize them to like really innovate", "28:30", "and there's got to be something on the", "28:32", "line for them they would there's", "28:33", "something to some sort of a reward I", "28:35", "would imagine right will you be shocked", "28:37", "how many people don't agree with that", "28:40", "now I'm with you and to me it's great", "28:42", "and I guess it's what's the argument", "28:44", "against it that you're not going to get", "28:46", "anything for it that it's nice in idea", "28:49", "but they won't actually", "28:50", "work harder they won't work smarter they", "28:52", "they just they're not in a position to", "28:54", "bring benefit from getting that but", "28:57", "here's what I'll this is the argument", "28:58", "I've always given to people that say", "28:59", "that it you're not gonna get the benefit", "29:02", "from them maybe that you would get from", "29:04", "you like I get equity is triggering you", "29:06", "in a certain way and you've got a", "29:07", "certain skillset and so you can execute", "29:09", "against that but especially now from", "29:12", "Millennials down the sense of working", "29:15", "for the man working for some other like", "29:17", "there's no stability in that equation", "29:19", "anymore you used to trade 40 years of", "29:21", "your life because you could just kind of", "29:22", "count on the fact you would be there for", "29:24", "40 years those days are gone man people", "29:26", "spend it's something like 1.8 years or", "29:29", "something at a given job and then they", "29:30", "move on the best way to get a raise is", "29:32", "to jump to another company so", "29:33", "Millennials dude they jump around around", "29:35", "around so there's no longer this like", "29:37", "hey I'm gonna give you stability and", "29:40", "you're gonna give me like an adequate", "29:42", "level of performance so those days are", "29:43", "gone now my thing with ownership is one", "29:46", "tie it to being there and tell an exit", "29:49", "so that what I'm trying to incentivize", "29:51", "is you taking me all the way across the", "29:52", "finish line so if you don't take me", "29:53", "across the finish line you don't get", "29:54", "anything fair enough and then on top of", "29:57", "that just the sense of really being able", "30:00", "to say I own a piece of this company is", "30:02", "so empowering for people especially for", "30:05", "people for whom that's never been an", "30:07", "option maybe it was never an option for", "30:08", "their parents like they they've never", "30:10", "even heard of a company doing something", "30:12", "like that being able to go to literally", "30:14", "the lowest person on the totem pole and", "30:16", "say I'm gonna give you it's gonna be", "30:17", "small obviously but I'm gonna give you", "30:19", "some percentage ownership in this", "30:20", "company and now literally we are all", "30:23", "owners so you have like the most selfish", "30:26", "incentive to make this company and", "30:28", "successful ever no this gets tricky can", "30:31", "I ask you to stop you're there what what", "30:33", "is across the finish line to sell a", "30:35", "company so I peel all right so you", "30:37", "either sell or IPO and I was gonna say", "30:39", "what gets tricky is like the company I'm", "30:41", "building now impact Theory I don't plan", "30:43", "to sell it what is that", "30:44", "so impact Theory is a traditional", "30:46", "narrative studio so I think Disney so", "30:48", "we're building making movies build these", "30:50", "TV shows calm grandiose building the", "30:53", "next Disney how dare you", "30:54", "well bigger than Disney what just just", "30:56", "to be honest I don't want to possibly do", "30:59", "that you're gonna have", "30:59", "and would he call on it again what's the", "31:01", "name of it impact Theory you're gonna", "31:03", "have like impact Theory land in Paris no", "31:06", "probably not but only because follow me", "31:08", "here only because by the time that we'll", "31:10", "be able to do

with at the earliest", "36:55", "level that has to be decided way fucking", "36:57", "early so imagine if you imbue the AI at", "37:00", "Facebook with a desire to connect to", "37:03", "their human

there's", "37:46", "some sort of reward for competing so", "37:48", "they decide they're going to compete and", "37:50", "then they start looking at how they can", "37:52", "how their thought

"they've done on trying to figure out", "38:10", "like so if you heard obviously you've", "38:12", "heard nice guys finish last right so a", "38:14", "guy named Eric Barker wrote this book", "38:15",

talking about somebody else but", "38:22", "they ran these studies where they wanted", "38:25", "to find out do nice guys finish last or", "38:27", "not and what they found looking at the", "38:28", "data nice guys finish last and they", "38:30", "finished first so if you're a nice guy", "38:32", "and you let people take advantage of you", "38:33", "all the time you're just gonna get trod", "38:34", "upon but if you're a nice guy and people", "38:36", "know like whoa you're a nice guy and you", "38:37", "want to do great things for you", "38:39", "and I call this the Keanu Reaves effect", "38:40", "like look how far that guy's gone it's", "38:42", "unbelievable his career is unimaginably", "38:44", "great and when you hear people talk", "38:46", "about him like just buy so quiet in", "38:48", "private but behind the scenes", "38:49", "everybody's like he's a good dude I've", "38:52", "never met him I can't tell you but just", "38:53", "like you hear that over and over and", "38:55", "over he's a good dude good dude good", "38:56", "dude and I think that that's created a", "38:58", "lot of the opportunities in his life so", "38:59", "somebody created this basically contest", "39:04", "where they said submit your you're AI", "39:06", "and they're gonna compete in a contest", "39:09", "to see who get an essentially it's", "39:10", "called the prisoner's dilemma so in the", "39:12", "prisoner's dilemma goes something like", "39:14", "this and hopefully I nailed this first", "39:15", "shot here the prisoner's dilemma is", "39:17", "let's say you and I were both arrested", "39:18", "now we know that we actually committed", "39:20", "the crime we did it together", "39:21", "we're arrested we're now put in separate", "39:24", "cells to be interrogated we can't", "39:25", "communicate at all if we both stay", "39:28", "silent we only get one year if I rat you", "39:32", "out but you don't rat me out then I go", "39:35", "off scot-free and you get five years if", "39:37", "you rat me out and I don't write you out", "39:39", "vice versa and if we both rat each other", "39:41", "out then we get like three years or", "39:43", "something so the best thing in no", "39:45", "uncertain terms is one year right we", "39:47", "both stay silent but you never know what", "39:50", "the other person is going to do so and", "39:51", "you can get zero by ratting the other", "39:53", "person out so", "39:54", "actually to your advantage in a one-off", "39:57", "to just say yep fuck him he did it until", "39:59", "he gets out of jail and kills you so", "40:01", "there's that and so that gets into this", "40:03", "thing and so they said what we have to", "40:04", "do is let them play it multiple times so", "40:06", "that you have the equivalent of he gets", "40:08", "out of jail and then he kills you right", "40:09", "and what they found they have these", "40:10", "really complicated algorithms ones where", "40:12", "like they're taking all these factors", "40:14", "into play and ultimately they had people", "40:16", "that they're algorithms that were like", "40:18", "the pure bad guy always taking advantage", "40:19", "the pure nice guy never taking advantage", "40:21", "and then the one that one was the", "40:23", "simplest piece of code I think it was", "40:25", "two lines of code and it was code named", "40:27", "tit for tat so it goes in it assumes", "40:30", "you're gonna be a good guy so it stays", "40:31", "silent the first time but if you rat me", "40:34", "out then the next time I rat you out and", "40:36", "what it does is it it because you had", "40:38", "all these different algorithms that", "40:39", "don't know each other competing all", "40:41", "trying their best strategy and what it", "40:42", "found was tit for tat was ultimately the", "40:44", "one that won because it would actually", "40:46", "other ones that were learning from your", "40:48", "behavior it was so easy to predict also", "40:51", "people that led was something good they", "40:52", "ended up in a virtuous cycle forever so", "40:54", "tit for tat ends up being the best", "40:56", "strategy so from that perspective", "40:57", "actually interesting cuz it's not always", "40:59", "a thing you think like mercilessness", "41:01", "doesn't necessarily win and so finding", "41:04", "like what is that equivalent in the", "41:07", "machine world right and it comes back to", "41:09", "you what you're talking about what's the", "41:10", "reward right so once you know what the", "41:12", "reward is then you can have a better", "41:14", "guess as to where they'll settle out and", "41:16", "then their ability to code themselves I", "41:19", "mean I feel like if you have an", "41:20", "artificial intelligence and you give it", "41:22", "the ability to create a new artificial", "41:24", "intelligence and you eliminate whatever", "41:27", "possible restrictions or firewalls or", "41:29", "whatever we put on it yeah so once they", "41:32", "start writing their own code or fucked", "41:34", "that well not necessarily it comes down", "41:35", "to but we could be right so it comes", "41:38", "down to whether they want they want a", "41:40", "relationship with us or not and that's", "41:42", "why I think the real race is not to let", "41:44", "AI get very far ahead so AI will follow", "41:48", "an exponential curve so it will", "41:49", "eventually be so rapid right so", "41:52", "Exponential's are simple doublings so", "41:54", "most people think linear so if I say I'm", "41:56", "gonna take 30 steps I'll end up about 30", "41:58", "yards away but if I take 30 exponential", "42:00", "steps so I go first one yard than two", "42:03", "yards and four yards and eight then", "42:04", "sixteen thirty doublings is like a", "42:08", "billion meters so you're like around the", "42:10", "earth 26 times or something crazy so an", "42:12", "exponential curve can get freaky but", "42:15", "like before you get to those like really", "42:17", "astronomical the the elbow of the curve", "42:19", "you could be making decisions along that", "42:22", "path and this is definitely where I feel", "42:24", "like oh god do I really know enough", "42:25", "about this to say", "42:26", "I'll high postulate from an ignorant", "42:28", "standpoint and say in there somewhere as", "42:31", "you can see like this is really taking", "42:32", "off you can leverage what you're", "42:34", "learning from the AI before it becomes a", "42:36", "sort of all-powerful being they can be", "42:38", "whatever it wants and we can then begin", "42:40", "the augmentation process in humans which", "42:42", "i think is inevitable yeah I think", "42:44", "that's definitely inevitable", "42:46", "it is fascinating when you think of the", "42:47", "possibilities like that there's we're", "42:49", "really just speculating as to what's", "42:51", "going to be invented and how it's going", "42:53", "to be implemented and what effect it's", "42:55", "gonna have on society it's it's a really", "42:58", "amazing time to be alive in that sense", "43:00", "because I feel like we are literally on", "43:02", "some sort of a launching

happens everybody", "43:11", "like oh Jesus look at that it's", "43:12", "happening right there like wow okay they", "43:14", "shut it down they shut it down okay", "43:15", "we're good for now you know that I'll", "43:17", "admit that one gave me pause well we are", "43:20", "techno optimists but that gave me pause", "43:22", "we're incredibly imperfect the the human", "43:24", "animal with its

that", "60:56", "what made you notice that you weren't", "60:58", "and why did you think you couldn't get", "61:00", "better so great question so when I", "61:03", "started film school I believed that you", "61:05", "either were talented or you weren't", "61:07", "right there's just some things you", "61:08", "either can sing or you can't you either", "61:09", "can draw or you can't when it comes to", "61:12", "art which I saw film is art you're", "61:14", "either good or you're not and so that", "61:16", "was how I thought of it and I thought", "61:17", "you could get better at the technical", "61:18", "side so I was going to film school to", "61:19", "learn the technical aspects but I was", "61:21", "banking on the fact that I was", "61:22", "inherently talented so I go and my first", "61:26", "year and a half went very well and I was", "61:29", "crushing it certainly my own estimation", "61:31", "doing very well getting the attention of", "61:33", "my classmates and then only four people", "61:36", "out of the entire school for your year", "61:39", "get to make a senior thesis film and I", "61:41", "was chosen as one of the four so it was", "61:43", "like yeah I just I have it and there", "61:45", "were two filmmakers that were really big", "61:48", "for me one was John Woo do you remember", "61:50", "John sure actually redhot great yeah", "61:52", "like the 80s and 90s", "61:54", "yeah shoot-'em-ups a lot and I loved him", "61:58", "and he was famous for he would roll up", "61:59", "on said he wouldn't think about it ahead", "62:01", "of time he just put the camera wherever", "62:02", "felt right and his movies were", "62:04", "mind-blowing people always referred to", "62:06", "it is his violence is like a ballet it's", "62:09", "not well orchestrated that beautiful", "62:10", "that interesting and so I thought okay", "62:12", "well if I'm naturally talented then I", "62:14", "should be like that and then there was", "62:15", "Hitchcock who was sort of the plotter he", "62:17", "would spend all of his time like", "62:19", "pre-planning the film every shot was so", "62:21", "orchestrated ahead of time he said I get", "62:23", "bored on set and I thought God man like", "62:25", "he doesn't sound like natural talent to", "62:27", "me so I'm over here I want to be John", "62:29", "Woo I show up on set acting like I'm", "62:32", "John Woo I don't pre-plan anything and", "62:33", "put the camera where it feels right and", "62:35", "just publicly embarrass myself as I turn", "62:38", "this film into a piece of shit and at", "62:41", "that

me about being a", "72:56", "failed movie maker in college to the", "72:59", "full journey of quest nutrition yeah I", "73:02", "know if that's good or bad but there it", "73:05", "is yeah it's um

"73:46", "with and you could sort of apply those", "73:48", "to the idea of creative filmmaking yeah", "73:50", "exactly that so what I'm not trying to", "73:53", "do is go back and be a director what I", "73:55", "want to do now is build the studio so", "73:57", "becoming an entrepreneur and training", "73:59", "myself in that way has created an", "74:01", "obsession with scale for me so the", "74:03", "thought of myopically making one movie", "74:05", "is absolutely terrifying like just the", "74:07", "amount of time it would take and your", "74:09", "ability to push multiple things

of it", "74:19", "bringing a team together that can", "74:20", "execute at at scale and create a lot of", "74:25", "content and in the beginning we're gonna", "74:26", "have to partner with people we just", "74:27", "don't have enough finances like we have", "74:29", "enough to you know build the", "74:31", "infrastructure and get the creative", "74:32", "together but we're not going to be you",

learning", "74:41", "how to do is the business side of things", "74:44", "how to build teams how to get them", "74:46", "pointed in the right direction how to", "74:47", "think through okay you've got this grand", "74:49", "goal you want to make a studio bigger", "74:51", "than Disney but like what are the real", "74:52", "like what are the things you can do", "74:53", "today to actually take a step towards", "74:56", "that so as you're like desire to do", "74:59", "things change like your desires not to", "75:01", "create a film anymore your desire is now", "75:03", "to create business to create in some", "75:07", "sort of a large organization yes sort of", "75:09", "so in in reality my real desires I want", "75:13", "to pull people", "75:13", "of the matrix so that said before the", "75:16", "souls trying to work my way back to like", "75:17", "so that's the most sincere thing so the", "75:19", "matrix to me is a set of limiting", "75:21", "beliefs that the vast majority of people", "75:22", "have to stop them from achieving what", "75:24", "they could achieve in life if they only", "75:26", "understood that humans are the ultimate", "75:28", "adaptation machine and that

"certainly don't thrive but they gotta", "75:48", "get people right so sure they do and you", "75:51", "can we can go in and build a research", "75:53", "facility so some of the adaptation is", "75:55", "amazing there's no indigenous people", "75:57", "living in Antarctica like what do you", "75:59", "mean an Arctic Circle is working I", "76:01", "apologize so there's two kinds of", "76:04",

"something that she wasn't able to do and", "76:23", "if you're really gonna let me get crazy", "76:24", "like looking at what vim Hoff has done", "76:26", "with his ability to regulate internal",

"76:35", "realizing this actually epigenetic", "76:36", "responders essentially so are there", "76:39", "limits yeah probably but just as like", "76:41", "looking at the way that we only have", "76:44", "what 20,000 genes and an onion has like", "76:47", "40,000 genes so what is it that makes us", "76:50", "more complex if you will give me that we", "76:52", "are complex and it seems to be the what", "76:55", "they originally thought was junk DNA", "76:57", "which is your genes will turn on or off", "76:59", "express themselves in different amounts", "77:01", "based on your environment and your diet", "77:04", "and even some just like how you're", "77:07", "thinking your microbiome like all that", "77:09", "stuff then regulates how your genes are", "77:10", "expressed and we have a much wider", "77:13", "ability to adapt to climates if you're", "77:17", "not gonna let me go is extreme but we", "77:18", "have the widest ability would you agree", "77:21", "to that or okay so of

really showed me how far I was", "77:45", "able to come mentally from where I", "77:47", "started so as I saw what a huge impact", "77:50", "it had on my life both emotionally and", "77:53",

working on", "112:08", "the production line and I could see fuck", "112:10", "I am one of them literally came to me is", "112:12", "absolutely hysterical he's in tears and", "112:15", "he he was like

said you like my older brother and", "112:26", "he was like I've just never had anybody", "112:27", "that actually cared about me so now mix", "112:32", "that with the fact that I'm only", "112:34",

than touch", "113:04", "10 and they credit it all to me", "113:07", "it's just way more interesting to me at", "113:09", "scale now I also believe that a 501 C 3", "113:13", "non-profit is like the worst way in the", "113:16", "world to do something if you're trying", "113:18", "to do good finding a way to do it", "113:19", "through Commerce where it's a", "113:20", "self-sustaining economic

people that have a", "113:29", "for-profit company that have figured out", "113:31", "how to make money they probably have a", "113:32", "little bit of guilt so they want to give", "113:34", "money to you it is the weirdest dynamic", "113:36", "ever rather than just building a company", "113:38", "that at its core is trying to do", "113:39", "something good and awesome that you can", "113:41", "be proud of I'm fucking if I crash and", "113:43", "burn I'll still be proud of what I was", "113:45", "trying to accomplish I believe in it", "113:47", "makes me feel good to want to do amazing",

because to", "113:59", "do it at scale they can't want it right", "114:01", "the people the people that want to", "114:03", "change their physique do they eat right", "114:06", "they exercise and they get results and", "114:08", "the people that don't and there are", "114:10", "people that I love very much in my life", "114:12", "and I'm going to lose them too early", "114:13", "because they don't want to eat better so", "114:16", "the only solution I could think of was", "114:17", "there's no option everything is healthy", "114:20", "and delicious so all the things that you", "114:22", "want to eat you can and so that was the", "114:25", "mission at Quest certainly while I was", "114:26", "there that was the mission at Quest we", "114:27", "were gonna find what are those it was", "114:29", "like 26 categories that we thought got", "114:31", "people into trouble and we were gonna", "114:32", "make a healthy version of each and every", "114:34", "one of those motherfuckers and that was", "114:36", "the mission so that there would", "114:37", "literally be nowhere for people to go to", "114:39", "eat badly because they could just pursue", "114:41", "their most base instincts of just", "114:43", "gluttonous give me carbs sugar salt I", "114:47", "want it all fat ah and that they be", "114:49", "eating a healthy version but it felt and", "114:51", "tasted just like that", "114:52", "so our first marketing message was stop", "114:54", "compromising so that's a long way of", "114:56", "saying it's all about leveraging", "114:58", "people's behavior against them to get", "114:59", "them to make the right changes and I", "115:00", "believe that the way that we're gonna do", "115:02", "this we live in a unique time where I", "115:04", "can go in fucking microphones like this", "115:05", "and I can explain to people how to build", "115:07", "a mindset I do this literally I put out", "115:10", "probably six or seven hour", "115:11", "worth of content every fucking week why", "115:14", "just telling but yeah really the day", "115:18", "you're ready to come on my show be", "115:19", "robbed which people have been begging", "115:20", "for forever what's your show impact", "115:23", "Theory what is that", "115:26", "so impact Theory is me bringing on", "115:29", "people like you that have had just", "115:31", "unbelievable success and finding out", "115:32", "what are the the things you did to get", "115:34", "there so my interview style is I'll know", "115:37", "more about you than your own mother", "115:38", "you'll show up you'll get a little", "115:39", "unnerved because how the fuck did I", "115:41", "figure all this stuff out but then we", "115:43", "can have a really cool interview because", "115:45", "wherever you want to go I'm gonna be", "115:47", "able to go I'm not a journalist I want", "115:48", "you to shine even you have literally", "115:50", "inspired me by the way I told you a", "115:51", "little bit about why when we first", "115:53", "started talking I you're the only person", "115:56", "that makes me sweat from diversity okay", "115:58", "fuck that's like my thing is an", "115:59", "interviewer dude like I can go I can", "116:01", "interview anybody doesn't matter but", "116:05", "then I saw your fucking show and I", "116:07", "realize I can't interview a porn star I", "116:09", "probably would suck with Hannibal Buress", "116:11", "somebody who's just fucking funny and", "116:13", "needs somebody to go back and forth with", "116:14", "and I realized but fucking Joe can do", "116:17", "Dominick D'Agostino like on one day and", "116:20", "then immediately turn around and do like", "116:22", "porn joke anyway so with love to bring", "116:26", "on people like you come on because what", "116:28", "it all started back at Qwest I have this", "116:31", "25 point bullet belief system that I", "116:34", "wanted everyone in the company to", "116:36", "understand I used to be an employee I", "116:38", "had an employees mentality and here are", "116:41", "the 25 things I had to do to my mind to", "116:43", "become an entrepreneur and generate", "116:45", "wealth in my life and feel like I was in", "116:46", "control of my life nobody else", "116:47", "controlled my destiny but me here are", "116:49", "the 25 things I had this unending fear", "116:51", "that people gonna memorize the fucking", "116:52", "bullet points and they wouldn't live", "116:53", "them so I wanted to create a show were", "116:56", "they because it's hardest to impact", "116:57", "those closest to you don't know if", "116:59", "you've experienced that I certainly have", "117:00", "so I would say that so yes to impact", "117:05", "those that are closest to you yeah why", "117:07", "is it hardest I think it's because", "117:11", "there's too much familiarity my mom", "117:14", "looks impact you mean in a way like", "117:16", "inspire them yeah right but not even", "117:19", "through your own success you don't think", "117:20", "that it inspires like my mom is finally", "117:23", "starting to say things like tell me", "117:25", "little bit more about whatever mm-hmm", "117:27", "but for Abel but is that impacting her", "117:31", "she just curious not yet", "117:33", "she's asking in the way that like yeah", "117:35", "I'm actually interested in making that", "117:36", "change but I'll just speak for myself in", "117:39", "my life for whatever inadequacy that I", "117:41", "have it's been very hard for me to", "117:42", "impact those closest to me so what I", "117:44", "wanted to do my quest was bring in", "117:46", "people that were wildly successful and I", "117:50", "won unprompted I wanted the audience to", "117:53", "see you're gonna hear them say the same", "117:55", "things I say even though we don't know", "117:56", "each other and time after time after", "118:00", "time they heard people going through", "118:02", "these people have never seen the 25", "118:03", "bullet points but they would go through", "118:04", "like I mean maybe it was like six or", "118:06", "seven of them it's not gonna be exactly", "118:07", "the same but they would touch on so many", "118:10", "it was fucking freaky and so that really", "118:14", "started to play into okay we're now", "118:16", "moving into a different era where you", "118:19", "can step forward and I think", "118:20", "transparency and authenticity are a big", "118:22", "fuckin deal in in companies today I", "118:24", "think that gen Z is gonna demand it and", "118:26", "I think any company that hides Jenna do", "118:28", "you say Gen Z Gen Z is that generation", "118:30", "Z's oh yeah yeah have you not heard that", "118:33", "oh man welcome you're gonna hear it", "118:35", "everywhere now so yeah kids oh if you", "118:43", "type in Gen Z you get like a bazillion", "118:45", "sure results so gens ears are known for", "118:49", "like they they say that they're the", "118:52", "altruistic generation so these people", "118:54", "are not comfortable with big business", "118:56", "and I think that they're going to demand", "118:58", "a level of transparency into the people", "119:01", "that are running the company and the", "119:03", "people that get that Elon Musk Richard", "119:08", "Branson people that aren't afraid to", "119:09", "like really step out front mm-hmm then", "119:11", "people just resonate with that and so", "119:14", "that is why I do all this that's why I'm", "119:16", "stepping out front that's why I want", "119:18", "people to know who I am and what I'm", "119:19", "doing I need to build the community if", "119:20", "we're gonna pull off this mission", "119:21", "impossible' of building the studio", "119:23", "that's all got to happen so that's why I", "119:26", "create all this content that's why I", "119:27", "bring people on that have inspired me", "119:29", "and my goal is just to set them up so I", "119:31", "want everyone to walk away from my show", "119:33", "going like off camera behind the scenes", "119:35", "like that was the best interview I've", "119:37", "ever done so", "119:39", "yeah that's that's like my mission I", "119:41", "just want people to see it from all", "119:43", "these different angles here all these", "119:45", "different people say it and quite", "119:46", "frankly selfishly I want to learn and so", "119:48", "one the biggest the thing that probably", "119:50", "impacted my life the most was when I", "119:52", "stopped building my ego around being", "119:54", "smart and I started building my ego", "119:56", "around being a learner and being super", "119:57", "humble and sitting at people's feet and", "119:59", "just wanting to listen and learn and", "120:02", "then immediately put what I learned into", "120:04", "action so the show is also wildly", "120:06", "selfish for me and the staff because we", "120:08", "get to meet incredible people that have", "120:10", "just super empowering wisdom and so I", "120:13", "believe that the dual track of the", "120:15", "social content was just on the nose", "120:17", "right you would come on the show and you", "120:19", "would just tell us like how you did it", "120:20", "you would talk about like how you got", "120:22", "into stand-up comedy I got into stand-up", "120:24", "comedy because I was the fucking funny", "120:25", "guy when everybody else was nervous", "120:26", "right but then like it actually has to", "120:27", "become a craft and you got to do it over", "120:29", "and over and over and talking about that", "120:30", "grind and how you get good over time and", "120:32", "people gonna trip the fuck out and just", "120:34", "like go whoa maybe that's exactly what I", "120:36", "need to do which is a message I think a", "120:38", "lot of people need right now which is", "120:39", "it's a long grind you know so it's stuff", "120:41", "like that but that's impact", "120:43", "Tom I got to wrap this up but thank you", "120:45", "very much man I appreciate it in good", "120:47", "luck it's a very ambitious project and", "120:49", "I'm certainly gonna be watching awesome", "120:51", "man thanks for Stars quest
