all", "08:03", "about being progressive and open-minded", "08:05", "but I think if someone is a man but is", "08:08", "maybe more female typical to say that", "08:10", "this person is a different

different it's a", "08:28", "different body type different", "08:30", "I mean people vary so much that I mean I", "08:34", "think having some sort of categories to", "08:38", "say oh this is a male

wasted", "09:04", "when I don't think that does anything", "09:06", "for women or sexism if you changed", "09:09", "instead of addressing someone by ladies", "09:11", "and gentlemen you say people is that", "09:14", "really gonna stop sexism it just makes", "09:16", "people mad because then they have to", "09:17", "change the way they talk I put up a", "09:19", "story on Twitter the other day about", "09:21", "people that are raising their kids with", "09:23", "a in them they're calling them babies", "09:26", "instead of babies what fuck is that", "09:30", "like I just I think it's coming

you", "09:47", "know not having any sort of prospects", "09:49", "when they grow up in terms of their jobs", "09:50", "or I don't know it's such a terrible", "09:52", "thing to be female typical nowadays but", "09:55", "I mean like you mentioned it's biology", "09:57", "that's going to dictate what your kids", "09:58", "play with and then in other cases I", "09:59", "think it's parents that want to be", "10:00", "special well it's also weird because if", "10:03", "your son is trans it's totally fine for", "10:07", "him to be female typical mmm-hmm yeah", "10:09", "like it's celebrated

is it that we can't ask these", "14:34", "questions why is it that even this", "14:36", "question right now I could be accused of", "14:38", "being transphobic for asking yeah how", "14:41", "many of these people are ill yeah well", "14:43", "both of us are gonna be accused of", "14:45", "transphobia after this yeah yeah I mean", "14:47", "I would agree with that I do think that", "14:48", "gender

is so trendy right now and in the", "15:12", "past you might have seen this kind of", "15:14", "pathology manifest in a different way", "15:16", "but now because everyone is saying", "15:18", "gender is the way to express you know I", "15:21", "think people also see a fever problem in", "15:22", "your life they think it's gender related", "15:25", "so say with some of the personality", "15:27", "disorder", "15:28", "people like a lot of attention they like", "15:29", "to it's always about them and their", "15:32", "identity and their identity shifts a lot", "15:34", "so this could very well be what it is", "15:37", "and now they're being basically rewarded", "15:38", "for that yeah that's the issue right", "15:40", "that you're dealing with incredibly", "15:43", "indulgent people which do exist and they", "15:45", "then they find this pathway to massive", "15:47", "amounts of attention yeah you know I", "15:49", "mean this is I I had to construct a bit", "15:52", "to mock Caitlyn

don't want to appear cruel", "16:03", "so what is the way to do this so my way", "16:05", "was to mock myself mercilessly and which", "16:09", "is kind of true", "16:10", "like I really do have three daughters", "16:11", "and I really do get brutalized in my", "16:14", "house like I really do think they chip", "16:15", "away at my manhood it's kind of a joke", "16:17", "but I mean it really is

joke was that if my manhood", "16:29", "was a mountain of marbles every day", "16:31", "they'd take two marbles they'd just take", "16:33", "one like you don't even need these these", "16:35", "are what do you care God and then that", "16:38", "I'm not gonna go out like Bruce Jenner", "16:40", "that one day that one day that they that", "16:43", "so I had to concoct this whole thing", "16:45",

yeah and I think I mean this is", "28:46", "very unrelated to the whole I mean but", "28:48", "it's not it's when it comes to gender I", "28:52", "think there's just this thing that", "28:55", "people people want things to be more", "28:58", "easily explained than they are yeah", "29:01", "that's true I could see that because it", "29:03", "takes a lot of work to actually go so", "29:04", "people who say that gender is a social", "29:06", "construct that's a good one", "29:08", "sounds very nice I love saying that", "29:10", "don't start saying that it's not true", "29:12", "but it's infuriating because it's", "29:13", "everywhere now like this is what", "29:15", "children are being taught in school up", "29:17", "in Canada that's what they're being", "29:18", "taught in their

is a social construct", "29:29", "there's what's the argument for it", "29:31", "if you were arguing for it that's I", "29:35", "guess the the idea is that women should", "29:38", "be equal and

as men but why is", "29:56", "different subjugation and why is", "29:57", "different incapable why is different in", "29:59", "fairness because there has been a", "30:00", "history of there being sexism and you", "30:03", "and say so with the whole Google memo", "30:05", "thing and this idea that women are", "30:08", "biologically we are different not to say", "30:10", "we're not as capable

like you", "30:29", "said I think it's just a lot easier and", "30:31", "it's a lazy way to just dismiss the", "30:33", "whole thing and say you know we don't", "30:34", "need to think about it nothing to see", "30:35", "here", "30:36", "you know nothing to see here but it just", "30:38", "it's clearly not true in terms of the", "30:41", "scientific research so there has to be", "30:45", "some cognitive dissonance in order to", "30:47", "accept that and to preach it and to say", "30:49", "it and everybody has to agree upon it", "30:51", "which is", "30:52", "one of the reasons why I think any any", "30:56", "statements contrary to that get", "30:58", "aggressively attacked and this is part", "31:01", "of the reason why these ideas are so", "31:03", "supercharged it's that there's there's a", "31:07", "knowledge there's an understanding that", "31:09", "it's horseshit and so when someone", "31:11", "challenges it and says it's horseshit", "31:13", "you've been living your whole

"31:22", "because they think they're doing", "31:23", "something good for women so they'll say", "31:25", "gender is a social construct even though", "31:26", "they know it's biological and I think", "31:28", "people who are younger maybe going", "31:30", "through school now we're being taught", "31:31", "this I actually don't know the", "31:32", "difference and actually believe it but", "31:34", "why would they aggressively attack the", "31:38", "scientific research that's contrary to", "31:41", "that claim then you mean the people who", "31:43", "don't know any better", "31:44", "yeah who would they actually believe", "31:45", "that gender is a social construct and", "31:46", "these scientists are just sexist and", "31:48", "misogynistic we want to keep women down", "31:50", "but I can get that if you didn't", "31:52", "research it if you didn't look into it", "31:54", "but once you start looking into it you", "31:55", "go oh wow this is weird but it's clearly", "31:57", "I mean do you think people actually look", "32:01", "into it though I don't think they do the", "32:02", "sense I get is they they find someone or", "32:05", "some journalist who has has some sort of", "32:08",

explain the lawsuit for", "42:04", "people who don't okay so it turns out", "42:06", "that for decades now Harvard has been", "42:08", "discriminating against Asians and", "42:10", "requiring them to have higher SAT scores", "42:13", "than people of other ethnic backgrounds", "42:15", "in order to get the same chance of", "42:16", "admission and then more recently it's", "42:18", "been shown that", "42:19", "okay so Asians do well with SAT scores", "42:21", "they do both extracurricular activities", "42:24", "so the only way that admissions", "42:26", "committees can actually penalize

that even when I was", "42:53", "covering the New York Times every", "42:54", "burglar okay yeah let's go on with our", "42:56", "day gone yeah in and out", "42:58", "yeah whereas if it was in about any", "43:00", "other subject or any other race or", "43:04", "gender that's being discriminated", "43:05", "against I mean if it was discrimination", "43:07", "against black people the same like",

the most", "43:24", "successful in terms of academics cuz", "43:25", "that's the problem right yeah the", "43:27", "problem is not helping Society either I", "43:29", "mean if I were not Asian I would be", "43:30", "saying the same thing I don't think it", "43:32", "makes sense to take people who are doing", "43:33", "well and hold them back", "43:35", "you know if you want your society to do",

the", "64:01", "the life that we live and then adapting", "64:03", "the culture and trying to figure out how", "64:05", "to be accepted yeah I think that that", "64:07", "certainly plays a part this

and", "172:58", "understanding what they are and also", "173:00", "examining my own speech patterns and the", "173:03", "way I communicate and getting better at", "173:06", "it I like how you said you started it", "173:08", "just because you wanted to talk to", "173:09", "people but I think that's what it should", "173:11", "be it should just be that interest in", "173:13", "having a conversation while you still", "173:15", "like doing radio when I was a guest you", "173:18", "know uncertain radio stick shows you", "173:20", "know like you do like if I was going to", "173:23", "say I'd go to

"like always the censorship I was like oh", "173:48", "I feel like you got a censor yourself", "173:49", "then I started doing the Opie and", "173:52", "Anthony show and Opie and Anthony had", "173:53", "the show on you know was first it was XM", "173:56", "then it became serious and and then they", "174:00", "split up but when I would do that", "174:02", "it was Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton", "174:04", "and I was like this is the best this is", "174:07", "so fun and the way they did it credit to", "174:10", "them the way they did it was different", "174:13", "than any radio show had ever been a part", "174:15", "of because it was no structure you know", "174:17", "they would just bring comics in it would", "174:19", "just be me and Ari Shaffir and Bill burr", "174:22", "and Joey Diaz and all these guys they", "174:24", "would just come in and hang out and talk", "174:26", "shit there was no structure at all it", "174:29", "was just anthony is such a smart and", "174:31",

"174:39", "just come in and hang out and have fun", "174:41", "hmm", "174:42", "and then then I started doing a podcast", "174:46", "after that but it was because", "174:48", "that and then Anthony did a thing called", "174:50", "live from the compound he calls his", "174:52", "house the compound and he did like this", "174:54", "thing in his basement we had a green", "174:56", "screen and he did his own show and he", "174:58", "did karaoke while he's holding a machine", "175:00", "guy he's fucking crazy", "175:01", "gun nut but he had a studio that he", "175:05", "built in his basement like with", "175:06", "legitimate equipment and I went oh and", "175:10", "that inspired me and that that is", "175:12", "literally what started me off to do a", "175:15", "podcast seeing that he had set this up", "175:17", "in his basement just fucking just start", "175:21", "doing it yeah Wow yeah I was gonna say", "175:25", "the same thing I feel the wrong speak", "175:26", "the fact that I can see people being", "175:29", "mobbed and I can think okay I wonder", "175:31", "what they're like and I can just ask", "175:33", "them yeah yeah like is that what it's", "175:36", "like for you you see someone you think I", "175:37", "just want to talk to them oh yeah yeah", "175:40", "especially someone in a controversial", "175:43", "position like Jordan when I first met", "175:45", "Jordan it's like when he was just", "175:48", "starting to get some attention online", "175:51", "mm-hmm and I wanted to talk to him I was", "175:53", "like well what is going on here and why", "175:55", "why is everybody up so upset at you and", "175:57", "I've never met anyone in in all of my", "176:00", "life who is so purposely misrepresented", "176:04", "yeah by other people than Jordan yeah", "176:06", "I've never seen it before it's it's", "176:08", "amazing to see intelligent articulate", "176:12", "people clearly lying about his positions", "176:16", "and about how and not and not even", "176:19", "understanding that by doing that they're", "176:22", "strengthening him yeah and they're", "176:23", "strengthening the there you're not going", "176:26", "to lie to the point where people are", "176:29", "going to really think that your position", "176:33", "is correct and all these things that", "176:35", "Jordan is said that somehow or another", "176:38", "you've misheard them or the whole world", "176:40", "misheard them you're misrepresenting his", "176:43", "positions and that just makes all the", "176:46", "people that are siding with him realize", "176:48", "he's right yeah it strengthens him they", "176:51", "literally don't understand that they are", "176:54", "his publicists they are helping they are", "176:58", "proving his point mm and to the point", "177:00", "where he's selling", "177:01", "he sold out gigantic 5000 seat theaters", "177:07", "yeah", "177:08", "he's selling them out all over the world", "177:09", "just talking", "177:11", "it's crazy he's making millions of", "177:13", "dollars yeah because of them being", "177:15", "stupid it's fucking amazing yeah", "177:18", "it's really amazing and all of it came", "177:22", "out of him putting his foot down in", "177:27", "opposition of the very same things that", "177:28", "you experienced then forced you to leave", "177:30", "academia it's misrepresenting of reality", "177:33", "mm-hmm that seems to be going and I", "177:36", "think it's fueling the it's certainly", "177:40", "fueling the dork web but on top of that", "177:42", "because people are seeing that they", "177:45", "can't trust what they're being told yeah", "177:47", "they are they can't trust what they're", "177:51", "being told and they understand there's", "177:54", "other conversations to be had out there", "177:55", "mm-hmm there was an article that I", "177:57", "tweeted today that was really", "177:59", "interesting I was like wow this is crazy", "178:00", "it was talking about long-form podcasts", "178:04", "and the ability that long-form podcasts", "178:08", "have to allow people to to have rational", "178:13", "civil discourse mm-hmm instead of just", "178:17", "like getting on these fucking CNN shows", "178:20", "and yelling at each other for three", "178:21", "minutes or sometimes you'll get a panel", "178:23", "where everyone just agrees with each", "178:24", "other yes", "178:25", "yeah or the panels are crazy too how", "178:28", "that fuck you're gonna have nine people", "178:29", "talking at the same time that is crazy", "178:32", "it's hard to do when I do podcast with", "178:34", "two other people", "178:35", "hmm it's hard well it's entertainment", "178:37", "but it's not a good way to discuss", "178:40", "topics you know long-form conversations", "178:43", "are really the only way where you can", "178:46", "get a good sense of where someone stands", "178:50", "on a position and how they think hmm you", "178:53", "know I get a chance to see like you like", "178:55", "a lot of people are gonna get a chance", "178:57", "to see you today how you think about", "178:59", "things what what your thought process is", "179:01", "and if there's holes in that thought", "179:03", "process they get exposed mm-hmm yeah and", "179:06", "that's I think also with issues that are", "179:08", "more complex you can talk about all the", "179:10", "different nuances to that issue because", "179:13", "if you just simply have your", "179:15", "gain points and you sort of if you do", "179:16", "like a standard interview that's say", "179:18", "seven minutes long it's going to be very", "179:21", "very sparse in terms of what you're", "179:22", "saying yeah I mean there's not a single", "179:25", "thing we discussed today that wasn't 15", "179:28", "minutes long at least right yeah and you", "179:31", "can't really condense that I mean you", "179:33", "could condense it down but you lose a", "179:34", "lot of the information and also you feel", "179:36", "like you didn't didn't do it justice", "179:38", "mm-hmm like I can't do those panel shows", "179:41", "because I feel like I don't there's no", "179:42", "way I'm gonna be able to do anything", "179:44", "justice I just is not there's no room", "179:46", "especially now well people play it up to", "179:49", "they know that they're there for the", "179:51", "entertainment value so it's more about", "179:52", "being upset at what someone's saying", "179:54", "then some real under some real", "179:55", "understanding right it's also about", "179:57", "barking out your talking points and it's", "179:59", "like ferocious a man or as you can", "180:02", "appear that you're winning yeah yeah so", "180:05", "it's just you're a nice guy too though", "180:06", "you know you're not gonna come and", "180:07", "attack somebody I definitely don't want", "180:09", "to do that that the when I have people", "180:13", "on I even someone that I think I'm gonna", "180:15", "disagree with I just want I want to see", "180:18", "how they think I want even I'm one and", "180:21", "some people get mad they go oh dude you", "180:23", "know you more for your opinions based on", "180:25", "whoever's on the show that's not what I", "180:27", "do but what I do do is I let people talk", "180:29", "and I try to see their point of view and", "180:32", "I try to expand their point of view so", "180:35", "if they say something oh so so what it", "180:37", "is is that this you know I want them to", "180:39", "keep going why I want to I want to see", "180:42", "the landscape or their thought process I", "180:44", "don't want to want to see a tiny garden", "180:47", "I don't want to see a little potted", "180:49", "plant I want to see the whole thing I", "180:51", "want to get a sense of why do I disagree", "180:53", "with them what am i fucked up maybe it's", "180:56", "me you know maybe it's maybe it's them", "180:58", "but that's how it should be - I don't", "181:00", "think people should be stuck in their", "181:01", "opinion even no matter how right you", "181:02", "think you are I think you should always", "181:04", "be open to changing your mind I think so", "181:07", "too but I think that's one of the rarest", "181:09", "qualities when it comes to discourse is", "181:12", "the ability that people have to abandon", "181:14", "ideas that they've supported in the past", "181:17", "because what does that mean then if", "181:18", "you're on one side and everyone in your", "181:20", "life thinks this way what does it mean", "181:22", "if you don't think that way yeah well", "181:25", "what is what are the are the ideas you", "181:28", "are you you and the ideas are just", "181:30", "things that you're you're examining yeah", "181:33", "that's what it should be mm-hmm but for", "181:35", "most people including me most of my life", "181:37", "that was not the case if I had an idea", "181:39", "and I if I supported that idea that I'll", "181:41", "fucking fight you yeah this is this I'm", "181:43", "right you're wrong and so what changed", "181:46", "then doing this doing this podcast", "181:50", "change the way I talk to people change", "181:53", "the way I look at life mm-hmm I've", "181:55", "talked to so many smart people mm-hmm I", "181:57", "mean I've had a thousand one hundred", "182:01", "twelve hundred 1200 podcasts plus all", "182:05", "the MMA ones there's so many", "182:09", "conversations so and through those", "182:11", "conversations I've gotten at least not a", "182:15", "formal education but an understanding of", "182:17", "things that I never had before mm-hmm", "182:19", "across a lot of subjects too yeah yeah", "182:21", "and through that I think of understand", "182:25", "I've come to understand not just how I", "182:28", "think about things but why why I've had", "182:33", "roadblocks and conversations before and", "182:36", "speed bumps and and I've learned you", "182:39", "know I think if you examine your own", "182:41", "yourself and your own thoughts you're", "182:44", "you're sure to learn mm-hmm hopefully", "182:46", "yeah and I think it also can help if you", "182:49", "look at the other side it can help you", "182:51", "figure out why you believe what you", "182:53", "believe too because you can look at them", "182:54", "and say okay I still don't agree with", "182:57", "you and this is why I think if people", "182:59", "aren't even willing to look at the other", "183:00", "side and consider why they might be", "183:02", "wrong how do you really know yeah and", "183:05", "then you also run into some people that", "183:08", "they don't really have opinions they", "183:11", "have these things that they've adopted", "183:13", "like slogans yeah they've gotten these", "183:16", "things they've decided this is what my", "183:18", "side supports so I'm gonna just spout", "183:20", "this out and this makes me seem like I'm", "183:22", "a good team player and and then
