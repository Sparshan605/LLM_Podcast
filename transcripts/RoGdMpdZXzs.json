some", "00:11", "corporations a while back because I've", "00:13", "done some consulting and I had designed", "00:15", "tests to help people hire better", "00:17", "employees which I still do and in

they", "00:37", "kept asking me what could be done about", "00:39", "their poorer performing employees and I", "00:41", "said well I didn't know because it's not", "00:44", "that easy to if you have someone who's", "00:46", "problematic who's troubled it's not that", "00:48", "easy for a manager to figure out how to", "00:49", "straighten them out and they just don't", "00:52", "have the time they don't have the time", "00:54", "they don't have the manpower and they", "00:55", "don't have the training usually to do", "00:56", "that but I designed this set of programs", "00:58", "called the self authoring suite and one", "01:01", "of them the future authoring program", "01:03", "helps people write out a plan for their", "01:05", "life so it helps them ask you some", "01:08", "questions

if you", "01:25", "set it up for you like you or someone", "01:27", "you were taking care of so it asks you", "01:29", "those six questions then it asks you to", "01:32", "write for 15 minutes about about your", "01:35", "vision for your life you get to have", "01:37", "what you want and what would be good for", "01:38", "you what would that be and then it asks", "01:41", "you to write for 15

foolishness is and your weaknesses", "01:50", "take the upper hand and auger you into", "01:52", "the ground because everyone knows about", "01:53", "that and so it's like you get to design", "01:55", "a little heaven to strive for and a", "01:57", "little hell to avoid and then you write", "01:59", "for then you basically turn that into an", "02:02", "implementable plan that's the second",

well for men", "02:52", "because men are at more risk of dropping", "02:54", "out now and especially for men who", "02:56", "didn't have good grades in high school", "02:57", "so not only is there the possibility for", "03:00", "the net to provide tremendous", "03:03", "dissemination of the intellectual", "03:05", "material but there's also the", "03:06", "possibility for the net to provide",

"03:28", "questions what would you like to do", "03:30", "please describe this what is your view", "03:32", "and when you do that you sort of allow", "03:35", "them to help themselves outline what", "03:38", "they would like to accomplish which most", "03:39", "people don't do know allowing our", "03:41", "education system our education system", "03:43", "was designed in Chicago in the late", "03:45", "1800s to produce factory workers because", "03:49", "it was set up when when rural people", "03:51", "were migrating to the cities on mass", "03:53", "because their kids first of all we're", "03:54", "likely to get factory jobs and second of", "03:56", "all if you were working in a factory", "03:57", "your kids needed to be taken care of and", "03:59", "so the purpose of the schools was to", "04:01", "train factory workers which is why", "04:04", "everyone's lined up in roles rose and", "04:06", "why there are bells it's a factory model", "04:08", "the problem with that is that now", "04:10", "people's careers basically have to be", "04:12", "self determined but that's never that's", "04:14", "never part of the education system part", "04:16", "of the reason I developed these programs", "04:18", "was because I realized this is the same", "04:20", "course where I'm teaching students that", "04:22", "if they would have been in Germany in", "04:23", "the 1930s they would have been Nazis", "04:26", "I'm trying to get them to design their", "04:28", "lives and it's way better to have", "04:32", "someone articulate their own plan you", "04:35", "actually neurologically rewire

good", "04:44", "advice if they would explain what that", "04:45", "means it's like if you have to conjure", "04:48", "up the thoughts and you have to", "04:50", "articulate them then they change you and", "04:52", "so well and so this program has had the", "04:57", "the the effects have been absolutely", "05:00", "overwhelming for us as researchers", "05:02", "because it's very very difficult to", "05:04", "produce an intervention that actually", "05:06", "has a positive effect on people you know", "05:08", "you hope it does but generally when you", "05:10", "test it out it's like not doesn't do", "05:12", "what you thought it did or sometimes it", "05:13", "even has the reverse effect that sounds", "05:15", "fascinating how do people have how can", "05:18", "someone a regular person have access", "05:19", "yeah it's called self authoring so", "05:22", "that's SEL F authoring like like writing", "05:25", "a book self authoring calm and the", "05:28", "programs I gave away the future", "05:29", "authoring program I think it might still", "05:31", "be free it was yeah it is till the end", "05:34", "of November I did a video called message", "05:37", "to Millennials where

stage that the", "06:14", "developmental psychologist Jean Piaget", "06:15", "called the messianic stage and he", "06:17", "associated that with late adolescence", "06:19", "it's like while young

you want to change the", "06:29", "world you should change yourself and I", "06:30", "don't mean that some cliched sense I", "06:32", "mean it in the sense that Alexander", "06:35", "Solzhenitsyn said when he analyzed the", "06:36", "Soviet Union he said don't be thinking", "06:39", "that the line that", "06:40", "divides good from evil runs down a", "06:42", "political spectrum or or country's or", "06:45", "something like that it runs down right", "06:47", "down the middle of your soul and if you", "06:49", "want to sort out the world and what you", "06:51", "do is you sort yourself out it's a", "06:53", "serious business right they say it's", "06:55", "more difficult to rule yourself than to", "06:57", "rule a city and that's the truth because", "07:00", "you're complicated and

US", "07:09", "powerful and useful person and I gave", "07:13", "away the future authoring program as", "07:15", "part of this video I made suggesting to", "07:18", "Millennials that instead of rushing out", "07:19", "there to change the world by changing", "07:21", "other bad people that they should look", "07:23", "inward and sort themselves out properly", "07:25", "and I think we've given away about four", "07:28", "or five thousand of those programs so", "07:30", "far I said about three to the end of", "07:32", "November and what happens with it it's", "07:34", "well the self or the future authoring", "07:36", "program is regularly $14.95 and the", "07:39", "whole self authoring suite which", "07:40", "involves it's a program that helps you", "07:42", "write an autobiography so it helps you", "07:44", "sort out things about your past that are", "07:46", "still burdening you you can tell a if if", "07:49", "you have a memory that's more than", "07:50", "eighteen months old approximately and", "07:52", "when you pull that memory up to mind if", "07:56", "you still have an emotional reaction", "07:57", "that means you haven't fully articulated", "08:00", "the memory you haven't analyzed it", "08:03", "causally you haven't you haven't freed", "08:05", "yourself from its grasp and you're", "08:07", "carrying it like a weight and your brain", "08:09", "responds to that

makes you old some of this work", "08:22", "has been done by James Pennebaker at the", "08:23", "University of Texas at Austin because he", "08:25", "he started to pioneer these sorts of", "08:27", "writing programs and he found that if", "08:29", "people wrote about uncertain things past", "08:32", "present or future so they could be", "08:35", "traumatic things they could be uncertain", "08:36", "things that their physical health", "08:37", "improved and he he did a lot of detailed", "08:40", "research trying to figure out why that", "08:42", "was and basically came down to the", "08:44", "explanation that it was something like", "08:47", "an uncertainty reduction mechanism at", "08:49", "work", "08:49", "because your brain is always figuring", "08:51", "out how well situated are you in the", "08:53", "world", "08:53", "how much do you not know compared to how", "08:55", "much have you mastered and you can tell", "08:57", "that you've mastered things because when", "08:59", "you go somewhere and you act things turn", "09:01", "out the way you want them that's an", "09:03", "indication of mastery and your brain is", "09:05", "sort of keeping track across your whole", "09:07", "life of how many places you've been", "09:09", "where things haven't worked out compared", "09:11", "to how many places you have been where", "09:13", "they have worked out and if all those", "09:15", "places in your past where things haven't", "09:17", "worked out you need to map and master", "09:20", "and that that decreases the existential", "09:24", "load on you but that actually decreases", "09:26", "your psychophysiological load it makes", "09:28", "you healthier it makes you less stressed", "09:30", "and so we put all that together in this", "09:32", "self authoring suite to help people", "09:34", "write about their past to sort it out in", "09:36", "a in a detailed autobiography to ask you", "09:38", "questions about your past it says divide", "09:40", "your life up into six epochs and then", "09:44", "divide each of those that might be say", "09:46", "old birth to kindergarten and then maybe", "09:48", "elementary school and then maybe junior", "09:49", "high school however you want to do it", "09:51", "and then to write about the emotionally", "09:53", "significant events in each of those", "09:56", "epochs and then to describe their", "09:58", "effects on you and then to analyze how", "10:01", "you did in those situations what you", "10:03", "might have done differently what you", "10:04", "might have do differently in the future", "10:05", "to straighten out your past and I've", "10:08", "done that with my students in my maps of", "10:10", "meeting class for about the last ten", "10:11", "years and some people have written", "10:12", "15,000 words it's not that uncommon for", "10:15", "students to write 15,000 words in their", "10:17", "autobiography Wow so that's such great", "10:20", "advice that's such great advice about", "10:22", "reconciling with your past because so", "10:24", "many people just carry it around yeah", "10:25", "well if you're if you're thinking about", "10:27", "your past what it means is you haven't", "10:30", "analyzed the causal change because you", "10:32", "might say well why do you remember your", "10:34", "past well you might say well it's in", "10:36", "order to have an objective you know", "10:38", "record of the past it's like it has", "10:39", "nothing to do with that there's only one", "10:41", "reason you remember the past and that's", "10:44", "to be prepared for the future that's why", "10:46", "you remember the past and so what you're", "10:48", "supposed to do is take the past and", "10:50", "extract out from it wisdom and wisdom is", "10:54", "the ability to avoid stumbling blindly", "10:56", "into ditches and so you think well", "10:59", "here's a time in my past I stumbled", "11:01", "blindly into this horrible ditch and", "11:03", "terrible things happen to me it's like", "11:04", "okay you need to take that apart you", "11:07", "need to", "11:07", "how was it that that events conspired", "11:11", "with your participation voluntarily or", "11:14", "involuntarily so that that terrible", "11:16", "consequence emerged you need to know why", "11:19", "that happened and how you could react", "11:21", "differently in that situation and as", "11:23", "soon as you do that your brain will", "11:25", "leave it alone you won't obsess you", "11:27", "about it anymore because the", "11:28", "anxiety-producing parts of your brain", "11:30", "are basically trying to tell you where", "11:32", "there are obstacles in your environment", "11:34", "it's like look out don't go there don't", "11:36", "go there it's like well don't go there", "11:39",
