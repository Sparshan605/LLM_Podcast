outs mm maybe", "26:34", "should switch to like 18 or 20 yeah", "26:37", "get a thicker padding in the front it'll", "26:39", "protect your knuckles better and it even", "26:41", "gives you a better workout really", "26:42", "because you're pushing more weight a", "26:43", "little heavier yeah yeah pushing more", "26:44", "weight and you'll have more more impact", "26:47", "but another thing I

explode with the same", "27:05", "amount of force but you know you're", "27:07", "sinking into that bag and so a lot of", "27:10", "people with tendonitis find that that's", "27:12", "a way better option there's another I", "27:14", "have two bags out there one of them is a", "27:17", "fairtex bag and fair text makes a it's a", "27:20", "muay thai bag but it's softer and the", "27:23", "other

if I'm injured if like my", "27:32", "shoulders bother me or something like", "27:34", "that I can dig into that bag and it's", "27:36", "not gonna have the same jolt yeah", "27:38", "hitting something solid and hard so if", "27:40", "you're having problems with your hands", "27:41", "that's what I would say another thing", "27:42", "you can do is they make wraps there are", "27:45", "gel wraps you slide them on your hand", "27:47", "almost like a glove", "27:48", "yeah that's what he just told me about", "27:49", "what you guys are trained with yeah", "27:50", "those are great yeah

you have to do it lightly", "28:36", "the thing about weightlifting is people", "28:38", "want to do it to failure all the time", "28:39", "you know do ten sets of this and five", "28:42", "sets of that and go to failure every", "28:44", "time come on push push push but yeah", "28:46", "don't do that you shouldn't do that yeah", "28:48", "I subscribe to the Pavel", "28:50", "at Cellini method he's a famous Russian", "28:54", "kettlebell instructor and his philosophy", "28:56", "is that you should do more sets but less", "29:00", "repetition so like say if you could do a", "29:02", "weight and you could lift it 10 times", "29:04", "don't lift it ten times lived it five", "29:06", "right he lifted ten let's talk about", "29:12", "esophageal cancer", "29:14", "my voice is rebelling but if you say if", "29:16", "you could lift something 10 times lift", "29:18", "it five times and just do more sets and", "29:21", "give yourself a lot of time in between", "29:23", "sets because if you're trained for", "29:25", "strength you can do certain things like", "29:27", "kettlebells and specific where it's", "29:30", "strength but it's also endurance but", "29:32", "really if you just want to do strength", "29:33", "the best way to do it is to do a short", "29:37", "set of a few repetitions and then do", "29:41", "multiple versions of that like take a", "29:43", "long time off like 5-10 minutes and then", "29:45", "do another 5 reps 5-10 minutes do", "29:47", "another 5 reps and then do it again in a", "29:50", "couple of days and then do it again", "29:52", "stead of like once a week where you just", "29:53", "blow your body out you're like ahhh that", "29:56", "feeling we could barely move that's", "29:57", "terrible", "29:58", "yes it's not a smart way because you",

"30:17", "like you know you'll stay to a minute", "30:18", "and maybe the tempo is like you know", "30:22", "what I mean so whatever even if it's", "30:23", "quick and you're not doing everything", "30:25", "like exactly technique wise really slow", "30:28", "and you know it's it's kind of like", "30:31", "making sure you stay up with the tempo", "30:32", "which I feel like really helped me with", "30:34", "with staying quick and fast with drums", "30:36", "and more endurance you know yeah that", "30:38", "makes sense like is is drumming a young", "30:41", "man's game I mean is it like
