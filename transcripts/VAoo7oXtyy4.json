mean that's a bit later", "68:38", "longer in the tooth but also MMA", "68:40", "certainly there like like everything", "68:42", "eventually goes towards what is", "68:44", "incentivized and how you

too good of an", "68:56", "athlete they know how to game the system", "68:57", "to go out round by round scoring no you", "69:00", "got to get rid of that you got to get", "69:01", "rid of the five minute round you got to", "69:03", "go at least probably six maybe ten don't", "69:06", "you think there's also a problem in", "69:08", "incentivizing people to just win because", "69:10", "you have a win bonus that's win bonus I", "69:13", "do not like I have said this from the", "69:16", "beginning I just don't think it's fair", "69:18", "first of all if you got to do a win", "69:20", "bonus you need to do something about the", "69:22", "judging yes 100% you need to have a", "69:25", "better scoring system and you need to", "69:27", "get rid of incompetence and then when", "69:29", "you go to other states you need to take", "69:30", "control the situation and accountability", "69:32", "too it's in other states it's dire might", "69:35", "give you and I don't want to name States", "69:36", "but there's been say it so we do fights", "69:38", "where I'm just going what who watched", "69:40", "that fight yeah I hear how was that that", "69:42", "was this even possible people just get", "69:43", "fucking robbed", "69:44", "yes so if you have wind bonuses and you", "69:47", "know if a guy comes in and he's getting", "69:50", "50 and then if he wins he gets another", "69:52", "50 you stole $50,000 from that guy by", "69:55", "giving him incompetent judging yes and I", "69:57", "don't if you're a fighter you got to do", "69:59", "your best to win if that means take guy", "70:01", "down and hump them and and throw enough", "70:03", "punches keep the referee from standing", "70:05", "up that's $50,000 now add in oh yeah by", "70:08", "the way you lose we can just cut your", "70:10", "contract yep yep and no snow no security", "70:13", "yep yeah it's crazy but it doesn't you", "70:15", "know that doesn't help anybody really", "70:16", "and I would say a better system would be", "70:19", "to have a win bonus and a finish bonus", "70:23", "and the finish bonus be double the win", "70:25", "bonus I say no win bonus or at least it", "70:28", "sounds great finish bonus sounds great", "70:30", "that's just gonna entice people to fight", "70:32", "harder but of course I want a fighter to", "70:34", "know that if you're you're gonna get X", "70:36", "amount of dollars this is what you're", "70:37", "getting for that fight it's not you're", "70:39", "gonna get half that because the judges", "70:40", "are idiots correct yeah no I feel you", "70:42", "there and that's a lot of ways the UFC", "70:46", "style of pricing which seems to be kind", "70:49", "of the general model for you for MMA is", "70:52", "that yeah you get you get 5 bucks to", "70:55", "fight and 5 bucks to win for a guy that", "70:57", "you might have paid them eight dollars", "70:59", "to just fight yeah you know so there's", "71:01", "where and and I understand the concept", "71:03", "of a win bonus is incentivizing but it", "71:06", "only incentivizes to win it doesn't", "71:07", "incentivize to finish and those guys at", "71:11", "the top level guys are trying to fuck", "71:14", "here
