a lot", "53:13", "of people at about a lot of positive", "53:15", "effects with that I have HTP is great", "53:16", "that's why I have the whole product you", "53:18", "know roll it roll it roll over yeah my", "53:20", "product roll over is dedicated", "53:22", "specifically to that so yeah but you're", "53:23", "selling those a much smaller package", "53:25", "you're selling like four of those you", "53:27", "get bottles a 30-year bottle thirty just", "53:28", "like this yeah and so do you recommend", "53:31", "people taking that if they're not coming", "53:32", "off of a you know the roll-on roll-off", "53:34", "is supposed to be like you do MDMA and", "53:37", "then your anytime if you're not sleeping", "53:39", "if you're stressed and you're not", "53:41", "sleeping that's when

you're not going", "53:49", "to be producing enough serotonin so", "53:51", "that's when you need to take it so yeah", "53:53", "I certainly recommend taking it as part", "53:55", "of the regimen I mean that formula will", "53:57", "probably change a little bit in the next", "53:58", "iteration I have some ideas for it but", "54:00", "I'm going to always have a serotonin", "54:02", "specific formula you know if enough", "54:06", "people want to have this alpha brain be", "54:08", "that complete brain thing we can look at", "54:10", "it but just as far as dose and capsule", "54:12", "size it's difficult to do everything I", "54:14", "mean I have a capsule that's", "54:16", "specifically designed for serotonin the", "54:18", "whole capsule capsule be way too much", "54:20", "it's tough it's tough so you so that one", "54:22", "was something that I do recommend I do", "54:24", "sell on on it calm but it's not in the", "54:27", "Alpha brain but I highly recommend it's", "54:29", "a great it's a great thing to have I use", "54:31", "it all the time I love it", "54:32", "I don't take it every day but I", "54:34", "definitely take it on like days I'm sure", "54:35", "feel jacked up in it I think I I've been", "54:38", "taking for like I don't know like six", "54:40", "eight months here and there and I it's", "54:42", "one of my favorite things that I've got", "54:43", "the roll on and roll overs or not yeah", "54:45", "those so those formulas though will", "54:47", "change a little bit but I'm still gonna", "54:49", "always keep that kind of concept and you", "54:51", "know the alpha brain is getting great", "54:53", "feedback I know", "54:54", "you know all of us here we all take it", "54:56", "and we dig it so there's something going", "54:58", "on with it yeah most certainly does have", "55:00", "an effect like I said it gives me the", "55:03", "most incredible dreams and so the reason", "55:05", "why that's happening is the seed of", "55:06", "choline regulates REM sleep that's what", "55:09", "determines you know you get a wash of", "55:10", "acetylcholine during your REM sleep so", "55:13", "the fact that you have excess surpluses", "55:15", "of acetylcholine created by the GPC", "55:17", "choline in the Perseus errata", "55:19", "allows a deeper and broader wash of", "55:22", "acetylcholine to go through your sleep", "55:25", "cycles and so

this it's available now and", "55:36", "on it calm onn IT calm and it's called", "55:42", "alpha brain and tell me how you like it", "55:45", "I know some people who've already", "55:46", "started taking it and I haven't yet to", "55:49", "talk to one person that hasn't had", "55:51", "positive experiences with it and it's no", "55:55", "what is it thirty bucks for thirty of", "55:56", "these things and people say it's it's", "55:58", "expensive but like this the stuff's not", "56:00", "cheap stuff it's it's what's needed to", "56:03", "actually have an effect I went to Benson", "56:06",
