if you think about the impulse to say", "05:59", "learn to code what it's really saying is", "06:02", "you need to do something that the market", "06:04", "values mmm-hmm it's like hey being a", "06:06", "truck driver the markets not going to", "06:08", "value that much when the truck start", "06:10", "driving themselves in the next five to", "06:12", "ten years so what does the market

you look at", "06:22", "the numbers about 8% of American jobs", "06:27", "right now are in STEM fields like in", "06:29", "technology engineering math etc so you", "06:31", "talking about 92 percent

in", "07:42", "various ways in the numbers now when", "07:45", "you're talking about universal basic", "07:46", "income - there's two questions to come", "07:48", "up how much money and where is it coming", "07:50", "from yeah so first I want to say that if", "07:53", "you look at the heritage of universal", "07:55", "basic income it's a deeply American idea", "07:57", "where Thomas Paine was forward at the", "07:59", "founding of the country and then Martin", "08:01", "Luther King was for it Milton Friedman", "08:03", "the Godfather of conservative economists", "08:05", "was for it and one state has had it in", "08:08", "effect for 37 years where everyone in", "08:10", "that state gets between one and two", "08:11", "thousand dollars a year no questions", "08:13", "asked this is Alaska yeah it's Alaska", "08:15", "and they funded with oil money and what", "08:17", "I'm going around telling people is that", "08:18", "technology is the oil of the 21st", "08:20", "century so I know you spoke to another", "08:23", "guest about hey how do you get let's say", "08:26", "approximately three trillion dollars a", "08:27", "year to fund universal basic income and", "08:30", "the great thing is that it's well the", "08:32", "first thing is it's not actually three", "08:34", "trillion and the reason why it's not", "08:35", "three trillion is that if you look at", "08:37", "what we're currently doing we have we're", "08:40", "spending about 1.5 trillion right now", "08:42", "126 welfare programs and Social Security", "08:45", "and so if you show up to someone's door", "08:48", "and say hey here's a dividend of $1,000", "08:51", "a month but if you're already getting", "08:54", "more than a thousand dollars and stuff", "08:55", "we're not just gonna stack it on top you", "08:58", "know we're gonna just gonna say you're", "08:59", "guaranteed a thousand and if you're", "09:01", "already getting more than this doesn't", "09:02", "touch you you can keep your current", "09:03", "stuff if you're getting 700 and and", "09:07", "whatnot then you can just get 300 on top", "09:08", "so the three trillion actually shrinks a", "09:11", "lot very fast because of the fact that", "09:13", "about half of Americans are already", "09:15", "getting various income support from the", "09:18", "government so the real price tag is", "09:20", "closer to about 1.8 trillion if you say", "09:23", "everyone who's 18 and up now for context", "09:26", "the entire US economy is now 20 trillion", "09:29", "up five trillion in the last 12 years", "09:31", "and the federal budgets four trillion so", "09:33", "you're looking at 1.8 trillion it's a", "09:36", "lot of money but it's actually", "09:38", "manageable and one of the things that I", "09:41", "haven't heard discussed here with you is", "09:44", "that when you put money into people's", "09:46", "hands the money doesn't disappear like", "09:48", "if I gave you a thousand bucks a month", "09:50", "it probably would not make a big", "09:51", "difference in the economy because", "09:52", "they're just going to your account", "09:54", "somewhere and you know nothing would", "09:55", "happen but we all know that right now", "09:58", "most Americans are living paycheck to", "09:59", "paycheck 57 percent of Americans can't", "10:03", "afford an unexpected $500 bill so you", "10:05", "put $1,000 a month into their hands it's", "10:07", "gonna go right back in the economy", "10:09", "they're gonna spend it on food child", "10:11", "care car repairs they've been putting", "10:14", "off the occasional night out and then", "10:16", "all of those businesses end up hiring", "10:17", "more people and then we end up getting", "10:19", "some of the money back as tax revenues", "10:22", "so of the 1.8 trillion you were gonna", "10:26", "get back let's call it 400 billion in", "10:28", "new tax receipts because everyone's", "10:31", "gonna be spending more money we're gonna", "10:33", "save one to two hundred billion on", "10:35", "things like incarceration and", "10:37", "homelessness services and emergency room", "10:40", "health care I was in New Hampshire last", "10:44", "month and a prison guard said to me", "10:46", "there's a prison guard", "10:47", "he said we should pay people to stay out", "10:49", "of jail because we waste so much money", "10:51", "when they're in jail like he sees all", "10:53", "the waste in the system so if you", "10:56", "imagine a society where everyone's", "10:57", "getting a thousand bucks a month that's", "10:59", "like a it's a great incentive to try and", "11:01", "stay out of jail because you know you", "11:03", "stop getting hit if you wind up in jail", "11:05", "and it reduces recidivism because when", "11:07", "you", "11:08", "mataji at least you have you know a", "11:09", "thousand bucks a month waiting for you", "11:10", "and then you're less inclined to to", "11:12", "commit a crime and head back in how much", "11:14", "crime do you think you'd actually", "11:15", "prevent though by giving people a", "11:16", "thousand dollars a month", "11:17", "I mean think most of the people that are", "11:19", "doing crime whether it's thief thievery", "11:22", "or assault they're not thinking this out", "11:26", "you know this is this is just either a", "11:28", "way of life for them either", "11:30", "you know they're they've got real mental", "11:33", "issues or a pattern of behavior that", "11:35", "they can't break I really don't think", "11:37", "that $1,000 a month is gonna fix any of", "11:40", "that well it's not gonna fix all of it", "11:41", "for sure", "11:42", "and we will still have jails it's not", "11:43", "like you know Silver Bullet you know but", "11:46", "at the margins would it keep like that", "11:49", "person who's falling through the cracks", "11:51", "and feels like they have no place in", "11:53", "society and maybe they you know it's", "11:55", "like the people around them are also", "11:56", "like hey you know you don't have any", "11:58", "value and though you get a thousand", "11:59", "bucks a month maybe like it keeps them", "12:01", "off at the margins and everything we're", "12:02", "talking about is at the margins I mean", "12:05", "everything's like this statistical curve", "12:07", "and you're taking the people who are", "12:09", "let's call it like the last 10 to 20", "12:11", "percent but if you reduce our", "12:13", "incarcerated population by 10 to 20", "12:15", "percent I mean that's billions and", "12:17", "billions of dollars so you you're saving", "12:21", "money on a bunch of things we spend like", "12:23", "about a trillion dollars on right now", "12:24", "like health care incarceration", "12:26", "homelessness services and then the the", "12:29", "magic is that if you have a thousand", "12:31", "bucks a month and you're a parent so you", "12:33", "feel this that studies have shown that", "12:36", "your kids are healthier better nourished", "12:39", "more likely to graduate from high school", "12:41", "and get further education mental health", "12:44", "improves relationships improve domestic", "12:47", "violence Goes Down hospital visits go", "12:50", "down and your worker productivity goes", "12:52", "up I mean you're an entrepreneur and CEO", "12:56", "so you know when you run a company you", "12:58", "say I'm gonna invest in my people I'm", "13:00", "gonna like treat them well and try and", "13:02", "train them and give them resources", "13:03", "because you know that'll increase your", "13:05", "productivity as an organization in the", "13:08", "public sector we have the opposite", "13:09", "approach where like if I can just avoid", "13:12", "spending money on you said you know I'm", "13:16", "gonna somehow save money when we end up", "13:18", "spending that money in very very dark", "13:20", "costly counter", "13:22", "two ways in the backend because they", "13:23", "wind up you know in our institutions and", "13:26", "our institutions just spend a truckload", "13:28", "of money so if you look at the cost", "13:30", "savings and the value gains and the", "13:33", "economic growth that actually gets you", "13:35", "back about a trillion dollars or the 1.8", "13:38", "this is like the trickle up economy", "13:40", "because none of the money disappears it", "13:41", "goes right back into the economy and the", "13:44", "way you get the last eight hundred", "13:45", "billion or so is related to what we", "13:48", "think is happening with AI and all these", "13:49", "advanced technologies because if you", "13:51", "look at who's gonna win with AI and", "13:54", "self-driving cars and trucks the savings", "13:58", "from robot trucks are estimated to be a", "14:00", "hundred sixty eight billion dollars a", "14:01", "year just from that one thing so the", "14:04", "problem is that the American public is", "14:06", "going to see very little of that money", "14:07", "because the winners are gonna be the", "14:10", "trillion dollar tech companies that are", "14:11", "great it is not paying a lot of taxes", "14:13", "they'll move it through Ireland Amazon", "14:16", "will say didn't make any money this", "14:17", "quarter no reason to pay taxes and so", "14:20", "what we need to do is we need to put in", "14:21", "a new tax that actually gets the", "14:23", "American public a slice of every robot", "14:26", "truck mile Amazon transaction facebook", "14:29", "ad and every other industrialized", "14:31", "country already has this tax it's called", "14:33", "a value-added tax and because our", "14:36", "economy is so vast at 20 trillion a", "14:38", "value-added tax that even half the", "14:39", "European level generates about 800", "14:41", "billion in new revenue and that gets you", "14:43", "all the way there so this is much more", "14:45", "achievable and affordable than most", "14:47", "people think when they start unpacking", "14:49", "how the numbers work out so essentially", "14:53", "it'll be the biggest corporations the", "14:55", "the companies that gain or that have the", "14:58", "largest revenue they're gonna be paying", "15:00", "most of this yeah but they're gonna get", "15:02", "some of that money back obviously", "15:03", "because how the things I say to the CEOs", "15:05", "it's like if everyone in Missouri is", "15:08", "getting a thousand bucks you know", "15:09", "Amazon's gonna see some of that because", "15:10", "they're just gonna buy more stuff right", "15:12", "that's true for all of the big companies", "15:14", "what I say to CEOs and I've spoken to", "15:16", "groups of dozens of CEOs what's really", "15:19", "bad for your business is when people", "15:20", "don't have money to spend what's good", "15:22", "your businesses when they do so they're", "15:24", "gonna give up some money at the top and", "15:26", "my thing just gonna end up getting it", "15:27", "back when their consumers end up", "15:30", "spending a bit more it has just been", "15:31", "actually fleshed out like the the real", "15:33", "numbers or the projections of how", "15:35", "we're gonna get back yeah yeah like the", "15:37", "so the Roosevelt Institute studied this", "15:39", "plan of everyone getting a thousand", "15:40", "bucks a month and projected it would", "15:41", "create two million new jobs and grow the",

it", "16:02", "somehow will like facilitate job loss", "16:05", "well for job losses though is the reason", "16:07", "for universal basic income in the first", "16:09", "place right yeah yeah which

who have", "16:34", "gotten pushed out of the workforce so", "16:36", "till again this is not like you know", "16:39", "we're gonna solve a problem that's", "16:40", "coming down the pike like we're actually", "16:41", "in the middle of this problem so if you", "16:44", "put a thousand bucks a month into", "16:46", "people's hands it actually grows the", "16:47", "economy and creates jobs because of more", "16:51", "economic activity now when you say a", "16:53", "problem that's coming down the pike what", "16:55", "what are the projections in terms of", "16:57", "life a timeline yes so there are a lot", "17:02", "of the projections are actually pretty", "17:04", "consistent with each other which means", "17:05", "they're probably right so the so Bane", "17:09", "says you're looking at between 20 and 30", "17:12", "percent of jobs subject to automation by", "17:15", "2030 which is pretty soon it's like 11", "17:17", "years from now McKenzie says about 25", "17:20", "percent the Obama White House literally", "17:24", "like their last day in office they", "17:25", "issued a report saying hey guys we're", "17:27", "gonna automate away all the jobs and", "17:28", "then like you know turn the lights off", "17:31", "they said eighty-three percent of jobs", "17:33", "that make less than twenty dollars an", "17:34", "hour will be subject to automation by", "17:36", "2030 MIT is saying the same thing and so", "17:41", "we have 11 years to try and accelerate", "17:44", "meaningful solutions and this 11 years", "17:47", "it's not like it all happens on", "17:48", "thirty it's gonna happen between now and", "17:50", "then progressively according to all of", "17:53", "the major institutions that have looked", "17:55", "at this now when you take a guy who's", "17:57", "working as a truck driver and he's", "17:58", "making $50,000 a year and you tell him", "18:01", "that automation is gonna take away his", "18:03", "job but good news we're gonna give you", "18:04", "twelve thousand dollars a year that's a", "18:06", "substantial loss in income and yeah it", "18:10", "leaves them in yeah it also leaves them", "18:12", "with this feeling of uselessness or",

"18:24", "it sounds counterintuitive people don't", "18:27", "like free money they like a feeling of", "18:29", "satisfaction of a job well done that", "18:31", "they've created something they've done", "18:33", "something yeah you're a hundred percent", "18:35", "right it's one reason why we call this", "18:36", "the freedom dividend we say look it's", "18:39", "not money for nothing you're an owner", "18:40", "and chair holder of the richest country", "18:43", "in the history of the world just like", "18:44", "when I buy Verizon or Microsoft they", "18:47", "send me a dividend like I don't complain", "18:49", "about that like you're now a shareholder", "18:52", "in this great nation and you get a", "18:54", "dividend but when I was with Dennis the", "18:57", "trucker who owns his

doing other things our", "19:24", "substance abuse goes up our volunteering", "19:27", "and the community goes down even though", "19:29", "we have more time hmm and we generally", "19:31", "spiral into antisocial and", "19:33", "self-destructive behaviors now this is", "19:36", "not something that's experienced by", "19:38", "women in the same levels like women and", "19:41", "joblessness women actually a more", "19:42", "adaptable they're more likely to go back", "19:45", "to school and volunteer they don't spend", "19:47", "all their time on the computers the way", "19:48", "that we do so there's a real problem and", "19:52", "the purpose of universal basic income is", "19:55", "not meant to be a job replacement for", "19:58", "those truckers because right now those", "20:00", "truckers and when I talked to the truck", "20:02", "driver", "20:02", "so I've been campaigning for president", "20:04", "now for a number of months so I spent a", "20:06", "lot of time in Iowa which is a really", "20:07", "huge trucking hub and you go to them and", "20:10", "say hey guys you worried about robot", "20:11", "trucks taking your jobs they're like", "20:12", "there's no way a robot could take my job", "20:14", "like that that's you know that's like", "20:15", "totally matter-of-fact", "20:16", "there like that like this is not", "20:18", "something that they worry about their", "20:21", "attitude has transitioned from that", "20:23", "somewhat - we should make robot trucks", "20:26", "illegal or we should make it so that a", "20:28", "robot truck cannot displace me so that's", "20:32", "been a big shift because a year ago they", "20:34", "were like it's impossible the idea that", "20:38", "a American would say we should make a", "20:41", "robot job illegal like it's we should", "20:44", "have some laws that keep you from being", "20:48", "free to use robots for your business", "20:50", "instead of person like you should be", "20:52", "forced to highly mandatory unionization", "20:55", "or something that sounds pretty", "20:57", "ridiculous well that's where a lot of", "20:59", "them are Joe so only 13% of truckers are", "21:02", "unionized so 87% are like Dennis where", "21:05", "there are small independent firms mhm", "21:07", "and a lot of them actually", "21:09", "bought or leased their own trucks so", "21:12", "they took out tens of thousands of", "21:14", "dollars in the equivalent of a mortgage", "21:15", "to get this truck and so if they have to", "21:18", "compete against a robot truck that", "21:20", "doesn't stop that's like you know that's", "21:23", "existential level stuff yeah and right", "21:25", "now truck drivers have time use", "21:28", "regulations where they cannot drive more", "21:30", "than 14 hours a day so you can't you", "21:33", "literally cannot compete right because", "21:35", "the robot trucks just gonna keep going", "21:36", "our 15 16 17 yeah etc so these guys make", "21:41", "some of them make really good money like", "21:43", "some of them make 70 75 80 thousand", "21:45", "dollars it's one of the higher paying", "21:46", "jobs for men without a you know college", "21:51", "degree and so if you look at what", "21:53", "they're facing it's not so crazy that", "21:55", "they're like hey you need to make the", "21:58", "robots illegal because for them what is", "22:00", "the next best economic alternative if", "22:03", "the robot trucks take over that job like", "22:05", "what they go from yeah it's not crazy", "22:07", "for them but it's a crazy idea to tell a", "22:09", "company that they can't do something", "22:11", "that's more efficient safer than", "22:13", "probably economically more viable", "22:15", "oh yeah again the savings from", "22:17", "automating truck driving are estimated", "22:19", "to be a hundred sixty eight billion", "22:21", "dollars per year and not just labor", "22:24", "savings but also equipment utilization", "22:26", "because the trucks never stop fuel", "22:28", "efficiency because the trucks can", "22:30", "daisy-chain together so there's less", "22:31", "wind resistance mhm fewer accidents", "22:33", "because right now truck accidents kill", "22:36", "about four thousand people a year so you", "22:38", "probably save lives there's a very very", "22:40", "powerful argument for the fact that we", "22:42", "should be trying to automate this stuff", "22:44", "yeah but on the other side you have", "22:45", "literally three and a half million", "22:47", "truckers who rely upon this for their", "22:49", "livelihoods to support their family and", "22:51", "there's gonna be a lot of passion a lot", "22:54", "of resistance to this anyone who thinks", "22:56", "that truck drivers are just gonna shrug", "22:57", "and be like alright I guess I had a good", "22:59", "run I'm just gonna go home and figure it", "23:01", "out that's not gonna be their response", "23:03", "right it's gonna be much more likely", "23:04", "that they say you need to make these", "23:06", "robot trucks illegal or they're just", "23:08", "gonna park their trucks across the", "23:10", "highway get their guns out because a lot", "23:12", "of these guys are ex-military and just", "23:13", "be like hey like I'm not moving my truck", "23:15", "until you know I get my job back and", "23:18", "there'll be a lot of truckers in the", "23:19", "same situation you really think that", "23:21", "would happen well I think we blocked the", "23:23", "highway for their job back that's less", "23:26", "efficient kills more people so I was", "23:28", "with these truckers in the truck stop in", "23:30", "Altoona Iowa and Joe they have really", "23:34", "really difficult jobs I mean I don't", "23:36", "know if you knew truckers where you were", "23:37", "but they're they have this 14 hour", "23:40", "window where they're allowed to drive", "23:41", "their truck and they drive most of that", "23:43", "so they have these other ten hours and", "23:45", "they sleep in their truck the trucks", "23:47", "have a bed they go into the truck stop", "23:49", "they take a shower and there's a laundry", "23:51", "and they're like plugged into this", "23:54", "machine of this truck of an end the", "23:57", "industry you know they spend days", "23:59", "sometimes weeks on the road a lot of", "24:02", "them listen to podcasts probably a lot", "24:04", "of them listening right now a lot of", "24:05", "them listen to podcasts and they're", "24:09", "doing it primarily because it's a more", "24:11", "lucrative opportunity than the other", "24:13", "jobs that are available to them a lot of", "24:15", "them have families that like you know", "24:16", "like supporting their families and so if", "24:20", "you say hey guys like you know times up", "24:22", "for this way of life most of them I", "24:27", "think will not like like", "24:29", "I look at how much they frankly they", "24:31", "like injurer there's so much endurance", "24:33", "baked into that job yeah that I think", "24:36", "most of them will be like some of the", "24:38", "guys you and I know where they're much", "24:39", "more likely to like implode or like you", "24:42", "know do something where where it's", "24:45", "self-destructive than they would be to", "24:47", "take their truck in you know park it", "24:49", "across the highway hmm but you're", "24:51", "talking about a population of hundreds", "24:53", "of thousands including many small", "24:55", "business owners and small business", "24:57", "owners have a different mentality very", "24:59", "often like I've been an entrepreneur I'm", "25:01", "a serial entrepreneur for like last 20", "25:03", "years like you're an entrepreneur and if", "25:05", "you saw this happen you might say hey", "25:07", "I'm adaptable I'll figure it out or you", "25:10", "might say hey I think I can do something", "25:13", "about this like if I park my truck this", "25:16", "way like that's going to cause such", "25:18", "havoc that it's you know it's like", "25:21", "hundreds of millions of dollars worth of", "25:23", "economic harm very very fast and if you", "25:26", "look at the Industrial Revolution which", "25:29", "people cite as the precursor to what", "25:30", "we're going through there were mass", "25:32", "riots in the industrial revolution that", "25:35", "killed dozens of people caused billions", "25:37", "of dollars worth of damage Labor Day is", "25:39", "a holiday today because of those riots", "25:41", "and then we implemented universal high", "25:44", "school in nineteen eleven in part as a", "25:46", "response to these riots so according to", "25:49", "the estimates this is called the fourth", "25:51", "Industrial Revolution and we're going to", "25:53", "displace jobs at three to four times the", "25:56", "rate of that Industrial Revolution and", "25:58", "that Industrial Revolution included mass", "26:01", "riots so thinking that this one will not", "26:04", "strikes me as really really optimistic", "26:07", "and perhaps unrealistic mmm what do you", "26:11", "see coming when when you when you think", "26:14", "that these jobs are going to be", "26:16", "automated and then universal basic", "26:18", "income is going to supplement their in", "26:21", "it's gonna give them some money $1,000 a", "26:23", "month but where do they go from there I", "26:26", "mean how do people exist on twelve", "26:28", "thousand dollars a year like what do", "26:29", "they do like how do they adapt to this", "26:31", "new world right so the first thing you", "26:34", "have to do is you have to look at what", "26:35", "lies ahead if we do nothing right so the", "26:38", "the way it's going to play out is that", "26:40", "self-driving trucks are slowly going to", "26:42", "start Hina", "26:43", "waise amazon's testing them out right", "26:44", "now and the first stage is going to be", "26:47", "that there is a human driver just", "26:48", "sitting there as a fail-safe and the", "26:50", "trucks going to drive itself now my", "26:52", "friends in Silicon Valley are working on", "26:55", "tella operators which is so the trucks", "26:58", "have right now like a 98% accuracy level", "27:01", "which is not very high because you can't", "27:04", "have 2% semi trucks like running into", "27:06", "things so the way they're trying to get", "27:10", "the last percent or so is they're", "27:13", "equipping trucks with tella operating", "27:15", "software which means that a trucker a", "27:17", "tella operator in Nevada or Arizona will", "27:20", "beam into the truck and just be able to", "27:21", "see out the front like a video game like", "27:24", "let you know it's like drone operating", "27:26", "but instead is a truck and right you", "27:28", "beam in and then you just steer the", "27:30", "truck and tell the computers like I got", "27:31", "it from here and then you beam out", "27:32", "that's what they're working on to try", "27:34", "and get catch that last bit of", "27:36", "uncertainty so the innovations are", "27:39", "having it again Joe we're talking about", "27:40", "one hundred sixty eight billion dollars", "27:42", "a year like everything becomes possible", "27:43", "when you're looking at that much money", "27:47", "so in the absence of anyone doing", "27:49", "anything the robot trucks will start", "27:51", "reducing shifts of various truckers I", "27:54", "would say six to ten years from now and", "27:57", "so then there'll be a bunch of reactions", "27:59", "now trucking firms already have massive", "28:04", "shortages they can't find enough people", "28:06", "that's one reason why they're trying to", "28:09", "automate this job as fast as they are", "28:10", "because they're literally like you know", "28:12", "they're short like a couple hundred", "28:14", "thousand truckers right now and people", "28:17", "don't want to go into this field for a", "28:18", "variety of reasons the main thing being", "28:20", "it's like extraordinarily brutal on you", "28:22", "physically very very bad for your family", "28:25", "life - because you're away all the time", "28:26", "yeah something like 88% of truckers have", "28:30", "an early marker for chronic disease like", "28:33", "oh you know like substance abuse", "28:35", "diabetes obesity high blood pressure so", "28:37", "along those lines and now people think", "28:39", "that the jobs going to disappear in the", "28:40", "next five to ten years you can't get", "28:42", "people in so if you play out what", "28:45", "happens when the robot trucks start", "28:46", "reducing shifts then there'll be people", "28:49", "trying to flee the field of trucking and", "28:51", "then if it becomes really dramatic where", "28:54", "the robots start driving let's say", "28:55", "between western", "28:57", "yeah and Nevada and then human beings", "29:00", "get in in those states and then take it", "29:02", "the rest of the way because the robots", "29:04", "won't be reliable enough to drive in", "29:06", "urban areas", "29:07", "they'll be reliable enough to drive on", "29:09", "an interstate but they just have to make", "29:10", "a few decisions then there'll be a", "29:14", "massive depletion of truck driving", "29:16", "opportunities and then in my mind a lot", "29:20", "of suicides a lot of self destruction", "29:22", "and I don't say that lightly I say that", "29:25", "based upon the fact that that's what", "29:26", "happened the manufacturing workers where", "29:28", "if you unpack what happened to the", "29:29", "manufacturing workers of Michigan Ohio", "29:32", "Indiana suicide rates spiked to a point", "29:36", "where now our life expectancy as a", "29:37", "country has declined for the last three", "29:39", "years because of suicides and drug", "29:41", "overdoses it's the first time that's", "29:43", "happened since the great flu pandemic of", "29:46", "1918 like we are actually coming apart", "29:48", "as a country by the numbers so what", "29:51", "happened to the manufacturing workers", "29:52", "will then happen to the trucker's but at", "29:55", "a even more dramatic scale so you'll see", "29:58", "truckers going home and drinking", "30:00", "themselves to death or doing drugs and", "30:03", "overdosing or killing themselves and", "30:06", "then eventually there'll be an outbreak", "30:08", "of violence because some truckers will", "30:10", "say instead of killing myself how about", "30:12", "I go bust up a robot truck and there are", "30:14", "already truckers that are doing things", "30:17", "like blocking Tesla recharging stations", "30:19", "and electronic vehicle battery stations", "30:22", "because they don't like electronic", "30:23", "trucks sword", "30:25", "those are pickup trucks though those are", "30:27", "assholes I mean this is not like people", "30:29", "doing it because they they think that", "30:31", "these tesla recharge stations are taking", "30:33", "jobs away they're just being dickheads", "30:35", "exactly Jo so if you're gonna be a", "30:38", "dickhead even though it really has", "30:40", "nothing to do with you right imagine", "30:42", "when you actually think your livelihood", "30:44", "is being threatened then you can see it", "30:46", "getting revved up you know to like a", "30:48", "much higher level yeah so so I'm running", "30:52", "for president in large part because I", "30:53", "think we need to get in front of this", "30:55", "set of problems we have to say look if", "30:57", "we're gonna save a hundred sixty eight", "30:59", "billion dollars a year maybe some of", "31:01", "that should go to the truckers and give", "31:03", "them a soft landing maybe we should have", "31:06", "this universal basic income where", "31:07", "everyone feels like they're getting a", "31:09", "thousand bucks a month which is", "31:10", "out-of-work replacement it's not gonna", "31:11", "make their lives easy they still need to", "31:13", "work but at least it takes the edge off", "31:16", "it takes like the existential threat off", "31:19", "and also their kids getting it so they", "31:21", "feel like okay my kid actually has some", "31:23", "kind of path to the future and it's not", "31:24", "like if I lose this trucking job not", "31:27", "only am I going to you know struggle and", "31:29", "suffer but my kid will too so my plan as", "31:33", "president is to install a trucker", "31:35", "transitions are and say look it is your", "31:39", "job to try and manage this transition", "31:40", "for the three and a half million", "31:42", "truckers in Joe we haven't even talked", "31:44", "about the five million Americans who", "31:46", "work at truckstops motels diners retail", "31:51", "establishments all the places where the", "31:53", "truckers stop every day just to get out", "31:56", "eat a meal and you know like live a life", "31:58", "I mean if you imagine those communities", "32:01", "when the trucks don't stop there's gonna", "32:04", "be a drying up of economic vitality on a", "32:07", "level that's unprecedented in many of", "32:10", "these communities this is something that", "32:12", "I I'm just becoming aware of over the", "32:14", "last year or two how when when you are", "32:17", "out on the campaign trail and you know", "32:19", "you're talking to media and you're", "32:21", "discussing this with people how many", "32:23", "people have no idea that this is coming", "32:26", "well what I say to people Joe is I say", "32:28", "have you noticed store is closing on", "32:30", "your Main Street and then they say yes", "32:32", "and I asked them why is that", "32:33", "and then they reflect for a minute and", "32:35", "then they say Amazon and I'm like yeah", "32:37", "that's right it was getting twenty", "32:40", "billion dollars of commerce every year", "32:41", "and it's now tipping your malls and Main", "32:44", "Street stories into oblivion you know", "32:45", "and like is that gonna get better or", "32:47", "worse because so some people say it's", "32:49", "like hobb the robots like the robots are", "32:51", "yours away and then you're like no it's", "32:52", "not robots actually like walking around", "32:54", "your neighborhood I mean of course", "32:56", "that's unlikely but Amazon soaking up", "32:59", "the business that used to go to your", "33:00", "mall if you go to their fulfillment", "33:03", "center it's robots as far as the eye can", "33:05", "see if you go to their their warehouse", "33:09", "you know it's also robots as far as far", "33:11", "as the eye can see so when you ask how", "33:13", "aware are people that this is happening", "33:15", "it's one of those truths that as soon as", "33:17", "you pointed out they're like oh yeah", "33:19", "like I I knew that was what was up it's", "33:22", "just for whatever reason I'm like the", "33:24", "only person just laying out the facts", "33:26",

"about that number two we should study", "50:48", "that we cannot talk about that was", "50:50", "that's verbatim really yeah and why were", "50:52", "they saying that because it seems", "50:54", "alarmist like anti-progress or like you", "50:58", "know you're like you know throwing", "51:00", "stones at like like big tech companies", "51:04", "and it's like I'm not throwing stones at",

the point you made", "51:14", "originally which was we must educate and", "51:15", "retrain Americans for the jobs of the", "51:17", "future and then when I was like hey", "51:19", "we're terrible at that by the numbers", "51:21", "yeah", "51:22", "then they'd literally be like well I", "51:23", "guess we'll learn to get better at it", "51:24", "then and then I so I came back to my", "51:27", "home in New York City and I was like oh", "51:29", "my gosh like we are so backward and far", "51:32", "gone as certainly as a government and so", "51:36", "then I was grappling with it and I'm a",

"55:22", "have to be 35 years or older check and", "55:24", "then the second is natural-born citizen", "55:25", "check only rules that's it so then you", "55:28", "get into the process and you say okay", "55:30", "the first two states to vote are Iowa", "55:32", "and New Hampshire now they're gonna be", "55:35", "about 20 people running for president as", "55:36", "a Democrat this cycle you

it", "55:58", "250,000 but if you have 20 candidates to", "56:02", "finish top three in a field at twenty", "56:04", "you probably need about 40 to 50,000", "56:08", "Iowans to get on board so you say

and I'm", "56:25", "sure they would agree with you the", "56:27", "question is what are the other thing you", "56:29", "know see I don't think most people are", "56:31", "aware that this is coming and I think", "56:34", "you people and explaining all these", "56:37", "statistics and seeing the forecast", "56:39", "particularly from your position as a", "56:40", "serial entrepreneur who has a deep",

"56:52", "maybe logically but they have different", "56:54", "concerns so how do you address these", "56:57", "other concerns like I bet if you polled", "57:00", "people what are the issues what are the", "57:02", "issues in this upcoming 2020", "57:04", "presidential race that you know who's", "57:06", "going to beat Donald Trump how do you do", "57:08", "it", "57:08", "this is like on the

Republican side obviously it's", "57:21", "Trump unless someone comes along or he", "57:23", "goes to jail those are the two", "57:24", "possibilities", "57:25", "yeah what are the other issues and that", "57:30", "you feel that people are really", "57:32", "concerned about that you can perhaps", "57:35", "shed some unique light on sure so the", "57:38", "the three big policy as I'm running on", "57:40", "are one the freedom dividend because a", "57:42", "lot of Americans are seeing their", "57:44", "paychecks not keep up with their", "57:45", "expenses number two is we need to get", "57:47", "health care off the backs of businesses", "57:50", "and families and move towards a", "57:52", "single-payer system", "57:53", "medicare-for-all because as an", "57:56", "entrepreneur it makes it

businesses because", "58:04", "they're concerned about keeping their", "58:06", "health care for their families so we got", "58:08", "to get health care off the backs of", "58:09", "businesses and families and trying to", "58:11", "make the economy more dynamic and we", "58:13", "spend twice as much on health care as", "58:15", "other countries do to worst results like", "58:17", "it's right now we're in like the worst", "58:18", "of all worlds and the third thing is and", "58:22", "I referenced my wife when I talk about", "58:24", "this my wife is at home with our two", "58:26", "boys six and three one of whom is", "58:27", "autistic and when I say is like what is", "58:30", "her work value that in GDP and then", "58:33", "people think about and I like I don't", "58:34", "know and I'm like zero GDP like doesn't", "58:37", "consider that actual economic", "58:39", "contribution and then I say we have to", "58:42", "do is we have to actually evolve from", "58:44", "GDP as a measuring stick because it", "58:47", "actually doesn't work for us it's almost", "58:49", "a hundred years old we made it up during", "58:51", "the Great Depression self-driving trucks", "58:53", "are gonna drive GDP way up but it's", "58:55", "gonna be very very bad for many people", "58:57", "and communities so we have to actually", "58:58", "change the measuring sticks to something", "59:00", "that would actually make our economy", "59:02", "work for us make it so that the market", "59:05", "serves us instead of all us being inputs", "59:07", "to the market because if we're all", "59:09", "inputs to the market we lose to robots", "59:10", "in AI hands down and it's not like it", "59:14", "doesn't matter if you were like a really", "59:15", "conscientious hard-working truck driver", "59:18", "like a really lazy sloppy it doesn't", "59:20", "matter like you know doesn't matter if", "59:21", "you were like a really diligent", "59:22", "radiologist or like it doesn't matter so", "59:25", "we have to shift the markets emphasis to", "59:28", "actually fuel our well-being and change", "59:31", "from GDP which is again this archaic", "59:33", "measurement we made up to to things that", "59:35", "would actually correspond to how we're", "59:37", "doing things like health how childhood", "59:39", "success rates environmental how do you", "59:41", "quantify that how do you how would you", "59:42", "quantify that in a way that would be", "59:45", "translatable to the average voter yeah", "59:48", "so we have measurements for most of", "59:49", "these things and and again if you look", "59:51", "at our numbers right now you'd see it's", "59:53", "like what like how many people listen", "59:55", "with this know that America's life", "59:56", "expectancy has declined for the last", "59:57", "three years you know that to me would be", "59:59", "like a pretty important measurement but", "60:01", "you think that's because of is it", "60:03", "because the suicide is it because of", "60:05", "drug overdoses", "60:06", "because of obesity diet what is it", "60:10", "the the two causes that people point to", "60:13", "the most are that drug overdoses and", "60:15", "suicides have overtaken vehicular deaths", "60:17", "as as the most frequent deaths in the", "60:21", "United States I didn't know that suicide", "60:22", "was Lois I knew that drug overdose had", "60:24", "taken obesity but suicides of overtaking", "60:27", "obesity as well suicides have overtaken", "60:29", "car accidents I'm not sure about it I'm", "60:32", "sorry I meant I meant car accidents I", "60:33", "misspoke so car accidents used to be", "60:37", "number one yeah", "60:38", "suicides are higher than car accidents", "60:40", "now yeah so suicides drug overdoses and", "60:46", "then car accidents like or suicides and", "60:49", "drug overdoses like I think drug", "60:51", "overdose is number one number one and", "60:52", "then suicides number two Wow", "60:55", "and so that's why life expectancy has", "60:57", "declined for all and you think that the", "60:58", "Tsuen very much likely there's at least", "61:01", "some of the number of the suicides are", "61:03", "related to economic disparity oh yeah I", "61:07", "mean if you look at the suicide rate in", "61:08", "it's particularly pronounced in 50 to 50", "61:12", "year old", "61:12", "50 to 54 year old white Americans which", "61:15", "are the population I mean you resemble", "61:17", "that that's me", "61:18", "yeah that's you which resembles the", "61:20", "population that right now is just", "61:21", "reaching a point where they're like hey", "61:23", "my job skills don't have any you know", "61:26", "like utility in the marketplace and then", "61:29", "they go home and they just like you know", "61:30", "start looking around and being like what", "61:32", "am i doing I mean it's it's really dark", "61:34", "it's punitive it's punishing and we've", "61:37", "put our citizens in the situation where", "61:39", "we all see ourselves as economic inputs", "61:42", "what the market says we're worth is what", "61:44", "we're worth and if we're worth less then", "61:47", "it's our fault and so the next move is", "61:49", "to say okay I guess you know this place", "61:51", "there's no place for me here I don't", "61:53", "mean it sounds skeptical but I just", "61:55", "don't believe that a thousand dollars in", "61:58", "a month is gonna fix that it seems like", "62:01", "that would be a good thing", "62:04", "certainly not moving in the wrong", "62:06", "direction certainly moving in the right", "62:08", "direction but it seems that there needs", "62:09", "to be some sort of a massive rethinking", "62:12", "of civilization itself if you're gonna", "62:15", "have that many things that are going to", "62:18", "be automated and that many people are", "62:19", "going to be out of", "62:20", "and feeling that the world that they", "62:23", "prepared for no longer exists yes it", "62:27", "seems like we need a step further", "62:29", "another move a hundred percent brother", "62:32", "and that's one reason why the freedom", "62:34", "dividends not like us like a that", "62:36", "doesn't solve the problem right the", "62:37", "problem is fundamentally one of", "62:39", "reconstituting means of structure", "62:42", "purpose and fulfillment in people's", "62:45", "lives particularly in men's lives right", "62:47", "how do we do that", "62:48", "right so one important aspect of that is", "62:51", "to actually start measuring how we are", "62:54", "doing as a society and saying that's", "62:57", "actually where we're trying to go so", "62:59", "instead of using GDP using some sort of", "63:02", "other quantifiable method of measuring", "63:05", "health and happiness and fulfillment yes", "63:08", "levels of engagement with work hmm in", "63:12", "mental health I mean you can we have", "63:14", "measurements for that we are", "63:15", "sophisticated enough to do that and then", "63:17", "if we say then as president I'm gonna be", "63:20", "up there in 2021 being like oh here's", "63:21", "the state of the union here's like the", "63:23", "data and then we're gonna say you don't", "63:24", "want to try and do we're actually going", "63:25", "to try and move those measurements in", "63:27", "the right direction so let's try and get", "63:29", "drug overdoses down by 50% in two years", "63:33", "let's try and get our mental health up a", "63:35", "little bit like in in these ways and", "63:37", "then make it so that that person who's", "63:40", "at home being like okay like you know", "63:42", "like there's not a job for me I'm", "63:44", "getting a thousand bucks a month that", "63:46", "does not solve all my problems it takes", "63:48", "the edge off but then we can hopefully", "63:50", "start reconstituting what that person's", "63:54", "purpose is in their community in their", "63:57", "neighborhood and so one of the things", "64:00", "that I'm going to point out is that if", "64:02", "you pump a thousand bucks a month into", "64:03", "that neighborhood it ends up creating a", "64:07", "whole new rung of opportunities for the", "64:09", "people in that community like some of", "64:12", "that money goes to you know like youth", "64:15", "leagues and churches and nonprofits and", "64:19", "creates jobs right there in that", "64:21", "community one of the examples I use is", "64:23", "like if you're in a town in Missouri", "64:24", "with 50,000 people and let's say you", "64:26", "really like to bake but starting a", "64:28", "bakery is a dumb idea because people", "64:30", "just do not have money in that town to", "64:32", "buy your baked goods but then I pump see", "64:34", "ten million dollars a year into that", "64:36", "economy and a lot of that just", "64:38", "circulates right there in that town then", "64:41", "if I start a bakery it's a good idea and", "64:44", "I know if my bakery fails I'm not going", "64:46", "to die I can at least go home and get my", "64:48", "dividend and then if I go to other", "64:50", "people and say hey you want to like help", "64:51", "me out with this then they also think", "64:53", "it's a better idea than they would have", "64:54", "so the money is not the solution the", "64:57", "money helps set the stage for the", "65:00", "solutions and so does the measurements", "65:02", "so does if you because right now if like", "65:04", "you don't even know that your life", "65:05", "expectancy is declining that's kind of", "65:07", "hard to solve that problem so if you say", "65:09", "look this is actually how we measure how", "65:11", "we're doing and then you go in and say", "65:13", "okay like local government NGO", "65:16", "entrepreneur because right now like our", "65:18", "entrepreneurs", "65:19", "none of our entrepreneurs are working on", "65:21", "trying to make that dudes life better", "65:23", "you know it's like that's not only do so", "65:25", "much most entrepreneurs are just trying", "65:27", "to succeed I mean it's very difficult to", "65:29", "start a business right and actually have", "65:31", "it work out well the the idea that", "65:33", "they're gonna look out for truck drivers", "65:35", "yeah it's not realistic but it at least", "65:38", "we can start moving ourselves in that", "65:40", "general direction if we start because as", "65:43", "a CEO you know this you make what you", "65:45", "measure mm you're not measuring it you", "65:46", "have no chance right if you start", "65:48", "measuring it you at least start to open", "65:50", "up the chance but what you're saying is", "65:53", "the most profound which is like we need", "65:54", "to reconstitute meaning for many many", "65:57", "Americans yeah and that's what to me the", "66:00", "most destructive aspect of that you know", "66:03", "again like the mental health indicators", "66:05", "and like the suicides and the rest of it", "66:07", "is like there's a real loss of meaning", "66:09", "for many many people here in this", "66:11", "country well obviously we're talking", "66:13", "about a large scale but if you go back", "66:16", "to the time before trucks and truck", "66:19", "drivers that was not a viable occupation", "66:22", "it wasn't something people did but yet", "66:24", "they still found a way to occupy their", "66:25", "time do you think that there needs to be", "66:28", "some sort of an education and some some", "66:31", "sort of a method of explaining to young", "66:34", "people in particular that you have to", "66:37", "think of something to do because most of", "66:40", "the things that you think you can do", "66:41", "won't exist so we have to think of what", "66:45", "are the other possibilities and be", "66:47", "creative", "66:47", "and do something with your life that", "66:49", "only a human being can do which is a", "66:53", "really weird way to think about it", "66:55", "because most of the things you used to", "66:57", "be able to think that a human being", "66:58", "could do for a living are now going to", "67:00", "be done by robots", "67:01", "but I don't think I think there's a", "67:04", "giant gap between the understanding that", "67:06", "you have and the understanding that the", "67:08", "average person has and this could be

"71:54", "kind of weird because like as far as I", "71:56", "can tell there's been no massive quality", "71:58", "change and the reason is that they've", "72:00", "hired a lot of administrators it has not", "72:02", "gone to faculty it has not gone to", "72:04", "facilities it has gone to just", "72:06", "administrative excess and bloat and then", "72:09", "say okay you can do whatever you want",

to", "72:18", "federal loans you have to bring your", "72:19", "administrator to student ratio in line", "72:22", "with what it was like in the 1990s and", "72:27", "then the schools would scream bloody", "72:29", "murder they'd be like I can't do that", "72:30", "that's impossible you're like well I", "72:32", "have a feeling you're gonna figure it", "72:33", "out start bringing it down and you would", "72:37", "realize it doesn't impact the student", "72:38", "experience at all like and I understand", "72:41", "it because I've run a large nonprofit", "72:44", "organization that it

deans of", "72:52", "everything but then over time that ends", "72:54", "up building a very large cost structure", "72:56", "that gets passed along to the public so", "72:59", "you'd bring the costs down now you said", "73:01", "before Bernie's like free college for", "73:03", "everyone the problem with that solution", "73:04", "is it pretends that college solves the", "73:07", "employment problems of young people and", "73:09", "anyone who's coming out of college knows", "73:10", "that that's not real the underemployment", "73:13", "rate for recent college graduates today", "73:14",

job and has", "74:12", "automation kicks in this is obviously", "74:15", "gonna bottleneck it's gonna get even", "74:16", "it's gonna give him worse yeah yeah", "74:18", "completely so the ideal is that you end", "74:21", "up training young people to be really", "74:23", "really adaptable and and have low cost", "74:25", "structures and just be able to you know", "74:27", "become entrepreneurs and I spent seven", "74:29", "years trying to train young people to do", "74:30", "just that but one of the things I've", "74:32", "discovered is that we're over", "74:33", "emphasizing college and what we're under", "74:36", "emphasizing is technical vocational and", "74:38", "apprenticeship work because a lot of", "74:40", "that work believe it or not it's", "74:41", "actually really hard to automate like", "74:43", "you know we're not gonna automate an air", "74:45", "conditioning repair person I'm a mom or", "74:46", "anytime soon and for sure craftsmen", "74:49", "people who build

in technical or vocational", "74:58", "training in Germany that's fifty nine", "75:00", "percent give you a sense of what the gap", "75:03", "can mean so what we're doing is we're", "75:05", "over prescribing college we're saying", "75:06", "college college college for everyone", "75:08", "it's not really working that well and", "75:09", "then we're still treating people who are", "75:12", "working in trades and everything is", "75:13", "somehow you know like not in great", "75:17", "careers when a lot of those careers are", "75:18", "actually really awesome and they pay", "75:20", "great and they people enjoy them they're", "75:22", "persistent so right now we're gonna", "75:24", "automate away it's a lot easier to", "75:26", "automate all away a lot of repetitive", "75:28", "cognitive work than it is a non", "75:31", "repetitive manual work mmm because like", "75:34", "actual robot digits you know it's like", "75:36", "because if you can imagine what it would", "75:38", "take to ever robot plumber like come in", "75:39", "your house", "75:40", "that stuff's really really tricky yeah", "75:43", "there's a lot of fine motor work they", "75:44", "have to like unscrew pipes and like", "75:45", "stuff that stuff's not gonna get", "75:47", "automated for a long time you know what", "75:49", "is gonna get automated a lot of like", "75:51", "entry-level cognitive tasks a lot of", "75:53", "journalism tasks a lot of bookkeeping a", "75:55", "lot of stuff that college graduates", "75:56", "think they're gonna get a job in and", "75:59", "then those jobs are gonna

then like the", "76:17", "the legal jobs are not going to be there", "76:18", "for him it's often the problem of their", "76:20", "parents giving them pressure to go into", "76:22", "college as well because they didn't want", "76:23", "the kid to become a loser and if the kid", "76:25", "you know like where I grew up in Boston", "76:27", "if you went into the trades if you", "76:29", "abandoned

were fucked yeah I mean it's", "76:49", "it's so common it's so common that they", "76:51", "thought there was going to be this path", "76:52", "and this path just didn't exist once", "76:56", "they got out or it was far far more", "76:58", "difficult than was then they were led to", "77:00", "believe yeah if you look at it about 32", "77:02", "percent of Americans graduated from", "77:03", "college right now and that level has", "77:05", "been more or less constant for a long", "77:07", "time", "77:07", "it's not like hey I've got another 20", "77:09", "percent I could get into college like", "77:11", "right now the college completion rate in", "77:13", "six years is about 59 percent so like", "77:16", "four out of ten people who start college", "77:17", "or not graduating in six

and this is one", "77:29", "reason why I'm so into the freedom", "77:31", "dividend instead of something like free", "77:32", "college because why would you subsidize", "77:34", "something that only the top third of the", "77:35", "population is gonna use you know and end", "77:38", "it's a highly inefficient costly system", "77:40", "anyway like money into that you're much", "77:42", "better off putting a thousand bucks a", "77:44", "month into every 18 year olds hands then", "77:46", "if they go to college great colleges", "77:48", "partially paid for they go to trade", "77:50", "school great trade schools partially", "77:51", "paid for they start their own business", "77:53", "they do something career", "77:54", "like they want to do something to help", "77:55", "that's great too like you can actually", "77:58", "start building more varied paths and", "78:00", "make it so that people don't feel like I", "78:01", "need to get into this institution or", "78:03", "else my life is going to be over now", "78:05", "what are the primary concerns that", "78:06", "people have outside of what you're", "78:08", "talking about so far with automation", "78:10", "taking away jobs and and you know", "78:13", "student loan debt and these things what", "78:15", "are the other things you think you're", "78:16", "gonna have to talk about in order to get", "78:17", "people to take you really seriously you", "78:20", "know I mean the hot-button issues you", "78:21", "know what they all are it's like", "78:22", "immigration and climate change is a", "78:25", "really big one and you know I mean I can", "78:28", "talk about those at length so my father", "78:31", "and mother met as immigrants from Taiwan", "78:33", "at UC Berkeley my father is a PhD in", "78:36", "physics he generated 69 US patents for", "78:39", "GE and IBM over his career so I'd like", "78:42", "immigrants are awesome immigrants come", "78:43", "in and you know it's like big stuff", "78:46", "happened for big American companies so", "78:49", "I'm very Pro immigrant and I think", "78:51", "people would expect that just to look at", "78:52", "me and so what I say is first it makes", "78:55", "no sense to educate international", "78:57", "students and US universities and then", "78:59", "send them home to compete against us", "79:00", "that makes no sense like if they're", "79:02", "gonna come to the u.s. and study we", "79:03", "should just staple a green card to their", "79:04", "diploma and be like hey you got a", "79:06", "diploma great news you can stay here and", "79:08", "work mmm as I personally know tons of", "79:11", "awesome internationals who would", "79:12", "definitely help make the u.s. more", "79:15", "dynamic and competitive that go home and", "79:18", "start the companies there and you're", "79:18", "like oh no like how that happens right", "79:21", "that's great for people who come from a", "79:23", "privileged background", "79:24", "yeah the opportunity to come here and", "79:26", "become educated but what about people", "79:29", "who are poor or trying to make it here", "79:31", "from South America yah Tamala", "79:33", "so school there are three paths", "79:35", "available to you for the approximately", "79:37", "12 million people who are here", "79:38", "undocumented many of whom from Mexico", "79:40", "and Latin America would not like that", "79:42", "you know frankly like they're not the", "79:45", "profile I just described for the most", "79:46", "part so there are three approaches", "79:49", "number one is you can pretend to deport", "79:50", "them because it's completely unfeasible", "79:52", "to deport 12 million people I mean like", "79:54", "whole regional economies would collapse", "79:56", "like you can't do matically like it", "79:58", "doesn't make any sense right number two", "80:01", "is you do nothing which is our current", "80:05", "path and then you have massive problems", "80:07", "- because there", "80:08", "constantly interacting with your schools", "80:10", "and your hospitals and getting into car", "80:12", "accidents and like you know it's like", "80:13", "just not knowing who the heck is who is", "80:15", "an untenable situation for any advanced", "80:18", "society so number three is you create a", "80:21", "pathway to citizenship and then you", "80:23", "integrate them into society but it's", "80:25", "like a long-term path that takes a", "80:27", "number of years and you need to keep", "80:29", "your nose clean and pay taxes and work", "80:32", "hard and do that seems to me the most", "80:34", "feasible yeah and so that's where we", "80:36", "should go and some Republicans were on", "80:38", "board with that until they like you know", "80:40", "paid a political price and then they ran", "80:41", "the other direction so that is really", "80:43", "the right path for people who are here", "80:47", "undocumented but I say to people a lot", "80:50", "that the opposite of Donald Trump is an", "80:52", "Asian guy who likes math so Donald", "80:57", "Trump's like build a wall and I'm like", "80:58", "look like I mean I'm we ought to enforce", "81:00", "a strong border like especially in a", "81:03", "world where everyone every citizens", "81:04", "getting a thousand bucks a month", "81:05", "like you got enforce it strong border", "81:06", "right at the same time you know like", "81:08", "people who are here they're making our", "81:11", "communities a lot more entrepreneurial", "81:13", "dynamic many of them mean at the high", "81:15", "end half of the Silicon Valley", "81:17", "entrepreneurs or other immigrants or", "81:18", "children of immigrants and that's true", "81:21", "in a different way in terms of like the", "81:23", "dynamism of these immigrant communities", "81:25", "so what I say to people is like if I'm", "81:27", "president people will see that you come", "81:30", "to this country and you work hard your", "81:31", "son or daughter can become president", "81:32", "United States now what do you do though", "81:35", "in this scenario that you just", "81:37", "subscribed if someone comes here and", "81:39", "they don't work hard and they don't keep", "81:42", "their nose clean and they are still here", "81:44", "and they're not a citizen yet yeah so", "81:47", "you know so then then they operate in", "81:49", "the informal economy in the way that", "81:51", "they have and that the truth is that", "81:53", "even if we have this pathway there gonna", "81:55", "be a significant proportion of people", "81:56", "who just do not trust us enough say hey", "81:59", "I'm here and I'm gonna like get in the", "82:01", "pipeline there's gonna be a lot of there", "82:03", "gonna be a lot of people that don't", "82:06", "subscribe but that's where it is right", "82:10", "now we're not making the situation", "82:11", "actively worse you know we can at least", "82:13", "improve the situation for a really", "82:15", "significant proportion of them yeah for", "82:18", "a significant proportion of them and you", "82:20", "know the other situation would be", "82:21", "tax revenue how many people that are", "82:24", "here illegally you're not paying taxes I", "82:26", "would imagine it's a enormous number", "82:28", "yeah there'd be a real economic boost if", "82:30", "we can integrate them into the formal", "82:31", "economy because there's a lot of just", "82:33", "cash going back and forth right thing is", "82:36", "it a lot of people might decide hey you", "82:38", "know what I don't even want to be a", "82:39", "citizen because if I'm a citizen I have", "82:41", "to pay taxes or I could work as a", "82:43", "laborer or work as a you know on", "82:46", "construction sites or whatever whoever's",
