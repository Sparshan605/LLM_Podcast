the", "00:24", "weirdness of like interviewing with", "00:27", "people and they're like you know and you", "00:28", "know you could die is this scary yeah", "00:31", "yeah that's all right though I mean the", "00:33", "thing yeah it's funny touring with the", "00:35", "film we've been doing queue days every", "00:36", "night you get the same questions from", "00:37", "the audience all the time you know and", "00:38", "part of that is tiring but then part of", "00:40", "it like people ask some questions", "00:41", "because they're obvious because", "00:43", "everybody wants to know this is things", "00:45", "and I'm like I understand that one of", "00:46", "the weirdest parts of the film is when", "00:48", "they're showing all the guys who have", "00:51", "died from free soloing and they're yeah", "00:54", "though actually they didn't all die free", "00:56", "soloing oh that's actually one of the", "00:57", "that's probably the only thing that I", "00:59", "take slight issue at the film it's", "01:01", "slightly hyperbolic is two of them dead", "01:03", "BASE jumping and one of them tightrope", "01:05", "champagne they all were free soulless", "01:07", "which is kind of what

you're doing something that's a", "01:59", "little bit easier you relax I think", "02:01", "that's probably part of it but also I", "02:02", "think part of it is just a numbers thing", "02:04", "you spend so much time doing easy stuff", "02:05", "and so little time doing really hard", "02:07", "stuff mmm that you know it's just", "02:09", "districts", "02:11", "how much how important is it when when", "02:14", "you're free soloing to have that edge to", "02:16", "be like really talk cognizant about how", "02:19", "intense this is like if you got to calm", "02:22", "to relaxed no I think that's I think", "02:24", "that is kind of the concern for sure and", "02:26", "I've noticed that in for myself anyway", "02:29", "and I try not to do very much easy", "02:31", "soloing anymore because there is a", "02:32", "certain complacency that over time you", "02:35", "know you just do so much mileage on easy", "02:37", "terrain and then you're like this is so", "02:38", "easy this is so easy and then you slip", "02:40", "and you die well you know you know", "02:44", "fighters look at things that way too", "02:46", "like they did a certain point in their", "02:48", "life they don't want easy fights because", "02:50", "they need to get challenged otherwise", "02:52", "they won't train properly and then they", "02:54", "wind up losing yeah you should take it", "02:56", "seriously yeah well the difference", "02:57", "between a fighter say when they're not", "03:00", "trained and not in camp and just their", "03:03", "skill and what their body can do without", "03:05", "without going through a camp it's", "03:07", "probably only like 70% of what they are", "03:10", "when they actually go through everything", "03:13", "with full intensity eight we order two", "03:17", "times a day you know physical therapy", "03:20", "massage visualization conditioning all", "03:25", "the other things that make them who they", "03:27", "are the day they step into the cage like", "03:29",

is", "03:48", "there any concern that maybe you haven't", "03:51", "given yourself enough recuperative time", "03:53", "like for the day of know what so for me", "03:56", "anyway it was always sort of the", "03:57", "opposite because the real challenge of", "03:59", "free soloing is the psychological side", "04:00", "the mental side of it it's not so much", "04:02", "the physical like I don't necessarily", "04:03", "have to physically perform it the", "04:06", "absolute limit of what I'm capable of", "04:07", "but I have to mentally perform at that", "04:09", "level and so and the mental side of it", "04:11", "comes so much from confidence and", "04:13", "feeling you know feeling prepared", "04:15", "mm-hm and so I don't know so when I when", "04:18", "I free solid I'll cap I kind of knew", "04:19", "that I wasn't actually like I'd probably", "04:22", "already started to decline a little bit", "04:23", "physically over the course of the season", "04:25", "the two months and he

kind of realized that I", "04:33", "was starting to get sort of deeply 15 I", "04:35", "was sort of a week away from like having", "04:37", "started a slump like no I'm kind of", "04:39", "pooped but the thing is I knew that that", "04:42", "because of all that preparation you know", "04:44", "psychologically I was as good as I was", "04:46", "ever gonna be so even if I was", "04:47", "physically starting to be a little bit", "04:48", "tired it's like time to you know it's", "04:51", "kind of the different curves you have to", "04:53", "hit it right at the right moment now is", "04:55", "your

about", "05:44", "thousands via air and you're like stop", "05:47", "thinking about chalk and powder and and", "05:49", "that shit like that have you ever gone", "05:56", "to like a sports psychologist or have", "05:58", "you ever like actively tried to", "06:02", "coordinate a program from mental", "06:04", "training or anything like that no not", "06:07", "really I mean so with with free selling", "06:09", "I'll cap I found that I needed to create", "06:13", "enough space for it's not so much mental", "06:15", "training but um but create enough empty", "06:17", "time so that I had so that I was able to", "06:20", "sort of process so I don't I sorted like", "06:23", "stopped running email I erased my social", "06:25", "media like sort of freed up my life and", "06:27", "then actually my girlfriend left was", "06:29", "sort of the week ahead of time so that", "06:30", "was just totally by myself and my band", "06:32", "with nothing going on like no", "06:33", "distractions and so that's not exactly", "06:35", "you know mental training but it was", "06:38", "giving myself", "06:39", "the free time that I could just sit", "06:41", "around and think about things you know I", "06:42", "could process like it in my own terms in", "06:44", "my own time when was the last time we", "06:46", "talked how many years ago was that it's", "06:48", "so long at least for right oh no it's", "06:51", "like six or seven I was it I think so I", "06:54", "think it's like 2012 or something during", "06:56", "that time how much has changed in your", "06:58", "life in terms of the way people perceive", "07:00", "what you do and the amount of attention", "07:02", "that you get I would imagine that having", "07:05", "that alone time now yeah it's much", "07:07", "harder yeah yeah no totally it's it's", "07:10", "funny I mean I've tried to not let my", "07:12", "life get busy over time but it just sort", "07:14", "of naturally happens I mean well with", "07:15", "success yeah exactly there's some one", "07:17", "more times you and yeah when I was", "07:20", "reached out to you I reached out to you", "07:21", "a couple times but I was like this guy", "07:23", "is probably getting fucked with all the", "07:25", "time like someone's probably always", "07:27", "poking at you and you're just trying to", "07:28", "get a foothold hold on no I mean no I", "07:33", "mean I appreciate all the opportunities", "07:35", "that have now and you know I mean I'm", "07:37", "very happy with the way my life has", "07:39", "changed over time but certainly when I", "07:42", "look back at ten or twelve years ago and", "07:43", "I was just a single 20 year old man", "07:46", "living in a car like I had nothing going", "07:48", "on you know if if I had like one", "07:50", "interview in a month I'd be like well", "07:52", "it's a big month for media you know and", "07:54", "then now on a film tour it's like", "07:55", "completely outrageous it's totally an", "07:57", "other end of the spectrum now when you", "08:00", "do in this film - when does the film", "08:01", "actually come out the films like out", "08:03", "it's in theaters so you can go see right", "08:05", "now but you can't get on iTunes oh yeah", "08:07", "yeah so so it did a month of festival", "08:10", "circuit and you know earlier in the end", "08:13", "of the summer and then it came out in", "08:15", "theaters at the end of September so it's", "08:17", "right now I think this weekend is its", "08:18", "widest release it's like 400 theaters", "08:20", "all over the country right now", "08:21", "Wow but and then in theory it's through", "08:25", "National Geographic so I think it'll be", "08:26", "on television on the channel at some", "08:28", "point and then eventually they'll stream", "08:29", "somewhere I don't know is it strange all", "08:32", "this attention yeah I mean well I don't", "08:36", "know it's in some ways it's a natural", "08:37", "extension of all the the stuff I've had", "08:39", "over the years you know like having a 60", "08:41", "minutes piece and many years ago", "08:43", "was a bit of a lie was like was a flurry", "08:44", "of attention and so that kind of sort of", "08:47", "prepared me in some ways you know but", "08:49", "yeah I mean it's grimy well you've dealt", "08:50", "with this real life I mean it's", "08:52", "yeah but I'm asking like an interesting", "08:53", "yeah but I feel like it comes with what", "08:56", "I do I'm in show business you know", "08:59", "that's you know the REO is very you're", "09:02", "you're a climber yeah and the most", "09:05", "radical kind of climber well free solo", "09:09", "you think when I think of what you do I", "09:11", "think of quiet tension yeah that's", "09:14", "that's kind of fair yeah because it", "09:15", "should be it should be sort of", "09:17", "meditative and relaxing and quiet but", "09:19", "then obviously you're also sometimes", "09:21", "straining your entire body you know like", "09:23", "trying very hard physically and yeah", "09:26", "well I remember one of the things you", "09:27", "said to me the last time we talked was", "09:29", "that it's it's very mellow because if it", "09:32", "ever gets intense something's gone wrong", "09:35", "yeah no that's that's I still feel", "09:38", "exactly the same way I mean that's yeah", "09:42", "that's always the challenge is to keep", "09:43", "it keep it relaxed but for a guy like", "09:45", "you my perception of a guy like you", "09:48", "who's that that person who's doing that", "09:51", "activity then to sort of juxtapose that", "09:55", "with this media tour type environment", "09:59", "and dealing with all these people that", "10:01", "that seems to me like it would be really", "10:03", "annoying I mean yeah it's very different", "10:07", "than my normal normal lifestyle I guess", "10:09", "but the thing is you know it's sort of", "10:11", "an adventure it's an experience in its", "10:12", "own way I've been I've been kind of", "10:14", "calling it an expedition film tour", "10:15", "because I've done a lot of expeditions", "10:17", "in my life like last winter I went to", "10:19", "Antarctica for a month and and it's not", "10:21", "exactly the type of climbing I'd", "10:22", "normally do and I don't really like", "10:23", "being cold we sort of like oh it is a", "10:25", "once in a lifetime opportunity to go", "10:26", "somewhere you know it was like going to", "10:28", "Mars or something it was this totally", "10:29", "outrageous experience we're climbing big", "10:30", "rock walls on in Antarctica you're just", "10:32", "living on the glacier and it's totally", "10:34", "different totally crazy he camped out on", "10:36", "a glacier", "10:36", "yeah we're just in a tent on a glacier", "10:38", "from my office when you do that how", "10:40", "thick a pad do you use really thick", "10:42", "they're really in a very very thick", "10:45", "sleeping bag warm yeah yeah yeah yeah in", "10:48", "your sleep mat it's a negative 40", "10:49", "degrees sleeping bag I mean it's pretty", "10:50", "good job but but anyway I mean so that", "10:53", "kind of experience you know in some ways", "10:55", "it's very comparable to a film to where", "10:57", "I'm like this is gonna be a", "10:57", "once-in-a-lifetime thing you just", "10:59", "embrace it you go with it you know it's", "11:01", "different than the way you normally", "11:02", "choose to live your life but that kind", "11:03", "of makes it understand you know it's", "11:04", "something", "11:05", "well I could imagine it would be very", "11:07", "interesting yeah the the Antarctica", "11:10", "thing sounds like a trip yeah like were", "11:13", "you traveling on established corridor it", "11:17", "was no no it's what some people had", "11:20", "climbed in the region before but but we", "11:22", "actually did tons the first two sons", "11:23", "like routes and summits that had never", "11:24", "been climbed Wow", "11:26", "yeah it's pretty cool now when you do", "11:28", "something like that do you map it out in", "11:29", "advance like I mean well not really", "11:32", "because I mean they're photos of the", "11:34", "formations and people like I said it", "11:36", "climbed some of them some Norwegians had", "11:39", "sort of pioneer there in written a book", "11:40", "about it", "11:41", "but um but then it's not until you get", "11:43", "there that you can really decide what", "11:45", "you're gonna climb and how it looks I", "11:46", "mean ultimately you have to look at the", "11:47", "rock and see if it's climbing bone so", "11:49", "you basically just have to ski up and", "11:50", "then touch it and see what you can do", "11:51", "and then try to climb it you ski up well", "11:53", "yeah cause even living on a glacier I", "11:55", "mean you have to ski every way Wow it", "11:57", "was cool I I did I did a month wearing", "12:00", "only ski boots or climbing shoes or or", "12:03", "my bedroom slippers are on camp would", "12:05", "you feel like oh no we're in really", "12:09", "thick socks and then keeping everything", "12:11", "as warm as possible but but yeah I mean", "12:13", "we're in climbing shoes and that already", "12:15", "goes pretty chilly yeah actually there's", "12:18", "a film about that coming out in a couple", "12:21", "weeks I think as part of the real rock", "12:23", "tira it's like a big climbing film", "12:24", "festival thing or film tour and that", "12:26", "sort of shows around the world but so", "12:29", "it's like a 40-minute short of 30", "12:32", "minutes for I'm actually I haven't seen", "12:33", "any of it those shoes that you wear on a", "12:35", "normal climb are very flexible or those", "12:38", "lost port Eva's yeah that's what I said", "12:41", "I want you they're very they almost look", "12:43", "like a sock with like a rubber bottom to", "12:45", "it we could really kind of grip yeah it", "12:47", "depends so some are super soft like that", "12:49", "it depends on what you're trying to", "12:51", "climb that some are really rigid that", "12:52", "you can step on a really small holds and", "12:54", "it supports your foot so like what I was", "12:56", "wearing free soloing on cap is like", "12:57", "quite rigid actually it's like I'm bored", "12:59", "like a platform so that you can put just", "13:01", "the tip of your toe on something really", "13:02", "small on your foot was to stay stay flat", "13:05", "more like a mountaineering type of yeah", "13:07", "kind of but still also very precise", "13:09", "because the mountaineering boot you", "13:10", "think clunky and big right a climbing", "13:12", "shoe is like a ballet slipper like", "13:13", "precise and tight but then also rigid", "13:16", "sometimes", "13:18", "and then also I don't know you know when", "13:20", "you're climbing cracks you put your foot", "13:21", "into the crack in any torque it sideways", "13:22", "to like lock it into place and so the", "13:24", "stiffer the the shoe is the more can you", "13:27", "know the more that you can lock the shoe", "13:29", "into place as opposed your foot you", "13:31", "basically have to use fewer muscles that", "13:32", "way are you starting a trend are there", "13:35", "are other people that are following your", "13:36", "footsteps now actually what do you think", "13:39", "I think probably yeah", "13:41", "you think yeah you honestly think that", "13:42", "yeah I think there's probably some", "13:44", "people that look at what you're doing", "13:46", "and young kids that think it must be you", "13:49", "know I here's what I think most people", "13:51", "look at the path that the average person", "13:54", "takes in life you know onna sell cars", "13:56", "I'm gonna be an insurance guy and they", "13:59", "look they look at it like it's deaf if", "14:01", "they look at a kid a young kid who's", "14:03", "like enjoying playing with his friends", "14:06", "or doing sports or playing video games", "14:08", "or reading comic books and then you look", "14:11", "at what could be the average path that", "14:15", "the average person takes in life and", "14:17", "sitting in an office all day under", "14:18", "fluorescent lights it looks like death", "14:21", "it looks like a slow aching death but", "14:25", "then I look at someone like you I'm like", "14:26", "wow this guy is living of special life", "14:28", "this is a special life we're so ideally", "14:30", "though somebody would look at it and see", "14:32", "that like this is somebody living a very", "14:35", "intentional life or having chosen a", "14:36", "certain path yes not necessarily free", "14:38", "solely I mean I would love to inspire", "14:39", "people to live an intentional life that", "14:42", "they care about yes I don't necessarily", "14:43", "feel like people all need to go free so", "14:46", "like right well I think that's that's a", "14:48", "very good way of describing it and very", "14:50", "good way of putting it because I think", "14:51", "you must certainly have influenced", "14:53", "people in that regard but I think also", "14:55", "people must be influenced in in the", "14:58", "sense that they see what you're doing is", "15:00", "man there's moments that you must", "15:04", "experience while you are climbing these", "15:06", "incredible faces that are kind of", "15:10", "magical when you're up there you're a", "15:12", "thousand feet up there the view is", "15:14", "fucking spectacular and you're doing it", "15:18", "and you get to the top of these things", "15:20", "though the rush and the feeling of", "15:22", "accomplishment and the euphoria and just", "15:25", "the glory of nature from the effective", "15:28", "yet I look at this", "15:31", "you could fucking wash your clothes on", "15:33", "the sweat that's in my hands right now", "15:35", "man that's not fucking pictures insane", "15:40", "we're looking

"know to me that's damn impressive just", "29:21", "look up a world record I mean I think", "29:23", "the male records like 5.7 seconds", "29:25", "there's six seconds it's like something", "29:26", "really really fast now do they know this", "29:29", "path in advance", "29:30", "yeah so that's exactly the same route", "29:32", "for everybody always same distance same", "29:34", "holds and so you basically memorize the", "29:37", "sequence and then you just perform it as", "29:38", "fast as you can so here we go here's a", "29:40", "world record how's this feel", "29:44", "so you stand on that thing yes if the", "29:47", "timer starts when your one foot comes", "29:48", "off the timer on the ground and then it", "29:50", "ends when you slap the thing on the top", "29:55", "yeah look at that five point whatever", "29:57", "seconds oh my god that doesn't look real", "30:00", "like doesn't it look like he's just", "30:02", "running you're like on the sidewalk", "30:03", "it's okay camera flat and they're", "30:07", "they're faking it yeah for the camera", "30:09", "yeah no it's totally now do these guys", "30:11", "free solo or they specifically", "30:13", "concentrate on there no no I mean", "30:15", "imagine if you were free so like like", "30:17", "this you would die for sure that", "30:21", "beta-blockers would be something that", "30:23", "someone who free solos would want to", "30:25", "look into I don't know yeah I don't know", "30:26", "that it's beta-blockers or something", "30:28", "that blocks your your brains production", "30:30", "of adrenaline oh but I mean I don't know", "30:33", "if you'd want that though because the", "30:34", "things if you have an adrenaline spike", "30:35", "it's because something weird went on and", "30:37", "you probably want to when I got had a", "30:39", "I've had a couple times where I like", "30:40", "broke a hold off or something like all", "30:42", "of a sudden your whole rips off and then", "30:43", "you have that like superhuman surge of", "30:45", "all have you grabbed back on yeah you", "30:47", "don't want to be mellow at that time", "30:49", "yeah exactly you don't be like I'm so", "30:50", "relaxed as I fall all the way to the", "30:52", "valley floor you know it's like you want", "30:54", "to freaking hold on one of the things in", "30:56", "the film was one of the guys who fell", "30:58", "and I guess eventually died", "31:00", "he was doing any fell and base-jumped", "31:02", "yeah with a parachute yeah he called it", "31:04", "freebasing he sort of pioneered that", "31:07", "sport as it were but there seems like a", "31:10", "good thing to have on your back well not", "31:12", "really so yeah I mean the idea makes", "31:14", "sense that if you're gonna fall off a", "31:16", "cliff have the parachute the thing is", "31:17", "that you need to be on a very specific", "31:19", "kind of cliff like what he was on where", "31:21", "was overhanging so that when he fell he", "31:22", "cleared the wall and he like floated out", "31:24", "into space but the thing is in Yosemite", "31:26", "all the walls are slightly less than", "31:27", "vertical in general and so it means that", "31:29", "you just tumbled on the wall you know", "31:31", "and the other thing is that even if you", "31:33", "have a parachute parachutes function as", "31:36", "a wing you know they have a direction to", "31:38", "them like air comes into them and you", "31:39", "fly in a direction which means that you", "31:41", "have to be facing away from the wall", "31:42", "when you open your parachute or else you", "31:44", "just fly right into the wall and crash", "31:45", "yeah so it basically means that if you", "31:48", "fall off unexpectedly you then have to", "31:50", "track away from the wall right yourself", "31:51", "in midair you know correct for", "31:53", "everything and then make sure you're", "31:54", "facing the right way it was like", "31:56", "basically there's a lot of things that", "31:57", "have to go right for the parachute to", "31:58", "help you but yeah I mean it's really", "32:03", "lucky why's that they're like oh why", "32:05", "don't you wear a parachute and you're", "32:06", "like well it's basically this 10-pound", "32:07", "training wait that doesn't really help", "32:08", "you much that guy just jumped on purpose", "32:11", "yeah this is oh well yeah it's good so", "32:15", "this is on the Eiger though it looks", "32:16", "like I think and you can yes he's like", "32:20", "jumping away he's getting a nice control", "32:22", "to opening he's like flying away from", "32:24", "the cliff it's like everything is going", "32:26", "right for him but imagine if one of his", "32:27", "footholds just broke and he started", "32:29", "pinwheeling down the wallet so you never", "32:30", "get the separation from the wall it was", "32:32", "astir let's just watch extreme sports", "32:36", "videos not just commentate on them all", "32:38", "right well this guy is surely gonna have", "32:41", "a disaster well one of the things from", "32:43", "the video when they were talking about", "32:45", "all the people that have died that every", "32:48", "essentially everyone from the past that", "32:51", "was a free soul or is dead and you're", "32:53", "saying there's other things that they", "32:55", "were doing like base jump yeah like BASE", "32:57", "jumping and and even there are a couple", "32:59", "older soloists I mean in the film", "33:01", "Peter Croft is like a legendary soloist", "33:03", "and he's a childhood hero of mine and", "33:05", "he's you know I don't wanna say pushing", "33:07", "60 cuz I'm not sure how old Peter is but", "33:09", "he's you know he's an older he's a", "33:10", "distinguished gentleman and he's living", "33:12", "in Eastern", "33:13", "he's climbing all the time he's like", "33:14", "loving life with his wife and actually", "33:16", "he's in Greece on a sport climbing", "33:17", "vacation right now just climbing for two", "33:19", "months just fun climbing with a rope", "33:22", "having a great time and so you know I", "33:24", "look at something like Peter and he was", "33:25", "free soloing it at the very cutting edge", "33:27", "for 20 years basically and and it's", "33:30", "still just a happy climber now but does", "33:32", "he free solo anymore it just climbs what", "33:34", "so it's funny I so I had dinner with him", "33:36", "a couple years ago I was like aw Peter", "33:37", "at what point did you quit soloing it's", "33:39", "sort of an elite level you know like", "33:40", "when did you sort of back off the grades", "33:42", "and he was like well actually I didn't", "33:43", "want to technically by the numbers I did", "33:45", "one of my hardest free solos a couple", "33:46", "years ago but it was like a sport route", "33:49", "at his local crag so like a route that", "33:50", "he'd would routinely climb for fitness", "33:52", "they just happened to be a pretty hard", "33:53", "number you know like climbing grades are", "33:55", "all sort of categorized and so he was", "33:58", "like yeah technically one of my heartis", "33:59", "Olos was just recently but it's like a", "34:01", "hard number but not nearly as much of an", "34:03", "undertaking as some of the big solos", "34:05", "that he'd done in the past like some of", "34:06", "the walls that he had sold at any some", "34:07", "of you back in the day you know and so", "34:09", "he was like well it's all just kind of", "34:11", "how you define difficulty you know now", "34:14", "when when you say that there's a number", "34:15", "system that sort of rates", "34:17", "what like how difficult my free solo", "34:20", "path is well know that rates climbing in", "34:23", "general with a rope or without a rope is", "34:24", "just it just rates how hard to climb is", "34:26", "what does El Cap well so the route that", "34:28", "I climbed is is 512 D for whatever that", "34:31", "means", "34:31", "or maybe it's 13 air depending how you", "34:33", "depending on what you want to call it", "34:36", "but um what does that mean yeah exactly", "34:38", "so the the climbing climbing grades are", "34:41", "defined I don't know so it's in in", "34:44", "America it's by the 70 decimal system", "34:46", "and it's a classification of terrain", "34:49", "from 1 to 1 to 6 where how many decibels", "34:52", "decimal system you know why do yes but", "34:54", "it's it's other parts of the world have", "34:57", "different systems and like in Australia", "34:59", "is just an open-ended numbers from 1 to", "35:02", "38 or something whereas I gate they get", "35:04", "pretty harder yeah climbing great", "35:07", "comparison defriend that's interesting", "35:10", "to what I'll do with because climbing", "35:13", "culture grew up in all different parts", "35:15", "of the world right and climbing culture", "35:17", "I guess is a big part of Yosemite yeah", "35:21", "well yeah I mean climbing as a sport in", "35:25", "the u.s. is sort of", "35:26", "birth from you somebody I mean the the", "35:28", "history of albinism or climbing rock", "35:31", "climbing anyway certainly comes from me", "35:32", "somebody in the US is it just because", "35:34", "the paths are so cool they just drew", "35:36", "people to it or yeah", "35:39", "partially I mean yeah the summit's are", "35:40", "so striking and I think a lot of it also", "35:43", "just had to do with just culture cuz a", "35:46", "big part of it was people from LA and", "35:48", "the Bay Area who probably had some sense", "35:51", "of classical alpinism from the Alps you", "35:52", "know people who had traveled to some", "35:53", "extent and then wanted to you know climb", "35:56", "other mountains and then they happen to", "35:57", "live near one of the most iconic areas", "35:59", "in the world and so then I don't know", "36:00", "but anyway so it winds up being called", "36:02", "the Simon Decimal System but but yes it", "36:05", "basically it's the the its categories of", "36:08", "terrain so one being walking on a normal", "36:10", "trail to being like scrambling a little", "36:11", "bit three being like scrambling with", "36:13", "your hands and feet up you know rocks", "36:15", "and then fourth class being like sort of", "36:18", "like climbing be easier and then fifth", "36:20", "class being an actual rock climbing and", "36:21", "so then it was five point one through", "36:24", "nine depending on how how hard things", "36:26", "are you know so five point one being", "36:28", "pretty easy five point nine being pretty", "36:29", "hard like you're rock climbing now and", "36:31", "its technical and then a certain point", "36:33", "that system wasn't adequate so they had", "36:36", "to start adding you know 5.10 and then", "36:38", "they subdivided into a b c d and then", "36:40", "5.11 a b c d and the 5.12 and so now", "36:43", "it's an open-ended system that right now", "36:45", "goes up to 516 visiting whoa but an L", "36:48", "cap is really complicated you have a so", "36:50", "L cap is 12 D or you know 5.12 D or", "36:55", "maybe five point 13 a which is the next", "36:57", "grade up it's all sort of but so", "37:00", "basically that means that it's it's", "37:01", "elite like that's very difficult and", "37:04", "something that like obviously an average", "37:06", "person can't do but it's definitely not", "37:07", "close to the physical limit of what's", "37:09", "been done in the world but that's with a", "37:12", "rope on and that's after you know years", "37:13", "of practice and what's the physical", "37:15", "limit like what is the peak of well", "37:17", "right now the hardest grade in the world", "37:18", "is 15 D which is extremely hard I mean", "37:21", "it's totally crazy but so one guy this", "37:23", "Czech guy has done one route that he", "37:25", "called fifteen D and so it hasn't been", "37:27", "repeated so it's not like an established", "37:28", "consensus but there's several fifteen", "37:30", "seas in the world and they're there many", "37:32", "fifteen B's in the world where's this", "37:34", "fifteen D", "37:35", "it's a cave in Norway I mean it's uh", "37:40", "yeah that's the kind of interesting", "37:42", "thing about climbing grades and climbing", "37:44", "difficulties that they're all spread", "37:45", "around the world the very specific", "37:47", "cliffs because it requires just the", "37:48", "right combination of angle and holds you", "37:51", "know there have to be enough things to", "37:52", "hold on to but not too many or else it's", "37:54", "easier right and so I for you know alley", "37:57", "climber and they're basically searching", "37:59", "the world all the time trying to find", "38:00", "that right mixture of rock Wow what a", "38:03", "strange exists yes it's really it's", "38:04", "really really neat yet very unusual now", "38:08", "when you hear about it but it's also", "38:09", "kind of elemental in a way you know", "38:10", "because rocks are just out there and", "38:12", "you're basically just going and", "38:13", "exploring nature until you find the", "38:15", "right kind of challenge well yeah", "38:17", "there's got it there's some sort of a", "38:18", "primal satisfaction that comes from", "38:20", "climbing something right yeah so I'm", "38:21", "where there's a certain yeah there's an", "38:23", "elemental quality for sure where you're", "38:25", "like this is something that just exists", "38:26", "in the world and you just yes yeah this", "38:28", "is yeah this is this is that a monitor", "38:30", "this check it climbing 15 no it's", "38:34", "already out it's it's a short online", "38:36", "actually on silence yeah the route he", "38:38", "put up he called silence but if this is", "38:40", "the film just scrub all the way to the", "38:42", "very oh that's the greater-than yeah", "38:44", "yeah so you can see he's climbing feet", "38:46", "first through some of it it's totally", "38:47", "extreme", "38:48", "so this guy Adam Andra is is for sure", "38:50", "the strongest climber in the world right", "38:52", "now like physical yeah physically so", "38:54", "he's he put up the world's first 15 C", "38:56", "and the first 15 D so he's basically", "38:58", "pushed the edge of difficulty for the", "39:00", "last several grades Wow", "39:02", "and he's just freakishly strong is that", "39:05", "something that you would have to be to", "39:08", "do what he's doing like a regular", "39:11", "climber couldn't do what he's doing is", "39:12", "almost like acrobatic involved yeah yeah", "39:14", "look what he's doing right there it's", "39:16", "like that so this is the world's first", "39:19", "15 C so slightly easier he did this", "39:21", "several years ago but it's like and then", "39:25", "yeah but that's where he has a rope you", "39:27", "know and he tries that over and over you", "39:28", "know but yeah he's he's an amazing", "39:31", "climber he's really he's like a polymath", "39:33", "he's like he's great at every discipline", "39:36", "what else does he do was so he have you", "39:39", "heard at the dawn wall on on cap no so", "39:43", "Tommy Caldwell you know who he is", "39:44", "another professional climber he's he's", "39:47", "he was I don't know", "39:49", "yeah he's basically one of America's", "39:51", "best climbers he did this route called", "39:52", "the dawn wall which is also a film in", "39:55", "theaters or was in theaters last month", "39:57", "is sort of random that too big climbing", "39:59", "films came out exactly the same time but", "40:00", "it's just one of those freak things but", "40:02", "so the dawn wall was considered the", "40:04", "hardest climb in the world to some", "40:07", "extent it's this thing it was a", "40:08", "seven-year project for him up up the", "40:10", "right side of El Cap the thing I climb", "40:11", "is on the left side I'll Cathy he comes", "40:12", "something on the right side which is", "40:13", "much harder but he was using a rope and", "40:15", "put seven years of work into it and", "40:17", "anyway yeah and then this guy Adam", "40:20", "hunter who were watching a video of he", "40:21", "he did the second ascent and he put like", "40:24", "a month to work into it and repeated it", "40:26", "and there's like wall he's really really", "40:28", "strong Wow so when you see a guy do", "40:31", "something like that does that make you", "40:33", "think about doing it or do you go that's", "40:37", "only something that someone can do with", "40:38", "rut with ropes oh yeah no I mean they're", "40:40", "whole categories of climbing that can", "40:43", "only be done with a rope because the", "40:44", "moves are way too insecure you fall off", "40:46", "way too often I mean anything that guy", "40:48", "fall off doing that like hundreds or", "40:50", "maybe even thousands of times", "40:52", "oh I mean for so for him to for him to", "40:55", "do something at the whole I mean to", "40:59", "climb at the very highest levels of", "41:01", "human person I mean so think about a", "41:03", "gymnast or something's at him right", "41:04", "there yeah that's oh he's free soloing", "41:06", "no no no he has a harness on okay yeah", "41:10", "no I mean look at what he's holding", "41:11", "Jeremy is one finger no well I think his", "41:14", "other one might be onto but but it's", "41:16", "basically like a tiny tiny tiny edge", "41:18", "this is the crux or one of the pitches", "41:20", "on the Don wall that is so insane that", "41:22", "guy could probably crush your head by", "41:25", "just grabbing it", "41:26", "when certainly the he has a certain", "41:28", "ferocity he has an intensity where you", "41:29", "can try with like 115 percent it's like", "41:31", "so I'm pretty sure if you grabbed your", "41:33", "head I've tried his hardest it would", "41:35", "just pop like I'm a little melon the", "41:38", "grip strength he's holding on such tiny", "41:40", "tiny little things yeah he's he's very", "41:43", "very strong Wow", "41:45", "so a guy like that when when you see him", "41:49", "do these paths these paths are paths you", "41:51", "can only do with a rope yeah yeah", "41:54", "does he free solo as well I don't think", "41:57", "he ever has but it's not really his", "42:00", "thing and the thing in some ways it's", "42:02", "really hard to do", "42:03", "both at a high level and I think or at", "42:06", "least to some extent it's hard to do", "42:08", "both at a high level because so for him", "42:09", "for him to climb something that hard", "42:12", "he needs that intensity he needs a 115", "42:14", "percent effort but if you're trying to", "42:16", "free solo well you definitely should", "42:18", "never be giving anything even remotely", "42:19", "close to 115 percent effort or else he", "42:21", "will die for sure", "42:22", "because you're so close to that razor", "42:24", "edge of failure when you're trying that", "42:26", "hard but with free soloing you have to", "42:28", "always keep it sort of within your", "42:29", "comfort zone because you don't die doing", "42:31", "it so I mean I think that I've always", "42:34", "sort of kept my my personal like you on", "42:37", "your personal barometer of effort I sort", "42:39", "of lived between 4 & 7 let's say or like", "42:41", "you know three and a half and seven", "42:43", "maybe where it's like you're never too", "42:45", "relaxed but you're also never going to", "42:46", "the absolute death we're sort of like in", "42:48", "the four to six it's a sweet spot where", "42:49", "you like I'm climbing I'm having a good", "42:51", "time but I'm not like trying too hard", "42:52", "and I'm not relaxed but so somebody like", "42:54", "got a monitor Tommy Caldwell like I've", "42:57", "climbed with Tommy a lot over the years", "42:58", "he's a great climber and I've really", "43:00", "seen this because he like I've seen him", "43:03", "just randomly fall off many times", "43:05", "because he was just like slip he's like", "43:06", "oh I'm so relaxed it's so easy and then", "43:08", "I'm like help I slipped and that's kind", "43:10", "of like an effort of one where you're", "43:11", "like your body is so relaxed that if", "43:13", "anything happens then you fall and with", "43:15", "it with a rope on that's fun in some", "43:16", "ways that's the more efficient way to", "43:17", "climb because you know you're so relaxed", "43:20", "most the time that you're saving a lot", "43:21", "of energy over all that every once in a", "43:23", "while when you fall it's like who cares", "43:24", "the Rope catches you it's no problem but", "43:26", "you have to trust those little things", "43:27", "you stick in the crowd yeah but that's", "43:29", "all so that's like I mean that's yeah", "43:31", "that's that's coming what is he doing", "43:33", "there he's uh he's counter pressure in", "43:35", "his leg into this crack to rest he's", "43:37", "basically like pushing his knee into the", "43:39", "rock - in order to relax his arms for", "43:41", "him but he's his whole body is leaning", "43:43", "backwards yes oh he's hanging upside", "43:44", "down basically every muscle in his body", "43:46", "is relaxed except for his calf and his", "43:48", "calf is forcing his knee into the rock", "43:49", "which holds him in place so he's just", "43:51", "had about one here that is so insane", "43:54", "that photos so insane yeah that's a", "43:57", "really efficient way to rest wood to", "43:58", "rest to rest your arms well because it's", "44:00", "really hard to hold well you know I mean", "44:04", "for him it's like for him to be able to", "44:06", "rest like that for one minute is an", "44:07", "amazing way to rest your arms for a", "44:09", "minute yeah but then it sort of stops", "44:10", "your core and it makes his calf", "44:11", "tired obviously now there's a guy like", "44:14", "that does he lift weights or anything to", "44:16", "prepare for these things personage s I", "44:18", "don't know what he's doing he's he's on", "44:19", "his own program yeah but it's it's", "44:21", "really climbing specific he's mostly", "44:22", "doing things with his fingers thing yeah", "44:25", "he's pretty jacked is that even him", "44:26", "that's crazy that's a weird yeah it's", "44:28", "the same it's the same route that's", "44:30", "interesting I've never seen that photo", "44:32", "but I mean I guess you just get jacked", "44:34", "from doing that too though just", "44:36", "constantly pulling yourself yeah yeah", "44:37", "for sure there's a climbing wall just", "44:40", "like local kids place and I told my", "44:43", "daughter give her a hundred bucks if she", "44:45", "can make it all the way to the other", "44:46", "side I think it's pretty difficult and", "44:49", "so she's become obsessed was trying to", "44:51", "get over there to get a hundred bucks", "44:52", "that's that's definitely Jack I mean", "44:54", "look at that he's Jack your daughter's", "44:56", "gonna wind up super ribbed it's hard to", "44:58", "do me like really fit I tried to do it", "44:59", "and I couldn't do it I was like wow this", "45:01", "is really hard", "45:02", "difficult to do I bet I bet if you if", "45:05", "you tried a bit I mean just because you", "45:06", "have such a background of movement and", "45:07", "fitness and everything I bet it wouldn't", "45:09", "be that hard for you no instruction yeah", "45:12", "I'm pretty heavy though for someone", "45:14", "who's short though that would be an", "45:16", "issue is hanging I'm - yeah but so in", "45:18", "theory climbing should be more in your", "45:20", "legs anyway you should be driving with", "45:21", "your legs because no matter what your", "45:24", "legs are always bigger and stronger", "45:25", "muscles in your arms so like that's", "45:27", "always what drives you upward yeah and", "45:28", "then your arms should only be holding", "45:30", "your weight in and keeping your keeping", "45:32", "you balanced over your feet basically", "45:33", "that's interesting that's something that", "45:35", "they've figured out fairly recently with", "45:37", "grappling over the last like 10 15 years", "45:40", "with like jujitsu and things along those", "45:41", "lines that your legs you it's really", "45:44", "important to use mostly your legs when", "45:46", "you're yapping totally I can see that I", "45:48", "mean that's what's driving you forward", "45:49", "and pushing the whole you know rolling", "45:51", "your opponent and manipulating your", "45:53", "opponent doing stuff with your legs do", "45:55", "you do anything to cross-train", "45:59", "no I mean I do other mountain sports a", "46:02", "little mountain biking or skiing or", "46:03", "things like that we do it for fun", "46:05", "yeah for fun and then the only real", "46:08", "cross-training to do is just sort of", "46:09", "like a push up in core type routine you", "46:12", "know like opposition training just to", "46:14", "maintain healthy you know healthy body", "46:16", "oh because you're constantly pulling", "46:18", "yeah exactly I'm always pulling for my", "46:20", "sport so then I try to do a little bit", "46:21", "of pushing in core just

stand on them and hammer", "61:39", "another Pete on and step on that which", "61:41", "is no yeah yeah there's just nothing to", "61:43", "hold on to it's too hard so then so then", "61:45", "there yeah something like 10 or 15 free", "61:47", "climbing routes where you can climb it", "61:49", "and so with my big goal of trying to", "61:51", "free solo El Cap to climb it without a", "61:53", "rope I was limited to just those 10 or", "61:55", "15 routes that are possible to climb", "61:56", "just with your hands and", "61:58", "and how did you establish the one that", "62:00", "you wanted to proceed on yeah so", "62:01", "basically I just wanted to doing the", "62:04", "easiest one because um basically it's", "62:06", "really hard to free climb El Cap by any", "62:08", "means and so the easiest one wound up", "62:10", "being the most secure the the best one", "62:12", "for me", "62:12", "how many I'd look done it well free solo", "62:15", "or free climb free solo free stolen I", "62:17", "mean nobody only yeah the only one yeah", "62:19", "I mean that's why there's the film and", "62:20", "everything it's it's a and nobody's ever", "62:22", "even thought about it you know nobody's", "62:24", "consider it's not like something that", "62:26", "people are trying to do now that you've", "62:28", "done it other other people that are", "62:30", "considering it I really do I mean I", "62:31", "think it's almost more the opposite now", "62:33", "that I've done it people are like oh", "62:34", "yeah I don't need to do that ever I mean", "62:36", "there's nobody even playing this game", "62:38", "right now really there aren't that many", "62:39", "high end free solos don't know how many", "62:41", "other two one or something really no no", "62:46", "no I don't know if they're any others", "62:48", "really right now this is a guy Brad go", "62:50", "bright and I'm an American guy who's", "62:51", "been free soloing at a pretty high level", "62:53", "but definitely he's a really good friend", "62:54", "of mine so I'm not like slandering him", "62:56", "but um but definitely at a very", "62:58", "different level than then like he would", "63:00", "never even dream of solving all cab so", "63:03", "he's sort of starting out well it's", "63:05", "nothing he's turning out I mean he's a", "63:06", "very good climber he's been climbing a", "63:07", "long time and he's done all kinds of", "63:09", "very difficult things but in terms of", "63:11", "free soloing I think he just doesn't", "63:13", "need to push it as that hard so he's", "63:16", "almost like he dabbles in free soloing", "63:18", "yeah well I mean I dabble in free so", "63:20", "long as well I mean mostly I'm climbing", "63:22", "with my friends doing other things you", "63:25", "know I mean I think most almost all", "63:27", "climbers only dabble in free so I mean", "63:28", "free soloing is sort of like one", "63:29", "discipline of climbing like we were", "63:31", "talking earlier about the Olympics", "63:32", "having multiple disciplines you know", "63:35", "there are many types of climbing and", "63:37", "most climbers do all of them to some", "63:38", "extent and free soloing always", "63:40", "represents sort of this small specialty", "63:42", "like extra style so you do free climbing", "63:45", "and then you also do the kind of", "63:47", "climbing where you have to put in those", "63:48", "posts and stand on them yeah yeah our", "63:50", "aid climbing artificial climbing so i", "63:51", "free-climb my aid climbs sometimes I", "63:53", "don't like to because it's too much work", "63:55", "it's too much like construction you know", "63:56", "you're like nailing things and standing", "63:57", "on it's like engineering yeah but I do", "63:59", "that because sometimes that's what it", "64:01", "requires to get up big mountains and we", "64:03", "don't do that and you nail things and", "64:05", "stand on them do you take them all yes", "64:07", "yeah the second person takes them out so", "64:08", "the one person uses them to get up and", "64:10", "then once the Rope is secured above them", "64:12", "second-person joins them and removes", "64:13", "them all and then you have all your gear", "64:15", "back and then you're able to do it again", "64:16", "for the next section how much weight is", "64:18", "that stuff well it depends so it can be", "64:20", "a lot and certainly back in the day when", "64:21", "people were doing the first descents of", "64:23", "El Cap I mean it's something like 40", "64:24", "pounds or 50 pounds of iron hanging off", "64:26", "them geez nowadays it's all a lot", "64:28", "lighter and you can use better gear but", "64:29", "um but yeah I mean it's a lot but that's", "64:31", "kind of the appeal of free climbing or", "64:33", "even free soloing is that you have", "64:34", "nothing on you now how secure is that", "64:37", "stuff that you're hanging it depends it", "64:40", "depends I mean there's certainly stories", "64:42", "that people falling and riffing all the", "64:43", "stuff back but but but sometimes that's", "64:47", "okay because if you're if you're", "64:48", "thousands of feet off the ground you can", "64:49", "take that hundred foot fall and not", "64:51", "touch anything and it's fine yeah but", "64:54", "still not really earlier this summer uh", "64:56", "counting on the thing we I mean so it's", "65:01", "all well-founded I mean you just gotta", "65:02", "trust it here", "65:03", "now earlier this summer I was talking", "65:05", "about Tommy called oh one of the best", "65:07", "climbers in the country so the two of us", "65:08", "did the speed record on El Cap earlier", "65:10", "this year and so that's the two of us", "65:12", "are tied together we're using a rope", "65:13", "we're using equipment but where anything", "65:15", "goes you're cheating as much as you can", "65:16", "it's just trying to get from the bottom", "65:17", "El Cap to the top as fast as possible", "65:20", "this is on a different route than the", "65:21", "one that I free solid in the film and so", "65:24", "we were trying to go sub 2hours and we", "65:26", "ultimately did it in 158 and it was", "65:27", "pretty awesome", "65:28", "we were really psyched but along the way", "65:30", "Tommy took a hundred foot fall at one", "65:31", "point he just I was talking about him", "65:33", "with the whole one to ten effort he was", "65:36", "climbing something that's really really", "65:37", "easy and he was probably giving an", "65:39", "effort of like two and he just slipped", "65:40", "you know and I was like oh but anyway he", "65:42", "freakin whipped you felt like a hundred", "65:45", "feet just straight down the wall didn't", "65:47", "touch anything because El Cap is like a", "65:48", "very clean vertical sheet of rock how", "65:50", "long does it take to fall hundred feet", "65:51", "that's not like syrup yes several second", "65:54", "second no no no no like four or five or", "65:56", "something but you accelerate very", "65:58", "quickly - yeah long enough to be like oh", "66:02", "my god I'm gonna die yeah no no no long", "66:06", "enough so the reason he fell so far is", "66:07", "because we were doing this sort of", "66:09", "complicated maneuvers normally I would", "66:11", "have a belay device on basically I would", "66:13", "be attached to the rope", "66:14", "earlier to like catch him but I'd taken", "66:16", "my belay device off and I was just tied", "66:17", "into the end so basically he fell on all", "66:19", "the slack whipped through until it hit", "66:21", "me at the end of the rope but so when he", "66:23", "yelled I basically had time to be like", "66:25", "oh my god he's falling like brace for", "66:27", "impact like knowing that in a second the", "66:29", "rope is gonna come tied against the end", "66:30", "that I'm tied into basically jerk me Wow", "66:33", "but then thankfully there's enough drag", "66:36", "in the system that it didn't turn me off", "66:37", "the stance that I was on or else I would", "66:38", "have gotten pulled like 50 feet across", "66:40", "the wall and it was all my stuff so when", "66:42", "he's falling and you're realizing that", "66:44", "you're gonna get yanked by his fall are", "66:47", "you like digging in to the right ya know", "66:48", "basically I was like oh my god you know", "66:50", "he's like brace yourself", "66:52", "like I was in this position I was", "66:53", "actually like facing out away from the", "66:55", "wall like facing out towards the meadow", "66:57", "because I I was in an open corner like", "67:01", "if you looked at the corner of the room", "67:02", "imagine one leg on each side facing", "67:05", "outward like pushed into this position", "67:06", "because it's like I was about to have to", "67:09", "untie my knot and retie and do some", "67:10", "things and so I was basically like all", "67:12", "ready to do some things and all of a", "67:14", "sudden I hear that he's falling I was", "67:15", "like oh my god and then thank God is", "67:17", "able had just sort of like the stick in", "67:18", "there geez but my point is just that", "67:20", "taking big fall I mean if you trust your", "67:22", "equipment and everything it it can be", "67:24", "okay to take big falls like that you", "67:26", "obviously try to avoid them because you", "67:28", "know had he hit a Ledge or something", "67:29", "then potentially he could have died but", "67:31", "because it was it was clean there it was", "67:33", "okay so if he was in a situation where", "67:36", "there was a slight angle and he fell", "67:37", "that far that's where it's really", "67:39", "dangerous yeah I mean worst case", "67:41", "scenario would be if he fell a hundred", "67:43", "feet and 75 feet down there was a Ledge", "67:45", "sticking out half the width of this", "67:47", "table because then you would just clip", "67:48", "it you'd break both your legs everything", "67:50", "would explode and you'd still fall yeah", "67:54", "what do you do if you fall and you break", "67:56", "something and you're half way up dude so", "67:58", "ok same route the the nose of a cab", "68:00", "which we were trying to do the speed", "68:01", "record on this friend of mine who I", "68:03", "actually previously held the speed", "68:05", "record with this older guy Hans Florine", "68:07", "who actually wrote the book how to speed", "68:09", "climb that I learned how to speed from", "68:10", "from many years ago so he freaking", "68:13", "exactly what I'm describing sort of", "68:15", "worst case scenario he took this 20", "68:17", "probably a 22 foot fall but he was", "68:20", "unlucky enough which is totally fine he", "68:21", "had a rope you had gear everything", "68:23", "worked exactly the way it's supposed to", "68:24", "he just fell always which is normal but", "68:27", "the bummer was that there was a little", "68:28", "ledge probably twice the size of that", "68:31", "box right there like that little wooden", "68:32", "box just kind of this little thing", "68:33", "sticking out from the wall about this", "68:35", "far basically he fell 20 feet hit that", "68:37", "broke both of his ankles and then", "68:39", "and then went off another two feet and", "68:41", "so the rope caught him and you know the", "68:43", "fall was exactly as expect all his gear", "68:45", "held everything's totally normal except", "68:47", "that he happened to hit that thing right", "68:48", "at the apex of you know at the full", "68:50", "force of his fall you know I had that", "68:52", "ledge bent two feet below him it", "68:53", "wouldn't matter at all he would just hit", "68:55", "it and jumped off into space but because", "68:57", "he'd already fallen 20 feet broke both", "68:59", "his ankles and then it was kind of", "69:02", "horrible I was actually up higher on the", "69:03", "wall that dad come in from above to just", "69:05", "rappel in and work on something and I", "69:07", "heard him yelling but I thought he was", "69:08", "just hooting and hollering like hey you", "69:09", "know how's it going type deal and then I", "69:11", "like it climbed out to the summit and", "69:13", "then when I hiked halfway back down I", "69:14", "got a voicemail from him saying that uh", "69:17", "you know being like oh hey it's Hans I", "69:19", "think I just broke my my tib fib", "69:22", "you know I'm basically like oh can you", "69:24", "can you help her but he'd already called", "69:25", "search-and-rescue and so a rescue was", "69:27", "already mobilized but search and rescue", "69:29", "in u7t it's really lead they're really", "69:32", "fast but it's still sort of by the books", "69:34", "you know it still takes kind of a lot of", "69:35", "time and so I was like oh man like maybe", "69:38", "I should run back up and rappel down and", "69:39", "like help my buddy rappel down the wall", "69:41", "again or something should I like get him", "69:43", "out of here faster just because when", "69:45", "search and rescues mobilize it's like a", "69:46", "long time and I was like if he's in a", "69:47", "lot of pain that sucks you know yeah", "69:49", "though as it", "69:51", "I really has died I wound up calling", "69:53", "search and rescue and talking to through", "69:54", "them to see if there was anything I", "69:55", "could do to help but ultimately I want", "69:57", "it just coming down because there wasn't", "69:59", "really anything for me to do so he's", "70:01", "essentially just suspending for a while", "70:02", "waiting for them to get him yeah so he", "70:04", "basically just sat on a Ledge with two", "70:06", "broken legs for you know six hours or 12", "70:09", "hours or something and then eventually", "70:10", "they managed to haul him up to the", "70:11", "summit and then I think that", "70:12", "helicoptered him off the next morning", "70:14", "oh because it was already dark by then", "70:16", "yeah I know it was kind of horrible but", "70:19", "he's sort of recovered by announcement", "70:20", "it's been five months or something so", "70:23", "he's back at it always climbing he's the", "70:25", "manager of a climbing gym he's you know", "70:27", "yeah well I mean it's two broken bones I", "70:29", "mean yes worse yeah it seems like no", "70:33", "super grim I was like but that's an", "70:35", "example of sort of worst-case you know", "70:37", "it's bad luck well that's actually not", "70:39", "worst case right know that yeah that's", "70:41", "not worst case that's just bad luck", "70:42", "young that's like when you're sitting", "70:45", "there if you're sitting there hanging", "70:47", "off a ledge like that with two broken", "70:49", "ankles for six hours I mean there must", "70:51", "be grim", "70:52", "but if you don't get to you the season", "70:54", "swelling and yeah so I think he and his", "70:56", "partner actually repelled down 100 feet", "70:58", "to a slightly bigger ledge so that he", "70:59", "could lay on it and elevate his legs and", "71:01", "then I think there were some other", "71:02", "climbers around that gave him a jacket", "71:04", "you know so he could sort of bundle up", "71:05", "and like lay there and sort of manage", "71:07", "but yeah I mean it seems extremely", "71:10", "character building the life you choose", "71:11", "you know yeah no it's really I'm like", "71:15", "that is he that actually kind of makes", "71:16", "me feel really bad you could just", "71:17", "because of that like that kind of thing", "71:18", "is really close to home you know it's", "71:20", "like because he's a friend and it's just", "71:21", "so like that's bad yeah now I can only", "71:24", "imagine you know when when you think", "71:28", "about your life and you think about the", "71:30", "stuff that you do do you deep is there a", "71:33", "point where you feel like you won't do", "71:36", "it anymore or a point where you feel", "71:38", "like you won't free solo anymore or do", "71:40", "you look at like your friend who you", "71:42", "were talking about who's older who's", "71:43", "still free soloing and doing difficult", "71:46", "pass do you think this is just your life", "71:47", "forever no I don't know I honestly I'm", "71:52", "not sure I don't think it's my path", "71:54", "forever necessarily just because there", "71:57", "just aren't always bigger and harder", "71:59", "things to do you know I mean El Cap", "72:02", "represented sort of the end of this very", "72:04", "long road for me I mean I sold many many", "72:06", "things that were all sort of leading", "72:07", "towards El Cap and then I finally did", "72:09", "that and in at least right now I can't", "72:12", "really imagine anything more inspiring", "72:14", "to me in terms of free soloing I mean", "72:17", "there plenty of other climbing", "72:17", "challenges that I'm interested in like I", "72:19", "was just saying doing the speed record", "72:20", "is something that I did you know this", "72:21", "summer but it's just like winning a big", "72:24", "hand in Vegas we're just like okay we", "72:26", "got all the money let's get the fuck out", "72:27", "of here no because that's that that it's", "72:30", "too much luck you know I mean it's like", "72:32", "it's more like realizing a life dream", "72:33", "and you're sort of like okay yeah I've", "72:36", "seen but I mean you know it's it's a", "72:38", "similar idea where you're like okay well", "72:40", "no it's not even I mean it's yeah yeah", "72:43", "it's about now yeah no no more big crazy", "72:47", "risks yeah but that's the thing is that", "72:50", "it's not even I was never seen as a big", "72:51", "crazy risk you know I wasn't what was or", "72:53", "wasn't rolling the dice I was sort of", "72:55", "training for this thing and then I did", "72:57", "it and I'm just not sure if there's a", "72:58", "bigger thing that's worth more effort", "73:00", "you know so I don't know I mean you know", "73:02", "as you see in the film like I've the", "73:04", "relationship with my girlfriend and", "73:05", "she's", "73:05", "we have this nice life together and", "73:07", "there's so much else and climbing and", "73:08", "you know I mean maybe I'll never never", "73:11", "seek out big free soloing challenges", "73:14", "again I mean we'll see", "73:15", "now you're still relatively young in", "73:18", "terms of life itself do you do you think", "73:21", "maybe there could be something that you", "73:23", "would enjoy as much as you enjoy", "73:24", "climbing well I mean so no matter what", "73:27", "I'll climb my whole life I mean I'm", "73:29", "forgetting I love climbing I'm even on", "73:30", "the foam tier I'm climbing in the gym", "73:31", "every day just for the movement of it", "73:34", "just to enjoy climbing but um I don't", "73:36", "know I'm I have a foundation that I've", "73:38", "worked with for the last five or six", "73:39", "years supporting solar around the world", "73:41", "and so I could see putting more and more", "73:44", "effort into that I mean that's something", "73:46", "dissatisfying in a way that climbing", "73:48", "sort of isn't because it actually has a", "73:50", "real tangible impact on the world you", "73:52", "know I mean climbing is really", "73:54", "fulfilling personally but when it's all", "73:56", "said and done it's like it's just me", "73:57", "going rock climbing it doesn't really", "73:59", "matter but but at least working with the", "74:01", "foundation it's like actually doing", "74:02", "something real what is your foundation", "74:04", "it's just the Honnold foundation but", "74:06", "it's a we've been supporting solar all", "74:08", "this I mean if you want the the longer", "74:11", "version it's basically you know I was", "74:13", "like looking for some way to do", "74:14", "something positive in the world and so I", "74:15", "was looking to support environmental", "74:17", "projects and then I was like there's no", "74:18", "real point in supporting environmental", "74:19", "projects that they don't also support in", "74:21", "like increased standard of living that", "74:23", "like help people in need and that sort", "74:25", "of led me to solar projects basically", "74:27", "solar energy access and so that's what", "74:30", "we in support in the last five six years", "74:31", "and so what do you do with this project", "74:34", "well so domestically it was that mostly", "74:36", "it's just been my way of donating my", "74:37", "money to two other projects that that", "74:41", "support solar so I'm domestically in the", "74:43", "u.s. I've been supporting this group", "74:44", "crude alternatives for example in so I", "74:48", "mean I've done a few ins installations", "74:50", "with them and in Sacramento in my", "74:51", "hometown where basically low-income", "74:54", "family just gets a free home solar", "74:55", "system on their house and so it saves", "74:58", "them the energy bills and then also in", "74:59", "terms of you know carbon emissions it's", "75:02", "just it's good for the planet you're", "75:04", "slowly greening the grid but um and then", "75:07", "the bigger potentially the bigger", "75:10", "impacts have been projects we've been", "75:12", "supporting in Africa to give access to", "75:15", "like solar Lantern solar lights being", "75:16", "able to charge cell phones disney-like", "75:18", "small-scale

it's like a lot less", "79:08", "energy but it's just the roof panel the", "79:10", "roof panel isn't it didn't we they", "79:13", "they're a weird company though that's", "79:15", "the company that many years ago there", "79:18", "was a big storm that hit the East Coast", "79:20", "and they had a bunch of cars parked at a", "79:22", "dock and they all exploded when the", "79:23", "water hit them and they realized wait", "79:25", "wait wait wait you can't get your things", "79:27", "drenched in water like when the water", "79:29", "hit a certain level like they had a", "79:32", "severe flaw

Karma's", "79:45", "even more hilariously watching us", "79:47", "exploding that's pretty bad that's like", "79:50", "that's all bad all the way around yeah I", "79:52", "think they've since fixed that but yeah", "79:54", "it was a big flaw that's I was just", "79:56", "actually reading I was reading this", "79:58", "business management book but um we're", "79:59", "talking about the Ford Pinto with having", "80:02", "freaking gas tanks to close the back", "80:04", "bumpers basically the gas tank protected", "80:06", "by an inch of plastic and you know yeah", "80:09", "speaking of explosion cards but that", "80:11", "actually I think killed lots of people", "80:12", "because you know they were actually put", "80:14", "into production and then there tons of", "80:15", "accidents and the cars explode and", "80:16", "you're just like man that's speaking of", "80:19", "bad decisions that in auto manufacturing", "80:22", "yeah the Pinto was a disaster", "80:24", "it wasn't good but yeah I think what", "80:28", "what they what they're capable of doing", "80:30", "right now I think you're right I don't", "80:31", "think you can power a car with solar", "80:34", "panels completely I mean you certainly", "80:36", "can from your house that was their", "80:38", "initial claim when they announced it", "80:39", "that it would power the whole car and", "80:41", "everyone was like that's bullshit that's", "80:43", "definitely bullshit two years ago they", "80:47", "said they could power the whole car with", "80:48", "the roof August of 2016", "80:50", "huh I'm trying to find the updates but", "80:53", "that seems that seems totally outrageous", "80:55", "cuz also I mean the future of cars is", "80:57", "born like a smaller car with no tree", "80:59", "like a glass roof like Tesla style where", "81:00", "it's sort of a national ad right here", "81:03", "so a roof create enough energy to power", "81:06", "the car no other vehicles sold in the US", "81:08", "had ever offered this capability well I", "81:10", "mean so that might be true if it just", "81:11", "sat parked in the Sun for 12 hours and", "81:13", "then you drove home right away yeah you", "81:17", "worked at night yes it turns all day and", "81:20", "your commutes really short but the", "81:22", "numbers totally don't work yeah well you", "81:24", "would know better than anybody if you're", "81:26", "involved in solar yeah I don't know but", "81:29", "I mean the solar panels of today I mean", "81:30", "I have a buddy of mine who does a lot of", "81:32", "backpacking and he carries around this", "81:34", "it's like a foldable solar charger for", "81:37", "his phone and he you know folds it up", "81:40", "and lays it out and then puts a charger", "81:44", "there and then he uses that charger to", "81:46", "charge his phone but he did you know", "81:47", "like he'll go 20 plus days with just", "81:50", "this thing yeah I mean so I mentioned", "81:52", "our expedition to Antarctica last winter", "81:54", "so that's 24 hours of sunlight because", "81:57", "you're you know", "81:57", "in their summer and our entire", "82:00", "expedition was run from solar and so", "82:02", "we'd actually taken a generator and the", "82:03", "other guys on the trip forgot oil for", "82:05", "the generator basically and so it wasn't", "82:07", "gonna work and so we're like oh I guess", "82:09", "we'll have to try to use the solar which", "82:11", "had sort of been our backup system and", "82:12", "it actually we ran the whole trip on", "82:14", "solar everything worked and so they were", "82:16", "filming so they're a bunch of cameras", "82:18", "bunch of batteries laptops backing up", "82:19", "drives and then they were flying a drone", "82:21", "quite a bit for aerial footage it was", "82:23", "all kind of beautiful so I mean they", "82:24", "basically ran this whole operation off", "82:26", "solar one of the one of the camera guys", "82:27", "that's got Pablo he's a good for a month", "82:29", "basically just had to wake up you know", "82:31", "every two hours to move the panel's", "82:32", "around the tent as the Sun tracks are on", "82:34", "the sky you know so that it's always in", "82:36", "full Sun right but um and you get to", "82:38", "sleep with the batteries and things to", "82:39", "make sure things stay warm enough but", "82:40", "otherwise I mean with us I mean because", "82:42", "I'm really cold yeah it's funny because", "82:44", "you put your laptops and stuff into", "82:45", "coolers like into ice chests to keep", "82:47", "them insulated enough to stay warm as", "82:49", "opposed to cold well no because the", "82:50", "outside temperature is so cold but it", "82:53", "was cool though because you know that", "82:54", "way we didn't have to run this like loud", "82:56", "stinky annoying generator and like you", "82:59", "just have your panels working full time", "83:01", "yeah that's one of the weirdest things", "83:02", "about like Tesla's when you drive it and", "83:04", "like there's no noise yeah no it's", "83:06", "awesome yeah yeah so much more peaceful", "83:08", "yeah I mean but that's the future it's", "83:10", "like if you imagine a city that's all", "83:11", "silent electric cars with no emissions I", "83:13", "mean imagine how much more pleasant the", "83:14", "pedestrian experience is yeah when it's", "83:17", "not like diesel exhaust right next you", "83:18", "on the city streets yeah you don't hear", "83:20", "the car that runs you over well you know", "83:22", "no you still do that because uh", "83:23", "something like 30 percent of the noise", "83:25", "is the tires yeah it's like you still", "83:26", "hear of cars yeah but then it's just so", "83:29", "much more mellow", "83:29", "you don't hear like an engine like", "83:31", "ripping right by you yeah I think it's", "83:33", "inevitable that we figure out a way that", "83:34", "you can just power everything from solar", "83:38", "and including cars as you're driving", "83:40", "them I mean the only make sense as the", "83:42", "technology improves yeah we'll see see I", "83:45", "mean uh there's development and solar", "83:49", "film sort of in Windows like so imagine", "83:51", "office building where the windows are", "83:52", "all producing power I mean if you think", "83:54", "about that with the car if it's just", "83:55", "like a glass dome over you but it's all", "83:57", "sort of producing power yeah nobody I", "83:58", "mean it's pretty amazing I have a watch", "84:00", "that was on solar power", "84:01", "that's not a lot of power yeah but still", "84:04", "I mean you don't really need any", "84:05", "batteries for it yeah I see oh yeah yeah", "84:08", "I did when I was a kid I don't like that", "84:10", "yeah", "84:10", "yeah that's pretty that's pretty", "84:12", "straightforward though that's a small", "84:13", "amount of power that's drawing when you", "84:16", "got involved in this how much", "84:18", "preparation did you do I mean what was", "84:21", "what was the the motivation like having", "84:23", "fur the foundation yeah I mean honestly", "84:26", "like I said I was just looking to do", "84:28", "something positive for the world and so", "84:30", "my exploring options you won so I was", "84:32", "gonna start donating significant", "84:33", "percentage of my income to to", "84:35", "environmental nonprofits and then I", "84:37", "decided that I should do it in sort of a", "84:39", "public facing way and in the form of the", "84:41", "foundation just because I felt like you", "84:43", "know I'm never gonna have nearly as much", "84:44", "money as as real philanthropic", "84:46", "organization you know like the Bill and", "84:48", "Melinda Gates Foundation like I'll never", "84:50", "have it I'll never have real dollars", "84:52", "like that but I do sort of have this", "84:53", "platform like some sort of public you", "84:55", "know persona whatever so I was like well", "84:58", "at least if I donate things I can sort", "84:59", "of leverage that and the right way to", "85:01", "contribute I don't know basically try", "85:03", "maximize the good that I'm doing and so", "85:06", "yes of them I just started researching", "85:07", "organizations that I felt like we're", "85:09", "doing great work and that led me to", "85:11", "solar basically does most your income", "85:13", "come from sponsors and from public", "85:15", "appearances it was mostly sponsors and", "85:18", "then it sort of has shifted into", "85:19", "sponsors and sort of one-off things so", "85:21", "like I published a book a few years ago", "85:24", "and so there's an advance from that and", "85:25", "like the film has made a little money", "85:28", "the you know random little things and", "85:31", "then now it's also sort of split with", "85:33", "like corporate speaking type commercial", "85:35", "opportunities as well so sponsorship is", "85:37", "still probably the biggest thing for me", "85:38", "so like the North Bay's being my biggest", "85:39", "pond sir and most important sponsor for", "85:42", "me but then now it's sort of split", "85:44", "between a bunch of different sources", "85:45", "this is so the public speaking things", "85:47", "these corporate appearances you just go", "85:50", "and get just talk to them about free", "85:52", "solo climbing and yeah talking about", "85:55", "climbing talk about preparation or I", "85:56", "mean depends on what somebody needs", "85:58", "really depends with organizations I've", "86:00", "spoken to a bunch of venture capital", "86:03", "type firms about risk-taking and risk", "86:04", "management or how that's interesting you", "86:06", "know so they just look at you as like", "86:08", "sort of inspiration yeah mix things up", "86:11", "for the company yeah I mean I'd like to", "86:13", "think that it's a slightly more", "86:15", "interesting talk than the average", "86:16", "business speaker you know and it's", "86:17", "certainly more beautiful images you know", "86:19", "like if I if I give a nice slideshow on", "86:20", "chat for a bed it's on you know I mean", "86:22", "it's beautiful it's different", "86:24", "and but I think that it still gets back", "86:26", "to some of the same elemental issues you", "86:27", "know talking about the yeah I mean how", "86:30", "do you manage risk in your life and and", "86:31", "what's worth it and how do you choose", "86:33", "it's it's a smart move to for a company", "86:36", "to just kind of like vary the kind of", "86:38", "input that gets to the the employees", "86:40", "like give them something that's kind of", "86:42", "spectacular and interesting and yeah now", "86:47", "when you look at the future do you do", "86:51", "you have a map of what you would like to", "86:53", "be doing do you are you just sort of", "86:55", "enjoying your experience here or do do", "86:58", "you have grand plans yeah I don't really", "87:01", "have grand plans I mean I've never", "87:03", "really had a grand plan it's always been", "87:04", "that I love climbing I want to do it", "87:06", "well I want to push myself and I think", "87:09", "that's kind of my grand plan I mean I'm", "87:10", "I'm still trying to be a better climber", "87:13", "I'm still trying to grow the foundation", "87:15", "do something more significant through it", "87:17", "I'm actually hired a full-time executive", "87:19", "director this year this woman who's", "87:20", "running a for me we're just kind of", "87:22", "awesome so we're actually sort of", "87:23", "ramping it all up a little bit that was", "87:24", "slightly in response to the film because", "87:25", "I sort of figured that you know this is", "87:28", "like a moment that I should try to take", "87:29", "advantage of and use it to do something", "87:30", "more positive and so that's that's all", "87:33", "sort of exciting for me and it's", "87:35", "definitely not a grand plan but it's you", "87:37", "know it's just sort of all incremental", "87:38", "incremental progress so when you're", "87:41", "doing all these climbs you have a lot of", "87:43", "time when you're it takes time to do", "87:46", "these things yeah so is this when you", "87:47", "start thinking about these ideas about", "87:50", "thinking about like how much you enjoy", "87:51", "being out here in nature and what yeah", "87:55", "for sure yeah for sure I mean I spend", "87:58", "most of my time in the most beautiful", "88:00", "places on earth I mean spending Westmont", "88:01", "time in national parks and public lands", "88:04", "in general and so I mean all these", "88:06", "beautiful places and it's like yeah I", "88:07", "mean I care about them I want to you", "88:09", "know if I have a family someday I want", "88:10", "to be able to take my kids to these same", "88:11", "places and have them appreciate the land", "88:13", "in the same way I mean yeah so like you", "88:16", "somebody the last five years freaking", "88:17", "the entire forest has basically died", "88:19", "from from pine needles while all the", "88:21", "pine trees have basically died because", "88:22", "of pine beetles and so like just in the", "88:24", "last five years let's say the Yosemite", "88:27", "Valley floor has sort of transformed", "88:29", "from like a dense pine forest to sort of", "88:30", "this open oak forest it's like totally", "88:32", "different character because all the pine", "88:34", "trees have died and then they've been", "88:35", "cutting them all down to reduce fuel", "88:36", "load so they're basically logging trucks", "88:38", "with pine trees leaving the park", "88:39", "non-stop which you know which I'm which", "88:42", "I totally support I'm not like anti", "88:44", "logging the dead trees because like you", "88:46", "may as well use them if they're already", "88:47", "dead and you I definitely don't want to", "88:48", "see you so many valley I'll burst into", "88:50", "flames so it makes sense but at the same", "88:52", "time I mean you know that's a real", "88:54", "that's a very direct result of climate", "88:56", "change I mean it's ten years of drought", "88:57", "in California combined with with the", "88:59", "shorter winners it's like you just have", "89:01", "these beetles decimating the entire", "89:02", "forest and I don't know I mean that's", "89:05", "the sucks you know like I don't I don't", "89:07", "want to see the whole for his die and", "89:08", "it's not an invasive beetle or yeah", "89:10", "beetle yeah well I think it's invasive", "89:12", "in that I don't know specifically with", "89:15", "you Simon I could be wrong about this", "89:16", "but with a lot of the pine beetle", "89:18", "problems in Colorado and that's more to", "89:20", "do with a shorter winter and and warmer", "89:22", "temperatures because normally the larvae", "89:25", "would die through the winter like they", "89:26", "would freeze mm-hmm", "89:28", "but you know basically they're not", "89:29", "freezing it's the same extent and so the", "89:31", "population explodes and then you wind up", "89:33", "with all the trees dying yeah we were", "89:34", "there and we were in Big Bear a few", "89:36", "years back when they were having a real", "89:37", "issue with it and they were having real", "89:40", "significant fire scares young it was it", "89:43", "was nerve-wracking you somebody was like", "89:46", "on fire for most of the summer is this", "89:47", "crazy for the whole southern part of the", "89:49", "part was like burning for months and", "89:50", "that's you know I mean fire is a natural", "89:53", "part of the ecosystem and the you know", "89:55", "to some extent you're like that's normal", "89:56", "but it's like it's not normal right now", "89:57", "because the fuel load is so high it's", "89:59", "like so dry it's just it's too much you", "90:01", "know and I just would love for my kids", "90:04", "someday to be able to appreciate the", "90:05", "park the way I have for so long and I", "90:07", "just don't want to see it don't burn", "90:08", "yeah when I was when we were in Big Bear", "90:10",
