a", "01:46", "lot of endorsements so nine figures nine", "01:49", "figures dude yeah make seven figures", "01:51", "yeah girls would be like wow he makes", "01:54", "seven figures so tell me nine nine a", "01:57", "blue two at all", "01:58", "yeah shit raizy man whoopsies that's", "02:02", "crazy", "02:02", "but it's so much they interviewed one", "02:08", "defensive like a guy on the", "02:10",

this", "03:52", "case and I was the only one who raised", "03:54", "his hand really yeah so you know I'm", "04:01", "willing to listen and the guy says okay", "04:05", "sir he says I think I know who you are", "04:07", "he says would you listen to everybody", "04:12", "else's idea behind while you're", "04:14", "deliberating on this trial I said if", "04:15", "certainly he said but you would try to", "04:18", "convince them they were wrong if you had", "04:21", "another idea right and I said yes that's", "04:23", "accurate and you dismissed me because", "04:28", "charismatic you can do

backstage there will", "05:06", "be no marijuana consumed there will be", "05:09", "no drinking etcetera cetera and one of", "05:12", "the sisters of was nuns at the time", "05:14", "claimed that she

sat in", "05:48", "front of the judge we sat on one side", "05:49", "down the other side two sisters two nuns", "05:53", "came in and a family a father a mother", "05:55", "and three of the daughters in school", "05:58", "uniforms you know they played it up hard", "05:59", "and the judge says why who filed here I", "06:03", "said sir I didn't see no it was $125 and", "06:07", "there was no smoke you know there was no", "06:10", "smoking of anything illegal backstage", "06:12", "whatever and um he had the one of the", "06:16", "nuns stand up she said I refuse to pay", "06:18", "him because I

like $125 later", "06:33", "they have the t-shirt yeah how would she", "06:36", "know I've heard you say that you believe", "06:42", "that consciousness is non-local right", "06:45", "what do you mean
