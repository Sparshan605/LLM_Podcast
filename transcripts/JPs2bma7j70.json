I", "44:27", "was like I couldn't stop thinking about", "44:28", "it and I needed to like just if she was", "44:31", "gonna tell me like there's no way I was", "44:32", "getting in then I could at least like", "44:34", "put that to bed so I just call her up", "44:36", "and said you know I read about this race", "44:37", "and I can't stop thinking about it and", "44:40", "I'd really like to do it but you know", "44:41", "maybe I'm crazy because you know I don't", "44:44", "know why I'm even calling you because I", "44:45", "haven't really done very much you know", "44:48", "and she said

an", "153:31", "endurance athlete you want to really", "153:33", "emphasize the fat-burning zone which is", "153:35", "like the lower intensity of the aerobic", "153:37", "the aerobic zone of energy

a certain level of", "153:47", "exertion in which you're metabolizing", "153:49", "fat for energy as opposed to glycogen", "153:51", "and if you're metabolizing fat for", "153:53", "energy you can

you know there's a difference", "154:28", "between dietary fat subcutaneous fat but", "154:31", "we all have no matter how lean you are", "154:32", "and how matter you know I've gotten very",

very", "154:43", "specific about the training zones and", "154:45", "the exertion levels that you're that you", "154:47", "are that you're that you're doing", "154:50", "whether it's running swimming

specific about what", "155:02", "your output is you have a heart rate", "155:04", "monitor you have the bikes these days", "155:06", "have a computer on them right so you", "155:08", "have your power meter which registers", "155:09", "the force you're exerting on the pedals", "155:11", "and watts and then you can extrapolate", "155:13", "that out after a ride what your average", "155:15", "Watts are for that ride and then you", "155:17", "balance that against what your heart", "155:19", "rate was at that particular Watts what", "155:22", "the grade you know how much elevation", "155:23",

"155:38", "goes back to really emphasizing that fat", "155:41", "burning zone that aerobic zone because", "155:43", "because the more efficient you can be at", "155:46", "that you can you can you can

started doing this", "156:00", "endurance stuff out and wanted to stay", "156:04", "in my zone - which is the aerobic zone I", "156:07", "would have to keep my heart rate when I", "156:08", "was running below about 145 initially", "156:12", "when I first started running I couldn't", "156:15", "if I ran faster than like a 9 or a 930", "156:19", "pace my hair I would go over 145 and", "156:21",

"156:29", "heartrate region over time my pace", "156:33", "increased without my heart rate going up", "156:35", "which which is telling which is telling", "156:38", "me that I'm becoming a more

you actually", "156:50", "improve your boundaries in a certain", "156:53", "respect yeah I mean it was explained to", "156:55", "me initially like if you want to go fast", "156:57", "first you're gonna have to go slow", "156:59", "yeah and build that build the foundation", "157:01", "of this machine from the ground up and", "157:03", "that doesn't mean there isn't a time and", "157:05", "place for speed work and you know super", "157:08", "exertion work at a higher intensity zone", "157:11", "but but the key to success in endurance", "157:15", "sports is really emphasizing that that",

it it requires a different", "159:53", "kind of discipline because you kind of", "159:55", "have to check your ego at the door you", "159:56", "know what I mean and and sometimes you", "159:58", "want
