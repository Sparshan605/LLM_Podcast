were", "10:49", "prohibited from knowing this and instead", "10:53", "they told only a few select people yeah", "10:56", "in the original case there were only", "10:57", "eight members of Congress called the", "10:59", "gang of eight who knew about this then", "11:02", "there were the people on the", "11:04", "intelligence committees both in the", "11:06", "Senate in the house who were told about", "11:08", "this but they were only told partially", "11:10", "about it they weren't told the full", "11:11", "scope of it and now that they had been", "11:13", "told about it because they had security", "11:15", "clearances and", "11:16", "like that they weren't allowed to tell", "11:17", "anybody else even if they objected to it", "11:19", "and we had one Senator Ron Wyden I mean",

"11:36", "are being carried out but nobody knew", "11:38", "what they were talking about and so", "11:40", "journalists were like you know they've", "11:42", "got concerns what is that Lassie what", "11:43", "are you trying to say timmy's them well", "11:44", "but they were getting it wrong they", "11:46", "couldn't tell what was happening so what", "11:48", "had happened was that we the American", "11:50", "people had sort of lost our seat at the", "11:53", "table of government we were no longer", "11:55", "partner to government we had simply", "11:57", "become subject to government

passing year", "12:22", "there's kind of a new class that's being", "12:25", "created a government class and then the", "12:27", "public civil class that are held to", "12:30", "different standards of behavior and when", "12:31", "we start talking about leaking and", "12:32", "whistleblowing this becomes even more", "12:34", "clear and so what I did was I wanted to", "12:38", "clarify that kind of lassie bark right I", "12:40", "just wanted everybody to know what was", "12:43", "going on I didn't want to say the", "12:46", "government can't do this I didn't want", "12:48", "to say this is how you guys have to live", "12:50", "because that's not for me to say now but", "12:52", "I do believe that everybody in the", "12:54", "United States and more broadly people in", "12:55", "the world who are having their rights", "12:56", "violated by a government should have at", "12:59", "least an understanding of how that is", "13:01", "happening what the authorities sort of", "13:04", "the

what you guys say this is okay", "13:14", "but I disagreed that this is not okay I", "13:17", "object and I want things to change and", "13:19", "so I gathered evidence of what I believe", "13:21", "to be a criminal or unconstitutional", "13:24", "activity on the part of government and I", "13:26", "gave this to journalists right", "13:29", "now I gave this to journalists under a", "13:32", "very strict condition here which was", "13:33", "that they publish no story in this", "13:36", "archive of information simply because it", "13:38", "was interesting right no clickbait not", "13:40",

"institutional judgment and stand behind", "13:49", "and this was three different newspapers", "13:52", "that it was in the public interest to", "13:55", "know and so then beyond that there was", "14:00", "additional is because if you could see", "14:02", "sort of what I was doing here what had", "14:03", "happened what had led us into this", "14:05", "pitfall was that the system of checks", "14:12", "and balances that's supposed to", "14:14", "self-regulate our government had failed", "14:15", "the courts had abdicated their role in", "14:19", "policing the executive in the Congress",

"14:29", "through and they didn't have access to", "14:31", "the information that the programs were", "14:33", "ineffective so they were just taking the", "14:34", "government's word for it they didn't", "14:36", "want to wait in Congress most of them", "14:39", "didn't even know right and the ones who", "14:42", "did know it was the same thing they were", "14:44", "getting their pockets stuffed with money", "14:46", "by the defense contractors that were", "14:48", "getting rich for building these systems", "14:50", "that were violating the rights of each", "14:51", "of us so they benefited by just saying", "14:54", "nothing and then the executive", "14:55", "themselves whether we're talking about", "14:57", "Bush right whether we're talking about", "14:59", "Obama or whether we're talking about", "15:00", "Trump now all these guys were okay with", "15:03", "a constantly growing surveillance state", "15:05", "because they're the ones whose hands", "15:07", "were on the lever at the time they got", "15:09", "to aim it they got to use it if you had", "15:11", "a little search box in front of you they", "15:14", "would give you the email history and you", "15:16",

record of that", "15:32", "they can get that from Google and so", "15:34", "this was this was the whole thing how do", "15:37", "we correct for that so when you have", "15:40", "somebody", "15:42", "who wants to inform the public of", "15:43", "something and we'll get into the proper", "15:45", "channels arguments later but you can't", "15:49", "go through the institution to get these", "15:51", "corrected because the institution knows", "15:53", "it's wrong and is doing it anyway right", "15:56", "that's the whole origin of the program", "15:58", "is they want to do something that", "16:00",

"16:07", "and I could have on the technologist", "16:09", "right I worked with the journalists and", "16:12", "then that to create an adversarial step", "16:15", "right someone who would argue

the", "50:47", "way these things are scheduled and", "50:48", "everything like that and then you'll", "50:49", "basically be reassigned to the needs of", "50:51", "the army or which probably meant I was", "50:55", "going back to IT which was what I joined", "50:57", "the army", "50:58", "kind of escape or you can go out on this", "51:03", "special kind of discharge that's called", "51:04", "an

that if you take it", "51:46", "administrative discharge it exempts the", "51:49", "army for liability for your injuries so", "51:52", "actually what I thought was a kindness", "51:54", "was just you know now if I had future", "51:56", "problems with my legs they wouldn't have", "51:59", "to cover it or health insurance on any", "52:00", "of those things anyways it was just a", "52:02", "funny

phase", "53:00", "because what we talked about earlier", "53:02", "with September 11th and how the", "53:04", "intelligence community change they no", "53:07", "longer cared that I hadn't graduated", "53:09", "from college right and I had gotten", "53:11", "GED just by going in and taking a test", "53:13", "so for government purposes it was the", "53:16", "same as if I was a high school graduate",

I come up with this idea", "65:34", "for a new system called the heartbeat", "65:36", "and what the heartbeat is gonna do is", "65:41", "connect to basically every information", "65:45", "repository
