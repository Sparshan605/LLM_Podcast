"there's going to be some sort of a", "88:01", "merger between virtual reality and", "88:04", "robots like that would be like the the", "88:07", "real ultimate brothel so you wouldn't be", "88:10",

"probably where people are gonna go yeah", "88:52", "I think so and then the other question", "88:54", "is like what happens with that", "88:57", "technology in terms of Education and", "88:59", "college and how people acquire skills", "89:03", "and knowledge and insight it's really", "89:06", "really hard to imagine that people still", "89:08", "think in 15 years okay going to a", "89:11", "physical classroom and sitting you know", "89:14", "listening to the average Community", "89:16", "College like adjunct professor mm-hmm", "89:19", "you know talking about human sexuality", "89:23", "or gender feminism or political science", "89:25", "that they'll think that's the state of", "89:27", "the art that's the way we should do that", "89:28", "and and then what happens I mean it", "89:35", "seems kind of unlikely that universities", "89:39", "as we know them will keep existing in", "89:42", "anything close to their current form and", "89:45", "yet no one's talking about this hmm like", "89:50", "I wouldn't be that surprised at half the", "89:52", "universities in America go bankrupt", "89:54", "within 15-20 years so do you think that", "89:57", "people are going to be getting their", "89:58", "education in some sort of an online form", "90:00", "some sort of virtual classroom form or", "90:02", "some may be new not yet created version", "90:07", "some new virtual

has been saying about his", "90:18", "neural link a bit yeah yeah yeah what do", "90:22", "you think about what you've heard so far", "90:23", "I think it'll be very very hard", "90:27", "technically to do that but what if what", "90:31", "do you know about it um if you can", "90:33", "explain to people they don't know what", "90:34", "we're talking about", "90:35", "if I understand correctly having watched", "90:38", "like you interviewee lon etc he's just", "90:42", "concerned that the bandwidth that", "90:44", "connects the brain to the world or the", "90:46", "brain to the Internet is quite narrow", "90:49", "like you can get a lot of information", "90:51", "quickly through your eyes and ears but", "90:53", "your speed of like typing and", "90:55", "controlling things is or speaking is", "90:58", "kind of limited so I think there's a", "91:02", "push to kind of open up that that", "91:05", "bandwidth and the speed of communication", "91:07", "between human brain and digital reality", "91:10", "and other people if they figure out a", "91:14", "way to do that it's a total game changer", "91:18", "in terms of how people interact with not", "91:24", "just social media but in general with", "91:26", "each other I mean it means basically you", "91:28", "have a global telepathy system if you", "91:32", "want and then everything changes because", "91:37", "it means the ease with which one part of", "91:41", "my brain communicates with another part", "91:43", "isn't that much higher than these with", "91:46", "which that part communicates with", "91:47", "somebody else's other brain part what", "91:52", "I've been thinking about is some sort of", "91:53", "universal language and that if that's if", "91:56", "they bridge the gap between cultures and", "92:00", "civilizations and the way people", "92:02", "communicate and doing so do it through", "92:04", "some sort of a digital interface and", "92:06", "instead of like very simple characters", "92:08", "that equal words that you put into your", "92:11", "linguistic dictionary and you have an", "92:14", "understanding of what this person's", "92:15", "talking about instead of that you get", "92:16", "like real clear concepts maybe even like", "92:19", "in emoji form a hieroglyphic form or", "92:23", "some sort of form where we figure out", "92:26", "over X amount of years how to", "92:28", "communicate through agreed-upon imagery", "92:32", "or agreed-upon data in some sort of a", "92:35", "way that lets people express emotions", "92:37", "and and perhaps even more engrossing and", "92:42", "more complicated than the actual", "92:45", "language that we're enjoying right now", "92:46", "yeah", "92:47", "it'll be amazing I mean the evolutionary", "92:50", "backstory to this right as you basically", "92:52", "have the whole history of life on Earth", "92:54", "you know before humans invent language", "92:57", "where animal communication is pretty", "93:01", "primitive like all you really have at", "93:05", "the most complicated is like", "93:06", "Nightingale's producing complicated", "93:08", "birdsong to attract mates that's about", "93:11", "as much as you get", "93:12", "what about like chimps that have certain", "93:14", "sounds for Tigers and other sounds for", "93:16", "Eagles they have like a maximum of maybe", "93:18", "a dozen different sounds but with human", "93:21", "language it compared to that it really", "93:25", "is suddenly like having telepathy where", "93:27", "you can communicate so much so quickly", "93:29", "so efficiently and yet you know if", "93:35", "neural link works it would be as far in", "93:38", "advance of language as languages of kind", "93:41", "of animal signaling whoa and it's hard", "93:44", "it's hard to imagine what that world", "93:46", "looks like because you know imagine a", "93:52", "form of Twitter where it's not just", "93:55", "through your you know your thumbs on a", "93:59", "keypad but it's a direct brain interface", "94:02", "and then when people it's not just", "94:08", "saying something mean or stupid it's", "94:10", "even thinking something mean or stupid", "94:12", "that could immediately get posted hmm", "94:15", "and once you kind of start sharing your", "94:19", "whole subconscious with people through", "94:24", "neural link then you know we'll have to", "94:28", "level up with some new social norms", "94:30", "about what what that means and sort of", "94:33", "how much radical honesty we can take", "94:36", "from each other that seems to be where", "94:39", "the future is the complete the", "94:43", "dissolving of all boundaries between", "94:45", "people and information people and their", "94:48", "lives and that some sort of a way of", "94:54", "recording your actual experiences or", "94:57", "letting people share them in real time", "94:59", "like imagine if pee", "95:00", "we'll decided to let people through some", "95:03", "virtual reality scenario

the concern it's that's actually", "102:11", "more of a concern to me than like", "102:14", "military spying in the strict sense", "102:17", "because I think China has so many people", "102:22",

what can you not", "103:59", "research like they have different", "104:03", "constraints and Americans do but on at", "104:05", "the pragmatic level there are certain", "104:10", "topics that they can

and I", "104:20", "again I think American citizens have no", "104:22", "idea how restricted American scientists", "104:26", "are and kind of what we're allowed to", "104:27", "study allowed to or what you can get", "104:32", "grants and approval for and is that the", "104:35", "same thing as allowed to effectively", "104:37", "it's the same thing because you if you", "104:38", "don't have any funding you're not gonna", "104:40", "be there's nobody you can't do science", "104:42", "without money right and in fact like if", "104:49", "I was starting my career again at this", "104:51", "point I wouldn't go into academia if I", "104:53", "wanted to understand human behavior I", "104:54", "would go work for Facebook or Google", "104:57", "because they have much more data about", "105:00",

"105:11", "don't publish journal papers it's all", "105:13", "it's all commercial secrets so what I'm", "105:18", "sure that like Facebook understands a", "105:22", "lot more about social psychology than", "105:24", "social psychology does at this point", "105:27", "really yeah how could they not they have", "105:30", "like 1.2 billion people interacting", "105:34", "socially regularly and they data mined", "105:37", "the hell out of that for commercial", "105:39", "purposes right but are they publishing", "105:40", "things are they sharing this information", "105:42", "don't turn all I'm sure it's all", "105:44", "internal but internally do you think", "105:46", "they're publishing things I don't know", "105:50", "that's the thing yeah", "105:52", "it's just a little bit alarming when", "105:54", "this state-of-the-art and understanding", "105:57", "behavior isn't public that is alarming", "106:02", "and then Mark Zuckerberg might be a", "106:05", "robot too right everybody's worried", "106:07", "about that might be a sexpot we've we", "106:10", "played many times a video of him", "106:11", "drinking water I don't know a Jew to", "106:13", "drinks water like that crazy little fuck", "106:16", "it's uh just kidding mark don't believe", "106:19", "my account I think that we're looking at", "106:23", "in terms of like Google and Facebook and", "106:27", "Twitter and even YouTube we're looking", "106:29", "at these enormous organizations that I", "106:34", "don't think they had any idea what they", "106:36", "were going to be you know and I really", "106:39", "particularly feel that way about Twitter", "106:41", "when Twitter first started out do you", "106:44", "remember how it used to be like you", "106:46", "would use like you're at like at jeffrey", "106:49", "miller is enjoying a cup of coffee yeah", "106:51", "you you would talk about yourself in the", "106:53", "third person it was really weird you", "106:55", "know at Jamie Vernon is going to the", "106:58", "movies and that's how people talked the", "107:01", "early days of Twitter and then people", "107:03", "realize what the fuck am i doing you had", "107:06", "that's sort of the reason it developed", "107:07", "is because there was no group texting", "107:09", "back then in 2007 or six when this", "107:11", "started so it was developed for group", "107:13", "texting so you could share what you were", "107:16", "doing with a group of your friends", "107:17", "mm-hmm was that what it was for they", "107:18", "opened it so that more people could", "107:20", "follow if you wanted to and then", "107:21", "celebrities jumped on and then it ran", "107:24", "and they like they started adding the", "107:25", "ability people just started doing at Joe", "107:27", "Rogan yeah so they'd like added the", "107:29", "ability that to click that and share it", "107:31", "and tag it yeah so weird and then you", "107:35", "think about it now now it's a vehicle", "107:37", "for the president to threaten other", "107:38", "countries and it is the it's the global", "107:42", "public forum and particularly in America", "107:44", "it is that the public square where", "107:46", "everyone shares ideas and well it's a", "107:48", "less verbose version of Facebook", "107:50", "probably Facebook is you just can write", "107:52", "too much I can't keep up with you bro", "107:54",

how", "108:53", "humans would make use of this new", "108:54", "technology yeah like nobody in", "108:56", "psychology was talking about oh twitter", "108:59", "is going to radically transform the way", "109:01", "that science operates for example news", "109:06", "of like failed replications will be", "109:10", "spread within three days to everybody in", "109:13", "a field and anybody who does scientific", "109:16", "misconduct will be suddenly like pushed", "109:21", "out within a week or a new result will", "109:25", "be shared globally within 24 hours", "109:29", "nobody was thinking about that hmm so", "109:32", "there's like science Twitter politics", "109:34", "Twitter entertainment Twitter and", "109:37", "they've all kind of changed the game in", "109:40", "their respective fields and we didn't", "109:44", "understand human nature well enough to", "109:46", "predict how people would actually used", "109:47", "this stuff yeah we did just didn't see", "109:52", "it coming

all these different systems detailed", "112:51", "detailed from anyone you want to watch", "112:54", "now almost because they even had like", "112:56", "the master class you could learn", "112:57", "screenwriting from Aaron Sorkin right", "112:59", "I'm directing from who yeah Ron Howard", "113:01", "or whatever it is you didn't have that", "113:03", "ten years ago yeah and then in terms of", "113:06", "financial I mean the amount of financial", "113:09", "strain that getting into traditional", "113:11", "education puts on people and they get", "113:14", "out of school and they're saddled

"half-assed Michigan University I think", "113:47", "it's unconscionable yeah it's terrible I", "113:49", "mean I feel really morally conflicted", "113:52", "about working in an industry that I", "113:54", "think is pretty exploitative in a lot of", "113:57", "ways I was gonna ask you about that", "113:59", "like what what's the stance that you", "114:02", "take I mean if a kid comes to you and", "114:05", "says you know I don't know what to do", "114:07", "here we generally the stance I take so", "114:13", "in in a way I'm I'm lucky because I work", "114:15", "at a large state public university and", "114:19", "tuition is really pretty do you want to", "114:21", "say which one is the University of New", "114:24", "Mexico and it's great we serve forty", "114:27", "thousand students and we charge very", "114:29", "very little tuition money compared to", "114:31", "most places because it's state", "114:33", "subsidized and if you keep up a certain", "114:36", "grade point average it's about as close", "114:39", "to free as you can you can get in", "114:42", "America", "114:42", "so I don't feel like we're as", "114:45", "economically exploitative as if I was", "114:47", "like teaching at Middlebury College or", "114:49", "Yale or whatever mm-hmm", "114:51", "but still you know if undergrads come to", "114:57", "me and they go what what should I learn", "114:59", "what should i major in what classes", "115:01", "should I take the only real advice I can", "115:04", "give is like take stuff that's going to", "115:06", "be useful in your life your personal", "115:08",

imagine", "146:14", "that's incredibly immersive like how how", "146:17", "could they do something like that", "146:18", "oh the new discovery mode turns on", "146:20", "Assassin's Creed origins is doing", "146:22", "interactive history lessons like ancient", "146:24", "Egypt I believe is what they do here and", "146:26", "it's like deep detail creation of it you", "146:30", "go through it and it take for this mode", "146:32", "they kind of take all the shoot and", "146:34", "that's shooting but stabbing and killing", "146:35", "the people and just walk you through age", "146:37", "in Egypt Cairo you get to see people die", "146:39", "not in this mode maybe they did they", "146:42", "might show some stuff of did whatnot but", "146:44", "so you could either have a graphic or", "146:46", "non graphic is that the idea yeah then", "146:47", "they could show you through the map take", "146:49", "you to play of a video this can I watch", "146:51", "this I need to see this okay yeah I mean", "146:57", "that would be the best way to teach", "146:59", "people things to make some sort of", "147:02", "interactive environment especially", "147:05", "virtual where you could go there and", "147:08", "experience it and I mean I don't know if", "147:11", "you've messed around with any of the HTC", "147:13", "vive things", "147:14", "oh is this here yeah it's like go", "147:16", "fullscreen with this whoa-ho this is", "147:20", "this is part of the game", "147:22", "but this is not the actual game this is", "147:24", "like a mode they did to teach kids", "147:25", "because they had all of this technology", "147:28", "available so they said you know what", "147:30", "just get a narrator add some audio clips", "147:33", "make it a mode and they even have it the", "147:38", "way it was originally built the Great", "147:40", "Pyramid with the limestone still", "147:42", "attached for the most part this is a", "147:45", "20-minute video so this is like this is", "147:47", "real deep detail man just like the best", "147:50", "Graham Hancock you know explanation you", "147:52", "could get but you're the guy there and", "147:55", "you're in a third-person position you", "147:58", "probably could go first person to I'm", "147:59", "sure and wow this is just this", "148:02", "particular part they're going to keep", "148:04", "doing this as you know this Assassin's", "148:07", "Creed has gone through all sorts of", "148:08", "different modes of history through there", "148:10", "like Renaissance Rome Spain all sorts of", "148:14", "different areas and now that they sort", "148:15", "of turn this on it's gonna well that to", "148:20", "me seems like a really good idea in", "148:22", "terms of getting kids excited about", "148:25", "learning things having some sort of an", "148:27", "interactive game yeah just game up game", "148:30", "if I every topic yeah every in a really", "148:32", "high-quality way yeah and I think the", "148:35", "tricky thing with you know education is", "148:38", "the kind of tech that we use is several", "148:42", "steps behind this state of the art in", "148:45", "Hollywood special-effects or", "148:47", "documentaries or this this kind of game", "148:51", "so students are kind of disappointed", "148:54", "when they come to class right and it's", "148:56", "like college is really expensive and", "149:00", "it's really retrograde in terms of the", "149:02", "tech quality so why why are we here we", "149:10", "should be on the forefront right it", "149:13", "should be possible to go to your state", "149:15", "university and see awesome gamified", "149:18", "interactive stuff so you don't have", "149:20", "access to at home but everything is", "149:22", "changing so fast and in order for the", "149:24", "curriculum to keep up with modern", "149:26", "technology you would have to revamp", "149:28", "every year well I mean a lot of the", "149:31", "content we teach", "149:33", "is pretty old actually mmm like the key", "149:37", "idea is in evolutionary biology many of", "149:40", "them go back 50 100 years key ideas in", "149:43", "animal behavior or paleontology or", "149:48", "anthropology it's not like those get", "149:51", "updated that fast it's just what the way", "149:54", "you can present them technically we're", "149:58", "not competitive and that's embarrassing", "150:02", "a certain way to change that or is that", "150:06", "that seems almost insurmountable without", "150:09", "a complete overhaul of the system I", "150:10", "think you need a

and it's very", "150:31", "uninteresting yes yeah I think it's", "150:34", "inevitable that that'll happen and", "150:36", "that's probably gonna be what bankrupts", "150:38", "and I think it's gonna eat our lunch", "150:41", "yeah", "150:42", "what do you how do you feel about that", "150:44", "though as a person who makes their", "150:45", "living do I mean I'll see you write", "150:46", "books and I'd be happy to jump ship and", "150:49", "go do that would you oh yeah good for", "150:51", "you if I could like teach hundreds of", "150:54", "thousands or millions of people rather", "150:56", "than write 200 at a time well that's", "150:59", "essentially what Jordan Peterson is", "151:00", "doing yeah exactly but he's not doing it", "151:02", "through a virtual thing he's doing it", "151:04", "through video lectures and then physical", "151:07", "lectures it's really fascinating to see", "151:09", "the reaction to him and now to sam", "151:11", "harris is doing this as well and not the", "151:13", "videos but he's definitely doing the the", "151:16", "live sort of performances and know who", "151:21", "would have ever thought there would be a", "151:22", "place where public intellectuals would", "151:24", "go and 5,000 people would sell out like", "151:28", "that and go to see them like they would", "151:30", "go to see fucking Kevin Hart or", "151:32", "something it's crazy yeah well you know", "151:35", "when Alfred Kinsey first started doing a", "151:37", "sex surveys and he would go around the", "151:39", "country giving lectures like he filled", "151:42", "up a four thousand person Stadium and UC", "151:45", "Berkeley", "151:46", "just presenting the first real data on", "151:48", "human sexuality back in late 40s Wow", "151:52", "and so there was why because there's a", "151:54", "real hunger for that because it was", "151:56", "something students couldn't get anywhere", "151:58", "else and the same was true back in the", "152:01", "eighteen hundreds when you had famous", "152:03", "authors touring America like Mark Twain", "152:06", "mm-hmm", "152:07", "many people think is the founder of", "152:09", "stand-up comedy yeah yeah right and they", "152:13", "would use humor like Jordan Peterson Sam", "152:16", "Harris you and they would speak in the", "152:22", "register of the people not pretentious", "152:24", "academic jargon Sam is surprisingly", "152:28", "funny I was told that we had dinner", "152:30", "recently and we were talking and I said", "152:33", "dude you're really funny like those", "152:35", "those little side notes and asides you", "152:38", "throw out little funny quips like this", "152:41", "is like stand-up comedy type stuff when", "152:43", "someone will say something like like", "152:45", "even with you though you guys were", "152:46", "talking about polyamory I mean and there", "152:49", "was he through some sort of a Java how's", "152:51", "that working out ya know it's a very dry", "152:54",

technology in", "153:06", "terms of video games is going to help", "153:07", "you absorb information about ancient", "153:09", "Egypt and humor is gonna help just make", "153:12", "the time go by better and make the whole", "153:15", "experience less flat yeah so I think I", "153:20", "think that's a future and I think within", "153:22", "10 years a lot of young people are just", "153:26", "gonna realize if I can actually learn", "153:29", "more from some alternative system some", "153:33", "franchise of really good gamified", "153:36", "instruction plus great presenters you", "153:39", "have a sense of humor and are smart and", "153:41", "and kind of like heterodox and and edgy", "153:46", "they're gonna flock to that the main", "153:48", "thing is that business that franchise", "153:53", "would have to provide a credential that", "153:55", "actually separates them from people who", "153:58", "don't have it and that", "154:00", "it's performance in companies or in the",

way to", "154:17", "make it so that like if you've got a", "154:20", "degree from this whatever st. marys", "154:24", "university that that is really a better", "154:27", "predictor of doing well in a job or", "154:30", "marriage right than a Yale degree then", "154:36", "suddenly the whole business model", "154:37", "changes for universities well it's", "154:40", "really fascinating when you think about", "154:41", "the history of education is that our", "154:43", "ideas about these gigantic institutions", "154:46", "whether it's Yale or Harvard is that", "154:47", "they've been long

you're just really you only", "155:01", "have a certain amount of years where", "155:03", "these things were even a real thing yeah", "155:06", "and that I mean the idea that you have a", "155:08",
