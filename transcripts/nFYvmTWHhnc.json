were", "18:39", "trying to pass guard and they were", "18:41", "pushing down and I'm like you never want", "18:42", "to turn your shoulder like that because", "18:44", "I had explained to them the arm

laughing and they're", "18:53", "girls you know so you're watching these", "18:55", "like eight year old girls having the", "18:57", "best time like choking each other and", "19:00", "everything and going through these", "19:01", "motions and to me I mean I think it's", "19:04", "fucking awesome man these kids do it all", "19:06", "the time no one's getting hurt they're", "19:07", "having a great time with each other and", "19:09", "it's just this primal release like let's", "19:12", "get all that shit out of there and then", "19:14", "you could be civil yeah well even if", "19:16", "there's no jujitsu instruction involved", "19:18", "and there's no mats around and you take", "19:20", "two kids and you put them in the yard", "19:23", "eventually they're gonna start wrestling", "19:25", "with each other channel these boys yeah", "19:27", "boys for sure yes for sure I was at a", "19:29", "party once with my kids and these two", "19:31", "boys started going at it and neither one", "19:33", "of them at any training you could tell", "19:34", "but it's just natural like they they're", "19:36", "getting their hips low and they're", "19:38", "trying to push each other they're trying", "19:39", "to figure it out and neither one of them", "19:41", "knew what to do I kind of wanted to go", "19:43", "up and start coaching them but they're", "19:45", "just playing in the grass I didn't want", "19:46", "you know it's like it's it's fascinating", "19:48", "to see just natural human instincts yeah", "19:52", "and that's the other thing I've noticed", "19:53", "in teaching kids jujitsu is the kids", "19:57", "that are a little bit more cerebral your", "19:59", "your you know the parents will think", "20:00", "well you know my son he's kind of a nerd", "20:02", "he's kind of a smart kid I don't know if", "20:03", "he's gonna like this but the opposite is", "20:05", "actually true very often where the kid", "20:08", "that's cerebral he'll recognize as soon", "20:10", "as you've shown three things like you", "20:12", "said his wheels are turned he's going to", "20:13", "wait a second this is this is a skill I", "20:15", "can learn and if I know this then and", "20:17", "the other guy doesn't know this I'll be", "20:19", "able to beat them and so cerebral kids", "20:21", "often get into it even more than then", "20:25", "you know some kid that's just kind of a", "20:26", "natural bruiser oh yeah don't mean tenth", "20:28", "planet jiu-jitsu is filled with nerds", "20:31", "they're all nerds the assassin nerds", "20:34", "it's really kind of interesting is and", "20:36", "and you're you're not being facetious", "20:39", "when you use the word assassin nerds", "20:41", "because you know this is you know if you", "20:43", "go back before you knew jujitsu before I", "20:45", "knew you did too before I knew jujitsu", "20:47", "and you know I was a big Navy SEAL two", "20:50", "hundred pounds one of those kids that's", "20:52", "145 pounds would absolutely have", "20:54", "destroyed me if we got new fight boom", "20:56", "take my back put me to sleep you know", "20:57", "what I mean I I might you know put up an", "20:59", "OK fight and hit him one time in the", "21:02", "side of the head and then he's in on my", "21:04", "back and put me to sleep that's the", "21:05", "reality nerd assassins coming at you", "21:08", "strong well it is I mean it's a complex", "21:11", "game of kinetic chess I mean it's more", "21:14", "complex than chess because you know in", "21:16", "chess you've got these different pieces", "21:18", "and they're restricted in their", "21:19", "movements jiu-jitsu is not restricted in", "21:21", "its movement and that every transition", "21:23", "has so many different possibilities and", "21:25", "so many different setups there's so many", "21:27", "different times you get led one way and", "21:29", "then just to get you to defend so that", "21:31", "they can establish a second position and", "21:33", "they get you to defend that so they can", "21:35", "establish a third position yeah", "21:37", "and that part of it is is what I think", "21:40", "really for me transferred from jujitsu", "21:43", "to not only to the battlefield but to", "21:45", "life as well because the big thing in", "21:48", "jiu-jitsu from my perspective is that", "21:49", "you don't go strength against strength", "21:51", "right if I don't if I'm trying to choke", "21:54", "you I don't try and choke you overtly I", "21:56", "don't just grab your neck no I work on", "21:58", "your arm and I put pressure over here", "22:00", "and I pass your guard and then I", "22:01", "eventually while you're thinking about", "22:03", "something else boom that", "22:04", "I grabbed your neck or that's when I", "22:05", "grabbed your arm and that's what I think", "22:07", "on the battlefield you know you can't", "22:09", "you just don't attack hardened positions", "22:11", "of the enemy and in life you know if", "22:13", "you're trying to be a leader you're", "22:14", "trying to step up and lead somebody you", "22:16", "don't just come down and bark orders at", "22:18", "people because that's not as effective", "22:20", "as maneuvering and adjusting your", "22:23", "position and getting in a better", "22:25", "position and then getting that person to", "22:27", "give you what you want instead of trying", "22:29", "to take it from them yeah that's a", "22:30", "really important lesson for Parenthood", "22:33", "like you can't just tell kids what to do", "22:35", "you know like to just do it cuz I told", "22:37", "you do it they like fuck you I'm gonna", "22:38", "be a hooker yeah yeah and that applies", "22:43", "not only to kids that your your honor", "22:45", "percent applies to kids but applies to", "22:46", "adults as well and that is people need", "22:48", "to understand why they're doing what", "22:49", "they're doing it and you know if I want", "22:50", "you to go take down some building and", "22:52", "capture some bad guy I don't go hey hey", "22:54", "Joe I want you to take down this", "22:56", "building once your pack captures bad guy", "22:57", "these the guys I want you to take with", "22:58", "you here's the route I want you to take", "22:59", "in here's the methodology I want you to", "23:01", "use for the clearance because then when", "23:02", "I send you to go do that mission it's", "23:04", "not your mission it's my mission I came", "23:06", "up with a plan you didn't so you might", "23:08", "be you might have thought there was a", "23:09", "better way to do it or you might had a", "23:11", "different idea of how to get it done and", "23:12", "now when you go out there and you meet", "23:14", "some kind of resistance whether it's an", "23:15", "obstacle you didn't expect or whether", "23:17", "it's some scenario that you didn't", "23:18", "foresee instead of you trying to", "23:20", "overcome it you just blame me you just", "23:21", "look ahead Jocko came up with a stupid", "23:23", "plan and here we are it's failing forget", "23:25", "it we're going back we're not going to", "23:26", "carry out the mission whereas if I said", "23:28", "hey Joe here's what I want you to do go", "23:31", "figure out the best way to do it and now", "23:33", "you come up with a plan and now you make", "23:35", "up all the methodology of how you're", "23:36", "gonna get it done and you decide who", "23:37", "you're going to take with you now it's", "23:39", "your plan you own that plan and when you", "23:41", "go out in the field and you meet a", "23:42", "little resistance guess what you do you", "23:44", "say I'm gonna find a way around it I'm", "23:45", "going to overcome this I'm gonna", "23:46", "overcome that obstacle to make it happen", "23:48", "and that's another piece of leadership", "23:50", "and it's the exact same thing with kids", "23:51", "if you tell your kid you know you will", "23:53", "get good grades in school that means", "23:56", "nothing to them but if you explain to", "23:58", "them hey I would love for you to get", "24:00", "good grades and here's why it's gonna", "24:01", "open opportunities for you in the future", "24:02", "it's gonna allow you to be able to", "24:04", "outsmart people because you have more", "24:06", "knowledge than them and then you're", "24:07", "gonna be able to end up making more", "24:09", "money which is actually give you more", "24:10", "freedom in the long run instead of doing", "24:11", "a job that you don't want to do you", "24:13", "explain all those things to a kid it's", "24:15", "going to be a lot more successful than", "24:16", "just do", "24:17", "I told you get good grades because I", "24:18", "said so now when you do these", "24:20", "conferences were when you you speak it", "24:22", "at businesses and they bring you in to", "24:25", "sort of you have these leadership media", "24:29", "would you call them yeah their", "24:30", "leadership seminars seminars yeah now", "24:32", "when you have these seminars are these", "24:34", "some of the principles that you discuss", "24:36", "when you talk about absolutely yeah", "24:37", "absolutely because that's another", "24:39", "another big piece of this is that all", "24:41", "this ideas about interacting with human", "24:44", "beings they just don't change like", "24:45", "there's little variance but whether", "24:47", "you're dealing with kids or whether", "24:48", "you're dealing with adults and whether", "24:49", "you're dealing with business people", "24:50", "whether you're dealing with soldiers on", "24:52", "the battlefield the leadership", "24:54", "principles they don't change and", "24:55", "therefore you can whether you're trying", "24:58", "to get people to go out and capture and", "25:00", "kill a bad guy or whether you're trying", "25:01", "to get them to build some product and", "25:04", "sell it the principles of leadership", "25:06", "don't change you're still trying to get", "25:08", "a bunch of totally independent people", "25:11", "right and that's one of the myths we", "25:12", "have to overcome a lot because everyone", "25:14", "thinks oh and the military ones just", "25:15", "like a robot and that's just not true", "25:16", "everybody in the military is free", "25:19", "theater people they're people they're", "25:20", "free thinking people they're gonna come", "25:21", "up with our own ideas they're gonna have", "25:22", "their own agendas and they're gonna", "25:23", "think of ways to do things that they", "25:26", "think are better than yours", "25:27", "so you can have all these independent", "25:28", "free thinkers and you got to get them on", "25:30", "board with the same plan to you to go", "25:32", "out and execute and so it doesn't matter", "25:34", "if you're on the battlefield in business", "25:36", "that's what that's what you're trying to", "25:37", "get done and the leadership principles", "25:38", "don't change to me that's as a person", "25:41", "who's never been in the military that's", "25:42", "it's one of the fascinating aspects of", "25:43", "how it works is like how how do you get", "25:47", "all these different people to follow", "25:49", "through on a plan and who are the", "25:51", "leaders and why do the leaders have the", "25:52", "right ideas and who educates them as to", "25:55", "how to have the right idea to having the", "25:57", "right ideas like I know that a lot of", "25:59", "people are excited about where the", "26:01", "military is right now like Tim Kennedy", "26:02", "re-enlisted yeah and he got a lesson", "26:04", "yeah he relisted because he believes", "26:06", "that the military has support now and", "26:08", "look Tim Kennedy's believes he's put on", "26:09", "this earth to kill bad guys that's what", "26:12", "he wants to do me I think I agree with", "26:13", "Tim Kennedy I think I agree with him too", "26:15", "for sure obviously he enjoys it heavy", "26:19", "he's not fucking around he went back in", "26:22", "he put his his money where his mouth is", "26:24", "and in his eyes that this is you know", "26:28", "this is the way", "26:30", "it should have been that you should give", "26:32", "the military the chance to do their job", "26:34", "that's their idea and then other people", "26:36", "believe that there should be much more", "26:37", "civilian oversight and there should be", "26:39", "much more much more checks and balances", "26:41", "before things get done this is a great", "26:44", "debate it's going on today well I think", "26:46", "there's two different things that you", "26:47", "just talked about that is what the", "26:50", "military gets told to do and how they do", "26:52", "it and those are two different things", "26:54", "and III think that yes you absolutely", "26:56", "the civilians should control and do", "26:59", "control the military by the way they do", "27:01", "control the the civilians are unwritten", "27:03", "or the military's under control", "27:04", "civilians and yet once you say okay this", "27:07", "is what we want to have happen you need", "27:09", "to let the military professionals figure", "27:11", "out how they're going to go and make it", "27:13", "happen yeah that's that's where it gets", "27:15", "tricky right because if you're in like", "27:18", "one of the things that was explained to", "27:20", "me by a friend of Navy SEAL he was", "27:22", "saying that when something needs to get", "27:24", "done and you have all these people that", "27:27", "are telling you how you can do it how", "27:30", "you can't do it that if people that are", "27:32", "not in experiencing combat and don't", "27:35", "understand what what could or could not", "27:37", "go sideways like to put more problems in", "27:41", "place or to put more checks and balances", "27:43", "in place you're actually going to put", "27:44", "these people in more danger that that is", "27:46", "true yeah you should like I said if you", "27:49", "let the civilians decide what it is that", "27:51", "needs to be accomplished and then the", "27:53", "military leaders decide how they're", "27:55", "going to go ahead and make that that", "27:57", "happen and I mean it goes back to it", "27:59", "goes back to Vietnam you know there was", "28:00", "too much civilian oversight of what was", "28:02", "happening in Vietnam and the military", "28:05", "leaders were they didn't really have the", "28:09", "the wherewithal not even the wherewithal", "28:11", "they didn't have the free rein to go out", "28:13", "and try and make things happen the way", "28:14", "they want to do and it ended up in a big", "28:15", "quagmire well Vietnam seems like to me", "28:18", "from an outsider to be one of the most", "28:19", "fucked up wars ever absolutely it didn't", "28:22", "totally make sense that it was happening", "28:24", "and then now we know that the gulf of", "28:26", "gulf of tonkin was very likely a false", "28:29", "flag and that there was some sort of", "28:31", "motivation to get there in the first", "28:32", "place and then you're dealing with", "28:33", "guerrilla warfare for the first time", "28:35", "ever in US history like they didn't", "28:36", "exactly know how to handle this no we", "28:39", "didn't and we didn't adapt very well to", "28:42", "what was", "28:43", "on the ground which is always going to", "28:44", "be problematic if you have close-minded", "28:46", "people in the military if people are", "28:49", "close mind that you're not going to be", "28:50", "able

"drastically from this big conventional", "28:59", "force that we went up there to fight", "29:01", "against Saddam's big army well once that", "29:03", "fell apart then what happened now the", "29:05", "sudden we were facing guerrillas again", "29:06", "and an insurgency and it took us several", "29:08", "years to change our strategy from we", "29:11", "didn't even know what to do oh my god", "29:13", "you know what do we do there's all these", "29:14", "people running around what do we do with", "29:15", "these all these people running around", "29:16", "and how do we get these people under", "29:18", "control and and the civilians want us", "29:20", "here and and yet if we don't do the", "29:22", "right thing now the civilians don't want", "29:23", "us here what do we need to do so it took", "29:25", "us some time to adjust our strategy in", "29:27", "Iraq and luckily we had some good", "29:29", "leaders that went ahead and made those", "29:31", "changes isn't it also that when when", "29:35", "you're in war and though the strategy", "29:36", "and not the strategy but the motivation", "29:38", "is very clear like if you fight against", "29:39", "Hitler's army in World War two yeah this", "29:41", "is very clear that you're dealing with", "29:42", "an evil force whereas in Vietnam it's", "29:45", "like wait a minute why are we here like", "29:47", "what's going on the organism what's", "29:48", "happening extremely extremely", "29:51", "challenging no doubt and that that is", "29:55", "why and you know I've talked about this", "29:57", "before if if

talked about that you have to have to", "30:10", "execute this war you got to have you got", "30:12", "to have the will to kill people and", "30:15", "again I say this all time no one wants", "30:17",

thing in war so you have to have", "30:48", "the will to kill people of course it's", "30:51", "easy to have the will to kill the bad", "30:52", "guys but then you have to accept the", "30:54", "fact that some innocent", "30:55", "people are going to die and that is", "30:57", "going to be awful and then on the other", "30:58", "side of the coin is of course if you're", "31:01", "going to send people or people Americans", "31:03", "are going to die and there's nothing you", "31:05", "can do about it you have to accept that", "31:07", "fact and you know that's why Vietnam was", "31:10",

"31:18", "way we needed to this is a nightmare", "31:21", "I agree with you hundred percent what do", "31:22", "you think about transparency like when", "31:25", "the Bush administration wouldn't let", "31:26", "them take photographs of coffins and and", "31:30", "send them home like a lot of people are", "31:31", "really upset because there's a lot of", "31:33", "people that felt like look Americans", "31:35", "should know that there's a cost to this", "31:37", "and they should know that there's", "31:38", "consequences to these actions and they", "31:41", "were saying that these consequences and", "31:42", "knowing about these consequences could", "31:44", "lessen morale could lessen support back", "31:47", "at home when they really need it that", "31:48", "people didn't really need to know this", "31:49", "that what they need to know is we're on", "31:51", "the right track and we're doing well", "31:52", "yeah that's a tough one and whether it's", "31:55", "the right decision to keep the Americans", "31:57", "in their beautiful bubble that they live", "31:58", "in and let them know that this war is", "32:00", "happening but you don't have to see the", "32:02",

"32:20", "needed some money and one of the first", "32:22", "times that they released a lot of", "32:25", "pictures of American dead Americans was", "32:28", "I think it was the Battle of Tarawa and", "32:30", "there was all these Americans washing up", "32:32", "on the beach I mean Marines that had", "32:34", "drowned and got shot and it was awful", "32:36", "but they did it for a reason they did it", "32:38", "to show like hey this is real this is", "32:40", "happening we need to put pitch in we", "32:42", "need money we need to you know save save", "32:45", "meet save don't use your cars we all", "32:50", "need to get in for the big win right and", "32:52", "that's the opposite of what we're", "32:54", "talking about when they're saying hey", "32:55", "you're not allowed to take pictures of", "32:56", "dead americans that are being killed and", "32:59", "you know i think there should be some", "33:00", "level of transparency there when you", "33:03", "should America should see what is", "33:05", "happening what is the cost because it's", "33:07", "real easy for Americans to", "33:08", "to sit there and allow these young kids", "33:10", "to go overseas and fight and die or be",

maybe we", "33:20", "should not only you know maybe we should", "33:22", "not only show pictures of the coffins", "33:24", "that are coming back but maybe we should", "33:26", "explore and show the lives that those", "33:28", "men sacrificed and who they were and", "33:30", "what they did and what their families", "33:32", "are like and their wife and kids and mom", "33:34", "and dad that they left behind that they", "33:36", "gave up and why did they give it up", "33:37", "because they believed in freedom and so", "33:39", "now we're just going to say oh that's", "33:41", "not happening no it's happening and you", "33:42", "need to you need to know it it is kind", "33:45", "of strange right when you think about", "33:46", "how little access to information people", "33:48", "really had back in World War two they", "33:49", "were counting on the news they were", "33:50", "counting on newspapers and now today we", "33:53", "have massive massive access to", "33:55", "information instantaneously but yet you", "33:57", "get less of it when it comes to that", "33:59", "yeah and and in some ways you get more", "34:01", "of it I mean obviously when there's an", "34:02", "incident that happens overseas you can", "34:04", "find out about it on Twitter as fast as", "34:06", "you can find out about it through you", "34:08", "know waiting for a real new source to", "34:10", "come up with it but you don't get", "34:11", "anything that's like specifically", "34:14", "distributed by the US government to let", "34:16", "you know the consequences of a war and", "34:18", "say hey folks we need your support this", "34:20", "is what's really going down these are", "34:21", "American citizens this is what's", "34:23", "happening to them over there yeah and", "34:24", "then the same thing could be said if for", "34:27", "hey sometimes civilians are going to get", "34:29", "killed yeah and what do we do what do we", "34:32", "do then do we brush that under the rug", "34:34", "and we just show the Americans getting", "34:36", "killed or do you universally show what's", "34:38", "happening what war is men war is jacked", "34:41", "up I'm here to tell you war is not", "34:43", "glorious it is not fun and it is it is a", "34:47", "horrible horrible event and so yeah I", "34:50", "think you should expose it and I think", "34:52", "you should expose it at a high level so", "34:54", "that people understand what we're", "34:56", "getting into and as horrible as war is", "34:58", "there's many times throughout history", "35:01", "where war is the absolute in my mind in", "35:04", "my opinion the right thing to do and we", "35:05", "don't have a choice and we need to do", "35:08", "something when when horrible things are", "35:10", "happening and and you know I think", "35:11", "that's you know in my podcast I talk", "35:13", "about like the like I said I talked", "35:15", "about war and death and horrible", "35:17", "genocide and and that's one of the", "35:19", "reasons why I think it's it's gotten the", "35:20", "water", "35:21", "action is because I'm talking about", "35:23", "things that although otherwise being", "35:24", "ignored and I think people do want to", "35:26", "know I think people do want to", "35:27", "understand war at a deeper level so that", "35:30", "way when they hear a politician up there", "35:32", "saying hey we should go to war they can", "35:34", "at least save themselves I know what I", "35:36", "know what he's talking about and he's", "35:38", "not just talking about hey we're gonna", "35:39", "wave the flag we're gonna send some", "35:41", "soldiers over they're gonna kick ass", "35:42", "they're gonna come home we're gonna", "35:43", "high-five that's not what war is and", "35:45", "let's not ever forget that that's not", "35:48", "what war is war is a man and another man", "35:52", "on a battlefield surrounded by people", "35:55", "civilians and they're trying to kill", "35:56", "each other and it's a bloodbath and we", "35:59", "shouldn't forget that and is it", "36:01", "necessary sometimes it absolutely is it", "36:03", "absolutely is necessary sometimes but we", "36:06", "better way are our minds heavily before", "36:09", "we make that decision to go and execute", "36:11", "now when you think about the evolution", "36:13", "of human beings you think about how much", "36:15", "safer it is today versus how it was", "36:17", "thousands of years ago", "36:19", "do you ever foresee a time where war", "36:21", "won't exist I don't know you know people", "36:25", "joke with me a lot about the robot wars", "36:27", "and and robots being able to accomplish", "36:30", "wars I actually believe that thing will", "36:32", "come I mean we've got drones right now", "36:34", "that that are very capable pretty soon", "36:37", "we'll have land warfare robots that will", "36:39", "be able to go in clear buildings and and", "36:41", "make things happen and then will the", "36:43", "enemy then have robots that will fight", "36:46", "our robots at some point yeah and then", "36:49", "at some point will that elevate to a", "36:51", "point where we're not dealing with", "36:52", "physical robots anymore but just the", "36:53", "software behind the robots and now it's", "36:55", "just a big sort of cyber warfare that", "36:58", "that is that seems conceivable to me now", "37:00", "Joe don't mistake me for some kind of", "37:05", "like a Sam Harris intellectual over here", "37:07", "or that I'm going to sit here and", "37:09", "explain to you what the future of you", "37:11", "know warfare from a technical", "37:12", "perspective but from my from my", "37:15", "rudimentary thought process could it not", "37:17", "elevate to a point where we have robots", "37:19", "fighting robots and then that eventually", "37:20", "escalates to a point where it's some", "37:22", "kind of cyber warfare with it's not", "37:24", "physical but it's just information based", "37:25", "that does make sense to me that that", "37:27", "could happen yeah it makes sense to me", "37:29", "too especially when you see those Boston", "37:31", "dynamic robots have you seen those", "37:32", "things", "37:33", "you kick them over", "37:34", "bounce back up they run up hills they", "37:37", "can run like 60 miles an hour they're", "37:39", "freaks I mean it's it's really and what", "37:42", "they're doing now is just I mean who", "37:43", "knows where they're going to be ten", "37:44", "years from now I mean they're going to", "37:46", "be solar-powered the there live out", "37:48", "there with no food yeah it'll be awesome", "37:51", "and then and then then where we go will", "37:54", "those robots fight people for a while", "37:55", "probably people that don't know any", "37:58", "people that don't people don't have good", "37:59", "robots yet yeah and that's not going to", "38:01", "be fun for the people about robots right", "38:03", "and we'll see where it goes from there", "38:06", "yeah I mean I think that's just a", "38:08", "surrender scenario right if you got a if", "38:11", "let's say America has these robots that", "38:13", "can just come in with ruthless precision", "38:17", "and take out bad guys and you know", "38:19", "you're going to be at their mercy", "38:20", "there's a fucking science fiction movie", "38:23", "right like China develops robots that", "38:25", "take over New York City yeah look at", "38:26", "this goddamn thing yeah it's one of", "38:28", "these bosses also bots it's just it's so", "38:31", "weird man to see them moving around yeah", "38:34", "and what's interesting I've seen some", "38:35", "other ones like you don't need they put", "38:38", "all this effort into making it actually", "38:39", "walk instead of have you know wheels or", "38:42", "tracks or whatever the you know wheels", "38:44", "are tracks with little pods that could", "38:45", "get over things would be they want this", "38:47", "to look like for a person for some", "38:48", "reason a human shape is not necessarily", "38:52", "the most effective you know structure", "38:55", "for fighting this not even will for us", "38:57", "right yeah barely yeah I mean what's one", "39:00", "of the reason why our backs are so", "39:01", "fucked up we got you know you can't even", "39:03", "talk us into standing up straight I can", "39:05", "pick up ten pounds okay it's a big deal", "39:07", "oh I'm better than that yeah fuck this", "39:10", "robot someday though what's it's just we", "39:14", "like things that look like us for", "39:16", "whatever reason you know we like the", "39:17", "idea that this thing is going to look", "39:19", "like us but yeah I agree with you it", "39:20", "doesn't need to and should know I'm not", "39:22", "the best and the real the real combat", "39:24", "robots probably won't look like they", "39:25", "won't be bipedal nerd yeah but you know", "39:28", "they won't be by people to probably have", "39:30", "little treads or something and just haul", "39:31", "ass at 60 miles an hour with the machine", "39:33", "gun or they'll have many legs like what", "39:36", "was that one that was like a cheetah", "39:37", "there's some some crazy one that's like", "39:40", "a cheetah and it runs at some fucking", "39:41", "ridiculous speed and it's terrifying", "39:44", "they had one that was on a treadmill", "39:45", "this is the cheetah one", "39:48", "again it's obviously not the best", "39:51", "galloping it's not the best structure", "39:54", "because you have to make this thing up", "39:55", "and run", "39:56", "whereas wheels on it or treads or", "39:58", "something like a tank a mini tank yeah", "40:01", "but I wonder like for getting over logs", "40:04", "and stuff like that if there's any sort", "40:05", "of benefit they also have those ones", "40:07", "that leap up in the air and they go over", "40:09", "there go over the top of walls and shit", "40:11", "yeah that's what you need is some kind", "40:12", "of a legs that can pop out if they need", "40:13", "to yeah maybe we should just design this", "40:16", "thing and take a look there you go", "40:17", "here's one wheels yeah see oh god that's", "40:20", "got the best of both yeah let's fucking", "40:22", "terrified that we've got front legs", "40:24", "let's go back wheels yeah they're not", "40:27", "fucking playing games didn't Google buy", "40:28", "them in that Google Skynet that's what", "40:32", "we should be careful of yeah Google is", "40:35", "powerful", "40:36", "goddamn their big announcement they made", "40:38", "this week about the Google i/o assistant", "40:41", "AI stuff is pretty crazy too I don't", "40:43", "know but it did information so I can't", "40:45", "tell you just look it up if we're", "40:47", "getting scared this is like the Google", "40:48", "Siri type thing yeah yeah yeah exact", "40:51", "this is for the new pixel phone yep yep", "40:53", "what is oh it was lunch an extra", "40:55", "announcements on top of that - what's", "40:56", "supposed to be significant whoa do you", "40:58", "see that thing jump over a fucking look", "41:00", "at this yeah see that's the thing you", "41:02", "know out fuck that thing see without", "41:04", "even knowing it I was saying wheels legs", "41:07", "is burnt there you go but that thing", "41:09", "that rewind that a little bit well I", "41:11", "should go over the wall it jumps over a", "41:14", "wall look a little bit before that yeah", "41:16", "watch this watch with this fucking thing", "41:17", "can do man after it does this he goes", "41:20", "down these stairs and then it gets to", "41:22", "means it gets to this wall like a hurdle", "41:25", "and it fucking bounces over this hurdle", "41:27", "like it's nothing there's snow doesn't", "41:29", "matter grass doesn't matter yes doesn't", "41:33", "break one of those stupid wheels the", "41:35", "problem is one of those wheels may now", "41:36", "you shoot one of those wheels I think", "41:37", "fuck look at sowing bounces right over", "41:40", "that no problem tucks its legs it looks", "41:42", "terrifying yeah then put it cover it in", "41:45", "like some creepy fucking fake skin like", "41:47", "an alien you know yeah and then you'd", "41:49", "put sensors on it you know thermal", "41:52", "sensors and night vision sensors and you", "41:53", "wouldn't be able to get away from it", "41:55", "yeah you know wasn't you down and kill", "41:56", "you I mean just think about that", "41:57", "technology and then", "41:59", "had that Tesla technology for", "42:01", "self-driving cars and knows where all", "42:03", "the cars are and everything we're just", "42:05", "we're just a few years away from", "42:07", "something very very bizarre yeah I again", "42:10", "I kind of look forward to it bring on", "42:13", "the robots all the fight them I'll go", "42:15", "down to blaze of glory yeah that's like", "42:18", "at the now Nukem sorry", "42:20", "ripping out battery cords and trying to", "42:21", "take their lives yeah Arnold", "42:23", "Schwarzenegger in Terminator it's funny", "42:25", "because when that Google assistant can", "42:27", "see and understand the world around you", "42:29", "why they built that like google google", "42:31", "lens thing that used to be existing and", "42:33", "they took it away", "42:33", "it kind of just built with a new blend", "42:35", "and then you get the you track", "42:37", "sunglasses you know you mean Google", "42:38", "glasses yeah I'm sorry my lens is that", "42:40", "thing that translates the world that", "42:41", "translates languages they just kind of", "42:44", "put all that data into this and so now", "42:45", "it's on that phone and everyone will", "42:48", "have it that has the new pixel in it so", "42:50", "what does it do it's doing a bunch as", "42:52", "far as I know right now it's a bunch of", "42:53", "AI information so it's looking at", "42:55", "barcodes and QR codes all over the place", "42:57", "and it's you don't even have to have a", "42:59", "really excuse me a good version of it", "43:02", "you can do it from far away and it can", "43:04", "read it it can be really low pixelated", "43:07", "not saying about where I'm losing the", "43:08", "word resolution yeah yeah low resolution", "43:11", "you can use resolution it can pick it up", "43:13", "from far away to off the TV so that's", "43:15", "cool isn't it like shown again what does", "43:17", "bark why why do you need to read", "43:18", "barcodes each other tell me well I know", "43:21", "one thing it's the new pixels supposed", "43:23", "to do like say if you have like this", "43:24", "stevia and you I want to get this you", "43:26", "know it's got a little barcode you put", "43:28", "your phone up to it'll show you a link", "43:29", "on Amazon you can one click it just like", "43:31", "that so that's one good thing that it", "43:34", "does for the barcodes but you know it", "43:35", "can compare prices and stores it's", "43:37", "saying automatically whether it's using", "43:38", "Amazon and they'll block that my PC so", "43:41", "basically we're moving into the ultimate", "43:42", "age of consumerism yeah so buy this now", "43:45", "it's just a step up in instantaneous per", "43:47", "instantaneous purchasing but like as far", "43:50", "as like reading the world around you", "43:52", "what else is it doing uh I mean I think", "43:54", "you have to hold it up to see it so it's", "43:57", "right here it says you can aim it at a", "43:58", "flower and it'll and it will identify", "44:00", "the species whoa you can point pull up a", "44:02", "bands music or videos by pointing the", "44:04", "lens at a concert poster whoa so

name Joe", "44:13", "it gets underlined and if you click that", "44:15", "a whole bunch of information pops up and", "44:17", "leads to like all of your things on", "44:18", "Apple music it leads to your webpage", "44:21", "it's like a little serious iStent thing", "44:23", "but it hasn't been advertised and it's", "44:25", "not really it doesn't work for every", "44:27", "person's name like it might not work for", "44:28", "Jocko willing but it will work for Joe", "44:30", "Rogan and it might in the future if they", "44:32", "update it or I don't know who needs to", "44:34", "update that's kind of it's cool too this", "44:36", "is an updated version of that I believe", "44:39", "and just to bring this conversation back", "44:43", "to where we were the further we go in", "44:44", "this direction of technology being in", "44:48", "every part of our lives the further away", "44:50", "we get from having to struggle with", "44:52", "things and the bigger hole there's going", "44:56",

"45:05", "to go further and further into the past", "45:06", "and further then further down and people", "45:08", "can have that hole to fill up somehow", "45:09", "yeah the physical body needs it has", "45:12", "requirements that is stress requirements", "45:15", "and if you I always do the way I talk", "45:17", "about it's like a battery and like", "45:18", "almost like but not a conventional", "45:20", "battery the way we think of us but", "45:21", "almost like a storage vessel for energy", "45:23", "and then if you don't do anything with", "45:25", "that energy it's sort of oozes over the", "45:27", "side and fucking battery acid crust the", "45:29", "outside of it like it gets all fucked up", "45:32", "but if you just keep pumping out energy", "45:35", "you keep doing

fuck man", "47:13", "like when is this going to end I wonder", "47:15", "when they're going to be able to figure", "47:16", "out a way to compensate for all the shit", "47:20", "that like just some sort of a pill that", "47:23", "figures that or even crisper", "47:25", "I was I was listening to his radio lab", "47:26", "podcast where they're updating CRISPR", "47:28", "where do you know what CRISPR is it's a", "47:31", "new tool that they have that they're", "47:33", "using to modify genes and they they've", "47:38", "only figured it out over the last few", "47:39", "years and apparently they've already", "47:41", "started doing work on non-viable fetuses", "47:44", "in China with this that's what they say", "47:46", "who knows whether it went by time they", "47:48", "say that my thought is the guy telling", "47:50", "you is probably some fucking fake person", "47:52", "by then you know by the time it actually", "47:53", "gets to the news who knows what kind of", "47:56", "crazy advancements they're making you", "47:58", "know behind the iron curtain or there is", "48:00", "is there an Iron Curtain anymore well", "48:01", "there's China and there's definitely", "48:03", "some things going on in China though for", "48:04", "sure they're doing some dark shit yeah", "48:06", "with people in this goddamn technology", "48:08", "but they think that they're not only", "48:10", "going to be able to use this gene", "48:12", "editing tool but they're going to be", "48:15", "able to implant this gene editing tool", "48:17", "into our genetics so that your own genes", "48:20", "start doing the work of CRISPR for you", "48:23", "so things like they think that's going", "48:25", "to take the place of antibiotics they", "48:27", "think it's going to be able to edit out", "48:29", "things like Alzheimer's like whatever", "48:31", "the gene is for Alzheimer's they'll be", "48:32", "able to edit that out so Alzheimer's", "48:34", "will no longer exist it's going to be", "48:36", "really really strange because we're", "48:38", "going to have to make decisions", "48:40", "yeah and I think the stuff is gonna come", "48:41", "quickly once it like once we turn the", "48:43", "corner it seems like it's gonna come", "48:45", "fast oh it's gonna come real fast", "48:46", "there's going to be some weird mutations", "48:49", "that happen in there too", "48:50", "yeah there's gonna be people to look", "48:51", "like the Hulk yeah there's gonna be some", "48:53", "people that have one eye in in two heads", "48:55", "and just gonna be all jacked up and", "48:57", "they're gonna what do we knew those", "48:58", "people right the ones that didn't look", "49:00", "yet that it didn't work right", "49:01", "Tijuana is crisper job whistles crisper", "49:05", "uphill is it uh no it's some sort of a", "49:07", "gene editing tool I don't know the", "49:08", "actual mechanism behind it I don't", "49:10", "understand I've only like listened to", "49:12", "people talk about it and read things on", "49:13", "it and then how far away is immortality", "49:15", "from that because once you can eliminate", "49:17", "all these different diseases yeah I", "49:19", "think like a hundred years and I always", "49:21", "thought if you could just clone your", "49:22", "body and then you let your body grow to", "49:25", "be twenty years old then you just take", "49:27", "your brain out put it inside that new", "49:29", "body then you're good to go yes I think", "49:31", "it's going to be even creepier than that", "49:33", "I think they're gonna be able to turn", "49:34", "back the clock because I think that when", "49:36", "you think about like cellular aging well", "49:39", "what is it your body's not reproduce you", "49:40", "know every cell in your body except for", "49:43", "your neurons reproduces like somewhere", "49:46", "between every three to seven years or", "49:47", "something like that right your neurons", "49:49", "are the only things you keep for the", "49:51", "whole life and so what they're thinking", "49:53", "is that like as time goes on your your", "49:56", "cells reproduce shittier and shittier", "49:58", "your telomeres shrink okay doesn't do", "50:01", "what well they'll be able to flip that", "50:03", "around so that as time goes on you'll be", "50:05", "like Benjamin buttons you'll start", "50:07", "getting younger and younger which will", "50:08", "be really weird if they fuck it up and", "50:10", "you start turning into a baby you know", "50:12", "you're like some fifty year old then", "50:13", "also and you're like dude I'm 12 again", "50:15", "like this is not good next year I'm", "50:17", "going to be 11 ya know like if it goes", "50:19", "backwards in that direction if they can", "50:21", "literally halt it like if they can take", "50:24", "you and then like say if you're a 40", "50:26", "year old woman and they put you on a 20", "50:29", "year program and they're like well in 20", "50:31", "years instead of being 60 you're going", "50:32", "to be 20 and this is how it's going to", "50:34", "work next year you're going to be 39", "50:35", "next that's totally conceivable that's", "50:38", "totally conceivable totally a hundred", "50:41", "percent conceivable possible and likely", "50:44", "yeah yeah then then that immortality", "50:47", "thing isn't that far away then the only", "50:49", "thing that's going to fuck you up as", "50:50", "accidents and murder and you know", "50:52", "like that asteroids is life become more", "50:55", "precious than because now you're", "50:56", "thinking hey I don't want to go", "50:57", "skydiving because I could actually live", "50:59", "for thousands of years if I don't screw", "51:01", "this up I think more likely you're gonna", "51:03", "see a lot more parkour and those", "51:05", "assholes that are doing backflips off", "51:07", "the Grand Canyon like that kind of shit", "51:09", "you're gonna see you can see more more", "51:11", "more people that are like wanting to", "51:13", "feel alive by taking crazy risks yeah", "51:17", "those Russian dudes though ah well I had", "51:19", "James Kingston on the podcast he's that", "51:22", "crazy asshole from England yeah great", "51:23", "kid but he's does backflips on top of", "51:26", "fucking buildings in Dubai and shit like", "51:28", "what are you doing man yeah you posted", "51:31", "one of those the other day he said", "51:32", "something like you know I don't know how", "51:34", "you wrote it but you said something like", "51:36", "and I

resonates", "53:02", "about hanging from something by your", "53:04", "hand", "53:05", "like that's one of the scariest ones", "53:07", "like Kingston is on this gigantic crane", "53:09", "and he's hanging on to the crane with", "53:12", "his hands and then he does it with one", "53:13", "hand he's hanging there and he's fucking", "53:15", "hundreds of feet up and if he falls he's", "53:17", "just splatter he's just the water", "53:19", "balloon oh but there's something about", "53:22", "for some reason like balancing scary but", "53:25", "hanging is really scary I'm the opposite", "53:28", "really balance is scarier than hanging", "53:31", "I'd rather hang pretty good hang we got", "53:34", "a good grip yeah I don't do a lot of", "53:35", "tennis I don't feel good about the the", "53:37", "balancing cuz I think you know I could", "53:39", "trip and fall that's it what's the life", "53:41", "expectancy of Kingston not so good I", "53:44", "mean he knows that right yeah

not a big deal because he knows", "56:19", "how strong he is and he knows what his", "56:22", "limitations are so it doesn't hurt it's", "56:24", "like he's comfortable with it right he's", "56:27", "comfortable like you know someone", "56:28", "walking on a balance beam that does it", "56:30", "all the time they're gonna be", "56:30", "comfortable with it and he's climbing", "56:32", "stuff all the time so he's more complex", "56:33", "still hard to get a grip on though it's", "56:35", "hard to get a grip you know when I was", "56:36", "hosting Fear Factor we had this one", "56:38", "thing that we did where we people had", "56:41", "people hang from a pole that was", "56:43", "suspended over this water and it was", "56:46", "shocking how like the least the little", "56:51", "amount of time the small amount of time", "56:52", "that men in particular could hang from a", "56:55", "pole like they were like a minute in", "56:57", "these guys were dropping into the water", "56:59", "and I was like what the fuck like women", "57:01", "want it really yeah women want it", "57:03", "because they have they have lighter", "57:05", "bodies so even though their hands might", "57:07", "be weaker like and one guy was fucking", "57:10", "jack there's like this football player", "57:11", "looking do it and he didn't make it man", "57:13", "he was like a minute and 15 in plop it", "57:15", "into the water I was like this is crazy", "57:16", "yeah I had I had a guy in my my SEAL", "57:19", "training class of was a big giant", "57:21", "monster guy and he couldn't complete the", "57:23", "obstacle course no you know two people", "57:25", "in strength it's too much too much mass", "57:28", "behind you that you're asking", "57:30", "small limbs or small digits to control", "57:32", "and then also too much of your heart is", "57:35", "got to pump too much blood through that", "57:37", "tissue there's like a point of", "57:39", "diminishing returns when it comes to", "57:40", "size yeah you know and that that's one", "57:42", "of the things you saw when you see Cain", "57:44", "Velasquez fight guys", "57:46", "Cain Velasquez has always been in that", "57:48", "sweet spot of about 240 240 to me is", "57:51", "about as big as you want to get because", "57:53", "the guys over 240 men they might fuck", "57:55", "you up in the first few minutes but you", "57:57", "take him into that fourth and fifth", "57:58", "minute of the first round and they're", "58:00", "huffing and puffing then the second", "58:01", "round they're getting their asses kicked", "58:02", "and the Cain Velasquez storm was that", "58:06", "one of the more fascinating things to", "58:07", "watch in all my years of the UFC because", "58:09", "he was a heavyweight that had the cardio", "58:12", "of a lightweight now but he was again", "58:14", "240 pounds a well-marbled well-marbled", "58:18", "240 dollars not like he was a lean no he", "58:21", "had some he always looks a little bit", "58:23", "need a lot of executes away yeah there's", "58:25", "some rice and beans on is he can eat", "58:27", "lunch with like for real like you like", "58:29", "one of the elite heavyweights ever yeah", "58:31", "and he's sitting there with fucking 10", "58:32", "tacos and shit and you know that's a", "58:34", "talent too but the having that kind of", "58:36", "sustained energy is a talent just like", "58:39", "some guys are super flexible and some", "58:41", "guys are super strong and explosive and", "58:43", "some guys just have that they could they", "58:45", "have that range and what is its medium", "58:47", "twitch muscles right it's medium twitch", "58:49", "flow to it yeah well know that it's not", "58:51", "theirs slow twitch which is I'm a", "58:52", "marathoner right and then there's fast", "58:54", "twitch which is Amin Olympic", "58:56", "weightlifter but in recent years they've", "58:58", "said there's actually something in the", "58:59", "middle twitch which is I'm strong but I", "59:01", "can go for a long time that's", "59:03", "interesting I didn't know about that but", "59:04", "it makes sense and that's what a guy", "59:06", "like Cain is cuz Cain like you said I", "59:08", "mean for him to be able to get in there", "59:09", "and go five rounds pushing away pushing", "59:11", "around another guy that weighs 260", "59:12", "pounds yeah that's beast mode right", "59:14", "there there's a lot going on with Cain I", "59:16", "think one thing is going on is genetics", "59:18", "he has incredible genetics and they", "59:20", "they're like Bob cook would tell me that", "59:22", "Cain would be out for months", "59:24", "like get an injury and come back it's at", "59:25", "work everybody I could just have insane", "59:27", "cardio so maybe it's also

something", "89:54", "on your hands your hands need to be able", "89:56", "to articulate move to secure certain", "89:58", "grips and you get it's you'd see a lot", "90:01", "more submissions I think

your book extreme", "98:31", "ownership and it's one thing that I", "98:33", "think a you and I are both really", "98:36", "focused on is the way the brain works", "98:38", "and the way the mind works

"99:40", "there's some other method that's maybe", "99:43", "more productive or more successful", "99:45", "well there's the downfall I mean and", "99:47", "that's that you know again I think this", "99:49", "is one of the reasons why your show is", "99:51", "so popular and why people listen to you", "99:55", "because you you listen to other people", "99:57", "right people listen to you because

and he's talking", "101:26", "about the fact that sometimes people if", "101:29", "they if they accept those new ideas all", "101:32", "of a sudden what they've done with their", "101:33", "life for the past twenty years gets", "101:34", "thrown out the window", "101:35", "yeah and that's got to be really hard", "101:37", "and immediately when I was listening to", "101:38", "that I was thinking to myself yeah", "101:40", "that's that's what happened in the 90s", "101:41", "when somebody that had been studying", "101:43", "some traditional martial art god bless", "101:45", "them they were doing the best they could", "101:47", "but when all of a sudden some blue belt", "101:49", "in jujitsu could come in there and roll", "101:50", "him up and choke him out and there was", "101:51", "nothing they could do about it", "101:52", "and they either had to do one of two", "101:54", "things say okay I'm gonna start training", "101:57", "this other new thing that I understand", "101:59", "or block it out which was very hard to", "102:02", "do with jujitsu I mean that's the good", "102:03", "thing about MMA and about UFC is it was", "102:06", "like uh you can deny it all you want but", "102:08", "you have to face this guy on the mat", "102:09", "that's the only way you can and when you", "102:11", "do that you're gonna lose whereas with", "102:13", "all these kind of intellectual arguments", "102:15", "a lot of times it's just I say you say I", "102:18", "say you say and if you tell me you know", "102:21", "if I'm telling you that every picture of", "102:22", "the earth is

"102:53", "kicks and when I went from that to", "102:55", "kickboxing I realized how easy it was to", "102:58", "get punched in the face and I was like", "103:00", "wow and so then I started really", "103:02", "studying boxing and I was like man my my", "103:04", "ideas of like how well I can fight are", "103:07", "so overestimated I'm not nearly as if", "103:10", "I'm a good at Taekwondo I'm not good at", "103:12", "fighting and then I started doing my", "103:14", "time I'm like oh well fucking leg kicks", "103:16", "Jesus Christ leg kicks and knees to the", "103:19", "body and the coin shows like oh fuck", "103:22", "there's so much I can I'm so fucked now", "103:24", "because I got I got really", "103:26", "good at something that kind of sucks on", "103:28", "its own yeah and then from there", "103:30", "jiu-jitsu", "103:31", "where I was just getting raped I was", "103:33", "like at least with kickboxing I could", "103:36", "throw kicks I could move around I could", "103:38", "try not to get my legs kicked I could", "103:40", "try to like to be more mobile but when I", "103:43", "was going into jujitsu as a white belt I", "103:45", "was just getting fucking malls what",

"103:54", "can't even start like white but some of", "103:58", "us never change it's before is it has a", "104:00", "zero percent chance of beating a guy", "104:03", "that's a black belt yes zero like

something like that where you're", "104:37", "almost a hundred percent dead", "104:39", "yeah it's but I think that there's", "104:41", "parallels to that in life because if you", "104:43", "look at

"we have food and shelter how many people", "113:58", "would then pursue their actual love and", "114:01", "what they're actually passionate about", "114:03", "and would it be to say there's there's", "114:05", "tests they're doing they're doing on it", "114:06", "now they're trying to find out would the", "114:08", "same amount of people be successful", "114:10", "would more be successful or would less", "114:12", "like how many people would pursue their", "114:14", "dream if they knew they didn't have to", "114:15", "worry about starving to death", "114:17", "they just got money every month they got", "114:18", "they knew where they were going to sleep", "114:20", "and eat and then they could just go and", "114:21", "do whatever the fuck they want to do or", "114:23", "would that just squash motivation I", "114:26", "don't know I don't know what the answer", "114:29", "is yeah I'd say what I think I think it", "114:30", "I think it squashes motivation for some", "114:32", "Hank you", "114:33", "with it for you if you got a check every", "114:35", "month for like 12 grand or 12 grand for", "114:38", "the year whatever it is like I think", "114:39", "that's the idea", "114:40", "so you give people like a thousand bucks", "114:41", "a year or a thousand bucks a month", "114:42", "thousand bucks a month yeah", "114:44", "maybe double that just enough that you", "114:46", "could just get by but you know you're", "114:48", "not boiling to questions number one of", "114:50", "course would I take free money", "114:52", "sure would I feel good about it No",

time you", "115:00", "every time the government gives a dollar", "115:03", "to somebody they took that dollar from", "115:06", "somebody else yeah oh and it's you know", "115:09", "it's that's the reality of it yeah then", "115:12", "the question is like where it like when", "115:14", "a guy like Bernie Madoff or some crazy", "115:16", "Wall Street character when they just", "115:18", "move some money around and make money", "115:20", "like okay how much you getting out of", "115:22", "that yeah where's that coming from", "115:24", "who's whose money was that like where's", "115:27", "that go where's that going and has it", "115:29", "how does it exist", "115:30", "well Bernie's a bad example right", "115:32", "because he was stealing everyone's or", "115:33", "the best example well okay yeah I'll", "115:35", "give you that yeah yeah but again those", "115:39", "people are formulating companies and", "115:42", "funding companies that are trying to", "115:44", "grow and build and create things you", "115:47", "know that that money it moves somewhere", "115:49", "and it ends up you know investing in a", "115:51", "company and building a company that's", "115:52", "what that's what that's what America is", "115:54", "right now trying to build things trying", "115:56", "to make things yeah taking risk I wonder", "115:59", "what is going to happen though when all", "116:01", "these fucking robots well I think John", "116:03", "is the automatic driving cars trucks", "116:06", "because that's a huge you know you go to", "116:08", "Vegas I always think about this
