there", "04:50", "you're getting the briefings from the", "04:51", "heads of the agencies which happened and", "04:53", "then if you notice after that briefing", "04:56", "his his tone changed

to the", "05:09", "agency and again he has a meeting which", "05:11", "I think was a great thing I was really", "05:12", "happy to see that he did that and and so", "05:14", "soon in the administration goes out to", "05:16", "to our headquarters out there in", "05:18", "Virginia and you know he got sidetracked", "05:22", "but that's his personality he starts", "05:24", "talking about

right so he's can I get", "05:40", "sidetracked he's got to talk about other", "05:41", "things and then that becomes the story", "05:43", "yeah that's it that's I guess where I'm", "05:44", "said a balanced perspective how did it", "05:46", "happen because this is what was", "05:48", "confusing to me how did the FBI and now", "05:50", "original eventually the FBI came around", "05:53", "to the

"yeah the big I think the big", "06:03", "disagreement was really over motivation", "06:05", "right I mean what it was it big part it", "06:08", "was an evidence based thing that they", "06:09", "didn't see any evidence that the", "06:10", "Russians were involved which actually", "06:12", "became clear now there was a rest there", "06:14", "was an arrest an unprecedented us a", "06:16", "couple of days ago right yeah well I", "06:18", "think but you're also talking about two", "06:19", "different coops so the bureau is the FBI", "06:21", "as a law enforcement so when they look", "06:24", "at something they're looking at it from", "06:25", "a law enforcement perspective they're", "06:26", "looking at gathering sufficient evidence", "06:28", "to prove a case basically that's how", "06:30", "they look at the agency is an Intel", "06:32", "operation and so they're get Gavin", "06:34", "pieces of information you know it's not", "06:35", "an evidentiary chain thing right so", "06:37", "let's just get you know the", "06:38", "preponderance of Intel let's see where", "06:40", "Italy", "06:40", "some of its going to be conflicting some", "06:42", "of its not well well-sourced but let's", "06:44", "all see what it tells us you know and so", "06:46", "part of it is how they approach reaching", "06:50", "a conclusion but you know they were both", "06:53", "going to get to the same place because", "06:55", "the eventually they sit down and they", "06:57", "compare notes but part of it was the", "07:00", "difference of opinion over the", "07:02", "motivation and motivations the toughest", "07:03", "thing one of the toughest things to", "07:04", "prove in in this business and", "07:07", "intelligence you know you can say okay", "07:09", "they did this but you know unless you've", "07:10", "got a source sitting in the tent", "07:12", "who was there and part of the", "07:13", "conversation when somebody says well you", "07:15", "know this is why or if you know this is", "07:17", "how we're going to do this and this is a", "07:18", "reason without that sort of sourcing or", "07:20", "you know intercepts it's it's tough to", "07:23", "prove motivation so it took a while to", "07:25", "kind of get around to that notion and", "07:27", "it's still to be honest you know it's", "07:30", "still a little bit up in the air we're", "07:31", "probably never going to get unless again", "07:32", "we get our hands on a really quality", "07:34", "good source that may still be a little", "07:36", "bit up in the air but the bottom line is", "07:38", "Russian together Russians were engaged", "07:39", "in doing what they always do over to", "07:41", "action propaganda campaigns whatever it", "07:44", "may be there's did the 30,000 foot view", "07:46", "was always the same they wanted they", "07:48", "want to so a sense of mistrust they want", "07:52", "to create some chaos they want to you", "07:54", "know kind of chip away at the belief", "07:55", "that you know a democracy is a great", "07:56", "thing and they did I look how much time", "07:59", "was spent talking about the integrity of", "08:01", "the election system and whether we", "08:02", "actually had a legitimate president or", "08:03", "not that's a win so you got a couple of", "08:05", "Colonels in the FSB which was the old", "08:07", "KGB who undoubtedly been promoted as a", "08:10", "result of that operation and who got", "08:12", "someone got arrested from the FSB who", "08:15", "was that guy yeah I know yeah I don't", "08:17", "have those details in front of me I just", "08:18", "don't you can got a pissed-off Putin", "08:20", "yeah exactly I perform in the fucking", "08:23", "hole for why he just said the wrong", "08:25", "thing you know but unprecedented right", "08:28", "then they never matically arrest their", "08:31", "guys but now what they did they have for", "08:34", "certain things for corruption issues if", "08:37", "they get sideways you know from internal", "08:39", "arguments you know then you'll you'll", "08:41", "yeah it usually doesn't make the news", "08:42", "because nobody really gives a shit", "08:43", "outside of Russia and they do now", "08:45", "because of this because of men because", "08:47", "if people want to talk about it and what", "08:48", "bothered me about this starting", "08:50", "irreparable what bothered me about this", "08:51", "was the narrative because the narrative", "08:53", "was Russia", "08:54", "the elections that's what every kept", "08:55", "saying and then with all these Democrats", "08:57", "these left-wing people were saying to", "08:59", "try to pump up this idea that Trump was", "09:01", "not a legitimate president Russia hacked", "09:03", "the election Russia hacked election well", "09:05", "know someone maybe Russia whoever it was", "09:08", "put that information out that the DNC", "09:12", "had sent through private emails but the", "09:14", "information was what they sent I mean it",

better candidate oh well you know", "09:55", "you always like the person sitting on", "09:56", "the bench and then they get in the race", "09:57", "and they're not you know that's true too", "09:59", "right they want to dug up some shit", "10:00", "about those guys but Bernie was an", "10:02", "interesting guy and there was not a", "10:04", "whole lot of people that are in his", "10:05", "position for as long as he is that have", "10:07", "the kind of principles he has like when", "10:09", "he was able to say you know why don't", "10:10", "you release the transcripts of all these", "10:12",

organization with with a", "11:09", "chip on their shoulder logging so", "11:11", "especially after what she did for you I", "11:13", "mean they rigged the primaries they", "11:16", "really did and people should be upset", "11:18", "about that way more than anything else", "11:19", "this idea that Russia did something when", "11:22", "you expose something that you should", "11:23", "that we should have known we should have", "11:25", "known about it because it's a crime you", "11:27", "know that kind of corruption is", "11:28", "essentially collusion it's a crime it's", "11:30", "a
