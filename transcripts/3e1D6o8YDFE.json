I've never seen this he", "04:06", "said but what I think is happening is I", "04:08", "think it's a female and I trying to fuck", "04:10", "you", "04:11", "well I said it's not mating season it", "04:15", "expires fine again what I think happen", "04:17", "you for later", "04:21", "okay I've seen him for four months in", "04:23", "this water I'm gonna fuck it", "04:25", "mating season is probably right around", "04:27", "the corner she's like if he sticks", "04:28", "around I know I was like that was a", "04:35", "concern of mine but no Matt said no no I", "04:40", "think it's a female I think that she", "04:42", "thinks that you're an injured seal and", "04:44", "so for the next five miles", "04:46", "she basically guided me all the way to", "04:48", "the shallower water and as I got there", "04:51", "it was literally the depth for the water", "04:53", "Matt said yeah yeah much shallower water", "04:55", "and we turned whale breached one more", "04:57", "time and then and then swam off as if to", "04:59", "say you know you're safe now", "05:00", "Wow why is there so much pushback", "05:03", "against it well so the thing is I think", "05:05", "what's going on and so people worry that", "05:07", "it doesn't look like a problem to be", "05:08", "solved anymore so when you want our kids", "05:11", "we both have lots of gay friends but we", "05:13", "didn't know it because they're not", "05:14", "telling anybody because someone's gonna", "05:15", "kick their ass if they knew that they", "05:17", "were gay now yes gay people are still", "05:19", "discriminated against but it's so much", "05:20", "better than it was then what you don't", "05:22", "want to what I think people are", "05:23", "advocates don't want to say is well", "05:24", "there's no problem anymore because then", "05:26", "you can allow them to still run into", "05:29", "troubles in various circumstances even", "05:30", "though the trouble they run into today", "05:31", "is a thousand times less than the", "05:33", "trouble they ran to and very little same", "05:35", "thing holds for racism same thing holds", "05:37", "for sexes and they've all gotten so much", "05:39", "better but and sexual violence is a", "05:42", "perfect example you know if you look at", "05:43", "if you said this is in Pinker's book if", "05:45", "you said rape and homicide - you call it", "05:48", "both of them whatever level they are in", "05:50", "1970 - a hundred and then you track them", "05:52", "through to the early 2000s homicide is", "05:55", "in the u.s. homicides dropped down to", "05:57", "like 50 rapes dropped down to like 25", "05:59", "but if you listen to women's advocacy", "06:01", "groups about campus sexual assault and", "06:03", "stuff you'd never know that and the", "06:05", "reason you wouldn't know it is because", "06:06", "they people worry well if you think the", "06:09", "problems getting better on its own then", "06:10", "you won't keep doing anything to help", "06:12", "fix it and that's a really unfortunate", "06:14", "part of our psychology because it makes", "06:16", "people feel like there's been no", "06:17", "progress and when you feel like there's", "06:19", "no progress then you think well maybe we", "06:20", "need to completely overturn the whole", "06:21", "system and try something new and that's", "06:23", "of course the point of Pinker's newest", "06:25", "book enlightenment now know things are", "06:27", "going freaking great turn it anarchy and", "06:29", "all those things are really bad ideas", "06:30", "voting for somebody like Trump's a", "06:32", "really bad idea because things are", "06:33", "actually running along", "06:34", "really nicely it's just that we tend to", "06:36", "forget it because every advocacy group", "06:38", "who's all worried about whatever their", "06:40", "particular issue is doesn't want the", "06:42", "word to get out that things are a lot", "06:43", "better than they used to be because I", "06:44", "think it's some fundamental level they", "06:46", "think well twenty five rapes here isn't", "06:48", "bad enough we better say that there's a", "06:49", "hundred you know I'm not saying they do", "06:50", "this consciously but of course twenty", "06:52", "five rapes here whatever the number is", "06:54", "is bad enough right it doesn't it", "06:56", "doesn't have to be the numbers that it", "06:58", "used to be when I was a child to be a", "06:59", "problem it all has to be is a number", "07:01", "above zero for my whole apprenticeship", "07:04", "alcohol was a reward you know you did a", "07:07", "good job tonight drink you know and then", "07:11", "it went from reward dude oh shit there", "07:15", "was like a bloodbath in the restaurant", "07:17", "you know we had to pick up this guy at", "07:19", "the hospital okay it's not a reward", "07:21", "let's forget about it let's drink you", "07:23", "know yeah and it was it was always there", "07:26", "you know that's great service let's have", "07:29", "a drink no you're in the food industry", "07:31", "but you're also in the wine industry", "07:32", "because fifty percent of what you're", "07:34", "doing is selling food to people and the", "07:35", "other fifty percent of what you're doing", "07:36", "is selling alcohol to people so by", "07:38", "default you're part of the people that", "07:40", "sell a liquid drug dealer in that you're", "07:45", "in that world every day you go to wine", "07:47", "tastings you talk with peoples that sell", "07:49", "alcohol that bartenders you talk to", "07:50", "people that sell wine you're partaken", "07:53", "eating and other your colleagues", "07:54", "restaurants and drinking wine X thing", "07:56", "you know you have a little bit of", "07:57", "celebrity you've been open for 15 years", "07:59", "and you look back and you go the seven", "08:03", "days in a week seven days in a week and", "08:06", "I drank six of them I don't feel good on", "08:11", "Sunday I'm just kind of recovering and", "08:13", "then what happens is one week turns into", "08:16", "two to four and then you kind of look", "08:18", "back and you realize in 2017 that you", "08:22", "may have drank forty eight weeks out of", "08:27", "52 you know and then it goes quick then", "08:32", "it's ten years your pen your restaurant", "08:35", "and you've been drinking five days out", "08:39", "of the week for ten years and then all", "08:41", "of a sudden you kind of have a problem", "08:42", "you realize that like my day-to-day is", "08:45", "based on food and wine", "08:47", "right now I don't want my it's not", "08:50", "making me happy", "08:51", "I've had all the wines I've had all the", "08:52", "foods am I better for it not really what", "08:57", "am I better for

see them now", "09:08", "I've even seen them switch teams and you", "09:10", "see them switch teams and I don't buy", "09:12", "their rationalizations when it comes to", "09:14", "ideology but I think is what they're", "09:15", "doing is they're switching teams because", "09:17", "they realize there's an in on this team", "09:19", "right and they can just say this is the", "09:21", "problem with the team I used to be on", "09:22", "those fucking losers and they're really", "09:24", "Benedict Arnold right and like they", "09:27", "probably have as much of an affinity to", "09:30", "the ideas of one side as it do the other", "09:32", "side they just go all in on one side to", "09:34", "get acceptance from the group right you", "09:36", "just no way people change their opinion", "09:38", "that much over two years or something", "09:40", "like that or you know it's like they", "09:41", "just decide this group makes more sense", "09:43", "now and I've been attacked by people on", "09:45", "the left so I'm gonna go to the right or", "09:46", "vice versa and usually what it is is", "09:49", "meaning when even when they say they've", "09:50", "been attacked like oh you fucking baby", "09:52", "there's 300 million people just in this", "09:55", "country alone if you put something out", "09:57", "there publicly and a thousand people", "09:59", "attack you don't act like

whether it's people", "10:09", "on the right or people on the left you", "10:11", "got to be able to argue your point one", "10:13", "way or the other and not just", "10:14", "immediately jump ship on someone who", "10:16", "shares ideas with you decides that your", "10:19", "idea sucks and maybe they're wrong and", "10:21", "maybe you're right", "10:22", "but you got to argue that through but", "10:24", "this idea of these partisan patterns", "10:27", "that people just seem to automatically", "10:30", "fall into they're so detrimental to", "10:32", "dialog they're so detrimental to us",
