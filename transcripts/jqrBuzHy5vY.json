nowhere and the only", "88:57", "way you find out is if you take a chance", "88:59", "doing it", "89:00", "yeah that's why i think it's unfair and", "89:02", "i was having a discussion with two", "89:06", "great big comedians about the louis set", "89:10", "that he did like recently yeah and i i", "89:12", "think he already talked about this", "89:14", "but uh the guy was testing stuff", "89:17", "yeah so how can you judge if the work is", "89:20", "not done", "89:21", "it's not even close to done he probably", "89:22", "maybe he did that bit once", "89:24", "before if that you know and the judgment", "89:26", "was like oh he has to address what", "89:28", "happened with him", "89:30", "i'm pretty sure he will but not on that", "89:32", "set maybe he didn't dress on that set", "89:33", "that not he's special", "89:35", "right when he has his special that's", "89:37", "when he framed the thing", "89:39", "okay that's my work yeah but if he's", "89:42", "just testing stuff you cannot judge by", "89:44", "that", "89:44", "the problem is now everybody wants to", "89:46", "judge everything he does", "89:47", "they want to find him and watch him and", "89:49", "so now he has to institute this uh cell", "89:52", "phone policy at all the comedy clubs he", "89:54", "works at where you have to take your", "89:55", "phone and put it in a bag", "89:56", "so that no one can get a hold of it it's", "89:58", "just it's a real problem", "90:00", "he's got a real problem and it's also a", "90:02", "real problem for creating comedy", "90:04", "because if people don't understand that", "90:06", "this this is what comedy is about the", "90:08", "comedy is about", "90:09", "improvisation and then boiling it down", "90:12", "to what's good and then figuring out", "90:14", "what's the best way to express an idea", "90:17", "because sometimes you have an idea and", "90:18", "you know there's something there but you", "90:20", "don't know how to say it so you just", "90:21", "take a chance on one way and then you go", "90:23", "oh that's offensive that's disgusting", "90:25", "but there's got to be a way to do it let", "90:27", "me find a better way yeah", "90:28", "of course yeah there's many bits that i", "90:30", "did um like uh", "90:32", "not my last special but especially", "90:34", "before where when i first started them", "90:36", "they were not doing well at all", "90:38", "they were not doing well at all i had to", "90:39", "figure out a way to make them funny", "90:41", "why did you insist on them because i", "90:43", "knew there was something there", "90:44", "and there was something there like like", "90:47", "for instance i have this", "90:48", "one bit on women uh in inventions", "90:51", "and that women don't invent a lot of", "90:53", "things and i it took a long time for me", "90:56", "to figure out how to do that and the", "90:58", "best way to do that was to talk about", "91:00", "all the great things about women first", "91:02", "so i just had", "91:03", "i had to talk about you know like the", "91:06", "the concept that", "91:07", "women are supposed to work that we", "91:09", "should that women are supposed to work", "91:10", "as well as raise children which is", "91:12", "fucking crazy because", "91:13", "raising children i'm not not saying that", "91:15", "every woman should raise children", "91:17",

"difficult things in the world", "91:24", "they're just to have the patience you're", "91:26", "dealing with these little people you", "91:27", "have to teach them things you have to re", "91:29", "you have to give them love and constant", "91:30", "attention and it's very very time", "91:32", "consuming it's difficult", "91:34", "and these women are making people in", "91:37", "their fucking bodies it's the most", "91:38", "incredible thing that anyone has ever", "91:39", "created", "91:40", "humans you make you make humans in your", "91:43", "body i mean that's insane", "91:45", "and i would go through this whole thing", "91:46", "and then i'd say so", "91:48", "ladies i love you i think you're amazing", "91:50", "but let's be honest", "91:51", "you don't invent a lot of shit and then", "91:54", "i got into this whole thing about women", "91:55", "inventions", "91:56", "and then i just talked about all the", "91:58", "great inventions that women make", "92:00", "okay you set up differently yeah it's", "92:02", "the same thing when i figure out how to", "92:03", "do it", "92:04", "it took a while to figure out how to do", "92:06", "it where the women thought it was funny",
