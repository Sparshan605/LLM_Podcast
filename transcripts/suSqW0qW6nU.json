subscription podcast", "145:08", "yeah and he what he was saying is it's", "145:10", "really difficult to grow", "145:12", "like you have to keep those people that", "145:14", "you have you got to keep them happy and", "145:16", "they would do things to engage with them", "145:17", "and they would do like little events", "145:18", "where they'd go to a bar", "145:20", "and meet everybody and do a show from", "145:22", "there he said but it's really hard to", "145:24", "grow because people don't want to pay", "145:25", "when there's all these different shows", "145:27", "they could just get for free yeah that's", "145:29", "uh", "145:29", "that's always a challenge but there's", "145:31", "also", "145:33", "the commodity that people can't get", "145:35", "anywhere else is entertaining", "145:37", "shows like you could have a free show", "145:40", "that", "145:40", "sucks and there's plenty of those out", "145:43", "there", "145:44", "uh but if you're good at what you do and", "145:47", "and you already have an audience because", "145:49", "i", "145:49", "i say it all the time corolla had the", "145:51", "greatest line once", "145:52", "he was being interviewed and someone", "145:54", "said uh how do you", "145:56", "how do you make a successful podcast he", "145:58", "goes oh okay rule number one", "146:00", "be famous and it's like yeah you gotta", "146:04", "so i i figured if we get up and running", "146:06", "in a month", "146:07", "and keith uh uh figured it out that we", "146:09", "could hold on to a lot of", "146:11", "the ona audience that uh would come over", "146:14", "and", "146:14", "subscribe get it quick get up yeah and", "146:17", "that's why thank god i had that studio", "146:19", "already built in my basement", "146:20", "yeah i was able to all we needed was the", "146:22", "logistics of pumping it out onto the", "146:24", "internet in a bigger number than i was", "146:26", "doing", "146:26", "at three in the morning you were doing", "146:28", "some of them outside too", "146:30", "yeah yeah we'd set up the camera out by", "146:31", "the pool like my first guest was dice", "146:34", "which was hilarious yeah yeah dice uh", "146:36", "came by we sat by the pool", "146:38", "uh and then later on he went downstairs", "146:41", "uh", "146:42", "in my basement that karaoke stage and he", "146:44", "was singing elvis karaoke songs it was", "146:46", "hilarious and that's one of those", "146:48", "moments where you're like dice is in my", "146:50", "basement singing elvis", "146:51", "what the fuck did that happen you know", "146:53", "it was fucking awesome", "146:55", "yeah uh but yeah so so that model", "146:58", "uh works for us and it's been working", "147:01", "but i'm", "147:02", "i'm kind of seeing uh you got to keep on", "147:05", "your toes", "147:05", "in especially a technology-based", "147:07", "business we were just talking about", "147:08", "satellite radio like", "147:09", "you don't you just can't tell what's", "147:10", "going to happen you really got to kind", "147:12", "of look for future trends and whatnot", "147:14", "and uh maybe more of a hybrid thing", "147:17", "because it's a balancing act of bringing", "147:19", "new people", "147:20", "in and like you said keeping the people", "147:22", "that are there already", "147:23", "but bringing new people in with some", "147:25", "free content so maybe a tiered", "147:27", "subscription thing where there is a free", "147:29", "level with sponsors", "147:31", "uh but then a tiered uh premium level", "147:34", "with the material that we've already had", "147:38", "maybe uh uh past shows or something or", "147:40", "extra content", "147:41", "but so we're always trying to think of", "147:44", "what might be", "147:45", "a good option when i first fired this", "147:48", "thing up", "147:49", "we had no fucking clue i mean this was", "147:52", "usually you would kind of do some kind", "147:54", "of a research testing or whatever", "147:56", "marketing", "147:57", "analysis of day parts and shit like that", "148:00", "and i just", "148:01", "i was like i could i could be here by 4", "148:03", "pm", "148:05", "uh how long is the show gonna be six", "148:08", "two hours four to six i could i could go", "148:10", "out at six and", "148:12", "then i don't have to be there until 4pm", "148:14", "it's fucking easy", "148:15", "still lets me party uh monday through", "148:17", "friday", "148:18", "fuck that i want a three-day weekend all", "148:20", "the time for the rest of my life", "148:23", "so that's what we do monday through", "148:24", "thursday uh and then we have programming", "148:26", "on friday in the slot that um", "148:28", "i'm supposed to be in uh during the week", "148:31", "so uh it just i wanted i didn't want to", "148:35", "fucking be driving myself like that yeah", "148:37", "uh forever", "148:39", "so cut back on the hours the days and", "148:42", "it it worked so you know i'm very happy", "148:45", "with that but again you know we're", "148:46", "always assessing and seeing what we", "148:48", "could do to", "148:48", "kind of build it because it is that", "148:50", "trade-off of audience like obviously", "148:52", "we're not going to get as many people", "148:53", "watching", "148:54", "on a subscriber base than we would if it", "148:56", "was free", "148:57", "with spots but you know do you want to", "149:00", "cut down on", "149:01", "the paid subscribers and boost it up and", "149:04", "then how far do i", "149:05", "i go with advertisers where somebody can", "149:07", "call them and fuck me over now", "149:10", "and do i truly have free speech now or", "149:12", "as free as i", "149:13", "can be with a subscriber base so uh it's", "149:16", "a balancing act", "149:18", "i see what you're saying like you don't", "149:19", "want to totally abandon the subscriber", "149:21", "model because then you're at the mercy", "149:22", "of subscribe of uh advertising of", "149:24", "advertisers and it gets", "149:26", "like we have advertisers now we have a", "149:28", "couple of them uh that we pop maybe two", "149:30", "spots on a show", "149:31", "uh and i i do they're all live reads so", "149:34", "i i", "149:35", "make them fun and funny and you know", "149:37", "people like i learned that from howard", "149:39", "years ago when howard would go to spots", "149:41", "before he was syndicated too when he had", "149:43", "all the time in the world uh sometimes", "149:45", "he didn't even know he was still in a", "149:47", "commercial break", "149:47", "it was just funny so i try to keep it", "149:50", "light and fun and add in things uh", "149:53", "so it doesn't feel so intrusive uh but i", "149:56", "don't live and die by sponsors it's not", "149:58", "it's kind of supplements", "149:59", "uh the subscribers stuff so uh", "150:03", "that works and and i don't know", "150:06", "maybe i i'm paranoid because of my past", "150:10", "that uh that sponsors might get pissed", "150:12", "at what i'm saying but", "150:14", "when i look at the shows especially the", "150:15", "shows i've been doing the past year", "150:17", "or so

"150:45", "and uh it it came off", "150:48", "as very angry uh", "150:51", "and then as as uh time went on i i", "150:55", "realized like", "150:56", "people were telling me god dude just be", "150:59", "funny like just", "151:00", "joke about shit and you don't have to be", "151:02", "serious like i thought for some reason i", "151:03", "had to do almost like a political show", "151:06",
