and we have to kind", "35:20", "of quantify what what is more important", "35:22", "like if you get the exact same amount of", "35:25", "time but one thing hurt the guy and one", "35:27", "thing didn't is that a you know is that", "35:32", "a does it go towards because he goes go", "35:35", "towards the kickboxer or to go towards", "35:37", "to like the one half of the round where", "35:39",

"35:48", "side I feel like monster doll did more", "35:50", "damage and that that should be worth", "35:52", "something but a second part of it like", "35:54", "he was threatening at Moskva doll wasn't", "35:57", "threatening at all once my", "35:58", "got on his back you know so once my I", "36:02", "got on his back is like Jesus man this", "36:05", "is a this is a constrictor on top of you", "36:08", "and you know Marvin all did defend at", "36:11", "one time and at the end of one of the", "36:13", "rounds got the first round I believe got", "36:16", "Maya off his back and landed some good", "36:18", "shots at my I was trying to take them", "36:20", "down and control him again so he did get", "36:22", "off some damage so arguably he could", "36:25", "have got that round because he did a", "36:26", "little damage in the beginning Maya took", "36:29", "him down and defended successfully and", "36:31", "then he did some damage at the end but", "36:33", "you really have to like have a real", "36:35", "conversation about what's most important", "36:37", "this control most important or his", "36:40", "damage most support or his threat most", "36:42", "important because like Mars Vidal wasn't", "36:44", "close to knocking Maya", "36:46", "out he didn't have a like staggering", "36:48", "around the cage but that could have come", "36:51", "at any moment so it's like there's", "36:52", "threat there and he's clearly hitting", "36:55", "Maya more than Maya's hitting him so you", "36:57", "have to assess like what's more", "36:58", "threatening because when Maya has got", "37:00", "you down it's got your back boy there's", "37:02", "a really high likelihood you're getting", "37:04", "choked but yet mom's did all figured out", "37:06", "a way to get out of that so he should", "37:08", "also get a little bit of credit for his", "37:10", "great defense but more credit should be", "37:13", "tomorrow to Maya's control and Maya's", "37:16", "attacking and Maya's owning the position", "37:18", "like he pretty much control the position", "37:20", "for a good chunk of that fight when he", "37:22", "got the back or when he got him on the", "37:24", "ground so

that are in Las Vegas some", "37:35", "depends on the Commission that's a good", "37:38", "question I think I would have to I'd", "37:40", "have to look it up to be sure but I", "37:42", "think some
