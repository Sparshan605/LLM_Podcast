like these list first", "07:11", "of all these lists are always weird", "07:13", "because like especially when you it's a", "07:15", "someone subjective opinion and there's", "07:17", "nothing wrong with that but it like who", "07:18", "the fuck are you like who's this seat", "07:20", "it's it's who is this person", "07:22", "I would like to see Chris Rock's list", "07:23", "yeah of top ten

"07:50", "thing is I need to watch it", "07:52", "I've only watched parts of it but my", "07:55", "reaction to it was my reaction to", "07:58", "everybody else's reaction so I'm like", "08:00", "what

because I think it is", "08:09", "it's like it's it's I like a lot of", "08:12", "people were saying it's like a TED talk", "08:13", "and I think it kind of is", "08:15", "it's a funny TED talk nothing wrong with", "08:17", "that yeah there's nothing I mean this is", "08:19", "my point on all this it's like why do we", "08:22", "need these sort of parameters that", "08:26", "comedy has to stay in before we accept", "08:29", "it because it doesn't have to be your", "08:31", "kind of shit Yeah right for it to be", "08:33", "something that people enjoy obviously", "08:35", "someone enjoys

include that we got to", "08:43", "make sure we have X amount of women or X", "08:45", "amount you can see there's almost like", "08:46", "there's a thought process behind", "08:48", "creating these lists but some of those", "08:51", "people will appear on those lists over", "08:53", "and over", "08:53", "again so that means to me for sure", "08:55", "somebody loves that special like that",

"60:07", "know that that's not really the bone", "60:09", "that is all the mineral that has", "60:11", "replaced the bone over like thousands", "60:14", "and millions of years or whatever it", "60:15", "takes yeah but something's fossilized", "60:16", "like if you see like a fossilized like", "60:19", "shark tooth and it's black that's it's", "60:21", "not the real color of the teeth it's the", "60:24", "color of all the minerals that have", "60:25", "replaced what the tooth used to be as it", "60:28", "remains compressed and all this sludge", "60:30", "and mud and shit over millions
