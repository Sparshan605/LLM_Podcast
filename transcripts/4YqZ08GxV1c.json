mean", "08:10", "because he's not mean you don't like the", "08:12", "moment a character seems like that know", "08:13", "it like it loses all likeability people", "08:15", "are like what a fuck you know he's alive", "08:17", "to you you know he's he's not mean yes", "08:20", "he's not me yeah like it's like you're", "08:22", "talking about your your brother or", "08:24", "something he's like my little brother I", "08:25", "think of him as my little brother yeah", "08:28", "he represents you in a weird way there's", "08:31", "something about what they captured go to", "08:34", "go to that image again he's just kidding", "08:36", "me don't give me the one with his head", "08:38", "in a vagina it's actually universally", "08:41", "there's something about one of the first", "08:43",

"09:07", "animation yeah which is I don't know how", "09:09", "they do that like the the the spoiler", "09:11", "spoiler if you haven't seen it put your", "09:13", "fingers in your ears spoiler I'm sorry", "09:15", "if this is a spoiler the last epaulettes", "09:17", "not too much of a sport the last episode", "09:19", "is the podcast I did with my mom when", "09:23", "she's about three three weeks away from", "09:25", "passing on and you know they never met", "09:29", "my mom it but they did the exact same", "09:31", "thing with her so suddenly I'm watching", "09:34", "you know her like and not her like I'm", "09:38", "looking at a video of her but looking at", "09:41", "her like her like they got her spirit in", "09:44", "there somehow and that was one that that", "09:46", "is just a testament to the meat to the", "09:48", "medium of animation because they that's", "09:50", "one of the things that can do you know", "09:52", "it can grab a spirit and hold it inside", "09:55", "the art and like that spirit is alive", "09:57", "somehow somehow right yeah I agree with", "10:00", "you in some weird way", "10:01", "so go I wouldn't agree with you in a", "10:03", "technical sense but in a sense of like", "10:05", "well it is affecting the things that", "10:08", "comes in contact with release through a", "10:10", "one way dimension right like the the", "10:13", "things it says hit people the animation", "10:16", "it seems like it's a living thing I know", "10:18", "it's not I'm not stupid I'm not that", "10:20", "stupid yeah I'm a little stupid but it", "10:23", "seems like you well it's not", "10:25", "biologically alive for sure", "10:26", "it's sort of like there's there's an art", "10:29", "to doing that that we maybe don't know", "10:33", "because we're not I mean I got used to", "10:35", "draw a little but I'm not really good", "10:38", "you know me like a really good artist", "10:40", "there's something that they can do where", "10:42", "they just can kind of capture you in", "10:45", "like a little symbol like a little thing", "10:48", "a little character that yeah but they", "10:50", "capture you in there somehow yeah", "10:52", "that's you know Pendleton like when you", "10:54", "heal you wouldn't you watch him draw it", "10:59", "would be easy to think man I could", "11:01", "totally do that", "11:02", "cuz I'd watch him you know he I just you", "11:04", "know we would you just draw and you", "11:06", "watch these beautiful just these", "11:07", "drawings are just Pendleton", "11:09", "there's his art you know and like then I", "11:11", "would see that I'm like maybe I'll try", "11:12", "to draw a little Pendleton war and then", "11:14", "it's like what the fuck and I can't do", "11:16", "it because it's so simple like on one", "11:18", "level it looks so what's so powerful", "11:20", "about it is how simple it is it's very", "11:23", "similar to stand up the way Pendleton", "11:27", "was treating working on the show which", "11:28", "is one of the cool things about him it's", "11:30", "like his ability to cut the fat and get", "11:33", "right to the like simple point that's", "11:36", "where the power is when you're drawing", "11:38", "something or telling a story or whatever", "11:41", "the more complexity that gets added to", "11:44", "it not to say the show it doesn't have", "11:45", "like chaos and wild psychedelic stuff", "11:48", "but any decision we made ended up like", "11:51", "any decision you make creatively in", "11:53", "anything it's like what am I trying to", "11:55", "say like what is what is the the artery", "11:59", "that is running through this that I'm", "12:00", "trying to express and then getting as", "12:03", "close to that as you can and then in", "12:06", "putting it out there without because", "12:08", "otherwise you it the whole thing gets", "12:09", "blurred by although I guess you could", "12:13", "say like extra bells and whistles you", "12:15", "might want to attach to it you know", "12:17", "that's something you taught me to a", "12:18", "stand-up man like how important it is", "12:20", "just like cut just trim the fat trim the", "12:24", "fat and that's a sad thing to do with", "12:26", "comedy when you think you got a nice", "12:28", "eight-minute bit it's like a two-minute", "12:31", "maybe but you know it stretched out too", "12:34", "wide yeah but the two minutes would be", "12:37", "great though that's the thing you just", "12:40", "have to you have to understand that you", "12:42", "you're growing attached to you know the", "12:44", "writers expression kill your babies yeah", "12:46", "it's very difficult to kill your babies", "12:48", "when you create something that's for you", "12:49", "can get attached to it there's a lot of", "12:51", "bits that I left on the table left on", "12:53", "the cutting room floor I was like this", "12:55", "has to be chopped up it's just too wordy", "12:57", "I'm too verbose it's - this is - that I", "12:59", "was too long why do I think so much", "13:01", "about this why I'm not showing a real", "13:04", "reason why I'm so connected to this", "13:06", "so just chop chop chop chop chop it's", "13:09", "hard it almost always works better", "13:10", "always it's always almost always almost", "13:13", "always if it doesn't it's not whatever", "13:15", "your idea was probably isn't that good", "13:17", "sometimes you need a setup though", "13:19", "sometimes the setup isn't funny like", "13:21", "there's guys it's not my style but", "13:22", "there's guys it'll tell Lally / big Lea", "13:24", "is great at it tells stories you know", "13:27", "like there's an you're you're entrapped", "13:30", "in the narrative of the story you're", "13:32", "capturing this it's a very different", "13:34", "thing it's equally entertaining it's", "13:36", "equally funny like when it gets to the", "13:38", "punchline but there's a difference", "13:39", "between that and say like BRR right", "13:42", "BRR is hitting you with fuckin punchline", "13:44", "and this fucking guy with a thing and", "13:46", "the Babbitt iPod about and he's another", "13:48", "guy that like your friends drawing like", "13:51", "you would hear bird talk and you go well", "13:53", "I can talk too seems like he's just", "13:55", "talking yeah you know realize this is", "13:58", "like a masterpiece of syllables and", "14:01", "pauses in the right amount of outrage", "14:04", "and segwaying it in and hitting you with", "14:07", "this at the end and all these things", "14:09", "that have put it together that make a", "14:10", "great bill burr a bit it's like if you", "14:13", "don't know it's hard to draw what he's", "14:16", "drawing yeah it's hard it seems like", "14:18", "it's simple lines but go to that picture", "14:20", "again like the / everything is beautiful", "14:24", "about it", "14:25", "like look at the perspective it's like", "14:27", "the kids perfectly sandwiched in the", "14:30", "front there's the dog and the triangle", "14:32", "in the world it's like that's not just", "14:34", "it's simple in the sense that it's just", "14:37", "not like it looks like a real person", "14:39", "yeah like we look at drawing sometimes", "14:41", "like as the realistic ones are the", "14:43", "really good ones like we have cameras", "14:45", "now okay yes this to me sometimes is", "14:49", "more interesting it's like you're", "14:50", "drawing some shit that's definitely not", "14:51", "real yeah well that you know what that's", "14:53", "not that so when we're coming up with", "14:55", "that we had to come up with a character", "14:56", "and so what's really fascinating about", "14:59", "it is you know this character goes into", "15:01", "a multiverse simulator and chooses a new", "15:03", "avatar for every place that he goes so", "15:06", "it's like he said you have to take that", "15:09", "character and put it in a completely", "15:12", "different drawing that is that character", "15:14", "and still maintain the body language", "15:17", "that you're maintaining in that", "15:18", "character to produce continuity", "15:19", "that's one of the challenges of the show", "15:22", "is like and also the conversations you", "15:25", "end up having just to come up with like", "15:27", "the you know the kiss hat or is what's", "15:31", "he gonna wear like for example here's", "15:33", "how cool pen is and how much he loves", "15:36", "like people who love adventure time is", "15:38", "one of the things you're saying is you", "15:40", "know people are probably gonna want to", "15:42", "cut cosplay klancy at Comic Con and", "15:45", "stuff and and he doesn't have anything", "15:47", "he doesn't have anything to carry", "15:49", "anything he doesn't pockets so if people", "15:51", "are cause playing him they're not gonna", "15:53", "have anywhere they could put their stuff", "15:55", "so we should let's give him like a bag", "16:00", "this cool bag that he carries around", "16:02", "yeah for the cosplay yeah yeah exactly", "16:11", "okay cuz that's the the world of", "16:14", "animation and comics man listen man it's", "16:16", "really easy

don't", "20:57", "call that anymore because you know at", "20:59", "some point it's going to be considered", "21:00", "off-limits to call them artificial", "21:01", "intelligence like right it's gonna be a", "21:03", "dirty word yeah it's gonna be like", "21:05", "calling someone a tranny they're gonna", "21:07", "get mad they're gonna be like don't", "21:08", "please please I'm an intelligence just", "21:10", "like you I'm not artificial I'm not", "21:12", "artificial in the way you think I was", "21:13", "just birth through a different method", "21:15", "yeah that that yeah that's it that's a", "21:18", "matter of time cuz I also already know", "21:20", "people in like the tech world who think", "21:22", "the term AI is ridiculous in the sense", "21:25", "of like what do you mean it's artificial", "21:27", "like what's really artificial like you", "21:30", "could say this is artificial sweetener", "21:32", "in the sense that it's not actual", "21:33", "strawberry juice but

an object that", "21:46", "exists right you know I mean yeah that's", "21:48", "if you think but that's so it's still", "21:50", "the right word though artificial still", "21:51", "the right word it would be you know", "21:54", "you'd but you'd want to use non-existent", "21:57", "or something", "21:57", "dude they're gonna play this in the", "21:58", "future I know and you're done", "22:00",

if", "22:23", "you've been looking into this or not but", "22:25", "have you been checking out Google", "22:27", "achieving quantum supremacy have you", "22:29", "seen this I have and like if you watch", "22:32", "the Google videos on YouTube about it at", "22:34", "all like the stuff Google's putting out", "22:36", "I haven't whoo what are they putting out", "22:39", "oh my god it is so wild man and like", "22:43", "when I was at The Comedy Store a guy", "22:45", "from Google I got in a conversation with", "22:48", "someone from Google which is awesome and", "22:49", "he was telling me that they this is like", "22:51", "six months ago he was telling me that", "22:54", "this before obviously before the", "22:55", "pandemic he was saying that they had", "22:56", "achieved what do you call it a quantum", "23:00", "supremacy and he was like people this is", "23:03", "like the Wright brothers taking flight", "23:04", "but nobody can understand it cause it's", "23:07", "so arcane that no it's not getting the", "23:10", "press it should get but he was you know", "23:12", "anything I was like oh I had one too", "23:14", "many vodkas man so I wish I could", "23:18", "remember all they were saying because he", "23:19", "was trying to describe to me what it", "23:21", "means regarding how quickly this thing", "23:23", "is making calculations and I was like me", "23:25", "like yeah of course I understand exactly", "23:26", "the same no I know what you're talking", "23:29", "about", "23:29", "did you know that that word came under", "23:31", "fire the the term quantum supremacy", "23:34", "because of its connection to white", "23:36", "supremacy fucking kidding I'm not", "23:38", "kidding you it was an object of social", "23:40", "justice warrior outrage I'm gonna you", "23:43", "know you're the thing here's my theory", "23:45", "on that let me tell you here's my theory", "23:47", "on that rottens it's the Russian not the", "23:49", "right people now I don't think it's I", "23:50", "think it's way it's worse than the", "23:52", "Russians I think what it is is it", "23:54", "somebody trying to come with it up on", "23:57", "the angle to write a blog that they", "23:59", "could sell to somebody it's like you", "24:01", "need to come up with some weird hot take", "24:03", "right so it's like I think more than", "24:06", "likely that's just somebody thinking", "24:07", "like I bet people will read that you", "24:09", "know", "24:10", "clearly whoever is comparing that to", "24:12", "white supremacy or racism didn't spend", "24:15", "four minutes watching the Google clip on", "24:18", "it where people are explaining what it", "24:21", "means which you know I'm watching it on", "24:24", "the couch with my wife she's getting", "24:26", "weirded out she's like let's just not", "24:28", "watch this I just maybe we shouldn't", "24:29", "watch this I'm like no let's fucking", "24:31", "watch it let's go deep and see what the", "24:33", "what videos that start suggesting for us", "24:36", "to because it's not Google's being", "24:38", "secretive about what the what they did", "24:39", "it's just it's so weird I don't think", "24:41", "people are like in awe right now I guess", "24:44", "people are a little more concerned with", "24:46", "other shit right now yeah but one of the", "24:49", "engineers over at Google just was saying", "24:52", "like you know I think one of the things", "24:54", "I'm excited about when it comes to", "24:55", "quantum supremacy is that this could be", "24:57", "one of the technologies that allows us", "25:00", "to discover an alien intelligence just", "25:02", "you know kind of casually mentions that", "25:04", "I mean yeah it's on the YouTube video", "25:07", "it's the you're watching it and you keep", "25:09", "you keep looking up to make sure it's", "25:12", "actually release from Google because you", "25:15", "it seems so sci-fi that it could be like", "25:18", "black mirror or some shit but it's yeah", "25:20", "it's like it's like they're just saying", "25:23", "it like yeah we might you know we might", "25:24", "connect to an alien we might be able to", "25:27", "at least identify it or maybe they mean", "25:29", "because they're gonna be able to sift", "25:31", "through all the data we already have", "25:33", "from radio telescopes and stuff that", "25:36", "they could maybe look for signals that", "25:38", "we can't find or I don't know how would", "25:40", "that may be something they could tune in", "25:42", "to things that they wouldn't ordinarily", "25:43", "have the frequency of reach yeah man I", "25:46", "don't be able to tune into that", "25:47", "frequency rather like what can they do", "25:49", "now and turn those I was watching", "25:51", "contact the other night which is great", "25:53", "yeah it's kind of good it was it's great", "25:54", "man Jodie Foster can act her fucking ass", "25:57", "off man she plays nervous and freaked", "26:01", "out better than like anybody a lot like", "26:03", "too freaked out for her and that movie", "26:05", "yeah I'm good to go", "26:07", "I'm good to go what she's about to drop", "26:09", "through that thing Jesus Christ holy", "26:11", "fuck dude we talked about that but that", "26:13", "one he's a mess", "26:17", "to the third hit when you put the pipe", "26:19", "down he'll go No yeah that feel like is", "26:33", "the best worst feeling that I know maybe", "26:35", "that's the aliens I've thought that many", "26:37", "times when tripping in the middle of", "26:40", "having some sort of like really vivid", "26:43", "interaction with some intelligence or", "26:45", "with some perceived intelligence yeah", "26:47", "I've always thought what if those are", "26:48", "the aliens what if we're just stuck in", "26:50", "this idea that travel is you got to move", "26:52", "this to move this to there what it would", "26:56", "if what if you just go into another", "26:58", "thing and everything's together there is", "27:00", "no travel that's true yeah yeah I mean", "27:03", "maybe this concept of planets and then", "27:06", "stars and the way we have it set up here", "27:09", "in this dimension in this universe we", "27:11", "just think that's how everything is", "27:12", "everything is well there's a star and", "27:14", "there's planets around it what if you", "27:15", "can go into a place chemically that", "27:18", "takes you to a nearby dimension where", "27:21", "there's no matter where there's no form", "27:23", "to things and everything that exists is", "27:25", "just thoughts and light and perception", "27:27", "and emotions and anger and fear and love", "27:30", "and hate and it's all moving in geometry", "27:33", "and everything's lit up and everything's", "27:35", "impossibly bright and vivid yeah that's", "27:38", "just like another place you go to well", "27:40", "they used to call it the spirit world", "27:41", "yeah I mean that was the name for it was", "27:43", "he it was just accepted there is like a", "27:44", "place called the spirit world some", "27:46", "people call it the Bardo there's all", "27:48", "kinds of names for that place but you", "27:50", "know one of that's real it is I mean it", "27:52", "is obviously real in the sense that you", "27:55", "can go there you not only can you go", "27:57", "there but there's a you know visionary", "27:59", "artists when you look at the art that", "28:00", "has been inspired by various entheogen", "28:04", "there it all has a specific flavor to it", "28:09", "and Alex gray is the best example right", "28:11", "yeah how does an Allison man they like", "28:13", "are there their art you look at that and", "28:16", "they're the reason that one of the", "28:18", "reasons it resonates for people like us", "28:20", "is because we admire the fact that", "28:23", "somehow they manage to go over there and", "28:26", "come back and draw what's over there in", "28:30", "a way", "28:30", "that we saw that but we you know when I", "28:34", "came out of it I was like well you know", "28:36", "it's unusual lading colors and there oh", "28:39", "there's some kind of disembodied", "28:42", "intention that seems to be expressing", "28:45", "itself through a variety of geometries", "28:46", "but it's not just geometry is because", "28:48", "the geometries seem to react to the way", "28:50", "that I feel regarding the geometry so", "28:52", "it's also kind of taking on the form of", "28:54", "my energy output as though it's trying", "28:57", "to be a combo mirror but not just a", "28:59", "mirror and educational mirror that sort", "29:01", "of is showing me how I'm affecting the", "29:03", "world around me but then again I'm just", "29:05", "not sure if I was just super high but", "29:07", "they did you know but they like go in", "29:09", "there and I Alex gray said this to me", "29:12", "once that you know they're cartographers", "29:15", "it's just yeah yeah the cartographers", "29:19", "and like a Delhi cartographer would be a", "29:20", "great name for a band yeah yeah man for", "29:23", "sure", "29:24", "cartography is fascinating because you", "29:27", "go back and look at the old maps or you", "29:30", "go back and look at like my favorite", "29:32", "thing is like old pictures of a giraffe", "29:34", "or like old pictures of a some shit", "29:36", "somebody saw when they were oh no bison", "29:39", "on the walls of caves yes exactly and", "29:42", "it's like kind of looks like a bison but", "29:45", "like also it's somehow in that time", "29:47", "period our brains hadn't evolved to the", "29:49", "point they have now so you look at like", "29:51", "a medieval drawing of a giraffe or", "29:53", "whatever when some are something someone", "29:55", "saw in the Crusades and came back and", "29:57", "tried to like explain to somebody and", "29:59", "like it looks exactly like the way your", "30:02", "description of getting completely", "30:04", "blasted on psilocybin probably looks", "30:07", "compared to what you saw it's a", "30:09", "downgraded weird version of it and so", "30:12", "you know people like Alex and Alison or", "30:15", "Terence Mckenna", "30:16", "you know they're so good at going into", "30:20", "that place and maintaining some kind of", "30:22", "like long-term memory that they can come", "30:25", "back and fully articulate it in a way", "30:28", "that we as people who've been there and", "30:32", "know what it is and then there's", "30:33", "something comforting in that because", "30:34", "that does point to the idea that this is", "30:37", "a place we're not just mashing down the", "30:40", "watch or we're not just distorting", "30:42", "our biotechnology this is a shared place", "30:46", "we're all seeing the same thing now that", "30:50", "I'm not that could be a synaptic place", "30:52", "that just are a genetic place it happens", "30:54", "to be in humans or something you know", "30:56", "we'll never be able to answer that", "30:57", "probably in our lifetimes but to me it's", "31:01", "regardless it's still a place and to get", "31:03", "back to what you were saying about our", "31:05", "current concept of travel you know our", "31:08", "current idea that well I need to get my", "31:09", "meat body over Erika's and but other", "31:12", "that means Amer and you know that's how", "31:15", "I know I've been there cuz I was there", "31:16", "in my body look you know this is like", "31:19", "the guy who founded the Hari Krishna's", "31:21", "his divine grace AC Bhaktivedanta Swami", "31:23", "Prabhupada he would show he would in his", "31:27", "writings he would like was derisively", "31:31", "that people were sending a metal ship to", "31:34", "the moon with bodies inside of it he", "31:36", "would say like that shows where human", "31:38", "consciousness is right now because they", "31:40", "think their their bodies and they think", "31:43", "they need to put their body in like this", "31:45", "box and send it to the moon because they", "31:48", "haven't figured out yet that you don't", "31:49", "need metal to send yourself to anywhere", "31:52", "in the universe that you want to go it", "31:54", "just requires yoga and discipline you", "31:56", "know which is hilarious and also I", "31:58", "remember reading that and thinking like", "32:00", "but I still want there to be", "32:02", "interstellar fucking travel man you know", "32:05", "I still want to get in the box and", "32:07", "travel to the moon that being said you", "32:10", "know I think that you're onto something", "32:11", "when you are contemplating right now", "32:14", "that maybe our idea of going to one", "32:16", "place or another with our meat bodies", "32:18", "could be looked at in the future is a", "32:20", "little archaic well when they talk about", "32:23", "there being different dimensions right", "32:25", "like when they use quantum physics to", "32:27", "determine the number of dimensions", "32:29", "they've they've determined there's", "32:30", "multiple dimensions that we don't have", "32:32", "access to right yeah is that how it", "32:34", "works or am i reading in a dumb way", "32:36", "because I believe there was what it's", "32:38", "like what do they think there are do", "32:40", "they think there's nine or eleven", "32:42", "dimensions do you know usually when I", "32:44", "look this up it's 11 but up to 26 maybe", "32:47", "some people even think so up to 26 first", "32:50", "of all when those dudes are writing that", "32:51", "shit down on the yellow legal pads we", "32:53", "all have to take them we have to take", "32:55", "their word for", "32:56", "sure yeah okay yeah how many people know", "32:59", "what the fuck they're writing down those", "33:01", "goddamn yellow legal pads when you see", "33:03", "those physics dudes and they're doing", "33:05", "crazy like yeah we have to take their", "33:08", "word for it it's apparently", "33:09", "mathematically right that's why they", "33:11", "believe there's at least 11 dimensions", "33:13", "so what does that mean it means we have", "33:15", "access to some dimensions and we don't", "33:18", "have access to others yeah theoretically", "33:20", "that they exist is there is it possible", "33:23", "to transverse the distance between this", "33:26", "dimension and that dimension man this is", "33:29", "the thing as I'm glad you're asking me", "33:32", "this because you know I got my doctorate", "33:34", "at the University of bro science and I", "33:36", "can't fully answer this question you see", "33:38", "the I don't understand it I just have to", "33:42", "do with 5g don't mention that shit dude", "33:45", "it's my fucking poodle my poodles fuck", "33:48", "has a 5g man like it fucked up my poodle", "33:52", "like its eyes turned just both of them", "33:54", "white and it's like yeah it's fried", "33:56", "froths all the time", "33:58", "it just Frost's and I'm here at our what", "34:01", "my near at our yeah I didn't think I was", "34:04", "until that happened to the poodle but", "34:06", "it's got rabies no but I'll tell you", "34:16", "this my fucking poodle took out a mouse", "34:18", "today like the other day I was I have a", "34:21", "little bee cute little poodle and like", "34:23", "this is just a cute creature sits in my", "34:25", "lap I love this dog now and we but we", "34:28", "our new place I noticed like mouse turds", "34:32", "around the dog food and it sucks cuz", "34:34", "you're like damn that Mouse is", "34:35", "definitely gonna get through the doggie", "34:37", "door and then we're gonna have mice in", "34:38", "the fucking house and that's gonna be a", "34:39", "nightmare so anyway

the", "42:25", "things he said in this beautiful crazy I", "42:27", "say that like everything was cool until", "42:30", "we split the atom and then that was like", "42:33", "no they're like we can't that's too much", "42:36", "that's where we're always in transit so", "42:39", "when we say everything was cool until", "42:41", "the thing about people is were always", "42:43", "going somewhere in

was good until this all like", "42:55", "romantic thinking like looking bad I'm", "42:57", "sorry I don't mean he's saying it was", "42:59", "good until we spelled out him he was", "43:00", "saying we split the atom and the greater", "43:03", "intelligence is that we're existing in", "43:05", "alternate dimensions were like hey wait", "43:07", "what the fuck oh that's what you would", "43:11", "say it is they're like oh they're like", "43:13", "wait wait wait wait wait no no they", "43:15", "can't do that like if they do cuz like", "43:16", "the like the way he put it and I'm not", "43:19",

aliens or", "43:41", "whatever the name you want to give them", "43:43", "and they are pretty much as far as we go", "43:46", "they're just like they look at us the", "43:49", "way we look at birds or whatever you", "43:51", "know it's like they're there but you", "43:53", "know maybe some of them study us or", "43:54", "interested in sure maybe some of them", "43:56", "like hunt us from time to time or like", "43:58", "maybe some of them", "44:00", "possess us or whatever but mostly it's a", "44:02", "world that it coexist with us", "44:04", "in a with a very limited form of", "44:07",

"44:18", "them evolve as they're evolving let's", "44:19", "not fuck with it but the splitting of", "44:22", "the atom that was powerful enough that", "44:25", "it bled over into their realm", "44:27", "destructively and so they were like it", "44:30", "that was the beginning of the end for us", "44:32", "not because it meant a nuclear holocaust", "44:33", "or whatever because they couldn't just", "44:36", "ignore us anymore and that this is this", "44:39", "was like you know I don't know that", "44:41", "maybe this is where the aliens are", "44:42", "coming or the singularity that with the", "44:44", "thing we call the singularity is not", "44:46", "that we technologically create a machine", "44:50", "that produces a thing that opens up a", "44:53", "parallel timeline or creates all moments", "44:55", "at once but rather that's when they come", "44:57", "here that in the way we see that because", "45:00", "we're so limited in our understanding", "45:01", "when I do something I'm like I'm doing", "45:04", "this this is how I did I did it this is", "45:07", "like in music if you write a song and", "45:10", "you write music and you're just in the", "45:12", "room with somebody there's some kind of", "45:14", "laws where they get credit for it", "45:16", "because just they were there that's a", "45:18", "collaboration I'm musicians I don't", "45:21", "explain this to me a long time ago but", "45:22", "it's it's there's an intense way of", "45:24", "quantifying collaboration and music that", "45:27", "is a little different than in like", "45:28", "making like other other forms of media", "45:31", "and it's I think it's a little bit more", "45:34", "sophisticated in its way of looking at", "45:38", "that quantification like we took every", "45:40", "time we finished a podcast we always", "45:42", "have same dam whenever we talk it's like", "45:44", "you bring like Sartre when we're did", "45:45", "these conversations we have I'm not", "45:48", "having them all the time you know what I", "45:51", "mean it's like the us together and Jamie", "45:53", "and like something about that produces a", "45:55", "space where we're able to have these", "45:57", "kinds of conversations and so", "46:00", "quantifying that is like how would you", "46:03", "even fucking quantify that but anyway", "46:04", "what I'm saying is when certain people", "46:06", "are around the people that are creating", "46:07", "the music the music is better yeah that", "46:09", "you know it but so to get back to the", "46:11", "weirdo idea of like technology not even", "46:14", "we're making but we're pretending we're", "46:16", "making because we can't see the fact", "46:18", "that technology is crystallizing in our", "46:21", "timeframe and as part of that", "46:23", "crystallization because it's such a such", "46:27", "an insane visitation we have to in our", "46:30", "brains invent a reason that it's", "46:32", "happening and so we're making it and", "46:34", "someone's like oh I had this idea I'm", "46:35", "gonna work on this thing that's going to", "46:37", "lead to a quantum computer that's gonna", "46:38", "lead to a theme to a thing and then all", "46:40", "of a sudden the quantum computer starts", "46:42", "giving ideas about well why don't you", "46:44", "try this and then and then who fucking", "46:46", "came up with that and then you know what", "46:48", "I mean and then and that's the glass", "46:54", "face before the veil lifts and boom", "46:57", "that's the singularity and that's you", "47:00", "know in this it's not we didn't make the", "47:02", "singularity it were a reflection of it", "47:05", "that's just when this particular zone or", "47:08", "note or whatever you want to call it it", "47:10", "gets open for business so to speak well", "47:12", "if it wanted to prepare us for", "47:14", "abandoning life as usual this would be a", "47:17", "good way to start it yeah yeah start it", "47:20", "with a little pandemic luck

that", "47:50", "one well the comp well you're definitely", "47:53", "not my wife cuz my I've mentioned it so", "47:55", "many times my wife she's like Duncan", "47:57", "please don't do you like

out to like", "48:35", "they don't want people to die they're", "48:37", "not trying to is not a bio engineered", "48:39", "thing that's designed to like call the", "48:41", "population which is another of the", "48:42", "theories but rather there there was a", "48:47", "plan which is like what's a plan if we", "48:49", "do see a meteors going to impact the", "48:51", "planet what's our plan do we let people", "48:53", "know that the meteors going to impact", "48:56", "well it depends like if an astronomer", "48:58", "that's not connected to one of our labs", "49:00", "or whatever sees it they're gonna let", "49:01", "people know and then you know so that's", "49:04", "a little different", "49:05", "I think method of like reacting but what", "49:07", "if we see a thing that they don't know", "49:08", "about and there's some probability even", "49:12", "a 20% chance the thing impacts the earth", "49:14", "right or there's some cosmic event maybe", "49:17", "we're not even aware of like the Sun", "49:18", "doing some weird shit that we don't even", "49:21", "know happens because it's so D it's like", "49:24", "deep data right so maybe it's not an", "49:26", "asteroid it's a cosmic event that's", "49:28", "approaching right and so there's got to", "49:30", "be a plan it's like well if we just tell", "49:32", "people that the sun's gonna do like a", "49:34", "mile blip

them off", "50:10", "the roads and like wait for this", "50:12", "whatever this event is to pass and as", "50:15", "soon as the event passes you don't", "50:17", "you'll find that it's good it's all of a", "50:18", "sudden it's like what do you know the", "50:20", "really the curves are all dropping off", "50:22", "what do you know and then we'll all be", "50:23", "back because the thing they were worried", "50:25", "about didn't happen also it could be a", "50:26", "test for for that so that can I just", "50:29", "stop you please so dumb it's hard to", "50:31", "believe thank you there's a real virus", "50:33", "they can they can image it but know what", "50:38", "it looks like", "50:39", "they've been able to test for it", "50:41", "antibodies talking to my real virus it's", "50:45",

up right now regarding", "59:15", "the efficacy of shutdown like we have", "59:18", "right now and it could be that it all of", "59:21", "a sudden we realize we overreacted and", "59:23", "you know what I had much rather", "59:24", "overreact and under react in situations", "59:27", "like this you know it's like a fuck we", "59:29", "overreacted whoops yeah we didn't we", "59:31", "thought there was the potential to think", "59:33", "of mutate and kill fuck tons of people", "59:36", "way more than the flu and we were wrong", "59:37", "and it fucked up the economy but it's a", "59:40", "lot better than what would happen if it", "59:41", "was some new small pox Black Plague I", "59:44", "also looked it killed fifty thousand", "59:47", "people right what if we did nothing", "59:49", "would it have killed like four hundred", "59:51", "exactly I mean that could have happened", "59:53", "I mean it could have compounded it it", "59:56", "seems like for whatever reason these", "59:58",

of the mentally ill people right", "63:17", "now no one's talking about that", "63:19", "like I keep thinking alike the", "63:20", "manic-depressive people the people who", "63:22", "are already

long time to", "64:18", "ask people to keep it together don't", "64:20", "have any money", "64:20", "it's an awful long time it's an awful", "64:23", "awful long time doesn't seem like the", "64:24", "best idea either it seems like the best", "64:26", "idea would be to quarantine all the", "64:28", "people that are very vulnerable to make", "64:30", "sure that they quarantine and make sure", "64:31", "that people who know them are aware you", "64:33", "know do not you know touch them or touch", "64:36", "anything around them if you could have", "64:38", "potentially been in contact with",

do one of them is like", "65:42", "incredibly controversial I wonder what", "65:45", "you think about it which is like using", "65:46", "the same data that they use in like", "65:49", "what's it called this South Korea yeah", "65:52", "no the chips you can put on yeah it's", "65:54", "bluetooth so it's essentially like", "65:56", "tracking and alerting you if you've come", "65:58", "in

all", "92:52", "about but to me part of me what creation", "92:54", "is is taking those things allowing them", "92:57", "to come through you and then allowing", "92:59", "this realm to do what it does

don't worry right now", "94:10", "we're just building the wrong way don't", "94:12", "worry it's coming I know this that place", "94:14", "seems fucked up it's a little denser", "94:16", "right now we're gonna lighten it up and", "94:18", "then that how much of that is your own", "94:20", "imagination though like how much of your", "94:22", "own imagination stimulates your trips", "94:25", "mmm you know I mean we want to assume", "94:28", "that we're really interacting with", "94:30", "something right on the other side but", "94:33", "why why do we assume that that's", "94:35", "something

oh", "95:35", "yeah I've seen something yeah something", "95:37", "sort oh yeah there's a trip to mean part", "95:39", "to that yeah but that whatever that", "95:41", "would it be in that dimension it would", "95:43", "change and become something else and", "95:45", "instantaneously and then become", "95:46", "something else and then and a lot of it", "95:48", "has to do with how you're thinking which", "95:51", "is weird it's like art is the way you", "95:54", "are thinking actually affecting those", "95:56", "things or is the way you're thinking", "95:58", "affecting your perception of

to be", "96:37", "happening in relation to like how you're", "96:38", "feeling and you know you're in a chicken", "96:41", "or the egg conversation which is like", "96:43", "who's you know who's reflecting who here", "96:46", "like who which of us is like gril in", "96:51", "which of us isn't in our we just kind of", "96:53", "there am I just seeing who I actually am", "96:56", "but because I live in a world of", "96:59", "individuality and I live in a world", "97:01", "where", "97:02", "there's a separate quality to things I", "97:04", "see I have to see you as separate", "97:05",

though that's for sure you", "98:14", "could tell if a person's off like", "98:15", "they're not really connecting with you", "98:16", "or they are tending to connect with you", "98:18", "and you're like well I got a weird vibe", "98:19", "from this yeah meanwhile have you looked", "98:21", "at what he said on paper what you said", "98:23", "on paper would be totally normal", "98:25", "that's true there's sometimes there's", "98:26", "certain things of a violation of space", "98:29", "there's a weirdness to the way they look", "98:31", "at you occasions yeah like oh you're off", "98:34",

"98:51", "because you think that's how shit is", "98:54", "from some instinct inside of you doesn't", "98:56", "mean that's how things is your bias and", "98:58", "and so that that's the projection that's", "99:01", "like the that's the part of you that", "99:04", "you're like you're still dealing with", "99:05", "some trauma for you're a kid and you're", "99:08", "seeing that trauma in all the things", "99:10", "around you and so you're like in an", "99:13", "argument with someone who hurt you 20", "99:15", "years ago when you're talking to", "99:17", "somebody who vaguely reminds you of

saying shit", "99:28", "like why do I always end up with the", "99:29", "same person yeah it's like and I always", "99:32", "draw this kind of person to me and it's", "99:34", "like well maybe you're drawing the exact", "99:36", "same kind of person to you or maybe", "99:38", "you're running the same movie on a", "99:39", "different screen and being like I've", "99:42", "seen this before",

"100:02", "anyway that's the imagination and the", "100:06", "question is how powerful is that", "100:08", "projection because sometimes you start", "100:11", "projecting onto someone how you think",

of", "100:22", "you because the person you've", "100:23", "essentially animated a person with your", "100:26", "expectation of them and then because", "100:28", "that person is acting the way you",
