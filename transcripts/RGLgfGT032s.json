we discovered that I was always I", "03:59", "was always preparing to go from the", "04:00", "traditional source which is most famous", "04:02", "for for the source of the Yangtze be you", "04:05",

miles which that's only really a", "04:31", "day's trek but it was more close to", "04:34", "Tibet was more south southwest of China", "04:38", "so it was closer to the Tibetan border", "04:39",

where the Yangtze pulls into the East", "05:15", "China Sea and they're like you know you", "05:17", "only have to go to this this point I'm", "05:19", "like no I'm walking to where the land", "05:21", "ends so that took me an extra only an", "05:23", "extra couple of days but Kim I didn't", "05:25", "finish inside we didn't quite make it", "05:27", "did yeah you were we didn't quite make",

cross the finish line", "06:07", "that almost when that day happened and I", "06:09", "did cross the finish line", "06:10", "I almost over visualized I didn't feel", "06:13", "anything it's just like well so it's", "06:15", "about damn time", "06:16", "you know Wow yeah and I believe you know", "06:19", "the law of attraction visualization I've", "06:21", "always been a big believer in that and", "06:22", "same with Mongolia and Madagascar which", "06:25", "might were my previous expeditions I", "06:27", "almost lost my life on both of those", "06:29", "trips but that sound that I'm suffering", "06:31", "I'm just constantly visualizing you know", "06:33", "I was focusing on recovering getting", "06:35", "better visualizing the finish keep", "06:37", "getting up keep pushing on I want to get", "06:39", "to that", "06:39", "get to those but I want to I want to ask", "06:42", "you when you decide to plan this trip", "06:44", "yeah so how much had you learned from", "06:47", "the first two crazy trips that you had", "06:49", "and how did you calculate like how much", "06:52", "food you're gonna need where you're", "06:53", "gonna meet neat pit stops where you're", "06:55", "gonna be able to like how did you do it", "06:57", "so with that we're always looking for", "06:59", "communities along along Route you know", "07:01", "it's a community there's food and so and", "07:05", "actually that brings me back to the", "07:06", "traditional and then the true scientific", "07:08", "source if we went from the traditional", "07:10", "we'd go maybe one week or one and a half", "07:12", "weeks without coming across any locals", "07:14", "so we'd have to carry a week and a half", "07:16", "worth of Russian packs in our backpack", "07:18", "but that's true in scientific sauce", "07:20", "centers back I think it was two or three", "07:22", "weeks we couldn't find any community", "07:26", "along the way by satellite and via the", "07:29", "people that we were there are my", "07:31", "logistics managers so these need to", "07:33", "carry craziest way to try to visit", "07:35", "people yeah find them through satellite", "07:37", "as you're trekking through a forest yeah", "07:40", "and then try to get food that's it and", "07:42", "we're always maximizing as well so we're", "07:44", "saying okay that's three weeks so let's", "07:46", "carry food for three and a half or four", "07:48", "weeks because if that communities now", "07:50", "empty or abandoned then we're out of", "07:53", "food what what are you carrying for food", "07:55", "I would carry Russian

my god", "16:04", "yes equivalent to Everest base camp I'd", "16:06", "say oh my and get out to cheat sickness", "16:08", "from really fucking high that's 15,000", "16:11", "feet right that's about that yeah yeah", "16:14", "and there's wolves up there there's", "16:17", "wolves yeah what how help us would you", "16:23", "feel at 15,000 feet when you see a pack", "16:25", "of water oh yeah and

"Flint with us as well matches and a", "28:30", "lighter", "28:30", "no no Jetboil or anything like that", "28:33", "because you wouldn't be able to refill", "28:35", "on problems yeah what we had actually we", "28:36", "had a year a bottle that connects to the", "28:39", "stove and with that bottle you can even", "28:41", "fill it up with gasoline but you can", "28:43", "also use vodka whiskey and run off the", "28:46", "vapors", "28:47", "you get pumping up pump the bottle the", "28:49", "vapors leak out sparks a flame and", "28:51", "you're good to go", "28:52", "really yeah so that's

the s'mores in the flame you", "29:33", "don't want that isn't that funny you", "29:35", "would think that like if anything", "29:37", "gasoline would be more fucked", "29:38", "yeah you would yeah that's it yeah yeah", "29:42", "it's probably because it's not all", "29:44", "alcohol right yeah a bunch other shit in", "29:46", "there it's gonna be it's gonna be but if", "29:48", "you had rubbing alcohol pure rubbing", "29:50", "alcohol probably burn even better yeah", "29:51", "potentially how you would thought so", "29:53", "yeah this whole idea that you you had to", "29:57", "do this mm-hmm how much encouragement", "30:00", "did you get from people that you told", "30:02", "the story to and how many people like", "30:03", "you can't do this you're gonna die up", "30:05", "there I'd say a healthy mix for those", "30:08", "who had seen the previous adventures", "30:10", "that I had done they had a they had hope", "30:14", "they held hope they had faith in you", "30:16", "yeah they had faith come on surely he's", "30:18", "got this they knew you'd already", "30:19", "accomplished two amazing things that's", "30:20", "it and it was never done recklessly", "30:22", "first it was never really done for the", "30:24", "record there was always environmental", "30:25", "angle sustainability awareness etc but", "30:29", "it's also the planning so it's not that", "30:32", "I used to do really reckless stuff we'll", "30:33", "get to that but now it's meticulous", "30:35", "planets the details looking at what can", "30:37", "go wrong but also learning how you can", "30:39", "possibly overcome it back home a good", "30:42", "cliffhanger yeah yeah but when you're", "30:48", "walking what kind of equipment are using", "30:51", "are using a GPS and if so do you have", "30:53", "solar panels that you're using to gather", "30:55", "electricity yeah so yeah we would take", "30:58", "solar panels so we had solar panels we", "31:00", "had the a couple of power banks so we'd", "31:03", "use the solar panel to charge the power", "31:04", "bank and then that will charge like the", "31:06", "the GPS the the cameras can I ask you", "31:10", "how you do that are you putting it on", "31:11", "the back of your backpack as you want", "31:13", "that's it yeah which strap it's at the", "31:14", "top of the rucksack okay and you know", "31:17", "it's Mongolia specially is known as the", "31:20", "eternal land of blue sky mm-hmm", "31:22", "and where I was wasn't too far so we did", "31:25", "have a lot of blue sky with decent sun", "31:27", "rays I was able to charge the power bank", "31:29", "and that power bank could last up to", "31:31", "about a week and a half of charging", "31:33", "depend on how I use it so it's really", "31:35", "really useful that's incredible so when", "31:37", "you're walking how much does it take", "31:39", "what is the milliamp hour in the so what", "31:42", "is it I think I think I studied it by", "31:46", "how many charges I can get from the", "31:47", "iPhone so I think it was seven or eight", "31:50", "or eight charges from 0% on the iPhone", "31:53", "to 100% seven to eight straight charges", "31:56", "and care and that sometimes requires", "31:58", "quite a bit sometimes I was just", "31:59", "charging the GoPro or the little", "32:01", "satellite satellite phone and you're", "32:03", "able to get that full charge just from", "32:05", "that solar panel and how long just from", "32:07", "the power bank yeah the solar panel", "32:09", "would take a good while to charge up the", "32:12", "the power bank so what I did is a couple", "32:15", "days I'd say a couple of a couple of", "32:17", "days to get to 100% yeah for sure for", "32:20", "sure 25 to 30% per day I think it was", "32:23", "that's interesting so it seems like you", "32:25", "could almost get everything you need", "32:26", "just in while you're walking everyday", "32:28", "that's it", "32:29", "yeah but you're right there if the days", "32:31", "are good you know if we write access to", "32:33", "blue sky but I took does it work at all", "32:36", "when it's cloudy", "32:37", "it does but painfully slow pay like", "32:40", "maybe after an hour you've bumped up a", "32:43", "percent how crazy is the idea though of", "32:45", "the there stealing energy out of the sky", "32:48", "hazy", "32:48", "yes the Sun the energy the Sun is", "32:51", "powering your phone that's it that's it", "32:53", "I want to do it that way just to do it", "32:55", "that way it just sounds so bad yeah and", "32:57", "that's the air exactly exactly that's", "32:59", "the way the world's moving as well isn't", "33:00", "the energy of the Sun power and your", "33:02", "phone I mean just the world just needs", "33:04", "more efficient ways to use solar and", "33:07", "they're gonna get better at it for sure", "33:08", "yeah far better than it used to be yeah", "33:10", "I was shocked to see it all over China", "33:12", "as well actually so you're", "33:14", "I'd imagine right there's a lot of rural", "33:15", "places in particular that don't really", "33:17", "have too much access to the grid yeah", "33:19", "yeah so when you are you're
