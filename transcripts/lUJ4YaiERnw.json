"05:19", "realizing that automation is coming like", "05:21", "a tidal wave and that your efforts that", "05:23", "you're getting applauded for are really", "05:25", "not gonna do the trick and then

"05:55", "four million manufacturing jobs in the", "05:59", "swing states and Donald Trump is our", "06:01", "president so imagine being me and then", "06:04", "seeing that and being like okay I get it", "06:06", "this is an economic technological story", "06:09", "and then I went to people in Washington", "06:11", "DC I was like hey guys what are we gonna", "06:13", "do we're in the third inning of the", "06:15", "greatest economic and technological", "06:16", "transformation in the history of our", "06:18", "country and the third inning has brought", "06:20", "us Donald Trump the fourth fifth six", "06:23", "things are going to be horrific what are", "06:26", "we gonna do and then the answers I got", "06:28", "were somewhere between disappointing and", "06:30", "horrifying where if you go to mainstream", "06:33", "politicians you know like what are we", "06:34", "gonna do the answers I got were", "06:35", "literally number one we cannot talk", "06:37", "about that number two we should", "06:40", "study that we cannot talk about that was", "06:43", "that's verbatim really yeah and why were", "06:45", "they saying that because it seems", "06:47", "alarmist like anti progress or like you", "06:51", "know you're like you know throwing", "06:53", "stones at like like big tech companies", "06:57", "and it's like I'm not throwing stones at", "06:58", "anyone I'm just pointing out the fact so", "07:00", "number one is so number one was can't", "07:02", "talk about it", "07:03", "number two was need to study it and the", "07:05", "number three was the point you made", "07:07", "originally which was we must educate and", "07:08", "retrain Americans for the jobs of the", "07:10", "future and then when I was like hey", "07:12", "we're terrible at that by the numbers", "07:14", "yeah then they'd literally be like well", "07:16", "I guess we'll learn to get better at it", "07:17", "then and then I so I came back to my", "07:20", "home in New York City and I was like oh", "07:21", "my gosh like we are so backward and far", "07:24", "gone as I certainly as a government and", "07:28", "so then I was grappling with it and I'm", "07:30", "a parent like you are and I looked at my", "07:32", "kids and I was like am I really gonna", "07:34", "bring them up in this shit show like and", "07:38", "so then I was like okay how would you", "07:40", "actually solve this problem if you if", "07:43", "you had to do so and so then I said okay", "07:45", "universal basic income rebranded the", "07:48", "freedom dividend after we did a bunch of", "07:49", "tests because it tests much better as", "07:51", "the freedom dividend the universal basic", "07:53", "income and and then try and make the the", "07:57", "rules of the economy work better for", "07:59", "more people as fast as we can before", "08:00", "this automation wave really crescendos", "08:03", "and then the kind you know", "08:06", "okay sure and then Alzheimer's you know", "08:09", "again I know you're plus plus 50 so you", "08:13", "know cheatsy wants to keep doing this", "08:20", "podcast young forever", "08:22", "that'll be excused to stop so THC has", "08:25", "been shown to inhibit the formation of", "08:27", "beta amyloid plaques so that's the you", "08:29", "know the hallmark of of Alzheimer's", "08:31", "disease and then CBD CBD has also been", "08:35", "shown to be effective for for all stars", "08:37", "disease as well you know it was a rat", "08:39", "study that was gonna get into but it's", "08:41", "it's fairly fairly it's fairly detailed", "08:43", "so you know might be best just to say", "08:45", "that a cane", "08:46", "you know help with rescue memory and", "08:49", "patients if you do use CBD meaning that", "08:51", "it may", "08:52", "actually reverse and that's been shown", "08:54", "before to they've done that in mice", "08:56", "I gotta interrupt you for one second", "08:57", "okay and I think you would agree this", "08:59", "data is some of it's some of it's sort", "09:02", "of epidemiological some of it's", "09:04", "preclinical it's very very early none of", "09:07", "it really proves my dad but but let me", "09:11", "say I'm a clinician okay if someone", "09:13", "comes to me and they have a concussion", "09:15", "it's very fresh strangest to say to them", "09:17", "hey physical cognitive rest go home okay", "09:20", "it's really frustrating to say that's", "09:22", "some also too you know that the high-fat", "09:25", "diet thing you know Joe and I both", "09:26", "follow you know very very similar diet", "09:29", "so that's something that want to share", "09:30", "with regards to you know the the", "09:32", "Alzheimer's disease we have really", "09:34", "really poor medications for that and we", "09:37", "have an aging population so again like", "09:39", "Alex like you want to look at everything", "09:41", "which is what I'm doing like I'm looking", "09:43", "at everything and I'm trying to make a", "09:44", "clinical decision am i using some things", "09:47", "like without you know randomized control", "09:50", "trials of course I am but again on the", "09:52", "clinician so I'm using you know", "09:53", "mechanisms of action I'm using what I've", "09:55", "see and in clinic and I'm using", "09:57", "epidemiological studies and I'm also", "09:59", "taken into account what other medicines", "10:01", "do I have you know based upon all the", "10:03", "data this seems to be ineffective", "10:04", "treatment and I am absolutely not saying", "10:06", "that you as a clinician shouldn't do", "10:08", "that especially your in Canada cannabis", "10:10", "is legal you should you should use your", "10:13", "best judgment what I'm saying is that", "10:14", "when we're talking about policy", "10:17", "decisions around cannabis and THC and to", "10:20", "a much lesser sense CBD the advocacy", "10:23", "groups have seized on this very very", "10:25", "preliminary data to say a lot of things", "10:28", "about cannabis and THC that have not", "10:30", "been proven and you know a guy I know", "10:32", "named Peter Bock who very smart he's a", "10:36", "pulmonologist he's at Memorial", "10:37", "sloan-kettering in New York and he wrote", "10:38", "a piece in The Wall Street Journal a few", "10:41", "a couple weeks ago talking about", "10:43", "cannabis as limits as medicine and he", "10:45", "said something that I thought was so", "10:47", "well put which is the reason why people", "10:49", "want cannabis to work for Alzheimer's", "10:52", "and cancer and a bunch of things where", "10:54", "there's really no evidence that it works", "10:56", "is that we don't have good treatments we", "10:58", "want cures we want help we if we're", "11:02", "clinicians I mean I'm not", "11:03", "clinician your clinician want to be able", "11:05", "to give people who come into our office", "11:06", "is something but that hope is not a", "11:08", "substitute for science it doesn't mean", "11:11", "then it works and even you want you want", "11:14", "your patients to have hope okay", "11:16", "but that advocates the people who are", "11:19", "using this to push especially to push", "11:21", "THC and to capitalize on the public", "11:23", "confusion around THC and CBD I think", "11:26", "that is a real it's a real disservice to", "11:29", "people okay listen I think we covered", "11:34", "everything was a complicated subject", "11:36", "it really is and I think it's really", "11:39", "important to discuss how complicated it", "11:41", "is I don't I don't think there's I've", "11:44", "never heard such a detailed analysis of", "11:46", "all this stuff and in a way where you", "11:49", "can get to opposing people that are you", "11:51", "know very civil about it but agree on", "11:53", "certain aspects of it I think I think we", "11:55", "really highlighted all those things", "12:01", "[Applause]", "English (auto-generated)"]
