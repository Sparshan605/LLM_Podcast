"04:16", "closer to a military conflict with Iran", "04:18", "well these are the same brainiacs that", "04:19", "said he was inching us closer to a war", "04:21", "with North Korea and they everybody was", "04:23", "completely", "04:23", "on that I'm not saying that rouhani and", "04:26", "the others in the Iranian regime might", "04:28", "not you know decide to become more", "04:29", "bellicose but I think they're I think", "04:33", "they're looking at it wrong I mean the", "04:34", "this idea that cuz there's a couple of", "04:37", "parts part one is that they're saying oh", "04:39", "look it you know he doesn't have a plan", "04:40", "P implying that it's either this deal", "04:42", "which even our European allies say is", "04:44", "inadequate right or it's a military", "04:47", "conflict and that's kind of what the", "04:49", "previous president was was all about we", "04:51", "either get this dealer we're having a", "04:52", "military conflict no there's other", "04:54", "things in the works there's other", "04:56", "options in that in that decision tree", "04:58", "and so I think that's that's a false", "05:02", "premise and the other thing when they", "05:03", "talk about it over the past 24 hours", "05:05", "anyways is that well look at this is", "05:07", "gonna make it harder to get a deal with", "05:08", "with Kim internal nuttin from North", "05:10", "Korea's cuz he's gonna think that we", "05:11", "don't we don't support our deals well I", "05:14", "look at a different way I think that Kim", "05:17", "jong-un's gonna look at this and think", "05:18", "okay they're not gonna put up with an", "05:20", "inadequate deal right so he's gonna look", "05:22", "at it and say well yeah that because", "05:24", "nobody disagrees with the Iranian deal", "05:26", "they want to talk about they want to", "05:29", "talk about how look the Iranians are", "05:30", "complying with it well the Iranians are", "05:32", "complying with what they agreed to allow", "05:35", "in the deal right which is none of their", "05:38", "military sites the number of times", "05:40", "inspectors have have actually gotten on", "05:42", "and inspected a military site including", "05:45", "Parchin the most important military", "05:47", "facility in Iran since that deal was", "05:49", "signed in 2015 was zero haven't been", "05:52", "there because the Iranians didn't agree", "05:54", "to allow any of those sites in this deal", "05:58", "so that's like that's like saying that's", "06:01", "like saying if you're a serial killer", "06:02", "you'll allow the police to come in and", "06:04", "search your home but you can't go in the", "06:05", "basement right not that also a cult is", "06:08", "put their bodies in the basement put I", "06:09", "have you know I suspect that's the case", "06:11", "so anyway that's it's an interesting", "06:14", "thing and I guess I wanted to throw that", "06:15", "out there right off the bat because I", "06:16", "think Iran right now is consuming so", "06:18", "much of the oxygen for people out there", "06:20", "so people thinking that the reason why", "06:22", "we're backing out of the deal is because", "06:24", "the president's being unreasonable and", "06:26", "we're forcing well you're saying it's a", "06:28", "shit deal period yeah I think the idea", "06:31", "that we have to stay in it because it's", "06:33", "better than the alternative and the", "06:35", "alternative you know being", "06:37", "war is is not framing it properly I", "06:41", "don't think that doesn't make any sense", "06:42", "to me but I think that the fact that the", "06:45", "UK the the the French the Germans have", "06:48", "all agreed publicly that it's an", "06:50", "inadequate deal it needs to be fixed", "06:52", "that tells you something but it also", "06:54", "tells you that they have real strong", "06:56", "financial incentives for continuing to", "06:58", "do business in Iran they as to Russia", "07:01", "and China frankly the other signatories", "07:03", "so you know and also here's the other", "07:06", "part I mean Trump you know what is it", "07:08", "now or 16 or 17 months into Trump's", "07:10", "administration so it's not like he got", "07:12", "into the White House and the next day he", "07:14", "you know he can the deal he's been", "07:16", "talking but nobody listens to anything", "07:18", "I'm not a supporter of Trump necessarily", "07:20", "I mean I want the government to work so", "07:21", "it's not that I'm supporting Trump", "07:23", "I support the guy I want the government", "07:24", "to work just like the previous", "07:25", "administration I wasn't a supporter of", "07:26", "Obama but hey I want it to work I want", "07:28", "good things to happen and in also he you", "07:31", "know he went out there and and there was", "07:32", "some talk about let's see if we can't", "07:34", "find some way to get rid of the sunset", "07:36", "clause some way to rein in their", "07:39", "ballistic missile development program", "07:41", "something way although it's not going to", "07:43", "happen to rein in all the the", "07:47", "shenanigans if you want to call it that", "07:49", "that they're engaged in the Middle East", "07:50", "and that didn't happen so I think he you", "07:54", "know took a step that is not as", "07:57", "god-awful as his critics would like us", "08:01", "to believe", "08:01", "well that isn't that that's a real", "08:03", "problem and it your phone's going off", "08:04", "over there little fella oh yeah I'm", "08:08", "gonna

"09:35", "early training we spent a long time", "09:38", "working maps and compass right you know", "09:40", "shooting azmuth and figuring out where", "09:42", "you're at and trying to fit and shooting", "09:44", "azmuth yeah you know well figuring out", "09:46", "yeah you're basically I don't know you", "09:48", "know sounds oversimplify this but you're", "09:50", "basically triangulating and figuring out", "09:52", "where you are at any given point in time", "09:53", "right I called azmuth yeah yeah it's", "09:56", "that is a very good question and not one", "09:58", "that I asked when I was in the outfit", "10:01", "that was one of those people that would", "10:03", "just accept things as they were told to", "10:04", "me", "10:04", "and that's why I got along so well I", "10:07", "never questioned anything which is an", "10:09", "interesting point I don't want to I", "10:10", "don't want to roam all over this place", "10:12", "but today was confirmation hearings for", "10:16", "Gina Haspel mm-hmm", "10:18", "and I I'll copy out this by saying I'm a", "10:20", "big supporter of hers I think she's an", "10:22", "outstanding choice for this she's the", "10:24", "new right the new director designate for", "10:27", "the CIA and so today she went up on", "10:29", "Capitol Hill I had open and then", "10:32", "subsequently a closed-door session with", "10:35", "the the senators and some of the", "10:39", "senators the reason I bring this up is", "10:40", "because a handful of the Senators we're", "10:43", "asking her and seemed focused on saying", "10:45", "well you know how but with this", "10:48", "rendition program the rendition and", "10:49", "interrogation program how did you feel", "10:52", "about it well you know morally what you", "10:56", "know did you many quandary what you know", "10:58", "we know that you you you you you know", "10:59", "the agency was doing what was allowed", "11:00", "within the Department of Justice because", "11:03", "the Office of Legal Counsel was too", "11:04", "correcting that from the Department of", "11:05", "Justice for that program all those years", "11:07", "ago and laws have subsequently changed", "11:10", "but at the time they didn't want to", "11:12", "necessarily talk about that cuz I don't", "11:14", "think they wanted to highlight the fact", "11:15", "that the DOJ had said this is you know", "11:17", "what is able to be done so instead they", "11:21", "focused on how did you feel and I I", "11:24", "guess the reason I bring it up is", "11:25", "because when I was in the outfit I'm not", "11:28", "a deep thinker right so I never stood", "11:30", "around and thought to myself how do I", "11:31", "feel about this on any given moment", "11:32", "right I mean no matter what we were", "11:34", "doing it never occurred to me to sit", "11:35", "there and question it you know as long", "11:37", "as it we knew what we were doing was", "11:39", "proper and legal and was pursuit of you", "11:41", "know tasking from from national security", "11:44", "concerns then yeah and I don't think you", "11:46", "want your military or your Intel service", "11:49", "I don't think you want everybody out", "11:50", "there at the pointy edge of the spear", "11:52", "you know saying well I'm gonna do things", "11:53", "based on how I feel about it in the", "11:55", "moment and it just seemed like a strange", "11:57", "line of questioning who was responsible", "12:01", "for that mm let me think they were", "12:03", "actually they were there were three or", "12:04", "four yeah Senator Reid and and so trying", "12:11", "to understand well so what they did then", "12:14", "was different than what is legal today", "12:15", "is that the case yes exactly so the DOJ", "12:19", "in after in the wake of 9/11 I mean", "12:22", "there's so much here I mean in the wake", "12:23", "of 9/11 you think about the context most", "12:26", "people have you know young people don't", "12:28", "even know what it feels like right I", "12:29", "mean they do know that they've and and", "12:30", "other people have forgotten or they just", "12:32", "tired of it all they don't want to think", "12:33", "about it but in the wake of 9/11 there", "12:36", "was a there was a feeling there was a", "12:39", "sense right that it was gonna happen", "12:41", "again and there certainly was evidence", "12:42", "and there was there was a very large", "12:45", "effort here to try to make sure that we", "12:47", "protected American lives", "12:50", "so the DOJ was issuing very clear", "12:54", "guidance on what could and could not be", "12:56", "done for the rendition and interrogation", "12:58", "program and that guidance was in you", "13:01", "know provided to the general counsel at", "13:02", "the agency that was then you know", "13:04", "disseminated to personnel out in the", "13:06", "field and tell tell people so the", "13:08", "fidgets listeners for the first time", "13:09", "what you used to do for the CIA so they", "13:11", "understand you're coming from a position", "13:12", "of you you actually understand this now", "13:14", "yeah I was I did in the Operations", "13:17", "Directorate so there", "13:18", "the agency is made up of essentially a", "13:20", "sage the name sometimes but four", "13:21", "directorates so you have operations you", "13:23", "have intelligence which is all the smart", "13:25", "people reports are officers who are", "13:27", "sorry the analysts you have science and", "13:29", "technology which is where they develop", "13:30", "all the amazing gear that comes out of", "13:32", "the agency a lot of which then ends up", "13:34", "in the commercial sector so if anybody", "13:36", "is walking around with a defibrillator", "13:37", "that battery technology came out of S&T", "13:40", "research drones satellite technology the", "13:44", "you to stealth program you to you know", "13:46", "plane was was developed out of and run", "13:49", "out of the agency so incredible things", "13:50", "that come out of there and then admin", "13:52", "but I was in the Operations Directorate", "13:55", "and worked on everything from", "13:56", "counter-narcotics operations to", "13:59", "counterinsurgency operations and and and", "14:02", "then obviously counterterrorism", "14:04", "operations so I guess the point is that", "14:09", "I mean there's something I'm not quite", "14:11", "sure how to explain it but there's an", "14:13", "interesting point that I think I've been", "14:14", "pondering which is that listening to the", "14:17", "hearing today and listening to the way", "14:19", "that the Senators the Democratic", "14:21", "senators who were looking to kind of", "14:23", "make this the key issue there's there's", "14:28", "a sense of we're not putting it in", "14:30", "context of the time and in the national", "14:33", "mood and that's a dangerous thing", "14:35", "because the laws were different than", "14:37", "they are now and they were different and", "14:39", "what that means is that because in the", "14:41", "wake of 9/11 and I don't want to say", "14:44", "that that values change but I think that", "14:48", "they do in the sense of what people are", "14:50", "willing to to do and whether you're", "14:53", "talking about", "14:53", "okay we're willing to have a rendition", "14:55", "interrogation program in the wake of", "14:56", "9/11", "14:57", "now we're not of course and so I think", "15:03", "it's anyway I think there's a there's a", "15:05", "danger to that line of questioning where", "15:07", "they kept talking about how how did it", "15:09", "how did you feel about it it's not you", "15:11", "you're they're mixing this and I'm not", "15:14", "eloquent enough to explain it but I", "15:16", "found it fascinating that that was a", "15:17", "question they wanted to focus on I think", "15:19", "there's a real danger to people or fur", "15:24", "people that don't have any experience in", "15:27", "actual war or really understand combat", "15:30", "or really understand", "15:31", "what can happen and what can go wrong in", "15:34", "talking about it with the same sort of", "15:37", "language that you would use to describe", "15:39", "office politics yes yes I they got to", "15:42", "see that's what I damnit that's what I", "15:44", "was trying to say you know how do you", "15:46", "feel how do you feel about this we don't", "15:48", "want a bad work environment should we", "15:49", "torture no we want to save lives but we", "15:52", "don't want this kind of feel bad we", "15:54", "don't want him to feel bad and I mean", "15:55", "look there was actually this this is", "15:57", "some people we're entertaining the idea", "15:58", "that you know Khalid Sheikh Mohammed", "16:00", "would come out and you know talk to the", "16:03", "Senators you know as you're going", "16:05", "through this confirmation process about", "16:07", "what feelings what Khalid Sheikh", "16:10", "Mohammed was a mastermind of 9/11 and he", "16:12", "actually requested yeah to talk about", "16:15", "her right and about about his guess I", "16:18", "just wanted to reflect on yeah the whole", "16:20", "the yeah you know from his perspective", "16:22", "and isn't he still locked up yeah he's", "16:25", "you want anima BAE yeah you know god", "16:27", "forbid he should rot in jail but you", "16:29", "know I think it's it's kind of where", "16:31", "we've it's sort of where we've come to", "16:33", "and I think in part again because", "16:34", "there's distance right there's too much", "16:35", "and so anyway she should again she", "16:40", "should be confirmed the the whole", "16:43", "rendition interrogation program was", "16:45", "reviewed at nauseam thousands of pages", "16:47", "written and interestingly enough a lot", "16:49", "of the people up there on the hill right", "16:50", "now in this confirmation process the", "16:52", "senators who are saying that they need", "16:54", "to know more but the same ones who were", "16:56", "there before so theoretically either", "16:58", "they didn't read all the material that", "16:59", "was given to them about this where", "17:01", "they'd forgotten it or their you know", "17:03", "this or in reality this is more about", "17:05", "Trump than it is about her hmm", "17:06", "which you know I don't want to be", "17:08", "shocking anyone by saying that perhaps", "17:10", "there's political grandstanding going on", "17:12", "but she is eminently qualified never", "17:15", "happened no I wouldn't happen up there", "17:16", "not in America maybe somewhere else not", "17:18", "here yeah so anyway you you you support", "17:21", "her you think she's an excellent choice", "17:22", "and look 707 operational tours several", "17:26", "management positions and I guess at the", "17:28", "end of the day it comes down to I would", "17:31", "rather have

was", "17:57", "not that long after 9/11 there was still", "18:00", "you know seven years later still", "18:02", "thoughts in people's mind about it well", "18:04", "interesting enough I mean that was in", "18:05", "2013 when he was confirmed but in 2009", "18:07", "he was they wanted to confirm it or they", "18:10", "wanted to bring him up as the appointee", "18:12", "for the director of the CIA for again it", "18:15", "would been President Obama's first term", "18:16", "but they decided not to because they for", "18:18", "the reason that they thought well maybe", "18:19", "it's too close to after thee and they", "18:21", "didn't want to go through the the", "18:22", "heartburn of having this process so", "18:24", "instead they brought him into the White", "18:26", "House he became

really", "19:25", "do that I don't I don't be glib you know", "19:28", "look they all sit on the committees they", "19:29", "theoretically are privy to all this", "19:31", "information there is a very

knew about it so", "20:03", "maybe those senators are asking her how", "20:05", "she feels about it now maybe they should", "20:07", "turn around look in the mirror and ask", "20:08", "themselves how they feel about it but", "20:09", "they're not gonna do that", "20:10", "so anyway that an enough said she's", "20:13", "eminently qualified should happen", "20:15", "because we got big issues we got

time", "23:10", "involved and they've they're very adept", "23:12", "at it they they throw an enormous amount", "23:15", "of resource out there into hoovering up", "23:16", "everything not just from

that's why", "23:39", "it's so important and so that's why", "23:41", "they're talking about Huawei because of", "23:43", "the potential for them to use their", "23:46", "their reach to further their

efforts to gather", "24:04", "information so that's that's sort of", "24:07", "yeah that was a wordy explanation no but", "24:10", "it makes sense and it's when I read it I", "24:13", "read a bunch of tech articles where", "24:15", "people were questioning whether or not", "24:17", "it's even possible for a while way to be", "24:19", "using those phones to spy on people but", "24:21", "then there was some other articles where", "24:23", "Huawei was being charged", "24:25", "with what was it again they were using", "24:27", "there was they were selling illegal", "24:29", "technology to Iran there was something", "24:32", "they were there breaking the sanctions I", "24:33", "think yeah they were there was no no", "24:38", "that couldn't yeah they were but is what", "24:43", "so they were they were selling things to", "24:45", "Iran and this was a big part of it that", "24:48", "they were what the tech people were", "24:50", "saying they were incredulous here Huawei", "24:52", "under is that you again you said Jesus", "24:56", "Christ I've turned this thing off you", "25:01", "don't have to do I would I would put it", "25:03", "on airplane mode but I don't have a clue", "25:09", "okay get your phone watches your watch", "25:13", "out and now it's I feel like Dick Tracy", "25:15", "it really does feel like Dick Tracy are", "25:17", "your kids the idea of talking on your", "25:19", "phone be so ridiculous like what that's", "25:21", "never take it off the password comes on", "25:29", "immediately oh really", "25:30", "no no that's a dial tone that's a that's", "25:32", "yeah Laurie okay right now people are", "25:37", "thinking really it's hilarious because", "25:45", "you're talking about technology and then", "25:48", "this happens", "25:49", "so we're talking about whether or not we", "25:50", "should be worried about Huawei and you", "25:51", "can't even figure out how to use your", "25:52", "fucker yeah that's that's perfectly", "25:55", "understand anybody that knows me knows", "25:56", "that that's the case because I mean and", "25:58", "and beckon to be fair back in the old", "25:59", "days that's again we had compasses and", "26:01", "maps yes you know but even when we", "26:03", "started developing new technology and", "26:05", "keira quite frankly if you got to go out", "26:08", "do anything the first thing you do is", "26:10", "throw everything away that's got a", "26:11", "battery on them right yeah and so we", "26:14", "weren't necessarily you dumb it down", "26:16", "because you assume something's gonna go", "26:17", "wrong and usually it does", "26:20", "and usually it's based on on kit on gear", "26:23", "and so yeah I never really became very", "26:26", "adept at it we've got a we've got a I", "26:28", "got a this three little boys scooter", "26:31", "Sluggo and Mugsy and and I got hilarious", "26:34", "names and their dere hilarious there's", "26:36", "great kids but we", "26:38", "we got a gaming system I'm trying to", "26:40", "remember what the hell xbox or", "26:42", "playstation xbox and say hey Xbox and", "26:46", "because my youngest Mugsy he's he's only", "26:49", "six and so he still says trill to", "26:51", "pronounce his words right so it's Xbox", "26:56", "I can't do it does it sound stupid what", "26:57", "I do when he does it's normally cute so", "26:59", "we got this thing and I'll sit there", "27:00", "with him and try to play like NBA 2k or", "27:02", "something and it just doesn't work it's", "27:05", "not intuitive to me right there's", "27:06", "nothing that's intuitive about its know", "27:08", "how to angle shit and press the right", "27:11", "button I know they're not they just", "27:13", "assume they're gonna get it you can", "27:14", "unlock hidden characters by moving the", "27:16", "joystick a funny way", "27:18", "yeah and Mugsy talks there LeBron James", "27:19", "directly apparently then communicated", "27:21", "through Xbox now so yeah so the detect", "27:25", "people that are skeptical what they're", "27:29", "saying is that if Huawei really did have", "27:31", "something in their phones that allowed", "27:33", "them to spy on people you'd be able to", "27:36", "find it and the tech guys would find it", "27:38", "do you buy that here here's what I would", "27:44", "say about that is that I'm sure there's", "27:48", "obviously a lot of very smart tech guys", "27:50", "and within diligence for all your", "27:52", "information and security needs we have", "27:54", "some very smart tech people but when", "27:57", "you're talking about the Chinese state", "27:59", "and the resources and capabilities that", "28:01", "that entails yes if you're if you're", "28:05", "saying that NSA could possibly detect", "28:07", "this but if you're talking about just", "28:08", "dispersing you know kid out into the", "28:10", "marketplace and the way that that thing", "28:12", "gets spread and disseminated and", "28:14", "inserted into companies and and then", "28:17", "potentially allows points of access into", "28:19", "these businesses and again it doesn't", "28:21", "matter it's not like they just have to", "28:22", "go after IBM or rate the honors I mean", "28:25", "they're going after everything because", "28:26", "it potentially is all of interest to", "28:28", "them so their idea is to just steal as", "28:31", "much technology and as much intellectual", "28:33", "property as they can and recreate it", "28:35", "over in China that has been the plan I", "28:37", "don't want to keep you know I don't want", "28:38", "to you know demonize an entire nation", "28:40", "right exactly but they have proven", "28:42", "themselves enormous ly adept at doing", "28:44", "this and they've they and not that", "28:47", "others don't Russia does the same thing", "28:49", "all variety of others you know they", "28:51", "even you know a lot of our hours", "28:52", "everybody if to the degree that they", "28:54", "have the resources and the motivation", "28:56", "and they consider it an issue related", "28:58", "national security whatever it might be", "28:59", "they're willing to do it they're willing", "29:01", "to try so it is it is interesting but", "29:05", "yeah the hallway thing in the ZTE again", "29:07", "I I think the the rollout of that", "29:09", "concern in there the rollout of sort of", "29:11", "trying to provide guidance has been a", "29:13", "little clumsy mmm so one one thing that", "29:18", "was speculation was that people didn't", "29:20", "have to worry about the phones but what", "29:21", "essentially they're trying to do is", "29:23", "cripple the company financially and not", "29:25", "allow them to get a foothold in America", "29:27", "because they're the third largest", "29:29", "cellphone manufacturer in the world", "29:31", "number one Apple number two Samsung", "29:33", "they're number three but in America no", "29:36", "one knows who they are and so the idea", "29:38", "is what they're trying to do is make", "29:39", "sure that the Chinese government doesn't", "29:41", "get a foothold in this company in this", "29:43", "country where those companies or Huawei", "29:45", "the company Huawei becomes a popular", "29:48", "brand for people to buy and that would", "29:51", "allow them even if they didn't have any", "29:52", "spy device on this phone it would allow", "29:54", "them to get other devices into people's", "29:57", "homes that could potentially spy on them", "29:59", "and then more importantly get into", "30:01", "companies right and spy on the companies", "30:03", "and this is one of the pieces of", "30:04", "speculations that I read about was that", "30:06", "they had certain servers that were", "30:08", "sending an exorbitant amount of", "30:10", "information out and they were trying to", "30:13", "figure out what was going on with them", "30:15", "and that there was like an excessive", "30:16", "amount of information that was leaked", "30:18", "data that was leaving the servers versus", "30:21", "coming in and they're like this really", "30:23", "seems like some fucked up shit going on", "30:25", "this right Huawei first of all Huawei is", "30:28", "already present here in the country they", "30:30", "manufacture a lot of things besides", "30:31", "phones and so they've already got of a", "30:33", "pretty big footprint in this country and", "30:36", "and with our allies as well so I mean I", "30:40", "think it's smart to consider the the", "30:45", "nature of a particular regime or", "30:48", "government you know when you're talking", "30:51", "about the potential for their products", "30:53", "to enter into the commercial sector", "30:57", "where they may have access because if if", "31:01", "they've shown a pattern of activity for", "31:04", "a", "31:04", "hiring intellectual property which is", "31:06", "again a very delicate way to put it then", "31:09", "I don't think it's a stretch to say we", "31:11", "should be concerned by their efforts to", "31:14", "put communications gear even if it seems", "31:17", "pedestrian at the outset into the", "31:21", "marketplace so I I'm not sure that I'm", "31:23", "buying the idea that it's some nefarious", "31:26", "plan to shut out Huawei so that they", "31:28", "don't get a foothold in the phone", "31:30", "business no and I say that because I've", "31:35", "been you know thirty years I've been you", "31:36", "know dealing with the Chinese in terms", "31:38", "of their efforts to acquire information", "31:42", "both in the government and commercial", "31:43", "side of things so I come at it from a", "31:47", "very cynical point of view much like I", "31:49", "do with the Iranian issue and and the", "31:51", "likelihood that they have not been", "31:53", "living up to you know their their part", "31:55", "of the bargain and people will say well", "31:58", "again I go back to the same thing we've", "32:00", "been inspecting and they've been", "32:01", "complying with all of that well yeah you", "32:03", "know this limited amount of inspection", "32:05", "that we have to their civilian sites", "32:07", "there's no it's it's it's not a secret", "32:09", "you know at this point it shouldn't be a", "32:11", "secret that again we have no access to", "32:13", "their military facilities so I tend to", "32:16", "look at things in that view and I and I", "32:18", "if I see a pattern of activity I'm very", "32:22", "reluctant to think there's somehow going", "32:23", "to stop that pattern of activity for", "32:25", "whatever reason", "32:26", "so again North Korea same thing the", "32:28", "problem with all of this North Korea", "32:29", "Iran Syria and chemical weapons the", "32:31", "problem with all of that I realize I'm", "32:32", "kind of jumping around I've just", "32:34", "hallways over here but is the", "32:38", "verification issue it's always the the", "32:40", "weak link in any type of agreement", "32:42",

it", "44:19", "anymore they didn't need the Intel", "44:21", "service because", "44:21", "we won the war and things are gonna be", "44:23", "looking pretty good well about a year", "44:25", "later you know they they got the band", "44:28", "back together because what was happening", "44:30", "and the Soviets were running you know", "44:32", "all over the place and and it was the", "44:34", "Cold War and the Soviets had no", "44:36", "intention of being benign and living in", "44:39", "a community of nations and so suddenly", "44:41", "they got the band back and said let's", "44:43", "okay so

are pretty", "45:29", "goddamn good for the most part yeah and", "45:31", "I think that's part of the problem is", "45:32", "that these people they're not traveling", "45:34", "to these war zones

we make mistakes", "46:38", "there's no doubt about it but we tend to", "46:40", "course-correct we try sometimes it takes", "46:42", "a little bit longer we no matter what", "46:45", "administrations there we try to do the", "46:47", "right thing and so when people talk", "46:50", "about you know us just stepping off and", "46:52", "and and not worrying about our place in", "46:54", "the world you know someone's going to", "46:57", "try to take that position on the ladder", "46:59", "and it's not going to be as benign as we", "47:02", "tend to be not always again again I", "47:04", "realize we make mistakes I find ok", "47:06", "flying I'm not gonna sell flagellate", "47:08", "over it but you know still we do a", "47:10", "pretty damn good job we tried to be the", "47:12", "moral authority

"56:45", "they don't operate under any laws and", "56:47", "which is what Gina Haspel said she", "56:48", "handled the question very well and kind", "56:50", "of shut it down but this idea that", "56:53", "sometimes you'll bump into that where", "56:55", "people I don't know what it is I'd the", "56:59", "they're apologists they wanted to act as", "57:02", "if we're the bad guys and and anyway", "57:04", "yeah yeah what am I know that's exactly", "57:06", "what it is right I was about to say what", "57:07", "do I know but that is exactly what it is", "57:12", "it's like there's apologists and they're", "57:15", "also trying to frame a narrative instead", "57:17", "of trying to understand the situation", "57:19", "objectively instead of really asking", "57:22", "someone who was there asking a bunch of", "57:24", "people who were there getting a sense of", "57:26", "what was the climate what was going on", "57:28", "what actually happened instead they're", "57:31",

"57:38", "Brown", "57:39", "points yeah yeah no I think that's true", "57:41", "I think this there's so little and it's", "57:43", "obviously much worse right now with it", "57:44", "with the current administration the", "57:45", "president Trump it just seems like", "57:48", "nobody I mean it's like World War one", "57:51", "right everybody's in their trenches", "57:52", "throwing hand grenades each other", "57:53", "nobody's in the middle ground nobody's", "57:55", "even trying to get up and go into the", "57:56", "middle ground and so nobody's having", "57:58", "those conversations like you said where", "58:00", "they they even make a lame attempt to", "58:03", "try to understand what the other", "58:04", "perspective might be you know and in", "58:07", "particular it's exhausting in the sense", "58:11", "that not everything that this", "58:13", "administration again you know the caveat", "58:15", "be I didn't vote for Trump I didn't vote", "58:17", "for Clinton you know we got

something but I", "58:38", "you know that I defecate I'd be the only", "58:39", "person so I didn't I didn't vote I", "58:42", "couldn't I couldn't figure out how we", "58:44", "got to that point hmm", "58:46", "and yeah the one person who should", "58:48", "really be pissed off was Bernie Sanders", "58:50", "I mean the only collusion we've really", "58:51", "proven up to this point yeah is that the", "58:53", "ID C colluding to keep Bernie down and", "58:55", "people sweep that under the rug so quick", "58:57", "it's so adorable it's adorable how", "59:01", "people just make it like that's not a", "59:03", "big deal that the deleting of 30,000", "59:07", "emails not a big deal collusion with the", "59:09", "DNC to rig the primaries not a big deal", "59:13", "yeah and Bernie god blessed me played", "59:15", "the good soldier and you know fell on", "59:17", "the sword and has it really well he", "59:19", "hasn't made much of an issue of it I", "59:20", "think it's because he has aspirations to", "59:22", "move forward and he knows they own one", "59:24", "now and he knows that Hillary Clinton is", "59:25", "essentially done that's interesting what", "59:27", "if they try to bring her back in 2020", "59:30", "people go fucking crazy she might", "59:35", "actually be thinking that well I'm sure", "59:37", "she what yeah they probably got on a", "59:39", "vitamin IV drip

they over there", "77:52", "imprisoned for mmm well one of them one", "77:55", "of them was a businessman and he was", "77:57", "serving 10 years hard labor imagine hard", "78:00", "labor camp in North Korea for supposedly", "78:03", "for espionage he's a business guy and", "78:05", "they don't care I mean they've done this", "78:07", "numerous times in the past it really", "78:09", "doesn't matter if you show up and you're", "78:10", "in business", "78:11", "the other two were also interesting they", "78:13", "were academics they were at the", "78:16", "Pyongyang University for science

same thing", "78:58", "supposedly engaged in espionage and so", "79:01", "they got chucked in so we'll see I mean", "79:04", "I you know whether whether we're able to", "79:06", "get anything from this who knows but", "79:08", "that's a good sign the fact that he met", "79:10", "with as you pointed out president moon", "79:12", "from South Korea a very good sign", "79:14", "the Chinese have they sent their foreign", "79:16", "minister over to gongyang a couple weeks", "79:19", "ago first time for ministers been over", "79:21", "there and maybe 11 years 12 years Wow so", "79:24", "they understand the importance of this", "79:26", "and I think everybody's the dynamic is", "79:29", "shifted because I think you know we've", "79:31", "kicked the can down the road for so long", "79:32", "that they're basically at the point", "79:35", "where their programs or you don't close", "79:37", "to being fully developed and I think", "79:39", "that you know the Chinese understand", "79:41", "that that means that all those other", "79:42", "options perhaps of kicking the can down", "79:44", "the road", "79:45", "aren't on the decision tree anymore and", "79:47", "so you know we they don't want chaos on", "79:49", "the peninsula", "79:50", "they don't want military conflict nobody", "79:52", "does and so I think the Chinese for", "79:54", "basically the first time have been", "79:55", "aggressively assisting with the", "79:57", "sanctions that were put in place mmm", "79:59", "that had a very quick response on Kim", "80:01", "jong-un he's not suicidal he just wants", "80:03", "to survive in position of leadership", "80:05", "right so he's looking at it thinking", "80:07", "okay the calculus has changed so I gotta", "80:09", "do something different and again you", "80:11", "know being pragmatic maybe it doesn't", "80:13", "work but at least we're trying and I", "80:15", "think that's a good thing no", "80:16", "unquestionably it's a good thing and", "80:18", "also the video that North Korean soldier", "80:21", "fleeing and getting shot shot at as he", "80:25", "escapes North Korea I mean that had to", "80:27", "get to North Korea too and they realized", "80:29", "like Jesus Christ is a second guy and", "80:31", "how many months that was fleeing like", "80:34", "that and and got away and they're", "80:35", "finding parasites in their body and yeah", "80:38", "extreme malnourished and this is a", "80:41", "soldier so you got to think everybody", "80:43", "over there is probably in an entire", "80:45", "straight right and I've talked about", "80:47", "this in terms of just just a simple if", "80:48", "not simple but the idea that you know", "80:51", "the population in terms of its physical", "80:52", "stature compared to the South Koreans is", "80:54", "you know they're shorter they're there", "80:57", "and that's a malnutrition issue I think", "81:00", "also I think they've realized that", "81:01", "there's only so much they can do going", "81:04", "forward to lock the place down right and", "81:07", "technology at some point even though", "81:08", "it's North Korea and there's not a lot", "81:10", "there there's enough and I think there's", "81:12", "a sense that they you know how long", "81:14", "thinking they can control the population", "81:16", "the way they have so again he's not the", "81:18", "Kim is not suicidal he wants to maintain", "81:22", "power when you think about every country", "81:24", "action its own best interest or every", "81:25", "leader acts in their own best interest", "81:27", "that's his thought process and and how", "81:29", "do I do that well okay you know maybe so", "81:33", "I think that you know it could happen we", "81:35", "could get something really good out of", "81:36", "this we'll see you know but the Iranians", "81:39", "are watching it and North Koreans are", "81:40", "watching what we did over there Ron I", "81:42", "disagree that's that whole notion that", "81:44", "North Koreans are gonna look at it and", "81:46", "go that means we can't trust him look if", "81:48", "President Obama was so enamored with", "81:50", "that that deal that he made with the", "81:52", "Iranians well then take it to the Senate", "81:53", "right yeah get it make it a treaty you", "81:58", "made an agreement an executive order", "82:00", "basically and so you know they're not", "82:04", "looking I don't think the North Koreans", "82:05", "are looking at this and going Trump is", "82:07", "going back on his word I think they're", "82:08", "looking at going Trump's okay he means", "82:10", "that he's not gonna put up with a bad", "82:12", "deal mm and this wasn't that good a deal", "82:15", "so I think that's the way that they", "82:17", "would process it and and we'll see but", "82:20", "you know who knows where the Iranians", "82:21", "gonna go with what they're doing and", "82:22", "people right now listening for ever", "82:24", "thinking okay I'm tired of listen about", "82:25", "the Iranians well that seems to be", "82:27", "something you're really concerned about", "82:29", "well I think only because you know if", "82:32", "it's if it's not handled properly and", "82:33", "there's a lot of moving parts meeting", "82:35", "our allies meaning the wild card of what", "82:37", "rouhani and the regime is going to do", "82:39", "but look make no mistake there's no", "82:40", "there's no this idea that somehow they", "82:42", "this was in a moderate Iranian regime", "82:45", "all you gotta do is look at what they're", "82:46", "engaged in doing in in the Lebanon in", "82:48", "Yemen in a proxy war with with the", "82:51", "Saudis and others in Iraq and Syria in", "82:54", "in the work that they're doing and all", "82:56", "the soldiers a US
