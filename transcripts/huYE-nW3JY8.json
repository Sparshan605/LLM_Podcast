"60:25", "business don't be any feeling yeah don't", "60:27", "be in your feelings well like you know", "60:31", "one of the more interesting things about", "60:33", "the PFL this season was Vinny Magalhaes", "60:35", "like Vinny Magalhaes has become who I", "60:39", "thought he would be earlier in his", "60:41", "career because he's such a phenom with", "60:43", "grappling I mean he's he's the", "60:44", "legitimate world champion I mean I", "60:47", "remember watching him through a flying", "60:50", "armbar unpaid upon Oh who's a multiple", "60:53", "time Brazilian Jiu Jitsu world champion", "60:55", "himself and Vinny just locks him up and", "60:57", "jumps into a flying armbar I'm like that", "60:59", "is crazy and finished him off I was like", "61:02", "that is insane like that's how good", "61:04", "Vinny is and he was catching people and", "61:07", "and I thought he was on his way and", "61:08", "Shawn what is his last name Sean", "61:10", "O'Connell yeah I want to see him Ally", "61:12", "but I know that song's name Sean", "61:13", "O'Connell I was very impressed man", "61:15", "amazed that he was able to beat him man", "61:17", "he put he put a real good game plan", "61:18", "together he had Jeremy horn in his", "61:20", "corner too huh I have been having that", "61:22", "knowledge yeah thank behind you you know", "61:24", "what I mean but um like Vinny I think", "61:27", "his fights lasted like not even around", "61:29", "to get into the get to the finals you", "61:32", "know so that's four fights and he hasn't", "61:33", "even spent five minutes in the cage yet", "61:34", "you know and then", "61:36", "Shawn takes him to the end but then this", "61:39", "season Vinny just fought a couple of", "61:41", "weeks ago and man the I guess is kind of", "61:46", "like the strategy to be Vinny of course", "61:47", "is to keep the fight standing not get", "61:50", "taken out not be on bottom don't even", "61:52", "let him pull guard but he took he took", "61:54", "he took a pounding in that first round", "61:56", "he needs he needs a win he needs like he", "61:58", "needs to show that that Vinny level", "62:00", "jujitsu his next fight to get into the", "62:02", "playoffs this year", "62:03", "did he win his fight he lost he lost", "62:05", "stopped in the second I believe but who", "62:08", "emiliana Saudi oh he lit him up man", "62:11", "really he just just picked him apart", "62:14", "stayed on the outside", "62:15", "I think Vinny did get land one takedown", "62:17", "but Saudi defended got back to his feet", "62:20", "many like he just worked their body head", "62:22", "just really good boxing yeah then you", "62:24", "might be just that guy that's this elite", "62:26", "level jujitsu guy that never quite", "62:28", "realizes his full potential in MMA you", "62:31", "know and it's also like the amount of", "62:33", "time you got to think he was back in the", "62:34", "Ultimate Fighter or Ryan Bader stopped", "62:37", "him in the finals that's a long time ago", "62:40", "like the third or fourth or fifth season", "62:42", "something like that", "62:43", "so was that 2007 or something like that", "62:45", "12 years ago that's a long career it's a", "62:47", "long time but like he still looks good", "62:50", "he still has his his striking has gotten", "62:52", "better I mean he's not going to be able", "62:55", "to go toe-to-toe with the elite level", "62:56", "strikers in his weight class but um his", "62:59", "wrestling is where I think that's where", "63:01", "he really needs to focus now if he still", "63:03", "wants to do I or how much long he wants", "63:05", "to do this because you know I think", "63:08", "Vinny's 30 33 34 35 was close but um but", "63:14", "his striking is you have to respect it", "63:17", "you have to respect his standing and if", "63:19", "he could transition to taking a shot off", "63:21", "of that and just chain wrestle like", "63:23", "that'll be so much better because on top", "63:26", "of course you know you know he's gonna", "63:28", "be a monster but if he's pulling guard", "63:30", "there's a few guys he's gonna catch but", "63:33", "most most of the better guys you're", "63:35", "gonna have a problem there what you", "63:36", "think - the birthday today 35 oh yeah", "63:40", "he's so one of the few guys I mean he", "63:42", "didn't get like two Kimora's in a row to", "63:45", "come Wars on the same night did it", "63:46", "really yeah this one throat fighting the", "63:49", "same night", "63:49", "that shit's crazy I'm not a fan of that", "63:51", "why cuz I think that the problem is say", "63:54", "if two guys fight right and one guy", "63:57", "knocks the other guy out real quick and", "63:59", "then goes into the next round but the", "64:02", "other guy who is going to fight he he", "64:05", "fights and he has a rough three round", "64:08", "war and then he goes into the next fight", "64:11", "one guy is super fresh and the other", "64:13", "guys bodies beat to shit just doesn't", "64:16", "doesn't make sense like one guy's legs", "64:18", "are all fucked up he's been leg kicked", "64:19", "he might have got dinged he might be", "64:21", "like a little dizzy and then he's gonna", "64:23", "go and fight an hour later that seems", "64:26", "ridiculous to me but what about like", "64:28", "does that so that's different for you if", "64:30", "it's wrestling or if it's um a", "64:31", "submission grappling talk yes because", "64:34", "there's no striking yeah because no", "64:35", "strike the thing about that is you can", "64:39", "always if you're going in banged up", "64:41", "right or if you get hurt we saw that", "64:43", "last year in the playoffs um I forget", "64:45", "who were they I believe it was um", "64:48", "mama dog know is not mama Dolph right he", "64:51", "won his fight but he I don't remember", "64:54", "what the injury was but he pulled out", "64:56", "you know and the guy he beat who was not", "64:59", "banged up really I mean the fight was a", "65:00", "tough fight", "65:01", "I mean claimed he was it he was going in", "65:03", "at a hundred percent and except for the", "65:05", "conditioning mmm yeah but the thing is", "65:08", "like there's a difference in being", "65:11", "injured like you tear your ACL and you", "65:13", "know it and like I can't fight I can't", "65:15", "go on and just being beat to shit that's", "65:18", "that's that is the difference but you", "65:20", "know like I mean what's the difference", "65:22", "between fight you you can only

these guys that you", "133:24", "have this look on their face like what", "133:25", "is this this is a new experience this is", "133:28", "a different kind of grappling and he", "133:30", "mobilizes people yeah like he gets you", "133:32", "in positions that like you literally you", "133:36", "can't go left you can't go right you", "133:38", "know he's got that wrist wrap on the", "133:40",

on the ground not", "134:00", "allowing could be to get around his body", "134:01", "and just just get back to his feet if he", "134:05", "gets taken down and I mean you we saw", "134:08", "some of the we know that could be not", "134:11", "the greatest striker you know we saw I", "134:15", "like went to do some do some damage on", "134:18", "the feet and I think the third or fourth", "134:20",

hey", "134:36", "listen", "134:36", "I also think Dustin is more of a", "134:40", "predator like he's like I think I like", "134:43", "when tis good on his feet he's boxing", "134:46", "solid he hits hard but I think just", "134:49", "Dustin's boxing IQ like if he hurts you", "134:52", "especially now I think if he hurts you", "134:54", "he's smarter about being able to finish", "134:57", "on what the power that he carries he's", "134:59", "more selective with his weapons mmm", "135:02", "so like that that's definitely a big", "135:05", "option if he if he can show that he", "135:08", "could hurt khabib standing then he has a", "135:10", "very good shot of stopping him there but", "135:12", "what does that mean to stop could be", "135:14", "like you know I mean like not is it", "135:17", "possible I think but you know what I", "135:20", "think you have to because like how do", "135:22", "you beat that wrestling over 25 minutes", "135:24", "right how do you keep him from taking",
