want or for", "140:32", "years I told myself and I think this was", "140:35", "certainly like the view of lots of", "140:38", "experts but what Palestinian nationalism", "140:40", "really wanted was a Palestinian state", "140:43", "Palestinian just want self-determination", "140:45", "like everyone else in the world and I am", "140:47", "absolutely on board with that the", "140:49", "problem is is that their leaders and", "140:52", "then you look at some of these polls and", "140:53", "the numbers are really disturbing and", "140:55", "they say no the goal is not having our", "140:58", "own state alongside Israel the goal is", "141:00", "erasing Israel the goal is for Israel", "141:04", "not to be there right and then you look", "141:06", "at the evidence of all of these peace", "141:08", "offers that were you know Oslo and Camp", "141:10", "David and we can go on and on and they", "141:12", "were all rejected so it's like is the", "141:14", "goal your own land and having a place of", "141:17", "your own or is the national or have we", "141:19", "told ourselves and I include myself in", "141:22", "this a lie about what Palestinian", "141:24", "nationalism or at least parts of it seek", "141:26", "and that's really really upsetting to", "141:28", "confront so the hard core position from", "141:32", "people like from Hezbollah is that", "141:36", "Israel is stolen yes Palestinian people", "141:40", "yes yeah and so but Hezbollah remembers", "141:45", "in southern Lebanon yeah right that's", "141:47", "like you know but they're all Iranian", "141:48", "proxies and Hamas oh yeah", "141:51", "Hezbollah all these they're all Iranian", "141:54", "proxies Hezbollah is in Iranian proxies", "141:56", "yeah and Hamas as well right mm-hmm and", "141:59", "they're all their position is that", "142:01", "Israel shouldn't exist oh absolutely", "142:04", "they do not want any", "142:06", "which state between the Jordan River and", "142:08", "the Mediterranean Sea they believe that", "142:10", "any Jewish presence in the Middle East", "142:12", "is heretical and that's what they", "142:15", "believe that's probably also accentuated", "142:20", "by our support for Israel all right", "142:22", "because the United States is fully in", "142:24", "support of Israel militarily politically", "142:27", "socially I mean that's like saying you", "142:32", "know I'm trying to think of the right", "142:37", "analogy here I mean they're they're not", "142:41", "like these are these are terrorist", "142:44", "groups", "142:44", "unless you think terror like terrorism", "142:46", "is rational I don't think that anything", "142:49", "is accentuated by like I think they", "142:51", "would think that about Israel whether or", "142:52", "not the US was supporting Israel yeah", "142:56", "when you see a situation like that where", "142:59", "there doesn't seem to be a solution", "143:01", "mm-hmm it's well the solution is", "143:04", "shrinking the conflict as much as", "143:06", "possible right I do not believe right", "143:08", "now you can resolve the conflict because", "143:11", "Israelis who have lived through times", "143:15", "where it was normal for buses and cafes", "143:17", "to just blow up you know the number of", "143:19", "people I know who were touched by the", "143:21", "Second Intifada like I was there during", "143:23", "times where you know a cafe would just", "143:26", "blow up down the street so like they", "143:28", "have been thoroughly disabused of the", "143:31", "idea that I think I think that many of", "143:34", "them have given up on the idea that", "143:35", "there could be peace in the short term", "143:37", "so what can you do right now to make", "143:39", "things a little bit better you can", "143:41", "improve economic life for people for", "143:44", "Palestinians living in the West Bank and", "143:46", "you can try and shrink the conflict", "143:48", "meaning no settlement expansion and I", "143:51", "would say pull out of some of these", "143:52", "settled Jewish settlements that are like", "143:54", "you know far-flung and that the Israeli", "143:57", "army is sort of protecting for no reason", "144:01", "but I think that's the best case", "144:03", "scenario for right now for Rome there's", "144:05", "a there's a book I think it's called on", "144:07", "catch 67 by Mika Goodman that I would", "144:10", "recommend to people that's about how to", "144:12", "shrink the conflict and that for now", "144:14", "being the best-case scenario but again", "144:17", "it's like why does you have to ask", "144:19", "yourself like why does", "144:20", "in the world obsessed about this", "144:22", "particular conflict yeah there's a weird", "144:26", "obsession with it why do you think that", "144:28", "is I think it's inescapable that part of", "144:32", "it is an obsession with the Jews like", "144:35", "there are 500,000 Palestinians living in", "144:38", "Lebanon most of whom live in refugee", "144:40", "camps and by official Lebanese law are", "144:44", "barred from being lawyers from being", "144:46", "doctors for being accountants it's a", "144:49", "horrible situation do you think most", "144:51", "people in the world know about the", "144:53", "situation of the Palestinian image", "144:55", "duration in Lebanon they don't even know", "144:58", "Palestinians are are in Lebanon or in", "145:00", "Jordan they've no idea the reason is", "145:03", "because you know it's like Palestinian", "145:06", "lives matter when the people that are", "145:09", "hurting them are Jews they don't seem to", "145:10", "matter when the people that are hurting", "145:12", "them are other Arabs that's one of the", "145:16", "things that I wanted to talk to you", "145:18", "about it's that this acceptance of", "145:21", "anti-semitism almost globally is unique", "145:26", "it's not it's a it's a weird racism or a", "145:31", "weird discrimination oh it's weird it", "145:37", "doesn't it doesn't parallel with any", "145:40", "other sort of discrimination right it's", "145:42", "like people aren't sitting around", "145:44", "thinking about how you know left-handed", "145:47", "people or Koreans are uniquely evil like", "145:50", "they're sitting around thinking about", "145:51", "that with regard to the Jews there's", "145:54", "going to be a certain amount of", "145:55", "population a certain percentage of the", "145:56", "population no matter what that's gonna", "145:58", "hold those beliefs and these have been", "146:00", "passed down for thousands of years yes", "146:03", "and the challenge is to keep society as", "146:08", "like healthy as possible to keep those", "146:13", "forces at bay really I mean it's it's", "146:18", "really it's unbelievable the extent to", "146:21", "which it's it's become accepted like", "146:24", "I'll give you an example like there was", "146:27", "um and this is the way that anti-zionism", "146:30", "presents itself the anti-zionism i think", "146:32", "is the modern form one of the", "146:34", "modern forms of anti-semitism because", "146:36", "what else do you call a movement that", "146:38", "says that the Jewish state that already", "146:41", "exists does not have a right to exist", "146:43", "like that sounds like oh that's like a", "146:47", "cool theory but it's like it exists they", "146:50", "live there they are surrounded by people", "146:52", "that want to murder them so what are you", "146:54", "suggesting that it just like goes away", "146:57", "like the effect of it would be nothing", "147:00", "less than unbelievable bloodshed and yet", "147:02", "lots of people in this world are going", "147:04", "around Saint calling themselves anti", "147:06", "Zionist do you think that they've it", "147:10", "seems like almost a sentiment that gets", "147:13", "expressed that hasn't been really", "147:15", "examined yes so it's a criticism of", "147:20", "Israel like people should be Israeli", "147:22", "government is full of like lunatics just", "147:25", "like our government just like any other", "147:27", "normal country but it's like Israel's", "147:29", "not treated like a normal country it's", "147:31", "treated in a way like this has these", "147:34", "superpowers both superpowers to like", "147:37", "effect peace in the Middle East and", "147:39", "superpowers to like like a supervillain", "147:42", "it's both at once", "147:44", "people hate a country that doesn't exist", "147:46", "and they love a country that doesn't", "147:48", "exist they project themselves and their", "147:50", "ideas of things on to this place and", "147:53", "it's just like a normal country that's", "147:55", "where it's it's so strange because", "147:58", "that's where there really doesn't seem", "148:00", "to be a way out of this because it's an", "148:04", "idea that's now that hasn't been fully", "148:06", "explored but has been expressed so", "148:09", "frivolously almost mm-hmm well it's just", "148:12", "it's like if you think about think about", "148:15", "if there was a movement in the world", "148:18", "that suggested that you know the", "148:20", "Japanese weren't a real people and the", "148:22", "in Japan does not have a right to exist", "148:24", "like think about how crazy that sounds", "148:26", "right but that's a normal thing that a", "148:28", "lot of people believe a lot of people", "148:30", "that you and I know why did you write", "148:32", "the book well what was what was your", "148:34", "goal like when you when you sat down you", "148:37", "decided you're gonna write this book how", "148:38", "to fight anti-semitism what what were", "148:41", "you thinking well first of all I wrote I", "148:43", "was supposed to write another book that", "148:44", "I'm still on the hook for I went and", "148:46", "begged a publisher to do", "148:47", "because after Pittsburgh I just kind of", "148:50", "couldn't stop saying it everywhere I", "148:51", "looked um", "148:53", "and honestly like yeah I think a", "148:56", "Pittsburgh hadn't happened I wouldn't", "148:57", "have written this first but I just", "148:59", "became so passionate about it and so", "149:03", "passionate about here's I think maybe", "149:07", "the shortest answer for this when we", "149:11", "talk about anti-semitism even you and I", "149:12", "like we think about Jews like the Jews", "149:15", "on the streets of Brooklyn or in", "149:16", "Pittsburgh or in that synagogue in", "149:18", "California as being the victims of it", "149:20", "but the act and they are but the real", "149:23", "bigger victim of it is the surrounding", "149:25", "society like when anti-semitism shows", "149:30", "itself in a culture it means that that", "149:32", "culture is extremely broken or in some", "149:36", "stage of death and the reason that I", "149:39", "think it's so important and the reason I", "149:41", "ultimately wrote the book is I want", "149:43", "people to understand that the fact that", "149:45", "anti-semitism is rising in America says", "149:48", "nothing about Jews it says everything", "149:50", "about America and where we are right now", "149:52", "like we don't want to be come a place", "149:55", "where anti-semitism is normalized", "149:58", "because guess what societies were", "150:00", "anti-semitism become normalized or", "150:02", "societies that no longer exist on the", "150:03", "face of the earth", "150:04", "I like how you described in your book as", "150:08", "a symptom like that we all have certain", "150:13", "bacteria or we all have certain viruses", "150:15", "but our immune system keeps them at bay", "150:17", "when those viruses show themselves it's", "150:20", "a it's a sign that the immune system is", "150:23", "weak that the body itself is weak yes", "150:25", "that's exactly right", "150:27", "couldn't said it better that's all I", "150:29", "said yeah I think that's true and the", "150:32", "question right is how do we rebuild back", "150:34", "our immune system and one of the reasons", "150:36", "that I'm alarmed by and I completely", "150:40", "understand the populist moment but I'm", "150:42", "also scared of it because populism often", "150:46", "does not end well for Jews or for the", "150:50", "political center and I think one one of", "150:52", "the reasons that we need to like how do", "150:54", "we rebuild our immune system like those", "150:56", "are the sort of things that I suggest in", "150:57", "the last chapter of the book and I think", "151:01", "I just I just hope we can do them", "151:03", "because I'm really really alarmed that", "151:07", "we're living in an America in 2020 where", "151:10", "people I know you know who wear a Jewish", "151:13", "star like put it inside their shirt when", "151:15", "they walk down the street that's crazy", "151:17", "mmm like that's crazy to me imagine if", "151:21", "that was a crucifix exactly and fear", "151:23", "yeah I mean to say nothing by the way of", "151:25", "like Jews in France that have you know", "151:28", "they've been hiding themselves for a", "151:31", "very very long
