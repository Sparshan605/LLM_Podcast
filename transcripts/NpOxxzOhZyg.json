I", "00:12", "said just don't say another word let's", "00:14", "start talking about this on the podcast", "00:15", "because this it kind of it's interesting", "00:18", "I started your book which I very rarely", "00:20", "read books I mostly do audiobooks but I", "00:24", "was forced to read yours but one of the", "00:27", "things that I found interesting is the", "00:29", "concept of what is natural and I've gone", "00:32", "over this many times myself I'm like", "00:34", "poisons natural like everything's", "00:36", "natural computers are natural really", "00:38", "because they come from the ground", "00:39", "they're made by people they're", "00:40", "essentially like you know a human's", "00:42", "version of anything like a bird would", "00:45", "create right Birds create birds nests or", "00:48", "those natural but this pie right this is", "00:51", "a pirate right yep which is fool's gold", "00:53", "right fool's gold", "00:55", "but it's naturally in these cubes in", "00:58", "these this this square form that's", "01:01", "perfect these perfect angles which you", "01:03", "would never believe you would think", "01:05", "somebody left this shit there I didn't",

can", "01:14", "just get the cubes they're just the cube", "01:16", "but they call the rock that it's in the", "01:18", "matrix which i think is kind of", "01:20", "appropriate that is going to have a", "01:21", "permanent spot on this desk with all", "01:23", "this other craziness here thank you so", "01:25", "much was really cool I did not know that", "01:26", "it came like that I found pyrite

that pyrite takes I'm kind of", "01:48", "obsessed with weird rocks but they look", "01:50", "just like sand dollars but they're gold", "01:53", "okay look like they're golden and so", "01:54", "these are you know I think one of the", "01:56", "things I actually changed my mind over", "01:58", "writing it like over the course of", "01:59", "writing this book oh there they are", "02:00", "Jaime pull-ups yeah they're incredible", "02:02", "right what it what causes it to take on", "02:05", "these different completely unusual forms", "02:08", "so I tried I tried to find others like a", "02:10", "local rock store where I live and I", "02:12", "asked the guy", "02:13", "apparently I don't understand how it", "02:15", "works at all but the way all crystals", "02:16", "work is they have different kinds of", "02:19", "structures and the way those structures", "02:21", "come together determines whether you", "02:22", "know it makes like a quartz crystal or", "02:24", "what shape it takes it's very it's very", "02:27", "surreal yeah I think honestly this is", "02:30", "very bizarre I did not know until you", "02:32", "gave this to me that that existed yeah", "02:34", "and this is it so like for me I went", "02:37", "into this book like you said right with", "02:38", "this question of what's natural there's", "02:40", "some people like often scientists who", "02:43", "will sort of scoff at the idea of", "02:44", "naturalness", "02:45", "right they're like everything's natural", "02:46", "right humans are natural were animals we", "02:48", "made all this stuff we made the", "02:50", "microphones we're all made out of space", "02:51", "dust", "02:52", "everything's natural it's stupid to", "02:54", "distinguish between natural and", "02:57", "unnatural and honestly that's where I", "02:58", "was when I started writing the book I", "03:01", "was like I'm gonna make I'm gonna show", "03:03", "this as a stupid idea I'm gonna I'm", "03:05", "gonna be Richard Dawkins but for", "03:08", "naturalness right but I was wrong I", "03:11", "don't know what shifted it for you well", "03:15", "so one of the things like with that pie", "03:16", "right right people ask is it natural", "03:19", "that's the first thing they ask does", "03:20", "this occur naturally right and it's an", "03:22", "important question because there's a", "03:24", "difference it's like a sort of profound", "03:25", "difference between knowing that that was", "03:29", "just spewed up by the earth forces that", "03:32", "are not human right versus humans", "03:35", "sitting down and deciding to make it", "03:37", "cute right it's like a diamond then that", "03:39", "has been shaped by millions of years of", "03:41", "natural forces and what I realized is", "03:43", "that it really does make sense to", "03:44", "distinguish between naturalness and", "03:47", "unnaturalness you have to maybe it's a", "03:49", "spectrum obviously right so it's not an", "03:51", "easy binary but New York City is not as", "03:53", "natural as Yellowstone right and what I", "03:56", "realized was I wasn't really against the", "03:59", "idea of naturalness or even valuing", "04:02", "nature right I mean we'll hopefully", "04:04", "we'll talk about I went back country in", "04:06", "Yellowstone it was unbelievable you know", "04:08", "I mean everyone values naturalness in", "04:10", "certain ways it was worshipping nature", "04:12", "that I had a problem with this idea that", "04:14", "the more natural something is the better", "04:16", "it is or that what we need to do like if", "04:19", "you want to raise your kid right you've", "04:20", "got to raise your kid naturally you like", "04:21", "you know let them piss in the corner or", "04:23", "like elimination communication do you",

"05:10", "anthropologists who work with", "05:11", "hunter-gatherers and I asked them like", "05:13", "how does you know how does body training", "05:14", "work and they were like mmm what do you", "05:16", "mean like people just fit in the forest", "05:18", "and right you know if you if you take a", "05:20", "shit in someone's lap they're gonna be", "05:21", "really upset at you exactly but there's", "05:27", "this idea right that that and so that's", "05:29", "how that's what we should be doing with", "05:30", "our children and and I don't know about", "05:32", "you but like we're not you know when we", "05:33", "had our daughter I was on line and I'm", "05:35", "like okay well how do i parent my child", "05:36", "what are the right things to do like", "05:38", "should she be in my

the natural way to", "05:46", "parent your kid so it must be better and", "05:49", "and I realized that was that was where I", "05:52", "had my problem that it's fine to love", "05:54", "nature", "05:54", "but you shouldn't worship it well human", "05:57", "beings have done horrible things to", "05:59", "their children from the beginning of", "06:00", "time without anybody telling them to do",

natural", "06:15", "so there was a there's a there was yeah", "06:18", "I mean you know I said essentially again", "06:19", "right if natural is defined is whatever", "06:22", "sort of emerges spontaneously out of", "06:25", "forces that weren't willed by human", "06:27", "beings yet which is what I think", "06:28", "naturally it's right so we say we have", "06:29", "natural instincts in other words", "06:30", "whatever we didn't we'll it just comes", "06:32", "out of us there's a there's a woman", "06:34", "who's an expert on captivity so", "06:35", "kidnapping slavery name Katherine", "06:38", "Cameron", "06:39", "and I was interviewing her she said you", "06:41", "know it is as natural as the nuclear", "06:43", "family to have slaves right so slavery", "06:46", "is a thing that has been done for ever", "06:50", "and ever I mean you imagine right so", "06:51", "your pre-agricultural your tribe your", "06:54", "group requires certain population can't", "06:57", "get too high can't get too low and so", "06:59", "kidnapping other people's children often", "07:02", "a common thing yeah so is that good well", "07:06", "clearly not right or you know dying in", "07:08", "childbirth the these these are all", "07:12", "things that are natural but are", "07:14", "obviously not good and so I started I", "07:17", "started to see the way in which this", "07:18", "word was being abused basically people", "07:20", "would use natural describe whatever they", "07:21", "favored and unnatural to describe", "07:23", "whatever they didn't like right people", "07:25",

this conversation to millions of", "09:03", "people and to think that that", "09:05", "simultaneously people would be thinking", "09:07", "themselves the criteria I'm gonna use to", "09:09", "judge whether something is good or bad", "09:11", "with a capital G or a capital B is how", "09:14", "natural it is right this is totally", "09:16", "unnatural as unnatural as unnatural as", "09:18", "it gets meanwhile the coronavirus rate", "09:20", "which is you know natural of course", "09:22", "people will say well actually we", "09:24", "wouldn't have been infected if only we", "09:25", "lived more naturally right so the", "09:26", "problem is urban density or the problem", "09:28", "is that you shouldn't be going into the", "09:30", "jungle and getting things but like this", "09:32", "is you know there's actually an argument", "09:33", "against that though the the the virus", "09:36", "itself more evidence is coming out daily", "09:38", "that it's been manipulated that it most", "09:40", "likely did come out of that lab I had", "09:43", "Brett Weinstein on the podcast who's a", "09:45", "biologist and he was talking about all", "09:47", "the the various aspects of the virus", "09:49", "that really don't exist naturally in in", "09:53", "in in this form without having evolved", "09:56", "for a long period of time the fact that", "09:57", "it just emerged and made this leap from", "09:59", "bats to the form that it is now people", "10:01", "he's like it's far too contagious it's", "10:04", "far too prolific it's there's so many", "10:06", "different I'm gonna fuck it up if I talk", "10:08", "about the technical details of it but", "10:09", "when he was describing and he was saying", "10:11", "more evidence points to the fact that it", "10:14", "was actually something that had been", "10:15", "manipulated by people then that it was a", "10:18", "natural virus so I mean I don't I'm not", "10:20", "a biologist no I have no idea but I", "10:24", "think what I think what's weird or what", "10:26", "I would want to push back on and this is", "10:27", "a religious studies scholar right", "10:28", "because this is this is where I came to", "10:30", "all the naturals natural stuff to begin", "10:32", "with is if something's bad I think", "10:36", "people are immediately gonna think oh it", "10:38", "makes sense that it was unnatural it", "10:40", "makes sense that this bad thing that's", "10:42", "hurting us couldn't be natural but but", "10:45", "the truth is some things that hurt us", "10:48", "are natural cyanide there you go", "10:51", "well you know again

relationship with technology and", "11:17", "all that stuff i'm never gonna forget i", "11:19", "go up to this this guy and I ask him", "11:22", "they've just had solar lights installed", "11:25", "like in the main sort of area of their", "11:27", "village and I go up to this guy and I", "11:29", "was like how do you feel about having", "11:32", "these artificial lights installed and he", "11:35", "and and I'm thinking to myself you know", "11:37", "it's this pollution right isn't it", "11:38", "better to just have you know the stars", "11:40", "in the sky and the moon and he looks at", "11:42", "me and he goes he goes this is good we", "11:45", "can see at night now he's just like he", "11:48", "was talking to just a fucking idiot you", "11:49", "know like of course I'm happy

so you", "11:58", "could wash your dishes and and your", "12:00", "clothes and I'm thinking oh my god this", "12:02", "is ripping them away from the natural", "12:04", "way of life and I asked this like I'm", "12:06", "like how do you feel about the water and", "12:08", "she's like it's we don't we don't get", "12:10", "bacteria you shouldn't say bacterial", "12:12", "infection she was like we don't get sick", "12:14", "anymore from the water that we're", "12:15", "drinking from the river I was like oh", "12:17", "and she's just looking at me like who it", "12:19", "like why is he asking me this right and", "12:22", "meanwhile I'm coming from this place", "12:24", "where everyone wants to get closer to", "12:25", "nature right because we have been", "12:26", "alienated from it and and I'm asking", "12:28", "from the perspective of someone who", "12:29", "thinks it just must be paradise living", "12:33", "so close to nature and she's like no we", "12:35", "want that we want to wash our clothes", "12:37", "and have fucking lights on at night Yeah", "12:39", "right there was a shaman I'm talking the", "12:43", "shaman in the village don't Alberta", "12:44", "right and he's talking he's like you", "12:45", "know it's true that technology is", "12:47", "messing up the world we've got climate", "12:49", "change we've got you know all these", "12:50", "species are going extinct and he goes on", "12:52", "and on right it's he's very close to", "12:53", "nature very very wise man he's got a", "12:57", "cell phone also right and and I'm like", "13:00", "well this was technology bad and he's", "13:02", "like he's like yes well yes yes and no", "13:05", "he's on tinder that's and that's I want", "13:12", "people I just want people to understand", "13:14", "that there just aren't any easy", "13:16", "categories you can use to divide up the", "13:19", "world", "13:20", "to good and bad and now that people now", "13:23", "that organized religion sort of the", "13:24", "sphere of

"walking through the store what sort of", "13:44", "criteria can I use to divide the world", "13:47", "up easily into good and evil clean and", "13:51", "unclean organic organic and inorganic", "13:54", "right yeah artificial and it's built", "13:56", "into our language Joe like artificial", "13:59", "artificial a artificial right is is", "14:03", "linked to artifice which is deception", "14:05", "right so you've got manipulated which", "14:09", "really just means humans got a hold of", "14:11", "it and changed it with their hands also", "14:14", "means something bad so really built into", "14:17", "our language we have this idea that", "14:20", "natural means good artificial", "14:23", "manipulated that's bad I think maybe", "14:27", "it's because we have this insane power", "14:31", "to manipulate things and we we all", "14:35", "collectively use the power to manipulate", "14:38", "things that was created by scientists", "14:40", "that have a far greater understanding of", "14:43", "what the implications and like what the", "14:46", "process of this manipulation is and we", "14:48", "just come along and use their technology", "14:50", "and that's I think that's that's a", "14:52", "problem with so much of what people do", "14:54", "like we've we've earned this power just", "14:58", "by virtue of being alive and being able", "15:01", "to trade in goods and services for", "15:03", "whatever that they've created and then", "15:05", "we don't think about the consequences of", "15:06", "utilizing this stuff like what is", "15:08", "there's got to be there's some sort of a", "15:11", "balance right there's a balance between", "15:12", "like if you want to have a fireplace in", "15:16", "your house that's wonderful fireplaces", "15:18", "are great it's a nice smell right you", "15:21", "walk in the house you smell a fireplace", "15:23", "if you're walking down the street and", "15:24", "someone's got their fireplace on it", "15:25", "smells good but if the whole fucking", "15:28", "place is on fire it's terrible you", "15:30", "filled with smoke you can't breathe it's", "15:32", "like there's a balance", "15:33", "and clearly when you see polluted cities", "15:36", "clearly when you see polluted rivers and", "15:39", "we're destroying the environment there's", "15:41", "a lack of balance we've utilized this", "15:44", "power that we have to manipulate our", "15:45", "environment but we've done it completely", "15:47", "irresponsibly or we've done it without", "15:49", "the but without a awareness of the", "15:52", "consequences of eight million people", "15:55", "doing the exact same thing yeah well I", "15:56", "mean the scale you can do stuff on with", "15:59", "you technology has really increased it's", "16:01", "made us incredibly powerful right", "16:02", "there's Stewart Brand the guy who", "16:03", "started the whole earth catalogue", "16:04", "you know said basically we've become", "16:06", "like gods so we have to be able to wield", "16:08", "this power responsibly I think it's easy", "16:11", "to see that and say well then the evil", "16:13", "is in the form of the power itself right", "16:16", "obviously then if we've got a nuclear", "16:18", "bomb or we've got you know if we're", "16:20", "polluting the world then the problem is", "16:22", "with with the technology itself so you", "16:24", "locate

how", "27:56", "to conquer stomach share and they", "27:58", "started with cocaine which is even more", "27:59", "weird did you know it's still I", "28:03", "discovered that was I was like wait", "28:05", "there's a plant in New Jersey that's", "28:07", "yeah that's the number one supplier of", "28:09", "medical cocaine's okay it's coca-cola we", "28:12", "should tell people just tell people the", "28:13", "what the what we're talking about for", "28:15", "people don't know yeah well so so", "28:17", "coca-cola back in the day was made with", "28:20", "with with cocaine for the for the", "28:22", "cocaine Kick John Pemberton the guy who", "28:23", "the guy who came up with coca-cola had", "28:26", "cocaine in it and to this day there is a", "28:29", "plant that's been grandfathered

Pepsi unfortunately perhaps you", "28:52", "don't taste as good as coke you", "28:54", "just don't today there's no cocaine in", "28:55", "it yeah well it's the flavonoids this is", "28:57", "there's some I think that's the right", "28:59", "word there's some flavor that the coca", "29:02", "leaf has I've never had chewed coca leaf", "29:05", "but people who I've talked to that have", "29:08", "had it said it's an amazing way to get", "29:11", "energy it's like a cup of coffee they", "29:14", "gave it to us when we went when you", "29:16", "arrived when we arrived in it's like", "29:18",

"29:27", "and it's nothing like that so it's it's", "29:29", "a it's because cocaine right is a ultra", "29:33", "processed form rye of what is in the", "29:37", "coca leaves yeah exactly", "29:38", "yeah that's how it's been described to", "29:40", "me unfortunately I've never maybe", "29:41", "fortunately I've never done coke but I", "29:43", "have had mati de coca the the tea from", "29:46",

"29:53", "fuck up you give me this stuff this is", "29:55", "awful we've got I want to I want to get", "29:57", "back to some what cocaine that we got", "29:59", "sighs yeah coca-cola yeah", "30:00", "ultra-processed foods stomach share all", "30:02", "right we're back we're back where we", "30:04", "should tell people that this coca", "30:06", "coca-cola when they do take the coca", "30:08",

"is are the people that do that so", "30:20", "literally medical cocaine like lidocaine", "30:22", "and all that shit", "30:24", "comes from I didn't know I didn't know", "30:26", "it's the same plant that's crazy crazy", "30:28", "yeah that's medical cocaine so these", "30:31", "people are trying to conquer our", "30:32", "stomachs and they did it right and one", "30:34", "of the ways they did it also was make it", "30:35", "cheap and accessible", "30:36", "there's vending machines in every school", "30:38", "I mean think for a second how crazy that", "30:39", "is that there are vending machines with", "30:43", "just coca-cola and candy bars and stuff", "30:45", "in every single school we have you know", "30:47", "it's that but but it happened right and", "30:50", "so now we live in a world in which", "30:52", "extremely cheap highly palatable and", "30:55", "very accessible food is everywhere no", "30:59", "wonder we have a problem with our diets", "31:02", "and that's exactly what's happening with", "31:05", "information right now so I as", "31:08", "as I understand it the way in which", "31:10", "Twitter was designed for example they", "31:11", "consulted with people who wanted to", "31:13", "figure out how to keep you compulsively", "31:15", "coming back so like slot machines right", "31:17", "they consulted with people who build", "31:19", "slot machines to figure out okay what", "31:22", "Pete what keeps people pulling the lever", "31:24", "right so they could just have it refresh", "31:25", "you just have your tweets at the top but", "31:28", "instead there's a little alert button", "31:29", "right you pull down there's a little", "31:31", "noise like or whatever the noise is when", "31:33", "you when you pull down on it you know", "31:34", "and so they've made it compulsive", "31:38", "they've made it highly palatable right", "31:42", "you want to you want to keep coming back", "31:43", "and the thing is the difference between", "31:46", "ultra

have a this going to demonize", "32:19", "someone and it's going to be something", "32:21", "that gives you a sense of belonging", "32:22", "those are the three things I think that", "32:23", "make information highly processed and", "32:26", "highly palatable we want a hit of", "32:28", "information that's easy to understand", "32:30", "that demonizes someone and that gives us", "32:34", "a sense of belonging and that's just", "32:36", "like exploiting what humans want right", "32:37", "you're saying you know we're creatures", "32:38", "that want to love each other we want to", "32:40",

you've just done some weird", "85:50", "shit to water to make it white you know", "85:53", "it's not milk", "85:54", "but if you can recreate steak if you can", "85:57", "do so like if you can 3d

right it actually means birth", "86:41", "from the Torah origins so naturalness", "86:43", "has to do with the origins of a thing", "86:45", "and we think about origins a lot when we", "86:48", "think about", "86:49", "what a thing is right we want to know", "86:50", "where it came from and that tells us", "86:53", "what it is", "86:54", "right and so with a stake there's gonna", "86:56", "be a lot of people who are gonna say you", "86:57", "can't call it a stake unless its origin", "87:02", "is a cow there's me other people who are", "87:06", "gonna say no if it's if it's if it looks", "87:09",

like that I've", "87:25", "had this conversation yeah upset it's", "87:27", "because it's not the same thing well", "87:29", "it's cheaper that's the only reason why", "87:31", "it's magical they know

right even if it's", "90:18", "indistinguishable to people looking in", "90:21", "that the animals", "90:22", "there's something about maintaining", "90:27", "genealogical purity or something like",

because", "90:48", "Yellowstone in particular has some of", "90:51", "the most domesticated elk that you'll", "90:53", "ever be around it's so bizarre I was", "90:56", "there with my children and we were", "90:57", "taking selfies with the elk and they", "90:59", "were like 30 or 40 feet away from us or", "91:02", "it was probably more like 20 yards but", "91:04", "close enough that in nature that would", "91:06", "fucking never happen they would run like", "91:08", "hell if they saw people or they saw any", "91:11", "animal that looked like it was a facing", "91:14", "forward predator", "91:15", "and in Yellowstone they're so accustomed", "91:18", "to people and they've actually adapted", "91:20", "their behavior to congregate around the", "91:22", "parks because they're less likely to be", "91:24", "killed by wolves there so they'll go", "91:27", "around these like visitor areas and", "91:29", "there was a fucking vending machine and", "91:32", "then thirty yards away from the

the", "91:43", "Bears there oh yeah yeah it was there", "91:45", "when they fed the middle yes when I was", "91:48", "a kid me and my parents went through", "91:49", "Yellowstone when I was like 7 or 8 years", "91:53", "old and there was cars in front of us", "91:55", "that would put food out the windows and", "91:57", "the Bears who put their paw on the car", "91:59", "and take food from them I think example", "92:02", "is a good one for I mean me I might be", "92:04", "wrong but for what I was arguing which", "92:06", "is that you seen the domesticated elk", "92:08", "they're right if Yellowstone for me when", "92:09", "I visited right it was likely this these", "92:11", "bears yeah so strange yeah I witnessed", "92:17", "this firsthand when I was a kid it's", "92:19", "it's no they would also congregate I", "92:22", "look at that that's really crazy look at", "92:24", "this lady out of her fucking mind she's", "92:26", "gonna climb out of the thing I'm sure a", "92:29", "lot of people got killed that way too by", "92:30", "the way this was they were the heads of", "92:33", "the people that like headed up", "92:34", "Yellowstone encouraged this stuff yeah", "92:37", "they didn't know any better right Wow", "92:41", "also you know the the bear is the", "92:45", "problem is they Bears are uniquely they", "92:49", "have habits that they form in terms of", "92:51",

"93:06", "way so this is the elk that you saw at", "93:09", "that vending machine and you tell me I'm", "93:11", "curious how you felt about it to me", "93:13", "seeing that kind of thing in Yellowstone", "93:15", "is a little disappointing and it's", "93:18", "disappointing because I think of", "93:19", "Yellowstone as like you know and it's", "93:21", "advertised this way right come here to", "93:23", "see and it's on all the books in the", "93:25", "tourist shops we come here to see pure", "93:28", "nature okay first of all there's no way", "93:32", "there's no way you're gonna have", "93:33", "buildings that's their cars in pure", "93:36", "nature it's not real I I'm a hunter so I", "93:41", "go into the woods I get most of my meat", "93:44", "from mountains I bow hunt so and one of", "93:48", "the reasons why I do this I started out", "93:50", "in 2012 because I was either gonna", "93:52", "become a vegetarian I was gonna become a", "93:54", "hunter I was watching

"94:03", "also yeah yeah I mean I just I had tried", "94:06", "to figure out a way to I had but morally", "94:11", "I was coming to this point in the road", "94:14", "where I was like I've got to do", "94:15", "something yeah I either have to figure", "94:18", "out a way to acquire my own meat and and", "94:20", "be comfortable enough like I've never", "94:21", "killed an animal I mean I need to be", "94:23", "able to kill this animal and eat it and", "94:25", "be comfortable with it or not like I", "94:28", "don't know if I am and once I went", "94:31", "hunting I realized okay this is probably", "94:33", "the most insanely connected way and it", "94:36", "really hits some switches inside of your", "94:39", "body", "94:40", "inside of your DNA that I didn't even", "94:43", "know we're there and these switches that", "94:45", "like connectives it's almost like a", "94:46", "psychedelic experience it's very strange", "94:48", "like being in the wilderness stalking an", "94:51", "animal and locking eyes with it and", "94:53", "hunting it and then wind up eating it", "94:55", "over a fire it's it's all these switches", "94:58", "go it's very strange", "95:00", "in a very positive way in a in a very", "95:02", "reverential way like you revere this", "95:05", "animal like you you you appreciate it in", "95:08", "this really intense way but these are", "95:11", "wild wild animals you're domesticating", "95:15", "an animal if they're hanging out all", "95:17", "along like I was looking at the house", "95:19", "once in Colorado with my family and we", "95:23", "went out into the backyard and there was", "95:24", "a giant deer like a huge buck that was", "95:27", "just standing there staring us it was in", "95:29", "Boulder Colorado and I don't know if you", "95:31", "ever been to Boulder Colorado but it's", "95:33", "like a lot of hippies and obviously no", "95:35", "one's hunting in Boulder Colorado so", "95:36", "these deer are completely relaxed", "95:39", "they're just chilling and so this deer", "95:41", "is", "95:42", "mean no more than a hundred feet away", "95:44", "from us just staring at us just looking", "95:47", "at us and then just moves around a", "95:48", "little and eat some grass and looks at", "95:50", "us again and my wife is like I didn't", "95:52", "even think that was real I thought it", "95:53", "was a statue until it started moving I", "95:55", "would never kill that deer not in the", "95:58", "fucking million years I was out that's", "96:00", "like killing someone's dog", "96:01", "there's no way I mean I would have to be", "96:03", "starving to kill that deer but if I was", "96:06", "in the woods and I saw a deer that big I", "96:09", "would be very excited I'd be like wow", "96:11", "that's like hundreds of pounds of meat", "96:13", "look at the size of that dia it's an", "96:15", "amazing specimen and it's a big old", "96:17", "mature deer which means that it's passed", "96:19", "its genes on for

complicated issue one of", "97:03", "the reasons why it's a complicated issue", "97:04", "is because buffalo contained brucellosis", "97:07", "they they have brucellosis which can be", "97:09", "very

he's", "103:17", "talking about that it was on the cover", "103:18", "of a book called the ecological Indian I", "103:21", "think it's called by a guy named", "103:22", "Shepherd Kretsch which is he was looking", "103:24", "at the history I mean for one speaking", "103:26", "of Native Americans in Yellowstone how", "103:27", "crazy is it that because we think of", "103:29", "natural as not human involved one of the", "103:32", "things to make Yellowstone natural is he", "103:34", "got rid of all of the like humans yeah", "103:37", "that we're living there you know", "103:39", "naturally I mean I remember I went there", "103:41", "was actually when I was there there was", "103:42", "a hunting blind that was left over from", "103:44", "when Native Americans were in", "103:46", "Yellowstone died yeah it was really cool", "103:48", "my guide showed me just like it's you", "103:50", "know just a little hunting blind that", "103:52", "they would use and it it also yeah again", "103:55", "right it made me realize right", "103:56", "Yellowstone is not pure nature that even", "103:58", "our understanding of nature and", "104:00", "naturalness if you get rid of like", "104:02", "getting rid of humans run is getting rid", "104:06", "of a part of the naturalness of what", "104:08", "this place was before or just the having", "104:11", "humans in cars in collect these animals", "104:15", "and getting them conditioned to it that", "104:17", "becomes unnatural but even you know and", "104:20", "or does it well yeah I think it does", "104:22", "right I used to I I would have wanted to", "104:25", "say a long time ago oh no there's no", "104:26", "such difference but ya know man a fuckin", "104:28", "Road it's less natural than no Road I", "104:31", "don't know it like that that and then", "104:32", "the same thing happened with sports", "104:34", "which was I mean with Yellowstone right", "104:36", "is more and less natural right and it", "104:38", "would be sad if Yellowstone became much", "104:40", "more unnatural it would take away from", "104:43", "you know if they put in like an", "104:45", "amusement park or whatever is they're", "104:46", "trying to do to like figure out how to", "104:47", "raise funds it at these places and this", "104:50", "it's because part of what we value about", "104:52", "Yellowstone even though it's impure and", "104:54", "even though it's imperfect is that we", "104:56", "get we get to see something more natural", "104:59", "than we do yeah that is ooh exact far", "105:02", "superior to a zoo exactly as you can see", "105:04", "that you can see a grizzly bear", "105:06", "no one's feeding the grizzly bears the", "105:08", "grizzly bear has to eat by killing that", "105:09", "bison right that's far superior and", "105:12", "that's the same thing with the same", "105:14", "thing with sports so like I that was", "105:16", "another one of the things that really", "105:17", "convinced me that I needed to rethink my", "105:19", "relationship with naturalness which is", "105:21", "that you know so I went to a I went to a", "105:23", "natural bodybuilding competition I know", "105:26", "you had Ronnie Coleman on like I've", "105:27", "never been to a bodybuilding competition", "105:29", "before and so I went in and it was a", "105:31", "natural bodybuilding competition and", "105:33", "these you know these people were they", "105:36", "had you could smell the spray tan from", "105:39", "you know I was in the radios in the room", "105:42", "with them backstage I was like these are", "105:43", "the most unnatural people I've ever seen", "105:45", "right they've been what is it called", "105:47", "sodium cycling or something to like cut", "105:49", "their subcutaneous fat so that they I", "105:51", "mean they've done everything you could", "105:52", "possibly do to get their bodies into", "105:55", "this form and I'm like what this is a", "105:58", "great example this was gonna be my", "106:00", "example that I used to show that", "106:02", "naturalness and sports was stupid", "106:04", "because all it really meant was that you", "106:05", "weren't taking a certain list of drugs", "106:08", "right that's it that's all it meant", "106:10", "everything else about it was unnatural", "106:11", "right from the tans but but the the", "106:14", "truth is that sports are about", "106:18", "naturalness that they are a celebration", "106:21", "of natural talent there's no way you", "106:25", "know people call it god-given talent", "106:27", "right which is again the the connection", "106:28", "between God and nature but you can't", "106:30", "have sports as we understand them", "106:33", "without thinking about them as a", "106:35", "celebration of what the human body can", "106:37", "do right when you see that guy Alex", "106:38", "Honnold is that isn't it yet when you", "106:40", "see him free climbing like that yeah a", "106:43", "part of what you're thinking I think I", "106:45", "mean it's not just that he's like he", "106:46", "could die right but it's also like a", "106:47", "look at what the human body", "106:49", "on you know unaided by anything else", "106:52", "yeah look what it can do and that's why", "106:54", "we care when Elliot kept chogi you know", "106:57", "when he runs when he runs his marathon", "106:58", "record it makes sense to ask how much", "107:02", "was in the shoes right not because I", "107:04", "could run that fast you know with those", "107:05", "explain what you mean by that because", "107:07", "yet so so so so when you said you know", "107:10", "setting a marathon record there's an", "107:13", "incredible marathoner named Elliot Kip", "107:14", "chogi and there are these Nike had these", "107:16", "new shoes called vapor flies and he was", "107:20", "using these shoes and after he broke the", "107:23", "marathon record just shattered it", "107:25", "people were like wait a second how much", "107:27", "of that can be attributed to him and how", "107:31", "much of it is just the technology in the", "107:34", "shoes right and and this set off again", "107:37", "one of these like back and forth it was", "107:38", "totally useless online where some people", "107:40", "were like I can't believe you're taking", "107:41", "his accomplishment away from him and", "107:42", "other people were like it's all but you", "107:43", "know it's obviously the shoes but but", "107:45", "for me it's just a it's a broader", "107:47", "conversation about well so what is it", "107:48", "that we care about in sports right if", "107:50", "you put a pair of shoes on someone and", "107:52", "all of a sudden they're 5% 10% faster", "107:55", "that matters right Jamie you actually", "107:57", "know about this right you were you're a", "107:59", "runner what it was how much they've made", "108:02", "him just the pair he has is various very", "108:06", "very specific to what he was trying to", "108:08", "do yes yeah they tailored the course to", "108:10", "be specific also yeah they brought in", "108:13", "top-level Pacers to cycle in every like", "108:18", "100 I pray every mile I don't know", "108:20", "exactly how they did it but when they", "108:22", "first started making these pair of shoes", "108:24", "they called they're called the 4% cuz I", "108:25", "made a made you 4% faster really there's", "108:28", "like there was a think like a titanium", "108:30", "plate placed in the middle of it so like", "108:32", "normal like even this shoe I have now", "108:34", "you can you can bend this in half and", "108:36", "whatnot you can do this with that shoe", "108:38", "mmm is the place as you hit it like", "108:42", "launches you kind of forward like a", "108:43", "spring like like us it's not a spring so", "108:46", "it's just a very my new assistance but", "108:49", "yeah the best writer in the world it", "108:51", "helped him get 159 40 they're actually", "108:53", "selling these insoles that are made out", "108:56", "of carbon fiber similar to that yeah now", "108:58", "that big-ass heel on the back which is", "109:01", "so poor part my wife has a pair of those", "109:03", "and I what the fuck is that he'll at", "109:05", "least seems so crazy to walk around", "109:06", "really weird to walk around and I don't", "109:09", "think I've ever warned him here I have a", "109:10", "pair at home they're specifically for", "109:14", "running on the road fast so honest", "109:18", "renting yeah yeah so that's why it's got", "109:21", "all the cushion right there very", "109:22", "protected - yeah yeah so that's a real", "109:26", "good question right is that how much of", "109:28", "a factory he I would think he would", "109:30", "fucking you'd have to wear a regular", "109:32", "pair of shoes if you want to break a", "109:33", "record that's right so this is that's", "109:35", "exactly right so then was right and you", "109:36", "would never do this with a mathematician", "109:37", "right you know if a mathematician had a", "109:39", "new proof right you'd never be like now", "109:41", "hold on a second are you drinking coffee", "109:44", "did you know no one cares like did you", "109:47", "when you invented that new car what kind", "109:50", "of neutral yes that no one cares because", "109:53", "the way we evaluate mathematical but", "109:56", "what we care about with a mathematical", "109:58", "proof or a new invention isn't", "110:00", "showcasing the natural talent you know", "110:02", "whatever that means is the tough thing", "110:04", "to you know the mathematician whereas", "110:05", "with Kipp choji's record what we're", "110:07", "wondering that in part is what is he", "110:11", "doing what is he doing in a way that is", "110:14", "separate from what his shoes are doing", "110:16", "and that means that in sports at least I", "110:19", "have to admit that naturalness is an", "110:23", "important factor it is an important", "110:25", "factor but it's a weird one because it's", "110:31", "not an even slate it's not a good like", "110:34", "it's not an even playing field like some", "110:36", "people have just incredible genetic", "110:38", "gifts and some people don't now if a", "110:40", "person doesn't and they take some", "110:43", "creatine and a bunch of different", "110:44", "substances and they they get in a cryo", "110:47", "tank every day after training and then", "110:49", "they're in a sauna every day and then", "110:51", "they're doing all these different things", "110:53", "where they're they have electronics", "110:54", "strapped to them to try to monitor their", "110:56", "heart rate and make sure that they're", "110:58", "getting the exact right amount of", "111:00", "training and no more and no less and", "111:02", "that the recovery is perfect for they", "111:03", "train harder how fucking natural is that", "111:05", "not very natural is why you said the", "111:08", "gift like is it Phil Heath I mean I", "111:10", "found out all this stuff up I think his", "111:11", "nickname is the gift and someone called", "111:13", "Randy Coleman inside his name", "111:17", "like like freak of nature right will say", "111:19", "this about people Ronnie Coleman sorry", "111:22", "yeah he's like I mean people will say", "111:23", "like oh could I get like could you get", "111:25", "built like that he's the first to admit", "111:26", "it yeah on the podcast he talked about", "111:28", "it openly even with what Jew and", "111:31", "whatever right this is like when I", "111:32", "talked about the natural bodybuilders", "111:33", "backstage he was like man I don't if", "111:35", "people want a juice they can juice", "111:37", "there's no way you know these people are", "111:39", "still the you know Ronnie Coleman still", "111:41", "like an incredible athlete Ronnie do you", "111:44", "know choose for the many many years I", "111:46", "was bodybuilding career and then once he", "111:49", "started doing he just he did it because", "111:50", "he got tired of losing to people that he", "111:52", "didn't think you should lose to right", "111:53", "and but but you know going back to what", "111:55", "you're saying which is true right is how", "111:56", "natural is it if you're doing all of", "111:58", "these things so yes Sports is impure", "112:00", "right in the same way like how fucking", "112:01", "natural is Yellowstone there's a road", "112:03", "going through it you've gotten these", "112:04", "domesticated at the same time you can't", "112:06", "take that criteria away entirely right", "112:10", "or I mean to give you an example right", "112:11", "let's take a Marcus REM or Oscar", "112:13", "Pistorius who people know about right", "112:15", "the murderer the murderer with with with", "112:19", "blades South African yan'er", "112:21", "that's right South African runner so you", "112:24", "can't like you can't just let him put on", "112:26", "any kind of leg right look right he can", "112:29", "have rocket launchers on his legs right", "112:30", "that would be unfair yeah and he can't", "112:32", "have like you know", "112:33", "Austin's Pistons are cold yeah but in", "112:37", "and even let's imagine that like you", "112:38", "could just invent a leg with no", "112:41", "mechanics in it right but it just made", "112:43", "him incredibly fast much faster than any", "112:45", "human being you'd be like nope that's", "112:46", "unfair we don't allow that that is the", "112:49", "argument about those cheetah legs right", "112:51", "that's exactly right so then what do you", "112:52", "have to do you have to test so that a", "112:54", "recent case happened they allowed", "112:55", "Pistorius in but there's a German

these pressure", "113:07", "plates it's really incredible what they", "113:09", "do to see whether his leg gives him an", "113:11", "advantage over what a natural leg right", "113:15", "so the baseline comparison here is does", "113:18", "your artificial leg give you an", "113:20", "advantage over a natural leg and what", "113:23", "blend whose natural light is it your", "113:26", "natural leg or Hussein bolts naturally", "113:28", "well I think", "113:29", "yeah exactly right so in his case it's", "113:30", "it's uh that what they tried to do with", "113:32", "these blades is they're like okay let's", "113:34", "figure out because he's out you know all", "113:36", "of these guys are world-class athletes", "113:37", "right so it's if it's some weird", "113:39", "hypothetical right where if Marcus REM", "113:41", "had a leg would he be performing at", "113:44", "about the same level as he does with his", "113:47", "artificial name and that and as weird as", "113:50", "it is as

stay out of this and right now I", "116:41", "mean I think you're right that there is", "116:42", "because sports are so symbolically", "116:44", "important right I mean you see this with", "116:46",

right", "117:34", "like that setting up the rules or", "117:36", "whatever I mean I talked with a", "117:37", "transgender scientist named Joanna", "117:39", "Harper about this who studies the",

anyone", "117:51", "compete without any regulations so the", "117:53", "the real question on the ground I think", "117:55", "that people are are", "117:56", "about is not whether there should be",

question", "118:06", "is like what do you do with testosterone", "118:08", "levels right so so duty chand right", "118:11", "let's say you're hyper androgynous but", "118:13", "you're xx chromosome yeah I explained", "118:15", "that woman who's this is the the issue", "118:18", "with her yeah so so one of the things", "118:20", "that people try to do in sports because", "118:22", "it's important

do you", "118:58", "distinguish so going back to duty Chand", "119:00", "right so if you make a testosterone rule", "119:04", "for example so you can only have", "119:06", "testosterone you know you can only", "119:08", "compete as a woman if your testosterone", "119:10", "is below a particular level that's the", "119:12", "problem with that is they would have to", "119:13", "test it every day

thought", "124:07", "process was I trained so hard to make an", "124:10", "ethical shot and to be accurate into to", "124:13", "practice my shot making routine till", "124:16", "it's a it's like

did it", "124:49", "and that's and Sports is one of those", "124:51", "things whereas it would be crazy to you", "124:54", "know to think to yourself well I'll give", "124:56", "you an example this is it's funny right", "124:58", "childbirth right so it'd be crazy to go", "124:59", "in the dentist's office and be like you", "125:01", "know I'd be really disappointed in", "125:02", "myself if the

totally I", "125:33", "was like why would anyone ever want to", "125:37", "experience like you could just have an", "125:39", "epidural yeah you know yeah you just", "125:42", "have no no pain right yeah right so with", "125:50", "sports but back to duty Chandra because", "125:52", "I think it's really important because", "125:52", "this is gonna come up and in our fucking", "125:54", "cultural environment it's gonna be nuts", "125:56", "right and I want people I hate the like", "125:59", "I hate how bad the conversations are", "126:02", "honestly about transgender athletes", "126:04",

you're xx", "126:40", "and a man if you're XY but then you've", "126:42", "got people who are X Y but androgen", "126:44", "insensitive so these are people who", "126:46", "biologically essentially grow up", "126:50", "as as women and they look like women", "126:53", "they compete as women and then they have", "126:55", "a chromosome they have a test right and", "126:57", "they find out that

had been competing as a", "127:07", "woman her whole life then the tests came", "127:09", "back and she was like well that's crazy", "127:10", "we see hermaphrodite she was not i mean", "127:13", "i as i understand it she was just", "127:15", "androgen insensitive so she was not", "127:17", "intersex this woman wasn't so did she", "127:21", "have a penis", "127:21", "she did not so she had a

"127:31", "these arguments and I want people to", "127:33", "have interesting discussions about this", "127:34", "his people will say they'll look at this", "127:37", "and and on one side of the
