long", "48:12", "10 or 20 connections that were coming in", "48:15", "and they were just", "48:17", "wouldn't say a bot they were like they", "48:19", "were scripts that were trying to log", "48:22", "into DVRs and trying to log in to like", "48:27", "IP cameras that you can control and", "48:29", "everything like that so I was watching", "48:31", "for that about a year period so let me", "48:34",

"48:51", "they testing for the test all their", "48:52", "flaws and they're trying to do is they", "48:55", "would try to they would be looking for a", "48:56", "linux login which would be like you know", "48:59", "login I can like if you were to tell net", "49:02", "or SSH into a device like that the first", "49:05", "thing we get was a login and usually its", "49:08", "route is the controller

try password then", "49:21", "they try like this they try that they", "49:23", "try the black you know so the Russian", "49:25", "bad thing I understand that but I don't", "49:27", "think it was a coordinated effort I", "49:29", "think that like all during that whole", "49:31", "time I was watching my computer like I", "49:33", "have it's kind of I'm getting real nerdy", "49:36", "here but it's like I have these games", "49:38", "that like in the people play and like", "49:40", "once you get past the 13th 14th 15th", "49:42", "node which essentially means like once", "49:45", "there's 15

all", "49:54", "of them just masse trying to just break", "49:56", "in and it was because of the DVRs and", "49:58", "because the IP cameras like they were", "50:00", "really literally trying to hack your", "50:02", "system to just do whatever I don't know", "50:05", "what the purpose was but I like I", "50:07", "watched it and it was it was China", "50:09", "mostly I mean Russia was a small
