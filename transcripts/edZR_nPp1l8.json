the", "26:50", "worst cities like San Pedro Sula", "26:52", "Honduras Caracas I'm Sara Juarez and", "26:56", "these are places which have levels of", "27:00", "violence which are like way worse than",

"27:20", "Wild West than like now there are some", "27:22", "place in the United States the de la", "27:24", "Owen idea I've done some research", "27:25", "recently in Baltimore Maryland and I was", "27:28", "kind of it's interesting to compare that", "27:29", "to Latin America and that's high level", "27:33", "as forty four hundred thousands that's", "27:35", "that's not as the same level but it's", "27:36", "significant still more than medieval", "27:39", "Europe yeah Wow", "27:40", "Baltimore's worse than medieval Europe", "27:42", "yeah I mean I think it's you have to", "27:44", "have to some professors there might in a", "27:46", "like you get like you know there might", "27:47", "be they might say well Jerusalem in this", "27:50", "time or in a line I like you got triumph", "27:51", "we nice hard to know it really dig down", "27:53", "exactly that there was outbreaks of", "27:55", "violence and killing in samples but the", "27:58", "overall our yeah of all average yeah", "27:59", "that's a significant leap 100 percent", "28:01", "leap yeah absolutely", "28:04", "Baltimore what about South Side Chicago", "28:05", "it's not that I mean like the level I", "28:10", "think in Chicago comes out around 20 or", "28:13", "something so it's not now the American", "28:16", "of the whole city", "28:16", "now these again and one of things about", "28:18", "the violence in the United States", "28:19", "compared to Latin America when Baltimore", "28:23", "is is significant but it's a fairly what", "28:26", "the city of Baltimore is a fairly small", "28:27", "place what they're talking about so in", "28:30", "Mexico you have entire states that are", "28:32", "like really violent or entire countries", "28:33", "in Latin America whereas in the US it", "28:36", "tends to be neighborhoods which are", "28:38", "violent so if you really focus on the", "28:41", "south side of Chicago it's probably", "28:42", "similar levels to Baltimore I think you", "28:44", "know it sir but if you look at the whole", "28:47", "city got neighbors that are pretty safe", "28:48", "in Chicago as well now through all of", "28:51", "this time", "28:52", "that you've spent down in Mexico have", "28:55", "you seen it you've seen it escalate", "28:57", "you've seen it get worse and worse yes", "28:59", "so there was first this really big", "29:02", "escalation happened in 2008 was the", "29:04", "first big escalation what was the cause", "29:06", "of that so you had there was a steady", "29:09", "buildup that was happening and then in", "29:13", "2006 do you had the President Felipe", "29:16", "Calderon declared a military crackdown", "29:20", "on drug cartels and after that with", "29:23", "there was this big response and things", "29:25", "started really getting out of hand we", "29:27", "had already seen violence escalating", "29:30", "before I think you know my idea my kind", "29:33", "of theory behind this is that you had in", "29:36", "Mexico back in a 20th century more of a", "29:39", "top-down centralized government", "29:42", "controlling everything you had the PRI", "29:45", "in power and they were basically they", "29:49", "were hauling it through corruption so", "29:50", "back then they'd have the drug cartels", "29:52", "working for them an interesting story", "29:55", "going back then to the 19 late 1970s", "29:58", "story in a book

yeah well done you know you", "30:38", "survived well you've got the job so we", "30:42", "know what it shows is that the police", "30:45", "had the upper hand to please control", "30:46", "this they were like okay we control this", "30:48", "racket and you know we can fuck around", "30:49", "and torture and kill drug traffickers", "30:51", "when we like you know in all up the", "30:55", "presidency I mean there was uh in that", "30:58", "time Carlos Salinas became president 94", "31:01", "his brother Raul Salinas there's the", "31:03", "Swiss investigate his bank accounts and", "31:06", "said", "31:06", "at 500 million dollars in bank accounts", "31:08", "we say you know they they believed it", "31:10", "was drug money", "31:11", "so right up to the presidency this was",

"31:21", "markets gonna happen you know in the", "31:23", "good days of the 21st century now but", "31:28", "what happened was you look the political", "31:30", "control shifted so you had a bunch of", "31:32", "different political parties and they", "31:35", "were fighting over the drug trade and", "31:36", "you know I was one time in rebel arezzo", "31:39", "when the federal police had a shootout", "31:41", "with the municipal police they were", "31:43", "fighting each other probably cuz they", "31:44", "work for different drug cartels so", "31:47", "that's what started but then you had the", "31:49", "techniques like the technique of", "31:51", "beheading wasn't really a big deal it", "31:55", "was very very rarely used up until", "31:57", "around 2006 and one of the first",

some gang", "84:56", "cartel gang that's invading your city", "84:58", "that seems that's a military weapon I", "85:02", "mean it's the same argument I think for", "85:04", "having a fighter jet with Hellfire", "85:07", "missiles do I think you should be able", "85:08", "to own a Cessna and fly a little print", "85:11", "plane around", "85:11", "sure okay do I think you should be able", "85:14",

on the end", "86:08", "of the barrel and will mitigate that but", "86:09", "for whatever reason I think mostly", "86:11", "because of films and public perception", "86:13", "people think that those silencers are", "86:15", "only used by assassins or something like", "86:17", "that you're using to kill people so they", "86:20", "they they convert the the", "86:21", "semi-automatics from the states that it", "86:23", "makes going to convert the fully", "86:24", "automatic ass so they they they do that", "86:25", "here too and then of course you know", "86:27", "about bump stocks yeah yes which makes", "86:29", "it much more free with the trigger much", "86:33", "much easier to fire rapidly rather so", "86:35", "how do you feel about the issue you know", "86:36", "one of the issues is
