each other with this", "06:37", "heartrate app so we're working out three", "06:39", "hours four hours a day was crazy but", "06:42", "what was interesting about it to me", "06:43", "was not just that your body sort of", "06:45", "adapts when you force it to work out", "06:47", "that many hours but that your mood is", "06:49", "phenomenal yeah I felt so good yeah and", "06:52", "I was telling everybody if you could", "06:53", "take what I like I don't feel that good", "06:56", "right now okay I mean I feel great but I", "06:58", "don't feel as good as I did during", "06:59", "October because I was working out four", "07:01", "hours a day it was if you could get that", "07:05", "in pill form you would take it everyday", "07:07", "if there was no side effects because it", "07:09", "literally removed anxiety all the", "07:13", "internal chatter all the negative", "07:15", "chatter it was gone everything seemed", "07:17", "amazing true and there are side effects", "07:19", "of physical activity are great you know", "07:21", "it revs up immune function improves", "07:23", "digestion sleep all that you mentioned", "07:25", "anxiety the the by far in a way the most", "07:28", "effective treatment I found for anxiety", "07:30", "is simple a simple breathing technique", "07:32", "no regulating the breath I've seen this", "07:35", "work for the most extreme forms of panic", "07:37", "disorder and the drugs that we use for", "07:39", "anxiety are the worst the", "07:41", "benzodiazepines highly addictive mess", "07:43", "with your mind yeah I have a good friend", "07:46", "who has an issue with anxiety medication", "07:48", "and he takes it all the time and when he", "07:50", "doesn't take it apparently it has that", "07:52", "rebound effect exactly right he gets", "07:55", "horribly anxious well these are handed", "07:57", "out like candy and nobody warns people", "07:59", "how addictive they are it's a worse", "08:01", "addiction than an opiate addiction it", "08:04", "Zanic yeah really yeah yeah", "08:06", "why I did not know that harder to get", "08:08", "off of than opioids Wow because out of", "08:11", "all those voices as long as you're not", "08:12", "personally trying to figure it out and", "08:15", "filter it yourself with your own which", "08:17", "is completely impossible but if you", "08:20", "could just look at it objectively from", "08:22", "afar this is going to work itself out", "08:25", "and a far better way than has ever", "08:26", "happened before in our past there's", "08:28", "never been this many voices yeah and our", "08:30", "pastors Benes like you were talking", "08:31", "about a select few voices the Walter", "08:33", "Cronkite's the whoever it is on at the", "08:36", "top and then everyone else sort of had", "08:38", "to wait for the narrative to be spelled", "08:40", "out for them", "08:41", "right that's not the case anymore that's", "08:43", "right and and again I think it's the", "08:45", "best of times in the worst of times so", "08:46", "it's the best of times because all these", "08:48", "new voices are bringing all sorts of", "08:51", "great perspective and insight and", "08:52", "intelligence to the to the story that", "08:55", "wasn't there before and that's great the", "08:58", "problem is is if the infrastructure that", "09:00", "used to be there to kind of bring us all", "09:03", "Paul bring us all up to a kind of basic", "09:05", "level so that we understood the facts", "09:07", "disappears so we don't have anything", "09:10", "that kind of makes it so that we all", "09:11", "understand what's at issue and what's at", "09:13", "stake and what the facts are so that we", "09:15", "can act as a democracy in a sensible way", "09:18", "then the question is how do we run a", "09:20", "democracy you know because if we could", "09:22", "have all these different you know I like", "09:24", "to think about the difference between", "09:25", "the culture channel and the democracy", "09:27", "channel so in the culture channel this", "09:29", "is the best of times by orders of", "09:31", "magnitude yeah stuff on television today", "09:33", "is a billion times better than anything", "09:35", "from the 1970s and 1980s", "09:38", "yeah and it's that's a product of this", "09:40", "incredible competition and the fact that", "09:42", "you can have anything and any niche", "09:45", "market and as long as it's enough it", "09:47", "makes sense to do it and that's what's", "09:49", "great but when you turn to the democracy", "09:51", "channel the same fragmentation the same", "09:54", "niche market the same reality of us all", "09:57", "living in these different universes", "09:58", "means we can't address problems as a", "10:02", "democracy with even the same facts and", "10:04", "that's a real problem because if we all", "10:06", "live in our own fact universe but we", "10:10", "have to same face the same real problems", "10:12", "in the same real earth then we're not", "10:14", "going to decide them in any sensible way", "10:16", "and how you solve that problem is really", "10:18", "hard like we're not going back thank God", "10:20", "we're not going back to the 1960s it's", "10:22", "just not going to be the case that there", "10:24", "are three channels we get to watch", "10:26", "that's just not gonna happen", "10:27", "um and and it's a great thing because", "10:29", "we've got all this amazing culture but", "10:30", "what do we do on the democracy side how", "10:32", "do we build a democracy recognizing that", "10:36", "everybody's not going to spend all their", "10:37", "time geeking out about campaign finance", "10:39", "reform legislation and and that's why I", "10:42", "think we need to think about these other", "10:43", "ways to bring people to some sensible", "10:45", "understanding", "10:51", "[Applause]", "English (auto-generated)"]
