so many different positive", "06:19", "hormetic benefits from doing cryotherapy", "06:21", "so you have you know the the the", "06:24", "anti-inflammatory part and this and this", "06:27", "also it's been shown that doing like ten", "06:29", "sessions of cryotherapy in a row it", "06:32", "increases the expression of glutathione", "06:34", "reductase by twofold and another Glu of", "06:38", "that fly own related enzyme glutathione", "06:39", "peroxide", "06:40", "by like 68% and these are these enzymes", "06:43", "like you could be taking all the", "06:45", "liposomal glutathione you want like it's", "06:47", "not going to matter if you don't have", "06:48", "the enzymes active to use it so you", "06:51", "could take liposomal glutathione and", "06:53", "that's great you're increasing you know", "06:55", "you're you make glutathione inside of", "06:57", "your cells but we can't make as much of", "07:00", "it as we get older but if you if you", "07:03", "take it you don't have the enzymes that", "07:04", "use it to actually do the good stuff", "07:06", "active that it doesn't matter", "07:07", "so cryotherapy it was shown to activate", "07:10", "two different include on related

your body's", "07:20", "ability to use it so if you fighting it", "07:22", "liposomal glutathione and then you're", "07:25", "using cryotherapy it would enhance it so", "07:28", "what I'm saying is that the liposomal", "07:30", "glutathione that you take all that does", "07:32", "is increase glutathione inside of your", "07:34", "cells glutathione inside of your cells", "07:36", "does nothing without enzymes that use it", "07:39", "to to basically sequester damaging", "07:44", "inflammatory things and the cryotherapy", "07:47", "increased activates the enzymes that use", "07:50", "it so it's like great I have all this", "07:52", "glutathione sitting around in my cells", "07:54", "that I've been taking and I also now", "07:56", "have the enzymes that use it to do good", "07:58", "stuff now are being turned on okay that", "08:00", "what was very interesting is that it", "08:01", "took like multiple sessions before", "08:04", "before those got acted like ten to", "08:06", "twenty ten and one at least ten and yet", "08:09", "and then the other study was twenty", "08:10", "seven was it consecutively I'm dead ten", "08:13", "days in a row yeah ten days in a row but", "08:17", "what the first day I didn't do it", "08:18", "so that that was also very interesting", "08:20", "so it's almost like your body's saying", "08:22", "okay this crazy fuck is going to do it's", "08:24", "an adaptive response yes yeah your", "08:26", "body's preparing for war it's like it's", "08:28", "stressful you know it's a stressful", "08:29", "response the other thing that's really", "08:31", "cool that we didn't talk about last", "08:33", "minute podcast is the thermogenic effect", "08:36", "when you when you release norepinephrine", "08:38", "so that's I keep going back to that", "08:41", "because it's like you can't refute that", "08:42", "steve novella no one no debunk er no", "08:45", "skeptic no I don't care who you are", "08:47", "you can't it's just it's consistent in", "08:49", "every type of cold exposure period it's", "08:53", "it's it's consensus you release", "08:55", "norepinephrine well there always seems", "08:56", "to be some sort of a rationalization", "08:58", "with a lot of the debunking like whether", "09:00", "it's the benefits of exercise whether", "09:02", "it's the benefits of cryotherapy that's", "09:04", "almost like a rationalization for not", "09:06", "doing it it's like you're looking for an", "09:08", "excuse to not do it and not really very", "09:11", "objective yes that was which was", "09:13", "disturbing about it's like this is like", "09:15", "your pooh-poohing something that's", "09:16", "alright people great yeah yeah I it was", "09:19", "clear I mean after I especially", "09:20", "especially after I did the two weeks of", "09:22", "research and I think there's a kind of", "09:23", "mentality when you're sometimes people", "09:26", "like to think I'm a deep bunker and I'm", "09:28", "not I am I am intentionally like because", "09:31", "if you get in this mentality of always", "09:34", "debunking something you're it's like", "09:37", "this spiral and you can't see the good", "09:39", "like you can't keep an open mind to like", "09:41", "get past you're like what's in your box", "09:43", "that you know and that's very dangerous", "09:45", "yeah I think that anything last blind", "09:47", "spot it is and there are a lot of", "09:49", "scientists that I know they're very", "09:50", "smart extremely smart but they are in", "09:53", "that loop where it's like just they have", "09:56", "to debunk and criticize like and it's", "09:58", "like you know at some point huge", "10:00", "discoveries are made by like connecting", "10:02", "the dots and like getting past that like", "10:04", "I mean you have to be critical being", "10:06", "critical is very important but you also", "10:08", "like I think there's a certain threshold", "10:10", "where you just start to like you know", "10:12", "you get to this like spiral that was", "10:14", "also was infuriating about this is the", "10:16", "data's out there this is not like it's", "10:18", "not there's no data it's like he made a", "10:20", "cursory examination of the evidence and", "10:23", "what he chose to focus on was it was so", "10:27", "subjective he focused on a study that", "10:30", "tested muscle soreness post exercise", "10:32", "with cryotherapy well actually the study", "10:35", "that he referred to as a meta-analysis", "10:36", "and it was subjective but it actually", "10:38", "came to the conclusion that there were", "10:40", "benefits however it said more studies", "10:43", "and that needed to be done because there", "10:45", "wasn't large enough sample sizes and the", "10:47", "quality of data was poor because they", "10:49", "were not double-blinded", "10:50", "placebo-controlled clinical trials and i", "10:52", "have to say to you so that so they're", "10:54", "actually what he recited in that article", "10:56", "there was a positive effect of the cryo", "10:58", "but the problem is is that because they", "11:02", "followed up with oh well it's poor", "11:04", "quality basically poor science that the", "11:06", "reality is is", "11:07", "that you can't do a double-blinded", "11:09", "placebo-controlled controlled trial with", "11:11", "cryotherapy like you're going to be cold", "11:13", "and you're going to be put in this", "11:14", "chamber where there's like cold or", "11:16", "you're not and you're gonna know oh you", "11:20", "know so anyways I thought that was", "11:21", "ridiculous I was like whatever I'm in", "11:22", "Oregon I'm gonna read about this stuff", "11:25", "just because I know I've experienced it", "11:27", "there's definitely something going on", "11:29", "and one of the things that happens is", "11:32", "the norepinephrine and when you release", "11:34", "when you release that in a warp nephron", "11:35", "it activates a pathway", "11:38", "inside of your cells that basically are", "11:42", "it causes your energy metabolism to ramp", "11:45", "up because you're trying to generate", "11:47", "heat you want basically your body wants", "11:49", "to your body is saying I don't want to", "11:50", "die I need to make heat and so a couple", "11:53", "of ways it can do that one it can shiver", "11:55", "and shivering is when your muscles start", "11:58", "to contract and that it requires energy", "12:00", "for your muscles to like twitch it's", "12:02", "very it's not very thermodynamically", "12:05", "favorable so you it's not a good way to", "12:07", "generate heat but you generate heat", "12:09", "because you have to like ramp up to", "12:11", "twitch but then what happens after", "12:13", "you've been exposed and actually this", "12:14", "happened to me because we did the cryo", "12:15", "twice the first time I did it I was", "12:18", "shivering like the entire time I was", "12:19", "shivering it was really crazy because", "12:21", "I've never shivered like that in my life", "12:23", "but the second time I went in I did not", "12:25", "shiver and after reading about it what", "12:27", "happens is your body quickly adapt so", "12:29", "you adapt and what happens is non", "12:30", "shivering thermogenesis", "12:32", "so the norepinephrine causes your", "12:35", "mitochondria which are the energy", "12:37", "producing little organelles inside of", "12:39", "your cells well it causes them in your", "12:40", "in your adipose tissue to like get", "12:43", "activated I mean it does this by", "12:45", "increasing the expression of a gene", "12:46", "called UC p1 which basically freaks your", "12:49", "mitochondria out because your", "12:51", "mitochondria are kind of like batteries", "12:53", "they're charged they have a negative", "12:54", "charge on the inside and a positive", "12:56", "charge on the outside well you see p1", "12:58", "totally uncouples that so that there's", "13:01", "no more charge and that charge is very", "13:03", "important because when that charge is", "13:04", "there your body knows okay I've been", "13:06", "making energy because the way you make", "13:08", "the charge is by making energy so when", "13:10", "the charge goes away your body's like oh", "13:12", "my god", "13:12", "I've got no energy so it just starts to", "13:14", "ramp up fat metabolism so it does that", "13:17", "and you start to make more mitochondria", "13:19", "so you're you're making more", "13:20", "mitochondria you're", "13:21", "cells and this is often called brown fat", "13:23", "so you can actually the reason it's", "13:25", "called brown fat is because when you", "13:27", "look at a fat cell under the microscope", "13:28", "if it has more mitochondria then it", "13:30", "looks Brown so you actually start to", "13:32", "burn fat and you have this thermogenic", "13:35", "because you're burning fat it's creating", "13:37", "heat as a by-product so you're warming", "13:38", "your body but it has this nice side", "13:40", "effect of burning fat which people like", "13:42", "and the more you expose yourself to the", "13:44", "cold the more you're browning your fat", "13:46", "the more you're increasing those", "13:47", "mitochondria your fat which means the", "13:49", "next time you're in the cold you can", "13:51", "tolerate it longer so people that have", "13:52", "been exposing themselves to cold like", "13:54", "yourself when you're doing the cryo you", "13:56", "know often you actually can tolerate the", "13:59", "colder for longer periods of time", "14:00", "because you have more mitochondria in", "14:03", "your fat cells and this allows you to", "14:06", "then generate more heat so and this has", "14:08", "been shown in people people that have", "14:10", "been exposed to cold that they've been", "14:12", "shown to increase their their brown", "14:15", "adipose tissue but like 38% if they're", "14:17", "exposed to 10 days of 50 degree air like", "14:20", "outside air just regular air that's it", "14:21", "50 degrees all day all day 10 days so", "14:24", "like 6 hours a day spoutin like you know", "14:27", "New York and the I don't know pretty", "14:29", "winter fall I don't know something like", "14:31", "that being out there for six hours for", "14:33", "10 days in a row men were able to", "14:35", "increase their brown adipose tissue by", "14:36", "38% that's why people from the east", "14:38", "coast or from the Northeast that moved", "14:40", "to a Californian and they go back during", "14:42", "the winter they go home I blood got too", "14:44", "thin well it really is there really is", "14:46", "like a physical factor of your body not", "14:48", "being accustomed to dealing with cold", "14:49", "yeah you adapt you adapt and that's", "14:51", "that's what brown adipose tissue and", "14:52", "that's really one call how cold got", "14:54", "really popular popularized because", "14:56", "people wanted to use it as a hack to", "14:57", "lose weight you know so they were like", "14:59", "oh if I did these cold showers I use it", "15:02", "for the brain benefits because I noticed", "15:04", "I feel really good and also more focused", "15:07", "so I like that and a lot of people I've", "15:10", "talked to have felt the same way but", "15:13", "then I think the other part of this", "15:14", "article was the the effects of it", "15:17", "blunting some of the strength training", "15:19", "and you know I talked about this in this", "15:23", "report that I wrote or the in the", "15:24", "podcast that I released on and it's so", "15:26", "complicated I had to like to sit there", "15:28", "and literally just read for like two", "15:29", "weeks to try to figure it out because", "15:31", "you know the problem is is that exercise", "15:34", "is a hormone extra", "15:35", "cold is a chromatic stress so exercise", "15:37", "itself you need some of the inflammation", "15:39", "you need the bad stuff to get the good", "15:41", "stuff that's how it works right but you", "15:44", "know the inflammation that's happening", "15:46", "happens while you're exercising and up", "15:48", "to one hour after one hour after that's", "15:51", "when the whole hormetic response kicks", "15:53", "in and this has been shown in multiple", "15:54", "studies one hour

degrees", "19:43", "that's not as cold as going into a - 180", "19:46", "or whatever cryo chamber but you can", "19:49", "also sit in the cold water for a lot", "19:50", "longer yeah so guys do it for 15 minutes", "19:53", "I think that there has been a study that", "19:56", "compared the more epinephrine release 20", "19:58", "seconds at 40 degree water up to the", "20:01", "shoulders is can",

shown that cryotherapy lower C", "20:58", "reactive protein which would be an", "20:59", "inflammatory marker and in the", "21:01", "glutathione related enzymes going up and", "21:03", "also

does and then also there's", "21:15", "been marked measurements of TNF alpha", "21:17", "going down like I said also another", "21:20", "marker that macrophages release", "21:22", "macrophage and

there's plenty of", "21:57", "evidence that there's benefits to", "21:58", "cryotherapy oh yeah so why would anybody", "22:01", "write an article like that um like I", "22:05", "said there's the there's the bad article", "22:07", "that was the anabolic blunting effects", "22:09", "which was done immediately after", "22:11", "exercise which made a huge splash", "22:13", "because it's like well you're", "22:15", "right your gains and then you have the", "22:19", "the hardcore very skeptical people that", "22:22", "are like well the quality of data you", "22:24", "know well the thing is is
