"pouring all over and you know again for", "96:06", "people to understand let me break your", "96:08", "nose and now let me punch it again right", "96:10", "okay you have no concept because what", "96:12", "I'm telling is you know during a fight", "96:14", "fighters don't feel pain the way people", "96:18", "think because there's adrenaline and", "96:19", "there's all these things and it's muted", "96:21", "you feel things and sometimes you really", "96:24", "start to feel him and as soon as you", "96:25", "really start to feel him you start to", "96:26", "lose really bad yeah and in that", "96:28", "situation where she had lost four rounds", "96:31", "badly okay", "96:33", "so what's gonna happen in the fifth you", "96:35", "think she's gonna come out with this", "96:36", "homerun shot okay okay if her mind is", "96:39", "still there maybe done it maybe it maybe", "96:42", "could happen but as soon as she says I'm", "96:44", "done I want out", "96:46", "hey it's a fight and did she receive", "96:51", "more damage after that statement in the", "96:55", "fifth round oh yeah", "96:56", "she received more damage and what I'm", "96:59", "telling you is it's like you

know if I", "98:10", "can actually this person is kicking my", "98:12", "ass to be that per se you are doing fine", "98:14", "what I need you to do is this you'll get", "98:17", "yourself together be

"108:33", "that the 170 pound weight class stayed", "108:36", "and remained is because the UFC they", "108:39", "said okay we'll agree to bringing in", "108:42", "more weight classes but we want to keep", "108:43", "the 170 because they didn't want to move", "108:45", "tyron woodley and they didn't want to", "108:48", "have to move their champions when it's", "108:50", "not a big deal but when we do a change", "108:53", "to the sport it's to the sport it's not", "108:56", "to the UFC it's not to Bellator it's not", "109:00", "to 1.so is ballot or adding weight", "109:02", "classes",

"109:40", "it is the jumps between like 85 and 205", "109:42", "and then it's 2005 and 210 heavyweight", "109:46", "into 65 it's crazy to see but and this", "109:49", "is where you get into this you

when you talk", "109:59", "about size now and when the skill level", "110:03", "is the same and the", "110:04", "is different I can tell you who's gonna", "110:06", "win that fight debate guys yes okay just", "110:09", "about every time so when you look and", "110:11", "you said if I went and said okay let's", "110:14", "take a look at Brock Lesnar versus Randy", "110:16", "Couture okay Brock Lesnar is coming in", "110:18", "weighing 265 for the for the scales and", "110:22", "he's 285 at least for that night Randy", "110:25", "Couture is coming in he's 224 for the", "110:27", "scales

that's stupid but", "110:50", "that's reality of what we do at times in", "110:52", "the heavyweight division so we do need", "110:54", "something that is well that's two or", "110:55", "five sort of you do have some heavy", "110:58", "weight so you dealing with the", "110:59", "percentage of the body size it's ok far", "111:01", "greater percentage of the body size", "111:02", "going from 125 to 185 versus your", "111:06", "biggest percentage is gonna be in that", "111:07", "155 to 185 that you've got more fighters", "111:11", "145 to 180 but what I'm saying is", "111:14", "someone fighting someone who's 60 pounds", "111:15", "larger than them when they're 125 pounds", "111:17", "is a way different thing percentage-wise", "111:19", "yes yeah yeah absolutely but it's it's", "111:22", "that same concept right I could sit", "111:24", "there and move it up to 40 fights still", "111:25", "ridiculous that you have a 205 to 265", "111:27", "you have a 60 pound weight loss that's a",
