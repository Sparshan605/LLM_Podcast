the door back so", "33:12", "that it has some kind of intelligence", "33:15", "unless that's a programmed move and has", "33:18", "there ever been anything that doesn't", "33:20", "get it like a virus or things go wrong", "33:22", "at some point of course this is all", "33:24", "gonna happen gonna go wrong it's gonna", "33:26", "go wrong but I wonder if that's a", "33:29", "programmed move like it told it the", "33:31", "exact steps to take and it measured out", "33:34", "all the inches and then knew the exact", "33:36", "movements to make or if it can", "33:39", "accurately accurately

gets weird is it if if it can", "34:13", "create if you could figure out well if", "34:16", "it works on this what kind of door do we", "34:18", "have here oh I see this thing's just a", "34:20", "slide is it gonna be able to figure that", "34:22", "out", "34:23", "that's that's kind of it's it's these", "34:26", "earning it seems like it would be able", "34:28", "to figure it out pretty easily", "34:29", "especially when you factor in that", "34:30", "everything in the future is gonna be", "34:32", "more like technological anyway like the", "34:34", "door is even you know like turning a", "34:36", "knob or sliding a door yeah this is", "34:39", "gonna be ridiculous because people are", "34:41", "just gonna be like Jedi's or whatever", "34:42", "you know how people have

most of us like you and I like", "35:14", "normal people are sitting back watching", "35:16", "this on internet videos going whoof", "35:20", "um what do we what do we do like when", "35:23", "when do we stop why don't we stop making", "35:27", "robots that could kill us like before", "35:29", "they're smart or after they're smart I", "35:31", "know they're smart they're gonna just", "35:33", "stay alive and obviously as soon as we", "35:36", "can latch guns on to them they're going", "35:39", "in yeah that's what a drone is yeah", "35:42", "think about whether the drone is what a", "35:44", "drone is if someone is piloting", "35:46", "something just because it's flying", "35:47", "around doesn't mean it's not a robot", "35:49", "all right that's a fucking robot it's a", "35:51", "robot

"36:31", "running through your Street I said the", "36:35", "problem I've always had with this idea", "36:37", "is like our battery life that we use on", "36:39", "stuff is terrible yeah it's gonna eat", "36:41", "people but what batteries are they using", "36:43", "in those drones that are flying up above", "36:45", "now that are over overseas doing damage", "36:48", "and whatnot are those like special", "36:50", "batteries that we don't have access to", "36:51", "that maybe in five years we will and the", "36:55", "question won't be so weird to us is are", "36:57", "you sure that that's the way those times", "36:59", "I was almost just gonna ask that I don't", "37:01", "know how they fly I don't think they're", "37:02", "gas powered though but well let's find", "37:04", "out it'd be a
