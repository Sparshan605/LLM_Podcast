we dismantle the state of israel", "71:38", "or is it going to look like enormous", "71:40", "bloodshed the likes of which we see in a", "71:42", "lot of these countries", "71:44", "surrounding it

i think in most americans", "125:55", "minds it's like", "125:56", "the shooting happens then it becomes a", "125:58", "hashtag then it becomes a t-shirt then", "126:00", "it becomes a memorial thing", "126:02", "a memorial concert i mean it's like", "126:03", "actually sickening", "126:05", "like the the choreography of it", "126:09", "and i think what's lost is what it looks", "126:10",

mean", "126:56", "for a million reasons but the fact that", "126:58", "we are living in a culture", "127:00", "that seems to worship people's freedom", "127:02", "to own those weapons more than human", "127:04", "life", "127:05", "seems crazy to me it really does", "127:09", "i get what you're saying the argument", "127:11", "against that would be", "127:13", "this look look the real crazies believe", "127:16", "that these things are happening", "127:18", "and that they're happening because of", "127:20", "the fact the government wants to take", "127:22", "away our guns", "127:23", "this is the real craziest wait explain", "127:25", "that i'm not sure i follow that they are", "127:27", "making these people do these things the", "127:29", "government that", "127:30", "the worst worst

either", "127:52", "using like manchurian candidate", "127:55", "type influence whatever the fuck they're", "127:57", "doing they're getting people to do this", "128:00", "and then even creating false flags where", "128:02", "these things didn't happen", "128:04", "so they can take away guns this is the", "128:05", "this i mean look this is like", "128:07", "swamped here this is like pizza gate", "128:09", "like it is you're right it is it is", "128:11", "it is dumb but it's real it's real in", "128:14", "terms of", "128:14", "the influence that it has that people", "128:16", "actually do believe that there", "128:18", "are these false flag events that they're", "128:21", "designing to", "128:22", "to get your guns that people are", "128:24", "training people", "128:25", "to go out and kill a bunch of people so", "128:27", "they can take away your guns", "128:29", "so it makes them more rabid about their", "128:31", "support of the second amendment", "128:33", "and they they feel like they're being", "128:34", "attacked on all sides", "128:36", "have you had michael schumer on here", "128:38", "like recently oh this week", "128:40", "the cons the mindset of the conspiracy", "128:43", "thinker is totally fascinating to me", "128:45", "it is uh mick west is actually just as", "128:48", "good or even better he runs metabunk", "128:50", "okay he's a fascinating guy i i used to", "128:53", "use this show i did the show for a while", "128:55", "on", "128:55", "sci-fi called joe rogan questions", "128:57", "everything and one of the things that we", "128:58", "went into", "128:59", "was uh why people believe in chemtrails", "129:02", "why people believe that the heat of jet", "129:03", "engines which causes these artificial", "129:05", "clouds when it interacts with", "129:06", "condensation in the atmosphere and", "129:08", "creates", "129:08", "you know it creates artificial clouds", "129:10", "you see contrails yes some people", "129:12", "believe that", "129:12", "these are that someone's spraying", "129:15", "something", "129:16", "and that this weather control from these", "129:19", "commercial jets that", "129:20", "they're you know somehow there's this", "129:22", "gigantic conspiracy", "129:23", "of all these people involved and that", "129:25", "this is in some way", "129:28", "uh they're they're either doing weather", "129:30", "control or they're controlling us", "129:33", "or mind control it depends on who you", "129:34", "ask and clearly", "129:36", "but mick had a really interesting way of", "129:38", "discussing it okay and one of the things", "129:39", "that he said is this is like the", "129:40", "training wheels for conspiracy theory", "129:42", "because you see it in the sky like look", "129:44", "there it is i don't remember that you", "129:45", "know there's photographs from", "129:46", "world war ii where you can see from the", "129:48", "1940s you can see contrails in the sky", "129:50", "that look just like the ones up here", "129:52", "but people will say i don't remember", "129:53", "those when we were kids and people go", "129:55", "yeah yeah i don't", "129:56", "and then it starts fueling this paranoid", "129:58", "idea that there's this program going on", "130:01", "and then there are real programs that", "130:03", "the government is considering", "130:05", "to combat global warming where they", "130:07", "talked about this in the in the 70s and", "130:09", "the 80s", "130:10", "they talked about reflective particles", "130:12", "in the atmosphere", "130:13", "i think they were when they were", "130:14", "concerned that the ozone layer was beat", "130:16", "minimum was the 80s probably later than", "130:18", "that but even more recently they've", "130:20", "talked about", "130:22", "suspending reflective particles in the", "130:23", "atmosphere to protect it but it'd be", "130:25", "very different", "130:26", "but why do people believe conspiracy", "130:28", "theories what", "130:29", "is it in the nature of certain people", "130:31", "that that i'm just so fascinated by it", "130:33", "that's a good question that's what i was", "130:35", "going to ask you i don't know", "130:36", "what do you when you see it from the", "130:38", "outside when you see something like uh", "130:42", "like the most horrific ones like sandy", "130:44", "hook", "130:45", "like sandy hook being a false flag what", "130:47", "would be the motivation", "130:49", "for someone saying that what would be", "130:51", "the motivation", "130:54", "the only thing i can i mean the most", "130:56", "plausible i guess would be", "131:00", "capturing an audience like getting", "131:02", "people to believe in you as some", "131:04", "seer behind the veil yeah but that's", "131:07", "only the people that are projecting this", "131:09", "in terms of in in the media i'm talking", "131:11", "about like alex jones like why does he", "131:13", "say that", "131:14", "my question is why do other people think", "131:16", "it why do they look for it", "131:18", "not not a person who's profiting i think", "131:20", "that's i think the reason people look to", "131:22", "conspiracy theories is that", "131:24", "the world is", "131:29", "deeply chaotic and seems to lack", "131:33", "a logic and people are desperate", "131:36", "for a system of understanding the world", "131:39", "and conspiracy theories often", "131:42", "seem to like offer a very very actually", "131:46", "like an incredibly simplistic", "131:47", "explanation", "131:48", "which is there's this secret thing like", "131:50", "there's always a secret thing", "131:52", "that is a plan that the public doesn't", "131:54", "know about the real thing is that no one", "131:56", "really is at the wheel",
