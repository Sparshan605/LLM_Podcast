fucked him up and", "96:48", "stopped him that was a beating what", "96:50", "round was that it was a second saying", "96:52", "was a second he barely made it out of", "96:54", "the first right yeah I barely made it I", "96:56", "mean he got fucked up from the get-go", "96:58", "and Connor just had his numbers way", "97:00", "faster way quicker in like covering", "97:02", "distance just just like

and the fight Conor", "97:11", "McGregor and he just got fucked up I", "97:13", "kind of had his hands behind his back", "97:15", "and standing right in front of him and", "97:17", "then popping him in the face like that", "97:18", "was ugly so that you know like what year", "97:22", "was that those 500 those 500 days ago", "97:26", "like that's that kind of fight is a", "97:29", "great fight for Conor but that's all", "97:32", "hammer when he fought Nate he had to be", "97:34", "the nail through a lot of that yeah the", "97:37", "whole fucking second round of the first", "97:40", "fight when Nate got him down was the", "97:41", "second round submission right wasn't it", "97:43", "I don't know when he submitted him but", "97:46", "Nate's submit him in the second round", "97:47", "what are you looking at me funny woman", "97:49", "you got something these foot pull up", "97:51", "more than I do with my deck", "97:52", "that's what Conor said these fools pull", "97:55", "out more than I do with my dick I'm like", "97:57", "how he had specified with he must have", "97:59", "only pulled out four times max that's", "98:02", "not that great the fights with Nate were", "98:05", "fights you know he had a dig deep and he", "98:07", "lost the first one he got beat up he got", "98:09", "taken down he got his back taken he got", "98:11", "choked he tapped I mean he fucking lost",

got", "98:23", "and walk away he's gotta walk away", "98:24", "because he's too tired he can't engage", "98:25", "right now okay so he walked away a", "98:27", "couple times in those exchanges those", "98:29", "were Digg Digg fights what's this buddy", "98:32", "round two yeah yeah yeah okay", "98:35", "submission rear naked choke four minutes", "98:37", "and 12 seconds it around - yeah he beat", "98:39", "him down warm down and then stopped him", "98:41", "that's and the fight that Conard one", "98:44", "could that have gone either yeah", "98:46", "arguments right that's very close fight", "98:48", "and very close match I think in the new", "98:51", "rules Conor probably would have won", "98:53", "because I think look I think even just a", "98:57", "one knockdowns not good enough for a", "98:59", "10-8 round it's just not you know in a", "99:01", "five minute round like one knockdown", "99:03", "it's it's depends on how the other", "99:05", "exchanges were going the exchanges were", "99:07", "all the same then you cracked him once", "99:08", "you definitely won but did you win ten a", "99:11", "like ten eight is a beatdown I think you", "99:14", "know yeah but even I think that should", "99:15", "be wrong I don't think it should be that", "99:16", "I think should be like a hundred points", "99:18", "yeah and I think they should have like", "99:20", "scores for like one through ten in", "99:22", "striking one through ten and wrestling", "99:24", "one through ten with it or", "99:25", "non-applicable if there's no wrestling", "99:27", "at all you just eat ten but you got to", "99:29", "look at it this way though if if you", "99:31", "could have a fight", "99:32", "and in one round it's super close and", "99:35", "really nothing happened and super close", "99:38", "and no one really connected anything and", "99:40", "that happens all the time", "99:41", "that's a 10-9 round right should and", "99:45", "then you you compare that to another", "99:47", "round where a guy got dropped but it was", "99:50", "kind of a flash knockdown he pops back", "99:52", "up and then they then it's kind of even", "99:54", "for the rest of the round that can't be", "99:55", "a 10-9 - so either you got to make more", "99:58", "10 10 rounds or nine nine rounds and", "100:01", "then you could say okay a knockdown", "100:03", "doesn't necessarily mean ten eight", "100:05", "because then at ten nine is gonna mean", "100:06", "one dude clearly won and landed some", "100:09", "good shots", "100:10", "that's a 10-9 right it's all how you you", "100:13", "lay it down so if
