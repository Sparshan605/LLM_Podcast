that the testing is far", "119:47", "superior now so you're able to pick up", "119:50", "these metabolites in much much smaller", "119:52", "quantities okay this is so this test is", "119:55", "from December 9th", "119:57", "yes I want to see what his test was", "120:00", "leading up to that apparently was clean", "120:03", "before that he said we were notified", "120:04", "early this month of an issue he has had", "120:07", "over his most recent tests where a very", "120:08", "small amount of fact described how small", "120:10", "it is of a long-term metabolite", "120:14", "substance called d

he's cheating again I get that", "120:52", "you would think that but I don't know if", "120:54", "that's true and if it's not true it", "120:57", "would be a shame to accuse him of it if", "120:59",

there's a shit ton of a mouth", "122:46", "there man", "122:47", "you can get a lot of stuff in these", "122:49", "system but then there's also people that", "122:51", "are taking steroids so how do you know", "122:53", "who to the only way to find out who's", "122:55", "who is don't take shit don't take", "122:57", "anything unless his third-party test it", "122:59", "don't think anything

"know what the levels of that drug they", "123:19", "found were before December 9 it takes a", "123:22", "long time I understand so but every time", "123:25", "you urine the level should get lower and", "123:28", "lower and lower I think what they're", "123:31", "saying is this is the lowest detectable", "123:33", "number so so lower than them so they", "123:36", "should have found this before maybe this", "123:39", "higher maybe not depending the did see", "123:42", "these numbers the way it's been", "123:44", "explained to me again I'm not a fucking", "123:45", "scientist but the way it's been", "123:47", "explained to me this number is so small", "123:49", "that it could conceivably be tested in", "123:52", "one test and not tested another test and", "123:54", "then also as the
