exactly to your", "03:02", "point you just don't feel like it's a", "03:04", "refreshing sort of deep sleep yeah it", "03:07", "feels totally different um it just feels", "03:10", "like I guess I would say it feels like", "03:12", "half asleep yeah it's really kind of", "03:14", "does feel yeah one of the things that I", "03:17", "noticed I did this thing with my friends", "03:19", "called sober October where we didn't", "03:22", "smoke any pot or do any no drinking at", "03:25", "all nothing for a month and when I did", "03:28", "it one of the things I found was that", "03:30", "after about I don't know how many days", "03:33", "but it was noticeable that I would have", "03:35", "these incredibly vivid dreams and then I", "03:38", "had read that marijuana does something", "03:41", "to suppress heavy REM sleep like what", "03:45", "what is happening there yeah so both of", "03:47", "those chemicals both of which it used as", "03:49", "a sleep aid alcohol and marijuana are", "03:52", "actually very good at blocking your", "03:53", "dream sleep your rapid eye movement", "03:55", "sleep and so what happens is that the", "03:57", "brain is quite clever in this regard it", "04:00", "builds up a clock counter of how much", "04:02", "dream sleep you should have had but have", "04:05", "not been getting and it starts to", "04:07", "develop this increasing appetite and", "04:09", "hunger for dream sleep so that finally", "04:12", "when the alcohol actually gets out of", "04:14", "your system sober October over the name", "04:17", "that's all of a sudden where you get", "04:19", "what's called a REM sleep rebound effect", "04:21", "where you not only get the normal amount", "04:24", "of REM sleep that you would normally", "04:25", "have", "04:26", "get that plus the brain tries to get", "04:28", "back some of that dream sleep that it's", "04:30", "been losing over the past maybe 11 11", "04:33", "months so you get this 20 years serum so", "04:41", "you get this REM sleep rebounded effect", "04:42", "and that's where you have these really", "04:43", "intense dream sleep situations yeah the", "04:47", "same reason that people will they'll say", "04:49", "like I had a bit too much to drink last", "04:51", "night maybe it was a Friday or Saturday", "04:52", "they sleep in late they say I just had", "04:54", "these crazy dreams mmm what happens", "04:57", "there is a kind of an acute version", "04:59", "where the alcohol is swirling around in", "05:01", "your system and after about six hours", "05:04", "your liver and your kidneys have finally", "05:06", "excreted all of the alcohol and your", "05:09", "brain has been deprived of dream sleep", "05:11", "for that first six hours so then it", "05:13", "feasts in the last couple of hours and", "05:15", "that's why you have these really bizarre", "05:17", "dreams after you've been drinking a", "05:19", "little bit too much oh wow so but what", "05:22", "is happening with marijuana though", "05:23", "specifically do you know yeah so", "05:26", "marijuana it does help people will help", "05:30", "it it puts people to sleep quicker", "05:32", "although I think that the question is", "05:35", "whether it's really natural istic sleep", "05:37", "or not that they go into certainly with", "05:38", "alcohol it's not that nightcap idea is", "05:42", "is a misnomer alcohol will actually well", "05:45", "it's a form of drugs that we call the", "05:46", "sedatives and sedation is not sleep it's", "05:49", "very different but we often mistake one", "05:51", "for the other marijuana it seems to act", "05:54", "in a physiologically very different way", "05:56", "it doesn't target the same receptors in", "05:58", "the brain so it's unclear whether this", "06:00", "speed with which you fall asleep after", "06:03", "having a session with marijuana is", "06:04", "actually natural sleep let's assume it", "06:06", "is the problem however is that it then", "06:09", "will start to disrupt REM sleep it will", "06:12", "start to block the process we think", "06:14", "perhaps at the level of the brainstem", "06:16", "which is were these two types of sleep", "06:18", "non REM and REM sleep will actually get", "06:20", "sort of worked out that's where", "06:22", "marijuana may actually impact dream", "06:24", "sleep and shut it down and block it have", "06:26", "there been any Studies on chronic", "06:28", "marijuana smokers like those", "06:30", "dawn-to-dusk type characters that just", "06:32", "are constantly high like and what", "06:34", "happens to their brain from not because", "06:36", "they must never hit REM sleep he", "06:39", "so people haven't looked at marijuana", "06:41", "they have looked at alcohol though mmm", "06:44", "exactly that so what happens is if you", "06:46", "look at alcoholics they will have", "06:49", "something often when they come off", "06:51", "alcohol something called delirium", "06:53", "tremens which is where the sort of DT", "06:56", "there what happens is that the alcohol", "06:59", "has been blocking dream sleep for so", "07:01", "long and the pressure for dream sleep is", "07:04", "built up so powerfully in the brain it", "07:06", "actually just spills over into", "07:08", "wakefulness and so the brain just says", "07:11", "look okay if I'm not going to get this", "07:13", "dream sleep whilst you're asleep I'm", "07:15", "just going to take it whilst you're", "07:16", "awake and so you start to essentially", "07:18", "dream while you're awake it's this sort", "07:21", "of collision of two states of", "07:22", "consciousness so you get delirium Wow I", "07:26", "always thought the DTS were detoxing", "07:28", "other when someone said someone's going", "07:30", "through those three T's okay yeah so", "07:31", "it's delirium tremor yeah delirium", "07:33", "tremens yeah I'm sort of mmm so what", "07:36", "like what is going on with them when", "07:38", "this is happening so if they are going", "07:40", "through this delirium during the day", "07:42", "while they're conscious what what's", "07:44", "physiologically happening so it's almost", "07:47", "as though the veil of REM sleep gets", "07:49", "pulled over the waking brain as it were", "07:52", "so you have this mixed state of", "07:53", "consciousness that you can pick up with", "07:55", "brainwave recordings and it just tells", "07:58", "me I mean in some ways how necessary", "08:02", "sleep must be if that's the lengths that", "08:05", "the brain will go to to get that which", "08:07", "it's been missing you know just shows", "08:10", "you why you know it took mother nature's", "08:12", "3.6 million years to put this thing", "08:14", "called any tower sleep necessity in", "08:17", "place and we've come along and within", "08:19", "the space of a hundred years we've", "08:20", "lopped off almost 20% of that if you", "08:22", "look at the data Wow really yeah and so", "08:27", "many people take pride in that too I", "08:28", "don't need a tower sleep", "08:30", "I got three I'm good ready to go kick", "08:32", "ass and dominate the world yeah yeah", "08:34", "it's the sort of like sleep machismo", "08:36", "attitude there's a lot of that right", "08:38", "yeah it's me baby I like sleep well I", "08:41", "mean you'd be glad to know that then you", "08:44", "know men who sleep five to six hours a", "08:46", "night will have a level of testosterone", "08:47", "which is that of someone ten years their", "08:50", "senior", "08:51", "hmm so a less tough sleep will aid you", "08:53", "by a decade in terms of the critical", "08:55", "aspect of wellness virility muscle", "08:58", "strength years that's incredible", "09:00", "Wow we had a woman on the podcast her", "09:04", "name is Courtney de Walter and she's a", "09:06", "ultra marathon runner and she ran she's", "09:09", "a real freak I mean like an incredible", "09:12", "athlete", "09:12", "she ran this thing called the Moab 240", "09:16", "its 238 miles through the the Moab", "09:20", "mountains and she did it 22 miles faster", "09:25", "than the second place man", "09:27", "so she wanted by like a whopping I think", "09:30", "it was ten hours ten hours ahead of the", "09:33", "second place winner and she slept one", "09:36", "minute one minute the entire time she", "09:39", "tried to lie to this over three days I", "09:40", "think it took her less than three days", "09:42", "thing took her like two days she slept", "09:47", "for one minute during the entire time", "09:50", "but she tried to lie down she said she", "09:52", "laid down for a few minutes but she", "09:54", "couldn't fall asleep and then she wound", "09:56", "up actually just taking one minute and", "09:58", "going to sleep and she said that one", "10:00", "minute was like one of the most intense", "10:02", "restful minutes after that minute is", "10:04", "over she was woken up cuz she told her", "10:06", "partner a running partner to wake her up", "10:08", "at a minute and she's like how long did", "10:10", "you let me sleep and he was like one", "10:12", "minute she's like wow I feel great let's", "10:14", "go but she was saying that she", "10:15", "hallucinates and that she starts seeing", "10:18", "like rabbits or talking to her and she", "10:19", "sees things that aren't there and like", "10:22", "mystical beings and stuff she said it's", "10:24", "really freaky but she knows that she's", "10:27", "hallucinating because she's done this", "10:29", "she's done a bunch of ultra marathons so", "10:31", "she just keeps going she just keeps", "10:32", "going and she's like saying hi to", "10:34", "rabbits they're talking orange stuff", "10:35", "yeah I mean and you you see these", "10:38", "reports too I mean there's a there's a", "10:39", "race of cycling race of things bike", "10:41", "across America you just got to go from", "10:43", "East Coast to west coast in a shorter", "10:45", "time as possible and that's exactly what", "10:47", "they do to it's all about managing how", "10:49", "little sleep that you get and they will", "10:51", "explain these wild hallucinogenic", "10:53", "experiences on the bike if you look at", "10:56", "world records for people who have tried", "10:59", "to sort of go without sleep and one of", "11:01", "the most famous examples is a radio disc", "11:03", "jockey called Peter", "11:05", "trip back in the news back in the sort", "11:08", "of 60s 50s 60s and he tried to break the", "11:12", "world record he went eight days straight", "11:14", "and yeah no sleep yeah he was", "11:17", "broadcasting from Times Square", "11:19", "and he would do his show there and you", "11:22", "know the scientists the psychiatrist", "11:23", "said look this is a very bad idea based", "11:25", "on what we know please don't do it and", "11:26", "he said I'm gonna do it anyway and then", "11:28", "the scientists being the good scientists", "11:30", "they said great Jemaine if we study you", "11:31", "could it'd be a great paper to sort of", "11:33", "you know to write up and they tracked", "11:35", "him and by day three he was having", "11:38", "florid delusions and

we slept last night we came", "12:14", "flagrantly psychotic when we went into", "12:16", "dream sleep because you start to see", "12:19", "things which are not there so you", "12:20", "hallucinate

woke up this morning", "12:39", "and we forgot most if not all of that", "12:40", "dream experience so we're suffering from", "12:42", "amnesia what is happening when you're", "12:46", "having these hallucinogenic experiences", "12:50", "like what are the chemicals that are", "12:52", "causing it do we know we do it yeah and", "12:54", "we so we've done some of these studies", "12:55", "where we put people into brain scanners", "12:57", "we let them fall asleep and then we see", "13:00", "what happens within the brain which", "13:01", "parts of the brain is switching on which", "13:03",

country but what's also", "13:25", "interesting is that not all parts of the", "13:26", "brain ramped up when you go into REM", "13:28", "sleep visual parts of the brain increase", "13:31", "motor parts of the brain increase", "13:33", "emotional centers and memory centers", "13:35", "they all increase but the part of the", "13:37", "brain that bucks the trend and goes in", "13:39", "the opposite direction is the part of", "13:42", "the brain that we call the prefrontal", "13:43", "cortex this sort of CEO of the brain", "13:46", "that's very good at rational logical", "13:48",

we", "14:26", "forget why do we forget those dreams", "14:29", "because I I wake up and I am sure that", "14:32", "I'm gonna remember these dreams and", "14:33", "sometimes I do sometimes I remember and", "14:36", "I don't think I really remember them I", "14:38", "think what it is is very much like you", "14:41", "ever hears someone talk about a memory", "14:44", "from a long time ago", "14:45", "I used to think that people actually", "14:47", "remembered things from a long time ago", "14:49", "but now what I think is they remember", "14:52", "remembering it mmm I think they remember", "14:54", "talking about it they remember how they", "14:57", "described it and then they sort of", "14:59", "remember that and repeat it and in their", "15:02", "mind convinced themselves that that's", "15:04", "what happened because I've heard people", "15:05", "tell stories about the past and they're", "15:09", "they vary wildly from what is absolutely", "15:13", "true like like factual you could check", "15:16", "it you could research it you know what", "15:18", "the facts are but in their mind it's", "15:20", "very different and I think that it's", "15:22", "entirely possible that what people are", "15:24", "doing is remembering the recollection of", "15:28", "these memories and how they told them", "15:30", "and then also sort of people", "15:32", "library things that makes themselves", "15:33", "look better or make the situation look", "15:35", "more dramatic but with dreams that", "15:39", "doesn't make any sense so I was I'm", "15:41", "always trying to figure out like what is", "15:43", "it about a dream where sometimes I can", "15:45", "remember the dream and sometimes it's so", "15:49", "vivid when I wake up I'm like holy shit", "15:51", "that was crazy what a dream and then I", "15:53", "forget 20 minutes later right what is", "15:55", "that", "15:56", "so firstly I mean one theory of dreaming", "15:58", "is that it's just simply a", "16:00", "reconstruction when you wake up so you", "16:02", "have these fragments of activity and", "16:04", "what your cortex does when it wakes up", "16:06", "is what your cortex is designed to do", "16:07", "when you're awake normally which is try", "16:09", "to package everything can make a good", "16:11", "story make logical fit out of the world", "16:13", "that's one theory I don't believe that", "16:16", "though you your point is a very", "16:19", "interesting one do I remember my dreams", "16:22", "that doesn't necessarily mean I forget", "16:25", "my dreams and what I mean by that is", "16:28", "accessibility versus availability so if", "16:31", "you haven't had that experience where", "16:33", "you've woken up you thought I was", "16:35", "definitely dreaming I can't quite grab", "16:37", "it you know it just and it's gone mm-hmm", "16:39", "and then two days later you're in the", "16:40", "shower you said of washing yourself you", "16:42", "see a bottle of shampoo you see the", "16:44", "label and it just triggers the unlocking", "16:47", "of that dream memory and it sort of", "16:48", "comes flooding back or someone says", "16:51", "something to you you think oh that was", "16:53", "the dream yeah what that tells me as a", "16:55", "brain scientist is that the memory is", "16:58", "there it's preserved it's available but", "17:01", "what happens when most of the time when", "17:03", "we wake up is that we lose the IP", "17:05", "address to the memory so it's present", "17:08", "but it's not consciously accessible", "17:10", "available not accessible if that's true", "17:13", "what it means is that this type of", "17:16", "information we know can have", "17:18", "non-conscious impacts on our behavior", "17:20", "all the time there's great brain science", "17:22", "about this non conscious memory", "17:24", "processing it's possible that we store", "17:27", "every one of our dreams we just don't", "17:30", "consciously have accessibility to it but",

you", "18:52", "go into dream sleep is radically", "18:54", "different yeah so one of the chemicals", "18:56", "called noradrenaline in the brain which", "18:58", "downstairs in the body it's sister",

"signature of that maze so it goes but", "31:22", "but but bum bum bum bum what was amazing", "31:25", "is that when you let those rats sleep", "31:27", "but you keep listening to the brain what", "31:30", "you hear is as if the brain is actually", "31:35", "and in fact it is it's replaying the", "31:37", "exact same sequence they memory sequence", "31:41", "that it was learning whilst it was awake", "31:42", "its replaying but at a speed that is 20", "31:45", "times faster Wow so you know now we", "31:49", "start to get into this Inception world", "31:50", "and I don't mean to because the", "31:52", "scientific data it really that we're not", "31:53", "sort of in that territory but you know", "31:55", "that notion of time compression and time", "31:59", "dilation that Christopher

what you're saying", "32:08", "which is that the better that they", "32:11", "rehearse those skilled memories when you", "32:14", "wake them up and test them the next day", "32:16", "that predicts how much better they are", "32:19", "in terms of their performance so it's", "32:22", "not just that you learn you go to sleep", "32:24", "and you replay and you hit the Save", "32:25", "button on these

performance and practice does", "32:37", "not make perfect practice with a night", "32:39", "of sleep is what makes perfect because", "32:42", "you come back the next day and you're 20", "32:44", "to 30% better in terms of you're skilled", "32:47", "performance than where you were at the", "32:49", "end of your practice session the day", "32:51", "before Wow I mean sleep is the greatest", "32:56", "legal performance-enhancing drug that", "32:58", "most people are probably neglecting in", "33:00", "sport Wow and not just for your physical", "33:03", "performance but actually skill learning", "33:05", "that's right skill learning memory and", "33:07", "then also you know downstairs in the", "33:09", "body all over the recuperative benefits", "33:11", "and you can flip the coin by the way if", "33:14", "you're getting six hours of sleep or", "33:15", "less your time to fizz", "33:18", "exhaustion drops by up to 30%", "33:21", "so you could spend all of your time", "33:23", "training for a 10-round fight perfect", "33:27", "condition but then I put you on six", "33:28", "hours of sleep the night before you're", "33:30", "now gonna be physically exhausted by", "33:32", "round seven rather than round ten Wow", "33:34", "but well that's a really hard thing for", "33:36", "fighter because they have a very", "33:37", "difficult time sleeping the night before", "33:39", "a big fight yeah it's very very", "33:41", "difficult cuz usually pretty and yep and", "33:43", "I would imagine it's got to be I mean", "33:48", "it's probably got to take a huge toll", "33:50", "and is probably a huge benefit if they", "33:52", "can somehow or another bypass all that", "33:55", "and just relax and learn how to relax", "33:57", "and learn how to actually sleep I mean", "33:59", "it's I think you know it's one of what", "34:01", "constantly trying to hack the", "34:03", "physiological system especially in elite", "34:05", "sports these days because you know small", "34:07", "fractions of a percent of gain can make", "34:09", "a huge difference well that sounds like", "34:11", "36 a monster huge yeah I mean your time", "34:14", "to get if not just physically exhausting", "34:16", "but you know the lactic acid builds up", "34:18", "quicker the less and less that you sleep", "34:19", "your ability of the lungs to actually", "34:22", "expire carbon dioxide and inhale oxygen", "34:25",

"34:34", "also doing another television show and I", "34:36", "was doing jujitsu I was never got a", "34:38", "two-hour sleep I mostly got for usually", "34:40", "got four and my cardio always sucked", "34:42", "yeah who is terrible and I'd be like why", "34:45", "is my cardio suck I workout so much like", "34:47", "that was probably what it was yeah it's", "34:49", "a huge pot now how many hours of sleep", "34:52", "should you get somewhere between", "34:54", "excuse me somewhere between 7 to 9 hours", "34:57", "once you get below 7 hours of sleep we", "35:00", "can measure objective impairments in", "35:02", "your brain in your body I can show that", "35:05", "in the last two days and I can share it", "35:08", "show it because I basically did the same", "35:09", "workout two days in a row the day before", "35:12", "I had flown back from Boston very tired", "35:16", "hang out with my kids all day went to", "35:20", "get some sleep but then I had to do some", "35:22", "stuff at

alarm went off at", "35:34", "8:00 so my my sleep was like 3-4 hours", "35:37", "it was all screwy and the night before I", "35:39", "was even less because I had flown and I", "35:41", "had to get up early for the flight and I", "35:42", "tried to sleep on the plane and I went", "35:44", "running and I felt like dogs shed yeah", "35:46", "and then during the day I felt like dog", "35:47", "shit I just didn't have like as I was", "35:49", "running I just didn't have any extra", "35:51", "gear I was like I did it I pushed", "35:54", "through it but then it was over I was", "35:56", "like oh well last night last night I", "35:58", "slept seven and a half hours woke up", "36:01", "today lifted weights ran ran felt great", "36:04", "feel great now like two days in", "36:07", "difference I mean that's the difference", "36:08", "the difference is one day I got real", "36:10", "sleep one day I didn't I did the exact", "36:12", "same thing even more today I did I", "36:14", "lifted weights today as well and I just", "36:16", "feel great so I could see I could see it", "36:18", "physiologically in the difference in my", "36:21", "performance in 24 hours", "36:23", "yeah and that's

combination of", "37:17", "those things", "37:18", "is it exhaustion causing you to misstep", "37:20", "perhaps and like twist an ankle or to", "37:23", "turn a knee yeah it's all of those", "37:25",

the things that sleep actually", "40:39", "accomplishes here I was talking about", "40:40", "those 20 to 30% benefits in motor school", "40:43", "performance so we did some additional", "40:45",

"49:04", "yeah", "49:04", "but then when you come into the home you", "49:06", "know the invasion of light into the home", "49:08", "by way of Technology has been a big", "49:10", "problem people looking at their phones", "49:12", "before they go to vote well first the", "49:13", "yeah I mean the incandescent light bulb", "49:15", "sort of was the start of it and light", "49:18", "bulbs can suppress a hormone that's", "49:20", "called melatonin it's the hormone of", "49:21", "darkness and it tells your brain when", "49:23", "it's dark and when it's time to sleep", "49:25", "but then you add into that screen usage", "49:29", "and they've done studies were for", "49:31", "example you know one hour of iPad", "49:34", "reading versus just one hour of reading", "49:36", "on a book you

hours delayed it's 50% less in", "49:58", "terms of its peak and furthermore you", "50:01", "don't get the same amount of REM sleep", "50:03", "and when you wake up the next morning", "50:05", "you don't feel as refreshed or restored", "50:07", "by your sleep those studies have been", "50:09", "done - Wow what should someone do if", "50:14", "they have a hard time sleeping like say", "50:16",

"50:24", "yeah there are there strategies there", "50:26", "are I mean I think for most people there", "50:28", "are five things that you can do just out", "50:30", "the gate to get better sleep regularity", "50:33", "is probably the most important thing I", "50:34", "can tell you go to bed at the same time", "50:36", "wake up at the same time no matter", "50:38", "whether it's the weekend weekday", "50:40", "regularity is key we've spoken about", "50:43", "light for example when you in the last", "50:46", "hour before bed try to stay away from", "50:48", "screens but also just switch off half", "50:50", "the lights in the house you would be", "50:52", "surprised at how sup errific that is it", "50:55", "really starts to sort of make you feel a", "50:57", "bit more drowsy they've done some great", "50:59", "studies where they would take people out", "51:00", "you know into the Rockies no electric", "51:03", "light no electricity whatsoever", "51:06", "and they started to go to bed two hours", "51:08", "earlier than the acclaimed natural", "51:10", "bedtime wasn't just because they didn't", "51:12", "have anything necessarily to do it was", "51:14", "that their melatonin was rising you know", "51:17", "two hours earlier so keep it dark", "51:20", "the third is probably keep it cool your", "51:23", "brain actually needs to drop its", "51:25", "temperature by about two to three", "51:26", "degrees Fahrenheit to initiate sleep hmm", "51:29", "and that's the reason that you will", "51:31", "always find it easier to fall asleep in", "51:33", "a room that's too cold than too hot I've", "51:36", "seen people use cold pads yeah she knows", "51:38", "you sleep on these cold pads were", "51:40", "younger those yeah I mean their evidence", "51:42", "is pretty good that cooling the body", "51:44", "actually works they've you know in the", "51:47", "book I write about a series of studies", "51:49", "where they had people in it's almost", "51:51", "like a wetsuit but it has all of these", "51:54", "veins running through it and they could", "51:57", "actually perfuse warm or cold water into", "52:00", "any part of the body hands core of the", "52:03", "body feet and so that you could", "52:06", "exquisitely manipulate the temperature", "52:08", "of any part of the body and what they", "52:11", "found is that they could effectively", "52:13", "cool the body down and it", "52:15", "instantaneously made people fall asleep", "52:18", "faster and it gave them deeper deep non", "52:21", "REM sleep that sort of restorative sleep", "52:23", "for the body so and you can even look at", "52:26", "studies where people sleep semi-naked", "52:28", "and that also seems to improve their", "52:31", "sleep and they get a little bit more", "52:32", "deep sleep too so cold is better the", "52:37", "paradox here though is that you need to", "52:39", "warm your feet and your hands to kind of", "52:42", "charm the blood away from your core out", "52:45", "to the

it's actually a little different", "55:12", "than the idea of to sleep so there was a", "55:15", "time in sort of the Dickensian era where", "55:18", "people would sleep for the first half of",

know from the data you will", "58:39", "be both dead sooner and the quality of", "58:41", "that now shorter life will be", "58:42", "significantly worse", "58:44", "yeah that's counterintuitive to people", "58:46", "the idea that you need this it's not", "58:50", "just like you're making best use of time", "58:53", "by sleeping less you're not you you", "58:55", "would make best use of time by being", "58:57", "awake less exactly which is crazy", "59:00", "I mean wakefulness firstly from a brain", "59:02", "perspective is a low-level brain damage", "59:03", "we know that wakefulness is yeah

more you eat more of the wrong", "61:45", "things hmm so if and this the great", "61:48", "scientific work if you give people this", "61:50", "sort of finger buffet and they can eat", "61:53",

you", "64:53", "out but I could also just know when I'm", "64:55", "going into a state of you know sleep", "64:57", "debt and I could build up some credit", "64:59", "and there's precedent for this by the", "65:01", "way there is a system like that in the", "65:04", "brain it's called the fat cell because", "65:06", "there were times during our evolutionary", "65:09", "past where we faced famine

that Tim Ferriss when", "97:45", "he was writing his book the 4-hour body", "97:46", "he didn't want to include it anyone", "97:49", "include this particular drug because he", "97:52", "felt like

one of the interesting things is", "98:02", "that if you look at the the profile of", "98:06", "what sleep deprivation is cognitively", "98:07", "you know reduced alertness impulsivity", "98:10",
