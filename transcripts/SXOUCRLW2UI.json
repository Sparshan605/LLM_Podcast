"33:49", "be addressed right the health care of", "33:50", "soldiers needs to be addressed reform of", "33:52", "the police reform of these communities", "33:53", "like it has to be addressed if you're", "33:55", "going to spend trillions of dollars to", "33:57", "bail out these large corporations you", "34:00", "got to you've got to work on these other", "34:02", "problems too you can't just ignore them", "34:04", "because they're not the ones who are", "34:06", "funding your campaign and that's that", "34:09", "that's a huge issue and that's the thing", "34:10", "that's gotta stop look at it in 2008", "34:12", "right so we have this enormous economic", "34:16", "collapse in 2008 housing market sinks", "34:19", "and these derivative mortgage things go", "34:23", "down and the world economy grinds to a", "34:26", "halt thousands of people lose a job", "34:29", "foreclosures all over the place so they", "34:31", "come in and they pump billions of", "34:34", "dollars into the organizations that sunk", "34:39", "the fucking ship in the first place yeah", "34:41", "that's where the money goes and I", "34:43", "remember asking the Treasury secretary", "34:46", "at the time you know this is a mortgage", "34:49", "question right because they the", "34:50", "derivatives made it like the geometric", "34:52", "pump so if they're bundling mortgages", "34:54", "and eight percent of those mortgages go", "34:56", "underwater it syncs the derivatives", "34:58", "market which is trillions of dollars as", "35:00", "opposed to billions of dollars so I said", "35:03", "you know with all that money what if you", "35:06", "just made those mortgages that were", "35:08", "underwater home", "35:11", "because the moment you do that doesn't", "35:13", "that fix your derivative problem don't", "35:15", "you haven't you just made and plus then", "35:18", "people get to keep their houses and what", "35:21", "he said to me was you can't do that", "35:23", "because of moral hazard huh", "35:26", "so moral hazard is a theory that you", "35:30", "can't incentivize bad behavior so what", "35:32", "he's saying is the people that took out", "35:34", "mortgages on their homes that went", "35:37", "underwater", "35:38", "that's their fault so you can't bail", "35:43", "them out because that would be sending a", "35:46", "hazardous message morally about the", "35:51", "economy so I said what's the moral", "35:55", "hazard then get making the people that", "35:59", "actually blew up the economy poll again", "36:02", "what's that how is that not moral hazard", "36:05", "and he said the plane was on fire and we", "36:09", "had to land why would they play they", "36:13", "were the ones who lit the plane on fire", "36:15", "how are you you're rewarding them for", "36:18", "that yeah yeah it's I've heard both", "36:22", "sides of that argument I've heard the", "36:24", "argument that nope nothing's too big to", "36:26", "fail let it fail and then I've heard the", "36:29", "argument that if it did feel fail would", "36:31", "be so catastrophic but I'm saying it", "36:33", "wouldn't have failed so it was a failure", "36:35", "because they oh yeah yeah they did it", "36:38", "all to themselves but if you made the", "36:40", "mortgages at the base of that okay so", "36:43", "let's say 10% of the mortgages are", "36:45", "underwater but you know so let's say you", "36:47", "had a $200,000 mortgage and now the", "36:49", "house is only worth hundred and fifty", "36:51", "thousand dollars so instead of given a", "36:53", "million dollars to AIG at the top give", "36:56", "$50,000 to that mortgage bring it into", "36:58", "line with its value suddenly that things", "37:00", "not underwater anymore it's like putting", "37:03", "ballast into a ship that's sinking put", "37:05", "the ballast then the ship comes up", "37:07", "rather than just saying alright we'll", "37:09", "buy you another fucking chip that almost", "37:11", "seems too logical though that's right", "37:16", "that's kind of part of what's the", "37:17", "problem with all this that's a nice", "37:20", "that's more", "37:22", "I was just like I don't even know what's", "37:23", "doing that incentivizing bad behavior", "37:25", "doesn't count when you're the ones who", "37:27", "tanked the economy and it's not it's", "37:29", "like what you're talking about today", "37:31", "like if someone tried to say that these", "37:33", "small businesses that are going under", "37:34", "because of the kovat sanctions because", "37:36", "everybody's been locked down rather if", "37:37", "if those people need to pull themselves", "37:39", "up by their bootstraps it's a great", "37:40", "example why that analogy sucks cuz like", "37:43", "there's nothing to do man you can't work", "37:45", "there's nothing you like what do you", "37:47", "want them to do there's no opportunity", "37:50", "it's everything shut down if you go", "37:52", "under at this time", "37:53", "it's not your fault it's one of the rare", "37:55", "times it's on the government right now", "37:57", "here's something I could do that's like", "37:59", "again like it seems like a simple", "38:02", "solution which is like just suspend an", "38:05", "extent yeah so the country shut down", "38:07", "right what's people's oftentimes biggest", "38:09", "worry my rent or my mortgage yeah", "38:11", "suspend and extend you know what we're", "38:14", "gonna do a six-month suspend nobody is", "38:19", "gonna be and if the landlord's need to", "38:22", "be helped out that's where we'll

think it was a skill and you know", "49:04", "and like I said that's one of the", "49:06", "reasons when my early episodes suck so", "49:07", "bad there wasn't given any consideration", "49:10", "to the fact that people were listening", "49:11", "it was just fun we're just doing it for", "49:14", "ourselves and then along the way and in", "49:17", "this house he also speaks to the value",

was", "49:28", "and I took it to heart and I would think", "49:30", "about it I'll go okay I gotta consider", "49:32", "that people are listening to this this", "49:34", "isn't just what I want to say it's what", "49:36", "I want people to hear I know how I want", "49:38", "it just like stand up you wanted the", "49:40", "joke to easily enter into a person's", "49:42", "mind so it's so well written
