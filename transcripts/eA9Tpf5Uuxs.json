first of all I mean", "64:16", "I don't think and the left would give", "64:17", "him a heavy credit whatsoever if he did", "64:19", "you know do any of what was just", "64:21", "suggested there but second which is that", "64:23", "this is just the fundamental difference", "64:25", "conservative and liberal disposition", "64:26", "which is that there are some bad people", "64:28", "out there who you can show them as much", "64:30", "compassion as you want they're still", "64:32", "going to loot and fall they're still", "64:33", "gonna loot they're still going to", "64:34", "criminalize

the governor of the state of", "64:44", "New York refuses to call these if these", "64:46", "states and these like I said police not", "64:47", "the governor's the mayor so the mayor", "64:49", "and I think the government actually", "64:50", "wants to remove the may displace this is", "64:55", "the thing about may you know the", "64:57", "Minnesota the Minnesota police and and", "65:00", "all of that which is that they refused", "65:02", "out of political correctness in order to", "65:04", "crack down immediately upon people who", "65:06", "work the very small group of people who", "65:09", "are violent criminals that's what", "65:11", "allowed this thing to go national and", "65:13", "now people are and this is it's part of", "65:15", "our history we have done it before", "65:17", "and

should absolutely be knocked out", "65:35", "and this is the point which is where I", "65:37", "pointed to why they started to blame", "65:38", "Russians and white Nationals because", "65:39", "they realized this was going against", "65:41", "them they only view it as legitimate", "65:43", "whenever they're using force to quash", "65:45", "aside which is not which is that they", "65:48", "agree with and that they don't do it", "65:49", "whenever it's a political cause they do", "65:51", "but that thing is happening which is", "65:54", "right though which is the one second is", "65:56", "this is selective application of justice", "65:59", "and this is exactly what they're worried", "66:01", "about which is that I have a better idea", "66:02", "you enforce the rule of law and law and",

so", "66:15", "I think that's part of where the", "66:17", "breakdown in our views occurs because I", "66:19", "think it's fantasy", "66:21", "I think it's fantasy to a mad", "66:23", "that you could trust this president to", "66:27", "deploy force in a responsible way and", "66:30", "we've already seen that like that's not", "66:32", "it's not a debatable point because we've", "66:34", "already

the moment", "78:11", "that the stock market crashed it was", "78:13", "like here's four trillion dollars good", "78:15", "shot", "78:16", "so it just exposes that's that's part of", "78:18", "the
