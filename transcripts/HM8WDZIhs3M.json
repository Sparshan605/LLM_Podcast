were", "08:14", "convinced by some letter in the New", "08:16", "England Journal of Medicine that said", "08:18", "that oxycontin isn't addictive is absurd", "08:20", "these are all morphine

structurally and", "08:28", "pharmacologically and qualitatively", "08:30", "similar to morphine of course it's going", "08:32", "to be addictive and that in and of", "08:34", "itself isn't even a bad thing it should", "08:36", "be okay to give people addictive drugs", "08:37", "as well as long as everyone's aware of", "08:39", "the risks as long as they understand a", "08:41", "protocol to get off of it the you you", "08:43", "know there's so many people that get on", "08:46", "these things and then wind up taking", "08:48", "them far longer than they're supposed to", "08:50", "because it's

because people that", "09:03", "get back operations any anything where", "09:05", "they prescribe you high doses of opiates", "09:08", "it's a huge problem I know many many", "09:11", "people that have gotten hooked because", "09:12", "and in fact I should tell you that my", "09:14", "good friend Justin Ren his wife found", "09:16", "out about kratom because of you because", "09:18", "of your show he had a problem with his", "09:23", "shoulder got shoulder shoulder surgery", "09:25", "they put him on oxycontin's he was", "09:27", "fucked up on them and he was having a", "09:29", "really hard time getting off and having", "09:30", "the shakes really bad and kratom is the", "09:33", "only thing that got him off of it right", "09:35", "and that's not surprising I mean this", "09:36", "has been known for a very long time in", "09:38", "Thailand and that was actually the", "09:40", "reason that it was originally prohibited", "09:42", "I don't know if you're aware of that but", "09:43", "because the government taxed opium and", "09:46", "people started using kratom then they", "09:49", "made Crotona leaves not the right way to", "09:50", "say it because people say kratom yeah", "09:52", "you're the only one I've heard sacred", "09:53", "Tom people in it's a Thai word people in", "09:55", "Thailand call it critic so people in the", "09:58", "US call it kratom it's a it's also they", "10:01", "have you know is maybe it's a quick Tom", "10:03", "something I'm not gonna go that forever", "10:05", "Cree tom is close if you did it would be", "10:06", "weird but I feel as you know yeah", "10:11", "like American people that say Ecuador", "10:13", "hahahaha Argentina but it is Krita yeah", "10:17", "crow Tom okay so we'll try to call Chris", "10:19", "or something close to that it's closer", "10:20", "to that than kratom right and so the", "10:23", "reason why was made it illegal was", "10:24", "because of the fact that it was pinching", "10:26", "some of the profits off of the opium", "10:27", "trade yes Wow", "10:29", "yeah that's fucked up and so this has", "10:31", "been known for a long time that it helps", "10:33", "people get off more addictive opioids", "10:35", "and how does it do that well it's an", "10:37", "opioid itself and a lot of people don't", "10:39", "want to admit or acknowledge that but I", "10:41", "think we need to get beyond this idea", "10:42", "that drugs are inherently bad or opioids", "10:45", "are inherently bad just because the ones", "10:47", "that we're aware of have a lot of", "10:48", "problems you know in some sense", "10:51", "medicinal chemistry and pharmacology and", "10:53", "all this are still in a very primitive", "10:55", "state and there's so much to be learned", "10:57", "so we're mostly giving people these", "10:59", "derivatives of morphine that have been", "11:00", "around for a hundred years", "11:03", "and there are better things we're going", "11:05", "to continuously discover less addictive", "11:08", "treatments for pain and I think that the", "11:11", "alkaloids in kratom are a step in that", "11:14", "direction and which is so tragic that", "11:17", "they're trying to now make it illegal", "11:19", "because this is something that as far as", "11:22", "I can tell has genuinely helped an", "11:24", "enormous number of people reduce their", "11:26", "intake of more addictive and more", "11:28", "dangerous opioids one of the things that", "11:30", "I felt I mean and again my dose was not", "11:33", "extremely high but when I was on it I", "11:36", "was very coherent I was clear it was", "11:38", "clear to me that was affected by", "11:40", "something but it felt kind of good", "11:42", "it didn't feel bad it felt a little a", "11:46", "little uneasy like a little like whoa", "11:49", "this is what the world feels a little", "11:51", "weird right now", "11:51", "but it did not feel like I was impaired", "11:56", "like I know a lot of people who take it", "11:58", "and exercise like I have a friend he'll", "12:01", "take ten pills and exercise it just just", "12:05", "seems kind of fucking crazy yes but he", "12:07", "says he has a great workout right by", "12:10", "taking that stuff before he works out", "12:11", "yeah I mean it seems to lend itself to a", "12:13", "lot of different applications in", "12:15", "Thailand it's used almost exclusively", "12:16", "for that sort of purpose in the south", "12:18", "it's a drug that labourers use so they", "12:21", "can you know collect it the latex from", "12:23", "rubber trees and just get their job done", "12:26", "that's what it's about I mean that's", "12:29", "what opioids are about for a lot of the", "12:30", "world both in the United States and in", "12:32", "Africa and in

day he", "13:20", "worked like yeah who's never late", "13:22", "nope just did his work all right Wow", "13:25", "well I didn't think you could do that I", "13:27", "thought you did heroin the next

city hi yeah bye", "76:59", "it'll online yeah because it was never", "77:02", "popular so how do they make it illegal", "77:03", "how do they how do they do that they", "77:06", "don't need any

"79:16", "yeah and and ibogaine is a drug with so", "79:20", "much potential for those people that are", "79:23", "aware of ibogaine it's typically only", "79:24", "discussed as a drug that treats", "79:26", "addiction to opioids which is very very", "79:29", "important especially now but that's the", "79:30", "tip of the iceberg with ibogaine it has", "79:33", "one of the most complex pharmacology of", "79:34", "any drug I've ever studied there's", "79:36", "almost nothing it does not do I mean", "79:39", "it's you know you have the alpha 3 beta", "79:41", "for nicotine ik

is a tragedy it is a tragedy and it's", "80:23", "also so effective I know so many people", "80:26", "that have gone to Mexico and gone to", "80:27", "these clinics and done one ibogaine", "80:31", "session for 24 hours and come out of it", "80:33", "a totally different person come out of", "80:35", "with with a complete new perspective on", "80:38", "even why they were using whatever they", "80:40", "were using in the first place in a way", "80:42", "that they didn't it not only is it", "80:43", "helped eliminate the addictive", "80:45", "properties and the connection that your", "80:47", "body has to those substances but it also", "80:49", "allows you to re-examine why you went", "80:51", "down that road in the first place yeah", "80:53", "oh yeah and there you know there was a", "80:55", "sort of pharmaceutical push to develop", "80:58", "non psychedelic derivatives of ibogaine", "81:00", "that would retain the anti addictive", "81:02", "properties which sounds like a good idea", "81:04", "in theory but so they created this drug", "81:07", "called 18m C and it wasn't psychedelic", "81:10", "but then it also lacked some of these", "81:13", "neurotrophins ive ibogaine but really", "81:17", "the bottom line is that we shouldn't", "81:18", "deny the fact that the psychedelic", "81:22", "activity of these substances is", "81:23", "therapeutic psychotherapeutic in and of", "81:25", "itself you know I had a friend who was", "81:27", "severely severely addicted to heroin and", "81:30", "he traveled to the Netherlands to take", "81:32", "ibogaine and you know took the drug was", "81:35", "going into the experience and started", "81:38", "feeling this intense craving for heroin", "81:40", "and it started looking through his bags", "81:43", "to see if he'd somehow put a little had", "81:45", "forgotten about a little bit of heroin", "81:47", "that could just get him through the day", "81:48", "and then he he goes into his bag and and", "81:51", "then finds a small bag of heroin and", "81:53", "snorts it and then is like I traveled", "81:56", "all the way to the Netherlands to do", "81:58", "this this was I'm a failure I'm", "82:01", "relapsing after all this money all this", "82:03", "work I have no self-control I'm a", "82:04", "terrible terrible person why can't I", "82:07", "just stop and then realize that the", "82:08", "whole thing was a hallucination there", "82:10", "was no heroin he'd hallucinate Adhir own", "82:12", "relapse whoa", "82:18", "Wow", "82:20", "what was your experience with ibogaine", "82:22", "I've never taken high doses the most", "82:24", "I've ever taken is 50 milligrams of", "82:26", "listen effective dose it really depends", "82:29", "there's a sort of move toward micro", "82:32", "dosing ibogaine because it actually does", "82:34", "have a cardiotoxic effect especially at", "82:36", "higher doses so people are looking into", "82:39", "ways of reducing that cardio toxicity by", "82:42", "using it at lower doses for longer", "82:44", "periods of time again this is something", "82:46", "that has to do with prohibition because", "82:48", "in a this prohibition market if you are", "82:52", "addicted to heroin you go to Mexico or", "82:53", "you go to Canada and you go to an", "82:55", "ibogaine clinic you need to get as much", "82:57", "bang for your buck as

do they give you", "83:05", "what is called a flood dose it's a", "83:07", "massive dose often a multi gram dose of", "83:11", "ibogaine because it's just like a", "83:13", "sledgehammer that knocks you down and", "83:15", "allows you to get out of it but is that", "83:17", "the best way that's the fastest way", "83:19", "that's the most appetizing way for", "83:21", "someone that had to travel to do it but", "83:23", "is it the best probably not because we", "83:26", "know that it high doses it has this", "83:29", "potential to induce cardiac arrhythmias", "83:31", "and that can kill and has killed so", "83:34", "people are yet now looking at lower", "83:36", "doses over longer periods of time which", "83:38", "would be ideal if it were legal in the", "83:40", "United States I believe mm-hmm yeah", "83:43", "that's it's a really interesting one to", "83:46", "me it's a it's a really interesting one", "83:48", "because it's got such a long history of", "83:51", "use and so many people have had these", "83:55", "very good experiences with getting off", "83:57", "of addictive drugs from it oh yeah and", "84:00", "it's so relatively unknown as well it's", "84:03", "it's something that you know talk to", "84:05", "someone like you and of course you know", "84:07", "about it but I mean I bet if we walk", "84:08", "down the street and asked a hundred", "84:10", "people I'd be shocked if one of them", "84:12", "knew about it yeah and you know Terence", "84:14", "Mckenna would sometimes talk about", "84:16", "psilocybin as an invention of mushrooms", "84:18", "or as technology or as being synthetic", "84:21", "and I don't really agree with that idea", "84:23", "but an invention of mushrooms or you", "84:25", "would sort of say like this is as", "84:26", "synthetic as a coca-cola bottle this is", "84:28", "like alien", "84:29", "technology that's how you would describe", "84:31", "psilocybin but in my opinion in its you", "84:34", "know it's a pretty simple derivative of", "84:35", "tryptophan you just decarboxylate", "84:38", "methylate the nitrogen twice and then", "84:40", "had this phosphate ester but but", "84:42", "ibogaine that's a crazy molecule that's", "84:46", "like a three-dimensional thing that no", "84:48", "medicinal chemist would have ever", "84:49", "discovered that if there's you know not", "84:52", "to sound mystical but that strikes me as", "84:54", "some sort of plant technology I mean", "84:56", "it's an amazingly complicated structure", "84:58", "it's so complicated that it's almost", "85:00", "impossible to synthesize in fact it", "85:02", "can't be synthesized commercially all", "85:04", "the ibogaine that people use has to be", "85:06", "extracted from plants because that's the", "85:07", "only way to get it Wow I first found out", "85:12", "about it when when Hunter s Thompson", "85:14", "accused Edie muskie of being on it", "85:16", "during the presidential race of was at", "85:20", "1970 or whatever it was that was a", "85:23", "hilarious moment and a lot of people I", "85:26", "think were introduced to what ibogaine", "85:29", "was by that when he said a Brazilian", "85:31", "witch doctor had been flown in it", "85:37", "doesn't even grow in Brazil yeah it", "85:39", "doesn't even make sense well it's also", "85:41", "it was hilarious when he was on the Dick", "85:42", "Cavett show and they asked him about", "85:44", "spreading those rumors and he's like", "85:46", "well there was a rumor that he was doing", "85:49", "this ibogaine and I know because I", "85:53", "started

aware that it's", "103:21", "psychoactive so was there a way or is", "103:25", "there a way for a person living", "103:28", "thousands of years ago to somehow or", "103:29", "another extract DMT from something like", "103:32", "the acacia tree that's a actually spent", "103:37", "some time thinking about that a while", "103:39", "ago it would be", "103:41", "first of all depends on how you define", "103:43", "extraction if it were to in like an", "103:45", "ayahuasca sends like a tea of course yes", "103:48", "but then they would need some sort of", "103:49", "enzyme inhibitor to create the ayahuasca", "103:51", "if it were to create an isolated", "103:54", "smokeable form again you know you could", "103:56", "just do like an aqueous infusion and", "103:58", "then dry that out and

using to extract the", "104:07", "freebase would be like butter or", "104:09", "something and then how would you get rid", "104:10", "of the butter so what is the process", "104:12", "like if you're gonna take a tree that's", "104:14", "rich in DMT and extract DMT from it what", "104:17", "what do you have to use have you ever", "104:20", "done it before no I've never done it oh", "104:22", "okay well it's it's a very generalizable", "104:26", "and simple process that applies to", "104:28", "almost everything in chemistry it's you", "104:30", "know sometimes it's called an acid base", "104:32", "extraction most people that are in the", "104:35", "DMT community go something they call", "104:37", "straight to base and you know the idea", "104:39", "is that the sidechain of the DMT", "104:41", "molecule contains a basic nitrogen that", "104:43", "if it's protonated in an acidic solution", "104:46", "then it's water soluble and if it's", "104:49", "deprotonated then it's only soluble in a", "104:52", "non-polar solvent so what you do is you", "104:54", "just deprotonate the nitrogen with a", "104:56", "base potassium hydroxide or sodium", "104:59", "hydroxide typically and

who I believe is", "105:40", "looking at different alkaloids in", "105:43", "strawberry plants and he was", "105:46", "synthesizing references for these", "105:47", "potential strawberry alkaloids and made", "105:49", "DMT so he didn't know what he had made", "105:50", "other than a potential natural product", "105:52", "found in strong", "105:53", "and and then it wasn't until", "105:56", "saara much later conducted self", "105:59", "experiments with injected DMT that", "106:00", "people became fully aware of its psycho", "106:03", "activity and then people started finding", "106:04", "it in

like somewhere in the", "107:20", "1950s they started extracting DMT the", "107:23", "use of it orally dates back far longer", "107:27", "than that because of use of mao", "107:28", "inhibitors and

well what would be really", "108:08", "interesting is to do an experiment to", "108:11", "see what were the materials that were", "108:13", "available how would this have been done", "108:15", "would you have to use butter as your", "108:17", "nonpolar solvent how well would that", "108:19", "work what would your butter preparation", "108:21", "be done where you put it would you take", "108:22",

"108:29", "from I mean burning right a burning bush", "108:31", "maybe it's just one of those things that", "108:32", "sort of gets conflated right because you", "108:34", "have people today that are very aware", "108:36", "that people smoked DMT and have these", "108:38", "incredibly Tent intense religious", "108:40", "psychedelic experiences and then maybe", "108:42", "they looked at the acacia bush and said", "108:45", "oh the acacia bush is rich in DMT that's", "108:48", "probably where the Moses story came from", "108:51", "right well what's really interesting is", "108:53", "you know DMT has never been found in the", "108:54", "human brain even though Rick Strassman", "108:56", "says that it has been so a lot of people", "109:00", "are constantly assigning altered states", "109:01",

human", "109:29", "body we know that the liver produces it", "109:31", "and we know that the lungs produce it", "109:32", "yeah we're not totally aware of whether", "109:35", "or not there's anecdotal evidence that", "109:37", "points to the pineal gland based on the", "109:40", "rat idea and based on the presence of", "109:42", "certain enzymes that could be", "109:44", "responsible for it but even if it is", "109:46", "even if it is then what there's still a", "109:49", "whole question of how is it released how", "109:52", "is it distributed what receptors does it", "109:54", "activate and is it even necessary as an", "109:57", "explanation for altered states of", "109:58", "consciousness because there", "109:59", "other things in the brain other than DMT", "110:01", "DMT has never even

that is responsible for the", "110:11", "effect of Salvia things like that they", "110:13", "agree are responsible I mean even carbon", "110:15", "dioxide itself can induce a pretty", "110:19",

seen a", "110:45", "mechanistic explanation hmm yeah I think", "110:49", "that was but it would yeah it would make", "110:52", "sense in an early LSD psychotherapy one", "110:54", "of the things that they would do before", "110:55", "giving someone LSD is it give them", "110:57", "something called carbage in' which was a", "110:58", "gas that contained carbon dioxide and", "111:01", "they would
