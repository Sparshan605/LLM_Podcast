and we just know how", "68:24", "to fight one of the first things I", "68:25", "suggest always they spar in advance belt", "68:28", "they spar someone's not going to hurt", "68:30", "them well mark

rather", "69:18", "than spars with someone who teaches you", "69:20", "just to get touched you just get touched", "69:22", "in the face you know you got hit you", "69:24", "know and someone who's fast but has", "69:26", "control and then you learn how to", "69:29", "operate without the the fear and", "69:31", "consequences of like a wild gym brawl", "69:34", "which is like really common a lot of", "69:37", "gyms they have brawls where it should be", "69:40", "just sparring but instead you're really", "69:42", "just fighting all the time", "69:43", "you're fighting constantly those people", "69:45", "always wind up with brain damage like", "69:47", "almost always so a real real issue with", "69:51", "a lot of low level gyms or gyms where", "69:56", "people haven't really considered the",

"70:27", "this is what I've been preaching forever", "70:29", "is that feeling of not knowing how to do", "70:32", "something and trying to figure it out is", "70:34", "crucial as a human being I

growth and", "71:04", "you're a constant self-examination which", "71:08", "a lot of people don't like but I think", "71:10", "is important this is why I think I think", "71:12", "it's important for peace of mind", "71:13", "because I think it may bring rocky", "71:15", "moments where you you don't like what", "71:18", "you find and you just feel like God can", "71:21", "I just just just be cool

darkest kids movie was it", "98:59", "Ted no it was like it was a rabbit maybe", "99:02", "a rabbit movie what was the name of it", "99:05", "look it up Jamie it was like it was", "99:07", "considered one of the I don't know one", "99:10", "of the darkest kids movies it was where", "99:12", "it was all about rabbits and I'm trying", "99:14", "to think de name of it it was I don't", "99:16", "even know what that is", "99:17", "I there was a YouTube video showing", "99:20", "pretty much it was like a highlight reel", "99:23", "of that movie and it was to I think a", "99:26", "Marilyn Manson song

is", "100:14", "remember this but you need to watch this", "100:17", "wow Watership trailer if we play it will", "100:20", "get yanked off of youtube but I'll play", "100:23", "that we can't play any clips dude it's", "100:27", "crazy today with the hold up oh it's not", "100:30", "go ahead take it", "100:31", "take a leak hey Jamie while we're", "100:35", "talking about alligators or crocodiles",

wildlife look", "100:54", "at the mouth and he's he's a hex", "100:57", "advocate but he wasn't a hex advocate", "100:59", "first mm-hmm he was a well let's explain", "101:02", "what hexes explain it the X HECS rather", "101:07", "is uh it's a company that makes these", "101:10", "suits that apparently the the idea is", "101:13", "that they block an electro magnetic", "101:17", "frequency that people admit is that my", "101:20", "same yeah you're good an electromagnetic", "101:23", "current there's something body emits", "101:25", "that they think John Dudley has left the", "101:29", "room he has to be I don't know", "101:33", "this is the most honest way I can say", "101:36", "this John is a big believer in this heck", "101:41", "system and I don't know if it works but", "101:44", "I know a lot of people think it works", "101:46", "and there is a test that they use where", "101:49", "there's a machine see if we can find", "101:52", "they have a video of it explaining how", "101:54", "it works and in the video it says it in", "101:56", "there there's on the website there's a", "101:58", "video link see the video link yeah see", "102:02", "it where says videos third from the yeah", "102:05", "there is there's something with a show", "102:07", "they can swipe their arm over some sort", "102:11", "of a machine that is designed to detect", "102:15", "electrical current that comes from your", "102:17", "body and they do it with just a normal", "102:20", "arm with like a shirt on and then they", "102:22", "deal with this hex suit on and the hex", "102:24", "suit it blocks whatever that frequency", "102:27", "and so the idea is that we're assuming", "102:29", "that somehow or another the animals", "102:32", "might have some sort of method of", "102:36", "detection by way of the actual electoral", "102:38", "energy that's come from a person do I", "102:41", "know if that's correct I do not I do not", "102:43", "know if that's correct it's fascinating", "102:45", "to think of though because I wonder how", "102:48", "many different animals have this", "102:51", "interesting sort of ability to detect", "102:55", "things other than just smelling and", "102:57", "seeing like maybe there's a feel maybe", "103:00", "they have a feel and apparently these", "103:03", "things are particularly effective with", "103:05", "predators which kind of makes sense I", "103:08", "guess that predators would it would feel", "103:11", "the electrical frequency that's coming", "103:14", "from a nervous scared animal or", "103:17", "something's trying to run from it and", "103:19", "these things are really effective", "103:22", "apparently with coyotes and this is this", "103:24", "documentary or this little short film", "103:27", "rather dances Dancing with Dragons", "103:29", "perfect timing I just explained hex to a", "103:32", "tee I'm a wizard without knowing shit", "103:35", "barely got through high school this is", "103:38", "so apparently this signal whatever the", "103:41", "the human signal is I mean that the fact", "103:44", "that they can detect it in this machine", "103:46", "and I've watched that detection it's", "103:48", "real it's legitimate so something's", "103:50", "happening that the Machine detects I", "103:52", "think we would be foolhardy to believe", "103:54", "that animals can't detect that as well", "103:57", "now is that mean that it will work on", "103:59", "everything I believer I'm a believer too", "104:01", "but this is what I think I think it's", "104:02", "there's a whole there's so many factors", "104:04", "when it comes to getting close to an", "104:06", "animal I think they have so many senses", "104:07", "I think they could smell in some insane", "104:10", "way that we can't even imagine", "104:12", "they can hear shit we can never hear", "104:13", "they're just tuned in the idea that that", "104:16", "would be it that they wouldn't have some", "104:18", "other shit that we haven't really", "104:19", "thought of this would be a good guess", "104:21", "for you his name is Forrest Gallente", "104:24", "he's actually he's got some really cool", "104:27", "stuff coming up that I'm not able to", "104:29", "talk about but I I know you and not four", "104:33", "things or yes I know you enough to know", "104:36", "that it's in your wheelhouse but this is", "104:39", "all", "104:40", "hundred percent wild I think I don't", "104:44", "want to say it wrong but I think it's at", "104:45", "a certain place down south of Mexico", "104:49", "this yeah yeah yeah absolutely so this", "104:52", "um he he just had a happy memory that", "104:55", "came out he's in a document he's in a", "104:57", "heck suit that actually has a pattern", "105:00", "that resembles the saltwater crocodiles", "105:03", "whoa did you notice that part I did that", "105:07", "one but I only did once you brought it", "105:08", "up I was making he's mimicking in the", "105:12", "behaviors of a saltwater croc so that he", "105:15", "can literally be within a few inches of", "105:20", "them so did they want they would", "105:23", "probably real dangerous to try that even", "105:25", "the way he did it but did he try it", "105:27", "without the heck suit like they try like", "105:29", "a like a rash guard with the same exact", "105:32", "pattern on it yeah yeah there's there's", "105:35", "there's a lot of really good videos", "105:37", "showing the difference between how much", "105:40", "interaction you can have with certain", "105:42", "animals that especially ones that have", "105:44", "it's scientifically been proven to test", "105:47", "to sense it yeah so you know in the", "105:51", "wildlife community things like sharks", "105:54", "and Shark Week", "105:55", "obviously have a huge amount of funding", "105:57", "behind it", "105:58", "migratory birds same thing so all that", "106:01", "stuff there's been very good", "106:04", "documentation on you know", "106:06", "electromagnetic fields and what animals", "106:09", "can see but when it comes to like the", "106:11", "hunting community obviously there's not", "106:13", "a lot of big funding behind it because", "106:15", "it's a much smaller community but things", "106:19", "like this things that are on Animal", "106:21", "Planet or Discovery Channel I mean these", "106:24", "are things that are at I think a higher", "106:28", "level of you know maybe testing versus", "106:30", "what we have in the hunting side and I", "106:33", "just know that me personally as a hunter", "106:35", "I've experienced more like up close", "106:38", "interaction with it so I just find some", "106:42", "stuff really is it possible that that's", "106:44", "like a placebo effect that you maybe", "106:47", "just we're in a really good spot with", "106:48", "really good wind and you had a few", "106:50", "experiences so you put it together and", "106:51", "you said this is what's happening is it", "106:53", "possible it's", "106:55", "but in the same sense I'll leave that up", "106:58", "to you I think it's possible to but I", "107:00", "just what I brought it up because I", "107:02", "think I think it's possible but I think", "107:03", "people want one or the other right and I", "107:06", "think it's also entirely possible if", "107:08", "there's a machine that can detect your", "107:10", "electrical magnetic frequency or", "107:12", "whatever the fuck that is they when they", "107:13", "do it over that machine there is there", "107:15", "is I've seen it yeah ok so what's", "107:17", "happening there and why are we assuming", "107:18", "animals can't see that well we", "107:20", "definitely see at night they could see", "107:22", "at night yeah right they knew things", "107:24", "that we can't do they smell things we", "107:25", "can't smell they hear things we can't", "107:27", "hear we have intuition why would we", "107:29", "assume that their intuition is not", "107:30", "thousands of times sharper than ours", "107:32", "they're running away from fucking", "107:34", "crocodiles and shit do you know that um", "107:35", "I know when you did the podcast with", "107:38", "James Hetfield you guys talked about", "107:40", "bees a lot do you know that bees when", "107:43", "they go to and from certain flowers", "107:45", "actually they leave an electromagnetic", "107:51", "signal on that part so that actually", "107:55", "other bees can see that and know that", "107:58", "something is another bee had already", "108:00", "been there to pollinate that here yeah", "108:03", "I've got a video I can show you that", "108:05", "actually shows that but did I just ever", "108:08", "tell you about my experience with bees", "108:09", "on fear factor yeah which is super cool", "108:13", "yeah they got together this was a crazy", "108:16", "moment they had trained be easy", "108:18", "communication contest yeah these bees of", "108:21", "this guy had brought in who is a", "108:22", "beekeeper and then while we were doing a", "108:24", "stunt on these people and they put the", "108:26", "bees on these people all of a sudden", "108:27", "this local bee hive emptied out and came", "108:31", "to visit and they all all the bees got", "108:33", "together in the middle of the sky and", "108:34", "talked and we had to sit down for like a", "108:36", "half an hour the guy was like you know", "108:38", "we're not gonna do anything when I got", "108:40", "we have to step back and let them work", "108:42", "this out so he just knew he knew how", "108:45", "like these alien beings are gonna", "108:48", "communicate with each other how they", "108:49", "figure their life forms man and we're", "108:52", "just like odds just bees no it's not", "108:53", "it's a little weird life form that can", "108:56", "fly that somehow into the figures out", "108:59", "they exchange information with these", "109:01", "other weird life-forms they realize hey", "109:02", "we don't we didn't ask to be here when I", "109:04", "try to take over your community we just", "109:06", "we showed up because we're doing fear", "109:08", "factor you know the wiggle dance the", "109:11", "little thing that bees do yeah the", "109:12", "wiggle dance what is that they say", "109:14", "that's they assume that's a that's", "109:18", "actually an electromagnetic dance that's", "109:22", "done to where it gives a signal to the", "109:25", "other bees to where they can actually", "109:26", "know what they're communicating so they", "109:28", "can say things yep",

the", "144:09", "talent of me no question I'm not saying", "144:12", "that I have that but what really is", "144:16", "shitty about that situation is when", "144:18", "someone has 10 times or more talent at", "144:20", "me and they do 1/10 as much", "144:23", "to me that's a big problem so you think", "144:27", "there's a lot of people out there that", "144:28", "are not realizing their full

don't know their time", "144:38", "I think I think they're looking at the", "144:41", "problem is because the people do do that", "144:43", "right yeah absolutely you limit yourself", "144:46", "when you are not looking at what you're", "144:51", "doing when you're so occupied on what", "144:53", "someone else is doing you limit what", "144:56", "your true talent is so is that my", "144:58",

I know you said I just feel like", "145:20", "there's a lot of people doing that yeah", "145:23", "there's I think the my actually think", "145:25", "the majority I think the people that are",
