school", "50:13", "for this unless you have somebody who's", "50:14", "done it and they teach you okay this is", "50:17", "what the get-down is and we didn't have", "50:18", "that really it was all hands-on learning", "50:21", "I know for the first few years man I was", "50:24", "trying to do the voice and I'd end up", "50:26", "you know getting over hyped because the", "50:28", "crowd is hype and I'd start yelling the", "50:30", "verses instead of like rapping them like", "50:32", "on the record I'd throw my voice out my", "50:35", "voice would get scratchy I'd be sounding", "50:37", "like Busta Rhymes and shit you know", "50:39", "and it took me five years to actually", "50:42", "harness how to actually do the shows", "50:45", "with this voice and I had to go to this", "50:47", "opera

let me hear", "51:47", "citko we can't play this on youtube and", "51:50", "she was and she was the opera singer at", "51:52", "one time Wow but she went on to teach", "51:54", "people the technique no kidding man that", "51:58", "is why see because if you try to keep", "52:02", "your breath and sustain a long note like", "52:05", "that from your chest", "52:07", "you won't sustain that note long enough", "52:10", "but if you tighten doing it from your", "52:12", "diaphragm yeah if you tighten up it's", "52:15", "almost like you're gonna take a shit", "52:17", "[Music]", "52:22", "Oh instead
