personality it's", "02:55", "undeniable but also his style in a lot", "02:58", "of ways he kind of does a lot of like", "03:01", "what Wonder Boy does but with less kicks", "03:04", "like he throws kicks to the body he'll", "03:06", "throw like some front kicks I mean you", "03:08", "know like maybe 70% as many kicks wonder", "03:10", "boys a little more kick heavy but it's", "03:13", "that sideways style and he's but he I", "03:16", "think he does it better like there's", "03:18", "maybe something about the focus of the", "03:21", "shots that he's landing the precision of", "03:23",

"03:31", "Boy is better at surprising guys with", "03:33", "his kicks and his angles but Connor sets", "03:36", "it up nice landing combos yeah that are", "03:38", "also precise in this power like he's", "03:41", "touching dudes and you can see it on", "03:42", "their face yeah touched Eddie that he's", "03:45", "like what though well not only that he's", "03:47", "like he's hitting him in a surprised way", "03:49", "and I'm telegraphing it at all like his", "03:51", "ability to like go from bouncing around", "03:55", "to launching that shot is so quick it's", "03:59", "so it's so precise and it's so focused", "04:02", "and there's no fat in his movements it's", "04:04", "just pop yeah and they said there's", "04:06", "gonna be a big announcement afterwards", "04:08", "and I'll say his

you're", "05:01", "batshit crazy that's not happening for a", "05:03", "very long time maybe maybe they work it", "05:05", "out I don't think so I think the next", "05:07", "fight again I don't know this just me", "05:09", "going off whatever the hell I think Joe", "05:10", "but I think his next fight would be Nate", "05:13", "for the belt at 55 because if you think", "05:15", "if you late could be even Tony they're", "05:16", "both deserving and we're MMA Pierce", "05:18", "we're balls deep in MMA we love it and", "05:20", "one of those guys deserves it as far as", "05:23", "numbers in a big
