"152:26", "vocal cords and their ability to project", "152:28", "while they're growing right I wonder if", "152:30", "it's the same thing it's raining it yeah", "152:32", "yeah the same thing it's like there's", "152:35", "certain physical skills like martial", "152:37", "arts in particular where they think that", "152:40", "the very very elite cream of the crop", "152:43", "they start really young really and yeah", "152:45", "guys like Floyd Mayweather started", "152:47", "boxing really really young and he's", "152:49", "pretty much regarded the best boxer ever", "152:51", "and yes as he grew up he grew up like", "152:55", "his body was developing while he was", "152:58", "boxing right you know so it becomes", "153:00", "almost like a part of who you are and", "153:01", "your body and your skills become one of", "153:03", "the thing yeah and they think that when", "153:07", "you're learning and you're like in your", "153:09", "30s like say if you are like a pretty", "153:12", "athletic person you're learning in your", "153:13", "30s you were always going to have like a", "153:15", "giant", "153:16", "deficit right when you're dealing with a", "153:18", "guy like Floyd Mayweather yeah because", "153:20", "it's just so second thing in his bones", "153:22", "it's in his DNA it's clean and honed so", "153:26", "the pathways are so polished and he has", "153:28", "so much understanding cuz he's been", "153:30", "doing his whole life yeah it's it's like", "153:32", "there's certain things you see almost", "153:33", "like you can't catch up can't catch up", "153:36", "to certain that you have to if you want", "153:37", "to if you want to develop those skills", "153:39", "to like the the ultimate peak for some", "153:43", "people it has to be done while they're", "153:45", "growing and evolving it seems seems as", "153:48", "and I was wondering if that was the case", "153:49", "with voices too if we little kids are", "153:52", "singing we're really I'm one of those", "153:54", "little kids develop amazing voices", "153:56", "create like strengthening it as you", "154:00", "think so right like swimmers they start", "154:03", "gymnast yeah yeah everybody starts young", "154:07", "yeah it would make sense that you know I", "154:09", "feel like there's a lot of energy", "154:10", "involved in singing I can't sing but I", "154:12", "feel like

"developing it'll I would think so I", "154:23", "would think so yeah you know people get", "154:26", "classically trained they get all these", "154:28", "different trainings yeah but if you", "154:30", "started younger it does seem like you", "154:32", "would be at such an advantage I wonder", "154:34", "if that's the case with talking shit to", "154:40", "talk shit when you're really
