we talked", "03:19", "about on the last podcast it's just it's", "03:21", "crazy way for a kid to learn hard work", "03:23", "and to learn real competition and thus", "03:25", "the the actual physical

really work", "03:34", "that hard in any other sport I mean it's", "03:36", "it's a crazy sport I remembered in high", "03:38", "school like walking into the wrestling", "03:40", "room and it's a bunch of gross dudes", "03:42", "like in a sweaty hot room and then it", "03:44", "was like basketball is right next to it", "03:46", "I walk because the basketball there's", "03:47", "like news in ten tops and some like", "03:49", "cheerleaders I'm like I know what I'm", "03:51", "doing no I mean it's my opinion still I", "03:58", "think it's the most important skill", "04:00", "because you get to dictate where the", "04:02", "fight takes place I mean there's no one", "04:03", "skill that really overpowers all except", "04:05", "for the ability to hold the guy down", "04:07", "like the ability to hold someone down", "04:09", "and control them on the ground it's so", "04:11", "critical and everything else you can", "04:12", "learn from that submissions", "04:13", "ground-and-pound but the difference in", "04:17", "like an elite wrestler like yourself and", "04:19", "a person who doesn't have that skill", "04:20", "it's it's so hard to bridge that gap", "04:22", "it's hard to learn later in life yeah", "04:25", "he's one of the few people it's just", "04:26", "like I'll just take this up and be", "04:28", "amazing because I'm GSP and then I'll", "04:30", "become a gymnast who knows I think", "04:32", "that's a thing with him though he had", "04:33", "such physical abilities we were talking", "04:35", "about this almost on the last podcast as", "04:36", "well that he used to do that karate", "04:38", "blitz you know so he was he was so used", "04:40", "to that lunging in stuff that he sort of", "04:42", "incorporated that with a blast double", "04:44", "and he's so physically strong and such a", "04:46", "smart dude and so so good at learning", "04:48", "things they just figured out the tech", "04:50", "the the essential techniques and he", "04:52", "needed a master and just got better and", "04:54", "better at him way back in the day", "04:56", "obviously UFC one was kind of discipline", "04:59", "versus discipline kind of grudge match", "05:02", "and having been a lifelong wrestler", "05:04", "that's when I started tune in actually", "05:05", "and taking pride and all the wrestlers", "05:07", "taking names and and grown within the", "05:10", "sport and obviously with the evolution", "05:12", "of the sport it's it's a different", "05:14", "dynamic and obviously each athlete", "05:17", "coming from their own discipline is", "05:18", "really fun for us to work with as", "05:20", "practitioners having their own kind of", "05:21", "sport culture but wrestling is a", "05:23", "obviously a core component to what each", "05:25", "athlete is doing and when I'm working", "05:26", "with athletes and talking through their", "05:29", "weekly training plan and you know how to", "05:31", "feed and fuel for each of these types of", "05:33", "training sessions and hearing them bitch", "05:35", "about how hard those wrestling practices", "05:36", "are I always get a little bit a little", "05:38", "bit of pride they're like yes it is hard", "05:40", "and imagine doing it for eight months", "05:42", "straight for a college wrestling season", "05:43", "and grind that out but it's it's", "05:45", "definitely been fun for me to watch", "05:47", "wrestling as a component of MMA grow and", "05:50", "and be able to contribute to to the", "05:53", "sport on it on a few different yeah I", "05:55", "mean I think the way I've always looked", "05:57", "at it as pressure makes diamonds you", "05:59", "know this is no other way those those", "06:02", "those hard-nosed dudes they come out of", "06:04", "those environments they like if you", "06:06", "think about guys with crazy", "06:08", "determination and mental fortitude", "06:11", "there's a giant chunk of those you could", "06:13", "attribute to wrestlers there's a lot of", "06:14", "them in kickboxing and everything else", "06:15", "as well but there's just seems to be", "06:17", "it's such a unique sport in terms of", "06:20", "hardening like your mental toughness", "06:22", "fishel I mean I mean we at the", "06:29", "performance Institute we always talk", "06:31", "about martial mixed martial arts MMA", "06:33", "this is the decathlon of combat sports", "06:35", "yeah and I think you know our philosophy", "06:37", "is to try", "06:38", "understand all the respective components", "06:40", "that makes a world-class MMA fighter and", "06:42", "I think you know if you're in the UFC", "06:44", "you've got some certain X factors and", "06:46", "that allow you to be world-class and you", "06:49", "know wrestling is a huge component of", "06:51", "that but what we try to do is understand", "06:53", "the limitations as well because in the", "06:56", "decathlon you're only ever as good as", "06:57", "your weakest event right right so if", "06:59", "you're a striker if you're grappler or", "07:00", "if you're a wrestler and you know we're", "07:02", "trying to support each of those to", "07:04", "understand how we can elevate the whole", "07:05", "thing now how much input do you put into", "07:08", "fighters if any into how they", "07:10", "incorporate their skills and like how", "07:12", "they combine their skills together that", "07:14", "you guys offer like coaching on", "07:16", "technique I mean yeah so break down the", "07:19", "philosophy we don't do sports specific", "07:22", "coaching so physical therapy sports and", "07:25", "nutrition strength and conditioning", "07:27", "sports science and then Duncan oversees", "07:29", "all those to make sure that they work", "07:31", "all right so our philosophy anything", "07:33", "that doesn't make you in the better in", "07:35", "the Octagon is pretty pointless so what", "07:38", "what I do is I'll just go over what your", "07:40", "training schedule looks like with you", "07:41", "and then you know where do we feed", "07:44", "accordingly for this practice you know", "07:46", "what and then Grohmann our sports", "07:48", "scientists Wendy can you be recovered", "07:50", "enough for this practice and that's you", "07:52", "know that's the philosophy so it's not", "07:53", "specific if you think about it if you", "07:55", "guys are fighting and the performance", "07:58", "Institute's working with both you we'd", "07:59", "make you as big strong healthy have the", "08:03", "easiest time making weight go into your", "08:05", "fight as fueled as you can but if I", "08:07", "start saying hey you know what yeah he's", "08:10", "pretty susceptible to light kicks then", "08:12", "it becomes you know now we can't support", "08:14", "every athlete so when you talk to people", "08:16", "it's just like here's how to get the", "08:17", "most out of your practices right here's", "08:19", "the way to lay this out to just your", "08:22", "training blocks I don't think a lot of", "08:23", "people understand like basic training", "08:25", "periodization leading up to a fight and", "08:28", "then that's the other problem with the", "08:30", "EOC you don't always have eight weeks 10", "08:32", "weeks 12 weeks sometimes you got four", "08:33", "weeks and it's like alright well where's", "08:35", "your where's your weight where you at", "08:37", "where's your skill where's your", "08:38", "conditioning how can we put those things", "08:39", "together in time to get you ready on you", "08:42", "know but never specific like instruction", "08:47", "on how to deal with a certified or not", "08:48", "that's it's almost like", "08:53", "for a young fighter to have the access", "08:56", "first of all just access to the the", "08:58", "physical facility like just all the", "09:00", "different modalities you guys have and", "09:02", "you know the strength and conditioning", "09:03", "stuff and the the fact that you can one", "09:06", "of the most impressive things the press", "09:07", "of things was the camera set up around", "09:09", "the Octagon so that you could film", "09:11", "sparring sequences and technique", "09:13", "sequences and the fighter you can back", "09:14", "them up and rewind them and watch it and", "09:16", "you can Co see how you drop your leg", "09:17", "here see how your you know your your", "09:19", "chin is up in the air and all these", "09:21", "different different little facts are you", "09:23", "think about the philosophy right you", "09:24", "have to get close to game speed once or", "09:26", "twice a week so for 15 25 minutes you're", "09:29", "gonna get you're gonna risk injury", "09:30", "you're gonna take physical damage that", "09:32", "you're not getting paid for make the", "09:33", "most out of it right let me review it", "09:36", "treat it like a fight think about our", "09:37", "athletes they fight two to four times a", "09:39", "year so that's that's a very limited", "09:41", "amount of actual footage they have but", "09:43", "if you start recording your sparring", "09:45", "sessions and treating them like like a", "09:47", "fight like a shot do this wrong I did", "09:49", "that wrong then you're gonna end up with", "09:50", "more like 80 90 which is you know", "09:53", "baseball basketball even football you", "09:54", "got 20-plus games to you know review", "09:57", "yeah and I think it's really important", "09:59", "for young fighters also to see", "10:00", "themselves doing certain techniques like", "10:02", "they might not notice they might think", "10:04", "they look better than they do like it's", "10:05", "good my coach is full of shit man and", "10:07", "then you log film don't lie and you're", "10:09", "like yeah okay I see what I'm doing", "10:11", "wrong it's not hard sometimes to mimic", "10:13", "you know without without actually seeing", "10:14", "yourself now you guys you you've been", "10:17", "Forrest Griffin former UFC world no one", "10:22", "can ever take that from you sir how does", "10:23", "it feel good thing yeah sure yeah and", "10:28", "now I'm I'm VP of athlete development at", "10:30", "the performance instead so it's much", "10:32", "much more important but you still", "10:34", "Forrest Griffin there's a lot of", "10:35", "champions there's only one VP of athlete", "10:37", "development change a daily don't worry", "10:44", "you've been involved from the beginning", "10:46", "of this right yeah yeah so it was going", "10:49", "on about two weeks in I heard this was", "10:51", "happening and I was like oh hey guys I I", "10:54", "work for you I'm doing community", "10:55", "outreach right now but I've been trying", "10:57", "to figure out the best way to train for", "10:59", "mixed martial arts for the last 18 years", "11:01", "I don't know maybe give me a shot at it", "11:05", "yeah now when you would you say that", "11:09", "there you trying to figure out the best", "11:10", "way is there a best way yes for", "11:12", "everybody but everything unfortunately", "11:14", "it's those bullshit answers everybody's", "11:16", "different man everybody's got a", "11:17", "different ability to work you know like", "11:19", "that who's man might have X amount you", "11:22", "know before he physically breaks down", "11:23", "cuz look at him he's a fucking Ferrari", "11:25", "right and he he needs more high-end work", "11:28", "or you know whatever everybody's a", "11:29", "little physically different the key is", "11:32", "to get some subjective feedback to know", "11:35", "hey art I'm in the red I'm good I'm not", "11:37", "you know do you do you guys do it on", "11:40", "heart rate heart rate variability like", "11:42", "when you determine whether or not", "11:44", "someone's recovered tell me away yeah I", "11:47", "mean there's plenty of different ways to", "11:49", "do it and the most the most basic level", "11:51", "it's just speaking to a guy and getting", "11:52", "subjective feedback right how you feelin", "11:54", "is one of the best questions that we can", "11:56", "ask an athlete but Sam yeah I mean we're", "11:59", "blessed and were privileged with pretty", "12:00", "high resource at the UFC Performance", "12:02", "Institute so we have some pretty", "12:03", "involved technologies one of the ones", "12:05", "that we use is a system called a mega", "12:07", "wave and that gives us a real insight", "12:09", "and removes the subjectivity where it", "12:12", "can get objective understanding around", "12:13", "physiology particularly looking at and", "12:15", "the DC potential of the brain so really", "12:18", "yeah that's the DC potential the brain", "12:20", "is an assessment of the autonomic", "12:22", "nervous system yeah so if you look at if", "12:26", "you look at the parasympathetic and", "12:28", "sympathetic balance of your body we're", "12:30", "talking science now I apologize but", "12:32", "ultimately that's one of the things", "12:34", "that's that's really impacted there you", "12:36", "go Jamie pulled something up on the", "12:37", "screen here John Smith see windows of", "12:40", "trainability yeah fascinating yes and", "12:43", "there's Omega wave oh is it something", "12:45", "you wear yes so ultimate Sam it's a", "12:48", "three to five minute assessment you wear", "12:50", "something that resembles a heart rate", "12:52", "strap lying at rest and we also have", "12:54", "electrodes in anja on you on the third", "12:56", "eye of your brain essentially so we're", "12:59", "picking up cardiovascular stress and", "13:01", "we're picking up the autonomic nervous", "13:02", "system and we're looking at things like", "13:03", "heart rate variability which you've", "13:04", "already mentioned but so this isn't for", "13:07", "everybody some people love it and they", "13:09", "say hey man this is you know again these", "13:11", "are just tools right so different tools", "13:13", "for different people right yeah for sure", "13:15", "it's uh it's a first thing in the", "13:17", "morning measurement to two", "13:18", "understand your your recovery your how", "13:20", "well you recovered from the day before", "13:22", "and those windows of trainability for", "13:24", "the next day so I think it all comes", "13:26", "back to what Forrest says ultimately", "13:27", "what we're trying to do is understand", "13:29", "individual responses right at the end of", "13:32", "the day everyone's on a pathway of", "13:34", "performance mastery to be a world", "13:36", "champion and when people respond to the", "13:39", "workloads the intensities the volumes in", "13:41", "very different ways if we take a", "13:42", "basketball team and put them all through", "13:44", "the same workout you've got 15 different", "13:46", "guys that are responding in very", "13:47", "different ways to the same workout hmm", "13:49", "so we're privileged in that we work with", "13:52", "an individual sport and that's how", "13:54", "that's how a mantra is that we're", "13:55", "looking every single athlete is an", "13:57", "individual and we're building our", "13:58", "programs programming strategies in our", "14:00", "information in an individual way so you", "14:04", "guys have been doing this now for how", "14:06", "many years we're coming up on two years", "14:08", "on May 22nd it's our second anniversary", "14:10", "and do you do you have like a log of all", "14:14", "the different cases you've worked with", "14:16", "so you can kind of review like what", "14:17", "methods were more effective than others", "14:19", "and you're constantly trying to improve", "14:20", "this protocol or yes you guys how do you", "14:22", "guys write it all out", "14:23", "I mean we've obviously been involved", "14:24", "with numerous fight camps but we're also", "14:27", "working with fighters a not in camp", "14:29", "and last year we presented this journal", "14:32", "our first journal which is a overview a", "14:34", "cross-section of all the data that we", "14:36", "accrued in our first 12 months and we", "14:38", "continue to aggregate that data now one", "14:41", "of the privileges that we have at the", "14:42", "Institute is we get the opportunity to", "14:44", "work with just under six hundred", "14:46", "fighters on our roster and so we can", "14:48", "create real clear cross sectional", "14:50", "awareness of what different weight", "14:52", "classes look like what the challenges", "14:53", "are to a fighter and then you know the", "14:56", "fighters can compare and contrast", "14:57", "themselves against their immediate peers", "14:59", "in their weight class so that's one of", "15:00", "the most powerful benchmarking tools you", "15:02", "can create this soar mega wave", "15:03", "technology when people buy that oh yeah", "15:06", "it's just a commercial product off the", "15:08", "shelf and it would it looks like it", "15:09", "worked off an app like you put an app on", "15:11", "your yelling yeah yeah doesn't", "15:12", "everything yeah seems like a thank you", "15:15", "but again we use many different types of", "15:17", "technologies you know things like force", "15:19", "plates can can look at neural muscular", "15:21", "responses and some of our nutrition", "15:24", "variables will change across time so", "15:26", "it's not just one tool that is given us", "15:28", "all the answers that the windows of", "15:29", "trainability concept is something that", "15:31", "really helps us", "15:32", "a day-to-day basis to understand can you", "15:34", "go into a strength or power type session", "15:36", "today and really maximize the", "15:38", "opportunity to create that app tations", "15:39", "another day that you're enduring it", "15:41", "might be an endurance emphasis so what", "15:43", "it allows us to do is just give give", "15:44", "kind of kudos and credence to the", "15:46", "athlete to understand where is the best",

and do", "24:29", "like a skills camp or something first we", "24:31", "have the same out you come in three four", "24:34", "days and then go home with like a", "24:36", "program you know a diet right addition", "24:38", "program PT program your training load", "24:41", "goals etc so you'd leave with that right", "24:44", "and then maybe you know you can't you", "24:45", "don't wanna move your life to Vegas you", "24:47", "got family kids back home so you come", "24:49", "out three days every other month and", "24:50", "they can actually monitor and tell you", "24:52", "this is how your trainings going it's", "24:55", "just again just data on whether it it's", "24:58", "working or not working as opposed to my", "25:00", "old boxing coach oh not today kid I", "25:02", "don't but it's good I don't know yeah", "25:12", "the scientific approach of getting those", "25:14", "little extra percentage points of", "25:16", "improvement is really what it's all", "25:18", "about and it could really be the", "25:20", "difference and it's such a crazy sport", "25:21", "because it's so wild and unpredictable", "25:24", "and you mean you could speak to this", "25:26", "better than anybody the results may vary", "25:29", "right it is a wild goddamn sport I had", "25:32", "one of the best camps I ever had was a", "25:34", "Keith Jardine didn't go so well I was", "25:36", "fucking amazing in the gym I was like I", "25:40", "am so good right now I beat everybody up", "25:42", "this is raise it but you know is a", "25:44", "14-week camp", "25:46", "yeah our fallen party there's no other", "25:48", "sport with as many degrees of freedom as", "25:50", "mixed martial arts right our execution", "25:53", "well there's a stylistic background", "25:55", "white classes and you don't even know", "25:57", "when Dana's gonna give you a call to the", "25:59", "next fight let's let's look at Usain", "26:01", "Bolt right you there's a reason why", "26:02", "Usain Bolt is 100 meter champion and", "26:04", "he's not the 60 meter champion all right", "26:06", "our guys if you look at mixed martial", "26:08", "arts that is six to thirty six seconds", "26:11", "of high-intensity work

right so that's", "26:23", "where the fight is won and lost but you", "26:25", "don't know if that six seconds is gonna", "26:27", "be the first six seconds of the fight or", "26:28", "the last six seconds of the fight so", "26:30", "Usain Bolt knows that he's going 100 100", "26:33", "meters all right our guys don't know if", "26:35", "there needs to be the the best", "26:37", "data the best finish yes so you got to", "26:39", "prepare for everything so all these", "26:40", "degrees of freedom these very external", "26:43", "variable things that come in to mix", "26:44", "martial arts", "26:45", "make it the most complex bullet to", "26:47", "figure out and build a structure and a", "26:49", "development pathway again it's so", "26:51", "interesting to that so many different", "26:52", "fighters have a completely different", "26:54", "approach like you've got low volume", "26:56", "high-power approach like maybe your", "26:58", "tyron woodley and then you got a guy", "26:59", "like Nick Diaz who just smothers guys he", "27:02", "just stays on you and keeps punching you", "27:03", "and talking shit to you and he sees you", "27:05", "starting to lose your breath and it", "27:06", "keeps coming after you and he can push a", "27:08", "pace because of his long term", "27:09", "cardiovascular condition right I mean", "27:11", "it's it's and you can't tell him he's", "27:13", "doing it wrong", "27:14", "no not everybody's doing it sometimes", "27:16", "your physiology right it's gonna", "27:18", "determine the way you fight mmm right", "27:20", "like like the arm length of John Jones", "27:22", "and the leg and arm length I can't fight", "27:24", "like that cuz I'm gonna get I'm not", "27:25", "gonna be at the end of everybody's punch", "27:28", "just out of reach I'm gonna be getting", "27:29", "hit by everybody if I start throwing", "27:31", "those tips you know yeah", "27:32", "and also it allows him in training to", "27:35", "like get better like he's always got", "27:37", "this so he's got this advantage he's", "27:39", "like constantly getting better and he's", "27:41", "also the best I've ever seen at", "27:43", "utilizing that reach he's very good at", "27:46", "keeping in his opponent exactly where he", "27:48", "needs him and in in his range and then", "27:51", "when they close up he's very good at", "27:53", "being defensive I mean it's it's mean", "27:55", "that's what the best fighters do right", "27:56", "the fight where they want it to go but", "27:58", "it's just so interesting to see that", "28:00", "everyone does have a different approach", "28:01", "that they make work with their body", "28:04", "structure it's quite unique as we've", "28:05", "looked at a lot of our physiological", "28:07", "assessments and when you take the data", "28:09", "and you compare and contrast for example", "28:11", "people with grappling and wrestling", "28:13", "backgrounds versus striking backgrounds", "28:15", "you you can take something like power", "28:17", "and you can differentiate between those", "28:19", "two so all right I want to get a", "28:20", "competitive advantage as a striker and", "28:23", "might need to improve my strength work", "28:25", "because the wrestlers are already", "28:27", "stronger than me we can look at the", "28:29", "strength characteristics and you know", "28:31", "our data shows that those comes the guys", "28:33", "that come from a wrestling background", "28:34", "are far and above stronger than the", "28:36", "strikers which you would expect right", "28:38", "but if you look at things like can you", "28:40", "differentiate our top 15 in the world", "28:42", "versus the rest of the roster in that", "28:44", "weight class it just it takes away any", "28:46", "comparative any comparison and at the", "28:50", "end of the day all", "28:51", "in a complex chaos based sport skill is", "28:55", "always going to be the best determinant", "28:56", "of performance so we're not saying that", "28:59", "the physiological variables aren't", "29:00", "important to the sport of MMA but it's", "29:02", "really hard to tease out where you need", "29:05", "to push your strategy and where you need", "29:06", "to optimize your training because in a", "29:09", "in a homogeneous population of", "29:11", "world-class fighters it kind of gets up", "29:13", "absorbed and it becomes invisible where", "29:15", "the differences are an important point", "29:17", "we usually are a little more specific", "29:19", "perhaps just told me what not to do what", "29:23", "do though well and that's where the", "29:24", "individualization personalization for", "29:26", "every single athlete comes in we find", "29:28", "their strengths and in some of their", "29:30", "their gaps where it might be the the", "29:33", "lowest point scoring component of their", "29:35", "decathlon of MMA and if it's a", "29:37", "deficiency that maybe hasn't been taken", "29:39", "advantage of yet but we'll that's where", "29:42", "we fill those gaps so that they can", "29:44", "start to fill those holes and become", "29:45", "more complete more comprehensive that", "29:47", "might be strength power it might be", "29:50", "energy system it may be it could be", "29:52", "anything it could be orthopedic I mean", "29:54", "we have where we're trying to assess", "29:56", "every component of

vital that if", "30:09", "somebody's working on their strength and", "30:10", "power they're not feeding their body in", "30:12", "a way that's actually limiting their", "30:15", "ability to perform at a high intensity", "30:17", "training right because then that limits", "30:18", "the the adaptation that we're looking", "30:21", "for as a response to that training and", "30:23", "that's that's a really critical point", "30:24", "where nutrition fills it really is a", "30:27", "foundation that supports the development", "30:30", "of all the other adaptations that are", "30:32", "required to become that complete mixed", "30:35", "martial artist so is the strength and", "30:37", "conditioning plan is being laid out as", "30:39", "the physical therapy plan as the", "30:42", "recovery plan all of those are coming to", "30:44", "fruition the nutrition obviously is", "30:46", "really near and dear to what I'm doing", "30:48", "is really critical at supporting the", "30:50", "adaptation so that we're not pulling the", "30:52", "but you know that the athlete in two", "30:54", "different directions in terms of the", "30:55", "adaptation now in terms of when you take", "31:00", "fighters and athletes into your", "31:02", "performance Institute have you", "31:04", "guys ever worked with young jr. like", "31:07", "amateur mixed martial artists kids that", "31:09", "are coming up and did you ever do stuff", "31:11", "like that", "31:12", "to show them like give them a peek at", "31:14", "what it's like to see like the", "31:16", "world-class fighters well we don't have", "31:18", "the performance Institute in Las Vegas", "31:19", "because we're very much aligned to", "31:21", "supporting our current roster right and", "31:24", "it's a facility and a philosophy that's", "31:26",

expectation of", "35:13", "what a professional athlete should", "35:15", "should really expect browner tiger has", "35:17", "worked out in his garage most of his", "35:18", "crit garage sorry it's a but in terms of", "35:23", "you know what's the expectation that", "35:25", "professional fighters should expect you", "35:27", "know the Performance Institute", "35:28", "demonstrates that you know not everyone", "35:30", "can have access to it obviously but", "35:31", "that's enough", "35:32", "operation and it's it's where people", "35:34", "should understand in the sport of mixed", "35:35", "martial arts the standard as a", "35:36", "professional fighter you can expect and", "35:38", "it's it's so important I think that you", "35:41", "put all these things under one roof like", "35:43", "that and create this environment because", "35:45", "it seems to be trickling off into other", "35:47", "places like the the the level of", "35:49", "training and recovery and everything is", "35:51", "so intense and so severe that people are", "35:53", "starting to try to mimic certain aspects", "35:55", "of that and there are their own gyms and", "35:57", "their own different place the problem is", "35:59", "you can't do things in isolation all", "36:01", "right if you just say where I'm gonna", "36:03", "really hammer the recovery piece and", "36:04", "forget about the nutrition piece mmm", "36:06", "it's it's a large machine right there's", "36:08", "cogs and all the cogs need to work", "36:10", "together and that's what we truly feel", "36:12", "we can offer and we we can deliver is", "36:14", "this integral necessarily a", "36:16", "multidisciplinary service but an entire", "36:18", "mister plenary service where we have", "36:20", "multiple aspects coming together to fill", "36:23", "the whole picture of an athlete's", "36:24", "portfolio of needs and that's what we", "36:26", "can offer through the performances did", "36:28", "you the other thing we want to do is", "36:29", "figure out what the best practices are", "36:31", "and disseminate them like we don't want", "36:33", "to just know a bunch of stuff so we can", "36:34", "keep it remember we want every other gym", "36:37", "like hey here's what we've learned this", "36:39", "is how we do our recovery take a take of", "36:42", "it try it see if your recovery see if", "36:44", "you want a laser bed maybe you do maybe", "36:45", "you don't", "36:46", "this is what we found success in you", "36:48", "know so you wanna you know what's the", "36:50", "point to learn something and then hiding", "36:51", "their way yes sir", "36:53", "and everything's about assessment so", "36:55", "it's not one recovery modalities not one", "36:57", "nutrition modality it's not one strength", "36:59", "thing auditioning its assessing so then", "37:01", "we could build that personalized", "37:02", "approach and so here are the modalities", "37:04", "here's the philosophy that we've", "37:06", "developed to help optimize athlete's", "37:09", "knees around what what what we're", "37:12", "measuring and we're not winning fights", "37:14", "that's that's obvious that comes with", "37:17", "the X factors that comes from the", "37:18", "fighters they're their passion and their", "37:20", "commitment to their sport but what we're", "37:22", "trying to do back back to your original", "37:23", "question I think around this 1% is so", "37:26", "hard to measure but what we're able to", "37:28", "do is to help them to do it more", "37:29", "consistently and to do it longer into", "37:32", "their career so that they can they can", "37:34", "optimize they can maximize their ability", "37:36", "to train to adapt to perform and give", "37:40", "themselves the best chance to be", "37:41", "successful on fight night yeah there", "37:43", "must be so many fighters that come from", "37:45", "discipline whether it's judo or", "37:47", "something on those lines and then they", "37:48", "start fighting in MMA so they get a", "37:49", "boxing coach and they have a few guys", "37:51", "working with them on leg kicks but they", "37:53", "don't have a nutrition guy and they", "37:54", "don't have a recovery guy I don't know", "37:56", "if someone understands like deep tissue", "37:57", "massage they had to find that guy they", "37:59", "got to find someone to organize a diet", "38:01", "for them they got to figure out how to", "38:02", "cut weight healthy proper and there's", "38:05", "these things are so difficult for", "38:06", "fighters to put especially you don't", "38:08", "live in a place that has something like", "38:10", "an American Top Team or some gigantic", "38:12", "institution yeah I mean this fights is", "38:16", "even top fighters on our roster might", "38:18", "potentially hire a nutritionist for a", "38:20", "short period of time and if I come you", "38:21", "know for an eight-week period mm-hmm", "38:23", "this this should be a 52-week fight we", "38:26", "should be considering our development as", "38:28", "fighters and as athletes professional", "38:29", "athletes 52 months 52 weeks of the year", "38:32", "you know I think that's right", "38:35", "that's what our philosophy is as Clint", "38:38", "has already talked about in terms of", "38:40", "plug in the holes and being able to", "38:42", "offer the services that you need as a", "38:44", "particular athlete so there's large gyms", "38:46", "out there American Top Team aka they've", "38:48", "got their own guys that's that's great", "38:50", "Jackson they've got their own people and", "38:51", "but you know there's plenty of people on", "38:54", "the roster that have an MMA coach and a", "38:56", "grappling coach and that's it so the", "38:59", "performances that you we feel we can", "39:01", "help and support those guys do you", "39:02", "bridge the gaps right and we're not", "39:03", "trying to displace the the programs", "39:05", "where athletes already have resources", "39:07", "but I don't know of another MMA gym", "39:11", "globally that has the capacity around", "39:13", "assessment that we do so yeah we have we", "39:15", "have some really great practitioners but", "39:17", "bose and of our strength coach and his", "39:19", "team cannot write programs for 570", "39:22", "athletes it's not possible but what we", "39:24", "can do is assess those athletes provide", "39:27", "that feedback back to their strength", "39:28", "coaches and have conversations about how", "39:30", "those coaches can use that data to", "39:33", "support the development of that athlete", "39:34", "and that that goes across the board for", "39:36", "all of our performance services well", "39:37", "it's a pretty amazing resource because", "39:39", "if you're a young fighter and all you", "39:41", "have is access to the people around you", "39:44", "you if you're fighting the UFC you get", "39:46", "to have access like instantaneously to", "39:48", "this gigantic group of people where it's", "39:50", "like it went for us when you were coming", "39:51", "up you mean you were real pioneer I mean", "39:53", "that was that was not available to a guy", "39:56", "like you know I mean I", "39:58", "the story all the time but so I was", "39:59", "actually a little bit ahead of my time I", "40:01", "had you know I had an actual strength", "40:03", "coach that had letters behind his name I", "40:05", "went to college to be a strength coach", "40:07", "not there was like an ex bodybuilder I", "40:09", "had you know a relatively good nutrition", "40:12", "as to at least had a degree in chemical", "40:14", "biology I had a good physical therapist", "40:17", "but I didn't really have like I was my", "40:20", "coach you know at the end of the day I", "40:22", "was the head of performance so I'd go", "40:23", "did you Jitsu and you know jiu-jitsu", "40:26", "coach one should go hard and then you go", "40:27", "kickbox but you're gonna go light but", "40:29", "it's kick butt so you don't and then you", "40:30", "know and now you know nobody's - the", "40:33", "strength coach and nutritionist on", "40:35", "different pages so I think just", "40:37", "understanding that everything has to", "40:39", "work together which I didn't really", "40:41", "understand well what I'm saying is that", "40:43", "you kind of had to pave a path because", "40:47", "when a guy like you was doing all that", "40:49", "stuff with a real legitimate strengthen", "40:50", "condition coach real legitimate", "40:51", "nutritionist how many other people were", "40:53", "doing that at your time not that many", "40:56", "but I got to be around good people like", "40:58", "Randy Couture Chuck Liddell those were", "41:00", "kind of guys I got to hang out and say", "41:01", "well he does this he does that Chuck", "41:03", "actually what him did how much of this", "41:04", "stuff but rain I know what I'm doing kid", "41:08", "all right yes sir yeah he just existed", "41:11", "on pure savagery when you step back and", "41:14", "look at your career like how amazing is", "41:18", "it to be able to step off from there and", "41:20", "do something like you're doing now for", "41:22", "the UFC Performance Institute it was", "41:24", "just very meaningful for young fighters", "41:26", "when you really do get a chance to give", "41:28", "back with your experience and your", "41:30", "understanding of the right way in the", "41:31", "wrong way the mistakes that you've made", "41:33", "it's huge", "41:34", "I mean that's the whole that I mean", "41:36", "that's the whole genesis kind of from", "41:38", "from my involvement in the PI like look", "41:40", "here's the ten thousand mistakes I made", "41:42", "yeah you're gonna make mistakes too but", "41:44", "these are the ones you don't need to", "41:46", "make you know again the sports changed", "41:48", "man it's 25 years old every other sports", "41:51", "so evolved bends around so long our", "41:53", "sport changes all the time I forget who", "41:55", "was talking about it but you know even", "41:57", "the guys fighting ten years ago probably", "41:59", "couldn't compete with gas fighting today", "42:01", "you know but I mean what I would say is", "42:03", "well and it's not only for the fighters", "42:05", "Forrest is a huge resource for us the", "42:07", "bet the best piece of technology we have", "42:09", "is the door handle that leads from my", "42:10", "office to", "42:11", "to forest office right because", "42:12", "ultimately he's a massive resource for", "42:15", "us that are not necessarily coming from", "42:16", "an MMA background and are trying to", "42:19", "support the MMA community to bounce", "42:22", "ideas off to essentially beta test", "42:24", "things from a thought process", "42:25", "perspective and he's a huge part of the", "42:27", "performance institute philosophy because", "42:29", "we can use and call upon his expertise", "42:31", "so here's another funny thing when we", "42:33", "were putting together the the the team", "42:35", "for the PI I kind of shied away from", "42:38", "people already doing MMA I wanted combat", "42:41", "sports everybody that's done it has done", "42:43", "judo boxing on an Olympic level they've", "42:46", "done combat sports but I wanted like a", "42:48", "fresh set of eyes coming from a", "42:50", "different you know than just you know", "42:52", "because I know really good anime", "42:54", "strength coaches I know pretty good MMA", "42:57", "you know you you you know good and but", "43:00", "get get that fresh set of eyes you know", "43:02", "nutrition actually was a little", "43:03", "different because the rest of the world", "43:05", "does not understand a way cut for an MMA", "43:08", "fight it's not like it you know we go to", "43:10", "EXO should go to any high level facility", "43:12", "and they you say I'm gonna lose a", "43:13", "percent of my body weight and then", "43:15", "compete on Saturday they're like no", "43:16", "don't just fight in the high weight", "43:17", "class I'm like yeah that actually isn't", "43:20", "gonna work out for me", "43:21", "they they just won't comprehend it", "43:23", "though I know you perform better like", "43:25", "none so it's that's another thing about", "43:29", "having a limited amount of weight", "43:31", "classes when you jump up Chan is crazy", "43:33", "man yeah he's like 174 175 on fight day", "43:37", "yeah", "43:37", "fighting guys 190 yeah but with a lot of", "43:40", "energy Z yeah that's interesting is that", "43:41", "his age O'Neil's yeah I think it's", "43:45", "probably a good move though at his age", "43:46", "you know I think he's back from UFC", "43:49", "Ultimate Fighter wanted inside we knew", "43:52", "though like on the show that he was the", "43:54", "one that would go forever just crazy", "43:58", "awesome is that gonna stop I mean when", "44:01", "when he beat mickey gall that way I was", "44:03", "I was incredibly impressed you know like", "44:06", "this kid might test him he didn't test", "44:07", "him at all I mean he was amazing", "44:08", "so prime Diego Sanchez performance 15", "44:11", "years into the game I mean it doesn't", "44:13", "even not even just into that's just in", "44:16", "to the UFC yeah he had amateur fights", "44:18", "and our professional fights rather", "44:19", "before the UFC he's been in the UFC for", "44:23", "50", "44:23", "Chris Brown or at least 14 right", "44:27", "2004-2005 was yeah we shot at 2004-2005", "44:31", "so yeah what's that", "44:32", "yes I'm we're somewhere in the", "44:34", "neighborhood of 15 years just amazing", "44:36", "that he's so enthusiastic about it still", "44:38", "yeah they'll give him a vase for his top", "44:40", "of his mantelpiece on his fire or", "44:41", "something carriage clock or something", "44:43", "just to recognize it 15 years yeah yeah", "44:46", "that's uh that's a long time in a combat", "44:49", "sport a long time so that's the other", "44:52", "thing man", "44:53", "that is not the norm that's the", "44:55", "deviation right don't leave you got it", "44:57", "for I made it nine years in the UFC", "44:59", "eight years actually and you know I", "45:01", "didn't have that many fights I broke", "45:03", "down I fell apart", "45:04", "yeah that's pretty average you know I", "45:06", "was like woe is me and then when you", "45:07", "look at the data it's like oh no I'm", "45:09", "just average 35 that's that's when you", "45:12", "start fall apart when you look back now", "45:15", "with what you know now and all the", "45:16", "athletes you've worked with at the UFC I", "45:18", "do you think you would have done", "45:19", "anything different eight rounds why", "45:28", "would you spar a rounds there's no a", "45:29", "road fight are you literally just", "45:34", "getting slower Forrest you already slow", "45:36", "I don't know it's again being a pioneer", "45:41", "like you were there wasn't really a", "45:43", "whole lot of guys before you that were", "45:45", "operating I had the other pioneers like", "45:47", "the Randy's and the chums and that's", "45:49", "what they were doing so I better be top", "45:51", "of it or do it they - that's the", "45:53", "craziest thing about shit man is I'm not", "45:55", "gonna question them boxing it already", "45:57", "figured out you shouldn't beat the fuck", "45:58", "out of each other every day they'd", "45:59", "already kind of figured that no and the", "46:01", "other thing they figured out is we would", "46:04", "work with people I would spar with", "46:06", "Wanderlei Chuck Randi in boxing they", "46:09", "don't spar with people they're equals", "46:10", "past a certain point in camp well think", "46:13", "about it you know a lot of it they start", "46:15", "like is Floyd Mayweather sparring with I", "46:18", "don't know really good people his level", "46:20", "no no definitely not", "46:22", "he sees when he blood boxers and he's", "46:24", "tooling them yes yeah have you heard of", "46:28", "them though they're not famous and rich", "46:29", "so they're not they're not elite whereas", "46:32", "do you think about like a gym like our", "46:35", "gym like I'll just use Randy's because", "46:37", "wanna talk bad about anybody you're", "46:38", "fighting other champions every day right", "46:41", "maybe dangerous as fuck yeah maybe", "46:44", "drilled together sure learn from each", "46:45", "other roll wrestle like control your", "46:48", "training especially guys that are in the", "46:50", "same weight class as you that may", "46:52", "someday fight you that's awkward yeah", "46:54", "yeah and there was no guidebook yeah you", "46:58", "know you know guys like Keith Jardine", "47:00", "and I shot Evans figured out they're", "47:01", "like I we already had to fight each", "47:03", "other we'll train together now so we", "47:05", "won't have to do it again right it's", "47:07", "good move if it works out the the level", "47:11", "of guys now is it's so extraordinary to", "47:14", "see like when you see the elite", "47:15", "champions of today you you just have", "47:18", "this insane level of a fighter it's it's", "47:21", "really as a person who's been involved", "47:22", "in the sport as long as I have I still", "47:25", "never cease to be

after watching that yeah", "48:37", "like that's funny mention that I just", "48:39", "think about Holly Holm like what she", "48:40", "made out of she's had a million fights", "48:43", "like what",

in", "49:20", "my opinion she did the more damage in", "49:22", "that fight and I was I was shocked but", "49:24", "that mean mmm a judge yeah it's never", "49:27", "gonna dad's crazy we cannot help you", "49:29", "with that at the performance Institute", "49:32", "but we got some data when I was getting", "49:33", "that before when you were talking about", "49:35", "little kids when I was I was rather", "49:37", "talking about kids coming up and amateur", "49:39", "fighters they were probably something", "49:42", "that would be really beneficial of", "49:44", "having some sort of a program

that have already", "49:56", "been kind of gone gone over and that's", "49:59", "your background the British Olympics is", "50:04", "that would that be something that the", "50:06", "UFC would ever

"contested two people are coming to this", "50:36", "boat with so many different backgrounds", "50:38", "so are you gonna chop that that X access", "50:41", "route to to the UFC in half or you", "50:44", "actually gonna promote it and find you", "50:46", "know many ways to get into the UFC I", "50:48", "think you know we can look at things", "50:49", "like the Olympic Games that does it emma", "50:52", "may ever ever enter into Olympic Games", "50:54", "and create a pathway who knows and I'm", "50:56", "sure the UFC a you know", "50:57", "looking into that type of thing in the", "50:59", "future and trying to be ambitious but", "51:00", "right now it's hard to define what's", "51:02", "that what's the optimal way and one that", "51:04", "it was the optimal route into the UFC", "51:06", "yeah it is really that's one of the more", "51:10", "interesting things about it like we were", "51:11", "saying before you could really have any", "51:13", "combat sport path boxer

there a lot", "54:22", "of the Brazilian jiu-jitsu players", "54:23", "especially from Brazil have their sport", "54:25", "culture so it's so intriguing being able", "54:27", "to you know nothing we

female", "54:39", "athletes like you alluded to earlier", "54:40", "adds a whole another layer in terms of", "54:42", "the dynamics that were working with in", "54:45", "terms of the physiology with with our", "54:46", "yeah I was just like the female", "54:48", "physiology in the weight cut that's just", "54:50", "a whole like you really need to go to", "54:52", "school for that yeah I would imagine", "54:53", "that's a big difference now you help", "54:55", "them organize their weight cuts I know", "54:57", "you work with tomorrow Guzman for his", "54:59", "cut for his last fight so so with", "55:01", "tomorrow we we absolutely worked with", "55:04", "him all the way through all the way", "55:06", "through the fight did you guys know he", "55:07", "had a broken foot he was limping around", "55:09", "but we you know no we didn't and if we", "55:12", "did we were to mentioned it but no I had", "55:13", "no idea and you know crazy is that guy", "55:16", "hey he I did not he you know that's good", "55:18", "that's awesome night I was actually", "55:20", "happy he's in the building", "55:22", "for the whole time and I", "55:23", "know that I was happy as a yes good what", "55:27", "happens in the walls stays in these", "55:29", "walls cuz if there's this place like the", "55:31", "Performance Institute and it's run by", "55:32", "the UFC oh the the UFC that pays me to", "55:35", "fight people I'm worried that that's", "55:37", "gonna get to that right oh of course we", "55:41", "started this like I don't want to know", "55:43", "like I'm the liaison from them to the", "55:46", "other side of the half I don't want to", "55:47", "know whose weight is what I don't want", "55:50", "to know who's got a nagging injury", "55:51", "that's your you know some of that is", "55:53", "actually HIPAA you know information", "55:55", "that's your private stuff though even if", "55:57", "it's just how strong or weak you are if", "55:59", "you're having a bad day I don't I don't", "56:01", "want that to ever get out of our walls", "56:03", "right so that's obviously yeah yeah", "56:06", "you're a conspiracy guy it's you know", "56:08", "what does have to do with yeah guys", "56:11", "always think the UFC's out to get him oh", "56:13", "me too I always thought like ah they're", "56:16", "gonna find out that I got this or that", "56:17", "and you know well you know it all dries", "56:20", "out for me the stress of preparation for", "56:23", "a fight I mean people are always worried", "56:24", "especially if there's a little tweak", "56:25", "something going on something with the", "56:27", "hand something with a leg some with the", "56:29", "knee it gets out people find out about", "56:31", "hear about it yeah yeah that's the thing", "56:33", "it's the thing tomorrow in you know", "56:36", "every other athlete we work with comes", "56:37", "in with sensitive injuries and we have a", "56:39", "private treatment suite within the", "56:41", "performance Institute the the PT area so", "56:44", "they can come get private treatment and", "56:46", "then in terms of you know supporting him", "56:48", "for his weight cut that that starts 10", "56:51", "weeks 12 weeks for tomorrow you know", "56:53", "three four months in advance you trying", "56:55", "to get him down to before the day of the", "56:57", "cut so every athlete is going to be a", "56:59", "little bit different based on what what", "57:01", "their background is what is comfortable", "57:04", "cutting from yeah what Ryan what their", "57:06", "historical weight cutting practices have", "57:09", "been how hard they've been on the body", "57:11", "so we're assessing somebody like", "57:13", "tomorrow for their metabolic rate where", "57:16", "they fit in terms of their body", "57:17", "composition into that weight division", "57:19", "their word lean tissue versus their", "57:20", "their fat tissue those that have a", "57:22", "higher degree of lean tissue are going", "57:24", "to have a muscle has more water than", "57:26", "than just fat and bone so you can push", "57:28", "the body a little bit further for those", "57:30", "that have a higher lean tissue and so", "57:33", "all of that planning and preparation", "57:34", "starts many many weeks in advance", "57:37", "and and having heard tomorrow on your", "57:39", "show a couple weeks ago a lot of a lot", "57:42", "of what we do with an athlete that", "57:44", "doesn't have a history of missing weight", "57:46", "may have a hard time making weight but", "57:48", "oftentimes they're making it harder on", "57:50", "themselves because they're pulling the", "57:52", "body in two different directions like we", "57:53", "talked about if they're training in one", "57:55", "way and feeding in a different way what", "57:57", "they're doing is they're just", "57:57", "undermining and kind of digging a dig in", "57:59", "a hole that they can't get out of by the", "58:01", "end of fight camp and that fight camp", "58:02", "gets really long like force talked about", "58:04", "what do you see in terms of the way they", "58:06", "fuel themselves it's like the biggest", "58:07", "error sticking to one one style of", "58:11", "feeding regardless of the training style", "58:13", "that they're engaging in so MMA athletes", "58:15", "they have to do high-intensity training", "58:17", "sessions strength and conditioning they", "58:19", "have to be doing sparring they have to", "58:20", "be doing pads rounds that are crazy hard", "58:23", "in every athlete each one is going to", "58:26", "have a different intensity relative to", "58:28", "their body type and so if somebody's", "58:30", "doing pads it's a nine or a ten out of", "58:32", "ten in terms of intensity and they're", "58:34", "doing that fasted or they're doing that", "58:36", "without carbohydrates available to do", "58:38", "that work they can't they can't a hit", "58:41", "those training intensities repeatedly", "58:42", "and then they can't adapt as a response", "58:45", "to that training so they end up just", "58:47", "getting slower and more beat up instead", "58:49", "of faster and more powerful so if", "58:51", "they're doing high-intensity we need to", "58:52", "fuel the body in the specific way that", "58:54", "supports that training effort and then", "58:56", "the longer turn adaptation to that bout", "58:59", "additionally if they're doing low", "59:01", "intensity we can adjust our fueling", "59:03", "strategies based on what that dictates", "59:05", "you know if it's if it's a kind of a", "59:08", "base aerobic training session or if", "59:10", "they're doing skills and drills we want", "59:12", "to be feeding the body to adapt", "59:14", "differently than if they're doing the", "59:15", "high intensity sparring strengthening", "59:17", "conditioning or pads or whatever that", "59:19", "might be so for every athlete we're", "59:21", "looking at how their body uses substrate", "59:23", "energy the energy that they're using the", "59:25", "substrate between carbs and fat at each", "59:27", "of these intensities and then we also", "59:29", "need a base at base we need to base our", "59:32", "recommendations on where their body fits", "59:34", "into the division if they're if they're", "59:36", "20% out from their weight division four", "59:39", "weeks out then we're gonna have a little", "59:41", "bit of a more aggressive strategy", "59:42", "nutritionally because if weight becomes", "59:45", "a primary factor if they're 10 percent", "59:48", "out 4 weeks out then we're going to have", "59:50", "a little bit of a", "59:50", "different conversation and", "59:51", "prioritization around the fueling", "59:53", "strategies and all of these", "59:55", "conversations integrate within our", "59:57", "strength and conditioning program so", "59:58", "that we're working in concert and tying", "60:00", "in the workload in into our own system", "60:04", "as well as the the training load that", "60:05", "they're engaging with with their skill", "60:07", "specific training now when you vary the", "60:09", "diet that you give them independent", "60:11", "dependent of the workout what is what is", "60:12", "that based on is that based on a hard", "60:15", "accepted science of carbohydrate versus", "60:18", "protein versus eventual fat essential", "60:19", "fatty acids like how do you determine", "60:21", "that so we we use a philosophy a system", "60:25", "called metabolic efficiency you could", "60:26", "call metabolic flexibility I've heard it", "60:28", "called as well", "60:28", "and essentially the body will use", "60:31", "different substrate at different", "60:32", "intensities and at low intensities and", "60:35", "at rest the body can and likely should", "60:38", "be adapted for our for our sports", "60:41", "athletes to to fat at rest now it", "60:44", "depends on the sport type again if we're", "60:46", "a shot putter or if we're a hundred", "60:48", "meter printer then we're going to be", "60:50", "much more dependent on carbohydrates and", "60:52", "really the creatine phosphate system", "60:54", "we're not even getting into the glycolic", "60:56", "system and Duncan could talk a lot more", "60:57", "about the energy systems but essentially", "60:59", "we're reliant upon glucose and ATP for", "61:03", "energy at the lower intensity bursts", "61:05", "right so to hit repeated max or sub max", "61:08", "efforts we require blood sugar and", "61:10", "without it we will deplete our initial", "61:14", "stores and then we can't we can't we can", "61:17", "no longer hit 90 or 95% of our max we", "61:19", "start hitting 80 and 70 and 60 and in", "61:22", "diminishing our ability to do these", "61:24", "high-intensity efforts now do you guys", "61:25", "see anybody come in and try to fight on", "61:27", "a ketogenic diet cuz I know quite a few", "61:29", "guys we're doing that for a while I know", "61:31", "Bryan caraway did it Matt Brown yeah", "61:34", "that's right he has fought but he varies", "61:36", "and I think he yeah well I talked to him", "61:38", "I think he did one pretty pure and then", "61:40", "he did you know he did the one where you", "61:42", "you know you might take in sixty or", "61:44", "eighty carbs but then you were come off", "61:46", "from the state Kittichai I don't mhm", "61:48", "some of those guys like Zack bitter he's", "61:50", "a altra marathon runner he he there he", "61:53", "does eat ketogenic most of time but then", "61:56", "on days of big races he'll consume a lot", "61:59", "of sugars yeah and yeah and again on", "62:01", "insulin sensitivity too", "62:03", "yeah so essentially the more we could", "62:05", "regulate blood sugar at rest and low", "62:07", "intensities then we can expand and to", "62:10", "support the development of that kind of", "62:12", "aerobic oxidative system and by adapting", "62:16", "to use fat as a primary substrate we're", "62:18", "doing a number of things one we're", "62:19", "balancing blood sugar at rest so that we", "62:21", "can really limit the insulin spikes and", "62:24", "and essentially adipose development in", "62:27", "addition to really driving the body", "62:31", "towards the oxidative and/or the", "62:33", "oxidative aerobic system and then as we", "62:36", "increase in what we do is we assess how", "62:38", "the body adapts out through the training", "62:41", "intensities and we'll repeat that kind", "62:42", "of on a monthly basis to see how the", "62:44", "athlete changes and then as they", "62:46", "increase in the intensity of a training", "62:48", "effort then we will adjust the ratio of", "62:50", "fat to carbohydrates as as this as a", "62:53", "fuel substrate I thought I was gonna", "62:56", "come up organically but it didn't do the", "62:59", "trifecta five prep systems you guys", "63:01", "didn't your team were going to 22 events", "63:02", "this year indeed take it away all right", "63:06", "what are you doing so I'm shooting a", "63:08", "promo here Joe so essentially we're", "63:13", "assessing and then we're programming", "63:15", "based on each athletes needs so like for", "63:17", "said one of our most valuable partners", "63:21", "at the UFC performances two is this meal", "63:23", "prep company called trifecta nutrition", "63:25", "and and they essentially have all", "63:28", "organic meal line that can be developed", "63:32", "all a cart ordered all a cart and so", "63:34", "with kymaro as an example we worked", "63:36", "together for his

to", "80:40", "whether or not that's good or bad like", "80:41", "what are your thoughts on that well I", "80:42", "think what Heather who's our director", "80:44", "director of PT I'll tell you is

percent", "81:14", "imbalance in the joint within your body", "81:16", "you know the seventy to ninety percent", "81:19", "chance of injuring that joint right so", "81:21", "just the the the

the clinic and the therapy is", "81:48", "somewhere where you go in you're injured", "81:49", "well you know what we do is we promote", "81:51", "it just as much as a strength and", "81:53",

for sure but again it's it's you know", "82:02", "the fighters tend to be pretty flexible", "82:04", "so again it's it's on an individual", "82:06", "level but most strikers most people can", "82:08",

so say if a fighter", "82:56", "came in and they did a hard grappling", "82:59", "workout and after the training what", "83:02", "would you recommend and how much time", "83:04", "because there's there's some thought", "83:05", "that the body should exist in an", "83:07", "inflamed state post-workout to fall", "83:10", "zones on the face of training so yeah", "83:13", "right and also for a certain amount of", "83:15", "time right and then there's more of a", "83:17", "benefit of going into cryotherapy after", "83:19", "like an hour or so so where the benefits", "83:21", "and again if you're off camp what are", "83:24", "you trying to do you're trying to break", "83:26", "down your body so it can be overloaded", "83:28", "and recover better you know you using", "83:31", "that super

"83:54", "different approaches and different", "83:55", "modalities that you've got to utilize so", "83:58", "if you look at grappling and the", "84:00", "metabolic demand that goes into the",

those metabolites are circling", "84:12", "around the body you got to remove those", "84:13", "all right so is that gonna be something", "84:15", "like a muscle pump type recovery", "84:18", "strategy that'll help it remove it", "84:20", "through the through the liver and into", "84:21", "the lymph system I mean like one of", "84:22", "those compressions so yeah it might be a", "84:24",

"84:40", "preferred methodology right now it's", "84:42", "about three three to four minutes four", "84:44", "times in each finishing can't go back", "84:47", "and forth four minutes finishing the",

there's", "84:56", "still not the science not the data and", "84:59", "the information out there to really", "85:00", "support somehow yeah how do you optimize", "85:03", "me how do you know whether or not it's", "85:06", "having that much of a benefit compared", "85:08", "to not doing that ask the guy yeah just", "85:10", "I'll suggest are to make away you know", "85:14", "yeah number one subjective do you feel", "85:17", "better you know that there might be no", "85:19", "science around cryotherapy I'm not", "85:20", "suggesting not but there might be no no", "85:22", "dates or no science on it but if the guy", "85:24", "walks out three minutes later and feels", "85:25", "like crystal mind and his body is fresh", "85:28", "I mean it's kind of worked right yeah", "85:30", "well the norepinephrine the the raising", "85:32", "of the levels of it dude the extreme", "85:34", "cold exposure I think that's been proven", "85:36", "I think cytokine develop cold char", "85:41",

"like it I'm just making the point that", "85:51", "if you like that stimulation and you", "85:53", "like that sensation and you walk out you", "85:54", "can forget the physiology kiss now it's", "85:56", "laughing into psychology and that's", "85:58", "still part of the recovery process yes", "85:59", "is it's beneficial Fisher", "86:05", "I will sidetrack just in terms of", "86:08",

critical what we aren't", "86:27", "doing is providing tart cherry juice or", "86:29", "hide antioxidants immediately post", "86:31", "training as well that yeah what we'll", "86:33", "include that in other periods of the day", "86:34", "in the evening or not are not", "86:37", "immediately around a high-intensity", "86:38", "training session for antioxidant effect", "86:41", "of antioxidants post training similar it", "86:44", "limits it blunts the adaptive response", "86:47", "based on the the body's recovery process", "86:50", "so if you if you blunt your immune", "86:53", "response to to a micro trauma muscle", "86:58", "tears that need to be rebuilt stronger", "87:00", "and faster well then you limit the", "87:02", "adaptation so yeah we want to provide", "87:04", "nutrients to support recovery but we", "87:06", "don't want to eliminate the adaptive", "87:08", "response to to the training session", "87:10", "that's what's so fascinating about the", "87:11", "science of it that you can get that that", "87:13", "specific that you know that if you", "87:15", "consume the high levels antioxidants", "87:17", "post-training it's going to blunt the", "87:18", "recovery time that's you have to so yeah", "87:20", "it's amazing curcumin tart cherry juice", "87:22", "there's a number of spices that are", "87:25", "included in a lot of different things so", "87:27", "whether it's cooking or or in our", "87:28", "supplement protocol that we will include", "87:30", "but we're gonna target them away from", "87:32", "the high intense how far away from the", "87:33", "high intensity to a couple hours couple", "87:35", "hours I mean it comes back to you know", "87:37", "kind of fights a kind of Coach process", "87:39", "all this information right you know can", "87:41", "they physically be aware of it what are", "87:43", "the catcher give me the bag so again let", "87:48", "us do some of the grunt work yeah", "87:49", "Performance Institute and we can give", "87:51", "you some of that education I'll tell you", "87:54", "how I feel and then we'll come back", "87:55", "we'll talk about it maybe a changes", "87:57", "coaches and gyms don't have to feel like", "87:58", "you're trying to poach them and take", "88:00", "them away and bring them to a new play", "88:01", "that's a beautiful thing about it's like", "88:03", "it's open to everybody who fights for", "88:04", "the user and the other thing which oh", "88:05", "say is this this isn't no cost to the", "88:07", "fighters Yeah right it's also their", "88:09", "choice well they're independent", "88:11", "contractors they can decide how much", "88:13", "they want to engage with us as much or", "88:15", "as little as they want and again that's", "88:16", "the same with the trifecta program for", "88:18", "meal prep it's is saying with our", "88:19", "strength and conditioning program so", "88:21", "again it's it's all bespoke and", "88:22", "customized program in it they're", "88:24", "expected at no cost it's it's so", "88:26", "exciting for me because having seen the", "88:28", "fight the fights in the the sport and", "88:31", "the level of sport evolve over all these", "88:33", "years", "88:34", "it's so", "88:34", "exciting to see constant and continuing", "88:36", "innovation and when you guys came along", "88:38", "and built this thing and I had a chance", "88:40", "to go and visit I was so excited because", "88:43", "like this is just as what man every", "88:45", "sport needs something like this but the", "88:46", "fact that the UFC has do some testing", "88:49", "come by do some testing old where are", "88:53", "you more old than other yeah right now", "88:55", "my left hip I fell down skiing we make", "88:57", "it great sorry you make a great point", "88:59", "because what's what's been one of the", "89:00", "really exciting things for us and", "89:02", "refreshing and also for the UFC", "89:04", "Performance Institute is that sports", "89:06", "like the NFL the NBA you know the", "89:09", "English Premier League we're having", "89:10", "representatives from all of these teams", "89:12", "NHL coming through and trying to", "89:14", "understand or just be trying to", "89:16", "understand what we're doing how we work", "89:18", "in our sport science into the sport of", "89:20", "mixed martial arts and to try and", "89:21", "capture our philosophy and our approach", "89:23", "from a facility development perspective", "89:25", "through to kind of our educational", "89:27", "processes through to the way we're", "89:28", "interacting with fighters and again", "89:30", "we're trying to shake mixed martial arts", "89:31", "which are no influence at UFC that's", "89:33", "that's an that's our number one mission", "89:35", "but the the the the global awareness", "89:38", "round around the performance Institute", "89:39", "is really exciting as well now I know", "89:41", "you guys you were talking about your", "89:43", "place in China are you planning on going", "89:45", "anywhere else well right now you know", "89:47", "the expectation of our desire is to", "89:50", "influence mixed martial arts globally", "89:52", "we're truly a global sport so and right", "89:55", "now we don't know what that's gonna look", "89:56", "like but the ambition is to obviously", "89:58", "have performance Institute's around the", "90:00", "world that can help the development", "90:01", "process on a building like South Africa", "90:03", "mm-hmm", "90:04", "badass over there get the malaria", "90:07", "medication ready bro huh cipro right", "90:08", "it's a pro I don't know what that stuff", "90:10", "is he just wants the red wine oh it's", "90:12", "pretty master what is cool about is", "90:14", "about us operating and athletes being", "90:16", "independent contractors and accessing us", "90:18", "however they see fit is we have so many", "90:21", "different case studies and utilization", "90:23", "we'll have people come out for a week at", "90:25", "a time access our team take that back", "90:28", "well have other people come out for a", "90:29", "part of a camp or a full camp others", "90:31", "will come we had mesa barber actually", "90:34", "she talked about it publicly but she she", "90:36", "worked with us quite a bit for her last", "90:38", "fight she booked a flight from Nashville", "90:41", "to Vegas to reconnect to get updated", "90:44", "nutrition strengthen conditioning or", "90:46", "whatever whatever metrics that week", "90:48", "update based on her health status as", "90:49", "well as orthopedic support post fight so", "90:52", "we were able to get a number of days", "90:54", "post fight as part of essentially the", "90:57", "completion of her fight camp to get her", "90:59", "ready for the next phase so there's a", "91:01", "lot of different ways that athletes can", "91:02", "utilize based on just whatever their", "91:04", "needs are whatever they perceive their", "91:06", "needs it needs to be and then whatever", "91:08", "influence were able to kind of make over", "91:11", "over there preparation and Maci barber", "91:13", "is a perfect example of someone getting", "91:14", "that kind of high level treatment very", "91:16", "early in her career she's only 20 years", "91:18", "old right no super exciting prospect and", "91:20", "for her to have access to 21 like 3", "91:24", "weeks she's older a days over the hill", "91:26", "that that voice is Forrest Griffin", "91:28", "ladies and gentlemen no one else when", "91:31", "you when you treat these younger", "91:34", "fighters how much emphasis do you put on", "91:37", "giving them just some just a smart", "91:42", "protocol to try to minimize the", "91:44", "potential injuries like to get them to", "91:46", "understand the relationship between", "91:48", "range of motion and injuries to get them", "91:50", "to understand balance I know you guys", "91:52", "have a machine that you actually can", "91:53", "measure the muscles in the body and show", "91:55", "like the left and the right side what's", "91:57", "what's what's week and what's strong", "91:58", "right what does that call again", "91:59", "I mean it's we use fullest plates in", "92:01", "instant in particular and there's", "92:03", "something you like down in those there", "92:06", "so we have the DEXA scan which is", "92:08", "essentially you know a low-dose x-ray", "92:11", "that measures the the mass of the tissue", "92:14", "between bone mass muscle mass and fat", "92:17", "mass and so we can get a balance of the", "92:21", "musculature and the skeleton bilaterally", "92:23", "when we when we see a big imbalance on", "92:26", "that front because that is a nutrition", "92:28", "related test we will share that with", "92:30", "both physical therapy and strength and", "92:32", "conditioning and then physical therapy", "92:34", "could break that into more nuance around", "92:35", "strength imbalances around joints using", "92:38", "the bio decks and then strength and", "92:39", "conditioning will do very similar kind", "92:42", "of understanding using the the bio", "92:44", "lateral force plates that stupid machine", "92:46", "told me I had two pounds less muscle on", "92:48", "my left leg am i right it was accurate", "92:50", "oh yeah no I do I blew my day out a", "92:52", "couple times but I just didn't really so", "92:56", "when you found out did you start doing", "92:57", "like extra one-legged pistols on the", "92:59", "left side for two weeks maybe even", "93:01", "three and then I was like yeah I got", "93:03", "some emails to send any niece died and", "93:06", "now he just keeps running circles let me", "93:08", "ask you this if you did see a fighter", "93:09", "and they did have something like that", "93:11", "and they were active they're still", "93:12", "competing you saw all the time what do", "93:14", "you do yeah I mean we have a lot of", "93:16", "fighters that have imbalances muscularly", "93:17", "that that's that's not a", "93:19", "nutrition-related", "93:21", "obviously our support is going to be", "93:23", "important for the adaptation right and", "93:25", "this goes to Heather around an", "93:27", "orthopedic assessment what are what it", "93:29", "what's the imbalance what's the injury", "93:31", "risk like duncan was saying in terms of", "93:33", "strength and balances she and her team", "93:36", "heather linden are our director of PT", "93:38", "would would do that orthopaedic screen", "93:40", "see what the imbalances are and break it", "93:43", "down and then that would lead to", "93:44", "probably programming in her space and", "93:46", "then also to strengthen conditioning to", "93:48", "build programs around whether it's", "93:50", "mobility range of motion or just around", "93:52", "it kind of hypertrophy to make up for", "93:54", "some imbalances so that's where the", "93:56", "comprehensive approach comes in i might", "93:58", "assess something and then kick it over", "94:00", "to them there's many cases where they", "94:02", "would assess something whether the", "94:03", "strength coach happened this week", "94:05", "so-and-so is having a bad training", "94:09", "session they talk about low energy they", "94:11", "talk about not not being able to recover", "94:12", "or get up for the next training session", "94:13", "that's an immediate referral over to my", "94:16", "session to my side of the defense so", "94:18", "that's where the integrated care becomes", "94:20", "really really critical so how if you had", "94:23", "someone that had like two pound weight", "94:25", "difference between their left leg in the", "94:26", "right leg how much time would you give", "94:28", "them the gain that way back would be", "94:29", "dependent upon the individual or like", "94:30", "you would probably want that to be a", "94:32", "priority before they went into a heavy", "94:34", "camp or something like that okay you", "94:35", "can't resolve that immediately but that", "94:37", "would be part of the I mean it comes", "94:39", "back to the the return on investment", "94:41", "right what's the return on investment to", "94:44", "and the reduction of an injury risk to", "94:47", "try and influence that two pounds you", "94:49", "know I mean that's a conversation that's", "94:52", "you know we're gonna have that", "94:54", "conversation on how effective or", "94:56", "influential that is going to be on the", "94:57", "outcome of the fight so you know that's", "94:59", "Clint says as fighters at what round", "95:00", "truly imbalanced and but what's the risk", "95:03", "and the time and effort it's going to", "95:05", "take to make that change if it's in a", "95:06", "fight camp we're probably going to just", "95:08", "leave it as it is if it's off camp and", "95:09", "we've got a little bit more time to try", "95:11", "and address it all right now we can be a", "95:12", "bit more proactive about but with me", "95:14", "they were like you're all what", "95:15", "take you out back and shoot you now they", "95:17", "did we messed around with some VFR stuff", "95:20", "yeah VFR blood flow restriction your", "95:23", "occlusion behind zoo type approach but", "95:26", "again in physical therapy and strength", "95:28", "condition now that's not revolutionary", "95:30", "anymore that that's that's part of just", "95:32", "another tool that we are to it it's it's", "95:34", "a way to come to argument and or", "95:37", "accelerate hypertrophy so if you have", "95:39", "someone that's coming back for returning", "95:41", "from surgery or an injury and you're", "95:43", "looking to get muscle mass back on to", "95:45", "and the limb without necessarily loading", "95:47", "it through free weights or whatever it", "95:48", "may be you can use blood flow", "95:50", "restriction methods to try and increase", "95:52", "the hypertrophy mechanism what are you", "95:54", "thoughts on electrical muscular", "95:56", "stimulation those little pads and shot", "95:58", "ceased no no that is called Heather yeah", "96:02", "what they they come by a lot with", "96:04", "different machines to using I have not", "96:09", "no well no actually no that's not true I", "96:11", "was the test dummy I think with a lot of", "96:16", "things with some short-term relief and", "96:18", "again you're influenced the nervous", "96:20", "system the long-term changes are", "96:22", "potentially not there here's our ask you", "96:24", "about cupping so legit yeah is
