trials", "00:13", "they they take place at different sites", "00:15", "so they have multiple you know locations", "00:17", "that are testing so that they can get", "00:19", "data on different populations and you", "00:21", "know not just in white you know", "00:23", "Americans also Chinese people and you", "00:26", "know so they do it different centers and", "00:28", "so there was a it was a trial for an", "00:30", "anticoagulant drug and they found that", "00:35", "this Chinese Center had falsified a", "00:37", "whole bunch of patient data and changed", "00:39", "the results and if they took that", "00:41", "Chinese center's data out of the", "00:44", "equation the drug would have failed it", "00:46", "wouldn't have been more effective than", "00:48", "placebo but even though the FDA busted", "00:51", "this group in China the study that was", "00:55", "published on that drug still included", "00:58", "that data from the study in China and", "01:00", "even studies that were being published", "01:02", "eighteen months later still included", "01:04", "that data in the original data set so", "01:07", "the FDA busted them it was clear that", "01:09", "they had falsified the data and yet that", "01:11", "data is still being included in the", "01:13", "studies that doctors are relying on all", "01:15", "over the world to make decisions about", "01:17", "whether to

being reported and translating", "01:30", "into clinical decisions that that", "01:32", "doctors are making so there are a lot of", "01:35", "and then the whole peer review process", "01:37", "you mentioned peer review too there was", "01:40", "a pretty big study where they the a", "01:45", "paper was submitted to BMJ British", "01:48", "Medical Journal another big medical", "01:49", "journal with eight major errors and not", "01:52", "a single one of the 221 scientists that", "01:54", "were asked to review the paper caught", "01:56", "all of the errors and only thirty", "01:58", "percent recommended rejecting the paper", "02:00", "and this was even more problematic", "02:03", "because half of those scientists were", "02:06", "warned in advance we're going to give", "02:08", "you a

the news", "02:53", "there was a recent the open science", "02:56", "collaboration did a review of a hundred", "02:59", "psychology studies and that had never", "03:01", "been replicated replicating and findings", "03:04", "is really important in the scientific", "03:06", "method too like if you design a study", "03:08", "and you do it and you have you find a", "03:10", "certain result in science it's not", "03:13", "really considered to be valid unless I", "03:15", "do it and and confirm your results you", "03:18", "know or someone else does it's", "03:19", "independent of you and in a shocking", "03:22", "number of studies this never happens and", "03:24", "so they this group went back and looked", "03:26", "at a hundred psychology studies and", "03:28", "tried to replicate them using the you", "03:30", "know almost identical conditions from", "03:32", "the original studies and and they were", "03:35", "only able to do that in thirty five", "03:36", "percent of cases well there another", "03:39", "group looked at at pre cancer clinical", "03:43", "studies and found they could only", "03:44", "replicate 11% of those it's a well-known", "03:47", "saying in the

company tried to do that", "03:58", "in 2011 they took a bunch of trials and", "04:01", "tried to replicate them less than", "04:03", "one-quarter of them they were able to", "04:04", "replicate the results so what this means", "04:06", "is you know a study can be done it's", "04:11", "never validated and then a whole bunch", "04:13", "of other studies are done that refer to", "04:15", "that study and whole fields of", "04:18", "scientific research are spawned on a", "04:20", "study that was never confirmed or", "04:22", "validated so it's like a house", "04:24", "of cards built on a foundation of", "04:26", "falsehood well so you know science is", "04:30", "great we need to keep improving science", "04:32", "but there's a lot of problems with the", "04:34", "way the studies are
