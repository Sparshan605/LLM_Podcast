the punchline", "10:34", "and so is somewhere when those two", "10:37", "things collide in a group of people if", "10:40", "it it will trigger a reaction and if", "10:43", "it's laugh at laughter in that moment", "10:46", "it's it's understanding a paradox it's", "10:49", "like feeling the effects of a paradox", "10:51", "where it actually like write you a very", "10:54", "unique moment a grazie

everything and", "11:03", "nothing simultaneously like you get that", "11:05", "quick like because a joke kind of does", "11:07", "that at least in my opinion and and and", "11:09", "that makes you feel like it gives", "11:11", "everyone a sense of enlightenment for", "11:14", "for a moment I know what you're saying I", "11:16", "don't think a joke does it the way a", "11:17", "psychedelic

"12:25", "hypnosis yeah if you're talking about", "12:29", "the effect on people or and you tend the", "12:32", "idea what's happened I think the", "12:33", "comedian as well because I feel like", "12:34", "it's my job to put all the pieces", "12:37", "together and practice it and just tweak", "12:40", "it and to but when I get on stage and it", "12:42", "starts happening I feel like I'm as much", "12:43", "of a passenger as I am the driver oh man", "12:46", "yeah that's a really great description", "12:49", "yeah I agree with that 100% I mean you", "12:51", "know like sometimes I'll say

together right I think that", "24:26", "there are companies and if not there are", "24:28", "moments when companies are like that", "24:30", "yeah you know and because everything", "24:31", "changes so it might not be sustainable", "24:33", "if we keep going I feel like you know", "24:36", "people don't people like to look at the", "24:38", "worst aspects of any point in time right", "24:40",

"24:49", "overall it's pretty undeniable this is", "24:51", "the best time ever to be alive in terms", "24:54", "of health care in terms of you know with", "24:57", "the science behind keeping people alive", "24:58", "in terms of your ability to get", "25:01", "information in terms of our ability to", "25:03", "communicate with each other and bullshit", "25:06", "to get through to us like it's way less", "25:08", "likely that bullshit gets through to", "25:09", "people today than the propaganda they", "25:11", "could spew just in like the 1960s Oh get", "25:14", "over on us that's mean the gulf of", "25:15", "tonkin thing like the whole thing the", "25:16", "whole reason what we got into war so I", "25:18", "just think that if we can keep it", "25:20", "together and we can keep going I think", "25:22", "40 years from now 50 years from now", "25:24", "that's gonna I think we're gonna realize", "25:26", "that that should be the norm and that", "25:28", "the really healthy communities is going", "25:30", "to be the norm and all these things this", "25:32", "is like almost like aberrations that we", "25:35", "when we look back in time and thinking", "25:37", "like people who were kings and they had", "25:38", "people under them and they executed", "25:40", "people at their own whim and that you", "25:42", "know they don't exist in a few places", "25:43", "today", "25:44", "it's like North Korea and like maybe a", "25:46", "couple other places mm-hmm I feel like", "25:48", "in the future we're all gonna move", "25:50", "towards it we're just it's just hard to", "25:52", "see why we're in it we're all moving", "25:54", "towards a", "25:54", "better way of living yeah yeah I mean", "25:56", "that I mean I think of it you know if I", "25:59", "if I go back to that like the reality", "26:03", "awareness issue or the idea that you", "26:07", "know there are multiverses and that", "26:09", "every choice splits off and makes", "26:11", "another choice makes another choice so", "26:12", "in essence if just a yeah that in", "26:16", "essence if anything is possible if if", "26:18", "the amount of realities and", "26:20", "possibilities that exists are infinite", "26:23", "and but we're like perceiving one point", "26:26", "you know yeah as a whatever", "26:28", "consciousness experiment or whatever you", "26:29", "want to call it but as your point of", "26:31", "reference as you move in every choice", "26:33", "that you make you can actually steer", "26:34", "yourself to the reality that you want to", "26:36", "live in so I mean I think that there's a", "26:39", "there's something great about seeing the", "26:42", "trajectory of what you just described", "26:44", "and moving towards that future yeah but", "26:47", "being proactive in the way that you can", "26:49", "and but I think really the I think the", "26:53", "thing that's really going to help all of", "26:54", "that is energy like if we can figure out", "26:57", "a way to distribute energy so that it's", "26:59", "more equal amongst all human beings on", "27:02", "the planet right like something you mean", "27:04", "energy in terms of power actual power", "27:06", "yeah like well power in power yeah I", "27:09", "would feel like there's a lot of places", "27:11", "in the earth that would benefit from", "27:13", "some super advanced form of solar yes", "27:15", "like free energy yeah I mean because if", "27:17", "yeah for sure yeah why even ever have", "27:20", "power plants do I have any of that stuff", "27:22", "now can all be independent and we don't", "27:24", "total I on a grid either this way no no", "27:26", "no it distributed power is the is the", "27:28", "best power especially if it is connected", "27:31", "because then you have it can manage", "27:33", "itself I mean even if like you know", "27:35", "artificial intelligence things like that", "27:36", "or just really good programming", "27:38", "it just optimizes constantly in", "27:40", "real-time based on a sensor array well", "27:43", "you know they use really good", "27:45", "backcountry solar panels to charge", "27:47", "batteries for cameras and phones that's", "27:51", "right my friend Adam was in Montana and", "27:53", "he was in Colorado Montana Idaho and", "27:56", "Wyoming went on this epic backcountry", "27:59", "hunt and one of the things that he did", "28:00", "is he brought this solar thing to charge", "28:03", "his phone every day do insta stories", "28:05", "from the top of the mountain", "28:06", "yeah amazing amazing stuff but that you", "28:09", "couldn't do that just a few years ago I", "28:10", "mean there was no the kind of solar", "28:12", "power that you could pack up and a", "28:13", "little thing and stuff into your", "28:15", "backpack it's crazy I know yeah I was", "28:17", "checking out there's a company out of", "28:19", "Australia that makes these solar", "28:20", "generators and they're they're like 17", "28:22", "grand or something like that or maybe", "28:24", "even oh no they meant even more like 30", "28:26", "grand so anyways it's this like fairly", "28:28", "lightweight system it's like a mast", "28:30", "system that has a base and and a solar", "28:34", "array and it tracks the Sun so moves", "28:38", "automatically with the Sun and it", "28:39", "accounts like it also has like some", "28:41", "other program the weather data that's", "28:43", "also integrated into it either real-time", "28:45", "or stored and so it it but it's able to", "28:48", "produce like a pretty decent amount of", "28:50", "electricity I don't remember the numbers", "28:52", "but it was definitely way more than a", "28:54", "trickle charge you could almost like you", "28:57", "could run a refrigeration system on it", "28:59", "like a small refrigeration so you can", "29:01", "keep food from perishing yeah you know", "29:03", "maybe even get some air conditioning", "29:04", "going or something yeah I think with a", "29:07", "storage battery 20 years from now who", "29:08", "knows how this shit is gonna be well I", "29:11", "mean you know if you I just got done", "29:13", "seeing that a documentary I don't know I", "29:17", "don't remember the name of it but it's a", "29:18", "kind of kind of conspiracy UFO what you", "29:22", "want", "29:23", "it's those a fairly recent one yeah it's", "29:24", "fairly Steven Greer guy I not sure it's", "29:28", "on iTunes is featured on iTunes do you", "29:32", "remember the name of it I can find it", "29:33", "what the unknown yeah yeah seems right I", "29:41", "yeah an acknowledge did you like it", "29:44", "there's our belly there's acid it was", "29:47", "kind of our belly actually art by those", "29:49", "are tough shows for me to watch because", "29:51", "it makes sense like some of the stuff", "29:55", "that they're talking about yeah that", "29:56", "makes sense but my theory is that the", "29:59", "level of organization that they're", "30:02", "talking about doesn't really exist", "30:05", "like it's not that tight I think I think", "30:08", "it's kind of messy I think it's it's the", "30:10", "same thing like just look at kids on a", "30:12", "playground and see how they organize", "30:14", "themselves", "30:15", "yes socially and then just expand that", "30:17", "with a little bit more complex", "30:19", "today or more complexity and you have", "30:21", "these this idea of like the secrecy the", "30:23", "structure of secrecy and yeah you know", "30:27", "ancient a like cults that have now risen", "30:31", "you know Rosicrucians and masons and the", "30:36", "Illuminati in those types of things I", "30:38", "think that does they can like that sort", "30:42", "of thing does exist but it doesn't exist", "30:44", "in the tight efficient controlled", "30:48", "version that I think it's I think it's", "30:51", "messier than that I think it's people", "30:52", "trying to influence other people using a", "30:56", "bunch of tactics but I think that you", "30:59", "can't have control you can't have that", "31:01", "much control as as much control as", "31:04", "they're talking about well the only way", "31:05", "that would work is if the government was", "31:07", "different than people like if they", "31:10", "weren't if it was made of people yeah it", "31:13", "wasn't people yeah they were so smart", "31:15", "that they weren't people that's not the", "31:21", "case Donald Trump is the fucking", "31:23", "president yeah we have proof that the", "31:24", "government is filled with people guys a", "31:27", "person you know person right yeah so no", "31:30", "person has ever been able to pulled off", "31:33", "that level of conspiracy for any length", "31:36", "of time and the idea that you could hide", "31:38", "somehow communication with aliens yes", "31:41", "and that the aliens would choose the", "31:43", "government of all people why would the", "31:45", "aliens give a fuck who we picked in a", "31:47", "popularity contest", "31:48", "oh that's the representative that gets", "31:50", "to speak to Zeta Reticuli yes they talk", "31:54", "to whoever they want man go and check", "31:56", "when we visit a bee colony excuse me", "32:03", "suck some bees out the back you take", "32:06", "them to a lab test just listen I need", "32:08", "you to go back to the Queen we need to", "32:11", "go to the king you imagine some fucking", "32:13", "dude sitting in the White House you know", "32:15", "at the Oval Office and the alien walks", "32:17", "in I am the representative it doesn't", "32:24", "make any sense I believe I believe in", "32:27", "like so many things so infinitely that", "32:31", "things can exist", "32:32", "some things are possible however there", "32:33", "are things that are just like it just", "32:35", "makes sense you know it intuitively you", "32:37", "can feel some connection to real like", "32:39", "you know what I'll leave a ten percent", "32:41", "margin of possibility you know like you", "32:43", "know something like that ideas where I'm", "32:45", "like I can't I just can't I", "32:48", "it could be real but I've seen nothing", "32:50", "that compels me to believe that it is", "32:52", "but it could be real I'm definitely not", "32:54", "saying there are no aliens or the", "32:55", "government has been contacted by aliens", "32:57", "of aliens having visited sure sure I", "33:00", "mean why not you mean it I mean I I", "33:02", "don't think it's impossible but again I", "33:05", "think it's not in to the extent at which", "33:07", "yeah when you compress all the data and", "33:10", "you like formulate a story about it you", "33:12", "know it's really unlikely yeah it's like", "33:14", "well I don't know it seems you you have", "33:17", "to you kind of have to do that like you", "33:19", "can't talk about that stuff it also", "33:22", "slightly super likely to me that in the", "33:24", "future we won't send biological entities", "33:26", "into these places they don't have all", "33:28", "these limitations as far as like what we", "33:30", "can survive we'll send some sort of an", "33:32", "artificial intelligence yeah maybe", "33:34", "that's what those things are those great", "33:35", "things the big black eyes", "33:37", "maybe those are robots oh man but then", "33:40", "the question is is it's you know my", "33:42", "theory is that the whole our propulsion", "33:44", "or their compulsion to to constantly be", "33:47", "making technology right it's based on", "33:49", "our desire to make or build ourselves", "33:53", "outside of ourselves", "33:54", "yeah so without the the the normal", "33:57", "biological means it's like we're", "33:59", "fascinating and we're fascinated at", "34:00", "simulating ourselves outside of", "34:03", "ourselves yeah and so in essence we", "34:05", "could just be that already right and so", "34:09", "so it's like we're just like on this", "34:11", "constant carrot chasing propulsion", "34:15", "system yeah there's a lot of people that", "34:17", "when they look at the image of the alien", "34:19", "they they look at that image and they", "34:21", "say that it's entirely preposterous that", "34:24", "someone would achieve or something would", "34:26", "achieve a humanoid like shape with all", "34:28", "the massive amounts of different shapes", "34:32", "that we have on earth yes right right", "34:34", "it's just to be mobile that's not the", "34:35", "only way to be mobile and know we know", "34:37", "how ours came to be that we used to be", "34:39", "crawling and then we start standing up", "34:42", "right that's why we have all these", "34:42", "issues with our spine", "34:44", "yeah our spine wasn't entirely designed", "34:46", "to support upper body weight that's", "34:48", "right yeah yeah that's right yeah and", "34:50", "yeah the other thing is it's one of my", "34:53", "pet peeves and I'm just putting this in", "34:54", "this the spectrum of science fiction", "34:57", "every every celestial body every planet", "35:00", "every moon and they all have different", "35:02", "gravities yeah so there's gonna be", "35:04", "different types of creatures not only", "35:07", "that but when they come to our planet", "35:08", "they're gonna need a really strong", "35:09", "exoskeleton suit or they're gonna be so",

"75:55", "fit on you look at this shit and and all", "75:57", "of this is mapped in an environment so", "76:00", "you're holding the guns you look down", "76:02", "you see the gun the gun moves when you", "76:04", "move it", "76:04", "so these people are walking through yes", "76:07", "environment this is insane", "76:10", "so that's so so it's mapped so this is", "76:12", "what you're seeing in the right yeah", "76:14", "and so if certain things you know it", "76:16", "depends on how one-to-one I I hope that", "76:18", "in the future with real-time data", "76:22", "capture or with cloud capture you'll be", "76:25", "able to pick up objects like it'll", "76:27", "actually be able to track up teddy bear", "76:29", "and you reach out and the teddy bears", "76:31", "there it's lined up well so you can", "76:33", "naturally grab it you squeeze it and in", "76:36", "real time the the the system is reading", "76:39", "it so it's actually puppeting all the", "76:41", "objects in the room so yeah and then the", "76:44", "floor rumbles there's steam that comes", "76:47", "out you know kind like a ride but you", "76:49", "are the visual component you're hijacked", "76:52", "so right now it's just ghostbusters is", "76:54", "that what it is Ghostbusters and the", "76:55", "void the void is I think it's public I", "76:59", "think you can go there yeah so the void", "77:02", "but there's a place that's opening up", "77:04", "hopefully in in Los Angeles which is", "77:07", "totally right for because there's a huge", "77:08", "VR community here that Lana Monica yeah", "77:11", "really yeah yeah there's like at least", "77:13", "like five major players in like Santa", "77:17", "Monica area you meet major players what", "77:20", "do you mean by major players like people",

innovating for VR so their", "77:42", "company their production companies that", "77:44", "make WoW videos they think encode they", "77:47", "or they code they create software or", "77:50", "they're just really good at capturing", "77:52", "there's like you know a tie which does", "77:54", "like spherical capture or our volumetric", "77:58", "capture it's called yeah so there's a", "78:00", "lot a lot of people here so the", "78:03", "technology is here and it's always being", "78:05", "innovated but at warehouse scale is the", "78:07", "perfect marriage for people especially", "78:09", "in LA who like to be active and might", "78:12", "feel weird about sitting down in a chair", "78:14", "and just staring at a screen control", "78:17", "in their hand but they can understand", "78:18", "naturalistic movement right right and", "78:20", "you can in a warehouse scale you can", "78:21", "actually see the size of the room and", "78:23", "feel the breath of the space so in that", "78:27", "particular video it seemed like they had", "78:29", "chairs and tables and everything like", "78:31", "that but the actual textures on those", "78:33", "chair that was all added later yes all", "78:36", "that the ground objects were real yes", "78:38", "but they look so different some of the", "78:40", "objects yeah yeah like the major", "78:42", "obstacle the chair was crazy because", "78:45", "they have a chair in the videogame that", "78:47", "was it seemed to me to be very different", "78:49", "like the British totally that's art", "78:51", "minutes now it's not one-to-one it's", "78:52", "just like it's just a basic", "78:54", "representation", "78:55", "well it's saying in the future you'll", "78:57", "actually be able to just have like a", "78:58", "movie set yeah and the system will be", "79:00", "able to it will already have a", "79:02", "pre-loaded priests can't you know sized", "79:05", "version of that room but then there'll", "79:07", "be sensors that are real-time", "79:08", "calibrating it not sure that it's like", "79:10", "rock-solid so when you reach out you're", "79:12", "like oh I don't feel like I had to move", "79:14", "my hand a little higher to grab this", "79:15", "right you can just reach out it's right", "79:16", "there that's a one-for-one", "79:17", "representation do you think that the", "79:19", "chair is bearing up to the ground Wow", "79:21", "look at these people are walking through", "79:22", "there yeah where is this that they're", "79:24", "doing that this was called VR Studio B", "79:27", "arcade this might have been in yeah vrj", "79:29", "iteration and yeah this is fucking", "79:32", "insane and this is the future man it's", "79:34", "gonna be really really weird and I mean", "79:37", "it's gonna be so weird", "79:39", "I mean imagine like if the mapping", "79:41", "becomes so like rock-solid that you", "79:43", "could reliably run up a flight of stairs", "79:45", "oh my god I mean that sounds like it", "79:49", "sounds like it's like it's not it's not", "79:52", "and then once it comes becomes Wireless", "79:54", "I mean remember when the only way to get", "79:56", "internet yeah the only way to get to the", "79:58", "internet was to have an Ethernet cable", "80:00", "connected to your device right", "80:01", "yeah that's silly I don't have an", "80:03", "Ethernet cable anywhere no I know where", "80:05", "to get one the only problem with VR is", "80:07", "that the processing power so for a while", "80:09", "it had to be tethered to a PC right now", "80:11", "they have PC backpacks well now I", "80:14", "- you what they're gonna have is like", "80:16", "one of those you know you get one those", "80:17", "five charge battery packs for a phone", "80:20", "well yeah recharge yeah yeah totally", "80:22", "see I'm one of those bitches it's gonna", "80:23", "hook up to your phone yeah and", "80:25", "everything's gonna take place all the", "80:26", "processing is gonna be on your solidly", "80:28", "you're gonna have a blue", "80:28", "- 'the headset and you're gonna be able", "80:30", "to go out into a park and do this yeah", "80:32", "it'll be like bluetooth 515 point oh", "80:35", "yeah friends you just have to walk", "80:37", "across the park like you remember when", "80:39", "you first got an iphone and you had to", "80:42", "do the fingerprint a bunch of times yeah", "80:44", "I can also do sorts of different ways", "80:46", "the side and you're on the back that's", "80:48", "what you have to do okay define your", "80:49", "parameters we're in the park and", "80:51", "everybody will walk through the park", "80:53", "together and crisscross and then once", "80:55", "the computer has enough data they go", "80:56", "okay processing the game begins in ten", "80:59", "yeah and then just transforms let's see", "81:04", "that's the thing it's like you know you", "81:07", "know you have augmented reality and", "81:08", "virtual reality augmented reality was", "81:10", "interesting what microsoft's hololens", "81:11", "uses this real-time like basically can", "81:15", "see the environment around it wrapping", "81:16", "it so it stereoscopically maps it and it", "81:19", "creates a really quick texture map of", "81:22", "the environment that you're in so", "81:23", "imagine that mixed with like the idea", "81:27", "behind I forget the name of the the", "81:29", "project but it was a my early Microsoft", "81:31", "Project where it took it's basically", "81:33", "scraped all relevant types of photos and", "81:36", "like stitched them together and created", "81:37", "virtual 3d environments of locations", "81:40", "based on photographs that are everywhere", "81:42", "on the internet so it could recreate a", "81:44", "plaza in Italy and then using like kind", "81:47", "of interpolation like the AI software", "81:50", "kind of stitching it together blah blah", "81:51", "blah so imagine that existing already", "81:54", "just because people are passing by with", "81:56", "their phones they're taking pictures", "81:57", "they're taking video so all of that data", "81:59", "is now present according to the location", "82:01", "that you're at mixed with headsets that", "82:03", "are able to scan in real time", "82:05", "collectively that also gets processed", "82:08", "and stitched together cross-reference", "82:09", "together so that instantaneously you can", "82:11", "have a mapped almost one for one game", "82:14", "zone in a giant park like pretty quick", "82:17", "and just like how you described it but", "82:19", "like using things that are in the", "82:21", "headset that are tracking in real time", "82:23", "and then transmitting or that are", "82:25", "completely internal to the headset and", "82:27", "then also networked to intelligence to", "82:29", "simultaneously and then also probably", "82:31", "some fake stuff that they can create", "82:33", "visually and with 3d sounds totally yes", "82:37", "see like you know if you're doing an", "82:39", "avatar game you can see the dragons", "82:40", "flying overhead like yeah", "82:41", "oh that's the hololens does that it's", "82:44", "got these two little slits they're not", "82:45", "even like regular speakers there's slits", "82:47", "that are above your ears that are", "82:48", "pointed down it's like almost like a", "82:50", "hypersonic sound you know like sound", "82:52", "that can be basically paper-thin so it", "82:54", "might move the access you can't hear it", "82:55", "and then if I move it back on axis and", "82:58", "you haven't moved your head you'll hear", "82:59", "it specifically in one tiny thin slice", "83:02", "of audio well and so it has to be very", "83:06", "precise so it's a form of that but", "83:08", "they're just pointing down and they can", "83:09", "simulate Dolby 5.1 by normally just", "83:13", "saying think about house Oh crazy like", "83:15", "your ear plugs are right yeah look at", "83:19", "this little tiny a speaker yep there's a", "83:21", "little tiny a speaker when it's in your", "83:23", "ear I mean you can get too loud if I", "83:26", "listen Lily if I listen to music", "83:28", "sometimes it can get too loud with these", "83:30", "then I said I gotta get you better", "83:31", "headphones these are great they're", "83:33", "they're good what's wrong with them come", "83:36", "with ya they're they're okay they just", "83:39", "they have a lot of high-end and yes is", "83:41", "not good for your hearing oh not good", "83:43", "for you here yeah I like things that are", "83:44", "soft on my ears but I can hear clearly", "83:46", "it's about what's prestigious this is", "83:49", "fuck just fucks your ears up I would say", "83:50", "like sure sure I really it depends on", "83:52", "what you're using for I am sure I think", "83:54", "the ear pods mm-hmm actually sound", "83:56", "really fucking great yes I like the ear", "83:58", "pods they're better I like them better", "84:00", "than the headphones that come standard", "84:02", "any time headphones are included they're", "84:04", "like they're okay but they're not like", "84:06", "great I mean on an Apple standard better", "84:09", "than most but the ear pods are more", "84:12", "precise the ear pods just sound natural", "84:13", "they'd sound like I'm really surprised", "84:16", "I'm prepared for them not to sound good", "84:18", "almost every time I use them but they", "84:20", "sound great because they're not they", "84:22", "don't seal the ear this sit in the ear", "84:25", "but the design is so ingenious that even", "84:27", "when I'm working out I'm like I'm like", "84:29", "on the bench getting up jumping around", "84:31", "they're still not falling out and they", "84:34", "sound great the bass sounds all natural", "84:35", "then I'll put it in like a high-end pair", "84:37", "I have like a crazy amount of headphones", "84:39", "and I'll put in some like crazy", "84:41", "headphones like some Oddie's whatever", "84:43", "plan or magnetic bullsh it's like little", "84:47", "tiny ones that don't require much power", "84:48", "a phone would power it fine", "84:49", "but I put those in and I'm like oh wow", "84:52", "that sounds really small like I have to", "84:54", "adjust to its detail whereas they I pod", "84:57", "is like as soon as I put him in like", "84:58", "let's just sounds like a nice perfect", "85:00", "frequency Kurt feels very flat in real", "85:02", "Wow that's a strong at door spent pretty", "85:05", "good yeah I'm really I'm really I was", "85:08", "like very impressed with them I bought", "85:10", "them and I never opened the box really", "85:11", "yeah they're easy to pair man and it's", "85:14", "cool because I just have me my jeans all", "85:16", "the time right a little easier to handle", "85:18", "then this wire yeah that wire gets", "85:20", "fucked up yeah you just like I just pull", "85:22", "it out and it's so fun because the way", "85:24", "it snaps closed and magnetically is so", "85:26", "satisfying how long is the battery life", "85:28", "lasts no suckers I think it's eight", "85:30", "hours really I think with the case the", "85:32", "charge case recharges right there yeah", "85:35", "where does their pair at the Apple watch", "85:37", "to see I have the new Apple watch did", "85:40",

reading about Satchell escarole be", "128:15", "able to put even cholesterol cholesterol", "128:17", "is the precursor it's like what you need", "128:20", "it's a substrate for hormones sure sure",

get it to a powder right", "132:19", "but that's what I would say that there", "132:20", "the issue is in the dehydration", "132:22", "rehydration process it's so different", "132:24", "than with hemp

that's that's the", "172:47", "technical term for drive one well we're", "172:50", "gonna long for the days where engines", "172:52", "were real one day we're gonna be like", "172:54", "remember when Beckwith Kern's made", "172:55", "noises and you can hear them coming yeah", "172:57", "totally", "172:58", "don't be like I am remember we're used", "172:59", "to drive them yeah mm-hmm that was my", "173:02", "favorite scene in iRobot he's like I'm", "173:04", "going manual they're going like 300", "173:06", "miles per hour and then the computer", "173:07", "said all right now the person in the", "173:09", "faster said are you crazy going to", "173:10", "switching to manual at these speeds I", "173:12", "love that yeah one day that'll be a", "173:16", "thing in the past the spherical wheels", "173:18", "though I mean come on that was sick", "173:19", "yeah the car could rotate while it's", "173:21", "still maintaining the same speed forward", "173:23", "oh yeah that's right and that's coming", "173:26", "to four spheres yeah they have them in", "173:28", "fact factory floor robots or like", "173:30", "forklifts now oh yeah I forget what they", "173:32", "call that type of steering but it's like", "173:36", "crap it's basically crab like so it can", "173:38", "move forward sideways any any way how", "173:40", "many years do you think we have where", "173:42", "it's still able to drive your own car I", "173:43", "think we have probably 10 years 10 years", "173:46", "that sounds about right", "173:47", "yeah yeah I feel like it's gonna creep", "173:50", "in we're gonna realize how much safer it", "173:52", "is people with some some assholes are", "173:54", "gonna fuck up with manual they're gonna", "173:56", "crash into a school or something like", "173:57", "that yeah and then people are gonna go", "173:59", "enough with the manual enough you know", "174:01", "yeah what they'll do semi manual like", "174:03", "you can you can you can steer you can", "174:06", "drive within certain parameters but if", "174:07", "the computer senses you're going off the", "174:09", "rails and look like and guide the car", "174:11", "back well you know that's why it's so", "174:13", "there's such a demand for really old", "174:15", "cars that have like tactile feedback", "174:18", "yeah they're so expensive like if you", "174:21", "buy a 1973 Porsche which is only 150 200", "174:26", "horsepower engine if those things are in", "174:28", "good shape", "174:29", "yeah they're worth a fuck load of money", "174:31", "now true because you feel everything", "174:33", "when you drive that thing yeah every", "174:35", "bump do you drive over you feel the", "174:37", "there's no power steering at all see if", "174:40", "you feel like every turn on the steering", "174:42", "wheel yeah yeah yeah you're you feel the", "174:44", "force that", "174:45", "the wheel has to an interpretation and", "174:47", "when you turn hard it's harder to turn", "174:48", "yeah", "174:49", "wait harder yeah yeah you got it you got", "174:51", "a really got to be present with it every", "174:53", "moment I was like it with like new power", "174:55", "steering you could kind of be", "174:56", "absent-minded be taking a pretty hard", "174:58", "corner yeah is easy to roll the car", "175:00", "well difference in also the newest power", "175:02", "steering even opposed to the last", "175:03", "generations now they go bye-bye sharing", "175:05", "that's electric yeah it's fly-by-wire", "175:07", "you don't feel anything", "175:08", "whereas the hydraulic gave you varying", "175:11", "feedback depending on how much load was", "175:13", "on yeah or rack-and-pinion yeah I always", "175:15", "loved wreck I thought that was the", "175:16", "perfect happy medium yeah well those", "175:20", "really old cars were so light like those", "175:22", "old Porsches and old BMWs like the BMW", "175:25", "2002 no yeah tiny bugs yeah they're so", "175:29", "light you didn't have to have like power", "175:31", "steering yeah well I mean I'm what", "175:33", "people are doing now is they're they're", "175:35", "they're pulling the transmissions and", "175:37", "engines and replacing them with electric", "175:39", "so you still have the road feel and the", "175:41", "handling of it but you get the battery", "175:43", "but you get the you get the battery so", "175:45", "you don't get I mean it's not loud but", "175:46", "you get this great fusion of like you've", "175:48", "got the classic car look but you've got", "175:50", "the speed and the pickup so you can't", "175:53", "like this little tiny BMW mm you're", "175:56", "doing 0 to 60 in 3.5 seconds I saw", "175:58", "somebody did that with a 1965 Mustang", "176:01", "they took a 65 Mustang and turned into", "176:03", "an electric car and it was like to be a", "176:05", "sad it's a beast I know that when you", "176:07", "talk yeah crazy it was you looking at", "176:09", "this classic old-school muscle car and", "176:12", "yet it has like a Tesla underbody yeah", "176:14", "it's like an electric muscle car huh", "176:16", "yeah I mean cut remac you know that", "176:19", "Rimac or Rimac they're Estonian are ima", "176:24", "see they make this electric car for", "176:29", "electric motors motor for each wheel", "176:30", "it's got over a thousand horsepower", "176:32", "Jesus zero to 60 and 3.0 to something", "176:37", "like that three point cheese maybe even", "176:39", "faster than that and or no no no no tell", "176:42", "me", "176:42", "look at that two point three that", "176:45", "thing's insane because my card is two", "176:47", "point three what car do you have", "176:48", "Tesla P 100 e damn son look at this", "176:53", "thing this thing's beautiful it looks", "176:55", "like one of those Lexus who pays those", "176:57", "new lexus coupes", "176:59", "yeah yeah it's amazing yeah see if they", "177:03", "can have like a yeah there you look at", "177:05", "things beautiful yeah it's like it's", "177:09", "crazy and so it does uh it it definitely", "177:11", "does affect oral steering and Vectra", "177:15", "power discs our distribution so if these", "177:18", "things are gorgeous it can corner like a", "177:20", "motherfucker and because the computers", "177:22", "monitoring traction all the time if to", "177:24", "each wheel with an electric motor that", "177:26", "has instantaneous torque you're able to", "177:28", "steer the car with acceleration well so", "177:31", "if you're coming around the corner", "177:32", "depending on the mode and the way that", "177:34", "you're driving you can actually push the", "177:36", "car around the corner with the wheels", "177:39", "using the input from the steering wheel", "177:41", "so your directional steering but also", "177:42", "vecturo steering at the same whoa so", "177:45", "that car is just fast gusting it's just", "177:48", "leaving this Tesla behind yeah just", "177:51", "leaving it leaving it like it's parked", "177:53", "yeah and this guy this guy actually does", "177:55", "some good shit and so now there's like", "177:57", "some like young rich guys throw is the", "177:58", "concept but I like that guy he's gonna", "178:00", "race a Ferrari oh you know it's gonna", "178:02", "bury that Ferrari on the Ferraris", "178:04", "history", "178:04", "it's a LOF it's a lot Ferrari yeah", "178:07", "that's yeah it's a Ferrari laferrari", "178:09", "which is hybrid that's crazy", "178:13", "the Ramat yeah now the remakes gonna win", "178:16", "I know Italy I think so let's say three", "178:19", "two one go oh my god off the line", "178:23", "instantaneously", "178:24", "not even close let's just see you later", "178:27", "I mean it's a linear power curve right", "178:30", "it's an absolutely sure it's a curve", "178:33", "it's just a perfect curve of absolute", "178:36", "power that's insane", "178:37", "now where does one get one of these", "178:39", "Remax uh you know far can they drive", "178:43", "yeah totally", "178:44", "it can go two hundred feet per charge", "178:46", "find out how long those things drive for", "178:49", "it let's take a guess I say they have", "178:51", "220 miles on them what do you say I'm", "178:53", "gonna say I'm gonna say 180 miles 200", "178:58", "miles to 200 much Christine you went low", "178:59", "ball I thought you know high ball on me", "179:01", "top top end of 225 or something like", "179:03", "that or an electric car is a huge deal", "179:05", "what's your Tesla get what's the longest", "179:07", "distance you drive", "179:09", "340 that's pretty goddamn good I'm like", "179:12", "that are three", "179:13", "you think about when Tesla when they", "179:15", "like had a bunch of people what does it", "179:17", "say 2.82 kilowatt can give 205 miles", "179:21", "yeah so they don't specify conceptual", "179:23", "driving the drive cycle yes like a", "179:26", "maniac I'm gonna say 150 yeah maybe not", "179:29", "even yeah 140 what you think about like", "179:31", "during the hurricane in Florida", "179:32", "Tesla released a bunch of these cars", "179:36", "that had they had restrictions on the", "179:39", "amount of distance they could drive oh", "179:42", "yeah and so they did it remotely and", "179:45", "they gave these cars more of a distance", "179:48", "oh yeah yeah yeah they control speed", "179:50", "probably government opted at top speed", "179:51", "no I think they actually literally have", "179:53", "a threshold of how far they're like you", "179:56", "could pay more when you buy them like if", "179:58", "you buy one you could have the option to", "180:00", "have a 250-mile gas tank or a 350-mile", "180:04", "game all day we just unlock it exactly", "180:06", "interesting so the same but kilowatt", "180:08", "battery size kilowatt battery yeah I", "180:10", "don't know about that I don't like that", "180:11", "it's weird right I think I think as long", "180:13", "as the battery system is modular so that", "180:15", "you can add or take away from it without", "180:17", "like huge manufacturing costs of", "180:19", "changing the shape of the battery which", "180:20", "is that which is what Tesla does you can", "180:22", "either like elongate the body of the car", "180:24", "then add more packs yeah or you can", "180:26", "shorten the body of the car narrow it", "180:28", "less packs but I think it'd just be", "180:30", "Packers just fucking people over I just", "180:33", "don't have the capability it's just a", "180:35", "software thing I'm not gonna crossed any", "180:36", "extra money unless the ID this is but", "180:39", "it's so weird it's like well then why", "180:40", "not just make a competitive lease for", "180:42", "the battery capacity that you want or or", "180:44", "there's that they're like but why for", "180:47", "some small price now and if you want to", "180:48", "pay more later we can unlock more", "180:50", "battery but here's the problem instead", "180:52", "of like say if you buy an engine and it", "180:54", "has 800 horsepower and then the you know", "180:56", "there's another option you could buy the", "180:58", "v6 and that only has 350 horsepower", "181:00", "mm-hm sike we're kidding the v6 has 800", "181:02", "horsepower we're not gonna let you use", "181:04", "it cuz you're not paying us that's what", "181:05", "really what it is sure it's because it's", "181:07", "a since we're that battery pack yeah I", "181:09", "don't like that that that I don't like", "181:11", "that doesn't make sense I mean it is",
