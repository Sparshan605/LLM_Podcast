"101:41", "he knows that's the thing yeah who knows", "101:42", "what happens if he gets dinged I think", "101:44", "he well be slower and because if it's", "101:47", "Floyd in its heyday yeah kind of insane", "101:49", "a chance but Floyd thus not slower man", "101:53", "well you remember my Donna you know my", "101:55", "Donna came in fucking winging bombs at", "101:57", "Floyd yeah and the first fight Floyd", "101:59", "Conor I think maybe either", "102:01", "underestimated him or didn't understand", "102:03", "like the like the style that he was", "102:05", "gonna be uh sent and he got clipped he", "102:08", "got clipped with one punch at the end of", "102:09", "one of the rounds where his legs wobbled", "102:11", "and I was like whoa and then remember", "102:13", "Flo did the rematch got it yeah what's", "102:16", "he downloaded it but oh yeah I think", "102:18", "Matt's made didn't take him serious it's", "102:20", "possible or it's possible Maidana", "102:23", "fought really well in the first fight", "102:25", "and didn't fight so well in the second", "102:26", "fight for various reasons you know but", "102:28", "the only thing with that is Conor so", "102:30",

"102:41", "out is very crisp", "102:42", "you know it's like you have to you have", "102:44", "to respect it like what he did to Jose", "102:46", "Aldo Slezak and drop that left hand in", "102:49",

"102:58", "truck just so much smaller than boxing", "103:00", "it's just you know it's his timing that", "103:04", "makes him special this time will be", "103:05", "better than Floyd's Boyd's gonna be a", "103:07", "little slower", "103:07", "I just think Connors timing with the", "103:09", "speed and power that's right that's why", "103:11", "I give him a shot if Floyd sleeps on him", "103:14", "at all and Connor comes in and does", "103:16", "something very unusual and catches flow", "103:19", "with the big punch early it could be", "103:20", "chaos hey how about Floyd you're crazy", "103:24", "man well here's the thing", "103:25", "MMA fighters fight with four ounce", "103:27", "gloves so like why is boxing decided", "103:31", "that eight ounces are what's safe for", "103:34",
