["00:00", "- one Kevin Ross bringer of gifts good", "00:06", "to see you brother thank you very much", "00:08", "for that bag oh you're very welcome it's", "00:09", "very cool people let you know a Kevin", "00:12", "brought our giant heavy bag filled with", "00:15", "sand that has Dawei North of 200 pounds", "00:18", "oh yeah right I think it's about 250", "00:20", "yeah a lot of fun getting that in my car", "00:24", "by myself is that your preferred method", "00:26", "for conditioning your shins for sure for", "00:28", "sure you know the thing with Qing", "00:31", "conditioning a lot of people do you know", "00:33", "they smack themselves in the shin with", "00:34", "bottles and kind of stupid things like", "00:36", "that yeah you're not really creating", "00:40", "what you need to which is a overall", "00:44", "conditioning overall strengthening of", "00:47", "the nerve the bone all you're really", "00:51", "doing is deadening little spots in your", "00:52", "nerves but that's the worst thing you", "00:55", "can do without strengthening your bones", "00:56", "you're deadening the nerves but not", "00:57", "strengthening the bone overall and if", "00:59", "you're not doing that you're gonna think", "01:02", "your bones a lot stronger than it is but", "01:04", "it can't handle the impact so with with", "01:06", "a sandbag you're you're you're covering", "01:07", "much more surface area and you know", "01:11", "applying it in a realistic situation", "01:13", "where you're able to throw kicks", "01:15", "repeatedly at this thing and what you", "01:17", "would you really want to do is do it to", "01:18", "a degree that it's causing a certain", "01:21", "amount of pain but you're able to do", "01:23", "this daily with with repetition because", "01:26", "that's how you continue to develop just", "01:28", "like getting stronger at anything you", "01:30", "know it doesn't happen overnight you got", "01:32", "to just do this every day just at the", "01:34", "end of your session knock out a few", "01:36", "kicks and then again tomorrow night and", "01:38", "again the next day and you slowly and", "01:40", "steadily are they able to go harder and", "01:42", "harder and develop this strength and", "01:46", "conditioning in your shins so the idea", "01:48", "is that you're making like these little", "01:50", "tiny micro fractures right yeah for sure", "01:52", "and yeah like I said you want to be able", "01:56", "to cover a good surface area so you're", "01:59", "hitting it all it kind of at once as", "02:01", "opposed to like little spots which is", "02:03", "what happens when you just whack it with", "02:04", "a batter or something like that my", "02:06", "experience was whacking it with a bad as", "02:08", "everybody kind of quits you're like hey", "02:10", "I'm gonna condition my shins and then", "02:12", "just go what the fuck am i doing and", "02:13", "they stopped doing it well the thing to", "02:15", "with with when you're able to kick like", "02:17", "that is you can kind of slowly build up", "02:20", "you know you start a little bit lightly", "02:22", "and develop a little bit stronger and", "02:24", "you kind of create a little bit of a", "02:26", "crease and you know as you get going you", "02:29", "your brain can kind of wrap itself", "02:32", "around it a little bit better and then", "02:33", "you still going harder and harder and by", "02:34", "the end of you know your five ten-minute", "02:36", "session you're putting some serious", "02:38", "weight into that and you're not you're", "02:40", "not noticing it as much yeah we were", "02:43", "talking about your your need that you", "02:45", "had a fracture and you need that you", "02:47", "didn't realize you had yeah that's this", "02:49", "it's we're like the thing that disturbs", "02:51", "me maybe the most in kickboxing and so", "02:54", "I've only seen it a few times is when", "02:55", "someone checks a kick and their leg", "02:57", "snaps in half you know like Tyrone Spong", "02:59", "when you fought gokon sake or Anderson", "03:01", "Silva when he fought Chris Weidman", "03:02", "anything that snap of when the the shin", "03:06", "gives out like that can you prevent that", "03:09", "from doing this obviously it's one of", "03:12", "those just freak things that happens you", "03:15", "know clearly with those guys you can", "03:17", "have the most conditioned Chin's in the", "03:18", "world but you catch them the wrong way", "03:20", "wrong time they can happen in it's rare", "03:24", "but it does happen and it doesn't really", "03:26", "matter how long you've been doing this", "03:29", "how strong your shins are sometimes", "03:31", "things just break I always wonder how", "03:33", "many guys have little breaks and they", "03:35", "don't know about it - probably a lot", "03:37", "yeah a lot yeah they said that's what", "03:39", "happened with Anderson but Anderson", "03:41", "threw a kick and he broke it before that", "03:44", "like he felt something was wrong and", "03:46", "then went through that second kick and", "03:48", "it snapped in half that's what that's", "03:49", "why I did that yeah yeah that makes", "03:51", "sense", "03:52", "well Weidman was checking it perfect he", "03:54", "was checking it right at the top of his", "03:55", "knee yeah and you know that's a big", "03:57", "thing with you know fighting a lot of a", "04:01", "lot of people tend to just blindly just", "04:05", "pick their shin up you know as opposed", "04:07", "to paying attention to where it is on", "04:09", "your shin that it's hitting just just", "04:10", "like when you're kicking you need to pay", "04:12", "attention to what piece of your leg", "04:14", "you're hitting with which piece of your", "04:16", "shin you're checking with and the higher", "04:17", "up on your shin it is that the harder", "04:19", "it's going to be and when you're", "04:21", "southpaw versus orthodoxson throwing", "04:23", "that inside leg kick you're you're", "04:25", "you're coming upwards at an angle which", "04:27", "is tends to be like low on your foot or", "04:29", "your your your ankle and then you're", "04:31", "checking with high up by your knee so", "04:33", "you have the smallest part of your shin", "04:35", "connecting with the the hardest part of", "04:37", "somebody else's and with that that's", "04:39", "just the one that tends to do that yeah", "04:42", "it's a shin on shin contact is such a", "04:46", "brutal thing like I think everybody", "04:48", "should experience it once yeah you know", "04:50", "just crack oh yeah and you know the", "04:53", "funny thing is it doesn't matter how", "04:55", "long you've you've done this for you we", "04:57", "watch these fights and assume that they", "05:00", "don't feel pain and that it doesn't", "05:01", "bother them but even guys with hundreds", "05:03", "and hundreds of fights you see in the", "05:05", "next day and their gimping around pretty", "05:06", "good yeah you know we have this idea in", "05:09", "our brains that eventually you're gonna", "05:11", "get to a point when you just don't feel", "05:12", "pain and it doesn't bother you but", "05:14", "eventually realize that never happens", "05:16", "you know it is better to get that out of", "05:18", "your head now you know Muay Thai and", "05:20", "kickboxing and anything that the bone on", "05:22", "bone is it's going to be painful and", "05:24", "that's part of the art of it you learn", "05:26", "how to place your kicks better and pay", "05:29", "attention to what you're doing and yeah", "05:30", "of course you you develop your shin", "05:33", "conditioning and that kind of thing but", "05:35", "it always hurts it's always gonna hurt", "05:37", "it's such a brutally effective way to", "05:40", "fight and it's so interesting that", "05:42", "Thailand perfected that yeah I've always", "05:45", "been fascinated by that like you know", "05:47", "you think about the entire world it's an", "05:49", "enormous world and people have been", "05:52", "fighting in this enormous world from the", "05:54", "beginning of time and this one island", "05:57", "they said hey I got an idea well it's a", "06:01", "cultural thing over there you know it's", "06:02", "part of their upbringing it's like", "06:04", "baseball over here or soccer in other", "06:07", "parts of the world where everybody kind", "06:10", "of does it to one extent or the other", "06:12", "and you know clearly if you're doing", "06:13", "this from time you're a child", "06:16", "particularly when it's a job like it is", "06:18", "for them over there and it's a it's more", "06:21", "than just for fun it's not for fun it's", "06:23", "it's like this how I survive this or", "06:25", "working in the fields you know and that", "06:29", "completely changes their mentality about", "06:31", "it and that's why when you go there it's", "06:33", "like obviously the skill for sure but", "06:35", "but the mentality and their reasons for", "06:37", "doing this like", "06:38", "it's so different it's so different yeah", "06:42", "and they start so young and there's", "06:43", "they're they're basically sent to these", "06:45", "camps and they start fighting like you", "06:49", "know before they're like 10 years old", "06:51", "yeah oftentimes yeah a lot of these kids", "06:53", "you know they're their families send", "06:55", "them to these these camps and that's", "06:57", "where they're raised you know they're", "06:59", "raised in a gym to be fighters and to", "07:02", "work for the gyms I mean that that's", "07:04", "really what they're doing is they're", "07:06", "working you know they're they're they're", "07:08", "getting money to send back to their", "07:09", "families and they're not doing this for", "07:11", "fun they're not doing yeah hobby I've", "07:14", "always been fascinated by the way the", "07:15", "tie spar as well because I think it's", "07:17", "really interesting that given that they", "07:20", "do fight so often and their livelihood", "07:23", "depends on it and that it is not a game", "07:25", "they've really figured out a bunch of", "07:27", "things and one of the things that", "07:28", "figured out is hit the pads hard hit the", "07:32", "bag hard spar light yeah yeah there's", "07:35", "there's give-and-take to everything that", "07:38", "we do and we're trying to maximize our", "07:42", "learning and minimize the damage or the", "07:45", "the risk of injury that we're taking and", "07:48", "we have the opposite approach here in", "07:51", "America oh just beat the shit out of", "07:53", "each other and you know that's good", "07:55", "that's how you're gonna get better but", "07:56", "you don't really develop when you're", "07:58", "going hard like that you're learning how", "07:59", "to be tough and you're gonna how to take", "08:01", "damage and you're you know learning how", "08:03", "to be in the fire like that which is", "08:05", "important but you're not really", "08:08", "developing you know when you when you're", "08:09", "playing when you're practicing when", "08:10", "you're not thinking about getting", "08:13", "injured or knocked out you're able to", "08:15", "learn new and apply new things and new", "08:18", "techniques and and and practice things", "08:21", "that you normally wouldn't it's like", "08:23", "when you're worried about getting hurt", "08:25", "you're only gonna focus on the things", "08:26", "that you're really good at you know", "08:28", "you're not going to try these different", "08:29", "approaches and that's what really limits", "08:32", "a lot of our development you know a lot", "08:34", "of you see a lot of fighters their their", "08:36", "ability kind of levels off at to a", "08:38", "certain degree and they don't they don't", "08:40", "continually develop as their careers go", "08:42", "on and they also don't last very long", "08:45", "either because of the amount of damage", "08:46", "their their bodies and their brains are", "08:48", "taking you know each one of us only has", "08:51", "a fine", "08:52", "number of shots to the head we can take", "08:54", "and end shots of the body we can take", "08:56", "and do you want to use those in the gym", "08:58", "or do you want to use those in the ring", "09:00", "you know I think it's really about", "09:02", "finding a good balance between that you", "09:05", "know in the beginning all I did was just", "09:06", "go crazy and spar super hard six days a", "09:09", "week leading all the way up to the fight", "09:11", "and six days a week you were sparring", "09:13", "hard really yeah yeah and with guy I", "09:15", "mean the smallest guy I had to work with", "09:17", "coming up was probably 20 pounds bigger", "09:19", "than me and you know in a lot of ways", "09:21", "this helped me develop and gain a lot of", "09:24", "strength and confidence and and ability", "09:27", "to take that kind of punishment but it", "09:30", "also did a lot of detrimental things a", "09:32", "lot of stupid injuries a lot of damage", "09:34", "and you know over the years I've come to", "09:36", "develop and get more on to the tie", "09:39", "approach of things and and practice and", "09:42", "playing and you know finding when the", "09:43", "time to go hard is and when the time to", "09:45", "to learn and develop is and what's", "09:49", "counterproductive and what isn't how do", "09:51", "you make that distinction like how do", "09:52", "you know when's the time to go hard you", "09:54", "don't you don't really I mean everything", "09:56", "that we do is a process of trial and", "09:58", "error you know and I think once you kind", "10:03", "of understand that you can think clearly", "10:07", "and and apply the things you need to in", "10:09", "the midst of that fire fight watch it", "10:11", "which you know is really what shuts a", "10:13", "lot of people down in the beginning they", "10:14", "can't process the information that's", "10:17", "happening because it's so intense and", "10:19", "and that is why it's important to kind", "10:20", "of have that in and have that fight like", "10:23", "such a waste scenario in in the gym but", "10:26", "once you've done that and you've had the", "10:28", "experience and all of that I think it's", "10:30", "it's so much so much more beneficial to", "10:32", "start going towards the other direction", "10:35", "especially if you want to stay in this", "10:37", "sport for a good amount of time and not", "10:41", "take unnecessary damage for really no", "10:44", "purpose whatsoever it should to me it", "10:47", "should be the exception and not the rule", "10:49", "you know like have those hard training", "10:52", "sessions ins once in a while especially", "10:53", "if you can get working with people that", "10:54", "you're not used to because because you", "10:56", "know obviously when you fight it's you", "10:58", "don't know what they're really doing in", "10:59", "there and it's like working with a", "11:01", "stranger and in the gym we we know each", "11:04", "other so well that we tend to", "11:05", "just work on those things in our", "11:07", "practice but but that's how we develop", "11:11", "and if we're not doing that we're really", "11:13", "limiting ourselves it's got to be", "11:15", "difficult to find the right balance in", "11:18", "terms of like what gym you're training", "11:19", "at like what were you training at these", "11:21", "days I'm down in San Diego now I moved", "11:24", "down there two years ago at the the", "11:26", "boxing club oh there's that Artem yeah", "11:29", "yeah sure ocean look Bevin's place yeah",

over this country since", "12:46", "you know moved all over the place since", "12:48", "I was a little kid and San Diego was", "12:51", "just where I always planned I'd be one", "12:53", "day I didn't think I'd move down there", "12:55", "until I was done fighting but through", "12:58", "the process of a lot of things and you", "12:59", "know transitions in my life it just kind", "13:02", "of was the right time to go it's the", "13:04", "perfect balance cuz it's like a city but", "13:07", "it's not a big city yeah and it's got a", "13:10", "lot of beauty like there's beautiful", "13:12",

"126:37", "headphones and there's one of the", "126:39", "reasons I like headphones is cuz your", "126:40", "voice is in my ear yeah you're not over", "126:43", "there you're right here man you're we're", "126:45", "locked in and this is exactly the same", "126:47", "way that other people are gonna hear it", "126:48", "which is a very unusual way to hear a", "126:50", "conversation yeah you don't think about", "126:51", "it that way but most the time when you", "126:53", "hear a conversation your voice is louder", "126:55", "because it's closer and they're over", "126:56", "there", "126:57", "yeah yeah and you're talking to each", "126:58", "other and you know maybe you check your", "127:00", "phone or maybe you're distracted by", "127:01", "other noises but when you were in",

that with the", "127:18", "headphones big yeah that's interesting", "127:20", "it keeps you from talking over each", "127:21", "other too much - because conversations", "127:24", "are improvisational right you know you", "127:26", "have a dance partner you know one step", "127:27", "on each other's toes but you do it", "127:29", "casually it's just so you get better at", "127:31", "it and it's for more than two people", "127:35", "it's mandatory like when you have three", "127:37", "or four people on a podcast you cannot", "127:39", "do it without headphones or it's just", "127:41", "talking over each other like I learned", "127:43", "that doing those fight companions oh", "127:44", "yeah cuz everyone's drunk and then they", "127:46", "have the headphones on it's sort of at", "127:48",

concentrating on it you get", "128:09", "better at it", "128:10", "yeah I'm sure yeah I think I think just", "128:13", "the understanding of it's a constant", "128:17", "balancing at it's a constant development", "128:21", "the sooner you come to terms and", "128:23", "understand that the better off you're", "128:26", "gonna be", "128:26", "but yet we get locked into these ways of", "128:30", "thinking these ways of living and so", "128:32", "your did that wait till you die and a", "128:34", "lot of people are and to constantly be", "128:37", "questioning yourself and to be searching", "128:39", "I feel like I'm a seeker I'm seeking", "128:43", "different ways to do things different", "128:45", "ways to think different perspectives on", "128:48", "situations but particularly ones that", "128:50", "might be like stuck on like this is the", "128:52", "way I think this is what I believe like", "128:53", "I want to explore what my beliefs and", "128:56", "feelings and viewpoints are on", "128:59", "everything yeah I think that is how you", "129:03", "gain a better understanding of what this", "129:07", "thing is what this thing we're", "129:08", "experiencing is you know what nobody", "129:10", "knows what the hell it is know what it", "129:12", "is yeah I just got you know there's some", "129:16", "scientists that are they they're trying", "129:20", "to they've written a book about it but", "129:22", "they're trying to come on the podcast to", "129:25", "lay out all of the reasons why this is a", "129:29", "simulation yeah and I'm going over some", "129:32", "of their work and I'm like this is", "129:33", "fucking so crazy yeah cuz if if they're", "129:36", "right like what are we doing yeah we're", "129:39", "playing a video game yeah if they're", "129:41", "right yeah and then there's the thought", "129:44", "that maybe that is what life is period", "129:47", "and that this idea of like oh one day", "129:50", "we're going to create an artificial", "129:51", "environment that we exist in that's", "129:54", "going to be indistinguishable from the", "129:55", "real world that we existed now maybe", "129:58", "it's always that yeah maybe it's been", "130:01", "that from the beginning and evolution is", "130:03", "actually a part of this long game mm-hmm", "130:05", "and that this cycling of life and life", "130:08", "and death and all these things is just a", "130:10", "part of this insane", "130:12", "long progressive game yeah yeah great", "130:17", "and lined up and I'm going to think", "130:18", "about it and you know who can say that", "130:21", "that's not the case", "130:23", "yeah no nobody nobody can no you can't", "130:26", "you can't and the more you think about", "130:28", "it you might like check out reality to a", "130:32", "degree so it's it's a scary thing I'm", "130:34", "also genuinely curious as to other", "130:36", "people's perspectives like they're", "130:38", "sometimes I you know I love reading", "130:40", "people's takes on current events takes", "130:44", "on people and takes on like movies and", "130:47", "music and all because I I've disagreed", "130:50", "with so many of them and I know like", "130:51", "what how is this person viewing the", "130:54", "world like I would like to be them for a", "130:56", "short period of time if I knew for a", "130:58", "fact I can come back and be

"completely different to you yeah this", "131:37", "white looks yellow yellow yeah we call", "131:39", "it the same right because we're we agree", "131:42", "and that's like so much of reality is", "131:44", "just something we all agree upon until", "131:47", "we don't until we change our minds but", "131:49", "there's so many people that see and feel", "131:51", "and think very different things and we", "131:53", "look at them as crazy because the", "131:55", "majority of us say that's not the way we", "131:58", "see or sure but all anything is is an", "132:01", "agreeance upon what this thing is and is", "132:06", "that is that what makes things real that", "132:09", "we agree that it's real", "132:14", "well we think about other things that", "132:15", "people have tastes for like
