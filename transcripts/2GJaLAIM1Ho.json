he", "07:54", "fell on the ground and accidentally", "07:56", "broke his hyoid bone yeah big deal I", "08:00", "mean it's so bizarre I can't stand", "08:03", "consider conspiracy theories I'm one of", "08:04", "these people who who doesn't like", "08:06", "reading but I can't I can't make this", "08:08", "story work in a way that isn't you know", "08:11", "yes pure toriel's well that's the thing", "08:13", "it's like it gets to a point where you", "08:15", "like okay even Michael Shermer who runs", "08:17", "skeptic magazine wait a minute the", "08:20", "cameras we're not working seems like a",

"sides of the aisle right this is a", "09:12", "classic is something I've written about", "09:13", "before is that the press does not like", "09:16", "to do stories where the problem is", "09:19", "bipartisan yeah right so when you have", "09:21", "an institutional problem when Democrats", "09:23", "and Republicans both share", "09:25", "responsibility for it when you know or", "09:28", "or if it's an institution that kind of", "09:30", "exists in perpetuity no matter what the", "09:31", "administration is we don't really like", "09:33", "to do those stories we like if Fox likes", "09:35", "to do stories about Democrats MSNBC", "09:38", "likes to do stories about Republicans", "09:39", "but the thing that's kind of you know", "09:42", "all over the place they don't like to do", "09:43",

"think that's this is one of the reasons", "09:53", "why this story doesn't have a lot of", "09:55", "traction in the media because neither", "09:57", "side really likes the idea of going too", "10:00", "deeply on it feels like to me well it's", "10:03", "but the the blatant aspect of it they", "10:06", "don't mean the closest that we have to", "10:08", "that is the absolute murder the Jamal", "10:11", "Khashoggi murder that's the closest", "10:13", "thing we have to or is absolute murder", "10:15", "right this one but but it's also so", "10:17", "insanely blatant but now you have", "10:19", "foreign actors that are involved in it", "10:20", "and they all disperse and then there's", "10:22", "left with this confusion of to who's", "10:24", "responsible for it well Saudi Arabia", "10:27", "that's another example where you can't", "10:29", "really say it's you know one side of the", "10:31", "both parties have been incredibly", "10:33", "complicit in their cooperation with the", "10:36", "Saudi regime and in you know the", "10:38", "massacres that are going on Yemen it's a", "10:41", "classic example of what Noam Chomsky", "10:43", "used to talk about with worthy and", "10:45", "unworthy victims right like if the", "10:47", "Soviet communists did it they were that", "10:49", "was bad but if death squads in El", "10:52", "Salvador killed a priest or a Catholic", "10:54", "priest you know then that that was", "10:56", "something we didn't write about because", "10:57", "they were our client state Yemen is a", "11:00", "story we don't write about Syria", "11:02", "is a story we do write about but they're", "11:03", "really equivalent stories and yeah the", "11:07", "but you're absolutely right the", "11:08", "khashoggi thing I don't think either",

a", "11:19", "long time but come how much are things", "11:21", "changing in the light of the Internet", "11:24", "well a lot and this is what I mean I", "11:26", "have a new book out now that's really", "11:27", "about this right what why the business", "11:29", "has changed what's it called hey dink", "11:31", "yeah it's out its out now and it's it's", "11:36", "really about how the press the business", "11:38", "model the press has changed I mean it's", "11:40", "something that you talk about a lot you", "11:41", "hear you on your show all the time", "11:43", "talking about how news agencies are", "11:46", "always trying to push narratives on", "11:48", "people trying to get people wound up and", "11:50", "upset and that is a conscious business", "11:53", "strategy that we didn't have maybe 30", "11:56", "years ago you know you think about", "11:58", "Walter Cronkite or what the news was", "12:00", "like back in the day you had the whole", "12:02", "family sitting around the table and", "12:04", "everybody watched it was sort of a", "12:06", "unifying experience to watch the news", "12:08", "hmm now you have news for the crazy", "12:11", "right-wing uncle and then you have news", "12:12", "for the kid in the che shirt and their", "12:15", "different channels and they're trying to", "12:16", "wind these these people up you know to", "12:20", "get them upset

making money they dominated", "12:31", "distribution the newspaper was the only", "12:33", "thing in town that had a you know if you", "12:35", "wanted to get a wan ad it had to be", "12:37", "through the local newspaper", "12:38", "now with the internet the internet is", "12:40", "the distribution system anybody has", "12:43", "access to it not just the local", "12:44", "newspaper and so there the easy money is", "12:48", "gone and we have to chase clicks more", "12:49", "than we ever had had to before we have", "12:52", "to chase eyeballs more than we have to", "12:53", "so we've had to build new money-making", "12:55", "strategies and and a lot of it has to do", "12:58", "with just sort of monetizing anger and", "13:00", "division and all these things and we", "13:01", "just didn't do that before and it's a", "13:03", "had a profound difference on the", "13:05", "on the media as a writer if you", "13:07", "personally experienced this sort of the", "13:10", "influence where people have tried to", "13:12", "lean you in the direction of clickbait", "13:14", "or perhaps maybe alter titles that make", "13:18", "them a little bit disingenuous in order", "13:20", "to get people excited about the I mean", "13:21", "you know I my editors at Rolling Stone", "13:24", "are pretty good in it and they give me a", "13:25", "lot of weight leeway to kind of explore", "13:27", "whatever I want to explore but I", "13:29", "definitely feel a lot of pressure that I", "13:30", "didn't feel before in the business", "13:33", "because especially in the Trump era and", "13:36", "and you know I've written a lot about", "13:37", "the Russia story right but you know", "13:39", "that's an example of one size media does", "13:43", "has one take on it and another size", "13:45", "media has another take on it and if you", "13:47", "are just the journalist and you and you", "13:49", "want to just sort of report the facts", "13:52", "you feel a lot of pressure to fit the", "13:53", "facts into a narrative that your", "13:55", "audience is gonna like and I had a lot", "13:57", "of problem with the Russia story because", "13:58", "I thought you know I don't like Donald", "14:00", "Trump but I'm like I don't I don't think", "14:02", "this guy's James Bond consorting with", "14:04", "Russian spies I think he's corrupt in", "14:07", "other ways and there was a lot of", "14:09", "blowback on my side of the business", "14:11", "because you know people in sort of", "14:15", "liberal quote-unquote liberal media you", "14:17", "just have all there's a lot of pressure", "14:18", "to have everybody fit into a certain", "14:20", "narrative and I think that's really", "14:21", "unhealthy for the business yeah", "14:23", "very unhealthy right it's you know", "14:25", "because as soon as people can be", "14:26", "manipulated to conform it to that", "14:27", "narrative then all sorts of stories can", "14:29", "be shifted oh yeah yeah absolutely and", "14:32", "and you the the job used to be about", "14:35", "challenging your audience every now and", "14:37", "then right like if you think a certain", "14:38", "thing is true well it's our job to give", "14:40", "you the bad news and say that you're", "14:41", "wrong about that that used to be what", "14:43", "the job was to be journalists now it's", "14:45", "the opposite now we have an audience", "14:48", "we're gonna tell you exactly what you", "14:49", "want to hear and what you and we're", "14:51", "gonna reinforce what you think and", "14:53", "that's very unhealthy a great example of", "14:56", "this was in the summer of 2016 I was", "15:00", "covering the campaign I started to hear", "15:03", "reporters talking about how they didn't", "15:06", "want to report poll numbers that showed",

"15:15", "we're not telling this to audiences", "15:17", "because", "15:18", "they wanted to hear that it was gonna be", "15:20", "a blowout for Hillary right on and that", "15:23", "didn't help Hillary it didn't help the", "15:25", "Democrats do not warn people about this", "15:27", "right but it was just because if you", "15:30", "turned on MSNBC or CNN and you heard", "15:33", "that Trump was within five points or", "15:35", "whatever it was that was gonna be a", "15:37", "bummer for that audience so we stayed", "15:39", "away from it and you know this is the", "15:42", "kind of thing it's it's not politically", "15:44", "beneficial to anybody it's just we're", "15:46", "just trying to keep people glued to the", "15:48", "set by telling them what they want to", "15:50", "hear and

exactly", "16:17", "what the each news organization what", "16:21", "their take is going to be on any issue", "16:23", "by going oh", "16:24", "just did you take an example when when", "16:28", "the business about the Isis leader al", "16:30", "Baghdadi", "16:31", "being killed hit the news", "16:34", "instantaneously you knew that the New", "16:36", "York Times CNN and the Washington Post",
