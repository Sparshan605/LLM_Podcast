that they ever", "113:33", "found that was completely like untouched", "113:37", "really yeah grave robbers yeah grave", "113:41", "robbers had found every other tomb", "113:43", "because they really they tubes were", "113:45", "miles away from the pyramids because I", "113:47", "mean they probably had tombs in the", "113:50", "pyramids that were raided and then they", "113:52", "realized after a while I click we got to", "113:53", "hide these things right so they took", "113:55", "them way far out miles and miles away", "113:57", "and they they put them in these like", "114:00", "hillsides and they but then thieves", "114:02", "found them there too", "114:03", "she's so so it was that one like", "114:07", "underground did they build it that way", "114:08", "or over time", "114:09", "no

see anything down there Billy well", "114:28", "yeah that's part of the film is the", "114:30", "archaeologists like looking through the", "114:32", "hole and seeing like the gold and all", "114:34", "the chip through the hole my god", "114:38", "thousands and thousands of years", "114:40", "completely untouched amazing that's", "114:43", "amazing then you take that one thing and", "114:45", "a big giant rock ball starts rolling", "114:47", "after you", "114:48", "whoa like Indiana Jones yeah that's", "114:51", "remarks if it is really interesting", "114:52", "because like they had like a glove a", "114:55", "linen glove that was 3000 years old", "114:57", "really and you're looking at this linen", "114:59", "glove and they had sandals they had the", "115:02", "sarcophagus and sandals like he had like", "115:05", "these sort of you know decorative", "115:08", "sandals so how long were they making", "115:09", "that stuff even before then if that's", "115:11", "3,000 years a year so even before that I", "115:14", "had a guy on recently dr. Robert Schoch", "115:17", "from Boston University and he's a", "115:19", "geologist and he is one of the he's one", "115:23", "of the first people to propose the idea", "115:25", "like one of the first like real scholars", "115:27", "to propose the idea that the Sphinx is", "115:29", "far far older than people think it is", "115:32", "and that it's not from 2500 BC but it's", "115:36", "from way before that perhaps maybe", "115:38", "10,000 years old than that because it", "115:40", "has water erosion all of it can only", "115:43", "have come from thousands of years of", "115:44", "rainfall yeah so it's the implication of", "115:49", "that the implication is there were well", "115:51", "his his take on it which is really", "115:54", "interesting and he really scared the", "115:56", "shit out of me and blew my mind", "115:59", "mass coronal inject ejections so", "116:02", "something from the Sun some gigantic", "116:05", "solar flare mm-hmm that created", "116:08", "unbelievable havoc on earth he was", "116:11", "talking about lightning storms that were", "116:15", "like the Lightning coming down like", "116:18", "sheets of rain in a hurricane and that", "116:21", "it like just covered parts of the earth", "116:24", "and lightning and killed everything and", "116:27", "killed off mass mmm just mass numbers of", "116:31", "human beings large mammals although it's", "116:33", "responsible for there's a there's a big", "116:35", "mass extinction that we really don't", "116:37", "understand what caused somewhere in that", "116:40", "range of around 10,000 years ago right", "116:43", "and he attributes that to this mass", "116:45", "coronal ejection and that this this huge", "116:48", "Sun this burst of energy from the Sun", "116:51", "caused these unbelievable chaotic storms", "116:55", "that killed who knows County I said so", "116:58", "is it like like a thunderstorm", "117:01", "a hundred he's like no times a million", "117:03", "he was like sheets times a million", "117:06", "sheets of lightning coming down like", "117:09", "rain in a hurricane oh my gosh Majan", "117:11", "lightning just just cooking the earth", "117:14", "for like a long period of time or just", "117:16", "like one big storm long period of time", "117:18", "like so the Sun just kept people that", "117:20", "started living in caves and they built", "117:23", "these dwellings inside the earth because", "117:25", "that way where that survived they could", "117:27", "survive where the radiation wasn't", "117:28", "coming down it wasn't going through the", "117:30", "earth to get to them so houses tents", "117:33", "anything that you lived in that was", "117:35", "outside that those those people were", "117:37", "dead the only people that live or the", "117:39", "people that lived the Heather houses", "117:40", "carved into hillsides is there evidence", "117:42", "of this yeah yeah yeah everybody's", "117:43", "geological evidence which is visit a", "117:46", "mainstream thing or is kind of wells he", "117:48", "kind of that's possible as mainstream", "117:50", "right whether or not it happened then is", "117:52", "up for debate it's also the end of the", "117:55", "Ice Age and he thinks that's the reason", "117:56", "why the all these ice caps melted and", "117:59", "this was what caused oh that was part of", "118:01", "that has a massive shift in the massive", "118:04", "shift in the the global temperature jeez", "118:07", "yeah that's crazy I was just reading a", "118:09", "thing about the Ice Age yesterday in The", "118:11", "Times that about how the ice changed", "118:14", "Manhattan all the five boroughs like", "118:17", "that's kind of where the ice kind of", "118:18", "came down to was around there and seeing", "118:20", "how receded and what it left behind", "118:22", "we were but there but the civilizations", "118:25", "weren't really living around then right", "118:28", "what do you mean during the Ice Age of", "118:29", "course there were they were well there", "118:31", "were some civilizations I mean there's", "118:33", "established civilizations like there's", "118:34", "some structures for gathering", "118:36", "well there's some structures that have", "118:38", "been absolutely linked to that time a", "118:41", "big one is gobekli tepe which is in", "118:44", "Turkey and they have they've absolutely", "118:46", "dated that to 12,000 years ago", "118:48", "so what's fascinating about that is they", "118:50", "didn't know that people were capable of", "118:51", "building these gigantic stone structures", "118:53", "12,000 years ago and they've only", "118:55", "uncovered a very small amount of Quebec", "118:57", "Lee Tepe it's a huge huge site so do you", "119:00", "think that there's still tons of stuff", "119:02", "we could discover out there that hasn't", "119:04", "been tapped yet like under the oceans or", "119:06", "yeah for sure", "119:07", "yeah well if people lined it if these", "119:09", "guys are right", "119:10", "and here's the thing they what they", "119:13", "think is", "119:14", "that there's been there was a big dip", "119:18", "and I forget what his term that he used", "119:22", "to describe it but it was the there was", "119:26", "a Dark Age that was created by these", "119:29", "mass ejections and that civilization", "119:33", "particularly in Egypt had reached a very", "119:35", "high level of sophistication when they", "119:37", "were capable of building these gigantic", "119:39", "stone structures and right they had all", "119:41", "this amazing architecture and", "119:43", "engineering or to move these huge stones", "119:46", "and then there was a big die-off and", "119:49", "that for thousands of years people", "119:52", "essentially were knocked back almost", "119:54", "down into Stone Age and then regrouped", "119:57", "and this is but this cataclysmic story", "120:00", "this story is in Noah's Ark it's in the", "120:03", "Epic of Gilgamesh which is around some", "120:05", "air which is where Iraq is like they all", "120:08", "talk about I'll talk about the floods", "120:09", "and Catalina's chaos and Brad not", "120:12", "punished everyone and everyone died this", "120:14", "is like a part of human history many", "120:17", "different versions of like right what", "120:19", "exactly happened yeah but he's pointing", "120:21", "to geological evidence which is", "120:23", "fascinating because at one point in time", "120:24", "nine around 9,000 BC the nile valley was", "120:29", "not all sand the way we see it now but", "120:32", "it was a tropical rainforest and so for", "120:35", "thousands of years before that it was", "120:36", "you know torrential downpours and rain", "120:39", "and that all this was the reason why the", "120:42", "Sphinx enclosure has these deep fissures", "120:44", "that are indicative of rainfall and", "120:47", "water erosion for thousands of years not", "120:50", "just instantaneous flooding from some", "120:52", "giant event but from thousands of years", "120:54", "of rainfall of rain is constant rain", "120:56", "yeah and so that would predate the the", "121:00", "idea is the current established timeline", "121:04", "is that the Great Sphinx was created", "121:07", "somewhere around the time that they", "121:09", "believe the great pyramids were created", "121:10", "now the Great Pyramid they've they've", "121:12", "they've done carbon dating that", "121:15", "indicates that that was somewhere around", "121:17", "2500 BC uh-huh he thinks that that was", "121:20", "built over an older site that was from", "121:23", "many many years before then he has all", "121:25", "these photos oh yes", "121:27", "our construction methods that they've", "121:28", "done where they've taken a really old", "121:30", "site from maybe many many thousands of", "121:33", "years ago right and put something over", "121:34", "that like sort of like the analyst build", "121:37", "on top yeah with the Parthenon and the", "121:39", "Acropolis right they built it over the", "121:41", "Acropolis right we're an old thing yes", "121:44", "that they don't even know where the fuck", "121:45", "you came from yeah what where that old", "121:47", "thing where it's from so the idea is", "121:50", "that this old thing in Egypt in", "121:52", "particular is a product of an old", "121:55", "civilization from many many many a", "121:57", "thousands years ago last so long ago", "121:59", "that the the distance in the gap between", "122:02", "the people who built the pyramids and", "122:04", "the people who originally built the", "122:06", "Sphinx is far greater that are greater", "122:10", "than the hour distance between us and", "122:12", "the people built the pyramids oh really", "122:13", "yeah yeah that's amazing this is how", "122:17", "fucking crazy it is it's so the thing", "122:18", "about this Cleopatra is she's closer to", "122:22", "the creation of the iPhone then she is", "122:25", "to the creation of the pyramids that's", "122:27", "the real deal that means I really", "122:29", "yes that's established Egyptologist", "122:32", "geologist this is not controversy yeah", "122:34", "yeah yeah this is just a fact", "122:35", "she then they click but they think that", "122:38", "at 2500 BC that represents only the new", "122:41", "construction in Egypt and that before", "122:43", "that if you go to 10,000 BC and before", "122:46", "there was a whole nother civilization", "122:48", "there geez that's amazing yeah it's", "122:50", "amazing and that this is when 10,000", "122:53", "plus years ago this is when these", "122:55", "cataclysmic events happen and all these", "122:56", "people died off and much of what they", "122:59", "knew back then was lost right and they", "123:01", "rebuilt what's so scary about that is", "123:05", "that it sounds like it could happen any", "123:08", "day Oh something had happened with the", "123:10", "Sun and all of a sudden we're dealing", "123:12", "with some other big solar flare comes at", "123:15", "us and we're in trouble
