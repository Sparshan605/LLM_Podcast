the curses of", "02:37", "God so God says if you obey me I'll", "02:40", "bless you and if you disobey me I'll", "02:42", "curse you so why soldiers so several", "02:45", "times in the scriptures it's this", "02:48", "connection between the sins of the", "02:50", "nation and the punishments so for", "02:54", "instance in the book of Judges it says", "02:55", "they chose new gods then was war in",

supposedly they're over", "03:56", "there fighting so that we could be safe", "03:58", "here and then you guys are out there", "04:00", "with these signs like there had to be a", "04:02", "lot of people that have like-minded", "04:04", "views in Christianity but still were", "04:06", "furiously people yeah absolutely and and", "04:09", "from our perspective we thought that", "04:12", "they were substituting their", "04:13", "righteousness for the righteousness of", "04:15", "God so they were upset that we were out", "04:17", "there giving this message that was 100%", "04:19", "biblical and our from our point of view", "04:21", "and they God calls that compassion when", "04:25", "he sends his servants with his message", "04:27", "so we thought even though they call", "04:29", "themselves Christians they're ignoring", "04:31", "these you know vast swathes of the Bible", "04:33", "that that support what we were saying", "04:35", "and how we were saying it so I mean", "04:39", "there was definitely a lot of a lot of", "04:41", "pushback from people on all sides but", "04:43", "and especially from other Christians but", "04:45", "we just thought they're not really", "04:47", "Christian because they're not like this", "04:48", "like we understand it so you guys were", "04:50", "pretty much solidified in your opinion", "04:52", "it was a consensus it was like everybody", "04:55", "thought you were doing the right thing", "04:56", "right so I mean so that when the", "04:58", "soldiers funerals when those protesting", "05:00", "it was in June of 2005 that we started", "05:03", "protesting soldier's funeral how was it", "05:04", "brought up so my grandfather had been it", "05:07", "was 2005 so the wars in Iraq and", "05:09", "Afghanistan you know he'd been you see", "05:12", "these things on the news and he was the", "05:15", "funerals like what was going on at the", "05:16", "funerals and he said these aren't", "05:17", "funerals", "05:18", "these are patriotic pep rallies and", "05:20", "they're saying all these things about", "05:22", "God Bless America well God isn't", "05:23", "blessing America God is cursing America", "05:26", "so we have to go and and give a", "05:28", "different message um so that's how it", "05:31", "came up initially but so I went to my", "05:34", "first soldiers funeral protest and then", "05:36", "the following month in July of 2005 and", "05:39", "before I went so you know every time we", "05:42", "would go to these things I was", "05:43", "protesting from the time I was five", "05:44", "years old so when you go out on the you", "05:47", "know to these protests a lot of times", "05:49", "there would be media there they have", "05:51", "people asking questions and I wasn't", "05:54", "sure how I would answer that if somebody", "05:56", "asked me why are you at this funeral I", "05:58", "didn't I wasn't sure how I would answer", "06:00", "it so like I felt very when I found out", "06:03", "I was going I thought I thought I need", "06:04", "to I need to understand this so I went", "06:07", "to my mother and she brings forth those", "06:10", "verses that I just quoted to you and", "06:11", "several others we sat down as a family", "06:13", "as we did every night you know to read", "06:17", "the Bible and to talk about world events", "06:19", "and you know the church's interpretation", "06:21", "of these events in light of their", "06:22", "understanding of the Scriptures so you", "06:24", "know she goes through and explains this", "06:26", "you know very carefully and because her", "06:29", "answers came from the Bible I was that", "06:32", "was my foundation was that the Bible is", "06:35", "the infallible Word of God and that it's", "06:38", "true no matter what any human thinks and", "06:40", "that we have a duty", "06:41", "to obey it 100% no matter no matter what", "06:44", "I think or feel otherwise I have to", "06:48", "bring my thoughts and opinions in line", "06:49", "with this so even though I had a lot of", "06:51", "trepidation at the beginning about going", "06:53", "to those funerals I very quickly", "06:55", "acclimated to it you know as you do when", "06:57", "in an environment like that where", "06:59", "everything depends on you falling into", "07:02", "line now what was it like when you first", "07:05", "did it like what was the reaction to", "07:07", "other people well you know other", "07:09", "people's reaction to you mm-hmm so that", "07:12", "very first one it was in Omaha Nebraska", "07:14", "and it was incredibly tense so there was", "07:19", "a bunch of cops", "07:20", "we always every time we would go to", "07:22", "protest somewhere we would contact the", "07:23", "police to make sure that there would be", "07:24", "a police presence was because people", "07:27", "were tempted to and did you know would", "07:30", "come after us physically and try to", "07:32", "assault us and and again this happened", "07:34", "with some regularity so from the very", "07:37", "earliest days of the protesting we you", "07:39", "know my mom and her generation had made", "07:42", "this decision to who I should say many", "07:44", "of them are lawyers so they would you", "07:46", "know write letters from you know as", "07:47", "attorneys saying we're going to be", "07:50", "coming we're going to be protesting in", "07:51", "your city people this is what we do you", "07:54", "know we hold signs on public sidewalks", "07:55", "we are not violent we so explaining what", "07:59", "approach what our protest looked like", "08:01", "and then and then saying if you want to", "08:05", "avoid you know these kind of like", "08:07", "violence that often happens would be", "08:10", "there so this first one how old are you", "08:12", "in 2005 I was 19 so you were a kid you", "08:16", "know but a grown kid and you know you're", "08:19", "with your parents and this is the first", "08:21", "time you're protesting a veteran what", "08:24", "was that experience like so I'm standing", "08:26", "across the support standing across the", "08:28", "street from the church like I said it", "08:30", "was very solemn very quiet there were", "08:32", "which is not it was not normal really", "08:34", "for protest a lot of times we would be", "08:36", "out there you know singing and chanting", "08:37", "and and making it was a big public", "08:40", "display but this was like I said", "08:43", "incredibly tense nobody was really", "08:45", "talking nobody was really moving and you", "08:49", "know the family was you know pulled up", "08:52", "in a and I think I was in a limousine", "08:54", "across the street", "08:55", "and the family got out and looked around", "08:57", "and saw us and did they know you guys", "09:00", "were going to be there beforehand mm-hmm", "09:02", "because we always would publicize that", "09:04", "we would send out news releases so they", "09:06", "were aware that we were going to be", "09:08", "there and there were a bunch of I think", "09:11", "there were Marines like in dress blues", "09:13", "standing there and they looked", "09:15", "incredibly angry and and upset but like", "09:18", "I said I was it was like it felt like at", "09:20", "any moment if something happened like", "09:22", "that the whole situation could explode", "09:24", "but again let's with the cops having the", "09:25", "cops standing there and so it was um it", "09:29", "was it was it was pretty it was really", "09:32", "tense what kind of things are they", "09:33", "saying to you guys they weren't saying", "09:34", "anything like none of this which they're", "09:36", "what I was trying to say it's really", "09:37", "unusual for protests like that we a lot", "09:40", "of times we would be exchanging you know", "09:42", "we would we would course would be", "09:44", "yelling about Bible verses and hatred of", "09:46", "God and you know they would be talking", "09:48", "about love and tolerance and how we're", "09:50", "wrong and not Christian and but at this", "09:52", "one it was it was very quiet it wasn't", "09:54", "always like it so pretty quickly", "09:55", "you know once again once we became", "09:57", "acclimated to do the protest and also", "10:01", "there a have you heard of the Patriot", "10:03", "Guard riders it was a group of", "10:05", "motorcyclists who decided to and they", "10:09", "formed like in across the country so in", "10:11", "every state there was a group of these", "10:12", "motorcyclists who when they found out we", "10:14", "were going to be protesting somewhere", "10:15", "they would go and you know rev their", "10:17", "engines so that our words and songs and", "10:20", "such wouldn't be heard by the family and", "10:23", "and they would we know hold American", "10:24", "flags and try to block you know it's", "10:27", "always it's putting a buffer between us", "10:29", "and the family and so when when that", "10:33", "started to happen it became almost like", "10:35", "a game sometimes and in hindsight I this", "10:39", "makes me cringe and and but but it", "10:44", "became like this game of trying to like", "10:46", "show that we were going to get our", "10:48", "message across no matter what any human", "10:50", "being wanted because we knew we were so", "10:52", "sure that this was what God wanted Wow", "10:56", "what made you leave a lot of things it", "11:01", "started my very first sort of conscious", "11:03", "doubts came from conversations on", "11:05", "Twitter so Wow", "11:08", "yeah something good got done through", "11:10", "Twitter yeah lots of good things I also", "11:12", "met my husband there oh there you go", "11:13", "while I was still at the church", "11:15", "oh come out it's an atheist I I don't", "11:19", "know that he would use that word to", "11:20", "describe himself I was just talking to", "11:23", "him about this and I was like when", "11:24", "people the problem with the word is when", "11:26", "people when you say atheist people think", "11:27", "jerk and like so else all so many people", "11:31", "do so many people think it's like oh you", "11:33", "sure absolutely certain that there is no", "11:35", "God and so it's it's a word that I", "11:37", "hesitate to use to describe myself - but", "11:39", "but I'm not a not a believer I wanna say", "11:42", "I'm not a believer because I I love", "11:44", "people I believe in people and that", "11:46", "there is so much hope and for people and", "11:49", "that we can I don't know anyway so so", "11:52", "conversations that you had on Twitter", "11:54", "did what do you like what what doors", "11:56", "they open in your mind right so I got on", "11:59", "Twitter and it was like an extension of", "12:01", "the picket line right so go out there", "12:03", "with these picket signs and you know", "12:05", "people would come up to us and ask us", "12:06", "questions and so it was this it was a", "12:08", "constant a constant conversation and so", "12:11", "I got on Twitter to take that you know -", "12:14", "to the Internet to reach more people and", "12:17", "so one of the first things I did when I", "12:19", "got on Twitter was to attack this Jewish", "12:21", "man named David Abbott ball who ran a", "12:23", "blog called Julius he was listed as the", "12:25", "second most influential Jew on Twitter", "12:28", "on this was number one um I actually", "12:32", "can't remember not memorably not part of", "12:35", "my story um you can check it it's the", "12:38", "jTA's list if you want to children but", "12:40", "anyway so he's listed as number two and", "12:43", "so he responded initially with you know", "12:48", "sarcasm and and hostility um", "12:51", "but pretty quickly he sort of changed", "12:53", "tactics and started instead of like", "12:55", "mocking me although he still did do that", "12:57", "some - he's asking questions about our", "12:59", "picket signs and I started asking him", "13:01", "questions about Jewish theology because", "13:03", "I I wanted to better know how to counter", "13:06", "it you know to run the scriptures I I", "13:08", "was sure that they were wrong Jews", "13:09", "killed Jesus and and they reject him as", "13:12", "the Messiah and so all of these things", "13:14", "um so um right so we're having this back", "13:19", "and forth and this goes on for about", "13:21", "during that year I actually met him", "13:23", "twice I protested him twice once so you", "13:26", "went to his functions or was he giving", "13:28", "speeches like yeah so in Long Beach", "13:31", "actually at the Jewish accessable they", "13:33", "had this Jewish cultural festival the", "13:35", "great name", "13:36", "yeah it's great he's great um so he", "13:39", "right so I he was going to be there uh", "13:41", "and you know I went and I was protesting", "13:44", "him and he came out to the picket line", "13:48", "and it was it was one of those like very", "13:49", "rowdy pickets there was a bunch of", "13:51", "counter protesters like and they were it", "13:53", "was I had enough guys dresses like the", "13:55", "Easter Bunny and Jesus and you know it", "13:58", "actually got pretty violent I was", "13:59", "actually sued got violent well yeah and", "14:01", "the cops this mayor told you we called", "14:03", "the cops like the cops were just and", "14:05", "they're watching people like actively", "14:06", "assaulting that's like hitting us and so", "14:09", "we're like walking around trying to you", "14:12", "know to not be hit because we're not", "14:14", "gonna hit back we were there like I said", "14:15", "the church is very against violence like", "14:17", "they're not going to be violent to", "14:18", "people or defend themselves just just", "14:21", "too so I was actually really glad when", "14:24", "David came out because he became like a", "14:25", "buffer between me and the rest of the", "14:27", "counter protesters because they", "14:29", "everybody could tell that he was he was", "14:30", "wearing his delicious shirt and whatever", "14:32", "anyway so so the conversation continued", "14:34", "there and then also at another protest", "14:36", "six or seven months later", "14:38", "um and then I was not long after that", "14:43", "second protest were talking again and he", "14:45", "was asking about one of our signs that", "14:47", "said death penalty for fags", "14:49", "and you know of course I'm reiterating", "14:51", "why the church believes that he was in", "14:53", "the Book of Leviticus God calls for the", "14:55", "death penalty for gay gays and and then", "14:58", "in Romans 1 in the New Testament it's", "15:01", "reiterated says they that commit such", "15:02", "things are worthy of death so and so but", "15:08", "I'm telling David these things and he", "15:09", "says um it's like yeah but didn't Jesus", "15:12", "say let he who is without sin cast the", "15:14", "first stone", "15:14", "and I said what we always said to that", "15:17", "which was we're not casting stones were", "15:20", "preaching words and he said yeah but", "15:23", "you're advocating that the government", "15:25", "cast stones and I remember you know this", "15:28", "is all through Twitter so I I see this", "15:31", "message and I kind of gassed and I was", "15:33", "like I had never connect", "15:35", "that Jesus there of course he was", "15:37", "talking about the death penalty", "15:38", "specifically about the death penalty and", "15:40", "we were advocating it and so I wasn't", "15:43", "sure how to respond but he David kept", "15:45", "kept going he said and and what about", "15:48", "this member of your church who had a", "15:49", "child out of wedlock and I said what", "15:52", "what about it like that this is another", "15:53", "point you know people it was you know", "15:55", "common knowledge people knew about this", "15:57", "and what though this interface and we", "15:59", "would say the standard of God isn't", "16:01", "sinlessness it's repentance so she", "16:05", "doesn't deserve that punishment because", "16:06", "she repented she stopped you know she", "16:08", "wasn't having premarital sex anymore and", "16:10", "she knows that it's wrong and she", "16:11", "changed her mind and she changed her", "16:13", "conduct which is what repentance is and", "16:15", "he said yeah but she would have been", "16:18", "killed if you had instituted the death", "16:20", "penalty for that sin and it was the", "16:23", "first time again that I connected that", "16:25", "if you kill somebody", "16:26", "as soon as they sinned they you lose the", "16:29", "opportunity to repent and be forgiven", "16:31", "and so again so I'm just sort of staring", "16:35", "at my phone and you know in Topeka", "16:38", "Kansas he's in Jerusalem and I really", "16:41", "quickly ended the conversation I don't", "16:43", "even remember quite how but it was just", "16:45", "sort of this like I hadn't I didn't know", "16:47", "how to handle this because like I said", "16:49", "the church is full of lawyers they're", "16:50", "very intelligent and their arguments and", "16:52", "their theology for the most part is very", "16:55", "well-constructed and super consistent", "16:57", "and so for there to be this you know", "17:00", "this this hypocrisy this contradiction I", "17:02", "didn't like my brain was felt like I was", "17:05", "exploding so I went to a couple people", "17:07", "in the church including my mother and", "17:09", "the response was feel free to stop me at", "17:12", "any time by the way I feel like I'm", "17:13", "Filipino um so she she reiterated the", "17:18", "same verses that I had told David that", "17:20", "that supported our position but she", "17:23", "didn't address the contradiction and", "17:24", "when I seemed unsatisfied with it she", "17:28", "said I was getting wrapped around an", "17:29", "axle and just sort of you know pushed it", "17:32", "aside and the response was so just to", "17:34", "shut me down and then to move on to the", "17:37", "next thing which is it's a very human", "17:39", "thing right when somebody puts something", "17:40", "in your face that that is this", "17:42", "contradiction that you're not ready to", "17:43", "deal with it that you can't

"44:56", "that way it's just it does it's", "44:58", "irrelevant it's a nice sweet loophole if", "45:01", "you just say that's God's will God knew", "45:03", "the entire time don't worry about it but", "45:05", "it's much man wrote it yeah what they", "45:06", "did him cuz God let him do it but then", "45:08", "the question is which version right", "45:09", "which is another question like I I sort", "45:11", "of instinctively avoided it it's like", "45:13", "atheist would ask this question like why", "45:15", "the King James Version yeah and you know", "45:17", "you can't really answer

who was his", "45:53", "thoughts on like the Dead Sea Scrolls", "45:54", "and things along those lines", "45:56", "just didn't address it because it just", "45:58", "didn't matter because right again it's", "46:01", "all God's Word anyway it's God's will", "46:03", "it's God's Word so it's so fascinating", "46:06", "when someone's so rigid with their", "46:09", "belief system it's like this is it and", "46:11", "this is and as long as you believe that", "46:13", "it's all God's wills like all it's God's", "46:15", "will seriously but the New Testament was", "46:17", "written by Constantine a bunch of", "46:19", "bishops and other God's will and God let", "46:22", "him do it right okay and not just let", "46:24", "him do it but caused him caused him", "46:26", "forced it had it happen yep he knows", "46:28", "what he's doing", "46:29", "yep absolutely every every word of our", "46:30", "conversation George would think that", "46:32", "this how does God allow all the you know", "46:34",

would go", "88:37", "right I mean there were obviously there", "88:39", "were rare situations where so for", "88:41", "instance like when Gabby Giffords was", "88:44", "shot in Arizona we had a couple of an", "88:47", "FBI agent actually and a guy from the", "88:49", "local police department come and say", "88:51", "like you shouldn't go in because there's", "88:53", "a nine-year-old girl who had

own puts him on his own beast", "101:45", "and takes him to an inn and gives the", "101:46", "innkeeper money to take care of him and", "101:48", "says anything that you spend more than", "101:50", "this I'm going to I'll pay you back when", "101:52", "I when I come again", "101:53", "so he's like actually practically taking", "101:55", "care of him so Jesus says and who do you", "101:58", "think which of these was neighbor to the", "102:01", "man who felt fell among thieves and he", "102:04", "said he who has mercy on him so in other", "102:07", "words what I'm saying is like we reduced", "102:09", "loving our neighbor to preaching to", "102:12", "picketing to putting words on signs and", "102:14", "going out and publishing them that's", "102:15", "what", "102:16", "we thought loving our neighbor was but", "102:18", "the one time the example that Jesus", "102:20", "gives is not preaching like they didn't", "102:23", "go like that the Samaritan didn't go and", "102:25", "say like this happened to you because", "102:26", "you're a sinner repent he went and", "102:29", "helped them right and so like where was", "102:32", "that on our picket signs where was that", "102:33", "in your practice yeah like why didn't", "102:36", "exactly exactly like why why didn't we", "102:39", "why didn't we make that an issue for", "102:42", "ourselves like a primary part of our", "102:45", "theology and why didn't we encourage", "102:47", "others to do it too anyway so again this", "102:50", "is something that I didn't realize until", "102:51", "after I was talking to a couple of", "102:53", "Christian friends of mine who who", "102:56", "pointed that out and I was like I cannot", "102:57", "believe I missed that like all those", "102:59", "years like what and what's crazy is like", "103:01", "the in the story the priest and the", "103:03", "Levite are the people who are like", "103:04", "dealing with the things of God right so", "103:07", "they're presumably preaching it's not", "103:09", "enough like that's not actually that's", "103:11", "not the fulfillment of that yeah so", "103:13", "anyway there's like so many of these", "103:16", "things that I just couldn't see when I", "103:18", "was at the church because again you're", "103:19", "you're in this it's it's kind of an echo", "103:22", "chamber like clearly we had access to", "103:24", "the outside world and we're having these", "103:25", "discussions but the problem with that", "103:27", "discussion is that in a lot of cases", "103:29", "people just didn't understand what our", "103:31", "theology actually was how we actually", "103:33", "thought which is why you know David", "103:36", "Abbott ball making this you know Jewish", "103:38", "as like the fact that this was an", "103:40", "ongoing conversation that he really got", "103:42", "into the nuances of our theology and", "103:43", "could really understand where I was", "103:45", "coming from to be able to make the point", "103:47", "in a way that I could understand and", "103:48", "that's I mean I'm kind of in a position", "103:51", "to do that with my family now anybody", "103:53", "any of us who leaves and who understands", "103:55", "you know ken can try to push back in a", "103:57", "way that's a lot more effective than", "103:59", "people who just don't understand where", "104:01", "they're coming from so you get this job", "104:04", "yes I got a dead one my sister and I got", "104:07", "a dead one and we were only gonna be", "104:09", "there for a month and and then we're", "104:12", "gonna go back and grace was gonna go to", "104:13", "school and I was gonna get a job and", "104:15", "then I was in Deadwood for a couple of", "104:17", "weeks and I was like I could I the idea", "104:19", "of going back to Kansas and like being", "104:22", "back in the shadow of the church and", "104:24", "like seeing our family all the time and", "104:25", "like seeing them and not like it's it's", "104:28", "constantly being faced if", "104:30", "faced with rejection were the people", "104:32", "that we love the most and like the idea", "104:35", "of going back to that environment like", "104:37", "my cousin was wonderful and I love her", "104:39", "dearly like I just couldn't go back", "104:40", "there", "104:41", "so like the day before we're supposed to", "104:43", "leave Deadwood grace decided to try out", "104:46", "for a play there and and agreed to stay", "104:50", "with me so he changed like all of her", "104:51", "classes to be online and anyway so we're", "104:53", "and we're staying with jehovah's", "104:54", "witnesses which we didn't know that when", "104:57", "we booked it it was an urban be my first", "104:59", "or first air B&B it's like beautiful old", "105:00", "house in the Black Hills and um so yeah", "105:04", "like we thought at first when they", "105:06", "realized like what was happening like", "105:08", "who we were we started having these", "105:10", "conversations and then we find out", "105:11", "they're Jehovah's Witnesses and they", "105:12", "thought at first that we might be", "105:13", "disfellowshipped witnesses before they", "105:15", "realized that was we were at the church", "105:17", "anyway so it was just like this is", "105:19", "insane conversations about um you know", "105:21", "doctrine and theology and interpretation", "105:23", "and it was just so mind-blowing to see", "105:25", "that there were other ways of", "105:26", "understanding these texts that are", "105:28", "consistent with the text but totally", "105:30", "different than we understood anyway the", "105:33", "husband Dustin is Co owns a marketing", "105:36", "company in Deadwood so I took a job", "105:37", "there part-time Wow so what is your", "105:40", "process or what's the journey from", "105:43", "leaving the church going to Deadwood and", "105:46", "then becoming sort of a self-proclaimed", "105:49", "atheist like how do you how do you", "105:53", "completely remove yourself from the", "105:55", "shackles of ideology or did you know so", "105:59", "it's mm-hmm it's um it's definitely a I", "106:02", "didn't want to do I don't think it's", "106:04", "possible it's not like a switch flips", "106:06", "you're just everything that you knew is", "106:08", "gone you're obviously very rational yeah", "106:11", "so it was like each each time we'd be", "106:14", "presented with a situation that that so", "106:16", "like gay people or Jewish people or", "106:19", "these like Jehovah's Witnesses it was", "106:21", "obviously I had the instinctive", "106:23", "responses to their ideas and so but each", "106:27", "time I would feel you know feel", "106:29", "something it would the I would just like", "106:32", "ask myself these questions you know what", "106:35", "am I feeling why am I feeling it is this", "106:37", "just instinctive what is the evidence", "106:39", "like does what make sense like it's sort", "106:41", "of like having two", "106:42", "it should - to try to reconstruct like", "106:45", "actually look at the evidence again like", "106:47", "starting from scratch basically in a lot", "106:49", "of ways so so each time we're presented", "106:53", "with these situations like you know it's", "106:55", "because obviously there's all these like", "106:57", "so for instance gay people like that", "107:00", "actually didn't take that long to change", "107:02", "like because I I had met a lot of gay", "107:06", "people like well I was at the church and", "107:07", "and they after we left and you know", "107:11", "we're talking to them and I'm like you", "107:12", "know I I thought I was doing the right", "107:14", "thing and and and I'm sorry like I", "107:19", "didn't I didn't intend to hurt to hurt", "107:22", "you or to say hurtful things about you", "107:24", "like I thought I thought it was the", "107:25", "truth and now I don't know what the", "107:26", "truth is I don't know I don't know what", "107:28", "I believe I don't know I don't know what", "107:31", "I'm doing and like people I mean they", "107:35", "responded to that I mean like they were", "107:37", "really understanding and empathetic in a", "107:40", "way that I never imagined people would", "107:42", "be like given how I know if you've seen", "107:44", "like I guess it's really hard for me", "107:46", "still to to go back and watch some of", "107:48", "those videos because it's so it's I know", "107:50", "exactly where I was coming from at the", "107:53", "time but it's so like the arrogance and", "107:56", "the condescension and the certainty that", "107:58", "we were right and now of course knowing", "108:00", "like all the reasons why I don't believe", "108:03", "those things it's very strange strange I", "108:04", "Namek but anyway it's like the fact that", "108:06", "people were understanding in spite of", "108:09", "that long history of all those things", "108:11", "that I had said and done at the church", "108:13", "um was was was overwhelming and and and", "108:17", "wonderful um but anyway so like being I", "108:21", "was basically my sister and I were", "108:22", "basically putting ourselves over and", "108:24", "over um we were hadn't been in Deadwood", "108:26", "for very long when I got a message from", "108:29", "David it was on my on my birthday", "108:32", "and I I told him that we had left and", "108:35", "you know he he saw I'd stopped tweeting", "108:39", "but he knew something was up cuz I'd", "108:40", "stop tweeting several months earlier and", "108:43", "so he invited us to come to the", "108:45", "delicious festival which was a few weeks", "108:47", "later it's like the end of February or", "108:49", "something beginning of March and I had", "108:52", "protests at the delicious festival like", "108:54", "three years earlier and all the", "108:56", "like negative associations and feelings", "108:58", "about Jewish people but realizing I", "109:00", "don't know anything about Jewish people", "109:01", "like we've been protesting the synagogue", "109:03", "in in Topeka like all my life but I", "109:06", "haven't I don't really know what like", "109:08", "other than you know just generally Jews", "109:10", "killed Jesus and reject him as the", "109:12", "savior so therefore they're like without", "109:14", "hope but I didn't know really much about", "109:17", "Jewish theology I didn't know anything", "109:19", "about Jewish people like I'd never", "109:20", "really spent time with them so so I", "109:22", "wanted to go to the festival my sister", "109:24", "and I did because we wanted to we wanted", "109:27", "to meet Jewish people and like do this", "109:29", "whole it's this examining process like", "109:31", "what do we believe in why and what and", "109:33", "and we got so much like light and sort", "109:36", "of wisdom from other people like", "109:38", "learning what they believed and why you", "109:41", "know so and then David said yeah but you", "109:44", "have to you have to speak at the", "109:47", "festival and I was like no no this is", "109:52", "not happening like I can't I cannot", "109:54", "imagine facing these people that I have", "109:56", "spent so many years like I thought I", "109:57", "just it just seemed impossible and it", "109:59", "terrified me to be coming face to face", "110:01", "with people and and I hadn't even been", "110:04", "out of the church the three months yet", "110:05", "so it was it was really scary um but my", "110:08", "sister was like we're going like she she", "110:11", "knew that we needed to have this", "110:14", "experience of love like of learning", "110:17", "about Jewish people and if the cost was", "110:21", "we have to talk about it fine and she", "110:22", "don't also said later she knew I would", "110:23", "do most of the talking so like okay fine", "110:26", "but so we went and we we spoke there and", "110:29", "then I thought okay that's great now", "110:31", "we're gonna like we need to figure out", "110:32", "like grace and I kept saying we want to", "110:35", "do good like that that had been the", "110:38", "motivating principle of our life was to", "110:40", "do good and now we realize we did so", "110:42", "much damage and and so anyway so we were", "110:47", "trying to find a way like we didn't know", "110:48", "what to do like how do you move forward", "110:50", "from there and so we just we didn't know", "110:53", "so we were kind of drifting that whole", "110:56", "first year we we basically I think a", "110:58", "month was the longest we spent anywhere", "110:59", "we were you know went to visit ex", "111:03", "members of the church you know who were",

come", "111:13", "visit for a few hours sometimes or maybe", "111:15", "they're allowed to visit even though", "111:16", "they're for a while but then several", "111:19", "years before we left they cut off all", "111:20", "contact with his family there also it", "111:22", "had been very limited already but then", "111:25", "so you haven't spoken to your dad either", "111:26", "mm-hmm", "111:27", "so you spoke to his family yeah his", "111:30", "parents and his his brother how they", "111:32", "feel about all this my my grandmother I", "111:35", "called her um about a month little of",

"and how painful that that must be like", "112:27", "I've only been it's been four and a half", "112:28", "years since I left and what am I going", "112:31", "to be doing and in 30 years like how am", "112:33", "I what is what is the and I don't know", "112:35", "it's a crazy journey you've been on for", "112:37", "just four and a half years it's really", "112:40", "insane really like when did it solidify", "112:46", "in your head that you were gonna like", "112:48", "identify or like speak out as a", "112:51", "non-believer this morning I don't mean", "112:56", "like so I was I was actually talking to", "112:58", "the same about this a few months ago", "113:00", "like because like there's there's", "113:02", "there's part of me that like I mean when", "113:04", "I said when a lot of a lot of people", "113:06", "hear jerk when they hear atheist right", "113:08", "and I don't use that word for myself", "113:11", "atheist I don't either and and and this", "113:14", "because like it entails like it seems to", "113:16", "bring in like this idea that you're so", "113:18", "certain you're certain there's no God", "113:20", "you mock people who are religious you", "113:21", "don't like them in all this", "113:23", "and I don't feel that like and I also", "113:25", "feel like I am I'm open to evidence you", "113:30", "know like I haven't like decided there", "113:32", "is no God it's like I just I just don't", "113:34", "see the evidence and so I I don't", "113:36", "believe and if there is evidence like I", "113:40", "want to know like I and again I talk to", "113:42", "religious people all the time and I", "113:43", "think about theology a lot I just I", "113:44", "can't not like it also becomes there's a", "113:46", "there's a group mentality involved in", "113:49", "atheism and there's one of the reasons", "113:52", "why I was reluctant to identify as an", "113:54", "atheist is that so many people were", "113:56", "asking me to identify as an atheist like", "113:58", "would you give a shit why do you want me", "114:00", "to come out I told you I'm not religious", "114:01", "like but especially especially the idea", "114:08", "that there cannot be a God like or there", "114:12", "cannot be any sort of a higher power and", "114:14", "that after you die it just ends how do", "114:18", "you know right exactly and that's", "114:19", "exactly where I am it's not a knowing", "114:21", "for certain that there is no God it's a", "114:24", "I just don't believe there's so little", "114:26", "we know about human life yeah forget", "114:28", "about the idea of possibility of", "114:30", "afterlife or the possibility of what", "114:32", "consciousness is there possibility of", "114:33", "what this concept that we call a soul is", "114:36", "what it what is that or forget about", "114:38", "psychedelic experiences and what do they", "114:40", "represent and what what what do they", "114:42", "represent when they're coming from what", "114:44", "essentially is human neural chemistry", "114:46", "there's the most potent ones are", "114:49", "chemicals that exist in the brain", "114:50", "they're endogenous in the human body and", "114:52", "what what are those experiences and how", "114:54", "why are they so akin to religious", "114:57", "experiences and why why do people even", "114:59", "believe now especially these scholars in", "115:01", "Jerusalem have connected the burning", "115:04", "bush of Moses with the acacia bush which", "115:08", "is a bush that's rich in psychedelic", "115:10", "chemicals and they think that it's", "115:11", "entirely possible that Moses had a", "115:13", "psychedelic experience in which he came", "115:15", "back with all the laws that human beings", "115:18", "are supposed to be living as proclaimed", "115:21", "by the Great Spirit of the universe or", "115:23", "whatever the hell he encountered like", "115:25", "who who knows who knows but this idea", "115:27", "that people love to say you know God is", "115:30", "dead there is no God like that's just as", "115:33", "silly as saying there is one right and", "115:35", "this is why like the", "115:37", "like the whole process since we left", "115:38", "like it wasn't uh like I mean first of", "115:41", "all like the idea of choosing another", "115:43", "belief system like I would like learn", "115:45", "all this stuff about Jehovah's Witnesses", "115:46", "know like like okay yeah that's mostly", "115:48", "internally consistent like I think", "115:50", "there's a lot of I I never was like", "115:52", "tempted to join them or whatever and I", "115:53", "should say actually they're not they're", "115:55", "not witnesses anymore like they're not", "115:57", "if since the other left ik a little over", "115:59",

tours", "120:20", "are doing right things like that like", "120:22", "it's it's uh do you think your kids or", "120:26", "your your brothers and sisters are gonna", "120:28", "hear this I think some of them", "120:30", "definitely might definitely might do you", "120:33", "have hope that they'll eventually bolt I", "120:37", "I do I hope that they not not because of", "120:41", "any I hope they can hear the reasoning", "120:45", "and see see the consequences of what", "120:48", "they're doing for other people and that", "120:49", "a lot of it I mean is unscriptural and", "120:52", "so even even by their own understanding", "120:55", "like they there there are things that", "120:57", "contradict them I hope that they change", "121:00", "their minds at the very least I hope", "121:02", "that the church continues to to moderate", "121:04", "to not be so a lot of their new signs", "121:08", "are things like another one of the big", "121:11", "things for me was impact or II prayer", "121:13", "right which is this idea of this word", "121:15", "imprecatory it's like racket ory mm-hmm", "121:18", "so the word praying for curses for your", "121:21", "enemies right Oh God", "121:23", "right so we did this pray to curse", "121:25", "against your enemies Oh often yeah wow", "121:28", "that seems incredibly non-christian", "121:31", "right but there's a like David King", "121:33", "David oh yeah so use Old Testament", "121:36", "though right it is that's true we'll see", "121:39", "this is the thing so like you know we", "121:40", "Suisse took that as an example for us so", "121:42", "he prayed for his enemies for their", "121:43", "children to be fatherless and for their", "121:45", "wives to be widows and so he's right", "121:47", "know praying for God to do all these you", "121:49", "know bad things to it is that the Romans", "121:51", "he was praying against the Romans no is", "121:53", "it David uh Philistines okay um and Saul", "121:58", "I guess but um but so this is an example", "122:02", "right pray against his enemies so after", "122:05", "we left I sent is contacted my uses my", "122:09", "dad and talked about this problem so", "122:13", "like David also had a lot of wives but", "122:16", "we don't take his example", "122:17", "as that men should have many wise and", "122:19", "what about that and why it was because", "122:21", "it contradicts what Jesus and the", "122:23", "Apostle Paul said about marriage right", "122:25", "one man one woman for life right so he's", "122:28", "a new way", "122:29", "right so and Jesus and Paul both also", "122:32", "said they talked about loving your", "122:34", "enemies bless them that curse you and", "122:36", "pray for them that despitefully use you", "122:38", "and persecute you so you're supposed to", "122:40", "be praying for the good of your enemies", "122:43", "right and so it's a contradiction right", "122:47", "and so anyway it's another like a long", "122:51", "time like there's been like a bunch of", "122:53", "sermons like so now my grandfather", "122:54", "passed away three years ago", "122:57", "and so now there's eight elders and", "122:59", "there are the eight pastors and my dad", "123:01", "is one of them so there's been a series", "123:02", "of sermons on imprecatory prayer since", "123:05", "then and they're like it seems like it", "123:08", "seems so confused because like on the", "123:11", "one hand they're still kind of", "123:13", "justifying it but also it just seems", "123:14", "like you're trying to reconcile things", "123:16", "that aren't reconcilable right so so but", "123:20", "a lot of the then so they stopped I", "123:22", "should say there used to be a flyer that", "123:24", "went out every like Friday and that used", "123:27", "to say like thank God for 15 dead", "123:29", "soldiers we pray for 15,000 more and so", "123:32", "it would list all the soldiers who had", "123:34", "died that that week and with enough like", "123:38", "after like eight months you know my dad", "123:40", "gave a sermon about imprecatory prayer", "123:42", "like at the time when I first you know", "123:43", "said that you know there was he put out", "123:46", "of video news explaining like why", "123:49", "imprecatory prayer is the thing and it's", "123:51", "supported by the Bible", "123:52", "eight months past he gives a sermon", "123:53", "about loving your enemies within a", "123:56", "couple weeks that flyer was changed and", "123:59", "now it doesn't say that we pray for", "124:00", "15,000 more I haven't seen that what's", "124:03", "the first part is the first part still", "124:05", "thank God so they say because God is", "124:07", "sovereign you have to thank him for", "124:08", "everything so the fact that these are", "124:10", "still thank God for 15 Dead Souls yeah", "124:12", "so the second part what I'm just trying", "124:13", "to say is like there there has been some", "124:15", "moderation mm-hmm and a lot of the new", "124:18", "signs are things like be reconciled to", "124:21", "God and Christ our hope things like that", "124:24", "like that are not God hates fags like", "124:27", "those are I think that's I think that's", "124:29", "improvement at the very least even", "124:30", "though there are", "124:31", "obviously these these harsh things as", "124:34", "well so there's some adjustment and some", "124:37", "consideration", "124:38", "um so you don't talk to your dad anymore", "124:41", "either right no one no um is that Wow", "124:47", "is there anything that you think that", "124:52", "you can do other than continuing to", "124:54", "speak and continuing to to do what", "124:58", "you're doing that's going to reach them", "125:00", "so I mean I I'm almost finished writing", "125:03", "a book I'm nearing that is it a book to", "125:05", "them it's it is both for them and also", "125:09", "for for other people there's part of", "125:13", "this it's kind of what I was getting at", "125:14", "yeah it's like you're writing a book", "125:15", "like letters to my mom and dad so it's", "125:18", "not it's not it's not written quite that", "125:19", "way", "125:20", "not as I actually did consider doing it", "125:23", "that way but eventually ended up like", "125:26", "right now it's based on each chapters", "125:28", "based on a relationship that sort of", "125:30", "brings us like the starts with my mother", "125:32", "and then my grandfather and sort of like", "125:34", "coming into this ideology and then the", "125:36", "process of all the like the mental", "125:39", "machination zuv leaving and like how my", "125:41", "mind changed over time and then what's", "125:43", "happened since we left like and I hope", "125:46", "that by you know for my family I hope", "125:48", "that by articulating these things in in", "125:51", "a way it's like obviously we're sitting", "125:53", "here in even if we talked for like", "125:54", "however many hours like there's only so", "125:56", "much that it's not the same as having it", "125:58", "written in a way that's hopefully very", "126:01", "clear and and and and just honest to the", "126:06", "experience like in as much detail and", "126:08", "and clarity with as much detail and", "126:10", "cleared as possible like I think that", "126:11", "that's I hope that that will will be", "126:14", "effective and at least showing them that", "126:17", "there's a different way there are other", "126:18", "ways of of understanding these things", "126:20", "and so I do hope that um", "126:24", "I guess I also hope like in my TED talk", "126:27", "I I have I have I feel really like", "126:34", "hesitant about like trying to teach", "126:37", "anybody anything at this point you know", "126:39", "what I mean like because I spent my", "126:42", "whole life telling other people how to", "126:43", "live", "126:44", "and now to be like well you guys know I", "126:47", "got this like now I got this like you", "126:50", "know like it's just the idea of like", "126:53", "insinuating even in any way that I have", "126:56", "something to tell people about anything", "126:58", "like I I'm I really don't like that idea", "127:00", "at all and the only reason I did the Jon", "127:02", "Ronson actually is the one who reached", "127:04", "out to me about about doing X he it was", "127:05", "a thing that he was curating an event", "127:07", "that he was curating curating and and so", "127:11", "I wrote the first draft of the talk and", "127:13", "and the curators you know came back", "127:15", "after it was like well it's like this is", "127:18", "how can we avoid the mistakes that you", "127:20", "made and so like I went back and like", "127:23", "took examples from David and my husband", "127:25", "the way that people on Twitter engaged", "127:27", "me that actually helped helps change", "127:29", "things but so so it's not explicit in", "127:33", "that way in the book but I hope that", "127:35", "just by talking about this and telling", "127:37", "the stories like I when I read accounts", "127:40", "of people who have gone through similar", "127:42", "situations it it's so helpful to me like", "127:46", "to realize like my family like yes they", "127:49", "man up their their activities are kind", "127:51", "of their extreme and like they manifest", "127:54", "themselves in very strange ways to most", "127:55", "people but they're very common very", "127:57", "human flaws and if if anything that if I", "128:02", "talk about this in a way that helps", "128:04", "other people see it in their own lives", "128:05", "or that you know will resonate with", "128:07", "people who have gone through similar", "128:08", "things like that's I think that's I want", "128:12", "to do that I want to do as much good", "128:15", "with these experiences as I can because", "128:17", "just because I that's how my parents", "128:19", "raised me honestly right but their", "128:22", "argument of course would be you know you", "128:23", "were so right and so convinced when you", "128:28", "were with the church now you're so right", "128:31", "and so convinced now that you're outside", "128:32", "the church how do you know you're right", "128:34", "now so the latter it's not the same it's", "128:36", "not the same at all like I'm not I do", "128:38", "not walk through the world with the", "128:40", "sense of with that sense of certainty", "128:42", "and and in my position and righteousness", "128:45", "of my position I am asking questions and", "128:49", "I'm I'm trying to explain what why I", "128:53", "believe differently now than I did I'm", "128:55", "still asking the questions that like I", "128:57", "never stopped", "128:58", "like you know what I mean it's it's such", "129:01", "a fundamentally different way of of", "129:03", "engaging the world I do know what you", "129:05", "mean but if I was on their side and I", "129:07", "was trying to pick holes in your", "129:08", "statement which is what they seemed to", "129:09", "do right if they're listening to the", "129:11", "things you say they're listening to", "129:13", "things you say so they can counter them", "129:14", "with some sort of a Bible quote or some", "129:17", "sort of a more articulate opinion right", "129:19", "if I was listening I would say you were", "129:21", "so convinced when you with us now you're", "129:23", "so convinced but now you don't even have", "129:25", "God yes how could you be right so the", "129:28", "thing is you're deluded the Satan's", "129:30", "serpent scales are covering your eyes so", "129:32", "this actually thought yeah this is", "129:35", "another another one of the paradoxes", "129:37", "that I realized before I left so there's", "129:39", "this verse and again this is one that my", "129:41", "mom Mike would quote all the time", "129:43", "growing up and with such urgency like", "129:46", "she needed us to understand this and and", "129:48", "the verses the heart is deceitful above", "129:51", "all things and desperately wicked and", "129:53", "who can know it", "129:54", "right so so I thought the heart was good", "129:58", "home is what the heart is no I thought I", "130:01", "thought heart is like people being sweet", "130:03", "and so the human heart is inherently and", "130:06", "according to the church is inherently", "130:07", "deceitful right oh okay", "130:09", "but the problem is they also talk about", "130:12", "the heart as being like that's how we", "130:14", "know that the Bible is true has", "130:16", "forgotten God puts an unction on our", "130:18", "hearts it deceives a little heart yes", "130:20", "exactly so you're at the end of the day", "130:23", "it's always our own hearts like it's our", "130:26", "hearts that say okay well I'm going to", "130:28", "follow the Bible no matter no matter", "130:30", "what or in other words at the end of the", "130:32", "day each one of us is always making a", "130:34", "decision it's just that for them they", "130:37", "they think that outsourcing it and", "130:39", "saying that oh no it's the Bible it's", "130:41", "like well you're the it's your I tried", "130:43", "to articulate son son when I did Sam's", "130:45", "same harris-stowe a couple years ago", "130:47", "like but it's that I read it actually in", "130:49", "his book like that's what helps me like", "130:51", "it's it's your own moral impulses that", "130:53", "are authenticating the truth of the", "130:56", "Bible right so at the end of the day", "130:58", "it's still you it's still your judgment", "131:01", "your the judgment of your own deceitful", "131:04", "heart so again from their perspective so", "131:08", "I guess what I'm saying now it's like", "131:09", "I'm not when I", "131:11", "when I talk to my family when I'm", "131:13", "addressing them like it's it's with", "131:14", "these questions like I know how you", "131:17",

"131:26", "these verses like how do you do this", "131:28", "right you understand this", "131:29", "and what about verses that contradict", "131:31", "other verses in the Bible that's the", "131:34", "church doesn't believe in that that is", "131:36", "that those contradictions exist so when", "131:37", "you talk about those contradictions", "131:39", "which are pretty clear what what do they", "131:42", "say well so the Lord works in mysterious", "131:45", "ways", "131:46", "tonight kids right there's there's", "131:49", "always that like if you think there's", "131:51", "for instance like
