something", "75:47", "deep in your brain that wants to know", "75:50", "and connect with Dinosaurs when you're", "75:52", "like four or five years old because it's", "75:55", "such a fucking wild Hail

moles", "76:32", "for hundreds of millions of years we", "76:35", "were these weird fucking creatures and", "76:37", "then from 65 million years ago that mole", "76:41", "evolved into a human being according to", "76:44", "these fucking scientists all their fancy", "76:47", "they have any $65,000 a year that you", "76:51", "have to pay for education yeah this book", "76:54", "I was just listening to", "76:54", "music and the brain talked about the", "76:56", "first instrument found is this I think", "76:59", "it was like a rib flute of like an", "77:01", "elephant or something that's like 50,000", "77:04", "years old but because it's a flute they", "77:06", "go that's probably most likely not the", "77:08", "first instrument being used because it", "77:10", "was probably drums you can get into a", "77:12", "flute that's making sounds it's a big", "77:14", "evolution yeah like how how farther back", "77:17", "do you think they were just using drums", "77:19", "before they had

Yoona", "77:28", "Kate yeah like what is the accepted", "77:31", "timeline for the invention of language", "77:33", "let's say you guess I don't know what it", "77:35", "is but let's say guess I want to say", "77:39", "language that was invented a hundred", "77:41", "thousand years ago what do you think is", "77:45", "that well then I'm gonna say it's 40 I'm", "77:47", "gonna say languages it was invented", "77:49", "40,000 years ago it was Homo Sapien", "77:51", "right is that yes first but homo sapien", "77:53", "didn't always have language right homo", "77:56", "sapien I think is 250,000 plus years old", "77:59", "there's like the argument from like 250", "78:01", "tickets shaky to like 350 400 whatever", "78:04", "there whatever it could be but they", "78:05", "think somewhere around there and the", "78:07", "other thing is like they intersected", "78:10", "with was it Neanderthal man that came", "78:12", "before him and originally they just", "78:14", "thought that one ended and the next one", "78:15", "started yeah but then in fact they", "78:17", "actually existed together yup for a long", "78:20", "time and they fought yep and they fucked", "78:23", "and Neanderthal was around way longer", "78:25", "the Ender thought survived for half a", "78:27", "million years so Neanderthal was alive", "78:30", "way longer than humans have been alive", "78:32", "then modern homo sapien", "78:34", "yeah what's up everything I keep finding", "78:38", "just says like it starts with ancient", "78:39", "Egypt", "78:40", "night that can't be that's probably a", "78:43", "written language spoken language at the", "78:46", "origin date of spoken language when", "78:48", "Neanderthal was bigger and stronger but", "78:52", "homo sapien", "78:53", "they organized yeah well they work with", "78:57", "life why what really happened cuz", "79:00", "Neanderthals actually have bigger brains", "79:01", "oh really", "79:03", "yeah but they're also built way better", "79:04", "wait wait different so it might have", "79:06", "been their bigger brains was too", "79:08", "oh they're much stronger body mmm", "79:10", "because they were like 5-7 250 pounds", "79:13", "and shit 20 pounds yeah they were built", "79:15", "there from the nose huh yeah they were", "79:16", "thick ass bones man like a 5-7 200-pound", "79:20", "man today like man that guy's got to be", "79:22", "lifting some weights basically my height", "79:24", "I'm 5/8 I weight 200 pounds so I'm built", "79:27", "like a Neanderthal like legitimately yes", "79:30", "they were all built like yeah that and", "79:32", "thicker right but with way denser bones", "79:35", "and bigger heads bigger heads bigger", "79:37", "arms bigger bones the bones in the", "79:39", "forearm the arms the legs everything was", "79:41", "thicker they were just more sturdy than", "79:43", "us they're like naturally like they", "79:45", "don't have to lift weights it would rip", "79:47", "your fucking arms off they were just", "79:48", "built like almost like a half a chimp", "79:50", "like on the way from being you know", "79:53", "Australia or you know Homo erectus or", "79:56", "Australia Pittacus or any of those early",

they", "80:07", "found out about I think they're called", "80:08", "Denisovans there's those little Hobbit", "80:11", "people that we're in Australia Flores", "80:14", "for us they think there might be ones in", "80:17", "those places too even in Vietnam they", "80:19", "have one they call the orange pen deck I", "80:22", "think that's how you say it and that", "80:24", "they that's a like a little monkey man", "80:26", "like a little hairy man that lives in", "80:29", "the forest out there and before this", "80:31", "Hobbit discovery which was only like a", "80:34", "decade ago though

and you know and they", "80:44", "organized they lived in these places and", "80:46", "they use fire like that so it doesn't", "80:48", "really know shit yeah and they just", "80:50", "found that out within the last decade or", "80:53", "so so I mean how many of them were out", "80:56", "there how many other ones were out there", "80:57", "that we just don't have fossils up and", "80:59", "when you talk to a guy like Graham", "81:00", "Hancock who has that amazing book right", "81:02", "there called America before fuck that's", "81:04", "a good book I can't find even evidence", "81:06",

that to support that how would you", "81:25", "that's the problem is to when they", "81:28", "developed the larynx the voice box I", "81:31", "think they they trace it to that you", "81:33", "know that's the problem with history", "81:35", "right it's like who knows what the fuck", "81:39", "Lincoln said all we know is what Lincoln", "81:41", "wrote okay when you have Lincoln holding", "81:43",

back then for warmth", "82:03", "because you know you lived in a place", "82:06", "that was made out of wood that you", "82:08", "chopped down your fucking self should", "82:10", "have been for four years oh listen I", "82:11", "scold for four years in a row", "82:13", "I'd be tough to share a bed with Lincoln", "82:15", "he was fucking huge yeah he's all strong", "82:18", "too it's a wrestler

"82:29", "hip hop array so maybe hey it might be", "82:33", "both me no we have to you know think", "82:36", "about it in context right I think if you", "82:39", "go back to the Greeks and the Romans gay", "82:42", "sex was way more common I mean it was", "82:45", "like almost like everybody was half gay", "82:47", "right see Hannah and pedophilia was just", "82:53", "a normal thing young boys like if you", "82:56", "read Socrates you read the history of", "83:00", "him or of a lot of scholars and like", "83:03", "really respected thinkers they had young", "83:05", "boys mm-hmm but they would bang so what", "83:08", "was what today is a horrific crime", "83:12", "against humanity was completely normal", "83:16", "back then yeah so when did that stop", "83:18", "when did do is to stop banging dudes and", "83:21", "did they just kind of do it and not talk", "83:23", "about it or was it it seems like", "83:26", "Christianity first brought about the", "83:29", "shame the sexual shame

society's", "83:45", "expectations like 1 is the percentage of", "83:47", "people who are actually gay who just", "83:50", "can't act on it because it just it but", "83:53", "their mom or their
