"37:49", "destination with this tree right so I", "37:51", "walked and walked and I came at the tree", "37:53", "and I was eating the mushrooms and and", "37:56", "then I started feeling the effects and", "37:57", "so it was great because I was climbing", "37:58", "the tree and I was getting higher in the", "38:00", "tree and higher in my brain well that", "38:02", "seems like a terrible thing to

how human beings", "64:45", "started elaborating on language oh I", "64:48", "think he's correct on that because", "64:49", "glossolalia and we know that", "64:52", "neurogenesis occurs in the

under the experience that so", "65:06", "Simon speaking the neurogenesis and", "65:08", "exactly what we've been talking about is", "65:09", "that basically your hippocampus is your", "65:13", "Centre

motherfucker yes it was a", "66:17", "weirdest I mean I haven't told anyone", "66:19", "this in 30 years but I went up to a", "66:24", "place called Montana books in Seattle", "66:26", "and I had my

was told to go up", "66:37", "there and I made an appointment and I go", "66:39", "in I'm meeting with a publisher and he", "66:40", "goes listen this is an interesting", "66:41", "little field guide you wrote but this is", "66:44", "not our market you know you really need", "66:46", "a book representative you need an agent", "66:49", "and so the best agent I know by far is", "66:52", "Bill Webb
