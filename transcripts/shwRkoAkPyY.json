and the", "67:23", "final product was basically megyn kelly", "67:26", "like looking incredibly poised saying", "67:29", "you know you're wrong Alex you're wrong", "67:31", "about this and then it would cut to how", "67:32", "that's going but but then we cut to", "67:35", "Megan so all they did was lie edit Alex", "67:38", "at his most sweaty and stuttery", "67:40", "hmm and then megyn kelly at her most", "67:43", "poised and perfect so did you see you", "67:46", "hear the Alex Jones audio the leaked", "67:48", "audio that he released yes where they", "67:50", "were sort of buttering him up

they did", "68:01", "read it so I I wonder what the original", "68:04", "program would have been like because", "68:06", "they felt forced to base it by him yeah", "68:09", "well they felt forced by like the people", "68:11", "pushing back against them doing it yeah", "68:14", "to then put out this shitty you know ten", "68:18", "minutes I wish to say yeah it was in", "68:20", "Megyn Kelly's

do", "69:49", "that that's a terrible move they're not", "69:51", "gonna accept you this is not gonna work", "69:53", "and the ratings have been horrendous and", "69:55", "now she's fit now they pulled the show", "69:57", "they pulled the show early but it just", "69:59", "goes to show light you know we rightly", "70:01", "attack people like info was for", "70:05", "spreading you know

sees at NBC so the mainstream", "70:25", "right has its own tricks it's like it's", "70:27", "not an outright lie like Alex would do", "70:31", "mm-hmm but that you know panicky", "70:34", "selective editing it's a way of its own", "70:36", "well I would I would have imagined that", "70:39", "like during the interview between Alex", "70:41", "and megyn kelly alex would have said", "70:43", "some things that were you know eloquent", "70:46", "or or or substance without a stammer in", "70:48", "a sweat i'm sure yeah well here's a also", "70:52", "problem and having any sort of a", "70:55",
