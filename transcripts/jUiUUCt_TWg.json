"10:11", "just make better helmets and better pads", "10:13", "but according to the guys who really", "10:15", "study traumatic brain injury that's not", "10:17", "really gonna help because it's the", "10:18", "impact yeah though the head the brain", "10:22", "swashing around inside your skull that", "10:24", "is just so the the amount of mass that", "10:28", "you have these guys colliding into

the ground you can hang on", "10:57", "you could try to submit someone you can", "10:59", "try to wrestle with them there's not a", "11:01", "lot of options in boxing you know", "11:03", "yeah

dangerous guy", "38:20", "this is so much talent that division", "38:22", "yeah it's an amazing division really", "38:24", "yeah 145 is one of the if you look at", "38:27", "stack divisions one of the most", "38:29", "Activision's in the sport yeah I think", "38:31", "so yes that for sure", "38:33", "it's a lot of killing a lot of killers", "38:34", "in there and now they all go there their", "38:36", "eyes on me so I well I was so impressed", "38:39", "with the fight you fought against max", "38:41", "because for to fight your style for five", "38:44", "rounds you have to be in tremendous", "38:47", "shape because you have a such an", "38:49", "explosive style your style is so", "38:52", "movement leg leg kick heavy and then", "38:55", "power shots I mean you're throwing so", "38:57", "many power punches like to just your", "38:59", "sheer output and you're not touching", "39:00", "people you're smashing you know mean", "39:03", "it's like it's a very it's a very", "39:05", "difficult style to maintain for five", "39:07", "rounds yeah well it is but you know", "39:09", "again I've always been a hard worker and", "39:11", "we train hard we definitely yeah we all", "39:15", "put in putting out we under if you've", "39:17", "ever we call a workout we do despite we", "39:20", "call it spider I was named after someone", "39:22", "but yes spider so it's just literally", "39:24", "fight gone ban and it's just the hardest", "39:27", "whatever you're fighting if it's a free", "39:29", "rounder you'll do the free rounds it's a", "39:30", "five-round you do the five round it's", "39:32", "like the hardest five-minute rounds that", "39:34", "you can think of and like they just put", "39:37", "your you versus everyone like the", "39:38", "atmosphere is absolutely", "39:40", "crazy and lucky if you just say in the", "39:41", "workout you'll be like well you know", "39:43", "that okay that explains why I spit you", "39:45", "know what I mean it's it's crazy really", "39:47", "is so we put the hard yards in and you", "39:49", "know obviously to have a star like like", "39:50", "that like you said you know you got to", "39:52", "put the work in but again it as you're", "39:54", "saying like you know obviously they're", "39:56", "not just touching like there's a lot of", "39:57", "big shots but you know I always try and", "39:59", "break the rhythm so a lot of times I I", "40:00", "am you know there will be a couple touch", "40:03", "and then couple cuts end and run through", "40:04", "and I just try and mix it up really well", "40:06", "and I think that we worked really well", "40:07", "we've max obviously gets a real date but", "40:09", "I won't get do them up be remiss I can't", "40:12", "give too much right well you could give", "40:15", "away this what was the game plan coming", "40:16", "into that fight and was anything unusual", "40:18", "for you like when when you actually", "40:20", "wound up fighting max was there anything", "40:22", "once you were actually in the Octagon", "40:24", "with him was anything unusual not like", "40:27", "everything pretty much went to how we", "40:29", "thought it was gonna go so that he made", "40:31", "adjustments during that fight we both", "40:33", "were adjusting so you know I don't know", "40:34", "if many people would have would have", "40:36", "seen it but even when it come to just a", "40:38", "way like you know I would go in the", "40:39", "nutrient counter and then you would be", "40:40", "like pretend to counter then pull back", "40:42", "then counter you know nummy well short", "40:43", "of just having these little battles but", "40:45", "always leg kicks were going to be a big", "40:47", "part not just to hurt his leg but just", "40:50", "to really break his with him and you", "40:51", "know and make him you know obviously he", "40:53", "loves that jab and he stays pretty heavy", "40:56", "on that front leg yes and whether that's", "40:58", "you know making him adjust you know he", "41:01", "stance and and just putting him in a", "41:02", "position that he's not comfortable with", "41:04", "and he's been fighting forever in this", "41:06", "style and been so effective for him so", "41:08", "you know him even been a couple inches", "41:10", "back you know so he's not so heavy on", "41:12", "that front leg that just froze his whole", "41:14", "rhythm up you know I mean and that's", "41:16", "what a lot of people it's funny a lot of", "41:17", "people gonna go he's gonna make", "41:18", "adjustments he's gonna check the kicks", "41:20", "and all that be good remember he's you", "41:22", "know he's a volume fighter", "41:23", "if he starts adjusting so much you know", "41:26", "I mean starts worrying about all that", "41:27", "then he can't stick to a game that's", "41:29", "been so successful for himself so uh I", "41:31", "don't know I'm expecting the same thing", "41:33", "I'm expecting a guard and do my thing", "41:34", "but again you will mix it up but I give", "41:37", "too much away right you saw some", "41:38", "adjustments where he switched to", "41:39", "southpaw do you guys anticipate that as", "41:41", "well", "41:41", "yeah yeah yeah we anticipated that yeah", "41:43", "so that was a again like you're gonna", "41:44", "hit you know smack the leg that many", "41:46", "times I'm sure you know yeah but again", "41:48", "it's just even though you know he does", "41:51", "switch stances a lot so we were ready", "41:53", "for", "41:53", "but I mean for him to actually do the", "41:55", "whole rounding in Southport I think", "41:57", "there was a third round or later in the", "41:58", "second he sort of switched but in the", "42:01", "third he was left out but for a while", "42:02", "and that's where you know I was probably", "42:03", "my biggest around it's very couple lot", "42:04", "so then he tried to come back to", "42:06", "Orthodox but you know just again I'm so", "42:09", "so good at playing what's in front of me", "42:11", "so he did make adjustments and I", "42:12", "adjusted again and it's just again I", "42:14", "think that goes back to training we've", "42:16", "so many
