is one of the many craters that", "08:13", "they found during the time period of", "08:15", "12,500 BC or twelve thousand five", "08:18", "hundred years ago rather to ten thousand", "08:20", "years

"now well we're lucky we've just been", "08:32", "through a really lucky stage but what", "08:34", "he's saying essentially is that this is", "08:36", "what wiped out the Egyptian civilization", "08:38", "the first Egyptian civilization this is", "08:41", "what wiped out the civilization that", "08:43", "built Gobekli Tepe", "08:45", "this is what wiped out the civilization", "08:48", "that preceded", "08:49", "sumar\u00e9 and ancient babylon and", "08:52", "mesopotamia that all those were a", "08:54", "rebuild of uh I can't wait for him to", "08:57", "come back on again he's coming back on", "08:59", "again Graham Hancock is coming back on", "09:00", "again I think listening debate that", "09:02", "other guy you had on the podcast it was", "09:04", "Grant", "09:05", "yeah Wells Michael Shermer was also", "09:06", "actually a friend of mine who I like", "09:08", "yeah he's he's a skeptic and there's an", "09:11", "issue with skeptics and that the issue", "09:13", "is not that it's not good to be", "09:15", "skeptical it's very good to be skeptical", "09:17", "the problem is when you approach things", "09:19", "as a skeptic you're not approaching them", "09:21", "as a scientist and I'm not saying that", "09:22", "Michael does this but that I think he", "09:25", "did in that debate I think it was a", "09:26", "mistake people they approach these", "09:28", "things looking to debunk them rather", "09:31", "than objectively assessing all the", "09:34", "possible evidence right and so because", "09:36", "of that you miss out on big thing like", "09:38", "this is evidence this is not like", "09:40", "Bigfoot tracks or some shit like that", "09:42", "this is fucking real evidence of a", "09:45", "crater that they have dated back to", "09:47", "twelve thousand five hundred years ago", "09:49", "yeah but people have a hard time", "09:51", "believing in doomsday scenarios because", "09:54", "it kind of like you know when you talk", "09:57", "about taking the entire chessboard and", "09:59", "throw it in the air and you have", "10:00", "evidence for it look at global warming", "10:03", "and stuff like that where there is a I", "10:05", "really believe that people have if", "10:07", "whether it's latent or not a religious", "10:10", "notion that we are ultimately sacred and", "10:14", "that God would never do something that", "10:16", "terrible to us on mass I really I really", "10:19", "believe that like humanity itself to go", "10:22", "away no because that would make no sense", "10:24", "where we're moving in a certain", "10:26", "direction we're making progress there's", "10:29", "there's this sort of neural net it's", "10:31", "becoming easier to understand what it is", "10:33", "to be each other you know and and that's", "10:37", "kind of what virtual reality and being", "10:39", "able to download other people's brains", "10:41", "will eventually do yeah that probably", "10:43", "brings us into one I guess universal", "10:46", "consciousness I mean you can go on and", "10:48", "on so the idea that that would be all", "10:49", "obliterated before it happens before the", "10:52", "singularity for example happens is too", "10:54", "much to bear", "10:55", "it would make no sense for us because we", "10:57", "have this narrative that we all kind of", "11:00", "adhere to it's very easy to do that", "11:03", "it's in the psychological sort sort of I", "11:06", "want to say I want to say a trick that", "11:09", "we play on ourselves but it's really a", "11:11", "defense mechanism mm-hmm it's a little", "11:13", "trick that we try to pretend that we're", "11:14", "important god damn it just look up at", "11:17", "the sky and although you can't see it", "11:20", "there are stars that are being swallowed", "11:22", "up by black holes yeah like if the", "11:25", "universe doesn't give a fuck about", "11:27", "something that's a million times bigger", "11:28", "than the earth yeah why would you think", "11:30", "he gives a fuck about you it's eating", "11:32", "stars that's a terrible question most", "11:34", "people that's a terrible insulting", "11:36", "question the problem you know that's", "11:37", "kind of what who was it Albert Camus the", "11:40", "French existentialist and Sartre and all", "11:42", "those guys they were saying like Camus", "11:44", "said the fundamental question is why", "11:46", "wouldn't you why not just commit suicide", "11:48", "because everything is totally absurd and", "11:50", "nothing means anything right it's like", "11:52", "the rock of Sisyphus that you keep", "11:53", "pushing up and it keeps rolling down and", "11:55", "then he said but but the truth is most", "11:58", "people don't want to kill themselves but", "11:59", "they'll commit philosophical suicide", "12:01", "meaning instead of like really starting", "12:04", "to ask these questions and really", "12:05", "getting into it and realizing that it's", "12:07", "all hopeless and despair you know you", "12:10", "you just you just go on to a certain", "12:13", "philosophy that gives you hope religion", "12:15", "yeah or whatever it might be which is", "12:17", "what it is and maybe the way out of that", "12:20", "is just to enjoy every day taste your", "12:22", "food enjoy your friends and realize that", "12:24", "it could end in any in any second you", "12:27", "know one
