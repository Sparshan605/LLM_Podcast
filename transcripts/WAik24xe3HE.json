"95:06", "she's gonna swell up right and I know", "95:08", "that so for me the game plan was very", "95:13", "simple very specific there were pieces", "95:15", "of the game plan that worked the right", "95:17", "leg kick moved her where we needed to", "95:18", "move her the left body kick was also", "95:20", "part of the game plan to take away what", "95:22", "we needed Alexis wasn't

didn't", "95:42", "happen", "95:43", "I could sit back and be mad at the", "95:45", "fighter or I can sit back and say you", "95:46", "miss this in training you need to figure", "95:49", "out how to avoid this you need to learn", "95:51", "from it and that's what I do every", "95:52", "single fight when you're watching fights", "95:55", "at home and you see like a guy one of", "96:00", "things

bit and then inexplicably they", "96:09", "stop but there's a reason they stop", "96:12", "there on it they're not they're not", "96:14", "conditioning their shin and they're", "96:15", "hurting themselves 100% I could be they", "96:19", "hurt him with a right hand and they got", "96:21", "punch happy most that - but most of the", "96:24", "time when I see people stop", "96:25", "getting on a leg kick that works it's", "96:27", "because they're feeling it in there like", "96:28", "- because they don't condition their", "96:29", "shins properly", "96:30", "that's why I've talked to people about", "96:32", "it and this so for me you're absolutely", "96:34", "right you rock somebody the right hand", "96:35", "you go ahead hunting 100% but a lot of", "96:38", "the time people do not condition their", "96:41", "legs they don't you know now you've got", "96:42", "everybody going after the calf kick", "96:43", "right and if you don't know how to throw", "96:45", "a calf kick and if you don't know how to", "96:46", "deal with if you go after a calf kick", "96:49", "invariably you're going to catch in a", "96:51", "lot of the time so if you're not", "96:54", "conditioning your leg you okay you land", "96:56", "a couple cab kicks but you know when you", "96:59", "talk about Mighty Mouse you know he", "97:00", "landed a beautiful calf kick in that", "97:02", "first round that's

fight he's got", "97:10", "videos of it on right now and and and", "97:15", "that's very easy to do if you know how", "97:18", "to check literally if you check properly", "97:20", "you lost hair of calf kicks at all yeah", "97:23", "I know I'm just gonna check it like I", "97:24", "might eat one like mad snail for example", "97:27", "he comes down and he trains with us he", "97:28", "loves to throw a calf kicks on like all", "97:30", "right throw it I'm just gonna it's gonna", "97:32", "check it every time I'll counter", "97:34", "properly if you know how to check a leg", "97:37", "kick and you know how to check a calf", "97:38", "kick you're gonna hurt the person doing", "97:39", "it 1% of the time what do you recommend", "97:41", "for cash and conditioning nothing crazy", "97:45", "progressive dense contact so starting", "97:50", "with a heavy bag and then a more densely", "97:53", "packed heavy bag and then eventually you", "97:54", "can get to a sandbag yeah that's what we", "97:57", "do we've got three different levels of", "97:59", "bag in the gym and we've got standard", "98:01", "bag densely packed bag and then sandbag", "98:05", "sandbag yeah mm-hmm damn who makes a", "98:08", "sandbag nobody does you make it yeah no", "98:14", "kicking sticks or anything no so what do", "98:17", "you how do you know what kind of liner", "98:20", "do you use to fill up with sand so it's", "98:22", "a standard uses so you can put a liner", "98:25", "in or if you've got a really good bag", "98:26", "then you know it'll be okay but you put", "98:29", "in basically a garbage bag a well done", "98:31", "garbage bag long contract and then and", "98:35", "then you don't want to go just sand it's", "98:37", "still stuffing rocks", "98:38", "yeah stuffing and sand a stuffing and", "98:42", "sand and then you build from there and", "98:43", "then it'll be denser at the bottom and", "98:46", "then you start kicking higher and then", "98:47", "you work your way down the bag", "98:49", "and it's not even about cracking it it's", "98:51", "just about conditioning the shin evenly", "98:54", "as possible just deadening it up and", "98:56", "putting those little calcium deposits", "98:58", "all those absolutely as evenly as", "98:59", "possible that's why I'm not a big fan of", "99:00", "the the rolling and the hitting and", "99:03", "because all you're doing is you're just", "99:04", "you're you're creating these little", "99:06", "micro breaks and fractures in variable", "99:08", "spots it's not spreading across the shin", "99:11", "the same way when you have a kicking", "99:13", "target like a bag it also seems like if", "99:15", "you're throwing kicks it's gonna be a", "99:17", "more realistic application you know it's", "99:19", "like throwing kicks on something and", "99:21", "hardening your shins up just seems I", "99:23", "I've seen guys do that with like coke", "99:25", "bottles you know I've seen all that", "99:27", "stuff it just doesn't snow whenever it", "99:29", "doesn't work and that I've never done", "99:30", "that in my life really yeah I use that", "99:33", "Samba I use the sandbag yeah how often", "99:35", "you use it well especially I used to", "99:38", "even more so when I have moist ie or a", "99:39", "kickboxing fights coming up but I'll use", "99:42", "it every day yeah absolutely just", "99:44", "doesn't have to be something that's out", "99:46", "rails at a time trails you know it's", "99:48", "amazing how much that low calf kick has", "99:50", "made its way into MMA and how much it", "99:52", "changes

got", "109:37", "right it's like we have feel like we got", "109:39", "five rounds to work here right that's", "109:41", "where the Kevin's had the most", "109:42", "with kickboxing is because he's used to", "109:44", "five rounds and the first round is just", "109:46", "kind of feel amount right you know right", "109:49", "so as coaches it's our job to change", "109:52", "that and that's how I struggle with that", "109:54", "a lot with my Thai guys because again", "109:56", "I'll make like Zoila", "109:57", "I'll make Gaston I had these guys fight", "109:59", "when we tie fights as well because it's", "110:01", "definitely going to help your striking", "110:02", "but if you fixate on that rhythm that", "110:06", "footwork that timing and MMA that's", "110:09", "where you're gonna have the most trouble", "110:11", "so those karate stylists are gonna give", "110:13", "you trouble and the wrestlers are gonna", "110:14", "give you trouble because you're never", "110:15", "gonna be
