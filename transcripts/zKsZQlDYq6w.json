"mammoth but just a miniature version", "07:58", "yeah really crazy wooly furry shaggy", "08:01", "yeah goat essentially yeah like a goat", "08:04", "slash sheep but I mean the funny part", "08:07", "about all that is when yours is right", "08:08", "there it's they look like where we were", "08:12", "you would look across these little these", "08:14", "alpine valleys and you'd see them look", "08:16", "like a black bear looks like a giant", "08:18", "black bear you're saying where am I and", "08:21", "what is that thing God so it because I'm", "08:24", "not like you have some really cool", "08:25", "adventurers like on this podcast That's", "08:28", "not me", "08:28", "when I see that thing I think what and", "08:31", "where am I like it's it's wild looking", "08:35", "yeah and they live you know up in the", "08:37", "Alpine so they're you've got the", "08:38", "beechwood forest which is probably if I", "08:40", "would just say hiking straight up for", "08:41", "about an hour and a half or two hours", "08:43", "and is that an invasion species for", "08:45", "isn't New Zealand they're feral", "08:47", "we're not fair that's I know they're", "08:48", "non-native so all the mammals on the", "08:50", "island they're not native all of them", "08:51", "and they're all were introduced by and I", "08:54", "wish I had really looked up some", "08:56", "specifics but they are all introduced by", "08:57", "some other countries you're upset", "08:58", "animals over there Teddy Roosevelt sent", "09:00", "some animals over there like hey here", "09:01", "you don't want these and so the the", "09:05", "problem over there", "09:06", "to get on a whole different subject is", "09:07", "that the the people on that island the", "09:10", "residents of New Zealand don't value", "09:12", "there's animals as part of the landscape", "09:14", "they're just there", "09:16", "I mean feral would be a good term to the", "09:18", "way they view them to the value they", "09:20", "have one and we have like yeah moose and", "09:22", "mule deer that's that's part of our", "09:23", "ethos as a country right and our", "09:26", "ecosystem yeah and our ecosystem they've", "09:27", "been here before we were at some level", "09:30", "and so over there they just they'll jump", "09:32", "in a helicopter and mow down like 40 red", "09:34", "stag on a weekend because they want to", "09:36", "control the population one because", "09:38", "there's no winter kill no predation all", "09:39", "that stuff but they also just don't see", "09:42", "a big red stag the way we see a big elk", "09:44", "they just don't they don't have the", "09:46", "value for it down there well it's also", "09:48", "the the weird thing about having no", "09:51", "predators is how do you handle that do", "09:53", "you bring in predators like if they", "09:54", "don't they risk disease and there's all", "09:57", "sorts of weird things that can happen", "09:58", "like like they have on Lanai yes yeah", "10:01", "and so that's it right and and we've had", "10:03", "we've done that in this country with", "10:04", "bringing down North West what's the", "10:06", "timber wolf that we brought them down", "10:08", "and put them in the States and that's", "10:09", "while that may seem like a good solution", "10:11", "and we when we were in British Columbia", "10:14", "hunt moose together we saw some calf", "10:16", "skeletons", "10:17", "yeah we've showed that picture on the", "10:19", "podcast who's counting yeah see the", "10:21", "thing had just been decimated yeah those", "10:23", "wolves and I've saw in Montana one time", "10:25", "I saw them running circles they run in", "10:27", "like concentric circle around like a", "10:29", "bull's eye pattern when they're hunting", "10:30", "I feel like the packs and I just watched", "10:35", "we were I'd killed my open the first day", "10:37", "of this hunt and I was watching and you", "10:41", "would show there would be a different", "10:42", "wolf kill like every other day in this", "10:44", "valley and it's like the wolves were", "10:46", "just run in circles and I did see a", "10:48", "couple wolves fighting that but in that", "10:50", "trip trying to call him in yeah I saw", "10:52", "them financially yeah two of them Wow it", "10:55", "was like twelve hundred yards away and I", "10:56", "had a rifle out-of-state I was thinking", "10:58", "about it but I mean once you see when", "11:00", "you see a deadfall", "11:01", "on every day you go honey it's pretty a", "11:03", "new it maybe not new to that day but new", "11:06", "that week you started to think like how", "11:09", "if this pact worked this valley for a", "11:11", "full year what could they do right and", "11:14", "there's numbers to that somewhere it's", "11:15", "some people figured out what", "11:16", "how many elk a year upon the other Sun", "11:19", "feel before the wolves were reintroduced", "11:21", "there was an issue with overpopulation", "11:23", "so it's so that's where I think that's", "11:25", "probably were hunters come in yeah you", "11:26", "know you could I I value that animal I'm", "11:29", "willing to pay you for the opportunity", "11:31", "to help you conserve that population", "11:33", "right and so that's that becomes very", "11:35", "problematic for people like when you", "11:36", "start talking about wolves yes like dogs", "11:39", "it does wolves are Oneidas are another", "11:42", "one of those ones that black bears to I", "11:44", "mean I think it's you don't eat him I", "11:46", "mean I think more than any yeah wolves", "11:48", "way more than anything yeah that was", "11:50", "talking to it there was a Gallup my work", "11:52", "that I was talking to and she lives in", "11:54", "Austin Texas and is very not a hunter", "11:55", "but works at Yeti and so she's around", "11:59", "honey and we were talking about wolves", "12:00", "and I just said look I don't have a", "12:02", "really hardened opinion on wolves I've", "12:04", "not spent enough time around them I just", "12:06", "know that they're meat processors on", "12:08", "four legs they give no shits about", "12:11", "anything they don't they're not just", "12:13", "eating they don't just eat what fills", "12:15", "their belly they eat and then they eat", "12:17", "more and they kill more and that's all", "12:19", "they're wired to do right I've seen that", "12:20", "in action so that's all I really know I", "12:22", "don't know whether that's good for an", "12:24", "ecosystem bad whatever and and she just", "12:27", "said well I don't really know that it's", "12:28", "hunting has really bad wolves wolves", "12:30", "seem to have a good PR agent and hunting", "12:32", "and management having a terrible PR", "12:34", "agent you know so I think that you know", "12:36", "that's that's part of the problem that", "12:38", "there's a sect of people that are really", "12:39", "glorifying a wolf for good reason I mean", "12:42", "as awesome animal majestic animal but at", "12:44", "the same time there's a juxtaposition to", "12:46", "that that needs to be told to well I", "12:48", "think a big part of the issue is that", "12:50", "people know that they virtually wiped", "12:52", "them out in North America yeah at one", "12:54", "point in time and I think people feel", "12:55", "guilty about that yeah well then they", "12:57", "should feel guilty they should feel", "12:58", "ashamed about the mallard duck and elk", "13:01", "people don't know in the whitetail yeah", "13:03", "but we brought those back to the point", "13:05", "where the numbers are higher than", "13:06", "they've ever been before but right those", "13:07", "same people don't know how that happened", "13:09", "though right those same people aren't", "13:11", "aware of how they just see white tails", "13:12", "around they're like", "13:13", "that's annoying yeah he bought the car", "13:15", "they don't know that turn-of-the-century", "13:16", "they were almost all gone yeah because", "13:18", "we market hunting them to hell", "13:20", "and so that I think that's there's just", "13:23", "it's just education man I just think", "13:24", "people need to to seek the other side", "13:27", "which I always try to do and you do all", "13:29", "the time just seek whatever the other", "13:31", "side is and the hunting is not always", "13:32", "the way to go yeah but it's inconvenient", "13:34", "because like it's it's hard like if you", "13:37", "say if you're a vegetarian or a vegan", "13:38", "you're gonna get your information from", "13:40", "animal rights activists and it's going", "13:43", "to be biased in that direction or if", "13:45", "you're a hunter you're gonna get your", "13:47", "information from hunting and", "13:49", "conservation groups and it might be", "13:50", "biased in the other way I think wolves", "13:52", "are a good thing cuz they're awesome you", "13:55", "know I don't not I don't not like wolves", "13:57", "well I think no hunter is like wipe the", "13:59", "Wolves I've never heard that I've just", "14:01", "heard like what's the carrying capacity", "14:02", "for this state this region for wolves", "14:04", "right how many can there be and and I", "14:07", "know in a lot of cases you know the", "14:08", "biologists would say one thing like okay", "14:10", "the hundred wolves in this area and then", "14:13", "when it ballooned up to a thousand they", "14:15", "argued for hundreds come in and help put", "14:17", "that population down they were still a", "14:19", "push back like wait a minute we said we", "14:21", "agreed upon", "14:22", "scientifically by biologically you know", "14:25", "we you know the problem is that it's", "14:27", "negotiable at all it should have been", "14:28", "like once the Wolves hit 2000 starting", "14:31", "then you start a hunting scenes but then", "14:33", "the real issue is it's incredibly hard", "14:36", "to shoot a wolf like it's not as simple", "14:39", "as like you out and find a wolf and kill", "14:41", "them well they're really smart they", "14:42", "think about tar in New Zealand you can't", "14:44", "just like if they're overpopulated in", "14:46", "there you can't just like I will just", "14:47", "walk up the hill and crack a couple I", "14:49", "mean that's that's a pretty big feat so", "14:51", "they jump in a helicopter they gunned", "14:53", "down the guitar that way - mmm really", "14:55", "goddamn so how do they determine whether", "14:58", "or not they should be gunning them down", "14:59", "it's a you know and I don't know like", "15:01", "the holistic method they used I know our", "15:03", "guide up there this year was just", "15:05", "talking about he would go to the Sheep", "15:07", "stations or the ranch owners or some of", "15:09", "the areas some of those big mountain", "15:11", "areas are owned privately and some of", "15:14", "the areas where they were down

"30:27", "on it it can be good I would argue it's", "30:30", "not to be celebrated like it's not that", "30:32", "good it's it is not as well it depends", "30:35", "apparently if you eat a blueberry bear", "30:37", "is one of the best meats ever yeah", "30:40", "remember raves about see if Rinella does", "30:42", "I I've had I've eaten a lot of bears and", "30:45", "I like eating him I'm not I wouldn't", "30:47", "throw him away or whatever so I would", "30:49", "continue to hunt him but I've never had", "30:51", "that same feeling of like an elk", "30:53", "tenderloin or elk backstrap like it's", "30:54", "just not an asset or an access it's not", "30:56", "in that category so I feel like maybe we", "30:58", "overcompensate a little bit", "31:00", "because there's so much pushback on", "31:01", "bear-hunting right we start talking", "31:02", "about how great it is it's really good", "31:04", "but it's not like it's not it doesn't", "31:06", "get that next level have you had smoked", "31:08", "bear ham now I have that's pretty damn", "31:11", "good", "31:12", "but that's one of those things where", "31:13", "it's like it's smoked its Brian yeah", "31:15", "treed yes and and that's the biggest", "31:17", "thing right and you can most meats that", "31:20", "you're gonna go hunting for you treat", "31:21", "you look at the cut of meat and you", "31:23", "treat it accordingly right

love rare meat", "31:34", "that may be my problem I don't know I", "31:35", "think maybe I think maybe a little bit", "31:37", "we could address the fact that hunters a", "31:38", "little bit of overcompensating for the", "31:40", "fact that people are pushing back on", "31:42", "them so much with and then they're like", "31:43", "I love bear it's like it's good right", "31:46", "but I wouldn't choose it in my favor I", "31:48", "wouldn't choose it over a lot of other", "31:49", "meats right if you have like it's bad", "31:50", "but like if someone told me you have to", "31:52",

mean if you", "32:35", "pick that example because largemouth", "32:37", "bass tastes bare tastes way better than", "32:39", "largemouth we're going down the track", "32:42", "like largemouth bass this doesn't taste", "32:44", "that pays better than largemouth bass", "32:46", "right did you read largemouth", "32:47", "no it's okay so here's some delicious", "32:51", "fresh water fish dilute he'll

the the bear thing", "34:41", "is a very strange one and I I definitely", "34:44", "don't like hunting them like I like", "34:46", "hunting anything else and I struggle", "34:48", "with that like I as a hunter I feel like", "34:49", "coming on and talking as a hunter I", "34:51", "don't want to like despair disparage", "34:53", "anything but I also just want to be 100%", "34:55", "honest about every part of it and", "34:56", "hunting is this really complex activity", "34:59", "and I feel completely conflicted about", "35:01", "it almost every time I go like not about", "35:04", "killing in or hunting but just got", "35:05", "little parts of what's going on yeah and", "35:07", "so bear much also sometimes you just", "35:08", "want to like Rinella said this once and", "35:10", "I never understood it until it happened", "35:11", "to me he's like I just want to watch him", "35:14", "sometimes I don't really want to hunt", "35:15", "them and it's it's yeah what is hunting", "35:18", "anyway is hunting killing or was hunting", "35:20", "getting close enough to like or anything", "35:22", "yeah it's the whole thing I think my", "35:24", "opinion on that specific point is", "35:27", "one I would go back to I always ask", "35:30", "myself two questions why are you going", "35:32", "and and does this hunting benefit the", "35:36", "place and the animal that you're hunting", "35:38", "and if I can't answer those questions", "35:40", "myself and I always strip away", "35:42", "conservation and meat from the first", "35:45", "question well you have a very good way", "35:46", "of looking at this but I think it's very", "35:48", "honest I think this is super important", "35:49", "is that conservation is essentially a", "35:52", "side effect of hunting it's a byproduct", "35:54", "right and to pretend that it's the whole", "35:56", "thing it's almost like a weird it's it's", "35:59", "a disingenuous approach to the argument", "36:01", "but really saying you shouldn't be", "36:03", "hunting will say well hunting is", "36:04", "conservation and hunters of the best", "36:06", "conservationists okay that's well that's", "36:08", "true but part of that is true but it's", "36:10", "not really why you're doing there and", "36:11", "there's in here's the the biggest point", "36:13", "to make there's semantic chinks in that", "36:15", "armor right we've built up over the", "36:16", "years as hunters like the use of organic", "36:18", "meat and conservation is this like armor", "36:20", "right right that insulates why we go and", "36:23", "I think there's just jinx in that armor", "36:25", "that if we don't recognize those points", "36:28", "especially the conservation when I think", "36:29", "that's a bigger deal like conservation", "36:32", "hunting is a tool for conservation it's", "36:34", "the same way as translocation is a tool", "36:36", "conservationists you can move the animal", "36:39", "to get them away from a certain", "36:40", "situation reintroduce animal that's one", "36:44", "way or bring in hunters and help manage", "36:47", "the population that way but it's that", "36:49", "first question right is why do I go and", "36:51", "I always say it's like we've had", "36:55", "experiences you and I together in the", "36:56", "woods that I wouldn't we couldn't", "36:58", "replicate anywhere else like you've done", "36:59", "a lot of cool shit and there's some like", "37:02", "when you ran down the road after chef", "37:04", "boots like there's just something about", "37:07", "that for me that is way more fulfilling", "37:10", "and enriching to my life than any other", "37:12", "thing I've experienced may I have", "37:14", "experienced everything but all the", "37:16", "things that I've done well it's so", "37:17", "primal right and so it's that it's", "37:19", "learning about animals you're in the", "37:21", "woods too you're also in and really", "37:23", "almost like you're a visitor in an alien", "37:25", "world exactly and so you learn about", "37:27", "these animals you develop skills I feel", "37:30", "like you wouldn't develop any other way", "37:32", "so and on and on it goes I mean there's", "37:34", "probably a hundred reasons that I and I", "37:36", "discover a new one every time I go and", "37:38", "so I always say like that's the", "37:40", "the first question why do I go it's not", "37:42", "like man I'm real hungry and I want to", "37:44", "control the population I'm aware as I go", "37:47", "hunting that the two those two things", "37:48", "are byproducts of my efforts then", "37:50", "they're always gonna be byproducts in my", "37:52", "efforts unless I'm poaching right you", "37:54", "know I'm there is a biologist a state", "37:57", "wildlife biologist federal biologists", "37:59", "that determine what tags go where what", "38:01", "animals they're moving pieces of the", "38:02", "puzzle around to keep this thing the way", "38:05", "it is right keep it healthy keep it", "38:07", "stable but they're also looking at", "38:09", "what's the economic impact of that all", "38:11", "that's going on while I'm out there", "38:12", "thinking I got to kill this big buck but", "38:15", "I'm not thinking while I'm out there", "38:16", "with my bow I'm not thinking well I'd", "38:19", "like to kill that one because that'll", "38:20", "really stabilize this area right I'm out", "38:23", "there and I'm kill that one cuz I really", "38:25", "like backstraps I know those two things", "38:26", "are happening but they're almost like we", "38:29", "pull that away from from what's actually", "38:31", "going on and focus on why you're there", "38:33", "like why do you go why did you go to the", "38:35", "nigh like what somebody said why'd you", "38:38", "go what would you say two reasons one to", "38:42", "bow hunt for meat for sure because I", "38:44", "wanted to eat access deer and two", "38:46", "because I think that it's great practice", "38:49", "one of the hardest things about ball", "38:51", "hunting is just you can practice all day", "38:54", "on a target but it's almost like never", "38:56", "sparring like you could practice all day", "38:59", "hitting a heavy bag but you've never", "39:01", "haven't hit a person right like once", "39:03", "you're in front of a person things get", "39:04", "weird when there's a chink in the armor", "39:06", "right so you so if I practice on the", "39:08", "handle that's terrible I would say to", "39:10", "that like that that's just another chink", "39:12", "in the armor that we all know is", "39:14", "happening like if we were", "39:15", "conservationists we would never pick up", "39:16", "a bow yeah but I'm not practicing on an", "39:18", "animal like I've never practiced before", "39:20", "right I got probably this is a", "39:21", "practicing maybe being the wrong term", "39:23", "like there's something in there that", "39:24", "like the experience of stalking an", "39:26", "animal is yeah pretty visceral and if", "39:27", "you've never done it you could shoot", "39:29", "your back are the hell you want well I", "39:30", "say practice in terms of like when you", "39:33", "compete as a young martial artist it's", "39:36", "not really practice but it is and if", "39:38", "like you're involved in competition it's", "39:41", "like are you hunting or are you", "39:42", "practicing we are definitely hunting but", "39:44", "that hunting is practice for other hunts", "39:47", "or you don't get nearly as many", "39:49", "opportunities as you do in lanai lanai", "39:51", "is the one of the best examples of a", "39:52", "place that has no", "39:54", "predators in a real problem with", "39:56", "overpopulation you weren't with me and", "39:58", "Dudley that one time where me and him", "40:00", "and his son were hanging out and we were", "40:03", "there at last light and we were watching", "40:05", "these axis deer come off the mountain", "40:08", "and we saw I don't know how many", "40:10", "hundreds I mean it might have been seven", "40:12", "eight hundred deer coming off this", "40:14", "mountain and we were like what the fuck", "40:16", "it was just crazy", "40:17", "there's ten more there's five more", "40:18", "there's six more there's 11 more there's", "40:20", "a herd of twenty like what the fuck it", "40:23", "got to the point we were like this is", "40:24", "crazy so in a place like that I feel", "40:27", "like you you have a a great ethical", "40:30", "argument for like you they're going to", "40:32", "shoot these animals period and the only", "40:34", "other way to get around it is you bring", "40:37", "in wolves yeah and if you bring in", "40:38", "wolves wolves then you have wolves and", "40:41", "these people also have dogs running", "40:42", "around on the streets and you know like", "40:44", "pet dogs so those dogs get fucked like", "40:46", "immediately they're gonna get killed by", "40:48", "wolves wolves want to take out all the", "40:49", "very possible you can't have wolves on", "40:51", "the night it's a stupid idea that's hey", "40:54", "everybody is stopped we're never gonna", "40:56", "do that but so it's one of the in terms", "40:58", "of like since in since the animals are", "41:01", "there and there there's no talk of", "41:03", "eradicating them because they have a", "41:04", "real value the people that live there", "41:06", "live off of them like all those folks", "41:09", "that we were hanging out with like Roman", "41:10", "a lot of the people that work at that", "41:12", "place they tax us all the time it is", "41:14", "without a doubt not a net it is the", "41:17", "opposite it is the most delicious gain", "41:21", "me in the world I if it's not if it's", "41:23", "not like number one it's not number one", "41:26", "it's number two yeah it's amazing it's", "41:29", "so good like we ate it at the restaurant", "41:31", "they serve the restaurant we're gonna", "41:33", "remember the burger we had that one", "41:34", "lunch oh my gosh and then the steak", "41:36", "place the steak place at that place", "41:38", "terrible there's a terrible meaning good", "41:41", "note arable I can't get out my mind", "41:44", "sliders thanks oh yeah that's your", "41:46", "sliders yeah but that's a restaurant", "41:48", "serves tenderloin and it is phenomenal", "41:51", "it's so good so why we like it that's", "41:55", "why one thing I always try to separate", "41:57", "and I try to do it only because I think", "41:59", "I try to look at it from someone else", "42:02", "who's a non hunter and it's not hearing", "42:05", "us talk or hearing me talk or whatever", "42:07", "and maybe thinking like that's a weird", "42:08", "part of that like that's that's strange", "42:10", "and so I feel like if I can say yes the", "42:14", "meat is delicious", "42:14", "yes they got to kill these things yes", "42:17", "the local people value the animal", "42:19", "because hunters exist you know they they", "42:21", "wouldn't just gun them down because", "42:22", "hunters will pay to go out there all", "42:24", "those things I think set aside what am i", "42:28", "there for like we were that group of", "42:30", "hunters we had in camp was probably I", "42:32", "mean I've hunted with a lot of awesome", "42:35", "talented folks was probably the most", "42:37", "skilled group of hunters I've ever been", "42:39", "around", "42:40", "well think about who we have we have", "42:41", "John Dudley he's arguably if not the", "42:43", "best bow hunter in the world he's in top", "42:44", "three I think it's like it's like John", "42:46", "well there's like top four like John cam", "42:49", "Remmy and Adam they Adam Greentree yeah", "42:53", "they might be all the people have fun it", "42:54", "with that stop for I would say I think", "42:56", "they might be the top four in the world", "42:57", "and if they're not if they're not top", "42:59", "four they're all during the top ten yeah", "43:01", "right so this is a yes if you think you", "43:03", "better come see us it's a clan of", "43:04", "killers yeah I mean and then you got", "43:06", "Shane Dorian he's a great bow hunter too", "43:08", "and aesthetic wave sir yes to say about", "43:11", "Shane he's fanatical like he would just", "43:14", "I'd be like hey Shane you want to let go", "43:15", "take a break get a sandwich and he'd", "43:17", "look at me like what yeah he's like no", "43:20", "we could be hunting why would we be", "43:21", "eating sandwiches he was out there all", "43:22", "day he didn't come in the bird is there", "43:26", "in lunch time when everybody else was in", "43:28", "cuz it was 95 degrees outside yeah he's", "43:30", "out there on his hands and knees", "43:31", "crawling all bushes crawling hoping to", "43:33", "find one slippin that's just forever to", "43:36", "crawl it but so that for me like one", "43:38", "reason to do that stripping away all the", "43:41", "things that I know to be right right in", "43:43", "my own mind was that was those people", "43:45", "getting them all together", "43:47", "yeah then like meeting Ramon and me and", "43:49", "Brandon and meet Alec all our guides and", "43:51", "all the locals that were there like", "43:53", "there's things I and I learned more", "43:55", "about the quick twitch muscle when I got", "43:58", "to here oh my god than I've ever learned", "44:00", "so I feel like I've learned something I", "44:01", "spent time with these people that that", "44:03", "made me better at not just funny but", "44:05", "everything well for people who've never", "44:07", "been around and access to here before", "44:08", "they evolved with Tigers so Tigers hunt", "44:11", "them I mean you've never seen an animal", "44:13", "more fast in your life how about that", "44:15", "one deer that we shot I shot at this", "44:18", "deer it was 60 yards away it was", "44:20", "looking at me and I was like I think I'm", "44:21", "gonna shoot it it's just standing there", "44:23", "by the time my arrow got there it was", "44:25", "four or five deer away it was swimming", "44:27", "to Maui it build a boat and it was", "44:30", "rowing over so sixty yards away the", "44:33", "arrows going 275 feet a second and it", "44:37", "was nowhere near it by the time it got", "44:39", "there it's like they're so fast they're", "44:43", "faster than any animal I've ever seen", "44:44", "well that lets you say like what a weird", "44:46", "scenario to be hunting an animal that", "44:48", "has been trained by tigers to avoid you", "44:51", "know what a weird thing so like that", "44:53", "that's my appreciation yeah that little", "44:55", "that little exchange of hey me and", "44:57", "tigers both hunted this thing like", "44:59", "that's that's something cool to me", "45:01", "that's a that's outside of this thing so", "45:03", "and talk about that all day and then the", "45:05", "meat look if you're gonna if you're a", "45:06", "person who values animal protein if you", "45:09", "like ethically sourced animal protein", "45:11", "there's no better way to get it than", "45:14", "than like a place like lanai like all", "45:16", "the pieces are in check do they need to", "45:17", "kill them yes", "45:18", "is there an overpopulation problem yes", "45:20", "provide jobs for local yes yes all the", "45:23", "good things I mean there's a lot of", "45:24", "positive sides to it yeah and again if", "45:27", "you're someone who enjoys bow hunting", "45:28", "like look it's an uncomfortable thing", "45:30", "for some people but I enjoy it I like it", "45:32", "I like getting my meat that way I don't", "45:34", "like I feel bad if I get bacon from a", "45:37", "store I feel like are we talking about", "45:39", "like a as predators like we are", "45:41", "predators if you look at you know it's", "45:43", "been millions of years we've been", "45:44", "killing eating things no humans are", "45:46", "herbivores and that's all a lie I don't", "45:49", "know I've done some radium predator look", "45:51", "you don't have to be a predator you", "45:52", "could live off of but aren't we though", "45:54", "we up some people but look you could", "45:57", "live by pointers if you wanted to I", "45:58", "don't want to disparage the way anybody", "46:00", "lives their life you could live off of", "46:02", "just pure vegetables you could live up", "46:03", "and by the way there's a real moral and", "46:05", "ethical argument if you are a vegan to", "46:08", "eat mollusks folks because molix are", "46:11", "more primitive than most plants they", "46:14", "don't communicate as much as plants do", "46:16", "they don't have any sense of feeling", "46:18", "they have no nerve endings that would", "46:21", "allow them to feel pain they're", "46:22", "incredibly simple organisms the only", "46:25", "thing that we have against them in terms", "46:27", "of like when we think about them as", "46:28", "being an", "46:29", "versus you know like a plant people", "46:33", "think eating a plant is cruelty free", "46:35", "eating a malice you're killing a living", "46:37", "creature right but that's just because", "46:39", "they move but a fucking Venus flytrap", "46:41", "moves too and it's probably ten times", "46:43", "smarter than like a scallop like they're", "46:45", "not smart it's hard to regulate that", "46:48", "morality it's it is but I mean I just", "46:50", "want people if you're if you're", "46:52", "uncomfortable with eating chicken I get", "46:54", "it but they're like clams and oysters", "46:56", "and those things are good for you they", "46:59", "really are and it's sustainable and the", "47:02", "animals themselves are not feeling shit", "47:05", "yeah the moral entanglements of all of", "47:07", "it is just yeah and like we you know we", "47:09", "say we're humans we wake up in the", "47:11", "morning and you consume everything like", "47:13", "you're just consuming you breathe air", "47:14", "you pump out co2 I mean every other", "47:16", "animal does too they just wander around", "47:18", "chewing on the grass consumption engines", "47:20", "like for us to to separate out one part", "47:24", "of our consumption and then like beat", "47:26", "the crap out of it even though we've", "47:27", "been doing it for two million years is", "47:29", "in and of itself kind of weird well you", "47:31", "know what I think happened", "47:33", "it's your mic on that was so weird sorry", "47:36", "loud was weird I was like it was in my", "47:38", "ear Jamie's on the ride really getting", "47:43", "crazy but I think part of the issue is", "47:46", "that people over the last 100 years or", "47:48", "so have been so removed from where the", "47:51", "meat comes from that when they're they", "47:53", "can find a direct connection like oh you", "47:56", "went and you shot a moose and then you", "47:58", "ate that moose like you were that you", "47:59", "killed the moose like you didn't have to", "48:01", "kill that moose like that that becomes", "48:04", "problematic because people aren't used", "48:06", "to someone killing

because I think it's part of a", "48:16", "human condition it's part of who we are", "48:17", "and what we do so yeah we should", "48:19", "probably fight about it a little bit and", "48:20",

hunting is like the essence of who", "48:29", "I am as a human and has made my life", "48:31", "better Brack and see how somebody else", "48:32", "would say yeah that's your killing stuff", "48:34", "I can too and I also think that those", "48:36", "people are important I think so I think", "48:38", "having vegans and having animal rights", "48:40", "activists and having to be able to have",

unethical people there's", "48:53", "people that are unethical absolutely", "48:55", "well and look at like if you I always", "48:57", "think about it you know if you look at", "48:58", "the trend of hunting and 70s honey was", "49:00", "doing great", "49:01", "and then in the 80s started to tick down", "49:03", "look in Bambi that's what happened well", "49:05", "I would say three we eyes we talked", "49:07", "about this for like three things Bambi", "49:09", "maybe Walt Disney's maybe a dick I don't", "49:11", "know", "49:12", "and then urbanization right which", "49:16", "correlated with the klein and hunting", "49:18", "and then hunters being a third one", "49:20", "mentioning we have bad we're bad PR some", "49:23", "of them are bad PR agents and awesome", "49:24", "and people like Rinella that are amazing", "49:26", "at it we're way better now than we were", "49:28", "five years ago look better tomorrow than", "49:30", "we were yesterday what I think like in", "49:32", "general like if you look at that line", "49:33", "graph right in the seventies it was", "49:34", "going nicely and the eighty-two started", "49:36", "to decline and I think 2011 was the", "49:39", "first time it actually went up over a", "49:41", "number of I think it's licensed sales or", "49:43", "number of hunters participating I wonder", "49:44", "what caused that it's like the organic", "49:46", "food there was a study that said local", "49:48", "wars they talk about more women they", "49:50", "talked about returning military members", "49:52", "I remember and reading the study I think", "49:54", "that was the top three but I think local", "49:56", "war was probably pushed out there is", "49:57", "like the way to reverse that second", "50:00", "point the way to reverse the suburban", "50:02", "and urban rise was to take that suburban", "50:05", "male or female and say you can hunt get", "50:08", "your food right and then that's a way to", "50:11", "kind of reverse the decline and I think", "50:13", "that's probably what was happening hmm", "50:15", "well everybody wants to go with locally", "50:18", "sourced locally raised grass fed people", "50:20", "are trying to go to farmers markets in", "50:23", "connect with the people that are", "50:24", "actually growing the animals and this is", "50:26", "like one step better than that instead", "50:28", "of having an animal that's in captivity", "50:30", "go out into the forest but there's a", "50:32", "rude awakening for a lot of these people", "50:33", "that think they're gonna just go ahead", "50:34", "and try it like it is not easy by any", "50:37", "stretch of the imagination that's the", "50:39", "other problem it's the Grand Canyon", "50:40", "being I would love to I would love to", "50:42", "procure my own elk meat and killing an", "50:44", "elk is like being on two sides of the", "50:46", "Grand Canyon there's no bridge to be", "50:49", "built there you got to take it one step", "50:50", "at a time and for most people that's", "50:52", "just not enough time for that they don't", "50:53", "have the want to", "50:54", "do that so I would say was it like 14", "50:56", "million hunters in the world or", "50:58", "something like that or in our country", "51:00", "how many how many non hunters who don't", "51:03", "either have like the wherewithal to be", "51:05", "to get educated or want to mm-hmm or", "51:08", "just don't fall into the anti on our", "51:10", "side like the agnostic crowd how many of", "51:13", "those are there out there right I don't", "51:15", "know but it's hundreds of millions of", "51:17", "people or you know there's a lot of them", "51:20", "well urbanization one of the things", "51:22", "that's done just just careers just", "51:24", "careers in cities it's or eliminated", "51:26", "almost all of your free time yeah and if", "51:28", "you wanted to go out and procure your", "51:30", "own meat first of all if you want to do", "51:32", "with a rifle that's gonna take a", "51:33", "tremendous amount of time but if you", "51:35", "want to do with a bow multiply that by a", "51:38", "factor of like maybe five or ten maybe a", "51:41", "ten well 10 is probably pretty honest", "51:43", "honestly and then you're talking about", "51:44", "one of the hardest pieces is access", "51:47", "right right even if you if you get with", "51:50", "John Dudley and you learn how to be", "51:51", "great Archer and you understand that in", "51:54", "your suburban area there are some places", "51:56", "where there's deer that you may kill you", "51:58", "got to get access to rich places and", "51:59", "then when you're done with that you've", "52:01", "got to figure out a way to get that", "52:02", "thing from dead deer to meat and all the", "52:04", "other things so yeah this is just so", "52:06", "complex how would you ever expect", "52:08", "somebody just to be have like a desire", "52:09", "you were like that at some point we -", "52:11", "yeah well Rinella opened the door for me", "52:14", "yeah super lucky forever grateful", "52:17", "because when he took me into a wild back", "52:21", "country Montana deer nuts it was very", "52:26", "bright in the Missouri Breaks", "52:27", "in October 9 degrees out freezing your", "52:30", "dick off every night in a tent but he's", "52:32", "like lifeless Steven Ella that's kind of", "52:34", "loves it he loves suffering he loves it", "52:36", "but I love that he loves it he's as", "52:38", "legit as they come he really is and I", "52:40", "think that's it right there is just this", "52:42", "there's this big gap and my father got", "52:46", "me into it", "52:46", "but I my brother doesn't doesn't hunt", "52:48", "and but I think has respect for and", "52:50", "understands what's going on but he just", "52:51", "I think at the time then I was", "52:53", "introduced to hunting my brother was", "52:55", "more interested in going out with his", "52:56", "friends and Saturday mornings were not", "52:58", "for getting up early and and so we're", "53:00", "essentially the same person but I just", "53:02", "went this way and he didn't go that way", "53:05", "right so it's a weird so you could be in", "53:08", "the same house with somebody in short a", "53:10", "different way well Rinella has a real", "53:11", "good way of looking at - he's like I", "53:13", "don't expect people to go out and get", "53:14", "rid of their own sewage why should I", "53:17", "expect them to go out and hunt their own", "53:19", "food like you don't have to well and", "53:20", "he's I think he probably said this at", "53:22", "some point or somebody smart did it was", "53:25", "like I choose I believe it I choose -", "53:29", "for me to be the one thing that I", "53:30", "grabbed ahold of to bring into my - my", "53:33", "skillset right I don't knit my own", "53:35", "clothes I don't I don't make my own", "53:37", "shoes I don't build my own houses you", "53:39", "know we were just looking at some", "53:41", "construction stuff a little bit earlier", "53:42", "I'm like dude I don't what yeah what are", "53:44", "they doing what are they doing yeah I", "53:46", "couldn't do that I just picked this one", "53:48", "thing because it's also part of my", "53:50", "passion so you couldn't just ask someone", "53:52", "who's a construction worker to go like", "53:55", "go hunt", "53:56",

"an industry and opinion and because we", "54:09", "could legislate ourselves out of being", "54:10", "able to hunt that could happen mining is", "54:12", "a privilege man that's not a right", "54:14", "that's in a lot of ways so that's", "54:17", "another whole nother can of worms but it", "54:19", "could it could go away yeah I think the", "54:22", "the issue is that so many people are", "54:24", "opposed to it because they're so removed", "54:26", "from the realities of the wild and they", "54:29", "just feel some sort of moral superiority", "54:31", "by either not eating meat entirely or by", "54:34", "not killing their own meat they're not", "54:36", "killing their own meat is really", "54:37", "ridiculous like my wife was having a", "54:39", "conversation with someone they were out", "54:41", "to dinner with a bunch of people while I", "54:42", "was on an elk hunt and the guy was", "54:45", "eating a steak got from England in", "54:47", "England they don't hunt or

lake", "55:21", "it's fucking weird in irony that that", "55:24", "we're like saying hey I'm eating the", "55:26", "chicken but here's a cartoon version of", "55:28", "it so we can celebrate the fact that we", "55:29", "just murder this chicken and we fried it", "55:31", "up like that doesn't make sense like a", "55:33", "swimming pool with a lake as post smart", "55:35", "because it's Paris on the rive rait", "55:36", "wearing off time for a refill is weird", "55:43", "you know what I mean", "55:44", "well we definitely like to cartoon eyes", "55:47", "these weird that'll work", "55:49", "not really cartoon not personalized no", "55:52", "well anthropomorphize is you take an", "55:54", "animal you give it human characteristics", "55:56", "personify no cartoon ofin this is go",

"61:23", "generations of people kind of were", "61:24", "introduced to a new diet and then the", "61:26", "last couple generations you have", "61:27", "processed foods right and so you like", "61:30", "everywhere that I've ever been you find", "61:32", "people struggling with that thing okay", "61:35", "we're not it's just not us in America", "61:37", "right but you can exist on a plant-based", "61:39", "diet", "61:40", "yes no a lot of people really absolutely", "61:42", "can be done and I'm sure in there's a", "61:44", "hundred thousand generations there was", "61:45", "plenty of people that didn't you know", "61:47", "exist on the hunter-gatherer diet alone", "61:49", "but the majority of money there were", "61:51", "honestly because I feel like people were", "61:53", "just really super opportunistic back", "61:56", "then I mean if you were just trying to", "61:57", "serve", "61:58", "Ivan struggle I don't think you would", "62:00", "could say like hey I don't want to eat", "62:01", "that rabbit no yeah that rabbit is the", "62:04", "way I live and then you know where it", "62:06", "spelled and that's oh yes different I", "62:09", "was writing a piece one time and I got", "62:12", "into reading about these basket weaver", "62:15", "people that were in valley of fire state", "62:16", "park in nevada which is really close to", "62:19", "vegas you should go if you've never been", "62:21", "up there basket we were yeah basket", "62:24", "basket maker or basket weaver people", "62:26", "they're like Native Americans yeah they", "62:28", "were essentially a roving band of", "62:30", "nomadic hunters yeah I can't think of", "62:33", "the year you probably could up and find", "62:34", "it but there was different generations", "62:36", "of this essentially roving band of", "62:38", "tribes and in that area the next time", "62:41", "you're in Vegas it's like an hour drive", "62:42", "north there's a bunch of petroglyphs", "62:44", "there that's a pick like deities and", "62:47", "sheep and all these different things", "62:49", "there and you could just go visit them", "62:50", "but you know what's fucked up about", "62:52", "those petroglyphs man they're not", "62:53", "protected like there's a ranch in Texas", "62:55", "that a buddy of mine went to and he's", "62:58", "like you could just go over there and", "62:59", "touch these things and they might be", "63:01", "5,000 years old I did that when my wife", "63:03", "and I went up there you could had a can", "63:05", "of spray paint they weren't shit like", "63:06", "fucked up is that it's strange it's", "63:08", "strange that you wouldn't find a way but", "63:09", "also probably you know it's probably", "63:12", "okay because it's a natural occurring", "63:14", "you know this is a natural place you", "63:15", "won't put fences up or no guard standing", "63:17", "there no it's actually pretty badass", "63:19", "that no one's fucked with it yes far", "63:21", "well and so you go up there and you see", "63:23", "these things and you're like holy crap", "63:24", "so I started reading a little bit about", "63:25", "those people and they were part of a", "63:28", "nomadic band of hunters gatherers that", "63:31", "lived in caves and essentially followed", "63:34", "desert bighorn sheep much like any of", "63:37", "the planes followed Buffalo alright so", "63:38", "they were they essentially followed", "63:40", "these things and into this valley", "63:42", "eventually the Anasazi Anasazi Indians", "63:44", "move in they start cultivating the land", "63:47", "and planting crops and you get this like", "63:49", "oh my gosh agriculture and hunting which", "63:52", "one is better what do we do and so the", "63:54", "whole story of that interaction is", "63:57", "interesting to me because it's kind of", "63:59", "the evolution of our culture right", "64:00", "hunting has created this social", "64:02", "structure ways for us to communicate", "64:04", "it's created all these things ways for", "64:06", "our body to grow and expand as we were", "64:08", "you know early humans ways for our brain", "64:12", "expand and grow and function differently", "64:14", "and then you have this like oh it's a", "64:16", "lot easier to plant crops in the ground", "64:19", "than it is to go kill a sheep right guys", "64:21", "right anybody is this easier so then you", "64:24", "get into this weird thing about what do", "64:26", "we do now you know and so I think their", "64:28", "their story was very much like the", "64:30", "Anasazi Indians they go in they", "64:34", "cultivate this area and as long as they", "64:36", "could grow crops that's what they did", "64:37", "you know and so this nomadic band of", "64:39", "hunters kind of settled in this area I'm", "64:43", "sure they still hunted to get me because", "64:45", "they have to because you can't grow the", "64:47", "whole year's worth of food for for a", "64:49", "valley like that but I think agriculture", "64:52", "kind of won out a little bit in that in", "64:54", "that scenario and as it would it's", "64:56", "easier way to live yeah evolutionary", "64:59", "what I mean the whole thing is filling", "65:01", "your belly that's the whole thing and", "65:02", "everything you know you can do to do it", "65:05", "whether it's with deer or whether it's", "65:07", "with corn or whether it's with tomatoes", "65:09", "or whatever you can grow and you know", "65:11", "you just have to eat I mean that's", "65:13", "that's the whole the whole picture is", "65:15", "staying alive back then", "65:16", "that's not our whole picture today so", "65:18", "that's where it gets really complicated", "65:19", "and that's where I think that hunters", "65:22", "have done a really good job over the", "65:24", "last X amount of years describing to", "65:27", "people like if you are going to eat meat", "65:30", "this is the most ethical the most", "65:33", "cruelty-free and the most natural way to", "65:36", "do it and you're talking about an animal", "65:38", "that literally like okay here's perfect", "65:41", "at deer that mule deer they looking at", "65:43", "written that deer had no idea I was", "65:46", "alive until it died and it died", "65:48", "instantly it was boom one shot it", "65:51", "dropped right where I shot it and that's", "65:53", "it and then it becomes steak you know", "65:56", "and it becomes delicious food that we", "65:58", "ate and that's uh that's way better than", "66:01", "any other animal that you're ever gonna", "66:03", "buy in the store I don't care if you're", "66:04", "talking about farm-raised grass-fed you", "66:07", "know locally sourced I feel like your", "66:09", "evolution as a hunter has been", "66:10", "accelerated more than most practice", "66:12", "that's how you do everything but you", "66:14", "went from when I first we first hunted", "66:16", "in British Columbia was three three", "66:18", "years ago yeah so where you are now I", "66:21", "mean you've evolved in this like what", "66:23", "you see is hunting and in our community", "66:25", "and in our", "66:25", "old and doing different things and in", "66:28", "some ways you evolved from when I was a", "66:29", "kid we just shot deer oh here's a spike", "66:31", "here's a four point she'd this deer and", "66:34", "that was a great day we dragged it off", "66:35", "and eat it and it's great", "66:36", "now I understand way more about what I", "66:40", "was doing then and what I'm doing now", "66:41", "and I think what at hunters we need to", "66:44", "be cognizant of and comfortable with is", "66:46", "you change your sensibilities change", "66:48", "over time", "66:48", "you don't become a trophy hunter you're", "66:51", "not a trophy hunter but you do", "66:52", "appreciate the difference between a", "66:54", "small and learned animal and a large one", "66:56", "as in terms of its maturity and it's how", "66:59", "awesome it is to see 380 inch elk or 200", "67:02", "inch deer you know you you your pursuit", "67:05", "is different than one was only shot that", "67:06", "moves it is also but the also part of", "67:09", "the pursuit that's different is that I", "67:10", "understand that the benefit of going", "67:12", "after mature animals is if you're", "67:14", "getting a mature deer you're talking", "67:17", "about a deer that's five years old that", "67:19", "deer has had five breeding seasons that", "67:22", "spread its genes and by killing it", "67:25", "you're gonna give a chance to the", "67:26", "younger bucks that are coming up to", "67:29", "breed so it's done its part it spread", "67:32", "its genius its created its progeny and", "67:34", "now you'll take it out about mix and", "67:36", "that's the right way to do it because", "67:38", "then you ensure a healthy herd that like", "67:41", "especially for bear that's the big", "67:43", "argument you want to take out the", "67:45", "dominant males because the dominant", "67:47", "males actually eat the cub Marauders of", "67:49", "animals that's the craziest part about", "67:51", "it is by shooting a boar you're gonna", "67:54", "save the lives of many bear yeah it's a", "67:57", "week in many ways it's kind of a", "67:59", "catch-22 because you're talking about", "68:01", "controlling population isn't it isn't it", "68:03", "catch-22 that the a younger deer tastes", "68:05", "better yeah it's so like you're out", "68:08", "there like I really love access to me", "68:09", "but to dinner when when we're over there", "68:11", "they're like we have certain call box", "68:12", "and there's certain things you want to", "68:13", "shoot it's like I really have access to", "68:15", "here and if I was out there just for", "68:16", "meat I would shot the youngest right not", "68:19", "the youngest but I would have picked a", "68:20", "certain age groups know but I'll tell", "68:21", "you here's the argument against that", "68:23", "with access deer that deer I shot was", "68:25", "not young that was a big-ass deer and", "68:27", "that fucking thing's delicious", "68:29", "like you so they're better than that", "68:31", "when they're younger I don't need that", "68:32", "it's a fact that a younger animal is", "68:34", "or tender there's a better better cut of", "68:36", "meat than an older animal for sure in", "68:38", "most cases it's not all cases yeah but", "68:41", "that's that's the general that giant elk", "68:43", "that I shot where you saw the antlers", "68:44", "they're all delicious that's amazing", "68:47", "I've been eating that thing for eight", "68:48", "months now it's fantastic yeah I do the", "68:51", "same thing but I'll kiss great no matter", "68:53", "what yeah yeah you're talking about two", "68:56", "animals that it's hard it'd be hard to", "68:58", "mess it up yeah but in general that's", "69:00", "the that's that's the hard to matter", "69:02", "right", "69:03", "since there's there's that argument", "69:04", "though you know why I don't like that", "69:05", "argument I don't mind chewy meat and I", "69:08", "like I like eating what I kill right so", "69:10", "like it feels good to me on top of it", "69:12", "tasting good like if I eat a deer that's", "69:15", "a six year old deer there's two things", "69:17", "going on there one there's a", "69:18", "satisfaction that I know the six year", "69:20", "old deer is very difficult to hunt yes", "69:22", "you know so most of the places where you", "69:24", "hunt other people are hunting as well a", "69:26", "six year old deer has seen people that", "69:28", "are hunting deer period that's right", "69:30", "so that deer is going to be on point", "69:32", "that's a tough deer to kill so that by", "69:34", "killing that deer you get extra", "69:35", "satisfaction that's one and then on to", "69:38", "you your your your your eating this", "69:41", "animal that you have this connection", "69:43", "with so it tastes good because of that", "69:44", "and I'd like I like meat that tastes", "69:48", "like me I don't want like filet mignon", "69:50", "you know I like I like a deer steak you", "69:53", "know like uh it's the best a sirloin", "69:55", "from a mule deer are better that well I", "69:58", "would say like if you took conservation", "70:01", "and organic meat right and you say I'm", "70:03", "going for I understand both those", "70:05", "principles I'm going hunting", "70:06", "everything's great you're shooting that", "70:07", "six year old mule deer right if you if", "70:09", "you remove conservation you're probably", "70:11", "not going to shoot that six year old", "70:12", "mule deer right because you're gonna get", "70:14", "a younger deer that's easier to kill", "70:15", "more 10 or more delicious turn you gotta", "70:17", "shoot that right you know our doe Garcia", "70:19", "the chef in Montana yeah he gets shit", "70:23", "from other hunters cuz he'll shoot a", "70:24", "spike on purpose look I'm here for the", "70:27", "meat guys he goes I'm grocery shopping", "70:30", "that should be in general that should be", "70:33", "ok but there's principles that say like", "70:35", "the shooting them mature animal is more", "70:37", "beneficial to the herd so that's yet", "70:40", "another complexity that we should all", "70:42", "just say like man this is here I just", "70:44", "gotta continue to talk about it that's", "70:46", "important I think what you the way you", "70:47", "approaches", "70:48", "very important because you're entirely", "70:50", "honest about the good and the bad and", "70:52", "then the bear thing you know it's like", "70:54", "it's not the best for me it's good mean", "70:56", "it's good but it's not as ELQ yeah I'm", "70:58", "not gonna stand up and be like hey", "70:59", "pussies eating the berries the best", "71:02", "thing ever it's not some people love it", "71:04", "though I don't know if they're telling", "71:05", "the truth they're telling the truth but", "71:07", "it's just I'm just I would assure them", "71:09", "if they would dabble some other meats", "71:12", "they'll find one that's better I'm", "71:13", "pretty sure well I guess it depends", "71:16", "entirely about the way to pace prepare", "71:18", "it right but the thing about there's an", "71:20", "argument for hunting bears is different", "71:22", "than the argument for hunting any other", "71:23", "animal because you do eat them and you", "71:25", "need to kill them because they don't", "71:27", "have a natural predator the problem with", "71:29", "bears is like especially if we went in", "71:31", "Alberta Jesus Christ they are everywhere", "71:34", "people who think there's a shortage of", "71:35", "bears need to go to Alberta they're", "71:38", "people that want to have one of those", "71:40", "experiences where you walk away from", "71:42", "that be like don't just do that yeah", "71:44", "they're 20 fucking bears hanging out", "71:46", "over there with Cam like I wish we get", "71:48", "can call cam cam please text in your job", "71:52", "cam poop your job cam and telling you", "71:54", "for years quit your job you're too cool", "71:56", "to have a nine-to-five", "71:56", "uh it's he's got a 7:00 to 5:00 Lord", "72:01", "takes two hours lunch to go work out and", "72:02", "run the mountains well that's savagery", "72:05", "this savagery he does pretty good for", "72:07", "half a second to five Scott damn Sam did", "72:09", "you am I gonna get my ass together he's", "72:11", "a legit savage I know well every time", "72:13", "I'm complaining about anything I think", "72:14", "about campaigns getting up at four", "72:16", "o'clock in the morning to run think", "72:18", "about that like 198th mile 205th", "72:22", "he's gonna do 234 this summer Elliot's", "72:26", "worse my dad was an ultramarathon runner", "72:27", "growing up and it just gets worse it's", "72:29", "like smoking crack oh they just get", "72:30", "deeper in water how much look around or", "72:32", "that's probably a terrible analogy but", "72:35", "jeez I'm scared of it because I keep", "72:36", "running further and further distances", "72:38", "I'm like what am i doing and I'm doing", "72:40", "it more and more often what am i doing", "72:42", "you're if you're feeling that runner's", "72:44", "high", "72:44", "well it's a little bit of that but it's", "72:46", "also like I feel improvement and I'm an", "72:47", "improvement junk ya know I can keep I'm", "72:51", "pushing further I'm going further", "72:53", "distances I feel better when I hit the", "72:55", "top of the hill yeah well my dad like", "72:57", "when I was a kid I remember my dad just", "72:59", "being you know a regular he must been", "73:01", "mid 40s maybe late 40s and he mode we", "73:05", "have like a fairly small backyard and he", "73:07", "mowed a little circle and he would go", "73:09", "out after working his jeans and his", "73:10", "loafers and like jog around the circle", "73:13", "it was very good I remember looking out", "73:15", "there being like what are you doing man", "73:17", "how big was he hard it was like maybe an", "73:19", "acre I don't know what very big he was", "73:21", "running like just little circles in this", "73:23", "yard let me get to the end of the story", "73:25", "you'll you'll get eventually but that", "73:28", "was that was his way to run right and so", "73:32", "after a while he started running you", "73:35", "know got running shoes and started to", "73:37", "get into the actual sport of running and", "73:39", "then it seems to me like three or four", "73:41", "years later he was like I think I'm", "73:43", "gonna run this 50-mile race in the", "73:45", "mountains of Maryland JFK 50-mile and", "73:47", "had he run marathons no so 50 mile races", "73:54", "like what it was not like six hours", "73:56", "seven hours I just didn't really good", "73:58", "shade or nine hours I think eight or", "74:00", "nine I think only started or maybe ten I", "74:03", "think twelve is like the cutoff one", "74:05", "interesting like eight hours for 54 for", "74:07", "a hundred it's 24 of course it is it's", "74:09", "like listen bitch my dad used to run", "74:16", "he's hunted places it was like the JK 50", "74:20", "bothers up over his Mountain it's not", "74:21", "like I remember you used to tell me", "74:23", "stories of like people falling and like", "74:25", "busting themselves all up on these rocky", "74:26", "cliff trails and he would come in and", "74:30", "this is gonna make my dad sound weird", "74:31", "he's not he's he's awesome but he would", "74:34", "like save his toenails all this time I", "74:36", "was would fall off during the race and", "74:37", "he like save them put them in a little", "74:38", "jar no save his boogers - no no just", "74:42", "toenails and he was almost like this", "74:44", "it's like I can take that right I could", "74:47", "see this thing and then he's ran 50 and", "74:49", "I think one time he ran 100 and then he", "74:51", "ran the entire C&O canal one time 183", "74:54", "miles and I was like I think it was in", "74:56", "maybe a senior in high school and I had", "74:58", "like had to drive to the checkpoints and", "75:00", "like give him food and stuff so he never", "75:02", "started until using this 40s guy maybe", "75:05", "fifties it was 40 s probably I would say", "75:08", "yeah later did he keep does he still do", "75:11", "it how old you know he would still do it", "75:12", "if his knees would allow him to he's", "75:13", "mid-60s and a sixth", "75:15", "he fucked up but he's still he's he'll", "75:17", "still bike and he'll still he hikes all", "75:19", "the time now so he still has that like", "75:21", "need to push push and and he all in like", "75:25", "when he gets around one of his buddies", "75:27", "in particular that they ran together", "75:28", "they're like old army buddies and", "75:30", "talking about this like experience that", "75:32", "they shared together like maybe that one", "75:34", "time a mau mau 94 when you trip and fail", "75:37", "and and that it's just like they're", "75:39", "telling old war stories it's like that's", "75:41", "this visceral thing that they share it's", "75:43", "really cool he did it past I mean maybe", "75:47", "it's a midlife crisis man I don't know", "75:48", "but yeah he wasn't predisposed to run", "75:52", "100 miles until he decided that he", "75:54", "wanted to yeah it's weird right that", "75:58", "that compulsion is a very odd one that", "76:01", "the need for suffering like cams got it", "76:04", "bad it becomes a thing yeah he's got it", "76:07", "bad in a weird way my dad like he got a", "76:09", "knee surgery and then like well they", "76:11", "said it was ACL I think it was right it", "76:13", "was the scope of his knee get an Easter", "76:15", "scope scope it's an easy one so what it", "76:17", "they cut his knee open remember what I",
