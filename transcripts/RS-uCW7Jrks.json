at", "42:51", "this point and this is why I always say", "42:52", "at this point in our scientific", "42:54", "knowledge because scientific knowledge", "42:55", "can evolve and we can learn new things", "42:56", "you know at one point the thing that", "42:58", "started off the whole gluten trend was a", "43:01", "kind of poorly poorly designed study", "43:04", "where they had a small sample size of", "43:06", "people and they designed it just to test", "43:08", "you know gluten versus an on a diet", "43:10", "without gluten and they came to the", "43:12", "conclusion that about 20% of people just", "43:15", "based on this very small study had a bad", "43:17", "reaction to gluten now and well and", "43:20", "these people came in saying they had", "43:22", "stomach problems now these people it", "43:25", "turned out they looked at it and said", "43:27", "there's no there's no afterward as a", "43:28", "scientist all sat back and said why", "43:30", "we're only about 1% of people having", "43:33", "celiac disease and then all of a sudden", "43:34", "20% of people are running around like", "43:36", "glutens making their dick flies a fly", "43:38", "off this is there's something up here so", "43:40", "they made a better design study and they", "43:43", "took out common cot they did you know", "43:44", "kind of double blind did a better design", "43:47", "study to say we're going to take out all", "43:48", "these other causes of gastrointestinal", "43:51", "distress and we're going to try to make", "43:52", "this double-blind and they figured out", "43:54", "it was the

closer to between like one at", "44:04", "about five percent of people that were", "44:05", "having any issues with gluten now the", "44:08", "problem is that what was causing that", "44:10", "though the the gastrointestinal stress", "44:12", "and the in the one to five percent yeah", "44:14", "so one percent is celiac disease for", "44:16", "sure one percent yes", "44:18", "what is across the board with people 1%", "44:20", "it is that is fairly high now here's the", "44:23", "thing that that higher percent of people", "44:25", "that 2 to 5 here's the question now", "44:27", "they're still trying to figure out why", "44:29", "some people seem to have an issue with", "44:31", "gluten now I could be wrong on this is", "44:33", "just off the top of my head what I", "44:34", "remember from a study but I've had to", "44:36", "cite it a few times so I think my", "44:37", "knowledge is accurate", "44:39", "feel free to fact check me out at home", "44:41", "but the thing with those extra percent", "44:44", "they're trying to figure out why they", "44:46", "might have an issue with gluten because", "44:48", "they you know like wheat is you know you", "44:50", "think of it as a carb heavy thing right", "44:52", "and gluten is a protein so that other", "44:55", "few percentage of people they're trying", "44:57", "to figure out why the gluten does it", "44:59", "because gluten is in a few other things", "45:00", "it's in barley and rye so what they've", "45:04", "figured out is that or this is the going", "45:06", "theory right now gluten can cause a", "45:10", "small reaction in the stomach where you", "45:13", "produce this protein called zon Yulin", "45:15", "that can cause an increase in", "45:16", "inflammation this seems to be and this", "45:18", "is what I this has only been one study", "45:20", "that I've read on it it seems to be", "45:22", "relatively new they're still looking", "45:23", "into it so there's a chance that people", "45:25", "might be in the 2 to 5 percent that", "45:27", "can't handle it because of that it could", "45:29", "be another component of the wheat barley", "45:31", "rye that's causing it but gluten in and", "45:35", "of itself it's not you know it's unless", "45:37", "you are one of those people has an", "45:40", "actual reaction to it perfectly fine go", "45:42", "on to have you know go have a sandwich", "45:44", "so but yeah if you want one but if you", "45:47", "want one yeah I you know I cut back my", "45:49", "carbs pretty heavily over the last", "45:51", "couple of years and I've had really good", "45:53", "results well it's I mean if you're", "45:54", "someone who's trying to build muscle you", "45:56", "know is that I just think that just just", "45:58", "it eventually it becomes too much sugar", "46:00", "it so much sugar in your body if you're", "46:01", "eating a lot and Rebecca we need to have", "46:03", "that food pyramid and the bottom of the", "46:05", "food pyramid was all breads yes I mean", "46:07", "you know I mean that's it's kind of", "46:08", "interesting because that's like still in", "46:09", "like dr.

"46:31", "part I think", "46:31", "are a few things that are going on with", "46:33", "it one is that we're really bad at", "46:34", "counting calories and we we were", "46:36", "chit-chatting a

the fuck they're talking about", "56:48", "because there's a lot of doctors you get", "56:50", "injured they're like we got to stop", "56:51", "doing anything it's it's a thing where", "56:53", "it's like Eller stainless is a weirdo", "56:54", "disorder like you're basically your", "56:56", "collagen is not able to heal itself or", "56:59", "stay kind of in shape as it used to or", "57:02", "it's

think if somebody's like bending", "58:20", "over and touching their back of their", "58:22", "head under their feet I think the reason", "58:24", "is because they know how flexible I", "58:26",

know about there is", "73:55", "a great graph on on this showing how", "73:59", "less toxic it is then the then the", "74:01", "pesticides it replaced because we", "74:02", "weren't we didn't go from using no", "74:03", "pesticide to using roundup and I know", "74:06", "someone's gonna correct me saying it's", "74:07", "an herbicide but on herbicide is", "74:09", "pesticides the blanket term for all", "74:11", "things that kill stuff in farming so", "74:14", "before before roundup I believe the one", "74:19", "we used was sigh Anna's eeen I could be", "74:20", "wrong on this but the one we used before", "74:23", "roundup was in terms of the ld50 the", "74:25", "lethal dose for about 50% of the", "74:27", "population it was 10 times higher than", "74:29", "roundup and now we barely sell

that's a question that", "74:43", "that people are you know keep coming", "74:45", "back to and part of the reason that", "74:46", "people are suspicious of it is because", "74:48", "of its use with a

like they've tested to see if it", "74:59", "if it accumulates in breast milk it does", "75:01", "not they tested to see it because cancer", "75:04", "doesn't seem to and they've tried", "75:07",
