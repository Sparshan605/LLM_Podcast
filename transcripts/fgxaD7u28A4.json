all the shootings in Chicago in", "08:48", "it's fucking bonkers I mean just look at", "08:51", "what just happened", "08:52", "Father's Day I think it was like a", "08:54", "hundred and two people shot yeah yeah", "08:56", "fucking ridiculous fucking crazy and but", "08:59", "here's his thing about that too there's", "09:00", "there's a consistency in a pattern", "09:02", "behind these types of shootings it's not", "09:04", "even like so usually when you deal with", "09:06", "a problem the first thing you do is you", "09:08", "try to look for a pattern to see if you", "09:09", "can figure it figure out a pattern so", "09:10", "you try to solve it yeah and you see", "09:12", "okay what's the common denominator of", "09:14", "all these things and then why is it you", "09:16", "can figure out start to figure out why", "09:17", "it happens the idea that we're gonna", "09:19", "create laws that's gonna stop something", "09:21", "that's so centralized in it and it's so", "09:24", "it's it's there's a fundamental cause", "09:27", "for the types of violence that we're", "09:29", "talking about right now because they're", "09:30", "happening in very specific areas of our", "09:32", "country this isn't widespread right it's", "09:34", "not like it's like we just have this", "09:35", "mass violence across the country on the", "09:38", "contrary violence and violent crime is", "09:40", "actually going down if you look at it", "09:41", "from a statistical standard however", "09:43", "there are very little pockets within our", "09:45", "country that had this violence and", "09:48", "there's consistencies within that pocket", "09:50", "one of the big ones being done lost no", "09:53", "gun laws extreme poverty okay you know", "09:57", "what I'm saying it is our inner cities", "09:59", "because if you think about it it some", "10:02", "people like to even place it based on", "10:05", "race right and they'd say okay well this", "10:07", "is a black on black violence issue yeah", "10:11", "I can understand that", "10:11", "however if you really think about it", "10:13", "think about some of the most affluent", "10:15", "black neighborhoods in the country we", "10:17", "don't have those problems right so with", "10:19", "poverty exactly and it's also an issue", "10:22", "of in Chicago in particular I took a", "10:26", "ride once I had a guy was driving us was", "10:29", "a former cop and he was saying that they", "10:32", "arrested a bunch of the high level drug", "10:34", "dealers and they created a power vacuum", "10:36", "and then it started this crazy war and", "10:39", "then this war is just and he's like no", "10:41", "one knows how to get out of it no one", "10:43", "knows what to do about it this is why", "10:44", "Southside Chicago to this day is one of", "10:47", "the scariest spots in this entire", "10:49", "country I've done too when I was with", "10:51", "the NRA I did two episodes in South Side", "10:53", "Chicago are you not what the NRA name no", "10:55", "no I'm not how come they're the NRA and", "10:58", "their ad agency of record had a falling", "11:00", "out", "11:00", "massive falling out I was basically", "11:03", "collateral damage within that so for", "11:06", "whatever reason after the falling out I", "11:08", "haven't had contact with the NRA for", "11:09", "almost a year so were you working for", "11:12", "them I pretty much in terms of as much", "11:17", "as say Don Lemon works for CNN okay", "11:20", "human really works for CNN they give him", "11:22", "a fat check well I don't get down limit", "11:25", "I didn't wasn't getting done with money", "11:26", "but essentially what I was doing was I", "11:28", "was a commentator and I was a host of", "11:30", "mush of two shows on a platform okay", "11:32", "that's the D still a lot of people", "11:34", "thought I wasn't actually still a member", "11:35", "of the NRA", "11:36", "yeah I'm still remember that right yeah", "11:37", "okay I thought maybe I had a falling out", "11:40", "with the way the organization was wrong", "11:41", "no no that it's just radio silence right", "11:44", "on there yeah I I the way I function I", "11:49", "just keep I just keep moving that's what", "11:50", "I do", "11:51", "smart yeah so from that perspective so", "11:54", "there's no on my part there's no there's", "11:56", "no bad blood I may have some critiques", "11:58", "about certain things by than that", "11:59", "there's no bad blood", "12:00", "um have you noticed a big uptick in", "12:04", "people interested in your message yes", "12:06", "yeah yeah especial out of people who are", "12:09", "buying guns for the first time like I'm", "12:10", "pretty sure you're getting - yeah a lot", "12:13", "of people asking if they can borrow a", "12:15", "gun yeah and then they get a first", "12:17", "course lesson about how the laws work", "12:19", "yeah and also like people in California", "12:21", "that wanted to go buy a gun then", "12:23", "realized it takes a long time like gives", "12:25", "you a background check there's a wait", "12:27", "period and a funny thing that used to", "12:28", "get the biggest push back from my", "12:30", "defense of not having a waiting period", "12:33", "for firearms I usually get I used to get", "12:36", "a lot of pushback from that people are", "12:37", "like well Lisa Gill gives people time to", "12:39", "calm down and cool off I mean that's", "12:41", "that's that's cartoon land thinking", "12:43", "somebody who's made a decision to kill", "12:45", "somebody they're going to kill them or", "12:47", "at least gonna make an attempt to do so", "12:49", "maybe the idea that that somehow not", "12:52", "being able to buy a gun immediately to", "12:54", "to commit that crime I personally don't", "12:57", "think it does anything I don't I think", "13:00", "if I've set out to commit some crime", "13:02", "against someone and I go try to get a", "13:03", "gun and I can't get a gun I'm gonna try", "13:05", "to find another Avenue by which to get", "13:07", "that tool that I need to commit that", "13:08", "crime hmm and so I ever on in the", "13:12", "alternative I can tell you", "13:14", "actual stories about people trying to", "13:17", "get firearms who needed them immediately", "13:19", "but couldn't get them and thus probably", "13:23", "died as a result of it and so and I and", "13:26", "I know other people people like I've had", "13:28", "help I've had girlfriends in the past", "13:29", "who I've dealt with situations with", "13:30", "stalkers who would like okay I need I", "13:33", "need a gun for tonight because this", "13:34", "person showed up at my house right you", "13:36", "know things like that don't you think", "13:38", "that in order to safely that you you", "13:42", "want to make sure that someone is not a", "13:44", "dangerous violent felon before you sell", "13:46", "them a gun absolutely so there's got to", "13:49", "be some kind of background check mm-hmm", "13:50", "we and we have them right yeah but how", "13:52", "long do you think you don't want to wait", "13:54", "period no I'm against the wait period", "13:56", "and what is the so the logic is if like", "13:59", "say if a woman knows that a guy is", "14:01", "stalking her and might show up at her", "14:03", "house tonight she wants to be able to", "14:04", "have a gun absolutely", "14:06", "that makes sense did it hmm but there's", "14:08", "still gonna be a background check on", "14:10", "that girl yes so so if she were to so", "14:12", "let's let's kind of flush that out okay", "14:14", "so right now if you go and buy a gun", "14:16", "from a dealer right someone who has a", "14:18", "license to sell firearms as a business", "14:21", "you have to have a background check", "14:22", "right in the background checks instant", "14:24", "but I think a lot of people misconstrue", "14:26", "the the fact that the background check", "14:28", "is instant as being insufficient okay", "14:30", "and that's not the case it's just that", "14:32", "we live in a technical you know we have", "14:33", "technology now it allows us to conduct a", "14:36", "background check a lot quicker than we", "14:37", "probably would thirty forty years yeah I", "14:39", "bought my first gun in 94 and the", "14:42", "background check is like by pony it took", "14:49", "a while it's a lot of paperwork did it", "14:51", "make sure you're not a criminal but they", "14:52", "you know there was no internet yeah", "14:54", "exactly yeah and so now with the", "14:56", "internet I mean it's it's pretty pretty", "14:58", "quick yeah I think what people are", "15:01", "having a problem with is the private", "15:02", "transactions right right and so", "15:05", "generally speaking in most states you", "15:07", "don't you're not required to force", "15:09", "someone to get a background check if you", "15:10", "were gonna sell them a gun like if", "15:12", "you're in the business of selling guns", "15:13", "then that's one thing but if you're like", "15:14", "hey Joe you want a gun and say you want", "15:17", "to tell you you saw one of my guns and", "15:18", "you're like I want to buy that gun right", "15:20", "in Texas I can I can meet meet with you", "15:23", "as long as I know you're not a felon or", "15:24", "have a reason to know that you're a", "15:25", "felon or prohibit a person of some sort", "15:28", "can sell you the gun so you don't have", "15:30", "to do any kind of track no that's", "15:32", "interesting now I'm at liberty to say", "15:36", "hey Joe how about you meet me at this", "15:38", "gun store and pay for a background check", "15:40", "on top of the price of the gun and then", "15:42", "have a back and then conduct

background", "85:23", "check aspect of it where he kind of", "85:25", "talked about it from the standpoint of", "85:26", "the waiting period the the questionnaire", "85:29", "that you filled out in the beginning", "85:30", "before you submit yourself or the", "85:32", "background check that that was the", "85:33", "background check and it wasn't and so", "85:36", "because a lot of people think that a lot", "85:38", "of people think that I'll you just go", "85:39", "there fill out a yes or no question yes", "85:42", "or no question here about whether or not", "85:44", "you can own a gun and then you get a gun", "85:46", "and that's not the case", "85:47", "and so I corrected that and then also", "85:50", "what I did I just critique", "85:51", "his position on a couple of things like", "85:53", "for instance high-capacity magazines", "85:55", "because he says he's like you don't need", "85:56", "50 rounds in a clip so to speak", "85:58", "hmm well it's actually a magazine but", "86:00", "that's neither here nor there but I", "86:02", "disagree with that now in that regard", "86:05", "he's not wrong that's his opinion my", "86:08", "opinion is I think I do need a magazine", "86:11", "it has 50 rounds and then I went on to", "86:12", "explain why would you say you want to", "86:15", "kill 50 people", "86:16", "no so so with respect so why do we own", "86:22", "firearms well we own firearms a lot of", "86:24", "people on our only fire for self-defense", "86:26", "right and as a regular person I'm not a", "86:28", "criminal I just go about my day I don't", "86:31",

"86:47", "all of the restraints that come with", "86:48", "what loss so if there's a law that says", "86:52", "you can't have more than 10 rounds in", "86:53", "like here in California right I can't", "86:55", "have a magazine that has more than ten", "86:57", "rounds if I'm a criminal and I know I'm", "86:59", "gonna commit a crime do I really give a", "87:01", "damn about the law says I can't come I", "87:02", "can't carry ten rounds of my magazine", "87:03", "right I don't however as a citizen when", "87:07", "I'm going about my life carrying a gun", "87:09", "on me is hard enough right and because", "87:12", "like you know there's hope there's whole", "87:13", "dialogs about what size gun you can have", "87:16", "how many rounds you want to have what", "87:17", "bullet caliber things of that nature I", "87:19", "don't know what I'm gonna face I could", "87:22", "face one guy I can taste one guy who's", "87:24", "high as hell I can face two three four", "87:27", "or five

I think smarten me in fact", "87:50", "well no go ahead what the argument is is", "87:53", "if they're looking at it from a mass", "87:54", "shooter perspective right they're saying", "87:56", "if you limit the amount of bullets at", "87:58", "the mass you can have that half more", "87:59", "change clubs yeah but again he's going", "88:02", "out to commit mass murder", "88:05", "he cares about breaking the law that", "88:06", "says he can only have ten rounds in his", "88:07", "magazine I think they're ideas that it", "88:09", "makes it harder for him to get those", "88:11", "clips because he can't get them at the", "88:13", "local gun store no more those out there", "88:14", "than guns and we have over 300 million", "88:16", "guns in this country right see they're", "88:18", "gonna have them but you know with a lot", "88:20", "of these mass shooters here's the other", "88:21", "problem they're actually getting the", "88:23", "guns illegally they're getting them from", "88:25", "someone though they're stealing them", "88:27", "from someone's gun safe or from", "88:28", "someone's house yeah that's what a lot", "88:30", "of it is coming from anyway I think what", "88:32", "a lot I think a lot of be the kind of", "88:34", "project not so much to politicians I", "88:35", "think the politicians are buying large", "88:37", "very disingenuous but a lot of people", "88:38", "who support these ideas who are just", "88:40", "regular people I think that it's their", "88:42", "way of trying to figure out some way of", "88:43", "control because because mass shootings", "88:46", "terrifies because they're so random like", "88:47", "they're like tornadoes see hurricanes", "88:49", "you can kind of prepare for a hurricane", "88:51", "you kind of have an idea of where the", "88:52", "path is coming where it's going", "88:53", "tornadoes they just touch down and", "88:55", "destroy shit right and you don't know", "88:57", "where it's coming same thing with mass", "88:59", "shootings mass shootings are terrifying", "89:02", "because they just kind of happen out of", "89:03", "nowhere it's like whoa okay what can we", "89:05", "do cuz you feel helpless you really feel", "89:07", "helpless and even though they account", "89:09", "for almost a statistical zero of gun of", "89:12", "gun violence in this country they still", "89:14", "terrifies because we don't know when or", "89:16", "where it's gonna happen see the other", "89:17", "gun violence stuff doesn't really", "89:18", "terrifies as much because we know where", "89:20", "it happens right happens in their cities", "89:22", "don't go to any city but mass shootings", "89:26", "terrifies from that stands because we", "89:28", "don't know when it's going to come so we", "89:30", "think okay well if we we limit this and", "89:32", "we restrict this then then it'll", "89:34", "minimize it even more that's like no", "89:36", "it's not gonna happen we have to deal", "89:38", "with the reality and the reality", "89:39", "terrifies me just as much as anyone else", "89:41", "but what are you gonna do I'm gonna lay", "89:43", "down and die no you fight yeah", "89:46", "and that and that's it and now I'm when", "89:48", "I was on Bill Maher and we talked about", "89:49", "arming teachers right the idea of arming", "89:51", "teachers and he was like I was like well", "89:54", "if

that's not and and I think a", "90:27", "misconception to was I was like a lot of", "90:29", "people thought I was saying we need to", "90:31", "mandate that teachers own firearms", "90:32", "that's

problem an audience", "90:54", "yeah yeah no you do shit for class", "90:56", "because their teach now in all fairness", "91:00", "during the conversation he poked any", "91:03", "product and I think he gave me more of a", "91:05", "fair shot than anybody else yeah he is", "91:09", "now when I went to the when I went to", "91:11", "the roundtable discussion I was a", "91:12", "different story and part of it was I", "91:15", "thought I could approach it rationally", "91:18", "yeah and I couldn't because all the", "91:20", "person that I was dealing with was doing", "91:22", "was appealing to

you gonna enforce them", "91:30", "and they're like and she would just kind", "91:33", "of stutter and stammer but then it like", "91:35", "she'd uh Bill Moore posted a picture of", "91:38", "a guy

probably say", "92:19", "oh yeah you still gotta like walk away", "92:21", "with a lot of questions and maybe not", "92:22", "even really coming up with any solution", "92:25", "and most likely now

people but now they've even", "100:44", "what they'll do is they'll try to", "100:45", "invalidate that argument if I could put", "100:48", "them into people problem and they'll try", "100:49", "to and they'll try to undermine it by", "100:50", "acting like it's just a stupid trope", "100:52", "yeah but it's truth well I made a tweet", "100:54", "a long time ago I said this country as a",

"101:20", "gets looked at very closely and the", "101:22", "other gets belatedly ignore why do you", "101:24", "think that is because the pharmaceutical", "101:26", "industry", "101:27", "a shitload

"101:52", "medication imagine if that becomes the", "101:55", "narrative in the news yeah like that", "101:57", "people on SSRIs are fuckin dangerous", "101:59", "because all these school shooters are on", "102:01", "SSRIs now see that but hold on because", "102:04", "that would almost be a better argument", "102:07", "than the NRA because if you look at the", "102:10", "NRA and you look at NRA members and the", "102:13", "the amount of NRA members that have", "102:15", "actually done these horrible mass", "102:18", "shootings it's like none yeah it's crazy", "102:22", "that the medication is a better", "102:25", "correlation than the NRA likes saying", "102:29", "that I'm just I'm just saying the facts", "102:38", "responsible gun owners are not the", "102:41", "people that are doing these things", "102:42", "it's crazy people and unfortunately", "102:44", "crazy people are oftentimes on", "102:45", "medication yeah now there's that that's", "102:47", "like a correlation causation argument as", "102:49", "well I'm not saying that the medication", "102:51", "is forcing these people into doing that", "102:53", "but I am saying that I have known people", "102:55", "that have taken SSRIs and they've taken", "102:57", "antidepressants and a lot of different", "102:59", "psycho psycho psycho tropic medicines", "103:01", "and one of the things that they've said", "103:02", "is that it makes them not care about", "103:04", "things it's real weird stuff can happen", "103:06", "it's like it's a it disassociates them", "103:09", "from emotions and and things don't", "103:13", "bother them I mean that that's scary", "103:15", "that scary to me because I'm I am the", "103:18", "total opposite I feel everything I mean", "103:22", "I really do I'm a very sensitive person", "103:24", "I know how to handle it mm-hm but I'm", "103:26", "very sensitive and it could speak to the", "103:27", "notion any when you hear people describe", "103:29", "the account of interacting with a mass", "103:32", "shooter yes them having this kind of", "103:34", "stoic replies yeah shark eyes yeah yeah", "103:37", "they're all on medication man", "103:40", "I mean it's it's really like the numbers", "103:42", "are staggering", "103:43", "and I'm not saying medication causes", "103:45", "people yeah I mean it's something it's", "103:47", "something that we need that needs to be", "103:48", "talked about", "103:48", "it doesn't explored like I said on the", "103:51", "board of walk to talk America which is a", "103:54", "mental health to a mental health", "103:57", "organization and and whose goal", "103:59", "basically is to address the correlation", "104:02", "if a New York between firearm ownership", "104:05", "in mental health and is this something", "104:07", "you got involved because of the attacks", "104:09", "on gun ownership and the recognition", "104:11", "that there is some solution so the", "104:13", "catalyst for it was to say cuz a lot of", "104:15", "gun owners will say well it's a mental", "104:17", "health issue", "104:18", "and we'll always say that you and I", "104:20", "agree we do believe that is the case so", "104:22", "what Walter talked America does is it", "104:24", "says okay so let's walk the talk let's", "104:26", "try to figure out how to fix or deal", "104:28", "with the mental health issue component", "104:30", "right if we're gonna say that's what it", "104:32", "is and it's not the gun and we do", "104:33", "believe that so let's start having that", "104:35", "conversation and doing what needs to do", "104:37", "so what the with the probe with the", "104:39", "organization does is it it crosses the", "104:40", "aisle with people in the mental health", "104:42", "space and brings them over into the gun", "104:44", "side and vice versa and so we can have", "104:46", "those conversations to figure out a way", "104:47", "how we can kind of balance the armed the", "104:50", "firearm ownership with mental health", "104:52", "because that conversation is not being", "104:54", "had right and so I think if we're gonna", "104:56", "talk about it and say that it's a mental", "104:58", "health issue okay so let's let's start", "104:59", "this deep sea dive into the mental", "105:01", "health issue and see if we can come up", "105:02", "with a solution that that speaks to why", "105:04", "we have so many people that have these", "105:06", "mental health issues and then how do we", "105:08", "exist in a world where this many people", "105:10", "have mental health issues in a world", "105:12", "also where we have this many guns yeah", "105:14", "and so so that we can better solve", "105:16", "whatever problems we think we have", "105:18", "instead of just stalling around well we", "105:20", "need to ban this we need to come with", "105:21", "stupid law like instead of doing that I", "105:24", "don't think it's that simple yeah I", "105:27", "don't think it's as simple as banning", "105:28", "things because I think there's a lot of", "105:29", "people that are responsible gun your gun", "105:31", "users and gun owners and I don't think", "105:34", "you should do anything to take away", "105:35", "their rights yeah I really don't I", "105:37", "didn't and I get in arguments with", "105:39", "people about that particularly my", "105:40", "liberal friends yeah you know they're", "105:42", "like how can you call yourself a liberal", "105:44", "when you have those that perspective I'm", "105:45", "like because it's rational I don't", "105:47", "understand why the gun debate he's even", "105:50", "politicized it should not be it", "105:52", "shouldn't be political the fact that", "105:53", "things division between like the fact", "105:56", "that you can't be a liberal and and in", "105:57", "pro gun it's facing the same way that", "105:59", "like I can't be like the idea of being", "106:01", "conservative in pro-gun is seen as a", "106:03", "crazy thing that doesn't make any sense", "106:04", "to me either", "106:05", "I think the gun should live in a space", "106:07", "that is it's it's outside of the idea of", "106:10", "politics within reason of course because", "106:12", "you know there's always going to be", "106:13", "everything politics is kind of", "106:14", "everything right but I don't think it", "106:17", "should be that defensive divisive Lee", "106:20", "defined between being a liberal or", "106:22", "conservative yeah", "106:24", "it's just so weird to me for divisive", "106:26", "about everything I mean there's there's", "106:28", "certain topics like here's a good one", "106:31", "global warming like I guarantee you man", "106:34", "is global if you had across the board", "106:36", "how much of climate change is natural", "106:40", "versus how much of it is man-made and", "106:42", "you just just a simple question and you", "106:44", "threw that out there I guarantee if you", "106:47", "looked at the numbers and you could get", "106:49", "a real accurate assessment of how many", "106:51", "conservatives and how many liberals", "106:52", "responded mm-hmm and I think that if you", "106:54", "said is it a hoax on you and you went to", "106:56", "the the yeah side yes it's a hoax it's", "106:59", "overwhelmingly conservative people who", "107:00", "think it's a hoax or that it's not nice", "107:03", "I think the reason for that to a degree", "107:05", "is because you have so many PPF you have", "107:07", "very very out front figure heads who've", "107:11", "tried to utilize global climate change", "107:14", "as a way to kind of undermine the", "107:16", "economic structure in this country", "107:18", "like you know if the Green Power and all", "107:20", "this stuff like that like look at the", "107:22", "Green Deal to me that's just economics", "107:25", "version it's just trying to entirely", "107:27", "change the economic structure of our", "107:29", "country look at me moving on so the new", "107:31", "Green Deal for people don't know what it", "107:32", "means like what they're trying to do but", "107:34", "as far as the really basically trying to", "107:35", "try and replace all of our kind of", "107:37", "conservative means of production with", "107:39", "respect to energy and replace it with", "107:41", "green energy and and I don't think it's", "107:44", "I don't think it's completely", "107:45", "sustainable and it's not even like it's", "107:46", "progressive it's a complete turnaround", "107:48", "180 and I just think that's", "107:50", "irresponsible now here's the thing about", "107:52", "that from my standpoint right now I", "107:56", "consider myself just right-of-center", "107:57", "as far as ideology I have not done", "108:01", "enough research on climate change", "108:05", "to have a definitive opinion about it so", "108:09", "what I'm telling you is what I'm seeing", "108:10", "other people say and that's why I think", "108:13", "there are a lot of people on the", "108:14", "conservative aspect of it that are like", "108:16", "it's a hoax because they see it as basic", "108:18", "economics inversion now as far as", "108:21", "climate changing it of itself", "108:22", "I don't know I'm probably the last", "108:25", "person to talk to about that because I", "108:26", "like my cars to destroy the environment", "108:29", "have you

with", "167:27", "subsonic so that's the only one where it", "167:30", "actually gets really damn quiet but the", "167:33", "problem is is unless you're shooting a", "167:35", "bolt-action the sound of that bolt", "167:37", "smacking back and forth it's loud as", "167:39", "hell too but what about a pistol same", "167:42", "thing cuz yeah you get you get the sound", "167:45", "of the other slide

sir with subsonic rounds", "167:54", "the opposite of a suppressor is a muzzle", "167:56", "break and I have a rifle with a muzzle", "167:58", "break yeah I think it mitigates the kick", "168:00", "yeah but it also oh it's so loud mad", "168:04", "yeah because you got cuz you're you're", "168:06", "outside of the cone of the blast right", "168:08", "and so everybody on the side of you it's", "168:10", "getting it's nice man there really makes", "168:14", "shooting a gun so much more enjoyable", "168:16", "yeah it's like 50% less recoil yeah yeah", "168:19", "really feels like so it's like either", "168:21", "one pressors do the same thing surprise", "168:24", "mitigate the recoil to so okay so you", "168:25", "can go suppressor or you can go now and", "168:28", "I tell people all the time the whole", "168:29", "suppressor thing I think that's a that's", "168:31", "a health issue I think so too I think", "168:34", "it's a healthy for your ears yeah yeah", "168:36", "like it's loud man like we don't really", "168:37", "have this ignorant idea that people are", "168:40", "gonna sneak up on people shooting no", "168:41", "one's gonna hear anything", "168:42", "you mean the same way people do with", "168:43", "knives yeah but I mean they think it's", "168:49", "gonna be like the movies yeah it doesn't", "168:51", "happen like that now it's not it's like", "168:54", "I told you like I don't shoot when I", "168:56", "shoot suppressed", "168:57", "I still wear ear protection oh yeah like", "168:59", "people realize that like people in my", "169:01", "videos like why are you wearing ear", "169:02", "protection", "169:02", "you're allowed they hunt with", "169:04", "suppressors and they do it out of", "169:06", "courtesy to the other people yeah yeah I", "169:08",
