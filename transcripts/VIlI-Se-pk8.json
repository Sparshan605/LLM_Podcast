yeah and", "04:12", "that was a rough three week period and", "04:15", "so so it's you know encourage the debate", "04:18", "and the battle of ideas so to speak and", "04:20", "all of this stuff until

YouTube has always", "04:33", "been a secondary thought for me the the", "04:35", "first thought was the audio version of", "04:37", "the podcast and in fact when we were", "04:40", "uploading it to YouTube at first I was", "04:42", "like why are we even doing this I guess", "04:43", "why not some people probably want to", "04:45", "watch it and then somewhere along the", "04:47", "line it became at least close to as big", "04:51", "as the audio version of it and then", "04:53", "maybe even more significant because one", "04:58", "of the things that the YouTube version", "04:59", "has is the comment section which is", "05:00", "often a fucking dumpster fire but it at", "05:04", "least there is some sort of like a", "05:06", "community engagement aspect of it that", "05:08", "doesn't really exist in iTunes so I can", "05:10", "in iTunes it's sort of it's in a vacuum", "05:12", "right sure but when the ad pocalypse", "05:16", "thing happened I was like hmmm what was", "05:18", "going on here", "05:19", "it wasn't it wasn't my primary focus so", "05:21", "it wasn't terrifying but people that", "05:23", "only did YouTube and people that relied", "05:27", "on that for their living I mean it's a", "05:28", "huge blow it was huge and at the time", "05:30", "I'm trying to think back I think maybe", "05:33", "like around 30% of my entire shows", "05:36", "revenue was coming from YouTube at the", "05:37", "time so it was not everything but it was", "05:41", "still significant right I mean I have", "05:42", "staff and overhead and all of that stuff", "05:44", "so just overnight 30% going away is huge", "05:47", "and that's why I've tried to move to the", "05:49", "model of telling my audience you can", "05:51", "skip all of this stuff you know even", "05:53", "some of these other you know super chats", "05:56", "and all of this other stuff like we run", "05:58", "a membership program on my website I", "06:00", "control a hundred percent of it so it's", "06:01",

when", "06:36", "it goes from I am fighting white", "06:38", "supremacist content", "06:40", "- an algorithm can't distinguish between", "06:42", "that and white-supremacist Khan oh", "06:45", "that's bad for me yeah right when I", "06:47", "interview Richard Spencer mmm I", "06:49", "obviously don't agree with Richard", "06:51", "Spencer but can an algorithm figure out", "06:54", "that there's a difference between an", "06:56", "interview I do with Richard Spencer and", "06:58", "white nationalist propaganda I don't", "07:00", "know but we can kind of get around all", "07:02", "that if you just go directly to me and", "07:05", "that's why my focus has been growing", "07:06", "that those direct did you interview", "07:08", "Richard Spencer yeah did you get shit", "07:10", "for that yes yeah that's a weird one", "07:13", "right and you know um I'm sure you're", "07:15", "aware that uh that what is it called the", "07:18", "date in society that the Kin whether", "07:21", "there was a woman who made a bunch of", "07:23", "connections like Joe Rogan knows David", "07:25", "pac-man and Joe Rogan also knows Alex", "07:28", "Jones Alex Jones must be friends with", "07:29", "David Pakman like the man yeah it's like", "07:31", "one of those minds you know like let's", "07:33", "and it was really weird", "07:35", "it's like guilt by association I saw a", "07:38", "couple of them there was like an initial", "07:40", "one which means you're thinking of then", "07:41", "there was a map of like the YouTube", "07:43", "sphere specifically yeah yeah yeah and", "07:46", "this idea that everyone's like a part of", "07:49", "a grand conspiracy to help each other", "07:50", "out and push right ideology even though", "07:53", "you know a lot of people that were", "07:55", "labeled as right or aren't right like", "07:57", "who like me oh I'm not right at all my", "08:01", "sense is your politics are pretty left", "08:04", "on most stuff although I don't I mean I", "08:08", "don't know you personally beyond just", "08:09", "seeing your shows", "08:11", "but maybe the critique is based on", "08:13", "because I think that those maps were", "08:15", "based on what is the YouTube algorithm", "08:17", "suggesting mm-hmm and so that may not be", "08:20", "in line with your personal politics", "08:22", "right it's just maybe what we're talking", "08:23", "about", "08:24", "like if you're interested in conflict if", "08:26", "you're trying to get engagement that", "08:28", "that's the way to do it like you know if", "08:29", "you to out YouTube algorithm is", "08:31", "constantly suggesting people like Ben", "08:33", "Shapiro or having McGinnis or whatever", "08:35", "and those videos come up over and over", "08:36", "again sure and I mean so a lot of those", "08:39", "people's channels do really well on", "08:41", "YouTube so if you interview someone who", "08:45", "has a channel themselves there's a very", "08:47", "good chance that the algorithm if", "08:48", "they're watching your interview with", "08:49", "that person will say well here's a lot", "08:51", "of their stuff", "08:52", "and then once you click there the the", "08:55", "algorithm very quickly starts to build a", "08:56", "picture of every individual user mm-hmm", "08:59", "if you watch your interview with ben", "09:00", "shapiro and then it takes you to a daily", "09:02", "wire video right then it takes you like", "09:04", "the daily wire second-stringer guy and", "09:06", "then you're off who knows where right", "09:09", "that's it's all machine learning right I", "09:10", "mean that's all the most part yeah", "09:12", "that's uh it is it's a troubling aspect", "09:17", "of that thing that they do where they", "09:19", "suggest the next videos which didn't", "09:21", "used to be a thing it used to be you", "09:23", "would go to YouTube", "09:24", "you would watch a video right and then", "09:26", "you would go find another video right", "09:28", "they didn't suggest anything and then", "09:30", "somewhere along the line I don't", "09:32", "remember what year it was but this", "09:33", "started happening and then they start", "09:35", "Auto playing the next video autoplay", "09:37", "yeah I think there was a some kind of", "09:40", "recommendation thing very early on but", "09:43", "initially it might have been restricted", "09:45", "to just other videos from the same", "09:46", "channel you're watching probably and at", "09:49", "a certain point it started to recommend", "09:51", "other things and I don't know if you", "09:53", "look at your analytics and see what", "09:55", "percentage of your views are coming from", "09:57", "that recommendations feed from other", "09:59", "stuff hmm but it's significant for a lot", "10:03", "of YouTube channels the the tagging your", "10:06", "videos and getting the right meta data", "10:08", "on them in order to bring an audience is", "10:10", "an important thing so it's a", "10:12", "double-edged sword in some sense it", "10:13", "sounds it sounds like you know to get", "10:15", "back to what you were saying about so", "10:17", "rich labelled you Oh is Richard okay you", "10:19", "know I was gonna say it they labeled you", "10:20", "is right but you're not right dude well", "10:22", "it's just it's disingenuous I mean I've", "10:24", "said it over and over and over again", "10:25", "I've never voted for a Republican in my", "10:27", "life I voted independent for Gary", "10:29", "Johnson just because he did my podcast", "10:31", "okay and I wasn't happy with Clinton and", "10:33", "I wasn't happy with Trump just like this", "10:34", "is just gross I'm just gonna vote for", "10:36", "Gary Johnson I mean I didn't think he", "10:38", "was gonna win you know I had almost no", "10:41", "chance when you didn't know where what", "10:43", "aleppo was right I was like that was his", "10:45", "he was his scream you know like", "10:47", "what's-his-face from New Hampshire and", "10:49", "Howard Dean Howard Dean yeah Barney also", "10:53", "I assume if I'm sure it wasn't going to", "10:55", "Joe yeah but people conveniently will", "11:00", "just as or they'll say that like you're", "11:01", "a Trojan horse they're like a pretend", "11:05", "left-wing /", "11:06", "who's really just pushing right-wing", "11:07", "ideologies well which one which which",

"11:19", "that could be levied if one wanted to", "11:23", "make it into a criticism would be if you", "11:26", "engage with right-wing ideas that you", "11:30", "don't agree with right like I take you", "11:32", "at your face you know face value that", "11:33", "you don't agree with a lot of the stuff", "11:34", "that your right-wing guests say one", "11:37", "could make the argument that by not", "11:39", "challenging those ideas it's implicitly", "11:42", "lending them more credibility than maybe", "11:45", "you think they should have that's", "11:46", "interesting because what I try to do", "11:49", "with people unless something saying", "11:51", "someone saying something egregious I try", "11:53", "to let them talk I want to know how they", "11:56", "feel I want to know what their thought", "11:57", "process is and so instead of just", "11:59", "challenging a minute on everything I", "12:01", "want them to elaborate right and I feel", "12:04", "like by doing that I get a sense of how", "12:07", "they've come to that conclusion and", "12:08", "whether it's logical right whether it's", "12:11", "when they're there they've actually used", "12:14", "their thoughts and they've really", "12:16", "calculated and thought this is the", "12:18", "position I take and this is why and I a", "12:20", "lot of people don't know there's a lot", "12:22", "of a lot of times we challenge people in", "12:24", "their positions you find out like they", "12:26", "don't really know what the fuck they're", "12:27", "talking about and that the best way to", "12:29", "find that out is to let them talk yes I", "12:31", "can - someone's on climate change right", "12:33", "that was I mean there's the Socratic", "12:35", "method of questioning you know which is", "12:37", "why do you think that and how do you", "12:39", "know that that's true", "12:40", "etc etc and sort of some other questions", "12:42", "that that come from it which I do as", "12:45", "well I mean I think I don't know to tie", "12:47", "it to the Richard Spencer interview that", "12:49", "I did some of the criticism I received", "12:51", "after was from people on the left I mean", "12:54", "the people I would assume it was most of", "12:56", "it was people in the law for doing the", "12:57", "interview yes or for what I said in the", "12:59", "interview for ready okay yeah for doing", "13:01", "the interview at all the criticism was", "13:03", "more from the left right for what I said", "13:04", "in the interview the criticism was more", "13:06", "from the right from people who just", "13:08", "agreed with Richard Spencer like what", "13:09", "things did they agree with that it is", "13:12", "inevitable that people with different", "13:15", "ethnic or religious backgrounds simply", "13:19",

or religious groups", "13:30", "separatism I mean literally separatism", "13:32", "that's sad", "13:33", "it's it's a sad thought that you just", "13:36", "can't get along with people that do", "13:38", "other things that that are interests", "13:40", "interested in other things that come", "13:41", "from other places that have different", "13:43", "religions that have different points of", "13:44", "view like why you oh well they they have", "13:48", "a series of you know decades of what", "13:51", "they call scholarship supporting their", "13:53", "view but for the context of my interview", "13:55", "I made it abundantly clear that I didn't", "13:57", "agree with that stuff right yeah and my", "14:00", "view is and everybody can have a", "14:01", "different view about how they do", "14:02", "interviews my view is if I just allow", "14:05", "the the what I consider to be disgusting", "14:08", "views to be spread out right you know", "14:10", "like a spray bottle just spray them", "14:12", "everywhere and not do anything else I", "14:14", "can't say that I'm doing something that", "14:16", "I think is valuable I don't feel like", "14:18", "it's valuable", "14:19", "so my my approach is are the ideas known", "14:24", "enough to be worth refuting that's", "14:26", "number one if it's some weird conspiracy", "14:29", "theory that has not even any following", "14:33", "whatsoever I'm probably not going to", "14:34", "choose to even entertain it because it's", "14:36", "irrelevant in sort of always so my first", "14:38", "question is is was Richard Spencer", "14:41", "relevant at the time all right was", "14:42", "rising this guy was considered by many", "14:44", "the sort of creator of the alt-right he", "14:47", "was growing a following in the context", "14:49", "of the Trump candidacy at the time or", "14:51", "maybe administration I don't remember", "14:52", "when it wasn't real it was I think 2016", "14:56", "or trying to remember when it was I", "14:58", "don't remember when I first heard his", "14:59", "name yeah how did he become how did he", "15:02", "come to prominence I don't know the", "15:05", "sequence but I think he had a wet and", "15:07", "alt-right website that had articles of", "15:10", "some kind and then he that website", "15:15", "became more known and that fucking terms", "15:17", "so talk alright", "15:19", "you know alt left the centrist argues", "15:23", "did all these different labels are so", "15:24", "I'd rather talk about issues I can't", "15:26", "either", "15:26", "it's so clunky but so you know first", "15:29", "thing was I did want to interview him", "15:30", "but if I had felt", "15:32", "I wouldn't be prepared to make it", "15:33", "abundantly clear that I don't agree with", "15:35", "the guy and I think his ideas were", "15:36", "terrible I wouldn't have done the", "15:37", "internet right so the problem I had with", "15:40", "the critiques from the left of me doing", "15:42", "that some who said the last thing we", "15:44", "need to be doing is giving this guy a", "15:46", "voice that's often how they say it or a", "15:48", "platform my response was this guy's", "15:51", "getting interviewed in lots of other", "15:52", "places that aren't even challenging him", "15:54", "right I'm at least making an attempt", "15:56", "here to get something in the record that", "15:58", "there are arguments against these ideas", "16:01", "these are bad ideas and I don't want to", "16:03", "be part of the diffusion of just the", "16:05", "ideas themselves but I wanna be pushing", "16:07", "back I'm gonna have to watch that now", "16:08", "now when you did do that like what was", "16:10", "his response was during the interview", "16:12", "what was his response to your pushback", "16:13", "uh I mean he had answers", "16:15", "you know he was well prepared and I", "16:18", "don't know if there were they were", "16:19", "unique or new arguments that I was", "16:22", "making but there was no argument to be", "16:25", "made that I was letting him just parrot", "16:27", "white nationalist talking points", "16:28", "unopposed which I wouldn't I just", "16:29", "wouldn't feel good about that right it's", "16:31", "not how I do interviews yeah and then", "16:33", "the left was upset that you're giving", "16:34", "him air quotes a platform a very small",

right so", "24:22", "it's I feel a little socialized medicine", "24:25", "they are both well yes in some sense I", "24:27", "mean the Canadian system is administered", "24:29", "at the province level

are criticisms of all of", "25:06", "these systems but they're different ones", "25:07", "so when we say and the British and", "25:10", "Canadian systems aren't that good right", "25:12", "let's

treatment", "25:21", "whatever mm-hmm you really have to drill", "25:24", "down and figure out and what way are we", "25:26", "saying it's not as good yeah what I'm", "25:29", "saying is that there's no perfect system", "25:32", "there is no perfect systems are right", "25:33", "but I believe that most of the best", "25:36", "doctors in terms of like North America", "25:39", "at least are in the

economic philosophy like I'm a", "26:15", "capitalist I'm for social democracy", "26:17", "which is a mixed system that's a", "26:18", "capitalist system that says we're going", "26:21", "to invest tax revenue in a particular", "26:23", "way to make sure that no one falls below", "26:26", "a certain level so my just to", "26:29", "contextualise that my point of view is", "26:31", "not from one of becoming a socialist", "26:33", "country and I think we share those views", "26:35", "I think so a lot of doctors will say", "26:39", "that even though on sort of on paper in", "26:42", "a socialized medicine system they might", "26:45", "make less for a particular procedure for", "26:48", "example or something like that a lot of", "26:50", "them are still in favor of those systems", "26:53", "because it would drastically reduce", "26:55", "their overhead so there's an all of this", "26:58", "apparatus that includes medical billing", "27:00", "and coding both on the insurer and and", "27:03", "at the healthcare provider end the", "27:06", "hospital and the insurance company both", "27:07", "are battling over what is it that was", "27:10", "done right what are the codes that apply", "27:12", "here and how what are reimbursement", "27:14", "rates there's fraud when it comes to", "27:17", "that and that requires an apparatus for", "27:20", "investigating and adjudicating that that", "27:22", "adds more and more cost so I don't think", "27:26", "it's as easy I don't think it's as", "27:28", "obvious that under those systems at the", "27:30", "end of the day a doctor that owns a PCP", "27:34", "group for example or an orthopedic", "27:37", "clinic or whatever the case may be I", "27:39", "don't know that it's that clear that", "27:40", "they end up taking home less money hmm", "27:43", "that's interesting I'd wonder if in", "27:45", "practice that would play out that way", "27:47", "maybe maybe I'm talking about just like", "27:50", "high-end orthopedic

about anyway a lot of", "28:00", "those folks are often being paid out of", "28:02", "pocket anyway yes so it's less in", "28:05", "beliefs some at least some so for the", "28:06", "average person's experience I think it's", "28:08", "less relevant yeah then there's also", "28:10", "liability insurance which is extremely", "28:13", "expensive that's a giant issue with with", "28:15", "doctors it's a huge expense it is yeah I", "28:18", "mean I think it is necessary mm-hmm", "28:20", "there's a question as to whether it's", "28:22", "organized in the best way I know less", "28:24", "about that component than some of the", "28:26", "other ones you know the education in", "28:30", "health care those are the two things", "28:31", "that I think we can both agree and we", "28:34", "need to

that's what that is the strict", "28:42", "father mentality they're just the only", "28:45", "thing that it makes sense to me is that", "28:47", "you don't want people who are kind of", "28:49", "half-ass in college just right did that", "28:52", "can just get it", "28:52", "I think that that comes up a lot you", "28:55", "know you hear about so-called three", "28:57", "college which is it's free it's we're", "28:59", "saying we're paying for it through", "28:59", "taxation really important to point that", "29:01", "out it's it's just not for everybody", "29:04", "that's okay I mean I think that that", "29:06", "that sometimes gets lost and yes there", "29:09", "are more and more jobs that require", "29:11", "college degrees even though you could", "29:13", "make the case maybe the college degree", "29:14", "is not actually necessary but it's a way", "29:16", "to sort of thin the herd of applicants", "29:18", "in order to just make hiring you know", "29:21", "more more practical but I do think that", "29:25", "it's okay to say that college isn't for", "29:27", "everybody but the same ideas that apply", "29:30", "to so-called free college meaning", "29:31", "college paid for through education could", "29:33", "apply to trade school they could apply", "29:35", "to retraining programs there's a whole", "29:37", "bunch of other ways that it could be", "29:38", "done yeah no I agree yeah I just the", "29:42", "college is not for everyone thing is", "29:43", "more true now than ever before", "29:45", "particularly with certain technology", "29:48", "studies you're learning things during", "29:51", "your four years at a university that are", "29:53", "just gonna be completely outdated by the", "29:55", "time you graduate in in what kind of", "29:57", "program for example Jamie what he did", "29:59", "with audio engineering oh I see okay you", "30:01", "went to school for audio engineering by", "30:03", "the time he got out it was all useless", "30:04", "yeah but but that was not a four-year", "30:06", "bachelor's program right it is now oh it", "30:09", "is now okay I when I went there it", "30:11", "wasn't available for that but since then", "30:13", "they have made that available and that's", "30:15", "awesome in the time that YouTube has", "30:16", "made basically education free for a lot", "30:18", "of people sure so I mean I think with", "30:21", "that the issue is in my mind that when", "30:24", "you consider the cost relative to the", "30:29", "earnings potential as you pointed out", "30:31", "when you learn about $68,000 a year or", "30:34", "you know I went over this I guess taught", "30:35", "at Boston College and I think it was", "30:37", "like 64,000 all and something like that", "30:41", "depending on what field you're going", "30:42", "into it's it's almost impossible to pay", "30:45", "that off ever so some at some point", "30:48", "something needs to change and this kind", "30:50", "of gets us into the technological", "30:51",

those technological advancements", "31:10", "but as far as the education piece is", "31:13", "concerned it's completely unsustainable", "31:15", "the way it is now I knew about you", "31:18", "before

Boston College sorry and I", "31:28", "tweeted it and I was like right like", "31:30", "what what is this this is greatness so", "31:32", "it's a woman named Amy Siskind who I", "31:34", "don't know

that I'm confused", "57:11", "like who's not your videos whose videos", "57:14", "yeah so if we find out", "57:16", "on our videos someone is posting endless", "57:19", "comments oh yeah my personal view is if", "57:23", "it's not illegal I just just let it all", "57:25", "be there yes that's my personal view and", "57:27", "that's a great principle to have well we", "57:29", "don't touch them we do leave them alone", "57:30", "even though we get accused of it but the", "57:32", "the question is YouTube at one point in", "57:35", "time had thrown out there that they were", "57:37", "gonna make people responsible for the", "57:39", "things that were in their comments I", "57:40", "exactly remember that but it didn't", "57:42", "ultimately think they backed out but", "57:43", "very quickly when they realized that", "57:44", "places like yours right which like your", "57:46", "average video gets how many thousands of", "57:48", "comments a lot and many of them", "57:50", "anti-semitic and how would you yeah and", "57:52", "how would you even be able to look at", "57:54", "all those and you would have to be 24/7", "57:55", "monitoring embrace you've also got", "57:57", "people that are watching your videos", "57:58", "from overseas at all times of the night", "58:00", "yep so I think that the principle of", "58:03", "only only illegal content will be", "58:05", "removed is great that's a personal", "58:08", "principle however I think that there is", "58:11", "no serious case to be made that a", "58:14", "private company can't say these are our", "58:19", "Terms of Service and if you want to I", "58:21", "mean it's sort of almost a conservative", "58:22", "principle right the idea that unless", "58:24", "illegal things are going on we are not", "58:27", "going to tell a business how it is that", "58:29", "that it should be run and that's where I", "58:31", "think a lot of right-wingers start to", "58:34", "stumble on this issue because they're", "58:35", "calling for a very invasive form of", "58:38", "government regulation they're calling", "58:40", "for the government to step in and even", "58:43", "break up these organization serves", "58:45", "they've gotten too large but you're", "58:46", "hearing that from the left as well yeah", "58:47", "well I think there's a different there's", "58:49", "a difference though between Elizabeth", "58:50", "Warren

"anything unless the content is illegal", "59:13", "because there are financial", "59:14", "considerations right I mean there's lots", "59:16", "of content that would not be illegal but", "59:19", "it would make a platform a video", "59:21", "platform like YouTube not financially", "59:23", "viable because advertisers would see it", "59:25", "and they'd say oh we're not going near", "59:26", "that right so I have a very hard time", "59:29", "taking what is a very authoritarian", "59:31", "perspective that the government should", "59:33", "come in and say this is how social", "59:35", "networks should be run now if you want", "59:37", "to change the law here's the way it", "59:39", "could be done if you want to change the", "59:41", "law and argue that these platforms have", "59:43", "gotten so big that they represent more", "59:46", "of a town square so to speak then okay", "59:50", "maybe you could pass a law that changes", "59:52", "how they would be regulated but that's", "59:54",

someone", "60:30", "gets harassed like Carlos Mesa was", "60:32", "because of this where people are sending", "60:34", "him all these homophobic tweets and all", "60:37", "these getting text messages and all this", "60:39", "shit that's that's the unsavory and", "60:41", "unfortunate aspect of it how do you stop", "60:44", "that I don't know how you stop it I", "60:46", "don't know exactly how you stop it but I", "60:47", "think it would be useful I mean one", "60:50", "thing is when does a platform get big", "60:52", "enough in your mind that it would", "60:53", "qualify for this like Town Square", "60:55", "designation well for sure YouTube let's", "60:58", "talk about that one because that's the", "60:59", "one we're on I mean fuckin goddamn it", "61:01", "it's huge", "61:01", "okay jag antic so are there other types", "61:04", "of businesses through which", "61:06", "communication happens that you think", "61:09", "should be regulated in the same way", "61:11", "that's not really clear so I'll give an", "61:13", "example if you start regularly sending", "61:16", "people via UPS similar things to some of", "61:23", "the content that exists on YouTube and", "61:25", "UPS says we're getting reports that", "61:28", "you're sending people harassing stuff we", "61:31", "don't want you as a customer here's the", "61:32", "questions a question though isn't there", "61:34",

"61:47", "well you don't necessarily have to read", "61:49", "them there's a difference in a practical", "61:50", "sense but I guess the question is would", "61:52", "we want the government would you", "61:54", "similarly want the government to enforce", "61:56", "for telephone companies if you are", "61:59", "harassing getting harassing texts and", "62:01", "you report it and report it that's a", "62:03", "different thing I think I think what is", "62:05", "coming to your phone and the phone is", "62:07", "ringing I think that's another step", "62:09", "that's another step towards invasive", "62:12", "it's a big gray area yes is the phone", "62:14", "ringing is it a phone call where the", "62:16", "text is it whatsapp message read that", "62:18", "text right yeah no I feel you", "62:20", "I guess the quite where I hesitate and", "62:22", "again speaking of someone from the left", "62:25", "who believes regulation of businesses is", "62:27", "an important thing I would want to be", "62:30", "really sure about how it exactly it is", "62:34", "that the government would step in and", "62:36", "mandate essentially that their view has", "62:40", "to be listened to over the Terms of", "62:42", "Service that a private company would", "62:43", "wish to have yes I feel like when you", "62:47", "give people a gun they start looking for", "62:48", "targets and that is a very common thing", "62:50", "if you give people the ability to censor", "62:52", "and if you give people the ability to", "62:54", "censor based on their political ideology", "62:56", "or based on

name again", "63:07", "the one who Amy Siskin imagine her young", "63:11", "in charge of a social media platform she", "63:13", "tried to get you fired from Boston", "63:14", "College for something that was", "63:15", "incredibly polite right that is what I'm", "63:18", "talking about is their very action that", "63:20", "very same type of thinking that she", "63:23", "tried to impose on you that's what I'm", "63:25", "worried about well they're worried about", "63:26", "people that are really strictly trying", "63:28", "to promote their ideologies and what", "63:31", "they think is okay

it's not nice to call", "63:50", "someone a little less be queer it's not", "63:52", "nice it's kind of mean you know and", "63:54", "especially when that guy wasn't even", "63:55", "engaging with him but", "63:56", "he's making fun of him he's a comedy", "63:57", "show he's mocking them so the question", "63:59", "becomes like when when is that mocking", "64:01", "considered homophobic and when is it", "64:04", "just ribbing right and that's his", "64:05", "position his position is that it's just", "64:07", "ribbing this is the problem with a", "64:09", "discussion that is only about the", "64:12", "principle so like a lot of our", "64:13", "conversation for the last 15 minutes has", "64:15", "been what is our principle about what", "64:18", "types of business regulation is okay for",

versus", "64:30", "something that is more strict hmm the", "64:33", "reality is that it's a there's a more", "64:35", "gray area yeah we're trying to sort of", "64:38", "regulate the way people communicate with", "64:40", "each other so it's it's not it's like if", "64:42", "someone said that to someone in a bar a", "64:45", "cop would not arrest them like yeah you", "64:47", "listview a little queer you know that", "64:49", "would be like oh that guy's an asshole", "64:50", "but the bar would be perfectly within", "64:52", "their legal right to say we don't we", "64:54", "don't want you in here you're making our", "64:55", "customers uncomfortable and nobody would", "64:57", "say that it would be against the law for", "64:59", "the bar to say you got to go and that's", "65:01", "a good point if they were doing it to", "65:02", "their face but what if he was in a", "65:04", "corner talking about this guy that", "65:07", "wasn't there and he was saying yeah so", "65:09", "he's talking about an Tifa this lispy", "65:11", "little Mexican queer if you came along", "65:13", "and decided to kick the guy out of the", "65:14", "bar then it would I mean listen at some", "65:17",

"65:31", "between that and something like YouTube", "65:32", "which again falls more in line with like", "65:34", "a town square maybe that's what we need", "65:36", "to revisit because so much human", "65:38", "communication is now happening across", "65:40", "these platforms I would imagine most of", "65:42", "it or most of it we we need to maybe", "65:44", "stop drawing this arbitrary

this is some torn", "65:59", "here right on one side I say well it", "66:02", "seems like they still allow him to have", "66:06", "his freedom of expression because he's", "66:09", "still on YouTube", "66:10", "he still is able to upload his show on", "66:12", "YouTube he will have to find other ways", "66:14", "to make money sure so one part of me", "66:16", "looks at it that way and no one has a", "66:17", "right to monetize on YouTube right right", "66:20", "so in a sense they haven't violated his", "66:23", "First Amendment rights because he's", "66:24", "still able to express himself but then", "66:27", "you go as a company they've made a", "66:29", "punitive decision to eliminate his", "66:33", "ability or is it radically reduced his", "66:35", "ability to make an income off of their", "66:37", "platform that seems like and I'm not", "66:40", "supporting that they did it but that", "66:41", "seems more reasonable as a decision", "66:45", "right to say we're gonna demonetised you", "66:48", "that seems more reasonable but the", "66:52", "problem is there's no alternatives", "66:54", "there's nothing remotely like YouTube to", "66:58", "avert there's an alternative to

enforcing its", "67:18", "policies how so I mean they just this", "67:21", "just this particular issue but this", "67:23", "isn't this isn't a left-wing how is this", "67:26", "a left-wing enforcement I mean they", "67:27", "think it is because Carlos Mesa is", "67:29", "progressive and because the the argument", "67:31", "that he was making is a very left-wing", "67:33", "progressive argument and
