what they do", "101:32", "is they come in and they'll help you", "101:33", "with with things like that and and but", "101:38", "sometimes it doesn't work for people you", "101:40", "know and that's that's the thing is like", "101:42", "people coming to this thing going oh I", "101:44", "made it I've got this deal but if your", "101:46", "record doesn't they've invested all this", "101:50", "money so it's kind of it puts this extra", "101:52", "pressure on you to figure out what you", "101:55", "need to do to make it and I think some", "101:58", "people go down a different route and", "102:01", "would change up switch up their thing", "102:02", "and and but they can be very helpful", "102:06", "yeah it depends on your attitude to a", "102:08", "lot of it is your attitude and what you", "102:10", "think of like you know are you being", "102:12", "taken advantage of or a system just", "102:15", "gonna pay off because there's so it goes", "102:17", "so up and down", "102:19",

"102:25", "of it would put a dark cloud over it", "102:26", "there's that and I think there's also", "102:28", "the misconception that once you get a", "102:31", "big record deal and I've had a few where", "102:34", "you think all of a sudden like you have", "102:36", "to stop doing something and they're", "102:38", "gonna do it for you that is like the", "102:40", "biggest mistake you could

depends it depends on", "102:52", "the company but you know essentially", "102:55", "like when you sign a deal with these", "102:58", "with these folks like they have a lot of", "103:00", "your creative integrity in some ways", "103:03", "depending on the deal on how it's shaped", "103:05", "and you know they own your copyright if", "103:10", "they want to own your record depending",
