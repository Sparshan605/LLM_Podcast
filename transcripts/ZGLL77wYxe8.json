theory you know the old", "04:35", "idea that antioxidants hurt the Dean yes", "04:37", "just throw that out for a while", "04:40", "maybe forever what I think is going on", "04:42", "is that the DNA is getting modified and", "04:44", "the cell can't read the DNA the way it", "04:48", "used to okay that's really important and", "04:50", "so the clock is not just a clock it's", "04:52", "not a

million", "05:11", "people every day buying drinks with", "05:12", "antioxidants in them but antioxidants", "05:14", "have with very few exceptions failed to", "05:18", "extend the life span of any

brought this up is", "05:30", "really important resveratrol was", "05:32", "originally thought to be an antioxidant", "05:33", "and it is a mild antioxidant but the way", "05:36", "it really works we know this is a fact", "05:38", "from my lab is that it's stimulating the", "05:40", "body's defenses against aging and", "05:43", "disease because it's it's binding to", "05:45", "these enzymes that we work on called", "05:47", "sirtuins and these are the defenders of", "05:49", "the body and you were saying the if I", "05:52", "remember correctly you take resveratrol", "05:53", "you take a powdered form actually bought", "05:56", "exactly what you take and you mix it", "05:58", "with yogurt in the morning is a how you", "06:00", "do it yep what's the dose that you take", "06:03", "well it probably comes out to about a", "06:05", "gram in a gram yeah okay so if someone's", "06:08", "taking capsules what depends if it", "06:12", "probably capsules at 250 milligrams", "06:14", "that'd be okay before yeah you know I'm", "06:17", "still alive so that's its look good oh", "06:19", "thank you do you um is it important to", "06:23", "take it with fats is that why you take", "06:25", "it with yogurt yeah yeah either high", "06:27", "protein which is Greek yogurt surfaces", "06:32", "or fat but water ill it's like brick", "06:34", "dust it won't dissolve and absorbed but", "06:37", "a glass of whole milk maybe would be", "06:39", "okay yeah that's great", "06:40", "it has to have something to bind to is", "06:42", "that the deal for sure yeah in in our", "06:43", "studies in humans and in mice if we", "06:45", "didn't give them high-fat food it barely", "06:48", "got in it was fivefold less now this", "06:50", "study of metformin DHEA and human growth", "06:55", "hormone does not include nmn right so", "07:00", "but nmn is also effective", "07:03", "well let's delve in a little bit please", "07:05", "if you read the paper and I have turns", "07:09", "out one of the effects of this treatment", "07:11", "was the reduction in the levels of a", "07:14", "protein called cd38 cd38 resides on", "07:18", "immune cells and it goes up as we get", "07:21", "older and what they found one of the", "07:23", "biggest effects of the treatment was the", "07:25", "levels of this city 30 a protein went", "07:27", "down so what is the CD 38 this is the", "07:30", "main enzyme in our bodies that degrades", "07:32", "nad nad is required for the sore - and", "07:36", "defenders to work so one possibility is", "07:38", "that and I'm sure it's complicated but", "07:40", "one way this could be working is by", "07:42", "allowing your body to make nad and store", "07:45", "it rather than degrading it as we get", "07:47", "older", "07:48", "interesting so would supplementing with", "07:53", "nmn which is a form of nad correct a", "07:56", "precursor yeah precursor would that", "08:00", "enhance the effects do you believe like", "08:02", "if they try to do a new study it could", "08:04", "could it could potential each of these", "08:06", "patients cost ten thousand dollars for", "08:08", "the treatment so it's it's not easy to", "08:10", "do these studies ten thousand dollars", "08:12", "for the entirety of the treatment and", "08:15", "the treatment lasts how long I don't", "08:18", "remember how long they treated the", "08:19", "patients for but I do know that it", "08:23", "wasn't cheap that's why they only did", "08:24", "nine because I've first I said to my", "08:26", "friend Steve Horvath nine patients you", "08:29", "kidding me why didn't you do fifty and I", "08:30", "went well we didn't have the money", "08:31", "that's the that's the plan anyway my", "08:34", "point really is that we need to test a", "08:36", "lot of different combinations include", "08:38", "anim and include there's one called", "08:40", "rapamycin which is a little bit more", "08:42", "risky and toxic but there are better", "08:43", "molecules in development the question is", "08:46", "what is the best combination and do you", "08:48", "use it with exercise and fasting or is", "08:51", "it bad to combine them all together we", "08:52", "don't know yet", "08:54", "that's a good question to that I wanted", "08:55", "to ask you because one of the things", "08:57", "that came out of the podcast was input", "08:59", "from some other people that I know that", "09:00", "are nutrition experts and performance", "09:02", "experts that were skeptical about", "09:04", "metformin and they were saying that", "09:06", "metformin although it may have an", "09:09", "anti-aging effect it actually decreases", "09:11", "physical performance and athletes well", "09:14", "that there is a study that shows that", "09:16", "and resveratrol to actually real can", "09:19", "prevent the great gains from hard", "09:22", "exercise so here's the solution that I", "09:25", "think is worth trying a solution and", "09:27", "that is a theme that I have in my book", "09:30", "and in my research and that is we don't", "09:32", "want to be doing everything every day", "09:34", "necessarily we want to pulse it we want", "09:36", "to shock the body and let it recover we", "09:38", "know that you can't just exercise I mean", "09:40", "some people have been on this show run", "09:42", "100 miles every every weekend but", "09:44", "generally you want to hit it hard and", "09:46", "let it recover here at hardly recover so", "09:48", "what I am planning to do and actually", "09:50", "started doing is on days that I'm", "09:52", "exercising and recovering I don't take", "09:54", "Matt Foreman and then when I'm just", "09:56", "sitting around or on a plane I do and", "09:57", "that way I think that my body can have", "09:59", "the best of both worlds so when you are", "10:02", "not exercising and you take it you feel", "10:05", "like it doesn't have a hit when you are", "10:08", "exercising and not taking it so it", "10:10", "somehow or another whatever performance", "10:12", "hit it has its temporary yeah right so", "10:16", "well this is all just theoretical it is", "10:19", "we're right on the cutting edge of human", "10:21", "knowledge we don't actually know what", "10:22", "the best thing is but my best guess is", "10:25", "that we want to allow the body to", "10:27", "recover so I don't take my Foreman on", "10:29", "those days rather than taking metformin", "10:30", "every day like a diabetic would mm-hmm", "10:32", "now what are what is the what's that hit", "10:35", "like what is happening what's the", "10:36", "mechanism behind the performance hit", "10:38", "from taking metformin oh we don't know", "10:41", "but I can tell you the best explanation", "10:45", "that I can give you somet Foreman is a", "10:48", "derivative of a plant molecule the", "10:50", "French lilac so it's not a crazy", "10:52", "molecule it's pretty natural but what it", "10:54", "does is many things in the body", "10:55", "scientists will quite annoyingly argue", "10:59", "about it for they have for the last 40", "11:01", "years so there's no correct answer but", "11:04", "what I think is going on is that", "11:05", "metformin is", "11:06", "interfering with the mitochondrial", "11:08", "mitochondria in the cell mitochondria", "11:09", "that we call the battery packs they're", "11:11", "basically making chemical energy without", "11:13", "that chemical energy we'd be dead in", "11:15", "about 20 seconds so we need that for", "11:17", "life so metformin interrupts that energy", "11:19", "production in the mitochondria but you", "11:23", "need the mitochondria to amplify after", "11:25", "you've exercised so they're they're", "11:27", "antagonizing each other so why does", "11:29", "metformin work by inhibiting the", "11:32", "mitochondria the body gets a signal that", "11:34", "it doesn't have enough chemical energy", "11:35", "it's not making enough so it expands the", "11:38", "number of mitochondria these are ancient", "11:40", "remnants of bacteria that entered", "11:42", "ourselves and we have less if we sit", "11:45", "around and like we are now and we have", "11:47", "more if we exercise in metformin by", "11:50", "telling the body shit we're running out", "11:51", "of energy the body responds it makes", "11:53", "more mitochondria just like exercise", "11:54", "does but I think if you're taking", "11:57", "metformin and exercising that inhibition", "12:00", "is preventing the benefits somehow of", "12:02", "what you get with exercise perhaps", "12:05", "preventing your house so like what what", "12:06", "did the study or what studies have been", "12:08", "done and what did they reveal I don't", "12:11", "remember the precise details of the", "12:12", "study it was it was giving metformin", "12:14", "every day to people who were in a", "12:17", "controlled exercise I think was", "12:19", "treadmill a few times a week but then", "12:23", "what they measured was the mitochondrial", "12:24", "benefit now that and I think they", "12:27", "measured a bit of strength so confusing", "12:29", "that there's a Mitel mitochondrial", "12:30", "benefit but a performance hit well no", "12:34", "they actually the metformin prevented", "12:36", "the mitochondria from amplifying up oh", "12:38", "all right so then it must be interfering", "12:42", "with the signal that you get from", "12:44", "exercise whatever that is we don't know", "12:45", "exactly what that is so you'd really", "12:49", "have to be some sort of a guinea pig to", "12:51", "try to fuck with this stuff to go back", "12:53", "and forth from taking it and exercising", "12:55", "not taking it yeah and I'm sorry I'm one", "12:58", "of those guinea pigs", "12:59", "yeah and what do you no disrespect but", "13:03", "how hard are you working out not enough", "13:05", "yeah I'm saying spend three hours a week", "13:08", "in the gym that's not bad it's all in", "13:11", "one day that's maintenance oh one day", "13:13", "yeah really one day three hours yeah", "13:16", "that's ridiculous", "13:17", "that way cuz I miss Maura but you're so", "13:19", "smart", "13:20", "that drives me crazy when smart people", "13:22", "do dumb shit", "13:23", "like I had Peter Hotez on the podcast", "13:25", "who's a brilliant man in from the", "13:28", "University of Texas he's a researcher in", "13:31", "tropical diseases and he's obsessed with", "13:33", "diseases and the importance of", "13:35", "vaccinations all these different things", "13:37", "things talking about how his diet is", "13:39", "terrible", "13:39", "junk food it's constantly jackin the-box", "13:41", "and shit I'm like what the fuck man", "13:43", "you're so smart and you're a guy who", "13:45", "works on diseases what's the number-one", "13:48", "cause of diseases oh yeah I don't get", "13:51", "that some of my clothes I ate the worst", "13:53", "food and they studied longevity crazy", "13:54", "it's crazy it's like they can't help", "13:57", "their impulses it's like there's so many", "13:59", "people like that that are obsessed with", "14:01", "various aspects of health or performance", "14:04", "but they just they just can't get it", "14:07", "together well I would work out more if I", "14:09", "had time I'm usually working till", "14:10", "midnight and after that I'm not really", "14:12", "you do have an excuse you have a crazy", "14:15", "work schedule you do have an excuse yeah", "14:17", "well I'm on planes Fitbit so I try to", "14:20", "exercise on the planes pretty hard do", "14:21", "you really want to do um you guys a", "14:24", "trash room you know squats so no he", "14:26", "thinks you're crazy yeah I've got a pee", "14:28", "lottery doing blow in there or something", "14:30", "yeah people think you're in there doing", "14:33", "meth yeah doing something in there once", "14:37", "yeah um so what do you do when you work", "14:39", "out I lift weights for an hour then do a", "14:43", "fair bit of stretching and then and then", "14:46", "actually do some hot and cold treatment", "14:47", "oh okay yeah you remember we did the", "14:50", "cryotherapy last time yes yeah that was", "14:52", "fantastic yeah you won't do it again", "14:53", "today yes I do fantastic Amanda yeah no", "14:56", "planning on doing it today I did hot", "14:58", "yoga", "14:58", "earlier so I like to do hot yoga in the", "15:01", "morning and then cryo after a podcast", "15:03", "that's how I like to mix it up all right", "15:05", "let's do it", "15:06", "all right I don't have a cryo handy at", "15:09", "my place but I do the sauna and then", "15:11", "cold tub and you should get a cryo", "15:13", "setup they're not that expensive you get", "15:15", "one what about these infrared boxes are", "15:18", "they any good", "15:18", "Oh first saunas I do not know but um", "15:22", "some people swear by them Laird Hamilton", "15:25", "who were talking about by the way", "15:26", "huggers are coughing his Fantasticks my", "15:28", "hand will tompa superfood coffee well", "15:30", "we'll get you more", "15:32", "Oh Jeff is going off to pick up our", "15:34", "Pablo Escobar mugshot

gonna have to get myself", "15:58", "some yeah it's delicious he saw me he", "16:00", "could just you don't need a machine", "16:01", "either you can mix it yourself he has", "16:02", "all the stuff you just pour it into", "16:04", "coffee yeah I mean he's he's a hero of", "16:06", "mine he's a stud he's 50 something", "16:08", "there's a thousand years old guy runs", "16:10", "mountains fucking

people who listen to the", "16:45", "podcasts afterwards my apologies because", "16:47", "I was I was coughing like that for like", "16:50", "four or five episodes and then I had", "16:53", "decided

found", "34:37", "going back a few million years Wow", "34:39", "and started there and then just went", "34:41", "through looking at the various animals", "34:45", "we saw the gorillas and we ended up few", "34:48", "days ago I was in Jerusalem looking at", "34:49", "where we come oh wow a real origins tour", "34:53", "yeah up there I think that's exciting", "34:56", "wow that is so cool so what was the most", "35:00", "unusual thing besides Jerusalem is that", "35:04", "the most unusual thing that's the most", "35:06", "insane thing where all the religions are", "35:08", "on top of each other", "35:09", "touching rocks and blessing is spring", "35:11", "and humans are crazy they'll worship", "35:14", "anything well I'm sure you've seen I was", "35:17", "in Germany once and were there for a UFC", "35:20", "and I was flipping through the channels", "35:21", "of the television and there was this", "35:23", "live feed from Mecca and this was pre", "35:28", "Instagram I was not on

this path and this", "36:35", "and we're all gonna be together in this", "36:37", "like this like super reinforced sense of", "36:40", "community that's actually ordained by", "36:42", "God himself well we all need that", "36:44", "feeling for me of science and the", "36:46", "fossils that I and my colleagues believe", "36:49", "with the origins everyone needs an", "36:51", "origin story here it is how would you", "36:54", "say that", "36:54", "kabaah kabah it's built around a sacred", "36:58", "black stone a meteorite that the Muslims", "37:00", "believe was placed by Abraham and Ismail", "37:02", "Ishmael in the corner of the Kaaba a", "37:06", "symbol of God's covenant with Abraham", "37:08", "and Ishmael and by extension with the", "37:11", "Muslim community itself hmm okay yeah", "37:14", "that this so it is it is actually a", "37:17", "meteorite which how incredible right", "37:20", "like a little bit of science and a", "37:22", "little bit of religion all wrapped up", "37:24", "together there's a discovery so this", "37:26", "this is what it looks like so you're", "37:27", "watching this the channel that I was", "37:30", "watching in Germany again this is", "37:31", "probably like more than 10 years ago 12", "37:35", "years ago perhaps and watching this", "37:37", "circle around this like religious spot", "37:41", "it was very very captivating yeah the", "37:44", "one that I remember", "37:45", "from I think was Jerusalem yeah was", "37:48", "people touching the stone where the", "37:50", "crucifix was thought to be and there", "37:52", "would line up for hours to just touch it", "37:54", "for a few seconds meanwhile you know the", "37:58", "origin of humans the fossils there's", "37:59", "maybe two or three people hanging out no", "38:01", "one really cares admittedly it is out of", "38:03", "the way it's not in the middle of Middle", "38:05", "East but still it struck me that humans", "38:08", "are more focused on these icons of", "38:11", "religion rather than where I believe we", "38:13", "really came from Africa yeah I mean if", "38:17", "you look at it and you see it you touch", "38:19", "it you feel it it's the only sensible", "38:21", "explanation I mean you can still have", "38:22", "religion that's fine but you know don't", "38:24", "tell me those fossils were put there by", "38:26", "somebody no I mean obviously not but", "38:28", "it's it is that the idea that a human", "38:31", "being came from some lower hominid which", "38:35", "came originally from a shrew is so so", "38:39", "hard to follow like if you go all the", "38:40", "way back to 65 million years ago to the", "38:42", "asteroid hitting the Yucatan and you're", "38:45", "like wait what happened okay yeah big", "38:48", "rock smashed killed everything except", "38:51", "like these little rodent things and they", "38:52", "just eventually evolved yeah but that's", "38:55", "what I love about science it's amazing", "38:56", "it's not only amazing it's actually true", "38:59", "yeah we can prove it yeah me musically", "39:00", "you could really follow the fossil", "39:02", "record that's one of the funny things", "39:03", "and when people go oh what about the", "39:05", "missing link there's missing there's", "39:07", "holes in the fossil record well these", "39:08", "holes in your education just got holes", "39:12", "mean they

they're dead so", "42:59", "they're just making this human thing and", "43:01", "then the soldiers are shooting into the", "43:04", "pile trying to knock them down but they", "43:05", "get over the top of the wall and they", "43:07", "start infecting people that's pretty", "43:10", "wild ass movie yeah who wrote that movie", "43:13", "it's a wild movie man this is well it's", "43:16", "one of those zombie movies where the", "43:20", "zombies move fast", "43:21", "there's slow zombie movies which come on", "43:24", "man", "43:25", "like that's why Walking Dead like I feel", "43:27", "like

over there", "44:18", "when you were in the area where the", "44:22", "oldest human like fossils were found", "44:25", "what's the feeling like when you're in", "44:28", "this area like you you really are where", "44:30", "the origins of humankind are from I mean", "44:35", "there's got to be a pretty profound", "44:37", "feeling yeah it was spiritual", "44:39", "unfortunately that the people who drove", "44:41", "us they were saying hurry hurry you have", "44:43", "to go see some zebras this is more", "44:45", "important than the zebras but these are", "44:46", "the people that are the guides yeah yeah", "44:48", "they don't know what was important to us", "44:50", "fair enough but I would have loved to", "44:52", "have spent whole day there they", "44:55", "apparently there are still fossils", "44:56", "sticking out of the walls of the core", "44:57", "really yeah so the reason that it's a", "45:00", "view allowed to do anything with them I", "45:01", "don't know what happens if you find a", "45:04", "fossil yes it can University and you", "45:06", "just like shut the fuck up", "45:07", "well actually I I probably shouldn't", "45:10", "confess this on don't live me don't do", "45:13", "it bro tell me later it's not so bad", "45:16", "okay you can actually find a whole bunch", "45:19", "of stuff in Africa that's interesting if", "45:20", "you look down rather than out and my", "45:23", "oldest daughter our oldest daughter Alex", "45:25", "she looked out she's a scientist and so", "45:28", "she 16 year old scientist she found a", "45:30", "whole bunch of stone tools whoa not", "45:33", "there not not in Olduvai Gorge that", "45:35", "sacred but you know just out on the", "45:37", "Serengeti or wherever did you get them", "45:40", "analyzed not yet they've recently found", "45:45", "stone tools in the United States that", "45:47", "they've brought back to 16,000 years ago", "45:51", "the oldest known stone tools of any", "45:55", "human being and it's sort of there", "45:57", "they're slowly but surely pushing back", "46:00", "the dates of human civilization in", "46:02", "America and one of the more recent", "46:04", "discoveries with stone tools that are", "46:06", "from 16,000 years ago so people had made", "46:10", "their way over here or here it is about", "46:14", "this yeah so you never saw it I don't", "46:16", "know if you saw it yet they said it", "46:18", "there's I don't know if they have video", "46:20", "of it but they said they saw this monkey", "46:21", "sharpening that stone before it was", "46:23", "actually breaking the glass with it", "46:25", "glass was sharpened stone impressive", "46:28", "Prison Break attempt man fuck keeping", "46:30", "monkeys in a cage that drives me so", "46:33", "crazy I I hate it I went I took a pot", "46:37", "edible once but a real", "46:39", "wrong one and I went to the zoo it was", "46:41", "so depressing staring at the chimps I've", "46:43", "sat across and watched the chimp

hell yeah", "47:02", "it is", "47:04", "it's brutal actually that the the stone", "47:07", "tools are interesting because again", "47:09", "getting to what's natural what's natural", "47:10", "for primates is to change their", "47:12", "environment to take tools too yes so", "47:15", "what we did what we're doing", "47:16", "genetic genetic engineering well I want", "47:20", "say engineering but we're using", "47:20", "genetically just and why we are the", "47:22", "agent why we don't have to it is natural", "47:24", "of course that's what we do all of even", "47:27", "all of science is natural you could even", "47:29", "argue that an iPhone in your pocket is", "47:31", "natural sure", "47:32", "humans have created it they exist all", "47:34", "over the world right I've argued that", "47:36", "the cities are natural it's a completely", "47:38", "normal thing for humans to do to create", "47:41", "cities to say that cities are unnatural", "47:43", "well why are they everywhere and why are", "47:45", "human beings mango I st. beehives are", "47:47", "unnatural to write clothes yeah", "47:49", "unnatural", "47:49", "well animal habitat I mean animals like", "47:53", "beavers create beaver dens and they're", "47:54", "they're very uniform they're real", "47:57", "similar everywhere they go", "47:58", "exactly yeah yeah the other day someone", "48:00", "said humans tamed fire 500,000 years ago", "48:03", "and I said that can't be true 500,000", "48:06", "years ago that's not too long ago I", "48:09", "checked it out it's true and these", "48:11", "weren't even humans these or pre human I", "48:13", "think it was probably one of the two", "48:15", "species back we've been doing this we", "48:17", "didn't change the environment using", "48:18", "tools using fire for that long the fire", "48:21", "when it's crazy right because it's not", "48:23", "just manipulating a physical thing it's", "48:24", "changing the state right you're you're", "48:27", "doing something whether it's with flint", "48:28", "and stun you know some something to", "48:31", "spark and some tinder you're really", "48:33", "creating changing the state of matter", "48:35", "well we are and will continue to do that", "48:38", "will continue to evolve and one of the", "48:40", "that the reasons that I wanted to see", "48:41", "human origins is in my book I talked", "48:44", "about we've evolved to our natural", "48:46", "lifespan we're now at a maximum 122 is", "48:49", "the longest lived human that ostensibly", "48:51", "is on record", "48:52", "the so without intervention we've", "48:55", "reached our maximum but why not now give", "48:58", "us what evolution failed to give us why", "49:00", "can't we be like other species that are", "49:02", "at the top of their game are there any", "49:04", "factors when you look at the oldest", "49:06", "people that are alive are there any", "49:07", "common factors actually not really that", "49:10", "they do seem to have a collection of", "49:12", "gene variants that predispose them to", "49:15", "get to that long there's one called Fox", "49:17", "o3 that if you've done your genome we", "49:20", "can ever look 23andme

gave it a gave it a shot so", "76:30", "to speak yeah how was it uh it was fine", "76:34", "it was fine now let's get to the science", "76:36", "in a minute but what I found was so was", "76:39", "a shot in the butt with Heidi so why", "76:42", "didn't they do it intravenously I", "76:44", "thought that was the move they did", "76:45", "intramuscularly right right this doctor", "76:47", "is

is defrost like what temperature's", "81:41", "out of 35 Celsius", "81:44", "whatever that is a 91 Zen 90 95 so", "81:48", "you're using like a Dutch oven or", "81:49", "something like that that's

just jokes", "95:04", "don't get it touchy", "95:06", "yeah so you don't need to so that when", "95:09", "we treated mice with resveratrol they", "95:11", "were immune to the effect of high-fat",

what", "95:50", "you recommend people take right I don't", "95:54", "recommend people take anything but okay", "95:56", "what you take right let's just say that", "95:58", "yeah I don't recommendation sorry folks", "96:00", "yeah I'm taking a higher dose because", "96:02", "I've looked at human clinical data and I", "96:04", "think that a higher dose may be required", "96:07", "to have an even

and when we looked at", "96:36", "their metabolism it was like a younger", "96:38", "Mouse so let me ask you this then", "96:40", "because you're you take statins if you", "96:43", "are fairly convinced because the", "96:45", "research of the positive benefits of", "96:47", "resveratrol in healthy aging and healthy", "96:50", "metabolism and their arteries why you", "96:53", "take in

ripped I mean he really at I", "98:37", "think he started training at 58 or 59 he", "98:44", "started and then by the time he was 62", "98:46", "you know like a full six-pack it was", "98:48", "crazy

"should try oh yeah yeah a little bit of", "99:09", "shame that I haven't been able to get", "99:10", "off the statins but they just scare me", "99:12", "man I've just read too many things well", "99:15", "you know I could have gone off them when", "99:17", "I was on a really lean diet", "99:19", "I tried this Okinawa diet from Okinawa", "99:22", "okay now yeah so just fish mostly in and", "99:25", "and tofu mmm yeah how'd it go I was", "99:29", "great but then I had kids oh you can't", "99:31", "feed tofu the kids everyday right you", "99:33", "can't have separate food just for",

three times in a row the way", "101:07", "it's going that could definitely happen", "101:09", "well do you get a lot of sleep I do now", "101:12", "now that I'm wondering it yeah what's a", "101:16", "lot of sleep for you between 6 & 7 hours", "101:19", "oh that's good dr. Matthew Walker was a", "101:24", "guy that I had on my podcast who studies", "101:25", "sleep and he was fascinating and it", "101:28", "changed my entire opinion about what's", "101:30", "necessary there's a direct correlation", "101:32", "between limited amounts of sleep and", "101:34", "Alzheimer's direct correlation he's like", "101:36", "it's one of the most established links", "101:38",

"skeptical sure as to whether if you're", "101:50", "predisposed Alzheimer's you have trouble", "101:53", "sleeping oh and you start taking ambien", "101:56", "now people say well ambien and", "101:58", "Alzheimer's are correlated well yeah", "102:00", "that maybe it's the other way around", "102:02", "yeah a me and scares the shit out of me", "102:05", "you don't take that do tiny bits Oh", "102:08", "that stuff's nuts because people take it", "102:11", "and they say things they don't know what", "102:12", "they're saying right well the", "102:14", "recommended dose at least it used to be", "102:15", "for men is 10 milligrams which is", "102:17", "massive i nibble on I take maybe a", "102:19", "milligram just to nod off if I'm", "102:21", "desperate with jet lag hmm but yeah I", "102:23", "peek doctor as many I know say the 10", "102:25", "milligrams is probably too high but", "102:27", "check with your doctor", "102:28", "yeah well Matthew Walker says stay the", "102:31", "fuck away from that stuff period he said", "102:33", "you're not getting real sleep anyway", "102:34", "you're not going in through full sleep", "102:36", "cycles you're just drugging your brain",

have you", "102:45", "tried other like melatonin things along", "102:49", "those lines", "102:49", "I sure sure not effective uh not as much", "102:53", "sometimes melatonin with milligram of",

so far", "114:10", "away like wow let's keep an eye on them", "114:12", "yeah that's true there is the fear that", "114:15", "that some countries gonna engineer an", "114:17", "army of Solomons I mean

just that we don't", "130:12", "know the consequences and the FDA's job", "130:13", "is to protect us yeah just like they're", "130:15", "protecting us raw milk bunch of pussies", "130:17", "just recently shut down about a month", "130:18", "ago I missed the boat could have been in", "130:22", "there man but if you did that that's", "130:23", "something that you'd have to do on a", "130:24",

is", "132:16", "measure the clock now that we yes right", "132:19", "yes that would be interesting but based", "132:22", "on what we know about how it works with", "132:24", "mice you think it's

yeah there's", "133:01", "something that is really interesting and", "133:03", "that's called sena lytx Sano Linux yeah", "133:07", "so Senna lytx are drugs that kill off", "133:11", "cines\u00edn", "133:11", "cells so what our senescence cells these", "133:14", "are often called zombie cells and what I", "133:17", "think is - World War Z yes a lot of", "133:19", "zombies this podcast so senescence cells", "133:22", "we've known for decades exist in the", "133:25", "body but what was not clear was whether", "133:27", "they cause aging now it's pretty clear", "133:29", "from animal

when I was", "134:06", "saying that the the clock is part of the", "134:09", "aging process what we think is that as", "134:11", "we get older that and it's it's detailed", "134:14", "a lot more in my
