for", "04:24", "more revisions and then when they accept", "04:26", "it", "04:26", "that means the journal is ready to", "04:28", "publish it but then the publishing", "04:30", "process requires all

evolves", "44:43", "it's evolving it's a fucking living", "44:45", "being we want you know the entire today", "44:48", "family will continue to bring you", "44:50", "informative and important stories just", "44:52", "as we always have and look to black guys", "44:55", "and a brown chick it's a hundred percent", "44:59", "diverse princess all divorce that's the", "45:03", "thing in a way that a diversity is", "45:05", "defined if you had a panel it was just", "45:07", "black guys it would be 100% diverse yes", "45:10", "so they've redefined the word diversity", "45:12", "they need to find the word inclusion you", "45:14", "know but but to people outside the", "45:16", "Academy they they think Oh diversity", "45:18", "it's a great thing right you know we had", "45:20", "but that's not what it means", "45:21", "it means kind of when everybody has the", "45:24", "same ideas about something it it's also", "45:26", "when you if you're enforcing diversity", "45:29", "for what we we have to we would have to", "45:32", "find out like ultimately the goal is to", "45:34", "find out what what causes people to", "45:38", "succeed and especially succeeding in", "45:42", "something as benign is talking right", "45:45", "you're just talking that's all you're", "45:46", "doing", "45:46", "so what causes someone to succeed in", "45:49", "talking what makes their ideas valuable", "45:51",

"46:01", "at the root level what doesn't work is", "46:04", "saying we need one Chinese lady", "46:06", "we need one black guy and we need one", "46:09", "white guy because if you do something", "46:11", "like that you're not gonna get the best", "46:13", "she'll know or you're not gonna get the", "46:15", "best anything well you're not even", "46:16", "guaranteed to achieve the goal you're", "46:17", "claiming so it's again it goes back to", "46:19", "theory in theory and I mean theory in", "46:22", "terms of postmodern critical theory that", "46:24", "this stuff's all based and that we", "46:25", "studied the idea is that if you have a", "46:27", "particular identity now you have a", "46:29", "particular view of the world", "46:30", "and people of other identities have", "46:32", "different ones and in fact there's this", "46:35", "whole thing called standpoint", "46:36", "epistemology that says that if you have", "46:38", "a marginalized identity you know more", "46:39", "about the world than other people", "46:40", "because you live in two worlds at once", "46:42", "so the the idea is oh if we get a black", "46:45", "guy in here he's had a different life", "46:47", "experience therefore he can speak truly", "46:50", "to that if you get a Chinese lady in", "46:51", "here she can speak to that so on and so", "46:53", "forth", "46:54", "so the guess is that by virtue merely of", "46:57", "bringing in people who look different", "46:59", "with different races or genders or sexes", "47:03", "or sexualities then you automatically", "47:06", "get a diverse set of opinions but that", "47:09", "doesn't work that's not how that", "47:11", "actually works you could take people of", "47:12", "every race educate them on the exact", "47:14", "same social justice curriculum and they", "47:16", "all think exactly the same thing but at", "47:18", "least in something like the hosting of", "47:20", "today's show you are just talking once", "47:23", "you put these sort of diversity", "47:24", "standards of something like mathematics", "47:26", "oh yeah that's that's when things get", "47:28", "super squirrely yeah they're trying to", "47:30", "do that a little bit you retweeted that", "47:32", "thing I wrote about mathematics and they", "47:34", "wanted people to sign it equity which is", "47:36", "another word that they've co-opted they", "47:39", "wanted folks to sign an equity statement", "47:41", "and a diversity statement and the thing", "47:42", "is displaying that explain what they're", "47:44", "trying to that you you have a commitment", "47:46", "to diversity yeah you have a commitment", "47:48", "to diversity and you have a commitment", "47:50", "to equity and so equity does not mean", "47:54", "treating people equally it's not like", "47:55", "you have a commitment to equality which", "47:57", "is we should all have assuring the to", "47:59", "equality its equity is defined", "48:02", "differently it's to make up for past and", "48:06", "justices or to make up for some", "48:11", "deficiency that has occurred somewhere", "48:13", "along the line so yeah affirmative", "48:15", "action is an equity movement it's to", "48:17", "treat people differently in order to", "48:19", "level the playing field yeah so it's not", "48:21", "treating people it's not treating people", "48:23", "equally and that's the same thing

"48:40", "yeah and sociological definitions it's a", "48:42", "very specific thing that", "48:44", "means something slightly different from", "48:46", "what people say so here's the question", "48:47", "you should ask somebody anytime you hear", "48:49", "someone used the word equity just ask oh", "48:52", "I'm curious why didn't you use the word", "48:54", "equality can can you think can you think", "48:56", "of a it would the sentence be the same", "48:59", "with the meaning be the same well the", "49:00", "meaning is not the same that's why they", "49:01", "used equity and not well acquittee is a", "49:04", "finance word that's why it's weird is", "49:06", "also fun yeah so they don't make up new", "49:08", "words right they go opt yeah they coop", "49:11", "they change and then

I mean some", "108:22", "people are saying that math has", "108:23", "inherently got sexism or racism because", "108:25", "I guess apparently women and minorities", "108:28", "are going to be

diversity math", "108:57", "and I don't even know what that is but", "108:59", "it's not something that you would see", "109:01", "like a mathematic research level it's", "109:03", "something that you see at junior high", "109:04", "school elementary school that they're", "109:06", "teaching your kids which is why it's", "109:08", "scary as hell so is there a light at the", "109:13", "end of the

say that what you're seeing is", "110:37", "that this stuff as they've the the big", "110:40", "turn to making this applied was in the", "110:42", "90s right so they've had an entire", "110:44",
