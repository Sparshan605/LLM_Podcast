get a movie can you see that", "66:17", "scene I can see that that that that's", "66:21", "like that's what the entire movie leads", "66:22", "up to wonderful in the first monkey", "66:24", "figured out he could kill an animal with", "66:27", "like a tool like the firt like Australia", "66:29", "Pittacus or one of those oh yeah", "66:31", "primitive humans when the first one was", "66:34", "that stabbed something like a stabbed a", "66:37", "rat or a rabbit with a stick and went", "66:39", "holy shit right I can just use this tool", "66:42", "yeah what other tools I'm gonna start", "66:44", "eating yeah I'm gonna eat good because", "66:47", "if you didn't have a weapon how hard is", "66:49", "it for a person to kill something with", "66:51", "your hands what are you even gonna get", "66:54", "what are you gonna catch what the fuck", "66:57", "can you catch with your hands", "66:59", "well I can't catch a squirrel you'd be", "67:01", "just your hands no tools you'd be", "67:02", "hunting and gathering mostly I mean I", "67:04", "mean gathering I would say yeah you'd be", "67:06", "eating shit that you found on the ground", "67:08", "yeah that's primarily what you would eat", "67:10", "and then once in a while you'd get", "67:11", "something an animal but but yeah but", "67:13", "then they had yeah you're right they", "67:15", "obviously had to figure out different", "67:17", "ways of getting animals well it's one of", "67:20", "the shifts that they think took place", "67:21", "that allowed the human brain size to", "67:24", "double over a period of two million",

"67:34", "doubled over the period of two million", "67:36", "years it's one of the biggest mysteries", "67:37", "in the fossil record and his idea was", "67:40", "that they discovered mushrooms and that", "67:42", "the chimps over this period of time with", "67:45", "the monkey people whatever the fuck they", "67:46", "were in ancient hominids yeah had", "67:48", "discovered mushrooms after the climate", "67:50", "had shifted and he backs it up and he", "67:53", "did back at my place he's dead now", "67:54", "he backed it up with some climate data", "67:58", "that we know from you know core samples", "68:01", "and stuff like that yeah he thinks that", "68:03", "they experienced climate change where", "68:05", "the rainforest had receded in the", "68:07", "grasslands and that this gave birth to", "68:10", "the rise of ungulates like cows and you", "68:13", "know deer and things like that yeah and", "68:15", "they would shit these mushrooms would", "68:16", "grow on their shit and then they've", "68:20", "observed a lot of these monkeys in the", "68:22", "wild", "68:23", "picking up cow patties and looking for", "68:25", "grubs and beetles underneath it I think", "68:28", "they might have experimented with the", "68:29", "mushrooms and that if they experimented", "68:31", "with psilocybin mushrooms a lot of", "68:33", "things could take place once they", "68:34", "realized that it was not just a viable", "68:36", "food source but also provided them with", "68:38", "a bunch of different benefits one being", "68:40", "their vision and increases visual acuity", "68:42",

"68:52", "those things possibly could have given", "68:54", "birth to the two to language and to a", "68:57", "lot of other things they also think it's", "68:59", "possible that that creativity could have", "69:01", "enabled them to start hunting that they", "69:03", "started using tools and you in thinking", "69:05", "and and trying to figure out ways around", "69:07", "stuff and trying to you know try to", "69:10", "figure out how to make an effective", "69:12", "weapon to kill something in the distance", "69:13", "like the more they're thinking and", "69:14", "becoming creative the more that stuff's", "69:17", "enhancing them and this this period of", "69:19", "two million years is like a pretty", "69:21", "profound jump for the human brain sighs", "69:23", "they think some of that also came to do", "69:25", "with our desire to kill things with with", "69:27", "weapons but once we started hunting and", "69:30", "eating meat we got way more protein more", "69:32", "bioavailable protein all it was", "69:34", "healthier for the animal for the human", "69:36", "animal and then we also started to try", "69:38", "to figure out other better ways to kill", "69:40", "these animals which made it even more", "69:42", "creative and competitive yeah yeah and", "69:44", "they think that all this these all these", "69:46", "factors might have taken place that", "69:48", "turned us into a person that's pretty", "69:51", "amazing two million years yeah it's just", "69:52", "like a deviation well you know it's 65", "69:56", "million years ago we were like a mole oh", "69:58", "yeah people will like a little shrew", "70:01", "that's all that's right I remember that", "70:04", "what's the name of that thing I think", "70:06", "it's sort of Norfolk errific good trick",

I that's one way", "72:34", "thinking of it God a collective", "72:36", "consciousness whatever you want to call", "72:37", "it like that that intervention or the", "72:40", "the ability to see or sense that", "72:42", "expansiveness of that collective", "72:44", "intelligence could be attributed to God", "72:48", "so therefore you could say well I was", "72:50", "never apply was like well yeah you are", "72:52", "from that", "72:52", "what created you was something more", "72:55", "cosmic so and if if that's even true", "72:58", "well I was reading a quote today from", "73:01", "that someone was mocking from Piers", "73:02", "Morgan we was talking about the unit", "73:05", "like atheists and not knowing what", "73:09", "happened before the Big Bang not knowing", "73:11", "how no

can believe this", "75:45", "you can believe anything well I think I", "75:47", "said it I said it in a paraphrase achill", "75:50", "way that's basically the same thing he's", "75:52", "um you know yeah saying look it's all", "75:54", "it's all knots man yeah I mean my thing", "75:58", "is like I think I like to think of it as", "76:01", "in simulation terms and in in the sense", "76:04", "that if thinking of like reality the way", "76:07", "it's perceiving the way that we move", "76:08", "through it is a kind of a designed game", "76:10", "of sorts mm-hm and so if I think of it", "76:14", "in that way like nothing and something", "76:17", "nothing in something that's just kind of", "76:19", "that's the core of our reality right we", "76:21", "live in a binary reality everything is a", "76:23", "complex assortment of binaries that add", "76:26", "up into a really complex system right in", "76:29", "a way so what do you think it's moving", "76:30", "towards well think about that well", "76:32", "that's that's the thing I think that", "76:33", "part of the rules or what makes it hard", "76:36", "to rationalize like nothingness or or", "76:42", "something very very fantastic is just", "76:45", "because it because it's binary we are", "76:48", "binary in our thought process so it's", "76:50", "hard for us to not think of things in a", "76:52", "binary way so we think other was a", "76:54", "beginning no there was an ending there", "76:56", "was a beginning there's an ending but", "76:57", "really it's infinite it's like it's", "76:59", "paradox right it's everything and", "77:01", "nothing simultaneously hmm and and the", "77:04", "absence of which but but I've I guess", "77:07", "what I'm saying is that the idea that", "77:08", "things are infinite that reality is", "77:11", "infinite it's kind of a good way but", "77:13", "kind of can be scary but a good way to", "77:15", "think of it because it doesn't make any", "77:19", "sense", "77:20", "wouldn't be it seems like we have a", "77:22", "limited way of viewing what reality is", "77:24", "and I think we're limited by a binary", "77:26", "thought processes", "77:27", "I guess well it's also interesting that", "77:29", "we want to put any sort of limitations", "77:31", "on the universe and that yeah its", "77:33", "immense size isn't crazy enough for us", "77:39", "we could look at what we know right if", "77:43", "we know that the universe has hundreds", "77:45", "of billions of galaxies like just", "77:47", "there's a bunch of competing theories as", "77:49", "to what happens you know with black", "77:51", "holes and whether or not there's", "77:52", "multiverses there's a bunch of theories", "77:54", "right yes right but one of the most", "77:56", "profound ones that it was ever explained", "77:57", "to me is that there's a supermassive", "77:59", "black hole in the center of every galaxy", "78:01", "and it's exactly I think 1/2 of 1% of", "78:05", "the mass the entire galaxy oh really so", "78:08", "the bigger galaxies have bigger", "78:10", "supermassive black holes and the concept", "78:13", "is that is there is a real possibility", "78:18", "that going through that black hole you", "78:21", "would encounter an entirely different", "78:22", "universe with hundreds of billions of", "78:25", "galaxies each galaxy have a black hole", "78:28", "in the center of it go through that", "78:29", "black hole an entirely different", "78:31", "universe so each one s universe when you", "78:35", "have hundreds of billions of galaxies", "78:37", "there are hundreds of billions of", "78:39", "universes through those black holes and", "78:41", "each one of those galaxies or each one", "78:44", "of those universes has also hundreds of", "78:47", "billions of galaxies and each one of", "78:49", "those has a black hole you go through", "78:51", "that hundreds of billions of galaxies", "78:53", "that the whole thing fractal exactly", "78:56", "just like this cubes happening there's a", "78:58", "resistance come on yeah there's a thing", "79:01", "like an instant reaction to resist that", "79:03", "notion as if the universe itself isn't", "79:05", "already the most incredible thing of", "79:08", "magic right I know what do you care if", "79:10", "it's infinite why is it why would you", "79:11", "even resist that well because that's the", "79:13", "part of the binary thinking it's like I", "79:14", "want something to have an end it's like", "79:16", "it's a it's a way for us to survive but", "79:19", "like you know it's like oh there's an", "79:20", "end to that that creates a a need to", "79:24", "survive but when you think of things in", "79:26", "an abstract way like well if something", "79:27", "is just infinite infinite infinite and", "79:29", "what does that mean about us it's like", "79:31", "that's the question", "79:32", "that's the thing to explore because then", "79:34", "you have to renegotiate or your your", "79:37", "relationship to reality yeah which is", "79:39", "pretty sick we have at least we'd like", "79:41", "to take comfort in the idea that the", "79:43", "universe has at least there's a certain", "79:45", "parameter to it I know now it's 14", "79:48", "billion light years and that's it no", "79:50", "more no marker as if you can even", "79:52", "understand what 14 billion light is", "79:55", "there's no way it could be that number", "79:56", "it seems more like 19 but whatever that", "79:59", "number is you know they don't say the", "80:01", "way Cox explained it to me yeah that you", "80:04", "and I believe Sean Carroll explained it", "80:05", "this way as well there's a real dis real", "80:08", "lack of understanding about what goes", "80:10", "beyond that because it takes a certain", "80:13", "amount of time for light to even get to", "80:15", "us yeah and that time that that the", "80:18", "light doesn't move fast enough to reach", "80:21", "us from further events yeah so I give", "80:24", "you had something from like 200 billion", "80:27", "light years ago but maybe the light", "80:29", "would even get to us yet yeah there's", "80:31", "things that yeah I mean we're living in", "80:33", "a siphoning yeah I mean that's when you", "80:36", "see that's the other mind fuck when", "80:38", "you're looking this guy and you're", "80:40", "seeing a galaxy or of any sort of star", "80:43", "like in the deep deep deep distance of", "80:45", "space yeah the fucking light coming from", "80:48", "that thing left a million years ago yeah", "80:51", "right now way more you're literally just", "80:54", "looking at the past what is it if you", "80:56", "had imagined what is the closest star to", "80:59", "our star in the seeable universe when", "81:04", "you look up into the night sky", "81:06", "we think the Darla's star how is that a", "81:08", "star sometimes things are called stars", "81:10", "but they're planets from old-school", "81:12", "times oh and I could be wrong if you had", "81:15", "a guess was the closest how many my", "81:17", "office in sorry I don't know that's how", "81:20", "straight I sent or is it how much is it", "81:23", "how far was that or 4.3 light years from", "81:27", "Earth wow that's too bad that's a hop", "81:29", "skip and a jump if you go the speed of", "81:31", "light take you 40 yeah it's like the", "81:33", "Hawaii of outer space that like they go", "81:35", "there and there's a pit stop there", "81:37", "before they come to earth and the aliens", "81:38", "come they want to chill I", "81:45", "oh shit some use for breaking not really", "81:49", "it's a binary pair so I imagine that", "81:53", "means that they move yeah each other", "81:54", "they orbit around each other there's", "81:55", "technically a third star Proxima", "81:57", "Centauri which is because it says those", "82:00", "are an average of 4.3 this one's 4.2 -", "82:02", "so it's well Nikoli close they're nice", "82:04", "in an average so two are closer than the", "82:08", "one on one day now do they know if", "82:09", "there's planets around those stars so", "82:12", "they they didn't even know there were", "82:15", "other planets for sure other than oh", "82:17", "isn't it crazy so just a couple decades", "82:19", "it's it's so amazing to me it's like", "82:21", "shining a flashlight in the ocean yeah", "82:23", "you know like that's what space is like", "82:25", "it's like you're removing a beam but", "82:27", "like things are constantly changing at", "82:29", "different distances and you can see", "82:31", "better under certain circumstances and", "82:33", "you can see at different times so like", "82:35", "it's kind of like a big existential", "82:36", "party you're like I think I'm making", "82:39", "sense of this and then there's all these", "82:41", "theories and then someone catches", "82:43", "another angle they're like no no I mean", "82:45", "yes a little bit of what you guys were", "82:46", "thinking but also this they're like fuck", "82:48", "and they just keep adding to it but I", "82:50", "don't know if we're gonna find", "82:51", "necessarily anything we talked to", "82:54", "physicists about the subject and they", "82:56", "try to explain to you how they even", "82:57", "reach these conclusions mm-hmm and how", "83:00", "they know that there's black holes out", "83:01", "there in the first place and the a", "83:03", "theories fucking like these these these", "83:07", "theories of multiverses and yeah that's", "83:10", "my favorite and brains the membranes", "83:12", "that there's like yeah mmm theory like", "83:14", "lines of universes then we collide with", "83:16", "each other again yeah fuck that's what I", "83:19", "think goes sorry by the way which was", "83:22", "like in interest it was it interstellar", "83:24", "yeah with Matthew Modine is that the", "83:27", "star or the Russian training with the", "83:38", "log", "83:38", "yeah I'm just Aris yes

"on film right we like that look yeah we", "106:49", "did we like the things that are in the", "106:51", "forefront focus but everything in the", "106:53", "back is just like yeah Clary and fuzzy", "106:55", "that's true it's got this like quality", "106:57", "thing to it even though now we see", "106:59", "videos that are very literal from phones", "107:00", "all the time we see that kind of imagery", "107:02", "we still don't necessarily see you", "107:06", "wouldn't see that in a movie theater", "107:07", "necessarily you to to distracted by all", "107:11", "the outside images so if you're talking", "107:13", "differently you and I are talking I'm", "107:14", "focusing on you I know there's some", "107:16", "stuff over to the left and stuff over", "107:18", "the right but I'm not seeing it the same", "107:19", "way I'm seeing you yes right that's one", "107:21", "of the reasons why like when you", "107:23", "interpret video like you visually", "107:25", "interpret video it's a very weird", "107:27", "distortion even though it's the most", "107:28", "accurate representation because you", "107:31", "can't look at everything at the same", "107:32", "time so if you look at a photograph and", "107:34", "everything is in focus what kind of what", "107:36", "are you using what are you using to see", "107:38", "things with exist my eyes don't work", "107:39", "like that yeah I'm actually looking at", "107:41", "you and everything around you like I", "107:43", "know there's a clock right here but I'm", "107:45", "dude I can't even read what time it is", "107:46", "it's right there I can't get it but yeah", "107:48", "I can read it right yeah okay you know", "107:50", "this stuff that's just a few inches to", "107:53", "your left or right and I literally can't", "107:55", "see them yes just a tiny tiny point that", "107:57", "you're actually focusing on yeah just", "107:59", "focus on right in front of these things", "108:00", "yeah from the face so let's make that", "108:02", "make sense like for focus it kind of", "108:03", "replicates the way that and it's also a", "108:05", "storytelling mechanism right focus on", "108:07", "this part you know", "108:08", "yes it definitely is that yeah but it", "108:10", "also it's like it looks cooler", "108:11", "it just looks yeah it looks at the hope", "108:14", "it looks Pro you know it's it's high-res", "108:16", "yeah maybe like a video camera like a", "108:19", "regular standard consumer grade video", "108:21", "camera almost takes clearer pictures oh", "108:25", "for sure yeah it's it's like if you ever", "108:28", "put your phone in time-lapse mode yes it", "108:30", "looks like the way it tracks when you're", "108:33", "moving it over objects it's got a higher", "108:34", "frame rate or something like that but it", "108:37", "makes it look like that pan and scan", "108:39", "shit you know when you're watching", "108:40", "sports or whatever and it just looks", "108:43", "wrong you know like it's too literal", "108:46", "there's something to the way everything", "108:48", "moves just feels slightly off do you", "108:51", "think that we're just accustomed to the", "108:53", "way film looks and then if we were", "108:56", "accustomed to the way video looks then a", "108:59", "film would be look clunky to us well you", "109:02", "have everything started off as video and", "109:04", "then they said you know what it's not", "109:05", "really good to have everything in focus", "109:06", "uh-huh it's only good to have some", "109:08", "things and focus in the back way some", "109:09", "things are blurry and then they come", "109:10", "into focus and actually enhances the", "109:12", "filmmaking yes right yes like in a", "109:14", "horror movie yes but something's blurry", "109:16", "and then they zoom in on it and you see", "109:18", "it's like a fucking monster hiding under", "109:20", "the bed oh yeah no that's not what I", "109:22", "didn't want that to happen you've now", "109:24", "just revealed exactly what I didn't want", "109:26", "to see yeah yeah no I agree yeah I don't", "109:29", "know I mean I don't know but I know that", "109:31", "do you know people like film I think it", "109:33", "just looks it's the texture of it but", "109:35", "now people like DV well it's like people", "109:37", "like vinyl right there's people that are", "109:39", "just diehard vinyl fans they like to", "109:41", "sound yeah I mean you know I like I like", "109:44", "I like anything you know but I'd like to", "109:46", "I'd like to make sure that it's the best", "109:49", "quality of it or the most natural use", "109:53", "case for it you know you know it's like", "109:56", "when people used to mix when people", "109:58", "started listening more to music in their", "110:00", "car that they could like put a thing", "110:02", "that they bought in their car with an", "110:03", "eight-track or whatever where they used", "110:05", "to have record players for cars too but", "110:07", "you know the way that music sounded they", "110:11", "were kind of they also had to consider", "110:12", "the mix of car speakers what does it", "110:15", "sound like on car speakers so going back", "110:17", "to the aura tones and the NS tends", "110:20", "and then the standardized car speakers", "110:22", "that people test audio and then ride and", "110:24", "it's a different parameter right because", "110:26", "you're stuck in this little contained", "110:28", "metal box yeah yeah so you got to figure", "110:30", "out how to mix the music but generally", "110:32", "it's the sound system that has to be", "110:34", "adjusted mmm the sound systems have to", "110:36", "but you mix to say they kind of meet", "110:38", "each other in the middle but great hi-fi", "110:39", "systems might actually it's a quick", "110:42", "anecdote but when I was in Seattle I", "110:45", "knew that I liked hi-fi systems but I", "110:49", "didn't know why they were so expensive", "110:52", "and so I went into this place this guy", "110:55", "named Leland who was working there was", "110:57", "kind of friends with him because I'd", "110:58", "come in and I just scoped gear all the", "110:59", "time just looking like I loved audio", "111:01", "gear it's just really sweet and and then", "111:04", "one day it was towards the end when they", "111:06", "were closing and he turns to me and says", "111:08", "hey man do you want to get your brain", "111:10", "fried and I was like what do you mean", "111:12", "and he's like stick around okay and he", "111:14", "closed shop couple of his friends came", "111:16", "in close the shop it's like maybe five", "111:18", "of us went into the back room smoked", "111:21", "some marijuana went into the show room", "111:24", "the main room where they have all the", "111:25", "speakers and all the different types of", "111:27", "units and he says then he kind of turns", "111:30", "to us we all sat down and couch and he", "111:31", "says okay you're gonna listen to a this", "111:33", "is a system in total it costs about one", "111:36", "hundred and fifty thousand dollars whoa", "111:37", "and and then he just goes proceed Singh", "111:40", "goes through and explains all of the", "111:42", "stages that you know that the current is", "111:45", "going through and what the music is", "111:46", "going through what's being played on all", "111:48", "the cables that are being used all this", "111:49", "stuff and then I heard all of that crazy", "111:52", "speakers like okay cool he lowers the", "111:54", "lights and he puts on a Bill Evans trio", "111:57", "record I can't remember which one", "112:00", "and he just presses play and we sit down", "112:04", "and like within probably thirty Seconds", "112:06", "people were crying Wow and because it", "112:10", "felt holographic it felt like you were", "112:12", "in the room with those musicians that", "112:16", "were playing right there for you and", "112:18", "then I had the realization it's not the", "112:20", "money it's not about the money it's", "112:22", "about what does it take to engineer a", "112:24", "machine that becomes invisible to the", "112:27", "experience and that was that kind of", "112:30", "blew my mind so whenever you're", "112:32", "designing anything it's like", "112:33", "designing experience engineering should", "112:36", "yeah should should get the fuck out of", "112:37", "the way", "112:38", "what was the medium was it vinyl vinyl", "112:42", "yeah yeah what do you think like in your", "112:46", "description what is different about", "112:48", "vinyl well I mean supposedly if you have", "112:52", "a really nice quality piece of violence", "112:55", "cut really well you get as close to the", "113:00", "original mastered recording experience", "113:03", "like coming out of the studio if you're", "113:05", "talking about older tape so whatever", "113:08", "that final mix is when someone plays it", "113:10", "they're like it's been mastered here's", "113:12", "the stereo two-track we're playing the", "113:14", "stereo two-track it's been mastered that", "113:16", "excuse me I'm a little wheezy and and", "113:19", "that's what you hear you hear it in the", "113:21", "best possible context on the speakers", "113:23", "that it was mixed on it's everything's", "113:25", "optimal so essentially when a record is", "113:27", "pressed if it can mimic that the stereo", "113:30", "to track the master which it does then", "113:35", "you have something that for at least the", "113:37", "first I don't know vinyl people will say", "113:40", "how many times but a record starts to", "113:43", "wear down but if you have a fresh press", "113:44", "you can run it a bunch of times before", "113:46", "it starts to degrade but in that state", "113:48", "you're hearing it like analogue super", "113:50", "analog it's like how many times you", "113:52", "think you play it before it starts", "113:54", "degrade I don't know I guess it depends", "113:56", "on the ears of the audiophile but", "113:57", "there's probably an average I don't know", "113:59", "what it would be maybe 60 or 30 Oh 50", "114:02", "times now is there a digital format that", "114:04", "at least comes close oh yeah yeah FLAC", "114:08", "files what is a it's a file format black", "114:12", "files are good usually 128 96 kilohertz", "114:20", "like that's there's like kind of", "114:22", "mastering the digital mastering standard", "114:24", "and that standard is is basically what", "114:28", "that is what a record is so that's why", "114:30", "you have like sites like HD tracks that", "114:32", "I really dig you can get all your", "114:35", "favorite out well not all it's not as", "114:37", "big of a selection but you can get full", "114:39", "resolution from like stereo two-track", "114:43", "master from the studio level quality in", "114:45", "a digital format", "114:47", "that you can buy and then put into a", "114:49", "high-risk player so I have a high-res", "114:50", "player a hi-fi player and it runs the it", "114:53", "has really nice circuitry and all that", "114:55", "stuff and then use a really great pair", "114:57", "of headphones and you've got the closest", "114:59", "thing to a record that's repeatable", "115:00", "infinite times and is the headphones the", "115:03", "way to go or one of those crazy Tower", "115:05", "speaker jammies the way to go huh well", "115:07", "it depends on your use case like if you", "115:09", "if you nephew here in a house and you", "115:11", "want like a cool living room system or", "115:14", "whatever I would always opt for speakers", "115:16", "and not not Sonos and not that kind of", "115:19", "stuff people they dig it but true", "115:23", "I mean records are meant to be played", "115:24", "off of two speakers with it's a 2.1 so", "115:27", "unless it's specifically engineered", "115:29", "which
