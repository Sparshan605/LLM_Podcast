with his footwork in", "06:36", "movement", "06:37", "it was actually becoming a disadvantage", "06:39", "because you you were using that against", "06:42", "him you were you you found the angles",

mimic just like Dahmer there were", "08:09", "just a little faster than Dominick and I", "08:11", "knew that I was even trying to touch his", "08:13", "face because I knew that he was a hard", "08:15", "hit but I also knew that he would leave", "08:17", "his legs a lot you know you can you can", "08:20", "push your body backwards but your legs", "08:22", "will always be in that same position so", "08:25", "the whole game plan since the beginning", "08:26", "this is why I felt so confident that", "08:27", "fight the training was to continue just", "08:30", "keep taking his legs out as much as I", "08:33", "can", "08:33", "did the first round of your fight with", "08:35", "Marlon Moriah sort of open your eyes to", "08:37", "like how effective that can be in a", "08:40",

you mentioned", "08:47", "it because a lot of people don't see", "08:49", "those little", "08:49", "tells those cap kicks when you start to", "08:51", "take out that lead leg minute you lose",

years", "09:04", "or so I give credit events in Henderson", "09:06", "because Benson Henderson was the first", "09:08", "guy to really bring it to MMA but for", "09:10", "whatever reason it wasn't as devastating", "09:12", "when he was doing it I don't know if he", "09:13", "was doing it differently but there was", "09:15", "no moment in the fight where he kicked", "09:17", "someone's calf and you saw immediately", "09:18", "them buckling but you're seeing that now", "09:20", "with these guys like immediately one-two", "09:23", "kicks and their leg is semi useless yeah", "09:26", "you look at somebody like just engaging", "09:28", "just a chi is many people don't catch on", "09:31", "to that if kabhi don't catch on to that", "09:33", "and he's in trouble I know I'm both he", "09:36", "said why", "09:37", "like white out in the open he said when", "09:39", "I fight Kobe because I'm not even gonna", "09:41", "try to kick him in his dies I'm just", "09:42", "gonna kick him with that low calf kick", "09:43", "he goes I'm gonna kick him four times he", "09:46", "goes after four times he's fucked yeah", "09:48", "and he saw that you watched the fight", "09:50", "with him and Edson Barboza", "09:51", "that's a boss he's a high-level striker", "09:53", "but what really broke down at him", "09:56", "Barbosa was what Justin did till he", "09:59", "started whipping that that that calf", "10:01", "kick and actually right before I even", "10:02", "fought Dominic like I went on YouTube my", "10:05", "goose was like maybe an hour before I", "10:07", "went to the arena and I just put like", "10:09", "some just engage he highlights just", "10:11", "ruthless man just really just swinging", "10:14", "those kids with bad intentions all was", "10:16", "just to murder yeah and also the reason", "10:19", "why I've been able to kick and do things", "10:20", "like that cause I'm very confident on my", "10:22", "takedown defense you know it's like John", "10:25", "Jones John Jones is so comfortable with", "10:27", "the standard because he knows his", "10:28", "ability to stop something from taking", "10:30", "them down they're just so much higher", "10:32", "you know and I feel that same way so I", "10:34", "become a little more free with my kicks", "10:36", "and punches and things of that matter we", "10:38", "saw two guys in one of the weight", "10:40", "classes that you ruled over Alex Perez", "10:42", "and jucier Formiga this past weekend and", "10:44", "Alex Perez stopped him with those low", "10:46", "leg kicks to ufc's in a row we've seen", "10:49", "guys get stopped with low leg kicks it's", "10:52", "crazy it's crazy how prominent that that", "10:54", "that technique has become it has it has", "10:57", "and I think", "10:59", "we're gonna start seeing more of it", "11:00", "mm-hmm so people are gonna have to start", "11:02", "adjusting that because there is what was", "11:03", "that there's two stoppages within uh", "11:05", "there's a stoppage before Alex Perez", "11:07", "recently that came out yeah last week", "11:09", "last week of this style forget who who", "11:11", "was fighting but um it was another", "11:14", "stoppage because leg fix in that", "11:15", "stoppage the dude crushed both of his", "11:18", "legs so I apologize for not remembering", "11:19", "the names I'm over I didn't call that", "11:22", "fight either yeah I called it our our", "11:24", "remembrance but the the low leg kick is", "11:27", "just a gigantic factor when you were", "11:29", "fighting Marlin more eyes I mean it", "11:32", "seemed like he was a bit of a step ahead", "11:35", "of you in the first round but you made", "11:38", "some serious adjustments in which mean", "11:40", "it was like two different fights it was", "11:41", "like the first round was like damn this", "11:42", "is not going well for Henry and then", "11:44", "going in the second round like damn this", "11:46", "is not going well for Marlin like you it", "11:48", "was a totally different fight it's like", "11:49", "you figured the adjustment out figured", "11:51", "out what you need to do you stepped in", "11:52", "further you were closer and you start", "11:54", "attacking yeah and I think a lot of that", "11:57", "to Joe and if if I was I know how to I", "12:01", "know when to fight and when to compete", "12:02", "and when Marlin first I went in there", "12:06", "with the sprained ankle this is why I", "12:07", "had my like my my ankle tape tape and", "12:10", "actually Marlins team had heard me", "12:12", "scream on Tuesday night when all this", "12:15", "happened so they knew I was somewhat", "12:16", "injured so I think their game plan when", "12:18", "did you scream I twisted my ankle", "12:21", "between the UFC mats like do you know", "12:23", "that has some cheap tape and then", "12:24", "between the mats when I stepped in like", "12:26", "my I rolled my ankle like bad bad I have", "12:29", "pictures of it's like black and blue but", "12:34", "I still wanted to fight so you know so", "12:38", "anyway so you know I went in there hurt", "12:40", "or whatnot but I knew that that first", "12:42", "round and you said you mentioned it too", "12:43", "during the fight says I think this might", "12:45", "be a survivor round for Henry now and it", "12:47", "absolutely was so I knew went to", "12:48", "fighting went to compete but I also knew", "12:51", "that Marlin was throwing so much power", "12:53", "and I've gone I've gone against some of", "12:56", "the best in the world there's like dude", "12:57", "there's no way he's gonna be able to", "12:58", "maintain all that power for five rounds", "13:02", "and I don't think this kid has any idea", "13:04", "as a wrestler because never rusts before", "13:06", "how much pain a guy like me can endure", "13:09", "so he can say he was tired he can say", "13:11", "that", "13:12", "something happened but in reality it's a", "13:14", "mixture of two things he blew his wad", "13:16", "and this guy this guy here could uh", "13:19", "which is me could take a lot of pot", "13:21", "could take a lot of pain that was with", "13:23", "Mike not too long ago and I asked him I", "13:25", "was like I was like I was like hey Mike", "13:27", "this is Mike Tyson I'm like would whoa", "13:29", "whoa how would you describe Muhammad Ali", "13:32", "man what was different between him and", "13:33", "everybody else and he sat there and he", "13:36", "thought about in his life which was cool", "13:39", "to hear man because I can I can put", "13:41", "myself in in those shoes and he's like", "13:43", "he's like man Muhammad Ali was a guy", "13:47", "that I've never seen before because he", "13:49", "could just endure so much pain mmm like", "13:52", "they do could just endure so much pain", "13:54", "that it's almost like the average guy", "13:56", "would fold the average that guy would", "13:58", "probably get killed but all he just had", "13:59", "a certain will to him that's separating", "14:03", "him from from everybody else it was the", "14:06", "fact that he was able to endure pain you", "14:08", "don't hear that too often", "14:09", "it's true though you know I mean if you", "14:11", "watch his fight with Ken Norton you know", "14:12", "he fought most of the fight with a", "14:14", "broken jaw yeah I mean this is heavy", "14:17",

out I", "86:19", "get checked yeah really yeah it's it's", "86:23", "done every time during cap you know my", "86:25", "mic my coach captain Eric al Barisan", "86:27", "he's uh we've been able to simulate and", "86:30", "emulate everything that we that we're", "86:32", "gonna do in a fight like if you on my", "86:33", "training like my training is not me", "86:36", "doing jiu-jitsu for two hours and then I", "86:38", "do boxing like no no I'm in their place", "86:41", "sparring seeing what I'm doing good in", "86:43", "place barn and then adjusting what I saw", "86:46", "in place point with the coaches", "86:47", "individually and then I'm giving 20", "86:50", "minutes to my two to that and then I", "86:52", "give twenty minutes to my striking with", "86:54", "PAD work or it could be with the partner", "86:56", "but I'm going the whole time you see", "86:58", "what I'm saying so I'm collaborating", "87:00", "everything together simulating the fight", "87:02", "as much as possible being being very", "87:05", "detailed in my training and then when it", "87:07", "comes to sparring that's that's the real", "87:09", "deal that's where I have to shine and", "87:10", "that's how I show myself out good I'm", "87:12", "becoming are you using are you taking", "87:15", "notes like how are you keeping track of", "87:17", "your progress are you just knowing in", "87:19", "your

I need a rest another 2 3", "87:31", "hours before I go train today guys mmm", "87:33", "you know what I'm saying that it's a", "87:34", "very selfish style training and that's a", "87:40", "big advantage yeah it's it's I am giving", "87:43", "a lot of knowledge he meant but this is", "87:45", "you know that's who I am and I want to", "87:46", "share what I have I don't I've never", "87:48",

we train for Dominic", "88:13", "this last camp that I have was like the", "88:14", "best this kept that I had with Dominic", "88:17", "was like the best fight that uh the best", "88:20", "if I cam I've ever had man like the best", "88:22", "because I've I learned from like", "88:24", "everything that I've done and I've it's", "88:26", "almost like I've build this team like I", "88:28", "don't I'm not from a team necessarily", "88:29", "but I build this team around me", "88:31", "according to every opponent that I fight", "88:33", "so everybody's moving and everybody's", "88:35", "mimicking Dominick Cruz and vice versa", "88:37", "for TJ for Marlon like it's and these", "88:40", "are being compensated these are being", "88:42", "paid you know what I'm saying so it's", "88:43", "like it's a real business not just hey", "88:46", "just go out there and sparring Brian", "88:47", "try try everything that you do it's like", "88:50", "that that's to me that's that's like", "88:52", "it's

"89:11", "a wrestler which I love there's things", "89:13", "in wrestling that doesn't work and", "89:14", "boxing it's the distance is different", "89:16", "like all this so you almost have to", "89:17", "mimic everything that you do hmm", "89:19", "in a very technical sense so when you do", "89:22", "this are you wearing normal four ounce", "89:25", "gloves the whole deal no they're more", "89:27", "like the sparring gloves like the real", "89:30", "ones yeah because you don't want to I", "89:31", "mean have you fuck with any of those", "89:32", "onyx MMA gloves I've ever felt once", "89:40", "these guys decide to truly launch and", "89:42", "whatnot like I think that company could", "89:44", "could completely take over like that", "89:46", "that's what I'm saying they make the", "89:47", "best shit dude he's such a mad man about", "89:49", "it - Trevor was on the podcast with", "89:51", "Justin and describing his process of", "89:53", "making those gloves he got me a pair of", "89:56", "them and he let me try on those MMA ones", "89:58", "when you compare them to the UFC one", "89:59", "side to side like what yeah this is", "90:02", "these are crazy good there's so much", "90:04", "better there's so well designed like", "90:06", "everything about it Matt yeah so it's", "90:08", "engine", "90:09", "does the padding is better it's better", "90:10", "padding it

I'm I'm", "90:23", "saying bye to everybody and you mm it", "90:26", "feels so normal for me to compete you're", "90:28", "like it's it's crazy it really does for", "90:29", "like a sparring session that's so genius", "90:31", "that you reenact it every week every", "90:35", "week or sometimes you're cranking", "90:37", "sometimes you're pissed but that's even", "90:39", "part of how you're gonna filter in fight", "90:40", "week you don't meet NFL with my coach my", "90:42", "like it's crazy yeah Erik like it's like", "90:45", "Captain there cuz he's it's like man", "90:46", "we're like brothers like he's a coach", "90:47", "buddy's a brother buddy you know what", "90:49", "I'm saying right it simulates the fight", "90:51", "yeah it's beautiful", "90:53", "that's a genius idea man it really is", "90:56", "and so who's mapping out your training", "90:59", "camps like in terms of like when you do", "91:01", "strength conditioning when is it a", "91:03", "collaborative effort it's a", "91:05", "collaborative effort and a lot of it I I", "91:07", "have to pay attention to science so", "91:09", "there's things that my coach have to say", "91:10", "there are things that I have say but", "91:12", "it's truly like the science so in terms", "91:14", "of your recovery and yeah you know and", "91:16", "then what should I eat like everything's", "91:17", "calculated in how hard I'm gonna go like", "91:19", "this my Mills are prepped", "91:20", "according to everyday how hard I'm gonna", "91:22", "go really yeah so there's times I'm", "91:24", "doing fives where I'm not gonna eat like", "91:26", "like when I'm doing a ten during", "91:28", "sparring you know what I'm saying and", "91:29", "this is go with in terms of your", "91:31", "preparation like your pre-workout meals",

that's again a lot", "91:55", "of that stuff you would have to say", "91:56", "preference man personally I like to have", "91:58", "like a big big brunch and I know we have", "92:02", "yeah 2 o'clock so you give yourself like", "92:06", "five six hours yeah because your nerves", "92:09", "like it for some reason like your nerves", "92:10", "it's hard to digest your food when", "92:12", "you're nervous you know you're anxious", "92:14", "to do something so what kind of food do", "92:16", "you eat before you fight um", "92:18", "eggs pancakes", "92:21", "and obviously the carbs will not yeah", "92:23", "just I would just eat normal like bacon", "92:25", "like I you pretty clean throughout", "92:26", "throughout the whole camp but you don't", "92:28", "have like specific pre-fight meals and", "92:30", "no no but I think at that point is just", "92:33", "a psychology side of it you know what", "92:35", "I'm saying like I'm gonna eat what would", "92:37", "the serotonin in my mind like the", "92:38", "happiness in me what it wants you know", "92:41", "what I'm saying because I I'm I'm gonna", "92:43", "deserve it when I when I fight that", "92:45", "night you know what I'm

right after I beat him and", "92:58", "and and veggies like that was super", "93:00", "light but I had no fat in me and I got", "93:02", "you know I got put out and I love them", "93:05", "and I owe that you have to have every", "93:07", "stone you have to you know turn every", "93:09", "stone man because there's a lot of", "93:11", "details man it's very complex man and if", "93:13", "you can understand the game and on the", "93:15", "recovery on the nutrition on the", "93:17", "happiness on on the preparation on the", "93:19", "game planning all that I mean who so let", "93:23", "me ask you this who is this company that", "93:26", "puts these meals together they're basing", "93:29", "it on when you say like yes it depends", "93:31", "upon the workout like how are they how", "93:34", "are they doing that well speaking to the", "93:36", "physiologist zero-force it's crazy yeah", "93:39", "so it's almost like there's a team of I", "93:43", "shout out to them to my friends kitchen", "93:45", "there's a team of of man maybe twelve", "93:50", "people man there's a guy that goes in", "93:53", "there every time I fight and he's", "93:55", "monitoring my heart rate every time I", "93:57", "can he say slow down slow down", "94:00", "and he'll tell the coach and the coaches", "94:02", "will tell me like it's all there's a", "94:04", "dude in there warming me up before I go", "94:06", "train like at my gym like a personal", "94:08", "trainer every single day do they give", "94:10", "you anything specifically right after", "94:11", "you're done training to sort of recovery", "94:14", "anything for like replenish glycogen", "94:16", "yeah yeah so that's immediately what is", "94:19", "it you can I get you can every what is", "94:21", "that it's it's just it's

crossed in every", "94:34", "eyes", "94:35", "it's all down to the science yeah it's", "94:37", "fun really interesting I think if I have", "94:39", "a gift and anything so I really I've", "94:40", "never seen myself coach Joe I think", "94:42", "being a coach is I think being a coach", "94:46", "is probably the hardest job man cuz you", "94:48", "got to deal with pride and then you get", "94:49", "and sometimes they leave you or not but", "94:50", "if anyways if there's one thing that I", "94:52", "could do and help people with as if I", "94:55", "was a coach would be game planning", "94:57", "actually putting like a game plan", "94:58", "together and understanding and putting", "95:00", "it putting a solid team together when", "95:02", "did you start doing this thing where you", "95:04", "would emulate your opponent's walk out", "95:06", "music and your walk out music and the", "95:08", "whole deal since we started since we", "95:10", "fought Demetrius and since I started", "95:12", "having success actually since Wilson", "95:13", "Hayes so I see what I lost had been", "95:16", "abused I thought Wilson Hayes in this", "95:17", "since there and then it got a little", "95:18", "more serious when the funn Demetrius and", "95:20", "then so forth we just got better better", "95:22", "throughout camp so that was when you", "95:25", "decided okay we're gonna make some", "95:26", "wholesale changes and this is a big one", "95:28", "we're gonna reenact is it your idea to", "95:30", "do it that way I had to I had no choice", "95:32", "yeah people said I mean your idea to", "95:33", "introduce the fighter and have you", "95:35", "introduced and the whole deal have the", "95:36", "walkout music no a lot of that was my", "95:38", "coach and then a lot of its me like", "95:40", "alright well let's take it to a next", "95:42", "level I put me in the back hey so who do", "95:44", "up in five yeah you know what I'm saying", "95:47", "right and I've noticed that since I've", "95:49", "done that show like it's been like dude", "95:51", "I feel like I'm walking out there why so", "95:52", "who are getting so better dude it's the", "95:54", "comfort of how I feel my like it's a", "95:57", "it's a tactical thing that we developed", "95:59", "yeah you yeah you've figured out a way", "96:02", "to make it a normal part of your life", "96:04", "exactly that's a big thing about", "96:06", "fighters returning right that taking a", "96:08", "long time off and then coming back it's", "96:09", "very difficult because everything feels", "96:11", "weird", "96:11", "right yeah I remember they were talking", "96:15", "about that with Sugar Ray Leonard when", "96:17", "Sugar Ray Leonard was in the process of", "96:19", "making one of his comebacks then one of", "96:21", "the things they did is they put together", "96:22", "might have been for the hack or fight", "96:24", "they put together fights in the gym like", "96:28", "that a real fight in the gym so it just", "96:29", "get used to it like you would fight", "96:31", "twelve rounds in the gym yeah I guess is", "96:34", "it I guess you go back to at all it's", "96:37", "hot you're simulating man it's not me", "96:40", "but but this is a thing the biggest", "96:42", "problem that I've seen because I've gone", "96:43", "through a lot of coaches now is getting", "96:45", "all the coaches on the same page then", "96:47", "getting all the coaches", "96:48", "you know getting them to commit on", "96:51", "science is that all your response you", "96:53", "have to handle everybody here to someone", "96:54", "no sure yeah yeah captain captain does", "96:57", "Aikido he does all that and you know not", "97:00", "just that but even like for me it's like", "97:02", "stem cells I'm like I did stem cells in", "97:04", "Colombia with Bao accelerator out in", "97:06", "Colombia about six months ago right", "97:09", "through my fighting man I felt so good", "97:11", "for this vise I have a jacked-up neck", "97:13", "stem cells like they did a whole you", "97:16", "know they did they did all the scans you", "97:18", "could think of you know from x-rays to", "97:19", "MRIs and whatnot and you know they would", "97:22", "pinpoint like were Mike my body was was", "97:26", "an ache and they started injecting stem", "97:29", "cells on me mad all over my neck much of", "97:31", "my body that I've never experienced", "97:33", "before and immediately my neck started", "97:36", "like the same almost the same day man my", "97:39", "neck started feeling better and ever", "97:40", "since then and ever since then I I think", "97:43", "three months into it I man and my neck", "97:46", "was 100% man I've wrestled my whole life", "97:48", "Wow if I neck jacked up", "97:50", "so many
