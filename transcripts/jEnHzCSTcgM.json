"must have thought that we jumped off", "05:35", "with parachutes and we because they", "05:38", "couldn't find us and then I was like", "05:40", "yeah this seems pretty clear and then", "05:42", "every single light on the tower the", "05:46", "whole thing lights up and this isn't", "05:48", "like the twinkly lights that they have", "05:50", "on every hour at night this is like", "05:52",
