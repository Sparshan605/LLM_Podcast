"09:36", "like the fuck you doing here but I hate", "09:38", "like we sit in on well anyways I don't", "09:41", "know what you just said there was a", "09:43", "there was during the negotiations right", "09:45", "between the the the crown and the ospc a", "09:48", "for the town yeah the crown that's the", "09:50", "one who would be laying the charges the", "09:51", "animal cruelty charge so you get charged", "09:53", "okay what is the crown what are the the", "09:56", "crown is like the is the justice he's", "09:57", "like the essentially the judge here", "09:59", "before the judge he doesn't wear one but", "10:06", "okay so so it's like crown land and no", "10:09", "crown land it's public land yeah so", "10:11", "right so I imagine that's probably in", "10:13", "sort of capacity why it's called crown I", "10:16", "don't know I'm not a legal expert but", "10:17", "nonetheless so they're in there", "10:19", "negotiating and basically the way animal", "10:22", "cruelty charges are our pursued is they", "10:25", "have to meet two thresholds number one", "10:27", "you have to have a reasonable chance of", "10:31", "conviction number two it has to be in", "10:34", "the public's interest to pursue a series", "10:36", "of the first charges were immediately", "10:38", "dropped because and this is since just", "10:41", "driving me crazy for years that this has", "10:43", "been going on it continues but if I for", "10:46", "instance if I make a complaint to the", "10:47", "ospc and I provide a photo of an animal", "10:49", "which of course I did", "10:50", "that is clearly damaged and fucked up if", "10:53", "they don't physically have evidence of", "10:55", "who it is that's actually harming the", "10:57", "animal", "10:58", "there's no cruelty they can't do", "10:59", "anything so in that case they dropped a", "11:02", "lot of the charges against marie-line", "11:03", "because the evidence didn't actually", "11:04", "point to anyone specifically it was just", "11:06", "evidence", "11:07", "of damaged animals okay so they threw a", "11:09", "bunch of okay but then there was a bunch", "11:11", "that were that they did have a good", "11:13", "chance at a conviction and this is where", "11:15", "Marineland promised the crown that this", "11:17", "was going to be a very expensive process", "11:19", "long and drawn-out process and the crown", "11:21", "agreed that it didn't meet the threshold", "11:24", "it exceed the threshold of being in the", "11:26", "public public's interest in spending a", "11:28", "lot of public dollars pursuing these", "11:31", "charges and so they dropped the rest of", "11:33", "them Marineland turns around and Sue's", "11:35", "the OU SPCA for 21 million dollars", "11:36", "claiming that it was malicious", "11:39", "prosecution that of course they named", "11:41", "they didn't name me specifically but I'm", "11:43", "always the unnamed Marineland employee", "11:44", "in that and they alleged that I", "11:46", "threatened to defund them and all they", "11:48", "think I'm this Keyser s\u00f6ze like", "11:49", "character which I don't mind playing up", "11:50", "a little bit but they think I'm pulling", "11:52", "strings all over the place and that I", "11:53", "half exist half don't", "11:54", "I think there's employees there that", "11:55", "think that I'm like no so they they get", "12:00", "brought up on 11 charges of animal", "12:01", "cruelty the charges get dropped and they", "12:03", "turn around sue the government 21", "12:05", "million dollars the same government that", "12:07", "led them off for years the OU SPCA has", "12:09", "been complacent they're complicit in", "12:11", "sorting allowing Marineland to operate", "12:13", "as they have unimpeded for you know 50", "12:16", "50 years they've had a good relation", "12:17", "Marineland in fact donated the land of", "12:19", "which the Niagara Falls Humane Society", "12:22", "is is built on which is where the OU", "12:24", "SPCA operates on it they would learn", "12:26", "there was a plaque on the wall until you", "12:28", "know after 2012 and we started spoke out", "12:30", "that honored marine lands owner John", "12:32", "holder for his generosity yeah you sort", "12:35", "of get red pill is that red pills at the", "12:37", "right pill pretty when you it's the wake", "12:40", "up pill so that was my wait what moment", "12:42", "holy fuck thinks things started to", "12:45", "change pretty fast for me once I'd", "12:46", "realized the depth of which marine land", "12:48", "was sort of in with all levels of", "12:50", "government really all levels of", "12:52", "government and so they've you know they", "12:53", "continue to sort of allow for them to do", "12:55", "these things but but they're suing the", "12:57", "government yeah and we can't possibly be", "13:00", "in bed with the government and suing", "13:01", "them or the Canadian Association of zoos", "13:03", "and aquaria much used to accredit all", "13:06", "the zoos in Canada or still does they", "13:07", "accredit them so they try to they try to", "13:09", "say oh this is a good zoo it's", "13:11", "accredited Marineland", "13:13", "I believe also threatened them because", "13:16", "they were not going to renew their there", "13:19", "their agreement this year and so", "13:20", "Marineland claimed to have left them and", "13:23", "they said you know we're in the phase of", "13:25", "development right now we're gonna just", "13:27", "leave this Canadian Association of zoos", "13:29", "and aquaria", "13:30", "it's absolutely bullshit they were not", "13:32", "they were so yeah Marine Lines basically", "13:34", "has their there out of friends that's", "13:36", "for sure finally but it took a lot of", "13:38", "shit to get finally get that to get that", "13:40", "so but the real issue in your mind is", "13:43", "the way they treat the animals the way", "13:45", "they've run their business right is that", "13:47", "well I would say that I've expanded now", "13:49", "into just arguing that those animals", "13:52", "should not be in a Marine Lines", "13:54", "possession be all together the whales", "13:56", "your rules is done it should be done", "13:58", "done it should be done and I think after", "14:00", "blackfish I mean before you came on or", "14:02", "when you cave on it was

all of that", "71:20", "every which way that was being nice to", "71:21", "that allow them to actually hunt and", "71:23", "kill the fish which I'm sure that's what", "71:25", "they want to do the
