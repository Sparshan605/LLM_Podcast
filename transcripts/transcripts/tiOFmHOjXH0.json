you're saying just based on the", "19:52", "numbers there has to be something only", "19:58", "life in this book think well the only", "19:59", "life in the universe I'm just saying", "20:01", "like hmm whether or not it's reached us", "20:03", "it well yeah I don't think it's reached", "20:05", "us and if it has reached us it's like", "20:06", "they have to find a way to bend time", "20:08", "right time is the biggest issue no I'm", "20:10", "gonna tell you what the problem like", "20:11", "we're earthlings right yeah and if you", "20:13", "look at how diverse the earth is like", "20:15", "there's different species of shit in the", "20:17", "woods different races of shit in the", "20:18", "water different species of shit in the", "20:19", "jungle different species of shit in the",

"20:29", "universe no no I'm not at all", "20:31", "and sure it is all I'm saying is life", "20:33", "has an end right what is the the oldest", "20:36", "species on the earth right now where the", "20:38", "turtles lived like 200 as I'm sure like", "20:40", "then what so let's say it's 200-300", "20:46", "years right", "20:47", "let's say that's the max now we have 300", "20:51", "years to travel millions of light-years", "20:53", "away to get to another galaxy to see", "20:55", "other planets to see if they have some", "20:56", "shit and they have the same for us so", "20:59", "let's say there is another species did", "21:01", "somehow found a way to take your the", "21:03", "consciousness that they have and put it", "21:05", "in a robot that can then last for", "21:08",

to Mars we can't", "21:18", "come back think we really I think we're", "21:20", "basing that off our intelligence there", "21:21", "might be a species in this universe that", "21:23", "can fly to earth the way we fly to LA", "21:25", "but that's what I'm saying they would", "21:26", "happen at any time not necessarily what", "21:28", "they could do is fold time or fold it", "21:30", "whatever you don't even create that", "21:31", "wormhole thing where you're going where", "21:34", "instead of it's not linear it's whatever", "21:36", "it's in some really time event horizon", "21:40", "they talked about how they did that", "21:41", "remember that movie yeah but and there's", "21:42", "another one too at Matthew McConaughey", "21:44", "oh yeah yeah interstellar yeah where", "21:48", "they get into like space-time space-time", "21:49", "is really interesting right it's like", "21:50", "the faster you go the less you age Yeah", "21:54", "right like so somebody's in a plane", "21:55", "colliders into someone here on the earth", "21:57", "right so some is flying around the earth", "21:59", "and a plane versus us sitting on earth", "22:01", "they will age for actually less right so", "22:03", "if you just increase their speed and", "22:05", "decrease ours when that or keep ours are", "22:08", "the same they will let's say not age at", "22:10", "all compared to us aging like 30 years", "22:12", "even crazier Brian Cox I want to see his", "22:15", "cosmos exhibit I mean that's the the", "22:18", "physicist oh he's a physicist okay from", "22:21", "CERN from the Large Hadron Collider yeah", "22:23", "yeah yeah podcasts and shows he said", "22:26", "that if you were born and right next to", "22:29", "you like your mother and you both put on", "22:31", "a watch at the moment you were born and", "22:33", "then you checked that watch 30 years", "22:35", "later if you have a perfect watch it was", "22:37", "never out of time your watch would have", "22:39", "a different time than her watch because", "22:41", "you have gone through time differently", "22:43", "than she has fraction I don't say that", "22:46", "fractionally because the amount of that", "22:49", "how fast you travel mm-hmm it you you", "22:51", "you experience time in a different way", "22:54", "the path you take in life the different", "22:57", "terrain you travel over the earth all", "22:59", "those factors play in to how much time", "23:01", "has passed let's say you live on the top", "23:03", "of a mountain and she lives at the", "23:05", "bottom you're actually traveling at a", "23:07", "faster rate right because it's no", "23:10", "different than like let's say there's a", "23:12", "ball on a tether right and you're just", "23:14", "swinging it around in a circle right the", "23:16", "ball at the end is actually going faster", "23:18", "than your hand in the middle swinging", "23:20", "around right so since you're going", "23:22", "faster actually aging slower and we're", "23:23", "talking about fractions of seconds yeah", "23:25", "but over the course of time it proves", "23:28", "that everyone experiences time to", "23:30", "slightly", "23:30", "different rate which proves Einstein's", "23:32", "theory that if you travel very fast in", "23:35", "the spaceship and then come back you", "23:37", "would look at your brother who was your", "23:39", "age and now he's a hundred years old and", "23:40", "you know thirty so I think I figured it", "23:42", "out how we can time travel or not time", "23:44", "travel but I think I figured out all", "23:45", "right now so we're trying to create ok", "23:48", "and again I don't know shit but this is", "23:49", "just me like you know this is brilliant", "23:52", "idiot shit right here ok so what we have", "23:53", "to do is go faster than the speed of", "23:55", "light in order time travel I don't know", "23:56", "how to do that just yet but what I think", "23:58", "we can do is we're trying to use like", "24:01", "rockets to propel us at a certain mile", "24:03", "per hour to get close to the speed of", "24:05", "light fuck the fuck the Rockets why", "24:08", "don't we use light as wind and create a", "24:10", "sail that harness light and that sail", "24:14", "will naturally take us the same speed or", "24:17", "as close as we possibly could get to the", "24:19", "speed of light they did in a movie", "24:21", "called sunshine I'm a fucking genius", "24:33", "science fiction movie I'm talking to Bob", "24:39", "Lazar tonight that was the guy I was", "24:40", "telling you I wanted to
