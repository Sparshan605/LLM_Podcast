felt weird man well I", "64:33", "mean I personally my take on it is like", "64:36", "the second one the belly room and we're", "64:39", "in the practice of calling that a", "64:41", "special but it's really not a special in", "64:44", "my opinion what you're seeing is what", "64:47", "here at least indefinitely in Los", "64:49", "Angeles if you live in San Francisco", "64:51", "Denver New York places he likes to", "64:53", "frequent what is what you see Dave", "64:57", "Chappelle known for in these cities", "64:59", "which is he would drop into clubs and", "65:02", "like spill out everything that's on his", "65:05", "mind so I mean I don't know if it's more", "65:07", "like semantics but it's like it's not a", "65:10", "special to me it's like you're seeing", "65:12", "one of the best guys ever do a workout", "65:16", "set like do a loose riff it's only been", "65:20", "six seven weeks since the special was", "65:22", "shot that is that plays before it right", "65:25", "win which he toured for like a year with", "65:27", "that you could see how like polished and", "65:29", "you know I mean so I think it's really", "65:31", "cool if you're a big stand-up nerd to", "65:34", "see the other one like that's what", "65:36", "happens a lot in those cities that he", "65:39", "he'll just fly into and be like yeah", "65:40", "here shit that's on my mind", "65:42", "and and that so you're seeing like it's", "65:44", "it's it's masterful but I think it's", "65:47", "like I don't call I think of it as", "65:49", "separate than a special you know like", "65:53", "because it's special to me is like you", "65:56", "tour you prepare and then like you", "66:00", "present it right I mean I know I", "66:01", "understand that you'd be like well yeah", "66:02", "it's a separate thing it's a special but", "66:04", "I'm saying within that there's something", "66:07", "really specific going on which is like", "66:10", "this is like in the moment", "66:14", "almost all topical commentary and like", "66:18", "that's how that dude works he he's just", "66:21", "well he will walk into a club be like I", "66:22", "wanted to get on stage and like just", "66:25", "talk about he oh he loves topical stuff", "66:27", "so it fits perfectly but it was it's", "66:30", "very different it's I mean you can see", "66:33", "the the total different the contrast", "66:35", "especially if you watch one after the", "66:37", "other yeah you know you're watching", "66:39", "toured proven like worked out stuff and", "66:42", "like here's some shit I thought of", "66:45", "basically last week right right right", "66:48", "but a whole hour of it which is really", "66:50", "crazy yeah I so prolific yeah and the", "66:55", "the fact the way it worked is doing the", "66:57", "two of them together that way you get to", "66:59", "see the big polish special and then you", "67:01", "got to see the fuck around workout set", "67:03", "so it's like if you watch the big polish", "67:04", "specially like I need more yeah it's", "67:07", "really interesting to see I think just", "67:09", "to hear people go back and forth on", "67:12", "which they liked more I thought that was", "67:14", "really interesting I've seen a bunch of", "67:15", "people at least online I'll say they", "67:18", "like the ballet room you know well the", "67:20", "belly room was so intimate to be in that", "67:22", "room I was there for one of those shows", "67:24", "it's so interesting to be there when", "67:27", "you're watching someone film in front of", "67:29", "70 people yeah it's so tight and small", "67:32", "you know you're kind of naked a little", "67:34", "bit you know yeah and the people in the", "67:36", "audience were they were fucking on the", "67:39", "show I mean the

really small special what", "67:50", "that would be like", "67:51", "yeah there's there's different kinds of", "67:54", "comedy right this like the comedy that", "67:55", "you do for 70 people is just not exactly", "67:58", "the same as the comedy that's known for", "68:00", "700 or 7000 and the way you present I", "68:04", "mean he was he basically sat for most of", "68:06", "that yeah so that's that's different you", "68:09", "know I mean usually if you're in a big", "68:11", "2,500 seater you know I got like chill", "68:13", "sit on a bench less you're Marc Maron", "68:15", "Marc I think
