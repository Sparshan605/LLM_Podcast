"Georgie's reckless they're lettin people", "104:27", "go to barber shops to letting people get", "104:29", "a license with no test", "104:31", "you know George is right next to Florida", "104:32", "oh just sayin but I would think of no no", "104:37", "offense Florida but I would think of", "104:39", "Georgia above floor I think Atlanta", "104:41", "above any city that is in Florida no", "104:44", "offense Florida but me to be Miami's a", "104:47", "party city all the rest of them there's", "104:49", "not there's not a city that has the kind", "104:50", "of sophistication that Atlanta

against the cities for the", "105:37", "water exact water rights yeah this is a", "105:40", "lot going on you know so so yeah I think", "105:43", "that again if it worked if the system", "105:46", "worked we'd have a system of", "105:48", "common-sense unfortunately we just have", "105:50", "one extreme of the other day the thing", "105:52", "about no guns it's like what do you", "105:55", "think this there's already millions of", "105:57", "guns out there so that that's impossible", "105:59", "like that's an unreasonable", "106:00", "it is very misleading there's not a", "106:05",

you look at like Windows", "166:48", "right like we're on Windows whatever", "166:50", "we're not still on Windows one yeah", "166:52", "because they were like oh this works", "166:54", "better oh this didn't work we got to", "166:56", "change that", "166:57", "oh this works better and they you keep", "166:59", "adapting and changing the product or the", "167:01", "same thing now sometimes you know like", "167:03", "with the Apple would iPhones it's like", "167:04", "sometimes lucky that phone you just", "167:07", "change it for the sake of change in it", "167:08", "like there's a reason

"part of that is is marketing right like", "167:42", "that the f-150 there's nothing more", "167:44", "American than a Ford pickup truck but", "167:46", "it's made in Mexico is it really yeah", "167:48", "there's f-150 plants in Mexico they're", "167:50", "not all made here in the US just like", "167:53", "BMWs SUVs are made in South Carolina", "167:57", "yeah made in Ohio so you and this is", "168:03", "what I'm talking about about the global", "168:04", "part they figured out well it was", "168:07", "cheaper to make because America buys the", "168:09", "most SUVs so BMW said well let's just", "168:13", "make them there then we don't have to", "168:14", "ship them across an ocean right makes", "168:16", "sense and then the same thing probably", "168:18", "the NSX so like listen

talk about that value", "168:32", "there are some things like", "168:34", "like Ferraris you know like it's a", "168:36", "Ferrari so it it has a value to it in", "168:40", "the fact that it's Italian adds to the", "168:43", "value of it right just yeah they yeah", "168:46", "when you talk about adding value like", "168:48", "some Italian like we're just like well", "168:50", "yeah that's even though a lot of times", "168:52", "the quality was like you know falling", "168:56", "off or whatever but it was just the fact", "168:57", "that it's Italian so yes we could do", "169:01", "that but I don't know that that anybody", "169:03", "will yeah I was designed by artisans", "169:05", "that's the idea I mean if you go my", "169:07", "buddy mine went to Lamborghini factory", "169:09", "he said first of all he goes they", "169:10", "stopped working for like two or three", "169:13", "hours and they just eat pasta and take", "169:15", "naps yeah and he's like it takes forever", "169:17", "to
