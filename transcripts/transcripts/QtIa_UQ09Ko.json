I kind of", "119:02", "make it a little more consistent with", "119:04", "that because it strengthens your lower", "119:06", "back in a real weird way that's hard to", "119:08", "reach any other way it is and I like how", "119:09", "it gives you the traction - yes the like", "119:12", "yeah it gives you traction but it gives", "119:14", "you like what do they call it active", "119:16", "traction right so it's like", "119:17", "decompressing active decompression yeah", "119:20", "it's awesome man I love it I love those", "119:22", "teetered things to hang by your ankles", "119:24", "like you know give your first inversion", "119:25", "yeah them too I got the inverted table", "119:29", "which is great with hanging by your", "119:30", "ankles but then I got another one what's", "119:32",

"119:40", "ankles it's great but it's like the", "119:42", "weight is going from your ankles and", "119:44", "your knees yes yeah by the time you get", "119:47", "to your back and how much compression", "119:48", "you're not yeah it definitely is not", "119:50", "again", "119:50", "but I think the Dex really targets the", "119:52", "lower back amazing I see people have the", "119:54", "ones that lay down and then they attach", "119:56", "that on and pull them apart yeah I", "119:58", "haven't done that one that's the Dex", "119:59", "the Dex decompression one I fucking love", "120:01", "that thing so you grab a hole those", "120:03", "handles and then you let go and then", "120:05", "you're you just drop down and it's all", "120:08", "the weight is like decompressing your", "120:10", "lower back and you could do like yeah", "120:14", "you could do back extension more yeah", "120:16", "yeah I think that's what they're called", "120:17", "yeah you could do those on it too I mean", "120:19", "you could definitely get a workout on if", "120:20", "you wanted to but for me I used that", "120:22", "after I'm done working out just to just", "120:24", "I feel like if I'm real consistent with", "120:27", "that with that and the inversion deck in", "120:29", "the reverse hyper I keep my back healthy", "120:32", "yeah yeah I got I got a I go to a", "120:35",

like", "120:45", "there's different schools that thought", "120:46", "when it comes to strength and", "120:47", "conditioning and the more radical Stern", "120:49", "school of thought was the Marberry", "120:51", "Novick sort of a school of thought which", "120:55", "you see Nickerson does with who's doing", "120:58", "with how fail dos Santos and a lot of", "121:00", "guys where you concentrate almost", "121:03", "entirely on strength conditioning and", "121:04", "the idea is like you already know how to", "121:06", "fight like you know how to fight and the", "121:08", "real thing that fucks with guys when", "121:10", "they're fighting is their conditioning", "121:11", "and so they're putting these guys", "121:13", "through these radical plyometric", "121:16", "and explosive exercises and then just", "121:18", "like push and that comes first that is", "121:20", "more important than anything and that's", "121:22", "when BJ was at its best if you go back", "121:24", "to like BJ we fought Sean Sherk right BJ", "121:26", "when he fought Diego Sanchez he was", "121:29", "training with Marv yeah I'm I think I'm", "121:32", "on the opposite side of that I mean I", "121:33", "conditions never been an issue for me", "121:35", "maybe that's why I have this take I feel", "121:37", "like I want to feel good on smaran days", "121:39", "those are the most important days I need", "121:41", "I need to feel good mm-hmm so I feel", "121:43", "like sometimes you spend you put", "121:45", "yourself out straining condition you", "121:47", "come to spar the

some guys that maybe that", "121:57", "are afraid to get himself tired that you", "122:00", "got to make them get like he's not gonna", "122:01", "push themselves that much when they're", "122:03", "smart if they're scared you're tired but", "122:05", "you could push them hard as hell when", "122:07", "they're not worrying about getting", "122:08", "punched or worried about winning", "122:09", "anything that's good thing about strain", "122:10", "condition you can really push yourself", "122:11", "without hopefully getting hurt as well I", "122:13", "think a lot of strain condition people", "122:15", "that they they just want to put the cool", "122:19", "videos up and right so you know put the", "122:22", "chains on and do this and flip the tire", "122:24", "I just want to keep it simple
