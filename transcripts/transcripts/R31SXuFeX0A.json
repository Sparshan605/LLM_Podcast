because", "09:20", "everybody was at least people who are", "09:22", "interested in this sort of thing we're", "09:23", "kind of looking to the sky anyway", "09:25", "because this was the closest pass

"12:17", "one thirtieth of the actual time that we", "12:20", "humans have been here now now it could", "12:22", "be that modern humans have actually been", "12:24", "here much longer than than 180 thousand", "12:26", "years we have no way of knowing at what", "12:28", "point we moderns first appeared on this", "12:31", "planet but when you think of a hundred", "12:33", "and eighty thousand years compared to", "12:36", "let's say in round numbers five thousand", "12:38", "years it means that there's a lot of the", "12:39", "human story missing and the thing that's", "12:44", "always intrigued me is that given the", "12:47", "assumption that they would have had the", "12:49", "same intelligence as us the same big", "12:52", "they've got the same brain case size the", "12:54",

what we see is", "13:15", "that there's basically no record to", "13:18", "speak of of what people were doing", "13:19", "culturally and and that has led a lot of", "13:24", "scientists to assume that

kind of", "13:36", "hunter-gatherer existence right but what", "13:39", "they haven't taken into account is the", "13:42", "extremity of some of the global changes", "13:45", "that have occurred in in the interval", "13:47", "that we humans have been here and as we", "13:50", "go through our discussion today and I'll", "13:51", "we'll pull up some images I think you'll", "13:53", "begin to get an

whole lot of hard at cultural", "14:08", "evidence because what you'll hopefully", "14:11", "begin to appreciate is that were some of", "14:14", "these events of the scale and magnitude", "14:16",

don't", "15:17", "think we could really wrap our head", "15:19", "around the idea that 10,000 years is", "15:22", "such an incredible length of time that", "15:25", "if you left a car out for 10,000 years", "15:28", "within you know three or four thousand", "15:31", "it would be absorbed completely by the", "15:33", "earth Joe within three or four centuries", "15:35", "really oh yeah I mean if you look at I", "15:38", "mean steel body cars I remember very", "15:40", "well as a kid not far from where we", "15:42", "lived there was a auto junk auto", "15:44", "graveyard and all the teenagers

thing which is", "47:21", "interesting to me is because when you", "47:23", "look at at REE Plato's account he", "47:26", "describes Atlantis as being west of the", "47:28", "pillars of Herakles which of course is", "47:30", "the Straits of Gibraltar the mouth of", "47:32", "the Mediterranean he describes how if", "47:37", "you go you come to some islands then you", "47:39", "come to some more islands and that was", "47:41", "the the island complex of Atlantis and", "47:44", "beyond that was another cold continent", "47:47", "he describes that right if you look in", "47:49", "the middle of the Atlantic Ocean you've", "47:51", "got the Azores Plateau which is now a", "47:55", "couple of thousand feet under the sea", "47:57", "the Azore islands are the tops of", "48:01", "mountains that that emerge from the", "48:04", "surface of the ocean right and they sit", "48:08", "right on the Atlantic the mid-atlantic", "48:11", "ridge now the mid-atlantic ridge some of", "48:15", "the thinnest crusts on the planet right", "48:17", "and it's it's like a giant suture or a", "48:20", "giant crack that runs up halfway around", "48:23", "the planet well when you have an ice age", "48:26", "and you start piling ice up onto like", "48:29", "the North American continent what", "48:31", "happens is the weight of that ice begins", "48:33", "to crush the the crust of the earth down", "48:37", "in", "48:38", "to the mantel it's called isostasy which", "48:41", "is a vertical movement you know", "48:43", "continental drift is horizontal isostasy", "48:46", "is vertical now it's just like right now", "48:49", "you're sitting on that soft chair right", "48:51", "and your ass is creating a depression in", "48:54", "the cushion of the chair right that's", "48:56",

minute there are", "49:47", "photographs taken where you can see the", "49:50", "elevated shoreline surrounding Hudson", "49:52", "Bay because it's still rising right", "49:55", "what's interesting too is if you look at", "49:57", "the the the distance between these", "50:00", "shorelines you'll see that early on", "50:03", "there's a greater distance because the", "50:06", "land was rising faster as the millennia", "50:09", "have have gone on the distance", "50:11", "separating each shoreline has diminished", "50:13", "but now you have to think that all of", "50:15", "that weight is being transferred back", "50:17", "into the ocean basins a lot of it was", "50:21", "dumped directly into the Atlantic Ocean", "50:23", "either via like the st.

now you've got the", "50:44", "mid-atlantic ridge which is some of the", "50:45", "thinnest crust on the earth right this", "50:48", "is what it's doing it's like a hinge", "50:51", "line", "50:52",

"51:04", "water goes in sea level rises it", "51:06", "subsides right now you look at the", "51:09", "Azores Plateau is a chunk of the African", "51:12", "plate that got left over when the", "51:16", "continents separated around 70 to 80", "51:18", "million years ago right if we you've", "51:21", "seen the maps in the showing how you can", "51:24", "fit the contents together yeah if you", "51:26", "fit these back together if you if you", "51:28", "reverse continental drift go back about", "51:31", "70 or 80 million years and it's all fits", "51:33", "together like a piece of the puzzle but", "51:35", "when it's separated a piece of the of", "51:38", "the African plate got left behind and", "51:41", "this is what is the Azores Plateau and", "51:43", "it sits right there astride the", "51:45", "mid-atlantic ridge it's maybe a little", "51:48", "bit smaller than the Maya then Iceland", "51:50", "which is considered to be an island but", "51:52", "of a pretty good sized island right now", "51:55", "if you're doing this and you have as", "51:58", "much as two or three thousand feet or", "51:59", "maybe more of this vertical movement", "52:02", "right and you add to that to four", "52:04", "hundred feet of sea level rise", "52:06", "now you can I think begin to get a", "52:08", "scientific rationale for how you may", "52:10", "have had a large island in the", "52:12",

been of one of the most benign", "53:15", "places on earth to live during the Ice", "53:17", "Age and if there was a place where", "53:19", "civilization could evolve that would be", "53:22", "a very logical place for it to occur", "53:24", "there's nothing really pseudo-scientific", "53:26", "now about assuming that there could have", "53:29", "been some type of historic reality", "53:31", "behind these stories of Atlantis of", "53:34", "course the problem is is the woowoo", "53:36", "factor that has gotten so grafted on to", "53:38", "these stories but you know crystals and", "53:42", "aliens and flying ships and I mean we", "53:45", "don't know but you know we don't have", "53:46", "any hard evidence but the hard evidence", "53:48", "does suggest that there could have been", "53:50", "some very benign habitable islands large", "53:54", "islands in the Mid Atlantic during the", "53:56", "Ice Age wow so that's intense that's so", "54:02", "incredible it so it's it's it's so crazy", "54:04", "to think how how much things have", "54:07", "changed while human beings have been", "54:09", "here the idea that during gobekli tepe", "54:12", "which is 12,000 years ago that north", "54:15", "america was covered with ice and they", "54:18", "this was when these people in Turkey had", "54:21", "created this incredible structure so", "54:24", "when you see this the the modern", "54:27", "hysteria about global warming which has", "54:29", "really essentially been like a wrestling", "54:31", "match between the left and the right", "54:33", "it's this weird thing where

have what is your take on all", "55:04", "this stuff well I guess my take is is is", "55:08", "fairly simple I I tend to think that you", "55:12", "know if you know if you look at the the", "55:14", "the whole process of if you look at the", "55:17", "carbon cycle for example", "55:18", "what what you see there is interesting", "55:21", "we have to I can talk to this into this", "55:23", "as much as possible yeah have as little", "55:25", "variation in the tone as possible thank", "55:27", "you you know putting this into context", "55:31", "we have to say right now we're", "55:33", "approaching 400 parts per million of the", "55:37", "ambient amount of co2 in the atmosphere", "55:40", "at the beginning of the Industrial", "55:42", "Revolution it was about a hundred parts",

"assuming that it's all from us now I", "55:55", "mean there's questions about that too", "55:57", "because if there are other factors", "55:58", "inducing global warming such as changes", "56:01",

are a gigantic carbon dioxide", "56:12", "sink when they're warm they exude carbon", "56:17", "dioxide when they're cold they absorb it", "56:19", "right so if you have a natural warming", "56:22", "it's going to expel some carbon dioxide", "56:25", "so it's not even clear necessarily that", "56:28", "that 100 parts per million is totally", "56:30", "the result of fossil fuel burning but", "56:33", "for the sake of argument let's say that", "56:35", "it is okay a hundred parts per million", "56:38", "that's minuscule trace of this very", "56:42", "important constituents of our atmosphere", "56:44", "you know that carbon dioxide is what", "56:46", "fuels photosynthesis right and if you", "56:50", "start reducing the amount of carbon", "56:51", "dioxide in the atmosphere and you start", "56:53", "once you start dropping below 200 parts", "56:55", "per million and you get down to about", "56:56", "150 to 100 photosynthesis plant food of", "57:00", "synthesis starts shutting down I mean", "57:03", "it's kind of like the amount of co2 in", "57:05", "the atmosphere right now is at the very", "57:07", "bottom of the scale you know if we look", "57:10", "at history going back when you mentioned", "57:12", "the cretaceous-tertiary when the", "57:13", "dinosaurs ruled there have been many", "57:16", "times more the the amount of co2 up to", "57:21", "well in

per", "57:31", "million", "57:32", "in a hundred years it means we've for", "57:35", "every million molecules of air up there", "57:38", "we add one molecule of co2 every year or", "57:43", "two maybe

"not convinced that that's going to lead", "57:59", "to global catastrophe", "58:01", "I mean think of it this way you got a", "58:02", "huge tank with a hundred thousand fish", "58:04", "in it every 10 years you're throwing one", "58:07", "more fish are you even going to notice", "58:09", "that you know I think that what's", "58:12", "happened is that co2 like I said is one", "58:15", "variable in a very complex equation but", "58:18", "all of the other variables as far as the", "58:20", "the government-funded research goes have", "58:23", "been excluded from the debate and what", "58:27",

mammoth", "91:54", "was found and so they took photos of it", "91:57", "when it was found like this and then", "91:59", "they left it alone and the wolf's came", "92:00", "and got it this is not this is a", "92:02", "reconstruction guys I believe in the", "92:04", "Leningrad Museum so what they did was", "92:06", "they took the remains of the woolly", "92:08", "mammoth and in taxidermists came in

would have had to been", "93:56", "frozen through and through in 10 hours", "93:58", "or less now bear in mind that this", "94:01", "woolly mammoth was eating flowering", "94:03", "plants right now

"94:29", "some speculation the speculation that I", "94:33", "found most interesting was possibly", "94:36", "volcanic gases that had been ejected up", "94:39", "into the stratosphere approached",

"mammoth underwent was disastrous in the", "95:05", "extreme you saw him sitting there on his", "95:08", "haunches right both of his hip bones", "95:09", "were broken which means that he was", "95:12", "slammed back onto his haunches", "95:13", "very violently he was also found with an", "95:17", "erect penis which means that he died by", "95:21", "suffocation", "95:22", "which meant that

about how the Little", "95:33", "Ice Age ended around 1850 well this guy", "95:35", "was found about 1901 after the climate", "95:38", "and Siberia had been warming somewhat", "95:40", "see and what happened was a part of a", "95:43", "clip a cliff that had been next to the", "95:45", "veresov career the Berezovsky River had", "95:48", "shifted its channel and eroded some of", "95:51", "the cliff

when the Wolves came in and began to", "96:04", "devour the flesh on the of the Scala see", "96:07", "so clearly this Morley mammoth is an", "96:10", "example of or indicative of some type of",

was", "97:42", "like what the fuck's a caldera and then", "97:43", "they started talking about how it's what", "97:45", "was it something like 600 kilometers", "97:47", "wide or something crazy like

what you were talking about", "127:11", "earlier that the idea the the ideas of", "127:15", "science were that everything had taken", "127:16", "place much like evolution on a very", "127:18", "gradual pace exactly is this the Grand", "127:22", "Canyon as well no I would here's what I", "127:25", "would say about the Grand Canyon I think", "127:27", "that the Grand Canyon is presently we", "127:30", "can observe it that we can observe the", "127:31", "Colorado River eroding the Grand Canyon", "127:34", "however I think that the erosion of the", "127:37", "Grand Canyon is not uniform it's episode", "127:40", "ik which means that the Grand Canyon has", "127:44", "probably been there between two and five", "127:46", "million years because for one thing the", "127:48", "Grand Canyon wouldn't start eroding", "127:50", "until the Colorado Plateau had lifted up", "127:52", "and 10 to 12 million years ago the rim", "127:55", "rock of color of the Colorado Plateau", "127:57", "was lime stones which implies a shallow", "128:00", "marine environment right now when it's", "128:04", "down at marine at sea level it's not", "128:07", "going to Road it's not until the whole", "128:09", "plateau lifts up between five and ten", "128:12", "million years ago that the down cutting", "128:14", "can start so my take on the Grand Canyon", "128:20", "would be that what happens is as we have", "128:22", "you have to understand us now this is", "128:25", "this is I think now is the is the the", "128:26", "merging emerging paradigm there are two", "128:29", "modes of change the

you want to call it the", "128:41", "catastrophic mode where as much change", "128:44", "it's compressed", "128:45", "into a few years or months or sometimes", "128:48", "even days or weeks as normally would", "128:50", "take thousands and thousands of years", "128:52", "when I look at the Grand Canyon what I'm", "128:55", "seeing there is episodes of catastrophic", "128:57", "erosion probably stretching back over", "129:00", "two and a half million years remember I", "129:02", "said the Pleistocene was about two and a", "129:04", "half million years what characterizes", "129:07", "the Pleistocene from the previous", "129:09", "Pliocene is this alternating succession", "129:12", "of glacial and interglacial ages this", "129:15", "swinging back and forth between these", "129:16", "two extremes those episodes of", "129:19", "transition appear to be profoundly", "129:22", "catastrophic and they are associated", "129:24", "with things like massive storms massive", "129:28", "rainfalls rising and falling of sea", "129:30", "levels on an extreme basis and I think", "129:35", "it's that that has created the Grand", "129:38", "Canyon predominant in fact the inner", "129:42", "Channel I know if you've ever seen Grand", "129:43", "Canyon yes yeah okay there's an inner", "129:45", "gorge I could guess that that inner", "129:48", "gorge is probably less than a hundred", "129:50", "thousand years old and probably a lot of", "129:52", "it was cut 13,000 years ago Wow and so", "129:55", "that's when the Pleistocene ended", "129:57", "somewhere around ten thousand years ago", "129:59", "yeah ten to thirteen thousand years ago", "130:01", "Wow", "130:02", "yeah and that's a that's not a real", "130:03", "picture is it no it seems like an", "130:05", "artist's rendition yeah I have pictures", "130:08", "somewhere in there we're still where you", "130:10", "get a sense yeah now the the", "130:14", "accumulation of the sedimentary rocks", "130:16", "yeah took hundreds of millions of years", "130:18", "but that's one process the down cutting", "130:21", "the erosion of the Canyon is a different", "130:23", "process so again it comes to a matter of", "130:27", "perspective that we're almost incapable", "130:29", "of let me I think you know academically", "130:34", "and you you could sort of explain how", "130:38", "all this takes place and

like fuck remove that but some of", "140:45", "the stones see that's not a good one", "140:47", "Jamie there's there some where you can", "140:49", "see the massive amount of stone that was",

the fuck is", "141:04", "that that is so big", "141:06", "yeah it's they moved that they cut that", "141:09", "quarried it and moved it yeah I mean I", "141:12", "don't know how many people they had to", "141:14", "do that but boy that doesn't seem like", "141:17", "something that a society which is really", "141:19", "concerned with feeding itself is is", "141:21", "going to get done right",

6 2", "141:42", "million three hundred thousand-plus", "141:44", "stones in the Great Pyramid of Giza and", "141:47", "if you cut and place ten a day it would", "141:50", "take you six hundred

buildings like", "143:06", "that yeah those things survived and then", "143:09", "people tried to recreate them people", "143:12", "eventually figured out some of the", "143:14", "techniques and made similar structures", "143:17", "but not over a period of a thousand", "143:19", "years or 2,000 years but maybe twenty", "143:22", "thirty thousand years mm-hmm that's", "143:24", "always been the work of Graham Hancock", "143:27", "the the the ideas they bounced around", "143:30", "and I remember there was that Charlton", "143:32", "Heston narrated documentary on the", "143:35", "Sphinx where

average or", "144:08", "the the conventional dating of the", "144:11", "pyramid there it is right there the some", "144:13", "of his explanations it predates the what", "144:16", "the conventional date of the", "144:18", "is by more than 5,000 years oh I'm", "144:21", "convinced and I've had conversations", "144:22", "with Robert where he will basically say", "144:26", "he's got one number for public", "144:27", "consumption but he's perfectly willing", "144:29", "to admit that perhaps this makes is much", "144:32", "much older than that and I what's the", "144:34", "dark number what's the crazy number oh I", "144:37", "think the crazy number is tens of", "144:39", "thousands of years if you pull up it's", "144:43", "not that crazy though now it was kind of", "144:46", "crazy when that Charlton Heston document", "144:48", "and documentary was around but now that", "144:51", "they found gobekli tepe", "144:53", "and they know that fourteen thousand", "144:55", "twelve thousand years ago whatever it", "144:57", "was they were absolutely building these", "145:00", "enormous immense structures that would", "145:02", "be what eight thousand years seven", "145:06", "thousand years earlier than the pyramids", "145:08", "mm-hmm mm-hmm not that not that big a", "145:10", "deal not that big of a deal they the", "145:13", "conventional dating of the Great Pyramid", "145:14", "Giza is 2,500 BC which may be correct", "145:19", "but it still doesn't mean that the", "145:21", "Sphinx wasn't way way old and way older", "145:24", "than that exactly and you know I'm", "145:26", "convinced having seen it firsthand that", "145:28", "that erosion is water induced I've", "145:31", "looked at a lot of erosion over the", "145:32", "years and you know it's got the classic",

the Greek term for the destruction", "145:58", "of the world by water oh wow it's from", "146:01", "where we get our term Cataclysm whoa and", "146:03", "their term C you know the Greeks", "146:06",

stuff I mean these", "146:32", "all of these ancient structures there's", "146:35", "no way you can attribute it to what we", "146:38", "know about their culture we don't know", "146:40", "enough there's just not enough evidence", "146:42", "there's not enough we don't know enough", "146:45", "about ancient Egypt or you know or their", "146:49", "construction methods there's so much", "146:51", "there's so much thinking like there's so", "146:54", "much guesswork it's so much you know", "146:58", "when you look at these giant structures", "147:00", "and you wonder like what what were they", "147:03", "doing how did they do this who were they", "147:04", "like it's so fascinating I would just I", "147:08", "would love to be able to go back in time", "147:10", "it's a giant bulletproof bubble I know", "147:12", "I'm just hover over ancient Egypt yeah", "147:15", "what's going on back then I know why did", "147:18", "you guys know Jamie go to you've got a", "147:21", "global super flood what is this image go", "147:24", "to slide 58 a slide the infamous slide", "147:30", "58 hangar 18 slide 58 oh wow that's", "147:37", "beautiful", "147:38", "okay that's amazing now what you can see", "147:40", "there is you got to get it in that's a", "147:44", "microphone get on the microphone there", "147:45", "the valley temple look up there oh yeah", "147:47", "okay the valley temple with stones", "147:49", "quarried from the ditch around the", "147:53", "sphinx you got to remember what the", "147:55", "Sphinx is that originally it was a", "147:57", "yardang which is a which is a limestone", "147:59", "outcrop that sticks above the", "148:01", "surrounding landscape the yardang was", "148:04", "the head of the Sphinx everything else", "148:05", "was below now go to the next slide Jamie", "148:10", "okay there you can really see the ditch", "148:12", "surrounding the Sphinx and the layers", "148:14", "forming the Sphinx body correspond to", "148:17", "the layers in the surrounding ditch now", "148:20", "wanted to me you'll notice the", "148:21", "scaffolding next to the Sphinx they're", "148:24", "there they're undertaking these", "148:25", "campaigns of rests quote/unquote", "148:27", "restoration gross but what they're", "148:30", "actually doing is they're covering up", "148:31", "the real message of the Sphinx yeah why", "148:34", "are they doing now why are they", "148:35", "bothering to try to rebuild the phone I", "148:37", "don't know it's so stupid like wait", "148:40", "you're not rebuilding it you're building", "148:42", "new shit yeah you're just refacing it", "148:44", "yeah", "148:45", "with new", "148:45", "stealth so gross but at least nobody is", "148:48", "messing with the quarry walls where you", "148:51", "can see the water erosion so effectively", "148:54", "displayed go to the next slide Jamie now", "148:59", "what we see here is an abandoned quarry", "149:02", "it's hard to tell the scale here because", "149:06", "that opening is like 40 feet high but if", "149:08", "you look at you see the striations in", "149:10", "the rock wall mm-hmm okay this is where", "149:14", "they quarried the blocks right and", "149:16", "remove the blocks go to the next slide", "149:18", "Jamie okay this kind of shows the", "149:21", "methodology that they use they would", "149:23", "create these separation trenches they", "149:26", "would usually go by the the natural bed", "149:30", "bedding layers of the rock go to the", "149:32", "next slide and you'll see here here's", "149:35", "the presumed process where they're", "149:38", "cutting a separation trench and there's", "149:42", "a block about to be quarried there and", "149:44", "then you can see there would have a", "149:45", "stack of four blocks there and these", "149:47", "blocks are enormous several tons oh yeah", "149:49", "that block there would be looks like", "149:51", "it's probably about four by eight by", "149:54", "probably ten so like 320 cubic feet at", "149:59", "160 per so or 180 so you're looking at", "150:05", "about fifty seven thousand pounds", "150:07", "divided by two thousand so yeah but -", "150:10", "yeah bout 30 tons see it's about 30 tons", "150:14", "for that rock right there now go to the", "150:16", "next slide 30 tons mmm okay now the", "150:19", "reason I'm showing you this is because", "150:21", "this is the process they would have used", "150:23", "to quarry the blocks away from the the", "150:26", "surrounding the Sphinx and exposed a", "150:29", "quarry wall well at the time that quarry", "150:32", "wall was exposed", "150:34", "it would have been essentially a flat", "150:36", "surface with this slightly stepped", "150:38", "profile like we saw in the photograph", "150:39", "right now go to the next slide right so", "150:44", "there's now would be a cross-section", "150:46", "with all of the blocks removed okay go", "150:49", "to the next slide and what we have here", "150:52", "is stone pick marks in a limestone lets", "150:55", "you go quarry from Rama seed x about", "150:59", "twelve", "150:59", "hundred BC so about 3200 years ago so", "151:01", "here's a limestone face of a quarry", "151:04", "that's been exposed for 3,200 years and", "151:07", "seems like they used some sort of a", "151:09", "chisel - yeah exactly the the pick marks", "151:12", "are still visible go to the next slide", "151:14", "okay here's stone pick marks in a quarry", "151:17", "from the early New Kingdom circa 15 so", "151:19", "3500 years ago you can actually", "151:22", "determine the type of tool that they", "151:24", "used to quarry the rocks the picks are", "151:28", "the chisels go to the next one based on", "151:31", "the marks that are based on tomorrow's", "151:32", "yeah and here you see that the chisel", "151:34", "marks made or pick marks made by stone", "151:36", "picks in an Old Kingdom limestone quarry", "151:39", "2,000 years BC so here's a 4,000 year", "151:42", "old quarry that's been sitting exposed", "151:44", "to the desert elements and the pit marks", "151:47", "are still visible on the face now go to", "151:49", "the next slide now here's the Sphinx go", "151:52", "to the next slide and look at that", "151:55", "quarry wall yeah that's crazy it's crazy", "151:58", "yeah now supposedly this quarry wall is", "152:01", "only a few centuries older than that", "152:03", "last picture we just saw where we could", "152:05", "see the pic marks", "152:06", "does that make sense well the only way", "152:09", "it would make sense as if there was a", "152:10", "vastly different type of stone well it's", "152:13", "not though it's it's the same it's it's", "152:15", "a well indurated limestone Robert can", "152:17", "tell you all about the composition of", "152:20", "that stone the the composition does vary", "152:22", "though oh yeah like some of its more", "152:24", "dense than others and that's you're", "152:26", "conceive of the changes yeah and you can", "152:28", "see that that indented layer about", "152:30", "halfway up is going to be a softer", "152:32", "limestone absolutely it certainly looks", "152:35", "to the layman

like water but some legit", "152:48", "Egyptologists and even legit geologists", "152:51", "have tried to attribute this to wind and", "152:53", "sand well again you know Robert has", "152:58", "shown

feet and air shows each of the", "153:59", "layers like if you look at layer 11", "154:01", "that's gonna be a softer limestone its", "154:03", "eroded deeper right now go to the next", "154:07",

think", "154:34", "Robert would confirm this that the", "154:36", "limestone blocks that formed those", "154:38", "temples were sheathed in hard granite", "154:40", "hmm whereas this quarry wall was

much", "165:35", "of an impact would that have had oh it", "165:38", "would have created tsunamis well on the", "165:41", "island of Madagascar on the southern", "165:43", "island of Madagascar and it should be in", "165:45", "this in this program that we've got open", "165:48", "right here Jamie if you go to slide", "165:53", "number yeah go to slide number 111 it's", "166:01", "so ironic that

has is on hard drives I mean", "166:27", "how much of what everybody has is in the", "166:29", "cloud on a you know a server somewhere", "166:31", "yeah and who the fuck is going to be", "166:34", "able to figure out", "166:35", "how to read that shit a thousand years", "166:36", "from now yeah just lightning happen to", "166:38", "us", "166:38", "yeah just like we're trying to figure", "166:39", "out how to read a Gyptian hi laughs okay", "166:42", "look at look at slide number hundred", "166:43", "eleven now I wish I had my pointer here", "166:47", "go to the next slide so you can see we", "166:50", "okay right there you see you see those", "166:52", "Wiggly things it's like dragon scales", "166:54", "yeah what that is is it's water ocean", "166:59", "water that washed on land and washed up", "167:03", "and you see it kind of comes to a point", "167:04", "and then it washed back out this is this", "167:07", "is a tsunami deposit and those features", "167:12", "that you're looking at they kind of look", "167:13", "like this", "167:13", "they're called Chevron's right that's", "167:16", "what happens when the water washes in", "167:18", "makes deposits of giant ripples and then", "167:22", "washes back out what kind of time frame", "167:23", "are you talking about when this happens", "167:25", "I want this to do that", "167:27", "Oh hours so that all happened in hours", "167:31", "in hours yeah I mean you could still see", "167:32", "it today oh yeah go to the next slide", "167:34", "Jaime we're getting a closer up look", "167:37", "here now you see how see how they're", "167:40", "shaped almost V like mm-hmm", "167:41", "that's the Chevron like a sergeant", "167:43", "stripe almost right okay go to the next", "167:46", "slide okay here's a cross section of one", "167:49", "of those v-shaped Hills it's 600 feet", "167:52", "and Heights wow that's incredible now", "167:56", "what so what you're seeing in the back", "167:57", "then up one more Jaime so those images", "168:00", "right there what we're seeing there it", "168:04", "looks like the effects of a river or", "168:06", "water or something it is water yeah but", "168:09", "then when you go back you see it from", "168:11", "the ground it looks like hills yeah 600", "168:14", "feet high so you're talking about a", "168:15", "massive amount of water we're talking", "168:18", "about a tsunami who's minimum run-up", "168:21", "height is the height the thickness of", "168:23", "these hills 600 feet minimum minimum", "168:26", "minimum and that's of course massive", "168:29", "amount of weight and devastation and", "168:31", "this was all five thousand years ago", "168:32", "yeah go to the next slide Jaime", "168:36", "yeah there's Madagascar location of the", "168:40", "Chevron's on the southern edge of", "168:42", "Madagascar let's see go to slides up and", "168:47", "over on the other side", "168:49", "at the same age if we look at the", "168:52", "southwestern coast of Australia I think", "168:54", "the next slide we'll get a closer in", "168:55", "view", "168:56", "there we go you see that splooge mm-hmm", "168:59", "that's that's the technical scientific", "169:01", "term is it really blue JH no I just made", "169:05", "that you bet you see they see the stuff", "169:09", "that's been washed over you can see it", "169:11", "it's very clear there okay that's the", "169:14", "other side of the ocean so the other", "169:15", "side of the ocean directly opposite of", "169:19", "where this thing impacted yeah goes", "169:21", "against massive impact in

"170:05", "holy shit and so that if that happened", "170:09", "four thousand eight hundred years ago", "170:11", "mm-hmm", "170:12", "what kind of an impact would that have", "170:14", "had on human civilization oh well it was", "170:17", "pretty much would have wiped out", "170:18", "anything adjacent to the Indian Ocean", "170:20", "anything close to it but what about on", "170:23", "the other side of the planet I mean", "170:24", "there'd have to be some massive effects", "170:26", "oh there would be most likely what we", "170:28", "would see on the other side of the", "170:29", "planet is extreme weather events", "170:32", "hurricanes torrential rain falls things", "170:35", "like that when kill a huge amount of", "170:37", "people worldwide could kill a human", "170:39", "mount of people worldwide yes Wow and so", "170:42", "that is probably the most recent one", "170:44", "that's probably the most recent ah and", "170:47", "no record of it because people really", "170:49", "didn't have many records well I think", "170:50", "the record of it is probably when we see", "170:53", "these stories like Noah's Flood and the", "170:56", "rest so that's probably about this one", "170:58", "so it's not even about the Holocene one", "170:59", "it's about one 5,000 years after the", "171:02", "house", "171:03", "yes see that's what we're beginning to", "171:05", "realize now is that these events have", "171:07", "happened with a much greater degree of", "171:09", "frequency than anybody had imagined", "171:12", "well congratulations you freak me the", "171:14", "fuck out I just want to say you know you", "171:17", "had an objective and you pulled it off", "171:19", "five stars a plus freaked out wow this", "171:24", "is this has been an intense three hours", "171:26", "it just flew by three hours yeah we just", "171:28", "did three hours Wow it's over yeah", "171:31", "then amazing yeah we got to do this", "171:32", "again I bet you could talk for another", "171:34", "16 hours yeah I mean we barely scratched", "171:36", "the surface here oh please let's do it", "171:39", "again", "171:39", "let's take a couple months off regroup", "171:41", "and come back in again oh I'd love to do", "171:43", "some more please thank you very much for", "171:44", "doing this I really really appreciate it", "171:46", "is incredibly enjoyable incredibly", "171:48",

have", "172:02", "enjoyed if people want to research more", "172:04", "of your work read more of your stuff", "172:06", "where can they go what can they or can", "172:08", "they find go to sacred geometry", "172:11", "international.com and there are links", "172:14", "there I've got another website that it's", "172:16", "linked from there so I can sacred", "172:19", "geometry international I deal with a", "172:20", "bunch of different stuff not directly", "172:22", "connected necessarily with what we're", "172:24", "talking about here but there will be", "172:26", "links to another website that I've got", "172:27", "where I'm really exploring like the", "172:30", "catastrophic stuff or I've got lots of", "172:32", "images of things yeah because I've done", "172:37", "lots and lots of field exploration they", "172:40", "have thousands of images of just awesome", "172:43", "stuff does the sacred geometry have", "172:45", "anything to do with this stuff or is", "172:47",

what culture you come", "173:34", "from you see", "173:35", "and so geometry is a critical means of", "173:39", "deciphering the the knowledge that and I", "173:42", "think that the that the predominant way", "173:44", "of preserving ancient knowledge is in", "173:46", "the temple structures and they have to", "173:49", "be looked at as textbooks in stone and", "173:51", "once we begin to realize that then we", "173:53", "can go it's like when you go to Egypt", "173:55", "it's not just the hieroglyphs that's a", "173:57", "part of it but it's also the geometry", "173:59", "and the astronomy that's encoded there", "174:01", "and we can see the same astronomy at", "174:03", "work whether we're looking in Egypt", "174:05", "whether in geometry or whether we're", "174:07", "looking

exactly", "174:27", "the same principles underlying that as", "174:31", "we find in Egypt that will be our next", "174:33", "conversation so I'd be a great combo I", "174:34", "can't wait I can't wait
