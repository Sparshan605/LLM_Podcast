"10:24", "over thirty four years old Wow so you", "10:27", "know I mean this this was a bear that", "10:28", "was probably getting closer to the end", "10:30", "of his shelf life and was going to", "10:31", "attack anything when they get ready to", "10:33", "den it's it's almost a certain insanity", "10:36", "that they reach where you know they're", "10:39", "going into hibernation and all's they", "10:40", "think as I've got to eat I've got to get", "10:42", "fat I've got to eat I've got to get fat", "10:44", "if you are you know I always say don't", "10:47", "act like a pork chop if

a whole lot", "11:00", "about it I mean people always ask just", "11:02", "immediately got emotional when I", "11:04", "yeah toe you know I try to talk about it", "11:06", "in the third person I I get my water", "11:08", "from the kavik River and at a certain", "11:10", "point the water is going to freeze over", "11:12", "while I had one more shot at getting", "11:14", "some water so I went down and what I", "11:16", "have to do is get a pump both hands have", "11:18", "to be used to get it in the river and", "11:20", "start it up and I had a juvenile bear", "11:22", "that had been every night he'd come and", "11:25", "he'd go to my helicopter pad dig it up", "11:27", "bury his food and run off I could see", "11:30", "where he was going and where he was", "11:31", "coming from and when a bear does that", "11:33", "he's trying to claim your territory as a", "11:35", "juvenile bear between three and seven", "11:37", "years old you know he's not hot enough", "11:39", "the chicks

smells like food it has cool", "11:48", "dens you don't have to dig it's a prime", "11:50", "place and so it's an alpha pussy the", "11:54", "first step on the Alpha ladder is", "11:55", "subjugate something and take over their", "11:57", "territory and so the long and short I", "12:00", "was getting my water I sat down my rifle", "12:02", "and he was hiding in the cup bank and", "12:04", "snatched me up and you know he he rolls", "12:11", "with you he'll open his jaws put it on", "12:13", "your throat you can still feel here and", "12:15", "here where I ended up having to sew my", "12:17", "head together", "12:18", "he tore the hips out of the sockets and", "12:20", "then he ended up going back in the river", "12:22", "and older bear or a female would have", "12:24", "just eaten me and and that's you know", "12:27", "and and I accept that in my lifestyle I", "12:30", "knew I was injured did not remember I", "12:32", "had a rifle by the river got myself back", "12:34", "to camp I knew my hips weren't in good", "12:36", "shape and he was going to come back and", "12:37", "finish the job", "12:38", "what he did was kick me out of my", "12:40", "property then I am
