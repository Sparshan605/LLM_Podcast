"78:04", "had been given every single opportunity", "78:06", "you know extensions on her 10-year clock", "78:08", "and so on", "78:09", "and then finally when she didn't get 10", "78:11", "years she

write", "78:22", "things down you know", "78:25", "as a as an academic hilarious right i", "78:27", "mean it's unbelievable", "78:28", "so it's like saying her tradition is", "78:30", "being on land", "78:32", "and you shouldn't be forcing her to swim", "78:33", "in a swimming event exactly", "78:35", "right by the way uh judaism is based", "78:39", "also on oral traditions so by that logic",

yeah", "105:46", "so heavy smokers are likely to be the", "105:50", "ones who are", "105:51", "uh experienced erectile as young people", "105:54", "overall vitality is probably decreased", "105:56",

"106:12", "had", "106:13", "mentioned this in several lectures and", "106:16", "then it actually came out in a", "106:18", "promotional campaign i don't know if", "106:20", "they watch my lectures this is i think", "106:21", "health canada", "106:22", "where they had a advertisement with", "106:26", "simply a", "106:28", "cigarette that's limp that was it that's", "106:30", "the whole", "106:32", "now that is exactly what an evolutionary", "106:35", "health", "106:35", "promotion approach would be like and let", "106:37", "me explain why", "106:38", "the typical approach with these types of", "106:40", "social marketing campaigns is", "106:42", "provide people with more information and", "106:45", "that would cause them", "106:46", "to alter their behavior if they're", "106:48",

don't think that's necessarily an", "108:26", "evolutionary trigger i think it's just", "108:28", "because", "108:29", "tobacco is i mean is addictive right and", "108:32", "so yeah but what",

only", "117:39", "six foot or taller it's just that the", "117:40", "woman wants a guy who's taller than her", "117:42", "right so if you look at there is a study", "117:44", "that i've discussed in the past", "117:47", "that looked at something like 720", "117:50", "actual couples and i think there was", "117:51", "only a single one out of the 720", "117:54", "where the woman was taller than the

"118:26", "is where you get women who are super", "118:29", "educated", "118:30", "uh that makes sense the exact same thing", "118:32", "happens sure the more educated a woman", "118:34", "gets the worse her marriage prospects", "118:38", "because the more sophisticated women are", "118:40", "the more they insist on a high status", "118:42", "male", "118:43", "and therefore as i get more

them absolutely by the way i", "119:13", "think so i have another theory which i'd", "119:15", "like to at some point test", "119:16", "maybe someone will steal it now so when", "119:19", "you have a couple that gets married very", "119:21", "young", "119:23", "they are judging one another based on", "119:25", "their mate value at 18 or 19 right so", "119:28", "tony is the high school quarterback and", "119:30", "so he's the hot guy and i'm the", "119:32", "cheerleader and then later he stagnates", "119:35", "he doesn't go on with his career whereas", "119:37", "i go on and become a physician i'm the", "119:40", "cheerleader", "119:40", "so at 29 there is now a huge inequity", "119:44", "between our two mating values on the", "119:46", "mating market right", "119:47", "so when we were both 19 the fact that we", "119:49", "had roughly the same mating value", "119:51", "made us a very attractive stable couple", "119:54", "but tony turned out to be a fucking", "119:56", "loser exactly he's a lame", "119:58", "duck exactly and so i so i have a theory", "120:01", "that and i'd like to at some point test", "120:03", "that maybe some graduate student will", "120:04", "write to me saying i'll work with this", "120:06", "on you", "120:06", "dr saad i have a theory whereby i think", "120:09", "that", "120:10", "in many cases where people end up", "120:12", "divorcing when they married young", "120:14", "it's precisely because that which", "120:17", "started as", "120:17", "equitable mating values at time t 0", "120:20", "turned out to have huge divergence in", "120:22", "our
