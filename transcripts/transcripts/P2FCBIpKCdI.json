["00:08", "alright well live you cold that uh yet", "00:12", "that barn your teeth are you good they", "00:17", "stick those green belly meal bars so", "00:19", "first of all man your documentary yeah", "00:22", "Icarus is I I say that wrong all the", "00:25", "time I say a chorus but it's a caress", "00:27", "right", "00:28", "Icarus yeah that's the guy with the", "00:30", "wings that flew too close to the Sun", "00:31", "exactly it's fucking amazing it's an", "00:34", "amazing documentary I'm I contacted you", "00:37", "we'd gone back and forth a little bit on", "00:39", "Twitter and then I finally sat down and", "00:40", "watched it the other day and I was like", "00:42", "holy shit the extent of the the cover-up", "00:48", "and the the first of all for folks who", "00:51", "don't know what it's about", "00:51", "the documentary started off just kind of", "00:54", "about doping right and then it became", "00:56", "about the state-sponsored Russian doping", "01:00", "program and then it all imploded while", "01:03", "you were doing the documentary night the", "01:06", "documentary how long did it take you to", "01:08", "put this together three and a half years", "01:10", "and so what was the initial idea behind", "01:12", "it so the initial idea I guess I'll say", "01:16", "it's a streaming on Netflix right now", "01:18", "there yeah released it a month ago and", "01:21", "the initial idea had come to me", "01:23", "essentially when Armstrong confessed and", "01:26", "I'd been a lifelong cycling fan and I", "01:29", "had followed him for you know my whole", "01:31", "you know journey with him and and what", "01:35", "struck me the most about his confession", "01:37", "was that if you talk to anybody outside", "01:39", "of the sport", "01:41", "they all thought that he got caught but", "01:43", "the reality is is he actually never got", "01:45", "caught I mean to this day this guy is", "01:48", "past 500 anti doping controls cleaned so", "01:52", "I'm going wait not", "01:54", "what's wrong with Armstrong what's wrong", "01:57", "with this global anti-doping system that", "02:00", "they can't catch the most tested athlete", "02:03",

at this system that is essentially", "02:16", "making an athlete not have a choice as", "02:18", "to what they do or not do if they", "02:21", "actually want to have a possibility of", "02:22", "winning if the system itself is not able", "02:25", "to catch them well that's a big factor", "02:27", "right I mean that is a really an", "02:29", "important thing to talk about the it in", "02:31", "the high level world of cycling when", "02:33", "they took away", "02:34", "Armstrong's victories in the Tour de", "02:35", "France I think that's the person who got", "02:39", "who did not test positive in any tests", "02:43", "before that I think was like 18th place", "02:45", "is that correct someone I don't remember", "02:48", "exactly but yeah but there was there was", "02:50", "no one and then even after his", "02:54", "confession if you remember how they get", "02:56", "him to confess is essentially the the", "02:58", "feds come in on a criminal investigation", "03:01", "and they basically go to all of his", "03:03", "teammates over the years that he had", "03:04", "race and basically you know point guns", "03:07", "of their head and say hey did you dope", "03:09", "or did you not dope now if you tell us", "03:12", "that you doped and that Armstrong doped", "03:14", "you go free and we weren't going to", "03:17", "punish you but if you lie to us there's", "03:20", "gonna be a price to pay and in doing", "03:22", "that all of his teammates who did the", "03:24", "exact same thing that he did ratted him", "03:27", "out in exchange for their own immunity", "03:29", "and then the rest is history well", "03:32", "there's a little more to it too right", "03:33", "like he was actually suing people that", "03:36", "were saying that he was doping and he", "03:38", "was going after them and threatening", "03:39", "them with lawsuits and which you know", "03:43", "that's and that's you know why before I", "03:47", "ever picked up a camera I had named the", "03:50", "film Icarus and I had named it Icarus", "03:53", "because of what I deemed the Armstrong", "03:57", "story which was a story of a guy who", "04:01", "just kept pushing the boundaries and", "04:03", "pushing the boundaries and pushing the", "04:05", "boundaries until he flew too close to", "04:07", "the Sun and his you know wings burn and", "04:09", "he plummeted to the earth and that to me", "04:12", "was the story of you know ambition that", "04:16", "wouldn't stop and having no filter on", "04:20", "how far you went to win and what you", "04:24", "were willing to do when who you were", "04:25", "willing to destroy in that process", "04:27", "to win and to me you know when you take", "04:31", "the doping out of it that's you know the", "04:35", "problem that you know I would have on a", "04:38", "on a on a personal kind of level with", "04:42", "the Lance of it that you know it's one", "04:44", "thing if you're doing something that", "04:45", "everybody else is doing but it's another", "04:47", "thing when you literally you're going", "04:49", "out and destroying other people's lives", "04:50", "to to try to protect your own lies yeah", "04:56", "I mean I kind of see his position I see", "04:58", "how he got caught up in it and the", "04:59", "momentum of it all just sort of brought", "05:01", "him to this place where it was almost no", "05:03", "there's no way to do it either you know", "05:05", "you go after these people and try to", "05:06", "silence them or you come clean and", "05:08", "eventually was forced to come clean", "05:10", "you knew though and most people did that", "05:13", "he was doing something yeah I mean I had", "05:16", "always felt that he was doing something", "05:19", "but I also having been kind of deeply", "05:22", "involved in the sport believed that", "05:23", "everybody else was doing something also", "05:26", "so his confession to me wasn't really", "05:29", "the shocker what was what was the", "05:32", "shocker and what set me out on this", "05:34", "journey was like in the public court of", "05:38", "opinion and what you saw going on in the", "05:40", "news was it was essentially like you", "05:43", "know we've got Gaudi we've got down a", "05:46", "pone we've got the ringleader we've got", "05:50", "the you know the biggest criminal in the", "05:52", "history of sport essentially and we", "05:54", "finally got him and to me it was like", "05:57", "getting out Capone on tax evasion you", "05:59", "didn't get him because the system didn't", "06:02", "work to get him and so I started looking", "06:05", "at forget about cycling I was looking at", "06:08", "well what does this mean in all sports", "06:12", "what does this mean in terms of the", "06:14", "Olympics what does this mean in terms of", "06:16", "basketball and football and baseball and", "06:18", "all these other sports if the most", "06:21", "tested athlete on planet earth can't be", "06:24", "caught and and that's what set me out on", "06:28", "to make the film initially was to", "06:31", "explore using kind of just the Armstrong", "06:35", "story as the framework but to explore", "06:37", "what was what was", "06:39", "wrong with the anti-doping system in", "06:42", "sport and essentially use myself as a", "06:46", "human guinea pig to explore that and", "06:48", "then along that way kind of show whether", "06:52", "or not this system worked and then", "06:54", "essentially present hypotheticals about", "06:57", "what could be done or what couldn't be", "06:59", "done and whether or not we as a society", "07:02", "care about you know drug use in sport", "07:06", "and and that was the original concept", "07:10", "and construct of the film", "07:13", "well drug use in sport is very", "07:15", "complicated because it's it's so", "07:17", "prevalent and and it's almost impossible", "07:19", "to separate the two when you think about", "07:22", "it particularly the Tour de France right", "07:24", "and professional cycling I mean it is", "07:26", "just a dirty sport well I think that", "07:29", "from what I know is over the last", "07:32", "several years it's really cleaned up", "07:34", "quite a bit quite a lot and if you start", "07:37", "looking at the times also they've", "07:39", "they've started to come down and slow", "07:41", "down but I think that we're probably in", "07:45", "a what I would call it I don't know a a", "07:49", "glory period between the science kind of", "07:55", "catching up to the cheaters in some way", "07:56", "and then the cheaters basically figuring", "07:59", "out how to out science the science again", "08:02", "so they're in like a holding pattern I", "08:04", "feel like in the world of cycling at", "08:08", "least that's going on to some extent", "08:10", "since I just get caught just a couple", "08:12", "days ago with a an engine and his bike", "08:14", "oh that's the new thing yeah they're", "08:15", "yeah they're putting engines and bikes", "08:18", "I've read that they're now figuring out", "08:21", "how to replicate a EPO \u00f3r\u00f3 Eaton at the", "08:24", "genetic level basically how to make your", "08:26", "cells naturally create more with rope Oh", "08:30", "Eaton so there's always going to be", "08:33", "something on that cusp of of medical", "08:37", "technology and human evolution trying to", "08:41", "outsmart the system and the testing so", "08:44", "when you contacted the the Russian", "08:47", "gentlemen what was his name again", "08:48", "Gregory retching cough and Gregory is", "08:51", "the guy he's right", "08:52", "now in the witness protection program", "08:54", "protective custody protective custody", "08:56", "now how did you get ahold of him and how", "08:59", "did you set that up because it was", "09:00", "fascinating watch you shoot your ass", "09:02", "full with like a hundred different kinds", "09:03", "of steroids", "09:04", "I mean it was just how much how many", "09:07", "different things did you take I took a", "09:10", "lot over how much of a period about nine", "09:18", "months about nine months and and what", "09:21", "had what had happened is is so I decided", "09:24", "that I was gonna go on this super-sized", "09:27", "Mia's journey into the world of", "09:29", "performance-enhancing drugs and I spend", "09:32", "about a year doing all this research", "09:35", "shortly after Armstrong confesses which", "09:38", "is 2013 early 2013 and actually picked", "09:41", "up a camera in May of 2014 and and over", "09:44", "this year I start talking to all these", "09:46", "scientists and I'm contacting people on", "09:49", "a global level in Switzerland and", "09:51", "Germany and the UK and all over the US", "09:54", "and essentially each one of these", "09:56", "scientists I'm asking essentially the", "10:00", "same questions I'm saying hey do you", "10:02", "believe the anti-doping system in sport", "10:05", "works and every single one of them said", "10:08", "no and I said do you believe that you", "10:13", "can catch an athlete who is doping and", "10:17", "every single one of them told me no I", "10:20", "said do you believe that you could still", "10:23", "essentially do what Lance Armstrong did", "10:26", "and get away with it with the proper", "10:28", "advisers and every one of them said to", "10:30", "me yes and then I would pose the", "10:33", "question to each one of these guys I", "10:35", "said are you able would you have this", "10:39", "knowledge to advise me how to", "10:42", "essentially evade positive detection and", "10:45", "the vast majority of them said yes and I", "10:49", "said but will you do that and they said", "10:52", "no and they said the biggest variable is", "10:56", "that you've got to get your samples into", "10:59", "a water lab a world anti-doping agency", "11:02", "lab and that becomes very difficult", "11:05", "because if you can just", "11:06", "get your samples in to Waddle lab", "11:07", "amateur professional anybody right well", "11:10", "you can start figuring out all the you", "11:14", "know loopholes and what you can do and", "11:16", "what you can't do if you can essentially", "11:18", "know how to be tested so the variable", "11:21", "was how is gonna get my samples into a", "11:23", "water lab and I start talking to a", "11:26", "scientist here by the name of Don Catlin", "11:29", "in Los Angeles and he's considered the", "11:32", "grandfather of Anti Doping he created", "11:35", "all the tests for the first tests for", "11:39", "steroid detection and sport and he", "11:40", "actually is the first guy who did the", "11:44", "testing for the 1984 Olympics in Los", "11:47", "Angeles which was the first time they", "11:48", "ever did anti-doping testing in sport so", "11:52", "Catlin has developed all these tests and", "11:54", "and I get in touch with Catlin and he's", "11:57", "retired he's still alive I think he's", "12:00", "about 80 years old and he retired I", "12:03", "don't know five six years ago", "12:05", "and I quickly realized and talking to", "12:08", "Catlin that he's he's very frustrated he", "12:11", "basically is felt that he spent his", "12:13", "entire life and career in a system that", "12:17", "he was never gonna win at and that no", "12:20", "matter what he did and he would develop", "12:23", "one methodology to catch somebody the", "12:26", "very next day there'd be another way", "12:27", "around it and then he would develop", "12:29", "another methodology and then the very", "12:30", "next day there'd be someone around it or", "12:32", "he would propose that the league or the", "12:36", "NFL or you know baseball or wherever you", "12:40", "want to say should use this test to", "12:42", "catch you know this sort of substance", "12:45", "abuse and the league's would not use", "12:48", "that test intentionally or he would find", "12:51", "positives and report the positives and", "12:55", "then be told", "12:56", "basically to you know pretend that there", "12:59", "wasn't the positive because his job was", "13:01", "simply to report not to police and he", "13:05", "had spent an entire career with this and", "13:07", "and so he has you know I think a lot of", "13:11", "frustrations with the anti-doping system", "13:15", "and he said that he wouldn't help me", "13:18", "because a he would have had to prescribe", "13:20", "me drugs and he didn't want to be liable", "13:22", "for that B he didn't know how he was", "13:25", "gonna get my samples into a water lab", "13:27", "because he doesn't have access to that", "13:28", "anymore and he was worried about his", "13:31", "legacy he didn't want to as much as he", "13:34", "felt all the fallacies in the system he", "13:37", "didn't want to be out there you know", "13:39", "basically almost in a way making a", "13:41", "mockery of of all of his work and he", "13:45", "says hey I know this scientists in", "13:47", "Russia Gregory were chenkov he runs the", "13:50", "waffle lab the world anti-doping agency", "13:52", "lab for all of Russia and I think he", "13:55", "might help you and you know essentially", "13:58", "he said that because he knew that the", "14:02", "Russians had you know always been kind", "14:04", "of trying to to to figure out ways to", "14:08", "game the system and and he had met", "14:11", "Gregory in like 1983 and that's a whole", "14:15", "other story because Gregory had", "14:17", "basically come to the United States as a", "14:19", "spy to figure out what the Americans", "14:22", "were gonna beat him against in the 1984", "14:25", "Olympics which I can talk about later", "14:27", "but I get in touch with Gregory connects", "14:32", "us through email and I start emailing", "14:33", "Gregory and we spend about eight months", "14:37", "back and forth on emails halls at the", "14:40", "time he had just done the Sochi Olympics", "14:43", "so he was doing all the testing for the", "14:44", "Sochi Olympics and he invites me out to", "14:47", "Oregon and this is July of 2014 to go", "14:50", "meet him he's lecturing at this", "14:52", "symposium and he doesn't know at the", "14:55", "time that I want a dope he just thinks", "14:57", "that I'm a American filmmaker making a", "14:59", "documentary exploring the anti-doping", "15:01", "system it's poor so I go out to Oregon", "15:04", "and I make a decision that I'm not going", "15:07", "to bring my camera crews I'm not going", "15:10", "to you know do anything other than to", "15:12", "just meet him and we start talking and I", "15:16", "say to Gregory and he had just finished", "15:18", "the Sochi games I said do you believe", "15:21", "that a medal in the Olympics can be won", "15:26", "without performance-enhancing drugs and", "15:29", "he goes no", "15:31", "and I say why and he says well I should", "15:36", "believe I tried to believe but I don't", "15:39", "believe medal in the Olympics can be won", "15:42", "without performance-enhancing drugs and", "15:44", "then he takes this pause I'll never", "15:47", "forget this and he goes I don't know", "15:49", "maybe I'm a bad man and he says this to", "15:53", "me and and that you know was this moment", "15:57", "where I went okay clearly there is a", "16:00", "deeper story here that the the head of", "16:04", "the anti-doping laboratory in Russia's", "16:07", "telling me that a he doesn't think you", "16:09", "can win an Olympic medal cleanly and B", "16:12", "he doesn't know whether or not he's a", "16:14", "bad man", "16:15", "and what was going through your head it", "16:19", "was like I think I just hit the mother", "16:22", "lode for her for for what will be a", "16:27", "riveting film and not just a really hit", "16:31", "film and the changes noble story and and", "16:36", "and I say to him and we had really", "16:39", "bonded him and I really like the guy", "16:42", "like just which is he's as you see in", "16:43", "the film", "16:44", "I mean he's impossible not to like yeah", "16:47", "and I like him", "16:48", "I liken him kind of like Bryan Cranston", "16:51", "and Breaking Bad I mean he's his guy", "16:52", "who's living this you know he's you love", "16:56", "him and at the same time he's doing", "16:58", "things that he shouldn't be doing and", "17:01", "he'd been living this double life his", "17:03", "entire life was living a double life", "17:05", "which is which is insane and he agrees", "17:08", "that he's going to help me dope and", "17:11", "avoid detection but before this he", "17:16", "agrees but he's not admitting to", "17:18", "anything no not admitting Danny so he's", "17:20", "just showing you how it he just says", "17:21", "buddy buddy but he says look you know", "17:23", "you're an amateur cyclists you're not a", "17:27", "professional and in his mind even though", "17:30", "I was quote-unquote cheating I wasn't", "17:33", "cheating anyone out of anything right", "17:36", "and you were doing it very openly yeah", "17:38", "and I was doing it very openly and and", "17:41", "so he viewed it as kind of like hey this", "17:43", "is this is a cool project", "17:45", "to get involved in and in his mind I", "17:48", "think he also looked at it is hey what's", "17:50", "the big deal if I expose the fallacies", "17:53", "in the anti-doping system because maybe", "17:55", "they'll actually do something about it", "17:58", "if I show you know essentially how it", "18:01", "doesn't work so he agrees that he's", "18:04", "gonna be my doping adviser and this is", "18:06", "now July 2014 but I had to do the race", "18:09", "clean first I then had to go and you", "18:13", "know through this whole thing and I", "18:14", "wasn't gonna actually start doping until", "18:16", "essentially the beginning of the next", "18:19", "year and beginning of 2015 so you had to", "18:22", "do the race clean to get a base yeah to", "18:24", "do and because my whole premise was hey", "18:26", "I'm gonna do this race twice I mean", "18:28", "right go on it in doing cleaned see how", "18:30", "good I do and then the next year I'm", "18:32", "gonna go in just dope to the gills with", "18:35", "the hope that I'm gonna win it", "18:36", "now how much cycling had you done before", "18:38", "this a lot a lot", "18:40", "I grew up racing when I was 13 I'd raced", "18:43", "seriously ties nineteen but then I moved", "18:47", "out to LA I wasn't huge like a horrific", "18:51", "bike crash and I was 19 in a race and", "18:54", "that essentially I guess I didn't have", "18:58", "the balls after that I went back and", "19:00", "raced and no happier I lost eight teeth", "19:03", "all of these were shattered this one was", "19:07", "knocked out entirely and and it was like", "19:11", "it was a bad wreck and I was 19 I just", "19:15", "my freshman year in college and some", "19:18", "went through college basically with", "19:19", "plastic teeth in my mouth as I was going", "19:21", "through essentially like reconstructive", "19:23", "dental work and it made me really think", "19:26", "twice about being a professional athlete", "19:28", "or pursuing cycling and I came back to", "19:32", "it the following year and as you know", "19:35", "you know you in any sort of competitive", "19:38", "realm of sport you can't be thinking", "19:40", "about whether or not you're gonna get", "19:41", "injured you can't be thinking about what", "19:44", "those risks are you have to you know be", "19:45", "fully committed or you're gonna lose or", "19:47", "you're gonna get dropped and and I found", "19:49", "myself you know not following the wheel", "19:52", "close enough I found myself holding back", "19:54", "on descent I found myself like in my", "19:56", "mind of oh my god what if this crash", "19:58", "happened", "19:58", "again and so I decided to stop racing", "20:01", "and moved out to LA I got into the", "20:04", "entertainment business now I was doing", "20:06", "stand-up

being", "34:02", "watched by billions of people you think", "34:06", "that China is a great country look what", "34:08", "we're able to do and on top of that they", "34:11", "needed to win because

got a", "35:18", "state-sponsored program as well well I", "35:20", "personally don't have the evidence", "35:23", "according to Gregory and I have no", "35:26", "reason to doubt Gregory especially

Beijing China swept swept", "35:48", "those Olympics just like Russia swept", "35:50", "their own Olympics and and and according", "35:55", "to Gregory what the Russian what the", "35:57", "Chinese athletes would do is they would", "36:00", "show up for their you know their doping", "36:02", "tests and certain collectors meaning", "36:06", "when the athlete shows up they have to", "36:08", "be

"36:29", "government agents essentially like you", "36:31", "know Secret Service for China and that", "36:34", "the athlete would go in to have his you", "36:36", "know urine collected and this agent", "36:38", "would give the athlete a bag of his", "36:41", "clean urine and the athlete would put", "36:43", "that urine under his armpit and then", "36:45", "collect collect the urine and and that's", "36:50", "apparently what China did in the Beijing", "36:53", "Olympics according to Gregory and he had", "36:55", "knowledge of that and that is where the", "36:58", "idea started to come for how to put into", "37:02", "place what they ultimately did in Sochi", "37:05", "where they swapped out clean urine for", "37:08", "dirty urine but they did it in a much", "37:10", "more complicated manner because of the", "37:13", "camera systems because of all the", "37:14", "technology that was in place Russia took", "37:18", "it to a whole other step further those", "37:20", "lids that they had used those supposedly", "37:22", "unbreakable lids or on unremovable lids", "37:25", "yes had they been in place before Sochi", "37:28", "yes yes so what we're talking about is", "37:33", "in the in when an athlete reports for a", "37:38", "drug test in sport they pee into one", "37:42", "like like", "37:43", "you know a cup and then they separate", "37:46", "their urine between an a sample and a B", "37:49", "sample and these two bottles are made by", "37:51", "the Swiss company called bourlingueur", "37:53", "and they are kind of the Fort Knox of", "37:56", "urine collection bottles they've created", "37:58", "this tamper proof top it seals like it's", "38:02", "a vault and this has been considered the", "38:04", "global standard there it is right there", "38:07", "we could say yeah I'm screaming and", "38:09", "these are considered the the global", "38:11", "standard and world sport and they're", "38:15", "unpenetrated to be open by the lab right", "38:24", "so they have a machine that's this", "38:26", "special machine it cracks the top and", "38:29", "then you can test it the B sample is", "38:32", "sealed forever it's only to be opened if", "38:36", "the a sample turns positive and that B", "38:39", "sample is put into long-term storage for", "38:41", "ten years basically should testing", "38:44", "evolve or whatever or something come up", "38:46", "they have this B sample to go back and", "38:48", "test that athlete's urine up to ten", "38:51", "years in the Olympic vault in the", "38:54", "Olympic you know labs where they've", "38:57", "holding these samples so basically what", "39:00", "Russia figured out is that they need it", "39:03", "to swap out both the a urine and the B", "39:06", "urine but in order to get into those B", "39:09", "samples they had to break into these", "39:12", "bottles so through a couple years of", "39:15", "testing and the FSB got involved in a", "39:18", "program where they figured out using", "39:21", "these tools how to essentially break", "39:23", "into these bottles undetected dump out", "39:27", "the dirty dirty piss put in clean piss", "39:30", "and reseal these bottles", "39:31", "so both the a sample would be negative", "39:34", "because that was swapped and the B", "39:36", "sample had been swapped and it was in", "39:38", "long-term storage so does every sample", "39:41", "cuz if so if they removed the top of the", "39:43", "beast when they swap that out what do", "39:44", "they do with the a sample well the a", "39:46", "sample they they were they were legally", "39:48", "able to open it for testing but it was", "39:52", "supposed to be tested under you know a", "39:54", "bunch of other people watching", "39:57", "so what they would do and this gets into", "39:59", "into detail into the film is that they", "40:02", "would take basically the a sample that", "40:05", "was already in this room they'd smuggle", "40:07", "in the B sample the B sample shouldn't", "40:09", "even been there and they would crack", "40:11", "open the a sample like they were allowed", "40:14", "to crack open for testing but they would", "40:16", "do this at like two o'clock in the", "40:17", "morning and they would bring this a", "40:20", "sample and the B sample through a secret", "40:22", "hole in the wall of the room where there", "40:25", "where they were Alec quadding the urine", "40:27", "there's there's the holes in the wall", "40:29", "and they would pass these vowels through", "40:32", "the hole in the wall and once they got", "40:34", "through the hole in the wall", "40:36", "on the other side in this makeshift room", "40:38", "which was a look like a storage closet", "40:41", "but there were no cameras in there and", "40:42", "they had designed the whole lab for this", "40:44", "I mean this was there was a lot of", "40:46", "thinking that went into this blueprints", "40:48", "I mean Gregory showed me the blueprints", "40:50", "I mean this was this was thought out", "40:51", "years ahead of time how to do this and", "40:54", "they would swamp they'd bring the", "40:56", "bottles into this storage room", "40:57", "they would dump out the dirty urine of", "41:00", "the a sample because that was open they", "41:03", "would put in the clean urine of that", "41:05", "same athlete that they had collected", "41:07", "about a year earlier they would they", "41:09", "took all the athletes off the drug and", "41:11", "would have them collect clean samples", "41:13", "and then the B bottle would go out", "41:16", "secretly to

"43:21", "essentially detect steroid use about it", "43:26", "was about a six week window something", "43:28", "about that right and once you you hadn't", "43:30", "been taking steroids for about six weeks", "43:32", "you work in the test positive he", "43:34", "develops this test that is able to", "43:36", "detect steroid use up to like seven or", "43:38", "eight months in the system and this is", "43:41", "different types of steroids correct", "43:42", "because some steroids have a long life", "43:45", "right inside the body they're fat", "43:46", "soluble exactly so he's able to",

this long term", "44:19", "metabolite test that's catching all", "44:21", "these athletes from all over the world", "44:22", "because now they can catch him up to six", "44:25", "seven months he

a", "44:49", "solution of alcohol and what he figured", "44:51", "out through the science is that if the", "44:53", "steroids were taking with alcohol they", "44:55", "wouldn't actually go into the blood", "44:57", "system so you would get all the benefits", "44:59", "of a steroid but your body would pass it", "45:02", "out in a very very quick time and so you", "45:04", "were undetectable what yeah Wow how'd he", "45:10", "figure that out because he's a genius so", "45:13", "Wow so so so this guy is you know", "45:17", "essentially you know at one time you", "45:20", "know so he's figuring out so all the", "45:22", "Russian athletes are basically knowing", "45:27", "you know they're on his system and so", "45:30", "there's taken steroids while the other", "45:32", "athletes if they were

insane like I've never this is", "49:27", "unprecedented and then it went away then", "49:31", "it went away and and what you see in the", "49:34", "film and what's going on right now which", "49:35",

going to the New York Times and", "49:53", "us presenting all this evidence they", "49:55", "launched this three months investigation", "49:58", "and I'm essentially behind the scenes", "50:02", "kind

all at the same time and and", "50:32", "and so this investigation goes on for", "50:35", "two and a half months and during this", "50:38", "investigation", "50:39", "richard mclaren gets the samples the the", "50:42", "sochi samples out of the long-term", "50:44", "storage from b Olympics the IOC and", "50:47", "Luzon they do forensics on these bottles", "50:50", "and they see the scratches on

the bottles and they see all the", "51:03", "evidence on the bottles and then they", "51:05", "also find an extraordinary amount of", "51:10", "salt content in the urine because what", "51:12", "Gregory was doing which we don't get", "51:13", "into the film is in order to make the", "51:16", "clean urine match he also had to adjust", "51:18", "the gravity of the urine and he would", "51:21",

"51:30", "are what you ate that day the gravity", "51:33", "essentially the weight of your urine", "51:34", "changes basically what the content of", "51:38", "what what's what what your body is that", "51:40", "while are dehydrated people have dark", "51:42", "your exact is that a thicker urine is", "51:44", "actually it's like a heavier urine ah", "51:46", "right so so every athlete when they", "51:49", "would give their sample part of the", "51:51", "doping control forms they mark the", "51:53", "specific gravity essentially the weight", "51:55", "the biologic of the airport is that a",

"52:05", "urine well they're they're measuring", "52:08", "part of when they do the intake form on", "52:10", "the urine they weigh oh aliquot and so", "52:14", "that so that it's also another thing", "52:16", "against fraud because okay so your", "52:19", "specific gravity is I'm making this up", "52:21", "point o2 oh and that's in that sample", "52:24", "well so if they were to go back and", "52:26", "retest that sample and the specific", "52:29", "gravity was wrong well they'd know that", "52:30", "something was that something was up", "52:32", "right so part of swapping the urine is", "52:35", "he would also adjust the specific", "52:37", "gravity with with table salt he figured", "52:39", "out that salt salt would would change", "52:42", "the gravity of urine so because he's", "52:45", "trying to match on the doping control", "52:47", "forms exactly you know what's in these", "52:50", "bottles he puts in table salt and when", "52:52", "they go back and test these samples", "52:54", "sure enough in 100% of the samples they", "52:58", "test they find evidence of the scratches", "53:00", "they find evidence of tampering and they", "53:02", "find the table salt in the urine

you're talking about this", "100:06", "state-sponsored Russian you know doping", "100:10", "program I mean you have to really think", "100:12", "and include Karelin in that because he", "100:14", "was

and it gets very", "101:30", "very tricky because you talk", "101:32", "essentially about not just illegal", "101:34", "activity not just cheating but", "101:36", "potentially assault and what if someone", "101:38", "dies like what if someone is doping and", "101:41", "it's proven that they're doping and the", "101:44", "beating they give their opponent leads", "101:45", "to that opponent

would think that they", "124:01", "were being protected because they", "124:03", "thought that they were on the state", "124:04", "state program so they think that they're", "124:06", "being protected

mean I'm banned you told you told me", "124:17", "I'd be negative be like you're positive", "124:21", "Jesus well they were always positive so", "124:23", "it was just a matter of of of who to",

break into", "124:48", "these bottles and swap the urine but he", "124:51", "personally was never doing that what he", "124:53", "would do is the FSB these guys would", "124:57", "come in they had this device and like", "124:59", "once a week whenever they needed to do", "125:01", "it they'd come in and swap out all these", "125:03", "B samples that they would keep in", "125:05", "storage you

right that moment so they'd keep it", "125:16", "for a week or whatever and then the guys", "125:18", "would come in and they would swap out", "125:19", "all the samples so part of this system", "125:22", "was as he kept a urine database so he", "125:27", "had 16,000 matching urine samples that", "125:33", "he was holding in the laboratory that", "125:35", "they should have all been disposed of", "125:36", "after three months according to the code", "125:38", "so any international athlete that would", "125:40", "come into Russia to compete in the games", "125:42", "kids gymnast anybody

database know the urine is", "125:57", "being kept frozen so they would always", "125:59", "have samples to swap for any of the", "126:01", "Russian athletes at any time", "126:03", "even if they didn't have a clean sample", "126:06", "for that athlete so because most of", "126:09", "Russian athletes they were on the", "126:10", "program in Sochi they took extraordinary", "126:12", "precaution they collected clean urine of", "126:15", "each of the athletes on the program but", "126:18", "outside of that what they were doing was", "126:20", "just going hey we have 16,000 samples to", "126:24", "choose from so whatever is gonna best", "126:27", "match the Russian athlete to swap with", "126:29", "we can take the urine of another athlete", "126:32", "you know a clean athlete and make it", "126:35", "look you know pretty much identical to", "126:38", "that Russian athletes because they could", "126:39", "choose from 16,000 samples Wow", "126:41", "so they had it all index as far as the", "126:44", "weigh-in index everything they have a", "126:46", "like color profile and everything it was", "126:48", "crazy I got to see a spreadsheet and", "126:50", "then on the eve of this investigation", "126:53", "braking and and wada is gonna go raid", "126:57", "this laboratory and there's thousands of", "127:00", "missing samples and and then the report", "127:02", "this this report this 335 page report", "127:05", "trying to remember it was something like", "127:07", "1,400 samples are missing are 1,400", "127:11", "samples were destroyed well the real", "127:13", "number was 8200 something it was truly", "127:19", "1618 eight thousand samples matching and", "127:22", "two bottles 16,000 samples and they had", "127:24", "to bring in these containers industrial",

because", "137:44", "right now we're already in an era where", "137:46", "almost anything is discoverable anything", "137:49", "you know nothing nothing is private", "137:53", "anymore and there's always something to", "137:55", "come out and then there's some sort of", "137:57", "electronic trail of it right I mean even", "137:59", "in the now which we don't which I you", "138:03", "wouldn't know about the film but the way", "138:06", "that that evidence was truly", "138:07", "corroborated was the electronic trail", "138:10", "and here's the amazing thing in which", "138:11", "people probably don't realize is so like", "138:14", "Gregory when he comes to the US he had", "138:16", "erased all of his phones because he was", "138:18", "under the ministry order to erase", "138:20", "everything and and what was happening is", "138:23", "the athletes were snapping a photo of", "138:25", "their doping control forms so that's how", "138:28", "Gregory would know what what number", "138:30", "corresponding to what athlete I mean", "138:31", "this was very intricate how this was", "138:33", "going down because nobody in the lab you", "138:36", "know which you know if you're the", "138:37", "scientist and you're getting Armstrong", "138:39", "sample you don't know it's Armstrong", "138:40", "sample it's numbered it's got a seven", "138:42", "eight digit number on it's just a random", "138:44", "number but so what the Russians were", "138:46", "doing they were snapping a photo of", "138:48", "their doping control form which only", "138:50", "they could do right and then they were", "138:52", "sending this photo to an FSB agent who", "138:57", "was also a coach and she would send the", "139:00", "photo to Gregory and the KGB guy in the", "139:03", "in the lab who was assisting him and so", "139:06", "that they would know that that number", "139:08", "number one one seven four four", "139:10", "correspond to this athlete right the", "139:14", "point that I'm getting at is that so he", "139:17", "was", "139:18", "erased all of that they told him to", "139:20", "erase it all from his phone all of his", "139:21", "computers everything and when he comes", "139:23", "here he brings his old computer and he", "139:25", "brings his old phones because this guy", "139:27", "he just knows and when he turns over all", "139:31", "the evidence to towada",

that", "139:47", "was on his phone and computer and", "139:49", "retrieve it Wow and that's like a", "139:55", "massive portion of this evidence well", "139:58", "what they were also able to do is what", "140:00", "we probably don't realize and and this", "140:02", "goes into what you're saying is like", "140:03", "when you send an email if you've got the", "140:06", "the metadata behind it so like he was", "140:10", "getting email sent through the Russian", "140:11", "Ministry so you're sitting there going", "140:12", "well how do you know where this came", "140:15", "from they can go back in the actual", "140:19", "through the metadata that is being sent", "140:21", "in a computer and show exactly from what", "140:24", "computer where date/time that email was", "140:29", "sent and that's how they were able to", "140:30", "corroborate all his evidence through", "140:32", "through basically forensics of you know", "140:36", "whatever whatever that study is of", "140:38",

"140:46", "you take on your phone even if you", "140:48", "delete it they can get it back and they", "140:49", "can figure out exactly where you were", "140:52", "where it was sent how it was sent the", "140:54", "spot that you sent it from where it's", "140:56", "nuts and it's gonna get crazier just", "140:58", "gonna get crazy I mean for sure there's", "141:00", "gonna be some new technology just a", "141:01", "couple of years from now that's gonna", "141:02", "make it even easier to do than that it's", "141:05", "and when you read about you know there's", "141:07", "all these apps with encryption software", "141:08", "and stuff and I may have given up the", "141:11", "idea that that I you know that you can", "141:15", "be essentially invisible or they rock", "141:17", "and you know that if somebody wants to", "141:20", "get your information they're gonna get", "141:21", "your information", "141:22", "yeah unquestionably and you know another", "141:25", "thing that's really interesting is that", "141:26", "we're looking at photos when we're", "141:27", "looking at video and email and we're", "141:30", "assuming that this", "141:31", "gonna be in the future more access to", "141:33", "photo more access to email more access", "141:35", "to video but what what is coming down", "141:38", "the pipe I mean what what is the new", "141:40", "thing I mean there could be something", "141:42", "that's even fucking crazier than video I", "141:44", "mean what we're just assuming that it's", "141:47", "gonna stay video it's gonna stay photos", "141:49", "like why those things didn't even exist", "141:51", "a couple hundred years ago", "141:52", "well everything that's going now is is", "141:54", "going into this world of VR yes we're", "141:56", "essentially you know the you know the", "141:59", "idea is is that as you can see things", "142:01", "and you can create your own reality I", "142:04", "mean there's lots of discussion even in", "142:05", "the in the world of sex that you know", "142:08", "the sex of the future is", "142:09", "why do you really need a another human", "142:13", "you can essentially simulate that and", "142:16", "program it and make it everything you", "142:18", "wanted and more should never know the", "142:20", "difference", "142:21", "oh well I mean whether it's through", "142:23", "augmented reality virtual reality or", "142:25", "robots I mean we're we're just a few", "142:27", "steps away from all this stuff and if", "142:30", "it's not 10 years from now it's 50 if", "142:33", "it's not 50 it's a hundred it's", "142:34", "inevitable human beings don't destroy", "142:37", "ourselves we stay alive long enough", "142:39", "we're gonna see a complete dissolving of", "142:43", "reality as we know it which I think even", "142:45", "goes into like the whole Anti Doping", "142:48", "world of it in sports where you know you", "142:51", "actually just made me think about like", "142:53", "terminator yeah where you're sitting", "142:55", "there going well wait you think it's a", "142:57", "real person and and then it's a", "143:01", "terminator but you think of all the", "143:02", "technologies that are going on right now", "143:04", "and why won't there be a chip yeah in in", "143:08", "your brain that basically takes away", "143:11", "pain so that you can you know persevere", "143:14", "in an MMA fight that takes away your you", "143:17", "know yeah at all all these different", "143:19", "technologies that are essentially create", "143:22", "you know controlling your synapses", "143:23", "controlling your reflexes all it's all", "143:26", "there yeah and how is that not going to", "143:28", "happen and then obviously in enhancing", "143:30", "the human body itself I mean there was a", "143:32", "technology that we've been talking about", "143:34", "recently where they were trying to", "143:36", "combine spider silk with human skin", "143:39", "tissue to make an artificial skin a", "143:42", "replacement skin that's bulletproof", "143:44", "Wow let's just blew my mind", "143:48", "yeah that just blew my mind yeah they're", "143:50", "they're going to genetically engineer", "143:51", "human skin so it'll look like human skin", "143:54", "it'll have much of the same properties", "143:56", "of human skin but it'll be bulletproof", "143:58", "because you're wear it it'll be you", "144:00", "it'll be you you will replace your skin", "144:03", "and then how do they stop I mean that", "144:06", "the power of that bullet would still", "144:08", "like well yeah it did well sure you", "144:10", "could do some some tissue trauma", "144:12", "underneath the surface but the actual", "144:15", "skin itself won't break it'd be like", "144:17", "having a bulletproof vest all of your", "144:19", "body I mean that's what Kevlar", "144:20", "essentially is what Kevlar is is a", "144:22", "material that is so dense and so it's so", "144:26", "thick and so impenetrable that when you", "144:29", "shoot a regular bullet into it the", "144:30", "regular bullet hits it does not go", "144:32", "through it and just spreads out and", "144:34", "expands it's still very painful for the", "144:36", "person who gets shot but it protects", "144:38", "your life and we could easily see that", "144:40", "happen with entire bodies made out of", "144:42", "that stuff I mean you got to believe", "144:44", "it's priority out there like in some", "144:46", "secret lab they already like develop the", "144:49", "skin and use it in like a and like a", "144:51", "petri dish that's a bulletproof skin", "144:53", "yeah if I'm reading it on a science", "144:55", "website for sure I'm not the first one", "144:57", "to get the information I mean this is", "144:59", "getting to the highest level I mean", "145:01", "where is the real money right it's the", "145:03", "real question as I and I don't know this", "145:04", "answer is the the top scientists in the", "145:07", "world the top innovators in the world I", "145:09", "mean when do they scoop those people up", "145:11", "when does the government come in with", "145:12", "some some black ops money and say hey", "145:15", "you know we would like to hire you and", "145:17", "give you X amount of money to create", "145:19", "this and this is what we know so far", "145:21", "about that and you know here we're gonna", "145:24", "take you to groom Lake out in the middle", "145:25", "of Nevada and show you some lab that you", "145:27", "didn't even know existed yeah but you", "145:29", "got to believe that that's already way", "145:31", "into going on because there's nothing", "145:32", "that we spend more money on than", "145:35", "military should basically defense then", "145:38", "that this is what we spend money on yeah", "145:41", "that is actually you know I think as you", "145:44", "probably know the I read that the single", "145:47", "biggest export of the United States is", "145:50", "our weapons", "145:51", "yeah that's what we make and sell to the", "145:54", "rest of the world yeah we sell them and", "145:55", "stuff that's not as good as the stuff", "145:56", "we're making right now", "145:57", "right yeah we sell the world our weapons", "145:59", "and that's and and that is what is", "146:02", "employing like millions and millions of", "146:05", "people in this country is basically the", "146:07", "our military and our defense and", "146:09", "ultimately you know developing spider", "146:12", "skin yeah I mean this and this is what", "146:14", "we're seeing right this is what we get", "146:15", "to see and look at who knows how many", "146:17", "different programs are going on right", "146:18", "now as we're speaking that we have no", "146:21", "knowledge of whatsoever I mean when they", "146:22", "released stealth bomber and a couple", "146:25", "other there's these like sort of", "146:28", "experimental vehicles where they were", "146:30", "putting together these things and once", "146:32", "they they actually release them when", "146:34", "they actually put you know had press", "146:36", "conferences and showed people to they", "146:38", "had been working on these things forever", "146:39", "he was under wraps for like 20 years and", "146:42", "all of a sudden you see the singer like", "146:43", "whoa", "146:44", "have you ever seen one a person a", "146:45", "stealth you know no I was in Palmdale", "146:49", "and that's near Edwards Air Force Base", "146:51", "and we were filming fear factor out", "146:52", "there and this is right after September", "146:54", "11th and so they were doing all these", "146:56", "exercises and he seems were flying over", "146:57", "the desert it was like being in Star", "146:59", "Wars I mean once you see them in real", "147:01", "life you're like holy shit that's a", "147:03", "fucking UFO this black thing not shaped", "147:07", "like any plane you've ever seen before", "147:08", "flying across the sky", "147:10", "and you just look at it go what the fuck", "147:13", "is that thing yeah that's like 20 years", "147:16", "old now yeah all the shit I think about", "147:18", "what's out there oh yeah for sure", "147:19", "I mean well what's out there now I mean", "147:21", "they probably have some ridiculous stuff", "147:23", "and and then there's some theoretical", "147:25", "ideas you know there's some magnetic", "147:26", "drives they're trying to put together", "147:28", "there's some I mean there's there's a", "147:30", "bunch of speculation about different", "147:32", "types of weapons if they're trying to -", "147:34", "antimatter weapons and some things that", "147:36", "are just going to be able to just", "147:37", "completely annihilate anything they", "147:39", "touch and whether or not they're gonna", "147:40", "go completely through the earth if you", "147:42", "hit things I mean who knows who knows", "147:44", "what's on on the horizon I mean they're", "147:47", "just gonna keep getting better and", "147:48", "better at blowing shit up you know I", "147:50", "mean the the amount of power that we", "147:52", "have of the nuclear arsenal today and", "147:54", "the amount of power and the weapons in", "147:56", "comparison to the weapons that we used", "147:59", "in Hiroshima and Nagasaki it means it's", "148:01", "insane it's not even close I mean", "148:04", "they're they're hundreds and hundreds of", "148:06", "times more powerful now it's staggering", "148:08", "the to kind of understand what kind of", "148:10", "destruction is impossible like nothing I", "148:13", "don't think on the level of what we're", "148:15", "seeing a natural destruction of what", "148:16", "nature can do alone but yeah but it's", "148:18", "also fascinating when you think about", "148:20", "the implications that your your your", "148:22", "film is sort of brought to light is that", "148:24", "a lot of this destruction like when you", "148:26", "were talking about the Ukraine a lot of", "148:28", "this destruction and a lot of this", "148:30", "either the confidence that they have to", "148:33", "go into these places and and use these", "148:36", "weapons is kind of dependent upon public", "148:37", "opinion that's dependent upon sport", "148:40", "right and but dependent on basically", "148:42", "kicking somebody else's ass yeah without", "148:44", "the weapons yeah and then that allows", "148:46", "you to almost like weaponize because you", "148:49", "have the the power of the country behind", "148:51", "you it was a it was interesting is is", "148:57", "after Sochi and Putin's rating goes up", "149:00", "to you know 95 percent or something like", "149:03", "that that that everybody in Russia", "149:06", "supported him going into Ukraine to it", "149:08", "was this was a good idea", "149:11", "you know we're strong were powerful", "149:12", "let's go in and and take back at you", "149:15", "know a part of territory that that that", "149:17", "we lost let's go do it yeah and and and", "149:20", "you see that that that that sort of", "149:22", "nationalistic pride is real yeah I mean", "149:26", "I I grew up in in Colorado which is you", "149:30", "know Denver Bronco Territory and I mean", "149:34", "people would paint and they still do I", "149:36", "mean you know around football see you", "149:37", "driving around the city you see", "149:39", "thousands of houses painted in orange", "149:41", "and blue people in orange and blue I", "149:43", "mean it's it's literally it's a religion", "149:45", "it's a cult it is it is an ethos it is", "149:49", "and it's something to even fight about", "149:52", "yeah like I mean you talk bad about the", "149:55", "Broncos we're I mean that that's that's", "149:57", "that's a that's a point a fight yeah and", "149:59", "and I remember you know the few years", "150:01", "ago when the Broncos won the Super Bowl", "150:03", "and you're looking at like the statistic", "150:05", "was something like eighty five percent", "150:08", "of the city of Denver showed up for a", "150:11", "parade on a Monday", "150:13", "likes incredible whoa this is crazy and", "150:17", "this is what and this is what people so", "150:19", "if you don't believe that that the", "150:21", "governor or whatever the governor of", "150:23", "Colorado that day could

feel like", "151:06", "we're out of it simple I don't think you", "151:08", "can stop technology right I don't I just", "151:11", "don't think I think it's what we do I", "151:13", "mean I think if you if you looked at", "151:15", "human beings as a whole and you look at", "151:18", "what we used to be versus what we are", "151:20", "now if you were some sort of an", "151:22", "objective
