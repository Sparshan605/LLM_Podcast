vulnerable people to", "12:58", "become a part but I think the way they", "13:01", "deal with community yeah and the way", "13:03", "they deal with each other it's like over", "13:04", "it's a very warm and friendly and family", "13:07", "environment and most of the Mormons that", "13:08", "I've met that are practicing have been", "13:11", "very nice people yeah and they're and", "13:12", "they're serious about their tithing and", "13:14", "the 10% I mean they they have strict", "13:16", "rules about this like capital gains its", "13:18", "equivalent companies so if you sell your", "13:19", "house and", "13:20", "profit you got to get 10% of that to", "13:22", "church not just your income I asked your", "13:23", "paycheck yeah and they're pretty pretty", "13:26", "strict about that and the money as far", "13:28", "as I know mostly goes for good causes", "13:30", "that really does help poor people things", "13:33", "like that so now in your book", "13:35", "did you go over near-death experiences", "13:38", "what do you think is going on like when", "13:41", "people like the ones that have", "13:43", "fascinated me are people in the hospital", "13:45", "bed that see their body from above and", "13:48", "you're dealing with a bunch of chemicals", "13:50", "that are released in the body right", "13:51", "there's morphine and all sorts of", "13:53", "different things you know you know", "13:55", "psychedelic chemicals and all the all", "13:57", "these different things that are", "13:58", "happening while your brain is is", "14:01", "basically on the edge of death right so", "14:03", "it's important to remember that their", "14:05", "near-death experiences you're not", "14:06", "actually dead so there's there's a", "14:08", "luminal transitional stage there where", "14:11", "you're sliding into some other state of", "14:13", "consciousness an altered state of", "14:15", "consciousness and we know that if you", "14:17", "inject or you take hallucinogens you", "14:20", "know those are molecular molecules that", "14:23", "operate on a lock-and-key mechanism with", "14:25", "the synapses in your brain in your", "14:27", "neurons so if they these external drugs", "14:30", "work in this molecular lock-and-key", "14:32", "mechanism there must be natural", "14:34", "chemicals similar molecular lis to that", "14:37", "in the brain already just in smaller", "14:39", "doses so one theory about near-death", "14:41", "experiences is that is that this is a", "14:44", "way of transitioning from living to dead", "14:46", "without feeling anxious and falling", "14:48", "apart and upset and depressed or", "14:50", "whatever it's kind of a smooth feel good", "14:53", "you know better than a morphine drip", "14:54", "kind of way of making the transition and", "14:57", "but we know for example that this", "15:00", "scientist named dr. James whinnery", "15:03", "worked for the United States Air Force", "15:04", "working with pilots accelerating them in", "15:07", "a centrifuge and they would black out as", "15:08", "part of their training you know - jeez", "15:10", "3GS 4GS boom ouch ago at some point like", "15:14", "10 G's and most of them have these", "15:16", "little dream lit states that he called", "15:18", "them which are kind of like I saw a", "15:21", "tunnel a white light at the end of the", "15:22", "tunnel I felt myself floating out of the", "15:24", "seat and having these sort of weird", "15:26", "experiences and we know exactly what", "15:28", "that is you know the blood is being", "15:30", "compressed to the center of the body", "15:31", "including the center of the brain the", "15:33", "last thing to go

they poke around to see", "15:51", "where the seizures are starting and and", "15:53", "so they could you know zap those neurons", "15:55", "instead of some big crude attack anyway", "15:59", "so while they're doing that they get", "16:00", "permission from the patient to wake them", "16:01", "up while they're under and the brain is", "16:04", "open and they tap around with electrodes", "16:06", "so this is one way to map what the brain", "16:08", "is doing if you know so what do you", "16:09", "report when I tap here oh I just had a", "16:11", "vision of my tenth birthday or whatever", "16:13", "and it's like okay that's where that", "16:15", "that's stored right there well there's", "16:18", "another spot right on the temporal lobes", "16:20", "just above your ears where

long would you like to live you know", "71:58", "it's always about what the average", "72:01", "lifespan is now people oh yeah I think", "72:03", "I'd like to live in you know 82 or so", "72:05", "right but if we fast forward you to you", "72:07", "know 80 okay your time's up tomorrow's", "72:09", "your day no no wait sit give me another", "72:11", "week you know okay here's the okay", "72:13", "everybody I need another month you want", "72:15", "to run my first marathon yeah exactly", "72:17", "yeah I contend that it's a silly", "72:20", "argument that you know that do people", "72:22", "say well I think we should have a limit", "72:24", "on our lifespan and that we we need to", "72:26", "die you know but but but you personally", "72:29", "are you gonna check out when it's your", "72:30", "time no of course they wouldn't as long", "72:33", "as we're talking about being healthy and", "72:35", "cognitively aware then most people want", "72:38", "to continue severely depressed suicide", "72:41", "yes that's an issue but most people", "72:43", "would want to continue on so I that's a", "72:45", "point in favor of the transhumanist said", "72:47", "yeah people will want to keep going on", "72:49", "as long as they're healthy and happy and", "72:51", "leading fulfilled lives yeah as long as", "72:55", "everything's healthy my grandmother had", "72:57", "a stroke and they gave her 72 hours she", "73:01", "wound up living 12 years oh wow and it", "73:04", "was it was awful she had an aneurysm", "73:06", "oh the 12 years was awful I was off", "73:09", "it was horrific okay yeah I was really", "73:11", "bad she was bedridden she would moan she", "73:15", "was always in pain when she died it was", "73:18", "a relief for everyone in the family it", "73:20", "wasn't like oh we lost Graham right yeah", "73:23", "it was like grandma's in peace now right", "73:26", "like because for the longest time she", "73:28", "was in agony it was I stayed with them", "73:30", "when I first moved to do to New York", "73:33", "they lived in New Jersey and I lived", "73:35", "with them for a few months while I was", "73:37", "saving up money for an apartment and it", "73:39", "was horrific", "73:40", "and she would be moaning and yeah Rann", "73:43", "father had to take care of her and they", "73:44", "had a nurse would come over and take", "73:45", "care of her as well it was just well I", "73:47", "think you Europeans have a more advanced", "73:50", "humanist type perspective on that", "73:53", "euthanasia yeah physician assisted", "73:55", "suicide but they're doing that now in a", "73:57", "few states yes but there's still this", "73:59", "kind of sort of Christian ethic of you", "74:01", "know only God can decide that you can't", "74:03", "make those decisions and these are", "74:05", "people more like Christian conservatives", "74:07", "who otherwise think the government", "74:08", "should stay out of your life and you", "74:10", "make your own decisions and your take", "74:12", "personal responsibility except when it", "74:14", "comes to your death like wait a minute", "74:15", "why can't I choose that well they worry", "74:17", "about abuse okay fine just have rules", "74:19", "about you know you have to sign", "74:20", "something we have to like Kevorkian used", "74:23", "to videotape you know his patients", "74:25", "saying I to do this when they could", "74:27", "still do it anyway yeah so yeah I mean", "74:31", "how we deal with death it's a you know", "74:33", "it's a he'd always been a huge problem", "74:34", "it makes people uncomfortable and you", "74:37", "know how we talk about it matters and I", "74:39", "mean one of the motives for me writing", "74:41", "this book is like ever written about", "74:42", "science and pseudoscience science and", "74:43", "religion science and God signed some", "74:45", "morality but you know really this is", "74:47", "that the big question you know what", "74:49", "happens when you die and this is", "74:50", "something that you know that people", "74:52", "think about a lot or they've thought", "74:54", "about a lot for a long time and you know", "74:57", "so and nobody knows I contend you know", "75:00", "nobody knows for sure and so we write", "75:02", "these stories that kind of make us feel", "75:04", "better", "75:04", "the whole theory called terror", "75:06",

"artists and scientists are driven by", "75:18", "this fear of death but if you ask people", "75:20", "do you walk around in the state of fear", "75:22", "of death most", "75:23", "I don't so it okay it's unconscious okay", "75:26", "maybe but how do you know if it's", "75:28", "unconscious so we have these experiments", "75:30", "where they prime the brain sort of try", "75:31", "to trick it out of you and well mostly", "75:33", "aren't they most people busy they're", "75:35", "busy the fear of death comes when you're", "75:37", "laying alone at night right like what", "75:39", "there's gonna be a day when I don't wake", "75:41", "up right it's gonna maybe I'll die", "75:42", "tonight I'm sleeping but you never know", "75:45", "yeah you just you just it's just lights", "75:47", "out and that's that's the greatest way", "75:48", "to die ever", "75:49", "right go to sleep and don't wake up", "75:50", "that's right yeah yeah I'm dying your", "75:52", "bed peacefully yep yep that's good way", "75:55", "to go which is why you know Hospice is", "75:57", "probably you know a really good thing", "75:59", "that we're getting better at it in the", "76:00", "West yeah just helping people make that", "76:03", "transition which is why back to", "76:05", "near-death experiences it could be those", "76:07", "brain chemistry chemicals that's what", "76:09", "they evolved for was to help that", "76:11", "process as your brain is shutting down", "76:13", "you feel this sort of glow or this sort", "76:15", "of good feeling that you know there's a", "76:17", "tunnel you're gonna pass through the", "76:19", "sense of transitioning to some other", "76:20", "place and this starts off very early in", "76:23", "life I cite research by Paul bloom in", "76:26", "his lab at Yale with little kids so he", "76:28", "presents them with this little puppet", "76:30", "show and so you have this little mouse", "76:31", "and this alligator and the alligator", "76:32", "munches the mouse and he's dead where is", "76:35", "the mouse now oh the mouse is at this", "76:36", "other in this other place and he misses", "76:38", "his mom and he's hungry and he's scared", "76:40", "so and this is like preschoolers so it", "76:43", "starts pretty young at this dualistic", "76:45", "idea that something transcends the", "76:48", "physical body there's something else", "76:49", "that continues and I contend that that's", "76:51", "because you can't conceive of nothing", "76:53", "that runs just I don't perceive my own", "76:56", "brain operating so it feels like", "76:58", "thoughts are floating around up there", "76:59", "and I feel like a kind of a set of", "77:02", "patterns that would continue beyond the", "77:03", "physical body it feels that way so our", "77:06", "intuitions I think naturally lead to the", "77:08", "idea of some kind of afterlife or", "77:10", "something continues it is possible or is", "77:14", "it possible that all these different", "77:17", "cultures and all these different people", "77:19", "have these concepts because maybe", "77:21", "something does happen maybe some that's", "77:24", "right yeah it could be something could", "77:26", "possibly happen to whatever we think of", "77:28", "as consciousness that's whatever we", "77:30", "think of as you and I think most of our", "77:32", "consciousness is weighed down by life", "77:35", "experiences and genetics", "77:37", "in our environment and all the things", "77:39", "that we carry around in our head as", "77:42", "memories and I mean this is a big part", "77:44", "of what what your life is right you know", "77:47", "and at the the core of all that is the", "77:51", "self is you really the consciousness", "77:53", "whatever that means", "77:54", "right it's never been no one's ever been", "77:56", "able to take consciousness and we", "77:58", "extract it we put this in this beaker", "78:00", "and now we wait it right consciousness", "78:01", "is 28 grams or whatever they remember", "78:04", "that yeah stupid thing right yeah 20 21", "78:08", "grams yeah yeah 21 grams yeah but what", "78:12", "imagine if that was the case and before", "78:16", "that all happened you went and", "78:18", "downloaded your brain into some", "78:19", "supercomputer right so you got to use", "78:22", "you got one new that lives in hell on", "78:24", "earth living forever we're never going", "78:27", "to die just one mundane trip to", "78:30", "Starbucks after another and you just", "78:33", "checked out you're trapped in a computer", "78:35", "which is what Ray Kurzweil is saying", "78:37", "like what if like you what if they give", "78:40", "you the opportunity to be trapped in a", "78:41", "computer but you're trapped in an iPhone", "78:43", "one essentially once you're in you're in", "78:45", "like you can either wait and hang on for", "78:48", "a few years and you will get a really", "78:49", "good computer we're thinking quantum", "78:52", "computers are gonna live around 2030", "78:54", "2032 but we can get you in now I mean", "78:58", "you're looking pretty you're coughing a", "79:00", "lot Mike right I mean well it's like", "79:03", "with the cryonics people and I remind", "79:05", "people you know you're being frozen on", "79:07", "the worst day of your life you know the", "79:08", "day you died yeah and you can't do it", "79:11", "earlier because the state treats it as a", "79:12", "form of burial legally so you can't be", "79:14", "you know can't get the treatment and the", "79:16", "throat in the injected with the", "79:17", "antifreeze and all that before you're", "79:19", "actually dead or they inject you with", "79:21", "antifreeze yeah what type of antifreeze", "79:23", "and the purpose of that well you're dead", "79:26", "so it doesn't really matter", "79:27", "but the purpose is to keep the cells", "79:28", "from shattering because the freezing", "79:30", "process will do that so they've got much", "79:33", "better about that and what's actually", "79:34", "frozen is this sort of gelatinous mass", "79:37", "that's good that's vitrify it's called a", "79:39", "vitrification process so it's it's it's", "79:41", "a little bit like remember the taurine", "79:43", "the bodies would add the dissected", "79:46", "bodies and they were they were sort of", "79:47", "this hard plastic plasticine", "79:50", "yeah so this vitrification is sort of", "79:52", "like that yeah and then that's frozen", "79:54", "and as far as far as I'm concerned", "79:57", "everyone frozen today including Ted", "79:59", "Williams in his head in Arizona there", "80:02", "will never be brought back isn't Walt", "80:04", "Disney frozen no you know that's I try", "80:06", "that then turns out they al khor", "80:08", "cryonics foundation opened its doors and", "80:11", "released a press release the same day", "80:13", "Walt Disney died and these two stories", "80:21", "Williams one is sad because they didn't", "80:23", "have the money for the whole body so I", "80:25", "took his head right it actually isn't", "80:29", "that expensive because if you the way", "80:32", "the way Al Khor and the other words do", "80:34", "it is you take out an insurance policy", "80:36", "on your life and you make them the the", "80:38", "beneficiary of the insurance policy so", "80:40", "if you started young you had say a", "80:42", "quarter-million dollar insurance policy", "80:44", "a few hundred dollars a year premiums", "80:46", "you started super late the premiums", "80:48", "would be much higher but but it's not", "80:50", "like you're shelling out a quarter", "80:51", "million dollars right your checkbook", "80:53", "right and then when you do die what", "80:56", "happens if you get defrosted because", "80:58", "that has happened right haven't there", "80:59", "known well oh well what happens is you", "81:02", "look like a bowl of melted strawberries", "81:04", "that were frozen it's just this just", "81:06", "mush that happened to one of the", "81:09", "companies that does this they had a", "81:11", "power outage right yeah you don't want", "81:14", "that yeah I'm not sure whether in it Al", "81:16", "Gore is in Arizona I mean and there's", "81:23", "other deeper issues with this whole idea", "81:24", "because if you're gonna be frozen for a", "81:26", "thousand years or so what's to say that", "81:28", "the state of Arizona is going to be", "81:30", "around or the government or the company", "81:32", "that keeps the lights on the underwater", "81:33", "or anything get anything to transport", "81:37", "your body and some sort of one of the", "81:39", "big ol electric Tesla trucks big cooler", "81:42", "I'll send you to Mars yeah say so new", "81:45", "spot yeah and again we'd if they somehow", "81:51", "jump-started the body and would you wake", "81:53", "up like you just had a long sleep would", "81:55", "you still be in there I'm not at all", "81:58", "sure that you
