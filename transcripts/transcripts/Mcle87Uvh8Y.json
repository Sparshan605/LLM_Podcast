those people", "26:47", "because it's you have a weapon that's", "26:50", "visible and it doesn't have a fancy", "26:52", "biometric lock on it there's nothing", "26:54", "it's like if you're in a

to Walgreens but that's what", "27:21", "I'm saying", "27:22", "yeah it probably exists so that no one", "27:26", "can ever infringe upon your rights to", "27:28", "have one in any capacity so if you're", "27:30", "sure you know I'm saying it's like it's", "27:32", "not a thing where you want to do all the", "27:34", "time but if you if some shit goes down", "27:36", "and you have a gun

like for me I'm", "29:03", "like I'm a pragmatist", "29:05", "and and to me it's always about", "29:08", "awareness it's always about education", "29:09", "and the thing that the conversation", "29:11", "always breaks down on either side where", "29:14", "it's like if it's a gun then they're", "29:15", "like any hint of something that says", "29:18", "we're gonna have to talk about this you", "29:20", "know they're like no and then the people", "29:21", "who are really anti-gun they're like any", "29:23", "hint that there might have to be a", "29:25", "compromise made then they're

there's", "29:48", "illegal gun sales and black-market guns", "29:50", "and their problem with guns and they're", "29:51", "coming their communities all that stuff", "29:53", "needs to be talked about but but the", "29:56", "sides are so entrenched it's very very", "29:59", "very difficult well I think something", "30:01", "like what we're experiencing right now", "30:02", "these riots and the looting this opens", "30:05", "people's eyes this is like we were", "30:07", "talking about our liberal friends that", "30:08", "are very interested in getting a gun now", "30:10", "this opens people's eyes you realize", "30:12", "like this is not no one's on a power", "30:15", "trip you're just talking about your", "30:16", "ability to safely defend your loved ones", "30:18", "and yourself

but everything is so it's so it's", "110:03", "so hard to like feel like you can", "110:05", "communicate with police officers like", "110:07", "there's never a time when I get pulled", "110:08", "over and I know police officers but I", "110:10", "get pulled over I'm just immediately", "110:12", "terrified and also because I'm a black", "110:13", "man so like my immediate thing is like",

approaching I'm", "110:24", "like thinking about all of that stuff", "110:26", "that's happening which which sucks", "110:28", "because I'm sure some officers if they", "110:30", "knew that that's the way I felt they", "110:32", "would hate that", "110:33", "yeah cuz for them they're like I'm just", "110:35", "stopping you because this or or whatever", "110:38", "I don't want to be that person I know", "110:40", "that for those are officers that feel", "110:42", "that way it's gonna be tough but they're", "110:44", "they really need to like they need to be", "110:46", "the ones that are the majority or at", "110:48", "least that are made known to be the", "110:49", "majority and then from the cops", "110:51", "perspective anyone you pull over could", "110:53", "be the guy that shoots you of course", "110:54", "anyone you might get or it could be some", "110:56", "guy who's out on the warrant and yep and", "110:58", "you know you don't know if you're ever", "111:00", "gonna see your family again yeah also I", "111:02", "think there's a giant percentage of them", "111:04", "that are dealing with", "111:05", "just crippling PTSD yeah there's there's", "111:08", "definitely PTSD and there's also a lack", "111:11", "of communication to civilians to be able", "111:13", "to also pre pre deescalate you know", "111:17", "because so many videos that I watched", "111:19", "those dashcam footage is of people", "111:21", "saying like you know a cop coming up to", "111:22", "the window saying license and", "111:23", "registration and then their immediate", "111:25", "thing is what did what are you pulling", "111:27", "me over for and then the cop is like can", "111:29", "I just have your lessons and", "111:30", "registration and then they keep doing", "111:31", "that whether they have the legal right", "111:32", "which I believe that you actually do", "111:34", "have the legal right to ask for why", "111:35", "you're being pulled over why take the", "111:38", "risk", "111:39", "yeah you know the cop just wants to get", "111:41", "the the information and do their job and", "111:43", "whether they can do that or not if you", "111:44", "have it on camera got on camera their", "111:46", "conduct is on there anyways right so you", "111:49", "know and then what I tell everybody it's", "111:51", "like just survive that's that's that's", "111:53", "that's what you need to do in and that", "111:55", "goes for anybody whether you're white", "111:56", "black woman whatever it's like in", "111:58", "general like the attitude is like", "112:00", "survive this make the officer feel safe", "112:02", "and survive it you're not gonna", "112:04", "arbitrate it in that you haven't yeah", "112:06", "beep be polite be respectful yeah get it", "112:09", "over with and you still could run into", "112:12", "the wrong cop oh you can still run into", "112:14", "the wrong cop there's no doubt about it", "112:15", "no doubt about it but it's hard you know", "112:17", "but you have to hold the line that's", "112:19", "it's harder when everything's against", "112:21", "you and when everyone's expecting you to", "112:23", "do the wrong thing well one thing that's", "112:25", "a positive trend and this is not", "112:27", "something that you you know it's not", "112:30", "something that people really even want", "112:32", "to discuss after someone gets murdered", "112:33", "by the cops there has been a distinct", "112:36", "drop in people being killed by cops", "112:38", "since 2015 particularly in black men", "112:41", "being killed by cops there is a drop I", "112:44", "think I think it's one of those things", "112:46", "where whenever something like this", "112:49", "happens", "112:49", "that's a catalyst for change you know", "112:52", "it's almost like we need but first of", "112:54", "all how ironic is it that Colin", "112:58", "Kaepernick takes all that shit for", "113:00", "kneeling as I know I know and this", "113:03", "fucking guy kneels on this guy's neck", "113:06", "and proves the point he kills the guy by", "113:09", "doing the very thing that Colin", "113:12", "Kaepernick was criticized for it's going", "113:15", "down on one knee and doing it to a black", "113:17", "guy and killing him", "113:19", "yeah kind of fucking crazy it's because", "113:21", "it's similar it's sort of symbolic about", "113:24", "like look this is what they were talking", "113:26", "about this is the thing it's right here", "113:29", "in front of your face now you see it you", "113:31", "know you get it yep", "113:32", "I know yeah I mean just sign him oh

they're like", "113:54", "this is a bad precedent to set yeah I", "113:56", "don't know anything about football so I", "113:58", "don't know what his skill level was", "114:00", "whether or not he would mean those guys", "114:02", "get pushed in and out anyway", "114:05", "like the number of years that a guy can", "114:07", "play the average number of years that a", "114:09", "guy can play professionally in the NFL I", "114:11", "think it's like two yeah two or three", "114:13", "years yeah it's crazy cuz it's so brutal", "114:15", "yeah just and you know fresh young", "114:19", "hungry
