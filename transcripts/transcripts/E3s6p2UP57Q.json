day the", "06:47", "cause of disease transmission", "06:49", "cannibalism was outlawed and at that", "06:52", "point in time he broke completely the", "06:54", "disease transmission cycle so no more",

time a cow developed a TSE", "08:12", "apprentices whether it came from scrapey", "08:14", "the TSE of sheep or arose on its own is", "08:17", "unknown but that cow died it was", "08:20", "rendered

they can", "08:41", "persist they cannot be inactivated so", "08:44", "yeah it's you that's a goodness entirely", "08:46", "these prions are not necessarily a", "08:48", "living thing like a disease or a virus", "08:50", "or a bacteria well they're", "08:52", "disease-causing agent but they are", "08:54", "incredibly unique they're an ideological", "08:57", "like a virus of bacteria or you know a", "09:01", "parasite could be causing disease but", "09:04", "all these other things have genetic", "09:05", "material they're alive which allows them", "09:08", "to change rapidly to evolve over

"09:52", "whatever it's does and then the body", "09:54", "recycles breaks that chain of amino", "09:57", "acids down into its component parts and", "09:59", "recycles it turns out that normal",

all", "10:51", "thanks Jeff so if a deer sheds", "10:55", "infectious agent this prion protein and", "10:59", "so from the time of deer is infected", "11:02", "it's probably around two years before it", "11:04", "develops clinical signs a disease goes", "11:06", "downhill loses its fear of humans with", "11:09", "dramatic weight loss all of those things", "11:12", "that incubation period you

we've gotten all the deer", "11:44", "tested they were two and a half-year-old", "11:46", "bucks", "11:46", "perfectly it looked perfectly healthy", "11:48", "and these are the first ones that you",

"12:02", "some point they will at some point so", "12:04", "they could be spreading infectious", "12:05", "agents without testing positive yes", "12:08", "oh so it's a it's probably between three", "12:12", "and six months out when we can test an", "12:14", "animal test positive but it's likely", "12:17", "shedding infectious agent and we set", "12:19", "lower quantities prior to that point in", "12:22", "time and so then so it's shedding", "12:25", "infectious agent it's capable of", "12:27", "transmitting disease okay belong before", "12:30", "it looks clinically ill that's one of", "12:32", "the real challenges with this disease", "12:34", "from a management standpoint they look", "12:37", "perfectly healthy they act perfectly", "12:39", "healthy but they're starting to have",

period this could just", "13:10", "cascade and I think we've seen evidence", "13:13", "of that now started out you know we", "13:15", "talked about being isolated disease it", "13:18", "was picked up

should do something", "14:47", "it's an interesting story and you know", "14:50", "Norway's got experience with scraping", "14:52", "and sheep and so they have a long", "14:55", "history what a

"16:00", "sorry okay no worries so when they", "16:02", "picked up CWD and reindeer in Norway the", "16:06", "researchers over there had witnessed", "16:08", "what we are lack of success on this side", "16:12", "of the pond over the course of the last", "16:13", "20 years they took it very very", "16:15", "seriously", "16:17", "so they took kind of some harsh medicine", "16:19", "they announced their plans that they", "16:22", "were going to eliminate a herd unit they", "16:24", "were gonna kill every reindeer in an", "16:27", "entire herd unit in Norway the idea is", "16:30", "to eliminate the host population it's", "16:33", "called stamping out and it works in a", "16:35", "pen this is the first time it'd been", "16:37", "done", "16:38", "realistically in a free-ranging",

40", "16:59", "my liver area and but there were you", "17:02", "know and so they're very well localized", "17:04", "as probably none but at least they have", "17:06", "a range that they move through so and in", "17:08", "in Norway they have two or three", "17:11", "different herds many more than that so I", "17:13", "don't know exactly how many you can", "17:15", "isolate the herds so the idea is before", "17:18", "this gets be any worse before it gets", "17:20", "any farther let's take it out so they", "17:24", "had a hunting season they allowed", "17:25", "hunters to take as many as they could", "17:28", "with", "17:28", "was a little over a thousand reindeer", "17:30", "then they came in with government agents", "17:32", "but it's our concern that the hunters", "17:34", "could eat something with CWD and then", "17:37", "catch it well that's always a concern", "17:39", "but we can talk about him yeah let me", "17:42", "finish this it was with Norway in it so", "17:46", "they took literally took the bull by the", "17:47", "horns they decided to do what was very", "17:50", "unpopular what we have not been able to", "17:52", "do in North America they and so after", "17:55",

"18:13", "this disease in a free ranging herd", "18:14", "pretty different than what we've been", "18:16", "able to accomplish over here five years", "18:19", "is that uh I mean with it being in the", "18:21", "soil and dirt and from what I was", "18:25", "reading wood and everything else is that", "18:27", "so at some point there becomes the the", "18:31", "prions diminishing population or they", "18:35", "die out or whatever the proper word I", "18:37", "mean they're not living so they don't", "18:39", "die but finally becomes viable anymore", "18:41", "yeah five years is probably a pretty", "18:43", "good it's a guesstimate okay as well as", "18:45", "with regard to how long these prions", "18:47", "remain viable in in the environment and", "18:50", "in this substrate so it's a it's a good", "18:53", "first guess and what what they'll do", "18:55", "then is slowly allow reindeer to", "18:57", "repopulate and as they do they'll be", "18:59", "harvested periodically and every one of", "19:01", "those will be tested so I mean it'll be", "19:03", "a long-term experiment into you know", "19:07", "successful management and it will also", "19:08", "learn quite a bit about whether

it interesting", "20:43", "yeah and the reason why was the man ate", "20:45", "the meat and the women and children ate", "20:49", "the internal organs internal organs and", "20:52", "as well as

you know controls that", "30:43", "species barrier okay so I was telling", "30:46", "Doug", "30:47", "paper yesterday it's it's pretty good", "30:49", "it's pretty neat stuff guys relaxes", "30:51", "alright Zobrist so now it turns out mice", "30:55", "experimental laboratory mice their prion", "30:59", "protein has the same structure as the", "31:01", "human prion does okay so you cannot give",

this loop structure", "31:49", "is going to keep people from getting CWD", "31:52", "well the all the assumptions that people", "31:56", "can't get CWD are based that on this", "31:59", "idea that CWD is CWD and it will always", "32:02", "be exactly the same thing but our", "32:04", "experience with scrapey strongly", "32:06", "suggests that even though there's no", "32:09", "there's no DNA in

"36:37", "interesting questions so with regard to", "36:39", "transmission into cattle it's basically", "36:42", "the same situation as with humans no", "36:45", "evidence that it has but in an", "36:48", "experimental sense we can push it over", "36:50", "that species bear here okay now", "36:53", "interesting you bring up plants because", "36:56", "we have shown research that we've done", "36:59", "at the national wildlife health center", "37:00", "I've shown that if you grow some plant", "37:03", "types in a slurry a concentrate of prion", "37:07", "protein that those prions can be

okay so a", "38:02", "deer could eat those plants and that", "38:05", "could be one of the possible", "38:07", "transmission mechanisms so that's the", "38:09", "second one the third one has you know", "38:13", "speculated about and some folks have", "38:15", "looked at and and it has potential", "38:18", "impacts for agricultural commodities", "38:21", "so when CWD was you know 20 30 years ago", "38:25", "was really really rare he's probably", "38:27", "couldn't happen but now it's in 25", "38:29", "states vast geographic areas we have", "38:33", "just south of where he lives in adult", "38:36", "males nearly 50 percent prevalence so", "38:39", "when you kill that big buck take a coin", "38:41", "out of your pocket flip it in the air", "38:42", "and that's the odds at that deer s CWD", "38:44", "and when he says just south just 15", "38:48", "miles okay so now let's go out west or", "38:51", "something yes so let's go out when to to", "38:54", "overall in the county ass let's go up", "38:58", "into the the big agricultural areas in", "39:00", "Saskatchewan or out west okay so you got", "39:03", "a mule deer herd out there with CWD", "39:05", "let's say maybe 20% over all of that", "39:08", "hurt is CWD positive you've been out in", "39:12", "some of those big wheat fields and hay", "39:13", "fields how many mule deer are standing", "39:15", "out there before sunset shitload yeah", "39:18", "okay so take that amount times 20% or", "39:22", "that amount whatever percent to have CWD", "39:24", "figure out how many times it's a deer", "39:27", "defecate or urinate on a daily basis and", "39:29", "that's a bunch and now think about the", "39:33", "possibility that when you harvest those", "39:35", "agricultural food stuff", "39:36", "and roll it up into big bales that you", "39:39", "might have fecal material rolled up into", "39:42", "those big bales not just might right I", "39:45", "mean most likely we'd need a graduate", "39:48", "student that we could have you know pick", "39:50", "apart large bales of hay to really prove", "39:52", "that but I mean it's almost certainly so", "39:56", "now we're now we're putting those on", "39:58", "semi trailers and moving across borders", "40:01", "yeah and are those could is there a", "40:04", "possibility that these agricultural", "40:05", "commodities then deer could come up to", "40:09", "them and be infected by contact I think", "40:12", "we don't know Orton to say that Brian's", "40:16", "a scientist these other folks studying", "40:19", "that are scientists and they don't you", "40:22",

"40:31", "attacked yeah right because it's hard to", "40:34", "speaking in absolutes is a real hard", "40:36", "thing to do you know and so it's you'll", "40:39", "hear him say the evidence suggests yes", "40:41", "the information is this I just think", "40:43", "that's a real important distinction to", "40:46", "draw you're having those kind of", "40:48", "discussions you know they're people want", "40:50", "absolute proof proof is hard in a", "40:52", "biological world because there's so many", "40:55", "factors out there we can't control for", "40:57", "them all but there's certain

the whole", "41:09", "idea is to sow the seeds of doubt", "41:11", "there's a scene actually merchants of", "41:15", "doubt' we've seen that we see the same", "41:17", "thing going on with CWD so you mentioned", "41:20", "it earlier hey um you know CWD it's not", "41:24", "so bad what about winter kill", "41:26", "what about EHD so instead of focusing on", "41:29", "that saying don't look here look at this", "41:32", "one this one is worse why aren't you", "41:34", "doing something about this one so it's a", "41:36", "simple diversion another tactic which is", "41:39", "and that mean there's slot there's a", "41:40", "body it's not a scientific approach this", "41:42", "because these are unrelated issues like", "41:45", "EHD does kill animals winter kill most", "41:47", "certainly kills animals but we're not", "41:48", "talking about the same sort right", "41:50", "to divert the conversation right another", "41:53", "thing that's very easy to do is you know", "41:56", "it's cherry-picking the literature that", "41:58", "that's out there we saw a real great", "42:01", "example of this about a year ago where", "42:03", "there's a lot of letters to the editor", "42:05",

that's one of the", "44:12", "reasons why the deer populations are so", "44:14", "enormous in farmlands is because it's a", "44:16", "massive super perfect environment yeah", "44:18", "and it's also

me is", "44:30", "this potential for a pandemic disease", "44:34", "also comes with an incubation period and", "44:37", "that we are looking potentially at like", "44:40", "if you just objectively

"45:58", "range in terms of like their migration", "46:01", "that's one of the things that we've", "46:02", "realized I believe over the last decade", "46:05", "right is that mule deer travel far more", "46:07", "far longer and far longer distances", "46:10", "engage on and we just ate four", "46:13", "even whitetails can there's an", "46:15", "interesting research tidbit the state of",

certain", "48:43", "likelihood that you'll see outcome a or", "48:46", "a outcome B so if you keep rolling the", "48:49", "dice enough times you might see an", "48:51", "alternative outcome we cannot

Brian you put it as the chances are", "49:09", "very small at this point that it can and", "49:13", "this is what the CDC and the World", "49:15", "Health Organization says as well the", "49:17",

long", "50:09", "before you kill it like how long do well", "50:11", "I do grass-fed beef and Brian it's", "50:13", "actually kind of interesting you were", "50:15", "talking about the deer the

beef eat I", "50:27", "mean right you're not something like oh", "50:29", "yes the one since a little by the way oh", "50:33", "anyway but it's very controlled so even", "50:37", "though my dear could unaffected your cow", "50:40", "well and that they're they're not", "50:42", "organic right my cattle are right", "50:45", "because it is controlled how ironic oh", "50:48", "yeah yeah I mean you have farm animals", "50:52", "in captivity that are organic purely", "50:55", "eating grass this nature intended and", "50:57", "you got deer eating Monsanto corn yeah", "51:06", "and you know and before anybody out", "51:10", "there gets the idea that my cattle are", "51:11", "confined in a little barnyard area no", "51:13", "it's a big big large area a big pasture", "51:16", "they're you know they

one of the", "52:27", "precautionary measures is not allowing", "52:29", "cause to get old", "52:31", "Oh for mad cow disease well and from my", "52:34", "standpoint they're prime at 26 27 months",

with scraping", "52:49", "and sheep as well with BSC and I'm", "52:52", "clarify if CWD went into a cow in a in a", "52:56", "natural world we don't know exactly what", "52:59", "it would look like we know what it looks", "53:01", "like when we inject it into the brain of", "53:02", "a cow but we don't know what it would", "53:04", "really look like but BSE is quite", "53:07", "different in that",

you", "55:07", "don't want it so let's do what we can to", "55:11", "stop it from coming here that's why", "55:13", "you're seeing things like let's not", "55:15", "transfer carcasses that you know there's", "55:17", "bans on being able to transfer carcasses", "55:19", "in Wisconsin in some cases you can't", "55:22", "take it to another County you can take", "55:24", "the finished meat so you

stop the movement of", "55:39", "captive deer from one farm to the other", "55:43", "but that's just recent and and there", "55:45", "have been hearings on that lately so we", "55:47", "also people resist that right if your if", "55:51", "your economic vitality depends on", "55:55", "selling and moving live deer you're", "55:57", "going to be opposed to restrictions on", "55:59", "your economic

"56:53", "know Western Dane County and back in the", "56:55", "day my dad and a bunch of his buddies", "56:57", "used to go out to Colorado and they are", "57:00", "Wyoming's actually where they went and", "57:01", "they hunted elk and mule deer and it", "57:07", "bring the whole damn thing back I mean", "57:09", "just what you did right you put it on", "57:11", "the back of the truck and off you went", "57:12", "and then process time you can remember", "57:15", "doing it in the garage in Cazenovia as a", "57:17", "kid you know working there with knives", "57:19", "this is a great thing well

want to get it they", "57:52", "want to do everything", "57:52", "okay so these like what is it eastern", "57:54", "states or southeastern states and some", "57:56", "of the far western states haven't picked", "57:58", "it up Omid yeah if you go to our website", "58:01", "you'll see a map there that shows the", "58:04", "current known distribution of where the", "58:06", "disease is so the other

this", "66:22", "is Jeffery deer farms", "66:24", "I think deer farms have been around for", "66:27", "a long time there's a few Google you", "66:29", "know tame deer you'll find some from", "66:31",

exponentially yeah I used to work", "66:52", "for for Texas Parks and Wildlife before", "66:55", "I worked for USGS and one of the things", "66:59", "I did was I administered the the deer", "67:01",

years", "67:31", "later when I left Parks and Wildlife in", "67:34", "Texas there are around six or seven", "67:36", "hundred so it just grew", "67:38", "exponentially and now I believe they're",

"67:51", "Wisconsin's got a couple hundred so so", "67:55", "except they're part of the equation but", "67:57", "I don't want to you know I don't want to", "67:59", "place all the blame for CWD moving it", "68:02", "around because there's other", "68:03", "possibilities for how this disease moves", "68:05", "around Doug hit on a one of them and", "68:09", "that's the the idea of carcass movement",

you know the meat component in a", "68:32", "deer is probably around thirty thirty", "68:34", "five percent something like that so I've", "68:35", "got a lot of other stuff landfills it", "68:38",

rest", "68:58", "of the material and I drive to the dump", "69:00", "which is you know 25 miles away they say", "69:03", "no we're not taking that well now what", "69:06", "am I gonna do with this stuff so I could", "69:07", "double bag it you know a little bit at a", "69:09", "time put it out in the trash you know or", "69:12", "maybe on the way home I'm driving past a", "69:15", "state on a state park or a State Natural", "69:17", "Area or a wildlife management here and I", "69:19", "see a trail go down there and I drive", "69:20", "down that trail and hey there's a pile", "69:23", "of deer bones and deer heads here whoops", "69:27", "and I knocked that over sorry about that", "69:29", "Joe", "69:32", "so it's easy to see how inadvertently", "69:37", "just hold your thought when you're not", "69:39", "on a microphone just uh just that's and", "69:44", "it is one of the one of the concerns is", "69:46", "how are we you know how what kind of", "69:50", "do we have with the carcasses is", "69:52", "something that we're talking about a lot", "69:54", "more in Wisconsin now and it and it's", "69:56", "become an issue and one of the", "69:57", "interestingly I'm the county deer", "69:59", "Advisory Committee for Richland County", "70:01", "and we it's a citizen group and we have", "70:04", "some say in season structure and then", "70:09", "how many antlerless permits there are", "70:11", "there's a lot of things we don't have", "70:12", "any say in which is you know fine I'd", "70:14", "rather leave it to the biologists but", "70:16", "because there are hunters involved I'm", "70:19", "happy to be one of them one of the", "70:22", "things that happen in our in our spring", "70:24", "hearings is that we had folks come in", "70:25", "and say you know we're concerned about", "70:27", "chronic wasting disease and we don't to", "70:30", "spread it on the landscape but when we", "70:31", "put the bones out on the curb they", "70:34", "aren't taking it on the Wisconsin DNR", "70:37", "CWD website there's a list of haulers", "70:40", "who will take it so there are some that", "70:42", "will take it there are some who don't", "70:45", "my problem is were they taking it well", "70:47", "they're taking it to clay lined land", "70:51", "landfills and how it's being handled", "70:55", "there's you know there's some question", "70:57", "but it can be

so you know and we noted how", "71:07", "prions behind the various surfaces they", "71:09", "bind to clay particles very very tightly", "71:11", "and so one of the researchers at UW", "71:13", "Madison's name's Joel Patterson you know", "71:16", "tom was looking at this issue you know", "71:18", "10 years ago to try and figure out is", "71:20", "can it be safely done it turns out if", "71:22", "you put about 1/8 inch clay liner", "71:24", "underneath you know one portion of your", "71:27", "landfill you can put all the deer and", "71:29", "all the prions there that you want to", "71:31", "and while the prions will then migrate", "71:33", "down you know over time through the soil", "71:36", "when they come in contact with the play", "71:38", "clay particles they bind and they don't", "71:41", "go anywhere so it can be completely", "71:43", "safely done so there's there's a way to", "71:47", "dispose of these materials very very", "71:50", "safely but the the thought of it the", "71:54", "risk associated with it the liability", "71:57", "some some landfill owners are just like", "71:59", "yeah we'd rather not and interestingly", "72:02", "because", "72:03", "we were challenged about this what are", "72:05", "we supposed to do and can incinerate it", "72:07", "right because they'll well it ends up", "72:10", "being a budget issue in Wisconsin", "72:11", "everything's a budget issue and the DNR", "72:13", "is having you know issues of that and is", "72:16", "something I'd like to talk about a", "72:17", "little bit but and they weren't when", "72:21", "when this all first happened", "72:23", "seventeen years ago they were", "72:24", "incinerating during became a you know", "72:27", "problem but there are landfills that are", "72:33", "taking it and there are haulers who will", "72:34", "take it", "72:35", "they have dumpsters that they use", "72:36", "specifically for it they're lined with", "72:39", "you know heavy mill plastic they it's", "72:42", "they're very specific to deer bones but", "72:46", "some haulers aren't doing it so I I", "72:48", "contacted the head of a solid waste for", "72:50", "the state of Wisconsin", "72:51", "and asked well how is this I go on your", "72:54", "website and I see some taken some don't", "72:56", "and her response was we have no", "72:58", "legislative authority to require them to", "73:01", "take this so some are doing it", "73:04", "voluntarily and actually one solid waste", "73:07", "hauler said to me jeez were putting a", "73:10", "hell of a lot worse stuff in the", "73:12", "landfills then you know some deer bones", "73:15", "but it's you know it's simple hygiene so", "73:18", "one of the efforts that we're working on", "73:20", "in in southwest Wisconsin right now is", "73:23", "to and it's a funding issue is to put", "73:27", "place dumpsters in areas where you know", "73:32", "like I'm volunteering to have one on my", "73:34", "farm it's a question of who's gonna pay", "73:36", "for it and if it comes down to it I'm", "73:37", "gonna pay for the damn dumpster or about", "73:39", "500 bucks for a 20-yard dumpster but so", "73:42", "that then you know people come by throw", "73:44", "their put their bones in that dumpster", "73:46", "and then they'll be properly disposed of", "73:48", "because we have a hauler", "73:50", "near us who's said we're willing to", "73:52", "bring them there you know to bring the", "73:55", "dumpster there and then dispose of the", "73:57", "bones properly like they do with one of", "74:01", "the lockers that one of the butcher", "74:02", "shops that you know process is deer they", "74:04", "have the set up which is actually when I", "74:06", "saw it I was like well why aren't we", "74:08", "doing that in you know countywide in", "74:10", "various places so that people aren't", "74:12", "chucking them in the ditch", "74:14", "I mean otherwise you're holding on to", "74:16", "the damn bones until you find out", "74:17", "whether the things if you're if you're", "74:19", "being completely careful about the", "74:23", "hygiene which we I've been trying to do", "74:25", "I'm something you got a pile of bones in", "74:27", "the old milk house down there until you", "74:29", "find out whether it's positive or not", "74:31", "and I'm literally keeping it the deer", "74:33", "bones separate so that when I find out", "74:36", "that deer a was non positive well okay I", "74:40", "can put those out or something like that", "74:43", "so that's one of the things there's a", "74:45", "difference between what we can we can", "74:47", "there's natural spreading of the disease", "74:49", "and then there's human-like putting them", "74:52", "on trucks and and moving around or", "74:54", "taking the bones from this carcass thing", "74:56", "is it really a low-hanging fruit the", "74:58", "idea that we can't fix this one I mean", "75:01", "that's that's ridiculous and it's it's", "75:03", "it's it's easy it seems easy to me I", "75:06", "mean it's just a matter of will and", "75:09", "money and then an education obviously", "75:11", "that we're providing opportunity for", "75:14", "this um I've been working with the DNR a", "75:17", "little bit on and this weren't some", "75:18", "discussions about two things one is", "75:22", "self-service kiosks so to make getting", "75:25", "getting your deer tested easier where", "75:28", "you essentially cut the head off the", "75:29", "deer and leave it in a kiosk with some", "75:33", "information about where it was and you", "75:35", "know they're fairly simple they've been", "75:36", "doing this for a couple of years on an", "75:37", "experimental basis but again it becomes", "75:40", "a budget issue so we're hoping that", "75:43", "we're going to be able to do is start", "75:44", "something called adopt a kiosk", "75:46", "essentially that hunters and and people", "75:48", "are sportsmen groups will gather those", "75:53", "heads and then take them into the", "75:55", "testing facility and therefore you know", "75:57", "keep the budget money targeted at doing", "76:00", "the actual testing right next to that", "76:02", "that uh self-service kiosks really", "76:05", "should be a dumpster that you can throw", "76:10", "your deer bones into whether you know", "76:11", "whether it's positive or not otherwise", "76:13", "you are holding it the other thing that", "76:14", "the DNR suggests that we do is if you", "76:17", "kill the deer on your farm leave the", "76:19", "bones on your farm makes sense to me", "76:22", "that way if it is positive disease is", "76:25", "already there", "76:27", "and so you're not taking as great a", "76:29", "chance of moving in that's not an", "76:31", "optimal solution to leave that stuff on", "76:33", "on the ground surface an optimal", "76:36", "solution is dig a hole but you know it's", "76:38", "pretty hard to dig sometimes in December", "76:40", "in Wisconsin well if I if the dumpsters", "76:43", "thing doesn't end up working out with me", "76:45", "there will be a hole I mean last year we", "76:47", "I just kept the bone separate and the", "76:49", "and the ones that we actually took the", "76:52", "from the one deer it was they went into", "76:54", "the dumpster at the locker this all", "76:59", "seems to me sorry to interrupt but this", "77:00", "all seems to me like band-aids on", "77:02", "massive gunshot wounds it is but go back", "77:05", "to the what I was saying before", "77:07", "let's buy time right because this shit's", "77:10", "spreading man yeah

so we don't know if", "85:25", "they'll get there we got to put a fence", "85:26", "around Wisconsin dug giant 130 feet are", "85:30", "well it's you know there's 30 feet at", "85:32", "Northern

"85:46", "so lower 48 25 it's more than 50% then", "85:49", "more than 50% of states have it Wow", "85:53", "25:48 yep here so this is something that", "85:56", "it just can't be dismissed this is not", "85:59", "this is not something that's a hoax this", "86:01", "is not so the reason why people were", "86:03", "upset and would Ted said on the podcast", "86:05", "there's a very good reason well look if", "86:09", "I want to yeah I play guitar and if I", "86:11", "want to learn some kickass Detroit", "86:13", "guitar riffs I'm gonna listen to Ted", "86:15", "Nugent if I want to learn about CWD I'm", "86:18", "gonna listen Richards and guys like yeah", "86:19", "the thing is Ted does know a lot about", "86:21", "hunting a lot of wildlife you know it's", "86:24", "a lot about conservation but it appears", "86:26", "that he's very misinformed or under", "86:29", "informed let me let me let me try and", "86:32", "put this in perspective okay so you have", "86:35", "a disease which is contagious so always", "86:39", "fatal upon closed clinical presentation", "86:41", "they don't under percent fatal", "86:43", "yeah deer don't survive if humans don't", "86:45", "survive

be a horrible way to die okay", "86:57", "so that's a pretty significant set of", "87:00", "clinical signs or symptoms in an", "87:02", "individual animal right okay now let's", "87:04", "look at the geographic spread rampant", "87:07", "geographic spread so it has a", "87:09", "ever-expanding geographic footprint in", "87:12", "areas where it has been known the", "87:14", "longest we now have

Jamie to pull", "87:51", "up some photos of clinical CWD deer or", "87:56", "elk I think you had photos of the ones", "87:59", "that are there sick that so again 24", "88:03", "month plus or minus

positive and that one's", "88:21", "not CWD that's not the one before that", "88:24", "one what is that some of that was called", "88:27", "that's cutaneous fibromas there tumors", "88:30", "that grow on the surface of the skin", "88:32", "pretty grotesque looking because of that", "88:35", "um it's a virus it's if well if you get", "88:41", "those warts and those fibromas on your", "88:43", "eyes and they block your vision it would", "88:45", "be but otherwise it's about it's a", "88:47", "stressor on animals and you can actually", "88:48", "eat them they're fine but I don't think", "88:50", "I would that Jamie's got up there the", "88:54", "larger image scroll down that what is", "88:56", "that that's likely CWD yes absolutely", "88:59", "pick the one that's on the row", "89:01", "underneath the second one from the left", "89:04", "that one that the buck there the rib", "89:08", "that's yeah that's a photograph no you", "89:11", "know so that was taken by a game warden", "89:16", "Michael hopper is his name within the", "89:19", "state of Kansas and he's you know this", "89:23", "diseases has a pretty decent footprint", "89:25", "in Kansas that's game warden",

"89:39", "what's coming out of that", "89:40", "dears mouth see that stream of saliva", "89:43", "yeah yeah that's all filled with", "89:46", "infectious material so that's one of the", "89:48", "clinical signs is this hyper solid", "89:50", "that's a wild deer that's a wild deer so", "89:52", "it's almost like the this disease is", "89:55", "trying to spread itself it's um pretty", "89:58",

progressing progressive", "93:05", "dementia it's not at the point where we", "93:08", "are humanized which really are very very", "93:11", "poor we can't see disease yet but", "93:14", "disease is

that", "95:20", "potential tool and take it out of the", "95:22", "toolbox what about what about okay so a", "95:26", "wolf okay well coyote by us you know", "95:29", "they're eatin deer die in our woods you", "95:31", "know from we found a dead one last time", "95:34", "Steve was there and I was very", "95:35", "suspicious of it being a CWD because it", "95:38", "was a two and a half year old

that science has", "96:12", "been done and so it turns out if you", "96:15", "take CWD CWD positive material you put", "96:18", "it in the front", "96:18", "of a coyote it comes out the back end of",

would", "96:40", "be carrying it so that that coyote you", "96:43", "have to ask you so you could eat", "96:45", "CWD positive materials you could poop it", "96:48", "out so X number of hours later

well", "106:10", "I'm not going to shoot it doe because", "106:11", "you know rather and they're having two", "106:15", "fawns and this year at least in my area", "106:18", "we're seeing a lot of

there's a interesting here I talked", "107:40", "with folks in in the state of Michigan", "107:42", "and they've got a issue you know", "107:43", "relatively recent likely issue is CWD", "107:46",

already", "108:34", "CBD is beneficial in that if we have if", "108:39", "we have a herd of five hundred animals", "108:41", "with ten percent prevalence that's fifty", "108:44", "positives versus our

"109:34", "so from from a biological perspective", "109:37", "from a numerical modeling perspective of", "109:40", "disease I fail to see how this can work", "109:45", "so will it keep it hunters

don't know that they don't", "124:05", "know yeah that yeah yeah and that really", "124:09", "is one of the things so you know I", "124:11", "appreciate so much the opportunity to", "124:12", "come

many deer", "126:09", "get killed by winter you know it's way", "126:12", "more than CWD stop stop crying wolf yeah", "126:15", "it's a diversionary tactic you know just", "126:17", "the other thing that I'd like to bring", "126:18", "up about that um I've killed some big", "126:21", "deer and I get it guys want it", "126:27", "people want it hunters want to do that", "126:28", "sure I want to kill it's what they look", "126:30", "forward to they look forward to hunting", "126:31", "season it's only one time a year yeah", "126:33", "and you get to do that as we're not just", "126:36",

celebrated that dear", "126:56", "I enjoyed that dear I remember that", "126:58", "moment just as much as the 200-inch buck", "127:01", "that I killed it's it's different but it", "127:07", "concerns me that at times we get so", "127:12", "wrapped up and I was one of them man I", "127:14", "feel like a recovered alcoholic", "127:15", "sometimes about the whole healer thing", "127:17", "you know like I am Doug and I used to be", "127:19", "an 12-step process well and there you", "127:22", "know there is a part of that yeah but", "127:24", "that remember what the joy of hunting is", "127:27",

"127:42", "sounded huge alarms about this and you", "127:44", "know you talked about a little bit that", "127:45", "twenty years from now what you could you", "127:47", "know can be well it might take a", "127:48", "generation or two but it really could", "127:50", "become that I want to be able to eat the", "127:53", "meat and I want to know that in future", "127:55", "generations you know 100

know I", "131:19", "mean we look at the long-term impacts of", "131:21", "disease I talked a little bit about", "131:23", "population impacts driving populations", "131:25", "down the other thing we
