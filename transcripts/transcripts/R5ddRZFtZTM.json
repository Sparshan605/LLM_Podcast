"knife or a broken bottle whatever else I", "13:00", "mean that's one of the big things that", "13:02", "happens in places that have stricter gun", "13:03", "control and the argument would be that", "13:05", "hey you know that's safer for the people", "13:08", "it's easier to handle there's you know", "13:10", "more things that you can do some guy", "13:12", "with a machine gun gunning down all", "13:14", "these people but again gun control is", "13:17", "not really going to help this this guy", "13:19", "was", "13:19", "using illegal guns I mean the issue at", "13:22", "this point", "13:23", "is that there's so many guns out there", "13:25", "like even if you made guns illegal what", "13:28", "are we gonna sweep are we gonna go house", "13:30", "to house and if we do sweep and go house", "13:33", "to house man", "13:34", "people are gonna resist that because for", "13:36", "every one of these Psychopaths that", "13:39", "winds up shooting people and and and", "13:41", "gunning someone

government comes along and says well", "13:51", "now it's illegal for you to possess that", "13:53", "gun well then who has guns well we're", "13:56", "already criminals see I think the", "13:57", "solution is in-between and I think this", "13:59", "is another one where we get you know", "14:02", "this is a problem we have and I can't", "14:04", "even say when it started when you have", "14:06", "the two sides and it's either/or so it's", "14:08", "either you know no gun regulations or", "14:12", "far too many gun regulations and I think", "14:14", "the solution somewhere in between in my", "14:17", "opinion it's always been like why can't", "14:19", "we treat them like cars like when you", "14:21", "buy a car you register the car right so", "14:24", "the government knows like Joe knows Joe", "14:26", "has this car right and then when you you", "14:28", "have to have insurance in case something", "14:30", "goes wrong with the car and you hurt", "14:32", "somebody and then if you sell the car to", "14:34", "me you tell the government hey I just", "14:37", "sold the car to Alonso I'm no longer", "14:39", "liable for this car Alonso is liable for", "14:42", "this car right now though I've always", "14:43", "thought that would be the level of", "14:45", "common-sense gun registration well", "14:49", "here's another one that goes along with", "14:50", "that with guns you don't really have to", "14:51", "know how to use them this is where", "14:54", "unfortunately if you drive a car you", "14:56", "have to take tests you have to pass you", "14:58", "have to understand the registration the", "15:00", "the rules rather I mean you have to you", "15:03", "have to go and that guy has a sit next", "15:04", "to you we have to go through a driver's", "15:06", "test and I don't see why we can't do", "15:08", "that with guns usually absence where you", "15:10", "go to a range and show you know like the", "15:13", "safety of using a gun and and how to", "15:16", "shoot it yeah you know I don't I don't", "15:17", "see why we can't do that and even if", "15:19", "your family teaches you right they say", "15:21", "like in a lot of places you grow up with", "15:23", "guns and it's a kid your dad teaches you", "15:25", "well if your dad teaches you to drive", "15:27", "you still have to go to DMV and take the", "15:30", "test so it's like your dad your mom", "15:32", "ever your uncle could teach you to shoot", "15:34", "but you still there should be some some", "15:38", "level of testing to to get an idea", "15:40", "because we have you know just a couple", "15:42", "of weeks ago where you have a four year", "15:44", "old in Florida who was looking in their", "15:47", "grandmother's purse for candy and shot", "15:50", "themselves and it's like that grandma", "15:52", "there's a safety issue with the gun like", "15:55", "you don't tell the kid that go get some", "15:57", "candy when you know you have a gun I", "15:59", "think there's a nutty number like 21", "16:01", "people a year are killed in this country", "16:03", "by armed toddlers yeah yeah I believe it", "16:06", "I believe it find out what the numbers", "16:08", "I think it's 21 people are shot to death", "16:10", "by babies yeah and the other thing is", "16:13", "and you brought it up like how okay if", "16:15", "we didn't have guns then they'd be", "16:16", "killing you know with knives or clubs or", "16:19", "something like just that idea that that", "16:21", "we have to have that discussion like", "16:23", "well what weapon are the mass killers", "16:25", "going to use that in itself is insane", "16:27", "just just the fact that we're like yeah", "16:30", "we're gonna have these mass killers we", "16:31", "got to have them working with different", "16:33", "weapons I don't know on a mental health", "16:37", "I'm not even gonna pretend to have the", "16:39", "expertise to talk about what it is but", "16:42", "it's an issue that we don't spend money", "16:43", "on it's an issue not covered by a lot of", "16:47", "insurance a lot of insurance doesn't", "16:49", "cover any kind of mental health care", "16:51", "well here's the thing even if it does", "16:54", "cover I mean a giant percentage of the", "16:57", "people that commit these giant mass", "16:58", "shootings are either on psychoactive", "17:01", "medication or are having
