who said", "05:50", "sort of the wrong thing in the", "05:52", "transgender space she said something", "05:53", "like men are not women right and she got", "05:55", "banned and a life or to know it I think", "05:58", "it was temporary but you know sorry I", "06:00", "raised it and you know he obviously", "06:03", "can't know exactly what happened in that", "06:07", "case or at least it would be surprising", "06:08", "to me if he knew so the fact that he", "06:11", "doesn't have his finger on each one of", "06:13", "these cases and what the what the", "06:15", "rationale was and he has this sort of", "06:17", "generic answer that what you're seeing", "06:19", "you know in public is not necessarily", "06:22", "what we're seeing in fact in virtually", "06:25", "every actionable case is not what we're", "06:26", "seeing in private with respect to how", "06:28", "these people are opening opening", "06:30", "multiple accounts and doing seemingly", "06:33", "nefarious stuff behind the scenes now", "06:35", "whether that is true I don't know but I", "06:38", "mean I can just say that", "06:40", "Jack seemed one I liked him and he", "06:43", "seemed unusually open to talking about", "06:46", "anything I wanted to talk about it sighs", "06:47", "I saw one allegation that got ahold of", "06:49", "you was that you know you must have been", "06:51", "constrained by you know the topics you", "06:53", "couldn't touch in advance you must have", "06:55", "had some agreement with him in advance", "06:57", "you know it didn't happen with me right", "06:59", "now I should address that there was no", "07:00", "no discussion whatsoever about what was", "07:02", "off-limits yeah no nothing and he asked", "07:05", "for note so in my case I tell all my", "07:07", "guests and this is the difference", "07:09", "between you streaming live and and me", "07:11", "not I tell um I guess listen if at any", "07:14", "point in this interview you put your", "07:15", "foot in your mouth or I put my foot in", "07:17", "there we can edit it right like we I", "07:19", "want you I want you to be totally happy", "07:21", "with what you say over the next two or", "07:23", "three hours mm so if you have to take", "07:27", "something again take it again and you", "07:29", "know we'll just hide the seams as we go", "07:30", "now that virtually never happens right", "07:33", "and in Jack's case it there wasn't even", "07:35", "a wrinkle like that so but you know I", "07:38", "just you know I I recognize it's a", "07:40", "high-wire act for a lot of these people", "07:42", "especially for someone's running to", "07:43", "publicly traded companies right and you", "07:47", "know I also want to invited him on I", "07:48", "said I said Jack you know yeah we were", "07:50", "DM and on Twitter I said listen I", "07:52", "promise I'm not gonna make you smoke a", "07:53", "blunt on video and that got him so I", "07:56", "don't know how you got him but I didn't", "07:58", "try to get him just looking but I didn't", "08:00", "even think about it yeah we weren't", "08:02", "drinking we were just talked maybe we'd", "08:03", "been better if we were drinking because", "08:05", "it did seem very stiff I listened to it", "08:07", "after the fact and I mean I get from", "08:11", "their anticipation why it would be", "08:14", "disappointing I just thought it was kind", "08:16", "of boring I thought my podcast with them", "08:18", "just wasn't very good I sometimes do too", "08:22", "many podcasts and when I sometimes do", "08:24", "too many podcasts I think I run low on", "08:26", "juice and I'm not as I don't know I'm", "08:29", "not as engaged or I'm not as fired up", "08:32", "about it and maybe I just should have", "08:34", "definitely should have prepared more for", "08:36", "him but I really thought it was just", "08:38", "going to be a conversation about what", "08:40", "it's like and I thought that would be", "08:41", "really easy to do yeah because it's such", "08:43", "a unique position to be running", "08:45", "something like Twitter but he you know I", "08:47", "don't know if he was evasive and because", "08:49", "he didn't know the things or because he", "08:51", "didn't want to talk about", "08:53", "things but there was things like he", "08:54", "didn't know exactly why Alex Jones was", "08:57", "ultimately banned he didn't he couldn't", "09:00", "recall or didn't know no is that because", "09:02", "he couldn't recall is because he didn't", "09:03", "want to talk about it or is it because", "09:04", "he didn't remember it I mean I don't", "09:07", "know I mean you'd have to you have to be", "09:09", "inside his head to get that answer yeah", "09:11", "I mean he's clearly got a a very", "09:15", "practice line that he uses to answer", "09:18", "these questions and because I you know I", "09:20", "know what it's like to have boilerplate", "09:21", "now you know I've been a book on a book", "09:22", "tour and you're just basically getting", "09:24", "asked the same questions again and again", "09:25", "and here he's getting asked fairly", "09:29", "pointed questions about you know where", "09:32", "Twitter's going and he's got you know I", "09:34", "don't think this is dishonest I just", "09:36", "think but it has this amazing ability to", "09:39", "close the door to further inquiry", "09:43", "because he gives you the full maiya", "09:45", "culpa right up front you ask like what's", "09:47", "what's the situation with you know the", "09:49", "seemingly asymmetrical banding of people", "09:51", "and he'll say you know yeah we really I", "09:54", "mean we got to get much better at", "09:55", "communicating our process we're not", "09:57", "nearly transparent enough this whole", "09:59", "thing is in disarray and my job is to", "10:01", "fix it right so it's like a global you", "10:03", "know we're fucked up and we're gonna get", "10:05", "better I promise you right yeah and", "10:07", "there's do any good for the people that", "10:09", "already band but there's not a lot to", "10:11", "get right on that right in an interview", "10:13", "yes so it's it worked whether you know I", "10:16", "don't think it's nefarious I think it", "10:17", "could well be totally honest but it does", "10:21", "have this this effect of you just keep", "10:24", "reaching a certain kind of brick wall", "10:26", "that you know was gonna be there you", "10:27", "know yeah that's I felt that too and I", "10:30", "didn't didn't really get that very well", "10:33", "and that was a big part of the blowback", "10:35", "but then the blowback was accentuated", "10:37", "when they found out that he sponsors me", "10:38", "as the catch app is one of his", "10:41", "businesses and it sponsors the podcast", "10:44", "yeah yeah well I had a very similar", "10:46", "result and I don't have that that", "10:48", "problem so as you know that I don't", "10:49", "think that diagnoses your situation at", "10:51", "all but it's very interesting the", "10:53", "difference between these business the", "10:56", "business models under which we run our", "10:57", "podcasts and just the different I mean", "11:01", "just every choice you make and how to", "11:03", "produce a podcast I essentially have", "11:05", "made the opposite one you", "11:06", "like streaming live like this mm-hmm the", "11:09", "fact that you're so that this is just", "11:11", "all very interesting to make so I'm kind", "11:13", "of a reluctant student of digital media", "11:16", "now because I've just kind of stumbled", "11:18", "into this Wild West that you know you", "11:20", "and large part have invented right I", "11:21", "mean this podcast in space was nothing", "11:23", "and now we've got Spotify you know", "11:25", "buying up and it's like a land grab for", "11:27", "audio yeah that we were talking about", "11:29", "that before the podcast they just", "11:30", "purchased some company was it given what", "11:33", "is it called yeah for some ungodly", "11:36", "amount of money yeah like two hundred", "11:38", "million dollars not gonna spend five", "11:40", "hundred this year or something and so", "11:42", "it's it's this we're all just making", "11:44", "this up and you know I'm making and you", "11:47", "know I've just released a meditation app", "11:48", "which is a different business model", "11:51", "still and so now I have these kind of", "11:52", "two parallel digital businesses", "11:54", "happening in my life and it's um it's", "11:58", "just very interesting the decisions you", "12:00", "make or a force to make and the", "12:01", "consequences of it and so like the fact", "12:03", "that we're having this conversation live", "12:04", "you don't even have to think about", "12:06", "whether you're gonna edit this right", "12:07", "because it's like it's streaming live", "12:09", "and you know we're gonna when we're done", "12:10", "we're gonna turn off the mics and walk", "12:12", "out of here and your job is done with my", "12:15", "podcast that's not the workflow at all", "12:17", "and I saw I I totally envy this this", "12:21", "approach that you have but for a variety", "12:23", "of reasons I feel like I can't take it", "12:24", "in in my life and so it's means but it", "12:28", "is very different it dictates many", "12:30", "choices you know down the line which I", "12:35", "mean there's there's a positive and", "12:37", "negative but it's you know the positive", "12:38", "is what you hear is what we got and", "12:41", "we're done after we turn these mics off", "12:44", "and that's and that's not you know", "12:45", "that's not how I podcast there's also", "12:47", "the visual element of it and the visual", "12:49", "element of it and initially was almost", "12:51", "like a side effect I mean we we first", "12:53", "started it out visually but then when it", "12:55", "started going to iTunes the iTunes", "12:57", "aspect of it became the focus the audio", "13:00", "version of it rather became the focus", "13:02", "but then we decided to stream on YouTube", "13:05", "and put it up on YouTube and but it was", "13:07", "totally not profitable it was just for", "13:09", "for a goof like oh we'll have the video", "13:11", "up why not", "13:12", "some people like video it was one of", "13:14", "those things but then you realize", "13:15", "ultimately that YouTube becomes a viable", "13:17", "source of revenue and then it's also the", "13:20", "a lot of people like to watch it you", "13:23", "know and they also like to watch because", "13:24", "they can comment under it that was the", "13:26", "other thing that came out of the jak", "13:27", "podcast we got into a controversy about", "13:30", "comments and about how comments are", "13:33", "deleted or how they're shown in hidden", "13:36", "and what happens because people were", "13:38", "accusing Jamie of deleting all the", "13:40", "derogatory comments that we don't touch", "13:43", "any we don't we don't delete any of them", "13:45", "we don't do anything to them we just", "13:47", "leave them up there and it's a mostly a", "13:49", "cesspool but I mean even even on a good", "13:52", "podcast there's a lot of crazy shit that", "13:54", "happens on these things but from what we", "13:56", "think and Jamie correct me if I'm wrong", "13:58", "you think that what's going on is that", "14:00", "people are marking other people's posts", "14:02", "as spam yeah there's that and then", "14:05", "Brandon also has the theory that a lot", "14:07", "of alt-right people are targeted by the", "14:10", "algorithm that YouTube uses like in in", "14:12", "in one case there was a guy who had a", "14:14", "Pepe the Frog avatar and he said like", "14:17", "his his comment immediately went to spam", "14:19", "and that the other thing is that the", "14:22", "comments are curated depending upon who", "14:25", "is watching it and what account it'll be", "14:27", "they'll be different sort of yeah", "14:30", "they'll propagate different comments to", "14:31", "the top it's not a this you can actually", "14:34", "change it if you if you prefer to see", "14:36", "the most new comment like your own", "14:38", "personal YouTube when you're watching", "14:40", "you you as a viewer yes or user of", "14:42", "YouTube have to make that actual yeah so", "14:45", "that exact conspiracy theory just", "14:47", "heightened the whole thing right okay", "14:48", "now they're deleting negative comments", "14:50", "like look I don't like doing bad podcast", "14:52", "but I will be the first one to tell you", "14:54", "when I think a podcast sucked yeah that", "14:57", "podcast was definitely disappointing it", "14:58", "wasn't good", "14:59", "mine wasn't good it was like I said when", "15:01", "I listened to it was like god this is", "15:02", "kind of boring yeah this wasn't it", "15:04", "wasn't juicy", "15:05", "there was nothing he we didn't get a", "15:07", "flow it wasn't like he and I were just", "15:09", "shooting the shit having a good time", "15:11", "well to take that one decision so you", "15:13", "have decided to make video a main", "15:15", "component of this podcast so it's still", "15:17", "probably a small percentage of your", "15:19", "actual listens not anymore", "15:21", "not anymore it's it's gotten to it's", "15:23", "almost 50/50 awesome cuz it's closing in", "15:25", "on that it used to be like ninety ten", "15:27", "yeah yeah okay so you so I have it I", "15:30", "don't have a video component and so I", "15:31", "just put audio on YouTube but I put", "15:33", "absolute", "15:34", "no energy into YouTube I mean that may", "15:36", "one day change but because I don't I", "15:39", "don't care what's happening on YouTube", "15:40", "right so I never see the comments and", "15:42", "whenever I look it is as you say a", "15:44", "cesspool it's insane I mean YouTube's", "15:46", "it's just skews massively right", "15:48", "it's skews just massively male and it's", "15:54", "probably skews very young too so you", "15:56", "have it just solely just like millennial", "15:58", "alt-right craziness right it's like like", "16:00", "as I say these sentences your YouTube", "16:02", "page is just blowing up with hate for me", "16:03", "you got a bunch of you know Millennials", "16:06", "thumbs up their asses just whinging", "16:08", "right yeah yeah older people too well", "16:10", "yeah but I mean it's gotta be younger", "16:12", "than most of where well first of all I'm", "16:14", "not even seen most comment threads they", "16:17", "could possibly respond to anything I put", "16:19", "out there now right so I got out I don't", "16:20", "even look at

not", "26:16", "gonna pay for this I'm gonna find this", "26:17", "information somewhere else so I we've", "26:19", "all been anchored to this thing and you", "26:22", "know something is gonna win in the end I", "26:25", "mean I you know I think at some point", "26:26", "you know it's gonna look much more like", "26:30", "Netflix or much more like Facebook and I", "26:33", "mean I'm throwing my

this equipment but", "26:49", "other than that it's just and bandwidth", "26:51", "and rent and all that stuff other than", "26:53", "that just goes up right whereas you do a", "26:54", "comedy

mean you have so", "27:27", "much special effects and so to ask for", "27:30", "that for free seems B to me seems", "27:33", "ridiculous well yeah yeah but but except", "27:36", "the I mean so I'm kind of splitting", "27:38", "again I'm running on two tracks here an", "27:39", "app is much more like a television show", "27:42", "surprisingly than it is like a podcast", "27:44", "but yes but even if it's just a podcast", "27:47", "if you want to build something if you", "27:49", "want to build a media company like", "27:51", "either like like let's say you were", "27:52", "let's say you were asking for support", "27:54", "for this otherwise free podcast people", "27:58", "don't know what your aspirations are I", "28:00", "mean maybe you want to start a podcast", "28:01", "network right maybe you had you're", "28:03", "trying to build a business that is that", "28:05", "maybe you have massive payroll expenses", "28:08", "that you know so the expectation that", "28:11", "the product should always be free closes", "28:14", "the door to any of those aspirations if", "28:17", "in fact you have them and you know it's", "28:20", "like I mean it's very interesting", "28:22",

"a more transactional space that they", "28:35", "were just let's say buying my next book", "28:37", "right so like for me offering a free", "28:41", "podcast and then saying if you find this", "28:44", "valuable you can support it right that", "28:46", "for you know from the side of being a", "28:48", "creator of that content", "28:50", "it feels like the the most transparent", "28:53", "interaction possible because a person", "28:55", "can listen for free for as long as they", "28:57", "want to just discover how valuable this", "28:59", "and then they can support it to the",

it's", "29:16", "transactional with but with a podcast", "29:20", "people make calculations that they would", "29:24", "never make when they're just figuring", "29:26", "out whether they want to buy something", "29:27", "like like I'll and it's really a long", "29:29", "line to what you just described people", "29:31", "say well how much does a podcast cost to", "29:34", "produce right like if I knew what you", "29:36", "were spending the money on and what it", "29:38", "costs you to do this podcast well then I", "29:41", "would support you right but they're", "29:42", "never saying how much does it cost to", "29:45", "write a book and if I knew what you were", "29:47", "gonna spend the money on once you once", "29:49", "you were once once I bought this book", "29:51", "then I would know whether or not I", "29:53", "wanted to buy it you then want the book", "29:54", "or you don't right so the problem with", "29:56", "the support model and this the part the", "29:58", "problem with patreon and everything else", "30:00", "is that it engages this sort of the", "30:02", "philanthropy charity side of the brain", "30:04", "right and people are worried about what", "30:07", "you're gonna do and how much it all", "30:08", "cause like how much does its might cost", "30:10", "right yeah like that that's that's a", "30:12", "question that someone is asking when", "30:13", "they're donating it wasn't in donating", "30:15", "and the problem there is they're not", "30:18", "understanding you know just the", "30:21", "opportunity cost like I you know I have", "30:22", "to decide how to spend my time am I", "30:24", "gonna spend 90% of my time on a podcast", "30:26", "well that if so that closes the door to", "30:30", "virtually everything else I can do right", "30:33", "so it's you know it has to become a", "30:34", "viable business and so I mean I I've", "30:37", "recognized now that I'm you know to some", "30:41", "degree going against the grain of human", "30:42",

"30:51", "still like and remind them of it but I'm", "30:53", "personally I'm gonna go more and more", "30:55", "than in the direction of putting stuff", "30:57", "behind a paywall", "30:58", "and if people want it then they can", "31:01", "support and so it's it's a it's", "31:03", "kind of sort of Netflix the ultimate", "31:05", "version of it would be if it were", "31:08", "Netflix that would also let you get it", "31:10", "for free if you really couldn't afford", "31:11", "it right that I mean that that that's", "31:14", "the guilt for a business model that I'm", "31:16", "converging on

whiskey", "43:04", "we both had two or three glasses of", "43:06", "whiskey right before the weed came out", "43:08", "nobody cared the fact that the CEO of", "43:10", "Tesla was drunk right like no

mean the the problem", "43:28", "for me there with that podcast frankly", "43:30", "was that I feel like you both got", "43:32", "unlucky with Walsh is where he was in", "43:35", "his life at that moment and because so", "43:38", "what that podcast showcased at least for", "43:41", "the first I don't know 90 minutes was", "43:44", "just how many user interface problems", "43:47", "you could

"44:05", "once we got loose yeah that was good but", "44:07", "it was still it's like you know he was", "44:08", "just in a space that he was so massively", "44:12", "stressed and so overworked and just I", "44:15", "mean he had you know fires everywhere", "44:18", "that had to be put out and", "44:21", "so I just thought you know as a friend I", "44:22", "just felt like okay this is sort of the", "44:24", "wrong time to be doing this and this is", "44:26", "it you know and and so I just felt you", "44:28", "know it just felt unlucky to me so", "44:30", "because he's again I you know I see him", "44:35", "in in many other moments and he can be", "44:39", "okay that was out there was actually a", "44:41", "circumstance where I was looking at the", "44:42", "comments right you know and and I was", "44:43", "saying okay these these are people who", "44:46", "are basically reading him as somebody", "44:47", "who is is much stranger than in fact he", "44:50", "he ever is and I could see why they were", "44:54", "doing that because he the guy he just", "44:55", "seemed in a very stressed space in his", "44:57", "life well it was interesting he was very", "44:59", "different when he first got here versus", "45:01", "when the mic came on right when he first", "45:03", "got here he pulls out the fucking", "45:05", "blowtorch and starts shooting this", "45:08", "flamethrower in the middle of the", "45:09", "hallway and we're laughing and I'm like", "45:11", "he's gonna be easy this is great right", "45:13", "and then we sat down and then stiff yeah", "45:16", "right off

arguing that you shouldn't be live", "45:28", "because it it has a massive advantage", "45:30", "for you as well but it is there's just a", "45:34", "different feeling yeah like you know if", "45:35", "I knew that this was being taped and I", "45:38", "could rethink the thing we're about to", "45:39", "say about Liam Neeson or whatever it is", "45:41", "yeah you know it's it's different yeah", "45:44", "and so but well the Liam Neeson story is", "45:47", "a perfect go there yeah let's go there a", "45:50", "perfect example of a story where you", "45:53", "know if you were Liam's friend you
