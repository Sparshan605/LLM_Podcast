"15:12", "alien", "15:12", "but he was really clear that he only saw", "15:14", "it for literally a second as he was", "15:16", "walking by", "15:17", "saw something and again you know how the", "15:20", "brain works in memory you could", "15:22", "you can really plant false memories", "15:24", "everybody wants to pretend their memory", "15:25", "is so good", "15:26", "memories are terrible well bob admitted", "15:28", "from the beginning", "15:29", "remember with the first interview we did", "15:31", "i think it was june of 89 so it was a", "15:33", "little after we did that live interview", "15:35", "but months before we went with his id", "15:39", "and that was really we recorded it in", "15:40", "case something happened to him he was", "15:42", "afraid he was going to be killed", "15:43", "there were a lot of really weird things", "15:45", "going on and and i was worried about it", "15:47", "too i wanted to get it on the record in", "15:49", "case suddenly he disappeared so we", "15:51", "recorded this long interview and", "15:52", "and always he downplays stuff like that", "15:55", "that's an example", "15:56", "yeah i might just i saw something that", "15:58", "was that size", "15:59", "i don't believe it was an alien it was", "16:00", "just a glimpse maybe they're messing", "16:02", "with my head", "16:02", "he also admits that they did mess with", "16:05", "his head", "16:06", "that he had to uh they underwent some", "16:08", "kind of uh hypnosis that they made him", "16:10", "drink this weird green", "16:11", "liquid probably lsd well maybe", "16:14", "um they said it was an allergy test but", "16:16", "yeah i mean but you know", "16:18", "to your point just real quick is uh", "16:20", "after 30 years it's not that he", "16:22", "changed his story he's changed so when i", "16:24", "was interviewing him you know he cracked", "16:26", "the book back open with me", "16:28", "it was like he was saying the science", "16:30", "and technology is what i know i had my", "16:32", "hands on that i can't attest to what i", "16:34", "read in the documents", "16:35", "yeah i saw something for a brief", "16:37", "millisecond through a fucking window", "16:39", "but i don't know what that was so so", "16:40", "people have taken what he said and", "16:42", "exaggerated it bob has always been", "16:44", "skeptical", "16:45", "of the things he didn't have his hands", "16:46", "on and i admire that and he's changed as", "16:49", "a human as a human he's matured", "16:51", "so now he's saying okay let me look at", "16:53", "it rationally i don't know what i saw", "16:55", "through that window right", "16:56", "i appreciate that he's so straight yeah", "16:58", "he's very straight", "16:59", "you know they various scenarios have", "17:02", "popped up over the years about why he", "17:04", "came forward there are people who", "17:05", "believe he just made it up he was trying", "17:06", "to make money or he wanted attention", "17:08", "there are people who believe it's", "17:09", "government disinformation to distract", "17:11", "attention", "17:12", "from something else that was going on", "17:14", "out there or they believe both of them", "17:16", "which you know they would seem to be", "17:17", "mutually exclusive bob would admit that", "17:20", "he had no business being there", "17:22", "that they maybe that there were much", "17:23", "more qualified people to work on those", "17:25", "kind of things", "17:26", "maybe he was a guy who thinks outside", "17:28", "the box who might give a new slant on", "17:30", "trying to figure this stuff out that", "17:31", "they had had for", "17:32", "decades and had not had not uh been able", "17:35", "to duplicate we should explain that a", "17:36", "little bit the los alamos lab story was", "17:39", "him", "17:39", "he put a jet engine on a honda right and", "17:42", "it's", "17:42", "it was a functional jet car that he", "17:45", "built himself", "17:46", "so he was a legitimate propulsion expert", "17:49", "and again like a super science nerd", "17:51", "like where he got his education is", "17:53", "what's weird right i", "17:54", "finally got an interview with the guy", "17:56", "that wrote that article two weeks ago", "17:58", "so the guy uh terry english right", "18:01", "finally after all this time he called me", "18:03", "back three years late you know what i", "18:04", "mean", "18:04", "put him in the movie and i said look", "18:07", "here's the point you said bob lazar was", "18:09", "a", "18:09", "physicist at los alamos so how did you", "18:12", "base that you're writing a paper and he", "18:13", "goes yeah and it got picked up by ap", "18:15", "news", "18:16", "he goes if i had misrepresented that he", "18:18", "was a physicist at los alamos", "18:20", "i would have been blackballed by", "18:22", "everybody at los alamos they take that", "18:24", "very seriously", "18:25", "he was a physicist i reported it ap news", "18:27", "picked it up they repeated it", "18:29", "not word one from anybody saying he", "18:31", "wasn't a physicist at los alamos", "18:33", "it's little things like that that you", "18:34", "know nothing bob has ever said", "18:37", "have i found out yeah this is a real hot", "18:40", "rod", "18:40", "and he did the story because the car was", "18:42", "badass when he fired it up", "18:44", "when he has a history of this he also", "18:46", "made a hydrogen-powered corvette", "18:48", "later on uh yeah he's uh he's a wizard", "18:50", "he's a very smart guy", "18:52", "you know he he will admit to you that", "18:54", "maybe he was picked for the job", "18:56", "they figured all right in case he blabs", "18:59", "we can discredit this guy like that when", "19:01", "we're done with him", "19:02", "there's things in his background he", "19:04", "likes it to blow things up he likes", "19:06", "explosives he", "19:07", "had a pirate flag on his on his house at", "19:09", "the time that i first met him", "19:11", "uh he he liked machine guns he you know", "19:13", "he had an illegal fireworks show that", "19:15", "would", "19:15", "go out in the desert every year that", "19:17", "became a a world-class event", "19:19", "he uh got into some legal trouble after", "19:22", "he'd worked out there so there's a lot", "19:23", "of things in his life they could use to",

over the world", "19:41", "and i'm sorry but the bob lazar version", "19:43", "of of that sto the tale", "19:45", "is the one that prevailed it's known", "19:47", "everywhere it's been in movies and books", "19:49", "and tv shows it", "19:50", "it's launched a thousand different uh", "19:52", "you know project", "19:54", "products like the the hat yeah las vegas", "19:56", "51s our", "19:58",

"20:49", "yeah and that story that he told when he", "20:52", "was on the podcast here", "20:54", "got phenomenal response there were so", "20:57", "many people that i talked to that were", "20:58", "my friends who were skeptical about that", "21:00", "shit", "21:01", "they they call me up and go hey man i'm", "21:03", "i'm starting to believe this is real", "21:05", "and i'm like you should watch the", "21:06", "documentary and then you should watch", "21:08", "the commander fravor", "21:09", "interview where he talks about the tick", "21:11", "tock uh the tic tac ufo", "21:13", "that they encountered off of san diego", "21:15", "because you're talking about a", "21:17", "rock-solid military man with no", "21:19", "shenanigans in his background", "21:21", "who is telling a story about a craft", "21:24", "that they cannot explain", "21:25", "doing things that defy physics in our", "21:28", "understanding of propulsion systems", "21:30", "and quite a few people from that", "21:33", "interview have completely changed their", "21:35", "tune friends of mine who thought it was", "21:36", "total horseshit have done a 180 and", "21:38", "they're like fuck is this real", "21:40", "then the new york times story came out", "21:42", "of course and the new york times is", "21:43", "showing", "21:44", "all these images of these ufos and these", "21:48", "these things that they can't explain", "21:49", "that all exhibit very similar", "21:52", "propulsion methods or at least", "21:56", "speeds that they can't explain they move", "21:59", "the same way", "22:00", "and there's legitimate people legitimate", "22:02", "scientists now", "22:03", "that are starting to take this into", "22:05", "consideration and say okay", "22:07", "if this is from earth then there's got", "22:10", "to be some sort of a program", "22:12", "that has technology that's far beyond", "22:14", "anything we knew was possible", "22:16", "how did they do that is it because", "22:17", "there's some super geniuses that the", "22:19", "government gets a hold of right when", "22:21", "they're in college and they immediately", "22:23", "ship them off to the desert and have", "22:24", "them create this stuff", "22:25", "or are we in fact encountering something", "22:28", "like us from the future or something", "22:31", "from another place", "22:32", "that has had a completely different path", "22:34", "to technology", "22:35", "but it's not outside the realm of", "22:37", "possibility we're here", "22:39", "we're here sending videos through our", "22:41", "phones to each other", "22:42", "you know we're talking to people that", "22:44", "you know it's being relayed but", "22:46", "through the sky we're watching films", "22:50", "that are instantly downloaded wirelessly", "22:54", "from these servers i mean with the just", "22:56", "the technology that we have right now", "22:58", "is completely alien to anybody who was", "23:00", "around in roswell in 1947", "23:03", "from 1947 to 2020 in terms of the", "23:07", "universe is", "23:08", "not even a half of a blink of an eye and", "23:10", "then boom things have changed so", "23:12", "radically it's not", "23:13", "it's not crazy to think that something", "23:16", "from", "23:17", "somewhere is far ahead of us yes so", "23:20", "that's one of the big things", "23:21", "getting commander fravor in that room", "23:23", "with bob was so cool because people", "23:24", "bob talks to whoever he's talking with", "23:26", "he helps you understand what he's saying", "23:29", "he can go into high specified detail on", "23:31", "stuff but typically he's just talking to", "23:32", "whoever's there", "23:33", "when when i got him in front of", "23:35", "commander fraver all of us and matt we", "23:36", "were all in the room", "23:37", "it was amazing because commander fraber", "23:40", "saw it too he saw something like bob saw", "23:42", "it", "23:43", "and the way that the craft the tic tac", "23:45", "moved it it cannot", "23:47", "be something that we have because it was", "23:50", "clearly", "23:51", "gravitationally propelled this is", "23:52", "something they talk about commander", "23:53", "framers saw it", "23:54", "bouncing like a ping-pong ball on the", "23:57", "inside of a glass", "23:58", "the the inertia being able to go and the", "24:00", "coolest thing bob said was", "24:02", "well command favored dave it could have", "24:05", "been a", "24:06", "a subject to a time distortion so you're", "24:09", "seeing it one way and they started", "24:10", "talking about gravity amplification", "24:12", "it was just so cool to see them talk", "24:14", "without an audience", "24:16", "what the fuck did commander fraber see", "24:18", "and bob was it's cool that when he", "24:20", "can be calm and chill like that and just", "24:22", "talk to another human", "24:23", "and what's crazy is what commander", "24:25", "fravor is describing", "24:27", "is what bob was describing the", "24:28", "propulsion systems of 1989", "24:30", "they were working on straight up it's", "24:32", "the exact same thing even the way it", "24:34", "turns sideways", "24:35", "to move to move off well that's exactly", "24:37", "how he was describing it", "24:39", "yeah that's which is crazy you know we", "24:41", "have this video and everybody says", "24:42", "oh it's this it's that it's another", "24:44", "plane an fa18 dude", "24:46", "i've talked with a dude at boeing now", "24:48", "who he", "24:49", "serviced these pods that it was caught", "24:51", "on the gimbal", "24:53", "that thing is self-rotating it is a", "24:56", "saucer-shaped thing that is rotating", "24:59", "mechanically against the wind", "25:01", "we they all know that this is has to be", "25:04", "a gravity-propelled program we we", "25:05", "understand the science that it takes to", "25:07", "do it", "25:08", "we can't replicate jeremy pull that so i", "25:10", "i always do that it's okay", "25:12", "we have it right up to your face we", "25:13", "can't replicate it right with our", "25:15", "material sciences", "25:16", "our best information at this time we", "25:18", "can't replicate this technology but we", "25:20", "do understand how it works", "25:22", "fundamentally fundamentally we just", "25:24", "don't have the power to actually make it", "25:26", "the material science even just the", "25:28", "actual physical material science the", "25:29", "materials it's made out of and that's", "25:31", "what's been in the news now", "25:32", "metamaterials that there", "25:34", "are materials from craft that we have", "25:37", "george will talk about that but lazar is", "25:40", "parallel with what we're seeing today", "25:42", "yeah and what's also really", "25:44", "bonkers is in 89 he was talking about", "25:46", "element 115.", "25:48", "he wasn't even scientifically proven to", "25:50", "exist until 2013.", "25:52", "so in 1989 he was talking about this is", "25:54", "science fiction he's making things up", "25:56", "in 2013 they actually were able to", "25:59", "create", "26:00", "for a brief moment an element 115 which", "26:03", "is this insanely dense element that they", "26:05", "believe", "26:06", "is perhaps the propulsion system for", "26:09", "this craft", "26:10", "it was always theorized of course", "26:12", "element 115 but", "26:13", "fabricating it was an achievement but", "26:16", "yeah if you're talking about being a", "26:17", "winner", "26:18", "every time history writes itself right", "26:20", "bob is", "26:21", "it's insane he's batting 100 he knew", "26:24", "there was a place called s4 there had", "26:26", "been no", "26:27", "no articles about that no mention i", "26:29", "looked for it you know i called nellis", "26:31", "air force base and asked him do you have", "26:32", "a", "26:33", "place called s4 anywhere on the range", "26:35", "yeah", "26:36", "in fact we have more than one so can you", "26:38", "tell me where they are no", "26:40", "can you tell me what goes on there no", "26:42", "well there was a facility at papoose", "26:44", "i i think it was built in the into the", "26:46", "side of the mountain and you can see the", "26:48", "dirt road on the old satellite photos", "26:50", "why were people going down there and", "26:52", "then of course the video he goes out", "26:53", "there with his friends", "26:54", "when he thinks he's going to be killed", "26:56", "or or he's going to disappear and he and", "26:58", "three weeks in a row you've talked about", "26:59", "on this program", "27:00", "and they videotaped this and all the", "27:03", "witnesses who were there have", "27:04", "verified it and it was not over area 51", "27:07", "it was over papua's which", "27:08", "officially has no no facility nothing", "27:10", "has ever been there", "27:11", "bob knew a lot of stuff that he couldn't", "27:13", "have known otherwise and it's", "27:15", "it's been proven and he didn't know", "27:17", "stuff that was disproven", "27:18", "he didn't come out he didn't make up a", "27:20", "bunch of crazy shit that you go", "27:22", "like like the william cooper book right", "27:24", "like", "27:25", "there's a lot of people that have", "27:26", "speculated what that was all about", "27:28", "whether william cooper was just", "27:29", "schizophrenic", "27:30", "whether he was writing some truths mixed", "27:33", "in with crazy things", "27:35", "so you could discount the truth i mean", "27:36", "that is that is a real strategy that the", "27:38", "government will employ", "27:40", "if they know that information is going", "27:42", "to get leaked out", "27:43", "and they want to somehow another", "27:44", "discredit it they'll connect it to", "27:46", "really", "27:46", "loony stuff that is absolutely not true", "27:48", "and you'll say", "27:49", "where did you get that information oh i", "27:50", "got it from behold the pale horse", "27:52", "oh christ did you read all the stuff in", "27:54", "that book right i mean so", "27:56", "there's there's that thought but there's", "27:58", "none of that with bob with bob", "28:00", "everything that he talked it's it's so", "28:02", "eerie every time you turn over a stone i", "28:04", "think i'm going to find", "28:05", "at first that's how george and i met i", "28:06", "thought i was going to see these guys", "28:08", "cooked it up that was my first entry", "28:10", "point in 2012", "28:12", "i thought they cooked it up every stone", "28:14", "you turn over to be clear what george", "28:16", "just said", "28:17", "bob always said there's a place called", "28:18", "site four that was never mentioned", "28:20", "anywhere at papoose", "28:21", "he verified it in 1989 with head of", "28:24", "public relations", "28:25", "who was a homie of his at area 51. we", "28:27", "then call", "28:28", "30 years later and they give us the", "28:30", "funniest fucking answer", "28:32", "trying to not talk about site force so", "28:34", "he confirmed it", "28:35", "every time you turn over a stone man", "28:37", "every time", "28:38", "bob's proven right and it's it's", "28:40", "annoying what was the", "28:41", "experiment that he did with element 115", "28:45", "that you guys videotaped it was that", "28:48", "available", "28:48", "online could someone watch that no", "28:52", "so it was called a cloud chamber test so", "28:54", "he he had this stuff", "28:55", "i know people don't believe that it", "28:57", "exists and he never had any of it", "29:00", "they're welcome to believe it but he had", "29:02", "he had a piece of it he didn't steal a", "29:04", "piece", "29:05", "the only time i ever saw it was in his", "29:07", "lead shield round", "29:08", "disc and he had it uh for a while it was", "29:11", "in another", "29:11", "because it's radio radioactive i think", "29:13", "it's stable i don't think it's", "29:14", "radioactive that's how it was shipped to", "29:16", "him", "29:16", "so it's in a disk protect it from", "29:18", "bombardment because it will become", "29:20", "unstable very quickly that's how", "29:22", "he says they used it in the craft so", "29:23", "yeah he had it in a puck and and fi and", "29:26", "a hockey puck looking um yeah like a", "29:28", "metal sandwich and it's lead", "29:30", "yeah yeah yeah and i showed it and i had", "29:33", "it in the background in one of our", "29:35", "stories just out of an inside joke it's", "29:37", "sitting in there but bob used to keep it", "29:39", "in front of a particle accelerator", "29:40", "that

like jeremy that doesn't show the", "31:38", "cool part of the test it's just the cool", "31:40", "down period", "31:41", "and i'm like well it shows that you", "31:42", "filmed this with your friends back then", "31:44", "and that", "31:45", "at least you believed you had 115. so", "31:47", "what i have", "31:48", "in the film it's not definitive proof", "31:50", "but it shows that", "31:51",

of", "32:39", "this thing", "32:40", "yeah and so he'd he'd have it in there", "32:42", "now the whole sensitivity for him", "32:44", "is his real world implications if he's", "32:46", "telling the

because it was", "33:16", "like", "33:16", "i'm not seeing anything in this this is", "33:18", "what's confusing to me this seems like", "33:19", "nothing", "33:20", "like nothing's going on at all right", "33:22", "that that's the point is that he has a", "33:24", "long version", "33:25", "george blame him yeah it's my fault but", "33:27", "i understand but why is this in the film", "33:28", "then if nothing's happening it was a", "33:30", "splash", "33:31", "over him when he was talking about 115", "33:33", "he doesn't like how", "33:34", "talking about how he got it out but it",

i shared it with some people it", "48:47", "eventually found its way into the u.s", "48:49", "government's hands", "48:50", "and it it tells us basically a lot of", "48:52", "what we now know about

was an icbm base", "49:02", "in the ukraine colonel sokolov says that", "49:05", "a", "49:05", "giant ufo appeared over this base these", "49:07", "are missiles that are trained to go to", "49:09",

control", "49:28", "facilities", "49:30", "lights up like a christmas tree and", "49:32", "whenever this thing was it", "49:33", "entered the launch control codes", "49:36", "the missiles were enabled they start", "49:38", "firing up they're ready to go", "49:40", "and then poof ufo goes away the whole", "49:43", "thing shuts down", "49:44", "it goes back to normal colonel sokolov", "49:46", "said his team he and his team", "49:47", "sent there to investigate it they took", "49:49", "those machines apart", "49:51", "could not figure out what it had done", "49:52", "and he told me on camera",

here", "50:02", "we don't like to admit it but there's a", "50:03", "pretty strong paper trail that it really", "50:05", "did happen", "50:06", "now what is a bigger national security", "50:08",

"51:05", "of the of the water to sixty thousand", "51:08", "feet", "51:08", "in how long so uh less less", "51:11", "less than a second but there's actually", "51:13", "more to it there there was a craft", "51:14", "remember i was talking with commander", "51:16", "favor before this was public", "51:17", "yeah there was a craft under the water", "51:20", "too the tic tac would drop from sixty", "51:24", "thousand feet is what they're saying", "51:25", "sixty to eighty but that's the scan", "51:27", "volume of the spy one radar", "51:30", "so everybody i've talked to said they", "51:31", "were coming from above they were coming", "51:33", "from outer space", "51:34", "dropping down within a second", "51:37", "and stopping on a dime and then making", "51:40", "the movements commander fravor saw", "51:42", "like inside of a glass then he said to", "51:45", "me in our first", "51:46", "talk ever i'll never forget this because", "51:48", "i'm talking to a fighter pilot and i got", "51:49", "a talk fighter pilot and i'm i don't you", "51:51", "know", "51:52", "and he says to me it noticed me i go", "51:55", "what do you mean it noticed you he says", "51:56", "as i was descending rapidly to engage it", "51:59", "it turned its nose and began to", "52:02", "intelligently", "52:02", "mirror my movements came right up by me", "52:06", "and he says faster than you can see a", "52:09", "like you can't even see a bullet leave a", "52:10", "gun", "52:12", "no it's just bam shot off he goes we", "52:14", "don't have anything like that i wish", "52:16", "we did we don't whatever propels that is", "52:19", "not a reactionary propulsion system", "52:24", "meaning it's not pushing something off", "52:26", "the back to get it to go forward like", "52:27", "everything is fire and explosion it's a", "52:30", "field proposal yeah like anything else", "52:31", "we know you've got to have something", "52:32", "going back to go forward rockets we're", "52:34", "still using the same ones from back in", "52:35", "the day", "52:36", "this thing instantaneously without", "52:39", "effects of inertia", "52:40", "can move now and that distortion that's", "52:44", "exactly how bob described these things", "52:46", "would work or do work in his opinion", "52:49", "so commander fraber got to see it now", "52:51", "and these incursions by the way", "52:53", "look there's stuff george reports on", "52:55", "there's a lot he doesn't as a filmmaker", "52:57", "myself", "52:58", "people tell me stories all the time", "53:00", "these incursions", "53:01", "it's not a rarity these are happening to", "53:04", "this day i", "53:05", "just heard about one in guam incursions", "53:08", "over", "53:09", "high security air space over", "53:12", "our weapons systems and in guam there", "53:15", "was just", "53:16", "recently an incursion the pantex", "53:18", "facility", "53:19", "with the igloos where we hold our", "53:21", "nuclear weapons and stuff like that", "53:23", "there are incursions over these so to", "53:25", "george's point", "53:26", "the the reason why maybe all this is", "53:28", "secret is not because we can't handle it", "53:30", "people", "53:30", "flip out maybe we just want to make sure", "53:32", "we fucking get this tech first because", "53:34", "it's a game changer", "53:36", "now let's talk about the people that", "53:37", "have tried to debunk this", "53:39", "and why they're off because they've made", "53:42", "some", "53:42", "debunking claims about some of these", "53:45", "videos", "53:46", "and about the technology that was used", "53:49", "to track these things", "53:50", "that's incorrect where they don't they", "53:53", "don't really understand what they're", "53:54", "debunking right so please please explain", "53:57", "that because", "53:57", "that's one of the things that people are", "53:59", "immediately going to go to they're going", "54:00", "to go well mick west has already", "54:02", "debunked it and", "54:03", "i've read the stuff that he says it's", "54:04", "mental gymnastics", "54:07", "to try to explain it the way he's", "54:09", "explaining it without recognition of the", "54:11", "fact that these things were actively", "54:12", "blocking radar", "54:14", "these things were actively blocking", "54:15", "tracking systems these were", "54:17", "physical crafts this is not like a bird", "54:21", "no or so like a lot of the wacky", "54:23", "theories that he has", "54:24", "are like i wonder you know it's real", "54:26", "weird", "54:27", "like that a smart man can make such", "54:30", "really", "54:30", "bizarre conclusions very weird", "54:34", "almost like someone wants him to do", "54:36", "those", "54:37", "sure i mean look it's so exciting that", "54:39", "that we're seeing something and the", "54:41", "government's saying okay these are ufos", "54:43", "we have", "54:43", "not identified them they have propulsion", "54:45", "techniques", "54:46", "that we don't have and we're not we're", "54:48", "just talking about the videos", "54:49", "let's talk about the debunking okay talk", "54:51", "about the debunking and what his claims", "54:53", "are in the debunking okay so one that i", "54:55", "recently like", "54:56", "you know attacked because it was so", "54:57", "ridiculous is he was saying that", "54:59", "the go fast video which is this you know", "55:02", "object that", "55:03", "goes along uh in a straight line one of", "55:05", "the three videos that was released he", "55:07", "said what was", "55:08", "probably a bird that was his first", "55:09", "theory let's pull up the go fast video", "55:12", "yeah i mean i recently went deep", "55:15", "into talking with uh boeing", "55:18", "experts who who work on these flear pods", "55:22", "they're telling me how they work what", "55:23", "they can capture", "55:25", "why explain what a flare pod is a for a", "55:27", "forward-looking infrared so basically on", "55:30", "fighter planes you have a camera so", "55:33", "here's the video", "55:34", "we're pulling it up right sure that it's", "55:35", "mounted", "55:37", "and it's essentially recording in", "55:40", "thermal imagery these things are", "55:42", "this is not instagram these things are", "55:44", "weapons systems", "55:45", "that are highly trained to be able to", "55:48", "accurately represent", "55:50", "uh spatial awareness and to be able to", "55:52", "target", "55:53", "you know enemy combatants that's this is", "55:55", "not an iphone an instagram", "55:57", "these are weapons for us so out of the", "56:00", "three videos", "56:01", "if we just look at this one although i", "56:03", "like the tic tac one with commander", "56:05", "fraber and i like the gimbal one those", "56:06", "are awesome this one gives us very", "56:08", "little information", "56:09", "but the idea that this would be a bird", "56:13", "if you talk to anybody that uses these", "56:15", "pods you don't", "56:16", "you can't pinpoint on a bird you can't", "56:18", "lock a weapon system", "56:20", "on a freaking bird well look how fast", "56:23", "it's going too", "56:23", "well here's what's so interesting is", "56:26", "everybody can debate speed", "56:27", "so this is where it's locked in on it", "56:29", "right so the weapon system is locked in", "56:31", "on this thing and it's tracking it now", "56:33", "right and and they got real excited when", "56:35", "they locked it because it's", "56:36", "they they said boxed a moving target", "56:38", "right they so here's the deal though", "56:40", "out of anything i could say about this", "56:42", "video because there's not a lot of", "56:43", "information in there", "56:44", "what i can say is that object you're", "56:47", "seeing is colder than the surface of the", "56:49", "ocean", "56:50", "now i looked up the surface of the ocean", "56:51", "temperature at that location at that", "56:53", "time because we had the information", "56:55", "it was like 65 degrees what propulsion", "56:58", "system so okay so a bird a bird is about", "57:01", "a hundred and let's say five degrees", "57:02", "like a seagull", "57:03", "sea goals can go maybe 15 miles an hour", "57:05", "i don't know how fast they can go", "57:07", "but there they wouldn't they wouldn't be", "57:09", "colder than the ocean they'd be", "57:11", "hypothermic and", "57:12", "dead it cannot be a bird because this uh", "57:15", "what we're seeing is a colder object", "57:18", "than the surface of the water", "57:19", "that's why you're seeing it white and", "57:21", "how fast is it going that's under debate", "57:23", "there's different um", "57:25", "interpretations yeah so i'm i'll give", "57:28", "you one interpretation about you know", "57:29", "240 miles an hour some people say", "57:32", "and then they can argue well the fastest", "57:34", "bird in a nosedive could go that fast", "57:36", "back up we have an object that is colder", "57:40", "than the surface of the ocean that", "57:42", "immediately gets rid of the bird", "57:45", "theory because a bird would be", "57:46", "hypothermic and drop like a paperweight", "57:48", "into the water", "57:49", "it cannot fly at that so that's the", "57:52", "piece of information i would attack that", "57:54", "debunking with but this video", "57:55", "when you're watching that if it is going", "57:57", "200 miles an hour", "57:59", "that's not outside of what's possible", "58:01", "with", "58:02", "with spacecraft or aircraft or or just", "58:05", "planes", "58:05", "right but it's cold i understand that", "58:08", "that's pretty cool but it is", "58:09", "no it's very interesting but it's not", "58:11", "moving anywhere near as fast as the tic", "58:13", "tac", "58:14", "no no no this is just something because", "58:16", "this is part and george can tell you", "58:17", "this was part of a much", "58:18", "bigger series of events so like the", "58:21", "gimbal craft", "58:22", "itself that's another debunking thing", "58:24", "they said it's a plane", "58:25", "banking away and you're seeing it", "58:27", "through thermal first of all talk with", "58:28", "the pilot", "58:29", "not fucking so this is the gimbal yeah", "58:32", "the gimbal is pulling it up right now", "58:33", "and how fast is this thing supposed to", "58:35", "be going you know the speed from what i", "58:37", "recall wasn't registered", "58:40", "on the um on the radar it's not that", "58:42", "it's going fast if you talk with the", "58:43", "pilots", "58:44", "it was rotating it was spinning like a", "58:46", "top and", "58:47", "for like 11 hours without refueling i", "58:50", "mean the thing was just sitting out", "58:51", "there this was not", "58:52", "a this is an occurrence that happened", "58:54", "over a course of many many weeks", "58:57", "now when it rotates like that the", "58:59", "debunking theory", "59:00", "is that you're seeing a plane bank so as", "59:03",

"78:26", "actually did an analysis and it was done", "78:28", "with two types of", "78:29", "metallic tools but look at all the", "78:32", "jagged edges", "78:33", "they said they so they took samples and", "78:35", "they sent them to two pathology labs", "78:38", "didn't tell the guys what they're", "78:39", "looking for you tell us what you can see", "78:41", "and this the pathologist said that two", "78:44", "instruments had been used", "78:45", "one was a heavy machete type instrument", "78:47", "that had been hacked", "78:48", "and then there is a scalpel that had", "78:50", "surgically removed", "78:51", "a lot of the flesh underneath it looks", "78:54", "like something", "78:55", "killed it and then they moved it to that", "78:56", "spot i mean if i had a guess", "78:59", "the way it's eaten though i mean it", "79:01", "looks like it was eaten well there's no", "79:02", "teeth marks there are", "79:04", "metallic marks meaning they", "79:09", "okay so something sharp sliced it so i", "79:12", "think the bigger point is this was", "79:13", "happening on this ranch", "79:15", "with owners prior to owners prior to", "79:17", "owners i got to", "79:18", "talk to a lot of people so here's the", "79:22", "deal the connection of this", "79:23", "so george does this thing he reports on", "79:26", "this for for 20 years", "79:27", "that the government is now studying this", "79:29", "ranch right because of deployment or", "79:31", "because of", "79:32", "all this weird stuff why is the", "79:34", "government spending money", "79:36", "through ossap to study this ranch and", "79:38", "other things and that's where it gets", "79:39", "really fucking interesting", "79:41", "what happens after with our government", "79:43", "programs and that's what you know", "79:44", "this um is before we get to that this", "79:46", "image like the the jagged edges", "79:49", "around the rib cage that's supposedly", "79:51", "sliced that looks like", "79:53", "hacked okay i mean look it could let's", "79:56", "say it's people doing this", "79:57", "you know two farmers to get them out of", "79:59", "there let's say it's some program i mean", "80:01", "although the cattle mutilation thing you", "80:03", "gave me a stack of documents this big", "80:05", "has been studied by the fbi it was", "80:09", "it's happened all over the country no", "80:10", "one has ever been caught", "80:13", "not a single person more than 10 000", "80:16", "cases", "80:16", "with all the same types of cuts i mean", "80:18", "this is not my exercise", "80:19", "i've seen a lot of that it's really", "80:21", "weird there isn't really weird and the", "80:23", "lack of blood is the weirdest part of it", "80:26", "because if see like what makes sense to", "80:29", "me", "80:29", "um is that something killed that", "80:33", "they they butchered it they chopped all", "80:35", "the meat off of it and then they removed", "80:37", "the carcass from that area", "80:39", "and dropped it off there yeah that's", "80:40", "what it looks like if i had a gas", "80:42", "that's what nids thinks there's no way", "80:44", "that it was killed", "80:46", "right there because you're seeing fresh", "80:48", "clean hay", "80:49", "underneath it everywhere there's no", "80:51", "blood which doesn't make any sense at", "80:53", "all", "80:53", "i think the question is is this a", "80:54", "government program is this something or", "80:56", "is this a scare tactic it's been", "80:57", "happening since the 50s like what is a", "81:00", "weird scare tactic", "81:00", "so click on that one below it jamie that", "81:02", "the brown one with the green yeah that", "81:04", "one please", "81:05", "thank you that's that's a weird one too", "81:07", "like there's like a", "81:08", "hole cut out and there's a bunch of", "81:11", "these they found", "81:12", "all over the country and was weirdness", "81:14", "like organs removed", "81:15", "but the weirdest part about it is it's", "81:17", "almost always there's no blood", "81:19", "yeah i just investigated one which i", "81:22", "never thought i would do but i got a", "81:23", "call from a guy in texas you have to see", "81:25", "it physically yeah so right before", "81:26", "lockdown i go out and i'm like this is", "81:29", "so wild i gotta check this out", "81:31", "the guy calls me it's a pretty freshy", "81:33", "one at this point now i'm no", "81:34", "expert but i went and got samples and", "81:36", "took them to labs and this sort of thing", "81:38", "to see if there were tools used", "81:39", "so you got here's my experience you get", "81:41", "pictures of this yeah i filmed", "81:43", "it on your phone i'll show you after i", "81:44", "got on my phone yeah", "81:46", "so i got great foot great fucking photos", "81:48", "weird well listen man", "81:50", "air drop them to me now we'll send them", "81:51", "to jamie and we'll put it up on", "81:53", "on the screen so other people could see", "81:55", "okay so let me", "81:56", "yeah after the show is not going to help", "81:58", "us okay while you're looking i'll tell", "81:59", "them about uh", "82:00", "one of the theories about the cattle", "82:02", "mutilations that dr kelleher dr colin", "82:04", "keller developed was that uh", "82:06", "somebody is tracking the spread of like", "82:08", "mad cow prions", "82:10", "through the food supply and that they've", "82:12", "been doing it under the guise of", "82:14", "ufos since no one would take ufos and", "82:16", "cattle mutilation seriously", "82:18", "they just do it in helicopters and", "82:20", "they're instead of just stealing these", "82:22", "cattle they're tracking how far this", "82:24", "these indestructible prions uh travel", "82:27", "through the food supply because it's in", "82:28", "uh cattle it's in pigs it gets uh", "82:32", "fed into chickens and things of that and", "82:34", "feed it's in deer", "82:36", "it's called chronic wasting disease in", "82:38", "in some circles", "82:40", "it's just weird well quantity it's just", "82:42", "wasting diseases isn't that a that's a", "82:44", "different prion disease", "82:46", "than um mad cow well it's a variation", "82:49", "cruttsville jacob disease i think too so", "82:52", "um", "82:53", "the same kinds of things in different", "82:54", "species", "82:56", "it is indestructible again so you hit a", "82:59", "deer that's got this", "83:00", "and you grind it up and you feed it to", "83:02", "pigs the pigs get it", "83:03", "yeah and then um and then it could be", "83:06", "passed on to other species and it shows", "83:07", "up in different ways", "83:08", "kelleher was exploring the idea well", "83:10", "whether or not it it might be the cause", "83:12", "of alzheimer's or", "83:14", "a version of mad cow in humans do you um", "83:18", "they're all going to you right now this", "83:19", "so this is a recent oh it says", "83:21", "downloading", "83:22", "so oh i'm downloading them and then oh", "83:24", "right right right", "83:25", "are you on the wi-fi no but it's coming", "83:28", "through here we go it's about to go to", "83:30", "you", "83:30", "it says waiting okay got it

was", "84:46", "on your show it was the ones in oregon", "84:48", "had just happened", "84:50", "up at that ranch and i thought well okay", "84:51", "if i'm ever gonna do it", "84:53", "now is the time to do it so i go i get", "84:56", "this call", "84:57", "now remind you this is a rancher this is", "84:59", "like this is their livelihood", "85:01", "it's this huge huge area of land that", "85:04", "right there stop right there", "85:05", "they're a very religious community", "85:09", "nobody we go out to the middle of this", "85:12", "land", "85:13", "and in the middle there's this dead cow", "85:17", "no blood no blood and and he had seen it", "85:19", "prior and and the reason he called me", "85:21", "is because in my movie you could see", "85:23", "this special kind of slice like a jagged", "85:26", "slice that is common to these types of", "85:27", "things they think are real mutilations", "85:29", "and he's looking at it he's like that's", "85:30", "exactly like in the movie", "85:32", "now this is a straight shooter he's a", "85:34", "religious guy he had to ask his pastor", "85:36", "if he could even like go on camera with", "85:38", "me", "85:39", "it freaks him out so he sees this now he", "85:41", "sees dead animals all the time", "85:42", "and he saw this cow you said before", "85:45", "accidentally he was out shooting bb guns", "85:47", "with his kid", "85:48", "and he's on this big part of land and he", "85:50", "sees this down", "85:51", "bull and he goes over to it he's looking", "85:53", "at it and it's unlike anything he has", "85:55", "ever seen in all of his years before it", "85:57", "had", "85:57", "surgical cuts there is no doubt somebody", "86:01", "killed cut up this animal with those", "86:05", "classic", "86:05", "like the ear gone uh two types of tools", "86:09", "like a scissor type but by the way i", "86:11", "tried to cut it it is not", "86:13", "easy to cut so they had sharp tools and", "86:15", "then there's like a", "86:16", "very thin slice kind of cut", "86:19", "so i got to take it get samples take", "86:21", "them to labs and try to see", "86:24", "what type of tools did this how did they", "86:26", "do this with no blood", "86:27", "on the ground and all the soil around it", "86:30", "was dead so i was like well why is it", "86:31", "all dead is that a natural thing", "86:33", "so i took soil samples and took them to", "86:34", "a lab and again i'm outside of my", "86:37", "this is weird to me okay but i i think", "86:40", "there it's a real phenomenon", "86:42", "somebody is killing these animals", "86:44", "something someone", "86:45", "what however you want to say it some", "86:47", "things someone is killing these animals", "86:49", "in a highly", "86:50", "specified technical way that has been", "86:52", "repeated", "86:53", "since the 50s on our fbi has studied it", "86:58", "he has shown me so many reports of these", "87:00", "in association", "87:01", "with discs saucers does this guy", "87:05", "have any association with discs or", "87:07", "saucers or anything no he's just a a", "87:09", "a guy that owns the one they just found", "87:11", "this cattle", "87:12", "weirdly

back", "87:21", "in history", "87:21", "like i'm looking at the cuts is", "87:23", "specifically", "87:24", "they're very unimpressive what that does", "87:27", "doesn't look like a laser did it or some", "87:30", "incredibly sharp scalpel no it was like", "87:32", "it was like a", "87:33", "serrated one was a serrated tool that's", "87:36", "the thing i'm saying it's like something", "87:38", "that we could do", "87:38", "oh absolutely we'd have to somehow do it", "87:41", "though", "87:42", "on in texas land where the guy would", "87:44", "shoot you in the face if you go and try", "87:46", "to touch one of his cows", "87:47", "that's the other thing no one's ever", "87:49", "been caught never", "87:51", "that's what's weird yeah it's weird it's", "87:53", "frustrating too",

heard", "88:10", "that story before and this is", "88:12", "very convenient that it happens just", "88:13", "when some giant disk shows up", "88:15", "but it does happen that their car", "88:17",

"but", "88:33", "you can't publish it there's no real", "88:36", "physical proof", "88:37", "so they just left it there and i had", "88:38", "tried to do a documentary", "88:40", "ended up i talked to him and let me", "88:41", "write a book about it but you know", "88:43", "if if people if you're looking for", "88:46", "physical evidence and solid proof and", "88:48", "they don't happen what is the what's the", "88:51", "primary theory", "88:51", "are there any primary theories of why", "88:54", "they do this to cows", "88:55", "why someone's doing this to cows", "88:58", "you know you need to catch somebody and", "89:00", "ask them i mean you know that's that's", "89:02", "that's really look man it'll be weird", "89:04", "that no one's been caught", "89:06", "investigate the unexplained

"96:39", "who was a physicist who worked with", "96:41", "bigelow on both", "96:42", "nids and bass made a presentation in las", "96:45", "vegas in", "96:45", "uh june of 2018 where he says yeah

"maybe you can talk more about it", "98:32", "that the next piece of information is", "98:34", "that there are reverse engineering", "98:35", "programs", "98:36", "which will then make everybody have to", "98:38", "look at lazar's story a little bit", "98:40", "differently once", "98:41", "again if we admit that we are trying to", "98:44", "reverse engineer", "98:45", "either materials or actual
