these", "37:32", "little aliens are inside of it they're", "37:33", "probably robots I would assume that they", "37:35", "if unless they figured out some", "37:37", "incredible way to bypass space and time", "37:40", "into fold space and create a wormhole", "37:43", "and punched through life that didn't", "37:44", "event horizon and all these you know", "37:45", "physics documentaries they talked about", "37:47", "the possibility of using wormholes and", "37:49", "it's all like crazy theoretical shit but", "37:52", "until they figure out how to do that and", "37:53", "send like monkeys back and forth for a", "37:55", "few years they're not gonna mean why", "37:57", "wouldn't they just send robots just like", "37:59", "we're sending a robot to Mars I mean it", "38:01", "looks like a

you would fill out like specs like", "39:09", "you know hey I want a 300 Celeron", "39:11", "processor and this and that and they", "39:13", "would put together computer for you but", "39:14", "they

crazy", "44:16", "so you gotta think how many like", "44:18", "remote-controlled like saucers do they", "44:20", "have how many remote-controlled means", "44:22", "some of the drones that they have now", "44:24", "they look completely is early seventies", "44:27", "the Martians landed in Hudson County", "44:29", "Park mid seventies when they landed so", "44:33", "but since then it's it's there's

said", "46:39", "hey Joey what do you think it's gonna be", "46:40", "like in 2015 Oh fucking space travel for", "46:43", "sure right everybody thought we'd have", "46:45", "bases on the moon by now everybody", "46:48", "thought would be flying around in jets", "46:49", "everybody would be going all over the", "46:51", "place and hover cars back to the future", "46:53", "this was the year that
