you mean", "00:11", "exactly like when I went in at a certain", "00:15", "point I knew how to be you know very", "00:19", "relaxed going in then let it kill a cold", "00:22", "impact go within and

breaths like that", "00:45", "very conscious in the cold the cold is a", "00:48", "force and it has his impact and you go", "00:51", "along with the cold and what it does in", "00:54", "the figure on

do this with Overeem as", "04:32", "well and he feels wonderful", "04:36", "take a man fully letting go okay five", "04:43", "times more deeply and letting go deeply", "04:49", "at letting go deeply in let it go two", "04:54", "times more letting go and stop just stop", "05:02", "witness without air in the lungs you are", "05:07", "able to stay much more than normally", "05:12", "than normally", "05:13", "why because we change your chemistry", "05:16", "carbon dioxide went out Oh to end up", "05:19", "filled up all the cells and pH levels go", "05:23", "up then we are able to tap into the",

great man", "07:18", "nice you're haha feel good huh yeah yeah", "07:23", "yeah that's okay two thirty uh yeah when", "07:29", "you feel the urge to breathe you breathe", "07:30", "in fully and keep it for 10-15 seconds", "07:34", "then that's one rock boolean and keep it", "07:37", "and now will you press your belly the", "07:44", "neck and then the head now you are able", "07:48", "to tap into the brainstem and yeah", "07:53", "that's him if we would do it in again", "07:57", "you would you know sorry got very", "08:00", "lightheaded is it something in that", "08:01", "breathing the breathing is yeah sure so", "08:04", "what explain to people at home what I'm", "08:06", "doing is I'm breathing in all the ways", "08:08", "as deeply as I can but I'm not breathing", "08:11", "out all the way yeah", "08:12", "I'm just breathing out a little bit and", "08:13", "then I'm breathing in more I'm just", "08:15", "breathing out a little bit I'm breathing", "08:17", "in more and breathing out a little bit", "08:18", "yes and if you breathe breathing", "08:21", "completely you get all the oxygen", "08:23", "possible inside if you just let it go", "08:27", "then you get it to
