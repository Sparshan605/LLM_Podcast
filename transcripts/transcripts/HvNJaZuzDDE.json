happens to be in those dick pills", "101:53", "you certainly can", "101:54", "yes but but there's one narrative that", "101:56", "you that took clear that you could say", "101:58", "what's in these dick pills I'm not", "101:59", "saying I'm can do that that's true but", "102:01", "it's in such a small amount in his body", "102:04", "and it wasn't in his body before and it", "102:06", "wasn't in

rich", "105:16", "Anka as I say his name you're talking", "105:17", "about the one test the what I'm talking", "105:20", "about is the study that shows these", "105:21", "metabolites is all from this

it", "107:27", "the number one question was was it", "107:32", "cocaine that was tainted with creatine", "107:33", "that was that that was where people", "107:36", "thought it came from yeah because it's", "107:37", "really calm according to Nowitzki when", "107:39", "he was working for the government that", "107:40", "would be a really common thing that", "107:43", "creatine was used in cocaine to cut it", "107:47", "because it looks like coke it cuts with", "107:49", "coke it's normal it's not toxic so they", "107:51", "would always mix in cheap creatine with", "107:53", "cocaine to make more coke make sense", "107:56", "yeah it makes sense and he that's what", "107:57", "that's what Nowitzki believed but that's", "107:59", "not what he believed but he believed", "108:01", "that was a poss", "108:02", "ability I've heard all sorts of", "108:04", "possibilities yeah it'd be answer to", "108:05", "know the actual truth yeah well you know", "108:10", "we're not gonna know that I think we", "108:13", "know as much as we're gonna know unless", "108:14", "John comes out was John retires and like", "108:17", "you know I had I had a doctor and he", "108:20", "would stick it in my fingernails and see", "108:22", "him slowly release you know some high", "108:24", "advanced microdose he would never admit", "108:27", "that though nobody ever admitted wrote", "108:29", "it unless they get caught it tarnish", "108:31", "your legacy unless it's like an MLB", "108:33", "thing but so many people were quick to", "108:35", "jump on the he's a cheater bandwagon I'm", "108:38", "like man you got you gotta be careful of", "108:41", "God careful with that yeah be careful", "108:43", "that but also you got to be careful with", "108:45", "that but also you should be suspicious",

you can", "108:59", "do that well they definitely didn't do", "109:01", "that he lost a lot I'm saying that's", "109:03", "what the fans do that's what the phone", "109:05", "you know some people can do that I think", "109:07", "it's okay to go Ghana it's just I don't", "109:09", "know man like it's too much smoke here", "109:11", "for me it's okay to do that what it's", "109:12", "not okay to do is to say he was cheating", "109:15", "he's but you know he's busted why do you", "109:18", "have the stuff in his system it's fine", "109:21", "to say why is you have the stuff in the", "109:23", "system well that's what I said right but", "109:25", "they showed why you had an in system", "109:27", "yeah but doesn't mean you should have it", "109:28", "in your system no you definitely she's",

some", "109:37", "shit that's going on right now that they", "109:39", "haven't figured out yet that's going to", "109:41", "be revealed yeah I think so the the the", "109:45", "the drugs and those in that underworld", "109:48", "is always ahead of the of the testing oh", "109:50", "he's always always", "109:51", "that's what Nowitzki said at first but", "109:54", "now he thinks it's reached this point", "109:56", "where the testing is so good do you know", "109:59", "the testing threshold that he tested", "110:01", "positive for for the picograms", "110:03", "is five two to five thousand times", "110:07", "stronger than the water threshold yeah", "110:11", "so we here to have 2,000 to 5,000 times", "110:14", "more of it in his system", "110:16", "or two thousand to five thousand two", "110:18", "thousand percent numbers are tough to", "110:19", "keep up with I don't remember", "110:21", "Andy Foster told me what it was either", "110:22", "way but an insane amount of much higher", "110:26", "quantities this shit for him to test", "110:29", "positive in water like these these tests", "110:32", "that they use now are insane so where", "110:35", "the doctors will in the Underground's", "110:37", "know this is the thing they're doing", "110:38", "well maybe but this is the thing they're", "110:40", "doing now well the thing is like if it's", "110:42", "so low you're not gonna have a", "110:43", "performance enhancing benefit it has to", "110:45", "actually be in your system in order to", "110:47", "have a performance enhancing benefit but", "110:49", "now in 2019 they're actually considering", "110:52", "lowering their standards so that say if", "110:55", "you do take some creatine and does have", "110:58", "the tiniest trace amount of Austrian or", "111:01", "something like that that's not going to", "111:02", "show up positive any which is how maybe", "111:05", "they should do it because it's so strict", "111:07", "now we're right it's tainting guys",

fucked up man", "111:17", "and then on top of that everybody knew", "111:20", "that he was under suspicion and josh has", "111:22", "tested positive for four so everybody", "111:24", "assumed that he was doing something but", "111:25", "though", "111:26", "novitskiy told me that the stuff the", "111:27", "testing is so good now that if you and I", "111:29", "were in this room and I had a jar of", "111:31", "creatine that had steroids in it and I", "111:34", "popped it open and the fucking dust got", "111:36", "in the air and we ingested that dust we", "111:39", "would both test positive from opening a", "111:41", "jar in a room and that's crazy good for", "111:44", "them but I think there's a Elon Musk of", "111:46", "steroid peds out there who's like yeah", "111:48", "cool man you guys are testing for this", "111:49", "we're over here you dumbass daddy's got", "111:51", "a lot of Y's and Z's in his name yeah", "111:53", "geez yeah yeah it's just fuck it was", "111:57", "like a
