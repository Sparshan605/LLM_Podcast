no the fight that", "42:01", "make sense but that's that's that makes", "42:04", "sense no one's trying to stop that from", "42:06", "happening what when the UFC is not", "42:07", "willing to pay a certain amount of money", "42:09", "it's because they don't think they're", "42:11", "gonna get a certain amount of money it's", "42:12", "not because they're trying to avoid", "42:14", "getting paid

we don't want to do that", "42:23", "cuz we don't wanna give Tire in power", "42:24", "they don't think like that they think", "42:26", "like there are numbers people they're", "42:28", "trying to make pay-per-view buys and if", "42:31", "you only sold 300,000 pay-per-view buys", "42:33", "because the wonderboy fight there's not", "42:35", "much they can do about that", "42:36", "I mean it's
