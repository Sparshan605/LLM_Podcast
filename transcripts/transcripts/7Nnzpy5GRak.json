almost", "126:41", "always on the right right and that's", "126:43", "fine but I'm telling you that like again", "126:45", "I didn't do a deep dive on all of this", "126:48", "because I read about it because it was", "126:49", "at a forefront of discussion so I read", "126:51", "about it all night and my conclusion was", "126:53", "that they started pulling up all of", "126:54", "these studies and

behind that org is someone", "127:02", "that was being funded so to me the issue", "127:04", "got too politicized for me to believe", "127:06", "that global warming was something that", "127:08", "was

reputation on", "127:27", "false data what what they're saying is", "127:29", "not that the only reason why the world", "127:32", "is getting warm is because human beings", "127:34", "that the only reason why the climate", "127:36", "isn't totally static for the rest of", "127:38", "eternity because of human beings what", "127:40", "they're saying is we are negatively", "127:42", "impacting our own environment and we're", "127:45", "doing it because we existing knowledge e", "127:48", "and we use coal and fossil fuels and", "127:52", "emissions and we're raising our co2", "127:54", "levels and this is based on data yeah", "127:57", "and this is this is something that you", "127:59", "can look at you could look at the data", "128:00", "and and and follow where they're getting", "128:02",

the fuck you I just said that I", "128:42", "said you asked me and I said this", "128:46", "wouldn't be the hill I chose to die on", "128:47", "because I don't I don't why do I say you", "128:49",

believe", "129:12", "in it you you're saying really clearly", "129:13", "that you don't think it's real yeah I", "129:15", "mean I think it would be the same if I", "129:16", "said to you like you know do you believe", "129:19", "in God right no I would say I don't know", "129:23", "you would say if so if that's like this", "129:25", "is sort of like linguistics though no I", "129:26", "would say I don't know I always say", "129:29", "people say like I believe I believe it", "129:32", "or I don't right so it's like if you say", "129:33", "I think a lot of people say they don't", "129:35",

where I'm", "130:10", "influencing on a college campus what's", "130:13", "your opinion I would say I have none I", "130:14", "bet you would say I don't believe it", "130:16", "what you just did that is absolutely not", "130:18", "what you just do we there are so many", "130:20", "instances where you could watch it's", "130:22", "just like and you can ask dave rubin", "130:23", "when he asks me a question I say I don't", "130:25", "have any peanut about a different", "130:26", "subject", "130:26", "yeah because you're you and I are having", "130:27", "a conversation one-on-one I'm not I'm",

the pieces of that", "130:50", "you don't have evidence whatever it just", "130:52", "seemed a little shady and I felt that it", "130:53", "was politicized but I think I have a", "130:55", "right to
