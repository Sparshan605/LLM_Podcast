don't but because in his previous", "27:45", "fights and fights after that he hasn't", "27:46", "been using all of his tools well I think", "27:49", "there's a strategy for that though the", "27:50", "Frankie Edgar fight I really believed", "27:52", "that he didn't use his kicks because I", "27:54", "think he felt like Frankie was training", "27:57", "for those kicks and he was training to",

endurance he measures you and", "28:43", "he starts to put it on you put it on you", "28:45", "what max is really good at is distance", "28:48", "control really good at movement and", "28:50", "distance control and just not being", "28:52", "there as all fighting seeking long yep", "28:54", "and the kill doesn't in the cut doesn't", "28:55", "kill him for 145 he's very tall very", "28:58",
