o'clock to the point where we got to", "09:14", "do something so they start to put me in", "09:17", "the bathtub just because we do most of", "09:19", "our cuts in the baths you know when you",

and", "09:39", "just pouring it on me and you know", "09:41", "doctors are in and now this twin 12", "09:44", "people in and out of the the the hotel", "09:46", "room to make sure I'm okay and to make", "09:48", "sure that I could cut the weight and I", "09:50", "was just as such a like an adrenaline", "09:53", "fuckin like on 10 I'm like just get out", "09:56", "you know I'm screaming at everybody", "09:58", "literally I was in the tub I was crying", "10:01", "like my but to me I was like there's no", "10:04", "way I'm not making this weight and six", "10:08", "pounds in about an hour maybe two hours", "10:12", "cuz I weighed in about nine o'clock or", "10:13", "so or I mean uh about 9:30 10:00 or so", "10:19", "six pounds in two hours this it was", "10:22", "brutal but I think that just kept me at", "10:25", "such a such at in on my adrenaline I", "10:28", "never really understood how to bring it", "10:30", "back down you know and probably try and", "10:32", "talk to me and try and tell me like hey", "10:33", "calm down like you know take a few deep", "10:35", "breaths like yeah yeah I'm breathe or", "10:37", "whatever I'm when I wasn't listening to", "10:39", "it",
