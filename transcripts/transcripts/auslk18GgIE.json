when I was", "20:57", "into my career and just kind of getting", "20:58", "you know kind of trying to figure out", "21:01", "like what what's next for me you know it", "21:05", "was hard you know it was just a hard", "21:07", "place because you know I really have", "21:09", "anybody to talk to I didn't really know", "21:11", "what I was gonna do next in my life you", "21:13", "know and then when I started fighting", "21:15", "again I still was in that place where I", "21:18", "just wasn't you know totally back to", "21:21", "fighting my mentality because fighting", "21:22", "is is something mentally that it takes", "21:25", "it takes a certain mentality for you", "21:28", "know and and for me", "21:29", "fighting was something that I did to", "21:33", "exorcise some demons a bit you know but", "21:37", "having some time away from the sport it", "21:39", "allowed me to figure out other ways to", "21:41", "exercise so demon demons and you know", "21:43", "figure out some things around them you", "21:45", "know the things that made me mad at", "21:46", "things that were my fuel before I kind", "21:49", "of made peace with them hmm and then", "21:51", "making peace with a lot of the things", "21:53", "that I was using for my fuel it just", "21:55", "changed the way I fought in a way I've", "21:57", "seen fighting so coming back to fight I", "22:00", "just wasn't that same fighter anymore", "22:02", "and then when I got to the point where I", "22:05", "was like man I can't keep myself like I", "22:07", "was like man I'm not fighting the way I", "22:09", "want to fight and you know there's I", "22:12", "mean what's the point if I can't go and", "22:15", "compete the way I want to I'm only", "22:16", "torching myself so then I decided to", "22:18", "retire but then when I retired I'll", "22:20", "still was in a space where I was like", "22:23", "man there's still something missing so", "22:25", "then when I did the five Meo DMT that", "22:28", "kind of put things in perspective you", "22:30", "know in a whole different way you know", "22:32", "in it and it just it changed me it", "22:36", "changed me a lot has changed the way", "22:38", "that you know I said the way I think the", "22:40", "way I eat everything everything about it", "22:42", "you know so it was a it was soaked with", "22:44", "Arctic and so many so many since it'll", "22:47", "word you know do you think that", "22:49", "something like that would be really", "22:50", "beneficial for fighters that are in the", "22:51", "twilight of their career I think I think", "22:54", "it could be I think I think every", "22:56", "fighter gets to a point where you fight", "22:58", "enough then fighting it kind of it kind", "23:01", "of you kind of get in a weird space", "23:03", "about it and you know I've seen fighters", "23:04", "go through that period where they just", "23:06", "kind of like figuring out that why am I", "23:08", "still doing this you know they've had", "23:10", "great moments inside the cage but then", "23:12", "they have those down moments and those", "23:14", "down moments are the moments where it's", "23:17", "harder to come back from and I think", "23:19", "those are the times where you you know a", "23:22", "psychedelic or something like that could", "23:24", "put things in perspective and and allow", "23:26", "the fighter to see the why behind the", "23:30", "reason they're doing it and maybe create", "23:32", "a new Y you know you're so different", "23:35", "it's funny you know I've noticed that", "23:36", "about you over the last few years of", "23:38",

"23:46", "mean I hate to use the word spiritual", "23:48", "but you seem like a more spiritual more", "23:51", "peaceful guy I'd noticed that so that's", "23:53", "why I was really interested to have this", "23:54", "conversation see what your journey was", "23:57", "yeah it's been it's been one hell of a", "23:59", "journey man you know I'm you know I just", "24:02", "I teamed up with some people in Denver", "24:04", "one of my good friends Dale jolly out in", "24:06", "Denver you know he's the one who told me", "24:10", "about the medicine about the medicine", "24:11", "the told medicine and", "24:13", "after that we just kind of continue to", "24:15", "always link up and we do you know a", "24:18", "bunch of ceremonies together we do", "24:19", "ayahuasca and just just make sure we", "24:23", "always have that connection but it was", "24:25", "through working with him you know I I", "24:28", "became you know part of this group", "24:30", "unlimited sciences and unlimited", "24:33", "sciences what we're doing is um you know", "24:37", "we've been able to we want to make", "24:40", "psilocybin usage because del jolly was", "24:43", "one of the guys who who got who's on the", "24:46", "committee who got it approved for Denver", "24:49", "decriminalizing he was one of the guys", "24:51", "who made that possible you know how it", "24:53", "works so are you allowed to possess a", "24:55", "certain amount of psilocybin in Denver", "24:57", "is that how it works I'm not really too", "25:00", "sure exactly how it all works with that", "25:03", "but I think that they're still working", "25:05", "out the details of how it's going to be", "25:07", "which you can possess on the on the", "25:09", "legal side but with unlimited sciences", "25:14", "you know we've you know we've been able", "25:16", "to take that we want to take the", "25:20", "psilocybin experience where it's one", "25:22", "that people can go to for healing and", "25:25", "help and get consistent consistent", "25:29", "information consistent data on you know", "25:32", "the full spectrum on how you can use it", "25:34", "in a way that's use so we've teamed up", "25:37", "and this has never been done before we", "25:38", "teamed up with John Hopkins University", "25:40", "and we're gonna be part of their study", "25:43", "and we're gonna do like the first real", "25:45", "world world study where we go out and", "25:48", "and you know take information from", "25:50", "people you know people from 18 and up", "25:52", "who can speak in English can sign up for", "25:54", "our our study and you know what you do", "25:58", "is you go in you fill out a", "25:59", "questionnaire and everything is is um", "26:01", "HIPAA protected so no one has to worry", "26:03", "about you know getting in trouble for", "26:05", "what their their usage of civil", "26:07", "assignment but you know John Hopson is", "26:10", "taking all this information and we're", "26:11", "collecting the form and you know what we", "26:15", "want to do is we want to be able to give", "26:17", "this back to them so that they can see", "26:18", "on which way they want to direct their", "26:21", "clinical research you know", "26:23", "and what that can do is you know with", "26:26", "with the unlimited sciences it's it", "26:28", "comes from this group called realm of", "26:31", "caring and realm of caring is out in", "26:34", "Denver and Rama carrying was for medical", "26:38", "refugees during the whole when there was", "26:43", "a lot of refugees for cannabis who", "26:47", "couldn't use in their state came to", "26:49", "Denver where they were able to use it", "26:51", "but when they first came that it wasn't", "26:53", "there wasn't you know any information on", "26:55", "how much you to use because Heather", "26:58", "Jackson and this other girl started", "27:01", "numerous page they started the realm of", "27:03", "caring and it was just them they were", "27:04", "treating their child and their children", "27:07", "they had seizures and epilepsy and stuff", "27:09", "like that so they wanted they tried", "27:10", "everything in a medical field to help", "27:12", "them but they couldn't could not help", "27:14", "him with that so then he went to", "27:15", "cannabis and there was only two of them", "27:18", "doing it so they don't really have much", "27:19", "information to go back from so then they", "27:21", "would share information amongst each", "27:22", "other and then he would ask other people", "27:24", "and then through networking they create", "27:26", "this huge community of people with data", "27:29", "and then they started to come with more", "27:31", "and more data and then they started", "27:33", "working with John Hopkins University and", "27:35", "made a protocol and everything else now", "27:37", "Rommel caring helped thousands of", "27:39", "families all over the world just with", "27:41", "the information and data they may have", "27:43", "been able to collect that's awesome John", "27:45", "Hopkins has been involved until a Simon", "27:47", "research for a while right they had some", "27:49", "thing that they did on near-death", "27:51", "patients yeah people that are close to", "27:53", "death and alleviating the the fear of", "27:56", "passing yeah and that's all and that and", "27:59", "that's and that's one thing that they've", "28:01", "they're they're very interested in", "28:02", "diving into that the mind aspect and", "28:05", "everything and I think that the", "28:07", "real-world study would be good because", "28:09", "what it does is it allows you know it", "28:12", "allows them to put their money and their", "28:14", "resources into where people are actually", "28:16", "using it in the things that are", "28:17", "interesting to the people you know so I", "28:20", "mean it's one thing to have it in a", "28:22", "clinic clinical setting but it's another", "28:23", "thing to do it on your own and you get", "28:25", "the results from it so hopefully just", "28:28", "studying with John Hopkins University it", "28:30", "it definitely changes games and puts", "28:33", "things on a level where people can get", "28:34", "the heal", "28:35", "from the mushrooms have you read any", "28:37", "McKenna stuff a little bit I follow", "28:41", "McKenna a bit you know I listen to him",

theory that Dennis", "29:14", "subscribes to called the stoned ape", "29:18", "theory do you know this theory huh yeah", "29:20", "and this is a really controversial", "29:22", "theater theory but fascinating that they", "29:25", "believe that at least Terrance Terrance", "29:28", "had this idea that one of the catalysts", "29:31", "for human evolution that changed us from", "29:33", "lower primates to human beings was the", "29:37", "consumption of psilocybin and that", "29:38", "animals you know these these pre pre", "29:41", "human primates would flip over cow", "29:44", "patties and

doubling of the human brain size", "29:54", "over a period of two million years is", "29:56", "gigantic mystery like they have no idea", "29:59", "what happened I mean it's a apparently", "30:02",

"rain forests receding into grasslands", "30:32", "and then these undulates these cow cow", "30:35", "like animals that would live on these", "30:36", "grasslands and eat the cow and take", "30:38", "shits and then the manure would grow or", "30:40", "the psilocybin rather would grow in the", "30:42", "manure and they they would follow these", "30:45", "cows around", "30:46", "and then eat there are mushrooms that", "30:48", "would grow in their manure and it also", "30:50", "coincides with the earliest earliest", "30:53", "civilizations with all worship cattle", "30:55", "like Choctaw Hyuk which is one of the", "30:58", "earliest known civilizations they add", "31:00", "these there was a real cattle", "31:02", "worshipping sort of a monastic cult but", "31:06", "the way their culture would operate they", "31:10", "worship cattle and some would say well", "31:12", "that's because they ate them and they", "31:14", "use their milk I'm sure I'm sure that", "31:17", "had something to do with it", "31:18", "but like the Hindus don't even eat them", "31:19", "they just worship them imagine that you", "31:22", "got a billion people living in a place", "31:23", "everyone's starving and they're not", "31:24", "eating the cows they're not even the", "31:26", "most delicious aren't law on the planet", "31:27", "well it's because they grew mushrooms", "31:29", "and the ancient Hindu scripts like soma", "31:33", "is one of the the main sacraments that", "31:36", "they would talk about no one really", "31:38", "understood to this day they're not", "31:39", "exactly sure what soma is but it's some", "31:42", "sort of a psychedelic sacrament and it", "31:44", "probably was a combination of many", "31:47", "things but a big one was most likely", "31:49", "psilocybin was a part of that and that", "31:53", "sort of correspondent with their", "31:54", "relationship with cows that they had", "31:57", "this this worship of cattle though they", "32:00", "wouldn't eat them and the reason is", "32:02", "because God came out of there but in", "32:04", "their eyes you know they would make the", "32:06", "manure the mushrooms that grow in the", "32:08", "manure and I mean there's all sorts of", "32:10", "mushroom iconography and all their", "32:12", "ancient religious artwork and I mean I", "32:14", "think mushroom the know mushrooms that", "32:17", "played a big part in our society yeah I", "32:19", "mean in our civilization in our ancient", "32:22", "civilization for sure I don't think has", "32:24", "been you know properly covered the way", "32:25", "that it could be but right it's amazing", "32:30", "because the minute you you eat a", "32:31", "mushroom at the right dosage you feel it", "32:35", "you feel the fact that it's like oh this", "32:37", "is something ancient because there", "32:40", "there's something that happens when you", "32:42", "go to that place where you you you lose", "32:46", "the you lose itself mmm when you lose", "32:49", "yourself then there's there's something", "32:52", "that that happens that's that's just", "32:54", "magical there really isn't a way to to", "32:56", "explain it or dress it up with words", "32:59", "it's just a mad something magical that", "33:01", "happens once you reach that level yeah", "33:03", "whenever I have these conversations of", "33:04", "people there's two types of people", "33:05", "there's people like you that have the", "33:07", "experiences that go mm-hmm and then", "33:10", "there's people that have no experience", "33:12", "at all that look-alikes", "33:13", "yeah it's mushrooms but I feel bad for", "33:16", "those projects too because I know how I", "33:18", "used to think and I would have dismissed", "33:21", "it the same way I would have said this", "33:23", "is the foolish notions of frivolous", "33:25", "spiritual people that are just being", "33:27", "ridiculous and they think oh it's all", "33:29", "about the mushrooms man and but it is if", "33:33", "you do it you'll realize like oh if you", "33:36", "do any real potent breakthrough", "33:38", "psychedelic any real breakthrough", "33:41", "psychedelic experience is gonna make you", "33:44", "humble it's gonna make you realize like", "33:45", "oh there's more to this than everyday", "33:48", "consciousness yeah is more to this", "33:50", "experience as existence there's", "33:52", "something way bigger and you only can", "33:55", "tap into it through a variety of", "33:57", "different methods whether it's you know", "33:58", "which would you know name your", "34:00", "psychedelic or name your trance-like", "34:02", "state that people can go into there's a", "34:05", "lot of different ways to tap into it but", "34:06", "once you do you realize like this is not", "34:08", "this little thin thing that we're", "34:10", "touching right now this is not", "34:11", "everything right and that's the thing", "34:13", "about it really just cuts through the", "34:15", "whole materialism of everything yeah", "34:16", "really shows that materialism is just a", "34:20", "product of consciousness you know and", "34:22", "sometimes we tend to think that you know", "34:25", "our consciousness

"42:11", "particularly as a fighter right yeah cuz", "42:13", "you you have to I mean it's so the", "42:15", "difference between a champion you know", "42:18", "is about it more than anybody between a", "42:20", "champion and a good fighter so close", "42:22", "it's such a good so close so close it is", "42:26", "and sometimes it's that fucking fire", "42:28", "that anger that fear that drive inside", "42:32", "of you to be elite to be the best and", "42:34", "sometimes that comes with every practice", "42:38", "you have to win everything you have to", "42:40", "do every fucking training session you", "42:42", "have to burn it out if you don't you", "42:45", "feel like you're less then you could be", "42:48", "yeah I agree with that but there's also", "42:51", "the other side of that too where there's", "42:53", "that that that blissful ignorance and", "42:56", "that blissful ignorance is where you", "42:57", "just go out and do something and you do", "43:00", "it a hundred percent great all the time", "43:02", "just because you enjoy and there's not", "43:04", "the pressure of oh I have to do it a", "43:06", "certain kind of way like for instance", "43:08", "when when um when John Jones was first", "43:12", "competing John Jones he competed so", "43:16", "freely because you know it was just like", "43:19", "he was it was just in his nature like he", "43:20", "was just so creative and fought", "43:23", "different because of you know he fought", "43:25", "from that place of just creativity that", "43:27", "ignorant that ignorant bliss you know he", "43:31", "couldn't be beat he didn't believe he", "43:32", "can be beat and you know he will fight", "43:35", "that way and he would do some genius", "43:37", "stuff in there just because of that you", "43:38", "know but then when you have those", "43:40", "experiences where you you know you've", "43:41", "been caught in a fight or you've you", "43:44", "know you made some mistakes in there", "43:45", "then you do know better but then those", "43:48", "those those thoughts it actually slows", "43:52", "you down a bit too because you're not", "43:53", "fully reacting", "43:55", "you're thinking of here would before he", "43:58", "was just kind of like a reaction yeah I", "43:59", "talked about his opening fight the", "44:01", "opening sequence of his fight with", "44:02", "Shogun", "44:03", "I mean he's 23 years old he's fighting", "44:05", "for the world title and he opens up with", "44:07", "a flying knee hey who the fuck does that", "44:09", "that's that that was that oh that that", "44:12", "was that dumb and young that's the best", "44:15", "way to say it but at the same time that", "44:18", "blissful ignorance that's what made that", "44:20", "was his blueprint for so long you know", "44:22", "and and he's turned it into a whole", "44:24", "fighting style just that you know", "44:26", "letting it all hang out letting it fly", "44:28", "and that's what worried me that's why I", "44:31", "thought in his fight with Dominic Reyes", "44:33", "it was gonna be a closer fight because", "44:35", "of the fact that Dominic Reyes now had", "44:37", "that what John used to have being of", "44:39", "that blissful ignorance he didn't really", "44:41", "know how much you know how better John", "44:43", "was or didn't even care he was just kind", "44:45", "of like oh how can what you know I'm", "44:47", "saying he was so confident himself", "44:49", "almost in it in an ignorant blissful way", "44:51", "but it worked out for him you know", "44:53", "well what's interesting about that fight", "44:54", "is first of all it's a great argument", "44:56", "for five-round championship fights", "44:58", "because for the first three rounds", "44:59", "Dominic Reyes was winning yeah the", "45:02", "question is whether he won the third", "45:04", "round that's the one I believe that's up", "45:07", "for grabs most people that I've talked", "45:09", "to think John won the last two clearly", "45:14", "most people most people that I talked to", "45:17", "that are experts most people if you", "45:19", "disagree believe that Dominic grey has", "45:22", "won the first three and the third round", "45:24", "is the one that seems to be well Dominic", "45:27", "scored more but it was close enough", "45:29", "where you could see someone giving it to", "45:31", "John particularly since John was", "45:33", "pressing the action John was pushing", "45:35", "forward maybe you give to John but they", "45:37", "thought Dominic want it but they said if", "45:39", "there's a disputable round it is that", "45:41", "third round yeah I agree", "45:43", "one fucking judge gave John four rounds", "45:46", "to one that's insane yeah this is the", "45:49", "same judge that when I believe blue Luke", "45:53", "Thomas was talking about this I'm sorry", "45:55", "if I'm wrong so I'm not saying the", "45:56", "judges name because I'm not sure if I'm", "45:57", "correct but I believe it's the same", "45:59", "judge that Trevin Giles who fought James", "46:04", "Krause Giles and Kraus was an amazing", "46:07", "fight Giles won", "46:08", "winning the decision but the first round", "46:11", "Kraus had his back for four minutes and", "46:15", "the referee the judge gave that round to", "46:18", "Giles", "46:18", "which is insane I mean for four minutes", "46:22", "Kraus had his back was if the guy was", "46:25", "fighting off chokes Kraus was real close", "46:28", "to submitting him couple times during", "46:30", "those four minutes and the judge the", "46:32", "same judge who gave four rounds to John", "46:35", "Jones gave that first round to Giles", "46:37", "where there was a dude on his back for", "46:39", "four fuckin minutes most of the round", "46:41", "and maybe even a fucking more egregious", "46:45", "fight was Andre Yule versus Jonathan", "46:52", "Martinez that fight was fucking crazy", "46:56", "that fight was crazy that was the most", "46:59", "crazy one Martinez one half fight", "47:01", "Martinez won that fight you will broke", "47:03", "his arm I think you see I'm not sure if", "47:06", "it's a broken arm but he had a", "47:07", "significant injury to his right hand", "47:09", "early in the fight somewhere in between", "47:11", "either the first or the second round not", "47:13", "sure we really couldn't throw a right", "47:14", "hand and it was kind of hanging you", "47:16", "could kind of see it was hanging and", "47:17", "Martinez put in work it was an amazing", "47:19", "performance by him and he got fucked", "47:21", "over man real bad it was bad", "47:23", "decision-making there was a bunch of bad", "47:26", "fights there was a bunch of bad", "47:27", "decisions it wasn't just one it was like", "47:29", "four or five on a card of what 12 fights", "47:33", "11 12 fights I forget how many was from", "47:35", "the opening prelims there was bad", "47:38", "decisions just almost like people who", "47:41", "don't know what they're seeing yeah and", "47:43", "that's crazy too especially when we", "47:45", "reached a point that we have in mixed", "47:46", "martial arts you know I think that we've", "47:48", "we've turned the corner in that meaning", "47:50", "the fact that there's there's so many so", "47:54", "much out there so much knowledge out", "47:56", "there in sport and everything else like", "47:57", "then if you're gonna be judging it you", "47:58", "gotta at least know when somebody is is", "48:01", "winning around I mean you know there's", "48:03", "aspects of John's game that that was you", "48:06", "know a score some point you know he was", "48:08", "always moving forward with the action", "48:09", "mm-hm", "48:10", "but you know even when he was moving", "48:12", "forward the action he wasn't terribly", "48:14", "too offensive he would come with his", "48:16", "legs but you know a lot of times he", "48:18", "would allow he would allow Dominic to", "48:22", "be the first one initiated and then", "48:24", "moving off and it sometimes it seemed", "48:25", "like he was just kind of chasing them", "48:26", "but you know I think that it was it was", "48:32", "that third round that third round was", "48:33", "that that hard Ron to score mm-hmm but", "48:36", "you know is I I think that dom had the", "48:42", "edge but if you're gonna be the champion", "48:45", "you gotta be the champion i don't think", "48:46", "he did that john jones oppressed me so", "48:49", "much with the shots that he was able to", "48:51", "take but more or less the mindset that", "48:53", "john had that that their mindset that", "48:55", "john had in those championship rounds to", "48:58", "me that that showed that this guy is you", "49:02", "know he is a total package and when it", "49:05", "comes to fighting just mentally speaking", "49:06", "you know he's he's somebody who I", "49:08", "thought that was frustrated and working", "49:13", "through his own frustrating in the fight", "49:14", "for his frustration in a fight is is", "49:17", "difficult yeah and so come to his own", "49:19", "frustration and and he just kept that", "49:22", "pressure
