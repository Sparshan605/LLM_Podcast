the reaction", "59:42", "I was making them make like I knew what", "59:44", "motions in my", "59:45", "skilar memory to make them do but it", "59:48", "like I wasn't getting the feedback", "59:50", "because it just like wasn't so that was", "59:52", "one of the first things I noticed was", "59:54", "you know going back into practice and", "59:56", "and watching people's angles and beating", "59:58", "them to it and and like remembering I'm", "60:01", "like damn I don't just have to shoot to", "60:02", "shoot like I can wait and do it when", "60:04", "it's at the right time or I can even", "60:06", "like like take advantage of of the fact", "60:10", "that you know I'm making them step back", "60:12", "or I can flash fire in their face and", "60:14", "and jump on them at their knee-jerk", "60:16", "reaction you know like these things of", "60:18", "like being able to manipulate the", "60:20", "situation and make them adjust to me", "60:22", "like I could see that again and I could", "60:24", "see something were you seeing before", "60:26", "like when I just had go all I had was go", "60:29", "when you didn't see movement like say if", "60:32", "someone's gonna spin and they're like", "60:33", "loaded up their hips you didn't see that", "60:35", "no it's just hit on first what were you", "60:37", "seeing III didn't all I saw was get", "60:40", "there first all I saw

you", "99:03", "are when you're healthy it's hard enough", "99:05", "well and I think especially because the", "99:07", "sport is because I mean it's very", "99:09", "blatantly clear that it's it's this is", "99:12", "not a bracketed sport like this is an", "99:15", "entertainment sport now it's clear like", "99:16", "we're doing what puts butts in the seats", "99:18", "we're doing what's best

weirding out", "131:20", "you're not gonna get out of here I gotta", "131:22", "get out of here it's like it's like", "131:23", "claustrophobia you know that if you just", "131:26", "open that door it's cold air and you're", "131:28", "gonna feel great there's a lot someone", "131:30", "go in just want someone to ask you a", "131:32", "question just let me run out that door", "131:36", "that's right there but that is what", "131:40", "creates those heat shock proteins is", "131:41", "that your body realizes that it's in", "131:43", "this terrible situation where you're way", "131:45", "over heated so your body starts creating", "131:47", "these anti-inflammatory proteins and", "131:49", "that's what's so good for your body they", "131:51", "did a study I think it was in was it in",

doesn't matter because the what", "133:01", "matters is your body reacting to the", "133:03", "temperature change and it doesn't matter", "133:05", "how it's getting to you", "133:06", "they used a regular like hot rocks on", "133:08", "that's what I have regular hot rocks on", "133:10", "but I don't think it matters I think", "133:11", "what really matters is just the extreme", "133:13",

just", "133:29", "think it's just like getting your body", "133:31", "heated up like that and then it cooled", "133:32", "off it just chills everything out mm-hmm", "133:34", "just like a quiet there's like a quiet", "133:37", "afterwards yeah but yeah yeah just", "133:40", "everything feels like it works better", "133:41", "you know and when I do it on a regular", "133:44", "basis you know
