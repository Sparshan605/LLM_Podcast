time where the", "11:58", "cage is shut and the referee is in there", "11:59", "and that guy has control of that until", "12:01", "he brings somebody in and he has to have", "12:03", "control over it

watches it", "83:17", "and they probably watch it with like", "83:19", "Mark Ratner one of the officials you", "83:21", "know and they look at it and make an", "83:24", "informed decision you know and I don't", "83:26", "know what the parameters of that are no", "83:28", "know who gets the call but I would", "83:30", "imagine it's a group I would imagine", "83:32", "there's very little disagreement when", "83:33", "someone's looking at film like that", "83:34", "because they're not biased they don't I", "83:36", "mean these guys are the if you have John", "83:37", "McCarthy and Herb Dean they're looking", "83:39", "at film I guarantee you they're gonna", "83:40", "agree on what it is and it's there's a", "83:45", "lot of debate dispute about that kind of", "83:47", "shit you know it's it's really important", "83:49", "to have those guys that really", "83:50", "completely on top of the rules like", "83:52", "there was one fight where Tim means", "83:55", "fought cowboy Olivera and he hit him", "83:58", "while he was down remember that and we", "84:02", "were trying to figure out whether or not", "84:04", "it was legal and I believe it was Dan", "84:09", "Merck leotta and we even got mark Ratner", "84:12", "on the air and Mark Ratner thought it", "84:14", "was a legal knee because he was down on", "84:17", "one knee with one foot and no hands he", "84:20", "said under the new rules that would be", "84:23", "legal and Big John McCarthy says no it's", "84:25", "not if anything from your feet other", "84:28", "than the soles of your feet are down on", "84:30", "the ground you're still a downed", "84:31", "opponent I was like oh so he had to", "84:34", "explain it to me", "84:35", "after the fight because everybody was", "84:36", "calls it three points of contact but", "84:38", "Olivera literally did not have a foot on", "84:40", "the ground he just had his knee his foot", "84:43", "was up in the air and his other foot was", "84:45", "touching the ground and he got kneed in", "84:47", "the face and we got kneed in the face", "84:49", "they said it was an illegal knee and we", "84:51", "were like how is that the case because", "84:53", "there's there's only two points", "84:55", "of contact there's the knee and the foot", "84:57", "like you're not talking about Nia foot", "84:59", "in the hand it's just two points of", "85:01", "contact but apparently it can't be", "85:03", "anything other than the ball your feet", "85:06", "what it could be is you have the both", "85:09", "balls your feet down on the ground but", "85:11", "you have one hand down that's three", "85:13", "points of contact and under the new", "85:15", "rules that would be legal under the old", "85:18", "rules if you touch the ground at all", "85:20", "it's illegal super confusing right so in", "85:26", "that one it was really important to have", "85:28", "a referee like Big John waiting right", "85:31", "there yeah see he smashes him like see", "85:36", "how he's got yeah the knee means more", "85:39", "than one right that's what they're going", "85:40", "with well I think when it landed that", "85:44", "right foot was elevated and was off the", "85:47", "ground then something similar happened", "85:50", "where the guy delivering the knees like", "85:52", "lifted him up off the ground yeah get", "85:54", "him off the ground", "85:55", "yes yeah guys have done that to lift him", "85:58", "up off the ground and slam knees into", "86:00", "their body because they were touching", "86:02", "with their hands you can do that that's", "86:04", "legal it is a weird rule and it's a rule", "86:08", "that we're gonna have to figure out what", "86:12", "makes sense because the knees to the", "86:14", "head do a downed opponent I feel like", "86:17", "that almost makes sense because that is", "86:19", "a real legitimate move and if someone", "86:23", "can do that to you why is that different", "86:26", "is it too easy like why is that", "86:28", "different than being able to elbow", "86:30", "someone in the face when they're on the", "86:31", "ground because it hits harder is that", "86:34", "what it is okay so it's better so I", "86:37", "can't use it cuz it's better so you can", "86:39", "just elbow me all day long in the face", "86:41", "but you can't knee me in the head and", "86:42", "put me out of my face I don't know who's", "86:45", "right or who's wrong but it's an", "86:46", "effective martial arts technique and", "86:48", "they've eliminated it supposedly for the", "86:50", "safety of the fighters but you got to", "86:51", "figure out like what's legal and what's", "86:54", "not legal like here's another thing this", "86:57", "is a fascinating fight that just took", "86:59", "place between Matt Brown and Diego", "87:01", "Sanchez crazy wild fight as long as it", "87:04", "lasted Matt Brown lands this fucking", "87:07", "beautiful elbow knee palms", "87:09", "away and just boom drops his beautiful", "87:13", "elbow on him I mean it was just", "87:14", "picture-perfect and Diego goes limp like", "87:18", "a sniper just shot him from the", "87:20", "sixth-floor depository I mean it was", "87:22", "perfect", "87:24",

head if you're standing up watch", "87:34", "this boom look how he goes limp I mean", "87:37", "that is Diego Sanchez a fucking warrior", "87:39", "dude for him to go limp like that look", "87:42", "at this", "87:42", "boom totally on the back of the head but", "87:47", "that's okay when you're standing up", "87:49", "that's it's weird if you punch something", "87:50", "in the back of the head like when Matt", "87:52", "Serra fought George I'm pretty sure some", "87:55", "of those shots he blasted him with you", "87:56", "hit him in the back of the head might", "87:58", "even been the first

head and that's a hard", "88:37", "fucking impact from a leg happens all", "88:40", "the time it's totally legal it's weird", "88:42", "because if you get on the ground they're", "88:44", "gonna watch the back of the head watch", "88:45", "the back of the head like even from the", "88:47", "mount I mean even for the guard rather", "88:49", "if you're in someone's guard you're", "88:50", "punched

so dangerous it's everything's", "89:09", "dangerous this is fighting this is MMA", "89:13", "look it's we shouldn't you know what", "89:16", "works the best if you can elbow someone", "89:18", "in the back of the head sometimes how", "89:20", "can we can't do it all the time I'm not", "89:22", "saying that anybody", "89:23", "to change that result the result was", "89:24", "perfect Matt Brown by KO I'm not saying", "89:27", "that what I'm saying is open it up let", "89:31", "guys do with whatever they want to do", "89:32", "and no gloves I'm tired of saying this", "89:36", "take the gloves away", "89:38", "no wraps no hand wraps that would save a", "89:42", "lot you would not be able to get away", "89:45", "with nearly as much everybody would look", "89:46", "like John Wayne par though

in the eyeball", "89:58", "what oh you're protecting your hands oh", "90:02", "that seems like cheating you should be", "90:05", "like if you only hit someone with your", "90:06", "hands so hard that

fucking super", "95:16", "dangerous he's gonna be real motivated", "95:18", "and a win by Aldo would be two gigantic", "95:23", "at this stage of the game", "95:25", "if although could bounce back the way he", "95:27", "bounced back from the mcgregor fight and", "95:29", "outbox Frankie if he could bounce back", "95:32", "in some way figure out what he did wrong", "95:35", "in that first fight and

like well into", "96:28", "the like he looked like he's about 170", "96:30", "something and they would cut down to 145", "96:32", "and real hard for him he would suffer in", "96:36", "the last round of fights like if he", "96:38", "didn't smoke guys early on", "96:40", "sometimes he faded towards the end like", "96:42", "he did with Ricardo Lamas like the end", "96:44", "of the fight Lamas was on
