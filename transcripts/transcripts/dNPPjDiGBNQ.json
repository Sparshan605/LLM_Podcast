just", "06:00", "giving him total benefit of the doubt", "06:02", "and also have after having met him and", "06:04", "just you know having a general rule that", "06:06", "we should try to give some people some", "06:08", "space and assume that they're not the", "06:10", "evil people that we might assume they", "06:12", "are", "06:13", "he probably just kind of looked at the", "06:15", "line and didn't feel like finishing it", "06:18", "and just set out whatever and it just in", "06:20", "it in that", "06:21", "but that caught and that and that", "06:23", "created this you know what actually was", "06:25", "a pretty offensive comment but you know", "06:29", "did he mean it well we'll never really", "06:31", "know now I'll back up and say the whole", "06:33", "premise of that joke was ill-intentioned", "06:35", "I mean they said as much right they said", "06:37", "look at these gross people we don't like", "06:40", "them and just to appear somewhat fair", "06:42", "we'll make fun of one Democrat mm-hmm I", "06:44", "mean they did they did say that so there", "06:45", "you know there was this was the thrust", "06:48", "of the entire skit was obviously not", "06:50",

like a hit man in a porno", "06:59", "film yeah I've been funny yeah and it", "07:01", "would have been okay yeah it's the", "07:03", "whatever it's that part but he's no Joe", "07:05", "Rogan he was just trying to be funny man", "07:07", "that's all it was you know people look", "07:09", "so deeply into why comics do things but", "07:12", "the majority the reason why they say", "07:14", "offensive shit is because they think", "07:15", "it's gonna work", "07:16", "that's why ya they find a thing it's not", "07:18", "like they harbor some deep resentment or", "07:20", "anger towards any protected class or", "07:23", "anything like that this is like what", "07:25", "people who are non comics look into it", "07:27", "guarantee 100% like this is gonna work", "07:30", "that's all it
