everybody gets to have an opinion", "02:29", "and through those opinions you find out", "02:31", "which ones make any sense which ones are", "02:32", "crazy in which but like right now it's", "02:35",

like imagine if your emotions", "05:51", "become something like that like some", "05:53", "people have emotional flare-ups like", "05:55", "other guy blew out his appendix he just", "05:57", "had a

"08:07", "couldn't sleep", "08:07", "you know what it is it's most of the", "08:09", "time it's an injury in your back and it", "08:12", "goes down your leg right but what it is", "08:14", "is your back somewhere in your back I'm", "08:17", "like an expert on being able to butcher", "08:22", "scientific explanations from medical", "08:25", "conditions but right if else given do my", "08:27", "best to get it right I would say it's", "08:30", "your disc bulges out and hits the nerve", "08:33", "and it hurts and the way it hurts it", "08:35", "goes down your leg so you think like you", "08:37", "pulled some in your leg but it's really", "08:38", "something in your back you know and I", "08:41", "was experiencing it really recently man", "08:43", "and I went and got you know what Regina", "08:45", "keen is I told you about that shit", "08:46", "before it they used to do it in Germany", "08:49", "they was a blood spinning proceeded they", "08:52", "still do it in Germany but now they do", "08:53", "it in Santa Mon", "08:54", "and it's a blood spinning procedure", "08:56", "that's like platelet-rich plasma but", "08:58", "they put some other stuff in it we've I", "09:00", "know we've discussed the science behind", "09:01", "it anyway it's amazing at that and like", "09:04", "relaxing all the area around a disc and", "09:07", "anything that's bulging sort of goes", "09:09", "back in and fixes itself it really can't", "09:12", "happen like you don't necessarily have", "09:13", "to get surgery with a lot of people but", "09:15", "some people that have your situation or", "09:17", "my situation to get surgery because the", "09:19", "the discs keeps poking out they said", "09:21", "we're just gonna cut a piece out on and", "09:23", "it can it can help you

juice stem cells stem cells do", "09:45", "you say have to go to like Mexico for", "09:46", "that or no you can do in America for", "09:48", "sure and as an added bonus they'll do it", "09:50", "maybe get out of your own fat right yeah", "09:52", "bro the lipo you a little bit get them", "09:55", "to sculpt you some six-pack but have a", "09:57", "lot let's see you at the store you'll be", "10:02", "like 150 pounds what happened Redman", "10:05", "stem cells yeah I got us for everybody", "10:07", "who needs ten cells and I didn't even", "10:10", "know that you couldn't use plasma", "10:12", "I always sold plasma I didn't know you", "10:13", "could that keep it and use it for good", "10:15", "well this platelet-rich plasma again", "10:19", "I'll fuck this up royally if I try to", "10:21", "actually explain it but they take your", "10:23", "blood out and they spin it and somehow", "10:25", "another by spinning it it separates", "10:27", "through a centrifuge it separates like", "10:28", "this yellow stuff that's like there's", "10:31", "the platelets and there's this other", "10:33", "stuff like that there's like significant", "10:35", "parts to blood alright so they take this", "10:38", "platelet-rich plasma", "10:40", "how are the fuck they do this and the", "10:43", "difference between that like regular PRP", "10:45", "androgenic een is some other factors so", "10:47", "they squirt that yellow serum into your", "10:49", "back it's not cheap it's not covered by", "10:52", "insurance but goddamn does it work I", "10:54", "mean it works way better than I mean", "10:56", "it's like you got a Belgian like if", "10:58", "usually if you have a bulging disc", "11:00", "you're kind of fucked you know cuz", "11:03", "people are like god damn what can I do",

"11:12", "pain sometimes that helps relax", "11:14", "everything but this shit fixes it", "11:17", "that'll be a good company to invest in", "11:20", "you just need a doctor in the machine", "11:22", "did like it's a little more complicated", "11:23", "now I need actual scientists lab", "11:25", "technicians it might be just a spinning", "11:29", "machine it takes plasma and makes it a", "11:31", "like a latte out of it", "11:32", "Jamie what were you gonna tell me about", "11:34", "Epstein right before the show started", "11:36", "three stars I woke up to seeing you last", "11:42", "night

gigantic", "12:52", "international case hey what happened to", "12:54", "the cameras all over the fucking broke", "12:56", "man", "12:56", "I don't know sucks hung himself it need", "12:59", "a couple days to make the videos and", "13:00", "stuff like that right right yeah exactly", "13:02", "that's the price of a fake he tried to", "13:05", "hang himself before I know okay", "13:08", "don't do that again hey go wrong they", "13:10", "won't give me my belt cue my shoelaces", "13:12", "give me whatever the fuck that guy", "13:14", "strangle me with these photos are all", "13:17", "fake right", "13:19", "I mean I don't know why it's they're", "13:20", "very real they say to Eddie Bravo in", "13:22", "here immediately okay here here we go so", "13:27", "this is it from his cell this is inside", "13:29", "there", "13:29", "please up on the screen so this was the", "13:32", "cell he was in by himself okay I said he", "13:34", "used a bunch of these orange jumpsuits", "13:35", "which I guess are already in there he", "13:37", "tied them around his head I guess", "13:39", "there's a there is a little like spot", "13:41", "way up here on the top of the crate", "13:44", "where the window is where you could see", "13:46", "maybe there was something up there but", "13:48", "the thing to remember here is that he", "13:50", "was about six foot tall 185 pounds", "13:52", "there's one other thing like on this", "13:55", "ladder here there is also some other", "13:57", "things I'll get into in just a second", "13:59", "that would be easier to use than tying", "14:01", "all this shit together", "14:02", "but this showed there's the other thing", "14:04", "here was this this was about four feet", "14:06", "off the ground and they do show a noose", "14:09", "which

"just playing news oh that's dr. Michael", "14:19", "badan that's that guy from the HBO", "14:21", "autopsy show for some reason I can't", "14:23", "I'll find it in a second but the picture", "14:24", "that shows his actual neck doesn't seem", "14:27", "like this noose caused that wound and", "14:30", "it's a little bit lower than it probably", "14:31", "should have been oh Jesus", "14:33", "so they're showing some of these

and", "14:52", "maybe like one bone break and sometimes", "14:55", "two but there were three fractures he", "14:57", "says like he's almost never seen that in", "14:59", "any of his cases he's ever looked over", "15:01", "hmm and you would think it would be if", "15:04", "you're gonna hang yourself from such a", "15:06", "short distance it would be even harder", "15:09", "to get a fracture like that right cuz", "15:11", "you're not like jumping out like in an", "15:12", "old western movie like Clint Eastwood", "15:14", "movie when they would hang them hang", "15:15", "them high so the one
