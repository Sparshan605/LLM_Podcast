that this is", "10:18", "something that I read about Canada at", "10:20", "least in Canada the polar bear", "10:22", "population is higher than it's been in", "10:23", "years now", "10:24", "there's there's not a shortage of polar", "10:26", "bears but if you go over there to like", "10:29", "they have hunts for polar bears like", "10:31", "they pay people to take them on polar", "10:33", "bear

and and and but", "10:59", "the problem is in part it's like both", "11:01", "sides they latch on to one piece of", "11:03", "information right so like what you just", "11:05", "said you know the polar bear privatized", "11:06", "to grow so you know that one side will", "11:08", "latch on and say see there's no such", "11:10", "thing as climate change and the other", "11:11", "side will find one piece of him and", "11:12", "they'll latch on to that and then okay", "11:14", "and like I said I'm a big believer that", "11:16", "somewhere in the middle is where most of", "11:18", "the truth

think it's right and I", "19:50", "think part of it is is also we have", "19:52", "gotten to a point where you can't not", "19:55", "know how you you walk it back but you", "19:57", "you you can't

ton of different things that", "22:08", "we're doing that are huge issues but", "22:10", "instead you hear about climate change", "22:12", "and it becomes this ideological left", "22:14", "versus right battle which is it's just", "22:16", "very weird to me and I understand that", "22:18", "climate change is a real issue and if", "22:20", "the ocean water continues to rise", "22:22", "coastal cities really are fucked and if", "22:25", "the temperature does rise we really", "22:27", "might have to migrate to more and you", "22:29", "know better climates but there's a lot", "22:32", "of other shit going on it seems to get", "22:34", "ignored during this process they just", "22:36", "say I mean I you know I'd love to", "22:37", "remember when plastics that was an issue", "22:40", "right plastic bags or or you know", "22:44", "keeping the oceans clean or you know", "22:46", "don't be a little bug I mean it was more", "22:48", "of a it was things that you could", "22:51",

gone", "23:10", "past that now and so now that's not good", "23:13", "enough because you know now we've got to", "23:15", "save the planet", "23:16", "well you save the planet these little", "23:18",

"23:25", "if you if you bring it back down to", "23:27", "those little things like you would you", "23:29", "know maybe implying then I think we're", "23:32", "better off you know right and eventually", "23:33", "you you do make a difference", "23:36", "but if all you do is talk about climate", "23:38", "change and save the planet people just", "23:40", "get overwhelmed it's like a lot of other", "23:41", "things in life and you just think fuck", "23:43", "it I'm just gonna focus on other shit", "23:44", "but it's just so strange that climate", "23:46", "change has become this weird

hemp as a", "24:48", "commodity by demonizing this thing that", "24:52", "they called marijuana which didn't even", "24:53", "it wasn't even the name of cannabis at", "24:56", "the time the marijuana was a name for a", "24:58", "wild Mexican tobacco they applied that", "25:01", "name to cannabis to say that there's", "25:03", "this new drug that's making Mexicans and", "25:05", "blacks rape white

American", "27:19", "public 13 years or 12 years 12 years", "27:22", "after Kennedy's assassination and then I", "27:25", "went and read that paper the articles", "27:28", "that was printed a couple of weeks ago", "27:29", "that you even tweeted about it about the", "27:32", "CIA questioning the official story of", "27:34", "the JFK assassination yeah that was", "27:37", "interesting wasn't it yeah the CIA guy", "27:40", "what do you think about that well first", "27:41", "of all that's a pruder film that's the", "27:43", "most watched piece of film in history of", "27:45", "film has a room which is really", "27:46", "interesting but yeah it was interesting", "27:49", "that the you know as typical with a lot", "27:53", "of these things that the headline", "27:54", "doesn't necessarily actually match once", "27:56", "you get into the body of the story but", "27:57", "the idea being that the agency had some", "28:02", "concerns over the idea that perhaps Cuba", "28:08", "was behind the assassination or the", "28:11", "Russians to some degree or some more", "28:13", "likely in a combination of the two look", "28:16", "I think you know I do I think that that", "28:20", "he could have taken that shot yeah it", "28:23", "was not yeah it was not I said I've been", "28:25", "up in that book depository from that", "28:27", "point of that vantage point we did a", "28:29", "story on the on the whole issue the", "28:32", "conspiracy theory and and what could", "28:33", "have happened then we tried to find some", "28:34", "new witnesses and you know could he have", "28:36", "made that shot", "28:37", "that was a that was it was it straight", "28:38", "forward you know effort was someone who", "28:40", "had some training he was you know he", "28:42", "wasn't the world's best shot but he had", "28:43", "sufficient training to make that shot no", "28:45", "that's separate from you know his", "28:48", "motivations and any potential support", "28:51", "that he may have gotten during the", "28:53", "course of that and you know I think that", "28:56", "he in his mind he he genuinely felt that", "29:00", "this was going to get him into the", "29:02", "revolution right that this was gonna he", "29:03", "had a very unhappy experience in Russia", "29:05", "when he was over there living came back", "29:07", "saw what was happening in Cuba", "29:10", "desperately wanted to be part of that", "29:12", "took a unexplained trip down in Mexico", "29:16", "which could well have been in an effort", "29:19", "to find somebody who could support his", "29:22", "his desire to take some sort of action", "29:25", "whether he had formed in his mind that's", "29:26", "what he was going to do at the time or", "29:28", "not so you know is there still a", "29:31", "possibility that the Cubans which were", "29:34", "the Intel service there would have had", "29:35", "the file on him he was a very very well", "29:39", "known quantity obviously by that time", "29:40", "for the Russians the Russians were", "29:42", "solely responsible for training up the", "29:44", "Cuban Intel service so there's a massive", "29:47", "file on him and they knew you know who", "29:50", "they were dealing with they knew his", "29:51", "weaknesses they knew his they knew his", "29:55", "motivations they knew what to do in", "29:58", "terms of trying to get leverageable you", "30:00", "know information on him so I think that", "30:03", "the jury's still out", "30:05", "I'm not and I'm not a conspiracy guy but", "30:08", "I think there's enough there that says", "30:11", "you know yes it's kind of like what", "30:14", "we're talking about climate change I", "30:15", "believe this but this is all this also", "30:16", "could be true right I think he could", "30:18", "have taken that shot and for sure", "30:20", "and and and and succeeded I think it's", "30:23", "also possible that he may have had the", "30:27", "encouragement of in particular the Cuban", "30:29", "Intel service through the Russians there", "30:32", "because at that time in particular they", "30:34", "didn't do anything the Cubans didn't do", "30:35", "anything without the Russians support", "30:37", "blessings and direction so that is", "30:40", "entirely possible do I think that there", "30:44", "were a variety of other things at play", "30:45", "you know was did they help him get the", "30:50", "the weapon did they I mean you know was", "30:52", "there actual logistical support in there", "30:54", "I don't know I don't think so but maybe", "30:56", "I maybe yeah it's it's it's a", "30:58", "fascinating thing and you know again", "30:59", "nobody wants to think that's something", "31:01", "that impactful could have been just one", "31:06", "guy who you know had a dream about being",

I", "31:17", "will say the one thing that I think", "31:19", "there was something else too was the MLK", "31:21", "issue of Martin Luther King", "31:23", "assassination well let's get to that for", "31:25", "sure but here's the thing about the the", "31:27", "Lee Harvey Oswald assassination you know", "31:29", "a lot of people think that there was", "31:30", "people in the grassy knoll and that they", "31:33", "shot at the president there was more", "31:34", "than one shooter and that's possible too", "31:37", "and here's the other problem with people", "31:38", "saying that Oswald could

conversation about this and it is", "40:26", "somebody who has no shooting experience", "40:29", "or you know it's just you think all", "40:31", "right that's fine I understand why", "40:33", "you're fascinated by it but do when you", "40:35", "do your research you know it's it's like", "40:37", "with news read everything right read The", "40:40", "Wall Street Journal read the New York", "40:41", "Times read the Financial Times read read", "40:43", "The Economist but read everything yes", "40:45", "before you form your opinion right and", "40:47", "and and everybody's so siloed nowadays", "40:49", "and you get the same thing with", "40:50", "conspiracy theories I absolutely believe", "40:52", "this and I'm not gonna I'm gonna", "40:53", "discount everything else that's out", "40:55", "there yeah and or just not pay any", "40:57", "attention to it yeah but it's hard to", "41:00", "say and here's another thing the magic", "41:02", "bullet path people like well how is that", "41:04", "possible", "41:05", "well let me tell you something that's", "41:07", "the most believable thing about the", "41:08", "magic bullet there is the path of the", "41:10", "bullet because bullets do wacky shit", "41:12", "when they hit bone and you can't predict", "41:14", "it at all I know a guy who in Iraq they", "41:18", "shot a guy in the head from the front", "41:21", "and it went out his eyeball the bullet", "41:23", "came out of his eyeball back forward", "41:25", "he ricocheted inside of his skull and", "41:28", "came out his eye you can't I mean again", "41:30", "you can't put your right you can't", "41:31", "protect it they'll try to model these", "41:33", "things and figure out it but you know", "41:35", "there's an unknown there and so yeah I", "41:37", "agree I mean I think that again it's", "41:39", "it's one of those things were it it's", "41:42", "never going to get resolved and it it's", "41:44", "gonna continue to live on because a it", "41:47", "was such an important event and right in", "41:49", "in the history of the country and be it", "41:52", "I keep coming back to that same thing", "41:53", "people don't want to believe that really", "41:55", "awful shit can happen sometimes in a", "41:58", "very simple straightforward way and so", "42:00", "it's much easier to think it was a", "42:02", "broad-based conspiracy there were lots", "42:04", "of moving parts sometimes bad shit", "42:07", "happens and it's just as simple as it", "42:08", "seems that is possible conversely people", "42:10", "don't like to believe in conspiracies", "42:12", "especially when it involves an", "42:13", "assassination of the president right you", "42:15", "know the reason why they came up with", "42:17", "the whole Magic Bullet theory in the", "42:19", "first place is pretty shady in the first", "42:20", "in fact the reason why they did is", "42:22", "because the guy got hit by a ricochet", "42:24", "underneath the overpass and they blamed", "42:26", "that bullet on one of the one of the", "42:29", "shots from Lee Harvey Oswald in the Book", "42:31", "Depository so they said well alright so", "42:33", "now we have less bullets that could have", "42:36", "hit Kennedy we have all these wounds and", "42:38", "we have to tribute a series of wounds to", "42:40", "one bullet right right so that was the", "42:42", "the thought process behind it but this", "42:44", "is a pruder film was the one that got", "42:46", "people weirded out by it but I tell you", "42:48", "about man I've watched that film a bunch", "42:50", "of times and one of the things that", "42:52", "don't jive is if he did get hit from the", "42:54", "front you know his head goes back to", "42:55", "left why is the blood spray out forward", "42:58", "see it's it's it's weird the way the", "43:01", "impact of the blood is they it's like", "43:03", "the blood sprays forward and then his", "43:05", "head goes back into the left he could", "43:07", "have possibly been that he was hit from", "43:09", "the front and the back at the same time", "43:10", "that's entirely possible I mean that is", "43:13", "a tactic you would do right you would", "43:15", "roll someone into an area where they", "43:17", "would be in a crossfire and they would", "43:18", "get shot well if they came in if there", "43:21", "was if the grassy knoll was in fact a", "43:22", "second sight for a shooter then by the", "43:27", "time it hits that corner and starts its", "43:29", "path just before the shots were fired", "43:32", "from the Book Depository and Oswald if", "43:34", "you're going with that if you had an", "43:37", "another shooter up on the grass you know", "43:38", "you're you are basically looking right", "43:43", "at the the the front of the radical and", "43:47", "because of the way that it its position", "43:49", "in the knoll is kind of turned and then", "43:50", "it's just that it's just that there's", "43:56", "not a lot of concealment up there right", "43:59", "and they had that they had the defense", "44:01", "the picket fence it's not the original", "44:02", "one that's there anymore but it's", "44:03", "basically in line with it and you can", "44:05", "there's plenty of pictures of the", "44:06", "Oh previous offense that was up there at", "44:09", "the time and you had that yeah you did", "44:13", "have the train yard engineer report",

you", "44:24", "know that was", "44:25", "that's an interesting thread to pull on", "44:27", "right and I think that that it's been", "44:29", "you know it's been researched ad nauseam", "44:32", "doesn't mean you couldn't still find", "44:34", "something it also doesn't mean anybody's", "44:36", "gonna really find a conclusion after the", "44:38", "fact right especially today ya know and",

there and so they put", "71:22", "in the effort you are happy playing and", "71:25", "you could you could be there but you're", "71:27", "not doing it yet right and so therefore", "71:29", "you you know hey don't get down on", "71:31", "yourself but be don't certainly don't", "71:33", "get down on anybody else", "71:34", "because they put out the effort and they", "71:36", "accomplished something that you didn't", "71:38", "write so I mean it's it you know you're", "71:40", "always trying to find that balance it's", "71:42", "just I don't think we're not doing our", "71:43", "kids any favors right now I just think", "71:45", "we're not not obviously as a broad-brush", "71:47", "statement but in general terms I think", "71:50", "society is not doing us any favors we're", "71:55", "and you see that I'm a daughter that's", "71:57", "in college and she talks about her you", "71:59", "know her classmates and others and and", "72:01", "you know sort of the conversations they", "72:04", "have in class and and the discussions", "72:05", "and what passes is debate nowadays which", "72:07", "is not much right the idea of the old", "72:10", "debate where you can you can voice your", "72:12", "opinions and they can be different than", "72:13", "somebody else's and you can you know", "72:15", "hash it out and you can have a winner", "72:16", "and a loser but that's

because everybody's", "72:25", "so afraid of saying something that might", "72:27", "be offensive or not offensive but just", "72:29", "might be upsetting and there's a", "72:32", "difference between being upsetting and", "72:33", "being offensive we're trying to nerf the", "72:35", "world I mean that really was what we're", "72:37", "trying to all the hard edges that you", "72:40", "might bruise yourself on we're trying to", "72:41", "push it put a cushion but you need to", "72:43", "understand that when you fall down it's", "72:44", "gonna hurt so that way next time you're", "72:47", "thinking you might fall down you'll", "72:48", "correct your path yeah it's the whole", "72:50", "reason why people do difficult things", "72:52", "you do difficult things to understand", "72:54",

whatever limitations of your", "73:04", "abilities learn from whatever those are", "73:06", "and improve the SEC interrogation", "73:08", "training you in interrogation training", "73:10", "when you're working with people the goal", "73:13", "is to show them that it's okay at some", "73:15", "point they're gonna have to talk right", "73:17", "and so when you're going through the", "73:20", "training the point of it is to get them", "73:22", "to that point they realize that okay you", "73:25", "know it's not the end of the world", "73:26", "I know that at some point I'm gonna end", "73:28", "up talking I'm gonna say something I'm", "73:30", "gonna have to do that because I can't", "73:31", "otherwise I'm either dead or I'm", "73:33", "completely broken and the idea is if you", "73:35", "you do that and then the rest of the", "73:37", "training and beyond that you're building", "73:39", "them back up because they understand", "73:40", "that now if God forbid something should", "73:42", "happen they get picked up and there's", "73:43", "actually an interrogation going on in", "73:45", "the back of their mind they understand", "73:46", "that and they're able to process it so", "73:49", "that if they do get to that point where", "73:51", "now okay I'm gonna have to talk I'm have", "73:53", "to come up with something it's gonna and", "73:55", "then it's not completely devastating it", "73:57", "doesn't you know leave them completely", "73:59", "broken and they can come walk back", "74:00", "because they understand I got to that", "74:02", "point I understand what my boundaries", "74:03", "are but I can work within that I don't", "74:06", "know where I'm going with this other but", "74:07", "you seen are you seeing interrogation", "74:09", "training like an agent gets interrogate", "74:11", "yeah yeah I mean interrogation training", "74:12", "in general for you know for our outfit", "74:15", "for the military you know it's it's", "74:16", "basically the same we do it across", "74:18", "different this is not interrogating an", "74:20", "enemy combatant know you being you know", "74:23", "going through interrogation training is", "74:25", "what do you tell them to do like and", "74:26", "that's it's like say if someone gets", "74:28", "captured in Afghanistan or whatever well", "74:31", "I mean yeah bottom line is you know you", "74:33", "you try to avoid talking right but it", "74:36", "depends part of it is you got to assess", "74:38", "who you're dealing with right you got to", "74:40", "assess what you think their parameters", "74:41", "are what could be coming down the pike", "74:43", "in other words right so how is this and", "74:45", "that's part of the training too is", "74:46", "understanding what different groups what", "74:48", "different places could could mean what", "74:51", "would that what that interrogation could", "74:52", "look like how bad it could get so you're", "74:55", "processing that part of it is", "74:56", "understanding what it is that it's okay", "74:58", "to give up what are you what are you", "75:00", "going to say that's not going to put", "75:01", "anything in jeopardy anybody's lives or", "75:03", "any operations are in jeopardy", "75:04", "part of it is you you know you've then", "75:06", "you've got to understand you got to stay", "75:08", "close to the truth", "75:09", "the problem with it if you you know", "75:12", "where you start getting people out on", "75:14", "interrogations is where they can't", "75:15", "remember what they've said right the", "75:18", "closer you are to the truth the easier", "75:19", "it is to remember what you've said right", "75:21", "so and these things I mean if it's a bad", "75:24", "situation and you're in there day in and", "75:26", "day out you know and you're sleep", "75:29", "deprivation and they're you know", "75:30", "knocking you around and there's no food", "75:32", "and that's you're gonna have it you're", "75:33", "gonna have a hard time keeping track of", "75:35", "even the basic things so you you know", "75:37", "you're trying to keep it as close to the", "75:38", "truth as possible and as minimal as", "75:40", "possible you know in terms of damage you", "75:42", "go and you know I mean typically you you", "75:45", "you've thought through all of this it's", "75:46", "like everything else you do your", "75:47", "homework ahead of time and God forbid", "75:49", "something should happen and you know", "75:50", "usually it won't but anyway the point", "75:52", "being is that you know the idea is in", "75:55", "the training portion of it you want", "75:57", "people to understand that you know", "75:58", "everybody's got a breaking point all", "76:00", "right and that's just that's the way it", "76:02", "works in someone's some it's you know", "76:04", "it's here some it's further down the", "76:06", "road but everybody's gonna break and you", "76:09", "don't want that devastate the person if", "76:12", "it should happen you know knock on wood", "76:13", "but anyway that was apropos of nothing", "76:16", "no it's it's important I mean it's it's", "76:19", "an interesting topic because I mean", "76:23", "understanding that there's going to be", "76:25", "severe penalties and that there's going", "76:27", "to be repercussions yeah they're you", "76:30", "know the this is a this is a bad", "76:31", "situation you're in and understanding", "76:33", "that going in is gonna help you a lot", "76:36", "more than if you go in there from you", "76:38", "know soft hatted world where you don't", "76:41", "think there's gonna be any adversity", "76:42", "whatsoever no that's right and and", "76:43", "that's all we're you know just to finish", "76:47", "that thought is it the interesting thing", "76:50", "about people talked about the", "76:52", "interrogation program that we had", "76:53", "obviously right and anyway I don't want", "76:55", "to revisit that and you know that the", "76:56", "left did a very fine job of grabbing the", "76:58", "moral high ground and saying that you're", "76:59", "talking to people or it's all torture", "77:01", "mmm right but the point being is that", "77:04", "even if you don't ever intend to use any", "77:08", "enhanced interrogation techniques you", "77:12", "don't want to tell the enemy that", "77:14", "because once you tell them that you're", "77:19", "constrained by the Army Field Manual as", "77:22", "an example that's", "77:23", "all you can do guess what every Mook out", "77:26", "there fighting us and wanting to harm us", "77:28", "is carrying a copy the Army Field Manual", "77:30", "you know that's right despite the fact", "77:33", "that they did for a while they don't", "77:34", "live in a cave right and so once they", "77:36", "know what's coming down the pike that's", "77:39", "gone their incentive is gone right to", "77:42", "talk to you because they once you know", "77:44", "once you don't have that unknown if", "77:46", "you're not sitting in some you know", "77:48", "squat box and the temperatures you know", "77:50", "up and you're haven't eaten then you're", "77:52", "thinking what the hell they gonna do to", "77:53", "me next you have no idea if that's gone", "77:57", "and you don't have that anxiety that in", "77:59", "you know intense anxiety then you're", "78:01", "okay right", "78:02", "mentally you get yourself to a nice", "78:04", "happy spot you're comfortable they're", "78:05", "feeding you they're just asking", "78:06", "questions they're just asking questions", "78:08", "and you're you know you can you can hold", "78:10", "out for a much longer period of time and", "78:12", "yeah maybe there'll be some clever you", "78:14", "know person working the interrogation", "78:15", "facility they'll develop a personal", "78:17", "relationship over a period of time you", "78:18", "know but you know what by then your", "78:20", "operational information is lost its", "78:22", "interest right and it's shelf life and", "78:24", "that stuff is not particularly long", "78:27", "typically so anyway that's yeah when you", "78:31", "put when you're in a situation where you", "78:33", "have to extract information in a very", "78:35", "short period of time because it's", "78:36", "critical because lives are at stake", "78:38",

"78:45", "terrorist attack beam land you know this", "78:48", "guy asked some information what is the", "78:50", "best way to get it out of them is there", "78:52", "a best way there's you know what it's", "78:54", "not really because it's all dependent on", "78:55", "the individual and that's where it's so", "78:57", "much of this and you know they it just I", "78:59", "Ganic that the argument got sort of you", "79:02", "know corrupted hijacked whatever because", "79:04", "of waterboarding because yeah it just", "79:06", "became such an emotive issue but it's an", "79:10", "enormous labor

themselves in ya", "101:20", "know it's it's it yeah but the idea that", "101:23", "you write the idea that you'd remove law", "101:24", "enforcement and somehow we're all gonna", "101:26", "live in a

Afghanistan and", "101:56", "that yeah yeah Trump was gonna make some", "102:00", "sort of an announcement and you were", "102:02", "talking about the idea of privatizing", "102:05", "the the military over there and you know", "102:07", "bringing in you know contractors talking", "102:10", "about from the point of view that I", "102:11", "don't agree with that yeah and that's", "102:13", "and I you know I yeah in terms of", "102:16", "disclosure right I mean my company", "102:17", "diligence we got a security services", "102:19", "group and starting back in 2003 we", "102:22", "started building up a fairly significant", "102:24", "presence out in Iraq right as private", "102:27", "contractors providing support to the", "102:30", "infrastructure operations that were", "102:31", "going on out there and what's the", "102:32", "benefit of having a private contractor", "102:34", "for the military as opposed to like", "102:37", "without air force at that time most of", "102:38", "our work was actually for the", "102:40", "infrastructure companies right because", "102:42", "the military is not gonna write", "102:43", "providing support they need security and", "102:45", "if al Burton is building up some sort of", "102:47", "a new business there they would hire you", "102:49", "guys to come in exactly and so that's an", "102:51", "important effort because you know they", "102:53", "need the same level of security that a", "102:55", "Forward Operating Base or a military", "102:56", "base or facility would need you know but", "102:59", "the military is not going to allocate", "103:00", "resources for private companies so a lot", "103:02", "of the what the private contractors were", "103:04", "doing was that and then also private", "103:05", "contractors you know getting contracts", "103:07", "to provide additional security support", "103:10", "or logistical support to the military to", "103:13", "military facilities where they can't you", "103:16", "know they can't afford the allocate", "103:18", "resources to perimeter security and to", "103:20", "the degree that they would like so", "103:21", "private contractors come in and help", "103:23", "with that or providing support in the", "103:25", "movement of dignitaries or whatever may", "103:27", "be point being as we were out there for", "103:29", "quite some time in Iraq doing that and", "103:32", "we were there at the beginning of sort", "103:34", "of this private contractor thing right", "103:36", "and people start becoming aware of it", "103:38", "and we started working with groups", "103:39", "including Eric Prince's group we didn't", "103:43", "work directly with them but what I mean", "103:44", "is the various groups are out there", "103:46", "doing these contracts and this work you", "103:48", "know realizing they needed to start to", "103:49", "form an association or started to get", "103:51", "some sort of you know", "103:53", "grip on how this thing would look right", "103:55", "so that there was some consistency", "103:57", "amongst training and what were the", "103:58", "regulations for you know the various", "104:01", "companies for you know weapons and", "104:03", "everything else it's complicated but you", "104:05", "know long story short it's you know we", "104:07", "had upwards a 400 people I guess out", "104:08", "there at a point providing security and", "104:11", "intelligence support so I've got some", "104:13", "experience in this and now what's", "104:15", "happening with Afghanistan is that one", "104:19", "of the options that's been being", "104:21", "considered is is handing over we got", "104:24", "about eighty four hundred troops out", "104:26", "there right now doing mostly training", "104:27", "missions training operations and support", "104:29", "for the Afghan troops so the idea was", "104:32", "well let's let the private contractor", "104:34", "take that over let's let's move that out", "104:37", "and let's not have the brave men and", "104:38", "women of the US military engaged in", "104:41", "Afghanistan ad nauseam you know and this", "104:43", "idea is being pushed to some degree by", "104:45", "our Prince you know and he's you know", "104:47", "said things like well you know if you", "104:49", "you know if you want to keep having this", "104:51", "conversation you want to have the", "104:52", "conversation ten years from now fine", "104:53", "let's the military keep doing it you", "104:54", "know or we can be more you know somehow", "104:57", "efficient they explain that people who", "104:59", "Erick Prince's from blah I'm sorry yeah", "105:02", "it came out of a wealthy Michigan based", "105:05", "family Betsy DeVos the care the", "105:07", "education secretary is his sister in the", "105:09", "current administration and so he started", "105:12", "Blackwater and you know they they they", "105:14", "became sort of the face of right because", "105:16", "they they did very well it's a private", "105:18", "contractor business they got good", "105:19", "contract and that was good they had some", "105:21", "issues and some problems a very", "105:23", "controversial very controversial they", "105:24", "sold the business renamed it then", "105:26", "renamed it again and yada yada but the", "105:28", "point being is that the idea that", "105:30", "somehow you're gonna privatize this", "105:32", "operation in Afghanistan expecting then", "105:34", "if you here's a thing he cuz he said", "105:37", "well it'd be about ten billion dollars a", "105:38", "year which would be a savings on what we", "105:40", "spend now you give private contractors", "105:43", "you know a ten billion dollar trough to", "105:46", "eat at you think they're gonna end it", "105:47", "anytime soon it's no fucking way", "105:50", "so if we want this thing to just drag on", "105:52", "ad nauseam fine privatize it and put", "105:55", "that profit motive up there and you", "105:57", "think somehow it's not gonna happen and", "105:58", "I cannot say that as a private", "106:01", "contractor in you know it's been", "106:02", "involved it why I appreciate your", "106:03", "honesty now you know I just it's just", "106:05", "it's the wrong", "106:06", "thing to do and if and and on top of", "106:08", "that if work and I guess the the", "106:10", "overlying the the 30,000 foot view that", "106:14", "I've got is that if it's important", "106:16", "enough for us to be there then that's a", "106:18", "military function that's that's then we", "106:21", "have to commit in a way that you know", "106:23", "we're not right now we've been in this", "106:25", "sort of stalemate situation right over", "106:27", "there and now we're somewhat surprised", "106:30", "or people are surprised that the Taliban", "106:31", "is resurgent well where the hell did", "106:34", "they think they were gonna go there's", "106:36", "the Taliban don't have any place to go", "106:38", "so they're gonna wait us out this was", "106:41", "entirely predictable that some and we're", "106:44", "trying to sell them the pseudo federal", "106:46", "democracy you know the Afghan people", "106:48", "don't understand for the most part I", "106:50", "don't think maybe I'm just too cynical", "106:51", "but they don't understand what the hell", "106:52", "we've been trying to sell them for all", "106:53", "these years so this doesn't diminish all", "106:56", "the pain and sacrifice and suffering of", "106:58", "all people that have been out there and", "107:00", "the lives that we've lost it doesn't", "107:02", "diminish it at all what I'm saying is", "107:03", "that we need to think about what's our", "107:05", "what's our endgame what's our objective", "107:07", "so if if we're worried now about the", "107:09", "Taliban resurging and Isis you know kind", "107:12", "of coming back in well fine but let's", "107:14", "let's say this is our objective and to", "107:16", "meet that objective then we're going to", "107:18", "need more troops on the ground and let's", "107:20", "see how that plays out I don't think a", "107:21", "lot of people are gonna be happy about", "107:22", "it you don't necessarily do things to", "107:24", "make people happy if it's a national", "107:25", "security interest if we decide that", "107:27", "that's in our national security interest", "107:29", "then yes we need to commit and do it but", "107:31", "handing it over to a privatized you know", "107:34", "force to me is is is just slightly left", "107:38", "of insane it doesn't make any sense", "107:40", "and you know it's always easy for people", "107:43", "to stand around and talk tough and say", "107:44", "we just need more troops yeah well I", "107:47", "don't know that the objective is", "107:50", "sufficiently clarified to say that we", "107:52", "need more troops I haven't heard I don't", "107:54", "care whether we improve the literacy", "107:56", "rate of the Afghan people by another", "107:57", "percentage point or if we build another", "107:59", "Road I don't think that's in our", "108:01", "national security interests and so I", "108:03", "think we need to be a little bit more", "108:04", "clear about why we're there or what", "108:06", "we're hoping to accomplish at some point", "108:07", "we wanted to be there so that we they", "108:09", "wouldn't use it as a playground for", "108:10", "terrorists who then develop and plot and", "108:13", "plan and attack the west again so maybe", "108:16", "the thing that we should have done was", "108:18", "go in there kicked", "108:19", "shit out of them like we did in Tora", "108:21", "Bora and elsewhere explain to the", "108:23", "remnants of the government if you allow", "108:25", "that to happen again we're gonna come", "108:26", "back and we do this again and we're very", "108:28", "good at that we're very good at", "108:29", "strategic operations and we could have", "108:31", "done that and maybe that's the thing we", "108:33", "need to do now and then that", "108:34", "government's been corrupted for a very", "108:36", "long time Karzai government holy shit", "108:38", "they were completely corrupt and yet we", "108:40", "all rallied around Karzai as if he was", "108:42", "you know because he dressed well my", "108:44", "mother was a heroine yes", "108:48", "you know in the current government is it", "108:50", "any better well if they're a little more", "108:51", "clever at hiding their corruption but it", "108:53", "still exists and more importantly the", "108:55", "tribal society there doesn't really get", "108:57", "this idea of you know a strong central", "109:00", "government you know it kind of runs", "109:01", "counter to thousands of years of", "109:04", "self-governance out there but anyway so", "109:07", "that's that's the thing so what's he", "109:08", "gonna say tonight I don't have a clue", "109:09", "but I think he does he's got limited", "109:11", "opera what's gonna say we're gonna cut", "109:13", "and run we're gonna leave that's one", "109:14", "option we're going to increase the", "109:16", "number of US troops on the ground that's", "109:18", "one option is right there it's up Trump", "109:21", "proposed down 4,000 more troops to", "109:23", "Afghanistan is that it is that good now", "109:25", "here's the thing about when it comes to", "109:27", "operations over there and what are what", "109:29", "the objectives are one of the things", "109:31", "that I've been hearing from people that", "109:32", "are in the military that I know is they", "109:34", "say they are happy that Trump is", "109:37", "supporting them and that Trump is kind", "109:39", "of essentially giving the reins to the", "109:40", "military saying look this is what you", "109:42", "guys do I'm not gonna get in your way in", "109:44", "fact I'm gonna support you and there", "109:46", "seem to be one of the few groups that is", "109:48", "fairly universally happy with his", "109:51", "decisions in that regard and people that", "109:53", "he's appointed I think that's right I", "109:54", "think law enforcement as well I think is", "109:55", "if you feel like you've got top cover", "109:58", "right you know then you know that was", "110:00", "one of the problems many people talked", "110:01", "about the and we talked about it briefly", "110:02", "about the idea of the you know sort of", "110:04", "the narrative of sort of a battle", "110:06", "between Trump and the Intel community", "110:07", "yeah it took immunity had a problem with", "110:09", "the previous administration because they", "110:12", "kept shifting the goalposts they were", "110:13", "going to criminally prosecute people in", "110:15", "the agency for

it's like Vietnam", "115:25", "what would you do", "115:26", "where did the Vietcong have to go they", "115:27", "had nowhere to go right right it's a", "115:29", "totally different situation though isn't", "115:30", "it because the Vietcong really didn't", "115:32", "have any threat to us well what I mean", "115:34", "is what did we think was gonna happen", "115:35", "right they were gonna outweigh us they", "115:37", "were going to help lastest they were", "115:38", "gonna say that the suffering was nothing", "115:40", "in their mind where I impaired to what", "115:42", "we were going through and how we were", "115:43", "processing and so I guess that's what I", "115:45", "mean that you can't yeah everything is", "115:47", "it's relative but I mean with this what", "115:50", "would you do", "115:50", "well I if you were in the situation to", "115:53", "call the shots like someone said hey", "115:54", "Mike Baker what do we do about", "115:56", "Afghanistan yeah you know what it's it's", "116:00", "it's I'm not saying it's an easy by any", "116:03", "means it's a it's above my pay grade but", "116:06", "B I think Isis creates a different", "116:10", "situation there if we hadn't seen Isis", "116:14", "develop and start to impact to some", "116:17", "degree things that are going on in", "116:18", "Afghanistan then I think we could be", "116:21", "better off just saying okay we're gonna", "116:23", "figure out a way to work with the", "116:25", "Taliban I mean the Taliban I think at", "116:28", "this stage of the game could be", "116:30", "contained within Afghanistan without", "116:31", "allowing their place to be used as a", "116:34", "shelter for terrorism I say that now", "116:37", "caveat I'm saying now you've got Isis", "116:39", "and that's a different kettle of fish", "116:40", "because they're at odds with each other", "116:42", "so what are we gonna do end up you know", "116:44", "in some weird fashion supporting the", "116:46", "Taliban and their efforts to you know", "116:48", "stamp out Isis right I I don't know it's", "116:51", "it's a that gets real weird yeah this is", "116:54", "what you were talking thousands of years", "116:56", "of history of failed efforts in", "116:58", "Afghanistan and do I think do I have the", "117:01", "hubris to think that we somehow are", "117:02", "going to solve this no so you know maybe", "117:06", "maybe the answer is just find that point", "117:09", "on the curve where you can support an", "117:12", "existing government that you can hold", "117:13", "your nose and live", "117:14", "with its you know that it's corrupt and", "117:17", "you know but at least they're working in", "117:20", "the counterterrorism realm you know and", "117:22", "they're there supporting those sort of", "117:24", "interests from our perspective and yet", "117:27", "you know I don't think we're ever gonna", "117:28", "get to that point where we see a stable", "117:31", "self-supporting you know pseudo", "117:33", "democratic nation exist there I just", "117:35", "don't think it's gonna happen so that's", "117:37", "a hugely unsatisfying answer but you", "117:41", "know maybe it's maybe it's like", "117:43", "pollution you do little things you know", "117:45", "and hope that it helps and maybe that's", "117:47", "what we're doing here you know if you", "117:48", "just start from the point if you were", "117:49", "saying we're gonna create a bulwark of", "117:51", "democracy", "117:51", "yeah overwhelmed it's never gonna happen", "117:53", "so you don't do anything you background", "117:55", "I part of me just I hate the idea of", "117:58", "leaving right I think a lot of people do", "118:00", "who they think we're gonna create a", "118:03", "vacuum right right and and quite frankly", "118:05", "that's typically what happens you know", "118:06", "in particularly with Isis you know when", "118:08", "a president said they would see that and", "118:10", "they would see an opportunity now you", "118:12", "know they've they're at odds with the", "118:13", "Taliban and Taliban is pretty brutal", "118:16", "could they handle it on their own you", "118:18", "know meaning could they you know destroy", "118:20", "Isis on their own man who knows maybe", "118:21", "but it's it certainly complicates the", "118:24", "situation but now especially if we just", "118:26", "decide to somehow or another support", "118:28", "Isis now that's never gonna happen", "118:31", "we never know I mean excuse me the", "118:33", "Taliban yeah their battle against Isis I", "118:35", "could see that I could see elements of", "118:39", "the Taliban saying look we just want", "118:41", "fuckin self-govern right okay we get it", "118:44", "I can never imagine a scenario where the", "118:46", "United States would support the Taliban", "118:47", "because they're at war with Isis and", "118:50", "then the Taliban could soften their", "118:51", "stance on some things we reach some sort", "118:53", "of common ground well look we're kind of", "118:55", "on the same side with Iran against Isis", "118:59", "right they're not supporting Iran right", "119:00", "in a way we are in the sense that we're", "119:02", "we're trying to kill the same people", "119:05", "right so who would have thought that you", "119:07", "know four or five years ago so it's", "119:09", "that's how nutty Isis is yeah yeah yeah", "119:12", "everybody can agree everybody could", "119:13", "agree it's a it's the one group that", "119:15", "everybody can agree on but yeah I don't", "119:19", "know it's interesting so that's what the", "119:21", "president's gonna talk about this", "119:22", "evening four thousand more troops I you", "119:25", "know he could have said we're gonna", "119:27", "leave", "119:28", "and the people that hate Trump would be", "119:31", "up in arms you could say we're gonna add", "119:33", "4,000 troops are gonna be up in arms you", "119:34", "could say we're gonna give it over to", "119:35", "the private contractors they'd be up in", "119:36", "arms it doesn't really matter so there's", "119:38", "gonna be a lot of opposition to this", "119:39", "regardless if there's a clear defined", "119:42", "mission with an endgame fine", "119:45", "I just haven't I don't know what that is", "119:47", "you know and maybe they maybe they've", "119:48", "said it I just haven't seen it well it", "119:50", "seems like the only way we're ever gonna", "119:52", "get peace and harmony in the world is if", "119:55", "there's no fifth world fourth world", "119:56", "third world or second world just one", "119:59", "first world everybody has like suburban", "120:02", "problems yeah yeah no I mean no never", "120:06", "society where everybody's on the same", "120:08", "footing impossible maybe I'll have", "120:11", "universal basic income and across the", "120:14", "world", "120:14", "yeah and get rid of law enforcement", "120:17", "exactly", "120:18", "no Iraq everywhere I don't think that's", "120:20", "it yeah it's not gonna happen and and", "120:21", "you know that's so disheartening for", "120:23", "people though to a guy like you as", "120:25", "someone so many years of experience in", "120:29", "intelligence agencies that you would say", "120:32", "that there's nothing that could ever be", "120:34", "done that would give peace in the world", "120:36", "like generations from now which they're", "120:39", "going to be dealing with the same issues", "120:40", "we're dealing I mean maybe you know if", "120:41", "the chemists can figure out a way to get", "120:43", "us all next to see that's gonna solve it", "120:46", "ya know I don't know you know it's it's", "120:48", "the way it is it's human nature and I", "120:51", "you know but I got we have periods of", "120:54", "press you go through periods of", "120:55", "prosperity and and during those periods", "120:57", "it kind of helps to lift everybody up", "120:58", "and they get to a certain level that", "121:00", "they didn't imagine before we're still", "121:02", "trailing but we ever going to get to a", "121:04", "point where we're all you know we're all", "121:07", "the same I don't I mean I hey great but", "121:11", "I don't see it here's the perfect", "121:13", "example the United States and Germany", "121:14", "right we were at war in the 1940s and", "121:17", "now we're absolutely a peace I mean is", "121:19", "and Germany is prosperous and it's a", "121:22", "great country and everything's great I", "121:24", "mean I would wonder what would have to", "121:27", "take place for this to be a worldwide", "121:29", "thing where the the rest of the world", "121:31", "sort of rises up to an adequate level of", "121:34", "civilization and we no longer engage in", "121:37", "the potential global", "121:40", "or that we're all looking at right now", "121:41", "I'm really looking at the possibility", "121:43", "with Russia and with North Korea and all", "121:46", "these different players there could be", "121:47", "some sort of a twisted World War 3 going", "121:50", "on Russia is Russia's punching over its", "121:53", "weight I mean at the end of the day", "121:55", "Russia's got a GDP you know equivalent", "121:57", "to a mid-sized EU country right I mean", "122:00", "so they just you know outen is very", "122:02", "clear he wants to rebuild the Soviet", "122:03", "Union to some degree in some fashion", "122:05", "right and he's been he's done it through", "122:07", "some territory it does it through energy", "122:08", "policy through meddling like they always", "122:11", "do but so I you know I don't like Russia", "122:13", "but to your point yeah as with the US", "122:16", "and Germany could we see a way that the", "122:18", "u.s. and Iran for example could find", "122:20", "common ground and suddenly 40 years from", "122:23", "now be at peace and not only a peace but", "122:25", "supporting each other's economy and you", "122:27", "know have that sort of interaction and I", "122:30", "don't know I don't think so I think so", "122:34", "damn can I pour you some coffee no I'm", "122:36", "good I just think I'm just like it's", "122:38", "just at a certain point in time it just", "122:41", "it's very frustrating to think that I", "122:44", "guess the pace of progress is so", "122:46", "incredibly slow when you look back in", "122:47", "history this is probably the safest time", "122:50", "to be alive ever so there's been some", "122:51", "progress from you know Roman times to", "122:54",

were", "164:01", "satisfied that there was no and we just", "164:03", "okay that was part of the deal so we'll", "164:05", "end that investigation but we don't have", "164:07", "that verification so Trump go to my", "164:09", "point being Trump could just be sitting", "164:10", "in that seat when North Korea gets where", "164:14", "they are when Iran possibly you know cuz", "164:16", "I could happen sooner rather than later", "164:17", "and then yeah then you'd like to think", "164:20", "that the person in that position would", "164:23", "be rational", "164:23", "yes a little more reasoned I read an", "164:26", "article today that's saying that that", "164:28", "him saying all that crazy shit about", "164:30", "fire and fury that the world has ever", "164:32", "seen", "164:32", "might have actually been what he needed", "164:35", "to say when you're dealing with someone", "164:37", "like North Korea and they're the I mean", "164:39", "was obviously an opinion piece right but",

Korea", "165:06", "received them and honestly 20-plus years", "165:10", "of measured diplomatic language and", "165:14", "restrained talk didn't really do", "165:17", "anything it just kicked the can down the", "165:19", "road so yeah maybe maybe a different", "165:23", "approach in a measured fashion but the", "165:25", "problem is because of their sort of the", "165:27", "perceived chaos nobody has the", "165:30", "confidence to believe that he's doing it", "165:31", "in a disciplined reasoned way right so", "165:34", "they don't look at it and go yeah he's", "165:35", "saying that's a message he's sending", "165:36", "Brian they just look out and go he just", "165:38", "you know blasting off another tweet", "165:40", "except scott adams scott adams is the", "165:42", "only one that

plan", "166:46", "and if it was part of the plan he'd like", "166:48", "to think it was you know it was it was", "166:50", "part of a conversation amongst the the", "166:52", "cabinet yeah anyway yeah
