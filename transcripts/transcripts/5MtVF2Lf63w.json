that", "00:09", "people like yourself oftentimes make", "00:12", "really good analysts because like you're", "00:15", "a guy who was like looking at fighting", "00:18", "at whether it's MMA stand up on the", "00:21", "ground whatever it was you're looking at", "00:22", "it at this very analytical level it's", "00:27", "for me it's like asking questions", "00:29", "men's am one of my boxing coach's Kenny", "00:31", "Weldon used to say that when I fought", "00:33", "Aaron the second time he watched the", "00:35", "fight after the fact and he was like I", "00:37", "was like so what do you

all the questions but he has no", "01:01", "answers so he's asking me questions I'm", "01:04", "giving him answers and um I think that's", "01:07", "kind of how I watch fights or how I", "01:09", "fought I would try to do something and", "01:11", "see what you're doing because of that", "01:12", "yeah you know you kind of play with that", "01:14", "and feel it and and that's how I watch",

those", "02:10", "Melvin Manhoef dudes - you", "02:13", "I admire Vandelay like maybe more than", "02:16", "anybody just cuz he was so wild to watch", "02:18", "but I found I find that for analysis", "02:21", "like Dominic Cruz is another guy I think", "02:23", "knocks it out of the park because he's", "02:25", "so he's so smart in his assessment of", "02:29", "risk and reward and putting yourself in", "02:31", "a position where your opponent doesn't", "02:33", "exactly know what you're gonna do but", "02:35", "you know how he's going to react because", "02:37", "you're you have this awkward style that", "02:38", "you've seen other people react to for a", "02:40", "long time but for them it's like this", "02:43", "new thing they're standing in front this", "02:45", "guy who's switching stances and bouncing", "02:47", "and moving up and down and back and", "02:49", "forth and you're not exactly sure what", "02:51", "the fuck he's doing but he knows what", "02:54", "you're gonna do yeah because he's so", "02:55", "used to doing it to regular people like", "02:57", "everybody who stands like you know like", "02:59", "certain guys they have that like Muay", "03:01", "thai-style and god there's so much that", "03:04", "they're giving a guy in that situation", "03:06", "and when you got a guy like Dominick", "03:08", "Cruz like he's not predictable at all", "03:10", "he's like flipping stances and moving", "03:13", "around and throwing punches from these", "03:15", "weird fucking angles where you would", "03:18", "swear he's doing it wrong right yeah", "03:20", "it's for me I always look at the way", "03:23", "someone explains something to me as as", "03:25", "the easiest way to explain it", "03:27", "and that Askren Tyron said Ben likes to", "03:30", "cause scrambles right that's what Dom", "03:33", "does yeah he's causing scrambles on the", "03:35", "feet because he's he's not in a", "03:37", "traditional position he's not he's not", "03:39", "coming at you like everybody else does", "03:40", "so what he's doing is initiating a", "03:43", "scramble right away when you're when you", "03:45", "get a guy on top of you like RDA and", "03:47", "he's good at establishing position if", "03:50", "you can create a scramble then you have", "03:52", "a better chance of getting out then if", "03:53", "you that if you just try to use basic", "03:56", "technique and Dominic is comfortable in", "03:58", "those scrambles he he's been in them so", "04:00", "many times when you react you have like", "04:03", "three or four reactions but he has like", "04:05",

pretty interesting right yeah neo", "05:07", "footwork is what people are calling it", "05:10", "right", "05:10", "it's like TJ Dillashaw style he's got a", "05:13", "very interesting style too and I hit", "05:17", "paths with Dwayne recently Dwayne showed", "05:19", "me some stuff and one of the things he's", "05:21", "doing is all these switch stances he's", "05:23", "doing like these you're switching and", "05:25", "throwing punches as you're switching", "05:27", "he's got a lot of this switch stance", "05:30", "stuff that he's really incorporating", "05:32", "into these combinations and you see it a", "05:34", "lot from TJ I mean TJ is as comfortable", "05:37", "from a southpaw as he is from an", "05:38", "Orthodox and he's doing a lot of these", "05:41", "switch moves like they're they're", "05:42", "hitting pads with these and they're very", "05:44", "confusing you know", "05:47", "so remember when when I said I don't", "05:50", "like that style at Genki sudo style hmm", "05:52", "because not because but Dominick style", "05:56", "that style I think is the style to beat", "05:59", "that the reason I say that is because", "06:01", "the way Dominic is approaching it he's", "06:04", "approaching it from educated I would say", "06:09", "more educated more studious place hmm", "06:13", "these guys are approaching it from", "06:15", "trying to get you to buy the wolf ticket", "06:19", "you know so they're they're giving you", "06:21", "these weird looks because that's gonna", "06:23", "make you get off balance again I'd stand", "06:26", "there for them be the guy that's just", "06:27", "the target but DOM is giving you these", "06:29", "looks from a fighting perspective he's", "06:32", "always in position to fight those guys", "06:35", "when you're when you're breakdancing", "06:36", "sometimes you're not in position to", "06:37", "react DOM is always in position to react", "06:40", "and that's why I think that style is the", "06:43", "style that beats the other style 10 out", "06:45", "of 10 times what's really interesting is", "06:47", "I don't recall anybody before Dominick", "06:50", "Cruz doing it like that", "06:51", "I really don't it it's a lot of what I", "06:55", "mean it's limited but Muhammad Ali did a", "06:58", "lot of things like that with his boxing", "07:00", "you know yeah the rope-a-dope and his", "07:02", "footwork that that's that's a part of it", "07:05", "that's a part of what Dom does Dom does", "07:07", "it for MMA so he has to be aware the", "07:09", "kicks tie ups and clinches I mean how", "07:12", "many times you
