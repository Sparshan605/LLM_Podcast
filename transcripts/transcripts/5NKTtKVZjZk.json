time whoa", "05:26", "right so if you're if you're coasting", "05:30", "along it's at a hundred going down a", "05:32", "hill maybe you're just off the gas off", "05:34", "the brake coasting there you go power", "05:37", "reserve so if you're coasting you are", "05:40", "using zero percent of your engine right", "05:42", "and the idea is to keep that gauge low", "05:45", "because you want to be able to pass cars", "05:48", "and and cruise down the road right while", "05:51", "using 25% of this cars in July so and", "05:58", "there's stupid horse power right like", "06:00", "crazy right", "06:01", "like not like crazy crazy were like four", "06:03", "four to five hundred so high yes high", "06:05", "high high torque yes isn't that funny", "06:08", "that saying that is not that hard for", "06:10", "carve to do our standards are so crazy", "06:13", "I'm blown out our standards the Internet", "06:15", "has fucked us all up the interstate", "06:17", "I was reading about a new Miata

575", "06:54", "horsepower ls3 and it's fucking great I", "06:57", "was being say it's great you know why", "06:59", "cuz it's got these long legs you know", "07:01", "like it's a little car but it's got the", "07:03", "Corvette long legs so you're you know", "07:06", "third gears good for like 90 that's", "07:09", "great now when you drive it a car like", "07:11", "that is the balance fucked up by the", "07:13", "engines because you know it's actually", "07:15", "similar weight it it's I think them I", "07:18", "think the LS conversion is like I don't", "07:23", "want to say exactly but it's like maybe", "07:26", "that's the older car Jamie that they do", "07:28", "it to a newer one as well it's like it's", "07:30", "a few extra pounds in the front but", "07:32", "actually they have to use the rear", "07:33", "differential from a Camaro so a lot of", "07:35", "the extra weight goes in the back and so", "07:38", "the cars maybe a hundred pounds heavier", "07:40", "with the v8 in it but but it's four", "07:43", "times the power which is the weight of a", "07:45", "Miata like it's 20 350 that's so light", "07:49", "hmm and then that you see that that", "07:50", "thing in the picture was called a nexus", "07:52", "set which is so that that exoskeleton", "07:55", "thing that says fly and Miata on it oh", "07:57", "there's an interesting photograph", "07:58", "actually sorry podcast people we've got", "08:01", "two two vehicles on a track from flying", "08:03", "Miata the one in front is an exoskeleton", "08:06", "car with really no bodywork on it at all", "08:08", "and that's called an EXO set and so what", "08:11", "is you buy that chassis and you buy a", "08:14", "Miata and you take apart the Miata and", "08:16", "you put all the Miata shit on this", "08:19", "chassis and so you end up with like a", "08:21", "1200 pound thing and you can put turbos", "08:23", "and you can put VH and you can do all", "08:25", "different kind of stuff is this", "08:26", "street-legal yes it is street-legal car", "08:29", "bleah", "08:29", "and then the thing behind it is called a", "08:32", "bower catfish did you say carb legal", "08:36", "like as far as like emissions yeah yeah", "08:38", "I mean if you use a carb legal like the", "08:40", "e-rod engine like like John Ward likes", "08:42", "or the stock Miata engine for sure yeah", "08:45", "if you use a carb legal engine it's a", "08:47", "car blitz California leads", "08:48", "that's crazy I driven them there they're", "08:51", "fast but you know not nothing about EXO", "08:56", "sets design should be taken from this", "08:58", "statement I don't feel safe in them you", "09:01", "know I'm not trying to insult her in the", "09:03", "open yeah it's just to me you know I", "09:05", "like having a body around me but it's", "09:08", "way safer than a motorcycle true but a", "09:11", "motorcycle I was thinking about this a", "09:13", "motorcycle offers an experience that", "09:16", "cannot be replicated right and if you", "09:19", "are gonna take the kind of risks", "09:21", "involved in riding a motorcycle that", "09:23", "experience yeah is kind of worth it in", "09:27", "to me in short bursts whereas I don't", "09:30", "think the experience of driving a car", "09:32", "with no body on it is worth you I don't", "09:36", "think it is either but because you can", "09:39", "get a lot of awesome car with bodywork", "09:41", "yeah but it's also like the the thrill", "09:44", "of the motorcycles like it is either you", "09:46", "either have it or you don't", "09:47", "yes you're either in a convertible or", "09:49", "you're on a motorcycle yeah and the way", "09:50", "in the leaning of course is is really", "09:52", "and is that thing any more thrilling", "09:54", "than a regular convertible honestly it's", "09:57", "faster um", "09:58", "it's not faster than all convertibles", "10:00", "having the no you know the no roof right", "10:04", "I mean you just feel connected to the", "10:06", "elements yeah it's crazy and you can go", "10:08", "because it's so light you know you can", "10:11", "use an a relatively mundane engine and", "10:14", "go very very fast yeah I imagine 1,200", "10:17", "pounds yeah it's nothing I mean it's", "10:18", "nothing you know I need imagine imagine", "10:20", "a Corvette engine in that thing which", "10:21", "you can do you know I

eat probably", "111:07", "right well they care their agencies eat", "111:10", "their crops but becomes a big issue and", "111:13", "they eat the fuck so when someone was", "111:22", "explaining this to me I remember you", "111:24", "know we were saying this I was like why", "111:25", "the fuck would you ever want to kill an", "111:26", "elephant we know there's not that many", "111:28", "of them he's like yeah this is why it's", "111:30", "complicated there's not that many of", "111:32", "them in some places it's like in LA", "111:34", "there's no grizzly bears right now but", "111:37", "if you go to Montana the people that", "111:39", "live in Montana are going to start", "111:41", "hunting these fucking things they just", "111:43", "declared them open for in Wyoming", "111:47",

a tiny place in", "112:16", "comparison to Africa so when I was", "112:18", "saying that like I thought that", "112:19", "elephants were endangered he's like yes", "112:21", "and no you know they're endangered in", "112:24", "some areas within good point the fucked", "112:26", "up point the most dark point about all", "112:29", "of it is that trophy hunting is the only", "112:32", "thing that keeps those animals healthy", "112:34", "this is what's fucked up I was talking", "112:35", "about playing campaigns about this this", "112:37", "weekend when and this is when I say", "112:40", "trophy hunting I'm even talking about", "112:41", "normal hunting for", "112:43", "meat like impalas or you know eelain's", "112:46", "these and big-game animals that people", "112:48", "hunt for because they're delicious and", "112:50", "even them in Zimbabwe there's a lot of", "112:53", "areas in Zimbabwe that are not high", "112:56", "fenced they're just open enormous areas", "112:58", "all the money that would come from", "113:01", "people hunting there would sustain these", "113:03", "local areas sustained these lodges so it", "113:06", "makes it viable to keep these animals", "113:08", "alive and stop poachers a bit long as my", "113:12", "anti poaching right exactly yeah only", "113:14", "thing that funds the anti poaching so", "113:16", "here's what happened to Cecil the lion", "113:18", "shit went down nobody wanted to go to", "113:20", "Africa anymore to go hunting and all of", "113:22", "these businesses are going under so", "113:24", "there's nothing stopping the poacher so", "113:26", "the poachers move in and kill everything", "113:28", "kill everything by that that's gone the", "113:31", "other ways how many elephants were", "113:32", "killed last year by people something", "113:34", "like 400 or Google this legally killed", "113:39", "elephants the number of illegally killed", "113:42", "elephants 30,000 come on 30,000 most of", "113:47", "them are

"white white rhino or black rhino which", "113:57", "Rhino was it a black rhino yeah they", "113:59", "have that that poor bastard with armed", "114:02", "guards around 24/7 yeah because they", "114:05", "were worried someone's gonna kill it", "114:06", "shoot it and copyop the fucking horn oh", "114:08", "yeah like the poaching is way scarier", "114:11", "than the hunting and the only thing that", "114:13", "protects the animals from poaching is", "114:15", "hunting it sounds so weird and so full", "114:18", "but you have to look at it honestly yeah", "114:20", "they said something similar to us in", "114:22", "South Africa about that that that if", "114:24", "they need the funds because the anti", "114:26", "poachers you know they face there", "114:29", "they're all over the place and then", "114:31", "here's the other problem when you say", "114:32", "poachers these poachers you know what", "114:35", "you're really saying poor people that's", "114:37", "what you're really saying they're poor", "114:39", "desperate people they don't know what", "114:40", "the fuck to do and if they could chop", "114:42", "off a rhino's horn and make some money", "114:43", "they're gonna do it if they can shoot", "114:45", "that animal that's not theirs and use it", "114:47", "for me they're gonna do it yeah they're", "114:48", "starving to death well I mean they have", "114:50", "no options there's a piers people in", "114:52", "parts of Africa that are living in grass", "114:54", "huts my buddy Justin Wren he", "114:56", "and makes wells for these people in the", "114:58", "Congo and the stories he tells you would", "115:00", "just make your eyes tear up these human", "115:02", "beings and they're living like this 24", "115:04", "hours a day for their entire life and", "115:07", "this is this is the norm so we're", "115:08", "talking about poachers who are you're", "115:10", "talking about people that are fucking", "115:11", "desperate yeah you can call them", "115:13", "poachers you could dehumanize them with", "115:16", "that term but they're just poor people", "115:17", "and the only are none of them the movie", "115:19", "stereotype poachers gotta be some of", "115:22", "them but most of them aren't now here's", "115:23", "what's even crazier most of the anti", "115:26", "poaching agents used to be poachers", "115:29", "that's not you know it's not surprising", "115:32", "and now they're poachers again cuz", "115:33", "they're hunting people but they got out", "115:35", "of that got out of this position that", "115:37", "can't be anti poaching okay so now they", "115:40", "just come poachers again perfect this", "115:42", "happens to a lot of us gone well so", "115:44", "sorry this when cam Haynes was", "115:45", "explaining this to me and when he's", "115:46", "explained to me I'm like well course so", "115:48", "they don't even know how many animals", "115:49", "are left in these areas where people who", "115:50", "abandoned them fescue branches that were", "115:52", "once thriving ways to see the thing is", "115:54", "most of these animals a good percentage", "115:57", "of her were on the verge of extinction", "115:58", "just 30 years ago because people were", "116:00", "just over hunting them and poaching them", "116:01", "and doing whatever they want to him then", "116:03", "they started putting value on them", "116:04", "people would go over there to hunt them", "116:06", "so people would keep these huge areas", "116:07", "and that populations boomed yeah because", "116:10", "they were taking care of him because", "116:11", "they were they were a resource mhm and", "116:13", "and this is couldn't this is conflicting", "116:16", "to people it's wild it's very wild I", "116:18", "just went to the

"116:39", "chain of it no it's a chain of islands", "116:41", "it's like 13 or 15 islands whoa yeah", "116:44", "none as big as the Big Island but most", "116:46", "like Maui Oahu things on them there are", "116:49", "two or three like towns with like 25", "116:53", "thousand people and the rest of it is", "116:55", "nothing National Park 97% but they talk", "116:59", "about these the giant tortoises yeah you", "117:01", "know and there were like potentially a", "117:03", "half a million of them on the islands", "117:05", "and it went down to like one", "117:08", "like they found like the last one and", "117:11", "they tried to breed it there's like", "117:13", "three varieties of tortoises and the one", "117:15", "of them got down to one and they tried", "117:16", "to save it and

Mir", "117:41", "ever yeah they have thousand years no", "117:43", "they live like 200 years yeah and then", "117:45", "the the whole rest of the islands what's", "117:47", "crazy about them is nothing's been", "117:49", "hunted therein forever so the wild", "117:51", "animals have no problem with people no", "117:54", "problem", "117:55", "like you're face to face with sea lions", "117:57",
