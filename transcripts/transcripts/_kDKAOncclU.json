"19:28", "weaponized viruses", "19:29", "the the the basic premise of the show", "19:31", "was it would have someone engineered a", "19:33", "virus and released it", "19:34", "on you know on the country like a", "19:36", "weaponized virus", "19:38", "and they said that's not what we have to", "19:39", "worry about we have to worry about is", "19:41", "nature", "19:41", "that's we have to worry about turns out", "19:43", "both because this virus", "19:45", "most likely had been leaked from a lab", "19:48", "what we're dealing with with covet 19", "19:50", "according to my friend brett weinstein", "19:52", "who is a biologist and he", "19:54", "detailed on a podcast that i did with", "19:56", "him all of the different", "19:58", "points of evidence that that lead to", "20:01", "what he believes is a very likely", "20:04", "scenario that it was released from", "20:05", "accidentally released from", "20:07", "a lab and not actually from a wet market", "20:09", "to the wet market's the cover-up", "20:11", "it's like the disease is too advanced it", "20:13", "has too many", "20:14", "hallmarks and indicators of a virus that", "20:17", "had been tampered with for", "20:18", "study for uh for for studying the lab", "20:21", "and for", "20:22", "the examinations and all the different", "20:24", "tests that they would run", "20:25", "and uh so you got both those things", "20:28", "right you have", "20:28", "you have um the possibility of something", "20:32", "just morphing in nature", "20:33", "like many other pandemics that have", "20:35", "happened in the past and then what we", "20:37", "have now", "20:37", "which is this weird virus it doesn't", "20:40", "make any sense we were talking about all", "20:41", "the different", "20:43", "different symptoms that people get from", "20:44", "it neurological problems", "20:46", "blood clotting i was reading this", "20:47", "article where they were saying that uh", "20:49", "the people that have died from", "20:50", "uh covet when they've done autopsies on", "20:52", "them they found blood clots in every", "20:54", "major organ", "20:56", "and they they're like this is", "20:57", "astonishing like this is so weird yeah", "20:59", "it does seem very", "21:00", "long liver kidney but just blood clots", "21:03", "everywhere it's like", "21:05", "people are hemorrhaging it's it's very", "21:06", "strange it's a strange fucking virus and", "21:10", "the um the transmissibility is that a", "21:13", "word", "21:14", "the uh the the the ease of transmission", "21:17", "is terrifying it's so", "21:18", "it's so contagious it's a ridiculously", "21:21", "contagious virus so", "21:23", "once we went to that center for disease", "21:24", "control i started getting scared i saw", "21:26", "the 2015 bill gates ted talk", "21:29", "on uh pandemics and about the", "21:32", "possibility of a pandemic and i got", "21:33", "scared of it too", "21:34", "so i would have thought it's possible", "21:37", "yeah i", "21:38", "would never would have thought it's", "21:39", "impossible so here's the thing", "21:41", "regardless of", "21:41", "of where this virus came from you have", "21:44", "to imagine", "21:45", "that uh there are governments and", "21:48", "individuals", "21:49", "uh who are now keyed into how effective", "21:52", "this visit", "21:52", "this virus was at crippling uh", "21:55", "capitalist

it's people moving around it's", "22:06", "it's", "22:06", "you know the neoliberal global", "22:08", "capitalist system", "22:10", "that we built over the past 30 years", "22:12", "that created the pathways that", "22:13", "that took the virus everywhere at once", "22:15", "right so", "22:17", "if this were to be a test run", "22:20", "um it's now proven to be extremely", "22:22", "effective and so you have to imagine", "22:24", "that governments around the world", "22:25", "probably including the united states are", "22:27", "thinking", "22:28", "well what uh you know how could we how", "22:29", "could we weaponize this potentially", "22:32", "and this is the thing the united states", "22:34", "is thinking that but well i don't i", "22:36", "don't i don't know either but the thing", "22:37", "is we", "22:37", "you know the threats existential threats", "22:40", "that", "22:41", "uh we face now have been multiplied", "22:43", "exponentially", "22:44", "right in the pas in the past you know", "22:47", "post world war ii", "22:48", "right we had i mean this is the first", "22:51", "sort of global catastrophe right", "22:52", "you know world world wars right but then", "22:54", "once we develop nuclear weapons and", "22:56", "we're just past the 75th anniversary of", "22:59", "the", "22:59", "the trinity test now uh you know once we", "23:02", "create that ability to destroy ourselves", "23:04", "and", "23:04", "potentially the entire world we have to", "23:06", "live with with the possibility of that", "23:08", "happening", "23:08", "right now stack on top of that", "23:11", "artificial intelligence", "23:12", "climate change you know synthetic", "23:14", "biotech uh all", "23:16", "all of these threats that we face are", "23:17", "are something that we have to kind of", "23:19", "hold in our heads all the time and i", "23:20", "think it's cracking us", "23:22", "mentally to like think about these", "23:24", "possibilities so", "23:25", "um yeah i mean some of the preppers are", "23:27", "conspiracy theorists right and they're", "23:29", "they're spinning some really outlandish", "23:30", "scenarios", "23:31", "uh but a lot of them are just trying to", "23:34", "work through these things", "23:35", "right and rather than get caught in this", "23:38", "kind of perpetual future tense", "23:40", "like you know uh thinking about", "23:42", "something terrible happening", "23:43", "they're trying to take action now in the", "23:45", "present and that gives them some sense", "23:47", "of", "23:48", "of peace right like it gives them a", "23:50", "sense of like it gives them some solid", "23:52", "footing in the present", "23:53", "and a lot of the preppers i talked to", "23:55", "were um", "23:56", "uh are not actually very anxious or", "23:59", "paranoid at all", "24:01", "right because they have a plan it's", "24:04", "those of us who don't have a plan that", "24:06", "are", "24:06", "that are anxious well you've talked to", "24:08", "them post post", "24:10", "po yeah yeah um do they feel vindicated", "24:14", "uh no not really no what what most of", "24:17", "them have told me is that this was a", "24:19", "mid-level crisis", "24:20", "well they're right about that right i", "24:22", "mean if yellowstone blows this is going", "24:24", "to look like a cakewalk", "24:25", "yeah if we get hit with an asteroid i",

of one percent for for most healthy", "24:51", "people", "24:52", "so when you look at what what could", "24:54", "happen if yellowstone blows that's a", "24:56", "continent killer", "24:57", "oh yeah

"29:55", "to literally the most remote spot in the", "29:57", "world with", "29:58", "which is hawaii dude have you ever seen", "29:59", "their maps that are made out of sticks", "30:01", "no dude they have so they're these uh", "30:03", "they're 3d maps that are made from like", "30:05", "sticks put together and they can tell", "30:07", "wind and", "30:08", "air currents and they can read the stars", "30:09", "with them that's how they navigated", "30:11", "really yeah whoa yeah they're fantastic", "30:13", "where did you see one", "30:14", "uh i don't know well actually my uh i", "30:17", "did my master's degree in maritime", "30:19", "archaeology so i probably picked that up", "30:21", "during that degree at some", "30:22", "point so you you did uh some of your", "30:24", "studies was", "30:25", "were in sydney right yeah i started i", "30:28", "actually started here", "30:29", "um at the university of california i did", "30:31", "anthropology and history", "30:33", "i went to australia to do a degree in", "30:35", "maritime archaeology", "30:36", "and then i went to london to do a phd in", "30:38", "cultural geography", "30:39", "oh wow so i've hopped four disciplines", "30:42", "did you get anything jamie", "30:44", "let me see what this looks like yeah", "30:45", "yeah look at those things shit", "30:47", "they're sweet right wow what is that", "30:51", "obviously i have absolutely no idea how", "30:52", "to oh my how to read those things that's", "30:54", "so", "30:55", "weird see so how do they tie them", "30:57", "together with twine or like what is", "30:59", "yeah i think it's twine and what are", "31:01", "those images supposed to represent", "31:04", "what is that it's like it's the wind the", "31:06", "tides and the stars i think what is that", "31:09", "word hold on", "31:09", "scroll up micronesian", "31:12", "whoa micronesians you ever heard that", "31:15", "word yeah micronesian so that micronesia", "31:17", "is like um", "31:18", "uh uh chook what are those four islands", "31:21", "uh truck lagoon that's in chook and i", "31:24", "can't remember the other islands but", "31:26", "look how crazy that is yeah god i love", "31:29", "learning new shit", "31:30", "so here's the thing right is that is", "31:32", "that one of the things that preppers are", "31:33", "into", "31:33", "is like recovering these kinds of skills", "31:36", "so", "31:37", "you know trying to learn how these", "31:38", "things work and building them again", "31:40", "uh when i was at the university of", "31:41", "california i did two years of lithic", "31:43", "technology where i i", "31:44", "you know i can make uh arrowheads stone", "31:46", "tools can you really", "31:48", "lateral darts axes yeah i spent years", "31:50", "doing that you know how to make an", "31:51", "add-a-lattle", "31:51", "yeah really yeah can you throw one you", "31:54", "know how to do it", "31:54", "yeah we threw one at uc riverside yeah", "31:57", "where i was studying yeah we made this", "31:58", "at little dart and then we sort of like", "32:00", "you know cleared out the", "32:01", "the the kind of alleyway in the", "32:04", "experimental archaeology lab we were", "32:05", "working we were chucking this out", "32:07", "lateral dart", "32:08", "indoors are outdoors we probably", "32:09", "couldn't get away with that now but yeah", "32:10", "probably not", "32:11", "outdoors now when they taught you how to", "32:13", "do all this stuff", "32:15", "when when they're talking about like", "32:16", "building ancient arrowheads", "32:19", "is the uh technology behind creating", "32:22", "those the craftsmanship", "32:24", "is it uh theoretical or are they getting", "32:27", "it down", "32:28", "from the the people that where the", "32:30", "knowledge has been handed down", "32:31", "oh it's definitely the case that the", "32:32", "knowledge is being handed down um", "32:34", "and what's really interesting is that is", "32:36", "that uh", "32:38", "i know you talked to graham hancock but", "32:40", "like the so the the earliest", "32:42", "uh uh spear points", "32:45", "that we think are the are evidence of", "32:47", "the earliest occupation of the americas", "32:49", "these are", "32:50", "um clovis so he talked about clovis", "32:52", "cultures right", "32:53", "those clovis points are so hard to make", "32:55", "dude and they're they're making these", "32:57", "like 12 13 000 years ago", "32:59", "so so it's essentially uh you take", "33:02", "you get a piece of rock right and you", "33:03", "have to flatten the rock first", "33:05", "right so you've got to send flakes with", "33:07", "a hammer stone across", "33:08", "the rock and create like a ridge down", "33:10", "the middle and then", "33:12", "in one strike you take that whole ridge", "33:14", "off", "33:15", "and you create this flat expanse down", "33:17", "the middle of the spear point", "33:18", "with one strike yeah and that's what you", "33:20", "that's what you haft", "33:22", "the shaft to with some sinew or whatever", "33:24", "but the thing is that that one strike", "33:26", "you have to do it on both sides", "33:28", "right you have to make a flat edge on", "33:29", "both sides down the middle of the spear", "33:31", "point", "33:31", "it almost always cracks the thing in", "33:33", "half and what is the", "33:35", "material that you're using for the", "33:37", "striker and what is the material use it", "33:39", "for the arrowhead", "33:40", "so if the the easiest stone uh to", "33:43", "flintknap with is obsidian", "33:45", "it's got a really really high uh silica", "33:47", "value in it and it's it's highly heated", "33:49", "so it's like glass", "33:50", "right and that's what um the aztecs were", "33:53", "were", "33:54", "making their weapons out of too so you", "33:55", "can see you can see obsidian weapons all", "33:57", "up and down", "33:59", "uh north central and south america um", "34:02", "but you can also work with like flint or", "34:04", "chert", "34:05", "those things are a little trickier right", "34:07", "they're all over", "34:08", "texas the comanche left so many", "34:10", "arrowheads uh", "34:11", "go to gary clark jr's instagram page he", "34:14", "has a", "34:15", "fucking perfect arrowhead that they", "34:18", "found", "34:18", "on a friend of his ranch it's", "34:21", "it's amazing when you you look at this", "34:23", "and you go okay this is probably", "34:25", "hundreds of years ago some guy sent this", "34:28", "and", "34:28", "look at that look how perfect oh that's", "34:30", "gorgeous look how perfect it is", "34:32", "it's perfect dude i'll make you one i", "34:35", "can't", "34:35", "i can't i would appreciate that but i re", "34:38", "i found one once i was hunting", "34:40", "in uh nevada i was uh doing a high", "34:42", "country mule deer hunt and i found one", "34:45", "i fucking lost it i don't know what", "34:46", "happened but it was just", "34:48", "it was a chunk it had broken but that", "34:50", "one go back to that one again", "34:51", "real quick that's perfect i mean look at", "34:55", "the", "34:55", "oh it's really nice it's it's not", "34:57", "damaged at all", "34:59", "so what you see what do you think that's", "35:01", "made out of", "35:02", "i think it's chert so chert often has", "35:05", "this kind of chalky", "35:07", "exterior that you've got to get off of", "35:08", "it before you hurt yeah", "35:10", "i've never even heard of that yeah how", "35:12", "old do you think that is", "35:13", "if you had a guess seven eight hundred", "35:17", "years", "35:18", "i think so check this out man one of the", "35:19", "one of the coolest experiences i ever", "35:21", "had so", "35:22", "i did archaeology for about five years i", "35:25", "excavated in", "35:26", "in mexico in the yucatan peninsula in", "35:28", "hawaii", "35:29", "in australia and in southern and", "35:31", "northern california", "35:33", "and when i was in mexico we were we were", "35:35", "working on this old village site it's a", "35:37", "post-classic maya site and we're digging", "35:41", "up like there's just", "35:42", "loads of pottery right because think", "35:44", "about if you're you know you make a pot", "35:46", "inevitably you're going to drop and", "35:47", "break that thing and what do you do you", "35:48", "sweep it out the front door you know and", "35:50", "so we'd find these huge", "35:51", "um uh", "35:55", "pits that are just full of of pottery", "35:57", "shirts", "35:58", "and you know after a while you just", "36:00", "become totally desensitized to it you're", "36:02", "just chucking them in a bag and oh", "36:03", "here's where i found 10 more or whatever", "36:04", "and then", "36:05", "one of them i pulled out and it had a", "36:07", "fingerprint in it", "36:09", "oh dude and i'm looking at the thing and", "36:11", "it's like", "36:14", "yeah suddenly i've traveled through time", "36:16", "right i've gone back 1200 years and i'm", "36:19", "sitting there with", "36:20", "you know sitting there with this person", "36:21", "in their house with their thumbprint", "36:23", "pressed into this thing it really", "36:25", "unnerved me", "36:26", "wow i mean you know in in archaeological", "36:29", "terms", "36:30", "meh you know it doesn't actually tell us", "36:32", "that much we got we got ten thousand", "36:34", "pieces of those pots but", "36:36", "on a personal level that you know", "36:38", "experiencing that visceral connection to", "36:40", "the history of humankind is unparalleled", "36:43", "right it's because you know someone made", "36:45", "the pottery but it's almost", "36:46", "abstract until you see that fingerprint", "36:48", "yeah", "36:50", "but that's fucking awesome god yeah we", "36:53", "also one time i", "36:54", "found this we were walking through the", "36:55", "jungle we were actually serving", "36:57", "we found a temple in in the yucatan that", "37:00", "uh like the local people knew about but", "37:03", "no one from the university had seen it", "37:04", "and so this guy is like", "37:06", "oh you want a temple you have the temple", "37:07", "over there you know so we're like", "37:09", "hacking through the bushes with our", "37:11", "through the vines with our machetes", "37:13", "and uh and we come up on this temple and", "37:15", "i was like oh man this is", "37:17", "this is crazy like how many people have", "37:18", "seen this thing in in the past you know", "37:20", "300 years", "37:22", "and then there were kind of some central", "37:24", "stairs going up the middle of the temple", "37:27", "and i went there and looked on the", "37:28", "ground and there was this like a there", "37:29", "was this figurine", "37:30", "there uh and it had it had eyes and like", "37:34", "a kind of", "37:35", "a little hat but it was like somebody", "37:36", "had made this thing out of clay and", "37:38", "pressed it together", "37:39", "um i never figured out how old that was", "37:42", "i mean it could have been made more", "37:43", "recently did you take it kind of weird", "37:45", "uh we we bagged it and tagged it as they", "37:47", "say in archaeology", "37:49", "it went back to the lab what are the", "37:50", "rules on that like if you", "37:52", "if you go to a temple they take you to a", "37:54", "temple and you find something that's", "37:56", "there", "37:57", "what are you allowed to say i'm a", "37:58", "scientist well", "38:00", "okay so i became really uncomfortable", "38:04", "with the idea that you know because i", "38:05", "had a degree", "38:07", "i had some kind of authority over other", "38:08", "people's culture right that's why i'm", "38:10", "asking yeah and i always felt like well", "38:12", "that you know that village that's there", "38:13", "that's their", "38:14", "shit why are we taking it right you know", "38:16", "um and", "38:17", "obviously it's for the advancement of", "38:19", "knowledge and maybe it brings some", "38:20", "benefit to their village but we don't", "38:21", "know", "38:22", "right so uh this is eventually what", "38:24", "drove me out of archaeology", "38:27", "um from my my master's thesis i went up", "38:30", "to northern california", "38:31", "and i worked with this tribe called the", "38:33", "winimum win two", "38:35", "and uh they it's a it's a pretty tragic", "38:38", "story up there man they", "38:39", "they had been there for thousands of", "38:41", "years", "38:42", "and um you know we we", "38:45", "americans decided that they were going", "38:47", "to uh build a giant dam", "38:49", "so they could have a reservoir up there", "38:51", "and they and they", "38:52", "inundated all of their ancestral", "38:54", "homelands like all of their spiritual", "38:56", "sites", "38:57", "all of their graveyards i mean all this", "38:58", "stuff went underwater", "39:00", "so i'd spent two years uh doing a degree", "39:03", "in", "39:04", "maritime archaeology i've been diving", "39:05", "shipwrecks all over the world", "39:07", "and i s and i went up there and i said", "39:09", "let me let me dive", "39:10", "let me dive in the in the reservoir and", "39:13", "you know i've got my underwater camera", "39:15", "and", "39:15", "you know i said i'll take some photos", "39:17", "i'll bring them back we can have a chat", "39:18", "about it", "39:19", "and the spiritual leader of the tribe", "39:21", "kayleen", "39:22", "she says all right well why don't you", "39:25", "just hang out for a bit", "39:26", "and then maybe we can do that later so", "39:28", "like days", "39:29", "turn into weeks and then you know a", "39:31", "couple months and i'm getting nervous", "39:33", "i'm like", "39:33", "i have to write my thesis i have no i", "39:35", "don't have my i don't have my data", "39:37", "right during these months you're hanging", "39:38", "out with me i'm just yeah i'm just", "39:39", "hanging out there", "39:40", "eating dinner with them yeah yeah", "39:42", "exactly how do you have all this time", "39:44", "yeah we actually went uh well it's the", "39:46", "degree right like like that's what i'm", "39:48", "there to do i'm doing my field work", "39:50", "and you can just hang out for months", "39:51", "yeah but i'm supposed to be like doing", "39:53", "research and writing a thesis", "39:55", "you know and so i i after a while i", "39:58", "press her", "39:58", "i'm like look i've gotta i've gotta do", "40:01", "something", "40:02", "and she said you know what the problem", "40:03", "with you white people is you're obsessed", "40:05", "with stuff", "40:07", "you just wanna get your hands on the", "40:08", "things you know and she said if you want", "40:10", "to know about our culture", "40:12", "you've been hanging out with us this", "40:14", "whole time what can you tell me about", "40:16", "our culture", "40:16", "like why do you need to get that that", "40:19", "all that stuff that's you know", "40:20", "underwater out there why do you need", "40:22", "that you know you can just talk to us", "40:24", "so that was sort of my bridge from", "40:25", "moving from archaeology into cultural", "40:28", "geography", "40:28", "which is much more about you know", "40:30", "thinking about people's relationships", "40:32", "with places and landscapes", "40:33", "and their culture is documented", "40:36", "in what way like how how are they", "40:38", "maintaining", "40:39", "their historical records well that's", "40:41", "what this was actually my", "40:42", "one of my first academic articles is i", "40:45", "wrote about how", "40:46", "a lot of their religious ceremonies had", "40:49", "changed because", "40:50", "the places that they used to go were now", "40:52", "underwater right so and so in one case", "40:54", "there was this uh there was a rock", "40:56", "um that young women went to as part of a", "40:59", "puberty ceremony", "41:01", "and it used to be above water", "41:04", "and they had that ceremony in the spring", "41:06", "but now when the", "41:08", "uh that's when the uh the waters are", "41:10", "high", "41:11", "right so now they do it in sort of", "41:12", "drought season so that they can still", "41:14", "get to the rock and so they had they had", "41:16", "changed the whole kind of", "41:18", "you know cultural their cultural fabric", "41:20", "had been altered", "41:22", "by that inundation event and basically", "41:24", "you know the point that she was", "41:26", "trying to get across to me was like that", "41:28", "didn't break us", "41:29", "like we're still us even even though", "41:32", "these things have had to change", "41:33", "you know and that it was an education", "41:35", "for me as an archaeologist because", "41:37", "you know when you when you go into a", "41:40", "place with that very kind of like", "41:41", "data-driven", "41:42", "empirical mindset you know you want you", "41:44", "want hard facts that make sense that you", "41:47", "know that you can", "41:48", "you can write up clearly and what she", "41:50", "was telling me was something that was a", "41:51", "little bit more", "41:52", "it was more nuanced you know it was", "41:54", "difficult to pin down it was more", "41:56", "you know qualitative right and so i had", "41:58", "to i had to grapple with that and that", "42:00", "was a that was a big learning lesson for", "42:01", "me", "42:02", "so in this but when you're dealing with", "42:05", "things that are more nuanced", "42:07", "you you still need to kind of know", "42:10", "what happened and when it happened so", "42:12", "how are they", "42:13", "keeping records of what happened and", "42:16", "when it happened well they had oral", "42:17", "histories but i think", "42:19", "yeah but i could also go to um uh", "42:22", "the uh bureau of reclamation the forest", "42:25", "service you know there were", "42:26", "i was actually working for the bureau of", "42:28", "land management at that time", "42:30", "but i mean so those federal agencies", "42:31", "have records of what happened", "42:33", "right with i mean you know with the", "42:35", "building of the dam and what was", "42:36", "recorded beforehand and all of that", "42:37", "which is kind of fucked that they did", "42:39", "that right", "42:39", "yeah but the but what i mean internally", "42:42", "i mean in the tribe", "42:44", "everything is orally yeah you know", "42:47", "there's probably more people writing", "42:48", "things down now these days but", "42:50", "you know they've got oral histories that", "42:51", "go back a long time when i was in", "42:53", "australia i get this man", "42:54", "i i was uh talking", "42:58", "to uh an aboriginal clan out there and", "43:01", "they were telling me that in the sydney", "43:02", "harbor", "43:03", "they can actually tell like they can", "43:05", "draw you a map of what is underwater in", "43:08", "the sydney harbor because they have a", "43:09", "cultural memory of when that wasn't", "43:11", "under water", "43:12", "that goes back tens of thousands of", "43:14", "years", "43:15", "and they have passed that down they", "43:17", "actually retained that memory", "43:18", "so they have a pre-ice age memory when", "43:21", "the", "43:22", "oceans were less deep yeah i don't know", "43:25", "if it's pre-ice age but the", "43:26", "the water levels were you know yeah so", "43:29", "the water level's a little lower", "43:30", "it has to be pre-ice age if it's before", "43:32", "10 000 years yeah", "43:33", "right so these people had this idea of", "43:35", "what was going on", "43:37", "and they just kept passing it down", "43:39", "generation to generation", "43:40", "yeah and this how accurate is their", "43:44", "their their memory of it i don't know i", "43:46", "mean i'm sure i'm sure people are doing", "43:47", "research on that but you know", "43:49", "if you look at those those um uh", "43:52", "the dot drawings you know those like", "43:54", "traditional paintings that you see", "43:56", "uh that are often paintings of", "43:58", "landscapes", "43:59", "some of those have been mapped onto uh", "44:03", "you know aerial imagery and they're", "44:05", "startlingly accurate", "44:07", "right and so you have to wonder it like", "44:09", "how", "44:10", "how did people who didn't have those", "44:13", "aerial views", "44:14", "get that view down on the landscape", "44:16", "right right i mean", "44:18", "yeah yeah do you stitch that together by", "44:21", "just knowing the place so well", "44:23", "that you can't you can kind of depict it", "44:25", "in that way or is there some kind of i",

down we're going to start", "93:34", "over you know", "93:35", "and so that tribalization is extremely", "93:38", "problematic because", "93:39", "as you know you're right the", "93:40", "conversation we need to be having is a", "93:42", "collective conversation about like", "93:44", "what are the threats and how do we", "93:45", "address them yeah and there seems to be", "93:47", "a breakdown",

we developed nuclear", "94:08", "weapons i mean it was", "94:09", "it was impossible to shelter everyone", "94:12", "from this disaster right i mean i think", "94:15", "the", "94:16", "the early estimates uh that were given", "94:18", "to the truman administration were", "94:20", "was that it would be like the gdp of the", "94:22", "country for an entire year", "94:24", "to build blast

that the government built bunkers", "94:35", "for themselves", "94:36", "but not for us right and a lot of the", "94:40", "you know if you if there's a through", "94:42", "line there that if you move from the", "94:44", "cold war", "94:46", "into like the age of survivalists", "94:49", "right like the the 80s you know when you", "94:51", "had uh", "94:52", "ted ted kaczynski the unabomber right in", "94:55", "his cabin he's kind of like", "94:56", "he stands as a kind of symbol of this", "94:58", "like lone wolf", "95:00", "survivalist right that's kind of sort of", "95:02", "well", "95:03",

going to stop paying", "95:17", "taxes and go off grid they were going to", "95:19", "become", "95:19", "uh self-sustaining whatever what you can", "95:22", "see with a lot of those", "95:24",

because they're like if you can't", "95:33", "protect us we'll protect ourselves right", "95:35", "okay and so now we get we get to today", "95:38", "and we've got 3.7 million americans", "95:41", "identify as preppers now", "95:43", "they self-identify as preppers right", "95:47", "and what you hear from a lot of them is", "95:50", "this kind of what we now interpret is a", "95:52", "kind of libertarian narrative it's like", "95:54", "well i'm just going to take care of", "95:55", "myself", "95:56", "and my family you know it's like i'm", "95:58", "just going it on my own i don't", "96:00", "i don't trust the government it's not", "96:01", "one percent okay it's basically in the", "96:02", "neighborhood of one percent", "96:04", "one percent yeah yeah i mean it's a it's", "96:07", "a significant amount of people", "96:09", "i hung out with uh probably", "96:12", "i went to half a dozen countries i", "96:15", "interviewed maybe a hundred people", "96:17", "and i um and i was just i mean i", "96:21", "just got to the tip of this thing you", "96:23", "know i mean do we have the most", "96:25", "oh for sure with without a doubt without", "96:28", "a doubt", "96:28", "but country's number two okay but look", "96:30", "if you if you contrast", "96:32", "this to switzerland for instance where", "96:34", "they they did build the bunkers for the", "96:36", "entire population", "96:37", "really right for 110 of the population", "96:40", "just in case visitors are in town", "96:41", "wow the whole country can go underground", "96:44", "right now", "96:45", "right now still functional yeah totally", "96:47", "well yeah you know i don't know", "96:48", "it's something is it funny that they're", "96:49", "neutral and they're like", "96:52", "but that's to i mean you know but once", "96:54", "you've once you've prepared yourself", "96:56", "you've built your defenses you're able", "96:57", "to do that because you're like yeah go", "96:59", "ahead and attack", "97:00", "good luck yeah we should have known from", "97:01", "their knives that they're preparing for", "97:03", "things like getting", "97:04", "a knife with scissors on it and a", "97:06", "screwdriver what are you", "97:08", "what are you planning yeah but north", "97:11", "korea is another example i mean that", "97:12", "country is essentially underground", "97:14", "they they have um fleets of aircraft", "97:18", "inside mountains", "97:20", "i mean they got like it would actually", "97:22", "be incredibly difficult to", "97:24", "attack that country because after the", "97:25", "korean war it was essentially flattened", "97:27", "right and they learned from that", "97:29", "experience like we we've got to go", "97:30", "underground", "97:31", "if we're going to survive the next war", "97:33", "do we have an accurate account", "97:35", "of what they have uh no not at all", "97:38", "really but there's a lot of there's a", "97:39", "there's a a place here in california", "97:42", "an institute called the nautilus", "97:44", "institute and they do a lot of that", "97:45", "research where they're just like", "97:47", "scrolling around on google earth and", "97:48", "trying to figure out you know is that a", "97:50", "vent shaft to a bunker and can we", "97:52", "estimate the size of that thing and", "97:54", "it's kind of fun to dig through their", "97:55", "website because most of it was", "97:56", "constructed pre-satellite is that what", "97:58", "it is", "97:59", "yeah um yeah but there are telltale", "98:01", "signs of a bunker", "98:03", "can you go google earth over north korea", "98:06", "uh parts of it i think", "98:08", "huh that's interesting yeah", "98:12", "i think parts of it you can look at", "98:13", "ultimately the entire surface of the", "98:15", "earth is going to be", "98:16", "it's it's going to be mapped out right", "98:19", "yeah", "98:20", "i've actually got a friend um who's been", "98:23", "he gave he gave a paper at a conference", "98:25", "i hosted where he was talking about", "98:28", "measuring gravity from space and", "98:31", "basically you could you could measure", "98:32", "the mass or the density of subterranean", "98:35", "infrastructures and essentially you", "98:37", "could see inside the earth", "98:39", "um and so he was actually developing a", "98:42", "theory a theory for", "98:43", "spoofing the gravity measurements you", "98:46", "know so like you could build a bunker to", "98:47", "look like a subterranean river", "98:49", "right so you look at it from space and", "98:52", "you're like oh no that's a geological", "98:55", "structure yeah formation but because", "98:57", "obviously a bunker's pretty obvious you", "98:59", "know if you", "98:59", "if you see a giant square hole would it", "99:02", "be possible to spoof it by", "99:04", "doing something that would offset", "99:06", "whatever", "99:07", "signal that's giving off definitely yeah", "99:10", "i think he had he had three theories for", "99:12", "spoofing and that was another one", "99:14", "i don't remember the third one but dude", "99:16", "the", "99:17", "the earth is already swiss cheese", "99:20", "there's so much stuff underground i mean", "99:22", "before before i worked with preppers my", "99:24", "previous project was working with urban", "99:26", "explorers i spent 10 years", "99:28", "in london breaking into", "99:31", "abandoned buildings construction sites", "99:34", "and subterranean infrastructure", "99:36", "and we started so we started by opening", "99:38", "manholes", "99:39", "and getting into the london sewer system", "99:41", "which is quite cool it's", "99:42", "you know 250 years old", "99:47", "you open a manhole and you climb down a", "99:49", "ladder and then you're suddenly in this", "99:51", "this victorian infrastructure where", "99:54", "there's there's i think 318 million", "99:56", "hand-laid bricks right in these and", "99:59", "these beautiful tunnels that stretch", "100:01", "down", "100:01", "they're gravity fed and that's how", "100:03", "they're cleaned as well", "100:05", "and there are combined systems so it's", "100:07", "fresh water and sewage how old are they", "100:10", "these are 18 1850s", "100:13", "so we went down there because a lot of", "100:16", "these used to be", "100:17", "subterranean rivers and we were curious", "100:20", "like what they all happened to the", "100:21", "rivers well they were all turned into", "100:22", "sewers", "100:23", "so i know but their sewers are actually", "100:25", "they're not as bad as they sound", "100:27", "um what does that mean", "100:28", "[Laughter]", "100:30", "they're beautiful they're beautiful", "100:32", "beautiful poop streams i've got", "100:34", "i've got photos on my flickr page and", "100:36", "instagram whatever you can go see the", "100:37", "sewers", "100:38", "in london that's my photo actually so", "100:40", "that is a sewer in london", "100:41", "how does it smell down there uh that's", "100:43", "actually that's a sewer in paris", "100:44", "oh but that is my photo um there's", "100:48", "you there's me climbing what are you", "100:50", "doing why are you doing that climbing a", "100:51", "construction crane", "100:52", "that's terrifying do you have a harness", "100:55", "on or anything", "100:55", "no fuck bro don't die dude this thing so", "100:58", "look at this thing right here this is a", "101:00", "this is a um uh you know remember the", "101:02", "concord jets", "101:04", "this is a concord jet engine testing", "101:06", "facility and we found this giant", "101:08", "abandoned factory where they're", "101:09", "producing the concord engines and", "101:11", "and uh snuck in there and they later", "101:13", "turned that into a set for stargate", "101:16", "we found like the gate for the stargate", "101:18", "we really slid open yeah", "101:20", "oh wow so that's london that's a london", "101:22", "sewer but that's a newer one", "101:23", "that's a sewer yeah how's that smell", "101:26", "that's fine", "101:27", "what does that mean does it you have a", "101:29", "t-shirt that says do epic shit", "101:31", "yeah that's over chicago wow", "101:35", "some cool photography thanks what are", "101:37", "you using for uh these", "101:39", "photographs uh at the time i was", "101:43", "shooting on a", "101:44", "canon 5d mark iii but you know yeah", "101:47", "basically i had a big dslr", "101:49", "now i've got a mirrorless camera but", "101:50", "they're all they're all tripod shots", "101:52", "that's the queen mary that's amazing", "101:54", "these are crazy pictures", "101:55", "is this um in one of those books that", "101:57", "you should get you gave me yeah i gave", "102:00", "you two books i gave you subterranean", "102:01", "london and london rising", "102:03", "and basically that's a span of ten years", "102:05", "from like", "102:06", "2008 to 2018 something like that", "102:09", "um where we were sneaking into all of", "102:12", "these places we were trespassing and", "102:14", "taking photos that was like", "102:16", "so these urban explorers uh", "102:20", "they're interested in like they see the", "102:21", "city as kind of like an operating system", "102:23", "right like it's supposed to function in", "102:26", "a certain way", "102:27", "um and they were interested in", "102:28", "disrupting that operating system and", "102:30", "trying to sort of like get to the code", "102:31", "behind the city like we want to see the", "102:33", "wires we want to see the tunnels", "102:35", "we want to see the construction sites we", "102:36", "want to see how all this shit is", "102:38", "functioning how's the sewage work", "102:40", "yeah exactly when you flush your toilet", "102:41", "where does it go right and we figured it", "102:43", "out", "102:43", "you know like i went underneath my own", "102:45", "house and", "102:46", "followed the pipe that came from my", "102:48", "house into a sewer that went to an", "102:50", "interceptor sewer that went to a pumping", "102:52", "station i walked the whole thing", "102:53", "it was super fascinating to actually", "102:55", "figure out how it functioned right", "102:57", "so after 10 years of doing this i now", "103:00", "have this map of london in my head that", "103:02", "is in three dimensions", "103:03", "right so underneath the sewers you had", "103:07", "um utility tunnels so gas electricity", "103:11", "uh telecommunications what is happening", "103:13", "there watering from a boat", "103:14", "that's me coming out of a manhole into", "103:16", "into an electricity tunnel", "103:18", "whoa yeah that's the electricity tunnel", "103:21", "under london", "103:21", "yeah well there's there's tons of them", "103:24", "so you could just get in there and just", "103:25", "fucking", "103:26", "chop at those wires if you wanted to oh", "103:28", "well", "103:30", "you could do some damage isn't that", "103:32", "weird it's really weird", "103:34", "like someone could just leave a bomb", "103:36", "there yeah right", "103:38", "and like what occurred to me over and", "103:40", "over again as as we were sneaking into", "103:41", "these places", "103:42", "is that it was really easy yeah and so", "103:45", "we're", "103:45", "again we're all saturated by these", "103:47", "narratives about", "103:48", "terrorism and people are out to get us", "103:50", "and they're all in our cities and", "103:51", "they're sleeper cells and we're all in", "103:53", "danger", "103:54", "and then you know we're going out like", "103:57", "you know a bunch of 20 year olds", "103:59", "with some with some keys that we bought", "104:01", "on amazon", "104:02", "and just opening everything up and going", "104:04", "into it right and i", "104:06", "i don't know it just it made me feel", "104:08", "like i was being lied to", "104:09", "when you talked about that wasn't what", "104:11", "was promised when you talk all these", "104:12", "prepper folks", "104:13", "um how concerned are they about the", "104:15", "power grid and", "104:16", "how many of them believe that the future", "104:19", "is going to be", "104:20", "uh being autonomous having some sort of", "104:22", "autonomous power supply whether it's", "104:23", "wind or solar", "104:25", "well that's that's a i mean that's a", "104:27", "strong narrative right", "104:29", "that like the way we prep now we", "104:31", "couldn't have prepped 10 years ago", "104:32", "because technology is facilitating", "104:34", "it right we've got solar panels we've", "104:36", "got battery backup systems you know", "104:37", "we've got ways of creating", "104:39", "of going off-grid becoming", "104:41", "self-sufficient", "104:42", "that we didn't have before", "104:45", "a lot of preppers that i talked to are", "104:47", "really concerned about", "104:50", "a cme a coronal mass ejection you know", "104:53", "a plasma burp from the sun which happens", "104:56", "that sends us", "104:57", "it happens all the time yeah um the uh", "105:00", "the northern lights the aurora

then", "111:51", "put it in a dumpster", "111:52", "and fly back to england that dude needs", "111:54", "a better hobby he did it", "111:56", "why would he do he did it dude that", "111:58", "seems like a waste of time", "111:59", "well like you know paddling it wasn't", "112:01", "you know about engines it was a it was a", "112:02", "commentary you know and", "112:04", "reuse and recycling and waste and why", "112:06", "would he put it in a dumpster after he", "112:07", "was done hit a perfectly good boat", "112:09", "it's true yeah go fishing i went with", "112:13", "him for the last week of the thing and", "112:14", "it was fucking hilarious he was just", "112:16", "constantly sinking like at first we were", "112:18", "at first we were trying to bail out his", "112:20", "boat because we had like i was in the", "112:21", "safety boat and we're going alongside", "112:23", "him and i'm trying to like bail out his", "112:24", "boat with a cup", "112:25", "because everything we everything that we", "112:27", "were using had to be found", "112:28", "right so i'd like found this like broken", "112:31", "big gulp cup", "112:32", "from 7-eleven i was like trying to bail", "112:34", "how come they couldn't seal it", "112:35", "properly well he he tried but it just he", "112:38", "got tired", "112:39", "you know he was paddling all day and", "112:41", "then he would get out at night and then", "112:42", "he had to find the shit to fix the boat", "112:45", "right so you had to go find some kind of", "112:46", "sealant or find a piece of styrofoam to", "112:48", "keep it floating or whatever", "112:50", "um it was over there there yeah oh no", "112:52", "that's not it that's", "112:55", "that's uh i think i think", "113:00", "i think that was a previous iteration of", "113:02", "the project and then he was kind of he", "113:03", "kind of refined it", "113:05", "that's a weird project man yeah it was a", "113:07", "really weird project and", "113:08", "what's even weirder is he decided to do", "113:10", "it in the middle of winter", "113:12", "so in the beginning he was like breaking", "113:13", "through the ice at the source of the", "113:15", "hudson to get", "113:16", "to get this homemade boat through the", "113:18", "thing but i can't", "113:20", "like we had some hairy moments in in", "113:22", "that week what's going on that guy's", "113:23",

"113:33", "distraction element there in his", "113:35", "his actions yeah he's probably", "113:37", "distracting himself from some other", "113:38", "things", "113:39", "but i really admire his you know uh", "113:43", "ability to take on that notion of kind", "113:45", "of reuse and waste and", "113:46", "what should be done with all these", "113:47", "materials i mean it's yeah yeah well we", "113:49", "certainly have an issue with that i mean", "113:51", "we certainly have an issue with", "113:52", "landfills our our", "113:53", "solution is stuff those things into the", "113:55", "ground and", "113:57", "the real problem with landfills is you", "113:58", "know we talk about", "114:00", "um the uh release of uh greenhouse gases", "114:05", "into uh the environment and the negative", "114:08", "effect it has", "114:10", "one of the biggest sources of greenhouse", "114:12", "gases is landfills", "114:14", "that i mean they're they're finding when", "114:16", "they did this um", "114:18", "they did like sort of a survey of the", "114:21", "like i forget how they did it but they", "114:23", "did it with i believe it was a satellite", "114:25", "where they looked at the earth from the", "114:27", "sky and tried to say", "114:29", "okay what where are these gases coming", "114:32", "from and what's the", "114:33", "the primary source of these gases and", "114:35", "they thought they would", "114:36", "be they thought it would be uh cattle", "114:39", "ranches", "114:40", "you know that these cattle were giving", "114:43", "off uh", "114:44", "methane and they found out no it doesn't", "114:47", "even compare", "114:48", "to landfills like landfills are just a", "114:50", "disaster", "114:51", "because it's all this biodegradable shit", "114:55", "that's stacked on top of each other and", "114:57", "it's just rotting", "114:59", "so it's rotting in this one area", "115:01", "concentrated", "115:02", "and it just just goes up into the sky", "115:04", "yeah we've got a family member that", "115:06", "actually works", "115:06", "he he does environmental monitoring for", "115:08", "landfills and he", "115:10", "yeah he was telling me that um they got", "115:13", "a call", "115:14", "at some point in this one landfill that", "115:16", "that there was a it was", "115:17", "it was smoking and so he drives over the", "115:20", "landfill and sure enough like", "115:21", "all of the all of the crap at the bottom", "115:23", "of the landfill that had been compressed", "115:25", "and compressed over time had turned into", "115:27", "a liquid and then had turned into a gas", "115:29", "and it sort of ignited somehow", "115:31", "yeah and so he had to", "115:34", "um uh inject something into the landfill", "115:38", "to basically put out this subterranean", "115:40", "fire", "115:41", "right and if there i mean if there's any", "115:43", "better indication of how we fucked", "115:45", "everything up", "115:46", "it's a it's a it's a subterranean fire", "115:48", "of", "115:50", "waste yeah well waste is a is a great", "115:54", "method of destruction and it actually", "115:56", "you can take that back to the native", "115:58", "americans", "115:58", "um they would do buffalo jumps you know", "116:01", "buffalo jumps yeah and when they would", "116:03", "they would corral these buffalo and", "116:06", "chase them off the side of a cliff", "116:08", "and when they would land in these great", "116:09", "big piles they would rot", "116:12", "and then they would they would combust", "116:15", "they would just burst into flames it's i", "116:17", "don't understand the", "116:19", "the whole mechanism behind it but it's", "116:21", "really common", "116:22", "that they would find these buffalo jumps", "116:25", "and", "116:26", "because of the fact they were all", "116:27", "rotting together in this great big pile", "116:30", "something would ignite and they would", "116:33", "burst into flames and so a lot of these", "116:35", "cliff sides where these buffalo jumps", "116:37", "are scarred", "116:39", "and charred with just blackened", "116:42", "soot and everything from these buffalo", "116:44", "just eventually catching on fire because", "116:46", "they you know they have no preservation", "116:48", "back then other than drying it and you", "116:50", "know when you're talking about hundreds", "116:51", "and hundreds of buffalo", "116:52", "there's really there's not much they can", "116:54", "do to preserve all the meat so there's a", "116:56", "tremendous amount of waste involved in", "116:57", "this method of", "116:58", "hunting yeah but no it's it's definitely", "117:00", "a myth that you know", "117:01", "native americans were at one with their", "117:03", "environment and they weren't having i", "117:04", "mean they were", "117:05", "you know when when you need to eat yeah", "117:07", "you're gonna you're gonna drive a", "117:09", "hundred buffalo off a cliff", "117:10", "you know and you might only use three of", "117:11", "them but there's two ways of looking at", "117:13", "that though", "117:14", "there's you could say oh it's very", "117:16", "wasteful but", "117:17", "also animals have to eat too coyotes", "117:19", "have to eat", "117:20", "uh bacteria has to eat nothing really", "117:22", "goes to waste yeah you think if coyotes", "117:24", "couldn't figure out how to how to corral", "117:26", "those buffalo off the cliff they", "117:28", "wouldn't do it they certainly would but", "117:30", "the the thing is that it is wasteful", "117:33", "in terms of the human being killing the", "117:35", "animal do they use all that animal no", "117:37", "they don't but", "117:39", "i think native americans looked at it", "117:41", "very differently than we did i think", "117:43", "they had a greater understanding of this", "117:45", "whole cycle of life", "117:46", "and even if you leave if they shot a", "117:49", "buffalo", "117:50", "and they took whatever meat that they", "117:51", "could carry and left that", "117:53", "the rest of it there hundreds of pounds", "117:55", "of meat that meat would", "117:57", "feed so many different animals some", "118:00", "bacteria it would eventually go into the", "118:02", "ground and feed the soil", "118:04", "it's it's only wasteful in terms of the", "118:06", "direct relationship between the person", "118:08", "that killed the buffalo and did they", "118:10", "consume that buffalo", "118:11", "but any animal that gets killed in the", "118:13", "wild does not go to waste", "118:15", "like if someone shoots a deer and they", "118:18", "uh maybe they they hit it and it only", "118:20", "hits one long and this deer can go a", "118:22", "mile and then dies and they can't find", "118:23", "it", "118:24", "well that did they wasted that deer", "118:27", "well the person who shot that deer does", "118:29", "not get to eat that deer", "118:30", "that is a problem but it's not a problem", "118:32", "in terms of the wild the wild will", "118:34", "consume that deer", "118:36", "100 there's no question whatsoever", "118:39", "there is no waste it will find a way to", "118:42", "not only the soil will absorb it animals", "118:45", "will find it crows will circle", "118:47", "that's one of the ways uh people find", "118:50", "carcasses is like", "118:51", "birds circling over carcasses you know", "118:54", "that's how you feel like if someone's", "118:55", "looking for someone that like", "118:56", "went missing it's one of the things they", "118:58", "look for they look for buzzards", "118:59", "or crows or birds flying in the air so", "119:03", "these american indians that did this in", "119:06", "our eyes they wasted all those animals", "119:08", "but", "119:08", "in their eyes probably not they probably", "119:10", "looked at it like we're staying alive", "119:12", "and the the great earth has", "119:16", "a use for all this it's gonna figure out", "119:18", "a way to make all this", "119:20", "it's gonna feed something yeah that", "119:22", "makes sense yeah", "119:23", "i think we just have this idea that like", "119:25", "if you shoot an animal you should eat", "119:27", "that whole animal and you definitely", "119:28", "should", "119:29", "but their their idea was this", "119:32", "i mean we we have to think i mean i got", "119:34", "really really obsessed with native", "119:36", "americans over the last like year", "119:39", "and i read uh seven or eight books on", "119:42", "them", "119:42", "and the what the world was like", "119:46",

things", "127:07", "were shifting", "127:08", "i mean i think that's where the that's", "127:10", "where the the archaeological", "127:12", "archaeological record is really", "127:13", "interesting

right and", "127:22", "there are", "127:22", "there's no oral history for well i'm", "127:24", "thinking of um", "127:26", "uh i i went to this site in uh in the", "127:29", "new", "127:29", "in the

these these people", "128:06", "disappeared", "128:07", "we don't know what happened to them", "128:08", "right but one of the theories that i", "128:10", "heard is that it was", "128:11", "it was a virus right that the it was it", "128:14", "was disease right and if you don't know", "128:16", "what it is", "128:18", "what do you do you're like well it's", "128:19", "something's attacking us

this with the bunker builders too", "128:29", "right that like all of these factions", "128:31", "and nuances and people with different", "128:33", "ideas about how to combat", "128:35", "the dread that we're all feeling right", "128:37", "now", "128:38", "and then if you were like if you were an", "128:39", "archaeologist in 100 years", "128:41", "and you excavated some of these bunker", "128:43", "sites you would find these", "128:45", "i mean incredibly different sites you", "128:47", "know places where people are growing", "128:49", "where they're um uh building kind of", "128:52",

like there's a future", "129:18", "interpretation of these that i'm", "129:21", "elucidating now right because a lot of", "129:23", "these communities don't", "129:25", "like let people in you know they don't", "129:26", "want people telling these stories right", "129:29", "so it did feel like i was writing", "129:31", "through a historical moment", "129:33", "um and that and that's before the", "129:35", "pandemic right", "129:37", "like i started this book in 2017. uh by", "129:40", "the time the pandemic hit i mean some of", "129:42", "the", "129:42", "some of the quotes in the book were",
