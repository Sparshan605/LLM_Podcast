know this idea that with high", "07:51", "insulin it just completely shuts down", "07:54", "all fat burning everywhere that's just", "07:56", "not true now if you have high", "07:57", "carbohydrate

my wife not uncommon", "08:46", "so fructose does seem to have a little", "08:49", "bit of different hepatic metabolism", "08:52", "but I was actually across the hall from", "08:54", "a professor who was doing a lot of the", "08:56", "research on on fructose and obesity and", "08:59", "fatty liver disease and even he came to", "09:01", "the conclusion that if you overfeed", "09:04", "fructose and

keep this right", "09:13", "next to your face sorry got it that's", "09:15", "what she says so powerful I talked about", "09:18", "and a lot it's good so if you're if", "09:22", "you're doing that if you're creating", "09:24", "that caloric surplus what you find is", "09:26", "when you're in net storage when you're", "09:29", "driving more nutrients into adipose and", "09:33", "sometimes liver depending on metabolism", "09:35", "but it takes it takes a lot of fructose", "09:38", "to do that and a caloric surplus you", "09:41", "start to create a lot of walky stuff", "09:43", "going on the mitochondria starts to", "09:45", "become dysfunctional and you know people", "09:47", "make a big deal about oh well you have", "09:49", "we have claimed now that everything", "09:52", "causes obesity and type 2 diabetes for", "09:55", "first it was fats then carbohydrates and", "09:59", "there's actually professors out there", "10:00", "who actually will claim that protein", "10:01",

"10:10", "state for everybody that I'm going out", "10:12", "on a limb this is my opinion okay if you", "10:14", "look at the research on obesity and", "10:18", "diabetes what happens is you have", "10:22", "everything start to elevate in the blood", "10:24", "stream so if you measure like there was", "10:26", "a professor who thought that branch", "10:27", "chain amino acids were causing obesity", "10:28", "because they were elevating the blood", "10:30", "stream during our sorry during type 2", "10:32", "diabetes well yeah branch chain amino", "10:34", "acids are elevated so fatty acids so try", "10:38", "cell glycerides", "10:39", "so is glucose so is it really those", "10:43", "things causing it or is it possible that", "10:45", "when you are over feeding relative to", "10:48", "what you burn relative to that turnover", "10:50", "that mitochondria start to become", "10:53", "dysfunctional probably a lot due to", "10:55", "inactivity and the mitochondria is as we", "11:00", "call the powerhouse of the cells you", "11:01", "probably learned in high school biology", "11:03", "or whatever they taught it to you as", "11:06", "that is where everything fluxes through", "11:08", "so that is where you're creating a", "11:09", "teepee", "11:10", "that's where you're burning through", "11:11", "lipids carbohydrates that sort of thing", "11:14", "if that becomes dysfunctional and you're", "11:17", "not getting enough flux enough pull", "11:19", "through that mitochondria what happens", "11:21", "is you start to back up every part of", "11:24", "metabolism so all the metabolic", "11:26", "byproducts almost all of them inhibit", "11:28", "everything within the cell there's a", "11:30", "metabolomics signature for that and and", "11:32", "epiphenomenon if you want to call it", "11:34", "that we elevated branched chain amino", "11:35", "acids so consequence of that and in some", "11:38", "people yeah so these things start these", "11:40", "byproducts these metabolic byproducts", "11:41", "because you're not flexing enough", "11:43", "through the cell they start accumulating", "11:45", "within the cell and start to inhibit the", "11:47", "Krebs cycle glycolysis and so everything", "11:49", "starts backing up to the point where you", "11:51", "also start inhibiting the insulin", "11:53", "receptor and now you have glucose fatty", "11:56", "acids and amino acids also backing up to", "11:59", "the point where they start to over spill", "12:01", "into the bloodstream and you see these", "12:04", "this accumulation of all of them in the", "12:07", "bloodstream in type 2 diabetes and I", "12:10", "actually think that again me going on a", "12:13", "limb that obesity doesn't cause type 2", "12:15", "diabetes and type 2 diabetes doesn't", "12:17", "cause obesity that they develop in", "12:19", "concert from the same problem which is", "12:22", "over feeding under activity hmm so a lot", "12:24", "of it is about how much nutrients you're", "12:27", "fluxing into cells versus how much", "12:29", "energy you're creating fluxing them", "12:31", "through the cell and out so when you're", "12:33", "overfeeding whether it be carbohydrate", "12:35", "fat you're flexing more energy in then", "12:38", "you can dispose of and now you have to", "12:41", "do something with it well when you run",

start", "12:53", "spilling into the bloodstream and now", "12:54", "you cause all kinds of problems so one", "12:57", "of the things that we really wanted to", "12:58", "talk about here is high carb

lot of", "13:16", "you know online experts and one of the", "13:19", "great thing about bringing you two guys", "13:21", "in here is because you could really", "13:22", "actually explain the science

"13:36", "that way that they like to portray a", "13:38", "ketogenic diet is this is it this is the", "13:40", "end-all be-all I figured out what to do", "13:42", "this is the way everyone should be", "13:44", "eating you don't think so I don't think", "13:47", "so because if you look at the weight", "13:50", "loss problem in our society and I'm", "13:53", "writing a book called fat loss forever",

take", "15:11", "studies that have similar parameters and", "15:13", "they kind of lump them together", "15:15", "and they look at ok what's the consensus", "15:17", "amongst these studies and they

maybe circle we have to find what", "16:37", "requires the least amount of discipline", "16:39", "for somebody to stick to because", "16:40", "discipline is is while some people have", "16:42", "more some people have less it is a", "16:46", "finite resource so when do we normally", "16:49", "find that people like to kind of drop", "16:51", "off whatever they're doing it's when", "16:53", "they're

do", "27:38", "it I love fatty food you know I've have", "27:41", "food low carb food but generally", "27:43", "speaking it's you know you have to", "27:46", "approach it from the perspective sort

right", "27:56", "yeah just want to cheat you want to just", "27:57", "stuff your face with cupcakes every now", "27:59", "and then and then you just you feel like", "28:01", "it's too much torture to keep yourself", "28:02", "on this narrow path of high fat low carb", "28:06", "moderate protein but you know five years", "28:08", "ago ten years ago that was the case but", "28:12", "now there's

know food technology is", "28:33", "evolving some of them no foods make some", "28:35", "good stuff go to go to keto nutrition", "28:37", "ORD and there are some things there", "28:39", "another I would say about 10 or 20", "28:40", "percent passed the test meaning that", "28:42", "they taste okay and they actually do", "28:44", "what they say they actually elevate", "28:46", "ketones", "28:48", "you know don't cause a glycemic response", "28:49", "some of those keto cookies seem like", "28:51", "they have no foundation like you bite in", "28:54", "they like they go away like as you're", "28:56", "eating them it's like they dissolve you", "28:58", "know they're not like you have like a", "28:59", "good Toll House cookie a good real", "29:02", "chocolate chip cookie and you bite into", "29:04", "that sucker you know it's bad for you", "29:06", "but god damn it feels good while it's", "29:08", "being you tried the quest protein", "29:10", "cookies yes they're pretty good yeah", "29:13", "they can't fuck with real cookies yeah", "29:15", "well I dip I dip them in like sour cream", "29:18", "right and then I eat them coconut cream", "29:20", "so that then it becomes a J you bring", "29:28", "that up interesting though if you look", "29:31", "at people that think they're addicted to", "29:33", "sugar or that sugars a lot if you look", "29:34", "at things like cookies and cakes you", "29:36", "know it's actually they have more", "29:38", "calories from fats than they do sugars", "29:40", "it's sugar and fat together is hyper", "29:42", "palatable right so we know one of the", "29:45", "things I was was gonna bring up is you", "29:48", "know this idea that sugar is so", "29:50", "inherently bad and you said the cookie", "29:52", "you know we view that as an inherently", "29:53", "bad thing", "29:54", "but what if I told you that there are", "29:56", "certain people not everybody everybody's", "29:58", "different but there are certain people", "29:59", "who if you tell them hey you can have", "30:02", "that cookie every once in a while if you", "30:03", "track it working into your macronutrient", "30:05", "intake that that's fine that that", "30:06", "actually improved their adherence to", "30:08", "diet so because you give them a reward", "30:11", "no not a reward system you're not a dog", "30:13", "don't reward yourself out okay because", "30:16", "because increased flexibility actually", "30:19", "usually improves adherence so we see", "30:22", "this actually with training to athletes", "30:24", "are when you do a flexible

are a little bit", "30:32", "they actually do better diet is very", "30:34", "similar to that so now you always have", "30:38", "to sacrifice something in order to if", "30:41", "you want to lose

and", "31:05", "fat targets now what you're sacrificing", "31:06", "is okay you're tracking every day do you", "31:09", "find that through an app through what an", "31:11", "app uh no I'm old school I actually just", "31:13", "do it through Excel I've got my", "31:16", "girlfriend Holly she has an app on her", "31:18", "phone and like she she has me like if", "31:21", "she's driving sick Oh were you put in", "31:22", "when I just ate I'm like baby I don't", "31:24", "even I know I had no idea how to work", "31:26", "this thing you know so because when I", "31:30", "went to do my graduate

basically a hundred percent of", "49:49", "that is going into your system and it's", "49:51", "causing a hormonal response so the food", "49:55", "that we eat creates it's not only", "49:58",

up", "50:16", "on hormones and and if you look at the", "50:19", "research data it just doesn't support it", "50:21", "like with insulin what no no I went in", "50:22", "terms of like losing weight and your", "50:24", "your what happens with leptin and", "50:26", "ghrelin and all those kinds of things", "50:27", "that is a huge one of the one of the", "50:29", "things we talked about before the", "50:31", "podcast started we had about thirty", "50:32", "minute podcast yeah you know people say", "50:37", "things like one of the piet reasons", "50:39", "people are really mistrustful of kind of", "50:41", "the calories in calories out model is", "50:43", "because it is viewed as a two isolated", "50:48", "variables calories in and calories that", "50:50", "are separate that's not

what", "51:01", "you thought was a calorie", "51:02", "deficit and you didn't lose weight but", "51:04", "if you didn't lose weight it was not a", "51:06", "calorie deficit by definition okay so", "51:09", "it's you're retaining water or something", "51:10", "yeah whose will we look at dieting like", "51:14", "just dieting in general over time lowers", "51:17", "your metabolic rate right so if you take", "51:20", "somebody they actually did a rat study", "51:21", "again rats but rats tend to respond", "51:23", "pretty similar to humans into would you", "51:25", "agree with that in terms of blood I mean", "51:27", "you do a lot of rats is a lot of rats", "51:28", "and mouse studies yeah I think there's a", "51:31", "lot of good mother lap there yeah", "51:34", "so again but we have to put that out", "51:36", "there because we want to we don't want", "51:37", "to oversell it", "51:38", "they did a depends on the context of", "51:40", "where you're studying of course yeah", "51:42",

can", "75:51", "we do a little bit more fiber like I", "75:53", "think in general you know I criticize", "75:55", "paleo diets because I think they're", "75:57", "validation for their model is

you said well you", "111:34", "work with these kind of metabolically", "111:36", "elite people so what are the problems I", "111:39", "say what you're doing where you kind of", "111:41", "take

my", "160:53", "fourth session then I iced bath or", "160:55", "something I'm not worried about growing", "160:57", "muscle in that time I'm worried about", "160:58", "getting recovered enough that I

gonna take him out", "161:32", "that necessarily but I always want to", "161:34", "give context because people hear these", "161:36", "things and they always think it's a", "161:37", "positive like in

will enhance your readiness your", "161:51", "resilience and your recovery so from a", "161:54", "military perspective too I believe", "161:57", "and and that needs to be validated and", "161:59", "studied but something that that we study", "162:01", "when you I'm sorry to review but when", "162:03", "you advise this to the military do they", "162:05", "do you put them on a specific meal plan", "162:07", "- or do they have it's more like grants", "162:11", "were this is being studied at a very", "162:12", "fundamental very controlled level from", "162:15", "cells to animal models to you know human", "162:18", "clinical trials going on and where the", "162:20", "data is being collected now and some of", "162:22", "it is taken empirically and anecdotally", "162:25", "from the field or just from various", "162:27", "exclusive channels I guess I would say", "162:29", "so that I am coming at it as a biased", "162:32", "and I'm kind of speaking ahead of the", "162:34", "science but I do think that science", "162:37", "already exists showing that you have a", "162:41", "greater adaptive effect if just by", "162:44", "virtue of lowering inflammation over", "162:45", "time in athletes especially this", "162:48", "probably pertains more to endurance", "162:50", "athletes so it really needs to be", "162:51", "studied and in resistance try and MMA", "162:54", "fighters and things like that so there", "162:56", "was a recent study and I can't remember", "162:58", "the researchers name I'll send it to you", "162:59", "I had a lot of criticisms of it but they", "163:01", "did show that ketogenic person on", "163:04", "ketogenic diet in people who were", "163:06", "lifting weights trying to get bigger", "163:08", "that there was actually slightly less", "163:11", "muscle mass using the ketogenic diet do", "163:13", "you think that would be because of the", "163:14", "less protein no they equated protein I'm", "163:17", "pretty sure I want to say they equated", "163:19", "protein now I don't know for sure so I", "163:22", "don't want to say authoritative day but", "163:24", "I understand ketosis you're gonna have", "163:26", "these did they adjust for calories I", "163:29", "believe they did so again I could be", "163:31", "wrong and so I'll go back and look and", "163:33", "I'll send it to you if you want it but", "163:36", "it is possible like again for every give", "163:39", "me there's a gotcha in certain things", "163:40", "right so like these things that activate", "163:43", "different pathways well part of what", "163:45", "ketones may signal as a deficit because", "163:47", "usually you don't have them in a surplus", "163:49", "right so you know man we don't know if", "163:53", "you can like for example like a tofu G", "163:56", "right like for if we talk about", "163:57", "performance and muscle everybody here is", "164:00", "a toughie G and that's a very other way", "164:01", "that's such a weird way to pronounce", "164:02", "that because it's Auto and phagocytosis", "164:05", "so it shouldn't be Auto Fei Jie but", "164:07", "anyway it's a very rapidly", "164:10", "merging science and Naomi would tell", "164:12", "wrote a book about this and it just it's", "164:14", "like a New York Times and that really", "164:16", "covers a science so license last two or", "164:18", "three years yeah lysosomal remodeling", "164:20", "and degradation of proteins but very hot", "164:23", "what what gets me is like people who are", "164:25", "a big on intermittent fasting they'll", "164:27", "say well increases at offer G but you", "164:29", "also they're also saying you can grow", "164:31", "all this muscle and it's going to be", "164:32", "best for you know building muscle but", "164:34", "that's not true because Auto fizzy tough", "164:36", "og is part of protein degradation so if", "164:38", "you're increasing that system by", "164:40", "definition that's less muscle so your", "164:43", "there's always a give me Anna gotcha for", "164:45", "one benefit there might be a drawback", "164:47", "now depending on your individual", "164:48", "situation maybe it makes more sense", "164:50", "right like having the most muscle mass", "164:53", "possible may not be the best thing for", "164:55", "health now we know that having having", "164:58", "more muscle mass than normal is good for", "165:00", "health", "165:00", "but may be having like absolute peak", "165:02", "muscle mass may not be the best thing", "165:04", "for help yeah you know so it's like", "165:06", "that's why I was trying to say earlier", "165:07", "there's never gonna be one diet that", "165:10", "just fixes all of our problems it", "165:12", "depends on the individual and what", "165:14", "they're trying to get out of it just", "165:16", "like if I went to and again I'm not it", "165:19", "have much I watched MMA for years loved", "165:22", "your commentary that's where I learned a", "165:23", "lot of stuff about him and MMA but if I", "165:26", "went to a Brazilian jiu-jitsu instructor", "165:27", "and I said what's the best technique", "165:29", "he's gonna look at me like I'm an idiot", "165:31", "right because you're not just not just", "165:34", "gonna say yeah armbar every time that's", "165:37", "the best technique for you Jitsu and", "165:38", "that's when people say what's the best", "165:40", "diet it's the same thing", "165:41", "right it's completely contextual", "165:43", "dependent right depends on you and in", "165:46", "the case of ma it depends on your", "165:47", "opponent as well what your goals are", "165:48", "yeah strategies so interact --ax I think", "165:51", "what we were trying to really emphasize", "165:53", "is that individuality dependent but also", "165:56", "I really want to emphasize that they", "165:58", "show us calories matter you know", "165:59", "calories matter even in even if you're", "166:02", "eating low carb you can't just eat as", "166:05", "much as you want and the mopar B is a", "166:08", "very viable option yes you induce and", "166:12", "sustain a calorie deficit that can", "166:15", "contribute to body composition but even", "166:17", "like you brought up Floyd Mayweather", "166:19", "earlier which I thought was great", "166:20", "because you said he drinks a coke after", "166:21", "training", "166:22", "well it's hard to argue with his

great because he ate this", "167:04", "way or can he eat this way because he's", "167:06", "this great athlete it's probably the", "167:08", "latter right so we wouldn't recommend", "167:11", "like
