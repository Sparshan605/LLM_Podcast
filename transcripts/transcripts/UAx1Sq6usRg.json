you know I did music for", "28:47", "most of my life with the youth of today", "28:49", "you thought today was the band before", "28:53", "I became a monk and then I and at the", "28:56", "height of that career this was a New", "28:57", "York City", "28:58", "hardcore straight edge band we didn't", "29:01", "drink we didn't smoke and we you know", "29:04", "we're all strict vegetarians", "29:06", "oh that's me yeah the more relaxed form", "29:14", "so that's what I did as and and the idea", "29:18", "of the band were teenagers we're all", "29:21", "teenagers me and my bed buddy parm", "29:23", "Ananda who also later moved into an", "29:25", "ashram so we started this when we were", "29:28", "in 1617 and there's a cool scene making", "29:36", "our own music and stuff like that but", "29:37", "when we got youth of today together it", "29:39", "was about sort of a message of better", "29:43", "living positive mental attitude these", "29:46", "spiritual principles like karma and what", "29:49", "goes around comes around and respect", "29:53", "dignity controlling your senses in your", "29:57", "mind and what what led you to that no", "30:00", "really no I've always been interested in", "30:04", "my idea of a good time was this was like", "30:07", "80s in New York City was you find these", "30:09", "like eesti West ebook stores that have", "30:12", "books on yoga and metaphysics and", "30:14", "reincarnation and just plop it down and", "30:17", "read books all afternoon by Swami's and", "30:19", "sadhus and weirdos and palm readers and", "30:23", "stuff like that that's my idea of what a", "30:24", "good time was and I always felt like", "30:26", "life is meant for our self edification", "30:30", "that's why we're here we're here on a", "30:32", "mission of growth and when I and when I", "30:36", "read books by sages or mystics and", "30:38", "things like that I was always like I", "30:39", "want to be like that that's what I want", "30:42", "to be that's bigger than anything out", "30:44", "there that I want to be so truthfully", "30:46", "the band I never really want I'm not a", "30:48", "musician I play a little bit of", "30:49", "everything I wrote all the songs but I", "30:51", "always looked at myself as more like a", "30:53", "seeker and it made me a spokesperson but", "30:56", "then at a certain point in the success", "30:58", "of that band I started realizing okay", "31:02", "now we're big and there's a lot of", "31:04", "people who are following those", "31:06", "sort of principles of controlling your", "31:08", "senses we don't drink we don't smoke", "31:09", "here", "31:10", "we don't take drugs we're you know we", "31:12", "can care about what we eat but that's", "31:15", "not the goal that's like a doorway to", "31:17", "something bigger and so for me I had to", "31:20", "step away from that even though it", "31:22", "wasn't bad or anything it wasn't what I", "31:26", "wanted to become and that it was a", "31:28", "certain point in my life you know you", "31:31", "get to a certain end of a chapter in", "31:33", "your life and it for me in at the time", "31:35", "was the height of the Bands career as", "31:37", "well we started touring internationally", "31:39", "and stuff like that but I realized there", "31:42", "was no amount and and by the way this", "31:44", "was 80s in New York which is a very cool", "31:46",

"31:57", "inspiration and they were your friends", "31:58", "and stuff like that", "32:00", "so at that height and excitement I just", "32:05", "said there is no amount of like material", "32:08", "success I want that's gonna fill sort of", "32:12", "like a god-shaped hole in my heart", "32:14", "there's nothing out there that I want", "32:16", "and it was it was also a very precarious",

about", "32:32", "it", "32:33", "what happened was he got some unknown", "32:35", "lung infection was young", "32:38", "64 the unknown lung infection and there", "32:42", "was some neglect in the
