up and", "03:55", "Connor was just dead yeah well I heard I", "03:56", "mean people were talking to Nate about", "03:57", "because you know going into that fight", "03:59", "like Connors power was

but what what's", "05:06", "fascinating to me is that he wanted to", "05:09", "jump right back in there and do it again", "05:10", "and that Nate wanted or that Conor", "05:13", "wanted to just run it back and it's like", "05:15", "wow that's interesting it seems weird", "05:17", "that he gets to do that not so much that", "05:19", "he wants to but it just seems weird that", "05:21", "they were like like you know when Dana", "05:23", "White was talking about in his like look", "05:24", "man we tried to convince him to go down", "05:25", "to 145 and he was like Nate's field I", "05:27", "was

"05:41", "emperor has been stripped down okay so", "05:44", "now he's exposed so now someone's beaten", "05:46", "him so here's the thing what do you do", "05:49", "now you want to make money okay because", "05:51", "if you want to make money make the", "05:52", "biggest fight you can right now while", "05:54", "he's been exposed and the biggest fight", "05:56", "for sure is when I say expose I don't", "05:58", "mean he's not talented", "05:59", "I mean exposed meaning he's a human and", "06:01", "he can lose and that happens with every", "06:03", "fighter they lose and once they lose", "06:05", "people go oh you can be beat you know we", "06:09", "saw it with Anderson Silva you saw with", "06:11", "Mike Tyson when after Mike Tyson fought", "06:13", "Buster Douglas it was a different world", "06:14", "everybody was like oh oh he's human so I", "06:18", "say exposed not in a disrespectful way", "06:19", "but got exposed", "06:21", "he lost get choked out he got beaten up", "06:23", "on the ground and then he got choked out", "06:24", "quick so this is not an invulnerable", "06:27", "perfect fighter who's unbelievably", "06:29", "durable right who can take punishment", "06:31", "like no man there's a lot of those guys", "06:33", "in the UFC", "06:34", "there's champions like that in the UFC", "06:35", "that like Robbie Lawler unbelievably", "06:38", "durable you can't put him a", "06:39", "way it's fucking hard to put that guy", "06:42", "away we're not talking about that we're", "06:43", "talking about a guy who got dinged up", "06:45", "shot for a shitty wide open takedown got", "06:47", "taken down got demolished on the ground", "06:49", "and got choked unconscious quickly", "06:51", "afterwards so all right what do you do", "06:53", "could that happen with dos Anjos fuck", "06:56", "yeah it could dos on just could do that", "06:58", "too it's possible I mean Conor might not", "07:00", "come out you never know Conor does have", "07:01", "that punch but you gotta put him in", "07:04", "against Nate again because that's the", "07:05", "big-money rematch and if if this guy", "07:08", "turns out to be a guy who's gonna win", "07:10", "some and lose some and the beginning of", "07:13", "his career this unbeatable wild Celtic", "07:15", "Warrior character right that's all gone", "07:18", "but he's champ he still got a belt at", "07:19", "145 yeah so it's almost kind of a right", "07:22", "a weird position for now but I mean", "07:24", "here's my question is when I say for now", "07:26", "can you really keep making that wait", "07:28", "that's what I'm saying well I I've", "07:30", "wondered about that too I've had some", "07:31", "people have argued with me saying like", "07:32", "no he can make the weight because he was", "07:34", "he was was in 169 against Nia so they're", "07:37", "saying he basically that's what he", "07:38", "starts at he can just cut down from", "07:39", "there that's a lot but look what he", "07:42", "looked like at the at the weigh-in so", "07:43", "maybe you can I mean he kind he", "07:45", "definitely can do it it's physically", "07:47", "possible I was so looking forward to the", "07:50", "press conference though just because I", "07:52", "can't you know you've got this guy in", "07:54", "Connor who's like the ultimate shit", "07:56", "talker and then you've got Nate who I", "07:58", "mean the first the dynamic at the first", "08:00", "press conference was amazing yeah it was", "08:01", "amazing and at that moment when he was", "08:04", "just like kind of talking circles around", "08:05", "Nate and they just broke and he goes how", "08:07", "about this fuck you fuck your belt fuck", "08:10", "this press conference like they just", "08:11", "went to hang stir on him yeah but now", "08:14", "like how can Connor I was so interested", "08:16", "like how can he show up and talk shit", "08:18", "like that yeah when Nate's got the", "08:20", "perfect rebuttal that anything he has to", "08:22", "say I beat John this today's cosmic", "08:23", "saying all kinds of crazy stuff like the", "08:25", "first eight minutes were easy yeah", "08:27", "oh by mmm yeah but here's the difference", "08:30", "between the first day the last three", "08:32", "minutes the last three were a lot worse", "08:34", "yeah they were awful like you got fucked", "08:36", "up man you got to just accept that but", "08:39", "that's part of his thing is that he has", "08:41", "to like look at things in the most", "08:44", "positive light possible and man I don't", "08:47", "know", "08:48", "I think stylistically it's a troublesome", "08:50", "fight for him because Nate is a very", "08:52", "clever boxer and his ground", "08:53", "game is a world away from where Connor", "08:56", "is right now and I've seen Nate roll", "08:58", "with guys he's a fucking legit very", "09:01", "high-level Brazilian jiu-jitsu black", "09:03", "belt under a very respected camp his", "09:05", "cardio is outstanding his boxing is", "09:07", "nasty so where's Connor shining the only", "09:09", "way I think I mean I guess there's a you", "09:11", "know it's really hard to like fight a", "09:13", "Diaz brother and beat them usually when", "09:15", "people beat them it's kind of like", "09:17", "they're they really stick to a strategy", "09:18", "you got to kind of take them down and", "09:20", "avoid submissions or like leg kick and", "09:22", "circle like dos Anjos beat them up in", "09:25", "that way but you know what there's also", "09:27", "different show up well there's also you", "09:29", "know different camps you know you're", "09:31", "coming in who knows what kind of fucking", "09:33", "injuries you're dealing with you know", "09:34", "you see a guy like Nate come in and look", "09:37", "really kind of lackadaisical against", "09:39", "half of those on just den you see him", "09:42", "come back and look shredded against", "09:44", "Michael Johnson and look sensational", "09:46", "so you go okay that's what he's capable", "09:47", "of when he's on and focused you got to", "09:49", "be ready for that guy and I think yeah", "09:51", "that's the best he's ever look at", "09:52", "Michael Johnson fight yeah you can't", "09:53", "think that the guy who lost dos Anjos is", "09:55", "showing up you got to think the guy that", "09:57", "came out swarmed cowboy in the first", "09:59", "round is coming like that that guy is a", "10:01", "clever fucking boxer so where does Conor", "10:04", "shine knockout power that's where he", "10:06", "shines like Connor can dead dudes yeah", "10:08", "but but he couldn't do is yeah they're", "10:11", "tough to hit they have great head", "10:12", "movement and green chins and they they", "10:13", "roll with punches well the only guy to", "10:15", "ever stop Nate was Josh Thompson and", "10:18", "Josh did it with a brutal head kick and", "10:19", "Josh Thompson to this day I say is one", "10:21", "of the most underrated guys he just the", "10:25", "stars did not align for him but he could", "10:27", "have easily been a UFC champion he was", "10:29", "champ in a start horse yeah and with", "10:31", "Gilbert and him and Gilbert went back", "10:32", "and forth you know Josh Thompson's", "10:35", "world-class fighters so when Josh", "10:36", "Thompson head kicked him you know it's", "10:38", "like Josh to do that to anybody in that", "10:39", "division if he catches you you know", "10:41", "you're fucked he sees the older now and", "10:43", "he's just yeah I think he's a guy that", "10:46", "like like I said the stars didn't like", "10:48", "perfectly aligned for but like skill", "10:50", "wise and technique wise he's a fucking", "10:52", "world-class fighter so when he knocked", "10:54", "out Nate Diaz it's not necessarily an", "10:57", "indication that Nate Diaz is done", "10:58", "because just you know that's how good", "11:00", "Josh Thompson is yeah and at the time", "11:02", "and then so Nate rebounds from that and", "11:04", "I think people you look at like the", "11:06", "losses", "11:07", "the dos anjos fight and you look at that", "11:09", "the Josh Thompson fight and you go hmm", "11:11", "how good is he you know I could beat", "11:13", "that guy but then you look at the", "11:15", "Michael Johnson fighting Oh whoo that", "11:17", "that guy's fucking dangerous", "11:18", "Jay Miller Cerrone exact a lot of these", "11:21", "fighters just unbelievable yeah uh and I", "11:24", "think uh it's one of those things where", "11:26", "styles make fights and you know kind of", "11:28", "really got in people's heads by talking", "11:30", "shit and I felt like going and I was", "11:31", "like I think you're gonna get Nate's", "11:32", "head by talking shit he's not that guy", "11:34", "yeah how about this Mike will fuck up", "11:36", "your whole crew that's the most gangster", "11:38", "thing you could say by the way that's", "11:40", "the most gangster thing cuz he's", "11:41", "literally
