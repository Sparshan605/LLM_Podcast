sure there's a", "83:12", "lot of reasons that go into why the", "83:15", "delay has been so long but when you have", "83:19", "a project like that there's always going", "83:21", "to be time for me

quickly than those guys", "83:32", "like to write so their process is very", "83:38", "analytical and I think you know at some", "83:39", "point maybe because so much time is", "83:41", "going by with from the last album there", "83:46", "has to be some little bit of fear in", "83:49", "there you know you've got like has or", "83:50", "it's this record gonna be as good as the", "83:53", "last one", "83:54", "you know the anticipation now is now the", "83:56", "pressure is huge so I'm sure there's", "83:58", "some of that goes into play but as far", "84:01", "as the way that Danny and Adam and", "84:04", "Justin right it's a very very tedious", "84:08", "long process and they're always going", "84:11", "back over things and questioning what", "84:13", "they did and stepping back and going", "84:14", "back farther and going forward and in a", "84:16", "way it's like they're they're laying a", "84:19", "foundation they're putting in the", "84:20", "footings for a house so I can't write I",

they're just like I'm", "87:54", "getting shit done like right you're", "87:55", "either in my way are you gonna help me", "87:57", "or you gonna get the fuck out of my way", "87:58", "but I'm getting shit done and so you're", "88:00", "like okay I can't get shit done over", "88:02", "here I'm gonna get shit done over here", "88:03", "I'm gonna go do this I'm gonna start a", "88:05", "wine company

hey", "88:52", "Justin send me send me the track see", "88:56", "where we're at is this thing done if", "88:59", "this thing is done done done and I can", "89:01", "start writing words and music on it", "89:04", "great but I've had instances where I", "89:06", "started to write stuff and by the time I", "89:08", "actually got it around and back and", "89:10", "we're actually listening and whatever", "89:12", "the talk had gone in a completely", "89:15", "different direction so everything that", "89:17", "was written melody wise or lyric wise", "89:20", "was completely irrelevant now I have to", "89:21", "start over", "89:22", "is that weird because you guys aren't in", "89:23", "the same location physically right right", "89:25", "I mean I can sit there in that room and", "89:28",

for", "90:00", "them to do it for me I can I can move", "90:02", "much more quickly if you'll let if", "90:03", "you'll let me help you I've done you", "90:04", "know I've written a few songs in fact I", "90:07", "was involved in many of them the ones", "90:09", "that we've done so we could do that but", "90:12", "I think this is what this is what they", "90:15", "need to do and I'm okay with it I you", "90:19", "know you got to get a little friction in", "90:21", "there's had to come in and you know and", "90:23", "puff my chest out a little bit and be", "90:25", "aggressive and let's fucking let's move", "90:27", "it guys let's move it and that works for", "90:30", "a minute and we we definitely make", "90:32", "traction but if I were to do that every", "90:34", "day it would just become a part of the", "90:36", "friction more friction rather than", "90:39", "actually getting anything done it seems", "90:40", "like one of the biggest problems with", "90:42", "bands right is just getting to", "90:43", "personalities together yeah yeah yeah", "90:45", "yeah yeah we're definitely very strong", "90:46", "for very strong personalities you know", "90:51", "same with Billy working with Billy with", "90:53", "perfect circle he gets a little forest", "90:56", "for trees sometimes and I'm like the guy", "90:59", "go on what what they step back look at", "91:02", "it and then I'm out the door for poor", "91:06", "guys go home heard you go and them you", "91:11", "know working with Matt Mitchell and", "91:12", "Karina and in Puscifer we all generally", "91:17", "work with or for other projects and", "91:20", "other people so when we get together we", "91:23", "are fucking streamline organized we go", "91:26", "okay I'll check in with the guys and", "91:30", "tool and go okay where we at what do we", "91:31", "got", "91:32", "are we there is it like are we gonna", "91:34", "track tomorrow because we're gonna track", "91:35", "tomorrow I can tell you great then this",

"while we're tell me when that day is", "91:50", "right when we're when we're ready to", "91:52", "start when these are done I can take my", "91:54", "time to write on I I mean and you know", "91:58", "fairness I should take my ten years to", "92:00", "write lyrics now but I won't do that", "92:02", "right I'll I'll digest these things as", "92:05", "quickly as I can and and and keep that", "92:07", "moment that freshness of what my", "92:10", "impressions are of the finished tracks", "92:11", "and we'll start but nothing's you know", "92:13", "nothing is tracked yet nothing is", "92:16", "completely finished answer a couple", "92:17", "songs that I think are finished now I", "92:19", "can start working on those but nothing's", "92:22", "actually recorded there's just all",

"92:35", "done in the interim so there's there's", "92:37", "more you know when you write something", "92:39", "like say if you have an idea if you're", "92:40", "just sitting around you're like I have a", "92:41", "thought do you just sit down and you go", "92:44", "okay there's a tool song this is a", "92:46", "perfect circle song this is a Puscifer", "92:47", "song does it just like no because what", "92:50", "I'm what I'm writing to is is the music", "92:53", "that I'm hearing from those people so", "92:55", "that's all you write to I write to the", "92:57", "music because that way it's a unique", "92:58", "it's a unique island situation those", "93:01", "things are gonna whenever I've tried to", "93:02", "write I've had some poetry sitting over", "93:04", "here that I want to write mm-hmm and I", "93:06", "tried to a force it on to a song for any", "93:10", "of those projects it doesn't work it", "93:13", "doesn't it doesn't it doesn't seem to", "93:14", "fit so you need to hear the song I need", "93:18", "to hear the finished thing you know if", "93:19", "it almost finished thing and then put", "93:21", "lyrics to it yeah yeah get them get the", "93:24", "melodies in place get the rhythms as if", "93:26", "I'm an instrument and is that how you", "93:27", "guys did that Fibonacci song yeah yeah", "93:30", "Wow yeah that was a really unique", "93:33", "undertaking how what was the process", "93:35", "behind that like did you did you say hey", "93:37", "it would be a nifty idea I do something", "93:40", "to a mathematical sequence no no that", "93:43", "was a complete accident I think it was I", "93:45", "think Adam or Justin who had the riff", "93:49", "and at some point they were actually", "93:51", "counting counting the riff and it ended", "93:54", "up being in seven eight nine I think I", "93:56", "was like I said a measure of seven a", "93:59", "measure of", "94:00", "measure of 9 and I'm not sure how you", "94:01", "would actually write that out as a and", "94:05", "note and notation but um you know I", "94:09", "think 789 is a Fibonacci number just", "94:15", "that you know the actual 789 mm thick I", "94:18", "think I look at again it might be 980", "94:21", "some people don't know what the fuck", "94:22", "we're talking about the Fibonacci", "94:23", "sequence is a very unique mathematical", "94:26", "sequence that appears in nature it's uh", "94:28", "it's in fractals it's in sunflowers if", "94:32", "you look at like the pattern of", "94:33", "sunflower seeds if you look at Nautilus", "94:35", "shells and what it is it's an expanding", "94:38", "fractal sort of a mathematical equation", "94:40", "I don't know if I'm saying it correctly", "94:42", "but it's like the first step is 0 and", "94:44", "then there's 1 and then 1 1 2 3 5 to 2", "94:48", "plus yeah and it just keeps going on so", "94:50", "that's the that's the Fibonacci number", "94:52", "like write a whole number like actual", "94:55", "number sequence there's there's the Phi", "94:58", "ratio where points 1.618", "95:01", "anything multiplied by the one point six", "95:03", "pointed that that herb not not", "95:05", "multiplied the relationship the", "95:08", "difference the difference in the length", "95:10", "from this finger to this finger as", "95:14", "opposed to this finger that thing those", "95:16", "those knuckles and your digits those are", "95:19", "all in that in that relationship of", "95:21", "1.618 the Phi relationship so that the", "95:24", "fractals as it's growing that", "95:27", "progression is is that is that ratio and", "95:31", "then the number breakdown is as you said", "95:33", "it's 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 yo so likes 1 plus 1", "95:39", "is 2 2 plus 1 is 3 3 plus 2 is 5 5 plus", "95:43", "3 is 8 and it's like everything you you", "95:45", "count you add what came before it and a", "95:48", "spiral picture like of Giza Plateau", "95:50", "showing you them well also facial", "95:53", "structure which is really fascinating", "95:54", "there's something about human facial", "95:57", "structure that uses the Fibonacci", "95:59", "sequence and I read something where", "96:01", "about why people recognize plastic", "96:04", "surgery while it disturbs them boom yeah", "96:06", "it's like what's going on with the", "96:08", "sequence like the sequence is off so my", "96:10", "friend here it is the Fibonacci", "96:12", "relationships of the human", "96:14", "had and it's all I had a friend who said", "96:16", "you know how when you know a you know of", "96:19", "a family has had a child who has Down", "96:21", "syndrome right there's there's a it", "96:24", "crosses racial divides it just you can", "96:27", "tell this this family has had that that", "96:30", "child has Down syndrome", "96:31", "there's no look that goes along with it", "96:33", "they said it's the same look you know", "96:35", "not the same look but like it's the same", "96:37", "recognition of people who have had", "96:40", "facial plastic surgery mmm you recognize", "96:43", "you're not fooling anybody your honor", "96:45", "you've done a thing that's recognizable", "96:47", "universally as wrong something's wrong", "96:50", "with your sons isn't it isn't off yeah", "96:52", "it's off yeah but I thought it was funny", "96:54", "that it was actually connecting it to", "96:56", "down no disrespect to people with Down", "96:58", "syndrome but yeah I know what you're", "97:00", "saying yeah yeah but but it is like when", "97:03", "you see someone with the disease like oh", "97:04", "there's clearly an error here in the", "97:06", "code yes yeah and the end of facial", "97:09", "reconstruct the plastic surgery because", "97:12", "I'm just oh shit I'm getting older you", "97:14", "just a fool them well the nose thing too", "97:16", "is weird like when someone has a", "97:18", "uniquely small nose and they're in the", "97:20", "face you know but they might have a long", "97:22", "like Ari Shaffir type face but then they", "97:24", "have this like shrunken down nose like", "97:26", "hey yeah like this seems fucked right", "97:29", "this doesn't there's a ratio that's", "97:31", "supposed to exist it doesn't exist why", "97:33", "your lips but you know you know in a in", "97:36", "a in a way a song like Lata Ellis with", "97:39", "the Fibonacci thing that's that's I feel", "97:42", "like I kind of pulled a very pedestrian", "97:46", "sophomoric move by including those", "97:50", "numbers in there because in general", "97:52", "music is the fire ratio everything", "97:56", "everything that all nature all these", "97:57", "things we're talking about it's already", "97:59", "here by by pointing it out like staring", "98:03", "at it and pointing at it with those", "98:04", "numbers present and the way that the", "98:07", "numbers and the lyrics are I feel like", "98:10", "that you know it's good to let people", "98:12", "know about it but I almost feel like it", "98:14", "was kind of a it was kind of a dick joke", "98:15", "you know way it's it's um I could do", "98:20", "better that's interesting", "98:22", "are you one of those ruthlessly", "98:23", "introspective gods just yeah probably so", "98:27", "probably so buddies any good at anything", "98:29", "does that yeah no other way around good", "98:32", "thing good thing I'm not good at", "98:34", "anything it's almost like you have a", "98:35", "guard dog that you turn on yourself", "98:36", "yeah sit you know what I mean it's like", "98:41", "you know I figure out what's wrong with", "98:43", "me", "98:43", "get him I mean me get me and then you uh", "98:45", "yeah fire you're fucked", "98:48", "I'm my own guard dog one shot to the", "98:51", "dome I break the guard I punched through", "98:55", "the guard my shots go through your guard", "98:57", "keep your hands up you're fucked", "99:05", "everyone's fucked yeah that's um that's", "99:10", "a characteristic that I see in almost", "99:13", "everybody that I respect they all think", "99:16", "that everything they do sucks or at", "99:18", "least they have very very high standards", "99:20", "and an often disappointed by their own", "99:22", "work well you know I think I have some", "99:25", "of that but I also have that idea of", "99:27", "like it's something that my thought I", "99:30", "don't fight talked about my dad with you", "99:32", "but um he was my wrestling coach in high", "99:35", "school he was also my science biology", "99:39", "and environmental studies teacher really", "99:41", "she was my teacher oh what a drag went", "99:43", "to school your dad being the T doesn't", "99:45", "fucking but I learned a lot because he", "99:47", "was no joke he didn't pull any punches", "99:49", "for me he you know he drove me as hard", "99:51", "if not harder than his other students", "99:54", "you didn't show any favoritism but one", "99:56", "of the things that was always his thing", "99:57", "on the mat and I'm kind of paraphrasing", "99:59", "but basically you you either win or you", "100:04", "learn mm-hmm especially in that high", "100:06", "school college setting you're you're", "100:08", "you're learning about yourself if you if", "100:10", "you went out there and you got your ass", "100:12", "handed to you then you just got beat and", "100:15", "didn't learn anything well yeah you're a", "100:17", "fucking loser", "100:17", "you take the moment reflect on it build", "100:21", "on what you did wrong and you now you're", "100:24", "actually in a way you've won if now you", "100:26", "know more about yourself you know about", "100:28", "more your your limitations or what you", "100:30", "need to improve and expand your talents", "100:33", "your your limitations so I guess", "100:35", "whenever I'm doing a thing I'm always", "100:37", "looking at it for", "100:38", "a learning perspective so there aren't", "100:41", "necessarily mistakes unless they're", "100:43", "fatal and then you wouldn't know anyway", "100:45", "so whatever that really is the right way", "100:48", "to look at everything you win or you", "100:50", "learn yeah you know you have great", "100:52", "experiences because you're successful or", "100:54", "you have very beneficial experiences", "100:57", "because you realized what went wrong", "100:59", "yeah but you just one more wrinkled one", "101:02", "more piece of information or one more", "101:04", "experience that you can add to your", "101:06", "database of knowledge and it'll make you", "101:08", "better at
