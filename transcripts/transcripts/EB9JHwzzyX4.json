"15:50", "mean I talked to for my last book", "15:52", "talking about the Eric garner case I", "15:54", "talked to lots of cops and they they", "15:56", "just hate having to do that you know",

encouraging the", "16:59", "the the problem with Donald Trump and", "17:01", "and this is something that I didn't clue", "17:04", "into until I'd spent a lot of time", "17:05", "watching the guy and following him", "17:07", "around is that he can sound like you", "17:10", "believe something very deeply and you", "17:13", "can be absolutely convinced that he even", "17:16", "logically thinks it thinks a thing but", "17:19", "he'll have a meeting with somebody and", "17:22", "five minutes later he'll have a", "17:24", "completely the opposite opinion so I", "17:26", "have no confidence that Donald Trump", "17:27", "will anything that he says that he'll", "17:31", "did it will stay his opinion on anything", "17:33", "yeah he can be convinced to go to a", "17:35", "complete 180 on basically any issue", "17:37", "which is scary isn't he in some ways the", "17:41", "perfect representative of America", "17:42", "because of that absolutely he has no", "17:44", "attention span and and and I talked", "17:47", "about this when I was covering him", "17:49", "because people said Oh what is this", "17:51", "billionaire in New York or have in", "17:52", "common with with ordinary Americans he", "17:56", "has a lot in common with him he has", "17:57", "exactly the same media habits that they", "17:59", "have he reads the same dumb shit on the", "18:01", "internet he has the same total inability", "18:05", "to separate fact and fiction", "18:08", "he's completely credulous when he reads", "18:11", "a news item about something that he", "18:14", "personally agrees with and he'll he'll", "18:17", "tweet it out five seconds later before", "18:19", "he checks it out which is like what", "18:21", "every other American does you know they", "18:23", "get something on Facebook and they", "18:24", "immediately share it with you know all", "18:25", "their friends and this is this is an", "18:28", "American thing now just the total", "18:30", "inability to to logically look at things", "18:35", "yeah and the short attention span to a", "18:37", "short attention span drifting in and out", "18:39", "of conversations not being able to pay", "18:42", "attention to memos unless his name is in", "18:44", "there people I know it sounds like", "18:48", "American right right and and you know", "18:50", "it's it's funny because if you if you", "18:54", "watch Trump's speeches are actually", "18:56", "better or better yet if you read Trump", "18:57", "speeches it's they would pass out the", "19:01", "text of what Trump was supposed to say", "19:03", "before his events and so I'd be sitting", "19:07", "there I'd be looking at the the remarks", "19:09", "and they would be cogent from one end to", "19:11", "the other then he would get up there and", "19:14", "the first line would be like oh it's so", "19:15", "great to be back in Manchester New", "19:16", "Hampshire I always loved you know being", "19:18", "here and that would be right and then he", "19:21", "would veer off and he would he would", "19:23", "start saying one thing and then the", "19:26", "other thing", "19:27", "and his thoughts would drift in all", "19:29", "these different directions and then when", "19:30", "you looked at the actual transcript of", "19:32", "what Donald Trump had said he not only", "19:36", "wasn't completing thoughts he wasn't", "19:39", "completing sentences he talks in these", "19:41", "sort of strange fragments and he'll", "19:45", "he'll drift from one idea to another and", "19:47", "they won't have any logical connection", "19:49", "to each other and people still

but but that and I just spent a lot", "48:12", "of time writing about the", "48:12", "the the that model where newspapers had", "48:17", "this direct relationship with their", "48:19", "readers right like they not only owned", "48:23", "it the content and created the content", "48:25", "but they also could completely control", "48:29", "the distribution right they they had the", "48:31", "trucks they had the paper kids like us", "48:33", "right that was all part of what gave the", "48:37", "press its power is that we were we had", "48:40", "the unique ability to reach all these", "48:41", "people well you know once the internet", "48:44", "came along they cut that in half right", "48:46", "so now the distribution is all Google", "48:49", "and Facebook and the content is all", "48:53", "being made by somebody else so it's it", "48:57", "makes it very difficult to make money a", "49:00", "and then B you just don't have that that", "49:03", "personal relationship with the with the", "49:06", "the consumer anymore which is which is a", "49:08", "completely different sort of paradigm I", "49:10", "do you think there's a connection now to", "49:13", "ponder this myself it seems like in the", "49:15", "early days of the internet one a big", "49:17", "factor with the music industry for sure", "49:19", "was Napster mm-hm Napster came along and", "49:22", "then people got this initial taste of", "49:25", "getting a bunch of stuff that you", "49:26", "normally paid for for free mm-hm get", "49:28", "just get tons of it and then so the", "49:30", "internet sort of got associated with", "49:32", "being a free thing and then there was", "49:34", "BitTorrent and through BitTorrent you", "49:36", "can get films and all kinds of different", "49:38", "stuff you could download movies and and", "49:40", "people just started filling up hard", "49:42", "drives with this stuff they would get", "49:43", "off a BitTorrent and in my mind at least", "49:46", "it became this connection with the", "49:49", "internet stuffs free there's so much", "49:51", "stuff free like why did I pay for this", "49:53", "right and that's free and I've tried to", "49:55", "say this to friends who get involved", "49:58", "with podcasting who have come over from", "50:01", "radio like just friends that have been", "50:02", "fired from radio jobs like you know what", "50:04", "I'm just gonna start a podcast and", "50:06", "charge people five bucks a month but as", "50:08", "soon as you do that people like why the", "50:09", "fuck would I pay alright Adam Carolla", "50:11", "for free read Joey Diaz for free why", "50:14", "would I pay five dollars for you right", "50:17", "yeah absolutely know that you the", "50:19", "audience expectations now or that", "50:21", "they're gonna get free content", "50:22", "everything's free yeah everything's free", "50:24", "and", "50:25", "obviously that has huge consequences", "50:28", "because that forces people who create", "50:32", "the content to get the money from", "50:33", "somewhere else they either have to be", "50:35", "sponsored by an advertiser who might", "50:37", "have you know certain expectations but", "50:41", "you know it's certainly not good for", "50:42", "people who make content that it's like", "50:45", "that yeah and and it creates I think a", "50:48", "lot of bad habits with with with the", "50:50", "readers too I mean they they just you", "50:53", "know rather than rather than look for", "50:55", "the best stuff they just look for what's", "50:58", "available and what they can read for", "50:59", "free also I think it opens up the door", "51:02", "to all this wacky advertising we're", "51:04", "pop-up ads and and scroll down ads like", "51:07", "you try to scroll down the screen and", "51:08", "the ad follows with you know god it's so", "51:10", "annoying right it's weird yeah just it's", "51:12", "they're so invasive and they're", "51:14", "everywhere even on really good websites", "51:16", "like like say if you go to CNN you get", "51:19", "the real stories and then below you get", "51:21", "this stuff that looks like stories but", "51:23", "there's a very faint print that says", "51:26", "paid content right and then you look at", "51:28", "it like you're not gonna believe what", "51:30", "she looks like now can't even find out", "51:37", "what she looks like now cuz you got to", "51:38", "go through 40 other people that look", "51:41", "like shit now too and then finally you", "51:44", "get sometimes you don't even get to the", "51:45", "original one so you're confused like I", "51:47", "think it's better if they don't satisfy", "51:48", "you cuz then you just go back to the", "51:50", "rest of say well what does he look like", "51:53", "all these different there was like one", "51:57", "of those pages that you go to where", "51:59", "there's just dozens and dozens of", "52:01", "windows and boxes that you can click on", "52:03", "for a different individual like click", "52:06", "Ebates stories where you go to each one", "52:08", "of them and they'll take you to 40 pages", "52:10", "right of different people that have", "52:12", "gained weight or lost weight or a poor", "52:14", "now or right whatever it is but that's I", "52:17", "mean I think it's one of the things", "52:22", "that's really bad about that is that if", "52:24", "you spend enough time doing that your", "52:25", "brain stops being able to do other", "52:27", "things you know like when you're reading", "52:30", "books books require you to sit there and", "52:33", "construct in your head all the visuals", "52:36", "for everything that you're reading you", "52:38", "have to imagine", "52:39", "what the people look like you have to", "52:40", "you know do all this mental work to", "52:44", "construct the scene right so your brain", "52:46", "is actively engaged in this in this", "52:48", "really highly specific and creative way", "52:50", "right but the internet now just has it", "52:55", "moving from place to place clicking from", "52:58", "place to place go going from sensation", "53:00", "to sensation you don't have to ponder",

another", "53:10", "to the next thing which is what you're", "53:11", "talking about with trunk that's the way", "53:13", "his brain works right like and it's it's", "53:16", "a I think it's a bad thing you know it's", "53:19", "not only bad in itself but it makes it", "53:21", "impossible for us to do the other thing", "53:22", "you know which is which is more", "53:24", "constructive ya know it's almost like", "53:26", "mental range of motion like if you are", "53:29", "somehow another your joints were", "53:30", "restricted where you could only like", "53:32", "move a certain amount after a while you", "53:34", "would lose your full range of motion", "53:36", "absolutely it gets atrophy yeah I have a", "53:39", "harder time reading books now than I did", "53:40", "when I was you know probably 11 years", "53:43", "old and and that's just from and you're", "53:46", "a writer right I'm a writer I mean I", "53:48", "love it yeah you know I I still I find", "53:51", "that I have a harder time doing the work", "53:54", "you know yeah and that's difficult or", "53:57", "yeah like when I was when I was younger", "54:00", "I read more fiction which which is", "54:02", "harder because it requires you to do", "54:05", "more you know sort of mental", "54:07", "construction work now it's much if I'm", "54:11", "gonna read a book it's typically", "54:12", "nonfiction which is linear which is an", "54:14", "argument right it's it's it's it's less", "54:18", "it requires less work of the reader", "54:19", "right yeah it may be just as interesting", "54:22", "but it just requires less work so the", "54:24", "hardest thing to read is you know Anna", "54:27", "Karenina or something like that right", "54:29", "yes yeah you you have to not only think", "54:31", "but you have to construct but with your", "54:33", "if you're just reading you know the", "54:34", "diary of Kim Kardashian or something", "54:37", "like that you're just you're just kind", "54:38", "of

winning and", "88:00", "that and that day that they did this as", "88:07", "a publicity stunt in the beginning", "88:08", "probably with the aim of either creating", "88:11", "a media network or just bolstering", "88:14", "Trump's overall Q rating or whatever it", "88:16", "was I think NBC might have pushed him", "88:19", "towards the presidency by firing him", "88:22", "from The Apprentice yeah

long", "89:41", "super boring reality show or at least it", "89:43", "used to be until Trump came along Trump", "89:46", "completely changed the dynamic of it you", "89:49", "know if you're if you're thinking of it", "89:50", "in terms of how it looks to a network", "89:52", "what were the network's thinking before", "89:54", "if they if they were gonna have people", "89:56", "like Scott Walker and Lindsey Graham be", "89:58", "the stars of their lead reality show", "90:01", "like let's get a real performer in there", "90:04", "right and and when they did when they", "90:06", "when then when

time and there's a there's", "90:18", "an amazing data point right now which is", "90:20", "that the public trusts the press less", "90:24", "than ever right they believe the things", "90:26", "that we say less than ever all the polls", "90:28", "show this that there's been a dramatic", "90:29", "downturn and how much people will put", "90:32", "stock in things that people like me say", "90:34",

"and kind of horrifying but but really", "91:04", "interesting isn't that also what he", "91:06", "played upon when he was running like he", "91:08", "would say outrageous shit so they would", "91:09", "cover him and that essentially gave him", "91:11", "free press oh absolutely yeah and he", "91:13", "there was no doubt in my mind that that", "91:15", "he was doing that intentionally I",

thinking that", "134:19", "they're actually gonna be real hedge", "134:22", "funds and that they they have some stock", "134:25", "picking system that's actually gonna", "134:26", "make all their clients money and one of", "134:28", "the things they find out is that a they", "134:30", "suck they they they're not outperforming", "134:33", "the market and they're not that smart", "134:34", "but be that their clients can't tell if", "134:38", "they just make up the numbers so there", "134:40", "there are a number of cases of people", "134:42", "who start out trying to be legitimate", "134:45", "and trying to be really real investment", "134:47", "advisors but they just end up turning it", "134:50", "to Bernie Madoff types because it's just", "134:53", "easy there's no there aren't that many", "134:55", "people watching for it and you know that", "134:58", "that's kind of scary too well it seems", "135:00", "like there's so many people doing it how", "135:05", "could there be enough people watching it", "135:07", "right about how many investment firms", "135:08", "there are and how many different people", "135:10", "that are involved in trading how could", "135:13", "anybody be watching all of it right ya", "135:15", "know there but even even so even if you", "135:21", "take that into consideration than the", "135:22", "number of eyes that are that are on this", "135:25", "world is is ridiculously low electic", "135:28", "take AIG alright AIG was one of the", "135:31", "world's largest companies that you know", "135:34", "before before it crashed it had like a", "135:37", "hundred eighty thousand employees it was", "135:41", "it took advantage of this weird loophole", "135:43", "that allows financial companies to", "135:45", "essentially choose their own regulator", "135:48", "so because because AIG had a thrift or", "135:53", "Savings and Loan that's basically the", "135:55", "same thing they chose to be regulated by", "135:59", "the OTS which is the office of Thrift", "136:02", "Supervision which is this tiny tiny", "136:05", "little you know office in Washington", "136:10", "that oversees basically savings and loan", "136:12", "operations and in in the OTS this is", "136:17", "this is actually true the they had", "136:19", "exactly one insurance expert on staff so", "136:23", "essentially with the world's largest", "136:24", "insurance company was being regulated by", "136:28", "a government office that only had one", "136:31", "person who really understood insurance", "136:32", "and and even and even that person", "136:35", "wouldn't have understood the the part of", "136:38", "the company that blew up which was", "136:41", "essentially an investment bank within", "136:43", "the insurance company that was creating", "136:46", "these sort of highly advanced sort of", "136:47", "derivative operations that know that", "136:51", "they just would not have been able to", "136:53", "understand that stuff so there the", "136:56", "government just does not place", "136:58", "a lot of resources into you know keeping", "137:02", "an eye on even the most basic things and", "137:05", "when you compare that to law enforcement", "137:07", "in other areas you know is how many how", "137:11", "many people do we have", "137:12", "you know worrying about bank bank", "137:14", "robberies in this country or or drugs", "137:17", "right or you know how many people are", "137:20", "being watched because they're marijuana", "137:22", "dealers in other states I mean it dwarfs", "137:25", "the number of people who are watching", "137:26", "for economic crimes yeah one person yeah", "137:31", "I just love the the name of it office of", "137:34", "Thrift Supervision yeah exactly sure it", "137:37", "exists anymore I think it was it was", "137:39", "merged into some other because there", "137:43", "used to be the OCC officer of the", "137:45", "Comptroller of the currency and I think", "137:47", "they created a new regulator ad out of", "137:50", "all that after the crash but but yeah", "137:53", "and I just shows it's regulator and it's", "137:55", "regulator you know was totally", "137:58", "overmatched didn't couldn't understand", "138:00", "shit and that's one of the reasons why", "138:02", "the company blew up the company also", "138:03", "blew up because it was run by insurance", "138:06", "people who didn't understand they idea", "138:11", "was basically Wall Street's bookie all", "138:13", "these people were betting all these", "138:15", "investment banks were betting on whether", "138:16", "or not mortgages were gonna fail or not", "138:18", "and AIG was selling the product that", "138:21", "they could use to make those bets", "138:24", "essentially or they were taking on", "138:26", "insurance on packets of mortgages so if", "138:29", "they exploded you would get a payout", "138:31", "right it's like it's like buying an", "138:35", "insurance policy on your neighbor's", "138:36", "house if it goes up in flames you get", "138:38", "paid on it you get paid AIG was selling", "138:41", "a product that allowed banks essentially", "138:43", "to buy insurance on on houses

got", "138:59", "these huge payouts so people were", "139:00", "betting against mortgages basically and", "139:03", "AIG was taking all this book and but the", "139:07", "the heads of the company were old-school", "139:09", "insurance executives who just didn't", "139:11", "understand", "139:12", "this newfangled complicated form of", "139:18", "insurance and so they would look at the", "139:20", "numbers they were being given and even", "139:22", "they didn't get it didn't they didn't", "139:23", "understand how how exposed they were and", "139:27", "so when all the bets started going the", "139:29", "wrong way suddenly they're being asked", "139:31", "to pay out billions of dollars and", "139:33", "they're like wait where is this coming", "139:36", "from", "139:36", "so so even the companies were kind of", "139:38", "clueless about the shit that was going", "139:41", "on it turns out listen man if it wasn't", "139:45", "for you dummies like me would not", "139:48", "understand
