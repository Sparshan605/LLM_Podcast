because I don't", "81:17", "think we really know and I think as soon", "81:18", "as we box it up and and say it's this", "81:21", "thing and this is the the absolute", "81:23", "reaction that the world has when you put", "81:25", "good out there good comes back good and", "81:28", "I all the time folks yet people die I", "81:31", "think we're I think there's I think", "81:33", "there is an

there is this energy of all", "82:01", "of us out there and running around it's", "82:04", "it's not that far to think then there", "82:06", "couldn't be good energy and there's bad", "82:09", "energy and there's and is that", "82:11", "ultimately good and evil maybe it is all", "82:15", "generated from human beings maybe if you", "82:16", "educated everyone and they could all be", "82:18", "kind and try and come in it that way we", "82:20", "could actually feel that there was more", "82:22", "good but that's just more good coming", "82:24", "from people I don't know well if you", "82:25",

that they can travel through", "110:22", "galaxies they can make this shit look", "110:24", "like anything they want it to yeah when", "110:26", "you doll it up radiation pressure with", "110:29", "no rating thor's would be there was no", "110:33", "air in space", "110:34", "right so it wouldn't be aerodynamics", "110:37", "what would it be momentum no go down a", "110:38", "little bit I think it

doesn't", "111:20", "necessarily need this is where I'm", "111:21", "stupid this is where places where I'm", "111:25", "stupid but it doesn't necessarily need", "111:27", "to be aerodynamic right because it's not", "111:28", "going through air the vacuum of space", "111:30", "right exactly so I'm not wrong there it", "111:33", "could actually look like a rock because", "111:35", "the only issue would be getting it into", "111:37", "space right the aerodynamics is assuming", "111:39", "that you're shooting it from a planet", "111:41", "with an atmosphere and gravity cannot be", "111:43", "talked about this way too stupid if you", "111:48", "shot if you like about your launching it", "111:50", "from earth into space right yeah what if", "111:52", "you had it encased in like this outer", "111:55", "area sort of like the space shuttle is", "111:58", "yeah but then once you get to a place", "112:00", "you could jettison the outside of it", "112:02", "just like they'd get rid of those", "112:04", "booster rockets they just fall into the", "112:06", "bus integrate land on people other fish", "112:13", "getting killed by a booster rocket fly", "112:15", "space and hit you in the face didn't", "112:18", "disintegrate but then they could do that", "112:20", "they could release the shell and then", "112:22", "they would just have the rock and the", "112:23", "rock would move through space and it", "112:25", "didn't matter what shape it was because", "112:26", "it's in the vacuum of space we just get", "112:28", "it up into orbit orbit like the space", "112:31", "station go and build it in pieces and", "112:33", "then launch it do you remember when that", "112:35", "commander Chris Hadfield gentleman was", "112:37", "on the podcast and he was talking about", "112:40", "some kind of magnet that they have that", "112:43", "collects subatomic particles out there", "112:46", "in the galaxy and that we only know", "112:48", "five percent of what the universe is", "112:50", "made out of my gonna talk about things", "112:52", "like dark matter and he was five", "112:54", "percents the guys scientist space a real", "112:58", "legit astronaut coming back from six", "113:00", "months in space or whatever the fuck he", "113:02", "was there for and telling us this Wow", "113:06", "we've talked about that like you can", "113:08", "hang with those guys for a little while", "113:10", "and then you're like I don't understand", "113:12", "what's happening now well it's also the", "113:14", "I mean it's amazing what we do know", "113:16", "amazing if they can send a guy to space", "113:19", "and have them fly around the ISS or yeah", "113:21", "I mean we'll talk about what you were", "113:23", "saying about why are we here and what", "113:25", "are we doing yeah like we haven't", "113:26", "developed yet something that can go the", "113:30", "speed of light we haven't like mmmm but", "113:33", "if we do then the whole universe is open", "113:35", "to us maybe that's what it is maybe the", "113:37", "struggle of developing all the stuff is", "113:38", "to get to a scientific level where we", "113:41", "can really go I don't think they think", "113:43", "the speed of light is even good enough", "113:44", "really yeah I think damn it it was my", "113:47", "goal I think that like if you wanted to", "113:52", "have options available as to what planet", "113:55", "you're gonna colonize you're gonna have", "113:57", "to who knows like what if you Lana what", "114:00", "do you land on a planet and it's like", "114:02", "hey it's 74 degrees out guys guys it's", "114:04", "all oxygen and nitrogen it's just like", "114:06", "Earth come on out here come on out of", "114:08", "here", "114:08", "but it's only been like that for ten", "114:10", "years and then cycle it's really fucked", "114:13", "up but you're thirty years from now it's", "114:15", "going to be a nice age again are all the", "114:17", "people have moved there and they're", "114:19", "gonna freeze to death is gonna be no", "114:20", "food at all and that planet doesn't give", "114:21", "a fuck that is all our science led us to", "114:25", "that I don't even know if we can predict", "114:27", "like here's my question", "114:29", "can they accurately predict the", "114:32", "atmosphere and the conditions and like", "114:35", "what the temperature would be if a", "114:36", "planet is from a sun-like do they have a", "114:38", "calculation where they say oh this Sun", "114:40", "is this amount of big and this planet is", "114:42", "this far away so it's definitely gonna", "114:44", "stay within a certain temperature range", "114:46", "for the entire time that the planet do", "114:47", "they know that like within like a death", "114:49", "range I don't know", "114:51", "trees they must death range is 40", "114:54", "degrees bro yeah you get to 140 that's a", "114:56", "wrap yeah you're done yeah so like", "114:58", "hundreds of naked", "114:59", "140 everyone's dead right you live in a", "115:03", "sauna you're gonna run out of water I", "115:05", "just don't think we're gonna make it", "115:06", "we're not okay Mikey and we're", "115:08", "definitely not figuring it out because", "115:09", "we're saying this amount of big we're", "115:13", "confusing the produce but seriously", "115:15", "think about that just as a concept like", "115:17", "maybe that is it maybe it's maybe all", "115:20", "this like you keep thinking and you know", "115:22", "you talked a lot about all the robots", "115:24", "and the things that are moving us", "115:25", "forward but why but why but why and I", "115:28", "had the cocoon theory before but maybe", "115:30", "that's not it maybe it's so we can", "115:31", "really go yeah I've had the cocoon", "115:34", "theory for quite a while where I think", "115:35", "that we are like some sort of an", "115:39", "electronic caterpillar that's building", "115:42", "some cocoon and then a butterfly is", "115:45", "gonna emerge because when right when I", "115:47", "is a collective like we'll all be part", "115:49", "of this I don't know I mean just the", "115:51", "innovation and the computers and the AI", "115:53", "and our integration with them that", "115:55", "eventually it's just gonna get smarter", "115:57", "and crazier and weirder yeah I mean it's", "116:00", "only a matter of time before they make", "116:02", "something that resembles a person it", "116:05", "sounds too insular no it sounds too", "116:10", "insular that it would just be for us to", "116:12", "stay here on earth well the universe is", "116:14", "so vast right that there may be I think", "116:17", "it's more likely that we're going to go", "116:21", "out of this that's a very good idea", "116:24", "this is the steward sense it's kind of a", "116:26", "sewer oh but is it though it's amazing", "116:28", "well it's beautiful there's parts come", "116:29", "on man we have a lovely life", "116:31", "you ever been to Utah skipper you could", "116:33", "look at the Stars or look at the", "116:35", "beautiful sky on a day like today oh my", "116:38", "lovely do you go outside this clouds", "116:41", "float around just gives you just right", "116:42", "around a Sun a little bit of contrast is", "116:45", "the best lovely like why would how could", "116:47", "you say this is a sewer because it's so", "116:49", "many parts that are disgusting there's", "116:53", "so many parts being because there's no", "116:55", "because not not so many parts because we", "116:57", "still have this evil this other stuff", "117:01", "that's long at each other and knocking", "117:03", "each other and it's still filled with", "117:04", "right but he's very murder not right", "117:06", "here right right not right here it's", "117:08", "only it's in certain spots so this is", "117:10", "the other thing that we tend to do", "117:11", "because we have", "117:12", "seven billion people on the planet and", "117:15", "cameras on all of them yeah and", "117:17", "everybody's got a Cameron we're", "117:18", "exchanging these stories like yeah", "117:20", "you're catching stories from an", "117:23", "unimaginable number of humans yeah right", "117:26", "and so even if we're looking at just our", "117:28", "country there's so many people just la", "117:30", "so many people it's 20 million people", "117:31", "it's insane what's really amazing it's", "117:34", "really amazing", "117:36", "is not just how far human beings have", "117:38", "come over the last you know hundred two", "117:41", "hundred three hundred years but what's", "117:43", "really amazing is if you just look at", "117:45", "the actual numbers of times that people", "117:47", "interact with each other and how few of", "117:49", "them are violent yeah especially in a", "117:51", "place like America in 2018 I think about", "117:55", "that on the freeway also many people use", "117:57", "it just right and they're all pretty", "117:59", "much acting in an orderly fashion to", "118:02", "preserve themselves and others yeah yeah", "118:04", "no you have every now and then you have", "118:07", "someone that's just crazy just violates", "118:09", "all the rules just weaving in a traffic", "118:11", "right driving 150 miles an hour and a", "118:13", "residential community maybe it's just a", "118:15", "mutation maybe that's just a mutation", "118:17", "you know I think it is I think it is in", "118:20", "the same way those things exists in like", "118:23", "a biological system right you can get", "118:25", "these little diseases little bugs little", "118:28", "things that are off mm-hmm you know and", "118:29", "then you have an immune selling that", "118:30", "battles the bugs yeah like when you see", "118:33", "stuff about chimpanzees err and there's", "118:36", "like everyone's getting along trying to", "118:38", "do their thing their struggles but then", "118:39", "there's a real mutation like there's", "118:41", "someone that there's one that kills the", "118:43", "rest of them and won't be part of the", "118:44", "thing you know that's what we have we", "118:47", "have these kind of like renegade", "118:50", "mutations run by evil yeah right we", "118:52", "should all go back to what's what's", "118:54", "interesting is that it's in large groups", "118:55", "right and all of us together like the", "118:58", "way we interact with each other is", "119:00", "generally nonviolent however these large", "119:03", "groups will decide by whatever you know", "119:08", "whoever's in charge to attack other", "119:10", "large groups and this is where the big", "119:15", "death comes from right this is where the", "119:17", "the real toll comes from in war right so", "119:20", "but if you looked at the actual", "119:21", "communities of people from one side or", "119:24", "the other like the", "119:26", "themselves together how much are they", "119:29", "really in conflict with those other", "119:30", "people probably not nearly as much as", "119:33", "the people that are in charge would want", "119:34", "them to be which right yeah which is a", "119:36", "very split that it's almost like the", "119:38", "mutation is in charge right", "119:40", "because right you take two groups that", "119:42", "are at war you put them together they're", "119:43", "just hanging out drinking beer together", "119:44", "we're all the same aides that probably", "119:46", "have a great time together", "119:48", "their leaders talk them and those", "119:49", "leaders are the mutation that's when", "119:51", "things get scary whether it's the Hitler", "119:53", "leader or you know what would a North", "119:55", "Korea do leading places they're talking", "119:59", "people into invading places yeah that's", "120:03", "some slippery justification yeah you", "120:05", "know that's where the world gets very", "120:07", "strange and and I think it's interesting", "120:09", "that those people in those groups you", "120:12", "know all come from all over the world or", "120:14", "all over the country at least all these", "120:16", "different places they're brought", "120:17", "together right but look how we've", "120:19", "progressed there's fewer of those kind", "120:21", "of conflicts now than ever before", "120:23", "right but you and I and I think a lot of", "120:25", "other people would like it to be zero", "120:26", "amount right yeah but Donald I don't", "120:28", "know if that's ever gonna happen man but", "120:30", "that's a weird thing to say because you", "120:32", "would you would like everybody to be in", "120:34", "a good place this world but you almost", "120:37", "wonder if like many things there's like", "120:39", "this push of good things happening and", "120:42", "bad things positive and negative and", "120:43", "that there's battle between the two of", "120:45", "them is what creates all this momentum", "120:47", "and all this movement that's the good", "120:49", "and evil we're back to the good and evil", "120:51", "so maybe we should go back to church", "120:52", "look the priests did some weird stuff", "120:55", "but maybe we it's good people in there", "120:58", "more than evil people well the problem", "121:01", "is with that church in particular", "121:03", "there's still shielding the people that", "121:06", "have done terrible things yeah yeah", "121:07", "there's just no denying that there's if", "121:10", "you look at the facts if you look at", "121:12", "everything that's come out there's
