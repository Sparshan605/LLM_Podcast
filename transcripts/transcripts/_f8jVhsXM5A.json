talking", "51:56", "to Phil but again what is that is that", "51:58", "an ego trips at your imagination are you", "52:02", "all in I am I'm in I mean because the", "52:05", "problems I've experienced a lot of", "52:07", "bullshit with you need to be skeptical", "52:10", "from the external people that try to", "52:12", "tell you stuff but I've definitely had", "52:14", "people help me understand what all that", "52:18", "shit means when I've had dreams like", "52:19", "that yeah with my deceased relatives and", "52:22", "they told me things and then they", "52:23", "happened and yeah it could be your ego", "52:26", "but I like I don't think that makes it", "52:28", "less real though if it's your ego or", "52:31", "your mind you know creating a scenario", "52:33", "with your loved one or whatever that's", "52:35", "this I don't think that's less real than", "52:36", "the idea of this", "52:37", "spirit reom buddy you know I don't know", "52:42", "some sort of physical thing whatever I", "52:44", "think it's both they're both kind of", "52:46", "valid and it's it's it's energy I think", "52:49", "it's an exchange of energy and I we've", "52:51", "definitely been in places where we felt", "52:54", "like not alone you know we and we", "52:57", "weren't high we were you know you you", "52:59", "have those moments where like your", "53:00", "instincts and your intuition are like", "53:02", "aware of external things that you can't", "53:06", "see but you can feel and maybe maybe you", "53:08", "can see him we've seen a ghost which I", "53:11", "just address what you just said though", "53:13", "but there is a difference right there is", "53:15", "a difference because one of them is your", "53:17", "imagination and one of them is you", "53:18", "talking to a ghost there's a huge", "53:19", "difference because one of them it means", "53:21", "ghosts are real", "53:22", "and the other one it just means your", "53:23", "imagination is real which are absolutely", "53:25", "a hundred percent aware of right so we", "53:27", "know people have ridiculous imaginations", "53:29", "they dream and imagine things constantly", "53:31", "right so there is a big difference", "53:32", "sharing two of them because one of them", "53:34", "one of them gives you a view into a", "53:39", "mystical world that doesn't doesn't in", "53:42", "the eyes of science it doesn't seem to", "53:45", "make sense right it doesn't seem to want", "53:47", "to exist if there's another world where", "53:49", "people come back from the dead and talk", "53:51", "to you and then conversations with you", "53:53", "but one of the arguments that I've", "53:54", "always used with psychedelic drugs is", "53:56", "that if you feel like in a psychedelic", "54:00", "experience you went to heaven and had a", "54:03", "conversation with God or you went to", "54:05", "another dimension and talked to the", "54:06", "infinite wisdom that controls the the", "54:09", "the cells of the universe if you did do", "54:13", "that or if you took the drugs and felt", "54:15", "like you did that it's the same", "54:16", "experience like that's the difference", "54:18", "it's like I don't know if God's real and", "54:20", "I don't know what the fuck happens when", "54:22", "you take psychedelic drugs but god damn", "54:23", "it feels similar like it there's there's", "54:26", "moments where you you have intense", "54:28", "psychedelic trips where you really do", "54:30", "believe you're in the presence of like", "54:32", "this pure wisdom and pure love it sees", "54:34", "you in a way that is undeniable he can", "54:37", "argue it wait I don't know I think", "54:38", "sometimes it's your ego sometimes it's", "54:40", "some weird shit in your brain and", "54:41", "sometimes I think it's real I think it's", "54:43", "it's very complicated it is complicated", "54:45", "my point is they're the same experience", "54:47", "if you're talking to God or if you're", "54:49", "talking to your imagination", "54:51", "and it creates this god it's for that", "54:53", "brief moment in those 15 minutes it's", "54:57", "the same experience and I don't know if", "54:58", "that's enough but that's something like", "55:01", "I don't know like what your your old", "55:03", "time on earth is just time right your", "55:05", "time on earth is just you have a limited", "55:06", "finite amount you got a hundred years if", "55:08", "you're fucking super lucky and you got", "55:10", "good genes", "55:11", "and that's a wrap right so this is we", "55:13", "have this little time thing but during", "55:15", "those 15 minutes which is a small amount", "55:17", "of time but the whole life small during", "55:20", "those 15 minutes", "55:21", "you are absolutely experiencing", "55:25", "something divine now is that your", "55:27", "imagination is that you finding some", "55:30", "portal to another dimension is that the", "55:33", "reason why your brain produces these", "55:34", "chemicals in the first place is because", "55:36", "we transition during the time of death", "55:38", "into this new realm is that it but if", "55:41", "your concept of what divinity is", "55:43", "includes all of that stuff it gets to be", "55:45", "both right", "55:47", "we sure but I mean like that there's a", "55:49", "real problem with defining something", "55:51", "that you just can't define like the", "55:53", "whole problem with psychedelic trips I", "55:55", "don't know like free I don't know if you", "55:56", "guys feel this way but for me it's", "55:58", "always like whenever I tell somebody", "55:59", "about I'm like like why even use words", "56:02", "like the words don't work right they're", "56:05", "not enough not enough you can scramble", "56:07", "them together and say imperfect", "56:09", "screaming - it can almost like demean", "56:13", "the experience language yeah you know", "56:21", "and that's why I think there's such a", "56:23", "wide array of people's theories and", "56:25", "beliefs and thoughts and they're all", "56:27", "valid because we don't have there's no", "56:29", "agreed-upon language to say okay this is", "56:31", "how we all feel this is how we're doing", "56:33", "it right you know it's similar it's just", "56:35", "I always go back to music with this", "56:37", "stuff but this is a similar pathway and", "56:40", "trend in music where people are", "56:42", "constantly redefining the language of it", "56:44", "and you know there's a kind of a", "56:45", "mainstream openness to that or there", "56:48", "isn't but the idea that the point is the", "56:51", "language is dynamic you know and it goes", "56:53", "on to continuously try and express", "56:55", "something that's kind of inexpressible", "56:57", "yeah and that's why it acts as a magnet", "57:00", "for people's thought because they say", "57:01", "okay this this is kind of our pathway of", "57:04", "experiment", "57:05", "to understand these phenomenons in", "57:08", "streams like the fast food of music a", "57:11", "little bit and then there's some more", "57:12", "obscure like restaurants off the beaten", "57:14", "path that you've never tasted anything", "57:16", "like
