so many", "90:23", "people go through like vitamin d", "90:24", "deficient", "90:25", "i mean that is like one of the most", "90:27", "common ones and that's one of the big", "90:28", "ones with kovid", "90:29", "yeah more than 80 percent of the people", "90:31", "in multiple studies", "90:32", "80 of the people that were in the icu", "90:34", "with kovid", "90:35", "had vitamin d deficient levels which", "90:38", "most of us i think most of us have yes", "90:40", "right", "90:40", "only four percent had sufficient levels", "90:42", "wow which is crazy right", "90:44", "so i mean that doesn't you know", "90:46", "correlation and causation it doesn't", "90:47", "exactly mean that vitamin d is going to", "90:49", "protect you but it is", "90:50", "it's crucial for health and it's it's a", "90:53", "a vitamin that's actually", "90:54", "also according to uh dr rhonda patrick", "90:57", "taught me this that", "90:58", "it's also a hormone you know and it's uh", "91:02", "you know it's something that", "91:05", "it's crucial and most people don't get", "91:06", "it and if you if you stay inside all day", "91:08", "you definitely don't get it", "91:09", "and african americans have an even", "91:10", "harder time getting it because", "91:12", "their ancestors yeah their ancestors", "91:15", "developed all this melanin in their skin", "91:16", "because they were constantly exposed to", "91:17", "sunlight and the melanin was there to", "91:19", "protect you from the sunlight", "91:20", "so and they didn't have to worry about", "91:22", "absorbing the vitamin d

needed it", "91:38", "yeah you you had it", "91:39", "like look at the people that live in the", "91:40", "places where it rains all the time", "91:42", "they're white as fuck", "91:43", "that's why i mean it's real simple it's", "91:45", "a survival meth", "91:46", "mechanism for vitamin d for the one", "91:49", "thing like", "91:50", "my doctor told me that when he was", "91:52", "measuring people he would measure black", "91:53", "folks in new york", "91:54", "and some of them had undetectable levels", "91:57", "of vitamin d", "91:58", "which is insane wow because you're in", "92:00", "the winter right you're covering your", "92:02", "body completely you're not going outside", "92:04", "and you're also not supplementing no so", "92:07", "so let's go into diet so for me", "92:10", "for me um i i got into these crazy races", "92:13", "and my diet that i", "92:15", "believe hopefully it wasn't just a", "92:17", "mental thing um", "92:19", "was more fruits and veggies and so if i", "92:21", "made a food pyramid", "92:23", "the very top of the pyramid would be you", "92:25", "know fish eggs and meat but just", "92:27", "15 of my diet the rest was like", "92:31", "avocado salad like i performed fantastic", "92:34", "on that diet", "92:35", "that sounds great for you i mean but for", "92:37", "me for me and you've tried different", "92:38", "ways you've tried like more meat", "92:40", "more fish less meat less vegetables", "92:42", "you've you've varied", "92:44", "and this is primarily fruits and", "92:46", "vegetables for you yeah", "92:48", "primarily fruits i would say more", "92:49", "veggies well if you think about what", "92:50", "you're doing", "92:51", "i mean it makes sense right you're doing", "92:53", "a lot of endurance stuff", "92:54", "yeah and a lot of endurance stuff", "92:56", "requires a lot of carbohydrates you know", "92:58", "also you're getting a lot of vitamins", "92:59", "from all those vegetables a lot of", "93:00", "minerals from all those vegetables", "93:02", "yep makes sense and a little bit of meat", "93:04", "and when i i did a", "93:05", "an event in fiji once the fijians are", "93:09", "phenomenal rugby players and we were out", "93:11", "like literally in the jungle", "93:13", "of fiji and uh animals these guys are", "93:16", "like ripped and they got the machetes", "93:19", "and barefoot and they're going from like", "93:21", "for them to go to see a friend in", "93:23", "another village it's like a 15 mile hike", "93:25", "and they would kill a cow they'd eat", "93:27", "mostly vegetable vegetables but

in", "93:39", "the cow's neck and like", "93:41", "mix a little milk uh with the blood", "93:43", "drink it up until a point where they", "93:45", "killed it", "93:45", "but i would say they were not they were", "93:47", "more veggies than you know they'd eat", "93:49", "that cow", "93:50", "once every six months but up till then", "93:51", "it's like all veggies and they were", "93:53", "these guys like was that because of", "93:55", "necessity though yes yeah", "93:57", "that's because that was what was", "93:58", "available that's available yeah they", "93:59", "didn't have", "94:00", "a whole foods or car or tv or anything", "94:03", "yeah i mean it's real clear that people", "94:06", "evolved in to adapt to their", "94:09", "environments", "94:10", "like whatever their environments were", "94:12", "and if you were living in a plant-rich", "94:13", "environment", "94:15", "look there's a lot of people that live", "94:16", "in the jungles of south america that", "94:18", "prefer

"people cooking up baboons he said that", "94:58", "they people like miners and people that", "95:01", "are", "95:02", "out there that that have killed", "95:04", "essentially so many animals", "95:06", "in that area they've depopulated that", "95:08", "area so badly that baboons are like the", "95:10", "last thing left", "95:12", "so that's what this this tribe hunts", "95:14", "fuck",

way it's like cannibalism like", "95:41", "i've read a lot about uh native american", "95:43", "history", "95:44", "and one of the more disturbing things is", "95:46", "how prevalent cannibalism was", "95:48", "and how prevalent cannibalism was where", "95:50", "they would kill their enemies and eat", "95:52", "them", "95:52", "and roast them over the fire and and you", "95:54", "know and sometimes eat them while", "95:56", "they're still alive", "95:57", "was that you think that was part of like", "95:58", "the reward i don't know man some of it", "96:01", "was just survival", "96:02", "right i mean when you're you're you're", "96:04", "talking about people that evolved", "96:06", "first primarily without horses right", "96:10", "it's like without horses for who knows", "96:12", "how many thousands of years until the", "96:13", "europeans came", "96:14", "when the europeans came they taught them", "96:16", "horseback riding and then they started", "96:18", "stealing horses and then they started", "96:20", "raising horses and then they started", "96:21", "getting", "96:21", "better at riding horses and doing battle", "96:23", "on horses than any of the", "96:25", "europeans were like the comanches were", "96:27", "far better on", "96:28", "horseback than any it's one of the main", "96:30", "reasons why", "96:31", "the west was so difficult to settle", "96:33", "because", "96:34", "the europeans the settlers only had", "96:36", "muskets single shot taking like", "96:39", "you know 30 seconds to fucking reload", "96:41", "whereas the comanches can unload", "96:43", "30 arrows in that time right you know in", "96:45", "probably well", "96:46", "30 seconds probably more they'll", "96:47", "probably unload 40 or 50 arrows in 33", "96:50", "times", "96:51", "yeah and you're dead you're fucked and", "96:53", "they could fight on horseback", "96:54", "the europeans hadn't figured out how to", "96:56", "fight on horseback they would climb off", "96:57", "the horse", "96:58", "to aim their rifle and then shoot it and", "97:00", "then they'd have to reload and the", "97:01", "command should just run up on them", "97:02", "and shoot from horseback so", "97:06", "the idea that these people who grew up", "97:09", "in this place or evolved in this place", "97:11", "where they didn't have horses", "97:14", "they ate whatever the fuck they could", "97:15", "they came here on foot", "97:17", "from asia right and a lot of them came", "97:20", "through the bering strait", "97:21", "like they ate whatever they could yeah", "97:23", "right it was survival and if you", "97:25", "you had a war with a neighboring tribe", "97:28", "and you killed them", "97:29", "that's a lot of good yeah i got a lot of", "97:30", "meat yeah what are you going to do", "97:31", "you're going to just let it rot", "97:32", "yeah or you could just eat them and come", "97:34", "up with some reason why you're stealing", "97:35", "their soul or", "97:36", "whatever it is you cook them over fire i", "97:39", "i got a saying that's um", "97:41", "fire ready aim rather than you know aim", "97:44", "ready fire", "97:44", "and you sounds like you've got a lot of", "97:46", "knowledge in this area but my thinking", "97:47", "is", "97:48", "aim ready fire came from like took 30", "97:51", "seconds", "97:52", "to load like you don't want to miss that", "97:53", "shot right right but today", "97:56", "we've got the ability to like shoot a", "97:57", "lot if you use it as an example in", "97:59", "business or whatever like", "98:00", "fuck it take shots right whereas whereas", "98:03", "the mindset i think is um", "98:06", "slow down aim get but you never take the", "98:09", "shot", "98:10", "could you talk yourself out of it i'm", "98:11", "not going to start this business i'm not", "98:12", "going to do this new job i'm not going", "98:13", "to do this i'm not going to do that", "98:15", "um i just take lots of fucking shots", "98:18", "well that seems like it's going to suit", "98:20", "your personality though right", "98:22", "yeah i think some people are more", "98:23", "calculated more german perhaps", "98:25", "more german slowly engineer this", "98:28",
