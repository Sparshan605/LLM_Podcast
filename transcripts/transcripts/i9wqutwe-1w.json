shooting out of the like it", "13:31", "because the the engine was about ten", "13:34", "rows ahead of me but the sparks were", "13:37", "visible behind you know because your do", "13:40", "you understand like the physics yeah", "13:41", "like it's a long trail of sparks thing", "13:45", "and so we get to the point where we're", "13:48", "gonna make our like landing and to see", "13:52",

shaking or", "14:41", "cold shaking it's like full and your", "14:45", "body is just like completely vibrating", "14:47", "like at another frequency and I realized", "14:50", "for the first time in my life that I", "14:52", "didn't care if I was dead like in two", "14:56", "seconds and I felt nothing it really", "14:58", "upset me that my body my soft squishy", "15:00", "body it was gonna be like pinned into", "15:02", "metal it bugged me like I really thought", "15:06", "like we're never doing this again like", "15:08", "this it just became very very real that", "15:10", "my that I cared about this arm and I", "15:13", "cared about this leg and I didn't want", "15:14", "like it to be completely mangled and", "15:17", "like stuck in metal and we hit the we", "15:20", "got the ground it was a very rough", "15:21", "landing and there were fire trucks going", "15:25", "like a hundred and ten miles an hour on", "15:27", "either side of us spraying us with the D", "15:31", "accelerant or whatever that yeah", "15:32", "and suddenly like foam on the windows", "15:36", "and are you ready for this so it was not", "15:39", "a fun thing but we survived and no one", "15:41", "was harmed and then we had to get back", "15:43", "on another plane because I had to go", "15:46", "home to see my kids so he literally sat", "15:48", "there and waited and got right back on", "15:49", "another plane Wow and flew huh well you", "15:53", "probably like what are the odds no I", "15:55", "just I wanted to see my kid right but", "15:58", "like that was an intense you mean that", "16:00", "thing

as I ever was but like in that", "16:20", "moment it was very real to me no fuck I", "16:25", "haven't had anything like that that's", "16:27", "intense", "16:28", "I know what's more intense getting the", "16:30", "hit by lightning or the fire they're", "16:32", "both pretty fucked what about the Cessna", "16:34", "at lost power over the Bermuda Triangle", "16:37", "second you know what that is they think", "16:39", "they think it's nitrogen escaping from", "16:42", "the seafloor they think there's trapped", "16:44", "nitrogen and massive amounts you know", "16:46", "cuz there's a lot of like dead things", "16:48", "and decaying things like vegetation and", "16:52", "things like that and they trapped", "16:53", "nitrogen pockets and those nitrogen", "16:55", "pockets when they lift up they can go", "16:57", "through the surface of the water and up", "16:59", "into the air and if a plane is flying", "17:01", "into that is methane is it methane I say", "17:05", "it wrong", "17:05", "yeah because nitrogen is here yeah cig", "17:08", "84% of the air but I think there's", "17:10", "something about it being a giant pocket", "17:12", "that you fly through I might be wrong it", "17:14", "you're talking about the game and the", "17:17", "tectonic yeah and it can like make a", "17:20", "ship go down because there's no right", "17:22", "there's no buoyancy for the ships and", "17:24", "also for planes it makes explosions", "17:28", "explain oh my god is how we roll I'm", "17:32", "never leaving come stay you can come", "17:35", "anytime you want this is incredible", "17:37", "we can come and just talk about UFOs", "17:38", "every week oh my god this is incredible", "17:40", "explosions of trapped methane gas are", "17:43", "thought to account for the mysterious", "17:44", "creators in Siberia and", "17:46", "this one yeah and so they think that it", "17:47", "has to do something with them you know", "17:49", "triangle as well so when biological", "17:52", "tissue creates methane and when they", "17:55", "have like massive amounts of die-off", "17:57", "whether it's fish or whether it's plants", "18:00", "or things like that they think that some", "18:01", "of that stuff gets trapped in the bottom", "18:03", "of the sea floor and then escapes goes", "18:06", "up to the surface makes boat sink and", "18:09", "even can bring down planes how would

in that area it's a frequent", "21:49", "occurrence and because of that a lot of", "21:50", "these people see things and then they", "21:52", "start talking then people start looking", "21:53", "for

it occurs at low", "22:21", "altitude as well you know they say ball", "22:24", "they don't know why", "22:25", "apparently I talked to a scientist about", "22:27", "this he was telling me that lightning", "22:28", "shouldn't be possible like these there", "22:32", "shouldn't be enough power to create", "22:33", "lightning there's like if you do the", "22:35", "calculations he's like but clearly we", "22:37", "know it's true so what do we do about", "22:39", "that we don't really know we don't know", "22:40", "enough about lightning so when you", "22:42", "describe ball lightning he's like wolf", "22:44", "good fucking luck who knows yeah we", "22:48", "don't know what the conditions are like", "22:49", "what causes what doesn't mean there's", "22:50", "not enough energy for

he was", "22:59", "describing it to me the way he was", "23:01", "explaining it and I think I read it as", "23:03", "well he was explaining and what I read", "23:06", "was that they don't really understand", "23:09", "how that much energy is produced in the", "23:11", "sky like that and that if you calculated", "23:15", "like what it would take to produce", "23:17", "artificial that shouldn't be possible", "23:20", "again I'm a moron so talk now I wish the", "23:24", "expert were here but was like that", "23:27", "fascinate yeah so he would this guy was", "23:29", "described was talking about ball", "23:30", "lightning we were saying they don't know", "23:31", "how to recreate ball lightning they they", "23:33", "have no idea what causes it but they're", "23:35", "sure it's a real thing wait we can't", "23:37", "recreate ball lightning in a lab and", "23:40", "believe so I don't believe so that's", "23:42", "crazy yeah I don't think you know you're", "23:45", "right because we can't generate that", "23:46", "amount of power yeah we literally can't", "23:49", "generate I mean maybe with a bomb but we", "23:51", "can't generate that I don't know I have", "23:54", "no idea I

lucky", "71:22", "because we've experienced both we've", "71:24", "experienced I mean when I was a kid we", "71:26", "didn't have fucking answering machines", "71:27", "no I know right", "71:29", "you just called and hope they were home", "71:31", "yeah and if they were at home you never", "71:33", "found them even you open that door to", "71:35", "your house you were a ghost you just", "71:36", "guide be there to trust you you you were", "71:39", "where you said to work you just went", "71:40", "places you do whatever you want you know", "71:43", "and that's the last wild ones that's",

you", "72:12", "said how long is the electricity down if", "72:15", "we're attacked on the infrastructure", "72:16", "that's what I want to know", "72:18", "well we were talking about the internet",

accomplish", "72:36", "that's what I want to know about like", "72:38", "how long is the recovery time because I", "72:40", "do feel like Putin's sitting back there", "72:42", "like well I think what they're really", "72:43", "worried about other than Putin is solar", "72:47", "flares they think solar flares have the", "72:49", "real potential to take out the entire", "72:51", "power grid that

everybody should", "73:16", "be fair I was worried about that", "73:17", "although I know it's bulging mm-hmm yeah", "73:19", "I think the Northwest part is bulging", "73:21", "well it's just constantly having", "73:23", "earthquakes they've had thousands of", "73:24", "earthquakes every year for the last five", "73:26", "or six years thousands there are", "73:28", "thousands and a muscle

wanna know they want to", "73:38", "dig a hole no they want to drill a hole", "73:40", "and let some of the gas out well Wow", "73:44", "I applaud their you know yeah they want", "73:53", "to Lance's it and push some of the lava", "73:54", "out what's crazy is is that that's", "73:58", "happened to human civilization like many", "74:01", "times over the course of history giant", "74:03",

let's just say we're on", "75:29", "Mars what do we do", "75:31", "we're just Tara crying crying stop", "75:34", "working Rock yeah I mean I just don't", "75:38", "see the life there well I think people", "75:40", "want to be pioneers and I think it's", "75:43", "entirely possible that you're gonna wind", "75:45", "up going with some really crazy people", "75:46", "Yeah right who wants to be a pioneer", "75:49", "that isolated yeah crazy pants right", "75:52", "yeah see if I know a lady who lives in", "75:55", "the Arctic Circle she lives like 200", "75:56", "miles above the Arctic Circle she's on", "75:58", "that show life below zero you ever see", "76:00", "that show but she can come out when she", "76:02", "wants she'll come back she flies back", "76:03", "she was in the studio not this one the", "76:05", "old one but she was sitting right where", "76:07", "you're sitting like you know she's a", "76:09", "normal person I can't even take a cruise", "76:11", "no no but you're gonna cruise in the", "76:14", "Congo that's a river but I can't take a", "76:19", "cruise though because I can't be", "76:21", "isolated in the middle of the ocean with", "76:22", "people I don't think are really on the", "76:24", "ball like I can't do it I think that's", "76:26", "where like the next plague starts I", "76:28", "think does happen sometimes yeah they", "76:31", "get the norovirus or whatever on a", "76:33", "cruise ship and what if someone's just", "76:35", "really into chucking people over the", "76:36", "side like that's your move you just take", "76:39", "a cruise I like those people that", "76:40", "survive that I like the stories of the", "76:43", "people that can cruise ship really and", "76:46", "they get found who fucks finds them", "76:48", "they're in a shipping lane they get", "76:50", "found really I love those stories I've", "76:52", "never heard those doors I always thought", "76:54", "your fuck you imagine there's like", "76:56", "almost nothing that can fuck you worse", "76:58", "than to fall off a cruise ship but these", "77:00", "people they they survive it you have to", "77:02", "think of how long can you swim right I", "77:04", "mean it's like 13 hours or I don't know", "77:07", "monkey tread water well you can tread", "77:09", "water longer than that sure you can I", "77:12", "sing like a rock you'll be hallucinating", "77:14",

"77:24", "of seeing boats come by", "77:26", "and talk to him and he like talk to", "77:29", "people that were saying just hang on", "77:31", "hang on longer who's all imaginary like", "77:33", "none of it was real but he was having", "77:35", "like a full sort of trippy virtual", "77:37", "reality experience with his", "77:39", "hallucinations that kept him alive", "77:40", "longer they were like his subconscious", "77:42", "but they would come in his mind in", "77:45", "vessels and like stop and talk to him", "77:48", "throw him something motivate him that's", "77:51", "crazy I guess you could get that if you", "77:53", "go know one of those sensory deprivation", "77:55", "tanks or something like oh you do have", "77:58", "one right over here shut up fuck yeah", "78:00", "Wow yeah well do you do that regularly", "78:04", "yeah do you have a loose Nations yeah", "78:06", "that's right tell me the most extreme", "78:10", "one I was in the jungle and there was", "78:15", "some people that were native to this", "78:18", "place they were dressed in western", "78:20", "clothes they like t-shirts and shorts", "78:22", "but they were barefoot which is often", "78:24", "the case though unfortunately a lot of", "78:27", "people that live in these indigenous", "78:28", "villages they wear like Under Armour", "78:31", "shirts and shit that they someone gets", "78:33", "them somehow it gets down to them", "78:35", "missionaries maybe sometimes bringing", "78:36", "them but they were speaking in a", "78:38", "language that I understood but it was in", "78:41", "English and I don't speak anything other", "78:43", "than English and when they were talking", "78:44", "I was listening to them I was amongst", "78:46", "them and I was listening to them and", "78:48", "they were speaking in this very", "78:49", "different language and then I realized", "78:52", "like holy shit I can understand their", "78:55", "language but I realized that in English", "78:57", "and then poof I popped out of the spell", "78:59", "like my freaking out about it brought me", "79:02", "right it was all I don't know don't go", "79:03", "away don't go away ah fuck it's like it", "79:07", "was so extreme it was I could smell the", "79:10", "the rain I could feel the moisture in", "79:13", "the air I could see the leaves all", "79:14", "around me I could hear the sounds of the", "79:17", "forest and these people in the", "79:19", "rainforest just hanging out talking this", "79:21", "it was totally uneventful nothing was", "79:23", "happening but they were talking in this", "79:25", "language that I absolutely knew what", "79:27", "they were saying they were going back", "79:28", "and forth and communicating and I was", "79:30", "following the conversation in their", "79:32", "language thinking in their language and", "79:33", "then I realized it and I woke up how do", "79:37", "you interpret that I think first of all", "79:41", "tripping balls right there's that", "79:43", "there's being in that tank on what I", "79:47", "think it was edible pot I've done a", "79:51", "bunch of different things in the tank", "79:52", "but mostly it's edible pot pot edibles", "79:55", "has a distinctly hallucinatory effect at", "79:59", "high doses especially when you close", "80:02", "your eyes and you're laying back and", "80:04", "just like just just letting visuals take", "80:07", "place also I think it's entirely", "80:10", "possible that we have genetic memory and", "80:12", "I think it's entirely possible that like", "80:16", "there's certain things that people pass", "80:18", "down to their children like there's", "80:20", "certain traits that my kids have that I", "80:22", "watching them and I go okay how do you", "80:25", "why are you so into this are you so into", "80:27", "this because you just happen to be into", "80:29", "this are you into this because you", "80:30", "because I'm into this and some are", "80:32", "another got into my genes and passed on", "80:34", "to your little tiny body and now you're", "80:36", "developing with this like hunger for", "80:38", "certain certain types of activities", "80:40", "literally in their cellular level of no", "80:44", "no we don't know what's transferred we", "80:46", "don't know how much of like what looks", "80:49", "people have certain instincts right", "80:50", "people are afraid of spiders afraid of", "80:52", "snakes why why is that it's probably", "80:54", "some memory probably somewhere along the", "80:57", "line some memory got transferred into", "80:59", "your DNA well the question is like how", "81:01", "much gets in there until I told my", "81:04", "nine-year-old daughter I'd I thought", "81:06", "probably very little I was probably just", "81:08", "like physical traits and that's it but", "81:10", "her mind is so much like my mind like", "81:13", "and especially her obsession with things", "81:15", "I've never seen a little kid so obsessed", "81:17", "with things like this is me and a", "81:19", "nine-year-old girl's body like this is", "81:20", "fucking crazy and talking to people that", "81:25", "have musical talent or people that have", "81:28", "artistic talent and their children seem", "81:30", "to have an aptitude for this like an", "81:32", "unusual aptitude almost as if they're", "81:34", "trying to remember it rather than learn", "81:36", "it oh I like what you just said I like", "81:39", "that's immature I think there's", "81:41", "something that gets trend I don't I", "81:43", "don't know how much of it is readable", "81:45", "data but I think there's so much", "81:47", "information that gets through yourselves", "81:49", "and then I think the child is faced with", "81:52", "their own day", "81:52", "right their own life experiences their", "81:54", "own genetics their own hormones and all", "81:57", "these different things that are", "81:58", "happening around them but I think", "82:00", "underneath all that it's entirely", "82:02", "possible that remains some very very", "82:05", "distant memories which is why people", "82:08", "survived as long as they did because you", "82:10", "could transfer some knowledge unto the", "82:12", "kids I think it's probably less today", "82:14", "than before because the world the world", "82:16", "so safe", "82:16", "everything's nerfed you know if to worry", "82:18", "about getting eaten by leopards like", "82:19", "it's it's a totally different", "82:20", "environment we live in it so less if it", "82:22", "gets in there but I think there's", "82:23", "probably still somewhere in the", "82:25", "operating system if you went into dass", "82:27", "and start sneaking around you'd find", "82:29", "some weird code from like different", "82:31", "languages that you spoke ten thousand", "82:33", "years ago or you know who knows whatever", "82:35", "life expect why are kids scared of", "82:38", "monsters those are another thing that", "82:39", "they were talking about once and one of", "82:41", "these things like they're scared of", "82:42", "monsters because monsters used to be a", "82:44", "real thing that you had to worry about", "82:45", "cuz they ate people like cats like", "82:48", "leopards and jaguars and shit like that", "82:50", "was a real problem so little kids", "82:52", "they're not scared of bullets or you", "82:54", "know they're scared of fucking monsters", "82:56", "that's what every little kids scared of", "82:58", "the dark and monsters because that's in", "83:00", "our genetic memory probably some", "83:02", "leftover shit from when we got eaten a", "83:04", "lot in trees yeah trees right so falling", "83:09", "and appreciation yeah both so is that", "83:13", "what you think happened like that you", "83:15", "kind of access to memory cuz I was going", "83:17", "more with like the what do you call it", "83:19", "collective unconscious like you were", "83:21", "seeing a present-day thing in another", "83:23", "part of the world I doubt it no you're", "83:26", "going back in your I think was just", "83:28", "imagination more than anything honestly", "83:30", "try to be really honest I think it was", "83:31", "imagination I think I just have a very", "83:33", "vivid imagination and it's particularly", "83:35", "when I was lit on some okay i I've read", "83:39", "a study where if something really", "83:43", "traumatic happens to the parent and I", "83:45", "don't know if this is animals or", "83:46", "whatever even if the baby animal is born", "83:50", "after this thing is over this traumatic", "83:52", "event they'll have a fear of that thing", "83:56", "mmm that was very poorly articulated I", "83:59", "think the pots like gone through me know", "84:01", "I know you saw I'm just like sort of I", "84:03", "think I know what you're talking about", "84:04", "there was a study that they did with", "84:05", "mice", "84:06", "and what they did with my says they", "84:07", "sprayed a citrus and aroma inside the", "84:11", "cage and then they electrocuted the feet", "84:12", "of the mice their children when they", "84:15", "smelled this is children that had not", "84:18", "been elected when they smell that citrus", "84:19", "aroma they had a heightened panic state", "84:21", "yeah yeah that's what it is yeah but", "84:24", "that's is that how they figured that out", "84:25", "because that seems I can explain that", "84:28", "with normal science that's easy right", "84:32", "because they have this sense well they", "84:36", "never they never experienced the", "84:38", "electrocution they smelled the smell", "84:40", "right but the smell never gave them a", "84:42", "heightened sense of awareness and my", "84:44", "fetus would be shocked oh you're saying", "84:46", "they weren't pregnant no no they weren't", "84:48", "pregnant oh this is before they're", "84:49", "pregnant", "84:50", "it's not even there right exactly okay", "84:52", "so what explains that genetic memory", "84:54", "it's a it's a piece of evidence that", "84:57", "points of genetic memory but it's one of", "84:59", "those things it's like if you don't", "85:00", "understand go back to das or C plus or", "85:03", "something like that some computer code I", "85:05", "don't understand it if I read it's just", "85:06", "gibberish to me or like those quantum", "85:08", "physics guys and write all that stuff", "85:09", "that's just gibberish so we might be", "85:11", "just getting that gibberish going what", "85:13", "is what's going on here", "85:14", "no one knows right we don't know one day", "85:16", "maybe we'll be able to read that", "85:17", "gibberish but right now we know there's", "85:19", "something getting passed down from these", "85:21", "mice so if the parent gets shocked", "85:24", "because they smell that thing and then", "85:25", "the kids who have nothing to do with it", "85:27", "they get shocked or they smell it and", "85:30", "they think they're gonna get shocked", "85:31", "something's being transferred to that", "85:32", "that's crazy", "85:33", "that means that we have components of", "85:35", "our parents like right now we're", "85:38", "reacting to stuff in our everyday life", "85:40", "our fears our worries our neuroses yeah", "85:42", "possibly things that our parents", "85:45", "experience it's entirely possible that", "85:47", "you didn't Orosz use of your parents", "85:49", "it's somehow or another transferred into", "85:51", "your body", "85:51", "whether or not you accept them as your", "85:53", "own because I'm adopted that means I", "85:55", "have two sets of neuroses going at once", "85:58", "I wonder doubling down on I wonder how", "86:01", "much of my adoptive parents gave you", "86:03", "sticks what is this Yehuda another", "86:06", "study's authors were was an early", "86:09", "researcher of trauma trauma and", "86:11", "heritability her research on Holocaust", "86:13", "survivors found that epigenetic change", "86:15", "is not the genes themselves but how they", "86:17", "are turned on and off by other molecules", "86:19", "could be passed down", "86:20", "two survivors children and change their", "86:22", "stress hormones what is that how does it", "86:26", "express itself though I not genes", "86:28", "themselves but how they are turned on", "86:30", "and off by other molecules could be", "86:32", "passed down so you're going to be", "86:34", "heightened they're gonna have a", "86:35", "heightened sensitivity to threat", "86:38", "probably probably they're gonna have", "86:41", "like a quicker response neurologically", "86:43", "well they say that about children that", "86:46", "are in the womb when their mother is", "86:48", "under extreme stress or violence sure no", "86:52", "but what freaks me out is it's not even", "86:55", "like a fetal baby that's reacting this", "86:57", "yeah like complete genetic material", "86:59", "transference yeah who knows I don't", "87:04", "think we know enough future science yeah", "87:06", "that's what you're into I'm way into", "87:08", "future science I wish we lived in the", "87:10", "future so that's where ghosts fit in I", "87:12", "think oh I mean future science I think I", "87:14", "just think time I think time is a", "87:17", "illusion I think that I'm more do you", "87:21", "ever see interstellar yes I'm more in", "87:24", "that zone hmm that's macked of good", "87:28", "science yes so when you say times an", "87:33", "illusion you mean like the watch is real", "87:36", "like if it says 4:30 that's when the", "87:37", "movie starts right that's all real no", "87:40", "that's just coordination mmm that's it's", "87:43", "it's in within our species we're", "87:45", "coordinating together we're working as", "87:47", "an ant colony we're sending signals", "87:49", "which happened to be time signals we're", "87:51", "using math to coordinate but if you go",

is the counting of that", "88:03", "time doesn't mean anything doesn't mean", "88:06", "anything no it doesn't mean anything but", "88:08", "if someone's five minutes late you like", "88:09", "bitch you're five minutes late", "88:12", "well I'm never mad about that because", "88:14", "I'm always late okay hmm that's", "88:18", "interesting well the only time", "88:21", "supposedly is now and everything else is", "88:23", "just our pathetic attempts at measuring", "88:25", "it and trying to that's just", "88:27", "coordination on like you know people", "88:29", "like that's all we're doing
