"46:36", "this is the genius of the people who", "46:38", "break his shape stories over there Feige", "46:42", "and his team as they go he's Hulk and", "46:44", "he's not hulkees Hulk it's a big battle", "46:46", "always so conflicted what if he could", "46:48", "meet himself in the middle and then what", "46:52", "corner have we painted ourselves in by", "46:54", "having him meet himself in the middle", "46:56", "because then you can't ever if that", "46:58", "doesn't work you can't go back to the", "46:59", "way it was you've done it or you can go", "47:00", "back to the way it was so I just think", "47:03", "that the the real genius of the Marvel", "47:05", "creative team is they and the Russo", "47:07", "brothers who did the last few Avengers", "47:11", "infinity war and end games ago we love", "47:13", "writing ourselves into a corner we love", "47:15", "it because then it it activates all of", "47:19", "those how do we get out of purgatory", "47:21", "juices and then you get the next right", "47:23", "idea now when you guys sit down and when", "47:28", "you first receive a script for one of", "47:29", "these things do they consult with you do", "47:33", "they discuss this with you did they just", "47:34", "lay it out and say this is this is the", "47:37", "character arced how do you how do you", "47:38", "feel about this what do you think yeah", "47:40", "and and but it's changed over time I", "47:43", "think if you're one of the folks has", "47:45", "their standalone movies like Scarlett", "47:47", "has Black Widow coming out I think you", "47:49", "take a I would you take a bit of a", "47:51", "different attack in how much meaning I", "47:56", "think that phrase the legal phrase for", "47:59", "actors and studios is meaningful", "48:00", "consultation not script approval because", "48:04", "then anybody could hold the studio", "48:07", "hostage because I don't approve this", "48:09", "thirty million dollars that you're", "48:11", "trying to spend right", "48:12", "so your schedules fine when you say I", "48:14", "don't approve I picture a bathrobe and I", "48:16", "pictured fine china and teacups that's", "48:19", "how I picture I don't approve and then", "48:20", "just storming off I've had my moments", "48:23", "too because I'm so passionate about", "48:25", "story but again after more seat time", "48:29", "with the same people and new people", "48:31", "coming in and getting a pretty brutal", "48:34", "education on what kind of process these", "48:39", "movies require you you you just start", "48:42", "trusting more that they're thinking on", "48:46", "your behalf and also little things are", "48:49", "easy to change big things become a", "48:52", "inconvenience to the higher good and at", "48:55", "what point do you want to pull the air", "48:59", "brake on something where the the trains", "49:01", "you know already leaving the station", "49:04", "well I would imagine it would be a fine", "49:06", "line that they have they want the the", "49:09", "actor to be comfortable with the", "49:11", "character and they want some and maybe", "49:13", "some feedback would be beneficial but", "49:16", "they're also they have a path the vision", "49:18", "that they've created yeah they would", "49:19", "like to see you somehow or another at", "49:21", "least morph slightly to get on this path", "49:25", "yeah yeah and by the way after I had my", "49:28", "second round of kids with Susan I became", "49:31", "both artistically I had a bit of a", "49:35", "Renaissance when I was doing the third", "49:37", "Ironman and then after that too I was", "49:40", "like well now I'm gonna do this Avengers", "49:42", "and there's so many moving parts and", "49:43", "it's so difficult just to get all these", "49:45",

imagine when you're involved in", "50:14", "something that's so epic when it's", "50:16", "actually over it probably almost fien", "50:18", "seems surreal because the production is", "50:20", "so massive there's so many moving pieces", "50:22", "there's so many special effects so many", "50:24", "things that you you", "50:25", "to sort of visualize while you're doing", "50:27", "it and then after it's all over you're", "50:31", "done and what is it like what is a big", "50:34", "Avengers movie how many months are you", "50:36", "involved in this well I mean it could be", "50:41", "some
