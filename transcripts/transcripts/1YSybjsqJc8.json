Coyotes came", "03:09", "from how they're moving around yeah and", "03:11", "so it's nice to have something like", "03:13", "Dan's book to kind of reference people", "03:14", "to I think most people in the downtown", "03:17", "LA probably welcome something like a", "03:18", "coyote cuz it's kind of cool you don't", "03:20", "have this thing I can get around as long", "03:23", "as you don't have a dog or a cat that", "03:24", "it's Natchez yeah and that's definitely", "03:26", "the case a lot of people think it's cool", "03:27", "but they do cause problems I'm actually", "03:29", "dealing with one in Silver Lake", "03:30", "neighborhood that keeps going up to", "03:32", "people walking their dogs and trying to", "03:34", "it's got a den in somebody's backyard is", "03:36", "actually dinning under their deck so the", "03:38", "decks open and she put our seven pups", "03:41", "underneath his den whoa yeah so it's", "03:43", "pretty crazy but she was basically but", "03:46", "he gets close

with coyotes because they're", "03:55", "trying to protect their dens I mean", "03:56", "we're all obviously protective of our", "03:57", "offsprings right so they think that the", "04:00", "dog is going to find the pups and kill", "04:02", "them or something I mean we don't really", "04:04", "know why they're doing it we assume", "04:05", "that's probably the case they come up", "04:07", "and the most the attacks have been where", "04:09", "they just come up behind the dog and", "04:10", "start trying to like nip it it's back", "04:11", "and one the dog the people move on", "04:13", "people freak out as far as I know there", "04:16", "hasn't been anywhere that I would", "04:17", "actually like draw blood on the dog so", "04:19", "it's almost more like it's like get the", "04:20", "hell out of here right so they're just", "04:22", "scaring them they're not trying to", "04:23", "they're not actually being predators", "04:25", "that's what it seems like for the most", "04:27", "part I mean", "04:27", "definitely do kill little dogs yeah and", "04:29", "occasionally end up fighting with big", "04:30", "dogs as well but that's that's rare Wow", "04:33", "so these what are they eating like this", "04:36", "especially the one in downtown yeah so", "04:38", "that's that's interesting we've actually", "04:40", "been doing this study using it working", "04:41", "with a bunch of citizen scientists and I", "04:43", "don't know if that's the story you read", "04:44", "or not but we're basically having people", "04:46", "collect coyote scat from around downtown", "04:48", "LA and we're actually breaking the", "04:49", "Coyotes got up to look what's in it and", "04:51", "we're seeing a huge variety of things I", "04:53", "mean lots of fruits and stuff they're", "04:55", "actually big-time and vegetative", "04:57", "vegetation type stuff a lot of fruits in", "04:59", "an urban environment obviously we got", "05:00", "peaches and plums and all kinds of crazy", "05:03", "fruiting stuff that they take advantage", "05:04", "of but they're also eating rats and", "05:06", "squirrels cats insects we seen things", "05:11", "like earwigs and those big old potato", "05:14", "bugs and you can see I mean there's", "05:15", "almost anything you could think of", "05:17", "they're taking advantage of human trash", "05:19", "well I I've had him in my yard for a", "05:22", "long time and one of the things that", "05:23", "surprised me is how much coyote scat", "05:25", "that I find with berries in it like I", "05:27", "didn't know that they were omnivores I", "05:29", "mean they were they really are", "05:30", "omnivorous then it's not like like a dog", "05:33", "or a cat I mean they pretty much", "05:36", "everything yeah I mean coyotes can take", "05:37", "advantage and that's why they're able to", "05:38", "live amongst us I mean cuz even when", "05:40", "there's not a lot of prey available they", "05:41", "do they're able to take advantage of", "05:43", "these different fruiting trees yeah you", "05:45", "know I was talking with a friend about", "05:47", "it and he was saying that he hates them", "05:49", "and no he wants to kill them all and all", "05:51", "the stuff and I was saying but yeah but", "05:52", "ever notice that you don't see any rats", "05:54", "like we hardly have any rats like it's", "05:58", "so rare that you see a rat or a mouse in", "06:00", "my area and I think a big part of that", "06:03", "is because you hear coyotes all the time", "06:04", "and I think they're eating them all I", "06:06", "mean they definitely take advantage I", "06:07", "mean there's other predators too not", "06:09", "sure where you live exact howls and", "06:11", "hawks and bobcats", "06:12", "yeah and all those different things", "06:13", "definitely yeah edge of those prey as", "06:15", "well but yeah coyotes I mean they're", "06:17", "amazing you there are they are really", "06:19", "are fast any animal so this this one", "06:21", "that got to downtown LA do you know like", "06:24", "when it arrived I don't know when it", "06:26", "arrived so I I kind of drove through", "06:29", "there looking to see where I might be", "06:31", "able to call her a few animals so we", "06:32", "could kind of see what's going on and", "06:34", "how these animals are persisting down", "06:35", "there I mean actually do that how do I", "06:39", "see if we're there persist no see caller", "06:40", "how do i collar them so first we have to", "06:43", "capture them so we'll put out traps", "06:44", "we'll capture them and then once I get", "06:46", "them in a trap I'll go out with a pole", "06:49", "I'll pin them to the ground and then", "06:51", "I'll hold them down Jesus I'll put a", "06:53", "muzzle on them and hold their feet", "06:54", "together and then we'll throw a collar", "06:56", "on them we'll take blood to look for", "06:59", "disease you don't train Jose we don't", "07:01", "tranquilize them wow that's crazy yeah", "07:03", "they actually go very docile they're", "07:05", "like a dog once you kind of show them", "07:06", "that you're the dominant dang they they", "07:08", "kind of just lay over and you start to", "07:09", "be careful obviously they can turn and", "07:11", "bite you if you don't muzzle them right", "07:12", "but usually once you get them down that", "07:14", "first time they usually just lay there", "07:16", "until you're done no kidding and it", "07:18", "usually takes me somewhere 35 40 minutes", "07:20", "to do the whole thing and they just lay", "07:22", "there they're not fighting me video of", "07:25", "that uh I'm sure I do I want to see that", "07:28", "that's gotta be a trip ya know I would", "07:31", "think that they would be like a wild cat", "07:33", "like I've had a feral cat before um and", "07:36", "I had her when she was a kitten or he", "07:37", "rather when he was a kitten and he was", "07:40", "like a spaz like you couldn't even hold", "07:42", "on to him you'd freak out climb the", "07:44", "curtains and hiss and sputter on you and", "07:46", "that was like a little domestic cat that", "07:48", "was born outside oh yeah we do drug any", "07:51", "of our cats we catch so we catch Bobcats", "07:53", "it's an assignee that we're doing a lot", "07:55", "of we've actually had a bobcat project", "07:57", "going on since 1996 and so we've been", "08:00", "calling those guys for a long time", "08:01", "they're not docile they're not docile we", "08:03", "don't trust them raccoons or another", "08:05", "species you don't handle those guys", "08:06", "undrugged", "08:07", "oh yeah I would imagine they'll make you", "08:09", "pay the price and that crazy like people", "08:11", "don't realize that raccoons or predators", "08:13", "yeah well they're definitely omnivores", "08:15", "like just like the Coyotes are they", "08:17", "actually eat a lot of fruit and stuff", "08:18", "they take I mean part of them living in", "08:20", "an urban environment is they're just", "08:21", "taken a massive advantage of our garbage", "08:24", "right I Koons just I mean we've seen", "08:26", "amazing photos of like 1314 raccoons and", "08:28", "one garbage can all feasting down", "08:31", "I have chickens in my backyard and this", "08:33", "one raccoon was by my chicken coop the", "08:36", "other day and I flashed a light on him", "08:38", "and he walked towards the light I was", "08:40", "like look at this cocky bitch he just", "08:43", "started walking at me and I got nervous", "08:44", "I was like I don't have a weapon on me", "08:46", "and nothing I thought a flashlight he'd", "08:47", "be like well let me get out of here", "08:48", "he's just looking right at the", "08:50", "flashlight walking towards me you know", "08:52", "trying to get to the chicken coop", "08:54", "you'd be amazed how many people feed", "08:55", "them because they're so dang cute right", "08:58", "big old masks on people are like oh", "09:00", "they're starving out there they can't", "09:01", "find their own food and so they feel", "09:02", "like they need to feed them and see the", "09:04", "Coyotes - its people feel like these", "09:06", "animals can't fend for themselves which", "09:07", "is ridiculous because they're not able", "09:10", "to make it there because we're feeding", "09:11", "them they're making it because there's", "09:13", "resources for them to take advantage of", "09:15", "yeah I would imagine they probably play", "09:17", "I mean like I said I think in my", "09:18", "neighborhood they do play an important", "09:21", "part of keeping the rodent population", "09:22", "down but in downtown there's got to be a", "09:25", "ton of rodents as well I mean downtown", "09:27", "for people don't know is like the only", "09:29", "area in all of LA that really looks like", "09:32", "a city yeah definitely I mean that like", "09:35", "I said I drove through there I mean", "09:36", "after tracking coyotes in Chicago I", "09:37", "didn't think they'd be in some there is", "09:39", "they are in LA there seemed to be", "09:41", "everywhere I look I get photos of", "09:43", "coyotes on our cameras or get people", "09:45", "reporting them to us and this one that's", "09:47", "in downtown is just a single Keio by", "09:49", "herself no actually she's got a whole", "09:51", "pack so I call her her and then within a", "09:54", "couple she was actually lactating when I", "09:56", "caught her so I know she had pups and", "09:57", "then we ended up seeing her with five", "10:01", "pups probably a week later and there was", "10:04", "actually a ambulance that drove by and", "10:07", "she just started howling and all the", "10:09", "pups were out there yipping and this is", "10:10", "all like in this little vacant lot", "10:11", "between two houses Wow so they just find", "10:15", "these areas where people aren't yeah and", "10:18", "so before we collared them the one thing", "10:19", "I always heard is oh the Coyotes are", "10:20", "coming in from Griffith Park or they're", "10:22", "coming in from Elysian Park and coming", "10:23", "into our communities and they're just", "10:25", "here for a night or two night causing", "10:26", "problems and leaving well that's not", "10:28", "what we're seeing definitely once we", "10:29", "threw these colors on these animals were", "10:31", "like no they've got pretty small home", "10:33", "ranges they're kind of living just in", "10:35", "the urban environment they're not going", "10:36", "back and forth one of the thing with us", "10:38", "so do you feel like it's a good thing or", "10:42", "a bad thing to have them around or just", "10:43", "a thing I think it's just a thing I mean", "10:46", "depends on your perspective I think it's", "10:49", "bad when people think we need to feed", "10:51", "them right to do these things like to", "10:53", "encourage them and make them more", "10:54", "comfortable with us that's not a good", "10:56", "thing because that's when bites and that", "10:57", "kind of stuff happen but if when it", "11:00", "comes to the Coyotes and stuff living in", "11:02", "these urban environments it's really all", "11:03", "about us it's more about managing people", "11:05", "getting people to quit feeding them or", "11:07", "quit", "11:08", "one thing I encourage people do scare", "11:09", "the stupid coyote off thing because", "11:11", "there's lots of people that have little", "11:14", "issues that occur with the Coyotes their", "11:16", "cats get taken or the coyote stark just", "11:18", "sitting there watching them I had", "11:19", "somebody complain recently because the", "11:20", "kayo was sitting behind their yard", "11:21", "looking at their wife in the jacuzzi", "11:23", "know Jesus Christ", "11:24", "so coyotes a pervert exactly so it's", "11:27", "like come on like all he has to do if he", "11:30", "really doesn't want it there go back", "11:31", "there run the thing off signal on you", "11:33", "and tell you that a kayo staring at", "11:35", "their wife yeah you'd be amazed the", "11:36", "calls we get about coyotes people just", "11:39", "people are still not comfortable and", "11:40", "being there even though they've been", "11:41", "there for a long time it's just people", "11:44", "cannot get comfort with idea of there", "11:45", "being a medium-sized predator in these", "11:48", "urban environments they're like the", "11:49", "perfect size to almost get away with it", "11:52", "too you know like they it's not like a", "11:54", "wolf like if a wolf was around everybody", "11:55", "be freaking out like it's too big yeah", "11:57", "coyotes like you know 40 pounds", "12:00", "something like that and that's a pit",

usually just kill them that's", "21:05", "interesting so do they kill them to", "21:07", "bring the females to estrus or they do", "21:09", "them just because their competition we", "21:11", "believe it just because it's competition", "21:12", "because they're usually killing those", "21:13", "yearling okay now so they tell once", "21:16", "they're independent exactly so and they", "21:19", "also

"26:05", "they almost always eat what they kill", "26:07", "it's just when they kill something in a", "26:09", "farm they usually end up being", "26:10", "uncomfortable afterwards because we come", "26:12", "in we see the situation things change", "26:14", "and so they don't come back because", "26:15", "they'll feed on a deer for a week or", "26:17", "more right so it's it's I think it's", "26:18", "more of a factor when they leave those", "26:20", "things it's more that they just also", "26:21", "like oh crap what I do I gotta get out", "26:24", "of here why they kill 37 then they just", "26:26", "pray drive I mean they can't help", "26:28", "themselves", "26:28", "yeah they get in there's times when they", "26:30", "get in pins with bigger animals to", "26:31", "things like llamas and stuff where", "26:33", "they'll end up killing multiple animals", "26:35", "yeah cuz they get in this pin and then", "26:37", "all suddenly they're jumping around", "26:38", "making all these noises and so then the", "26:40", "animals get excited", "26:41", "I mean just like a doll dogs are getting", "26:43", "after chickens also and the dog goes in", "26:45", "and kills the whole

that the name of it P", "26:56", "4045 guessing if that's what you're", "26:58", "talking about is that the one that", "26:59", "killed the bunch of llamas and the woman", "27:01", "got a depredation permit to kill the", "27:04", "mountain lion then people freaked out", "27:05", "started sending her death threats yeah", "27:07", "got a little out of control yeah it's", "27:09", "like it was really creepy listening to", "27:10", "this woman's position because she didn't", "27:12", "know what to do cuz she's you know she", "27:14", "lives there", "27:15", "she's got this farm and this big ol cat", "27:18", "this keeps coming in fuckin up like 10", "27:20", "llamas yeah in a setting yeah so US a", "27:24", "National Wildlife Federation actually", "27:25", "started working with her to try to help", "27:26", "pin or animals up better because a lot", "27:28", "of it just comes to making sure your", "27:29", "animals are secure at night is that what", "27:31", "it is like you have to figure out a way", "27:32", "to close the area so the mountain lion", "27:34", "can't get into exactly and should take", "27:36", "anything that complicated we actually", "27:38", "held a workshop for people in the local", "27:40", "vicinity and we'll be holding more to", "27:42", "teach livestock owners how to secure", "27:44", "their animals so that that stuff doesn't", "27:45", "happen there's a way they can do", "27:48", "something that like emits a sound or", "27:50", "something that scares them off so there", "27:53", "are some devices out there that are", "27:54", "being tested and being used in some", "27:56", "vicinities but nothing's 100% the", "27:59", "problem with a lot of devices you've got", "28:00", "livestock moving around so they're going", "28:01", "to be triggering the devices all night", "28:03", "and so it's it's kind of a tough", "28:06", "situation the best thing is to try to", "28:07", "pin the animals up so you have to put", "28:10", "something with a roof on it so the", "28:11", "mountain lion can't get in over the top", "28:12", "exactly so when you're talking about an", "28:15", "animal like that like when they date", "28:18", "sometimes they capture them and then", "28:19", "they move them to a new area right um", "28:22", "that is very rare to happen is it really", "28:26", "yeah like when we capture animals we", "28:28", "don't move anybody you just let them go", "28:30", "right back to where they are we call", "28:31", "them we take blood we do what we need to", "28:33", "do to them and then we just let them go", "28:35", "right there so is the idea like mess", "28:37", "with them as little as possible exactly", "28:39", "yep we didn't have to capture them we", "28:41", "wouldn't capture them we would just", "28:42", "throw if there was a way to get a collar", "28:43", "on the animal without touching it we", "28:45", "would do that like maybe a dart that", "28:46", "shoots a GPS unit in them or something", "28:48", "yeah whatever the technology is if it", "28:50", "ever comes up that way most wildlife", "28:52", "people would prefer because the least we", "28:53", "have to do to them the more work", "28:54", "understand their writers yeah I would", "28:56", "imagine this cat in Griffith Park you", "28:58", "said it's been captured three times yeah", "29:00", "that's kind of crazy", "29:01", "I even before I can't remember I'm not", "29:03", "like I said I'm not a guy that does all", "29:04", "the lion work so I just help out the cat", "29:06", "must be like Jesus Christ they got me", "29:08", "again", "29:08", "I guess brother like I'm so tired of", "29:12", "wearing the stupid jewelry they keep", "29:13", "putting on me yeah well I don't know you", "29:14", "might have saw the pictures too where he", "29:16", "got he was really sick with mange oh", "29:18", "yeah that's right and so they got a", "29:21", "medication so we caught him and we have", "29:23", "a topical medication that we can give", "29:25", "animals we do it to bobcats and stuff so", "29:27", "what we found with this mange disease is", "29:30", "that it's caused by a rodenticides", "29:32", "so all these rat poisons we put out", "29:34",

"29:42", "why these animals get sick oh is that", "29:44", "him right there with mange yep yeah", "29:46", "that's fascinating that is a real issue", "29:49", "with people poisoning these animals so", "29:52", "that it also affects owls apparently", "29:54", "that rat poison is causing a drop in the", "29:58", "owl population because the owls are", "29:59", "getting a whole these rats that are sick", "30:01", "from the oh that's interesting", "30:03", "yeah well it's amazing I mean to think", "30:04", "of a mountain lion getting rat poison", "30:06", "it's not like their other hunting rats", "30:07", "right but it's because they're killing", "30:09", "the Coyotes that thinner that are eating", "30:11", "the rats that are sick that's happening", "30:13", "so rub mine wouldn't eat a rat I mean", "30:16", "they might but for them to eat enough", "30:17", "rats they're not just sitting there", "30:18", "focusing on rats it's really so big", "30:20", "great source for right so they're", "30:22", "they're definitely focusing more on the", "30:24", "Coyotes in the bigger prey I can't", "30:26", "believe there's that many mountain lions", "30:28", "in Santa Monica Mountains that's crazy", "30:30", "yeah and the these are collared mountain", "30:33", "lions correct not all of them there's", "30:35", "definitely some out there that are", "30:36", "uncoloured we can only get what we can", "30:38", "capture so it's so like when you make an", "30:40", "estimate of like would you say 15 is", "30:42", "that we just said that we think that's", "30:43", "our upper size limit how many of them", "30:46", "are collared um I think right now we're", "30:49", "around 8 or 9 yeah I wish I was Jeff was", "30:52", "in here he can answer these questions a", "30:53", "lot better than Meeks like I said I'm go", "30:55", "get Jeff in here next time yeah it's", "30:57", "it's so fascinating because California", "30:59", "is such a unique area in that we are", "31:01", "very urban you know but we're real", "31:04", "spread out and we've got the Santa", "31:07", "Monica Mountains", "31:08", "right there like in Topanga right there", "31:11", "I mean to pay I have a buddy lives in", "31:13", "Topanga you go in his backyard you would", "31:15", "swear to god you're in Colorado or", "31:16", "something I mean just it seems like the", "31:18", "wilderness ya know the mountains are", "31:20", "amazing and it's 155 thousand acres Oh", "31:23", "Jamie's got a map be pulled up of all", "31:25", "the mountain lines", "31:26", "ah look at them all just so obviously", "31:28", "the the Santa Monica Mountains are just", "31:30", "there south of the 101 basically so the", "31:34", "park is basically from the Hollywood", "31:35", "Hills out to Point Mugu and it", "31:37", "incorporates most of Malibu and then it", "31:39", "goes a little bit up in the Simi Hills", "31:41", "but the mountains themselves are mostly", "31:43", "south of 101 this is such a unique place", "31:45", "to live", "31:46", "that we're so sort of surrounded by", "31:48", "nature in a lot of ways and there's so", "31:51", "many different places like you could go", "31:52", "to

it's pretty cool", "32:02", "it's pretty cool but people are super", "32:05", "uncomfortable with the fact that this", "32:07", "wildlife sort of interfaces with our", "32:11", "urban environment and that's where guys", "32:13", "like you come in right yeah I mean we're", "32:15", "we're hoping to help reduce some of", "32:16", "these conflicts and a lot of it comes to", "32:18", "what we do it's not so much with animals", "32:20", "I mean with coyotes a huge amount of the", "32:22", "issues are because somebody next door to", "32:24", "use feeding them and so the Coyotes", "32:25", "hanging around is really common like the", "32:27", "people leave out food yeah sometimes", "32:29", "it's intentional sometimes it's not like", "32:31", "feeding your dog outside it's never a", "32:32", "good idea right having fruit trees in", "32:34", "your backyard that are just dropping", "32:35", "fruit constantly and no one's picking it", "32:37", "up or cleaning it up that's all", "32:39", "attractant so it's all bringing in", "32:40", "coyotes raccoons possums skunks all", "32:43", "these animals are coming in take", "32:44", "advantage of that stuff so do you think", "32:46", "they eat olives uh we've seen olives", "32:49", "probably would take advantage um here", "32:51", "and there but I don't think it's like a", "32:52", "super big food source forum I haven't", "32:54", "seen any spots so we've been doing this", "32:56", "diet study for a little while now and", "32:57", "olives are not one that pops up", "32:59", "regularly because my dogs eat them", "33:01", "that's why I'm asking my dogs catch them", "33:02", "when they fall out of trees and it's the", "33:04", "same yard obviously where the Coyotes", "33:06", "had been visiting yeah I mean I wouldn't", "33:08", "rule it out but definitely few have", "33:09", "anything like figs we find tons of figs", "33:12", "and bigad yeah so they really like figs", "33:14", "they do when figs fruit twice a year a", "33:16", "lot of the varieties of figs and so", "33:18", "they're there a lot so that", "33:20", "it's just kind of learn to key in on", "33:22", "them okay and probably a lot of calories", "33:24", "there too former exactly what are those", "33:26", "little tiny red berries that they like", "33:28", "to eat pyracantha maybe as though it is", "33:30", "I think so now it's not even edible to", "33:32", "humans right not I don't think so but", "33:34", "caios can eat them yeah I mean whether", "33:37", "it's edible to us or whether we would", "33:38", "want to eat them Raburn question I guess", "33:40", "yeah they're all there grinding exactly", "33:43", "they're eating a lot of things that we", "33:44", "would not touch yeah no kidding I mean", "33:46", "they they golf pick stuff up off the", "33:48", "road nasty little it looks like just", "33:51", "putty on the road I've seen them grab", "33:52", "stuff no actually I mean coyotes they're", "33:55", "just they're crazy I mean there's a lot", "33:56", "of these talk about Katie's going after", "33:58", "cats and all that and there's no", "33:59", "question they eat cats I've seen them", "34:00", "one of our collared animals was actually", "34:02", "eating a cat did and two of its pack", "34:04", "mates were sitting there just eating", "34:05", "this cat in somebody's front yard which", "34:07", "I'd never seen I knew they ate them have", "34:09", "you seen that video but of the coyote", "34:11", "the cat that someone captured in Los", "34:13", "Angeles I don't think so it's a great", "34:16", "video because these people from their", "34:18", "car are filming this coyote that's right", "34:20", "they're on the street in busy LA and", "34:22", "it's just staring at people chewing on", "34:24", "this cat yeah that's like Jesus Christ", "34:27", "we played it for Dan Flores and Dan has", "34:29", "the opinion he's of the opinion that a", "34:31", "lot of these cats that are getting", "34:34", "killed by these coyotes like here's some", "34:36", "kayo it's just wandering across the", "34:38", "street I mean this is really crazy", "34:39", "because this is as urban as it gets", "34:42", "I mean busy street and this coyotes just", "34:45", "hanging out and so these people follow", "34:47", "this coyote all around the street does", "34:49", "it look at that has a caller what I see", "34:50", "I could no no caller ID but it Dan", "34:54", "thinks that the Coyotes are eating the", "34:57", "cats because they're competitive", "34:58", "predators um so that has definitely been", "35:02", "seen with things like focuses there is", "35:05", "so just chillin eating a cat right in", "35:09", "front everybody I mean that's crazy did", "35:12", "they actually see it I'm guessing they", "35:14", "didn't see it actually catch thing no", "35:15", "because the cat is stiff yeah so stiff", "35:17", "that cat is that cat looks like it's", "35:18", "been dead for quite a while but he's", "35:20", "just chewing on that cat front everybody", "35:22", "that Kyle actually you see how its face", "35:24", "looks kind of bold and I mean how I", "35:26", "actually have mange and you think that", "35:27", "could be from rat poison uh with the", "35:29", "Coyotes it's a little more complicated", "35:31", "in that we think that it's a different", "35:33", "type of mange", "35:34", "so we don't think that's directly tied", "35:37", "to rat poisons it could be still but", "35:38", "where does it's kind of uncertain with", "35:40", "those guys and some of it is because of", "35:41", "bugs as well right so mange is actually", "35:44", "caused by a mite yeah and it just", "35:46", "irritates their skin and they end up", "35:47", "scratching their own fur off oh that's", "35:49", "it yeah really yeah I thought it just", "35:52", "fell look at that one cats like huh", "35:53", "that's my friend", "35:55", "dude that cat is so crazy he's just", "35:58", "sitting there watching this coyote yeah", "36:00", "so what a dumb cat well I saw a cat in", "36:04", "the middle of a street a coyote walking", "36:06", "down the street I thought it was a bag", "36:07", "of garbage I was about a hundred yards", "36:09", "away and I've seen her watching sky oh", "36:10", "go to it I was like cats can get in this", "36:12", "garbage next thing I know this coyote", "36:13", "circles at three times walks off all", "36:16", "something jumps up and walks away", "36:18", "I was like whoa did I just see that wow", "36:21", "do not believe it like because even like", "36:23", "I know it's complicated but I was like", "36:24", "that was a pretty easy prey they could", "36:27", "have just grabbed it so Coyotes much", "36:29", "faster than Kass is that what it is well", "36:31", "that's an area Dean has to be faster the", "36:32", "cat was just laying there right like it", "36:34", "could have grabbed it at any point you", "36:36", "know wonder why the cat felt calm enough", "36:38", "to do that yeah I don't know and yio", "36:40", "didn't go after it I have no idea I", "36:41", "think it's just it's just not that", "36:43", "simple that they go after every single", "36:44", "cat yeah well they obviously don't right", "36:47", "now now you so you say that it is fairly", "36:50", "common that people feed them it is I've", "36:53", "just with tracking these animals I've", "36:55", "been to a bunch of places where people", "36:56", "feel like they need to put dog food or", "36:57", "cat food out on the street just for the", "36:59", "Coyotes or the skunks or the raccoons or", "37:01", "whatever they're feeding something", "37:03", "intentionally out there and then the", "37:04", "Coyotes are taken advantage and you talk", "37:06", "to these people do you have to have so I", "37:08", "will occasionally at usually I just tell", "37:10", "Animal Services about it and they'll", "37:12", "talk to them or if it's somebody I'm", "37:13", "like already having some sort of", "37:15", "communication with I'll definitely be", "37:16", "like yeah you don't really need to feed", "37:17", "these guys they're they're doing fine on", "37:19", "their own yeah all you're doing is", "37:21", "encouraging them to come here yeah do", "37:23", "they get that do you deal with some", "37:24", "nutty animal people that don't get that", "37:26", "yeah we definitely deal with some people", "37:27", "that don't understand they feel like", "37:30", "these animals are gonna starve to death", "37:31", "or or die of dehydration if they don't", "37:33", "put that bowl of water outdoors", "37:35", "so crazy so yeah Dan Flores had a woman", "37:38", "who came to him and was doing a", "37:40", "documentary on saving the coyote yeah", "37:43", "and he was like I don't think you", "37:45", "understand like they're doing great", "37:47", "yeah they've expanded their range", "37:49", "incredibly like they're living in every", "37:51", "big city around me from New York Chicago", "37:54", "Toronto", "37:56", "yeah that's sane yeah it's crazy they're", "37:59", "everywhere", "37:59", "yeah they literally are in every state", "38:01", "in every city in the entire country", "38:03", "except Hawaii except why yep but so what", "38:06", "that is so bizarre that to think that", "38:08", "they're in Queens", "38:09", "there they found them in the Bronx yeah", "38:12", "what's amazing they've expanded their", "38:13", "range over fairly short time span - yeah", "38:16", "really just since Europeans have been", "38:17", "here that they've been able to kind of", "38:18", "expand out and do that and that's", "38:20", "through all this time I was trying to", "38:21", "kill them and all that mm-hmm and so I", "38:24", "get a lot of people that want to remove", "38:25", "coyotes from the urban environments I'm", "38:27", "like well we've been trying to do that", "38:28", "for a long time and it's not working", "38:30", "what is the solution then the solution", "38:32", "is just to try to sort of mitigate their", "38:34", "impact on us I think we need to change", "38:36", "what we do yeah I mean it's about not", "38:38", "making sure we don't have food out there", "38:39", "I mean if the more food they have it's", "38:42", "been showing coyotes can increase their", "38:43", "litter sizes and so they produce more", "38:45", "coyotes and so it's it's really about", "38:48", "trying to reduce the amount of food that", "38:49", "we are responsible for that's also what", "38:52", "I've read in Dan Flores book that the", "38:54", "more we impact the Coyotes as far as", "38:56", "like people trying to push them out and", "38:58", "pressure them the more they produce", "39:00", "extra babies like especially if they do", "39:04", "that roll call thing when they scream", "39:06", "out in the 90 hearing which is amazing", "39:08", "that is one of my favorite things about", "39:09", "Cairo its man when I'm out at night in", "39:12", "like you know like you're sitting on the", "39:13", "deck like having a cup of coffee or", "39:15", "something here you like wow this is wild", "39:19", "like they're really out here like", "39:22", "grinding that makes you feel you're", "39:24", "actually out in the wild a little yeah a", "39:25", "little bit you know like you're sitting", "39:28", "on your deck that's not in the music", "39:30", "exactly yeah I have to going off yeah", "39:32", "drinking a nice cup of coffee or", "39:34", "something it's just um it's just it's", "39:36", "such a unique relationship that we have", "39:39", "with that one predator where it's like I", "39:42", "like them around like I would be really", "39:44", "weird if that was a you know any other", "39:47", "kind of like scary predator but Kyle", "39:50", "it's are kind of cool to have around", "39:51", "yeah yeah I mean definitely I think the", "39:54", "same way a lot of people may not feel", "39:56", "quite the same when they're doing in", "39:58", "their backyard but", "40:00", "I don't know yeah I get that yeah I do", "40:02", "too I mean I am I'm a dog lover I've got", "40:05", "chickens I've got all these things that", "40:06", "coyotes could ya infect me as well but I", "40:09", "also realize that there's things I can", "40:10", "do to make sure that they're not going", "40:12", "to get to my chickens or they're not", "40:14", "going to look at my dogs well I have a", "40:15", "puppy right now that's my my big fear is", "40:18", "because I have a Golden Retriever puppy", "40:20", "and he is like golden retrievers owner", "40:23", "if you ever had one they they are like", "40:24", "the most non dog dogs like they don't", "40:27", "bark at anybody they're terrible", "40:29", "watchdogs they love everybody and they", "40:31", "just have zero killer instinct like zero", "40:35", "they're just sweet hearts and I'm just", "40:38", "worried that he's going to get jacked", "40:39", "yeah I mean I would definitely keep them", "40:41", "secure until he gets up to that forty", "40:43", "fifty pound range right there they're", "40:44", "generally pretty safe yeah so now they", "40:47", "do sometimes ambush them though right", "40:50", "that happens it's rare usually most", "40:53", "attacks are smaller dogs however there", "40:56", "are definitely cases where they've gone", "40:57", "even after something as big as your", "40:58", "Mastiff that's not raised I mean it's", "41:00", "pretty rare that happens the whole", "41:03", "coyote dog thing is complicated I bet", "41:05", "you if you googled dogs and coyotes", "41:06", "playing on YouTube you would find a", "41:09", "dozen videos very quickly yeah because", "41:12", "we've actually looked at some of that", "41:13", "and it's just like that relationships", "41:14", "not as simple is this like they're going", "41:16", "to go after the dogs no they play around", "41:18", "together but then they'll kill them and", "41:20", "eat them yeah it's just like what kind", "41:22", "of relationship do we have man yeah well", "41:25", "and we don't know how often they", "41:27", "actually eat them we think sometimes", "41:28", "they just kill them and carry them off", "41:29", "because that same thing they do with", "41:31", "foxes really yeah so like gray foxes and", "41:33", "red foxes the Coyotes will kill them but", "41:35", "they generally don't eat them what doing", "41:36", "when you started thinking ecologically", "41:37", "it makes sense right like they're so", "41:39", "related that there's lots of diseases", "41:41", "that could be transmitted between them", "41:42", "so it's kind of a risk anytime you eat", "41:45", "something that's very closely related to", "41:47", "you oh that's fascinating so essentially", "41:49", "the same thing as like a mad cow disease", "41:51", "exactly which is comes from the prions", "41:54", "which is we feed cows cow material and", "41:57", "then they get that what does it call", "41:59", "jacob's crux felled disease that's right", "42:01", "yeah which is the same disease that they", "42:04", "find in cannibals in where is it what", "42:10", "country is it", "42:11", "find that in Indonesia mm-hmm I forget", "42:16", "where it is but that's interesting", "42:19", "that's essentially the same thing saying", "42:21", "yeah yeah I mean anytime you start and", "42:23", "that's just one disease I mean there's", "42:25", "lots of parasites and stuff too that if", "42:26", "you were a transfer between similarly", "42:30", "related species much easier than it does", "42:32", "to say between a cat and a dog Wow", "42:35", "so I mean there's a lot of spillover and", "42:37", "zoonotic diseases between wildlife and", "42:40", "domestic animals luckily we have lots of", "42:42", "vaccinations for things I'm sure you've", "42:44", "heard of like parvo and distemper yeah", "42:46", "and so there's there's vaccinations we", "42:49", "can give our animals to take care of", "42:50", "that obviously these wild animals just", "42:51", "have to deal with it", "42:52", "yeah distemper is very common right I", "42:54", "had a dog part always click down yeah", "42:56", "but in parvo it's also deadly to puppies", "42:59", "right they get that exactly a parvo is", "43:01", "very common in seria we actually not", "43:04", "just right down the street here we lost", "43:05", "some pups to parvo and is this something", "43:09", "that's transmitted through wildlife as", "43:10", "well it can be so we're not exactly sure", "43:14", "if it's only wildlife to domestic it's", "43:17", "probably both it's probably being moved", "43:18", "between the different populations so I", "43:21", "mean luckily if we vaccinate well we can", "43:23", "reduce that spread but people have to be", "43:26", "good about vaccinating their animals so", "43:28", "do you guys have a mandate like when it", "43:30", "comes to studying coyote when it comes", "43:33", "to dealing with them like what is the", "43:35", "overall emphasis on is it on just", "43:37", "understanding their range where they are", "43:39", "or is it do you try to do something with", "43:42", "them so our role is to try to help", "43:44", "protect wildlife within national park", "43:47", "areas and so what we try to do is we try", "43:50", "to get as most understanding we can so", "43:52", "we can help reduce conflicts help reduce", "43:55", "disease transmissions help just", "43:56", "basically help the whole ecology of", "43:58", "these animals to make sure there's not", "44:00", "things coming into our populations that", "44:03", "are are going to end up affecting them", "44:05", "it's interesting because you know think", "44:07", "like when people start cutting budgets", "44:10", "and they start looking for like wow", "44:13", "where can we reduce spending like there", "44:16", "might be a few people to come along go", "44:17", "ahead why do we give a shit about these", "44:18", "coyotes you know does that does that", "44:20", "come up I mean that always comes up", "44:22", "anytime budgets are dealt with", "44:25", "but for us for an important thing for us", "44:28", "is just make sure that we do everything", "44:29", "we can to protect our resources within", "44:31", "our park and so we we've identified that", "44:35", "this is a potential risk for our local", "44:37", "wildlife and so that's why we've started", "44:39", "studying the things like the mountain", "44:40", "lions the Bobcats so our park is", "44:42", "completely surrounded by urbanization we", "44:44", "have lots of influences I mean our", "44:47", "mountains are about 50% of it is", "44:49", "privately owned and so there's a lot of", "44:51", "chances for development so it's", "44:52", "important for us to understand how", "44:54", "development is affecting the wildlife so", "44:57", "we can help try to mitigate that in the", "44:58", "future that's awesome now when you're", "45:01", "dealing with these animals and you're", "45:04", "collecting data and information do you", "45:07", "guys share it with people that maybe", "45:09", "other peers that you have that work in", "45:12", "much larger areas and do you find like", "45:14", "similar patterns and similar similar", "45:15", "results so we generally shared through", "45:17", "scientific publications is usually how", "45:19", "stuff is shared kind of between us that", "45:21", "being said we definitely talk to other", "45:23", "parks like you simha t I just recently", "45:24", "went there to help them do some raccoon", "45:26", "stuff and so we will definitely share", "45:28", "information to try to help deal with", "45:29", "similar issues and it so I was up there", "45:32", "for about 3 or 4 days and we talked", "45:35", "about lots of different things one", "45:36", "things they've had with coyotes is", "45:37", "people feeding them out of the cars like", "45:39", "people drive through they'll take food", "45:41", "because the Coyotes hanging off nearby", "45:43", "and they'll throw it out the car to the", "45:44", "coyote well Kyle got so habituated to", "45:46", "that it would just be coming up to every", "45:47", "card czar jumping up on cars Lo and so", "45:50", "they're like this is they end up having", "45:52", "to remove the animal because all these", "45:54", "people just end up feeding it they would", "45:55", "go up and scare the thing and they would", "45:58", "I think they even tried I think they", "45:59", "said they tried to paintball it but it", "46:03", "ended up learning who they were like", "46:05", "they learned their cars learned who they", "46:07", "were so every time they would come up", "46:08", "the kite would disappear back into the", "46:09", "bushes even if they tried it in their", "46:11", "own cars but see them in their own cars", "46:14", "the Keio Trek ignite I'm it ended up", "46:17", "learning to recognize the people they're", "46:18", "too small they are wow that's so", "46:21", "interesting", "46:22", "yeah and I definitely noticed that even", "46:24", "like with trapping and stuff when we're", "46:25", "trying to capture these animals I feel", "46:27", "like there's times when they definitely", "46:28", "kind of avoid the area because some of", "46:30", "these animals have been on the air for", "46:31", "years and so we we try to capture them", "46:33", "as many times as we can to keep them on", "46:35", "there so our callers only generally last", "46:36", "somewhere between a year and three years", "46:38", "depending what kind of color we put on", "46:39", "them it's a lot of times we want to keep", "46:41", "them on long terms that we actually", "46:42", "understand the whole lifecycle what's", "46:44", "going on and so we'll go in and try to", "46:46", "capture them again but they're they're", "46:48", "smart they kind of learn to avoid once I", "46:50", "start going into an area well according", "46:52", "to Dan flora is a big part of their", "46:54", "cleverness and also their adaptability", "46:56", "comes from them being preyed upon by", "46:59", "gray wolves and their relationship with", "47:01", "gray wolves that gray wolves had left", "47:03", "and then come back to North America and", "47:05", "in the meantime coyotes had kind of", "47:07", "thrived and when they came back there", "47:09", "was a period of thousands of years of", "47:11", "them being preyed upon by these gray", "47:13", "wolves", "47:13", "so they've adapted all these different", "47:16", "sort of mechanisms in order to stay", "47:17", "alive and to avoid predation and one of", "47:21", "them being that they expand their range", "47:23", "so as we've tried to kill them one of", "47:26", "the things that Dan was saying is that", "47:28", "when they do that roll call thing if", "47:29", "someone's missing the female will", "47:31", "actually have larger litters and then", "47:34", "they'll expand the range so when you", "47:36", "shoot one you think like well keeping", "47:38", "the coyote population down now you", "47:39", "probably raised it up by like 10 15", "47:42", "percent and you expanded their range by", "47:44", "a few miles yeah I don't know if it's", "47:46", "just based off the calling I've heard", "47:48", "that before and there's some dispute", "47:50", "about whether that's the full case or", "47:52", "not but definitely because there's lower", "47:53", "numbers there's definitely more food", "47:55", "resources available and so it makes", "47:57", "sense that they would read then", "47:58", "reproduce more because we definitely", "47:59", "know if food resources go up coyotes can", "48:01", "increase their numbers so oh that's", "48:03", "interesting because he was saying that", "48:04", "it's a direct result of them being", "48:06", "preyed upon you think that's probably in", "48:07", "dispute well the preyed upon I mean I", "48:10", "know the shot or killed or you know", "48:12", "removed I mean truthfully doesn't matter", "48:15", "how the animals how the population", "48:16", "decreases and in fact is that it's down", "48:19", "so then prey numbers go up and so then", "48:22", "there's more prey and so then they", "48:24", "reproduce more because Dan was implying", "48:26", "there's a direct correlation between", "48:27", "there's a physiological event that", "48:30", "happens inside the female that when the", "48:32", "the population grows smaller their", "48:35", "litters grow larger in response to the", "48:37", "population being smaller not necessarily", "48:39", "in response to the increase of food", "48:41", "supply as far as I know the only things", "48:44", "I've read it's usually they've", "48:45", "associated somehow with food supply mmm", "48:47", "so it's probably maybe a combination of", "48:49", "those factors it very well could", "48:51", "I mean it's complicated right these", "48:52", "novels are crazy with what they can do", "48:55", "it's it is absolutely fascinating how", "48:58", "adaptable they are though is there", "48:59", "anything like them I mean you start", "49:02", "thinking things like crows they can be", "49:04", "pretty adaptable to they can live in a", "49:06", "wide variety of areas but they mail it", "49:08", "through 3d space they move down the air", "49:10", "that's a different sort of bargain yeah", "49:12", "no I mean the Coyotes they definitely", "49:14", "there's not any other species been able", "49:15", "to move around the country like they", "49:18", "have they're able to live in the most", "49:20", "urban environments we can imagine I mean", "49:22", "places that people generally think it", "49:23", "may be a raccoon be able to live I know", "49:25", "in Chicago they've gone into areas where", "49:27", "they have coyotes living and they did", "49:29", "not have raccoons living in those same", "49:30", "locations or if there were they were", "49:32", "records were very rare and yet the", "49:34", "coyote seen a bill to persist which is", "49:36", "amazing for an animal that size it just", "49:38", "shows how intelligent they are to be", "49:39", "able to move around us and be able to", "49:41", "take advantage of us is it because they", "49:43", "run faster they're just it's probably a", "49:45", "combination of things they learned how", "49:46", "to deal with roads I mean anytime you", "49:48", "get these urban environments right like", "49:49", "one thing I always like to say it's like", "49:51", "the Westlake neighborhood it's one of", "49:52", "the most dangerous neighborhoods for", "49:54", "pedestrians", "49:55", "yet this coyotes running this", "49:56", "neighborhood all the time and it didn't", "49:59", "have any signs of ever being struck by a", "50:00", "car do you think the smartest coyote is", "50:02", "smarter than the dumbest person yeah", "50:05", "whoa that's deep", "50:10", "yeah it is deep yeah I mean they live a", "50:13", "place about I don't know if I could live", "50:14", "there Wow Wow", "50:17", "now what city has is there any city in", "50:19", "the country that actually has a", "50:20", "legitimate problem with coyote", "50:22", "Penza you talk to I mean la we", "50:25", "definitely have our issues right I mean", "50:26", "there's been bites there's been other", "50:28", "situations I spoke on bitten yeah yeah", "50:31", "Legion Park had some bites there's been", "50:33", "bites down in Orange County so mine had", "50:35", "some bites are they biting homeless", "50:37", "people or they biting people to take", "50:38", "naps what are the it's over the board", "50:41", "usually it seems to be tied to people", "50:42", "been feeding it and so it's almost", "50:44", "coming up and biting like people on the", "50:45", "hands or people on the leg I don't think", "50:48", "any of them know the ones I've heard", "50:50", "have been like where they're trying to", "50:51", "take the person down real type thing", "50:53", "they've all been more like where they're", "50:55", "coming up and one of them like none I", "50:57", "didn't have yes you heard about that", "50:58", "woman who's a folk singer in Canada that", "51:00", "got killed a couple years back by", "51:02", "coyotes yeah I actually went up there", "51:04", "a couple years after that they actually", "51:06", "got a study going on coyotes up there", "51:07", "they radio collared a bunch and I went", "51:09", "up there and helped him capture the", "51:10", "first couple animals to kind of see", "51:12", "what's going on and that's just a crazy", "51:13", "scenario out there it's way different", "51:15", "than what we see down here the coyotes", "51:17", "first are their eastern coyote so", "51:18", "they're a little bit bigger but they're", "51:20", "also they've kind of there's very few", "51:22", "food sources up there they're dealing", "51:24", "with snowshoe hares which their cycles", "51:26", "kind of fluctuate up and down and so", "51:28", "sometimes there could be tons of food", "51:29", "and other times there could be almost", "51:30", "none but they've learned that they can", "51:32", "take advantage of moose during the", "51:33", "winter and they're actually killing", "51:35", "moose in the snow what'd you think of", "51:37", "this little for teh pound animal take it", "51:40", "on this huge moose but they're seeing it", "51:42", "they do these snow surveys and they're", "51:44", "finding these dead moose that were very", "51:46", "clearly killed by coyotes Wow", "51:48", "so a full-grown moose yeah that's insane", "51:51", "now a full-grown moose is like more than", "51:53", "a thousand pounds yeah yeah I know it's", "51:56", "amazing", "51:56", "I mean obviously these moose in the", "51:58", "winter the snow gets deep so they're", "52:00", "they're definitely they can get stuck in", "52:03", "things and that type of scenario how do", "52:04", "they know that it's coyote killed him in", "52:06", "our wolves there's no wolves there wow", "52:09", "that's crazy yeah I did not know that a", "52:13", "coyote kill a fucking moose yeah well", "52:15", "and they had them radio collared so they", "52:17", "were able to see the Coyotes at the", "52:18", "carcasses and stuff - Wow so when they", "52:21", "have the radio collar how much the", "52:22", "information are they getting do they get", "52:24", "like a full like if you could see a map", "52:26", "would you see like the trail like", "52:28", "everywhere they go it depends so the", "52:31", "caller's have different settings so", "52:32", "their GPS units so you're there's always", "52:34", "a trade-off between battery life and the", "52:36", "number of locations you can get so you", "52:39", "could if you only cared about a two-week", "52:41", "span you could have that GPS unit take a", "52:43", "location every 30 seconds and you could", "52:47", "map it out but generally we're", "52:49", "interested in a broader timeframe so a", "52:51", "lot of times we're getting so like the", "52:52", "Lions a lot of times it's about eight", "52:54", "locations a day and that's a pretty good", "52:55", "size caller on the coyotes I usually do", "52:57", "somewhere around six and then I'll do", "53:01", "these little bouts where I'll do 20 min", "53:03", "of occasions a day and so then I'll get", "53:04", "more intensity and then I can map out", "53:06", "like where they come up to roads or", "53:08", "where they do different things where", "53:10", "they're feeding so yeah you can get some", "53:12", "pretty detailed data on how they're", "53:14", "moving so what kind of a battery source", "53:16", "are you using on these", "53:17", "collars that you can get such a long", "53:19", "like how long does a like if you stretch", "53:21", "it out the longest how long can they", "53:23", "last so there's different sizes of", "53:25", "collars and so like the lion collars are", "53:27", "they can be 2 D cell batteries in them", "53:30", "which are just lithium cell batteries", "53:32", "and those go about two years with a 2 D", "53:34", "cell battery Wow", "53:36", "you can put them on tiny little things I", "53:38", "mean people done not with GPS yet I", "53:41", "don't believe but they've even done like", "53:42", "little bugs where they've put the so the", "53:44", "caller's have two different things they", "53:45", "have a GPS and they have a VHF function", "53:47", "the VHF allows us to actually go out and", "53:48", "track the animals so when you see", "53:49", "biologists out there with those antennas", "53:51", "so you literally know where they are", "53:53", "they are yeah so that's how like lot of", "53:55", "these observations I've talked about", "53:56", "that's how I see them is because they", "53:58", "have that little beacon that goes off", "53:59", "and a collar and so I can track them", "54:00", "with that antenna and see where they are", "54:02", "and get pretty close to them and see", "54:04", "them what they're doing that's", "54:05", "incredible so they literally the last", "54:07", "two years with two D cell batteries yeah", "54:09", "and then when the two years are up you", "54:11", "don't know where he is", "54:12", "exactly well what's amazing about the", "54:14", "Lions is that we can recapture them we", "54:16", "have really good success we're getting", "54:18", "those guys back and so Jeff's been", "54:19", "amazing and he's been able to get these", "54:21", "animals time after time after time and", "54:23", "that's why I like the p22 has been", "54:25", "captured so many times we have to", "54:25", "replace the collar right so it's usually", "54:28", "about every two years but to replace the", "54:29", "collar so God so how are they tracking", "54:31", "that cat um I mean there we've done", "54:36", "multiple things we got lucky one time", "54:38", "and he was actually down in a hole and", "54:39", "me and Jeff were actually there and we", "54:41", "darted the thing and it just fell asleep", "54:43", "in the hole which was pretty sweet so", "54:45", "you saw in a hole like a hole in the", "54:47", "ground it was kind of a drainage channel", "54:50", "was kind of eroded away and he was kind", "54:52", "of down in this and there's a bunch of", "54:54", "brush covering it and so he felt pretty", "54:55", "comfortable I guess and he just stayed", "54:57", "there and so we were hiking and I don't", "55:01", "know if we were looking for a kill or if", "55:03", "we were just checking on my camera or", "55:04", "what we were doing but whatever we saw", "55:06", "him and so we're like well let's tried", "55:08", "to dart him and so I stood there and", "55:10", "waited for Jeff to go get the stuff and", "55:11", "Jeff was able to dart him when he came", "55:13", "back and the cat just laid there like we", "55:15", "put a dart in him he growled at us he", "55:17", "laid back down and fell asleep and we", "55:19", "were able to process him how creepy is", "55:21", "when a cat growls yeah I was actually", "55:23", "pretty freaking cool like I've it's", "55:27", "pretty amazing be not close to such a", "55:28", "big animal", "55:30", "how far away were you uh probably from", "55:32", "me to your wall oh no really yeah", "55:35", "oh my god so pretty like God you have a", "55:38", "backup gun or a Taser or we carry", "55:41", "Paterson America shield Kevin I'm so", "55:44", "nice yeah I'm out there mr. Harris yo", "55:47", "come on I got you I would think that", "55:49", "would actually be a good move for a cab", "55:51", "right like a big old like gladiator", "55:54", "shield I probably confused they try to", "55:58", "Jack you bang they run into the shield", "55:59", "where is he nice yeah I don't think I", "56:02", "want carried out through the brush", "56:02", "though that's a good point", "56:04", "um no we we do carry bear spray does", "56:07", "that work I mean we haven't had to use", "56:09", "it so yeah yeah use it once and tell me", "56:12", "because I was thinking like I run", "56:14", "through the hills I was thinking you", "56:15", "know I did it was an area where I run", "56:18", "where it's really desolate there's no", "56:19", "one out there and I know this Bobcats", "56:21", "there but I also now know that there's a", "56:24", "mountain line there cuz a buddy of mine", "56:26", "saw a mountain line there and had a", "56:29", "caller and then he heard about a", "56:32", "mountain line that got killed on the", "56:34", "five freeway and he checked a website is", "56:38", "there website that shows you the track", "56:40", "like where where the animals been um", "56:43", "there are that we can see we don't share", "56:45", "that with other people", "56:46", "I wonder how he found out he knows a lot", "56:49", "of people maybe ask somebody but but", "56:51", "found out that it was the was the", "56:53", "mountain line that he saw in his", "56:55", "neighborhood and he lives pretty close", "56:56", "to the five okay and so he was a", "56:59", "explaining that you know like he saw it", "57:01", "yeah I mean we don't have any cats that", "57:02", "are up there near the five so probably", "57:05", "he coulda probably looked at that map", "57:06", "that you guys put up there even it could", "57:07", "have easily been one of those kings", "57:09", "because there's just not many up in that", "57:10", "area that we have collared but they do", "57:12", "occasionally get hit by cars right yeah", "57:14", "that's actually one of our biggest", "57:15", "causes mortality these days is them", "57:17", "getting hit by cars so we really we work", "57:19", "a lot with Caltrans to try to improve", "57:21", "permeability of the roadways for a", "57:23", "wildlife and protect them from being hit", "57:24", "by cars I know there was a ramp that was", "57:27", "being proposed that they were going to", "57:29", "put a ramp over the highway right oh", "57:31", "here it is yeah Caltrans proposes", "57:33", "wildlife overpass on the 101 freeway now", "57:35", "where were they kind of try to put that", "57:37", "so this is supposed to be near Liberty", "57:38", "Canyon this is where's Liberty Canyon", "57:40", "it's just a little bit west", "57:43", "here near gora okay yeah so this this", "57:49", "overpass will be big from outlines but", "57:50", "also lots of other wildlife in our", "57:52", "mountains hmm", "57:53", "so we have seen that the 101 freeway is", "57:56", "a major barrier to gene flow and so", "57:58", "things like even coyotes even though", "58:00", "they were able to live in this super", "58:01", "urban environment that 101 and the", "58:03", "development along 101 is serving as a", "58:05", "barrier that they're not getting across", "58:06", "regularly enough to keep the population", "58:09", "genetics up so genetic diversity sound", "58:12", "of the freeway is a lot lower than", "58:13", "genetic diversity north of the freeway", "58:15", "right right now I asked for Bobcats", "58:18", "mountain lions and coyotes yeah I have a", "58:20", "friend who works at the Tejon ranch do", "58:23", "you know where that is", "58:23", "yeah I have a buddy that works there too", "58:24", "oh do you yeah I was actually just there", "58:26", "this weekend and they were explaining to", "58:27", "me that they had a camera trap on one of", "58:30", "the water holes and they saw 16", "58:32", "different mountain lions Wow", "58:35", "they've got 16 photos of 16 different", "58:37", "cats that are on there a huge ranch", "58:39", "270,000 acres its enormous ranch yeah", "58:42", "yeah I I don't know how they could", "58:44", "identify each individual lion that's my", "58:46", "first question yeah how does they know", "58:47", "individual but yeah I'm not Lions they", "58:51", "can be quite a few of them I mean a lot", "58:52", "of times in my own lines will come back", "58:53", "obviously with especially with the thing", "58:54", "like a water source there right so I", "58:57", "would I would question whether it was", "58:58", "different or not but yeah I mean the", "59:00", "place like the hoenn I mean it's amazing", "59:02", "right there's lots of different prey", "59:03", "animals there oh yeah from Elk - dear -", "59:06", "that's a special place it is it's really", "59:09", "crazy you know just I mean everything", "59:11", "the wildlife the flowers the the pigs", "59:14", "like it's just a crazy crazy place", "59:17", "it is only pigs there it's it's a nutty", "59:19", "farm I mean a nutty ranch but it's so", "59:22", "large it's just amazing like my buddy's", "59:24", "like a cowboy up there and so he took me", "59:26", "for a tour to kind of see the ranch and", "59:27", "it's amazing yeah well it's the biggest", "59:29", "ranch in California yeah 270,000 acres", "59:33", "is almost hard to like wrap your head", "59:35", "around how big it is but when you're", "59:36", "there and you go how far does it go and", "59:38", "they go see that third mountain range we", "59:40", "go to that", "59:41", "what yeah over to the desert over yeah", "59:44", "yeah it's everywhere and then the water", "59:46", "for Los Angeles goes through it if you", "59:48", "see that gigantic water pipe that goes", "59:50", "through the knee right branch yeah yeah", "59:53", "and you know what that's where all the", "59:54", "water goes it goes through this thing", "59:56", "it's just it's just crazy it's amazing", "59:59", "yeah", "59:59", "well it's weird that we have a place", "60:02", "that's an hour and a half outside of LA", "60:04", "that has elk now and that's like yeah", "60:07", "we're so lucky like it's such a unique", "60:09", "spot you know a lot of ways that's", "60:11", "amazing I mean used to be tons of elk", "60:13", "here right like all the tule elk they", "60:15", "used to cover the whole area yeah", "60:17", "worries of tule elk out in the San", "60:19", "Joaquin Valley there's just amazing", "60:21", "numbers of elk so yeah well also grizzly", "60:24", "bears and Grizzlies yeah that's there's", "60:27", "a there's a town up near Tejon that's", "60:30", "named after the last guy that got killed", "60:33", "by a grizzly bear in California but", "60:35", "before they wiped him out god I'm trying", "60:38", "to remember I'm trying to remember the", "60:40", "town's name hmm damn it", "60:43", "but the it's been confirmed that he was", "60:46", "killed they actually exhumed his body", "60:48", "and found it you know broken up into", "60:50", "pieces and one of his legs was chewed", "60:52", "off like it was wow like you really did", "60:55", "get jacked by a grizzly apparently we", "60:56", "had enormous coastal bears and that's", "60:59", "why they wiped them out it's just like", "61:01", "when the settlers came here they were", "61:02", "like okay fuck this we gotta kill these", "61:04", "goddamn things because they were like", "61:06", "you know Kodiak sized enormous bears but", "61:09", "obviously they did a good job since we", "61:11", "don't have a single grizzly left in", "61:12", "California yeah that's one animal Lebec", "61:14", "thank you jack okay Beck that's that's", "61:16", "one animal where people are not", "61:18", "clamoring for a reintroduction yeah you", "61:21", "know like well it's really there's no", "61:22", "area left for them yeah like the area", "61:24", "that Grizzlies occurred we've developed", "61:26", "turned in agriculture urbanization so", "61:28", "bringing Grizzlies back I mean you hear", "61:30", "it every once while somebody say that", "61:32", "but I'm like they're too big and they", "61:35", "need too much food yeah and too much of", "61:37", "that food is living animals and that", "61:40", "would be a problem yeah well even if", "61:42", "that's I mean even all that if there's", "61:44", "no habitat where do I put them like", "61:45", "they're sure they're not going to live", "61:46", "up in the high mountains that's what we", "61:48", "have see as we have protected the", "61:50", "Sierras and those type I'm not grizzly", "61:52", "Tabet at so well we do have quite a bit", "61:54", "of black bears", "61:55", "we do but they can live up in the", "61:56", "mountain yeah they do much better in", "61:58", "that scenario", "61:58", "yeah it's really fascinating to me how", "62:01", "the whole thing is sort of like a", "62:04", "balanced system and they all sort of", "62:07", "keep each other in check", "62:09", "you know California's a good example of", "62:11", "that because it's one of the few states", "62:12", "that that has a large healthy mountain", "62:15", "lion population but they don't allow", "62:17", "hunting of mountain lions so because of", "62:20", "that you have less deer but and people", "62:22", "will complain about that hunters but", "62:24", "also because they you have less car", "62:25", "accidents with deer yeah like if you", "62:27", "live in like I have a buddy lives in", "62:29", "Iowa you have to drive slow because the", "62:31", "fucking deer just jumping out in front", "62:33", "of the road every 50 100 yards means", "62:35", "crazy how many especially during the rut", "62:37", "when they're breeding and they get silly", "62:39", "see just dead deer every couple miles", "62:42", "see a dead deer on the side of the road", "62:44", "yeah I mean we're a lot different", "62:45", "obviously than the Midwest like you're", "62:47", "talking about - we got a lot less", "62:48", "vegetation or a lot less rain so we have", "62:50", "a lot less of that good quality", "62:51", "vegetation for the deer so our deer", "62:53", "numbers are also going to be in check", "62:54", "partially just because we don't have the", "62:56", "the highest quality habitat for deer in", "62:59", "most of our areas is what like what", "63:01", "they're just eating grass and stuff", "63:02", "right like what are they eating they'd a", "63:03", "lot of brows a lot of brush sage right a", "63:05", "lot of sage they can definitely sage", "63:07", "there's a lot of like deer brush and", "63:10", "just lots of variety of type of broaden", "63:12", "and you walk through there there's tons", "63:13", "of different varieties that they eat we", "63:15", "actually have a couple deer radio collar", "63:17", "right now that we're following in there", "63:18", "they're always browsing on something", "63:20", "when I see them usually something taller", "63:22", "and how do you capture them we dart them", "63:24", "so you do you set like you trap them and", "63:28", "then dart them I tell y'all we freed", "63:30", "ardham okay so how do you do that you", "63:32", "basically just try to find where they're", "63:35", "Adam he's basically hunting basically", "63:37", "hunting with a dart rifle so it's a lot", "63:38", "like archery basically I mean you rain", "63:41", "just be like really short right yeah", "63:43", "so somebody really go at the dart rifle", "63:45", "and probably get up to 70 meters or so", "63:47", "really I'm not that person I'm about 30", "63:50", "meters with mine how many deer have you", "63:52", "darted I've only darted two here but", "63:54", "we're hoping we still have four more we", "63:56", "need to do so is it an air rifle uh so", "63:59", "there's two different types there's one", "64:00", "that's basically powered off a seat a 22", "64:02", "shell then there's another one that's", "64:05", "powered off co2 hmm and so do you", "64:09", "just with this thing how do you get good", "64:10", "at it yeah you practice I mean it's like", "64:12", "a rifle you got a scope and all that so", "64:13", "you can count you get it all sighted in", "64:15", "but the ballistics must be terrible how", "64:17", "they're bad and it's even more", "64:19", "complicated because you want it to arch", "64:21", "really lightly you want to advance soft", "64:22", "as possible cuz if you hit them hard", "64:24", "they're gonna run right and the drug", "64:26", "it's not like the drug takes them down", "64:27", "immediately we usually have about ten", "64:28", "minutes for the animal to go down and oh", "64:30", "Jesus she'll never find them exactly so", "64:32", "it's really about like arching that shot", "64:35", "in there really softly hit them as soft", "64:36", "as possible and then a lot of times they", "64:38", "don't go very far Wow so like what's the", "64:41", "feet-per-second of the dart oh I don't", "64:44", "know we I haven't we don't have the", "64:45", "Koenig refer you don't have a radar", "64:47", "thing that you shoot it through we don't", "64:49", "want to borrow mine sure okay well I'm", "64:51", "gonna tee I want to know yeah I think", "64:53", "that's interesting like what like", "64:54", "because you must have like a but the", "64:57", "drop must be huge it is like how do you", "64:59", "sight in a scope for something for", "65:02", "people to know what we're talking about", "65:03", "I give you shoot a rifle rifle a bullet", "65:05", "goes very fast so you could shoot out to", "65:08", "100 yards and it essentially is going to", "65:10", "go exactly where you're aiming at but", "65:12", "then when you go to 200 yards it gets a", "65:14", "little tricky and you have to adjust", "65:16", "your scope because it'll drop a little", "65:17", "bit you get to 300 yards it'll drop a", "65:19", "little bit more 400 yards and out is", "65:21", "where it gets really weird like you're", "65:24", "dealing with wind drift you're dealing", "65:26", "with drop so I would imagine that a dart", "65:29", "is not going very fast so it probably", "65:32", "drops quite a bit it does and it's heavy", "65:34", "they're fairly long there how many", "65:36", "grains is half inches I don't know how", "65:39", "many grains they are they don't come", "65:41", "those measurements and I've never", "65:42", "weighed one so I'm not positive but", "65:44", "obviously because they are going so slow", "65:47", "they're doing with wind drift at yeah", "65:49", "five metres then it can start doing it", "65:51", "so if you're not aerodynamic either", "65:53", "right it's not horrible I mean it", "65:55", "basically looks like a syringe yeah with", "65:57", "the needle on the end then we have some", "65:59", "feathers on the end oh so you have like", "66:01", "fletchings to make sure you I wouldn't", "66:03", "call it fletchings it's that's what it", "66:04", "looks like yeah exactly like that 20 ml", "66:08", "air for 10 point o ml dar was that mean", "66:11", "so that's a you can put 20 milliliters", "66:15", "of air for the 10 the dark that's the", "66:18", "holds 10 milliliters of drug oh I see so", "66:20", "that's that's not the exact drug", "66:22", "we use we use one called I believe it's", "66:24", "nude art no that's a little different it", "66:26", "actually has a so ours", "66:27", "least the ones we use for the deer we", "66:29", "use these type as well but for the deer", "66:31", "we use ones that have a little charge in", "66:33", "them so when it hits it discharges", "66:34", "basically by like a shell would doesn't", "66:37", "look gunpowder in there that trigger", "66:38", "triggers off Jesus Christ Wow", "66:40", "so you have to sneak up on these deer", "66:43", "and then do this yeah so what I was", "66:46", "going to tell you kind of how we adjust", "66:47", "for that distance because it's last", "66:49", "question you're asking so the nice thing", "66:51", "about our rifles versus a regular rifle", "66:53", "so you get one chill and that's what you", "66:55", "go with with us because it's air powered", "66:56", "we can adjust our pressure so to account", "67:00", "for that distance we know at 20 yards we", "67:03", "do two bars of pressure at 30 yards we", "67:06", "do three bars of pressure that one so we", "67:09", "have a little more adjustability than", "67:10", "typical rifle would so you're walking", "67:12", "around with a rangefinder yeah and then", "67:14", "you're changing it on your rifle as you", "67:17", "go along yeah as we make our decision we", "67:20", "because we don't like we don't walk with", "67:22", "it charged we I mean our darts and", "67:24", "they're ready to go but we don't fire I", "67:26", "mean we don't have our our pressure up", "67:29", "until we know what deer we're taking in", "67:30", "the distance and are you just aiming for", "67:33", "center mass and hip hip huh why hip", "67:37", "because that's where the biggest muscle", "67:38", "is oh I say okay so the drugs in act in", "67:42", "intramuscularly", "67:43", "right either so if you accidentally hit", "67:47", "the ribs it's not good um it's not great", "67:50", "no it's it still will probably put them", "67:52", "to sleep the needles aren't long enough", "67:55", "that it should do much damage", "67:57", "so you hit a vital right I mean you know", "67:59", "you can't ever say never but yeah it", "68:01", "shouldn't but it's not gonna kill them", "68:02", "they shouldn't know and that we practice", "68:05", "a lot to make sure we hit where we went", "68:07", "ahead yeah how you practice that you", "68:09", "have a rubber deer that you shoot at we", "68:11", "have archery targets that we shoot at", "68:13", "yeah wow that's interesting and do you", "68:16", "use a regular rifle scope or do you have", "68:18", "like a scope specifically designed for", "68:20", "darts now it's a regular rifle scope no", "68:22", "kidding yeah Wow", "68:24", "so how often are you practicing um", "68:26", "before we do it I practice quite a few", "68:29", "times I go out like I don't practice", "68:30", "daily like you do with the archery right", "68:33", "but I practice pretty regularly when I", "68:35", "write before", "68:35", "I was starting these last two we're kind", "68:37", "of taking a break right now because", "68:38", "they're fawning and so we don't want to", "68:40", "dart them while they're of course", "68:42", "dropping bombs dropping fawns we were I", "68:45", "feel fawns a little bigger that's", "68:47", "interesting move your missed one um I", "68:50", "haven't taken that many shots did I miss", "68:52", "any of my shots how many of you darted", "68:54", "just the two just two yeah and we this", "68:57", "is our first time doing to your stuff so", "68:58", "Fish and Game came out and helped us", "69:00", "with these guys and which was great and", "69:02", "you have to dart to Moore's that we just", "69:03", "said four more four more yeah and why", "69:06", "Dix is that just like you just want a", "69:08", "good study number that so we're looking", "69:10", "at roadways and trying to identify", "69:12", "crossing points for I mean we're not", "69:14", "just doing deer we're doing other", "69:15", "species as well but we're trying to", "69:17", "identify where we can make improvements", "69:19", "things like that wildlife overpass in", "69:21", "other areas so that's why we're doing", "69:24", "that and so we're just trying to get a", "69:25", "sample size that we can kind of work", "69:27", "with and the colors aren't cheap so it's", "69:29", "it's about resources and what we have", "69:30", "that runs towards the project and what", "69:33", "and what are you trying to gather like", "69:35", "what would it would data so it's all", "69:37", "movement based data so they these are", "69:39", "GPS collars they transmit us can be", "69:43", "anywhere from I think the caller sixty", "69:45", "points a day down to I think Milo is", "69:47", "eight points a day and so it'll tell me", "69:49", "it'll give me an idea of where the deer", "69:51", "are approaching the roadways and how", "69:53", "they're moving relative to the roadways", "69:55", "so we can help come up with mitigation", "69:56", "to improve their ability to get across", "69:58", "okay so it's all about their migration", "70:01", "and where they're moving around and", "70:03", "keeping them away from danger yeah I", "70:05", "mean I wouldn't quite call it migration", "70:06", "but close enough yes idea is just to", "70:08", "help them be able to get across now are", "70:10", "they Columbia Blacktail these are not", "70:13", "these are mule deer and our mule deer", "70:15", "yeah no kidding yeah and now they", "70:17", "they're like a pure meat mule deer I", "70:19", "believe so hmm yeah the black tail start", "70:22", "a little bit north of us I don't", "70:23", "remember exactly where the cutoff line", "70:25", "is but so like right around here like in", "70:27", "the hills like Encino and stuff like", "70:29", "that those are mule deer those are our", "70:30", "mule deer wow that's interesting yeah", "70:32", "yeah I always thought that too cuz I", "70:34", "hunted for years and I always thought", "70:37", "blocked hill but no once I got here and", "70:38", "started working with them was like all", "70:40", "these are all mule deer now how do they", "70:41", "make the differentiation how they", "70:43", "understand that there are some just", "70:44", "physical characteristic differences and", "70:45", "I think there's been some genetic work", "70:47", "done as well because it", "70:49", "only when you think of mule deer you", "70:51", "think of a large deer with a big rack", "70:53", "like mule deer have enormous racks yeah", "70:56", "like that deer right there that's a mule", "70:58", "deer yeah like if you saw one of those", "70:59", "around here you'd be like holy shit you", "71:03", "never see a deer that big around here no", "71:05", "I mean there's some decent deer in these", "71:07", "mountains but yeah it's I mean but mule", "71:08", "not all mule deer that big there's lots", "71:10", "where there's mule deer that are still", "71:12", "quite small and that's just what we're", "71:13", "doing with here is the smaller and you", "71:15", "think it's because of the the Predators", "71:17", "like they never really get a chance to", "71:18", "get that bag because there's the", "71:19", "populations are pretty small or is a", "71:21", "genetic issue we think it's a genetic", "71:23", "issue I mean they're this populations", "71:27", "been kind of isolated for a long time", "71:29", "from others but California generally is", "71:30", "not thought of to have monster bucks", "71:32", "even though there's plenty of mule deer", "71:34", "in this state right so it's more just a", "71:36", "factor of what's here and so north of us", "71:39", "is where the Blacktail are yeah and why", "71:41", "like where'd that what does that range", "71:43", "begin I wish I could I'm not sure up top", "71:45", "my head I wish I'm sorry in a breeding", "71:47", "correct I'm sure there is yeah and", "71:49", "they're viable or the hybrids", "71:51", "I would assume they're viable but I'm", "71:52", "not positive hmm yeah I'm not I'm", "71:55", "definitely not fully up on all the deer", "71:56", "literature so what other animals are you", "71:59", "guys concerned with like they're theirs", "72:01", "their safety and populations so I mean", "72:04", "we're worried about the whole community", "72:05", "I mean we knew things with frogs", "72:07", "salamanders we do surveys for snakes we", "72:12", "actually have a red-legged frog", "72:12", "reintroduction right now reintroduction", "72:15", "yeah so there's people complaining not", "72:17", "enough red legged frogs well there used", "72:19", "to be here and we had a well we don't", "72:21", "really know why they disappeared but", "72:23", "they disappeared thirty years ago or so", "72:24", "and they were left in one little pool in", "72:28", "one place and so we're just trying to", "72:30", "help them get reestablished do don't let", "72:31", "Donald Trump fun about this so cut", "72:33", "funding right like a frog what we need", "72:36", "that money to go to bankers I mean it", "72:39", "seems it's it's fascinating to me that", "72:41", "we do have these programs to like help", "72:43", "out like a frog hmm yeah I mean it's all", "72:46", "severable man-hours right uh it takes", "72:48", "some but it's not huge amounts mates one", "72:50", "person going out and doing these", "72:52", "projects and it's not like that's their", "72:54", "only job they have lots of different", "72:55", "things they do right so it's just one", "72:57", "small part of their job so they just", "72:58", "bring like a bucket of frogs and throw", "73:00", "them into the bushes it's not like guys", "73:02", "yeah", "73:03", "quite that simple they have to move egg", "73:04", "masses basically it's what they do they", "73:06", "do yeah oh so that when they move the", "73:08", "egg masses do they move the mom as well", "73:10", "and or the the the frogs just develop", "73:13", "independently in the new area", "73:14", "yeah they develop independent ooh that", "73:16", "in their own area the mom doesn't care", "73:18", "for their frogs or any of that bitches", "73:21", "so when they do that when they when you", "73:24", "drop off these egg masses in this place", "73:26", "so this frog will be born or hatched in", "73:30", "this area rather and they just assume", "73:32", "this is where they live yep that's", "73:34", "interesting so if you took a fully", "73:36", "developed frog and put it there probably", "73:37", "wouldn't know what to do with the area", "73:38", "because it would be a new area for it", "73:40", "it'd be like why am I here yeah this", "73:42", "isn't my project either so I'm not a", "73:44", "hundred percent on it but from my", "73:46", "understanding is that they will try to", "73:48", "move back towards their natal range and", "73:50", "then they don't end up making it so it's", "73:52", "better to do the tadpoles or the eggs", "73:54", "and then they'll hopefully stay there", "73:56", "that's cool so what is the benefit of", "73:58", "having these red legged frogs around", "74:00", "they're just a part of the ecosystem we", "74:02", "think it's a good idea - exactly it's", "74:04", "just trying to protect the overall", "74:05", "ecosystem we don't really understand I", "74:07", "mean we like to think we understand all", "74:09", "this ecology and all that there it's", "74:11", "it's complicated right we don't know", "74:12", "that interaction swing Lobby species so", "74:14", "a lot of its just trying to make sure", "74:15", "that our full suite of species is there", "74:17", "so our ecosystems right healthy as", "74:20", "possible so when you reintroduce the red", "74:23", "frog will there then be subsequent", "74:25", "studies about the impact of the", "74:26", "reintroduction of the red frog redleg", "74:28", "frog and it's hard to know at this point", "74:30", "I mean it's all based off funding like", "74:31", "their Lea there's potential there but", "74:33", "right now we we don't really know all", "74:36", "right let me propose this to you what if", "74:39", "you had an unlimited budget what if I", "74:40", "made Justin Brown king of the world", "74:42", "and I said listen dude you could do", "74:44", "whatever the fuck you want with all this", "74:45", "money and what would you do if you make", "74:47", "any promises here no I wish I could I", "74:49", "wish I could obviously I don't have that", "74:51", "kind of power yeah of course yeah if I", "74:52", "did though if I said listen man I'm", "74:54", "gonna give you an unlimited budget to", "74:56", "take care of this wildlife as you would", "74:57", "see fit what would you like to have done", "74:59", "well one of the first things would be", "75:01", "that wildlife overpass you see for are", "75:02", "released if you're talking about doing", "75:04", "things for what's good for the local", "75:06", "right ology here that would be probably", "75:08", "the highest thing on my priority list", "75:09", "because that is something that's not", "75:11", "just affecting one species it's", "75:12", "affecting everything that's within our", "75:14", "mountain range", "75:15", "which is fairly large under 50,000 acres", "75:17", "that there's just completely being", "75:19", "disconnected from other wildlife mmm so", "75:21", "to me that that's our number one thing", "75:23", "the other thing is so we have lots of", "75:26", "issues with these poisons there I would", "75:28", "try to find alternatives to these", "75:30", "poisons that are being spread throughout", "75:31", "the environment because that's a major", "75:33", "issue for our wildlife yeah that is a", "75:35", "giant issue when you see the mange", "75:37", "that's on that cat and you think that", "75:39", "that all comes somehow another from rat", "75:41", "poison like whatever happen to rat traps", "75:43", "like I will just use a trap and people", "75:45", "don't let's see blood is that what it is", "75:47", "that's my best assumption because people", "75:49", "you try to recommend traps and they just", "75:50", "won't do it there's such a trickle-down", "75:52", "though when you're using those toxins I", "75:54", "know it sets that's frightening to me", "75:56", "because that gets to people in some way", "75:58", "shape or form yeah definitely", "76:00", "yeah that's it's my worry as well it", "76:02", "also leaks into the ground like there's", "76:04", "there's all sorts of weird effects you", "76:06", "can get from poisons yeah and we don't", "76:08", "even understand the facts we put tons of", "76:10", "toxic ins out there that we have no idea", "76:11", "the actual long-term effects or how it's", "76:14", "going to change things I mean like these", "76:16", "rat poisons there's a long time they", "76:17", "said it wouldn't move up the food chain", "76:18", "but we are quite clearly seeing it move", "76:20", "up the food chain to have a mountain", "76:22", "lion die of rat poison is crazy yeah do", "76:25", "they die of it yeah we've had three", "76:27", "mountain lions diaphragm poison Wow and", "76:29", "you believe this from coyotes that's", "76:31", "what we thank yeah so one of them they", "76:33", "went back to a few kills that it made", "76:35", "right before it died and they found that", "76:37", "it killed a couple coyotes uh Wow Wow", "76:40", "and it doesn't kill the Coyotes who", "76:43", "knows the coyote have been really sick", "76:45", "at that point and maybe that's how the", "76:46", "mountain lion got it anyway exactly so", "76:48", "cuz with these poisons a lot of times", "76:50", "these animals don't die for four to ten", "76:53", "days Oh God so they're walking circles I", "76:55", "don't know if you've ever seen like rats", "76:56", "walking circles out of running into", "76:57", "buildings like I've seen a couple times", "76:59", "out walking around that's generally what", "77:01", "they're dying of their diet they're", "77:02", "they're dying of dehydration basically", "77:03", "because they're just bleeding out", "77:04", "internally yeah so well that was", "77:07", "actually in Dan Flores his book is that", "77:09", "they had developed certain types of", "77:11", "coyote poisons that were slow acting so", "77:15", "that they could trick these coyotes into", "77:17", "eating this stuff and the other coyotes", "77:19", "wouldn't know where the Caillou got sick", "77:21", "from because it took so long for them to", "77:22", "die it wasn't like strychnine where you", "77:25", "eat it you watch the other one die and", "77:27", "that's also what rats do did you ever", "77:30", "see that rat documentary on Netflix I", "77:31", "heard you mention if I still haven't", "77:33", "seen it you gotta watch it it's amazing", "77:35", "it freaked me out it's nuts like when", "77:39", "when they show the amount of rats that", "77:41", "are in New York City and they show all", "77:43", "the people dealing with them and they", "77:45", "show them in the sewer system and", "77:46", "everything it's mind-boggling and then", "77:50", "they talk about how the rats will", "77:52", "literally send a young dumb rat over to", "77:55", "the poison and they watch that rat eat", "77:57", "the poison and die and I'm like fuck", "77:58", "this rat here and they all take off like", "78:00", "they've got a whole system for dealing", "78:02", "with poisons yeah well because they did", "78:04", "the same thing with rat poisons my", "78:05", "understanding they they kind of gone", "78:07", "through different more for the poison to", "78:09", "try to make them last a little longer so", "78:11", "that because the rats will do the same", "78:12", "thing the Coyotes doing not to eat it so", "78:15", "that didn't surprise me they saw that", "78:16", "documentary I don't have to watch that", "78:17", "there's no way to mitigate the problem", "78:19", "now I mean though the rat population is", "78:21", "so large in New York City they think", "78:23", "there's many rats as there are people or", "78:25", "more yeah I believe it oh I mean I've", "78:28", "been in little intersections down in LA", "78:31", "at night and just rats", "78:32", "it looks like the grounds moving at", "78:34", "these crazy locations like most places", "78:36", "you see go you don't see that me rats", "78:37", "then also you'll hit this called a honey", "78:39", "hole for frat yeah and they'll just be", "78:42", "like whoa look at what the hell's going", "78:44", "on here I was in New York City way back", "78:46", "in the day it was so long ago there was", "78:48", "payphones and I had to make phone call", "78:51", "and I was getting gas so I pulled up", "78:53", "this gas station", "78:54", "I put the you know pump in I'm filling", "78:57", "up my car and I go over to this pay", "78:59", "phone to make a call at as I mean in the", "79:01", "time it took me to walk from the pump to", "79:04", "the payphone I'm watching rats jump on", "79:07", "to the wheels of my car like they're", "79:10", "jumping on the wheel and crawling up and", "79:12", "down they're like I don't know if", "79:14", "they're looking for food or they're", "79:15", "looking to get in the engine for warmth", "79:17", "or whatever but apparently people have a", "79:19", "real issue with rats getting inside the", "79:22", "hood of their car and like nesting they", "79:25", "like climb in there for the heat and", "79:27", "they stay warm inside the hood of your", "79:30", "car good lord", "79:31", "yeah I mean they're so adaptable but", "79:33", "they instantaneously did I mean I pulled", "79:36", "the car up put the pump in walked turned", "79:38", "around like what the fuck I'm not", "79:40", "talking about like one rat I'm talking", "79:42", "five six seven rats just hopping up but", "79:44", "another one would hop up and one would", "79:46", "hop down it was terrifying because I was", "79:48", "trying to figure okay am I gonna be", "79:50", "driving there's gonna be a rat on the", "79:51", "floor and then I'm gonna hit the gas", "79:53", "instead of the brakes I'm gonna freak", "79:54", "out like a little girl yeah it was", "79:56", "terrifying now that would be creepy", "79:58", "because they're just so adaptable", "80:00", "I mean and it's it's an another", "80:02", "essentially we don't like to think of", "80:04", "them as a wild animal but a rat is a", "80:06", "wild animal that lives in this weird", "80:08", "symbiotic relationship with people in", "80:10", "urban environments yeah I mean it's", "80:12", "amazing there that is the one species", "80:14", "that's probably more adapted to us than", "80:16", "the Coyotes are obviously because they", "80:17", "are able to live in almost everywhere", "80:20", "that we live yeah and there I mean they", "80:23", "serve a purpose and some sort of a weird", "80:24", "way I mean if they were removed I wonder", "80:27", "what the impact would be yeah I mean I'm", "80:30", "sure we probably more nesting birds and", "80:32", "some of that kind of stuff because we", "80:33", "know that rats definitely impact bird", "80:35", "species yeah", "80:36", "and who knows there may not be if there", "80:39", "was wasn't rats weather coyotes or some", "80:41", "of these other small predators would be", "80:42", "around the urban areas because they're", "80:43", "obviously another prey source you know", "80:45", "but trying to get a rats the whole", "80:47", "another ball good luck yeah yeah it's", "80:49", "just that's the one that's probably a", "80:51", "IOT yeah in Nuuk death city you'd have", "80:53", "to get everybody to agree and then", "80:55", "they'd probably move back in within a", "80:57", "couple of years yeah yeah it's you're", "80:59", "not going to do it so this proposed", "81:02", "bridge across the 101", "81:04", "what is is there a roadblocks that is it", "81:05", "a funding issue is there anybody that is", "81:08", "against it Oh as far as we know there's", "81:10", "not anybody really against it there", "81:12", "might be a few people in the nearby", "81:13", "community that's worried about more", "81:14", "mountain lions coming or something but", "81:16", "yes we don't think that's a realistic", "81:17", "thing because you're ovulating at", "81:19", "holding capacity from as far as we", "81:21", "understand so we don't think that's", "81:23", "going to be a major issue but it's", "81:26", "really about funding we're trying to", "81:27", "National Wildlife Federation's leading", "81:29", "the charge to try to raise I think the", "81:31", "cost is over fifty million dollars to do", "81:34", "this yeah so it's a big price tag the", "81:37", "bridge is going to be quite wide it's", "81:38", "going to be natural covered and it's", "81:40", "going to ask to go over the gora Road", "81:42", "and the 101 both and so why don't it's", "81:46", "going to be a big bridge so why does", "81:49", "that oh I wish I could call that of top", "81:51", "of my head I", "81:52", "yeah sorry you'd have to look it up I", "81:54", "think it's probably on that thing you", "81:55", "had up earlier so you probably deal with", "81:57", "a few hundred yards or something yeah I", "81:59", "mean it's almost as wide as it is long", "82:01", "oh wow so it's gonna be big it's gonna", "82:03", "also have it's going to be used for", "82:05", "hiking during the day as well so it's", "82:06", "not just for wildlife so people can go", "82:09", "across it exactly because currently", "82:11", "there's no easy way to go from the the", "82:15", "Santa Monica's in the south to the Simi", "82:17", "Hills in the north which are all public", "82:19", "property so there's no way to get across", "82:21", "there so people can hike they have to go", "82:22", "down on the Liberty Canyon Road and cut", "82:26", "across there which is kind of sucky so", "82:28", "how does one raise money for something", "82:30", "like this do they try to have like a", "82:32", "GoFundMe or do they just rely on the", "82:34", "state budget no after all they're doing", "82:38", "fundraising trying to get people to kick", "82:39", "in I believe the Annenberg has already", "82:41", "offered to donate a million dollars", "82:44", "matching so they've got to raise another", "82:46", "million to get that amount it's all for", "82:50", "the most part I believe it's all from", "82:51", "either conservation agencies or from", "82:54", "private donations so if you were king in", "82:56", "the world that would be the first thing", "82:57", "that you would work on as far as", "82:59", "wildlife in California", "83:02", "definitely for our region yes what about", "83:03", "other issues other issues I mean habitat", "83:06", "protections just obviously incredibly", "83:07", "important if we want to keep all of our", "83:09", "species so protecting more land is", "83:11", "there's always a valuable thing to make", "83:13", "sure that or at least make sure what", "83:15", "development we do is done in a proper", "83:17", "way", "83:17", "now when you say protect more land would", "83:19", "that be like buying up available private", "83:21", "land when it comes for sale and then", "83:23", "turning it into public land um to some", "83:26", "level I would consider that I don't know", "83:27", "if that would be my ultimate goal to me", "83:29", "it's more important to lock it up so", "83:31", "it's natural versus public versus", "83:33", "private oh so like to stop development", "83:36", "stop major developments from going in", "83:37", "and putting things right in places that", "83:39", "are going to be major blockages to", "83:41", "wildlife movement", "83:41", "yeah Boulder is kind of interesting in", "83:43", "that way where they buy up all the", "83:44", "available property and then turn into", "83:46", "open space yeah so you can't develop on", "83:48", "it ever yeah they're really smart with", "83:51", "that because they think Boulder is an", "83:53", "amazing place and that they've really", "83:55", "recognized that they have this", "83:56", "incredible sort of beautiful little", "83:59", "community that's surrounded by this", "84:01", "inescapable beauty of the mountains the", "84:05", "he's you know get much more beautiful", "84:07", "place and run boulders no make sense I", "84:09", "mean if you want to keep your", "84:09", "communities", "84:10", "the way they are you kind of have to", "84:11", "protect them the land yeah they're not", "84:13", "into anybody developing there they're", "84:15", "like no no let's not do that if you see", "84:17", "really wise of them but it's amazing", "84:19", "that they've a mad a managed rather to", "84:22", "go so long without being co-opted by", "84:24", "money you know mm-hmm", "84:26", "yeah I mean that's kind of the name of", "84:27", "the game I mean obviously we need", "84:29", "developments because our populations", "84:31", "keep growing so to me it's not always", "84:33", "realistic to say we need to protect", "84:35", "every piece of land we can protect right", "84:37", "what development we do we need to do it", "84:39", "smart and make sure that things are", "84:41", "protected in the proper places is there", "84:43", "any other wildlife issues in and around", "84:45", "this area that uh are being addressed", "84:47", "right now um I mean that's that those", "84:51", "are the two biggest things going on that", "84:54", "were we're actively trying to deal with", "84:57", "yeah I can't think of too many I mean", "84:59", "there's always the little nuisance", "85:00", "issues that everybody's trying to deal", "85:02", "with where a coyote is in somebody's", "85:04", "yard or going after dogs or whatever", "85:05", "that we try to deal with but those are", "85:07", "the two major ones would be connectivity", "85:09", "habitat loss and then just poisons and", "85:13", "there are a lot of raccoons in this area", "85:15", "um a lot I would depends what you", "85:21", "comparing healthy population yeah", "85:22", "there's a decent number of raccoons if", "85:23", "you're comparing it to somewhere like", "85:24", "Chicago no we don't have goggles larger", "85:27", "population of Raccoon yeah they're just", "85:29", "much more adept there they're just the", "85:32", "way the landscape is a lot more mature", "85:33", "trees mature forest which is what", "85:35", "raccoons like a lot more water which are", "85:38", "all things that attract raccoons we're", "85:39", "we're a lot drier raccoons can occur", "85:43", "within like our mountains but they do", "85:45", "seem to be more focused near roadways", "85:47", "and some of that stuff taken advantage", "85:49", "of whatever resources are there well", "85:51", "they're big garbage hunters too right", "85:52", "they definitely take advantage of", "85:54", "garbage they'll also eat lots of fruits", "85:55", "and stuff so some of the scats you see", "85:57", "in your yard that you think are coyotes", "85:58", "they could be raccoon as well they eat a", "86:01", "lot of berries and stuff so yeah found", "86:03", "some skunk poop we're friends yeah my", "86:05", "friend who recognized the mountain lion", "86:07", "poop I sent him some stuff and I said", "86:09", "what is this he said that skunk poop", "86:11", "skunks are amazing like I before I start", "86:15", "tracking these coyotes in downtown LA oh", "86:16", "I never thought skunks could be down in", "86:18", "that area", "86:19", "there's actually decent number skunks", "86:20", "like in that Westlake neighborhood yeah", "86:22", "I could not believe how many skunks I've", "86:24", "seen I smelled skunk in Hollywood last", "86:25", "night I was driving through it could", "86:27", "have been strong weed but I don't think", "86:28", "it was I'm pretty sure it was an actual", "86:30", "Scott okay I was leaving the Comedy", "86:32", "Store and it just stunk of skunk and I", "86:34", "was like how weird that these animals", "86:36", "have figured out a way to live right", "86:37", "here in like right near sunset yeah I", "86:40", "know and air I mean little short legs", "86:42", "not super mobile but yet these striped", "86:44", "skunks seem to have figured it out", "86:47", "yeah they did they were going after my", "86:48", "chickens two little creeps really yeah", "86:50", "yeah they're there apparently they like", "86:52", "to eat chickens huh that's interesting", "86:54", "yeah one night I actually had a we were", "86:56", "sitting in the house me my wife just", "86:57", "hanging out also here my chickens going", "86:59", "crazy out there and I'm like we both got", "87:00", "up and took off run and we have a lot of", "87:02", "feral cats around our house and I was", "87:04", "like listing cats are in there we go", "87:06", "looking around our chickens are flying", "87:07", "all over the yard because we hadn't gone", "87:09", "out and closed the door yet because my", "87:10", "chickens can kind of free-range my yard", "87:12", "and we're looking around we'll see", "87:13", "anything also I open up the coop door", "87:14", "and there's a big old possum just", "87:16", "sitting there grinning at me", "87:17", "oh those criminals oh yeah so I didn't", "87:20", "get anything it didn't affect didn't", "87:21", "grab one of my chickens even though one", "87:23", "of my chickens was just sitting there", "87:23", "like looking at it and squawking it's", "87:26", "like you should be he was trying he was", "87:28", "trying but he just didn't they're not", "87:30", "very fast they're not yeah they're with", "87:33", "possums you like for me they're another", "87:35", "species you don't need a drug to handle", "87:37", "I can just you just grab them up by the", "87:39", "tail usually and oh really hold on to a", "87:41", "man now you could just run up to him and", "87:42", "grab them people do there's definitely", "87:45", "there was a guy doing his master's work", "87:47", "on possums and he would drive around", "87:48", "town and when he saw one he'd jump out", "87:51", "of his car", "87:52", "he's he out hanging out his friends you", "87:53", "see a possum jump out grab it cram it in", "87:55", "his trunk oh Jesus Christ", "87:57", "and throw it in his trunk yeah that's", "88:00", "that's dedication right there what did", "88:02", "he do with it once he got it in his", "88:03", "trunk he was collared him he's doing", "88:05", "kind of like what we do here trying to", "88:06", "identify their movements and it's going", "88:08", "on with them what did they find out", "88:10", "anything unusual I don't know I've never", "88:11", "saw his talk I wasn't like I'd ran into", "88:13", "him at a conference one time we got", "88:15", "chatting about what he did and I was", "88:16", "like that's pretty hilarious it is", "88:18", "really weird how many animals we live", "88:20", "around I mean it's really weird there's", "88:22", "so many different and such a wide", "88:25", "variety especially when it comes to", "88:26", "birds you know one thing that I see a", "88:28", "lot of is there's a lot of Hawks in my", "88:31", "name", "88:31", "and we did this thing in our backyard", "88:33", "well we had a wrought iron fence and we", "88:36", "changed part of it and put a glass fence", "88:38", "and these Hawks hadn't figured it out", "88:40", "and they would swoop down and slamming", "88:43", "the fence headfirst week' out quite a", "88:45", "few these poor Hawks", "88:47", "I can imagine yeah but it's just amazing", "88:50", "how many you find out there and how many", "88:52", "predators mmm and there's the occasional", "88:54", "golden eagle in this area too right we", "88:57", "get reports of them coming through every", "88:58", "once in a while yeah it's they're not", "89:00", "super rare by any mean or super common", "89:02", "by any means but they come through now", "89:04", "and when you know whether or not you're", "89:07", "looking at a golden eagle just because", "89:08", "it's really big it's really big there's", "89:10", "some other little characteristics that", "89:11", "I'm not as good with but they're", "89:13", "significantly larger than like the Red", "89:14", "Tails which would be the one you'd be", "89:16", "most likely to confuse it with yeah it's", "89:18", "just the wide variety of different", "89:22", "Raptors and these yeah it's amazing I", "89:25", "mean I'd shouldered Hawks everyone smile", "89:26", "we'll be trapping four bobcats and we'll", "89:27", "catch a red shouldered Hawk on our traps", "89:29", "it's like close so cool we've even", "89:31", "caught a great horned owl once and so", "89:34", "it's pretty neat seeing some of these", "89:35", "animals up close yeah I'm worried that", "89:37", "the owls in my neighborhood have been", "89:39", "poisoned because I used to have quite a", "89:41", "few of them and you used to hear them",
