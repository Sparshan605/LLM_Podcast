interesting history there", "05:46", "because in new york city for example", "05:49", "it was difficult to outlaw like the", "05:50", "three card monty guys on the sidewalk", "05:52", "with the cardboard because", "05:53", "it's just kind of a game right now now", "05:56", "it would be illegal to sell fraudulent", "05:58", "stocks or something like that", "06:00", "or sell a product that's advertised as a", "06:03", "health product when it's not but if", "06:05", "say in that case it's under food rather", "06:08", "than drugs or say no health products", "06:11", "like vitamins are under different", "06:13", "standards than", "06:14", "say medical drugs a psychic is more like", "06:18", "an entertainer so this is for", "06:20", "entertainment purposes only so we can do", "06:23", "whatever we want", "06:23", "as opposed to a medical doctor that's", "06:25", "dispensing advice", "06:27", "so maybe a doctor's a bad example maybe", "06:30", "i should have said engineer", "06:31", "but the point is like if you're going to", "06:34", "work as a psychic", "06:36", "like on a psychic network if you have a", "06:38", "business of selling", "06:39", "psychics yeah like you should be able to", "06:42", "you have to exhibit", "06:43", "some sort of psychic something yeah well", "06:45", "they can't", "06:46", "uh you know under controlled conditions", "06:47", "they always fail there's nothing that's", "06:49", "ever been done", "06:50", "no no what about the one thing that i've", "06:52", "read that uh", "06:53", "statistically more people can recognize", "06:56", "that people are staring at them", "06:58", "yeah like when they're looking at you", "06:59", "from behind that horseshit well it's not", "07:01", "been", "07:02", "it's not been consistently replicated um", "07:05", "so is it possible that some people with", "07:07", "a certain sensitivity", "07:09", "can detect well we okay so one", "07:10", "explanation the skeptic's explanation is", "07:12", "that", "07:13", "if i'm in a say a starbucks or something", "07:15", "and i kind of have a sense that people", "07:16", "are talking about", "07:17", "maybe looking at me and and and i look", "07:20", "and that catches somebody's eye and they", "07:22", "turn to me and i think oh that person is", "07:24", "looking at me", "07:25", "or vice versa i'm looking at them and", "07:27", "then they send something or whatever so", "07:29", "there could be some element", "07:30", "of chance to that now um the guy that", "07:32", "does this rupert sheldrake", "07:34", "um you know he believes that it's", "07:35", "actually some kind of like", "07:37", "psychic power through the medium like", "07:41", "when i'm looking at you something's", "07:42", "coming out of my eyes and", "07:44", "tickling your neck so that's his morphic", "07:46", "resonance morphic resonance now", "07:48", "richard wiseman a british experimental", "07:50", "psychologist he's tried to replicate", "07:53", "that and he always fails and then this", "07:54", "other woman marilyn schlitz she also", "07:56", "tried to replicate it and she was able", "07:58", "to replicate some of it", "07:59", "so there may be an experiment or bias", "08:02", "it's not clear if it's the skeptics that", "08:03", "are biased or the believers that are", "08:05", "biased but", "08:06", "in that case it's best to just say you", "08:08", "know we don't know it", "08:09", "so the default position the null", "08:11", "hypothesis is that it's not true", "08:13", "until you prove otherwise and that's a", "08:15", "that's a difficult one to prove now", "08:17", "if if they say if i say well why is the", "08:19", "effect so subtle why can't", "08:21", "you go to vegas and become a millionaire", "08:23", "gambling", "08:24", "or play the stock market you know we", "08:26", "know traders just need a tiny you know", "08:28", "1.01 percent advantage over the other", "08:30", "traders or whatever they can make", "08:31", "in terms of just psychic ability yeah so", "08:33", "if the psychic ability is a very broad", "08:34", "term right it's almost like saying drugs", "08:37", "because like yeah there are certain", "08:38", "drugs that put you to sleep and certain", "08:40", "drugs that make you hyper", "08:41", "they have very different effects so", "08:43", "saying psychic ability like maybe you", "08:44", "have the ability to see if someone's", "08:46", "looking at you", "08:46", "but you don't have the ability to pick", "08:48", "the lottery right so the hard part in", "08:50", "testing psychics is to pin down", "08:52", "what exactly are you saying you could do", "08:54", "right and that that's where it gets", "08:56", "pretty fuzzy", "08:57", "so these like why is it legal for the", "08:59", "phone psychics because", "09:00", "that you can't pin them down if somebody", "09:02", "says look i'm just giving relationship", "09:04", "advice", "09:04", "why is that illegal if i say like the", "09:07", "tony robbins netflix documentary i'm not", "09:09", "your guru which is basically i am your", "09:11", "guru", "09:12", "he has that moment in this huge", "09:14", "auditorium there's like 3 000 people", "09:15", "there and he gets this woman up on stage", "09:18", "and she's got relationship problems he", "09:19", "says do you have your phone", "09:21", "she goes yeah take out your phone and", "09:22", "call him right now", "09:24", "and she he talks her through dumping", "09:26", "this guy", "09:27", "on stage on the phone and he's at work", "09:29", "or something he's like what", "09:31", "and then she hangs up and everybody's", "09:33", "happy that she did this now", "09:34", "is that a good thing or a bad thing i", "09:37", "have no idea it's great for show", "09:38", "business but what if", "09:40", "you know so how the fuck i mean that", "09:42", "seems crazy like how do you know what", "09:44", "kind of relationship they really have", "09:46", "now somebody had talked to both of them", "09:47", "right wouldn't you somebody that i", "09:49", "brought this up", "09:50", "at an event recently a party and", "09:52", "somebody said oh i know the back story", "09:54", "his staff had been working the audience", "09:56", "and they they knew all about her and the", "09:58", "relationship", "09:59", "and it was about to go sour anyway so we", "10:02", "brought her up", "10:03", "it's like okay so this is the thing with", "10:05", "you see the psychics on tv there's a lot", "10:06", "of stuff you don't see", "10:08", "they work the audience they know people", "10:10", "fill out like", "10:11", "the psych the faith healers they fill", "10:13", "out prayer cards yeah they put their", "10:14", "name and address and their ailment", "10:16", "and then you know the faith healers have", "10:18", "a little earbud in there and they're", "10:20", "listening to the person in the back", "10:21", "reading okay here's the person they have", "10:23", "you know glaucoma or whatever", "10:25", "and you hear them calling this out so uh", "10:28", "so there's a lot of that that we don't", "10:29", "see", "10:29", "but anthony robbins is not claiming any", "10:32", "kind of psychic ability he's just", "10:34", "he's just trying to provide positive", "10:36", "paths for improving your life", "10:38", "and if you're in a bad relationship that", "10:40", "would be a positive path let's get out", "10:41", "of that relationship and", "10:42", "just like move forward with it with", "10:45", "emotion", "10:46", "and power and love and he'd fucking", "10:48", "probably throw a karate kick and get", "10:50", "everybody pumped up and jump around", "10:52", "his little bobby brown headphones on you", "10:54", "know", "10:55", "it's like but he's he's a showman too", "10:58", "yeah that's right so this but but my", "11:00", "point is that the psychic could say the", "11:01", "same thing look i'm just", "11:02", "dishing out you know i don't know but", "11:04", "he's not i mean it's weird to put him in", "11:06", "that category right because he's just", "11:07", "trying to get people excited", "11:09", "he i think he does some good i really do", "11:12", "because he did me some good", "11:13", "when i was uh 21 years old i used to", "11:16", "listen to his", "11:17", "i think it was called unlimited power i", "11:19", "think that was the name of the book and", "11:21", "i listened to it on audio cassette by", "11:22", "the pools", "11:23", "shitty apartment that i was living in", "11:25", "when i was trying to be a

"11:51", "maybe air a little bit on the side of", "11:53", "over optimism so you can push through", "11:54", "the failures but don't be blind because", "11:56", "maybe it's", "11:57", "certain times to cut and run and change", "11:59", "of course in your life something like", "12:00", "that", "12:01", "the the hard part is getting is studying", "12:04", "that which you know experimentally which", "12:06", "are the best techniques", "12:07", "versus others and um there was a guy", "12:10", "wrote a book called sham s-h-a-m", "12:12", "self-help actualization movement and he", "12:14", "was the

reason why men are more", "79:51", "attracted to these fields and they're", "79:52", "like", "79:53", "sexist and he's like no no no no these", "79:56", "are the studies", "79:57", "this is what you're asking me to do the", "79:59", "the concern that", "80:00", "if the science doesn't come out a", "80:02", "certain way then people won't be treated", "80:03", "equally", "80:04", "is a bad idea

here something", "81:03", "like that", "81:04", "so that's the problem with those right", "81:06", "but it's not the only option today", "81:08", "when you see that i mean i know he's not", "81:10",

do you think people are", "90:48", "going to get that i don't know he's out", "90:50", "so this is what he said i had my", "90:51", "umbrella because i didn't like what", "90:52", "kennedy was doing with castro and the", "90:54", "cubans", "90:56", "okay so in other words the umbrella", "90:58", "meant nothing", "90:59", "uh in terms of the assassination right", "91:01", "and this is true so like", "91:03", "911 oh there was this little puff of", "91:05", "smoke or somebody found this passport", "91:06", "over here this little thing", "91:08", "all those little things really it's just",

it's", "91:34", "the one that looks crazy is uh building", "91:36", "seven tower seven", "91:37", "that one looks crazy it does but it", "91:39", "burned for like eight hours or something", "91:41",

watched the interior cave-in", "92:01", "and that as this fire was burning", "92:03", "because apparently there was", "92:04", "obviously i don't know what really would", "92:05", "happen but there was diesel tanks", "92:07", "apparently in the basement", "92:09", "and the diesel fuel would burn", "92:10", "incredibly hot and the whole", "92:12", "inside of it all the structure had been",

building", "92:26", "i would sue", "92:26", "everybody i mean that's i mean he got", "92:28", "his money back i guess because there's", "92:29", "some insurance", "92:30", "money but that what a terrible design", "92:33", "there was some", "92:34", "uh issue with the legal insurance payout", "92:37", "to the owner of the world trade center", "92:39", "buildings whether this was", "92:40", "like one one event or two events or one", "92:43", "building or two", "92:44", "you know what is it was it the", "92:46", "difference was between like eight", "92:47", "billion and sixteen billion dollar", "92:49", "payout or something", "92:50", "wow how do they get people to get into", "92:53", "that new building", "92:54", "i'd be like fuck you i'm not i'm not", "92:56", "renting an office in this building this", "92:58", "building they blew it up in 93 they blew", "93:00", "it up again in 2001", "93:01", "get out of here with this shit i'm not", "93:04", "taking a chance with this new ass", "93:05", "building what is it the freedom tower or", "93:06", "something like that this is a big old", "93:08", "bullseye", "93:09", "yeah yeah i haven't been in it yet i've", "93:11", "been around it but", "93:12", "it's not even that big well it's i think", "93:15", "it's just i think it's taller than the", "93:16", "it's not it's not it's not as big as the", "93:20", "original towers right i think it is tall", "93:21", "i think is it yeah i think i think so", "93:23", "yeah i thought it was shorter it's", "93:25", "definitely not as big as the one in", "93:26", "dubai the dubai one's like a half a mile", "93:28", "right isn't something crazy like that i", "93:30", "don't know", "93:31", "how tall is the tallest building it is i", "93:34", "just went to their", "93:35", "the one world trade center leasing page", "93:37", "it says at 1776 feet one world trade", "93:39", "center is the tallest", "93:41", "l-e-e-e-d gold certified building in the", "93:44", "western hemisphere", "93:45", "that's not good enough whatever that i", "93:46", "don't know this is america we need to be", "93:47", "number one", "93:48", "number one we need to go straight to the", "93:49", "moon in the solar system yeah we need to", "93:51", "take an elevator right to the fucking", "93:53", "moon", "93:55", "right outside of space is that possible", "93:58", "can they build a building that's so high", "94:00", "that it goes into space", "94:02", "why not i don't think so because", "94:03", "structurally it wouldn't hold", "94:05", "why not make it the shape of a pyramid", "94:07", "well it's like why aren't trees", "94:09", "you know a thousand feet tall because", "94:11", "the material would just collapse", "94:12", "and i don't i don't think you could have", "94:14", "it strong it'd have to be so fat", "94:15", "oh that's right japan was going to build", "94:17", "that space elevator oh look at it you", "94:19", "got jacked with the pop-ups", "94:21", "japan takes tiny first steps towards", "94:23", "space elevator yeah", "94:24", "you could fuck off i'm not getting in", "94:25", "that thing it would take a few years", "94:28", "before i'm willing to climb into that", "94:29", "sucker", "94:30", "but um so the other problem with", "94:33", "conspiracy is just get back there for a", "94:34", "moment is the problem of anomalies what", "94:36", "do you do with anomalies this is true in", "94:37", "all science", "94:38", "no theory explains every single thing", "94:41", "that's out there that we want to study", "94:43", "there's always going to be some like", "94:45", "quirky thing that the main theory here", "94:47", "that explains all these things here it", "94:48", "doesn't account for that", "94:50", "okay what did we do with that well my", "94:52", "joke is you assign it to a grad student", "94:54", "they let them figure it out but what", "94:56", "outsiders mistake", "94:58", "is that well my theory explains this", "95:00", "little anomaly so therefore it should", "95:02", "replace this theory", "95:04", "and so people like neil and sean carroll", "95:06", "lawrence krauss", "95:07", "michio kaku has like two web pages one", "95:10", "he has a link on his web page if you", "95:12", "have an alternative theory of physics go", "95:14", "to this page", "95:15", "so they go there and it is your theory", "95:18", "has to explain all of these things over", "95:19", "here that our theory currently explains", "95:22", "and your whatever your set anomaly is", "95:25", "and of course they can't so it's not", "95:28", "that scientists are", "95:29", "dogmatically close-minded to the", "95:31", "anomalies it's that", "95:33", "we can't explain everything and you", "95:35", "don't have to do anything with that just", "95:36", "just leave it there", "95:37", "maybe eventually they'll pile up and", "95:41", "there'll be a new theory like with", "95:42", "einstein's relativity okay there's", "95:44", "enough anomalies here", "95:46", "uh like the orbit of mercury and a few", "95:48", "other things and so we have to modify", "95:50", "newtonian", "95:51", "physics a little bit okay that happens", "95:54", "but for the most part like and so", "95:56", "conspiracies are filled with these", "95:57", "things like", "95:58", "the moment something big happens you go", "96:00", "back and okay but there's this weird", "96:02", "thing here how do you explain that", "96:04", "i don't know we don't have to explain", "96:06", "everything", "96:07", "do you know that there's a growing", "96:09", "movement that think that the", "96:10", "the space is fake space is fake no", "96:14", "this is different than the flat earth", "96:15", "google hashtag space is fake", "96:18", "hashtag spaces it's people that are so", "96:20", "fucking stupid the flat earthers kicked", "96:22", "them out oh my god", "96:24", "for real flat earthers kicked out the", "96:26", "spacious fake people", "96:27", "space's fake is they're the the most", "96:30", "skeptical", "96:31", "so what would be the upper atmosphere", "96:33", "would be the edge of the world it's all", "96:34", "fake it's the end and it's tied in some", "96:36", "weird way to religion which is really", "96:38", "interesting", "96:39", "because even the flat earth people", "96:40", "there's a tremendous amount of them that", "96:42", "are extremely religious", "96:43", "and they they talk about the firmament", "96:45", "and the bible and the bible and that", "96:47", "this is uh this is what's really going", "96:49", "on is that they're trying to keep us", "96:51", "from the knowledge that", "96:53", "god has created this place is a very", "96:55", "special place right", "96:56", "and so by pretending that it's round", "97:00", "they somehow or another are controlling", "97:03", "us", "97:03", "we're thinking that we're not", "97:04", "exceptional and we're not lucky space is", "97:06", "fake", "97:07", "they're using a video from uh that ryan", "97:09", "gosling's movie he just made about new", "97:11", "armstrong the first man on the moon yeah", "97:13", "just be like this is look look here's", "97:14", "proof this is how they fake everything", "97:16", "they're making a movie because the way", "97:18", "they made the movie is", "97:20", "that's evidence that it's fake because", "97:22", "he's wearing it i don't know if maybe", "97:23", "this person doesn't recognize that as", "97:25", "being ryan gosling right there", "97:26", "um he's got nasa suit on maybe it's just", "97:29", "a troll account", "97:30", "this is how nasa fakes everything this", "97:32", "is the video i was talking about guys", "97:35", "now you know it's all a big act hashtag", "97:39", "click on space is fake though oh that's", "97:41", "what i'm on i'm on the whole yeah but i", "97:42", "mean click on it because there's a bunch", "97:43", "of others", "97:44", "i'm on that thread there's a tremendous", "97:47", "amount of people that literally believe", "97:48", "that space is not real", "97:51", "google a video of uh how uh buzz aldrin", "97:54", "and how he deals with the", "97:56", "no moonies that we never went to the", "97:57", "moon there's a video buzz aldrin", "97:59", "punching a guy yeah have you seen that", "98:00", "that guy", "98:01", "i i had dinner with that guy you did the", "98:03", "guy he punched yeah i was a firm", "98:05", "believer that we never went to the moon", "98:07", "yeah you know this is what happened i", "98:08", "watched that uh fox documentary yep uh", "98:11", "the moon conspiracy theory did we go and", "98:13", "i was like holy shit", "98:14", "because it was on television i was and", "98:16", "this was um", "98:19", "96 97 i remember i went to work and i", "98:22", "told everybody you got to see this", "98:23", "documentary it's crazy we never went to", "98:25", "the moon", "98:25", "and uh i watched that one and i watched", "98:29", "this guy's um what is his name", "98:34", "so i had dinner with him he absolutely", "98:35", "believes that we never went to the moon", "98:37", "100 believes it i don't know if he still", "98:39", "believes it i think he's like a", "98:41", "cab driver or something now he got he", "98:42", "was involved in the news or", "98:45", "local television or something like that", "98:47", "back where he's from", "98:49", "um then he released a documentary called", "98:51", "the fun a funny thing happened on the", "98:52", "way to the moon", "98:53", "and in his documentary one of the things", "98:55", "he did have is some really interesting", "98:57", "footage", "98:58", "of the lunar module where", "99:01", "it looks like they're faking a shot of", "99:04", "them", "99:04", "being really far out but then when they", "99:07", "remove", "99:08", "this cover the covers from all the", "99:10", "windows that were inside the", "99:12", "the um the lunar not the lunar module", "99:15", "what is the one that the the orbiter", "99:17", "um it really looks like they're in low", "99:19", "earth orbit and this is like the", "99:21", "the main thing pointing to that like", "99:23", "they couldn't get out of low earth orbit", "99:26", "then there was also the fact that they", "99:28", "lost all of the", "99:30", "telemetry data which was the binary you", "99:33", "know the ones and zeros that showed the", "99:35", "position of the lunar module at every", "99:37", "stage", "99:38", "there was a bunch of different things", "99:39", "the fact that no one wanted especially", "99:41", "um neil armstrong he became a recluse", "99:43", "never wanted to talk about it", "99:45", "you go and watch the uh press conference", "99:47", "the press conference they look very", "99:49", "shady look like they're completely but", "99:51", "not like that he talks to everybody he", "99:53", "was drunk for a long time though", "99:54", "he was uh he was very depressed and had", "99:56", "when became an alcoholic", "99:58", "after the moon landing and the idea is", "100:00", "that", "100:01", "in conspiracy circles from talking as", "100:03", "them the idea is that he got over it", "100:05", "after a while and needed to make a", "100:06", "living and now he talks about it", "100:07", "constantly", "100:08", "but neil armstrong never did the thing", "100:10", "that's compelling", "100:12", "is that there was there were some", "100:15", "there's some faking going on um if you", "100:17", "look at", "100:18", "gemini was it gemini 15 michael collins", "100:22", "there's an image of michael collins when", "100:23", "they were testing", "100:25", "some of the space uh walking stuff and", "100:28", "some of the", "100:29", "some of the the things that they would", "100:30", "do to to to walk", "100:32", "outside of a spaceship um they they had", "100:35", "them all strapped up with cables and", "100:36", "they're just", "100:37", "experimenting with these things they", "100:39", "took that photograph", "100:40", "and then blacked out the background", "100:42", "probably some overzealous pr", "100:44", "agent and they're like in the pool and", "100:47", "right here so what it is is like so the", "100:50", "the first one", "100:51", "is clearly he's you know in a studio and", "100:54", "they're working on things and just", "100:55", "trying to", "100:56", "understand how all this stuff works and", "100:58", "the second one they took the exact same", "100:59", "photo and just reversed it", "101:01", "and blacked out the background and they", "101:03", "but this just", "101:04", "that doesn't mean that they didn't go to", "101:06", "the moon that just means that", "101:07", "someone got a hold of some photographs", "101:10", "and faked it", "101:11", "and it's way more likely that there was", "101:14", "more of that going on", "101:15", "than that people didn't actually go to", "101:17", "the moon right", "101:19", "yeah yeah yeah the thing about", "101:22", "going to the moon that's really", "101:23", "interesting is uh if", "101:25", "they can go again and they do go again", "101:28", "and they find all that stuff there", "101:30", "you know then everybody has to just go", "101:32", "oh yeah i guess we were wrong this stuff", "101:33", "is there i mean there is", "101:34", "there's instruments on there that we", "101:36", "still monitor that the", "101:38", "apollo astronauts left there well", "101:40", "they'll be monitored", "101:41", "we shoot a laser up there and it bounces", "101:43", "off yeah but you know a laser will also", "101:44", "bounce off the surface of the moon", "101:46", "yeah but i don't think like that not as", "101:48", "precise right right yeah", "101:49", "but the russians did that too with lunga", "101:51", "hood one", "101:52", "and two i believe they left uh solar or", "101:55", "fl or laser reflectors up there as well", "101:57", "with an unmanned missile japan has a", "101:59", "video footage as flash of like last week", "102:01", "yeah the dark side people said that's", "102:03", "all fake too of course", "102:04", "well space is fake dude there's no space", "102:07", "of course the moon is not even what is", "102:09", "the moon if space is fake", "102:10", "how do they explain that um the images", "102:13", "what's interesting is the images of the", "102:14", "dark side of the moon", "102:15", "look exactly like even like the landing", "102:18", "and", "102:19", "the whole setup looks very similar to", "102:21", "the apollo missions", "102:22", "so they would have to either be in", "102:24", "cahoots or", "102:25", "have worked together with same sound", "102:27", "studio yeah", "102:28", "to figure they use the old stuff yeah", "102:30", "look at it i mean this is the footage i", "102:32", "mean god damn that looks", "102:33", "eerily similar to uh what you saw", "102:37", "when the apollo astronauts were there i", "102:40", "think it is entirely possible that some", "102:42", "of the", "102:43", "um some of the practice film footage", "102:47", "of them you know on the surface or doing", "102:50", "things", "102:50", "turned out to be pushed off as", "102:54", "actual footage of moon landings i think", "102:57", "there was no television well back then", "103:00", "there was no internet", "103:01", "there was no vcrs there was no ability", "103:03", "to review things and watch them over", "103:05", "again", "103:06", "they projected something on television", "103:08", "one time and that was it", "103:10", "so when they released pressed releases", "103:13", "and videos it's entirely possible that", "103:15", "some of those videos that got through", "103:17", "were actually just tests it's entirely", "103:20", "possible that there was", "103:20", "just like the michael collins photos", "103:22", "that there was some fuckery going on", "103:24", "you're dealing with so many human beings", "103:26", "right you're dealing with so many people", "103:27", "yeah see that an estimated 530 million", "103:30", "people watched armstrong's televised", "103:32", "image and heard his voice described", "103:34", "okay what is that it was broadcasted", "103:36", "live like six hours that day", "103:37", "yes yeah it was actually broadcasted", "103:39", "live on um", "103:41", "a projection screen what they did was if", "103:43", "they didn't get a straight feed", "103:45", "they were filming uh the the footage", "103:48", "that was on a projection screen", "103:50", "that's how they did it and there's some", "103:51", "wonky shit that looks like they fall", "103:53", "down and then they get", "103:54", "pulled back up by wires when they're on", "103:56", "the surface of the moon", "103:57", "but again i think how much of that is", "104:00", "how much of that is actual footage of", "104:02", "them being on the moon", "104:03", "and how much of that is just test", "104:05", "footage i mean i don't know", "104:07", "i don't know i'm not sure about that", "104:10", "but i think also uh i don't know jack", "104:13", "shit about space travel", "104:14", "right i don't know anything about", "104:15", "astrophysics i don't know anything about", "104:18", "like", "104:18", "what it takes to land on the moon and", "104:20", "come back and whether or not", "104:22", "i'm and most of the people that talk", "104:23", "about this don't know that", "104:25", "but mythbusters did a nice episode on", "104:27", "you know did we fake going to the moon", "104:28", "and they showed a bunch of little things", "104:30", "for example on the moon with its gravity", "104:33", "when you", "104:34", "go something like that into the dust you", "104:36", "know the particles come up and they arc", "104:38", "back down in a certain way that would be", "104:39", "different than if you're on earth so the", "104:41", "gravity is different", "104:42", "causes the dust to settle very", "104:44", "differently there was a bunch of things", "104:45", "like that", "104:46", "that proved we we were there well it", "104:49", "certainly proved that what", "104:50", "took place took place in a vacuum yeah", "104:53", "not", "104:53", "yeah and a gravitational pull the same", "104:56", "as the moon", "104:57", "right the only um you've probably seen", "104:59", "the feather and the hammer drop", "105:00", "but you know you can do that here well", "105:03", "uh", "105:04", "yes in a vacuum yes that's right yeah", "105:06", "but but", "105:07", "even a feather and a hammer even if it's", "105:10", "it", "105:10", "depends upon what kind of feather it is", "105:12", "but a feather and a hammer even if you", "105:15", "just held them here and dropped them on", "105:16", "the ground they probably would land at a", "105:18", "very similar pace", "105:19", "there there's a spoof video about uh", "105:21", "that we never went to the moon but a", "105:23", "couple british", "105:24", "comedians that that people thing is that", "105:26", "with the kubrick one", "105:27", "no appeal what's their name uh", "105:31", "key and peel yeah so that the three of", "105:33", "them are talking and you know okay we're", "105:34", "gonna fake this whole thing and", "105:36", "and and then they're troubleshooters", "105:38", "she's like well um", "105:40", "now you know people are gonna ask well", "105:41", "how did we go to the moon", "105:43", "and we're going to have to you know", "105:44", "build a big rocket so we can say well we", "105:46", "went in that big rocket", "105:48", "and they're like well how much would it", "105:49", "cost to build that big rocket well it", "105:50", "would be really expensive i mean we", "105:52", "might as well just go to the moon", "105:53", "and then they'd start talking about the", "105:54", "expenses well we only have to feed three", "105:56", "of them if we go to the moon but if we", "105:57", "shoot it as a shoot here in the studio", "105:59", "we have to have catering for everybody", "106:01", "to be super expensive", "106:02", "and it kind of goes on like that it's", "106:03", "very funny that is funny but the the", "106:05", "conspiracy theorists would say", "106:07", "well they couldn't send someone to the", "106:09", "moon so they had to fake it that's why", "106:11", "they haven't been back", "106:12", "they went from 1969 to 1973", "106:15", "is that what it was six successful", "106:18", "missions", "106:18", "seven attempts apollo 13 being the one", "106:21", "that didn't make it", "106:23", "it's a it's a fun theory and what", "106:25", "happened with me", "106:26", "is i got way better at spotting bullshit", "106:29", "and", "106:30", "learning critical thinking skills and", "106:32", "then paying attention to all sides", "106:34", "i mean the the real issue", "106:37", "with something like that is if someone", "106:40", "could prove", "106:41", "definitively beyond a shadow of a doubt", "106:43", "that not only is it impossible", "106:45", "that no one ever went to the moon", "106:48", "absolutely prove it", "106:49", "that would be giant yeah i mean really", "106:51", "would be yeah i mean it would be a huge", "106:53", "story", "106:54", "but can is it even possible to do that", "106:56", "you know what", "106:58", "the other analogy i use like with the", "107:00", "wikileaks is there", "107:01", "of all those tens of thou hundreds of", "107:03", "thousands of memos and papers and", "107:05", "letters and government documents there's", "107:06", "not one mention anywhere of 911 as an", "107:09", "inside job you know", "107:10", "and we had to allocate these funds to go", "107:12", "to this construction company who was", "107:14", "then", "107:15", "you know seen working at the world trade", "107:16", "center but nothing like that so that", "107:18", "in this case the absence of evidence is", "107:21", "evidence of absence", "107:22", "it didn't happen not an inside job and", "107:24", "then 9 11", "107:26", "yeah and something like that would be", "107:28", "true for the moon landing i mean all", "107:29", "those people that worked on that not one", "107:31", "of them", "107:32", "saw anything and wanted to write a book", "107:34", "go on 60 minutes the idea would be that", "107:36", "it was compartmentalized and that", "107:38", "everyone like say if you're working on", "107:40", "the o-rings you don't have access to the", "107:42", "people that are working on the thrusters", "107:43", "if you have access to this you don't", "107:44", "have access to that", "107:46", "and that there was only a very small", "107:48", "group of people that controlled", "107:49", "everything", "107:50", "also 1969 was a very different", "107:52", "environment in terms of like what you", "107:54", "get away with and not get away with what", "107:55", "you could say", "107:56", "it's just it was really fun it was", "107:59", "really fun to believe that they had fake", "108:00", "going to the moon and i spent an", "108:01", "inordinate amount of time", "108:03", "uh looking at it but i completely", "108:05", "dropped it i completely dropped it after", "108:06", "i", "108:07", "i just i paid attention to what i", "108:10", "actually know", "108:11", "so but now you can kind of uh empathize", "108:13", "with those who do believe", "108:15", "crazy theories because oh yeah but you", "108:17", "want to hear a dumber one yeah here's a", "108:18", "dumber one", "108:19", "uh for the longest time like months i", "108:21", "believed in the thing called", "108:23", "rods do you know what about the rods the", "108:25", "little insects", "108:26", "yes yeah well they what it this guy", "108:29", "put out this duck this documentary that", "108:32", "there was these things flying so fast we", "108:34", "couldn't see them with the naked eye", "108:36", "right and that they were like", "108:38", "jellyfish-like creatures", "108:39", "that lived amongst us and uh they had", "108:42", "all this video footage of the", "108:44", "especially these people that were", "108:45", "jumping uh they were skydiving into this", "108:48", "enormous cave in mexico", "108:50", "and uh as they're skydiving into this", "108:52", "cave you see those things flying back", "108:53", "and forth", "108:54", "and i was hook line and sinker i was", "108:57", "like oh my god these things are around", "108:58", "us all the time", "108:59", "i was going outside looking up trying to", "109:01", "spot them like imagine there's", "109:03", "these beings that are flying so fast", "109:05", "that we can't we can't see them", "109:06", "the only way you capture is on camera", "109:08", "and then a show called monster quest", "109:11", "crack the riddle right they show that", "109:13", "it's a video artifact", "109:14", "and then if you have really high speed", "109:16", "camera you just see the insect", "109:18", "right but if you have low speeds", "109:20", "standard definition", "109:21", "video cameras it creates this artifact", "109:23", "as these things pass by very close to", "109:25", "the lens", "109:26", "at a high rate of speed it elongates", "109:28", "their video signal", "109:29", "and it makes them look like like this", "109:32", "jellyfish type thing", "109:33", "right but it's really just a video", "109:35", "artifact yeah again it's a good example", "109:37", "of anomalies you know here's this weird", "109:39", "video anomaly", "109:40", "what is it how about just say i don't", "109:42", "know well if you don't know anything", "109:44", "about video", "109:45", "it's it's way easier to say oh that's", "109:48", "the capture", "109:48", "that's right yeah you know take a camera", "109:50", "put it outside you will capture these", "109:52", "things i'm amazing", "109:53", "right yeah that's right um the other", "109:56", "aspect with conspiracy theories is", "109:58", "cognitive dissonance that is we want", "109:59", "the size of the event to be matched by a", "110:02", "cause that's equally", "110:04", "of that size so the analogy uses you", "110:07", "know the holocaust", "110:08", "the worst genocide in human history", "110:11", "caused by the nazis the worst regime", "110:13", "political regime in human history", "110:15", "there's a match there right", "110:16", "but if you say something like uh you", "110:18", "know jfk the leader of the free world", "110:20", "brought down by who lee harvey also just", "110:23", "some nobody you know there's this", "110:24", "mismatch or", "110:25", "911 this huge thing by 19 guys with box", "110:28", "cutters", "110:28", "do you think that doesn't harvey oswald", "110:30", "acted alone yeah do you really what", "110:31", "makes you think that", "110:33", "all of the evidence and none of the", "110:34", "evidence against anybody else", "110:36", "and all of the evidence against", "110:37", "particularly him the gerald posner's", "110:40", "book case closed and then", "110:42", "um the attorney what's his name that was", "110:44", "the uh", "110:45", "madison attorney yeah uh he his", "110:49", "name he has a massive book where he", "110:50", "lines up every single one of the", "110:53", "arguments by the jfk conspiracy for", "110:55", "example", "110:56", "conspiracies make a big deal about how", "110:58", "oswald got a job", "111:00", "at the book depository building which", "111:02", "just happened to be where the parade", "111:04", "just happened to be where the parade", "111:05", "route was going so you could have a", "111:06", "clear shot", "111:07", "so it was posner that tracked down when", "111:10", "the white house determined even when", "111:12", "kennedy was going to dallas let alone", "111:13", "what the parade route would be", "111:15", "and oswald already had the job there", "111:17", "that's just chance", "111:19", "so he knew in advance bro he was the", "111:21", "three he knew that he knew", "111:22", "do you think it's possible that oswald", "111:24", "was in cahoots", "111:26", "no no no why do you think that what", "111:29", "about the magic bullet theory", "111:31", "uh well that's been settled by the fact", "111:32", "that the way it showed in", "111:34", "in the videos is that the two seats are", "111:36", "like this and that the bullet has to do", "111:38", "this well in fact the seats were like", "111:40", "that", "111:40", "and that connolly was well you're", "111:42", "explaining this um in audio form just", "111:44", "when you're saying", "111:45", "oh yeah so it's like stadium seating", "111:47", "right one's elevated above the other one", "111:48", "that's right", "111:49", "so the bullet actually does when it", "111:50", "passes through the neck", "111:52", "through kennedy's neck and then hits", "111:54", "connolly's shoulder", "111:55", "it it is already moving down i think it", "111:57", "hit his wrist it fractures his wrist", "111:59", "right um the this has been tested and", "112:02", "tested and tested", "112:03", "well sort of here's here's my issue with", "112:05", "it there's a couple issues one uh", "112:07", "on the on the pro side uh the idea that", "112:09", "bullets will take a straight path", "112:11", "is ridiculous i've i've talked to", "112:14", "hunters that have shot", "112:15", "animals uh in the front and had a bullet", "112:19", "come out the same side they shot it it", "112:20", "ricocheted off bones and and came out", "112:22", "like the front of the animal like", "112:25", "bullets take weird paths", "112:26", "when they hit things in particular uh so", "112:28", "do arrows", "112:29", "they take and as a person who's", "112:32", "well-versed in firearms and shot animals", "112:36", "and hunted", "112:37", "this you don't sometimes the bullet goes", "112:40", "straight through", "112:41", "and sometimes it hits bones and wacky", "112:43", "things happen things deflect", "112:45", "but on the negative side they always", "112:47", "distort", "112:48", "bullets always distort particularly when", "112:50", "they hit bone what bothered me was that", "112:52", "they found that bullet", "112:54", "in connelly's gurney when they brought", "112:57", "him to the hospital they just", "112:58", "conveniently found this bullet aha we", "113:00", "have it this is the bullet it matches", "113:01", "the", "113:02", "the same rifle yeah and but it wasn't", "113:04", "pristine it was flattened", "113:06", "barely if you look at that bullet that", "113:08", "bullet is", "113:10", "nothing like a bullet that's hit bone", "113:11", "when bullets hit bone", "113:13", "they mushroom they balloon they bend", "113:15", "they distort wildly", "113:16", "they don't come out looking like that", "113:17", "they come out looking like that when you", "113:19", "shoot them into water", "113:20", "or when you shoot them into like", "113:22", "feathers they don't come out looking", "113:24", "like that", "113:24", "under normal circumstances when they", "113:26", "shatter the bone of two different people", "113:28", "well do you know that for sure no i do", "113:30", "not know that for sure", "113:31", "but um one thing i do know a lot about", "113:34", "is", "113:35", "i don't i know quite a bit about what", "113:37", "bullets look like when they hit things", "113:38", "i've looked into this pretty extensively", "113:40", "and i've talked to a lot of people in", "113:42", "law enforcement", "113:42", "military hunters and none of them", "113:45", "believed that that bullet", "113:47", "hit bones shattered bones and came out", "113:49", "looking like that", "113:50", "is it possible that that bullet was the", "113:52", "only bullet ever in the history of the", "113:54", "world that did do that", "113:55", "yeah it might be okay so we're getting", "113:57", "kind of caught up in the weeds of the", "113:59", "anomalies what about this just the", "114:01", "bullet uh oswald himself", "114:04", "had attempted to assassinate a general", "114:06", "named walker", "114:07", "six months before with his rifle and a", "114:10", "handgun and he went over to the house he", "114:12", "took a shot through the guys", "114:13", "when he saw him at the desk took a shot", "114:15", "missed him uh he told his wife about it", "114:18", "he's i'm a revolutionary i'm trying to", "114:20", "start so don't give me don't get me", "114:21", "wrong i'm not", "114:22", "saying that oswald was innocent i'm not", "114:24", "i mean and i think it's very possible", "114:26", "that oswald did", "114:27", "shoot at the president he might have", "114:28", "even hit the president it's also very", "114:31", "possibly that some other people were", "114:32", "involved as well", "114:33", "who i don't know see this is the problem", "114:35", "but wait a minute why is it a problem if", "114:36", "you don't know who they are", "114:38", "just because you don't know who they are", "114:39", "doesn't mean it didn't exist okay but", "114:40", "but why do we need to postulate", "114:42", "extra people because of all the gunshots", "114:44", "that happen in the short amount of time", "114:46", "the fact the reason why they", "114:47", "came up with the theory of the magic", "114:49", "bullet in the first place because they", "114:50", "had to account for a bullet that hit a", "114:52", "curb", "114:52", "underneath the overpass do you know that", "114:54", "right yeah okay there's three there's", "114:56", "there's", "114:57", "okay if you know why they came out with", "114:59", "them yeah i've been there do you know", "115:00", "why they came up with it but it's short", "115:01", "i mean it's right there you could have", "115:03", "stopped this point", "115:04", "the point well it's
