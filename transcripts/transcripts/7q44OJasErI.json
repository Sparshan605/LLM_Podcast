think that was I don't think I", "160:59", "don't know maybe he couldn't have fought", "161:01", "him any other way but I don't think that", "161:03", "was the best strategy the dropping of", "161:05", "the hands and the moving toward him with", "161:06", "disdain but I mean maybe that would have", "161:08", "worked on some guys and maybe that has", "161:10", "worked on other guys like Rumble Johnson", "161:12", "it worked on him right you know he mean", "161:14", "he eventually puts that heat on you and", "161:15", "so many guys crack under that heat do", "161:17", "you want to see as a friend do you want", "161:18", "to see him fight a third fight that is", "161:20", "entirely dependent upon where his head's", "161:23", "at I mean if he first of all I'm sure", "161:26", "he's a very intelligent guy with a lot", "161:28", "of years of competition under spell", "161:31", "whether it's Olympics", "161:33", "you know wrestling at the highest level", "161:35", "whether it's UFC

gonna take some time off and he'll", "161:46", "probably consult with his family and", "161:47", "probably figure out what he wants to do", "161:48", "but I bet if I had to guess his", "161:51",

damn", "162:06", "hands up you know he didn't like it Bob", "162:09", "cook didn't like it he respected Steve", "162:10", "Steve a he's a giant man he's a fucking", "162:13", "big motherfucker big long tall Croatian", "162:16", "and he's tough as shit and I think", "162:19", "because Daniel knocked him out in the", "162:21", "first round in the first fight you know", "162:23", "he he believed he could knock him out", "162:26", "again", "162:26", "but Steve a could take a goddamn shot", "162:28", "this time you know I mean yeah it's you", "162:30", "never know why a guy gets knocked out", "162:33", "that way with one punch mean it was a", "162:34", "perfect punch for sure I mean the way he", "162:36", "threw it was beautiful the way he threw", "162:39", "it from inside the clinch it comes over", "162:40", "the top of the shoulder plan and lands", "162:42", "that perfect punch that Kos deep amy was", "162:44", "amazing yeah but it was also such a", "162:46", "competitive fight that I'm super", "162:48", "intrigued to see a third fight you know", "162:49", "it's not like it's not a foregone", "162:50", "conclusion the CP is gonna be able to do", "162:52", "that again Daniel he just can come back", "162:54", "with a better game plan one person he", "162:56", "could win that fight and it's in my", "162:58", "opinion the best fighter heavyweight", "162:59", "though I don't think ain't gon will be a", "163:02", "good fight but I think the CP went said", "163:03", "again I I'm not convinced I mean I think", "163:06", "in gone who might be the next guy oh say", "163:09", "you know I think he might be the champ", "163:10", "row well he's definitely got what it", "163:13", "takes because he's got one thing that", "163:17", "100% one punch knockout power 100% not a", "163:21", "fucking human's gonna be there if he", "163:23", "full-on connects and smashes one through", "163:26", "your guard everyone goes night-night", "163:28", "everyone a hundred percent of the humans", "163:30", "that have ever walked in here", "163:32", "if that guy punches you full blast but", "163:35", "it's whether or not he's gonna be able", "163:36", "to do that too steep back we all thought", "163:37", "he had a chance of doing it the first", "163:39", "time but stipa shut it down and you know", "163:41", "maybe maybe he's better now but maybe", "163:43", "steep a is gonna come into this fight", "163:45", "even more energized ever after beating", "163:47", "DC and winning his title back I mean", "163:49", "maybe he's gonna maybe he saw something", "163:51", "from that fight that if you had to do it", "163:53", "again he would have implemented really", "163:54", "quickly you know the baby dude he did", "163:56", "not want to take another fight he was", "163:58", "whatever place he was in he was fucking", "164:01", "in his firehouse listed of his boots I", "164:03", "think if I get in that title back he", "164:05", "does not want to lose that title again", "164:06", "people were ignoring a man was weird", "164:08", "every I'm so concentrated on the Brock", "164:10", "lesner", "164:10", "idea that they were ignoring him it was", "164:14", "it's weird because when somebody said", "164:16", "that the other day whatever publication", "164:17", "was talking about see Bay being the", "164:19", "greatest heavyweight of all time this is", "164:20", "before the fight I remember going like", "164:23", "Izzy and then you start listing off his", "164:26", "credentials and you realize that he has", "164:28", "the most defenses he's also fought the", "164:30", "most competitive title defensive settle", "164:34", "defenses as well then you see it becomes", "164:37", "a little more apparent but I kind of", "164:38", "under I almost understand it because", "164:40", "even as and I'm a pretty big fan of the", "164:41", "sport but I remember just I wasn't like", "164:45", "chomping at the bit for the rematch for", "164:47", "him it wasn't like I was like I really", "164:49", "want to see that steep ad on Corey", "164:50", "mentioned I can't even put my finger on", "164:51", "why oh I did I wanted to see it bad I", "164:54", "wanted to see a real bad guy I wanted to", "164:56", "see", "164:57", "I liked the fact it was 13 months later", "164:59", "so I think it gave his body some time to", "165:01", "heal up I think you fighting gone it's", "165:03", "like getting hit by a train I mean you", "165:05", "might live fucking tree what happened", "165:13", "they hit just like when DJ Jazzy Jeff", "165:14", "will get thrown out", "165:18", "but I think he's if he keeps it together", "165:21", "he's the next guy I mean he's the next", "165:23", "guy in line to be the champion I mean he", "165:25", "has everything to lose", "165:26", "is he has the championship to lose if", "165:28", "it's deep a retires when Steve Bates", "165:30", "done Francis is the fucking man and", "165:32", "maybe maybe Francis beats him in a", "165:34", "rematch who knows again", "165:36", "all he has to do is connect he would be", "165:38", "a different guy in the rematch he would", "165:39", "understand what it's like to go five", "165:40", "hard rounds the guy who could take you", "165:42", "down and beat you up he would understand", "165:43", "that his wrestling has to be on point", "165:45", "his cardio has to be on point and", "165:46", "there's not gonna be times where he's", "165:48", "getting a hundred percent unload and", "165:50", "know for sure the guy's not going to be", "165:51", "there because the guy survived he didn't", "165:53", "have the gas tank for the remaining four", "165:55", "rounds and so this is gonna be a new guy", "165:58", "that steep a fights and he might very", "166:00", "well just play it smooth and just stay", "166:02", "on the outside and pick his shots and", "166:04", "then when he gets him hurt then uncork I", "166:07", "mean we don't know but we don't know", "166:09", "Stevie might take him down quicker this", "166:10", "time yeah maybe pea might say fuck all", "166:12", "this stand-up dude let's just wrestle", "166:14", "you know he just like come out I'm a", "166:16", "couple pump a few jabs and
