on site and then we", "42:04", "gather them all up when there's a", "42:05", "critical mass bring them in shred them", "42:08", "so that day I will shred them probably", "42:10", "about a week and a half later the", "42:12", "fermentation is done the hard part is", "42:14", "separating the applesauce from the juice", "42:17", "that's that's our part so a lot of", "42:20", "people will get them super ripe and they", "42:22", "they crush and press them so they just", "42:24", "get the juice right off the must and", "42:26", "they firm at just the juice other people", "42:28", "will shred them so there's just like", "42:30", "apple sauce and I'm gonna try to press", "42:32", "that through a very specific press that", "42:34", "kind of gets the juice away from the", "42:35", "what's the benefit of the former versus", "42:37", "of the latter", "42:38", "I do the third one I make it and I shred", "42:40", "it so there's applesauce and I'm s", "42:42", "you're fermenting on the at m-- on the", "42:44", "must on the applesauce hmm and then I", "42:46", "press as it starts to separate I'm", "42:48", "starting to pull the juice out once it's", "42:51", "fermented now have you done this because", "42:53", "you tried the other methods and you like", "42:55", "the flavor of this one better so how", "42:58", "many times you've guess I guess I've", "42:59", "done this 40 right that's because I'm a", "43:03", "liar I'm good at it no I've done it once", "43:07", "and it turned out so because I want to", "43:11", "make sure that that wasn't an accident", "43:13", "I'm gonna do it exactly like I did it", "43:16", "last time just see if it turns out the", "43:18", "same and when you did it did you do it", "43:20", "based on someone's recommendation or did", "43:22", "you have
