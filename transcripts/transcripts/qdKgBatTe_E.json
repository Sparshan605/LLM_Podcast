always down there's a", "18:30", "very weird way of moving very unorthodox", "18:32", "because he was such a big guy who sees", "18:34", "what seven yeah there was he was part of", "18:37", "the biggest guy you fought right yeah", "18:40", "you never fuckin Zyliss did you Michael", "18:42", "Grant was big Gonzalez are boxed in", "18:44", "kneeling okay Luis Gonzalez that was", "18:46", "named

"19:20", "rounds I was fighting to knock this guy", "19:21", "out because you had it in your mind yeah", "19:25", "this is the first time you ever see me", "19:28", "going forward in the fight this guy's", "19:29", "bigger than me I'm coming forward and", "19:32", "I'm throwing punches he's catching me", "19:34", "but those were the early rounds although", "19:36", "he's two inches taller than you you look", "19:38", "bigger than him this is a fella simply", "19:40", "physically yeah you're wider you know", "19:43", "when when you look back on your career", "19:44", "like do you have like a most satisfying", "19:47", "victory yeah what is it", "19:49", "awesome rock", "19:50", "say that house gonna say the rematch the", "19:52", "first or the second the second when a", "19:57", "guy when

rounds so", "20:33", "and then another reason a lot of people", "20:35", "don't know I went to Africa to fight", "20:36", "because Muhammad Ali went to Africa he", "20:38", "fought in Africa so I wanted to do that", "20:41", "I wanted to be I wanted to fight not for", "20:42", "guys you know I say I'm a world champion", "20:44", "so I need to fight all around the world", "20:47", "so that's what made me go to Africa", "20:50", "the only thing about Africa is I didn't", "20:52", "know that it was such a high altitude up", "20:54", "there and for me to have a fight I", "20:57", "should

working", "21:39", "out I was like throwing punches then I", "21:41", "found myself going", "21:43", "so had to take two steps back on like oh", "21:46", "no don't tell me this fight it's gonna", "21:47", "be one of those fights we have to take", "21:49", "my time so I basically went out there", "21:52", "taking my time I realized he's dealing", "21:54", "with the same thing I'm dealing with", "21:55", "although he was there a lot earlier but", "21:59", "you know I had a couple of things going", "22:01", "wrong boxing at 4:00 in the morning they", "22:04", "couldn't find a big enough ring then", "22:06", "they when they put the ring together it", "22:08", "was like eighteen by nineteen so and", "22:12", "then the the punch that actually hit me", "22:16", "I actually thought I was gonna

know that under the right", "22:38", "circumstances this guy is not at your", "22:41", "level in fact you know my problem was", "22:45", "solved before I got out of the ring I", "22:47", "knew what I did wrong which was the the", "22:48", "greatest thing that ever happened to me", "22:50", "is like on another day he wouldn't throw", "22:54", "a lucky punch like that he wouldn't hit", "22:55", "me and he wouldn't have a ref that you", "22:58", "know was on his side as well how was the", "23:00", "ref on his side um when I say the rest", "23:03", "on his side you know he called it a", "23:05", "little early oh yeah", "23:06", "I got knocked down in the second round", "23:08", "I'm the champion right at least give me", "23:11", "a chance not waive the fight strip right", "23:13", "right you know you've seen you seen the", "23:15", "Deonte like you know if that was the", "23:20", "referee counted him out straightaway", "23:22", "yeah that's what stopped it at the press", "23:24", "conference fuckin 12th round that right", "23:26", "left that Deon he landed the fact that", "23:29", "Tyson got up and then won the remainder", "23:31", "of the round that is crazy", "23:33", "yeah I am so frustrated that fight it's", "23:35", "not happening again man every you know", "23:37", "I'm looking at the heavyweight scene and", "23:40", "I'm looking at obviously Joshua Joshua", "23:45", "from England and you know he had the", "23:47", "opportunity to fight the ante and didn't", "23:49", "take it I'm like if that was me I would", "23:52", "have took that chance because you never", "23:53", "know what happens down the road likes", "23:54", "what's happening yeah", "23:56", "and you know Timmy's being put on the", "23:58", "shelf now he has to box somebody that", "24:00", "nobody

of him I don't know too much", "24:11", "about him but you know he's talks a good", "24:13", "fight I knew you I know anyway waited", "24:16", "over 300 pounds at one time Andy and", "24:18", "yeah and you know now he's got an", "24:21", "opportunity to fight Joshua so he's", "24:24", "taking full advantage of it like he", "24:25", "should but you know I don't see anything", "24:30", "in his history to show me that he can", "24:32", "beat Joshua you move you peek and he can", "24:35", "he can bang now he can bang if you dare", "24:38", "- bang - Joshua's got feet he's gonna", "24:40",

"24:49", "mean this these are one of those things", "24:50", "where I think this is where Anthony's", "24:52", "got to be extra careful because Miller's", "24:55", "gonna train twice as hard and if Joshua", "24:58", "doesn't train like he's fighting Deonte", "24:59", "right he's gonna he may take it for", "25:02", "granted make a mistake and you can do", "25:03", "that I've done that I've done
