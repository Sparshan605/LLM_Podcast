respects but in other respects the", "11:11", "what what happens you can get Oh eyes", "11:13", "audiences our audiences will become", "11:16", "catalyzed so let's say that for example", "11:17", "I I'm interested in playing computer", "11:19", "games so as a 17 year old or something", "11:22", "of you if that's what you're into you", "11:23", "can just watch that 24/7 you just did so", "11:26", "you're not exposed to new ideas so I", "11:29", "would say is that choice really the", "11:32", "choice is really what you mean is", "11:34", "informed choice so you mean well here", "11:36", "here's the spread of ideas that our", "11:38", "culture is generated over you know more", "11:40", "than 3000 years of civilization and you", "11:44", "you will stumble across things you", "11:45", "didn't

hundred thousand years ago", "11:54", "maybe you find that fascinating but if", "11:56", "you're not exposed to those ideas at all", "11:58", "and culture has no way of exposing you", "12:01", "to those ideas beyond the education", "12:03", "system then we we're in a we have a", "12:06", "problem", "12:06", "so I don't know what the solution is to", "12:08", "this but I think that there's there's a", "12:11", "there's something to be said it will", "12:13", "never come back now but the old", "12:14", "fashioned model that we had in Britain", "12:16", "for many years where the BBC was really", "12:19", "quite dominant was that you could almost", "12:21", "you could say what we're going to put X", "12:23", "Factor on let's say or Dancing with the", "12:24", "Stars or whatever that thing is and then", "12:27", "after it we're going to put a", "12:28", "documentary on about astronomy and the", "12:30", "idea is that some of that the people", "12:32", "they were watching the talent show it", "12:34", "will drift into the documentary guy I", "12:35", "didn't know I was interested in the moon", "12:38", "of Jupiter called Europa as a ocean", "12:40", "surrounding it there may have life on", "12:42", "the I didn't know that I didn't know I", "12:43", "was interested and that that model works", "12:46", "so it you're right though it's gone", "12:48", "probably so the great challenge is how", "12:50", "do you how do you expose people to new", "12:52", "ideas in our culture how do you get", "12:54", "debates going how do you stimulate that", "12:56", "kind of excitement about knowledge in", "12:59", "this new media world maybe you know", "13:01", "you're sort of an evangelist in that", "13:03", "sense then you're I don't mean in a", "13:06", "religious way

seventeen year old kid", "13:14", "who watches video games all day which", "13:16", "easily could have been me that kid will", "13:19", "never break out of that mold", "13:20", "I think that the I think the", "13:23", "seventeen-year-old kid if he watches if", "13:25", "he really is completely obsessed and he", "13:27", "wants to watch video games all day the", "13:28", "only thing is gonna fix

"access to all kinds of shit that like if", "13:49", "he was just waiting for the BBC to", "13:51", "spoon-feed him he's never gonna do yeah", "13:53", "like also I think that having the stupid", "13:56", "shows that we have here in America like", "13:58", "if you watch reality shows one of the", "14:00", "things you'll notice is the anger that", "14:02", "people have about these shows the anger", "14:05", "that they're being force-fed this", "14:07", "fucking stupid shit but they're still", "14:08", "watching it that anger sometimes that", "14:12", "that that the rejection of it almost

shit all over the place well I", "28:26", "bet every keystroke along the way and", "28:29", "there's a monkey shitting on their", "28:30", "typewriter like you get like the first", "28:31", "paragraph

say well it's because we", "33:06", "they were forced into groups so it's", "33:08", "group dynamics it's the fact that you", "33:09", "end up with bigger tribes you know", "33:11", "hundreds of

theories that", "40:34", "say well how long did that period of", "40:36", "expansion go on for and does it all stop", "40:38", "at once so does it stop in patches and", "40:41", "if it stops in

"but it's relatively mainstream at but it", "41:25", "well one of my colleagues noticed and", "41:27", "some physicists have noticed is if you", "41:29", "were some kind of omnipotent deity", "41:31", "programmer and you wanted to run what's", "41:34", "called a Monte Carlo simulation to say", "41:36", "well I'll vary the strength of gravity", "41:38", "in one universe and vary the mass of the",

just", "42:07", "have to emphasize this is way out there", "42:09", "we're on the edge but it's fun then what", "42:11", "what is fun an interesting note is that", "42:13", "the", "42:14", "why no the way back the inflationary", "42:16", "cosmology bit his is probably the most", "42:18", "widely accepted theory at the moment for", "42:21", "how the universe got to be the way it is", "42:23", "and

a sense it looks like that the", "42:42", "laws of nature were very slightly", "42:43", "different you wouldn't get carbon for", "42:45", "example produced in stars in in large", "42:48", "quantities

"explanation for why the laws of nature", "43:06", "of the way they are or you go to one of", "43:09", "these multiverse theories and say well", "43:11", "actually goes back to what we talked",

and", "43:48", "not just in fact but infinite numbers of", "43:50", "these infinite things infinite numbers", "43:52", "of infinite universe is these these", "43:56", "theories exist so this idea of computer", "43:59", "simulation the idea that the world we", "44:02", "live in the universe we live in is a", "44:04", "simulation that was the question yes", "44:05", "that's what you went on as

like what you were saying", "44:48", "that if you were going to be some", "44:50", "omnipotent deity that creates the", "44:52", "universe you'd probably do something", "44:53", "like this like every

1930s", "45:14", "they figured this out and that this", "45:17", "actually exists in these codes in string", "45:21", "theory and his idea was that that's", "45:23", "somehow another proves that there is", "45:25", "some evidence support that life the", "45:28", "reality that we see right now is a", "45:29", "simulation or it could be that which way", "45:33", "more likely that you're just discovering", "45:35", "some sort of code that the entire", "45:38", "universe is based on that when you look", "45:40", "at things being fractal and you look at", "45:42", "the idea of there being not just", "45:44", "infinite expansion but infinite", "45:46", "contraction and that there is no", "45:48", "smallest point there's just smaller than", "45:50", "we can measure but when we talk about", "45:52", "subatomic particles and we talk about", "45:54", "things being like atoms being mostly air", "45:56", "and then you go deeper and deeper and", "45:58", "you don't know what the fuck is going on", "45:59", "and particles are blinking in and out of", "46:01", "existence and existing at the same time", "46:03", "both moving and still ah could it be", "46:06", "that you just gotta keep getting we just", "46:08", "can't see it well I mean the answer is I", "46:11", "mean we saw do you know what the fuck's", "46:12", "going on it's simple you know if you", "46:16", "look to the LHC which is the Large", "46:17", "Hadron Collider which is the place where", "46:20", "we generate the highest energy so it's", "46:21", "the biggest microscope in the world in", "46:23", "us and we have an extremely good", "46:25", "understanding of the laws of physics at", "46:27", "that level and", "46:28", "up to and including the discovery of the", "46:30", "Higgs particle just as that's been", "46:32", "proven is that we made at all the higgs", "46:34", "because I remember there was some people", "46:35", "that were debating whether or not thanks", "46:37", "nerdy say bolson do you say Boston yeah", "46:39", "and boson there's a new there is a", "46:41", "particle there that we've discovered and", "46:43", "it has all the right properties to be", "46:45", "the the predicted Standard Model Higgs", "46:47", "particle it please explain what that", "46:48", "means so the Higgs particle he was", "46:50", "predicted back in the 60s my Peter Higgs", "46:52", "in others meant its name and it's a the", "46:55", "idea is basically that early on in the", "46:57", "expansion history of the universe so", "46:59", "let's say less than a billionth of a", "47:00", "second after the Big Bang as the", "47:02", "universe cooled it went through", "47:04", "something condensed out into empty space", "47:07", "so people call it a phase transition", "47:09", "away but it's analogous to a windowpane", "47:11", "on a cold winter's day to have cold", "47:13", "winters days in LA to get ice on a", "47:18", "window it's analogous to water vapor", "47:21", "condensing out into ice as you drop the", "47:23", "temperature it changes into something", "47:24", "else too into ice so in the same way", "47:26", "that the theory is that as the universe", "47:28", "cooled something condensed out so empty", "47:31", "space isn't empty", "47:31", "it's full of Higgs particles if you like", "47:34", "or a Higgs field so every bit so this", "47:37", "means this space now just face between", "47:39", "the galaxies in this room that every", "47:41", "square metre", "47:43", "over this room is full of the Higgs", "47:45", "field and our fundamental particles the", "47:48", "electrons that say in our bodies", "47:49", "interact with that Higgs field and in", "47:51", "that process they acquire mass so it's", "47:54", "the mass generation mechanism it's why", "47:57", "some particles are massive like", "47:59", "electrons and quarks and some things", "48:01", "like photons are not massive they're", "48:03", "massless and they travel through the", "48:05", "universe at the speed of light so that's", "48:07", "the theory now that was suggested and", "48:09", "built mathematically essentially there", "48:12", "was very little evidence for it at the", "48:13", "time back in 60s but over the years it", "48:16", "the theory called the standard model of", "48:18", "particle physics passed all experimental", "48:20", "tests so we got to the point where we", "48:22", "thought right okay we will build a", "48:23", "machine that will either disprove or", "48:25", "prove that theory and the LHC is such a", "48:28", "machine if that theory is correct which", "48:31", "it now seems to be it the prediction is", "48:33", "you must find the Higgs particle the LHC", "48:37", "or some kind of Higgs particle and", "48:39", "indeed we found it we as as far as we", "48:42", "can", "48:42", "so that means that we found a new", "48:43", "particle it has the right mass as", "48:45", "predicted in the window that was", "48:47", "predicted by the theory it behaves in", "48:49", "every way like the theory predicts so", "48:51", "now what we have to do is be", "48:53", "experimental physicists so the LHC turns", "48:55", "back on again in about a month actually", "48:57", "so it's been upgraded it's been fixed", "48:59", "and it's done its maintenance so we're", "49:01", "going to make more Higgs particles now", "49:02", "and that means we can make more", "49:03", "precision measurements and find out", "49:05", "whether it is the particle predicted by", "49:07", "Peter Higgs or maybe it's one of a", "49:09", "number of Higgs particles just possibly", "49:11", "likely not now it but it might be so", "49:14", "there might be five of them for example", "49:15", "which would suggest that theories call", "49:17", "supersymmetric theories all right so so", "49:19", "we need to know exactly which precisely", "49:22", "had the thing behaves which is why we", "49:24", "have more work to do but it looks like", "49:26", "very sure but very sure that it is a", "49:29", "Higgs particle that you can justyou can", "49:32", "mess around and build", "49:33", "esoteric theories that get you around it", "49:35", "but there is a new particle there", "49:37", "there's no doubt about that it looks", "49:39", "like one of these things but that's the", "49:40", "remarkable thing to think about it", "49:41", "because it was its Vigna when a great", "49:44", "physicist wrote an essay back in the", "49:46", "sixties I think all the unreasonable", "49:47", "effectiveness of mathematics and the", "49:49", "physical sciences and by the", "49:51", "unreasonable effectiveness is", "49:53", "demonstrated by this discovery because", "49:54", "it really is a mathematical prediction", "49:56", "it's like we think there's a new", "49:57",

"50:04", "look like and this is what it will do", "50:06", "and then 50 years later you build the", "50:09", "biggest machine ever built 60 miles in", "50:12", "circumference most of it's in France a", "50:14", "bit of it's in Switzerland scientists", "50:16", "hundred fifty countries you accelerate", "50:19", "protons the nuclei of hydrogen around", "50:21", "this thing 99.999999% the speed of

"50:39", "called Atlas is 40 40 meters in diameter", "50:42", "did you vast vast thing 7,000 tons of", "50:46", "digital camera in a cavern beside of", "50:48", "Simpson that simples Cathedral", "50:50", "underneath the ground in Switzerland and", "50:52", "you find it you find this link", "50:55", "this guy Peter Higgs works with many", "50:58", "other people predicted to exist 50 years", "51:00", "ago because he did some sums and so it's", "51:03", "a real such real so the universe does", "51:05", "behave like that there is a condensate", "51:07", "in the vacuum it is a Higgs condensate", "51:10", "it does give mass to do the particles it", "51:12", "so it's a tremendous testament to the", "51:15", "power of human reasoning I think and it", "51:18", "means that we understand physics it", "51:20", "means that we that's one of the", "51:21", "important things about it it means that", "51:22", "our our understanding of fundamental", "51:24", "physics is not horribly wrong at the", "51:27", "moment it's it's it's good enough to", "51:30", "predict something like that which is a", "51:31", "remarkable achievement that is", "51:33", "mind-blowing", "51:34",

it's possible if you have extra", "62:15", "dimensions in the universe right so the", "62:18", "thing is that so we need gravity is a", "62:20", "very weak force is by far the weakest of", "62:22",

two", "62:56", "of the forces so-called the", "62:58", "electromagnetism which is the most", "62:59", "familiar one electricity that one and", "63:01", "the weak nuclear force which is one of",

"63:19", "nuclear force because higher energies", "63:21", "and temperatures converges and they'd", "63:23", "have some things called grand unified", "63:24", "theories and then gravity makes its",

you", "63:35", "want so very very hard so it's a way in", "63:38", "excess of anything yes so if you just", "63:40", "want to just create black holes in a lab", "63:42", "then the naive thing is you'd have to go", "63:44", "to those energies and there's nowhere in", "63:46", "the universe you'd never do it so you'd", "63:47", "have a path to accelerate at the side of", "63:48", "the observable

"64:06", "changing their mind you know 13 now and", "64:13", "then what you can do is you can arrange", "64:16", "for that energy scale which gravity", "64:18", "becomes important to come up to the",

"68:38", "see any we don't see any evidence for", "68:39", "anything well when you see someone like", "68:41", "the people that run SETI search for", "68:43", "extraterrestrial intelligence and", "68:44", "they're always like asking for funding", "68:45", "like you know we need more funding we", "68:47", "have to figure this out and one day what", "68:49", "if we shut down and the signal comes", "68:51", "like that seems to me to be like one of", "68:53", "the biggest like Hail Mary wishes like", "68:56", "hoping that you're gonna find a radio", "68:58", "signal from a galaxy far far

probably yes I suspect I", "69:43", "suspect well we may find life on Mars in", "69:45", "the next 10 years but it'll be microbes", "69:47", "so the question then becomes well how", "69:49", "likely

because I don't understand string", "77:18", "theory know I don't know but I", "77:19", "understand what you're saying", "77:21", "but but you're right but my idea is if", "77:24", "we continue to go

and time of space-time thank God", "78:00", "for Einstein so that is its birth", "78:07", "amazing and so the speed of light as a", "78:11", "as a fundamental part of the structure", "78:15", "of space and time actually is central to", "78:17", "that theory it's actually the thing that", "78:19", "protects cause and effect so it protects", "78:23", "if you like the past from the present", "78:25", "and the future so it's built in a very", "78:28", "fundamental way to that theory so you", "78:31", "are right it's in principle that and", "78:33", "it's a speed limit in that theory by the", "78:35", "way and by the way there's strange", "78:37", "things happen as you approach the speed", "78:38", "of light for example the theory says", "78:40", "that time slows down right thing that's", "78:43", "traveling relative to us so if someone", "78:45", "the number I know is the number for the", "78:47", "protons in the LHC so the protons go", "78:50", "99.999999% the speed of light let's so", "78:53", "imagine one of those flying pastors now", "78:54", "and you imagine how to watch Frode son", "78:57", "with a watch and you'd see its watch", "78:59", "past seven thousand times

can so", "79:13", "you can move through time at different", "79:16", "rates essentially United Stein's theory", "79:18", "that the faster you go relative to", "79:20", "somebody else the slower your watch", "79:21", "ticks I got an idea we combine your", "79:24", "world and the Kardashians and we shoot", "79:26", "them in a space of the speed of light", "79:28", "and they don't age well that's exactly", "79:30", "right so exactly the cool thing about", "79:32", "that that's what I was going to so the", "79:34", "visit by trellis", "79:34", "it is if you go at the speed of light", "79:37", "you don't age no time passes the the", "79:41", "it's kind of pointed that you can't go", "79:43", "at the speed of light unless you're", "79:44", "massless but that's kind of tell but if", "79:47", "you mess that you have to move your ass", "79:49", "good luck making that thing massless", "79:50", "well exactly so she would be limited to", "79:53", "travel below the speed of light even if", "79:57", "she only if she lives only 1 gram in", "80:00", "mass Plus that's not a very aerodynamic", "80:04", "object either launching that sucker oh", "80:08", "that's right wouldn't matter in space", "80:09", "because it's a vacuum right so it's a", "80:15", "fundamental thing so it's so if you if", "80:17", "you're going at that fundamental speed", "80:19", "there's no time there's no distance", "80:21", "actually there all the distance is", "80:23", "shrink to zero so it's it's a web", "80:25", "tracee's it's a fundamental part of the", "80:27", "structure of space and time so it's been", "80:29", "possible so you would need a different", "80:31", "theory so it's literally impossible in", "80:33", "Einstein's theory to go at the speed of", "80:35", "light unless your mess less could you go", "80:40", "just under the speed of light and then", "80:42", "time would just slow down yes so it", "80:44", "wouldn't you wouldn't it wouldn't stop", "80:46", "but it would slow drastically yeah yeah", "80:49", "so as I said 99.999999% gives you a", "80:53", "factor of 7,000 now here's the question", "80:55", "if you somehow or another were able to", "80:58", "go 99.999% of speed of light what would", "81:02", "happen in your perspective as far as", "81:05", "time would with time normal rates at a", "81:08", "normal rate yeah so you would age at a", "81:10", "normal rate in your perspective but back", "81:13", "home like if you came back around he", "81:15", "went out into space and you went 10", "81:17", "years at the speed of light and you know", "81:19", "you came back everything it would change", "81:22", "but you'd be exactly the same yes what", "81:24", "would change for you though something", "81:26", "has to change so it's the distances so", "81:29", "if you travel so the other thing is from", "81:32", "the put let's talk about the protons in", "81:33", "the LHC again so they're times passing", "81:36", "7,000 times more slowly from the", "81:38", "perspective if someone stood on the", "81:39", "ground watching them go round but from", "81:42", "their perspective times gone at the same", "81:43", "rate but something must change so what", "81:46", "is it it's a distance so the LHC", "81:48", "no longer 16 miles in circumference it's", "81:52", "about now I know the number in metric so", "81:55", "it's 4 meters so that's sir what is that", "81:57", "in 3 feet wealth in the meter it's like", "81:59", "3.5 feet 12 feet yes so it's 12 feet so", "82:03", "it's it's squashes and so distance is", "82:05", "shrink from the perspective of the", "82:07", "protons so time passes at the same rate", "82:09", "that the normal rate for them for non", "82:12", "their watch but the distances seems to", "82:14", "seem to shrink or do shrink not seem to", "82:17", "they do the are you concerned at all", "82:20", "about artificial life are you concerned", "82:23", "at all about the creation the inevitable", "82:27", "creation of something that in some way", "82:31", "replicates independent thought and acts", "82:34", "on its own accord I always wonder if", "82:37", "human beings are in some sort of a sense", "82:40", "a technological

"84:47", "great things to it but I agree I agree", "84:49", "with you I don't see any reason why a AI", "84:52", "is is in principle not possible", "84:55", "III because I think that although you", "85:00", "know the research we don't understand", "85:01", "the brain but I think it must must be an", "85:04", "object that operates in accord with the", "85:06", "laws of physics yeah I strongly suspect", "85:09", "that our conscious experience is", "85:11", "emergent so it emerges so there's a", "85:13", "there's an algorithm they're very", "85:15", "complex algorithm but I don't see why it", "85:17", "can't be simulated in a sufficiently", "85:19", "powerful computer in principle so I", "85:21", "don't see why you can't have a conscious", "85:23", "computer I I don't personally see why", "85:25", "you can't", "85:26", "therefore if that's true then you can", "85:29", "given and as you say the rate of", "85:32", "increase in computing power is is rapid", "85:33", "we're not there yet there is a project", "85:36", "in Europe a very big project to build a", "85:39", "brain simulator it's a long way off and", "85:42", "you're talking about billions of dollars", "85:43", "but and at the moment you know as you", "85:46", "say that 40 years ago a billion dollars", "85:49", "wouldn't you bought you an iPhone come", "85:50", "right but so so yeah I I agree with you", "85:53", "and actually and as you said 3d printers", "85:57", "essentially seemed to be the first step", "85:59", "on the road to a self-replicating", "86:01", "machine so you've got the computing", "86:03", "power that can be intelligent and you've", "86:05", "got a means of it being a replicator", "86:07", "then I don't see why you can't build a", "86:10", "eyes that replicate and actually going", "86:13",

that they would have done that and", "86:24", "this is an argument from a mathematician", "86:26", "called von Neumann and also a physicist", "86:29", "called Fermi it's called the Fermi", "86:30",

we have built self-replicating ai's", "86:47", "yeah unless there's some reason in", "86:49", "principle why you can't so what do you", "86:51", "do you send those out there replicators", "86:54", "they can go to asteroids mine print 3d", "86:56", "print of version themselves go off again", "86:58", "they exponentiate they can crawl over", "87:02", "the galaxy exploring for free you send",

principle", "87:13", "that stops you doing it so actually", "87:15", "there is something special about", "87:17", "intelligence and you just can't with", "87:19", "some reason why you can't build a", "87:20", "computer that's that artificially", "87:22", "intelligent I don't see why that would", "87:24", "be the case oh you could argue you can't", "87:26", "build a self-replicate but you can", "87:27", "because we are we're replicators and we", "87:29", "operate in accord with the laws of", "87:31", "physics so there so there's a replicator", "87:32", "or the reason we don't see them is", "87:36", "because there aren't any civilizations", "87:37", "that ever got to that level in the Milky", "87:39", "Way so well that's beer no one what we", "87:42", "can't we couldn't be the third it's
