replace the entire", "116:57", "motherboard and he's like that is so", "117:00", "irresponsible yeah and it's like the", "117:02", "only reason why this exists is because", "117:04", "people allow Apple to do it", "117:05", "things like any other company whether", "117:07", "it's IBM or over Lenovo or fucking Dell", "117:10", "when you buy a laptop from them you", "117:13", "there's all these

that you have to carry a different", "118:02", "K and then you're like does this fit", "118:04", "that and then you know then yeah it's", "118:07", "painting it the only thing that Apple", "118:08", "has going for it is privacy in terms of", "118:10", "phones they are way better with the", "118:12", "privacy but because of that privacy and", "118:16", "protecting your privacy that's also why",
