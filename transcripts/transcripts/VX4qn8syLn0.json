at you and go", "52:35", "mad and shit and they'll go back to", "52:37", "eating unless you're close but let's", "52:40", "smell you like fuck yeah yeah especially", "52:43", "that real tree stuff I see these days", "52:45", "looks so authentic like yeah that's not", "52:48", "the stuff that works the best it's not", "52:50", "interesting no authentic is not what", "52:52", "works the best what works the best is", "52:53", "like there's there's a bunch of", "52:56", "different companies that make like", "52:57", "really good camo but the secret behind", "52:59", "it is just breaking up the outline", "53:01", "doesn't have to look like anything it's", "53:03", "just a matter of like breaking it up", "53:05", "with like blotches and spots and there's", "53:07", "a couple companies like Under Armour", "53:09", "actually has a really good pattern it's", "53:10", "called Ridge Reaper Ridge Reaper baron", "53:12", "and that pattern is really good Sitka is", "53:14", "probably the best pattern they have a", "53:16", "pattern called a sub Alpine open country", "53:20", "subalpine I think it's wrong but it's uh", "53:22", "it's just a bunch of dots and splotches", "53:26", "the whole idea is just to break up your", "53:28", "your outline so when someone looks at", "53:30", "you or an animal looks at you they don't", "53:32", "know what the fuck they're saying so the", "53:34", "idea is that this hex suit somehow or", "53:36", "another it blocks out your electrical", "53:39", "output whatever that frequency is that", "53:42", "these animals can see and it's it's not", "53:45", "proven it's it's real weird stuff it's", "53:47", "like we know that there's something that", "53:49", "gives off like these hex companies that", "53:51", "they've that that one company they have", "53:53", "this machine they'll show you their what", "53:55", "you wave your hand over this thing", "53:56", "without a heck suit on and it registers", "53:58", "this electrical frequency and then you", "54:00", "wave it with the hex suit on it", "54:02", "registers nothing but if they smell you", "54:05", "you're still fucked like yeah but anyway", "54:06", "these birds", "54:07", "somehow or another they're all giving", "54:10", "off a frequency so when they're doing", "54:12", "that crazy wave and their flight they're", "54:15", "flying right so they're beating their", "54:17", "wings together like a bunch of fucking", "54:19", "helicopters but they're not touching", "54:20", "right", "54:21", "they're just floating back and forth", "54:23", "somehow and somehow it works it's it's", "54:26", "got to be inches apart inches yeah", "54:28", "inches I mean there's these huge", "54:31", "migrations of birds that are flying", "54:33", "through the air and they move like fish", "54:35", "in the ocean the same sort of thing", "54:37", "right and they say that's how fish do it", "54:39", "to that they have this frequency that", "54:41", "they're all giving off and some somehow", "54:43", "or another they all know how to move in", "54:45", "tandem like no one's fuck there's no", "54:52", "straggler either like one guy off to the", "54:54", "fucking side it's weird", "54:56", "I don't I don't understand it but people", "54:58", "are trying to capitalize on whatever", "55:00", "that is or hide mask whatever frequency", "55:03", "we give off so the idea is that we don't", "55:05", "really totally understand animal senses", "55:08", "we've done a bunch of tests on deer they", "55:11", "know they're colorblind they don't see", "55:13", "necessarily greens

very recognizable when they", "55:26", "smell pretty good but they don't smell", "55:28", "nearly as good as something like bears", "55:29", "apparently one of the best at like using", "55:32", "their nose mm-hmm bears smell anything", "55:35", "like bears can smell a dead animal miles", "55:38", "or miles miles away you know that would", "55:41", "make me nervous if I saw a dead animal", "55:43",

"57:32", "like their sense of smell is so powerful", "57:35", "that it's almost impossible to mask it", "57:37", "unless you use ozone and so what a lot", "57:40", "of guys do is there's a company called", "57:42", "o's onyx and what they do is they'll", "57:44", "literally hang a unit above their head", "57:47", "and it blows ozone gas all over your", "57:51", "body and it collects like your scent", "57:54", "gets combined with the ozone and that", "57:57", "hits the deer and the deer doesn't know", "57:59", "what the fuck you are huh it's like what", "58:02", "is that smell it's just if

hour and the", "58:20", "ozone dissipates but it's got a very", "58:23", "distinct smell and apparently that smell", "58:26", "just overwhelms the smell of human body", "58:29", "so when guys sit on the tree stand like", "58:31", "I've I've hunted with my friend John", "58:33", "Dudley in Iowa and he uses this oz onyx", "58:36", "unit above us he sets it out it's there", "58:39", "on the tree above us and turns it on and", "58:41", "blows ozone over you while you're", "58:43", "sitting in a tree so even if a deer's", "58:45", "downwind of you", "58:46", "they might not bolt because this
