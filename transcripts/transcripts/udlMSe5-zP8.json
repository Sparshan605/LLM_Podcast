Washington", "00:11", "you're up there so this is great people", "00:13", "have been kind of nudging us from years", "00:15", "and years to get this done so it's great", "00:17", "that we're finally able to make it", "00:18", "happen yeah I'm I have been from day one", "00:22", "a gigantic quake junkie and a doom", "00:24", "junkie so for me to have you in here is", "00:27", "a giant treat and everybody you know", "00:28", "I've talked about your video games and", "00:30", "your creation so many times on this", "00:32", "podcast so it's it's very cool to have", "00:34", "you here and thank you very much for", "00:35", "showing me before the podcast got", "00:37", "started I should tell everybody you", "00:39", "showed me the latest and greatest", "00:40", "version of oculus rift which is amazing", "00:43", "it's so small for people watching the", "00:45", "YouTube this is the entire unit this", "00:47", "this thing that sits on your head it's", "00:49", "very light and it's not attached to a", "00:52", "computer like you don't have to carry", "00:54", "anything around and there's no extra", "00:55", "everything is in here yeah so this is", "00:57", "the oculus quest the standalone device", "00:59", "and it's been kind of the culmination of", "01:02", "a bunch of different products that we've", "01:03", "been working on and it's the vision that", "01:05", "we had even six years ago just the idea", "01:07", "of not connected to anything you put", "01:09", "this magic hat on and you're transported", "01:12", "to these different worlds and this is", "01:14", "available right now anyone can buy this", "01:16", "right yeah okay so it's about the change", "01:17", "is actually pulled up the website push", "01:20", "this up to you how what is the battery", "01:24", "left on these things so depends on what", "01:26", "you're doing where I just sit there and", "01:28", "watch Netflix I you know it'll last a", "01:30", "little more than three hours if you play", "01:32", "some of the really hardcore games it", "01:34", "might only last two hours or so do you", "01:36", "have numbers on how many people are", "01:37", "watching Netflix on this thing so our", "01:39", "previous one right before this the", "01:41", "oculus go was a little bit more media", "01:43", "focused and that's one of our more", "01:45", "popular applications I mean surprisingly", "01:47", "things everybody thought that VR was", "01:49", "going to be all about these just amazing", "01:51", "gaming experiences but some of the most", "01:53", "popular experiences are doing reasonably", "01:55", "conventional things watching Netflix", "01:57", "watching YouTube Amazon Prime stuff like", "02:00", "that", "02:00", "where if you're like if you're you and", "02:03", "you've got a great home theater and", "02:04", "everything there's not this much benefit", "02:06", "to having a theater like that in VR but", "02:09", "if you're in a situation like you're in", "02:10", "a tiny room in Tokyo or something", "02:13", "the idea of being able to put on the VR", "02:15", "headset and have this like lovely ski", "02:18", "lodge atmosphere with a giant screen TV", "02:20", "it has some real benefits so in the end", "02:23", "VR should be a replacement for anything", "02:26", "you do on screens today whether it's", "02:28", "your phone your tablet your TV your", "02:30", "laptop your PC all of these should", "02:33", "eventually be superseded by just having", "02:35", "more flexible screens in VR and we have", "02:38", "lots of challenges now with resolution", "02:39", "and comfort for long term use but this", "02:42", "is the direction that everything's going", "02:43", "not only do you have things in VR that", "02:45", "you couldn't do anywhere else just", "02:47", "experiences that you can't have with", "02:49", "that level of immersion but it should", "02:51", "pull along every other thing that people", "02:53", "do with screens devices today that's I", "02:56", "didn't consider the television shows but", "02:58", "of course people would be watching", "03:00", "Netflix on this if it's possible have", "03:02", "you done the Disney World ride the", "03:05", "Avatar ride flights of passage now I", "03:07", "haven't done that yet it's amazing you", "03:10", "sit on this it's like a motorcycle", "03:12", "looking thing it straps you in place and", "03:14", "it's supposed to represent one of those", "03:16", "flying dragon things in Avatar and then", "03:18", "you have the headset you put that on and", "03:20", "the virtual reality experience is second", "03:23", "to none I mean it's incredible", "03:25", "super-high resolution and the motorcycle", "03:27", "is moving around you get wind and smells", "03:30", "and all these sensors yeah so that's one", "03:32", "of the really interesting things like I", "03:33", "think about that whenever I am at", "03:35", "amusement parks for things like the", "03:36", "Harry Potter rides and stuff like that", "03:38", "where they're doing lots with screens", "03:39", "and motion platforms where I think about", "03:43", "it from the VR perspective and anything", "03:44", "we're doing visually and audibly we", "03:46", "could go ahead and do a great job in the", "03:48", "headset so it's cutting it down to these", "03:50", "few physical things that you can't do so", "03:52", "you've got things with motion platforms", "03:54", "that actually jostle you around that you", "03:56", "can't do in VR you've got things like", "03:58", "smell and like the void I am where they", "04:01", "have the Star Wars experience there we", "04:03", "have a fantastic Star Wars experience on", "04:05", "quest which in many ways has a lot of", "04:08", "that magic but in the void where they", "04:10", "set it up and they blow hot air over", "04:11", "what's the virtual lava yeah", "04:13", "towards you that's something that you", "04:15", "still don't get but it's kind of like", "04:17", "the age-old battle of what can you do", "04:20", "differently in an arcade that you can't", "04:21", "do as good in your your home system and", "04:24", "VR now takes lets you

throw some of", "04:33", "these extra things and people joke about", "04:35", "when is smell-a-vision coming to VR and", "04:38", "there have actually been real companies", "04:40", "that have spun up to say it's like well", "04:42", "we want to do scent augmentation it's", "04:45", "not a great thing and those are still", "04:47", "the last vestiges of things where you", "04:49", "have to go someplace but the promise of", "04:51", "VR is to you know the world as you want", "04:53", "it not having to go to someplace to do", "04:55", "something magical and if you can get to", "04:57", "90 something percent of that experience", "04:59", "staying in your own room then that's", "05:02", "great what would they be able to do with", "05:03", "smellivision would you have like a", "05:04", "standalone unit that like has access to", "05:08", "the program so like if you were flying", "05:10", "over orange fields it would spray citrus", "05:13", "in the air so sort of like soaring over", "05:15", "the world have you ever done that", "05:16", "Disneyland rocket so somebody literally", "05:19", "did make this where they made a little", "05:20", "box that put that glue to attach to the", "05:23", "underside of the head-mounted display", "05:24", "and one of the interesting things about", "05:26", "sent as opposed to I like audio or video", "05:29", "with video everybody knows that you just", "05:31", "make red green and blue colors you can", "05:33", "mix them in any way and make all the", "05:35", "colors that we can see smell isn't like", "05:37", "that", "05:38", "I am our nose is actually a receptor for", "05:40", "a whole lot of discrete different", "05:42", "molecules there's no way to mix up smell", "05:45", "like the way we do with light to make", "05:46", "red green and blue primaries with that", "05:48", "so they really had to pick okay here's", "05:51", "the dozen or so smells that we're going", "05:52", "to have with this and it would just sort", "05:54", "of spritz it out on a little blast of", "05:56", "air I very close to your nose so it", "05:58", "doesn't need much of it to get in", "06:00", "hmm so if you really wanted to do some", "06:03", "sort of a jungle experience with you", "06:05", "know thousands of different smells of", "06:07", "plants and dirt and although you would", "06:09", "have to have like some enormous unit", "06:11", "that's spraying these various things", "06:13", "yeah although I suspect that at least", "06:15", "modern people in modern society do not", "06:18", "really have that discerning of a level", "06:20", "of scent like if you took I some", "06:22", "Peruvian indigent or something that they", "06:24", "probably would complain it's like oh the", "06:26", "fidelity on this is garbage I should", "06:27", "have 500 different smells here and I", "06:29", "only detect five right but you take you", "06:32", "know a normal City person and you just", "06:34", "three scents of jungle is probably going", "06:36", "to be", "06:36", "more than enough to sell the experience", "06:38", "yeah the guy in the jungle bill this is", "06:40", "sterile urine yes not real so what is", "06:43", "this Jamie so this is something she's", "06:48", "holding I know I get it she's pulled it", "06:50", "off it attaches to the head sorry", "06:52", "it says feel real yeah sensory mask so", "06:56", "it's a sensory mask that smell virtual", "06:59", "reality oh yeah and so it simulates", "07:02", "simulates hundreds of smells to immerse", "07:04", "you in the virtual world Wow", "07:07", "of course it's coming but why am i", "07:09", "shocked look at this guy's got like a", "07:11", "little cartridge just pop it in there", "07:13", "all the refilling your toner cartridge", "07:15", "on reliable scent generator how", "07:19", "hilarious but yes if you have to if you", "07:21", "have to rank your senses it's not in the", "07:24", "top two yeah it's probably gonna be", "07:26", "clunky like the earlier versions of VR", "07:30", "where you got that low resolution sort", "07:32", "of thing I remember my friend Duncan", "07:34", "he's he's a huge technology freak and he", "07:37", "had a really early version of the", "07:40", "consumer virtual reality headsets the", "07:43", "early early oculus and I remember", "07:45", "putting it on going oh my god even", "07:46", "though it's really pixelated like this", "07:48", "is a game-changer it that sense that", "07:50", "you've seen the future yeah you put it", "07:52", "on it's like it's not here yet but", "07:54", "that's the the ability to just project a", "07:56", "little bit past the flaws there and say", "07:58", "okay well we're gonna sort this out over", "08:00", "the next several years", "08:01", "we'll get higher resolution we'll get", "08:03", "the response better and you can imagine", "08:05", "what it's going to be yeah it's pretty", "08:07", "stunning and what you just showed me", "08:09", "today the the Star Wars one is actually", "08:11", "higher resolution than the void which is", "08:14", "the one that you pay to go see or you go", "08:16", "into the warehouse and everything I've", "08:17", "done that several times the void with", "08:19", "Star Wars and then the void with", "08:21", "wreck-it Ralph which is pretty cool too", "08:23", "it's really fun but the physicality of", "08:25", "having the actual props there the magic", "08:27", "of being in there it's like you pull out", "08:28", "your stormtrooper blaster and you helped", "08:30", "it around and that's really something", "08:32", "versus a lot of times when you're just", "08:34", "using the controllers to pretend you're", "08:36", "doing things you feel like you're a mime", "08:38", "some place some French mime kind of", "08:40", "pretending to do things and that doesn't", "08:42", "sell the experience and that's why I", "08:44", "have you know my favorites are the", "08:45", "things like beat Sabre we're in the game", "08:48", "you are swinging this lightsaber is sort", "08:50", "of thing", "08:50", "through things so your actions in", "08:52", "reality are exactly what your actions in", "08:54", "the virtual world are you swing through", "08:57", "it there's a little bit of a buzz as you", "08:59", "cross through it and it just feels like", "09:01", "you are you're projecting yourself there", "09:03", "now what about the possibility of a", "09:05", "haptic feedback vest or a suit or", "09:08", "something you could put on your body so", "09:10", "there's the interesting things all the", "09:11", "way back into the the doom and quake", "09:13", "days I remember one of the really early", "09:14", "I have kind of entrepreneur guys that", "09:17", "came by he had made this leather jacket", "09:19", "with all these impact pucks on it and it", "09:22", "had I had like eight or nine different", "09:25", "things that were these solenoids that", "09:26", "could deliver a pretty sharp thud and he", "09:29", "wanted to you know get eye support added", "09:32", "to the games for that the idea you play", "09:34", "that and what you're getting when you're", "09:35", "getting shot it actually feels like", "09:36", "you're getting hit in the back mmm and", "09:38", "you know I didn't think that was a very", "09:40", "likely I am mass-market consumer thing I", "09:44", "mean not too many people want that level", "09:45", "of fidelity where it actually starts", "09:47", "making you sore but that's one of the", "09:50", "wonderful things about being able to", "09:51", "open-source the various codes after the", "09:53", "games are a little bit older where", "09:55", "anybody that wants to can nowadays go", "09:57", "and take doom or quake or those earlier", "10:00", "titles and program in for whatever crazy", "10:02", "thing they don't have to convince", "10:04", "someone they don't have to go convince", "10:05", "skeptical John Carmack that this device", "10:07", "is going to be a worthwhile thing to add", "10:09", "support to the main line code they can", "10:11", "just go do it which is a wonderful thing", "10:13", "that is very cool that you guys do that", "10:15", "I think that's really cool and yeah this", "10:17", "is one of those things where early on as", "10:19", "you can imagine that was a tough sell in", "10:21", "the company where the people that", "10:23", "weren't coming from the sort of hacker", "10:25", "ethic background on the programming side", "10:27", "you get the business people and the", "10:29", "artists and the designers and they're", "10:31", "like we want to just give away our", "10:32", "source code won't that be a leg up to", "10:34", "the competitors why do you want to do", "10:36", "this and it was one of my I made me", "10:39", "really happy when many years later Kevin", "10:41", "cloud one of my early partners I told me", "10:44", "that yeah in retrospect that was really", "10:45", "the right thing to do and it's great", "10:48", "with doom and quake now especially doom", "10:50", "where anything that has a processor runs", "10:52", "doom if it's got a 32-bit processor and", "10:54", "it can conceivably display an image", "10:56", "people have ported doom to it and that", "10:58", "code will live forever a hundred years", "11:00", "from now people will be able to dig up", "11:02", "and run the doom source code and", "11:04", "emulator that is very cool now what was", "11:06", "the conversation like like when you guys", "11:08", "when you were saying hey this is good", "11:10", "for the community this is good for games", "11:12", "overall it's gonna get people excited", "11:14", "about it's just gonna generate more", "11:15", "business like what did you how did you", "11:17", "sell it so it's an interesting path", "11:19", "there where in our earliest games I can", "11:22", "remember that some of the very first", "11:23", "things that happened with Wolfenstein 3d", "11:26", "before doom where that was not set up to", "11:29", "be easy to be modified we were still", "11:31", "back in those days of fitting on floppy", "11:33", "disks so I had all the data compressed", "11:35", "in this non-standard thing that I just", "11:36", "made up at the time but people dug", "11:39", "through all of that disassembled the", "11:41", "code figured out how it worked and", "11:42", "started making some level editors and", "11:45", "doing the things like you know replacing", "11:47", "Hitler with Barney and all these early", "11:49", "mods and we're all like well this is", "11:51", "fantastic you know this is people taking", "11:53", "the game they played through the game", "11:54", "they loved it and they loved it so much", "11:56", "they want to keep doing things on it and", "11:58", "they wind up breaking into the game at", "12:01", "that time essentially to figure out how", "12:03", "to make new things so by the time we", "12:04", "were working on doom it was an explicit", "12:06", "top-line technical goal for me that okay", "12:09", "I had these graphics things I wanted to", "12:10", "do I want to do networking but I also", "12:12", "wanted to really make game modding a", "12:14", "first top-level feature so we added all", "12:17", "this ability to do though the wads and P", "12:19", "wads and we documented all of it and we", "12:22", "released a lot of the tools the early", "12:24", "source code so here's how you go ahead", "12:26", "and is much harder at that point with", "12:28", "the more sophisticated stuff going on", "12:29", "but here's how you build a level in Doom", "12:31", "and we even released the code for our", "12:32", "level editor although that didn't help", "12:34", "the community that much because we were", "12:36", "using these crazy expensive next", "12:38", "workstations and other people had to", "12:40", "take the steps to go ahead and make them", "12:41", "run on PCs but the step beyond that when", "12:45", "we were looking at quake I am so I knew", "12:48", "that I wanted to enable actual changes", "12:50", "of the gameplay because in doing me you", "12:52", "could swap out all the different models", "12:53", "you could swap out I the way things look", "12:56", "the way things sounded and some people", "12:59", "would go in and actually patch the", "13:00", "executable to do a few minor changes in", "13:03", "gameplay but the next step clearly was", "13:05", "allowing people to really make whole new", "13:07", "gameplay modes so that was how quake got", "13:10", "this quake C extension language and we", "13:12", "wrote a lot of the game in that and that", "13:14", "led to all the things like capture the", "13:16", "flag and", "13:17", "forretress and all those which was arena", "13:19", "yeah all these really really great", "13:21", "things but there were still things that", "13:23", "you couldn't do or couldn't do", "13:24", "effectively there and that's where there", "13:27", "was still this desire to be able to say", "13:29", "well what if we just gave them", "13:30", "everything what if we gave them the full", "13:31", "source code and let them sort of hack to", "13:34", "their heart's content port to other", "13:35", "platforms and again it wasn't a super", "13:38", "popular decision but the way I was", "13:40", "pitching it was well it still helps our", "13:42", "titles it still gives them life it gives", "13:44", "them life after they would have been off", "13:47", "the shelf falling off of people's radar", "13:49", "just falling into some game of nostalgia", "13:51", "but being able to let people make real", "13:54", "new versions of it would be you know it", "13:57", "would keep them current it would keep", "13:58", "them relevant and so the pitch that I", "14:00", "ran for years there was after our new", "14:03", "game came out with brand new technology", "14:04", "then we should be able to open source", "14:07", "release the previous generation so first", "14:10", "when doom was out we released", "14:11", "Wolfenstein when quake was out we", "14:13", "released doom and when the later quakes", "14:15", "were out we released the quake 1 code", "14:17", "and that worked out really remarkably", "14:20", "well I know at the time there were some", "14:22", "people in the company that are just like", "14:23", "this is just John's thing and they were", "14:25", "not really happy about it but I I was in", "14:29", "a position where I could kind of throw", "14:30", "my weight around a little bit that and I", "14:32", "was happy that I did it and in the end", "14:34", "everybody agrees it was a good win I'm a", "14:37", "little sad that more companies weren't", "14:39", "able to take that final step modding was", "14:42", "embraced broadly by a lot of game", "14:43", "companies but only a handful of", "14:45", "companies were able to really go the", "14:47", "entire way and release full source code", "14:49", "in your sense that's too bad because", "14:52", "that is one of the cooler aspects of the", "14:54", "quake community is that you know you", "14:57", "guys did release that stuff and there", "14:58", "were all those cool extras and things", "15:01", "you could download in maps so many", "15:03", "different maps that people had created", "15:05", "that were really interesting like I", "15:06", "remember one was a guy's apartment like", "15:08", "you could you could play quake in an", "15:10", "apartment like you could shoot you could", "15:12", "get to the top of the toilet and shoot", "15:14", "it things off the toilet it was really", "15:15", "amazing how did you feel about when", "15:19", "people would play the game competitively", "15:20", "and they would turn all the textures off", "15:23", "so I yeah that's that especially as a", "15:27", "sore point with the artists that have", "15:28", "labored for years to build these", "15:30", "glorious", "15:31", "and then you get the people that just", "15:33", "turn them down and there's two reasons", "15:34", "to turn them down you turn them down to", "15:37", "help performance in some cases in the", "15:38", "early days and especially the early", "15:40", "graphics cards you would get higher", "15:42", "framerate if you turned him down so", "15:43", "you'd have less latency in your response", "15:45", "times but there's also the even more de",

they", "22:40", "have to be careful to make sure that", "22:42", "they've got something that has a broad", "22:43", "mass appeal and I think that is the the", "22:47", "upside of some of the older

where the mega armor is and", "23:23", "you had to know where these things were", "23:25", "and that they would regenerate every X", "23:27", "amount of seconds and so you're managing", "23:30", "not

incredible game", "23:45", "of strategy as well as like fast twitch", "23:49", "aiming and there's so many factors going", "23:51", "and the masters would have at times such", "23:53", "that they're just running to where it's", "23:55", "gonna spawn and a half second before", "23:57", "they get there it responds they run over", "23:59", "it it's theirs and it's gone and the", "24:01", "difference

with it", "28:23", "so what you're saying in terms of the", "28:25", "inner ear and the visual but what you're", "28:29", "taking individually is that when those", "28:31", "things are off your brain thinks maybe", "28:33", "you consume poison and that's why", "28:35", "they're off yeah that's one of the", "28:37", "theories because it makes your stomach", "28:38", "upset and people do throw up sometimes", "28:41", "yeah then I if you people used to do", "28:44", "that even just with traditional video", "28:45", "games where I remember in the early days", "28:47", "I in the early days of quake and dooms", "28:49", "some people would be staring intently", "28:51", "enough at the", "28:51", "screen and they would get that sense", "28:54", "where on a small monitor it's usually", "28:55", "not a problem because I am usually you", "28:59", "see the rest of the stable world around", "29:01", "you and the field of view that you pick", "29:03", "like traditionally we used about a", "29:04", "ninety degree field of view in the old", "29:06", "days and if you have a little monitor", "29:07", "here it's really only taking maybe", "29:09", "twenty five degrees or so of your field", "29:11", "of view so your brain doesn't really buy", "29:13", "it as I'm looking into a window in this", "29:15", "other world you're still kind of", "29:17", "controlling something and driving it", "29:18", "around but when you get a giant screen", "29:20", "and you get the field of view about", "29:22", "right then your brain starts picking up", "29:24", "and saying oh maybe I should be paying", "29:25", "attention to this visuals and that could", "29:27", "cause some people to have I you know get", "29:29", "simulator sickness even on the screen", "29:31", "but in VR where it's covering your", "29:33", "entire field of view and you don't have", "29:35", "a stable reference it can be a much", "29:37", "bigger problem so we we have some of", "29:39", "these band-aids where people start would", "29:41", "put cages of things in virtual reality", "29:42", "so you've at least got something stable", "29:44", "to look at and that helps a little bit", "29:46", "like there's a a game called omega agent", "29:49", "where you're flying around in a jet pack", "29:50", "and on the one hand this is the worst", "29:52", "thing to do in VR parabolic flight and", "29:54",

well it's so", "59:34", "fascinating being on the outside", "59:35", "watching all this stuff come to fruition", "59:38", "because I remember when virtual reality", "59:41", "was sort of it was something that was", "59:43", "tossed around in the 80s and we talked", "59:46", "about the future and that was one of the", "59:48", "things that people were really concerned", "59:49", "about or

every game from Wolfenstein", "60:00", "doom and quake", "60:01", "we had at least one vr entrepreneur that", "60:03", "wanted to work with us I because finally", "60:06", "here was content because

didn't have this", "60:15", "concrete instantiation of like well what", "60:18", "do you actually do and then people saw", "60:20", "the 3d games like oh that's what you", "60:22", "want to do inside the virtual reality", "60:23", "helmet so they would come up and they'd", "60:26", "want to basically work with us licensed", "60:28", "the technology and every time I looked", "60:30", "at these and like oh this it just isn't", "60:32", "gonna work out I in many cases they were", "60:34", "people that were very they were high on", "60:37", "enthusiasm but a little low on the raw", "60:39", "technical necessities to make something", "60:42", "like this happen because really it was", "60:43", "too early I mean there were systems that", "60:46", "if you had unlimited money you could get",

"61:55", "thought okay I had just finished and", "61:57", "finished rage the last game that I had", "61:59", "worked on there and and I was like all", "62:01", "right between each project I would do", "62:02", "research I would take a time to go ahead", "62:04", "and explore some new technology whether", "62:07", "it was in the game rendering or", "62:08", "something related to it and I thought",

that unless you", "96:27", "had some sort of a working dummy that", "96:29", "was programmed that I think could be", "96:31", "possible yeah I actually made a pitch", "96:33", "that what I would like

early", "98:10", "days of exploring that for making a", "98:12", "difference where people's training yeah", "98:14", "I think sparring you could have", "98:16", "something that would throw strikes

our big eye kind of convention", "101:04", "which is next in the new ones next month", "101:06", "here but we had a large area set up and", "101:09", "you had this game called dead and buried",

"101:25", "hard work to turn it real but this", "101:27", "warehouse scale stuff there are a number", "101:29", "of companies that are trying to do this", "101:30", "with various bits of technology yeah", "101:33", "just pulled something yeah that idea of", "101:35", "that was I you know where you could set", "101:38", "up people are crouching behind real", "101:39", "things in their virtual headset this is", "101:41", "all kind of zombie western themed stuff", "101:43", "and they can put their hand on real", "101:45", "things there they can move around draw a", "101:47", "bead on people and then you've got", "101:49", "another person there what with a tablet", "101:50", "which is a window into the virtual world", "101:52", "so they could look at that and see the", "101:54", "whole the way it's all drawn in style", "101:57", "the way the people are rendered inside", "101:58", "it so there is yeah this is again the", "102:01", "amazing stuff you can do outside of your", "102:03",

"dedicated play space and yeah this is", "102:12", "people not moving around too much it's", "102:14", "mostly kind of a cover based thing but", "102:16", "there are companies that have people", "102:18", "kind of charging around in pads I am you", "102:21", "know with a virtual world that they can", "102:23", "skin in all sorts of different ways and", "102:25", "that's it's all exciting and as so", "102:27", "here's we're getting an image of what it", "102:29", "looks like to the people that are", "102:30", "playing it so and as things get more and", "102:33", "more accurate in terms of what you're", "102:35", "seeing and more realistic you could", "102:38", "conceivably be jumping up and down on", "102:40", "boxes and running up ladders and things", "102:43", "along those lines and actually doing it", "102:44", "in the virtual world as well as in the", "102:46", "real world yeah so right now like if", "102:48", "you've done the void you can tell", "102:49", "there's like a little gap between", "102:50", "reality and you wouldn't want to do like", "102:52", "a diving grab at a ladder rung but you", "102:55", "know it's you can see that there are", "102:57", "things we need to fix to get there but", "102:59", "that's all possible there's no can't be", "103:01", "done sort of thing there and eventually", "103:03", "you won't even need to be holding a", "103:04", "controller it'll be able to track your", "103:06", "whole body just from cameras and work", "103:08", "all the kind of computer vision magic", "103:10", "out from that and you will then be able", "103:12", "to set up these wonderful skinned", "103:14", "virtual environments yeah that's why I", "103:16", "was thinking like eSports in terms of", "103:20", "like an actual sport sport like eSports", "103:22", "in terms of like doing something on a", "103:25", "soccer field with a bunch of people with", "103:27", "virtual reality and they're playing some", "103:29", "sort of horrific nightmare dystopian", "103:32", "environment zombie game like whatever", "103:35", "you know fill in the blank with your", "103:37", "imagination yeah that's totally gonna be", "103:38", "here Wow that's how far away away from", "103:41", "that so a lot of it depends on kind of", "103:44", "company plans where we don't have people", "103:48", "pester us about the the technical hooks", "103:50", "for things like this and the people that", "103:51", "are doing it themselves like the void", "103:52", "they put their own tracking technology", "103:54", "on top of it because ours isn't set up", "103:57", "publicly in a way that they can do that", "103:59", "so it's a lot of work for people to do", "104:01", "it we will eventually commercialize it", "104:03", "so that you can set things up more", "104:05", "easily out of the box", "104:07", "I am but a lot of these then become", "104:09", "entrepreneurial business plans I'm like", "104:11", "okay who's gonna go raise the the tens", "104:13", "of millions of dollars to set up and do", "104:15", "it right but it's on the cusp of being", "104:17", "it's not a technical problem now it's", "104:20", "not a technical impossibility No", "104:22", "new research really needs to be done but", "104:24", "there's still lots of challenges to work", "104:25", "out so it's more about figuring out if", "104:28", "you can get the business plan to close", "104:29", "you can make the technology work how do", "104:32", "you have time to do other things like", "104:34", "how did you get involved in grappling", "104:36", "how do you have time to turbocharge", "104:38", "Ferraris like where do you come up with", "104:41", "the extra time to do all those other", "104:42", "things so you know I like to tell people", "104:44", "that I one of my pitches is like you", "104:46", "should always get enough sleep like I I", "104:48", "do not work well like I said I can't", "104:50", "work more than 13 hours if I if I don't", "104:52", "get eight hours of sleep I also start", "104:54", "falling down but there's a lot hours", "104:56", "left in the week after you're eight", "104:58", "hours of sleep there I like on the", "105:00", "martial arts side it's it is kind of", "105:02", "interesting where I I wrestled in junior", "105:04", "high and I did sort of Midwest YMCA judo", "105:07", "back then I wasn't any kind of a phenom", "105:09", "I was you know sort of a second-place", "105:11", "finisher for most of it but it was still", "105:12", "weird enough that the cunt cunt of the", "105:14", "school geek was pretty good at that type", "105:16", "of stuff I am I messed up my knees a", "105:19", "little bit doing that and in retrospect", "105:21", "I wish I had pushed on a little bit more", "105:23", "with that where in recent years I sort", "105:26", "of tried to challenge the the wrestler", "105:27", "ethos that I embrace the grind to people", "105:30", "where it's just like discipline is a", "105:31", "something I was always obsessed but I", "105:34", "could have done with a little more", "105:35", "discipline I am when I was younger and I", "105:37", "probably would have been better off if I", "105:39", "had I kind of stuck through some of the", "105:41", "the wrestling side of things I am but I", "105:44", "got back into it in my 30s where it was", "105:46", "kind of something I'm just again one of", "105:48", "the between projects well what", "105:50", "interesting thing do I want to take a", "105:51", "look at and I looked up some of the", "105:53", "local judo places and it was interesting", "105:56", "where the place that I wound up is", "105:58", "called Becerra judo and I had come again", "106:00", "from Midwest YMCA judo which is just", "106:02", "kind of you know you go and you learn", "106:04", "your moves and it's I it's not that", "106:06", "serious but this was a I you know he was", "106:09", "a Cuban Olympian and it still judo's", "106:12", "mostly kids you get mostly I kind of", "106:14", "teenage kids coming in but I go in there", "106:16", "and he's just yelling at the kids and", "106:18", "berating him it's like get up grab the", "106:19", "guy and all this stuff", "106:21", "much more serious training environment", "106:24", "but I got in there it's like hey I did", "106:26", "wrestling and judo back when I was a", "106:28", "teenager 20 years ago at that point but", "106:31", "I got on the mat rolled and I had enough", "106:33", "kind of wrestler instinct memories that", "106:35", "I", "106:36", "I'd go down I'd base out and then the", "106:37", "guy would roll me over an armbar me like", "106:39", "three times in a row cuz you know early", "106:41", "teens I YMCA they didn't teach you the", "106:43", "arm bars or anything I'm but that was", "106:46", "enough it's like hey I was having a good", "106:47", "time with that and so I did what I", "106:49", "always do on something I studied you", "106:51", "know I went and said well okay I let's", "106:54", "learn these arm bars and things and I", "106:56", "got them", "106:57", "you know the instructional and the tapes", "106:58", "and started working my way back through", "107:01", "that and got pretty good at that and", "107:03", "then my wife for Christmas one year got", "107:06", "me a year of private lessons with Carlos", "107:09", "Machado Wow yeah and that was where I", "107:13", "certainly took me up several levels", "107:15", "where I was in a situation where I had", "107:17", "armadillo aerospace my rocketry company", "107:20", "at the time we had enough space so I had", "107:22", "a bunch of mats set out there and I", "107:24", "would work with Carlos and one of the", "107:27", "other guys there on Saturdays and he", "107:30", "really tuned me up where I had a really", "107:33", "good straight arm bar that was my go-to", "107:34", "move for everything and against most of", "107:37", "the judo people that I it was just most", "107:40", "of them wouldn't know what hit them on", "107:41", "that I would just be able to get that", "107:42", "over and over again and there was a", "107:44", "period there where I had I am you know", "107:47", "I'd go mix it up at the club on one day", "107:50", "and then I had judo with one of my", "107:52", "coaches another day and then Carlos on", "107:54", "Saturday there was a period there where", "107:56", "I was pretty dangerous although I was I", "107:59", "was always one of the I never did", "108:01", "workout proper flow kind of just the way", "108:03", "to just kind of roll effortlessly I was", "108:05", "always a very tense aggressive I kind of", "108:08", "grappler and an interesting thing about", "108:11", "that where you know you know from", "108:13", "rolling with any of the the really good", "108:15", "guys I like rolling with Carlos it's", "108:17", "always happy fun he's smiling and you", "108:19", "always think you should be able to do", "108:21", "something but just actually can't but in", "108:23", "contrast with that one time when I went", "108:25", "to Japan I stopped in at the Kodokan you", "108:28", "know the home of Judo kind of the", "108:29", "ancestral land of Judo and you know it's", "108:32", "funny we're talking with a friend about", "108:34", "that I that also did some judo where", "108:36", "you'd think that that should be like", "108:38", "going to the Jedi Temple it should be", "108:40", "this majestic thing but it looks like an", "108:41", "old middle school when you go there", "108:42", "until you actually get out onto the mats", "108:44", "there but I remember I I did some", "108:47", "rolling with an old judo guy you know", "108:49", "gray-haired guy practicing his English", "108:50", "with me and it was shocking how", "108:52", "different it was versus rolling with", "108:54", "Carlos we're still he was way way better", "108:57", "than me but it was a sense where when I", "108:59", "was rolling with him I just felt I had", "109:00", "no options like for whatever reason I", "109:02", "was just always bound up and I couldn't", "109:04", "do anything until eventually gets my arm", "109:06", "and I tap as opposed to the fluidness", "109:09", "with Carlos where I'm like running", "109:11", "around thinking off I just do this maybe", "109:13", "I'll be able to get you know get around", "109:14", "yes", "109:15", "playing yeah yeah judges who's very", "109:17", "famous for playing my instructors his", "109:20", "brother yeah yeah you said you messed", "109:22", "your knees up of course back then I had", "109:25", "tweaked my knees in some way where it", "109:27", "wasn't bad enough that I had maybe at", "109:29", "the time I should have had surgery but I", "109:31", "did jujitsu training no this was", "109:34", "actually back in write one in wrestling", "109:36", "and one in judo when I was a teenager", "109:37", "and so that's why I've still got these", "109:39", "little stick legs cuz I could never lift", "109:41",

"109:48", "get your knees and Miraj I never did you", "109:51", "know again this was back and I like you", "109:53", "not embrace MRIs well so again this was", "109:56", "the 80s yeah they did but it's like you", "109:59", "know I was not you know it was a teenage", "110:01", "me back then and it was like okay my", "110:03", "knees are hurt a little bit no so by the", "110:06", "time I was in my 30s they generally felt", "110:08", "okay so that was when I decided I'm", "110:09", "gonna go back into Judo and and it's", "110:12", "been alright for quite a while and it's", "110:14", "you know it's interesting there were a", "110:16", "lot of people are surprised that I care", "110:18", "about this like I tweeted about going to", "110:19", "the UFC in Dallas and there are a number", "110:21", "of people that are like you know this is", "110:23", "shocking and disappointing that you know", "110:25", "that you like guy you know seeing people", "110:27", "harm each other", "110:28",

300", "118:18", "horsepower and would you get it up to", "118:20", "with the turbocharger so we went through", "118:21", "a number of steps of this and this is", "118:23", "all swapping out all the

of melting many", "118:36", "Pistons in the different devices in", "118:37", "different cars but that wound up being", "118:41", "this decade-long set of interesting", "118:43", "experiments there

lot of things in the chassis", "118:53", "after we melted the engine there we", "118:55", "tuned it back down a little bit that's", "118:57", "the way so many engineering things wind", "118:59", "up going you go it until it breaks then", "119:01", "you dial it back a little bit and you", "119:02", "stay there it must have been radically", "119:04", "fast for a 328 it's very light right yes", "119:07", "it's a kerb weight uh well it's not", "119:09", "superlight I think it was like 3,200", "119:11", "pounds something but yeah it you could", "119:13", "really feel it rear back when you went", "119:15", "into it and I'm at high speed is a", "119:18", "little bit dirty if you start getting up", "119:19", "in 150 40 miles an hour for that so we", "119:23", "thought well what's the next level where", "119:24", "do we go from here so I he had done a", "119:27", "twin turbo job on a Testarossa before", "119:30", "which is a much wider car I have you", "119:32", "know stock they would go 180 190 miles", "119:35", "an hour with a normal Ferrari trim and", "119:37", "and it was a bigger five liter flat 12", "119:40", "so there's a lot more possibility for", "119:42", "doing things there so I got I got a", "119:45", "Testarossa and we said alright we're", "119:47", "going to do the twin turbo job with", "119:49", "intercoolers with the new I you know the", "119:51", "new engine management systems and we", "119:54", "went through this long string of up", "119:56", "through this which generally was like", "119:58", "okay we melted the pistons we you know", "120:00", "broke the input shaft all these times", "120:02", "but at its top form in peak I still have", "120:06", "the dyno sheet for was like a thousand", "120:08", "and nine horsepower at the rear wheels", "120:10", "none of this crank horsepower talked", "120:11", "this was I you know over a thousand", "120:14", "horsepower at the rear wheels and it was", "120:16", "amazing that sounds ridiculous what does", "120:18", "standard horsepower with those it was", "120:20", "like 380 or something oh my god so it", "120:23", "was a huge huge difference and you had", "120:25", "all these things like you know he", "120:27", "couldn't launch like a dragster Ferrari", "120:29", "gear shifts or you know really gears in", "120:31", "a blender sort of thing and you've got a", "120:32", "dogleg first so it would not do a really", "120:35", "fast", "120:35", "0 to 60 but if you were on the highway I", "120:39", "am and you could just downshift to 4th", "120:41", "you could go from 50 to 150 faster than", "120:44",

"120:53", "fast how did it handsome really pretty", "120:56", "well so we we had bigger tires some", "120:58", "stiffer suspension on it it was not", "120:59", "designed to be a super track car I had", "121:02", "taken all of my Ferraris to the tracks", "121:04", "but I was no no pretensions about being", "121:06", "any kind of an SEC a champion or", "121:07", "anything but I could wing him I could", "121:09", "move him around the tracks reasonably", "121:11", "well but the main thing about this was", "121:13", "this just ungodly amount of power it was", "121:16", "this see Jesus effect

him later and I and I", "123:54", "think he had to get rid of it you know", "123:56", "after that then I had I had a Ferrari", "123:58", "f40 which is beautiful beautiful car and", "124:01", "that was the only car that I didn't", "124:03", "really modify I am all we did was turn", "124:06", "the wastegate and closed you know lock", "124:07", "that off so it was making all basically", "124:09",

didn't", "124:43", "even have eternal door handles they had", "124:44", "a little pull cord I inside there which", "124:47", "led to the point where there was one", "124:48", "time I was getting at
