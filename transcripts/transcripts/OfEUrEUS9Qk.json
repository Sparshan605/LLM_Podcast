I felt like Albert Einstein was", "22:43", "coming at me or something", "22:44", "you know because he's kind of like that", "22:45", "kind of like like he has a lure with him", "22:48", "yeah he does but that was 2015/16 I", "22:54", "think so those sounds like around when", "22:56", "he had a stroke", "22:57", "okay me I mean I've actually wouldn't", "22:58", "find out when he had a stroke he's", "23:01", "recovered very well though apparently he", "23:03", "still has some residual issues oh wow so", "23:06", "this is definitely pre-study 2016 yeah", "23:09", "so this is pretty sure the the the the", "23:12", "crazy thing is I've did all these", "23:13", "interviews with all these different", "23:14", "people didn't didn't actually post them", "23:16", "up online", "23:17", "why we did two with Wired magazine we", "23:20", "did the one with Ray Curtis well in one", "23:21", "with Stanley and I had like the rest", "23:23", "lined up but we wanted to you know like", "23:26", "present

is gonna be able to go back to", "28:26", "the moment that the time machine is", "28:28", "invented in any point along the way from", "28:30", "the end of time to the beginning of time", "28:32",

"28:43", "could be wrong", "28:44", "yeah but what's your like I think every", "28:46", "dog is gonna be completely fuckin gonzo", "28:48", "you're gonna have people appearing and", "28:49", "disappearing and and and showing up and", "28:51", "going and it's a normal thing it's like", "28:53", "oh yeah he's traveling through time it's", "28:55", "just not only that like all events say", "28:58", "if like you would would you know dive", "29:00", "but what if he was a world war five a", "29:03", "hundred years from now and you were like", "29:04", "fuck this I'm going back in time a", "29:06", "hundred years before World War five and", "29:08", "I'm just gonna live there and they do", "29:09", "they decide to do that or world war", "29:11", "three or World War 4 they just keep", "29:13", "going back in time and forward in time", "29:16", "you could go if you had a time machine", "29:18", "and the time machine was in again I'm", "29:20", "butchering this imma moron I'm outside", "29:21", "if you had a time machine and time", "29:24", "machines existed from now until you know", "29:27", "the perceivable end of the lifespan of", "29:31", "the earth right when the Sun supernovas", "29:34", "and there's no more life left on earth", "29:36", "you could kind of go anywhere you want", "29:39", "from now to a million years from now as", "29:41", "long as there's a place to go right as", "29:43", "long as there's a time machine available", "29:44", "and the idea is that time as we know it", "29:47", "will cease to exist because our time now", "29:49", "is dependent on

rough this time of day all", "30:00", "that stuff's gonna be nonsense if", "30:02", "there's time machines because you're", "30:03", "just gonna be able to move anywhere you", "30:05", "want at any

yeah and but it's we're", "30:37", "accustomed to it we", "30:39", "exactly so the idea is that what this", "30:42", "would do is change every aspect of", "30:46", "reality as we know it in terms of like", "30:48", "linear time it would no longer exist", "30:51", "but what would only those people that", "30:53", "know how to use a machine have access to", "30:55", "it well I mean wouldn't it be like cell", "30:57", "phones eventually everybody gets one and", "30:59", "we're talking about time right so if", "31:01", "everybody gets access to it a year from", "31:03", "now or three years from now it doesn't", "31:04", "matter because the time machine's", "31:05", "already been invented so they could", "31:07", "travel back to that moment and forward", "31:08", "from that moment so the moment they turn", "31:11", "that fucker on everything goes haywire", "31:13", "well so so let's not turn nothing on oh", "31:16", "it's weird and it's inevitable it's good", "31:19", "yeah well they want to see if they can", "31:21", "even make that happen I used to have a", "31:23", "bit that I used to do about the Big Bang", "31:26", "because they were truck everyone's", "31:28", "always tried to figure out like what was", "31:31", "the universe like before the Big Bang", "31:34", "like what what happened how was it", "31:37", "created and when you look at the", "31:40", "progress of Technology my thought was", "31:42", "that if you look at where we're going", "31:44", "and we're constantly innovating and", "31:46", "people are constantly coming up with new", "31:48", "and more impressive forms of technology", "31:50", "that one day we're gonna create a Big", "31:52", "Bang machine and that this is what", "31:54", "happens every five billion years or so", "31:57", "things get so intelligent they develop a", "32:00", "big bag machine and they sit around", "32:02", "these dudes are on Red Bull and xanax", "32:04", "and simulation and one guy goes I'll", "32:07", "fuckin press it and he hits the button", "32:09", "and boom the whole universe starts all", "32:11", "over again", "32:11", "and if you had a Big Bang Machine and", "32:14", "you knew that if you pressed it within", "32:16", "five billion years humans would create", "32:19", "another Big Bang machine this is an", "32:21", "endless cycle would you press it fucking", "32:24", "for sure there's someone that would", "32:25", "press that button yes 100 a person out", "32:28", "there that would press that button yeah", "32:31", "no I I heard more about the simulation", "32:33", "idea well that's another that's another", "32:36", "idea but that's Elon believes that he", "32:39", "believes that it's very possible like", "32:41", "like one of the things they said if you", "32:43", "could ask AI what would you ask you said", "32:46", "what's beyond the simulation like he", "32:48", "believes this is a simulation but if", "32:50", "you're Elon Musk", "32:51", "of course you'd believe", "32:52", "it's a simulation people who letting you", "32:54", "drill tunnels under la and shoot Rockets", "32:56", "off into space like an electric cars I", "33:01", "mean he's he's literally living like", "33:04", "some character in a movie that's her ex", "33:07", "or something yeah but if you're in a", "33:08", "simulation is nothing you can do about", "33:09", "it right so just might as well just do", "33:11", "it we do it all so it's a great way to", "33:13", "think like what is a simulation if", "33:16", "everything is a simulation it's still", "33:18", "life right like the existence exactly", "33:21", "everything you're accustomed to and", "33:23", "everything you experience and if it is a", "33:25", "simulation at least some aspects of this", "33:28", "are comfortably or comfortingly like", "33:33", "obvious like work hard you can get", "33:36", "better things right you can you know be", "33:38", "nice to people they're nice to you you", "33:40", "like B be a good friend you get good", "33:42", "friends eat healthy food you're", "33:44", "healthier there's there's like some", "33:46", "comfort to the lack of meaning that", "33:50", "there's there's certainly some variables", "33:53", "that are very difficult to account for", "33:55", "but there's also there's a surprising", "33:58", "amount of life that's pretty", "34:00", "straightforward", "34:01", "so it is a simulation it's not the most", "34:03", "difficult one to follow it's pretty", "34:05", "crazy and chaotic but there's there's a", "34:08", "lot of comfort in it like as much as we", "34:10", "try to dwell on the horrors of humanity", "34:13", "and certainly a lot of them disguise a", "34:14", "lot of beauty and people do and there's", "34:17", "a lot of cool shit in people yeah I mean", "34:19", "when you focus on that then yeah then", "34:21", "there's real growth I was at the Comedy", "34:23", "Store last night till like two o'clock", "34:24", "in the morning in this comedian's bar", "34:27", "just hanging out with all these", "34:28", "comedians we're just laughing and", "34:30", "talking and there's no no audience just", "34:34", "a bunch of people that get paid to make", "34:35", "people laugh on Jon Stewart was back", "34:38", "there Michelle wolf and all these really", "34:40", "funny comics we're all just laughs and", "34:42", "having a great time and talking and it", "34:44", "was I was like wow this is so nice and", "34:46", "reward so fun it's rewarding it's like", "34:48", "there's cool things in this life yeah if", "34:51", "you can find good people and friends and", "34:53", "and communicate and and and spread love", "34:56", "and have interesting fascinating", "34:59", "thought-provoking conversations there's", "35:01", "a lot of really positive things right so", "35:03", "this is the simulation", "35:05", "pretty badass adverse TV oh yeah Joe", "35:10", "Rogan you know making a brain foundation", "35:15", "I mean what a fucking great simulation", "35:17", "you're in absolutely I think yeah it's", "35:18", "like you you can make what you want of", "35:21", "it I mean it's not it might not be the", "35:23", "dream like the Elon Musk

my", "48:04", "whole point with neon future is the", "48:06", "convergence of I mean the ultimate goal", "48:08", "Z of convergence of technology and our", "48:10", "humanity to the point where we

the", "48:22", "trajectory of where technology is going", "48:23", "you know so we do live indefinitely", "48:26", "you know I mean that's like for me as", "48:30", "well you know my insurance policy for if", "48:33", "I don't make it to this point like my", "48:36", "dad didn't make it to that that cure is", "48:38", "you know obviously uh cryogenically", "48:42", "freezing the bra to do that while I'm", "48:44", "already signed up so you know cuz I feel", "48:47", "like I mean if we are really this", "48:49", "discussion is are we gonna make it there", "48:51", "in our timeline I'm 41 so I have a", "48:55", "better chance of Records well obviously", "48:56", "yeah so if I really believe that you", "49:01", "know I guess it's hopeful you know that", "49:04", "we'll get to this point in our", "49:05", "generation that will help make it it's", "49:08", "that close right so either we make it", "49:09", "and then I die and then everyone lives", "49:12", "forever", "49:13", "do I want to be that generation that of", "49:14", "people that die or the generation of", "49:16", "people I go oh death is as a cure we", "49:19", "just we just found we found a cure for", "49:22", "death just like a cure for cancer just", "49:23", "like a cure for whatever what if after", "49:25", "your biological body ceases to function", "49:28", "you move into a new realm of reality", "49:32", "that is a completely different dimension", "49:35", "that's filled with love and", "49:36", "understanding like the after death yeah", "49:38", "what is that we don't know there's no", "49:40", "biological shortcomings", "49:42", "there's no emotions and there's no fear", "49:46", "none of that and there's there's no", "49:47", "bodies you just you're a soul in another", "49:50", "dimension and then
