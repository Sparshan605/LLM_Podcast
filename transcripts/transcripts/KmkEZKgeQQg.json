need", "50:18", "an explanation fuck their feelings", "50:21", "rains are constructed in such a way that", "50:22", "we need an end yeah yeah or else.you", "50:26", "yeah don't understand where am I now I", "50:28", "have there's no end my very uninformed", "50:30", "theory which is that first off that", "50:34", "everything is meaningless but that only", "50:37", "the brain-damaged are capable

and that gave us an", "51:21", "advantage over other animals and so our", "51:24", "brains just evolved and then when we got", "51:26", "to the point we realized we're gonna die", "51:27", "oh we go well there's got to be some", "51:29", "meaning there too so then we had to", "51:31", "create myths that where do we get", "51:34", "created meaning about our lives that's a", "51:36", "very

of", "52:47", "atheists are tend to be artists who", "52:49", "believe that they live on through their", "52:50", "work and which is totally as stupid as", "52:53", "believing in God", "52:53", "it is it's definitely silly I mean", "52:55", "obviously someone's going to enjoy your", "52:57", "work but I think the real meaning is in", "52:59", "creating the work and then the fact that", "53:01",

study", "53:14", "where they went all like into the", "53:15", "jungles of the Amazon to people who have", "53:19", "never had any contact with the modern", "53:20", "world and they drew a circle with two", "53:22", "dots and a curved line and everyone sees", "53:24", "a face", "53:25", "hmm everyone sees a face the only people", "53:27", "who don't see a face are people who have", "53:29", "been

that because there's", "58:15", "just way too much evidence that it is", "58:16", "real", "58:17", "what evidence well radar evidence that", "58:21", "the the f-16 locked on a UFO that", "58:24", "footage and also just uh like I know the", "58:27", "friend of ours I don't know if she want", "58:29", "us to say but her father was an air", "58:32", "traffic controller mm-hmm and he told",

were", "58:48", "abducted yeah yeah the abducted one is a", "58:51", "little easier to wrap your head around", "58:52", "because when you're sleeping your brain", "58:55", "is producing all sorts of endogenous", "58:57", "psychedelic chemicals yeah almost all of", "58:59", "these experiences happen when you're", "59:01", "sleeping almost all these experience", "59:03", "when these people are abducted they're", "59:04", "taken from their beds which is when", "59:05", "they're dreaming yeah I mean it's just", "59:07", "like there's some real clear easy steps", "59:09", "to follow for no fault Occam's razor and", "59:11", "not you not get crazy but it knocks", "59:13", "those out but it doesn't knock out like", "59:14", "Barney and Betty hill and all the people", "59:15", "that are affected will fully conscious", "59:17", "and that and that remember it without", "59:19", "hypnotherapy", "59:21", "like I'm not sure about the abduction", "59:22", "phenomenon but all right I don't know", "59:24", "Barney and Betty hill I know the story", "59:25", "you know I don't know them yeah so I", "59:27", "would have to know them because yeah", "59:29", "there's a lot of people that I've told", "59:31", "like I did a show for sci-fi called Joe", "59:33", "Rogan questions everything yeah I watch", "59:35", "that show that cured me that show cured", "59:37", "me of a lot of my nonsense with with", "59:40", "conspiracies well we used to talk about", "59:42", "yes yeah that's tough all the time yeah", "59:44", "yeah but I I needed to actually study it", "59:47", "so for six months that's basically all I", "59:49", "did I interviewed people and I like", "59:53", "Bigfoot believers UFO believers all and", "59:56", "the one thing that they have in common", "59:58", "is they all seem to be kind of lost and", "60:03", "dependent upon this thing being real", "60:05", "yeah great", "60:05", "instead of being objective there's only", "60:07", "one lady that I interviewed that saw", "60:09", "Bigfoot that really seemed to be telling", "60:12", "the truth but I think she saw a bear", "60:13", "yeah bears walk on two feet all the time", "60:16", "they do it all the time as video footage", "60:18", "you can find it all the time and she was", "60:20", "in the Pacific Northwest which is", "60:21", "incredibly dense woods you see something", "60:24", "you glimpse it look I was hunting once", "60:26", "in in in Canada and Alberta and I", "60:28", "thought I saw a wolf for like two", "60:29", "seconds it was a squirrel okay", "60:31", "understand this no no I just saw fur", "60:37", "right I saw her and I was cause it's", "60:39", "really because I was looking for fucking", "60:42", "wolves cuz I was like cuz I know we did", "60:44", "see one wolf it cross the roads either", "60:47", "wolf or coyote was hard to tell because", "60:49", "it was at dusk it was very dark out but", "60:51", "when you're looking for something you", "60:54", "think everything is that thing you're", "60:55", "looking yeah so like a thought that", "60:58", "fucking squirrel was a wolf", "61:00", "that's funny yeah well expectation and", "61:02", "perception are very linked yes", "61:03", "yeah well that they found that that 50%", "61:08", "of everything you see is a product of", "61:10", "memory yes that that when you observe", "61:12", "something they've done FMF MRIs and that", "61:15", "most of the activity in the brain is in", "61:17", "the memory centers not in the visual", "61:19", "centers interesting only about 50% of", "61:21", "the activities in the visual center so", "61:23", "you know crazy yeah thing is very I when", "61:26", "I was a kid I went and saw Carl Sagan", "61:29", "speak mm-hm", "61:30", "U of T at the University of Toronto and", "61:32", "I was like you know 14 but he did an", "61:34", "equation", "61:35", "on the board of the possibility of alien", "61:39", "life other than us in the universe and", "61:42", "it came to the smallest I mean he spent", "61:45", "the whole time writing on this", "61:46", "chalkboard", "61:47", "mm-hm it was fascinating hmm he actually", "61:49", "came up with a number at the end and it", "61:52", "was such a small he says there is there", "61:56", "is something out there but they are so", "62:00", "far away that yeah they'll that unless", "62:04", "they can go faster than the speed of", "62:06", "light which he said was impossible at", "62:09", "the time", "62:09", "yeah the 70s yeah there's no way we've", "62:14", "seen them that's what he said so if some", "62:16", "other beings have conquered the speed of", "62:19", "light thing then maybe we could see them", "62:22", "yeah but that's a thing with who's that", "62:26", "problem with this skepticism in general", "62:27", "is like that it you know like like the", "62:31", "skeptic skeptics of the 19th century the", "62:34", "ones who say germs don't exist right", "62:36", "because we can't see them and and people", "62:38", "who said germs did exist were ridiculed", "62:40", "and laughed out of the trade mm-hmm", "62:41", "right and I agree with you completely", "62:44", "just because you can't see it or it's", "62:46", "not happening doesn't mean it can't", "62:48", "happen and even since Sagan's day there", "62:51", "had been no exoplanets discovered then", "62:52", "right we now though there are literally", "62:54", "trillions and trillions of it sure", "62:56", "planned earth-like planets yeah well", "62:59", "they did they just speculated us to the", "63:00", "existence of them outside of our solar", "63:02", "system before the the real problem is", "63:04", "that if some there's a leap and a leap a", "63:07", "technological leap that opens the doors", "63:09", "to massive innovation yeah that once", "63:12", "this happens once this happens in this", "63:15", "and then all this stuff sort of", "63:17", "exponentially expands in terms of", "63:19", "technological possibilities all you", "63:22", "would need is a few hundred years and", "63:25", "you have an unrecognizable set of", "63:28", "technology yeah sure you know I mean we", "63:31", "were talking about CERN I mean you know", "63:33", "antimatter an idea that they're still", "63:35", "trying to figure out yeah that's an", "63:39", "unseen source of energy general you have", "63:42", "never even experienced yeah you know", "63:44", "with them with a grain of sand yeah", "63:48", "city and it's that big yeah and there's", "63:51", "also the theory there's recent one that", "63:53", "space-time itself doesn't exist so the", "63:56", "the speed of light barrier becomes moot", "63:59", "because that is I guess it's the", "64:01", "holographic quantum hologram their", "64:04", "quantum holographic theory of the", "64:05", "universe yeah Albert's book I can't", "64:09", "remember holographic universe but it's", "64:11", "yeah I think so and but the idea that", "64:13", "the universe is basically just a tree", "64:15", "that that when you look at it from a", "64:17", "certain angle seems three-dimensional", "64:18", "right and it folds on folds into itself", "64:20", "so you could and it's Ravel that's the", "64:23", "wormhole thing well that's it's not even", "64:25", "that is the idea that that that", "64:27", "space-time is an illusion is and that", "64:30", "that it doesn't really exist and that's", "64:32", "why you know like entanglement is", "64:35", "possible you know the idea that you know", "64:38", "spooky action at a distance yes that", "64:40", "yeah yeah but the reason that you know", "64:44", "you know these you know atoms on", "64:48", "opposite ends of the universe can be", "64:49", "affect each other instantaneously at the", "64:51", "same moment is because they're not", "64:53", "really at an opposite into the universe", "64:54", "they're really right next to each other", "64:55", "it just seems like they're at opposite", "64:57", "ends in the universe because our ability", "64:58", "to perceive is basically based on what", "65:01", "we have to do to stay alive on this", "65:04", "planet who's our meager little chimp", "65:06", "brains trying to trying to quantify all", "65:10", "of these things that are around us all", "65:12", "the time so we put them into this sort", "65:14", "of three-dimensional box of movement and", "65:16", "distance and that the entire am the", "65:18", "entire universe could be a compact thing", "65:21", "yeah that projects itself like a", "65:23", "hologram onto a screen I love these kind", "65:26", "of conversations because I'm clearly too", "65:27", "stupid to really understand what and I", "65:31", "don't understand you to say how stupid", "65:33", "well we don't understand each other", "65:35", "yes is part we're all the same yeah like", "65:38", "I think I'd be interesting to do a good", "65:40", "document or something about from about", "65:43", "you apology because one thing is the", "65:45", "assumption that their extraterrestrial", "65:46", "is an assumption mm-hmm", "65:48", "but I think it intrigues me is the power", "65:51", "of ridicule to silence yes even the most", "65:54", "intelligent people in our community from", "65:56", "examining something like the ridicule", "65:58", "kept doctors from accepting germs sure", "66:01", "because they didn't want to they didn't", "66:03", "want to be ridiculed by their peers", "66:05", "mm-hmm and even now you've got people", "66:07", "that will like Michael Shermer will", "66:09", "cling to the most absurd explanations", "66:12", "for a phenomenon like the f-16 radar", "66:16", "footage what did he what was Michael", "66:19", "Shermer I can't remember it but it was", "66:20", "it was pretty it really went to great", "66:23", "lengths that entailed having to", "66:25", "basically diminish any respect you had", "66:29", "for any of the people who reported on", "66:31", "the events hmm I had to go and had to go", "66:34", "into character assassination in order to", "66:35", "to eliminate it", "66:36", "yeah that's the best way to kill an idea", "66:38", "he's a professional skeptic and I like", "66:40", "Michael a lot and he's been on the", "66:42", "podcast many times yeah I actually had", "66:44", "him debate Randall Carlson and Graham", "66:47", "Hancock about these ancient", "66:49", "civilizations and it wasn't very good", "66:51", "for him there are some psyche moments as", "66:54", "skeptics are believers well the problem", "66:56", "is their instance they believe in the", "66:58", "problem is being a skeptic itself it's a", "67:01", "stupid way to look at the world it's a", "67:02", "jet you're actually not sure about", "67:04", "something I don't mean you should be", "67:05", "objective right don't be skeptical right", "67:08", "being skeptical no but I know for sure", "67:11", "that that's not true yeah but it serves", "67:14", "a massive purpose for people that really", "67:16", "don't understand things and he can", "67:19", "explain to you and with actual science", "67:21", "as long as the actual science is being", "67:23", "used and it's not Cara the assassination", "67:25", "it's not mockery it's not it's not", "67:28", "there's certain people that are just", "67:30", "deep bunkers they can call themselves", "67:32", "skeptics but they're not looking at", "67:34", "thing like oh maybe that is effective", "67:36", "maybe that is healthy yeah that is", "67:37", "interesting no they don't look at it", "67:39", "that way they're looking at it they're", "67:41", "trying to pick it apart and that's fine", "67:44", "if you can pick it apart but if you", "67:46", "cannot you have to be objective about", "67:48", "the fact that oh well this is a very", "67:50", "interesting phenomenon and this is what", "67:52", "we know about science is that and this", "67:53", "is what we know about this thing and now", "67:55", "right now we have we have a weird", "67:57", "conundrum did Chariots of the Gods yeah", "67:59", "did he Erich von d\u00e4niken was he was he", "68:03", "believed 100% he's all is still in it", "68:06", "all in I asked him the first thing I", "68:07", "asked him I said what is that Maas yeah", "68:09", "desperately have to go go go yeah the", "68:11", "first thing I asked him was what is the", "68:14", "most", "68:15", "compelling piece of evidence there's the", "68:17", "you know and he pointed to this Mayan", "68:21", "stone plaque that's in Palenque", "68:25", "have you ever seen it it's a book yeah", "68:28", "it's a god one of their one of their", "68:32", "former Kings that is lying on his back", "68:35", "and he's looks like he's moving some", "68:37", "Jaime see if we could find that thing", "68:39", "it's just really cool carving that they", "68:43", "found that looks like there's a guy who", "68:45", "is in a seat and it looks like this fire", "68:48", "behind his back and you could say them", "68:51", "like you could say that he's", "68:52", "manipulating controls on a ship and he's", "68:56", "you know shooting a rocket into the", "68:57", "heaven I would like to see what this the", "69:01", "mainstream version of that is because", "69:03", "also it could just be art you know an", "69:06", "imagination", "69:06", "yeah it could be that they they knew", "69:09", "about certain things being propelled by", "69:11", "fire there it is", "69:13", "yeah that's it so if you see this I mean", "69:16", "that's a big a stretch to say that guys", "69:18", "in a spaceship I don't know what the", "69:19", "fuck that is he's sitting down like an", "69:21", "altar kind of he could yeah but it", "69:24", "doesn't look like he's looking through", "69:25", "an eyepiece right what's true but what", "69:28", "does that mean is it a telescope maybe", "69:29", "he's just got a telescope or maybe it's", "69:31", "just an astronomer yeah it is possible I", "69:34", "don't think they had
