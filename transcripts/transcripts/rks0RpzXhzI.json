the", "119:02", "human behavior exactly and so here's so", "119:05", "just to kind of repeat what I had told", "119:07", "Sam so there are different decision", "119:09", "rules that one can use when they're", "119:11", "making a choice between the competing", "119:13", "alternatives so for example if you're", "119:14", "choosing between cars each car is", "119:16", "defined by many attributes

in choosing", "119:26", "between car a and car B so here's one", "119:28", "rule I could look at take all the", "119:30", "attributes put them together multiply", "119:32", "them by the importance

the", "119:41", "attributes together she ends up scoring", "119:43", "higher than Donald Trump but here's", "119:45", "another the decision rule it's called", "119:46", "the lexicographic rule lexicographic", "119:48", "rule basically says I simply look at my", "119:51", "important attribute what's the attribute", "119:54", "that I care most when I'm making the", "119:56", "choice within this category and I simply", "119:58", "choose the alternative that scores", "120:00", "higher on that most important attribute", "120:02", "so for example if it were cars I only", "120:05", "care about the power of the engine so I", "120:07", "choose car a because it has a stronger", "120:09", "power engine right in the case of Donald", "120:12", "Trump versus Hillary Clinton suppose", "120:14", "that my lexicographic rule is I care", "120:17", "only about the position on immigration", "120:19", "that's my decision that's the only thing", "120:22", "I look at well it's very reasonable for", "120:25", "people to think that Donald Trump had a", "120:27", "more conservative tough view on", "120:30", "immigration than Hillary Clinton so if I", "120:32", "use that decision

again all I did not unlike", "120:52", "what Scott Adams did in his own way", "120:54", "is offer the different psychological", "120:57", "processes by which a very reasonable", "121:00", "person can
