["00:02", "boom and we're live hello sir how are", "00:05", "you hi thanks what you eaten chocolate", "00:09", "when you got here and you told me that", "00:10", "you are a cacao shaman and I said those", "00:13", "are strong words they are what does that", "00:14", "mean so I was in Berlin last year giving", "00:17", "a talk at a tech conference and somebody", "00:18", "invited me to a sacred cacao ceremony", "00:21", "never heard of it I thought wow that", "00:22", "sounds awesome I love chocolate I went", "00:25", "it was so wonderful and at the end they", "00:27", "were talking about these people these", "00:28", "great cacao shamans and I thought what", "00:31", "is that I gotta be one of those since I", "00:33", "came back I looked for certification", "00:35", "there wasn't certification I self", "00:37", "declared and then I started doing cacao", "00:40", "ceremonies in New York and I have", "00:41", "hundreds of people who come it's really", "00:43", "wonderful and it's exciting like if you", "00:45", "want to be a doctor you gotta go to", "00:46", "medical school right a comedian you got", "00:49", "to become a professional you gotta put", "00:51", "in your time cacao shaman just show up", "00:52", "it's like jingle hey I'm like a cow", "00:55", "shaman if anybody shuts up and they have", "00:56", "a good time then you're real now how", "00:58", "much do you need to know about cacao", "00:59", "like the nutritional properties of a", "01:01", "cacao is amazing it's great stuff it's", "01:04", "incredible and then so definitely cacao", "01:06", "and people have been using it", "01:07", "ceremonially for about 5,000 years so", "01:10", "it's incredible chocolate makes people", "01:13", "happy it helps your brain function your", "01:16", "circulation there's all these kinds of", "01:17", "incredible things but then the", "01:19", "ceremonies that I do have two key", "01:21", "messages one is you are the drug I mean", "01:24", "we all take people take drugs people", "01:26", "take ayahuasca and psilocybin all these", "01:29", "kinds of things but I also think that we", "01:31", "have for the things that we take drugs", "01:33", "for there's kind of release and", "01:35", "happiness and joy we have those things", "01:37", "inside of us and we just kind of get out", "01:39", "of our way we can experience them the", "01:41", "second thing is I believe that there are", "01:44", "no I say this in my Sarah moans there's", "01:45", "no such thing as sacred cacao or sacred", "01:48", "plants or sacred mountains or sacred", "01:50", "people if we don't treat life with", "01:52", "sacredness but if we recognize that", "01:54", "everything is sacred", "01:55", "then we infuse life with sacredness and", "01:57", "meaning and that's anyway that's why I", "01:59", "do it's a lot of fun that's very", "02:00", "interesting from a guy who specializes", "02:02", "essentially in manipulating life well", "02:06", "you know we have manipulated life as", "02:09", "humans for a very short on time but it's", "02:11", "but it's interesting", "02:12", "yeah you know the idea of things being", "02:13", "sacred but your specialty is", "02:16", "manipulating genetics right yeah well so", "02:19", "that is this strange moment that we're", "02:22", "in these for about for about 3.8 billion", "02:25", "years our species has evolved by this", "02:28", "set of principles we call Darwinian", "02:30", "evolution random mutation and natural", "02:31", "selection it's brought us here we used", "02:33", "to be single-cell organisms and now look", "02:35", "at us hmm and there's been a lot of", "02:37", "magic in that process and there still is", "02:39", "but we humans are deciphering some of", "02:42", "that magic we are like looking under the", "02:45", "hood of what it means to be human and we", "02:46", "are increasingly going to have the", "02:47", "ability to manipulate all of life", "02:50", "including our own yeah that is very", "02:53", "unnerving to a lot of people yeah it's", "02:56", "uncomfortable and scary and yeah it is", "02:59", "they like things the way they are we", "03:01", "only I'd like to stay the way I am we", "03:03", "always think that there's no we always", "03:05", "think that because there's a built-in", "03:07", "concern conservatism in our brains and", "03:10", "yet we live these lives that are", "03:13", "entirely dependent on these radical", "03:15", "changes that our ancestors have created", "03:18", "I mean we didn't find this building or", "03:21", "agriculture or medicine in nature we", "03:24", "built all those things then everybody", "03:25", "gets a new baseline when you're born and", "03:27", "you think well you know I'm I want the", "03:30", "organic corn mm-hmm I want whatever but", "03:34", "all these things are creation we live an", "03:36", "entirely created world and our ability", "03:39", "to manipulate and change that world is", "03:41", "always growing and I think we need to", "03:43", "recognize that but there's being afraid", "03:45", "is is okay and being excited is okay and", "03:48", "we need to find the right balance", "03:49", "between those two emotions I think for a", "03:51", "lot of people they feel like so many", "03:53", "changes happen", "03:54", "particularly when you talk about", "03:55", "genetically modified foods so many", "03:57", "things happened before they realized", "03:59", "they had happened so when they're like", "04:00", "hey man I don't want any eat any GMO", "04:02", "fruit well then you probably shouldn't", "04:05", "eat any fruit yep because everything", "04:07", "that you buy has been changed yeah every", "04:10", "orange that you buy that that's what an", "04:12", "orange used to be like yeah good buy an", "04:14", "apple apples didn't used to be like that", "04:16", "tomatoes didn't used to be like that now", "04:17", "I know that's we reset our baseline just", "04:20", "from when we were kids so if you went", "04:22", "back twelve thousand years ago", "04:24", "to the end of the last ice age and you", "04:26", "said all right find me all these things", "04:27", "that we buy at Whole Foods most of them", "04:29", "didn't exist we've created them sure and", "04:31", "then in the 1970s we had the ability to", "04:34", "do what's recombinant DNA people call", "04:36", "genetic modification and people are", "04:39", "afraid because it's well that feels", "04:41", "unnatural we're applying science to to", "04:44", "food and you know that's that's the", "04:47", "issue and now we're we're entering the", "04:49", "era of genetically modified humans and", "04:51", "there's that same level of", "04:52", "uncomfortableness but what happened the", "04:54", "reason why I've written this this book", "04:56", "hacking Darwin is that if we approach", "04:58", "genetically modified humans in the same", "05:01", "way they're we approach uniquely", "05:02", "modified foods which is the scientists", "05:05", "say hey we've got this we're gonna", "05:06", "manage them responsibly and it just kind", "05:09", "of happens to people people are gonna go", "05:11", "nuts", "05:11", "I mean you imagine how agitating people", "05:13", "are about GMO foods if they don't have a", "05:16", "say in how the genetic the experience", "05:19", "the human experience of genetic", "05:20", "modification plays out people are going", "05:23", "to go berserk so we have this window of", "05:24", "time we can start bringing everybody", "05:27", "into an inclusive conversation about", "05:29", "where we're going because where we are", "05:30", "going is just radically different from", "05:32", "where we've been yeah I think it's an", "05:35", "awareness issue and I also think it's a", "05:38", "perception issue I think that everything", "05:40", "people do is natural including cities I", "05:43", "think cities our natural that's why", "05:44", "they're all over the world yeah I think", "05:46", "there is naturals beehives and I think", "05:48", "as much as we like to think that", "05:49", "technology is not natural it's clearly", "05:51", "something people naturally make of", "05:53", "course they make it in every culture", "05:55", "yeah I think it's the history of our", "05:57", "species and we kind of misused this word", "05:59", "naturally because what is natural I mean", "06:02", "maybe natural was when we used to live", "06:05", "and we were just part of nature I always", "06:08", "say it's like people say oh I love", "06:09", "nature I love like going out and hiking", "06:11", "in the woods the reason you love hiking", "06:13", "in the woods is that we've murdered all", "06:15", "the Predators it's like in the old days", "06:16", "and you stay in your cave you're not", "06:19", "going out and hiking in the woods", "06:20", "there's stuff that's gonna kill you out", "06:21", "there I know that was a massive luxury", "06:23", "to go wander through the forest with no", "06:25", "weapons yeah nobody did oh I want nature", "06:30", "I want my you know my natural corn I", "06:31", "want my my natural Chihuahua even though", "06:35", "you know 25 thousand years ago there's", "06:37", "no", "06:37", "chihuahuas or wolves wolves yeah and", "06:39", "look what we've done to them I know", "06:40", "we'll look what we have done to them", "06:41", "yeah them pugs yeah if you had natural", "06:44", "wheat like or natural corn in particular", "06:46", "natural corn spent a tiny little thing", "06:48", "yes a few a few weeds yeah weird gross", "06:52", "little bout grain yeah and then now we", "06:54", "made it this big juicy sweet delicious", "06:57", "thing you put butter on which is great", "07:00", "but we grate we cannot have glyphosate", "07:03", "glyphosate but we can't we can't", "07:06", "fetishize that there's some kind of", "07:07", "imaginary world where kind of everybody", "07:10", "was wearing Birkenstocks and eating in", "07:13", "Whole Foods that imaginary world sucked", "07:14", "for us that's why we left it it's true", "07:16", "but there's some sort of a balance right", "07:18", "we we do appreciate the nature aspect of", "07:22", "our world and Eagles and salmon and all", "07:25", "these wild things and to be able to see", "07:27", "them as very cool yeah but yeah you", "07:29", "don't want to get eaten by those things", "07:30", "you don't want them everywhere you you", "07:32", "want to be able to go out and get your", "07:33", "newspaper without being worried about", "07:35", "getting attacked by a Jaguar it helps", "07:37", "yeah you when you think about the future", "07:42", "at least me then we tell you my concern", "07:45", "yeah I'm worried that rich people are", "07:47", "gonna get a hold this technology quick", "07:49", "and they're going to have massive unfair", "07:52", "advantages in terms of intellect in", "07:55", "terms of physical athletic ability Ulta", "07:57", "I mean we we really can have a grossly", "08:00", "imbalanced world radically quickly if", "08:02", "this happens fast when we don't", "08:05", "understand exactly what the consequences", "08:08", "of these actions are until it's too late", "08:09", "and then we try to play catch-up with", "08:11", "rules and regulations and laws yeah", "08:14", "that's a very very real danger and", "08:16", "that's why I've written this book that's", "08:18", "why I'm out speaking every day about", "08:20", "this in this topic because we need to", "08:22", "recognize that if we have if we approach", "08:24", "these revolutionary technologies using", "08:26", "the same values that we experience today", "08:30", "we're you know we're here and very", "08:32", "comfortable but just down the road there", "08:33", "are people who are just who are living", "08:34", "without many opportunities there are", "08:36", "people in parts of the world like", "08:38", "Central African Republic where there's", "08:40", "just a war zone kids are born", "08:41", "malnourished if those are our values", "08:44", "today we can expect that when these", "08:47", "future technologies arrive we'll use", "08:50", "those the", "08:51", "the same value so it's real and right", "08:53", "now we have an opportunity to say all", "08:55", "right these technologies are coming", "08:57", "whatever we do these technologies are", "08:58", "coming there's a better possible future", "09:01", "and a worse possible future and how can", "09:03", "we infuse our best values into the", "09:05", "process to optimize the good stuff and", "09:07", "minimize the bad stuff and certainly", "09:08", "what you're saying is a real risk thing", "09:10", "of what happened when European countries", "09:13", "had slightly better weapons and slightly", "09:15", "better ships than everybody else they", "09:17", "took over the world and dominated", "09:19", "everybody and so yeah that's it's very", "09:21", "real that's the government's need to", "09:23", "play a role in ensuring broad access and", "09:26", "in regulating these these technologies", "09:29", "to make sure we don't get to that kind", "09:31", "of dystopian scenario that you've laid", "09:33", "out well it's also in terms of", "09:35", "governments regulating things like why", "09:37", "are they qualified who are they who are", "09:39", "the government's or just people", "09:41", "right there's people that are either", "09:42", "elected or that you know or yeah some", "09:45", "sort of a monarchy or you you're dealing", "09:47", "with either kings and queens and sheiks", "09:50", "or you're dealing with presidents and", "09:52", "we've seen in this country that", "09:54", "sometimes our presidents don't know what", "09:55", "the fuck they're talking about right so", "09:57", "who are they to disrupt science just to", "10:01", "disrupt this natural flow of Technology", "10:03", "well we designed we need somebody to do", "10:06", "it we need some representation of our", "10:08", "collective will but just to avoid some", "10:11", "of the things like you just like you", "10:12", "just mentioned that that's the reason", "10:13", "why humans banded together and made", "10:16", "these kind of created governments and", "10:19", "the reason for democracy especially if", "10:21", "you have more functioning democracies is", "10:23", "that your government in some ways", "10:25", "reflects the will of the people and the", "10:28", "government does things that individuals", "10:30", "can't do and I know there are other", "10:32", "libertarian arguments well everyone", "10:34", "should just like if you want a little", "10:35", "road in front of your house either go", "10:36", "build the road or you can pay somebody", "10:38", "but they're a lot of things in even in", "10:40", "that model that won't get done there are", "10:42", "a lot of kind of big national even", "10:44", "global concerns that you need some kind", "10:46", "of of regulation because what we're", "10:49", "talking about is the future of life and", "10:52", "run life on Earth and there have to be", "10:54", "some kind of guardrails and that's why", "10:55", "what I'm arguing for is we really need a", "10:58", "bottom-up I think we every person and", "11:00", "that's why I'm so thrilled to be here", "11:02", "with you today Joe every person needs to", "11:04", "read", "11:04", "understand these revolutionary", "11:06", "technologies like genetics like AI and", "11:08", "all of our responsibilities and", "11:11", "opportunities to say hey this is really", "11:13", "important here are the values that I", "11:15", "think the that I cherish and just like", "11:18", "you said I don't want it to be that the", "11:21", "wealthiest people are the ones who have", "11:23", "kids with higher IQs and live longer and", "11:25", "healthier than everybody else and then", "11:26", "so we have to raise our voice and there", "11:30", "needs to be a bottom-up process and a", "11:31", "top-down process and it's really hard", "11:34", "the many people have a concern that", "11:37", "someone else is going to do what we're", "11:40", "not willing to do first yes right", "11:42", "they're worried China and Russia those", "11:44", "are the big ones China and Russia", "11:45", "especially China yeah they're very", "11:46", "technologically advanced and their", "11:49", "innovations off-the-chain when it comes", "11:51", "to the qua way just recently surpassed", "11:53", "apples the number two cell phone",

planet Earth I mean they they hustle", "12:07", "and if they just decide to make super", "12:09", "people and they they do it before we do", "12:12", "that's what people were worried about", "12:13", "right there were yeah they're worried", "12:15", "about these trivial things", "12:16", "we're seemingly trivial like athletics", "12:18", "and then there's things that are really", "12:21", "Chris to stop people from just becoming", "12:24", "the Hulk what's to stop people from", "12:26", "becoming immortal", "12:28", "what's the studying whiz well two", "12:31", "questions first is is China I think it's", "12:34", "a really big issue the 21st the story of", "12:36", "the 21st century one of the biggest", "12:38", "stories of the 21st century will be how", "12:40", "the us-china rivalry

2050 they're", "12:52", "putting huge resources they have really", "12:54", "smart people they are really focused on", "12:56", "that and it's a big deal yeah in genetic", "12:59", "technologies when last year of the book", "13:03", "hacking darm was already in production", "13:04", "in November when it was announced that", "13:06", "these first genetically engineered", "13:07", "babies had been born in China and so I", "13:09", "called the publisher and say we need to", "13:10", "pull this back out of productions I need", "13:12", "to reference this but it didn't require", "13:14", "much of a chain of so I'd already", "13:15", "written this is happening we're going to", "13:18", "see the world", "13:18", "edited humans it's going to happen first", "13:21", "in China and here's why so I said had", "13:23", "had to add a few sentences saying and it", "13:25", "just happened in in October of 2018 so", "13:28", "China is on that path and we need to", "13:32", "recognize that on one hand the United", "13:34", "States needs to be competitive on the", "13:38", "other hand we don't want a runway arms", "13:41", "race of the human race and that's why we", "13:43", "need to find this balance between", "13:43", "national ambition and some kind of", "13:47", "global rules but it's really hard to do", "13:49", "yeah and the other thing is that we're", "13:52", "competing with them yeah and so if they", "13:54", "decide to do it first we're almost", "13:56", "compelled to do it second or compel to", "13:59", "try to keep up yeah but how far away do", "14:01", "you think we are from physically", "14:03", "manipulating living human beings versus", "14:07", "fetuses versus yes something in the wool", "14:09", "so physically manipulating living human", "14:11", "beings we're there yeah yeah so that's", "14:14", "it may often it's it's called gene", "14:16", "therapy so for example there's a whole", "14:18", "class of treatments for for treating", "14:21", "cancer called Carty therapy so you have", "14:23", "a cancer when you're younger your body", "14:26", "is better able to fight cancers what you", "14:29", "can do some of the cancer you take their", "14:31", "cells you give their you manipulate", "14:34", "their cells to give them cancer fighting", "14:35", "superpowers and you put them back into", "14:38", "the person's body and now the person's", "14:40", "body behaves like you're a younger", "14:42", "person you have the ability to fight", "14:43", "back so gene therapies are already", "14:44", "happening", "14:45", "a relatively small number of them have", "14:47", "already been approved but there is a", "14:50", "list of thousands of them with", "14:52", "regulators in applications to regulators", "14:55", "around the world so that the era of in", "14:57", "making genetic changes to living humans", "15:00", "that's already here look what can they", "15:02", "do with it so far so so far most of it", "15:05", "is focused on treating diseases but a", "15:09", "lot more is is coming because when", "15:11", "people think about the the human the", "15:13", "genome our genome isn't a disease genome", "15:16", "it's not a health care gene genome it's", "15:17", "a human genome and so we are going to be", "15:20", "able to do things that feel like crazy", "15:22", "things like changing people's eye color", "15:23", "changing people's skin color to funky", "15:26", "things I mean there's a lot of there", "15:28", "were stuff that we're not doing now that", "15:29", "we will be be able to do and they are", "15:32", "anything we offer so like that ten years", "15:34", "so in ten years we're gonna have green", "15:36", "people if in if someone so yeah if", "15:39", "someone so chooses makes well they'll be", "15:41", "able to go back to normal car well if", "15:42", "it's it's a good question and if it's", "15:45", "with this kind of gene therapy and it's", "15:47", "a small number of genes probably but we", "15:51", "are messing with very complex systems", "15:53", "that we don't fully understand it and", "15:54", "that's why there's a lot of unknowns and", "15:55", "coming back to your point on regulation", "15:57", "that's why we I don't think we want a", "15:59", "total free-for-all or feel say hey I'm", "16:01", "gonna enter my own genes yeah and you", "16:03", "don't want some backyard hustler yeah", "16:06", "it's true lab it's true cuz that you're", "16:08", "saying about the Hulk yeah I mean I just", "16:10", "think that there are all kinds of yeah", "16:12", "we're humans were diverse any kind of", "16:13", "thing that you can think of there is a", "16:15", "range and there's you know crazy on the", "16:17", "left and crazy on the right and crazy on", "16:19", "the top so people are gonna want to do", "16:21", "things and the question is if with any", "16:23", "society what do we think is okay and", "16:26", "what do we think is not okay and and", "16:28", "maybe there should be some I

with", "16:50", "gills it's like I will like it see life", "16:53", "like the tattoo seemed like a good idea", "16:55", "yeah well we probably will yeah so you", "16:59", "think we're probably 50 years away from", "17:00", "that being a reality so I think that we", "17:03", "are we the genetic revolution has", "17:05", "already begun and it's going to", "17:07", "fundamentally change our lives

how they can say this", "17:32", "is a drug this isn't intervention that", "17:33", "will work for you we do that then we're", "17:36", "going to have to sequence everybody so", "17:38", "we're gonna have about two billion", "17:40", "people have had their whole genome", "17:41", "sequence within a within a decade and", "17:44", "then we're", "17:45", "to be able to compare what the genes say",

people", "20:03", "creating new life-forms what if you said", "20:05", "hey you are being irresponsible you're", "20:08", "just having sex and having a kid yeah I", "20:10", "know that's how your grandma did it we", "20:11", "don't do it that way in 2099 yeah I", "20:13", "think it's gonna be hard to do that in a", "20:15", "society like the United States but in a", "20:17", "country like

hundred thousand fertilized eggs", "25:27", "those are all your natural kids yeah and", "25:30", "then you would get the best of that and", "25:32", "then work on those exactly that's", "25:34", "exactly the model you get that and then", "25:36", "you say alright what if you had like", "25:38", "twenty sons that were awesome and they", "25:40", "didn't tell you about eighteen of them",

crazy stuff and that's coming back to", "25:59", "your earlier point about regulation is", "26:01", "we want to live in regulated", "26:03", "environments means so like now think of", "26:05", "the internet and you know in the", "26:06", "beginning days of the internet people", "26:07", "that I'll just let the internet be let", "26:10", "you know just let it play out it's gonna", "26:12",

yeah particularly China yeah", "26:51", "that's exactly right and so what we need", "26:53", "to do is to find that balance and one of", "26:56", "the big issues for this is privacy so if", "26:59", "you kind of look around the world I'd", "27:00", "say there's of the kind of the big", "27:01", "countries and groupings of countries", "27:03", "there's three models of privacy there's", "27:05",

affect", "28:08", "things like competitive athletics hugely", "28:11", "so right now we have this problem", "28:15", "someone like Lance Armstrong is who is", "28:16", "doing he's manipulating his his body and", "28:19", "what he's basically doing is adding more", "28:22", "red blood cells so that he can carry", "28:24", "more oxygen and people feel that that's", "28:27", "cheating and it's it's a different topic", "28:28", "that probably everybody in the Tour de", "28:30", "France was doing exactly that when he", "28:32", "when he won but what if it which will be", "28:35", "the case we're going to be able to", "28:37", "sequence the people let's say nobody's", "28:39", "doing drugs and we sequence all these", "28:41", "athletes some of them will just have a", "28:44", "natural genetic

"28:53", "now yeah well that female sprint yes has", "28:55", "high levels of tests yes yeah no and", "28:58", "it's Jenny I feel really sorry for her", "29:00", "yeah but we have categories I mean yeah", "29:02", "you with your world in mixed martial", "29:04", "arts I mean I think I remember in the", "29:06", "past there was some person who has who", "29:08", "was kind of a borderline on the head", "29:11", "between genders and was just kicking the", "29:13", "shit out of all of these women in cage", "29:16", "fighting it's like we have these", "29:18", "categories of man and woman we know that", "29:20", "the gender identities are our fluid but", "29:23", "how do we think about it when these", "29:25", "genetic differences confer advantages so", "29:28", "if your body is primed to do something", "29:33", "maybe you could have like a Plato's", "29:35", "Republic world where everybody that", "29:37", "fulfills a function that you are", "29:39", "genetically optimized to do and that you", "29:41", "could imagine that being a very", "29:42", "competitive kind of environment but what", "29:46", "do you do for now in something like the", "29:48", "Olympics if somebody has this huge", "29:49", "genetic advantage should we elect", "29:51", "somebody else manipulate their bodies", "29:53", "there's thing called gene doping mm-hmm", "29:55", "in order to change the expression of", "29:58", "gene so as your body to act like you're", "30:00", "as Jeanette naturally genetic enhanced", "30:02", "is somebody else it's complicated are", "30:04", "they capable of doing certain physical", "30:07", "enhancements through gene doping right", "30:09", "now yeah like what can they do right now", "30:11", "no no so the way it works is so your", "30:13", "genes instruct your cells to make", "30:16", "proteins that's that's its that's how", "30:19", "the whole system works so you can change", "30:21", "genes or you can trigger the expression", "30:25", "of proteins so you can get people's", "30:27", "bodies to behave as if they had the", "30:31", "these appreciated optimization yeah yeah", "30:34", "and so that's why now the the world", "30:36", "anti-doping agency I mean they are now", "30:38", "starting to look at gene doping and this", "30:41", "is the first time that that's that", "30:43", "that's even being considered as a", "30:45", "category and then there are have they're", "30:46", "people that have done that are there", "30:48", "people that have done that successfully", "30:49", "you know I don't know the answer to that", "30:51", "I know that wada is looking for it which", "30:54", "makes me assume that it must have done", "30:57", "but I haven't seen it I've looked for it", "30:58", "I haven't seen any reports and it starts", "31:00", "winning everything what China is so so", "31:02", "my my wrote my one of my sci-fi novels", "31:05", "Jenna", "31:05", "this code was about this so China as you", "31:07", "know has their system of their Olympic", "31:10", "sport schools and the way it works is", "31:11", "they test kids all around the country so", "31:14", "let's just say it's it's diving and they", "31:17", "identify what are the core skills of a", "31:19", "diver what do you need and then they go", "31:21", "around the country and they test kids", "31:23", "and then they bring a bunch of them to", "31:24", "the Olympic sport schools and then they", "31:27", "you know they get them all involved and", "31:29", "then some kids are the best of those", "31:30", "kids and then the best of those kids and", "31:32", "then you get with these champs that's", "31:33", "why China advanced so so rapidly but", "31:36", "what happens if they're doing that but", "31:39", "it's at the genetic level and there are", "31:41", "countries like Kazakhstan that are", "31:42", "already announcing that they are going", "31:44", "to be screening all of their athletes so", "31:46", "the science isn't there yet so it's", "31:48", "really it's impossible right now to say", "31:51", "I want me to do a genome sequence of", "31:52", "somebody and I know this person has the", "31:55", "potential to be an Olympic sprinter but", "31:57", "ten years from now that's not going to", "31:59", "be the case Wow yeah it's sort of gonna", "32:02", "throw a monkey wrench and the whole idea", "32:04", "of what is fair when it comes to", "32:06", "athletics yeah what is fair what is", "32:07", "human right what is human", "32:09", "yeah I mean look it's not like people", "32:12", "don't already alter their bodies by", "32:14", "training by diet exercise all sorts of", "32:18", "different recovery modality and", "32:20", "cryotherapy song all of it you know high", "32:25", "elevation training all these different", "32:27", "things that they do that manipulates the", "32:28", "human body but it's not like it would be", "32:33", "kind of crazy if you had sports but you", "32:35", "couldn't practice and you couldn't work", "32:36", "out like we want to find out what a", "32:38", "person's really like no practice no", "32:40", "working out that's and that's the thing", "32:42", "is like we are moving it comes back to", "32:45", "we were saying before about nature", "32:46", "mm-hmm it's like we have this this", "32:47", "feeling of nature somehow feels", "32:49", "comfortable to us that's what we're used", "32:52", "to all this stuff that you're talking", "32:53", "about it nobody was doing that ten", "32:55", "thousand years ago it's like I'm running", "32:57", "after a buffalo yeah and so and so as", "33:01", "these boundaries change as the realm of", "33:03", "possibility changes then we're going to", "33:07", "be faced with all of these questions", "33:09", "even now look at a sport like", "33:10", "competitive weightlifting they they have", "33:13", "these like the the real competitive", "33:16", "bodybuilding and you see these guys and", "33:18", "they", "33:19", "they're monsters and then they have", "33:20", "these drug free guys and everybody looks", "33:23", "like a yogi and it's still a pretty face", "33:26", "they like pretty big but not compared to", "33:28", "these other guys the only way to get", "33:30", "those freak levels steroids yeah", "33:33", "and so like how are we going to police", "33:36", "this and I think it's going to be very", "33:38", "difficult and so maybe we can have some", "33:40", "kind of natural area of life but I think", "33:43", "that our our model of what's normal is", "33:46", "just going to change cuz like I was", "33:48", "saying in the beginning we set our", "33:49", "baseline based on how we grew up and and", "33:52", "that it seems about right like it seems", "33:54", "about right to us that everybody gets", "33:56", "immunizations but immunizations are a", "33:59", "form of super power imagine if our", "34:01", "ancestor they couldn't even imagine", "34:02", "immunizations what an unfair advantage", "34:05", "when you have a hundred million people", "34:06", "dying of Spanish flu so we're with this", "34:09", "all this stuff is scary and it's going", "34:11", "to normalize but how it normalizes is is", "34:15", "that's what's it plane it well the world", "34:16", "has changed so much just in the last", "34:18", "twenty years but it feels like this is", "34:20", "just scratching the surface in", "34:21", "comparison to what's coming it was said", "34:23", "people miss understand and they", "34:27", "underestimate the rate of change and the", "34:30", "reason that they do that is since the", "34:32", "beginning of the digital revolution we", "34:34", "have experienced a thing called", "34:36", "exponential changes that you've heard of", "34:37", "Moore's law which is basically computing", "34:39", "power roughly doubles every two years", "34:41", "and we've internalized Moore's law and", "34:44", "that means that every new iPhone we", "34:46", "expect to be better and stronger and", "34:48", "faster and all these kinds of things but", "34:50", "now we're entering in a world where", "34:52", "we're going to have exponential change", "34:54", "across technology platforms and so we", "34:58", "think about well what is exponential", "35:00", "change mean in the context of biology", "35:02", "well at the very very beginning its", "35:04", "genome sequencing is is is going to be", "35:07", "basically basically free but we're going", "35:10", "to be able to change life and because", "35:13", "we're on this J curve like when you", "35:15", "think of what's a 10 year unit of change", "35:17", "looking in the in the rearview mirror", "35:18", "that amount of change is only going to", "35:20", "take five years going forward and then", "35:22", "two years and then one year and so", "35:24", "that's the reason why I've written this", "35:26", "book is I we have to get that this stuff", "35:29", "is coming fast and if we want to be part", "35:31", "of it we have to under", "35:32", "stand it and we have to make our voices", "35:34", "heard what makes you nervous about this", "35:38", "alright three big areas first humans and", "35:42", "all of us incredibly complex I may talk", "35:45", "about genetic code which is", "35:47", "mind-bogglingly complex but our genetics", "35:51", "exists within the incredible incredibly", "35:54", "complex systems biology we have all", "35:56", "these things like our microbiome our", "35:58", "viral more proteome our metabolomic", "36:01", "cysts within the context of our", "36:03", "environment and everything's always", "36:05", "changing and interacting and so we are", "36:07", "messing we have the tools to mess and we", "36:10", "will mess because we're this hubristic", "36:11", "species with these really complex", "36:14", "ecosystems including ourselves we don't", "36:17", "fully understand that's number one - and", "36:19", "you mention it before this issue of", "36:20", "equity what happens if we have every", "36:23", "technology has to have first adopters if", "36:26", "you don't have it you never get the", "36:27", "technology but what happens if a group", "36:29", "of people move much more quickly than", "36:31", "other people whether it's real or not", "36:32", "even if they believe it's real you could", "36:34", "imagine big dangerous societal changes", "36:36", "and the third big area is diversity we", "36:39", "think about diversity we think why it's", "36:40", "great to have diverse workplaces and", "36:42", "schools and and we're more better people", "36:45", "for it and we're more competitive but", "36:48", "diversity is something much much much", "36:50", "deeper in Darwinian terms diversity is", "36:53", "random mutation like that's our core", "36:55", "survival strategy as a species if we", "36:57", "didn't have that you could say we", "36:58", "distilled be single-cell organisms but", "37:00", "we wouldn't we would have died because", "37:02", "the environment would have changed and", "37:04", "we wouldn't have had the the built-in", "37:05", "resilience to add mmhmm yeah that is", "37:07", "really important when you think about", "37:09", "diversity right that we we need a non", "37:11", "uniformity when it comes to our own", "37:13", "biology yeah because need a bunch of", "37:15", "different kinds of people we have to", "37:16", "have it big as even if we optimized for", "37:18", "this world the world will change there's", "37:21", "no good and bad in evolution there's", "37:23", "just well-suited for a particular", "37:25", "environment if that environment changes", "37:27", "the best suited person for your old", "37:29", "environment may be the least suited", "37:31", "person for the new invited seemed real", "37:35", "like really great ideas now like", "37:37", "optimizing health so if you have sickle", "37:39", "cell disease you're probably going to", "37:42", "die and you're going to die young and", "37:43", "it's going to be excruciating people", "37:45", "excruciating pain", "37:46", "and so you would say well let's just get", "37:48", "rid of sickle-cell disease which we can", "37:50", "do but if you are a recessive carrier of", "37:54", "the single of the sickle-cell disease", "37:56", "gene you don't have it you're just", "37:58", "carrying it and you have a pretty", "38:00", "significant risk of passing it on to", "38:01", "your kids but you also have an", "38:04", "additional resistance to malaria and so", "38:07", "we are probably are almost certainly", "38:09", "carrying around all kinds of recessive", "38:12", "traits maybe even ones that we don't", "38:14", "like that are harming us now but it", "38:16", "could be some protection against some", "38:19", "future danger that we don't yet", "38:20", "understand or how or haven't faced and", "38:22", "so the challenge is that diversity has", "38:24", "just happened to us for four billion", "38:26", "years now we're going to have to choose", "38:28", "it and that's a big it's a big challenge", "38:31", "for us so essentially we're going to", "38:33", "have without doubt some unintended", "38:36", "consequences some unintended domino", "38:39", "effect things that are going to take", "38:41", "place that we really can't predict we", "38:45", "just have to kind of go along with this", "38:48", "technology and see where it leads us as", "38:50", "it improves well if you go back and look", "38:52", "at surgeries from the 1950s comparison", "38:54", "to the surgery of 2019 giant leaps I", "38:57", "mean I would never advise someone to get", "38:59", "their knee operated by a 1950s physician", "39:02", "yeah right but that's kind of someone's", "39:06", "gonna have to be an early adopter that", "39:07", "comes these genetic therapies", "39:09", "yeah no sigh I agree with you but where", "39:12", "I would slightly awry would add to what", "39:14", "you're saying is these technologies", "39:15", "they're going to happen they're going to", "39:17", "play out mmm what's it play now is not", "39:20", "whether these technologies are going to", "39:21", "advance they will it will do it they", "39:23", "will advance in a way that is going to", "39:25", "just blow people's minds hmm what's at", "39:27", "play is what are the values that we are", "39:30", "going to weave in to the decision-making", "39:32", "process so we can get a better outcome", "39:34", "than we otherwise would have had and", "39:36", "that that's what in my view that's the", "39:38", "real the important is you know yeah", "39:41", "unintended consequences are something", "39:44", "that I've been taking very seriously", "39:45", "lately when I'm paying attention to", "39:48", "technology as as its used in social", "39:51", "media yeah particularly I one one of the", "39:54", "things has disturbed me quite a bit over", "39:56", "the last few weeks is that there's a", "39:58", "model that", "40:00", "use and not intentionally but there's a", "40:02", "model that they use to get people upset", "40:04", "about things show you things in your", "40:07", "feed that you argue against because that", "40:11", "makes you click on them more and yet", "40:13", "engage in them more and because of the", "40:15", "fact that we have this advertiser based", "40:17", "model where people are trying to get", "40:19", "clicks because they want to get ads on", "40:22", "their page and the more clicks they get", "40:23", "the more money they get from those ads", "40:24", "and so they want to incentivize people", "40:27", "to go there and the best way through the", "40:29", "algorithm with what they've found", "40:30", "without doing it on purpose is to get", "40:32", "people upset yeah and they're pushing", "40:34", "people into these little information", "40:36", "ghettos that are really dangerous", "40:37", "right and we've gotten to this point", "40:39", "where this is just an accepted part of", "40:42", "our lives did you go to check your", "40:43", "Google feed or your Facebook feed and no", "40:45", "but what the fuck are they doing", "40:47", "is this real they're gonna pass this", "40:49", "goddamnit and then get mad and then you", "40:51", "engage with people online and then it", "40:54", "results in more revenue but getting them", "40:57", "to stop that if you had to go to", "40:59", "Facebook and say hey hey Mark Zuckerberg", "41:01", "err no you have fuckin a hundred billion", "41:03", "dollars or whatever you got but you", "41:04", "can't make any more money this way right", "41:06", "because what you're doing is fucking up", "41:07", "society because you're encouraging", "41:09", "dissent you encourage young people to be", "41:11", "upset and arguments and you're doing it", "41:14", "at great financial reward but great", "41:16", "societal cost yeah so stop yeah do it", "41:20", "right well he may not do that comes back", "41:21", "to the point about regulation did the", "41:23", "question is how big is your stick well", "41:24", "one of the guys who was the founder of", "41:26", "yes yes yes is now coming out and saying", "41:28", "my Facebook needs to be broken up and", "41:30", "then he was one of the original founders", "41:32", "and he's like it has gotten so far out", "41:34", "of hand it's so far away from where it", "41:36", "is it's literally affecting global", "41:38", "politics yeah well it is and so one", "41:41", "option is to break it up that it seems", "41:43", "to have worked pretty well with AT&T", "41:45", "another option is to regulate it which", "41:48", "is in my mind would be a better approach", "41:50", "and that is to say here's what's okay", "41:53", "and here's what's not okay and this", "41:55", "stuff is really intricate you have to", "41:57", "really get down beneath these algorithms", "42:00", "which are unbelievably complex but", "42:02", "you're exactly right I mean what we're", "42:03", "seeing now is we are being pushed into", "42:07", "information ghettos but it's like", "42:09", "information barricades and so pushed in", "42:11", "the camps yeah and so amber you are", "42:13", "so dangerous because the old minutes", "42:16", "this country is based on not everybody", "42:18", "agreeing but having a process where", "42:20", "people come and they work it out and", "42:22", "they say you know I'm not perfectly", "42:23", "happy with this outcome but here's a", "42:25", "compromise and if we can't compromise", "42:27", "then our civic culture is gonna break", "42:30", "down and there's so much I mean people", "42:31", "don't see these pillars that are holding", "42:33", "up our society I lived in Cambodia for", "42:35", "two years and if you don't have these", "42:36", "civic pillars under your society", "42:39", "societies look very very different", "42:41", "everyone's life experiences we we kind", "42:43", "of take for granted you can go out the", "42:44", "door walk to Starbucks and and not get", "42:47", "shot or you can you have your house", "42:50", "something half at your house gets robbed", "42:51", "you call the police and the police", "42:53", "aren't the ones who've robbed your house", "42:55", "or they're not in mean there's all these", "42:57", "kinds of crazy things if we break down", "42:59", "the foundations that underpin our lives", "43:02", "that's really dangerous what I was kind", "43:04", "of getting at was that through what this", "43:07", "this process of this algorithm how this", "43:10", "algorithm selects things that it chose", "43:12", "you in your feed and how people are", "43:13", "getting upset by this and how this is", "43:14", "generating massive amounts of revenue", "43:16", "once it's already happened it's very", "43:19", "difficult to stop and my concern would", "43:21", "be that this would be a similar thing", "43:23", "when it comes to genetic engineering", "43:25", "we're saying we need to be able to put", "43:27", "regulations on this we needed to be able", "43:29", "to establish but once it gets out of the", "43:32", "bag once it gets rolling and I have you", "43:35", "remember when Mark Zuckerberg sat in", "43:37", "front of all those politicians they had", "43:38", "no fucking idea what they were talking", "43:41", "about you make money and such piss-poor", "43:42", "prepares and it just it shows you like", "43:45", "these are the people that are looking", "43:46", "out for us good fucking luck these are", "43:47", "Luddites they're dumbasses they're fools", "43:50", "right and they're they don't know", "43:52", "anything about some are smarter and", "43:54", "worse but yeah almost everyone was", "43:57", "underwhelming and under impressive in", "44:00", "that hearing in that hearing yeah the", "44:01", "fact that they're dealing with one of", "44:02", "the most important moments of our time", "44:04", "but they didn't bring on some sort of a", "44:06", "like legitimate technology expert it", "44:09", "could explain it hit falls yes and do", "44:11", "some in a way that the rest of world's", "44:13", "can you know so they're not going to", "44:15", "protect us from genetic engineering", "44:16", "either right cuz they're not they're", "44:17", "trained generalists yeah but in terms of", "44:19", "their education for the most part and", "44:20", "they're not they're not concerned this", "44:22", "is not they're concerned with raising", "44:24", "money for their campaign the concern was", "44:25", "getting real act", "44:26", "that's their concern with yeah I totally", "44:28", "agree with you that if we wait to focus", "44:31", "on this issue until it becomes a crisis", "44:34", "it's going to be too late because all", "44:36", "the big decisions will have been made", "44:37", "the reason why I wrote this book the", "44:40", "reason why you know I'm on my almost", "44:43", "week three of this book tour doing", "44:45", "events like this every day is what I am", "44:47", "saying in every form that I can is this", "44:50", "is really important you kind of we were", "44:52", "watching the news yesterday they had", "44:53", "this royal baby in the UK like I don't", "44:57", "give a shit it doesn't affect my life in", "44:58", "any but what is it play now is the", "45:01", "future of our entire species and our", "45:03", "democracy in our lives and we have to be", "45:05", "focusing on those things because we have", "45:08", "a moment now where we can get to a", "45:11", "certain extent influence how these", "45:14", "revolutions play out and if we just wait", "45:16", "around if we're distracted and we're", "45:18", "focusing on all this stuff that's", "45:19", "sucking up our attention and whether", "45:21", "it's Trump or brexit or Muller and all", "45:24", "these things I mean we're spent how much", "45:25", "of our time are we spending focus on", "45:27", "this fine let's pay a little bit of", "45:28", "attention but there's really big stuff", "45:30", "50 years from now 100 years oh no one's", "45:33", "gonna look back and now so that was the", "45:34", "age of Trump that was know they're gonna", "45:36", "say that was the age when after almost", "45:39", "four billion years of evolution humans", "45:41", "took control of their own evolutionary", "45:42", "process and it's huge and it's gonna", "45:44", "change all of life and what I'm trying", "45:46", "to do is to say everybody has to have a", "45:49", "seat at the table whether you're a", "45:51", "conservative Christian whether you're a", "45:54", "biohacking transhumanist everybody needs", "45:58", "to be at the the table because we're", "46:00", "talking about is the future of our", "46:01", "species we're talking about the future",

"46:11", "like I'm talking about it right I mean", "46:14", "if someone said hey you've got to go", "46:15", "speak in front of people about the", "46:17", "consequences right and in a very clear", "46:19", "yeah one-hour presentation I'd be like", "46:21", "no I'm not well know what I'm talking", "46:23", "about", "46:23", "one we can go together so you're good", "46:25", "thank you but to the reason why I've", "46:27", "written this book hacking Darwin is I", "46:29", "wanted to say if you could read just one", "46:30", "book and it's written just for everybody", "46:33", "in a very clear way with a lot of jokes", "46:35", "that I think are funny my mother laughed", "46:37", "at them as well that you get it", "46:39", "and then once you know just the basics", "46:41", "as a human being anybody it has an equal", "46:45", "right to be part of this of this", "46:47", "conversation as the top scientist or the", "46:50", "the leaders of any of any countries I", "46:52", "would agree with you there but I don't", "46:53", "think that other people are going to see", "46:55", "it that way", "46:56", "I think the people that are in control", "46:57", "they're not gonna say hey we need to", "46:58", "find we need to be fair with everyone", "47:00", "all the citizens the world how do you", "47:02", "feel we should proceed no but that's why", "47:04", "we have to that's why we need this", "47:05", "bottom-up groundswell but we can't have", "47:08", "a bottom-up groundswell if people if", "47:10", "just general people aren't even aware of", "47:12", "what the issues are and that's and", "47:14", "that's the challenge and that's why", "47:15", "forums like yours are just so important", "47:18", "I mean you have all of these people and", "47:20", "then you maybe everyone doesn't listen", "47:22", "to this podcast say all right I get it I", "47:24", "can go give that hour-long speech but", "47:26", "you can read a couple books and then you", "47:28", "can give an an hour speech because the", "47:30", "issues like yes there are scientific", "47:33", "issues but this isn't a conversation", "47:35", "about science this is about values and", "47:37", "ethics in our future

is", "49:56", "interfering that's going too far and I", "49:58", "respect that and those people need to", "50:01", "have a seat at the table and that's and", "50:04", "there's certainly very strong

diverse we are going to have", "50:31", "this level of diversity and the", "50:34", "challenge is how do we make how do we", "50:37", "have a process that brings brings", "50:38", "everybody in but it's it's tough so when", "50:41", "we're talking about genetic any sort of", "50:44", "genetic manipulation we're basically", "50:46", "talking about doing stuff to the wet", "50:48", "we're doing stuff to the biology right", "50:51", "what do you think about symbiotic", "50:54", "interactions and Technology because I", "50:56", "think one of the things that I'm", "50:57", "concerned with more than anything is", "50:59", "this sort of inevitable path of", "51:03", "Technology getting into our bodies", "51:04", "whether it's through nano by", "51:07", "significant ation we were talking", "51:09", "yesterday about chips right like what", "51:11", "would they have to do to get you to get", "51:13", "it put a chip in your body like what and", "51:15", "what kind of powers would it have to", "51:16", "have before you accepted it yeah well", "51:18", "people already doing it in Sweden and so", "51:20", "are they doing in Sweden yeah they're", "51:22", "just they're putting this little chips", "51:23", "in their hands and they're and under", "51:24", "their skin and they're using it to open", "51:26", "doors and access things so it's just", "51:28", "starting so I definitely believe you", "51:31", "know right now you look at we look at", "51:32", "photographs of our parents and you say", "51:34", "God look at your hair your clothes", "51:36", "that's crazy definitely I think that you", "51:39", "know 20 years from now 30 years now", "51:41", "people are gonna look at pictures of us", "51:42", "and say what's that little rectangular", "51:44", "thing and you're gonna say that was a", "51:46", "phone what and they'll say watch it's", "51:48", "like yeah we used to carry it around in", "51:50", "our pocket and like Michael Douglas when", "51:52", "you watch him in that movie Wall Street", "51:53", "he's got that giant exactly so we are", "51:57", "the earth we are all we are all Michael", "52:00", "Douglas because our technology your", "52:02", "absolute right is not

well are", "52:12", "you what what is human genetic", "52:14", "engineering have to do when we know that", "52:16", "AI is going to get more and more", "52:18", "powerful but the future of

going to regulate it what are", "52:38", "we going to have guardrails of how far", "52:40", "is too far are we going to let companies", "52:42", "just do whatever they want or we're", "52:44", "going to put restrictions on what they", "52:46", "can do I think letting the whole world", "52:47", "decide though you're gonna run into", "52:49", "those religious roadblocks if for sure", "52:51", "and that's and that's the challenge is", "52:53", "that the science is advancing", "52:56", "exponentially whatever we do and so we", "52:59", "have to have our understanding of the", "53:02", "science

to put limits on the far ends of", "53:23", "what's possible and it's it's really", "53:25", "really difficult but that's why we need", "53:28", "to have this kind of process and it", "53:29", "seems impossibly ambitious but every", "53:32", "crazy idea has to begin somewhere so", "53:34", "you're doing every couple months yeah", "53:37", "yes Wow yeah because they did want to be", "53:40", "on top of it as things change well", "53:42", "that's the goal it's just it's so hard", "53:45", "because almost impossible it's", "53:47", "impossible it's impossible and that's", "53:48", "why even the World Health Organization", "53:50", "which is the lead Health Organization of", "53:52", "the United Nations it's not enough", "53:54", "the task is so much bigger and that's", "53:58", "why we need to have this kind of grant", "54:00", "bottom-up groundswell that I'm pushing", "54:02", "for and you're absolutely right what you", "54:03", "said before like because there's not a", "54:05", "crisis people are focusing on other", "54:07", "things open any news site like what do", "54:10", "you see it's not like the really", "54:12", "important stuff it's you know Trump did", "54:14", "this or Kardashian's did that and like", "54:17", "we're in this culture where there are a", "54:18", "lot of draws on our attention but", "54:20", "sometimes there's really important stuff", "54:22", "and people are afraid of it people are", "54:24", "afraid of science people feel like I", "54:25", "remember science from high school I", "54:26", "didn't like it I was uncomfortable um", "54:29", "you know this is this is for technical", "54:32", "people and I just feel like we can't", "54:33", "science is so deeply transforming the", "54:36", "world not just around us but within us", "54:39", "and so we have to understand it and then", "54:42", "people who are explaining science like", "54:44", "me the onus is on us like if somebody", "54:46", "reads my book and says well that was", "54:48", "really dense that was too hard", "54:50", "like that's my failure like I was giving", "54:53", "a talk in New York a couple of a couple", "54:56", "of weeks ago and so I gave my my talk", "54:58", "and I try to make this really accessible", "55:00", "for people people are all jazzed up they", "55:02", "got it and then there was this wonderful", "55:04", "guys brilliant senior scientist at this", "55:06", "MIT this major", "55:08", "stem cell research center and so the", "55:10", "host said all right Jamie just talked", "55:13", "can you sign can you give us a little", "55:16", "background on the science this guy knows", "55:17", "so much and he started going it was very", "55:20", "technical and you could just like it to", "55:22", "see the faces of the people in the", "55:24", "audience it was like oh god what's", "55:25", "happening here and it's like their level", "55:27", "of excitement it's just shrunk because", "55:29", "it couldn't really put it all", "55:31", "yeah and so and scientists scientists", "55:34", "aren't trained by and large to", "55:37", "communicate and to see in the future is", "55:39", "so a little more than a month ago I was", "55:40", "in Kyoto and in Japan and I went to the", "55:43", "laboratory of the world's leading", "55:46", "scientists who's doing a process of what", "55:48", "I've mentioned earlier of turning adult", "55:50", "cells into stem cells into eggs and so", "55:53", "this this will revolutionize the way", "55:56", "humans reproduce and so I had was in a", "55:58", "meeting and with his top postdocs suits", "56:01", "so these are like really the cutting", "56:03", "edge of these technologies and I went", "56:04", "around to each of them and I said here's", "56:06", "my question have two questions for each", "56:07", "of you one tell me what you're doing now", "56:09", "and - tell me what are the implications", "56:12", "of what you're doing now for 50 years", "56:14", "from now and for the first question", "56:17", "because oh I'm doing this and we're", "56:19", "doing this with mouse models and people", "56:20", "were so animated and then 50 years but", "56:23", "now people just froze and it was so", "56:25", "uncomfortable just because that's not", "56:29", "what scientists do they are trained to", "56:31", "say well this is the thing just in front", "56:32", "of me so Ron I thought I was writing", "56:34", "this book for the general public but I'm", "56:36", "being invited to speak to thousands of", "56:38", "doctors and scientists because what", "56:40", "they're saying is we get that we're", "56:42", "doing this little piece of this and", "56:44", "whether it's lab research or fertility", "56:46", "doctors or all sorts of things but it's", "56:49", "really hard to put together the whole", "56:51", "story of the genetics revolution and", "56:53", "what it means for us and for society", "56:54", "yeah that is interesting about", "56:58", "scientists right they're just", "56:59", "concentrate on the task at hand yeah I", "57:01", "mean it wasn't that that was like one of", "57:03", "the big concerns about the Manhattan", "57:05", "Project right this is the task the task", "57:07", "is how do you out how to do it so they", "57:08", "figure out how to do it not the eventual", "57:12", "yes so when robert Oppenheimer who was", "57:16", "the the lead of the Manhattan Project", "57:18", "when that first bomb went off I mean he", "57:20", "has his his famous quote yeah exactly I", "57:24", "mean the English common translation was", "57:27", "holy shit what have we done yeah and and", "57:30", "that's and this science is real but it's", "57:33", "not going to be it's not one person", "57:35", "doing it I mean that's the whole like", "57:37", "science has been diffused at least with", "57:40", "with nuclear power it was a relatively", "57:42", "small number of people and it", "57:44", "was a one or two states that could do it", "57:47", "now with with precision gene editing I", "57:50", "mean you get the Nobel Prize for for", "57:53", "figuring out how to do you will get the", "57:55", "Nobel Prize for figuring out how to do", "57:57", "CRISPR gene edits but to apply it once", "58:01", "the formula already exists you get like", "58:04", "an a-minus in your high school biology", "58:06", "class so this technology is out there", "58:09", "it's cheap its accessible did you go to", "58:12", "that 2045 conference in Manhattan a", "58:15", "couple years back now do you know about", "58:17", "all that", "58:18", "20:44 that's that's part of the thing", "58:21", "with these transhumanists folks they", "58:23", "believe that with their own calculations", "58:25", "of the exponential in technology that's", "58:28", "somewhere around 2040 a singularity yeah", "58:30", "yeah yeah at the very least we're gonna", "58:32", "reach this point where you're gonna be", "58:34", "able to either download consciousness or", "58:37", "have some sort of an artificially", "58:39", "intelligent sentient writing it's", "58:40", "hanging out with you yeah so so I'm", "58:42", "involved I'm on faculty for one of the", "58:45", "programs of singularity University", "58:47", "called exponential medicine and so we're", "58:49", "thinking a lot about that actually had", "58:50", "an editor on the New York Times a few", "58:53", "weeks ago imagining a visit to a", "58:55", "fertility clinic in the year 2045 and", "58:57", "again because we were on this", "58:59", "exponential change it's really hard for", "59:03", "people to to internalize to kind of feel", "59:05", "how fast these changes are coming I do", "59:08", "think though Ray Kurzweil who's a really", "59:10", "incredible genius he thinks that we are", "59:13", "soon going to get to a point now where", "59:15", "our artificial intelligence is self", "59:17", "learning because when you think about it", "59:19", "AI if it gets to the point where it can", "59:21", "read something read and comprehend like", "59:24", "in seconds it will read every book ever", "59:27", "written in human history and then it's", "59:30", "just you have all these doublings and", "59:33", "all this more knowledge you can imagine", "59:34", "how that would happen pretty quickly", "59:35", "the counter-argument against and I think", "59:38", "that it will but I don't think that", "59:40", "where that our human brains are on one", "59:43", "hand they're incredibly complex and", "59:45", "they're also kind of irrational I mean", "59:47", "we have all these different layers you", "59:48", "have our lizard brain and every decision", "59:50", "that we make there's the rational", "59:51", "decision but then there's all the other", "59:53", "stuff that our brains that doesn't even", "59:55", "rise to the level of our awareness that", "59:57", "our", "59:57", "that our brains are processing and right", "60:00", "now we don't really have one really", "60:03", "effective artificial intelligence", "60:05", "algorithm which is for pattern", "60:06", "recognition but you think if you think", "60:08", "of pattern recognition as a core skill", "60:09", "of what our brains do our brains", "60:10", "probably have a thousand 2000 different", "60:13", "skills but the core thing is whether we", "60:17", "reach this singularity moment or not", "60:19", "these technologies are going to become", "60:21", "incredibly more powerful they're going", "60:23", "to become increasingly integrated into", "60:26", "our lives and into our beings and part", "60:29", "of our evolutionary process there's no", "60:30", "longer oh we just have our biological", "60:32", "evolution and our technological", "60:34", "evolution and those are separate things", "60:35", "they're connected it's going to be that", "60:37", "weird question of whether or not if an", "60:39", "artificial intelligence is going to be", "60:41", "able to absorb all the writing that", "60:43", "human beings have ever done and really", "60:45", "understand us yeah", "60:46", "will they really still be able to", "60:47", "understand us just because they get all", "60:49", "the writing so right now", "60:51", "you would say no I would say no yeah but", "60:53", "20 years from now 50 years or 100 years", "60:56", "from now they could come up with a", "60:57", "reasonable facsimile I mean yeah they", "61:00", "could figure out a way to get it close", "61:02", "enough yeah I know where it's like her", "61:04", "like that yeah yeah that's it it's an", "61:07", "essential point because I think when", "61:08", "people imagine this AI future they're", "61:11", "imagining like some intimate", "61:12", "relationship with some artificial", "61:15", "intelligent intelligent that feels just", "61:16", "like a human I don't think that's going", "61:18", "to happen because it's it don't", "61:19", "well no but just because AI it will be", "61:21", "its own form of intelligence and it may", "61:24", "not be frankly you wouldn't want a eyes", "61:26", "with these brains like we have that have", "61:28", "all these different impulses that are", "61:30", "kind of imagining all this this crazy", "61:32", "stuff we're we may want them to be more", "61:34", "rational than we are so like you", "61:37", "chimpanzees or our close relatives they", "61:39", "don't think just like us we're not you", "61:41", "know we're not expecting them to think", "61:43", "like they're their own thing and I think", "61:44", "a eyes will be their own things will we", "61:46", "be interacting with them will we be", "61:48", "having sex with them yes but if they are", "61:51", "there it's not going to be that they're", "61:52", "just like us we're going to they're", "61:54", "going to be these things that live", "61:56", "within us live with us and together", "61:59", "we're going to evolve well they're", "62:01", "certainly already better at doing", "62:03", "certain things like playing chess yeah", "62:05", "it took a long time for an artificial", "62:07", "intelligence to be able to compete", "62:09", "against a real chess match open", "62:10", "they swamped them yeah so say learn", "62:12", "quickly like incredibly quickly they", "62:15", "teach themselves yeah so so first we had", "62:18", "chess and chess people said oh that's", "62:20", "what it means to be a human the", "62:22", "computers will never beat humans at just", "62:24", "now it's like everyone says well no", "62:26", "human could ever compete and then they", "62:28", "said well there's this Chinese game of", "62:30", "Go which kind of when people here look", "62:31", "at it looks kind of like checkers but", "62:33", "it's actually way more sophisticated way", "62:35", "more complicated than chess I heard that", "62:37", "there are more moves and go more", "62:40", "potential moves and there are stars in", "62:42", "the US yes so so then they had alphago", "62:45", "that this with this company deep mind", "62:48", "which the was later acquired by google", "62:50", "they built this algorithm that in 2016", "62:53", "defeated the world champions of go", "62:56", "people thought that was we were decades", "62:57", "away and then deepmind created this new", "63:01", "program called alpha 0 and alpha 0 with", "63:04", "alphago they gave it access to all of", "63:06", "the digitized games of go so it very", "63:10", "quickly was able to learn from how", "63:12", "everybody else had played go alpha zero", "63:15", "they just said here are the basic rules", "63:17", "of go and they let alpha go just play", "63:20", "against itself with no other experience", "63:23", "other than here are the rules and play", "63:24", "against in in four days alpha zero", "63:28", "destroyed alphago and then alpha and net", "63:32", "alpha zero destroyed the world champions", "63:37", "of chess and destroyed every other", "63:39", "computer program that had ever played", "63:41", "chess and this again those computer", "63:43", "programs had internalized all the chess", "63:45", "games of grandmasters alpha zero had not", "63:48", "internalized any it just played against", "63:50", "itself for a few days and then shogi", "63:52", "which is a Japanese traditional game", "63:54", "kind of like chess it destroyed the", "63:56", "grandmasters of that so that's what I'm", "63:59", "saying is that these the world is", "64:01", "changing its changing so much faster", "64:03", "than we anticipate and we have to be as", "64:06", "ready for that as we can I think we need", "64:09", "to come to grips the fact that we're way", "64:10", "stupider than we think who are we what", "64:12", "we think we're really intelligent and we", "64:14", "are in comparison to everything else on", "64:16", "this planet yeah but in comparison to", "64:18", "what is possible we are really fucking", "64:21", "dumb in comparison to what this computer", "64:22", "can do and what", "64:24", "the future of that computers and what", "64:26", "maybe that computers gonna read is on", "64:27", "another computer yeah this is good but", "64:29", "I've got some I got some hiccups here", "64:31", "yeah no it's true and yet the technology", "64:33", "is us right like this these not like", "64:35", "this technology some alien force we've", "64:37", "it's like this it's like we create art", "64:39", "we collect we could yeah you use that", "64:42", "you mentioned cities and our like we", "64:43", "create these cities which are these", "64:45", "incredible places where dreams can", "64:47", "happen 'no city is like here in Los", "64:49", "Angeles or New York where where we're on", "64:51", "from so this technology is us and the", "64:53", "challenge is how can we make sure that", "64:55", "this technology serves our needs rather", "64:59", "than undermines our needs yeah and", "65:02", "whether or not our needs supersede the", "65:04", "needs of the human race or supersedes", "65:07", "the needs of the planet yeah it's we're", "65:11", "almost too much chimp right to", "65:14", "contemplate these yeah critical", "65:15", "decisions in terms of like what how it's", "65:18", "going to unfold from here on out yeah we", "65:20", "really might not we but the people that", "65:23", "are actually at the tip of the spear of", "65:24", "this stuff they really might be", "65:26", "affecting the way the planet is shaped", "65:30", "answers from now and we're doing that", "65:32", "now I mean we are there is an article", "65:34", "came out the other day there's a million", "65:36", "species that are on the verge of", "65:38", "extinction we are deriving all these", "65:39", "other species to extinction we're", "65:40", "warming the the planet so this is humans", "65:43", "are the the determining factor in many", "65:46", "ways for how this planet plays out and", "65:48", "that's why in my mind everything comes", "65:50", "back to vows we you're right we have", "65:52", "this this lizard nature this this monkey", "65:56", "nature it's it's who we are and that's I", "65:58", "mean you wouldn't want to take that away", "65:59", "because that's the core of what we are", "66:02", "and yet we're also a species that has", "66:04", "created philosophy we've created", "66:06", "beautiful religions and traditions and", "66:08", "art and the question is which version of", "66:12", "us is going to lead us into the future", "66:16", "if it's this you know tribal primate", "66:19", "with these urges like that's really", "66:21", "frightening

was so mmm attempt I we", "73:47", "started the interview talking about my", "73:49", "chocolate shamanism you ever done", "73:51", "anything I haven't in but I was realize", "73:54", "I want to I don't think so and I'll tell", "73:57", "you why so I listened to the Michael", "74:00", "Palin interviews and he had his great", "74:01", "conversation with Sam Harris and I", "74:04", "really think that this psilocybin stuff", "74:06", "is is real and just got decriminalize", "74:09", "ever I was just there the other day but", "74:12", "as I said before I think that the", "74:15", "ultimate drug is us and so for me I", "74:19", "would rather and I definitely think that", "74:21", "our awareness that doesn't encompass", "74:24", "everything that is knowable everything", "74:26", "that we that we could know but we hem", "74:28", "ourselves in and if we want to get out", "74:30", "of those limitations certainly drugs are", "74:34", "ways that have people have used for for", "74:36", "many thousands of years but when you", "74:39", "take the drug you're like taking the", "74:41", "drug and you're not taking the drug like", "74:42", "I would rather what does that mean it's", "74:44", "like if you're taking psilocybin you're", "74:47", "having this great experience but then", "74:49", "tomorrow you're not taking psilocybin", "74:50", "and so kind of your consciousness has", "74:52", "narrow my aspiration would be to", "74:54", "recognize that the drug is us then we", "74:58", "want to expand our consciousness there", "75:00", "are all kinds of ways whether it's", "75:01", "meditation or awareness or just you know", "75:04", "simple appreciation that's when I do", "75:06", "these cacao ceremonies what I say is", "75:08", "like you have this cacao in front of you", "75:10", "but it's not just this like think of the", "75:13", "person in Honduras who planted the seed", "75:16", "the person who watered that see the", "75:18", "person who took the plant the person who", "75:20", "paved the road to bring the plant and I", "75:23", "just I just think that we can expand our", "75:25", "consciousness through our own means we", "75:28", "always have access I hear what you're", "75:29", "saying but you're saying this from a", "75:31", "person that's never has", "75:32", "experience it's generally preposterous", "75:34", "if you did experience what psilocybin", "75:37", "can do to you yeah you definitely", "75:39", "wouldn't be saying it this way you also", "75:41", "wouldn't be thinking then you take it", "75:43", "and then you're not on it anymore", "75:44", "because it's profoundly influential for", "75:47", "the your perspective in regards to the", "75:49", "whole rest of your existence there's", "75:51", "many people that have had psychedelic", "75:53", "experiences that think about it as a", "75:55", "rebirth yeah that they've gone through", "75:57", "this and changed yeah so but why would", "76:00", "you have this rigid thought process", "76:02", "about drugs and not drugs yeah but yet", "76:05", "you don't have it about cow which is a", "76:07", "mild drug yeah and so I you're right", "76:10", "that it may not be entirely consistent", "76:12", "some of the people you've described are", "76:13", "good friends of mine who've really done", "76:15", "it and I've really I've talked to them", "76:17", "about it and I'm humming endlessly", "76:18", "curious so why don't you do it the", "76:22", "reason is so far I have been on this", "76:25", "journey to see what's possible within", "76:28", "myself and I'm still on that journey I'm", "76:31", "not I don't to close off any possibility", "76:33", "for I assume that it would close things", "76:35", "off that's what's confusing yeah it's", "76:37", "just opening you up to a new experience", "76:40", "that other people have found to be", "76:41", "profoundly influential yeah yeah so so", "76:45", "far you're very resistant to this like", "76:47", "yeah I'm talking you yeah yeah you can't", "76:50", "wait to come your own rational your", "76:52", "right back from that perspective of a", "76:55", "person who hasn't experienced any of", "76:57", "them you're so right and just that vague", "76:59", "is it such a great point because I'm", "77:00", "very close with actually that with the", "77:01", "Tibetans", "77:02", "one of my closest friends is the Prime", "77:04", "Minister of the Tibetan exile government", "77:06", "so I've been many times to John Salah in", "77:08", "India I've met with His Holiness the", "77:11", "Dalai Lama many times and the most", "77:13", "incredible thing about meeting with", "77:16", "these guys and they they are all people", "77:18", "who found these incredible states of", "77:21", "heightened consciousness so much that", "77:23", "their brains are changed when they go", "77:26", "into the the fMRI machines but when you", "77:29", "have a conversation with them it's not", "77:31", "like what we do like exactly and thank", "77:33", "you for calling me out like you say", "77:34", "something", "77:34", "I've already in my head countered what", "77:36", "you're saying before you're finished", "77:37", "saying and not why you kept saying", "77:39", "exactly yes I which means you made me", "77:41", "uncut a little uncomfortable it is good", "77:43", "that's what we want and these guys it's", "77:45", "like you talked", "77:46", "and they would just be so tuned in to", "77:49", "what you were saying and they would just", "77:50", "kind of think about then you'd finish", "77:52", "and then they'd kind of look up and then", "77:55", "because we're Americans we want you know", "77:57", "somebody stops speaking like you have to", "78:00", "if you don't speak right away and then", "78:02", "they would like a minute and then it's", "78:04", "like you're kind of looking around was", "78:06", "it me I say so and then they would come", "78:09", "back with this incredibly thoughtful", "78:10", "thing so I you're right you know I don't", "78:12", "want to close off any possibility there", "78:15", "are many different things that we could", "78:16", "could do the path that I have been on", "78:19", "and certainly with this cacao and you", "78:21", "write cacao is like a mild I mean not a", "78:24", "huge one but like a mild dragon life is", "78:28", "a mild drug so Simon's not very mild", "78:31", "yeah knowing my friends who have done it", "78:33", "have said exactly what he said they say", "78:35", "I have a good friend of mine who who did", "78:38", "it and then he said it just it showed me", "78:41", "a path to a different identity a", "78:44", "different consciousness and now he said", "78:46", "I don't do psilocybin but I do daily", "78:49", "meditation but I can see where I'd like", "78:52", "to go what's possible so I get there", "78:54", "yeah yeah there's a bunch of different", "78:56", "substances out there that have very", "78:59", "similar profound effects there's a real", "79:03", "thought and this is something that", "79:06", "Terence Mckenna described way back in", "79:09", "the late 90s early 2000s he believed", "79:12", "that you're going to be able to recreate", "79:14", "a lot of psychedelic States through", "79:17", "virtual reality so that people that", "79:19", "don't want to actually do a drug will be", "79:22", "able to experience what it's like to be", "79:23", "on that drug and that I mean that's it's", "79:27", "very theoretical and hypothetical and", "79:30", "yes you know who knows whether or not", "79:32", "that's possible but that that could be", "79:35", "one other way that human beings", "79:37", "interface with technology so humans in", "79:40", "my view are far more hackable than we", "79:43", "think", "79:43", "mmm that that there are so many that we", "79:46", "just imagine our biology as being fixed", "79:49", "but our biology is really variable like", "79:51", "I have a friend who's an", "79:54", "anesthesiologist at Stanford and she's", "79:56", "done this experimentation of just", "79:58", "running just like very mild electric", "80:00", "currents through people's brains and", "80:01", "people have these very real experiences", "80:05", "and whether it's arousal or something", "80:07", "that it's that you're you're entering", "80:09", "people's minds through different ways so", "80:11", "you talk about that virtual reality we", "80:14", "are entering a world where the", "80:16", "pixelation of virtual reality will be", "80:18", "equal to life hmm", "80:20", "and that so you're going to be in this", "80:21", "VR space and it says it will look it may", "80:25", "smell it could Eve with haptic suits it", "80:27", "may feel just like life yeah and our", "80:30", "brains I don't know if you've done these", "80:32", "things with these these VR glasses where", "80:36", "you go and you you you can see people", "80:39", "you're just like in a in a hall and you", "80:41", "put on the glasses and now you're in an", "80:43", "elevator going to the top now on the", "80:46", "outside like a window cleaners elevator", "80:48", "to the top of this high-rise and there's", "80:51", "a little rickety board and then there's", "80:53", "this cat at the end of the board and", "80:56", "they're saying yeah you have to go go", "80:57", "save the cat and you've already seen", "81:00", "that you're just in a hall you know it", "81:02", "in your brain there's this cat", "81:05", "everybody's looking at you and you've", "81:07", "seen all these other people panic in", "81:09", "fact when I'm there I'm gonna be so I'm", "81:11", "gonna go grab that cat and you're", "81:12", "terrified like you're trying to override", "81:15", "your lizard brain and your lizard brain", "81:16", "saying like no don't step just have that", "81:19", "for our HTC vive yeah yeah we need to", "81:22", "set that up Jim we need yeah a", "81:23", "two-by-four yeah put on the ground it's", "81:26", "incredible and so I think that this", "81:27", "whole concept of reality is that art our", "81:31", "technology is going to be changing our", "81:33", "sense of reality and then what's real", "81:35", "like if you feel arousal in your brain", "81:39", "because of an electric current or you", "81:40", "feel it because you're with your", "81:42", "girlfriend or wife or reading a magazine", "81:45", "or whatever is that different is one", "81:47", "real and one not real and I think that", "81:50", "this there's real big issues here", "81:52", "jamming that is the matrix right yeah I", "81:55", "mean the idea that and if it feels", "81:57", "better and it's more enjoyable than real", "81:59", "life what is gonna stop people from", "82:01", "doing the Ray Kurzweil deal and", "82:04", "downloading yourself into this this", "82:06", "dimension well not much you know whether", "82:09", "it's possible to do a full download or", "82:11", "not for me I think that's an open", "82:13", "but whether people are going to be more", "82:16", "comfortable living in these alternative", "82:18", "worlds mhm and whether we're going to be", "82:21", "able to say oh no that is the fake world", "82:22", "like if you're in this virtual world", "82:25", "right but you're do you have friends in", "82:27", "that world you're interacting in that", "82:29", "world you have experiences to feel every", "82:31", "bit as real in that world as in our", "82:34", "world and people say oh no that's not", "82:37", "real those those aren't your friends", "82:39", "like even now like you know we all", "82:40", "people with global lives you kind of", "82:42", "have these friends like I have a good", "82:44", "friend in Mongolia we talk all the time", "82:46", "do you ever see them in person once in a", "82:49", "while like once every year or two it's", "82:50", "great to see them that's a real person", "82:52", "though no it's a real that's someone", "82:53", "like you actually do know but if it was", "82:58", "someone that you only talk to online and", "83:00", "they lived on Joey that's where things", "83:01", "get weird it's true but let's just say", "83:03", "I've been following that hypothetical", "83:04", "you have that person they're part of", "83:06", "your whole life mm-hmm and you're there", "83:09", "with you they're they with you through", "83:11", "your life experiences you call them up", "83:13", "when you're sad like is it so essential", "83:16", "that you've met that person physically", "83:19", "like is that the core of what it means", "83:22", "to be someone's friend that you it's not", "83:23", "essential but it means a lot it does and", "83:25", "I and so I mean because we are not like", "83:29", "we are these physical beings and we are", "83:32", "these virtual beings but figuring out", "83:36", "what's the balance is gonna be really", "83:37", "tricky yeah what is the balance like", "83:39", "what I'm worried about", "83:41", "augmented reality too cuz I you know", "83:44", "when you see people that use snapchat", "83:45", "filters and give themselves dog ears and", "83:48", "stuff like that like yeah how long", "83:50", "before that is just something that", "83:52", "people choose to turn on or turn off", "83:54", "about life itself", "83:56", "yeah like you'll be able to see the", "83:57", "world

they were", "84:36", "getting filmed do they were yeah I mean", "84:38", "they were when you're walking around", "84:40", "with Google glasses on you assumed that", "84:41", "people were recording everything was", "84:43", "very strange they were but I think", "84:44", "that's another thing that we're just all", "84:46", "of our lives are going to be recorded of", "84:48", "course", "84:48", "now do you think that that's gonna come", "84:50", "in the form of a contact lens or do you", "84:52", "think it's gonna come in the form of", "84:54", "like ski goggles that you're gonna put", "84:56", "on nobody wants to look like an idiot", "84:58", "and so in the beginning true", "85:00", "nobody in the beginning all these you", "85:02", "talked about Michael Douglas with this", "85:03",

happen some of it some of", "86:07", "it will take some of it won't right yeah", "86:09", "right yeah it seems like that's what", "86:11", "we're gonna have to say like how it", "86:12", "plays out and that's one of the things", "86:14", "when you're talking about scientists", "86:15", "that are working on these things they're", "86:17", "working on what's right in front of them", "86:18",

the future what you do so", "86:35", "well certainly and we need to have a mix", "86:37", "of different kinds of people and so I", "86:40", "certainly people like me who were kind", "86:42", "of big picture futurists we need that we", "86:45", "need scientists I work with some really", "86:47", "incredible sign I did an event at", "86:49", "Harvard last week with George church", "86:50", "who's

myself", "87:17", "in that category people like you've all", "87:19", "know a Harare it was just kind of big", "87:21", "also kind of big thinkers people like", "87:23", "Sid Mukherjee and I just think we have", "87:26", "to articulate the big picture and we", "87:29", "have to do it in a way so that people", "87:31", "can see themselves in this story and", "87:34", "then and then enter into the", "87:37", "conversation are you writing this book", "87:39", "just to sort of educate people and let", "87:43", "them understand exactly what is going on", "87:45", "and that it is a really

what was the", "87:59", "motivation behind it was it for a person", "88:02", "like me or was it for the everyone like", "88:04", "it's for for everyone and so that what I", "88:06", "really wanted to so the background is", "88:08", "gonna give I can give you just a little", "88:09", "bit of Zorah", "88:10", "so more than 20 years ago I was working", "88:12", "on the National Security Council and my", "88:14", "then boss Richard Clarke who was then", "88:17", "this obscure White House official who", "88:20", "was jumping up and down saying we need", "88:21", "to be focusing on terrorism and al

was on", "88:34", "George Bush's desk saying exactly that", "88:37", "we need to focus on al Qaeda here's", "88:38", "what's going to happen you and Dick even", "88:40", "before then would always tell me that if", "88:42", "everyone in Washington was focusing on", "88:43", "one thing you could be sure there was", "88:45", "something much more important that was", "88:46", "being missed and so more than 20 years", "88:48", "ago I was looking around I saw these", "88:50", "little pieces of disparate information", "88:52", "and I came to the conclusion", "88:53", "the genetics revolution was going to", "88:54", "change everything so I educated myself I", "88:57", "started writing articles I was invited", "89:00", "to testify before Congress and then to", "89:03", "try to get that story out I was I", "89:04", "started I wrote my my two most recent", "89:06", "near-term sci-fi novels Genesis Code and", "89:09", "eternal sonata and when I was on book", "89:11", "tours for those and I explained the", "89:13", "science to people the way I kind of a", "89:15", "self educated citizen scientist and a", "89:18", "novelist would explain the science all", "89:20", "of a sudden people got it and that was", "89:22", "when I realized I needed to write the", "89:24", "book about the genetics revolution that", "89:26", "people could absorb that wouldn't scare", "89:28", "people but my mission for the book is", "89:30", "that this stuff as we've talked about", "89:33", "it's so important that everybody needs", "89:36", "to be part of the conversation we have", "89:38", "this brief window and what I'm calling", "89:39", "for is this species wide dialogue on the", "89:42", "future of human genetic in genetic", "89:43", "engineering and I have a whole game plan", "89:45", "in the book about what people can do how", "89:48", "they can get involved people", "89:50", "individually on a national level we have", "89:53", "to put a lot of pressure on our elected", "89:54", "leaders and say stop focusing on the", "89:57", "crap there is really important stuff", "89:59", "that needs to be addressed and we need", "90:01", "leadership I'm going I'm speaking on in", "90:04", "in Congress a week and a half from now", "90:08", "talking about about these issues so we", "90:10", "need to have venom on an international", "90:12", "level we have to have some kind of", "90:14", "international system we're so far away", "90:17", "from being able to do that we don't even", "90:18", "know what the standards are but we have", "90:20", "to be pushing and so it I know you think", "90:22", "of it in terms of like the same way we", "90:24", "have with like nuclear weapons yeah in a", "90:26", "way in many ways yeah but the thing is", "90:28", "with nuclear weapons a lot of that", "90:29", "happened at the state level at the", "90:31", "country level this needs to happen at a", "90:33", "popular level and at a at a government", "90:36", "level so the only way that that's going", "90:38", "to happen effectively is we need a real", "90:40", "comprehensive education on the subject", "90:42", "it's not that people can just guess", "90:44", "right how do you know what's the", "90:46", "consequences what where we're at right", "90:48", "now yeah right", "90:50", "yeah and that's and that's like Sanjay", "90:51", "Gupta had a wonderful quote that's", "90:53", "actually on the cover of my book which", "90:54", "is if you can read one book on the", "90:56", "future of our species this is it so what", "90:57", "I've tried to do is to say like if you", "90:59", "just want to go to one place to", "91:01", "understand what's happening what's at", "91:02", "stake what it means for you and what you", "91:05", "can do now if you want to get", "91:07", "involved I've tried to do that but then", "91:08", "ironically I'm now like as I mentioned", "91:11", "being asked to speak to thousands of", "91:13", "doctors and scientists because they're", "91:14", "all reading this book and they're saying", "91:15", "this is this is positioning my work in", "91:18", "in a much bigger context Sanjay Gupta is", "91:21", "a very interesting cat because he was", "91:23", "very anti marijuana and then he started", "91:25", "doing research on it and then totally", "91:27", "flipped 180 degrees yeah which to me is", "91:29", "a great sign of both humility and", "91:31", "intelligence I recognize that the data", "91:33", "was different in his presupposition yes", "91:35", "yeah he had these prejudices that were", "91:38", "very common yeah yeah now when you speak", "91:42", "to Congress yeah what do you do they", "91:45", "briefed you in terms of like what they", "91:46", "would like specifically for you to", "91:48", "address No so this one it's I've been", "91:51", "asked to go and speak and a lot of", "91:53", "members of Congress who are going to be", "91:54", "invited and what I'm going to tell them", "91:57", "is look this is really important our", "92:00", "Congress is not doing enough and here", "92:02", "are the things that we need to do and", "92:04", "what are you gonna say to try to really", "92:06", "get it into their head what I'm gonna", "92:08", "say is that the genetics revolution is", "92:09", "here if we don't have a system if you", "92:13", "don't have a rational system to manage", "92:16", "it if we don't have a system you talked", "92:17", "about public education the challenge", "92:20", "that we face in the United States is we", "92:21", "traditionally have had a representative", "92:22", "democracy and now we're transitioning", "92:25", "from a representative democracy to a", "92:27", "popular democracy so Switzerland has a", "92:30", "popular democracy but they have like", "92:31", "really well-educated people who are able", "92:33", "who have enough information to make", "92:35", "smart decisions", "92:36", "we haven't educated our public and yet", "92:39", "the public is making big decisions and a", "92:41", "lot of it is happening just on a gut", "92:42", "feeling that's what's happening with", "92:44", "trade agreements where people is have I", "92:46", "have a feeling it's bad without you know", "92:48", "the ability to really get into the into", "92:51", "the details and so we are having that", "92:53", "transition which means there's a lot of", "92:55", "responsibility on us to educate our", "92:57", "public and it's just it's a tragedy we", "92:58", "treat people in this country like you", "93:00", "can just throw people away like you so", "93:02", "many if you're in some crappy school", "93:04", "system and you know your your your", "93:07", "chances of success are so minimized not", "93:10", "because if anything that you've done", "93:12", "just because of your circumstance then", "93:14", "it's unacceptable", "93:14", "it is only so I mean the equal", "93:16", "opportunity is what we really should all", "93:18", "strive for us and", "93:19", "I think some people conflate that with", "93:21", "op equal success right and you're not", "93:25", "going to get the same equality of", "93:28", "outcome you're gonna get different", "93:29", "different amounts of effort and", "93:31", "different people are qualified or more", "93:33", "talented at different things but what", "93:36", "I'm worried about is what I said", "93:37", "initially that some people are gonna get", "93:40", "a hold of this stuff quickly and it's", "93:42", "gonna give them an a massive advantage", "93:44", "yes so sort of like I mean if you the", "93:48", "first person that has the ability to go", "93:50", "forward in time five minutes right is", "93:53", "going to be able to manipulate the stock", "93:54", "market and yeah unprecedented way I", "93:57", "don't think that that's really possible", "93:58", "in our lifetime but that's the kind of", "94:00", "thing I'm talking about you'd get so far", "94:02", "ahead right that if we're talking about", "94:04", "competition there will be no catching up", "94:06", "baby you don't have to travel in time to", "94:09", "do that right yeah but there's real", "94:14", "technologies that are likely to happen", "94:15", "which are going to confer billions tens", "94:19", "hundreds of billions of dollars of", "94:20", "benefit of advance yeah yeah and that", "94:23", "stuff is is happening now and this is", "94:25", "the concern with getting behind", "94:27", "countries like China cuz they're already", "94:31", "yeah moving in this direction in terms", "94:33", "of technology yeah so I am a proud", "94:36", "American my father and grandparents came", "94:38", "here as refugees I believe in what this", "94:40", "country at our best stands for I want us", "94:43", "to continue to be the country that's", "94:45", "setting an example for the rest of the", "94:47", "world that is articulating what our", "94:49", "ideals of responsibility and governance", "94:52", "good governance and accountability and", "94:55", "all these things that we've championed", "94:56", "and because of that I want us to get our", "94:59", "act together politically and I want us", "95:01", "to be the leading technological country", "95:04", "in the world and so I think that's", "95:07", "what's what's at stake and we're losing", "95:09", "so much time because there was a time in", "95:11", "the period after the Second World War", "95:12", "where we recognize that technological", "95:15", "leadership was the foundation for", "95:17", "everything else we were we had recreated", "95:19", "the world out of the ashes of the of the", "95:21", "war but we realized that we needed to", "95:23", "have economic growth we needed to have", "95:25", "the competition we needed to have these", "95:26", "technologies and and we it was a miracle", "95:29", "what we've what we've done and now we", "95:31", "we've lost our focus and we", "95:33", "have to regain it the way I look at", "95:35", "humans and the way I look at the human", "95:37", "race today in 2019 it's like we're", "95:39", "driving very fast through fog yeah it's", "95:41", "very difficult to see what's in front of", "95:43", "us yeah when I look back at you know if", "95:46", "you've written HG Wells but some of his", "95:48", "predictions about the future are really", "95:50", "interesting because he he was pretty", "95:53", "close on quite a few findings but that", "95:55", "that vision to be able to sit there and", "95:58", "use your imagination close your eyes and", "96:00", "think what is this going to be like what", "96:03", "is what what we're dealing with now and", "96:05", "that hos - as opposed to what 21 19", "96:08", "right what is which is similar to HG", "96:10", "Wells yeah versus us right what the fuck", "96:12", "is that gonna be like like yeah is there", "96:16", "going to be a time where there are no", "96:18", "diseases there there is no death and", "96:21", "that we just have to regulate population", "96:24", "control in some sort of other manner and", "96:26", "the only way people die they're going to", "96:27", "die from accidents and things along", "96:29", "those lines but but mortality in terms", "96:32", "of old age I mean this is that's a", "96:34", "according to David Sinclair this is a", "96:36", "fixable issue yeah you know when they", "96:39", "fix it they fix it in 20 years or 30", "96:41", "years or 50 years maybe David is a", "96:44", "friend and I have a whole chapter I", "96:46", "don't want to misquote yeah yeah I have", "96:48", "a whole chapter in the book on the the", "96:50", "science of of human life extension so I", "96:52", "think definitely it's real that we're", "96:54", "going to live healthier longer we're", "96:56", "gonna harness our technology of that I", "96:58", "don't think that immortality that", "97:00", "biological immortality is in is in the", "97:02", "cards maybe not immortality because", "97:04", "we'll still be biologically vulnerable", "97:05", "what I have hearts and brains all right", "97:07", "but aging yeah I think we will age", "97:10", "slower and we will live healthier longer", "97:12", "and I think it's it's going to be great", "97:14", "but back to your core point I mean", "97:16", "that's the reason why I also write", "97:18", "science fiction is that the world of", "97:20", "science is changing so fast that we", "97:22", "really need to apply a lot of", "97:25", "imagination to imagine where it's going", "97:27", "because if you're just looking at what's", "97:29", "happening now it's like this train is", "97:31", "gonna speed by you we have to kind of a", "97:33", "magic Wayne Gretzky we have to imagine", "97:35", "where the puck is going to be not where", "97:37", "it is now and I I mentioned George", "97:39", "church who's like he's at Harvard he's", "97:41", "like the living Charles Darwin and I do", "97:43", "a lot of speaking alongside George and", "97:46", "become our little thing that he says", "97:48", "that he reads science fiction like mine", "97:51", "and then imagined says well that's", "97:53", "pretty cool how can we do that and what", "97:55", "I do is I look at the research coming", "97:57", "out of labs like George's and ice", "97:58", "alright well that's where we are now", "98:00", "what's that going to mean in 20 50 100", "98:03", "years and so we have to that the science", "98:05", "fiction plays a more important role than", "98:08", "it ever has in kind of imagining where", "98:11", "we're going and it's that imagining that", "98:14", "allows us to try to say well what if", "98:16", "that's one of the options of where we're", "98:18", "going what are the decisions that we", "98:20", "need to make now so that we can have a", "98:22", "better outcome rather than a worse if", "98:24", "you're gambling person I don't know if", "98:26", "you are but if I had to give you a", "98:28", "hundred bucks to put on something in 20", "98:32", "years it's going to be profoundly just", "98:36", "it changed it's gonna change us in a way", "98:39", "that is something that we are not really", "98:43", "prepared to understand or deal with what", "98:45", "do you think that's gonna be I think", "98:46", "it's going to be predictive genetics", "98:48", "that we're going to have all right now", "98:50", "it's like you go to your doctor when", "98:52", "you're sick you could have been this", "98:54", "could have been some genetic disorder", "98:56", "that you had from the moment you were", "98:58", "conceived and it was ticking and it was", "99:01", "ticking and you showed up 50 years later", "99:03", "when that's been manifest so it's going", "99:06", "to be very different you're taking your", "99:08", "kid home from the hospital your newborn", "99:10", "and the doctor says hey congratulations", "99:13", "this is really great but just FYI your", "99:17", "kid has a 50% greater than average", "99:19", "chance of getting early onset", "99:20", "Alzheimer's 50 years from now hmm and", "99:23", "your cat your kid has a really great", "99:26", "chance of being phenomenal at abstract", "99:28", "math like how are we going to think", "99:30", "about how are we think about what it", "99:31", "means to be human when we have all of", "99:34", "that information and there are things", "99:35", "now that we call fate and it's it's it's", "99:38", "a just a different model and so I think", "99:40", "that and once we have that that's going", "99:42", "to change a lot a lot of things it's", "99:43", "going to fundamentally transform our", "99:45", "healthcare what we call healthcare now", "99:47", "is really sick care you show up with a", "99:48", "symptom this is going to be predictive", "99:50", "and it's going to change the we the way", "99:52", "we make babies because people are going", "99:54", "to have real choices about which embryos", "99:57", "to implant and we're going to have a lot", "99:59", "of information", "100:00", "a lot of really intimate stuff so you", "100:02", "feel like genetic manipulation and", "100:04", "genetic engineering genetic", "100:06", "understanding genetic knowledge and then", "100:08", "applied genetic medicine yeah those are", "100:11", "gonna be the big changes in the next 20", "100:12", "years even more so than technology it's", "100:14", "it's interconnected because these", "100:16", "there's really it's like a super", "100:18", "convergence of these technologies so the", "100:19", "the genetics revolution is the", "100:22", "artificial intelligence revolution in a", "100:23", "sense that the complexity of genetics is", "100:26", "so great it's way beyond what our brains", "100:29", "on their own could process and so really", "100:32", "the way that all these technologies are", "100:34", "touching each other and so the", "100:36", "biological models are now influencing", "100:39", "the AI so for example we are coming to", "100:42", "the limits of silicon storage but DNA", "100:46", "has unlimited storage capacity so it's", "100:50", "the the as I've said before the kind of", "100:52", "the boundaries between biology and AI or", "100:56", "genetics and AI is going to be very", "100:58", "blurry yeah that is an interesting", "101:00", "concept right the idea of storing", "101:02", "information in DNA and that has been", "101:04", "discussed", "101:05", "yeah which the DNA is the greatest", "101:07", "information storage mechanism ever", "101:10", "imagined so the question is what happens", "101:12", "when you do store things in there and", "101:14", "how does that information interact with", "101:15", "all the rest of stuff that's in your", "101:16", "body already well I mean if you can do", "101:18", "it in your body you could doesn't have", "101:19", "to right it doesn't their body just", "101:21", "think of like your your DNA has four", "101:24", "billion years of history and it's done a", "101:26", "great job of recording it it's English", "101:28", "yeah like I have old 8-track tapes they", "101:31", "haven't lasted that is a squirrely", "101:33", "concept that you have all that data", "101:35", "inside your head I mean that's also when", "101:38", "people make when they try to understand", "101:40", "instincts yeah that people have these", "101:43", "are some sort of genetically encoded", "101:45", "memories all right some understanding of", "101:47", "things that are dangerous and that these", "101:49", "that they're in there because this is", "101:52", "how we've learned over the years without", "101:53", "actually having experiences thanks", "101:55", "personally yeah ya know so that's it's", "101:58", "baked in our genetics are baked into us", "102:01", "and so you know I don't know if you've", "102:03", "been to Indonesia before I was in", "102:05", "Indonesia and then with this place", "102:06", "called Komodo Island oh wow the Dragons", "102:09", "the Komodo dragons and it was", "102:10", "fascinating because it's like you can", "102:12", "tell they don't have plaintiffs", "102:13", "attorneys years", "102:14", "walking around there all these Komodo", "102:15", "dragons and so yeah these are like the", "102:16", "most deadly creatures on earth and", "102:18", "there's like some little guy with a", "102:19", "little stick and it's like how effective", "102:21", "is that stick but the way it works too", "102:23", "so you're just walking around I'm just", "102:24", "walking around because the komodo checks", "102:26", "when they're not killing people or", "102:28", "killing em they're just sitting there", "102:30", "okay", "102:31", "do they ever get jacked people ever go", "102:33", "there and get bitten yes and they say", "102:35", "only a few times a year it's like wow", "102:36", "that seems like a years a lot of it but", "102:39", "the way it works for a komodo dragon a", "102:41", "mother lays the egg and then buries the", "102:45", "egg and then forgets where the egg is", "102:48", "and then let's just say that this egg", "102:50", "hatches and this little Komodo dragon", "102:53", "comes out and the mother sees her own", "102:56", "baby Komodo dragon she'll eat it in a", "102:58", "second and so if you're a komodo dragon", "103:01", "you better have your entire survival", "103:05", "strategy baked into your DNA because", "103:07", "nobody's teaching you anything and so", "103:10", "for us we have this sense that it's like", "103:13", "parenting is really important it is", "103:15", "environment is really important it is", "103:16", "but so much of who and what we are is", "103:18", "baked in to our genetics and I think", "103:21", "that's that's going to be this challenge", "103:23", "we're going to see ourselves as", "103:24", "increasingly genetic beings we can't", "103:26", "become genetic determinists think that", "103:28", "we're just genetics but we're going to", "103:30", "know a lot more we're going to demystify", "103:32", "a lot of what it means to be a human", "103:34", "poof yeah teve is right but are we gonna", "103:37", "lose the the romance and the the just", "103:40", "the randomness of life because that", "103:42", "that's what people are concerned with", "103:43", "right yeah like if if we have some sort", "103:46", "of genetic uniformity I mean especially", "103:49", "in particularly with like things like", "103:51", "intelligence and athletic performance", "103:53", "we're not gonna appreciate freaks as", "103:55", "much yeah maybe we'll all want to be", "103:57", "freaks because they're all gonna want", "103:58", "the freaks are the ones who push us and", "104:00", "so I think I'm not gonna want to be a", "104:01", "moron yeah well your question it's it's", "104:04", "the essential question it's like what", "104:07", "makes a human a human isn't just someone", "104:09", "we have higher IQ that doesn't make you", "104:10", "a better human that makes you someone", "104:11", "with a higher IQ but how are we going to", "104:14", "think about constructing societies when", "104:16", "it's up to us like if we are going to", "104:19", "say we value certain people certain", "104:22", "ideas I think we're going to need", "104:23", "artists like right now people like", "104:26", "artists are sometimes in", "104:27", "mainstream sometime they're on the", "104:29", "fringe but artists are going to be maybe", "104:30", "the most important people in this new", "104:32", "world and right like right now in", "104:33", "hospitals we have kind of a hierarchy", "104:35", "and like the most technical people at", "104:37", "the people who are valued the most and", "104:39", "the least technical people like some of", "104:41", "the nurses or nurses aides are the", "104:43", "people who are often valued and paid the", "104:45", "least but when technology can do these", "104:49", "technological feats what's going to be", "104:52", "left is how can we be great humans how", "104:55", "can we a moat how can we connect how can", "104:57", "we create art and if we get swept away", "104:59", "by this tide of science as and you know", "105:03", "how excited I am about the science", "105:05", "beautifully and we could really", "105:06", "undermine our humanity right as for", "105:09", "humans what humans value is many aspects", "105:12", "of that humanity and are the creations", "105:15", "yeah the literature things we when you", "105:20", "read someone's great prose you're", "105:22", "reading like an insight into their mind", "105:24", "and that's what's interesting about it", "105:25", "right you like yes you're not gonna get", "105:27", "that from just ones and zeroes yeah and", "105:29", "that's and there there will always be", "105:31", "this would we call it mystery and even", "105:34", "if we can do a genetic analysis of", "105:37", "Shakespeare and Mozart and and whatever", "105:39", "like it's still miraculous and we need", "105:42", "to celebrate that and we can't we can't", "105:45", "allow us to say that we are just our", "105:46", "genetics or even just our biology but we", "105:49", "also can't just say biology has nothing", "105:51", "to do with it especially because we're", "105:53", "going to know more about our biology and", "105:55", "about our differences and that's that's", "105:58", "normal I mean it used to be in the old", "105:59", "days that everyone thought well God is", "106:01", "weather and now we understand weather", "106:03", "pretty much and nobody's saying oh that", "106:04", "lightning that's God is delivering a", "106:07", "message it could be but we still like we", "106:10", "still have that mystery and I think that", "106:11", "it's in some ways it's about our", "106:13", "orientation like how do we make sure", "106:15", "that we keep this view of life that we", "106:18", "have artists and humanists who are just", "106:21", "at the core of this conversation about", "106:24", "where we're going what if that mystery", "106:26", "ultimately turns out to just be ignorant", "106:27", "and that as you develop more and more", "106:29", "understanding there's less and less", "106:30", "mystery would we like to be less smart", "106:33", "would we like to be or overwhelmed by", "106:37", "possibility I mean it could be I think", "106:39", "those that be part of what romance", "106:41", "it could be and certainly like the", "106:43", "unknown every we wake up every morning", "106:45", "for and we just don't know the answer", "106:47", "and there are some people like going", "106:49", "back to the issues of life extension", "106:51", "there are some people who say well that", "106:54", "death is essential for appreciating life", "106:57", "I talk about this stuff all around and", "107:00", "then there are people who say you know", "107:01", "you're talking about eliminating these", "107:02", "terrible diseases but I know somebody", "107:05", "who had that terrible disease and their", "107:08", "suffering was a gift to everybody else", "107:10", "because we all had more humanity in", "107:13", "response to their suffering like well", "107:14", "that's kind of screwed up I'd prefer", "107:16", "them to not have that suffering but", "107:17", "those people were thinking why it's", "107:20", "wacky but we need to like I totally", "107:22", "agree with you that if we allow", "107:24", "ourselves to get swept away with this", "107:26", "kind of scientific determinism if we", "107:28", "don't say we really value our humanistic", "107:32", "traditions our artists our culture's we", "107:35", "could get lost and we could become", "107:38", "obsolete we could become obviously but", "107:39", "we could also just become less human and", "107:41", "there's something wonderful and there's", "107:42", "magic but do you think that monkeys used", "107:45", "to think man can't become a human we", "107:47", "become less monkey yeah you know you", "107:49", "know I'm saying but no being looks in", "107:52", "the mirror and recognizes that they are", "107:54", "evolving yeah but we've only been Homo", "107:56", "sapiens for about three hundred thousand", "107:57", "years right um so we just it's hard we", "108:01", "know where we've come from because you", "108:02", "see all those little charts from high", "108:04", "school biology but it's really hard for", "108:06", "people to imagine being something else", "108:08", "in the future it's it's it's outside of", "108:11", "our of our consciousness and so say chi", "108:13", "well square yeah and we are monkeys it's", "108:15", "just that we've redefined our monkey", "108:17", "thing you know we do it with a you're a", "108:19", "little different way that's how I was", "108:21", "kind of getting out are you concerned at", "108:23", "all with artificial life are you", "108:24", "concerned about the propagation of", "108:26", "artificial intelligence well there are", "108:29", "different kinds of artificial life so", "108:31", "one is artificial intelligence and I", "108:33", "know people like Elon Musk and and late", "108:36", "Stephen Hawking are afraid terrified", "108:38", "yeah and I think that that we need", "108:41", "whether it's right or not I think it's", "108:43", "great for us to focus on those risks", "108:44", "because if we just say oh that's that's", "108:46", "crazy", "108:47", "and we don't focus on it it increases", "108:49", "the likelihood of these bad things", "108:52", "happening so kudos to to Elon Musk", "108:54", "but I think that we are we're a long way", "108:57", "away from that threat and we are and we", "109:00", "will be enormous beneficiaries of these", "109:03", "technologies and that's why my don't", "109:06", "sound like a broken record but that's", "109:07", "why I keep saying it's all about values", "109:09", "if I think we should take those threats", "109:10", "very seriously and then some users are", "109:12", "so abstract and we don't agree on them", "109:14", "it's true but like like Elon Musk I mean", "109:16", "they've set up this this Institute where", "109:18", "to say well what are the dangers right", "109:20", "and then what are the things that we can", "109:21", "do now what are standards that we can", "109:23", "integrate for example into our computer", "109:25", "programming and and so I mentioned my", "109:28", "World Health Organization Committee the", "109:29", "question is well what are the what are", "109:31", "the standards that we can integrate into", "109:34", "scientific culture it's not going to", "109:36", "cure everything but it may increase the", "109:37", "likelihood of it better rather than", "109:39", "worse outcome but isn't there an", "109:40", "inherent danger in other companies or", "109:43", "other countries rather not complying", "109:44", "with any standards that we set because", "109:46", "it would be anti-competitive yes like", "109:48", "that would that would they would somehow", "109:50", "another diminish competition or diminish", "109:53", "their competitive edge yes", "109:54", "it's true and that's why that's the", "109:56", "balance that we're going to need to need", "109:58", "to hold it's and it's really hard but we", "110:01", "have a window of opportunity now to try", "110:05", "to get ahead of n like we have chemical", "110:07", "weapons biological weapons nuclear", "110:08", "weapons where we've had international", "110:10", "standards that have roughly held I mean", "110:13", "there was a time when slavery was the", "110:15", "norm and there was a movement to say", "110:17", "this is this is wrong and it was largely", "110:19", "successful so we have history of being", "110:23", "more successful rather than than less", "110:25", "and I think that's the goal but you're", "110:28", "right I mean this is a race between the", "110:30", "technology and the best values I'm real", "110:33", "concerned about artificial intelligence", "110:34", "is that this paradigm shifting moment", "110:37", "will happen before we recognize it's", "110:39", "happened yes and then it'll be too late", "110:40", "yes that's exactly right and that's like", "110:42", "I saying that's that's why I've written", "110:43", "the book that's why I'm out on the road", "110:46", "so much talking to people why I why it's", "110:48", "such an honor for me to be and pleasure", "110:50", "for me to be here with you talking about", "110:51", "it cuz we have to reach out to people", "110:54", "people can't be afraid of entering this", "110:57", "conversation because it feels too", "110:59", "technical it feels like it's somebody", "111:00", "else's business this is all of our", "111:02", "business because this is all of our", "111:04", "lives and it's all of our futures so if", "111:06", "in the future you think 20 years that", "111:08", "that's going to really change the most", "111:09", "is predictive genetics and you'd be able", "111:11", "to be able to write predict accurately a", "111:14", "person's health", "111:15", "what do you help in light health and", "111:17", "yeah what do you think is gonna be the", "111:20", "biggest detriment for all this stuff and", "111:22", "the thing that we have to avoid the most", "111:23", "yeah so one is as I mentioned this", "111:26", "determinism just because if we just kind", "111:29", "of take our sense of wonder about what", "111:32", "it means to be a human away like that's", "111:35", "really going to to harm us we talked", "111:38", "about equity and access to these", "111:40", "technologies and and in the technologies", "111:42", "don't even need to be real in order to", "111:46", "have a negative impact so in India there", "111:50", "are no significant genetic differences", "111:52", "between people in different castes but", "111:53", "the caste system has been maintained for", "111:55", "thousands of years because people just", "111:57", "have accepted these these differences so", "112:00", "this it's a whole new way of", "112:02", "understanding what is a human and it's", "112:05", "really going to be complicated and we", "112:07", "aren't ready for it we weren't ready for", "112:08", "it culturally we aren't ready for it", "112:11", "educational ii certainly our political", "112:12", "leaders aren't paying much of any", "112:15", "attention to all of this we have a huge", "112:16", "job", "112:17", "woof so when you sit down and you give", "112:22", "this speech to congress yeah what what", "112:25", "are you anticipating from them in terms", "112:27", "of like what do you think that there's", "112:29", "anything they can do now yeah absolutely", "112:31", "certain step yes so a few things one is", "112:34", "we need to have a national education", "112:37", "campaign I mean this is so important I", "112:39", "would say it's on the future of genetics", "112:41", "revolution and of AI because I think we", "112:44", "just it's it's crazy that we aren't", "112:48", "focusing on these like I I learned", "112:50", "French in in grade school in high school", "112:53", "and I'm happy to speak French but I", "112:55", "would rather have people say this is", "112:57", "really important stuff so that's that's", "113:00", "number one number two is we need to make", "113:03", "sure that we have a functioning", "113:05", "regulatory system in in this country in", "113:08", "every country and I do a lot of", "113:09", "comparative work and like the United", "113:11", "Kingdom they're really well organized", "113:13", "they have a national health care system", "113:14", "which allows them at a national level to", "113:17", "kind of think about long term care and", "113:20", "again trade offs you", "113:22", "this country the average person changes", "113:25", "health plans every 18 months and I was", "113:27", "talking with somebody the other night", "113:28", "and they were they were working on a", "113:30", "predictive health company and they said", "113:33", "their first idea was they were going to", "113:34", "sell this information to health insurers", "113:37", "because like wouldn't this be great if", "113:39", "you could hell if you're a health", "113:41", "insurer and you could you had somebody", "113:42", "who was your client and you could say", "113:44", "hey here's some information you can live", "113:46", "healthier and you're not going to have", "113:47", "this disease 20 years from now and what", "113:49", "he found out is the health insurers they", "113:51", "could have cared less because people", "113:52", "were just they were only going to be", "113:53", "part of it for a year and a half so we", "113:55", "really need to think differently about", "113:57", "how do we invest in people over the", "114:00", "course of their lives and certainly", "114:02", "education is one but thinking long term", "114:04", "about health and well-being is another", "114:06", "what do you think is gonna be the first", "114:08", "technological innovation like in terms", "114:12", "of like what what's already on the", "114:14", "pipeline right you know that's going to", "114:16", "radically alter human beings so", "114:20", "radically I think it's going to be the", "114:22", "end of procreative sex and so when we", "114:26", "stop conceiving our babies through sex", "114:28", "and we're selecting our embryos that's", "114:31", "going to open up this massive realm of", "114:34", "possibility and certainly when we expand", "114:38", "the number of fertilized eggs that we're", "114:40", "choosing from that that is really I", "114:43", "think that's the kind of the killer", "114:44",

"114:53", "starts once the technology right gets", "114:55", "established it seems like it's going to", "114:58", "be wealthier people that are gonna have", "114:59", "access to it first right well it depends", "115:01", "probably yes but when you think about", "115:04", "right now we have all these people who", "115:07", "are born with these terrible in many", "115:09", "cases deadly genetic diseases and", "115:11", "disorders and what is the societal", "115:13", "expenditure for lifetime care for all", "115:17", "those people I mean this is huge huge", "115:19", "amounts of money so if

of friends who have kids with", "115:51", "Down's with Down syndrome these", "115:53", "wonderful kids and they deserve every", "115:55", "opportunity to thrive the same as as", "115:57", "everybody else and I'm really sensitive", "116:00", "cuz people say well hey if you're and I", "116:01", "say like Down syndrome is largely not", "116:03", "going there aren't going to be newborns", "116:05", "with Down syndrome 10 or 20 years from", "116:07", "now right some people say well what are", "116:08", "you saying about my kids like are you", "116:11", "saying that if this is going to be", "116:12", "eliminated that my kid has a less of a", "116:16", "right to be as somebody else and I", "116:17", "always say absolutely not and we need to", "116:20", "be extremely sensitive that we're not", "116:22", "dehumanizing people but if you have 15", "116:26", "or 15 fertilized eggs in a lab and you", "116:29", "have to pick which one gets implanted in", "116:31", "the mother and one of

real possibility of", "117:01", "them being able to fix that yeah and", "117:04", "some things will be fixable and some", "117:06", "things won't and to that's that's why", "117:08", "though for these for these single gene", "117:10", "mutation disorders there's a debate I", "117:13", "was speaking in Berkeley the other day", "117:15", "and so I was talking about these two", "117:17", "options one is embryo selection and one", "117:19", "is is gene editing and so there were", "117:22", "different people who got up said oh no", "117:23", "we can do embryo selection that's the", "117:25", "way and that we should look we should", "117:27", "prevent these diseases but yeah gene", "117:30", "editing that's going too far that's", "117:32", "that's playing God and so for different", "117:34",

is certainly in the", "117:44", "religious community we're saying well", "117:46", "this is playing God but there's another", "117:49", "kind of it's like a progressive", "117:51", "community who's who are the kinds of", "117:54", "people who are uncomfortable with gently", "117:56", "modified crops people who are saying", "117:58", "that one that the that there's this", "118:01", "slippery

who", "118:17", "are saying we don't understand genetics", "118:19", "well enough to make these changes that", "118:21", "will last forever I'm not in that in", "118:23", "that view I just think that we need to", "118:25", "be cautious and we need to weigh the", "118:26", "been the risks and the benefits of", "118:28", "everything that we do do you think we do", "118:30", "know enough about those changes no it", "118:33", "depends because if we're it depends on", "118:35", "what we're selecting against like if the", "118:37", "thing we're selecting against is some", "118:38", "kind of terrible genetic disease that's", "118:40", "gonna kill somebody when they're a", "118:42", "little kid we have a lot of latitude", "118:44", "because the alternative is is death", "118:47", "right and that's why I was so critical", "118:49", "of this Chinese bio physicist who", "118:52", "created who generally engineered these", "118:53", "two little girls born in China last year", "118:55", "because he wasn't in the gene edits they", "118:58", "weren't probably weren't successful it", "119:00", "wasn't to eliminate some disease or", "119:03", "disorder he was trying to confer the", "119:05", "benefit of increased resistance to HIV", "119:08", "and so I think that we need to be very", "119:10", "mindful and we need to be doing kind of", "119:12", "a cost-benefit analysis of the different", "119:15", "things different interventions and there", "119:17", "was an unintended side effect of this or", "119:20", "they believe a perceived potential", "119:22", "unintended side effect and that's", "119:24", "increased intelligence weights it's a", "119:26", "possibility so so this gene is it's", "119:29", "called a ccr5 is this gene and when it", "119:33", "was disrupted in some mouse studies", "119:37", "those mice became a little bit able to", "119:40", "navigate mazes and so that was what led", "119:43", "people to believe that this disruption", "119:45", "of the ccr5 could potentially lead to", "119:48", "that kind of change in human nobody", "119:50", "really knows there's lots of things that", "119:51", "happen in mice that don't have analogs", "119:54", "in humans

"120:15", "that's the thing you so you're exactly", "120:16", "right like we are humans we're nuts as a", "120:19", "species and so and so we need to try to", "120:21", "establish some kind of guide

there's got to be a", "120:34", "shit ton of that going on right now as", "120:36", "we're talking China what do you think is", "120:38", "happening over there you know I think", "120:39", "China has a lot of money they have", "120:43", "brilliant people and they have a", "120:45", "government that is hell-bent on leading", "120:48", "the world in advanced technology yeah", "120:50", "and the scientific culture in China is", "120:54", "just very different than it is here and", "120:56", "so we know what we know but we don't", "120:59", "know what we don't know and that's it's", "121:01", "a really really big deal because China", "121:04", "is in many ways a Wild West and the", "121:08", "technology exists to do some really big", "121:11", "stuff and that's that's why we have to", "121:15", "at least try to establish standards will", "121:18", "we succeed fully no but maybe we can do", "121:20", "better than then worse are you", "121:21", "anticipating seeing like a lot of freaky", "121:23", "things coming out of China", "121:24", "yes whoa you said that very query yeah", "121:27", "no it's I spend a lot of time in China I", "121:31", "and this it's a different man but

why if", "122:26", "you want to see if you want to see great", "122:29", "Chinese art you have to go to Taiwan", "122:31", "because when the Chinese nationalists", "122:33", "left in 1949 when they

have to focus on and", "125:31", "certainly the rise of China is such an", "125:35", "essential story for the 21st century", "125:37", "because China is competing in all of", "125:40", "these

"125:49", "say we cannot believe these people are", "125:51", "so lazy like why are they not working 24", "125:54", "hours a day why are they not issuing", "125:56", "product new products every every week", "125:59", "and so this is I mean they are racing", "126:02", "somewhere and it's going to have huge", "126:04", "implications for the world and so if we", "126:07", "believe in our values is that I believe", "126:09", "we should we have to fight for them in", "126:11", "the place that we have to fight for them", "126:12", "first is here and we can't you know it's", "126:15", "just like every day that we're just", "126:17", "focusing on this this drama this reality", "126:20", "TV drama of our government is another", "126:22", "day where we're not focusing on the big", "126:24",

"126:32", "have this whole fight of how do we keep", "126:33", "people out what I'd like to do is to go", "126:35", "to the State Department's all right", "126:36", "every embassy in the world you have a", "126:38", "new job you have to we're going to give", "126:40", "you whatever a number 500 slots per year", "126:43", "you have to you", "126:43", "your country find the 500 most brilliant",

could take over we", "127:06", "could revitalize this country but we're", "127:08", "having this fight of how do we keep a", "127:10", "small number of refugees out and it's", "127:13", "just we're not focusing on the right", "127:14", "things that's a that's again another", "127:17", "very very interesting perspective we are", "127:20", "we learned about Huawei in this country", "127:23", "really not just well I learned about it", "127:25", "because they put out some pretty", "127:26", "innovative phones and interesting", "127:28", "technology but we learned it because the", "127:31", "State Department was telling people to", "127:32", "stop using their phones yep do you think", "127:35", "that that is trying to stifle the", "127:37", "competition they'd like to try because",

is", "127:48", "largely out of that conversation right", "127:50", "and if they were in America they would", "127:52", "probably dominate in America as well", "127:54", "because they're cheaper yeah and they're", "127:56", "really good yeah I mean their phones are", "127:59", "insane there the cameras and their", "128:00", "phones are off the charts yeah they they", "128:03", "put some video of the the zoom", "128:05", "capability of their newest phone and", "128:08", "people are calling bullshit there's like", "128:10", "there's no way that's not possible but", "128:11", "it turned out it was true", "128:13", "yeah they really can it really can zoom", "128:15", "like a super expensive telephoto lens", "128:17", "yeah yeah so wall way it's a complicated", "128:22", "story for sure the founder of Huawei", "128:24", "is a former Chinese military officer for", "128:27", "sure sure in the early stages of their", "128:30", "company they stole straight out stole", "128:33", "lots of source code from companies like", "128:36", "Cisco for sure we should be really", "128:39", "worried if Huawei is the sole supplier", "128:43", "of the infrastructure that supports 5g", "128:46", "all around the world because the Chinese", "128:49", "government would have access to", "128:51", "everything and so that leads us to the", "128:53", "question is one is there a problem with", "128:55", "Huawei itself", "128:57", "and but then two is let's just say and I", "129:00", "in citing the answer to that first", "129:01", "question is probably yes but then the", "129:05", "question to is let's just say why away", "129:07", "is a legit company and they're not", "129:09", "totally intimately connected to the", "129:12", "Chinese government", "129:13", "can we trust their relationship with the", "129:16", "Chinese government the Chinese", "129:16", "government has it ruled that every one", "129:18", "of these companies has the big Chinese", "129:20", "national companies national champion", "129:22", "companies they have a communist party", "129:25", "cell inside of that company and so these", "129:28", "like I think that we can't think of big", "129:30", "Chinese companies just like we think of", "129:33", "companies here we have to think of them", "129:35", "as quasi state actors and that's why", "129:37", "this dis fight that's happening right", "129:39", "now is is so important and that's why", "129:41", "like when China is out investing in", "129:44", "different parts of the world including", "129:45", "Africa their companies are kind of", "129:48", "acting like arms of the government I", "129:50", "mean they're making all kinds of", "129:52", "investments that don't really make sense", "129:54", "if you just see well this is a company", "129:56", "doing something if you say that this is", "129:57", "a company with backing by the state", "130:00", "that's fulfilling a function that", "130:01", "supports the state it's it's just it's a", "130:04", "very different model so I I am actually", "130:07", "quite concerned about about hallway and", "130:10", "and I'm not a fan of everything that", "130:12", "this administration is doing but I think", "130:13", "on China it's important that we need to", "130:16", "stand up and I think pushing back on", "130:17", "hallway is the right thing to do I'm", "130:19", "uncomfortable about this for two reasons", "130:21", "one I'm uncomfortable about that about", "130:23", "the Chinese government being inexorably", "130:25", "connected to this global superpower in", "130:27", "technology but I'm also uncomfortable", "130:30", "that it sets a precedent for other", "130:32", "nations to follow yeah because they look", "130:34", "looked as the only way to compete", "130:35", "because what you were talking about the", "130:37", "investments that Huawei or that the", "130:38", "Chinese government makes in these other", "130:40", "yeah these countries and that don't seem", "130:42", "to make sense if you're just dealing", "130:43", "with their company right but if you're", "130:45", "dealing with somebody's trying to take", "130:47", "over the world yeah it makes a lot of", "130:49", "sense yes and so when we have our", "130:51", "companies that you're out in some place", "130:52", "in Africa and you're competing with a", "130:55", "Chinese company on to do something build", "130:57", "a port or whatever yeah and you're", "130:59", "competing because you are an American", "131:02", "company and so you have your caucus ID", "131:04", "this is the port what's the income", "131:05", "stream going to be about and you have a", "131:07", "certain amount that you can bid because", "131:09", "otherwise it becomes a bad investment", "131:11", "but if the Chinese company is that their", "131:13", "calculus is not is this a good or bad", "131:15", "investment it's what is the state", "131:17", "interest in controlling or quasi", "131:20", "controlling this asset and so that's why", "131:22", "we can't project ourselves onto the", "131:26", "Chinese we can't say they're just like", "131:27", "us just different it's if we have", "131:29", "different models and our

it was kind of the same story get", "144:46", "there there'd be like a big field the", "144:48", "farmers had been kicked off there was a", "144:51", "fence around it and then the group of", "144:53",

prices", "145:09", "are how are your workers going to be", "145:11", "empowered so they can change things I", "145:14", "mean in the old days it used to be you", "145:15", "just kind of have these

that's what happens when", "145:24", "you have these totalitarian top-down", "145:27", "systems is that like if you being", "145:30", "creative is actually really dangerous so", "145:32", "if somebody says do X you just do X Wow", "145:36", "yeah now it's a it's really incredible", "145:39", "and it's it's so sad because I spend a", "145:41", "lot of time in South Korea and this is", "145:43", "the most dynamic place there's like I", "145:46", "often I go to Seoul just to see what", "145:48", "technology is going to show up here a", "145:51", "few years in the future minutes it Seoul", "145:53", "is like the future and then just 35", "145:56", "miles from Seoul is the Demilitarized", "145:59", "Zone on the other side it's it's", "146:01", "incredible and the real problem would be", "146:03", "once they finally did get free of that", "146:06", "community or of that that that mean you", "146:10", "can call them whatever you want dictator", "146:12", "and that his family what would they what", "146:17", "tools would they have like how prepared", "146:19", "would they be to be our tongue yes well", "146:21", "it's really the good thing the benefit", "146:23", "that they have if there is so here's my", "146:25", "thought of what a scenario of the", "146:27", "scenario might look like amazing it", "146:29", "eventually probably Philby some kind of", "146:32", "coup attempt against the Kim Fowley", "146:34", "let's just say it succeeds but that", "146:36", "would probably result in another", "146:37", "military dictatorship with another group", "146:39", "well we don't know because then I think", "146:41", "immediately I think the Chinese would", "146:43", "invade really yeah because people think", "146:45", "of the", "146:46", "when people think of the Korean War from", "146:47", "the early 1950s they think oh it's the", "146:49", "Korean War it must have been the", "146:50", "Americans fighting against the the", "146:53", "Koreans but the Korean War the two sides", "146:55", "was America and the South Koreans", "146:56", "fighting against the North Koreans and", "146:59", "the Chinese the Chinese did the most of", "147:02", "the of the of the fighting and so China", "147:05", "North Korea is the only country in the", "147:07", "world that has a treaty alliance with", "147:09", "China kind of like we have with Japan", "147:11", "and within with South Korea and so China", "147:14", "their biggest fear is having a reunified", "147:16", "Korean Peninsula", "147:18", "allied to the United States so I think", "147:20", "if there was a coup the Chinese would", "147:22", "immediately move in militarily then", "147:24", "immediately there would be this call to", "147:27", "have some kind of UN body and there", "147:31", "would be a call for a UN Authority and", "147:34", "then I think it would be agreed that the", "147:36", "Chinese would stay and they just would", "147:37", "put on blue helmets like as a UN force", "147:40", "and then we'd have to negotiate what", "147:43", "happens next and I think what the", "147:44", "Chinese would do would be say well we'll", "147:45", "leave when the Americans leave is that I", "147:47", "think
