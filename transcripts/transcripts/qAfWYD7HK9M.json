so I give say like 50% of people", "69:30", "that got a tag it's usually not that", "69:32", "high but if 50% of people that got a tag", "69:34", "for rifle were successful it might be", "69:37", "10% with a bow might even even less", "69:39", "might be even less than some places all", "69:41", "right depending on how rugged the", "69:42", "landscape is how hard it is to get to", "69:44", "where

some", "99:27", "bubble with each other it's been 25", "99:28", "years since biosphere since eight", "99:30", "scientists sealed themselves in the", "99:32", "biosphere", "99:32", "for two whole years what ended up", "99:34", "happening them I forget they probably", "99:35", "went on a fuck rampage took more than", "99:37", "three months just to make pizza why does", "99:40", "that mean they pray

Christ ship on TV", "104:34", "when do you think is gonna happen that", "104:36", "v's are all electrical like with the", "104:38", "solar oh not for a while man solar", "104:41", "densities tough because a lot of panels", "104:44", "but outhouse", "104:45", "yeah the true well he out here I think a", "104:47", "lot of people are rocking it that way in", "104:49", "two steps they got the solar from the", "104:51", "roof or from the panel's and then it", "104:53", "goes into the battery and the battery in", "104:55", "your charge so a lot of people what they", "104:57", "do is they just it's cheaper just get a", "104:58", "whole bunch of panels mm-hmm and they", "105:01", "reduce their electricity bill by not", "105:02", "having either battery pack itself", "105:04", "restore the electricity right and a lot", "105:07", "of the times people don't have a large", "105:08", "enough battery pack in their homes to", "105:10", "store that energy to charge their cars", "105:11", "you know only a lot of people just have", "105:13", "the panels to offset the price of", "105:15", "electricity that feeds back into the", "105:16", "grid but what I mean is the car itself", "105:18", "like Fisker had that for a while where", "105:19", "their roof", "105:21", "yeah that was powering the radio yeah", "105:24", "it's not good it's like a gimmicky kind", "105:26", "of thing is it gimmick game", "105:27", "it kind of is because you're only", "105:29", "because you're very limited in size", "105:31", "amount of panels that you could put on", "105:33", "the roof it's really only enough to like", "105:35", "trickle charge like a couple of things", "105:36", "here and I mean you think a bigger array", "105:38", "or like heavy solar density and that's", "105:41", "coming but like there's not enough to", "105:42", "really like power the car from it mmm", "105:44", "you don't I mean while you're driving", "105:45", "maybe there's an alternative way to", "105:48", "gather the Sun together raise yeah", "105:51", "because if that would be the most", "105:53", "amazing thing ever if we all had cars", "105:55", "that were left with it just ran on a Sun", "105:57", "and there was no need for oil so I've", "105:59", "done yeah and that's it is that the", "106:00", "Fisker Jamie yeah so that solar array on", "106:04", "the rooftop I think it powers the radio", "106:05", "yeah so like you have that much you only", "106:08", "have so much room on the roof and all", "106:09", "the powers of the radio we're actually", "106:11", "the motor yeah remote it's just it", "106:13", "wouldn't even do it right that didn't", "106:14", "even exist 20 years ago so who knows in", "106:17", "the future that would it seems like it", "106:20", "could be possible you could figure out a", "106:22", "way I can still make it efficient and", "106:23", "now especially out here yeah there's a", "106:25", "ton of Sun out here yeah that would be", "106:28", "by something like a roof I don't", "106:29", "understand you're trying to be hot bro", "106:30", "try to get some dick yeah look at her", "106:32", "try sell cars yeah what's up with the", "106:34", "glasses she's looks really pale - she's", "106:37", "got a burst in the frames that chair", "106:38", "like Cheryl that shares fetus yeah yeah", "106:44", "I mean I think that would be that would", "106:47", "really be the future I think we had no", "106:49", "reliance whatsoever on oil I think that", "106:52", "asked man what do you think about", "106:53", "sticking of Reliance what do you think", "106:55", "about people no longer relying on", "106:57", "driving their own cars what do you think", "106:58", "of everyone owned a Tesla right and well", "107:00", "that would look like everyone put an", "107:02", "autopilot when they went somewhere oh", "107:04", "that looked like you've used autopilot", "107:05", "being on the wheel because you're", "107:07", "nervous I think one day it's gonna be", "107:08",

movie that was", "132:34", "based loosely very very loosely on the", "132:37", "legend of the sky named John Lilly and", "132:39", "John Lilly is the guy who created this", "132:40", "sensory deprivation tank do you know yes", "132:42", "no I do not well he also was a pioneer", "132:45", "and interspecies communication with", "132:46", "dolphins yeah he was a scientist all", "132:48",

she", "133:05", "essentially half of her apartment was", "133:07", "underwater like she was her house was", "133:09", "half submerged so the dolphin would come", "133:12", "in and out of the house and sleep with", "133:13", "her and then go into a tank it's like", "133:15", "her husband or something that was the", "133:16", "problem she was jerking the dolphin off", "133:18", "oh the dolphin like would be distracted", "133:21", "all the time but the dolphin stayed well", "133:22", "of course got jerked off all the time so", "133:24", "they were like Louisville we're paying", "133:26", "for what they were trying to teach the", "133:28", "dolphin to talk right right so they're", "133:29", "trying to teach the dolphin English", "133:31", "words but the problem was dolphins don't", "133:33", "have lips they don't they can't make", "133:35", "there's cords can't make fix times what", "133:37", "we do so they were trying to get a lot", "133:41", "of work for this a lot of work for hello", "133:43", "but it was really obvious that they have", "133:45", "some sort of language right and so Lily", "133:47", "who is obsessed with it he would set up", "133:49", "his sensory deprivation tank right", "133:50", "outside the dolphin tank and take acid", "133:52", "and give acid to the dolphins and he was", "133:54", "trying to communicate with them he was", "133:56", "trying

know", "134:14", "I've never experienced ketamine yeah but", "134:15", "apparently there's something about that", "134:17", "particular drug that lends itself very", "134:19", "well to the sensory deprivation", "134:20", "experience least for Lily", "134:23", "then he's very addictive did you bought", "134:24", "the tank what about that and then I read", "134:27", "a book called the deep self and that was", "134:30", "a book that Lily wrote about you know I", "134:32", "think that one he even had instruction", "134:36", "on how to build a tank", "134:37", "he actually had like set up like
