"can't be trusted your book alien worlds", "00:23", "yeah and a fate of the earth yeah all", "00:26", "about it that's deep shit man just the", "00:29", "just a title alone you like whoa I love", "00:32", "aliens", "00:32", "everybody loves aliens everybody does", "00:34", "but what are you thoughts on actual", "00:36", "aliens and whether or not they've ever", "00:38", "visited here yeah it's interesting", "00:39", "because you know sort of two things so", "00:42", "first of all we should tell everybody", "00:44", "you have a background in science I do", "00:46", "I'm an astrophysicist at the University", "00:48", "of Rochester I run a research group that", "00:50", "studies like stars and planets I'm not a", "00:52", "crazy person I've brought on here no no", "00:54", "no I'm a card-carrying scientist I got a", "00:56", "card and everything so yeah I've been", "00:59", "doing research on you know astronomy", "01:01", "astrophysics for a long time but I also", "01:03", "do all this popular writing like for NPR", "01:04", "in New York Times and that Genesis to", "01:07", "this book came a because I love science", "01:08", "fiction been reading science fiction", "01:09", "since that's kid but also I do a lot of", "01:11", "work on climate change and so I deal", "01:13", "with a lot of climate change denial and", "01:15", "what I realized was that like there's", "01:17", "this way we talk about it that is like", "01:18", "completely forgets about the fact that", "01:20", "like we're probably not the first you", "01:22", "know and that led me to a whole bunch of", "01:25", "research that eventually led to this", "01:26", "book you know including one paper that", "01:28", "we did that showed that the odds that", "01:31", "we're the only time it's ever happened", "01:32", "only you know the only civilization in", "01:34", "the entire history of the universe the", "01:36", "only way that that could be true is if", "01:39", "the odds per planet are one in ten", "01:42", "billion trillion right that's pretty low", "01:45", "right so if you know you know the odds", "01:47", "of anything being one in ten billion", "01:49", "trillion that's pretty freakin low so um", "01:51", "it's probably happened before you know", "01:53", "there's been other civilizations before", "01:54", "ours and once you realize that man that", "01:57", "is like you know changes everything", "01:58", "about how we think about ourselves you", "02:00", "know and what's happening to us right", "02:01", "now so of other civilizations before", "02:05", "ours that have fucked things up well", "02:07", "that's the kind of the premise right so", "02:09", "that's what you know when you look at", "02:10", "climate change right basically what we", "02:12", "it is is civilizations are giant", "02:14", "machines for turning energy into work", "02:16", "right you know New York City right you", "02:18", "sit over and you look at Manhattan", "02:20", "you're", "02:20", "holy shit right now there's all this", "02:21", "energy flowing into it and then there's", "02:23", "all this work being done you know to", "02:25", "keep everything moving and you know", "02:27", "there's no way not to have an impact if", "02:29", "you build a world girdling civilization", "02:31", "which you know that's what a", "02:32", "civilization is there's gonna be impact", "02:34", "so the whole point of my doing this book", "02:35", "was to start looking at ourselves as", "02:39", "just one of you know we're not alone not", "02:42", "the only time this has ever happened", "02:43", "doesn't mean anybody's around now like", "02:45", "that's a different question", "02:46", "but the idea that like it's never", "02:47", "happened before it meaning like you know", "02:49", "you know civilization was happening", "02:51", "around us like this machinery and", "02:52", "everything that you know that just in", "02:54", "the new world of what we understand", "02:55", "about planets and shit that is just like", "02:57", "yeah it's not tenable anymore we got to", "02:59", "wake up the idea that some civilization", "03:04", "has to be the first one that's that's", "03:06", "what the only the only way you could", "03:08", "ever think that we are the only ones is", "03:10", "that some civilization has to be the", "03:12", "first one even in the universe that's", "03:14", "infinite yeah it has to happen one time", "03:17", "right but the idea is are the conditions", "03:20", "ideal in you know a trillion different", "03:23", "spots all over the the infinite spans of", "03:26", "right the universe yeah and that's the", "03:28", "thing right so what we've learned is so", "03:29", "you know one of my trips right now is", "03:31", "like this is not your grandfather's SETI", "03:32", "anymore our understanding we went to", "03:35", "this major revolution in our", "03:36", "understanding of planets about 20 years", "03:38", "ago so you look back at the Greeks right", "03:40", "you can see them arguing about Wendy", "03:41", "whether any other stars had planets", "03:43", "other than you know the Sun and you know", "03:46", "it goes back and forth you know some of", "03:47", "the Greeks were like yeah it's", "03:48", "definitely happening and then like", "03:49", "Aristotle was like no we're the only", "03:51", "world and the soul in the whole universe", "03:52", "you know that has life and then as time", "03:55", "goes on it kind of goes back and forth", "03:57", "and even at the turn of the last of this", "03:58", "the 19th century people thought planets", "04:01", "were incredibly rare that like they all", "04:02", "they thought the only way you could get", "04:03", "a plan it was if two stars passed really", "04:04", "close to each other and they kind of", "04:06", "like taffy pulled out stuff that would", "04:07", "eventually form a planet and the odds of", "04:09", "those kinds of collisions are so small", "04:10", "that people are like you know what", "04:12", "there's just no planets no planets no", "04:14", "life you don't let something really", "04:15", "freaky is going on but then 20 years ago", "04:18", "we discovered our first planet it's not", "04:19", "crazy when you really think about that", "04:21", "20 years is such a short amount of time", "04:23", "1998 yeah yeah and nobody knew before", "04:27", "that like nobody knew whether there were", "04:29", "any planets right you know when I was", "04:30", "starting to strive you were like read", "04:32", "know whether there's gonna be any other", "04:33", "planets and we went from so the first", "04:35", "one was actually 96 I think 95 96 from", "04:38", "that to now where we know that every", "04:41", "freaking star in the sky that's a planet", "04:44", "at least one you know pretty much", "04:45", "everyone pretty on me the big the giant", "04:47", "ones maybe not but they're they're so", "04:49", "rare that you know pretty much every", "04:50", "star you see in this guy has a family of", "04:52", "planets around it that is so nuts it's", "04:55", "so nuts that this is such a new", "04:56", "discovery yeah I mean when we think", "04:58", "about what we know about the universe we", "05:00", "think that we've had a pretty good", "05:02", "understanding of it for a long time", "05:03", "right but the fact that we didn't even", "05:05", "know for sure that there are planets", "05:07", "right right in my own lifetime you know", "05:09", "people were teaching me when I was", "05:10", "starting like you know we just don't", "05:11", "know maybe they're rare and now we know", "05:13", "for certain that they're everywhere and", "05:15", "the other thing people have to realize", "05:16", "is every one of those planets is a place", "05:17", "you know I mean it's a place you could", "05:19", "walk around some of them for sure gonna", "05:21", "have oceans there's gonna be mountains", "05:23", "it's gonna be rain falling you know I", "05:24", "mean like they're all frickin places and", "05:27", "they're all places where things can", "05:29", "happen you know planets are basically", "05:31", "like nature's way of taking sunlight and", "05:33", "doing something interesting with it so", "05:35", "you have ten billion trillion planets in", "05:39", "the universe right and every one of them", "05:41", "is an experiment that's being run so you", "05:43", "know the idea that like we were the", "05:44", "first time it's ever now that we know", "05:45", "that right now that we've gone through", "05:46", "that revolution and understand that", "05:48", "planets are like dime a dozen planets", "05:50", "now not only talk about planets here", "05:52", "well my plants are in the right place", "05:53", "for life to form so there's the idea the", "05:55", "habitable zone right so you know mercury", "05:57", "sucks you cannot you know mercury so hot", "05:59", "that there's no way anything's gonna", "06:00", "happen and you know planets that are far", "06:02", "far enough out they're gonna be so cold", "06:04", "you know they're so far away from their", "06:05", "star that they're gonna be so cold that", "06:07", "they'll you know it's hard to get liquid", "06:08", "water on the surface so we define the", "06:10", "habitable or Goldilocks zone is the", "06:12", "place where you can have you can pour a", "06:14", "little water onto the surface until to", "06:16", "sit there won't freeze and it won't sort", "06:17", "of just evaporate away so all these 10", "06:21", "billion trillion planets sometime out", "06:22", "are all in the right place for life to", "06:24", "form you know and so like with that many", "06:26", "numbers that many experiments being run", "06:28", "like you got to be a psychotic pessimist", "06:30", "to say that like this is the only time a", "06:32", "civilizations ever happened right but", "06:35", "there's still no evidence yet obviously", "06:37", "we didn't even know there really", "06:39", "absolutely were planets until 20 years", "06:41", "ago right but we don't know for sure", "06:43", "that there's something else out there", "06:45", "know", "06:45", "no this is an argument by I call it like", "06:47", "an argument by exhaustion you know if I", "06:49", "gave you a bag of ten billion trillion", "06:51", "planets and you have to sort through all", "06:53", "of them right the odds that you're gonna", "06:55", "you're never gonna find another one that", "06:56", "that built a civilization is pretty", "06:58", "Spinola cup said you're really asking", "06:59", "for really serious pessimism but you", "07:01", "know we're just getting started with", "07:02", "this game right of looking for life", "07:05", "that's why I keep saying it's not this", "07:07", "is not your grandfather's SETI where you", "07:08", "like your point you know a radio", "07:10", "telescope at a star and you kind of wait", "07:11", "to see if whether somebody's Cygnet from", "07:13", "you they are signaling who knows what", "07:15", "they'd be using now what we can do", "07:17", "because we got all these planets to", "07:18", "stare at is you know we're gonna be able", "07:20", "to like stare at them as they pass in", "07:22", "front of their star and get the light", "07:24", "that passes through their atmosphere so", "07:25", "we're gonna like who knows what we're", "07:26", "gonna find you know we're not waiting", "07:28", "for them to signal us anymore", "07:29", "over the next I swear to god man in the", "07:31", "next 30 years we're gonna have data", "07:33", "relevant to the question of life maybe", "07:36", "not civilization so that could happen", "07:37", "too but just life on other worlds you", "07:40", "know and we've never had that for all", "07:41", "the arguments for the entire history of", "07:42", "humanity there's been two dudes yelling", "07:43", "at each other right but in the next", "07:45", "thirty years because the stuff we're", "07:46", "building and now that we had knows", "07:48", "there's uh planets we're gonna have real", "07:50", "data to argue over with so man it's like", "07:52", "this is we're in a whole nother ballgame", "07:54", "now I think the big fear for a lot of", "07:56", "people is what happens when we find out", "07:58", "for sure there's something else out", "07:59", "there yeah if we really do find like", "08:02", "some other Manhattan on some Goldilocks", "08:05", "planet yeah it's hovering some similarly", "08:07", "sized star a billion light years away or", "08:10", "whatever the hell it is that's that's", "08:12", "gonna be very very very strange it will", "08:15", "be it'll be a game-changer right because", "08:17", "for religions for you know I mean wow", "08:19", "you know what do you do if you find", "08:21", "other intelligent creatures who are", "08:22", "building symbolism you start making them", "08:24", "pay taxes that's what you do they're not", "08:28", "doing what you want them to do believe", "08:30", "in this one you know so but I think you", "08:33", "know for me this thing is like it's", "08:34", "about climate change because what it", "08:35", "means it's like there's no way well from", "08:38", "my perspective you know that that if you", "08:40", "have a civilization you push your planet", "08:42", "you know you can't stop it in some sense", "08:44", "if you build a civilizations well the", "08:46", "only way around it is if you have like", "08:49", "subsistence culture the indigenous you", "08:52", "have American culture right which it", "08:56", "seems impossible but it existed here 200", "08:59", "years", "08:59", "we just a blink of an on right right I", "09:01", "know it's amazing it's only 200 years", "09:03", "since like this the ramp-up you know", "09:05", "that the world population only crossed", "09:07", "up the billion mark in like 1850 well", "09:10", "you know I mean it's not there were so", "09:11", "few of us on the planet for most of the", "09:13", "time that even we've been around forget", "09:15", "the planet yeah so you know I think like", "09:17", "there is you know the discovery if we", "09:19", "were to get any evidence you know and I", "09:21", "think the way it's gonna happen he's", "09:23", "gonna be more by accident then by like", "09:25", "signaling you know like this oh so but", "09:27", "if we had any evidence of another", "09:28", "technological just life right if we just", "09:31", "find a biosphere hmmm evidence that you", "09:33", "know and we can do that from a distance", "09:35", "right even if the star is you know 30", "09:37", "light years away if we get if we see as", "09:41", "the light passes through the stars", "09:42", "atmosphere for those few moments if we", "09:44", "see oxygen in the atmosphere you know", "09:46", "we'll be able to detect that that's what", "09:47", "we can do with telescopes we can tell", "09:48", "like whether you can see the", "09:49", "fingerprints of the different kinds of", "09:50", "elements if we see oxygen that", "09:52", "atmosphere you know and methane that", "09:55", "pretty much says that there's a", "09:56", "biosphere there that there's life", "09:57", "because you wouldn't get oxygen would", "09:59", "just like react away really fast if it", "10:00", "wasn't for life like in our on on earth", "10:02", "if it wasn't for life there'd be no", "10:04", "oxygen what are the possibilities of", "10:06", "life that exists in a completely", "10:08", "different environment than we expect", "10:10", "like I know that they found life at the", "10:12", "bottom of the ocean and these volcanic", "10:14", "vents yeah at extreme heats boiling", "10:16", "water they didn't expect to see this", "10:18", "yeah this is fairly recent as well that", "10:20", "is that yeah the idea that the because", "10:22", "right this whole definition of the", "10:23", "habitable zone was based on the idea", "10:25", "like oh you gotta have a surface and", "10:27", "it's got to be you know but now with the", "10:28", "you know not every but like a bunch of", "10:31", "the moons orbiting Jupiter and Saturn", "10:33", "than the gas giants they have oceans", "10:35", "well there's thoughts that your OPA", "10:37", "might have something below the surface", "10:38", "right yeah yeah because the Europa is", "10:40", "you know it's it's this pretty big moon", "10:42", "and we know it's covered in ice where", "10:44", "you can see it's covered in it you know", "10:46", "and we think that layer of ice is maybe", "10:47", "like I don't know 10 kilometers thick", "10:48", "and then below that there maybe 100", "10:50", "kilometers of ocean and because as it", "10:52", "moves around Jupiter its conch the", "10:53", "gravity of Jupiter's always squish in", "10:55", "the inside so there's probably volcanic", "10:56", "activity happening at the surface so you", "10:58", "have hydrothermal vents you know heat", "11:00", "escaping out of and chemicals escaping", "11:02", "out of the at the surface under the", "11:03", "ocean and that's how we think life", "11:05", "formed on on earth that's one of the", "11:07", "arguments for how life formed a firm", "11:08", "formed first in the hydrothermal vents", "11:09", "so yeah you know we it's a nude that's", "11:12", "another game-changer right", "11:13", "so that we should also be thinking not", "11:14", "just about the the classic the habitable", "11:17", "zone but now we got to think about like", "11:19", "life and can you get civilizations in an", "11:20", "underwater civilization you know in an", "11:22", "underwater you maybe have a really rich", "11:23", "ecosystem but you know with the problem", "11:25", "with a you know an underwater life or", "11:29", "forming civilization is that you can't", "11:30", "really do fire right fire was pretty", "11:32", "important for us for metallurgy you know", "11:34", "to build advanced technology you kind of", "11:37", "need combustion so you know that's kind", "11:39", "of the open question with that yeah we", "11:41", "are not really concerned with animals", "11:42", "we're concerned with things that think", "11:44", "and change their environment isn't that", "11:46", "weird like we are concerned with life", "11:48", "but we're only concerned with life", "11:49", "that's at least similar or comparable to", "11:52", "us yeah microbes don't like we don't", "11:54", "know we don't they don't they're not", "11:55", "excited go to Jupiter for some microbes", "11:57", "but we are excited about the things that", "12:00", "they've recently found on Mars right I", "12:01", "mean yeah discovery right yeah right so", "12:04", "you know the thing is actually from the", "12:05", "you know so I'm gonna work in a lot of", "12:08", "fields but I would also consider myself", "12:09", "an astrobiologist right which is a", "12:11", "pretty kind of wild idea that you can do", "12:13", "astrobiology even though you only have", "12:14", "one example which is the earth but we've", "12:16", "learned so much than now we can start", "12:17", "asking ourselves about the possibility", "12:19", "of life elsewhere so finding even a", "12:21", "microbe like even bringing you know", "12:23", "amoeba on Mars would be convinced that", "12:26", "there used to be amoebas on what is the", "12:28", "evidence that they discovered on Mars", "12:29", "what they found was um organic chemistry", "12:32", "right and so our but organic chemistry", "12:34", "and I hated chemistry when I was growing", "12:35", "up and I hated arguing was that just", "12:38", "basically chemistry involving carbon you", "12:41", "know so you can have non or does organic", "12:43", "chemistry doesn't mean organisms but", "12:45", "it's the kind of chemistry that", "12:46", "organisms live right so finding evidence", "12:50", "that there was like they drilled it we", "12:52", "sent a freaking robot to Mars that could", "12:54", "drill through a rock you know and then", "12:56", "ingest the rock and then send the data", "12:58", "back across space you know pretty good", "13:01", "for a bunch of hairless apes yeah so", "13:04", "what what they found was evidence for a", "13:06", "fairly complex you know organic", "13:10", "chemistry which meant that way back when", "13:12", "Mars and this we know for sure right", "13:14", "Mars had water on it we know that for", "13:16", "sure now Mars was a blue planet first", "13:18", "they think that Mars was hit by an", "13:20", "asteroid or a comet or something", "13:22", "well everything got hit by comets that's", "13:24", "how we have you know we have chunks of", "13:25", "Mars here right that you know the thing", "13:26", "in ninety", "13:27", "whatever when they were like we found", "13:28", "life on Mars you know they thought what", "13:30", "they found was fossil bacteria in a", "13:33", "chunk of her Mars that they found in", "13:34", "Antarctica so the planets had been", "13:35", "swapping spit for like the entire", "13:37", "history of the solar sets fossilized", "13:39", "bacteria that they found has that been", "13:41", "confirmed no no most people now think", "13:43", "that the Helen Hills meteorite that", "13:45", "probably you know it's inconclusive and", "13:47", "it's not conclusive enough to be like", "13:49", "yeah we found life it's like a tiny", "13:50", "little squiggly worm looking that's what", "13:52", "it was yeah but it was so small that it", "13:53", "was like way smaller than any of the", "13:55", "microscopic fossilized bacteria we've", "13:56", "ever seen before so people in general", "13:58", "are like me but by five but that's what", "14:01", "started right that's when Clinton was", "14:03", "like okay we're gonna send a lot of shit", "14:04", "tomorrow back in ninety your early 90s", "14:07", "people are kind of done with Mars and so", "14:09", "that's what triggered the whole you know", "14:10", "one space probe after another the Rovers", "14:13", "and like so you know the thing we found", "14:15", "was a direct result of that effort which", "14:17", "was this organic chemistry which says", "14:18", "that back in the day Mars had had a lot", "14:22", "of this stuff lying around had a lot of", "14:23", "these you know these these organic", "14:25", "chemicals lying around which if your", "14:26", "life that's what you're gonna be using", "14:28", "so it's like one more step like we've", "14:30", "been put in the Lego blocks

some other", "14:43", "planet even just a planet with some sort", "14:46", "of plant like life yeah that would be", "14:48", "that'd be a game to a game change", "14:50", "because right now we don't know if", "14:51", "there's we you know are we the only time", "14:53", "in the entire history of the universe", "14:55", "that like this crazy thing where you got", "14:57", "we went from non-life to life like is", "15:00", "that common or is that never ever ever", "15:03", "happen so that's the question we want to", "15:04", "you know we want to answer you know I", "15:06", "mean like a you know that argument I was", "15:07", "given before is I think from the", "15:08", "probable arguments I'm saying it's like", "15:10", "you know it's it's almost overwhelming", "15:11", "that yeah it probably happened somewhere", "15:13", "again doesn't mean anything's here but", "15:15", "we need evidence right science so we got", "15:17", "to build that evidence yeah and if we do", "15:19", "find something the one of the weirder", "15:22", "things would be if we found something", "15:24", "and there was a way to get there yeah", "15:26", "you know we we find something and like", "15:29", "yeah we found something but it's we're", "15:30", "pretty sure there's some kind of life", "15:32", "and it's three billion light years away", "15:34", "like well that's cool yeah what do we do", "15:36", "yeah it's nice to know that we're not", "15:38", "the only ones yeah", "15:40", "you know it's interesting like how much", "15:40", "would that that change you know even if", "15:42", "we found like evidence for this because", "15:44", "is a debate like if we found evidence of", "15:46", "a technological civilization we saw like", "15:47", "alien mega structures like that star", "15:49", "they thought yeah what was that nonsense", "15:53", "something floating around right so", "15:55", "here's what they saw so that you know", "15:56", "the way we discover planets is we look", "15:58", "for when the the planets passes in front", "16:00", "of the star you get a little dip in the", "16:02", "light right it blocks out a little bit", "16:03", "like a little Eclipse um and so you know", "16:06", "we now that's how we know that every", "16:07", "star in the sky has planets but there's", "16:09", "like they found one that just made no", "16:11", "sense like the light would dip then", "16:13", "would stop dipping then would dip again", "16:14", "three times and would stop dipping", "16:15", "sometimes it was lower sometimes it was", "16:16", "higher and you know for a year so people", "16:20", "you know and so you know Jason right now", "16:24", "there's a Jason's a friend of mine you", "16:25", "know they wrote a paper where they're", "16:26", "like hey you know at least because this", "16:29", "is what the futures gonna look like we", "16:30", "can't say we can't we have to at least", "16:32", "consider the possibility that these are", "16:34", "artificial structures that are like", "16:36", "orbiting the star or you know it would", "16:38", "have to be ungodly huge ungodly huge", "16:41", "alien mega structures like that's the", "16:42", "best word like the size of a country", "16:44", "right yeah yeah these things would be", "16:46", "huge right but that's what people think", "16:47", "like you know when people think about", "16:48", "advanced alien civilizations the idea of", "16:51", "building large-scale structures is you", "16:54", "think that maybe the next thing you do", "16:55", "once you reach a certain point like um", "16:57", "you know the Dyson Sphere the idea you", "16:59", "could collect all of the sun's energy", "17:01", "and use it for yourself by building a", "17:03", "giant sphere around the Sun with solar", "17:05",

"17:12", "natural progression of civilizations", "17:13", "that goes first you collect all the", "17:15", "energy you can from your planet and then", "17:17", "you use that to do amazing things and", "17:18", "then you collect all the energy from", "17:20", "your star and then you do that you know", "17:21", "you do amazing shit with that and then", "17:23", "you know the whole galaxy so he you know", "17:25", "Kardashev thought there was a scale that", "17:27", "that civilizations naturally progress", "17:29", "through and so hopefully don't blow", "17:30", "yourself up along the way well I think", "17:32", "that's the question you know I've", "17:33", "criticized that called the Kardashev", "17:34", "scale in one of the papers I recently", "17:35", "did because what it fails to take into", "17:37", "account is the fact that like you know", "17:38", "on your way up to the type one type one", "17:40", "is when you harvest all the energy from", "17:42", "your planet which basically means", "17:43", "somehow covering your planet in you know", "17:47", "solar panels or something that neglects", "17:49", "what we've learned since Carter Chef", "17:50", "wrote his paper in 64 is that you know", "17:52", "planets don't like that", "17:53", "like planets a plant's gonna feedback", "17:54", "you try and build you know massive shit", "17:56", "on your planet the planet has its own", "17:58", "your biosphere is pretty powerful and", "18:00", "you got to take the biosphere and", "18:01", "account or you get climate change you", "18:02", "get you know they ant the planet being", "18:03", "pushed off in another direction so but", "18:05", "whatever so for the UM for the alien", "18:07", "megastructures people felt like oh maybe", "18:08", "this is like a piece of a Dyson Sphere", "18:11", "right this is like you know now so you", "18:13", "know when he proposed this people went", "18:15", "bonkers over this right he was just", "18:16", "saying he's like look here's the 15", "18:18", "different things could be and I'm gonna", "18:19", "have to at least consider the", "18:20", "possibility that it's artificial but for", "18:24", "me and some people got really this is", "18:26", "why they get angry because there's been", "18:28", "a thing in the community over the years", "18:30", "you know said he got a bad name right", "18:32", "SETI for a bunch of said he was sort of", "18:34", "thought as being like only wackadoodles", "18:36", "do that but why why is that just because", "18:38", "there was no results I just think you", "18:41", "know it was you notice it's because a", "18:43", "shitty TV you know I mean I reel it in", "18:45", "some ways right it's all you know it's", "18:46", "prosthetic foreheads right it's the", "18:48", "whole we've had so much kind of crappy", "18:50", "you know speculation about aliens that", "18:53", "trying to do anything scientific always", "18:55", "had this whiff of sort of being a little", "18:57", "you know and then there's the UFO stuff", "18:59", "you know which is completely separate", "19:00", "has nothing to do with it but said he", "19:02", "never really achieved any results right", "19:04", "there was that one big blip that was", "19:07", "highly popularize wow signal yeah but", "19:10", "here's the thing about city we never", "19:11", "really did SETI that much you know I", "19:13", "mean like people have this idea like wow", "19:14", "we've got telescopes all over the world", "19:16", "and they're looking you know so the", "19:17", "government never funded a SETI study I", "19:20", "Ben ething major right so people you", "19:22", "know all that SETI has done is like", "19:24", "basically you know some dudes on a", "19:25", "telescope get a little extra time like", "19:27", "hey man quit let's go look at a star you", "19:29", "know so um Jill tarter who's one of the", "19:31", "you know that founders one of the", "19:32", "Great's of SETI she compares it's like", "19:35", "you know we got a notion that we need to", "19:36", "look at and wait so far we've looked at", "19:38", "a thimble right was she the Jodie Foster", "19:40", "carries the Jodie Foster character yet", "19:41", "in a contact yeah yeah so she's late on", "19:44", "it's a good point like we haven't really", "19:46", "looked yet so the idea that you know the", "19:48", "stars are silent or anything it's like", "19:50", "man come on we haven't even begun to do", "19:53", "a comprehensive service said he makes me", "19:54", "sad", "19:55", "why because I feel like they're wasting", "19:57", "their time and there's a there was a", "19:59", "documentary I saw once about some", "20:02", "biologist who was convinced that the", "20:04", "giant sloth was still alive", "20:06", "and that there was examples of them in", "20:08", "South America and this poor bastard had", "20:10", "spent more than a decade looking for", "20:14", "this giant sloth in South America and", "20:16", "there was there's this moment where he", "20:20", "was chasing down this supposed dung pile", "20:24", "and they were looking for and they were", "20:25", "thinking about yeah and he had this look", "20:28", "in his eyes where like he was like holy", "20:30", "shit what if I waste my fucking life", "20:32", "yeah in my academic career chasing down", "20:36", "something that's not even real yeah", "20:37", "that's kind of how I've always felt", "20:38", "about SETI yeah but that's not the way", "20:40", "the people I mean everybody was involved", "20:41", "in it um Your Honor do SETI you know I", "20:44", "mean you know I respect the people are", "20:45", "doing it it's not yeah but you know most", "20:47", "of them are like look this is just a", "20:49", "monkey generational thing you know and", "20:51", "if even if I don't find it I'm laying", "20:52", "the foundation concealer all's right it", "20:54", "took like how many generations did it", "20:56", "take to build a cathedral in medieval", "20:57", "Europe right so the first guy who laid", "20:59", "the stone was like I'm not gonna see", "21:00", "this yeah maybe my great-grand kid so", "21:02", "most of them are like you know they're", "21:04", "you know they know that this is gonna", "21:05", "you know this is a this is a huge like", "21:07", "the most important question in humanity", "21:09", "right why are we alone and they're", "21:10", "willing to accept that like you know", "21:12", "it's gonna do it scientifically you're", "21:14", "gonna have to do it brick by fricking", "21:15", "brick you know and so you just have to", "21:17", "accept that and you know go on so but", "21:20", "like I said I think we've you know this", "21:22", "is a new era now so the idea of like", "21:23", "looking for signals which assumes that", "21:25", "somebody's putting out signals right", "21:26", "that's that's a huge assumption right", "21:28", "there but it would now that we know that", "21:30", "there's all these planets and we're", "21:31", "staring at all these planets it's kind", "21:33", "of we need to be thinking differently", "21:34", "about you know we need to be prepared", "21:36", "for like what happens when we see", "21:38", "something we don't understand", "21:39", "well it's also we don't even use radio", "21:41", "anymore right right cable radio is dying", "21:44", "right slowly but surely yeah", "21:46", "local radio is yeah I mean it's it's", "21:49", "kind of a thing of the past", "21:50", "yeah right the only thing that's really", "21:52", "we're beaming out a large scale is", "21:53", "military radars you know that's the main", "21:56", "thing", "21:56", "so there'd be some kind of signal", "21:59", "wouldn't necessarily have to be radar or", "22:01", "radio just have to be something that we", "22:04", "could detect right some formula", "22:05", "nominally that seemed to be artificial", "22:07", "right so here's like here's some of the", "22:08", "suggestions that people are talking", "22:09", "about so ovule obit Harvard talks about", "22:11", "the idea you know maybe what you need", "22:13", "and you're gonna need the sensitivity", "22:15", "for this you're gonna see like rocket", "22:16", "engines going back and forth between you", "22:18", "know", "22:18", "but you have a planet you haven't a", "22:20", "multi-planet civilization on in some and", "22:23", "you're gonna see little flares as", "22:24", "Rockets decelerate and accelerate back", "22:25", "and forth people talk about seeing city", "22:27", "lights you know the telescope's are", "22:29", "getting you know we're building these", "22:31", "giant telescopes they're like 30 meters", "22:33", "it may be a potential one day to see you", "22:36", "could see city lights you know there", "22:37", "you're gonna see the planet come around", "22:38", "like this is all like you know we're not", "22:40", "we're not there yet but um people 20", "22:42", "years 30 years 30 years 40 years yeah", "22:44", "this is a long game and you got to be", "22:46", "playing the long game at some point", "22:47", "we're gonna need to build stuff in space", "22:48", "that's even larger so we can collect", "22:50", "more light and won't the issue also be", "22:51", "that if we do see these city lights", "22:53", "we're seeing city lights from millions", "22:54", "of years ago well it depends like you", "22:56", "tend you know a planets that that's in a", "22:58", "star ten light years ago that's ten", "23:00", "years ago so it's not like you know", "23:01", "these things could still be around", "23:02", "here's a really interesting idea like", "23:05", "because you know one of the things that", "23:06", "I'm talking about my book is like how", "23:07", "long does any civilization last right", "23:09", "that's the real quiet is rest super", "23:12", "relevant for us now because the question", "23:14", "is what is the average lifetime of a", "23:16", "civilization so you might be able to see", "23:18", "artifacts from civilizations that are", "23:20", "gone like imagine of civilization", "23:22", "covered one of its moons in solar panels", "23:25", "right the reflected light is going to", "23:28", "show a spectral signature of the the", "23:31", "panel's you know so it's like you they", "23:33", "don't even have to necessarily be alive", "23:34", "now that we still might be able to see", "23:36", "stuff from there you know our evidence", "23:38", "of like artificial structures or", "23:40", "something that's not natural around them", "23:42", "so you know that's the thing man it's", "23:43", "like we're really we're just we're about", "23:45", "to take this step instead in", "23:47", "astrobiology where we're you know we're", "23:50", "already running models of uh EXO", "23:52", "biosphere it's right which we're asking", "23:54", "like what kind of chemistry can you have", "23:55", "if you don't like if you have", "23:56", "photosynthesis and it's our on a planet", "23:59", "around a star that's smaller than ours", "24:01", "that stars gonna be mostly red as", "24:02", "opposed to yellow like our so the light", "24:04", "that's coming off it is gonna be", "24:05", "different can you have photosynthesis in", "24:06", "that case some people like yeah you", "24:07", "probably could what would it look like", "24:09", "so we're already doing the work to be", "24:11", "ready for EXO biospheres so EXO", "24:14", "civilizations we kind of need to be", "24:16", "prepared for that too looking for you", "24:18", "know what could be the traces what might", "24:19", "we see from a distance from an EXO", "24:21", "civilization they don't have to be", "24:22", "signaling us you know they're just there", "24:24", "and we're gonna catch some aspect of", "24:26", "their being around even if we did see", "24:28", "rocket if we did see some sort of a", "24:31", "signature from raw", "24:32", "it's going back and forth or the we", "24:35", "would have to assume that this is a", "24:36", "similarly aged civilization to ours", "24:39", "whereas if we saw something that was a", "24:41", "thousand a hundred thousand years", "24:43", "advanced we probably wouldn't see that", "24:45", "anymore probably see some sort of a", "24:47", "manipulation of time and space right if", "24:49", "that's possible everybody possibly if", "24:51", "it's possible yeah yeah so that's I mean", "24:53", "of course that is one of the problems is", "24:54", "that um when you start you know when you", "24:56", "start pushing it's just like saying like", "24:58", "you know what is the water is that what", "24:59", "are we gonna be like in a million years", "25:00", "no it's you know I mean it's so long so", "25:03", "I think you start with what you know and", "25:05", "the cool thing about the planet part", "25:07", "though is that you know unless they", "25:08", "become like energy beings you know", "25:10", "they're gonna have an effect on their", "25:12", "planet so looking at their planets to", "25:14", "look for you know for spectral", "25:16", "indications that's prior even after they", "25:17", "die there might even be things so that's", "25:19", "I think a you know a good way to go yeah", "25:22", "I'm yeah I'm so curious as to what we're", "25:25", "going to be able to do in a thousand", "25:27", "years in ten thousand years and a", "25:29", "hundred thousand years if civilization", "25:31", "does stale around and we figure out how", "25:33", "to not melt the earth right boil the", "25:36", "oceans or whatever whatever the folly of", "25:38", "the ground we're doing Yeah right", "25:39", "but there's you know a bunch of science", "25:42", "fiction films that do speculated what", "25:43", "what's going to be possible in the", "25:45", "future and one of them was was that", "25:47", "recent one with what's-his-name all", "25:50", "right all right what's his name the", "25:52", "fuck's his name McConaughey the one", "25:56", "where they go through the wormholes", "25:58", "right how much do those movies piss you", "26:00", "off but they don't I don't know I I do", "26:02", "not mean but they gets of science", "26:04", "fiction so you know I mean I do not need", "26:07", "my science fiction to be correct to be", "26:09", "correct I mean it's you know if they", "26:10", "want to make it you know so I love the", "26:12", "expanse the expanse is my favorite show", "26:13", "ever I will talk about it what is the", "26:15", "expanse the expanse I don't even know", "26:17", "yes thank you help me so the expanse", "26:20", "it's a series of books first of all that", "26:22", "I think are the best science fiction", "26:23", "books in the last 15 years and then they", "26:25", "made him into it made it into a show on", "26:27", "sci-fi and then had three years of it", "26:30", "and you know at first people were like", "26:31", "oh it's kind of hard to follow cuz you", "26:32", "know it's a lot of stories coming", "26:33", "together and then you know if this year", "26:36", "it got a hundred percent ratings or what", "26:41", "is it rotten tomatoes rotten tomatoes a", "26:42", "hundred or ninety five percent like if", "26:43", "people love show any friggin sci-fi", "26:45", "cancelled it you know and so the Jeff", "26:47", "Bezos just yeah Jeff piezo just picked", "26:49", "it up oh because people yeah tell you", "26:53", "why this show is amazing right so um it", "26:56", "takes place about two hundred years from", "26:57", "now and we are truly a multi-planet", "26:59", "species like Mars now has you know you", "27:01", "know billion people on it and it's", "27:03", "become its own political power right", "27:04", "it's separated from the earth and then", "27:06", "the asteroid belt has also people are", "27:08", "colonizing and you know living on the", "27:10", "asteroid belt to you know my niece or", "27:11", "tsa's but the belters as they call them", "27:14", "are like they're like second-class", "27:15", "citizens they're basically like super", "27:17", "poor and there be other they got the", "27:19", "boot on their necks by either earth or", "27:21", "Mars and so there's this whole", "27:22", "interplanetary kind of political shit", "27:25", "going on which is just great you know", "27:27", "and then there's you enter into this", "27:30", "they discover like the what they call", "27:32", "the proto molecule like you know it was", "27:34", "this is basically this alien molecule", "27:36", "that was really a device that some", "27:38", "aliens threw our way billions of years", "27:40", "ago that was you know I don't know how", "27:42", "much my supposed to give away you know I", "27:43", "don't want I said no that's what so", "27:44", "close no one's gonna remember good good", "27:46", "so complicated so that you know that", "27:49", "becomes kind of a weapon in this this", "27:52", "political intrigue so it's just a great", "27:54", "stories kind of people call it like the", "27:55", "game of Thrones in space mmm but I'll", "27:57", "tell you what I love about it is that", "27:58", "this is what its gonna look like like", "28:00", "they get the science on this show so", "28:02", "write as much as you can right so you", "28:05", "know in space if your rocket motors are", "28:07", "on there's gravity because you know the", "28:08", "rocket motors push up towards you until", "28:10", "you got grabbed you can walk around when", "28:12", "you turn the rocket motors off you float", "28:13", "around right on spinning things you know", "28:16", "anything so you know in the in this", "28:17", "universe you know in this the fictional", "28:19", "universe they've taken the big asteroids", "28:21", "and they've hollowed them out and spun", "28:23", "them up so people live on the inside you", "28:25", "know and so one point like that one of", "28:27", "the characters that the Private Eye they", "28:29", "got this great sort of film noir thing", "28:31", "going on and He pours a drink you know", "28:32", "some whiskey and the whiskey does this", "28:34", "it spirals into this so they got the", "28:36", "coriolis uh like I peed my pants", "28:39", "Coriolis effect right so it's like this", "28:42", "is really what its gonna look like you", "28:44", "know I mean this is if you want to",

"31:40", "saying man like what you read a book", "31:43", "because they'll say stuff like here's my", "31:44", "favorite one climate always changing hey", "31:46", "man claims who's changing man which is", "31:47", "true yeah so if somebody comes to me", "31:50", "because you know what I want most for", "31:51", "people like I consider myself an", "31:52", "evangelist of science I love science and", "31:55", "so if people come to me they say hey man", "31:56", "isn't the climate always changing I'm", "31:58", "like oh great question you know we", "31:59", "actually know the answer to that yeah", "32:00", "it's changing but it's changing what's", "32:03", "the time scale you know so it changes", "32:05", "often on million-year timescales but", "32:07", "like from the the last ten thousand", "32:09", "years since the last ice age which was", "32:11", "ten thousand years ago which is amazing", "32:12", "like there use to be a mile of ice above", "32:14", "our heads you know ten thousand years", "32:16", "ago climate has been remarkably stable", "32:18", "yeah it's been little blips in it but no", "32:20", "major changes right so like and I can", "32:22", "show them the graph of this and", "32:23", "everything so if you're if you know if", "32:25", "they're interested you know I mean if", "32:26", "they're so if they're asking the", "32:27", "question because they want to know I'm", "32:28", "all I'm down to talk until the cows come", "32:31", "home but that's not what the typical", "32:32", "deniers are deniers like you climate", "32:34", "changing little time but they're not", "32:35", "interested in the answer but isn't it", "32:37", "it's not only they're not interested in", "32:38", "the answer they're just trying to win", "32:41", "it's not a real conversation because", "32:43", "it's a really complex thing if you dig", "32:46", "an ice core and you you tap down to", "32:50", "fifty thousand eighty thousand a hundred", "32:52", "thousand years you see all these bizarre", "32:54", "shifts of the climate right that could", "32:56", "be indicative of super volcanoes and", "32:59", "asteroid impacts and solar flares a lot", "33:01", "of shit happens", "33:02", "yeah over the course of a million years", "33:04", "right but to hang all your ideas on the", "33:11", "parties ideology and to deny all this", "33:14", "really interesting stuff and and and all", "33:17", "these variables that's what that's what", "33:20", "pisses me off it's like you know what I", "33:21", "try and tell people's like look climate", "33:22", "science is like awesome like it's", "33:24", "it's got these amazing stories to tell", "33:27", "about you know yeah the earth I mean", "33:29", "earth over the past 4.5 billion years", "33:31", "the earth has gone through the most", "33:31", "profound changes and we've learned about", "33:34", "aren't you interested in that but no", "33:36", "right there they basically have this", "33:38", "thing we're like you know I'm part of", "33:40", "this group and therefore I have to have", "33:42", "this opinion and I'm like dude it's", "33:43", "science science doesn't care who you", "33:44", "voted for you know I mean like the", "33:46", "radiative properties of a co2 molecule", "33:49", "doesn't care whether you're wearing a", "33:50", "blue tie or a red tie and the fact that", "33:52", "people can't make that distinction and", "33:53", "here's the real problem once you go down", "33:55", "this slippery road of denying saying", "33:57", "like okay that kind of science I hate", "33:59", "man they're all a hoax well you know", "34:01", "America's prosperity and our safety has", "34:04", "been built on science over the last 200", "34:06", "years you know you start to erode the", "34:07", "whole thing you can't just like call one", "34:09", "group of VO scientists hoaxsters you", "34:11", "know and it's all they're only doing for", "34:13", "learn and not have it slowly infect", "34:15",

of money into science they're", "34:22", "not doing this so like you know we're", "34:24", "limiting and here's the other thing that", "34:25", "really bums me out", "34:26", "science is not a it's not a lunch buffet", "34:29", "you know I mean you can't be like oh man", "34:31", "can I have some of those antibiotics I", "34:32", "love antibiotics and oh yeah the", "34:33", "cellphones great I'll use that I really", "34:35", "want to fly in a plane but climate", "34:36", "change is bullshit you know I mean like", "34:39", "you know either you accept that you live", "34:41", "in a scientific society doesn't mean", "34:42", "like your slavish Lee adhere to anything", "34:44", "you know comes out in the journal it", "34:45", "yesterday but you know either you adhere", "34:47", "to the idea this method has produced", "34:49", "miracles for us or you know give me the", "34:51", "cell phone back well the scientific", "34:54", "method is what has established the", "34:57", "actual real facts of how things interact", "35:01", "with each other that's allowed us to", "35:02", "create technology right I think they", "35:04", "they split that distinction right they", "35:06", "focus on the technology and commerce", "35:08", "right which is more important right", "35:10", "their eyes than the the the consequences", "35:14", "of the environment all right what's", "35:16", "going to happen to the environment there", "35:19", "this is the big hope is that we're gonna", "35:20", "figure it out and I'm hopeful of that", "35:22", "too is that we're going to figure out", "35:23", "some way to extract carbon from the", "35:25", "atmosphere with devices or some enormous", "35:28", "like there was some I don't know if it", "35:31", "was a working prototype or it's just a", "35:32", "concept but there was an enormous", "35:34", "building that was really an air filter", "35:36", "yeah yeah they're starting to look at", "35:38", "carbon yeah sure", "35:39", "with places like Hong Kong and right", "35:41", "places where they have Terra Beijing and", "35:43", "they have terrible terrible pollution", "35:44", "and more importantly particulates in the", "35:46", "atmosphere yeah so it's not just a like", "35:49", "a carbon thing it's like they have shit", "35:51", "in their air breathing awful man it's", "35:55", "you know I went to Mexico City a couple", "35:58", "years back I've been there twice but I", "36:00", "went there for a UFC and when we're", "36:01", "flying in I took photos and I put them", "36:03", "on my Instagram seat you see you find", "36:05", "those they're fucking shocked it's", "36:07", "unbelievable right what kind of a creepy", "36:10", "animal is the human where the human is", "36:13", "capable of burning smoke yeah into the", "36:16", "very air that I need to take into our", "36:18", "lungs to keep our body a lot oh you see", "36:21", "it's so bad people have never been to", "36:23", "Mexico City yeah like it's a stunner", "36:24", "dude my fucking head was killing me", "36:27", "after two days there yeah that's what", "36:28", "like have with the Beijing when they had", "36:29", "the Olympics right they had to like you", "36:31", "know they had to stop all industrial", "36:32", "activity for like this months right this", "36:34", "is LA used to look like this right", "36:36", "before the Clean Air Act LA when I wrote", "36:38", "I wrote Mexico's LA on steroids Mexico", "36:41", "cities LA on steroids just so dark you", "36:44", "know the this whole question of what", "36:45", "we'll do like this brings us back to the", "36:47", "aliens right what so my point is is that", "36:50", "you know we're not the first time this", "36:51", "has happened yet pretty much if you", "36:53", "build the civilization anybody who", "36:55", "builds a civilization like we've done is", "36:57", "gonna trigger climate change right it's", "36:59", "like it's kind of unavoidable right so", "37:01", "that goes back to the denier thing and", "37:02", "one of things I'm trying to his book is", "37:03", "flip the script right cuz you talked to", "37:05", "climate denialists", "37:05", "and it's the same freaking set of things", "37:07", "that like you know man dude we've been", "37:09", "here before we've questioned is that", "37:10", "answered but I'm trying to like flip it", "37:12", "to show that like the whole question of", "37:14", "you know did we change the climate", "37:16", "that's why everybody focuses on did we", "37:17", "to be not you know right and you know", "37:19", "from when you take the 10,000 light your", "37:21", "view then what you realize is like what", "37:23", "did you expect like we built a world", "37:25", "girdling civilization that uses a", "37:26", "quarter almost of all the energy the", "37:28", "biosphere uses right so you know every", "37:31", "you know everyday the biosphere has like", "37:32", "you know 200 terawatts of energy that", "37:35", "it's producing in sugars we use about a", "37:37", "quarter of that like how did you expect", "37:39", "there wasn't gonna be an impact so this", "37:42", "changes the whole way we're looking we", "37:43", "don't need to argue about like did we or", "37:45", "didn't we of course we did this is what", "37:47", "happens when you reach this level and", "37:48", "the other thing that you know in the", "37:50", "book that I'm trying to argue", "37:51", "also and it pushes back against the", "37:53", "deniers is like what climate deniers are", "37:55", "human haters you know they're all like", "37:56", "you know like that you know we did this", "37:58", "amazing thing we changed the atmosphere", "38:00", "of an entire planet right climate change", "38:02", "shows on one level how freaking awesome", "38:04", "we are you know how far we've gotten and", "38:06", "is if you look at the you know from the", "38:08", "perspective of you know species doing", "38:10", "this again and again across the universe", "38:12", "this shows that we've reached a level", "38:14", "right we have we've leveled up right you", "38:16", "don't play a lot of video games right", "38:17", "and so that whole thing when you level", "38:18", "up and you know you get that the sniper", "38:19", "rifle we've leveled up and so now the", "38:22", "question is are we smart enough you know", "38:24", "to see what we've done", "38:25", "and make the right choices because", "38:27", "that's what the universe is going to be", "38:28", "there's gonna be species at the trigger", "38:29", "climate change is gonna happen all time", "38:31", "and some are gonna be like oh man we", "38:33", "need to do something right and they'll", "38:34", "make the actions they'll be able to work", "38:35", "it out get it together and other ones", "38:37", "you know we're just gonna end up in the", "38:38", "cosmic waste pile so we're like cosmic", "38:40", "teenagers and just like when you're a", "38:41", "teenager and you're you know you start", "38:43", "to drive right either you figure it out", "38:45", "you know either you're drinking and", "38:47", "you're partying and drive the car off a", "38:48", "cliff or you figure out how to handle", "38:50", "your responsibility and that's us now", "38:51", "yeah yeah no I agree with you and I feel", "38:55", "like there's a fundamental problem with", "38:57", "the way people approach ideas and I", "39:00", "think it goes back to what we're talking", "39:01", "about earlier about right versus left or", "39:03", "yeah you know Republican versus Democrat", "39:05", "they're not thinking the consequences of", "39:07", "arguing for against the possibility that", "39:10", "climate change is a human cause thing", "39:12", "they're not thinking of the consequences", "39:13", "they just want to win right right and", "39:15", "want their side to be they want their", "39:16", "side to be right and that you know what", "39:18", "what bums me out is they don't", "39:19", "understand the the consequences of that", "39:21", "for the both the American enterprise and", "39:23", "the human Enterprise right I mean", "39:25", "because you know if you if you keep", "39:28", "calling one branch of science a hoax", "39:31", "then what's to say the other branch is", "39:33", "like well you know then you just you're", "39:34", "down you're rolling down this you know", "39:35", "slippery slope or like the other", "39:37", "countries you know like so most of the", "39:39", "of the Nobel Prizes Americans have won", "39:42", "were people from other countries they", "39:43", "came here to do their science because we", "39:45", "had the best scientific enterprise know", "39:47", "the next generation we'll just go", "39:49", "somewhere else I'll go to China you know", "39:50", "so there's that part of it and the other", "39:53", "part is like dude it's just science it", "39:55", "doesn't care about your political views", "39:58", "and you know it's not fair to use the", "40:00", "cell phone and take the antibiotics and", "40:02", "then turn around and like and then", "40:04", "suddenly treat this thing as", "40:05", "it was another thing in your bucket of", "40:06", "you know ideologies I think also people", "40:08", "think if you somehow another compromise", "40:11", "industries ability to to work that", "40:14", "you're gonna kill jobs and you're gonna", "40:16", "damage the economy and that's more", "40:18", "important yeah but I think it's the", "40:19", "exact opposite right and if people", "40:21", "really saw right I mean um you know", "40:23", "again just like I'm saying climate", "40:25", "change shows how powerful people's", "40:27", "become it also shows how powerful our", "40:28", "enterprise right we did this by you know", "40:31", "building businesses by building", "40:33", "enterprise by and we built this world", "40:36", "girdling machine of civilization and it", "40:39", "you know it the planet actually noticed", "40:41", "why do you like that term world girdling", "40:43", "because that's it gives me the turtle", "40:47", "because it's from like Shakespeare like", "40:50", "from Caesar or something I was thought", "40:52", "it wasn't good but it's the idea that", "40:54", "like you know in the foundation trilogy", "40:56", "the Isaac gazzman off you know classic", "40:57", "science fiction thing there's the city", "40:59", "of the Planet of Trant or which is the", "41:01", "center of the the Empire the Galactic", "41:03", "Empire and it's a you know it's", "41:04", "basically the whole planets been covered", "41:06", "in City you know like the other planet", "41:08", "you got to go down like five hundred", "41:09", "levels before you get to the the surface", "41:11", "so that idea you know I mean what I like", "41:13", "about it is the idea that like you know", "41:14", "we've done something we're kind of", "41:16", "covered the planet in our our effect you", "41:19", "know covered the planet in our", "41:20", "enterprise so this issue a business is", "41:22", "that like um there's a place I can stand", "41:25", "in Rochester I did this for M PR and", "41:26", "there's the Erie Canal I can stand right", "41:28", "on the edge of the Erie Canal then", "41:29", "there's a train tracks", "41:31", "you know the tracks was laid those", "41:32", "tracks were laid back in the original", "41:34", "line back in the eighteenth you know", "41:35", "whatever 70s then there's a highway and", "41:37", "then there's the airport right over", "41:39", "there for different infrastructures you", "41:41", "know which everyone took huge amounts of", "41:43", "money to build one of which we don't", "41:45", "even use anymore right so the idea of", "41:47", "building an infrastructure that will", "41:50", "that will not be carbon polluting will", "41:52", "not trigger climate change like did this", "41:54", "is what we do you know so the idea that", "41:56", "there's gonna be more jobs that come out", "41:58", "of this than it could ever come out of", "41:59", "fossil fuels you know it's not a big", "42:02", "deal for human beings cuz that's what we", "42:04", "do to switch infrastructures and there", "42:07", "will be a lot of wealth generated out by", "42:08", "you know just like there was you know", "42:10", "when we switched to the trains where's", "42:12", "the argument coming that we because", "42:14", "there are people that just adopt the", "42:16", "party line the party line that you know", "42:18", "he", "42:18", "climates always changed and human beings", "42:20", "barely affected and it's not something", "42:22", "to concentrate on where's that coming", "42:23", "from", "42:24", "again I think it's the you know the", "42:26", "gradual political polo polarization of", "42:28", "everything you know because you look at", "42:30", "in the we're now at the what is it 30", "42:33", "year anniversary of Jim Hanson who was", "42:36", "you know the famous climate scientist", "42:37", "giving his testimony in front of", "42:38", "Congress in 1988 hot sweltering summer", "42:40", "day we said climate change is already", "42:42", "happening", "42:42", "you know and that made news everyone", "42:44", "that was the first like public awakening", "42:47", "that this was happening and if you look", "42:48", "at the first Bush administration they", "42:49", "were like oh yeah we're ready to do", "42:50", "something about this sure we can do it", "42:51", "you know and then it just gradually over", "42:54", "time as the whole political polarization", "42:56", "thing happened you can actually see the", "42:58", "the very purposeful denial right they", "43:01", "took a page out of the cigarette", "43:02", "companies you know it's four years right", "43:04", "cigarettes were like other cigarette", "43:05", "companies were like now it's not a", "43:06", "problem so they were purposefully you", "43:08", "know there were people had money", "43:09", "invested right you know like there's a", "43:12", "documentary that that goes into that", "43:14", "what is the name of that merchants of", "43:17", "doubt' merchants of doubt' yeah that's a", "43:19", "great smoke man that's a really good", "43:20", "book yeah and the documentary is really", "43:22", "good yeah it was purposeful that's it's", "43:25", "also confusing it's like why are they", "43:27", "doing that like who's paying them to do", "43:29", "that obviously the cigarette companies", "43:30", "would be paying the same people right to", "43:32", "put doubt in to the idea that cigarettes", "43:36", "are addictive or cigarettes cause cancer", "43:37", "and this is what had been done in the", "43:39", "past now the same people are involved in", "43:42", "doing it with climate change right but", "43:43", "why well you know at one time I wrote a", "43:46", "piece for the NPR there was kind of", "43:48", "positive about like yeah we can switch", "43:49", "infrastructures like I'm saying and some", "43:51", "guy wrote me back very angry and he said", "43:53", "you know the proven reserves you know", "43:55", "the stuff the oil that's in the ground", "43:56", "has a wealth you know has a valve on", "43:59", "eteri value like they're you know that's", "44:01", "in there in the oil companies banks you", "44:03", "know that in their bank accounts of like", "44:05", "1.5 trillion dollars and I said dude you", "44:07", "know people have gotten to war for a lot", "44:09", "less than 1.5 trillion dollars so you", "44:11", "know if we were to really be like hey", "44:13", "man we can't burn that you know you're", "44:15", "gonna have to leave that in the ground", "44:16", "that's like do their bank accounts going", "44:18", "like you know zero pretty fast so what I", "44:21", "don't so it's those industries I think", "44:23", "that's part of it and then it gets you", "44:25", "get linked to other things and then it", "44:26", "becomes this sort of like mass", "44:28", "uh you know becomes the political poet", "44:30", "they use the political polarization to", "44:32", "sort of you know sort of make this", "44:33", "happen it doesn't and you look other", "44:35", "countries aren't doing this right that's", "44:36", "the important thing you know other", "44:37", "countries there's always a little bit of", "44:39", "climate denial going on but we're like", "44:40", "the only country that's guys you can see", "44:42", "cuz we're the only ones who are not part", "44:43", "of the Paris Accord well it's one of the", "44:45", "weirder things about this right left", "44:46", "things the left is always supporting the", "44:48", "environment the left is all about the", "44:50", "environment the left is about clean air", "44:52", "and clean water the whole thing is very", "44:57", "strange well I got you know I mean I", "44:59", "have issues with you know", "45:00", "environmentalists too because um I think", "45:03", "one of your shows I was watching you", "45:05", "know the whole idea of eco bro it's", "45:06", "right and you get eco broad by people", "45:07", "and have you guys I have a piece in The", "45:08", "New York Times today an op-ed where I'm", "45:10", "basically saying like look man the", "45:12", "planets gonna be fine like you know long", "45:13", "term there's nothing we can throw at the", "45:15", "biosphere that it's gonna kill it weird", "45:17", "it's not about saving the planet the", "45:18", "earth it's not a fuzzy little bunny", "45:20", "you know the planet is powerful and it's", "45:23", "really about saving us let's be honest", "45:24", "about what's going on there's gonna be", "45:25", "all kinds of ethical choices that go on", "45:27", "that you know the polar bears may not be", "45:28", "able to come along with us on the ride", "45:30", "here you know we need a healthy", "45:32", "biosphere would've you know a lot of", "45:34", "biodiversity but you know we're part of", "45:36", "it and we're gonna have an impact", "45:37", "there's no such thing as no impact and", "45:38", "you know already I'm getting an eco bro", "45:40", "do you just you know you don't care", "45:42", "about life yeah come on I just put it in", "45:45", "the thing I said we need to be wise and", "45:47", "compassionate you know but they're like", "45:49", "no people have convenient opinions I", "45:51", "mean this is this is one of the things", "45:53", "you get involved with when you start", "45:56", "talking with people about really", "45:58", "important issues it mean it's like we", "46:00", "were talking about earlier they want to", "46:01", "be right yeah and they want to be on the", "46:04", "side that's righteous and with virtue", "46:05", "and ethics right right they find", "46:07", "anything that you disagree that they", "46:10", "disagree with that you're saying they", "46:11", "don't ask you questions they don't go", "46:13", "what do you think the implications are", "46:15", "or how do you how do we minimize the", "46:17", "effects and the negative consequences of", "46:18", "our they just immediately want to say", "46:21", "you are insensitive you are an asshole", "46:24", "you are the problem yeah you know my way", "46:27", "around that and it's what the whole book", "46:28", "is about is to like when you've got a", "46:29", "polarization right you know where you", "46:31", "know you're either this or you're that", "46:33", "the thing that this is like a", "46:34", "mathematical idea is to go orthogonal", "46:36", "you know when you when you you know you", "46:38", "go because you know it's a line based", "46:40", "right you're on this side or that side", "46:41", "go 90 degrees to it now you're in a", "46:43", "whole new space now you're up and down", "46:45", "to the left and right exactly and now", "46:47", "like the questions that so you see this", "46:49", "in like revolutions in science right so", "46:51", "you look at Ernst ein and what happened", "46:52", "when Einstein came up with relativity", "46:54", "everybody at the time was like you know", "46:56", "um they were all concerned what they", "46:57", "call the luminiferous ether that you", "46:59", "know light needed likes a wave and", "47:00", "everybody thought it needed something to", "47:02", "propagate through right radio waye are", "47:03", "um water waves go through water sound", "47:05", "wave goes through air so you know the", "47:07", "whole thing was about this ether the", "47:08", "illuminance every sir is this it exists", "47:10", "does it not exist", "47:11", "sounds like you know I'm not really", "47:12", "interested in that problem I'm gonna do", "47:14", "it he just like changed the whole thing", "47:15", "he just said look here's to new ideas", "47:17", "they have nothing to do with the", "47:18", "luminous areas either and like all the", "47:20", "old questions all the old battles kinda", "47:23", "just fell away they didn't even make", "47:24", "sense anymore so that's what I'm trying", "47:25", "to do in the book is say look when you", "47:27", "look at climate change as a planetary", "47:30", "transition a predictable planetary", "47:32", "transition the whole idea of like", "47:34", "environmentalism versus you know", "47:36", "business interests and you know right", "47:38", "the Republicans versus Democrats it just", "47:40", "doesn't you know it's not even relevant", "47:41", "anymore what matters is that this is", "47:43", "gonna happen we should have expected it", "47:45", "to happen and now the question is do we", "47:47", "become a cosmic winner or a cosmic loser", "47:49", "and we have to think about the biosphere", "47:51", "differently we have to think about our", "47:52", "place in the biosphere differently and", "47:54", "the old arguments so that's what you", "47:55", "know sometimes with climate change", "47:56", "deniers I'll throw this stuff at them", "47:58", "and it's their kind of fun to watch and", "47:59", "be like because they're expecting me to", "48:01", "say like a B and C and they've got D E", "48:03", "and F and response and I throw this", "48:04", "stuff at them and they're just like I'm", "48:07", "not doing it just to fight with climate", "48:08", "change but I think it's true but well", "48:10", "who was it that was on the podcast that", "48:12", "was talking about climate stabilization", "48:14", "techniques and that this is probably the", "48:16", "future", "48:17", "was it boy on anyway what people are", "48:22", "really worried about when when you talk", "48:24", "to people that understand the history of", "48:26", "the human race and the history of the", "48:27", "earth is climate cooling they think that", "48:29", "climate cooling is far more terrifying", "48:31", "than climate warming because if we go", "48:33", "into a giant Ice Age again yeah I mean", "48:36", "way more people gonna die terrible loss", "48:39", "of resources and it could be devastating", "48:42", "to the human race but that is is that is", "48:45", "that something you agree with", "48:46", "yeah no I don't think so I mean it's", "48:48", "true here's something interesting we're", "48:50", "kind of overdue for an ice age yeah well", "48:52", "that was the thing in the 70s they were", "48:54", "saying that we were in", "48:55", "verge of an ice age yeah I mean that you", "48:57", "know there was just a couple of guy I", "48:58", "mean I'd holster you because that that's", "48:59", "often something that climate deniers", "49:00", "will throw at you in the seventies it", "49:02", "was like there was like one or two guys", "49:03", "who said that and then it got picked up", "49:04", "on the news but the climate community at", "49:06", "that time was not like oh my god it's", "49:08", "cooling right but here's the interesting", "49:09", "thing for me and it too fits into this", "49:10", "whole idea is that like we're holding", "49:12", "off an ice age like there may never be", "49:14", "if human humanity is successful and we", "49:16", "navigate the Anthropocene you know that", "49:19", "term the Anthropocene that we've now", "49:20", "entered we've now entered the human", "49:22", "dominated era we've been for the last", "49:23", "10,000 years the geological epoch has", "49:25", "been what they call the Holocene", "49:26", "that's all of human civilization", "49:27", "happened in the whole scene you know", "49:29", "it's pretty warm it's pretty wet moist", "49:31", "you know everything's not locked up in", "49:33", "ice um and it's an interglacial period", "49:35", "and if we weren't around yet another", "49:37", "thousand three thousand five thousand", "49:39", "years would be another Ice Age but the", "49:40", "Anthropocene that we're triggering could", "49:44", "hold off ice ages forever right as long", "49:46", "as we're around there won't be another", "49:48", "Ice Age cuz we've already added enough", "49:50", "warmth to the planet that it overcomes", "49:51", "the effects that trigger an ice age so", "49:53", "like what are the ethical", "49:54", "responsibilities of that that's what I", "49:56", "try and tell the you know the", "49:57", "environmentalists like you know you got", "49:58", "this image like oh we got to save the", "49:59", "earth but they're thinking of like the", "50:01", "Holocene and it's like well you know the", "50:04", "planet even with us even if we", "50:05", "successfully keep biodiversity rich and", "50:07", "it's not gonna be the earth we started", "50:09", "with you know cuz we're here so yeah", "50:12", "what about the species that never form", "50:14", "because we held off the Ice Age you know", "50:17", "I mean forever like what about the", "50:18", "ethical responsibility though so like it", "50:20", "opens before that is a long equation", "50:22", "though isn't it", "50:24", "in what way to try to contemplate what", "50:26", "species would have existed if we allowed", "50:28", "the earth to cool and our responsibility", "50:30", "for allowing the earth to cool so the", "50:32", "the potential for new species to advance", "50:35", "fuck those species it's keeping let's", "50:37", "keep this place warm so we can stay", "50:39", "alive well I'm saying the only reason", "50:40", "I'm raising it I'm not you know I'm", "50:42", "raising that because right we are when", "50:43", "we talk about climate change what you", "50:44", "get sometimes when the environmental", "50:46", "movement is this sort of like the polar", "50:47", "bear the polar bear it's like what I'm", "50:49", "trying to say is look I love polar bears", "50:51", "kind of funny that polar bears always", "50:52", "think these polar bears will rip your", "50:53", "head off and drink your blood not only", "50:58", "that then one of the rare bears it", "50:59", "doesn't need anything but meat yeah", "51:00", "right right so it's funny that we're", "51:03", "evan is a biologist and he said like", "51:06", "when you get polar bear babies like", "51:08", "right out of the womb he said they're", "51:09", "like the like the alien from the chest", "51:11", "the chest burster Steen he said", "51:13", "literally like right out of the womb", "51:17", "we're gonna kill and eat yeah you're", "51:18", "like oh that is a fucking obviously", "51:22", "people have tamed them and fed them to", "51:24", "the point where they don't never worry", "51:26", "about your head off yeah but that's a", "51:28", "fucking predatory enormous animal yeah", "51:31", "so I'm raising that point to say like", "51:32", "look the thing we're going through now", "51:35", "is a it's an epoch-making planetary", "51:38", "transition we met and were part of it", "51:39", "right and whether or not we're still", "51:40", "part that's the question whether or not", "51:41", "we're still part of it a thousand years", "51:43", "from now you know is the big issue so", "51:45", "you know there are ethical issues about", "51:47", "the polar bear right but there are also", "51:49", "ethical issues you know there can't just", "51:51", "return the earth to some pristine state", "51:53", "we're here there's 7 billion of us you", "51:56", "know so you know you have to we're gonna", "51:58", "have to understand like there's this", "52:00", "deeper ethical question about what does", "52:01", "an earth look like that's been changed", "52:03", "by us that's healthy but us still has us", "52:05", "on it it may not have polar bears you", "52:07", "know it may have rich phytoplankton you", "52:10", "know and it may be a very species", "52:13", "diverse but some of the species may not", "52:14", "come with us so like we can't this sort", "52:16", "of like things like oh the pristine", "52:18", "earth is no more pristine earth you know", "52:20", "we've been changing the earth since we", "52:21", "were here so it's like how do we have a", "52:24", "healthy of rich healthy biosphere with", "52:26", "us and our civilization still in it and", "52:28", "the thing about things that have gone", "52:30", "extinct in the past and more than 90% of", "52:33", "everything that's ever existed is", "52:35", "extinct problem is we didn't know then", "52:37", "right we didn't have a you know a", "52:41", "checklist right like Oh spotted owl", "52:43", "check got it you know tree frog check", "52:46", "got it now we do and when one goes away", "52:49", "we kind of freak out yeah and that's you", "52:50", "know I mean we have to have compassion", "52:52", "for life because we're part of it like", "52:53", "without the compassion you know we end", "52:55", "up with as Gavin Schmidt friend of mine", "52:57", "calls economic illogical hooliganism", "53:00", "right we just do crazy were just dumping", "53:02", "shit into rivers like yeah you don't", "53:03", "have to do that man but you know what in", "53:06", "my talks on this i'll show like the", "53:07", "polar bear the lonely polar bear on the", "53:09", "island and you know like all one's", "53:11", "really you know bummed out about this", "53:12", "and they'll show like a velociraptor", "53:14", "right you know who's crying for the", "53:16", "Velociraptor right species come and go", "53:18", "so we have to you know and the earth", "53:20", "goes to these huge transitions I'm not", "53:22", "saying", "53:22", "be like don't care about those species", "53:24", "but you gotta have the bigger picture", "53:26", "with us and here's the problem that with", "53:28", "the environmental movement's you know", "53:30", "sometimes the weight gets frame it's not", "53:32", "just the environment what's the way we", "53:33", "talk about climate change we think of", "53:35", "ourselves as being a plague right human", "53:36", "beings we suck right that's the basics", "53:39", "that's the only story you we have two", "53:41", "stories it's not happening or we suck", "53:42", "and my whole thing is like that is the", "53:44", "wrong not only is that story wrong it's", "53:47", "unhelpful you know we are what the", "53:50", "biosphere is doing now you know millions", "53:53", "of years ago it was grasslands you know", "53:55", "grasslands were a new innovation and", "53:57", "they changed the planet you have a lot", "53:59", "of grass you know the biosphere evolved", "54:00", "grasslands if they swept across the", "54:03", "planet they changed how the planet", "54:04", "worked and then the earth moved on with", "54:06", "it went on to the new experiment we are", "54:08", "what the we're exactly that we are like", "54:10", "the dinosaurs or the grasslands or the", "54:12", "blue-green algae that created the oxygen", "54:14", "atmosphere and like you know we're not", "54:16", "we're you know there's no difference", "54:17", "between a city and a forest on some", "54:20", "biospheric level we don't suck the", "54:22", "question is whether we're smart enough", "54:23", "to still be part of what the what the", "54:25", "biosphere is using us to trigger you", "54:27", "know I mean you know what are your", "54:29", "thoughts on the reintroduction of", "54:32", "extinct animals through genetic cloning", "54:34", "oh you know I watched Jurassic Park like", "54:40", "with woolly mammoths yeah this is a real", "54:42", "possibility so yeah I know the close", "54:45", "ancestors of the woolly mammoth is still", "54:47", "alive right I know I'd be down for", "54:49", "seeing it in my in MedImmune the Science", "54:51", "Museum in Rochester there's a woolly", "54:53", "mammoth that they found you know you", "54:59", "know I think like depending on what you", "55:01", "do with it you know trying to", "55:02", "reintroduce it into the biosphere could", "55:04", "be a little dangerous I mean a thing", "55:06", "look climate change is is something I", "55:08", "like to say climate change is not our", "55:09", "fault and what I mean by that is we you", "55:12", "know we found fossil fuels and they were", "55:14", "awesome you know and they were just a", "55:15", "continuation of what we'd always done", "55:17", "you know and so we inadvertently climate", "55:20", "change was a mistake", "55:21", "you know now if we don't do something", "55:23", "about it it's our fault right but you", "55:25", "know and so you want to be really", "55:26", "careful about unintended consequences", "55:28", "yeah so this is my same thing with uh", "55:30", "with geoengineering people talk like oh", "55:32", "we should you know put particle", "55:34", "particulates in the atmosphere to make", "55:35", "it more", "55:36", "selectively like Mantid we triggered the", "55:38", "hope we triggered climate change because", "55:39", "you know we didn't know what we were", "55:41", "doing we didn't know what the", "55:42", "consequences when we put those particles", "55:43", "up there how do we get them out", "55:45", "well no no the wind is bad gotta keep", "55:48", "putting them in that's the problem you", "55:49", "gotta keep putting them in so what", "55:50", "happens if like one nation decides they", "55:53", "don't want to do it anymore you know and", "55:54", "the whole thing falls apart now", "55:55", "something you're gonna get massive", "55:56", "changes and so like anything like that", "55:59", "like why don't we just work on not using", "56:01", "fossil fuels like I take the hardest", "56:03", "solution that's got the most uncertainty", "56:05", "as opposed to the simpler solution which", "56:07", "just means building a different", "56:08", "infrastructure yeah well especially in", "56:10", "California I mean this is one of the", "56:12", "weirder places ever to not see solar", "56:14", "power whenever yes it never rains should", "56:17", "be everywhere everywhere most things", "56:19", "should be run on solar yeah why not man", "56:21", "you got and solar seems so efficient now", "56:23", "it's also very difficult to get it up", "56:25", "and running like I had a friend of mine", "56:27", "who had his done for four or five months", "56:29", "before he got approved Wow because he", "56:32", "said they they make it difficult on you", "56:35", "yeah which is crazy yeah to be on solar", "56:38", "power and not be on the grid yeah so you", "56:40", "know I mean these are all the kinds of", "56:41", "things that we're gonna have to work out", "56:42", "I'm hopeful people are like are you", "56:44", "hopeful or not hopeful because you know", "56:45", "I mean I ran these I did these models", "56:47", "one of the pieces of research we did we", "56:48", "modeled planets and civilizations like", "56:50", "alien civilizations we you know", "56:52", "developed a simple mathematical model", "56:54", "about you know how a civilization will", "56:56", "use that planet's resources to make more", "56:58", "babies alien babies and then how the you", "57:01", "know by using those resources your", "57:02", "feedback on the planet right and so what", "57:03", "we wanted to do was we wanted to model", "57:05", "the possible outcomes like what is the", "57:07", "generic outcome you know if I've got a", "57:09", "hundred thousand civilizations all being", "57:10", "born in different places what's the you", "57:13", "know in general what happens and what we", "57:14", "found is like basically four different", "57:16", "possibilities one was good news like in", "57:18", "these models there was like you know the", "57:20", "population shoots up the planets", "57:23", "temperature shoots up but they come to a", "57:24", "nice steady state like you know you know", "57:26", "the population stable everything's good", "57:27", "so they're in those models was hope we", "57:31", "also saw die-off we're like the", "57:32", "population you know skyrockets the", "57:34", "planet they overshoot the carrying", "57:36", "capacity of their planet and then you", "57:38", "get something like 70% of the population", "57:39", "dying off so like well you know seven", "57:41", "out of every ten people you know is gone", "57:42", "so you know but then you come to a", "57:44", "steady-state so although maybe if you", "57:46", "can survive the disaster you can you're", "57:48", "still there", "57:49", "we also probable and survivor the", "57:50", "disasters how much of the information", "57:52", "gets her store right right because you", "57:54", "think about if you're killing seven out", "57:55", "of ten people how many of those seven", "57:57", "people are the ones who know how to make", "57:58", "cell phone yeah exactly that's a dark it", "58:00", "yeah right that's what happens in a dark", "58:01", "age I remember the first time I went to", "58:02", "Europe I saw those Roman the other", "58:03", "aqueducts man like five stories tall", "58:05", "carrying water you know and by the 980", "58:08", "nobody knew how they got built yeah few", "58:10", "of those dips in human civilization", "58:12", "right and so it's not clear especially", "58:13", "with a society as complex as arts right", "58:15", "if like the food doesn't arrive in my", "58:17", "grocery store what do I do", "58:19", "right right you know I garden but you", "58:21", "know I'm not it's not enough not enough", "58:22", "right gonna keep you long yeah so for a", "58:24", "complex civilization like ours even if", "58:26", "you don't go extinct you may not be able", "58:28", "to have this kind of civilization but we", "58:31", "did find collapse we did find complete", "58:33", "like extinction curbs as well where you", "58:35", "know the population went way up and then", "58:37", "boom dropped like a stone and would even", "58:39", "we even found those we built into the", "58:41", "models possibility for the civilization", "58:42", "to switch from a high impact resource to", "58:43", "a low impact resource like fossil to", "58:45", "solar and sometimes because you know", "58:47", "planets have minds of their own you know", "58:49", "there's an internal dynamics to plan it", "58:51", "so you push them far enough and there's", "58:52", "gonna roll off so we'd have ones where", "58:54", "the the population went way up they made", "58:56", "the switch and then populations started", "58:58", "to come down the planet started to cool", "58:59", "down did you factor in random geological", "59:03", "events random solar events random this", "59:07", "was really all about just planet", "59:09", "civilization and it's feedback on the", "59:11", "planet you could we could build models", "59:13", "like that that would be one of the major", "59:15", "issues with any advanced civilizations", "59:17", "it's a matter of time before something", "59:19", "happens right as we said you know we", "59:22", "know that Mars has been hit before", "59:23", "Worth's been hit the moon's been hit", "59:25", "everything I mean the moon is one of our", "59:27", "best examples we just look at it and see", "59:30", "craters everywhere because it doesn't", "59:31", "have an environment or an atmosphere the", "59:33", "moon was built by a huge impact between", "59:35", "Earth and more on Mars like Bobby you", "59:37", "know at the beginning of the planets", "59:38", "history so yeah those happen all the", "59:40", "time I think if you get advanced oh like", "59:41", "we're on the lip of being a multi-planet", "59:43", "species right and once you do that which", "59:45", "means you become a spacefaring race then", "59:48", "I think like certainly the asteroid", "59:49", "stuff you can take care of right we've", "59:51", "already done we've identified like a", "59:52", "huge fraction of all the earth crossing", "59:55", "asteroids like we're not really sure", "59:57", "what to do about them if we find one", "59:58", "coming at us but we see some coming at", "60:00", "us all the time will they just recognize", "60:01", "them a few hours before near", "60:03", "right right but it happened a couple", "60:05", "weeks ago right and then yeah luckily it", "60:06", "always you know it passes you can I mean", "60:08", "like so ways yeah", "60:09", "so we couldn't really like you know", "60:11", "we're young enough now that if we", "60:12", "discovered one heading right towards us", "60:14", "we could just you know you know put your", "60:15", "legs between your amp you know yeah", "60:17", "between your legs and kiss your butt", "60:18", "goodbye um but but in time right two", "60:21", "hundred years from now we will have done", "60:23", "a much better job of mapping out all the", "60:24", "major roads yeah well I think so I mean", "60:27", "I'm really you know I mean if we have", "60:29", "that kind of planetary interplanetary", "60:31", "we're gonna be mapping them out just", "60:32", "because you don't want to run into more", "60:33", "you gonna be mining them what I think is", "60:35", "promising in terms of the ability to", "60:37", "prevent impacts there's a couple of", "60:40", "things I think the best one if you catch", "60:42", "it early enough there's a gravity tug we", "60:44", "just literally Park a spaceship next to", "60:46", "it and slowly have the spaceship you", "60:48", "know move you know cuz you only have to", "60:50", "is alter the trajectory a little bit you", "60:51", "know you just really have a long bond it", "60:53", "yeah and it'll you know um cuz shit in", "60:55", "space is just so vast that a little tap", "60:57", "will make it miss so the gravity Tokyo", "60:59", "you don't have to try and do the L pot", "61:01", "was it what was the movie Apocalypse one", "61:03", "with from the 90s with the space miners", "61:06", "Oh", "61:08", "Armageddon yeah thank you there was a", "61:10", "deep impact deep impact was the smart", "61:12", "one yeah rip each others off right", "61:15", "because they're both came out at the", "61:16", "same time and I know I think deep impact", "61:18", "came out first but it was developed", "61:20", "second yeah bummer to be the one that", "61:22", "like you know they both came out at the", "61:24", "same time and your movie doesn't get any", "61:26", "attention and the other one becomes like", "61:27", "a massive hit you know Wow so so like", "61:31", "you're there they drilled holes and", "61:32", "stuff and you try and blow them up but", "61:33", "then the problem there is you now have a", "61:34", "bunch of rocks and if some of those", "61:35", "rocks are big enough so I think the", "61:37", "gravity tug is kind of probably the the", "61:39", "best idea but you know because of mining", "61:41", "asteroids well probably you know those", "61:42", "little ones may be the easiest to you", "61:44", "know to mine hmm what are you worried", "61:47", "about more than anything in terms of", "61:50", "climate change like you worried about", "61:51", "the rising of the ocean levels are you", "61:54", "worried about the heating of the actual", "61:56", "planet the temperature being", "61:58", "unsustainable for human life like what", "62:00", "are you worried about the most the one", "62:02", "thing I'm worried about the most like we", "62:03", "were talking before you know", "62:04", "technological societies are these like", "62:06", "overlay networks you know you got the", "62:08", "transportation network you got the", "62:09", "energy network you got social networks", "62:11", "you know and those are really complex", "62:13", "and so I do a little what's called", "62:14", "network theory and what you find with", "62:15", "network theory", "62:16", "that you you know you may have an", "62:17", "individual Network that's pretty robust", "62:20", "meaning like I can cut some of the the", "62:22", "connections like you got your social", "62:23", "network I could take you know twenty", "62:25", "percent of the people out of your social", "62:26", "network and the social like will still", "62:27", "function you know I like to feel most", "62:29", "people will still talk to each other", "62:30", "anything but once you start layering", "62:31", "them so if the social network is now", "62:33", "connected to the telecommunications", "62:34", "network which is connected to the energy", "62:36", "network blah blah", "62:37", "then you can ripple a small change", "62:39", "ripples through the whole thing and", "62:40", "blows it apart it doesn't function", "62:41", "anymore so you know I don't need like", "62:43", "apocalypses to have the fabric of", "62:47", "technological civilization fall apart", "62:49", "like so if the if just the weather", "62:50", "patterns change enough that agriculture", "62:53", "becomes really hard you know we're used", "62:55", "to the rains falling pretty much the", "62:57", "same way they do yearly and everything", "62:59", "that you know like we talked about you", "63:02", "look at what the you know like refugees", "63:03", "how much you know we're the trouble you", "63:06", "know having a huge influx of refugees", "63:07", "can cause climate change is gonna have", "63:09", "people moving all over the planet", "63:10", "because now they can't grow food", "63:12", "anywhere so it's like I don't you know", "63:13", "like I said you don't need I do worry", "63:15", "like ocean rise is gonna be huge most", "63:17", "people live in coastal cities most of", "63:19", "the wealth in the world is in coastal", "63:20", "cities um but you don't really need too", "63:23", "much - like really shift the weather", "63:24", "patterns and then the thing you're used", "63:26", "to falls apart", "63:27", "now when you factor in human beings and", "63:32", "our evolution from primitive hominids to", "63:35", "what we are today and you sort of", "63:38", "extrapolate and keep going and think", "63:39", "about what we're going to be in the", "63:41", "future and then think about what these", "63:43", "creatures might be that live a hundred", "63:47", "million light years away or whatever the", "63:48", "fuck it is yeah what I mean we've got", "63:52", "I've got to think that whatever is", "63:55", "holding us back", "63:56", "our primitive instincts these human", "63:59", "reward systems that were engaged when we", "64:02", "were running away from wild animals and", "64:04", "fighting off tribes of invaders that", "64:06", "slowly but surely those are going to", "64:09", "either evaporate or evolve and we're", "64:12", "going to get to a point where we can be", "64:13", "more rational yeah about complex issues", "64:16", "if we do do that but what is the", "64:19", "motivation for expanding the human race", "64:23", "isn't sustaining the human race in a", "64:26", "healthy way", "64:26", "on this planet", "64:28", "better option than traveling to Mars or", "64:31", "traveling to the other solar systems", "64:33", "like wouldn't we be better served trying", "64:36", "to achieve some sort of a balance here", "64:39", "on this planet I think the I think one", "64:43", "serves the other like we you know you", "64:46", "look at the human migration patterns", "64:47", "from when we started writing you know we", "64:49", "started off as a you know a bunch of", "64:50", "people in average Africa maybe a few", "64:51", "thousand right and then you see this you", "64:53", "know migration like her you know saw a", "64:55", "bunch of us like a few hundred crossed", "64:57", "the Red Sea which was pretty low at the", "64:59", "time and then it's like they just worked", "65:01", "their way around the coasts you know two", "65:03", "boats over to Australia and went all the", "65:05", "way back around through like we're", "65:07", "explorers man like really I think", "65:09", "something fundamental for us", "65:11", "psychologically to have these frontiers", "65:15", "exactly that's one question those will", "65:17", "we've evolved past that well I don't", "65:19", "think that's a bad thing I yeah yeah I", "65:21", "don't think this bad thing because again", "65:23", "you know it's goes back to the biosphere", "65:24", "this is kind of like I think there's", "65:25", "something deep in life that wants more", "65:27", "life right so if we call it Oh settle", "65:30", "Mars right then it's not going to be", "65:32", "really us settling Mars it's gonna be", "65:34", "the Earth's biosphere right I mean", "65:35", "really right we're the agent of the", "65:38", "biosphere right and you know the", "65:39", "biosphere started off as like you know", "65:41", "single-celled creatures in little tiny", "65:43", "parts of the planet and then you know", "65:45", "conquered the oceans and then eventually", "65:47", "when they were cut in the beginning they", "65:48", "weren't continents there was a water", "65:50", "world when we started off and so when", "65:52", "you know there was enough continents you", "65:54", "know then they took over the life took", "65:55", "over the land I think it's just kind of", "65:57", "life maybe kind of like a cosmic force", "65:59", "if I can get all boogly on you you know", "66:00", "so if we do go to Mars it will", "66:02", "essentially be ultimate panspermia yes", "66:04", "exactly right yeah in that way bright", "66:06", "panspermia which is we're always a weird", "66:08", "word panspermia well just because people", "66:10", "are they feel weird about sperms", "66:13", "whenever I give an academic talk I'm", "66:15", "like parents Maria I know it's a strange", "66:17", "when you say sperm in front of people", "66:19", "they're like you piece of shit yeah term", "66:22", "a nice no matter", "66:23", "that's like saying niggardly yeah right", "66:25", "so it's very very difficult word to say", "66:27", "yeah I know it has nothing to do with", "66:29", "the N word yeah so um you know I think I", "66:32", "think it's part of life I think life", "66:34", "wants more life and this is the question", "66:35", "you're raising about look what do we", "66:36", "look like in a million years what", "66:37", "happens to a species that become and you", "66:40", "know now we're in the realm of science", "66:41", "fiction", "66:42", "that's all cool um you know like what", "66:45", "might we become like the gods and some", "66:48", "so you think that this is my theory and", "66:51", "I've thrown this out so many times", "66:52", "people are sick of it but I think that", "66:53", "what we're looking at when we see these", "66:55", "archetypal aliens with the big heads and", "66:58", "the big eyes and the tiny bodies and no", "67:00", "genitals I think we think this is what", "67:02", "we're eventually going to be yeah oh man", "67:07", "I'll see you in your pants firming this", "67:19", "is the problem this is why we need", "67:21", "diversity I just think that if weak so", "67:26", "those are archetypes kind of built into", "67:27", "us in some sense that we're moving Pat", "67:29", "like what did we used to be well we used", "67:31", "to be monkeys right and what are we", "67:33", "going to be what we're going to be that", "67:35", "thing yeah that thing that can levitate", "67:37", "things with its mom and the thing that", "67:38", "communicates telepathically that thing", "67:41", "that has this incredible ability to map", "67:45", "out the cosmos and create wormholes and", "67:47", "the super advanced intellect and point", "67:51", "where we can't even comprehend so like", "67:54", "if you think about how what you know we", "67:57", "evolved from at one point time we split", "68:01", "from mollusks like what 600 it's got to", "68:07", "be on it got to be past the Cambrian", "68:08", "explosion but you know it's like yeah", "68:09", "300 400 I don't know yeah but so a while", "68:12", "ago how how much does a squid understand", "68:15", "about cellphone networks and whether or", "68:17", "not it's Sprint's it's really good", "68:22", "Deauville will extrapolate that to what", "68:25", "this alien creature is going to be in", "68:28", "terms of its understanding of time and", "68:30", "space and matter", "68:31", "versus hours yeah we are this crew thing", "68:34", "that's weirded out by the word sperm", "68:36", "whereas it is telepathically", "68:38", "communicating with a universal language", "68:40", "and it has this unbelievable ability to", "68:43", "manipulate matter and they've achieved", "68:45", "homeostasis with their environment I no", "68:47", "longer have this well that's one of the", "68:49", "things about you know there's the Fermi", "68:50", "paradox right yeah like why haven't we", "68:52", "seen so I already said", "68:54", "we haven't looked enough to say that the", "68:55", "we haven't seen evidence of life right", "68:57", "it's like opening your door and goes", "68:59", "well where are all the Buffalo yeah but", "69:06", "you know there is a kind of a problem", "69:07", "with because we just doing a paper on", "69:09", "this now you know part of the Fermi", "69:10", "paradox", "69:11", "let's get I don't want to go too far on", "69:13", "this we can go back please do later um I", "69:15", "liked it so yeah it hard ox is fast but", "69:17", "it is right so that so the the the idea", "69:19", "that we had two people okay so the Fermi", "69:21", "paradox is the idea that like you know", "69:23", "what if there is if the paradox part is", "69:26", "like if you're telling me that", "69:27", "intelligence is common it evolves", "69:29", "everywhere then why don't I see it", "69:31", "already right so the the if you're", "69:33", "asking about like why don't we see", "69:35", "signals from that I've already answered", "69:36", "that right because we just we haven't", "69:38", "looked yet so that's nice to know yeah", "69:39", "but hid part of his question and this", "69:41", "was done by a guy in heart I mean oh so", "69:43", "Fermi was just this happened over a", "69:44", "conversation in for lunch", "69:45", "you know 1950 so uh he just posed the", "69:48", "you said where are they all but in 1975", "69:50", "guy named Hart wrote a paper where he", "69:51", "really mapped out the here's the main", "69:53", "problem even if you're traveling at a", "69:56", "tenth of the speed of light if you", "69:57", "manage to build like world ships that", "69:59", "can travel across the Stars you know and", "70:01", "you're traveling at 0.1% of the speed of", "70:03", "light in you know if you do that you hop", "70:06", "from one star together build another", "70:07", "ship hop to the next one in about", "70:09", "600,000 years you have covered the whole", "70:11", "galaxy right so 600,000 years sounds", "70:13", "like a long time but it's a tiny part of", "70:15", "the galaxies history galaxies ten", "70:17", "billion years old so in that case like", "70:19", "why you know then every if you're just", "70:22", "one species has to do that and they can", "70:24", "cover the galaxies so why aren't there", "70:26", "why don't we see the colony ships here", "70:27", "right that's that's a much harder", "70:30", "version of the Fermi paradox to get", "70:32", "around is it though because if we did", "70:35", "look we're already sending robots to", "70:37", "Mars right we're not going to Mars yet", "70:39", "but we're sending robots there what if", "70:41", "we decide that there's no real benefit", "70:42", "in sending biological entities into", "70:44", "space and that the the dangers of", "70:46", "radiation and asteroid impacts no this", "70:49", "is just too great yeah it's so far", "70:51", "better to send something I mean look at", "70:53", "what we're capable of doing now in terms", "70:55", "of projection of video we can take a", "70:58", "cell phone video and you could send it", "71:00", "to your friend in New Zealand and they", "71:02", "can get it almost instantly", "71:05", "Skype call right we can get some sort of", "71:08", "3d virtual reality imaging of these", "71:12", "planets like hey man do you want to see", "71:13", "what it's like on Pandora here put these", "71:15", "goggles on yeah and you old go wherever", "71:18", "you want that robot to go and you'll be", "71:20", "there yeah right and maybe it'll get to", "71:22", "the point where you can actually smell", "71:23", "it and touch it and feel it and but not", "71:26", "be compromised by its environment terms", "71:28", "of your biology well that's actually a", "71:29", "huge point so that's one of the things", "71:30", "we're looking at in this paper is the", "71:32", "idea that you know good planets may be", "71:33", "hard to find you know there's this great", "71:35", "uh novel by Kim Stanley Robinson who's", "71:38", "like dis life for me one of the great", "71:39", "science fiction writers and it's called", "71:40", "Aurora and they you know they it's the", "71:41", "usual world ship they go so they build", "71:43", "the colony ship it takes you know three", "71:45", "generations to cross space and they get", "71:47", "to the planet and the planet sucks it", "71:49", "looked like it was gonna be good you", "71:50", "know but there's like prions tiny or", "71:52", "super small biological shit that just", "71:55", "makes you can't live there and then", "71:56", "you're going back right so it's like it", "71:57", "may be exactly like you're saying that", "72:00", "you know we think like oh you just land", "72:01", "on a planet you terraform it and you", "72:03", "know you just turn it into habitable", "72:04", "when it's like that may not work and", "72:05", "maybe it does but that's a science", "72:07", "fiction idea so uh right it's entirely", "72:10", "possible I mean there's a lot of", "72:11", "possible solutions this which is just", "72:13", "that uh you know one of which is space", "72:15", "travels really hard and really", "72:16", "interstellar not interplanetary but", "72:19", "interstellar travel is really hard and", "72:20", "really expensive I was just reading a", "72:22", "paper on this with a guy estimated that", "72:23", "in order to get like say you wanted to", "72:25", "have a thousand people on a world ship", "72:27", "to get to another star that would take", "72:29", "the economy that come you need like a", "72:30", "thud I think was like a hundred thousand", "72:33", "earth economies to build that you know I", "72:35", "mean if Bezos are you listening time", "72:38", "we're ready you might have like you know", "72:43", "you unless you were he's you know what", "72:45", "the conclusion he came to unless you", "72:46", "were a multi-planet species if you were", "72:48", "like if you had conquered the entire or", "72:51", "settled the entire solar system maybe", "72:53", "you'd have an economy that big so one", "72:55", "one possible solution is good planets", "72:56", "are hard to find and and you know it's", "73:00", "just too expensive it really costs a lot", "73:02", "and so yeah it's not really worth you", "73:04", "know the effort you you know you send", "73:06", "out some probes once in a while but you", "73:07", "know it's not well there's also finding", "73:10", "an environment that's not just habitable", "73:12", "but stable I mean our environment is", "73:14", "habitable but look what's going on in", "73:16", "Hawaii right now there", "73:17", "a 400 year old Lake that evaporated in a", "73:20", "matter of hours right it's the biggest", "73:23", "lake on the big yeah it's gone right", "73:25", "which is such a tragedy so but it's not", "73:27", "it's not it's just magnificent right", "73:30", "you watch that lava roll into that Lake", "73:32", "and say that's a wrap kids more lake you", "73:34", "fucks yeah and it really shows you the", "73:36", "power of a planet - right yeah I know", "73:37", "that sources at work what makes", "73:39", "continents may have made the island in", "73:42", "the first place I can't be upset at it", "73:44", "billowing off it is what made the island", "73:46", "right it's continuing to make the island", "73:48", "we're right right exactly you're right", "73:50", "about your house but now you got more", "73:51", "real estate so shuttle it's making the", "73:53", "island bigger and it's always done that", "73:55", "yeah it's been doing that for millions", "73:56", "of years it's a fascinating place you", "73:58", "know if you've been I've been and I've", "74:00", "seen that I went to the park did you do", "74:02", "the helicopter thing now oh man you got", "74:04", "to do the helicopter thing that's crazy", "74:06", "because you fly over the volcanoes we", "74:08", "can't now because it's too crazy but I", "74:10", "did a few years back and you could watch", "74:12", "the lava go into the ocean yeah and you", "74:15", "see these lava vents pour this red-hot", "74:18", "fucking yeah it's like it's glowing yeah", "74:22", "it's going into the day I saw that we", "74:24", "went to the park to see it you know you", "74:27", "know then when you went to when you go", "74:28", "to that volcano park there's just like", "74:29", "Vince where Steve's coming out like New", "74:31", "York City with the you know the manholes", "74:33", "like that's like that's just from this", "74:36", "heat coming down at the bottom of the", "74:37", "planet are you scared about Yellowstone", "74:40", "I like the what was that movie at 2012", "74:43", "now yeah like where's that cuz that's", "74:45", "like such a that's like that's what made", "74:47", "the Adirondacks right yeah what was the", "74:49", "2012 movie I know I saw that with Cooney", "74:52", "After Tomorrow day before tomorrow no no", "74:54", "it was it was like climate change it was", "74:56", "John Cusack it's actually a pretty good", "74:58", "yeah destroy the plant those guys who", "75:00", "made that hold on stop right there does", "75:02", "not a pretty good movie that was so", "75:04", "stupid", "75:08", "mister by inches with the cars they", "75:12", "never got a flat they always got away", "75:13", "from the world caving in who totally", "75:16", "believable man oh yeah no I thought it", "75:21", "well Yellowstone is a caldera it's a", "75:23", "supervolcano and they're experiencing", "75:24", "thousands of earthquakes a year yeah and", "75:27", "that eventually yeah every six to eight", "75:30", "hundred thousand years it's a continent", "75:31", "the last time it blew was 600,000 years", "75:33", "ago yeah so why are you scared uh I", "75:35", "don't I just don't think about it every", "75:38", "day man I'll smoke a joint I think about", "75:40", "once a month I think about yellow I", "75:44", "should okay I'm gonna add that to my", "75:45", "list of things I'm freaking out about I", "75:46", "have friends in Australia and that's", "75:48", "where I'm going", "75:48", "yeah because there's light over just", "75:50", "start driving on the left-hand side it's", "75:53", "not me the only thing you can go do I", "75:54", "worry more about Seattle I lived in", "75:56", "Seattle for a while you know and they", "75:57", "said the super-earth going from there", "75:58", "that's gonna turn the whole thing into", "75:59", "jello right you get north quakes so bad", "76:01", "that the ground just literally becomes", "76:02", "porous is it really that scary there", "76:05", "yeah yeah they're predicting because you", "76:06", "know Seattle's got like I mean I don't", "76:08", "know that much about this some way out", "76:08", "of my I'm in the danger zone", "76:10", "um the plates are super deep you know so", "76:14", "you don't get as many tremors but but", "76:16", "you know when it releases it's gonna you", "76:18", "know it's just be a super powerful", "76:20", "earthquake and you know the it'll it'll", "76:22", "be so powerful yeah that they said that", "76:23", "like there's not gonna be a lot even", "76:25", "even with the earthquake proofing", "76:27", "there's not gonna be a lot of left", "76:28", "standing geez so yeah Seattle you must", "76:32", "be I mean because you're here right you", "76:33", "feel tremors they must they happen all", "76:35", "the time right I've only been at any", "76:36", "time so not all the time I've felt them", "76:38", "before the the biggest ones I ever felt", "76:40", "was when I first moved here I first", "76:42", "moved here in 94 and it was right after", "76:43", "the Northridge earthquake and I was in", "76:45", "my house and I felt I guess it was like", "76:48", "a 5.5 where the whole thing just it was", "76:53", "weird like it gave me the impression", "76:55", "that the house that I was living in or", "76:57", "the apartment that I was in was made out", "76:59", "of the same stuff like a box that a", "77:02", "refrigerator would come in yeah you can", "77:04", "move it around inside the whole thing", "77:07", "was just moving like easily left and", "77:09", "right up holy shit that was my only had", "77:12", "a few times I have you know felt like", "77:13", "it's like it's you know at first I", "77:15", "thought it was a truck I thought a truck", "77:16", "was rolling but yeah you know and", "77:18", "somebody that wasn't and the one that I", "77:20", "experienced was nothing I mean it's a", "77:23", "baby one the ones that they're getting", "77:24", "you know right now somewhere in the", "77:27", "world I mean there's there's always", "77:29", "something that's like a five or six yeah", "77:31", "so this goes back to your point about", "77:33", "the you know a lot of planets right", "77:34", "we'll be like way more plate tectonic", "77:37", "reactive volatile yeah then our so you", "77:40", "know I mean a lot I mean I think good", "77:41", "planets are gonna be like really hard to", "77:43", "find yeah", "77:44", "so you know it may be that maybe the", "77:46", "solution the other solution is you know", "77:48", "I mean the way you guys found out about", "77:50", "which I did that article about the", "77:51", "previous civilization you know like how", "77:54", "do you know whether not there was a", "77:55", "previous civil and we know one solution", "77:59", "could be that look they were here you", "78:01", "know that somebody did arrive and spend", "78:03", "some time on earth but if it was like", "78:04", "half a billion years ago and they only", "78:06", "last the right every civilization has a", "78:07", "finite lifetime they only lasted for", "78:09", "even up a few hundred thousand years", "78:11", "they wouldn't leave there'd be no record", "78:13", "left would be nothing left there'd be", "78:14", "nothing like you think that's possible", "78:16", "that something's ever visited here and", "78:17", "because that is the big question and", "78:19", "that's the the thing that gets that UFO", "78:21", "dorks s'more jazzed up than anything is", "78:24", "the possibility that we've been visited", "78:25", "yeah not now I'm definitely not you UFOs", "78:28", "they still have two arguments against", "78:29", "UFOs one is as a friend of mine Jason", "78:33", "Wright says it's like look as", "78:34", "astronomers made we you know we're", "78:36", "finding all those asteroids we're", "78:37", "finding a little chunks of rock moving", "78:39", "yeah nobody looks at the sky harder than", "78:41", "we do right and you know if anything", "78:43", "unless you want to go to the conspiracy", "78:45", "theories we would have found something", "78:47", "my other argument is like what's with", "78:48", "the headlights you know I mean people", "78:50", "are is like ah man I saw lights in the", "78:51", "sky and then they moved around and then", "78:52", "they disappeared you know but they don't", "78:53", "really want to be seen I'm like well why", "78:55", "do they have headlights on like what", "78:56", "just turn off the frickin lights it just", "78:58", "why would they have lights in the first", "78:59", "place I don't have lights like what you", "79:00", "can you know you came from another", "79:01", "civilization and you can get around", "79:03", "without your high beams the ideas what", "79:05", "the fuck are you seeing with those", "79:06", "lights Ron you're not seeing shit yeah", "79:09", "that was the last time you saw I mean", "79:10", "planes have lights so other planes don't", "79:12", "run into him they don't have a light so", "79:14", "they could see where they're going yeah", "79:15", "so what so why they have right exactly", "79:17", "the planes have lights so other people", "79:18", "can see them so fair answer but they're", "79:20", "mysterious they don't want to be found", "79:21", "in turn off the frickin light so well", "79:22", "they yeah they wouldn't have any lights", "79:24", "yeah they always have lights yeah so", "79:27", "like this guy they move back and forth", "79:29", "and so it's always a problem with human", "79:31", "memory memories right horrible yeah and", "79:34", "memory of events that are stunning or", "79:36", "shocking or unnerving or you think you", "79:38", "saw something right they've done all", "79:40", "that research even in trials right where", "79:41", "people do you know see things going so I", "79:43", "just UFOs you know I'm just kind of like", "79:45", "but do you think it's possible that", "79:47", "there could be life on other planets and", "79:49", "it's possible there could be intelligent", "79:51", "life on other planets and we send probes", "79:52", "to Mars", "79:53", "well I wouldn't in that I think that if", "79:55", "they do send something here they're", "79:57", "going to send something", "79:58", "now biological life inside of it yeah", "80:00", "you know it's a really interesting", "80:01", "question is like yeah we're talking like", "80:02", "what will we evolve into in you know a", "80:04", "million years you know it may be", "80:06", "possible that biology is a short period", "80:08", "of intelligence yes he's just build", "80:10", "machines and the machines become you", "80:13", "know", "80:13", "download yourself into him I mean that's", "80:15", "a real possibility that like you know", "80:17", "silicon makes a lot more sense than", "80:19", "wetware well the problem is we think of", "80:22", "artificial intelligence as artificial", "80:24", "right it's definitely real right yeah", "80:26", "exactly it's not it's not fake it's", "80:28", "right there right you know it's like", "80:30", "there's artificial milk you know I mean", "80:32", "but it's it's a liquid it's an actual", "80:35", "liquid yeah there's not an artificial", "80:37", "life it's just silicon created life", "80:40", "that's again the idea the biosphere this", "80:42", "may be the with the biosphere solution", "80:43", "to spreading itself or you know to", "80:45", "getting it may be that like yes so look", "80:47", "in that that's the kind of a normal", "80:49", "thing I mean I'm", "80:50", "I am super skeptical about like the", "80:53", "whole transhuman thing that we're gonna", "80:55", "download ourselves and do intelligent", "80:56", "you don't think are you ever gone in one", "80:57", "of those conventions", "80:59", "there's some pretty serious dark at", "81:01", "night", "81:01", "well there's geniuses in those dorks -", "81:04", "it's really interesting it's like", "81:05", "they're fully wholly committed to this", "81:08", "prospect of downloading them selves you", "81:09", "talk to Kurt's well before no but I've", "81:11", "read his stuff I had a chance to", "81:13", "interview him a few years back for", "81:14", "Cybersmart he's like beyond smart but", "81:17", "goddamn is he committed to it and then", "81:19", "when you get to it you realized that", "81:21", "what he actually wants to do is recreate", "81:24", "his father", "81:25", "yeah he's he his father died when he was", "81:28", "young", "81:29", "and he wants to be able to through", "81:31", "memories and photographs and what he", "81:34", "knows about his father literally", "81:35", "recreate his father and because be able", "81:39", "to have a conversation with him yeah he", "81:40", "was talking about this right right but", "81:42", "what he's doing is he's going way way", "81:45", "into the future into the possibilities", "81:48", "of he's not seeing like well five years", "81:50", "from now we're going to be able to send", "81:52", "you know gigabyte pictures through the", "81:54", "mail no he's saying let's think of if", "81:57", "you keep going exponentially and then", "81:59", "electronics and technology and", "82:01", "innovation keeps continually", "82:02", "accelerating we could potentially get to", "82:05", "the point where it's the impossible well", "82:08", "you'd be able to recreate human beings", "82:11", "Bay", "82:11", "turn your knowledge of them and in the", "82:13", "end they'll be able to come up with some", "82:15", "sort of a program will he'll be able to", "82:16", "have a conversation with his father yeah", "82:18", "see I think that misunder I mean I think", "82:19", "it's it's true about like the", "82:21", "possibility of a singularity and", "82:22", "technological development but you know", "82:25", "it's not gonna be his father that's the", "82:26", "sad thing you know I think we seriously", "82:29", "I've done some work on this as an", "82:30", "interest in mind about mind his mind you", "82:32", "know what's the relationship in mind and", "82:34", "matter and I think we have like a", "82:36", "serious misunderstand we don't", "82:37", "understand consciousness very well at", "82:40", "all so the idea that like oh yeah it", "82:42", "she's gonna be trivial to download your", "82:43", "you know your consciousness into a", "82:45", "computer I think it's pretty you know", "82:46", "there's like a shitload of assumptions", "82:48", "in there about like what mind is in the", "82:51", "relationship between like your neurons", "82:52", "and you know awareness yes so that's why", "82:56", "I think those guys it's a little bit of", "82:57", "a religion you know what I mean you know", "83:00", "so it's like well 2045 is the new", "83:03", "benchmark for whatever reason that's the", "83:05", "new number will be back it's gonna be", "83:07", "like every other you know which every", "83:09", "other rapture we thought was 2045 we", "83:11", "really been 2065 you know we went to", "83:13", "this 2045 conference me and my friend", "83:15", "Ari and Duncan and we got to talk to", "83:17", "some of these guys and is really", "83:18", "fascinating and one of them had created", "83:21", "some robot that was supposed to be him", "83:24", "but it didn't work well so they never", "83:26", "revealed it at the conference it had so", "83:28", "many bugs in it", "83:28", "yeah it's intriguing it's like I want", "83:31", "them to keep going because I mean when", "83:33", "when we get gonna get to ex machina when", "83:36", "are we gonna get to talk about good", "83:37", "movies or did you like that one of my", "83:39", "favorite movies ever so smart so like", "83:41", "just like simple a beating over the head", "83:43", "with it", "83:43", "no kind of shit moments in that movie", "83:46", "yeah no no whoa the entire I think", "83:48", "that's one of my all-time top 20 movies", "83:51", "but she stabs him just emotionless just", "83:53", "let him put the blade in it was amazing", "83:55", "amazing did you like annihilation yes I", "84:02", "didn't like it as much but I liked it it", "84:04", "was very weird and the ending seemed", "84:06", "like some producers put their jizz in", "84:08", "the soup what's happening here who made", "84:12", "this part yeah but I", "84:14", "yeah yeah so I think like you know I", "84:16", "mean and the danger with anything when", "84:18", "it comes to AI and so well here's an", "84:20", "interesting thing about AI like we are", "84:22", "making amazing strides with a oh yeah no", "84:25", "now artificial intelligence is different", "84:26", "from artificial consciousness you know", "84:28", "it means like but um but the AI that you", "84:31", "know what we're getting out of it is", "84:32", "nothing like us right so the you know", "84:34", "back in the day where people were like", "84:36", "oh we're gonna like model the human", "84:37", "brain and that's how we'll do it well", "84:39", "like make programs that are what and", "84:40", "what they've learned is like that", "84:42", "doesn't really work that well so now", "84:43", "this is the whole big data thing like", "84:45", "you know network theory and big data and", "84:46", "deep learning we're like you know", "84:48", "they're using statistical you know the", "84:50", "power of having huge amounts of", "84:52", "computing and statistical reasoning so", "84:55", "that like you know yeah the computer", "84:56", "like you know it'll find the picture of", "84:58", "the cat but you have no idea why it", "85:00", "found that it didn't reason like oh yeah", "85:02", "that sort of looks like cat and I like", "85:03", "cats you know it's just like oh these", "85:05", "kinds of lines go with that kind of", "85:06", "thing it has no idea what it's doing but", "85:08", "it'll act intelligently and so that's", "85:10", "you know I mean that's kind of freaky", "85:13", "deaky in a lot of ways too I think", "85:15", "people are I think it's it's smart to", "85:17", "think about the dangers of AI not", "85:19", "necessarily what additional Jers to us", "85:22", "yeah", "85:23", "not necessarily the dangers just the", "85:25", "dangers to this thing that we are this", "85:27", "weird monkey thing yeah that wants to", "85:29", "keep being a monkey thing yeah well you", "85:31", "mean in the sense of like right that", "85:33", "it's going to replace us yes yeah yeah I", "85:35", "think it's inevitable I mean do you", "85:37", "don't you think that if you go back and", "85:39", "interview the single-celled organism", "85:40", "before it branched off into multi cell", "85:43", "multi cell bullshit I want to stay a", "85:47", "single cell at the bottom of the cars", "85:53", "fuck that I don't want a car man I like", "85:55", "staying down here yeah like there's a", "85:57", "real thought to that that we are the", "86:00", "wetware that is the problem yeah no no", "86:02", "listen I think it's fully conceivable", "86:05", "like I'm not gonna get or never happen", "86:07", "but as a guy I know as a philosopher", "86:09", "says you know there's a certain way in", "86:10", "which everything we do with AI right now", "86:12", "it's not like you know Watson is playing", "86:15", "chess it's like we're using Watson to", "86:17", "play chess it's our tool you know and I", "86:20", "think the purpose the fear is the tool", "86:21", "gets out of hand", "86:22", "not that it like develops a thing we're", "86:24", "like I hate humans you know dad I hate", "86:26", "you but more that's like you know these", "86:28", "things which are not actually thinking", "86:30", "they act intelligent but they're not", "86:31", "thinking can have a huge like it'll have", "86:34", "a really negative impact it will you", "86:36", "know what", "86:36", "there's that example like if you design", "86:37", "something that is an AI system to make", "86:39", "paper clips", "86:40", "it ends up consuming the entire planet", "86:42", "making paper clips that's what you told", "86:43", "it to do right you never told it to make", "86:45", "a sustainable amount of it right exactly", "86:47", "so I'm more worried about that than I am", "86:49", "of like Skynet you know coming over and", "86:51", "like you know deciding that's gonna you", "86:53", "know drop all the bombs on us cuz we", "86:54", "need to get rid of it well there's no", "86:56", "biological imperative for silicon based", "86:59", "artificial intelligence to procreate to", "87:02", "keep going and move forward like why", "87:03", "would they do that we're going to do it", "87:05", "because we came from biology and biology", "87:08", "needs to stay alive and everybody wants", "87:12", "bigger faster stronger you want to keep", "87:14", "moving and it's because there's a real", "87:16", "possibility that you might get consumed", "87:18", "by some other life-form yeah so you have", "87:20", "to protect yourself and you have to look", "87:22", "out for other people who might want to", "87:24", "breed with the viable female that you've", "87:26", "copulated with right there's a lot of", "87:29", "shit just going on built in", "87:30", "evolutionarily to have right that we", "87:32", "assume that somehow or another these", "87:34", "artificial creations will have as well", "87:36",

makes", "103:05", "such a big difference because now you're", "103:07", "just like it started in front of a blank", "103:09", "screen they also you could also replace", "103:11", "all of the characters with a larger", "103:14", "character like like say if you were", "103:16", "playing as like this girl so I give this", "103:18", "one it's doing like it's showing the mod", "103:20", "in between I've heard here you son of a", "103:28", "bitch no no Jamie", "103:30", "pull pull up quake no textures pull up", "103:34", "quake no textures and then you can watch", "103:37", "what it looks like that is not no", "103:39", "textures that that's different you can", "103:41", "see the difference in the colors and", "103:42", "things are moving it's when they turn", "103:44", "off all the textures you you get to see", "103:47", "these flat well that's what it looks", "103:49", "like right see ya", "103:51", "now that is a way different experience", "103:53", "yeah to see right you can't shadow I", "103:56", "still exist but all the textures are", "103:59", "gone and if you show a video that see if", "104:01", "you could find a video that Jamie when", "104:03", "in the videos you see things moving", "104:05", "around with no textures and you realize", "104:07", "what an advantage it would be if you're", "104:08", "playing someone it was you're constantly", "104:11",

this quake live ok this is again I", "104:21", "still got to ask what is quake I mean", "104:23", "well I've heard of it but I've never", "104:24", "played it like it's the ultimate", "104:25",

"104:34", "know there's a Swee did doom didn't they", "104:35", "they came out with another didn't they", "104:36", "come up with yes they did and there's", "104:39", "another one that's coming out soon", "104:41", "but what quake one was was these cool", "104:44", "maps and you would run around and shoot", "104:47", "each other and you'd have these death", "104:48", "matches so one on one death matches and", "104:50", "shoot rockets at each other like it and", "104:52", "it's you're seeing it through your", "104:55", "perspective like so if you have a rocket", "104:56", "launcher you see the rocket launcher in", "104:58", "front of you or there so that whole idea", "105:00", "what is this one call this quake", "105:02", "champions this is the newest version I", "105:04", "mean the graphics aren't fucking", "105:05", "incredible in these things now they", "105:07", "they're so excited we're gonna have", "105:09", "we're setting up a lamb here a local", "105:12", "area network here what we're gonna", "105:14", "stream live and play each other", "105:16", "excellent and waste massive mouse I'm", "105:20", "sure man sometimes I'm sort of like oh", "105:22", "three hours just went by yeah he's gonna", "105:24", "go to sleep a little bit over well", "105:26", "whatever dude it will suck up your time", "105:28", "it'll suck up but you know I can't play", "105:29", "I'm just I'm not good enough to play", "105:31", "those kinds of things like it's just", "105:32", "like spawned I spawned I how dare you", "105:37", "say that there you put the limitations", "105:42", "you just need to learn left with WASD", "105:46", "learn how to move your fingers around", "105:49", "consoles are bullshit I know some people", "105:52", "say listen", "105:53", "ya can't get any real accuracy with a", "105:54", "console that's your problem how do you", "105:56", "do I mean the console now listen to you", "106:00", "how do you learn physics how do you like", "106:06", "you can do it man you cats like rocky or", "106:08", "something that's right a grotty kid or", "106:10", "whatever that movie where someone", "106:14", "teaches someone how to play a video yeah", "106:16", "he's a nerd in the beginning and he's", "106:18", "like a loser but you know it comes back", "106:19", "and it gets the girl well one of the", "106:21", "reasons why I wanted to talk to you", "106:22", "about this in particular is because I am", "106:25", "more and more convinced that it's our", "106:27", "future may lie in some artificially", "106:30", "created world and that people are more", "106:33", "interested and more attracted everyday", "106:36", "to virtual reality augmented reality", "106:38", "virtual reality and what can Cheney what", "106:41", "was that game the one game where there", "106:44", "was you the created worlds I was gonna", "106:47", "pull that up earlier and ask it's called", "106:48", "no man's sky oh I played that I bet", "106:50", "played that I bought because of course", "106:51", "any space game I'm like right it's", "106:53", "boring though it is because you know", "106:55", "they have 80 trillion worlds but all", "106:57", "this they're basically they don't look", "106:58", "that different you know so it's like", "106:59", "oatmeal 80 million bottles and over", "107:02", "there you go there and people are", "107:04", "shooting each other and stealing money", "107:06", "no no what is better for that Cup yeah", "107:08", "right I mean it's you know it looked", "107:09", "like it was people but what's better is", "107:11", "elite dangerous so after this I was so", "107:13", "disappointed in this I went back and I", "107:16", "found a leap dangerous which is just", "107:18", "disappointing this because there was no", "107:19", "action yeah there was no you just ran", "107:21", "around and your mind stuff it was sort", "107:23", "of like it just wasn't exciting there", "107:25", "was nothing exciting there was no you", "107:27", "know there was no so I like I said I", "107:28", "don't usually play sort of these massive", "107:30", "multiplayer games so this is elite", "107:31", "dangerous is elite dangerous and it is", "107:33", "man the trading or you know you can", "107:35", "decide oh I want to be I want to be a", "107:36", "bounty hunter you know and it was so", "107:40", "rich I just I spent there was like a", "107:42", "good six months of my life that I was", "107:43", "like you know working my way getting", "107:44", "better ships I became good see who", "107:46", "doesn't want to be a bounty hunter right", "107:47", "you know I'm saying like that's what", "107:49", "everybody's and this just this game had", "107:50", "you know and there's like I don't know a", "107:52", "few hundred thousand people in there", "107:53", "you're creating the universe it's", "107:55", "evolving they add storylines so you know", "107:58", "well we are setting up an HTC vive here", "108:01", "and we're we when he was HTC EVO how", "108:04", "dare you I know man it's like virtual", "108:14", "reality it's and it's consumer virtual", "108:17", "reality when my friend never done though", "108:19", "oh boy I've been waiting I've been sort", "108:22", "of well we tried to get one Jamie went", "108:25", "out yesterday and look they're all sold", "108:27", "out so we had to order one and so we're", "108:29", "ordering one we're gonna have it set up", "108:30", "in here", "108:31", "and the the games I played the games of", "108:35", "two years ago and I'm sure they're way", "108:37", "more advanced than they are now yeah", "108:38", "there's a crazy archery game where the", "108:41", "you're on the top of a castle and these", "108:42", "little monsters that look like they", "108:44", "could be in South Park they're not like", "108:46", "detailed right right kind of", "108:48", "cool-looking monsters and you shoot out", "108:49", "on with bows and arrows they're trying", "108:50", "to invade the castle but man that's", "108:52", "addictive because you really look down", "108:54", "you see them all around you you have", "108:56", "like a real sorry my always been my", "108:59", "question about like you know I sit on my", "109:01", "chair and I play my video game so like", "109:02", "are you yes this is it see this guy has", "109:05", "a thing in his hands and he's moving", "109:07", "around this is like a Star Wars one", "109:09", "right and there's a bunch of different", "109:11", "ones that I've so you always got to be", "109:12", "standing right in some sense yes if you", "109:15", "want to just like sit down with the", "109:16", "board and like you can but there's also", "109:18", "a boxing one that you get a real workout", "109:20", "in Wow", "109:20", "so it's a game and I played it over", "109:23", "Duncan's house so I think there's a", "109:24", "video of it but it's weird because you", "109:26", "punch wrong so like the like if I'm", "109:30", "holding my hands like this which is I'm", "109:32", "holding my hands vertically where my", "109:34", "thumb's are up yeah right the boxing", "109:36", "gloves would be horizontal like they", "109:39", "would be if you were punching someone", "109:41", "yeah so so it doesn't do the turn no", "109:43", "it's weird so as you move your hands", "109:45", "forward like this which you really", "109:47", "wouldn't punch like that the punches", "109:49", "come out so they've got to iron that as", "109:51", "you guys say that'll be something", "109:53", "they'll work out it yeah and make the", "109:54", "the controller rotate the way a fist", "109:57", "would but as you're doing it you throw", "109:59", "real punches and someone's throwing", "110:00", "punches at you and when they throw", "110:01", "punches you and they hit you you see a", "110:03", "white flash in front of you that's good", "110:05", "makes you nervous just like real", "110:07", "sparring does yeah yeah well you know", "110:09", "and so like this question of like what", "110:10", "are we gonna do with virtual reality cuz", "110:12", "like I said um I already you know I see", "110:14", "huge potential for like education in", "110:17", "gaming and that's why we built our games", "110:18", "yeah here's this is me over Duncan's", "110:21", "house just I want anybody to walk by you", "110:24", "know I gotta get a beer BAM I'm beating", "110:26", "this guy up moving around him see that's", "110:29", "the thing I always wonder what he got", "110:32", "that guy was fucking dunking up every", "110:35", "day it's like dude how did you beat I", "110:37", "was like move around don't stand right", "110:39", "in front dope well you got a-you got", "110:43", "footwork and movement but you you can", "110:45", "really get a workout with that I'm not", "110:47", "joking yeah you get exhausted yeah and", "110:49", "you know you you keep going and fight", "110:52", "tougher and tougher opponents right well", "110:54", "you know that's and that's the queen oh", "110:55", "so like talk about haptic suits like", "110:57", "eventually you know you're gonna wear", "110:58", "things I didn't see that I I've read the", "111:00", "book I didn't see the what was it the", "111:01", "movie that just Ready Set ready player", "111:04", "one I didn't see I didn't see it have", "111:06", "you read the book the book I'm like good", "111:07", "because the book is like full immersion", "111:08", "like the whole book is about like when", "111:10", "virtual reality is it and so everybody", "111:12", "has these suits that you and you're kind", "111:14", "of in this ball you played the game in a", "111:15", "brush you can run and you know but in", "111:18", "some sense yes we're just starting out", "111:19", "along these lines well they have these", "111:21", "places you can go that they have a", "111:22", "warehouse set up and you go inside of it", "111:24", "and I went through one with my kids and", "111:27", "it's a Star Wars one at Disneyland dude", "111:30", "it's fucking why you go across you're", "111:33", "walking across this platform like they", "111:35", "have all these different places where", "111:37", "you actually walk through yeah and as", "111:38", "you're walking through you look to the", "111:39", "left and to the right and there's fire", "111:41", "but you feel the heat from the fire it's", "111:43", "fucking crazy so I'm like heaters set up", "111:46", "so it blows up and stormtroopers start", "111:48", "shooting at you this is it right here", "111:49", "what is it called the void the void yeah", "111:52", "and you do this I'm telling you man this", "111:55", "is better than any of the rides at", "111:56", "Disneyland and it's just outside of", "111:58", "Disneyland in Downtown Disney so you", "112:00", "don't have to pay to get into different", "112:01", "get it but it costs I think it's $35 for", "112:06", "half an hour it's not cheap but it's not", "112:07", "too bad it's not too fat like it is it's", "112:10", "fucking awesome I mean it is awesome", "112:12", "yeah so the question is what happens", "112:14", "with the lattice right future right", "112:15", "because yeah virtual reality we're just", "112:17", "on the cusp ever right we're just", "112:18", "beginning to like start playing around", "112:20", "these technology because people wouldn't", "112:21", "stay in it for years they kind of sucked", "112:22", "it was sort of clunky well we're we're", "112:24", "we used to play pong right that's what I", "112:27", "started with are you about 55 yeah I'm", "112:30", "50 so I remember pong we were excited I", "112:33", "can't believe I'm controlling the TV", "112:34", "making the thing move on the TV or", "112:37", "asteroids yeah woo the", "112:39", "yeah I was a Star Wars game I don't", "112:40", "think was called asteroids but you flew", "112:42", "through the train just like wireframe", "112:44", "yeah but it was amazing times love that", "112:47", "I dropped a lot of quarters sure so go", "112:49", "from that to what you were showing us", "112:51", "here these crazy new space games yeah", "112:53", "and then imagine what these mean the", "112:56", "Star Wars thing today the void is really", "112:58", "cool but you know that it's not real", "113:01", "right but it's cool right but you know", "113:03", "it's not real well you're not gonna be", "113:05", "able to tell it's not real in 20 years", "113:06", "yeah right and how much time are people", "113:08", "spending by the way right when you do", "113:10", "this oh really there's so much pressure", "113:11", "you and you feel it when you get in shot", "113:13", "Wow you feel like Gd and you know it's", "113:17", "funny even with the controller on my", "113:19", "crappy ps4 whoo", "113:21", "you know what it vibrates when you you", "113:22", "know to sort of give you it's amazing", "113:25", "how much the brain sort of picks up on", "113:27", "these signals when you're using the HTC", "113:28", "vive and you draw an arrow back when it", "113:30", "gets to the knocking point you feel it", "113:33", "release there's a feeling in your hand", "113:36", "yeah seeing the arrow it's really cool", "113:38", "yeah so what happens when I write I can", "113:41", "be sort of like you know grandpa be like", "113:42", "that's terrible people should be going", "113:44", "out in nature which I think they should", "113:46", "be you know now you know I always I'm", "113:48", "always aware whenever I'm sort of like", "113:50", "oh shit this could be terrible I always", "113:51", "remember the hole you can see in like I", "113:53", "think at some point Socrates you know mm", "113:55", "five years 500 years ago he's like ooh", "113:57", "kids today rowboats you know it's all", "113:59", "right um so you know who knows what", "114:01", "we'll do with it and you know hopefully", "114:02", "you know maybe it'll help you know maybe", "114:04", "I don't know you know I may think there", "114:05", "is I don't want to be like oh that's", "114:07", "terrible but there clearly are it's", "114:09", "gonna be dangerous with just a different", "114:11", "game Jamie there's a new one oh boy", "114:14", "I'm gonna be far oh yeah just the hands", "114:19", "yeah and so you're you have two little", "114:22", "hand controllers and one of them would", "114:23", "be the arrow and the other one would be", "114:25", "the bow and you wear them and that's the", "114:27", "haptic part middle there's controllers", "114:28", "on them well you feel the arrow", "114:30", "vibrating against the riser of the bow", "114:33", "as you draw it back - it's really cool", "114:36", "well it's funny because you know we", "114:37", "talked about like you know for the game", "114:39", "that we built which was awesome you know", "114:41", "it's really a lot of fun to actually go", "114:43", "through the process of like how do you", "114:45", "you know how do you script it how do you", "114:46", "teach people you know like because I", "114:48", "don't think when we get in a good but", "114:49", "when you're a good game right you know", "114:50", "in the first couple hours of a game and", "114:52", "you're just learning the", "114:53", "six tops and you get excited this is a", "114:55", "cool world to be in um but I'd be", "114:57", "interested to think like sort of you", "114:59", "know I'm some point I did try VR for the", "115:01", "same thing because what can you once you", "115:02", "can't at have people be tactile they're", "115:04", "not to sort of in their head what else", "115:05", "can you do to sort of show them teach", "115:07", "them things you know like flashers or", "115:09", "you know I'm sure that's another thing", "115:11", "in Disneyland they have a thing called", "115:13", "soaring over the world that you sit in a", "115:15", "chair and you get raised up and there's", "115:18", "a giant like IMAX style screen and it", "115:20", "flies you over these environments it's", "115:22", "incredible so beautiful right and you", "115:24", "different smells are in the air and the", "115:26", "different places that you go to like", "115:28", "when you go over the elephant yeah the", "115:29", "elephants you smell grass and hay and I", "115:33", "think that it's just a matter of time", "115:34", "like as we were talking about before", "115:36", "where biological entities might not be", "115:39", "necessary for space travel you might be", "115:41", "able to send a robot put on a suit and", "115:43", "be able to experience these rights right", "115:45", "like in real time yeah well um so you", "115:48", "know you know the simulation argument", "115:50", "yeah that's a philosophy argue about you", "115:53", "know and so that's a really interesting", "115:54", "idea should we just run through it for", "115:55", "people who's shorter okay so I forgot", "115:57", "who was Nick Bostrom that maybe not a", "115:59", "Brandon Carter there's this this guy", "116:01", "philosopher came with this brilliant", "116:03", "argument for like why we're probably a", "116:05", "simulant we're probably somebody else's", "116:07", "simulation self-aware simulation and the", "116:09", "idea is like look if you get one you", "116:10", "know we've been talking about like", "116:11", "civilizations when they get a million", "116:13", "years ahead what can they do that", "116:15", "they're so powerful they can build", "116:17", "computers that can simulate reality like", "116:20", "fully simulate reality we're like you", "116:21", "know just like in the matrix you have", "116:22", "programs that are self-aware and so you", "116:24", "know once they get to that and they", "116:26", "start running simulations of the world", "116:28", "right it's cheaper to run it's cheap to", "116:30", "run simulations so they just run", "116:31", "trillions of them right so the idea is", "116:33", "that from that argument there's more", "116:36", "simulated realities than there is the", "116:38", "one real reality so odds are right you", "116:41", "know if there's a trillion simulated", "116:43", "realities in one real reality you're", "116:45", "probably in a simulated reality so are", "116:47", "we a you know everything right now you", "116:49", "and I think this is real you know but", "116:51", "what we are is an incredibly detailed", "116:53", "and we are self aware programs in you", "116:56", "know of silicon matrix of you know so", "117:00", "that argument is brilliant I mean you", "117:02", "know I'd be just from the just from the", "117:03", "point of view of like numbers", "117:05", "um yeah there's lots of reasons to say", "117:07", "that's not possible but but it's you", "117:08", "know raises this issue of like yeah what", "117:10", "is simulation but if you were in a", "117:12", "simulation the whole matrix thing if you", "117:14", "were in a simulation that was that real", "117:15", "how would you know yeah how could you", "117:17", "know there are me we're going to be if", "117:20", "you allow technology to continue right",
