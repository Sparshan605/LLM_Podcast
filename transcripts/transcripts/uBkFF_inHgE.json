October", "05:57", "so November December January I've", "05:59", "basically three months worth a new shit", "06:02", "which is about 40 minutes of all told", "06:04", "material and then I have 20 other", "06:07", "minutes that are in the there in like", "06:10", "the baking stage like I'm not ready to", "06:13", "take them out of the oven there I fuck", "06:15", "around with them I'll shove them in the", "06:16", "middle a bit some sometimes but they're", "06:18", "not they're not a hundred percent legit", "06:20", "they need to be fleshed out but one of", "06:23", "those became like one of my best bits", "06:26", "now it's weird how that works like", "06:28", "sometimes you'll just find this one part", "06:30", "of it that makes it work and boom all of", "06:32", "a sudden the bits turbocharged so", "06:35", "because of that I usually I decide that", "06:39", "day usually what I'm gonna open with and", "06:41", "then I leave the middle part up to my", "06:46", "imagination and then I decide what I'm", "06:48", "gonna close with but when I ready to do", "06:50", "a Netflix special I basically have it", "06:52", "all mapped out I basically have a", "06:54", "starting point and I have an end point", "06:55", "yeah not even like when I'm filming I", "06:58", "still fuck around and ad-lib because I", "07:01", "don't think because every show I do I", "07:03", "don't I don't have like I'm gonna say it", "07:05", "verbatim this way every time I always", "07:07", "fuck around because I always feel like I", "07:09", "could find a new way that's better if I", "07:11", "just stay loose and so even when I'm", "07:14", "filming I do it that way because I feel", "07:15", "I want this to be like a real show it's", "07:17", "a real show and I always film four shows", "07:20",

"07:28", "alright turn around I thank God for", "07:30", "editing yeah I think I think that's the", "07:34", "way to do it though to be kind of in the", "07:36", "moment and go with how you're feeling", "07:39", "when you're filming something just", "07:40", "because that's the way you would be", "07:42", "anyway yeah ain't but sometimes I've", "07:45", "learned in the past when I'm filming", "07:47", "something I feel like man I'd like to", "07:49", "get everything that I want out on this", "07:51", "special and I don't want to forget", "07:53", "anything you know cuz it'll be nights", "07:55", "where I'm I'm performing and I I forgot", "07:58", "a bit I'm like I'll be searching in my", "08:00", "head for the bit and I'm like I know", "08:02", "there's another something then goes", "08:05", "along this but then I just jump off it", "08:08", "and go into a another routine so for me", "08:12", "I don't know I like to keep it different", "08:14", "every night just trying way around and", "08:17", "it's weird now that a Netflix special", "08:19", "the I just have one came out and I don't", "08:24", "really subscribe to if if I have a", "08:28", "Netflix special out and you come to a", "08:31", "live show you're going to see some of", "08:33", "those bits that I did in the Netflix", "08:35", "special I don't like retire the the act", "08:38", "I know some

some new stuff so I kind of", "08:54", "and I don't know how long that lasts I", "08:57", "don't know like I know some some people", "09:00", "were like oh I saw that on the Netflix", "09:02", "why am I gonna pay to see it live if I", "09:06", "could see it at home but there's", "09:07", "something about going out I believe to a", "09:10", "live show and seeing a live performance", "09:13", "there's different nuances that you might", "09:15", "see in a bit or an add-on like this", "09:17", "sometimes I add on to the joke then my", "09:20", "jokes are sometimes never finished so we", "09:23", "keep adding on so that's the way I've", "09:26", "kind of worked at my entire career yeah", "09:28", "Gaffigan does it that way a lot of Brian", "09:33", "Regan does it that way where guys will", "09:35", "call out bits like they would like if", "09:37", "you go to see Gaffigan he doesn't do hot", "09:39", "pockets you're gonna get fucking mad", "09:41", "mm-hmm that's this a lot of people like", "09:43", "that I retire my material but I have", "09:46", "brought stuff out before if people asked", "09:48", "like someone asked me to bring up", "09:50", "explaining Kim Kardashian's to the", "09:52", "aliens the other night and I was amazed", "09:54", "that I could remember it but I", "09:55", "remembered it but for the most part I", "09:57", "retire ship because I feel like in my", "10:00", "mind if I don't retire things I'm not", "10:03", "going to work on new things as much I'm", "10:06", "going to limit myself and then I always", "10:08", "feel like my newest bits are better than", "10:11", "my older bits because even though I've", "10:12", "been doing stand-up for 30 years", "10:13", "I still think I get better at it I think", "10:17", "it's a constant state of self evaluation", "10:20", "and self analysis and going over the", "10:24", "material and then realize you know you", "10:25", "have enough good sets and bad sets and", "10:28", "great sets you have enough to kind of", "10:30", "recognize the characteristics of each", "10:32", "one where they go wrong and then you get", "10:34", "better at having less bad sets and even", "10:37", "less good sets and more great sets yeah", "10:39", "and you know and I think that for me one", "10:44", "big part of that is constantly writing I", "10:46", "write write I sit down and write right", "10:48", "and I write at one hour every night", "10:52", "after shows that's one big one I write", "10:55", "during the day but the big one for me", "10:57", "seems to be at night when I come home", "10:59", "from the store and I'm jazzed up and", "11:01", "also it's great too because everyone's", "11:04", "it's just me and the dog and I just", "11:06", "fucking sit at that desk and I'll just", "11:08", "work until my eyes start blinking and I", "11:11", "start getting really tired and some of", "11:13", "my best shit I've ever come up with is", "11:15", "that way", "11:16", "well after shows because I'm all juiced", "11:18", "up and then I also have a process of", "11:20", "listening to the show in the car because", "11:23", "you know it's one of the coolest things", "11:25", "about Bluetooth audio that you get your", "11:28", "phone you record it on your phone and", "11:30", "then in the car home you can listen and", "11:32", "you can go I fucked that up or I should", "11:35", "have done it this way or maybe if I do", "11:37", "that or you have an idea I'll pause it", "11:39", "got another idea", "11:40", "yeah and then I make a new voice note", "11:42", "and then I'll go home and I'll listen to", "11:44", "it again I'll listen to my set again and", "11:46", "I'll pause it and then start working on", "11:48", "stuff and that's how I've been able to", "11:50", "expand all these bits pretty quickly", "11:53", "mmm that's interesting I I find my best", "11:56", "bits come out of just living my life and", "11:59", "you know I have a daughter we went to", "12:02", "the zoo and the nuances at the zoo that", "12:05", "I picked up on and I just go out either", "12:09", "tell i-i'll call my mother and I'll tell", "12:11", "her a story and that's kind of my", "12:13", "barometer of whether or not this thing's", "12:14", "gonna work on stage and then I'll go to", "12:16", "the comedy store and kind of flush it", "12:18", "out there but yeah I mean I just never", "12:21", "been the guy who writes I just I don't", "12:26", "know well you don't have to know i yeah", "12:28", "it's working for you there's a lot of", "12:29", "guys who don't do it that way bill burr", "12:31", "doesn't do it that way he's one of the", "12:32", "best ever", "12:33", "yeah a lot of guys who just don't write", "12:35", "for me I feel like it's all about how", "12:37", "much time and energy I put on things and", "12:40", "if I put more time and energy you're", "12:42", "just working on my act because I'm", "12:44", "writing then it's gonna be better", "12:46", "that's just how I look at it yeah yeah", "12:49", "everybody's got their own process and", "12:51", "I'm fascinated to hear guys like", "12:54", "yourself Seinfeld's another guy that", "12:56", "every word is planned out yeah and you", "12:59", "could hear it with him you know you", "13:01", "really hear his act is like a scalpel", "13:03", "you know it's just he's slicing the", "13:05", "perfect slice and he's just he knows", "13:08", "exactly how does that it yeah he's got", "13:10", "perfect timing", "13:11", "he's got you know his use of words is", "13:13", "you know whether or not you you know", "13:17", "meaning anyway any comment can", "13:19", "appreciate that any comment can", "13:20", "appreciate the way he does that you know", "13:23", "there's a lot of guys who like that who", "13:24", "just have that did you ever watch Jenny", "13:26", "at all I have in you know his timing I", "13:29", "think was I think timing in comedy is", "13:33", "something a bit of a lost art I don't", "13:36", "think a lot of comedians are really", "13:39", "taking to timing like they have in the", "13:44", "past and I don't know if they're are", "13:46", "scared of the silence cuz because a lot", "13:48", "of timing is silent and a lot of guys", "13:51", "and and women tend to not relish in", "13:54", "those moments of silence where sometimes", "13:57", "it's it's comedy gold a lot of people", "13:59", "run through the material and for me as", "14:03", "an audience member I like someone who", "14:05", "kind of gives you as an audience member", "14:08", "a little little beat or yeah maybe some", "14:11", "time to kind of marinate in the joke a", "14:13", "little bit opposed to kind of blowing", "14:15", "through the material don't you feel that", "14:16", "like when you're in a large audience", "14:18", "that's even more critical because you", "14:22", "have like there's thousands of people", "14:24", "and it seems like a big pause like in", "14:27", "between punchlines or you give a person", "14:29", "a chance give this whole group of people", "14:31", "a chance to think about how ridiculous", "14:32", "what you just said was yeah it enhances", "14:35", "it oh absolutely I mean especially like", "14:37", "you said in a large audience which is", "14:39", "even more fearful for a comedian to let", "14:42", "the joke breathe yeah as God knows you", "14:46", "know if you've got a thousand people and", "14:48", "then you got 20,000 people I mean you", "14:51", "know 19 more thousand people could yell", "14:55", "or scream or say something so anything", "14:58", "but man to stop and just let that joke", "15:02", "breathe a little bit and just and then", "15:04", "maybe have it percolate there's times", "15:05", "where I'm on stage and and I'll go a", "15:08", "little bit longer than I thought I was", "15:11", "gonna go without talking but maybe give", "15:13", "it like a facial expression or whatnot", "15:16", "just to see if I could eke out another", "15:18", "crescendo of laughter yeah and those are", "15:23", "the moments are really relishing because", "15:24", "sometimes the silence is even better", "15:26", "than saying anything yeah", "15:28", "and you also realize that you're not", "15:30", "like rushing anything yeah you got a", "15:33", "hold of it yeah at least for myself my", "15:35", "act is more like a it needs to needs to", "15:40", "kind of sit I don't
