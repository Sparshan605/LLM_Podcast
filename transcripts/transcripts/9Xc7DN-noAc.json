just meant you weren't starving it's", "24:59", "like they killed all those people", "25:00", "because they were oppressors because", "25:02", "they had more than someone else that's", "25:04", "how they defined it in order to get the", "25:05", "people to rally against it yes yes it", "25:07", "said yes and and that and the definition", "25:09", "kept slipping because well look look", "25:11", "even now it's like well let's say we", "25:13", "rally against the 1% you know and those", "25:15", "would be the money owners let's say it's", "25:17", "like okay who's in that group well", "25:20",

you in the one percent worldwide", "25:32", "right right so does that make all of us", "25:34", "oppressors basically everybody who lives", "25:36", "above poverty in America is in the one", "25:38",

"26:21", "left and you say well you're more", "26:22", "virtuous than a right winger it's like", "26:24", "well who cares that's obvious because", "26:25", "the right wingers are you know", "26:27",

effort on my part if", "26:46", "I can figure out some way of classifying", "26:48", "that previously virtuous person as an", "26:52", "oppressor along some dimension then all", "26:54", "of a sudden I get an increment my moral", "26:55", "virtue and that happened all the time in", "26:58", "these leftist revolutions run amok that", "27:00", "was just a constant feature so it's not", "27:03", "good it's not good why is it this is", "27:07", "something that's always puzzled me why", "27:09", "is it that the left is defined by", "27:13", "there's like certain there's certain", "27:14",

"there's there's certain qualities that", "27:30", "are always attributed to conservatives", "27:32", "and then there's certain qualities or is", "27:34", "in that and these are social things and", "27:36", "that I'm not quite sure I understand", "27:38", "like why is it that the left is always", "27:41", "associated in support of gay rights the", "27:44", "left is always associated in support of", "27:46", "you know of all races and all genders", "27:50", "and I think it's the dispossessed issue", "27:52", "again so imagine okay imagine that we", "27:57", "make these hierarchies and they're", "28:00", "hierarchies that are devoted towards a", "28:01", "goal and that the sum total of all those", "28:03", "hierarchies is something like the", "28:05", "patriarchy even though I hate that word", "28:07", "and so whether I should use it I don't", "28:09", "like that word at all but but but that's", "28:10", "we're speaking within the confines of", "28:12", "that theory it's defining how you're", "28:14", "using it what do you mean by the", "28:15", "patriarchy well the patriarchy is is is", "28:18", "the sum total of all Western hierarchies", "28:20", "let's say it sorts the left", "28:22", "it's the radical leftist vision of the", "28:24", "sum total of all Western hierarchy it's", "28:26", "always male well that's the theory is", "28:29", "that it's male-dominated and you know", "28:31", "what has a patriarchy ism yeah yes well", "28:34", "and it's a funny thing because of course", "28:35", "there's lots of elements there's lots of", "28:37", "sub elements of the patriarchy that", "28:38", "aren't male-dominated so pretty", "28:40", "healthcare for example", "28:42", "universities the education system in", "28:44", "general there's lots of places where the", "28:46", "these these sub elements are female", "28:49", "dominated but so I don't know whether", "28:50", "defined as the patriarchy I'm do not", "28:52", "define healthcare oh it's a good", "28:54", "question Jo I don't know what", "28:56", "if if you have a sub-element of the", "28:58", "patriarchy that's dominated by women is", "29:00", "that still the patriarchy it's like the", "29:03", "structures still intact it's still", "29:04", "performing the same function well now", "29:06", "the women are running it well is that", "29:08", "the patriarchy and the answer to that is", "29:09", "well we're all vague about what the", "29:11", "definition is so we don't need to", "29:13", "address that issue well here's the", "29:14", "answers here's some clear ones right", "29:16", "like major corporations the vast", "29:18", "majority of CEOs are male yeah we think", "29:20", "of that as part of the patriarchy yeah", "29:22", "government you know never been a male", "29:24", "never been a female president vast", "29:27", "majority of Senators Congressmen etc", "29:29", "male yeah so I guess we could say well", "29:31", "the patriarchy is all those elements of", "29:33", "hierarchical structure that are still", "29:35", "dominated by men law enforcement", "29:37", "military male mostly male right but it's", "29:40", "a it's a peculiar definition right", "29:42", "because it means you have to you have to", "29:45", "fractionate the patriarchy into pieces", "29:48", "you can't you you can no longer talk", "29:49", "about it as a uniform structure if", "29:51", "you're gonna take out all those pieces", "29:52", "that are dominated by women say well", "29:54", "that's not the patriarchy but the thing", "29:56", "is is that the whole concept is so we", "29:58", "all define that it's that it bag our", "30:00", "description but so is you our though", "30:01", "right I mean it's well that's that's the", "30:03", "other thing that's the claim the other", "30:04", "claim is that all hierarchies are", "30:06", "predicated on power which is a claim", "30:08", "that's absolutely appalling it's like", "30:09", "plumbers they part of the hierarchy", "30:12", "hierarchy", "30:13", "you've got roaming bands of armed", "30:15", "aggressive tyrannical plumbers coming to", "30:18", "your door saying use our service or else", "30:20", "that's not how

go look for the person who's most", "30:31", "competent and one of the things the left", "30:33", "can't tolerate is the idea that", "30:35", "hierarchies are predicated in part even", "30:38", "on competence which they clearly are the", "30:41", "best predictors for success in Western", "30:43", "hierarchies are intelligence and", "30:44", "conscientiousness those are the best", "30:46",

"don't fit so easily and I think that is", "31:14", "a matter of the consequence of", "31:16", "hierarchical structures is that so", "31:18", "imagine in every hierarchy there are", "31:19", "some

know and it was", "42:50", "really fun to watch the teams were", "42:52", "pretty equal which is something that you", "42:53", "want so that everybody can expand their", "42:57", "skills while they're

it was a beautiful goal", "43:06", "and it was 4-3 and that was the end of", "43:07", "it right and all my kids team there is", "43:09", "the kid who is the star and he was a", "43:11", "pretty good

but then life isn't the", "43:56", "championship life is a whole bunch of", "43:59", "championships it's a whole sequence of", "44:01", "them and so what you're actually trying", "44:03", "to train your son to do is to be a", "44:05", "contender in the entire series and the", "44:08", "way you do that is by helping him", "44:10", "develop his character and the character", "44:12", "is actually

that", "46:49", "instance you weren't on top it's more", "46:52", "trivial in games than it is in fights", "46:55", "and it's also the response is much more", "46:59", "negative to the from the fans

think", "47:12", "it's more important in fights than it is", "47:14", "in games why do you think it is because", "47:15", "the consequences are so grave because", "47:17", "you recognize that the high is much", "47:19", "higher and the lows are much lower to", "47:21", "lose a basketball game sucks but it's", "47:23", "nothing like losing a fight there's no", "47:25", "comparison it's not even so

you", "73:12", "are your most fundamentally that which", "73:15", "if it confronts its problems can solve", "73:18", "them and that's the hero myth in in a", "73:20", "nutshell by the way the hero is

things I talk about is well", "76:22", "why do you think why bother thinking", "76:24", "it's like you think well that's obvious", "76:27", "it's like no actually it's not so", "76:28", "obvious it's like the issue that I", "76:31", "discussed with my students at university", "76:33", "a lot is well why write a good essay my", "76:36", "bother what to get the grade it's like", "76:37", "no that's not why and if you think that", "76:40", "well that's better than not thinking", "76:42", "that there's any reason for writing but", "76:44", "it's a bad reason why write well writing", "76:46", "is a form of thinking it's actually the", "76:48", "most demanding form of thinking I would", "76:51", "say there's other forms that are", "76:52", "demanding so how do you write a good", "76:55", "essay pick a topic that matters to you", "76:57", "because if you're not writing about", "76:59", "something that matters to you it's like", "77:01", "you're not living something that's", "77:03",

what", "137:27", "happened in the Kathy Newman interview", "137:28", "no that could have gone really sideways", "137:31", "like I was lucky there to some degree", "137:32", "because she interviewed me for 40", "137:35", "minutes or whatever and something like", "137:37", "that and then they did chop it down to", "137:40", "seven minutes or three minutes and it", "137:41", "was exactly what you'd

the whole interview", "137:59", "and the reason they put up the whole", "138:01", "interview was because they thought the", "138:02", "interview went fine it isn't that they", "138:05", "knew that

it's", "149:12", "certainly easier to listen to a book on", "149:14", "tape for me than it is to read a book", "149:16", "yeah well so for us so the question is", "149:18", "for how many people is that true and I", "149:19", "would say it might be true for them for", "149:21", "the majority of people and then people", "149:23", "are doing hybrids you know so because", "149:25", "you can sync

than that I know that's by", "151:28", "design but you also don't edit it it's", "151:30", "like what you see is what you get it's", "151:31", "like everyone's relieved by that we can", "151:33",

"151:40", "leave in and what to take out and it's", "151:43", "just well that's partly also why I deal", "151:45", "with the press the way I do yeah if I'm", "151:47", "gonna have a full conversation it's like", "151:48", "I'm willing to take the hits yeah and", "151:50", "and I understand what you're saying but", "151:52", "that's one of the reasons why it", "151:53", "frustrates me so much is that I see what", "151:55", "they're doing and I'm like what you're", "151:56", "doing is ancient what you're doing is", "151:59", "it's it's this is what people did twenty", "152:01", "years ago thirty years ago for you can't", "152:03", "really do that anymore", "152:04", "you can't misrepresent people you used", "152:06", "to be able to if you were in the press", "152:07", "you could take people quote amount of", "152:09", "context do whatever the fuck you wanted", "152:11", "put an article about them they couldn't", "152:12", "do a goddamn thing about it it happened", "152:14", "to me in nineteen", "152:17", "it was like ninety-nine", "152:20", "I did a I had a comedy CD that came out", "152:23", "and this woman wrote an article about it", "152:24", "and it just she just lied she

wow I'd", "152:48", "never experienced that before I was like", "152:50", "this is stunning and then I found out", "152:51", "this person did that a lot and this is", "152:53", "what she did and there's ultimate power", "152:56", "that comes at being the person who has", "152:57", "the pen being the person who has the", "152:59", "typewriter and you you're the person who", "153:00", "works

well that that's that that it may", "153:41", "also be the position that I increasingly", "153:43", "find myself in I think it's the right", "153:45", "position because then the", "153:47", "misrepresentations don't exist anymore", "153:48", "so then the only problem is the dispute", "153:50", "over the actual ideological", "153:52", "conversations or the other the actual", "153:55",

enough", "154:23", "of that I mean it would be easier for me", "154:26", "in many ways if I just stopped doing it", "154:28", "but but there's some utility and having", "154:31", "it play out and so",

yeah I mean look", "180:29", "again I don't know what the hell I'm", "180:32", "talking about okay this is all a mystery", "180:34", "to me", "180:35", "the fact that my daughter was so sick", "180:37", "see the one thing that I did know cuz I", "180:39", "scoured the literature on arthritis when", "180:41", "she was a kid the scientific literature", "180:42", "and because we were interested in the", "180:44", "dietary connection and the only thing I", "180:46", "could find that was reliable was that if", "180:48", "people with arthritis fasted their", "180:51", "symptoms reliably went away and that's", "180:53", "actually a well-documented finding but", "180:55", "then if they started to eat again then", "180:57", "there were symptoms came back and I", "180:59",

from the diet your body", "181:41", "becomes a custom with well one of the", "181:43", "thighs Isis that we've been pursuing and", "181:46", "there's some justification for this and", "181:47", "the scientific literature is that the", "181:49", "reason that you lay on layers of fat is", "181:52", "because the fat acts as a buffer between", "181:54", "you and the toxic things that you're", "181:56", "eating because fat is actually an organ", "181:58", "it has functions other than merely the", "181:59", "storage of of calories and maybe when", "182:02", "you strip out that protective

removing it", "182:12", "from your constant diet I don't bloody", "182:14", "well know well I would think it would be", "182:16", "much more likely that because you think", "182:17", "about people who are alcoholics they", "182:19", "develop a tolerance to alcohol", "182:20", "you know you get off of that and then", "182:22", "you have a drink and your tolerances are", "182:24", "shot and then you immediately have a", "182:26", "reverse reaction to the alcohol yeah", "182:28", "same thing with marijuana yeah when", "182:30", "people do it all the time you your body", "182:32", "becomes tolerant well I think I think", "182:34", "that the layering of fat on might be", "182:36", "part of the tolerance mechanism hmm so", "182:39", "it's not merely a matter of", "182:40", "caloric intake it's a matter of of toxic", "182:43", "telluric intake buffered by whatever it", "182:45", "is that fat is doing as a neuro", "182:47", "endocrine organ but again like I said I", "182:50", "said I'm out of
