attention is because he said that he", "95:05", "doesn't see how conservation helps", "95:07", "elephants which okay that's one thing", "95:10", "but then he said or any other animals", "95:12", "and I'm like wait a second okay you", "95:14", "can't we can't say conservation hunting", "95:16", "as a conservation tool doesn't help any", "95:18", "other animals because we've proven here", "95:20", "in North America it's that it's a model", "95:22", "that works so I didn't like how he", "95:24", "worded that and lumped that on together", "95:26", "and I'm like was that I was was that", "95:29", "just a poorly worded tweet what's going", "95:31", "on here so then he said he's gonna look", "95:33", "at that ban regarding elephants because", "95:37", "you know if there's no value on the", "95:38", "animals we know what we know what", "95:40", "happens and if there is no hunting it's", "95:44", "pretty much the death sentence of the", "95:45", "animal", "95:46", "well the we'd probably have to explain", "95:48", "that to a lot of people that don't know", "95:49", "what we're talking about but Africa", "95:51", "there's a lot of animals in Africa that", "95:53", "we're on the verge

they created a lot of", "96:03", "these game preserves where they had", "96:06", "these animals and they had a financial", "96:09", "interest in keeping these animals alive", "96:11", "because people paid a lot of money to", "96:13", "come over there and hunt them so now", "96:14", "these animals that were on the verge of", "96:16", "extinction just a couple of decades ago", "96:17", "are thriving

they're in a weird predicament", "96:31", "because it's hunting that's keeping", "96:33", "these animals alive and it seems like a", "96:35", "contradiction like how could hunting be", "96:38",

it's not even remotely", "97:21", "comparable hunters are making the", "97:23", "difference there and we put our money", "97:24", "where our mouth is you know we say we", "97:26", "care about it we pay for it we we put", "97:28", "money there to help conservation and pay", "97:30", "for the biologists and pay for the", "97:32", "studies and pay for habitat enhancement", "97:35", "and so that's that essentially is the", "97:38", "same thing that needs to happen in", "97:39", "Africa is but it's it's weird to say", "97:41", "well how can the United States regulate", "97:43", "what happens in Africa because we can't", "97:45", "really right but we can say we're not", "97:48", "going to allow the trophies to come home", "97:49", "so that pretty much stops the hunting in", "97:52", "Africa so yeah we're not saying you can", "97:54", "or can't hunt you can still go do it you", "97:56", "just can't bring them home which", "97:57", "essentially stops hunting without", "97:59", "hunting those animals don't have value", "98:01", "no and no matter how you want to slice", "98:03", "it or phrase it or whatever you want if", "98:06", "they don't have value they're not gonna", "98:09",

"98:31", "this this council was about to try to", "98:33", "make a good decision on how best to", "98:35", "regulate the trophies coming home and", "98:37", "and maybe we can help promote hunting", "98:41", "and and how to do a ride and what it", "98:43", "means as a council so that's I'm", "98:46", "involved in that I used that opportunity", "98:50", "to talk to him about other things too", "98:52", "but so I don't know I don't know where", "98:55", "it's all gonna gonna lead it's it's a", "98:57", "fascinating subject because elephants", "99:00", "are endangered in some parts of Africa", "99:02", "but Africa is in an enormous place yeah", "99:04", "and in other parts of Africa they have a", "99:06", "problem with elephants yeah so going to", "99:09", "those places and shoot", "99:10", "elephants to most people is a horrific", "99:12", "offense yeah so but the problem is I", "99:15", "don't I don't see the amount of money", "99:17", "that someone has to pay to go and shoot", "99:20", "an elephant", "99:20", "it's a crazy amount of money", "99:22", "seventy-five thousand that's a lot of", "99:23", "fucking money how many people are", "99:25", "spending seventy five thousand dollars", "99:26", "to go look at them or help them they're", "99:28", "not going to they're not going to know", "99:30", "and so and when you say well that money", "99:32", "could come from photo safaris no and", "99:35", "also with the seventy five grand to take", "99:37", "a picture and for a photo safari where", "99:40", "they have them set up is that they go", "99:41", "into pretty much the same route so the", "99:43", "habitat just gets hammered I mean you", "99:44", "know what a National Monument or a", "99:46", "national park here the most popular", "99:49", "places you know what those look like yes", "99:51", "it fricking dump so when you have those", "99:54", "photos as far as they go on the same", "99:55", "track basically you're hammering the", "99:56", "habitat

very smart guy but", "106:30", "he's also a very nice guy yeah I just", "106:32", "kept asking questions and pestering", "106:34", "people and getting to the heart of it", "106:35", "but he also showed like these fenced-in", "106:38", "lions and they're throwing a dead cow", "106:39", "over the top of the fence and the line I", "106:41", "didn't turn it apart it's fucking crazy", "106:43", "I didn't see it but it's it's weird", "106:45", "because the these Lions they're never", "106:48", "wild like they're feeding them and then", "106:51", "people go over there and hunt them as if",

and this is something that", "107:15", "most people aren't aware of that there's", "107:18", "a code and that cut the code very", "107:21", "slightly like in some places you can use", "107:24",

can't", "107:33", "do that in Montana yeah you know there's", "107:35", "there's different things of what people", "107:36", "decide is fair change right or ethical", "107:39", "and it depends like

"origin but I think they are legal now", "107:58", "but yeah I mean as far as so you're", "108:01", "trying to define what is", "108:02", "right and so yeah there's a lot of these", "108:04", "electronics as for that but what we say", "108:07", "is fair chase is not in a high fence", "108:09", "well it's definitely not feeding a lion", "108:11", "in a cage and then opening up the door", "108:14", "right when the hunter pulls up yeah oh", "108:18", "yeah that is what they do yeah it's one", "108:20", "of the reasons why a lot of these lines", "108:22", "that get shot they don't know what the", "108:23", "fuck is going on they're bedded", "108:25", "somewhere they just lay down yeah as", "108:27", "they're outside in this new environment", "108:28", "like where am I", "108:29", "you don't even know what it is because", "108:30", "they've been living in this very small", "108:31", "environment and they let him out and", "108:33", "they let him out right when the hunter", "108:35", "gets there yeah that's that's tougher to", "108:38", "justify it's very tough to justify so I", "108:40", "feel like it's it's it's not justifiable", "108:43", "yes you're not hunting anymore you're", "108:45", "just murdering an animal yeah so it's", "108:47", "not murder murders a person No", "108:49", "so I'm gonna I'm gonna not address that", "108:53", "part and just address hunting in general", "108:55", "and hunting in general is what's", "108:58", "necessary for the the future of animals", "109:02", "I mean you had until it gets down to a", "109:05", "number where maybe the white or black or", "109:07", "whatever Rhino that is that's only down", "109:09", "to a handful obviously you're not gonna", "109:11", "hunt those but by and large hunting is", "109:15", "what keeps these animals the population", "109:17", "viable well and then there was also the", "109:19", "case of Cory Knowles who went over there", "109:22", "yeah Knowlton no no no - Cory Knowlton", "109:26", "Knowlton yep that I say his name yep", "109:28", "sorry Cory we got it why did I say no", "109:32", "but yeah I have too many names in my", "109:34", "head but anyway when Cory went over", "109:35", "there in Cory's don't talk about spa", "109:36", "smoking you think but that's what people", "109:40", "like to say right yeah people I do a lot", "109:42", "of stupid shit let's have a pop quiz", "109:44", "motherfucker see what those boar shit", "109:46", "but when Cory went over there he spent a", "109:49", "quarter of a million dollars to shoot an", "109:52", "endangered rhino", "109:53", "I think it was 350,000 wasn't it much I", "109:56", "think he's I mean it was a lot a lot of", "109:58", "money hundreds of thousands of dollars", "110:00", "and he said that it was undervalued and", "110:03", "he said the reason why the bidding", "110:04", "didn't get higher was because there was", "110:06", "almost pressure on people to do it but", "110:08", "he explained very eloquently and very", "110:11", "clearly on CNN and when he did my", "110:14", "podcast about all that", "110:15", "threats Adobe said listen yeah that", "110:17", "Rhino was killing other Ryan right", "110:19", "that is why not breeding not breeding it", "110:22", "was it was an old Rhino that was past", "110:24", "its breeding prime it wasn't breeding", "110:26", "anymore and it was killing the young", "110:28", "rhinos he had killed a female that had", "110:30", "tried to mate with and it had killed", "110:32", "another male and it was they were these", "110:35", "are this is an endangered animal and", "110:37", "this thing was killing other animals", "110:39", "rights they decided look we have to take", "110:41", "this out of the population so what does", "110:44", "money through it yeah a tremendous", "110:46", "amount of money that can go for", "110:48", "anti-poaching efforts and all these", "110:49", "different things and so he explained it", "110:51", "like I think this is this is an animal", "110:54", "that they were going to kill they had to", "110:56", "kill it because it was threatening this", "110:58", "endangered population of only like a", "111:00", "couple of thousand rhinos right right", "111:02", "yeah it's a really interesting situation", "111:06", "and people would like it if that wasn't", "111:09", "the case they would like it if no the", "111:11", "money is actually coming from animal", "111:13", "welfare groups and from wildlife lovers", "111:15", "who just want to see these animals alive", "111:17", "yeah the difference is it's very rare", "111:20", "that someone's going to give you", "111:22", "$350,000 to keep a rhino a lot and so", "111:25", "that that's a magnified example but", "111:28", "that's pretty much what's happening with", "111:30", "all the animals I mean you're not", "111:31", "getting that much money but you're", "111:32", "getting money in exchange for their life", "111:35", "basically and it's for the betterment of", "111:37", "the herd yeah I mean that's hunting yeah", "111:39", "right I mean that's that's like like I", "111:42", "said very magnified because you're", "111:44", "getting a huge amount of money and", "111:45", "there's only a few animals but you can", "111:47", "it's easy to see hey killing this one is", "111:49", "gonna save animals so that's really easy", "111:51", "to see but that's pretty much what", "111:53", "happens with all animals I mean your", "111:55", "balance he not heard the other thing is", "111:56", "they ate that Rhino and a lot of people", "111:58", "ate that Rhino I mean they gave you a", "112:00", "meat away to villages and people don't", "112:02", "know you yet not only can you eat rhinos", "112:05", "apparently they taste good same thing", "112:06", "with elephant elephant apparently tastes", "112:08", "delicious well do you remember in the", "112:10", "trophy movie they they could care less", "112:14", "what elephant that guy killed but they", "112:17", "didn't like that it was small right do", "112:19", "you remember that me because they wanted", "112:20", "more meat yeah they don't care about", "112:22", "they want it they care about eating yeah", "112:25", "so I mean as far as the locals go I mean", "112:29", "so we here in America it feels like you", "112:32", "know we take up these causes and it's", "112:35", "like you know we're the social justice", "112:38", "warriors for the world it's like we", "112:41", "ought to probably check in with people", "112:43", "that actually live there right yeah they", "112:44",
