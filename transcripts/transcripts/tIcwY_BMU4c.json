it's the main", "07:22", "thing is how how I everybody saw that", "07:24", "movie and that that's how they would you", "07:26", "know that's that's the reality", "07:28", "you know how fiction is kind of a basis", "07:30", "for reality so Sicario to comes out and", "07:33", "it's basically the United States", "07:35", "declaring the cartels a terrorist", "07:37", "organization you know and I saw that and", "07:39", "I was like hmm usually fiction kind of", "07:44", "week it kind of has a way of influencing", "07:47", "reality further on the line you know", "07:49", "that Denzel Washington movie called", "07:52", "siege were the budget terrorists", "07:54", "attacked New York and then militarized", "07:55", "New York and that's kind of like a", "07:57", "president for 9/11 mm-hmm", "07:59", "so you'd see Sicario too and then you", "08:01", "know we're gonna terrorists", "08:03", "Trump now says they're gonna just", "08:05", "thinking about declaring the cartels as", "08:08", "a terrorist organization that's pretty", "08:11", "interesting", "08:11", "mainly because realistically Mexico has", "08:16", "been calling them terrorists forever", "08:18", "yeah what did you think about that about", "08:20", "Trump doing that do you think that", "08:22", "actually is something that can happen if", "08:24", "you're gonna militarize efforts against", "08:26", "it not just
