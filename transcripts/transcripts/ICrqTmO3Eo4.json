best", "26:30", "and I was I love it too much you know", "26:33", "and not having the crowd there I think", "26:36", "so I don't I think it helped me so much", "26:39", "and I think it's gonna carry whether", "26:40", "there's crowd or no crowd in the future", "26:42", "I think it's going to benefit me so much", "26:43", "because I was able to understand that", "26:45", "the crowd does influence

with no crowd so it was like it was", "27:30", "supercool like he's going on and saying", "27:32", "that he would have I don't know if he", "27:35", "would have because if you look at the", "27:36", "three fights prior to that there's a", "27:38", "huge difference in your in your range", "27:40", "and your balance shoulders like he's", "27:42", "he's out range he you out range Vic you", "27:44",

said", "53:12", "don't take late", "53:14", "world title fights this is way different", "53:16", "you know yeah just the implications I", "53:19", "was different you had a statement one of", "53:22", "the things you said when you first", "53:23", "entered the UFC you said I'm gonna put", "53:25", "on some incredible fights and I'm gonna", "53:27", "lose and I'm probably gonna get knocked", "53:29", "out nobody says that it's crazy he says", "53:33", "it was so did you say a long time I'm", "53:35", "like stop saying that shitty shit but", "53:39", "that's this but that's the key to him", "53:42", "like he doesn't hesitate like if I do", "53:44", "anything as a coach I gotta pull him", "53:45", "back and that's a great thing like I've", "53:48", "been a motivator my whole career I've", "53:50", "the psychology I'm a great technician", "53:52", "but my psychology is tricking people to", "53:57", "win is how do you get out there and do", "53:59", "it and and making them to believe you", "54:01", "have to force your head into something", "54:03", "to make something happen", "54:04", "you have to go out there and fight and", "54:07", "that's hard for a lot of people this guy", "54:09", "it's like pulling people back is a great", "54:11", "thing it's like that's that's it's still", "54:13", "hard to do at times like not with him", "54:14", "but the fighters just go too hard to hit", "54:16", "rage and rage is hard to send them down", "54:18", "when someone hits rage like someone says", "54:20", "something about your mama I'm always", "54:21", "like they don't even know your mama it", "54:26", "was a great moment after the second", "54:28", "round after you got hit with that", "54:29", "uppercut well you came back to the", "54:31", "corner and you told them take something", "54:33", "off your punches take about ten percent", "54:35", "off just hit him a clean shot so you", "54:36", "trying to murder him with every shot and", "54:38", "then you made that adjustment and that's", "54:40", "that was really interesting because a", "54:42", "lot of times coaches would tell stuff to", "54:44", "fighters and the fighters probably know", "54:46", "somewhere in their head but it's fucking", "54:48", "with them that they're starting to get", "54:49", "tired it's fucking with them if they got", "54:51", "hit and then I lose some composure they", "54:53", "get emotional and they go out there and", "54:55", "they want out making mistakes you", "54:56", "immediately adjust it and you went out", "54:59", "there and you would see like by the end", "55:00", "of that second round when Tony hit you", "55:02", "with that shot people were like well", "55:03", "maybe this is a shift in the direction", "55:06", "of the fight nope the shift was the", "55:08", "opposite way you came out in the third", "55:10", "round more technical and he came out and", "55:13", "did exactly what Trevor said yeah so we", "55:16", "worked long and hard on that I trust him", "55:21", "with you know with everything as he said", "55:22", "you know we wouldn't be here with my", "55:23", "coach if I didn't trust him with my life", "55:25", "and with what everything I go in there", "55:27", "to do so when he said that's use about", "55:32", "10% also I the crazy thing is is you", "55:35", "only see 10% of the interaction between", "55:37", "us right in between rounds I'm right now", "55:39", "I'm actually with you talking to you see", "55:41", "trying to get that whole that whole", "55:43", "thing but um yeah was uh hold up see", "55:46", "trying to get what though cuz you want", "55:52", "to hear it and watch because I don't", "55:54", "remember it you know right it's just", "55:57", "like when you come to me in the fifth", "55:59", "round and I was laughing and I just", "56:00", "asked the reason I was laughing is", "56:02", "because I just asked him I said was that", "56:03", "the end of the second or third round and", "56:05", "they're like I was like no fucking way", "56:08", "I'm in that good of shape I was like no", "56:09", "way and that's what that's when they cut", "56:12", "in you know so you don't see there's so", "56:14", "much you don't see in that interaction", "56:15", "between me and him and it's so important", "56:17", "for fighters to see that adjustment and", "56:19", "how his endurance leveled off because it", "56:22", "was like you you were having these wild", "56:25", "exchanges and you were put you or", "56:27", "fucking hit and Tony first of all Tony", "56:29", "Ferguson is made out of metal", "56:31", "I mean what's crazy especially when", "56:34", "you're talking about a body type like", "56:35", "you were talking earlier about yes I won", "56:37", "with a frail body type he doesn't have a", "56:38", "chiseled neck right he's not built like", "56:41", "Mark is it's so unique to me so tough", "56:43", "he's so fucking makes me what is it a", "56:45", "choices but there's there's also a key", "56:48", "like if if a fighter can take something", "56:50", "on understanding coach ability is like", "56:52", "you have to have your reactions but you", "56:54", "also have to have your responses like", "56:55", "reactive stuff is like like jabs", "56:57", "positional stuff is reactive like you", "56:59", "have to be able to react positions first", "57:01", "I love jujitsu because it's its position", "57:04", "before submission you have to react to", "57:06", "positions before anything else so", "57:08", "there's reactive stuff but the responses", "57:11", "is why you have a co-pilot to help you", "57:13", "see what you can't see and start", "57:15", "noticing that or how are you playing", "57:17", "defense and using a jab to find openings", "57:20", "where you're still working but you're", "57:22", "thinking and going oh every time he does", "57:23", "this he's dropping his hand and you're", "57:25", "able to see things that's where you have", "57:27", "to be responsive and you have to be", "57:28", "aware in the moment where a lot of times", "57:30", "people can't they just bite down they", "57:32", "just bite down on them I don't even very", "57:34", "similar to the way you used to fight was", "57:35", "bite down their eyes are getting big oh", "57:37", "that's my responses like did you do", "57:40", "they're gonna fall and again that is a", "57:43", "very important point is a coach and the", "57:45", "athlete understanding I am there to help", "57:48", "you with your responses in the gym I'm", "57:50", "gonna create your reactions I'm going to", "57:51", "create your patterns your basic", "57:53", "fundamental patterns that's gonna help", "57:54", "you win positions and slightly win", "57:57", "rounds where you're controlling the", "57:58", "fight the other piece is how am i slowly", "58:00", "creating momentum to get finishes it was", "58:04", "pretty stunning how well you you adapted", "58:07", "and then also how your endurance leveled", "58:10", "off like so because you you did seem", "58:13", "like you were slowing down a little bit", "58:14", "at the second round but it was because", "58:16", "you were sprinting because you were", "58:18", "throwing these full power fucking", "58:20", "haymakers but then when you leveled off", "58:22", "in that third round then it's like you", "58:24", "had an endless gas tank that was", "58:26", "interested you're in control yourself if", "58:27", "you're making decisions it's a lot easy", "58:28", "on your psyche yeah when you're trying", "58:31", "to just fight out of things all the time", "58:32", "again you're not gonna in control if you", "58:34", "can't control your thought you cannot", "58:36", "control your breathing", "58:37", "how stunned were you that Tony to take", "58:39", "those shots in the fight you know I just", "58:43", "know there's no point where I where I", "58:45", "even understand you weren't thinking it", "58:47", "was just throwing it you know it was", "58:49", "crazy", "58:50", "the shots I hit you know John's our Vic", "58:54", "Barboza and strolling with I was so", "58:57", "surprised I went to sleep you know I", "59:00", "didn't understand why I think it was", "59:02", "positioned mostly but yeah I was when I", "59:05", "was hitting it with some of those shots", "59:06", "especially the one when I came through", "59:08", "it he was doing an uppercut I couldn't", "59:09", "believe he didn't go to sleep with that", "59:11", "but I go back to the Michael Johnson", "59:13", "fight when he hit me with that left hand", "59:14", "there's no reason I shouldn't have went", "59:16", "to sleep then so I I don't I haven't", "59:18", "figured that part out see when he", "59:22", "knocked up for you at that same one of", "59:23", "the sharp his left

let's explain this for", "101:00", "people that are just listening he had", "101:02", "this one foam the ev8 cheaper foam and", "101:04", "Justins dropping was that a ball-bearing", "101:07", "or just a marble big and then it hits", "101:11", "that cheap foam and it bounces like", "101:13", "crazy but when it hits the technology", "101:15", "foam it stops dead in its tracks because", "101:18", "it completely absorbs the em think about", "101:19", "water the faster you hit it the more use", "101:21", "the MOR the faster you'll stop if you go", "101:26", "into it slow you just kind of slide",

drop the", "101:34", "bigger ball in there that's crazy now", "101:37", "drop it on then when those other ones", "101:38", "it'll actually pinch the the foam", "101:41", "through it and do it so you think about", "101:43", "gloves how many times are you hitting", "101:44", "something and in boxing you're not", "101:47", "you're not allowed to spar with the", "101:49", "gloves of your hidden bags

a boot back behind it so that", "102:29", "protects that spot so you'll see it pop", "102:32", "out so it's foamed back behind where you", "102:35", "actually zip in so that's all protected", "102:37", "on the soft spot and I have not found it", "102:40", "a shin guard out there 90% of shin", "102:42", "guards aren't left or right either you", "102:43", "kind of just kept front to your body you", "102:45", "look at the straps and say which way did", "102:46", "they go", "102:46", "and another pet peeve of mine when I'm a", "102:49", "coach and I got a world-class athlete", "102:50",
