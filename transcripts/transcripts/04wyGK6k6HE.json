well that the comic book", "129:47", "universe is a very interesting one", "129:48", "because obviously these fictional", "129:50", "characters were thought up by single", "129:52", "people and then the fictional characters", "129:55", "were transformed into stories and then", "129:58", "the stories were sent out into a broader", "129:59", "community but then what started to", "130:01", "happen
