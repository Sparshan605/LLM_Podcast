obviously", "28:26", "these of this than these unwritten rules", "28:28", "of you know you won't you wouldn't tell", "28:30", "on this guy of course but you know it's", "28:33", "obvious", "28:33",

down there that that have had", "29:19", "experience up here that want to go down", "29:20", "there right so the culture is ready for", "29:23", "it I think do you think that would help", "29:25", "I don't know when it comes to legalizing", "29:29", "pot up here it hasn't helped down there", "29:30", "as far as lowering things actually made", "29:33", "things kind of worse how does it made", "29:34", "things worse they changed they changed", "29:38", "the they changed what they were", "29:40", "producing so that the reason of the", "29:43", "reason why there's a heroin heroin", "29:44", "epidemic up here and fentanyl epidemic", "29:47", "up here I think has some relationship", "29:50", "with how things got legalized up here", "29:52", "and how they switched um product down", "29:55", "there so lighter colored heroin is", "29:59", "coming down from Mexico and I've seen I", "30:00", "bet I work with law enforcement up here", "30:03", "in the US doing classes and kind of you", "30:06", "know they send me things like what do", "30:07", "you think about that is that and I've", "30:10", "seen that lighter colored heroin pop up", "30:12", "in places as far our officers cause",

different", "30:22", "strain like it's it's a probably a", "30:24", "different strain and it's also the", "30:25", "amount of Sun it gets in the region", "30:27", "where it's been being grown whose height", "30:28", "higher altitude so it's lighter color", "30:31", "not a stinky I don't know but I think", "30:34", "it's a relationship that that kind of", "30:36", "relates to the legalization issue down", "30:38", "there they didn't affect them in the", "30:41", "pockets they just switched product it's", "30:43", "got to be it's such a strange", "30:44", "relationship because the reason why", "30:46", "these drug cartel", "30:47", "have so much powers because they're", "30:49", "selling drugs to the United States yeah", "30:51", "so it's like you have this connection to", "30:54", "this country that has this great big", "30:56", "wall that it wants to build and on one", "30:59", "side everybody's buying up all the", "31:00", "illegal drugs and the other side", "31:02",

"think the main part of the submarine", "31:52", "ownership is maintained maintenance that", "31:54", "was the reason we found it is that it", "31:57", "wasn't properly maintained so it sunk", "31:59", "yeah it it actually no it actually", "32:02", "floated couldn't sink oh and it had a", "32:05", "bunch of things hanging off behind it", "32:07", "but somewhere you'd scare the shit out", "32:10", "of me you can't see where you're going", "32:11", "well so there so yeah I've seen", "32:14", "submarines drones like a squadron of", "32:17", "drones with a bunch of loads on it Wow",

money and they", "35:35", "said ah we'll just say we're selling it", "35:37", "to them to track it well the the", "35:40", "suspicious part is that all of them went", "35:42", "to one specific cartel the Sinaloa", "35:44", "cartel so it sounds like such horseshit", "35:47", "the fact that I mean who went to jail", "35:49", "for that Eric Holder didn't go to jail", "35:51", "oh he should have he
