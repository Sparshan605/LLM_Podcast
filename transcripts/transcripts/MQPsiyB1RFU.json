lives were at stake", "10:28", "we're never worried about and you know", "10:31", "like maybe a typical reaction would be", "10:33", "like oh my god we could have died or", "10:35", "something like that I I was just like I", "10:38", "cussed because I'm like I was mad she", "10:41", "did that and required Roy to act you", "10:46", "know so I was just I cussed and he's", "10:48", "like he's like dude I had to and so we", "10:51", "weren't worried about ourselves we were", "10:53", "just we didn't wanna have to kill", "10:54", "another bear and we weren't nervous", "10:57", "about the situation and I'm like I said", "10:59", "I know and it was like where else am I", "11:02", "gonna have somebody that's on that same", "11:04", "page with me that that's calm in that", "11:05", "situation and not see there", "11:07", "I flash before their eyes just do what", "11:09", "you have to do just to stop the risk", "11:12", "that's never going to happen I'm never", "11:14", "gonna have somebody like that in my life", "11:17", "again and I think about we were you know", "11:21", "we knew the risk were involved in", "11:23", "everything that we did and we embraced", "11:24", "it and we were fine with it and it and", "11:26", "it didn't consume us or anything and", "11:29", "that's that's what I'm gonna miss is", "11:31", "having somebody so on my same page that", "11:34", "I can trust like that you know Roy was", "11:37", "the best you would have to have someone", "11:39", "who's experienced that as many times as", "11:41", "Roy has had where it was a he knew", "11:43", "exactly what he had to do that moment", "11:45", "yeah he did and he said people know what", "11:47", "they have to do it's it's executing that", "11:51", "is what's hard you know and so knowing", "11:54", "what it takes not panicking being in", "11:57", "control and then getting the job done", "11:59", "with one shot very rare", "12:02", "and he was so Roy in those situations", "12:05", "was as I don't know everybody I haven't", "12:10", "been with everybody but I would say he's", "12:12", "as good as anybody that that I know of", "12:14", "you know and uh that's why you know when", "12:19", "he fell and I got the news that he fell", "12:21", "and died I mean I could I could believe", "12:25", "it I guess but I was mad I'm still mad", "12:29", "and I know everything happens for a", "12:31", "reason and I know you know he has a lot", "12:34", "of faith and I know you know we want to", "12:37", "thank everything's going to be okay and", "12:39", "we'll see each other again I know all", "12:41", "that but it still makes me mad because", "12:48", "you know we missed or we missed out on a", "12:52", "lot of experiences we'd still love to", "12:55", "have and we talked about and we were", "12:57", "just like we had these big big goals and", "13:00", "big dreams and I'm mad that that's gone", "13:04", "so it's completely it's not it's not", "13:10", "just understandable it's um it's", "13:12", "something that very few people could", "13:13", "probably relate to the kind of intimate", "13:15", "friendship that you would have with", "13:17", "someone who's experienced those kind of", "13:19", "hunts it's been in in the will", "13:21", "that's done like that moose hunt that", "13:24", "you were talking about what you guys", "13:25", "were deep deep in in the in the", "13:29", "wilderness like that it's it's something", "13:33", "that very few people will ever very few", "13:37", "people ever experienced at that kind of", "13:38", "danger that kind of an intimate moment", "13:41", "in the wilderness just that connection", "13:44", "to the wild that you guys had together", "13:46", "right and so the whole point I guess", "13:50", "with all that is it's people say well", "13:52", "you just your murderous or you want to", "13:55", "kill it's such a small part of what me", "13:58", "and really experienced together the", "14:01", "kills were I mean they were we achieved", "14:05", "our goal that was it it was the journey", "14:09", "it was the Brotherhood it was you know", "14:11", "growing up and that's what that's what", "14:15", "hunting is it's not just you're out", "14:17", "killing it's you're experiencing nature", "14:21", "its most brutal or its most rewarding or", "14:24", "the entire gamut and when when that", "14:28", "makes you who
