talked about this the", "100:47", "other day this is my my take on the the", "100:51", "craziness of nuclear power was that it's", "100:54", "only been around for less than 100 years", "100:55", "and think about in a hundred years all", "100:57", "the different huge cataclysmic disasters", "100:59", "from Chernobyl to Three Mile Island to", "101:03", "this one and Fukushima this is three",

they", "101:38", "they're willing to build something that", "101:40", "they don't have an out clause with they", "101:42", "were just hoping to keep the power on so", "101:44", "they can keep it cooled off they should", "101:46", "have never really wanted to be without", "101:47", "nuclear power and so to sweeten in forty", "101:49", "years yeah I think Norway has moved", "101:51", "towards that as well there's been a", "101:52", "couple European countries that are", "101:53", "considering this now they realize first", "101:55", "of all they're very small you know a lot", "101:57", "of European countries think about the", "101:58", "impact of one nuclear power plant or two", "102:01", "would have had on them you know Japan is", "102:03", "very small and they're seeing they're", "102:04", "seeing the impact of the radiation", "102:05", "pretty far is there some kind of met", "102:07", "this is might this is another O'Brien", "102:09", "dumbshit thing listen there's some kind", "102:11", "of a thing so well that they can almost", "102:15", "just cover entire reactor like like the", "102:18", "shook pewter feels too hot everything's", "102:21", "gonna melt in it everything's clear we I", "102:24", "know it's I don't understand nuclear", "102:26", "science enough to comment on it but from", "102:27", "what I understand they literally can't", "102:29", "cool this thing off and they don't know", "102:31", "what to do and they're pouring ocean", "102:32", "water on it to try to cool off the", "102:33", "reactors they've eaten through their", "102:35",

conversation about nuclear", "104:45", "power and stuff and you asked about the", "104:46", "safety of nuclear power how would that", "104:49", "be an O'Brien moment we're completely", "104:52",

have now the power to cool it down", "105:16", "yeah I mean a lot of what's going on in", "105:18", "a nuclear power plant is keeping it", "105:20", "stable and making sure that there's not",

essentially", "105:38", "eight hours before there was a meltdown", "105:39", "so there's eight hours where they could", "105:42", "just evacuate the area cancer started I", "105:44", "don't know but

saying I'm", "159:22", "just saying that that I don't think that", "159:24", "like it works for everyone okay I think", "159:27", "and I think that like like I think if", "159:29", "Sam Tripoli wanted to like move off a", "159:31", "death squad he can totally do it and he", "159:34", "would probably survive but like I don't", "159:36", "think that it's it's mean I suppose the", "159:38", "way to stay on desktop but also have", "159:40", "their own picture from podcasts with", "159:42", "somebody yeah their picture that's all", "159:45", "reason why I mean you you actually made", "159:48", "a

to stress", "160:28", "though is the reason why it's done as a", "160:30", "group is is is also looking past what", "160:33", "podcasts like I don't really think that", "160:35", "Howard knows that in 20 years podcasts", "160:39", "are gonna be fuckin kicking ass or", "160:41", "anything but one thing I do know that's", "160:43", "coming up is the the the basic future of", "160:46", "cable

I", "161:04", "was saying is death squad TV to me will", "161:06", "is like I'm kind of considering it more", "161:08", "like a this is a channel this is more", "161:10", "than just just you're listening to a", "161:12", "podcast at your house this is like a TV", "161:14", "show Network where each one of these", "161:16", "shows are like it's like being on", "161:18", "research desk squad",

open up your browser pick", "161:51", "a search string of any kind who's gonna", "161:54", "make an RSS feed thought that no one's", "161:55", "doing that it knows my guards well", "161:57", "anyways I'm just saying that you can't", "161:58", "you can do it if you if you're freaking", "162:00", "out about RSS feeds you probably can", "162:01", "easily cut and paste and RSS string no", "162:04",

PayPal a", "162:21", "show donation how many of your network", "162:24", "shows are you actually in every single", "162:27", "every one of them so that's another", "162:28", "thing that's that's I produce them all", "162:30", "there's the only ones I don't do is win", "162:32", "like like to say Brian Cowen or", "162:33", "somebody's doing one in their hotel room", "162:35", "doesn't that drive you crazy to be in", "162:36", "all those different podcasts I mean your", "162:38", "brain must be scattered No", "162:39", "because it's its quality control for", "162:41", "everything I mean

do that if I", "173:09", "wasn't doing a live podcast at the same", "173:11", "time", "173:11", "but anyways and then I get tax and all", "173:15", "that so everything I make there which is",
