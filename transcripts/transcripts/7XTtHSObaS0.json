some", "19:48", "serious work like the amount of actual", "19:50", "physical kinetic work that you have to", "19:52", "do to go up a hill with a hundred and", "19:55", "thirty pound rock on your back like that", "19:57", "like man that's got to get you in some", "20:00", "insane shape no it helps you know I mean", "20:03", "it's just everything helps mixing it up", "20:06", "I do a lot of different things but", "20:07", "that's just one of them now was this", "20:09", "something that you had always done and", "20:11", "then when you got into hunting you just", "20:13", "sort of ramped it up or did you did you", "20:15", "like really get into fitness once you", "20:17", "became a hunter that's another shirt I", "20:19", "have you know ramped it up oh really", "20:21", "is it really yeah it is oh no kidding", "20:23", "but uh no let's see so I started bow", "20:26", "hunting I was just a teenager and it was", "20:31", "I ended up killing a spike bowl out my", "20:32", "very first year I think it was 18 or 19", "20:35", "and that was you know to kill a bull", "20:38", "with the bow where I came from a real", "20:40", "small town", "20:40", "I mean 20-some kids my graduating class", "20:42", "and so a lot of people hunted but to", "20:45", "kill a bull with a bow was like special", "20:48", "and so I got attention for that I was", "20:51", "like this is some positive reinforcement", "20:52", "I'm like you know this after high school", "20:56", "after the high school sports and all", "20:58", "that and trying to find my way trying to", "21:00", "figure out what the heck I was going to", "21:02", "do and so I liked hunting I like the", "21:05", "challenge of it I got some positive", "21:07", "reinforcement from it so I'm like hey", "21:09", "this is pretty cool because I didn't", "21:10", "hardly know anybody who'd killed a bull", "21:12", "with a bow back then and so I was", "21:15", "successful but from there I just wanted", "21:17", "more wanted more of a challenge and then", "21:19", "you know I started to going into the", "21:21", "wilderness into the Oregon's biggest", "21:23", "wilderness ego cap wilderness it's 375", "21:26", "thousand acres and so you can get back", "21:28", "in there away from people and I thought", "21:30", "well now I want to go to the middle of", "21:32", "this wilderness because that would be", "21:34", "even more badass and if I could kill a", "21:36", "bull back there man that would be the", "21:38", "ultimate and so it was just kind of from", "21:41", "there I realized how the physical part", "21:44", "of bow hunting where where it you know", "21:47", "was more important and so I just is kind", "21:49", "of a progression you know I've always", "21:51", "always ran 10ks and different things", "21:53", "like that but", "21:54", "I figured man you can't be in too good a", "21:57", "shape to to challenge that country and", "22:01", "so I just you know I've never I haven't", "22:05", "reached my limit and I'm trying to to", "22:07", "try to become what I always say is the", "22:08", "ultimate predator so it becomes a part", "22:13", "of like your your whole psyche it", "22:16", "becomes a part of like what you're doing", "22:19", "with your life and becomes that the", "22:21", "challenge of it becomes almost as", "22:23", "important as what you're doing itself", "22:25", "like you're not just going out and", "22:27", "getting it out for me you know which I'm", "22:29", "sure you enjoy elk meat yeah but it's", "22:32", "also it's it's almost sort of like a", "22:34", "spiritual quest oh yeah I mean the you", "22:37", "know the most powerful moments I've had", "22:38", "have been in the mountains in the", "22:40", "wilderness after killing a bull because", "22:43", "everything that goes into it you know", "22:45", "it's not just the fact that I killed an", "22:47", "animal it's a it's how much I respect", "22:50", "animal how tough the country is by all", "22:53", "the training it's just accumulation of", "22:56", "all that work and all that investment of", "22:59", "emotion and everything else and so", "23:01", "that's yeah it is it's spiritual I mean", "23:04", "by yourself back there as as raw as it", "23:07", "gets it's tough and eating the animal", "23:10", "that you've killed for I just started", "23:13", "hunting I've been only been hunting a", "23:15", "little over a year year and a half and", "23:17", "for me the most delicious meals the most", "23:20", "satisfying meals I've ever had is", "23:22", "venison that I that I've killed myself", "23:24", "if there's something it's something", "23:27", "intimate about it I guess something but", "23:30", "you're much more attached to what you're", "23:32", "what you're eating mm-hmm and you know", "23:34", "I've never killed anything with a bone", "23:35", "much less a 1,200 pound bull elk with a", "23:38", "bow in the middle of the woods I mean", "23:40", "that's got to ramp it up another notch", "23:42", "oh yeah it's amazing because you're", "23:44", "shooting something with a rifle you know", "23:46", "I shot that mule deer from 200 yards", "23:48", "away that's pretty far yeah you know", "23:50", "you're shooting these animals 30 40", "23:52", "yards away from you and you're and", "23:53", "they're huge", "23:56", "yeah now they're I mean they don't", "23:58", "commit suicide there they are", "24:00", "you know they're used to lions they're", "24:03", "used to being hunted so to get into Bo", "24:05", "Ranger you know in the redzone so to", "24:07", "speak you know that 32", "24:08", "yards that's difficult they're dialed in", "24:12", "they're used to being hunted every", "24:14", "single day I mean they're they're never", "24:15", "turned off and so yeah it's tough and", "24:19", "then you have just basically a sharp", "24:20", "stick you know one arrow got the arrows", "24:23", "laying over there and it's just it's", "24:24", "amazing how lethal with the razor-sharp", "24:27", "broad head and arrow can be and I've", "24:30", "seen you know there's videos of huge", "24:34", "bulls I've killed dropping in seconds", "24:36", "just from that you know quicker even", "24:38", "than maybe a rifle would kill them and", "24:40", "that's a you know that's pretty amazing", "24:43", "but that is pretty amazing well one of", "24:44", "the things about you is because of all", "24:46", "your training because of all this", "24:48", "lifting and exercise that you do you", "24:50", "shoot a really heavy bow you shoot a 90", "24:53", "pound compound bow which for folks who", "24:56", "don't know like a lot of people still", "24:58", "it'll tell you like you don't need to", "25:00", "shoot anything more than 60 mm-hmm but", "25:02", "90 I've never even heard of anybody", "25:04", "shooting in 90 I never even pulled one", "25:06", "until I pulled yours I mean that's", "25:07", "ridiculously I mean that's pretty stout", "25:10", "yeah so you're you're sort of like", "25:13", "adding to like this whole reason why", "25:16", "year you're exercising and all this", "25:18", "fitness and getting you know really", "25:20", "strong and in really great shape", "25:22", "you're you had kind of have to be in", "25:24", "great shape just to use the very weapon", "25:26", "that used to take these animals out yeah", "25:28", "well and it is true you don't you don't", "25:30", "necessarily have to shoot 90 pounds I", "25:32", "mean people do kill there's women out", "25:34", "there bow hunting who are very", "25:35", "successful with the 50 pound bow it's", "25:37", "true you can do it but you know I want", "25:41", "to shoot 90 I what I want on an animal", "25:44", "is I want two holes I want that arrow", "25:46", "blowing through so I have two but two", "25:48", "holes spilling blood that's how I'm", "25:51", "going to recover the animal you know an", "25:53", "arrow kills from hemorrhage so not from", "25:55", "shock like a like a rifle would so to", "25:58", "get that hemorrhage whereas a 50-pound", "26:01", "bow my going half way and it might get", "26:02", "into lungs and it might kill it you know", "26:04", "you might get 12 inches of penetration", "26:05", "if I go clear through that bowl and it's", "26:08", "you know maybe 24 inches across well", "26:10", "there's a 24 inch wound as opposed to 12", "26:13", "inch wound and killing by hemorrhage and", "26:16", "so it's just going to be that much more", "26:18", "lethal in my mind and then if I'm blown", "26:20", "through ribs or through a shoulder or", "26:21", "it's", "26:22", "quartern way hard so I have to go", "26:23", "through maybe 30 inches of mass I'm", "26:27", "going to be able to do that yeah it's", "26:29", "not you know it's not necessary so to", "26:31", "speak but it's what I'm comfortable with", "26:34", "and I think it makes me that more lethal", "26:36", "of a bow hunter how many other dudes are", "26:38", "shooting 90 pounds I'm not sure is there", "26:41", "anybody I don't know prati I'm sure", "26:43", "probably one or two yeah I'm sure", "26:46", "there's there some well I just pulled it", "26:47", "back and I was thinking when I was", "26:49", "pulling it back I was like imagine", "26:50", "pulling this thing back of you just", "26:51", "climbed up the top of a mountain you're", "26:53", "absolutely exhausted and then you have", "26:55", "this one opportunity to see if you ever", "26:56", "had that happen where you know you", "26:58", "you're really exhausted to work to get", "27:00", "to where the elk is and then you're so", "27:03", "tired you have a hard time pulling the", "27:04", "ball no no no that's because you train", "27:07", "hard right yeah no that's that's never", "27:10", "been an issue um no but it's because you", "27:14", "prepare yeah the average person I mean", "27:16", "90 pounds is it's really difficult to", "27:19", "lift I mean you're essentially you're", "27:20", "using two hands sort of but a bulk of", "27:23", "the work has got to be in your right arm", "27:25", "right yeah I mean it's it's difficult", "27:27", "you know what we're I think would be", "27:28", "more difficult as if you're sitting in a", "27:29", "tree stand for hours", "27:31", "freezing and then a buck walks by and", "27:33", "you have a 90 pound bow that would be", "27:35", "hard yeah that would be because you're", "27:37", "not warmed up you're not you know active", "27:39", "so that could be difficult but I did use", "27:42", "I had that bow for a late season hunt", "27:46", "back home and it was cold it was like", "27:48", "seven degrees and I've been up there for", "27:49", "hours and I'm just like okay this is", "27:51", "going to be a test now if I come if I", "27:53", "can pull this back and I was able to and", "27:55", "so well it's just because you trained so", "27:57", "hard yeah no I mean yeah if you if you", "27:59", "if I didn't do what I do every day", "28:01", "there's no way that's great I mean how", "28:03", "many other guys are doing that how many", "28:04", "other guys are like in shape and", "28:07", "treating this almost like a sport uh", "28:09", "there's more you know there's there's", "28:11", "more doing it now especially guys out", "28:13", "west but you know I get I get emails", "28:16", "from Georgia from people it just you", "28:20", "know and what I found is it like you", "28:22", "talked about earlier it kind of gives", "28:23", "your life purpose you know everybody has", "28:27", "a job people have families everything", "28:29", "else and and they just kind of they need", "28:32", "to find something that can define them", "28:34", "or motivate them", "28:36", "and now sudden training for hunting is", "28:38", "something you know before that was you", "28:41", "know nobody ever did it so now maybe", "28:43", "that is what's making a difference in", "28:45", "their life and so you know and I still", "28:48", "get people who they don't like it they", "28:51", "they don't like feeling like they have", "28:53", "to train to hunt and so I get criticized", "28:57", "a lot for my approach also and what do", "29:00", "they say what are you doing get in shape", "29:03", "what are you doing good strong healthy", "29:06", "yeah so what kind of criticisms they", "29:09", "come up with you know here though yeah", "29:12", "it's a it's pretty I don't know if it's", "29:15", "funny it's it's been irritating but I", "29:17", "just kind of blow it off but has it", "29:19", "actually irritated you yeah a little bit", "29:20", "you gotta get tougher got away no work", "29:23", "on that aspect new training okay I do", "29:25", "definitely but they'll say stuff like oh", "29:28", "Cameron says you have to be able to run", "29:30", "a marathon to kill an elk right which is", "29:32", "I've never said that I do that but you", "29:35", "don't have to in a or you know I've just", "29:39", "I saw something the other day that says", "29:40", "oh you know my approach is what's wrong", "29:44", "with hunting today say I whoa I didn't", "29:47", "being healthy and strong yes I don't not", "29:50", "eating sugar not drinking alcohol eating", "29:53", "healthy foods and working out yeah", "29:54", "you're what's wrong with the world man", "29:56", "basically yeah", "29:57", "all these healthy fuckers out there", "29:59", "ruining it for everybody else I know all", "30:01", "these fat guys like to sit in tree", "30:02", "stands blow farts they're they're upset", "30:05", "guys like you are out there doing", "30:07", "something exciting I guess I don't know", "30:09", "so anyway yeah I do get I get criticized", "30:11", "just because you know hunting in hunting", "30:14", "for some people is kind of a just to get", "30:16", "away and there's nothing wrong with that", "30:18", "you know you want to it's a vacation", "30:20", "sure it's not something you want to gear", "30:22", "your life around and that's okay I get", "30:24", "that you don't you don't have to train", "30:26", "every day if all you're looking for is", "30:27", "just to get away and relax there's", "30:30", "nothing wrong with that in any endeavor", "30:32", "whether it's a game or a sport or even", "30:35", "martial arts I mean there's nothing", "30:36", "wrong with taking a martial art class", "30:38", "once a week just for exercise you like",

with", "31:02", "something and pursue excellence and it's", "31:05", "okay to just enjoy it as a pastime yeah", "31:07", "the problem is that the people that", "31:08", "enjoy it as a pastime they're always", "31:10", "gonna real get this little nagging thing", "31:14", "in the back of their head for some of", "31:16", "them like especially the weak ones that", "31:18", "they realized that you do it better than", "31:19", "them or they realize that if they went", "31:21", "hunting with you they couldn't keep up", "31:22", "or they realize if they ran with you", "31:24", "they can't keep up or if they realize", "31:25", "they try to live with you they couldn't", "31:26", "lift as much so they're like crabs in a", "31:29", "bucket", "31:30", "you know what crabs in a bucket I like", "31:32",

amongst my enemies I try to", "32:51", "be inspired by people I don't even like", "32:53", "you know I tried like if I find someone", "32:55", "that I think is like someone who's a bad", "32:58",

hills", "66:32", "and be like and he'd be like nothing not", "66:37", "even breathing heavy yeah that that's", "66:39", "what really got me on to this idea of", "66:42", "exercise and hunting being together that", "66:44", "hunting is a difficult thing is that you", "66:46", "carrying this ax yeah", "66:47", "look at the horns on that thing oh my", "66:49", "god those antlers are giant doing lunges", "66:52", "there is that what you're doing now no", "66:54", "just picking it up yeah that's a good", "66:55", "way to do it though right yeah now is", "66:58", "that is there any exercise that you do", "67:00", "specifically to deal with the fact that", "67:02", "you've got so much weight on your back", "67:04", "because when you're packing out like", "67:06", "that and then we talk about the rock", "67:08", "yeah but I mean what I'm saying is to", "67:10", "compensate for that not just doing that", "67:12", "and carrying the rock but is there any", "67:14", "other like do you do like like those", "67:17", "Roman chair exercises or something to", "67:19", "strengthen your lower back because it", "67:21", "seems like like your core and a lot of a", "67:24", "lot of the areas of your back are really", "67:26", "taxed your spine carrying a lot of", "67:29", "weight on you on a pack like that well I", "67:32", "mean I'm working core all all the time", "67:34", "from planks to all the lifts that I do", "67:37", "to shooting a bow is can be core you", "67:40", "know I mean your whole trying to hold", "67:42", "steady you're you're engaging your core", "67:44", "so yeah I do in running the mountain so", "67:48", "whether I have the rock or not I'm", "67:50", "running that mound and when you're on an", "67:51", "uneven trail and you're joking around", "67:53", "and stepping in holes you know you're", "67:56", "engaging your core so and then of course", "67:59", "we do you know different regular lifts", "68:01", "deadlifts and whatever else so I don't", "68:05", "know I try to mix it up yeah I would I", "68:07", "would imagine that there's a lot of", "68:09", "crazy muscle groups involved and not", "68:11", "just carrying that that rock out but", "68:14", "just in shooting that Bo do you balance", "68:17", "out your body because you're pulling so", "68:19", "hard and your rights on do you ever pull", "68:20", "your Bo just with your left side just to", "68:22", "to balance it out now I just I think the", "68:25", "lifting helps that you know I mean", "68:27", "because lifting is pretty much you're", "68:29", "engaging both sides equally so the bow", "68:32", "the bow just is what it is I probably I", "68:34", "probably am a little", "68:36", "balanced but you would build a towel but", "68:38", "just from you know 27 years of doing it", "68:41", "or whatever it's been yeah my friend", "68:44", "Steve Maxwell was a pretty famous", "68:46", "strength and conditioning expert he", "68:48", "works with a lot of people that have", "68:50", "imbalances like tickers in the NFL right", "68:53", "and he gets him the kick of the opposite", "68:55", "side and one of the things that they", "68:56", "found is that when you use your weaker", "69:00", "side um like say if you have a strong", "69:02", "side and they found this with jiu-jitsu", "69:04", "as well it actually enhances your", "69:06", "ability in your strong side hmm so um if", "69:10", "you I find that playing pool to I shoot", "69:13", "pool left-handed sometimes hmm", "69:14", "like if I'm playing my daughter if I'm", "69:16", "playing someone who sucks I'll shoot", "69:17", "pool left-handed and sometimes when", "69:19", "left-handed comes up like there's a shot", "69:21", "that I can't reach right-handed I'll", "69:22", "shoot at left-handed we go and if I", "69:24", "practice left-handed then my right hand", "69:26", "becomes better because I'm concentrating", "69:28", "I have to concentrate so hard use my", "69:30", "left hand cuz it's all like yeah it", "69:32", "doesn't know how to move right oh yeah", "69:34", "Fe yeah it's not thinking right and my", "69:36", "right hand just falls right into place", "69:38", "yeah they say that it using your weak", "69:40", "side actually enhances your strong side", "69:42", "using your your less dominant side yeah", "69:44", "I don't know if I could shoot a bullet I", "69:46", "mean I know you could don't say you", "69:48", "couldn't you could a lot of percent ya", "69:50", "know I'll bet everything I own that you", "69:52", "could shoot a bow left the only", "69:53", "difference in between that is you know", "69:54", "you have your dominant eye yes right so", "69:57", "to shoot left-handed I'd have to use", "69:58", "what isn't my dominant I used my left", "70:01", "eye to aim yeah I don't think that'd be", "70:03", "a problem you know when I started doing", "70:05", "recently the range I started shooting", "70:06", "left-handed because I was shooting so", "70:08", "many rounds with my right that I was", "70:10", "fucking up my right shoulder oh really", "70:12", "the 300 Win Mag oh oh yeah I was", "70:14", "slamming that thing into my shoulder so", "70:16", "many times I was like let me just", "70:17", "fucking shoot a bunch of rounds Lefty", "70:19", "that's why I rifle on is bad because the", "70:22", "the the shock the impacts get a muzzle", "70:24", "break too noisy", "70:25", "it's definitely noisy I got these cool", "70:28", "earphones that you listen to they're", "70:31", "there they cancel the sound out except", "70:35", "talking like a sound of gunshots gets", "70:38", "muffled radically perfect but I could", "70:40", "hear you loud and clear and if you're", "70:42", "talking to me like actually I can hear", "70:44", "you louder than I could with my ears

"different that back decade he's a", "70:55", "different kind of gun night Justin call", "70:59", "it", "70:59", "Justin Martindale is a different kind of", "71:01", "gun nut yeah but he is a gun nut haha", "71:06", "science mm-hmm but um I found that like", "71:10", "shooting lefty like practicing", "71:13", "left-handed it made me like so happy", "71:15", "that I could go back to right-handed", "71:16", "because I was so much better at it", "71:18", "mm-hm you know I think that if you well", "71:20", "you're so good at shooting bow and arrow", "71:21", "anyway but if you did start shooting", "71:24", "left-handed I bet it would make your", "71:25", "right hand better", "71:26", "yeah maybe have you ever thought about", "71:27", "getting Hawaii to make your left hand a", "71:28", "bow I think they'd do it let's do it", "71:30", "let's call Hoyt oh I just want to thank", "71:33", "you and Hoyt for bringing me this", "71:35", "awesome bow Hoyt which is one of the", "71:37", "best bow manufacturers on earth brought", "71:40", "this weight carbon spider turbo for me", "71:43", "and it is amazing we shot a couple shot", "71:46", "we actually have a little bit of a", "71:47", "archery set up back here in the back of", "71:50", "the studio so we shot a couple of", "71:51", "targets with it but this bow is sick", "71:53", "yeah I had one just like it it's amazing", "71:56", "man it's really really awesome feels", "71:58", "great about I brought the factor yeah", "72:01", "yours is 90 pounds mine the one you", "72:03", "brought me is 70 pounds which makes me", "72:05", "feel like a little girl we have to ramp", "72:07", "it up yeah that thing's incredible I was", "72:10", "amazed at how hard that is to pull back", "72:11", "to that's really hard yeah I mean it's", "72:14", "like you know it really is like doing a", "72:16", "90 pound row yeah you know ya know it's", "72:19", "and it's a lot of its technique you know", "72:21", "you want to push at the left pull with", "72:22", "the right but yeah it's got a lot of", "72:24", "power that's uh I built that or had them", "72:26", "build that for me to hunt those uh water", "72:29", "buffalo in Australia and then I'm going", "72:31", "to use it in Africa on Cape Buffalo -", "72:33", "yeah Jamie had that video up Jamie", "72:35", "pulled video up so you could see that a", "72:37", "water buffalo there's a it's a long", "72:39", "stalk a long patience talk on this", "72:42", "Buffalo and I would imagine you would", "72:44", "want to get a bunch of trees between you", "72:46", "and him just in case shit got hairy and", "72:48", "you had a duck behind one of those trees", "72:50", "yeah the thing about this so these", "72:52", "animals here is they catch they catch", "72:56", "movement so if if they're not looking", "72:59", "while you're moving they don't they", "73:01", "can't pick that up so", "73:03", "about going slow and then if he looks of", "73:05", "course I stop so it's just about it's", "73:08", "like right here so I stop because his", "73:10", "heads up and so he can see out of his", "73:12", "eye I'm not moving i puts his head down", "73:14", "and one thing night that i figured out", "73:17", "on these things is they might put their", "73:20", "head down and pretend like they're", "73:21", "eating but really they're looking so you", "73:23", "got to be able to tell he'll have his", "73:25", "head down but if he's not ripping grass", "73:26", "side to side he's not eating he's just", "73:28", "testing me so he might have maybe picked", "73:31", "something up but he put his head down", "73:33", "but his mouth wasn't moving so I just", "73:34", "stopped I'm like okay you're trying to", "73:36", "you're trying to catch me here but as", "73:39", "long as they don't see you move you can", "73:41", "you can walk right up right there and I", "73:44", "get to 40 I'm not sure what we're", "73:46", "filming here but we get to 46 yards and", "73:49", "the crazy thing about this is is I", "73:53", "wanted to let his his leg go forward so", "73:55", "I can slip that arrow in as its legs", "73:58", "forward opening up his vitals and I", "74:01", "waited too long and you can watch this", "74:03", "arrow and it clips a tree in between me", "74:06", "and it and it hit the arrow hit a little", "74:08", "lower than what I wanted because it hit", "74:09", "that tree but because I have you know 90", "74:12", "pounds and so much force it was it", "74:15", "ricocheted caught a little bit of energy", "74:18", "from that tree was lessened but it still", "74:21", "went in and Hart shot on that Buffalo", "74:23", "here it is when shooting it yeah so", "74:25", "watch watch that tree the the curved one", "74:28", "so I want it's late to go forward and", "74:31", "also you barely had barely barely caught", "74:34", "that but if I would had less poundage", "74:37", "that could have so right there it's", "74:40", "that's a hard shot on him and he has no", "74:42", "idea what happened so he's taking off in", "74:45", "their vitals that looks like a bad shot", "74:48", "like if you were hunting out that would", "74:50", "be too forward and too low but on those", "74:52", "that's where the that's where the the", "74:55", "heart is so you have to know basically", "74:57", "right chickens yeah it's a little bit", "74:59", "different on those animals than what", "75:00", "we're here in North America and so you", "75:03", "see he's going to run into a tree here", "75:04", "he's pretty wobbly and so I don't know", "75:07", "how many seconds this was but you got a", "75:09", "2,000 pound animal with the just a", "75:12", "razor-sharp stick and he's down and you", "75:15", "know a minute", "75:16", "maybe min and a half that's that's a lot", "75:19", "quicker than they're ever going to die", "75:20", "in natural habitat on their own no doubt", "75:24", "and that's one thing that people need to", "75:25", "understand when you're talking about", "75:27", "animals and hunting animals in you know", "75:30", "people that are opposed to it they need", "75:32", "to understand first of all that in order", "75:35", "to do proper conservation to take care", "75:37", "of these animals to make sure that their", "75:39", "herds the population is strong you have", "75:41", "to call some of the animals you have to", "75:43", "because otherwise they're going to die", "75:44", "of starvation they're going to you know", "75:45", "they're going to get diseased there's", "75:48", "there's a lot of issues involved if", "75:50", "you're not introducing predators and", "75:52", "then if you introduce predators to take", "75:54", "care of the population well then you got", "75:56", "a whole nother problem obviously and and", "75:59", "they're actually seeing that right now", "76:00", "in parts of this country with with", "76:02", "wolves when they reintroduce wolves I", "76:04", "mean they're they're really ramping up", "76:05", "wolf hunting now in Idaho oh yeah", "76:07", "because the wolves are just tearing up", "76:09", "elk yeah", "76:10", "and it's yeah decimating population yeah", "76:13", "and you know like in Australia there", "76:15", "there's no predators so those Buffalo", "76:18", "there there's too many of them", "76:20", "right now there's no limit on Buffalo", "76:22", "you don't need a tag you don't need a", "76:24", "license they just want them killed", "76:25", "because they're they're not native those", "76:29", "are Asian water buffalo so they were", "76:31", "brought over to Australia though not", "76:32", "native and so there's so many of them", "76:35", "were there once was water and there's", "76:37", "fish and all sorts of things now it's", "76:38", "just basically a mud hole because those", "76:41", "Buffalo get in there and you know they", "76:44", "they piss in there they do live in there", "76:46", "killed everything so they tear up the", "76:50", "habitat they tear up the wall they ruin", "76:53", "the water source and so now there's one", "76:55", "kill so when I was over there I killed", "76:56", "three of those big old things and you", "76:58", "could kill 20 of them if you want they", "77:00", "need them gone Wow", "77:02", "that's the same thing with New Zealand", "77:03", "as well right New Zealand has an issue", "77:05", "with non-native species yeah yeah yeah", "77:07", "that's it you know you know there's only", "77:09", "if I don't know there's tons of", "77:10", "non-native species in Australia I think", "77:13", "let's see the guy was with Adam green", "77:16", "tree he killed it's not a dingo but it's", "77:19", "a sort of like a dingo but it's not a", "77:21", "purebred because those are protected but", "77:23", "uh kangaroo yoked he is yeah it's like", "77:27", "the kangaroo is following the Cameron", "77:28", "Haynes", "77:29", "grandma yeah Adam that's it would not", "77:32", "wanna tangle with that kangaroo man", "77:33", "that's you don't need to be that Jack to", "77:35", "be kangaroo see he's he's wasting his", "77:37", "time he's getting crazy no but uh yeah", "77:42", "so it's it was it was good getting over", "77:44", "there and seeing different animals and", "77:46", "learning from let's see Adam green tree", "77:48", "and Owens run L we're over there and", "77:50", "they've awesome bowhunters and uh you", "77:52", "know get into new countries just what I", "77:54", "love to do yeah and the non-native", "77:56", "species things fascinating thing to me", "77:59", "because that's what we're dealing with", "78:00", "in North America with the wild hogs that", "78:03", "had been introduced you know they were", "78:05", "introduced with the Europeans and", "78:07", "they've run rampant all throughout in", "78:09", "California we were in Tejon ranch or I", "78:12", "went hunting with Rinella and they have", "78:15", "50,000 hogs and this one ranch", "78:17", "I mean it's they're fucking everywhere", "78:19", "yes it's insane yes see these herds of", "78:21", "them oh and they tear they I mean", "78:23", "they're written around tearing up the", "78:24", "ground", "78:25", "yeah and they breed all year round yeah", "78:27", "they're just constantly making babies", "78:29", "and so there's uh there's certain", "78:31", "ranches in California in Southern", "78:33", "California there they're begging people", "78:35", "to come on their ranch and kill hogs you", "78:37", "know in Texas famously they they're", "78:41", "shooting about helicopters yeah I mean", "78:43", "they they actually have companies that", "78:45", "take people on helicopter hog hunts and", "78:48", "that's what they're all about they just", "78:50", "fly around they find the Hogs and", "78:51", "they're shooting them out of the sky and", "78:53", "part of it is novelty and in that you", "78:56", "know you get to hunt from a helicopter", "78:57", "and part of it is necessity oh yeah you", "78:59", "can't get to these damn thing is to", "79:01", "reduce the number somehow yeah not the", "79:03", "non-native species thing is very", "79:05", "fascinating to me and you know just the", "79:08", "the understanding of of population", "79:12", "control is one of the things that I've", "79:14", "really become fascinated by with by", "79:16", "getting into hunting understanding what", "79:17", "the Fish and Wildlife what they have to", "79:19", "go through in order to to figure out", "79:22", "like what how many tags to give out", "79:24", "right what what the numbers are they", "79:26", "need to where they need to let animals", "79:28", "recuperate where they need to go in and", "79:31", "take some of them and reduce them it's a", "79:33", "fascinating thing and one of the most", "79:35", "efficient programs in our country as far", "79:38", "as like you want to talk about like", "79:40", "government programs well Fish and", "79:41", "Wildlife is a government program", "79:43", "but damn it's effective yeah effective", "79:45", "inefficient because it's run by actual", "79:47", "hunters and fishermen and outdoorsmen", "79:49", "yeah no and the thing about you know", "79:52", "hunting people still if you're not a", "79:55", "hunter it's hard to understand or some", "79:57", "people still don't understand why in", "79:59", "this day and age you need to hunt well", "80:00", "you know like I work with the Rocky", "80:02", "Mountain Elk Foundation there's a number", "80:04", "one conservation group out there and", "80:06", "they've they've helped protect habitat I", "80:08", "think over six million acres now of", "80:11", "habitat for elk so that's from hunters", "80:13", "hunters dollars you know conservation", "80:16", "groups so hunters the money we pay for", "80:19", "tag and license and everything else to", "80:22", "use to being out there hunting with the", "80:24", "weapon that's what goes into helping", "80:26", "these animals you know elk numbers now", "80:28", "have never been higher that's yeah we're", "80:30", "hunting them but we're also paying in", "80:34", "contributing to the health and habitat", "80:37", "and for elk and other wildlife and", "80:39", "that's that's what people don't", "80:40", "understand without putting a value on", "80:42", "those animals then that's where I don't", "80:46", "know that's that's where everything goes", "80:47", "sideways but because we value them we're", "80:49", "willing to pay money and help and we got", "80:52", "outfits like the Rocky Mountain out", "80:54", "foundation that just do amazing work for", "80:56", "us yeah I know what we're their mindset", "80:59", "I know I understand where they're coming", "81:01", "from the people that are anti hunting", "81:03", "it's they they're coming from kindness I", "81:06", "mean they don't want you to kill these", "81:08", "cute animals and they don't want you", "81:10", "they feel like it's a cruelty thing more", "81:12", "that it's an evil thing to go out to", "81:15", "nature and find these beautiful things", "81:16", "and shoot them and kill them I", "81:17", "understand the mindset yeah but it like", "81:20", "many things in life is not nearly as cut", "81:23", "and dry as everybody wants to paint it", "81:26", "is everybody wants to depict it it's", "81:27", "it's a far more complex and complicated", "81:30", "issue and they have a hard time", "81:31", "believing that someone could have a deep", "81:33", "love for animals while still hunting", "81:38", "them right no it's a I don't you know I", "81:41", "don't think anybody could respect bow", "81:44", "elk more than I do", "81:45", "you know maybe the same but it's I think", "81:48", "about elk hunting every single day and", "81:50", "those bowls are man once I don't know I", "81:56", "dreamed about", "81:57", "killing a 6x6 bull elk or I first of all", "82:00", "I didn't know if I had what it took I", "82:02", "was like am I good enough or am i tough", "82:05", "enough or can I even do this I mean", "82:07", "maybe I can't maybe I'm not even capable", "82:09", "of it because I I could kill some", "82:10", "animals I could killed a spike boy I", "82:12", "killed some smaller bowls but a 6x6", "82:14", "bull mature herd bull is what every", "82:17", "hunter dreams of and for folks who don't", "82:18", "know what you're saying 6x6 means six", "82:20", "holes and size six points on each side", "82:24", "yeah this is an enormous animal yeah", "82:26", "yeah for folks who don't understand", "82:28", "you're talking about the antlers antlers", "82:30", "that are bigger than my arms yeah longer", "82:33", "and thicker even than my arms okay so I", "82:36", "killed a six by six Bowl this year in", "82:38", "Colorado her in 2013 and

emotion", "148:32", "real real providing yeah and you know", "148:36", "I've had that pitch to me recently about", "148:38", "just showing because just like the the", "148:41", "train not only the training for the hunt", "148:43", "but the camaraderie getting out there", "148:46", "like the challenges I do for my beau", "148:48", "giving back ya know just that is all", "148:51", "part of the story and yeah we're killing", "148:53", "an animal at the end hopefully maybe not", "148:55", "you know cuz a lot of hunts end with no", "148:57", "kill but just the whole journey you know", "149:00", "and it seems like it would make good TV", "149:03", "but Steve shows a lot of hunts that have", "149:06", "no kills I like that I like that he", "149:09", "keeps it real like that I hate that", "149:10", "expression they'll keep it real yeah", "149:12", "other expressions beaten up that is a", "149:14", "beaten up and expression but the you", "149:17", "know having that ethic his you

of elk never", "149:29", "got close enough to get a shot at one", "149:30", "and you know I think that's important", "149:33", "man I think it's it's important to show", "149:35", "people that this is it's called hunting", "149:38", "it's not called shooting right you know", "149:40", "it's it's not here we're gonna shoot", "149:41", "animals today come on watch us", "149:43", "people think the drive out in the truck", "149:45", "and drinking beer or whatever you do and", "149:48", "just see something to shoot at it no", "149:49", "that's that's definitely not my hunting", "149:52", "well that is the problem that the the", "149:56", "public opinion of hunting faces is the", "150:00", "ignorance you know", "150:01", "well Hollywood helps that too does it", "150:03", "yeah I mean just like the scene in", "150:04", "Wolverines I what you mean yeah", "150:06", "right yeah so I mean they're showing", "150:08", "supposedly hunters out there they shoot", "150:11", "this I think it's actually Wolverine as", "150:13", "he was a an animal but shoot him with", "150:16", "the poison pot arrow which I don't even", "150:18", "I've never even seen a poison pot arrow", "150:20", "but so has poison on the arrow shoots", "150:23", "him he turns back into hugh jackman or", "150:26", "whatever and then he goes and he wants", "150:28", "to he's a window are you serious I think", "150:29", "you misread it it was a bear Oh wasn't", "150:32", "he found the bear oh was that one oh", "150:34", "yeah he didn't turn into a bear no well", "150:36", "I thought it was a shit out of", "150:38", "people man okay so how high were you", "150:40", "when you watching this man no I was on a", "150:42", "plane oh so I was probably in and out of", "150:44", "sleep deed but but the point was is they", "150:47", "got this this arrow out of the bear I", "150:50", "guess and he went he found the hunters", "150:52", "they were at the bar and they're", "150:55", "drinking at the bar and he went in there", "150:57", "and you know shoved a the poison arrow", "150:59", "through the leaders hand it's just like", "151:01", "so it's just showing hunters as the bad", "151:03", "people you know what I mean and it's", "151:05", "just like that doesn't help anybody", "151:07", "I've never been to a bar after hunting", "151:10", "and definitely never used poison arrows", "151:12", "it's just like it's perpetuating that", "151:15", "stereotype well yeah and not only that", "151:17", "the way you shoot it the poison won't", "151:18", "even get to them blow right through them", "151:20", "poison being the arrow on the other side", "151:22", "of town Yeah right", "151:23", "no not even an effective way to transmit", "151:25", "poison you know you got to get into the", "151:27", "bloodstream yeah you know when you", "151:28", "shooting a missile through a bear's body", "151:30", "it doesn't work that way yeah that is", "151:33", "you know look these are Hollywood", "151:35", "stereotypes these classic black hat", "151:39", "villains it's just so easy to do it's", "151:41", "just lazy yeah I saw it but so I mean", "151:44", "yeah I think people just have the have", "151:46", "the wrong idea and so having a show that", "151:48", "would show that you know success on ELQ", "151:51", "with a bow is around 10% so it's like", "151:54", "90% of the guys out there pursuing ELQ", "151:56", "with the bow and arrow are failing and", "151:58", "it's it's not guaranteed it is really", "152:01", "tough", "152:01", "showing that struggle and that's why I", "152:04", "mean that's one reason why I trained the", "152:05", "way I do I don't want to be in that 90", "152:07", "percent you know my goal is to be", "152:09", "successful every single year so if you", "152:11", "do what the average guy does you're", "152:13", "going to fail nine times out of 10 if", "152:15", "you do more than average if you do more", "152:19", "than anybody else or the standard then", "152:22", "maybe you'll have more success and so as", "152:24", "it is I kill my bull every single year", "152:28", "and it's just I think it's not because", "152:30", "I'm any better it's because I just work", "152:32", "harder preparing so well you've become", "152:34", "better through hard work right you", "152:36", "become better with knowledge you become", "152:38", "better with training with Fitness with", "152:41", "preparation with arrow shooting you", "152:42", "shoot arrows every day mm-hmm right yeah", "152:44", "yeah so it's just you know and that's", "152:47", "but if people could see how difficult it", "152:49", "really is and see that", "152:51", "like we did film in Australia where we", "152:54", "have no food we have no water is 120", "152:57", "degrees drinking piss drinking piss that", "153:00", "I think you know that would make", "153:02", "compelling TV because they're like wow", "153:05", "this is a lot different than I saw in", "153:08", "the Wolverine movie you know and I don't", "153:11", "know I think I I think it'd be not I", "153:15", "don't know I think it'd be important to", "153:16", "get out there because hunters are the", "153:18", "number one conservationists there are", "153:20", "and sharing that story yeah I I agree", "153:23", "and you know some people find that", "153:25", "contradictory it's like I had a", "153:27", "conversation with someone we were", "153:29", "talking about people and I was saying", "153:31", "well okay if you if you could only you", "153:34", "know if you only hunted like one person", "153:38", "a year but the rest of the people you", "153:40", "made sure you fed them and you took care", "153:42", "of them they got great education and", "153:44", "took care of their environment made sure", "153:46", "the streets are clean would it be okay", "153:48", "to go out and hunt one person right you", "153:50", "know people were like fuck no and so", "153:52", "like when you apply that to animal", "153:56", "hunting it's for a lot of people that's", "153:58", "sort of the same sort of feeling they", "154:01", "have but what they don't understand is", "154:03", "as the apex predator people don't like", "154:05", "to think of as us is the apex predator", "154:06", "especially if you're a vegetarian or if", "154:08", "you're an animal rights lover but", "154:10", "there's a war going on between all", "154:12", "life-forms on this planet we are just so", "154:15", "far ahead of the other animals that we", "154:17", "forgot it's a war and we forgot that we", "154:19", "have these POWs camps in our cities we", "154:21", "call them zoos ok and that's what that", "154:24", "is", "154:24", "those are prisoner of war camps that's", "154:26", "what we dominate this planet and the", "154:28", "reason why you can get out of this", "154:30", "office and go walk down the street and", "154:32", "not worry about getting mauled is", "154:34", "because we paved this motherfucker and", "154:36", "we killed everything that can kill us", "154:37", "and we made sure that anything that", "154:39", "comes in we call the cops and they sent", "154:42", "helicopters and they fucking circle the", "154:44", "area with a flashlight until they find", "154:45", "that cat and then they tranquilize it", "154:48", "and they get it the fuck out of here we", "154:49", "this is our domain and you don't like to", "154:52", "think it's our domain because you don't", "154:53", "have to do any of the work right but the", "154:54", "reality comes into you full force if", "154:57", "you're alone in Idaho with a bow and", "154:59", "arrow and you get circled by a bunch of", "155:01", "howling beasts and they're trying to", "155:03", "take the elk away from you", "155:05", "comes real clear then fuck yeah it does", "155:07", "yeah we are the apex predators whether", "155:10", "you're a predator or not the human", "155:11", "animal is the apex predator and as that", "155:14", "we have to be the stewards of the land", "155:16", "we have to manage this whole situation", "155:19", "and that includes managing predators it", "155:22", "includes managing game animals it", "155:24", "includes the whole kit and caboodle and", "155:26", "that's what hunters are that's what", "155:27", "hunters dollars do is they they put that", "155:31", "hundreds of the grassroots out there", "155:33", "feet on the ground making it happen and", "155:35", "if you don't do that you know what the", "155:36", "other option is you got to pay someone", "155:38", "to go kill these animals which is even", "155:40", "more ridiculous then you have to take", "155:42", "taxpayer money away to go take animals", "155:45", "that are made out of food and you got to", "155:47", "kill them like these are animals that", "155:50", "people could have paid to go kill and", "155:52", "then enjoy the food themselves now you", "155:55", "got to hire like what they're doing the", "155:56", "Hamptons I'm heard about that no New", "155:58", "York mmm they have oh dear massive deer", "156:00", "population so they're hiring snipers", "156:02", "they're trying to figure out what to do", "156:04", "they might spend money on ready for this", "156:06", "strap in birth control for deer you're", "156:10", "talking about spending hundreds of", "156:11", "thousands of dollars to give deer food", "156:14", "with birth control in it to keep them", "156:16", "from breathing they're made out of food", "156:19", "yeah there's plenty people who would", "156:21", "like to go and help them control those", "156:22", "animals and pay to do it well the", "156:24", "problem is that it's an urban area right", "156:25", "and it's become they've let it get so", "156:28", "out of control that the surrounding", "156:31", "areas you know where you would have a", "156:33", "safe area where you can hunt especially", "156:35", "bowhunt you can't do it so it's so crazy", "156:37", "like they're gonna have to hire snipers", "156:39", "thinking that they're gonna have to", "156:40", "figure out a way to I mean you don't", "156:42", "want the hunters roaming around the", "156:44", "Hamptons especially I mean I wouldn't", "156:47", "mind you doing it but you know what I'm", "156:48", "saying like averaged Yahoo yeah the", "156:51", "average dude you know you find out he", "156:52", "can go hunting in the Hamptons and you", "156:54", "know I don't know man I mean I think you", "156:57", "should have to have like a black belt in", "156:58", "hunting to go hunting a Hamptons yeah I", "157:00", "hear you even then I don't

"157:20", "it's that's a that's the reality of the", "157:22", "situation is that we're the ones as the", "157:24", "intelligent creatures that can", "157:26", "communicate we're the ones who have made", "157:28", "an assessment we've made a detailed", "157:31", "analysis of all the different animals", "157:33", "and the numbers and we monitor them on a", "157:35", "yearly basis and folks who don't know", "157:37", "they don't appreciate that I was in the", "157:40", "Hunter when I was young and I didn't", "157:41", "understand hunting and I thought there", "157:43", "was something fucked
