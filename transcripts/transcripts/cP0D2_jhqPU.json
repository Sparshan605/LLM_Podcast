other part of that tribal", "10:01", "dynamic is they start thinking about", "10:03", "themselves and and they're truly lofty", "10:06", "mission which isn't just to sell a", "10:07", "product but something else it's to", "10:09", "protect freedom or if you're a slave", "10:11", "trader it's to rescue the Africans from", "10:14", "terrible lives in Africa and bring them", "10:16", "to the

here because that was that", "10:30", "was the first really intense campaign of", "10:34", "industrial denial I could find the", "10:36", "British dominated the slave trade in the", "10:39", "1700s and the he they faced a very", "10:43", "powerful abolition movement at the end", "10:45", "of that century which was really going", "10:47", "to the public and saying look at how", "10:49", "brutal this is they had witnesses they", "10:52", "had the torture devices they had all", "10:53", "kinds of evidence and the British were", "10:56", "really responding because they even", "10:59", "though they dominated the slave trade", "11:00", "you know they had the", "11:02", "the notion of themselves as civilized", "11:05", "and promoting freedom and being very", "11:07", "humane so this was starting to really", "11:08", "affect the industry so the traders and", "11:10", "the planters got together they formed a", "11:12", "slave Lobby they had a very organized", "11:14", "campaign in response there was a slave", "11:17", "Lobby there was a very powerful slate", "11:19", "Lobby I mean that the thing about the", "11:21", "slave trade was you had people invested", "11:24", "in it from the royal family down to the", "11:27", "local Baker's to many members of", "11:30", "parliament I mean it was a widely", "11:32", "accepted fully legitimate industry so", "11:34", "the the abolitionists really had their", "11:37", "work cut out from for them and they had", "11:40", "all this evidence the industry comes", "11:42", "back and they knew they couldn't just", "11:44", "say oh it's not so brutal they actually", "11:46", "came back with this complete counter", "11:48", "narrative which was we are rescuing", "11:51", "these people that that they're the", "11:53", "Africans are eager to be purchased do", "11:56", "they actually try to market themselves", "11:57", "as how fit they are for for work they", "12:01", "enjoy that crossing across the Atlantic", "12:03", "there was singing dancing games of", "12:06", "chance and when they get to the", "12:08", "plantations it is incredibly comfortable", "12:10", "they get comfy little houses it's like a", "12:13", "cradle to grave welfare state they don't", "12:16", "have to worry if they get sick we take", "12:18", "care of them we feed them and they're", "12:21", "doing way better than those poor", "12:23", "peasants back there in Britain are those", "12:25", "poor miners or those people working in", "12:27", "the new factories so that was that was", "12:31", "part of it and then the next part of it", "12:32", "was that they they said that if they had", "12:35", "left them in Africa if you didn't", "12:37", "continue this trade all of these", "12:39", "prisoners of war would be massacred or", "12:42", "they would be eaten by cannibals or they", "12:45", "would die of famine so they were this", "12:48", "was a rescue narrative and here's the", "12:49", "really clever part of this because if", "12:51", "you believe that you are rescuing them", "12:54", "or and if you persuade other people and", "12:56", "not suggesting the industry believe this", "12:57", "but if you can persuade people that you", "12:59", "are rescuing them the flip side of it is", "13:02", "that abolition would doom them you would", "13:06", "be shutting the gates of mercy on", "13:08", "mankind", "13:09", "because as one one trader put it the the", "13:12", "house of bondage is really", "13:15", "the house of freedom to them I may have", "13:18", "misspoken that a little bit but it was a", "13:19", "truly Orwellian quote and and and so", "13:23", "that way you you translate abolition", "13:26", "into in humanity into brutality and and", "13:30", "you portray the continued slave trade as", "13:33", "a way to save these people oh one one", "13:35", "quote was great that if you were to free", "13:37", "the slaves and and by the way at this", "13:39", "point they weren't actually talking", "13:40", "about freeing the existing slaves just", "13:42", "stopping the flow of new slaves but one", "13:45", "of the quotes was that freeing the", "13:47", "slaves would be cramming Liberty down", "13:49", "the throats of people incapable of", "13:52", "digesting it Wow yeah so this was the", "13:56", "first example that you found of industry", "13:59", "that was working to try to distort the", "14:03", "perceptions of reality so that they can", "14:05", "continue what they're doing right and", "14:07", "you know they did a lot of other things", "14:09", "that we've seen modern industries doing", "14:12", "they they you know I mentioned the", "14:14", "reference to the poor peasants and and", "14:17", "they also talked about you know how", "14:19", "would you like it", "14:20", "Britain if if people came in and started", "14:23", "telling the peasants and the soldiers", "14:25", "and the sailors that they had rights you", "14:27", "know so basically this kind of you know", "14:30", "help us or you are next your whole glass", "14:32", "structure is going to collapse that kind", "14:33", "of an argument and then they had an", "14:36", "argument about basically failing to make", "14:39", "a distinction between their industry and", "14:41", "their interests in the whole country or", "14:43", "rather you know kind of an early version", "14:45", "of what's good for the country is good", "14:47", "for GM and vice-versa they said if you", "14:50", "abolish this trade it means Universal", "14:52", "bankruptcy for the kingdom it means", "14:54", "Britain is not powerful anymore it means", "14:56", "Britain becomes a province of France it", "15:00", "means in the sugar islands that the", "15:02", "slaves will Massacre thee the whites", "15:05", "exterminate the whites and or maybe make", "15:07", "the white slaves so they basically you", "15:11", "know just created this incredible", "15:12", "slippery slope that every that any kind", "15:14", "of reform or certainly abolition of this", "15:16", "industry would be disastrous for the", "15:18", "entire kingdom", "15:19", "so how well-documented is this in terms", "15:21", "of like the influencers like who who", "15:23", "started this like and is it was there", "15:26", "like open discussions about", "15:28", "how to spin this in a way that it's", "15:31", "gonna get people to think that slavery", "15:32", "is a good thing well I don't know about", "15:34", "internal discussions within the industry", "15:36", "what we do have are lots and lots of", "15:39", "books and pamphlets because this was all", "15:41",

and so we have some version of what", "15:52", "was actually said in these debates and", "15:53", "various hearings there were", "15:55", "parliamentary hearings so there's", "15:56", "actually quite a lot of evidence of the", "15:59", "arguments being made in their own words", "16:02", "so and then this was primarily in", "16:06", "Britain right right this is well that's", "16:08", "what I'm talking about here obviously", "16:09", "there was the we had our own abolition", "16:11", "movement here right that's what I was", "16:13", "gonna ask you did those same arguments", "16:15", "did they actually get presented in the", "16:18", "United States some of them did in the", "16:20", "United States it was different because", "16:22", "of course you had an entire society", "16:24",

little scary and then of course", "27:59", "they became very powerful and in the", "28:00", "1800's you end up with the Gilded Age", "28:02", "and and so then you have folks like", "28:05", "Teddy

and", "29:42", "some industry races in there and takes", "29:45", "advantage of it I mean even slavery the", "29:47", "discovery would have been the new world", "29:48", "and this enormous commercial

"30:24", "in almost all of these chapters you get", "30:27", "to some sort of form of government", "30:28", "action where they say no you can't do", "30:31", "that anymore we we stop this industry we", "30:33", "ban this product or at least we're gonna", "30:35", "try to tweak your behavior but that", "30:39", "process first of all it takes a long", "30:41", "long time an enormous damage can be

it", "30:55", "determines whether it gets regulated or", "30:58", "not and it blocks those regulations well", "31:00", "that's what I was getting to is because", "31:02", "that", "31:02", "kind of

"31:43", "not a new thing when they do it through", "31:44", "money right that's that's pretty", "31:46", "well-established but but yeah I mean you", "31:49", "know somebody probably not me because I", "31:53", "don't know this this industry well", "31:56", "enough but but the pattern is so clear", "31:59", "that that it's clear where where we're", "32:01", "heading right I mean the problems will", "32:03", "get worse and worse other people will", "32:04", "talk about them the problems are very", "32:06", "new I think because we are talking about", "32:08", "problems related to

the oil industry which played a", "32:42", "huge role in in building it up has", "32:45", "basically set up we we accept the", "32:48", "climate science we know this is", "32:49", "happening in fact you know Exxon Mobil", "32:51", "even says it accepts the Paris agreement", "32:54", "which says that we have to limit warming", "32:57", "to well below two degrees centigrade and", "33:00", "that

"33:17", "degrees we're talking about cutting our", "33:20", "emissions by 50 percent that means", "33:22", "pretty much in cutting 50 percent of our", "33:27", "of our fossil fuel use no that's a", "33:30", "simplification but then you have to go", "33:32", "for that more aggressive target to zero", "33:34", "net to zero emissions by 2050 so we're", "33:38", "talking essentially about this huge", "33:40", "industry having to either completely", "33:44", "transform itself or go away within 30", "33:47", "years and then by the way after that you", "33:49", "have to go into negative

that's assumed what we're", "34:00", "gonna have to do because we have now", "34:02", "delayed for 30 years thanks in large", "34:05", "part to fossil fuel denial so so you've", "34:08", "got Exxon saying yeah yeah we we", "34:09", "understand Paris and all that but if you", "34:12", "if you look at their own projections", "34:14", "about what they think is going to happen", "34:17", "they put out these formal projections of", "34:19", "how much oil will be consumed in the", "34:20", "whole world and what our emissions are", "34:22", "going to be they still project emissions", "34:23",

don't think it's", "43:43", "gonna go away I think but other issues", "43:46", "do come to the forefront but what you", "43:48", "said I think is really interesting is", "43:49", "that it gives you

"45:21", "wrenches into the gears it's throw easy", "45:23", "so to throw sand into the gas tank it's", "45:25", "so easy to sort of monkey with the the", "45:28", "numbers and change the ideas that are", "45:30", "being discussed and changed the", "45:32", "narratives that it's a it's a it's a", "45:35", "turn it's a just a way that you can sort", "45:37", "of shift the public's interests and",

"45:49", "tendency that when we talk to people we", "45:52", "already agree with we tend to then", "45:54", "become stronger in our opinions and so", "45:56", "we we get polarized basically and that's", "45:59", "even before social media so then you", "46:01", "sort of weaponize that polarization that", "46:04", "tendency and and you've got an algorithm", "46:06", "that says well if you like that video", "46:08", "how about this video and suddenly people", "46:10", "are getting you know totally radicalized", "46:12", "you know on on climate change or on", "46:15", "other issues and so yeah I mean it is it", "46:18", "is a huge problem how do we overcome the", "46:21", "social divisions the social distrust how", "46:24", "do we overcome the denial and you know I", "46:28", "think if the patterns in in the book", "46:31", "come to the fore we will society will", "46:33", "find ways to", "46:34", "build trust again it'll probably have a", "46:36", "lot to do with maintaining

will be", "46:56", "it's yeah it seems like there has to be", "46:59", "because if you I can't imagine I'm not", "47:02", "naive enough to imagine that what's", "47:03", "happening with the internet research", "47:04", "agencies in Russia it's not happening", "47:06", "here it has to be and they understand", "47:08", "the effectiveness of it it's been well", "47:10", "documented the idea that corporations", "47:12", "are gonna step back and go well that's", "47:14", "not our business that's not what we do I", "47:16", "mean that's an incredibly effective tool", "47:18", "and if you were gonna use it to", "47:20", "manipulate opinions on whether its", "47:22", "climate change or you know anything you", "47:25", "don't pharmaceutical drug overdoses like", "47:27", "whatever whatever it is that you want to", "47:29", "manipulate people with I would imagine", "47:31", "that that's a gigantic issue but it's", "47:34", "not something that really gets discussed", "47:36", "in terms of in terms of passing", "47:39", "legislation to prevent that stuff yeah", "47:41", "and and hopefully it gets more and more", "47:44", "discussed because it is very scary I", "47:46", "mean right it turns out we humans are", "47:49", "easily manipulated and were easily", "47:51", "manipulated even before social media but", "47:53", "now there is this incredibly", "47:55", "sophisticated engine to drive us apart", "47:57", "to drive us in the direction that those", "48:01", "best at manipulating us want us to be", "48:03", "yes and it's addictive which is even", "48:06", "crazier it's a completely addictive", "48:09", "mechanism really yes people are lost in", "48:12", "their phones and lost in their computers", "48:14", "like when they're checking their social", "48:16", "media stuff and that's one of the more", "48:19", "interesting things about these social", "48:20", "media algorithms that it's been", "48:23", "determined that when people are upset", "48:26", "about things and when

abortion a hot topic or", "48:38", "environmental issues they'll start", "48:40", "sending you those that's what's going to", "48:42", "show up in your feet you're gonna get", "48:43", "more because this is what you engage in", "48:45", "and it's what's fascinating is", "48:48", "it's not even really malicious in that", "48:52", "it's just pragmatic because I have a", "48:54", "friend who did an experiment", "48:56", "my friend Ari wanted to find out what", "48:59", "would happen if he just looked up", "49:00", "puppies so he just looked up puppies on", "49:04", "YouTube and looked up puppies everywhere", "49:06", "and his feed was overwhelmed by puppies", "49:08", "so it's not like this some vicious plot", "49:11", "to only feed you things that you hate", "49:14", "just human nature we tend to look at", "49:17", "things that piss us off it was generally", "49:20", "kind of crazy and so now we have a very", "49:22", "sophisticated machine to drive us in the", "49:25", "direction of getting more pissed off and", "49:27", "that sophisticated machine is clearly", "49:30", "using the same sort of deceptive", "49:32", "deceptive tactics to try to diminish", "49:35", "their responsibility for what they're", "49:37", "doing yeah exactly and you know one of", "49:41", "the things that makes these tactics I", "49:43", "think work so well is that they really", "49:44", "are based in human nature I mean I think", "49:47", "that if you are an executive you know", "49:50", "your instinct is that you are doing fine", "49:53", "and your instinct is that the other side", "49:56", "is wrong in that and that psychological", "49:58", "reflex then you know becomes a", "50:00", "foundation for a corporate strategy and", "50:02", "then that corporate strategy becomes the", "50:04", "basis of kind of its own new industry of", "50:06", "public relations folks and advertising", "50:09", "people and lawyers and and think tanks", "50:11", "who will promote that and then that", "50:13", "becomes an ideology that's certainly", "50:16", "what we saw the progression for climate", "50:18", "change and I and I think our climate", "50:20", "denial and that's a dangerous

not a factor I", "50:34", "mean the more the most recent industry", "50:36", "that I talked about the two most recent", "50:37", "industries are the fossil fuels denying", "50:39", "climate change and also Wall Street", "50:41", "denying the the products and activities", "50:46", "and and hazards that led up to the", "50:49", "financial crisis of 2008 that's a can of", "50:52", "worms in and of

where you can say look we've got a", "62:05", "clear path you don't have to raise money", "62:06", "anymore well there is there ways to what", "62:09", "away at this and and you know didn't", "62:10",

was a very", "68:58", "efficiently what form was the radium in", "69:00", "they would put it well they've somehow", "69:02", "would refine it and distill it until you", "69:04", "know tiny tiny little

what they did in the u.s. we try to", "69:34", "do that but the industry there was a", "69:36", "brand new industry that was just forming", "69:38", "and they step forward the first company", "69:42",

told", "70:28", "Congress to cure cancer he had good", "70:31", "motive but he also wanted a big market", "70:33", "right cancer you know just one disease", "70:36", "and if you reuse the radium that's not a", "70:38", "market so he was determined to expand", "70:40", "that market he actually opened what what", "70:43", "was called the first free radium clinic", "70:46", "in the world in 1913

was", "76:18", "it measurable", "76:19", "yeah Oh even even by the standards of", "76:22", "the time now now one thing about the", "76:24", "radium industry is it you know denials", "76:26", "like that blaming the victim are", "76:27", "appalling but one of the things we did", "76:30", "see is that the leaders of that industry", "76:32", "including the guy who invented that", "76:33",

this", "77:02", "radioactive waste right so he hired a", "77:04", "botanist to find out if it could be a", "77:06", "fertilizer and then they published a", "77:09", "report that you should yeah spread", "77:10", "radioactive waste on your food crops", "77:12", "because it's great", "77:15", "he actually had him spread waste on his", "77:17", "own garden and then six years later", "77:19",

had", "77:42", "anemia and and if he believed", "77:45", "his own clinic his own his own sales", "77:48", "pitch he probably drank more rhenium to", "77:50", "treat his Renea so so he did die so so", "77:53", "in these two characters at least we have", "77:55", "people believing what they said enough", "77:57", "to actually kill themselves as well as", "78:00", "other people so it seems again that this", "78:02", "is there's this human characteristic", "78:03", "that this this tendency we start making", "78:06", "money you start justifying you want to", "78:08", "keep that money coming in so

and", "79:29", "Joseph Flannery was hailed as a", "79:31", "visionary and he did you know he was", "79:33", "bold he was inventive he worked hard he", "79:35", "built a business he just didn't ask

be a huge issue and I", "84:07", "think people certainly smarter than me", "84:09", "who understand this industry better are", "84:11", "gonna have to pick it apart and try to", "84:12", "think about how we really do directly", "84:15", "address these problems we obviously", "84:17", "didn't evolve with social media in mind", "84:20", "and our brains you know being highly", "84:25", "social

people to", "84:43", "deal with what we're seeing it so", "84:45", "clearly right now because it's being", "84:47", "exacerbated by social distancing the", "84:50", "fact that we're not around each

right it's not illegal", "85:49", "and it will take a long time before we", "85:51", "get those in place and well and also but", "85:53", "it might be too late you know before we", "85:55", "recognize

that takes place mean they're", "86:04", "already manipulating things in some", "86:06", "really weird ways if they start having", "86:09", "their own money on top of that and then", "86:11", "they can manipulate their own individual", "86:13", "economy like what what does that look", "86:15", "like I mean no one even considered no", "86:19", "one considered cryptocurrency twenty", "86:20",

you compare that to much", "87:05", "older science fiction that that has a", "87:07", "much more positive perspective often not", "87:10", "always but at least there was often", "87:12", "something that was positive although I", "87:14", "have to say a lot of that is stuff that", "87:16", "was actually put together by", "87:17", "corporations who were showing you the", "87:18", "home of the

how that story it", "88:21", "does seem to have been forgotten", "88:22", "oh the threat and the fact of the", "88:26", "success I mean we caused this huge", "88:29", "problem", "88:30", "we discovered this huge problem which we", "88:33", "need I mean that was kind of", "88:35", "serendipitous", "88:36", "and yes the industry denied it and and", "88:39", "it's kind of came in two chapters first", "88:41", "it was the aerosol industry saying this", "88:44", "is an attack on free enterprise probably", "88:46", "the KGB is behind it I mean what else", "88:48", "there was one aerosol company president", "88:51", "Yahoo suspected it was a KGB but", "88:53", "but many industry leaders were talking", "88:56", "about this being as you know an", "88:57", "anti-capitalist crusade and partly", "89:00", "because this was the early 70s so they", "89:01", "had already faced all of these you know", "89:04", "demanding environmentalists saying take", "89:06", "the lid out of the gasoline and do all", "89:08", "kinds of other things and so they were", "89:11", "starting to feel like attacked on all", "89:12", "sides and and eventually you know so", "89:15", "there was some denial there mostly", "89:17", "political eventually that got handled", "89:20", "well I shouldn't say eventually he got", "89:21", "handled relatively quickly because", "89:23", "actually it's like 1976 when they said", "89:26", "okay we're getting this stuff out of the", "89:28", "hairspray out of the deodorant we don't", "89:29", "need this in spray cans what was it that", "89:31", "was in the spring chlorofluorocarbons", "89:33", "CFCs which were invented ironically by", "89:38", "the same guy who invented leaded", "89:40", "gasoline at GM oh boy invented both of", "89:43", "these what second name his name was", "89:46", "Thomas Midgley yeah and he left quite a", "89:49", "mark on the world but but here's the", "89:52", "thing I mean I blame him for putting", "89:54", "lead in gasoline that was terrible but", "89:56", "inventing CFCs was actually done because", "89:59", "it was replacing the poisonous gases", "90:01", "that were then in refrigerators and they", "90:05", "would sometimes leak and kill people so", "90:07", "people were just transitioning now from", "90:10", "ice boxes to fridges and and so they", "90:12", "needed a non-toxic gas to put in there", "90:14", "so he came up with this and it was", "90:15", "non-toxic and so you know at the time", "90:17", "nobody really even knew much about the", "90:20", "ozone layer and they certainly didn't", "90:21", "know CFCs were gonna wreck it so it's", "90:23", "much much less obvious risk and and then", "90:26", "it wasn't in until the 70s then", "90:28", "scientists who were just sort of curious", "90:31", "put this all together and realized oh we", "90:33", "are wrecking the ozone layer and by 76 I", "90:36", "think it was 76 the Ford administration", "90:39", "said okay we're getting it out of the", "90:41", "cans he got a couple years and this", "90:43", "industry the aerosol industry who had", "90:45", "been screaming and yelling about", "90:47", "anti-capitalists said okay I mean it", "90:51", "wasn't it was not that big a deal was", "90:52", "easy for them to do and then then I", "90:55", "guess we were in the Carter", "90:56", "Administration and they were gonna start", "90:57", "looking at the harder problem of how do", "90:59", "you replace CFCs in refrigerators and", "91:01", "air conditioners and they were putting", "91:04", "up a plan for that but then Reagan got", "91:06", "elected and", "91:07", "and the concerns of the 60s and 70s", "91:09", "about how do we protect the environment", "91:12", "were replaced by concerns about how do", "91:15", "we avoid environmental regulations", "91:18", "because they were they felt it was", "91:20", "hurting business and so they basically", "91:23", "dropped the ball on this completely and", "91:25", "and the corporations like you can't", "91:27", "which was the top CFC maker they had", "91:30", "been working on substitutes but once the", "91:32", "the pressure of regulation went away", "91:35", "they just dropped it they didn't keep", "91:37", "looking for substitutes even though they", "91:38", "had the the same science telling them", "91:41", "that there was a risk here but they", "91:42", "decided that we're not gonna have to", "91:44", "worry about it then eventually the ozone", "91:46", "hole is discovered and scientists are", "91:48", "shocked because the models had predicted", "91:50", "you know a gradual reduction in ozone", "91:54", "and suddenly you've got this deep", "91:56", "production in ozone and it covers like", "91:57", "you know this huge space over Antarctica", "92:00", "one of the reasons NASA had not", "92:02", "discovered this with their satellites", "92:04", "was that they were expecting so much", "92:06", "less that they had apparently programmed", "92:10", "the computers to read huge readings like", "92:13", "this as instrument error Wow so it was", "92:17", "actually the British who discovered this", "92:18", "they they did it the old-fashioned way", "92:20", "going down to Antarctica and like", "92:22", "measuring things so anyway they", "92:25", "announced it the NASA looked back and", "92:26", "said whoops you're right", "92:27", "huge ozone hole then everything kind of", "92:29", "accelerated and by 87 we had the", "92:32", "Montreal Protocol and even though Reagan", "92:34", "had run on this anti-regulatory platform", "92:37", "he signed the Montreal Protocol Senate", "92:40", "ratified it I don't think there were any", "92:41", "dissenting votes so you know that was a", "92:45", "big success story and by the way by the",

"92:54", "the one example I can point to where", "92:56", "science and evidence overcame denial but", "93:00", "it's an example where the product wasn't", "93:03", "their core product it was a little", "93:05", "sliver of revenue that wasn't that", "93:06", "lucrative they could replace it was", "93:08", "something that they could sell and they", "93:11", "were going to clearly get regulated", "93:12", "anyway so so clearly the you know the", "93:14", "benefits of continued denial had sort of", "93:16", "disappeared and", "93:18", "so you can't count on evidence you know", "93:21", "leading to the end of corporate denial", "93:23", "more typically you have a situation like", "93:25", "tobacco and fossil fuels where even if", "93:30", "it does lead to denial it doesn't they", "93:32", "don't stop selling the product right so", "93:35", "and again obviously oil companies can't", "93:38", "just stop selling their product but they", "93:39", "can be part of a process for us all to", "93:42", "figure out how we're going to replace it", "93:43", "as quickly as possible what what efforts", "93:45", "were done if any to regenerate ozone", "93:48", "just to cut the emissions and it's not", "93:51", "aware of anything I don't know that yeah", "93:54", "it's funny I'm not heard anybody talk", "93:55", "about that but it we've always known", "93:58", "that the CFCs take decades to get up to", "94:00", "the atmosphere so stopping emissions", "94:03", "meant that the old stuff was still going", "94:05", "up there and it was only taking decades", "94:07", "to fix it we do seem to have signs of", "94:09", "healing now of the ozone layer so it", "94:10", "does seem like we have solved well solve", "94:13", "this we have we have stopped the harm", "94:15", "and it's going to get better through", "94:16", "natural circumstances but you know I was", "94:19", "I was talking about how people don't let", "94:21", "us celebrate that as humanity at its", "94:23", "best you know because we really did", "94:26", "something very hard or it's in the sense", "94:28", "of figuring out the science getting the", "94:30", "nations of the world together", "94:31", "and getting rid of a product that had", "94:33", "been really useful and valuable to us", "94:35", "but what happened immediately after that", "94:38", "was this political backlash even when", "94:42", "you had the chemical industry saying yep", "94:44", "we're destroying the ozone layer we're", "94:46", "gonna stop doing that you had these", "94:49", "right-wing groups Fred singer actually", "94:51", "was one of the witnesses who was also in", "94:53", "merchants of doubt' who goes and and he", "94:57", "gets to testify before Congress he's a", "94:59", "scientist and he's saying that the", "95:01", "mainstream science on which you have", "95:03", "just based all of these decisions you're", "95:06", "being bamboozled and they have an", "95:09", "anti-capitalist agenda and you had then", "95:13", "I think it was Tom DeLay saying he", "95:16", "doesn't listen to the ozone trends panel", "95:18", "all of those you know hundreds of", "95:19", "scientists who have hammered out the", "95:21", "data on these issues he listens to Fred", "95:23", "singer and that was sort of the", "95:25", "beginning well not the beginning because", "95:26", "you couldn't take it back to the 80s but", "95:28", "that was the next step in the rise of", "95:31", "the", "95:31", "science deniers who sort of had this", "95:33", "all-purpose agenda that looked at lots", "95:35", "of different industries and the funny", "95:37", "thing was here you know you had the", "95:40", "industry saying you know we're fine with", "95:44", "this accelerating the phase-out we're", "95:47", "gonna go ahead and do it so you know the", "95:49", "way I think about it is that industry", "95:51", "for a long time", "95:53", "fueled out and to some extent they also", "95:56", "then funded groups with an ideological", "95:58", "agenda who continued to push that doubt", "96:01", "and then some of those industries", "96:03", "stopped denying the science maybe", "96:06", "because they were going to get sued or", "96:07", "maybe because it was just time but the", "96:10", "groups that they have funded now sort of", "96:13", "outflank them on the issue and for", "96:14", "example Exxon used to fund Exxon Mobil", "96:18", "used to fund this little crazy little", "96:21", "group called the Heartland Institute and", "96:24", "they stopped doing that quite a long", "96:27", "time ago this Institute kept just", "96:28", "getting more and more extreme on this", "96:30", "issue and recently they had a dispute", "96:33", "between Exxon Mobil and Heartland", "96:34", "Institute and Heartland leader called", "96:36", "Exxon Mobil part of the anti energy", "96:39", "global warming movement that's hilarious", "96:41", "yeah so you know they're things are", "96:45", "weird right now that's super weird", "96:48", "calling super weird Exxon part of an", "96:50", "anti energy global warming movement", "96:53", "movement now it's possible that this was", "96:55", "all kind of staged to make Exxon look", "96:57", "good but I think they have just created", "97:00", "a monster and that monster is going to", "97:02", "keep going around out there and it keeps", "97:04", "getting a lot of money the problem is it", "97:06", "doesn't we don't necessarily know who's", "97:07", "funding these groups anymore for a long", "97:10", "time Exxon funded a lot of climate", "97:12", "denier groups they got a lot of public", "97:14", "pushback and pressure they stopped", "97:16", "funding the most extreme ones not all of", "97:18", "them then the Koch brothers started", "97:20", "funding their foundation started funding", "97:22", "a lot of these groups they got a lot of", "97:25", "attention then we saw a lot of the", "97:27", "funding of these groups going", "97:28", "underground into these dark money", "97:31", "organizations like donors trust that", "97:33", "promise anonymity so that if you want to", "97:35", "fund a politically sensitive issue", "97:38", "nobody knows you've done it so these you", "97:42", "know the more extreme groups get a lot", "97:44", "of money from", "97:45", "these dark money organizations and", "97:47", "therefore there's even deeper anonymity", "97:50", "and and no accountability that's some 4d", "97:53", "chess if Exxon was doing that if they're", "97:55", "sitting there going look I know we got", "97:58", "someone to call us a bunch of hippies", "98:00", "yeah I suspect that it wasn't that I", "98:04", "think they really have just created a", "98:06", "monster here really would be brilliant", "98:07", "if it was true well I think that some of", "98:10", "this is true that you I mean here's the", "98:12", "thing if you're Exxon and you don't", "98:14", "actually want to do anything you you", "98:17", "spin off the denial into other groups", "98:18", "that will actually stop things I mean", "98:20", "this little group Heartland I mean the", "98:22", "this extreme edge of these advocacy", "98:25", "groups they're deeply involved in the", "98:28", "Trump administration I mean they it's", "98:29", "not like they're just out there howling", "98:31", "in the wilderness they have had an", "98:32", "enormous influence so if you can back", "98:36", "off like like Exxon especially", "98:38", "ExxonMobil especially if you're being", "98:39", "sued and you've got angry shareholders", "98:42", "and you've got the SEC you had a lot of", "98:45", "reasons and and you have angry European", "98:47", "countries that are taking this more", "98:48", "seriously in your multinational you have", "98:50", "a lot of reason to kind of keep your", "98:52", "mouth shut and maybe say the right", "98:53", "things but you can indeed still benefit", "98:57", "from the denial you have spun off into", "98:59", "the world that is in fact say rolling", "99:03", "back the fuel efficiency standards I", "99:04", "don't know what Exxon Mobil has said", "99:06", "about that but clearly the more", "99:08", "inefficient our cars the more oil gets", "99:10", "burned are their tactics and is there", "99:14", "like a school of thought that goes along", "99:15", "with this these sort of strategies like", "99:17", "is this taught in universities because", "99:20", "they're places where they learn this", "99:21", "stuff because you would think that it's", "99:22", "very valuable and it's often very", "99:25", "sophisticated I mean to actually", "99:26", "manipulate and deny", "99:28", "is this something that gets taught once", "99:30", "they get into this corporation is an", "99:32", "internal thing or is it is it just a", "99:34", "natural factor in the way human beings", "99:38", "react to the profitability and denial of", "99:41", "responsibility I think it certainly", "99:43", "starts there with it being a natural", "99:45", "reaction but I think then what happens", "99:47", "as industries learn from the previous", "99:48", "industry tobacco taught everybody how to", "99:52", "do this certainly everybody in the", "99:54", "modern era and then of course you do", "99:56", "have this this industry of groups that", "99:59", "of multiple industries so if you can be", "100:03", "a group that sets up front groups and I", "100:06", "quote one here the man named Rick Berman", "100:08", "who has a company that sets up front", "100:11", "groups for industries that are facing", "100:12", "regulation and he promises them complete", "100:15", "anonymity and the irony here is that he", "100:17", "was he was talking to a group of oil and", "100:19", "gas executives and saying hey we can", "100:21", "give you complete anonymity and some", "100:22", "were saying things like well you know", "100:24", "you're telling us we should really be", "100:25", "attacking people's character and", "100:27", "reducing the credibility and I'm not so", "100:29", "sure I like that and he says hey you can", "100:31", "either party phrase it lose pretty or", "100:35", "win ugly and said I will give you", "100:37", "complete anonymity people have no idea", "100:39", "who's paying me and then somebody in the", "100:43", "audience anonymously leaked the whole", "100:46", "tape to the New York Times and and so", "100:48", "you can see the all of the text and and", "100:51", "he you know he was talking about the", "100:53", "various strategies and one of the things", "100:55", "that he explicitly said although it was", "100:57", "pretty obvious already from the tobacco", "100:59", "history was that you do not need to", "101:03", "convince people you are right when it", "101:05", "comes to science denial all you need to", "101:08", "do is raise doubt because in order to do", "101:11", "something we need to reach a certain", "101:12", "level of certainty we need momentum and", "101:15", "it is actually really easy to to minute", "101:19", "to diminish that by raising doubt that's", "101:21", "certainly something the fossil fuel", "101:23", "industry has done with respect to", "101:25", "climate and and what he said was doubt", "101:27", "paralyzes people they think I don't know", "101:29", "who's right they think I'll just wait", "101:31", "and then basically you have sort of a", "101:34", "tie in their minds but you win every", "101:37", "time oh so that kind of a strategy", "101:42", "that's you know it's pretty", "101:43", "sophisticated in the sense that it was", "101:47", "an insight that that really helps lots", "101:50", "of industries with science denial but it", "101:53", "was also a pretty obvious lesson from", "101:55", "watching the tobacco industry but but", "101:58", "really nobody has put it to use the way", "102:00", "the fossil fuel industry has done around", "102:02", "climate change so there isn't a sense of", "102:04", "playbook there's a playbook and there's", "102:06", "an industry that will help you run those", "102:08", "plays and also keep you hidden while", "102:10", "you're running those plays so you don't", "102:12", "have to", "102:12", "visible to your shareholders to your", "102:16", "consumers to politicians if this was an", "102:19", "operating system we would abandon it and", "102:22", "bring a new one right if this was", "102:24", "Windows 95 or something we might be", "102:28", "better able to predict how it will crash", "102:30", "us yes yeah yeah but it seems like the", "102:34", "operating system of whether it's", "102:35", "economics or politics never really gets", "102:38", "updated it just sort of gets patched", "102:41", "yeah unfortunately this is an operating", "102:43", "system that takes on a life of its own", "102:45", "and has its own desire to perpetuate", "102:47", "itself maybe this is where the you know", "102:50", "the future of all operating system yeah", "102:52", "I mean you know if you think about sort", "102:54", "of again back to the comic books back to", "102:57", "the novels back to Frankenstein our", "103:00", "creations tend to want to live and they", "103:03", "tend to want to turn on us and", "103:05", "corporations are our creation yes yeah", "103:09", "how did you choose which ones to cover", "103:12", "and were there any subjects that you", "103:14", "left out they didn't yeah well yeah I", "103:18", "was I was pretty conscious about it", "103:20", "eventually I mean I stumbled around a", "103:22", "long time and looked at a lot of", "103:23", "industries but I wanted first of all in", "103:26", "in industries where there was a lot of", "103:28", "evidence so it was clear that this isn't", "103:30", "just reasonable doubt this isn't just", "103:32", "people trying to figure it out this", "103:34", "there there was something going on here", "103:36", "that I could call denial I also ended up", "103:39", "with industries that had an enormous", "103:42", "impact because there were just so many", "103:43", "of them and in fact all of the chapters", "103:46", "deal with hurting millions of people or", "103:49", "threatening catastrophic global harm", "103:52", "like ozone depletion or climate change", "103:54", "with in fact the exception of radium", "103:56", "which I think we can probably say only", "103:57", "hurt thousands of people so those were", "104:00", "the first two factors and and because I", "104:03", "was looking at this as a social", "104:04", "phenomenon I didn't want cases where a", "104:08", "company was just keeping a secret and it", "104:09", "got discovered I wanted cases where", "104:11", "there was a sustained campaign of denial", "104:14", "over time which of course gave me lots", "104:16", "of source material to look at but also", "104:19", "because that changes the way people", "104:22", "think about things not just the primary", "104:25", "question", "104:26", "like does do cigarettes cause cancer but", "104:30", "larger questions of can I trust my", "104:32", "government can I trust science who", "104:34", "should decide these things how certain", "104:35", "do I have to be so it was that kind of", "104:37", "social influence that I was really", "104:39", "interested in and social norms and", "104:42", "social change so I looked at those now", "104:45", "as far as industries I didn't look at I", "104:47", "I didn't write about lead paint because", "104:52", "I already had they did gas but lead", "104:55", "paint has its own long history and and", "104:57", "you know it's just so tragic you look at", "104:59", "these old ads and they're talking about", "105:02", "you know paint your baby's nursery with", "105:05", "this legend and the thing is this like", "105:07", "LED isn't a contaminant of lead paint", "105:09", "lead is like the main ingredient I mean", "105:11", "it was they were basically spreading a", "105:13", "known poison over all of our living", "105:16", "surfaces knowing that it would", "105:18", "eventually crumble knowing that it", "105:21", "accumulates slowly and poisons people", "105:23", "and here's something I read I'm not a", "105:25", "hundred percent sure this is true but", "105:26", "it's heartbreaking that let is sweet so", "105:30", "you hear about children eating lead", "105:31", "ships you think why would they eat lead", "105:33", "ships I guess because it's kind of sweet", "105:36", "so I get benefit of putting blood in", "105:39", "things oh I made a good paint I mean it", "105:41", "you know it was strong and and now of", "105:44", "course we we think of it as these old", "105:46", "old buildings and so we think our that's", "105:48", "crumbling but it did a pretty good job", "105:50", "as a paint if you didn't count the human", "105:53", "impact um did you get any pushback or", "105:57", "did you ever get contacted by any of", "105:59", "these different industries that you're", "106:01", "covering and we concerned at all about", "106:03", "that while you were writing these things", "106:05", "you kind of exposing I'm kind of exposed", "106:07", "to but I actually you know it's funny I", "106:09", "thought about should I be trying to", "106:11", "interview people for all of these and I", "106:13", "really didn't I mean I tried I called F", "106:16", "health corporation which still exists", "106:17", "the company that may let it paint they I", "106:19", "mean not let me let a gas they ended up", "106:22", "moving on to other products they well", "106:24", "they sold it overseas for a long time", "106:26", "but then they also made a lot of other", "106:28", "things so they still exist even though", "106:29", "their product was banned their only", "106:31", "product at the time that they were", "106:32", "started was banned in this country and I", "106:35", "called them up and said so I'm reading", "106:36", "this book about corporate denial and", "106:38", "just wondering you know if you'd like to", "106:40", "talk", "106:40", "about letting get your silence on the", "106:44", "other side of the thorn and then they", "106:45", "were transfer me to somebody else and I", "106:47", "would try it again and get silence and", "106:49", "I'll you know then that would get it", "106:50", "disconnected and it became pretty clear", "106:52", "to me at the beginning that I really it", "106:55", "wasn't going to be all that helpful for", "106:57", "me to say to ask people so tell me about", "106:59", "what you're in denial of because that", "107:03", "that I didn't think that was going to", "107:05", "work very well and and also because my", "107:07", "focus was the public debate and how did", "107:09", "it affect society that's in what I ended", "107:11", "up focusing on the most so you know I I", "107:14", "wasn't worried about the industries as I", "107:16", "was writing this I'm a little worried", "107:18", "now but I mean really I'm just quoting", "107:20", "them so at this point I don't feel like", "107:22", "I'm at particular risk well just I mean", "107:27", "not even risk but that has there been a", "107:31", "reaction by these many of these", "107:33", "interests yeah because their whole thing", "107:34", "is about denial right so I would imagine", "107:35", "you book put out a book about", "107:38", "industrial-strength denial you would get", "107:40", "some denial about that may be but the", "107:45", "you know I've picked such big industries", "107:47", "and these campaigns are so old that", "107:48", "there's nothing particularly newsworthy", "107:50", "about saying that you know the tobacco", "107:52", "companies used to deny that smoking", "107:54", "caused cancer or that the fossil fuel", "107:56", "industry raised all kinds of doubts and", "107:58", "denied climate change was there any", "108:00", "controversy about the the subject matter", "108:03", "and the the topics like were there any", "108:05", "ones each considered not adding oh sure", "108:08", "I mean I I was very nervous about", "108:09", "slavery because it is just such an", "108:12", "emotionally searing topic and because I",
