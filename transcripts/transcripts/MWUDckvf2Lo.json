these people being", "12:26", "developed it's really odd yeah yeah I", "12:28", "mean actually one of the one of the", "12:30", "problems that they they have is that", "12:33", "they're called half man half animal by", "12:37", "the surrounding tribes and so that's one", "12:38", "reason why I've met people that have", "12:41", "been that their families members of", "12:43", "other families have been victim of", "12:45", "cannibalism and so yeah I've had", "12:47", "pictures that Center guys", "12:49", "of cannibalism they actually the", "12:51", "surrounding tribes believe that if you", "12:53", "can consume the flesh of a pygmy that", "12:55", "you can gain superhuman strength I mean", "12:59", "from taking the genitals off of small", "13:01", "bullies and putting them under", "13:02", "businesses it will bring you wealth from", "13:05", "eating their flesh", "13:06", "yeah the rebels believe that if you eat", "13:08", "their flesh that you can what is it it", "13:11", "makes you but not bulletproof but what", "13:13", "is it whenever a bullet can just fly", "13:14", "right through you so basically not", "13:16", "invisible but you're impervious yeah so", "13:18", "it just that's what they believe you", "13:20", "teach children's genitals and they put", "13:22", "them under a business yeah that's what", "13:24", "they'll do to them and no uh", "13:25", "think that that brings them many", "13:27", "blessings it that some of the witch", "13:28", "doctors have done that in Uganda but", "13:29", "they do it in Congo the part of the", "13:32", "Congo that I'm going to is it borders", "13:34", "Rwanda and Uganda and so I'm right over", "13:37", "the border and then in the jungle kind", "13:39", "of boo Nia's where Shalom University is", "13:42", "and then eighty five kilometers from", "13:44", "there there's a part of the Congo called", "13:47", "commander they say it differently than", "13:50", "that but then we go from there", "13:51", "deep into the jungle and where that is", "13:53", "there's some different rebel groups that", "13:55", "have that have done just brutal stuff", "13:58", "there and that's some of their beliefs", "14:01", "there's

on the periodic table every", "14:12", "single one and uh and they have the most", "14:14", "fertile soil they have gold diamonds now", "14:16", "coltan with all this taken off they", "14:18", "should really be the richest country", "14:19", "there is and then all the corruption and", "14:21", "everything just ruins it it's it's so", "14:23", "it's so crazy the corruption is so nuts", "14:26", "the warlords and the whole system that", "14:28", "that they've got going on down there", "14:30", "it's it's so it's so bizarre to look at", "14:33", "you know the United States of America", "14:35", "here in 2013 everything is and then", "14:38", "realizes another part of the world that", "14:39", "exists in the same time that is", "14:41", "essentially living the way people lived", "14:43",

head what is it", "25:35", "like this spear heads about this long", "25:37", "and it's heavy I mean at all yeah", "25:39", "actually they they have this the wood", "25:42", "part of it in the middle of a Masai", "25:44", "warrior Spears uh from like a olive tree", "25:47", "of some sort okay then they put it", "25:49", "through the fire and make it really", "25:50", "really strong it's a hard wood anyway", "25:52", "they they know how to treat it through", "25:54", "the fire make it like rock-solid", "25:56", "and then one end is almost like looks", "25:58", "like a javelin and so that's then that", "26:00", "they use for either target practice or", "26:01", "just sticking it in the ground whenever", "26:02", "they're walking around the other and", "26:04", "they only use for whenever they come", "26:05", "across the line Wow so one end they", "26:09", "throw it just like to just to practice", "26:11", "yeah and we took some balloons over", "26:13", "there to see if the kids would like it", "26:16", "and to be honest though the Warriors", "26:19", "liked the balloons better than anything", "26:20", "because we'd blow up those balloons and", "26:22", "just tie them throw them on the ground", "26:24", "and then they would the different", "26:26", "warriors would stock the balloons almost", "26:28", "on every time almost the first throw", "26:30", "every single time they nailed it Wow how", "26:32", "far away I mean not too far because the", "26:36", "winds blowing and they're they're", "26:37", "stocking it and whenever they're going", "26:39", "after a lion they normally wait until", "26:40", "they're close because if they miss you", "26:43", "know so they they wait till it's close", "26:45", "and so I mean probably hear to the", "26:47", "doorman only like 20 feet well I guess", "26:50", "some of them did it farther where some", "26:52", "were getting it from all the way to the", "26:54", "to the window so someone could actually", "26:56", "throw him pretty good and sometimes they", "26:57", "get jacked when they go after these", "26:59", "lions oh yeah the the spear that I have", "27:03", "the guy this the warrior that gave it to", "27:06", "me seems
