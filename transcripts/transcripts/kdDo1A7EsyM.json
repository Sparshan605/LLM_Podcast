that is you", "43:38", "know if you're gonna look for a silver", "43:39", "lining to this it it shows that it's not", "43:42", "it's is they just want a space where", "43:47", "their religious

someone for now for", "44:36", "other reasons that are fairly depressing", "44:39", "in their own right they're willing to to", "44:42", "vote for someone who's who doesn't", "44:44", "really play the game the way they do you", "44:50", "have to believe in God to be president", "44:53", "in 2016 right when you wouldn't you say", "44:55", "that has to pretend to believe in God", "44:56", "yeah but I think with Trump I think it I", "45:00", "think his the pretense is is obvious", "45:03", "enough that I don't think he's fooling", "45:05", "the better part of the people who were", "45:08", "voting for him who would say they care", "45:11", "about a person of faith being in the", "45:13", "White House so anything he might be in", "45:16", "one thing he might be breaking is the", "45:18",
