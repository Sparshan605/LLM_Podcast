"11:15", "intel intelligence from other worlds and", "11:17", "when I was writing the phenomena book I", "11:19", "learned a whole bunch of new information", "11:22", "about how upset they were with my story", "11:25", "because they Baloo the source by the way", "11:28", "they knew the source and they believed", "11:30", "that he was fed misinformation", "11:33", "so these are two sides of the

this", "14:42", "weaponry and they gave me his name and", "14:45", "we talked for days and hours about", "14:47", "nuclear weapons and then in one", "14:50", "conversation he began to cry and told me", "14:54", "this story that I was like what why is", "14:58", "he crying he was crying because he", "15:01", "participated in our version of the human", "15:04", "experiments because what the

not", "117:49", "that long ago it's just not do I mean", "117:55", "people people just read and read and", "117:58", "read about World War two for good reason", "118:01", "you know and everything I write starts", "118:03", "it all goes back to the Nazis and every", "118:06", "book I the the trail the paper trail at", "118:10", "the National Archives or individual", "118:12", "university libraries and people's papers", "118:15", "where I go they all refer back to that", "118:17", "because it was so remarkable that the", "118:20", "Nazis led in weapons technology and they", "118:23", "almost took over the world because of it", "118:25", "right and that is the premise of all of", "118:28", "this I mean in surprise kill vanish it's", "118:29", "like these are the guys on the ground in", "118:32", "the Pentagon's brain it's this is the", "118:34", "technology in the sky but we must we the", "118:38", "government's position whether its", "118:40", "Pentagon CIA is always we have to stay", "118:44", "ahead because the next Nazi Germany is", "118:47", "right around the corner yeah and that's", "118:48", "a that's really something to think about", "118:51", "is that alarmist well to this history", "118:54", "repeats itself I mean how if we went and", "118:56", "stopped and looked at all the instances", "118:58", "throughout history of people being evil", "119:00", "dictators there's quite a few and", "119:02", "there's you know we've we could look at", "119:04", "North Korea right now and that guy", "119:06", "assassinated his own uncle right with a", "119:08",

and having information that", "119:52", "always puts me in conflict with you know", "119:54", "the government in essence because I'm", "119:56", "I'm like we should know but then you", "119:58", "think about it well the whole thing is", "119:59", "you were not supposed to know because", "120:01", "it's supposed to be just the hidden hand", "120:03", "the president's hidden hand they call it", "120:04", "well it has to be this distinction that", "120:07", "they have the ability to break the rules", "120:09", "because it's how they protect us I mean", "120:11", "that that's that's the rub right and the", "120:15", "stories we hear are often the failures", "120:18", "because those are the ones that get", "120:19", "reported in the press there is a sense", "120:21", "under girding this

plausibly denied right yeah", "120:37", "there's got to be a ton of them that", "120:38", "went through", "120:39", "you don't hear nothing about and your", "120:42", "kids will hear about Boeing maybe when", "120:44", "you think about protecting us from", "120:46", "something like another Nazi Germany", "120:49", "that's when people are willing to give", "120:52", "up some of the freedoms they're willing", "120:54", "to give up surveillance they're willing", "120:56", "to give up and this is this is where", "120:58", "things get real slippery right I mean", "121:01", "also when you think about Russia because", "121:04", "all of this Cold War science technology", "121:11", "operations all of that was to beat back", "121:14", "the Russians okay then the Russians go", "121:16", "away and now they're back you know the", "121:18", "Russians are the master assassins and", "121:20", "they do it through poisoning I mean look", "121:23", "at scre Paul right no I write it in the", "121:26", "book about a defector who came over in", "121:29", "the 50s and said I was an assassin for", "121:32", "the KGB", "121:34", "gave us all kinds of information it's", "121:36", "fascinating to look at those documents", "121:37", "and realize like this is how it works", "121:40", "this is how it worked you know 60 years", "121:43", "ago and then you kind of see echoes of", "121:46", "that
