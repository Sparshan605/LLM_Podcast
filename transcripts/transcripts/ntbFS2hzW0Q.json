women", "11:12", "are in a public place they have no", "11:15", "reasonable expectation of privacy", "11:16", "therefore he should be allowed to take", "11:18", "upskirt pictures of them how absurd is", "11:20", "that argument anyway we cover it on the", "11:21", "show we share our you know opinion on it", "11:24", "and I would say like about 1/3 of the", "11:26", "audience was like yeah they're right", "11:28", "yeah and as a dumb bitch what if she", "11:31", "doesn't know anything First Amendment", "11:32", "rights and it's like ah what am I", "11:34", "supposed to do with these types of", "11:35", "situations it's really frustrating", "11:42", "that's like some trader shit right there", "11:44", "yeah I would be very curious to see if", "11:48", "she would be ok with this dude with her", "11:49", "own client taking upskirt pictures with", "11:51", "her or of her and another argument she", "11:54", "made was what I mean all these women", "11:56", "were wearing underwear we didn't
