got", "39:46", "to think like how much like if you're on", "39:48", "EPO how much does that really allow you", "39:51", "to train extra time how much does that", "39:54", "allow you to recover what's the Bennett", "39:56", "like what is the quantifiable benefit it", "39:58", "must be pretty significant because", "40:00", "there's a lot of you know the cyclists a", "40:03", "lot of a lot of heavy-duty endurance", "40:04", "athletes use it and I almost want to try", "40:07", "it you know they say that these", "40:10", "executives are trying they're doing EPO", "40:13", "and entering into

"40:23", "epidemic of really boost you that much", "40:26", "like okay you're gonna take it and", "40:28", "you're gonna notice that you're able to", "40:29", "like like the other day you could barely", "40:31", "finish a roll a loop around the Rose", "40:33", "Bowl a three-mile loop and then you", "40:35", "start taking it and you can get what", "40:37", "five six miles energy I wonder I wonder", "40:39", "I think what it does is it raises your", "40:41", "threshold if you're already an elite", "40:43", "endurance athlete too I think for them", "40:45", "that's what it is it's like they're", "40:47", "already looking for that extra edge so", "40:48", "they're already in elite endurance", "40:49", "athletes already in the Tour de France", "40:51", "and they take that EPO and it's like wow", "40:54", "just just jacks them up they could just", "40:56", "do more work they have more oxygen they", "41:00", "don't run out of juice and for a guy", "41:02", "like TJ his style is so kinetic there's", "41:04", "so much movement explosion some juice", "41:06", "dances like he needs that juice it's not", "41:09", "like a calm easy game where he's you", "41:12", "know everything's fast fast fast fast", "41:14", "fast it's crazy it's hard it it's it's a", "41:19", "hard one to swallow yeah man so for me", "41:22", "like I was like man I was gonna come on", "41:24", "Joe Rogan

me what's the words well let me", "41:37", "talk about what I made a mistake I don't", "41:39", "want to talk about this I have no answer", "41:44", "for it I don't understand that it's like", "41:45", "all I'd wanted like I just doesn't feel", "41:48", "like a good conversation because all I", "41:49", "could do is just it just get like you", "41:52", "said it's just gonna take away from what", "41:55", "I've seen as", "41:56", "then the more I imagine about it it's", "41:58", "just going to be more take away and then", "41:59", "anything I could say or think about I", "42:02", "can't think of anything that solution or", "42:05", "our sis yeah yeah yeah I don't think", "42:08", "anybody I mean I think we're in this", "42:11", "stage right now where they're probably", "42:12", "looking at the data going okay what is", "42:15", "this signify and how many more people", "42:17", "should we test mm-hmm no once once they", "42:19", "develop a new method of testing that's", "42:21", "the whole reason why they want to keep", "42:23", "the old samples anyway there's new more", "42:25", "sensitive methods of detecting right are", "42:27", "invented and you know about this stuff", "42:29", "because I know that you you're a science", "42:31", "freak and you're saying yeah dark", "42:35", "especially when it comes to anything", "42:38", "that can enhance the this life that we", "42:39", "have on this earth so yeah sure you know", "42:42", "a lot about this stuff well I've had a", "42:44", "really amazing conversation with many", "42:49", "people about it and David

coming up", "43:01", "with", "43:01", "but what I've come through with is at", "43:06", "the other end this there are probably", "43:08", "hundreds of thousands of people that are", "43:12", "involved in either legitimate", "43:15", "supplements or legitimate molecules or", "43:18", "testing hormones on people or you know", "43:22", "trying all these different things to try", "43:24", "to figure

figured out a way", "46:11", "to open the bottle without cracking the", "46:12", "seal its debates they swapped piss I", "46:15", "mean it was a super sophisticated stuff", "46:17", "and this guy details all of it by", "46:20", "accident just because he had hired this", "46:22", "guy to give him drug", "46:23", "so he could he was just trying to run a", "46:25", "document let's see how much better", "46:27", "steroids make me at riding the bike and", "46:29", "when all this stuff broke he just came", "46:32", "in at the right place at the right time", "46:33", "and it's amazing it's amazing that's why", "46:36", "Russia won like all these gold medals", "46:38", "and the Sochi Olympics they were all", "46:40", "Jews to the tits and you're saying all", "46:42", "of them huh yes it's just for me like", "46:44", "it's it's just it's one of those things", "46:47", "like I just don't have no an answer to", "46:49", "it I know there's always going to be", "46:50", "people who are gonna look for an", "46:51", "advantage yeah and I think as long as", "46:53", "some but there's one person looking for", "46:55", "an advantage then I think there's some", "46:58", "people are gonna have the attitude that", "47:00", "if there's an advantage out there I'm a", "47:01", "fool for not taking it the people who", "47:03", "don't take it are people who are are", "47:06", "gifted in some way or have just a work", "47:09", "ethic that goes beyond and it's a matter", "47:11", "of pride that they don't do it you know", "47:12", "like when you're a sharp kid you don't", "47:14", "it's like a matter of pride to never", "47:15", "cheat on a test whereas some people that", "47:17", "they're go to you know yeah it's it's", "47:19", "interesting it's like what is what's", "47:21", "legal and what's not legal like what", "47:24", "should you be allowed to do you should", "47:25", "you be allowed to use cryotherapy but if", "47:28", "it turns out that cryotherapy ramps up", "47:30", "your hormones what if it turns out the", "47:31", "cryotherapy speeds up your recovery", "47:33", "that's commensurate with a steroid but", "47:36", "why shouldn't you be able to use it you", "47:38", "should be able to but I'm just saying", "47:40", "cuz I think the basis of that is that", "47:42", "some of these other things are supposed", "47:43", "to be maybe dangerous for you", "47:45", "EPO that sure is that that's the reason", "47:47", "that's the base recently that I don't", "47:49", "know that but I think that's our base", "47:51", "reasoning right I think the base", "47:52", "reasoning is cheating well no not just", "47:54", "cheating because it's not cheating if", "47:56", "everyone's doing it well but for sure I", "47:59", "mean so there's supposed to be stuff so", "48:01", "like hormones but I'm talking about", "48:04", "hormone like you can use vitamins or", "48:06", "anything or you can have good nutrition", "48:08", "that's that makes sense anything that's", "48:10", "going to make you better at what you're", "48:11", "doing but there's ones that we don't", "48:13", "want people to use because they're", "48:14", "dangerous to use for those reasons is", "48:17", "the I think that's supposed to be the", "48:18", "reason right I do not know if that", "48:20", "reason makes sense I don't know whether", "48:23", "it makes sense or not yeah but I think", "48:24", "that's supposed to be the because we're", "48:26", "thinking that come when does it come", "48:27", "around say well we don't want you using", "48:29", "any artificial supplements vitamins we", "48:31", "want you to get all your vitamins from", "48:32", "your food what you're doing is you're", "48:34", "getting some of your vitamins", "48:35", "artificially and it's", "48:36", "human being gifted so like there's a", "48:38", "line that's being drawn somewhere right", "48:40", "and I'm saying the line is being drawn", "48:42", "at what is supposed to be safe one", "48:44", "at one point it got drawn at that and", "48:46", "then became something else maybe I don't", "48:49", "know think if they were really concerned", "48:52", "with safety they wouldn't let them fight", "48:54", "well we're not talking what about all", "48:56", "sport I know but I mean especially with", "48:58", "fighting if you're really concerned with", "49:00", "safety let's just cancel the whole event", "49:02", "like someone's gonna get hurt", "49:04", "yeah well there's a lot of things I said", "49:07", "you know that we don't like the fighters", "49:08", "to jump on the top of the cage because", "49:10", "Larry", "49:11", "yeah it's unsafe well leave just kicking", "49:13", "each other kicking each other in the", "49:14", "face get off get down off that cage are", "49:18", "you doing it Ella Brayton yeah the", "49:22", "celebrating thing is funny man let him", "49:24", "celebrate yeah they don't like him to do", "49:25", "a flip well one guy did he did a flip",

guys trying to defend guys", "74:40", "trying to get out of half guard get in", "74:42", "the mount and and then you'll see a", "74:44", "referee come over and just separate it", "74:45", "because the crowds booing or because", "74:47", "they don't understand what's happening", "74:49", "how much of a struggle it is right", "74:51", "especially clinch work exactly guys get", "74:54", "a guy up against the cage", "74:56", "there's they're working for something", "74:57", "they might stall each other out but", "74:59", "eventually someone might break down", "75:02", "I mean and this is how a guy like", "75:04", "nurmagomedov wins fights against elite", "75:07", "guys this is how Randy Couture won a lot", "75:09", "of fights it's a legitimate tactic yes", "75:12", "it doesn't look fun for

me you know I mean so I", "75:40", "don't want to I want to interfere as", "75:42", "little as possible yeah I know and so", "75:44", "that's that's my goal and so I you know", "75:46", "I give them instruction if I tell them", "75:47", "you know hey work work or what I expect", "75:49", "and you know I expect you to do", "75:51", "something - I'm looking for big shots or", "75:54", "advance your

"the other weight classes you know then", "76:18", "they don't have that one punch always", "76:20", "you know some of the guys do but not", "76:22", "everyone does and that's where things", "76:24", "are going to get cited in that clinch", "76:26", "and if there's attention if there's a", "76:28", "tension there we need to see where", "76:29", "that's gonna go and let it you know work", "76:31", "itself out I'm so glad you said that", "76:32", "that's the perfect way to say it and", "76:34", "that's absolutely 100% agree and there's", "76:37", "there's moments where it changes the", "76:39", "course of the fight where it's really", "76:40", "unfortunate", "76:41", "you didn't referee tomorrow you semana", "76:44", "Demian Maia did you and I don't think so", "76:46", "whoever did that one we don't even have", "76:49", "to pull it up but there was a moment in", "76:51", "the first round when Demian Maia got", "76:53", "ahold of camar\u00f3n was trying to take his", "76:54", "back standing and he had like one hook", "76:57", "in and the clinch and he was hanging on", "76:59", "to him and the referee decided not", "77:01", "enough was taking place they separated", "77:02", "him

any other a lot of", "77:42", "interesting take down from there to", "77:43", "while he's like he does goes back and", "77:45", "forth with halfway taking your back and", "77:47", "then one you're defending the takedown", "77:49", "he starts taking your back and yeah when", "77:50", "you go back then he's back working on", "77:52", "yeah so no he works really he works at a", "77:54", "real interesting pace there you know", "77:56", "it's stunning to watch him go through", "77:58", "guys like when he went through Rick's", "78:00", "story I was like Jesus Christ like Rick", "78:03",
