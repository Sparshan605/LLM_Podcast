"counterpolitics are out of that weight", "26:35", "class", "26:36", "now some of the fights we'd get to see", "26:40", "like i'd love to see him in ferguson", "26:41", "would be", "26:43", "in the fight yeah that's the fight 100", "26:45", "now yeah after ferguson dominated pettis", "26:47", "like that", "26:47", "and then also overcame that big shot", "26:49", "where he got hurt yeah",

awesome", "26:59", "i would like to see it in the future i", "27:00", "mean but conor would have to do", "27:02", "something", "27:03", "to show that he first of all", "27:06", "there is absolutely a factor", "27:10", "in that he had not been fighting for two", "27:12", "years yeah", "27:14", "one boxing match in two years is just", "27:16", "not good enough", "27:17", "for mma especially with wrestling just", "27:19", "not good enough", "27:20", "and then i think he would have to", "27:23", "like really really concentrate on his", "27:26", "wrestling", "27:27", "and even that even that i mean how much", "27:30", "better can he get", "27:31", "dude that guy was wrestling a bear as a", "27:33", "kid yeah", "27:34", "i mean he's so much better yeah he's so", "27:37", "much back in time",

stripped of a title", "33:53", "because they tested positive for thc and", "33:56", "beta blockers yeah", "33:58", "this is real recent right oh yeah yeah", "34:00", "when i competed", "34:01", "um so i mean yeah you uh you're", "34:04", "depending on what level you're", "34:06", "at there was because i shot with the", "34:09", "us team certain tournaments didn't have", "34:12", "doping and then

about alcohol and how alcohol", "35:10", "could", "35:10", "help shooter because we i we were", "35:12", "talking about a guy that had done well", "35:14", "at tournaments several times and i said", "35:16", "yeah he always does good and he said", "35:17", "yeah he's always he's always drunk", "35:20", "and i'm like what do you mean and he", "35:22", "said well he goes", "35:24", "if you play alcohol the right way and", "35:26", "you're like", "35:28", "not sloppy drunk but you're he yeah he", "35:31", "just like stays in his zone and he's", "35:33", "just", "35:34", "kind of sitting there drinking the whole", "35:35", "time and that was but like", "35:37", "prior to where they were testing for", "35:39", "alcohol so he actually made us", "35:41", "uh he said all right well let's see how", "35:44", "you how you do if you shoot when you", "35:45", "have a buzz going so", "35:47", "you know we we drank and shot and uh", "35:51", "you know don't try this at home kids uh", "35:53", "it wasn't an archery range where they", "35:55", "have to buy insurance or whatever but uh", "35:57", "yeah and it you know that was part of it", "36:00", "because at the time this was in the mid", "36:02", "90s", "36:04", "another archer that had won a bunch of", "36:06", "titles also", "36:07", "tested positive for beta blockers and", "36:10", "had had some titles stripped", "36:12", "but then for the longest time that was", "36:14", "one of my complaints was once i was", "36:16", "shooting", "36:17", "um at a level with with the teams and we", "36:20", "we had to go through testing or be", "36:24", "like if for example at an event when i", "36:27", "meddled", "36:28", "if you're in the top three immediately", "36:30", "you get tested i mean so that's how it", "36:32", "is so you know", "36:33", "everyone there is level they're all", "36:36", "level", "36:36", "but then you go to other events like for", "36:38", "example some of the biggest", "36:40", "money events were the 3d shoots and that", "36:43", "was a big reason why i left those shoots", "36:45", "because at those tournaments", "36:47", "there was no testing there was no", "36:50", "testing", "36:50", "there was clearly guys there that were", "36:52", "shooting that were kind of just", "36:54", "out of it there could be fifty thousand", "36:56", "dollars on the line", "36:57", "and there was just no not a sweat", "37:00", "cracked", "37:01", "because there you know some of that", "37:02", "stuff obviously it is a performance", "37:05", "enhancer because of the fact they're not", "37:07", "having a deal", "37:08", "with adrenaline spikes and accelerated", "37:10", "heart rate for people don't know what", "37:12", "we're talking about 3d shoots are a type", "37:13", "of tournament where", "37:15", "they have those uh realistic looking", "37:18", "targets", "37:19", "so foam elks or a foam bear and they", "37:22", "have", "37:22", "yep areas that you're supposed to hit", "37:24", "yeah and um", "37:26", "the other thing was i didn't like the", "37:28", "fact that at that time", "37:31", "when you scored it was just based off if", "37:33", "there's four guys in the group", "37:35", "whatever the majority voted that's how", "37:36", "it scored and when there's a lot of", "37:38", "money on the line", "37:39", "so like say you shot and i shot jamie", "37:42", "shot", "37:42", "and sharon shot we'd walk up and you", "37:45", "know it's", "37:46", "their foam ring so the arrow could look", "37:49", "like it's in it could look like it's out", "37:51", "but it's not a clear line", "37:53", "and we would just if me you and jamie", "37:55", "said that's out then", "37:56", "even if sharon's was close it'd be out", "37:58", "um so", "37:59", "i was in some groups where things got a", "38:02", "little shady people were wanting to make", "38:04", "money", "38:05", "and it got apparent that it wasn't you", "38:07", "know there wasn't a judge", "38:08", "there calling every score which on a", "38:11", "world level", "38:12", "there's judges there oh so if you guys", "38:14", "were all competing against each other", "38:15", "you would call for each other", "38:18", "i've seen

that's crazy yeah i mean you", "51:25", "can take it to a point but it's crazy i", "51:27", "still think it's code", "51:29", "it's a weird code the other argument", "51:31", "though too is just from a hunting", "51:33", "situation jamie is the person who", "51:34", "doesn't hunt at all", "51:36", "i mean i i've heard it so i unders like", "51:38", "it's not a new concept to me but i'm", "51:40", "trying to compare it to something else", "51:41", "like if it was", "51:42", "like a basketball hoop i found somewhere", "51:44", "like don't tell somebody to go to that", "51:45", "playground because it's my hoop", "51:47", "and i show up and people are there", "51:48", "playing a public playground find another", "51:50", "hoop to play on", "51:51", "well or you don't play basketball it", "51:53", "seems it seems", "51:54", "ridiculous silly but i'm just trying to", "51:56", "think yeah that you like", "51:57", "you have us especially in today's day", "51:59", "and age because today people use", "52:01", "like onyx maps and they use", "52:04", "google earth and you you could find", "52:07", "these", "52:07", "beautiful spots and you just go out to", "52:10", "them", "52:11", "like if you find a beautiful spot on", "52:12", "google earth you go out to it", "52:14", "and you go hey man this is a spot i", "52:16", "found don't go there there's as much but", "52:19", "this is my spot on public land", "52:22", "it seems ridiculous yeah it does it does", "52:24", "but there", "52:25", "i think there's a legitimate code to it", "52:28", "it seems ridiculous but", "52:29", "it seems understandable that someone", "52:31", "would be upset", "52:32", "if they're looking forward to going to a", "52:34", "place and they told you about it a year", "52:36", "ago", "52:37", "and they go to that place they hike in", "52:39", "takes them nine miles", "52:40", "and then you're there yeah tough shit", "52:43", "[Laughter]", "52:44", "go another nine should have got there", "52:47", "earlier you", "52:48", "procrastinating motherfucker", "52:51", "i'm taking you with me when we're going", "52:53", "to someone's spot i'll let you don't", "52:55", "no one owns any spots see that's what's", "52:58", "so weird about it to me", "52:59", "it's it's there there definitely is a", "53:02", "there definitely is a line", "53:04", "i mean i i see your argument 100", "53:07", "and i know it you know at some point it", "53:09", "it could definitely get", "53:10", "childish or out of hand i mean obviously", "53:12", "there's a ton of ton of stuff", "53:14", "but out of courtesy yeah i mean if any", "53:17", "time you showed me something cool if", "53:18", "you're like hey i got this cool thing", "53:20", "that's what i do", "53:21", "you know it's kind of private take my", "53:23", "family there whatever i'd be like", "53:25", "yeah i respect that but it's not private", "53:28", "that's what's weird yeah what's weird is", "53:30", "the whole water's not either", "53:32", "public land but fishermen would be the", "53:34", "same right but it's", "53:35", "captains captains it is thing about", "53:38", "public land", "53:39", "is that it's supposed to be everyone's", "53:42", "so if you find a really good area", "53:45", "in public land that's supposed to be", "53:47", "available for everyone", "53:49", "but that's not what everybody wants what", "53:52", "everybody wants that's one of the things", "53:53", "about people", "53:54", "not wanting new people to get into", "53:56", "hunting", "53:58", "like i've heard this argument before", "54:00", "like you shouldn't be telling people to", "54:01", "get into hunting because it's already", "54:02", "tough", "54:03", "tough enough out there on public land", "54:05", "there's already so many people hunting", "54:06", "on public land if", "54:07", "more people get into hunting there's", "54:08", "gonna be more pressure", "54:10", "like what yeah that's that's not me i'm", "54:13", "definitely looking to get more people in", "54:15", "for sure", "54:16", "right because you're thinking they don't", "54:18", "they don't know about your spots", "54:20", "[Laughter]", "54:21", "i'll find a new spot that's a good", "54:23", "attitude one of the um", "54:25", "one of the questions or i guess", "54:27", "arguments too", "54:28", "is you know i don't understand it when", "54:30", "people", "54:32", "they don't have any tolerance for", "54:35", "like hunting private land so to speak or", "54:38", "they don't have tolerance for", "54:39", "you know i don't mind people that that", "54:42", "hunt", "54:42", "like exotic ranches or hunt high fence", "54:45", "that's just not", "54:46", "that's like not what i personally like", "54:49", "but i also understand that people do", "54:51", "but i i also don't like it when people", "54:53", "are like super negative to that but yet", "54:55", "they'll have like a bowl and a pen", "54:59", "or they'll have chickens in a cage or", "55:01", "they'll have a goat", "55:03", "and they're like raisins and they're", "55:04", "raising a goat to slaughter", "55:06", "i don't know is it yeah it is because", "55:07", "it's just a different scale", "55:09", "no but it's not because it shows that", "55:10", "there's a different thing in the pursuit", "55:12", "of a wild animal there's a different", "55:13", "thing to that", "55:15", "like like here's the thing say if you", "55:18", "there's a ranch and the ranch is 5 000", "55:21", "acres which is big", "55:22", "but not the biggest yeah and on that 5", "55:24", "000", "55:25", "acre ranch someone shoots a giant buck", "55:29", "like a huge 2 4 240 inch mule deer", "55:32", "like epic deer and people like wow but", "55:35", "it's a private ranch", "55:37", "and you kind of know that there wasn't a", "55:40", "lot of pressure there so they probably", "55:41", "knew where this deer was", "55:43", "and people that worked in this ranch", "55:44", "told people about this deer and they", "55:46", "kind of kept their eye on it and they", "55:47", "knew where to go to find him", "55:49", "yep versus you uh", "55:52", "getting your truck driving four hours", "55:55", "outside of reno", "55:56", "in nevada getting out into the mountains", "55:59", "by yourself", "56:00", "you're like setting up camp by yourself", "56:03", "spending", "56:03", "three or four days just scouting just", "56:05", "finding your spot", "56:06", "finding your animals out there finding", "56:09", "your spot", "56:10", "but it's more difficult is the point so", "56:12", "like if someone accomplishes that", "56:16", "you look at it differently yeah than", "56:18", "someone who shot something in a high", "56:19", "ranch in texas", "56:21", "it's just a different thing yeah but", "56:23", "what i don't what i'm saying is", "56:25", "like hunters versus non-hunters people", "56:28", "that are non-hunting", "56:29", "that really look down on like what we're", "56:31", "talking about as hunters", "56:33", "but yet they'll raise a goat right to", "56:35", "slaughter but they're not pretending", "56:37", "that it's some sort of pursuit", "56:38", "man versus ant see the thing about the", "56:40", "hunting thing is", "56:42", "you're you're looking at it like it's a", "56:44", "difficult pursuit", "56:46", "like you're out there trying to outwit", "56:48", "this animal for me yeah", "56:50", "yeah that's what i like about it but if", "56:51", "you're in a 400-acre fenced-in", "56:54", "property with a bunch of exotics running", "56:57", "around you're sitting in a tree stand", "56:58", "there's a pile of corn down there", "57:00", "and you're waiting for an animal to walk", "57:01", "over to that corn and you whack it", "57:03", "that is very different than say what you", "57:06", "did", "57:07", "this year in alberta when you were", "57:09", "telling me that you were hiking", "57:11", "hundreds of i mean how how many days did", "57:13", "you guys go", "57:15", "i think we went nine did a hundred miles", "57:19", "yeah so you hiked a hundred miles in the", "57:21", "wilderness", "57:22", "for nine days no elk and never never got", "57:25", "one never got one yeah yeah", "57:27", "that is very different yep right so", "57:30", "oh yeah that's real hunting in", "57:33", "comparison to someone who's sitting over", "57:35", "a pile of corn in a fenced-in ranch", "57:37", "yeah that's that's why i think people", "57:39", "have a problem with it", "57:40", "yeah that anybody would compare what you", "57:43", "did", "57:44", "to that and then there's like the", "57:46", "intermediary", "57:48", "which is like a really nice ranch that's", "57:51", "not a high fence but it's a private", "57:53", "ranch", "57:54", "like the place we went to in utah yeah", "57:56", "that is it's private not everybody can", "57:58", "go there but those are just wild animals", "58:00", "roaming around and yeah and", "58:02", "opportunities high", "58:04", "yes more opportunity but no", "58:07", "nothing's fenced in nothing's keeping", "58:09", "the animals there and they those animals", "58:10", "have been there for thousands of years", "58:12", "yeah that's just what they do you just", "58:14", "have the opportunity to hunt", "58:16", "a wild animal on a piece of property", "58:19", "where", "58:19", "there's not going to be a lot of people", "58:20", "there yep", "58:22", "yeah i it's my preference", "58:25", "i like doing i really like the balance", "58:28", "of having really tough hunts", "58:30", "especially because i knew my you know my", "58:34", "utah hunt wouldn't quite be the same", "58:36", "that was kind of a very different", "58:38", "experience for me i haven't ever like", "58:40", "had an opportunity like that so that was", "58:42", "you know quite a", "58:44", "quite a difference for me whereas", "58:46", "between the other states that i hunted i", "58:48", "think i did", "58:49", "i think i was right it up just over 200", "58:52", "miles before", "58:53", "uh before we got our first bull you know", "58:56", "between there and then hunting", "58:58", "some uh some private land but also some", "59:01", "public land in montana before", "59:03", "finally getting you know that first elk", "59:05", "can you talk about what happened with", "59:07", "montana with the", "59:07", "the bear um yeah i mean i can talk about", "59:11", "it", "59:11", "they actually text me back and ruled", "59:14", "back that it was not a grizzly", "59:16", "what yeah they say it's a um a colored", "59:20", "black bear do you think that's true um", "59:23", "yeah", "59:23", "it's possible i was gonna pull up the", "59:25", "pictures um it's an enormous black bear", "59:28", "yeah yeah it did you thought it was a", "59:30", "grizzly yep yeah we shot a", "59:32", "actually um our our mutual friend andy", "59:35", "stumpf she had a bull", "59:36", "on 911 which was which was pretty", "59:40", "um pretty cool for him to have an", "59:42", "experience like that", "59:43", "and it took us um i forget how far out", "59:46", "we were", "59:46", "just several several miles from camp and", "59:49", "we", "59:50", "it took us two trips to pack this bull", "59:54", "out", "59:54", "and uh the first pack out that we did i", "59:58", "think we finally got back to camp i", "59:59", "don't know somewhere around midnight or", "60:01", "something so", "60:02", "the next morning we went back at first", "60:04", "light took us a while to pack back in", "60:05", "there", "60:06", "and when we got there um half of the", "60:09", "carcass", "60:09", "i had already pulled everything apart we", "60:12", "had everything game bags everything was", "60:13", "strung up on trees", "60:16", "but the actual cavity was half buried", "60:19", "and as we were approaching i seen", "60:21", "something kind of running off", "60:23", "and by the coloration on the hide i", "60:25", "really thought for sure it was a grizz", "60:28", "because i've seen lots of them and we", "60:30", "got up there and sure enough it was", "60:32", "it was buried so we kind of took a lot", "60:34", "of precaution as we were trying to", "60:36", "tell people just explain to people what", "60:38", "that means so a grizzly", "60:41", "they will bury something that they find", "60:44", "and they i think they do it for a couple", "60:45", "reasons", "60:46", "one of the reasons is they want they", "60:49", "don't want", "60:49", "um like prey birds like crows and stuff", "60:52", "to be able to see it because they'll", "60:54", "start talking and then", "60:55", "other predators in the area listen for", "60:57", "those birds and then", "60:58", "you know it's kind of a magnet starts to", "61:00", "draw so they like to conceal it", "61:02", "so they'll literally kind of pivot on a", "61:05", "circle around that kill and actually", "61:07", "claw the ground and and bury them", "61:11", "and it's pretty like i've seen uh where", "61:13", "grizzlies bury a full moose", "61:15", "and it's it is ridiculous", "61:19", "the type of dirt they can move i'm", "61:21", "talking it looks like a skid loader came", "61:23", "in there", "61:24", "and buried these things and they can do", "61:26", "they can do that kind of work", "61:27", "fairly quick but they'll pile up", "61:30", "everything around it", "61:31", "and then they kind of normally will", "61:33", "create one small little hole", "61:35", "at the end of that mound where they'll", "61:37", "kind of crawl in there and they", "61:39", "literally like eat", "61:40", "from one side to the other side you know", "61:44", "and uh and it's it's normally", "61:48", "the back end first um so yeah", "61:52", "i felt like we had just got there when", "61:55", "this bear had just", "61:57", "discovered the carcass and had just", "62:00", "started the burial process because", "62:02", "you know he hadn't pulled anything out", "62:04", "of the trees he had only started to", "62:06", "cover the", "62:07", "the carcass which normally they'll cover", "62:08", "that seal first", "62:10", "then they'll clean up the scraps around", "62:12", "and then they'd go", "62:13", "to their pile and kind of consume that", "62:15", "last", "62:16", "but i was certain that we had seen one", "62:19", "we ended up seeing", "62:20", "a wildlife biologist later on", "62:23", "and i told him you know i thought i saw", "62:25", "griz and he told me he said well", "62:28", "it's pretty important if you did because", "62:30", "there hasn't", "62:31", "been one naturally on this hill", "62:34", "and i think he said a hundred years so", "62:37", "he's like", "62:38", "you know would you be willing to go back", "62:40", "in there to put a camera up", "62:42", "which is not smart if it was a if it was", "62:45", "a grizzly it's", "62:46", "i mean obviously they're going to be", "62:49", "depending on their demeanor they could", "62:50", "be very protective of that", "62:53", "but we did end up going back in there", "62:55", "just to put the camera up and then", "62:57", "after the camera was there a few weeks", "62:59", "he sent the picture and said you were", "63:02", "close to being right", "63:03", "it's just a perfectly colored", "63:07", "uh black bear that looks like like it", "63:10", "would be a grizzly but how does he know", "63:11", "for sure", "63:13", "you can tell by they don't have um", "63:16", "you thought it was grizzly when you saw", "63:17", "the photo yeah they they don't have a", "63:19", "very", "63:19", "i thought it was a younger one but they", "63:21", "don't have a very distinct", "63:23", "hump on their back and then the claw", "63:25", "marks see he went in", "63:27", "you can tell a lot by the claws so when", "63:29", "you go in and you look at the tracks", "63:31", "that's also a really easy way because", "63:33", "like", "63:33", "like that bear that was wrestling khabib", "63:37", "you could see the claws like grizzlies", "63:40", "have very very distinct", "63:42", "claws so that was uh", "63:46", "just look in here so i can't really", "63:50", "pull up the pick for everything send it", "63:52", "to jamie let me check it out", "63:57", "yeah i could see that that's luke yeah", "63:59", "and and that does actually kind of look", "64:01", "like a brown bear now that i look at it", "64:02", "and then", "64:03", "black bear rather yeah and then running", "64:05", "the head is going to be narrower", "64:07", "and it took several pictures some of the", "64:10", "pictures it looked", "64:11", "more like a griz just because the", "64:12", "coloration some of the pictures it", "64:14", "didn't so", "64:15", "um you know and keep in mind you know", "64:18", "mountain grizzlies will look a little", "64:19", "bit different than like a coastal bear", "64:21", "or you know inland grizzly but either", "64:24", "way", "64:24", "it was it was a bear that came in and", "64:27", "you know", "64:28", "covered the whole carcass and went to", "64:29", "eat it now when you were in alberta", "64:31", "you went back to that place that you", "64:33",

"because the way you know he came in at", "65:35", "the very end", "65:36", "because he wanted to know what the heck", "65:38", "had taken out", "65:40", "three of his pack he wanted like it's", "65:43", "almost like he's like i know we're", "65:44", "getting out of here but i want to see", "65:46", "this for myself", "65:47", "because you know they were close enough", "65:49", "but i don't

lot of you know", "68:17", "the more you're in the outdoors and you", "68:18", "experience things demeanors and", "68:22", "their uh their ability to survive you", "68:24", "know you look at a", "68:25", "one of the you look at an old grizzly", "68:27", "that's been in those woods for", "68:29", "20 years think of the experience level", "68:32", "that thing has", "68:33", "surviving every single day", "68:36", "i mean every day just maybe making a", "68:40", "slight mistake", "68:41", "slipping up a little bit almost getting", "68:43", "jacked by another grizzly and then", "68:45", "you're like oh", "68:45", "yep i know not to do this i know not to", "68:48", "do that i mean they're", "68:49", "they're intel their intelligence level", "68:51", "and their ability to function is", "68:53", "extremely high and", "68:54", "and wolves are i mean arguably wolves", "68:57", "probably get", "68:58", "shot less than probably any of the other", "69:01", "animals i mean they're", "69:02", "in they are incredibly smart", "69:05", "so yeah i wouldn't i wouldn't doubt it", "69:07", "you know it was um", "69:09", "and they're they they were very after", "69:12", "that they were very", "69:13", "um intent in that area for people to", "69:17", "they put up some pretty big bounties on", "69:19", "the wolves and they really went after", "69:21", "them and", "69:22", "and knocked those herds down quite a bit", "69:24", "because", "69:25", "there was very few mule deer like very", "69:28", "few mule deer", "69:29", "you'd hardly see a doe and fawn they had", "69:31", "to cut the number of tags way down", "69:34", "uh elk as soon as wolves like howl at", "69:37", "night if a pack moves into an area and", "69:39", "they howl", "69:40", "like calling elk is just non-existent", "69:43", "they just", "69:43", "everything's just like don't say nothing", "69:46", "because", "69:47", "you know they're here um so yeah i think", "69:50", "i think them thinning them down was was", "69:52", "very", "69:53", "relevant and since then which was quite", "69:56", "a while ago", "69:57", "um the numbers of like elk and moose", "70:01", "like this past year i saw way more moose", "70:03", "than i've seen", "70:04", "i think they're really hard on moose", "70:06", "fawns", "70:06", "[Music]", "70:08", "and yeah i mean moose", "70:11", "muleys whitetails i saw way more animals", "70:14", "this year", "70:15", "uh than in the past up there and i think", "70:17", "it's just because that", "70:18", "moose number or the wolf number was just", "70:21", "much", "70:21", "lower but there was like i said there", "70:24", "was", "70:24", "still sign that there was some in the", "70:26", "area just nothing like", "70:28", "several years ago when i was there it", "70:30", "was you know", "70:31", "it was even i would say as much as i", "70:34", "appreciate balance", "70:35", "in nature it was excessive", "70:39", "and it's getting that way now like even", "70:41", "in wisconsin", "70:42", "i remember i was talking to a friend of", "70:44", "mine up in an area i used to live up by", "70:47", "kind of in the lacrosse area actually", "70:48", "lived a little northeast of la crosse by", "70:50", "a small town called cataract", "70:53", "and there was a few times where there", "70:56", "were some wolf spottings", "70:58", "um there's a big military base here", "70:59", "called fort mccoy", "71:01", "and i lived up on the northern side of", "71:03", "the base what was called the impact area", "71:05", "they kind of shot test rounds over and", "71:08", "they kind of", "71:09", "i don't know went off there or whatever", "71:10", "but there was an incredible number of", "71:13", "like deer and things that were in there", "71:15", "so", "71:16", "you know kind of the rumor was that they", "71:18", "had introduced wolves", "71:19", "into their timberwolves to let to kind", "71:22", "of thin down some of those numbers well", "71:24", "now it's the point where the amount of", "71:25", "people i know in wisconsin that see", "71:27", "wolves is just rapidly increasing and", "71:30", "obviously when that happens", "71:32", "you know they eat stuff i mean wolves", "71:35", "don't mess around they take stuff down", "71:37", "and", "71:37", "sometimes it's just strange you don't", "71:39", "understand the balance of", "71:41", "um of why there's an introduction to", "71:44", "something that", "71:45", "you know has the possibility to just", "71:47", "take over", "71:48", "you know it's it's strange well it is", "71:51", "but it's also", "71:52", "there needs to be some sort of balance", "71:53", "you don't want the animals", "71:56", "overpopulating and you do want some sort", "71:58", "of a balance between predator and prey", "72:01", "but the real problem becomes when people", "72:04", "don't want to manage the predators", "72:06", "right they only want they want nature to", "72:09", "sort itself out yeah it doesn't really", "72:12", "work that way though", "72:13", "yeah i mean it just people need to", "72:15", "understand like if you do like deer and", "72:17", "you like moose and you like all these", "72:19", "other animals", "72:20", "you can't have too many wolves", "72:23", "too many yeah you can't have too many", "72:25", "grizzlies because if you do", "72:26", "you're going to have very few of those", "72:28", "other animals you're not going to see", "72:29", "them they're going to get wiped out", "72:31", "and in some places like they're almost", "72:33", "at the point of extinction like", "72:35", "what that what what is that caribou herd", "72:37", "that's in north america", "72:39", "one small caribou herd yeah i'm not that", "72:41", "familiar with it because i've never", "72:42", "really been", "72:45", "a caribou person you know from a hunting", "72:47", "aspect", "72:48", "but they're an animal that's like", "72:49", "severely targeted by wolves", "72:52", "oh yeah yeah i could see it anything", "72:53", "with a very predictable migration is", "72:56", "going to be", "72:56", "very prone to you know to any type of", "72:59", "prey creature you look at", "73:01", "you look at any of the migrations of", "73:03", "like wildebeests and stuff like that in", "73:05", "africa where they're having to migrate", "73:07", "it's like those crocs are just like oh", "73:09", "yeah here we go", "73:10", "we know where that river crossing is we", "73:12", "know where the neck down is", "73:14", "it's the same thing it's caribou you", "73:16", "know i'm sure you know this but many", "73:18", "people don't", "73:18", "uh the females actually have antlers and", "73:20", "the reason why they have antlers is to", "73:22", "fend off wolves", "73:23", "i didn't know that yeah female caribou", "73:26", "have antlers", "73:27", "yeah they're one of the only deer", "73:28", "species where the females have antlers", "73:30", "yeah i didn't know i'm sure that's make", "73:31", "sure that's true i don't think", "73:33", "well i mean i guess i'm sure it is i", "73:34", "guess if it's for wolves but", "73:36", "they all have antlers right all caribou", "73:38", "have antlers", "73:39", "well you're male 1 i didn't think so but", "73:42", "i think they do", "73:45", "how good was uh how good was that elk", "73:49", "from that you cooked in camp oh", "73:51", "fantastic is that true", "73:53", "i'm right yeah you're usually right", "73:57", "people would disagree i'd say eight out", "74:00", "of 10 times", "74:01", "there's a few times where i say things", "74:02", "though and i go what the fuck are you", "74:04", "saying you know what you're saying", "74:06", "at least you at least you uh questioned", "74:08", "it yeah you questioned it", "74:09", "always and you laugh about it yeah no", "74:11", "i'm no expert i'm an expert in very very", "74:14", "few things", "74:16", "but uh i think you have very uh your", "74:18", "intelligence level is high", "74:20", "it just says that males are tend to be a", "74:21", "little bit bigger yeah their antlers are", "74:23", "a little bit bigger but yeah they both", "74:24", "have them", "74:25", "yeah um see if it's true that the the", "74:27", "females have it to fend off wolves", "74:29", "i think that's theoretical actually yeah", "74:30", "yeah that's the part that that's the", "74:33", "part where i was like yeah", "74:34", "well i'm pretty sure i saw that in a", "74:37", "documentary", "74:38", "that the females have it to fend off", "74:40", "wolves", "74:42", "that was speculative speculation 360", "74:45", "videos", "74:46", "oh what a cool animal man they're so", "74:48", "cool looking there", "74:49", "i've never hunted them i would like to", "74:51", "they're supposed to be delicious", "74:53", "and there's a shitload of them like", "74:55", "that's the crazy thing about", "74:57", "alaska the areas of alaska like they'll", "74:59", "have hundreds and hundreds of them", "75:01", "and these streams you know i think more", "75:04", "than that", "75:05", "depending on the migration yeah sure but", "75:07", "um", "75:08", "not streams you know whatever a path", "75:10", "full of them there's one with no antlers", "75:11", "must have lost them", "75:12", "do they lose their antlers like all of", "75:15", "them have them it says there are", "75:16", "exceptions like there's only one", "75:17", "this one still got jacked but you see", "75:20", "elk like that", "75:21", "yeah yeah we see that um", "75:24", "yours had a broken tine didn't it uh a", "75:27", "little one", "75:27", "yeah not not a big broken one but we saw", "75:30", "one that i almost shot that", "75:32", "only had one antler yeah you like that", "75:34", "when you were with me and you shot that", "75:35", "one whitetail i'm like he's broken on", "75:37", "one side you're like i want a gangster", "75:40", "they're going down it doesn't bother me", "75:43", "the antlers to me a secondary number one", "75:46", "i want the meat", "75:47", "yeah and i want a mature animal but two", "75:50", "it doesn't bother me if they're things", "75:52", "snapped off it means they're just going", "75:53", "to war yeah you know", "75:55", "i was uh i was really pumped for that", "75:57", "camp specifically because", "75:59", "i had several good friends there and i", "76:02", "really", "76:03", "you know i'm just geeked out right now", "76:05", "about cooking", "76:06", "you know me too just i mean cooking", "76:08", "stuff doing stuff different", "76:10", "um that neck that you made exactly oh my", "76:13", "god i have to figure", "76:15", "you got to give me that recipe and i got", "76:16", "to figure out how to do that that was", "76:18", "sensational man that was so good that", "76:20", "roast yeah we had 51 people", "76:23", "well there's a lot of camera people", "76:25", "there there was guides", "76:27", "there was i think people that maybe", "76:29", "worked there", "76:31", "but yeah i made a massive i took the", "76:34", "one half of the elk neck", "76:37", "and did a forward sear so you know we've", "76:41", "talked about reverse here that our buddy", "76:42", "chad ward taught us", "76:44", "um but this was a i call it a forwards", "76:46", "here maybe i'm wrong but it's just a", "76:47", "sear", "76:47", "yeah so i see her at the beginning uh", "76:50", "in a big cast iron pot we had a massive", "76:52", "cast iron pot barely didn't even fit in", "76:55", "the traeger", "76:56", "and so we seared that whole neck and", "76:59", "then", "77:00", "seasoned it really well i seasoned it", "77:02", "with like a", "77:03", "a trigger prime rib rub and then a", "77:05", "coffee rub", "77:06", "and then i put some of the black rifle", "77:09", "knocked and loaded", "77:10", "coffee in there and then put in", "77:13", "i think about it it was the pot was so", "77:17", "massive but i put in about", "77:19", "six cups of bone broth and", "77:22", "then covered it with a cast iron lid", "77:25", "uh wrapped it all up in foil and then", "77:28", "cooked it at 225", "77:30", "i think for about 18 hours because of", "77:32", "how big it was", "77:33", "and then we knew it was about ready to", "77:36", "be done", "77:36", "so we grilled some peppers", "77:40", "and i think is that all we put in there", "77:42", "grilled a bunch of peppers and stuff", "77:44", "yeah it was like bell peppers yep bell", "77:46", "peppers and um", "77:47", "normally i do some jalapenos too we", "77:49", "didn't have any and then put onions in", "77:51", "there too", "77:51", "i feel like yeah maybe some carrots or", "77:53", "something in there too well there was", "77:54", "there was onions we did grill some", "77:56", "onions", "77:57", "kind of until they were caramelized but", "77:59", "then open that up and", "78:01", "more or less just took two forks and it", "78:02", "just fell apart yeah", "78:04", "i mean just fell apart and kind of did", "78:06", "it all it looked like", "78:07", "it looked like a pulled pork butt is", "78:09", "what it looked like and then we went", "78:10", "ahead and put in all the", "78:12", "the

"85:54", "things i can tell you", "85:55", "are most important is one just recognize", "85:58", "that you know it runs off a wooden", "85:59", "pellet so", "86:01", "treat pellet like treat the pellets like", "86:03", "you would campfire wood you know if", "86:05", "you're", "86:05", "if you leave campfire wood out where", "86:07", "it's getting rained on all the time", "86:09", "you know it's going to be a pain to", "86:11", "start it or it's not going to burn that", "86:12", "grate so if you keep those dry", "86:14", "i always put my pellets after i pour the", "86:16", "bag in

and", "86:43", "you're using the grill that's one thing", "86:44", "but don't keep the", "86:46", "the bags of them out there all the time", "86:48", "and then", "86:49", "as you use it there's the little it's", "86:51", "called a i think they call it a burning", "86:53", "pot essentially your pellets are burning", "86:54", "in a small pot", "86:56", "uh think of that just the same as you", "86:58", "would a campfire pit", "87:00", "as you're burning wood all the time", "87:01", "there's going to be ash left and", "87:04", "if that pot fills up with ash there's", "87:06", "not going to be the ability for", "87:08", "as much pellets to go in there so it's", "87:10", "not going to burn as hot", "87:11", "so you know if you get to the point", "87:13", "where you're not", "87:15", "able to get to your higher temperatures", "87:17", "it's probably because you have too much", "87:18", "you've got too much ash in your pot so", "87:21", "yeah", "87:22", "clean it out and then it'll", "87:25", "pretty much from there be as easy as", "87:26", "flipping it to on and turning it to the", "87:29", "to the temperature that you want it's", "87:30", "done yeah i was telling you that i tried", "87:32", "cooking on a regular grill or propane", "87:34", "grill the other day", "87:35", "and it just sucked it was flaring up", "87:37", "there's you know", "87:38", "fire and smoke because the fat was", "87:41", "dripping down into the fire", "87:43", "it's a shitty way of cooking they do", "87:45", "have a really cool grill though that", "87:46", "cooks from above", "87:48", "i've seen one of those it's pretty bad", "87:50", "ass like you you", "87:52", "uh you can raise or lower the heat and", "87:55", "bring it closer to the meat", "87:57", "or lift it above and so you don't get", "87:59", "any flare-ups it just cooks from above", "88:01", "well it's definitely a better way to do", "88:02", "it if you're using propane because i", "88:04", "i remember i remember once i bought some", "88:08", "some rib eyes and this was back when i", "88:10", "didn't have the money to buy", "88:12", "good steaks but i had some people over", "88:13", "and i thought i'm gonna buy some good", "88:14", "steaks went out and", "88:16", "you know spit quite a bit getting some", "88:18", "good rib eyes and everything", "88:20", "and because there's so much marbling i", "88:21", "remember i came inside", "88:23", "i had those on the grill i didn't even", "88:26", "have them that high for temperature i", "88:27", "came", "88:28", "inside and i you know started working on", "88:29", "vegetables or pouring drinks for people", "88:31", "and also i look out and there's just", "88:33", "smoke", "88:34", "rolling out of my weber and i go out", "88:36", "there and lift it up", "88:37", "and my rib eyes all that marbling just", "88:39", "it was just a big", "88:41", "burning mess it looked like i took a", "88:43", "flamethrower to one half of my rib eyes", "88:45", "i was", "88:45", "so bummed out yeah it's hard doing it", "88:47", "right yeah that's there's an art to", "88:49", "cooking", "88:50", "there is one of the things that i'm", "88:52", "really uh", "88:53", "learning from getting into hunting and", "88:55", "getting into cooking my own food", "88:57", "is uh learning how to do it correctly", "88:59", "and it's fun there's a real art to it", "89:01", "you know", "89:01", "like like that necros that you made or", "89:04", "like some of the more interesting things", "89:05", "do you ever do shanks yeah yeah i did um", "89:09", "i did two last week yeah um i shot that", "89:13", "whitetail in south dakota", "89:16", "and i took both of the front quarters", "89:18", "and then", "89:19", "did slow cooks with those and they're", "89:22", "they're awesome", "89:23", "you know the key for any of that stuff", "89:25", "that normally has a lot of tendons and", "89:27", "stuff that's a tougher", "89:28", "section of the meat a lot of people try", "89:31", "to cook them too fast", "89:32", "and you don't break down that cartilage", "89:34", "you know you need that cartilage to", "89:36", "really cook slow to the point where it", "89:39", "like gels", "89:40", "and it breaks down and it almost turns", "89:42", "into marbling and", "89:43", "then it'll turn into flavoring which is", "89:45", "kind of what happened with that", "89:46", "with the neck you know once it cooks", "89:49", "slow enough", "89:49", "even all those harder tendons that are", "89:51", "in there they just", "89:53", "slowly start decomposing they become", "89:54", "like more of a marbling that's mixed in", "89:57", "and it's really really good i mean it's", "90:00", "it's", "90:00", "awesome and i'm i'm a big", "90:04", "advocate on the simpler you keep things", "90:06", "cooking wise", "90:07", "for me the better the flavors are that i", "90:10", "get i'm a very", "90:11", "simple cook and when people ask me to do", "90:15", "you know people see pictures that i post", "90:17", "cooking they're like well", "90:19", "you know you need to do a cookbook no", "90:20", "i'm not my cookbook would be boring", "90:23", "because it would be", "90:24", "you know olive oil probably you know i", "90:27", "would have", "90:28", "coffee for rub and have like a prime rib", "90:30", "rub", "90:31", "you know probably a decent like rock", "90:32", "salt but other than that like grass-fed", "90:35", "butters", "90:36", "olive oils or a couple basic rubs that's", "90:39", "all i use period in a bone broth if i do", "90:42", "like a", "90:43", "if i cook something slow to break down", "90:45", "but", "90:46", "i just literally stay with those staple", "90:49", "things", "90:49", "and from there you know i'll cook", "90:52", "according to the directions", "90:53", "one of the things i learned to do was", "90:55", "was rest my meat", "90:57", "so i won't take meat off and just cut", "90:59", "right into it", "91:00", "and you rest it in a cooler yeah i rest", "91:02", "in a yeti all the time", "91:04", "all the time you cover it with aluminum", "91:06", "foil and it works your paper", "91:08", "when you do it like do you get it to a", "91:10", "certain temperature like say if you want", "91:11", "your", "91:11", "your meat to hit an internal temperature", "91:13", "like 130. do you get it to like 120 and", "91:16", "then put in the cooler and then let it", "91:17", "rise", "91:18", "to like 130 while it's in there because", "91:20", "it keeps cooking right yeah it's gonna", "91:22", "it's gonna rise some yeah it will rise", "91:24", "some", "91:25", "you gotta plan that out before you rest", "91:27", "it too if you're gonna do it in a cooler", "91:28", "right", "91:29", "yeah normally i it depends how long", "91:32", "you're going to rest it", "91:33", "um normally i plan on about six degrees", "91:35", "it'll go up", "91:37", "but you can as you're resting it in the", "91:39", "cooler you can still check it you know", "91:40", "you can let it sit for 10 or 15 minutes", "91:43", "and then check it", "91:44", "normally for me 5 degrees is a really", "91:46", "good number like", "91:47", "i'll stop 5 degrees less than where i", "91:49", "want to eat it", "91:50", "because when i put it in there and wrap", "91:52", "it up most vegetables for me take", "91:54", "20 minutes like as soon as i pull that", "91:56", "off my traeger", "91:58", "i'll turn it up to high and then", "92:01", "take vegetables i just like toss in", "92:03", "olive oil and i'll season them with a", "92:05", "basic rub", "92:06", "put them in there but anything like", "92:07", "broccoli asparagus peppers", "92:10", "cauliflower anything like that that i", "92:12", "cook on there is going to take", "92:14", "20 minutes roughly on high and the meat", "92:16", "is just resting at that point", "92:18", "and then i can literally pull the meat", "92:20", "off if i want to do reverse here i can", "92:22", "do it just", "92:23", "long enough to where that temperature", "92:25", "hits the exact number if it hadn't", "92:27", "reached that yet", "92:28", "otherwise i can just slice it and", "92:30", "according to you know the color", "92:32", "throughout that i'll serve it out to", "92:34", "everybody according to whether they want", "92:36", "something a little more done you give", "92:37", "them one of the end pieces if people", "92:39", "want it less done you give them the", "92:40", "piece in the middle", "92:41", "but typically if i'm going to let it", "92:43", "rest for 20 minutes i'll pull it at", "92:44", "about", "92:45", "you know 129 degrees because i like mine", "92:47", "at like 135 or so", "92:50", "you like yours a little less you like", "92:51", "yours a little you know redder than me i", "92:53",
