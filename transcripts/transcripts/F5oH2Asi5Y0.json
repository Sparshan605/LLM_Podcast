said the thing they were taught", "91:03", "first is because all they walk around", "91:05", "there's only like maybe 30 guards at a", "91:06", "time on", "91:07", "Judy and what six hundred to a thousand", "91:10", "prisoners right depending on what the", "91:13", "circumstances are and all they have is a", "91:14", "big metal keyring and they're taught the", "91:16", "first thing you fuckin do is punch a", "91:18", "dude right in his fucking throat yeah if", "91:20", "you feel like you're any kind of thing", "91:21", "that's the and he told me that like that", "91:23", "he was like if I was going to give you", "91:24", "any advice and you felt like you were", "91:25", "fucking it's like the first thing you do", "91:27", "and I and he explained it well enough", "91:29", "that I noon as even as a young man like", "91:31", "you're playing with a person's life", "91:33", "punching them in the fucking Adam's", "91:34", "apple or something you know you would", "91:36", "kill them with my soul like he was that", "91:37", "you would with that we even just put", "91:39", "your fist if you hit him right you would", "91:41", "be amazed you're amazing how much damage", "91:43", "people could take actually I'd rather", "91:44", "get punched in the Adam's apple then I", "91:46", "would get kicked in the side of my head", "91:48", "like around here because this is what", "91:50", "shuts you off it seems like again many", "91:54", "things can shut you off just with the", "91:55", "caveat like you can get shut off with a", "91:57", "kick even almost like to the top of your", "92:00", "chest it snaps your head back so much", "92:02", "you get shut off but there's something", "92:04", "about neck kicks like button do just go", "92:07", "they just crumple do and sometimes they", "92:09", "crumple from chin shots but I think it's", "92:12", "the same thing I think what the chin", "92:13", "shot is doing is somehow another", "92:15", "pinching the garden hose that is the", "92:18", "spine and shutting the system off it's", "92:21", "also if I'm not mistaken your viewing", "92:23", "your brain sits in that little bit of", "92:24", "fluid and if so your skull moves I've", "92:26", "asked enough the brain doesn't move as", "92:28", "fast and it touches the once brain", "92:30", "touches the skull that's lights-out", "92:31", "that's that absolutely - also I think", "92:34", "the same principle like rear naked choke", "92:37", "and head kick knockouts are not the same", "92:41", "in that a rear naked choke is way safer", "92:43", "like if you get choked unconscious", "92:44", "you're going to be fine if you get head", "92:47", "kicked unconscious you got to take some", "92:49", "time off or you get just got fucked up", "92:51", "but the mechanism behind them is kind of", "92:54", "similar in that it's cutting off the", "92:57", "circuitry not like specifically because", "92:59", "the choke is like stopping the blood but", "93:01", "the head kick is just jolting like it's", "93:04", "like rebooting your computer head kick I", "93:05", "would imagine I've never experienced it", "93:07", "nor can I throw one that high but I", "93:10", "would imagine why it might be worse is", "93:12", "because I got you get punch and it's the", "93:13", "motion of the head almost and the brain", "93:16", "not moving that is causing the knockout", "93:18", "if you get kicked like this it's a shin", "93:20", "it's", "93:21", "your head doesn't get to move so the", "93:22", "brain is actually getting slammed", "93:24", "against the other side of the fucking", "93:25", "skull I've made this point really", "93:27", "recently and even yesterday I think", "93:29", "people should have no gloves on when", "93:30", "they fight I think fighting with gloves", "93:32", "is it makes it easier to punch people", "93:34", "which is more uh more unrealistic and", "93:36", "getting kicked in the head is way worse", "93:39", "than getting punched in the head it's", "93:40", "like that argument for Olympic headgear", "93:42", "that's why it's going away causes more", "93:44", "problems it's actually worth at this", "93:46", "point I also think it's unrealistic in", "93:48", "terms of like the limitations of your", "93:49", "body like there's limitations of your", "93:51", "body with punching people and that's", "93:52", "that your wrists Bend like anybody's", "93:55", "ever punched someone or with you can", "93:56", "don't tape or Jenelle raw no no I are", "93:59", "that's yeah raw because taped is really", "94:02", "what the problem is when you tape this", "94:03", "wrist like so well that I can't really", "94:06", "fuck it up I'm gonna I'm gonna throw it", "94:07", "with abandon well also it's like no", "94:09", "abandon you right you can if you can", "94:12", "tape here's no offended with no abandon", "94:14", "I don't think there's anything wrong", "94:15", "with two people agreeing with like a", "94:18", "rule set like they agree okay we're", "94:19", "going to wear gloves and we're going to", "94:21", "wear keep pants like things along those", "94:22", "lines but like if you can wear gloves", "94:25", "gloves for a
