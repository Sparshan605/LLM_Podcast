they", "07:09", "likely to have working for them what is", "07:12", "likely to happen in courts what is", "07:14", "likely to happen regulation wise and so", "07:17", "of course you want to think

have made", "07:46", "like interest like maybe this person", "07:48", "could be the next great president maybe", "07:50", "this person could be a great leader but", "07:52", "now we're in this position we're like oh", "07:54", "god okay so listen we're voting for the", "07:56", "cabinet okay like Biden is so he's", "07:59", "whether or not he's having moments that", "08:04", "are related to cognitive decline which", "08:06", "he could speculate or whether or not", "08:08", "this is just his reaction to the most", "08:10", "extreme amount of pressure he's ever", "08:12", "faced in his

would would be able to handle", "08:23", "stuff but I think running for president", "08:26", "is a whole different ball game I think", "08:27", "everything gets turned up by 10:00 and I", "08:29", "think it gets turned up in this society", "08:31", "that we're experiencing today it gets", "08:33", "turned up even more so because of social", "08:35", "media like no president other than Trump",

"08:56", "the first guy to tackle it head-on and", "08:58", "he's you know in a lot of ways he's", "09:01", "showing you what can come at you and I", "09:04", "think that when Biden is running through", "09:07", "these steps to try to become president", "09:09", "he's experiencing a wave of attention", "09:12", "and scrutiny that he's never experienced", "09:14", "before and that could also exacerbate", "09:16", "what a my doctor here I'm exam I'm", "09:18", "trying to figure out what's wrong with", "09:19", "his head but that could are you have you", "09:22", "taken a position on the Biden cognitive", "09:25", "stuff that something's wrong something's", "09:27", "wrong he was my friend he was fighting", "09:29", "I'd ask him to retire I mean if I'm", "09:31", "looking at that way I have friends that", "09:34", "I've seen their cognitive decline from", "09:37", "fighting I'm not saying that Biden is", "09:40", "the same so I don't really know him from", "09:41", "you know I don't know him over a long", "09:43", "period time I don't know him at all", "09:44", "personally but something's wrong the way", "09:47", "on any of your friends that are they", "09:50", "close to 80 any of them", "09:52", "no no because the kind of decline of", "09:55", "younger guys have been hit in the head", "09:56", "yeah when you get to 80 I have known", "10:01", "people that have had problems and it's", "10:02", "it's very unfortunate I don't think he's", "10:05", "there", "10:06", "where would I you know because he could", "10:07", "still talk to him like if that was just", "10:10", "a guy that you knew and he was like and", "10:12", "he said something like who we've all", "10:14", "been endowed by you know the thing", "10:17", "though that one famous beat you see you", "10:20", "wouldn't say oh Jesus what's going on", "10:22", "with Rey he would say oh yeah damn you", "10:23", "locked up he had a brain fart he had a", "10:26", "mental lapse which I've had doing", "10:29", "podcasts all the time it can happen but", "10:31", "in that moment in front of those people", "10:34", "to do it that way while he's running for", "10:36", "president and why he's had a few of", "10:37", "those before he could be dealing with", "10:38", "anxiety too there's probably a lot of", "10:40", "shit going on but I would be concerned", "10:42", "yeah I mean listen so I I don't have any", "10:45", "I don't my view is just based on actual", "10:48", "professionals that I've talked to and", "10:50", "people that have been in a room with him", "10:51", "because I've I'm not a professional and", "10:53", "I've not been in the room with Biden", "10:55", "so Andrew Yang was on with Sam Harris", "10:57", "recently I don't know if you saw and", "10:59", "this topic came up and Andrew yang", "11:01", "basically said", "11:03", "listen he's 78 years old if you compare", "11:05", "a video of Biden debating Paul Ryan in", "11:08", "2012 to Biden a month ago obviously it's", "11:11", "different and to some degree you that's", "11:14", "normal when someone's 78 years old yeah", "11:17", "but Andrew Yang's perspective was that", "11:19", "he didn't see anything that he would", "11:21", "call a dementia or cognitive decline", "11:23", "beyond that so that's like one it's just", "11:26", "one data point it doesn't tell us", "11:27", "anything definitively you know the other", "11:29", "thing is I've interviewed a few people", "11:31", "and I think you and I maybe have even", "11:33", "messaged about some of them neuroscience", "11:36", "your neurologists and mental health", "11:38", "professionals who were very concerned", "11:40", "about Trump like the oranges of an", "11:42", "investigation the where he is he seems", "11:45", "to sort of like lock up when his", "11:47", "shoulders sort of you know this thing", "11:49", "that he does were his shoulders kind of", "11:51", "a weird way I got video of that you know", "11:55", "he's I mean you think it's a", "11:57", "neurological thing I don't know that's", "11:59", "the thing so it could be neurological", "12:01", "mental health side effect of medication", "12:03", "there's a whole bunch of stuff it could", "12:05", "be could it also be an injury maybe yeah", "12:08", "maybe I mean if he's doing some with his", "12:10", "back or shoulder well it's weird because", "12:13", "he when it happens he has a verbal", "12:17", "mistake that he makes and it coincides", "12:20", "with this shoulder thing and then it's", "12:22", "almost like there's a half second gap", "12:24", "and then someone hits the reset button", "12:26", "and he'll get back on the teleprompter", "12:27", "or whatever it's weird there's like ten", "12:29", "or so examine to see this I need I need", "12:31", "to see this while I'm talking to you um", "12:33", "so Jamie's gonna search for one so what", "12:36", "would he search for um I think if you if", "12:40", "you went to like search.twitter.com and", "12:42", "just searched in videos the way you can", "12:44", "do and you put like Trump brain glitch", "12:46", "I'm guessing that some of these would uh", "12:49", "come up but the the the gist of what I", "12:52", "was getting to was some of these same", "12:54", "neurologists and mental health folks", "12:56", "when I asked them privately about Biden", "12:59", "and say to you are you seeing like the", "13:01", "same type of thing they all say no so", "13:03", "again it's like it's a different view", "13:05", "they're hardcore Hammond's that's I", "13:07", "don't know waiting long dance", "13:08", "yes had these moments were for sure", "13:11", "something doesn't look", "13:12", "right I agree totally great so why would", "13:15", "they say any differently they've gotta", "13:17", "be Democrats they've got to be hardcore", "13:18", "party loyalists III think that to assume", "13:21", "that absent any evidence is maybe unfair", "13:23", "yeah it is but I'm an unfair guy in some", "13:27", "some respects but here's my thought on", "13:29", "this right now so like what let's", "13:32", "imagine that Biden's having a real", "13:34", "problem right it's absolutely for real", "13:37", "I'm still voting for him over Trump", "13:39", "right I mean like so I I think last time", "13:42", "we talked you mentioned you were", "13:43", "pro-choice do I remember that right oh", "13:44", "yeah yeah", "13:45", "so I I felt like it's a it's a", "13:48", "controversial subject for a wreath there", "13:50", "bear yeah if Donald Trump gets to pick", "13:53", "the next Supreme Court justice it will", "13:56", "be someone who would love to overturn", "13:59", "roe v-- wade I mean there's not even a", "14:01", "chance he said it right this is will try", "14:04", "trumpet said that he is that he's", "14:06", "pro-life and that he picks up on that", "14:09", "would or it was just by virtue of", "14:11", "picking conservative there's there it's", "14:13", "it's actually it's there's two parts to", "14:14", "it one is Donald Trump was pro-choice", "14:16", "almost his entire life he came pro-life", "14:19", "when he was I think 68 because he met a", "14:21", "kid he liked and he imagined if that kid", "14:24", "wasn't born no I'm serious", "14:25", "I believe you it's just hilarious it's", "14:28", "crazy it's like an ABC after-school", "14:30", "special let's imagine that that's true", "14:33", "that he had an awakening at age 68 after", "14:35", "being pro-life his whole life yeah he", "14:37", "said he would pick justices that were", "14:40", "recommended to him by I forget which", "14:42", "conservative group you're only gonna get", "14:44", "you know Pro so-called the pro-life", "14:46", "justices from these groups mm-hmm on the", "14:49", "other hand Joe Biden will absolutely", "14:51", "pick a pro-choice justice so if I was", "14:54", "road choice like you are how do I", "14:57", "justify voting for the guy who's gonna", "14:59", "replace potentially Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "15:02", "with someone who would want roe v wade", "15:04", "overturned like I couldn't do it in good", "15:06", "conscience that's that's a good point", "15:07", "well I'm gonna get into it in a second", "15:09", "but Jamie just pulled up this video of", "15:10", "Trump and I'm gonna get a watch him have", "15:13", "this weird twitch for the first time", "15:15", "okay I'd hit me with it Jamie okay so", "15:19", "he's talking", "15:27", "I'm watching it is that it that would", "15:31", "have moved that he made oh this is", "15:33", "hilarious and silly trumped", "15:35", "neurologically malfunctions with a full", "15:37", "spasm no he's talking he just want like", "15:39", "this people do that that's silly maybe", "15:42", "so maybe that yeah I don't know I", "15:45", "couldn't hear that a better thing is", "15:47", "something that you showed me on your", "15:48", "show a better example when there was", "15:51", "real problems with him enunciate in", "15:53", "words and you know there was speculation", "15:56", "like was he falling so was he sick it", "15:59", "was it was he on a sedative was it was", "16:01", "something something going wrong it", "16:03", "almost seemed like his tongue wasn't", "16:05", "working correctly right yeah he was", "16:09", "wrestling with with a paralyzed tongue", "16:12", "respective matches mine but I think I",

for", "16:25", "me to know who it is I'm gonna vote for", "16:27", "I guess is the point I'm trying to make", "16:29", "it's it's fascinating that pro-choice is", "16:33", "such a hard-line issue on

hours", "56:43", "it might have been January 1920 or vice", "56:45", "versa but there was a point in late", "56:47", "March or early April where South Korea", "56:50", "had as many positive tests in a day as", "56:54", "we did pests total hmm so this is really", "56:58", "important to understand that the", "56:59", "discrepancy here they there was a day", "57:01", "where we like a state eight hundred", "57:03", "people in the United States and they did", "57:05", "so many tests that they had 800 positive", "57:08", "cases and so the the the slow testing", "57:12", "response is a disaster

wasn't there there was", "57:41", "some sort of a pandemic department that", "57:43", "was people were moved out of that", "57:45", "department and it sort of was absorbed", "57:47", "yes so there's so there's video of this", "57:51", "it's so funny because Trump was asked", "57:53", "about this at a press briefing a couple", "57:54", "months ago this is when Anthony foul she", "57:56", "was

"58:13", "god get back to our cognitive decline", "58:15", "thing is it possible Trump literally had", "58:18", "no memory of that when he was asked", "58:20", "about it a couple months ago maybe yes", "58:22", "there is here's why here's why yeah my", "58:24", "brain my memories going to shit and I", "58:27", "think one of the reason why my memories", "58:28", "going to shit as I do too many things I", "58:30", "have too many podcasts going there's too", "58:31", "many subjects I'm researching too many", "58:34", "different topics for future guests and I", "58:37", "really feel like you

people's names and", "59:16", "addresses you just needed a hundred and", "59:17", "fifty of them I think that's the case", "59:19", "with everything and I think when you see", "59:21", "a guy like

think", "59:58", "I go what's that money what's happening", "60:00", "over there that's one more thing it's", "60:03", "one more unit of the mental bandwidth", "60:05", "that you have this fucking guy's taxed", "60:07", "out he's taxed out with just the", "60:09", "arguments that he's getting with the", "60:11", "press just think about how much that's", "60:13", "how much real estate that's taking up in", "60:15", "his head right and then you think about", "60:16", "the disease you thinking about", "60:18", "restarting the economy you think about", "60:20", "he very well might not

disbanded it in 2018", "60:31", "and he sort of bragged that hey you know", "60:34", "we're not gonna do stuff where we don't", "60:36", "need these people we just thought", "60:38", "they're not really doing much so we just", "60:39", "we don't really need them so he did do", "60:41", "that whoops is this thing that this", "60:42", "thing about the press though you know", "60:46", "and he's busy with between the press and", "60:47", "the virus and reopening and all this", "60:49", "different stuff I don't know if you saw", "60:50", "the reports that he often gets into what", "60:53", "we would call work like at noon or later", "60:54", "after watching like five or even more", "60:57", "hours of TV and tweeting it doesn't", "61:00", "strike me that he's that busy with", "61:01", "actual work I think he is and he isn't I", "61:05", "think he it's still taking up bandwidth", "61:07", "in his head but look it is so American", "61:11", "that he does that you know I'm saying I", "61:13", "mean not the best way possible but it's", "61:16", "so we're so comical in so many ways that", "61:19", "our president", "61:20", "he's eating junk food and watching TV", "61:23", "and tweeting angry tweeting of people", "61:25", "always watching Fox News it's so so okay", "61:29", "here's the point I want to make about", "61:31", "that okay one of the things that scares", "61:34", "me about the way that this president is", "61:37", "sometimes covered by sometimes it's", "61:41", "people who call themselves centrist or", "61:43", "sometimes it's people who say I'm just", "61:46", "I'm just reporting facts and not giving", "61:48", "an opinion or whatever one of the things", "61:49", "that really scares me is that this is", "61:52", "being treated like a normal presidency", "61:54", "when as you're pointing out it's really", "61:56", "not a normal presidency and the analogy", "61:59", "that I would sort of apply to it would", "62:01", "like imagine that you're doing UFC", "62:03", "commentary and I'm really I'm going I", "62:04", "dislike me going out on a limb because", "62:06", "this is not my area of expertise but", "62:08", "let's see if the analogy will work", "62:10", "imagine that one of the fighters comes", "62:13", "in and he at one point tries to light", "62:16", "his opponent on fire and you as a", "62:19", "commentator say this is an unusual", "62:22", "strategy that's very aggressive you're", "62:24", "treating it like it's within the realm", "62:27", "of normality this is a destruction of", "62:30", "the system right like what if it's not", "62:32", "an aggressive strategy this is crazy", "62:34", "right that's incorrect now me it scares", "62:37", "me because I see you know so I like to", "62:40", "use the term enlightened centrist and", "62:42", "it's a little bit pejorative but it's", "62:44", "someone who believes themselves to be", "62:45", "above the fray of the of the bias of the", "62:47", "left/right stuff mm-hmm", "62:49", "where they'll say you know listen yeah", "62:51", "Trump kind of has a different way of", "62:52", "talking about politics but I think he's", "62:55", "pretty good on trade it's like what are", "62:57", "you talking about and that really scares", "62:59", "me because there's like a normalization", "63:01", "going on that's that's crazy well", "63:04", "there's also a thing that we desire as", "63:07", "humans that's for our leaders to exhibit", "63:11", "virtue and and and dignity there's", "63:14", "there's like a thing we expect them to", "63:16", "be a statesman or a state's woman right", "63:18", "you expect them to like Tulsi gabbard's", "63:20", "an excellent example that to me of", "63:22", "someone who who speaks like someone that", "63:26", "I would appreciate addressing the nation", "63:28", "in some sort of a disastrous state like", "63:30", "if something was going wrong I would", "63:31", "want someone who speaks the way she", "63:32", "speaks talking about it you know there's", "63:35", "there's a certain Cuomo has it there's a", "63:37", "certain characteristic that you would", "63:39", "want from someone who is in a position", "63:41", "of leadership like I get a certain", "63:44", "amount of calm out of listening to him", "63:46", "break down the current situations and", "63:48", "what they're doing to remedy and",

on", "63:57", "the planet right it turns to a city I", "63:58", "mean yeah I think so yeah so at this", "64:00", "point it's anywhere on the planet I mean", "64:02", "he's done a remarkable job of exhibiting", "64:05", "all the characteristics whether or not", "64:08", "you think his decisions were correct or", "64:10", "not because there's some real arguments", "64:11", "especially with the early days of", "64:13", "letting", "64:14", "old people go back to nursing homes when", "64:17", "they had tested and that's obviously", "64:19", "horrible but the way he communicates he", "64:23",

"64:30", "why you know a lot of mistakes have been", "64:33", "made during this and a lot of it came", "64:35", "from like your pointing out we had", "64:37", "incomplete information right masks are", "64:39", "good then they don't work it's", "64:40", "transmitted through droplet versus how", "64:42", "much is happening via surfaces and it's", "64:45", "you know dangerous for this group versus", "64:47", "if a lot of mistakes were made because", "64:49", "of lack of information but not everybody", "64:52", "was saying stuff like 15 cases will soon", "64:55", "be 0 anybody who wants a test can

want a", "65:09", "license to go out and act however they", "65:12", "want to act regardless of what the facts", "65:14", "are and that's why it's been so", "65:16", "dangerous to see that stuff well it also", "65:18", "is dangerous because people dismiss some", "65:20", "of the things that he said when he was", "65:21", "talking about like using a UV inside the", "65:25", "body as a disinfectant or using Lysol as", "65:28", "a clay maybe a cleaning he was saying", "65:31", "one of the problems that came out of", "65:32", "this I don't know if you're aware of", "65:33", "this there was a publicly traded biotech", "65:36", "company that had a concept for UV light", "65:39", "that would go in through when someone", "65:42", "was intubated you would go in through", "65:43", "the same

to some degree have it maybe there's", "72:26", "times a day where he's up and sometimes", "72:28", "when he's down like it's not necessarily", "72:31", "stimulants I guess mmm", "72:33", "maybe but he's also a guy who's willing", "72:36", "to take hydroxychloroquine yeah look", "72:40", "he's taking it yes I know we I know many", "72:43", "doctors who are taking it and have asked", "72:46", "me if I want it prescribed to me to take", "72:49", "yeah because they're taking it in very", "72:51", "small doses and I said but my friend had", "72:54", "it when he was my friend Michael yo was",

"73:36", "maybe take stuff you know I'm saying", "73:38", "like doctor prescribes you said do you", "73:41", "remember that article I think you and I", "73:42", "had discussed this", "73:43", "there was a journalist that claimed they", "73:47", "found the very say the right pharmacy", "73:49", "that prescribed Trump speed that were", "73:52", "Trump would pick up this stuff that he", "73:54",

because trumps for it", "76:46", "I've been talking about", "76:47", "hydroxychloroquine longer than Trump I", "76:48", "talked about it 10 days before Trump", "76:50", "ever mentioned it along with seven other", "76:51", "things that we're looking at I don't", "76:53", "care I want you know what works that's", "76:55", "that's my only priority", "76:57", "yeah the reasons I doubted whether Trump", "76:59", "was really taking it were that he", "77:02", "mentioned he seemed confused about how", "77:04", "long he had been on it and what kind of", "77:07", "dose he was getting like at one point it", "77:09", "wasn't clear whether he was getting the", "77:10", "weekly dose which is how it's taken for", "77:12", "malaria or a small daily dose he seemed", "77:14", "confused and then the letter that his", "77:16", "doctor put out didn't actually say he", "77:18", "was taking it it was one of the weirdest", "77:20", "letters I don't know if you saw it where", "77:21", "there's one paragraph which just says we", "77:24", "talked about this drug and determined", "77:26", "the the potential benefits outweigh the", "77:29", "risks or something like that maybe the", "77:30", "dungeon did that because it's off-label", "77:32", "because it is an off-label drug so if he", "77:34", "is prescribing it to Trump it's not", "77:36", "fda-approved who's gonna get in trouble", "77:39", "it's the president I mean I think that's", "77:40", "why they would write the letter was", "77:42", "weird is the point it didn't it said", "77:44", "everything other than Trump is taking it", "77:45", "which is if it's a letter to prove I'm", "77:47", "taking it you would think it would", "77:48", "mention that", "77:49", "well maybe the doctor hesitated and said", "77:52", "it's controversial maybe Trump asked for", "77:54", "it we're going way out on the", "77:55", "speculation yeah I'm here these are thin", "77:57", "branches maybe maybe he said I want to", "78:00", "take it the doctors like wow that's mean", "78:04", "there's some downsides it's like look", "78:06", "I'm gonna get it either way and so he", "78:08", "gets it from another doctor it could be", "78:10", "that I know a guy don't worry about it", "78:11", "I'll call guys front of it tomorrow ask", "78:13", "for the letter the pen is after he", "78:15", "mentioned it and people said is he", "78:17",

"78:25", "why the fuck did you say that I don't", "78:30", "know I don't know it's there's a lot of", "78:32", "speculation I don't think you would", "78:34", "outright lie about that because the", "78:36", "reason being is that I do know people", "78:37", "are taking it and I do know doctors and", "78:40", "I've just discussed it with doctors and", "78:42", "I've even been offered it and I just I", "78:45", "think people are willing to if they", "78:48", "really think there's a possibility of", "78:49", "getting ahead of this thing and some", "78:52", "sort of a preventative measure they'll", "78:54", "take it and especially if you're a type", "78:56", "of person who takes things so do you", "78:59", "think that there's gonna be a period", "79:02", "where wealthier folks with connections", "79:05", "will be able to buy a vaccine before", "79:07", "it's available I think that's a", "79:09", "possibility for sure right don't you", "79:10", "think if there's a small quantity that's", "79:13", "always gonna be the case I mean one", "79:15", "thing that people are getting upset at", "79:16", "me in the early days of the pandemic was", "79:18", "that I was testing everybody that came", "79:20", "into the podcast studio like where you", "79:21", "getting these tests well I'm just buying", "79:23", "them I'm paying for them there's a", "79:25", "concierge service in Los Angeles they", "79:27", "come to you and the doctor will", "79:30", "administer these tests you just have to", "79:32", "pay for it and I understand that people", "79:33", "don't have that money that that sucks", "79:35", "but I'm not going to not do it if I can", "79:38", "so this is a similar situation like I", "79:41", "can understand what people be upset", "79:43", "if you had money and someone came up to", "79:46", "you and said David we have this perfect", "79:48", "vaccine it's absolutely been proven", "79:50", "however only one percent of the", "79:51", "population is going to be able to get it", "79:54", "but if you get it and you and your", "79:55", "family can have it and we'll make sure", "79:58", "you're safe would you not take it", "80:00", "because you wanted other people to have", "80:01", "access to it I think a lot of people who", "80:03", "have access to it would probably say", "80:05", "listen I have to do the right thing for", "80:07", "my family I'm gonna try to help people", "80:08", "get it I'm gonna try to spread the word", "80:10", "and hopefully they'll be okay but I have", "80:12", "to take care of myself right now yeah I", "80:14", "I don't disagree with that I don't", "80:15", "disagree with that it's unfortunate", "80:17", "anybody would ever have to choose that", "80:19", "yeah and how it'll go down I guess it's", "80:21", "a question mark like how will you how", "80:23", "will how will people in the know be made", "80:25", "aware that this is now something they'd", "80:26", "potentially be able to buy are you aware", "80:28", "of I mean look how many different does a", "80:30", "bunch of different trials going on right", "80:32", "now where they're trying to figure out", "80:33", "how to make a vaccine but there's so far", "80:36", "no coronavirus vaccine has ever been", "80:38", "successful right there's not one that", "80:40", "they can use as a model is that correct", "80:42", "there is so there are source", "80:45", "there's coronavirus vaccines that have", "80:48", "worked in poultry from my understanding", "80:50", "which can be modified potentially so I", "80:53", "think at least one or two of the vaccine", "80:55", "candidates are modified poetry", "80:58", "coronavirus vaccines", "80:59", "- that could potentially be used in", "81:02", "humans and the other unique thing about", "81:05", "this vaccine potentially as I understand", "81:08", "it is that this would be if I understand", "81:12", "correctly it would be the first vaccine", "81:15", "of its type that instead of having like", "81:17", "a weakened version of the virus instead", "81:21", "it would be a compound that triggers the", "81:24", "body to create certain proteins if I'm", "81:27", "understanding that correctly it would be", "81:29", "innovative in that sense as well yeah", "81:31", "that was explained to me by Alex Jones", "81:32", "all right okay long conversation with", "81:35", "him about it last night where he use its", "81:37", "an mrna varvakis mRNA vaccine it's a but", "81:42", "there's never been one of those that", "81:43", "successfully been used on humans right", "81:45", "this is a new thing well I don't know", "81:48", "that there's been biologists from what", "81:52", "I've read there's not been an", "81:53", "opportunity like this where", "81:55", "the technology would be near enough", "81:58", "where we would try to make that type of", "82:00", "vaccine versus the traditional kind is", "82:02", "my understanding dude that one sounds", "82:04", "scary I'm gonna wait I don't want to

to", "90:27", "me that that would be a better way to", "90:29", "you walk right into it if it's in the", "90:31", "air but it's particular matter it's in", "90:33", "the air and you're breathing it

better", "109:06", "way they'll take that video down even if", "109:08", "it's someone who's saying rational", "109:10", "things and I yeah I don't think that's", "109:14", "smart I don't think that's a healthy way", "109:16", "to handle things I don't think it's good", "109:17", "for the debate I think in fact it", "109:19", "strengthens the resolve of the people on", "109:21", "the other side

videos is the way to handle it I", "109:30", "think the way to handle it is let other", "109:32", "people with opposing points of view put", "109:34", "their videos up and let people discuss", "109:38", "and debate and see which one makes more", "109:40", "sense to you and usually the weight of", "109:42", "the information overwhelms the bullshit", "109:44", "and at least with most people I

okay so this", "110:00", "this now gets into that part of your", "110:03", "episode with Bridget from over the", "110:04", "weekend that I saw where you basically", "110:06", "accurately characterized the the view", "110:08", "that I had last time I was on with you", "110:10", "about the regulation of social media", "110:11", "yeah so first to play devil's advocate", "110:15", "just for a second on why do you leave up", "110:17", "ladder but take down the you know", "110:21", "coronavirus videos that youtuber whoever", "110:23", "disagrees with one can make an argument", "110:25", "that there is no real action someone", "110:28", "would take because they believe the", "110:30", "earth is flat that would endanger others", "110:32", "I mean I guess you might try to go to", "110:34", "the edge and see if you fall off or", "110:36", "something right like but there's no", "110:38", "actionable thing for the most part that", "110:41", "flatter belief does that's a good point", "110:43", "where is if this disinformation about so", "110:46", "like I'll give you one there was a video", "110:48", "I saw about Crone", "110:49", "virus where there was a doctor saying", "110:50", "you know these quarantines are dangerous", "110:53", "because if you're not exposed to", "110:57", "bacteria your immune system will be out", "111:01", "of practice essentially and it's not is", "111:04", "gonna shut down it's not gonna work as", "111:05", "well and then another doctor another", "111:08", "YouTube guy who has a YouTube channel", "111:09", "did a counterpoint where he said he's", "111:13", "talking about the hygienic theory but he", "111:15", "has it backwards it is true that if you", "111:18", "were never exposed to dirt and bacteria", "111:20", "and whatever it will impact your immune", "111:23", "system but it's actually the opposite is", "111:24", "what happens it's that because you're", "111:26", "not regularly exposed to things your", "111:28", "immune system will overreact and it'll", "111:30", "start attacking things that aren't", "111:32", "really a threat okay", "111:33", "so what's the harm I guess right like", "111:36", "there was a video where these doctors", "111:37", "identified what they think is the", "111:39", "problem with the quarantine and then", "111:41", "another job I think it's both things", "111:43", "though I think it's actually been proven", "111:45", "that yeah that does happen where your", "111:47", "immune system over reacts to people that", "111:49", "don't get exposed to enough but I think", "111:51", "there's also it's also been proven that", "111:52", "people that are around a lot of", "111:54", "different people and constantly exposed", "111:56", "to people have stronger immune systems", "111:58", "because of that that it does get", "112:01", "practice and it does get strengthened by", "112:03", "exposure oh yeah I think that's what the", "112:06", "the sort of act check was saying which", "112:07", "is it's completely true that exposing", "112:10", "kids you know to yes the world out there", "112:12", "is good but that what is being asserted", "112:15", "will happen from staying home for two", "112:17", "months is is both wrong and it wouldn't", "112:19", "happen in this money and he was it like", "112:21", "the idea that it weakens he means yeah I", "112:23", "was wondering about that whether or not", "112:24", "it was like a cardiovascular system like", "112:26", "that it only responds to the level of", "112:29", "you know work that it needs to to do", "112:31", "like your your cardiovascular system you", "112:33", "know you've if you run if you take some", "112:35", "time off boy it slacks off really", "112:37", "quickly it would be a real shame if that", "112:39", "was the case of the immune system I", "112:40", "don't think it's but I mean I guess the", "112:44", "point I was trying to make was if you", "112:46", "there are a lot of people who are", "112:48", "understandably frustrated by what's", "112:50", "going on and they're looking for any", "112:52", "excuse to just let it rip so to speak", "112:56", "and go and do whatever and so I think", "112:58", "that play devil's advocate there is a", "113:00", "different level of risk from allowing", "113:02", "some of this", "113:02", "this information to be propagated that", "113:05", "doesn't exist with leaving Flat Earth up", "113:07", "that's a very good point very good", "113:09", "polite but that being said you know we", "113:11", "last time we talked we had this", "113:12", "conversation about like okay if a", "113:14", "platform gets to a certain size does it", "113:18", "not kind of enter some new space yeah", "113:21", "where you need someone to establish some", "113:23", "guidelines get some real quick one of", "113:27", "the problems with this argument though", "113:28", "is that particularly like those doctors", "113:30", "in Bakersfield", "113:31", "they weren't spreading disinformation", "113:33", "they were basically spreading the actual", "113:36", "facts of fatalities and age groups and", "113:39", "and the you know they just had a", "113:41", "different person interpretation well not", "113:43", "even the different interpretation", "113:45", "because they're basically just going", "113:46", "over the statistics but they had a", "113:47", "different viewpoint of how they should", "113:50", "move forward and they were also", "113:51", "discussing things like furloughed", "113:53", "doctors and nurses because hospitals are", "113:55", "no longer doing elective surgeries so", "113:57", "and then many hospitals are on the verge", "113:59", "of bankruptcy which apparently is true", "114:01", "yeah the problem is that's not", "114:04", "disinformation and so if you're saying", "114:06", "that if giving people this information", "114:09", "makes them make poor choices and they", "114:10", "could be putting themselves at risk or", "114:12", "putting loved ones at risk because of", "114:14", "that yes okay I'm with you", "114:16", "yeah I agree but this isn't", "114:17", "disinformation this is factual", "114:19", "information it's just information with a", "114:22", "different perspective other than that", "114:23", "what we're getting which is only one", "114:25", "point of view from the World Health", "114:27", "Organization and people who subscribe to", "114:28", "those ideas so it's not it's not a lie", "114:31", "but I think your point of if someone", "114:32", "believes in the flatter if there's no",
