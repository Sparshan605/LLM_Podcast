one a year for a", "03:49", "little bit i think that's too much i", "03:51", "think it's too much one a year", "03:52", "but there's something happened around", "03:54", "that time where i think", "03:56", "i believe louis ck was probably one of", "03:58", "the big reasons", "04:00", "why people started doing a lot of really", "04:02", "regular specials", "04:04", "because he was he was if he wasn't the", "04:06", "top guy he was certainly at the top and", "04:08", "you got to remember this is when chris", "04:09", "rock", "04:10", "had taken that he took that self-imposed", "04:12",

he", "04:22", "was at its peak", "04:22", "was doing a stand-up special every year", "04:24", "and i think even he thinks that they", "04:26", "weren't as good as they could have been", "04:27", "if you gave it two years or three years", "04:29", "or something like that but then", "04:30", "everybody started doing that so throw", "04:32", "your material out", "04:33", "and then the the number if you go back i", "04:35", "bet i bet if we had like a chart", "04:37", "that showed the number of stand-up", "04:38", "specials made like when the internet", "04:41", "became really popular in like the 2000s", "04:44", "and then things started getting on the", "04:45", "internet like youtube clips", "04:47", "everything just ramped up everything in", "04:49", "a big way", "04:50", "the not just the sheer volume and", "04:52", "everybody does the same thing now", "04:54", "you abandon your material and then you", "04:55", "do all new stuff", "04:57", "and i think like louis ck during during", "04:59", "that time too like he disrupted the", "05:00", "business model of introducing like the", "05:02", "five dollar special so it's like it", "05:03", "became", "05:04", "something that was like hey you know you", "05:06", "can self-produce it put it out there", "05:07", "there's no middleman middlemen", "05:09", "exactly but i feel like the the the the", "05:13", "hour", "05:14", "like

of", "19:07", "those ones", "19:07", "you i could get called out like i", "19:09", "remember uh reading this case study", "19:11", "like it was in college but so there was", "19:14", "a doctor who had water", "19:15", "right and you know before he froze the", "19:18", "water he would", "19:19", "one he would say nice things the next", "19:20", "one he would say like really mean", "19:22", "obscene things", "19:23", "and then he would freeze it and then the", "19:25", "pattern of which the ice would", "19:26", "kind of crystallize like the one he said", "19:29", "mean things to", "19:30", "like the ice would crystallize in a very", "19:32", "uh dissonant way", "19:33", "like like the pattern didn't look proper", "19:36", "and then the one where he said all these", "19:38", "nice things it was a very beautiful", "19:39", "repetitive organic", "19:41", "like uh crystallization happening if", "19:44", "that's true", "19:45", "and i don't think it is because i'm", "19:47", "pretty sure they debunked that", "19:49", "but that's one of those ones that i have", "19:51", "to be real careful with", "19:52", "because i'm wishing for it to be true", "19:54", "like i hear shit like that and i go well", "19:56", "that would be dope", "19:56", "if you could see that like thoughts and", "19:59", "feelings", "20:00", "actually come out in your words and they", "20:01", "affect physical objects", "20:03", "but i think i read that that was", "20:04", "debunked oh really", "20:06", "yeah but i think it's one of those", "20:07", "believed like it's almost like the", "20:09", "quantum leaping i've read", "20:10", "you know stuff like that where you put", "20:11", "your intentions in the water and it's", "20:13", "kind of", "20:14", "at its earlier routes it's kind of like",

inherently know that it's a", "20:29", "real thing like you feel it so that's i", "20:31", "think one of the reasons why we want to", "20:32", "see it", "20:33", "that's why we would think that like", "20:34", "seeing it in the ice crystals would be", "20:35", "cool yeah it's like under a microscope", "20:37", "when he saw the ice it's like you could", "20:39", "see that design", "20:40", "yeah but it i mean you know eighty", "20:43", "percent of our body is water", "20:45", "it's like to to think that there's not", "20:47", "some kind of like living", "20:48", "thing that it's affected by emotion and", "20:50", "and reactive to", "20:52", "our words which go into plants you know", "20:54", "yeah because we know those feelings are", "20:56", "like when you run into someone that is", "20:58", "mad at you or someone who's", "21:00", "said something bad about it that feeling", "21:02", "it's like um", "21:04", "and if you see someone that you miss", "21:06", "like oh what's up",

you know the sound that one can make", "21:23", "it's like the language could be", "21:24", "different but i think the vibration", "21:26", "that stems from here there's something", "21:28", "that happens between here and here when", "21:29", "it comes out that's", "21:31", "it it affects it it affects people it's", "21:33", "like you can", "21:34", "have somebody not speak the language and", "21:36", "yell at you to know that oh", "21:37", "this guy's pissed yeah we'll just give", "21:39", "you that look you're like", "21:40", "i better get out of here you're right if", "21:42",

have like a few cancer cells", "22:44", "and your body", "22:45", "breaks down those cancer cells i think", "22:47", "that's the key is that like when you get", "22:49", "like", "22:50", "really ill with cancer your body's just", "22:52", "not stopping the reproduction of these", "22:54", "damaged cells so i think if", "22:58", "the dog can smell it they can only smell", "23:00", "it when you got
