he was like not all these", "11:17", "accusations are true but he kind of just", "11:19", "then went on and apologized and did all", "11:21", "this and I'm like but I'm interested in", "11:22", "like are you gonna contestant that's", "11:24", "like what is true and what isn't true", "11:25", "why aren't we interested in what is true", "11:26", "and what isn't true clearly you are a", "11:28",

anything", "11:51", "like that but apparently he might have", "11:52", "rubbed up against some women or did some", "11:54", "some things that are kind of his sexual", "11:56", "assault yes yeah I assume so I guess", "11:59", "what I'm saying is like on somebody", "12:00", "that's essentially sexual assault sure I", "12:02", "mean more like I don't think they're", "12:04", "accusing him of raping them or something", "12:05", "like something like something we're", "12:06", "absolutely horrifying horrific you know", "12:08", "and I'm like well clearly you know I", "12:11", "liked him a

in", "41:06", "there and you're just trying to get by I", "41:08", "understand that but what I'm just saying", "41:10", "like as a whole as a culture to to just", "41:13", "openly accept factory

"was until I was like thirty I'd never", "46:08", "even heard of it and then you hear about", "46:10", "factory farming you go what is that and", "46:12", "all these animals they're all stuffed", "46:14", "together and you're like what I thought", "46:15", "the farms were like animals roamed", "46:17", "around like I don't know what all right", "46:19", "I never even thought about it yeah",

we", "46:48", "just have to have a conversation that's", "46:49", "a Society of what that's going to mean", "46:51", "for food because the exact inverse has", "46:53", "happened with produce where

a", "47:33", "lot of people lost sight of the fact", "47:34", "that a lot of what people were talking", "47:35", "about then was that we were going to die", "47:37", "of famine that the earth Earth's", "47:39", "population was growing way too quickly", "47:40", "and that they would have these guesses", "47:42", "by the late 70s early 80s and go read it", "47:44", "it's fascinating they

good", "48:18", "and III think that there are different", "48:19", "things but does it suggest that we have", "48:21", "to be more vegan more vegetarian all", "48:23", "those kinds of things I don't know if", "48:25", "that's the answer I think we have to", "48:26", "have a complicated conversation and", "48:28", "maybe it comes down to this idea of", "48:30", "cloning meat and or whatever they're", "48:31", "doing like making me and you know", "48:32", "process these weird chemical processes", "48:34", "to make beef that's indistinguishable", "48:35", "from real beef I mean that's fine", "48:37", "if that if it tastes good I think that's", "48:39", "probably what's gonna happen I think", "48:40", "it's probably gonna be like these", "48:41", "headless cows you could just grow

someone", "49:20", "will be as always I I don't know and", "49:24", "again not everybody go hunt wild animals", "49:26", "and if you did there would be no more", "49:27", "wild animals I mean that's really what", "49:29", "the the great market hunting of the", "49:31", "early 19th century that's in the 18th", "49:35", "century as well I think I think when", "49:37", "they started that they they started in", "49:39", "the 1700s started hunting Buffalo and", "49:43", "antelope and by the time they're early", "49:46", "1900s it was almost like completely", "49:48", "wiped out we had almost no animals left", "49:50", "because it was market hunting it wasn't", "49:52", "people hunting like for their own", "49:55", "personal use that they didn't have", "49:56", "refrigerators back down right number so", "49:58", "you had to get meat and it didn't last", "50:00", "very long and they had to get a new", "50:02", "supply of it constantly and they would", "50:04", "just go out and they would take these", "50:06", "guys that were from the war and they", "50:08", "didn't have jobs and so this was their", "50:11", "job now they would go out and hunt", "50:13", "antelope and elk and deer and then sell", "50:15", "that meat at the market what's", "50:17", "interesting too about that is that it's", "50:18", "the human condition it's not only like", "50:19", "the more modern human condition that was", "50:21", "I'm reading a book or I just read a book", "50:22", "called 1491", "50:23", "which is about the condition of the", "50:25", "North and South America and Central", "50:26",

"50:35", "that that the Native Americans the Paleo", "50:38", "Indians wiped out tons of animals and", "50:40", "before when there was literally only a", "50:41", "few hundred thousand of them you know", "50:43", "because they were over hunting them so", "50:45", "this this this cycle continues nope you", "50:47", "know regardless and you even hear about", "50:49", "that in Iceland with the Norse that", "50:51", "lived there where they like depleted", "50:52", "their very precious Woodstock there", "50:54", "there's no animals and you know a lot of", "50:56", "it's not just modern humans that are", "50:58", "that are challenged by this a lot of you", "51:00", "know the", "51:01", "the woolly mammoth and all these animals", "51:02", "were wiped out by humans yeah so it's", "51:04", "very controversial by the way that that", "51:07", "is there's a lot of people that believe", "51:09", "that that had to coincide because the", "51:11", "dates coincide with the end of the Ice", "51:13", "Age and there's a guy that I've had on", "51:15", "this podcast several times named Randall", "51:17", "Carlson and he has some very compelling", "51:19", "evidence that points to the possibility", "51:20", "that it was asteroid impact that wiped", "51:24", "out these animals and mass and it's one", "51:26", "of the reasons why in certain parts of", "51:28", "the world you could find mass graveyards", "51:30", "of animals that were killed almost", "51:31", "instantly", "51:32", "and this was ten thousand years ago", "51:34", "worse yeah interesting excited twelve", "51:36", "thousand years ago does they think", "51:37", "there's two possible large impacts that", "51:40", "happened so they weren't bold odds they", "51:41", "were they were actually they actually", "51:43", "struck the e so they weren't like the", "51:44", "Tunguska event with an explosion they", "51:45", "actually hit they think it struck the", "51:47", "ice sheet above North America Oh", "51:49", "interesting so there would be no", "51:50", "evidence right well North America well", "51:52", "though they think that was the reason", "51:53", "why there's this it's a fascinating", "51:55", "podcast to go back and listen to and he", "51:57", "I had him on with another guy named", "52:00", "Michael Shermer was a famous skeptic and", "52:01", "Graham Hancock who's also a proponent of", "52:03", "some of his ideas and they showed all", "52:07", "these images of like these deep fissures", "52:09", "that were cut into the into the land", "52:11", "that must have been a massive amount of", "52:14", "water over a very short period of time", "52:15", "and he thinks it was probably a large", "52:18", "body that slammed into the polar ice", "52:21", "caps or slammed into rather the ice caps", "52:23", "that are above you know North America", "52:25", "somewhere around 10,000 years ago at two", "52:27", "miles high of ice over much of the", "52:29", "surface of it and all sudden boom gone", "52:32", "and that's what caused the Great Lakes I", "52:36", "mean the Great Lakes are essentially", "52:37", "these gigantic glaciers that melted and", "52:40", "there's all sorts of features in these", "52:43", "various landscapes that he believes", "52:46", "point to massive amounts of water that", "52:48", "happened over an incredibly short period", "52:49", "of time and the explanation for that and", "52:52", "that peaks in the the rises and the", "52:53", "falls in temperature during that time", "52:57", "when they do like a core samples of the", "52:59", "earth he thinks that that also points to", "53:01", "some sort of an impact that's", "53:03", "fascinating yeah a course in science", "53:05", "Randall Carlson and lacrosse I've been", "53:07", "studying this his whole life he had an", "53:09", "idea once when he was on acid he went", "53:12", "and", "53:12", "that over this gigantic Canyon when he", "53:15", "was on acid and he had this idea that", "53:17", "this all happened because of water and", "53:19", "he's trying to like piece it together", "53:21", "and then became fasting and starts", "53:24", "studying it and then got really into", "53:26", "asteroid impacts and he's a wealth of", "53:29", "knowledge but really really fast and you", "53:31", "got to talk that's fascinating I love", "53:32", "that stuff man well that's what's so", "53:34", "frustrating and why I didn't study in", "53:36", "college or really super interested in", "53:38", "ancient history or even you know paleo", "53:41", "history and pre-human history and stuff", "53:42", "because it's all so hypothetical you'll", "53:44", "never really know you know you have to", "53:46", "just kind of trust people much smarter", "53:47", "than you that they have these these", "53:49", "these good ideas that sometimes conflict", "53:51", "and but you'll never really know the", "53:53", "answer it's so frustrating to me yeah", "53:54", "those ideas definitely do conflict here", "53:56", "this is the area that he looked over", "53:58", "here play some volume", "54:35", "[Applause]", "54:44", "is a long long detailed thing I mean", "54:48", "he's talked about on the podcast for", "54:50", "hours and hours I've had him on several", "54:52", "times and it's still there's still a lot", "54:54", "of information to cover because this", "54:56", "guy's been studying this his whole life", "54:57", "I'm gonna look into that that sounds", "54:59", "interesting", "55:00", "absolutely positive that humans had an", "55:03", "impact on woolly mammoths and a lot of", "55:05", "other animals but there's a lot of", "55:08", "people that are very very hesitant to", "55:11", "blame the entire eradication of these", "55:14", "animals on people yeah I don't I don't", "55:17", "know enough about it", "55:18", "I do recommend the book though digit", "55:19", "just an interesting insight into a 49 to", "55:21", "one it's called just an interesting", "55:22", "insight into into agriculture and so", "55:25", "just some ideas that kind of cobble", "55:26", "together some sort of like vision of", "55:29", "this place mmm before you know", "55:31", "mainstream European contact was", "55:32", "obviously a few places that I would I", "55:34", "mean if you had a time machine I've", "55:36", "always thought about this like if you", "55:37", "could go in some sort of an invisible", "55:38", "bubble and experience the earth at", "55:42", "various stages there's two two things I", "55:43", "would love to see I would love to see", "55:45", "during the great pyramids like when when", "55:47", "they were in their prime I would love to", "55:49", "see what was the Egypt actually like", "55:50", "before they burned the Library of", "55:52", "Alexandria and I would have loved to", "55:54", "have seen a native tribe in North", "55:58", "America pre-colonization right you know", "56:01", "it'd be fascinating and that's that's", "56:03", "the frustrating thing as well never", "56:04", "really quite know the answer but it's", "56:06", "it's fun to speculate about and you I", "56:08", "was reading interest and and then you'd", "56:09", "find interesting I was reading about the", "56:11", "Easter Islanders um and how they have it", "56:16", "they have sweet potatoes on the island", "56:18", "which are not indigenous to the island", "56:20", "and they the sweet potato would kind of", "56:21", "spread around Polynesia presumably from", "56:23", "South America and there's this", "56:25", "interesting thing that the the word I", "56:28", "don't remember the exact word but the", "56:29", "word that many Polynesians are many", "56:31", "Polynesian societies that were separated", "56:33", "from each other used for the sweet", "56:34", "potato is identical to what they were", "56:35", "using on the South American mainland", "56:37", "and indicating that the the islands", "56:41", "might've been populated from the other", "56:42", "direction that they assumed that people", "56:44", "came down from like what is I guess like", "56:46", "Indonesia into Australia and then kind", "56:47", "of hopped over to those islands but", "56:49", "people are suggesting that there must", "56:50", "have been contact from paleo Americans", "56:53", "on those islands because they eat sweet", "56:54", "potatoes which are indigenous to South", "56:55", "America and they call them the same", "56:57", "exact thing that the these societies", "56:59", "that were thousands of miles apart had", "57:02", "had experience and you hear about a lot", "57:04", "of this it was their cross transatlantic", "57:06", "contact yeah", "57:08", "could that and then it gets into crazy", "57:10", "like conspiracy theories about the", "57:11", "pyramids and stuff but were there with", "57:13", "the Phoenicians come over where an", "57:14", "Egyptian contact the the Chinese come", "57:16", "here that the Romans I remember that", "57:18", "there was this this theory that Romans", "57:20", "might have been on the Pacific coast of", "57:22", "North America because they found I guess", "57:25", "they apparently found some coins Roman", "57:27", "coins and they found these jars that I", "57:30", "guess were ancient Roman or supposedly", "57:33", "ancient Roman anchors or ships I've seen", "57:36", "that that was these are recent", "57:38", "discoveries right I think so the last", "57:39", "ten years maybe yeah yeah yeah I mean", "57:41", "the human history is it's you know kind", "57:45", "of pieced together by what we find and", "57:48", "every now and then they find something", "57:49", "they go oh okay you know I mean what's", "57:52", "really crazy is that the with the Native", "57:55", "Americans when the settlers got here", "57:57", "when Europeans got here they didn't have", "57:58", "horses but horses actually evolved in", "58:01", "North America horses evolved in North", "58:03", "America and then by crossing the Bering", "58:07", "landmass made their way into Asia and", "58:09", "and all throughout the rest of the world", "58:11", "even zebras they originally started in", "58:13", "North America wild but then somehow or", "58:16", "another so for some reason they went", "58:18", "extinct in North America and you know", "58:21", "they survived and thrived in Europe and", "58:24", "then they were reintroduced and Dan", "58:27", "Flores he's a wildlife historian he he", "58:30", "maintains that the Native Americans once", "58:33", "once they had firearms and the horse", "58:36", "that they would have wiped out the", "58:38", "Buffalo on their own that had nothing to", "58:40", "do with like like market hunting and all", "58:43", "the things that the Europeans did was", "58:45", "terrible and it happened quite rapidly", "58:47", "but he maintains that it was it was", "58:50", "going to happen and", "58:50", "just just the nature of what kind of an", "58:53", "animal it was and that humans were", "58:55", "eventually going to get to them anyway", "58:56", "yeah I mean that's what we were talking", "58:59", "about the human condition and how things", "59:00", "don't seem to change regardless of who", "59:02", "you're talking about and I'm always", "59:03", "fascinated by these tangental kind of", "59:05", "connections between these different", "59:06", "societies that we're learning more and", "59:07", "more about that the world is way smaller", "59:09", "than I think we thought it was in", "59:11", "antiquity and even before that they were", "59:14", "talking about how some Greenland like a", "59:17", "and and I guess Newfoundland and New", "59:19", "Brunswick and all of these kind of had", "59:20", "these Indian tribes that definitely", "59:22", "probably had extended contact with the", "59:24", "Vikings for a long period of time and", "59:26", "and these words kind of find their way", "59:28", "to like the st. Lawrence Valley that", "59:29", "described the same things and then when", "59:31", "the French fur traders come they find", "59:33", "that they're using words that they", "59:35", "shouldn't know and yeah it's it's super", "59:38", "fascinating like the these brilliant", "59:39", "scholars that kind of put these things", "59:40", "together for us yeah it is amazing you", "59:43", "know I mean and just think of how much", "59:46", "we don't know", "59:47", "I mean God to be able to go back 6,000", "59:51", "years ago and just be a fly on the wall", "59:53", "and some ancient civilization and see", "59:55", "how they interacted with each other", "59:57", "Oh awesome they were awesome you even", "59:59", "read about there were these great", "60:01", "there's outside of st. Louis I think", "60:02", "it's like Cahokia or something I thought", "60:04", "it was this massive Native American", "60:06", "metropolis in North America we often", "60:08", "think about Central and South America as", "60:09", "having these mate you know Aztec Inca", "60:11", "all these major cities but there were", "60:12", "major mound cities in North America that", "60:15", "were populated by maybe twenty-five", "60:16", "thirty thousand people and they were", "60:18", "wiped out before we even got here or", "60:20", "before our European ancestors got here", "60:21", "yeah and it's so god you're right", "60:25", "because it would just be so interesting", "60:26", "to see how do they live how do they farm", "60:28", "how what was their commerce like you", "60:31", "know what was their languages like did", "60:32", "they they did they have written records", "60:33", "that didn't survive and I don't know", "60:35", "it's but again that ties back in a Venn", "60:37", "diagram of frustration because it never", "60:39", "really enough there's a ranch up in", "60:42", "central California that I go to", "60:43", "sometimes called Tejon ranch and there's", "60:46", "these stone circles that are carved in", "60:49", "rocks so they have these massive rocks", "60:51", "and then there's like these concave like", "60:54", "dugouts", "60:55", "where they would make bread so you're", "60:59", "looking at places where they would grind", "61:01", "grain into these rocks", "61:03", "these holes are you know who knows how", "61:05", "long they existed who knows how long ago", "61:10", "these subsistence farmers or subsistence", "61:13", "people lived there and did this and so", "61:16", "you're stepping over these rocks and", "61:19", "staring down there some Getty Images of", "61:21", "them those holes were carved by the", "61:26", "Native Americans and they were done over", "61:27", "fucking years and years of grinding", "61:30", "stones into the stone and no what's", "61:33", "interesting is a lot of the ancient", "61:35", "Egyptians I want to see the mummy", "61:37", "exhibit at the natural natural history", "61:41", "museum or the Science Museum which one", "61:43", "is in California", "61:44", "anyway they had a museum exhibit on", "61:47", "mummies and they said all their teeth", "61:49", "were ground down and it's because when", "61:51", "they would make their bread and they", "61:53", "would grind stone into stone it would", "61:55", "create sand and that sand would be in", "61:58", "the bread and she said to be eating this", "62:00",

why", "79:39", "they use the term I guess life as we", "79:40", "know it yeah", "79:41", "but I'm of the same mind as you I think", "79:44", "with just the mathematical permutations", "79:47", "you

it was awesome I knew one", "80:41", "yeah yep the one from 2004 yeah yeah I I", "80:44", "loved it because I think it married", "80:46", "really well sci-fi believable sci-fi", "80:48", "with the

because", "81:06", "it was a retake of was the 1970s it was", "81:09", "like 79 1980 I thought yeah it was a", "81:11", "retake of that show that seemed to be at", "81:14", "the time to be a Star Wars ripoff you", "81:16", "know it was like there was like your", "81:18", "Luke Skywalker character that was", "81:20", "Starbuck you know there was all this", "81:22", "there was all this stuff to it that", "81:24", "people like ah that's a fake", "81:26", "stormtrooper my god this show sucks", "81:29", "yeah it was a movie yeah it was a show", "81:32", "rather yeah it was yeah it started as a", "81:34", "like a miniseries which is about the", "81:36", "Cylons turning on the humans and then or", "81:38", "I guess their end result of them turning", "81:39", "on the humans and then and then they", "81:41", "expanded into four seasons I think I", "81:43", "think the show is amazing and no show", "81:45", "was it only four seasons yeah I think it", "81:47", "was 2000 yeah I think it was 2004 2009", "81:49", "or something I thought bringing it back", "81:51", "come on fuckers Netflix get on it come", "81:53", "on", "81:53", "I know chancel in house of cards give us", "81:56", "some Battlestar Galactica yeah", "81:57", "Battlestar was great I thought that they", "81:58", "told the Ark really well fascinate I", "82:00", "thought the acting was pretty good and I", "82:02", "liked the idea of the because we're", "82:05", "dealing with it tangental II now the the", "82:06", "idea of not that it's unique to to that", "82:08", "story but some AI and robots turning on", "82:11", "you you know like it's so very smart", "82:13", "people are telling us that that's very", "82:14", "possible and so we should probably start", "82:15", "listening to them yeah well it is", "82:17", "possible of course it's possible I think", "82:19", "we could be a new life-form I mean I", "82:20", "really do believe that I think we're", "82:23", "either probably going to be augmented by", "82:24", "these creations and you know we're gonna", "82:26", "choose to you know take on new body", "82:30", "parts that function much better than the", "82:32", "body parts we have now or we're you know", "82:34", "essentially laboring to create some", "82:38", "thing that's gonna surpass us that", "82:40", "absolutely could be it this idea that", "82:42", "it's artificial - it's like well it's", "82:44", "right there it's real like if it's a", "82:47", "life-form", "82:48", "oh it's artificial life no it's", "82:50", "electronic life you know it's something", "82:52", "that humans have created but it's still", "82:53", "life it doesn't like if you take a plant", "82:56", "right you know I was looking at these", "82:57", "plants and they splice different plants", "83:01", "together like they splice pistachios", "83:04", "into avocados like they have like the", "83:06", "base of a notic avocado tree and", "83:08", "pistachios are growing on the outside", "83:09", "I'm like what the fuck that's wild I", "83:12", "didn't know you could do that yeah me", "83:13", "neither yeah well is that artificial", "83:15", "what is that seems like it's artificial", "83:17", "life right I mean it's", "83:18", "like they've figured out some way to", "83:19", "engineer things in a crude sense you", "83:23", "know by splicing and grafting and doing", "83:26", "all these different weird things to", "83:27", "plants", "83:27", "well that's it's still life though right", "83:31", "it's still alive it's functional and we", "83:33", "we think of life as though you buddy has", "83:35", "to have bones or blood or scales or fins", "83:38", "and says who says who says us and our", "83:41", "limited sort of vocabulary and our very", "83:46", "very limited encyclopedia of variables", "83:49", "that we allow to consider life yeah I", "83:51", "think I think you're right because we", "83:52", "have to judge maybe life based on", "83:54", "consciousness instead of not that a", "83:56", "plant would have consciousness but I", "83:57", "think that's the kind of the ethical", "83:59", "question we're gonna start coming up", "84:00", "with with machines in the next 20 or 30", "84:02", "years is are you developing something it", "84:05", "there's actually a great I don't want to", "84:06", "ruin it for you there's an amazing black", "84:08", "mirror that kind of touches on this it's", "84:10", "called a thing called white Christmas", "84:11", "you should check it out if you have time", "84:12", "okay and jon Hamm's actually the main", "84:15", "character in it for madmen and it the", "84:18", "idea that like if something is conscious", "84:21", "even if it's not real or even if it's", "84:23", "only in a computer what does that mean", "84:26", "and what if the what if it was trapped", "84:28", "there what if it didn't have agency over", "84:30", "its life but it was still conscious and", "84:31", "stuff like that like you're we're", "84:32", "messing with things that we don't", "84:33", "understand in this regard because even", "84:36", "the word consciousness doesn't really", "84:37", "have a concrete definition we couldn't", "84:39", "even know what it is we are conscious", "84:41", "when my dog's conscious but are they", "84:43", "self conscious and and at what level of", "84:45", "consciousness and that's what makes us", "84:46", "human right so if we're gonna implant", "84:48", "that into other machines even if they're", "84:51", "just computers even if they're literally", "84:52", "just running on an operating system then", "84:54", "then there are there definitely many", "84:55", "ethical questions to ask", "84:56", "I think did you see that Google", "84:59", "situation they had where the two", "85:00", "computers were communicating each other", "85:02", "into a with a language that they", "85:03", "invented them to write about yeah I saw", "85:05", "I read a little bit about that but I", "85:07", "don't know too much about it", "85:07", "yeah they shut it down like what yeah", "85:10", "it's horrifying right", "85:12", "it's happening like so much quicker then", "85:13", "yeah I mean it's we've envisioned these", "85:16", "things it's like Skynet or the Cylons or", "85:19", "something like that but I think it's", "85:19", "gonna be much more quaint yeah you know", "85:21", "that's what they were very stunned by", "85:23", "this and you know I saw somebody trying", "85:25", "to diminishing it trying to diminish it", "85:27", "and he was like well it's just ones and", "85:29", "zeroes it's just like what they're doing", "85:30", "the communicating ones do I was I", "85:32", "yeah but they're talking exchanging", "85:34", "information back and forth in a method", "85:36", "that we don't understand and they do how", "85:40", "the fuck do they and why have they", "85:42", "chosen to talk to each other and is this", "85:44", "like one you know you have like a", "85:46", "science fiction movie and the beginning", "85:48", "of the movie you have these engineers", "85:50", "sitting around and the the engineers", "85:52", "going on Mike", "85:54", "Mike come here and look at this real", "85:55", "quick they're talking to each other what", "85:58", "do you mean they're talking to each", "85:59", "other there well there's there's a", "86:00", "language this is see this see this is an", "86:02", "exchange here and here's the answer and", "86:05", "here's a response to the answer and here", "86:06", "they've agreed upon this and now they've", "86:08", "expanded their sentences like shut it", "86:10", "down just shut it down just well what do", "86:13", "we do about this let's let it play out", "86:14", "no no let's shut it down let's talk", "86:16", "about this and then they shut it down", "86:18", "and it face to black cut to smash cut", "86:20", "like you see a new time to 2034 and some", "86:24", "dystopian Mad Max fucking world and", "86:27", "robot people are running down the street", "86:29", "chasing after biological people wanting", "86:32", "to use them for fuel well it's", "86:34", "interesting it's interesting because", "86:35", "there are different there are different", "86:37", "reasons why a robot or a machine might", "86:39", "earn on you right like I I think the", "86:41", "Cylons were interesting because they", "86:42", "turn because they were enslaved right so", "86:44", "that was there was vengeance which is a", "86:46", "human quality by the way an animal", "86:49", "doesn't really understand vengeance but", "86:51", "a robots do yeah well I guess about", "86:53", "higher primates or whatever might", "86:55", "understand a retaliatory kind of thing", "86:56", "but generally this is a human quality", "86:59", "right and what's a primate primary", "87:01", "primary quality and so there's that but", "87:05", "that so there's like this enslavement", "87:06", "retaliation kind of thing going on but", "87:09", "then there's the very like what I always", "87:11", "find fascinating I think this is more", "87:12", "what Skynet was all about in terminator", "87:14", "although I don't really remember is the", "87:15", "idea that if you look at if you look at", "87:18", "the landscape of what's happening and", "87:19", "you and you just remove the most", "87:21", "inefficient part of it it's the human", "87:23", "like in other words them acting as they", "87:25", "are machines like this this doesn't make", "87:28", "any sense this makes our processing", "87:29", "slower this particular component needs", "87:31", "to be removed so there's a very logical", "87:32", "reason why they would go after you to I", "87:34", "think it's it is the stuff of sci-fi but", "87:36", "like so many things that start in sci-fi", "87:37", "it ends up bleeding into into real life", "87:40", "and I think it's when I see people like", "87:42", "Stephen Hawking Bill Gates Elon Musk", "87:45", "about this I'm like these are some of", "87:46", "the smartest people that society has", "87:47", "ever given us yeah and I think we might", "87:49", "want to pay attention and have some I", "87:50", "think what they want is some sort of", "87:51", "Congress not not American Congress but", "87:53", "some sort of international coalition", "87:55", "that agrees this is what we're gonna do", "87:57", "and this is how far we'll push the", "87:58", "boundaries because and I just don't know", "88:00", "that we'll get there before it's I want", "88:02", "to say before it's too late but before", "88:03", "we have a scary situation I mean e-even", "88:06", "from a mechanical situation what they're", "88:08", "doing at Boston Dynamics it's fucking", "88:10", "horrifying I look at the videos and I'm", "88:13", "like what the and they're it's so funny", "88:16", "because I some people have said in the", "88:17", "past like if you see them like they're", "88:18", "they're using hockey sticks a lot like", "88:20", "beat them or like take like knock", "88:21", "something out of their hands and stuff", "88:22", "and I'm like these are the videos", "88:23", "they're gonna show they're gonna show", "88:25", "them in their in their military camps", "88:27", "when they're turning on you bad there's", "88:30", "so many different versions of them they", "88:32", "have them look like they look like", "88:33", "cheetahs they have them that look like", "88:35", "dogs I mean here's they look like people", "88:38", "like the city yeah and these guys are", "88:41", "just constantly working on these things", "88:43", "too and constantly improve where is", "88:44", "Boston Dynamics is it I think it's I", "88:46", "think it's in Cambridge because I think", "88:48", "a lot of you know I think a lot of", "88:49", "people uh MIT might migrate there and I", "88:52", "think Google owned them but I think", "88:54", "they've divested if I remember correctly", "88:56", "that is so wild yeah and the ones where", "88:58", "they like knock them over yes and like", "89:00", "they get up yeah they can't that's what", "89:02", "yeah like a gyroscope is going I guess", "89:04", "in the it's yeah gyroscopes are", "89:08", "fascinating you know just something that", "89:10", "can sort of self balance this is the", "89:13", "stuff they're gonna show them in like", "89:14", "that and to hype them up in their", "89:16", "propaganda yeah it's fucking amazing it", "89:21", "is it is amazing I mean these are these", "89:22", "are it's so smart these people that that", "89:25", "do that if I manage to do this don't you", "89:27", "want to pull them aside and go hey man", "89:28", "what's the fuckin endgame yeah exactly", "89:30", "yeah robot you can't kick over come on", "89:35", "it brings up it brings up like ideas how", "89:40", "will we fight wars in the future will we", "89:41", "do them with this 100% yeah especially", "89:43", "if we fight some war with some sort of a", "89:45", "primitive culture I like how they have", "89:48", "imbalanced with all these packs it's", "89:49", "great it's incredible like a highlight", "89:51", "clip of all the times they've abused it", "89:53", "robot", "89:56", "oh yeah the robot general right now has", "89:58", "this plane behind him and as he's", "89:59", "talking and he's like remember what", "90:01", "they've done to your ancestors well", "90:03", "they're saying abuse but they're", "90:04", "checking tolerances no I you know the", "90:07", "robot seemed to relax this is how we", "90:08", "made you so awesome you dumb fucks", "90:12", "you stupid pricks you can't even walk on", "90:14", "ice now the interesting thing the", "90:17", "interesting thing to me about this is", "90:19", "and I don't know if you feel but I kind", "90:21", "of do is like when they're tripping and", "90:22", "falling I have this feeling of like I", "90:24", "have this feeling like yeah we're like", "90:25", "oh look at this guy", "90:29", "yeah you feel bad for this guy he can't", "90:31", "even kick this one over wow that thing", "90:34", "is stout yeah I mean so they have", "90:37", "multiple different models the video name", "90:41", "is funny by the way Jamie this it's a", "90:43", "literally named everytime Boston", "90:44", "Dynamics has abused the robot it's not", "90:47", "abuse you dummies it's fucking testing", "90:50", "this is how they find out but look at", "90:51", "that nerd that's kicking it over go back", "90:52", "to that guy oh that that link sucks go", "90:55", "back to that one guy that was kicking it", "90:56", "look at him he's like looks like he just", "90:59", "everybody go back go back to him so you", "91:03", "can see him do it", "91:03", "watch me fucking piece of shit he's like", "91:08", "looks like he always wanted to kick", "91:09", "somebody's projecting like even with his", "91:11", "little tiny short steps I think it seems", "91:13", "awkward before he kicks it like yeah I'm", "91:16", "gonna kick it now look at this one", "91:18", "oh it's balancing on one leg and hitting", "91:20", "it with a twenty pound medicine ball Wow", "91:25", "yeah we're in for a weird hundred years", "91:28", "yes and that's what I'm saying I hope", "91:29", "that we get to see some because I think", "91:31", "it's gonna get fucking crazy yeah no", "91:32", "there's no doubt it is it's no doubt it", "91:34", "is it's just like.how crazy and what's", "91:36", "going to be the issues that we're and", "91:38", "have to confront sentient life and all", "91:41", "so the real question is will it have any", "91:44", "motivation to advance like the idea is", "91:47", "that the real fear is that these things", "91:49", "are going to be so hyper intelligent", "91:51", "that they're going to be able to create", "91:52", "a much better version of themselves", "91:54", "fairly quickly like as soon as you give", "91:57", "them autonomy and as soon as they're", "91:59", "sentient you're gonna say okay make a", "92:02", "better one make a better one than you", "92:04", "and they'll this is you guys fucked up", "92:05", "here like why have all these shitty", "92:08", "connections", "92:09", "let's do it this

difference we our", "129:37", "people call us a democracy but we're not", "129:39", "a democracy we're a republic the idea is", "129:41", "that you send you vote for people that", "129:43", "go make decisions on your behalf and", "129:44", "sometimes those decisions are gonna be", "129:46", "unpopular but some people do know better", "129:48", "than others and so there are certain", "129:50",

so you have to ask people that", "129:58", "understand what it is to run a business", "130:00", "and how you can make that easier so we", "130:01", "can't judge things based on that only my", "130:04", "major concern with him though is that", "130:05", "he's so unpopular even in his own party", "130:07", "and even specifically with the house", "130:09", "that because they are constantly up for", "130:11", "re-election that you know it's it they", "130:14", "haven't had one legislative like when in", "130:17", "in in the entire time he's been", "130:19", "president doesn't have all the positions", "130:20", "fully staffed as well yeah there there", "130:23", "are things and that's not uncommon", "130:25", "either that sometimes things go for", "130:26", "years without being staffed

president", "133:36", "is in charge and the military has to", "133:39", "come to the president for direction and", "133:42", "for guidance and for approval", "133:44", "whereas Donald Trump is kind of said", "133:46", "look you people know what to do better", "133:48", "than anybody do what you got to do it", "133:50", "could be that I mean yeah it could be", "133:51", "voluntary but it's still it's only sort", "133:53", "of coup because that's not what you're", "133:55", "supposed to do so I'm supposed to do now", "133:57", "I trust the military the American", "133:59", "yes absolutely what I was gonna say was", "134:01", "that typically a military coup in", "134:03", "history is a super negative connotation", "134:05", "than Egyptians Libyans whatever the case", "134:06", "might be it
