"05:08", "consequences or mentally I think you did", "05:10", "a fantastic job at the Holi fight like", "05:12", "literally you did in that fight other", "05:15", "than the fifth round which is the most", "05:16", "amazing part of it but you did", "05:18", "everything we were talking about like", "05:20", "what you have to do to beat her I'm like", "05:22", "she's got to stay on the outside she", "05:23", "could have very her rhythm and she's got", "05:24", "to let Holly come to her like she can't", "05:26", "rush in because you rush into Holly it's", "05:29", "like rushing into Machida", "05:30", "or rushing to anybody who's a great", "05:32", "counter striker you saw the wrong to", "05:34", "fight Ronda just came bulldogging on her", "05:36", "and tried to out bulldogger and you just", "05:38", "you can't do that with Holly she's too", "05:40", "fast good footwork to her striking is so", "05:42", "precise her her counters are so clean", "05:45", "and her movements very hard to read it", "05:48", "gets very unpredictable I remember well", "05:50", "a couple times I tried to maybe come", "05:51", "forward and get her to go to the fence", "05:53", "and I couldn't tell whether she was", "05:54", "gonna jet out to the right to the left", "05:55", "like she was like two steps back left", "05:57", "and oh yeah you know like ah you know", "05:59", "like I couldn't even tell like she gave", "06:00", "no indication of which way she was gonna", "06:02", "go yeah well you just did a fantastic", "06:05", "job of varying your approach to your", "06:07", "speed was different like you you you did", "06:10", "a lot of fainting you varied things up a", "06:12", "lot and you could tell like she was like", "06:14", "almost like waiting for these moments to", "06:16", "happen when you're gonna come forward", "06:17", "and then you wouldn't come forward and", "06:19", "then it becomes like a test of patience", "06:21", "like who's going to get outside of their", "06:23", "comfort zone who's gonna take chances", "06:25", "who's gonna who's going to engage yeah", "06:27", "and she also has that weird stance too", "06:29", "was she kind of halfway sounds like a", "06:31", "boxer and halfway stands like a karate", "06:33", "person yeah she throws like a lot of", "06:34", "side kicks on front leg techniques yeah", "06:37", "she's she's she's a tricky one but", "06:40", "we put together a really good game plan", "06:41", "I was happy with that okay he did but it", "06:45", "was a fifth round a fifth round was", "06:46", "crazy", "06:47", "god when you grabbed ahold of her and", "06:49", "then eventually got her back and got her", "06:52", "to the ground it was so crazy because", "06:54", "every aspect of from your initial", "06:58", "entrance to the takedown to getting her", "07:00", "back there was nothing a hundred percent", "07:02", "about it it was all touch-and-go it was", "07:04", "all a scramble it wasn't like you had", "07:06", "complete total control over like maybe", "07:09", "like Demian Maia versus Ric story like", "07:11", "he Damon Maya gets rich stories back", "07:12", "he's got him locked up and then he", "07:14", "anacondas him and squeezes them and then", "07:16", "it gets him it wasn't like that it was", "07:18", "like you were fighting for your fucking", "07:19", "life and you knew there was no time", "07:22", "there was no time you were likely down", "07:24", "by like at least one round and you were", "07:26", "headed into the fifth and final round", "07:27", "and maybe if you won that round you", "07:29", "could have got the decision but fuck", "07:30", "you're fighting the champ you know who", "07:32", "knows who knows what's gonna happen you", "07:34", "take her back and then when she tries

she went out", "07:44", "and you climbed off her and she was", "07:45", "unconscious like holy shit holy shit", "07:48", "what a moment and I was inaudible it was", "07:51", "incredible it was one of the best", "07:53", "moments in all of women's championship", "07:56", "fighting as far as like like an extreme", "07:59", "extremely dramatic moment where like", "08:03", "you're you're trying to accomplish", "08:04", "something she's fighting tooth and claw", "08:06", "neither one of you are exhausted so it's", "08:09", "not like anyone's like physically", "08:10", "compromised it's just a fucking mad", "08:12", "scramble between two killers and you get", "08:15", "her and you got her back and then you", "08:17", "get it back and you sink the choke and", "08:18", "she's trying to fucking shake you off", "08:19", "and you hung in there and when she", "08:22", "rolled and you're on top of her and you", "08:23", "hung on to it you realize like oh my god", "08:26", "she's going out yeah she is", "08:28", "she didn't even tap she was throwing", "08:30", "punches in the air while you were", "08:32", "choking her unconscious I kept waiting", "08:34", "to myself like when is she gonna tap it", "08:36", "didn't in my in that instinctual moment", "08:39", "I'm so used to in training you get", "08:40", "people in a choke you know they tap so", "08:42", "I'm waiting for that tap and I'm like", "08:43", "good god like when is this girl gonna", "08:45", "tap like I know I've got her when she'd", "08:47", "you know tap on it and then then I felt", "08:49", "her like I saw her you know from my", "08:51", "peripherals kind of do something I", "08:53", "wasn't quite sure if she was tapped", "08:54", "what she was doing until I watched the", "08:55", "video later and I felt him pull me off", "08:57", "and I'm like that's the feeling that we", "08:59", "fight for is that feeling that that", "09:01", "feelings like I did it I established my", "09:03", "dominance you know it's a it's a it's a", "09:05", "prideful sport in some ways you know", "09:07", "it's hand-to-hand combat with someone", "09:09", "else it's like you know I did it tonight", "09:11", "it was better it has to be prideful", "09:13", "because otherwise there's just certain", "09:14", "sacrifices and certain fires that you're", "09:17", "just not gonna walk through like you", "09:19", "have to have

meet perfectly in that", "09:43", "moment including the training camp not", "09:46", "overtraining did you ever hear that", "09:47", "video that um the video is not that good", "09:50", "but the audio is is awesome it's between", "09:53", "the fourth and fifth round and it's my", "09:54", "corners what they're telling me this or", "09:56", "the fifth round it's such an emotional", "09:59", "video for me when I watched it it makes", "10:01", "me relive that moment and Bryan came in", "10:04", "there and essentially he was like Misha", "10:06", "you've got to get after you got it you", "10:08",

patient", "10:40", "but persistent don't run into anything", "10:41", "because you you know you'll get caught", "10:43", "you get knocked out you'll get need", "10:44", "you'll get kicked you'll get punched so", "10:46", "don't do that but you got to look for", "10:47", "the opening when it's the right timing", "10:49", "it's all about timing and after I took", "10:52", "her down in that second round and I just", "10:53", "beat her up that round", "10:55", "she was so um so cautious in the third", "10:59", "and fourth and so perfect you know her", "11:01", "game plan was perfect to to beat

watching it that's what the", "11:44", "judges say yeah well it should have been", "11:45", "but but what I'm what I meant was the", "11:47", "question watching it was like I won like", "11:50", "when we were when you were headed into", "11:51", "the fifth round what my question was was", "11:53", "I wonder if she got a 10-8 round for", "11:55", "that second round because if she did", "11:57",

people that have a", "14:01", "problem with that but in my mind that", "14:03", "there is an art to what you guys did in", "14:06", "that fight and even what Holly did", "14:08", "because up until that fifth round mean", "14:10", "like you said especially the third and", "14:12", "fourth she was doing what she wanted to", "14:14", "do she was she's and there was a display", "14:16", "going on
