she", "08:19", "might have been just rocked and there's", "08:21", "also the reality that she was knocked", "08:23", "out fucking cold", "08:25", "a year ago and it was a bad beating and", "08:27", "then a vicious head kick and there was", "08:30", "something about those goddamn neck kicks", "08:32", "man there's something about when when", "08:34", "someone shins you in the neck like she", "08:37", "got shin and your whole body just goes", "08:38", "limp you're doing so much damage in", "08:41", "there but she had 411 days off that's", "08:44", "nice I think it was just bad strategy", "08:46", "just really simple the strategy was not", "08:49", "good just that's just bad that's", "08:51", "possible too all those things", "08:52", "I was the one who said like way early on", "08:54", "I think Amanda's her most dangerous", "08:55", "challenge because Amanda hit so fucking", "08:58", "hard after she starched Sara McMann and", "09:00", "when she when she was beating up me SH I", "09:02", "was like Jesus said she punches harder", "09:05", "than anybody in that division she's got", "09:06", "like dangerous weapons with her hands", "09:08", "but I think I really think there's a lot", "09:11", "of people that get killed like that and", "09:12", "they are never the same again", "09:13", "I agree they can't absorb a shot anymore", "09:16", "and then also your brain", "09:17", "according to chuck liddell he was", "09:19", "telling me about it like because he you", "09:21", "know chuck was so tough that he would", "09:23", "like just fucking use his chin sort of", "09:25", "like lineker does like it's part of his", "09:27", "defense like knowing that he can absorb", "09:29", "shots and after a while his brain was", "09:31", "like hey man fuck you like his brain was", "09:34", "just like we're not even to do this and", "09:36", "just cuz yeah just shuts off early I", "09:38", "also think tech to you there's a certain", "09:40", "level where the were there that great", "09:41", "you look at like a Tiger Woods or Mike", "09:43", "Tyson when that foundation gets a little", "09:46", "shaky there's just never the same yeah", "09:48", "that's true it's just never there like", "09:49", "I'm not God's gift of the UFC exactly oh", "09:52", "then memory gods don't give a shit", "09:53", "exactly and then like we said even if", "09:55", "she was undefeated and she saw it fought", "09:57", "Nunez noonas gonna give her problems cuz", "09:59", "if you watch like the Miesha Tate fight", "10:00", "Miesha Tate like even though she beat me", "10:03", "should take twice me should take gave", "10:05", "her a hard time there's some good", "10:06", "scrambles Miesha Tate hit her with some", "10:08", "punches if a man that hits you with", "10:10", "punches like that you're fucked you", "10:12", "can't make mistakes you're in trouble", "10:14", "yeah like in a lot of way she's like a", "10:16", "female rumble in that she might not be", "10:18", "able to close the show with one shot", "10:20", "like Rumble Ken but if you make mistakes", "10:22", "you get stung so bad and you see it with", "10:26", "a perfect example she cracked Sarah with", "10:29", "the right hand you see her her whole", "10:31", "face is like what if like nobody hits", "10:33", "them like that nobody and she's long a", "10:36", "man that catches you on the end of those", "10:38", "punches too she she's great at distance", "10:41", "I also think that the game's evolving so", "10:44", "fast yeah where Amanda all she cares", "10:47", "about is being champ all she does is", "10:48", "train that's the only thing she gives a", "10:50", "fuck about I think we saw the same thing", "10:52", "in the Dominick Cruz a Cody garb and", "10:55", "fight all Cody wants to do is be champ", "10:57", "Dominic's doing analysts work he is for", "10:59", "the so I think there's there's this kind", "11:01", "of change of hands right now where", "11:03", "you're seeing these guys who work there", "11:05", "and that's what you have to do to beat", "11:07", "up in this game in this day and age guys", "11:08", "are too good", "11:09", "they're too good now think you're dead",
