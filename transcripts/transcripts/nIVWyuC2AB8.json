reason for", "43:49", "us to be smart as we possibly can with", "43:50", "our training", "43:51", "yes 100 that's what i was going to get", "43:53", "into this um", "43:55", "that you there is a way to train hard", "43:58", "but save your body from especially", "44:01", "critical damage like brain damage", "44:03", "there is a way to do that and dwayne has", "44:05", "been a savior to me because of that", "44:07", "you know dwayne with his experience of", "44:08", "fighting and being through the gyms and", "44:10", "him probably going too hard himself", "44:12", "we've learned a lot of uh", "44:14", "hard drilling and and life drilling", "44:17", "through him that is probably going to", "44:19", "prolong my career and", "44:20", "hopefully my life and and not going as", "44:22", "hard and just spawn", "44:23", "because like before before dwayne when i", "44:24", "was at alpha we sparred like three four", "44:26", "times a week we just went", "44:27", "you know that's what we did we were", "44:28", "wrestlers and that's how we knew how to", "44:30", "get better was just go", "44:31", "and then he came in and started teaching", "44:33", "us like how to drill and how to", "44:35", "to really get better and your reaction", "44:37", "times everything with", "44:38", "with fighting without having to beat", "44:39", "yourself up so much my injuries were", "44:41", "less i wasn't getting injured as much", "44:43", "um and i actually got a lot better too", "44:46", "yeah i think sparring is critical i", "44:48", "think it is important but i think", "44:50", "maybe as critical or maybe more is", "44:52", "drilling", "44:53", "and this is with all martial arts", "44:55", "including jiu jitsu and jiu jitsu", "44:58", "it's you know you know you do jiu jitsu", "44:59", "it's fun so everybody wants to just slap", "45:01", "hands", "45:02", "punch knuckles and start rolling because", "45:04", "it's fun yeah it's fun", "45:06", "it's like a fun game you're doing it's a", "45:07", "good release yeah", "45:09", "but the best way to get better at it is", "45:11", "to constantly drill", "45:13", "and then you develop these pathways that", "45:15", "are just ingrained in your subconscious", "45:17", "and so", "45:18", "when you're in that half guard position", "45:20", "you immediately go for that underhook", "45:21", "you immediately you know the path", "45:23", "you know where to go instead of ad", "45:25", "libbing and thinking while you're in the", "45:26", "middle of a roll", "45:27", "and when you see guys that come from", "45:30", "camps where they don't drill they only", "45:31", "do like one technique at the beginning", "45:32", "of the class you'll notice a technical", "45:34", "deficiency", "45:35", "as opposed to like someone who comes", "45:37", "from hicks in school or someone who", "45:39", "comes from a school that's very", "45:40", "technical or you know the mendez", "45:42", "brothers or something", "45:43", "you know though it's just it's so", "45:45", "important to", "45:46", "look at this look at the sport whether", "45:49", "it's mma or", "45:50", "kickboxing or jiu jitsu whatever it is", "45:52", "but to look at it like a", "45:54", "like a puzzle like you're trying to", "45:55", "figure out what's the best way to solve", "45:58", "this", "45:58", "and you know what dwayne has done for", "46:01", "you", "46:02", "it's been pretty remarkable as far as", "46:03", "like giving you", "46:05", "footwork skills and tools to move around", "46:08", "and angles and i you know i've watched", "46:10", "you guys straight", "46:10", "drill and train together it's really", "46:12", "amazing stuff", "46:14", "yeah stuff that we think is simple and", "46:15", "then we go and teach another gym and", "46:17", "there's like wait what can you guys do", "46:18", "that like ten more times we need to see", "46:20", "that again it's like oh", "46:21", "right all right so we've just been doing", "46:23", "like the footwork i've created with", "46:24", "dwayne", "46:25", "he wasn't a footwork guy when he fought", "46:27", "he was straightforward", "46:29", "and then like he's the one that's", "46:30", "created all these angles with me and now", "46:31", "we've created a whole new style", "46:33", "it's so funny that he saw that kind of", "46:36", "while he was fighting and then after he", "46:37", "was fighting he's implementing it on new", "46:39", "fighters and", "46:40", "didn't do it himself yeah he laughs", "46:42", "about it yeah", "46:43", "he he wishes he probably had someone", "46:45", "like himself coach him obviously", "46:47", "fucking for sure yeah everybody does", "46:50", "yeah", "46:50", "yeah he's a fucking wizard man he is", "46:52", "because he doesn't stop thinking about", "46:53", "it

"out i mean so i'm", "70:22", "i'm doing that i'll do hyperbaric", "70:23", "chamber i'll do cryotherapy", "70:25", "how often do you do the hyperbaric", "70:27", "chamber um only when i need it", "70:29", "because it can mess with your um your", "70:32", "hematocrit you know if i'm i do a lot of", "70:34", "altitude training as well too", "70:36", "i'm trying to increase my red blood cell", "70:37", "count and my hematocrit um and then when", "70:39", "you go and you get into a", "70:41", "hybrid chamber you're breathing 100", "70:43", "oxygen so if i'm in it too much", "70:45", "right i'll lower my hematocrit right but", "70:48", "i do a lot of he has a has the altitude", "70:50", "same as an altitude machine he has me", "70:52", "used it's called", "70:52", "auto lab um i breathe into it for a", "70:55", "certain amount of time that's again", "70:56", "another program he created", "70:58", "the company was around but he created", "70:59", "the program that i'm supposed to do", "71:01", "to put my body in a hypoxic state for", "71:03", "only a certain amount of time", "71:05", "because you can overtrain yourself that", "71:06", "way as well too to", "71:08", "increase my capillaries increase the", "71:11", "date", "71:12", "of vasodilation in my veins as well as", "71:14", "increase red blood increase", "71:16", "increase red blood cells that's amazing", "71:18", "because you know one of the things", "71:19", "that's a big", "71:21", "well i don't know if it's a", "71:22", "misconception but it's one of the things", "71:24", "that people always talk about is that", "71:26", "you should train at altitude and you did", "71:29", "that you went to denver and a lot of", "71:30", "people do that and they find benefits", "71:32", "in that but the thought process now", "71:35", "seems to be", "71:36", "that you get more work done at sea level", "71:39", "exactly so i thought", "71:40", "the same thing and then i met sam and i", "71:42", "and i actually felt this but i didn't", "71:43", "understand it but your body can't", "71:45", "recover the same", "71:46", "or you can't push as hard right at", "71:48", "altitude", "71:49", "um and your body actually gets more", "71:51", "dense at sea level when you're working", "71:53", "out you're able to push harder and your", "71:54", "recovery is better", "71:55", "um and same reason why i think sleeping", "71:58", "in altitude wouldn't help either", "71:59", "because your body won't recover", "72:00", "completely um so i feel better training", "72:03", "at sea level", "72:04", "but i use this alto lab for only a", "72:06", "certain amount of time", "72:08", "on and off with breathing uh techniques", "72:10", "and i felt the best of the best", "72:12", "benefits with that so so what does this", "72:13", "thing look like", "72:16", "it's uh yeah yeah it's just a mask and", "72:19", "it's got a bunch of cylinders on it and", "72:20", "the more cylinders you stack on it the", "72:23", "the more it's uh emulating the uh", "72:26", "the altitude so it's like breathing at", "72:28", "40 000 feet when you stack a lot of them", "72:30", "on there", "72:31", "and so you're you're", "72:34", "hooked up to this thing how yeah so you", "72:36", "just breathe gas mask on it yeah you", "72:38", "could use that where it's just like a", "72:39", "snorkel", "72:40", "right or it could be a gas mask kind of", "72:41", "thing and you're doing it while you're", "72:43", "training", "72:43", "no no no not doing it while i'm training", "72:45", "i'm doing it while i'm", "72:46", "resting on certain days like a certain", "72:49", "schedule i can't do it all the time so", "72:50", "this thing without training", "72:52", "this thing jacks up your your cardio yes", "72:55", "it'll it'll help with your what do i buy", "72:57", "one of these", "72:59", "i'll delay so you just you just breathe", "73:02", "yeah but i'd have to give you the the um", "73:05", "technique because you can", "73:06", "overdo it as well and you can end up", "73:08", "hurting yourself as well too and", "73:09", "how long do you do it for it says here", "73:11", "10 minutes", "73:13", "or 60 minutes and then there's a", "73:16", "program initial 15-day program and our", "73:19", "breathing session will produce", "73:20", "performance effects", "73:21", "that last up to three weeks jesus", "73:24", "wow so for a 60-minute session six", "73:27", "10-minute sessions 10 minute what's", "73:30", "wrong with my voice six", "73:32", "ten minute sessions or ten minutes so", "73:34", "you do six minutes on four minutes off", "73:36", "so six six per hour", "73:39", "and so you're basically doing these", "73:41", "intervals where you're just breathing", "73:44", "yeah and it's one of those things so you", "73:46", "have a you have an oxygen um", "73:48", "reader on your finger tells your oxygen", "73:50", "levels because you want to put yourself", "73:51", "in a hypoxic state right and there's", "73:52", "certain levels that sam wants me to keep", "73:54", "my body out you just want me to go too", "73:55", "low either because your body will start", "73:57", "producing a hormone that", "73:58", "tells you you're dying oh jesus yeah and", "74:01", "so juan archuleta when i first met him i", "74:04", "was coaching an ultimate fighter came", "74:06", "out and told me he's like hey man i've", "74:07", "been breathing this thing sam tells me", "74:08", "to do it i'm like all right", "74:09", "what do i do he's like just get your", "74:10", "levels as low as you can", "74:12", "cool i ended up passing out because you", "74:15", "yeah so", "74:17", "i'm you know me i'm very competitive", "74:19", "right and i was like i was looking at it", "74:20", "you're supposed to do", "74:21", "six minutes and i'm like oh i got like", "74:22", "30 seconds left but it's getting hard", "74:24", "like i can make the", "74:25", "the rest 30 seconds next thing i", "74:27", "remember i'm like seizuring on the couch", "74:29", "i fling this oxygen monitor off my", "74:31", "finger and then i wake up a couple", "74:32", "minutes later i'm like oh shit i passed", "74:34", "out you know", "74:35", "wow you can yeah you don't want to do", "74:38", "too much yeah 40 000 feet seems a little", "74:40", "excessive", "74:41", "yeah yeah but it seems like it would be", "74:42", "amazing for hikers too or someone who", "74:44", "does want to climb everest or something", "74:46", "like that you can acclimate yourself to", "74:47", "the person that started i think they", "74:48", "started it for some sort of disease", "74:50", "and obviously everyone runs with it for", "74:53", "um getting better", "74:54", "results i'm buying one of those", "74:55", "motherfuckers if i can get better", "74:56", "endurance just sitting here", "74:58", "i mean but it's worked though dude like", "74:59", "you'll end up oh yeah you'll sweat", "75:01", "sometimes from it too yeah", "75:02", "so it's just because it's hard to", "75:04", "breathe with the thing yeah so you want", "75:05", "to get", "75:06", "uh yeah i mean you're not getting", "75:07", "sometimes i have to like pull off and", "75:09", "get some fresh air and then get back on", "75:10", "to it like you want to keep your levels", "75:11", "at it because you want to go too low", "75:12", "again", "75:13", "you'll pass out and is it a breathing", "75:15", "exercise like are you doing anything are", "75:16", "you pushing", "75:17", "you learn yeah you learn how to breath a", "75:20", "fire type stuff you learn how to get the", "75:22", "carbon dioxide out of your body as well", "75:23", "too like you really learn a lot about", "75:25", "breathing when you're doing this thing", "75:26", "because you have the oxygen monitor on", "75:27", "your finger", "75:28", "and when you want to increase your", "75:30", "oxygen levels i'll let more air out", "75:31", "right but if i want to decrease my", "75:33", "oxygen levels faster i'll take shallow", "75:35", "breaths", "75:36", "and i can learn that i can get my body", "75:37", "in a hypoxic state faster by doing it", "75:39", "but then when i need to like get more", "75:40", "oxygen in my body i'll make sure to", "75:42", "excel more the carbon monoxide and then", "75:44", "breathe in more air so you kind of it", "75:46", "does teach you how to breathe better as", "75:47", "well too", "75:48", "and then you're creating more", "75:48", "capillaries more lung strength a lot of", "75:51", "stuff so no he's gonna be mad at me", "75:52", "probably

"76:19", "it'll weaken the structural integrity of", "76:20", "my nose and because i gotta like carve", "76:22", "out the", "76:23", "because my nose inside is just crooked", "76:25", "so i'd have to
