the whole", "47:25", "octagon to really appreciate what's", "47:27", "going on you know sometimes you need to", "47:29", "see like an elevated shot of the whole", "47:30", "space because her ability

which I think", "47:51", "there's a good reason for because most", "47:53", "people are throwing that's been in", "47:54", "backfist with their arms straight and", "47:55", "then breaking the forearm right was when", "47:57", "she throws is she's throwing it with her", "47:58", "elbow down which means that if she hits", "48:00", "with the forearm he's hitting both bones", "48:02", "interesting yes best that that's the", "48:04", "reason she does it you might be right I", "48:07", "mean it makes sense", "48:08", "the it is harder to break the bone that", "48:11", "way right and I would think so is it", "48:14", "though let me think just think if that", "48:17", "makes sense you've got to think hitting", "48:18", "one bone is gonna be wicked but if you", "48:20", "block it you want to block it with the", "48:22", "edge you never want to block it like", "48:24", "that I'll give you blocking a kick you", "48:26", "don't want to take it like that that's", "48:27", "how your arm snaps one

seems like", "48:51", "here's gonna", "48:51", "folks who listening we're describing the", "48:54", "outside blade of the bone which would be", "48:57", "like the edge of a 2x4 versus the flat",

so", "49:08", "the lesson is yeah I think the problem", "49:10", "is actually catching it flat like you're", "49:13", "it's one of those things where it's it's", "49:16", "not the bone the size

that scale ah dude if there was", "53:52", "cockroaches and and fucking giant bugs", "53:55", "the size of dogs running around we would", "53:57", "have real problems real problem real", "53:59",

here it is", "54:27", "so one of them gets infected and the", "54:30", "other ones are gonna carry this dude", "54:31", "away because if they don't", "54:32", "he starts growing shit on his head it's", "54:35", "like this this fungus somehow or another", "54:38", "gets into his body and it starts", "54:41", "sprouting this mushroom out of the top", "54:44", "of his head and we're looking at a slow", "54:46", "motion version of this we're seeing this", "54:49", "thing sprout out of this dead ants head", "54:51", "if this took three weeks to film this", "54:54", "yeah dude this is like a science fiction", "54:56", "movie it's just they're operating on the", "54:59", "different time scale but if that", "55:00", "happened as quickly as you're watching", "55:01", "it in this video you freak the fuck out", "55:03", "we're gonna say explode growing so quick", "55:06", "is it gonna explode is that the grand", "55:08", "finale I don't know I think that's the", "55:11", "idea though yeah that's yeah it explodes", "55:14", "out of its head is what they're sort of", "55:18", "somatic but I think it does blow spores", "55:21", "I think some of them yeah see some of", "55:24", "them like fill up and then spores blow", "55:26", "out of them and those spores can infect", "55:28", "other ends that's why they were removed", "55:30", "from the colony if you're biologists i", "55:32", "strong sincerely apologize butchering", "55:35", "all science that's how I spent my summer", "55:37", "across there are exploding ants though", "55:39", "well they literally explode no no it's", "55:42", "it's like a hole they explode but their", "55:45", "nests lived to see another day their", "55:47", "abdomen are up sir", "55:48", "oh the whole fungi well did you ever see", "55:51", "what they do with leaf cutter ants uh-uh", "55:54", "so ruthless the women are so monstrous", "55:58", "they chop off the man's arm fuck him to", "56:00", "death they they chop off his arms and", "56:03",

bitch and they cut his arms off", "56:13", "and then they bring him somewhere to", "56:15", "fuck them make sure this is true I'm", "56:19", "pretty sure it's true I watched this old", "56:22", "documentary I remember they were", "56:23", "snipping off the arms and legs of the", "56:26", "amp and then they carried him away", "56:28", "imagine that's fucking terrifying dude", "56:31", "they're like this is how we know how to", "56:33", "do it like this is how we do it we cut", "56:35", "off your arms and legs then we fuck you", "56:36", "to death imagine how that changes", "56:37",

the other shit that", "57:12", "we add on to it well we've made", "57:14", "ourselves so safe and so removed from", "57:16", "the whole cycle of life and that's", "57:19", "amazing that we've done that or that", "57:20", "somebody other than us has done that and", "57:22", "then we reap the benefits but because of", "57:25", "that we look at real the real suffering", "57:27", "of the natural world almost like is if", "57:29", "it's preventable or if it's bad or if", "57:31", "it's you know something we should be sad", "57:34", "about you know but there's some really", "57:37", "horrific things that take place", "57:39", "especially in the insect world on a", "57:41", "daily basis that make you just go what", "57:44", "like have you ever seen those Hornets", "57:46", "that fly into the honey bee nests and", "57:48", "yeah head everyone I have seen that", "57:50", "that's terrifying", "57:51", "but it's like a Japanese Hornet right", "57:53", "and they fly in and just a few of them", "57:56", "and there are good sizes oh I in my name", "57:59", "you won't want any bigger hedge cutters", "58:00", "for a face and they just come in and", "58:03", "chop the heads off of these fucking and", "58:04", "these these other honeybees and it's", "58:06", "crazy to watch man because the honeybees", "58:08", "can't do jack shit there's hundreds of", "58:11", "them and it's just getting slaughtered", "58:12", "just thousands of them but then they", "58:14", "figured out the way to kill these things", "58:16", "is to get on top of them and bat their", "58:19", "wings to heat up so they heat up to the", "58:22", "point where it overheats the bee and", "58:25", "kills it or the Hornet and kills it how", "58:27", "did they figure that out how did they", "58:29", "figure that out but that's their", "58:30", "strategy now their strategy is they", "58:32", "swarm all over the Hornet and they just", "58:35", "keep flapping their wings until they", "58:37", "overheat that motherfucker that's the", "58:38", "argument for collective consciousness", "58:40", "cuz like someone figured that out one of", "58:42", "those one of those honey bees figured", "58:44", "that out and then the rest of them", "58:45", "around the world probably started using", "58:47", "that same tactic probably yeah well", "58:50", "that's the Rupert Sheldrake thought is", "58:52", "that the sweet potatoes in there well", "58:54", "he's uh he's he had this theory called", "58:58", "morphic resonance and he one of the", "59:02", "things that he was saying was he was", "59:04", "talking about studies they did with rats", "59:06", "and mazes and then if they did a study", "59:08", "with a rat in a maze like on the East", "59:10", "Coast rats on the west coast if they", "59:14", "went through the same maze would get", "59:16", "through a quicker hmm so it's like they", "59:18", "were learning from each other how to get", "59:20", "through it's almost like they were", "59:22", "sharing yeah some sort of an", "59:23", "understanding I mean we want to think", "59:27", "that all genetics are the same in terms", "59:30", "of like you know you have a child and", "59:32", "your child shares your wife's genetics", "59:34", "and your genetics and this is this is", "59:36", "how it works and this is this is the way", "59:38", "people learn things and that might be", "59:40", "the way we learn most things but it also", "59:43", "might be that we're getting some", "59:45", "information from each other in some", "59:47", "weird way and go to be and we but we", "59:50", "might be a little too detached from it", "59:51", "whereas rats or out there fucking", "59:53", "scratch and claw and they don't have a", "59:55", "language they might be completely tuned", "59:57", "into it", "59:57", "might be the sacrifice that language but", "60:01", "that we made when we went with language", "60:03", "where we lost our ability to read each", "60:07", "other the way we used to order to read", "60:09", "thoughts and ideas where we used to we", "60:11", "rely instead on this other thing so it's", "60:14", "sort of like when you wear shoes all the", "60:16", "time your feet get soft for sure we've", "60:19", "done a lot of things to detach ourselves", "60:21", "from all of that stuff yeah and I mean", "60:22", "like and I think you know people that", "60:25", "like wim HOF and Tim shieff and people", "60:28", "like that that kind of go back to as far", "60:31", "as clothes back to nature as they can", "60:32", "they must be tuning back into something", "60:34", "that we're lacking I always feel that", "60:36", "like that I want to get closer to that", "60:38", "resonance and I do feel like this is the", "60:40", "study with the the monkeys on the", "60:42", "islands the archipelago and they drop", "60:44", "sweet potatoes in the sand have you have", "60:46", "you heard this I think so but good so", "60:48", "they drop sweet potatoes in I mean I'm", "60:50", "this is just a a gathering of why I", "60:54", "remember from reading the study but", "60:55", "there was a series of islands all with", "60:57", "the same species of monkey on the", "60:58", "islands they dropped sweet potatoes into", "61:01", "the sand on one Island and the monkeys", "61:03", "went over and bit into them and because", "61:04", "they were covered in sand they spat them", "61:06", "out and left them some of the younger", "61:08", "monkeys realized that if they took them", "61:09", "into the sea they could wash the sand", "61:11", "off and then they cleave the sweet", "61:12", "potatoes and then when they dropped the", "61:14", "sweet potatoes onto the successive", "61:15", "islands they'd already knew to wash them", "61:18", "in the sea oh right so that's very", "61:21", "similar the Rupert Sheldrake thing", "61:22", "that's really interesting yeah yeah I", "61:25", "really wonder I mean I really wonder how", "61:28", "much like the human race benefits from", "61:31", "the collective knowledge of everyone", "61:33", "involved not just through the internet", "61:34", "in books and in universities but maybe", "61:37", "even just through consciousness like", "61:39", "maybe there's some element of it that's", "61:41", "being relayed through consciousness see", "61:43", "I'm invested in it because if I have an", "61:45", "idea I automatically think that that", "61:47", "idea is now available to everybody else", "61:49", "so I need to jump on that ship pretty", "61:50", "quick so I use it as like oh yeah we", "61:53", "have motivated myself yeah for sure", "61:55", "right and if you you know if you have an", "61:58", "idea do you ever wonder where it's", "62:00", "coming from", "62:01", "mmm where is that oh this is that I've", "62:05", "but I've had experience I've to work", "62:08", "mushrooms all the time and", "62:10", "to work with him mushrooms yeah same", "62:12", "laissez-moi yeah same office you know", "62:14", "they're called puzzles over a", "62:15", "colleague's you know and I will", "62:19", "mushrooms I worked with him I always", "62:20", "felt like I was downloading stuff I", "62:22", "always felt like it was being poured", "62:23", "into my head", "62:24", "yeah from somewhere else very similar a", "62:28", "lot of people have very similar", "62:29", "experiences so I always feel like I'm", "62:32", "receiving it from someone else and I", "62:33", "think that's it's a good way of kind of", "62:35", "detaching myself from it ownership of it", "62:38", "yeah Steven Pressfield wrote about that", "62:40", "in a really unique way in the war of art", "62:41", "because you talked about how just", "62:44", "showing up and counting on the muse like", "62:46", "thinking about the muses a real thing", "62:48", "you know the muse has always been like", "62:50", "some the idea is like something's coming", "62:53", "to you with these ideas something like", "62:55", "something magical right and so I think", "62:57", "his idea is to treat it like it is", "62:59", "magical and respect it and it show up", "63:01", "every day at work at the same time and", "63:04", "and summon the muse and then if you did", "63:07", "just do that with discipline and you act", "63:09", "as a professional all this stuff comes", "63:11", "to you where does it come from well", "63:13", "let's just say it comes from the muse it", "63:15", "might not let's just say it does treat", "63:17", "it like it does and it works out like", "63:19", "that's it's one of those weird ones", "63:21", "whereas if you pretend it's magic it", "63:23", "kind of works like magic mm-hmm but if", "63:25", "you just analyze it loser drips neurons", "63:27", "firing in my brain the collective work", "63:30", "of all these other people of ever", "63:31", "experiencing movies and literature", "63:32", "they're all feeling through me so let's", "63:35", "not get carried away about the", "63:36", "pretentiousness of creativity might be", "63:39", "pretentious my people attentions think", "63:41", "that way but you might be open to the", "63:43", "idea that let's just pretend that's", "63:45", "magic", "63:46",

some people think", "81:46", "he's still won the fight", "81:47", "yeah how'd ya what do you think just", "81:49", "have to go watch it again and try to", "81:50", "score it I think when whenever is a", "81:53", "close fight there's like sometimes I", "81:55", "like the way a certain type of fighter", "81:58", "the way they like I prefer someone who's", "82:02", "doing damage versus someone to take", "82:04", "someone down it doesn't do anything", "82:05", "right and sometimes you'll have a", "82:08", "kickboxer who's lighting a guy up for", "82:10", "like the first minute and a half of the", "82:12", "round", "82:12", "but then the wrestler take them down", "82:14", "maybe stay on top of them for three or", "82:15", "four minutes but don't do anything and", "82:16", "they'll give it to the wrestler yes", "82:18", "which I'm like okay maybe but it's I", "82:21", "think it's debatable especially if it's", "82:23", "50/50 like two and a half minutes down", "82:25", "two and a half minutes up well what", "82:26", "happened in those two and a half minutes", "82:28", "downs yes you held position but did you", "82:31", "get it back from what that guy was doing", "82:33", "to you in the first two and a half", "82:34", "minutes when he was chopping at your", "82:36", "legs and kicking you in the body like I", "82:38", "don't know where to score that and I", "82:40", "think it's not really it's not really", "82:43", "clear it's too subjective no it's over", "82:45", "opinion based really yeah you know and", "82:48", "it's down to the interpretation of the", "82:49", "person watching and this is how your own", "82:51", "personal life experiences come into play", "82:53", "if you're a sport jiu-jitsu guy you're", "82:54", "gonna see it different to a you know a", "82:56", "boxing coach or something like that and", "82:58", "the other thing as well when it comes to", "83:00", "like the stats and you look at the total", "83:02", "strikes landed significant strikes", "83:03", "landed I always argue some strikes are", "83:06", "far more significant than others sure", "83:08", "like if you land fifty significant", "83:10", "strikes in a round sorry and in a fight", "83:13", "and someone lands ten significant", "83:15", "strikes but those 10 significant strikes", "83:17", "blow your blow your eye out break your", "83:19", "nose knock you down one time it doesn't", "83:21", "matter what the other significant", "83:23", "strikes did if they weren't as", "83:24", "significant and I think like with the", "83:26", "Mike Perry Vicente Luque fight I would", "83:29", "say that that knee was probably the most", "83:31", "significant strike of the fight so I'm", "83:32", "gonna weigh that so much heavier than", "83:35", "then it areas the other significant", "83:36", "strikes it's you know means yeah 100%", "83:38", "agree with you I think we're living in", "83:41", "this compromise of the 10-point must", "83:43", "system that we don't have to be what", "83:45", "about the way that pride used to do", "83:47", "where they would score the person", "83:48", "finishing stronger as a heavier because", "83:50", "that's another argument that comes in if", "83:52", "you look at Mike Perry at the end of", "83:53", "that third round you go fourth round", "83:55", "fifth round he's got nothing left like", "83:57", "that nose is a mess", "83:58", "hmm so then I think instinctively I do", "84:01", "that and I try not to I do try and score", "84:03", "it per round but I think instinctively", "84:05", "if somebody finishes stronger which", "84:07", "again you're Romero against Robert", "84:09", "Whittaker and things I'm around", "84:10", "he finished stronger than Whitaker by", "84:12", "you know quite obviously yeah and I", "84:14", "think that people naturally lean towards", "84:16", "the person that is they've overcome the", "84:18", "hump but start the fight it's almost", "84:20", "like you've you've got a round or two to", "84:22", "you can kind of forgive the person and", "84:23", "they before they take over well here's", "84:25", "perfect example the first round with Liz", "84:27", "Carmouche and Valentina Shevchenko that", "84:30", "was a fairly uneventful round in terms", "84:32", "of significant strikes landed in terms", "84:35", "of anybody establishing any dominance", "84:37", "you just got to see Valentina dealing", "84:39", "with the movement and advancing and", "84:41", "landing a little bit more than Liz but", "84:42", "that's it not much right but that's a", "84:45", "10-9 round but show how could it Brown", "84:47", "where they're scrapping and they're", "84:48", "going at each other but no one gets", "84:49", "knocked down but fucking wild chaotic", "84:51", "crazy round how can that also be a 10-9", "84:53", "round yeah right yeah I hear you but", "84:56", "then but that's see that's where that's", "84:58", "where people's perspective of fights can", "84:59", "can sometimes you know lean one way", "85:01", "because if somebody has a really really", "85:03", "big last round but they've lost the", "85:05", "first two mm-hmm", "85:06", "people are not seeing it as in as three", "85:08", "sections of a fight to be scored if one", "85:10", "person to two rounds ahead sometimes", "85:12", "like it like a psycho saying", "85:14", "instinctively if someone has a strong", "85:16", "round you score towards that person", "85:18", "because it was more impactful what they", "85:19", "did to their opponent yes so if you take", "85:22", "someone down and control them and hold", "85:23", "them even if you do that for four", "85:25", "minutes of around but for one minute of", "85:27", "that round you get lit up against the", "85:28", "fence I'm always gonna go towards the", "85:31", "person that was doing the light and up", "85:32", "but yes that was more significant and", "85:34", "more impactful on me as a viewer if I'm", "85:36", "choosing a tribal leader I'm going for", "85:39", "the guy that had the one minute of", "85:40", "success on the feet as opposed to the", "85:41", "guy that was holding him down for four", "85:43", "yeah unless the guy who holds him down", "85:45", "eventually mountain's him like from Game", "85:47", "of Thrones and crushes his fucking head", "85:49", "with his thumb through his eyeballs girl", "85:51", "I was terrifying that was terrifying", "85:54", "yeah I see your point", "85:55", "I guess but I think for sure that there", "85:59", "should be another category of of", "86:01", "impactful strikes instead of just", "86:05", "significant strikes and total strikes", "86:07", "there should probably be rocked like he", "86:10", "got rocked like he got like your legs go", "86:12", "and you know and you're covering up but", "86:15", "then he's a knockdown ultimately a 10-8", "86:17", "round no I don't think ten eight is", "86:19", "right I don't think ten is right I think", "86:21", "we should have a comprehensive system", "86:24", "that recognizes the fact that there's", "86:26", "near submissions there's a leg kick that", "86:29", "barely touches and there's a leg kick", "86:30", "that cripples your leg there they should", "86:32", "be scored differently we should have", "86:34", "like actual numbers that are attributed", "86:36", "to these things we want to have an", "86:38", "accumulation of things", "86:39", "and how much should we count total", "86:41", "strikes how much should we count", "86:43", "submission attempts how much should we", "86:44", "count near submission attempts what", "86:46", "about submission attempts we you're", "86:47", "literally Saved by the Bell which does", "86:49", "happen right you're literally like", "86:52", "locked up ready to fucking tap and that", "86:55", "like um Jen's Pulver Vijay pen that's", "86:57", "the first one that's a good one that's a", "86:59", "good one that comes to my was gonna go", "87:00", "with Dylan Danis his first MMA fight", "87:02", "okay", "87:03", "didn't what wasn't the first one didn't", "87:05", "lock up a Darce and the guy got out of", "87:07", "it and then he caught him with the darts", "87:08", "in the second round is that what", "87:09", "happened or my thing am i misconstruing", "87:11", "him with somebody else I don't remember", "87:12", "but it's that what I'm going with is", "87:15", "there's moments where you go this guy's", "87:18", "fucked and then the buzzer rings and", "87:21", "you're like girl he survived but let's", "87:23", "see what happens if he comes back and", "87:24", "want to say it's telling dance but no", "87:26", "I'm questioning myself I've seen too", "87:28", "many fights yeah so what what about if", "87:31", "they're knocked and rocked right at the", "87:33", "end of the fight like Frankie Edgar", "87:35", "against Greymane hard first round that's", "87:37", "interesting too how much is that worth", "87:39", "right what imagine if the colon had an", "87:42", "opportunity to add an extra minute to", "87:43", "the round extra minute go Oh God well", "87:48", "how about with k1 or glory when they get", "87:51", "to three rounds if it's a draw they go", "87:52", "one more round nobody goes fuck over", "87:58", "gonna sit back and rest right and then", "88:01", "pushes the fighters to be more decisive", "88:02", "time in the first three rounds yes is it", "88:05", "did Dylan Dennis win his first fight in", "88:06", "the first round of second round okay so", "88:09", "I'm dumb so the first one was a leglock", "88:13", "yes so it wasn't him it was somebody", "88:16", "that landed a fucking Darce like a sick", "88:19", "Darce at the end of the first round and", "88:22", "I want to say it wasn't in Bellator now", "88:24", "that thing about was in the UFC that was", "88:26", "a leglock", "88:26", "Dylan dannis who's a top of the food", "88:28", "chain jiu-jitsu practitioner he's he's", "88:31", "there's so many guys that if you're", "88:34",

he's with me our brothers at the", "88:58", "moment oh it's Montel Jackson no I", "89:01", "thinks that's first-round Darce I don't", "89:04", "think that's it because god dammit now", "89:07", "that it wasn't I know it wasn't Dillon", "89:09", "dance I'm trying to see what fucking", "89:10", "jiu-jitsu guy was it that slapped on a", "89:12", "Darce and then finished it the next", "89:15", "round finished it with the dars maybe", "89:18", "it's Ferguson it's not gonna Evie this", "89:23", "is not gonna work I'm never gonna", "89:24", "remember now because it's fairly recent", "89:26", "but there's you know that when when", "89:30", "someone's locked up but we've gotten way", "89:32", "off track but my point was if someone's", "89:34", "locked up into submission and the buzzer", "89:36", "ends you know that guy was fucked he was", "89:38", "fucked he's turning purple and then the", "89:41", "buzzer rings and you guys to let go and", "89:43", "you're like oh he's not attending that", "89:44", "should be worth a lot ten seven I don't", "89:47", "know man it's like you're a couple", "89:48", "seconds away from death yeah that seems", "89:51", "like it should be worth a lot to find it", "89:52", "for me um who is it says what they", "89:56", "dropped it till score second round dark", "89:57", "no no that was one of the most like", "90:01", "obvious Darce choke she'll ever see", "90:03", "Woodley just smushed him yeah he smushed", "90:05", "him but he's so goddamn strong like you", "90:08", "could see that darts coming a mile away", "90:10", "and he's not stopping it he just ran", "90:13", "that fucking arm through and clamped it", "90:15", "on his bicep and crushed him I mean he", "90:17", "didn't try to be sneaky with it he was", "90:19", "just dominant with it it was a that's a", "90:21", "great example of like the top of the", "90:25", "foods that Dennis for me it is it means", "90:27", "perfect life in their own darts I do not", "90:30", "see Phoenix how long ago is this what", "90:38", "year is February um", "90:41", "could be this is UFC Phoenix anyway", "90:46", "doesn't matter the point being if you do", "90:48", "if you do get caught like that if you do", "90:50", "get caught like that and the buzzer", "90:52", "saves your life that should be worth it", "90:54", "what's got to be worth a lot not for", "90:56", "sure not the same as like how is that", "90:59", "ten nine like how do you get a ten nine", "91:01", "out of that that sounds crazy if there's", "91:02", "a 10-9 just like Carmouche and Valentina", "91:04", "Shevchenko in the first round where it's", "91:06", "fairly uneventful yep you know and then", "91:08", "you've got then you've got one round", "91:10", "where the fights and nearly gets", "91:11", "finished and Saved by the Bell and then", "91:12", "their opponent can edge out the next two", "91:15", "rounds by stuffing takedowns and", "91:16", "fighting defensively", "91:17", "yeah they win on decision yeah I really", "91:19", "think that there's the there's room for", "91:23", "growth there's room for improvement and", "91:25", "I think that if someone developed some", "91:28", "sort of a more comprehensive system like", "91:31", "what is a takedown actually worth why do", "91:33", "we have to stick to this ten nine stuff", "91:35", "it's like I guess it's like oh I'm going", "91:38", "this way or I'm going that way let's see", "91:41", "your work like what are you deciding it", "91:43", "on are you deciding on okay", "91:45", "I have takedowns versus submission", "91:48", "attempt and with the accumulation of leg", "91:51", "strikes I feel like an advantage was", "91:53", "gained and even though much wasn't done", "91:55", "with the takedown it did defensively", "91:57", "stop the the attack that he was getting", "91:59", "on his feet and he was able to impose", "92:01", "his will upon him so I'm gonna give him", "92:03", "ten nine we go yeah talk about this and", "92:06", "experts can sit around and try to figure", "92:08", "out what what what makes sense to people", "92:11", "who have been studying martial arts", "92:13", "their whole life what do you think is", "92:15", "worth more who do you think won that", "92:16", "round I forget about the ten nine if you", "92:19", "had a score it and the Dan Hardy system", "92:21", "who do you think won that round and if", "92:23", "we did something like that I think we'd", "92:24", "get at least an idea what the territory", "92:27", "is but were confined by ten nine or ten", "92:30", "eight or ten seven it's like who decides", "92:33", "who decide why is it ten seven this one", "92:35", "isn't and that one is well show me show", "92:37", "me what it is", "92:37", "show me what happened but then we could", "92:39", "have complicates it I see the benefit in", "92:41", "the ten nine thing is it makes it more", "92:43", "of an instinctive thing like for me like", "92:46", "a takedown should be its own reward", "92:47", "like if you take someone down you've put", "92:49", "them in a position where you want them", "92:50", "that's like", "92:51", "achtung and control to me so like", "92:53", "controlling the center should be scored", "92:55", "just as highly as a takedown the", "92:56", "takedowns gotta lead to something oh I", "92:58", "disagree because I think it's easier to", "93:00", "take control the center than it is to", "93:02", "get a takedown I don't agree", "93:03", "honestly how long what footwork in MMA", "93:06", "is is almost primitive really I mean", "93:09", "we've like there are certain people that", "93:10", "stand out they've got really good", "93:11", "footwork but for the most part there's", "93:12", "so many so much bad decision-making by", "93:14", "people not understanding how to corral", "93:16", "someone against the fence this is", "93:18", "example why don't agree", "93:19", "Tyron Woodley versus Wonder Boy right", "93:22", "hiren Woodley let wonderboy control the", "93:25", "center for most of the fight but that's", "93:26", "like playing God to me if you if you", "93:29", "choose to be backed against the fence", "93:30", "and choose to counter-strike you're", "93:31", "losing until you win a lot of the time", "93:33", "but not as much as being taken down", "93:35", "because tyrant wind up doing what he", "93:37", "wanted to do which is catch wonderboy in", "93:39", "between these movements and land a big", "93:41", "shot and he did it in both fights and he", "93:43", "heard him in both fights but both fights", "93:45", "were a similar strategy of waiting for", "93:47", "wonderboy to fuck up and not a whole lot", "93:50", "of volume and definitely don't charge at", "93:52", "that guy ya know save counters takedowns", "93:54", "are definitely worth more than control", "93:56", "accenture I'm not a dummy not to be", "93:57", "misunderstood what I'm saying is that", "93:59", "the the goal is the same thing if you", "94:02", "control the center you'll be putting", "94:04", "someone in a position where you can", "94:05", "strike them if you take someone down", "94:06", "you're putting them in a position where", "94:08", "you can hit them or submit them yeah by", "94:10", "their so removed because when you're", "94:13", "controlling the center you could still", "94:14", "get fucked up like you're not", "94:16", "controlling the guy like if you're", "94:18", "moving forward and you control in the", "94:19", "center it mean you're definitely forcing", "94:21", "the action but people get knocked out",

and", "115:52", "because he because he'd programmed his", "115:54", "fighter so well it was just a it was", "115:56", "pure it was a responsive thing same with", "115:58", "Matt humor and DJ yes and like obviously", "116:01", "this is some level of freedom and", "116:02", "creativity for the fighter but they've", "116:04", "always got that backup that person in", "116:06", "the corner that can tell them something", "116:07", "and they know exactly what they mean and", "116:09", "they just apply it and it works you know", "116:11", "and like those those systems come into", "116:14", "play and all the codes that are coming", "116:15", "in now is it's interesting it's an", "116:17", "interesting development I think I think", "116:20", "that those kind of fighters will always", "116:22",

"and then he just struck on that pattern", "117:18", "and hit paydirt any like Jesus Christ", "117:21", "yeah it's like max Holloway does it now", "117:23", "that first round he's like he's down", "117:25", "load round yeah I know he gathers he", "117:27", "gathers information he studies their", "117:29", "patterns and that's why if you look at", "117:31", "max Holloway stats he's first round he's", "117:33", "percentage", "117:34", "of success he's loved and his output", "117:35", "slow but then as these success rate", "117:38", "increases so does his output he's", "117:40", "ridiculous

keep", "118:06", "that up for the longest because Kobe can", "118:08", "keep that shit up for five rounds he's", "118:10", "done an amazing job of getting people to", "118:13", "dismiss him because they think he's a", "118:14", "piece of shit with his Maggie had and", "118:19", "all the trash that he does it's fucking", "118:21", "brilliant man because what he's done is", "118:24", "just insult everybody and anybody get a", "118:26", "lot of people talking about him and then", "118:29", "fuck people up so it's like whoa this is", "118:32", "a crazy combination because it fucks", "118:34",

a", "118:43", "slight I don't know depending upon the", "118:45", "person but it at least slight burden and", "118:48", "experiencing that from a person it might", "118:50", "be a big burden maybe you're one of", "118:51", "those people that has a hard time", "118:52", "getting fucked with and you can't is", "118:54", "keeps you up at night and then it's like", "118:56", "a maybe maybe it diminishes your", "118:57", "performance 20% maybe 30% yeah", "119:00", "and Colby doesn't get tired he keeps", "119:03", "coming it's terrifying Robbie Lawler", "119:07", "just kept bobbing and weaving and hoping", "119:08", "for these openings that were never there", "119:10", "uh-huh", "119:11", "didn't you call me just on you he was", "119:12", "punching some ridiculous amount like one",

"119:31", "was kind of coasting for a couple of", "119:32", "rounds with the intention of getting", "119:33", "started later hmm but then I just I just", "119:36", "think the the intensity of Colby has", "119:38", "burned him out faster than he expected", "119:40", "I think when you're an explosive guy", "119:42", "like Robbie is where he fires fucking", "119:45", "hurricane speed", "119:47",

that fuck", "120:31", "with you plus he's a great fighter", "120:34", "so the meanness the shit talking all the", "120:37", "the magus tough the strippers the cringe", "120:40", "you're like oh my god right and then on", "120:43", "top of it the fucking output inside the", "120:46", "Octagon you're like shit he's doing all", "120:48", "that n he's fucking me up he might have", "120:50", "fucked me up even if he didn't do all", "120:52", "that but he does all that and I don't", "120:53", "want to lose to him and he's fucking me", "120:55", "up it's like damn do you think there's a", "120:57", "point where Kobe thinks you know any", "120:59", "point during his training camp like", "121:01", "Sherriff stack the odds against myself", "121:03", "here I had that moment before Marcus", "121:05", "Davis where I thought to myself if I", "121:06", "lose here I'm gonna like it", "121:08", "I'm gonna look really fucking stupid I", "121:09", "think that Kobe is doing a brilliant job", "121:13", "of playing a bad guy like pro wrestling", "121:16", "style and I think he didn't used to do", "121:18", "that early in his career he was a", "121:19", "hard-working guy who just went out there",

become", "121:30", "the interim welterweight champion he's", "121:32", "one of the most talked about guys in the", "121:33", "sport he took on a character that's what", "121:36", "I think and I think that character is", "121:37", "super successful if fucking with people", "121:39", "you know I mean and he can fucking fight", "121:43", "man yeah you can't underestimate that", "121:46", "that kind of car do the cardio is crazy", "121:49", "to be able do that for five rounds", "121:51", "that's bananas that that pace is insane", "121:54", "yeah I'm Robbie Lola stand strong", "121:57", "as well he's such a difficult person to", "121:59", "hold down I wonder whether I wonder", "122:01", "whether Robbie Lola left some of his", "122:02", "training camp you know whether he left", "122:03", "some of his effort in the gym I would", "122:05", "imagine Robbie Lowell is the kind of guy", "122:07", "that still trains like he's in his", "122:08", "twenties", "122:09", "like he's like on it every day well", "122:11", "maybe or maybe they train together and", "122:14", "when they trained together Kobe was", "122:16", "getting the best of it I mean I think", "122:18", "they did train together at American Top", "122:19", "Team you know maybe Kobe knew that he", "122:22", "get out wrestling he knew if he just", "122:23", "stayed on him he would break him and out", "122:25", "wrestle him I mean when someone has an", "122:27", "arresting advantage it goes back to this", "122:29", "one more time someone has a wrestling", "122:31", "advantage that is a big deal when you", "122:33", "start getting tired and this guy has", "122:34", "better technique than you and he's not", "122:36", "as tired as you are because he's", "122:38", "fighting more efficiently and then he", "122:39", "gets ahold of you and then fuck him on", "122:41", "my back and then you like goddammit and", "122:44", "then you try to get back up but you", "122:45", "can't and the bells over and you get", "122:46", "back on you are got to keep this guy", "122:48", "from taking me down then boom he takes", "122:49", "you down to Dan again he keeps punching", "122:51", "you on the feet it keeps hitting you and", "122:53", "making you move backwards and you're", "122:55", "just looking to land this big bomb but", "122:56", "there's never an opening for it you", "122:58", "think he's gonna slow down but he never", "122:59", "does so Colby against could be but a", "123:01", "catch wait what do you reckon who", "123:05", "outpaces the other one dude they could", "123:07", "get Ted Nugent to sing enough fuck yeah", "123:12", "I think that's an amazing fight if the", "123:16", "khabib ever did want to fight at 170 i", "123:18", "think him versus Usman would also be an", "123:20", "amazing fight I want to see Colby and", "123:22", "Usman I mean that's the fight right I", "123:24", "mean and I also think if you're going to", "123:27", "have an interim champion you should", "123:29", "treat that fighter like it's a champion", "123:33", "like you can't just take their fight", "123:36", "you can't take their belt away if they", "123:38", "don't want to fight right now because", "123:39", "they're injured or because they need", "123:40", "surgery I think we have to respect the", "123:42", "championship title otherwise people are", "123:45", "going to look at interim championships", "123:47", "like it doesn't mean anything", "123:48", "it should mean as much as a championship", "123:51", "like we're saying you have to fight for", "123:54", "the title next so to say that they don't", "123:56", "have to fight for the title next and", "123:58", "we're just gonna take that thing away", "123:59", "from you", "123:59", "you just take it away like but you still", "124:01", "fight the person still fight it so", "124:03", "there's still the champion they didn't", "124:05", "lose you just take it away because what", "124:07", "is there a mandatory contender that", "124:10", "WBA the WBC the IBF no it's just the UFC", "124:14", "the FC decides like who fights and who", "124:16", "fights when I'm happy that they have", "124:18", "interim interim Championships cuz

vulnerable mm-hmm", "139:11", "yeah then you know we've watched him go", "139:13", "through that process it like in the", "139:15", "moment it's really annoying because we", "139:17", "want to see a mad fight but in hindsight", "139:19", "you can kind of look at it and go well I", "139:21", "appreciate that as part of his journey", "139:22", "now and you know I understand where he", "139:24", "was that you gotta give steep it credit", "139:27", "for taking fucking bombs in that fight I", "139:30", "mean he took bombs in that fight", "139:32", "especially in that first round like fuck", "139:36", "Francis is always in it when he's", "139:38", "standing in front of you when you stand", "139:40", "in front of you he's always in it and", "139:42", "with steep a managed", "139:43", "just

"going and ground him out so here's a", "139:55", "question for you then do you think you", "139:56", "take punches better if you expect the", "139:58", "person to punch hard probably because I", "140:01", "would say that he took bigger punches", "140:02", "from in Ghana in that fight than that", "140:04", "than the punch from DC and I would say", "140:06", "he's probably more vulnerable to the", "140:07", "punch from DC because he probably wasn't", "140:09", "expecting DC to knock him out could be", "140:12", "could be wouldn't expect to get caught", "140:14", "like that in a clinch either there was a", "140:15", "really perfect utilization of the clinch", "140:19", "work combined with that crazy big", "140:21", "overhand right I mean he really set him", "140:24", "up perfectly for that and there was", "140:26", "something that obviously was a part of", "140:27", "his repertoire it was not something that", "140:29", "was just oh it was just happened to be", "140:31", "there for the moment he set him up for", "140:32", "that and that that was just the perfect", "140:35", "right hand and he caught him when he was", "140:36", "looking I mean he just didn't didn't", "140:38", "know that punch was coming clipped him", "140:40", "dropped him put him away the real", "140:42", "question is what's it going to be like", "140:43", "now that he knows that DC could knock", "140:45", "him out I mean is he gonna fight from", "140:47", "the outside try to land big shots he's", "140:49", "gonna avoid the clinch at any cost now", "140:51", "and I've got a big height and reach", "140:53", "advantage can he keep DC off of him yeah", "140:55", "and then also when a fighter has had a", "141:00", "lot of wars like him with Junior dos", "141:03", "Santos the first fight there was a war", "141:05", "right I mean he's had some Wars in his", "141:08", "career street fighting Ghana fights true", "141:11", "fight was a war he's got stopped in that", "141:13", "fight", "141:13", "you know how many the mark hunt fight", "141:16", "right mmm that was a war yeah yes he'd", "141:19", "be dominated right from top position as", "141:21", "well and even the

of those can a fighter have before", "141:32", "we see them start to fade in front of", "141:34", "our eyes and I'm not suggesting that we", "141:36", "saw that with him because he was able to",

"141:47", "it just put him away yeah I'll be", "141:49", "surprised if it happens again first", "141:51", "round I'll be surprised if it happens", "141:52", "again because I think he's he is gonna", "141:54", "be far more respectful of the fact that", "141:56", "DC's got power now", "141:57", "for sure lighting you're 100% right and", "141:59", "like you go back to his UFC debut and", "142:00", "like he did fight long like he used to", "142:03", "used a real good long jab and a low kick", "142:05", "and like recently he's kind of crowded", "142:07", "his work a lot he steps in very close",

firefighter", "142:35", "he's a knockout fighter you mean he", "142:37", "knocked out Verdoux moving backwards", "142:39", "with a perfectly placed right hand he's", "142:42", "a fucking animal I mean

seems", "143:04", "pissed off this week as well good light", "143:06", "like a fighter man has an animal yeah he", "143:11", "seems annoyed I just I wonder whether", "143:13", "that's gonna play into the fight because", "143:14", "I got the impression from him that he'd", "143:16", "not watched the the previous fight I got", "143:19", "the impression that he'd not watched the", "143:20", "first DC for me only yeah so that could", "143:24", "see that concerns because then the idea", "143:26", "of what happened in his head might be", "143:27", "very different to what actually happened", "143:29", "hmm well God do you really think they", "143:33", "would let him not what does that I don't", "143:35", "know I don't know I mean there are some", "143:37", "fighters that do it just blows my mind", "143:39", "and the way he was talking in the", "143:40", "interview was like like he's you know", "143:41", "and the other thing the thing that", "143:45", "concerns me more is that he was talking", "143:46", "about how he was winning that that first", "143:48", "round you know he felt like he was", "143:49", "controlling the fight he was did a lot", "143:51", "of good things until DC caught him so if", "143:53", "he starts banking on that B and you know", "143:55", "just one of those punches that he got", "143:56", "caught with he might not you know give", "143:59", "DC the credit for you know opening that", "144:01", "vulnerability up yeah I think for sure", "144:03", "he must have heard all the different", "144:05", "people discuss tactics though it doesn't", "144:07", "make any sense to me that he insulates", "144:09", "himself that well and", "144:10", "surest coaches over its strong style", "144:12", "they've definitely oh they've watched it", "144:14", "yeah they understand what so maybe he", "144:17", "realized and his coaches and their", "144:18", "guidance of him during training and for", "144:21", "sure he knows the DC knocked around so", "144:23", "what he's gonna do is go in there and", "144:25", "fight like he's trying to get it back", "144:26", "the question is is he gonna be able to", "144:29", "use that long reach in that height and", "144:31", "that power on the outside and keep DC", "144:34", "the fuck away from him cuz he's got a", "144:35", "considerable height and reach advantage", "144:37", "can he stuff those takedowns", "144:39", "can he keep DC from getting on top of", "144:42", "him can you know yeah if he can do all", "144:43", "those things he can get very interesting", "144:45", "and if DC you know he's undefeated at", "144:49", "heavyweight man I mean I think that's", "144:51", "really where he shines you look at what", "144:53", "he did to Josh Barnett fucking throws", "144:54", "him through the air like a ragdoll when", "144:56", "he was in the Strikeforce Grand Prix did", "144:58", "he was a monster at heavyweight you know", "145:00", "and the wrestling is unparalleled yeah", "145:02", "so do we get Jones at heavyweight then I", "145:04", "hope so I do I really do", "145:07", "I think he wants to do it at light", "145:08", "heavyweight though I think he wants to", "145:10", "prove a point", "145:10", "what DC wants yeah yes lose that weight", "145:14", "again do they what I had heard was that", "145:16", "he wanted to fight at light heavyweight", "145:18", "if he fights John for a third time", "145:20", "that's what I had heard and I think I", "145:22", "might have heard it from him and he but", "145:26", "I would incur if I was in his camp let's", "145:28", "say fuck all this dieting bro what do", "145:30", "you know when you have a belly you fuck", "145:34", "people up you know and he doesn't worry", "145:35", "about food you doesn't worry about", "145:37", "cutting weight he and he's fast for a", "145:40", "heavyweight much like Andy Ruiz", "145:41", "you know I think there's a benefit in", "145:43", "that there's I mean obviously people", "145:47", "there's people that knew that Andy Ruiz", "145:49", "was a really talented boxer coming in", "145:52", "but there's other people that looked at", "145:53", "his body and dismissed him but when you", "145:55", "see the efficiency of those punches like", "145:57", "and the fact that he's able to uncork so", "146:00", "many punches in close whereas Anthony", "146:04", "Joshua with his giant arms his long", "146:05", "length gets a little bit smothered by", "146:07", "that closer distance closer distance and", "146:09", "Andy's just dropping bombs on him over", "146:12", "the top and big power to him to men and", "146:14", "yeah perfect perfect mechanics like so", "146:18", "fluid everything is just smooth and", "146:20", "fluid who fucking knows man maybe DC's", "146:23", "the best heavyweight of all time", "146:24", "yeah well I mean quite possibly and", "146:26", "there's something to be said for that", "146:27", "physique as well there's an efficiency", "146:29", "that comes with that you know like you", "146:30", "look at Anthony Joshua and ya mean he", "146:32", "looks like a physical specimen but the", "146:33", "drawbacks would be obvious over rounds", "146:36", "where is Antony no Andi Ruiz DC they can", "146:38", "just yeah they just keep flowing and", "146:40", "it's you know those punches are more", "146:41", "about the momentum you know you need a", "146:43", "certain amount of muscle mass to get the", "146:45", "movement started and then you maintain", "146:46", "it with good technique you know like an", "146:49", "additional amount of muscle was not", "146:51", "gonna make up for a heavier punch really", "146:53", "right and he's talked openly about being", "146:56", "far stronger in training as a", "146:58", "heavyweight than he was as a light", "146:59", "heavyweight he just felt better yeah I", "147:01", "think it's a sweet class I really do I", "147:03", "think is you know look he beat the", "147:07", "greatest of all time I mean the greatest", "147:09", "on paper of all time at least at least", "147:12", "on paper", "147:12", "I feel like performance wise there was", "147:14", "moments where Cain Velasquez was in his", "147:17", "prime where I said like that's the", "147:19", "motherfucker that to me I mean I know it", "147:21", "doesn't play out on paper because he was", "147:23", "injured multiple times of gang surgeries", "147:25", "but when he was in his prime man he was", "147:28", "terrifying", "147:29", "he just didn't stop he didn't stay he", "147:31", "had welterweight colby covington style", "147:34", "endurance as a fucking heavyweight yet", "147:36", "he didn't make any sense and he's", "147:37", "slightly bigger than DC everywhere is", "147:39", "until i reach him yeah i never attends", "147:41", "yeah yeah and you know and he could fuck", "147:43", "you up on the feet too may need to do", "147:45", "everything he was so efficient and", "147:47", "smooth and just relentless relentless", "147:50", "yeah no one more relentless than Cain", "147:52", "Velasquez in his prime for him it was", "147:54", "almost like his body couldn't handle the", "147:57", "strength of his brain like his mental", "148:00", "toughness was so incredible his buddy", "148:03", "just couldn't keep what was it his mind", "148:07", "just press forward go go go", "148:09", "you know his in his cardio was just", "148:11", "preposterous do you make sense yeah DC", "148:14", "looks in good shape for the open", "148:15", "workouts just yeah I think he's", "148:17", "expecting a harder fight this weekend", "148:19", "you know where we really got robbed that", "148:21", "we never saw phaidor versus Kane in", "148:23", "their prime man we were robbed we were", "148:26", "really robbed because who the fuck knows", "148:28", "more than fire that would who the fuck", "148:30", "knows maybe fader would have caught him", "148:31", "in an armbar who the fuck knows maybe", "148:33", "Kane would have beat the shit out of him", "148:35", "who the fuck knows we will never know", "148:37", "man we'll never know and now they're", "148:39", "both fighting but it's too late you know", "148:41", "it's like you won't be

"149:08", "wrestler Tony James cliff right now", "149:10", "screaming in his pants like yes this is", "149:13", "better than fighting so does that mean", "149:16", "that most of his injuries came from", "149:18", "training camp then a man who knows I", "149:20", "think a lot of them must have come from", "149:23", "fights too it's just the mind that he", "149:25", "had that that fucking

about it", "163:24", "is that you can be far more tactical and", "163:26", "the one thing that I enjoy about boxing", "163:28", "is the fact that you can you can", "163:30", "implement a narrative in the first round", "163:31", "that can play out in the later rounds", "163:33", "and you can you can allow it to breathe", "163:35", "a bit because you've got 12 segments", "163:37", "that are being

to start", "164:19", "faster you have to you know you have to", "164:20", "do your first two rounds in the dressing", "164:22", "room before you walk out what do you", "164:23", "think about Pettis

used it", "165:43", "against Tony Ferguson he used it against", "165:46", "michael Chiesa it's a right body kick to", "165:48", "a straight right and because Diaz is", "165:50", "southpaw and he leans

feel like Diaz", "165:58", "is there to be hit and I think he uses", "166:00", "that to his advantage because he kind of", "166:02", "Homer Simpson's people like you wear", "166:04", "yourself out hitting me and then I'll", "166:06", "start to push my my game on you but when", "166:08", "you think about him against talented", "166:10", "strikers like you brought up Michael", "166:11", "Johnson

"but then Nate came back and it was a", "167:05", "really close fight at the end we're", "167:07", "really close fight an excellent fight", "167:09", "but Connor McGregor is a fucking", "167:10",

it's like a", "168:24", "reed in the wind that's that's how he", "168:26", "was able to absorb those shots from", "168:28", "McGregor because as they were coming at", "168:29", "him he was already moving away and he", "168:31", "was able to ride the power and then", "168:32", "McGregor was overextending you know and", "168:35", "I mean there's no doubt is a durable", "168:36", "individual", "168:37", "I'm just saying that he leans on that", "168:38", "sometimes too much yeah it's also we've", "168:41", "seen Pettis now at 45 55 and now 70 it's", "168:48", "really wild to see and you go
