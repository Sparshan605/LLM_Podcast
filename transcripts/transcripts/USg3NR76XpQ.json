today and this is this", "173:56", "Flat Earth theory", "173:57", "no wonder you know it's no wonder", "173:59", "because the many of the prominent", "174:01", "intellectual types have become

know so I think you're right about", "175:04", "that but I also think there's something", "175:05", "else going on I think people are aware", "175:08", "of this chaos that we described earlier",
