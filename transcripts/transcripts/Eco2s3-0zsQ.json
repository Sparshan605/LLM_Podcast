in", "01:18", "are high-level military people like", "01:20", "yourself so when I hear someone like you", "01:23", "who has a story that defies logic or", "01:27", "defies conventional understanding

want to talk to so I was very", "02:18", "excited to have you in here so what year", "02:22", "was your incident and you have a very", "02:24", "very famous incident that's krob", "02:25", "corroborated by actual evidence which is", "02:28", "one of the rare ones what year was it", "02:30", "and where did it take place", "02:32", "so as 2004 November 14th of the it's", "02:37", "really if you draw San Diego to Ensenada", "02:40", "Mexico or about 60 miles off the coast", "02:42", "in between the two we're doing work ups", "02:44", "so when we get ready to deploy this was", "02:47", "for the 2005 deployment we were going at", "02:50", "sea for November and December of 2004 so", "02:53", "we had been out I'd just taken over the", "02:54", "squadron mid-october so I'd been the CEO", "02:56", "for a month so we go out and we're", "02:59", "putting the Battle Group pieces together", "03:01", "so it's not just the the Air Wing but we", "03:03", "were you know we're on the carrier we've", "03:05", "got the cruiser we've got all support", "03:07", "ships out there and we're gonna", "03:08", "integrate all the defenses and train as", "03:10", "one unit so the exercise we're going to", "03:13", "do is an air defense exercise where", "03:15", "there's good guys bad guys they're all", "03:17", "from internal from the Air Wing so two", "03:19", "bad guys today are gonna be the Marines", "03:21", "VM fat32 the Red Devils so they're gonna", "03:24", "launch and they're gonna go about", "03:25", "hundred miles south of the ship and", "03:27", "we're the good guys and it's we called a", "03:28", "2v2 so it's two of us against two of", "03:30", "them we're going to work with the USS", "03:32", "Princeton which is going to be the", "03:34", "controller and they're going to control", "03:36", "the blue forces and then the red guys", "03:38", "are going to give us a presentation that", "03:39", "you know they're going to try and", "03:40", "intercept so we can stop them from", "03:42", "getting up towards the carrier so that's", "03:43", "kind of the training set that we're all", "03:44", "good so the Marines take off first and", "03:47", "they start heading to the South now we", "03:49", "have no idea that for two weeks this is", "03:51", "the two weeks we've been at sea they've", "03:53", "been tracking these things coming out of", "03:54", "the sky and when I talked to the Prince", "03:56", "controller he's like up to about a dozen", "03:57", "of them they would come down from above", "03:59", "80,000 feet they drop down to about", "04:02", "20,000 feet and hang out and then it", "04:04", "goes straight back up after about three", "04:05", "or four hours so when you say they've", "04:07", "been tracking them who specifically this", "04:08", "is the USS the Princeton is tracking", "04:10", "them they saw him on the Nimitz radar", "04:12", "and the e2 could see them so because", "04:15", "they're out there you know that radar is", "04:16", "on all the time", "04:17", "and the spy-1 system on an Aegis Cruiser", "04:20", "is you know the state of ours probably", "04:21", "was one of the most sophisticated", "04:22", "systems in the world so typically when", "04:25", "something like this happens and", "04:27", "some unexplained phenomenon what do they", "04:29", "do in this case that you know if it was", "04:32", "if we were in a threat environment they", "04:34", "would tell us but they're off the coast", "04:35", "of San Diego it doesn't come to the air", "04:37", "wing so we have no idea that these", "04:38", "things are out there at all so they", "04:40", "observe these things and they never", "04:42", "bother telling any of you guys that's", "04:44", "correct so they just knew that these", "04:46", "things had been visiting this area but", "04:49", "they just allowed this training exercise", "04:50", "to take place anyway", "04:52", "yeah talking to him the previous for the", "04:54", "two weeks they would show up but it was", "04:56", "when we weren't flying", "04:57", "so the typical carrier schedule is you", "04:59", "know for us it was about noon to", "05:00", "midnight it's a 12-hour day there's", "05:03", "reasons for that you can go a lot longer", "05:04", "they can but for training we just do the", "05:06", "12-hour day thing and it's cyclic ops so", "05:09", "you got guys taking off and landing", "05:10", "periodically so we were on one of the", "05:12", "first goes you know it's you know noon", "05:15", "one o'clock somewhere on there and we", "05:16", "take off the Marines take off first and", "05:18", "my buddy cheeks who's the CEO of the", "05:20", "marine squadron was one he was leading", "05:22", "the red air they had when he launched", "05:24", "off the carrier first they called him up", "05:25", "and said hey what do you got on board", "05:26", "well the the small the original legacy", "05:28", "f-18s don't have as much gas as the", "05:30", "super hornets super hornets about thirty", "05:31", "percent bigger so they start talking to", "05:33", "him about fuel and based on how long", "05:35", "we're gonna be airborne and everything", "05:36", "else they go hey why don't you just go", "05:38", "ahead and proceed to your your cap point", "05:39", "and because we had just taken off and", "05:42", "that's when the controller had come up", "05:43", "and said hey yeah I forget our cost and", "05:45", "spread like dealers usually what we went", "05:47", "so it'd be like dealer one one this is", "05:50", "Princeton control what do you got you", "05:52", "know say your loadout kind of chuckled", "05:55", "he said I said I got a Kadim nine which", "05:57", "is a it's a basically of just a blue", "06:00", "metal tube with a seeker head for a name", "06:02", "9ir missile it's a training it doesn't", "06:04", "come off the airplane you can beat it", "06:05", "with a sledgehammer that's the only way", "06:06", "you're gonna get it off or you got to", "06:07", "unlock the lugs with a key so I'm like", "06:10", "kind of chuckling because well hey we're", "06:11", "gonna cancel the training so we're like", "06:13", "okay he says we got real-world vector", "06:16", "and they're gonna send us out to the", "06:17", "west so picture if it's you know if you", "06:21", "got a clock the Nimitz is in the middle", "06:23", "we're a little bit south of that about", "06:25", "forty miles south and then the Marines", "06:27", "are about a hundred miles south of the", "06:28", "ship about sixty miles between the two", "06:30", "of us so as this is all happened in my", "06:33", "wingman is joining up all right and", "06:35", "these are f-18s so there's two people in", "06:36", "each jet so it's me and my WIZO which is", "06:39", "weapon systems operator and i've got", "06:40", "the other pilot and the weapon systems", "06:42", "operator any other jet so they tell us", "06:44", "all this hey we're gonna real world", "06:46", "vector and they send us out to seven", "06:47", "zero about sixty miles away from where", "06:49", "we're going so now we're going out even", "06:50", "further out to sea we have no idea what", "06:53", "we're intercepting and this is when the", "06:54", "controller starts talking to us he says", "06:56", "hey sir we've seen these objects they've", "06:59", "been for two weeks they've been coming", "07:01", "down and he's given us the whole story", "07:02", "says we need you to go investigate we", "07:04", "want to know what these are but they're", "07:06", "asking you to investigate in a jet", "07:08", "that's unarmed that's correct okay yeah", "07:10", "we have no there's reasons for that that", "07:12", "we don't fly we typically don't fly with", "07:14", "live ordnance unless we're actually", "07:15", "going into like a combat zone or we're", "07:18", "on a training range and we're gonna", "07:19", "shoot something and the reason is you", "07:20", "can go through history of the Navy or", "07:22", "Air Force if you put live missiles on", "07:24", "airplanes and then you start doing", "07:26", "training where you're squeezing the", "07:27", "trigger someone always messes the switch", "07:28", "ology up and someone gets shot down it's", "07:30", "happened multiple times so we don't do", "07:33", "it you know there's times that we do but", "07:35", "it's rare so we start flying out to the", "07:38", "west now I want you to think because the", "07:39", "other pilot has a you know when you talk", "07:41", "to it's good south it was a female when", "07:44", "you talk to her it's she hears the kind", "07:47", "of goes through the mindset of hey we're", "07:50", "off the coast of Mexico real world", "07:52", "vector we have no idea we're going to", "07:53", "look at probably drug runner cuz you get", "07:56", "the drum runners coming up the coast so", "07:58", "we're like okay so we drive out and", "08:00", "they're calling down ranges so they're", "08:02", "telling us hey it's two-seven-zero at 30", "08:04", "miles at 20,000 feet and then it's you", "08:07", "know you just count down the ranges and", "08:08", "we're talking back and forth the whole", "08:09", "time so they got to a point where they", "08:12", "say hey merge plot which means radars", "08:16", "have resolution cells", "08:17", "you know range and asmath of what the", "08:19", "radar can actually see once you're", "08:20", "inside that box you can't tell the", "08:23", "difference between me and the object I'm", "08:26", "going in will just become one big blob", "08:28", "mmm so they call merge plot and so the", "08:31", "other jet is on my left-hand side and", "08:34", "we're gonna and I'm going to go to a", "08:35", "clock code to make it simple so the", "08:38", "object we're going to end up looking for", "08:39", "is then right in the middle of the clock", "08:40", "and we are at the six o'clock position", "08:42", "and my wingman is off to my left side so", "08:44", "it's she's further down with her widow", "08:47", "so as we're looking around we we look to", "08:50", "the right and there's a it was yesterday", "08:53", "there's a perfect", "08:54", "example out here that water is perfectly", "08:56", "calm no Whitecaps I mean it's literally", "08:58", "a perfect San Diego California day and", "09:02", "we see white water it's something like", "09:04", "if you see a seamount you know rock", "09:05", "underwater when you're standing on the", "09:06", "shore and the waves are breaking over", "09:08", "and you're like what is that it's", "09:09", "usually because there's a rock under the", "09:10", "water so it looks like that but it's", "09:12", "about the size of a 737 it actually kind", "09:15", "of has a shape of like a cross and it's", "09:17", "pointing to the east so you've got the", "09:18", "long part going east-west and you got a", "09:20", "couple of things going north and south", "09:22", "so as we're looking at it cuz that kind", "09:24", "of draws our eyes we're like oh that's", "09:25", "kind of odd we look down and whiz oh and", "09:28", "the other airplane comes up and says hey", "09:30", "skipper do you and that's about what he", "09:33", "gets out of his mouth and I'm kind of", "09:34", "looking at the same thing I go dude you", "09:36", "see that what is that thing and what we", "09:38", "see is this white tic-tac looking object", "09:40", "just above the surface of the water", "09:43", "pointing north-south and it's going", "09:45", "north south east west it's just", "09:46", "radically moving forward back left right", "09:48", "at will and it's moving around the", "09:51", "disturbance the white water that we see", "09:53", "how big is this thing over time it's", "09:56", "about 40 feet long and the way I asked", "09:58", "to mate that is I mean I got a lot of", "09:59", "time fighting other airplanes so it's", "10:00", "about lot size of a Hornet fuselage so", "10:02", "that's why you say forty feet this", "10:04", "thing's just going left so the first", "10:05", "thing you see when you look down you go", "10:07", "and this is with our eyes it's not", "10:09", "sensors right so we're looking down at", "10:11", "this thing and first thing you think is", "10:12", "helicopter right there are the", "10:14", "helicopters typically stay below 200", "10:16", "feet when we're out there and they're", "10:17", "just driving around we're pretty far", "10:18", "away from the ship for a helicopter for", "10:20", "one of ours so what is it so the first", "10:22", "thing you look for is rotor wash you", "10:23", "know if you've watched any TV show that", "10:25", "starts kicking the water up and you can", "10:26", "see that it's really easy to see from", "10:28", "the air so we're like no rotor wash", "10:30", "matter of fact don't see any rotors", "10:33", "don't see any tail rotor don't see any", "10:35", "you know the main rotors or like that's", "10:37", "kind of weird so as we're driving around", "10:39", "we're looking at this thing we get to", "10:41", "about the nine o'clock position how far", "10:43", "away are you from this thing I'm at", "10:44", "20,000 feet and it's right down on the", "10:45", "surface - right off our right side so", "10:47", "I'm probably maybe a couple miles", "10:49", "lateral and 20,000 feet and we're just", "10:52", "watching it move around and so it's very", "10:54", "small in your eyes um not overly smarmy", "10:57", "and airplane down that low it's 40 feet", "11:00", "it was pretty clear so I'm like okay so", "11:04", "I said I'm gonna go check it out that's", "11:06", "what we're trained to do the other pilot", "11:07", "says hey I'm the", "11:08", "stay up here and I'm like that's perfect", "11:10", "so now we'll get some separation we'll", "11:12", "get it from different views and the", "11:13", "other airplane will act kind of a God's", "11:15", "eye view everything that's going on as I", "11:16", "go down and check this thing out", "11:17", "so I start driving around and it's still", "11:19", "doing its Ford back left right it's", "11:21", "still pointing north south we get to", "11:24", "about the 12 o'clock position I'm just", "11:25", "in a nice easy descent a reason you know", "11:27", "because I've been asked how can you go", "11:28", "more aggressive you can but when you're", "11:31", "out over water the water looks the same", "11:32", "at 20,000 feet it does it 2,000 feet you", "11:35", "don't you know yeah so you can easily", "11:37", "put yourself in a non recoverable", "11:38", "position if you're not paying attention", "11:40", "and you go into the water so I got this", "11:42", "nice you just send I get to about 12", "11:44", "o'clock and as I'm coming down you know", "11:45", "I could guess probably about you know", "11:48", "18,000 feet now a couple thousand feet", "11:50", "below the other airplane the tic-tac", "11:52", "just kind of rapidly goes and turns so", "11:55", "now it's kind of point east-west and now", "11:56", "it mirrors us so it's above the surface", "11:59", "or up high we're coming down it starts", "12:01", "coming up well this is getting", "12:03", "interesting", "12:04", "so we kind of drive all the way around a", "12:06", "circle I'm descending it's coming up and", "12:08", "I get over to about the eight o'clock", "12:09", "position of the on a clock and it's over", "12:12", "at about the two o'clock position", "12:13", "well the quickest way as we know as kids", "12:15", "to get someone you know you can keep", "12:17", "going around the circle nothing's going", "12:18", "to happen you cut across the circle some", "12:21", "about I don't know pry two to three", "12:23", "thousand feet above it and I just kind", "12:25", "of drop my nose aggressively and I cut", "12:26", "across the circle and it's coming this", "12:28", "way because I'm trying to fly to where", "12:30", "it's gonna be because I want to join on", "12:32", "it I want to see how close I can get to", "12:33", "right and as I'm pulling up it's kind of", "12:36", "starting to cross my nose and it starts", "12:38", "to accelerate and within about less than", "12:40", "a second as I start to pull nose onto it", "12:43", "and it crosses right in front of me it", "12:44", "just goes poof and it's gone so I call", "12:47", "the other airplane I said hey you guys", "12:50", "you guys see that thing and they're like", "12:51", "sure it's gone we don't see it at all so", "12:55", "I'm like okay that's kind of weird so we", "12:58", "don't see it we're looking at the same", "13:00", "time I say hey let's turn around and", "13:02", "let's go back to see what was in the", "13:03", "water you know there's was there", "13:05", "something there so we turn around right", "13:06", "there we haven't gone anywhere it's gone", "13:09", "waters perfectly there's no white water", "13:11", "nothing it's just blue like okay so we", "13:15", "turned back around now we're heading", "13:16", "back out towards the east and I tell the", "13:18", "controller I said well I said you know", "13:21", "first said I'm kind of weirded out and I", "13:24", "told my my backseater that we start", "13:26", "heading back and the controller on the", "13:28", "Princeton comes at me says sir you're", "13:30", "not going to believe this but that thing", "13:31", "is back at your cat point that was our", "13:32", "original point where we were gonna hold", "13:34", "40 miles south of the ship so this thing", "13:36", "is went from wherever we were at - it's", "13:39", "kind of about 60 miles in you know maybe", "13:43", "30 40 seconds it's already over there", "13:44", "and it just and they didn't track it it", "13:47", "just appeared he just shows back up on", "13:49", "their radar and they go it's here so", "13:51", "we're like okay so we fly back we don't", "13:55", "see it we don't see it on our radar we", "13:57", "don't see it on any of our sensors we do", "13:59", "like two runs and we come back to the", "14:01", "ship and land so as we're in our it's we", "14:04", "call it the PR shop we're taking off our", "14:05", "flight gear one of my crews is getting", "14:07", "ready to go out and I think they were", "14:08", "going to be on a tanker mission but they", "14:10", "had a targeting pod on board so they", "14:13", "launched off and we're tell him about", "14:15", "this before and I in the back seat er", "14:18", "Chad says he's really determined he's", "14:21", "gonna find this thing so he tells the", "14:23", "pilot hey we're gonna find this thing so", "14:25", "turns out driving around and in the back", "14:27", "seat of a Super Hornet", "14:28", "there's no stick but there's side stick", "14:30", "controllers and they're to control the", "14:33", "sensors because that's what the weapons", "14:34", "systems guys do and they can change", "14:36", "displays really fast by just hitting a", "14:38", "button and will flip

target all the other", "14:47", "sensors will look at that point so it's", "14:50", "everything's kind of synced together so", "14:52", "he picks up a hit on his radar and he", "14:54", "goes to lock it up because I watched all", "14:56", "the tapes he goes to lock it up and", "14:58", "immediately the radar can tell it gets", "15:00", "signals back that it's being jammed so", "15:03", "and technically jamming is an act of war", "15:05", "it starts jamming the radar goes into a", "15:07", "jam extrapolate a bunch of stuff happens", "15:09", "on the scope well he's smart enough to",

real", "15:18", "quiet so he does that and he and he goes", "15:21", "through if you watch the video if we had", "15:23", "and I'd go through it with you but they", "15:24", "go through all the different modes so he", "15:26", "goes it's an IR and an EO EO as TV it's", "15:28", "black and white TV camera we do we can", "15:30", "get the video right online yes let's get", "15:33", "the video Jimmy where would you", "15:36", "can't show it to anybody we can't we", "15:38", "can't show it on YouTube but you can see", "15:40", "it and people will be able to go to it", "15:43", "you know what we'll do", "15:44", "go to the video and we'll tell people", "15:46", "when we're starting and we'll tell", "15:48", "people with the title of the video that", "15:49", "you get to is and they can

yes we should be able", "16:08", "to but sometimes those things get messy", "16:10", "so let's take a genius okay let's take a", "16:12", "chance with this one I know if you go if", "16:14", "you're on a New York Times article", "16:15", "there's a link to it it's had it gone", "16:17", "really YouTube is crazy with copyright", "16:20", "stuff and we've always been like two", "16:22", "steps away

but", "19:55", "they didn't have all the details cuz", "19:56", "there's just one of those things we just", "19:57", "didn't I just didn't get into is it", "19:59", "classified", "20:00", "no was it at any point in time no", "20:02", "a lot of rumors out there that I was", "20:04", "classified and the ship got locked down", "20:06", "no it wasn't it was we were never men in", "20:10", "suits did not show up no one told us not", "20:13", "to talk about it and this is because", "20:14", "there's a lot of other people saying", "20:16", "other things and I said this look at it", "20:18", "that here's the context so in the battle", "20:20", "group you've got the Admiral", "20:23", "you got the captain of the ship the", "20:24", "captain of the Princeton and then you've", "20:26", "got the

"20:55", "there's a report that that George Knapp", "20:58", "got released it's a I call it the", "20:59", "unofficial official report and I had met", "21:03", "someone and I'm like hey can you find", "21:06", "any I had this incident normally you", "21:08", "tell people this they look at you like", "21:10", "dude what are you smoking I'm like no no", "21:13", "I'm good I'm tested and they go and and", "21:17", "they said well let me see what I can do", "21:19", "and I had got a call I was working I was", "21:22", "doing some aerospace work and I had", "21:24", "gotten a call my cell phone from a guy", "21:25", "and he said hey I want to investigate", "21:29", "your incident and I go okay so he did he", "21:33", "investigated the incident and it was", "21:35", "very very thorough I mean if you've read", "21:37", "that it's about 10 pages long and he", "21:39", "yeah I mean he tracked down everybody he", "21:41", "tracked down all the people that were", "21:42", "the aircrew that were involved he talked", "21:44", "to he tracked down the Admiral he talked", "21:47", "you mean he it was a pretty thorough", "21:48", "report and I don't think anything of it", "21:50", "you know because you know the the people", "21:53", "who weren't it's out there so they want", "21:54", "to do FOIA but it was never released in", "21:55", "a FOIA request I actually had the Navy", "21:57", "call me I'd been out of the Navy for", "21:59", "like six years and what's explain to", "22:01", "people that means freedom moved", "22:02", "infrequently so I got called by a public", "22:06", "affairs person from the Navy and said", "22:08", "hey is this commander forever I said", "22:10", "yeah they said hey do you know of any", "22:12", "documentation on your UFO incident off", "22:15", "the Nimitz", "22:16", "and I said official and she said yeah I", "22:19", "said no because I knew the rapport", "22:21", "existed but to me it was an unofficial", "22:22", "because I didn't know who were when I", "22:24", "and I had a copy of it but because it", "22:27", "wasn't official well then years later I", "22:29", "find out that the guy who actually did", "22:30", "the report was part of the a tip team", "22:32", "and I was talking to Lou Elizondo who", "22:34", "runs that program and Lou showed me the", "22:36", "documentation of the original I think is", "22:38", "like 13 people that were part of a tip", "22:39", "and they were fully exempt and I'm like", "22:41", "well that's kind of well hey I know that", "22:43", "guy he's a guy that did the report which", "22:45", "is why it never ever came out no George", "22:49", "got his hands on how does something", "22:50", "Freedom of Information Act exempt", "22:53", "obviously DoD has the ability because", "22:56", "I'm a I'm not a conspiracy theory person", "22:59", "at all I mean I'll just tell you that", "23:00", "you know I think there's reasons that", "23:02", "the government doesn't tell the public", "23:03", "everything and I don't speak for the", "23:05", "government but I think there's a good", "23:06", "reason for that that not everything", "23:08", "needs to go out to the public but most", "23:10", "of it does and they just what they do is", "23:12", "I put a clause on hey for this program", "23:13", "or whatever we're doing which would been", "23:15", "an a-type program the work that they do", "23:17", "and what they find is not it's not", "23:19", "releasable through Freedom of", "23:20", "Information Act there's probably other", "23:21", "avenues to get that you know and then", "23:23", "you go well what really is freedom", "23:24", "information because I got into this", "23:25", "sauna I was talking to someone who's a", "23:27", "conspiracy theorist and they said well", "23:28", "so and so wrote and they're not getting", "23:30", "any information on your event I said so", "23:32", "what are they gonna do they're gonna", "23:33", "call up you're gonna put in your request", "23:34", "for for freedom information you go", "23:36", "here's what I want it goes to some poor", "23:38", "guy at the Pentagon who's like I have no", "23:40", "idea what this is and he searches around", "23:41", "he doesn't find anything he looks at his", "23:43", "bud and I gain all for you I go hey Joe", "23:44", "you got anything on the Nimitz incident", "23:45", "you go oh I go okay well I didn't find", "23:48", "anything I looked I did my due diligence", "23:51", "but I'm not gonna spend the next six", "23:52", "months of my life doing your research", "23:54", "project for you right so you get nothing", "23:56", "and then you assume the government's", "23:57", "covering up when they go that really", "23:58", "isn't they just you know the guys are", "23:59", "doing the research doesn't know where", "24:01", "it's had or nice access to it makes", "24:02", "sense um Jamie we have the video okay", "24:06", "here we go", "24:07", "now explain what what is what are we", "24:09", "seeing why we seeing it in this this", "24:11", "particular cat the don't", "24:16", "on the top left corner na R is narrow", "24:19", "field of view which is zoomed in IR at", "24:24", "the top middle it means it's an infrared", "24:25", "mode so instead of seeing color you're", "24:28", "seeing temperature variations", "24:29", "and these things are extremely sensitive", "24:31", "to in like tents of degrees they will", "24:33", "tell you the difference so it'll go from", "24:35", "black to white so in this case white is", "24:37", "hot so if you look down on the bottom", "24:39", "left corner it says WH T mm that's white", "24:43", "it means white is hot so the object that", "24:44", "you're looking at is hotter than the sky", "24:46", "around it but we also notice is there's", "24:48", "no plumes not if you're looking at an", "24:50", "airplane when you get closer you'll", "24:51", "actually see the exhaust coming out and", "24:53", "there will be a really glowing plume", "24:54", "that's important as we look at the video", "24:55", "and then most of the stuff on here you", "24:58", "really don't need to know what you can", "24:59", "look at is the bottom right corner it", "25:01", "says $19,990 tude and if you look up in", "25:06", "the little words or it says HD G and", "25:08", "then B alt B it's autopilot so it's on", "25:11", "altitude hold it's just flying for that", "25:13", "so you can go ahead and play the video", "25:15", "and so those two bars next to the white", "25:20", "object that's a that's a that's a", "25:21", "passive track so what he's done is he's", "25:24", "commanded the FLIR to track that so what", "25:26", "the system does is it uses its actually", "25:28", "tracking it can track pixels and it's", "25:30", "just basically blocked those hot pixels", "25:32", "those white pixels from the black ones", "25:33", "and you're gonna see now pause it real", "25:36", "quick so it over the top see it went to", "25:38", "a white screen with the black object", "25:39", "this is a black and white TV mode and", "25:41", "even look at the top says TV so narrow", "25:44", "in TV mode is actually you can get", "25:46", "closer than narrow and IR it's literally", "25:48", "narrow in IR is about medium and TV mode", "25:51", "so there's you can get closer with the", "25:52", "TV mode so as you look at it now in this", "25:54", "case you would actually start to see", "25:57", "stuff going on and even in TV mode", "25:59", "because you get exhaust you know the", "26:00", "black exhaust that comes out he'll", "26:02", "usually be able to see kind of some of", "26:04", "that coming out the back and you don't", "26:05", "see anything this thing's just sitting", "26:06", "there and if you look at the the top", "26:08", "where it says three right that's the pot", "26:10", "is looking three degrees right on the", "26:11", "nose of the airplane right so he's just", "26:14", "flying along the bottom numbers don't", "26:15", "worry those are time so it's 41 56 so go", "26:19", "ahead and hit play and what what he's", "26:22", "doing is he's going Chad's going through", "26:24", "all the different modes cuz he's like oh", "26:26", "I got it and he's gonna try and see the", "26:27", "best video you can get now there's", "26:29", "rumors that this video is like 10", "26:31", "minutes long know what you're looking at", "26:32", "is the entire video now notice where it", "26:34", "says 99.9 mm-hmm so hit pause real quick", "26:36", "what that means is the why he's got the", "26:38", "pod the targeting pod because that's his", "26:40", "primary sensor right now the radar still", "26:42", "trying to look at this object", "26:43", "and trying to range it and the radar", "26:45", "can't get ranging on it so the object is", "26:48", "doing something to say I'm not giving", "26:50", "you back because it's just a Doppler", "26:51", "radar just like a police radar as a", "26:53", "Doppler it's trying to get arranging on", "26:55", "you and it can't do it so when it says", "26:56", "99.9 the radar cannot see this object", "26:59", "right now mmm it's not allowing it to", "27:01", "get ranging and I think that's super", "27:02", "important Dave the way he explained it", "27:04", "to me", "27:05", "active jamming compared to passive", "27:07", "jamming this is a technology that is", "27:09", "actively jamming this system rather than", "27:12", "something like stealth aircraft which is", "27:14", "the shape and texture of the yeah it's", "27:17", "because I one thinks stealth is", "27:19", "invisible it's not it's it's just it's a", "27:21", "technology to to basically make it", "27:24", "harder for radars to see you you know", "27:26", "and that's the whole thing you know if", "27:27", "you look at you know airplanes that are", "27:30", "knows on are harder to see than", "27:32", "airplanes at the sides kind of like", "27:33", "think of a barn door if you're looking", "27:36", "at the whole barn door it's really easy", "27:37", "see if I turn the barn door sideways", "27:38", "works really thin it's gonna be a lot", "27:40", "harder for you to see it guys so that's", "27:41", "it that's the easiest most basic way to", "27:43", "look at this so keep going you can play", "27:45", "again", "27:45", "and you can look to the airplane is", "27:47", "still sitting at 20,000 feet it's doing", "27:49", "250 knots he's gonna go through", "27:51", "different modes and try and lock it and", "27:54", "it's just kind of sitting in all of a", "27:56", "sudden as the video goes on I think it's", "27:58", "a minute and a half long see it's going", "27:59", "to try and reacquire it Rhys enters the", "28:01", "pod so it's it's slowly drifting to the", "28:03", "left the the Hornet is still going the", "28:06", "same heading it's just kind of hanging", "28:08", "out and they're just filming this thing", "28:09", "and I when they get close it's gonna", "28:11", "zing off the left-hand side when you see", "28:14", "it on a full because it's you know you", "28:16", "think digital you'd be able to get a", "28:17", "one-for-one copy I'm like you know when", "28:19", "you copy your album to a cassette you", "28:20", "know you lose a little quality well you", "28:22", "still do in digital world and they're", "28:23", "off it goes to the left and that's", "28:25", "pretty fast to leave that field of view", "28:26", "on the when we have big monitors that we", "28:29", "look at these when they come back so", "28:30", "we're looking at the original tapes so", "28:31", "they the end of that again please Jamie", "28:34", "so when it's taking off how fat when", "28:37", "when it just sort of like leaves the", "28:39", "field of view and takes off to the left", "28:40", "how fast is that going I would say", "28:43", "pretty fast it's an estimate if we had", "28:45", "ranging you know you could obviously", "28:46", "view the triangle and go hey because we", "28:48", "know how big the field of view is but", "28:49", "for something to leave the field of view", "28:50", "that fast with the pod just staring is", "28:53", "pretty fast I mean it just it's like out", "28:55", "of here like nothing that", "28:57", "we have no because we can't I don't care", "29:00", "what airplane is so let's just use the", "29:02", "f-22 Raptor that's probably one of the", "29:04", "it's probably the best airplane in the", "29:05", "world right now performance wise it", "29:09", "can't take off like that especially if", "29:11", "it's a hover I mean you're talking", "29:13", "something that's just sitting in space", "29:14", "in the wind and then it just all of a", "29:16", "sudden accelerates airplanes don't work", "29:18", "that way and it's not leaving any", "29:19", "exhaust plume no notice there's none and", "29:21", "when you go back to geography n even in", "29:24", "the IR you don't yes here's IR zoomed in", "29:26", "and there's no you would see a plume if", "29:28", "that was an airplane", "29:28", "it's creepy how it takes off yeah with", "29:31", "active jamming it's intelligently", "29:33", "controlled there's no rotors there's no",

"29:45", "in our inventory and no other nation", "29:47", "does that's how it's understood by the", "29:49", "government now that that's say if the", "29:53", "fastest plane on earth was trying to do", "29:57", "that same maneuver this system would be", "29:59", "able to track it yeah well yeah we'd", "30:02", "stay with it", "30:03", "until it got to the limits of the pod", "30:05", "you know as far as looking to the left", "30:06", "but right and you know the radar would", "30:08", "see it I mean we get get close enough", "30:11", "you're gonna you know everything becomes", "30:13", "visible because you get burned through", "30:15", "with radar and how how radars actually", "30:17", "work this one is you know you tell me", "30:23", "but this was performance beyond I mean", "30:27", "it's like when we saw it disappear when", "30:29", "it flew in front of my nose I'm talking", "30:30", "something I'm within a half mile of it", "30:32", "looking at it and it gets in front of me", "30:34", "and just disappears", "30:35", "so take we'll just go to something that", "30:37", "everyone knows as fast let's just say", "30:39", "sr-71 that's doing Mach 3", "30:41", "you know the visibilities fifty miles so", "30:45", "even at 35 miles a minute I'm gonna be", "30:47", "able to see this thing turn into a", "30:48", "little dot as it goes off into the", "30:50", "horizon for a probably a minute the", "30:53", "thing that we saw disappeared in a", "30:55", "second just gone and that's from two", "30:57", "different angles remember the other", "30:58", "airplanes 8,000 feet above me because we", "31:00", "we get close to at about 12,000 feet so", "31:03", "the other airplanes above me looking", "31:04", "down and when it disappeared I said you", "31:06", "guys see it they said no it's gone they", "31:08", "just literally was poof", "31:10", "now when you came back and what do you", "31:15", "do with this information do you report", "31:18", "it do you talk to people about it", "31:20", "so the typical process any time we fly", "31:23", "everything gets debrie so because it was", "31:25", "a two-seat airplane usually the junior", "31:27", "person then the jet goes down so I was", "31:30", "the boss so I wasn't going down there so", "31:31", "we have a thing called Civic c VI C", "31:33", "which is the carrier Intel Center so", "31:36", "they go down we always take our tapes", "31:38", "because we record stuff when we're", "31:39", "fighting they take it down and it's", "31:41", "really to exercise the system when we're", "31:43", "in training so that when we actually get", "31:45", "over to in this case we are going over", "31:46", "to the Persian Gulf you know anything", "31:48", "that we do comes in and gets debriefing", "31:49", "then it all gets sent off that's how you", "31:50", "get the CNN video and all that so they", "31:54", "go down and a debrief and I have to tell", "31:55", "hey we we chase this object we don't", "31:57", "know what it is you know and of course", "32:00", "everyone now is gonna make jokes because", "32:02", "we know we're gonna catch shit because", "32:03", "that's how the Navy works you know and I", "32:05", "told him I said I remember telling the", "32:07", "guy in my back seat I said dude you know", "32:09", "we're gonna catch maximum shit for this", "32:11", "and he goes yes sir I'll show you the", "32:14", "comics I have him on my phone we do the", "32:16", "airplane comes out so we know it's gonna", "32:18", "come down so he goes any day debrief", "32:20", "this both crews going in and of course", "32:24", "everyone at Intel thinks this is", "32:25", "hilarious so the flight the you know", "32:29", "Chad comes in with his tapes you know", "32:30", "and when he lands and there's the thing", "32:33", "yeah vfa 41 ha ha guys see any UFOs out", "32:37", "there and he pulls out that tape and", "32:39", "drops it on the counter he goes yeah", "32:40", "it's on here so they're like oh shit so", "32:43", "they copy it they play it and there's a", "32:45", "big it looks like a rack system they put", "32:47", "the eight mil in it gets copied to a", "32:48", "hard drive and then they they archive it", "32:52", "so you go okay so I got this video and", "32:54", "then you know the ship spreads you know", "32:57", "if you have a room around the ship 5,000", "33:00", "people are gonna know about it within", "33:01", "probably thirty minutes I mean it", "33:03", "spreads that it's like a virus so the", "33:05", "whole ship now knows that we chased this", "33:07", "I guarantee the whole Princeton knew", "33:08", "this stuff was going on and it goes all", "33:10", "the way up the Admiral knows about it", "33:12", "the captain of the ship knew about it", "33:13", "and and then all the movies because we", "33:16", "have they play movies for us on the ship", "33:18", "and they run like a 12 hour loops of", "33:20", "course the movie selection is men and", "33:21", "black men and black", "33:22", "two signs Independence Day and and we", "33:28", "know we're gonna be on the airplane", "33:29", "comet because there's always a comic so", "33:30", "you do some stupid or like this then", "33:33", "you're gonna be on the comm I'll show", "33:34", "you the comics here a little bit oh", "33:35", "they're pretty funny but you know so", "33:39", "that went on for two days but you know", "33:41", "we're in the middle of work ups", "33:42", "I got a squadron to run so it's like you", "33:44", "know there was after about the first day", "33:45", "and a half early died down and then it", "33:48", "was there's always that closet people", "33:49", "that you don't think that it really like", "33:50", "UFO buffs and you know like we had one", "33:53", "on one like one of the Marines would", "33:54", "always come and eat sit down hey hey", "33:55", "skipper can I sit with you okay you want", "33:57", "to talk about the UFO he goes yeah I", "33:59", "just I can't get it out of my mind and", "34:01", "then we would just sit there and talk", "34:02", "about it you know and to me it was like", "34:04", "you know we're just saying you know my", "34:07", "entire now flying career is defined by", "34:09", "five minutes of chasing this white", "34:10", "tic-tac vice almost 4,000 hours you know", "34:14", "flying so now did you encounter anyone", "34:16", "else that had a similar experience I've", "34:20", "talked to the guys a couple of guys from", "34:21", "the East Coast event the gimbal video", "34:23", "mm-hmm", "34:24", "one of them I talked to you daily he's", "34:27", "pretty good friend of mine totally", "34:29", "different now keep in mind ours is 2004", "34:32", "the gimbal video is 2015", "34:36", "the funny part about the gimbal video", "34:38", "and the East Coast stuff that was going", "34:40", "on because that's off the vacate so off", "34:43", "the coast of the United States sir", "34:44", "they're called warning areas and all", "34:45", "they are is their if you look out of", "34:47", "aviation map they're these big areas", "34:49", "that are blocked off by blue and they", "34:51", "say like whiskey 291 or whiskey 243 and", "34:54", "is the gimbal video available in the", "34:56", "same way that that video is available", "34:57", "yes yeah okay so and I was talking to", "35:03", "him about it cuz I asked a buddy of mine", "35:05", "he was just retired he was the he led", "35:08", "two fighter wing on the East Coast night", "35:09", "called him up because we start finding", "35:10", "out that these things were so prevalent", "35:13", "out off the east coast the United States", "35:14", "and there's a couple of them so there's", "35:15", "the we're going to talk what they", "35:17", "started seeing originally was these", "35:19", "things and one of them almost hit the", "35:21", "airplane almost hit one of these things", "35:22", "but it looks like a cube inside of a", "35:25", "clear beach ball so they don't know if", "35:27", "it's actually like a surrounding or it's", "35:28", "you don't know if it's a force field and", "35:30", "you see kind of in the gimbal via video", "35:32", "it's got like an aura around it where", "35:33", "ours didn't I always laugh I go ours was", "35:36", "tic-tac these are not that means there's", "35:38", "different stuff out there that we don't", "35:39", "know but they had two airplanes flying", "35:42", "and we fly when we go out to to Train", "35:44", "we're usually we have a distance you", "35:46", "know we'll just say we're you know ma", "35:47", "mile apart as we're flying out so", "35:50", "they're flying out and they're you know", "35:52", "the airplanes are deployed we caught", "35:53", "combat spread and one of the airplanes", "35:55", "almost hits one these goes close down", "35:57", "like 50 feet down the side and almost", "35:59", "hits one of these floating cubes inside", "36:02", "of the beach ball and if someone goes", "36:04", "out like it's a it's a balloon it's not", "36:06", "a balloon I mean these things are", "36:07", "literally sitting still they're there no", "36:10", "effect from the winds so if you got 90", "36:12", "knots of wind and they talk about it", "36:13", "these things are just sitting there so", "36:16", "60 or 70 people at see it because the", "36:18", "radars the the newer radar in the super", "36:21", "hornets is extremely extremely capable", "36:23", "okay and at first when they started", "36:26", "seeing stuff they were like that's just", "36:28", "like maybe it's the radar just give me a", "36:29", "false target and that really doesn't", "36:31", "give false targets and then someone did", "36:34", "exactly what Chad did is they threw", "36:36", "their targeting flare out there and all", "36:37", "of a sudden you see a heat signature", "36:38", "there's a return there's obviously", "36:40", "something out where that blip is at what", "36:43", "is a targeting flare that's a we caught", "36:46", "the 80 flares it's an advanced targeting", "36:47", "flirts it's on the left side of the", "36:49", "airplane and it's launched it like a", "36:51", "flare no no it's a it's a FLIR", "36:52", "forward-looking infrared receiver so", "36:54", "it's when you see the bombs blowing up", "36:56", "on TV and it's that looks like a black", "36:57", "and white and you see it's like that's", "36:59", "the targeting pod okay it's got a laser", "37:01", "in it it's got an IR marker in it it's", "37:03", "it's a very capable system that syncs up", "37:05", "to this to the Hornet so everything kind", "37:08", "of marries oh so this is the go-fast now", "37:09", "this is go fast no it's the other one", "37:12", "it's the was like that what is that", "37:14", "that's called the go fast that looks", "37:16", "like a tic-tac and I was another one", "37:17", "taking off the East Coast but they", "37:19", "grabbed it and Mark that one it's going", "37:21", "it's screaming across the ocean at a", "37:22", "very high rate of speed and there's been", "37:24", "some debunkers that say well it's really", "37:25", "not going that fast it's just the way", "37:27", "the airplane is and how the mechanics of", "37:29", "the Potter work and when you talk to the", "37:31", "crew cuz it's actually I could ask my", "37:34", "bud I'm pretty sure it's the same back", "37:36", "cedar took both of these videos took the", "37:39", "go-fast video and took the gimbal video", "37:41", "and my buddy was on the flight with the", "37:44", "gimbal video but they these things that", "37:46", "I call my buddies I'm like hey how many", "37:48", "people are seeing these things I got", "37:49", "like", "37:50", "60 or 70 60 or 60 or 70 people had seen", "37:53", "these things on radar and I said well", "37:55", "what do you do and they said well we put", "37:56", "out a note AM which is a notice to", "37:58", "Airmen that just says hey these things", "38:00", "are out there so just be careful because", "38:02", "we don't want you to hit one yeah and", "38:05", "it's kind of like our shego because you", "38:08", "would ask you know who do you tell well", "38:09", "everyone knows well what do you do and I", "38:12", "said well because it was all white and", "38:13", "it didn't have any markings on it and it", "38:15", "didn't have any wings and it didn't have", "38:17", "any rotors and it was just outperformed", "38:19", "anything that we have yeah I think if I", "38:22", "would have painted China or Russia on", "38:23", "the side is this the gimbal video yes", "38:25", "okay so it's the same pod in the", "38:28", "beginning Jamie what we're looking at", "38:30", "and when the crew finds it now what", "38:33", "you're not seeing you're seeing it", "38:35", "targeting when you hear them start", "38:36", "talking when you listen to the video", "38:38", "you'll hear the guy go dude look they're", "38:41", "all over look at the SA page so we have", "38:43", "a situation awareness page and whatever", "38:45", "the radar is getting returns on it'll", "38:46", "show up it's kind of like our God's eye", "38:48", "view in the airplane so the pod can only", "38:51", "look at one thing so he designates that", "38:54", "as his primary target so that's where", "38:56", "the pod is there the radar still seeing", "38:58", "everything else so what they're actually", "39:00", "seeing this video is what you're when", "39:02", "you see that the object that he's", "39:03", "tracking when I was talking to one of", "39:06", "the other pods he said there's actually", "39:07", "when you see the radar video there's", "39:09", "like a it almost looks like a formation", "39:11", "in front of them like five smaller ones", "39:13", "that are moving in front of it and then", "39:15", "they turn so like a formation these", "39:17", "things turns and starts going the other", "39:18", "way and then again while they're filming", "39:20", "the gimbal video and that's kind of the", "39:22", "comms when you hear it dude holy cow", "39:23", "look they're all over this is unreported", "39:26", "new information that he's actually", "39:28", "saying right now everybody knows this", "39:30", "video this is the one that they say", "39:32", "turns like the Lazar craft like", "39:33", "belly-first", "39:34", "however what he's telling you right now", "39:37", "is something that is not public yet he's", "39:38", "telling you that there was a V formation", "39:40", "of other objects that the public has yet", "39:42", "to see you're not going to you're not", "39:44", "going to the radar tape but I'm not", "39:46", "gonna there were more objects", "39:48", "surrounding this is what he's telling", "39:49", "you right now which is fascinating", "39:50", "because the world doesn't know that yet", "39:52", "just so you know I mean that's brand-new", "39:55", "that's never been reported by a New York", "39:56", "Times anybody okay", "39:58", "so you go ahead play", "40:02", "so the cool thing with this is that you", "40:05", "know when he goes into so he's an IR IR", "40:07", "mode right now you're still seeing no", "40:09", "plume he's looking 47 so they're", "40:12", "actually turning into it so it's", "40:13", "starting to pull it back towards the", "40:14", "nose see how the number at the top is", "40:16", "decreasing and it's against the wind now", "40:19", "he's in TV mode and this thing's gonna", "40:21", "just start to run you can kind of see", "40:22", "it's got that aura around it mm-hmm he", "40:25", "said they were saying that the the ones", "40:27", "with the squares inside that looked like", "40:29", "the beach ball were the same and this", "40:31", "thing is just hanging out so it's on the", "40:34", "airplanes on the left-hand turn and it's", "40:36", "so now it's right in front yeah it's", "40:38", "it's just rotating no this is how Lazare", "40:41", "described you know Lazar described that", "40:48", "that these things would lay flat and", "40:52", "then when they would travel they would", "40:53", "turn up on their side mhm and that's", "40:56", "that's how they maneuvered so this is", "40:58", "very similar eerily similar to the", "41:02", "propulsion system that Lazar talked", "41:03", "about and that's why this video we're", "41:05", "seeing it very differently now", "41:07", "especially with what we know about Lazar", "41:10", "but the idea is that it would fly", "41:11", "belly-first in high-speed mode so if", "41:13", "they have these are gravity propel this", "41:16", "is something that's known within the", "41:17", "government they're trying to back", "41:18", "engineer they're trying to understand it", "41:20", "we know there's a program currently that", "41:22", "they said is is gone however it is", "41:24", "currently active to study this these", "41:27", "things will turn belly first the saucer", "41:30", "type looking ones and then that's the", "41:32", "high speed mode because they focus of", "41:34", "allegedly you know these gravity wave", "41:36", "amplifiers look this thing turns", "41:38", "mechanically there again no typical form", "41:43", "of propulsion as an expert is telling", "41:45", "you this is not a glitch this is seen by", "41:48", "multiple radars multiple people", "41:50", "commander freighter was so close to it", "41:51", "this is something that is not", "41:53", "aerodynamic and it could move in ways", "41:56", "and fashions when he's underplaying it", "41:57", "when we first talked the idea of this", "42:00", "thing going up up up up up up it's", "42:03", "instantaneous acceleration back and", "42:05", "forth there's no slowing down no turning", "42:06", "like a ping-pong ball he said to me our", "42:08", "first talk ping-pong ball in a in a", "42:10", "glass nothing moves like that with", "42:13", "traditional reactionary propulsion", "42:15", "somebody has technology that we don't", "42:18", "have in our inventory at all", "42:21", "so this is counter-intuitive the way it", "42:23", "goes from being aerodynamic to being uh", "42:26", "narrow dynamic when it goes sideways and", "42:28", "flies belly forward that's correct it's", "42:32", "well it's not it's you know if you talk", "42:34", "because I was just talking that guy the", "42:35", "other day and he said the the irony with", "42:38", "is these things would be out there for", "42:39", "hours we don't have you know a", "42:41", "high-performance airplane does not have", "42:43", "hours where the gas I mean you know", "42:45", "Hornets we if we don't have area we're", "42:46", "feeling you know and we're actually out", "42:48", "doing a mission and fighting and going", "42:50", "fast you know you're talking hour and a", "42:52", "half and you're coming back to land some", "42:55", "airplanes are even less you know based", "42:57", "on their size you know so if like an", "42:58", "f-16 doesn't have external fuel tanks it", "43:00", "doesn't have a lot of gas and the Soviet", "43:03", "airplanes are the same way the mig-29", "43:05", "does not have a lot of gas the su-27", "43:06", "sweet 30s because of weight because it's", "43:09", "weight performance size of the airplane", "43:12", "so you know even even our", "43:15", "intercontinental bombers like b2 they", "43:16", "still take off and they error or fuel", "43:18", "they keep topped off so they can get to", "43:20", "range that's how we extend things you", "43:23", "got something like this that's coming", "43:24", "down you know just think of the physics", "43:25", "so just you know I'll use my instant", "43:28", "because that's the one I really know the", "43:29", "best is you've got an object coming from", "43:31", "above eighty thousand feet so I'll just", "43:33", "tell you that eighty thousand it's", "43:34", "somewhere around seventy eighty thousand", "43:36", "feet is where you can actually start to", "43:37", "see the curvature of the earth you know", "43:39", "so that's considered space so they're", "43:41", "coming from above that they're coming", "43:43", "straight down they stop at around twenty", "43:46", "thousand feet they hang out for three", "43:48", "hours and then they go straight back up", "43:50", "so and I know you had a lot on the show", "43:53", "so SpaceX is really excited because they", "43:56", "can launch a rocket and then they can", "43:58", "have the booster come back to earth and", "43:59", "actually land on a pad very impressive", "44:02", "engineering feat next to this technology", "44:06", "that's like a Model T next to a Porsche", "44:09", "I mean it's like wow really that's it", "44:11", "you know and you got something that can", "44:13", "just at will and move around now take it", "44:15", "to the next level and I know this is", "44:17", "there's a lot of talk about this so", "44:18", "think is going to go into speculation", "44:19", "mode but when you take a shape like that", "44:20", "so just take the tic-tac shape which is", "44:22", "shaped like a submarine if you're if", "44:25", "you're using a propulsion that's non", "44:26", "reactive where you're just manipulating", "44:28", "the median that you're in", "44:29", "err whatever you can go into the water", "44:33", "so when you hear the all the reports of", "44:35", "hey we've seen these things since you", "44:37", "know World War two that would come out", "44:39", "of the water and fly if you have a", "44:41", "technology like this as long as the", "44:43", "object is sealed where you're not

that", "48:52", "from for over the last two years where", "48:54", "people just find my email", "48:56", "and send me stuff saying hey this", "48:57", "happened to me I saw this and and", "49:00",

it", "49:26", "the good spots were down in like al", "49:27", "central California there's a range that", "49:29", "there's some bombing ranges but people", "49:32", "go camping in the Superstition

"49:42", "so we even go out at night flying around", "49:44", "on goggles and you'd see a campfire and", "49:47", "you go up UFO time and then you get the", "49:51", "airplane going about 600 knots and then", "49:53", "you pull the power back to idle so you", "49:55", "can't hear it and you get zing in", "49:57", "towards the fire well you turn the", "49:59", "lights are all now because we're in", "50:00", "restricted area so we can do that and", "50:02", "there's lights on it that you can only", "50:04", "see if you're on night-vision goggles", "50:06", "so the other airplanes can see us but no", "50:08", "one else can see us you go zing and at", "50:10", "it and then right when you get to the", "50:12", "campfire you pull the airplane into the", "50:13", "vertical yes stroke the afterburners you", "50:15", "let them light off you count to three to", "50:17", "pull them off and then you just go away", "50:18", "instant UFO reporting I'm sitting out in", "50:22", "the desert

"campers yes", "50:32", "yes I did not the only one who did it", "50:35", "but like I said we have a sixth sense of", "50:37", "humor yes so so some things are", "50:40", "explainable because I guarantee there", "50:42", "were phone calls made on some of the", "50:43", "stuff that we did and I guarantee you're", "50:44", "not the only one who's ever done that I", "50:46", "know I'm not yeah I'm not that creative", "50:49", "but it's just you know you think about", "50:52", "it you go because people go I saw this", "50:54", "or I saw that because I've got stuff", "50:55", "like that and I go yeah I used to create", "50:56", "stuff like that just not toes do you are", "50:58", "you Jeremy I'm sure you're aware of this", "51:00", "the footage from the the Mexican Air", "51:01", "Force yeah yeah very aware that what do", "51:03", "you think about that well again it's", "51:05", "it's IR footage which is really", "51:07", "interesting they actually got the", "51:08", "cameras for", "51:08", "runners right so you you can see in the", "51:11", "infrared so it's beyond the observable", "51:13", "you know I I myself have not detailed", "51:18", "looked at the footage however FLIR", "51:19", "experts and people that work with NSA", "51:21", "have looked at it for me and they these", "51:23", "are not lights in the distance", "51:25", "these are craft very similar to what",

thought they tried to assist it right", "51:39", "here it's just a mexican air force", "51:40", "footage yeah so they tried to say these", "51:43", "were lights on like an oil rig out in", "51:45", "the water that's been diba you say was a", "51:48", "fire mm to the comcast video of the year", "51:53", "was the mexican air force tracking like", "51:55", "six so literally right after our", "51:56", "incident I come and we come back and I", "51:58", "think we were getting ready to go to", "51:59", "fallon and i'm i had comcast and that", "52:02", "the homepage comes up and there's this", "52:03", "video and i go holy cow that looks like", "52:05", "what we chased and it was like six of", "52:07", "these things and they were tracking them", "52:08", "in the same area two right off the coast", "52:09", "Ensenada and it's not as rare there's", "52:12", "now admitted and increased frequency the", "52:15", "pentagon spokeswoman finally went", "52:17", "off-script i was tracking the scripts", "52:19", "for the last two years of what pentagon", "52:20", "spokespeople say about commander favors", "52:22", "experience someone went off script last", "52:24", "week in the new york times and she", "52:25", "admitted there's an increased frequency", "52:27", "of near misses because of these a AVS", "52:30", "anomalous aerospace vehicles so it's", "52:33", "pretty astounding we're getting all", "52:34", "these kind of revelatory moments in", "52:36", "these little seeds that these are not", "52:38", "ours we don't have this even Elan", "52:40", "doesn't have this I mean this is a", "52:42", "propulsion system unlike anything we", "52:45", "have it's amazing it's gravity propelled", "52:48", "now that gimbal footage when it said", "52:50", "that there's a fleet of them how far", "52:53", "away are those guys where you're seeing", "52:55", "you don't see the individual objects you", "52:57", "only see a singular spot well the pod is", "53:01", "you know when you get pretty narrow it'd", "53:02", "be like you know if I put three people", "53:04", "around you I can look at you and not see", "53:05", "the other people so that's what the pod", "53:07", "is doing but the radar is seeing", "53:09", "everything because it's a it has a nice", "53:11", "array dharna which is an active", "53:12", "electronically scanned array so instead", "53:14", "of like the radars we had which did the", "53:16", "mechanical you know doing this like", "53:18", "old-school", "53:18", "this thing is just a panel that sits in", "53:20", "the front of the airplane and through", "53:21", "beam sharing", "53:22", "beam's shaping it can move and it can", "53:24", "look all over so we used to have what", "53:25", "was called trackball scans so we would", "53:27", "be able to track a target why we're", "53:28", "still scanning this thing has scan law", "53:30", "but it scans while tracks so it it", "53:33", "literally if it sees you if the radar", "53:35", "sees you it has basically a weapons", "53:37", "quality solution then it can do that on", "53:39", "multiple targets is that's how it that's", "53:41", "the same way that the spy radar the", "53:43", "aegis system works on the cruisers they", "53:45", "can track multiple targets and have", "53:47", "weapons quality on all these different", "53:48", "targets while it's still scanning a", "53:50", "volume so in that image you're seeing", "53:53", "one individual object but there's other", "53:54", "objects yes the radar is seeing the", "53:57", "object that the pod is looking at where", "53:58", "they're talking and when you hear the", "54:00", "video you hear the the pilot say dude", "54:03", "look at the sa page there's there's a", "54:04", "whole fleet of them so what they're", "54:06", "seeing is the the the pod is looking at", "54:09", "the main that's the bigger object at the", "54:10", "gimbal the thing that's rotating on the", "54:12", "screen and there's five smaller things", "54:14", "in front so this thing's just sitting", "54:15", "there and then they kind of he said they", "54:16", "turn around on this on the radar and", "54:18", "start going the other way while the pods", "54:20", "looking at this guy just kind of", "54:21", "rotating so like a mothership and", "54:23", "smaller aircraft could be something", "54:25", "along those lines is there video of", "54:27", "those smaller aircrafts are just the", "54:29", "venom of the one large the only thing", "54:30", "they have is that the targeting pod I", "54:33", "would highly doubt even if they had the", "54:34", "video that they're gonna release the", "54:36", "radar video because of classification", "54:37", "levels are you able to tell the story", "54:40", "you told me about what was underwater", "54:43", "with your your other buddy because is", "54:46", "that okay yeah yeah", "54:47", "so it remains you know people come out", "54:50", "of the woodwork when they figure out you", "54:51", "feni's because now they don't feel alone", "54:54", "so I was working I'd worked I still do", "54:57", "it but I was doing oil and gas at the", "54:59", "time on a contract and one of the guys", "55:01", "the story came out and he was a Navy", "55:03", "helicopter pilot and he comes in he", "55:06", "comes in he goes Dee can I talk to you", "55:08", "man I go what am I guess I gotta talk to", "55:10", "you I said what do you wanna talk to me", "55:12", "about he says dude you know your UFO he", "55:15", "said yeah he goes I had a similar", "55:16", "experience I said what's that he said he", "55:18", "was flying ch-53 s which is a big lift", "55:21", "heavy lift that the Marine Corps uses", "55:23", "and the Navy uses it for certain things", "55:24", "and when they go off of for the East", "55:27", "Coast they do a lot of shooting off of", "55:28", "at the time it was off of Puerto Rico we", "55:30", "had Roosevelt roads that they ended up", "55:31", "close and", "55:32", "but he was flying out of there and you", "55:35", "know you got super clear Caribbean water", "55:37", "and they have these things called beak", "55:39", "um as they fly around and when they're", "55:40", "all done because they'll fly towards the", "55:42", "ships and the ship can sorry about that", "55:44", "they can track with the radar and then", "55:46", "they also do in a like the ships or", "55:48", "submarines shoot torpedoes there they're", "55:50", "called telemetry rounds so they have", "55:52", "they gather all the data on what the", "55:53", "torpedo or is doing underwater and then", "55:55", "they blow ballast and this thing will", "55:57", "come to the surface and float and then", "55:58", "they go pick them up and then they can", "55:59", "extract all the data out of them so they", "56:02", "do it for both so he said the first time", "56:04", "they're out and they're gonna pick up", "56:04", "his beak um and those things when", "56:07", "they're flying they're done a parachute", "56:08", "comes out and they gotta go they hook it", "56:09", "up the helo drops a swimmer in the water", "56:11", "he goes and hooks this whole thing up", "56:13", "then they hoist the whole thing up and", "56:14", "fly back and then they extract it in so", "56:16", "he says he's sitting in the front you", "56:18", "know in helicopters there's you know", "56:19", "c-53 you can actually see down by your", "56:21", "feet you know just like typical like you", "56:22", "got a Hawaiian ride so because you can", "56:24", "see when you're touching down so you got", "56:25", "really good visibility out of those", "56:27", "things and you can stick your head out", "56:28", "the window too because you're just gonna", "56:29", "hang it out he says he's going on there", "56:31", "and they're getting this thing hooked up", "56:32", "and as he's looking down you know cuz", "56:34", "they're I don't know what fifty feet", "56:36", "above the water he sees kind of this", "56:37", "dark mass coming up from the depths and", "56:39", "they starting to hoist the the diver up", "56:42", "and he's got they've gotten a beak um", "56:43", "and as they hoist it up he says and he's", "56:45", "looking at the single and what the hell", "56:46", "is that and then it just goes back down", "56:48", "underwater it's just like once they", "56:50", "pulled a kid in the beak um out of the", "56:52", "water this object descends back into the", "56:54", "deficit so he thinks well I was pretty", "56:57", "weird so he goes out he says not too", "56:59", "long later you know a few months later", "57:00", "he's out he's picking up a torpedo so he", "57:03", "says they got the they hooked the diver", "57:05", "up on the winch and they're lowering him", "57:07", "in and he's looking down he sees this", "57:08", "big massive because it's not a submarine", "57:10", "he's seen submarines before once you see", "57:11", "a submarine he can't confuse it with", "57:13", "something else this big object you know", "57:16", "kind of circular says it's coming up", "57:18", "from the depths and he starts screaming", "57:19", "to through the intercom system to tell", "57:22", "him to pull the diver up and the divers", "57:23", "like Fifi from the water so they've", "57:26", "reversed the winch and the divers", "57:27", "thinkin what the hell's going on and", "57:28", "he's getting pulled up and all of a", "57:30", "sudden he said the torpedo just got", "57:33", "sucked down underwater and the object", "57:35", "just descended back down into the depths", "57:37", "and they never occurred that that", "57:39", "torpedoes Jesus and this happened in the", "57:41", "late 90s late mid to late 90s thank you", "57:46", "I can pray get in touch with him and ask", "57:47", "him and he told me this story and I'm", "57:48", "like how do you report that you come in", "57:51", "and go well", "57:52", "where'd the torpedo go I just got sucked", "57:55", "down they just went down you know and", "57:56", "then you get to people that attribute it", "57:58", "as I something happened when it blew", "57:59", "ballasts and it just took on water and", "58:01", "sink and he's like it didn't sink he", "58:02", "goes it literally looked like it got", "58:04", "sucked down the only reason he didn't", "58:07", "they talked to him when they did the New", "58:09", "York Times stuff they talked to him but", "58:10", "it because the incident was from the 90s", "58:13", "they didn't want to they wanted", "58:14", "something you know newer mm-hmm so they", "58:16", "did not include it but I know they", "58:17", "talked to him about it now what was the", "58:19", "other footage that we were walking at", "58:20", "there was the first footage that Jamie", "58:21", "pulled up there wasn't a gimbal footage", "58:23", "go fast go fast what is that that's a it", "58:26", "actually looks more like a tic-tac but", "58:28", "it's they saw it going across the water", "58:31", "and they're they're just grabbing a lock", "58:33", "so they're seeing this with their eyes", "58:35", "and he gets the FLIR to lock out and", "58:36", "that's when you hear the kid go I got it", "58:38", "cuz he gets the AutoTrack and it's just", "58:39", "something screaming across the surface", "58:41", "of the water so and this is in the same", "58:44", "area", "58:44", "this is East Coast yeah this is the same", "58:46", "time frame as the gimbal video so the", "58:48", "idea that these are birds or the idea", "58:51", "that this is a radar glitch or somebody", "58:52", "said pilot error like on a clear blue", "58:55", "day commander flavor has nerves I mean", "58:56", "that kind of thing that people have said", "58:58", "on your show to you that you know this", "59:00", "these are explanations that make sense", "59:02", "who saw the I don't want to say that", "59:05", "West yes sure", "59:07", "Maina mint believes everything like", "59:09", "every single thing that's ever happened", "59:11", "has a rational explanation yeah it's so", "59:14", "that you know the probability that you", "59:16", "know all the radars went off at the", "59:17", "wrong time commander flavor you know had", "59:19", "nerves and all the other pilots up there", "59:21", "with him that you know this thing's shot", "59:22", "off like a like a can like a gun", "59:24", "instantly like that that was somehow", "59:26", "perfectly coordinated that's a", "59:28", "conspiracy that that's a fabrication", "59:30", "probably Occam's razor as the events", "59:33", "happen exactly like we're being told", "59:35", "yeah for us it was you know and I'll go", "59:38", "back to the beginning of the story of", "59:39", "you know the other pilot who was", "59:41", "brand-new yeah she had been in the", "59:43", "squadron for four months five months so", "59:48", "she's pretty junior she's still working", "59:49", "on her initial quality airplane and you", "59:52", "know so she gets the you know we get the", "59:53", "real world vector and it's like okay", "59:55", "real world vector cool I'm gonna get to", "59:56", "do something real exciting then you see", "59:58", "the", "59:59", "water and you think Oh something sinking", "60:02", "because it's kind of that shape of an", "60:03", "airplane you know that cross type so now", "60:06", "it's oh crap now it's search and rescue", "60:08", "we got to go down and see you know", "60:10", "because there's people you know and we", "60:11", "are sympathetic and to the tic-tac and", "60:15", "as soon as a tic-tac it's like I mean a", "60:17", "holy shit what is that you know and when", "60:19", "you get you know some people get very", "60:21", "emotional when you talk about it because", "60:24", "for me it was like yeah you know I you", "60:27", "know for her when you talk to her she", "60:31", "has a disdain for some of the leadership", "60:35", "that didn't tell us that these things", "60:36", "were out there you know they're here now", "60:38", "we're getting vectored because we were", "60:39", "the first time demand airplanes had been", "60:41", "airborne when one of these things showed", "60:42", "up that no one even gave us a brief that", "60:44", "hey we're seeing these objects out here", "60:45", "for the last two weeks they're just kind", "60:47", "of shit you might want to know they're", "60:48", "out there and they never told us", "60:50", "no one knew these things existed besides", "60:52", "the radar operators and the radar", "60:53", "operators didn't know what they were", "60:54", "they just knew they were seeing blips", "60:57", "you know so there's a lot of stuff that", "60:59", "you know that it flew around and it came", "61:02", "around me and it didn't do any of that", "61:04", "stuff it's the story that I gave you if", "61:07", "just relatively benign but it was you", "61:10", "know it's it's an interesting experience", "61:12", "so these incidents that they reported", "61:15", "were taking place before you saw your", "61:18", "that Tic Tac encounter yeah they they", "61:20", "were taking place over a period of how", "61:22", "many weeks two weeks we went out in the", "61:24", "beginning of the month for that's this", "61:26", "two-week ATS a period we pulled in for", "61:28", "Thanksgiving but other that we were out", "61:30", "till time December 21st is when we", "61:32", "pulled the ship back in besides pulling", "61:34", "in for three days at Thanksgiving so", "61:36", "yeah for the two weeks prior so this was", "61:38", "on the fourteenth and we went out at the", "61:39", "beginning of the month so about two", "61:40", "weeks they've been watching these things", "61:41", "come down go up come down go up but it", "61:44", "was always when we were not flying which", "61:46", "is really probably like the midnight", "61:47", "timeframe until early in the morning the", "61:49", "next you know till noon the next day and", "61:51", "then we just happen to go and if you", "61:53", "think about it you know I laugh it you", "61:55", "know if there was some little green man", "61:57", "flying around in that tic-tac he", "61:59", "probably got back to the mothership and", "62:00", "got yelled at for being seen like oh my", "62:04", "god you let him see you so so have you", "62:08", "communicated with anybody that has any", "62:12", "thoughts", "62:13", "why what these things are doing or the", "62:17", "the whether or not there's any", "62:18", "consistency to the size of them or", "62:20", "whether or not they think they're coming", "62:23", "out of a larger object or anything along", "62:25", "these lines no you know you can ask well", "62:29", "cuz I was asking you know what do you", "62:30", "think they were doing you know and I", "62:31", "said because you can look well they were", "62:33", "observing you know because they're", "62:36", "coming down and watching number two is", "62:38", "they were communicating because I think", "62:39", "you know in my heart I think there was", "62:41", "something under the water I don't you", "62:43", "know what it was doing there but because", "62:46", "of when you saw the X the cross looking", "62:49", "yep thing explained that again so the", "62:51", "disturbance may be in the shape of a", "62:53", "cross yeah like I described it as it's", "62:56", "about the size of a 737 so just think if", "62:58", "you submerge the 737 pointing it to the", "63:01", "east underwater by like you know 10 15", "63:05", "feet so as these waves are coming across", "63:06", "when they you know they hit that object", "63:08", "they're gonna break on top just like you", "63:10", "would with a submerge like a seamount so", "63:12", "and it's it's they're breaking and", "63:14", "that's where the tic-tac was that this", "63:15", "only reason we saw the tic-tac that's", "63:16", "what drew our eyes down there as we see", "63:18", "this whitewater when it's a perfectly", "63:20", "clear day with no Whitecaps and you go", "63:22", "oh what's that and then you see the", "63:23", "tic-tac and then we you know we do all", "63:25", "the chasing the tic-tac and we turn", "63:27", "we're right there", "63:27", "and we turn around and there's no white", "63:29", "water it's just blue as far as you can", "63:31", "see so at that point you go okay what", "63:36", "was it doing because there was obviously", "63:37", "something there that's not there now hmm", "63:41", "so that's where I say well it's it was", "63:42", "observing us it was could been", "63:44", "communicating with or whatever was there", "63:46", "you know and then someone else looked at", "63:48", "me and said you know I was talking to", "63:49", "Lou and he goes what about prepping the", "63:50", "battlefield I go okay you know so if you", "63:53", "go you know or these things from we", "63:55", "don't know you know are they from China", "63:56", "Russia someplace else I don't know but", "64:00", "it's a it's a capability that we do not", "64:04", "possess to my knowledge and if you asked", "64:07", "me in 2004 cuz there's a lot of guys go", "64:09", "out maybe it's some secret government", "64:10", "program I go alright well let's let's", "64:15", "let's be honest one if you have a", "64:17", "propulsion system that made it gave the", "64:19", "capabilities that we observed visually", "64:23", "that's a huge leap for mankind' period", "64:25", "so you would say yeah that was you know", "64:29", "think about its it's gonna be 15 years", "64:31", "next month", "64:32", "you know that we saw this I would like", "64:34", "to think that okay maybe let's just say", "64:36", "in 2004 it was something somebody had", "64:39", "this some government had this I don't", "64:41", "ours whatever", "64:42", "if you come to now you go 15 years later", "64:44", "you don't think that technology would", "64:45", "have emerged because it literally would", "64:47", "change everything we do I mean we're", "64:49", "happy about you know hybrid and electric", "64:50", "cars and all this other stuff but if", "64:53", "you've got something that works like", "64:54", "that air try would change our travel", "64:57", "forever", "64:57", "no visible percent system of propulsion", "65:01", "no what no plumes no it's just uh", "65:04", "yes we jokey and said that's a thing of", "65:06", "a 40-foot long tic-tac that can move at", "65:09", "will through the air at speeds well", "65:12", "beyond what we've ever witnessed I mean", "65:15", "even when you watch a rocket go off you", "65:17", "know one of Ilan's or one of the NASA", "65:19", "whatever you know you sit there and I", "65:21", "grew up during the Apollo ageism where", "65:23", "you just look at the thing go up up up", "65:25", "up up I've seen them shot out of", "65:26", "Vandenberg where you go you know I'd sit", "65:27", "in my house in central California and", "65:29", "you watch you go up and go I can watch", "65:30", "that thing for a while this is something", "65:32", "that just like poof a matter of seconds", "65:34", "is gone now our other pilots or other", "65:37", "people that have cited these things have", "65:39", "they also reported something larger", "65:41", "that's in the water near it no no not", "65:45", "the ones I've talked to I mean I think", "65:47", "you know you can get on History Channel", "65:49", "there's all this stuff on there about", "65:50", "people talking about stuff but you know", "65:52", "what here's the question is what do you", "65:54", "believe what you not believe and you", "65:55", "know my biggest frustration is the you", "65:59", "know our incident and even the folks on", "66:01", "the East Coast it is what it is to us", "66:03", "there's no reason to embellish there's", "66:05", "no reason to make stuff up but yet", "66:06", "there's still groups of people that are", "66:08", "making stuff up like someone came out on", "66:11", "ours was talking about and he's like I I", "66:13", "saw the whole the whole video is ten", "66:15", "minutes long and it was doing all this", "66:16", "it's bullshit what you see is that's", "66:19", "literally the entire video it's a minute", "66:21", "and a half long I think it's about a", "66:22", "minute and a half long what people", "66:24", "haven't seen that I saw I mean I've seen", "66:26", "the radar tapes because I had them as my", "66:27", "squadron you know I've heard you know", "66:30", "the men in black you know I just I'm", "66:33", "free you know maybe the okay I'll give", "66:35", "you the credit if they did but why", "66:36", "wouldn't they show", "66:36", "and talk to the guys who actually", "66:38", "witnessed it chased it and is one of the", "66:41", "senior guys in that group right it's", "66:42", "also possible that that men and black", "66:44", "stuff was something they used to do back", "66:46", "in the day and that that program was no", "66:48", "longer continued and you know from", "66:51", "Jeremy you would know this the older", "66:53", "sightings when they go back into the day", "66:55", "into historical sightings and I'm not", "66:58", "not Columbus but you know a 50s and 60s", "67:00", "did they have similar things that they", "67:02", "talked about or something moved in this", "67:04", "manner yeah it's absolutely incredible", "67:06", "and I want to dumb this down because", "67:08", "that's how I had to understand it when I", "67:09", "was talking with commander favor years", "67:11", "before I kept his secret years before", "67:14", "the New York Times blew it up I told him", "67:16", "it's probably gonna happen it wasn't by", "67:18", "me we were talking about it", "67:20", "this system that we have seen for over", "67:23", "70 years just documented by our military", "67:26", "this is so important this is a non", "67:29", "reactionary field propulsion system", "67:32", "everything we know is a reactionary", "67:35", "propulsion system you push something out", "67:36", "the back it goes forward this is not", "67:38", "like a mag system this is a", "67:41", "gravitational field propulsion system", "67:43", "and throughout history our military has", "67:46", "documented them and there has been", "67:47", "ridiculed now I'll tell you exactly why", "67:49", "1952 there was a huge flyover of", "67:52", "Washington DC jets were scrambled all", "67:55", "the papers covered it's very famous you", "67:57", "know case everybody can look up it's an", "67:59", "important case because at that time a", "68:02", "policy was started and that policy", "68:04", "started because it crashed our", "68:07", "communications that teletypes went down", "68:09", "the panic of the UFOs that were being", "68:12", "seen by people with fighter pilots", "68:14", "trying to capture and trying to engage", "68:16", "them and and it crashed the teletypes so", "68:19", "our government was like oh that's not", "68:21", "happening again because you know Russia", "68:22", "could use that as a scare tactic so this", "68:25", "policy of denial don't look here nothing", "68:28", "to see move on UFOs are fake", "68:30", "that's what Project Blue Book was tasked", "68:32", "to do specifically the guy who ran it", "68:35", "admitted that that it was tasked to", "68:38", "debunk this and demystify the UFO thing", "68:40", "that's J Allen Hynek correct right", "68:42", "I also yeah jr. Hynek um he was once", "68:45", "asked by a friend of mine do you have", "68:47", "the smoking gun I'll give you this", "68:49", "documents pretty amazed", "68:50", "it's an Air Force manual where they", "68:51", "explain what they know about UFOs at", "68:53", "that time in 1967 but here's the point", "68:56", "yes this has been going on since the", "68:58", "beginning of recorded human history", "69:00", "these propulsion systems that are", "69:03", "captured on footage you know that is", "69:06", "confirmed now by the net by the Pentagon", "69:08", "like commander flavors experience this", "69:11", "technology is not ours it's it was here", "69:14", "70 years ago you stole my 15 years ago", "69:16", "we didn't know we would see it now these", "69:19", "exact things at 20,000 miles an hour", "69:21", "going on 70 years ago documented", "69:23", "somebody has a non reactionary feel", "69:27", "propulsion system now are they aliens or", "69:30", "some subset of humans you know somebody", "69:33", "has them and they're fine", "69:34", "through our airspace with impunity and", "69:36", "pilots like commander favor who by the", "69:38", "way defended Los Angeles over not after", "69:41", "9/11 I mean this is a guy we put all of", "69:43", "our trust him he was defending Lausanne", "69:45", "just right after 9/11 so we got people", "69:47", "like him coming forward saying I saw", "69:49", "this and you got Internet warriors being", "69:51", "like it's a bird it's a glitch it's", "69:52", "Superman let's not concentrate on them", "69:54", "what about the Columbus thing did you", "69:56", "find that yeah it's just there's like", "69:58", "light 1492 light signature event that", "70:02", "they saw white in the distance because", "70:04", "it is the actual text no there's nothing", "70:08", "like Wikipedia stuff it's just one of", "70:11", "the oldest accounts I was trying to", "70:13", "throw out that this is something that do", "70:15", "you know of there's a very famous", "70:17", "painting that shows what appears to be", "70:20", "men in crafts flying through the sky in", "70:23", "the background of an ancient painting do", "70:27", "you know I'm talking about I do I", "70:28", "actually have a page one of the first", "70:30", "pages ever put on my website is like a", "70:32", "bunch of these because throughout", "70:34", "history there are these indications of", "70:37", "ships of crap but you know what the one", "70:40", "I'm talking about it's like and yes that", "70:43", "that's the shape of it it's also like a", "70:45", "plate turned on its side and then", "70:48", "there's a person inside of it yeah yeah", "70:50", "man it's it's flying through in that", "70:52", "same yeah that's it yeah", "70:54", "like look how it it's flying but you", "70:57", "know the thing is is it everybody can", "70:58", "say are the one above that's pretty cool", "71:00", "because that was a hidden thing I've", "71:02", "studied that one where it says", "71:03", "discovery fifteenth-century above the", "71:06", "her left shoulder there is an object and", "71:09", "if you really zoom in look at the dudes", "71:11", "staring up at it as a painter my wife is", "71:14", "a painter everything is intentional", "71:15", "which wears the ground of the ground", "71:17", "yeah right over there it's pretty cool", "71:18", "looking up so I think that's 15th", "71:20", "century it said so that the problem with", "71:22", "this Joe is it go to the original one", "71:23", "the one that we just looked at Jamie the", "71:25", "one right before that yeah so you get a", "71:27", "big picture yeah that is so strange like", "71:30", "here you got Christ being crucified and", "71:32", "then above him UFOs like is that", "71:37", "supposed to be aliens or is that", "71:40", "supposed to be angels like so what is", "71:41", "that supposed to be in these things that", "71:44", "they have it's severe it's real similar", "71:47", "to what we're talking about here that's", "71:49", "the argument of miracle of Fatima let's", "71:51", "say I mean again this is so speculative", "71:52", "we have a witness here of you know pilot", "71:54", "but when you see something like the", "71:56", "miracle of Fatima if you look at the", "71:58", "miracle of Fatima God that's that one", "72:00", "that was you know considered a real", "72:02", "miracle by the church and the three kids", "72:04", "we're getting messages I'll get this all", "72:06", "wrong but for like months that they're", "72:08", "going to be visited and to bring people", "72:09", "and bigger and bigger groups gathered to", "72:11", "where there was over a hundred thousand", "72:12", "people years of 1917 1917 so you know", "72:18", "dozens of thousands if not hundreds but", "72:21", "dozens for sure see an event a mass", "72:25", "sighting of something that happened", "72:27", "we're talking people that were religious", "72:29", "people that weren't religious you know", "72:30", "doctors that that's not a real image", "72:32", "there's a gym now one's doctored a", "72:33", "little bit so you could see what they're", "72:35", "all looking at something but that's not", "72:36", "real yeah that's the but that's the", "72:38", "crowd right the crowd is real is that", "72:41", "right so here's the thing people come", "72:44", "out something happened that was so", "72:45", "intense some people thought it was", "72:48", "religious that it was a visitation but", "72:50", "other people saw it as technological", "72:52", "like something descended you know look", "72:55", "into I'm just saying art pictures like", "72:57", "paintings we're talking about men you", "72:59", "can interpret them all day I can't hold", "73:01", "on to that I can't hold on to an", "73:03", "eyewitness with other eyewitnesses with", "73:06", "radar systems and with video we're in a", "73:09", "different era now we don't have to paint", "73:10", "it man we get to see it it's fascinating", "73:13", "man", "73:14", "it is fascinating but it's way more", "73:15", "faster", "73:16", "when someone like you talks about it", "73:18", "versus some fucking random kook you know", "73:22", "that's that's what makes me incredibly", "73:24", "interested is the just your credibility", "73:28", "in the fact that this is not you know", "73:30", "I'm a history of seeing wacky shit that", "73:32", "other people don't see no just this once", "73:34", "and but it's the on video and that", "73:36", "there's other ones as well this it's", "73:37", "really strange that I've seen people try", "73:39", "to explain it away and what I don't like", "73:41", "about when they explained it away or", "73:43", "attempt to explain it away is that", "73:45", "they're trying really hard they're not", "73:47", "going who knows what this fucking thing", "73:49", "is they're not looking at it like", "73:50", "cleanly they're looking at it like a", "73:53", "quote-unquote skeptic I don't like the", "73:56", "idea of being a skeptic not that I don't", "73:59", "think you should be skeptical of certain", "74:00", "things I certainly think you should be", "74:02", "but there's a lot of people that brand", "74:03", "themselves as skeptics and I think it's", "74:06", "a lazy way to look at things I really do", "74:08", "because I think you're just looking for", "74:11", "the holes in

at it they're trying to find a", "74:31", "way where they can justify that it's", "74:33", "fake and they're they're just doing all", "74:36", "sorts of mental gymnastics to try to", "74:38", "make it

out yeah well I think because", "74:49", "people confuse all the time like we took", "74:51", "the video no it was another crew that", "74:52", "took the video we we watched it for five", "74:54", "minutes with our eyeballs and there was", "74:56", "four of us and we all have the same", "74:58", "story we all saw the same stuff we all", "75:01", "came back and looked at each other and", "75:02", "scratched her head and said WTF you know", "75:04", "I mean serious what was that you know", "75:08", "and then what do you do you you move on", "75:11", "we never saw it again I imagine they", "75:15", "probably saw him on radar after that but", "75:16", "I think they're probably seeing them on", "75:18", "radar all the time they just don't bring", "75:20", "it to the attention of the general", "75:22", "public oh yeah because if you don't you", "75:24", "know for for a ship when they see", "75:25", "something and you know you know what is", "75:27", "that well you don't have any way to go", "75:28", "out there and look at it", "75:30", "like when you're talking about how they", "75:31", "were informing you that they were seeing", "75:33", "these things previous to your

ago there was other similar", "76:00", "situations or there's other situations", "76:02", "that have happened out there but yeah I", "76:04", "would say you know for this I I don't", "76:06", "even

"78:33", "high-level government officials is what", "78:36", "I'll say and most of that is because", "78:37", "that conversation is between me and them", "78:39", "and I don't want people speculating but", "78:41", "you can say high-level government", "78:43", "officials I have talked to well that was", "78:46", "always the the speculation about like", "78:49", "what would someone do if they became", "78:51", "president well the first thing I would", "78:53", "do is I would tell everybody about the", "78:55", "UFOs I would ask immediately what's", "78:58", "going on and I always thought about I", "79:00", "said how many people actually know", "79:01", "what's going on and how much of the", "79:03", "information I mean it's not like if", "79:05", "they're dealing with something like this", "79:07", "like your experience it seems like what", "79:11", "you described is what is known so it's", "79:16", "this anomalous event with this thing", "79:20", "defies our current

anybody have well I", "79:32", "would say I would say this because I've", "79:34", "talked to Bob we did a table czar yeah", "79:36", "we did an event together and I'll leave", "79:38", "it to everyone to if he it's up to you", "79:41", "to believe Bob I'll say this", "79:43", "Bob's a normal guy Bob's not crazy he's", "79:46", "not crazy at all not at all that was the", "79:47", "weirdest thing about talking to him but", "79:49", "when you when you look at it and go", "79:51", "because I had asked Bob I said what he", "79:54", "describes in the technology when he", "79:56", "talks about his", "79:56", "his story I said well do you honestly", "80:00", "think we could you know reverse engineer", "80:02", "it I said how long do you think it would", "80:04", "take us and his response to me was", "80:05", "another hundred years he goes Dave it", "80:08", "was so far beyond he goes the stuff that", "80:11", "he says he worked on he's like you know", "80:13", "there was on your podcast cuz I watched", "80:15", "it you know hey there was no wires and", "80:17", "because I had asked him when he said you", "80:19", "first described the ship that he got to", "80:21", "see he said I used to say you know they", "80:23", "built it and then it was like wax and", "80:24", "you'd heat it up he goes now I would say", "80:26", "it was built with 3d printing because", "80:27", "now a 3d printing we didn't know things", "80:29", "literally from the ground up and it's", "80:30", "basically built as one not panels no", "80:33", "rivets it's just made right and so when", "80:37", "you talk about that and you go well it's", "80:38", "still another 100 years so you go well", "80:40", "what if you had the technology we still", "80:42", "if if what Bob says is correct we still", "80:45", "don't understand it and how fast would", "80:48", "it take us to understand that", "80:49", "I mean if it's if it's driven by", "80:51", "something that we don't even have on", "80:52", "earth which is when he talks about that", "80:54", "element we can't create it you know we", "80:59", "can create it for a microsecond and then", "81:01", "it you know it decays and we call them", "81:03", "at 115 yeah so you know I think we're", "81:06", "we're still a long ways off you know", "81:08", "I'll argue with the people that go you", "81:11", "know are we really alone I was telling", "81:13", "Jeremy we used to go out on on goggles", "81:14", "you know out in the middle Pacific", "81:16", "there's no light poles night-vision", "81:18", "goggles so we can see well you go out at", "81:20", "night and he'd be on like a tanker", "81:21", "hopper so I'm just hanging out not doing", "81:23", "anything driving around in circles with", "81:25", "the autopilot on you just turn all the", "81:26", "lights down in the cockpit so you have", "81:27", "no night light pollution and you just", "81:28", "look roll your head back and look up", "81:30", "there's billions and billions and", "81:33", "billions of stars out there and you know", "81:35", "I always look up cuz I'm like you know", "81:38", "are we alone and I go I look up and go", "81:40", "well if we're the only ones around and", "81:43", "that's and I'm looking everything I'm", "81:44", "looking at some it's a pretty sad place", "81:46", "it's a pretty lonely universe I asked my", "81:48", "astrophysics prof that once I said you", "81:49", "believe in extraterrestrial life and", "81:51", "she's like of course not and I said well", "81:54", "there's billions and billions of planets", "81:55", "you think we're it I mean just the", "81:59", "probability of it is you'd go other Spri", "82:02", "something else out there and I'm not", "82:03", "crazy I'm just opening up the", "82:04", "possibility that we are not the only", "82:06", "planet that has life on it I think", "82:08", "people don't like to seems", "82:10", "silly they don't like to be foolish and", "82:13", "I think when people start talking about", "82:15", "anything that's not proven or anything", "82:17", "that's connected to a bunch of loony", "82:19", "people that are making up stories which", "82:20", "UFOs certainly are yes

country", "82:30", "Billy something or another Billy - yeah", "82:33", "seems a hundred percent full of shit", "82:35", "yeah yeah he's proven to have done tons", "82:37", "of hoaxes with this but here's the deal", "82:39", "sometimes I think people have a real", "82:41", "experience and they're always like", "82:43", "chasing that dragon and they get UFO", "82:45", "disease and the brain goes fucking", "82:46", "berserk right I know that there are", "82:48", "people that have had profound", "82:50", "experiences and then they can't ever", "82:52", "replicate them so then they just start", "82:53", "going crazy and I don't blame them for", "82:55", "it but you got some of that command of", "82:57", "flavor when he saw that AAV anomalous", "83:00", "aerospace vehicle his reaction was I", "83:03", "want to fly it that's a pretty cool", "83:05", "reaction I'd like to fly it yeah imagine", "83:07", "flying that thing well that's what I", "83:09", "told my buddy is my XO at the time Dell", "83:11", "got back after all this happened he", "83:13", "looks I mean we're just standing right", "83:15", "here when he goes hey dude I go it he", "83:17", "goes what do you think it is I go I have", "83:19", "no idea but it was pretty freakin", "83:21", "impressive and I'd like to fly it Corps", "83:23", "and he goes yeah I go I mean it was it", "83:25", "was you know it's just like any putt you", "83:28", "always want to follow coolest thing", "83:29", "worse yeah of course you race car driver", "83:31", "you want to drive the fastest car that's", "83:33", "it now you look at and go well that's", "83:35", "some we don't have yeah this idea that", "83:37", "you know maybe we're not alone that some", "83:39", "of these other stars have planets that", "83:41", "or maybe technologically advanced so the", "83:43", "next thing people say and you know new", "83:45", "eras are going to say well they're not", "83:47", "coming here because the distance is so", "83:48", "vast hold the fuck up from the very", "83:51", "beginning when Bob Lazar came for and", "83:53", "talked about field propulsion gravity", "83:55", "propulsion distance becomes completely", "83:58", "irrelevant so if we believe the and the", "84:00", "radars are right and commander framers", "84:02", "saw this thing moving like a ping-pong", "84:03", "ball in glass water it's gravity", "84:04",

warping time and space", "84:16", "you're falling into place", "84:17", "well it's like the idea of showing", "84:20", "someone a video on your phone long", "84:21", "before video was ever invented", "84:23", "people like what are you talking about", "84:25", "like before photography was invented", "84:27", "which is shockingly recent right you", "84:29", "ought to draw pictures of things you saw", "84:31", "just like those people that drew or", "84:33", "painted that those images of those men", "84:36", "and whatever those things were with", "84:38", "Christ in the background the idea that", "84:40", "we could understand what some insanely", "84:43", "impressive technology from a planet that", "84:45", "is nowhere near us could could manifest", "84:49", "that's great it's nuts", "84:51", "yes but Bob Lazar talks a lot about this", "84:53", "remember he's a young guy right in 1989", "84:55", "he gets shown something and all of a", "84:58", "sudden he's trying to interpret it", "85:00", "through 1989 technology so he said it", "85:02", "looks like it was injection molded", "85:04", "because that's what he had and then Ron", "85:05", "I said him this thing about", "85:06", "nanotechnology and you know working", "85:08", "towards an atomic printer he's like dude", "85:10", "that makes a lot more sense so he has to", "85:13", "view it through where he saw it in 1989", "85:15", "however I will say this it is my", "85:17", "knowledge that we understand exactly how", "85:19", "these crafts work our one limiting", "85:22", "factor is our material science we can't", "85:24", "replicate not the fuel source itself is", "85:27", "another when you say we know exactly how", "85:28", "they work yeah it doesn't break our laws", "85:30", "of physics this concept of amplification", "85:33", "of gravity this concept of gravity", "85:35", "propulsion we understand how things can", "85:38", "move from point A to point B almost", "85:40", "instantaneously our physics doesn't", "85:43", "disallow it but our material science and", "85:45", "the fuel to create that machine that we", "85:49", "we have machines from other places so we", "85:52", "I mean well Bob Lazar whether you", "85:55", "believe him or not that there was a", "85:57", "program I have other witnesses that I", "85:59", "will be bringing forward about s4 where", "86:02", "he worked", "86:02", "we have cred of other witnesses that", "86:04", "worked with along the people that", "86:06", "corroborate Bob's account in that they", "86:11", "saw him get on and off the red and", "86:13", "whites the Janet flights that come on", "86:14", "mm-hmm somebody that went to Papoose", "86:17", "Lake and was stopped by non-military", "86:19", "guards at that time people that were", "86:22", "aware of sight four and et exploitation", "86:26", "projects one is an sr-71 pilot that I've", "86:30", "been talking with for a couple years so", "86:31", "these people are coming for now which", "86:33", "and it's like I'm sick and tired of", "86:34", "doing it these little nitpicky things", "86:36", "about", "86:36", "Bob okay there was a program there was a", "86:40", "back engineering program they've", "86:42", "admitted there are materials so this is", "86:44", "like the meta materials you heard about", "86:45", "in the New York Times all that we have", "86:47", "materials associated with UFOs that are", "86:50", "interesting what is that what are you", "86:52", "talking about so this was something that", "86:54", "was launched in the first New York Times", "86:56", "article I believe in December of 2017", "86:57", "that there is studies being done right", "86:59", "now on materials associated with UFOs", "87:03", "right so actual metals that have come", "87:05", "off of you could say crashes or who is", "87:08", "that that explained that there was", "87:10", "something that they were with Eric", "87:11", "Weinstein that was explaining that there", "87:14", "was someone who reportedly has something", "87:17", "along those shocks ballet has 17 samples", "87:19", "17 samples how does one night at 17 Sam", "87:22", "well he's jock fucking ballet right so", "87:24", "he is the guy first ever for the United", "87:26", "States military created a computer", "87:28", "program for you know for the study of", "87:30", "UFOs for Project Blue Books he's an old", "87:32", "school guy they modeled him after in the", "87:34", "Close Encounters movie it's modeled", "87:36", "after Jacques Vallee the French guy so", "87:38", "he's kind of like been involved with", "87:39", "this he's had more access to government", "87:41", "databases than any of us he went around", "87:43", "collected samples from known you know", "87:46", "crashes or like when things will come", "87:49", "off and what's the conclusion well", "87:51", "they're studying him right now there was", "87:52", "just something on Fox about they're", "87:54", "studying some of these materials and", "87:56", "what they will find because I actually", "87:57", "the ones they're talking about I", "87:58", "actually took to New Mexico and had five", "88:00", "scientists study it about five years ago", "88:03", "I got my hands on it got to study it the", "88:06", "the famous parts they're talking about", "88:07", "now it's layered and the way it's", "88:10", "layered is what they're trying to see if", "88:12", "its anomalous elementally or the way", "88:14", "that they're the elements are bound", "88:16", "together and also the atomic level of", "88:19", "layering is what's interesting we'll", "88:22", "find out if we explain what you're", "88:23", "talking about what is this thing that", "88:25", "you saw okay well there is there are a", "88:27", "lot of different samples but when you", "88:29", "get a sample of something and you can", "88:31", "come bigger these samples the ones that", "88:33", "that I looked at they ranged from about", "88:36", "this size they were you know they range", "88:39", "from the size orange-y a size of an", "88:42", "orange to the size of a quarter these", "88:44", "are materials right the materials from a", "88:46", "crash so that's the alleged layer", "88:49", "there's a known crack", "88:50", "this is in the public domain rather than", "88:52", "you know government control so what we", "88:55", "were what I was looking at or having the", "88:56", "scientists look at is isotopically and", "88:59", "elementally what are the elements that", "89:01", "are in this are they engineered and", "89:03", "what's the conclusion well I I'm not I'm", "89:06", "gonna leave it to the people that are", "89:07", "doing it now who have much better", "89:08", "machines than I had a million cliffnotes", "89:11", "yeah they from what I understand there's", "89:15", "atomic layering there there are levels", "89:17", "of like we do with graphene we lay down", "89:19", "these layers that are basically oriented", "89:23", "at a certain degree that's how you get a", "89:24", "superconductor or something like that if", "89:26", "you take a piece of graphene and you and", "89:28", "it's highly machined so it's not doesn't", "89:31", "deviate from that atomic layering you", "89:33", "can push it right through ice thick hot", "89:34", "knife through butter so the weirdest", "89:36", "feeling in the world because you just", "89:37", "take this piece of what feels like", "89:38", "graphene and it goes right through", "89:40", "butter because it's a superconductor and", "89:41", "the heat from your hand melts the ice so", "89:44", "that that is a meta material it doesn't", "89:46", "occur naturally humans created it and it", "89:49", "has special properties because of the", "89:51", "way it's atomically layered so if these", "89:54", "materials are from somewhere else then", "89:56", "they're we suspect that they're going to", "89:58", "be highly machined that they're going to", "90:00", "be created for special use so my whole", "90:02", "point is our material science has not", "90:05", "caught up with the physics that we", "90:07", "understand for these field propulsion", "90:09", "systems I'm just telling you believe me", "90:10", "or not but you'll hear more about it", "90:12", "that that our material science in 1989", "90:16", "and today is our limiting factor and as", "90:19", "our material science gets better as", "90:21", "humans we know how these things work now", "90:24", "the fuel source that's a whole nother", "90:26", "conversation but as far as creating", "90:29", "these machines that's what we're trying", "90:32", "to do that's why there is secrecy we're", "90:33", "trying to exploit the technology because", "90:35", "whoever exploits it first wins it's a", "90:37", "game changer we don't want Russia to do", "90:39", "it we don't want China to do it if we", "90:41", "had a non reactionary propulsion system", "90:43", "the world would look different", "90:44", "instantaneously what what is your", "90:47", "perspective after the incident versus", "90:52", "before the incident like how much did it", "90:54", "change the way you view the world and", "90:56", "our place in the world for me I mean I", "91:00", "always I never believed that we were", "91:02", "alone", "91:03", "me I just look up and go there's way too", "91:05", "many stars up there for us to be my own", "91:06", "place after it you know it makes it a", "91:10", "little more clear to go you know one my", "91:12", "questions are where to come from that's", "91:15", "that's the biggest one of where'd it", "91:17", "come from", "91:17", "what was it doing you know and then I've", "91:21", "asked why me", "91:23", "I mean why why did I happen to be", "91:26", "because you can say wrong place wrong", "91:28", "time right right place to see or right", "91:31", "place right time for me it was I think", "91:34", "there's more out there and if I could", "91:37", "get word out to anyone it's like you",

"91:45", "real incident that happened and number", "91:48", "two is let's open our aperture a little", "91:49", "bit and start thinking outside of the", "91:50", "box you know if you go you know you look", "91:54", "at it go ahead it's it's non reactive", "91:55", "propulsion well it's because when we", "91:57", "came up with propulsion we D we you know", "92:00", "the people long before us came up with a", "92:01", "reactionary propulsion system and that", "92:03", "became our standard had we done", "92:06", "something different or we developed non", "92:08", "reaction we might look at something like", "92:09", "a gasoline engine go holy cow how's that", "92:12", "thing work right we wouldn't have that", "92:13", "idea so you know I think there's you", "92:16", "know if you look at it and go people", "92:19", "thought Einstein was kind of nuts and", "92:21", "we're still proving his theories today", "92:23", "and what we're learning is that he was", "92:25", "right and he was

when you look at that and", "92:38", "you go you know a lot of the stuff that", "92:40", "we thought was true isn't true it's", "92:43", "totally been changed so for me I just", "92:46", "say I think let's get outside of the box", "92:48", "and go if we can develop a technology", "92:50", "that would and I don't look at it from a", "92:52", "military standpoint because it would be", "92:54", "a game-changer from military standpoint", "92:56", "technology like that would be a", "92:58", "game-changer for mankind completely I", "93:01", "mean it would literally everything that", "93:04", "we

well we are three dimension", "93:44", "like I know if you look at like a tall", "93:46", "building is you know 1700 feet high the", "93:47", "big ones and you go no you know for an", "93:50", "f-18

good", "101:57", "feedback and I said I talked to I said", "101:59", "look I'm all for you guys funding a", "102:01", "program but what you need to do is find", "102:03", "a program that there's going to be", "102:04", "oversight over when I say oversight I", "102:06", "mean because what happens is you go", "102:08", "here's money but we're going to", "102:09", "distribute in the government",

so", "102:17", "you give it to them", "102:17", "you know and I'll go back to like the", "102:20", "9/11 stuff where we've really had the", "102:22", "answer but all the agencies weren't", "102:24",

and abuse", "102:52", "flag that we're wasting money on", "102:54", "something stupid now the gimble video", "102:56", "shows a different kind of thing", "102:59", "yes how many different kinds of things", "103:02", "are you aware of well those are ours too", "103:06", "if you look at the go-fast it kind of", "103:08", "looks like a tic tac so you could say", "103:10", "those two are the same", "103:11", "yeah I think there's other stuff out", "103:14", "there you know and sometimes it's not", "103:16", "that the you got to look at where do you", "103:19", "obtain the video it's just like",

Barry seals airplane you know", "103:44", "and then now Barry seals a dead man so", "103:46", "you got to watch when you release", "103:47", "because you go hey we got this video but", "103:49", "it was taken someplace we probably", "103:50", "weren't supposed to be or how did they", "103:52", "get that video right like I look the", "103:55", "video of the tic-tac video that thing", "103:58", "first came out is kind of funny the guy", "104:02", "that was in my backseat had sent me an", "104:03", "email and this is about probably 2008 so", "104:07", "I was retired and he sent me this video", "104:10", "guys say skipper's look familiar", "104:11", "and it was on strange land calm but not", "104:14", "suitable for work just say that but I", "104:16", "look and then next thing you know it's", "104:17", "on YouTube so when I would tell this", "104:19", "story to my friends I would go I'd send", "104:21", "them a link to the YouTube video and", "104:23", "this is", "104:23",

to", "104:36", "look as how did this thing come off of a", "104:37", "classified Drive system on an aircraft", "104:39", "carrier and end up on strange land calm", "104:41", "in YouTube because at the time the", "104:43", "videos were classified secret and that's", "104:46", "not because it was a UFO it's the the 80", "104:48", "Flair video what they did not want that", "104:50", "released so you'd see it on CNN they", "104:51", "blocked out all the performance stuff", "104:53", "what the airplane was actually doing in", "104:54", "this case you know the one you see it's", "104:55", "250 knots
