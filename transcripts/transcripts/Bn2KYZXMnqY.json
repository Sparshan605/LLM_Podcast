["00:00", "hello freak bitches and I attributed it", "00:04", "to cutting out refined sugars and", "00:05", "refined carbohydrates oh yeah I think", "00:07", "that stuff's poison there's been studies", "00:09", "showing it also affects your brain and", "00:11", "negative way as well and people that eat", "00:12", "refined sugar you know there's there's", "00:14", "more brain atrophy I mean there's lots", "00:16", "of correlations the one thing I will say", "00:18", "is that you know there are people that", "00:20", "are super physically active and they're", "00:22", "like working out two hours a day and you", "00:24", "know those guys they'll use refined", "00:26", "sugar just to like yeah you know they're", "00:29", "they're increased transport you know", "00:31", "glucose transported their muscles and", "00:32", "we're using it as an anabolic way to", "00:34", "like get bigger muscle and I know guys", "00:36", "who do that after they work out the", "00:38", "candy yeah I'm and and it it's not like", "00:40", "it's it's you can't compare like people", "00:44", "that aren't working out like two hours a", "00:45", "day or you know like that to normal", "00:47", "people a sedentary people weightlifters", "00:49", "yeah weightlifter people that are just", "00:51", "ripping their body apart there I mean", "00:53", "there's a lot of savages out there that", "00:55", "are doing crazy powerlifting workouts", "00:58", "and benching and squatting and I know a", "01:00", "lot of guys who like to eat candy", "01:02", "afterwards right ya know it's it's", "01:04", "certainly you know I think that those", "01:06", "people you know it they're they're not", "01:09", "it's not it's not acting the same way", "01:11", "it's a radically different requirement", "01:13", "that their body needs right terms of", "01:14", "glucose right and and the thing is I", "01:16", "mean still it's like the way I think", "01:17", "about it is it's not really nutrient", "01:19", "dense you know I like to like I'm like", "01:21", "well there's lots of there's reasons", "01:22", "yeah there's reason why I like to like", "01:24", "take it if you want the sugar and you", "01:25", "know even orange right or an apple or", "01:28", "something like that or you should you", "01:29", "know probably the better move than", "01:30", "eating candy but I think they just want", "01:31", "a ton of it and what is the what's the", "01:33", "anabolic factor look if you were gonna", "01:35", "eat candy or something like that has a", "01:37", "bunch of refined sugar after like an", "01:39", "intense workout what would be the", "01:41", "anabolic factor well the glucose so the", "01:43", "the workout causes glucose transporters", "01:46", "that transport glucose to like go", "01:48", "through the roof and so you start the", "01:49", "Bluecoats from your bloodstream", "01:51", "it's like sucked into the muscle and", "01:52", "then in the muscle you know you're", "01:54", "you're basically you can you can use", "01:56", "that as a way to have insulin and it can", "01:59", "be anabolic right where where whereas if", "02:02", "you weren't doing that then the the", "02:03", "glucose is in your bloodstream and it", "02:04", "can all sorts of small dense LDL", "02:06", "particles can start to form because the", "02:08", "inflammatory transformations that happen", "02:10", "and things like that that's at least my", "02:13", "understanding that's in combination of", "02:14", "course with amino acids which are also", "02:16", "important for the growth of the protein", "02:18", "muscle but that's my understanding of it", "02:21", "I think so", "02:23", "like in general though if someone could", "02:27", "cut one thing out of their diet refined", "02:30", "carbohydrates and refined sugars be a", "02:32", "great way to go I think the one if you", "02:34", "were to think about the one easiest", "02:37", "thing that you could do that would have", "02:39", "the biggest impact on your health and if", "02:41", "you're talking for talking about we're", "02:43", "not talking about someone who's already", "02:44", "paleo or someone like you right we're", "02:46", "talking about like standard American", "02:47", "person yes the one thing that they could", "02:50", "do to have the biggest impact on their", "02:52", "health I would say is to cut out refined", "02:54", "sugar like that's that's probably the", "02:57", "biggest thing you know the easiest thing", "02:59", "I mean I don't know how easy it is that", "03:01", "you know it can be a dick very dick yeah", "03:03", "and that's been shown dopamine levels", "03:05", "you know can get activated game B was", "03:09", "basically proceeded from the idea that", "03:11", "what we live in is a game theoretic", "03:15", "landscape right that the winners in this", "03:18", "game theoretic landscape are individuals", "03:20", "who have figured out where there is a", "03:22", "niche some of them have figured out how", "03:25", "to engage in something called", "03:26", "rent-seeking which rent-seeking", "03:28", "basically means making money without", "03:31", "producing some without producing value", "03:34", "so there's a lot of stuff that goes on", "03:35", "in our economy that is not productive", "03:37", "and good but nonetheless generates", "03:39", "fortunes", "03:40", "so that's rent-seeking as opposed to", "03:41", "innovation or productivity you talking", "03:44", "about like hedge fund type stuff moving", "03:46", "money around well I want to be a little", "03:48", "careful about this because it is quite", "03:50", "possible for things like hedge funds to", "03:54", "actually correct inefficiencies in the", "03:57", "economy in a way that is productive it", "03:59", "doesn't mean that that's the average", "04:00", "thing that so what things are you", "04:01", "referring to well I mean you know let's", "04:04", "let's take the the ultimate example that", "04:06", "will make it clear a warlord is not", "04:09", "responsible for for building the road", "04:13", "that they then stand by the side of and", "04:15", "extort money from people who want to", "04:16", "travel it a cable company may produce", "04:23", "some benefit they obviously have", "04:25", "infrastructure", "04:26", "allows you to get content but what", "04:28", "fraction of what you're paying for is", "04:30", "actually about them delivering a service", "04:33", "at some price and making some reasonable", "04:35", "profit and what fraction of it is about", "04:37", "the fact that they are in economic", "04:38", "Goliath and that you don't have enough", "04:40", "choice to be able to negotiate a decent", "04:42", "price with them so there's some fraction", "04:45", "of what they're producing that is", "04:46", "productive but then there's a large", "04:48", "amount of profit there that isn't about", "04:50", "productivity or innovation it's about", "04:52", "the fact that they own a choke point and", "04:54", "you can't get around it so we don't know", "04:58", "what fraction of the economy is", "05:02", "rent-seeking and what fraction of it is", "05:05", "productive but there especially if one", "05:08", "is broad-minded about thinking about all", "05:10", "the ways that one can engage in", "05:11", "rent-seeking one can actually be", "05:15", "destructive of value if you destroy", "05:18", "future well-being for our descendants it", "05:22", "may look productive in the present but", "05:23", "it isn't productive it's actually", "05:25", "destructive so that's a kind of", "05:27", "rent-seeking that we don't even", "05:29", "typically model but where where were we", "05:34", "headed so oh yes so we live in a game", "05:38", "theoretic landscape that's both good and", "05:40", "bad as you point out competition is a", "05:43", "healthy thing and competition in markets", "05:47", "produces a huge amount of value so I", "05:50", "hear people deriding", "05:52", "capitalism and I always want to make the", "05:54", "same point to them which is you've got", "05:56", "two things glued together and you are", "06:00", "challenging them as a package but", "06:03", "there's no reason they have to be", "06:04", "packaged so we would be foolish to give", "06:07", "up markets markets are amazingly", "06:09", "powerful engines of innovation they are", "06:12", "capable of solving problems that we", "06:14", "cannot solve deliberately even if we", "06:16", "want it to so we need markets but we", "06:20", "don't want markets ruling the planet and", "06:23", "deciding that anything that spits out a", "06:24", "profit is therefore good and that we", "06:27", "should be exposed to whatever the market", "06:28", "discovers can be viable so what we want", "06:33", "is ultimately to provide and provide", "06:38", "incentive structures", "06:39", "that caused the market to produce things", "06:42", "that are good for us", "06:43", "right in other words if you tell the", "06:45", "market that you want the solution to", "06:47", "some problem the market can figure out", "06:49", "how to solve that problem and it will do", "06:51", "it very well but if you allow the market", "06:54", "to decide what problems to solve it may", "06:56", "end up for example addicting you to your", "06:59", "phone right addicting to you to your", "07:01", "phone in a way that harms your social", "07:03", "relationships harms your your parenting", "07:05", "of your children harms all kinds of", "07:07", "things that are really important breaks", "07:08", "the ability of your children to have a", "07:11", "educational experience in school we", "07:13", "don't want the market discovering how to", "07:15", "disrupt useful functioning of people we", "07:18", "want the market to stay out of that", "07:19", "stuff and then to provide us benefits", "07:22", "that only it can provide like all of the", "07:27", "mechanisms that now allow us to navigate", "07:30", "seamlessly in places that we've never", "07:32", "been avoiding traffic that we wouldn't", "07:34", "know to worry about right those are huge", "07:37", "benefits and they're capable of taking a", "07:40", "city that is too snarled with traffic", "07:42", "and reducing the degree to which it is", "07:44", "snarled with traffic so they're very", "07:45", "powerful but we shouldn't we shouldn't", "07:48", "throw the baby out with the bathwater", "07:49", "markets are good", "07:51", "allowing markets to discover any and", "07:53", "every mechanism for exploiting you is", "07:57", "not good at all and in fact it's a large", "08:00", "part of why we're in the predicament", "08:02", "that we're in is that we let the market", "08:03",
