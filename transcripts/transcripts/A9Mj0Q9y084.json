absolutely yeah it's", "00:27", "completely amazing I had no idea that I", "00:30", "would love being a mom so much yeah you", "00:33", "know I I kind of waited till later in", "00:35", "life to have a child and you know that", "00:38", "that was for a reason because I I you", "00:41", "know really driven and and loved what I", "00:43", "was doing in science and I felt you know", "00:45", "I didn't feel that calling to like I've", "00:47", "got to reproduce I've got to reproduce", "00:48", "and then finally I was like well I would", "00:50", "don't reproduce now I might not get a",

you", "03:00", "do even you know aside from your actual", "03:04", "genetics and passing on the sequence of", "03:05", "DNA like just you know things that you", "03:07", "do in your lifestyle actually

aware of that but", "03:19", "did you what did you do to act on that I", "03:21", "should ask yeah so I mean I did I", "03:23", "definitely became obsessed with trying", "03:25", "to optimize everything I could you know", "03:29", "because I'm a scientist and I can sort", "03:31", "of sift through the literature I think I", "03:33", "you can you can kind of get stuck in", "03:35", "this loop or you want to like optimize", "03:36", "everything you can't have to like chill", "03:38", "out a little bit but you know during", "03:40", "pregnancy I wanted to make sure you know", "03:43", "all the micronutrients I was getting you", "03:45", "know cuz they're so important for brain", "03:47", "development and like folate magnesium", "03:49", "iron you know zinc and then DHA vitamin", "03:53", "D all these things were super important", "03:55", "actually with the DHA I found out that", "03:59", "taking so DHA is the marine omega-3", "04:03", "fatty acid that's predominately found in", "04:05", "like microalgae", "04:06", "for vegetarians horses but in fish fatty", "04:09", "fish well it turns out that the DHA", "04:12", "that's in what's called phospholipid", "04:15", "form which is something that's found in", "04:18", "the ROE of fish so like fish eggs", "04:21", "mm-hmm it's also found in krill as well", "04:24", "and fish only have like a small", "04:26", "percentage so fish have", "04:27", "eh-eh like 1% of their DHA is in", "04:29", "phospholipid form whereas the row of the", "04:31", "fish anywhere between 40 to 70% is in", "04:34", "phospholipid form Wow and the thing", "04:36", "that's really cool about this is that", "04:37", "the phospholipid form it's been shown", "04:40", "when you take that orally it stays more", "04:42", "of it ends up in the phospholipid", "04:44", "phospholipid form in the blood that has", "04:46", "been shown to get into the developing", "04:48", "fetal brain ten times better than a DHA", "04:52", "and non phospholipid form free fatty", "04:54", "acid form so is this something that", "04:55", "should be consumed like for regular", "04:59", "people as well or for it's like", "05:00", "primarily mothers so yeah for I think", "05:04", "both but the fact that you you know gets", "05:07", "taken up into the developing fetal brain", "05:09", "ten times you know better was enough you", "05:12", "know", "05:12", "ammunition for me to be like I mean this", "05:14", "is a Monroe you know right but but yeah", "05:16", "so they're all have also been studies on", "05:19", "preclinical studies on on taking DHA up", "05:23", "in fossil performing in mice it's taken", "05:27", "up better than non phospholipid and then", "05:28", "there's been some clinical studies where", "05:30", "they like radio label and follow it in", "05:32", "humans and again it's taken up better in", "05:34", "the brain by humans as well and actually", "05:37", "what's really interesting is I just", "05:40", "submitted a paper for publication on", "05:42", "Alzheimer's disease and a certain", "05:45", "variation in a gene called apoe4 which I", "05:48", "think you and I talked a lot about", "05:49", "traumatic brain injury and", "05:51", "susceptibilities who Alzheimer's disease", "05:53", "and basically um a bunch of you know", "05:56", "dementia type of problems well April", "05:59", "before sort of helps increase that risk", "06:02", "so I've you know turns out there's", "06:04", "because there's different transport", "06:06", "mechanisms to get DHA into the brain the", "06:08", "phospholipid form appears to be better", "06:10", "for April before and that's sort of my", "06:13", "finding I'm not going to get all into", "06:15", "the mechanism but that's hopefully", "06:16", "fingers crossed going to be accepted for", "06:18", "period from peer review with the next", "06:20", "couple of months", "06:21", "that's fascinating so will you eating", "06:23", "salmon roe that's what you were saying", "06:24", "you were getting your source from", "06:26", "I was yeah I was I was eating salmon roe", "06:28", "I was ordering it from a company that", "06:31", "you know has a wild alaskan salmon roe", "06:33", "and they you can buy it in bulk the", "06:36", "company was called vital choice does it", "06:39", "taste nasty", "06:40", "um it tasted nasty during my first", "06:43", "trimester I was like oh wait but you", "06:47", "know it the texture people a lot of", "06:49", "people don't like like Dan doesn't like", "06:50", "the texture because like the salmon roe", "06:52", "is like bigger the fish eggs are bigger", "06:54", "and so it can kind of pop and like you", "06:56", "get like little things to use those to", "06:58", "fish for trout really yeah yeah trout", "07:02", "would eat salmon roe so we would fish", "07:04", "for trout using salmon eggs well I mean", "07:07", "the salmon eggs are like quite a bit", "07:09", "larger right yeah the crab a larger", "07:11", "there's other ones like I think it's the", "07:12", "flying fish that are really small in you", "07:15", "know the the phospholipid DHA and", "07:17", "phospholipid form varies from species", "07:19", "you know different types of fish and", "07:21", "things like that but generally speaking", "07:23", "there you know it's a good thing to eat", "07:25", "and especially during pregnancy so how", "07:27", "did you consume it I'm on of akkad o--'s", "07:30", "I put it on top of avocados with some", "07:31", "lemon juice and like like hot sauce like", "07:34", "so okay just juiced it up kind of like a", "07:36", "paleo jury yeah yeah it's like a lot of", "07:38", "fat so avocados have like potassium", "07:40", "every 101 saturated fat and vitamin E", "07:43", "all the different forms you know so", "07:45", "monounsaturated fat and saturated fat", "07:48", "right they have a small amount of", "07:49", "saturated fat probably a small amount", "07:51", "yeah I know they're when I say they have", "07:52", "like typically when I talk about foods", "07:55", "I'll talk about what's you know what's", "07:59", "concentrated so it's like really", "08:00", "concentrated in 101 saturated fat mm-hmm", "08:03", "so whereas like if you say you know", "08:05", "butter or cheese and it's concentrated", "08:07", "in saturated fat right right but", "08:09", "typically you'll find mono or", "08:10", "polyunsaturated fat in all different", "08:13", "forms of fat just very varying amounts", "08:16", "right and to some degree it's like will", "08:17", "that even really significant it's such a", "08:19", "small amount I don't know no I'm with", "08:21", "how much of the salmon roe were you", "08:23", "consuming it really depends like I", "08:25", "started to really start to ramp my", "08:28", "consumption in like the third trimester", "08:30", "when brain development was like yeah so", "08:37", "every day I was putting a big old", "08:39", "tablespoon full on top of my avocado", "08:41", "really third trimester was like I was", "08:44", "like almost every day trying to consume", "08:46", "it Wow but it was hard for me the first", "08:48", "trimester I was I started to try a", "08:49", "little bit and it made me a little", "08:52", "nauseous like", "08:53", "can read minds well if like it comes out", "08:55", "he's like super brain you know everyone", "08:58", "probably is super biased about their own", "08:59", "children yeah but I'm like he's got", "09:02", "great verbal skills and is super smart", "09:06", "you're super smart like this and you're", "09:08", "eating all these fish eggs these kids", "09:10", "this kids set oh thank you I'll be", "09:12", "interesting talk to him he's gonna be", "09:16", "four sitting right there what's funny is", "09:18", "he was like early on when he was like", "09:20", "six weeks old he was he went through a", "09:23", "really short stage of he was making", "09:26", "sounds that sounded like hello and so my", "09:29", "mom would come over and she would in his", "09:30", "face she would go hello hello and he", "09:34", "would and we have a video of it like I", "09:35", "could send it to you I'll send it to you", "09:36", "he would go oh no and it like literally", "09:39", "seems like he's saying it but clearly", "09:41", "he's not", "09:41", "I mean he's six weeks old you know but", "09:43", "he was able to like sort of mimic the", "09:45", "sound because I think it was easier for", "09:47", "him since he was already sort of making", "09:49", "those sounds so of course Dan and right", "09:51", "and Dan and I were all super pumped were", "09:53", "like he's gonna be a genius we're", "09:55", "sending the video to all the family", "09:57", "members you should really listen to what", "09:58", "we say see that's a Larry of course you", "10:02", "know it he's not really thing hello he's", "10:04", "making noise he's making noise does it", "10:05", "sound like it and there's this totally", "10:07", "coincidental but well this is the", "10:08", "difference between like a kid making a", "10:10", "noise and a kid knowing what that noise", "10:11", "means like when they're actually talking", "10:13", "yeah like my young mom my seven-year-old", "10:16", "well the seven-year-old she didn't", "10:19", "really start talking in full sense until", "10:21", "she was like a year and a half but my my", "10:24", "nine-year-old like when she was like", "10:27", "nine ten months old she was talking it", "10:29", "was weird", "10:30", "it's like she's really smart like she", "10:32", "was talking like right away like and she", "10:35", "stood up quicker too she's she was", "10:37", "standing at like nine months old which I", "10:39", "found pretty shocked yeah well like an", "10:42", "unassisted standing you like that's when", "10:44", "she wanted to stand Wow nine months old", "10:46", "she was like getting her stand on and", "10:48", "trying to take some steps and I was like", "10:50", "this is crazy like she's just she's like", "10:52", "that's how she is like as a little", "10:54", "person - she's a little go-getter uh-huh", "10:56", "yeah I often wonder all you know the the", "10:59", "earlier the firstborns and the ones that", "11:02", "are born earlier like if they get more", "11:03", "attention to because it's not all your", "11:06", "first time", "11:06", "and then as more children come you know", "11:09", "it's like yes your your spread a little", "11:12", "more thin and you know I mean it's not", "11:15", "necessarily the case but it's certainly", "11:17", "something I've often wondered you know", "11:20", "if we if I want to have another child", "11:23", "will I be able to do it you know it's", "11:25", "because I really just wanted there's so", "11:27", "much work that goes into you know not", "11:29", "just you know the nutrition part and I", "11:31", "was talking about you asked me about you", "11:33", "know things during pregnancy and", "11:35", "something I think people don't realize", "11:37", "is that you know epigenetics which is", "11:39", "basically the transference of its its", "11:43", "heritable like you can transfer things", "11:45", "that happened to you and your lifestyle", "11:48", "without actually altering the sequence", "11:50", "of DNA and you can do that by changing", "11:51", "how much gene is activated or not", "11:53", "activated and there's been studies lots", "11:56", "and lots of study stays in animals", "11:57", "showing this to be the case of course", "11:59", "that's animals and how much of that", "12:01", "actually translates to humans but there", "12:03", "was a really interesting study a couple", "12:06", "years ago I think it was like 2015 that", "12:08", "was published that looked at the effect", "12:10", "of obesity and obesity was actually", "12:12", "looked at not in the mothers but the", "12:14", "fathers and so sperm DNA was collected", "12:19", "from four males that were obese and", "12:22", "males that were lean and they there's a", "12:24", "variety of different genes like hundreds", "12:27", "of different genes that were looked at", "12:28", "and about 300 different genes were", "12:30", "different in how they were activated or", "12:32", "not activated in the sperm DNA of the", "12:34", "obese men and a lot of those genes had", "12:37", "to do with cognition learning memory and", "12:39", "metabolism so that's very interesting", "12:42", "but what was super interesting was that", "12:44", "these men they were morbidly obese or", "12:46", "very obese they underwent bariatric", "12:48", "surgery and their sperm DNA was then", "12:51", "collected you know a couple of months", "12:53", "after and then like close to a year", "12:54", "after and as time went on their sperm", "12:58", "DNA looked like the lean people so that", "13:01", "so basically losing the weight just", "13:03", "losing the weight had an effect on these", "13:06", "genes that are involved in cognition and", "13:08", "metabolism like I said you know lots of", "13:11", "animal studies have shown obesity has a", "13:13", "negative effect on like you know causing", "13:16", "type 1 diabetes later in life and", "13:19", "different you know cognitive", "13:20", "disabilities and things like that so you", "13:23", "know it is something like people that", "13:25", "are wanting to conceive might might", "13:26", "consider you know their you know their", "13:29", "health before trying to procreate you", "13:32", "know it's it's I'm not saying that you", "13:34", "know you shouldn't procreate if you're", "13:36", "not you know healthy but it's just", "13:37", "something you know another thing to", "13:39", "think about and and also I think it's a", "13:41", "motivating factor for people because", "13:42", "sometimes you don't care as much about", "13:44", "yourself I mean some people don't", "13:45", "they're just kind of like but their", "13:47", "child or their unborn child that's", "13:49", "probably you know driver for for people", "13:52", "to make a change like that would", "13:54", "certainly hope it would be I mean you", "13:55", "have this opportunity to really", "13:57", "literally change the way your child", "13:59", "develops and just by your discipline", "14:01", "right just by whether or not you're", "14:03", "taking care of your own body you can", "14:04", "literally change the future of your", "14:06", "child", "14:06", "so because you're saying that these", "14:07", "genes that are in this obese man sperm", "14:10", "the way they're represented that's going", "14:12", "to be passed on to the kid", "14:13", "yeah versus the lean version of him Pat", "14:17", "those genes we've passed on to the kid", "14:18", "the kid literally will have a different", "14:20", "starting point because I it's totally", "14:24", "crazy yeah and I mean of course the the", "14:27", "child itself can change things through", "14:29", "epigenetics through their diet lifestyle", "14:31", "but you're giving them a baseline here", "14:33", "right I mean so it's it's it's", "14:36", "definitely a very it's a growing field a", "14:39", "lot of the research is done in in", "14:41", "animals because it's really difficult to", "14:44", "do that sort of these sorts of", "14:45", "experiments in humans but I think that", "14:47", "this is sort of a proof of principle", "14:48", "it's at the very least looking at the", "14:51", "the sperm DNA you know so it's it's", "14:55", "something to consider and I've had like", "14:57", "like friends of friends that have you", "15:00", "know that are that are overweight or", "15:01", "obese and wanting to like have children", "15:04", "and so it's like I try to talk to him", "15:05", "about that in a in a way that's not like", "15:07", "condescending yeah you know some people", "15:09", "some people do have a hard time they try", "15:12", "to lose weight and you know this they", "15:14", "have to find the right combination of", "15:16", "things that works for them but but I do", "15:18", "think that people would get more", "15:19", "motivated if they're like wow I can you", "15:22", "know affect my future child's risk for", "15:24", "type 1 diabetes or for you know like how", "15:27", "well what the right cue is how well", "15:28", "they're performing on learning and", "15:29", "memory test so", "15:31", "and also avoid the horrific guilt that", "15:33", "you would feel if you didn't do that and", "15:36", "you started to see these things", "15:37", "manifesting in your child I realized oh", "15:40", "my god I set this kid up in a shitty way", "15:42", "because I'm lazy which is essentially", "15:44", "what a lot of the problem is with people", "15:45", "it's just that they don't have what", "15:48", "whatever the mental you know people get", "15:50", "angry if you say they're lazy because", "15:52", "they don't die it freaking forget that", "15:53", "word forget to take away the word lazy", "15:55", "you're unmotivated let's say that but", "15:58", "for whatever reason if you choose not to", "16:00", "take care of your health and you see", "16:03", "that transfer into your child's and you", "16:05", "know that you're unhappy with your", "16:06", "existence you know you're unhappy with", "16:08", "your physical body and you refuse to do", "16:11", "or for whatever reason don't do enough", "16:14", "and then you see these same problems", "16:16", "manifesting in your own baby and you", "16:18", "realize like oh my god I started this", "16:19", "kid off in a shitty way like you're", "16:21", "gonna be riddled with guilt totally I", "16:23", "mean the thing is most people don't know", "16:25", "about epigenetics and they don't know", "16:26", "that they're that they're able to do", "16:28", "that so the more the more people are", "16:30", "educated I think the better the outcome", "16:33", "will be but like you said the people", "16:34", "that do know and then still do it it's", "16:36", "like yeah the guilt I mean that's like", "16:38", "unbelievable well it's like people who", "16:40", "smoke when they have a kid you know", "16:42",

don't know I'm sure there's a bunch of", "26:18", "stuff going on I mean your brain just", "26:19", "gets activated like I I do stuff with my", "26:23", "seven-year-old sometimes and half the", "26:25", "time we're doing stuff I'm like I can't", "26:27", "even believe you're real like I'm have", "26:29", "these little conversations with her", "26:30", "we're playing little games and you

that's why it's", "27:14", "very I think it's very difficult for", "27:16", "people that don't have children to sort", "27:18", "of develop that same level of compassion", "27:21", "it sounds like a cop-out it sounds like", "27:22", "it sounds weird but I really do I think", "27:24", "there's something there's actually", "27:26", "something to be gained and as far as", "27:28", "like everyone reproducing well obviously", "27:30", "we have too many people that's not I", "27:32", "don't know if that's the best thing and", "27:33", "I certainly think that you could be a", "27:35", "fully formed healthy wonderful person", "27:39", "who contributes an amazing thing to the", "27:40", "world if you don't have children I don't", "27:42", "think you have to have children but I", "27:44",

"being a parent it was something happened", "27:55", "to me yeah it's it's it's absolutely", "27:58", "life-changing yeah it's I had no idea", "28:02", "like I've always heard people say it's", "28:03", "the best thing that happened to me and", "28:05", "it truly is I mean it truly is the best", "28:07", "thing and so you know I I'm I just I'm", "28:11", "excited to continue to see how it", "28:14", "changes me and it just unfortunately", "28:16", "corresponds with a lot of financial", "28:17", "stress with a lot of people time stress", "28:19", "financial stress lack of sleep and", "28:21", "sometimes I just don't appreciate it you", "28:23", "know it's just you're so overwhelmed by", "28:25", "the burden of just trying to get by that", "28:28", "sometimes you can't appreciate this", "28:29", "amazing moment that happened in front of", "28:31", "you and it's you know it's hard it's", "28:33", "hard to it's hard to have a good", "28:35", "perspective and it's hard it's hard to", "28:38", "like be able to see things from above", "28:40", "let's just sort of rise above and look", "28:42", "at the big picture of this thing totally", "28:44", "and that's for me something that really", "28:46", "helps me that is is exercise sure and", "28:49", "and I think that also", "28:50", "you know I didn't have any postpartum", "28:53", "depression at least I think I didn't I", "28:56", "mean nothing causes that I think there's", "28:58", "a variety of factors I mean so for one", "29:00", "you know you're during pregnancy your", "29:04", "estrogen levels like they like they go", "29:07", "through the roof I mean it's like like", "29:09", "100 fold higher and hundred fold", "29:11", "something like that like it's really", "29:13", "high compared to your baseline and don't", "29:17", "quote me I may be something something", "29:18", "something like that like I've just", "29:19", "ordered an orders of magnitude higher", "29:22", "and estrogen has been shown to increase", "29:25", "the expression of a gene called", "29:27", "tryptophan hydroxylase - in the brain", "29:30", "that produces serotonin from tryptophan", "29:32", "so you're constantly making serotonin", "29:35", "and constantly constantly constantly and", "29:37", "then you know after you have the baby", "29:39", "that goes away so it's kind of like a", "29:42", "withdrawal so that's sort of one", "29:45", "biochemical explanation but there are", "29:47", "many others one I think their circadian", "29:49", "rhythm is off you're not you're not", "29:51", "getting enough light because you're like", "29:53", "nesting you're like you like I don't", "29:54", "think we left I mean I don't remember", "29:56", "going outside for like two weeks", "29:58", "maybe yeah yeah it was like you know", "30:01", "especially with the difficult", "30:02", "breastfeeding it part so it was like", "30:04", "you're constantly inside you're not", "30:06", "getting that bright light exposure your", "30:07", "sleep is completely disrupted so your", "30:09", "circadian rhythm which is you know", "30:11", "extremely extremely important for for", "30:14", "mood for the way you feel that is", "30:18", "completely disrupted because you're", "30:19", "you're waking up you know multiple times", "30:21", "a night and and that's completely gone", "30:24", "and and it's stressful it's like a", "30:28", "completely new experience you have this", "30:30", "like a very fragile baby you know that", "30:33", "you're responsible for and so I think", "30:35", "that combination of all these things", "30:37", "really can can play a role in that and", "30:40", "for me I really tried to make sure I was", "30:44", "getting exercise as soon as I could you", "30:46", "know so that is something because", "30:48", "exercise for a variety of reasons one", "30:51", "it's been shown to increase the", "30:53", "production of serotonin by getting", "30:55", "transport of tryptophan into the brain", "30:57", "so branched chain amino acids which are", "31:00", "found in you know a variety of proteins", "31:03", "they can out-compete tryptophan to get", "31:06", "into the brain and so if you're not", "31:07", "exercising you're constantly getting the", "31:09", "branched-chain amino acids in the brain", "31:10", "which are serving other important roles", "31:12", "but you're not getting that tryptophan", "31:14", "so you're not getting the precursor to", "31:16", "make serotonin and so the exercise", "31:17", "alleviates that that competition", "31:19", "branched chain amino acids get taken up", "31:21", "into your muscle where they're you know", "31:23", "they're used to help build muscle which", "31:24", "is good and the trip pan gets into the", "31:26", "brain so you're making serotonin that's", "31:28", "one - you're making you know endorphins", "31:31", "beta endorphins help so that that's", "31:34", "another thing and then the your your", "31:37", "increasing the production of new neurons", "31:39", "through serotonin and also through brain", "31:41", "derived neurotrophic factor that also", "31:43", "has been shown to help alleviate", "31:45", "depression and prevent depression the", "31:47", "actual neurogenesis the thing that helps", "31:50", "you stay off brain ageing which by the", "31:52", "way there's been like there was like 14", "31:54", "clinical trials that have been analyzed", "31:57", "looking at humans that undergo like", "32:00", "aerobic exercise and how they have like", "32:02", "their left part of their hippocampus", "32:04", "doesn't like atrophy like people who do", "32:07", "not exercise you know so that's like", "32:09", "because the neurogenesis but that that's", "32:10", "another reason you can visually see it", "32:13", "atrophy the use some sort of an MRI yeah", "32:16", "have you ever looked if you like Google", "32:18", "like Alzheimer's disease brain like", "32:20", "there's there's even images all over the", "32:22", "place where they show like before and", "32:23", "after and there's just like big holes in", "32:25", "the brain I mean it's just like well", "32:27", "it's a because someone was comparing it", "32:29", "to a football player mmm was what's the", "32:32", "job the guys named fell off the car the", "32:34", "guy was Henry Chris Henry Chris Henry he", "32:37", "was um I think he was only 28 right he", "32:42", "was a young man who was an NFL football", "32:44", "player and no one had any idea he had", "32:46", "CTE this is like earlier understandably", "32:49", "this is like seven years ago somewhere", "32:50", "around there right um much less", "32:54", "understanding about the the effects of", "32:56", "CTE and he had some sort of an", "32:58", "altercation with his

you know last time you", "36:30", "know a couple years ago but the apoe4", "36:32", "gene I think really is something that", "36:34", "would at least give some insight because", "36:37", "I mean that's known that people that", "36:38", "have at least one allele of those chip", "36:40", "that gene they can you know have really", "36:44", "really bad consequence if they get TBI I", "36:45",

were talking", "37:52", "about exercise and the hippocampus oh", "37:57", "yeah yeah so the the the benefits on", "37:59", "exercise on the brain which I know that", "38:02", "I constantly talk about this to you", "38:04", "because it but it's just so you know", "38:07", "it's so damn important it's so important", "38:09", "so important and and it is it's one of", "38:12", "those things that like it helps me with", "38:13", "everything ways you know and and the", "38:15", "brain aging is like it's like it's the", "38:18", "long-term effect so it helps me with the", "38:20", "short term which is like handling life", "38:22", "and handling stress you were talking", "38:23", "about how people have a hard time you", "38:25", "know seeing things from a higher level", "38:26", "and and it's so true you know because", "38:30", "life is hard you know you have to like", "38:32", "make it you have to survive and if you", "38:34", "don't have a starting place starting if", "38:36", "your baseline is is kind of like you", "38:39", "don't have a lot to start with and it's", "38:41", "you have to work all you know all the", "38:43", "more work you have to put in so I think", "38:45",

"39:02", "effects I get from that you know are", "39:04", "helping with clarity helping me with", "39:07", "being able to kind of take a take a step", "39:09", "back and not be so anxious and there's", "39:11", "there's control trials showing this as", "39:13", "well with with exercise", "39:15", "you know I for the longest time have", "39:18", "been a runner and running is like for me", "39:21", "you know I love the the frame mind I'm", "39:24", "in when I'm running like it's kind of", "39:26", "like this reflective daydreaming which", "39:29", "some people in some studies say well Jay", "39:32", "Dreaming is not good because you're", "39:33", "ruminating when you're daydreaming but I", "39:35", "think the daydreaming that you do when", "39:37", "you're like running is a lot different", "39:39", "from like if you were I had you and I", "39:40", "were having this conversation right now", "39:41", "but I wasn't present oh right right so", "39:43", "that's called rumination and that that's", "39:45", "like that's a stressful kind of", "39:46", "situation you know yeah well you're what", "39:48", "you're not present because you're like", "39:50", "worried", "39:50", "this other thing you have to do right", "39:52", "but the the the daydreaming effect when", "39:54", "I'm running is a little bit more of a", "39:56", "reflective like it's a good it's like a", "39:59", "cleansing for me yes when you run yeah", "40:02", "yeah I saw that you've recently gotten", "40:03", "into that which you know over the past", "40:05", "year that literally blasts January I", "40:07", "started because a friend of mine had a", "40:10", "run-in in Vegas a 5k I jumped in it with", "40:14", "zero running at all it was like guys is", "40:16", "fucking hard I was like I'm in shape", "40:19", "I'll just go run but I never ran", "40:21", "literally never now I run every week and", "40:23", "it was hard for you right cuz yeah right", "40:25", "hard but what's interesting is my cardio", "40:27", "for everything else has gone through the", "40:28", "roof its way because I'm running like", "40:30", "brutal trails like really steep mountain", "40:33", "trails and I'm doing the most ideas for", "40:36", "miles the least I do is one mile", "40:38", "sometimes I do too but it's it's", "40:40", "essentially hill sprints okay so you're", "40:43", "doing soon you're getting some high", "40:44", "intensity in there you're sprinting it's", "40:45", "very high intensity and it's all it's", "40:47", "all like really extensive cardio it's", "40:49", "like yeah heavy duty stuff right I've", "40:51", "run it with my dog now dude that's", "40:52", "awesome so what's interesting is for me", "40:55", "after pregnancy like I couldn't wait to", "40:58", "go out running and so I think it was", "40:59", "four weeks and phobics before weeks", "41:01", "postpartum I went out for a run I saw", "41:03", "your Instagram post yeah okay so went", "41:05", "out for a run I was super EXTREME us", "41:07", "poly the only post I did because what I", "41:09", "found out as I was running is I didn't", "41:12", "feel so great like I felt like my", "41:14", "bladder felt full even though it wasn't", "41:16", "like and so I would stop in bathroom", "41:18", "like when I run and then I was like okay", "41:20", "and run again it still felt full and I", "41:23", "was like this is not normal like this", "41:25", "you know so so I went to my OBGYN talked", "41:29", "to him and apparently your pelvic floor", "41:32", "like changes after having a baby and", "41:34", "that can like you know fall down and", "41:38", "kind of hit your bladder a little and so", "41:39", "it feels some women actually like pee", "41:41", "urinate when they're running like I", "41:43", "never had it like that well he looked at", "41:45", "my pelvic floor it was like on a scale", "41:47", "from zero to ten zero being the best", "41:49", "you're a 1 and I'm like really because I", "41:51", "feel like a 7 you know and so he was", "41:54", "like well you probably shouldn't have", "41:55", "started running so soon so don't do that", "41:57", "why don't you start doing some", "41:59", "low-impact exercise and start doing", "42:00", "these like strength like strengthening", "42:03", "your pelvic floor with like cake", "42:04", "like some core strings which I've been", "42:06", "doing so I was like crap what am I gonna", "42:08", "do like running I would just walk out", "42:11", "the door and go you know run and that", "42:12", "was like my escape so I started doing", "42:15", "this this cycling class high-intensity", "42:18", "interval cycling class which is it's an", "42:21", "hour long and it's a spin class but it's", "42:23", "not like the dance you spend so it's", "42:25", "it's a spin class where you do hills and", "42:28", "sprints and it's it's an hour long but", "42:31", "you're mixing it with just aerobic and", "42:33", "so you're you get these Sprint's and", "42:35", "these hills and I really really really", "42:37", "liked it for multiple reasons you know", "42:39", "one is the group setting where I feel", "42:42", "like the people around me I'm like", "42:45", "they're still going at it you know so", "42:46", "it's like motivating so I I keep going -", "42:48", "there's something about that group that", "42:50", "really like I push if I throw just me on", "42:53", "that bike for an hour there's no way I", "42:55", "would be pushing it like I do that like", "42:56", "I am pushing it it's like amazing", "42:58", "pushing it yeah I feel that way about", "43:00", "yoga class same thing yeah I think", "43:03", "everyone's eating off each other right", "43:05", "right and then also having the", "43:06", "instructor like there's a couple", "43:08", "instructors that I really really like", "43:10", "and you know because I like their style", "43:12", "and they're kind of more like coaches", "43:13", "than the kind of instructor that kind of", "43:15", "makes you want to feel there's the", "43:17", "instructor that's like they their", "43:19", "cheerleader kind of want to make you", "43:21", "feel good and then there's the", "43:22", "instructor where they're like the coach", "43:23", "where they're like they're trying to", "43:24", "help you write better so I kind of", "43:27", "designed city high intensity interval", "43:29", "training and I've never really been into", "43:31", "it that much like I was you know I would", "43:33", "do some like jump squats and things like", "43:36", "that like at home but this is the first", "43:38", "time I'm like really a structured", "43:39", "environment and really doing it so I", "43:41", "started reading about it like morning -", "43:42", "no because that's how I am if I do", "43:44", "something I'm like well I'm gonna look", "43:46", "into it and either it'll motivate me to", "43:48", "like really keep it up and do it more or", "43:50", "I'll be like now this isn't good you", "43:51", "know so I started reading more and more", "43:53", "about it and it's amazing the benefits", "43:55", "of the high intensity so you were", "43:57", "talking about how how like you're you're", "44:00", "I think what you were describing was", "44:01", "your aerobic capacity generous change", "44:03", "for the big one is kickboxing", "44:05", "like the wind when I hit the bag it used", "44:08", "to be that I would I would struggle to", "44:10", "do a three minute round of high high", "44:13", "intensity like hitting the bag", "44:15", "kickboxing but now I can I get", "44:18", "through it the bell goes off and I'm", "44:19", "like really okay like the Bell just went", "44:21", "off all right that's three minutes and", "44:23", "then I'll have the 30-second rest by the", "44:25", "term 30-second rest is up I'm fully", "44:27", "recovered and I'm back in again I just", "44:29", "it's I mean like I have more than double", "44:32", "the endurance I used to have so so", "44:34", "they're there what you're experiencing", "44:36", "has been studied in clinical studies", "44:37", "basically this aerobic capacity also", "44:40", "people call it vo2 max which is", "44:43", "basically the ability of your lungs and", "44:45", "your blood and your heart to carry", "44:47", "oxygen to your muscles or places that", "44:49", "are you know during that intense push so", "44:52", "the capacity to do that right well as we", "44:55", "age over the age of 25 once we hit 25", "44:58", "and we continue on our aerobic capacity", "45:00", "decreases by 10 percent per decade so", "45:03", "like 1 percent per year right so you're", "45:05", "basically you know 25 you're 35 you're", "45:08", "your vo2 max your is like 10 percent", "45:10", "less than you were when you were 25 well", "45:13", "it turns out doing these high intensity", "45:14", "interval classes doing 24 of them which", "45:17", "in this study it was like they were 40", "45:19", "minutes long and there was four foremen", "45:22", "it pushes and there's you know", "45:23", "recoveries in between and all that blah", "45:26", "blah blah stuff they were able to", "45:27", "improve and after eight weeks of doing", "45:30", "24 high-intensity classes improve their", "45:32", "vo2 max by like 12% so you're basically", "45:34", "adding a decade you know back how many", "45:38", "weeks well they did it they did 24", "45:40", "classes of this in eight weeks Wow so", "45:42", "what this interesting thing about that", "45:44", "study was they were also testing whether", "45:45", "or not like like doing it I think was", "45:49", "like four weeks or something really like", "45:50", "short just packing them all in they", "45:53", "actually didn't increase the vo2 max as", "45:55", "much because the recovery time was", "45:57", "actually important it's actually changed", "45:58", "the way I think about when it comes to", "46:00", "training and my advice that I give to", "46:02", "people for training because I used to", "46:03", "think that it was adequate to just do", "46:05", "the sports specific workouts like say if", "46:07", "you wanted to get better at Jiu Jitsu", "46:09", "just do your jujitsu if you want to get", "46:10", "better kickboxing just do your kick", "46:12", "boxing the cardio you get from that will", "46:14", "be enough I don't think that's the case", "46:16", "anymore because I'm stunned at how much", "46:18", "of an increase in car do that I've", "46:20", "gotten from these hill sprints and now I", "46:22", "realize like okay what you can do is", "46:24", "that you can do it independently of that", "46:28", "work and it doesn't really mess", "46:30", "that work like say if I run in the", "46:32", "morning and I get a good two-mile run I", "46:35", "can still hit the bag at 3:00 in the", "46:37", "afternoon but the difference will be is", "46:40", "I like my legs will be tired from", "46:43", "running but they're not the same muscles", "46:45", "that I use when I kick box but what's", "46:47", "it's it's similar in a lot of ways but", "46:49", "with what's really changing for sure is", "46:51", "that my aerobic capacity yeah it's just", "46:53", "way bigger this is awesome just", "46:55", "different that's actually a marker of", "46:56", "aging aerobic capacity vo2 max I've", "46:58", "never actually measured my own vo2 max I", "47:04", "don't want to do it because now that I'm", "47:06", "doing all this high-intensity work and", "47:08", "I'm totally gonna stick with it like I", "47:09", "love it um I definitely want to get back", "47:13", "to the running and I've been sort of", "47:14", "worried about I can only do so much as a", "47:16", "new mom and working in a treadmill er", "47:20", "now you know I love running outside like", "47:23", "in nature whether it's in the beach or", "47:26", "like in the hills rolling hills and", "47:28", "stuff but you know for the longest time", "47:30", "I lived in Tennessee and that the", "47:34", "weather there is not great and so I did", "47:36", "you treadmill running and so yeah I mean", "47:38", "I've definitely I don't I don't have the", "47:41", "same day dreaming like effect yeah I", "47:44", "agree yeah that I do definitely I mean", "47:46", "it's it's definitely good and I get a", "47:49", "lot from it from a treadmill but there's", "47:51", "something about in fact there was some", "47:53", "interesting study that I don't know how", "47:55", "long ago maybe a year ago or two that", "47:57", "looked at people that exercise I think", "47:59", "they went for like walks or something in", "48:01", "nature versus like in the metropolitan", "48:04", "area and the benefits there was there", "48:06", "was more benefits in going for the walks", "48:08", "in nature in terms of like you know", "48:11", "psychological benefits but also some of", "48:13", "the variety of like biomarkers that were", "48:14", "measured um", "48:16", "so it's kind of interesting you know it", "48:19", "is interesting I think we like to think", "48:20", "of ourselves as being detached from what", "48:23", "we experience just in terms of even just", "48:25", "visually but III think that those things", "48:28", "have an effect on like not just how you", "48:30", "think like how you feel but who you are", "48:33", "I mean I think we are we have some sort", "48:36", "of a symbiotic relationship with our", "48:38", "environment and when your environment is", "48:40", "cement and glass and concrete and rubber", "48:43", "and", "48:43", "all the things that we've created in", "48:45", "cities that there's a doll feeling that", "48:48", "you get from those things and then when", "48:49", "you can go and see a green meadow and", "48:51", "birds flying around and and the wind", "48:54", "whistling through the leaves like you", "48:56", "you just it does something to your body", "48:58", "look does something not just your mind", "49:00", "there's something going on like you", "49:03", "you're you have like this feeling that", "49:05", "I've ah this is medicine like this is", "49:07", "I'm getting something out of this yeah", "49:09",

were", "51:45", "certainly some things that I opted out", "51:47", "of that were probably more standard of", "51:51", "care you know so just because of concern", "51:56", "and and not that I knew for

saying is is true there is like", "53:02", "even on the CDC website it says that you", "53:05", "know some of these vaccines can cause", "53:07", "fevers and epileptic seizures these", "53:10",

"53:20", "and and how the immune the immune system", "53:24", "responds to some of these vaccines", "53:25", "especially if you're giving like five at", "53:27", "once I mean the the first round of", "53:30", "vaccines that I'm supposed to do it was", "53:32", "like it was like five different vaccines", "53:34", "and so what I'm opting to do is actually", "53:37", "do them in singles were you so that they", "53:39", "really did yeah yeah because it's like", "53:42", "why the immune response is you know kind", "53:46", "of the thing that's scary and you don't", "53:47", "really know how a child's immune systems", "53:50", "going to react and there are studies I", "53:52", "was particularly worried about it during", "53:54", "pregnancy and that's when one of the", "53:55", "things I opted out of was getting the", "53:58", "Tdap vaccine which is they want to give", "54:01", "it to you when your I forgot how many", "54:03", "weeks pregnant thirty something I think", "54:06", "and to protect basically pass on", "54:09", "antibodies for whooping cough you know", "54:11", "to the to the baby and so I opted out", "54:13", "and I said I would do it post basically", "54:15",

"vaccine but I was gonna do it after I", "54:24", "had me and that and the reason I made", "54:26", "that decision is because there have been", "54:28", "multiple studies now in non-human", "54:31",

"55:40", "to vaccinate my son and I have been", "55:42", "doing singles and the you have to like", "55:44", "it's a little more inconvenient because", "55:45", "you have to go to the doctor like so",

to", "55:55", "be as strong and there's a problem with", "55:57", "this conversation and one of the", "55:58", "problems with this conversation is as", "56:00", "soon as you talk about vaccines you", "56:02", "immediately get lumped into a bunch of", "56:04", "fucking crazy people that think that", "56:06", "vaccines are some sort of a conspiracy", "56:08", "and the government's trying to make",

because", "56:18", "you're talking about chemicals that", "56:19", "you're injecting into a child right yeah", "56:22", "but still people are very hesitant to to", "56:27", "even look at that",

did as standard", "57:27", "care during the 1960's are now", "57:29", "prohibited like we know they're", "57:31", "dangerous for you", "57:32", "yeah yeah I mean III completely 100%", "57:34", "agree and I think that the", "57:36", "there there are now it's a growing field", "57:38", "at least in science where there are", "57:40", "there are scientists that are trying to", "57:42", "understand the the gene interaction the", "57:45", "gene interaction with the immune system", "57:47", "because it you know obviously almost", "57:50", "everyone gets vaccinated right I mean", "57:52", "and you don't have everyone walking", "57:54", "around with all these and with autism", "57:56", "and all these but there there is", "57:58", "something that is you know going on and", "58:00", "you know a lot of parents have noticed", "58:02", "changes of course after the vaccinations", "58:04", "and so there there is a new field of", "58:08", "inquiry and I do know that's ongoing", "58:09", "where

reason", "58:48", "I even delayed I've only you know given", "58:49", "my son to vaccines so far but just", "58:51", "because I'm trying to like exhaustively", "58:53", "read the literature as much as I can oh", "58:56", "good for I'm glad you I'm glad that", "58:58", "you're looking at it this way because", "58:59", "it's it's something that there's a lot", "59:02", "of pressure on people to not

been", "79:26", "irresponsibly telling people to do that", "79:28", "to like I said I think ketogenic diet I", "79:31", "responded very well to it so I've been", "79:32", "telling people to get on that record", "79:34", "least try it so for what is exactly the", "79:37", "gene what is the issue so they're so", "79:39", "PPAR alpha mmm-hmm it changes it's it's", "79:43", "a gene that's involved

is", "80:10", "you're not you're not metabolizing the", "80:12", "fatty acids and producing the ketone", "80:13", "bodies quite as well and so you end up", "80:15", "having more free fatty acids

was kind of getting at first and", "81:16", "that's the theory at least right like we", "81:18", "don't we can't prove that but but there", "81:20", "are scientists looking at like different", "81:22", "regions like people that live for", "81:23", "example in northern Europe how they ate", "81:24", "more fat and they're able to do that", "81:26", "better and so there are scientists that",

lot", "81:35", "like with the ketogenic diet there's", "81:38", "it's something that I've become really", "81:40", "interested in recently because I've been", "81:42", "you know following in the field and it", "81:45", "appears you know as though there is a", "81:48", "really there's something about it that", "81:51", "is really important for the way your", "81:53", "mitochondria age like it really seems to", "81:55", "help your mitochondria age better and I", "81:58", "think that there's you know there's", "81:59", "multiple I talked to a", "82:01", "a sort of an expert he's the president", "82:03", "of the buck Institute for research on", "82:04", "Aging and his name is Eric Burdon and he", "82:08", "just recently published a really big", "82:10", "paper showing that in animals cyclic",

yeah so that and this is the how", "82:30", "these questions for him that I that I", "82:31", "asked him about and the cyclic so it was", "82:35", "every other week so one week they were", "82:38",

"is because for whatever reason animals", "82:48", "when they just when you just give them", "82:50", "food to eat like like ad libitum", "82:52", "like whenever they want even if it's a", "82:54", "ketogenic they'll just still keep eating", "82:56", "like so just keep eating it like and and", "82:58", "they can become it can become an", "83:00", "obesogenic diet where they're where they", "83:02", "become fat and it can actually decrease", "83:03", "their lifespan even though it's", "83:05", "ketogenic and I think that's partly", "83:07", "because fatty acids in order to use them", "83:11", "they have to get inside the mitochondria", "83:13", "to be used and it has energy and if they", "83:16", "don't get inside the mitochondria then", "83:18", "they just get taken up into adipose", "83:19", "tissue and stored as fat and fatty acids", "83:22", "themselves will when the levels are high", "83:24", "enough shut that transport system that", "83:27", "does that off so it's like a negative", "83:29", "regulator so if you just keep on", "83:30", "bombarding the body with fat fat fat fat", "83:32", "fat like non-stop without arrest then", "83:35", "you start to like not be able to use", "83:37", "those fatty acids because it inhibits", "83:39", "the transport system it's called the", "83:41", "Carnot old Palma toll transferase for", "83:43", "those nerdy nerdy biologist geeks out", "83:45", "there that that you know so anyways I", "83:48", "totally dragged right address there it's", "83:52", "um yeah the cyclic energetic die so that", "83:55", "that was something that extended their", "83:56", "health ban and it's became very", "83:58", "interested in that and so the thing", "84:00", "that's super interesting and as I was", "84:01", "talking to dr. purdon about this is that", "84:04", "you know there's a couple of things one", "84:06", "obviously you're not getting a lot of", "84:08", "blood glucose hits all the time right", "84:11", "when for the most part if you don't have", "84:12", "a gene polymorphisms that are", "84:14", "the way you process a trait of fact", "84:16", "right so you're not your your your", "84:18", "insulin response is not happening quite", "84:20", "as often that's lowered and there's", "84:21", "there's there's benefits with from that", "84:22", "alone right but for someone like me that", "84:25", "doesn't eat refined sugar doesn't eat", "84:27", "any refined carbohydrates I mean all of", "84:29", "my carbohydrates come from leafy greens", "84:31", "or vegetables and you know berries and", "84:34", "some some some other fruits you know so", "84:37", "and my blood glucose levels have always", "84:39", "been pretty pretty good like you know", "84:41", "fasting blood glucose and all that with", "84:44", "the exception of my lack of sleep", "84:45", "recently and you know but so the", "84:48", "question I wanted to know was like okay", "84:50", "well what else is going on and it seems", "84:52", "as though the production of the major", "84:54", "circulating ketone body", "84:55", "beta-hydroxybutyrate", "84:56", "really is having an anti-aging role and", "85:00", "you know dr. Friedens work showed that", "85:03", "it it's it's changing the expression of", "85:04", "genes and it's like activating longevity", "85:07", "genes and all this but the thing that's", "85:08", "super super interesting to me is that", "85:10", "the way it's metabolized by mitochondria", "85:13", "is different than other energy sources", "85:16", "and without getting too much into", "85:19", "chemistry it's it's not in order to", "85:22", "produce energy you have to use something", "85:24", "called electron reducing quote", "85:25", "equivalence and they can be in the form", "85:26", "of nad NADH ratio or F ad to age and so", "85:33", "it's not going through one of those", "85:34", "pathways that generates more free", "85:36", "radicals and more basically leaky", "85:38", "electrons that can damage mitochondria", "85:40", "it doesn't go through that pathway like", "85:41", "other energy sources so it's like you", "85:44", "end up net not not you know basically", "85:47", "having lower lower inflammatory and", "85:50", "lower oxidative damage to your", "85:51", "mitochondria it also doesn't have what's", "85:53", "called pro to prote anaphoric activity", "85:55", "so it's almost like the way your body", "85:57", "your mitochondria is metabolizing it is", "85:59", "better because metabolism you're", "86:02", "constantly generating damage like damage", "86:05", "constantly right now all the time it's", "86:06", "you're just from normal metabolism and", "86:08", "it seems as though there's something", "86:10", "about that beta-hydroxybutyrate", "86:11", "that's superior and it's it's it's", "86:15", "definitely got me super interested in it", "86:17", "and you know for like the longest time I", "86:20", "was thinking well I'll get my beta", "86:21", "hydroxy butyrate by doing time", "86:24", "restricted eating right where I'm eating", "86:26", "all my food within like 10 hours yeah", "86:28", "and then I'm fasting for 14 hours and", "86:31", "I'm you know depending on how I what", "86:34", "your activity levels are and all that", "86:35", "how quickly you deplete your liver liver", "86:37", "glycogen you can start to make", "86:38", "beta-hydroxybutyrate", "86:39", "even within like seven hours if you're", "86:40", "really active you know so I was like", "86:42", "well I'm getting my beta hydroxy", "86:44", "butyrate from the fasting part of the", "86:45", "timer shit-eating right but I have", "86:47", "become super interested in in this", "86:50", "possible even because there's other", "86:52", "reasons I don't need a ketogenic diet", "86:54", "like to get all the micronutrients I", "86:56", "like to get prebiotic fiber you know", "86:59", "that's really good for the gut", "87:00", "microbiome but then again I don't we", "87:02", "don't know exactly how can you genic", "87:04", "diets you've been affecting the", "87:05", "microbiome so that's sort of still an", "87:06", "open you know open field so I I'm sort", "87:10", "of thinking can I do some sort of cyclic", "87:12", "you know ketogenic diet and also for me", "87:14", "because I have a belief or I do eat", "87:17", "saturated fat but I eat it from like", "87:18", "Whole Foods I don't like I used to do a", "87:21", "lot of cooking with coconut oil which is", "87:23", "high in saturated fat and I'm like what", "87:25", "do I need to do that for like I don't", "87:26", "really need to cook with coconut oil I", "87:28", "can use avocado oil you know and so I", "87:30", "changed that and my LDL just dropped 20", "87:32", "points from just that alone you know so", "87:35", "it's like an end but L do overall not", "87:38", "large versus small yeah my LDL overall", "87:40", "the first time so my baseline I didn't", "87:42", "measure small then so I don't know what", "87:44", "my baseline was but I did measure the", "87:46", "large so the large and like I said the", "87:49", "large can transform into the small vents", "87:51", "and so with with refined sugars with", "87:54", "refined sugars that's what's know but", "87:56", "like you mentioned genetics there may be", "87:57", "something that we don't know what what", "88:00", "is the mechanism for the transference of", "88:02", "a law with the the sugar with the LDL", "88:05", "like what what causes it to become small", "88:07", "dense I'm not sure we entirely", "88:09", "understand that yeah just because you", "88:11", "know there's a correlation there", "88:12", "definitely a correlation in there has", "88:14", "been showed in clinical studies to not", "88:15", "just be correlation but causal where you", "88:17", "give people refined sugar and they're a", "88:19", "small vessel yeah so same diet same diet", "88:22", "adding refined sugar you see a radical", "88:24", "difference you measure they're small", "88:26", "dense LDL before giving them the refined", "88:28", "sugars same diet and then you measure", "88:29", "after this the Kasota you know blasts of", "88:32", "refined sugar for three weeks and", "88:34", "they're small dense LDL particles going", "88:35", "through the roof", "88:36", "so that's causal because you're giving", "88:38", "them something you're measuring it", "88:39", "before and after effect", "88:40", "and if there's anything that we can", "88:42", "conclusively point to it's that refined", "88:44", "sugar is absolutely bad for you", "88:47", "there's no doubt about that right I", "88:49", "think so I think that you know there's", "88:51", "so many studies that have shown you know", "88:53", "the inflammatory biomarkers go up you're", "88:55", "a small dense LDL biomarkers go up", "88:57", "there's correlation studies showing that", "88:59", "people that you will find sugar have", "89:01", "like telomeres which are a biomarker for", "89:03", "aging that look 10 years older you know", "89:05", "even though people they're the same", "89:06", "chronological age as other people that", "89:08", "don't eat the refined sugar their", "89:09", "studies and men would like they give men", "89:11", "75 grams of refined sugar and their", "89:13", "testosterone drops by 25%", "89:15", "I mean it's changing a lot of things you", "89:18", "know in the body and in a negative way", "89:20", "well mine my testosterone doubled when I", "89:23", "changed my diet when I cut out the pasta", "89:25", "when I cut out the bread and I started", "89:27", "eating more saturated fat more protein", "89:29", "and I went to the ketogenic diet", "89:32", "literally it doubled doing everything", "89:34", "exactly the same it's it was stunning", "89:36", "and I felt different", "89:38", "like I filled the difference feel the", "89:40", "difference is my energy levels feel the", "89:42", "difference cognitively the cognitive", "89:44", "thing was a big thing and I attributed", "89:46", "it to cutting out refined sugars and", "89:47", "refined carbohydrates yeah I think that", "89:49", "stuff's poison there's been studies", "89:51", "showing it also affects your brain and", "89:53", "negative way as well and people that eat", "89:55", "refined sugar you know there's there's", "89:57", "more brain atrophy I mean there's lots", "89:58", "of correlations the one thing I will say", "90:00", "is that you know there are people that", "90:03", "are super physically active and they're", "90:04", "like working out two hours a day and you", "90:06", "know those guys they'll use refined", "90:09", "sugar just to like yeah to you know", "90:11", "their increased transport you know", "90:13", "glucose transported their muscles and", "90:15", "are using it as an anabolic way to like", "90:17", "get bigger muscle and I know guys who do", "90:19", "that after they work out the candy yeah", "90:21", "I'm and and it it's not like it's it's", "90:24", "you can't compare like people that", "90:26", "aren't working out like two hours a day", "90:27", "or you know like that to normal people", "90:29", "aspiration sedentary people weight", "90:31", "lifters yea weightlifter people that are", "90:33", "just ripping their body apart there I", "90:35", "mean there's a lot of savages out there", "90:37", "that are doing crazy powerlifting", "90:40", "workouts and benching and squatting and", "90:42", "I know a lot of guys who like to eat", "90:44", "candy afterwards right ya know it's it's", "90:46", "certainly you know I think that those", "90:48", "people you know it they're they're not", "90:51", "it's not it's not acting the same way", "90:54", "different requirement that their body", "90:55", "needs right terms of glucose right and", "90:57", "and the thing is I mean still it's like", "90:59", "the way I think about it is it's not", "91:00", "really nutrient dense you know I like to", "91:02", "like I'm like well there's lots of", "91:04", "there's reasons yeah there's reason why", "91:06", "I like to like take it if you want the", "91:07", "sugar and you know eat an orange right", "91:09", "or an apple or something like that or", "91:10", "you should you know probably the better", "91:11", "move than eating candy but I think they", "91:13", "just want a ton of it and what is the", "91:15", "what's the anabolic factor like if you", "91:17", "were gonna eat candy or something like", "91:19", "that has a bunch of refined sugar after", "91:21", "like an intense workout what would be", "91:23", "the anabolic factor well the glucose so", "91:25", "the the workout causes glucose", "91:28", "transporters that transport glucose to", "91:29", "like go through the roof and so you", "91:31", "start the Bluecoats from your", "91:32", "bloodstream", "91:33", "it's like sucked into the muscle and", "91:34", "then in the muscle you know you're", "91:37", "you're basically you can you can use", "91:38", "that as a way to have insulin and it can", "91:41", "be anabolic right where where whereas if", "91:44", "you weren't doing that then the the", "91:45", "glucose is in your bloodstream and it", "91:47", "can all sorts of small dense LDL", "91:49", "particles can start to form because the", "91:51", "inflammatory transformations that happen", "91:52", "and things like that that's at least my", "91:55", "understanding that's in combination of", "91:56", "course with amino acids which are also", "91:59", "important for the growth of the protein", "92:00", "and muscle but that's my understanding", "92:02", "of it I think so like in general though", "92:07", "if someone could cut one thing out of", "92:10", "their diet refined carbohydrates and", "92:13", "refined sugars be a great way to go I", "92:16", "think the one if you were to think about", "92:18", "the one easiest thing that you could do", "92:20", "that would have the biggest impact on", "92:22", "your health and if you're talking about", "92:24", "we're not talking about someone who's", "92:26", "already paleo or someone like you right", "92:27", "we're talking about like standard", "92:29", "American person yes the one thing that", "92:32", "they could do to have the biggest impact", "92:34", "on their health I would say is to cut", "92:36", "out refined sugar like that's that's", "92:38", "probably the biggest thing you know the", "92:41", "easiest thing I mean I don't know how", "92:43", "easy it is that you know it can be a", "92:44", "different very dick yeah and that's been", "92:46", "shown dopamine levels you know can get", "92:49", "activated and then also your gut biome", "92:50", "correct your gut biome literally has an", "92:54", "impact on what you desire right yeah it", "92:56", "does so your your the the thing about", "92:58", "your microbiome and your gut is that", "93:00", "like you know the the the microbiome", "93:03", "eats it's at the distal part of your gut", "93:05", "so it's in the colon right the large", "93:07", "intestine the", "93:08", "and of the large intestine is where most", "93:11", "of the trillions of bacteria are and", "93:12", "those bacteria actually eat the", "93:15", "fermentable fiber that we don't digest", "93:18", "we don't we don't process and the", "93:20", "fermentable fiber comes from a variety", "93:21", "of plants from from plants and from", "93:25", "seeds and nuts and you know legumes as", "93:30", "well outs you know so there's different", "93:32", "types of fermentable fiber that are", "93:33", "found in different types of foods and", "93:35", "they feed different species of bacteria", "93:37", "well when you don't get enough of that", "93:40", "fermentable fiber what ends up happening", "93:42", "in fact it's been studies showing that", "93:44", "like 75% of the microbiome population", "93:46", "changes and like when when you don't get", "93:49", "at all any fiber and what happens a", "93:52", "couple of things one is those mic those", "93:54", "bacterial species they start to eat the", "93:56", "carbohydrate that's lining your gut", "93:58", "called mucin which is what makes up the", "94:01", "gut barrier that separates the immune", "94:02", "cells in your gut from the bacteria they", "94:04", "start to eat it because it's", "94:05", "carbohydrate and so you actually start", "94:07", "to break down your gut barrier just from", "94:09", "that the second thing that happens is", "94:11", "what you mentioned is that a lot of the", "94:12", "pathogenic bacteria will swim up to the", "94:14", "small intestine where they're usually", "94:15", "not supposed to be small intestine is", "94:17", "where you absorb sugar protein fats they", "94:21", "swim up there and guess what sugar they", "94:24", "start so they start to like eat the", "94:26", "sugar and they start to multiply and the", "94:28", "thing about having bacteria in the small", "94:30", "intestine where it's not supposed to be", "94:31", "is that it causes the same response that", "94:34", "that eating gluten causes where it", "94:37", "basically those those it's called small", "94:39", "bacteria intestinal overgrowth and what", "94:42", "happens is that the tight junctions that", "94:44", "make up the gut barrier start to open up", "94:47", "and open up and that allows the", "94:49", "inflammatory immune cells to be in", "94:52", "contact with bacteria and of course", "94:53", "immune cells go Oh bacteria and they", "94:55", "start to like try to kill it because", "94:56", "they think it's not supposed to be there", "94:58", "it could be potentially harmful", "94:59", "pathogenic bacteria and so they starts", "95:02", "to set off an immune response", "95:03", "inflammatory immune response and the", "95:05", "more you have the more sugar you eat the", "95:07", "more your this population of bacteria is", "95:10", "flourishing so so that's like that's", "95:13", "another thing that's that's um that's", "95:15", "changing that but it's also the one of", "95:17", "the reasons like I was saying you know", "95:19", "with them and I've never actually tried", "95:21", "a ketogenic diet", "95:22", "but because you know for various reasons", "95:26", "but I I'm not sure how much plants you", "95:29", "eat like what like can you eat like a", "95:31", "good amount of can you get likes it", "95:33", "really depends on the individual you", "95:35", "know you know on a very small scale Rob", "95:37", "wolf and his wife have done some pretty", "95:39", "interesting tests where they'll both eat", "95:41", "the same thing and they'll both test", "95:42", "themselves he'll test the both of them", "95:44", "you know X amount of minutes later and", "95:46", "they have a radically different response", "95:47", "between the two of them it's really", "95:49", "interesting like his wife is much more", "95:51", "resilient and he has much more of a", "95:53", "difficult time getting back into ketosis", "95:54", "it's really he's documented a lot of it", "95:57", "on his his Instagram page but I think it", "95:59", "speaks to what you were talking about", "96:00", "before that it really depends on where", "96:03", "your ancestors evolved and it really has", "96:06", "there's different we very biologically", "96:09", "so much right we do and and that's that", "96:12", "that you know affects how we respond to", "96:13", "these foods and all that you know but um", "96:16", "anyways what was the other thing I", "96:19", "wanted to ask you about oh the NAD to", "96:22", "remember the NAD I was talking about", "96:24", "like the nad and NADH ratio and energy", "96:27", "so this is something what does any do", "96:29", "stand for again nicotinamide adenine", "96:32", "dinucleotide and it's something it's", "96:34", "something that um it's kind of in a way", "96:38", "similar to ATP where it's like used as", "96:41", "an energetic currency throughout the", "96:43", "body for various things but it's", "96:46", "actually like required to like for your", "96:49", "metabolism like you need it to", "96:50", "metabolize you know fatty acids and", "96:54", "glucose and you know amino acids but you", "96:57", "also you need it to repair damage you", "97:00", "need it you know for a variety of other", "97:02", "things that are happening and the thing", "97:05", "is is that these energy levels in", "97:08", "tissues that are very energetically", "97:10", "demanding they deplete so for example if", "97:13", "your immunes if you have chronic", "97:14", "inflammation and your immune systems", "97:16", "can't connect chronically being", "97:17", "activated the nad levels are going to", "97:19", "that it's kind of like triaging and so", "97:21", "what happens is your metabolism suffers", "97:23", "and it's been shown now that nad levels", "97:26", "in like you know multiple tissues with", "97:29", "age they deplete lots of preclinical", "97:32", "studies have shown that you know plays a", "97:35", "role in the aging", "97:36", "process and if you for example take like", "97:37", "a mouse that has progeria this Pro aging", "97:40", "phenotype and then you give them the NAD", "97:42", "it like can like basically kind of", "97:44", "rescue that in a way and they like live", "97:46", "a more normal health span and more", "97:47", "normal lifespan so it's like and there's", "97:49", "lots of studies showing that in various", "97:51", "ways there's recently been a lot of", "97:53", "interest in it because the nad there's a", "97:56", "way to replenish it through supplemental", "97:59", "form called nicotinamide right aside so", "98:01", "nad is actually formed from vitamin b3", "98:03", "like nicotinic acid or nicotinamide or", "98:08", "from tryptophan but nicotinamide right", "98:10", "aside is another precursor that you can", "98:13", "take in supplemental form and there's", "98:14", "been you know studies over the past few", "98:16", "years looking at how in animals it's", "98:19", "been able to increase nad levels it's", "98:21", "able to like basically improve physical", "98:23", "performance cognitive performance it's", "98:25", "able to you know make your tissues aged", "98:28", "better or your organs aged better in", "98:29", "animals so now there's like been", "98:33", "preclinical trials that are sorry", "98:34", "clinical trials that have been under", "98:36", "undergoing one showing that you actually", "98:40", "can take the supplemental form of nad to", "98:42",

to", "105:36", "someone reduce your saturated fat intake", "105:39", "you're gonna lower the LDL risk and it", "105:41", "regardless of all the other stuff", "105:42", "they're doing you know it

well for me I guess my genes", "106:02", "are a little different but likely", "106:03", "wouldn't have the same effect so if you", "106:05", "were to take that same population of", "106:07", "people and say okay eat your saturated", "106:10", "fat but take out the refined sugar we", "106:13", "may see the same thing where the L where", "106:15", "the heart disease risk goes down just", "106:17",

proof of principle there but I", "106:36", "do think that it's it's it's an", "106:38", "important point and it's something that", "106:39", "the American Heart Association they're", "106:41", "they're now starting to at least", "106:43", "mentioned the small dense LDL particles", "106:45", "so I think that moving in that direction", "106:48", "is good because it means that possibly", "106:50", "then you know over the next decade we're", "106:52", "gonna start to see okay now we got a", "106:55", "start it's not just the LDL I'm confused", "106:57", "about something you just said you said", "106:58", "if you replace saturated fat with", "107:00", "refined sugar if you replace the", "107:03", "saturated fat with refined sugar if you", "107:06", "sorry refined carbohydrates

that's what are the data in", "107:34", "aggregation looking at the clinical", "107:36", "trials looking at the mechanism looking", "107:38", "at the observational studies and", "107:39",

I've", "107:56", "read who have criticized this that are", "107:58", "actually scientists and researchers they", "108:00", "have a huge issue with that statement", "108:02", "they think that this is

exactly what happens and", "108:20", "and the same thing goes with with the", "108:22", "protein and it being bad as well and", "108:25", "there's all sorts of nuances in the", "108:26", "combination of the protein with the", "108:27", "with the bad diet and also the exercise", "108:30", "which is one of the one of the things", "108:32", "with the with the protein is that it", "108:34", "increases

"114:38", "how important they are and I've and I've", "114:41", "studied even in people things like", "114:43", "biomarkers of aging like DNA damage and", "114:45", "seeing how they change with different", "114:47", "micro nutrient intakes or different", "114:48", "types of fiber intakes or you know", "114:50", "things like that so so I you know for me", "114:53", "I kind of I'm a little biased in that", "114:56", "sense but um you know it's it's the", "114:58", "approach that I like to take you know", "115:00", "for example this is a really good story", "115:02", "my mentor Bruce aim Bruce Ames who I", "115:04", "talk about a lot he was the inventor of", "115:06", "the Ames test which is a test that", "115:08", "really cheap tests that you can do this", "115:09", "to determine whether or not something to", "115:11", "carcinogen in fact I'm sure the", "115:12", "heterocyclic amines were determined from", "115:14", "his tests because you can dump something", "115:16", "on and he can base it basically can tell", "115:17", "you like in a matter of minutes right so", "115:19", "he's that was his like he he was", "115:23", "um pioneered that back in like the late", "115:24", "70s early 80s and he was responsible for", "115:27", "getting carcinogens out of hair dye", "115:28", "women's hair dyes out of children's", "115:30", "pajamas lots of lots of really big", "115:33", "health impact studies what's in pajamas", "115:35", "there was some kind of polyurethane ish", "115:39", "thing I don't remember exactly it's not", "115:40", "there anymore but it was in it was it", "115:43", "was to prevent them from it was a flame", "115:44", "retardant it was a flame retardant and", "115:46", "it was it was completely a carcinogen", "115:48", "and it was ending up in children's urine", "115:50", "and stuff they were measuring it yeah so", "115:52", "anyways my point is is that he used to", "115:55", "be this whole like cancer chemical", "115:57", "carcinogen field and then one day like", "116:01", "you know someone in his lab did an", "116:02", "experiment where they like left full", "116:04", "laid out of the sample and there was", "116:06", "like massive amounts of DNA damage", "116:08", "happening he's like what's going on here", "116:10", "and they started to do this in in mice", "116:12", "and found that like a low folate dialate", "116:15", "diet caused damage to DNA the same as", "116:18", "being irradiated by an x-ray machine the", "116:21", "exact same and then he went into people", "116:23", "and found you know there was like a", "116:25", "really small ex-pilot experiment but", "116:27", "similar the the cause DNA damage on", "116:29", "people that had a low folate diet and he", "116:31", "said that one experiment right there", "116:32", "changed the whole course of his field of", "116:35", "study where he all of a sudden went into", "116:37", "nutrition and micronutrients and that", "116:38", "became his thing from the 80s on and", "116:40", "kind of from an accident yeah from an", "116:42", "accident doesn't that happen all the", "116:43", "time in lab all the time it's what's", "116:45", "best stuff it was funny because the guy", "116:47", "in his lab was like calling he was", "116:49", "trying to figure out what is going on", "116:51", "here and then he he looked his assistant", "116:53", "had ordered this media that you put on", "116:55", "cells and he looked at the media try to", "116:57", "figure out was in it and they saw it was", "116:59", "a specific type of media that the", "117:01", "assistant had ordered incorrectly that", "117:03", "lacked folate and so this whole thing", "117:06", "was all started from that and so", "117:08", "incredible yeah so he published a", "117:10", "seminal paper where literally he", "117:11", "compared mice being irradiated under an", "117:14", "x-ray machine to low folate and it was", "117:17", "identical now would that be something", "117:19", "that people should take into their diet", "117:21", "of say if there are flight attendants or", "117:24", "pilots because don't they isn't like", "117:26", "flying like a form of radiation you do", "117:29", "get some radiation that's similar to an", "117:31", "x-ray right yeah I mean that's it the", "117:34", "folate it's a different mechanism", "117:36", "by how its preventing it basically", "117:37", "folate is needed to make a actual", "117:41", "precursor to DNA and without that", "117:43", "precursor you don't make the DNA right", "117:45", "and you incorporate a nucleotide from", "117:47",

"117:58", "and things like that and have been", "118:00", "measured yeah it's been measured and", "118:03", "there was a really weird study that came", "118:04", "out recently that astronauts they had", "118:08", "like exceptionally longer telomeres then", "118:11", "yeah where it's like it was totally", "118:13", "counterintuitive where DNA damage", "118:15", "usually causes telomeres to get shorter", "118:18", "and so like if you were to have asked me", "118:20", "I would have predicted that if the", "118:23", "astronauts would have had shorter", "118:24", "telomeres definitely some weird stuff", "118:26", "going on we don't understand you know", "118:29", "but um and there's obviously a variety", "118:31", "of other things you can do to protect", "118:33", "yourself from that but I forgot why the", "118:35", "whole point is that the micronutrients", "118:37", "were important Bruce Ames has been my", "118:39", "mentor and friend for many years and and", "118:41", "I've sort of been in this field of study", "118:43", "for a while and so it's it's it's it's", "118:46", "how I think about food and doesn't mean", "118:48", "it's the best way but it's the way that", "118:50", "I've convinced myself so far with the", "118:53", "tools that I have available to me that", "118:55", "that's how I like to eat and again", "118:58", "anyone that's doing any sort of diet", "118:59", "should always measure biomarkers and", "119:01", "things like that to know if it's working", "119:02", "for them and what's a good source of", "119:04", "folate leafy greens in fact my Bruce's", "119:08", "mentor when he was a graduate student is", "119:09", "the guy who identified he actually", "119:11", "discovered Foley by identifying my", "119:13", "sliding it from spinach so spinach yeah", "119:17", "leafy greens are great source of folate", "119:19", "but the leafy green like the other thing", "119:22", "that gets me on this and I know I talked", "119:23", "about this last time was like other", "119:24", "compounds that are in the in the plants", "119:26", "where we're sort of just scratching the", "119:28", "surface on understanding them like what", "119:30", "they're doing in our body is like one", "119:31", "for example is lutein its president", "119:34", "leafy greens kale is a really really", "119:35", "great source of it lutein is like its", "119:38", "found in the first of all it was known", "119:40", "that new lutein is important for the", "119:42", "rods and cones in your eye and so people", "119:43", "like they'll take supplements with", "119:44", "lutein to help with their vision but all", "119:46", "this recent research over the last few", "119:48", "years is found is like", "119:49", "in large amounts in the brain like what", "119:52", "is looting doing in the human brain well", "119:55", "it turns out it's like there's been", "119:56", "clinical studies now controlled trials", "119:58", "like giving people looting and and and", "120:00", "and it's it plays a role in in cognition", "120:02", "like people have better learning and", "120:04", "memory scores after taking lutein it's", "120:07", "involved in and crystallized", "120:09", "intelligence which decreases with age", "120:10", "you know so there's like there's things", "120:13", "like that another one is this one that", "120:15", "I'm really interested in now I'm", "120:16", "actually supplementing it with pqq and", "120:19", "that one is it's made by bacteria and", "120:22", "bacteria in the soil so it's made by", "120:24", "bacteria because it's important for it's", "120:27", "a cofactor for enzymes for their", "120:29", "metabolic enzymes to work well plants", "120:31", "take it up from soil and then we take", "120:33", "eat the plants and get in our diet and", "120:35", "it's it's been shown now in like in a", "120:38", "few studies lots and lots of preclinical", "120:40", "studies that's been shown to like", "120:41", "regulate mitochondrial function improve", "120:43", "mitochondrial function clinical a couple", "120:45", "of clinical trials now have been done", "120:46", "looking at how it affects humans if you", "120:48", "supplement with like 20 Meg's a day", "120:50", "improves cognition it also improves", "120:52", "markers of mitochondrial function lowers", "120:55", "markers of inflammation well it turns", "120:57", "out pqq has like 20,000 times the", "121:02", "catalytic activity then something like", "121:06", "ascorbic acid so it's really powerful", "121:09", "antioxidant and what I mean by that is", "121:10", "so ascorbic acid goes through cycles of", "121:13", "vitamin C it's it's either oxidized or", "121:16", "reduced and it can it when it when it", "121:18", "when it does its antioxidant thing it", "121:20", "becomes oxidized and they can do that", "121:21", "four times where it goes it donates you", "121:24", "know it donates this this hydrogen and", "121:26", "you know help it helps you know", "121:28", "basically combat reactive oxidative", "121:30", "stress but then it gets oxidized again", "121:32", "and it can do it again four times P Q", "121:34", "cube does it 20,000 times like isn't", "121:38", "that mind-blowing 20,000 times and it's", "121:40", "really concentrated in breast milk so", "121:42", "I'm actually taking it right now it's", "121:45", "it's super interesting it seems like", "121:47", "something everyone should stop them but", "121:48", "I think maybe so yeah because you know I", "121:55", "you know you never really know but I'm", "121:59", "supplementing with it and and I", "122:01", "certainly", "122:03", "don't notice anything because like", "122:05", "sometimes those those sorts of changes", "122:07", "are really hard to measure and", "122:10", "especially you have to wait until I mean", "122:11", "who knows like later on in life but it I", "122:14", "think it may be something that's", "122:16", "important that maybe has beneficial", "122:20", "effects in in humans as well so and like", "122:23", "again you can you get it from plants but", "122:25", "20 milligrams a days when I'm taking", "122:26", "because that's what the two different", "122:28", "clinical trials have shown what's the", "122:29", "best plant source of it I don't know", "122:31", "what the best I'm sure you could find", "122:33", "that Google but because various berries", "122:36", "plants take it up from the soil so", "122:38", "probably things that are growing in the", "122:40", "soil right that would be the best but", "122:43", "yeah it's like it's found like five or", "122:44", "six fold higher and higher levels that", "122:47", "it is in our tissues and plants of", "122:48", "course because the plants are the source", "122:49", "of it but but yeah taking a supplemental", "122:52", "form you'll be getting orders of", "122:53", "magnitude more do you have a supplement", "122:56", "company that you rely on the most I do", "122:59", "so the thing with supplements is that", "123:02", "there's they're really risky there's", "123:05", "lots of studies that have been published", "123:06", "showing that a lot of supplements don't", "123:07", "contain what they say they contain or", "123:09", "they contain a fraction of it and they", "123:10", "got a bunch of other filler like clover", "123:12", "leaf and stuff so one of the supplement", "123:15", "companies so and and there's a scientist", "123:17", "friend of mine his name is dr. Jed Fahey", "123:19", "he's like he's a guy who discovered that", "123:22", "broccoli sprouts are the best source of", "123:23", "sulforaphane", "123:24", "he he measured a variety of supplements", "123:28", "and he was looking specifically at like", "123:29", "precursors to sulforaphane and he looked", "123:32", "at a variety of different companies and", "123:34", "one of the companies that was just", "123:36", "really really really good and reliable", "123:39", "was thorn thorn th o RN E and that's", "123:42", "something I don't have any affiliation", "123:44", "with him or anything but that I always", "123:45", "they're my go-to brand whenever I'm", "123:47", "looking for a supplement like I took I", "123:49", "took their prenatal from throughout", "123:50", "pregnancy actually I'm still taking the", "123:53", "prenatal I'm breastfeeding I take their", "123:55", "vitamin D and vitamin k2 I take pretty", "123:59", "much a lot of my stuff comes from them", "124:01", "and the pqq however that I've only been", "124:05", "able to find from life-extension and I", "124:07", "think life extensions pretty okay so far", "124:10", "it's like I can tell but thorn is like", "124:12", "my my favorite company so far", "124:17", "just because I've got data from a", "124:18", "scientist that I you know trust yeah", "124:21", "it's it's a difficult issue and tainted", "124:23", "supplements are a huge problem with", "124:25", "athletes a lot of false positives or not", "124:28", "even false positives a lot of athletes", "124:30", "will take supplements like if they go to", "124:32", "like some just generic vitamin store you", "124:34", "know whatever name the name and they", "124:36", "pick up some sort of a creatine or", "124:38", "muscle enhancer or this or that and a", "124:41", "lot of them are tainted with steroids or", "124:43", "they're used in the same labs or created", "124:46", "rather in the same labs and they don't", "124:47", "clean the bins and so like the vats that", "124:50", "they used to mix up one supplement will", "124:53", "the whatever was in residual traces of", "124:56", "it will wind up in some other stuff Wow", "124:58", "real issue I think there's um what", "125:00", "you're referring to there a lot of", "125:02", "supplement companies that have a stamp", "125:04", "on it called NSF which is the National", "125:06", "sanitary foundation I believe they go", "125:09", "and they investigate where the the", "125:11", "supplements manufactured and they look", "125:13", "at the quality and they also I think", "125:16", "even look at some some of the what's in", "125:18", "the supplements if the if they contain", "125:19", "what they're supposed to contain to some", "125:21", "degree but I know they definitely look", "125:23", "at the manufacturing place to see if", "125:25", "things like that were you know things", "125:27", "aren't being cleaned right and there's", "125:28", "contamination and all that so", "125:30", "supplements that have that stamp are", "125:31", "probably a little more reliable than", "125:33", "ones that don't but it's still not like", "125:35", "a sure thing right so it's not like it's", "125:39", "just because it has that stamp it's it's", "125:40", "going to be the best I think a lot of", "125:42", "people listen to this they're gonna", "125:44", "probably have to listen three or four", "125:45", "times and take notes and go over this", "125:46", "and try to figure out if if they're", "125:48", "gonna do something how to act a lot of", "125:51", "people have a hard time digesting all", "125:53", "this data and trying to figure out what", "125:55", "is the best way to proceed in terms of", "125:58", "investigating their own health and like", "126:01", "monitoring their blood levels and trying", "126:03", "to find a primary care doctor that will", "126:05", "kind of understand what they're trying", "126:06", "to do yeah I mean the the the primary", "126:10", "care doctor thing finding one I", "126:12", "certainly can't help with that because I", "126:13", "mean that's the struggle that you and I", "126:15", "have but you know in terms of taking", "126:17", "taking your own health into your own", "126:19", "hands and monitoring blood biomarkers I", "126:21", "mean there's a there's a few that are", "126:23", "really really key I think for anyone", "126:26", "doing anything any type of", "126:27", "experimentation that that they should do", "126:29", "and we've we've talked about the more", "126:30", "ready you know the the small dense LDL", "126:32", "the total LDL you also want to measure", "126:35", "triglycerides high sensitive c-reactive", "126:37", "protein HP 1hp a1c which is the your", "126:41", "marker of long-term fasting blood", "126:42", "glucose but also there's another test", "126:44", "that you can do that actually is a", "126:47", "really comprehensive metabolic tests to", "126:49", "measure how your body's metabolizing", "126:51", "carbohydrates fatty acids and amino", "126:53", "acids it's called the organic acid test", "126:56", "and Genova Diagnostics offers it and", "126:59", "unfortunately you do have to get your", "127:01", "primary care physician to prescribe or", "127:04", "to like order that because that's not", "127:06", "something that's that's available to", "127:08", "people but it seems like there's room", "127:10", "for a company to do this like a one-stop", "127:13", "shop company that sort of analyzes your", "127:16", "health and prescribes to you you know it", "127:19", "explains to you what's lacking in your", "127:21", "diet and what you could benefit from and", "127:23", "what you can seems like there's there's", "127:25", "a big opening for some sort of a", "127:26", "business like that yeah I mean I think", "127:28", "some people are actually doing it like", "127:29", "Genova Diagnostics I think is one they", "127:31", "do sort of do that like though they'll", "127:33", "tell you what's missing or like they'll", "127:35", "help interpret your data and Genova", "127:38", "diagnostics and is it a nationwide", "127:40", "company a nationwide yeah but I don't", "127:44", "know about worldwide so if you're in", "127:46", "Europe yeah yeah yeah so but and I think", "127:50", "there's other companies that are kind of", "127:51", "you know like wellness effects kind of", "127:53", "is doing that a little bit as well they", "127:54", "give you a consult with someone after", "127:56", "you get a variety of blood markers", "127:58", "measured and you know that you try to", "128:01", "help you figure out that as well and you", "128:03", "know so it's it's certainly I think", "128:04", "there's there are other people it's just", "128:06", "a matter of finding a good one it's", "128:08", "always the the catch right yeah it seems", "128:11", "like with this kind of stuff for the", "128:13", "average consumer the average person is", "128:15", "listening to this it seems very daunting", "128:17", "it's like boy there's so much to think", "128:19", "about there's so I mean and a lot of", "128:21", "times when people get inundated with", "128:22", "that much data they sort of shut down", "128:24", "right I can't do this this is too much", "128:27", "and I really wish there was like a", "128:31", "nationwide network of places like that", "128:33", "so he could just go to sort of like you", "128:36", "can go to you know a dentist it should", "128:38", "be like a place where you go to to get", "128:39", "this kind of

still", "128:49", "figuring out all those nuances and so it", "128:51", "you know even even getting the data", "128:53", "having the person interpreted it's you", "128:56", "know it's constantly

like constantly yeah", "129:04", "because we're we're constantly changing", "129:05", "the way we think about a variety of", "129:08", "things and it would seem like someone", "129:09", "billionaire

but", "129:32", "then he says it's bullshit he's never", "129:33", "done it oh really he did say was yes oh", "129:36", "ok find that Jamie Peter Thiel denies", "129:38", "ever getting injected with young blood", "129:41", "okay good to know", "129:42", "yeah it is there there I know the the", "129:44", "clinical trials that were doing done at", "129:46", "Stanford I don't know if they've been",

some", "137:27", "hot cocoa with a hundred percent cocoa", "137:29", "and I just tastes like ass and like I", "137:30", "need some stiff", "137:31", "it's like otherwise you're just doing a",

don't", "137:44", "really use a lot of stevia like my", "137:45", "in-laws they they like to put it in", "137:48", "their smoothies because I've gotten so", "137:50", "used to my smoothies tasting

so", "138:41", "they're drinking the diet coke it's kind", "138:43", "of ironic that it's like it's like", "138:45", "making the more be obese by changing the", "138:48", "gut microbiome no is is it safe to drink", "138:51", "just one can every now and again or is", "138:53", "it something you sure one can every now", "138:55", "and then it's okay you know it's not I", "138:57", "mean it's not going to like completely", "138:59", "not 12 cans a day or even one kanaday", "139:01", "you're constantly going to certain your", "139:02", "microbiome you're constantly going to", "139:04", "keep

diet", "139:15", "coke I haven't had diet coke was like", "139:18", "2006 I had one yesterday in the hotel", "139:21", "cracked it open really I really haven't", "139:24", "had one since 2006 cold yeah I used to", "139:27", "drink I'm I used to drink them when for", "139:31", "lighting college and stuff to stay awake", "139:33", "and study for exams and all that but if", "139:35", "you're taking something like that should", "139:37", "you take a corresponding like some sort", "139:40", "of a probiotic to try to combat that", "139:42", "I mean the problem with that is you know", "139:45", "the probiotics which by the way there's", "139:48", "all sorts of interesting studies that", "139:50", "have shown effectiveness of certain", "139:51", "probiotics that are you know have a lot", "139:53", "of that have live bacteria and a lot of", "139:55", "them but you know in order for the", "139:58", "probiotics to work you either have to", "140:00", "constantly take them or there needs to", "140:03", "be space in your gut for them to take", "140:04", "residence in right so if you're like", "140:06", "filling your body with all sorts of", "140:08", "sugar or diet coke and all this then", "140:10", "where where's the probiotic that you're", "140:12", "taking in gonna attach right so it's", "140:15", "kind of flow through and the flow", "140:16", "through has benefits but you have to", "140:18", "keep taking it you know for that for", "140:20", "that to happen so the so really a", "140:23", "healthy diets the way it's not you can't", "140:24", "just counteract with supplementation", "140:26", "healthy healthy diets the way we need", "140:28", "you know the the fermentable fiber which", "140:31", "is what helps grow helps the the", "140:33", "commensal and good

graduate school and so that", "140:44", "definitely helped me and I don't I I", "140:48", "take him once in awhile now like you", "140:50", "know but I don't I don't take them every", "140:51", "day like I did you know when I was like", "140:53", "trying to like heal myself and and the", "140:55", "one I was taking I think we've talked", "140:57", "about was 450 billion", "140:59", "it's called VSL number three but now", "141:01", "there's another company called vis biome", "141:02", "that it's like the guy who made this BSL", "141:05", "number three is doing this visible make", "141:07",

"141:14", "been clinical clinical studies with both", "141:16", "of them showing effectiveness and so", "141:18", "it's it's certainly an interesting field", "141:22", "growing field and there happens in the", "141:24", "clinical studies in humans were for", "141:25", "example the one that's super interesting", "141:28", "the brain the brain stuff the way it's", "141:30", "affecting the brain is interesting and", "141:31", "there's clinical studies there was one", "141:33", "recent one I think I tweeted where there", "141:35", "was like 10 randomized control trials", "141:36", "they weren't

immune system will affect the", "141:54", "brain immune system", "141:56", "definitely is connect you know basically", "141:58", "inflammatory factors and things like", "142:00", "that can cross over

normal", "142:34", "healthy people need to take probiotics", "142:35", "all the time and I don't know the answer", "142:37", "but I do think that we need to eat the", "142:39", "right foods to to get

like you kind of have to", "144:57", "like you've got these like you were", "144:58", "showing with the icita meta fin and ADHD", "145:01", "we risk like you're not gonna have a", "145:04",

your", "152:41", "research that is involved in whatever", "152:43", "you're investigating the sugar industry", "152:45", "is particularly bad but it's not always", "152:47", "the case like I was involved in research", "152:49", "with blueberries and the research was", "152:51", "funded by the highbush blueberry council", "152:54", "and so we did this placebo controlled", "152:56", "trial where we were looking at you know", "152:58", "there's a whole panel of scientists", "153:00", "involved and I was just one of the", "153:01", "scientist", "153:02", "when I was looking specifically

things and", "153:12", "there was a placebo group so enormous", "153:15", "amount of work you know we had isolate", "153:16", "blood from patients they were they were", "153:18", "given this blueberry powder they were", "153:20", "taking twice a day for eight weeks or", "153:22", "placebo powder and then we had to know", "153:24", "look at their DNA damage and what my", "153:28", "work found was that", "153:30", "to my surprise so blueberries lowered", "153:32", "DNA damage which is what I thought", "153:34", "because they have a variety of compounds", "153:36", "in them that are known to be", "153:37", "antioxidants but what was really", "153:40", "surprising to me was that it the placebo", "153:42", "actually lowered DNA damage just as well", "153:45", "if not better than the blueberry powder", "153:47", "and the placebo powder had a little bit", "153:50", "of refined sugar in it and some like", "153:53", "coloring food coloring and stuff and so", "153:55", "I was like what's going on here how is", "153:57", "the sugar lowering DNA damage well it", "154:00", "turns out I had looked at gene", "154:01", "expression data as well all these genes", "154:03", "that are that are involved in stress", "154:06", "response and in hormesis the reason i", "154:09", "was looking at that is because there are", "154:10", "certain compounds in the blueberries", "154:11", "that can have a hormetic response and i", "154:13", "wanted to see if that was being", "154:14", "activated well it wasn't really robustly", "154:18", "being activated in the blueberries but", "154:19", "in placebo some of these pathways the", "154:22", "same pathways that like sulfur frame can", "154:23", "activate really well to some degree was", "154:25", "being activated because we think it was", "154:27", "slightly stressful of course it was a", "154:29", "very small amount of sugar and also the", "154:31", "the dyes that were used or have been", "154:33", "shown to cause a little bit of a", "154:34", "hormetic response but you know we're", "154:36", "gonna publish that day it's not like", "154:37", "because the blueberry foundation funded", "154:41", "this study you know you know it's the", "154:43", "the data is still this data is the data", "154:45", "we didn't you know change anything so", "154:49", "it's not always the case and again", "154:50", "there's something very interesting here", "154:52", "and like you said science always", "154:55", "surprises you and always the things that", "154:57", "you like it's something to predict it's", "155:00", "completely the opposite and there's", "155:01", "something always interesting there", "155:02", "always you know it's like as humans we", "155:05", "think we know biology and we're like oh", "155:06", "this is going to be predicted to be that", "155:08", "and all of a sudden it's complete", "155:09", "opposite and you're like what's going", "155:11", "every time you come on the podcast oh", "155:13", "I'm reminded of the fact there's so much", "155:15", "data", "155:15", "is impossible to keep it on in in your", "155:18", "head and especially for one person we", "155:20", "dealing with all these different fields", "155:22", "all these different different scientists", "155:25", "working on all these different studies", "155:26", "and it's almost impossible for one", "155:29", "person to have all this data in their", "155:31", "head yeah it is but it's interesting to", "155:35", "me yeah oh it's fascinating it's", "155:37", "unbelievably fascinating but it's one of", "155:39", "the reasons why boiling something down", "155:41", "to a clickbait title of an article is so", "155:44", "in it's so enticing because it's like Oh", "155:46", "tell me high fat diet kills demise fuck", "155:49", "that", "155:49", "all right I'm dum dum going back a low", "155:51", "fat vitamins give you cancer that's", "155:54", "gonna make a headline yeah yeah when you", "155:56", "think cellairis yeah you have to dig", "155:58", "into him when you're like wait a minute", "155:59", "yeah yeah the the sugar industry study", "156:02", "was from the 1950s and 1960s yeah", "156:04", "probably pretty difficult to have", "156:05", "something that biased and and fraudulent", "156:08", "today there was even another one that", "156:10", "just came out recently like we talked", "156:12", "about one last year but there was", "156:13", "another one that came out another study", "156:15", "I think it was published in like pas or", "156:17", "PLoS ONE of those two showing that they", "156:19", "they suppress data that that refined", "156:22", "sugar played a role in cancer and in", "156:25", "heart disease so so and this was the 70s", "156:28", "I believe so there's more more than one", "156:31", "you know study that have now linked them", "156:34", "to basically holding back data from", "156:38", "being published you know so they're", "156:41", "there one that's definitely I would say", "156:43", "pretty bad I had someone send me some", "156:45", "review articles that were basically", "156:47", "stating that refined sugar was not bad", "156:49", "and the review articles were were funded", "156:51", "by the sugar foundation and I was like", "156:53", "oh this is the one I usually don't say", "156:55", "this like I usually don't say like you", "156:58", "know based on who funds the study like", "157:00", "just the conflicts of interest you know", "157:01", "disclosures but this is the one time", "157:03", "where it's like you know the sugar", "157:05", "foundation they're just notoriously bad", "157:07", "well it's also contrary to everything", "157:09", "else that's been established right yeah", "157:10", "when you understand it's like when you", "157:12", "look at like I say all those things the", "157:13", "mechanism and you look at the", "157:15", "interaction between foods and how the", "157:17", "bodies you know processing these things", "157:20", "and you look at the observational data", "157:21", "and controlled trials I mean you know", "157:23", "how many things can you say you know no", "157:27", "- I mean just you know", "157:28", "just looking at one thing there you know", "157:31", "that's not as strong but you know", "157:33", "looking at all of it is the big picture", "157:35", "there's just so much money and sugar so", "157:38", "many things have sugar in them I mean", "157:40", "what we've allowed to have done in this", "157:42", "country is literally allowed this one", "157:46", "thing this one substance to be in I mean", "157:49", "what percentage of our food do you think", "157:50", "has sugar in it well I mean if you go to", "157:54", "a restaurant or you go to get some", "157:57", "condiments food yeah I mean those things", "158:00", "there's there's it's Lipton everywhere", "158:01", "like Thai food you know it's like you go", "158:03", "it's like oh this tastes sweet like", "158:05", "sugar yeah it's got sugar in it you know", "158:09", "so it's certainly but that's almost", "158:11", "acceptable it's like I get what you're", "158:13", "doing trying to make something taste", "158:14", "delicious because

right that I kind of get you", "158:27", "know but what I don't get is that it's", "158:30", "permeated our entire diet the the", "158:34", "average American diet it's it's in", "158:36", "everything it's in the drinks we drink", "158:38", "it's in the foods we it's in the bread", "158:41", "that you consume it's in the pasta it's", "158:42", "in the spaghetti sauce it's in I mean", "158:45",

"158:56", "you're gonna see it much more often than", "158:59", "you're not going to see it right", "159:00", "stunning yeah I know that happened to me", "159:03", "not long ago when I like sent Dan to the", "159:05", "store to get some like some kind of like", "159:07", "I was wanting some wisher sauce like for", "159:10", "my steak for some reason I was like why", "159:11", "having a nostalgic thing I was like wait", "159:14", "a minute no I can't eat this is it sugar", "159:16", "in it yeah yeah Worcestershire sauce", "159:18", "tastes like shit why is it have sugar", "159:20", "because it take more tastes more like", "159:22", "shit if it didn't it it for whatever you", "159:25", "know it's something I like a girl and I", "159:27", "had this craving for it and I've seen as", "159:30",

gross", "159:55", "she thinks it's hilarious she'll squirt", "159:57", "it right at our tongue show to shake it", "159:59", "right our tongues she loves it doesn't", "160:01", "know sugar beautiful great yeah it's a", "160:03", "mouth bad innit probably got some weird", "160:05", "red dye it's probably not even really", "160:06", "read probably Brown I think if people", "160:09", "are going to eat sugar though the one", "160:11", "thing they should do is eat it within a", "160:12", "certain time window what's in there", "160:14", "nothing sodium there goes water peppers", "160:17", "salt vinegar and xantham that's like a", "160:20", "gum oh yes Anthem gum spices huh doesn't", "160:23", "seem that bad yeah I don't think his", "160:26", "anthem gums that bad but some of the", "160:27",

"160:50", "probiotic in it for kids do you do you", "160:53", "like limit yeah there it is by Oh kids", "160:56", "we take regular by okay they they take", "161:00", "that stuff 100% probiotic 0%
