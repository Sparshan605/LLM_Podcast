we", "03:41", "need to fix this because you know all", "03:43", "the sexism is bad and obviously if you", "03:46", "disagree with sexism that's of course", "03:48", "bad and I obviously don't you know

I", "04:34", "wouldn't call it a class what would you", "04:35", "call it a meeting", "04:36", "whatever they are yeah some of them were", "04:37", "classes some were you know our day-long", "04:40",

white", "05:35", "woman do you have to go to this I mean", "05:39", "did that are you encouraged to go to", "05:40", "this are you like hey you made it", "05:41", "through like this will have been looking", "05:43", "for you're fine or if you're an Indian", "05:44", "woman even better right is that how it", "05:47", "works", "05:48", "would you still have to go there and", "05:49", "approach your unconscious biases yeah", "05:52", "they say everyone has these unconscious", "05:54", "biases even towards white people do they", "05:57", "have those where they have like black", "05:58",

"yeah I think so", "06:16", "well that's insane that's a redefinition", "06:19", "it's a very recent redefinition of the", "06:21", "term racism but it's very slippery a", "06:24", "very dangerous because you could see it", "06:27", "as you know promoting in fact like", "06:30", "exonerating racism towards other", "06:33", "ethnicities or towards white people or", "06:35", "towards people that you feel like are in", "06:36", "a privet", "06:37", "it's class you get away with it cuz no", "06:39", "big deal because they're the ones who", "06:41", "are racist even if it's not even that", "06:43", "person if it's people who look like them", "06:45", "that have lived for centuries like", "06:47", "somehow or another you are a guilty", "06:48", "person yeah right with your white", "06:51", "privilege so like what would they tell", "06:52", "you when you would go to these do you do", "06:55", "did you like express some discontent or", "06:59", "yeah I my main concern was them saying", "07:04", "50% in the population look who only has", "07:07", "20% and so we're yeah yeah and you know", "07:14", "there were clear reasons at least in my", "07:16", "mind that that's not as simple as", "07:19", "they're making out to be and that you", "07:21", "know there are these some differences", "07:23", "and that could explain some of the", "07:25", "issues that women are facing and so a", "07:27", "lot of these women issues in tech I feel", "07:32", "are actually not really gender issues", "07:34", "they're just you know women on average", "07:37", "are more cooperative for example and so", "07:39", "they may find it harder to you know lean", "07:43", "in in the corporate world like Sheryl", "07:45", "Sandberg is saying but you know there", "07:47", "are men that also feel like that I'm not", "07:49", "very assertive I'm actually pretty shy", "07:51", "and so I feel the same stuff it's not", "07:54", "that you know there's a ton of sexism", "07:56", "it's maybe that male typical behavior is", "07:59", "rewarded mmm just as you know", "08:02", "competitiveness is rewarded in a lot of", "08:04", "corporate world but it's not that we're", "08:07", "just oh you're a woman therefore you're", "08:10", "obviously bad at coding you know no one", "08:11", "is ever saying that right I think there", "08:13", "is absolutely an issue with assertive", "08:16", "women being treated very differently", "08:18", "than a sort of men like an assertive", "08:20", "woman is a bitch", "08:21", "like you don't want to be around them", "08:23", "that's like the the bias and that's a", "08:25", "real issue I think for women that want", "08:27", "to enter into any sort of a competitive", "08:29", "field and you know where a man would be", "08:32", "assertive if a woman does the exact same", "08:34", "thing she's looked down upon", "08:36", "he's looked upon like a problem woman or", "08:38", "someone you don't want to work with", "08:39", "whereas the guy is just ambitious yeah", "08:42", "although some people will twist that and", "08:44", "say that because I mean a lot of it is", "08:47", "just they try to fit their ideology and", "08:48", "they see one data point and they", "08:49", "extrapolate", "08:51", "they see these studies and it's true", "08:53", "that these women are viewed as less", "08:55", "likeable but they are seen as just as", "08:58", "competent and so their performance", "09:01", "reviewed isn't affected really by being", "09:03", "assertive it's just that socially they", "09:06", "may not be as liked as much right but", "09:08", "there's got to be a factor in the way", "09:09", "they behave because yeah for men a", "09:11", "ballbusting successful man is supposed", "09:15", "to be like looked up to like no this is", "09:17", "the guy who's kicking ass in the", "09:19", "corporate world he's doing it right like", "09:20", "you know bob is ruthless but if Jenny's", "09:23", "ruthless like you don't want to be", "09:24", "around her you know it's it's a weird", "09:26", "it's just that's I feel like that if", "09:29", "there is a real bias with many obviously", "09:31", "I don't work in town yeah but I would", "09:33", "assume that that would be a real bias", "09:34", "yeah and I mean I think some of the", "09:36", "solution to that is just allowing people", "09:38", "to be more cooperative and you know", "09:42", "actually so for example at Google you're", "09:45", "really rewarded for owning a particular", "09:47", "project and seeing that one project go", "09:50", "through but if you're someone that is", "09:52", "just you know can really help a lot of", "09:54", "different people and you're not", "09:56", "necessarily the sole owner of any", "09:57", "individual thing but you're you provide", "10:00", "a lot of value to the company that isn't", "10:03", "really seen as positive as someone that", "10:05", "really drove the project alone mmm", "10:09", "that's interesting yeah that seems like", "10:11", "a bad thing for teamwork right is that", "10:14", "just a bad philosophy or something that", "10:17", "got stuck in the way the system works or", "10:19", "I think it's sort of just it's hard to", "10:21", "evaluate if I did you know 10% of my", "10:25", "time on 10 different projects and I", "10:27", "helped them that make sense yeah so", "10:29", "you'd have to essentially trust the", "10:31", "workers instincts and work ethic and", "10:34", "yeah", "10:35", "now the blowback from this has been very", "10:38", "intriguing you know as an outsider like", "10:40", "looking at it first when I first heard", "10:42", "about it you know I thought well this", "10:44", "mean angry man must have written", "10:46", "something saying that women's soccer", "10:48", "tech or they suck at this and you know", "10:50", "and people reacting to this blatant", "10:52", "misogynistic tribe that I are ascribed", "10:56", "that I was was hearing about when I read", "10:59", "it I was so confused because I was like", "11:01", "where's the mean stuff", "11:02", "like where is it", "11:04", "and you also think the other thing that", "11:06", "was really confusing was that some", "11:07", "people were reprinting it without", "11:09", "citation right did that freak you out", "11:12", "like when you're being misrepresented", "11:14", "yeah especially when people would say oh", "11:17", "it was so unscientific because it didn't", "11:19", "have citation right and that was their", "11:20", "entire argument who did it who printed", "11:23", "it without side citations because some", "11:24", "major publications republished it yeah I", "11:28", "think it was Gizmodo or yeah motherboard", "11:31", "or something I why the fuck would they", "11:32", "do that without citations it seems so", "11:35", "unreasonable and so irresponsible I", "11:38", "think a lot of these companies just have", "11:40", "a certain narrative that they're trying", "11:41", "to push yeah and so you even you know", "11:45", "I've tried to talk to a lot of these", "11:47", "reporters and I'll give our along", "11:50", "interviews with some of them and at the", "11:53", "end they'll just write the same sort of", "11:56", "article like oh yeah he's just a", "11:58", "misogynist yeah and so I think even if I", "12:02", "can convince the individual journalist", "12:04", "they are under pressure by their boss to", "12:09", "write a certain type of article yeah", "12:12", "what a weird world we're in right now", "12:14", "when it comes to that because I was", "12:16", "looking for something that could be", "12:20", "could be like evidence of massage the", "12:24", "only thing that I could find this is a", "12:26", "very mild criticism is that you were", "12:27", "saying I believe you used the term", "12:29", "neurotic that women were more likely to", "12:32", "be neurotic Oh neuroticism right yeah", "12:35", "yeah yeah so that's one where a lot of", "12:38", "women will fuck this guy that's it", "12:40", "that's all I mean but what did you base", "12:44", "that on yes there's the psychological", "12:47", "Big Five personality traits mhm and", "12:50", "neuroticism is just one of them right", "12:53", "but that's the actual term that they use", "12:55", "and it's sort of unfortunate that that's", "12:57", "a term yeah yeah it's that one I feel", "13:01", "like maybe could have danced around that", "13:04", "yeah but that's it", "13:06", "I I think it's just I was too much into", "13:09", "the like I've seen the word so often", "13:12", "that I didn't really associate it with", "13:14", "neurotic and all right", "13:16", "yeah well I've seen a bunch of your", "13:19", "conversations I've listened to you talk", "13:22", "to Ben Shapiro and a couple of the folks", "13:23", "and you know your thought process is", "13:26", "very reasonable and very well sorted out", "13:29", "and another thing that I'm not hearing", "13:31", "from anybody is how you wrote a whole", "13:33", "page and a half describing all the", "13:37", "different ways that women could be more", "13:40", "involved in tax or you can encourage", "13:42", "more women into tax like this is not the", "13:44", "work of a misogynist this is the work of", "13:46", "someone who's carefully considering an", "13:48", "issue and looking at it from a very what", "13:51", "what I felt like and correct me if I'm", "13:54", "wrong but that you felt frustrated that", "13:57", "you were looking at something that was", "13:59", "that people the way they were", "14:02", "approaching this wasn't they weren't", "14:03", "looking at it for what it was they had", "14:05", "kind of decided how they were gonna", "14:07", "describe it and how they were going to", "14:11", "deal with it and it wasn't really based", "14:13", "on facts or reality and certainly not on", "14:15", "science and you sort of felt frustrated", "14:18", "by this and you decided to try to", "14:20", "interject with as much of the current", "14:22", "science as you could that could possibly", "14:24", "explain choices not why women are bad at", "14:29", "it not why were they why they shouldn't", "14:31", "be in it which is what I kept reading", "14:32", "but more that why women choose to go", "14:36", "into certain professions what could be", "14:38", "the impediment and what we could do to", "14:41", "maybe encourage more women to do it", "14:42", "instead of doing this sort of blanket", "14:46", "style diversity where you just like oh", "14:48", "we need two of these and we do two of", "14:50", "those right which is what I seem to", "14:53", "think that they were doing is that is", "14:55", "that a good assessment yeah by the way", "14:57", "this will never trend on YouTube you", "14:59", "might get 5 million hits it'll know", "15:01", "that's a real problem too like there's a", "15:03", "lot of censorship when it comes to these", "15:05", "sort of conversations like they would", "15:07", "rather look at me who looks like a", "15:09", "meathead", "15:09", "and look at you and go oh well these", "15:11", "fucking guys are just talking shit about", "15:13", "women for now I mean right I mean do you", "15:16", "feel that definitely and I you'll be", "15:19", "labeled all right now and I've already", "15:21", "been labeled all right", "15:22", "it doesn't matter how many left wing", "15:24", "positions I support I look alright yeah", "15:29", "which is obviously like sexist and short", "15:33", "misogynist racist all that stuff yeah", "15:35", "well but I'm just labeling us because", "15:37", "we're white manners yes a certain label", "15:40", "because that it's yeah it's it's", "15:43", "prejudice yeah I mean it really is but", "15:45", "people don't mind prejudices in that", "15:48", "regard you know they only like pride", "15:49", "they don't they have an issue with", "15:51", "prejudices when it comes to what they", "15:52", "feel like are disenfranchised or you", "15:55", "know marginalized people but white", "15:58", "people fuck them you know yeah you know", "16:00", "that's the thought process right you", "16:02", "can't be racist towards white people so", "16:04", "like what are the most egregious things", "16:05", "like one of the most ridiculous things", "16:06", "they were trying to push when you were", "16:08", "at these classes or meetings so I mean", "16:11", "besides the fact of just certain things", "16:15", "in our hiring process that would favor", "16:17", "certain people which would create", "16:20", "negative stereotypes for people just in", "16:22", "general so I I one thing about", "16:25", "stereotypes that they don't realize is", "16:26", "that you know people will automatically", "16:28", "create stereotypes no matter what and", "16:30", "it's based on their environment so and", "16:33", "we see this with affirmative action too", "16:35", "and academia where if you create a sort", "16:39", "of situation where peoples of population", "16:42", "are performing differently then you'll", "16:45", "automatically create the stereotype that", "16:47", "oh maybe all the Asians are smart and", "16:50", "all of the other minorities aren't as", "16:53", "smart in this College right because you", "16:57", "and you needed a 1,600 to get in if", "16:59", "you're Asian and you need lower", "17:00", "otherwise mm-hmm and so you'll", "17:04", "automatically create that stereotype and", "17:06", "that's negative for everyone because you", "17:07", "know it creates this tension between the", "17:10", "groups and they self segregate because", "17:12", "of that while if you just put everyone", "17:14", "in the same level then they'll just", "17:17", "intermingle and it'll be great and so", "17:21", "you know that has its native", "17:23", "consequences and it may be illegal which", "17:25", "is what I was trying to say in my", "17:28", "document so that aspect I think is bad", "17:31", "but then also you know once you think", "17:36", "that Oh", "17:36", "all of this is because of sexism and", "17:39", "even though we can't really see overt", "17:42", "signs of sexism like oh yeah you're a", "17:44", "woman therefore you're bad and no one is", "17:47", "saying these sexist slurs or anything", "17:49", "then it must be some low-level", "17:51", "bias that we all have and that's why", "17:54", "they're pushing all this unconscious", "17:56", "bias and microaggressions and just", "17:59", "increasing everyone's sensitivity to oh", "18:01", "you said something that could be", "18:04", "interpreted in this one weird way and", "18:07", "that might offend someone somewhere", "18:09", "therefore you should never say anything", "18:11", "and it's really stifling well I think we", "18:16", "would all agree that we would all be", "18:19", "better off if we treated people nicer", "18:22", "yeah if we if we didn't have racism if", "18:26", "we didn't have sexism we just appreciate", "18:28", "people

necessarily accurate yeah I", "26:02", "mean you're kind of like bending the", "26:05", "truth to meet your narrative you know", "26:08", "where instead we should maybe look at", "26:10", "like what are the differences between", "26:11", "men and women but that's the thing like", "26:13", "people don't want to even accept there's", "26:15", "a trend today to not accept biological", "26:19",

was", "27:36", "unfair treatment and harassment and then", "27:38", "one in 12 men felt like there was you", "27:42", "know unwanted sexual attention so you", "27:44", "know they completely disregard the other", "27:46", "side of the narrative that you know it's", "27:49", "not really a gender issue that there's", "27:51", "just unfair treatment in general you", "27:53", "know mmm well I think men are gross I", "27:56", "would want to work with them in an", "27:58", "office I mean if I was a woman I would", "28:00", "think they would be the worst place to", "28:01", "work as an office with men especially if", "28:03", "I was attractive and I was just around a", "28:05", "bunch of goons or staring at my butt and", "28:06", "just saying stupid shit men are gross I", "28:09", "mean I think like is an issue with men", "28:12", "and women working together because a lot", "28:13", "of men are gross you know I mean it's", "28:16", "not all of us obviously but I mean that", "28:17", "just if I want to be honest about it I", "28:20", "would say that man I think women", "28:22", "probably have to deal with a lot of shit", "28:23", "but is that the reason why only 20% of", "28:28", "them are intact because that's not the", "28:29", "case with all jobs we really work", "28:32", "together and I think men are gross", "28:33", "across the board they're not just gross", "28:36", "in tech I mean they're probably gross", "28:38", "like what are jobs where women are", "28:40", "disproportionately represented like on", "28:42", "the other side like is it like health", "28:44", "so nursing veterinarians schools so a", "28:50", "lot of things that deal with people or", "28:51", "animals in this case yeah well I bet", "28:54", "they deal with gross dudes there too but", "28:58", "but that doesn't stop them from being", "29:00", "hired at a disproportionately favorable", "29:02", "number in percentage yeah it's um we got", "29:06", "a look a being I think collectively", "29:08", "here's one good thing there's not a good", "29:10", "thing about google cuz I don't want to", "29:11", "trash on Google and the good thing about", "29:12", "tech companies in general I feel like we", "29:16", "are in a way better position that tech", "29:19", "companies are leaning way left I think", "29:22", "we're in a way better position socially", "29:24", "that tech companies are being extremely", "29:27", "concerned about diversity because you", "29:29", "just don't feel that and a lot of", "29:31", "companies where they're about the hard", "29:32", "line they're about the bottom line", "29:34", "making money kicking ass taking names", "29:36", "pushing the company ahead and they're", "29:39", "there they're about you know infinite", "29:41", "growth this is not what I see from tech", "29:44", "companies what I see tech companies this", "29:45", "is extreme caution when it comes to", "29:48", "social issues and in this extreme desire", "29:50", "to be thought of as being very diverse", "29:53", "very fair very liberal I think that's", "29:57", "good I really do I think it balances it", "29:59", "out and I also think when I think at", "30:02", "least about the smartest people in the", "30:03", "world or the the most innovative people", "30:06", "in the world today I almost always think", "30:08", "about tack because I think about like", "30:10", "well you look if you looked at the human", "30:11", "organism you look at the human organism", "30:15", "the human species as a whole and if you", "30:18", "looked at like what does it do that's", "30:19", "most impressive well what it does is his", "30:22", "constant innovation or in this constant", "30:24", "desire to make things more and more", "30:26", "efficient faster more capable that", "30:29", "that's a big part of that is tech so the", "30:32", "people that are they like in a lot of", "30:33", "ways at least the most technically", "30:35", "creative those people are oftentimes", "30:38", "very left-wing", "30:39", "and very liberal so I like the fact that", "30:41", "Google has this as a thought process I", "30:44", "just wish that it was unbiased in its", "30:50", "determinations when it comes to biases", "30:52", "right that makes sense yes right I agree", "30:55", "that you know being progressive isn't", "30:57", "necessarily a bad thing right", "30:58", "and you know I it is great that Google", "31:03", "has this don't be evil motto and you", "31:05", "know they've decided oh yeah we get a", "31:07", "ton of ad revenue therefore we can do a", "31:09", "ton of random stuff that's good for the", "31:12", "world but you know I think unfortunately", "31:14", "their political bias has created yeah", "31:18", "they've they haven't forgotten there", "31:20", "don't be evil motto", "31:21", "it's just that don't be evil has turned", "31:24", "into just don't disagree with us and", "31:26", "what our ideology says they got sloppy", "31:30", "yeah yeah well they're just a little off", "31:34", "but they're going the right way you know", "31:37", "and look it's very difficult to fucking", "31:39", "I mean how could you run a giant company", "31:42", "like that and be just totally cool and", "31:44", "above ground and have it all worked out", "31:47", "I mean right it just doesn't happen you", "31:50", "know and especially when you have all", "31:51", "these internal influences like you're", "31:54", "talking with these activists that work", "31:55", "that have they have a vested interest in", "31:58", "proving that there's racism there's a", "32:00", "vested interest like when you go looking", "32:02", "for you know if you have a hammer", "32:05", "everything becomes an end right right if", "32:07", "you're a person who's the type of person", "32:09", "that's looking for racism everywhere", "32:10", "fuck man you're gonna find it in all", "32:12", "these weird places like that don't even", "32:14", "make sense", "32:14", "like these hidden unconscious biases", "32:17", "where you have to examine yourself don't", "32:19", "just look at overt actions and see", "32:22", "whether or not those actions are racism", "32:23", "yep racist you have to actually examine", "32:25", "all your thoughts and try to find racist", "32:28", "thoughts and because they are in there", "32:30", "whether you want to believe it or not", "32:31", "like right oh jesus this is a damn ghost", "32:33", "hunt you know this is a witch hunt", "32:35", "mm-hmm it's like it's it's not like", "32:39", "again even though I'm a white man I", "32:42", "really feel like it's leaning better", "32:44", "that we're shitting on white men then", "32:47", "you know if it was the other way if we", "32:49", "were shitting on minorities yeah I mean", "32:52", "it would be very disturbing if an", "32:53", "enormous company like Google was going", "32:55", "oh let's just let's just be honest Porto", "32:57", "Ricans are lazy you know I would whoa", "32:59", "but if a company comes along like", "33:02", "gluings like we know white you can't be", "33:04", "racist towards white people like okay at", "33:07", "least we can work here we could talk you", "33:08", "can talk", "33:09", "this is your saying something fuckin", "33:11", "crazy racist I know you don't think it's", "33:13", "crazy and racist because you're trying", "33:14", "so hard to not be racist towards", "33:16", "minorities that you're looking at what's", "33:18", "a temporary majority I mean why people", "33:20", "only a majority for another decade right", "33:22", "you know I hope it evens out but I I", "33:27", "feel like in defense of Google it's", "33:30", "better to be leaning in correctly in", "33:33", "that direction than to go the other way", "33:35", "yeah I mean I think it's fine to have a", "33:38", "leaning it's just you need to not be", "33:40", "blind to the other side and I think that", "33:42", "that's what's happening right now yeah", "33:44", "where you know they're completely", "33:46", "shutting down the conversation and", "33:48", "they're really making certain employees", "33:51", "feel completely alienated well yeah if", "33:54", "it seems like you can't obviously you", "33:56", "tried to talk about it and you were", "33:58", "fired yeah you know I mean you were you", "34:00", "were shamed for a little while and then", "34:02", "it went public and then you were fired", "34:03", "now why did did they do it did they send", "34:07", "it publicly because they knew that", "34:08", "people would have a negative reaction", "34:09", "towards it that's what I think yeah I", "34:11", "don't know who did it it was probably", "34:13", "the people that were tweeting about it", "34:15", "and saying that I was just a misogynist", "34:17", "Nazi person and I don't not see yeah I", "34:20", "used white supremacists he was used yeah", "34:24", "they just keep escalating and at some", "34:26", "point I don't really know it'll happen", "34:28", "you know I mean white supremacist is now", "34:30", "being used for a lot of things you're a", "34:32", "white supremacist somehow Wow and at", "34:37", "some point people will just see no these", "34:39", "people aren't actually that and you know", "34:41", "they've just created a bubble of words", "34:44", "that they say and it just keeps getting", "34:46", "more and more extreme and at some point", "34:49", "it'll just shatter like an economic", "34:52", "bubble but I but that's very dangerous", "34:54", "because it opens a door to competition", "34:56", "to Google like someone who's more", "34:58", "rational and I think that's unfortunate", "35:00", "for Google to like to be supporting", "35:02", "these ridiculous ideas I got read this", "35:05", "one article where this woman was calling", "35:06", "you a misogynist and it was like she was", "35:10", "being really brutal you know like though", "35:12", "but it was it was a total false", "35:14", "narrative because I was listening I was", "35:17", "reading it and I was trying to like I'd", "35:20", "read your memo so I read your memo", "35:23", "and then I read this article about your", "35:24", "memo I'm like this is

misogynist of the", "35:37", "world like James are the the reason why", "35:39", "women can't excel in tack yeah I think", "35:43", "part of it is that there's just an", "35:44", "asymmetry so there's no punishment for", "35:46", "writing this really angry letter that", "35:50", "says how a misogynist I am yeah even", "35:52", "though you know that's negative to me", "35:55", "and anyone else that

afraid to point out", "79:11", "issues in the workplace right and you", "79:15", "just said with the lawsuit like it's", "79:16", "absolutely happening yeah I mean we've", "79:22", "we filed a claim with the NLRB which is", "79:24", "the National Labor Relations Board and", "79:27", "so they usually work with unions and you", "79:30", "know it's often employers that try to", "79:32", "break up unions and fire people for", "79:34", "joining unions and that's illegal and", "79:37", "you know a lot of this what I was doing", "79:39", "was a conservative effort between", "79:42", "multiple people that", "79:43", "you know trying to improve the workplace", "79:45", "right and actually you know whistle blow", "79:49", "on some of the illegal practices did you", "79:52", "save emails where people were shaming", "79:54", "people for being white or shaming people", "79:57", "for having implicit bias because they", "79:59", "were white or harassing people for yet a", "80:02", "lot of people have been doing this like", "80:05", "there's some underground efforts within", "80:08", "Google to at least document some of this", "80:11", "because you know while they may not be", "80:14", "the majority they they're sort of a", "80:17", "silent coalition within Google that's", "80:20", "sort of upset about a lot of this oh", "80:22", "that's interesting so there are some", "80:25", "conservative people that work at Google", "80:26", "yeah there's there's definitely more", "80:29", "than zero more than zero", "80:31", "is it like 20% like the amount that are", "80:33", "represented like women representing the", "80:36", "company so it may be that or even lower", "80:40", "I think there's a lot of libertarians so", "80:43", "that would be the main counter - right", "80:45", "the extreme left but and then like sort", "80:50", "of like what the main retribution is", "80:52", "against people are the social", "80:54", "conservatives and they feel completely", "80:57", "alienated mmm so it's really unfortunate", "81:01", "for them but I yeah there's at least", "81:07", "hundreds of them now when you say like", "81:09", "social conservatives like what what do", "81:12", "you how do you classify that like what", "81:15", "would I mean I guess people that believe", "81:19", "in traditional values and homophobes say", "81:23", "it so I think this is a lot of what's", "81:29", "happening - on where people just assume", "81:32", "okay because you believe say in", "81:34", "traditional values and you think that", "81:37", "your marriage is an important thing and", "81:39", "you know I think that there is evidence", "81:41", "that you know bringing up people in a", "81:45", "two-parent household whether or not it's", "81:47", "you know the same sex or different sex", "81:49", "that is important for children and that", "81:52", "there's a huge disparity and outcome of", "81:54", "people with only one parent versus two", "81:57", "so there is something to be said about", "81:59", "marriage and you know having cultural", "82:02", "norms that support that but so you know", "82:07", "just completely alienating that side of", "82:10", "the argument is really negative and", "82:12", "that's hurt our society in general I", "82:14", "think yeah well I think anytime you", "82:18", "silence discussion based on your own", "82:23", "personal ideas of what should and", "82:26", "shouldn't be debated I think it becomes", "82:29", "an issue I mean you can disagree with", "82:31", "someone and it's a very complicated", "82:34", "issue when it comes to whether or not to", "82:37", "parents or more beneficial to a child", "82:40", "than one because obviously there's a lot", "82:43", "of reasons why people break up yeah you", "82:45", "know you don't want to encourage people", "82:46", "to be in toxic relationships and then", "82:48", "show the child that you know this is a", "82:51", "the framework for a loving relationship", "82:52",

"83:00", "definitely a touchy subject it's very", "83:02", "personal one yeah so I I don't know", "83:04", "personally how to address that but I", "83:07", "think it's at least something that we", "83:10", "should be cognizant of has anybody said", "83:13", "when you know these white people are", "83:15", "being shamed in this you know as anybody", "83:17", "ever stepped up and say hey this is", "83:18", "racist they might have but never in a", "83:22", "public forum that I ever but publicly", "83:25", "white people have been criticized right", "83:28", "and you know they there's all these", "83:30", "negative stereotypes of men and white", "83:32", "people and you know those gender", "83:35", "stereotypes are fine but mmm and you", "83:39", "know the whole idea of it you know I'm", "83:41", "only here because of my white male", "83:43", "privilege", "83:44", "therefore I'm somehow a worse programmer", "83:46", "than all the other non-white non males", "83:49", "is that implied or is it stated I it's", "83:52", "implied that you know they get it easier", "83:55", "in life and in the interview process and", "83:57", "my evaluations yeah white and maybe", "84:00", "Asian males so how's it implied though", "84:02", "it can you give me an example", "84:03", "and they'll say explicitly the gist yes", "84:07", "these these groups of people are", "84:09",

they're better", "84:19", "evaluated and these are worse and yet", "84:23", "they like they often just see whatever", "84:26", "data that they want you know like that", "84:28", "case before where they just pulled out", "84:30", "the female side without seeing that all", "84:33", "the male side was pretty much the same", "84:34", "mm-hmm and it's crazy and bate you even", "84:39", "see it in some of their internal studies", "84:40", "where you know they were trying to show", "84:42", "how grace deserves sexist google was and", "84:46", "how worse women have it so they were", "84:48",

mean", "85:06", "that their work is more scrutinized but", "85:09", "if they got fewer comments then they", "85:11", "were just ignored and so yeah there's no", "85:13", "way out of it yeah yeah any result would", "85:17", "show that women are being discriminated", "85:20", "yeah just coming against somehow Wow man", "85:25", "I'm glad I don't work where you worked", "85:28", "are you happy to be

the", "86:24", "top wit which may not be you know very", "86:28", "easy to change things so I Google is", "86:32", "definitely more of the former where", "86:35", "there is a lot of chaos and

at this whole China thing", "90:29", "because essentially she was saying they", "90:30", "have to", "90:31", "agree to censorship the Chinese", "90:33", "censorship and that the only alternative", "90:34", "is to let China steal all of what", "90:38", "Google's doing and make a fake google do", "90:40", "because that's what they were doing", "90:42", "apparently yeah to make sure that they", "90:44", "they didn't allow that and then to do", "90:46", "that they had to have certain things", "90:48", "like Tiananmen Square he couldn't search", "90:49", "for that I was like a lot of weird shit", "90:52", "that they would have to censor any you", "90:54", "know dissent of the government and you", "90:56", "know it's very slippery right I mean", "91:00", "like yeah you're anti diverse or

you", "124:01", "get a lot of like really fragile or", "124:02", "really poorly thought-out ideas and as", "124:06", "long as you can hit the nerve of enough", "124:08", "retards you can get those

but women do experience a", "137:01", "on a sexism and again it's because like", "137:03", "I said men are gross you know this is a", "137:05", "lot of gross men and men working in", "137:08", "close

not", "137:36", "being honest about that we do just as", "137:38", "much of a disservice yeah although I", "137:41", "mean I would say that you know there are", "137:43", "men that are just as

that fit that stereotype or", "137:57", "don't fit the typical male stereotype", "137:59", "because you know there's negative", "138:01", "consequences on both sides for not being", "138:04",

him", "138:23", "some money just shut him up do you want", "138:26", "to go through with a lawsuit like what", "138:27", "if they came to you with a settlement", "138:28", "would you just take it and shut your", "138:30", "mouth I really want somehow for them to", "138:33", "address it but I I don't know how to do", "138:36", "that well even if they if you lose in", "138:39", "court will they address it they'll", "138:40", "probably say you know although we", "138:42", "support the court we disagree with the", "138:43", "rulings and we still support gender", "138:45", "equality and yeah I mean I think part of", "138:50", "it is that there's currently an", "138:51", "asymmetry so maybe Google is acting in", "138:53", "their best interest to act the way that", "138:56", "they are because they think that you", "138:58", "know there's all these activists that", "139:00", "are trying to attack Google that only if", "139:03", "they don't fit this certain party are", "139:05", "there a lot of activists that are", "139:06", "attacking Google in that regard yeah and", "139:08", "you know we even see that there's now a", "139:11", "potential class action lawsuit against", "139:14",

claim that it's the same job", "139:38", "although at least when Google was doing", "139:41", "their own internal analysis which", "139:42", "they've been doing for years they show", "139:45", "that there's no disparity once you", "139:47", "control for a perform for performance", "139:49", "and so it it's really unclear and but", "139:56", "you control for performance performance", "139:58", "tends to favor males maybe if if that's", "140:01", "what they're showing that there is some", "140:03", "sort of gender disparity if you just", "140:05", "look at aggregate look at this one in", "140:07", "100 million chance alleged gender pay", "140:10", "gap at Google is random says class", "140:13", "action lawyer oh Jesus class action", "140:16", "lawyer says that in the articles

way for them to say", "140:28", "whether or not it's based on the", "140:30", "performance look what they're saying", "140:32", "here you know notice is seeking women", "140:37", "currently or

"141:07", "a pretty high level of dissatisfaction", "141:08", "says James Feinberg no it's not no these", "141:12", "fuckin thousands of people have worked", "141:14", "there and a couple dozen came forward", "141:16", "that's not a high level of satisfaction", "141:18", "how many people have been employed at", "141:20", "Google that are no longer employed it's", "141:22", "probably tens of thousands right yeah", "141:26", "there's 70,000 people working there", "141:28", "so for this guy to say that's a pretty", "141:30", "high level of dissatisfaction when", "141:33", "several dozen let's say three dozen", "141:36", "let's go crazy let's say it's forty", "141:38", "people let's get nuts that's fuckin", "141:40", "nobody man", "141:41", "yeah hey Oh seventy women it's our", "141:44", "biggest bird fum", "141:46", "but wait a minute heard from that", "141:48", "doesn't that you mean they might not", "141:49", "even make sense that might not be a case", "141:52", "for four people for that's not a lot you", "141:59", "fuck the classics I mean that's just", "142:02", "this is this is a fuckin ambulance", "142:05", "chaser chaser right I mean I'm not", "142:08", "saying he's wrong I'm not saying there's", "142:10", "not sexual discrimination but I'm saying", "142:12", "like this is articles or sneaky as fuck", "142:14", "for people you got four people and I", "142:16", "don't know how an individual would know", "142:18", "whether or not they're paid differently", "142:21", "just based on their sex right because", "142:23", "there's so many variables to play so you", "142:25", "really have to look at the system as a", "142:28", "whole because I mean there definitely", "142:30", "some men that are paid less than the", "142:32", "women too when you can perform examples", "142:34", "like that the problem is when you", "142:36", "control for performance if it turns out", "142:38", "that men are being paid more then you", "142:40", "have to figure out some sort of a way to", "142:41", "justify that or you know like if men are", "142:45", "being paid more when you control for", "142:47", "performance what is it that's causing", "142:50", "the men to be paid more why they", "142:52", "performing better like is it the", "142:53", "environment they feel more comfortable", "142:55", "is it lack of suppression that the women", "142:58", "experience like yeah so I guess when you", "143:00", "look at the nationwide gender gap in pay", "143:04", "we're you know even Obama has said 77", "143:06", "cents per dollar is too little yeah but", "143:09",

"143:17", "completely different jobs different", "143:18", "choices for people don't know okay let's", "143:21", "just break that down real quick this", "143:22", "this thing because people repeated ad", "143:24", "nauseam and it's just not true the", "143:26", "gender pay gap of 77 cents to a dollar", "143:29", "that a male makes is based on the", "143:32", "choices that people make as far as like", "143:34", "what they do for a living it's based on", "143:36", "the amount of hours that they work men", "143:38", "tend to work longer hours", "143:40", "and especially if they get pregnant all", "143:42", "those things are factored in that's", "143:44", "where you get 77 cents on average for", "143:48", "the dollar that the male makes what it", "143:49", "implies and this is where it's", "143:51", "disingenuous is it two people working", "143:53", "side-by-side doing the same job and the", "143:55", "males getting 77 more a dollar for the", "143:58", "woman 77 cents that's not what the", "144:01", "gender pay gap actually means and if", "144:04", "Google is actually if someone is saying", "144:07", "if there's a lawsuit that's saying that", "144:09", "a man and a woman are doing the exact", "144:11", "same job with the exact same performance", "144:14", "and the woman is only getting 77 cents", "144:16", "on the dollar then you got a real issue", "144:18", "right yeah and so it's often or that you", "144:24", "know there's different hours worked and", "144:26", "it doesn't even have to be that you know", "144:28", "they work twice as many or 30% more it's", "144:32", "sometimes if you just work you know", "144:35", "forty four hours a week versus thirty", "144:37", "four hours or something mm-hmm then", "144:39", "there's a huge pay disparity yeah and",

the people", "149:04", "calling you a misogynist it was very", "149:06", "weird and CEO of YouTube saying it hurt", "149:09", "her life yeah I mean I thought that you", "149:17", "know the first the

"149:44", "whatever the titles of the articles that", "149:46", "are criticizing you and just just", "149:49", "accepted as gospel you know yeah I've", "149:52", "gotten a lot of responses that were just", "149:54", "oh yeah I saw on Facebook you know some", "149:56", "sexist memo and you know it was only", "150:00", "after they saw that so many times and", "150:01", "they decided to read it that

happen", "150:31", "I I don't know I think that you know", "150:36", "people now are aware of this a lot more", "150:38", "and there may be platforms that emerge", "150:41", "that are sort of you know all tech is", "150:44", "what they're calling it just alternative", "150:45", "technology that's more open to just free", "150:48", "speech but unfortunately they're", "150:52", "currently just being

the thing it's just like", "151:06", "they're they're taking everyone's word", "151:08", "for everything yeah it's very odd time", "151:11", "but there's enough people discussing it", "151:14", "you know and I think you're the response", "151:17", "to your memo has been it's been very", "151:21", "enlightening for some people from from a", "151:24", "sort of a psychological standpoint like", "151:26", "what what are the reactions that people", "151:28", "have and why do they have these", "151:29", "reactions and what is it was it say", "151:31", "about us as human beings that this is", "151:33", "such a taboo subject that we can't even", "151:35", "address the the very real differences", "151:38", "that we have as unique individuals you", "151:41", "know hmm", "151:42", "yeah I'm at least happy that it didn't", "151:45", "happen during college season because", "151:48", "then there'd be like protests and people", "151:50", "burning my effigy years I think so I", "151:52", "think it would have been a much more", "151:54", "negative if it was during the school", "151:56", "year Wow and they would demand that", "151:59", "their school you know double down on", "152:02", "diversity and just all these things but", "152:06", "yeah a lot of virtue signaling going on", "152:08", "yeah I it's at least it's nice to see", "152:13", "that some of the colleges have been", "152:15", "standing up for an art against it and", "152:18", "you know saying no you can't really just", "152:21", "tell us what to do and we believe in you", "152:24", "know knowledge and actually seeking the", "152:27", "truth and not just criticizing people", "152:30", "based", "152:30", "their political ideologies yeah it's a", "152:34", "long slog my friend there's a lot of", "152:37", "walking and talking going on but uh I", "152:39", "think we'll be fine I hope I hope we'll", "152:42", "be fine", "152:42", "if we don't go to war with North Korea", "152:44", "or get smashed by a hundred fuckin", "152:46", "hurricanes in a row but I think we", "152:50", "should just what's matter", "152:52", "I've got a tweet that you're badass in", "152:55", "chess Oh a chess master yeah I've played", "152:58", "a lot of chess yeah", "153:00", "no that was my life for a few years he", "153:05", "played chess in your head yeah wow", "153:06", "that's fascinating I used to play chess", "153:09", "in my head against like four different", "153:11", "people so like blindfolded whoa dude I", "153:15", "knew this kid who's a chess master and a", "153:19", "pool hall that I used to go to and he", "153:21", "used to play with this ex-con and the", "153:22", "ex-con learned how to do chess in prison", "153:25", "in his head with no pieces and his kid", "153:28", "would just sit there and play chess back", "153:30", "and forth of each other like what are", "153:32", "you guys doing how how do you know where", "153:35", "that board is you could play it", "153:37", "blindfolded with four people in your", "153:39", "head yeah wow that's intense man how'd", "153:42", "you learn how to do that just repetition", "153:44", "over time yeah doing it a lot and just", "153:47", "obsessing over it and this is actually", "153:50", "one of the differences and average", "153:52", "between men and women is there are more", "153:54", "men that are just become obsessed with", "153:56", "these systems mmm and so you know Magic", "153:59", "the Gathering the card game was also", "154:01", "something that became super obsessed", "154:02", "with and so the way that people approach", "154:06", "computers to is different where you know", "154:08", "some are a lot of boys just approach the", "154:11", "computer as a toy and they become", "154:12", "obsessed with tinkering with the", "154:14", "computer while a lot of girls see it as", "154:17", "a tool for improving the world and so", "154:21", "they may not be interested in the", "154:23", "computer as an end to itself mm-hmm and", "154:27", "so a lot of the education programs to", "154:30", "get more women into tech are actually", "154:32", "addressing that but it's unclear because", "154:36", "like so much of coding is just you know", "154:40", "writing server code and this server is", "154:43", "going to talk to this", "154:44", "which is talking to that server and it's", "154:46", "totally unconnected to actual people and", "154:49", "but you know that's why we actually see", "154:52", "more women and front-end and user", "154:54", "experience engineering positions because", "154:58", "it's more interactive with people what", "155:01", "are the numbers with women in chess yeah", "155:03", "there aren't that many and it's", "155:05", "unfortunate is it unfortunate because", "155:09", "it's just it is yeah yeah I don't play", "155:12", "chess is that unfortunate so why is it", "155:16", "unfortunate that women are", "155:17", "underrepresented well just for the cases", "155:20", "of maybe they feel like a minority and", "155:23", "yet right and a lot of the mistreatment", "155:29", "of women is not you know ill intention", "155:32", "men that want to be sexist against men", "155:34", "it's just I and I felt this a lot you", "155:37", "know everyone wants a girl to play chess", "155:40", "or play Magic the Gathering you know", "155:43", "that that's their ideal girlfriend right", "155:46", "right so and but they're all nerdy guys", "155:50", "or generally and they don't have as good", "155:52", "social skills as the average population", "155:54", "and you know they're pretty similar to", "155:56", "the people playing or writing code so", "155:59", "it's a similar situation so they just", "156:02", "don't know how to interact with women", "156:03", "and that causes some problems mmm", "156:07", "but so it's not the just overt sexism", "156:13", "against women it's more just we don't", "156:16", "really know how to interact with women", "156:18", "we just you know we're obsessed with", "156:20", "chess or whatever and we just like", "156:23", "talking about chess and there a lot of", "156:26", "women that just aren't as obsessed with", "156:29", "these sort of systems so but I mean", "156:34", "that's not a bad thing right it just is", "156:37", "what it is yeah I mean I'm sure there's", "156:39", "a bunch of fashion things and a status", "156:43", "thing except aesthetic things and design", "156:45", "things that women are really into that a", "156:47", "lot of men don't give a fuck about yeah", "156:49", "it's not a terrible thing that men", "156:51", "aren't into design yeah there's not more", "156:53", "men involved in interior design it's not", "156:55", "terrible", "156:56", "thing and that's sort of one of the", "156:58", "unfortunate things too is that there's", "157:00", "so much fighting to get more women into", "157:03", "tech but there's no fighting to get more", "157:06", "men into nursing right yeah and you know", "157:08", "these more female dominated careers do", "157:12", "you think that's also because of the", "157:13", "financial rewards of tech are so extreme", "157:15", "in comparison like nursing is a pretty", "157:18", "capped salary whereas if you can climb", "157:21", "the corporate ladder as a you know a CEO", "157:24", "of some sort of a tech company the", "157:25", "rewards are substantial yet I I think", "157:29", "inevitably there will be more men", "157:31", "attracted to high-paying jobs simply", "157:34", "because they fight for status and money", "157:36", "is how you gain status often so that's", "157:40", "partly why they see tech as a target but", "157:43", "it's not as if nursing is a bad job", "157:45", "right that gets paid well and there are", "157:48", "many people that you know go to college", "157:50", "for pre-med and drop out like 90 percent", "157:53", "of people that start as pre-med drop out", "157:55", "and the men feel like they can't enter", "157:59", "nursing because that's too feminine", "158:00", "mm-hmm and there's huge biases against", "158:03", "men becoming feminine like you know men", "158:06", "can't wear dresses but girls can be", "158:08", "openly tomboyish right right so there's", "158:13", "unfortunately some asymmetries in our", "158:16", "culture and there's reasons for it you", "158:20", "know if a guy is too feminine then he", "158:23",

and", "158:50", "gender norms are just put behind those", "158:54", "two gender roles yeah I think there's a", "158:58", "lot of evidence to support that and I", "158:59", "think that was essentially
