first one in the", "11:02", "budget they had that's why you know guys", "11:05", "like you or Kevin Shapiro I was like why", "11:07", "is the Rogen host why isn't Kevin J like", "11:09", "big guys that people know honestly", "11:11", "because they had zero dollars what's", "11:13", "also the", "11:14", "Hosting thing I couldn't a hosted it", "11:16", "because I'm a commentator for the yeah",

silly I thought my favorite", "12:00", "thing I tweeted this I was watching you", "12:02", "do a combat inning one of the fights I", "12:04", "love when you call out an entire group", "12:06", "of twenty thousand people for booing", "12:08", "because I I get mad like we're just", "12:11", "drunk", "12:11", "yeah the bottom line is that I", "12:14", "understand that they didn't like the", "12:15", "decision that makes sense but once the", "12:17", "dude is talking when they're", "12:18", "interviewing the dude booing him all he", "12:21", "did was like Aaron Simpson versus Tom", "12:23", "Laurel yeah that was the last one like", "12:25", "you can't boo Aaron Simpson the guy", "12:27", "fought his ass off he got hurt really", "12:29", "bad the first round and came back and", "12:32", "won the second and the third and it was", "12:33", "a really gutty performance man and it", "12:37", "had mad endurance and even in the third", "12:39", "round he outpaced Tom Lawlor I mean was", "12:41", "just a great fight overall great fight", "12:44", "and I don't know how anybody couldn't", "12:45", "enjoyed it I mean I think in situations", "12:48", "like that I hate close decisions because", "12:51", "close decisions like that man it could", "12:53", "have gone either way and so the fight", "12:56", "really took place everybody saw what", "12:59", "happened and to decide that one guy", "13:01", "wanted or another guy wanted when it's", "13:03", "that close I would much rather have a", "13:05", "draw I think that fight could have", "13:07", "easily been a draw you know a lot of", "13:09", "people thought that Tom Lawlor one which", "13:11", "I definitely think he won the first", "13:13", "round but I think and Simpsons on the", "13:15", "second and third although not in as", "13:18", "large a margin second very slight in the", "13:21", "third a little bit", "13:22", "more I think if you looked at it on", "13:24", "paper you could say well maybe you could", "13:25", "give the first round ten eight but the", "13:28", "bottom line is forget about all that the", "13:30", "bottom line is it was a great fight yeah", "13:33", "the guy should feel like a loser like", "13:34", "there's no way Tom Wallisch should feel", "13:36", "like a loser after that fight and", "13:37", "there's no way Aaron Simpson should've", "13:39", "got booed oh yeah why", "13:41", "any time I've been at a live fight or or", "13:43", "you hear the people I don't get mad but", "13:45", "I love when people start going you know", "13:47", "start yelling stand them up when they've", "13:49", "been on the ground for maybe thirty five", "13:51", "seconds yeah it's the war advisory or if", "13:54", "guys feel out each other like I'm okay", "13:56", "with an X bar to me a nice bar MMA is my", "13:59", "golf", "14:00", "I don't spar to really try to tell", "14:02", "everybody I enjoy the work out of it but", "14:04", "even you know you have to feel out a guy", "14:06", "you don't just go go and then start", "14:08", "let's start you know people expect like", "14:10", "hockey fights sometimes where it just", "14:12", "erupts immediately they walk out they go", "14:14", "toe-to-toe in start well I think it's", "14:17", "just that the one of the action is great", "14:18", "it's so exciting that people want to", "14:20", "keep that part going and then when it", "14:23", "goes to the ground the uneducated fans", "14:25", "if they don't know what's going on they", "14:27", "they get upset but I promise the", "14:29", "referees in small towns like when we go", "14:31", "to Memphis I don't say small towns", "14:33", "Memphis is in a small town but I go", "14:34", "outside of Vegas a lot of times they use", "14:36", "local referees and these guys they're", "14:39", "too busy they get involved the action", "14:41", "too much you know fight guys bike guys", "14:43", "I'm while they're fighting you don't", "14:45", "like guys in the guard he's working as", "14:46", "guards trying for an armbar trap or", "14:48", "something I'm gonna stand you up I'm", "14:49", "standing up like what the fuck you", "14:51", "talking about you're staying love this", "14:52", "guy's are fine I don't think most a part", "14:53", "of fighting I don't think most people", "14:54", "realize the difficulty is I mean just", "14:57", "have somebody your size if not a little", "14:59", "bit bigger laying on top of you and then", "15:01", "stand up from that position just letting", "15:04", "that person just with their weight", "15:05", "Center how hard it is just to stand up", "15:07", "what do you mean like if I find one if", "15:10", "I'm on my back here on top of me and I", "15:12", "and I scramble and I get it that we both", "15:14", "we stand up together that's a huge feat", "15:16", "in it yeah it is you know it may be baby", "15:19", "not that that not gonna be that the only", "15:21", "way you should get up is if you got off", "15:23", "it shouldn't be the referee stands you", "15:25", "up I hate all that shit I've always said", "15:27", "that if if someone like Brock Lesnar can", "15:29", "take you down and molest you for five", "15:31", "minutes yeah then that's tough shit", "15:32", "tough shit he's got you on your back you", "15:35", "got", "15:35", "anyway to get back on TV and if you", "15:37", "can't it's five minutes of him punching", "15:39", "you in the face", "15:40", "yeah it's life and if your technique to", "15:42", "avoid that is to turn and run in circles", "15:44", "so we can't tackle you didn't do yeah", "15:47", "that's it yeah it is whatever it's not", "15:50", "and believe me that's gonna you what's", "15:53", "gonna decide your career is gonna be", "15:56", "fans and with a fans like your style", "15:58", "whether or not you sell tickets whether", "16:00", "or not you know you optimize your", "16:02", "potential as a mixed martial artist and", "16:04", "the fans are gonna let you know
