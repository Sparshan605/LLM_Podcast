like bossing people around or", "13:34", "one of his bits was like having a", "13:37", "whistle and directing traffic I mean", "13:39", "really adolescent like but for some", "13:41", "reason I was really attracted to him and", "13:44", "like I wanted to be him anybody who was", "13:47", "like extroverted or something that I", "13:50", "wanted that's I was attracted to that", "13:52", "right so

phrases from commercials or snippets", "14:07", "of conversation that I had heard and I", "14:09", "went up and I started reading them and", "14:11", "then I would improvise a little bit and", "14:14", "I'd be like waxy buildup or whatever I'm", "14:16", "just repeating just letting it all", "14:18", "filter through and come out my mouth for", "14:21", "five minutes of whatever the open

commitment", "14:32", "level was so high that the fact that it", "14:34", "didn't make any sense just caused", "14:37", "laughter right right right right", "14:39", "well that works sometimes with just even", "14:42", "with comics you know absolutely there's", "14:44", "a lot of people that are just really odd", "14:47", "and if you saw them you would get it but", "14:50", "if you saw what they wrote on paper or", "14:53", "what they said just written down on", "14:55", "paper you would be like what that", "14:56", "doesn't make any sense yeah well I", "14:58", "thought you were gonna say which is a", "14:59", "similar point that that it comes in the", "15:02", "pause and after what they're saying even", "15:04", "if it doesn't make any sense but you're", "15:05", "saying sometimes people write things and", "15:07", "it makes its own sense when you hear", "15:09", "them yeah yeah yeah I mean but it's also", "15:12", "just about being full yes yes yes yeah", "15:16", "and those pauses yeah that gives you", "15:18", "especially something's really absurd", "15:19", "gives you that opportunity to go", "15:22", "yeah you don't want to just hammer them", "15:24", "over the head with it so you just", "15:27", "started doing that and how did it lead", "15:29", "to actual stand up stand up it was a", "15:33", "really fun time in San Francisco because", "15:34", "the comedy clubs were closing so a lot", "15:37", "of comics were coming to these Open Mic", "15:38", "poetry rooms and one of my favorite", "15:40", "rooms was in this bar and also I was", "15:42", "from the

"they have a real arts scene and it was", "15:53", "the first time that I had seen like a", "15:54", "real counterculture and people that", "15:56", "would hang out in coffee shops and a lot", "15:58", "of young people that looked like I did", "16:00", "so I'd go to bars for this open mic and", "16:03", "there'd be you know like a transvestite", "16:07", "who was semi homeless but it was you", "16:10", "know made up who was like reading her", "16:12", "poetry and I was like I'm in like I'm", "16:17", "done and I had no money and I would sit", "16:19", "and crouched on the floor and drink like", "16:21", "a half a beer and be like oh this is", "16:23", "crazy and I would watch her read from", "16:25", "her journal and I did a similar thing", "16:27", "where I would just and it was always I", "16:29", "didn't I didn't know my own mind or my", "16:31", "own thoughts really so I would write", "16:32", "down random words and I would perform it", "16:34", "I mean and still now it's you know I've", "16:38", "progressed a bit but it's like it", "16:40", "informs you how the audience reacts or", "16:42", "it begins to and I just love seeing all", "16:45", "these like different people and what", "16:46", "what they thought they were saying", "16:48", "versus what they were really saying and", "16:50", "what their intended effect was and how", "16:52", "people were really seeing them anyway so", "16:55", "so comics started dropping into these", "16:57", "rooms like Patton Oswalt and jeremy", "17:01", "kramer and blaine capatch and you know", "17:03", "the Greg Behrendt all these Ron Lynch", "17:06", "people that were more San Francisco", "17:08", "affiliated that were there at that time", "17:11", "would start doing these open mic nights", "17:14", "but because a comic is so versed in", "17:18", "their own voice that watching them was", "17:23", "so I was like oh that they know how to", "17:26", "speak and they're more polished and then", "17:28", "that was attractive to me so so I kind", "17:30", "of gravitated towards and there were all", "17:32", "these alternative", "17:34", "rooms that weren't comedy clubs right", "17:36", "and that was like I loved that I just", "17:38", "loved it because there was room for", "17:41", "mistakes there was room for the", "17:43", "in-between you know it was like that the", "17:44", "the the real alt scene of that time yeah", "17:48", "that alt scenes interesting it's always", "17:51", "interesting with like a little branch of", "17:52", "a style of comedy breaks off you know", "17:55", "and some people do it because that's", "17:59", "like it it's it feels more true to them", "18:01", "right and then some people do it because", "18:03", "it seems like the cool hip thing to do", "18:04", "and then some people it's just a", "18:07", "combination of both right the all teens", "18:10", "is an interesting scene you know cuz it", "18:13", "also is attached that one place it", "18:15", "doesn't pay
