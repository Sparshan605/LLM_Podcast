today so", "01:37", "marked morning a lot about that and what", "01:42", "was your first experience that was", "01:44", "ineffable for you it's like what subs", "01:47", "news yeah well the first um the first", "01:50", "experience I had with anything outside", "01:52", "of the norm was MDMA that was the first", "01:56", "like world what I didn't know this was", "01:57", "available you know I was in verse like", "01:59", "introduction to the idea of", "02:02", "consciousness altering experiences and", "02:05", "then the next one was psilocybin and", "02:08", "then the first ineffable experience you", "02:12", "realized oh I am connected directly to", "02:14", "the development suicided pretty much", "02:16", "things yeah the UM dose that the MDMA", "02:19", "experience was just a realization how", "02:22", "insecure I was and how insecure but in", "02:25", "general are in our interactions with", "02:27", "each other and how much of our", "02:28", "interactions with each other are sort of", "02:30", "dependent upon our perceptions about", "02:33", "people are going to react to us and that", "02:35", "we have this like woman that that wall", "02:38", "completely went away on MDMA and I found", "02:40", "that fascinating you know I didn't know", "02:42", "that that state was available but then", "02:44", "the psilocybin experience was one where", "02:46", "I just sort of kind of understood it", "02:49", "that was the first time I'd ever really", "02:51", "wrapped my head around the fact that", "02:52", "this is not the top of the ground and", "02:56", "you're not standing on something and", "02:58", "there's not an above you but that you're", "03:00", "sort of in the middle of everything I've", "03:02", "never really had that in my my own head", "03:04", "before that was the first time where", "03:07", "like it just sort of really dawned on me", "03:09", "and I have watched the cosmos", "03:11", "documentaries had seen a bunch of", "03:13", "different you know right things", "03:15", "astronomy where I sort of kind of got", "03:17", "the idea that worth the outside edge of", "03:19", "the galaxy and this galaxy is swimming", "03:22", "in these galaxies but it never really", "03:24", "sunk in until the one mushroom trip I'm", "03:27", "like whoa you know we should really sort", "03:30", "of wrap your head around like that it", "03:32", "goes that way forever and that with", "03:34", "you know it's a weird sort of turtles", "03:37", "all the way down and the DMT was always", "03:40", "described in tea as mushrooms times a", "03:42", "million plus aliens yeah yeah yeah have", "03:47", "you had much experience with ayahuasca", "03:48", "no no my business partner the guy makes", "03:59", "stuff he's done twice down to Peru now", "04:03", "four seven seven to seven days a time oh", "04:06", "yeah between three and four experiences", "04:09", "also did what you got too much Picchu", "04:12", "and too many times that's out of it I", "04:15", "mean been there oh oh we've got a co one", "04:19", "place I've ever been this really", "04:20", "craziest Chichen itz\u00e1 sale via nature", "04:23", "railways and I've ever been to well", "04:25", "you're ahead of me there I for some", "04:28", "reason I've never been to the Mayan room", "04:31", "really but I've been to the Inca ruins", "04:33", "like probably six or seven times just", "04:37", "just because I go down there so much I", "04:39", "do a lot of stuff down which are you", "04:42", "know both research and teaching and all", "04:45", "that what is your take on you know", "04:48", "Oh yo what's a call yo Tumbo or to Tom", "04:51", "Cole anti Tom oh that's that the", "04:53", "incredibly large rocks and fitted in", "04:56", "unusual like jigsaw puzzle spaces yeah", "04:59", "fuck did they do that that's a good", "05:01", "question what's your town yeah man well", "05:06", "you know I don't really know my my", "05:08", "opinion of I mean the other place you", "05:10", "see that is sucks my model which is you", "05:13", "know the ruins complex outside cusco", "05:16", "similar thing you know rocks half the", "05:18", "size of this room that have been moved", "05:20", "around i don't know how they do it but i", "05:24", "will tell you one thing you must know", "05:26", "Graham Hancock", "05:28", "well his had one part okay he his", "05:31", "writings have completely changed my", "05:34", "perspective on that whole thing because", "05:36", "I think he's right I think that the", "05:39", "Incas could not possibly have built I", "05:42", "mean all of this in the hundred years", "05:47", "you know the the height of the Inca", "05:49", "Empire was basically from 1450 to 1550", "05:52", "they say before that there was much you", "05:55", "know but I don't buy it", "05:57", "I and he says his postulate is that the", "06:01", "Incas didn't create all this monumental", "06:04", "architecture they sort of moved in that", "06:06", "this came from a much more ancient", "06:08", "civilization possibly us back as far", "06:12", "back as fifteen thousand years you know", "06:15", "not all the ruins but some of them like", "06:18", "the the Sun gate at Lake Titicaca do", "06:21", "without godean talks about how look at", "06:24", "its astronomical orientations and all", "06:27", "that it's aligned with thee with the", "06:32", "equinox you know as they were fifteen", "06:36", "thousand years ago I think his I think", "06:40", "fingerprints of the gods which I'm only", "06:42", "about halfway through is just a", "06:44", "fascinating book you've read it right", "06:46", "yes it just throws the whole picture of", "06:49", "archaeology into you know into question", "06:53", "he's not a crazy really person he's", "06:56", "presenting evidence like these maps yet", "06:59", "he talks about in the first chapter this", "07:02", "is not stuff that he's dreamed on who", "07:05", "also the geological evidence on Sphinx", "07:07", "that's another was logical that it", "07:09", "brings up yeah the the more recent", "07:11", "studies have shown that there's a layer", "07:15", "about at about twelve thousand years", "07:17", "where they repeatedly find this glass", "07:19", "that exists from nuclear explosions when", "07:22", "they blow up nuclear bombs war from", "07:23", "asteroid impacts right I think that a", "07:25", "twelve thousand years ago", "07:27", "probably hit by a devastating meteor", "07:29", "shower yeah I found that in the same", "07:31", "level all across the world they found", "07:33", "this you know it was like a global", "07:35", "catastrophe at about 12,000 years and", "07:38", "that's confirmed and they've been", "07:40", "finding this over and over and over", "07:41", "again you know it stands to reason that", "07:43", "if we do have all these ancient tales of", "07:47", "catastrophic events and civilizations", "07:50", "wiped out that there must have been", "07:51", "something and most likely we are you", "07:55", "know we build we fall astronomical", "07:58", "events or global volcanic eruptions that", "08:03", "changed everything yeah yeah it's not", "08:06", "implausible I mean you don't have to you", "08:08", "don't have to invoke miracles it's just", "08:10", "it's something that happens and somehow", "08:12", "we I mean I don't understand why", "08:17", "archaeology is it's another one of these", "08:20", "things that it's a denial about this", "08:22", "stuff yeah or well did you hear what", "08:26", "they found about cheese", "08:27", "they found the more recent studies have", "08:29", "shown that the the oldest the carbon", "08:32", "dating they're getting back from these", "08:33", "cheese making whatever they were pottery", "08:37", "whatever fuckers", "08:38", "7,000 years you know they're making", "08:40", "cheese 7,000 years ago that's not that", "08:43", "mean that is that's advanced stuff and", "08:46", "when you you add that to the really the", "08:50", "previous notional so at 6,000 years ago", "08:53", "like sumar\u00e9 those probably the oldest", "08:55", "thing we know then they find Gobekli", "08:57", "tapping right as they're uncovering that", "08:59", "and they don't for sure that's at least", "09:01", "14,000 at least 14,000 right so I think", "09:05", "it's entirely plausible it's not that", "09:09", "far-fetched to think that there may have", "09:12", "been some get some contact with an", "09:16", "extraterrestrial civilization I mean you", "09:19", "find this myth", "09:23", "you're talking about listen necessarily", "09:25", "and I'm really sure you jump from", "09:26", "civilizations are older than thought to", "09:29", "you sexiest other than that yeah oh but", "09:33", "they all have this this myth of in the", "09:37", "Incas a new world it's very culture of a", "09:42", "superior being who appears that there's", "09:46", "historically critical juncture and", "09:48", "basically symbolizes is any possibility", "09:51", "that if that superior being is some dude", "09:53", "who grew up in the other part of the", "09:54", "world that had the mushrooms their whole", "09:56", "culture evolves to a radically higher", "09:59", "level and then they get in boats and", "10:01", "come over to these eight white people", "10:03", "they're still throwing sticks and glue", "10:05", "together much they haven't gotten yeah", "10:07", "something like that shopping bag of", "10:09", "mushrooms ago catch you cats in a couple", "10:11", "of decades work it out herself yeah they", "10:16", "came back think is the slaughtering", "10:18", "people no I got you guys doing it wrong", "10:20", "right right so you know I don't know", "10:24", "this is why we need to admit time travel", "10:26", "so we could actually go back and verify", "10:28", "just what the fuck was going on somebody", "10:31", "said something was it was one of the", "10:33", "most I may have been kurtzweil I don't", "10:35", "remember who it was but he said that one", "10:38", "day they're going to get to a point", "10:41", "where computer processing power is so", "10:44", "incredible that you are going to be able", "10:46", "to take you on all the data on all the", "10:49", "variables of life and circumstances on", "10:51", "this planet and calculate those and go", "10:54", "back in time based on what we have today", "10:57", "and knowing how fast cars are what it", "11:01", "takes to burn gasoline but all of these", "11:03", "the massive insane amount of data and", "11:07", "literally be able to extrapolate what", "11:09", "what happened in the past through some", "11:12", "sort of a mathematical equation yeah", "11:13", "it's impossible for us to wrap our heads", "11:15", "around now because we're just not there", "11:18", "yet but whatever it's a thousand years", "11:19", "from now five thousand years from there", "11:21", "literally we'll be able to at least go", "11:24", "back in time in", "11:26", "Meishan way well this so this is similar", "11:28", "to I'm going to say it I think say", "11:31", "you're gonna say the physics of", "11:32", "immortality now or actually I'm pretty", "11:35", "sure foundation is as most foundations", "11:38", "like based on that idea except they use", "11:40", "demographic to calculate what will", "11:42", "happen", "11:43", "yeah I'm plan for a society right based", "11:46", "on these incredibly complex computer", "11:48", "algorithms about here's the demographics", "11:50", "here's the economics here's the social", "11:52", "dynamics you can predict what will", "11:54", "happen what will happen everything the", "11:57", "finest level of detail yeah well you", "12:00", "know Frank tipplers work the physics", "12:03", "would be more child with you know I've", "12:04", "heard he didn't everything in that book", "12:06", "yeah it's interesting I mean he had this", "12:08", "idea that you know computing power like", "12:12", "he says like Kurzweil computing power is", "12:14", "exponentially increasing and that at", "12:18", "some point it will be possible to", "12:20", "simulate heaven and that you know people", "12:27", "it will be essentially possible to well", "12:33", "to enter a simulated world that is the", "12:39", "the world beyond death that is", "12:42", "envisioned by the world's major", "12:44", "religions and but this is you know at", "12:46", "the end of time we will in fact all be", "12:49", "resurrected into this as computer", "12:52", "simulations of ourselves view for you're", "12:55", "familiar with this most recent idea of", "12:58", "computer simulation theory that they", "13:00", "have actually found this self repairing", "13:03", "computer suffered repairing mathematical", "13:08", "code in the equations of string theory", "13:11", "we seal and stuff no this guy was with", "13:16", "Neil deGrasse Tyson how this interview", "13:19", "with this physicist that's trying to", "13:20", "explain it but it was a type of", "13:22", "self-correcting computer code that they", "13:24", "discovered in 1940 or was invented and", "13:27",
