the fact that he wasn't wrong", "11:26", "that there was something over there and", "11:28", "then of course he he said whoever sees", "11:31", "the island first gets a prize and the", "11:33", "guy

he would just describe that like", "12:48", "that's how he knew he'd been at sea", "12:51", "since he was a teenager Genoa is tended", "12:53", "to go to sea because there were slave", "12:55",
