if they'd", "65:52", "done with this warrior gene how has", "65:54", "someone been exonerated where was it I", "65:57", "think it was in a court in Italy we're", "66:00", "just sentencing was decreased because", "66:02", "the defense made an argument afterwards", "66:04", "well genetically predisposed so like", "66:09", "that's slavery isn't Italy the place", "66:12", "where they charged

not how it works you", "66:42", "are a little surprised Christ I can't", "66:44", "tell you what it's coming you'll be I", "66:46", "would eat to another country ball so the", "66:48", "fuck is wrong with you oh no my son the", "66:51", "scientist is like being convicted of", "66:53", "murder", "66:54", "so it's essentially in these less", "66:56", "informed areas where these things have",

"67:08", "wish for in terms of wow the creative", "67:10", "people learn more about science yay more", "67:13", "the sign a way more through the outer", "67:16", "great there's a little bit of it might", "67:18", "be scary let's see I'm just going on eat", "67:20", "yeah I know it's 6:15 table to actually", "67:23", "wrap it up surface thank you so much", "67:25", "really really appreciate this pleasure", "67:26", "I've been a fan of yours for years this", "67:28", "is a real trust me I was really looking", "67:30", "forward to it alright everybody this is", "67:32", "a short one but an
