ready to fight kabhi it's not", "95:52", "like he's been out a while they offered", "95:54", "him the khabib fight he tried to cut", "95:55", "wait for it and he might have fucked", "95:57", "himself that way is that what it was", "95:58", "yeah it's entirely possible they're", "96:00", "still trying to figure out what happened", "96:02", "well one of the pieces of speculation is", "96:03", "that his body started shutting down", "96:05", "because he went through a real bad cut", "96:08", "for the when he was trying to make the", "96:10", "khabib fight at 55 on super short note", "96:12",

seems", "96:56", "like an interim title belt is almost", "96:58", "disrespectful yes like he's he's the", "97:00", "champ makes no sense but I think I just", "97:02", "like it was find out but I feel like was", "97:05", "a corporate decision when they went okay", "97:07", "we have to fight we need to fill this", "97:09", "gap we have to fight will they ask to", "97:11", "fight some of you of

and he's like let's do this", "97:50", "for the real number one contender spot", "97:51", "cuz Usman is a guy who has quietly been", "97:54", "beating everybody they put in front of", "97:56", "you his last what he has and I love him", "97:58", "his last fight wasn't the most exciting", "98:00", "but if you go through you know who Maya", "98:03", "has fought you look at the way Kobe did",
