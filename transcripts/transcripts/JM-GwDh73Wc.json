"95:00", "fucking thing you've ever seen in your", "95:02", "life it's like 14 inches tall right and", "95:04", "then on top of that it's got like all", "95:07", "these safety features it's looking at", "95:09", "things and warning you about this and", "95:11", "shows you or all the cars are around you", "95:13", "as you're driving I was like having my", "95:15", "mom in the front seat sounds like just", "95:16", "to get something over there something", "95:18", "here watch out for that Huns like all", "95:19", "right shut up what if your mom was", "95:21", "psychic and - just sending it
