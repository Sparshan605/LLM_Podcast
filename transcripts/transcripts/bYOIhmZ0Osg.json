ago", "12:07", "there is some pretty influential", "12:10", "research published suggesting that HDL", "12:13", "may not be actually so protective and it", "12:16", "may be more of like a like a

Wow", "13:05", "so it's just another example of", "13:07", "something that we just assume for so", "13:09", "long it's true we find out that it's not", "13:12", "true I had a conversation with a guy

diabetes", "18:07", "one-third one-third and that is crime", "18:11", "having a hard time what if you had just", "18:14", "asked me like what percentage of", "18:16", "Americans have diabetes I probably said", "18:18", "like 4% yeah who actually have type 2", "18:23", "diabetes is lower it but I said", "18:26", "pre-diabetes or type 2 down there way", "18:28", "yeah so so here a couple other

that's it's an autoimmune", "25:23", "condition and it's strongly genetically", "25:26", "mediated so it's which means that it", "25:29", "doesn't you know necessarily mean that", "25:31", "if you have the genes you're gonna get", "25:33", "the disease but there's you know 50% of", "25:35", "the risk I think is the statistics that", "25:37", "I've seen of type 1 diabetes is genetic", "25:41",

"you sleep or you're you know your", "25:54", "physical activity stress management etc", "25:56", "so that means only 15 percent of the", "25:58", "risk of disease is genetic you know", "26:01",

fat", "26:27", "and weighed less and lost more weight", "26:29", "than people who did the exact same", "26:31", "activity but slept 4 to 6 hours yeah I", "26:35", "would say that among people who research", "26:39", "weight regulation sleep is now", "26:42", "recognized as being the the second most", "26:44", "influential lifestyle factor that", "26:48", "determines our weight", "26:49",

a little bit of insulin resistance", "27:08", "the next day I mean it's transient it", "27:10", "goes it goes away but that's significant", "27:12", "there was a study where they they", "27:15",

"you really be dead for eight nights in a", "27:24", "row", "27:25", "I think so yeah I mean partials you know", "27:28", "partial but significant sleep", "27:30", "deprivation for eight nights in a row", "27:31", "these people ate an additional five", "27:35", "hundred and sixty six calories a day", "27:38", "during that period with no changes in", "27:40", "resting energy expenditure so that's", "27:43", "equivalent to gaining a pound a week of", "27:45", "body weight or fifty two pounds in a", "27:47", "year so most people won't have that", "27:50", "severe of sleep deprivation but if you", "27:52", "just even have mild sleep deprivation", "27:54", "you know over a significant period what", "27:57", "if you that could account for ten pounds", "27:59", "of weight gain a year and over you know", "28:01", "ten years you're you're talking about a", "28:03", "lot of weight kick yeah so is it because", "28:06", "you're sleepy", "28:07", "so you just force yourself to eat food", "28:09", "like what no it's just a totally screw", "28:11", "it totally screws with hormone", "28:13", "production and all the hormones that", "28:15", "regulate appetite and satiety and things", "28:18", "like that", "28:18", "Oh desire and appetites higher it's hard", "28:24", "to get satiated and it also decreases", "28:27", "your willpower and judgment around food", "28:31", "so people are likely to make worse", "28:33", "choices when it comes to food I know I", "28:35", "do yeah dude if I'm really really tired", "28:38", "I immediately go to like bullshit", "28:40", "cheeseburgers or something it's uh it's", "28:43", "it's part of what been documented it", "28:45", "happens yeah you like reward yourself", "28:47", "with something that's terrible for you", "28:50", "yeah yeah and you know probably", "28:52", "be in theirs that's also related to the", "28:55", "changes in brain chemistry that happened", "28:57", "so Wow yeah Wow and and now we know that", "29:01", "the third of Americans get fewer than", "29:03", "six hours of sleep and outside of like", "29:08", "maybe three percent of the population", "29:10", "that has a gene that allows them to you", "29:12", "know be okay with that that few of hours", "29:15", "of sleep the vast majority of people", "29:17", "need seven to eight and a half hours of", "29:19", "sleep to function properly and that's", "29:20", "been clearly documented yeah I had read", "29:24", "something about outliers in terms of", "29:26", "performance outliers there are a lot of", "29:28", "people that like entrepreneurs guys are", "29:33", "killing it out there they're they're", "29:34", "getting like four to five hours sleep at", "29:36", "night and I was stunned by that I was", "29:37", "like how is that possible like how are", "29:40", "these people that are you know they're", "29:41", "doing all these physical activities", "29:43", "working out running their business and", "29:46", "then I found out about adderall right so", "29:49", "there's that yeah I mean as I said there", "29:51", "are some genetic polymorphisms that we", "29:54", "at least some research suggests that", "29:56", "allow people to you know deal with less", "30:00", "sleep than others but yeah I think in", "30:02", "that community there's a lot of", "30:04", "stimulant use that's driving that and at", "30:06", "some point they're gonna pay the price", "30:07", "yeah they need to come clean about that", "30:09", "like that's the dirty little secret I", "30:11", "have friends that are entrepreneurs in", "30:13", "Silicon Valley people and the way they", "30:15", "describe it it's like like people", "30:17", "chewing gum right it's just everywhere", "30:19", "everyone is doing new vigil provigil", "30:23", "which are apparently less problematic", "30:26", "and then adderall across the board yeah", "30:29", "it's crazy I mean we're we're making", "30:31", "choices now both you know individually", "30:33", "and collectively that are taking us in", "30:35", "the wrong direction and you know the", "30:40", "this this we've shared a few stats that", "30:42", "kind of blew you away and they've blown", "30:44", "me away too you know when I was", "30:46", "researching the book this is how it all", "30:47", "came together for me it was it was like", "30:49", "a wake-up call you know so I was", "30:51", "six-year-old daughter I know you have", "30:54", "kids today's kids are the first", "30:57", "generation that are expected to live", "30:59", "shorter lifespans than us their parents", "31:02", "that's just crazy you know as we based", "31:06", "on", "31:06", "the statistic about diabetes yeah all", "31:09", "this dramatic increase in chronic", "31:11", "disease so as long as we've been", "31:13", "measuring it and the

measuring it's", "31:21", "just going up up up up and now this is", "31:24", "the first generation of kids it's", "31:25", "actually expected to start going back in", "31:27", "the other direction I showed my kids", "31:28", "that sugar Documentary my wife showed it", "31:31", "to them it lasted about four months and", "31:33", "they were like who gives a shit let's", "31:36", "get back to the ice cream dad you know", "31:38", "it's the kids like it's hard yeah we're", "31:42", "hard this is where the evolutionary", "31:44", "perspective is so important for people", "31:47", "to understand we're we're hardwired to", "31:49", "seek out foods that are calorie dense", "31:52", "and highly rewarding and by rewarding", "31:54", "I'm talking about that term in the", "31:56", "scientific contact contacts which means", "31:59", "eating something makes you want to eat", "32:01", "more of it right so potato chips ice", "32:05", "cream highly rewarding because you'll", "32:07", "keep eating them even beyond the point", "32:09", "where your hunger has been satisfied", "32:11", "right a baked potato with no salt or", "32:13", "butter not very rewarding", "32:16", "you know you'll eat if you're hungry", "32:17", "you'll eat it but you won't eat more", "32:19", "than you're hungry for and even a steak", "32:21", "which is most people like and it's and", "32:25", "tastes good when's the last time you", "32:26", "heard about somebody binging on a steak", "32:28", "well it doesn't really happen because", "32:30", "it's not highly rewarding in that way", "32:32", "but human beings evolved in an", "32:35", "environment of food scarcity so we have", "32:37", "these hardwired genetic biological", "32:40", "mechanisms that cause us to seek out", "32:43", "foods that have a lot of calories and it", "32:46", "are very palatable and rewarding because", "32:49", "that would signal to us that they have", "32:52", "different different nutrients", "32:53", "macronutrients flavors etc and we're in", "32:57", "an environment of food scarcity that", "32:59", "works really well because you know", "33:01", "stocking up on calories would allow us", "33:03", "to survive a period of you know famine", "33:06", "or food shortage or you know unable to", "33:09", "locate food etc so we have all these", "33:12", "mechanisms that were originally designed", "33:14", "to help us survive starvation in the", "33:16", "natural environment", "33:19", "that's all well and good when we're", "33:20", "living in that kind of environment but", "33:22", "what happens when we live in an", "33:23", "environment where there is a 7-eleven on", "33:25", "every corner and Amazon delivering food", "33:29", "your door and in Costco around the you", "33:32", "know around the block food is everywhere", "33:34", "and so all of these mechanisms actually", "33:37", "helped us to survive in our ancestral", "33:39", "environment cause set us up for failure", "33:42", "in this modern food environment and we", "33:45", "capitalized on that with things like the", "33:47", "banana split yeah well the thing is the", "33:50", "big big food they they hire scientists", "33:55", "who understand these mechanisms and", "33:57", "specifically designed foods to hit all", "34:00", "of those circuits you know what do you", "34:03", "think is like probably is there a", "34:04", "statistically most addictive food I", "34:08", "don't know actually the answer to that", "34:10", "question I mean there's there's a lot of", "34:11", "controversy about whether sugar is", "34:13", "addictive in the sent in in the true", "34:15", "sense of the way that scientists use the", "34:18", "term addictive like meth yeah exactly", "34:22", "but and there both sides of that debate", "34:24", "but I think most of us can have you know", "34:27", "just on our own personal experience can", "34:29", "kind of assess the effect that sugar has", "34:33", "on us or our kids or whatever it's", "34:35", "highly rewarding in the sense that it", "34:37", "makes us want more and more of it yeah", "34:39", "it's not addicted to me in the sense of", "34:41", "like I get a detox if I'm not having it", "34:44", "but if it's around me and I want it the", "34:47", "craving is very creepy right you know", "34:49", "like what is this Jamie most addictive", "34:52", "foods pizzas number one yeah Wow based", "34:56", "on a healthful and calm study I tell you", "34:58", "what man this there might be something", "35:00", "to that well when we were in New York", "35:02", "and you brought over those slices of", "35:04", "pizza god damn those are good they can", "35:07", "figure out a way to make that pizza here", "35:09", "we'd have real problems well it's", "35:10", "interesting that you showed that because", "35:13", "the top six foods in the American diet", "35:16", "according to the amount of calories that", "35:19", "they comprise in our diet are pizza", "35:23", "Brad

foods", "35:36", "comprise the majority of the calories", "35:38", "that the average American eats and then", "35:41", "you look at our ancestral diet it was", "35:43", "mostly you know meat and fish

even", "35:56", "available to us at this point but you", "35:58", "know sweet potatoes would be our kind of", "35:59", "modern analog of that and so you have a", "36:03", "situation where we evolved

is", "42:08", "what I'm talking about this is that", "42:10", "thing right there", "42:11", "example I like to use there's a parasite", "42:14", "that the whole lifecycle is really", "42:16",

that", "43:19", "the only way that Toxoplasma can", "43:22", "reproduce his inside the cat's gut yeah", "43:24", "which is just insane like what kind of a", "43:27", "twisted system and how did this evolve", "43:30", "over all these years like the gut biome", "43:33", "and a gut bacteria it is so fascinating", "43:37", "to me well here's a here's a an", "43:40", "interesting way of looking at you know", "43:41", "Justin Sonnenberg no microbiologist at", "43:44", "Stanford really interesting guy", "43:46", "brilliant he I'm gonna paraphrase this", "43:50", "because I won't get the quote exactly", "43:51", "right but he wrote a book about the gut", "43:54", "microbiome and he said something the", "43:57", "effect of humans are just the elaborate", "44:00", "elaborate vessels for the

they've been around", "44:16", "a lot longer than us a lot longer they", "44:20", "outnumber us you know that the the", "44:23", "number of microbial cells in the body", "44:25", "more than the number of human cells so", "44:28", "you know there's lots of different ways", "44:30", "to interpret that but I think at the", "44:32", "very minimum you start to see how", "44:34", "important that microbial community is to", "44:37", "our overall health and also our behavior", "44:39", "yeah and if you really want to get", "44:41", "creepy think about how like", "44:42", "categorically they don't very", "44:44", "individually like there they're", "44:46", "essentially the exact same thing in mass", "44:49", "numbers acting in the interest of the", "44:52", "mass numbers right and then influencing", "44:55", "us which vary widely and our different", "44:58", "actions propagate them in different ways", "45:01", "yeah I'm freaking out it's yeah", "45:03", "especially weird too when you think that", "45:05", "all of that stuff all of those", "45:07", "microorganisms that are in our gut", "45:08", "they're not actually in our body so", "45:10", "they're not really part of us they're", "45:12", "just hanging out there well think about", "45:13", "a tunnel so you go through a tunnel", "45:16", "under a river right you're not in the", "45:18", "river ooh you're just in the tunnel", "45:21", "under the river Ryan our our gut is a", "45:25", "hollow tube that goes from our mouth to", "45:27", "our anus intersects our body but", "45:29", "everything inside the tube is", "45:31", "technically outside of the body so", "45:39", "they're influenced they're influencing", "45:41", "us from inside the tunnel from inside", "45:44", "the tunnel they're not really inside of", "45:45", "our bodies so they're kind of running", "45:47", "the show but they're not really in us so", "45:49", "it's like a car inside the tunnel that's", "45:52", "controlling the river yeah Jesus Christ", "45:57", "[Laughter]", "46:02", "and the crazy thing is that they can", "46:04", "affect mood you can affect depression", "46:07", "they can affect your ambition the way", "46:10", "you behave everything I just saw a study", "46:13", "on the way down here and you know I get", "46:15", "a feed of all the new research and it", "46:17", "showed that overgrowth of bacteria in", "46:19",

"something going on and with the cars and", "46:33", "the tunnel is really tweaking the river", "46:34", "in just about every way you can imagine", "46:36", "it's not just about gut as you know", "46:38", "affects every system of the body so paul", "46:41", "ski was saying that one of the people", "46:43", "that he worked with found during his", "46:44", "residency that there was a", "46:45", "disproportionate number of motorcycle", "46:48", "accidents that were attributed to people", "46:50", "were infected by Toxoplasma because it", "46:53", "made them more impulsive right I could", "46:55", "change human behavior as well yeah well", "46:57", "I think we talked about this last time", "46:59", "but the the prevalent theory now and", "47:01", "what causes depression is that it's a", "47:03", "disruptive gut microbiome that causes", "47:05", "inflammation it it leads to the", "47:08", "production of what are called cytokines", "47:10", "they're chemical messengers inflammatory", "47:12", "cytokines they travel across the gut", "47:15", "barrier they go into the blood travel up", "47:17", "into the brain and cross the blood-brain", "47:20", "barrier and then they suppress the", "47:21", "activity of the frontal cortex which", "47:23", "causes all the tell-tale signs and", "47:25", "symptoms of depression changes so what", "47:27", "if depression which we have always", "47:29", "thought about either as a disruption of", "47:31", "brain chemistry or something that's", "47:33", "purely situational is actually a you", "47:37", "know has a physiological cause as a", "47:39", "driver now that's not to say that those", "47:42", "situational factors don't matter I don't", "47:43", "want to be reductionist here and say", "47:45", "depression is only caused by gut", "47:47", "inflammation I think that's ridiculous", "47:49", "but the problem is the average person", "47:52", "goes into the doctor with depression", "47:54", "they're going to come out of that office", "47:56", "with a prescription for an", "47:57", "antidepressant there's not going to be", "47:59", "any investigation into their gut and", "48:02", "whether they have inflammation in the", "48:03", "gut and intestinal permeability there's", "48:06", "not going to be a referral to a", "48:07", "gastroenterologist to check that out and", "48:10", "this is of course one of the problems", "48:12", "with the conventional system the way", "48:13", "it's set up is we had a doctor for every", "48:16", "different part of the body and there's", "48:18", "no quarterback that's really overseeing", "48:21", "that whole thing the probably ideally", "48:22", "that would be the primary care provider", "48:24", "but because their appointments or 10", "48:26", "minutes they've got 2,500 patients on", "48:28", "their roster there's no time for that", "48:30", "yeah you'd have to find a doctor that's", "48:32", "very meticulous it's willing to go over", "48:33", "your blood work for you and check out", "48:36", "what your diet is yeah would take hours", "48:38", "and wnl as they say we're not looking so", "48:42", "imagine a patient that goes into the", "48:44", "doctor and they've got depression let's", "48:46", "say they've got eczema or psoriasis", "48:49", "they've got", "48:51", "digestive issues and they've got you", "48:56", "know brain fog cognitive problems like", "48:58", "whole big roster of symptoms and the", "49:01", "primary care provider might give them an", "49:03", "antidepressant for the depression they", "49:04", "give them a steroid skin cream for the", "49:06", "skin problem they you know they they", "49:08", "leave with the handful of medications", "49:10", "but what if there was one thing that was", "49:13", "causing all those problems or one", "49:14", "underlying cause it was leading to all", "49:16", "that so just you know in this example", "49:19", "what if that patient had gluten", "49:20", "intolerance and they hadn't been", "49:22", "properly diagnosed we know now from the", "49:24", "research that gluten intolerance doesn't", "49:26", "just cause the GI distress a lot of", "49:28", "people get it also can cause you know", "49:31", "it's associated with dermatitis which is", "49:33", "eczema it's associated with all kinds of", "49:36", "cognitive and neurological problems so a", "49:40", "single food protein could be leading to", "49:43", "all of these different symptoms but in", "49:45", "the conventional system they might go to", "49:47", "the primary care doctor then they get a", "49:48", "referral to the dermatologist they get a", "49:50", "referral to a gastroenterologist they", "49:52", "maybe get a referral to a neurologist or", "49:54", "a psychiatrist they're seeing all these", "49:56", "separate people to deal with all these", "49:57", "separate symptoms like you know playing", "49:59", "whack-a-mole with the symptoms they take", "50:01", "you know one drug the antidepressant but", "50:05", "then maybe the antidepressant causes", "50:06", "constipation so then you go the", "50:08", "gastroenterologist and they get a drug", "50:10", "for the you know a laxative for the", "50:12", "constipation and then before you know", "50:14", "it's just this incredibly complex web of", "50:17", "all these drug interactions and and all", "50:20", "the focuses on suppressing these", "50:21", "symptoms with different doctors for", "50:23", "different body parts when in this", "50:25", "example at least it was something as", "50:28", "simple as a food protein they could be", "50:30", "easily removed from the diet maybe not", "50:33", "easily glutens in a lot of things but", "50:36", "taken out and then all of those problems", "50:39", "which seem like they were separate and", "50:40", "disconnected go away mmm and that's", "50:43", "really the promise of functional", "50:44", "medicine because instead of looking at", "50:48", "things starting with the symptoms and", "50:50", "then working backwards we're starting", "50:52", "from the the the inside and working out", "50:56", "so you know an analogy I like to use is", "51:00", "if you have a rock in your shoe and it's", "51:02", "making your foot hurt you go to a canoe", "51:05", "the conventional system you'll end up", "51:06", "with the diagnosis of foot pain or", "51:09", "actually it will be fancier you know", "51:11", "they'll be like the Latin name for foot", "51:12", "and pain or something so it sounds more", "51:15", "official if you know and then you'll get", "51:17", "a painkiller and the painkiller will", "51:19", "help you know it'll reduce the pain a", "51:21", "little bit", "51:21", "but obviously it makes a lot more sense", "51:23", "to just take your shoe off and dump out", "51:25", "the rock and that's really what", "51:27", "functional medicine is about now when it", "51:29", "comes to gluten intolerance that's one", "51:31", "that gets dismissed because it sounds it", "51:34", "sounds frivolous so all of a sudden", "51:35", "everyone's gluten intolerant like this", "51:37", "is crazy but my belief is that there's", "51:40", "varying levels of this and that it's", "51:42", "something that people have just", "51:44", "dismissed is a weird feeling that you", "51:46", "get after you eat gluten yeah and that", "51:48", "they're not really in tune with the", "51:50", "effect of inflammation and that there's", "51:53", "a real difference between the wheat of", "51:55", "today and the weed of say the early", "51:57", "1900's it's been manipulated I think", "52:00", "there are a few reasons there's", "52:01", "misunderstanding about this number one", "52:02", "is that there up until recently has not", "52:07", "been a an understanding of the", "52:10", "difference between celiac disease and", "52:11", "non-celiac gluten sensitivity so for a", "52:14", "long time the idea was either you have", "52:16", "celiac or you're not sensitive room", "52:18", "that's it I've heard that no recently", "52:20", "yeah there's no gray area that's", "52:21", "preposterous anyone who still believes", "52:23", "that has not even done the most cursory", "52:26", "search of the scientific literature you", "52:28", "can go in and anyone who's what who's", "52:30", "listening or watching can go to PubMed", "52:33", "gov PU bmed gov in the search field type", "52:37", "non-celiac gluten sensitivity or non", "52:40", "celiac wheat sensitivity and tell me how", "52:42", "many results come up do it it's gonna be", "52:45", "a lot okay and it's going to be linking", "52:48", "and this goes to the second point it's", "52:50", "going to be linking not just to gut", "52:52", "problems in diarrhea it's going to link", "52:54", "to all kinds of different conditions", "52:56", "from depression to anxiety to heart", "52:58", "issues to hormone imbalance to cognitive", "53:03", "problems etc so that's the second", "53:05", "problem is historically how many 650", "53:10", "Jesus and I and and there's lots of", "53:14", "others if you use some different", "53:15", "terminology you can find more", "53:17", "so with celiac disease the initial idea", "53:20", "was it it's it just causes diarrhea and", "53:23", "you know severe diarrhea and cramping", "53:25", "and so the assumption was that that if", "53:28", "you don't have severe diarrhea and", "53:30", "cramping when you eat gluten you don't", "53:31", "have celiac and you don't have any other", "53:34", "kind of gluten intolerance but we now", "53:36", "know that the with celiac there's a", "53:40", "there are forms called atypical or", "53:42", "silent celiac these are forms that do", "53:44", "not present with the typical gut", "53:47", "presentation and the number of atypical",

"that you have for gluten when you", "54:57", "consume that gluten the gluten goes into", "54:59", "the gut and interacts with your gut", "55:01", "biome and then what's the what's the", "55:03", "mechanism there's two different", "55:04", "mechanisms in celiac there's an", "55:06", "autoimmune mechanism where the proteins", "55:08", "in gluten the body creates antibodies", "55:10", "towards

"55:31", "transglutaminase - is is is typically", "55:34", "found in the gut so that's why a lot of", "55:36", "people who have celiac have these got", "55:38", "issues is because their body is actually", "55:40", "attacking the gut tissue and ranking it", "55:42", "down it's an autoimmune reaction but now", "55:45", "we know that Trent they're that same", "55:47", "autoimmune reaction can be directed at", "55:49", "transglutaminase 3 which is primarily in", "55:51", "the skin which is why something like 30%", "55:54", "of people with celiac also have eczema", "55:57", "and other skin

ataxia", "56:31", "because it's attacking the brain the", "56:33", "immune system is attacking the brain and", "56:35", "that leads to some potentially very", "56:37", "serious problems when did they start to", "56:39", "alter wheat like what what what year do", "56:41", "you know I don't know and I do think", "56:44", "that is an issue because I've there's so", "56:48", "many people who have gone to Europe you", "56:50", "know they eat wheat here and they go to", "56:51", "Europe they can eat wheat and yeah it's", "56:53", "fine yeah but I think there are some", "56:56", "other things that are actually more", "56:58", "meaningful and significant and this", "56:59", "leads me to the third reason why I think", "57:01", "we've underestimated you know gluten", "57:04", "sensitivity and why people don't", "57:05", "understand how significant it can be", "57:09", "we're not living in a vacuum you know so", "57:12", "let's let's say you've got a person who", "57:15", "is like a

five hours a night there", "57:43", "they've taken antibiotics", "57:45", "you know 30 by 30 courses of antibiotics", "57:47", "by the time they're an adult which is", "57:48", "not an exaggeration

their immune system", "58:08", "seriously dysregulated and then when", "58:11", "they get exposed to gluten which might", "58:13", "otherwise be a harmless protein it", "58:15", "causes problems so I think the reason", "58:19", "that more people are intolerant of", "58:21", "gluten and intolerant of other foods now", "58:23", "is is not just because the foods have", "58:26", "changed it's because

proteins but when our", "58:39", "immune system breaks down we talked", "58:41", "about the gut as a barrier system where", "58:43", "everything that's inside the gut is", "58:45", "outside the body it's important to", "58:47", "understand like in that the purpose of", "58:51", "the gut is to serve as a Selective", "58:53", "barrier that this that determines what", "58:55", "gets in and what stays out because", "58:58", "everything we eat is either absorbed or", "59:01", "eliminated as waste and if that barrier", "59:04", "becomes permeable in a non-selective way", "59:07", "meaning it loses the ability to make", "59:12", "appropriate decisions about what gets in", "59:15", "and out then food proteins that would", "59:17", "otherwise be benign and and you know be", "59:20", "broken down into smaller particles and", "59:23", "those small particles get absorbed and", "59:26", "don't cause any problems the larger food", "59:28", "proteins get absorbed before they're", "59:30", "broken down and then that initiates an", "59:32", "immune reaction that wreaked havoc Wow", "59:36", "so if someone has a healthy gut then the", "59:39", "insult of some sort of a gluten protein", "59:42", "being introduced into their guy's not", "59:43", "gonna be as big of a deal as if someone", "59:45", "is just drinking Gatorade all day and", "59:47", "eating cognizing that makes sense is", "59:50", "it's like any other ecosystem so if you", "59:52", "think of like an ecosystem that's really", "59:54", "healthy and you introduce you know a", "59:56", "predator predator or", "59:58", "you know another mall something else", "60:00", "that could could potentially throw it", "60:02", "out of balance it won't go out of", "60:03", "balance because the whole ecosystem is", "60:05", "working together to keep that in check", "60:07", "mmm", "60:07", "but then you know you hear about like", "60:10", "those small islands where they introduce", "60:12", "a particular you know a predator or or a", "60:15", "prey species that then just because the", "60:17", "ecosystem of that Island is fragile you", "60:20", "get a huge proliferation right you know", "60:22", "where it's just all of a sudden there's", "60:23", "nothing but deer the island yeah and", "60:26", "until they start dying because of that", "60:28", "imbalance you know and then it starts", "60:30", "all over again so I've seen that before", "60:33", "I've seen that in Hawaii on lanai right", "60:36", "there overrun with an animal called", "60:38", "access deer they're all over the place", "60:40", "and for that same reason and so we have", "60:43", "the same phenomenon like if we have if", "60:46", "if someone's got microbiome is severely", "60:48", "disrupted especially and and that", "60:50", "started as a kid and they start they", "60:52", "develop gluten intolerance they develop", "60:54", "intolerance to corn and soy and dairy", "60:56", "and allergy this is why allergies are on", "60:58", "the rise and kids is my belief it's it's", "61:01", "not because there's some weird you know", "61:03", "all of a sudden someone introduced some", "61:05", "kind of poison that is causing kids to", "61:08", "be more allergic it's because of immune", "61:10", "dysregulation right and that's happening", "61:12", "because of the sleep issue the food and", "61:14", "all of the other aspects of the modern", "61:16", "lifestyle so what's the best approach", "61:18", "for someone who wants to be healthier if", "61:21", "they want to take control their gut", "61:22", "biome is it just consuming a lot of very", "61:25", "strong probiotic foods so that the first", "61:28", "thing is to just eat real food I mean I", "61:31", "I really like to boil it down to that", "61:33", "three words you know eat real food and", "61:35", "buy real I mean not stuff that comes in", "61:37", "a bag or a box you know that the less", "61:39", "processed and refined better in some", "61:41", "city that came out of the ground or", "61:43", "lives on the ground right exactly and", "61:45", "you know there are a lot of we tend to", "61:48", "get really you know worked up about all", "61:51", "the differences between you know there's", "61:53", "because you could say eat real food and", "61:55", "do vegan you could say you build food", "61:56", "and do paleo and you know that that's", "61:59", "all great but I I really actually", "62:00", "believe that if people just ate real", "62:02", "food of any kind we'd be in a totally", "62:04", "different place than we are now", "62:05", "and do individual health issues should", "62:08", "be worked out in the variations of those", "62:10", "diets exactly that's where the find", "62:12", "freaking comes but we didn't get to this", "62:14", "point because you know everyone's eating", "62:17", "real food and everyone's doing vegan or", "62:19", "everyone's doing paleo we got to this", "62:21", "point because people are eating trash", "62:23", "essentially so one of the most key", "62:26", "things with the gut microbiome to", "62:27", "understand is that our healthy gut", "62:30", "bacteria thrive on what are called", "62:31", "fermentable carbohydrates or just in", "62:34", "Sonnenberg who we talked about before he", "62:37", "called the microbiota accessible", "62:38", "carbohydrates these are fancy terms that", "62:41", "just mean fiber so what what", "62:45", "distinguishes fiber is that we don't", "62:46", "break it down and turn it into glucose", "62:49", "or you know other molecules that we can", "62:51", "absorb and use for our own energy it", "62:54", "stays in the gut too you know all the", "62:57", "way to the colon and then the bacteria", "62:59", "eat that fiber so fiber is food for our", "63:02", "beneficial gut bacteria and that's what", "63:04", "makes them thrive so that's fascinating", "63:06", "cuz most people think of fiber they", "63:08", "think of it almost is like like a", "63:10", "laxative yeah", "63:11", "yeah they think of there's something", "63:12", "that's gonna clean out their bowels so", "63:14", "not all fiber is fermentable by the gut", "63:17", "bacteria some fiber just has that", "63:19", "mechanical effect it's more like you", "63:21", "know pushing things through the bowels", "63:22", "whereas other fiber can actually be used", "63:25", "as food by your gut bacteria and that", "63:27", "fiber is probably more bad system or the", "63:29", "more beneficial sorry are you talking", "63:30", "like sauerkraut kimchi think so yeah", "63:33", "there's soluble fiber that that's", "63:35", "present in a lot of fruits and", "63:36", "vegetables", "63:37", "you've got non-starch polysaccharides", "63:41", "like inulin and fos and things like that", "63:43", "that are in like onions and garlic", "63:45", "Jerusalem artichokes leeks and then", "63:49", "you've got resistant starch which is", "63:52", "actually not that's in a lot of starchy", "63:54", "plants that we used to eat you know way", "63:56", "back in Paleolithic era and some", "63:59", "traditional hunter-gatherers still do", "64:01", "but resistant starch these days can be", "64:04", "found in certain types of starches that", "64:08", "have been cooked and cooled like", "64:09", "potatoes or lentils some people now are", "64:13", "supplementing with resistant starch or", "64:15", "they're eating like green unripe bananas", "64:17", "unripe plantains you know what are those", "64:20", "those do that because they're unripe", "64:24", "it's the start", "64:25", "is resistant as they ripen the starch it", "64:27", "becomes just regular starch so I cook", "64:32", "those like if you wanted to cook up a", "64:35", "green plantain you can slice them and", "64:37", "then dehydrate them and you make them", "64:38", "into chips you can even buy plantain", "64:41", "chips now at some how food store", "64:43", "plantain chips that's what you're", "64:44", "getting you're getting dehydrated", "64:45", "getting some resistant starch there oh", "64:47", "yeah thing or you can bake a white", "64:50", "potato for example and then let it cool", "64:53", "and that cooling process is what forms", "64:55", "the resistant starch and this is what's", "64:57", "really interesting you know most people", "64:59", "think of potatoes is something that", "65:00", "would spike their blood sugar because", "65:02", "they have a lot of carbohydrate but when", "65:05", "you cook and cool the potato it won't", "65:07", "have that effect because the resistance", "65:09", "start you can't absorb and break that", "65:11", "into glucose whoa so so when you cool a", "65:14", "potato it's better for you yeah so", "65:17", "they're that like a cold potato salad", "65:19", "would actually not have the same effect", "65:21", "on your blood sugar is eating a warm", "65:23", "baked potato that you just cooked in", "65:28", "fact crazy you heard of the potato hack", "65:30", "no this is probably the most effective", "65:34", "diet that I've ever come across for", "65:36", "weight loss and this is what I use with", "65:38", "in my practice with patients when like", "65:40", "nothing else has worked or if someone", "65:42", "super motivated and just wants to make", "65:44", "progress quickly guy named Tim steel", "65:48", "introduced me to this and it was he has", "65:52", "sent me some books that he found in the", "65:54", "1880s that reference this diet so this", "65:57", "is old-school and what you do is you", "66:00", "basically eat nothing but potatoes and", "66:04", "you but you don't they're plain potatoes", "66:07", "so you can roast them or boil them but", "66:10", "you don't you know in the hardcore the", "66:12", "hardest core version you don't even add", "66:13", "salt it's just plain baked potato or", "66:16", "boiled potato certainly no butter chives", "66:20", "sour cream bacon you know because that", "66:22", "increases the reward value as we were", "66:24", "talking about earlier right the more", "66:26", "variety there is the more rewarding of", "66:28", "food is okay so you just eat potatoes", "66:32", "and let's there are different variations", "66:35", "or different ways of doing it you can do", "66:37", "it for maybe just three days a week", "66:39", "and then you can do your normal diet you", "66:41", "know the other four days a week", "66:43", "Tim talks about a variation called", "66:44", "potatoes by day which means you just eat", "66:47", "potatoes for breakfast and for lunch and", "66:49", "then you eat a normal dinner but in my", "66:52", "clinic and what and from Tim's", "66:54", "experience working with a lot of people", "66:55", "most people will lose an average of a", "66:58", "half pound a day and I think there are", "67:01", "two there there there are a few things", "67:03", "happening here and why it works", "67:05", "number one it's it's totally playing", "67:09", "towards these mechanisms that we talked", "67:10", "about before the the the the reward", "67:13", "value of food which is called the", "67:15", "hedonic system that drives our food", "67:18", "craving and preferences and just let's", "67:19", "do a thought experiment if you have two", "67:22", "plates of food and on one plate you have", "67:24", "a steamed potato with no salt or butter", "67:28", "or fat of any kind and on this plate on", "67:31", "the right you got bag of potato chips or", "67:33", "just the plate of potato chips which one", "67:36", "are you gonna eat less of I mean it goes", "67:39", "without saying right you're only gonna", "67:40", "eat the potato when you're when you're", "67:42", "hungry and you're not gonna eat probably", "67:44", "a bite more than you're hungry for", "67:46", "whereas the potato chips all bets are", "67:49", "off", "67:49", "yeah for most people and so what happens", "67:52", "is when you do the potato diet you get a", "67:54", "spontaneous calorie reduction and by", "67:56", "spontaneous I mean not voluntary you're", "67:59", "not you setting out to say okay I'm only", "68:01", "gonna eat a thousand calories today", "68:03", "you're saying I'm gonna eat as many", "68:04", "potatoes as I want to satiate my hunger", "68:07", "but just by definition because of how", "68:10", "our brain works you're only going to eat", "68:12", "you're going to eat less then you would", "68:14", "typically so that's one thing you get a", "68:17", "reduction in calorie intake the second", "68:20", "thing is that when when you cook the", "68:23", "potato people the way they do this diet", "68:25", "is they'll just cook like you know all", "68:27", "the potatoes that they need for the week", "68:29", "on Sunday to make it easy so then I have", "68:32", "to cook the potato every time they sit", "68:33", "down to eat so they cook the potatoes", "68:36", "and then they let them cool and so then", "68:38", "each time you can still heat them back", "68:40", "up but but they now have a lot of", "68:43", "resistant starch even if you heat them", "68:45", "back up even if you hit them back up and", "68:47", "here's what's really cool about it if", "68:48", "you heat them up and cool them again", "68:51", "each cooling cycle form", "68:52", "more resistance arch so that by the end", "68:55", "of the week if you've if you're heating", "68:57", "all of the potatoes back up and then", "68:58", "cooling them again each time you're", "69:00", "gonna have a potato that's mostly", "69:02", "resistant starch which means it will", "69:03", "have zero impact on your blood sugar and", "69:05", "it will be like a feast for your", "69:08", "beneficial gut microbiome and that's", "69:11", "another reason this diet probably works", "69:13", "we I'm you know all about the studies", "69:15", "correlating disrupted gut microbiome", "69:17", "with obesity and diabetes yeah so you're", "69:20", "basically the way I tell patients is", "69:23", "you're basically going on an all fiber", "69:25", "diet mmm and you leave the skin to you", "69:28", "can eat the skin you should eat the skin", "69:30", "Tran yeah yeah yeah skin has vitamins in", "69:32", "it right so people will lose up to a", "69:36", "half a pound you know between a quarter", "69:37", "and a half a pound a day that they're on", "69:40", "the potato diet it's amazing so if you", "69:42", "let's say you know you decide I want to", "69:45", "I want to lose one and a half pounds a", "69:46", "week", "69:47", "you do it for three days a week and you", "69:49", "do that for six months then by the end", "69:51", "of that six month period you've lost a", "69:53", "pretty significant amount of weight if", "69:55", "you can keep that up if you can keep it", "69:57", "off the blandness of it that's another", "69:59", "fascinating aspect about diet it's like", "70:01", "how much of our life we we were willing", "70:04", "to forego health happiness all these", "70:07",

that I eat", "70:39", "you know it's but and this is why I say", "70:43", "I don't suggest that anyone should start", "70:45", "here but I think it's interesting", "70:46", "because it gets at some of what we've", "70:48", "already been talking about how why the", "70:50", "modern food environment contributes to", "70:52", "obesity and how using that knowledge and", "70:55", "understanding of what triggers you know", "70:57", "us to eat we can turn that around and", "71:00", "use it in our favor so another strategy", "71:03", "that similar is to just eat but not", "71:06", "quite as extreme", "71:07", "eat the same thing for breakfast lunch", "71:09", "and dinner for like two or three days in", "71:10", "a week so you get bored with it that way", "71:13", "exactly mmm that seems like all

and all that stuff and so", "76:19", "you know my these days my average day is", "76:22", "kind of like no breakfast fasting that I", "76:26", "might have wet mark Sisson calls a fat", "76:29", "bomb salad for lunch if you know if I", "76:32", "have lunch I might have a later lunch so", "76:35", "that would be like a salad with a little", "76:36", "bit of protein chicken fish etc and then", "76:39", "like kava kado and olives and you know", "76:42", "really good healthy fats and then if I'm", "76:47", "not doing a ketogenic phase I'll have a", "76:49", "normal dinner which would look like a", "76:51", "portion of protein a lot of non starchy", "76:53", "vegetable and like a sweet potato or a", "76:56", "plantain or some taro root or some one", "77:00", "of these paleo friendly

like some zucchini noodles or", "77:12", "turnip noodles you can get like a", "77:14", "spiralizer and main the noodles really", "77:16", "easily and I would put some additional", "77:18", "fat on those those you know vegetable", "77:21", "noodles or I might just have another non", "77:23", "starchy vegetable along with fat or", "77:25", "salad so you're essentially just", "77:27",

"77:43", "you're not yeah so for me because I'm", "77:46", "lean obvious", "77:48", "the and I have a fast metabolism I can", "77:53", "do keto for a couple weeks and feel", "77:55", "pretty good", "77:56", "I've done it for as long as three months", "77:58", "so I've done you know the full", "78:00", "experiment and what happens is after", "78:03", "about two or three weeks my exercise", "78:05", "tolerance and recovery starts to go down", "78:07", "so I start to have less capacity to do", "78:10", "like more glycolytic activities", "78:12", "explosive movements you know", "78:14",

"that's interesting so why would it be", "78:28", "beneficial done what's beneficial about", "78:29", "it well I think so two things number one", "78:33", "not everybody has that response a lot of", "78:36", "people just feel better and they they're", "78:38", "able to do it for a sustained period of", "78:40", "time and they don't have that problem", "78:41", "number two I the way I'm trying to do it", "78:45", "is kind of replicating what I think was", "78:48", "typical in the ancestral environment so", "78:52", "most hunter-gatherer cultures that we've", "78:54", "studied would have naturally had periods", "78:57", "of food scarcity so they're not always", "79:00", "starving but because they don't have a", "79:02", "7-eleven on the corner or Costco or", "79:04", "whatever they would have periods where", "79:06", "they weren't successful in a hunt so you", "79:08", "know they would go without eating or", "79:09", "they would eat less that's just built", "79:11", "into our our template I think and so I", "79:15", "thing where I'm you know I'll do", "79:17", "intermittent fasting for a period and I", "79:19", "might do a week or two of ketosis and", "79:21", "then I might just eat my normal diet for", "79:23", "you know six weeks or two months after", "79:25", "that and then I might do another week of", "79:26", "ketosis and I don't schedule it I don't", "79:29", "plan it I just let my body tell me you", "79:31", "know Oh kind of feels like all I want to", "79:34", "do that now and are you doing blood", "79:36", "tests oh you are doing breath test how", "79:38", "you're monitoring you keto no I totally", "79:40", "so I have the blood ketone monitor and", "79:43", "from all the research that I've seen at", "79:46", "this point breath ketone testing is not", "79:48", "accurate at higher levels of ketosis", "79:51", "it's it's accurate at lower levels but", "79:53", "when you get into the therapeutic range", "79:55", "around 2.0 you know 1.5 to 2.0 which is", "79:58", "kind of the sweet spot for me", "80:00", "then blood ketones are more accurate and", "80:02", "the problem with the blood ketone strips", "80:05", "is they're super expensive especially if", "80:07", "you buy them just like at the drugstore", "80:08", "or something like that but I if you you", "80:13", "can look around and try to find them in", "80:15", "bulk and they're cheaper that way and", "80:16", "and frankly at this point and I think", "80:18", "that's true for most people once you get", "80:20", "used to it you know and you've done it", "80:22", "enough you don't need to keep using them", "80:24", "over and over you just kind of know when", "80:25", "you're gonna be in ketosis right when", "80:27", "you're not and I've tracked my my values", "80:31", "and I've tracked you know I've treated", "80:32", "hundreds of patients where we've done", "80:33", "these kinds of experiments and this goes", "80:36", "back to the discussion about LDL so for", "80:39", "me on a ketogenic diet you know if I", "80:42", "measure my on my typical diet my LDL", "80:45", "particle number is about 1,200 so I'll", "80:47", "just briefly describe what that is", "80:48", "because I think some people might not be", "80:50", "familiar with that so if if you imagine", "80:53", "that your your your bloodstream is like", "80:56", "a highway the cars on the highway are", "80:59", "the LDL particles and the passengers in", "81:02", "the cars are the cholesterol that are", "81:05", "carried by the LDL particles so for", "81:07", "years we've measured the the passengers", "81:10", "the cholesterol inside the particle and", "81:12", "now most research suggests that it's", "81:14", "actually the number of particles or cars", "81:16", "on the road that is the biggest driver", "81:19", "of heart disease risk not the amount of", "81:21", "cholesterol inside of them so you can", "81:24", "measure this so you know LabCorp and", "81:26", "quest they all have the test panel", "81:29", "called an NMR where you can measure the", "81:31", "number of particles that you have and so", "81:34", "my normal diet is around eleven or", "81:36", "twelve hundred which is technically hot", "81:39", "it's high normal or you know in a kind", "81:41", "of intermediate range I'm not worried", "81:43", "about that level but when I go Kido my", "81:47", "LDL goes above two thousand which is in", "81:50", "like the 99th percentile and and a high", "81:52", "high risk range so this is where I was", "81:56", "talking before about getting to a point", "81:58", "where we can be maybe a little more", "82:00", "personalized in terms of the", "82:01", "recommendations that we make because not", "82:03", "everyone who goes quito experiences that", "82:05", "you know some people do and some people", "82:07", "don't what do you think that is oh it's", "82:10", "just the that in that you know for me", "82:12", "you know on a keto type of", "82:14", "diet it affects my lipids in that way", "82:18", "and no this is a much larger", "82:20", "conversation around does that actually", "82:23", "increase my risk of heart disease again", "82:25", "I said before we know that higher LDL on", "82:27", "average in the general population does", "82:29", "but if if like let's say I have a", "82:34", "doppelganger and yeah genetically some", "82:36", "identical to me and everywhere an", "82:38", "identical twin and that one is not", "82:40", "eating healthy not exercising not", "82:43", "sleeping you know not doing anything to", "82:46", "take care of himself and he has a LDL P", "82:49", "that's high and I have that LDL P that's", "82:52", "high and they're exactly the same", "82:54", "do we think that we're gonna be at the", "82:56", "same risk of heart disease just because", "82:57", "that one number on the paper is exactly", "83:00", "the same that's the assumption that's", "83:01", "made in the conventional research", "83:04", "literature right but I think almost", "83:06", "anybody just common sense would say no", "83:08", "that's not true there are many other", "83:10", "factors that determine the risk of heart", "83:12", "disease so getting back to this thing so", "83:15", "for me with Kido one of the reasons I", "83:19", "mean the main reason I don't do it", "83:21", "ongoing is I don't feel well when I keep", "83:25", "doing it like I said number two I don't", "83:27", "like doing it long to her and I think", "83:29", "that's important and number three I", "83:32", "don't necessarily want to have an LDL P", "83:34", "of 2,000 but you do think there are some", "83:36", "benefits to occasionally doing I think", "83:38", "that it was very natural for human", "83:40", "beings to be in ketosis at least part of", "83:43", "the time and whether you enter into that", "83:45", "by just fasting mm-hmm", "83:47", "or whether you do it with a ketogenic", "83:49", "diet I don't know that that really", "83:51", "matters I mean fasting has some", "83:52", "additional benefits above and beyond", "83:54", "just ketosis like Auto Fuji which is a", "83:57", "cellular cleanup and repair process that", "84:00", "happens in a fasted state if you think", "84:03", "about it if fasting and or being in a", "84:06", "fasted State was a normal part of human", "84:08", "evolution it makes sense that certain", "84:10", "processes would only happen in that", "84:12", "fasted State it does make sense but I", "84:15", "would feel like when I'm talking to you", "84:16", "about based on your experience I would", "84:19", "avoid being in ketosis altogether", "84:21", "because it sounds like it sucks for you", "84:22", "know it doesn't those first two weeks", "84:24", "are really great and great yeah and then", "84:27", "it starts to", "84:27", "shift over dom D'Agostino said that", "84:30", "there's like a there's an adaptation", "84:33", "period yeah usually three weeks is the", "84:36", "full period for most people but like I", "84:38", "said I've done a full you know longer", "84:40", "experiment so I know it wasn't just a", "84:42", "question of me not being fat adopted I", "84:44", "think he was talking about several", "84:45", "months in terms of like athletic", "84:47", "performance when your performance starts", "84:48", "- yeah I think that varies a lot from", "84:51", "person to person also varies how quickly", "84:53", "someone can get into and out of ketosis", "84:55", "I go into it very quickly for me like", "84:58", "just the second if I do one day of", "85:01", "fasting or one day of keto on the second", "85:03", "day I'll generally be at 11.2 which most", "85:06", "people say is in a therapeutic range and", "85:09", "then by the third or fourth day I'll", "85:10", "usually be at - without a lot of effort", "85:12", "and do you regulate your protein intake", "85:14", "when you're doing a ketogenic diet as", "85:16", "well to avoid protein converting to", "85:18", "again that's highly individual from what", "85:20", "I've seen from Mia protein doesn't seem", "85:22", "to be that significant of a lever I've", "85:24", "tried you know I did an experiment where", "85:27", "I was just fasting in the morning so I", "85:29", "had no protein and I would have three", "85:31", "ounces of protein only with the salad at", "85:34", "lunch and then I would have a kind of", "85:35", "normal sized portion of protein so", "85:37", "that's actually pretty low protein for", "85:39", "someone of my size yeah", "85:42", "and that and then I've done it where", "85:44", "I've just done keto where I've had", "85:46", "protein for breakfast lunch and dinner", "85:47", "it doesn't seem to make a big difference", "85:49", "for me but I have patients for whom", "85:51", "that's that's actually as big of a lever", "85:53", "as carbohydrate yeah I had Tom Bill you", "85:56", "on the podcast and he was one of the", "85:58", "founders of quest nutrition yeah and he", "86:00", "said one of those quest bars would not", "86:02", "come out of ketosis right just because", "86:04", "the amount of protein I'm like that's", "86:05", "crazy yeah and I think they're only like", "86:07", "what is like 18 grams or anything", "86:10", "somewhere in the range that's why it's", "86:11", "that's why it's so important for us to", "86:13", "get over this idea that there's one", "86:15", "approach that will work for everyone", "86:16", "it's just stupid I know you know Rob", "86:18", "Wolfe have you ever seen Rob Wolf's", "86:19", "experience that he does on his Instagram", "86:21", "yeah and his wife yeah they both eat the", "86:23", "same things yes totally different", "86:25", "results as far as their blood sugar", "86:27", "his wife metabolizes things far quicker", "86:29", "than he does now it's really interesting", "86:31", "that's really interesting because you", "86:33", "seeing two people that live together", "86:35", "that you know they're eating the exact", "86:37", "same foods yeah", "86:39", "and to and you know that he's so", "86:42", "fascinated by it himself and makes an", "86:44", "interesting - yeah I mean it's it's so", "86:47", "it's so necessary for us to take that", "86:50", "step because you see so much like you", "86:52", "know wasted energy in my opinion of", "86:55", "people arguing back and forth", "86:57", "yeah it's often based on like you know", "86:59", "Joe Blow goes on a low-carb diet has", "87:01", "life-changing experience and becomes", "87:04", "like a almost religious zealot for the", "87:07", "low-carb lifestyle right and assumes", "87:09", "that because it had that effect on him", "87:12", "that it's gonna have that effect on", "87:13", "everybody else and and just starts you", "87:16", "know proselytizing for a low-carb yes", "87:18", "not recognizing that first someone else", "87:21", "for example many of my female patients", "87:24", "go on low-carb and is if they're like", "87:27", "you know working and taking care of kids", "87:30", "and doing Crossfit several times a week", "87:32", "you know that could be a disaster for", "87:34", "them it really might not work and so you", "87:37", "know we just got a we got to take the", "87:39", "next step yeah you have to take into", "87:41", "account biodiversity but there's a lot", "87:42", "of people that dismiss ketogenic diets", "87:45", "because that's not what they've been", "87:46", "promoting yeah that's that's an issue as", "87:48", "well like you got to be real careful", "87:51", "about someone who's not citing actual", "87:52", "science when they're talking and", "87:54", "dismissing the ketogenic diet like I", "87:56", "read someone talking saying that it was", "87:58", "a fad that's hard to get into ketosis", "88:00", "that it rarely happens like well that's", "88:03", "just not true yeah that's actually", "88:04", "factually wrong yeah I've done it many", "88:10", "times I'm not in it right now but I do", "88:13", "the same thing but for me it's a set of", "88:15", "boredom yeah I get bored and I want a", "88:17", "peanut butter and jelly sandwich or", "88:18", "something then BOOM I'm out well again I", "88:20", "think that's that's probably closer to", "88:23", "the ancestral pattern of not being in it", "88:25", "continually but you know there are some", "88:28", "people who need to be in it continually", "88:29", "like ketosis can be a life changing", "88:32", "intervention for kid with epilepsy for", "88:35", "example and those kids benefit from", "88:38", "being a deep ketosis so they might", "88:39", "actually even need exogenous ketones on", "88:42", "top of the ketogenic diet hmm but they", "88:44", "can go from having you know 40 seizures", "88:47", "in a day or being on like just

think that that is uh I don't know", "89:18", "if it's the same or but very close if I", "89:23", "just follow a low-carb diet not", "89:25", "necessarily ketogenic but eliminate", "89:28", "refined

playing", "89:56", "in the background and that's the ketones", "89:58", "you know because the brain can utilize", "90:00", "ketones may even prefer ketones to", "90:02", "glucose and so when you're producing", "90:04", "those ketones it really does take the", "90:06", "edge off of hunger yeah yeah", "90:09", "and it also fuels the brain in an odd", "90:11", "way I mean I find that before I do",

we're actually things re", "91:59", "growing and and the the reason for this", "92:02", "this it's thought is that this the", "92:04", "fasting can promote stem cell", "92:06", "regeneration so you can actually through", "92:09", "fasting rebuild certain parts of your", "92:11", "body according to this research so and", "92:14", "then there was the auto fiji which i", "92:16", "mentioned before

they", "95:33", "might maybe maybe not make any kind of", "95:36", "dietary recommendations and then send", "95:38", "you on your way and the idea is we're", "95:41", "not gonna pay attention to this until", "95:42", "it's not normal you know we're not gonna", "95:44", "pay attention to this until you actually", "95:46", "do have pre-diabetes or diabetes and so", "95:50", "the wait until you have that and then of", "95:52", "course the longer that you wait to treat", "95:54", "it the harder it is to reverse and then", "95:56", "you and then when when once they do find", "95:59", "that you have it they just gave you a", "96:00", "drug rather than you know give you any", "96:03", "kind of real support to make diet", "96:06", "changes so even if the doctor is it does", "96:09", "know what to do or what to tell you", "96:11", "about diet which they often don't", "96:13", "because they just don't have a lot of", "96:14", "training in that area and it's also how", "96:16", "few people really have the contents of", "96:19", "their body analyzed how many people", "96:21", "actually get blood work done percent", "96:24", "don't even know they have pre-diabetes", "96:25", "yeah but let's assume that they do and", "96:27", "let's assume they get to the doctor and", "96:28", "let's assume the doctor even knows what", "96:30", "to tell them right if they tell them", "96:32", "that are they is that going to be enough", "96:35", "to make that person successful and", "96:37", "changing their diet especially not if", "96:39", "their gut biome is programmed to crave", "96:41", "that

"97:05", "long-term", "97:05", "yeah but let's imagine a different", "97:07", "scenario let's imagine you go into the", "97:09", "doctor same thing they test your blood", "97:12", "sugar it's you know high normal fasting", "97:15", "glucose high normal a1c and they sit", "97:17", "down they say look Joe and this is", "97:19", "obviously happening in an appointment", "97:20", "that's longer than eight minutes right", "97:22", "they sit down they say well you're not", "97:25", "pre-diabetic yeah but your blood sugar", "97:28", "is starting to creep up and I'm worried", "97:29", "that if we

putting a bandaid on the", "97:39", "problem so what I'm going to do instead", "97:41", "is I'm gonna hook you up with our health", "97:43", "to nutritionist and he or she is going", "97:46", "to create a recipe for you a meal plan", "97:49", "they're gonna come to your house they're", "97:50", "gonna clean out your pantry get rid of", "97:52", "all the bad foods they're gonna go", "97:54",

"98:09", "get a gym membership and you're gonna", "98:12", "get set up with a personal trainer at", "98:13", "that gym and so that you can start", "98:16", "getting you know doing becoming more", "98:18", "physically active we're gonna give you", "98:20", "this online class that talks about sleep", "98:23", "hygiene and how to get better night's", "98:25", "sleep it's a six-week program you do it", "98:27", "for a half hour a day no problem and", "98:30", "here's the good news Joe this is all", "98:32", "gonna be covered by your insurance", "98:33", "you're not gonna have to pay for any of", "98:35", "this that you know that is totally", "98:39", "possible and not only that is there any", "98:42", "doubt that if even if we spent ten", "98:45", "thousand dollars let's say which is more", "98:46", "than that would cost even including the", "98:48", "health coach and the fees for the gym", "98:50", "and the fees for the personal trainer if", "98:52", "we spent that amount of money right up", "98:54", "front we could put that pert that", "98:57", "person's blood sugar back to normal", "98:59", "level prevent them from ever getting", "99:01", "type 2 diabetes in the first place give", "99:04", "them way more confidence in their own", "99:06", "ability to take care of themselves and", "99:08", "prevent disease make them feel better", "99:10", "and probably every other way and save", "99:12", "the health care system", "99:14", "six hundred then forty thousand dollars", "99:16", "over the next forty five years we could", "99:19", "have that there's nothing stopping that", "99:20", "from happening the real question is how", "99:23", "do you get someone to act that's the", "99:25", "question through inspiration I said with", "99:27", "the health coach so it's not actually I", "99:30", "mean this is well defined", "99:33", "we had there's so much research on", "99:34", "behavior change and evidence-based", "99:36", "principles that support behavior change", "99:38", "so there there are techniques like", "99:40", "motivational interviewing coaching -", "99:42", "strength coaching - strengths yeah so", "99:47", "that that means helping people identify", "99:49", "and and work with their strengths rather", "99:52", "than trying to fix what's broken", "99:55", "motivational interviewing is it", "99:57", "would be an example that like you have a", "99:58", "person works a regular normal job and", "100:01", "they've got a big gut they want to lose", "100:03", "we have a you have a it's shifting the", "100:05", "focus around from what's wrong which is", "100:08", "really disempowering like I can't do", "100:10", "that I'm this way I'd have no willpower", "100:12", "whatever to helping them become aware of", "100:15", "certain personality traits or", "100:17", "characteristics that they can then use", "100:19", "to make the change that they want to", "100:22", "make motivational interviewing is like", "100:24", "this imagine a woman who's 55 you know", "100:28", "finds out that she has type 2 diabetes", "100:30", "and the doctors like you should eat a", "100:31", "better diet and she's she would like to", "100:34", "but she's overworked and tired and it", "100:37", "feels overwhelming and and she's just", "100:40", "not really finding the motivation to do", "100:42", "that in this you know but she has", "100:44", "grandkids she loves her grandkids she", "100:46", "wants to see them grow up she wants to", "100:48", "be able to play that with them without", "100:49", "becoming blind and you know immobile", "100:51", "from type 2 diabetes and so the the", "100:54", "health coach is trained in motivational", "100:56", "interviewing can help her help that that", "100:59", "patient to be able to tie that those", "101:02", "deeper values and goals and and you know", "101:05", "motivations with the health goal so that", "101:08", "it's not just eating a healthy diet for", "101:11", "the sake of eating a healthy diet its", "101:13", "eating a healthy diet because I really", "101:15", "want to see my grandkids grow up and be", "101:17", "able to play with them mmm okay so and", "101:19", "then there are these principles of", "101:21", "behavior change that are that are", "101:22", "totally well established so one is", "101:25", "shrink the change is a colloquial way of", "101:29", "putting it like let's say you're gonna", "101:31", "start a meditation practice the way to", "101:34", "not do it is to just say okay so start", "101:38", "doing it do an hour meditation a day", "101:39", "good luck with that you know that's", "101:41", "gonna fail in 99.9% of the cases the way", "101:45", "to do it might be okay it's step one", "101:48", "not even that step one download the", "101:50", "headspace app on your phone that's it", "101:53", "that's your first step you know step two", "101:55", "but get a meditation cushion that's it", "101:57", "step three you know open the headspace", "101:59", "up and do your first two-minute", "102:02", "meditation I mean the headspace app is", "102:03", "actually built in this way where they", "102:05", "start you very small and you build up", "102:07", "gradually over time because they know", "102:09", "about those prince", "102:10", "of behavior change we know that behavior", "102:13", "change works better in community this is", "102:16", "it this is a head spinner to obesity", "102:19", "some people have argued is a contagious", "102:21", "disease because people who have friends", "102:24", "that are obese are more likely to be", "102:26", "obese themselves you know what that", "102:29", "makes a lot of sense and here's an", "102:32", "example of something one of the reasons", "102:33", "why that makes a lot of sense we just", "102:35", "did this thing sober October me and now", "102:39", "that yeah and Ari Shaffir Tom Segura", "102:42", "Bert Kreischer and I we took 15 hot yoga", "102:44", "classes no booze no weed for a month but", "102:47", "because we were doing it all together", "102:49", "and we kept checking in on each other it", "102:50", "was very motivating yeah and and no one", "102:54", "strayed and we all were doing it too we", "102:57", "we knew that we had we had all we had a", "103:02", "responsibility we responsibilities to", "103:04", "the group and that we we knew who we", "103:07", "were motivating each other as well as", "103:09", "pushing each other and talking shit to", "103:11", "each other and making each other but at", "103:15", "the end of it we were like wow that was", "103:17", "great like there's something to that", "103:19", "like a lot of us were like I'm never", "103:21", "doing yoga again Frank yoga and I'm", "103:23", "getting put drunk for a week but the", "103:25", "real takeaway from it was there was some", "103:28", "measurable motivation and inspiration", "103:31", "from having three friends doing it with", "103:34", "me absolutely that's and that's again", "103:36", "improving in the science and even just", "103:39", "having one person like a health coach", "103:40", "you know that role and be accountable", "103:42", "they can help you you know

perhaps online groups", "103:54", "there's got to be online groups you", "103:55", "should get involved with we have the", "103:57", "knowledge and the technology to do this", "103:59", "and it's not

close as we're gonna get to a", "115:11", "normal human population right yeah so", "115:13", "they study they studied they did blood", "115:16", "markers on them for heart disease but", "115:18", "not only that they did scan CT scans of", "115:21", "their heart you know to see if they had", "115:22", "calcification of the arteries they found", "115:25", "that the rate of heart disease in this", "115:26", "population was 80% lower than it was in", "115:29", "the", "115:30", "it is in the u.s. eighty percent lower", "115:33", "okay nine and ten saman any adults that", "115:37", "they studied

so", "117:28", "I mean my point is just that what you", "117:33", "said when are we going to realize that", "117:34", "just these changes you know making these", "117:36", "changes is what we need to do to prevent", "117:38", "and reverse chronic disease and", "117:41", "we have these examples of people like", "117:43", "the Semana that show us very clearly", "117:45", "that's the way we're living not our", "117:47", "genes that are causing this chronic", "117:49", "disease epidemic so the easy way would", "117:52", "be to you know write books about it you", "117:56", "know have shows like this keep educating", "117:57", "people and doing that and that's what", "118:00", "I'm hoping for and that's why I wrote my", "118:02", "book but the hard way is that our system", "118:06", "fails that it becomes so overburdened by", "118:10", "the rising rates of chronic disease and", "118:12", "the unsustainable expenses of that that", "118:15", "it basically falls apart and it becomes", "118:19",

of", "118:38", "depends on whether you're a", "118:39", "glass-is-half-empty or glasses to have", "118:42", "full type of person yeah well from your", "118:45", "own personal point of view if you're",

how it's", "118:55", "really gonna you know my personal view", "118:57", "is it's gonna be a little of both", "118:59", "actually so I think what's gonna happen", "119:01", "is you're gonna start seeing some big", "119:04", "changes on the more local grassroots", "119:06", "level so we've already seen stuff like", "119:08", "this examples of be there's a group", "119:12", "called ir a-- health

think not just respiratory", "160:14", "yeah things like systemic inflammatory", "160:16", "conditions and the problem with toxins", "160:19", "is our initial understanding of toxic", "160:23", "toxicity was only like acute toxicity", "160:25", "like what happens if you get so much", "160:27", "mercury in your body so quickly that it", "160:29", "causes like an acute problem and we", "160:32", "assume that you know if you don't see", "160:36", "acute toxicity then there's no problem", "160:38", "like there's nothing in between acute", "160:40", "toxicity and just normal right we know", "160:42", "now that like there was a really", "160:44", "interesting study a couple of years back", "160:46", "I wrote about this on my blog I think", "160:48", "the title was something like mercury", "160:49", "fish consumption and kids studio came up", "160:55", "today this is a really bad", "160:57", "air pollution caused car accident", "161:00", "pile-up in New Delhi these people are", "161:02", "trying to get people out of that car in", "161:03", "just a couple seconds it's just like a", "161:05", "snowstorm here in America another car", "161:07", "comes slamming into them oh

my god so these people", "161:18", "so these people are standing there and", "161:20", "they can't see oh my god this is on a", "161:24", "freeway oh my god oh my god", "161:28", "they gotta get the fuck out because", "161:29", "another one to come in yeah it's insane", "161:32", "oh my god this is all just air pollution", "161:36", "there oh my god this is incredible this", "161:41", "is like they're in the fog on a mountain", "161:44", "road and they're on the highway this is", "161:47", "what is the name of this video so we can", "161:49", "watch on Twitter I had to find on", "161:50", "Twitter it's literally going around the", "161:51", "decile right before the show start", "161:52", "that's oh my god New Delhi car accident", "161:58", "air pollution oh my god this is insane", "162:00", "and they're telling these people get out", "162:02", "what do you do like you go up to try to", "162:06", "warn people it's they can't see you", "162:08", "there either yeah and then what if", "162:10", "someone takes a turn and hits those", "162:11", "people to the side oh god this is", "162:13", "horrific I spot where it ends right here", "162:15", "oh my god yeah so I mean these are like", "162:19", "so the mercury thing you know the idea", "162:23", "for a long time was if your blood levels", "162:26", "below ten parts per million you're fine", "162:27", "there's no evidence you know there's", "162:29", "nothing there's no issue so this new", "162:31", "study came out and they looked at kids", "162:32", "and they looked at cortisol levels which", "162:35", "and in inflammatory markers and they", "162:39", "found that kids that had mercury levels", "162:42", "that were even as low as one so you know", "162:46", "almost ten times lower than the level of", "162:49", "concern had higher levels of cortisol", "162:51", "and higher levels of inflammatory", "162:52", "markers and they ma so that totally", "162:56", "turned things on their head it was like", "162:58", "all of a sudden you know lower levels of", "163:01", "the talks of these toxins than we", "163:03", "thought were problematic are actually", "163:05", "problematic and when they dove in and", "163:07", "look deeper they found", "163:09", "you know some of the kids were affected", "163:11", "had certain genetic you know", "163:13", "polymorphisms like there was something", "163:15", "that made them more susceptible or maybe", "163:17", "they had nutrient deficiencies that made", "163:19", "them less able to detoxify the mercury", "163:22", "as they normally should be able to and", "163:24", "you know what further complicates it is", "163:27", "that the symptoms that you see with high", "163:30", "levels of a toxin can actually be", "163:32", "different at low levels so let's say", "163:35", "researchers design a study to see the", "163:37", "toxic effects of mercury when when the", "163:39", "exposure is is severe and they're", "163:42", "looking for certain studies and then", "163:43", "they start lowering the dose of mercury", "163:46", "to see when those effects go away they", "163:49", "will completely miss the effects that", "163:52", "are caused by the low doses of mercury", "163:53", "because they're different than the", "163:54", "effects that they were studying at the", "163:56", "higher doses so this causes a problem", "163:58", "for years where it was assumed that the", "164:01", "low doses were harmless because they", "164:03", "weren't observing the same effects they", "164:04", "saw at the high doses and now they know", "164:07", "this and so they redesign studies to", "164:09", "look just cast a wider net and see", "164:11", "what's happening and sure enough at", "164:13", "those lower levels of toxins they're", "164:14", "seeing all kinds of effects that are", "164:16", "actually in some cases opposite of the", "164:18", "effect that you see with the high dose", "164:19", "of the toxin have you adjusted like", "164:22", "where you live or anything because of", "164:24", "all this well I you know when we are we", "164:27", "just bought a house a couple years ago", "164:29", "and we just you know we had a choice of", "164:32", "where to live we wanted to live in", "164:34", "Berkeley that's where my office is and", "164:36", "so we ended up living up on top of the", "164:38", "hill and that was about what intentional", "164:41", "for me it's right near Tilden Park which", "164:43", "is a you know outdoor Regional Park", "164:45", "space with a lot of green area and stuff", "164:47", "and and there are parts of Berkeley that", "164:50", "you know where the air quality is really", "164:52", "really bad like surprising if you don't", "164:54", "if you don't know that area if you go", "164:56", "online to some of these air quality", "164:57", "rating sites you can see that parts of", "164:59", "Berkeley are like c-minus or D there's", "165:03", "so much industry there and the Chevron", "165:04", "plan and stuff but this is where it gets", "165:07", "really you know the inequality is is", "165:09", "brutal because guess who ends up often", "165:11", "living in the areas that are most toxic", "165:14", "are the people who are you know", "165:16", "economically disadvantaged and they're", "165:19", "the least influential when it comes to", "165:22", "any kind of political power to change", "165:24", "make changes in those areas so it's", "165:27", "unfair it's it's and they're", "165:28", "disproportionately affected by that", "165:30", "because they nobody's watching out for", "165:33", "them yeah well there's a lot of factors", "165:35", "we could talk about in but I think it's", "165:39", "just it's so important that there's", "165:41", "people like you out there that are", "165:42", "highlighting these things or writing", "165:43", "books about these things and talking", "165:45", "about these things on podcast so thank", "165:47", "you so much man thank you for your book", "165:48", "and thank you for the pleasure last time", "165:50", "you were here we learned so much to tell", "165:52", "people one more time the name of the", "165:54", "book where to get
