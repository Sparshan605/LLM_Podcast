["00:01", "four three two one", "00:09", "David so first of all thanks for doing", "00:13", "this on my pleasure it excited how much", "00:15", "trouble are we in legitimately I mean", "00:17", "it's pretty bad already and it's gonna", "00:19", "get I think a lot lot worse so it's not", "00:22", "bad right now right here it's raining it", "00:24", "seems nice out the hill I mean how long", "00:25", "ago where the fires right I got a cue", "00:28", "ated this is October yeah it was rough", "00:31", "but in all fairness I've been evacuated", "00:33", "three times over the past 20 years yeah", "00:35", "I know the fires California's fires are", "00:37", "kind of interesting in that they both", "00:39", "seem like it's like the future the", "00:41", "apocalypse they're here but also it's so", "00:43", "familiar from like decades of wildfires", "00:46", "but you know their scientific estimates", "00:48", "that say that they're gonna get by the", "00:49", "end of the century sixty-four times", "00:51", "worse what yeah I think that numbers a", "00:54", "little high cuz that would mean more", "00:56", "than half of California burning every", "00:57", "year but I mean it's gonna get yeah", "01:00", "it'll get", "01:01", "it'll get crazy and there's no way to", "01:03", "avoid any of this wildfire stuff well I", "01:06", "mean you know if we don't raise the", "01:08", "temperature of the planet then but is is", "01:10", "that the only thing that's causing Wow I", "01:12", "mean like obviously if the temperature", "01:14", "raises there's more Brown dry leaves and", "01:18", "grass and stuff like that but yeah", "01:20", "there's a lot of preventative stuff you", "01:22", "can do I mean not building in certain", "01:24", "areas like I mean it used to be you know", "01:26", "the Indians who lived here before the", "01:27", "white people came did a lot of", "01:29", "controlled burning they like lived among", "01:31", "fires and I think that's like a probably", "01:34", "more responsible way to be but we've now", "01:36", "built up the whole state so that they're", "01:38", "all these homes that we don't want to", "01:39", "burn they're all these you know", "01:40", "properties we don't want to burn and", "01:41", "when you um when you like restrict the", "01:45", "ability of natural wildfires to burn", "01:47", "that means that like more tinder gets", "01:49", "built over time and then you know at", "01:51", "some point something lights the match", "01:54", "and it all burns so that I mean you", "01:57", "could you could do more controlled fire", "01:58", "you could take more aggressive action in", "02:00", "terms of you know like spraying foam and", "02:03", "that kind of thing um you could have a", "02:05", "lot more firefighters but I was just", "02:07", "talking to a guy yesterday I'm out here", "02:08", "actually doing some reporting on", "02:10", "wildfires and who was saying that no", "02:13", "Santa Ana powered wildfire has ever been", "02:15", "stopped by firefighters and he's like a", "02:17", "environmental historian wow it's like", "02:20", "you can hope that the winds redirect", "02:22", "them but like the action of firefighters", "02:23", "is basically just spitting in the wind", "02:24", "so the action is not the stop it's kind", "02:27", "of contain it", "02:28", "yeah it's best they can yeah and", "02:30", "minimize property damage yeah but you", "02:32", "know it's hard because you you have a", "02:33", "lot more it's a lot easier to do that", "02:35", "when you know if the land was totally", "02:38", "raw you'd be like all list we'll just", "02:40", "like try to direct the fire in this", "02:41", "direction but if the land is like full", "02:42", "of homes you're like what we can't you", "02:44", "have you ever seen it live not a", "02:46", "precious one yeah one time we were", "02:50", "filming Fear Factor and we were way up", "02:54", "on the five like probably I would say", "02:59", "maybe 75 miles from here and for a full", "03:04", "hour driving about 50 miles an hour", "03:06", "there was fire on the right-hand side of", "03:08", "the road for a full hour I mean like", "03:11", "Lord of the Rings end of the world yeah", "03:15", "like you're waiting for Satan to come", "03:16", "riding on a burning Phoenix over the top", "03:19", "of the hill it was crazy I've never seen", "03:21", "anything like it in my life", "03:22", "that was the worst one I've ever seen", "03:24", "but I think that was just because of", "03:26", "placement I think that this past one was", "03:29", "actually worse in terms of physical", "03:31", "damage and size it's just I didn't see", "03:33", "it the way I saw this one well last year", "03:37", "there were there were flames like", "03:38", "hopping over the 405 I mean yeah and", "03:41", "that's that's really like crazy to me", "03:43", "because you know I'm a New Yorker I've", "03:44", "lived my whole life in New York and I", "03:45", "just feel in my bones I now know it's", "03:48", "sort of not true but like my inner", "03:50", "emotional perspective on the world is", "03:52", "that I live in a fortress I don't live", "03:54", "in nature right like I walk down on", "03:56", "concrete streets I look up at steel", "03:57", "buildings nature can't come for me when", "03:59", "you see like fire straddling the 405", "04:01", "that's you know this is a major", "04:04", "metropolis here and we're not safe we're", "04:07", "certainly not totally safe and that's", "04:10", "like for me that's a major like a major", "04:13", "revelation I've had is that wherever you", "04:14", "live no matter how defended against", "04:16", "nature you are climate change is", "04:17", "teaching us that you know you still live", "04:20", "within climate and when it gets fucked", "04:22", "up it will fuck you up it will affect", "04:24", "you in some way yeah there was", "04:26", "the both sides of the 405 were in fire", "04:28", "last year last year the year before last", "04:31", "one of those but it was insane it was", "04:33", "it's it was Hank bel-air and people are", "04:36", "like well this is this we've never seen", "04:38", "this before I talked to a firefighter", "04:40", "once this was years ago and he told me", "04:43", "with the right wind it's a matter of", "04:46", "time for a fire hits the top of LA and", "04:49", "burns all the way to the ocean and heals", "04:51", "and there's not gonna be anything we", "04:52", "could do about it is if the right wind", "04:54", "catches and the fire starts at the top", "04:56", "of Los Angeles it'll just go straight", "04:58", "through la look at this what is that", "05:02", "from Jamie", "05:02", "or a five fire yeah okay oh that's it", "05:06", "that's the crazy video so this is Bel", "05:08", "Air on the left-hand side yeah and so", "05:10", "these are people driving down the 405", "05:12", "looking at you know the most insane site", "05:16", "for a place that has 30 million people", "05:19", "or whatever la has to see the entire", "05:22", "hillside on fire and Bel Air up to me", "05:24", "Bel Air is really interesting because", "05:26", "it's you know most climate impacts they", "05:27", "hit the world's poorest first and like", "05:30", "the wildfires are they work in the", "05:32", "reverse because it's like people living", "05:33", "in the hills yeah those are the rich", "05:35", "people but it just shows you like no", "05:37", "matter how rich you are no matter how", "05:39", "comforted by that wealth you are like", "05:41", "you know you might get hit well the best", "05:44", "example was Point Dume yeah and we were", "05:48", "flying over it my friend bill has a", "05:50", "helicopter license and so we went around", "05:53", "the peak of Point Dume it's crazy", "05:56", "because you know these are like 20", "05:58", "million dollar states these massive", "06:01", "Bluffs ID homes they thought they were", "06:04", "living in the peak of luxury over", "06:06", "viewing the ocean and like wow we're on", "06:08", "top of the world and the fire just", "06:10", "scorched it to the ground like that's", "06:12", "what it looks like now yeah", "06:14", "well it's really crazy cuz you're like", "06:16", "they couldn't even because people voice", "06:17", "at all well they'll protect the rich", "06:19", "folks they didn't protect these ones", "06:20", "yeah I think they can't protect anybody", "06:22", "when it gets this crazy the I think they", "06:24", "lost more than six hundred homes in", "06:25", "Malibu alone yeah I mean and that's I", "06:28", "mean yeah and you think about Miami", "06:30", "Beach going underwater and right and", "06:32", "it's well Miami Beach is a weird one", "06:33", "right because the the ground is porous", "06:35", "yeah", "06:36", "yeah so it's inevitable I'm gonna get", "06:38", "out of there there's basically a sandbar", "06:40", "that", "06:40", "some developers and xx decided that was", "06:42", "oh we can make this into a fake paradise", "06:44", "oh really", "06:45", "yeah I mean there was yeah I was um I", "06:47", "mean la is kind of the same way like", "06:48", "nobody looking at la in 1850 would have", "06:50", "said like here's a great place to build", "06:51", "a city right but we did it anyway like", "06:54", "America and it's like Imperial swagger", "06:56", "was like no we can create some paradise", "06:58", "out of this completely inhospitable land", "06:59", "in both places and then you know it's", "07:01", "just a lesson that like you know it's", "07:04", "just a matter of time well the most", "07:05", "cocky people are the people that have", "07:06", "those houses on stilts on the water yeah", "07:09", "in Malibu yeah how long is this gonna", "07:12", "work out for you yeah like this thing", "07:14", "moves back and forth over time and it", "07:16", "has forever I mean if you think about", "07:18", "like the long long sweep of human", "07:19", "history most human settlements didn't", "07:21", "happen on the coast right like people", "07:24", "lived in maybe they live on a river", "07:25", "maybe you have like a little community", "07:27", "on the river but the you know the last", "07:28", "like 50 years we were a hundred years", "07:30", "we've built up so especially in America", "07:32", "so much more on the coast and that's", "07:33", "like you know really inviting disaster I", "07:36", "mean all of Houston like all of that is", "07:38", "like that was flood plain that like", "07:40", "nature was like you know a swampland it", "07:42", "was and now it's you know new suburban", "07:44", "developments made out of concrete and", "07:46", "that just means more more flooding yeah", "07:47", "I've been to Houston right after floods", "07:50", "and it's Houston is a crazy one they we", "07:53", "lot there was a hotel lobbies to stay at", "07:54", "whenever I used to do gigs in Houston", "07:56", "it's gone now because though the", "07:58", "floodwaters just filled up the hotel so", "08:01", "crazy", "08:01", "I actually really love that city it's", "08:04", "kind of like a this great food oh yeah", "08:06", "Houston's super underrated exit to it", "08:09", "gets lumped into this weird sort of San", "08:11", "Antonio vibe I don't know why but I'm a", "08:15", "big fan of Houston I'm a big fan of", "08:16", "Texas in general they're fun people yeah", "08:18", "but yeah if it gets hotter they're", "08:20", "fucked too cuz it's just like in the", "08:22", "summertime in Houston you know when", "08:24", "you're dealing with 100 percent humidity", "08:25", "and it's 115 degrees outside", "08:27", "you can't even explain to people what", "08:29", "that feels like I mean even cooked", "08:31", "there's their places in the world that", "08:33", "are gonna be they're gonna literally", "08:35", "cook you by 2050 so cities in India and", "08:37", "the Middle East you won't be able to go", "08:39", "outside during the summer without ever", "08:42", "being a risk of dying by 2050 by 2050", "08:45", "like what kind of temperature we're", "08:46", "talking about well it's a combination of", "08:47", "heat and humidity so but you know", "08:48", "usually the heat will be like up in the", "08:50", "up around 130 combined with some bad", "08:52", "humidity", "08:54", "but you know they've already been we've", "08:55", "already broken that threshold like", "08:57", "they're been temperature records set", "08:58", "every year but last year broke 113 OMA", "09:01", "on I think but like the scarier parts", "09:03", "are not some of these crazy desert", "09:05", "places that have gotten really hot it's", "09:06", "that the cities like Calcutta has like", "09:08", "12 million people in it and you may not", "09:11", "be able to you may not be able to live", "09:12", "there in the summer in just 30 years", "09:14", "mm-hmm", "09:16", "and then you think about where all those", "09:17", "people are going and how much that's", "09:18", "going to destabilize everything you know", "09:20", "I've talked to people who are terrified", "09:24", "about this and I've talked to people who", "09:25", "are nonchalant where where do you sit", "09:28", "are you terrified you thinking that", "09:31", "you're going to be physically in trouble", "09:33", "yourself or do you think that with", "09:35", "proper planning and just not being tied", "09:38", "to one spot you can move to another area", "09:40", "I mean I have I have different feelings", "09:42", "about it at different times a day", "09:43", "because it's that big a story it's like", "09:45", "gonna affect everything I think you know", "09:47", "I think civilization is not going to", "09:49", "collapse I think like there'll be people", "09:51", "around even living like kind of", "09:52", "rewarding prosperous lives forever and", "09:56", "the question is like what shape those", "09:59", "lives take and where they're where they", "10:01", "are so me personally you know unlike a", "10:04", "relatively well-off person who lives in", "10:06", "America in you know New York I think", "10:10", "I'll be able to do ok I think my", "10:13", "children will be able to do okay and", "10:14", "when I imagine their future I think it's", "10:17", "a reflection of all of our kind of like", "10:19", "cognitive biases and emotional reflexes", "10:21", "that when I imagine like my daughter's", "10:23", "future I'm imagining a world that seems", "10:25", "a lot like the one that we live in today", "10:27", "mm-hmm but when I look at the science it", "10:29", "paints a really really bleak picture so", "10:31", "you know the question of like optimism", "10:34", "and alarm I think it's really all a", "10:36", "matter of perspective right so we're at", "10:38", "one point one degree Celsius right now I", "10:40", "think there's basically no way that we", "10:42", "avoid two degrees of warming which is", "10:44", "like this UN calls catastrophic warming", "10:48", "the island nations of the world call", "10:50", "genocide and that's when we would be", "10:53", "making these cities in the Middle East", "10:54", "unlivable it would mean like some ice", "10:56", "sheets would start a permanent collapse", "10:57", "which could all of the melted eventually", "11:00", "bring 260 feet of sea-level rise and", "11:02", "we're on track for four degrees of", "11:04", "warming so that would mean", "11:06", "hundred trillion dollars and climate", "11:09", "damages by the end of the century that's", "11:11", "twice as much wealth as exist in the", "11:12", "world today it would mean there be parts", "11:14", "of the world scientists say where you", "11:16", "could be hit by six simultaneous climate", "11:19", "disasters at once there be at least a", "11:22", "few hundred climate refugees the UN says", "11:24", "the low-end estimate is 200 million the", "11:26", "high-end estimate is a billion which as", "11:28", "many people as live in North and South", "11:30", "America comprised opulence yes six", "11:32", "simultaneous natural disasters at once", "11:34", "yeah what does that mean like flooding", "11:36", "hurricane famine you know some public", "11:41", "health issue um like malaria it's like", "11:45", "every every category of modern life can", "11:47", "be affected by this and there aren't", "11:49", "that many that could be hit by six but", "11:51", "like already right now in Australia", "11:53", "there is a crazy heatwave it's like over", "11:55", "120 and lots of Australia they're also", "11:57", "dealing with like epic floods in other", "11:59", "parts of the country and that's kind of", "12:02", "the problem actually with wildfires in", "12:03", "California it's not just that it's", "12:04", "getting hotter is that it's also getting", "12:06", "wetter so the more rain means more", "12:08", "growth means when it gets hot again that", "12:11", "growth gets baked and then becomes you", "12:13", "know firestarter mmm and that's the you", "12:16", "know it's not just it's not just a", "12:17", "temperature it's like higher", "12:19", "temperatures mean crazier extremes in", "12:21", "all directions and you know that's why I", "12:25", "think sort of looking big-picture", "12:27", "there's not a life on Earth that's gonna", "12:30", "be untouched by this force like over the", "12:33", "decades ahead but that's not to say that", "12:35", "we're all be destroyed by it either I", "12:36", "think like we will find ways to live and", "12:38", "adapt and mitigate it's just a question", "12:41", "of how much it's gonna screw up our", "12:43", "politics how much it's gonna change the", "12:44", "way we think of history you know like", "12:47", "I'm an end of I'm a 90s kid I grew up", "12:49", "end of history thinking the world was", "12:50", "gonna get better the world was gonna get", "12:51", "richer globalization was progress etc", "12:54", "what does it mean if like climate change", "12:56", "completely eliminates the possibility of", "12:58", "economic growth which probably won't be", "13:00", "the case for the u.s. but there are huge", "13:01", "parts of the world where that is going", "13:03", "to be the case if we don't change course", "13:04", "now so like at the end of the century if", "13:06", "we don't change course the economist", "13:08", "studying this say global GDP could be at", "13:11", "least 20 possibly 30 percent smaller", "13:13", "than it would be without climate change", "13:14", "30 percent is twice as big an impact as", "13:17", "the Great Depression how did you get", "13:18", "involved in this how'd you get involved", "13:20", "studying this and what was your", "13:21", "perception before you got involved and", "13:23", "how did it shift so I'm a journalist I'm", "13:25", "an editor mostly actually at New York", "13:27", "Magazine and you know I'm interested in", "13:30", "the near future like as a result read a", "13:32", "lot of scientific papers read a lot of", "13:34", "like obscure subreddits and that kind of", "13:36", "thing and um just in 2016 started seeing", "13:40", "a lot more of that a lot more of the", "13:42", "news from science was about climate and", "13:44", "a lot more of that climate news was", "13:45", "really scary and when I looked around at", "13:47", "the other places that like we think of", "13:49", "as our competitors you know newspapers", "13:50", "TV shows I just felt like the scarier", "13:54", "end of the spectrum was just not at all", "13:55", "being talked about so most scientists", "13:58", "talked about this two degree threshold", "13:59", "is like the threshold of catastrophe and", "14:01", "I think most laypeople think that that", "14:04", "means that that's kind of a ceiling for", "14:05", "warming like that'll be the worst that", "14:07", "could get but actually it's functionally", "14:09", "the best case scenario and yet we hadn't", "14:12", "had any storytelling any discussion", "14:14", "around what the world would look like", "14:15", "north of two degrees and I just felt as", "14:17", "a journalist I was like holy shit", "14:19", "there's a huge story here like the way", "14:21", "that this world could be completely", "14:23", "transformed by these forces is not", "14:26", "something that anybody's writing about", "14:27", "in parkas it's a long story but", "14:29", "scientists and science journalists were", "14:31", "really they were really focused on", "14:33", "making sure that their messaging was", "14:35", "hopeful and optimistic and they were", "14:36", "reluctant to talk about them scariest", "14:38", "findings and so I was terrified by the", "14:42", "science I looked at it and I was like", "14:43", "nobody's talking about this as scary", "14:45", "gotta like spread the word and I wrote a", "14:48", "big piece in 2017 that was very focused", "14:51", "on worst-case scenarios so I mentioned", "14:53", "before I think 2 degrees is about our", "14:55", "best-case scenario 4 degrees is where", "14:57", "we're on track 4 now this piece was", "14:58", "looking at five six eight degrees of", "15:00", "warming so things were not likely to get", "15:01", "this century at least and it was a huge", "15:03", "phenomenon it was read by a bunch of", "15:06", "million people the biggest story that", "15:07", "New York magazine had ever published and", "15:09", "I just thought man I guess there are a", "15:11", "lot of people like me out there who had", "15:13", "intuitions about climate suffering and", "15:17", "terror but aren't seeing it in the way", "15:20", "people are writing about the story so I", "15:22", "decided you know there's there's more to", "15:25", "say and even beyond like telling the the", "15:28", "bleak storytelling that really dark", "15:30", "talking about the really dark", "15:32", "possibilities I just thought", "15:33", "there are all these categories of life", "15:35", "that we haven't even thought about how", "15:37", "they'll impact so we we know about sea", "15:39", "level rise but that's like as I", "15:41", "mentioned before that makes you think if", "15:43", "you live off the coast you'll be okay", "15:45", "but the whole planet is gonna be touched", "15:47", "by this some places are going to be hip", "15:48",

fine we're gonna be fine that kind", "25:18", "of thing is that that is an issue", "25:20", "correct totally yeah there was um there", "25:22", "was a really famous book in the middle", "25:23", "of the 20th century called the", "25:24", "Population Bomb", "25:25", "so this is a guy named Paul Ehrlich", "25:26", "Ehrlich um who he was like you know the", "25:30", "world just cannot support this many", "25:33", "people like if we get to eight billion", "25:35", "people there just won't be enough food", "25:36", "there won't be you know that the planet", "25:38", "can't sustain that and he's often", "25:40", "pointed to is this sort of like prophet", "25:42", "of doomsday that and his prophecy", "25:44", "totally didn't work out because we had", "25:46", "this thing that's called the

"25:57", "figure our way out of foxholes all the", "25:58", "time yeah but that revolution was", "26:02", "literally like one dude Norman Borlaug", "26:05", "who figured out how to grow crops", "26:07", "differently in one guy one set of", "26:10", "innovations and he completely", "26:11", "transformed the whole fate of the planet", "26:13", "what did he do he just basically did", "26:15", "like genetically modified crops before", "26:18", "like the you know before the name it was", "26:21", "like um he's the Golden Rice guy yeah", "26:24", "okay yeah and and you know the whole", "26:27", "developing world benefitted enormously", "26:29", "and you're still seeing that today like", "26:31", "we see all these charts that you know so", "26:34", "much less poverty so much less infant", "26:35", "mortality and in developing world and", "26:37", "that's great that's like incredible", "26:38", "progress but a lot of that has", "26:41", "was powered by the industrialization of", "26:43", "those countries so that bill is gonna", "26:45", "come due going forward and you know I", "26:50", "think like when you look at climate", "26:51", "change you know if it was just one", "26:54", "threat like let's take our culture since", "26:56", "we're talking about agriculture", "26:58", "estimates say that if we continue on the", "27:00", "path we're on by the end of the century", "27:02", "grain yields would be half as productive", "27:05", "as they are today just by the", "27:08", "temperature effect so we'd have just as", "27:10", "much land just as much grain crops as we", "27:13", "have now but the food we get from it", "27:15", "we'd only get half as much as we get", "27:16", "today what's the cause of that it's just", "27:19", "the temperature affects play us the", "27:21", "temperature alone yeah Wow I mean there", "27:23", "are other impacts too on food like", "27:25", "insects there's you know hydro", "27:27", "temperatures means more insects which is", "27:28", "bad for crops the carbon has a", "27:30", "complicated relationship to crop growth", "27:32", "like in some plants grow bread better", "27:34", "with more carbon but actually they're", "27:36", "like the weeds and the ones that we like", "27:38", "to eat don't grow better with more", "27:39", "carbon and you know by the end of the", "27:42", "century so we could have half as much", "27:43", "grain and we could have 50% more people", "27:46", "than we have right now now there's a way", "27:48", "you could imagine oh well like maybe", "27:50", "there'll be another Norman

can imagine", "30:01", "agriculture getting figured out but when", "30:03", "you see just how many impacts there are", "30:05", "it's like it's everywhere everything", "30:08", "will be changed and it

you deal", "30:33", "with the right you refugees food I mean", "30:35", "it's it's it's so all-encompassing and I", "30:38", "think that's another reason why we don't", "30:40", "want to look at it

think", "32:25", "most scientists would say it isn't but I", "32:27", "also think if what we're seeing is", "32:29", "natural warming that should terrify us", "32:31", "even more because it would mean

it should be a", "32:40", "comfort that we're doing it because that", "32:42", "means we can stop doing it right well it", "32:44", "should be a comfort that there's people", "32:46", "smarter than the people that don't think", "32:47", "that we're doing it that there are", "32:49", "people that can possibly consider some", "32:52", "sort of way to mitigate this yeah and", "32:54", "what what are the what are the ways of", "32:56", "being proposed and how seriously are", "32:58", "they're being taken other than this the", "33:00", "idea of building these machines to", "33:02", "extract carbon in the atmosphere I'm", "33:03", "sure you're probably aware of there's", "33:06", "some of the programs that they've talked", "33:07", "about were suspending reflective", "33:10", "particles in the atmosphere to minimize", "33:13", "the amount of solar radiation we receive", "33:15", "yeah so it's interesting this guy who I", "33:16", "mentioned earlier who's", "33:18", "done the most the sort of most", "33:19", "innovative carbon capture machine I", "33:21", "talked to him a few weeks ago and he was", "33:24", "like no no no but we shouldn't be using", "33:26", "carbon capture we should be doing solar", "33:27", "geoengineering which is what you're", "33:28", "talking about and that means probably", "33:31", "suspending sulfur is like the most", "33:33", "useful thing in the atmosphere I'm great", "33:35", "we're gonna smell like sulfur no this", "33:37", "not the sky would get red out Jesus", "33:39", "there are all of these aesthetic effects", "33:41", "to which nobody talks about so like", "33:42", "trees are gonna just turn immediately", "33:43", "Brown I'm not gonna turn color there was", "33:46", "a study a couple weeks ago that the", "33:47", "oceans are gonna change color there this", "33:49", "is if we do that we suspend no no this", "33:51", "is just your warming just from warming", "33:52", "the oceans gonna change power to what", "33:54", "yeah I think just from more green to", "33:56", "more blue but be nice yeah", "33:59", "but yes the sulfur thing is I so we", "34:02", "could you know we could suspend these", "34:04", "basically an umbrella of sulfur around", "34:07", "in the atmosphere which would mean that", "34:09", "it would some of the sunlight coming to", "34:11", "the earth would be reflected back into", "34:12", "the atmosphere and that would mean that", "34:14", "the Sun would absorb less sunlight I", "34:16", "mean there would absorb less on sunlight", "34:18", "which would make it a little bit cooler", "34:20", "the problem is that would have some", "34:23", "crippling impacts on agriculture and we", "34:26", "basically don't know other side effects", "34:28", "that would have and how would you take", "34:30", "that stuff out well you could just stop", "34:33", "doing it it has a shelf life of I don't", "34:35", "know what it is ten years so you could", "34:36", "just stop doing it and that's a big", "34:37", "concern actually because if we did that", "34:39", "just to mask the amount of global", "34:41", "warming that we were doing then whatever", "34:44", "program was responsible for it would be", "34:46", "really vulnerable to terrorism to war", "34:49", "because if we if we were if the planet", "34:53", "were functionally warmed say five", "34:56", "degrees but we were suspending enough", "34:57", "sulfur that it was actually only two", "34:59", "degrees warmer then if we just for", "35:02", "instance like somebody bombed the", "35:03", "facility that was doing it the planet", "35:05", "would be immediately tripped into a much", "35:07", "much hotter State and that would be", "35:10", "completely catastrophic even more", "35:11", "catastrophic than a more slow approach", "35:14", "to five degrees because we would just do", "35:15", "it we over a century or several", "35:17", "centuries we met in ways we'd be able to", "35:19", "adjust to sort of was it with you in", "35:20", "immediate you know why sulfur I think", "35:24", "it's just something about the particular", "35:25", "characteristic of it I don't know", "35:27", "wouldn't it smell her I mean would", "35:28", "literally be like hell like that's what", "35:30", "you yeah", "35:31", "always hear about with the horror movies", "35:33", "right the devil smells like sulfur yeah", "35:34", "and I mean it's the it's what farts", "35:37", "smell like yeah and the reason that we", "35:39", "were the reason we're able to smell", "35:40", "farts is because sulfur is also I mean", "35:43", "some related compounds hydrogen sulfide", "35:46", "are are really toxic and so that brings", "35:50", "me to methane that's another issue as", "35:52", "well right yeah the cows producing", "35:54", "methane gas yeah a large-scale", "35:56", "agricultural yeah wait let me just say", "35:58", "one more thing about the solar", "36:00", "geoengineering so the thing about that", "36:02", "that's real this sounds horrifying this", "36:03", "program people are excited about it is", "36:05", "really cheap it's way cheaper than", "36:06", "carbon capture and but so there's a", "36:09", "positive for it but it's also we are", "36:14", "basically already doing this so we have", "36:16", "what's called small particulate", "36:17", "pollution that's or aerosol pollution um", "36:21", "stuff to spend the name in the", "36:22", "atmosphere that's why like Delhi is", "36:24", "really hard to breathe in because we", "36:25", "have a lot of particulate in the", "36:26", "atmosphere that is already suppressing", "36:30", "global temperatures by as much as a half", "36:31", "degree or maybe one degree which means", "36:34", "and that's the reason that those 9", "36:35", "million people are dying every year from", "36:36", "air pollution so if we solve that", "36:38", "problem if we solve the air pollution", "36:40", "problem save those 9 million lives we", "36:42", "every year we would immediately make the", "36:44", "planet at least a half a degree warmer", "36:46", "and possibly one degree warmer which", "36:47", "would put us at the threshold of", "36:49", "catastrophe or above it so we're sort of", "36:52", "already doing this program just not in a", "36:54", "systematic way we're doing it in a", "36:55", "haphazard way the methane you mentioned", "36:58", "they're basically two big issues with", "36:59", "methane", "36:59", "the first is cows", "37:03", "so yeah cows produced a ton of methane", "37:06", "which is depending on how you count", "37:07", "about 35 or maybe eighty five times", "37:10", "stronger a greenhouse gas than carbon", "37:12", "whoa yeah it's really intense but", "37:16", "they're also these like small-scale", "37:17", "studies that show if we feed cattle just", "37:19", "a little bit of seaweed they're methane", "37:21", "emissions could fall by 95 or 99 percent", "37:23", "so we could if if that was scaleable", "37:26", "which is not clear it is but if it was", "37:28", "we could immediately eliminate the", "37:30", "entire carbon footprint of beef which", "37:32", "people talk about a lot now that's", "37:33", "incredible", "37:34", "yeah just it's a reminder to me that", "37:36", "like you know you get told all you", "37:37", "should eat less hamburgers or whatever", "37:39", "but obviously this is like a problem", "37:40", "that's too big to be solved with like", "37:42", "individual choices we need some kind of", "37:43", "global", "37:44", "policy or national policy about it but", "37:46", "the scarier methane issue is um there's", "37:49", "all this carbon stored in frozen", "37:52", "permafrost in the northern latitudes", "37:54", "that permafrost is melting and when it", "37:57", "melts that carbon will be released into", "37:59", "the atmosphere we don't know the", "38:00", "proportion that it will be released as", "38:03", "carbon dioxide versus methane but there", "38:06", "is in that permafrost twice as much", "38:08", "carbon as now exists in the atmosphere", "38:10", "which means if it were all released", "38:13", "possibly in a relatively sudden way it", "38:15", "could make our carbon problem", "38:17", "immediately three times worse and it", "38:20", "could be even the effect could even be", "38:22", "more dramatic than that if it was", "38:23", "released mostly as methane because", "38:24", "methane is a stronger greenhouse gas", "38:26", "most scientists think that that's not", "38:28", "something that we need to freak out", "38:29", "about in the short term but it's there", "38:31", "it is melting and methane is being", "38:33", "released at some rate so craziest", "38:35", "solution that I ever heard for that one", "38:38", "was to bring back the woolly mammoth", "38:40", "yeah yeah they're trying to do that yeah", "38:43", "and the idea that the woolly mammoth is", "38:45", "gonna save us all by releasing them", "38:47", "throughout Siberia yeah that's crazy", "38:50", "right I mean I think that we're gonna", "38:52", "have a whole a century of shit like that", "38:54", "and shit like cows eating seaweed that", "38:58", "everything you know we'll have our", "39:00", "global politics will be reoriented", "39:02", "around climate change so that you'll", "39:04", "start to see sanctions put against", "39:05", "nations that are behaving badly MBS the", "39:09", "guy who's you know that like kind of", "39:11", "thug who's running Saudi Arabia now says", "39:12", "he needs Saudi Arabia's economy to be", "39:14", "totally off oil by 2050 and I think", "39:17", "that's because he knows that you know", "39:19", "the global community will not tolerate", "39:20", "someone producing more oil and as", "39:24", "recently as it you know as soon as a few", "39:26", "decades from now but the impacts are you", "39:28", "know everywhere so that like yeah like", "39:31", "in California now you can you know", "39:33", "during wildfire season you can buy masks", "39:36", "to you know to shield yourself from the", "39:39", "smoke which is really really damaging", "39:40", "its effects on cognitive performance are", "39:42", "really dramatic can lower cognitive", "39:44", "performance by like 10 to 15 percent its", "39:46", "effect on the development of kids is", "39:48", "really dramatic there was an incredible", "39:51", "study a few years ago where if you", "39:53", "looked at places where they Institute it", "39:56", "easy but you have easy pass out here in", "39:57", "California", "39:57", "no we don't we don't have tolls all", "40:00", "right it's so amazing yeah I think one", "40:04", "or two places yeah but like depending on", "40:05", "where you lived you'd have to take that", "40:07", "every day dude in New York the river", "40:08", "right now I know to me I like that okay", "40:10", "so it used to be the case that cars had", "40:12", "to like slow down and pay a toll yeah", "40:14", "and because they were slowing down", "40:15", "they're producing more exhaust when they", "40:17", "instituted EZ Pass cars could just drive", "40:19", "through right and that meant they", "40:20", "produce less exhaust and the effect on", "40:22", "the unpremeditated these new easy passed", "40:27", "toll plazas it reduced them by like 15%", "40:29", "each that's how dramatic just the", "40:31", "exhaust effect is on development of", "40:33", "babies how much is an effect of electric", "40:37", "cars yeah that can I mean that that will", "40:39", "be right now it hasn't had enough of an", "40:41", "effect because there's not enough of", "40:43", "them yeah and but yeah I mean the that", "40:47", "problem on that unlike the technological", "40:50", "level has been solved we know how to", "40:52", "replace cars with electric cars we can", "40:54", "make them even pretty affordable not", "40:56", "quite as affordable as they need to be", "40:57", "but the new Tesla's are like 35 grand I", "40:59", "think if you get it down to 15 grands", "41:02", "that'll be you know that'll be a huge", "41:04", "solution but then there are a lot of", "41:05", "other problems that are more difficult", "41:06", "like air travel yeah we don't have", "41:09", "electric planes around the corner you", "41:11", "can't fly planes is there anything like", "41:13", "that on the horizon there are some", "41:15", "people who are trying to develop it but", "41:17", "it seems like probably it's at least", "41:18", "like a decade away and you know one", "41:21", "cross-country flight in the u.s. is the", "41:23", "equivalent one seat on one Costco", "41:26", "cross-country flight is the equivalent", "41:27", "of eight months of driving every time", "41:29", "you fly from New York to London and back", "41:31", "you melt 9 3 square meters of ice every", "41:35", "single seat on every flight from New", "41:37", "York to London melts 3 square meters of", "41:40", "ice of Arctic assets yeah", "41:43", "that's insane that's real yeah yeah I", "41:49", "think it's hairy at the time you fly", "41:50", "across the country it's like eight", "41:52", "months of driving yeah whoa so globally", "41:56", "air travel is only 2% of the carbon", "41:58", "footprint so it's relatively small but", "42:00", "for people in especially rich people in", "42:03", "rich countries it's a much bigger part", "42:04", "of the focus they fly around all yes but", "42:07", "yeah I know the average American I think", "42:08", "the stat is the average American every", "42:10", "year Amit", "42:11", "enough carbon to melt 10,000 tons of ice", "42:16", "Jesus Christ that's just the average", "42:19", "American and if you're a person like me", "42:23", "who flies like every other weekend it's", "42:26", "way worse way worse yeah oh so holy shit", "42:33", "you put in that perspective it's how", "42:36", "much fuckin eyes is there I mean there's", "42:38", "a lot of ice yeah but it's gonna melt", "42:40", "well that's how you get you know the out", "42:42", "the outside projections the high-end", "42:44", "projections for sea level rise are 260", "42:46", "feet no the the plus sign is it's way", "42:50", "better to get hotter than it is to get", "42:53", "colder right like I say just kill", "42:55", "everything well the you know the each of", "42:57", "the so they've been five mass", "42:58", "extinctions in planetary history in the", "43:00", "Earth's history before one of them was", "43:02", "killed was caused by an asteroid but the", "43:04", "other four were were produced by global", "43:07", "warming related to greenhouse gas and", "43:11", "one of them the Ice Age well the ice age", "43:13", "doesn't count it didn't didn't kill as", "43:15", "many no really the the biggest mass", "43:18", "extinction the end-permian extinction", "43:20", "which is 252 million years ago 90 to 95", "43:24", "percent of all life on Earth died when", "43:28", "was that 252 million years so each of", "43:31", "these mass extinctions basically is like", "43:33", "a complete slate wiping of the", "43:35", "evolutionary record it's like we're", "43:36", "starting over from scratch so we want to", "43:38", "think that the the asteroid that hit the", "43:40", "Yucatan did the most damage in terms of", "43:42", "the fossil record is that not true is", "43:44", "the one that was the the global warming", "43:46", "was that more well there's so they're", "43:47", "five and four of them were from global", "43:49", "warming and the worst the worst one was", "43:51", "just from from greenhouse gas warming", "43:53", "but yeah the one that killed the", "43:55", "dinosaurs was also really bad it was", "43:56", "something like 70% of all life on but", "43:58", "it's less than the one where there was a", "44:00", "temperature rise yeah Wow", "44:02", "there was a volcano this is a little bit", "44:04", "sketchy science but there was a volcano", "44:05", "explosion something like thirty thousand", "44:10", "years ago or something I don't remember", "44:11", "the exact dates but that volcanoes can", "44:15", "cool a global temperature for the same", "44:16", "reason we're talking about with", "44:17", "suspending particles because it", "44:18", "basically clouds the atmosphere with and", "44:20", "it dropped global temperatures I think", "44:22", "it was two degrees and the human popular", "44:25", "at the time then shrunk to 7,000 there's", "44:28", "a bunch of times that's less people", "44:31", "didn't live on Nantucket and it just it", "44:35", "just makes you see like everything about", "44:37", "the way that we live on this planet is", "44:39", "dependent on climate conditions", "44:40", "yeah like we'll figure a way to like", "44:43", "have a civilization but it will be", "44:45", "transformed it will be very different if", "44:46", "the world is four degrees warmer um and", "44:49", "you know everything about the way that", "44:53", "we take for everything we take for", "44:54", "granted today is like a permanent", "44:55", "feature of the modern world I think", "44:58", "we're going to learn is much more", "45:00", "precarious much more unstable and yeah", "45:04", "like I said earlier you know climates", "45:07", "were stable for all of human history", "45:08", "that's how we were able to evolve it's", "45:10", "how we were able to invent agriculture", "45:12", "the part of the world where we did", "45:14", "invent agriculture the Middle East it's", "45:15", "now getting almost too hot to grow crops", "45:17", "it's also gonna be too hot to go to", "45:19", "Mecca for a pilgrimage in just a couple", "45:21", "decades weather like we're entirely", "45:24", "outside of that window of temperatures", "45:27", "which means we're functionally now", "45:29", "living on an entirely different planet", "45:30", "than humans ever lived on before and", "45:32", "it's going to keep changing so by the", "45:34", "time we get to two or three or four", "45:36",

"of people but it was also very widely", "46:00", "dismissed by a lot of other people as", "46:01", "well how accurate was that movie I think", "46:03", "it proved to be too sanguine it like it",

faster than", "47:14", "scientists predicted even a decade or", "47:16", "two ago and so I think the first thing", "47:18", "can mean in truth is a little too", "47:19", "complacent but Al Gore is also you know", "47:22", "I know him a little bit I've talked to", "47:24", "him a few times he's um temperamentally", "47:26", "he's a technocrat he's an optimist", "47:29", "he thinks market forces

figure it out", "53:20", "in this way we'll figure it out in that", "53:21", "way but the UN says we need to have all", "53:24", "of our global emissions by 2030 to have", "53:29", "a chance of

but this category storm was", "59:41", "sandy I think it made landfall as a", "59:43", "category three so it's not even a five", "59:46", "yeah so if a five hitting is it possible", "59:49", "for a five to hit New York is it too far", "59:50", "north", "59:51", "no it's possible totally possible I was", "59:52", "talking to a really prominent climate", "59:54", "scientist a few months ago who is like", "59:56", "one of the he was one of the lead author", "59:58", "on the UN report lives in New York does", "60:02", "a lot of consulting with the city and I", "60:03", "said so we're gonna build a seawall to", "60:06", "protect New York from flooding and he", "60:09", "was like oh absolutely you know", "60:10", "Manhattan real estate it's way too", "60:11", "expensive", "60:12", "to let flood so we'll definitely build a", "60:14", "seawall but an infrastructure project", "60:16", "like that takes at least 30 years to", "60:19", "build and if we started right now we", "60:22", "wouldn't be able to finish in time to", "60:24", "save Howard Beach in parts of Brooklyn", "60:26", "and Queens if we started right now he", "60:29", "said he said the city knows this and", "60:32", "you'll see in the next few years they'll", "60:34", "stop doing repairs on infrastructure", "60:36", "they'll stop attending to the subway", "60:39", "lines in those neighborhoods and even a", "60:41", "few years after that they'll start", "60:42", "staying explicitly to the people who", "60:43", "live there you might be able to continue", "60:45", "living in these homes for a couple", "60:47", "decades but you're not going to be able", "60:48", "to live them leave them to your kids", "60:50", "whoa this is in New York City it's like", "60:53", "the richest country in the world and", "60:56", "yeah huge parts of huge parts of", "60:59", "southern Brooklyn and Queens are going", "61:01", "to be underwater so for the people that", "61:03", "live there right now what parts are you", "61:05", "talking about well the one that the one", "61:07", "that he mentioned most explicitly was", "61:09", "Howard Beach but which is its kind of an", "61:11", "inch it's like a mob neighborhood and", "61:13", "you know it's still yeah really well", "61:15", "yeah yeah see because that was like the", "61:19", "gaudy neighborhood right yeah that's", "61:20", "where they buried all about dead bodies", "61:21", "Wow I didn't know that was still a mob", "61:24", "neighborhood well you know to the extent", "61:26", "that there is a mob yeah and yeah I mean", "61:31", "that's true everywhere on the coast", "61:33", "everywhere it's not just New York New", "61:35", "York is not exceptional right you know", "61:37", "their projections that like 30 billion", "61:39", "dollars of New Jersey real estate could", "61:41", "be underwater by 2030 2035 is alarming I", "61:48", "was born in New Jersey yeah it's not as", "61:51", "alarming and then you know Miami Beach", "61:52", "is you know Miami Beach is done for yeah", "61:54", "Miami Beach is almost inevitable correct", "61:57", "yeah yeah I mean you know they could", "61:59", "they could build a seawall but that", "62:01", "doesn't help because of the ground right", "62:03", "and and it's just so expensive so you", "62:05", "really have to you really have to pick", "62:07", "your poison and then when you look", "62:09", "around the world you know", "62:11", "it's like Bangladesh that country is", "62:13", "gonna be almost entirely underwater", "62:15", "that's hundreds of millions of people if", "62:18", "we want it to build a seawall they can't", "62:21", "afford that", "62:21", "who's gonna afford who's gonna pay for", "62:23", "that and this is all because of the", "62:25", "raising sea level because of the melting", "62:28", "ice because of the temperature and all", "62:30", "this is happening and I think you know", "62:31", "we think of sea level is really a thing", "62:33", "that happens on the coastline which it", "62:34", "is primarily but it also increases", "62:36", "flooding on rivers because the water is", "62:39", "all connected of course", "62:40", "so flooding in the UK is expected to", "62:43", "grow 50 fold by the end of the century", "62:46", "what", "62:46", "well that life default London is already", "62:49", "like under water a couple times a year I", "62:51", "mean not the whole city but is this", "62:52", "Jamie this is Bangladesh I just went 200", "62:55", "that's under watch jeez oh my god these", "62:59", "people are fucked", "63:00", "yes there's 18 million residents live", "63:01", "here that's a swamp yeah that looks", "63:04", "crazy like it look if you are a real", "63:06", "estate projector and you're flying over", "63:07", "that yeah yeah yeah we can't build here", "63:09", "yeah Jakarta will be totally underwater", "63:11", "those apartment buildings like you could", "63:13", "see the water level look back up a", "63:14", "little bit this is just a running little", "63:16", "oh but if you see look at like doesn't", "63:19", "that look like a water level and the", "63:20", "apartment buildings on the right-hand", "63:22", "side and your where your cursor is yeah", "63:23", "like like that's gonna go up to where", "63:26", "that orange level is fuckin Christ", "63:29", "well I mean over millenia we're gonna", "63:32", "rise hundreds of feet Oh God I mean it's", "63:35", "gonna take a long time so you can adjust", "63:37", "that a little bit but but that's always", "63:39", "been the case right the the the I mean", "63:41", "they're still fine they find these", "63:45", "artifacts and things in the middle of", "63:47", "the ocean yeah areas where people used", "63:49", "to be able to live and now they can't", "63:51", "live anymore yeah I think that'll be we", "63:54", "have to move people have to move so", "63:56", "what's a good spot Alberta", "63:57", "anyway anywhere anywhere off the Benton", "64:00", "yes the spot now I mean I think I would", "64:02", "like that all the time and I say you", "64:05", "know honestly the place that I would", "64:06", "move to is somewhere in Scandinavia", "64:08", "really because um you know I talked", "64:11", "about the impacts of economic growth", "64:12", "before but they're gonna be parts of the", "64:15", "world that benefit economically from", "64:16", "this anywhere in the north so Canada", "64:18", "Russia and Scandinavia will benefit", "64:20", "because why don't go to Scandinavia go", "64:23", "to candidates right there well that's", "64:24", "look prettier to me yeah skins Navy is", "64:28", "nice but Candace like our neighbors", "64:31", "although they also yeah they have", "64:32", "wildfires there to Canada and that's the", "64:34", "end to in the Arctic Circle in Finland", "64:36", "bears", "64:37", "yeah and outlines but so you know these", "64:40", "guys the economists who study this stuff", "64:42", "say that there is actually an optimal", "64:44", "temperature for human productivity it's", "64:46", "13 degrees Celsius which is the", "64:48", "historical median temperature of the US", "64:49", "it's also the historical median", "64:51", "temperature of Germany what is 13", "64:53", "Celsius was about sixty degrees or", "64:54", "something now yeah I think it's like in", "64:56", "the high 50s all right whenever I'm in", "65:06", "Canada always like I don't know what", "65:08", "you're saying", "65:08", "yeah it's 22 degrees 55 point one and so", "65:13", "for every degree north of that you lose", "65:17", "about a percentage point of GDP so the", "65:19", "u.s. is now at about 13 and a half", "65:22", "degrees Celsius at our median", "65:24", "temperature that means that we're losing", "65:26", "about a half percentage point of GDP", "65:27", "every year from it but there are parts", "65:29", "of the US that were cooler than 13 and", "65:32", "are now brought up to this optimal level", "65:34", "Silicon Valley is like exactly at 13", "65:36", "degrees right now which is you know", "65:38", "notable because they're like super", "65:40", "productive yeah and that's gonna be so", "65:43", "that'll be true for Scandinavian", "65:44", "generally and it may be part of the", "65:46", "explanation why there's been so much", "65:47", "economic productivity in Scandinavia", "65:49", "over the last generation is that they", "65:50", "have already started doing better with", "65:53", "temperature crops are gonna be more", "65:55", "bountiful in Russia like Russia will", "65:56", "have better agriculture

"74:25", "of it but all the new research says like", "74:28", "let's get started right now and we'll", "74:32", "see how that plays out I mean if we", "74:34", "really have to have global emissions by", "74:35", "2030 it means really really aggressive", "74:38", "action which I don't think is possible", "74:40", "but I do think that we'll see much more", "74:42", "aggressive action in the decade ahead", "74:43", "than we've had in the decades in the", "74:45", "past so you think that once there's", "74:47", "financial incentive for people to either", "74:51", "some sort of an industry that reduces", "74:53", "carbon or something along those lines", "74:55", "industries that are working to mitigate", "74:58", "global warming that once there's a", "75:00", "financial sort of benefit for those", "75:02", "people to innovate and to move forward", "75:05", "with this that that's we're going to see", "75:06", "real change", "75:07", "yeah well also that um I mean direct", "75:09", "investment of particular companies but", "75:11", "also you know government leaders who", "75:14", "look around and say if the economic", "75:17", "picture is going to be better ten years", "75:18", "from now if we make massive investments", "75:20", "in green energy then it would be and and", "75:22", "even like past laws you know regulating", "75:27", "say fuel efficiency", "75:29", "or even banning internal combustion", "75:30", "engines which i think will happen within", "75:32", "a couple decades if that's gonna be if", "75:36", "the economic picture taking that path is", "75:38",

"75:47", "quickly and in what form but I do think", "75:51", "that you know I do think the incentives", "75:53", "will be different five years from now", "75:55", "than they looked five years ago and", "75:57", "that'll be that'll be huge so that that", "75:59", "you think would be a great motivator for", "76:01", "people to shift their perceptions and", "76:03", "particularly right-wing folks may be", "76:05", "amongst the 27% that are in denial yeah", "76:08", "well I mean if you look around the world", "76:10", "denial is not really a problem anywhere", "76:11", "but the u.s. there's a little bit of an", "76:13", "in the UK but it's a totally American", "76:15", "phenomenon and when you understand that", "76:17", "the u.s. is only 15 percent of all", "76:18", "global emissions is that's just typical", "76:20", "American arrogance like what do you", "76:22", "think is the the root of that uh I think", "76:25", "it's it's basically bad behavior by the", "76:27", "oil companies", "76:28", "I mean they've like put out really", "76:30", "aggressive disinformation and denial you", "76:33", "ever see the movie merchants of doubt'", "76:35", "yeah yeah perfect example that right", "76:37", "yeah totally yeah and I know that the", "76:40", "people who wrote the book - who are", "76:41", "really really great and you know it's", "76:44", "especially horrifying because in the 60s", "76:47", "and 70s that the oil companies were like", "76:49", "doing some of the most ambitious", "76:50", "research on climate so they're you know", "76:53", "then they ended up suppressing that", "76:55", "going forward but they knew shit about", "76:58", "how the planet was going to change", "76:59", "before any of the rest of us really yes", "77:05", "no alternatives back then and there was", "77:07", "no real emission standard so like this", "77:09", "that's when catalytic converters started", "77:11", "being enacted yeah well you know", "77:12", "somewhere around then if we had started", "77:15", "decarbonization in 2000 which is just", "77:18", "coincidentally was the year that Al Gore", "77:19", "won the popular vote for president we", "77:23", "would have had to globally cut emissions", "77:24", "by about three percent per year to get", "77:26", "below two degrees we're now at a spot", "77:28", "where we have to cut them by about 10", "77:29", "percent per year and if we wait another", "77:31", "decade we're gonna have to cut them by", "77:32", "30 percent per year which is like an", "77:34", "unthinkable rate so we wouldn't have had", "77:37", "to take such aggressive action if we had", "77:39", "started early we would have had to just", "77:41", "be doing", "77:42", "kind of on the margins changes but we're", "77:46", "now in a situation where the problem is", "77:48", "way too big for that and there are", "77:50", "people who want to talk about the", "77:52", "solutions that could have been useful 20", "77:53", "years ago now talking about the carbon", "77:55", "tax is like one quite popular thing to", "77:57", "talk about the UN says that in order to", "78:01", "be effective the carbon a global carbon", "78:02", "tax would need to be

1/100 as high as", "78:12", "that right now and the places in the", "78:14", "world where they do have carbon tax is", "78:15", "everybody's emissions are still grow up", "78:17", "going up so there there was a time when", "78:19", "like the kind of like you don't have to", "78:20", "change anything we'll just like fiddle", "78:22", "on the margins here could have worked if", "78:24", "we had taken if we had really been", "78:25", "focused on it but we're sort of past", "78:27", "that point now unfortunately but it's", "78:30", "interesting you know that the talking", "78:32", "about the oil companies", "78:33", "I think they you know I think they're", "78:35", "responsible for denial but I also think", "78:37", "that denial is not all that important in", "78:39", "American politics because when you look", "78:41", "around the world you see many countries", "78:42", "which very with very different politics", "78:44", "even quite universally focused on", "78:48", "climate issues who are not behaving any", "78:50", "better when it comes to carbon than we", "78:51", "are and so you think well what is the", "78:53", "sickness here is that the Republican", "78:55", "Party and their climate denial or is it", "78:57", "the fact that all of us just want you", "78:59", "know more better cheaper stuff and we", "79:03", "have a really hard time conceiving of", "79:05",

it's", "79:55", "not that", "79:56", "but it's possible there are also other", "79:58", "lawsuits that are happening that are", "79:59", "really interesting there's one in the", "80:01", "Netherlands that some people held the", "80:05", "Dutch government it basically the Dutch", "80:07", "government was not honoring the Paris", "80:08", "Accords and citizens sued to hold them", "80:11", "to that

just seems ridiculous yeah well I", "83:06", "mean I think maybe maybe it'll just be", "83:08", "you can only have an electric car hmm", "83:10", "you know maybe 10 years from now like", "83:12",

that work that", "89:02", "we need to avert by space exploration", "89:04", "that's a timescale of millennia yes we", "89:08", "have a lot of new technology to develop", "89:09", "over the next thousand years that will", "89:11", "allow us to do it better and more", "89:12", "efficiently but climate change the time", "89:14", "scale is like the next 30 years right so", "89:16", "we need to focus on it now know to give", "89:18", "ourselves the opportunity to do the", "89:19", "other show why do you think it's sexier", "89:21", "to go to space is that what it is like", "89:22", "rockets and I mean I think for these", "89:25", "dudes yeah yeah it's a big metal dick", "89:28", "yeah I didn't often the atmosphere", "89:29", "that's what we're doing I've had a fuck", "89:30", "space I actually made that argument", "89:33", "about Mars yeah it's like they're shaped", "89:36", "like dicks yeah something to that yeah", "89:39", "well also in this generation of people", "89:41",

"89:50", "about this there's this kind of", "89:51", "unfulfilled sense of future that we all", "89:54", "like anybody who grew up in the post-war", "89:56", "years in the 67th they were like you", "89:58", "know whatever his famous line we're", "89:59", "promised flying cars and all we got was", "90:01", "140 characters or whatever and I think", "90:03", "that applies to the space exploration", "90:05", "stuff is like well the government is no", "90:07", "longer doing the really ambitious shit", "90:09", "right but we can do it privately on the", "90:11", "other hand there is a government in

things", "90:48", "get done yeah yeah totally I mean that's", "90:52", "what I was saying before it's like it", "90:53", "gives you some hope for climate if like", "90:54", "Xi Jinping is just like okay immediately", "90:56", "no more coal mm-hmm they'll all stop you", "90:59", "know but he's also throwing two million", "91:00", "Muslims and concentration camps right", "91:03", "umm this Bezos thing I mean I'm not", "91:06", "criticizing you because I think it's a", "91:08", "very common thought but why is it that", "91:10", "we look at these super-rich billion", "91:11", "billionaire

"that's just how you're always gonna look", "91:22", "at someone who lives in a 100 million", "91:25", "dollar house and it's possible I think", "91:27", "when you look at I mean not to get to", "91:30", "like armchair psychology I think that", "91:31", "Bezos but when you look at the physical", "91:33", "transformation that he's put himself", "91:34", "through when you think about like the", "91:36", "life extension what has he done", "91:37", "physically he's just like I mean if you", "91:39", "if you look at photos of him when he's", "91:40", "like a young man he's you know just kind", "91:42", "of like dweeby right and now he's like", "91:44", "um an action hero", "91:46", "is he really yeah I mean maybe not like", "91:48", "you but he's like he's yeah he's pretty", "91:51", "this is Bezos jacked am I missing", "91:53", "something", "91:53", "let me show ya it looks different Google", "91:56", "pull up pull up some marriages of Jeff", "91:58", "Bezos jacked I didn't know but he got a", "92:03", "trainer I mean no I'm not blaming him", "92:06", "but that's only one part of it I would", "92:07", "say bigger than that is you know the the", "92:10", "high just how thin-skinned on the worlds", "92:12", "okay let me say zoom in oh I guess he's", "92:17", "got some arms yeah there is oh wow", "92:20", "that's a big difference", "92:22", "he's also got a vest on I guess his arms", "92:25", "do look pretty big yeah I mean I'm not", "92:29", "I'm in most ways I'm not a business", "92:30", "hater I think Amazon has been actually", "92:32", "really pretty great I'm a fan yeah I", "92:34", "like will listen to the guy talk and I", "92:36", "loved his letter to the National", "92:37", "Enquirer there he is right there yeah so", "92:40", "he looks fit yeah in front of the King", "92:42", "Kong rampage movie yeah that him yeah he", "92:45", "looks pretty good okay I guess physical", "92:50", "transformation but that's yeah probably", "92:51", "life extension like you're uploading", "92:53", "your brain to the computer it's somebody", "92:54", "busy into that ship he is actually I", "92:56", "think not as into it to some other", "92:58", "people but that is so sci-fi you know I", "93:01", "I interviewed Kurzweil a while back when", "93:04", "I was doing the sci-fi show and I went", "93:05", "to this 2045 conference that they had in", "93:08", "Manhattan and it was", "93:11", "these guys are they're talking about", "93:12", "something that they think will be", "93:14", "invented and they're acting as if it's", "93:16", "been invented inevitable yeah yeah", "93:18", "totally I mean Eric Schmidt has said", "93:19", "about climate change that the solution", "93:22", "is already here in the sense that AI", "93:24", "will just solve it like that what no", "93:27", "that's that's a weird thing that we do", "93:31", "though right we always looked like Oh", "93:33", "someone's gonna handle this", "93:35", "yeah well the brain upload stuff is", "93:37", "interesting to me with regard to climate", "93:39", "just because it's like a portal through", "93:42", "which we can escape environmental", "93:45", "degradation so if the world is on fire", "93:47", "and full of suffering maybe we can just", "93:50", "upload our minds to some machines and", "93:52", "not not live in the real world anymore", "93:54", "right and when I think about even my", "93:56", "relationship to my phone like tech", "93:58", "addiction generally we're sort of being", "94:00", "taught to think of the world on our", "94:02", "screens as more real than the world", "94:05", "that's around us and that sounds in a", "94:08", "lot of ways like decline a stand or", "94:09", "whatever but I also think it may be a", "94:11", "kind of coping mechanism for a world", "94:14", "that we're about to head into where", "94:15", "there is that much more suffering and", "94:17", "when I when I see for instance like the", "94:19", "whole wellness movement I think their", "94:21", "intuitions they are about like the", "94:22", "toxicity of the world and how we have to", "94:24", "avoid it I think the way that it'll", "94:26", "reshape our own sense of self and", "94:30", "relationship to the world and idea of", "94:33", "our place in nature and history all of", "94:35", "these things are really up in the air", "94:38", "and we'll be affected by climate change", "94:40", "I think in you know in ways that we", "94:42", "don't yet appreciate or understand so", "94:46", "the to wave the wand yeah what would be", "94:48", "step number one step number one is", "94:51", "ending fossil fuel subsidies and fossil", "94:53", "fuel subsidies number two step number", "94:57", "two just massive R&D investment a", "95:01", "massive investment in R&D and new",

aspects", "95:12", "of mitigating the problem yeah and yeah", "95:16", "new energy sources I mean that you know", "95:18", "you there really there are already new", "95:19", "business empires that were are from the", "95:22", "climate change era there are new solar", "95:24", "empires there", "95:24", "wind empires but that can happen", "95:27", "globally that needs to happen globally", "95:29", "and you know that's you know then we", "95:33", "have to we have to deal with agriculture", "95:35", "which maybe about seaweed and maybe", "95:37", "about lab-grown meat I don't know but", "95:38", "you know it's it's like the big picture", "95:42", "it's all carbon it's all just how much", "95:45", "carbon we put into the atmosphere so I", "95:48", "think it will come to be the case that", "95:49", "in the decades ahead", "95:51", "everything about the way that we", "95:52", "interact with the world will be", "95:56", "described and understood in terms of", "95:58", "carbon so that for instance you walk", "96:01", "down the aisle in the supermarket see", "96:03", "organic food you see non-gmo food you'll", "96:06", "also see like carbon free food and", "96:08", "that'll be a big part of the way that we", "96:09", "consume everything that things will be", "96:12", "advertised that way promote it that way", "96:14", "but globally we just need to really", "96:17", "focus on reducing carbon it's a like and", "96:20", "wherever it is which is almost", "96:22", "everywhere we need to figure out new", "96:23", "ways to do whatever it is we're doing", "96:26", "that's that's causing that problem we", "96:28", "need to make it trendy in LA I do have", "96:31", "some organic gluten-free carbon free", "96:32", "food I feel like that's already kind of", "96:34", "a should be yeah that would be as long", "96:36", "as that kicks in and people realize", "96:38", "there's some street cred to being carbon", "96:41", "free yeah I mean I think in different", "96:43", "parts of the world people will relate", "96:46", "differently to it so like yeah in China", "96:48", "they're scheduled to have this huge boom", "96:51", "in beef consumption and dairy", "96:53", "consumption because it's expected that", "96:56", "as that country gets richer the people", "96:59", "will adopt a more Western diet hmm but", "97:02", "it's also possible that they won't that", "97:06", "like the new Chinese middle class will", "97:08", "be still really interested in you know", "97:11", "tofu less interested in beef less", "97:15", "interested in milk they are they you", "97:16", "know and it might be it might be easier", "97:21", "to have them follow that path and it", "97:24", "will be to make the American average", "97:26", "American eat less beef but you know it's", "97:31", "it's everywhere it's like everywhere you", "97:33", "look there's some there's some problem", "97:35", "little problem to solve", "97:37", "but then when you pull back it really is", "97:39", "just carbon it's like absolutely", "97:40", "everything if you think about everything", "97:42", "you do in terms of the carbon impact it", "97:44", "has then you know the solutions to", "97:48", "suggest themselves and I do think that", "97:50", "in the coming decades if even if you and", "97:53", "I don't start to think in those terms", "97:54", "our policymakers well that like", "97:56", "everything will be we're entering into a", "97:58", "new trade agreement with Japan what's", "98:01", "the carbon budget here like what caused", "98:03", "their carbon behavior oh we're like you", "98:06", "know this we're providing some public", "98:09", "subsidies for this Factory", "98:10", "over here what's there like a mission", "98:12", "situation like can we ask them to bring", "98:16", "along some carbon capture plants so that", "98:18", "they reduce their footprint you know", "98:20", "every at every level the level of the", "98:23", "individual like talking about buying a", "98:25", "Tesla or buying a you know buying a", "98:27", "Range Rover or whatever I think we'll", "98:30", "start to think in in the term in terms", "98:32", "of carbon and that'll be a sign of just", "98:34", "how total climate change will have how", "98:37", "totally climate change will have", "98:38", "conquered the world so that there won't", "98:41", "be an aspect of modern life that will be", "98:43", "not just untouched but in a certain way", "98:45", "kind of uncovered by it yeah what about", "98:50", "is there a way to educate people in a", "98:55", "way that's not preachy that sort of", "98:56", "moves the needle in that direction I", "98:58", "think conversations like this are", "98:59", "important I think your books very", "99:01", "important and I think you know", "99:02", "interviews that I'm sure you're doing", "99:04", "right now on all these different shows", "99:05", "are important and everything kind of", "99:06", "like ups the needle or are just the",

the", "99:28", "song from Mary Poppins yeah I mean I", "99:30", "think in general like climate message", "99:32", "and climate communication has really", "99:34", "suffered for a long time because it was", "99:35", "so preachy and because it was so holier", "99:38", "than now and because the people that get", "99:40", "involved and it part of the reason why", "99:41", "they get involved in it's for virtue", "99:42", "signal totally and I've been asked like", "99:44", "you know as I've been permanent", "99:46", "promoting the book by a lot of people", "99:47", "like what have you done to in your life", "99:49", "to change", "99:50", "and it's like well I'm flying a little", "99:52", "bit less the flying really makes me feel", "99:53", "guilty but otherwise I basically haven't", "99:55",

think I think", "111:15", "the number of electricity is like 70% of", "111:18", "American electricity is wasted because", "111:20", "how bad the grid is like it just is so", "111:22", "bad at

"111:40", "electricity is wasted it's like we're", "111:42", "just throwing all that carbon to whatnot", "111:43", "you know that's giant yeah and if we", "111:47", "were less wasteful we'd have you know", "111:49", "less of a problem on our hands", "111:50", "but we still like order twice as much", "111:52", "food as we wanted then throw it out I", "111:53", "mean I knew that you know yeah um so you", "111:56", "can understand why someone would say to", "111:58", "you like what are you doing", "112:00", "but it's that sentiment behind it that's", "112:02", "kind of gross right yeah it's
