thought", "47:02", "that the free association with music", "47:05", "would create a more holistic fans", "47:10", "finding what they want and that we would", "47:12", "do well in that ecosystem that turned", "47:14", "out not to be the case and I think now", "47:18", "that it is sort of set up in the", "47:20", "streaming service world now that's", "47:22", "starting to be the case because people", "47:24", "are finding us because it's sort of", "47:25", "organized and there's sort of", "47:26", "institutional culture but and when it", "47:28", "was free wielding I don't think we", "47:30", "played the game well enough to take", "47:32", "advantage of it and and you know a lot", "47:33", "of trains just passed us by there was a", "47:35", "lot of argument that people would find", "47:37", "new music because of that in a way that", "47:39", "they would have never found if the", "47:41", "record companies and the radio stations", "47:43", "had a lock down on what got distributed", "47:45", "somebody did a study its my one piece of", "47:48", "empirical evidence like the British the", "47:51", "British Association of something when it", "47:54", "first became a

to prove that the", "48:19", "relationship was profitable in essence I", "48:22", "buy your your comedy concert I didn't", "48:26", "get it for free it makes me actually", "48:27", "assess whether or not", "48:29", "i my thing was a good investment and if", "48:32", "you prove to me it is I become more", "48:34", "loyal to you because now we're in a", "48:35", "relationship that makes sense yeah

you saw", "49:01", "Napster coming you looked at it and you", "49:03", "were like this this is something that is", "49:05", "inevitable we should probably figure out", "49:07", "a way to to yeah

"77:32", "more money it's like what does that mean", "77:34", "fast forward four years later and it's", "77:36", "like I'm making a lot more money mmm so", "77:39", "that sort of shows that it organically", "77:42", "so is discontent yes you know it's a", "77:44", "whether you call it jealousy or not and", "77:46", "then as I emerged as sort of the auteur", "77:48", "and the big mouth and the band and maybe", "77:50", "the person who was most willing to be", "77:52", "controversy or whatever we'd get in a", "77:54", "room with journalists and they would", "77:55", "just talk to me and then we get out of", "77:58", "the interviews and that the band members", "77:59", "would yell at me for them not being", "78:02", "asked questions this is like this weird", "78:05", "thing like it was my responsibility to", "78:07", "push them more as stars or yeah so it's", "78:11", "not just about the music it's about", "78:12", "being appreciated in successful analysis", "78:15", "in hindsight and in fairness to them I", "78:17", "didn't appreciate why it was important", "78:19", "to them because in their minds we're all", "78:22", "equal we're in the room together yeah", "78:24", "you write the songs that's cool but at", "78:26", "least give me the social currency right", "78:28", "Rob being recognized or yeah you know or", "78:32", "somebody would offer me alone a magazine",

"I'll take it you know what I mean right", "78:44", "you probably would have saw thought they", "78:46", "would do the same thing someone came", "78:48", "absolutely yeah absolutely and then of", "78:50", "course it becomes tit-for-tat then like", "78:52", "two of the band members went on their", "78:54", "own and made a record deal without me", "78:57", "they got somebody to give them a bunch", "78:59", "of money to start a label which they had", "79:01", "every right to do you know what I mean", "79:03", "so suddenly they're like making side", "79:04", "deals and you starts getting all that", "79:06", "weird business and right you know again", "79:08", "it's like an erosion factor you don't", "79:11", "appreciate it from within there's a lot", "79:12", "of compression there's a

been", "88:58", "established what happened right so", "89:01", "there's a lot of speculation I don't", "89:02", "know if you know the recent most recent", "89:04", "speculation that I talked about the", "89:05", "other day but in item the most recent", "89:07", "speculation is that John might have", "89:10", "snorted cocaine that was cut with", "89:11", "creatine that was contaminated with",

have", "89:47", "done some research online and found that", "89:49", "there have been cases of creatine that", "89:52", "was contaminated we buy cheap creatine", "89:54", "from China", "89:55",

entirely possible", "90:07", "that he did blow and that blow had", "90:10", "steroids in it through the contaminated", "90:12", "creatine gave it back to Cormier so", "90:15", "Cormier lost the question is did he lose", "90:19", "because John Jones is a cheater or did", "90:22", "he lose", "90:22", "because John Jones is an amazing fighter", "90:25", "so the the second one would be harder to", "90:28", "deal with because if he lost his John", "90:30", "Jones is an amazing fighter did coke ten", "90:33", "days out before their title fight and", "90:35", "kicked his ass and now they give Daniel", "90:39", "the title back it's very weird yeah", "90:42", "that's what I was asking more as a fan", "90:44", "like yeah the psychological person we", "90:46", "need a real fucking lie-detector test", "90:49", "that's what we need we do not green we", "90:51", "value honesty so much and there's very", "90:55", "little other than some rudimentary", "90:58", "observations they can make with

an", "91:32", "intense significance to it that's not", "91:35", "it's not a an option or it's not a sort", "91:39", "of factor in other sports is that you", "91:40", "can cause damage to your opponent like", "91:42", "physical damage that could affect them", "91:43", "for the rest of their life right right", "91:45", "like that was the case with Vitor", "91:46", "Belfort when he fought Michael

until he", "92:06", "decides to quit fighting and then I'll", "92:07", "have another surgery on it and the", "92:10", "question is like did Vitor land that", "92:12", "because he's highly skilled or did he", "92:14", "landed because high skilled and taking", "92:17", "testosterone it's your - you're you", "92:21", "increase your ability to cause damage", "92:23", "and that changes the game it's

this fractional idea of what", "92:52", "is just mm-hmm there's so many factors", "92:55", "of speed there's the amount of energy", "92:57", "that you have and then there's", "92:59", "psychological factors like confidence", "93:00", "there's no there's no metric to figure", "93:04", "out what what kind of an effect being a", "93:07", "juiced-up psychopath has like if you're", "93:10", "someone who like vitor belfort who's", "93:11", "already highly skilled and then you pump", "93:14", "him full of steroids and he comes out to", "93:16", "like motherfucker like he's just like it", "93:18", "feels like he can't lose and then he's", "93:19", "has so much confidence right and all the", "93:21", "skill on top of that this seat he's I", "93:25", "hate to pick on him but he's my favorite", "93:26", "example because the difference between", "93:28", "him on testosterone and him off", "93:31", "testosterone is so radical like there's", "93:33", "been these photos side to side of the",
