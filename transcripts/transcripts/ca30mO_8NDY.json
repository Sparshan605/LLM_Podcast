interpretation of it right and this", "104:44", "is what I had a really good professor", "104:47", "that took us on a tour in Rome of the", "104:49", "Vatican it was we got super lucky well", "104:52", "we hired a professor and he was", "104:54", "fantastic and he loved that I knew a lot", "104:58", "about ancient history particularly like", "105:00", "the use of drugs so like we were

"106:40", "like wild animals", "106:42", "yeah and I think when they thought of", "106:44", "like the barbarian hordes that would", "106:45", "come and in you know just fucking rape", "106:47", "and pillage they probably thought those", "106:49", "big fat juicy dicks or one of the", "106:52", "reasons whether it was so horrible and", "106:55", "so so base and vile and primitive and", "106:59", "that's big hogs and smashing skulls and", "107:02", "raping and killing they were trying to", "107:04", "move past that and one way that they", "107:07", "tried to express that was in their art",
