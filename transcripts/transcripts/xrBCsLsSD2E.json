that's true and I don't", "198:53", "think they know that for a fact and this", "198:55", "is one of the speculations that Graham", "198:57", "Hancock and Randall cross would have", "198:58",

around the great parent yeah", "200:10", "but there's there's plenty of evidence", "200:12", "that there was some sort of a massive", "200:15", "eventually around 10,000 and 12,000", "200:18", "years ago and what their belief is that", "200:20", "this is", "200:21", "all the stories of Atlantis come from", "200:22", "this is where all these stories of these", "200:24", "great civilizations that

coincided with", "200:35", "asteroid Olympics maybe but I mean we", "200:39", "know where the stories of Atlantis come", "200:40", "from Plato right but he gone to Egypt", "200:45", "and and been

temple that the", "201:23", "Sphinx was carved out of were they the", "201:25", "Sphinx is the walls of the temple and he", "201:28", "believes it's from water erosion there's", "201:30", "this these

hundreds of geologists that have", "201:57", "signed off on this this is not like and", "201:59", "there's he goes over the physical", "202:02", "evidence of these fissures and how", "202:03", "they're made he's like as a geologist I", "202:06", "can tell you you are looking at", "202:07", "thousands of years of rainfall the last", "202:09", "time there was serious rainfall in the", "202:11", "Nile Valley was about 7,000 BC", "202:13", "so what he's saying is it's entirely", "202:16", "possible that there have been many", "202:18", "different civilizations that lived in",

a", "202:36", "place that did exist ten thousand years", "202:39", "ago twelve thousand years ago because I", "202:42", "like is but don't say no it didn't", "202:43", "because you don't really know

problem right when you get", "209:10", "this 12,000 years ago who knows what the", "209:12", "fuck that's the end of the Ice Age isn't", "209:14", "it and we think they", "209:15", "new things and then we find out that", "209:17", "they knew more you know", "209:18", "when Martha is mostly covered in ice how", "209:21", "could you get an advance it was heart of", "209:23", "the earth yes mostly

Stonehenge was built", "210:24", "over a period of like like thousand", "210:26", "years I mean it took a long time to just", "210:29", "put these fucking stones right you know", "210:30", "so I mean we don't know how long this", "210:33", "would have taken but to have a bunch of", "210:34", "carved stones upright even if they're", "210:36", "big that just requires more people that", "210:38",

because", "211:01", "it wasn't that is an advanced", "211:06", "civilization then well no well yeah I", "211:08", "mean it's advanced for the rest of the", "211:10", "world but it's it's pretty advanced for", "211:12", "today if we wanted to build something", "211:13", "like today would take massive resources", "211:16", "it would take huge machines it would", "211:18", "take a gigantic group of engineers", "211:20", "that's a huge project I mean you mean", "211:23", "out of convenience right that's messing", "211:25", "that even though is it out of", "211:26", "convenience when you get 19 foot tall", "211:29", "stones that are because you don't really", "211:31", "get loads in a people zoom in a circle I", "211:33", "mean it's a lot of work", "211:34", "of course this yeah that's why we'd use", "211:36", "machines it's not as simple as you just", "211:40", "use machines like you'd have to get very", "211:42", "specific massive machines that are", "211:44", "incredibly difficult and trays and these", "211:46", "people did that without any of that shit", "211:47", "yeah they do pretty logs the prominent", "211:51", "pulleys actually believe ropes and logs", "211:52", "who knows how the fuck they did it", "211:54", "that's what we're supposed to be there", "211:55", "was no wheel back then no probably", "211:57", "wasn't that's pretty spectacular yeah", "212:01", "yeah okay yeah okay so let me so I'm not", "212:05", "trying to take away the amount of effort", "212:07", "involved in building this thing and the", "212:10", "willpower to do it and the manpower to", "212:12", "do it what are you trying to say there's", "212:14", "not an indicative of advanced", "212:16", "civilization what when I think I think", "212:18", "it's a definition of advanced for", "212:20", "example like I would consider an", "212:21", "advanced take a civilization path", "212:23", "writing I would consider them to have", "212:24", "metallurgy I would consider and the I", "212:26", "wouldn't even call this advanced this", "212:27", "mean this is this is this puts them this", "212:30", "puts them where we were 4000 years ago", "212:33", "you know as a species so advanced is", "212:35", "like assuming it's all it's all well", "212:38", "yeah well I mean it's all relative isn't", "212:39", "it so it's like I mean what I mean yeah", "212:42", "I mean if you want if if you want to", "212:44", "speculate them up in a civilization like", "212:45", "pre Ice Age or during the Ice Age that", "212:48", "had writing and metallurgy and you know", "212:52", "great cities and international trade", "212:55", "agriculture that's all the sort of stuff", "212:57", "that we would if you look at the Roman", "212:58", "Empire we see if we take them as the", "213:00", "model of an advanced civilization right", "213:02", "but when I say advanced we mean not as", "213:05", "advanced as we are now very modern right", "213:07", "right well that's what everyone", "213:08", "speculates about Atlantis as well no one", "213:10", "ever thinks that it was like today they", "213:12", "think some crazy things some people", "213:14", "really oh yes some people some people", "213:16", "are yeah but yeah this is we should have", "213:20", "been more specific but yeah I mean I'm", "213:23", "sure that for the time like when a", "213:25", "runner Brandon tribe came over the hill", "213:27", "and they saw a Buckley tepee and it was", "213:29", "incredible ah the gods have built this", "213:31", "you know that's what they would thought", "213:33", "I'm sure you know to them it would have", "213:35", "relatively been incredible", "213:36", "you know I'm doing wrong and I don't", "213:38", "take away the achievement for the people", "213:40", "who made it because it's unbelievably", "213:41", "good", "213:42", "you know especially for the time but", "213:44", "like if if they didn't have like Mel", "213:45", "tools didn't have writing they didn't", "213:47", "have agriculture I wouldn't call that", "213:49", "advanced I just call that a loss of work", "213:50", "for a primitive civilization and the", "213:52", "same way this Stonehenge would have been", "213:53", "the real problem is we don't really know", "213:55", "what they had and until more evidence", "213:58", "gets uncovered they're just guessing", "214:00", "they have some carbon dating they know", "214:02", "that the stones exist they don't even", "214:04", "know I mean they didn't even know about", "214:05", "this until 1990 something I mean they", "214:08", "found it in the 90s yeah but I mean that", "214:10", "all over Northern Europe there's stone", "214:12", "circles henges me yeah well they find", "214:15", "more of those now than ever before with", "214:16", "satellites right yeah they're finding", "214:19", "now in the Amazon you know like what the", "214:21", "fuck is this they're finding all these", "214:22", "structures and channels and yeah well", "214:26", "that's the loss you know about that", "214:28", "right there's a there was a guy who went", "214:31", "looking was an explorer went looking for", "214:33", "the lost city of Z in the Amazon it was", "214:36", "like a mythical lost city and he got", "214:39", "eaten by cannibals apparently there's", "214:40", "some movie that's coming out about him", "214:42", "right now that's racist no privilege it", "214:49", "was um it was speculated that before the", "214:52", "M well that's the other thing that came", "214:54", "out recently the Amazon was covered in", "214:55", "an ocean somewhere around ten million", "214:57", "years ago or someplace oh yeah but they", "214:59", "think that these people had some sort of", "215:02", "you know for the time again what is an", "215:04", "advanced civilization yeah they probably", "215:06", "needs to be defined yeah I think that's", "215:07", "the first stuff but yeah I mean like", "215:09", "this interesting sale of it isn't the", "215:11", "path London advancing no no really you", "215:12", "know it was a beautiful thing", "215:14", "it has a great construct and it cost the", "215:16", "Athenians a lot of money and they did it", "215:17", "to beautify the city and make it the", "215:19", "jewel of Greece but it wasn't like", "215:23", "what's more impressive is it's more they", "215:25", "did for political reasons the Parthenon", "215:28", "is built the speed ramblas they did it", "215:30", "the Acropolis is what's a really a trip", "215:32", "what it's cuz giant fucking chunks of", "215:35", "stone they have no it you know how big", "215:37", "they are yeah open they're huge", "215:39", "like what they don't even know why", "215:41", "they're there there weren't even built", "215:43", "at the same time the Acropolis is just a", "215:45", "natural stone formation not necessarily", "215:47", "there's stones under that natural stone", "215:49", "that like the the the actual platform", "215:51", "that the Parthenon was built on existed", "215:54", "before the Parthenon", "215:55", "right I'm not sure it follow what you", "215:58", "saying it because as far as I'm aware", "215:59", "they quickly the crapple it's just a", "216:01", "large stone formation then they I guess", "216:02", "they must have level it office on", "216:03", "something but then there's actual", "216:05", "physical stones actual monstrous", "216:07", "physical stones that are involved and", "216:10", "Moltar and cesium so up Jeff oh let's", "216:13", "see if you could find that there's a", "216:14", "bunch of the other all like what's the", "216:16", "thing in Malta where they thought it was", "216:17", "like build by cyclopses or something", "216:19", "giant so he's like three thousand years", "216:20", "be cities that Baalbek no that's in", "216:23", "Lebanon there's Baalbek in Lebanon they", "216:25", "found these enormous stone carved things", "216:28", "yeah but yeah see those stones which", "216:30", "one's the there's there's some stones if", "216:34", "you could find some images of the yeah", "216:36", "some of it does from that side I'm", "216:38", "pretty sure that's just a natural stone", "216:39", "up I mean I mean this sort of like", "216:41", "fortifications around it you know you", "216:42", "can probably do ghulam find out mmm put", "216:44", "up is put on a sixteenth century or", "216:46", "something you know there's nothing", "216:48", "mystical about the Parthenon it's just a", "216:50", "really useful defensive fortification", "216:51", "will not missed a call to saying ancient", "216:53", "I think they are the speculation is that", "216:56", "the the crop which one's the Acropolis", "216:59", "not as bottoms the Parthenon to the top", "217:01", "know the powerful know is only Acropolis", "217:03", "the Parthenon is on the top and the", "217:05", "Acropolis is on the bottom that's what", "217:06", "I'm saying that they the thing that they", "217:09", "think okay", "217:12", "all together yeah and the part that I", "217:14", "was just a building yeah right okay the", "217:16", "Putnam was a temple and so when you say", "217:18", "the Acropolis the Parthenon is Kontest", "217:20", "cities had an Acropolis which is just a", "217:22", "raised rocky bit that they built you", "217:25", "know", "217:26", "so find out where when I read that see", "217:29", "if he could Google", "217:30", "man-made stones in the Acropolis there", "217:34", "was some sort of weird speculation that", "217:36", "the Acropolis was a part of some", "217:38",
