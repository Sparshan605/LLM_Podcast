["00:00", "hello freak bitches so if you start if", "00:03", "you take a guitar string and you split", "00:07", "it into four equal parts you put your", "00:08", "finger over one quarter of the string", "00:12", "and then you start just plucking the", "00:15", "string and hovering above the string so", "00:17", "you don't actually push it to the", "00:18", "fretboard those notes occur naturally as", "00:22", "the harmonics in the expansion of the", "00:25", "vibrating string so that those notes", "00:27", "were not really chosen by Roy Orbison or", "00:30", "whoever wrote the song they were really", "00:31", "chosen by like a Fourier series and it", "00:34", "feels like it's a riff but I discovered", "00:37", "this when I was in Indonesia as I would", "00:39", "start playing that and people would", "00:41", "react I thought like why that song what", "00:43", "about more complex creative and sort of", "00:47", "improvisational song like voodoo child", "00:48", "from Hendrix so I don't know about", "00:51", "voodoo child I mean well you take taking", "01:00", "out and it changes up so I if you look", "01:03", "at the first couple of chords of red", "01:05", "house there's like some seventh or", "01:08", "diminished chord mm-hmm and like he's", "01:10", "arpeggiating Nana and then he moves it", "01:12", "down a half step which has to do with", "01:15", "this tritone substitution and the", "01:17", "symmetry inside of the seventh chord so", "01:21", "if I recall correctly you have a chord", "01:24", "like ceg b-flat would be a c7 chord and", "01:29", "the E and they b-flat would form this", "01:32", "thing called a tritone and now if you", "01:35", "went in the blues either three elements", "01:38", "of the chord progression the dominant", "01:40", "sub-dominant and the tonic if you go", "01:43", "down a half step you effectively invert", "01:47", "the third in the flat seventh so if you", "01:51", "go one half-step below that it's the", "01:53", "flat seventh and the third I think of", "01:55", "the subdominant chord so Hendrix is", "01:56", "actually playing with math mm-hmm in", "01:59", "something as basic as do you think he's", "02:03", "aware of it or do you think he's doing", "02:04", "it sort of just instinctual well first", "02:07", "of all when you're visited by an alien", "02:09", "intelligence we went through cuttlefish", "02:10", "and we now Jimmy", "02:12", "so it you know that's like these are the", "02:14", "these are the best alien sightings we", "02:16", "have right it's very hard to speculate", "02:19", "but I I just looked at everything I've", "02:22", "been able to understand about what he", "02:24", "did and you you know you're dealing with", "02:26", "a super mind as well as an intuitive", "02:29", "right mastery master of the instrument", "02:32", "complete understanding of the chords and", "02:34", "progressions and just the ability to", "02:36", "improvise and to make it sound different", "02:39", "adding the wah wah pedal and all that", "02:41", "distortion and all the shit that used to", "02:43", "Dan the fact that he imparts more into", "02:45", "one note like I wouldn't even know how", "02:47", "to notate I mean what is even the", "02:49", "instrument you didn't play the guitar he", "02:51", "played the guitar amplification you know", "02:55", "signal processing system as a whole", "02:57", "yeah so you know there are these people", "03:00", "who are just in some multi dimensional", "03:03", "space another one of my favorites is a", "03:05", "guy named Roy Buchanan who somehow these", "03:09", "guys who understand harmonics gravitate", "03:12", "to Telecasters and you know pull up song", "03:16", "called Roy's blues and watch him just go", "03:19", "into the multiverse and start playing", "03:22", "with things that you can't even imagine", "03:24", "are possible so I do think that that", "03:27", "there's a very close relationship", "03:30", "between algorithms and emotion and I", "03:33", "wait but wait with Harvey he was the guy", "03:37", "that would give girls the shoulder rubs", "03:39", "he would tell them to massage him oh
