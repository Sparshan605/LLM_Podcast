came", "74:02", "out last year in last winter and talked", "74:06", "about how they feel cyber terrorism", "74:09", "is one of the biggest threats to the", "74:11", "country and in in that speech

pretty", "74:22", "much meant he was referring to anonymous", "74:24", "so so journalistically that became if", "74:26", "you cover anonymous you have a chance of", "74:28", "getting subpoenaed because the federal", "74:29", "government is against anons and so it", "74:31", "became very difficult to cover that", "74:33", "story as well and and became more of an", "74:37", "analysis on whether we were able to", "74:39", "spend the legal money then whether the", "74:41", "story is journalistically important I", "74:43", "think the anonymous story is is very", "74:45", "important because we can't allow the", "74:47", "federal government to come out and just", "74:48", "call people terrorist or cyber", "74:51", "terrorists cyber terrorists or try to", "74:53", "instill fear we

rights", "75:25", "in order to ensure the safety of the", "75:27", "United States", "75:28", "I mean what what the fuck or they or", "75:30", "they just look we're corrupt", "75:31", "we're just corrupt is how we do it we're", "75:34", "just assholes nation you know or or it", "75:38", "really lets you know whose agenda", "75:40", "they're there on like if you look at the", "75:42", "situation with the FBI going after", "75:44", "anonymous and spending those kind of", "75:46", "resources on on anonymous wait a minute", "75:48", "why aren't you going after the bankers", "75:49",

it's", "76:19", "so important for us as journalists to be", "76:21", "able to get in", "76:22", "and and talk to these individuals I", "76:24", "wonder how they justify it at the", "76:27", "highest level I really would would love", "76:29", "to see the meetings when when they get", "76:32", "together and draft something like the", "76:33", "National Defense Authorization Act I", "76:35", "would love to see what the the", "76:36", "conversation is like when you like what", "76:39", "do you wanna put in there we fucking", "76:41", "lock them up like for whatever for", "76:43", "whatever for anything for you want to", "76:44", "just put for being an enemy of the state", "76:46", "yeah let me say that's good it's good", "76:48", "any other state which is such a vague", "76:50", "you know

wraps", "77:31", "so because it wasn't with the New York", "77:33", "Times then all of a sudden this guy can", "77:34", "be labeled an enemy of the state I mean", "77:36", "could you imagine it would be a very", "77:38", "different reaction if the New York Times", "77:39", "printed that and the government went", "77:41", "after the New York Times and called it", "77:43", "New York Times enemy of
