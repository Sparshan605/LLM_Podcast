["00:02", "three-two-one yes", "00:06", "hello Boyan hi there welcome thank you", "00:08", "thanks for doing this I really", "00:09", "appreciate it and I love what you're", "00:11", "doing", "00:11", "I've seen your TED talk I've seen many", "00:13", "in numerous conferences that you've", "00:15", "appeared at and discussions you've given", "00:18", "on this and for people to jump into this", "00:21", "right now what you've done is think long", "00:25", "and hard and devise a method to", "00:27", "try to clean up some of the plastic that", "00:29", "we have floating around in the ocean", "00:31", "famously the Pacific Garbage Patch is", "00:34", "this enormous patch of garbage that's", "00:36", "between California and Hawaii how did", "00:39", "you get involved in this and what what", "00:42", "you're a young guy hole do you 23", "00:44", "already 23 already", "00:46", "you sound like oh my god oh yeah how old", "00:49", "were you started this um I think I", "00:51", "started thinking about this when I was", "00:52", "16 and founded this organization when is", "00:55", "18 that's crazy", "00:57", "all you lazy fucks out there they're 16", "01:00", "years old that aren't doing shit with", "01:01", "your life just think about this kid", "01:03", "that's amazing", "01:04", "I'm so happy there's people like you in", "01:06", "the world no thank you yeah", "01:08", "so you started thinking about it when", "01:09", "you were 16 and you know this is", "01:11", "something that is extremely disturbing", "01:14", "to anybody that's paid attention", "01:15", "especially when you see the birds that", "01:17", "have died with all these plastic bottle", "01:19", "caps inside their bodies and you know", "01:21", "you see their carcasses with these", "01:22", "multicolored caps in them and they", "01:24", "thought these things were food it was", "01:26", "just one of the many many many problems", "01:30", "that occur when you have plastic", "01:33", "floating around in just enormous numbers", "01:36", "in the ocean sure yeah I mean there's", "01:39", "really three problems with this plastic", "01:40", "first of all obviously the ecosystem", "01:42", "damage I think they're right about 800", "01:45", "species that actually could go extinct", "01:46", "because of this plastic pollution then", "01:49", "there's the economic threat in terms of", "01:52", "you know damage to fisheries damage to", "01:55", "tourism and things like that I think", "01:57", "it's around thirteen billion dollars a", "01:59", "year according to the UN and then", "02:02", "thirdly there's the health impact or the", "02:03", "potential health impact because these", "02:05", "tiny plastic pieces they're actually", "02:07", "also end up in in the fish we eat that", "02:10", "take chemicals with it", "02:12", "yeah that ends up on our dinner plate as", "02:15", "well so what was it that prompted you to", "02:18", "dedicate essentially dedicate your young", "02:20", "life to this I sure yeah so I've always", "02:23", "been very passionate about technology", "02:26", "and just building things I think sort of", "02:29", "having an idea in your mind and then", "02:31", "seeing that become reality able to touch", "02:33", "it and things like that I think there's", "02:35", "literally no better feeling in the world", "02:37", "than that so if I've been building my", "02:39", "own things since it was two years old I", "02:41", "think first starting with things like", "02:43", "treehouses and zip lines but then going", "02:46", "into sort of computers and explosives", "02:48", "and rockets and things like that which", "02:50", "was a lot of fun but it wasn't very", "02:52", "useful I would say so it's kind of", "02:55", "looking for something sort of a", "02:57", "something that real to to to work on a", "02:59", "real problem and that's what I'd been", "03:02", "came across when I was 16 years old it", "03:04", "was scuba diving in Greece and I came", "03:06", "across small plastic bags of fish and I", "03:08", "wondered why can't we just clean this up", "03:10", "and that question sort of kept circling", "03:13", "around in my head and yeah I sort of", "03:16", "thought about how could we do this the", "03:18", "ocean is pretty big", "03:19", "I then eventually came up with this idea", "03:21", "to use these net Rosen currents to let", "03:25", "us collect the plastic and so how do you", "03:27", "have many different prototypes that you", "03:32", "started with and you eventually wound up", "03:33", "with what you have now and have you", "03:35", "started implementing him yet oh yeah I", "03:36", "mean so the the the concept that was", "03:39", "presented back in 2012 with my my first", "03:43", "TEDx talk and if you compare that to", "03:46", "where we are right now it's sort of day", "03:48", "and night of a difference so yeah", "03:51", "through testing and through all these", "03:54", "prototyping --zz yeah obviously there", "03:56", "has been a lot of development there but", "03:58", "the the key idea has stayed the same", "04:00", "that instead of going after the plastic", "04:03", "with boats and nets which would take", "04:05", "around about seventy nine thousand years", "04:07", "to to clean up just this Great Pacific", "04:08", "Garbage Patch instead of doing that we", "04:11", "let the plastic come to us so use", "04:12", "basically a network a fleet of very long", "04:15", "floating barriers which are oriented in", "04:18", "a u-shape and they float around and they", "04:20", "kind of act like a massive pac-man so", "04:23", "yes like like a funnel brings the", "04:26", "towards it the network ocean currents", "04:28", "push it against it moves towards the", "04:30", "center becomes very concentrated and", "04:32", "once it's concentrated well then it's", "04:34", "easy to get it out and ship it to land", "04:36", "for recycling and has this started yet", "04:38", "over the past so we were founded yeah", "04:42", "right four years ago in that time once", "04:45", "that we did the reconnaissance so we map", "04:48", "the patch with 30 boats and an airplane", "04:50", "at the same time to really understand", "04:52", "how much is out there which turns out to", "04:53", "be 1.8 trillion pieces floating in this", "04:56", "Great Pacific Garbage Patch and on the", "04:58", "other hand we've done all the testing so", "05:01", "we've done hundreds of scale model tests", "05:03", "we've done prototypes back in Europe on", "05:06", "the North Sea and actually right now", "05:08", "we're manufacturing the the first real", "05:10", "clean up system which is scheduled to be", "05:13", "launched from San Francisco to the Great", "05:16", "Pacific Garbage Patch in around two or", "05:18", "three months time so it has anything", "05:20", "been used like is there a proof of", "05:22", "concept of have you've done like real", "05:25", "large-scale testing where you've shown", "05:27", "that you can actually do this well I", "05:29", "mean we've done a lot of subsystem", "05:31", "testing so the the the prototypes in the", "05:33", "North Sea for example where there are", "05:34", "these 12 meter sections and we we", "05:37", "managed though to to keep that in one", "05:39", "piece so but then and also the plastic", "05:42", "capturing that worked very well on the", "05:43", "lab but yeah the real the real proof of", "05:48", "course has to come from this one real", "05:50", "system in the Great Pacific Garbage", "05:52", "Patch collecting plastic and that's what", "05:54", "we really hope to achieve this year so", "05:56", "this is the big one right the Great", "05:57", "Pacific Garbage Patch is the largest yes", "05:59", "it was carrot weaned California and", "06:02", "Hawaii yeah so there are five areas in", "06:04", "the world where plastic concentrates", "06:06", "this is by far the largest one there are", "06:09", "four others but they are they combined", "06:12", "ly contain less plastic than this one in", "06:16", "the in the Northeast and why do we know", "06:17", "what it is probably because of Asia", "06:20", "so Asia has quite a big problem in terms", "06:23", "of that they they use a lot of plastic", "06:25", "but they don't have a good", "06:26", "infrastructure so by far the largest", "06:28", "source of plastic flowing into the ocean", "06:31", "is also this there's one continent and", "06:33", "what's being released their naturally", "06:35", "bite because of the currents ends up in", "06:37", "this North Pacific patch it's such a", "06:39", "strange", "06:39", "problem because it wasn't something that", "06:42", "was discussed in the 80s or the 90s it", "06:45", "was nothing and then all the sudden", "06:46", "somewhere in the year 2000 I remember", "06:48", "hearing about the massive amount of", "06:50", "plastic we have in the ocean and it just", "06:52", "it just made sense I was like oh well of", "06:54", "course of course it's gonna wind up", "06:55", "there but the sheer size of it is", "06:58", "staggering yeah and I think that to me", "07:00", "the worrying thing is that it's a it's a", "07:02", "persistent problem so yeah with many", "07:04", "other kinds of pollutions when you sort", "07:06", "of turn up the tap its will be solved by", "07:08", "itself think about for example the the", "07:10", "ozone hole with the CFCs but with this", "07:14", "like if you turn off the tap the problem", "07:16", "is still there and in a hundred years it", "07:17", "will still be there so so I think to", "07:20", "truly solve it you need to do two things", "07:22", "on one side we have to close the tap on", "07:24", "the other hand we also need to clean it", "07:25", "out Jamie just pulled up a size", "07:28", "comparison where it shows 1.6 million", "07:32", "square kilometres an area twice the size", "07:36", "of Texas or three times the size of", "07:37", "France yeah so this is a study we", "07:39", "published a few a few weeks ago so this", "07:42", "was the result of the reconnaissance", "07:44", "effort it's kind of funny like every", "07:47", "other news outlet used a different size", "07:50", "comparison so I think with CNN that says", "07:52", "it was the size of Mongolia we always", "07:56", "use vs. yeah Texas for America yeah we", "07:58", "use Texas for everything more times", "08:00", "California yeah so yeah it's pretty", "08:03", "pretty big area it's insane and and it's", "08:05", "getting bigger I'm sure yeah so the I", "08:08", "mean the area doesn't really change is", "08:09", "more the the concentration concentration", "08:11", "when did we realize that this was an", "08:14", "issue like collectively scientists", "08:16", "geologists yeah so there hasn't been", "08:18", "there have been sort of small sampling", "08:21", "efforts since the 70s back then it was", "08:24", "the first time plastic was described as", "08:26", "being something that floats in the ocean", "08:27", "but it really only entered the the", "08:29", "public consciousness I think in the late", "08:31", "90s there was this this captain charles", "08:34", "moore who were sort of sailing through", "08:38", "it and he saw this plastic and he was", "08:39", "like we need to describe this and then", "08:42", "he did a scientific paper on it and yeah", "08:46", "and actually i think he was the one that", "08:47", "termed that the term Great Pacific", "08:49", "Garbage Patch so he was riding his boat", "08:52", "through it for", "08:53", "long period of time I guess yeah I think", "08:55", "it was it was participating in some", "08:57", "sailing race and he went through it and", "09:00", "then yeah he just saw that's so he was", "09:03", "the sort of the canary in the coal mine", "09:04", "I guess yeah yeah so what what is it one", "09:09", "of those things where it's hard to get", "09:12", "different governments to act on this", "09:14", "because you know it who is responsible", "09:16", "for the ocean yeah I think it's a sort", "09:19", "of this tragic tragedy of the Commons", "09:21", "right where it's international waters", "09:23", "sort of everyone's problem but at the", "09:24", "same time legally it's no one's problem", "09:26", "so yeah and beside to that what I really", "09:32", "felt when I started the ocean cleanup", "09:33", "was that I think everyone wanted this", "09:36", "problem to be solved but at the same", "09:38", "time we didn't really have a way to do", "09:40", "it there was simply wasn't any", "09:41", "technology to do that and that's why I", "09:43", "thought well perhaps this is an", "09:45", "opportunity to combine my interests of a", "09:48", "solving this program would be also", "09:50", "developing technology which is that what", "09:52", "we did is there anyone else doing this", "09:54", "so there are many organizations working", "09:56", "on the on the prevention side right so", "09:59", "educating people think about policies", "10:02", "those kind of things which is very", "10:04", "important I think but unfortunately", "10:07", "we're the only ones that sort of do the", "10:09", "the hard technology side of it and yeah", "10:12", "I wish you know more people will do it", "10:14", "if somebody else would clean the ocean", "10:17", "that'd be fine with us as well but until", "10:21", "somebody else does it yeah we're kind of", "10:23", "the ones that have to do that's so", "10:25", "fascinating to me that are the seven", "10:27", "billion people on the planet sometimes", "10:28", "it really does just take one person to", "10:32", "act one person do something about", "10:34", "something that I mean I'm aware of many", "10:37", "people aware of many people listening", "10:38", "you've heard about this and and it's", "10:40", "sort of one of those things that's in", "10:41", "the back of your mind that doesn't", "10:42", "affect you in a daily basis so you say", "10:44", "well that's a tragedy that's a terrible", "10:46", "thing but it's not my problem I have my", "10:49", "own problems but you this one person", "10:52", "decided to do something about it the", "10:53", "fact that you did when you were 16 is so", "10:57", "fascinating to me and someone has to do", "10:59", "it right but isn't that weird", "11:01", "someone has to but nobody was doing shit", "11:03", "until you came", "11:06", "that's very interesting yeah yeah", "11:09", "it's sometimes wonder yeah sometimes", "11:12", "people ask me like why why do you do it", "11:15", "and like dance my answer would be like", "11:18", "why not yeah why isn't everyone doing", "11:20", "this my one thing that I was thinking", "11:23", "was and this is my same feeling about", "11:26", "pollution air pollution is that once", "11:29", "they figured out a way to use whatever", "11:31", "is in the particulates in air pollution", "11:33", "as a resource sure and make it valuable", "11:35", "then people are going to be running to", "11:37", "extract it out of the skies and I felt", "11:39", "the same way about the Pacific Garbage", "11:41", "Patch and all the other ocean currents", "11:43", "where they have this this issue so is it", "11:46", "the currents bring everything together", "11:48", "collectively into one area just because", "11:51", "of the way the ocean moves exactly so", "11:53", "you have these sort of current at the", "11:56", "equator and then you have these boundary", "11:58", "currents and it's sort of X like the", "12:00", "yeah like the the sinking your bathtub", "12:03", "right so it's sort of where all the", "12:05", "plastic once again now is it possible to", "12:09", "take that stuff all of that Pacific all", "12:11", "those disgusting particles and use it", "12:14", "for something yeah I mean sure actually", "12:17", "a few examples with me in my bag but", "12:20", "it's not here right now go grab it you", "12:22", "wanna grab it no I do it a bit I can", "12:26", "describe it okay it's a podcast anyway", "12:28", "so so what we do is we take the plastic", "12:31", "out and we recycle that we've developed", "12:34", "a process for this and we can turn it", "12:37", "into new products actually the the pair", "12:39", "of sunglasses that finally be able to", "12:40", "wear after a dreaded northern European", "12:43", "winter they we already made that out of", "12:46", "plastic that we took out of the Great", "12:48", "Pacific Garbage Patch so you're wearing", "12:50", "sunglasses that are recycled from the", "12:52", "ocean exactly and and the ideas that we", "12:54", "can do anything with this right so you", "12:55", "can imagine sort of the part of your", "12:58", "next car or in your chair or whatever", "13:01", "you can make that out of ocean plastic", "13:03", "and what we think is that the material", "13:05", "itself isn't valuable enough but it's", "13:07", "really the the story behind it so the", "13:09", "fact that you can say well it's made out", "13:11", "of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch which", "13:13", "we think will add value so it's like the", "13:15", "difference between a normal pebble and", "13:17", "and the piece of a", "13:19", "the Berlin Wall it's right one is worth", "13:22", "shit and the other is worth something", "13:24", "all right so that's what we kind of want", "13:26", "to use as a way to to then be able to", "13:28", "fund the the operations of the cleaner I", "13:30", "think that's a fantastic idea and I", "13:32", "think that'll be a huge value for people", "13:34", "I mean I think people will really want", "13:36", "to buy something that they know has", "13:38", "recycled out of something that was", "13:40", "choking fish and birds to death yeah and", "13:42", "not only that but he does is turning", "13:45", "plastic from the ocean into $200 shoes", "13:47", "sportswear maker is teaming up with", "13:49", "something sell three new shoes made with", "13:52", "plastic pulled from the ocean wow that's", "13:54", "awesome the kind of stuff you can do so", "13:56", "I mean this also adidas actually didn't", "13:59", "use plastic from the ocean they I think", "14:01", "they just said that for from marketing", "14:03", "reasons they then make that from plastic", "14:05", "that was sort of they call it ocean", "14:07", "bound so oh those lie motherfuckers god", "14:11", "damn it they got him yeah that's", "14:14", "bullshit so it's on the way to the ocean", "14:16", "yeah which I guess any could be anything", "14:19", "fuck it was like we were gonna throw it", "14:21", "out we decided to make sneakers right", "14:23", "that's horrible I mean still they're", "14:32", "very cool I like I like them and I like", "14:34", "the the people that work on it that's", "14:36", "everything but that's a lie yeah well", "14:39", "yeah a white like a little bit yeah but", "14:43", "yeah so I mean the composition of the", "14:46", "plastic that we'll be pulling out of the", "14:47", "ocean is it's pretty unique it's it's", "14:49", "quite degraded because of the decades of", "14:52", "UV light hitting it so so we really had", "14:55", "to develop a new process to do this so", "14:57", "probably maybe in a year or so we'll be", "14:59", "actually be able to launch the first", "15:01", "line of products made out of sort of", "15:03", "real the real deal the plastic actually", "15:05", "coming out of the ocean", "15:06", "that's excellent so you're gonna sell", "15:08", "like raw plastic and is there an issue", "15:10", "of who owns the plastic I mean even cuz", "15:13", "it cuz is in the Commons of the the", "15:16", "ocean in international waters I think", "15:18", "it'd be hilarious if somebody would sort", "15:20", "of raise their hand is there others my", "15:21", "plastic I put it in there I think that", "15:24", "we have another kind of legal issue yeah", "15:25", "but if it comes a resource like oil yeah", "15:29", "yeah I think there's some there's like", "15:31", "this these Salvage laws", "15:33", "if you sort of salvage something brought", "15:36", "the international ocean you can actually", "15:37", "keep it so that doesn't appear to be an", "15:41", "issue but yeah definitely it will be", "15:44", "yeah sort of closing the circle will be", "15:46", "a fun project yeah I mean it sounds it", "15:50", "sounds like an amazing thing and I", "15:52", "guarantee people would be very very", "15:53", "interested to buy things that they know", "15:56", "were made out of something that was", "15:58", "really a horrible side effect of", "16:02", "civilization yeah I think if you have", "16:05", "the choice between a normal Molly's", "16:07", "let's use this sunglass example you know", "16:09", "a normal pair or a pair coming out of", "16:11", "the ocean I think 9 out of 10 people", "16:13", "would choose that", "16:14", "oh for sure I mean I think it would be", "16:16", "giant for companies to to advertise that", "16:18", "we only use a hundred percent recycled", "16:20", "from the ocean plastic I mean yeah that", "16:23", "would be gigantic how long do you think", "16:25", "it would be before this could be a", "16:26", "reality", "16:29", "so the first system is currently being", "16:31", "assembled so we are renting a former", "16:34", "naval base in at the San Francisco Bay", "16:36", "where it's currently being put together", "16:38", "it's a it's still relatively small", "16:40", "system it's 2,000 feet in length so", "16:43", "eventually they'll be almost double this", "16:44", "size but this is that this one will be", "16:48", "launched in late June early July then", "16:52", "we'll take it out the first the first", "16:54", "deployment will not yet be directly in", "16:56", "the patch so we're just deploying it", "16:58", "around 300 miles of the coast just to", "17:00", "make sure that it works well sort of a", "17:02", "final rehearsal if that goes well then", "17:05", "by probably around August we should be", "17:07", "ready to take it all the way to the", "17:08", "patch and hopefully soon after that", "17:11", "collect the first plastic and then we", "17:13", "hope to have the the first shipment of", "17:15", "first plastic backpack import before the", "17:19", "end of the year and we think there will", "17:21", "be you know such a symbolic moment for", "17:23", "for sixty years man has been putting", "17:25", "plastic into the ocean and from that", "17:26", "moment onwards we're also taking it back", "17:28", "out again that's amazing and you you", "17:30", "feel like you can get 40 percent of the", "17:32", "Garbage Patch in ten years it's actually", "17:35", "so with a fleet of 60 of these cleanup", "17:37", "systems we should be able to clean up", "17:39", "half this Great Pacific Garbage Patch", "17:41", "every five years which of course more", "17:45", "edible", "17:46", "yeah I mean then you can it's faster if", "17:48", "you want more sis if you'd put in more", "17:49", "systems of course where are you guys", "17:51", "getting funding from um so so far we've", "17:53", "been very generously supported by by", "17:56", "mostly individuals actually so ranging", "17:59", "from people that just donate 50 bucks to", "18:02", "to people like Marc Benioff he's the", "18:04", "founder of Salesforce and a couple of", "18:06", "other very high net worth individuals if", "18:09", "someone wanted to donate how would they", "18:10", "do so yeah just go to the to the website", "18:13", "the ocean clean up calm and feel free to", "18:16", "get in touch with us", "18:17", "so mostly individuals mostly wealthy", "18:20", "philanthropists yeah so that has gotten", "18:23", "us to around thirty five to forty", "18:25", "million dollars right now which has been", "18:28", "enough to fund all these years of", "18:29", "research and development the whole", "18:32", "mapping of the patch as well as the", "18:34", "construction of this first system right", "18:35", "now so so that should get us to the", "18:37", "point where it's a proven technology and", "18:39", "then for the scale-up the idea is that", "18:41", "basically any company can can go and", "18:43", "fund their own system we estimate the", "18:45", "cost of every system to be around five", "18:47", "million basically you the system will be", "18:51", "around a kilometre that's plenty of", "18:53", "space for logos the world is watching so", "18:55", "it's like this massive Bill brand", "18:57", "floating out there so so the idea is", "18:59", "that any company can sort of fund or", "19:01", "individual even from the right system", "19:03", "Nike could be like fuck you adidas we're", "19:05", "doing this for real just kidding adidas", "19:08", "that would be hello yeah it would be", "19:10", "hilarious", "19:10", "yeah so what is the process in taking", "19:13", "the plastic from the ocean and", "19:14", "converting into usable plastic like that", "19:17", "you would use in sunglasses so the first", "19:22", "thing you do is you kind of you wash it", "19:24", "you sort it you scrub it to to get to", "19:27", "Suzy's very clean sort of yeah fragments", "19:31", "of the plastic then we we do there's a", "19:35", "process called compounding where you", "19:36", "sort of remount it and add some some", "19:39", "additives and make it into what you call", "19:41", "pellets so these are sort of these beet", "19:43", "sized particles which can be fed into", "19:46", "any machine in the world so say an Ikea", "19:49", "machine for furniture or Tesla machine", "19:52", "for for cars and yeah so that is and", "19:56", "that process we we can add to custom", "19:57", "develops tailor-made for", "20:00", "for our feet stuck because it's such a", "20:01", "unique composition that's amazing it's", "20:05", "really fascinating because I think that", "20:07", "that will be a hugely desirable form of", "20:12", "construction like if you can prove that", "20:15", "the plastic that you use was made and is", "20:19", "actually it's a benefit to get that", "20:22", "plastic and and and make things out of", "20:24", "it yeah I mean the it's still more", "20:26", "expensive obviously than just normal", "20:29", "plastic sure we have to collect it from", "20:31", "1,200 miles offshore but on the other", "20:35", "hand so so just by selling it as plastic", "20:38", "I don't think that would be a good", "20:40", "business but making into sort of going", "20:42", "further in the value chain up to the the", "20:44", "consumer I think that can make sense", "20:46", "because again to use the sunglass", "20:48", "example it's probably around a hundred", "20:51", "grams of material so that would take", "20:54", "about maybe a dollar to collect and you", "20:58", "know what's a dollar on the hundred and", "21:00", "twenty dollar pair of sunglasses right", "21:02", "so so I think that really going it all", "21:06", "the way up tune in the value chain", "21:07", "that's where you can really add the", "21:09", "value well you know one of the things", "21:11", "that was shocking to me when I was", "21:13", "investigating plastic is that I didn't", "21:15", "know that plastic you can make plastic", "21:17", "out of hemp that hemp plastic is", "21:19", "actually biodegradable yeah and", "21:21", "sugarcane and there are as many sort of", "21:23", "bio-based types of plastic that the", "21:26", "thing is though that there's you know", "21:28", "this is very very sort of complicated", "21:30", "and controversial world of sort of the", "21:32", "bio plastics because you have something", "21:35", "called bio-based and and if somebody got", "21:37", "biodegradable so you can make plastic", "21:40", "out of say sugar cane which is", "21:42", "chemically exactly the same as plastic", "21:45", "that was made from crude oil and it", "21:48", "would take the same amount of time for", "21:50", "it to degrade so bio-based doesn't", "21:53", "necessarily mean that it's biodegradable", "21:55", "and and vice versa", "21:57", "so hmm so it's it's a very complicated", "22:00", "world but even you know sometimes our", "22:03", "experts on this on plastic pollution", "22:05", "being confused about it so let alone", "22:08", "sort of the general population so and", "22:10", "you know in short there isn't yet sort", "22:13", "of", "22:13", "holy grille of this type of plastic that", "22:15", "on one hand is very good in terms of", "22:19", "performance in its usable life and then", "22:22", "when it for example enters the ocean", "22:23", "just degrades in a matter of days or", "22:26", "months so but I think that would be you", "22:29", "know that would be a great innovation is", "22:31", "the quality of biodegradable plastic", "22:33", "inferior to bio-based but non", "22:36", "biodegradable yeah or it's and it's", "22:39", "mostly limited in in the terms of", "22:41", "applications so you can't really", "22:43", "actually plastic does it feel different", "22:46", "to the touch of you yeah so it's it", "22:49", "usually makes more noise it's more sort", "22:52", "of crumbly so it's brittle or something", "22:55", "right mmm interesting well that makes", "22:57", "sense right obviously it's gonna so if", "22:59", "you're gonna make water bottles out of", "23:00", "biodegradable plastic they're probably", "23:02", "gonna leak everywhere yeah yeah that's", "23:04", "yeah but that's not possible yet so", "23:07", "they're compostable that's another thing", "23:08", "you have compostable plastic which which", "23:12", "you can use for water bottles but then", "23:14", "the only way for it to degrade would be", "23:16", "to be in sort of this industrial", "23:18", "composter we have a temperature of a", "23:21", "hundred degrees and and pressure and", "23:23", "things like that and it wouldn't degrade", "23:24", "in the ocean so it's a it's a very", "23:27", "complicated area yeah and I know that", "23:29", "there had Paul Stamets on who's a", "23:32", "mycologist and he was talking about all", "23:35", "the different fungus that could be", "23:38", "potentially engineered to eat plastic", "23:42", "yes another thing that they're working", "23:44", "on yeah so of course it would be great", "23:46", "to have them landfills I think yeah and", "23:49", "actually it's it's it's a process that", "23:51", "were also investigating for recycling", "23:53", "because one thing you could do is you", "23:55", "could take that plastic and then using", "23:57", "either enzymes or indeed fungi and", "24:00", "things like that you could turn it back", "24:01", "into biomass so and from a biomass you", "24:05", "could make anything else again so you", "24:07", "could make bio-based plastic for example", "24:10", "so does this change your relationship", "24:12", "with plastic I mean when you sit there", "24:14", "and you're drinking out of this plastic", "24:15", "bottle do you think I'm gonna have to", "24:17", "clean this fucking thing up someday yeah", "24:22", "yeah but on the other animals are not", "24:25", "against plastic because I realized", "24:27", "without plastic say modern medicine", "24:30", "would be very difficult not plastic a", "24:33", "lot more food waste would be produced", "24:36", "and without plastic we wouldn't be able", "24:38", "to clean the ocean because actually a", "24:39", "lot of the components of our cleanup", "24:41", "system actually maybe can pull up an", "24:43", "image of the thing being built right now", "24:45", "yeah please terrorism so that's actually", "24:47", "a lot of the parts of that are made out", "24:49", "of out of plastic so so it's kind of", "24:53", "ironic yeah it's portable is yeah yeah", "24:56", "so here it is so fin fire with fire so", "25:01", "yes I don't think we can live without", "25:04", "plastic and I don't think we should want", "25:06", "to I think it's really just about", "25:08", "managing the material in a way that it", "25:10", "doesn't end up in the ocean which means", "25:12", "that an ad comes back to the material", "25:14", "being valuable enough at the end of life", "25:16", "because if if it's cheaper to recycle", "25:20", "then to not recycle well then obviously", "25:21", "it would happen mm-hmm and there needs", "25:24", "to be good infrastructure for that and", "25:26", "then I think as a final of a final", "25:29", "safety net we need technologies like", "25:31", "this to to sort of intercept it in river", "25:34", "mouths as well sort of clean up the", "25:36", "legacy of the sixty years that we're", "25:37", "having in the middle of the ocean but I", "25:39", "don't think we can live with that", "25:40", "plastic no I don't think so either not", "25:42", "yet and are when you're looking at the", "25:45", "water and you see the plastic that is in", "25:48", "this Pacific Garbage Patch on the other", "25:49", "the other four patches how deep does", "25:51", "that plastic go from the surface so so", "25:55", "most of the plastic really stays on or", "25:58", "near the surface so we've we've done", "26:00", "expeditions to that for that too to", "26:02", "measure it and that's actually why our", "26:04", "system only goes three meters deep", "26:06", "because that's so below that there's", "26:09", "virtually no plastic anymore interesting", "26:11", "so it's only about nine feet so when", "26:13", "you're when your trunk when you see the", "26:15", "little tiny itty bitty pieces yeah it", "26:18", "seems like as the plastic breaks down", "26:20", "over decades it becomes like almost like", "26:22", "a gelatinous sort of chunky thing yeah", "26:26", "it's called micro plastics you've sort", "26:29", "of these particles that look a bit", "26:31", "almost like grains of sand right which", "26:33", "are really small even those we measured", "26:36", "are primarily in those top three meters", "26:39", "or", "26:41", "so and another surprising finding I", "26:44", "think from from those expeditions was", "26:46", "that still more than 99% of the plastic", "26:49", "is larger than a millimeter so larger", "26:53", "than those those very tiny pieces which", "26:55", "means that on one hand I think that's", "26:58", "good news because that means it's it's", "27:00", "not too late because obviously the", "27:02", "smaller to get the more harmful they get", "27:03", "they end up in the food chain but they", "27:06", "also are harder to clean up right so so", "27:09", "it's on one end it's not too late so", "27:11", "it's the good the good news I think but", "27:13", "on the other hand it also means that", "27:15", "there's still 99% of plastic out there", "27:18", "that over the next few decades will", "27:21", "become micro plastics as well if we", "27:23", "don't clean it up so there's sort of", "27:25", "this ticking time bomb out there that if", "27:28", "we just leave it there the amount of", "27:30", "micro plastics could increase over a", "27:32", "hundred fold over the next few decades", "27:33", "and then we would be in a much worse", "27:37", "situation than we are today", "27:38", "so have marine biologists done Studies", "27:41", "on the impact in that particular area in", "27:44", "terms of populations of fish and marine", "27:46", "life yes so so there's many species that", "27:50", "that are being affected from one side", "27:54", "due to ingestion on the on the other", "27:56", "side through entanglement so actually", "27:59", "another finding over study was that", "28:00", "almost half of the plastic by mass is", "28:03", "things like ropes and and fishing net", "28:06", "mm-hmm which of course disastrous well", "28:08", "first of all four propellers four four", "28:10", "boats that go out there oh look at that", "28:12", "photo indeed so aerial photo of a turtle", "28:17", "that mean it looks like it's caught in a", "28:19", "bush it's just this massive net that", "28:22", "this thing is swimming around with this", "28:24", "thing attached to his body that's one of", "28:26", "the things that I was going to ask you", "28:27", "about is cleaning up the nets because we", "28:31", "had talked to someone that was", "28:32", "explaining that every time they fish a", "28:35", "lot of times they'll cut the Nets loose", "28:37", "yeah so it's pretty combination of", "28:40", "accidental loss and in and intentional", "28:44", "loss but yeah I mean this this the", "28:46", "amount of nets really was quite quite", "28:49", "staggering and did you do you remember", "28:51", "who was bringing that up Jamie", "28:53", "somebody somebody brought that up that", "28:54", "they just released the nets and that", "28:57", "it's commonplace and it was stunning cuz", "28:59", "we were like what every time they do", "29:01", "that yeah the nets get caught and you", "29:04", "know they get damaged so they just cut", "29:05", "the nets loose yeah and the nets are", "29:07", "plastic too so but that's insane that", "29:09", "that's legal that they do that that they", "29:11", "don't have yeah it's not legal but it's", "29:13", "not illegal no but so they're lost for", "29:16", "this but obviously how do you know that", "29:18", "people do this right very hard to to", "29:20", "monitor yeah I mean I guess you should", "29:24", "probably have some sort of a GPS", "29:26", "tracking on your net yeah I mean that", "29:28", "could be one thing or you could think", "29:30", "about need market-based solutions where", "29:33", "there would be a financial incentive", "29:34", "know if they bring their their nets to", "29:36", "shore yeah", "29:37", "then some sort of a penalization if they", "29:40", "don't what is this Jamie the impact and", "29:43", "abandoned ocean fishing nets on marine", "29:45", "life I've been Kris Reiner Duncan okay", "29:47", "that makes sense Google says oh man that", "29:51", "is just so it's so sad that it's such a", "29:54", "wasteful dismissive sort of thing to do", "29:59", "just cut it loose and huh it's gone yes", "30:02", "in the ocean no worries", "30:04", "sure so that's I mean that's a very", "30:06", "obvious kind of impact and then another", "30:09", "thing that was also study done by us", "30:11", "recently so we looked at the the", "30:14", "concentrations of plastic versus", "30:16", "naturally-occurring marine life in this", "30:18", "Garbage Patch and then what we saw was", "30:20", "that there is a hundred and eighty times", "30:23", "more plastic at the surface than sort of", "30:26", "natural food for for birds and for", "30:28", "turtles and things like that so you can", "30:30", "imagine if you are a turtle at the", "30:32", "surface of this Garbage Patch and you", "30:34", "sort of take a bite to eat there's 180", "30:37", "times larger chance that you eat plastic", "30:40", "rather than a piece of plankton right", "30:42", "right and what we found was that this", "30:44", "this concentration is so high that it", "30:46", "can actually have this this chemical", "30:48", "impact where where these chemicals have", "30:51", "a potential health impact on these", "30:53", "organisms as well as species further up", "30:57", "the food food web including us humans so", "31:00", "have we noticed that have people been", "31:03", "tested and shown to", "31:06", "I've ingested plastic that they've", "31:08", "gotten through eating tuna or something", "31:11", "like that so the plastic itself isn't", "31:13", "the thing that chemicals yes chemicals", "31:16", "that attach to the plastic and for", "31:19", "example you see is that for example in", "31:22", "Greenland like the the Native", "31:24", "communities that really rely on fish", "31:25", "they have much higher cancer rates they", "31:28", "have much higher concentrations of", "31:31", "mercury so other heavy metals as well as", "31:34", "these persistent organic pollutants", "31:36", "these things that attach to the press to", "31:38", "the plastic in Greenland", "31:40", "yeah like the like these sort of these", "31:42", "Native communities that rely on fish and", "31:45", "another sea life so they're to eat this", "31:48", "is a recent trend that they have higher", "31:49", "rates of cancer yeah I don't know how", "31:52", "recent it is but probably past few", "31:55", "decades I can imagine but yeah that's", "31:57", "really linked to their their marine", "32:00", "their consumption of marine sources but", "32:04", "you know obviously it's hard to say well", "32:06", "how many percent of that is just heavy", "32:08", "metals yeah versus for what's coming by", "32:11", "plastic but sure if you yeah if you look", "32:14", "at the kind of chemicals and you look at", "32:16", "the lab tests that they've done with", "32:18", "that those chemicals yeah they are not", "32:20", "very good for you now I've heard that if", "32:22", "you leave a water bottle like this in", "32:24", "your car and it gets hot out that the", "32:27", "water will plastic will leach into the", "32:30", "waters are correct yeah so I think it", "32:33", "depends on the kind of plastic but you", "32:35", "have I think with this you pray the", "32:37", "liner would contain like salads and", "32:39", "things like that so yeah I wouldn't do", "32:43", "that", "32:43", "so there's you know when you look at", "32:45", "those chemicals you have if two kinds of", "32:47", "things you should I think worry but one", "32:49", "is the chemicals that are actually in", "32:51", "the plastic and secondly there's these", "32:53", "chemicals that just float around in the", "32:55", "ocean and then can attach to the plastic", "32:58", "when they yeah because they sort of act", "33:01", "like this chemical sponge the plastic", "33:03", "wants to repel water and those chemicals", "33:05", "too so they kind of act like a magnet", "33:07", "towards each other especially the latter", "33:10", "one is it's well studied and we see that", "33:12", "a lot on the on the on the plastic but", "33:15", "the the the former one yeah I mean it's", "33:18", "even an issue here if", "33:20", "your car for them it's an issue in your", "33:22", "car like how so yeah well if you leave", "33:24", "it like in a hot car and write right now", "33:26", "a question was is even if you're", "33:30", "scooping out all that plastic out of the", "33:32", "ocean is it still leaving chemicals that", "33:36", "will we'll never be able to get out so I", "33:39", "think the chemicals mostly actually it", "33:42", "collects more chemicals than it sort of", "33:44", "leeches at so because of those those", "33:48", "sort of legacy chemicals like the PCBs", "33:51", "and DDT sort of things that were used", "33:54", "for insulators and pesticides back into", "34:00", "maybe the 40s to 60s so these these", "34:05", "actually the plastic attracts those", "34:08", "chemicals so in a way you can have also", "34:11", "remove a bit of those chemicals and we", "34:12", "actually have to wash them out before we", "34:14", "do the recycling because you don't want", "34:16", "those in your your products so there's", "34:18", "actually some sort of a benefit to", "34:19", "having those plastics in the water I", "34:21", "mean not yet you would encourage people", "34:22", "to put water but there is some some", "34:25", "natural benefit um yeah I mean it's sort", "34:28", "of yeah I mean I I cannot really say how", "34:32", "many percent of those legacy chemicals", "34:34", "we would be pulling out with the plastic", "34:36", "but yeah I mean you could say you could", "34:38", "argue it's sort of an added benefit to", "34:40", "removing it not to having plastic in", "34:42", "right now have you extended this line of", "34:46", "thinking to some of the other problems", "34:48", "in the ocean like these heavy metals", "34:51", "well so what I really hope is that the", "34:53", "area cleanup can sort of become a symbol", "34:55", "of how we should use how we should use", "34:59", "technology to solve problems of our time", "35:02", "so when you and I think a lot of it", "35:05", "comes down to that we shouldn't sort of", "35:08", "protest what we shouldn't agree with but", "35:10", "we should build the things we should", "35:12", "build a future that we do agree with so", "35:15", "when you look at the past few hundred", "35:17", "years of modernity in our civilization", "35:22", "what we see is dramatic positive trends", "35:25", "in terms of health wealth education", "35:28", "violence and we get Steven Pinker on", "35:31", "your show so I think that's", "35:34", "really positive trends and we've done a", "35:37", "good job in that and that all comes down", "35:40", "to our ability to sort of imagine things", "35:44", "that don't exist yet so sort of", "35:46", "technology and innovation and being able", "35:49", "to work work together in an effective", "35:52", "way which is think about the corporation", "35:55", "so I think those have been a sort of", "35:59", "very good trends and I think what we", "36:01", "should do is we should also think about", "36:03", "how to apply those to the area outside", "36:06", "of our own species and to the rest of", "36:09", "the environment because when you look at", "36:11", "all those positive trends over the past", "36:12", "few hundred years and then you know that", "36:16", "that's so good but there's one very big", "36:18", "exception which is the impact to the", "36:20", "environment it's almost like we've had", "36:22", "all the success at the cost of the", "36:24", "environment and but I think that instead", "36:26", "of there are some people that have sort", "36:29", "of a more reactionary feel to this and", "36:32", "they say well look at all these problems", "36:35", "it was created by businesses and by", "36:38", "technology so we should stay as far away", "36:40", "from those things as possible and I", "36:42", "think that's sort of you know that's", "36:44", "sort of stupid I think that it really", "36:48", "just shows that these are very powerful", "36:51", "ways of getting things done and I think", "36:53", "a much more effective way was to apply", "36:56", "that what has worked in other areas and", "36:58", "then also apply that to the area of the", "37:01", "environment so so I don't think you know", "37:03", "I for example think that the car problem", "37:05", "is not going to be solved by banning", "37:07", "cars I think it's going to be solved by", "37:08", "electric cars and I don't think the the", "37:11", "meat pollution problem is going to be", "37:13", "solved by everyone becoming vegan I", "37:15", "think it's going to be solved by things", "37:17", "like lab-grown meat and and other kind", "37:19", "of alternatives so and that's why I also", "37:23", "think that yeah the urgent cleanup or", "37:25", "the plastic pollution problem is not", "37:27", "going to be solved by sort of people", "37:29", "trying to do their own little bit and", "37:32", "you know trying to live without plastic", "37:34", "or things like that I think is going to", "37:36", "be solved by you know things like", "37:39", "plastics that do not harm to the", "37:42", "environment as well as technologies like", "37:44", "the OSHA clean up to sort of clean up", "37:46", "after ourselves", "37:48", "yeah and I hope that the airship can be", "37:50", "sort of as some a symbol of that", "37:52", "approach I like what you just said there", "37:54", "because I've always thought that", "37:56", "technology will most likely sort out", "38:00", "most of these issues if we apply enough", "38:03", "attention to it and that one of the real", "38:06", "issues is when someone creates some sort", "38:07", "of a new technology they really don't", "38:09", "have the ability to see 50 years down", "38:12", "the line what's going to happen with the", "38:14", "side effects the residual effects and I", "38:17", "think that's that's a big part of what", "38:18", "happened with plastic and I don't think", "38:20", "the solution is you know making an axe", "38:22", "out of a piece of rock and living in the", "38:24", "woods breasts I think that the solution", "38:26", "is trying to have a long-term", "38:29", "comprehensive approach to how we use", "38:32", "various technologies and also various", "38:35", "resources so that we don't have another", "38:38", "Pacific Garbage Patch in some new", "38:40", "technology 50 hundred two hundred years", "38:42", "from now I mean if you went to the ocean", "38:44", "200 years ago you would see none of this", "38:46", "now this is a very very very recent", "38:49", "issue that's compounding at a staggering", "38:51", "rate sure yeah so I agree with what you", "38:55", "say there and you know it's yeah it's", "38:59", "really just about so I don't think I", "39:02", "think there's a lot of people that think", "39:04", "that technology is inherently neutral", "39:06", "like it's not good or bad but I think", "39:08", "that's not true if you like compare I", "39:11", "know some bio terrorist weapon which you", "39:14", "could event or you could invent a", "39:15", "machine to clean the ocean I would say I", "39:17", "would argue those are not equally good", "39:20", "things to develop so when technology", "39:23", "isn't inherently neutral it means it's", "39:26", "sort of deterministic so the inventor", "39:28", "kind of puts a certain direction in the", "39:32", "product already and I think that can be", "39:34", "used in our advantage or to phrase it", "39:37", "differently I think there is a", "39:38", "responsibility at with inventors and", "39:41", "entrepreneurs to to build things that", "39:44", "are more good than than bad and actually", "39:46", "plastic I would still argue that plastic", "39:49", "is a net positive technology and it was", "39:51", "once invented as a solution it saves a", "39:55", "lot of weights a lot of people got hurt", "39:57", "when when people use glass bottles and", "39:59", "things like that", "40:00", "back in the day this was invented as a", "40:03", "as a solution but it has this negative", "40:06", "side effects and then I think we should", "40:07", "now think about well what technologies", "40:10", "can we develop to manage that negative", "40:12", "side effect and probably those have", "40:14", "again a small negative side effect but", "40:17", "you can think about it like a", "40:18", "compounding sort of staircase of of net", "40:22", "positive technologies I think eventually", "40:24", "that's how we can actually solve these", "40:26", "problems so in this country there's a", "40:29", "tremendous amount of recycling but how", "40:32", "effective is that recycling yeah I think", "40:35", "the amount of recycling is actually", "40:37", "pretty lonely in the u.s. compared to to", "40:39", "other countries we always do everything", "40:42", "better over here yeah what countries the", "40:46", "best at it huh I think like Germany or", "40:49", "Switzerland that's kind of country", "40:51", "they're really one and what do they do", "40:53", "differently they just I think they just", "40:55", "put more money in it and I think most of", "40:59", "the waste in the u.s. is actually being", "41:00", "land filled so and what used to be", "41:04", "recycled like she was sent to China but", "41:07", "now like I think this year last year", "41:08", "China said well no we don't want your", "41:10", "waste anymore so so now I think there", "41:13", "will be a lot of investments in new", "41:14", "recycling facilities in the US now how", "41:17", "does that get recycle okay if you use", "41:19", "this water bottle and you empty and then", "41:22", "you throw it in the recycle container", "41:23", "what happens so yeah I mean very much", "41:28", "depends on the location but to just use", "41:32", "an example of where I live in back in", "41:35", "Holland so they yeah they you actually", "41:38", "they collect the plastic separately then", "41:41", "it goes to a facility where they sort", "41:44", "the different kinds of plastic they get", "41:46", "out all the contaminants and make them", "41:49", "into two new pellets and the problem", "41:52", "there is really the lack of demand for", "41:55", "recycled plastic because I think a lot", "41:57", "of companies that build products because", "42:01", "basically virgins a new plastic is so", "42:03", "cheap they'd rather just do what they're", "42:06", "used to and", "42:08", "not they don't want to see any risks", "42:11", "with their materials so they just choose", "42:13", "for the safe option the the new kind of", "42:16", "plastic so I think if you want to do if", "42:18", "you want to promote recycling I would", "42:20", "actually say well promote the use of", "42:23", "recycled material because as long if", "42:25", "there's a demand then you know the price", "42:26", "will go up and then automatically more", "42:29", "recycling would happen", "42:31", "yeah there's very little demand for", "42:33", "recycled plastic like it's not something", "42:35", "that you hear about on a regular basis", "42:36", "like people that are clamoring to get", "42:38", "only recycled plastic yeah and I think", "42:40", "that I think maybe that's that could be", "42:43", "another nice side effect of what we do", "42:45", "because yeah we can kind of make this", "42:47", "sort of recycled plastic a bit more sexy", "42:50", "yeah perfect yeah I think that's exactly", "42:55", "what it is have you extended this line", "42:57", "of thinking to other environmental", "42:59", "concerns like you know pollution in", "43:02", "terms of like chemical spills and", "43:05", "pollution in the air and things along", "43:06", "those lines yeah I have quite a few more", "43:11", "ideas I would say but yeah I would", "43:14", "really really wouldn't be good for the", "43:17", "ocean cleanup if I would get distracted", "43:18", "saying well I want you to farm those", "43:20", "ideas off to other people because I", "43:21", "think guys like you are insanely", "43:23", "valuable like that one person really did", "43:26", "sort of germinate this seed and get this", "43:30", "project moving it's it's very unusual", "43:31", "outliers like yourself you very humble", "43:34", "guy I'm sure you don't think of yourself", "43:35", "in an outlier but you most certainly are", "43:37", "it's one of the most valuable things", "43:39", "about civilizations the occasional", "43:42", "person who steps out amongst the masses", "43:44", "and does something pretty radical that", "43:46", "almost everybody around them was aware", "43:49", "was an issue and that's what you're", "43:50", "doing yeah I think there could be much", "43:53", "more people that do things like that", "43:55", "yeah I think I would think so but I", "43:56", "don't see it that's what it's so", "43:58", "fascinating about guys like you is that", "44:00", "this is not a very common thing to do", "44:04", "yeah but it's a very common problem yeah", "44:06", "well maybe that's because when you hear", "44:09", "about people doing cool cool shit it's", "44:13", "usually when they're already sort of", "44:15", "doing those things and it's not when", "44:17", "they kind of started thinking about this", "44:19", "so then I guess people could be", "44:21", "intimidated", "44:22", "like how I don't know how to run a", "44:24", "company of 100 people I don't know how", "44:26", "to I don't had to get these things done", "44:29", "but you know when I look back at myself", "44:32", "four or five years ago I I I really", "44:35", "didn't have a bloody clue of what I was", "44:38", "doing well you were a baby yeah five", "44:44", "years ago you know 18 yeah yeah", "44:48", "that's a baby I wasn't even born yet no", "44:50", "so so but that really doesn't matter I", "44:53", "mean it's it's about just getting", "44:54", "started Sean and being willing to learn", "44:58", "and just you know being open to feedback", "45:00", "and just trying many different things", "45:02", "and seeing what works and what doesn't", "45:03", "work if especially the beginning of done", "45:05", "like hundreds of things that didn't work", "45:07", "yeah the first time I tried fundraising", "45:11", "I send a cold email to three hundred", "45:12", "companies and asked to ask for", "45:14", "sponsorship and I think one replied and", "45:16", "said this is a horrible idea you should", "45:19", "go back to school so so that wasn't", "45:21", "right that one yeah", "45:23", "put that one on your wall I will do that", "45:26", "it's a good idea so so that was very", "45:28", "successful and then you know I tried", "45:30", "crowdfunding and raised a few million", "45:32", "bucks and allowed us to get started so", "45:34", "yeah so it's just about sort of doing", "45:37", "this trial and error it so just like we", "45:39", "developed a technology in a very", "45:40", "iterative session it's also about just", "45:43", "developing yourself I think in an", "45:44", "iterative fashion and and sort of just", "45:46", "just get started", "45:48", "well what my point being is that when", "45:50", "someone like you does make something", "45:52", "happen and once you get the ball rolling", "45:54", "you can be a catalyst for so many other", "45:57", "projects getting launched because if", "45:59", "you're attached to you like you're a", "46:01", "person like you've got the fire yeah", "46:04", "you've got the fire so you put the fire", "46:06", "over here now this fire will start here", "46:08", "let me bring an ember to this this", "46:10", "project this can start and it seems to", "46:12", "me that getting that fire getting that", "46:15", "initial ember is one of those difficult", "46:16", "aspects in creating any sort of", "46:18", "technology in turn especially in terms", "46:21", "of something so complex where you're", "46:24", "extracting things that are potentially", "46:27", "dangerous from the environment and", "46:28", "creating a net positive effect and then", "46:30", "using that plastic to recycle there's so", "46:32", "much good car", "46:34", "lack of a better word attached to", "46:36", "something like that and and for a person", "46:39", "like me when I hear that your sunglasses", "46:41", "are made from the Pacific Garbage Patch", "46:43", "I get excited I'm like ooh where can i", "46:45", "buy these fucking sunglasses next year", "46:47", "yeah well I'll buy them that that that", "46:50", "does get exciting to people so it seems", "46:52", "to me that this excitement that you're", "46:54", "bringing is contagious and you could", "46:57", "potentially use it to spread other ideas", "47:02", "that could also be environmentally", "47:04", "positive yeah well I certainly hope that", "47:06", "other people will think about sort of", "47:07", "what kind of the ocean cleanup can I", "47:09", "build which isn't cleaning plastic from", "47:12", "the ocean so so I hope people sort of", "47:14", "already do that but yeah I mean it's a", "47:17", "good good point I should sort of think", "47:19", "about sort of what to do with these", "47:22", "other ideas like yeah few of them are", "47:24", "sort of so excited about that I kind of", "47:26", "want to do them myself eventually which", "47:29", "would ya not be in the next few years", "47:31", "but pretty yeah do you have like a", "47:34", "long-term plan for all this stuff what", "47:37", "are you gonna do if you the oceans are", "47:39", "all beautiful and blue you like it I do", "47:42", "and the goal is really to help ourselves", "47:44", "out of business right so one day we hope", "47:46", "we're done I don't want to be the", "47:48", "garbage man of the ocean forever so so", "47:55", "the to be the target that we set for the", "47:58", "ocean cleanup was to really get to a 90%", "47:59", "reduction by by 2040 which is that's", "48:03", "incredible I think is achievable both on", "48:06", "the influx side and the Dastak side but", "48:10", "yeah so but I think that already before", "48:13", "that I think it and if maybe yeah five", "48:17", "years from now it will just be sort of", "48:19", "steady operation and then for me it", "48:22", "wouldn't be very exciting anymore it's I", "48:24", "would be involved until really the end", "48:29", "but maybe yeah maybe at some point in", "48:32", "time I would be able to just sort of", "48:35", "brought on my time of a multiple project", "48:37", "but that's yeah that's at least years", "48:39", "away because yeah of course there's", "48:42", "still a lot of things that need to", "48:43", "happen we need to first prove the", "48:45", "technology is first and foremost", "48:48", "shir then we have to scale up raise", "48:52", "hundreds of millions to to build this", "48:53", "entire fleet out then there for more", "48:56", "patches in the world we need to make it", "48:59", "into a self sustainable business and", "49:01", "then we also need to think about what", "49:02", "can we do on the source side so so", "49:05", "there's quite a few pieces of the puzzle", "49:06", "still there to be to be found and put", "49:09", "together yeah so I won't be bored for", "49:13", "the next few years for sure you", "49:14", "certainly won't be one of the reasons", "49:16", "why I'm asking this about you and what", "49:19", "your ideas are with cleaning up other", "49:22", "problems in the world that's because", "49:24", "there's millions of people listening to", "49:26", "this and there might be another Boyan", "49:28", "out there who's a young kid who says", "49:31", "well why don't we do this yeah how come", "49:34", "this hasn't been done or why why isn't", "49:36", "someone tried this and next thing you", "49:38", "know because someone who's figuring out", "49:40", "how to extract heavy metals out of the", "49:42", "bottom of the ocean sure I think the", "49:44", "thing that would be will be great and", "49:46", "yeah I definitely welcome people to sort", "49:50", "of just just start and yeah what kind of", "49:54", "other thoughts well I think another", "49:56", "thing that's important then when people", "49:58", "try and solve problems is that they", "50:01", "actually think about how to solve the", "50:03", "problem I think there's a lot of people", "50:05", "that are very very well-meaning and they", "50:09", "don't want to get involved but then what", "50:11", "happens is that they sort of think about", "50:15", "so at least I can kind of make a dent", "50:17", "and then hopefully that dent sort of", "50:18", "grows and but I think what's what a lot", "50:21", "of people forget to do is that when they", "50:23", "sort of start tackling a problem they", "50:26", "forget to sort of look at the whole", "50:28", "problem first and see well sort of", "50:30", "what's required to actually solve the", "50:32", "whole problem and then sort of reason", "50:35", "your way back to well what's the first", "50:37", "step that I need to take because if you", "50:39", "don't do that well then I think it will", "50:42", "be very hard to kind of get the scale", "50:44", "you need to actually sort of solve solve", "50:47", "the problem so and it's yeah I can", "50:50", "imagine can be quite intimidating to to", "50:51", "think about that but yeah I think that", "50:54", "would get us to much more sort of", "50:57", "effective solutions to sort of this sort", "51:00", "of", "51:01", "top-down problem-solving as I would call", "51:02", "it instead of sort of this bottom-up sub", "51:05", "protocell so when have you talked to", "51:09", "anybody that also had an idea of how to", "51:11", "clean up the Pacific Garbage Patch now", "51:15", "I've read about other proposals from the", "51:18", "past for sure but no one is really", "51:20", "actively pursued anything I don't know", "51:24", "well I mean the thing is of course all", "51:26", "those other ideas were based on sort of", "51:28", "boats and nets that would go fishing", "51:30", "that's like taking 79 thousand years for", "51:33", "fridges one patch there was one that I", "51:35", "saw that looked like some gigantic", "51:37", "floating thing it looked like a", "51:39", "spaceship and it was kind of like moving", "51:41", "across the surface sort of skimming it", "51:44", "is that one of those kids see actually", "51:47", "the some artists impression of what I", "51:49", "refer to earlier concept yeah I think", "51:51", "that's probably silver yeah that was", "51:55", "yeah so what other I mean if you don't", "51:58", "mind talking about them what other ideas", "52:00", "have you had in terms of like cleaning", "52:02", "things up yeah I've kind of ever been to", "52:06", "to talk about them but I mean there's", "52:08", "there's things you have other problems", "52:10", "out there so if you just think about so", "52:12", "what other big problems are out there so", "52:14", "how about water pollution", "52:18", "yeah I usually so what I do is actually", "52:22", "I try and actively force the ideas out", "52:25", "of my head just because sort of once you", "52:27", "have an idea it sort of starts to grow", "52:29", "and then sometimes you know with any", "52:32", "project you're doing there are these", "52:33", "weeks that things don't go very well and", "52:35", "sort of everything seems to be against", "52:37", "you and in those weeks as oh it's very", "52:40", "tempting to started thinking about well", "52:42", "there's other idea and you know and sort", "52:45", "of starts to grow and you should be", "52:47", "careful that doesn't take over your", "52:49", "entire mind feeling too scattered and", "52:51", "spread out yeah so I think it's of", "52:54", "paramount importance for the this for", "52:57", "the og claim to happen is that I stay a", "52:59", "hundred percent focused on what we do if", "53:01", "there's one mission rid the areas of", "53:02", "plastic and that's what we're doing so", "53:05", "what I usually do is I sort of write", "53:07", "them down in my notebook", "53:10", "to keep it next to my bed and that's", "53:12", "where it stays until you know a few", "53:15", "years from now so probably when you were", "53:18", "to ask me like so what's the top three", "53:20", "ideas other ideas you have I wouldn't be", "53:22", "able to wouldn't even be able to say", "53:25", "them because yeah they're sort of out of", "53:27", "my head and then I really try to keep it", "53:29", "there but I mean what's what I can say", "53:33", "is that they're all sort of", "53:35", "technology-based so they're all things", "53:36", "that aren't possible now but I want to", "53:38", "make possible in the future and I sort", "53:42", "of all think connected in terms of", "53:45", "negative side effects of yeah of", "53:48", "civilization and trying to sort of yeah", "53:52", "make sure that that doesn't backfire to", "53:54", "us what I was like to do is I tried to", "53:57", "think like if we sort of try to imagine", "54:01", "a future in 10,000 years from now how do", "54:04", "we make sure that well civilization is", "54:09", "there but zooming out humanity's still", "54:11", "there zooming further out just you know", "54:13", "general life can can prosper and yeah", "54:18", "when I look at if I try to extrapolate", "54:21", "the current situation to the next 10,000", "54:24", "years I don't think we're at that point", "54:26", "yet but I think it's yeah it's a", "54:29", "challenge that we'll have to see so well", "54:31", "it's certainly a challenge that we're", "54:32", "gonna have to solve and a challenge that", "54:35", "I would hope more people like you tackle", "54:38", "and start approaching these issues with", "54:41", "the sort of 10,000 year mindset a big", "54:44", "one of course with the ocean is", "54:46", "overfishing yeah for sure yeah I mean", "54:51", "one thing", "54:52", "so right now you have cuddle of", "54:54", "excitement and those startups in the", "54:56", "area of of artificial meat right yeah", "55:02", "why not artificial fish fish meat right", "55:05", "because there seems to

wasted and on", "55:24", "land where kind of is stage 2 now so", "55:27", "going to stage 3 protein next few", "55:30", "decades and but if you look at fishing", "55:32", "it's still just hunting right he's still", "55:34", "just wildcard most most most fish", "55:37", "there's some farm raised", "55:38", "yeah it's also maybe not as valuable or", "55:40", "is healthy yeah and I think they also", "55:43", "use a lot of wild caught fish as a", "55:46", "feedstock for these farmed fish that's", "55:47", "kind of odd but yeah but that seems to", "55:52", "be served as mentor evolution so I think", "55:53", "that would be a way to to kind of solve", "55:57", "that and but isn't there a potential I", "56:01", "mean if we're looking at this in terms", "56:02", "of long term of what we've done with", "56:04", "plastic and the downside there's", "56:06", "potential downsides to even this", "56:08", "lab-grown stuff like we don't know", "56:10", "really the health consequences of",

"56:22", "and we need to look carefully at this", "56:27", "but I think Andy's on paper does I have", "56:30", "a lot of potential of being able to do", "56:31", "more with less yeah I'm gonna wait for a", "56:33", "while yeah I just I don't know it just", "56:38", "seems to me like boy this could be one", "56:40", "of those early adopter things it could", "56:42", "be a disaster", "56:44",

the", "57:15", "example like earlier this week I was", "57:17", "driving", "57:19", "a Tesla on autopilot and it's driving it", "57:25", "for five minutes and then already you're", "57:27", "kind of

"57:43", "some homeless lady who steps out off the", "57:44", "median now yeah like she one day this", "57:48", "thing that did happen yeah with the uber", "57:51", "car yeah yeah it's I think this thing's", "57:56", "like this will come up more rapidly than", "57:58", "people think and I think I think very", "58:01", "very quickly that we used to it but", "58:03", "aren't you're supposed to like look at", "58:05", "the road right not supposed to be", "58:06", "staring down at your laptop yeah okay", "58:08", "just erase everything that minute have", "58:12", "you ever seen the video of the guys", "58:13", "falling asleep in San Francisco traffic", "58:15", "no he's completely asleep he's behind", "58:18", "the wheel - Tesla like this and the car", "58:21", "is like slowing and going with the pace", "58:22", "of traffic it's really fascinating", "58:24", "because this happened so quickly I", "58:27", "remember a buddy of mine got a Tesla a", "58:30", "couple years ago and he's like dude I", "58:31", "let my hands off the wheel on the", "58:33", "highway I'm like really like that's", "58:35", "happening already but it's not just", "58:37", "happening like people plug into their", "58:38", "navigate here this guy look at them this", "58:40", "guy is", "58:41", "stone dead asleep in his Tesla in", "58:45", "bumper-to-bumper San Francisco traffic", "58:47", "in the car is performing flawlessly and", "58:50", "this is this Dutch guy who actually just", "58:52", "went to the back of his like on the", "58:54", "backseat and started changing his", "58:56", "clothes and oh god yeah and then", "58:58", "apparently that did they now included a", "59:00", "safety feature that you can I have to", "59:02", "touch the wheel every minute or so oh", "59:03", "that's a new thing", "59:05", "yeah yeah and BMW I believe has a", "59:07", "similar system but you have to have your", "59:09", "hand on the wheel at all times", "59:10", "yeah pretty better until it's yeah yeah", "59:14", "yeah I would imagine yeah people", "59:16", "probably doing all kinds of freaky shit", "59:18", "in their cars while this thing is on", "59:19", "autopilot it's really don't right now", "59:20", "yeah it's quite amazing how I mean", "59:23", "there's you're just about to show a", "59:25", "video of Tesla autopilot", "59:27", "crash compilations hey it's saving", "59:29", "people from crashes", "59:32", "I'm sure it does what's unbelievable is", "59:36", "how few crashes there are and they said", "59:37", "they've been two fatalities so far okay", "59:39", "how many fatalities per capita versus", "59:43", "non auto pilot cars yeah I mean I would", "59:47", "imagine it's far less yeah obviously", "59:49", "these cars are also just safer in", "59:51", "general so they're not there's much", "59:53", "safer than that in a 1990s Toyota", "59:57", "Corolla or something so in terms of the", "59:58", "way the construction", "59:59", "yeah just safer when they crash so right", "60:02", "I don't know how they compared the syste", "60:03", "statistics but yeah I'm I'm very", "60:08", "impressed too it was fun trying it out", "60:10", "yeah I'm impressed and I'm very hopeful", "60:12", "the only my only concern I had my friend", "60:14", "Matt Farah was on last week and he's a", "60:16", "car expert and they've actually started", "60:18", "an organization to save human driving", "60:21", "there they're literally going to be like", "60:24", "lobbyists - yeah stop law doesn't get", "60:28", "bent", "60:29", "yeah well that's the concern is that one", "60:31", "day they're gonna say you cannot drive", "60:33", "your own car and they're really worried", "60:36", "that that was the name of his", "60:37", "organization do you remember okay but", "60:41", "the the you know they're very serious", "60:43", "he's like it's going to happen quicker", "60:45", "than you think you're going it's going", "60:47", "to be very difficult to drive your own", "60:48", "car and then it's going to be illegal", "60:50", "yeah maybe they should keep area it's", "60:53", "like the highway one or thing like that", "60:55", "it's just something some freaky Road", "60:56", "people can get crazy look at hey man I'm", "60:58", "steering", "60:59", "yeah I'm hitting my own brakes oh yeah I", "61:02", "mean again these are things that it's", "61:06", "most likely inevitable I mean this this", "61:08", "technology the way it's progressing it's", "61:10", "going to be safer it's going to be", "61:11", "healthier lower emissions all these", "61:13", "variables they're gonna come into play", "61:14", "where people are going to say no this", "61:16", "just there's the benefit of driving your", "61:18", "own cars not worth the detriment to", "61:20", "society yeah and next to that just if", "61:25", "you think about the the normal rate of", "61:27", "converting the entire car fleet to", "61:30", "electric it would be around 20 years", "61:32", "because that's sort of how long cars", "61:34", "last and right you only produce a few", "61:36", "hundred million cars a year and there's", "61:37", "billions of cars so said you know if you", "61:40", "don't want that to take twenty years", "61:42", "well I think autonomy then really has to", "61:44", "come into play because", "61:46", "if you have autonomous cars you need", "61:48", "much less cars out there and then you", "61:50", "would if they you would have to drive", "61:52", "themselves because obviously cars are", "61:54", "just driving maybe 3% of their time", "61:57", "there this time there they're just being", "62:00", "parked so they can drive themselves", "62:02", "I think the utilization of the number of", "62:04", "cars would be much higher and I think", "62:07", "that all transition to electric cars", "62:09", "would happen much faster it's a human", "62:11", "driving Association a human driving", "62:14", "Association is what it is here pull it", "62:16", "pull it back up again so you can look at", "62:17", "it yeah the war on driving is here", "62:22", "a little paranoid there a little", "62:24", "paranoid but you got to remember Matt", "62:26", "Farah is an automotive journalist so his", "62:29", "livelihood depends on talking about cars", "62:31", "and he's a real legitimate car nut what", "62:35", "is this wrong answer", "62:36", "what is that pick the electric car oh", "62:38", "you clicked it oh I get it that's just a", "62:47", "joke but why would it be the wrong", "62:49", "answer it's just an an answer do you", "62:52", "drive", "62:53", "I do you do you drive an electric car a", "62:54", "regular car actually I don't have a car", "62:56", "don't know in Holland you don't run any", "62:58", "cars you just have a bike but it's", "63:01", "fucking freezing there yeah okay", "63:08", "hardcore listen I'm a big fan of Holland", "63:10", "because I kick box so alright you guys", "63:13", "have some of the greatest kick boxers of", "63:15", "all time yeah came from this one small", "63:16", "place yeah it's very unusual yeah you", "63:19", "know why is that I have no idea yeah we", "63:23", "just have to punch people I guess when", "63:26", "you they cut you off with the cars oh oh", "63:29", "but Hollin is a very unique place isn't", "63:32", "it I mean it's a it's a very unusual", "63:34", "country um I mean yeah sometimes we", "63:38", "wonder why do you think this the issue", "63:41", "camp is based on hollander okay my", "63:43", "department and for us it makes a lot of", "63:45", "sense in that we live below sea level so", "63:48", "we're like we have pre pre capital and", "63:51", "the highest number of hydraulic", "63:53", "engineers and maritime engineers so it's", "63:57", "it's just very good access to", "64:00", "human capital and yeah so so it really", "64:04", "makes sense for us to be there is a lot", "64:05", "of offshore engineering companies that", "64:07", "that support us and are involved with us", "64:11", "contractors so so for us it's not pretty", "64:15", "very strange but I don't know about the", "64:18", "other things there's it's got a lot of", "64:19", "innovation coming from such a small", "64:21", "country yeah a lot of innovation and", "64:23", "really unique intelligent people I've", "64:25", "met a lot of people from Holland and", "64:27", "they're just really fascinating people", "64:28", "wim hof do you know when yeah I've never", "64:31", "met him but fuck you know guys the best", "64:33", "is so lovely this is such an amazing", "64:35", "person every time you're around him you", "64:36", "like feel better like somebody like me", "64:38", "some coffee like whoo I know he's just", "64:40", "he's very contagious and I mean I have I", "64:44", "have quite a few friends from Holland", "64:45", "you can check your watch you gotta take", "64:47", "off soon right no it's so funny you okay", "64:49", "it's just I am fascinated how how", "64:54", "variable people are and how these", "64:57", "cultures like Holland sort of arise and", "65:00", "I just find so many people from Holland", "65:03", "to be I'm waiting to meet assholes from", "65:05", "Holland I'm sure you must have them but", "65:07", "they get fifth sure they do but the", "65:10", "people that I've met from hall and", "65:11", "they're friendly and happy it's it's a", "65:13", "very unusual place yeah yeah sure yeah I", "65:18", "mean I I kind of feel the same way about", "65:20", "the u.s. west coast as well", "65:22", "it's just yeah I mean I'd definitely be", "65:26", "able to live in a place like San", "65:28", "Francisco maybe just because of the yeah", "65:31", "the high the high percentage of", "65:33", "engineers and entrepreneurs that that", "65:36", "kind of makes me feel at home but no but", "65:39", "I mean us in general I feel like yeah", "65:42", "people are very friendly I could tell", "65:45", "you some some spots that suck ok there's", "65:47", "a few spots yeah you're in a good spot", "65:50", "right here and San Francisco is a", "65:51", "fantastic spot and for in terms of", "65:53", "innovation how well has it's been", "65:57", "received in in America and particularly", "66:00", "in California I mean obviously you're", "66:01", "here to do some business and talk to", "66:03", "some people yeah is this something that", "66:05", "people are very excited about and you", "66:06", "feel like there's a lot of momentum", "66:07", "behind it actually us is the", "66:10", "yeah the number one group of support is", "66:13", "for us because we know we fucked up a", "66:14", "lot with the ocean and it's right maybe", "66:16", "I mean that's but no just I think people", "66:22", "are very very supportive maybe it's also", "66:25", "because the geography of the patch it's", "66:27", "right between two US states yeah it's", "66:30", "like Canada but different so yeah so", "66:33", "it's yeah I think we receive a lot of", "66:37", "support from the US I think that yeah", "66:40", "our biggest support group is from here", "66:42", "and like everyone I talked to here they", "66:44", "they really want to get a vote so yeah I", "66:48", "I think the yeah we're kind of lucky", "66:52", "that it's next to the US I guess so", "66:54", "you've raised all this money is this", "66:55", "going to be a profitable business I", "66:58", "should wear it so we're an um for-profit", "67:00", "entity so we're not even allowed to make", "67:03", "profit but eventually yeah the idea is", "67:06", "that this sort of this plastic business", "67:08", "would be sort of a separate thing and", "67:11", "that would then create the funding for", "67:14", "the cleanup so everything would be", "67:16", "reinvested in the cleaner oh that's", "67:18", "fantastic so do you have a name for the", "67:20", "plastic business", "67:21", "ah no right now it's just under the", "67:24", "ocean cleanup still well we're actually", "67:26", "thinking about some kind of Brent name", "67:27", "but see you next year", "67:29", "yeah please let me know I mean we'll", "67:31", "promote the hell out of that I think", "67:32", "that's a fantastic idea and I'll try to", "67:34", "buy as many things out of plastic as", "67:36", "they can sell do I think yeah I mean", "67:39", "think the more things you can buy", "67:40", "maybe plasti sell get this guy you know", "67:43", "that phone where are you buddy yeah it", "67:45", "makes these he's this guy carves all", "67:49", "these himself and then makes these molds", "67:52", "and then hand paints all these well yeah", "67:55", "he's a little wizard yeah I don't know", "67:57", "he's a little just he's a wizard maybe", "67:59", "the big was a sexual sighs there's me", "68:02", "now I'm a little taller than art but my", "68:05", "head's not that big either but yeah", "68:07", "these things are I mean to have a line", "68:10", "made out completely out of ocean plastic", "68:12", "would be amazing maybe he'll do a Boyan", "68:14", "version that'd be creepy", "68:15", "I would have bad repeat could be looking", "68:18", "at me over there yeah yeah they could", "68:20", "face you yeah that's a weird face too", "68:23", "but yeah I mean there's there's really", "68:26", "the sky's limit in terms of applications", "68:28", "if your plastic and and again I just", "68:31", "think it'd be so attractive to people I", "68:33", "mean especially out here California at", "68:36", "least posing you know as being", "68:39", "environmentally conscious there's a lot", "68:41", "of environmentally conscious losers out", "68:42", "here for sure I mean they would like to", "68:44", "just be able to say that you know like", "68:47", "oh my dog's leashes may not have", "68:48", "environmentally conscious plastic that", "68:50", "we put from the ocean I was actually a", "68:52", "part of the expedition Isles there no", "68:54", "that's a good idea yeah I mean really", "68:57", "it's just I just think the sky's the", "68:59", "limit in terms of just the", "69:02", "attractiveness of that kind of plastic", "69:04", "ya know on one hand it's a problem that", "69:07", "everything is made out of plastic but it", "69:08", "does give a huge potential for", "69:11", "alternative materials like like there's", "69:13", "ocean paths yeah what do you feel you're", "69:16", "gonna be doing when this is done like", "69:18", "say if you get to this point where most", "69:19", "of the stuffs pulled out of the ocean", "69:21", "and what do you what do you plan for the", "69:23", "future you're 23 years old I mean you", "69:25", "can't really basically do anything you", "69:26", "want", "69:26", "sure um maybe going a holiday for once", "69:30", "and yeah and then I'll probably just be", "69:34", "working on the next one you know I think", "69:37", "I think this is what I love doing and", "69:41", "yeah I hope I'll get the opportunity to", "69:44", "work on many more problems like this in", "69:46", "the future so you feel like you will be", "69:48", "a problem-solver like that's your thing", "69:50", "that'd be I should put that on my", "69:52", "business card problem solver yeah why", "69:54", "not yeah I mean that's essentially what", "69:56", "you are right I yeah I think there's", "69:59", "just nothing more fun than sort of", "70:01", "solving the problem is and when you", "70:04", "think about project like the ocean", "70:05", "cleanup you're sure you're solving or", "70:07", "you're solving part of a massive problem", "70:10", "but just the whole road to it it's just", "70:13", "like one little problem after another", "70:15", "little problem and yeah I just you know", "70:19", "I think it's just very sort of", "70:21", "intellectual intellectually satisfying", "70:23", "to be sort of confronted with this", "70:26", "there's new weird problem and then you", "70:28", "can have to think how to solve them and", "70:30", "as you know as the CEO you're sort of", "70:32", "the accumulation zone the the Garbage", "70:36", "Patch", "70:37", "as it were for problems within your own", "70:39", "organization so everything that other", "70:41", "people cannot solve sort of end up with", "70:43", "with you yeah I kind of I kind like that", "70:48", "it's it's just fun thinking about things", "70:50", "so for example just this week we had", "70:53", "like I think it was Mercer last week so", "70:58", "on Monday was so we have this assembly", "71:00", "yard and there was a fence that was", "71:03", "seven meters too far to the left and", "71:06", "there was just this this email from from", "71:10", "the government saying oh if you don't", "71:11", "move it within ten days you have to stop", "71:13", "your operation and I go shit yeah I mean", "71:16", "it's a little problem and you just have", "71:18", "to do a few calls and think about well", "71:19", "how can we now arrange the assembly yard", "71:22", "in a way that it's still big enough so", "71:24", "we can assemble this two thousand feet", "71:25", "thing and then the next day turned out", "71:28", "there was a sort of a slight", "71:29", "misalignment of one of the connection", "71:32", "strips on one of the the floatation", "71:35", "elements of the system and you can have", "71:37", "to figure out how can we still attach it", "71:39", "well I'm sort of working with this and", "71:42", "you know they're sort of just details", "71:44", "but there are details on a daily basis", "71:45", "and yeah that kind of what makes it fun", "71:48", "for me if it would all go flawlessly it", "71:51", "would yeah be pretty boring well that's", "71:53", "what's fascinating about a guy like you", "71:54", "is that your personality perfectly", "71:57", "aligns with this kind of problem I mean", "72:00", "and that's a very unusual thing did you", "72:03", "do you a puzzle solver when you were a", "72:05", "kid were you into like mysteries like", "72:07", "what is um number there's just billion", "72:10", "so actually so one of the things that I", "72:12", "that funny anecdote is when it was I", "72:14", "think it was about 13 years old I had", "72:18", "this idea of doing getting into the", "72:22", "Guinness Book of Records with launching", "72:24", "model rockets so it's really into those", "72:26", "kind of things and I build them myself", "72:28", "and they shoot up like three and a feet", "72:30", "in the sky and what I didn't do I was", "72:34", "sort of organized this whole thing with", "72:37", "like there was media we had sponsors and", "72:39", "we at the University collaborating and", "72:42", "we just had this sports field with 300", "72:44", "people who would all at the same time", "72:46", "they would all launch the rocket and", "72:48", "actually I think we launched", "72:50", "213 of them at the same time and", "72:52", "actually gun the Guinness Book of", "72:54", "Records says I always have my projects", "72:56", "let's put it that way have you thought", "72:58", "about potentially working with companies", "73:03", "that produce environmental waste like", "73:05", "maybe a company brings you on as a", "73:08", "problem solver for some sort of an issue", "73:11", "that they have a residual issue of", "73:13", "something that they produce yeah I mean", "73:17",
