isn't right but that opens up", "12:42", "this whole exciting other set of", "12:43", "possibilities the the main reason why", "12:47", "people assume that people do drugs is to", "12:50", "escape reality what do you think is the", "12:53", "the primary thing that they're running", "12:55", "from so you've gotta separate out two", "12:57", "things and this surprised me because my", "12:58",

fact there's something wrong with", "14:53", "that story we've been told because when", "14:55", "it was explained to me by loads of", "14:57", "doctors in Britain where I'm from if you", "14:59",

I've", "132:21", "been saying the other stuff but", "132:22", "professor not argues well we know that", "132:26", "cannabis use has massively increased in", "132:28", "Britain for example I thinking like", "132:30", "20-fold increase since 1960 in Britain", "132:32", "and yet levels of schizophrenia have", "132:34", "remained the same if cannabis was", "132:35", "causing schizophrenia you would
