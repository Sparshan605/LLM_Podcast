they", "07:31", "have like Nikon has a deal with the Flat", "07:33", "Earth Society it's this this camera it's", "07:35", "just like it's not like a SLR or", "07:37", "anything it's just like a $600

it's got these four little moons", "08:39", "that are orbiting it then it looks like", "08:41", "just follow the lights in the line with", "08:43", "with Jupiter and they actually move", "08:45", "around in a regular pattern and they", "08:48", "move around they've got orbits of like", "08:49", "like some of them I think 80 hours or", "08:51", "something so they move around really", "08:52",

the same way that science", "09:08", "predicts us that they should move when", "09:10", "using Kepler's you know laws of", "09:12", "planetary motion linear Newton's using", "09:15", "this law of gravitation they will you", "09:18", "know that they move exactly as if they", "09:20", "are a little simulation of a planetary", "09:22", "system so either there's some kind of", "09:25", "weird

"what what when did you first become", "09:37", "aware of this but you run metal bunk for", "09:39", "a long time and for those who don't know", "09:41", "Mick and I met on the sci-fi show that I", "09:44", "did your Rogen questions everything", "09:45", "where we we discussed chemtrails or", "09:47", "contrails and what causes a jet engine", "09:50", "to make what looks like artificial",

"10:00", "spraying the government is spraying", "10:01", "something in the sky and you caught it", "10:04", "you you had a really good explanation", "10:06", "for it you said they're basically like", "10:07", "two training wheels for conspiracy", "10:09", "theories because yeah yes it's something", "10:13", "you can see yeah I think he's kind of", "10:15", "more enticing yes and I think the same", "10:17", "thing applies to the Flat Earth now yes", "10:19", "when I got into the Flat Earth thing it", "10:21", "was I became aware of it a few years ago", "10:24", "or so yeah so the government turned up", "10:28", "was it your camera yeah yeah sitting out", "10:33", "man Jeff McMahan spying yeah so like", "10:37", "when I first heard about the Flat Earth", "10:39", "theory obviously if I heard it before my", "10:40", "actually my father going back when I was", "10:43", "young he told me that he was a member of", "10:45", "the Flat Earth Society your father told", "10:47", "you yeah was he joking around kind of", "10:50", "but what he was doing it in a kind of", "10:52", "satirical way ironically he was doing it", "10:56", "because like he was like saying people", "10:57", "are too sure of themselves and so I'm", "11:00", "going to join the Flat Earth Society he", "11:01", "didn't believe the earth was round so", "11:04", "it's been around for quite a while the", "11:05", "Flat Earth Society yet the flash", "11:07", "theory has been around yeah obviously", "11:11", "like thousands of years ago people", "11:12", "thought the earth was round and then", "11:14", "slightly a few a thousand years ago", "11:16", "people figured out that it wasn't here", "11:17", "stick it out by the ancient Greeks like", "11:19", "three thousand years ago that it wasn't", "11:20", "and by the way it wasn't round it wasn't", "11:23", "there was a platter oh you fucked it up", "11:25", "you gave up the goose youyou said", "11:27", "thousands of years ago people thought", "11:29", "the earth was round and they realized it", "11:31", "wasn't yeah you just right now you gave", "11:33", "them fuel that's a quotas going to go", "11:35", "yeah but I am a seal quote yeah from the", "11:39", "last one yeah that's right that one a", "11:42", "slight misquote yeah so so yeah what", "11:46", "happened was science basically figured", "11:48", "out the shape of the universe and you", "11:51", "know in the 1800's there was like", "11:53", "gentlemen scientist doing all sorts of", "11:55", "all kinds of cool things with stars like", "11:57", "measuring the orbits and checking out", "11:59", "how far away things were in discovering", "12:01", "that there were galaxies and things like", "12:03", "that you know there's always science", "12:04", "going on but then there was this kind of", "12:06", "this guy comes along called Samuel", "12:09", "Rowbotham who published under the name", "12:11", "of parallax in about 1860 and he started", "12:16", "publishing what is basically the same as", "12:18", "Eric de Bey's book that has been", "12:20", "published now pretty much every single", "12:23", "thing that is in Eric de Bey's current", "12:26", "book you will find in Samuel Roberson's", "12:28", "book from 1860 and in fact if you read", "12:31", "debates book which I don't recommend you", "12:34", "will see that about 80% of the text at", "12:37", "Varick today's book is actually quotes", "12:39", "from these books from eighteen hundreds", "12:41", "it's not actually this new stuff that", "12:43", "he's discovered hmm it's all stuff like", "12:45", "you know if somebody walks away from you", "12:48", "you will see their feet disappear first", "12:49", "and then he has a two-page quote of", "12:52", "Samuel Rowbotham saying the exact same", "12:54", "thing from the 1860s so it's basically", "12:57", "recycling this this theory that started", "13:00", "in the 1860s and then just adding a few", "13:02", "little sprinkles to it like saying that", "13:04", "astronauts must be paid and the space", "13:07", "station is fake because that's a delay", "13:09", "terrific as well yeah Dube he's", "13:11", "hilarious he thinks the dinosaurs are", "13:12", "fake nuclear bombs are fake I mean", "13:15", "there's the idea that one person would", "13:19", "be this mastermind that discovers all", "13:20", "these monumental frauds yeah and he but", "13:24", "he I don't think he's claiming to have", "13:26", "discovered these things there's lots of", "13:27", "people who think that nuclear the nukes", "13:29", "are fake and dinosaurs being fake is an", "13:31", "obvious thing for creationists and", "13:33", "people of that that ilk but yeah he's", "13:37", "basically recycling theories in a way", "13:40", "that is popular to the reader and", "13:43", "figuring out how to get them across to", "13:44", "people so he right it is these YouTube", "13:46", "videos that are very engaging", "13:48", "yeah and they sound good yeah then this", "13:50", "B sounds if you don't know what's what", "13:52", "did they sound like they make sense", "13:54", "that's the problem and some of them are", "13:55", "quite technical right at least they use", "13:57", "a lot of technical terms right but", "14:00", "they're they delve into things like", "14:03", "there's there's a variety of experiments", "14:06", "the michelson-morley experiment that", "14:09", "Eddie mentioned is one of them that", "14:10", "keeps cropping up remembers which will", "14:13", "never been reproduced that's the", "14:15", "experiment that no it was actually has", "14:17", "been reproduced because it's well the", "14:19", "wrong way not the way that they wanted", "14:21", "the michelson-morley Mori the", "14:23", "michelson-morley experiment was an", "14:25", "experiment to detect the luminiferous", "14:27", "ether which is the supposed medium", "14:31", "through which light travels now back in", "14:34", "the 1800s we didn't know that light was", "14:36", "made up out of photons because light was", "14:38", "was waves so we thought that there was", "14:41", "this stuff that permeated all of space", "14:42", "called the luminous lumen lumen if Aris", "14:45", "ether luminiferous ether it's a little", "14:48", "hard to pronounce and that this is what", "14:51", "light travel through as waves going", "14:52", "through and like didn't know exactly how", "14:54", "it works but the the figure there must", "14:56", "be this stuff that permeates all of", "14:58", "space and then they figure that since", "15:00", "the earth was moving and these", "15:01", "scientists actually knew at the time", "15:02", "that the earth was moving so they were", "15:04", "using this as a basis for their", "15:05", "experiment this other if the earth is", "15:07", "moving then they will be able to detect", "15:10", "the ether by doing this experiment so", "15:13", "what they did they said it was", "15:14", "experiment with a shot like one", "15:15", "direction and the other direction then", "15:17", "when it came back together it combined", "15:19", "and if they were moving through the", "15:21", "ether or if the ether was moving through", "15:23", "them then the light that went one way", "15:26", "would interfere with the with the light", "15:28", "that went the other way so that was the", "15:29", "whole experiment was just just this", "15:31", "thing they shot these two light beams in", "15:33", "two directions", "15:34", "they figured like you know we turn the", "15:36", "table this way it will change because", "15:37", "we're now going through the ether in", "15:38", "different direction but what happened", "15:40", "was nothing was detected which was kind", "15:43", "of the start of people realizing oh", "15:45", "there is no luminiferous ether right Oba", "15:47", "you used that to say that it's because", "15:50", "the earth isn't moving that was what the", "15:52", "flatter an animal tried to get yeah they", "15:54", "did they did but Michelson and Morley", "15:57", "knew the earth was moving right they", "15:59", "wanted to figure out whether the ether", "16:02", "was moving with the earth or whether the", "16:05", "earth was moving through the ether right", "16:07", "they were trying to detect the ether so", "16:09", "people who thought that the earth was", "16:11", "the center of the universe not really so", "16:13", "much fell flat earthers people who were", "16:15", "geo centrists people who thought that", "16:17", "the sun went around the earth and the", "16:19", "whole all the stars went around the", "16:21", "earth there's still people like that", "16:22", "Valley where I am yeah the recent", "16:24", "resurgence some of the thing was Gavin", "16:28", "McInnes sent me something or some guy", "16:30", "thinks at the earth is the center of the", "16:31", "universe essentially he was saying that", "16:33", "it sort of confirms everything in", "16:35", "genesis like what yeah well I mean if", "16:39",

go", "35:20", "outside and you look to see is this what", "35:23", "I'm seeing on the screen here so this is", "35:27", "basically you checking the ground troops", "35:28", "of this program which seems like you", "35:30", "know very straightforward thing but then", "35:31", "what you can do from", "35:33", "that is you can then use the program to", "35:35", "look at the sky from other

looking into this thing that's", "36:45", "not real when the real space but the", "36:50", "actual like what is observable about", "36:52", "space is so mind-blowing", "36:56", "yeah and somehow or

yeah that's the real stuff that's", "38:08", "really crazy earth idea so it's like", "38:10", "this tiny little thing all the earth is", "38:11", "glass and we're stuck in this weird", "38:13",

"38:29", "they think that if they can convince you", "38:31", "that the world is flat when it isn't", "38:32", "then it's kind of like in 1984 where", "38:36", "they get people to believe that two

and it's a way", "38:48", "of mind-control so the same thing would", "38:51", "happen with the Flat Earth but on a far", "38:53", "grander scale you're not just convincing", "38:54", "someone that two plus two equals five", "38:56", "and war equals peace etc etc you're", "38:59", "convincing them that the earth is flat", "39:00", "where it's actually around so by doing", "39:03", "by twisting their minds around something", "39:05", "that's demonstrably false I'm making the", "39:08", "thing that it's correct then you're", "39:10", "gaining power over their mind in the", "39:12", "same way that

it just sounds all very", "40:11", "reasonable at the starts really I'll", "40:13", "tell the beginning more and more like", "40:16", "the third that you get into it but also", "40:17", "the reverse

"41:48", "feed them all this nonsense was very", "41:49", "articulately and very smooth the way", "41:51", "talks and makes us well and did videos", "41:54", "and a very compelling and because he's", "41:55", "not an authority he's not like you know", "41:57", "part of the government he's rather the", "42:00", "the the alt culture hmm they tend to", "42:04", "give his arguments way more weight than", "42:07", "mainstream science yeah yeah and then", "42:10", "they'll find out something like that New", "42:12", "York Times article that was out", "42:14", "a couple months backward showed that", "42:15", "scientists from the 1950s were paid off", "42:17", "by sugar companies to switch the blame", "42:20", "to saturated fat and he started", "42:22", "attributing all these health

unhealthy for you and they", "42:39", "did it because they thought that they", "42:40", "were you know following science and so", "42:43", "questioning science and questioning", "42:45", "scientists you know occasionally you're", "42:48", "right occasionally you'll find something", "42:50", "like this yeah this conspiracy by the", "42:52", "sugar industry is the old saying like", "42:54", "trust yet verify yes you know a Reagan", "42:57", "popularized that with the salt talks I", "42:59", "think yes that's a very good statement", "43:01", "trust yep just verify and yeah yeah", "43:03", "that's if you want to trust out dabei", "43:05", "that's fine but let's check check the", "43:07", "things that he says yeah I checked one", "43:09", "of his things on the way here on the", "43:10", "plane he has the thing that a lot of", "43:13", "them say which is that the horizon", "43:15", "always rises to eye level so on the", "43:18", "plane on the way here I check to see if", "43:20", "this is actually correct now most people", "43:21", "when they check to see if the horizon", "43:23", "rises to eye level they just look out", "43:24", "the window and say oh yeah there's the", "43:27", "horizon over there eye level the on a", "43:30", "rounder the horizon is actually going", "43:32", "down a little bit when you look at the", "43:33", "window of a plane because you're thirty", "43:35", "thousand feet up in the air it actually", "43:36", "drops around two or three degrees mm-hmm", "43:38", "but it's very hard to see when you're", "43:40", "looking at out of the wing of the plane", "43:41", "so it's very easy to get taken into", "43:43", "believing that it's dated eye level so", "43:46", "what I did is I took this little", "43:48", "carpenter's level brought a carpenter's", "43:51", "the government is level very small one", "43:52", "it's only like there's like eight inches", "43:53", "long as though and I've taped a small", "43:56", "tube to the top which is like a bit of a", "43:57", "pen and then I said it level and wedged", "44:00", "it so it was level and then I looked", "44:02", "through the tube on the top of this", "44:04", "level and saw where the horizon was and", "44:06", "the horizon was just below the end of", "44:09", "the level", "44:10", "so the horizon is actually dropped away", "44:13", "which meant the debates claim about the", "44:16", "horizon rising to a level which is", "44:17", "something you'd expect on a flat earth", "44:18", "was actually incorrect and it's", "44:20", "demonstrably incorrect with this a two", "44:22", "dollar level which actually got free", "44:24", "from somewhere and anyone can do this", "44:25", "you don't even need to", "44:28", "being a plane in fact it works better if", "44:30", "you just like it a cliff or something", "44:31", "like a thousand stayed up well that's", "44:34", "another claim that people keep saying", "44:35", "that are devotees of this Flat Earth", "44:38", "idea that that if you get on a plane and", "44:40", "you look up and you look out the window", "44:42", "it looks flat but I do not think that", "44:45", "people understand perspective and they", "44:47", "do not understand how huge the earth is", "44:50", "when you see there's images someone did", "44:52", "an image that showed how far you are up", "44:55", "when you're thirty thousand feet in the", "44:57", "air and then how how like huge the earth", "45:01", "actually is and you get this like little", "45:03", "image of a plane at 30,000 feet and then", "45:06", "the dot of the plane is represented in", "45:09", "the amount of distance between the earth", "45:11", "is in perspective and then you see how", "45:13", "enormous the planet is and it's just", "45:16", "you're dealing with something that's so", "45:18", "big it's all I mean it feels like it's", "45:22", "flat it feels like it's flat because", "45:24", "it's enormous in your tiny yeah that's", "45:27", "that's a huge issue with people is that", "45:29", "they don't really understand the scale", "45:30", "of the planet and they don't understand", "45:33", "how little it actually curves yeah", "45:35", "there's there's a road if you look if", "45:38", "you look up like the longest roads in", "45:41", "America along a straight road in America", "45:42", "does this road is in like Oklahoma or", "45:44", "somewhere and it's about 80 miles long", "45:47", "it's just perfectly straight it actually", "45:50", "isn't perfectly straight because when", "45:51", "you laid it out it laid it out along a", "45:53", "line of latitude so if one of the lines", "45:55", "that goes around around the earth so", "45:58", "it's actually slightly curved but when", "46:00", "you look at it it looks perfectly", "46:02", "straight you have to actually like you", "46:04", "know take the whole image and then draw", "46:06", "a line from one end to the other in", "46:08", "Google Earth and you see that it", "46:09", "deviates by just this tiny little amount", "46:11", "but if you were to drive along this road", "46:13", "you're actually driving you know around", "46:15", "you're actually turning right slightly", "46:18", "the whole time but it looks perfectly", "46:19", "straight because it's hardly moving at", "46:21", "all though with this 80 miles it moves", "46:23", "maybe like 10 feet or something and", "46:25", "people just don't don't don't realize", "46:29", "just how small the curve of the earth", "46:32", "actually is it looks flat and again", "46:34", "again I think a real big problem with", "46:37", "this theory and with a lot of these", "46:38", "theories a lot of these really", "46:40", "outlandish", "46:41", "Spira see theories is once they hook you", "46:43", "it's very difficult to unhook yourself", "46:45", "you you don't want to believe that you", "46:48", "got taken you don't want to believe", "46:49", "you've been had you don't wanna believe", "46:50", "been fooled so you keep going deeper and", "46:53", "deeper down the rabbit hole and you keep", "46:54", "finding more and more confirmation bias", "46:57", "more people inside that walled garden as", "46:59", "you put it and some people actually go", "47:02", "out and do scientific experiments and", "47:04", "they try reasonably hard some of them", "47:07", "but then they make some kind of mistake", "47:09", "and then they they say this is actual", "47:11", "proof that the earth is flat like those", "47:13", "the level experiment that I did someone", "47:15", "did something similar with that they", "47:17", "said they use like a water level where", "47:18", "you have two tubes connected and use the", "47:20", "level of the water cause the waters", "47:22", "levels the same on both of them and then", "47:25", "they hold this up and see if it was", "47:26", "below the horizon but they did this", "47:28", "experiment and they did it at sea level", "47:29", "which meant is all's going to be exactly", "47:32", "the same as the horizon you've actually", "47:33", "got to go up a thousand feet before you", "47:34", "can see anything but they still you know", "47:36", "even even though they they thought that", "47:40", "they were doing some science but they", "47:42", "make this one key mistake and then they", "47:44", "won't listen to anybody trying to tell", "47:45", "them what the mistake actually was", "47:47", "people are a ridiculous amount of people", "47:51", "doing Flat Earth experiments on YouTube", "47:54", "and just getting it completely wrong I", "47:57", "think the most common one is people", "47:59", "taking photographs or something that", "48:00", "they think shouldn't be visible from a", "48:03", "certain position they don't say like", "48:05", "here's uh you know Catalina Island and", "48:08", "it's like 60 miles away and according to", "48:11", "the curvature of the earth that means it", "48:13", "should be been up below five miles of", "48:15", "curve and so it shouldn't be visible and", "48:18", "then there's all these mistakes that", "48:20", "they make some of them are like they do", "48:21", "the math wrong some of them like they", "48:22", "they don't account for the fact that", "48:24", "you've got a you know factor in how high", "48:28", "the viewer is or some of them will just", "48:30", "they'll get entirely the wrong Island", "48:32", "slides will say like oh this is his", "48:34", "Island which is like 100 miles away and", "48:35", "right looking something that's 40 miles", "48:37", "away well how come you can look out in", "48:38", "the I mean here's a simple one how can", "48:40", "you look out across the ocean you're not", "48:42", "seeing anything on the other side yeah", "48:44", "like what's over there well so far away", "48:46", "you can't see it they got an out there", "48:47", "they're going out though because the you", "48:50", "wouldn't go see anything away because of", "48:51", "the

yeah depending on the angle", "59:28", "that's a claim that the chemtrails put", "59:31", "out sometimes with the planes don't have", "59:33", "windows which is generally that", "59:35", "generally

this", "59:49", "sunny coming up in August which is the", "59:51", "eclipse there's going to be a total", "59:54", "eclipse of the Sun over North America", "59:56", "I think August 21st this year I think", "59:59", "that would be a great opportunity for", "60:00", "people to encourage anybody who believes", "60:03", "in the Flat Earth to actually start", "60:05", "looking at the what's going on

things the", "60:18", "excuse well not the excuse the reason", "60:21", "we're giving them is that there's an", "60:22", "eclipse and everybody wants a look at", "60:24", "their clothes it's an amazing thing the", "60:25", "moon goes in front of the Sun and blocks", "60:26", "it out yeah but I think that you're", "60:28", "giving them too much credit I think also", "60:29", "want us to do is make a youtube video", "60:31", "with some wonky explanation for why an", "60:33", "eclipse works and then it works because", "60:34", "the earth is a disk and the Sun gets", "60:36", "below the disk and it blocks it out from", "60:38", "below I mean it just doesn't seem to me", "60:40", "that it's it's enough this is a solar", "60:42", "eclipse though they understand they can", "60:44", "tell if the moon is going in front of", "60:46", "the Sun well I know I know what you're", "60:48", "saying is logical but no even the flight", "60:50", "others believe that the moon goes in", "60:52", "front of the Sun for a solar eclipse", "60:53", "others yeah because they can you can", "60:55", "track the position of the moving through", "60:56", "the sky and they know that you know it", "60:58", "gets closer to the Sun every every time", "61:00", "don't you believe that like the earth", "61:01", "sits flat and then everything spins", "61:03", "around the earth they know well yeah", "61:05", "they you know the earth is flat and the", "61:06", "the Sun Sun and Moon are like orbiting", "61:10", "above like this but you know sometimes", "61:13", "the the moon is going to be below the", "61:15", "Sun and it blocks out the light of the", "61:17", "Sun and that's how an eclipse happens on", "61:19", "the flat earth and on the rounder hmm so", "61:22", "it would be an amazing thing to see even", "61:25", "if you're a flat earth believer this", "61:27", "this very rare coincidence when the the", "61:30", "moon is in front of the Sun so usually", "61:31", "encourage people who are flat earth", "61:33", "believers to look at this amazing thing", "61:35", "that's happening they still didn't give", "61:38", "a fuck is there is there uniformity in", "61:40", "the Flat Earth community and they like", "61:42", "or greed or is there like dissension", "61:44", "there's some people say you know that", "61:47", "it's because they're the ice wall no", "61:48", "there's no fucking ice wall just to drop", "61:50", "off and this everybody dies there is", "61:52", "kind of like you know this mainstream", "61:53", "thing where you know the debate model of", "61:55", "things it's kind of like in the", "61:57", "chemtrail community you know you've got", "61:59", "this one guy", "62:00", "Dane Wigington who is really popular guy", "62:03", "and then you've got like a bunch of", "62:04", "other thing which one is he is he the", "62:05", "guy that made that uh the videos now", "62:07", "that was no Michael J Murphy was yeah", "62:09", "dark I was he was a little loony and", "62:14", "Whittington is the guy who lives in a", "62:17", "big house on 200 acres up in the", "62:19", "mountains somewhere and he got obsessed", "62:22", "with solar panels being blocked by", "62:24", "contrails and so became a Kentrell", "62:25", "believer but he's like the equivalent of", "62:27", "debate because he's the guy who's really", "62:29", "promoting it but then there's other", "62:31", "people in the the chemtrail community", "62:33", "who are doing their own thing and they", "62:36", "say this weekend guys full of crap", "62:38", "because it believes in global warming", "62:39",

"62:48", "to stop global warming and other people", "62:50", "think that chemtrails are causing global", "62:53", "warming and then there's other people", "62:54", "who think that chemtrails are something", "62:56", "completely different", "62:56", "spreading nano robots to control", "62:59", "people's minds and things like that so", "63:00", "you got the same type of range of things", "63:02", "in the Flat Earth believers as well like", "63:05", "you some people think that the earth is", "63:07", "kind of concave it's not actually flat", "63:10", "at all what about the Hollow Earth", "63:11", "people so you hadn't the earth is hollow", "63:13", "that's that's not even that's not really", "63:15", "a flat earth thing that's like a round", "63:16", "earth with the hole in the track in a", "63:18", "new world in there people live on the", "63:20", "inside of the earth", "63:22", "which makes apps even less sense than", "63:26", "the Flat Earth from a physical point of",

"nuclear bombs people think that yeah", "64:03", "haven't heard that one is a fringe one", "64:05", "but it's you know there's got a few", "64:07", "people who believe it then there's", "64:08",

that but it will be detected ly", "70:31", "different seems like each each", "70:33", "simulation is going to be lower fidelity", "70:36", "than the universe that created it right", "70:40", "so you

up that you would that we", "71:12", "would have some sort of quantum", "71:14", "computing some astronomically powerful", "71:17", "devices that could render and create an", "71:21", "artificial

computers yeah emulating", "71:31", "yourself so I think you could I think", "71:32", "that would that's kind of a paradox", "71:34", "really it has as powerful as the thing", "71:36", "that is simulating it I don't think so I", "71:39", "think artificial intelligence is going", "71:40", "to lead us to well if you can create", "71:43", "something that's artificially", "71:45", "intelligent right which we feel like is", "71:47", "going to happen way quicker than 5,000", "71:49", "years from now if you create something", "71:50", "that's artificially intelligent it's", "71:51", "going to improve upon its design almost", "71:54", "instantaneously it's going to realize", "71:56", "like if you give it autonomy yeah we", "71:58", "don't know what's going to happen right", "71:59", "quantum computers we don't know how well", "72:01", "they're going to work they could break", "72:02", "like to be a dud cause well today or", "72:04", "it'll be fucking amazing could be", "72:06", "fucking amazing yeah who knows yeah it's", "72:08", "it's something to think about but when", "72:09", "when scientists start thinking that we", "72:12", "are currently living in some sort of a",

because it seems to me within the", "72:25", "realm of future possibility yeah it's", "72:27", "kind of like here's a thought experiment", "72:30", "because like if we are in a simulation", "72:31", "we we're not going to figure it out", "72:33", "right when we're not going to have to do", "72:34", "anything about it if we do figure it out", "72:36", "right right right yeah it's odd", "72:37",

"72:52", "but that's just basically as resolving", "72:56", "the laws of physics more yeah if we get", "72:58", "down that deep what can we we can't do", "72:59", "anything about it well not only that", "73:01", "does that actually mean that", "73:03", "we are living in some sort of an", "73:04", "artificial realm or does it mean that", "73:05", "that's what the universe is made of it's", "73:07", "not artificial but that the universe", "73:10", "much like what we're creating like that", "73:12", "the universe is almost fractal and much", "73:15", "like what we're creating when we're", "73:16", "creating these artificial environments", "73:17", "that the universe itself is made out of", "73:19", "ones and zeros and that this whole thing", "73:21", "is really mathematical yeah and that", "73:23", "just because we haven't been able to", "73:25", "detect it up until now doesn't mean it", "73:26", "hasn't been running on some sort of uh", "73:28", "some sort of a uber complicated", "73:31", "mathematical principle yeah I think it's", "73:33", "kind of a moot point in a way because", "73:35", "like what's important is what are the", "73:37", "laws of physics and you know can we can", "73:41", "we detect what's actually running the", "73:42", "laws of physics yeah so yeah it's it's a", "73:46", "philosophical question a little bit of", "73:48", "metal masturbating yeah it seems to me", "73:51", "that that's a thing that people do and I", "73:53", "think we could bring it back to this", "73:55", "Flat Earth thing is that people love to", "73:57", "go down these

field", "74:40", "happy family great friends great hobbies", "74:43", "loves is light and then it just becomes", "74:44", "a UFO nut doesn't seem to be the case", "74:46", "you still you got these pool players who", "74:48", "please I'm not doing so it's hard out", "74:51", "there for a pool player right none of", "74:52", "the guys at the top of the game is", "74:53", "there's a thing I think those guys just", "74:55", "watched too many fucking YouTube videos", "74:57", "and they don't have any science most", "74:59", "pool players one of the things about", "75:00", "what's that common

play pool really well and", "75:10", "you're not going to be doing that while", "75:11", "you're you know got your nose buried in", "75:14", "physics books I think like people like", "75:16", "like this like they get things out of", "75:18", "them they're getting something out of it", "75:20", "is giving them purpose in their life", "75:22", "it's like you know it's kind of like a", "75:23", "hobby in a way like you're just doing", "75:24", "something because you enjoy doing it", "75:26", "like playing chess yeah except along", "75:28", "with that hobby of doing stuff they", "75:29", "actually have a belief there's required", "75:32", "for them to actually do their hobby and", "75:34", "they don't obviously think of it like", "75:36", "that but they're essentially what it is", "75:38", "they have this activity they like doing", "75:40", "like gardening or whatever mm-hmm pretty", "75:42", "requires them to believe that the earth", "75:43", "is flat so they spend all the time like", "75:47", "making YouTube videos about how the", "75:49", "earth is flat or doing their experiments", "75:51", "about how the earth is flat and they're", "75:54", "getting something out of it because it's", "75:55", "their little hobby yeah I do the same", "75:57", "thing except I'm actually doing it for", "76:01", "science like I do these fun little", "76:03", "experiments like on the plane today I", "76:05", "was on the plane like wedged up against", "76:07", "the window looking through this holding", "76:09", "my camera up against it and the woman", "76:11", "next to him so that I was this crazy guy", "76:13", "you should told I think I learned that", "76:15", "the earth isn't flat ma'am she probably", "76:17", "thought that I was thinking the earth", "76:19", "was flat I've seen other people on", "76:21", "YouTube they're bringing levels on the", "76:22", "plane and they're like hey look the", "76:24", "level isn't moving well if you work all", "76:26", "day and you have an eight-hour day plus", "76:29", "commute plus family plus whatever bills", "76:31", "and issues that you have to deal with", "76:33", "and then you get into one of these", "76:35", "YouTube videos you simply problem you", "76:37", "simply don't have the time to really", "76:39", "explore all of the possibilities and all", "76:43", "the science behind all the arguments and", "76:45", "it's just yeah I think what happens is", "76:48", "either they you know they get this", "76:50", "superficial understanding of the", "76:52", "conspiracy theory yeah or the actual", "76:55", "real-life suffers mm-hmm a lot of people", "76:58", "get sucked into consideration if there", "77:00", "is like like chemtrails or 9/11 truth", "77:03", "and they become socially isolated yeah", "77:06", "so and they become they they get", "77:08", "divorced and they lose custody of their", "77:09", "children", "77:10", "happens all the time yeah and this this", "77:12", "isn't like you know it's not like the", "77:13", "government punishing them or anything", "77:15", "like that it's just because they become", "77:16", "obsessed with something that is outside", "77:18", "of societal norms and they feel a dis", "77:21", "overwhelming compelling need to tell", "77:24", "other people about it yeah and they they", "77:27", "say talk about oh yeah people roll their", "77:28", "eyes when I spring up", "77:30", "objective controls or the Flat Earth and", "77:32", "of course they do it yeah", "77:33", "but from their point of view they're", "77:35", "trying to wake up other people they're", "77:37", "doing they're doing like the Lord's work", "77:39", "by giving the truth to people but then", "77:42", "there's some theories that are really", "77:44", "compelling like when you look into", "77:46", "Operation Northwoods and you find out", "77:48", "that the government really was planning", "77:50", "false flag attacks it didn't work that's", "77:52", "exaggerated I know it's not at the", "77:54", "college exaggeration well there it was a", "77:56", "discussion document of course designed", "77:58", "by the Joint Chiefs of Staff yeah it's", "78:01", "it was rejected by anything like any", "78:04", "yeah it was designed by the different", "78:05", "she didn't get very far it was just one", "78:07", "document right they signed it they got", "78:10", "it they didn't sign you that they wanted", "78:12", "to do it but it was an idea the idea", "78:14", "that you were going to attack American", "78:16", "civilians that you were going to armed", "78:17", "Cuban friendlies an attack Guantanamo", "78:19", "Bay you're going to blow up a drone", "78:20", "airliner these were all proposed things", "78:22", "they were proposed things yeah but it", "78:24", "was just like you know white but you can", "78:25", "notice them I understand what you're", "78:27", "saying but spitballing that you're going", "78:28", "to deceive the American people and kill", "78:30", "American civilians and this is a normal", "78:32", "part of the way Nero burnt Rome Hitler", "78:34", "bone burned the Reichstag that false", "78:36", "flag attacks are real and they have", "78:39", "happened throughout history so when you", "78:41", "do have an open mind and you are", "78:42", "compelled to try to seek the truth you", "78:45", "got to be aware that these things have", "78:47", "happened in history they are real and if", "78:50", "you dismiss everything you'll be thought", "78:52", "of as a shill as much as I mean as much", "78:55", "as people who look for conspiracies and", "78:57", "everything they're also people who try", "78:58", "to dismiss everything and you have to be", "79:00", "very careful because there are a lot of", "79:02", "things that people do conspire to do", "79:04", "like one of the things that I brought up", "79:06", "a forum people hate when I talk about", "79:07", "this but I'm gonna do it again people", "79:09", "say I don't believe in conspiracy", "79:11", "conspiracies all right so you don't", "79:13", "believe in any conspiracy no okay do you", "79:15", "believe in 9/11 happened do you believe", "79:18", "that people flew planes into jet the", "79:21", "blue jet planes in the building's well", "79:23", "then you believe in conspiracies because", "79:25", "someone conspire to do that and they did", "79:27", "it they pulled it off a bunch of people", "79:29", "got together decide they're going to", "79:30", "attack they flew a plane into the", "79:33", "Pentagon they flew two planes into the", "79:35", "World Trade Center towers I mean that", "79:37", "really happened so that's a conspiracy", "79:39", "and they pulled it off so when you deep", "79:43", "bomb", "79:43", "all these things that are absolutely", "79:45", "false like Flat Earth and chemtrails and", "79:48", "UFOs and all that jazz you got to be", "79:51", "careful and not try to debunk everything", "79:52", "because now people you know anything I", "79:54", "just think like I personally just feel", "79:56", "the Northwoods thing is a bit overblown", "79:57", "I don't think it is at all what it was I", "79:59", "think it speaks volumes about what the", "80:00", "mindset of the Joint Chiefs of Staff", "80:02", "were is war it's one example and it", "80:04", "could one know yeah but it didn't come", "80:06", "up with any others", "80:08", "what about what got us in the Vietnam go", "80:11", "for Tonkin yeah how's the false flag", "80:12", "well that's debatable too because that", "80:14", "was just basically they thought that", "80:16", "they were

in", "85:07", "space yeah and this is like from the 70s", "85:09", "yeah pretty amazing by the space station", "85:13", "the International Space Station it flies", "85:14", "over at regular intervals and this is", "85:16", "like one of the ground truth things that", "85:18", "I was talking about earlier you can see", "85:20", "it you can look up when it's going to", "85:21", "fly over you can get

live is a little four and", "85:38", "you can get to send you an email and get", "85:40", "your camera out and take photographs of", "85:42", "it when it when it happens so you know", "85:45", "that this website is correct and you've", "85:46", "proven it on the ground and you can also", "85:48", "like do it from different positions and", "85:50", "get to people doing it and you can", "85:52",

i", "87:20", "doing yeah it's obvious like yeah one of", "87:23", "the most stupidly obvious proofs that", "87:26", "were not on the Flat Earth is that if", "87:28", "you get three people yes then one of", "87:30", "them at the bottom of South Africa one", "87:32", "of them at the bottom of South America", "87:34", "one of them in Australia and have them", "87:36", "all look South from that position now on", "87:40", "the Flat Earth you got one person here", "87:42", "one person here one person here and if", "87:43", "you look south like away from the North", "87:45", "Pole they're all looking in completely", "87:47", "different directions but in the real", "87:50", "world what do they actually see they all", "87:52", "see the exact same constellation the", "87:53", "Southern Cross right in front of them so", "87:56", "they're all looking in different", "87:58", "directions on the Flat Earth but on the", "88:00", "round earth they're all just looking", "88:01", "towards the Southern Cross so I assume", "88:05", "what you're saying it's literally", "88:06", "impossible to do that on the Flat Earth", "88:08", "right and you can actually see this and", "88:10", "take photographs installations and", "88:12", "compare yeah and that's something I was", "88:14", "talking about with the ground truth", "88:16", "thing with stellarium like you can you", "88:18", "could go virtually yourself to these", "88:20", "places and see what the sky looks from", "88:22", "that position", "88:24", "so either stellarium is lying or these", "88:27", "near the Southern Cross does actually", "88:28", "appear from these three different", "88:31", "positions well that's another thing that", "88:32", "these flat earth people keep bringing up", "88:34", "is Polaris the idea that this one", "88:36", "our exploits a great one and that all", "88:38", "these other stars rotate around it and", "88:40", "that this is somehow another proof that", "88:41", "the Earth's not spinning would that", "88:43", "we're on a flat earth what's so stupid", "88:45", "about that is that people in Australia", "88:46", "have a completely different", "88:47", "constellations back in the stars rotate", "88:49", "the the other direction around and the", "88:51", "stars are all coming towards us from the", "88:53", "east so if you look north the going that", "88:56", "way it looks out for the going that way", "88:57", "so the rotating around the North Star", "89:00", "which actually isn't anything special", "89:02", "it's just the stuff that happens to be", "89:04", "closest to the point the North point and", "89:07", "it changes all the time if you zoom in", "89:08", "you can actually see there are stars", "89:09", "that are even closer if you take a", "89:12", "time-lapse of a North Star it actually", "89:14", "makes a little circle well and also that", "89:16", "North Stars not the same North Star as", "89:18", "in the past yeah because the axis of the", "89:20", "earth so there's a single precession", "89:22", "where the every 26,000 years and wobbles", "89:25", "yeah was away yeah the air the south to", "89:28", "South everyone's looking at the same", "89:29", "thing in the south and the stars are", "89:31", "rotating in that direction but yet", "89:33", "Polaris Plus is a good one for a number", "89:35", "of reasons one is not really fixed it's", "89:37", "a it's a you know one degree off from", "89:40", "the center of the celestial sphere but", "89:43", "if you look at a time-lapse photograph", "89:44", "of the earth they point the camera up", "89:46", "like say from North America what you get", "89:49", "is the illusion that all these stars are", "89:51", "spinning around that one star is fixed", "89:53", "but it's because you're looking at a", "89:55", "time-lapse of only a few hours where", "89:57", "it's dark out at night whereas this", "89:58", "precession of the equinoxes is a very", "90:00", "slow process that takes 26,000 years and", "90:03", "you're just not going to get a 26,000", "90:05", "years of time lapse photo there you", "90:07", "could simulate it", "90:08", "yeah it could simulate valerio and you", "90:11", "know it's going to believe that what's", "90:12", "interesting is that some cultures it's", "90:14", "been pretty much observed that some", "90:16", "cultures were aware of the precession of", "90:18", "the equinoxes thousands of years ago", "90:19", "somehow that they kind of knew you know", "90:22", "quite impressive well a lot of old", "90:24", "cultures did actually take records of", "90:27", "the stars because stars we use for", "90:29", "navigation yeah the pole star you know", "90:31", "this Lee is is something that gives you", "90:35", "this fixed North", "90:37", "degree but the other stars as well like", "90:39", "if you know you know what how long it", "90:41", "takes to go from one place to another", "90:42", "you don't really understand the exact", "90:44", "maths but you can use it for navigation", "90:47", "go celestial navigation what are the", "90:49", "ridiculous things", "90:50", "can we point out before we wrap this up", "90:53", "my head starting to hurt", "90:54", "I had food poisoning yesterday folks I", "90:57", "know what happened I hate talked about", "90:58", "it a greasy diner", "90:59", "well Polaris's and a good thing because", "91:03", "you can actually look at the angle of", "91:04", "Polaris was out of banging to hear", "91:07", "banging I heard banging yeah I'll go", "91:16", "check oh it's next door he is putting", "91:20", "something on the walls act like they", "91:23", "shut down the stream twice on us already", "91:24", "oh really yeah it's flat earth I'm", "91:26", "recording hold things we got damnit um", "91:31", "what are the things ridiculous the", "91:33", "similar pleasures is wonder why they", "91:35", "satisfy arisen sucked off into space", "91:38", "well how about the one where that's a", "91:40", "good one but it's a good one because", "91:42", "like I've winded up myself I know now", "91:45", "why why that is I know why it's such a", "91:48", "in space why you're sucking today", "91:49", "because you think you think that a", "91:51", "vacuum sucks things right it's going to", "91:53", "like suck everything it sucks everything", "91:55", "away so if this is atmosphere on the", "91:57", "earth the the vacuum of space will suck", "91:59", "it away but the thing is like vacuum", "92:01", "doesn't actually suck vacuum is nothing", "92:03", "it has no energy it doesn't know", "92:04", "anything there's no power the reason", "92:06", "that things flow into vacuum is air", "92:08", "pressure and air pressure is a function", "92:10", "of gravity so gravity is pulling", "92:14", "everything down towards the earth so", "92:17", "there's no there's no nothing that can", "92:19", "push it out", "92:21", "hmmm if you say that see what I'm saying", "92:23", "okay if you imagine like if the universe", "92:25", "was suddenly filled with loads and loads", "92:26", "of gas like oxygen sigh then you stick a", "92:29", "big planet in all the gas we kind of", "92:33", "like gravity would bring it down towards", "92:35", "this planet", "92:36", "well they don't believe in gravity yeah", "92:37", "they don't gravity electromagnetic this", "92:40", "is my favorite new one did you see the", "92:42", "front one where they show that if the", "92:44", "earth was a globe but all the water be", "92:46", "on the bottom", "92:46", "yeah I wonder wonderful I think that was", "92:48", "a joke you think it's a joke how can I", "92:51", "be so sure about the other ones as well", "92:53", "but no no bring it up Jamie", "92:55", "this one's wonderful I think they're", "92:57", "being serious yeah the gravity thing", "92:59", "though it's kind of like almost", "93:02", "irrelevant", "93:03", "because yeah you know we know that", "93:05", "things fall down right but it's", "93:07", "electromagnetic something-or-other well", "93:09", "it's a magical force that's making", "93:11", "things fall down it doesn't really", "93:12", "matter you know gravity we could say we", "93:14", "don't really understand what guy how do", "93:15", "you explain lava lava is a part of", "93:17", "gravity too right", "93:18", "lava well it's the idea that all these", "93:21", "rocks are pushing down there's exception", "93:23", "and heat buoyancy buoyancy and density", "93:26", "you can see in density there are", "93:27", "functions of gravity learn if you stick", "93:29", "something in the water is and all the", "93:32", "water is flowing to the bottom this", "93:33", "we're looking at this image folks", "93:35", "it says gravity is not strong enough to", "93:37", "stop a small stream from flowing

would", "93:47", "look like if we lived on a globe gravity", "93:50", "is pseudoscience dot dot dot a theory", "93:54", "that can't be proven they forgot the", "93:57", "apostrophe and can't you fucking dumb", "93:58", "too that must be pretty well you look at", "94:01", "that image though it's hilarious why is", "94:03", "there water on the top at all how about", "94:05", "that you stupid fuck it's raining", "94:07", "relatives it rains on top only rise from", "94:10", "the bottom and comes around oh I would", "94:11", "be kind of cool if half the planet was", "94:12", "dirt and half the planet was water", "94:14", "colored why would that be any weirder", "94:16", "than what it is now you know the reason", "94:17", "they don't like gravity is that if you", "94:18", "actually apply the laws of gravity to a", "94:20", "flat earth the flood would actually", "94:22", "scrunch up into a ball oh oh yeah right", "94:25", "of all that rock here is no way you can", "94:27", "it can lay flat like yeah it would it", "94:30", "would it would either be like gravity", "94:32", "would be intensely large because you've", "94:34", "got any phenomenon to rock underneath", "94:35", "you or it's like something on the back", "94:37", "of a turtle or something anyway scrunch", "94:39", "up into a ball what do they think lavas", "94:41", "molten rocks I mean they just think it's", "94:43", "buoyant because it heats up and becomes", "94:45", "less dense than the other rock but why", "94:47", "is it why is it down there in the bottom", "94:49", "why is a core the fires of hell are", "94:51", "heating it up fires of hell look at this", "94:55", "what is this tennis ball you know why", "94:57", "doesn't water fly off the earth and then", "94:59", "because the", "95:01", "the forces spinning says this is this is", "95:03", "a fundamental misunderstanding a single", "95:05", "habit they miss them they misinterpret", "95:08", "angular velocity and linear velocity", "95:10", "like we know the earth is spinning", "95:11", "around a thousand miles an hour great so", "95:13", "they think like if this ball was", "95:14", "spinning around at a thousand", "95:16", "miles an hour then the water would would", "95:18", "fly off right but it's not flying off", "95:20", "because of the surface of the ball going", "95:23", "a thousand miles an hour it's flying off", "95:25", "because

a dinner oh yeah very time there", "114:38", "we're going to be out of the campsite", "114:40", "yeah looking at the Eclipse um anything", "114:43", "else for and it's all the same oh and", "114:49",

school", "114:58", "rooms has this really stretched out", "115:00", "Iceland Greenland", "115:03", "it looks like distorted it's not like", "115:05", "the real world the reason that we use", "115:07", "these maps this particular type of map", "115:09", "is that if you draw a line between two", "115:11", "points on the map and then you sail", "115:14", "along that heading you will end up at", "115:16", "point now this this is a type of", "115:20", "navigation called", "115:21", "run line navigation that's being used", "115:23", "for like hundreds of years and the thing", "115:26", "is that the map the Makeda map gets", "115:28", "stretched out to the top it also get", "115:30", "stretched out at the bottom because the", "115:32", "navigators of from hundreds of years ago", "115:34", "knew that the world was round and that", "115:36", "they knew if they drew a line between", "115:38", "two points in the southern hemisphere", "115:39", "using the same map it would get you to", "115:42", "that destination using rum navigation", "115:45", "which is it's basically just one more", "115:49", "piece of evidence that the actual the", "115:53", "global map matches reality because", "115:55", "people have used rum navigation for", "115:58", "hundreds of years if not thousands of", "115:59", "years so you're saying that the image of", "116:01", "the continents is in some ways stretched", "116:03", "out and distorted yeah we can take a", "116:04", "glider they do that", "116:05", "we will take a globe like just you can't", "116:07", "just put it onto a flat surface right", "116:10", "because you can have to distort it", "116:12", "somehow so there's various different", "116:14", "ways people use of putting it on on a", "116:17", "surface you could just take you know", "116:18", "your latitude and longitude and just map", "116:20", "it into a rectangle that works out", "116:21", "fairly well that's a nice thing that's", "116:23", "called a equirectangular map but the", "116:26", "most common map that was used like", "116:27", "before like say 30 years ago was this", "116:30", "Mercator projection which is the the map", "116:33", "that people use navigating ship routes", "116:35", "so you can get from point A to B if you", "116:37", "wanted to go from England to you know", "116:41", "North America across the ocean you just", "116:44", "draw a line between the two points and", "116:46", "then you say oh that's the heading I've", "116:48", "got to go in so you head off in that", "116:49", "heading now that doesn't take you in a", "116:51", "straight line it actually takes you in a", "116:53", "kind of a curved line because if you", "116:56", "keep going a constant compass heading on", "116:59", "a globe you actually kind of curve in", "117:01", "towards the poles or away from the poles", "117:03", "depending which way you're going I", "117:04", "really know I was 10 what you're saying", "117:06", "but all is is that there's this method", "117:09", "of navigation that people use that", "117:11", "relies upon the earth being a globe and", "117:13", "it's this very very simple map that is", "117:15", "in thousands of homes millions of homes", "117:17", "and schools that everybody uses and you", "117:20", "can see that on the map the lines get", "117:22", "smaller to what's often you get small as", "117:24", "well as the bottom and if people are", "117:25", "doing a voyage around the world they're", "117:27", "going to use this map", "117:29", "and it only works and it works on the", "117:31", "globe world that's another issue two", "117:32", "people have circumnavigated the globe", "117:34", "yeah well there's a major sail around", "117:36", "the outside which of course would take a", "117:38", "lot longer that's another thing like", "117:41", "that Australia", "117:42", "have you seen Australia on the Flat", "117:43", "Earth Map no it's like you sit on that", "117:47", "image that was up earlier it's like this", "117:49", "kind of squish thing you notice ray it", "117:50", "looks like it yeah it's more or less", "117:51", "like this looks like the earth it's kind", "117:54", "of like this it's all stretched out it's", "117:55", "like twice as long and half as wide have", "117:57", "you seen the theory and conspiracy", "117:59", "theory that Australia is scooby-doo no", "118:01", "let's give it to his head yeah yeah I", "118:04", "can see that it's just a joke Italy as a", "118:06", "boot yeah they just it's one of those", "118:08", "joke memes yeah so the distances between", "118:11", "places in Australia don't work is that", "118:14", "the flatter yeah yeah it's the Flat", "118:15", "Earth map and that's Australia and it's", "118:17", "really looks nothing like that and if", "118:18", "you lived in Australia you would know it", "118:19", "looks nothing at all like that which is", "118:22", "hilarious that there's so many versions", "118:23", "of this hilarious there's so many people", "118:26", "who have taken the time in front of a", "118:27", "computer to create this flat earth map", "118:30", "and put this ice wall and the idea that", "118:33", "how do they know it's an ice wall like", "118:35", "where where's the pictures there's", "118:37", "pictures of ice shelves from like", "118:40", "Antarctica so they think that's the", "118:42", "whole law you think that's the wall yeah", "118:43", "so that you'll see memes like yeah globe", "118:46", "earthers be like what flood what ice", "118:48", "wall and yeah be like agree on this and", "118:50", "let's show you the suck on that sitting", "118:52", "over an ice shelf which is a tuna fish I", "118:55", "wish you could fly over well that's the", "118:56", "mentality right it's a bunch of little", "118:57", "kids or a bunch of dumb people or a", "118:59", "bunch of people that have very little", "119:00", "education or a bunch of people that are", "119:02", "also speaking they're preaching to the", "119:04", "choir it ties into like misconceptions", "119:07", "that are natural like funny thing like", "119:09", "when I was in the video game industry", "119:11", "there's you know platform games you jump", "119:14", "from little platforms and sometimes you", "119:16", "have like platforms that move around", "119:17", "rather than like Mario type things right", "119:19", "in some video games when you jump up on", "119:21", "a moving platform and then jump down and", "119:24", "fall down you will fall down but the", "119:27", "platform moves out from underneath you", "119:28", "sometimes you jump up and you move with", "119:30", "the platform and you land on it", "119:31", "depends on what the programmer did right", "119:33", "now a friend of mine was doing a video", "119:37", "game and one of the programmers said", "119:39", "it's like oh if you jump up and then", "119:41", "jump down the platform should have moved", "119:42", "out from", "119:42", "underneath you so you should be able to", "119:44", "like a you should be able to you know", "119:47", "this is the way we should program the", "119:48", "physics and then my friend map said no", "119:50", "that's wrong and he couldn't convince", "119:53", "this other guy so eventually what", "119:55", "happened he says right what we're going", "119:56", "to do is we're going to go out onto the", "119:58", "road with my pick up my pickup truck I'm", "120:01", "going to get in the back and you're", "120:02", "going to drive along at 30 miles an hour", "120:04", "and I'm going to jump straight up in the", "120:05", "air and we're going to see whether I", "120:08", "land in the truck or I land on the road", "120:10", "so they did this experiment the guy the", "120:12", "other guy was driving the truck was", "120:13", "totally expecting him to like jump up", "120:15", "and then fall out of the back of a truck", "120:16", "because the truck wouldn't move done", "120:17", "because he's moving the same speed", "120:19", "whereas the truck three jumps up and", "120:21", "then he lands back in the truck right", "120:23", "and this that this is illustrating that", "120:25", "this video game programmer had the exact", "120:28", "same misconception that the flat", "120:29", "earthers do because they say oh wait the", "120:31", "earth is moving so fast why can't you", "120:33", "just go up in a helicopter hover a bit", "120:35", "wait for the earth to move underneath", "120:36", "you then go back down again", "120:38", "right it's just you know it's completely", "120:40", "backwards physics because you're already", "120:41", "moving so you'd have to slow down to", "120:43", "zero which is the same as speeding up", "120:46", "relatively speaking so my point is that", "120:50", "anyone can make misconceptions about", "120:53", "physics like that", "120:54", "yeah and it's easy to get sucked into it", "120:57", "and it's actually quite hard to break", "120:58", "them even below this reasonable guy who", "121:00", "was liking a video game programmer who", "121:02", "presumably knew something about physics", "121:03", "he was convinced that Matt was going to", "121:05", "fall out of the back of the truck and", "121:07", "quite possibly die so if I still only", "121:09", "did the experiment let's end it on that", "121:11", "because is literally hurting my brain", "121:13", "yeah but what you're doing is very", "121:15", "important and I really want to thank you", "121:17", "that your website is very important it's", "121:19", "very important for people who are", "121:20", "curious and concerned and don't", "121:22", "understand the physics and the logic and", "121:23", "the science behind it all but I've sent", "121:25", "your site to many many people that", "121:28", "believed or don't believe and we're", "121:31", "trying to figure out a way to explain it", "121:32", "so thank you thank you thank you thanks", "121:35", "for being our edge alright folks that's", "121:37", "it for the week", "121:37", "see ya", "121:40", "[Music]", "121:43", "[Applause]", "121:49", "[Music]", "English (auto-generated)"]
