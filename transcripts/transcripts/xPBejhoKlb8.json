easily but you would think", "08:42", "you would have a designate cartel you", "08:44", "would have cartels designated as", "08:45", "terrorists so now they're banks involved", "08:47", "in funding terrorism", "08:49", "so that would change things that's you", "08:52", "know there's a lot of things that would", "08:53", "happen", "08:54", "you know some some of these consequence", "08:56", "designating was a terrorist and sent", "08:59", "drones down there things that they kind", "09:01", "of don't talk about is that if a", "09:03", "terrorist designation does happen", "09:05", "most

"asylum seeking people can claim that now", "09:19", "it's a different thing you know that the", "09:22", "main argument that a lot of people say", "09:23", "is that cartels aren't can't be", "09:26", "considered a terrorist terrorist group", "09:29", "because they don't have political", "09:30", "aspirations the problem with that theory", "09:33", "is that we have a lot of political", "09:35", "killings by cartels in Mexico where they", "09:38", "shoot the candidate of one side of the", "09:40", "political spectrum because it's not good", "09:41", "for them so they influence politics they", "09:45", "also pay off a lot of politicians down", "09:46", "there and they also examples of the new", "09:50", "generation cartel from Wall Ihara", "09:52", "giving out Christmas gifts or groceries", "09:57", "to the poor basically doing hearts and", "09:59", "minds type tactics in the area are clear", "10:01", "political movements yeah so you know how", "10:06", "does it turn why is terrorism have to be", "10:08", "connected to politics well that's that's", "10:10", "in classical the classical definition of", "10:12", "that is of a terrorist group that's what", "10:15", "they're basing it on I think the cartels", "10:17", "and narco-terrorism is a thing in and of", "10:19", "itself it's a new phenomenon it should", "10:21", "be terrorism should be reclassified to", "10:24", "include it I think you know most people", "10:26", "that live through that type of situation", "10:28", "in that type of and in that diaper area", "10:31", "in the country they're facing some of", "10:32", "these cartel threats that have fled it", "10:34", "we'll call it what it is yeah terrorism", "10:37", "terrorism they're terrified yeah I mean", "10:39", "that's literally I mean who's more", "10:40", "terrifying than the cartels yeah so", "10:45", "what's going on with the Mormons now is", "10:48", "are they moving out of there now are", "10:51", "they gonna go back to Utah just take one", "10:52", "wife okay that's what it all started out", "10:55", "with right yeah well the fundamentalist", "10:57", "group and they they went down there and", "10:59", "kind of proceeded with their because", "11:01", "customs I'm in contact with with a few", "11:04", "of the members of that family and you", "11:06", "know cut", "11:07", "I was in contact before but when I went", "11:09", "on here they kind of like one of them", "11:10", "reached out hmm what's going on what's", "11:13", "up what do we need to do yeah and then", "11:16", "you know it was like a friendly hello", "11:18", "from them from past interactions and", "11:20", "then this happened and you know I kind", "11:24", "of advised a little bit but that's you", "11:25", "know it's it's a mess a lot of a lot of", "11:28", "they're leaving the communities down", "11:30", "there there's a lot of them down there a", "11:31", "lot of communities in Sonora", "11:33", "kalila and you know that leaving is", "11:39", "leaving the area it's just too dangerous", "11:41", "yeah it only makes sense I mean they", "11:46", "just don't have the arms they don't have", "11:47", "the tactics and power and and they're", "11:51", "also in the middle of one of the most", "11:52", "important regions in Mexico right now", "11:55", "for a lot of reasons main thing there's", "11:59", "two things that are really really kind", "12:01", "of happening in that region one the", "12:03", "traffic the trafficking of fentanyl and", "12:06", "heroin and all these drugs through one", "12:09", "of the main drug routes up into the u.s.", "12:11", "and there's a few factions fighting over", "12:14", "that region los Salazar which are a", "12:17", "small card self action that has", "12:20", "allegiances to Sinaloa cartel and the", "12:23", "linea cartel which is historically been", "12:25", "in control of Ciudad Juarez so they're", "12:29", "both kind of buying for control of the", "12:31", "area a few hours before the the massacre", "12:34", "actually took place there were a bunch", "12:36", "of firefights between these two factions", "12:38", "in the area so one of the main theories", "12:40", "is that these the this group of Mormons", "12:43", "basically were case of mistaken identity", "12:45", "kind of driving into some of the areas", "12:47", "where they're being protected by some of", "12:49", "these people it's one theory right the", "12:53", "other thing that people kind of need to", "12:55", "think about is that the largest my noble", "12:59", "my noble deposits of lithium on the", "13:02", "planet right now are a few hours away", "13:04", "from where that massacre took place", "13:05", "really yes and that is you know not", "13:09", "conspiracy theory or theorizing here but", "13:11", "it's a pretty important thing in that", "13:12", "region and there's a lot of interest in", "13:14", "that space and control for that space", "13:16", "and they're not mining it currently", "13:17", "there's a bunch of projects in play", "13:20", "right now", "13:21", "so they've identified the deposits yeah", "13:24", "you know people can look up the numbers", "13:25", "but it's it's the largest my novel", "13:28", "deposit of lithium on the planet well", "13:30", "and there was some sort of deal in the", "13:33", "past where a Canadian mining agency was", "13:35", "going to have rights to it and the", "13:37", "mining agency was bought by the Chinese", "13:40", "company so again after that Massacre a", "13:44", "lot of things happened a lot of the", "13:45", "negotiations happened that problem that", "13:47", "deal was one of the things that got", "13:48", "killed after that situation Oh No", "13:50", "all right so it's it's it's it's an", "13:53", "interesting area there's a lot of things", "13:55", "happening there that's got to put a", "13:56", "tremendous amount of pressure on the", "13:57", "cartels in some way right well", "13:59", "historically any sort of any sort of", "14:01", "mining operation usually has industry", "14:03", "around it which is perfect for the", "14:05", "cartels you know extortion protection", "14:09", "rackets feeding the the drug use in the", "14:13", "area from the workers you know that's is", "14:16", "there any way that you could see in the", "14:19", "future the cartels being extracted from", "14:23", "the positions of power that they're in", "14:24", "now I mean or is this something the", "14:26", "people in Mexico are gonna have to live", "14:27", "with forever and I guess people the", "14:29", "United States as well or is this", "14:30", "something that can be fixed you you've", "14:33", "you've talked about before in some of", "14:35", "your podcast and I listened to them a", "14:37", "lot great podcast thanks Gatewood great", "14:39", "you're on - thank you", "14:41", "you talk about legalization and how that", "14:44", "would help that definitely is part of", "14:45", "the solution and it is it is definitely", "14:48", "part of the solution legalizing some", "14:50", "drugs you know not all drugs are made", "14:51", "the same", "14:52", "maybe not fentanyl you know yeah but", "14:54", "that would help out some things there's", "14:57", "there's multiple things that could be", "14:59", "done to guide us towards a place where", "15:02", "things could save lives down there and a", "15:05", "lot of it is not gonna be able to be", "15:07", "done in Mexico it's gonna have to be", "15:08", "done up here right basically you know", "15:11", "when you you have to take care of the US", "15:13", "has to take care of the drug market up", "15:15", "here the illegal drug market and certain", "15:19", "things that have happened like", "15:20", "legalization of marijuana and marijuana", "15:21",

"talking to my friend John Norris who was", "15:33", "on here as well and comparing notes", "15:36", "seeing how a lot of the drug recruits", "15:39", "are up here the pot the illegal pot", "15:40", "grills are up here exactly like the ones", "15:42", "that I found in Baja six seven years ago", "15:45", "and how some of that drug money made", "15:48", "from those fields are staying in the", "15:50", "u.s. it's not being sent back so that", "15:52", "means you have an active growing cartel", "15:55", "presence in the US that is us-based", "15:57", "so I think that one of the the problems", "16:01", "that people have is perception is that", "16:03", "that's a Mexican problem it's a it's a", "16:05", "us-mexico problem you know you have", "16:08", "border there but the problem has two", "16:11", "root causes right social economic", "16:14", "inequality and destabilization and", "16:17", "corrupt government down there and a", "16:19", "thriving illegal drug market up here and", "16:22", "you know those two have to be solved to", "16:25", "set me in a combined way how many", "16:28", "members when you combine all the cartels", "16:32", "how many members are we talking about", "16:34", "that's that mean it's pretty hard to put", "16:37", "a number on how I will say this more", "16:40", "than a million I will say this they", "16:42", "defeated the Mexican army in

right", "17:20", "which is completely false I think", "17:23", "because you don't send 35 agents to", "17:26", "capture one of the the heads of one of", "17:30", "the biggest Sinaloa cartel cells right", "17:32", "so it's pretty much by chance they spot", "17:35", "at this party people were on there they", "17:37", "went there all of a sudden I'll chop one", "17:40", "is it so you think they
