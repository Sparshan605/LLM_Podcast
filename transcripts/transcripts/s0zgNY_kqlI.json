["00:01", "all right here we go", "00:03", "first of all welcome James", "00:06", "I really have now my pleasure and", "00:09", "welcome again Chris so this is", "00:13", "essentially giving you an opportunity to", "00:16", "refute some of the things that Chris has", "00:18", "said about your film we should tell", "00:19", "everybody that you the producer of", "00:21", "game-changers yeah I was one of those", "00:24", "users I know you also from of course", "00:26", "from The Ultimate Fighter yeah", "00:28", "UFC and Chris this is your what fourth", "00:31", "appearance your fourth or fifth did you", "00:35", "get a chance to see what Chris had said", "00:37", "yeah I've watched you watched it okay", "00:39", "I've made a bunch of notes excellent", "00:41", "let's start from the beginning the", "00:44", "beginning of the show the beginning of", "00:46", "your film you talked about the", "00:47", "gladiators and all that stuff and the", "00:50", "the fact that you were shocked to find", "00:52", "out the day they had eaten the", "00:54", "vegetarian diet yeah I mean well you", "00:57", "know that's been misrepresented right so", "00:58", "even before the film came out people", "01:00", "like oh there's this vegan film coming", "01:02", "out it's freaking propaganda people were", "01:04", "judging the film before they'd seen it", "01:05", "right and the vegan sort of community", "01:08", "really pushed it like a look at this", "01:09", "documentary so there's been things", "01:11", "saying they claimed that the gladiators", "01:13", "were vegan right and if we can just", "01:15", "prove they think the whole film is based", "01:17", "on this premise that was just like an", "01:18", "inciting incident for me start digging", "01:20", "into it first of all", "01:21", "Fabian Kent said they were predominantly", "01:23", "vegetarian and I said they ate mostly", "01:25", "plants and that is what I couldn't", "01:27", "believe right so they wouldn't claim", "01:29", "they were vegan didn't even claim that", "01:30", "they were vegetarian or just fueled", "01:32", "mostly by plants you know and people say", "01:34", "oh you cherry picked one location it was", "01:36", "the only known gladiator burial site in", "01:38", "the world based on archaeological and", "01:40", "anthropological data at the time at the", "01:42", "time where you read the study there have", "01:44", "been other studies there's been there's", "01:46", "some have been questioned so like", "01:47", "there's one in York there's one in New", "01:49", "York at the time had a few gladiator", "01:50", "skeletons", "01:51", "and it was questioned whether that was", "01:52", "the thing but I'm happy to address every", "01:55", "critique but if you wouldn't mind I just", "01:56", "want to make sure that Chris round the", "01:58", "same page about how evidence is", "02:00", "evaluated sure so would you consider", "02:02", "yourself a nutrition expert no I would", "02:08", "consider myself someone who", "02:10", "is adept at reading the literature and", "02:14", "learning from experts in nutrition", "02:17", "medicine anthropology etc although I do", "02:20", "have master's level training in", "02:23", "nutrition okay so it is it fair to say", "02:26", "that any one study cannot show what you", "02:30", "know the human race should be doing is", "02:31", "that fair any ones that absolutely", "02:33", "so basically anytime you show us study", "02:34", "if you say something you have to give a", "02:36", "citation for it right you have fair to", "02:38", "say and then someone can claim it as", "02:40", "cherry-picked is that you've got to show", "02:41", "a study or some studies and then someone", "02:43", "can claim as cherry-picked right so what", "02:45", "we have to do in order to understand", "02:46", "nutrition is look at the totality of the", "02:48", "evidence and I'd want to make sure we're", "02:49", "on the same page and then we can address", "02:51", "each critique that's okay so there's", "02:53", "that core of my argument right exactly", "02:55", "so you would say is it fair to say like", "02:57", "this three main area so there would be", "02:58", "like preclinical data which would either", "03:00", "be in animals or in test tubes petri", "03:02", "dishes right there'd be observational", "03:04", "data where you look at people and see", "03:07", "how they're doing and obviously there's", "03:08", "the health user but healthy use a bias", "03:10", "potential and there's interventional", "03:12", "trials right so let's just take", "03:13", "trans-fats for example right you you", "03:16", "look in a petri dish at endothelial", "03:19", "cells and trans-fats and it's you can", "03:20", "see that it creates vascular information", "03:23", "in those cells right and then you look", "03:26", "at people to eat more trans fats and", "03:27", "they have higher levels of information", "03:28", "and then you can actually do", "03:29", "interventional randomized control trials", "03:31", "and you can tell that trans fats cause", "03:33", "inflammation so we basically all agree", "03:36", "that trans fats are bad based on all of", "03:37", "those data points is that fair all right", "03:39", "so therefore again if you start any one", "03:42", "study people can just someone can just", "03:43", "claim that you're cherry-picking", "03:44", "right you can just say everyone can say", "03:47", "that I could say that you're joking you", "03:48", "i'm cherry-picking not necessarily", "03:50", "because there are many analyses and", "03:53", "reviews that are sure for this purpose", "03:55", "look at the totality of evidence here in", "03:58", "the film for example pointing to many", "04:00", "meta analyses that summarize all the", "04:03", "research that's been done on the topic", "04:05", "that i wouldn't have said that that's", "04:06", "cherry-picking fair enough i agree with", "04:09",

we're not because", "06:09", "the the main question here in my mind is", "06:13", "whether there's evidence that supports", "06:15", "being on a 100% plant-based diet with no", "06:19", "animal

diet", "11:11", "must be a hundred percent plant-based", "11:13", "and I wouldn't say okay okay okay you", "11:21", "did but this was the connection that you", "11:24", "made with cigarettes in the film no yes", "11:26", "I think they're both promoting something", "11:29", "bad because there's a profit so you", "11:31", "think that meat is bad for you they're", "11:33", "promoting it knowing

about the", "11:43", "consensus and the experts in their field", "11:45", "like I would understand this is what", "11:48", "actually not that interested in", "11:51", "consensus of experts I'm looking

know", "12:09", "dairy products caused cancer and I", "12:11", "pointed to a meta analyses that looked", "12:13", "at over a hundred and fifty different", "12:14", "reviews that 84% of those found

hundred and seven no this is", "12:50", "a 2019 1953 studies right yeah and I can", "12:55", "get I'm really a lot further into it not", "12:58", "the only one I'd love to because at nine", "13:00",

misleading", "13:08", "people on this study okay so if you can", "13:11", "bring up the slide 117", "13:14", "is that can we see this like yeah okay", "13:21", "this is it okay", "13:24", "so you see what he's putting quotes okay", "13:26", "84% of meta-analyses on dairy", "13:29", "consumption showed either no association", "13:31", "or an inverse association between dairy", "13:33", "and cancer and then you go on to point", "13:35", "out what an inverse means is that people", "13:36", "ate more dairy get lower rates of cancer", "13:38", "that's what he's implying when you put", "13:41", "something in quotes what does that mean", "13:42", "to you it means us what he said yeah but", "13:47", "it's that quotation is quoting the study", "13:49", "right fair enough", "13:51", "is that what they said in the study no", "13:53", "that's not what they said in the study", "13:54", "that's right my summary of the evidence", "13:58", "of the study thank you but when you put", "14:01", "something quite that's misleaders his", "14:02", "quote okay fine but he's not putting", "14:06", "things in one else totally I mean that's", "14:09", "how when you when you when you anything", "14:11", "you do in literature when you put some", "14:13", "in quotation marks you're quoting the", "14:14", "study but let's let's just bypass that", "14:16", "I'll agree okay so can you bring up side", "14:18", "109 see what they actually said okay", "14:23", "this is the actual quote 10 out of 153", "14:27", "reported meta analyses comparing highest", "14:29", "versus lower dairy consumption 109 71%", "14:32", "showed no evidence of a systole", "14:34", "significant association between dairy", "14:36", "consumption and instance of cancers 20", "14:38", "showed a decreased risk of cancers

what he", "14:50", "was doing okay if you want to go to I", "14:53", "mean just to sum it up if you go to", "14:54", "slide 110 wait but can we see what's", "14:58", "your interpretation what do you do you", "15:00", "agree that that was the quote from the", "15:01", "study okay good but I'm asking you what", "15:05", "your interpretation it does that in your", "15:07", "mind show a strong connection between", "15:09", "dairy and cancer okay Joe you're gonna", "15:11", "really realize here what Chris is doing", "15:13", "okay this is really and I'm glad that", "15:15", "you bought it please answer what okay so", "15:18", "can I just say the reason you brought", "15:20", "this up is because Walter Willett said", "15:21", "there was a strong connection in", "15:22", "prostate cancer and dairy correct yeah", "15:24", "so you brought about something about all", "15:25", "cancers", "15:26", "okay yeah so and in this study about", "15:28", "half of the study showed a connection", "15:31", "between prostate cancer and dairy and", "15:33", "half didn't what so not a compelling", "15:36", "argument that dairy is associated with", "15:39", "cancer okay so can we got you got a coin", "15:42", "flip basically slide 110 well let's", "15:51", "let's stay with this explain this first", "15:53", "not we'll move to that's known as", "15:54", "sliding excellent is explaining okay", "15:56", "it's just breaking that down okay so", "15:58", "there was statistically significant", "15:59", "associations between dairy consumption", "16:01", "instead of cancers 71 percent showed no", "16:03", "evidence thirteen showed a decreased", "16:06", "risk in a sixteenth century an increased", "16:08", "risk so you see what Chris did to", "16:09", "represent this he added 71 and thirteen", "16:12", "to make eighty-four right voila this is", "16:16", "how you got it right so you added", "16:18", "seventy three percent seventy one", "16:19", "percent and 13 percent to Gaetti four", "16:21", "right so his statement from this study", "16:23", "was 84% showed no evidence or decreased", "16:27", "risk that's what he made you believe", "16:29", "well 71 percent shows no evidence the 13", "16:32", "percent shows decrease right circle you", "16:33", "add the two of them together that's 84", "16:35", "percent shows no evidence a great", "16:37", "increase risk directly but he could have", "16:39", "said his 71 percent plus six teams and", "16:42", "that's eighty-seven percent", "16:44", "he could have said eighty-seven percent", "16:46", "showed no evidence or an increased risk", "16:49", "its 84 one plus 16", "16:53", "oh so I could make the claim no evidence", "16:56", "or a decreased you were claiming in the", "17:03", "film was claiming dairy causes cancer my", "17:06", "claim was there's no the burp the bulk", "17:08", "of the evidence suggests there is no", "17:10", "association or inverse association", "17:12", "that's true no I agree", "17:17", "13 percent shows decreased risk okay so", "17:20", "the hold on a second yeah the decreased", "17:22", "risk and the increased risk are almost", "17:24", "the same talked about which is higher 3%", "17:27", "shows interest and this one's not the", "17:30", "point of this study is that this is his", "17:32", "study that he brought up showing this is", "17:33", "very strong evidence okay his

buddy me ology is slippery and", "24:49", "I agree that not happy me ology works if", "24:52", "you've got if you have even if you had", "24:54", "ten studies showing no evidence just cuz", "24:56", "you don't find something doesn't mean", "24:57", "that it exists okay the absence of", "24:59", "evidence is not the evidence of absence", "25:00", "okay let's say this if you if you had a", "25:03",

that there is a correlation but", "25:32", "no no no we're not now we're doing 70", "25:35", "study if 70% look it was 70% of the", "25:38", "people in these studies if you have all", "25:39", "these studies you have 100 studies and", "25:41", "70% of the people in all these studies", "25:42", "are showing an increased risk of cancer", "25:44", "we would agree right this is why you", "25:46", "can't prove causation based on", "25:47", "observational but right now if it's", "25:52", "reversed now if 70% of these studies", "25:55", "show there's no increased risk of cancer", "25:57", "or 84% four eighty four percent which is", "25:59", "because you add in the decreased risk", "26:01", "when we're not even adding the decreased", "26:03", "risk which shows that you're less likely", "26:05", "to get cancer which is almost the same", "26:06", "as an increased risk of cancer which in", "26:09", "my eyes is a wash you would assume that", "26:11", "we're talking about something that", "26:12", "doesn't give you cancer well I mean that", "26:16", "that's I agree that this study found", "26:17", "that there were they couldn't prove a", "26:19", "causation right they couldn't prove a", "26:20", "link between cancer but you made it out", "26:22", "like he was being deceptive is being", "26:23", "deceptive I don't agree that I don't", "26:25", "agree with that because you try", "26:26", "you're trying to show that these studies", "26:29", "are proving or at least making this", "26:32", "correlation between consumption of dairy", "26:35", "products and cancer but the evidence", "26:37", "doesn't show that if you want to look at", "26:39", "it in its entirety the evidence shows", "26:41", "that most of the 71% showed no evidence", "26:45", "of it causing cancer",

about", "26:58", "epidemiology studies when you're talking", "26:59", "about you know 16 out of a hundred you", "27:02", "you have to throw in all the other facts", "27:05", "right and that's why they didn't find it", "27:07", "but can I just the reason you brought", "27:08", "this up is prostate cancer right and and", "27:11", "so if you look at slide one thirteen", "27:13", "prostate cancer was that's disturbing so", "27:16", "it's 5050 with dairy consumption versus", "27:19", "that's not one try one thirteen but a", "27:22", "lot of people get prostate cancer too", "27:23", "isn't that an also an issue that's a", "27:26", "high as well isn't that a high risk for", "27:29", "males prostate cancer yes it's a high", "27:32", "one whether it's our 112 whether they", "27:34", "consume milk or not", "27:36", "so just so in this metric Lance that you", "27:39", "point to the highest connection that", "27:41", "they could find between dairy and any", "27:43", "type of cancer was processing cancer so", "27:45", "if you look at the black line that shows", "27:47", "no association if you look at the green", "27:48", "line that's decreased Association and", "27:50", "the red line was

fallacy and message", "28:34", "that appeal to valid Authority because", "28:37", "literally if I want to know are you", "28:39", "saying like so if", "28:40", "I want let me look at mixed martial

there's no reliable no", "29:10", "there's no reliable proven connection", "29:13", "between dairy and prostate you have half", "29:15", "studies showing an association half", "29:18", "studies showing no association not to", "29:20", "mention the fact that that's as you just", "29:23", "said that even if there was a strong", "29:25", "correlation that doesn't prove causation", "29:28", "you said you like this because it", "29:30", "included also randomized controlled", "29:32", "trials yeah and I think should be should", "29:34", "be trust Walter Willett who at the time", "29:36", "was the chairman Justice studies but", "29:41", "we're way off here the question was", "29:45", "still you know the there are a lot of", "29:47", "inferences made in the film whether you", "29:51", "they were intentional or not on your", "29:52", "part that you know dairy people are", "29:55", "hearing o'deary is gonna cause prostate", "29:57", "cancer they're gonna extend that to", "29:59", "cancer there are other claims in the", "30:01", "film made about dairy and metabolic prop", "30:03", "and saturated fat and metabolic issues", "30:06", "so the operative question that I'm", "30:10", "trying to answer is do the data support", "30:12", "that not just Walter Willett think that", "30:14", "or any other expert in the film do the", "30:16", "data support that conclusion right and", "30:19", "even in that study it the data don't", "30:23", "strongly support that if you have half", "30:24", "studies saying yes half studies saying", "30:26", "no that's not a clear signal and it's", "30:28",

there's you know it's causal that", "30:39", "capacitor by the study can I posit", "30:43", "didn't you tell me that two-thirds of", "30:44", "people have an intolerance towards", "30:48", "towards

point so two out of three people", "31:01", "have an intolerance towards dairy in the", "31:04", "world and if you're talking about a", "31:06", "study that shows 50% of the people in", "31:09",

"31:56", "isn't you would see even better results", "31:58", "for dairy because despite the fact that", "32:00", "some people are lactose intolerant we're", "32:03", "still seeing in that

cancer thing is", "32:17", "not moles why this is 50/50 right no and", "32:20", "what you're saying you're saying if half", "32:22", "of okay but if there he gives half", "32:24", "people cancer right and doesn't give", "32:25", "their dog answer and I can just think", "32:27", "dairy second of all do you see what", "32:28", "Christmas did that's not what that's Ted", "32:30", "but you see ology James it's not dairy", "32:33", "gives anyone cancer it's Association oh", "32:36", "that's your meta analysis included", "32:38", "randomized nice time this is actually to", "32:40", "you can I stop this though wouldn't if", "32:43", "someone's intolerant of something that", "32:45", "means your body is irritated by it means", "32:47", "it causes some sort of disturbance right", "32:49", "whether it's inflammation or", "32:51", "gastrointestinal disorder you start", "32:53", "farting and that's what happens when", "32:55", "people are lactose intolerant right that", "32:57", "irritates the

know you", "61:50", "should eat plant foods right we both", "61:53", "agree that you should probably a lot of", "61:54", "plant foods right which is my position I", "61:56", "think it would be

right it's like the", "63:11", "my argument leaders you're getting vast", "63:13", "majority of your calories from whole", "63:14", "plant foods right okay agreed okay you", "63:17", "agree well I don't think the vast", "63:19", "majority is my position but I think", "63:21", "that's his position right I agree what", "63:23", "he's saying I think that look I I eat", "63:28", "animal products I have for a long time", "63:30", "and I eat a lot of vegetables as well I", "63:32", "think that an omnivorous diet is is the", "63:36", "key to health that's what I believe yeah", "63:38", "I I believe that meat helps you recover", "63:40", "faster I think it's more nutrient rich I", "63:43", "think there's things in me that it's", "63:45", "very difficult to get in plants and I", "63:47",

I said I said they'd get it", "67:16", "from the bacteria that they got from the", "67:18", "soil so you misrepresented what I said", "67:20", "you you know that the key claims you", "67:23", "made

don't", "85:28", "accept the 40% number even though that", "85:30", "you said that I didn't say I didn't", "85:31", "accept that it doesn't matter whether", "85:34", "you accept it or not it like

that you are", "85:44", "saying that rails are going in this", "85:47", "they're saying the vitamins not getting", "85:49", "absorbed in the b12 also my point was", "85:52", "it's safer to just take a b12 supplement", "85:54", "and for the general population in the", "85:56", "world that is the best recommendation", "85:58", "you'll say you can go to your doctors", "86:01", "and get a $60 blood test and test would", "86:03", "be 12 and then you can decide whether", "86:04", "you need a supplement or not they may", "86:06", "stop you guys both here why isn't it", "86:07", "getting absorbed", "86:08", "there is a higher level of vitamin b12", "86:10", "and fish and there's other factors that", "86:12", "inhibit the absorption so what are zero", "86:14", "is one yeah when likely vegetables", "86:16", "conditions but also in our growth in the", "86:19", "small intestine so Sojo so basically um", "86:23", "but we still have the data about cuz i", "86:27", "said the best safest way for everyone to", "86:29", "get b12 is to take a supplement well", "86:30", "right you say well you can just spend", "86:32", "sixty dollars and get a blood test but", "86:34", "you've got to recognize in the world not", "86:37", "everybody can afford a facility okay", "86:39", "so the safest way to get b12 if whether", "86:42", "you eat me or not is to get take a b12", "86:44",

"86:53", "11% of omnivores have b12 depletion", "86:56", "versus 77% of vegetarians and 92% of", "86:59", "vegans you know that's with using whole", "87:02", "of Transco Ballymun which is a much more", "87:04", "sensitive marker b12 deficiency than", "87:06", "serum b12 which is really problematic", "87:08", "and then you have nine out of ten", "87:11", "comparisons of homocysteine that

b12", "87:42", "depletion it's not technically the", "87:44", "deficiency at that point and then you", "87:46", "have homocysteine and methylmalonic acid", "87:48", "that are more sent less sensitive than", "87:51", "holo Transco bellmen but more sensitive", "87:53", "than serum b12 okay okay can you bring", "87:56", "up slide 54 please okay and I need to", "88:01", "show you so not only if you got all the", "88:03", "facts wrong so far about b12 or my", "88:06", "claims you said that they were all false", "88:07", "and they weren't false right every claim", "88:09", "that I made so far was

alamo", "88:29", "omnivores vegetarians and vegans vegans", "88:31", "now we got to remember that most people", "88:34", "are probably listening versus Wow sorry", "88:36", "yeah okay so vegans 92 percent", "88:38", "it says 77 vegetarians 77% and omnivores", "88:42", "11 percent for b12 depletion but that", "88:46", "study showed it was more like 40 percent", "88:49", "of depletion even across the board I'm", "88:51", "not trying to compare the two okay I'm", "88:53", "just trying to say your case by using", "88:55", "the study is that 90 percent of vegans", "88:57", "are deficient in b12

the next slide", "89:08", "please Chris", "89:09", "I think it's slide 55 okay this is from", "89:15", "the study okay this is from 16 years ago", "89:18", "by the way and a very small study from", "89:20", "16 years ago and this is why I show you", "89:21", "that he's hand picking the data that he", "89:23", "uses and this is where I go back to the", "89:25", "fact that it's about the interpretation", "89:26", "of the totality of evidence and you", "89:27", "can't really rely on something that's", "89:29", "not a nutrition expert hand picking", "89:31", "studies to suit their bias so in sub", "89:33", "this is what it said in subjects who did", "89:35", "not consume vitamins the levels were", "89:39", "what Chris said right 11 percent in", "89:41", "omnivores 70 percent and so I would", "89:43", "agree like if you couldn't get b12", "89:45", "anywhere you should incorporate some", "89:46", "animal foods into your diet fat okay but", "89:49", "let's look at some other

because some people", "90:00", "don't supplement right but it's like you", "90:02", "I'm showing it you hadn't picked a study", "90:03", "from 16 years ago slide 56 from and this", "90:08", "is for a

and then flied 58 it would be", "90:57", "and this one not only backs up my point", "91:00", "about vegans but also and plant-based", "91:03", "leaders but also the supplement is", "91:06", "better so

cleared up", "99:18", "what was what was misrepresented right", "99:21", "and it's really why I really appreciate", "99:23", "you having me on", "99:24", "because that you guys did like a", "99:26",

okay", "100:09", "because we really should finish that we", "100:10", "can always yeah sure protein cuz I'm", "100:12", "sure protein is gonna be a long", "100:13", "discussion well I know I think it's", "100:15", "gonna happen here so we can talk about", "100:16", "red meat showing that like some of the", "100:18", "individual things like heme iron for", "100:20", "example are shown to be

up what Joe does slide 62 because I", "103:10", "mention this earlier but we didn't put a", "103:11", "slide on but I think the graphic again I", "103:13", "know mystery listening so if maybe Joe",

is 4 times 5 20 right and", "151:01", "and then by per USDA how much is one", "151:05", "piece of whole wheat bread 4 or 5", "151:10", "depending on the source you look at I", "151:12", "agree how many pieces of bread - yeah", "151:15", "okay so 5 grams of protein in bread the", "151:17", "one that I actually have a home is 6", "151:18", "grams but let's take USDA ok her five", "151:21", "five

is", "199:31", "worth three and a half hours in right", "199:33", "well I would have made a 10 hour film", "199:34", "and I it was upsetting sure you really", "199:36", "people say oh you first of all the color", "199:38", "audience that were married", "199:40", "half of the athletes you found you", "199:43", "didn't put in the film because they", "199:44", "stopped being vegan completely not true", "199:46", "you're also a bunch of experts we didn't", "199:48", "put in the film that we couldn't put in", "199:49", "and we didn't put them in because there", "199:52", "wasn't room it was

"200:34", "hasn't refuted your criticism we just", "200:36", "put that last slide", "200:37", "yes please what is it again in slide 34", "200:39", "and also I've got a bunch of slides", "200:41",
