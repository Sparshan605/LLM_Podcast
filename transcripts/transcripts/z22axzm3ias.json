not it's not", "13:31", "something that yeah you're right P P it", "13:34", "scares the shit up you know why cuz it", "13:36", "is scary I think it's it's intense life", "13:38", "some cans you know

important point about being alone too", "14:48", "because when you're around other people", "14:49", "other people influence your thoughts the", "14:52", "influence way you feel the influence the",

"25:24", "the top that's so high up that beavers", "25:27", "don't go there so you can drink right", "25:29", "out of the lake so we would take our", "25:30", "water bottles we just dip it in the lake", "25:32", "and just drink right out of it so this", "25:35", "place is almost the exact opposite of", "25:37", "that", "25:38", "whereas that place is all just rain and", "25:43", "and lush greenery and the occasional", "25:46", "sunshine pops through you like wow oh", "25:49", "look at this place it shines like a", "25:51", "green but an emerald yeah", "25:54", "Suz you rather get dropped off they keep", "25:56", "me here they're naked they're there you", "26:02", "probably make it better you wouldn't", "26:05", "make it here naked your skin would peel", "26:07", "off",

enough", "26:16", "to be a large thing to kill a bunch of", "26:20", "squirrels to sew them together make a", "26:21", "dick holster got a lot of shit and then", "26:27", "again if you just naked that means you", "26:28", "don't even have a gun or a bow and arrow", "26:30", "and that's not good then those things", "26:32", "are good I think that Prince of Wales", "26:34", "was like the most profound of all though", "26:37", "that experience like I felt through the", "26:39", "Missouri Breaks", "26:40", "that that feeling of like just complete", "26:43", "did not detachment but like it doesn't", "26:48", "give a fuck", "26:49", "then the landscape does not give a fuck", "26:51", "it is just completely oblivious to your", "26:54", "presence and it has existed in this form", "26:57", "for thousands and thousands and", "26:59", "thousands of years did you get that feel", "27:00", "like YouTube yeah yeah yeah definitely", "27:03", "I was curious because both of those", "27:05", "haunts both of Missouri Breaks and", "27:08", "we're not motorized you know so like", "27:11", "Missouri Breaks we drop the cars off", "27:13", "have you Oded truly you know you call", "27:15", "that a true wilderness experience and", "27:17", "same time Prince of Wales that we got", "27:19", "dropped out by a plane Andy if we needed", "27:21", "to get out there and get a pitch you", "27:23", "know we're getting out of there in a", "27:25", "bitchy it would have been so I was", "27:27", "wondering if that was a little bit of", "27:28", "the feeling you got but yeah there's a", "27:29", "little bit more of an ominous set", "27:32", "incentive situations yeah here we had a", "27:34", "truck that we would drive to the top of", "27:37", "his hill and then for the top of the", "27:38", "hill we walked and fuck did we walk Dan", "27:41", "Tony and I walked up hills at 9,000 foot", "27:45", "elevation some steep fucking kills two", "27:48", "hours and hours every day dude I was", "27:51", "hurtin but it was a great cardio though", "27:55", "awesome workout", "27:59", "so you were telling me about these", "28:00", "wilderness trips that you take people on", "28:03", "that you like wilderness therapy yeah so", "28:07", "my for my first job out of college I've", "28:10", "been living in Panama with my", "28:11", "ex-girlfriend we were moving to Utah and", "28:14", "I just needed a job and I didn't know", "28:16", "what I was gonna do and so when I", "28:19", "Craigslist and we looked insulted the", "28:21", "area around Salt Lake City and there was", "28:22", "a job advertisement for a wilderness", "28:24", "guide or wilderness instructor they", "28:27", "called it I didn't know this shit", "28:29", "existed at that point so yeah there's", "28:31", "there's a huge industry and most of its", "28:34", "in the western United States but their", "28:35", "therapeutic wilderness programs which", "28:38", "are tied to a bunch of therapeutic", "28:40", "boarding schools so in the most basic", "28:43", "sense there's kids from generally pretty", "28:46", "wealthy families across the country that", "28:48", "are having trouble their parents don't", "28:50", "know what to do and they'll send them", "28:52", "away you know as an intervention and", "28:55", "usually the intention is that to have", "28:57", "these kids go to a boarding school where", "28:59", "there's a therapeutic presence also but", "29:01", "in order to get into those schools those", "29:04", "schools require a wilderness sustain so", "29:07", "so I work for a program and went out", "29:11", "there and just kind of it was it was a", "29:15", "the type of program where everything was", "29:17", "made by hands he got out there you were", "29:18", "given a half of the milk hide you're", "29:20", "given a knife and then you were taught", "29:22", "some of the basic skills so we had to", "29:24", "make our own backpacks out of sticks and", "29:26", "al-qaeda we would sew our own moccasins", "29:28", "you do all that kind of stuff and all", "29:30", "the fire that we made we had to make by", "29:33", "hand you know with a bow drill whoa", "29:35", "so yeah so it was it was this amazing it", "29:38", "was really life-changing for me because", "29:39", "I you know I love the outdoors I love", "29:42", "the wilderness and all that kind of", "29:43", "stuff and I didn't know what I want to", "29:45", "do with my life but got out to this", "29:47", "place where there's literally walked out", "29:50", "into the actually it looks a lot like", "29:52", "this where I work so just these massive", "29:54", "brown dry", "29:56", "and got out there these groups of kids", "29:59", "some of these kids would stay in these", "30:01", "programs for 90 to 120 days so literally", "30:05", "and here's the part that I still very", "30:08", "much don't agree with and I don't like", "30:10", "is that these programs would literally", "30:11", "kidnap you out of your bed there's", "30:13", "companies oh really but yeah man yeah", "30:16", "so there's like you can do that for a", "30:18", "job you can be kind of a heavy or a", "30:20", "tough guy that literally goes for an", "30:22", "intervention flies to a family's home", "30:25", "takes the kid out of their bed and flies", "30:28", "them and drops them in the middle of the", "30:29", "wilderness and it's it's a as you can", "30:32", "imagine it's traumatic man it's it's not", "30:34", "like you know all these kids usually 14", "30:38", "to 19 whoa", "30:40", "19 that's an adult yeah well that's", "30:42", "where you get sketchy is fun so that's", "30:44", "sketchy look maybe I should say", "30:46", "fortunately and their adult too", "30:49", "yeah so they have ways to sort of", "30:51", "override the age system at bad times", "30:55", "yeah so these programs are meant to sort", "31:00", "of give the kid a chance to", "31:03", "look at their lives other than behaving", "31:06", "and an opportunity let's just not like", "31:08", "we were talking about but reflect and", "31:09", "sort of explore and learn and there's", "31:11", "there's actually there's a lot of good", "31:13", "there's a lot of good that happens like", "31:15", "it really does help people and there's", "31:18", "in my opinion there's a lot of bad - I", "31:20", "don't think you can ever imagine that", "31:22", "you could literally kidnap a kid out of", "31:24", "your house and not fuck up the trust you", "31:26", "have but yeah yeah it's messed up yeah", "31:31", "but that's it so I did that for I", "31:33", "started there and then I started working", "31:34", "in more state-run sort of correctional", "31:38", "programs so for a long time I led the", "31:41", "trips in Minnesota that were there was a", "31:44", "21 days sentence but it was basically an", "31:48", "alternative to a 60 day juvie seven so", "31:51", "basically steal a car you can either go", "31:54", "the judge can either send you to juvie", "31:55", "for 60 days or send them to me and then", "31:59", "we'd go on a badass like you know 200", "32:02", "mile hiking Trevor's well it's", "32:03", "definitely take that over juvie oh yeah", "32:05", "one but yeah for obvious reason but then", "32:08", "the other reasons too is that you know", "32:11", "these programs are generally run by it", "32:14", "really like grounded good", "32:17", "people that treat people at least the", "32:18", "ones I always work for my I worked for", "32:20", "programs with really like exemplary", "32:23", "leadership ahead you know I think what", "32:27", "these kids can learn in those programs", "32:28", "as opposed to going to juvie", "32:32", "you know the shitholes that doors are it", "32:33", "was it was a really bad much better", "32:35", "option you know yeah I would imagine", "32:37", "that some way way better option but just", "32:40", "a kidnapping part is crazy", "32:43", "they've given up on discipline their", "32:46", "kids so much that they just say alright", "32:49", "okay I fucked up raising this kid it's", "32:52", "time to just electroshock therapy jolt", "32:55", "them with wilderness totally and it's a", "32:59", "long slow uncomfortable shock so when", "33:06", "you get these kids so like if you think", "33:08", "they're kidnapped how many days into", "33:11", "this kidnapping do you meet them well", "33:14", "day one I mean right away yes a lot of", "33:16", "programs have kind of like an in-between", "33:18", "camp so you come in and maybe the first", "33:20", "two weeks like a halfway house yeah yeah", "33:23", "I like wilderness up where else like a", "33:25", "like a base camp you don't like where", "33:27", "you learn how to do some of the skills", "33:29", "and maybe you start so the other thing", "33:32", "is there's relationships with a", "33:34", "therapist", "33:36", "that's how it works so there's the", "33:38", "people that work with the kids directly", "33:39", "are like what I did which as an", "33:42", "instructor so usually there'd be two of", "33:43", "us two adults with a group of ten kids", "33:46", "and it was all all boy usually say", "33:50", "you're getting into the in female and", "33:51", "female so I pretty much just worked with", "33:53", "dudes for a long long long long time so", "33:56", "it's the instructors would lead the days", "33:58", "and you'd usually hike or float or", "34:01", "whatever you're doing you know most of", "34:03", "the day and then you would run", "34:05", "she called circles are like processing", "34:08", "things where everybody would you really", "34:10", "a lot of it was came down to learning", "34:12", "how to communicate and can he get it", "34:14", "honestly and openly it's really good act", "34:16", "I learned a lot by being there doing it", "34:19", "but then once a week or twice a week a", "34:21", "therapist would drop in somehow", "34:22", "magically and have therapy sessions with", "34:26", "everybody huh", "34:27", "so a therapist they didn't even know", "34:29", "well they developed a relationship with", "34:32", "them you know and they work with you for", "34:33", "you know three to four months that they", "34:35", "were there so they became a pretty close", "34:39", "you know usually they became pretty", "34:41", "close to the therapist too", "34:43", "so did that did it stick with many of", "34:46", "these kids have so many questions did it", "34:48", "stick with them like how many of them", "34:50", "like that experience actually changed", "34:52", "their life so that yeah good good a good", "34:54", "question and I don't think anybody has", "34:56", "the actual hard numbers on that maybe", "34:58", "some people are looking to get that they", "35:00", "call ever sit it isn't right like if you", "35:02", "end up back you know I know for a fact", "35:07", "that I say contact with a ton all the", "35:11", "kids that I worked with just cuz you", "35:13", "know we got to know each other really", "35:14", "well then respect each other and became", "35:17", "friends and I know I've seen the benefit", "35:22", "almost across the board like like good", "35:25", "things learned a lot of growing up", "35:27", "happened you know something it's kind of", "35:29", "like a forced right rite of passage in a", "35:31", "sense you know that force force for", "35:34", "inner passage which I've you know don't", "35:36", "agree with the first part a lot of I", "35:38", "know a bunch of those kids I could point", "35:40", "to 12 right now that I know just kind of", "35:45", "turned around and maybe went to college", "35:47", "or didn't go to college but ended up", "35:48", "have a good relationships with their", "35:50", "family are feeling good about life but", "35:53", "then there's probably far far I know", "35:56", "there's far more", "35:57", "that didn't necessarily happen I don't", "36:00", "necessarily think it was a bad deal for", "36:01", "them to go through that experience but", "36:05", "it's it's not a it's not a cure-all but", "36:07", "what it does I think itself selects fur", "36:09", "for people who really do kind of want to", "36:12", "figure shit out because it gives you a", "36:14", "break at a good time to do that but ya", "36:19", "know I wish I had I wish I had more", "36:21", "numbers on it how much resistance did", "36:23", "you experience

that", "69:04", "point there's this been this thing that", "69:06", "I've been paying attention to that I", "69:07", "think is happening so as we have more", "69:10", "information and as things happen
