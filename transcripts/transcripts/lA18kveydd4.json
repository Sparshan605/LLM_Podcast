essentially what they did is bring", "08:18", "it back to where it was before the Obama", "08:22", "administration changed it so it was it", "08:25", "was listed a certain way and then when", "08:28",

get some oil", "08:54", "out of a Salmon River Hotel yeah man I", "08:57", "mean there was that one place we've", "08:59", "discussed it before up in Alaska where a", "09:02", "lot of people are concerned that there", "09:03", "was going to be some drilling that takes", "09:05", "place near near where salmon live like", "09:09", "close enough that if it fucked up it", "09:11", "could destroy this River and it fucks up", "09:14", "that's the probably the best way to say", "09:16", "it right because if if we're if we don't", "09:18", "do anything about it I say if you put a", "09:20", "pipeline in the earth and you pump oil", "09:22", "through it and we don't do anything we", "09:24", "just leave it there just leave it there", "09:26", "and we don't you know we don't visit it", "09:30", "for 5,000 years this is what that gonna", "09:33", "be like so what does that mean it means", "09:35", "you got to keep fixing it okay so you", "09:38", "put a hole you put a giant tube through", "09:40", "the earth and you're pumping toxic ooze", "09:42", "out of this tube and sometimes it gets", "09:45", "into rivers and it fucking kills", "09:46", "everything and there's you want to run", "09:49", "this fuck you want to run this tube", "09:51", "under the river okay and then what are", "09:53", "you gonna do like how many every year", "09:56", "every five years would how long how", "09:58", "often do you check in and when you", "10:00", "replace shit how long those tubes last I", "10:02", "don't know they gotta check it out I", "10:04", "almost got into that what happens if", "10:07", "there's an earthquake and those tubes", "10:10", "break fuck city Wyatt how does that work", "10:15", "I don't know jack-shit about how they", "10:17", "pump the oil out do you what were you", "10:19", "gonna say well it's some I mean it's a", "10:25", "weird thing if we know for sure they're", "10:27", "gonna one day break like we're making", "10:29", "that toxic pipeline we know for sure", "10:31", "it's gonna the Earth's gonna just absorb", "10:33", "it right everything fucking yeah", "10:35", "everything have you seen them show like", "10:37", "a five-year depiction of what would", "10:39", "happen to our bridges if we stopped", "10:41", "painting yeah yeah it looks like it", "10:43", "happens overnight", "10:44", "wasn't there a show about this called", "10:47", "life after humans or yes yeah was that", "10:50", "unlike NatGeo or discovery something", "10:52", "something like that yeah there's a bunch", "10:54", "of spots particularly look at the", "10:57",

but it is", "11:53", "it's weird that's a weird one the", "11:56", "weirdest one for sure is nuclear power", "11:58", "plants that's the weirdest one because", "12:01", "they can't shut him off when

that happen but he's", "12:56", "supported by Elon Musk and another other", "12:58", "big-time dudes don't want to see it", "13:01", "happen well he would be the thing you I", "13:04", "don't know if once those nuclear", "13:07", "reactors get up and running like the", "13:08", "old-style ones like Fukushima I don't", "13:11", "know if they have like a way to shut", "13:13", "those down", "13:14",

they", "13:23", "couldn't cool it they couldn't keep it", "13:24", "cool mm-hmm dude they can't shut him off", "13:27", "like that is the crazy they've only had", "13:30", "them for if you stop and

like ridiculous low", "14:42", "degree and and do something correct me", "14:45", "if I'm wrong this sounds like I'm making", "14:46", "this up", "14:47", "I bet Paul Stamets could come up with a",

black as", "15:25", "the oil starts to be absorbed by them", "15:28", "then", "15:28", "breakdown every single carbon in the oil", "15:31", "until eventually the oyster mushroom", "15:33", "becomes white again and it's fucking", "15:35", "edible Wow lately breaks it down and", "15:37", "these are giant oyster mushrooms like", "15:40", "just fucking massive dude you're gonna", "15:43", "get BP

scientists drop like billions", "16:01", "of spores what is this I don't know as", "16:03", "they are might not work in the ocean", "16:04", "which kajan if they did do it and it did", "16:07", "work and you see these fucking building", "16:10", "size mushrooms just sucking oil out of", "16:13", "the ocean to be awesome", "16:15", "it'll be crazy and then they turn white", "16:16", "and they become edible and then just got", "16:20", "to figure out how to do that with", "16:20", "psilocybin and we're golden", "16:22", "oh yeah oh that would be an easy fix to", "16:26", "find some way to blend the two of them", "16:28", "together don't cry little crossbreed", "16:31", "could they do that I know they do that", "16:32", "with plants right they got to be able to", "16:34", "do that huh how do they do that with", "16:36", "plants because it you know someone told", "16:39", "me that blew me away that there was they", "16:43", "were they were making pistachio trees", "16:46", "and they were binding them somehow", "16:49", "another two avocado trees and they were", "16:53", "making them like grow together to make", "16:55", "like a sturdier branch structure and", "16:59", "what I've
