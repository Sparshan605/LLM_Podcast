of testosterone", "03:03", "that they're making testosterone from", "03:05", "yams right grand that now they're doing", "03:09", "it through animals yeah they are so you", "03:12", "know one of the most accurate tests now", "03:14", "to use is called the carbon isotope", "03:16", "ratio test and what that's able to do is", "03:19", "differentiate between natural", "03:21", "testosterone which all men and women", "03:23", "have in their body and foreign", "03:25", "testosterone because there's a different", "03:27", "carbon atom in that testosterone because", "03:29", "it's made from a plant instead of an", "03:31", "animal there's now you know Leeson", "03:34", "research supply companies i don't think", "03:37", "it's approved for use but there's", "03:39", "animal-based testosterone floating", "03:41", "around which has the potential to", "03:43", "possibly defeat a carbon isotope ratio", "03:46", "test because it has the same carbon atom", "03:48", "as natural testosterone does is there", "03:50", "any hesitation in talking about these", "03:52", "things because you worry that you might", "03:54", "educate cheaters no i don't think so i", "03:56", "think you know I've always found that", "03:59", "you know your credibility Rises when", "04:01", "you're forthright about what's going on", "04:03", "and because on the other side of things", "04:06", "you know the sciences you know looking", "04:09", "at these things and always coming up", "04:10", "with new tests I think something that's", "04:12", "fact I just read it today and we do this", "04:15", "in our program as well is there was in", "04:18", "cycling they will freeze samples both", "04:21", "urine and blood and keep them for years", "04:22", "at a time and cycling just recently went", "04:25", "back and retested", "04:26", "some of the frozen urine and blood from", "04:29", "a few years ago for a new drug would say", "04:33", "just developed a test for and they were", "04:36", "able to catch a guy from a couple years", "04:37", "ago that had used it we're going to do", "04:39", "that in UFC as well so even if you know", "04:41", "there's a new drug out there that you", "04:44", "know scientists chemists are saying", "04:46", "there's no test for potentially a couple", "04:49", "years down the line when there is a test", "04:50", "for it we'd have the ability to go back", "04:52", "and test that now maybe that athletes no", "04:54", "longer with the UFC or no longer", "04:56", "competing at all anymore but you know", "04:58", "there's still reputation and legacy at", "05:01", "stake wow that's crazy so the UFC is", "05:03", "gonna have like a giant meat locker", "05:04", "filled with old blood and pee yes", "05:07", "laboratories will have that yeah wow", "05:09", "that's uh that's fascinating stuff but", "05:12", "doesn't it well there's a chain of", "05:14", "evidence issue with that isn't there was", "05:15", "just sitting around in some sort of a", "05:17", "lab somewhere what is it means yeah", "05:19", "they'll be secure you know freezers", "05:21", "where there is a chain of custody that", "05:23", "goes along with each sample so outside", "05:25", "that freezer will be guard the paperwork", "05:27", "now but they're very lot of laboratories", "05:30", "are very secure laboratories yeah try to", "05:33", "get in them before the tough you're", "05:35", "signing off your life to get in one of", "05:37", "those things but no so there's the chain", "05:40", "of custody will be good you know going", "05:42", "on indefinitely on those things so so", "05:44", "far as you know this hasn't been", "05:46", "approved where people haven't used this", "05:48", "animal-based testosterone yet i believe", "05:51", "is being used now you
