what's happened so far", "05:00", "with tanks with these chambers right we", "05:02", "think they're going to be every we don't", "05:04", "think so I'm pretty well sure of it at", "05:06", "this point because I have a I have a", "05:09", "realistic vision of the situation and", "05:12", "I'm convinced at this point that indeed", "05:15", "it is going to work you know and I don't", "05:18", "know how it all is going to turn out of", "05:20", "course but I I think that we're having a", "05:23", "chance now and that's why this situation", "05:26", "is so important to me this this",

restaurants", "05:39", "just like anything else that involves", "05:41", "cleanliness this is very important it's", "05:43", "a public service and then for you what's", "05:45", "important is that it protects the", "05:46", "benefits of this service where all the", "05:48", "negative aspects of it are eliminated", "05:50", "with foresight we're thinking about it", "05:52", "in advance and I think that's super", "05:54", "important and I really really commend", "05:56", "you on that and you also have these", "05:58", "really fascinating ideas about how to go", "06:01", "about that I mean your

detailed", "06:11", "stuff yeah we've spent a lot of time", "06:14", "keeping getting better we're just now", "06:16", "finishing up with a whole nother bunch", "06:18", "of stuff too that it's one thing after", "06:20", "the next thing I see when I first", "06:21", "started this is using apart from you", "06:24", "know this or that or whatever there was", "06:26", "like no parts for anything that you were", "06:27", "trying to make and like really try to", "06:29", "figure out how to improvise", "06:31", "whereas now though all of every single", "06:34", "component that we use is made for us we", "06:36", "have very specific providers of all of", "06:39", "this stuff that we've", "06:40", "refined over the years these containers", "06:43", "everything it's all very specific", "06:46", "because there's a an umbilical amount of", "06:49", "problem what's that term bespoke right", "06:53", "the custom made is that what bespoke is", "06:55", "talk I believe that is feasible placate", "06:58", "in the last one no no I will learn", "06:59", "through spoken alone be slow at this one", "07:02", "yeah I'm pretty support that's what it", "07:03", "means made to order yeah right order", "07:06", "right yeah so essentially these parts", "07:08", "and components did not exist until you", "07:10", "came along to design these exactly new", "07:13", "devices for chambers and figured out how", "07:15", "to get them all to work together yeah", "07:16", "it's been you know they give it to go on", "07:19", "you get it off all the electrical I mean", "07:21", "it's been a it's been a it's been fun", "07:23", "you know maybe it's getting like to the", "07:26", "point now - we're glad that we finally", "07:28", "are on the other side of all this stuff", "07:29", "and that it is a valid system that the", "07:33", "system now demands acknowledgement we", "07:38", "put it in there and that they can't say", "07:40", "hey you can't do this here that's that's", "07:43", "not true we could put one of our devices", "07:45", "anywhere and the authorities will allow", "07:48", "it because it's done to code that's why", "07:51", "when these places they're trying to get", "07:53", "through these trouble they're looking", "07:54", "for an exemption or a was the other word", "07:58", "they got variants these different things", "08:03", "they try to get all so it's not a", "08:05", "swimming pool so you don't have to have", "08:06", "any code or whatever these things aren't", "08:09", "cool writing is wins one pools have code", "08:11", "right yeah and because this isn't a pool", "08:14", "doesn't mean it shouldn't have code that", "08:15", "just means it should have a set of codes", "08:17", "that are specifically designed for this", "08:20", "environment which is what this stuff is", "08:21", "here this CCS standard here that we have", "08:24", "you see it so it's all that stuff there", "08:27", "then you read through this and this is", "08:30", "the reality of the direction that the", "08:32", "industry is going in that the", "08:33", "authorities are aware and and then", "08:35", "they're not stupid they understand what", "08:37", "liability is they they can't say hey go", "08:40", "ahead it's okay we don't care they can't", "08:42", "turn a blind eye on this anymore because", "08:44", "it's been brought to their attention now", "08:46", "well it's also been brought to their", "08:48", "attention that there's a lot going on", "08:50", "right now where people are being", "08:51", "investigated for for things like the", "08:53", "doctor", "08:54", "stuff we've got all this weight loss", "08:55", "shit that's out there and you know all", "08:57", "the self-help industry like things along", "08:59", "the lines of isolation tanks it could be", "09:01", "incredibly damaging if these things", "09:03", "become as popular as you and I think", "09:05", "they will be and the filtration systems", "09:07", "aren't good and people have nightmare", "09:08", "stories exactly why survive ins it won't", "09:12", "survive survive that's what happen", "09:13", "grossed out by it", "09:14", "yeah the AIDS came out these things were", "09:16", "not except the capable of dealing with", "09:18", "in AIDS even these these uh parasites", "09:22", "like the Cryptosporidium that'll take 10", "09:25", "days in chlorine to deactivate a Giardia", "09:27", "that's that's a new you know a in", "09:31", "chlorine and then bromine and course", "09:32", "these are not effective methods to deal", "09:35", "with well that and that's something that", "09:36", "people are considered for these tanks", "09:38", "chlorine and it's it's it's it's", "09:40", "actually bad for your skin to sit in it", "09:42", "like that it's not it's not healthy for", "09:44", "you like the skin like when you go into", "09:45", "a chlorinated pool and you go into like", "09:47", "a public pool especially that's heavily", "09:48", "corn in it hurts your eyes your vision", "09:51", "at end yes system it is you're breathing", "09:54", "it and when it's breaking down in an", "09:56", "action with these other materials these", "09:58", "methane's in the like I say it's", "10:00", "creating a politically by products then", "10:04", "that need to be eradicated you can't", "10:06", "just keep that's where you go to these", "10:07", "places they said hey how can you", "10:08", "switching that water out of there like", "10:10", "oh you know this guy on that thing with", "10:12", "the Hamiltons oh every four months and", "10:14", "you're going huh so today you're going", "10:17", "to take eight he says it's expensive", "10:18", "don't want to do it expensive so today", "10:20", "we'll take $800 your money and throw it", "10:22", "down a drain but yesterday we just find", "10:25", "it charge somebody come in here and stew", "10:27", "around in that stuff and I mean it isn't", "10:29", "right I mean there should be a", "10:30", "regulatory agency that demands you know", "10:34", "a certain level of cleanliness yeah", "10:36", "absolutely yeah I mean it's important", "10:38", "well it's important too that there's", "10:40", "there's ways that people can avoid the", "10:43", "negative aspects entirely figure that", "10:44", "out do it and don't have fast that don't", "10:46", "put people at risk but as I said before", "10:49", "we're talking about before there's one", "10:50", "things that I wanted to get into what", "10:52", "about like a commercial version of it a", "10:54", "non commercial version of a home version", "10:56", "of it right a version where you know", "10:58", "that's just going to be you using it you", "11:00", "know that you're not going to do", "11:01", "anything stupid you're going to take a", "11:02", "shower before you go in you're not going", "11:04", "to urinate in it you know that it's only", "11:05", "yours like you wouldn't need all that", "11:07", "other extra", "11:08", "jazz if it was only yours correct well", "11:10", "what what we would want to do is make", "11:12", "sure that whatever we build is built to", "11:15", "code mm-hmm", "11:16", "we don't want to put stuff into", "11:18", "circulation that's not code worth a look", "11:21", "if signage to happen to somebody", "11:23", "liability issues like if they if we", "11:26", "cheaped out on something and it made it", "11:28", "and then they you know okay but listen", "11:32", "hold on a second you're saying cheaped", "11:33", "out but i don't necessarily think it's", "11:35", "cheeping out it's only cheeping out if", "11:37", "you don't know what's going to into that", "11:39", "water if you know what's going into that", "11:40", "water because it's only your's it's not", "11:42", "cheeping out at all it's like do you", "11:44", "need to overburden your system do you", "11:46", "need to make it so it's unbelievably", "11:48", "stringent it removes all the path just", "11:50", "no you're not no one's going in there", "11:51", "but you know if it's just you don't you", "11:54", "think that would be that mean I'd not", "11:56", "only that'd be totally acceptable it", "11:57", "would be ethical", "11:59", "so as you tell the people what to do", "12:00", "well I could agree with that you know", "12:03", "the the issue is with us though is that", "12:05", "people they're there they're going to", "12:07", "take that that that system that we said", "12:10", "is for your home and they're going to", "12:12", "put it into a commercial space right but", "12:14", "you know once that these laws and all of", "12:17", "these standards are put into place then", "12:20", "certainly then we might be interested in", "12:22", "saying okay now here's how it could be", "12:24", "done that that would be less effective", "12:29", "say than the commercial version mm-hmm", "12:32", "but first we would have first what we're", "12:34", "we're very diligent about is to", "12:36", "establish these guidelines in the", "12:39", "beginning not to say oh well yeah some", "12:42", "of our stuff does this or that it's like", "12:44", "all of it does it's certified it's it's", "12:48", "perfect as it is now but the rest of it", "12:50", "is like okay we could do that", "12:53", "but it wouldn't be you know what it is", "12:55", "that we've taken so much time and effort", "12:57", "to to get right now we know all the", "13:00", "other components the less expensive ones", "13:03", "let's say right and we could do that", "13:05", "right but what I'm saying is the only", "13:07", "reason why you need all those expensive", "13:09", "components because you're dealing with", "13:10", "more than one human being right if it's", "13:12", "me that's the one human being I'm", "13:14", "completely okay with taking super clean", "13:17", "actions on it yeah it would not be like", "13:20", "I like to have the best", "13:21", "yeah I know but for someone who lives", "13:23", "you know in a modest way and can't", "13:26", "afford spend the massive amount is there", "13:28", "a way like I know that there's this new", "13:29", "thing that they're content yeah what do", "13:31", "you know that well it's a shower curtain", "13:33", "on a on an aluminum frame you know right", "13:36", "uh you know I don't know how they're", "13:38", "gonna keep that stuff from hardening up", "13:40", "there's a lot of things I don't know", "13:42", "about you know no I don't want it like", "13:43", "salt in the water yeah right and now", "13:46", "that I don't know how they're going to", "13:47", "keep that somewhere without getting a", "13:49", "hard I don't know how it's not going to", "13:51", "dissipate out of there you know I", "13:53", "haven't really studied into it but I'm", "13:55", "aware of certain limitations that occur", "13:57", "just in general when you're dealing with", "14:00", "this material right and do you think", "14:01", "that perhaps some of these other designs", "14:03", "are made from people that do not have a", "14:06", "long term history a long time history in", "14:09", "this sort of a business like they don't", "14:11", "understand exactly what's involved what", "14:13", "the like I remember the thing about the", "14:16", "dude who worked for Sumati he had", "14:17", "encountered all the bullshit before he", "14:19", "knew about when engine seized up he knew", "14:21", "the salt content was too high and it", "14:23", "would fuck with the spa engines you", "14:24", "replaced he knew he knew in advance what", "14:27", "it was probably when we talked on the", "14:28", "phone what the issues were yes and he", "14:30", "would come home and fix them so you", "14:31", "think a lot of these folks they're just", "14:33", "sort of getting into tanks now and then", "14:34", "they go hey I got an idea but they're", "14:36", "not foreseeing the potential hazards or", "14:39", "issues that would come from these things", "14:41", "yes some was that a good a good", "14:45", "explanation that that's this or I don't", "14:48", "think that they care that the ones that", "14:50", "I'm aware of some of these guys I don't", "14:52", "know I know because I I tried not to get", "14:55", "involved with these people because we're", "14:57", "on our own page we are trying to get or", "15:00", "not we're not trying we're doing it we", "15:02", "are moving forward in a direction I", "15:06", "understand what I mean you're aware of", "15:08", "these all these little companies that", "15:09", "are coming up and the good thing is that", "15:11", "it's making people aware of tanks like a", "15:14", "Kickstarter you know somebody sent me a", "15:16", "Kickstarter for that that Zen tank thing", "15:18", "and I looked at and I was like yeah I", "15:19", "don't know if I can retweet this I don't", "15:21", "know enough about it I don't know if", "15:22", "it's good if it's bad I don't know if", "15:24", "it's a good idea I made it on that", "15:26", "Google on your computer when you have", "15:28", "the Yahoo", "15:29", "uh-huh search motor or whatever it is", "15:31", "there is it I saw it on the Yahoo it", "15:33", "said Ozen 10 or whatever it's", "15:35", "interesting so it's the public has a", "15:37", "somewhat of a interest in it let's say", "15:39", "that E News is doing a some series on", "15:46", "actors and how they get into a peak", "15:48", "performance or whatever it is like this", "15:50", "and that and they want to include us in", "15:52", "that in that frame of this type of", "15:56", "activities that using

screens that you're", "53:49", "trying to hook up these tanks with this", "53:50", "is the thing that crash was going off", "53:52", "about forever was these screens that", "53:55", "would suspend above the tank and emit", "53:57", "the lowest amount of light possible so", "53:59", "you only saw the image you didn't see", "54:02", "the actual screen itself or the border", "54:04", "itself you just saw the image in front", "54:06", "of you and in that sensory deprivation", "54:08", "state where the only input it was coming", "54:11", "in was what you were catching off the", "54:12", "screen what you were hearing from the", "54:14", "program that your mind would be way more", "54:16", "easily a way more able to absorb the", "54:21", "information it's a trip we after five", "54:24",

"54:33", "that image in that area that it has to", "54:35", "be in with Fort so that that is very", "54:38", "because you know you're laying down", "54:39", "looking at it and one of the first", "54:41", "things that we figured out was because", "54:43", "you're on your back", "54:44", "right is it there so we take it and you", "54:46", "go like this Zoop and you go Boop and as", "54:48", "soon as the screen changes around you're", "54:50", "convinced that you're standing on your", "54:52", "feet and looking forward on your feet at", "54:54", "the screen really oh this is one of the", "54:57", "first things and then there's some other", "54:58", "stuff here that you know that so when", "55:01", "you're lying on your back and you're", "55:02", "watching the video you think you're", "55:04", "standing after you take the video that", "55:06", "you make them but there is no video for", "55:08", "this really it's like mostly your brain", "55:10", "you don't want to see gone with the wind", "55:13", "or you know you get your your whole mind", "55:16", "it just yes patterns or movements or", "55:20", "whatever we've been working with", "55:20", "different stuff as much as we can with", "55:22", "the time we don't have enough time but", "55:24", "we come back we have a we have a", "55:26", "strategy then to start to produce these", "55:28", "programs involved in this system but the", "55:33", "the initial what's occurring there with", "55:38", "that is then you know that's that's the", "55:41", "future you see this what we explain it", "55:43", "though there's a screen that's hovering", "55:45", "over our face uh how when you're laying", "55:48", "on your back and how wide is it it's the", "55:50", "one we have now is 19 inches because the", "55:52", "material required to build it they can't", "55:55", "get it any big now though there's 32", "55:58", "inch screen material I can get it to", "56:00", "make the to make it 32 inches across but", "56:03", "is their size that it's no longer good", "56:06", "because you have to know that blackboard", "56:08", "it's all black so the whole thing is a", "56:10", "screen right it the the the image will", "56:14", "move around within the screen so you", "56:16", "have it all black we're working on", "56:18", "something you know like those tiles hmm", "56:20", "in the bottom so if you're in a dome now", "56:23", "and you're laying them back on your dome", "56:25", "and those tiles are underneath you so", "56:27", "that the bottom is waterproof of course", "56:29", "but you use it lights on the bottom a", "56:32", "projector or whatever you know on the", "56:34", "bottom and in a dome you're laying on", "56:36", "your back and the dome then is all", "56:38", "filled in with screens oh and the bottom", "56:41", "so now you're laying in this thing and", "56:43", "you're flying it through space and a", "56:45", "dumb the upside everywhere you look and", "56:47", "then it flips you over but wait a minute", "56:49", "wait a link you're lying", "56:51", "but you can see you can't see through", "56:52", "the water yeah it's clear as a bell so", "56:55", "the but wouldn't that ruin the whole", "56:58", "idea of a sensory deprivation oh no it's", "57:00", "a whole nother thing light underneath", "57:02", "you see light you're flying but you", "57:04", "can't turn behind you and look behind", "57:05", "you if it's screen everywhere you're", "57:07", "enclosed in it this is riveted here I", "57:09", "don't really want to okay but if you're", "57:11", "lying I'm confused", "57:12", "sorry yeah but you keep interrupting or", "57:14", "if you're lying on your back you're", "57:16", "looking up right what difference does it", "57:17", "make what's behind you you're not going", "57:19", "to see that well you you want to know", "57:20", "that it's not it's something because", "57:22", "then you're flying you're suspended you", "57:24", "look around you're in the air I mean", "57:26", "underneath you is cool too", "57:27", "if you can have the whole thing", "57:29", "encompassed in you Shoji I did wind up", "57:32", "looking up but you can't when you're", "57:34", "lying back like that you don't know", "57:35", "which ways up you down no you would be", "57:37", "it would make you think that you're on", "57:39", "your stomach looking up at what's you", "57:43", "know I mean looking down that what's", "57:45", "actually up you don't your mind is", "57:47", "twisted when it twists you have no", "57:49", "reference right so when you move you in", "57:51", "there you are under the impression", "57:53", "that's the position you're in", "57:54", "well sometimes I don't know where I'm at", "57:56", "when I'm in the tank when I sort of snap", "57:58", "out of it I've never moved I don't even", "58:00", "know where my feet are facing yeah", "58:01", "bottom ever fallen out or anything like", "58:03", "that where you take off any which way or", "58:05", "no yeah you feel like you're flying", "58:06", "through space", "58:07", "see now that kind of stuff is like", "58:09", "freaky you can't tell people about it", "58:10", "cuz they're going alright then well you", "58:13", "do", "58:13", "I think they froze me out because I used", "58:16", "to talk too much about stuff that was", "58:19", "probably froze yo who's they I don't", "58:21", "know who they are", "58:21", "fucking government man Oh area 51 those", "58:24", "guys don't have nothing to do with me", "58:25", "I'm more of a you say but they're", "58:27", "controlling you with chemtrails spraying", "58:29", "in the skies nanobots up there dripping", "58:32", "down that nano stuff now that's a weird", "58:34", "stuff huh we won't go there don't go", "58:36", "there yeah yeah but this other thing I", "58:37", "had to do with audio mostly the audio is", "58:40", "what's the yes in the audio actually met", "58:43", "you had some demonstrations where I made", "58:44", "the water move oh the water is moving", "58:46", "it's a cymatic frequencies we've figured", "58:48", "out how to them to create the patterns", "58:50", "of sound see we're made out of frequency", "58:52", "based material maybe you bro I made a", "58:54", "twisted say yeah yeah exact sex appeal", "58:56", "is there's all the file but we're made", "58:59", "out of frequencies like would even see", "59:01", "based materials everything is it's", "59:03", "moving oh you mean like strings every", "59:05", "the idea of everything moving at a", "59:06", "different vibration matter is comprised", "59:09", "of materials then that are you know", "59:11", "mm-hmm unique like your liver is", "59:13", "different than your your kidney you know", "59:16", "the frequency of the deliver or the", "59:18", "material that the kidneys made out of is", "59:20", "be different so the cells then that", "59:22", "would be used for these purposes with if", "59:26", "you could see what they tell you that", "59:28", "the replication of the cell creates a", "59:30", "depreciated version in other words as", "59:32", "you aging right yes exactly okay well", "59:35", "what if instead of a depreciated version", "59:37", "of the previous one what if you did", "59:39", "better but if you created a cell that", "59:41", "was", "59:41", "better why wouldn't you if you already", "59:44", "understood but happened to do that well", "59:46", "this is going to be a tool we have this", "59:48", "the sensors now see I was talking about", "59:50", "the brain thing the Germans are getting", "59:51", "me with a cap there what's the neuron", "59:53", "the brain thing with a cap that has the", "59:55", "electrodes on it like a swimming cap", "59:57", "well it's not I don't cap no it's got", "60:00", "electrodes on it it's a cap that goes on", "60:02", "your head okay they haven't built it for", "60:04", "me yet but I've discussed it with them", "60:05", "and they understand that they can do it", "60:06", "based on some thing they've done in a", "60:08", "bathtub somewhere but the the sensors", "60:11", "then you see as they're connected to you", "60:13", "you input information see that's the", "60:15", "other things the sensory of of what's", "60:17", "going out and what's going into you and", "60:19", "then monitoring what occurs based on", "60:22", "this input this is what that thing is", "60:25", "all about but you know I don't want to", "60:26", "get too deep in there because it's kind", "60:27", "of like in the future right now and then", "60:29", "so your idea is to combine sound with", "60:32", "images to essentially tune your body to", "60:35", "a different frequency and that could", "60:37", "potentially change the way your body", "60:40", "produces cells absolutely that's a whoa", "60:44", "interesting analogy of the situation but", "60:47", "indeed there's a lot of evidence to you", "60:51", "know a lot of evidence about meditation", "60:53", "in the mind and the effect on the mind", "60:55", "the physical effect on the brain and", "60:56", "that what is meditation it's tuning into", "60:59", "a certain type of frequency atherton", "61:01", "certain type of mindset turning into a", "61:04", "certain mentality tuning into a certain", "61:07", "energy that the mind is is focused on", "61:09", "and that that actually has a profound", "61:11", "effect on the very brain itself that's", "61:14", "pretty interesting stuff a super", "61:15", "interesting this so that makes something", "61:16", "like what you're saying actually viable", "61:19", "oh yeah", "61:20", "know that we have a group of people that", "61:23", "are willing to give us the money for", "61:25", "that you know that's we have the", "61:28", "resources now to complete that you know", "61:30", "in some sort of period of time once we", "61:32", "focus back to it we've been trying to", "61:34", "get this other stuff done so then we", "61:35", "could get back to this stuff but that", "61:37", "technology that we have built and", "61:39", "patented as well is extraordinary and", "61:42", "that that takes this thing to another", "61:44", "level I mean this is what it is and", "61:45", "that's why it's so important as well", "61:47", "these vehicles that we're producing now", "61:49", "not only will they be used for this you", "61:54", "know", "61:55", "stuff that we've been talking about here", "61:56", "in regards to relaxation and so forth", "61:59", "else it will eventually in the future be", "62:02", "used also for you know other health", "62:03", "benefits and learning and
