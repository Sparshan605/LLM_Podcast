thought", "128:53", "it was all horseshit for a long time I", "128:55", "was I was like I was mocking it all for", "128:57", "a long time and then Jeremy corbels", "128:59", "documentary really

"129:44", "he's free and clear but they were", "129:46", "looking for element 115 he thinks", "129:47", "because he had some apparently", "129:50", "and they had done some tests and there's",

a", "130:01", "certain it gives off a certain field", "130:03", "that makes it almost impossible to grab", "130:05", "and touch and this fog is rejected by", "130:08", "this field and what they're saying about", "130:10", "that element is and I'm gonna butcher", "130:12", "this I don't really understand the", "130:14", "science but this this gravity", "130:17", "intensifier this gravity

and you put a massive", "130:38", "bowling ball in the center of the", "130:39", "mattress everything would just go zoom", "130:41", "and Bend around the bowling ball well", "130:44", "that's what

answer to this I always walked", "130:56", "I've heard of that doesn't everything", "130:58", "else get fucked up", "130:59", "like if you're bending space-time", "131:00", "there's everything else just kind of", "131:01", "come closer together and I don't know I", "131:03", "don't know maybe doesn't maybe does", "131:07", "maybe doesn't I don't know maybe it just", "131:09", "does it with whatever's around it and", "131:11", "maybe we don't understand what you know", "131:13", "how spaced we know that gravity bends", "131:16", "things for it bends light that's why you", "131:19", "know when you're looking at the Sun you", "131:21", "can actually see things they can see", "131:24", "things are actually behind the Sun", "131:26", "because it wore the massive gravity of", "131:29", "the Sun because it's so enormous it", "131:31", "actually manipulates light it bends it", "131:34", "so you can see things that are actually", "131:36", "behind it I want to know like if he had", "131:39", "done Neil deGrasse Tyson bunch times", "131:41", "yeah he's fascinating you know and a", "131:43", "skeptic um and he's an interesting", "131:46", "skeptic because he may I mean he saw he",

sale", "135:43", "March 28th March March 2000 Rosen strike", "135:49", "what he did to ouster over his face with", "135:51", "that fucking leaping right hook yeah", "135:52", "when he split his fucking mouth open", "135:55", "that guy is a fucking tank", "135:57", "and what was more impressive than", "135:59", "anything to me in that fight was not", "136:01", "that he knocked him out with the last", "136:02", "ten seconds to go but that he absorbed", "136:04", "all the shots now star hit him with and", "136:06", "he kept pressing forward almost like he", "136:08", "was invulnerable to him I never saw", "136:10", "anybody do that to Alistar he was losing", "136:11", "that fight though I think Alex yeah oh", "136:14", "yes", "136:14", "Alistair was winning that fight for sure",

off", "137:42", "like it was a walk-off home run and and", "137:44", "the ref was like all right like I just", "137:45", "looked at his face was hanging off do", "137:47", "you think they should have stopped it", "137:48", "yes to his cut went like all the way up", "137:51", "to his nose like if if Rosa strike", "137:54", "punched him more it would have probably", "137:55", "fallen off and then
