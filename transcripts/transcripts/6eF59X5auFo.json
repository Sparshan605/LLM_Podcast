weird way to stop a fight to", "57:03", "when a guy's not taking damage he's just", "57:05", "got a leg that's not working properly", "57:07", "well the problem was to you know he", "57:10", "almost he basically called timeout and", "57:12", "asked for the doctors to come in once", "57:13", "you've done that the fights over I think", "57:15", "I think the ref literally thought you", "57:17", "know he should have just called the", "57:18", "fight right your leg was broken or", "57:20", "something like what did it was his", "57:21", "thought process I guess and then and", "57:23", "then the doctors came in and then they", "57:25", "started feeling around and they're like", "57:26", "you know they're like right here I think", "57:27", "his tibias fractured I can feel the bone", "57:29",

just think it makes takedowns much", "85:45", "more difficult when there's not a cage", "85:47", "because you know you're not gonna press", "85:48", "someone against cage just scoop their", "85:50", "legs out from under him you have to get", "85:51", "a legitimate takedown like an open area", "85:53", "takedown and it makes getting up much", "85:55", "more difficult yeah when you're when",
