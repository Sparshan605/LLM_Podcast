my", "41:21", "disposal I have a fuck I have earphones", "41:23", "on with a microphone and I could press", "41:24", "the truck I go can I see that again and", "41:26", "they'll show it to me on the B screen my", "41:28", "guys his ankle broke and so the", "41:30", "production like sometimes during a fight", "41:31", "will tell him hey Joe we got the head", "41:33", "but it was a headbutt that caused that", "41:34", "cut and then I'll say okay I'm just", "41:36", "hearing from the truck now that it was a", "41:38", "head but we're gonna show you that as", "41:39", "soon as we can but I'm watching it on", "41:40", "that screen right there why can't the", "41:42", "judges get that how long ago did that", "41:44", "change that seems like that should have", "41:45", "been Dave 1 it wasn't that long ago Wow", "41:48", "I don't think the judges have access to", "41:49", "replays though they can't call up a", "41:51", "replay like I can why not shouldn't be", "41:54", "able should be able to they'd have a", "41:55", "little bit too much time to judge or", "41:56", "think about it or", "41:57", "you need to know things you need to know", "41:58", "things like if a guy gets kicked in the", "42:00", "balls was that a real kick in the balls", "42:01", "watch after the after the fact because", "42:03", "I've said you don't want their attention", "42:04", "taken from what's going the action", "42:06", "depends stop and watch the replay", "42:08", "depends yeah I mean I think it should", "42:11", "just be an option for something's up", "42:13", "like what happened there did he get", "42:15", "rocked or did he fall on his ankle you", "42:18", "know I'm saying like what happened there", "42:19", "and there's only one way to tell", "42:21", "sometimes you got to see it again", "42:22", "cut see that again please they should be", "42:24", "able to say can I see that again please", "42:25", "how's that yeah well they they have", "42:28", "instant replays now which is interesting", "42:30", "like say if a guy pokes the guy in the", "42:31", "eye and the judge wants to call for an", "42:33", "instant replay", "42:34", "but once they Institute the instant", "42:37", "replay in some states the fight is over", "42:38", "that's so crazy that doesn't make any", "42:41", "sense so if I say no instant replay just", "42:43", "take this I poke and keep fighting", "42:44", "that's okay but if you want to look at", "42:47", "it on video the fights over what that's", "42:49", "why I compared to the NBA which I", "42:51", "watched a lot they go to the replay a", "42:52", "lot which is a little annoying as a", "42:54", "viewer but they're they're trying to get", "42:55", "it right which they have a team of", "42:57", "people in New York where they're", "42:59", "watching all of all the angles they can", "43:01", "pull up anything they want mm they can", "43:02", "see anything that they take as much time", "43:04", "as they need to sometimes it takes five", "43:05", "minutes but why not do that with", "43:07", "fighting they get it right you know", "43:08", "everyone sense why doesn't that exist it", "43:11", "should definitely exist and I mean we", "43:13", "talked about it with Michael Chandler", "43:14", "yesterday that there should be more", "43:15", "judges it definitely shouldn't be only", "43:17", "three judges that's it's ridiculous it", "43:19", "doesn't make any sense there's no reason", "43:20", "to limit it to three judges I bet you", "43:23", "would get far more competent far more", "43:26", "knowledgeable judges for free then you", "43:28", "would even if you paid them just pull up", "43:31", "their fucking Twitter account blow their", "43:32", "Twitter account up they'll judge you for", "43:34", "free there's so many MMA fans out there", "43:36", "that would love to judge fights and they", "43:38", "actually understand fighting they really", "43:40", "get it and they love it they're not just", "43:42", "doing it

what the you know they're", "43:50", "doing it because they actually love it", "43:51", "so many people would do it it'll be way", "43:54", "better", "43:54", "you could definitely judge from home too", "43:56", "we could definitely should have I mean", "43:59", "why not have like an online scorecard as", "44:02", "well like why not have that as an option", "44:05", "so the UFC could let everybody know how", "44:07", "bad the judges are I mean", "44:10", "I'm not saying that everybody online is", "44:12", "gonna know what the fuck they're talking", "44:14", "about but enough people online are gonna", "44:16", "know what they're talking about where", "44:17", "it'll balance out so if you had just", "44:19", "like 10 judges and then the online", "44:23", "judges have an online scorecard if you", "44:25", "pay for five pastor what you probably", "44:27", "are willing to have some knowledge on", "44:29", "the support yeah yeah but also if put in", "44:31", "the app to say
