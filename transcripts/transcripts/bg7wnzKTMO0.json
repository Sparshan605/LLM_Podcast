mean I would like to look at", "02:57", "how many people on the Left will attack", "03:01", "others for not being progressive enough", "03:04", "not being left enough so I think it's a", "03:07", "it's a panic right you see this is the", "03:08", "kind of behavior you see in a panic a", "03:10", "moral panic for example and so Helen and", "03:14", "I the third person who worked on the", "03:15", "project with us Helen and I wrote an", "03:17", "essay about a year and a half ago and", "03:19", "talking about how the extremism on both", "03:22", "sides is really the problem and most", "03:23", "people reject it and should fight it", "03:25", "most of us are sensible people in the", "03:27", "middle who hate this in fact data just", "03:28", "came out showing that it's 80% of the", "03:30", "population hate the fringes both sides", "03:33", "yeah so an only 8% are on the left and", "03:36", "12% are on the right of the fringe", "03:38", "however that works out and so we wrote", "03:41", "this thing and we said that what's going", "03:42", "on actually we called it existential", "03:45", "polarization so you have this idea that", "03:48", "everything is an existential crisis so", "03:51", "the the far-right will start with them", "03:53", "sees that if the democrats get power oh", "03:55", "it's open borders the terrorists are", "03:57", "coming in our entire way of life is", "03:59", "going to be destroyed catastrophe", "04:01", "catastrophe", "04:01", "oh no Judith Butler's you mean 95", "04:03", "genders quick stop the Democrats no", "04:07", "matter what and then you have the left", "04:08", "oh my god if they get power that", "04:10", "everything's gonna be racist we're gonna", "04:12", "be beating gays in the snow it's gonna", "04:14", "just be the worst thing that's actually", "04:16", "kind of a joke but it's it's for real", "04:19", "though that they think that the world is", "04:20", "gonna fall apart if the other side gets", "04:22", "power yeah and so when you have that", "04:23", "kind of a situation you have a panic and", "04:25", "you see the slightest bit of a", "04:27", "happening on the other side is just", "04:28", "something to completely freak out about", "04:30", "and then what do you do you say oh well", "04:33", "the only possible recipe to balance the", "04:35", "scale is to turn further our way if we", "04:37", "go toward the middle that puts the", "04:38", "balance say if the right goes really far", "04:41", "right and we on the Left move toward the", "04:43", "middle now the whole balance has moved", "04:45", "right so the only way to keep the", "04:46", "balance close to the middle is if they", "04:48", "go right we go left right mm-hmm right", "04:51", "then that's gonna keep the balance but", "04:52", "what that actually does is it this is", "04:54", "gonna get nerdy hang on that actually", "04:56", "puts all of the weight on the outsides", "04:58", "and you think about a spinning thing", "05:00", "right it's got centrifugal forces", "05:02", "happening", "05:03", "what's that trying to just kind of rip", "05:04", "the spending thing apart well if you", "05:05", "have all the weight crammed in the", "05:06", "middle it's like a wheel it doesn't come", "05:08", "apart right now imagine if you had like", "05:10", "two billiard balls and you have like", "05:12", "this big long stick and there's two", "05:15", "holes for the billiard bars they don't", "05:16", "go in it like locked in they're just", "05:17", "sitting there you spin that what's gonna", "05:19", "happen there to fly right off right so", "05:21", "if you have all the weight on the", "05:22", "outside you start spinning a thing so", "05:23", "that's like the political conversations", "05:25", "are dynamic it's gonna rip the thing", "05:26", "apart the more weight gets to the", "05:28", "outside so one side going to the fringe", "05:30", "doesn't mean the other side should go to", "05:33", "the fringe that's how you tear a nation", "05:34", "apart and I pass out 230 hits 2:30 in", "05:39", "the morning hits and I'm just uh I'm", "05:41", "just you know I wake up because I hear", "05:43", "the alarm you
