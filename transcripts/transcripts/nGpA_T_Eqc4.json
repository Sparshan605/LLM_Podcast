"03:17", "even looking in the mainstream you find", "03:20", "so many divergent points in you that I", "03:22", "you know I think that's basically a", "03:24", "fiction that there is this mainstream", "03:26", "that has arrived at this consensus and", "03:28", "that there are no alternative ulterior", "03:31", "motives there and that there are no", "03:34", "dogmas that are being perpetuated there", "03:38", "you know I mean I look at the lot of the", "03:41", "geological stuff and realize that there", "03:44", "are many different points of view when", "03:45", "we get talked about the these floods at", "03:48", "the end of the last ice age there are", "03:49", "many divergent points of view there is", "03:51", "what could be considered the mainstream", "03:54", "yet even that has multiple", "03:57", "interpretations and the same with this", "03:59", "the Komet idea you know I mean I don't", "04:02", "know what constitutes the mainstream", "04:04", "there because there have been a group", "04:05", "that has opposed it at every turn but at", "04:07", "the same time the group that accepts the", "04:10", "comet hypothesis has continued to grow", "04:12", "in fact there's even a number of", "04:13", "individuals involved that set out", "04:15", "specifically to disprove it or discredit", "04:18", "it who are now basically on board and it", "04:20", "has grown from being a small handful of", "04:23", "scientists to they're now 63 scientists", "04:26", "from 55", "04:27", "different institutions that are on board", "04:29", "with the idea that something remarkable", "04:31", "happened at the end of the last ice age", "04:34", "it was probably exogenic meaning", "04:36", "something from outside something from", "04:39", "space there's no consensus as to exactly", "04:42", "what that was which would be normal", "04:45", "because if these discoveries are in", "04:47", "their infancy at this point but there's", "04:49", "been an attempt to discredit the idea", "04:51", "simply because that as the evidence has", "04:53", "come in over the last decade it has", "04:55", "evolved in new mysteries have been", "04:58", "opened up as the evidence comes in and", "05:01", "the claim is being made well there's no", "05:03", "consistent interpretation of this", "05:06", "evidence and therefore we've debunked it", "05:08", "yeah that's a really important lesson", "05:11", "for Parenthood like you can't just tell", "05:13", "kids what to do you know like you just", "05:15", "do it because I told you to do it", "05:16", "they're like fuck you I'm gonna be a", "05:17", "hooker protection yeah and that applies", "05:22", "not only to kids think you're on a", "05:24", "percent applies to kids but it applies", "05:25", "to adults as well and that is people", "05:27", "need to understand why they're doing", "05:28", "what they're doing it and you know if I", "05:29", "want you to go take down some building", "05:31", "and capture some bad guy I don't go hey", "05:33", "hey Joe I want you to take down this", "05:35", "building once you pack capsules bad guys", "05:36", "these the guys I want you to take with", "05:37", "you here's the route I want you to take", "05:38", "in here's the methodology I want you to", "05:40", "use for the clearance because then when", "05:41", "I send you to go do that mission it's", "05:43", "not your mission it's my mission I came", "05:45", "up with a plan you didn't so you might", "05:47", "be you might have thought there was a", "05:48", "better way to do it or you might had a", "05:50", "different idea of how to get it done and", "05:51", "now when you go out there and you meet", "05:53", "some kind of resistance whether it's an", "05:54", "obstacle you didn't expect or whether", "05:56", "it's some scenario that you didn't", "05:57", "foresee instead of you trying to", "05:59", "overcome it you just blame me you just", "06:00", "let that jock who came up with a stupid", "06:02", "plan and here we are it's failing forget", "06:04", "it we're going back we're not going to", "06:05", "carry out the mission whereas if I said", "06:07", "hey Joe here's what I want you to do go", "06:10", "figure out the best way to do it and now", "06:12", "you come up with a plan and now you make", "06:14", "up all the methodology of how you're", "06:15", "going to get it done and you decide who", "06:16", "you're going to take with you", "06:17", "now it's your plan you own that plan and", "06:20", "when you go out in the field and you", "06:21", "meet a little resistance guess what you", "06:23", "do you say I'm gonna find a way around", "06:24", "it I'm going to overcome this I'm going", "06:25", "to overcome that obstacle and make it", "06:26", "happen and that's another piece of", "06:28", "leadership and it's the exact same thing", "06:30", "with kids if you tell your kid you know", "06:32", "you will get good grades in school that", "06:35", "means nothing to them but if you explain", "06:36", "to them hey I would love for you to get", "06:39", "good grades and here's why", "06:40", "it's going to", "06:40", "opportunities for you in the future it's", "06:42", "going to allow you to be able to", "06:44", "outsmart people because you have more", "06:45", "knowledge than them and then you're", "06:46", "going to be able to end up making more", "06:48", "money which is actually give you more", "06:49", "freedom in the long run instead of doing", "06:50", "a job that you don't want to do you", "06:52", "explain all those things to a kid it's", "06:54", "going to be a lot more successful than", "06:55", "just do what I told you get good grades", "06:57", "because I said so now when you do these", "06:59", "conferences were when you you speak at", "07:02", "businesses and they bring you in to sort", "07:04", "of have these leadership media what", "07:08", "would you call them yeah their", "07:09", "leadership seminars seminars yeah now", "07:11", "when you have these seminars are these", "07:13", "some of the principles that you discuss", "07:15", "when you talk about absolutely yeah", "07:16", "absolutely because that's another", "07:18", "another big piece of this is that all", "07:20", "this ideas about interacting with human", "07:23", "beings they just don't change like", "07:24", "there's little variance but whether", "07:26", "you're dealing with kids or whether", "07:27", "you're dealing with adults and whether", "07:28", "you're dealing with business people", "07:29", "whether you're dealing with soldiers on", "07:31", "the battlefield the leadership", "07:33", "principles they don't change and", "07:34", "therefore you can whether you're trying", "07:37", "to get people to go out and capture and", "07:39", "kill a bad guy or whether you're trying", "07:40", "to get them to build some product and", "07:43", "sell it the principles of leadership", "07:45", "don't change you're still trying to get", "07:47", "a bunch of totally independent people", "07:50", "right and that's one of the myths we", "07:52", "have to overcome a lot because everyone", "07:53", "thinks oh in the military ones just like", "07:54", "a robot and that's just not true", "07:55", "everybody in the military is free Center", "07:58", "people they're people they're free", "07:59", "thinking people they're going to come up", "08:01", "with our own ideas they're going out", "08:01", "with their own agendas and they're going", "08:02", "to think of ways to do things that they", "08:05", "think are better than yours so you can", "08:06", "have all these independent free thinkers", "08:08", "and you've got to get them on board with", "08:09", "the same plan to you to go out and", "08:12", "execute and so it doesn't matter if", "08:14", "you're on the battlefield on business", "08:15", "that's what that's what you're trying to", "08:16", "get done and the leadership principles", "08:17", "don't change", "08:22", "[Applause]",
