and it got wiped out by some", "02:32", "cataclysmic event", "02:34", "yeah and then we had to rebuild but is", "02:37", "does he", "02:37", "think that we got all of our technology", "02:39", "from other worldly sources or no not", "02:41", "really", "02:42", "doesn't he doesn't graham is much more", "02:44", "in line with", "02:45", "this um this theory that dr robert shock", "02:48", "has been putting forth he", "02:50", "he was one of the weirder ones that i've", "02:51", "had on the podcast first of all because", "02:53", "he's a rock solid geologist", "02:55", "right professor at boston university", "02:57", "like really well established", "02:59", "his credentials are you know they're", "03:02", "they're", "03:02", "as good as it gets and he was saying", "03:04", "that he thinks that there was a mass", "03:06", "coronal ejection somewhere around", "03:09", "12 000 years ago and it was literally", "03:11", "raining lightning all over the world and", "03:14", "decimated the

"03:24", "my bad this is uh they think in the", "03:27", "neighborhood of twelve thousand years", "03:28", "ago they think this is", "03:30", "so this is recent yeah yeah okay yeah", "03:32", "this is what", "03:33", "graham hancock's work indicates as well", "03:35", "see graham hancock and", "03:37", "him were together on the sphinx because", "03:40", "robert shock was the geologist they", "03:42", "brought in to examine the", "03:44", "erosion marks on the uh temple the", "03:46", "sphinx yeah", "03:47", "and his conclusion was that this is the", "03:49", "result of thousands of years of rainfall", "03:52", "right the problem with that was the last", "03:53", "time there was significant rainfall in", "03:55", "the nile valley was 9000 bc", "03:58", "so you'd have to have thousands of years", "04:00", "before that to create these deep", "04:01", "water-based fissures or water-created", "04:04", "fissures so they're saying the sphinx", "04:05", "was there a lot", "04:06", "longer than we imagined yeah so that", "04:08", "coincides with", "04:10", "a lot of these the the people that want", "04:12", "to push back the dates of civilization", "04:15", "what they think is it all points to", "04:17", "something big happening at the end of", "04:19", "the ice age", "04:19", "yeah so something big happening between", "04:21", "12 000 and 10", "04:23", "000 years ago why don't mainstream", "04:25", "scientists just go", "04:26", "now i'm sure there's a reason for this i", "04:28", "think there's a reason that mainstream", "04:30", "thought leaders in any area don't allow", "04:33", "the fringe in", "04:34", "yeah why what's the big thing here with", "04:36", "keeping these guys", "04:38", "is it that they would just have to go", "04:39", "back and relook at every history book", "04:41", "well in the beginning there was nothing", "04:43", "right so when these guys were proposing", "04:44", "this there was very little evidence but", "04:46", "now that evidence is stacking up and", "04:48", "there's all these ancient structures", "04:49", "that they're founding like go beckley", "04:50", "tepee", "04:51", "and turkey yeah yeah they've once they", "04:53", "found that one", "04:54", "and they realized that it was", "04:56", "intentionally covered up", "04:58", "12 000 years ago so this is like this is", "05:01", "undeniable everyone agrees on it yeah", "05:03", "and so then they have to say okay well", "05:04", "then hunter gatherers must have made", "05:06", "this because 12 000 years ago that's all", "05:07", "we had was hunter gatherers but it's", "05:09", "really sophisticated", "05:10", "construction and it's very difficult to", "05:12", "do and they're enormous and they have", "05:14", "three-dimensional animals that are", "05:16", "carved into them yeah which means they", "05:18", "actually had to carve away the outside", "05:20", "to create the animal instead of carving", "05:22", "the animal into the stone yeah they", "05:24", "actually carve the stone out around the", "05:26", "animal", "05:26", "so these animals are like climbing on", "05:28", "the outside of these stone columns it's", "05:29", "really weird stuff", "05:30", "yeah but who the fuck knows i i'm i lean", "05:34", "more towards", "05:35", "cataclysmic disaster because there's so", "05:37", "many of them that we know for sure have", "05:40", "happened", "05:40", "right between the 165 million years ago", "05:43", "in the yucatan", "05:44", "they killed the dinosaurs i was reading", "05:46", "about the ark storm", "05:48", "that's going to

about", "06:15", "like conspiracies and bigfoot yeah", "06:19", "ufos and shit like that it teaches you", "06:21", "how to think a little bit like when i", "06:22", "was a teenager i was smoking weed with", "06:24", "my buddies like", "06:25", "we would you'd have to research these", "06:28", "things", "06:28", "you'd have to cross-reference", "06:29", "information you couldn't just swallow", "06:32", "the narrative you had to literally go", "06:34", "well and then you have to use critical", "06:35", "thinking to go", "06:36", "does this make sense right would this", "06:38", "have happened right", "06:39", "could maybe could lead harvey oswald", "06:42", "that would have", "06:42", "you know would he have acted alone you", "06:44", "know you have to think about all these", "06:45", "things", "06:46", "but i mean i i do think since trump got", "06:49", "elected", "06:49", "conspiracy theorists have been demonized", "06:52", "and nobody talks about it", "06:53", "right there's a little bit well it was", "06:54", "always going on it was even before that", "06:56", "they were being demonized but yeah for", "06:58", "sure", "06:58", "everybody's worried about the

"07:13", "that conspiracy theories got trump", "07:15", "elected", "07:16", "so now it's like cool to hate conspiracy", "07:19", "theorists", "07:20", "or people that are like let's take", "07:22", "another look at this there's so many", "07:23", "factors that got trump", "07:25", "elected right it's a perfect storm of", "07:27", "people getting getting fed up with", "07:29", "political", "07:30", "correctness yeah someone coming along", "07:32", "that's not a politician", "07:34", "yeah you know the system is so rigged", "07:36", "that after a while you're just like", "07:38", "jesus christ", "07:39", "how many more of these fake puppets are", "07:40", "we going to put in office there's i say", "07:42", "this to comics i'm like everybody's done", "07:44", "a show where everybody

what the room wanted the", "07:55", "whole night they wanted somebody to come", "07:57", "up", "07:57", "and just realize how fucked everything", "07:59", "was and how nobody was having a good", "08:01", "time and that's kind of what trump was", "08:03", "yeah trump was the guy that came out and", "08:04", "just rift yeah he went out there with no", "08:06", "material he just went out there

"08:18", "and trying to stab his friend this was", "08:19", "one of the funniest things he was", "08:21", "speaking", "08:22", "and he was giving a stump speech i don't", "08:23", "know where it was i think it was he", "08:25", "wasn't in iowa but he was referencing", "08:27", "iowa", "08:28", "and he's talking about ben carson's book", "08:31", "and that ben carson had admitted to", "08:33", "going after his mother with a hammer and", "08:35", "trying to stab his friend with an", "08:37", "i mean these are these are in and trump", "08:39", "is talking about it", "08:40", "me and my friend were driving uh out of", "08:42", "new york city", "08:43", "we were laughing so hard i said this", "08:45", "guy's", "08:46", "i said he's gonna win i said i'll tell", "08:48", "you why he's gonna win", "08:50", "i cannot stop watching right yes i can't", "08:54", "i am so fixated by the idea that there's", "08:58", "a guy like this", "08:59", "on the national stage and he's saying", "09:02", "whatever", "09:04", "he want there was something intoxicating", "09:06", "about that a lot of the things you were", "09:08", "saying were horrible", "09:09", "but he was saying them and then on the", "09:11", "other side you had hillary clinton who", "09:13", "was just", "09:14", "a scripted or careful", "09:17", "person and i'm like it's just boring", "09:20", "yeah", "09:20", "so to me i'm like sometimes the", "09:22", "entertaining person", "09:24", "wins because you can't take your eyes", "09:26", "off them well in this case for sure", "09:28", "i mean and that it was a perfect you", "09:31", "know", "09:31", "polar opposite between him and her yeah", "09:34", "you know no", "09:35", "no experience versus vast amounts of", "09:37", "experience", "09:38", "right no real experience in the real", "09:41", "world versus", "09:42", "vast amount of experiences yeah i mean", "09:44", "there's a lot going on between the two", "09:46", "of them it was", "09:47", "it was it's it's a bad way", "09:50", "to choose how the world runs", "09:53", "yes it really is it's very bad to look", "09:55", "at candidates and go who's the most", "09:57", "entertaining yeah well it's also a bad", "09:59", "idea to have one person right it's a bad", "10:01", "idea to have this", "10:03", "this same system that was in place back", "10:05", "when there was fucking", "10:06", "you know a thousand people here but i", "10:08", "think we really don't like we have one", "10:10", "person that seems", "10:11", "like we have one figurehead but we have", "10:14", "kind of this permanent political class", "10:15", "of people", "10:16", "yeah a nexus of powerful institutions", "10:19", "where you have career politicians career", "10:21", "diplomats", "10:22", "career military service people that kind", "10:25", "of don't leave", "10:26", "so i think that's one of the reasons", "10:28", "that we haven't changed the system is", "10:30", "because", "10:30", "one person can't ever do that much", "10:34", "even though trump is wild and crazy and", "10:35", "he's done a lot of bad things", "10:37", "i don't think he would be allowed to", "10:40", "deviate", "10:42", "from many of the policies like that his", "10:45", "predecessors", "10:46", "had kind of established i think that", "10:47", "like the american government", "10:49", "and that's why this the term like the", "10:50", "deep state which a lot of people", "10:52", "ridicule it's an undeniably true thing", "10:55", "i mean our policies are not just one guy", "10:59", "gets into office and he goes here's how", "11:00", "it is", "11:01", "right i mean it's the result of a lot of", "11:04", "you know private corporations lobbying", "11:08", "forming all kinds of forming an agenda", "11:10", "in a non-democratic way", "11:11", "you know they're not accountable and a", "11:13", "lot of these you know people that work", "11:15", "at the cia or the fbi the nsa", "11:17", "a lot of them are appointed they're not", "11:18", "elected right we have no oversight", "11:21", "um we have i think it's 22 intelligence", "11:23", "agencies", "11:24", "now it's really that many i mean it's", "11:27", "something absurd how many could you name", "11:29", "fbi cia nsa uh probably dea", "11:34", "dea an intelligence agency i wouldn't", "11:35", "say it's an intelligence enforcement", "11:37", "intelligence capabilities",

excited yeah the", "12:08", "fucking space troops", "12:10", "now we have space space force that's", "12:12", "gonna be good and why not why not a", "12:14", "space force", "12:15", "well eventually right eventually you're", "12:16", "gonna have to have it oh yeah so why not", "12:18", "have it now", "12:19", "we have i don't know what the national", "12:21", "geospatial intelligence thing does",
