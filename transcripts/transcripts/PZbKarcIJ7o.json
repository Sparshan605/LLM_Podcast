["00:00", "hello freak bitches what about the ideas", "00:04", "of the universe is in a constant state", "00:05", "of contraction no it isn't and man and", "00:08", "well I mean don't people think that know", "00:10", "something abandoned something cystal", "00:11", "argue that it's there's a cycle well it", "00:13", "looks nice and they are good I think", "00:16", "most of most people I mean there's some", "00:18", "people arguing for that you know I don't", "00:19", "find that something neat well I think", "00:21", "they're trying to type their ignorance", "00:23", "and something that isn't any more", "00:25", "plausible in the picture that it expands", "00:26", "forever and as far as we can tell the", "00:28", "most likely possibility is that our", "00:29", "universe will expand forever but to make", "00:32", "you a little bit happier it's quite", "00:34", "possible the best pictures that we have", "00:36", "of our of the early universe is that we", "00:39", "actually our universe isn't unique isn't", "00:41", "alone that there are many universes we", "00:43", "call it a multiverse and that at any", "00:46", "instant in time in kind of a cosmic", "00:48", "super time there's always universe being", "00:51", "born so that that multiverse might be", "00:53", "might be infinite and eternal where are", "00:56", "they outside of our universe how's that", "00:58", "impossible", "00:59", "of course it's possible I understand I'm", "01:01", "not questioning it okay no no here's one", "01:04", "line it well first of all the simplest", "01:05", "possibility is that they're outside the", "01:07", "region we can see right for for example", "01:11", "the edges of our visible universe space", "01:13", "is expanding faster away from us than", "01:15", "light because you know we taught you in", "01:18", "school nothing can travel faster than", "01:19", "light you may remember that from right", "01:21", "we lied okay well no you have to parse", "01:24", "it more carefully like a lawyer nothing", "01:26", "can travel through space faster than", "01:28", "light but space can do whatever the hell", "01:30", "it wants so locally as I told you that", "01:33", "radio host ism is at rest they're not", "01:35", "moving and the other end of the galaxy", "01:36", "the other in the visible universe and", "01:38", "we're rest but the space between us is", "01:41", "expanding so that galaxies like a surfer", "01:43", "is being carried away from us faster", "01:45", "than light relative to the water the", "01:47", "surfer isn't moving right but relative", "01:50", "the shore the surfer is right right okay", "01:54", "so this this galaxy is not moving", "01:57", "relative to its local surroundings but", "01:59", "its ruling away from us faster than", "02:01", "light and like a surfer and undertow", "02:03", "they can swim really fast in the water", "02:05", "but if the water is moving away from the", "02:06", "shore then let me get back to the shore", "02:08", "right and so that galaxy the light from", "02:11", "that galaxy is traveling through space", "02:12", "at the speed of light", "02:13", "but it's a space in between us and the", "02:15", "galaxies moving faster than light then", "02:17", "the poor light can never make it to us", "02:19", "we call that a horizon Wow", "02:23", "so the space is traveling too far for", "02:26", "the light to reach us", "02:27", "so our best the traffic base is too fast", "02:30", "so this light can't catch up with the", "02:32", "expansion of space and it never gets to", "02:34", "us and that that galaxy disappears from", "02:38", "our causal horizon we call it we'll", "02:41", "never be able to see it we'll never be", "02:43", "able to interact with it we'll never be", "02:44", "okay and it could be that that there are", "02:47", "different regions so far away from us", "02:49", "where space is expanding faster than", "02:52", "light which which have a very different", "02:54", "history than our own so there could be", "02:57", "space could be infinite just our simple", "02:59", "unity space that we know of and love", "03:01", "could be infinite in extent and", "03:04", "different regions of that space had", "03:07", "different histories in some of those", "03:08", "regions everything we can see we know", "03:11", "emerged from a single point okay we can", "03:13", "tell that we can tell that by measuring", "03:15", "the Big Bang expansion of everything we", "03:17", "see and working backwards in the", "03:19", "universe that our visible universe was", "03:21", "once smaller and smaller and smaller if", "03:22", "we go back in time we can actually", "03:23", "follow the laws of physics back to the", "03:25", "earliest moments of the Big Bang until", "03:27", "those laws break down and we can make", "03:28", "predictions about the universe should", "03:30", "look like all those predictions agree", "03:31", "exactly with the observations we make", "03:33", "which tell us that that picture works", "03:35", "but another region if you wish could", "03:37", "have come from a different Big Bang but", "03:39", "is that another universe or is it a part", "03:41", "of the universe now when you see here's", "03:43", "how we've changed and this is semantics", "03:45", "but", "03:45", "non-trivial semantics namely when I was", "03:47", "a kid universe meant every everything", "03:50", "right but we say that's a pretty stupid", "03:52", "definition a better definition is an", "03:54", "operational one universe means that", "03:57", "region of space with which at one time", "04:00", "we could have communicated or one time", "04:03", "in the future even if the futures", "04:05", "infinite we might communicate with", "04:06", "because that describes the region of", "04:10", "space where cause and effect works some", "04:12", "measurable distance yes and so that are", "04:15", "we think of a universe as that region", "04:17", "which could throughout which everything", "04:20", "could affect everything else ultimately", "04:21", "in an infinitely long time and in that", "04:25", "picture universes can be", "04:27", "restricted in size and then other", "04:30", "regions which could never have affected", "04:32", "us and which will never affect us in the", "04:34", "future we call other universes and when", "04:38", "and now there are many different", "04:39", "versions of a multiverse but that's a", "04:41", "simplest version and this picture we", "04:44", "call inflation which you know I talked", "04:47", "to I just did two little clips", "04:48", "associated with the new book of one", "04:51", "force for publisher and one was for big", "04:53", "thing one is a universe in under two", "04:55", "minutes so you can look up online look", "04:57", "for Lawrence Krauss explains the", "04:58", "universe in under two minutes where I", "04:59", "talk about this cosmic expansion and how", "05:01", "it might mean there's a multiverse but", "05:03", "the other is I explain the universe in", "05:05", "terms of this beer bottle that I talked", "05:07", "about to you earlier so you can that's a", "05:09", "video you can watch that but it this", "05:11", "theory of inflation which actually says", "05:13", "our universe could the quality qualities", "05:16", "that we see of our universe can best be", "05:18", "explained if some early time in the", "05:20", "history of the universe when it was a", "05:21", "billionth of a billionth of a billionth", "05:23", "of a billionth of a second old it had a", "05:26", "huge expansion suddenly and increased in", "05:29", "size by 30 orders of magnitude in size", "05:31", "in a billionth of a billionth of a", "05:33", "billionth of a billionth of a second", "05:35", "which is by the way particle physics", "05:38", "suggest is highly plausible even though", "05:40", "okay and then and then and then it would", "05:43", "produce the universe that looks more or", "05:44", "less like we looked like he looked like", "05:45", "and and and it's right now the only", "05:49", "explanation of how that would cause the", "05:51", "universe to look like what it looks like", "05:53", "but the neat thing about inflation is", "05:54", "it's eternal so inflation that puffing", "05:58", "up and it in our universe and then boom", "06:00", "a hot big bang followed it okay so the", "06:02", "region universe universe puffed up by", "06:04", "huge amount and all of that energy which", "06:06", "was stored in empty space got released", "06:08", "like the beer bottle and we got a hot", "06:10", "Big Bang and the rest is history", "06:12", "but that's locally but somewhere else", "06:16", "between us and air space is still", "06:18", "expanding exponentially and faster and", "06:21", "faster and faster and only maybe", "06:23", "somewhere else today boom like an ice", "06:25", "crystal forming boom that that region of", "06:28", "space is suddenly left inflation and", "06:30", "maybe a guilt the gazillion years in the", "06:32", "future to be another region of space", "06:33", "that's expanding away from it so much", "06:35", "faster than light so we'll never know", "06:36", "about it we're suddenly that region", "06:38", "leaves inflation and boom another hot", "06:40", "big", "06:41", "bang happens and it turns out in each of", "06:42", "those hot big bangs after the inflation", "06:45", "ends depending upon how it ends the laws", "06:48", "of physics could be different in that", "06:49", "universe and that's how we tend to think", "06:51", "it's quite likely that there are many", "06:54", "many separate regions of space and in", "06:57", "fact it's eternal", "06:58", "so such regions are forming eternally", "07:00", "for all time and and and there are hot", "07:02", "big bangs happening in many regions and", "07:04", "the properties of each of those regions", "07:06", "whether they're conducive to forming", "07:08", "galaxies and stars and planets and", "07:11", "people may be different so we could say", "07:14", "logically in that picture that the", "07:16", "reason the universe looks like the way", "07:18", "it does is because we're here to measure", "07:20", "it oh my god we should leave it at that", "07:25", "okay we should close with that that is", "07:27", "the mind blower grind blow it", "07:34", "[Applause]", "07:34", "[Music]", "07:35", "[Applause]", "English (auto-generated)"]
