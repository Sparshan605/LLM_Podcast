would", "25:29", "make fun of prisoners would make license", "25:31", "plates like it was like a see in movies", "25:33", "like yeah you gotta go make license", "25:34", "plates like that's what happened you", "25:36", "know they'd put the cuffs on them", "25:38", "you know yeah now you'll be making", "25:39", "license plates you know some reason like", "25:42", "being in prison was associated with", "25:44", "making license plates there's and", "25:46", "there's some just just cuz you brought", "25:48", "up prisons there's a pivot here but", "25:50", "there's some creepy stuff going on in", "25:52", "terms of the labor that they're getting", "25:54", "from prisoners oh fuck yeah we were just", "25:56", "talking about that with the fires that", "25:57", "they were paying those guys a dollar a", "26:00", "day to risk their life in the Santa", "26:01", "Barbara fires fuck man how is that", "26:04", "allowed", "26:05", "hey maybe give me a month off you know", "26:08",

give", "26:23", "you a dollar a day so they make them do", "26:24", "it and then they still have the normal", "26:26", "sentence they don't even reduce it or in", "26:28", "I don't know I wish I did I mean I'm", "26:30", "sure", "26:31", "good behavior reduces sentences I'm sure", "26:33", "that probably does something but the", "26:35", "idea that they could pay you a dollar a", "26:37", "day to fight a fires yeah crazy or a", "26:39", "dollar an hour or whatever the fuck", "26:41", "actual number was the way we do prisons", "26:43", "in general in the u.s. is really weird", "26:45", "because I've so I feel like there's like", "26:48", "the Norwegian way of doing stuff and the", "26:50", "Scandinavian way of doing stuff where", "26:51", "they gear everything towards", "26:52", "rehabilitation to get them back into", "26:54", "society and functioning and in the US I", "26:57", "feel like we don't give you towards", "26:58", "rehabilitation we gear it towards", "27:00", "punishment we're gonna punish you and", "27:02", "you know I think you could there are", "27:05", "fair critiques of the Norwegian system", "27:07", "like you know in Scandinavia who's the", "27:09", "guy Anders Breivik he killed all these", "27:11", "anyone who was complaining because he's", "27:12", "like I only have a ps2 and you guys need", "27:15", "to give me like a newer video game", "27:16", "system so you can look at that and go", "27:18", "listen man you guys are being too", "27:19", "fucking liberal fuck that guy he had", "27:21", "like two rooms that were his sound he", "27:23", "could walk in a fucking courtyard and", "27:24", "shit so I think they're genuine", "27:26", "criticisms of that but at the same time", "27:28", "what's fascinating is they have a", "27:30", "significantly lower recidivism rate than", "27:34", "we do so here if you go to prison it's", "27:36", "very likely that you're gonna end up", "27:38", "back in prison", "27:39", "in those places if you go to prison you", "27:41", "know especially if it's like a lower", "27:42", "level crime they rebuilt you and you get", "27:44", "out you're functioning member of society", "27:45", "yeah so we can learn something from them", "27:48", "in my mind I think there should be some", "27:50", "sort of a middle ground like I think", "27:51", "prison should be used yes in some", "27:53", "instances people need fucking punishment", "27:55", "in some instances of course but we need", "27:57", "to mix that in many instances with a", "27:58", "healthy dose of Rehabilitation as well", "28:00", "so we are I don't know functioning like", "28:03", "an actual society as opposed to jailing", "28:05", "more people in this country than any", "28:07", "other country in the world yeah I don't", "28:08", "necessarily think that punishment by", "28:10", "itself helps anybody I mean if you take", "28:13", "a guy and you lock him in a Cell and", "28:14", "he's in that little tiny cell until his", "28:16", "body stops working and he dies is that", "28:18", "helping anybody I mean who is that", "28:20", "helping so are there some say there are", "28:23", "some situations where I get the idea of", "28:26", "like life in prison without the", "28:27", "possibility but it's yeah I get it too", "28:29", "but I mean why look look a Ted Bundy", "28:33", "character some someone along those lines", "28:35", "just indefensible right some serial", "28:38", "killer psychopath what do you do fucking", "28:41", "kill him just how do you feel about the", "28:44", "death penalty but now I know kill him", "28:46", "just come on man there's not enough time", "28:49", "in the world to fix", "28:50", "Ed Gein or", "28:53", "who was the fucking clown William Casey", "28:56", "the clown guy who killed all those kids", "28:58", "and buried him in his backyard yeah", "29:00", "there are some people that Cleveland", "29:02", "somewhere in Ohio your place buddy there", "29:04", "are some people who are just at the", "29:06", "point you're making is there some people", "29:07", "who are too far gone when I say your", "29:09", "place I'm not talking to you I'm talking", "29:10", "to Jamie four people are just listening", "29:11", "why is he fucking with Kyle and saying", "29:12", "he's involved with the clown just know I", "29:14", "don't mind he not even been Ohio might", "29:17", "have been Pittsburgh somewhere dark and", "29:19", "cloudy", "29:19", "so the point you're making is that there", "29:22", "are people who are too far gone Mike and", "29:24", "I agree with that so but my whole thing", "29:27", "on the death penalty is I've always", "29:28", "thought the idea of it in principle is", "29:30", "something I get like you could point out", "29:32", "all those people who did those horrific", "29:34", "things and like there's no hope of them", "29:35", "rehabilitating and their total monsters", "29:37", "and I say philosophically I have no", "29:40", "problem getting rid of those people", "29:41", "because you're just eliminating a", "29:42", "problem right but in my mind the reason", "29:45", "why I'm not in favor of the death", "29:46", "penalty is because four percent of the", "29:48", "time we get the wrong people right so if", "29:50", "you have a system where you're", "29:52", "guaranteed to kill the wrong people some", "29:54", "percentage of the time then what we're", "29:56", "saying is well we're gonna let the state", "29:58", "murder people four percent of the time", "29:59", "and that's something I just can't have", "30:00", "my tax dollars going towards you know I", "30:02", "meet with you a hundred percent but is", "30:03", "it any better to have those people", "30:04", "locked up in a cage for the rest of", "30:06", "their life to their body stops working", "30:07", "well I guess the idea is if you have", "30:10", "them locked up and you have people like", "30:12", "the Innocence Project working on trying", "30:14", "to overturn cases where there was a", "30:15", "wrong conviction then eventually you can", "30:18", "write the wrong of getting those wrong", "30:20", "people four percent of the time but it's", "30:22", "finite if you say no you're gonna we're", "30:24", "gonna put you on death row and you're", "30:26", "gonna die in eight years or whatever it", "30:27", "is then you know sometimes you can't", "30:29", "finish the case in time to overturn it", "30:31", "and mm-hmm so that's my whole thing", "30:33", "about the death like I I agree", "30:34", "philosophically and that's something", "30:36", "many people to my left have come after", "30:37", "me for and said no you're wrong you", "30:40", "should be against the death penalty in", "30:41", "principle but I say no I get it", "30:43", "theoretically and philosophically but", "30:45", "it's just that when you actually", "30:47", "implement it there are pragmatic", "30:49", "problems like you're gonna kill the", "30:50", "wrong fucking people and I'm not okay", "30:51", "with that", "30:51", "you know I mean I don't know if it's", "30:53", "better to kill the wrong people or to", "30:55", "keep the wrong people locked in a cage", "30:56", "suffering for the rest of their life who", "30:58", "where did where did uh William Gacy live", "31:00", "John Wayne Gacy was John Wayne", "31:02", "Chicago Chicago his middle name

fucked up", "31:13", "yeah well we were talking about", "31:15", "something before the podcast and I think", "31:19", "this is I think this is really the", "31:22", "future whether it's in our lifetimes or", "31:23", "our children's lifetimes but I think", "31:25", "that they're going to be able to read", "31:26", "minds and I think it's not we're not far", "31:28", "away from that we're

a", "88:39", "point where maybe you're examining these", "88:41", "things like sometimes you'll think about", "88:43", "these various factors and you get very", "88:44", "uncomfortable and some in
