the", "23:44", "composure yeah I was logged in he's just", "23:46", "so efficient too and he knew that Connor", "23:48", "was gonna fade because Connor was", "23:49", "relying so much on explosiveness and", "23:51", "tents and so down there I thought Connor", "23:57", "did a good job of suggestions flowy and", "23:59", "everything but here's here's the truth", "24:01", "it's like if I were to take a pretty", "24:05", "good high school wrestler or like even", "24:07", "like a really good high school wrestler", "24:08", "and put him against an Olympic gold", "24:12", "medalist like like a high

other guy will be able", "24:32", "to to isolate then I think that's what", "24:35", "happened with with fight and I figured", "24:38", "that would happen I just didn't think", "24:39", "that Connor would do that well the whole", "24:41", "fight until it happened you know he was", "24:43", "doing awesome", "24:43", "it makes me wonder like how would he", "24:45", "have done if he had six months to", "24:47", "prepare how good would he have done if", "24:49", "he got in good shape he might have been", "24:52", "able to make it to the twelfth round I", "24:53", "think either way the the more loose", "24:56", "Floyd got the more he was gonna start", "24:58", "landing shots he's just a far better", "24:59", "boxer he's a specialist you know I don't", "25:02", "think it was I don't think it would be", "25:04", "it's about getting in shape necessarily", "25:06", "because Connor had to be an amazing", "25:08", "shape he's already a world champion then", "25:10", "he's got this big opportunity that's", "25:12", "what I always tell the guys also it", "25:14", "doesn't matter what kind of shape you're", "25:15", "in", "25:16", "being a shape only means you can do more", "25:19", "until you get tired hmm I think the", "25:22", "better shape you're in he would kept", "25:23", "doing more doing more doing more and if", "25:25", "he wasn't able to finish him you know", "25:27", "what I mean like because Floyd was", "25:28", "letting him do more when I mean wasn't", "25:30", "letting him he was wasn't letting him", "25:32", "necessarily but who's taking rounds off", "25:34", "for sure Conor blow out some energy so", "25:37", "it's it's like the better shape you're", "25:39", "in the more you're gonna output until", "25:41", "you get tired but if you're trying to", "25:42", "fucking win you're gonna be you know", "25:44", "you're gonna be putting it out putting", "25:47", "it out putting out I think he would have", "25:48", "been able to do more until he got tired", "25:50", "but the fatigue would have set in we", "25:52", "either way we had this in our wrestling", "25:54", "room the board saying it was a teak", "25:56", "makes cowards of us all ya know I read", "25:58", "that I was like I just I was in the same", "26:00", "restroom since I was five years old all", "26:01", "the way up until you know sophomore year", "26:03", "I was junior your nose

go so hard I know", "26:14", "how to wrestle really I just would go go", "26:16", "go go and just keep scrambling out of", "26:18", "things and that's how I always dress", "26:19", "well and my brother was like the same", "26:22", "exact way he was a grinder old-school", "26:23", "wrestler and you know I didn't push me", "26:25", "so it was always that fatigue you know", "26:27", "fatigue

"26:41", "the fifth round shit I didn't know how I", "26:44", "prepared for that and believe that's the", "26:46", "thing", "26:46", "it's just believing I was tired but I", "26:48", "was having so much fun in there you just", "26:49", "kind of push through that when you're", "26:50", "tired and that's the thing with fatigue", "26:52", "sets in some people can neither wilt", "26:55", "from it or
