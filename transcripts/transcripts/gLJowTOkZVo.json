["00:00", "andrew how are you what's happening man", "00:02", "doing great", "00:03", "nice to meet you nice to meet you really", "00:04", "excited to talk to you about this um", "00:06", "just sort of for an introduction tell", "00:08", "people what you do", "00:09", "so i'm a neuroscientist i'm meaning i'm", "00:11", "a professor of neurobiology and", "00:12", "ophthalmology stanford school medicine", "00:14", "so i run a laboratory i teach a little", "00:16", "bit i teach", "00:17", "neuroanatomy to medical students but", "00:19", "mainly my lab does research so i've got", "00:21", "students in post-docs", "00:22", "and we're trying to figure out the", "00:23", "answers to two problems the first", "00:26", "problem is how to regenerate the damaged", "00:28", "nervous system in particular the", "00:29", "connections between the eye and the", "00:30", "brain", "00:31", "to restore vision to the blind so that's", "00:33", "a big mission of ours", "00:35", "and to prevent vision loss in people", "00:37", "that are losing their vision", "00:38", "and the other thing that we're doing is", "00:39", "we're focusing a lot on stress and other", "00:42", "states of mind", "00:43", "so i'm obsessed with the idea that all", "00:46", "our states of mind come from the brain", "00:48", "and the body and we're trying to figure", "00:49", "out what happens in the brain and body", "00:51", "when we're stressed and how to control", "00:53", "it what happens in the brain and body", "00:55", "when we are creative and how to control", "00:58", "it", "00:58", "and essentially for all states of mind", "01:00", "but rather than try and tackle the", "01:02", "really high level stuff like flow and", "01:05", "states of awe", "01:06", "we're really focused on these states of", "01:07", "stress and things like", "01:09", "focus and the ability to think clearly", "01:12", "and do certain things athletically", "01:14", "or cognitively because", "01:17", "first of all there's a lot of suffering", "01:19", "there are a lot of people out there", "01:19", "they're suffering from an inability to", "01:21", "control their states of mind", "01:22", "and also there's great potential for", "01:24", "people who aren't suffering to be able", "01:26", "to create and perform and do better", "01:28", "things once we can understand how those", "01:29", "states come about", "01:30", "that's an interesting way of putting it", "01:32", "suffering because they can't control", "01:34", "their states of mind", "01:36", "that that is the case but that's not", "01:39", "like a politically correct way of uh", "01:41", "describing it i guess i never thought", "01:43", "about that be accurate", "01:44", "well i think it's fair to say that all", "01:46", "our states of mind", "01:48", "and body and i say mind and body because", "01:49", "the nervous system which is the brain", "01:51", "the spinal cord and all that stuff it", "01:52", "connects to our body", "01:53", "and our body connects to our brains so", "01:55", "we can't really separate those but", "01:56", "states of mind", "01:57", "which include the stuff in our skull and", "01:59", "the body", "02:01", "those essentially dictate our whole life", "02:03", "experience right so whether or not we're", "02:04", "feeling calm", "02:05", "when we want to be calm whether or not", "02:06", "we're feeling stressed when we'd rather", "02:09", "be calm whether or not we are", "02:10", "feeling focused when we need to do work", "02:13", "or whether or not we're feeling creative", "02:14", "when we want to be creative", "02:15", "all of that stems from the nervous", "02:16", "system the other organs of the body are", "02:18", "involved", "02:19", "but the nervous system the brain and", "02:20", "those connections is really what it's", "02:22", "about so if you see somebody who's in a", "02:23", "state of depression", "02:25", "or you see somebody who's in a state of", "02:26", "flow and creativity", "02:28", "you can be pretty sure that that's", "02:29", "reflecting the activity of neurons in", "02:31", "the brain", "02:32", "it's um the idea that the body and the", "02:35", "brain", "02:36", "are inseparable most people who are", "02:39", "physically active", "02:40", "accept that and appreciate that and and", "02:42", "they know that this is probably true", "02:45", "but there's a lot of people that kind of", "02:47", "want to deny that", "02:48", "and concentrate only on the brain and", "02:51", "particularly like there's psychiatrists", "02:53", "that will prescribe medication before", "02:55", "they'll prescribe exercise and", "02:57", "this is uh it's it's a controversial", "02:59", "subject that's what i meant", "03:00", "by saying like that you're you are", "03:04", "unable", "03:05", "to control aspects of of of your brain", "03:08", "or", "03:08", "aspects of the way you're viewing things", "03:11", "the way you feel about things", "03:13", "but yeah so i think um if we take a step", "03:15", "back and we just kind of think about", "03:16", "what the brain and nervous system does", "03:18", "and again nervous system includes all of", "03:19", "it we can say the brain is special right", "03:22", "this brain there is something", "03:23", "fundamentally important about the brain", "03:25", "part", "03:25", "because it somebody who let's say has a", "03:28", "limb amputated", "03:29", "it doesn't fundamentally change who they", "03:30", "are it can change what they can do but", "03:32", "there", "03:33", "and there will be aspects of their", "03:34", "personality and temperament that might", "03:35", "shift", "03:36", "but who they are hasn't changed whereas", "03:37", "if someone has a brain lesion or their", "03:39", "brain is degenerating", "03:41", "that person is fundamentally different", "03:42", "so there is something special about the", "03:44", "real estate in our skulls", "03:46", "but that said the job of the brain", "03:49", "is really to combine our experience of", "03:52", "what's going on in our body with what's", "03:53", "going on in our mind", "03:54", "and to react and behave to things in an", "03:58", "adaptive way so", "03:59", "if i may there's just sort of like if we", "04:01", "take a step back and just think there", "04:02", "are basically five things that the", "04:03", "nervous system is responsible for doing", "04:06", "first is sensation sensation is", "04:08", "non-negotiable", "04:09", "it's happening all the time sound waves", "04:11", "are coming in your feet are in contact", "04:13", "with your shoes or the floor", "04:14", "that's all happening and you can't", "04:16", "control it because we have sensors", "04:18", "things in our eye our tongue our nose", "04:20", "our skin our ears", "04:22", "that take physical events in the", "04:24", "universe", "04:25", "photons of light sound waves touch you", "04:27", "know", "04:28", "physical pressure on the skin and it", "04:30", "transforms that", "04:32", "into one language and the language is", "04:34", "the language of electricity of neurons", "04:37", "now perception is the next thing that", "04:39", "the brain does and", "04:40", "perception is all about which sensations", "04:43", "we are conscious of so if i say", "04:45", "you know the contact of your hands with", "04:46", "the table now you're conscious of it", "04:48", "that's just your perceptual window it's", "04:50", "like a spotlight it just goes straight", "04:52", "to your hands", "04:53", "so there's sensation perception and then", "04:54", "there are these things we call emotions", "04:56", "which are brain body states they tend to", "04:59", "make us either want to get up and move", "05:00", "or stay still they tend to make us think", "05:02", "this is a good place for me to be at", "05:04", "mentally and physically or i want to", "05:05", "shift this", "05:06", "and then there are thoughts which we", "05:08", "could discuss in detail if you want", "05:10", "which kind of arrives spontaneously", "05:12", "they're kind of running in the", "05:12", "background all the time like pop-up", "05:14", "windows on a badly filtered internet", "05:16", "connection", "05:16", "but we can also deliberately have a", "05:18", "thought like i can say", "05:19", "that pad of paper to my right is yellow", "05:21", "i can decide that", "05:23", "in the same way i can do the fifth thing", "05:24", "which is an action so you've got", "05:26", "sensations perceptions", "05:28", "feelings slash emotions thoughts and", "05:30", "actions", "05:31", "and all five of those include", "05:35", "the brain and the body but how much", "05:37", "brain and how much body", "05:39", "is shifted by a kind of underlying let's", "05:42", "just think of it as a tide", "05:43", "like the level of the tide and that's", "05:45", "the autonomic nervous system so if", "05:47", "i'm suddenly stressed for whatever", "05:49", "reason my", "05:50", "perceptual window is going to shift my", "05:52", "eyes are literally going to change their", "05:54", "focus", "05:55", "my world will become more like portrait", "05:56", "mode i'll see you and everything else", "05:58", "will become blurry", "05:59", "when i'm calm i actually have panoramic", "06:00", "vision i can see everything around me", "06:02", "so i better so my state", "06:05", "my internal state of alertness or", "06:07", "sleepiness impacts all this and in sleep", "06:10", "which is kind of the opposite extreme of", "06:12", "stress i'm not in relation to anything", "06:14", "outside me i'm not perceiving anything", "06:16", "i'm sensing things it's non-negotiable", "06:18", "i'm not having real thoughts but the", "06:19", "thoughts are kind of disoriented in", "06:20", "space and time", "06:22", "and behavior is done you're lying down", "06:24", "you're sometimes paralyzed in sleep", "06:26", "so when i say states it's really about", "06:28", "this dynamic shift between", "06:30", "what we're perceiving and how we're", "06:32", "perceiving it and", "06:34", "we could go really in depth in this or", "06:35", "not but states of mind are fundamentally", "06:37", "i think to me anyway are the most", "06:39", "important aspect of", "06:41", "trying to understand how the brain works", "06:42", "because ultimately if you want to", "06:44", "understand mental illness", "06:45", "and mental health if you want to", "06:47", "understand high performance which is", "06:48", "something my lab is really interested in", "06:50", "if you want to understand any of that", "06:52", "you have to understand how these states", "06:53", "of mind", "06:54", "and body relate because the autonomic", "06:56", "nervous system which is", "06:58", "strongly impacting these states is in", "07:00", "the body it it is", "07:02", "the basis of it is connections between", "07:04", "the brain and body", "07:05", "so you're analyzing people in stress", "07:08", "states", "07:09", "and are you doing cognitive function", "07:12", "tests on these people in stress states", "07:13", "versus people", "07:15", "in calm placid states like how are you", "07:18", "how", "07:18", "how are you doing are you doing like", "07:19", "similar tests or", "07:21", "yeah so there are two states that like", "07:23", "we can take that whole", "07:24", "tangle of mess that i just you know", "07:26", "threw out on the table and simplified", "07:28", "and say look there are two states that i", "07:30", "think", "07:30", "if we could really crack we could really", "07:32", "understand the underlying neural", "07:33", "mechanisms and we could understand", "07:35", "how people could get themselves into", "07:36", "these two states we would greatly", "07:38", "improve", "07:39", "human health and human performance", "07:41", "cognitively and physically", "07:42", "okay and those two states are the the", "07:44", "state of sleep", "07:45", "so not just the importance of sleep i", "07:47", "know you had matt on here", "07:48", "so a great sleep researcher not just", "07:52", "that sleep is important but how to get", "07:54", "better at sleeping how to access sleep", "07:56", "so if you", "07:56", "a lot of people struggle with that and", "07:57", "the other state is clear", "07:59", "calm focused those two states for my lab", "08:03", "right now", "08:04", "are the target states but you know", "08:06", "there's so many states but if we can", "08:07", "figure out how", "08:08", "those work and how to put allow people", "08:11", "to put themselves into those states", "08:13", "i think it's my belief that we'll do", "08:16", "humankind a great service", "08:17", "okay so when you say sleep the state of", "08:20", "sleep like what techniques are you", "08:21", "talking about to achieve the state of", "08:23", "sleep or or do a better job", "08:26", "of of sleeping yeah so when people come", "08:28", "into my laboratory", "08:29", "we essentially start pressure testing", "08:30", "them from the moment they walk in the", "08:32", "door so we have a laboratory", "08:33", "we do some animal work we work on mice", "08:35", "and we study states like fear and", "08:37", "courage and", "08:38", "um we're interested in what leads to", "08:41", "winning and certain forms of competition", "08:43", "between animals and these kinds of", "08:44", "things aggression those kind of", "08:45", "very primal states we also have a human", "08:48", "lab so people come into the laboratory", "08:50", "we have an equivalent lab essentially to", "08:52", "our mouse lab people put on vr goggles", "08:55", "we wire them into a lot of gear that", "08:57", "allows us to measure", "08:58", "things like heart rate breathing we're", "09:00", "measuring pupil size", "09:02", "eye tracking and in some people because", "09:04", "they are neurosurgery patients we have", "09:06", "access to the brain we drop", "09:08", "electrodes down into the brain record", "09:10", "from the human amygdala so you have a", "09:11", "hole in their head", "09:12", "they have a hole in their skull the", "09:14", "neurosurgeons actually", "09:15", "uh which i am not uh tell us that you", "09:18", "know it's no big deal", "09:19", "right that that um you know that", "09:20", "basically they look at the skull as kind", "09:22", "of a", "09:22", "poorly evolved device they they always", "09:24", "tell me you know you're much better off", "09:25", "with the", "09:26", "titanium plate there anyway it's much", "09:27", "stronger so they don't have a problem", "09:30", "putting a little hole in the skull these", "09:31", "are", "09:32", "these are patients that have other", "09:33", "issues right so they're saying you're", "09:35", "better off with a titanium plate than", "09:36", "the skull bone well if you're concerned", "09:38", "about concussion or", "09:39", "anything if you really want to protect", "09:40", "the brain you would you know you could", "09:42", "build a better device to protect the", "09:43", "brain but isn't", "09:45", "but isn't the real brain damage comes", "09:48", "from the brain", "09:49", "slamming against the inside wall of the", "09:51", "skull yeah and those are going to be", "09:53", "better with titanium", "09:54", "yeah i mean this is neurosurgeons and", "09:55", "their foam inside the", "09:58", "yeah there are um synthetic materials", "10:00", "that you know they use to protect", "10:02", "against sloshing around do they", "10:04", "how much how far do they go with this do", "10:06", "they ever like remove the top of", "10:07", "someone's head and replace it with", "10:08", "titanium yeah large portions larger", "10:10", "windows", "10:11", "um i've seen windows in the skull that", "10:12", "are you know the size of an iphone", "10:15", "sure you don't flip it open oh no no but", "10:18", "now keep in mind that this is a lid a", "10:20", "manhole cover for your brain", "10:22", "basically really is that available", "10:24", "online can jamie look that up", "10:25", "he's looking at it already well you know", "10:27", "a a guy who used to work in my lab who's", "10:29", "now", "10:30", "who's now at neural link a neurosurgeon", "10:31", "oh one of those guys", "10:33", "that fucking bring on the ai hyperworld", "10:35", "they uh i'm scared", "10:36", "uh among other things i mean i think", "10:38", "that well i always say you know", "10:40", "all of human evolution is based on human", "10:43", "neuroplasticity the ability to learn and", "10:45", "acquire new functions in the nervous", "10:46", "system", "10:47", "or where our biology kind of cliffs off", "10:49", "and can't support us and what we want to", "10:51", "do", "10:51", "we build technology right and this is", "10:53", "the idea innovation", "10:55", "steps in and says i've got an idea to", "10:57", "accelerate this process", "10:59", "and then you get captain super genius", "11:01", "who thinks it's no big deal", "11:02", "cut giant holes in the top of your head", "11:04", "and stick these wires in there", "11:06", "i mean i think there's that version of", "11:08", "it um and i think", "11:09", "what i haven't spoken to them directly", "11:11", "but um except this one individual there", "11:13", "but", "11:14", "you know first of all they're not i", "11:15", "don't think they're thinking about large", "11:16", "windows in the skull unless there's a", "11:18", "clinical need they're talking about", "11:19", "behind the scenes", "11:20", "behind the ear yeah the route in through", "11:22", "the bone there and the other thing is", "11:23", "that i think", "11:24", "it's very likely that the first 10 years", "11:27", "of that work", "11:29", "will be clinical in nature movement", "11:30", "disorders parkinson's", "11:32", "yeah and of course because i said that", "11:33", "they'll probably beat that by you know", "11:35", "five years", "11:35", "well the quote that made me", "11:37", "uncomfortable was when elon told me", "11:39", "you're not gonna have to talk to", "11:40", "communicate anymore", "11:42", "i was like oh jesus christ where are we", "11:44", "going with this", "11:45", "well this is interesting because um so i", "11:47", "have a good friend who's a neurosurgeon", "11:48", "at ucsf we've known", "11:50", "each other since we were a little kid", "11:51", "since we were nine his name is eddie", "11:52", "chang and he's kind of the world expert", "11:54", "he's a neurosurgeon but he's also the", "11:55", "world expert in speech and language", "11:58", "and what he's been doing is decoding", "12:00", "essentially figuring out what neural", "12:01", "signals come out of the brain", "12:02", "that allow us to speak in a certain way", "12:04", "so let's say i i wanted to build a", "12:06", "device that would allow", "12:07", "you to speak eight languages tomorrow", "12:10", "that you don't know today", "12:11", "the reflexive idea is oh that people", "12:15", "like eddie and people like me and maybe", "12:16", "the the neural link folks are gonna go", "12:18", "in", "12:18", "and build chips that are gonna stimulate", "12:20", "the hippocampus and you're gonna learn", "12:21", "faster and do all that", "12:22", "there's a whole other version of this", "12:24", "and it gets right back to this issue of", "12:25", "brain and body that we were talking", "12:26", "about before", "12:28", "now speech is a brain thing you think", "12:30", "about what you want to say", "12:31", "maybe for a joke or hear and and it's in", "12:33", "your head but it's transformed", "12:36", "meaning those nerve signals go in the", "12:38", "form of electricity to the pharynx and", "12:40", "larynx", "12:40", "and you say things like hello my name is", "12:43", "you know in my case andrew right", "12:45", "that transformation is happening at the", "12:47", "muscle so in theory", "12:49", "if i know that in english right and i", "12:52", "know the nerve signals that come out of", "12:54", "that area of", "12:55", "cortex that speech area that say hello", "12:57", "my name is andrew", "12:58", "well i can take those look at how it", "13:00", "controls the pharynx and larynx", "13:02", "and insert maybe a little box maybe i", "13:04", "don't even have to put it under the skin", "13:06", "maybe it's a device that i hold so that", "13:08", "when i say hello my name is andrew but i", "13:10", "dial it to", "13:11", "mandarin or french i'll just say and i", "13:14", "can't do this because i don't speak", "13:15", "mandarin or french", "13:16", "hello my name is andrew i'll think that", "13:17", "say it in english in my head", "13:19", "but my pharynx and larynx will say it in", "13:21", "mandarin or french but isn't the problem", "13:23", "with the way", "13:24", "language is structured in different", "13:25", "languages like", "13:27", "just it wouldn't you i'm sure you've", "13:30", "read translations from like russian to", "13:32", "english sure", "13:33", "it's really weird very different our", "13:34", "english to russian is even weirder", "13:36", "sometimes", "13:36", "right so this is really eddie's work but", "13:38", "um because we're such good friends we", "13:39", "talk about this a lot", "13:40", "one of the fundamental discoveries that", "13:42", "he's made and i should just mention all", "13:44", "these neurosurgery patients they have", "13:45", "epilepsy or something else there's a", "13:46", "reason for opening up the skull and", "13:48", "going in there they're not we're not", "13:49", "just", "13:49", "just curious there was a time a couple", "13:51", "decades ago when you could do this kind", "13:53", "of stuff", "13:53", "and there's some very interesting", "13:54", "experiments that came out of that just", "13:56", "because you could decide to study rage", "13:57", "in humans and go in there and start",

right", "20:57", "they talk in a weird way and i i picked", "20:59", "it up", "21:00", "and then one time i heard myself on", "21:01", "television i heard myself talk like that", "21:03", "when i was 19 i was like oh my god i", "21:05", "sound like a fucking", "21:06", "idiot what is wrong with me like because", "21:08", "i had only lived there", "21:10", "at that time for like six years but i", "21:11", "adopted it whole hog", "21:13", "and i was like what's wrong with me like", "21:16", "why am i i wanted to fit in that's what", "21:17", "it was", "21:18", "i moved there when i was 13 and i tried", "21:20", "to fit in and so i had adopted the", "21:22", "speech pattern i didn't realize it until", "21:23", "i heard it", "21:24", "like you know you listen to a tape of", "21:26", "yourself

is a very", "21:49", "interesting subject to me it's very", "21:50", "important to me and there's many", "21:52", "different parts of this that i wanted to", "21:53", "talk to you about", "21:54",

and", "45:33", "then we go through the whole thing and", "45:34", "i'm explaining how we wire people in and", "45:36", "we record from the brain and i said", "45:38", "all right so um who would like

question", "47:01", "and you could do that with brain machine", "47:02", "interface you could do that with", "47:04", "um you can imagine doing that with drugs", "47:06", "or with you know supplementation or", "47:07", "nutrition all of that", "47:09", "but since the nervous system sits at the", "47:11", "foundation of", "47:12", "any of those we start to think about", "47:14", "this problem and", "47:16", "there's actually another element to it", "47:17", "which is the reward pathways involving", "47:19", "dopamine", "47:20", "so you asked about kids like why they", "47:22", "can learn all day long", "47:24", "so their brain is very different but it", "47:26", "still needs some degree of focus and", "47:28", "they still need to get their sleep", "47:29", "they still have to obey those two rules", "47:32", "of this process", "47:34", "but they engage in something else which", "47:36", "is really powerful which", "47:38", "is play a lot of their learning is", "47:40", "through playful exchange especially with", "47:42", "the little kids like in kindergarten", "47:44", "nursery school", "47:45", "and then as they get older the social", "47:46", "dynamics can be kind of harsh but they", "47:48", "can also be really pleasurable and fun", "47:50", "so the molecule dopamine is a really", "47:53", "misunderstood molecule we all make it", "47:55", "from a", "47:56", "location in the back of our brain and", "47:58", "people think of it as like reward like", "48:00", "oh i", "48:00", "got a bunch of money or i you know did a", "48:02", "great performance dopamine is", "48:04", "responsible for that feeling of feeling", "48:06", "great but in addition", "48:09", "dopamine is what's released any time an", "48:11", "animal or human", "48:12", "thinks it's on the right path and that's", "48:15", "very", "48:15", "subjective so this is not and i want to", "48:18", "be really clear that this is", "48:20", "not positive thinking or you know the", "48:22", "secret or telling yourself that you're", "48:24", "performing well even when you're not", "48:25", "right like if you're a rioter and you", "48:27", "break it into a courthouse but you feel", "48:29", "like you're on the right path you're", "48:30", "going to get a release of dopamine heavy", "48:32", "rain even if you're", "48:33", "yeah even if you're committing a crime", "48:35", "and you really probably shouldn't be", "48:36", "doing that", "48:36", "yeah mother nature built these systems", "48:38", "adrenaline acetylcholine dopamine", "48:40", "to be very generic in terms of what can",

just", "48:51", "getting more of that thing", "48:52", "right so dopamine is evoked through", "48:56", "play it's evoked through humor", "48:59", "right if you've ever just been working", "49:01", "like mad or you see this in", "49:03", "you know team guys know this really well", "49:05", "that you know because they tell me", "49:06", "that you can be in the worst situation", "49:08", "and somebody will crack a joke", "49:10", "and all of a sudden it's like you have", "49:13", "energy", "49:13", "now that couldn't have been glycogen", "49:15", "that wasn't because you're ketogenic it", "49:16", "wasn't cause you're whatever", "49:18", "that's neural energy and that neural", "49:20", "energy is dopamine", "49:22", "is that what happens when you hear a", "49:24", "great song and you get pumped up", "49:26", "is that the same thing absolutely and", "49:28", "the reason dopamine is so powerful in", "49:30", "this process", "49:31", "of neural plasticity is that dopamine", "49:33",

"but when you get a and when i say a shot", "49:45", "i mean internal release of dopamine", "49:47", "through humor or through the sense that", "49:48", "you're on the right path let's take the",

starts to timber a little bit", "49:57", "or shuffle a little bit", "49:59", "you gain a chemical advantage and it", "50:01", "comes in two forms", "50:02", "one is it triggers marking of the", "50:05", "synapses that likely will change later", "50:07", "we rarely forget the events associated", "50:09", "with dopamine", "50:10", "for that reason because they signal oh", "50:12", "whatever's happening now that was good", "50:14", "and in addition to that they start", "50:16", "pushing back on the level of", "50:18", "acetylcholine excuse me no adrenaline", "50:20", "in the brain stem and this is crucial", "50:23", "because", "50:24", "there was a study that came out two", "50:26", "years ago not from my group that asked", "50:29", "why do we quit you know if you set you", "50:31", "know 800 or even 500 pounds on the bar", "50:33", "out there i can't lift it", "50:34", "so i'm not talking about that kind of", "50:35", "quitting i'm talking about a long run", "50:37", "why do i quit if i'm not injured", "50:39", "like what actually causes quitting when", "50:41", "do when do we decide that something is", "50:43", "futile", "50:44", "and it turns out that for every bit of",

bit", "51:59", "differently but it could be and i'm", "52:00", "speculating here of course never done", "52:02", "the neurology", "52:03", "but that david has somehow figured out", "52:05", "that the leaning in process for him", "52:07", "is the dopamine trigger like there is a", "52:09", "kind of sicko thing about the way he", "52:11", "talks about it like it's like a", "52:13", "it's a little bit masochistic", "52:16", "and for him maybe it was that way and", "52:18", "it's rooted in his", "52:19", "origin story for other people they find", "52:22", "this", "52:22", "in purpose like that

"53:12", "it was a naming war so scientists are", "53:14", "like they have egos", "53:15", "um some more than others and uh there", "53:18", "was a naming battle", "53:19", "and so if you go to australia they call", "53:21", "it one thing in england they called it", "53:22", "another", "53:23", "basically was two labs discovered the", "53:24", "same thing and it was a pissing", "53:26",

feel", "54:13", "like this plank is", "54:14", "over like it's on the 60th floor of a", "54:17", "building and it", "54:18", "goes out a window and you really do feel", "54:20", "like you're kind of but you know you're", "54:21", "not", "54:21", "right it's a dif there's a difference", "54:23", "right you get a little bit of it but you", "54:25", "don't get the real thing", "54:26", "right like like being in the jungle", "54:29", "and the leaves part and there's a real", "54:31", "tiger in front of you", "54:32", "the feeling that you would get would", "54:34", "probably be", "54:36", "you you probably wouldn't be able to", "54:37", "recreate it with", "54:39", "virtual reality there's some part of", "54:40", "your brain that knows this is bullshit", "54:42", "yeah uh so we have three three", "54:44", "laboratories to explore this one is the", "54:46", "virtual reality and", "54:47", "virtual reality can give you what the", "54:49", "scientists call", "54:50", "presence the sense

challenge we", "55:27", "needed to we need to stress people", "55:30", "and we needed to do it really well for a", "55:32", "lab and if you look historically", "55:34", "the experiments that came

when the", "96:30", "space shuttle exploded we had a panel of", "96:31", "experts now richard feynman was the one", "96:33", "who", "96:34", "was kind of the front runner and he's", "96:35", "the most

is totally weird and for about", "122:16", "two decades this really perplexed", "122:17", "neuroscientists and this was taught in", "122:19", "psychology classes but not neuroscience", "122:20",

brain in real time as", "122:28", "rodents or people are doing these kinds", "122:29", "of things", "122:30", "and so they figured out that", "122:33", "there's a specific area of the frontal",

month", "157:18", "no so there so there is another version", "157:20", "of this where there's a slow release", "157:22", "polymer capsule", "157:24", "that's that's placed into the eye just",

really", "157:48", "fucking my head up the fact that your", "157:50", "eyeballs are", "157:51", "your exposure two pieces of the brain", "157:53", "that is so nuts two pieces of the brain", "157:55",

meaning", "158:03", "two years because i hate the", "158:04", "10 years thing we've been hearing the 10", "158:06", "years thing forever", "158:07", "one is the work of someone that you've", "158:09",

"158:17", "have to tip my hat to him because", "158:19", "he was really first man in in terms of", "158:20", "doing public facing science education", "158:22", "through podcasts and things like that",

point across", "158:38", "so david's not typically known for doing", "158:40", "vision research but he paired up with", "158:42", "another guy", "158:43", "his lab a guy named jigong he at harvard", "158:46", "children's hospital someone i know very", "158:47", "well we worked together on a number of", "158:49", "things", "158:49", "and they took advantage of what are", "158:51", "called these yamanaka factors yamanaka", "158:53", "won the nobel prize", "158:54", "prize for finding these four factors", "158:56", "that could essentially", "158:57", "allow a cell to turn into anything any",

in these cells so david's lab", "159:08", "has combined an anti-cancer gene", "159:10", "i think these these work are still not", "159:12", "published but he's talked about them so", "159:13", "i feel comfortable doing this", "159:14", "suppresses cancer while turning these", "159:16", "cells young again", "159:18", "and at least in mice they see some very", "159:20", "encouraging results so that would be a", "159:22", "sort of one injection kind of thing", "159:23", "where you go in once you get the", "159:24", "injection and then never again", "159:25", "if i did an injection once a month how", "159:28", "long are we talking how many months do i", "159:30", "have to do it for", "159:30", "so the study would probably run for", "159:32", "about six months or", "159:34", "the embedded capsule the cntf caps will", "159:36", "combine with the vr", "159:37", "now you have to put those vr goggles on", "159:38", "for 20 minutes a day", "159:40", "and watch this that's easy you can", "159:41", "listen to music do whatever you want", "159:43", "it's a very passive thing that triggers", "159:44", "activity of these cells", "159:46", "the activity is key because we know that", "159:48", "neurons", "159:49", "you know you hear fire together wire", "159:50", "together and all this other stuff but", "159:52", "the fact of the matter is neurons that", "159:53", "are", "159:54", "quieted even if you cast an arm the", "159:56", "neurons that support movement of that", "159:57", "arm", "159:58", "very quickly start to turn off and", "159:59", "eventually they", "160:01", "can die so keeping neurons active and", "160:04", "alive and healthy", "160:05", "involves keeping them literally active", "160:07", "electrically and so that's what this the", "160:09", "vr component is about", "160:10", "so there's the sinclair kind of turning", "160:13", "back the clock stuff", "160:14", "and then colleagues of mine at stanford", "160:16", "are doing incredible work with", "160:17", "neuroprosthetic prosthesis so little", "160:19", "robotic retinas", "160:21", "as well as stem cells that are injected", "160:23", "into the eye that settle down into your", "160:25", "eye and give you the cells that you've", "160:26", "lost", "160:27", "and we're not quite there with the human", "160:28", "trials yet but there's a group the", "160:30", "retinal", "160:31", "so repair initiative i'm part of this", "160:33", "thing it has a kind of funny name but", "160:34", "it's called the retinal dream team which", "160:35", "is a bunch of people brought together", "160:37", "to to cure blindness to solve blindness", "160:40", "in a particular disease called", "160:42", "neurofibromatosis so there are", "160:44", "dozens of labs working extremely hard on", "160:46", "this problem this is one place where i", "160:48", "can say", "160:49", "there's been tremendous progress in the", "160:50", "last five years there are clinical", "160:52", "trials now for instance the one in my", "160:54", "lab and in two or three years", "160:56", "you're gonna start seeing people who", "160:58", "would normally go blind", "160:59", "you're gonna halt that and you're going", "161:01", "to see people who are completely blind", "161:03", "i think eventually those people will see", "161:05", "again wow yeah", "161:07", "that's intense i have a it's amazing", "161:09", "it's amazing and you know blind people", "161:11", "the mental real the the mental real", "161:13", "estate but like the visual real estate", "161:15", "in the brain gets taken over by other", "161:16", "functions", "161:17", "i um there's this guy dan mancina he's a", "161:20", "skateboarder he's completely blind he's", "161:21", "an amazing guy", "161:23", "and skateboards blind with a cane whoa", "161:25", "rides up to", "161:26", "rides up to curbs and handrails always", "161:28", "on to him kick flips out this kind of", "161:30", "stuff", "161:31", "yeah and and i've talked to him a bunch", "161:34", "of times because he was having some", "161:35", "issues with his sleep because one of the", "161:36", "issues that blind people have is because", "161:38", "light is controlling when to be alert", "161:39", "when to be asleep he was having some", "161:41", "issues with this", "161:42", "so he contacted me we're also in touch", "161:45", "because we're trying to he's trying to", "161:46", "build skate parks for blind kids", "161:47", "so that is right there oh yeah check out", "161:49", "dan wow that's insane", "161:51", "such a beast i mean most people would be", "161:53", "would be afraid to do this", "161:55", "without yeah that's crazy yeah and", "161:58", "what's", "161:58", "what's so great about dan is he also you", "162:01", "know", "162:02", "that is nuts he's in graduate school", "162:05", "he's", "162:05", "i mean he's such a he's tapping things", "162:07", "so he knows where they are but", "162:09", "how does he know the scale of the ramp", "162:11", "or the the pitch of the ramp", "162:12", "he has an internal representation of it", "162:15", "wow wow that's bonkers he's from which", "162:19", "he can see how cool it is there he is", "162:22", "yeah he's uh he teaches blind kids like", "162:25", "what's possible", "162:26", "basically wow cause talk about covet and", "162:28", "being indoors", "162:29", "blind people i spend a lot of time with", "162:30", "blind people because of the visual", "162:31", "restoration stuff", "162:32", "and there are people like dan who are", "162:34", "out there trying to get blind people to", "162:35", "come out of their rooms to get into", "162:36", "society", "162:37", "if you have a dog you're better off", "162:39", "right because the dog you outsource your", "162:41", "vision to the dog", "162:42", "there are now glasses that blind people", "162:44", "can wear and walk down the street and it", "162:46", "communicates with somebody", "162:47", "in a like a dispatcher who says oh you", "162:50", "know what there's someone sketchy", "162:51", "over there to your right you might want", "162:52", "to cross the street and it works really", "162:54", "well but it's very expensive", "162:56", "and of course you privacy is an issue", "162:57", "you get home you start undressing you", "162:59", "know you don't want the person like", "163:00", "looking at you in the mirror right um", "163:02", "you know or maybe people do but that's a", "163:04", "whole different business you know but", "163:05", "but people like dan are amazing and and", "163:08", "i do believe", "163:09", "you know the hope is that people like", "163:10", "dan will eventually see again", "163:12", "um but that's going to require new cells", "163:15", "and actually for him he's going to need", "163:17", "new eyes so dan actually has had", "163:19", "um because he had this coats disease", "163:21", "that led to a nice pigmentosa", "163:23", "he had his eyes removed so whenever", "163:26", "people are like", "163:27", "sometimes you'll see on social media", "163:28", "people will say i don't believe he's", "163:29", "blind it's like", "163:30", "guy doesn't even have eyes yeah so", "163:33", "anyway there's a that's a whole universe", "163:35", "of stuff but if you would like to", "163:36", "explore visual repair and visual", "163:38", "restoration offsetting vision loss more", "163:40", "um be happy to further yeah i would love", "163:42", "to yeah i'll be your guinea pig", "163:44", "let's get the party rolling dude we just", "163:46", "did three hours", "163:47", "oh my that crazy oh
