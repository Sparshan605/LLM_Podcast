not", "05:14", "getting up he knew he wasn't new he knew", "05:17", "he knew when he dropped them he walked", "05:19", "off right away", "05:19", "like he knew he was called the way he", "05:21",

"05:52", "creativity involved and that's something", "05:55", "that I think a lot of people don't", "05:56", "really appreciate 100% sometimes you", "05:58", "have a trainer who kill that creativity", "06:00", "because he tells you look this is how", "06:01", "you fight right and if you go outside of", "06:04", "that mold no no you're reprimanded yeah", "06:06", "so me me if a fighter wants to drop his", "06:08", "head should you drop your hands and a", "06:09", "fighter should you hold them up well it", "06:11", "depends what kind of guy you were if you", "06:12", "got incredible eyes and you see shots", "06:15", "coming from a mile away and you're you", "06:17", "you're successful with your hands down", "06:18", "or one hand down per se let's say then", "06:21", "keep doing it but you gotta that's why I", "06:22", "think sparring is so important because", "06:24", "wanna be spar we actually try it now", "06:26", "we're testing we're testing hey does", "06:27", "this airplane fly or is it gonna crash", "06:29", "and burn", "06:30", "well we better test it in the gym before", "06:32", "we take that out in the arena and find", "06:33", "out it doesn't fly and I always tell", "06:35", "guys look if you're happy if you're", "06:37", "fighting with your hands down show me in", "06:39", "practice that you're successful then", "06:41", "I won't say anything negative I won't", "06:42", "say I won't change your style I'll let", "06:44", "it be but first we have to see that", "06:46", "you're successful because theories is", "06:47", "one thing but then when you get in there", "06:49", "and tried it's a whole other hmm", "06:51", "well Wonder Boy Thompson is an excellent", "06:52", "example of that exactly he fights so", "06:54", "well with his hands down and he is to me", "06:57", "the consummate karate style fighter that", "07:00", "has made the perfect transition to MMA", "07:02", "because he fights so well with his hands", "07:05", "down you don't know where stuff's coming", "07:06", "you don't know whether it's coming up", "07:08", "whether it's coming around whether it's", "07:10", "going straight at you", "07:11", "and you don't see it until you're", "07:13", "looking at his body and these things are", "07:15", "coming up from his hands being down like", "07:18", "this and he's standing sideways you can", "07:20", "take him to the wrong trainer and ruin", "07:21", "him let's say he was really young and he", "07:24", "was forbidden that style hmm because", "07:26", "some trainers do that they forbade a", "07:27", "certain style they forbid a certain type", "07:30", "of maneuver or or or style out", "07:33", "altogether like for instance in the 70s", "07:35", "most trainers would not train a right", "07:37", "hand left hand a boxer they'd switch you", "07:39", "around no no I don't train left-handed", "07:42", "you got to be right you got to convert", "07:43", "you but that's a that's a dex dextra", "07:47", "meant to the fighter because your", "07:49", "trainer is limited and when I only", "07:50", "understands fighting in one way now I'm", "07:52", "gonna limit my fighter it's it's it's", "07:56", "totally wrong in my opinion", "07:57", "what do you think about fighters who say", "07:59", "that even if you're a right-handed", "08:00", "person there's an advantage to fighting", "08:02", "as a southpaw because you have your most", "08:05", "dexterous hand the hand that you have", "08:06", "the most control of is your lead hand", "08:09", "and you're also fighting in this unusual", "08:12", "stance that is only like what is", "08:13", "southpaw is like maybe two out of ten", "08:15", "people something like right right here", "08:16", "in the West yeah yeah if you go to Asia", "08:18", "it's a lot more but is it really yeah", "08:20", "the Asians are more ozawa I think you", "08:22", "know they the wheel of the cars on the", "08:24", "other side and there's stick shift I", "08:27", "don't know if like a left-handed world", "08:28", "almost a lot of things are the other way", "08:30", "around huh", "08:31", "yeah like the driving at the side of the", "08:33", "road the the the drivers on the other", "08:35", "side of the car so I don't know maybe", "08:36", "maybe it affects the way you're", "08:38", "developed but I agree like I think I", "08:41", "always tell fighters try both sides and", "08:43", "see which one you like better I can't", "08:45", "tell you which one you're more", "08:46", "comfortable with maybe one of your eyes", "08:47", "is a stronger so you're like this it's", "08:49", "kind of killing you so you need to be", "08:50", "like that you never know until you test", "08:53", "so I like to let the guys figure it", "08:55", "so when top people tell me do I grab it", "08:57", "like this or like that in some instances", "08:58", "there's a right way in a wrong way for", "09:00", "as far as we know one way is right one", "09:02", "way is wrong and sometimes it doesn't", "09:03", "make a difference I tell guys grab like", "09:05", "you're comfortable because I do it the", "09:07", "way I like to do it I don't do it the", "09:08", "way my trainer showed me so in this", "09:10", "particular instance I say it's a", "09:11", "question of comfort like people freak", "09:13", "out if you grab a key more like this", "09:15", "with your thumb mm-hmm I don't in some", "09:17", "instances I grab the kymaro with my", "09:18", "thumb and some instances I don't mmm so", "09:21", "I just show people both and I say look", "09:22", "at that part it's up to you you", "09:24", "certainly can't finish it by using the", "09:26", "Thunder and and some of this is stronger", "09:28", "with a thumb in some instances yeah", "09:29", "because you have better hand control", "09:30", "sure yeah you know just clamping down on", "09:32", "it you're actually isolating it I mean", "09:34", "some people have just ridiculous grip", "09:37", "with their hands too and that should", "09:39", "play a factor in there as well do you", "09:41", "remember", "09:41", "Semmy Schilt yes so he Scheldt the head", "09:44", "hands they're as big as his table and", "09:46", "he'd grab ahold of guys wrists and they", "09:48", "just fucked like if you were in his", "09:49", "guard he just grabbed your wrist yeah he", "09:51", "did that with faith oh I was like then", "09:55", "and Paige did that with the lima yes", "09:57", "remember that yes mm-hmm", "09:59", "crazy yeah well that's a great fight too", "10:02", "huh Lima that's that's an argument from", "10:05", "me that Lima is one of the arguments", "10:07", "from me where I feel like there's got to", "10:10", "be as a fan I want to see Lima fight the", "10:14", "best 170 pounders in the world so a", "10:16", "co-promotion I know the UFC never wants", "10:18", "to see a co-promotion because that", "10:19", "promotes up pumps up Bellator but right", "10:22", "now Lima especially after he just", "10:24", "decisioned Rory you know and the way he", "10:26", "knocked out Michael Page I mean nobody", "10:28", "nobody's done that to Paige before and", "10:30", "the way he did it like that guy can put", "10:32", "anyone to sleep", "10:33", "can I ask you who did you give around", "10:34", "the 1/2 page versus Lima I thought it", "10:37", "was 50 felt like I was right on in the", "10:39", "middle I'd have to watch it again cuz", "10:41", "all remember was Lima starching him in", "10:43", "Rome well no no I mean when when did it", "10:45", "end around 2 rounds just yeah but he got", "10:48", "hurt right before he knocked him out he", "10:49", "got he got a little wobbled and then he", "10:51", "kind of got his base again I was low", "10:53", "kick boom yeah yeah yeah vicious yo he's", "10:56", "he's so dangerous he's so dangerous and", "10:58", "his low kicks are some of the best", "10:59", "I never seems fight with Rory yeah Jesus", "11:02", "Christ that swelling on his leg did he", "11:05", "say that took like six months before he", "11:06", "could his legs still not the same", "11:08", "I realize it's like it tore some fascist", "11:11", "so if you look at it that's this legs a", "11:13", "little bit like there's like some", "11:14", "hanging soft tissue yeah oh that's like", "11:18", "Pedro his own remember Pedro his own", "11:19", "when he's fighting heavy weight yeah he", "11:21", "would kick guys in the leg and they'd", "11:22", "have this look on their face like what", "11:23", "in the fuck is that yeah yeah yeah", "11:27", "there's levels that's when this the", "11:29", "rematch want to make sure we got to take", "11:31", "that off the table you know yes I look", "11:33", "forward to it to a trilogy match so it's", "11:34", "one-on-one now you know Rory's Roy's had", "11:37", "some conversations where he's talked", "11:38", "about like not fighting yeah you know", "11:41", "what I think he's had some mixed", "11:43", "emotions but I think he's clear he wants", "11:45", "to fight now like there's no question", "11:46", "about I think it was just that moment in", "11:47", "the ring and he was emotional but once", "11:50", "his head clears up but he wants to fight", "11:51", "again like I don't think you could stop", "11:53", "him from fighting like he loves to fight", "11:54", "well he's so good he's so good he'll be", "11:57", "like and well what did you think when he", "11:59", "went up to fight Mousasi I was worried", "12:01", "about that fight I didn't like that", "12:02", "fight I didn't like that fight either", "12:04", "but you know you want to win double gold", "12:06", "you got to take that risk but personally", "12:08", "I'll be I'll be honest with you I don't", "12:09", "think you should fight a champion in his", "12:10", "prime when you're away class below like", "12:13", "when they were asking for BJ Penn versus", "12:15", "George I was like yeah let's do it", "12:16", "George is in his prime right now right", "12:18", "you want to bring a champion and they", "12:19", "got another belt and but I think it was", "12:21", "a bad decision for for BJ like if I was", "12:23", "be just trainer I wouldn't let him do", "12:25", "that like for instance when George when", "12:27", "they want to put him with Anderson Silva", "12:29", "I said look give me a game plan that was", "12:30", "I'm really confident in and then we'll", "12:32", "do it but maybe not when he's at his", "12:34", "prime like it's just so dangerous or not", "12:36", "and I'll tell you why you can win but", "12:38", "then be shorten your career yes because", "12:42", "at that level yeah 15 pounds more is 15", "12:45", "tons more well there's fights that", "12:47", "people win and even if they want like my", "12:50", "position on steep a versus Francis and", "12:52", "Ghana was very similar I mean I know", "12:54", "steep they won that fight but Jesus", "12:56", "Christ Francis and Ghana he scares the", "12:58", "shit out of me man he hits people so", "13:01", "hard when he knocked out Alistair I mean", "13:03", "literally like he saw his soul leave his", "13:05", "body and then steep a survives that", "13:08", "fight but then gets kayoed by DC with", "13:11", "one punch and shortly afterwards and I", "13:14", "mean that's something that I don't want", "13:15", "to take anything away from DC because he", "13:18", "clearly landed that punch it was clearly", "13:20", "a strategy of working in the clinch and", "13:22", "is a beautiful punch and who knows maybe", "13:24", "he lands that beautiful punch in the", "13:25", "rematch and he knocks him out again", "13:27", "maybe it could have happened but it", "13:29", "didn't you know and I wondered how much", "13:31", "of that punch having such a dramatic", "13:33", "effect on steep a who's had an amazing", "13:35", "chin most of his career how much of that", "13:38", "was because of that incredible war that", "13:40", "he had with Francis because the first", "13:42", "round of that was terrifying", "13:44", "it was tariff and the thing is if in", "13:46", "Ghana loses he's gonna lose in a way", "13:49", "that's not so bad but if you lose to in", "13:50", "Ghana it could be the end of your career", "13:52", "yes like you may never be the cents so", "13:55", "did he help DC well for sure you know", "13:57", "it's all cumulative yeah excuse me but", "13:59", "other fighters I mean John Jones helped", "14:01", "music as well but I get what you're", "14:03", "saying and like in Ghana's got the touch", "14:05", "of death like if I was this trainer I", "14:07", "put him in boxing as well like I'd be", "14:09", "looking at boxing fights well you know", "14:10", "he's talking about that well he should", "14:12", "be he has a few fights left on his UFC", "14:14", "deal and apparently his ideas to one day", "14:18", "make his way into boxing which is just a", "14:20", "fantastic guy he's so big he's lifting", "14:23", "weights again apparently just randomly I", "14:26", "ran into his agent at this place called", "14:29", "dreamscape you know a dreamscape no", "14:30", "dreamscape is this cool virtual reality", "14:33", "thing in LA you put on these goggles no", "14:35", "he's a venture and his family in my", "14:37", "family did it together just randomly", "14:39", "just happened to be teamed up together", "14:40", "and we were talking about Francis and he", "14:42", "was saying that Francis wants to", "14:43", "eventually fight as a boxer as a", "14:45", "heavyweight boxer that's his dream and", "14:47", "that right now he's been lifting weights", "14:48", "and he's like well over 270 he's", "14:51", "apparently like to 75 to 79 somewhere in", "14:53", "that range he's but he's got to be", "14:54", "careful with weights cuz weights could", "14:56", "actually make you weaker like if you if", "14:57", "you if you balloon yourself up too far I", "14:59", "can guess you out and later on like you", "15:01", "don't sustain the ability of your power", "15:02", "right there's a right amount of muscle", "15:04", "for each athlete i mean ii just i don't", "15:06", "know i don't agree
