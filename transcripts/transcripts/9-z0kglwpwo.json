well so you're quite right that", "03:46", "recovery from injury is one thing that", "03:49", "doesn't work so well but so are plenty", "03:51", "of other things so whether it's how fast", "03:52",

actually going to", "10:41", "be pretty much the result of maintaining", "10:45", "it there won't be a just even tiny", "10:47", "because that would mean that you are", "10:48", "airing the damage of

do it a little bit", "10:57", "faster than it's being laid down so you", "10:58", "don't really need to think about the", "10:59", "maintaining part however what we need is", "11:02", "we need to be able to repair all of the", "11:04", "types of damage and because the human", "11:06", "body is so very complicated there are of", "11:08", "course a lot of different types of", "11:09", "damage so

"11:28", "difficult types of damage because", "11:30", "basically the easiest ones are being", "11:32", "worked on by other people we have you", "11:34", "see we set ourselves up as an", "11:35", "independent charity we so we're charity", "11:38", "we're a public 501c3 which means that if", "11:41", "someone gives us money they get a tax", "11:42", "break but we're independent which means", "11:45", "that we do not rely on peer-reviewed", "11:47", "government grants or anything like that", "11:48", "we just rely on for that philanthropy", "11:50", "the numbers advantage of that is that",

publications soon so you", "12:25", "know really ambitious high-risk", "12:26", "high-reward stuff just doesn't get done", "12:28", "and so that so we focused on that", "12:30", "because other people can't that make", "12:32", "sense and that's very unfortunate that", "12:34", "that doesn't get done outside of what", "12:37", "you're trying yeah I mean of course this", "12:38", "is a recognized problem yeah and then I", "12:41", "H for example have tried to address it", "12:44", "with Awards with types of grants that", "12:46", "are specifically focused on more", "12:49", "cutting-edge visionary stuff but the", "12:52", "magnitude there is time it's real", "12:54", "tokenism you know it left the 1% of the", "12:55", "NIH budget what's frustrating to you", "12:58", "about the the state of understanding", "13:02", "pair and understanding the the ability", "13:05", "to fix things well I'm not the kind of", "13:09", "guy who gets frustrated very much you", "13:11", "know I'm always a glass half-full kind", "13:13", "of person so for me what matters the", "13:16", "most is the fact that the understanding", "13:19", "that this is what aging is and this is", "13:20", "hard to deal with it has improved so", "13:23", "much over the years", "13:24", "so I started pulling out the idea of", "13:27", "that this was the way to go after ageing", "13:29", "20 years ago before up until then the", "13:32", "only game in town really was we've got", "13:36", "to make the body run more cleanly and", "13:37", "generate this damage more slowly than it", "13:39", "naturally does and that's a very big", "13:42", "conceptual difference right so it's not", "13:45", "surprising that it took me maybe 10", "13:46", "years to really get the damage repair", "13:50", "approach taken properly seriously by my", "13:52", "colleagues in the scientific community", "13:54", "but about 10 years ago it was taken", "13:57", "seriously and in fact over the past", "13:59", "decade people have been periodically", "14:01", "reinventing the idea and you know I", "14:03", "don't necessarily always get as much of", "14:04", "the credit as I probably ought to have", "14:05", "but I don't care about that the main", "14:07", "thing is I don't have to persuade anyone", "14:08", "anymore", "14:08", "people get it that damage repair is at", "14:11", "least if not the way to go at least a", "14:13", "very promising way to go so really what", "14:16", "happens next is convincing people", "14:19", "outside of the community right and", "14:21", "there's been enormous progress as well", "14:23", "so when you and I spoke last five years", "14:24", "ago really that was the end of the story", "14:27", "I pretty much won the scientific", "14:28", "argument but still no one was really", "14:31", "listening and then over the past five", "14:33", "years the huge thing that's happened is", "14:35", "the private sector interests in this has", "14:37", "taken off so investors have been coming", "14:39", "along", "14:39", "typically it's been led by the angel", "14:42", "investor types their seed investors", "14:44", "people who are willing to do really", "14:45", "high-risk high-reward stuff but they", "14:47", "understand that we're getting close", "14:49", "enough that this is the next big thing", "14:51", "that we will actually have bona fide a", "14:54", "genuine

they well because they do a lot", "18:05", "of work basically and they die at a much", "18:08", "more rapid rate than other types of", "18:10", "neuron so we end up all of this with", "18:13", "maybe

you", "22:20", "know it will of that that gives you a", "22:23", "sense of the level of optimism of the", "22:25", "specialist in this area that's very", "22:27", "exciting", "22:27", "so you when you

yeah and", "23:34", "it's yeah I mean but the thing is what", "23:39", "matters is how that number has changed", "23:40", "over the time over time so I first", "23:42", "started giving timeframe predictions", "23:45", "about 1516 years ago and back then I", "23:48", "said 25 years right so it's only come", "23:51", "down by eight years in 16 years we", "23:53", "sounds like bad news right but here are", "23:55", "two pieces of good news first piece of", "23:57", "good news is that it hardly came down at", "23:59", "all for the first than right", "24:01", "yes it was like I would say yeah um five", "24:05", "years ago I was still saying 22 21 years", "24:08", "so it's been it hasn't been hasn't been", "24:11", "slippin any further for a little while", "24:13", "and the reason why I think of speeded up", "24:17", "to parity is because the only thing that", "24:20", "we're slowing it down before was lack of", "24:23", "funding beforehand you know I was always", "24:27", "saying this is how fast the science", "24:29", "allows the problem to be solved but the", "24:33", "science only allows the problem to be", "24:35", "solved if the fans can be done and that", "24:37",

"25:25", "the other thing that we always are up", "25:27", "against is the mindset that people have", "25:31", "got into about aging that they've needed", "25:34", "to get into for all these millennia that", "25:36", "we have been unable to do anything about", "25:38", "it all have any prospect of doing", "25:39", "anything about it anytime soon you know", "25:41", "what are you going to do you've got this", "25:43", "terrible ghastly thing that's going to", "25:44", "happen to you in the distant future and", "25:46", "um you can't do anything about it so", "25:49", "you've got to put it out of your minds", "25:51", "you're not going to spend you don't want", "25:52", "to spend your life being preoccupied by", "25:54", "it so you've got to find somewhere to", "25:55", "like not think about it and get on with", "25:57", "your miserably short life and make the", "25:59", "best of it right and of course the work", "26:01", "the only way one can do that is by", "26:03", "somehow denying

would", "26:23", "be a bad thing that aiding is some kind", "26:24", "of blessing in disguise that's where all", "26:27", "the heat yeah and that's where all this", "26:28", "stuff comes from about oh dear well we", "26:30", "put all the people or how we pay the", "26:31", "pensions or weren't dictators there", "26:33", "forever or will it be boring you know", "26:35", "which I have to spend my whole life", "26:37", "contending with how do you say well hey", "26:39", "get over the dictators living for", "26:40", "everyone well you know last time I", "26:42", "looked dictator was fairly high on the", "26:45", "league table of risky jobs you know of", "26:48", "Aging in the furthermore the ones that", "26:50", "do die of Aging they tend to have", "26:52", "organized their succession in

"27:00", "is so incredibly small to not cure aging", "27:03", "because of dictator seems like the", "27:06", "dumbest idea ever well there you go I", "27:08", "mean but people really you know yes this", "27:11", "is what people do right that will come", "27:12", "up with some reason why aging is a", "27:15", "blessing in disguise and then they will", "27:17", "instantly switch off their brains for", "27:18", "fear of actually coming up with a", "27:20", "refutation of that reason or even yeah", "27:22", "you know because romantic aspects of", "27:24", "Aging and the weird ones right yeah you", "27:27", "know the inevitable like it though it's", "27:29", "fine it's wonderful I'm looking forward", "27:31", "to it it's it's essentially a disease", "27:34", "that we all get yeah I mean I have to be", "27:36", "very careful with the word disease some", "27:38", "people aren't so you've heard David", "27:39", "Sinclair oh yes he's been a great friend", "27:41", "of mine for a lot of years and we've", "27:44", "yeah we have a very similar attitude to", "27:47", "you know authority we don't think much", "27:49", "of it and so we tend to push the", "27:51", "boundaries a bit both of us you know in", "27:52", "different ways", "27:53", "so he actually his view of calling aging", "27:56", "a disease is a bit different from mine", "27:58", "he's more comfortable with it I tend to", "28:00", "feel that the probe there's a problem", "28:03", "with calling aging a disease which is", "28:05", "that it makes it sound like it's", "28:06", "something that could be cured with", "28:07",

"28:19", "repair you can stave off but you have to", "28:21", "do it periodically because the damage is", "28:24", "going to continue to be created and", "28:27", "the reason why that's important is that", "28:29", "it determines what kind of what kind of", "28:34", "medicine we look for a lot of", "28:37", "Alzheimer's research for example in fact", "28:38", "I would say most of Alzheimer's research", "28:40", "has been predicated on this kind of", "28:42", "mistake on the idea that if we can just", "28:45", "cure Outsiders they know so I would say", "28:48", "that actually it's not that the word", "28:51", "disease is used to narrowly and should", "28:54", "be broadened to include aging rather", "28:56", "it's the other way around that the word", "28:58", "disease is used too broadly and should", "29:01", "be narrowed so it's not to include", "29:02", "things like Alzheimer's that are", "29:05", "actually parts of Aging because really", "29:07", "the difference between the progressive", "29:09", "chronic conditions like Alzheimer's that", "29:12", "we call diseases and the ones that we", "29:14", "don't like you know loss of muscle or", "29:16", "declining the immune system or whatever", "29:17", "you know the only difference is", "29:19", "semantics some of them you know there", "29:21", "are both parts of ating just some of", "29:23", "them are ones that we've chosen to give", "29:24", "to thieves like names - what would you", "29:27", "call aging if you don't call it disease", "29:29", "well I call it a medical problem all", "29:31", "right okay that's pretty pure yeah yeah", "29:35", "in terms of potential future treatments", "29:42", "stem cells seem to be very promising", "29:44", "there are there other competing", "29:47", "treatments that you think are equally", "29:49", "promising or yes sure but they're not", "29:51", "competing so um so as I said because", "29:54", "this is a divide-and-conquer problem", "29:55", "with a bunch of different types of", "29:58", "damage all of which we need to fix then", "30:00", "we need to look at the war fixes are", "30:03", "available for each individual type so", "30:05", "what stem cells are there to fix is so", "30:08", "loss where cells are dying and they're", "30:10", "not being automatically replaced in the", "30:12", "body by cell division have you", "30:14", "personally

know of course the way the", "30:26", "nature of Aging is that because it's", "30:28", "progressive and because it's only it", "30:29", "only causes functional decline after a", "30:32", "certain point there's a trade-off that", "30:34", "one always has to keep in mind in terms", "30:35", "of timing of a therapy between how badly", "30:38", "one needs it and", "30:40", "rapidly the quality of the therapy is", "30:41", "improving so you know if I take a", "30:45", "stem-cell therapy now then there's a", "30:48", "chance that'll be bad for me for", "30:49", "whatever reason okay", "30:50", "whereas ten years down the road I will", "30:53", "still I would have needed it for those", "30:55", "ten years today is that the right I may", "30:57", "start to knead it a bit more but they", "31:00", "will it will have benefited from ten", "31:01", "years more of research and refinement so", "31:03", "you're a cautious paycheck oh sure I", "31:06", "mean I don't think anybody wants to be", "31:08", "the first patient I'm in I'll tell you", "31:09", "I'll be the first guy I'm already doing", "31:12", "a bunch of stem cell therapies will do", "31:13", "intravenous stem cell therapies - well", "31:16", "sure but I mean the point is you you", "31:18", "weren't the first to do any of these", "31:19", "I'll for sure right yeah so yes in terms", "31:22", "of other things so synthetics do not", "31:24", "compete with stem cells because in", "31:26", "oolitic for that to do a different thing", "31:27", "to reflects a different type of damage", "31:29", "namely the accumulation of these bad", "31:31", "cells right and then you've got to have", "31:33", "you know cancer therapies you've got to", "31:35", "have therapies that remove molecular", "31:37", "waste products through inside self a", "31:38", "couple of our startup companies have", "31:40", "have doing that you've got a remove", "31:43", "waste products from outside the cells", "31:45", "for example so people of use the immune", "31:46", "system to do that you've got a repair", "31:49", "DNA in in the mitochondria these special", "31:53", "parts of the cell that do the chemistry", "31:54", "of breathing you know there's a bunch of", "31:56", "different things we have to do and", "31:58", "another piece of good news I told you", "32:00", "earlier on that there's been no real", "32:02", "change over the past 20 years and our", "32:04", "understanding of what the problem is", "32:05", "better than that they'll also been no", "32:08", "real need to change our preferred", "32:11", "approaches to each of

particular type", "32:21", "of damage isn't going to work for this", "32:23", "new reason that we didn't know before", "32:24", "therefore we have to start again and", "32:26", "think of a new one that hasn't happened", "32:27", "to either", "32:28", "that's excellent so it's just", "32:29", "essentially refining the procedures", "32:32", "while actually implementing them yes is", "32:35", "this is this something you still truly", "32:39", "enjoy doing I wouldn't say I ever enjoy", "32:42", "doing it yeah really I mean I enjoy life", "32:44", "I enjoy just you know staring at the sky", "32:46", "from my hot tub and it's just that I", "32:49", "want to carry on doing it rather", "32:51", "you know doing instead so almost", "32:54", "investment it's an investment it's also", "32:57", "I mean it's obviously some sort of an", "32:59", "intellectual pursuit epithet I mean some", "33:03", "people view is an intellectual patina I", "33:05", "don't I I really feel you know I've ever", "33:08", "ever since there was a young kid I have", "33:09", "wanted to spend my life making a", "33:12", "difference to the world improving the", "33:13", "quality and of course in this case",

"33:34", "actually happened was that as a teenager", "33:36", "having pretty much decided that this is", "33:38", "what I wanted to do with my life the", "33:40", "first thing I did was I got into", "33:41", "artificial intelligence research and the", "33:43", "reason that happened was because when I", "33:45", "was a teenager I tried my hand at", "33:46", "programming I find that was pretty damn", "33:48", "good at it and I thought well ok I'm one", "33:50", "of the big problems in the world is the", "33:51", "problem of work the fact that people", "33:53", "have to spend so much of their time", "33:54", "doing stuff that they would not do", "33:56", "unless they were being paid for it and", "33:57", "therefore we need more automation so I", "34:00", "work on that because I'm good at it and", "34:02", "I had no reason at that time to believe", "34:03", "that I was gonna be any good at biology", "34:05", "specifically particularly and there were", "34:08", "other people who were particularly good", "34:09", "at biology and I had made the mistake", "34:11", "ins but absolute assumption that", "34:14", "everybody realized that aging was by far", "34:17", "the world's biggest problem and", "34:18", "therefore biologists would be working on", "34:20", "it in grudging away and of course he", "34:21", "didn't hear much but hey it's a really", "34:23", "hard problem so that's not surprise", "34:24", "so it was until my late twenties that I", "34:27", "found out that I was wrong what happened", "34:29", "was that I met and married a biologist", "34:31", "quite anyone actually who was a full", "34:34", "professor at that time at UC San Diego", "34:36", "she was in England on sabbatical and", "34:39", "through her I not only learnt a lot of", "34:41", "biology just by accident you know over", "34:43", "the dinner table but I also found out", "34:45", "gradually that she wasn't interested in", "34:48", "aging I just kind of it hadn't occurred", "34:51", "to me so it didn't come up in", "34:52", "conversation I began to notice that it", "34:54", "wasn't coming up in conversation started", "34:56", "asking questions and she would say", "34:58", "things like you know well I mean like", "34:59", "it's just decay isn't it and I would say", "35:01", "well yeah but so what", "35:04", "and she", "35:05", "well I mean you're not gonna learn any", "35:06", "fundamental truths about the universe", "35:08", "from studying decay and I would say well", "35:11", "that's true yes but but but it's bad for", "35:13", "you and she would say but that's not my", "35:17", "problem", "35:17", "and I would say well it kind of is and", "35:20", "that would be about as far as we would", "35:22", "ever get so eventually I came to terms", "35:24", "with it because it wasn't just her of", "35:25", "course it was all the other biology if I", "35:26", "was meeting as a strange closed", "35:30", "mindedness well you know as I say people", "35:32", "have had to find ways not to think about", "35:34", "it yes and so eventually I thought well", "35:37", "that's just someone do I know I'd say I", "35:39", "better switch fields and I happened to", "35:41", "have inveigled myself into a position", "35:45", "where switching fields was something I", "35:46", "was able to do I had a very undemanding", "35:49", "job at the University of Cambridge doing", "35:51", "bioinformatics which allowed me to do my", "35:55", "artificial intelligence research in my", "35:57", "spare time I was being paid well enough", "35:59", "and you know I had access to university", "36:01", "facilities and all that so all I needed", "36:03", "to do was repurpose my spare time and", "36:05", "you know start paying my way to go to", "36:08", "conferences could of course back then", "36:09", "nobody knew me and I wasn't being", "36:10", "invited and and so I and it went pretty", "36:13", "well", "36:14", "I started doing quite well-received", "36:15", "stuff and so I became quite well", "36:18", "respected in the field very quickly and", "36:21", "for the first five years that was all", "36:23", "that was happening because I was", "36:24", "basically harmless and it was then five", "36:26", "years in in the year 2000 that I had", "36:29", "this kind of Eureka moment that damage", "36:31", "repair with the way to go and started", "36:32", "talking about what the impact could be", "36:34", "and people start to think I had gone", "36:36", "completely crazy and it took a little", "36:38", "while for people to come around so when", "36:42", "you say that at an early age you felt", "36:44", "compelled to try to help people like", "36:46", "whoa what was that", "36:48", "so what actually happened with this it", "36:49", "was all down to my mother's desire for", "36:53", "me to practice the piano you know she", "36:57", "wasn't a particularly good pianist", "36:58", "herself but she wanted me to learn how", "37:00", "to black how about the other and sure", "37:01", "she was she put pressure on me to", "37:03", "practice all the time and I was", "37:04", "resistant but somehow or other my mother", "37:09", "had already instilled in me a sense of", "37:11", "introspection you know a desire to", "37:13", "understand why I thought what I thought", "37:15", "so I actually decided to think about why", "37:18", "I didn't want to play the piano and it", "37:21", "took very little time for me to realize", "37:23", "that the fundamental reason I didn't", "37:25", "want to spend so much time tapping away", "37:27", "on this thing was that the best case an", "37:30", "outcome of this would be that I would", "37:32", "become a good pianist and that was just", "37:35", "not good enough you know we're already", "37:38", "lots of other good pianist so I would", "37:40", "not be you know contributing", "37:42", "significantly to the quality of life of", "37:44", "mankind by becoming just another one an", "37:46", "additional subpoena that's right yeah", "37:48", "and so I thought well I want to be could", "37:50", "have but and of course it was gradual", "37:53", "after that probably eight or nine so", "37:56", "over the next few years I'm gonna say", "37:58", "this general idea that I playing the", "38:01", "piano was a waste of time crystallized", "38:04", "into the understanding you know I could", "38:07", "actually articulate that I wanted to", "38:09", "make a difference to the world and so", "38:11", "that's how I you know by the time I was", "38:13", "fifteen when I thought I programming and", "38:15", "I've just told you the rest that's an", "38:17", "interesting mapping out of your future", "38:19", "you know at nine years old recognizing", "38:22", "you're not going to make a significant", "38:24", "contribution to the world by doing", "38:25", "something that other people have already", "38:27", "done yeah that's right that's a really", "38:29", "interesting way to look at the world", "38:30", "we're nine I have a nine-year-old", "38:32", "daughter I can't imagine her thinking", "38:34", "like that I think when I started um", "38:37", "working actually at this bioinformatics", "38:40", "project that I mentioned I came I had a", "38:44", "lot of exposure to a lot of top-flight", "38:47", "biologists and it turns out that there", "38:50", "were fields that were just fashionable", "38:53", "right and but yeah

something that minimizes", "39:16", "the likelihood that they will have any", "39:17", "impact in other words basically whatever", "39:20", "they whatever they find out they didn't", "39:24", "matter they themselves didn't matter at", "39:26", "all because they could have been hit by", "39:27", "a truck or done something a bit", "39:28", "then someone else would have found out", "39:30", "the exact same thing 10 minutes later so", "39:32", "they were making no difference I never", "39:35", "understood I feel that I understand it", "39:36", "so you've always felt compelled to make", "39:40", "a difference is there something your", "39:41", "mother instilled in you is it something", "39:42", "you just had yeah I don't really think", "39:44", "my mother instilled in me I think the", "39:46", "introspection was and I if you ask me", "39:48", "how she did that I had no idea but but", "39:52", "yeah somehow or other no I don't like", "39:55", "that but no I think we wanting to make a", "39:59", "difference you just intrinsic in me and", "40:01", "it's something that I just realized as a", "40:04", "result of the introspection mmm when you", "40:07", "look back at that now that's got to be", "40:09", "an interesting course where you've", "40:11", "recognized at a very young age that you", "40:14", "wanted to make some sort of a difference", "40:16", "but that knowing that you would have", "40:18", "that epiphany at a young age when it", "40:21", "comes to like being a pianist or doing", "40:23", "something that's going to significantly", "40:24", "impact people that is not a standard", "40:26", "path that many people are gone that's a", "40:30", "it's a very interesting way to set up", "40:32", "your life well I wouldn't say I set my", "40:38", "life up I say I once I had intentions", "40:41", "but if we look at how I got from there", "40:43", "to here enormous enormous amount of it", "40:47", "was just sheer luck mmm right I mean you", "40:49", "know if most people's lives right", "40:51", "exactly so I would say you know I had a", "40:53", "hope I had a you know general you know", "40:56", "aspiration but you know I would say that", "41:03", "I'm just incredibly privileged to have", "41:06", "you know being able to reach the", "41:08", "pinnacle of my chosen field of endeavor", "41:10", "you know hardly anyone can say that yes", "41:12", "no that is you you you're also well you", "41:17", "fit the part - you're a weirdo you know", "41:20", "I mean you know you're a weirdo suddenly", "41:22", "you know I say that with all due respect",

"42:34", "it's a very very long haul but some", "42:37", "people aren't and that doesn't mean that", "42:38", "they are know that I left a serving of", "42:41", "the benefits it's a very strange thing", "42:44", "where people put on intellectual", "42:45", "blinders and they're talking about aging", "42:47", "and dying it is very weird if you had", "42:49", "heated discussions with other", "42:51", "intellectuals about this because I would", "42:53", "imagine over time over time yeah yeah I", "42:56", "mean the whole thing came to me first", "42:57", "when I was a Cambridge actually and as", "43:00", "an undergrad this was some time before", "43:01", "of course so when I was in my first year", "43:06", "probably 1982 they brought in a stage", "43:10", "hypnotist to do a show you ever seen a", "43:12", "safe position yes okay so this guy you", "43:15", "know he's got an audience of a few", "43:17", "hundred people all of us you know can be", "43:19", "undergraduates and so the first step is", "43:23", "you know do some stuff that gets some", "43:27", "particularly amenable people into a", "43:30", "light trance and he brings a few of them", "43:32", "up on stage and starts to go further", "43:35", "right so there was this one particular", "43:37", "part of the show that stuck in my mind", "43:39", "what happened was this one guy was", "43:41", "brought up and got into a but really", "43:42", "really cheap trance and then the next", "43:45", "step was that the hypnotist says okay", "43:48", "this is actually your right elbow and", "43:49", "this is your left elbow so you switch", "43:51", "the guy's elbows right no elaboration of", "43:53", "the continent the implications of this", "43:55", "just", "43:55", "getting the button to completely", "43:57", "completely implicitly believe this thing", "43:59", "right and then he said right I would", "44:02", "like you please to touch your right", "44:05", "elbow with your left forefinger right", "44:08", "and so of course it was all this reeling", "44:09", "and writhing and so on you know couldn't", "44:11", "do it and that was funny in and of", "44:13", "itself but that wasn't the coup de", "44:16", "Grasse what happened next was the key", "44:19", "thing the hypnotist says ok can stop now", "44:22", "and the guy stops and ellipsis and says", "44:25", "he couldn't do it good you and the guy", "44:27", "says now and then let me just says why", "44:31", "not that's the guy to explain why I", "44:34", "couldn't do it and here is the coup de", "44:37", "Grasse because what happens is the guy", "44:38", "gives a completely unhesitating lucid", "44:42", "grammatically correct explanation for", "44:43", "why couldn't do it and the explanation", "44:46", "of course will have a hole in it the", "44:47", "size of Canada but the fact is that I", "44:51", "won't see it he'll just be staying", "44:53", "sitting there with a straight face just", "44:56", "doing this and his friends all right the", "44:58", "user came to undergraduate right high IQ", "45:00", "highly respected each other's intellect", "45:02", "bro for one for their own intellect and", "45:04", "rationality and and they're rolling in", "45:08", "the aisles and the guys is unaffected so", "45:12", "when I started to have these discussions", "45:15", "with people about aging I'm sorry to", "45:17", "find out that people make these", "45:20", "unbelievable arguments in favor of it um", "45:24", "you know I click on this rail I call it", "45:25", "the pro aging trance and it was based on", "45:28", "that experience from my youth yeah I've", "45:31", "always said to people if there was a", "45:33", "pill that you can take that would stop", "45:36", "all aging all deterioration and all", "45:39", "diseases you'd be a fool not to take it", "45:42", "you'd be a fool do you want to suffer", "45:45", "the idea that this romantic look if it", "45:48", "was a rare thing that people aged a very", "45:51", "rare thing we would look at it with", "45:53", "great sadness that someone was afflicted", "45:55", "with this aging we saw someone hunched", "45:58", "over with severe arthritis and", "46:00", "osteoporosis and deterioration of the", "46:03", "joints and decaying of the cognitive", "46:05", "function and they don't know where they", "46:07", "are who they are we'd be so sad", "46:09", "but instead we think of it as like well", "46:11", "he's 90 he had a good life", "46:13", "that's exactly right it's not just the", "46:15", "fact that everyone gets it it's the fact", "46:17", "that everyone gets it I'm more or less", "46:18", "the same a chronological age you know so", "46:22", "it's considered to be this leveler and", "46:23", "Jeff yes absolutely people do a little", "46:25", "bit better you know 20 percent better", "46:27", "than average they were people that were", "46:29", "already you know happy is there any", "46:31", "concern or any thought whatsoever to the", "46:34", "idea of exacerbating overpopulation of", "46:39", "course this is a legitimate question the", "46:42", "thing that's frustrating to me is that", "46:44", "I've been answering it for 20 years", "46:46", "people kill dummies right well of course", "46:52", "a large part of the reason why it's", "46:55", "difficult to get their real answers", "46:56", "across is because so much fiction has", "47:00", "fiction has been written and across", "47:01", "movies giving wrong answers and you know", "47:05", "making a dramatic element out of it yeah", "47:07", "whether it's Blade Runner or in time or", "47:10", "you know any of these movies they all", "47:13", "make it as if in fact they kind of", "47:16", "reinforce the Probation trance right", "47:18", "they make it as if life would be even", "47:19", "worse if we had no aging okay so what's", "47:23", "the real answer the real answer is very", "47:24", "straightforward it's simply that other", "47:26", "technologies that are coming along", "47:28", "already and will be established", "47:30", "well-established and ubiquitous before", "47:32", "we get this to happen are going to solve", "47:35", "the problem because they will increase", "47:37", "the carrying capacity of the planets", "47:39", "remember that the reason why we have too", "47:42", "many people today and we've got", "47:44", "environmental consequences is not", "47:46", "because of lack of space it's because of", "47:49", "the amount of pollution that the average", "47:50", "person generates specifically of course", "47:52", "how biggest thing being

wind energy now that", "48:06", "are completely exploding and they're", "48:08", "going to completely replace fossil fuels", "48:10", "and we got there without people even", "48:14", "having to wake up and realize that", "48:15", "climate change is actually quite an", "48:16", "urgent problem we got there simply", "48:18", "because the technology got to be good", "48:20", "enough that the production of a killer", "48:22", "of of energy is actually cheaper with", "48:25", "the renewable energy mech mechanisms", "48:28", "than it is from fossil fuel of course", "48:30", "not just that

"optimistic perception about the ocean", "49:50", "well first of all let me say well I", "49:53", "think about the word optimism because I", "49:56", "know that you're not doing this but a", "49:57",

that they're a", "50:06", "pessimist", "50:07", "so but but anyway about the ocean of", "50:09", "course I mean what's the difference you", "50:12", "know there's certainly there's a lot to", "50:14", "do one big problem right now of course", "50:16", "is the ocean is storing a lot of carbon", "50:19", "and releasing a lot as its warming up so", "50:22", "we definitely had to fix that as well", "50:23", "but it's part of the same problem you", "50:25", "know the less carbon there is in the", "50:26", "atmosphere the less the less of a", "50:27", "problem that is direct carbon removal",

a lot", "52:07", "of it is also being done by countries", "52:09", "that can't afford to make this", "52:11", "artificial fish or don't have the access", "52:13", "to it or at least in the time

"52:48", "investing more in the development of", "52:50", "these new technologies that will hasten", "52:53", "the ability to and if they won't even", "52:56", "bother with wild fish if they mean if", "52:59", "they can make artificial meat I wonder", "53:01", "if the people really get into artificial", "53:03", "fish as well dr. Ewen oh I guess so but", "53:06", "some of them are not gonna make the cut", "53:07", "like no one's getting artificial tilapia", "53:09", "why not it's not that good well yet so", "53:12", "they've looked at it why didn't even", "53:15", "call it tilapia then but like to cook", "53:17", "people like the night like yes I'm", "53:21", "really optimistic about artificial meat", "53:23", "I mean it seems that they're I mean at", "53:26", "one point time was like a", "53:26", "quarter-million dollars for a hamburger", "53:28", "and now they've got it down to a point", "53:30", "where you can actually make an animal", "53:33", "meat product that does not come from an", "53:37", "animal dying that's right they're very", "53:39", "close to be able to make this in a mass", "53:41", "marketed way that's right that's", "53:43", "interesting", "53:44", "I'm excited about that I think that's", "53:46", "very interesting and I'm excited about", "53:49", "what you're saying that I think people", "53:53", "think about overpopulation one things", "53:55", "that you should take into consideration", "53:57", "is that as populations increase in", "54:00", "places urbanized the actual birth rate", "54:03", "goes down to the point where places like", "54:05", "Japan there's actually concern that", "54:07", "they're not having enough children right", "54:09", "and of course it is driven by prosperity", "54:11", "yeah a male education and emancipation", "54:16", "countries in the world the largest dozen", "54:18", "countries in the world the only one that", "54:21", "has really high 48 still in Nigeria you", "54:25", "know if you exclude sub-saharan Africa", "54:28", "it's basically completely solved a", "54:29", "problem really Nigeria is the only one", "54:33", "yeah if you look at the country you", "54:35", "would not expect like Bangladesh or", "54:36", "Pakistan or India you know their photo", "54:38", "here right it's down below three now", "54:40", "really yeah that's interesting so their", "54:43", "population will level out over the next", "54:45", "few decades", "54:45", "well yeah it's still declining yeah it's", "54:49", "plummeting you know people often used to", "54:50", "say that the only reason why China's", "54:54", "fertility rate is low is because of the", "54:56", "one-child policy which of course they", "54:57", "haven't", "54:57", "continued with oph\u00e9lie because of", "54:59", "problems like this basically I mean", "55:02", "other countries were a little bit behind", "55:03", "the one-child policy did certainly", "55:05", "accelerate the process but if you look", "55:07", "at Brazil or into need here or any of", "55:09", "the countries of your fake factory the", "55:10", "same phenomenon plummeting have you", "55:13", "thought about what the future looks like", "55:15", "when people live to be four or five", "55:17", "hundred years old like how first of all", "55:19", "how wise will people be that's actually", "55:22", "interesting because so ok so here's", "55:24", "here's a really important thing that I", "55:26", "want to get across when we think about", "55:30", "longevity well actually three things are", "55:34", "worth saying", "55:35", "first of all longevity is a side effect", "55:37", "of health right right so you know huge", "55:41", "amount of the so-called debate that goes", "55:43", "on about the desirability of all of this", "55:45", "just goes away when you remember that", "55:47", "people actually quite like being healthy", "55:48", "but in terms of how the world will be", "55:51", "which is the question you asked there's", "55:52", "two questions here one question is how", "55:55", "will well actually be and the second", "55:56", "question is how well people in the niche", "55:59", "and expect the world to be and the", "56:02", "reason why those two questions are are", "56:04", "important to distinguish is because the", "56:06", "question of how the world will actually", "56:07", "be is very obviously completely", "56:09", "unanswerable even if we look 50th in the", "56:12", "future I mean if you look 50 years ago", "56:14", "right how much of what we have today", "56:15", "would have been predicted right yeah it", "56:18", "was completely different and certainly", "56:20", "in terms of longevity you know we're", "56:22", "only gonna be getting older at one year", "56:24", "per year it won't actually be any 500", "56:27", "year old people for another 400 years", "56:28", "I'll realize well yeah I mean the past", "56:38", "change the rate of the passage of time", "56:40", "it's my point right I understand we're", "56:42", "saying right but expectation is a", "56:45", "completely different thing and here's", "56:47", "why that matters there's going to become", "56:49", "a point there's gonna come a point where", "56:51", "people in general the general man in the", "56:54", "street starts to realize that they're", "56:58", "probably going to live an awfully long", "56:59", "time because they're not going to just", "57:01", "get progressively sicker as they get", "57:03", "older and you know lots of other reasons", "57:06", "are going to exist why they're going to", "57:08", "live", "57:08", "like we're gonna have self-driving cars", "57:09", "that pretty much eliminate you know road", "57:12", "accidents and so on so they're going to", "57:16", "want a lot of different things than what", "57:20", "they wanted when they thought they were", "57:22", "gonna live only slightly longer than", "57:23", "their parents they're gonna want very", "57:25", "different pension plans very different", "57:28", "life insurance health insurance very", "57:30", "differently inheritance arrangements and", "57:31", "these are huge big-ticket items right", "57:34", "they basically drive the global economy", "57:37", "suppose he makers and decision makers", "57:39", "around the world had damn well better be", "57:41", "ready for that shift in public", "57:45", "expectation of how long ago live right", "57:48", "yes now therefore is is absolutely", "57:53", "critical to estimate and to communicate", "57:58", "the estimate of how soon that shift in", "58:03", "public expectation is going to occur", "58:05", "which means how well what events have to", "58:09", "happen how much progress needs to happen", "58:11", "in order for that in order to cause that", "58:14", "shift now this is where I am terrified", "58:19", "because I think it's gonna happen really", "58:21", "soon I think it could easily happen in", "58:25", "the next three to five years and that", "58:28", "when it does happen it's gonna happen", "58:30", "incredibly suddenly it's the sequence of", "58:33", "events that I think is going to happen", "58:35", "step one we're going to have sufficient", "58:38", "progress in the laboratory or the clinic", "58:42", "that most of my scientific colleagues", "58:45", "are going to be willing to come out and", "58:49", "say more or less yeah Oh buddy grabbers", "58:52", "right although they're gonna say yeah", "58:54", "you know it's very excited about that no", "58:57", "I'm terrified and I'm gonna tell you", "58:58", "what I mean I know I have been but yeah", "59:07", "they're gonna they're gonna come and say", "59:08", "yeah it's only a matter of time before", "59:09", "we let this aging thing now what do you", "59:12", "think's gonna happen next you're a media", "59:14", "guy right yeah well I think it's gonna", "59:16", "happen but I want your I know whether", "59:17", "you think I'm right okay I think the", "59:19", "next things going to happen is that real", "59:21", "informers people like you people like", "59:23", "Oprah Winfrey are going to hear that", "59:26", "being said and written you know in the", "59:28", "media and they're gonna say oh shit", "59:32", "this is actually gonna happen and", "59:34", "they're gonna say so on-air and they're", "59:38", "going not only to say so what their", "59:40", "opinion is but they're gonna say what", "59:41", "they think people ought to do in", "59:43", "particularly they're gonna say well look", "59:45", "you know let's actually if we if if it's", "59:47", "only a matter of time if we're losing a", "59:49", "hundred and ten thousand people every", "59:52", "day worldwide to this phenomenon then we", "59:55", "do kind of have a bit of a moral", "59:56", "obligation to make it less time if we", "59:59", "can so my sense is that once that", "60:02", "happens the following day it's going to", "60:05", "become impossible to get elected and if", "60:06", "you have a manifesto commitment to you", "60:09", "know have a war on aging you know throw", "60:11", "proper money at this I mean I really", "60:12", "mean a proper war in aging not just like", "60:14", "the war on cancer was lots of money not", "60:17", "just really the research but also to", "60:19", "front-load all of the investment in", "60:20", "infrastructure and you know training and", "60:22", "medical personnel and so on okay and", "60:26", "everyone's gonna know it like the world", "60:29", "the public is going to make that switch", "60:30", "I just mentioned of expectation like at", "60:32", "once so it's going to be ridiculously", "60:35", "sudden once it happens and the first", "60:38", "step is going to be that shift in what", "60:41", "my colleagues in the Bo gerontology", "60:43", "community feel able to say on camera and", "60:48", "on stage now therefore the question is", "60:52", "what amount of progress is going to be", "60:55", "required for that to occur now here's", "60:58", "the thing there aren't very many of us", "61:00", "it's a small field the number of people", "61:02", "at the top of the field who actually", "61:03", "talked to the media quite a bit it's you", "61:05", "know a dozen maximum there's me this", "61:08", "David that you've had on the show", "61:09", "there's you know very few others and we", "61:12", "all know each other we're all good mates", "61:13", "right so we know exactly where our heads", "61:16", "Lee you know what they drivers are the", "61:22", "number one reason why my colleagues", "61:25", "don't already say what I say is funding", "61:29", "the fact that unlike me those people are", "61:34", "Relient for most of the money that", "61:37", "drives their research on peer-reviewed", "61:41", "government money government grants and", "61:46", "they just won't get them if it's", "61:48", "possible to accuse those accuse them of", "61:52", "saying irresponsible things for the", "61:54", "media things that get people's hopes up", "61:57", "unduly remember this hardly isn't", "62:00", "there's nowhere near enough - less than", "62:02", "10 percent of the necessary money to", "62:05", "fund research at the moment so the", "62:06", "committee's that decide who gets money", "62:08", "and who doesn't are always desperately", "62:11", "scouting around for reasons to say no", "62:13", "that can be justified and saying oh this", "62:17", "guy says they're responsible things for", "62:18", "the media a totally safe way to say no", "62:22", "right so anyway so this is this is the", "62:24", "problem this is why my colleagues have", "62:26", "to be really pretty curmudgeonly even", "62:28", "David David is probably the person out", "62:31", "of my colleagues who pushes the envelope", "62:33", "as much as possible out of people who", "62:35", "have regular faculty positions but you", "62:39", "know he's just written a book which I", "62:40", "see you have on yourself and called you", "62:42", "know why we age and why we don't have to", "62:44", "he could not have written that book with", "62:47", "that title five years ago and kept his", "62:50", "job Wow", "62:52", "so you know the question is how much has", "62:55", "to change and actually it's not very", "62:56", "much you know there's a balance here the", "63:00", "tension here between on the one hand not", "63:03", "saying things that can be characterized", "63:04", "as irresponsible but on the other hand", "63:06", "not saying thing that could be", "63:08", "characterized is simply untrue right so", "63:12", "the more progress was made in the", "63:13", "laboratory not even in the clinic just", "63:15", "with mice right in terms of actually you", "63:18", "know rejuvenating them making them live", "63:20", "longer with treatments that were given", "63:22", "to those mice when they were already in", "63:24", "middle age the more progress was made", "63:27", "you know the more impossible it's going", "63:29", "to be to carry on being pessimistic and", "63:31", "refusing to to make timeframe", "63:34", "predictions or anything like that so", "63:36", "there's a almost a forced pessimism", "63:38", "created by this time correct well I", "63:40", "think what you're saying makes a ton of", "63:42", "sense and that once it does get to the", "63:44", "point where this is undeniable there's", "63:48", "is peer-reviewed proven established", "63:51", "science and also implementable this is", "63:55", "something that can be at scale", "63:58", "distributed worldwide yeah things are", "64:01", "gonna get real weird so people are", "64:02", "already people are obviously still gonna", "64:03", "be saying it can't be done in humans you", "64:06", "know it can't really be done you know", "64:09", "until the cows come home you know just", "64:12", "in the same way I've had happen for any", "64:14", "other pioneering technology throughout", "64:16", "history but what matters is what the", "64:19", "center of gravity of expertly stated", "64:22", "expert opinion is it is a really really", "64:26", "polarizing subject I mean it is funny", "64:29", "how what you're saying brings so true", "64:32", "that academics and intellectuals have to", "64:34", "be cautious about talking about even", "64:37", "what is potentially possible even though", "64:40", "in private they probably are more than", "64:44", "aware that there's just a few steps to", "64:46", "go before this stuff gets implemented", "64:49", "and we see really catastrophic tacular", "64:53", "rather changes yeah I mean I'm not", "64:54", "saying that all of us absolutely agree", "64:57", "on 100% on everything in the science", "64:58", "certainly I would say that I'm slightly", "65:01", "on the optimistic end of the spectrum of", "65:04", "expert opinion but yeah my colleagues", "65:06", "are not all that far behind me in that", "65:07", "in terms of what they would say the time", "65:09", "frames are what you're saying in terms", "65:11", "of people discussing it the media makes", "65:13", "absolute sense to me that as soon as", "65:15", "that that Pandora's Box gets opened then", "65:18", "people are going to be looking to", "65:20", "establish clinics everywhere and it's it", "65:22", "could be very strange well even if even", "65:25", "if even if a lot of these things are not", "65:27", "yet available for clinical use even if", "65:30", "some of them are still at the beginning", "65:32", "of the clinical trial process and we're", "65:33", "still maybe 10 or 15 years away from the", "65:35", "real McCoy you know that will still be", "65:38", "enough to trigger this pandemonium and", "65:40", "that's why policymakers decision makers", "65:43", "in every way and but in government and", "65:45", "in key aspect of Industry need to I call", "65:49", "it anticipate the anticipation they need", "65:51", "to be have already thought through and", "65:55", "prepared for this change in public", "65:58", "expectation of how long they're going to", "65:59", "live so you think that this", "66:01", "one day will be a gigantic public issue", "66:05", "in terms of elected representatives that", "66:08", "they they're going to need to have some", "66:09", "sort of an anti-ageing policy that's", "66:12", "right and the switch from essentially", "66:14", "situation normal usual to this", "66:17", "completely new world will be", "66:19", "ridiculously sudden that will happen in", "66:21", "a week and do you think one of the", "66:23", "motivating factors would be the price of", "66:25", "healthcare that the argument would be", "66:27", "part of our issue with healthcare and", "66:30", "the an incredible amount of money that", "66:33", "needs to be spent on hospital as I", "66:35", "hospitalizing peaceful people and", "66:37", "treating them with diseases we could", "66:39", "eliminate that oh yeah that's a huge", "66:41", "part of it you know at the moment when", "66:42", "you talk to any you know any people any", "66:45", "elected representatives any way of a", "66:46", "very persuasion about the aging question", "66:51", "than the immediate knee jerk reaction is", "66:54", "always oh god we definitely don't want", "66:57", "to fix that how would we pay the", "66:59", "pensions alright because they obviously", "67:01", "they know if the economies feel a bit", "67:02", "right it's delayed yeah", "67:05", "and so that's what I think I think and", "67:06", "the fact if you're not going to be able", "67:08", "to get away with that kind of thinking", "67:09", "anymore it's going to have to be a case", "67:12", "of redesigning a large number of really", "67:16", "big parts of the economy from the ground", "67:17", "up well especially places like where you", "67:20", "live in England or use where you're from", "67:22", "rather in England where they have", "67:23", "socialized medicine the enormous cost of", "67:25", "that would be decreased radically we're", "67:28", "healthier it's it's got nothing to do", "67:30", "with private versus socialized medicine", "67:31", "in medicine yeah in the US and the UK", "67:35", "and everywhere else the overwhelming", "67:37", "majority of medical expenditure is on", "67:40", "the health problems of the elderly which", "67:43", "will go away now of course the medicine", "67:46", "that makes those problems go away is not", "67:48", "going to be free I mean to produce and", "67:51", "to deliver so but prevention is always", "67:53", "better than cure but that actually is", "67:55", "only a minority of the economic benefits", "67:58", "the real economic benefit comes from the", "68:01", "indirect cost first of all the fact that", "68:03", "the kids are the elderly are going to be", "68:04", "more productive because they're not", "68:05", "having to spend time looking after their", "68:06", "sick parents and you know relate things", "68:08", "like that but also the huge thing that", "68:10", "the elders themselves are still going", "68:13", "to be able bodied and therefore in a", "68:15", "position to you know continue to", "68:18", "contribute wealth to society right now", "68:20", "that doesn't necessarily mean anything", "68:23", "to do with the retirement age this comes", "68:25", "back to another aspect of the", "68:26", "interaction between emerging", "68:28", "technologies so of course we've got", "68:30", "automation coming I don't work on any", "68:32", "more but let's people do right will make", "68:34", "a huge progress in artificial", "68:35", "intelligence and most people even", "68:37", "conservative commentators say that most", "68:41", "of the jobs that exist today are going", "68:42", "to be gone 20 years from now said", "68:45", "machines will be doing things perfectly", "68:47", "well so you know we're going to happy", "68:48", "completely unable to continue this", "68:51", "system of a an economy based on full", "68:54", "employment you know last time this", "68:56", "happened with the Industrial Revolution", "68:57", "we got away with it by inventing an", "68:59", "entire new sector you know the service", "69:01", "sector that replaced all the jobs that", "69:03", "people didn't have anymore in", "69:04", "manufacturing and agriculture you know", "69:06", "it's not gonna happen this time it's not", "69:08", "gonna happen you know how many people do", "69:09", "you need in the entertainment industry", "69:11", "you know we've got you come on so you", "69:14", "know we're going to have a different", "69:16", "well of course people are already", "69:17", "thinking about that with things like you", "69:19", "know universal basic income yes which is", "69:21", "an extraordinarily blunt instrument it's", "69:24", "just a starting point but you know that", "69:27", "kind of thing is going to have to going", "69:29", "to happen I can totally imagine a", "69:30", "situation in which you know 30 40 years", "69:35", "from now work is something like national", "69:39", "service used to be yeah yeah well you", "69:41", "know well yeah when you're young and", "69:44", "insignificant you do a bit of a few", "69:46", "years of actual work and then yeah but", "69:50", "that means that the whole concept of", "69:52", "pensions it's ridiculous to think about", "69:53", "that so we've got a gas policymakers out", "69:55", "of that mindset and to get them to think", "69:58", "in more global terms about the health", "70:00", "benefits and the benefits the quality of", "70:01", "life of everybody and so on", "70:03", "it is funny that work or the concept of", "70:05", "work is sort of inexorably connected to", "70:08", "society to the point where you think you", "70:09", "have to work but you know meanwhile", "70:12", "people lived for hundreds of thousands", "70:14", "of years without even the concept of", "70:16", "that you know I got a place where you go", "70:18", "where they give you gold coins all right", "70:20", "yeah yeah I mean of course you do have", "70:24", "to have something", "70:24", "something something that fulfills coming", "70:27", "to do that you find fulfilling that's", "70:29", "the argument for universal basic income", "70:31", "right the argument against it is human", "70:33", "nature that people need to be motivated", "70:35", "and they need something to sort of guide", "70:38", "them towards excellence yeah my take is", "70:41", "the other thing that needs a better", "70:42", "education which of course is something", "70:44", "that we could spend the money on that we", "70:45", "save from not having to yeah my glass", "70:48", "half full guy well I don't know anybody", "70:50", "well educated who gets bored you know", "70:53", "yeah I agree with you or anybody who's", "70:56", "been exposed to interesting things right", "70:57", "there are so many things in this world I", "70:59", "mean if I had I would love to live five",

bacterial mechanism", "74:08", "that allows bacteria to defend", "74:10", "themselves against viruses essentially", "74:13", "how it works is that it allows us to", "74:17", "change the sequence of

existed before Chris but a", "74:31", "very laborious very expensive and very", "74:33", "clunky this is far far cheaper and", "74:35", "easier to use", "74:36", "so what that does is it allows us

"74:50", "previously not working now doing that in", "74:54", "the laboratory in a petri dish is fair", "74:57", "enough the question is can we do it in", "74:58", "the body and initially no initially this", "75:03", "technology was too error-prone it was", "75:06", "primed to do what what George Church has", "75:09", "called genetic vandalism and make have", "75:13", "what's called off-target

getting it's getting", "75:32", "that now you can't do everything with", "75:36", "CRISPR one thing you definitely can't do", "75:38", "with CRISPR is insert new genes into the", "75:41", "genome and that's something we really", "75:42", "need to be able to do but actually one", "75:44", "of our big projects is a kind of", "75:46", "two-step thing where we use CRISPR to", "75:49", "make a small

I people speculate all the time", "77:29", "that's just like clickbait stuff that", "77:32", "gets people excited about it yeah okay", "77:34", "but yes so anyway the other thing was", "77:37", "that

telling", "78:13", "you about someone who's been altered", "78:16", "that means that they've probably doing", "78:18", "this for a decade or since Christopher", "78:21", "was initiative initiated

people I'm fascinated", "78:31", "you know it's I don't you know well", "78:34", "that's right I mean that's the attitude", "78:35", "that I have and a lot of people have to", "78:38", "medical

work but then in eight", "80:48", "months in just the pain just went away", "80:49", "and it's continued to get better and", "80:51", "then I sent her down a second time and", "80:53", "I'm gonna keep

including follow up", "82:43", "that's the key thing", "82:44", "yeah so many therapies in regenerative", "82:48", "medicine in general have the potential", "82:50", "to be beneficial over the first you know", "82:53", "a few months to a year or whatever and", "82:54", "then to start having side effects that", "82:57", "those detrimental what have you heard", "82:59", "that are no side effects oh well of", "83:01", "course the biggest thing that we always", "83:02", "have to worry about is cancer because", "83:06", "and this is true for a whole bunch of", "83:08", "things you know telomerase

put in you are", "84:24", "potentially taking the risk of hastening", "84:28", "the onset of actual cancer what is your", "84:32", "opinion on the benefits of fasting in", "84:34", "that regard okay fasting is that okay", "84:37", "well let me first of all talk about", "84:39", "fasting in relation to cancer that's", "84:41", "important people have certainly found", "84:43", "that it's a good thing to do which is", "84:46", "somewhat counterintuitive because in the", "84:48", "later stages of cancers of course", "84:50", "cachexia you know a lot of loss of", "84:52", "muscle and so on but earlier on it seems", "84:56", "that we can set things down I mean", "84:58", "cancers are greedy metabolically you", "85:00", "know they consume a lot of energy so if", "85:02", "you're putting a lot putting if you have", "85:04", "minimizing how many calories you put in", "85:06", "then you have a chance of slowing the", "85:08", "cancer down so the therapies may have a", "85:09", "better chance that certainly been found", "85:14", "let me talk about fasting more generally", "85:17", "that so for sure", "85:20", "in I mean it's been known for nearly a", "85:22", "hundred years that if you give mice or", "85:26", "rats less food than they were likes and", "85:28", "they live longer than they otherwise do", "85:30", "and this is certainly the most", "85:32", "reproducible and best study phenomena in", "85:34", "the whole of biology of aging still", "85:37", "there are mysteries about how it works", "85:38", "but a lot of stuff has been found out", "85:40", "and many of my colleagues including", "85:43", "David I've made their careers by making", "85:47", "progress in but making discovering", "85:49", "insights in that area", "85:50", "there are a lot of that is that we now", "85:53", "have something that people have always", "85:54", "recognized to be rather important namely", "85:56", "drugs that trick the body into thinking", "85:59", "it's fasting when it isn't yeah they", "86:02", "called calorie restriction memetics", "86:04", "and you know that's good that's that's", "86:08", "also worthwhile think because of course", "86:10", "people like eating and so um you know it", "86:12", "would be useful then there are", "86:15", "variations on the themes a guy from", "86:17", "close to hairline insulted longest for", "86:20", "us sake in photo longer has has been", "86:23", "really the pioneer of intermittent", "86:25", "fasting which is basically properly", "86:28", "starting a hundred percent but only for", "86:29", "two days a week or something like that", "86:30", "you know different people have tried", "86:31", "different schedules and all of these", "86:33", "things are pretty interesting in terms", "86:36", "of being good for your health but in", "86:39", "terms of increasing your longevity by", "86:41", "thirty or forty percent the way they're", "86:43", "doing mice and rats no way it turns out", "86:47", "and this is a prediction of

fasting", "86:59", "in particular that longer live species", "87:02", "get less benefit from fasting than", "87:04", "shorter live species so if you do it", "87:06", "just right in nematode worms that", "87:09", "normally live like three weeks then you", "87:11", "can multiply their lifespan by a factor", "87:14", "of five or more right you sure if I", "87:17", "can't do that with a mouse however you", "87:18", "do it you can get up to maybe fifty", "87:20", "percent maybe sixty percent if you", "87:21", "really really work at it some of the", "87:22", "person you might be able to eke out a", "87:23", "year or two with yeah that's right with", "87:25", "with dogs that's been tried you get", "87:27", "maybe ten percent with monkey if you get", "87:28", "a few percent if you're lucky that's a", "87:30", "bit controversial right now you know", "87:32", "yeah that's why is it a bit", "87:33", "controversial because there were two", "87:34", "studies done really long expensive", "87:36", "studies obviously cos monkeys live a", "87:37", "long time and they got different results", "87:39", "and so the question is why they get", "87:42", "results if you look closely exactly how", "87:44", "the experiments were done that it's", "87:46", "pretty easy to see that they've got", "87:47", "different results because of different", "87:48", "methodologies slightly different", "87:50", "methodologies and that the real answer", "87:52", "is somewhere between the two", "87:53", "so yeah hmm and with dogs you said you", "87:56", "get 10% about that yeah this with", "87:58", "Labradors that live", "88:00", "eleven year oh but isn't that normal", "88:03", "that's like website I'm saying if they", "88:06", "got about another year Oh they've got to", "88:08", "understand that's done so fasting with", "88:13", "human beings you think is it's", "88:15", "interesting it's something but it's not", "88:18", "gonna mimic these biologics and what", "88:22", "what you believe

"89:09", "things only go further than that it", "89:11", "extends to like you know meditation and", "89:13", "yes yoga and so on everything that", "89:16", "relates to stress is very important in",
