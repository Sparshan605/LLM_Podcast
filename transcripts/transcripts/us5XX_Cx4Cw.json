so so it's changed my", "07:44", "political thinking quite a bit and then", "07:47", "I think it's also you know when I see", "07:49", "the way that the scientific debate is", "07:51", "played out and I and you know I know the", "07:53", "science so intimately now you know I", "07:57", "know I've read every single nutrition", "08:01", "experiment that has really been done", "08:03", "since the mid 50's and you know when I", "08:05", "see the way the debate plays out in", "08:07", "public you know I see that a American", "08:09", "Heart Association presidential advisory", "08:11", "which I see

you have", "08:53", "institutions like Harvard and Tufts and", "08:55", "you know all of our top institutions are", "08:57", "so deeply invested in this wrong", "08:58", "hypothesis yet I don't even

the way it is manipulated", "09:20", "by financial interests and and", "09:24", "professional interests and intellectual", "09:27", "conflicts of interest and and so you", "09:30", "know even little tiny things like", "09:32", "anything a warning label on a bottle", "09:33", "like you know careful of this plastic or", "09:36", "this or that I'm like I don't believe", "09:38", "anything unless I go back to the", "09:39", "original science and read it all myself", "09:41", "which I could never do I just won't", "09:43", "trust anything anymore that's not a good", "09:45", "place to be",
