juicy contract", "10:22", "yes you know in order to make that valid", "10:25", "or yeah viable right to make money off", "10:28", "it yeah and but that again I think it", "10:31", "makes it makes it deeper and harder and", "10:34", "more chances to fail epically and and I", "10:37", "lost twice in a row and then still", "10:39", "wanted to fight again and still because", "10:41", "it I really wanted to and and it was", "10:44", "important to me and it meant something", "10:45", "to me and I was going to change as a", "10:47", "human being by doing it and I was", "10:49", "ridiculed I can relate to what he's", "10:51", "going through but I did it on a little", "10:52", "show in Winnipeg Manitoba I would never", "10:56", "have put myself in that place to look", "11:00", "bad but here he is and here it is", "11:02", "I'm cheering for him as a store as a", "11:05", "human being in a weird situation that", "11:09", "has been put himself into a deep dark", "11:12", "hard spot and saying my way out of this", "11:14", "is to try really hard and really go in", "11:16", "and and the chance all that I would want", "11:20", "for him if I knew him and he was my", "11:21", "friend is to fight your way through some", "11:24", "adverse situations to be able to be in", "11:26", "it and find when it's hard you discover", "11:29", "yeah I can handle when it's hard I can I", "11:31", "can get up when I've been dropped or I", "11:33", "can fight through not being able to", "11:34", "breathe if he loses and does that it", "11:36", "will have been worth it for him no", "11:38", "matter how much ridicule he'll take it", "11:40", "will have been worth it for him what was", "11:41", "really weird watching him walk to the", "11:43", "cage was that he was approaching it like", "11:45", "a pro wrestling fight because he had", "11:47", "done so many of these pro wrestling", "11:48", "matches that he's walking to the cage", "11:50", "with like pro wrestling mannerisms and", "11:53",

"like whoever on everybody's his side he", "12:07", "said that he could fight Mickey Gaul", "12:08", "you're out of your fucking mind", "12:10", "watch that kid fight once that kid is", "12:11", "very good on the ground yeah very good", "12:14", "young stand-ups not bad either yeah you", "12:17", "know and he's tough as shit he's smart", "12:19", "he's clever and he's mean he's a mean", "12:22", "fucker and that is at that stage he was", "12:25", "maybe one to know I think or maybe two", "12:27", "but it's still the lowest level that", "12:29", "there is in the entire elite world of", "12:32", "fighting not that it didn't matter was", "12:33", "the way one like you saw it you saw the", "12:36", "way he took that guy's back and the way", "12:39", "sinks hooks in and when when he was on", "12:41", "top and just delivered like yeah that's", "12:45", "and you're a hundred percent right what", "12:47", "if somebody's watching that that is the", "12:49", "reality of thinking I won't really war", "12:51", "like I'll put myself in a situation that", "12:53", "I can't win but I've got guts in hard", "12:56", "and I believe I'm going to do it you get", "12:58", "the metaphorical version of that punch", "13:00", "in the face if you go through life like", "13:01", "that yes you do and you know what you", "13:03", "shouldn't do it in fighting because you", "13:05", "don't want

it against someone who's", "13:16", "of your skill level and try to figure", "13:18", "your way through the maze of this", "13:19", "contest that makes sense what doesn't", "13:22", "make sense is getting punched in the", "13:24", "face unnecessarily and when you fight in", "13:27", "my opinion when I looked at that fight I", "13:29", "was like Miki God's gonna smash him this", "13:31", "is just how it's going to go there's", "13:33", "very few fights where I can tell you", "13:34", "this is absolutely gonna happen like", "13:36", "here's a perfect example Robbie over", "13:37", "half failed dos Anjos against Colby", "13:40", "Covington I don't know what the fuck's", "13:42", "happened no idea I don't know no you're", "13:43", "gonna get in there they're gonna throw", "13:44",

Brooks Phil Brooks sorry Phil I", "14:05", "was like well he's this is a terrible", "14:08", "idea because he's just gonna get put you", "14:10", "can only get punched in the face so many", "14:11", "times in your life yeah and you have a", "14:13", "number whatever the number is", "14:14", "everybody's different mark hunts number", "14:16", "seems to be extraordinarily high yeah", "14:18", "there's some people that could just take", "14:20", "it it's true but you know you don't want", "14:23", "it when you can't avoid it and he could", "14:25", "he's not gonna avoid it in that fight I", "14:27", "was gonna get smashed", "14:28", "unless Mickey caught a crazy armbar", "14:30", "early in the fight and that was what he", "14:32", "gave him that's yeah other than that", "14:34", "he's getting his face smashed in and you", "14:36", "should not do that if you don't have to", "14:37", "well that and I remember when we spoke", "14:40", "about it it's unconscious incompetence", "14:42", "yeah and that if you don't know what you", "14:45", "don't know like it's a really fucking", "14:49", "weird place to be and we go through life", "14:50", "that way a lot of times in a lot of",

now", "15:01", "he's at that point and he has a lower", "15:02", "level thing so and you know he didn't it", "15:05", "was a mistake to start down this road", "15:07", "but you're down it now yeah you're on it", "15:09", "now so I guess you know it seems to me", "15:13", "that I mean he's taken what two years", "15:16", "since that fight yeah it's been about", "15:18", "two years getting there yeah and we've", "15:20", "subsequently got to see Mickey gall and", "15:22", "some contests against some really tough", "15:25", "guys agent and yeah beat some good guys", "15:28", "and we got to see

not", "29:26", "holding anything back man he goes for it", "29:29", "and that's why I think when we were", "29:31", "talking about fight and art to me that's", "29:34", "an art of human expression

talk to him like we", "56:43", "hang out he I got to fucking train", "56:45", "karate with his team like point karate", "56:47", "you know and so he made all Robins", "56:49", "training with us today what kind of", "56:51", "point karate training do they do and do", "56:52", "they do this to practice like blitzing", "56:54", "yeah and just think of this like an eye", "56:57", "you were big on point karate like", "56:59", "2012-2013 and I didn't disagree but I", "57:03", "didn't really get nervous yeah it was so", "57:08", "magical to see like and I wasn't just", "57:11", "like how does he kick him like how does", "57:12", "you think can here why does he do the", "57:14", "things he does and what's his motivation", "57:16", "and it really made me a better human", "57:18", "being getting to do that but so what I", "57:21", "didn't really connect to it's sometimes", "57:23", "there's something so simple and we don't", "57:25", "see it", "57:26", "we're in were deep in up whatever we're", "57:28", "in but the idea of point karate yeah", "57:31", "people right away say well they're just", "57:32", "touching each other it's like it true so", "57:34", "if I'm training to just touch you I'm", "57:36", "not training to hurt you okay that seems", "57:37", "like that's not valuable you're training", "57:39", "to not let me even fucking touch you if", "57:43", "you can't get touched by me how hard", "57:45", "impossible is it for me to hit you clean", "57:47", "you know what I mean if your movement", "57:49", "and your your defensive systems and your", "57:52", "management of the of the distance", "57:54", "between our weapons and targets are such", "57:56", "then I can't fucking touch you how can I", "57:59", "hurt you if I can't even like get touch", "58:01", "you with my gloves well the thing is", "58:03", "here's what I think about point fighting", "58:06", "and what what I think was valid about it", "58:08", "is if you're just doing point fighting", "58:10", "with a point fighter", "58:12", "it is extremely frustrated I've fought", "58:14", "in point fighting tournaments when I was", "58:15", "competing and we there was I came from a", "58:19", "full-contact Taekwondo background and we", "58:22", "fought in these tournaments and the", "58:23", "object was to knock people unconscious", "58:24", "and you would fight you know there were", "58:26", "three minute rounds and you would fight", "58:28", "and you would try to kick people into", "58:30", "another very similar in Canada when I", "58:32", "said what we there was a lot of people", "58:34", "that I trained with that openly", "58:36", "dismissed point fighting and the reason", "58:38", "why they openly dismiss point fighting", "58:40", "was because they would stop every time", "58:42", "someone get touched and I would be like", "58:44", "well in the real world or everybody", "58:45", "would say in the real world you don't", "58:47", "just stop when you get touched you keep", "58:49", "fighting and so with our techniques a", "58:51", "lot of it you would hit someone once and", "58:54", "they would counter and then you'd set up", "58:55", "the big shot afterwards it's like this", "58:57", "is part of the thing and if the the", "58:59", "referee kept stopping you then you would", "59:01", "never get anything done but my thinking", "59:04", "once I got into MMA was okay yeah but if", "59:08", "you can do that and do the other things", "59:11", "it's like people dismiss Taekwondo", "59:14", "because they were like well Taekwondo", "59:15", "you know you get taken to the ground you", "59:18", "get your legs kicked out absolutely but", "59:20", "if you have takedown defense and you", "59:24", "know muy Thai you can wheel kick someone", "59:26", "into another fuckin dimension and we saw", "59:29", "that with Edson Barboza versus Terry", "59:31", "Adam we've seen these Taekwondo", "59:33", "techniques manifests themselves in MMA", "59:35", "and you realize like oh these are", "59:38", "the most powerful things you could do to", "59:39", "a person inside a cage but when you see", "59:43", "the point fighting style they like the", "59:46", "Raymond Daniel's or the Michael venom", "59:47", "page this ability to blitz if they can", "59:51", "do those other things too this is", "59:52", "another another level there's something", "59:55", "to it so as a fighter I wasn't willing", "59:57", "to dismiss point fighting because I had", "60:00", "been lied to already I when I went and", "60:02", "took Taekwondo and then started", "60:04", "kickboxing first American kickboxing", "60:07", "above the waist first thing I realized", "60:08", "was how easy it was for me to get", "60:10", "punched in the face I was like oh okay", "60:13", "you know if I'm trapped in this ring and", "60:15", "I can't go anywhere and someone's", "60:16", "throwing punches and I don't understand", "60:18", "how to get away from him and I'm used to", "60:19", "this Taekwondo style of having your", "60:20", "hands down low I'm getting fucked up so", "60:23", "I've been lied to", "60:23", "Taekwondo is not the best martial art", "60:25", "none of them are yeah there's exactly", "60:27", "nothing Zac there is no best but there", "60:29", "is something absolutely legit about that", "60:32", "blitz in karate blitz that some of these", "60:36", "guys can do and I fought some really", "60:38", "good guys in those karate style", "60:40", "tournaments and and I got an ass made", "60:42", "out of me I mean you you don't know what", "60:44", "to do like and if you get your kicked", "60:46", "and then the referees point in the other", "60:49", "you don't have a chance to fire back", "60:51", "because they're separating you guys and", "60:53", "I I really absorb those lessons and I", "60:56", "was like in MMA that ability to close", "60:59", "the distance because every in MMA", "61:00", "there's so many guys and Conor talked", "61:03", "about this there's so many guys that", "61:04", "have this muy Thai stance and they're", "61:07", "the presenting that's very predictable", "61:08", "targer they're standing right in front", "61:10", "of each other and I think this stance", "61:12", "and especially this the change though", "61:15", "the forward stance is one of the reasons", "61:18", "why Vitor has been caught and knocked", "61:20", "out twice with front kicks because he", "61:22", "squares off Vitor explained this to me", "61:25", "in like shit 1997 when I was training at", "61:29", "Carlsen Gracie's he was explaining that", "61:32", "you know some kick boxers are going to", "61:34", "have a hard time in MMA even though", "61:37", "they're really good kick boxers because", "61:38", "the MMA stance you really have to square", "61:41", "off more you can't stand like this you", "61:43", "can't stand like a boxer and a kickboxer", "61:46", "is a little more open than a boxer but", "61:48", "then MMA is a little more open than that", "61:50", "you almost have to be square but that", "61:52", "square leaves you open to front kicks to", "61:55", "the face and then start turning aside", "61:57", "kicks and side kicks to the body", "61:59", "think about what Vito has been dropped", "62:00", "with John Jones dropped in with a side", "62:01", "kick to the body", "62:03", "Sakuraba dropped him with a turning side", "62:05", "kick to the body front kick to the front", "62:07", "kick to the face it's because it", "62:08", "presents this square thing but to him", "62:10", "this is sprawl and throw punches and", "62:13", "throw that they like the Blitz that he", "62:15", "use on vandal e Silva yeah and it worked", "62:16", "much of his career he either won with it", "62:19", "or lost with yes and I respect that", "62:21", "thinking but those types of doctrines", "62:24", "like is literally and in martial arts in", "62:28", "day to day life in anything if you think", "62:31", "anything is nothing you're totally wrong", "62:33", "right because if we all agree it's", "62:35", "nothing then we all acting like it's", "62:37", "nothing then we all start ignoring other", "62:39", "things and those things will work so if", "62:41", "you have to if MMA you have to square up", "62:44", "all of a sudden some guys some Conor", "62:46", "comes out with a different thing and you", "62:47", "were wonderful Thompson yeah that the", "62:49", "guard is the one that is glaring to me", "62:52", "right now because and I mean I've talked", "62:55", "to some of the smartest and the best and", "62:57", "they will and we do this over and over", "62:59", "again and we do it in everything you", "63:01", "know remember when you you're you cannot", "63:03", "cross your feet when you do an armbar", "63:05", "remember that head kicks don't work and", "63:11", "ever met like you know this has been", "63:13", "going on forever so any absolute", "63:15", "decision that this is a fundamental rule", "63:17", "is completely that's where you're gonna", "63:20", "get fucked yeah I mean how about the low", "63:22", "calf kick yeah I mean look Benson", "63:24", "Henderson was in my opinion the first", "63:26", "guy to break yes MMA and he started", "63:29", "doing that back in the day but not at", "63:31", "the effectiveness the level of", "63:32", "effectiveness that we're seeing now that", "63:34", "low calf kick is fucking people up it's", "63:37", "really interesting and then they'll", "63:39", "adapt and then it won't work but that", "63:41", "adaptation will put something else that", "63:43", "available I'll think of the problem with", "63:45", "the low calf kick is that you really", "63:47", "can't condition the lower part of your", "63:49", "leg the same way you can your thighs and", "63:51", "I think it's going to keep working but", "63:53", "then we have to not get hit by it so", "63:55", "we'll make a change to not get hit by", "63:56", "and once we do that'll force us to do", "63:58", "something else that someone will take", "63:59", "advantage just it's amazing how quickly", "64:01", "it works like if you see a guy", "64:04", "get hit with a brutal leg kick like it", "64:06", "takes one or two and then they start to", "64:08", "feel it there's something about the", "64:09", "first low calf kick you see guys wobbly", "64:11", "like that that muscle is like really", "64:13", "than the insertion at the bottom is so", "64:16", "small it's opaque you see and it's", "64:18", "taking so much work like it's carrying", "64:20", "so much yeah yeah it's it's these are", "64:24", "when things work beautifully and again", "64:26", "like I used to take anything we'd talk", "64:28", "about and I'd bring it back to fighting", "64:29", "now I tend to take anything and fighting", "64:32", "and I try to figure out what it means in", "64:34", "life like I'm kind of over time of study", "64:37", "I've started to do that right and this", "64:40", "is true of this kick and it's true of", "64:42", "anything it's like know that what it", "64:44", "works best when the physiological truth", "64:47", "that calf is small and weak and then", "64:49", "works with the systemic issue he's got", "64:52", "his foot there in the way he's standing", "64:54", "is such that you can hit it too those", "64:55", "two things together are making that", "64:57", "thing work right now if you what you", "65:00", "can't change the strength of the calf so", "65:02", "the only thing we can change is how", "65:04", "available that calf kick is if we don't", "65:06", "want to get hit with it so we must", "65:08", "change that and if we do we've changed a", "65:10", "lot of different things and now", "65:11", "something else is available that Dewayne", "65:13", "or Duke or somebody else is already", "65:16", "planning how to how to take advantage", "65:17", "that you've made that adaptation and", "65:20", "that that is for me what is eternally", "65:23", "fascinating about martial arts but again", "65:24", "that's those are the lessons of life", "65:26", "that are there if you can't see that the", "65:29", "world around you has changed", "65:31", "dramatically and you act as if it's the", "65:32", "same you get fucked up you will get", "65:35", "fucked up you know I bring this to Paul", "65:38", "Daley versus John Fitch because that", "65:41", "fight was extremely frustrating to Paul", "65:43", "Daley and frustrated a lot of people", "65:46", "that were watching it too because John", "65:47", "Fitch was just able to take him down and", "65:49", "kind of do what John Fitch does and hit", "65:52", "him on the ground and kind of beat him", "65:54", "up and controlled the position and and", "65:56", "you know at the end of the fight Paul's", "65:57", "yelling boo it was so strange you know", "66:01", "and but this is a guy that if you just", "66:05", "stand with him he's going to fuck you up", "66:08", "like if you just decide to trade shots", "66:10", "with Paul daily on your feet he's got a", "66:12", "left hand that is a goddamn nuclear", "66:14", "missile you know and he basically", "66:16", "everybody he hits with", "66:17", "that thing goes night-night it's scary", "66:19", "even lorenz larkin who's a seasoned", "66:21", "striker he got clipped by that left hand", "66:23", "is like you'll the ability to make", "66:26",

and then", "123:10", "you see the pictures even that's wild", "123:13", "man and what I'm saying is I would have", "123:16", "I would not be the slightest bit", "123:17", "surprised if he could do it because", "123:19", "we've seen enough overtime to know that", "123:21", "what a 23 year old is capable of they'll", "123:24", "see the whole game differently they'll", "123:27", "see there are their understanding of", "123:29", "where they are in relation to the other", "123:31", "guy is so different that it's just on", "123:33", "what one day all of a sudden all these", "123:35", "25 year olds are just so fucking good", "123:37", "and we don't really have the language to", "123:39", "explain why you know can we just say oh", "123:42", "he was able to close the distance on", "123:44", "Stephen Thompson if he does well say yes", "123:46", "but then the question will be how when", "123:49", "nobody else could do it", "123:50", "how and why could he do it and that's", "123:53", "always what obsesses me", "123:55", "if you see him do it there is now the", "123:57", "explanation isn't he was better at", "123:59", "closing the distance or his range", "124:01", "management was excellent but that's true", "124:03", "for a bit but then my next question the", "124:05", "next morning will be like how the fuck", "124:06", "did he do it", "124:07", "what changed now what about the the", "124:10", "entirety of the game itself the systems", "124:13", "of the relationships of two fighters", "124:14", "what changed in such a way because of", "124:16", "his behavior and that's where it gets to", "124:19", "me really really wild cuz right now", "124:21", "nobody gets to Stephen Thompson and I", "124:24", "mean nobody really at all", "124:25", "sirens knocked him down twice had him", "124:28", "really bad sir there's 50 minutes 50", "124:30", "minutes he had like the fight those the", "124:33", "helmets in the fight were they engaged", "124:34", "see the problem with those two tyron", "124:36", "woodley fighters would they fought", "124:37", "wonderboy the right way that's how you", "124:39", "got to fight them you don't engage and", "124:41", "when you do engage you got to be", "124:42", "absolutely convinced you're gonna land", "124:43", "and Tyron did and did land and hurt him", "124:46", "I mean you looked at those two fights", "124:48", "Tyron is the one who's the wrestler but", "124:49", "he's also the one that hurt wonder boy", "124:51", "wondering why I never hurt time in those", "124:52", "fights know that ayran had him very", "124:55", "close to being out and I just wonder if", "124:58", "wonder boy is starting to slip you know", "125:01", "you got a wonder you got a wonder if all", "125:04", "his years of combat sports all of his", "125:06", "years of kickboxing and me got to", "125:07", "remember this guy is one of the most", "125:08", "spectacular kickboxing records ever I", "125:10", "mean what he's like 57 and kickboxing", "125:14", "and then he gets into MMA and you know", "125:17", "he loses to Matt Brown he gets kind of", "125:19", "beat up on the ground comes back has", "125:22", "some really good fights and you know", "125:24", "it's been in there with world-class", "125:26", "fighters and beating some world-class", "125:27", "fighters but he's also I want to say", "125:30", "he's 34th yeah five and there was a lot", "125:33", "of fights although we didn't get until", "125:35", "recently until those three examples he", "125:37", "didn't really get hit all that much but", "125:39", "it's still the where Stephen Thompson", "125:40", "find out how old Wonder Boy is he might", "125:43", "even be 35 the hips and the knees and", "125:45", "the shoulders and that hole yeah yeah", "125:49", "but and there's also that what he I mean", "125:53", "he developed mastery I mean what he does", "125:56", "yeah and once you've developed that", "125:58", "elite elite top level of reached your", "126:01", "highest potential it's hard to keep", "126:03", "going mhm and then the masses start to", "126:06", "close that distance the the general", "126:08", "young kid start you know a kid at", "126:10", "Tristar like some of their young guys", "126:12", "they have that and they've had Thompson", "126:14", "in there for years and for us has been", "126:16", "able to study people like that up close", "126:17", "and they all studied leo doe now the", "126:20", "young guy can do a lot of those things", "126:23", "at a much higher level than fighters", "126:25", "that came before them so your level of", "126:27", "mastery starts you plateau to a point", "126:30", "that it's hard to go beyond it's it's", "126:32", "really hard work and sometimes it", "126:33", "requires you to get a little shittier", "126:34", "for a bit to go past that Plateau", "126:38", "weekend or get worse by having to", "126:41", "re-examine what you believe and the way", "126:43", "that you train or the way that you fight", "126:45", "to break through a plateau you've got to", "126:47", "kind of be willing to go backwards a bit", "126:49", "and when you're fighting tyron woodley", "126:50", "czar the world you cannot go backwards", "126:52", "so it's kind of kind of stalls you there", "126:54", "so but ultimately the big question also", "126:58", "is is there some other strategy that", "127:00", "hasn't yet been done that is a Stephen", "127:02", "Thompson beater and that low leg kick", "127:04", "you talked about not me so I cannot get", "127:07", "to you so what would I would prefer when", "127:10", "I'm fighting Stephen Thompson body lock", "127:11", "if I can get to the body lock I'll rip", "127:13", "him down okay to get to a body like I", "127:14", "got a touch him that's really hard he", "127:16", "stops me from doing that or I gotta hit", "127:19", "him or kick him but when I do that he", "127:21", "moves away in hits what if I can just", "127:23", "get to the edge of his sort of bubble of", "127:26", "hot in that hot range where he can hurt", "127:29", "you and maybe that low leg kick is a", "127:31", "part of that you know maybe that low leg", "127:33", "just getting on the outside of it where", "127:35", "you're still somewhat safe but you can", "127:37", "smash him up a little bit maybe those", "127:38", "are a weapon that hasn't been used well", "127:40", "it's this is also arguably the best", "127:44", "striker that Wonderboys ever faced in", "127:45", "MMA arguably right I mean mas Badal is", "127:49", "very talented striker as well but Wonder", "127:52", "Boy is a master of that front leg and", "127:55", "that front leg is a real tricky one", "127:57", "because that karate style that he uses", "127:59", "he keeps his hands down low", "128:00", "he stands totally sideways on you and", "128:02", "you got to get past that front leg side", "128:04", "kick and Johnny couldn't get past it", "128:06", "Hendricks got lit up by that front leg", "128:08", "side kick and then front roundhouse kick", "128:10", "to the face right afterwards it's just", "128:11", "there's a lot going on with that front", "128:13", "leg if you're not used to that and then", "128:15", "if you if you get too obsessed with it", "128:17", "the back leg comes mm-hmm yeah till is a", "128:20", "way better", "128:22", "on he's a way better master of distance", "128:24", "he understands distance and strike and", "128:26", "knows how to close that distance with", "128:27", "explosive power very interesting really", "128:30", "interest and before he fought cowboy his", "128:33", "successes were fighting at distance and", "128:35", "smashing guys who came in so he does do", "128:38", "that he does by doing it you understand", "128:42", "it on a different level you connect to", "128:44", "it it is in a more tie way whereas", "128:46", "Wonder Boy does in the crime way and", "128:47", "Wonder Boy is fantastic at moving his", "128:50", "waist back and forth like a snake and", "128:53", "jump Tony is really good at - yes Tony", "128:55", "Ferguson yeah and that so when I get to", "129:00", "go study Santa and Kung Fu and wushu", "129:04", "there are you know my some of my friends", "129:06", "are like well you know like enjoy it I'm", "129:08", "like nah that's going to be some", "129:09", "brilliant shit to learn over here this", "129:11", "and some of that long fist stuff like", "129:14", "people will often say what kung fu is", "129:15", "not super relevant some of that long", "129:17", "fist reaching where I move my body", "129:19", "through space to reach you which people", "129:21", "would say is dangerous you get countered", "129:23", "but yet the answer is don't get", "129:25", "countered the answer isn't discard a", "129:27", "valuable weapon and so you see some of", "129:29", "that Tony does that stuff really really", "129:31", "really well really cool he does see him", "129:33", "work with the Wing Chun Wing Chun - when", "129:38", "I'm sitting in your guard wanting to", "129:40", "beat you up", "129:41", "tell me that isn't Wing Chun just wear", "129:42", "it - that's what that is that's what", "129:44", "that is right yeah that mean there's", "129:46", "techniques in every single art that are", "129:48", "like an established realistic art that", "129:51", "are valuable you know and there's", "129:52", "there's got to be something in Wing Chun", "129:54", "that people are missing for sure for", "129:56", "sure for sure it's there and it", "129:58", "I mean arts like that people would look", "130:02", "at and might discard because they would", "130:03", "think they're limited to only this", "130:05", "scenario", "130:06", "well that scenario happens mm-hmm if I'm", "130:08", "in your guard and I want to fight we are", "130:10", "that's that scenario sure so that thing", "130:12", "may not be useful to fight you know", "130:15", "Frank Mir but that thing will be useful", "130:17", "in a context when you're fighting a guy", "130:19", "like well how about Jon Jones is use of", "130:21", "you grab his wrist and he comes over the", "130:23", "top of the Nell bow yeah I mean that is", "130:25", "hand

how and why", "130:34", "that hasn't been", "130:35", "Dravid hauled a lot more although you do", "130:37", "start to see that in that moment where", "130:39", "we're you know I get to all four I get", "130:42", "to four points and I'm going to stand up", "130:44", "and you just kind of decide okay that's", "130:46", "alright we'll get back to the fence in", "130:48", "that process of standing
