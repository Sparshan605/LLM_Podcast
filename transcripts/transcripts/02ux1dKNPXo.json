"26:52", "CNN in DC and for several minutes was", "26:55", "yelling at him while they filmed and", "26:56", "apparently that's my understanding was", "26:59", "the justification for banning him that",

I", "27:23", "think it also happened on YouTube they", "27:25", "like collectively said if you do", "27:26", "something on our platform sorry if you", "27:29", "do something on another platform and we", "27:31", "see that you could lose your status on", "27:33", "our platform too or if that means public", "27:36", "also and we see that with with patreon", "27:39", "but I don't want to deviate into patreon", "27:41", "yeah we can we could get to that later", "27:42", "but so so I in my opinion", "27:46", "so it's make it makes a good point how", "27:48", "does Alex Jones get banned for giving", "27:51", "that guy a hard time but Kathy Griffin", "27:53", "doesn't get banned for literally calling", "27:55", "for these children leading a harassment", "27:56", "campaign against aims of
