I'm", "46:40", "not staying there and I think that", "46:42", "that's sort of the more responsible way", "46:44", "of doing is that you're allowed your", "46:46", "evolution but you have to let people", "46:47", "know I'm gonna do something totally", "46:51", "different from time to time I like the", "46:54", "idea of doing things or just do it just", "46:56", "do it", "46:56", "yeah don't

you're saying this is bizarre", "84:14", "series of numbers right what is it doing", "84:17", "like what how do we interface with it", "84:20", "well so for example let's let's take an", "84:24",

say are they a message do they have", "86:36", "meaning we can prove that they're there", "86:38", "I construct them for you but they", "86:41", "generate so much bizarreness in some", "86:43", "sort of abstract space how would they", "86:45", "recognize like how how was it how did it", "86:47", "come to be that this is a point of", "86:49", "discussion well there's there's a", "86:50", "process in fact they're two processes", "86:52", "where you can build these number systems", "86:54", "up from each other so you build the", "86:56", "complex from the real you build the", "86:58",

that", "99:21", "whatever it is I don't care maybe it's", "99:26", "maybe it's some beautiful social thing", "99:27", "well do you do but then they'll hit you", "99:29", "with you don't care because you're a", "99:30", "white male and you have white male", "99:32", "privilege and I don't and what I realize", "99:35", "is is that it's important in as", "99:37", "inclusion is exclusion is equally", "99:39", "important and the instant you say that I", "99:41", "don't know you the time of day what does", "99:43", "that mean by exclusion well we important", "99:45", "we keep talking about diversity and", "99:48", "inclusion diversity inclusion inclusion", "99:50", "and there's an implicit threat in that", "99:52", "which is what makes it really juicy and", "99:54", "interesting which is like well let's", "99:57", "look at us we got three white guys in", "100:00", "here there's Jamie you and me sake speak", "100:02", "to yourself I'm 1.6 percent African I", "100:04", "did recognize that I knew who was good I", "100:06", "knew he was gonna play that card but you", "100:09", "sir can pass his white right yes okay", "100:12", "now in order to have the objection like", "100:17", "there's some little bit of guilt which", "100:20", "is like well why aren't there any people", "100:21", "from Cambodia in here is that that we're", "100:23", "really anti Cambodian if you carry that",

have to listen to that voice and I", "100:47", "think this is really important that is", "100:50", "not a voice that needs to be answered", "100:52", "it's not a voice that needs to be taken",

for them", "101:21", "they're trying to engineer a more fair", "101:23", "and balanced society if I was going to", "101:25", "take their perspective they would say", "101:26", "that the reason why there aren't more", "101:28", "women in science or trans people in", "101:31", "science or you know I'm also trying to", "101:33", "engineer a world where there are more", "101:35", "women in science how are you doing that", "101:37", "by trying to figure out what is it", "101:39", "that's selecting against women for", "101:41", "example that we need to get women more", "101:44", "money as I said

yeah but a lot of women don't", "101:57", "find that attractive they don't want to", "101:58", "do that maybe but I'm trying to think", "102:01", "that my point is is that there are lots", "102:04", "of reasons that men and women are", "102:06", "different right yeah so for example I", "102:09", "saw a beautiful video of a guy who jumps", "102:12", "down an enormous flight of stairs on a", "102:14", "skateboard and he just nailed the", "102:16", "landing and it's just a that's a thing", "102:17", "of art and then it shows you 150", "102:22", "attempts where this guy just abused his",

you didn't show me that this", "102:37", "guy was willing to put his brain his", "102:39", "life on the", "102:40", "in order to nail that trick and he's", "102:43", "actually one of the world's falling", "102:44", "champions right mm-hmm okay well when", "102:48", "you start saying well why are you", "102:49", "putting this video of this person who's", "102:51", "doing this thing you know on the", "102:53", "internet because that person belongs to", "102:55", "a privileged class I'm saying well I", "102:56", "don't know that guy", "102:59", "abused himself and put himself at risk",

that keeps them out and it might be", "103:59", "more that they're just not that", "104:01", "interested in that well that they're", "104:03", "also biologically Bennet that's been", "104:05", "proven in studies but I'm trying to make", "104:07", "it a different point right okay to me", "104:09", "what I'm trying to say is I made a", "104:12", "mistake years ago I think of engaging", "104:15", "and answering this point which is you", "104:19", "know let's it let's take piano", "104:21", "competitions why our piano competitions", "104:23", "historically disproportionately you know", "104:26",
