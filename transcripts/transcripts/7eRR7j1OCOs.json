    "all the time you can with many things",
    "33:12",

    "33:13",
    "confused is that a fact i mean",

    "money but no one you know that",
    "84:12",
    "well don't you think that in a way well",
    "84:14",
    "i guess it's not really",
    "84:16",
    "comparable i was talking about the apple",
    "84:18",
    "algorithm they use for podcasts where",
    "84:20",
    "the new",
    "84:21",
    "it's probably similar a little bit",
    "84:23",
    "because the way you first started yeah",
    "84:24",
    "they think you'll",
    "84:25",
    "just shoot you up to the top so you can",
    "84:26",
    "like um we have the most successful",
    "84:28",
    "podcast we just started that's that's",
    "84:30",
    "amazing yeah let's keep at this thing",
    "84:31",
    "yes and then once the algorithm it's a",
    "84:33",
    "weird algorithm like it tricks you",
    "84:35",
    "because if you have a new podcast what",
    "84:37",
    "are the what are the specifics do we",
    "84:39",
    "know the specifics",
    "84:40",
    "no one knows so it's just guessing",
    "84:41",
    "guessing for sure trying things out to",
    "84:43",
    "figure out like this actually works",
    "84:45",
    "it's funny how people like like apple",
    "84:48",
    "and and also",
    "84:50",

    "are what",
    "84:57",
    "number of people are viewing things it",
    "84:58",
    "doesn't say it like a youtube clip does",
    "85:00",
    "you have to kind of guess they they know",
    "85:02",
    "but they don't tell anybody",
    "85:03",
    "but it's kind of the same thing in a way",
    "85:06",
    "yeah i mean",
    "85:06",
    "i've seen people say like the nba",
    "85:08",

    "then check the ratings and see where",
    "85:20",
    "they're at but it's just uh",
    "85:23",
    "it's interesting to me when you have no",
    "85:25",
    "idea what the algorithm is whether it's",
    "85:26",
    "the uh",
    "85:27",
    "itunes podcast algorithm or netflix's",
    "85:30",

    "85:31",
    "don't",
    "85:32",

    "126:38",
    "but when you write it down and just",
    "126:40",

    "that because there's no tone no context",
    "126:43",
    "yeah",
    "126:44",

    "trying to deny",
    "126:58",

    "129:57",
    "slow but do you think that when you get",

    "to a point like that",
    "130:00",
    "interpreter at the uh concert you get",
    "130:03",
    "that good at sign language",
    "130:04",
    "you could communicate as clearly yeah",
    "130:06",
    "but it's the same as any language where",
    "130:09",
    "it's like i might be like what's up",
    "130:10",
    "y'all it's lit",
    "130:11",
    "and you might be like oh i'm older i",

    "130:28",
    "part like if if you go to a different",
    "130:29",
    "state sometimes the way that people",

    "speak in maybe like in texas in certain",
    "130:33",
    "rural parts you wouldn't really",
    "130:34",
    "understand certain things that they say",
    "130:36",
    "or how they say them",
    "130:37",
    "so it's the same with sign language like",
    "130:39",
    "you can say doctor like this",
    "130:40",
    "or like this but if you're learning and",
    "130:43",
    "you only know this way to say it then if",
    "130:45",
    "someone does that you're like what the",
    "130:46",

    "there be different like not asl",
    "131:04",
    "because that's i didn't once i learned",
    "131:06",
    "american sign language i was like wait a",
    "131:07",
    "second",
    "131:09",
    "your french sign language yeah spanish",
    "131:11",
    "language",
    "131:12",
    "oh that's amazing language like how much",
    "131:15",
    "different is it",
    "131:16",
    "it's very different it's very different",
    "131:18",
    "so if you went over there",
    "131:19",
    "like you don't even know the language no",
    "131:21",
    "oh you fucks you had the one chance to",
    "131:23",
    "make universal language i know",
    "131:26",
    "it's so fascinating i'm like very",
    "131:29",
    "interested in like",
    "131:30",
    "the deaf community and sign language and",
    "131:31",
    "all of that linguistics",
    "131:33",
    "i got super high once i think it was in",
    "131:35",
    "the tank",
    "131:36",
    "and when i came out i had this idea that",
    "131:39",
    "alien",
    "131:39",
    "life if it wanted to communicate with us",
    "131:43",
    "would come up with a way like a type of",
    "131:47",
    "language",
    "131:48",
    "that everyone could understand like a",
    "131:50",
    "language that got right into your",
    "131:52",
    "brain a language that instead of you",
    "131:54",
    "having to interpret what the sounds mean",
    "131:56",
    "and turn them into words it's some new",
    "131:58",
    "kind of technology",
    "131:59",
    "that allow like as they're making this",
    "132:01",
    "sound as they're putting out the signal",
    "132:03",
    "it's going straight into you",
    "132:05",
    "and you automatically understand it yeah",
    "132:07",
    "without knowing what they're saying",
    "132:09",
    "without having actual",
    "132:10",
    "bob said you guys should come to the",
    "132:12",
    "spaceship instead of seeing",
    "132:13",
    "you know what it means without having",
    "132:16",
    "hearing sound like you'll have to",
    "132:17",
    "disassociate the idea of",
    "132:19",
    "these sounds meaning these words you'll",
    "132:21",
    "just know what it means",
    "132:22",
    "yeah the movie yeah oh that movie rivals",
    "132:26",
    "didn't they do it like visually yeah it",
    "132:27",

    "right there's no sentence it was all",
    "132:30",
    "memes and like right",
    "132:32",
    "it was like they would spray black ink",
    "132:35",
    "into the sky right what did they do for",
    "132:36",
    "length let me see what it looked like",
    "132:38",
    "again yeah there it goes they splay",
    "132:40",
    "spray black ink and it makes like weird",
    "132:42",
    "patterns",
    "132:43",
    "and that's how they um would communicate",
    "132:45",
    "does that make sense",
    "132:47",
    "yeah have you seen that new the trailer",
    "132:49",

    "it up",
    "132:56",
    "i think there's a guy named ray kurzweil",

    "genius guy and i got a chance to",
    "133:10",
    "interview him once a way back",
    "133:12",
    "but one of the things that we talked",
    "133:13",
    "about was he was talking about",
    "133:16",
    "downloading consciousness into a",
    "133:18",
    "computer",
    "133:19",
    "and they think that there's going to",
    "133:20",
    "come a point in time where you will be",
    "133:22",
    "eternal because you're going to",
    "133:24",
    "figure out a way to take whoever ally",
    "133:26",
    "mikowski is",
    "133:27",
    "and put it in a computer and download it",
    "133:29",
    "and your material body your physical",
    "133:30",
    "body",
    "133:31",
    "your biological body won't mean anything",
    "133:33",
    "anymore you're going to exist",
    "133:35",
    "as you inside this this computer",
    "133:38",
    "inside this thing i've always thought",
    "133:41",
    "that",
    "133:42",
    "that's probably what alien life is",
    "133:45",
    "what alien life is is something that has",
    "133:47",
    "gotten to the point where it doesn't",
    "133:48",
    "need a physical form anymore",
    "133:50",
    "like whatever consciousness is they",
    "133:52",
    "figured out a way to contain it in",
    "133:54",
    "non-biological systems so they take",
    "133:56",
    "whatever you are when you're born and",
    "133:58",
    "they but then the thing is like how does",
    "133:59",
    "that thing",
    "134:00",
    "replicate what are they doing to make it",
    "134:02",
    "what are they doing",
    "134:03",
    "how what are they doing to make sure the",
    "134:05",
    "power stays on like what are they doing",
    "134:07",
    "i think keto probably squats i think",
    "134:11",
    "life could be all kinds of shapes",
    "134:14",
    "i think life could be like there was",
    "134:16",
    "some speculations these scientists were",
    "134:17",
    "trying to figure out whether or not",
    "134:18",
    "light",
    "134:19",
    "could be a life form like there could be",
    "134:21",
    "a forms of life",
    "134:23",
    "that or made entirely of light well",
    "134:26",
    "everything's energy right",
    "134:28",
    "i don't know if everything's energy i",
    "134:29",
    "don't know i thought i'd throw that out",
    "134:31",
    "it really makes sense",
    "134:32",
    "just really lazy but like we're made of",
    "134:35",
    "energy you know",
    "134:36",
    "um yeah we're made of energy but what",
    "134:39",
    "would we think of as life",
    "134:40",
    "we think of as like a frog yeah or like",
    "134:42",
    "uh an ally makovsky or",
    "134:44",
    "jamie yeah but it's possible that life",
    "134:47",
    "might be",
    "134:48",
    "like i thought about ideas like when you",
    "134:50",
    "have an idea and then that idea gets in",
    "134:52",
    "your head like man i don't like that",
    "134:53",
    "idea",
    "134:54",
    "and then you you start working to",
    "134:56",
    "fulfill that idea you build a thing like",
    "134:58",
    "maybe you have an idea like how to build",
    "135:00",
    "a thing",
    "135:00",
    "and then you build a thing like that's a",
    "135:02",
    "thing that like",
    "135:03",
    "forced you to make it it's like",
    "135:06",
    "you had an idea that yeah bumped jumped",
    "135:09",
    "into your brain",
    "135:10",
    "and then it's like listen bitch you need",
    "135:12",
    "to make a canoe like a canoe",
    "135:14",
    "yeah how would i make a canoe you take a",
    "135:15",
    "log you fucking hollow out the side you",
    "135:17",
    "roll around inside of it",
    "135:18",
    "just go down the river and then all of a",
    "135:20",
    "sudden this idea that pops into your",
    "135:22",
    "head",
    "135:22",
    "and you start doing all the work now you",
    "135:23",
    "have a physical thing that literally",
    "135:26",
    "allowed itself to be born by getting",
    "135:29",
    "this idea that invades your",
    "135:30",
    "consciousness",
    "135:31",
    "and tricks you into making things",
    "135:33",
    "doesn't that make you think that",
    "135:35",
    "everything's already kind of decided",
    "135:36",
    "like",
    "135:37",
    "you know you have free will and control",
    "135:40",
    "but",
    "135:40",
    "to some extent everything's kind of",
    "135:42",
    "already what's gonna happen is gonna",
    "135:44",
    "happen",
    "135:45",
    "that's not necessarily true i think you",
    "135:47",
    "do have free will but i think you",
    "135:48",
    "also have determinism i think",
    "135:52",
    "this is something that people have",
    "135:53",
    "argued successfully where you",
    "135:56",
    "you really have to take a step back and",
    "135:57",
    "go okay what do i think about a person's",
    "136:00",
    "who a person is right now like if i meet",
    "136:02",
    "a person and uh i meet this woman and",

    "doesn't know what she's doing with her",
    "136:09",
    "life and she cries",
    "136:10",
    "like uh oh get your shit together bitch",
    "136:13",
    "is that what you think like how",
    "136:14",
    "what what do you think when you meet a",
    "136:15",
    "person like that do you take any",
    "136:17",
    "consideration like oh this is a person",
    "136:18",
    "who is the",
    "136:20",
    "granddaughter of alcoholics and it all",
    "136:23",
    "boiled down to genetics and terrible so",
    "136:26",
    "all of her systems that came online when",
    "136:28",
    "she was two",
    "136:29",
    "and five and six they all came online",
    "136:31",
    "during alcoholic households and people",
    "136:33",
    "were physically abusive and you're",
    "136:35",
    "hiding in the corner of your bedroom and",
    "136:37",
    "it was all chaos",
    "136:39",
    "drinking when you're 12 like when you",
    "136:42",
    "get to that",
    "136:44",
    "35 year old person and they've gone",
    "136:46",
    "through this",
    "136:47",
    "insane pattern without any intervention",
    "136:49",
    "nothing nothing switch",
    "136:50",
    "how much of their life are they really",
    "136:52",
    "responsible for yeah it's a real",
    "136:53",
    "question",
    "136:54",
    "it's like who are you you are the",
    "136:56",
    "combination of all the things that have",
    "136:58",
    "ever happened to you",
    "136:59",
    "your genetics all the weird shit that",
    "137:02",
    "you inherit from your parents",
    "137:03",
    "you inherit a lot of ideas they think",
    "137:05",
    "even from your parents",
    "137:06",
    "not just like learn from them but",
    "137:08",
    "actually inherit these ideas",
    "137:10",
    "and then you do the best with what you",
    "137:13",
    "got yeah",
    "137:14",
    "and some people's got is fucking",
    "137:16",
    "terrible",
    "137:18",
    "yeah do you think we're living in a",
    "137:19",
    "simulation",
    "137:21",
    "i'm too dumb same to",
    "137:25",
    "to take that into consideration but i",
    "137:27",
    "think it seems um",
    "137:28",
    "legitimately weird it does it",
    "137:32",
    "seems like it changes too much",
    "137:35",
    "like reality itself changes too much",
    "137:38",
    "yeah",
    "137:39",
    "and things come up that seem like if",
    "137:41",
    "there was going to be a simulation",
    "137:44",
    "this is how it would go down like like i",
    "137:47",
    "remember when i first started reading",
    "137:48",
    "about simulation theory was right around",
    "137:50",
    "the time where uh anthony weiner",
    "137:52",
    "got busted for sending pictures of his",
    "137:55",
    "deck like what are the odds",
    "137:56",
    "yeah like that seems like it's so on the",
    "137:59",
    "nose it seems like somebody's",
    "138:01",
    "if your name was wiener you'd avoid",
    "138:03",
    "showing people your heart yeah",
    "138:04",
    "like this is your turn castrate yourself",
    "138:07",
    "no more weiner",
    "138:09",
    "but if we're going to come up with one",
    "138:10",
    "someday obviously not you and me but",
    "138:12",
    "someone really smart it's going to come",
    "138:13",
    "up with a simulation",
    "138:15",
    "it's going to eventually get good enough",
    "138:16",
    "where you can't tell that you're in the",
    "138:18",
    "simulation",
    "138:19",
    "that's all fucked up that's what's",
    "138:20",
    "fucked up what's fucked up is it",
    "138:22",
    "if it isn't here it's coming yeah this",
    "138:25",
    "took me a long time",
    "138:26",
    "like i had a conversation with this guy",
    "138:28",
    "nick balstrom who's a",
    "138:30",
    "brilliant guy who is a big proponent of",
    "138:35",
    "this concept and he he was explaining it",
    "138:38",
    "through like probability theory yeah i",
    "138:41",
    "was a little too dumb to understand what",
    "138:42",
    "he was saying but",
    "138:43",
    "basically that's how you're listening to",
    "138:44",
    "your podcast if you do if",
    "138:46",
    "if it's possible that someday someone",
    "138:48",
    "essentially i'm i'm",
    "138:49",
    "paraphrasing someday we'll have a",
    "138:52",
    "simulation",
    "138:53",
    "like how what are the odds that this is",
    "138:55",
    "simulated it's more likely",
    "138:57",
    "that this is a simulation than not yeah",
    "139:00",
    "you just got to pray that whoever's",
    "139:02",
    "doing the simulation is looking out for",
    "139:03",
    "you",
    "139:05",
    "the other possibility is that we know",
    "139:06",
    "the simulation's coming",
    "139:08",
    "that's the other possibility and that's",
    "139:09",
    "why everybody's freaked out everybody's",
    "139:11",
    "freaked out because even",
    "139:12",
    "though it's not here it's inevitable if",
    "139:14",
    "you follow the pattern",
    "139:15",
    "of innovation if you go from pioneers",

    "that we're in the simulation when it",

    "happens",
    "139:41",

    "trying to recreate",
    "142:15",
    "what we're trying to get to could be",

    "focused on",
    "142:41",
    "like not to sound like russell brand but",
    "142:43",
    "like if we all just like",

    "took time to like meditate and like get",
    "142:46",
    "in contact with ourselves and like",

    "potentially have that like",
    "142:55",
    "well that would definitely help yeah and",
    "142:56",
    "this is the other thing about people",
    "142:58",
    "that are like angry all the time or",
    "142:59",
    "people that are lashing out at people",
    "143:00",

    "go into you and go",
    "143:28",
    "maybe for a second i don't know how long",
    "143:30",

    "strong-willed or minded you are",
    "143:34",
    "you're going to attach part of that to",

    "if you call them an asshole they just",
    "143:42",
    "become more of an asshole i think that",
    "143:44",
    "might be the case with trump",
    "143:45",
    "i think if you look at who he was before",
    "143:48",
    "he became president and like how um",
    "143:50",
    "antagonistic he is like now that he is",
    "143:52",
    "president i mean there was some of that",
    "143:53",
    "before like when you",
    "143:54",
    "get mad at rosie o'donnell or someone",
    "143:56",
    "and insult people",
    "143:58",
    "but it seems like now it's like way more",

    "prevalent",
    "144:02",
    "in his behavior yeah i think a lot of",
    "144:03",
    "that is probably",
    "144:05",
    "connected to the fact that so many",
    "144:06",
    "people fucking hate him and they're",
    "144:07",
    "criticizing him",
    "144:08",
    "like his last days if you think about",
    "144:11",
    "who he is right he's 75 years old or",
    "144:13",
    "something like that",
    "144:14",
    "right he's so hot how old is he",
    "144:20",
    "somebody must think he's hot for sure",

    "for sure for sure",
    "144:25",
    "just turned 74. do you think melania no",

    "such a weird age to have a president but",
    "144:40",
    "it but it",
    "144:40",
    "makes sense because then you learn a lot",
    "144:42",
    "from life but what i was going to say is",
    "144:45",
    "you generally you don't live to be much",
    "144:48",
    "older than 90.",
    "144:50",
    "most people that's so the last years",

    "before that he's in rap songs",
    "144:55",
    "everybody's like he's got his own",
    "144:56",
    "show on nbc you're fired yeah everybody",

    "fires people",
    "145:01",

    "the united states",
    "145:19",
    "you want to be that one person that",
    "145:20",
    "dictates policy could literally change",

    "the way",
    "145:23",
    "our society functions you have this",
    "145:26",
    "weird power",
    "145:26",
    "where if your friends go to jail you",
    "145:28",
    "could exonerate them ally",
    "145:30",
    "i'm gonna let you out i'm gonna give you",

    "a presidential pardon we still have",

    "presidential pardons",
    "145:34",
    "crazy like a person could just decide",

    "they're the president so they get to do",
    "145:38",
    "it",
    "145:38",
    "like we let this medieval shit exist in",
    "145:41",
    "2020 where you could just decide",
    "145:42",
    "and i feel like most presidents don't do",
    "145:44",
    "much well they do a lot with it",
    "145:46",
    "really oh yes they do they pardon",
    "145:49",
    "hundreds of people there's so many",
    "145:51",
    "people in jail who don't need to be",
    "145:53",
    "that's true yeah well that's where",
    "145:55",
    "people like the innocence project and uh",
    "145:57",
    "these guys on my show yeah yeah yeah um",
    "146:01",
    "did you ever get into serial that",
    "146:03",
    "podcast about a non",
    "146:04",
    "cyan",
    "146:08",
    "it was like a super popular podcast",
    "146:09",
    "about this girl who was murdered",
    "146:12",
    "and they put her boyfriend in jail but",
    "146:15",
    "the story it's like",
    "146:17",
    "the podcast is them going into the story",
    "146:19",
    "and all the details and",
    "146:20",
    "uh and it's just interesting hearing",

    "she was innocent i don't know that's up",
    "146:26",
    "to",
    "146:27",
    "the audience to decide yeah that's again",
    "146:29",
    "but he was like he was 17.",
    "146:31",
    "so i don't know part of me wants to be",
    "146:34",
    "i'm very naive and young and somewhat",
    "146:37",
    "dumb for the most part",
    "146:38",
    "and so there's part of me that's like",
    "146:41",
    "but if he did do it",
    "146:42",
    "right if he did murder his ex-girlfriend",
    "146:45",
    "and he was 17",
    "146:47",
    "and he's in jail for life no option of",
    "146:49",
    "parole at this point",
    "146:51",
    "and it's like don't i feel like prison",
    "146:54",
    "system should be able to have like a",
    "146:56",
    "rehabilitation process so that way",
    "146:58",
    "someone like him who might not",
    "147:00",
    "be a guy if even if he did it he's not",
    "147:02",
    "going to do it again",
    "147:03",
    "it's like do you know what i mean let me",
    "147:06",
    "take a breath",
    "147:09",
    "what are you trying to say if",
    "147:12",
    "if you go to jail for murder but you're",
    "147:13",
    "not the type of person who's like",
    "147:16",
    "you're not like a serial murderer you're",
    "147:18",
    "just like he was in high school maybe he",
    "147:20",
    "was misguided by his friends",
    "147:21",
    "he didn't know what to do ex-girlfriend",
    "147:23",
    "yeah um",
    "147:25",
    "diddy i don't know so there's two things",
    "147:27",
    "possible one",
    "147:28",
    "that's the thing if you kill your",
    "147:30",
    "girlfriend i think you forfeit your life",
    "147:32",
    "sure because if we don't have",
    "147:34",
    "unbelievably",
    "147:35",
    "strict rules like that yeah you're gonna",
    "147:38",
    "have people doing that more often yeah",
    "147:39",
    "there's",
    "147:40",
    "there is something that is a",
    "147:44",
    "there's something that influences people",
    "147:46",
    "to be good",
    "147:47",
    "and most of it is being a good person is",
    "147:49",
    "like feels good but part of it is",
    "147:50",
    "punishment",
    "147:51",
    "yeah part of his punitive stuff you can",
    "147:53",
    "think for life but here's the thing",
    "147:55",
    "you don't let me finish my sentence",
    "147:56",
    "because this is the most important part",
    "147:58",
    "we'd have to know for sure you did it",
    "148:00",
    "and i don't think they do that now so",
    "148:02",
    "that",
    "148:02",
    "that's one of the real problems we have",
    "148:04",
    "and then once you get into the system",
    "148:06",
    "even if they know you're innocent it",
    "148:07",
    "takes months sometimes before you get",
    "148:09",
    "out",
    "148:09",
    "right even if you have an appeal like",
    "148:11",
    "there's a lot going on there and that's",
    "148:13",
    "kind of the thing",
    "148:14",
    "that's the thing it's like you i think",
    "148:16",
    "that if you",
    "148:17",
    "take someone's life like that you",
    "148:19",
    "forfeit your life but how do i know you",
    "148:21",
    "did it",
    "148:21",
    "exactly how do i absolutely know you did",
    "148:23",
    "it because i definitely know that people",
