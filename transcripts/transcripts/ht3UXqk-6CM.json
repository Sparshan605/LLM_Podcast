they're", "22:08", "going to build one of those so they take", "22:10", "that green shaft and straighten it the", "22:12", "next step is they find a wood called", "22:13", "bullet wood and they cut

is almost like", "22:30", "it's on a picture to having the", "22:31", "consistency of bamboo and they shove", "22:33", "that bullet wood in there and it causes", "22:35", "it forms like a base and to

long", "25:15", "bowstring and that's how you string your", "25:17", "bow so when they're shooting their bow", "25:19", "like what's a long shot for them like 15", "25:22", "20 yards long shot long shot and the", "25:25", "length of shot you're going to take sort", "25:26", "of depends on um kind of depends on well", "25:30", "they don't really think like the ideally", "25:33", "like the you gonna wounded it's going to", "25:35", "get away doesn't weigh on them very", "25:36", "heavily right like in our culture and", "25:40", "our hunting culture here we've come to", "25:42", "like really uh the wound loss is", "25:47", "something we do a lot to avoid okay", "25:49", "there's a lot of talk where I Samba", "25:51", "don't you know you shouldn't be", "25:53", "surprised to get a good hit you should", "25:55", "know what's going to happen don't take", "25:57", "shots that are too far away right we", "25:59", "really put a strong value on um when you", "26:03", "let the arrow go or when you let the", "26:04", "bullet go you damn sure know that you're", "26:07", "going to have a quick clean kill well at", "26:09", "least we put a lot of value on that in", "26:11", "practice sometimes that stuff goes out", "26:13", "the window but anyone would say that", "26:15", "that's your goal uh not on their mind", "26:18", "you seem take some Hail Marys", "26:20", "right", "26:21", "and they can shoot like if you're just", "26:23", "if you're trying to shoot a bird all", "26:25", "they're trying to do is get a warrior", "26:27", "point so one of those arrows I described", "26:30", "fitted with a long wire on the end cut", "26:33", "out of a piece of steel fence with a", "26:34", "barb", "26:35", "with a couple barbs filed into it and", "26:38", "that head is joined by string to the",

"26:53", "shaft and that allows the tangle up up", "26:55", "in the trees so when they shoot all they", "26:58", "really need to do is prick that thing", "27:00", "with that wire barb knowing that the", "27:03", "bird or they hunt for a large aquatic", "27:05", "rodents knowing that the bird is going", "27:08", "to get tangled up in the trees overhead", "27:10", "and that they can then climb up to go", "27:12", "get it even then I think even shooting", "27:17", "like that kind of thing were you just", "27:18", "trying to prick the thing 30 yards be", "27:20", "very long shooting fish you're not", "27:23", "shooting that I mean shooting fish", "27:24", "you're not really like bow fishing which", "27:26", "I've done a lot of in my life a 10 yard", "27:28", "bow fishing shot is very far yeah you're", "27:30", "right above them right yeah because", "27:32", "you're shooting down in the water now do", "27:33", "they have you have to judge when you're", "27:36", "shooting into the water you have to", "27:37", "judge differently right the way", "27:39", "diffraction unless that thing unless", "27:41", "that fish is sunning unless that fish is", "27:44", "sunning and it's back is at the surface", "27:46", "of breaking the surface uh you need to", "27:49", "account for refraction so you're aiming", "27:52", "way low now if you got a fish that's a", "27:54", "fish two feet below the water surface is", "27:56", "extremely hard to hit because it's so", "27:58", "deep you're aiming like you're aiming at", "28:01", "your boot I know why me that feels like", "28:03", "that you know you're aiming so low", "28:04", "there's there's an equation so is low", "28:06", "you're aiming way below the fish because", "28:09", "refraction like anyone's ever taken a", "28:10", "fishing pole stuck in the water right", "28:12", "right you see the yeah yeah it hooks so", "28:15", "that's like that's like the trick of bow", "28:16", "fishing but were they both fish for some", "28:19", "of the stuff my favorite thing the bow", "28:21", "fish down there is also you're also", "28:24", "dealing with current and there again", "28:26", "they're shooting a hollow arrow that", "28:28", "doesn't weigh shit it doesn't cut", "28:29", "through the water at all so they're", "28:32", "holding way low for refraction", "28:34", "and holding way upstream because their", "28:37", "arrow is so buoyant oh wow now an", "28:40", "American bow fishing rig which I shoot", "28:43", "has a fiberglass arrow so the current", "28:46", "isn't as much of an issue because that", "28:48", "arrow is so heavy that it can cut", "28:50", "through the water but refraction is the", "28:52", "same so that's why a point-blank shot", "28:56", "bow fishing is still very difficult and", "28:59", "then you got a factor that you still", "29:01", "need to hit the thing pretty good in a", "29:02", "place where the arrow is not going to", "29:04", "pop out there's a fish Sabo hunt for", "29:07", "that they use the bow hunt for for", "29:09", "salted fish called the arapaima and air", "29:13", "prime is the biggest freshwater fish in", "29:15", "the world well basically the sturgeon", "29:18", "yeah the largest freshwater fish the", "29:20", "largest okay the largest scaled yet an", "29:22", "arapaima is the largest scaled", "29:24", "freshwater fish how big is it", "29:27", "well I mean they'll get up into the", "29:28", "hundreds of pounds I've never heard of", "29:31", "it it looks like it's it's this scale", "29:34", "stir a are a Pai oh my god yeah that's", "29:38", "an arapaima Jesus Christ that looks", "29:41", "completely prehistoric they have a", "29:44", "bizarre relationship with these fish in", "29:46", "the Micucci do in guyana so that's", "29:50", "amazing I used to hunt I'm looking", "29:53", "critter they used to hunt him to export", "29:55", "the salted meat based on him to sell", "29:57", "salted meat to markets okay now uh one", "30:04", "of those is worth $7,000 to them alive", "30:06", "holy shit that's how much that's how", "30:08", "much a white guy will pay to catch one", "30:10", "and let it go oh my god yeah", "30:13", "oh so it's a guy by a month a guy will", "30:16", "pay more the Micucci will make more to", "30:20", "take a guy out to catch an arapaima and", "30:21", "let it go than what you'd pay to hunt", "30:23", "for elk in the US on a guided trip holy", "30:25", "shit they get seven grand to catch an", "30:28", "arapaima and when Rovin was a kid they", "30:32", "would go on to week hunting trips where", "30:38", "they're gone for two weeks with their", "30:40", "father they would go for two weeks to", "30:42", "hunt salt fish so they were if they were", "30:45", "operating out a dugout canoes that they", "30:47", "would have to paddle", "30:48", "and they would paddle it would make a", "30:49", "dugout canoe themselves paddle the", "30:52", "dugout canoe upriver for a week to get", "30:55", "to the good hunting and fishing grounds", "30:56", "then they would hunt and fish for one", "30:58", "week until they would get 100 pounds of", "31:02", "salted fish then you'd go back downriver", "31:06", "which would take a day or two days and", "31:08", "then get to the mouth of the Rupununi", "31:11", "River and paddle up the Rupununi River", "31:14", "for two days to another town and then", "31:18", "they would haul the salt fish including", "31:22", "arapaima flesh and sell that 100 pounds", "31:25", "of salted fish for 75 US dollars so 2", "31:30", "weeks plus work for a family for 75", "31:33", "dollars and now they will not touch", "31:36", "those fish because they make a handful", "31:39", "of people every year go down and give", "31:41", "them 7 grand to catch one let it go so 7", "31:44", "grand to them must be just an enormous", "31:46", "it's changed everything when I was", "31:48", "talking about like that they discovered", "31:49", "sunglasses shit there's been a lot like", "31:51", "they were already onto this air paya", "31:53", "thing the first thing I went down and", "31:54", "it's changed everything about it's", "31:56", "changed that village the arapaima", "31:58", "fishery the way they use the hunt", "32:00", "arapaima is there to hunt them out of", "32:01", "trees they would so you're familiar like", "32:04", "when a river you know a river flows in a", "32:06", "s pattern like a repeating essence now", "32:09", "and then uhm during high water a river", "32:12", "will jump one of the esses you picture", "32:15", "I'm saying yes so the river jumps an ass", "32:18", "and it abandoned in the main channel", "32:20", "abandons the curves of the s ok those", "32:24", "curves become what's called oxbow lakes", "32:26", "where during high water during a flood", "32:29", "those

"32:50", "they would climb up in trees overlooking", "32:54", "these places and wait for the arapaima", "32:56", "to come up near the surface and shoot it", "32:59", "with an arrow", "33:01", "there was a detachable basically the", "33:04", "harpoon head arrow and shoot it with the", "33:05", "arrow", "33:06", "the harpoon head would detached from the", "33:09", "arrow and the arrow would flow on

like when we're", "33:45", "out fishing there's salt and fish all", "33:46", "the time they would salt that fish and", "33:48", "then sell it and then that became an", "33:51", "endangered the other thing they would", "33:57", "hunt for is they would hunt for giant", "33:58", "river turtles and sell the meat and I'm", "34:01", "greatly depleted because their whole", "34:04", "lives occur on this

make money to buy", "34:48", "staples and run a school and stuff like", "34:50", "that it gives them kind of out and it's", "34:53", "funny because uh I'm a lot more", "34:56", "interested like personally I'm a lot", "34:59", "more interested in a guy shooting fish", "35:01", "off a tree and salting the meat than I", "35:03", "am a dude like me going down to catch an", "35:06", "arapaima and let it go so in some ways", "35:08", "it's sad yeah it's sad just because like", "35:12", "it's not say it's", "35:15", "right - they're saving the fishery but", "35:16", "you see like just it's sad to see shit", "35:18", "change man why did they let it go why", "35:20", "don't they give it to the people that", "35:21", "live there so they could use it for the", "35:23", "meat they let it go so they can catch it", "35:24", "again mm-hmm because they want to make", "35:26", "sure that the population stays yapping", "35:28", "so Rovin what here's the thing the", "35:30", "reason had one of those oxbow lakes got", "35:35", "lower and lower and lower and someone", "35:36", "real one of their got one of these", "35:38", "Micucci guys realized there's 26", "35:39", "arapaima stranded in an

just save a little", "35:51", "spot for himself okay", "35:53", "and a guy found them and they're all in", "35:55", "there but there's not enough water to", "35:57", "cover them up they can sip air is the", "35:59", "thing that makes them pewter so you can", "36:00", "always find arapaima because they come", "36:02", "up the goal bare Jesus yes the real air", "36:05", "and also a very loud noise they make", "36:08", "when they come up to gulp air so they", "36:10", "can live in low oxygen environments like", "36:13", "if you took most fish and threw them in", "36:15", "a stagnant Oxbow that's

praying or", "36:25", "their equivalent of praying that the", "36:27", "water level comes back up and liberate", "36:29", "them from the Ox boulders then these are", "36:32", "huge fish yeah Giants so they found 26", "36:34", "that were out of the water and their", "36:36", "backs were all messed up from birds and", "36:39", "other predators grabbing the aera trying", "36:41", "to grab the arapaima and then they went", "36:44", "and spent four days these are 26 air", "36:46", "primers between 50 inches and upper 80s", "36:49", "in length they spent four days moving", "36:54", "these 26 air

and", "105:46", "that they were trained soldiers with", "105:48", "discipline that there was just one prong", "105:50", "of a three-year you know three prong", "105:52", "attack or two-prong attack he's riding", "105:55", "in the one end of the village but he", "105:56", "just rode into the village and they were", "105:59", "just", "106:00", "right and in depicting popular", "106:03",

"106:11", "with long hair when in fact he had short", "106:13", "hair time but uh some people think that", "106:16", "when in looking at it he probably yet", "106:20", "the great one is here fell Custer great", "106:24", "image that like Jamie just pulled up a", "106:26", "crazy picture so here fell costs at a", "106:29", "contemporary picture did say what no no", "106:31", "that's the old classic there's one that", "106:33", "was on the anti corporate to the time", "106:36", "yeah here fell cost was a little bit", "106:38", "later but then the one that was the", "106:40",

"106:47", "fell coaster Wow which is is considered", "106:50", "to be a very accurate was compared to be", "106:53", "a pretty accurate depiction of what was", "106:56", "going on now the Nate Austin diverged", "106:58", "also dot Custer died early they think he", "107:00", "died earlier in the skirmish she wasn't", "107:02", "like the land movies he's got the", "107:04", "flowing blonde hair everyone's dead and", "107:06", "he's still firing away for he is he's", "107:09", "probably killed earlier rather than", "107:11", "later in the skirmish it's so funny", "107:13", "because see right there that he's like", "107:15", "you know yeah different position it's so", "107:20", "funny that that we've done that you know", "107:22", "that people have taken what they know", "107:25", "most likely we're historically", "107:26", "inaccurate accounts and they pass them", "107:29", "down generation and generation it makes", "107:30", "you wonder like this is what we know now", "107:32", "because this is only a hundred so years", "107:34", "ago yeah like what you know what are we", "107:37", "getting when we're getting some version", "107:39", "of something that happened a thousand", "107:40", "years ago or 9,000 years ago you know", "107:42", "yeah how distorted insanely yeah but the", "107:46", "problem we have as the culture I think", "107:48", "is when someone goes to fix when someone", "107:52", "goes to challenge our popular", "107:55", "perceptions um it's it's branded as", "108:00", "revisionist and somehow like loses right", "108:04", "it becomes almost like it's credentials", "108:07", "are tarnished remember the guy I can't", "108:10", "marry what politician Jamie bill pulled", "108:11", "out there's a politician who said um", "108:13", "he famously said you

guy was a first-hand", "109:08", "account of what and we're supposed to", "109:09", "believe I mean who knows how much of", "109:12", "what he's saying is accurate but if any", "109:14", "of it is accurate Columbus was a fuckin", "109:16", "monster yeah I think that what it stems", "109:18", "from is that from the perspective in", "109:22", "Europe at the time he had he had", "109:28", "solidified and put some shit together", "109:30", "the people had been kind of pecking", "109:31", "around the edges of right whether it's", "109:33", "continent existed and in in in yeah just", "109:37", "had it was like a leap forward at the", "109:40", "time yeah how crazy is that but the fact", "109:42", "that it becomes that all right to he", "109:47", "like you know that in some people's", "109:49", "minds like somehow established America", "109:52", "yeah and that we take a day off of", "109:54", "school because of it that's really crazy", "109:56", "this bizarre Columbus Day I mean we", "109:59", "still to this day in 2017 kids get", "110:01", "Columbus Day Off don't they but now it's", "110:04", "like here's the thing now that no one", "110:07", "now that not that sort of the consensus", "110:11", "right the popular consensus is that he", "110:15", "was a one of many players involved and", "110:20", "sort of putting together what was here", "110:23", "and sort
