it's", "06:28", "ready for impact from the front or from", "06:30", "the side because you're used to it well", "06:31", "if you can see the punch coming the", "06:33", "behind I always tell people just do with", "06:35", "the palms just do this to the back of", "06:37", "your head and see what happens like just", "06:39", "me doing this it's already go", "06:40", "you're not ready for that so you know", "06:42", "what you imagine if you go hit as hard", "06:45", "as you can behind it here it's a sweet", "06:49", "it's a sweet punch I can't understand", "06:51", "nobody's doing it right
