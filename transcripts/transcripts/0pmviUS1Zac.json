to a slightly other kind of", "00:55", "dimension as you gaze upon them it's", "00:58", "more than what was actually going on at", "01:00", "the time and that's that's art taken to", "01:03", "the

it's not going to change the", "15:16", "water level so it's why you can do this", "15:19", "experiment it's really cool fill up your", "15:20", "glass put some few cubes of ice in a", "15:23", "glass of water fill the glass up as much", "15:26", "as you possibly can without spilling it", "15:28", "and the", "15:28", "ice is bobbing above that level okay", "15:31", "because ice is about 10% buoyant on that", "15:33", "about 10 percent of an ice cube will be", "15:35", "lifted above this is this is the this is", "15:37", "the iceberg equation right all right", "15:39", "that's the tip of the iceberg well you", "15:41", "see the 10% above and 90% is not visible", "15:44", "to you this is by the way I don't want", "15:46", "to get to too many off-ramps here but", "15:48", "that's one of the one of the things that", "15:49", "they did right in Titanic okay if you", "15:52", "look at the earliest Titanic movie that", "15:54", "was in black and white they see this", "15:56", "huge iceberg on the horizon and then it", "15:58", "can they can't square away from it", "16:00", "because it oh my gosh it doesn't have to", "16:02", "no no", "16:03", "the iceberg that cuts the bottom of your", "16:06", "boat is a little bit I sticking out", "16:08", "above the water because 90% of it is", "16:10", "underwater and that's where the damage", "16:11", "occurs and in the James Cameron Titanic", "16:15", "the iceberg that they hit above water", "16:18", "was looks like a little chunk of ice no", "16:20", "that couldn't hurt anything all the", "16:22", "damage was under work anyhow so back to", "16:24", "this so do this experiment and then let", "16:26", "the glass sit there and let the ice melt", "16:27", "and the water level will stay the same", "16:31", "because when ice melts it gets takes up", "16:34", "lower volume than it was when it became", "16:36", "ice mmm and that's why pipes break I", "16:39", "thought pipes break just because the", "16:42", "water expands yeah I just described that", "16:44", "in the opposite direction oh I didn't", "16:48", "know it gets larger that's what", "16:50", "expansion means what kind of with your", "16:52", "vocabulary here right now but I'm saying", "16:54", "like so your ice cube is sitting at 10%", "16:57", "of your ice cube is sitting 10% above", "16:59", "the water level and it melts and becomes", "17:00", "water the water takes up 90% of the", "17:04", "volume of the ice right so that just", "17:06", "melts back into the water and it doesn't", "17:08", "overflow even though we're sticking", "17:10", "above the water line when you had the", "17:11", "glass so now let's do the opposite okay", "17:14", "there's water in the pipes well can I", "17:16", "tell you something that might blow your", "17:17", "mind no how many times does your mind", "17:23", "you at least once a day yeah at least we", "17:25", "need your mind blown okay here's how it", "17:27", "works okay so let's put water in the", "17:30", "pipes okay and then the temperature", "17:34", "drops the pipes have a certain strength", "17:36", "right copper pipes you know they're", "17:39", "rigid and I grew up around Bray", "17:41", "and pipes okay so no Massachusetts so", "17:43", "the waters in there and now the", "17:45", "temperature begins to drop okay", "17:49", "the water wants to turn to ice but it", "17:54", "can't because the pipe is containing it", "17:59", "so it just sits there okay at 32 degrees", "18:03", "as water even though the temperature", "18:05", "outside is dropping below 32 degrees", "18:08", "okay and it still sits there guess the", "18:12", "30 degrees 29 the pipe is squeezing the", "18:17", "attempt of this water to become ice and", "18:20", "the act of squeezing it prevents the", "18:22",

"outside temperature continued it gets to", "18:32", "now 25 degrees the pipe is still holding", "18:35", "on to the liquid water and it's still 32", "18:38", "degrees inside there and it olds on to", "18:40", "it and this keeps happening it keeps", "18:42", "having you get a point where the pipe", "18:44", "can no longer contain the water and the", "18:48", "water freezes spontaneously it just goes", "18:53", "right down to that temperature and the", "18:55", "pipe is helpless in the face of this so", "18:59", "the point is the stronger the pipe is", "19:00", "the lower the temperature has to be", "19:03", "outside for the freezing water to break", "19:06", "so theoretically if you had a pipe that", "19:07", "was made of a stronger material than", "19:09", "copper you can get even lower than you", "19:10", "get even lower temperatures how low can", "19:12", "you get I cuz that when things freeze", "19:16", "they have to expand so what not only", "19:18", "when water freezes water expand when", "19:20", "it's it's it's a it's a remarkable fact", "19:23", "about water that is shared by very few", "19:25", "other ingredients most things when they", "19:26", "cool they shrink as all men know so so", "19:34", "so most most materials because things", "19:37", "cooler the vibrating molecules slow down", "19:40", "and they take up less space water is the", "19:42", "opposite of that as it passes down", "19:45", "through so so I'm gonna describe to you", "19:48", "an extraordinary fact about water and", "19:50", "why we're alive today okay so watch this", "19:52", "let's take a lake that has fish in it", "19:54", "okay", "19:55", "temperature drops outside and the lake", "19:57", "slowly begins to get cooler because", "19:59", "there's a tank time lag between the air", "20:01", "temperature and the waters that's why", "20:03", "the first freeze the lake is still there", "20:05", "it's got to be cold longer alright so", "20:07", "what happens the water gets cold on the", "20:09", "surface okay and it begins to okay the", "20:18", "water gets cold on a surface and it", "20:20", "begins to shrink so that water falls", "20:22", "this shrink that makes a denser it falls", "20:24", "to the bottom fine it does that down to", "20:27", "about four degrees Celsius as it goes", "20:30", "from 43 Celsius to zero degrees Celsius", "20:32", "the freezing point it begins to expand", "20:35", "and become less dense than the water so", "20:39", "now as the water wants to actually", "20:41", "freeze it stays on top when it does", "20:46", "freeze you freeze the top surface of the", "20:48", "lake well how about the water below it", "20:50", "it's insulated from the dropping air", "20:53", "temperature and the fish don't die", "20:56", "imagine if ice were denser than water", "20:59", "what would happen you'd freeze the top", "21:00", "layer it would sink the bottom is frozen", "21:02", "freeze the next layer it sinks and fish", "21:04", "would be systematically forced to swim", "21:07", "in shallower and shallower waters until", "21:10", "they were all freeze dried on the top", "21:13", "surface of the lake and all fishes would", "21:17", "be dead every winter I think it's every", "21:20", "Lake things fish what I think you", "21:22", "supposed to say fishes fishes is a", "21:24", "double plural you could do that yeah you", "21:26", "know fish would be dead you know I'm all", "21:28", "deer would you say all deers", "21:30", "well because generally it's one if you", "21:31", "had multiple kinds of deer yeah so if", "21:34", "you had like yeah but it's rare that", "21:37", "they're all in the same place you", "21:38", "generally have one kind of do normally", "21:39", "but if the ocean has many kind of fish", "21:40", "in the same place oh yeah that's", "21:43", "interesting so you'd say fishes fishes", "21:44", "it's like it's a double floor it's", "21:46", "different kinds of plural fish yeah", "21:49", "double blow my mind the many fishes in", "21:55", "the oh yeah yeah yeah so sorry she's in", "21:57", "the sea yeah so multiple plurals of", "22:00", "different have to get we're ocean water", "22:02", "freezes salty salt water do you have the", "22:04", "word fishes up there some weird anomaly", "22:06", "that happened where there was two or", "22:09", "little oxygen in the water and somehow", "22:11", "the frozen fish got pushed out in a wall", "22:13", "of ice South Dakota so there's too", "22:18", "little oxygen I don't know I can't", "22:20", "explain that over there if you look at", "22:22", "the if you look at the green in the", "22:24", "water most likely it's algae so that", "22:26", "happens with certain lakes that get", "22:27", "polluted with certain types of a you can", "22:29", "kill the lake but by doing that well you", "22:32", "get it in the ocean to get these zones", "22:33", "but I don't see how you get frozen fish", "22:34", "though that's incredible but stop go", "22:38", "back up yeah scroll down so we could", "22:40", "read it fish frozen a wall of ice and", "22:43", "South Dakota's Lake Andes National", "22:45", "Wildlife Refuge that's incredible man is", "22:48", "that a video Jaime", "22:49", "yeah I don't know how they froze because", "22:53", "they can just swim to where it's not", "22:54", "frozen so I'd have to I'd have to do", "22:56", "more homework on that one to see what", "22:58", "what caused that Wow so my point is", "23:01", "because of this property of water that", "23:05", "ice floats it insulates the bottom", "23:07", "layers of the lake and fish can survive", "23:09", "over the winter that's work too right", "23:12", "insulate so you can inside you get a", "23:14", "yeah sure yeah yeah I mean if you put a", "23:17", "barrier between you and the changing", "23:19", "elements outside that's basically an", "23:21", "insulating layer ice fishing know I", "23:23", "never know that a university life person", "23:30", "wait do women go ice fishing to get away", "23:32", "from their husbands they do yeah why do", "23:35", "people golf you know the ice fishing is", "23:38", "particularly weird because you have to", "23:41", "continually scoop out the ice and maybe", "23:44", "even drill again right so that works", "23:46", "because frozen water is less dense than", "23:50", "non frozen water and it's one of the", "23:52", "rare ingredients for which that's oh and", "23:53", "it's likely there would be no life on", "23:55", "land or anywhere on earth if that were", "23:58", "the case if the opposite of that were", "23:59", "the case so water is a very special", "24:01", "ingredient to life on earth it's cited", "24:03", "by many religious folks is saying see", "24:05", "earth is sacred for these it's in the", "24:08", "list of special ingredients for what", "24:11", "make earth habitable for life that is a", "24:14", "really strange thing though that if you", "24:16", "can contain it somehow an incredibly", "24:18", "strong pipe yes it won't freeze yes it", "24:20", "won't freeze what is a temper", "24:21", "is there a number well that's why that's", "24:24", "why pipes don't freeze when it just hits", "24:26", "30 degrees outside that's not when you", "24:28", "hear it it freezes when it gets really", "24:30", "low when you crack it yeah and then", "24:32", "it'll break the copper like it's paper", "24:35", "and tear it like it's like it's nothing", "24:37", "now on the flip side of that try this at", "24:42", "home take an ice cube that's like at 30", "24:46", "degrees okay how would you measure that", "24:49", "pull out an ice cube and just because", "24:51", "there'll be at near zero Fahrenheit if", "24:53", "you if you have a good freezer just pull", "24:54", "out and leave it on the counter put put", "24:56", "it on a wooden cutting board okay", "24:58", "and just let it sit there for like 10", "25:01", "minutes and it's temperature will come", "25:03", "up there'll be a point where it hasn't", "25:05", "melted yet but you can take it and", "25:07", "squeeze the ice cube and you can force", "25:11", "it to melt by squeezing it because", "25:13", "you're forcing it into a smaller volume", "25:14", "that it currently contains and the only", "25:17", "way you can accomplish that is if the", "25:19", "ice turns to water then it will occupy a", "25:22", "smaller volume so the act of squeezing", "25:24", "ice can actually melt it so if you had", "25:27", "some sort of a pipe that could", "25:29", "physically constrict like something that", "25:31", "had threads it in there could wind down", "25:33", "to a smaller size you could stick a", "25:34", "cylinder of ice in it and you could", "25:36", "slowly crank it oh yeah yes yes it would", "25:38", "melt yes you can melt if you have some", "25:41", "machine that squeezed ice yeah and the", "25:43", "colder the ice is the hard this the the", "25:45", "more you the the harder it would be for", "25:47", "you to squeeze it to accomplish that so", "25:50", "it's sort of fun with ice in fact you", "25:52", "know what else you can do this is a", "25:53", "harder experiment to do if you take us a", "25:55", "a mesh like a screen mesh that's to be", "25:58", "sort of wider openings then a screen", "26:01", "door would so what would this be like a", "26:03", "fence like a chain-link fence and hold", "26:07", "horizontally and get a big block of ice", "26:08", "and just place it on top a block of ice", "26:11", "is heavy what will happen is the ice the", "26:15", "weight of the ice will melt the ice in", "26:19", "the contact points of the chain itself", "26:22", "because it's feeling that pressure to", "26:25", "squeeze it into a smaller volume but by", "26:27", "the time it melts the ice has now passed", "26:29", "through the grate and it will refreeze", "26:33", "on the other side", "26:35", "so you can actually pass a block of ice", "26:36", "through a chain-link fence vertically", "26:39", "just by pushing it yeah it's pretty it's", "26:42", "pretty cool it's a slow experiment but", "26:44", "it's wrong", "26:45", "I meet depends on the temperature the", "26:47", "ice and how and how and how much it", "26:49", "weighs because the pressure is what this", "26:52", "is why this is why you can ice skate why", "26:54", "can you skate on ice because the edge of", "26:57", "the blade is very high pressure on the", "26:59", "ice and it's melting a bead of order", "27:02", "you're actually gliding on water when", "27:04", "you're skating you're not skating on", "27:06", "slippery ice really yes I thought you", "27:09", "were just cutting the ice with the blade", "27:11", "well so the blade have you ever seen a", "27:13", "sharpened blade it's not just flat", "27:15", "there's actually a concave cross-section", "27:18", "to it so each edge the left edge and the", "27:20", "right edge is is basically at a knife", "27:22", "edge mm-hmm okay not quite as sharp as a", "27:24", "knife but it's you can feel how it's", "27:27", "it's sharp so that when you lean on that", "27:29", "edge either your inner edge or outer", "27:31", "edge your entire bodyweight is being", "27:34", "held up on this on a very narrow surface", "27:39", "area of the blade so the pressure is", "27:42", "extreme it's like you know thousand", "27:44", "pounds per square inch you don't weigh a", "27:46", "thousand pounds but you're not skating", "27:47", "on a square inch right so you you do the", "27:51", "math on that and what you can have is", "27:54", "you will skate and you're actually what", "27:57", "makes it so slippery on ice skates is", "28:00", "because you're moving on a bead of water", "28:02", "that freezes right behind you as you go", "28:04", "past it dude yeah so it's possible for", "28:08", "ice to be so cold you can't really skate", "28:10", "on it because even that pressure is not", "28:12", "enough to melt it how cool would it have", "28:14", "to be that I last I did a calculation", "28:16", "was really cold like tens of degrees", "28:18", "below zero", "28:19", "how does dry ice work oh it's just", "28:21", "frozen carbon dioxide that's all so", "28:24", "here's the difference here's the", "28:25", "difference you have a block of frozen", "28:26", "h2o and a block of frozen co2 so there", "28:31", "they are it turns out the air pressure", "28:34", "on earth is high enough at sea level is", "28:38", "high enough to allow the ice to melt and", "28:43", "sustain a liquid state okay", "28:48", "the co2 under air pressure normal air", "28:52", "pressure it wants to melt but it can't", "28:55", "sustain a liquid and it goes straight to", "28:57", "gas if we had much higher air pressure", "29:02", "you could you could have co2 melt and", "29:06", "have liquid co2 so now watch what happen", "29:09", "so so okay kind of blow your mind again", "29:12", "this is just this is really good stuff", "29:13", "okay it's good like physical chemistry", "29:16", "so here you go so watch it happens so", "29:19", "what happens if I reduce the air", "29:22", "pressure okay well the transition from", "29:25", "ice to water is still the same it's not", "29:27", "affected but the boiling point is", "29:29", "affected as you know cooking times have", "29:32", "to be adjusted on mountaintops because", "29:34", "when you boil water it's not 212 degrees", "29:36", "depending on the height of the mountain", "29:38", "there's less air pressing down that", "29:40", "that's preventing it from boiling okay", "29:43", "the boiling point is not some absolute", "29:45", "facts about the water it has to do with", "29:47", "what the air pressure is sitting above", "29:48", "it if you have extremely high air", "29:50", "pressure water has to go to a much", "29:52", "higher temperature before it boils so", "29:54", "our so the boiling point of water that's", "29:57", "reported in all textbooks is at sea", "29:58", "level at one atmospheric pressure that's", "30:02", "how you get 212 degrees if you start", "30:04", "reducing the atmospheric pressure it's", "30:06", "210 degrees 205 degrees 200 degrees 190", "30:09", "degrees 180 degrees 180", "30:12", "oh yes and so that's not as hot as 212", "30:15", "degrees so you got to cook the food", "30:16", "longer all cooking times are increased", "30:19", "for this reason so now watch I'm not", "30:22", "done with you Oh", "30:23", "let's keep reducing the air pressure", "30:26", "okay theoretical like possible on earth", "30:30", "no no Himalayas yeah but or take it up", "30:34", "you can ascend in some kind of copter or", "30:36", "some kind of device our air balloon or", "30:38", "whatever but I'm saying you can do this", "30:40", "experiment in in a laboratory okay okay", "30:43", "you keep reducing the air pressure", "30:44", "boiling port keeps dropping it's a hard", "30:46", "in 70 degrees 150 hundred twenty a", "30:49", "hundred degrees Fahrenheit", "30:52", "80 degrees Fahrenheit fifty degrees", "30:55", "Fahrenheit forty degrees Fahrenheit", "30:59", "thirty-two degrees Fahrenheit", "31:02", "holy shed what happens the ice melts and", "31:07", "becomes water the water evaporates and", "31:10", "becomes steam and all of that's", "31:12", "happening at 32 degrees there is an", "31:15", "atmospheric pressure for which water ice", "31:18", "and steam coexist and it's called the", "31:22", "triple point of water and all", "31:24", "ingredients have a triple point Wow Mars", "31:29", "Mars is very close to the triple point", "31:32", "of water so you can have you can have a", "31:36", "simultaneous bath in certain regions of", "31:39", "Mars a simultaneous bath because the air", "31:42", "pressure is so low is like one", "31:44", "one-hundredth Earth's air pressure it's", "31:46", "very very low so you know a place where", "31:48", "a pot of water ice cubes and steam are", "31:53", "coming out all at once it's at the", "31:56", "triple point so so so here's the lesson", "31:59", "here is we live life in our world at one", "32:04", "atmospheric pressure at one the room", "32:12", "temperature atmospheric pressure and we", "32:14", "define what is normal", "32:15", "based on that life experience based on", "32:17", "how our senses interact with that", "32:19", "environment but the actual universe is", "32:23", "far freakier than what we that what our", "32:28", "senses are exposed our five senses are", "32:30", "exposed to on earth what did you think", "32:33", "about Elon Musk's idea about nuking the", "32:35", "poles of Mars in order to make it warmer", "32:38", "yes so some of these are kind of pie in", "32:40", "the sky ideas right but let's let's get", "32:43", "to what he's trying to get at what you", "32:45", "want to do is you want to introduce", "32:47", "warmth you want to block the ozone you", "32:50", "want to block the ultraviolet it's so", "32:53", "that you can protect organic life all", "32:55", "right so we have an ozone layer it's", "32:57", "three oxygen atoms oh three and oxytocin", "33:02", "likes ultraviolet light so ultraviolet", "33:05", "light comes from the Sun and gets eaten", "33:07", "by ozone it gets eaten and when you do", "33:10", "that the ultraviolet light doesn't make", "33:13", "it to Earth's surface so", "33:15", "even though they sell where wears", "33:16", "sunscreen and you've sunblock 45 yes", "33:21", "that's for the 1% of the ultraviolet", "33:25", "that gets through the atmosphere if", "33:26", "you're above the atmosphere you are", "33:28", "fried", "33:29", "so the because ultraviolet is highly", "33:32", "hostile to organic molecules and what", "33:36", "we're made of as life", "33:37", "so you want to protect you want to give", "33:40", "life a chance so you want to not only", "33:42", "heat Mars you want to find a way to", "33:44", "block the ultraviolet light coming from", "33:46", "the Sun so you need some mechanism if", "33:48", "not ozone or it just live underground", "33:49", "for example okay", "33:51", "and so so I don't think we should think", "33:56", "of the idea as a literal thing but just", "33:59", "it's a general principle of what you", "34:02", "want to accomplish on Mars in doing so", "34:04", "you want to warm it you want to protect", "34:06", "what could be the future of biochemistry", "34:10", "and then you see it and you and then you", "34:13", "wait you don't know wait too long you", "34:15", "want to sort of speed it up if you could", "34:17", "and then you terraform Mars SpaceX has", "34:20", "I've visited him a couple of times he's", "34:22", "he's got a mug you can buy there then it", "34:24", "has Mars on it okay and then you put put", "34:27", "hot liquid in it and Mars turns to an", "34:30", "arable blue-green marble so yeah it's", "34:35", "very good and it doesn't tell you that", "34:36", "when you so I got a Mars mug you know", "34:38", "and you show it off and oh my gosh what", "34:41", "did that happen it's an earth mug but it", "34:42", "doesn't look like Earth there's a lot of", "34:45", "people that go on also we think there's", "34:49", "a lot of water that was once on Mars", "34:52", "which is a certainty and we think it's", "34:54", "just sitting below in a permafrost so", "34:56", "you wouldn't have to bring water to Mars", "34:59", "by the way in the really distant future", "35:00", "you can just redirect a comet and get", "35:02", "all the water you need but how far", "35:04", "distant is that the Comets everywhere", "35:06", "dude we're in a shooting gallery yeah", "35:08", "that's not what I asked oh do you think", "35:10", "it is before we could read the ref our", "35:12", "weight in time yes okay sorry we know", "35:19", "how to do it but there's no real", "35:21", "incentive so there's no engineering", "35:24", "funded engineering plan to do it but we", "35:26", "know how to do it on paper we know how", "35:28", "to do it", "35:28", "conceivable way oh yeah you so there so", "35:31", "first of all it happens with or without", "35:33", "us because we are in the shooting path", "35:36", "of countless thousands of asteroids and", "35:39", "comets so what you would do is you'd", "35:41", "find one that's headed close to us", "35:43", "anyway", "35:44", "in the seventh orbit down the line or", "35:46", "the hundredth orbit down the line and", "35:48", "then you'd slightly deflect it in such a", "35:51", "way that it would then collide with Mars", "35:54", "or even earth if you wanted the earth", "35:56", "needed some more fresh water yeah I", "35:58", "heard that there's a possible but it", "36:00", "ain't the problem is if something really", "36:02", "big that would fill lakes worth if that", "36:04", "collided with earth that would just be", "36:06", "bad for life on earth because it's a", "36:08", "spontaneous deposit of energy that can", "36:10", "change the climate and do it so you want", "36:12", "to do that on a planet that you're", "36:13", "trying to terraform isn't that the", "36:15", "speculation of how water got here in the", "36:17", "first place", "36:17", "so if the jury's still out on that", "36:19", "there's there tags in the oceans in the", "36:23", "water molecule that tell you that the", "36:27", "water must have come from more than one", "36:28",

"volcanoes emit Lakes and historically", "36:43", "lakes and oceans worth of water just out", "36:45", "of there out of there calderas so so the", "36:49", "problem is what as we say in science", "36:50", "over determined there's plenty of comets", "36:52", "to have delivered all the water there's", "36:54", "plenty of water that could have come out", "36:55", "of out of volcanoes to give us all the", "36:58", "way so but in the oceans it's clearly a", "37:01", "mixture and so the final word is still", "37:04", "out on that what do you think about", "37:06", "what's going on why now with the", "37:07", "protesting of the building of this", "37:09", "largest and latest telescope yes the the", "37:12", "the TMT 30 meter telescope which would", "37:15", "be you know the largest ever by

today are the", "37:30", "same as telescopes when they were", "37:32", "invented they're just bigger", "37:33", "all right the principle behind them is", "37:35", "bigger because what they're doing

from what", "38:27", "I've read view the mountain as a sacred", "38:29", "place and so to put a telescope yet", "38:36", "another telescope there becomes sort of", "38:37", "invasion of sacred land

very", "39:40", "it's very there are a lot of nuanced", "39:42", "issues going on there there's a there's", "39:44", "a branch of thinking that the the United", "39:47", "States government and and

fully", "41:14", "informed and here's a bit of information", "41:16", "I just want to add to the information", "41:18", "okay you know what we do as", "41:23", "astrophysicists we study the universe",

well", "43:42", "I'm not trying to no I know this is", "43:45", "information I'm putting this is", "43:46", "information and I walk out of the room", "43:48", "and then you all vote right I'm not you", "43:51", "know we believe in democracy here and", "43:53", "majority rules that's it that's kind of", "43:54", "a good thing it's kind of worked all", "43:56", "right but if it's not majority rules I", "43:58", "don't know how they're going to make", "43:59", "decision but let's say invent a future", "44:02", "where the natives vote if they vote I", "44:05", "wanted to make sure they heard

don't want", "44:16", "anybody doing anything to it then that's", "44:18", "their decision them you think that's", "44:20", "okay I know I don't", "44:22", "I don't judge Peeples but if you wanted",

come to Hawaii and", "45:18", "find fine legions of scientists they're", "45:20", "conducting experiments okay they found a", "45:23", "t'v peoples governing themselves so so", "45:26", "so that's that the consequence if it", "45:29", "gets voted down and that's permanent and", "45:31", "there's no way around that", "45:32", "that telescope is still gonna be built", "45:34", "it just won't be built in Hawaii well", "45:37", "where will it be built there you have to", "45:38", "be built on mountaintops yeah so there", "45:40", "are the mountaintops an issue right yeah", "45:41", "you want to be above you know somewhat", "45:44", "see clouds and haze and and you want a", "45:48", "dry environment so there's less rain I", "45:50", "went to see what clouds you visited yeah", "45:52", "very good the Keck more than ten years", "45:55", "ago the first time and it was I got very", "46:00", "fortunate it was a night where the moon", "46:01", "was not out yes", "46:03", "moon is not the astronomers favorite", "46:05", "thing yeah you want the darkest sky you", "46:07", "can we were worried as we were driving", "46:09", "up there that was really cloudy but we", "46:11", "drove through the clouds and got to the", "46:13", "top and we got to the observatory and it", "46:16", "was the most amazing without telescopes", "46:18", "just we there was telescopes there but", "46:20", "without telescopes it was the most", "46:22", "amazing view of the sky I'd ever seen in", "46:25", "my life and it changed my perspective of", "46:28", "our place in the universe looked like", "46:30", "you were on a spaceship like we were", "46:33", "flying through the universe because of", "46:35", "the diffuse", "46:35", "lighting in on the big island because", "46:38", "it's all set up so that it doesn't ruin", "46:39", "what they're trying to accomplish at the", "46:41", "CAC reflections in the wrong place not", "46:45", "only that if there was a moon out and", "46:47", "you did ascend up through the clouds the", "46:50", "moonlight illuminates the clouds and you", "46:52", "are an island in the middle of white", "46:56", "cotton yeah and you're not even", "46:59", "connected to the earth it's what you", "47:00", "imagined Mount Olympus would have been", "47:02", "I've been there for them when that", "47:03", "happens with the gods up there and it's", "47:05", "kind of that's their place it's there so", "47:08", "so so yes and so any my my brethren my", "47:14", "fellow astrophysicist who have also", "47:16", "observed from mountaintops by the way", "47:18", "it's becoming a lost art because it's", "47:21", "not lost but it's becoming something we", "47:23", "don't do anymore something called", "47:24", "service observing will you put in your", "47:26", "observing program and it's Hana to a", "47:29", "technician at the telescope who points", "47:31", "the telescope gets the data and sends it", "47:33", "back to you so the next generation", "47:35", "doesn't have the experience that my", "47:37", "generation did because there was a", "47:39", "pilgrimage to the top of the mountain", "47:40", "and you converted your life's path you", "47:43", "we converted your life schedule to", "47:45", "become nocturnal", "47:46", "and in so doing you you know this is the", "47:51", "journey was long enough because you're", "47:53", "in the middle of nowhere now you got to", "47:54", "go nocturnal and by the time you're", "47:56", "ready for this", "47:56", "you are communing with the cosmos it is", "47:59", "you the detector the telescope and the", "48:03", "universe and there's an eerie silence up", "48:08", "there too because you don't hear any the", "48:10", "hum of maybe the the drop of the motor", "48:13", "or of the telescope but that's it and so", "48:15", "so all I'm saying is if they choose to", "48:18", "not have it the tell us we'll go", "48:20", "somewhere else one of them is the Canary", "48:21", "Islands these are also volcanic hilltops", "48:25", "not as high as as Mount aquella that's", "48:29", "at 14,000 feet by the way I should have", "48:31", "checked it what temperature water boils", "48:33", "at the top amount of K we could have", "48:34", "rounded that story out but I think it's", "48:39", "around a hundred eighty degrees actually", "48:40", "I think I did actually calculate it one", "48:42", "time but anyhow so so you'd find a", "48:45", "mountaintop and we'll put it somewhere", "48:47", "else and the data won't be as good", "48:49", "but that'll be a consequence of it and", "48:51", "none of that'll go to Hawaii how do you", "48:53", "think that's gonna get resolved though", "48:54", "if you had to guess I don't know um I uh", "48:59", "I just don't know a lot of people are", "49:02", "against it including Jason Momoa", "49:04", "Aquaman's against it Oh uh-huh", "49:06", "who's out there protesting yeah and so", "49:09", "when you get celebrity types to put the", "49:10", "weight of their name behind it it it", "49:12", "magnifies the cause of others even if", "49:15", "they're in the minority yeah and so I", "49:17", "like I said I think natives should has", "49:22", "everyone know who all the natives are is", "49:24", "it is there some listing so that they", "49:26", "can all vote for this one thing you", "49:27", "wouldn't want people voting who are not", "49:29", "native if you're voting on whether it's", "49:30", "so sacred you don't want to put a", "49:32", "telescope there you'd want people who", "49:33", "have a an indigenous an indigenous", "49:42", "concern for what goes on there and", "49:45", "indigenous in reference to Hawaii's", "49:47", "relative every message of the word", "49:49", "indigenous is relative yeah especially", "49:50", "with Hawaii because the only indigenous", "49:53", "people are black people in Africa", "49:57", "because life human life began in Africa", "50:00", "you everyone else traveled to where they", "50:02", "were so so native its you set a", "50:06", "timeframe to declare what is native and", "50:08", "what's not yeah and a native and it's in", "50:11", "its simplest form is are you born there", "50:13", "so I'm a native New Yorker I'm born", "50:15", "there", "50:15", "but I wasn't the original settler there", "50:18", "I would my species did not form on", "50:21", "Manhattan Island", "50:22", "so everybody traveled to where they are", "50:26", "they just got there before the Europeans", "50:27", "and so that has become the definition of", "50:30", "indigenous all right were you there when", "50:32", "the Europeans landed then you're", "50:34", "indigenous but to other life-forms on", "50:36", "that on that rock on that hawaii's are a", "50:41", "volcanic it's a volcanic archipelago you", "50:47", "know how that happens by the way you", "50:48", "have all these multiple volcanoes in", "50:50", "there sir and a string you ever wonder", "50:52", "why how that happens so you did wonder", "50:56", "what you did you know why oh because", "50:58", "there's a hot spot beneath Earth's crust", "51:00", "it's just sitting there", "51:02", "okay and when you're beneath Earth's", "51:03", "crust stuff doesn't move around the way", "51:05", "it does on Earth's crust Earth's crust", "51:07", "shifts okay so that hot spot gurgles up", "51:10", "makes a volcano then the hot spot goes", "51:12", "dormant but the cot that shelf still", "51:16", "drifts you still have continental drift", "51:18", "so it drifts then the hot spot says time", "51:20", "for me to gurgle again it girls up now", "51:22", "you get another volcano and then it goes", "51:25", "dormant that volcano goes dormant it", "51:26", "shifts you get another one any time you", "51:29", "see an of Islands jet guarantee they're", "51:33", "made by volcanoes over enough time for", "51:36", "continental drift to have shifted the", "51:38", "plates over the hot spot of Earth's", "51:41", "mantle so do you think what they're", "51:43", "concerned with is the eventual spoiling", "51:46", "of this beautiful natural resource that", "51:48", "slowly but surely people are putting up", "51:51", "houses there and developments and all", "51:55", "these different things and then the", "51:56", "scientists are saying we need this", "51:57", "sacred land because we're gonna put a", "51:59", "volcano and they like look this is", "52:01", "already this is already a I mean we're", "52:03", "gonna put a telescope there's already a", "52:04", "telescope up here enough you think", "52:07", "that's what it is they're trying to halt", "52:09", "the progress of civilization or I mean", "52:11", "maybe progress is a bad word the", "52:12", "expansion of civilization yeah I mean", "52:16", "let's go back what did Teddy Roosevelt -", "52:20", "he said we got to preserve these lands", "52:21", "yeah because they're beautiful and by", "52:24", "the way he said that after he shot all", "52:25", "those elephants and tigers lions and", "52:28", "tigers and bears yeah I mean I hail from", "52:31", "a museum the American Museum of Natural", "52:33", "History would where he's the

National", "52:43", "Park System so so that's the secular", "52:47", "version of sacred right we don't say", "52:50", "it's sacred but we've all decided as a", "52:52", "community that we care about these lands", "52:54", "and you don't want to drill on it you", "52:56", "don't want to put housing was it Lyndon", "52:59", "Johnson's wife Lady Bird Johnson who", "53:01", "said our freeways that

"53:26", "stretches of interstate or secularly", "53:30", "sacred if I can say that so I remember", "53:34", "visiting visiting Australia and there's", "53:38", "the the famous rock in the out in the", "53:41", "outback the police help me I get I get", "53:46", "my correct pronunciation of this uluru", "53:49", "and it said it's I'm told it's one", "53:52", "coherent geologic rock it's not just an", "53:56", "assembly of rocks and so I don't know", "53:58", "enough about the geology of it but I do", "54:00", "know that the Australian Aborigines", "54:02", "uluru and ok iconic red rock look at", "54:05", "that cool thing okay so that is one sort", "54:10", "of geologic thing and and climbers want", "54:15", "to climb it but that's heat its miles in", "54:17", "circumference okay so we visited it I", "54:21", "rented a bicycle with my wife and kids", "54:24", "and we rode around it okay so now that", "54:30", "is sacred to the local indigenous", "54:34", "peoples so they don't want you to climb", "54:38", "on it well I'm a rock climber right you", "54:40", "know what do you care I'm not gonna ruin", "54:41", "it I'm not gonna they don't want you to", "54:43", "climb on it and I try to think to myself", "54:45", "is there a counterpart to this that", "54:49", "would sort of wake up a westerner to say", "54:52", "I get it", "54:54", "alright now suppose some people from so", "54:59", "natives from Alaska or from the some", "55:02", "tribes from Africa or some Aborigines", "55:05", "came up from these remote places of the", "55:08", "world walked up to the Vatican and said", "55:11", "we want to climb the walls of this", "55:13", "Vatican just for sport what would we say", "55:16", "we want to climb the walls of st.

"55:33", "say no", "55:33", "get the fucker you would say no these", "55:37", "are important structures to us no are", "55:39", "you gonna say are the equivalent all we", "55:41", "built those you know the natives didn't", "55:43", "build the rock right exactly", "55:45", "okay it depends on how important that", "55:49", "detail is to you all I'm saying is on", "55:52", "the level of weeks say this is sacred", "55:55", "you say that is sacred and now you're", "55:59", "gonna have different rules for who's", "56:00", "climbing what I think it'll for to force", "56:03", "you to take pause so here's an argument", "56:05", "in full in like supporting what you're", "56:08", "saying look at what's going on with the", "56:11", "Himalayas I mean it's the human shit", "56:14", "that they had they leave behind their", "56:16", "welcome I'm so disturbing yeah the", "56:18", "climbers yeah it's horrible it's really", "56:20", "horrible I mean they there's tons of it", "56:23", "tons of human waste okay so what you do", "56:26", "there is if it's still not a problem", "56:28", "that people are climbing it's that", "56:30", "they're leaving waste you don't stop the", "56:32", "climbers you tax them at some level so", "56:34", "then now you have cleanup crews that", "56:35", "come up after them good so they're your", "56:42", "own Taksim you make it worth it all", "56:44", "right understand like they leave the", "56:47", "bodies up there right you know that they", "56:48", "can't that's what I heard that's what I", "56:50", "heard", "56:50", "well why do you think they can bring", "56:52", "tons of shit when they can't even bring", "56:53", "bodies here's what I'm saying when they", "56:55", "invented cars and cars were killing", "56:57", "people in the street because

better off trading in space with", "63:53", "it then bringing it back down to a", "63:55", "planetary surface at the moment the", "63:56", "economics favor that what is the", "63:58", "desalination process so it's it's simply", "64:00", "you just evaporate the water it's", "64:02", "basically a still it's it's it's it's a", "64:05", "it's a distillery right so here's here's", "64:08", "a pocket

the", "65:18", "point now nuclear power plants rely on", "65:22", "steam right isn't that part just just to", "65:25", "finish the point", "65:26", "so you evaporate the water and the salt", "65:29", "left maybe you might want to use that", "65:30", "make some sea salt out of it table salt", "65:33", "and that evaporated water condenses out", "65:35", "over here and that is distilled water",

and then", "65:54", "you pee it out and you'll systematically", "65:56", "drain yourself of important electrolytes", "65:58", "yeah so generally the water that you", "66:01", "would say tastes good and you enjoy has", "66:03", "some mineral bits some some some kind of", "66:08", "mineral minerals in it now nuclear power", "66:11", "plants don't they the process is using", "66:14", "that nuclear

generates the", "66:36", "electricity so so you it's it's a matter", "66:38", "of where do you get the energy to boil", "66:41", "the water that's what it comes down is", "66:42", "it call is it oil is it is it nukes is", "66:45", "it wind is a hydro all of this if you", "66:50", "get a hydro plant oh by the way then a", "66:52", "hydro plant they don't have to make", "66:53", "steam because they have the water the", "66:56", "water pressure at the base of the dam", "66:59", "moves through the turbines that turns", "67:01", "the turbines and they make electricity", "67:02", "so you don't have to heat anything", "67:04", "because they have the water pressure to", "67:06", "do that anyway that is also solar power", "67:08", "by the way because the Sun evaporated", "67:11", "ocean water the water lifts up becomes a", "67:16", "cloud the cloud moves over ground over", "67:18", "the land the cloud rains into the lake", "67:21", "that is above the dam so the energy that", "67:25", "got the water up there in the first", "67:27", "place", "67:27", "is all solar so you should think of", "67:30", "hydroelectric as solar as well as wind", "67:32", "energy because wind is the uneven an", "67:34", "equal heating of air on Earth's surface", "67:37", "and that creates air currents that's", "67:39", "also solar power there's also this also", "67:41", "work isn't it conceivable that you could", "67:43", "come up with a combination of", "67:44", "desalination and power plant where", "67:47", "you're using the heat to combine you", "67:50", "know to make the turbines move and then", "67:52", "you steam it off and that's where you", "67:54", "get the water from that would be a good", "67:56", "that's an interesting idea and I don't", "67:57", "know how much that's been thought about", "67:59", "what you're saying is I'm making steam", "68:01", "anyway yeah so why don't I do it suck", "68:04", "with salt water out yeah yeah and make", "68:07", "that's a nice two for one kind of thing", "68:09", "three for one you get salt and salt out", "68:11", "the other side yes salt gets all you", "68:13", "fresh water get fresh water and you", "68:16", "generate electricity yeah", "68:17", "so do patent it no it's free for anybody", "68:22", "wants it no take that run with it I have", "68:24", "high hopes for tidal energy because", "68:26", "there's certain places on earth where", "68:27", "tides are very powerful and they're very", "68:29", "and you just put some paddles in there", "68:31", "and you sort of and it and it works both", "68:33", "ways when the water comes in and out no", "68:35", "this is battery technology that's the", "68:37", "reason why la isn't completely dependent", "68:39", "upon solar because it seems like this is", "68:40", "the spot to do it like it never rains I", "68:43", "mean if it rains here 50 days yeah it's", "68:45", "crazy or any desert right and we're", "68:47", "you would next door to the Mojave Desert", "68:49", "right so so one of the problems is by", "68:53", "the way the deserts are generally", "68:54", "localized to certain latitudes on earth", "68:57", "it's because of general circulation on", "68:59", "earth so the air pockets on earth", "69:04", "there's a lot going on earth air moves", "69:06", "in a lot of ways but there's a there's", "69:08", "an overriding circulation of air that", "69:11", "has air sort of rising up at the equator", "69:16", "imagine a cylindrical movement of air", "69:19", "that that that Gerdes the earth okay", "69:22", "so just above the equator you have a", "69:25", "cylinder rotating where you have air", "69:27", "rising and just below the equator you", "69:30", "have a cylinder rotating the opposite", "69:33", "wave so that air is still rising at the", "69:36", "equator okay", "69:37", "so it rises at the equator its unstable", "69:38", "it makes clouds the equators one is the", "69:40", "cloudiest place on earth practically one", "69:42", "of the cloudiest places well how about", "69:44", "the other side of those cylinders where", "69:46", "the air descends okay okay when you have", "69:52", "descending air you don't make clouds", "69:55", "well how big is the cylinder it's about", "69:57", "thirty degrees of latitude wide so your", "70:03", "rainiest places on earth are at the", "70:05", "equator that's where you get the Amazon", "70:07", "rainforest in the lake and your driest", "70:10", "places on earth or at 30 degrees north", "70:12", "and 30 degrees south because these", "70:16", "cylindrical movements of air have", "70:19", "descending air there so the Mojave", "70:21", "Desert the Sahara Desert the Gobi Desert", "70:26", "they're all around 30 degrees north", "70:29", "latitude so this so we live on the", "70:35", "surface of the earth where there are", "70:36", "forces operating that are so much bigger", "70:39", "than us that we would not even think", "70:42", "about it why is an India would be a", "70:45", "desert because it's right in that zone", "70:47", "we're it not for the seasonal monsoons", "70:53", "it doesn't rain much in India except", "70:56", "when it's monsoon season so the monsoon", "70:59", "is sort of the exception", "71:01", "what would otherwise happen there and", "71:03", "that's why everyone loves the monsoon", "71:04", "and they hate it but they love it it", "71:07", "cools the whether they get sources water", "71:09", "there it is", "71:11", "so they ask you the question again okay", "71:13", "not answered sorry oh so so so battery", "71:17", "technology like what why isn't LA", "71:19", "completely solar it should be it's not", "71:21", "that some of it is cost", "71:23", "la is so car heavy all right and plus", "71:28", "you know there's a Lamborghini passing", "71:30", "me at 20 miles an hour on the 405 that", "71:34", "this is the the land of wasted", "71:36", "horsepower right so any place that has a", "71:40", "lot of sunlight should be thriving on", "71:42", "solar panels and you guys aren't I", "71:43", "looked around very few how very few", "71:45", "homes have solar panels and I don't", "71:46", "fully understand that you could if you", "71:50", "did that then you'd run your own run off", "71:51", "your own power you can do this yeah you", "71:53", "can do the equation difficult by the way", "71:55", "and so so yeah I mean the price might", "72:00", "have to come down a little further you", "72:01", "don't really see the full price of oil", "72:04", "it's it's subsidized in ways that are", "72:07", "not obvious to us you know we built the", "72:10", "roads with our taxes so that car", "72:12", "companies could sell you a car that you", "72:14", "drove on the road that they that was", "72:17", "built for them if they have to build all", "72:19", "their own roads the price of gas to go", "72:20", "in the car would have been much higher", "72:21", "the price of your car would have been", "72:23", "that all that would have been much", "72:24", "higher if the car companies do it what", "72:26", "I'm saying is I make a product and I", "72:28", "want you to use it but there's no roads", "72:30", "oh I convinced you to build the road so", "72:33", "you can buy my car and drive on that", "72:34", "road that's a weird way of looking at it", "72:37", "but in some ways it's it's full cost", "72:39", "accounting it's full cost accounting", "72:41", "what is the cost of coal it's how many", "72:43", "people died of lung disease of new mono", "72:46", "ultra-microscopic silica volcano County", "72:48", "OSIS okay that's the longest word in the",

cost of", "73:28", "that source of energy", "73:29", "if you full cost accounted what all this", "73:32", "really costs then the solar option would", "73:35", "look way better than it does relative to", "73:38", "it that's all I'm telling but when", "73:40", "you're talking about cars and car", "73:42", "manufacturers having to pay for roads", "73:43", "isn't that they didn't say once isn't", "73:46", "that like restaurants having to pay for", "73:47", "toilet paper no restaurants going", "73:49", "restaurants have to pay for land", "73:52", "that you would park your car on to go", "73:56", "into the restaurant not in New York City", "73:58", "but in places where everybody has cars", "74:00", "you don't have valet parking I my", "74:02", "restaurant will not occupy the entire", "74:04", "plot of land I just bought it's gonna be", "74:07", "something's gonna be 1/4 of that land", "74:09", "and all the rests are gonna be parking", "74:11", "spots", "74:11", "I have absorbed the cost of your parking", "74:14", "your car in me in my acquisition of that", "74:18", "of that real estate for example to make", "74:20", "it convenient so people could use your", "74:22", "facility correct so right but I bore", "74:24", "that cost as as restaurateur right or", "74:28", "maybe I'm renting of course but that's", "74:30", "that's it does not relate to someone the", "74:33", "car manufacturer is being forced to pay", "74:36", "for the roads or that they should be", "74:38", "that would have been interesting had", "74:39", "they because then it would have changed", "74:41", "the pricing of everything but why would", "74:43", "they be are you gonna make a car no one", "74:45", "has a road to drive it on it's what it's", "74:49", "your responsibility then you don't have", "74:51", "a business but don't you want a car yes", "74:54", "so we all agree cars are good they move", "74:56", "fast they get you where you want to go", "74:58", "right so how do we as society make it", "75:01", "easier for people to get where they want", "75:02", "to go well we all chip in and we make", "75:04", "roads it's not entirely - before there", "75:07", "were cars a car nobody is sneaking you", "75:08", "know I want to go to Chicago tomorrow", "75:09", "and I'll be back on Thursday no one is", "75:11", "even having that thought before they", "75:13", "were

you can ask how much energy is in", "85:07", "that well not much it's not much energy", "85:10", "in a visible light photons if you stayed", "85:13", "there long enough you might feel a", "85:14",

energy because", "85:53", "they're thinking energy is going to be", "85:54", "free in the future but what they didn't", "85:57", "figure was that information would be", "86:01", "free or easy to

problem no one saw that", "86:15", "coming nobody saw that coming so as your", "86:20", "photons get higher and higher energy", "86:22", "yes you can start doing things with them", "86:24", "you get x-rays and gamma-rays", "86:25", "but that's not what Tesla was referring", "86:27", "to he was talk about moving radio waves", "86:29", "through the space that would charge", "86:31", "things up you can't pack sufficient", "86:35", "energy in your radio wave to do anything", "86:38", "we need to do", "86:39", "mechanically currently current well back", "86:44", "then would it be sufficient it might", "86:46", "have been something you could have done", "86:47", "with your radio waves cuz the needs were", "86:49", "no but no snow I take that back that was", "86:52", "the height of the

he was considering it for", "87:04", "things like radios or light bulbs or", "87:07", "household items would it be possible to", "87:10", "use that power for that so now what so", "87:13", "what happens so the radio waves if you", "87:14", "had enough power in radio waves to", "87:16", "generate a light bulb to power a light", "87:18", "bulb well through the air are you", "87:23", "standing

a", "88:02", "storage system but you would still", "88:04", "probably have some sort of residual", "88:06", "effect of having this stuff broadcast", "88:07", "through the air and who knows what I",

it's not", "88:46", "structural bread slice the end of bricks", "88:48", "and then they mortar and everything okay", "88:51", "so so we're both right we'll bring it", "88:55", "but it's not structural

energy no he doesn't well I don't", "89:27", "think anyone saying that but what he did", "89:28", "and his fans do but back then there were", "89:31", "no computers back there were no", "89:33",

"is the jet black yeah yes I saw my soul", "89:57", "and recently black yes so light can", "90:00", "bounce off of it so not only can't drive", "90:02", "it because people won't be able to see", "90:05", "it at night Oh", "90:05", "literally saying like this is just the", "90:08", "theoretical you want to you can line it", "90:10", "with with the triage of it cuz I'm sure", "90:13", "I saw one in a parking lot it's fuck", "90:14", "it's very bad I saw one in real life", "90:16", "it's that's not what I saw I saw a", "90:18", "sports car purchase vantablack car they", "90:21", "have I saw a sports car that was it was", "90:23", "not this the car you have up there I", "90:25", "don't know what that is what I saw a BMW", "90:26", "that they painted vantablack okay well", "90:28", "then that mess is black is available I'm", "90:30", "on their badass low to the ground sports", "90:33", "car and so what no it's not available", "90:36", "commercially what do you want me saying", "90:38", "so I'm saying that for BMW it's not it's", "90:40", "not something they're off I'm in LA you", "90:42", "have all your cars here anything that is", "90:44", "everything showcased here what I didn't", "90:45", "see it in New York I saw it here in LA", "90:47", "well I'm sure", "90:48", "or so maybe wasn't BMW maybe somebody", "90:50", "else did and I'm just saying BMW if", "90:52", "someone did it BMW didn't make it", "90:55", "themselves okay someone must have done I", "90:57", "mean you can do it it's a real thing", "90:58", "vantablack okay so one of the principles", "91:01", "of stealth is that if you send a signal", "91:04", "to it it never comes back to you so you", "91:08", "have no sort of radar measures its", "91:10", "existence correct but there are two ways", "91:14", "you can do that one of them is you", "91:16", "cannot reflect back okay but so by", "91:20", "absorbing it right okay so jet matte", "91:23", "black will absorb it and not reflect it", "91:26", "back but if there's enough energy coming", "91:29", "at it it will heat up because you can't", "91:31", "get something for nothing here it'll", "91:33", "heat up the skin of that and it could be", "91:35", "bad for the occupants that's what they", "91:37", "said about the art the art will no Manta", "91:39", "but if you put that in the desert forget", "91:41", "it well they were saying even in Los", "91:42", "Angeles where are so hot exactly so", "91:44", "another way to do it is this signal", "91:46", "comes to me and I reflect it in a", "91:49", "direction that is not back to you so the", "91:53", "b-2 bomber is not only non reflective", "91:56", "back to you it takes the signal and", "92:00", "reflects it and double bounces it so", "92:03", "that all of your energy gets sent in", "92:05", "other directions and not back to you so", "92:07", "it doesn't then keep the energy that was", "92:10", "sent to it", "92:10", "so that's another way to do it another", "92:13", "there's another stealth which was", "92:15", "featured in one of the recent not recent", "92:17", "four years ago James Bond movies where", "92:20", "light that comes at it the light that's", "92:22", "behind it goes around it coherently and", "92:27", "continues to come towards you so that", "92:30", "you think you're seeing what's behind it", "92:33", "and it's not there you are seeing what's", "92:37", "behind it but the path of that light", "92:38", "went around the vessel and continue it", "92:41", "on its way to you so you think you're", "92:43", "just seeing the grass in

me", "132:55", "let me just give that I'll give the the", "132:57", "the sort of Reader's Digest version of", "133:00", "this okay okay", "133:02", "there are black holes that are there", "133:07",

hole", "135:09", "that eats its way there fine but we", "135:13", "don't know how to make one and we think", "135:16", "we colleagues who have done this think", "135:19", "they've discovered a black

for science so black hole shock", "136:04", "theories swirl around the discovery of a", "136:06", "physically impossible black hole so", "136:09", "scientists don't use the word impossible", "136:11",

"136:23", "can say it is a black hole that comes", "136:25", "from and if it comes from an object it", "136:28", "is an object we know nothing about and", "136:30", "have yet to discover well we're not", "136:32", "going to say it's an impossible on Jeff", "136:33", "mm-hmm every time we point a telescope", "136:35", "to the universe we find something that", "136:36", "we never predicted or

"136:47", "like the supermassive black holes at the", "136:49", "center of every galaxy that was a fairly", "136:51", "recent discovery in terms it was a sized", "136:54", "because we saw the Centers of galaxies", "136:56", "behaving really weirdly things stars", "136:58", "were moving faster than they should have", "137:00", "given how much gravity was tugging on", "137:02", "them and we said dude something's got to", "137:05", "be there and it's got to be really small", "137:07", "because we're tracking star is really", "137:10", "close to the middle well if it was made", "137:13", "of

"137:19", "that could fill that small volume and", "137:21", "have that much gravity is a black hole", "137:22", "so it's suspected for a long time it was", "137:25", "confirmed that as a common thing by the", "137:28", "Hubble telescope and first photographed", "137:30", "by this recent result in the galaxy m87", "137:34", "Messier 87 is what it's that's the name", "137:36", "of the galaxy and you can determine how", "137:39", "big the black hole is based on the size", "137:41", "of the galaxy we can determine the mass", "137:43", "of the black hole by how fast stars are", "137:44", "moving at the distance they are from it", "137:46", "so in other words so so where Earth", "137:50", "orbiting the Sun and we have a certain", "137:51", "speed we're going about forgot how does", "137:54", "it but 18 miles per second I think", "137:58", "that's the number 30 kilometers a second", "138:00", "that's our speed around that's a speed", "138:02", "around the Sun that's pretty fast okay", "138:05", "if the Sun had more mass instantly that", "138:12", "speed is not enough to maintain our", "138:14", "orbit and we'll start spiraling in", "138:16", "towards it if the Sun had less mass that", "138:20", "speed is too high to be in this orbit", "138:25", "it'll take it to up sorry it's too fast", "138:28", "to maintain this horbet it'll climb us", "138:30", "out to a higher orbit slow us down and", "138:33", "we'll be in a higher orbit with a slower", "138:35", "speed so in other words for any object", "138:38", "at any distance there's only one speed", "138:41", "you can maintain

to calculate how much mass the", "138:54", "thing is orbiting and you get the mass", "138:56", "and you can't see it it's", "138:58", "it's a black hole and that ladies and", "139:01", "gentlemen is
