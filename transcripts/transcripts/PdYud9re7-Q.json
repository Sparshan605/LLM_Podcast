way we thought it", "56:51", "was gonna go how we going to adjust", "56:53", "right now to prevent this from getting", "56:54", "worse which means what you really have", "56:57", "to do is prior to

gonna happen it's", "57:34", "war so you have to be willing to kill", "57:37", "you have to be willing to have that", "57:38", "happen and you have to be willing to die", "57:41", "because when you go to war there's gonna", "57:43", "be American kids that are not gonna come", "57:46", "home and so you have to have those two", "57:49", "wills that's before you go in so you", "57:52", "can't look at it and say well you know", "57:53", "we can go in a little you can move this", "57:55", "guy and probably it'll turn out okay so", "57:56", "we don't have to worry about what the", "57:57", "sacrifices are gonna be another thing to", "57:59", "think about when we went to war when you", "58:02", "went to world war two World War one", "58:04", "those kids 18 years old 17 years old", "58:08", "those kids went to war until the war was", "58:12", "over they were they went on deployment", "58:14", "like now you know the in the in the Navy", "58:16", "in the Marine Corps to six seven-month", "58:18", "deployment and the army sometimes it's a", "58:20", "14 month deployment and then they're", "58:21", "gonna rotate back to the States in World", "58:23", "War two is like oh cool yeah we're at", "58:25", "war you'll be home when it's over so", "58:28", "five years four years if that was our", "58:31", "attitude going into the war this is so", "58:33", "important to us that johnny is gonna get", "58:36", "on a ship and he's gonna sail to the", "58:38", "Pacific and if he comes home it's gonna", "58:40", "be in three years four years five years", "58:42", "that's what we're talking about that's", "58:43", "the level of commitment we have so when", "58:46", "we start looking at going into other", "58:48", "countries we need to start thinking okay", "58:49", "what level of commitment do we really", "58:51", "have to make this successful and and", "58:54", "like even when I look at Iraq you know I", "58:56", "was in Iraq and fought in Iraq from a", "58:59", "granular perspective being on the ground", "59:02", "Battle of Ramadi 2006 the citizens of", "59:06", "Ramadi the normal citizens of Ramadi", "59:08", "were overjoyed that we were there and it", "59:11", "was like we were we were angels to go", "59:14", "there and help them get rid of these", "59:16", "heinous al Qaeda insurgents which", "59:20", "eventually came became Isis", "59:23", "unfortunately you know we kind of we we", "59:25", "did a great job Ramadi was the model of", "59:30", "counterinsurgency for about seven years", "59:32", "and it was less violent than many cities", "59:36", "in America and I had great pride and at", "59:39", "least", "59:40", "understood the sacrifices my friends", "59:43", "that were killed my friends that never", "59:44", "came home my friends that won't get to", "59:46", "have kids right they did all that they", "59:49", "gave all that and I was able to look", "59:50", "around and say you know what these folks", "59:52", "in this foreign country they're gonna", "59:55", "have an opportunity for freedom and", "59:58", "unfortunately because of politics and", "60:01", "whatever we said okay you know what", "60:03", "we're we're not staying there we're", "60:04", "gonna leave as soon as we left everybody", "60:06", "that been on the ground in Iraq was like", "60:08", "mmm this is probably not a good idea", "60:10", "this is probably not a good idea to bail", "60:12", "out right now we don't need to leave a", "60:13", "massive force there but you know if we", "60:14", "leave a few you know we leave a couple", "60:17", "brigades worth of men then Oh we'll", "60:21", "probably be able to handle any problems", "60:22", "that that happened", "60:23", "well we didn't we left completely and", "60:25", "and those those insurgents that were", "60:27", "there they were like little embers and", "60:29", "they started to they started to get", "60:30", "fired up again and then the next thing", "60:31", "you know you had Isis and by the way", "60:33", "Isis marched back into Ramadi and they", "60:37", "the reports we got from people on the", "60:39", "ground that we knew was that Isis came", "60:41", "in and anyone that had worked with", "60:43", "coalition forces in any level they would", "60:45", "murder the whole family was about 500", "60:47", "families that were completely murdered", "60:48", "so when we talk about these things we", "60:53", "have to be very sure about what we're", "60:56", "gonna do we have to recognize that we", "60:58", "can't predict everything because we", "61:00", "can't I don't care how good you are and", "61:01", "care how many analysis you put on", "61:03", "something when you start throwing human", "61:04", "nature into a leadership vacuum all", "61:06", "these things are gonna break out and", "61:07", "it's gonna it can go very very bad it", "61:10", "can go well too but it can go very very", "61:12", "bad and so what are we willing to", "61:14", "sacrifice what are we willing to spend", "61:16", "how many of our brothers and sisters in", "61:18", "uniform are we willing to sacrifice to", "61:21", "make this happen and how does it help", "61:22", "our national security I believe right", "61:24", "now had we stayed there Iraq would be a", "61:27", "pretty strong positive place right now", "61:30", "if we had kind of completed the mission", "61:33", "the way that we should have again when", "61:37", "we go back and we say okay well what", "61:39", "what what countries is it worth going", "61:41", "into you know where are we gonna go what", "61:43", "how do we draw that line or how do we", "61:45", "make that decision for me this is this", "61:47", "is what we do as leaders what we do as", "61:49", "leaders we look at a situation and and", "61:51", "sometimes you know you can ask yourself", "61:52", "do we have a moral", "61:53", "obligation to go somewhere if there's a", "61:55", "genocide happening if there's another", "61:58", "Rwanda happening where 800,000 Tutsis", "62:02", "are killed in hundred days with machetes", "62:06", "if that's going on do we have a moral", "62:07", "obligation to try and do something to", "62:10", "help that hey that's a decision you have", "62:12", "to meet that's a hard decision to make", "62:13", "as leader because guess what you're", "62:15", "gonna lose 30 40 100 Americans that are", "62:18", "going in there and trying to shut this", "62:19", "thing down but that's the that's the", "62:21", "type of thing we need to think about and", "62:22", "that's why as a leader you want to have", "62:25", "an open mind you want to have your ego", "62:27", "completely out of it because it's real", "62:30", "easy to say oh this is where America", "62:31", "this is what we do this is we're gonna", "62:33", "win it's like no actually we made a bad", "62:34", "decision and we're actually leaving", "62:36", "right now because we think the", "62:38", "expenditure from here on out is going to", "62:40", "be too hot unfortunate I think in Iraq", "62:41", "we paid the upfront expenditure we had", "62:44", "invested lives and treasure to try and", "62:47", "get that play stabilized we had done a", "62:49", "decent job we were almost there and we", "62:51", "left early and all of a sudden we look", "62:53", "around to go but that's why these things", "62:56", "are important to to think about", "62:58", "thoroughly as Tulsi said before you go", "63:01", "we don't know what's going to happen and", "63:04", "you know if you're gonna get in a street", "63:06", "fight Joe like you look as capable as", "63:09", "you are as capable as I am at street", "63:11", "fighting that's great there is that 10", "63:13", "percent chance that that guy pulls out a", "63:15", "knife and sticks it in your neck and are", "63:17", "you willing to sacrifice that now if the", "63:20", "guys doing something to an innocent", "63:22", "person and you go you know what I got to", "63:24", "take that risk right now I'm gonna go in", "63:26", "and I'm gonna get this thing handled", "63:27", "those are hard decisions to make and we", "63:29", "have to think through them if there was", "63:32", "very well said if there was one thing", "63:34", "when I brought you two together that I", "63:36", "thought that you might disagree on it", "63:38", "would be this stance on non", "63:40", "interventionist foreign policy I don't", "63:43", "know if that's even the right word", "63:44", "disagree but I think there's nuances to", "63:47", "these decisions and these things you", "63:49", "taught I think you would agree with that", "63:50", "and then Rwanda what you talked about is", "63:52", "a great example do you have a moral", "63:54", "responsibility to go in when you see", "63:56", "some atrocities being committed I mean", "63:58", "that's one thing that people either pro", "64:01", "or con honors is the United States are", "64:04", "we the police force of the world are we", "64:06", "the moral high ground", "64:07", "yeah III don't just just listening to", "64:10", "jock I think that I don't think that", "64:12", "that we actually disagree very much do", "64:15", "you tell me if I'm wrong but I think", "64:18", "there there are important distinctions", "64:19", "to be made you know my opposition to", "64:22", "regime change wars should not be", "64:26",

there", "92:04", "was nothing like hey you guys screwed up", "92:05", "fixed this that is so sketchy it's so", "92:13", "scary and it and so you know our tech", "92:15", "guys are freaking out they're like man", "92:17", "this is what we were waiting for and now", "92:19", "you guys took our countdown tell us what", "92:20", "we gotta do to get it back up and a we", "92:23", "didn't hear back for a

put your account", "92:32", "back nothing and then all of a sudden", "92:33", "you know hours and hours had gone by and", "92:36", "then our account was reinstated without", "92:38", "any explanation about what happened and", "92:40", "you know this is this is bigger than", "92:44", "just the the loss and opportunity that", "92:47", "that my campaign had because this", "92:50", "happened on that night during that peak", "92:52", "period it's a bigger issue about the", "92:54", "power that this corporation has", "92:57", "in Google in interfering essentially in", "93:00", "fair elections and in what kind of", "93:02", "information they are willing to put in", "93:04", "front of people don't they own Boston", "93:06", "Dynamics - does Google on Boston", "93:08", "Dynamics they didn't I sold it you get", "93:20", "extra a double bonus credit for me right", "93:22", "now Tulsi cuz that right there is so", "93:26", "crazy and for you to be like yeah it's", "93:27", "bad for me but it's also bad for the", "93:28", "American people I would have been stuck", "93:30", "it bad for me if they did that and it's", "93:35", "so transparent yeah", "93:36", "very few people talked about it and very", "93:38", "few people know about it exactly that's", "93:40", "what it was so stunning about it it's", "93:41", "like there's people pulling strings who", "93:44", "why not undefined and no investigation", "93:48", "into it until you put out this lawsuit", "93:50", "there's really no way to find out yeah", "93:52", "yeah it started to force that", "93:54", "conversation that was continuing to push", "93:56", "to the forefront", "93:57", "about how particularly with Google and", "93:59", "Facebook the inordinate amount of power", "94:02", "that they have to as we sit and type in", "94:05", "a Google search for whatever or we know", "94:08", "what's popping up on our Facebook feed", "94:10", "they control that I think that we have a", "94:13", "real issue in this country with", "94:15", "advertising in those things in Google", "94:17", "and Facebook a real issue that it's", "94:19", "never really been fully discussed", "94:20", "because those things just sort of came", "94:22", "up out of nowhere", "94:22", "you know we had social networks we had", "94:25", "MySpace and we had you know we didn't", "94:27", "think anything of it and then all of a", "94:28",

people put out", "94:36", "they have algorithms that figure out", "94:38", "what you're into and then show you that", "94:41", "so if you're just really in a conflict", "94:42", "which most people are they just showing", "94:44", "you conflict all day long and it's", "94:46", "getting everybody riled up so it's", "94:47", "having a direct effect whether it's", "94:50", "planned and coordinated or not it's", "94:52", "having a direct effect on discourse in", "94:54", "this country and I think it's one of the", "94:56", "reasons why what you were talking about", "94:57", "before were you're either with us or", "94:59", "you're against us and it's never been", "95:01", "more hardline than it has been right now", "95:04", "and all of this is because of", "95:05", "advertising money and advertising what", "95:08", "like what are you even selling", "95:10", "all you do you're just a portal to", "95:11", "connect people with each other and", "95:13", "through that you're gaining an insane", "95:15", "amount of influence and an extraordinary", "95:18", "amount of money's being generated and we", "95:19", "never agreed to it right it's just sort", "95:21", "of we just look down we saw the ad what", "95:23", "are they selling oh yeah okay looks like", "95:25", "a nice watch and they were just all of", "95:27", "it and then everybody's just getting", "95:29", "bought and sold and it's happening to a", "95:32", "point now where that is one of the main", "95:36", "town halls one of the main places where", "95:39", "people discuss ideas in the world right", "95:42", "as these social media networks and", "95:44", "they're not getting smaller they're only", "95:45", "getting bigger so they keep growing and", "95:47", "they keep stacking up and whether it's", "95:48", "Google or Facebook or any of the Twitter", "95:51", "and v's the amount of influence they", "95:53", "have is insane and they're just people", "95:54", "right they're just people these are just", "95:56", "regular folks like I know Jack Dorsey", "95:58", "he's a nice guys it's a regular fucking", "96:00", "person the fact that this guy has so", "96:02", "much power this company has so much", "96:04", "power that any of these companies have", "96:06", "so much power we are not ready for this", "96:08", "and this is happening right under our", "96:10", "noses now and it's happening so quickly", "96:12", "and then when something like your Google", "96:14", "situation happens where it's like well", "96:17", "not only you profiting but now you're", "96:19", "fucking pulling strings you're showing", "96:21", "us you're pulling strings yeah and", "96:23", "everybody's like bended whatever they're", "96:29", "interfering with democracy in this weird", "96:32", "sort of semi legal way you know like", "96:35", "that you could just say they violated", "96:37", "policy like what policy what policy did", "96:39", "you violate that they just canceled your", "96:41", "ass if they still have not told us that", "96:43", "doesn't say you violated was being a", "96:45", "viable candidate but one that's saying", "96:52", "hey you guys are too fucking big yeah", "96:54", "I'm gonna break up these monopolies and", "96:57", "provide the kinds of oversight and", "96:58", "accountability that will protect the", "97:01", "consumer that will protect the American", "97:03", "people protect fair and honest discourse", "97:06", "protect freedom of speech that's the", "97:09", "issue and that's and that's the", "97:10", "difference between me and and somebody", "97:14", "like mayor Pete for example other", "97:17", "candidates and he's not the only one but", "97:19", "other candidates who refuse to take a", "97:22", "strong", "97:23", "position in recognizing the threat to", "97:26", "our public discourse and our democracy", "97:29", "that these tech giants have really", "97:32", "within the hands of just a few people", "97:34", "you have I think this is just broke in", "97:38", "the news recently", "97:39", "Mark Zuckerberg who you know people were", "97:42", "taught he's like wanted to run for", "97:43", "president not that long ago and was", "97:45", "seriously considering it and you know", "97:47", "he's trying to start his own", "97:50", "cryptocurrency wants to have his own", "97:52", "currency that he controls like the", "97:53", "amount of power this guy has and that he", "97:55", "wants to continue to grow is is so", "97:58", "dangerous he decided not to run for", "98:00", "president but he and his wife started", "98:02", "emailing a mayor Pete's campaign manager", "98:05", "saying hey here's some guys we think you", "98:06", "should hire for your campaign and so", "98:09", "they hired two of Zuckerberg Facebook", "98:10", "guys who are now working for mayor", "98:12", "Pete's campaign and so they're gonna", "98:15", "have a seat at the table should this guy", "98:16", "get elected", "98:17", "which means Facebook's gonna have a seat", "98:19", "at the table never mind what if he gets", "98:21", "elected when he's got two people at our", "98:23", "inside track at Facebook yeah that show", "98:25", "up there", "98:26", "I don't know if you've ever done", "98:27", "anything with Facebook as far as", "98:28", "advertising but like people that", "98:30", "understand how all that stuff works I'll", "98:31", "talk to him before it's a whole science", "98:34", "behind it so now that they're in there", "98:35", "he should get a big bump across the", "98:38", "board yeah I don't know Mark Zuckerberg", "98:40", "but I don't like the way he drinks water", "98:44", "have you seen that the weirdest little", "98:47", "sips of water I don't I don't trust a", "98:49", "person man woman or non-binary creature", "98:52", "it takes sips of water like that that is", "98:54", "just not the way you drink water we", "98:56", "drink waters like I'm thirsty I'm gonna", "98:58", "have some more that's how you show me", "99:01", "how he did it", "99:03", "well show you will play the video it's", "99:06", "like this he's like he puts this glass", "99:07", "up to his mouth and touches his lips at", "99:10", "the voice like a robot why here we go", "99:12", "watch this look at this he's a robot", "99:14", "pretending to drink watch this what the", "99:17", "fuck is happening here what is happening", "99:19", "here the water didn't boo barely moved", "99:24", "it barely likes slide that Jamie was", "99:27", "able to find that same it has a master", "99:29", "so so to see this from a strategic", "99:33", "perspective", "99:34", "all right do you feel like these moves", "99:38", "like you coming out strong against", "99:39", "Google Facebook saying that you could", "99:41", "break up those types of monopolies", "99:42", "strategically are you thinking right now", "99:45", "well maybe that wasn't the best call", "99:46", "because you know you could have not been", "99:50", "so strong against them and and played", "99:52", "along with them a little bit maybe they", "99:53", "look at you and go through the list that", "99:55", "that Jill went through earlier which is", "99:56", "you're a veteran you're a woman you're a", "99:59", "woman of color you're from Hawaii you've", "100:01", "got this experience congresswoman yeah", "100:02", "congresswoman you got all this stuff", "100:04", "they could look at you go out yeah she's", "100:06", "good we can get her on our side and then", "100:08", "maybe you know increase your chances of", "100:11", "getting elected then you get elected", "100:12", "then you go okay you know what I've", "100:13", "thought about this and guess what we're", "100:15", "not doing it that way and I'm gonna", "100:16", "break you guys up do you think", "100:17", "strategically or is that just your the", "100:20", "type of person you are is like you know", "100:21", "what I'm just gonna I'm just going to", "100:23", "tell the truth from the get-go is that", "100:24", "basically what I tell the truth and call", "100:26", "it straight no matter what and and you", "100:30", "know no matter who who I'm dealing with", "100:32", "because eight that's who I am and the", "100:36", "people are sick and tired of politicians", "100:38", "who play this game and do this political", "100:41", "dance as they're trying to get people", "100:43", "elected and they're like okay well if I", "100:45", "just if I just say this or if I just", "100:47", "kind of cozy up to these people or these", "100:49", "interests they can help me get elected", "100:51", "and then when I win then I'm gonna do", "100:54", "the right thing well guess what as when", "100:56", "you win all of you okay I've got to win", "100:58", "the next reelection that means I need", "100:59", "more money from Wall

reelected then that's when", "101:08", "I'm really gonna start to do the right", "101:10", "thing and and I think people across", "101:13", "party lines are sick and tired of the", "101:15", "same old politicians who say one thing", "101:18", "and do another and instead are looking", "101:21", "for real leadership it just seems like", "101:23", "there's a tipping point that we all have", "101:25", "to reach before that actually happens I", "101:27", "don't know if we're there yet it's kind", "101:29", "of like you know when I was on your", "101:31", "podcast for the first time Joe and you",

"144:41", "have a long-term idea like if if you", "144:45", "don't win in 2020 are you gonna stick", "144:48", "around for 2024 like how what is what", "144:50", "are your thoughts on that I'm focused on", "144:53", "2020 and then once that passes whether", "144:57", "you win or not then you think about the", "144:59", "few access so you're only 38 right yeah", "145:02", "I don't buy that gray hair either I", "145:03", "think it's fake I think you said like a", "145:13", "streak just a cool-looking streak no", "145:16", "it's right no yeah you're gonna keep it", "145:18", "if the whole thing

"146:05", "so committed to the machine and you're", "146:08", "one of the best examples of that I think", "146:10", "because there's so much exciting about", "146:12", "what you're saying there's so

"yeah yeah yeah people what people are", "148:37", "are seeing through the you know the the", "148:40", "facade that is presented by the", "148:43", "corporate media and I think finding the",

if they're", "148:56", "given my campaign $5 or you know $10 a", "148:59", "month like there's so much power that is", "149:01", "that is uh I think people are", "149:04", "discovering within their

us and before the people", "149:17", "in having their voices heard who is an", "149:20", "elite now it's still Biden right and", "149:21", "behind Biden is Elizabeth Warren is that", "149:23", "what the ideas it seems like it it seems", "149:26", "like I think when you look at some of", "149:27", "these polls I think that's the other", "149:28", "thing is is they most often represent", "149:30",

think I need one", "151:16", "more poll to meet that requirement which", "151:19", "is again is directly like you look at", "151:21", "look at a guy like I think Pete Buddha", "151:22", "judge he
