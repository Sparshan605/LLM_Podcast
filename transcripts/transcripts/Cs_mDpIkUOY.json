one of", "06:45", "the biggest problems I'm looking at is", "06:46", "who determines what's essential and", "06:48", "what's not essential", "06:49", "yeah weed stores are essential so we", "06:51", "heard it like in Michigan for instance", "06:53", "they were closing off certain parts of", "06:55", "certain stores did you hear about this", "06:57", "No", "06:58", "so a lot of people took it because there", "07:00", "were photos of seeds at Walmart or", "07:03", "something where there's like tape saying", "07:04", "you can't you know this part of the", "07:05", "store is closed and so the story went", "07:07", "out that you weren't allowed to buy", "07:08", "seeds anymore no story actually was that", "07:11", "stores over 50,000 feet had to close off", "07:14", "non-essential areas like flooring and", "07:16", "gardening and things like that and who's", "07:18", "to determine what is and isn't essential", "07:20", "about any of those services particularly", "07:21", "gardening I mean if there's a time where", "07:24", "you want to have your own food readily", "07:26", "available in your back yard and at the", "07:27", "time well even think about just general", "07:29", "hardware if they're gonna shut that down", "07:31", "what if you what if hole breaks up in", "07:33", "your floor you know your kid falls", "07:35", "through or something yeah that fixed", "07:36", "yeah I mean that's that's a serious", "07:38", "safety issue so you've got these", "07:40", "governors determining what is essential", "07:42", "and what isn't I heard a good argument", "07:43", "for keeping liquor stores open because I", "07:45", "was like come on liquor stores but", "07:47", "someone said actually it is to prevent", "07:49", "people from going into detox from having", "07:52", "problems detoxing where they would take", "07:54", "up a hospital bed that we need", "07:56", "potentially need because of the virus I", "07:58", "that make sense I also think about the", "08:01", "reality of you take away booze in a time", "08:03", "of a crisis yeah and you're gonna see", "08:04", "people's nerves snap real quick have you", "08:06", "seen the video of this guy jogging down", "08:08", "the street he examines everybody's", "08:10", "recyclables it's all filled with vodka", "08:12", "bottles and tequila and whiskey and wine", "08:15", "and so it goes from house to house he's", "08:17", "like let's see what they've been up to", "08:18", "oh well people are so stressed out", "08:20", "they're just getting hammered yeah", "08:22", "that's me liver damage when this is all", "08:24", "a lot of horses - yeah I heard that's", "08:27", "that's going up Oh your people and", "08:29", "domestic abuse and /or and suicide", "08:31", "here's here's the prediction I made you", "08:33", "know very early on I was talking to my", "08:35", "friends actually I think I said this", "08:37", "what they're gonna do they're gonna say", "08:39", "we're only gonna keep things closed", "08:41", "until April 12th and that's what Trump", "08:43", "said at first Easter we're gonna come", "08:44", "open up and I said about a week before", "08:45", "they're gonna say no we gotta push it", "08:47", "back sure enough April 30th then May", "08:49", "15th now it's June 1st they're even", "08:51", "first for who we just I think New York", "08:54", "just announced", "08:54", "they said June first yeah but I think", "08:56", "they said they're gonna start May 15th", "08:59", "with outside of New York City right", "09:01", "there's not that Cuomo said I'm not", "09:03", "entirely sure but feel like you said", "09:04", "there I do know a lot of jurisdictions", "09:06", "have slowly entered you know the phase", "09:08", "one there was that Trump argument with", "09:10", "with camp and in Georgia about going too", "09:12", "fast and stuff like that yeah so I guess", "09:14", "you know people starting to realize if", "09:17", "you don't open things up there's nothing", "09:19", "to save right right what's what's", "09:21", "freaking to me about all of this is the", "09:23", "tribalism behind whether or not we", "09:25", "should reopen the economy or stay locked", "09:27", "down it's connected to everything right", "09:29", "what do you mean the tribalism it's can", "09:30", "I totally yeah it's it's it's so you", "09:33", "know I had a friend messaging me saying", "09:35", "we're stupid people who want haircuts", "09:37", "are gonna get us all killed and they're", "09:39", "going on protesting and and the first", "09:41", "thing I'm like you really don't think", "09:43", "just because one guy was holding that", "09:44", "dumb science what everyone is thinking", "09:46", "right now that's not the case but what's", "09:48", "crazy to me is you had the UN a UN", "09:50", "adviser come out and say we're looking", "09:52", "at a hundred and thirty million people", "09:53", "are going to starve because of the", "09:55", "economic shutdown and that's gonna be", "09:57", "much worse potentially than the actual", "09:59", "pandemic itself and these kind of facts", "10:02", "are ignored because of the tribalism but", "10:04", "what's happening you know Trump tweets", "10:05", "it out therefore it's an outright left", "10:06", "you know conservative whatever I don't", "10:08", "think they know exactly what to do I", "10:10", "mean I think there's some educated", "10:12", "decisions that are being made by medical", "10:15", "professionals and then they have to", "10:16", "adjust those based on new statistics", "10:19", "that come in and I don't know if they", "10:20", "have adjusted like the the initial idea", "10:23", "was that there was an X amount of people", "10:25", "that were infected in California yeah it", "10:27", "turns out there's many many many more", "10:28", "and the most recent thought is that", "10:31", "there's somewhere around 400,000 now", "10:33", "there has been some dispute about these", "10:35", "studies you know whether or not these", "10:37", "studies are accurate whether or not the", "10:39", "tests are accurate whether or not you", "10:42", "could get it again whether or not even", "10:43", "matters if you've already had it you", "10:45", "might be able to get it again but", "10:46", "there's no adjustments and no one's", "10:49", "saying hey this is way less deadly than", "10:51", "we thought it was going to be you know", "10:54", "there is this sounds like the problem of", "10:56", "government yeah I've never been one of", "10:58", "these small government types I'm you", "11:01", "know as much as people might want to", "11:02", "argue it with me I lean a little bit", "11:04", "left and a lot of issues like government", "11:05", "programs I think are good things it just", "11:07", "seems like whenever the government", "11:08", "something it's so slow to fix it if it", "11:11", "goes bad or when things change right so", "11:13", "slow to adjust if they need to shift", "11:15", "back they tend to just dump more money", "11:17", "into it if it's not working properly I", "11:19", "want to know why some people just shake", "11:22", "this off that's to me the most for this", "11:25", "it almost seems like you're dealing with", "11:26", "more than one virus it's like you're", "11:28", "dealing with a bunch of different", "11:30", "versions of a virus I think you are I", "11:32", "think they've they've said they found", "11:33", "multiple strains like that it changed a", "11:36", "little bit or something hmm I don't want", "11:38", "to know for sure I know they did say", "11:40", "that about India they said that the the", "11:42", "strain that they have in India is", "11:44", "apparently very different than the", "11:45", "strain they're experiencing in Europe", "11:46", "yeah I think some I heard something", "11:49", "similar about like Washington they found", "11:51", "two strains liberal and conservative", "11:53", "strains yeah yeah yeah it's the crazy", "11:56", "thing to me is the people a lot of Trump", "11:58", "supporters I don't want to blanket every", "12:00", "single one but there's some high-profile", "12:01", "ones that are really acting like since", "12:03", "the beginning they've doubted at every", "12:04", "step of the way and I'm like have you", "12:07", "looked at the spike charts", "12:08", "if you know here's what I say if in New", "12:10", "York City we're seeing thousands more", "12:11", "dead what are they dying of if not some", "12:14", "kind of you know infection I mean you", "12:17", "can call whatever you want you can act", "12:18", "like nothing's going on but we're seeing", "12:19", "huge spikes at camp attention to them", "12:21", "there's fools no matter what you do", "12:23", "there's always gonna be fools

just dismiss", "12:32", "that stuff you can't even debate or", "12:35", "dwell on it but what's interesting to me", "12:37", "is well there's a bunch of parts that", "12:39", "are interesting but what's interesting", "12:40", "to me is like who like George is opened", "12:44", "right and then parts of Montana of opens", "12:47", "there's things that are open in Texas", "12:49", "yeah like it's gonna be interesting to", "12:50", "see what the response is going to be", "12:53", "whether or not they come back online", "12:55", "quicker and their economy builds up", "12:57", "quicker or whether or not they get a", "12:59", "second surge and they've shut down", "13:00", "longer and it winds up being that maybe", "13:02", "should have waited longer and when add", "13:04", "less infection like we just saw a city", "13:07", "of 10 million in China enter lockdown", "13:08", "again did this to what degree I'm not", "13:11", "entirely sure but they've announced", "13:12", "they're you know

"no they just you know take up in the", "106:58", "ship Probie on a MicroBot need to this", "107:00", "is the thing about putting things up", "107:01", "your butt most doctors don't even do", "107:04", "that like they have MRIs now tenant", "107:06", "aliens need to probe you in your ass I", "107:08", "think it's just what everyone's afraid", "107:09", "of they're afraid of things go in their", "107:11", "ass so that's what they they think is", "107:13", "gonna happen if the aliens get them a", "107:14", "little fries me somebody somebody told", "107:16", "the dumb story back in the day and it", "107:18", "was the most sensational version", "107:19", "everybody had to have it so they were", "107:20", "like that's what they went with you know", "107:22", "maybe or maybe they do that to keep you", "107:25", "to keep your mouth shut", "107:26", "they fuck you in the ass just so you", "107:28", "keep your mouth shut or some dude", "107:29", "actually got abducted right yeah", "107:31", "and he comes back and he's like they", "107:32", "think they won against me they think", "107:34", "they beat me they puts up with my butt", "107:35", "they're weirdos do you hear the story of", "107:37", "Betty and Barney Hill now it's the very", "107:40", "first UFO abduction story it's an", "107:43", "ancient story and what's crazy is Angela", "107:46", "Hill who's a UFC fighter I had her on", "107:48", "the podcast and after the show she told", "107:51", "me her grandpa was Barney Hill whoa and", "107:54", "I was like holy fuck like we forgot to", "107:56", "we didn't talk about it during the show", "107:58", "but she wanted to bring it up because", "107:58", "she knows I'm kind of obsessed with UFOs", "108:00", "but the account that they have like they", "108:03", "get hypnotized and he's recalling the", "108:06", "abduction and they have like the same", "108:08", "story it's very terrifying they hear him", "108:10", "crying and screaming and you know that", "108:13", "he was taken aboard this craft and", "108:15", "examined and brought back and they have", "108:16", "missing time but here's the thing if", "108:18", "they only did that occasionally they", "108:20", "only came down once every few years and", "108:22", "just scoop some person up in the middle", "108:24", "of some rural place like if you're", "108:27", "flying over you know I think their", "108:29", "instance was in I believe it was in", "108:31", "Maine if you're flying over somewhere", "108:33", "like Maine which is a very low", "108:34", "population state and you see a lone car", "108:37", "and it's just traveling along the", "108:39", "highway and there's places in Maine", "108:40", "where you go from like Portland to", "108:42", "Bangor when you're traveling on that", "108:45", "road it's like 60 miles with nothing not", "108:48", "a gas station nothing if you were an", "108:52", "alien you saw a car by itself like no", "108:54", "other car will move in we got one", "108:56", "isn't it just easier to think it's the", "108:58", "US government no why not because we", "109:01", "don't have the capability of doing", "109:02", "something like that", "109:03", "think I don't think the capability of", "109:05", "the scientists working for the", "109:07", "government is any different than the", "109:09", "capability of the science scientists", "109:11", "that are working for you know Project X", "109:14", "or you know fill in the blanks in terms", "109:17", "of like what Raytheon publicly traded", "109:21", "companies how long look yet quadcopters", "109:25", "don't seem all that complicated to me", "109:27", "quadcopters yeah like a helicopter like", "109:29", "you drums you know we've seen a little", "109:30", "toys you buy they got four propellers", "109:32", "take take that concept use thinner you", "109:35", "know jets and surround it in a disc so", "109:38", "that it's you know universally like it", "109:40", "can move in any direction because it's", "109:42", "gotten you know source where's the gas", "109:45", "tank", "109:45", "well lithium-ion battery or come on", "109:49", "you're talking space shit like this", "109:51", "hasn't even been invented yet think", "109:53", "about how little mileage you can get out", "109:55", "of a Tesla", "109:56", "you know they had advances Tesla's you", "109:58", "know still when it's going full out it", "110:01", "can only go for I mean you get three", "110:03", "hundred seven miles if you drive like a", "110:05", "grandma but if you drive like a maniac", "110:06", "you don't even you'd have that you know", "110:09", "that they could be wrong with this but", "110:10", "I'm pretty sure that they had this", "110:12", "flying platform in the 70s that uses gas", "110:14", "power and they've also had jetpacks for", "110:16", "a long time know they've had sort of", "110:18", "they've had jet packs that are capable", "110:20", "of going for like thirty seconds they", "110:22", "don't exactly know no I'm pretty sure", "110:24", "the jet packs back in the day went for a", "110:26", "long no no they definitely didn't we can", "110:28", "lay it out yeah let's look it up because", "110:29", "I didn't the whole thing was the fact", "110:31", "they were burning gas and to propel you", "110:34", "in the air they only had a certain", "110:35", "amount I thought it was like 20 minutes", "110:37", "20-30 minutes maybe now my understanding", "110:40", "of why we abandoned jetpack technology", "110:42", "was that it was inefficient and heavy", "110:43", "and you couldn't carry it without it", "110:45", "being turned on so they opted for larger", "110:48", "like you know like what are they called", "110:50", "Chinook's helicopters that can carry", "110:52", "multiple people multiple people at once", "110:54", "when you're wearing a jet pack it has to", "110:56", "be on idle", "110:57", "negating its own weight which means it's", "111:00", "burning as you're walking around which", "111:01", "means you get a good 20-minute jump and", "111:03", "you gotta abandon the tech and then you", "111:04", "don't want your enemies to get it have", "111:06", "you ever seen a guy flyer jet pack yeah", "111:07", "as a video on youtube no I mean in real", "111:09", "life oh I've seen that one guy the Iron", "111:11", "Man dude what real life in there and", "111:13", "really my friend Willie be from in", "111:14", "Denver on the radio yeah", "111:16", "had a radio show in the morning h2s", "111:18", "radio show he still has a radio show", "111:21", "shout out to Willie and he had this guy", "111:24", "who was a jet pack pilot who came in and", "111:28", "in the parking lot of the radio studio", "111:30", "and you know fans of the radio show came", "111:32", "and did it too and watched it rather and", "111:34", "this guy flew in the air for about 15-20", "111:37", "seconds and then landed this guy was so", "111:39", "banged up he both of his legs were blown", "111:42", "apart he had he had big braces on both", "111:46", "of his knees I'm like what happened your", "111:48", "knees he's like just crash landing both", "111:49", "knees are blown to shit hit no ACLs and", "111:52", "either one of his knees but what I'm", "111:54", "saying like this is back then right good", "111:57", "for about 30 seconds 10 seconds of", "112:00", "flying well so the point I'm trying to", "112:02", "get to is if you take something like a", "112:03", "quadcopter you could absolutely feel it", "112:06", "with with you know gasps loud as fuck it", "112:09", "but it would it would depending on how", "112:11", "you measure engine to be an engine yeah", "112:13", "it'd be loud as fuck and you'd hear from", "112:16", "the from the quadrotor yeah but these", "112:17", "what these people are describing is", "112:20", "nothing like that these people are", "112:21", "describing things that are silent that", "112:23", "go from zero to a thousand miles an hour", "112:26", "in a split second the things that defy", "112:28", "physics as we understand them this is", "112:31", "not something that I think that the u.s.", "112:32", "government has I don't I just if you", "112:35", "look at like okay like Elon Musk company", "112:37", "project X or SpaceX SpaceX is right now", "112:41", "one of the premier civilian companies", "112:45", "private companies that's making rocket", "112:47", "ships they fuck up all the time total", "112:49", "there in the middle of innovating all", "112:50", "the time he's one of the smartest people", "112:51", "on earth he's one of the in terms of", "112:54", "Technology he's one he knows as much", "112:56", "about propulsion as anyone and they", "112:58", "still can't get it right they're still", "112:59", "trying to figure it out they're trying", "113:01", "to come up with something that could be", "113:02", "viable in terms of commercial space", "113:05", "flight and they're working on it daily", "113:07", "and these these people are the brightest", "113:10", "minds we know of right now they're in", "113:12", "this jet propulsion space travel", "113:15", "business there's you know virgins", "113:18", "working on something as a couple other", "113:20", "companies that are working on things as", "113:21", "well and then you have NASA which worked", "113:23", "they're the best they could come up with", "113:25", "was the Space Shuttle right do you think", "113:27", "that there was something way better than", "113:28", "Space Shuttle they just met", "113:30", "we used that they had and they they kept", "113:32", "it on the back burner didn't want to let", "113:34", "anybody know but the way they would use", "113:35", "it is they would pick people up and", "113:36", "erase their memory and exhort their", "113:38", "asshole that's crazy well that's less", "113:41", "likely than the hundreds of billions of", "113:44", "galaxies just in our own in our own", "113:48", "known universe right each one with", "113:51", "hundreds of billions of stars each star", "113:53", "with who knows how many fucking planets", "113:55", "that's somewhere out there there's", "113:57", "something more advanced than us maybe a", "113:59", "thousand years maybe a million years but", "114:01", "that it's figured out how to come here I", "114:02", "got same question then why hasn't why", "114:05", "isn't anyone discovered them", "114:06", "why is SETI failed search search for", "114:09", "extraterrestrial intelligence why", "114:11", "haven't the chimps invented guns", "114:12", "they've started using more tools but", "114:15", "right why haven't they invented guns", "114:16", "though I don't know so why hasn't said", "114:18", "he found UFOs the same fucking answer", "114:20", "they're not advanced enough yet really", "114:22", "it's a it's a real simple answer the", "114:24", "Industrial Age is a pretty fucking", "114:26", "recent right I mean you think about when", "114:28", "people invented cars you're talking", "114:29", "about 1800 that's really recent and we", "114:32", "call these lights 1800s like high power", "114:35", "radio transmission is only in the past", "114:37", "100 years or so right well you saw it", "114:39", "you've seen the movie contact maybe", "114:41", "that's the old one right it's Jodie", "114:43", "Foster and Matthew McConaughey it's a", "114:45", "based on Carl Sagan's book about contact", "114:48", "with space and with with aliens I think", "114:51", "I did see it recently I can interesting", "114:52", "interesting take on it but oh yeah way", "114:54", "is that they've received the signal that", "114:57", "we sent out way way back you know in the", "115:00", "day actually when the the first", "115:03", "broadcast signal was Hitler announcing", "115:06", "the Olympic Games to start of the Berlin", "115:08", "games and this was the first signal they", "115:10", "got there's a really controversial", "115:11", "moment in the movie or controversy it", "115:13", "you know in the plot with that once they", "115:16", "were trying to decipher the image that", "115:19", "was being sent they realize it was", "115:20", "Hitler yeah", "115:21", "the first thing they see is a swastika", "115:23", "what the fuck is this send it back to us", "115:25", "and then they had to realize oh no no", "115:27", "this is the first image that we sent out", "115:29", "to space they wouldn't be able to", "115:30", "understand the political or historical", "115:32", "context of this and well so so I got a", "115:35", "few there's a few issues I see in terms", "115:37", "of aliens and earth contact right", "115:40", "we are substantially more connected", "115:43", "you know in an evolutionary chain - ants", "115:45", "than we are to any alien so we we can't", "115:49", "communicate with them for the most part", "115:51", "we kind of can we understand how they", "115:52", "communicate but when an ant sees a", "115:54", "superhighway there's something like this", "115:55", "is someone else's quote they don't think", "115:57", "twice", "115:58", "so it's possible there are aliens that", "116:00", "have super highways right above us we", "116:01", "can't tell what it is same as a dog", "116:03", "doesn't understand other than state", "116:04", "government but one of the one of the", "116:06", "issues I think is often neglected in the", "116:08", "conversation about aliens is the we", "116:11", "assume aliens would be on a very similar", "116:13", "planet to us we assume that they would", "116:15", "have some kind of gaseous atmosphere", "116:16", "perhaps it's a liquid atmosphere and one", "116:19", "of the things that I would ask of a", "116:21", "researchers I'm not the expert is the", "116:22", "fact that we have the proper balance of", "116:24", "oxygen the atmosphere to manipulate fire", "116:26", "which allows us to you know separate", "116:28", "elements and then create computers and", "116:31", "components and fuels wouldn't exist on a", "116:34", "planet without the same you know", "116:36", "atmosphere we existed to stop I can", "116:37", "answer that really easy yeah", "116:38", "there's no known propulsion system for", "116:40", "any of these crafts these things are not", "116:42", "using fire they don't have a heat signal", "116:44", "there they don't know what they are they", "116:46", "don't know how that works I don't mean", "116:48", "propulsion I mean the separation of", "116:49", "elements the manipulation of elements", "116:51", "right so we we melt things and separate", "116:54", "them and break them down they don't", "116:56", "believe that that's how it works no but", "116:58", "I mean like how do you even start from", "116:59", "I'm sure there's an answer you know", "117:01", "let's say you have you have a species", "117:03", "that lives on a planet with no oxygen it", "117:05", "has no access to fire what energy like", "117:07", "what dense energy source do they have", "117:08", "that will allow them to manipulate", "117:10", "matter do you know the Rob Lazar the bob", "117:13", "lazar story I do yeah well one of the", "117:15", "things that he talked about when he", "117:18", "first stopped working for area s4 and", "117:21", "the government was tapping his phones", "117:23", "and you know there's there's a lot that", "117:25", "can be documented about him there's a", "117:26", "lot that can't be but one of the things", "117:28", "that he talked about was a thing called", "117:29", "element 115 right that element 115 this", "117:32", "is insanely dense element that they use", "117:34", "to bend gravity and that the way he", "117:37", "described the way the propulsion system", "117:39", "works it's like putting a bowling ball", "117:41", "in the center of a very soft mattress", "117:43", "and that all of the other mattress all", "117:46", "the rest of the mess the mattress bends", "117:48", "around the intense mass of the bowling", "117:50", "ball and that this is how these", "117:52", "incredibly advanced aliens from this", "117:55", "other planet use", "117:57", "this is their propulsion system that was", "117:59", "used from Star Trek though the the", "118:02", "concept of warp was all around for a", "118:05", "really long I think the concept is based", "118:08", "on Einstein's theory of gravity I mean", "118:11", "this is the whole idea if you could find", "118:12", "something that could do that but here's", "118:14", "the thing", "118:15", "when Bob Lazar talked about this in the", "118:18", "late 80s early 90s this element didn't", "118:21", "exist right now it does it wasn't it", "118:23", "wasn't proven until they did it in a", "118:25", "particle collider I believe it was 2013", "118:28", "so he was talking about this element far", "118:30", "before it was it was and he's apparently", "118:33", "this is the big rumor he apparently had", "118:36", "taken some of that from a lab yeah and", "118:39", "through George Noory and it was a George", "118:41", "Noory yes they did some experiments on", "118:44", "the on television and showed that this", "118:47", "stuff had made light and fog bend in a", "118:51", "way that they couldn't describe he also", "118:54", "didn't he also claimed to see a small", "118:55", "alien creature on his way out he said he", "118:57", "saw something that was sitting down but", "118:59", "he doesn't know if it was a model that", "119:01", "they were using like if they had created", "119:03", "something that was supposed to be the", "119:05", "size of a thing that could fit in these", "119:07", "crafts because these crafts he said", "119:09", "we're designed for things that were far", "119:11", "smaller than human beings I'm pretty", "119:13", "sure in the initial interview he gave", "119:14", "when he went public was that he saw an", "119:16", "alien and then later on changed it", "119:18", "saying I don't know if it was maybe a", "119:19", "model or a puppet yeah he said he", "119:21", "thought he saw something sitting down", "119:23", "and two people standing over it looking", "119:25", "at it he said he thought he saw an alien", "119:26", "you know but he's probably I mean I", "119:30", "don't know I mean look he said it was", "119:31", "literally for like a half a second look", "119:33", "it's walking by a window and he sees", "119:35", "something inside of it imagine being a", "119:37", "guy who's in your 20s and you're a", "119:39", "propulsions expert and it's been proved", "119:41", "and he worked at Los Alamos labs has", "119:43", "been proven that he did put a fucking", "119:44", "jet engine yeah it's been proven that he", "119:47", "did put a jet engine on a Honda I mean", "119:49", "he's a genius he's a and then you talk", "119:51", "to him he's an incredibly smart guy now", "119:53", "imagine you get sent off to area s4 and", "119:56", "they show you this thing that you know", "119:58", "doesn't even exist and they tell you", "120:00", "about this propulsion method that they", "120:01", "don't understand and they say that they", "120:03", "found this a long time ago in an", "120:05", "archeological dig and they want you to", "120:08", "back engineer it because you're a", "120:10", "propulsion", "120:10", "expert and they're running out of", "120:12", "options they've been studying this for", "120:14", "decades no one knows what the fuck it is", "120:15", "or how you can make it work and then", "120:18", "they do test flights with this thing and", "120:19", "then he tells his friends about these", "120:22", "test flights after he gets fucked you", "120:24", "know I got fired do you know a story", "120:25", "about him getting fired he leaked it or", "120:27", "something no no his wife is fucking her", "120:29", "flight instructor oh and so when his", "120:31", "wife was fucking her flight instructor", "120:32", "they told him he couldn't work anymore", "120:34", "and he's like why not well they were", "120:35", "tapping his phone because when you have", "120:37", "top-secret clearance to work on UFOs I", "120:39", "guess they don't want your fight your", "120:40", "your wife fucking her flight instructor", "120:43", "then you're gonna go crazy and you have", "120:45", "a lot of imbalance at home right so he", "120:49", "doesn't know why they don't tell him why", "120:51", "so he takes his friends and he tells", "120:53", "them listen this is this is real they're", "120:55", "running these experiments I know you", "120:57", "think I'm crazy this is what I've been", "120:59", "working on so he takes them to this area", "121:01", "where you used to be able to have access", "121:03", "to but once he did this they closed off", "121:04", "access and pushed it far back to where", "121:06", "the public has access to and he showed", "121:09", "them these things doing these impossible", "121:11", "maneuvers in the desert in the night sky", "121:13", "as I remember and so then he gets", "121:15", "arrested and so when he gets arrested he", "121:17", "was a fear he was in fear of his own", "121:19", "life he goes public and tells this whole", "121:21", "story and then they erase his past they", "121:23", "erased his social security number they", "121:25", "erase his education background even", "121:27", "though

videos coming out", "127:05", "showing like ember watch primate species", "127:07", "but using more tools yeah will this be", "127:08", "your undead stuff they believe that", "127:10", "primates

they had a", "127:27", "civilization you can go to you knew they", "127:29", "lived in an apartment and you can study", "127:31", "them that way but you don't think that", "127:33", "they would study if they found a planet", "127:35", "like it looks the magic if we found a", "127:37", "planet okay we found a planet and it's", "127:39", "all just filled with octopus and these", "127:41", "octopus are changing colors and just", "127:43", "Jack and fish and eaten lobsters we", "127:45", "would be so it'd be fascinating", "127:47", "absolutely well all innovation happens", "127:51", "because

we would have to", "128:32", "be incredibly curious and incredibly not", "128:37", "just curious but innovative they would", "128:40", "have to be thinking about things they", "128:42", "would have to

full of shit", "128:53", "they lie to each other constantly send", "128:55", "videos through the air they have weapons", "128:57", "that they could blow each other up with", "128:59", "yeah I mean of course you would be", "129:00", "fascinated by that is the least", "129:02", "compelling argument", "129:04", "that anybody ever says why would they", "129:06", "mess with us why would they care about", "129:08", "us of course they would care about us we", "129:10", "are fucking interesting well I'll put", "129:13", "this way I think if we saw like a group", "129:14", "of chimps standing near like a water", "129:17", "water bed and then one chimp fashioned", "129:19", "some kind of bag and pulls it over its", "129:20", "head jumps in the water and tries to go", "129:23", "as low as he can for as long as I can", "129:24", "but before coming back out we would look", "129:26", "at that like that is the stupidest", "129:27", "attempt at scuba diving I've ever seen", "129:29", "but oh my god a chimp just tried to", "129:31", "scuba dive so if there are aliens and", "129:33", "they're in these amazing technologically", "129:35", "advanced ships that can jump Lightspeed", "129:37",

"129:44", "the in stupidest attempt that actually", "129:47", "go into space he's guys trying to go to", "129:49", "space no I wouldn't think about that way", "129:50", "at all I would think about look there's", "129:52", "a fucking Space Station it's up there", "129:54", "and people live on it they shoot", "129:55", "themselves is that they have a very", "129:57", "crude form of propulsion right but they", "129:59", "have figured it out because they don't", "130:00", "have element 115 in their environment", "130:02", "naturally so these dummies have to light", "130:04", "things on fire and usually push off the", "130:06", "back of it to shove themselves through", "130:08", "normal air and you know why they're not", "130:10", "gonna give us that Tech right now why", "130:11", "would they give us that why why do I say", "130:13", "give us tax why they wouldn't I'm saying", "130:15", "why would they give us tech why would", "130:16", "any that's the weirdest argument ever", "130:19", "that they're giving us things I don't", "130:20", "think they're giving a shit no I don't", "130:22", "think so either I think they're", "130:23", "specifically not doing it and they", "130:24", "wouldn't do it even if we wanted them to", "130:26", "I think I think it's the inverse you you", "130:29", "people a lot of people talk about how", "130:32", "they're like sharing technology with us", "130:33", "or something right you see that stuff in", "130:35", "the conspirators conspiracies", "130:37", "the reason they won't is because we're", "130:39", "we're trust we're territorial we we", "130:41", "fight each other I'm sure so look if", "130:43", "they came down and went to Russia and", "130:45", "said here's anti-graft propulsion we", "130:48", "think Russia is gonna do all right our", "130:49", "planet now they're gonna immediately", "130:50", "expand rapidly their population is gonna", "130:53", "grow exponentially and it's gonna cause", "130:55", "massive turmoil between nuclear powers", "130:57", "which could destroy themselves", "130:58", "so you can use it as a weapon the", "131:01", "smartest thing is to not share at all", "131:03", "until we're a one-world you know Society", "131:06", "well also like look at what they look", "131:07", "like when aliens look like if you look", "131:09", "at the iconic shape of an alien they", "131:11", "have giant heads and genderless bodies", "131:13", "like maybe that's the key to to stopping", "131:16", "war with the north", "131:18", "no incentive whatsoever for people to be", "131:22", "sexual or attractive everybody looks", "131:25", "exactly the same we get over this idea", "131:27", "of biological mating they reproduce", "131:30", "through genetic engineering why not just", "131:33", "be robots well maybe they are like yeah", "131:35", "that's me that is like a robot", "131:36", "artificial bodies where you you know", "131:38", "have you seen altered carbon I haven't", "131:41", "but I keep hearing good things about it", "131:42", "I just finished season 2 season 1 was", "131:44", "awesome but basically they have a thing", "131:45", "called a stack you said you finished", "131:46", "season 2 season 1 is awesome that means", "131:48", "season 2 sucks", "131:49", "season 2 is a C+ Oh season 1 second a", "131:51", "plus plus yeah like it's fun but they", "131:55", "have a thing called a stack in the base", "131:57", "of their in their in their spinal column", "131:58", "right below their their head that stores", "132:00", "their consciousness and they call their", "132:02", "bodies sleeves and they kind of don't", "132:05", "care when they die because they just get", "132:07", "you know it's if you're poor you get", "132:08", "really crappy sleeves right but if", "132:10", "you're if you're rich you get premium", "132:12", "access military upgrade like high tech", "132:14", "very strong but their body has just", "132:16", "become separate and you can also", "132:18", "transport your consciousness", "132:20", "interstellar like to other planets and", "132:22", "then you wake up in a body in a", "132:23", "different plant that's how you go places", "132:24", "now your consciousness travels so yeah I", "132:27", "mean maybe aliens do that maybe there's", "132:30", "there's not you know I'm I find the the", "132:34", "idea of the various alien life but the", "132:35", "body's curious one of the one of the", "132:37", "things I've read about is that it could", "132:39", "be humans from the future yeah I've", "132:41", "heard that - that makes sense you think", "132:43", "about what we look like as opposed to", "132:44", "like what a champ looks like yeah and", "132:46", "then you keep going further with that", "132:47", "like oh the head will get bigger the", "132:48", "bodies get weaker yeah and then look", "132:51", "there's a sort of a trend in this", "132:52", "society today to be less masculine less", "132:56", "feminine more gender-neutral and these", "133:00", "well so they them pronouns maybe that's", "133:02", "all just part of the programming this", "133:03", "this falls into another one of these", "133:05", "conspiracy theories that the goal of the", "133:07", "globalists is that in order to get", "133:08", "access to alien tech we have to be a", "133:10", "unified planet aliens aren't going to", "133:13", "give aliens really you've heard that one", "133:15", "oh yeah it's all over the Internet the", "133:16", "that's why they're doing this so that", "133:18", "they're going with a one-world order in", "133:20", "order to get alien tech do you think the", "133:23", "Galactic Federation is gonna gonna let a", "133:24", "planet in which has got numerous", "133:26", "governing bodies and nuclear weapons", "133:27", "there's a Galactic Federation think I'm", "133:30", "just", "133:30", "right about the point I'm making is", "133:32", "they're people and I believe this they", "133:33", "believe that if there is some kind of", "133:35", "Galactic Federation or at least some", "133:37", "kind of recognizable you know different", "133:40", "cultures that have some kind of set rule", "133:41", "base right who do they negotiate with us", "133:43", "Russia or China and so the argument the", "133:46", "one of the theories is that interest on", "133:50", "the United States who have access to the", "133:51", "aliens know that they have to do", "133:53", "everything their power to unify the", "133:54", "entire planet under one Authority so", "133:56", "that we can be entered into whatever", "133:58", "alien you know access would exist but so", "134:01", "long as we are nuclear-powered competing", "134:03", "territorial factions they can't do it", "134:06", "well that makes sense if that was the", "134:08", "case but you add in what you what you", "134:10", "were saying about masculinity and gender", "134:12", "and one of the things that I find", "134:15", "interesting is that when it comes to", "134:16", "this argument about removing masculinity", "134:18", "there's this kind of overlap with this", "134:20", "idea of domestication you think about", "134:22", "proto twelves proto dogs and dogs dogs", "134:25", "are effectively wolf cubs perpetually so", "134:28", "wolves are aggressive territorial", "134:31", "independent yeah I mean independent the", "134:33", "sense that like you you're not gonna", "134:34", "tame them they're like you know teach", "134:35", "wolves yeah yeah willing to listen to", "134:38", "you there I mean I you you can but it's", "134:40", "like it's it's Sarah they agree with you", "134:43", "or they don't you're following you know", "134:44", "so an adult masculine tough human is", "134:47", "gonna be like I'm independent I'm in", "134:49", "charge they've got to remove that and", "134:51", "domesticate us so you get a bunch of", "134:53", "weak effeminate genderless humans who", "134:55", "are gonna be passive docile and", "134:56", "agreeable", "134:57", "yeah like dogs right yeah do I have a", "134:59", "whole bit about what wolves are and what", "135:02", "dogs are yeah and what men used to be", "135:04", "right and what men are now yeah I I was", "135:07", "thinking of this really cool idea for a", "135:08", "sci-fi film where aliens come to earth", "135:10", "and most humanity accepts domestication", "135:13", "and then 300 400 years from now you've", "135:16", "got regular looking 21st century kind of", "135:18", "men and women but then you have these", "135:19", "five-foot tall super armored jet pack", "135:22", "with plasma rifles that love and serve", "135:26", "the aliens and we view them as freakish", "135:29", "genetic defects so have you seen like", "135:33", "oblivion with Tom Cruise yes", "135:35", "the aliens basically genetically", "135:37", "engineered a whole bunch of Tom Cruise's", "135:38", "I was thinking of that kind of idea but", "135:40", "also with domestic Asia that's an", "135:41", "underrated movie by the way that's cool", "135:42", "I love it", "135:43", "yeah very good", "135:44", "if if aliens came to earth and most", "135:47", "humans agreed and then over time the", "135:49", "humans that got access to life-saving", "135:51", "technology special armor were the ones", "135:54", "that were agreeable and less likely to", "135:56", "be aggressive yeah they would bitch out", "135:58", "just like the Wolves bitched out and", "135:59", "became a pole and then you'd have wolves", "136:01", "so I thought of a cool idea for a story", "136:03", "you basically
