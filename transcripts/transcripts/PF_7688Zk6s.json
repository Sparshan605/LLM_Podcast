hypersomnia so I spent all my time", "11:39", "googling reading papers trying to get a", "11:42", "background on skin disorders and", "11:44", "eventually I came across this celiac", "11:47", "disease rash online and that's what I", "11:50", "had it looked exactly the same so I cut", "11:54", "out gluten I read a whole bunch about", "11:55", "like the effects of gluten on the gut", "11:57", "and thought oh there's actually some", "11:59", "evidence that gluten isn't good for", "12:00", "people why aren't people being told this", "12:02", "like why didn't my doctor test me for", "12:04",

"12:13", "don't test kids with arthritis for", "12:15", "celiac disease so I cut out gluten and", "12:17", "that kind of helped maybe like 20% but", "12:20", "it was hard to tell because it was the", "12:21", "summer I was like maybe I'm just feeling", "12:23", "better from the summer", "12:24", "my rash kind of went down but it was", "12:26", "still there and then so September 2015", "12:30", "my mom dragged me to a naturopath and", "12:33", "they gave me this sheet of foods and", "12:34", "like try this elimination diet and I", "12:36", "looked at the sheet and thought this", "12:37", "doesn't make any sense like why can I", "12:39", "eat lemons and not oranges and why are", "12:40", "almonds on there but other nuts are off", "12:43", "so I cut so I thought okay if I'm gonna",

for help", "13:38", "anyway I cut down so I was eating mostly", "13:41", "like green vegetables I was still eating", "13:43", "rice at that point because I thought", "13:45", "everybody eats rice rice is safe and", "13:47", "meat but I cut out like dairy most", "13:50", "grains soy sugar processed foods and", "13:55", "then in the next month my joints got way", "14:00", "better and my skin healed and my skin", "14:02", "never healed like for a couple years I'd", "14:05", "always have these flare-ups and never", "14:07", "went away and that was just on a like", "14:09", "relatively low carb diet just like just", "14:12", "less I don't know I was still eating", "14:14", "rice right but it was still mostly meat", "14:16", "and vegetables and I thought okay maybe", "14:19", "there's something to this and then I", "14:21", "made almond flour gluten free sugar free", "14:25", "dairy free almond flour banana muffins", "14:28", "and I ate a bunch of those one night and", "14:31", "I woke up and the next day my wrists", "14:32", "were sore and I thought okay maybe", "14:36", "that's weird and then I had a bunch more", "14:38", "of the muffins because the muffins were", "14:40", "good and and then I went away to a", "14:44", "cottage that weekend and I couldn't walk", "14:46", "cuz of my knees and I never had", "14:49", "flare-ups that badly like I used to get", "14:51", "my shoulder was always sore when I slept", "14:53", "so I took tylenol three at night for", "14:55", "sleeping and my wrists were stiff but I", "14:57", "never had like a flare-up like I", "14:59", "couldn't walk so that was that weekend", "15:02", "so then I went back to the diet and got", "15:05", "really strict with it and then things", "15:10", "were better like my skin was better I I", "15:12", "lost this was weird I lost five pounds", "15:15", "which wasn't a lot but I went down to", "15:17", "three pant sizes so it was all bloating", "15:20", "that I didn't realize was bloating cuz", "15:22", "it never fluctuated so that was the", "15:24", "first month and then 2015 and then I", "15:28", "started trying to reintroduce", "15:29", "foods because I was having cravings and", "15:31", "I missed going out to eat with my", "15:33", "friends and everything so I tried to", "15:35", "read the first thing I tries to", "15:36", "introduce was sour patch candy because I", "15:40", "was having really intense sugar don't", "15:43", "look at me like that I was having really", "15:45", "intense sugar cravings and I looked at", "15:47", "the packet and I thought okay no one's", "15:48", "allergic to put sugar there's no dairy", "15:52", "there's no gluten there's no soy this", "15:54", "will be fine and I really wanted to eat", "15:56", "them and I had those and the next day my", "16:00", "whole body was itchy again and it was", "16:02", "like like mosquito bites everywhere so I", "16:06", "thought okay maybe maybe that was a bad", "16:08", "idea so I waited a couple weeks and I", "16:10", "tried to reintroduce almond butter", "16:11", "organic almond butter cuz I wanted", "16:14", "something fast protein fast and then I", "16:17", "had it's like abdominal cramping", "16:21", "diarrhea then this itch came back Jesus", "16:24", "Christ yeah", "16:25", "so for the next year", "16:29", "well I'll slow down we've got some time", "16:31", "so that was that was the almond butter", "16:33", "so then I waited awhile and I felt", "16:35", "pretty good and this was November 2015", "16:36", "and then I started feeling really good", "16:39", "and I went off of my antidepressants and", "16:41", "I had been taking antidepressants since", "16:44", "I was in grade five a really high dose", "16:46", "of an SSRI which had been very helpful", "16:50", "but did you wean yourself off and do it", "16:53", "under a doctor's supervision", "16:55", "no I didn't I weaned myself down so I", "17:00", "went down to half and then I went to a", "17:01", "quarter and then I went to an eighth and", "17:03", "then I stopped taking how long two weeks", "17:05", "it was nothing really", "17:06", "over two weeks it was two weeks yeah I", "17:08", "didn't have withdrawal symptoms like I", "17:11", "think to me I was lucky that way and so", "17:14", "you died at this point was so at that", "17:16", "point I was eating rice occasionally but", "17:19", "it was mostly like broccoli salad", "17:22", "chicken beef fish you know olive oil", "17:26", "apple cider vinegar salt pepper at that", "17:29", "point I was also eating pears and apples", "17:31", "so it was kind

more", "17:45", "rashes yeah so everything seems to be", "17:46", "improving I was shocked when the", "17:48", "depression lifted because I thought that", "17:50", "runs in my family that's familial we", "17:52", "have some sort of brain chemistry", "17:54", "problem that can't possibly be diet I", "17:56", "thought I thought the skin maybe that", "17:58", "was diet because this gluten link and", "18:00", "then maybe because of the celiac gene", "18:03", "that I got tested for maybe the", "18:05", "Arthritis was part of that but I never", "18:06", "thought mood was associated with it so", "18:09", "that was a surprise in November anyway I", "18:12", "went off of the antidepressants and then", "18:14", "I'm about a month later I tried to", "18:16", "reintroduce soy and this is when things", "18:18", "started getting really weird that year", "18:21", "so I was having why you reintroducing", "18:24", "things if you're having all these", "18:25", "positive benefits I was having cravings", "18:27", "like crazy and I we missed eating out", "18:30", "and I thought there were probably like", "18:32", "four or five foods I was really", "18:34", "sensitive to and I if I could

because we didn't realize you", "25:55", "didn't need greens to survive so we were", "25:59", "eating meat and greens and then I have", "26:02", "to say mostly because we realized you", "26:04",

simple salad with like olive oil", "26:16", "apple cider vinegar salt pepper", "26:17", "cucumbers lettuces spinach pretty simple", "26:22", "salad and then meat and fish so we did", "26:26", "that

just me now for", "26:37", "some reason I've lost the tolerance to", "26:38", "these foods I used to be able to eat and", "26:40", "in your just eating salad and meat yeah", "26:44", "and I'm still having autoimmune so now", "26:47", "symptoms that you used to have not in", "26:49", "your eating not not nearly as bad not", "26:52", "nearly as bad like my fatigue wasn't", "26:54", "back my anxiety was manageable without", "26:56", "medication but you hadn't achieved the", "27:00", "levels of I didn't know that you had and", "27:02", "you were eliminating things from your", "27:04", "diet earlier yeah exactly exactly like I", "27:06", "reached a really good point and then I", "27:09", "got pregnant and I couldn't reach that", "27:10", "point again okay so then this is 2017 so", "27:15", "it's like November and I'm getting", "27:16", "really frustrated about being itchy I'm", "27:19", "just randomly itchy again and we", "27:20", "randomly or eating meat and meat and", "27:23", "salad yeah and I thought okay maybe I", "27:26", "just have an autoimmune disorder and I", "27:28", "can't control it with diet anymore", "27:31", "maybe this maybe I'm just stuck like", "27:33", "this and so I googled like out of", "27:35", "desperation I think I googled allergic", "27:37", "to everything", "27:37", "food wise something like that into", "27:39", "Google and I found this story about", "27:41", "Charlene Anderson who's been mentioned a", "27:43", "couple times and she'd been diagnosed", "27:44", "with Lyme disease and has been eating", "27:47", "nothing but like red meat for eighteen", "27:50", "years and there are pictures of her", "27:52", "family online and I thought okay I know", "27:56", "I'm not I think I googled allergic to", "27:57", "everything except meat oh so I found her", "28:00", "then I found that Shaun Baker episode", "28:03", "you did and he'd been doing it for two", "28:06", "years and I think that night I thought", "28:08", "screw it I literally have nothing to", "28:11", "lose here I'm only cutting out salad", "28:13", "so that's when I switched over that was", "28:16", "December and then I switched over and", "28:20", "the itching got better pretty quickly", "28:23", "like within the first couple of days but", "28:25", "then my digestion just got totally", "28:27", "screwed up so like bloating and diarrhea", "28:30", "every time I ate and after about a week", "28:32", "I thought okay this is a bad idea", "28:35", "obviously diary every time you ate meat", "28:37", "just me just me and salt roast yeah so I", "28:43", "thought this is a bad idea obviously", "28:44", "this isn't working my body doesn't like", "28:46", "it so I reintroduced salad", "28:47", "it was literally lettuce apple cider", "28:50", "vinegar olive oil and salt and pepper", "28:52", "that's what I reintroduce and I woke up", "28:55", "the next day and the itch was back and", "28:57", "my joints were stiff and I thought okay", "29:00", "if I have to choose between itching and", "29:03", "arthritis or diarrhea I'm gonna choose", "29:05", "the diarrhea I was in a rough place", "29:07", "mm-hmm yes so I stuck it out and at six", "29:12", "weeks of just doing this mind I'd the", "29:15", "bloating went away the diarrhea went", "29:17", "away and everything started to improve", "29:20", "so that was mid-january but I was still", "29:23", "pretty skeptical because I thought I", "29:25", "thought maybe the reason the carnivore", "29:27", "diet worked for people was because they", "29:28", "just accidentally cut out everything", "29:30", "that wasn't working for them processed", "29:33", "food sugar", "29:34", "you know grains all that so I tried to", "29:37", "reintroduce olives like organic olives", "29:39", "in olive oil and that was February and", "29:42", "then I had this itching came back with", "29:44", "the depression my skin broke out and it", "29:47", "was minor in comparison to like soy so", "29:49", "you think", "29:50", "essentially to give us the cliffnotes", "29:52", "you're allergic to everything", "29:54", "yeah it's like fucking crazy it's crazy", "30:00", "but then here's the thing I started this", "30:02", "blog so the blogs don't eat that mm-hmm", "30:04", "and I started this blog because I", "30:06", "thought if for some reason there's", "30:08", "someone else out there like me and", "30:09", "they're googling these things it'd be", "30:12", "nice for them to know that they're not", "30:13", "alone", "30:14", "right and I've found other people like", "30:16", "this who are equally as sensitive I'm", "30:19", "sure I mean look if you exist is there's", "30:21", "probably quite a few people that have", "30:22", "that issue look yeah it makes sense that", "30:25", "we all have different tolerances and we", "30:28", "all have different allergies mm-hm", "30:29", "some people are allergic to cats some", "30:31", "people have no problem with peanuts some", "30:33", "people eat a Brazil nut and they die yes", "30:36", "just we yeah we know this so the idea", "30:39", "this is one of the problems with diet is", "30:40", "that people want to think that a diet", "30:43", "that works for them works for everybody", "30:44", "and it doesn't work that way and things", "30:46", "and people want you to follow their diet", "30:48", "no matter what it is whether it's vegan", "30:50", "or paleo people are very ideological", "30:53", "with that they would love you for you to", "30:55", "do exactly what they're doing so to", "30:57", "reinforce what they're doing is correct", "31:01", "there's a lot of pushback against this", "31:03", "carnivore diet idea but I don't I don't", "31:09", "think it's outside the realm of", "31:10", "possibility that someone like you might", "31:11", "actually really be allergic to", "31:13", "everything yeah I mean I was like very", "31:17", "sick and from coming from that place to", "31:19", "now I can see how sick I was and it was", "31:21", "like I was dying a bunch of medication", "31:24", "did you ever do anything with probiotics", "31:27", "yeah I can't tolerate probiotics can't", "31:29", "tolerate them No so the original idea", "31:31", "was heal my gut mm-hmm repopulate with", "31:34", "bacteria that maybe I'm missing and then", "31:36", "maybe incorporate more foods right so", "31:38", "what happened we tried to that same", "31:40", "autoimmune flare-up okay but this is the", "31:43", "same autumn immune flare-up that you got", "31:45", "when you ain't salad no not quite not", "31:49", "quite as bad not it was different it was", "31:52", "like with salad there's more of the", "31:55", "arthritis mm-hmm", "31:57", "and like body pain and then with", "32:00", "probiotics would you get mood issues so", "32:02", "like really volatile and itchy right so", "32:06", "I still got the edge yeah so I think it", "32:09", "was I probably had leaky gut mm-hm and", "32:12", "so the probiotics was just going", "32:13", "everywhere one of the things your dad", "32:14", "brought up to me when he was here was", "32:16", "emulsifiers yeah yeah and then I started", "32:20", "reading up on it after he discussed it", "32:23", "with me and it's something that I never", "32:25", "even considered before but fast rising", "32:27", "yeast and all these different", "32:30", "emulsifiers that they put in bread and", "32:33", "and various foods mm-hmm they're", "32:35", "terrible for you oh my god yeah terrible", "32:38", "for your stomach in there they're so", "32:39", "prevalent", "32:40", "they're everywhere yeah soy lecithin", "32:41", "it's in everything it's and everything", "32:44", "yeah and then I started really paying", "32:45", "attention to it and I've read several", "32:46", "articles on it and in a couple of", "32:48", "studies it's it's crazy how this is", "32:51", "something that's never even discussed", "32:52", "and it has all sorts of negative effects", "32:56", "on your gut and your gut lining it's", "32:59", "awful", "33:00", "yeah combining that and then it looks", "33:02", "like grains aren't so good for people", "33:03", "combining that and grains it's no wonder", "33:07", "people are ill some people yeah some", "33:10", "people most people though if you look", "33:13", "like obesity or", "33:14", "I wouldn't go most I would say some I'd", "33:17",

"33:27", "great example but I mean people start", "33:30", "gaining weight if they're lucky when", "33:31", "they're middle-aged if they're unlucky", "33:33", "when they're around 25 and they start", "33:34", "gaining weight I don't think it's from", "33:36", "lack of exercise I think it's from diet", "33:37", "and yeah I think dying has a lot to do", "33:40", "with it", "33:40", "yeah for sure um but it's also lack of", "33:43", "exercise I don't know I'm not convinced", "33:46", "because people who've gone on to this", "33:49", "carnivore diet especially mm-hmm lose", "33:52", "that weight

out I was stressed out for the", "60:25", "whole day but it's like if it flares", "60:28", "first of all these flare-ups don't", "60:29", "happen instantly", "60:30", "so it gives you enough time to freak out", "60:31", "about if they're going to happen for a", "60:33", "couple of days right and then it's like", "60:35", "a month of an autoimmune disorder and", "60:37", "depression and brain fog

helps these reactions", "60:48", "is an infrared sauna if I get in there", "60:51", "like once a day and sweat only an", "60:53", "infrared one what about a regular one do", "60:56", "you know honestly no I don't know you", "60:58", "don't know so the idea just to elevated", "61:00", "heat temperature whether it's infrared", "61:02", "or not yeah I don't know if it's I've", "61:04", "just read all the benefits of infrared", "61:06", "mmm but I have benefits over a regular", "61:08", "sauna wow there's like longevity studies", "61:12", "from Finland those are done on a regular", "61:14", "sauna that's a regular sauna yeah the", "61:16", "ones that are done would that show the", "61:18", "decrease in mortality of 40 percent it's", "61:20", "a regular size regular sauna yeah why", "61:24", "don't you uh google that please there's", "61:27", "a state may be Rhonda Patrick has it up", "61:29", "on our website but because I asked her", "61:32", "whether I should get a regular sauna or", "61:33", "a infrared and she said the studies that", "61:35", "were done were done with a regular sauna", "61:37", "but she said the real issue is that your", "61:40", "body is producing heat shock proteins so", "61:42", "whether it's infrared or regular the", "61:43", "whole the real issue is your body's in", "61:45", "this extreme 107", "61:46", "degree temperature produces these", "61:48", "cytokines and these cytokine cytokines", "61:51", "and your body is reacting to this", "61:54", "incredible temperature and this is what", "61:57", "produces anti-inflammation effect I", "61:59", "would think for someone like you with", "62:00", "arthritis in particular anything that", "62:03", "reduces inflammation would be a great", "62:05", "benefit so yeah I know it's sorry be", "62:07", "awesome I just if I'm reacting like sana", "62:09", "makes me feel like 20% better", "62:11", "like a lot better laughter I get out now", "62:14", "if I'm not reacting I don't sweat as", "62:16", "much when I get in and it's nice but", "62:19", "it's not like a huge relief like it is", "62:21", "when I'm reacting it's giant for me I", "62:23", "mean I don't have the autoimmune issues", "62:25", "that you have but boy for me it's just", "62:27", "it's a game changer", "62:29", "yeah get in there for 20 minutes half", "62:30", "hour and I get out of there it's just", "62:32", "like everything just feels better yeah", "62:33", "yeah and it hits me like about 20", "62:36", "minutes after I get out and I get this", "62:37", "mood up it's just like ah once your body", "62:39", "I think that what that is is your", "62:41", "temperature normalizes and your body", "62:44", "temperature normalizes after you're out", "62:45", "of that heat and then everything's just", "62:47", "like oh yeah I know it's great no it's", "62:50", "great have you done cryotherapy yeah", "62:52", "similar feeling right yeah not as good I", "62:55", "don't think no but similar feeling it's", "62:58", "better actually for paint so I have my", "63:00", "ankle replacement still gives me", "63:01", "problems because it's an ankle", "63:03", "replacement so I've done cryotherapy for", "63:06", "that and that's works better for pain I", "63:08", "think than the sauna does no what do", "63:10", "they do when they replace her ankle do", "63:12", "they cut off the bottom of the joint and", "63:14", "recap it and put something else there so", "63:17", "they cut off yeah they caught off the", "63:19", "bottom of the tibia that's a big bone", "63:24", "tibia and then they replaced the top of", "63:26", "the talus it sucks and I got it done in", "63:31", "2009 when the ankle joints weren't as", "63:35", "good as they are now so now I'm left", "63:37", "with this like old ankle joint and I'm", "63:39", "26 so I have to get it looked at because", "63:44", "it's giving me problems another one oh", "63:46", "god no I hope not I think they're just", "63:48", "gonna try and fix it did some super dope", "63:50", "carbon fiber new model I know they don't", "63:53", "have that nobody's like making anything", "63:55", "cool no no it seems like them they're", "63:59", "constantly", "64:00", "proving that I mean what it looks like", "64:02", "on YouTube but that's not really what it", "64:03", "looks like in real life no no I was like", "64:06", "maybe I could just get a new foot I", "64:07", "could get a better foot right you want a", "64:09", "new foot do a new foot Wow I'm some", "64:12", "robot foot maybe I'll salon like what", "64:14", "the fuck is this depends on the robot", "64:18", "foot you'd be down for a robot foot if", "64:21", "it like took away all your pain oh my", "64:22", "god yeah if I could run again I can't", "64:24", "run with an ankle replacement what about", "64:26", "you hip replacement you can yeah but", "64:29", "they I have friends that have got a hip", "64:30", "replacement they said running is out of", "64:32", "the question", "64:32", "it's out of the idea excuse no way you", "64:35", "can't run I could run on the hip", "64:37", "replacement really", "64:38", "I can limp along with my ankle but the", "64:41", "hip replacement gives me no problems", "64:42", "it's great but I thought that the load", "64:44", "that is placed on the hip is not I don't", "64:48", "think they recommend activities like", "64:50", "that all the time all the time but even", "64:53", "like a what's an elliptical mm-hmm", "64:55", "that's pretty low impact and I can't do", "64:59", "that because of my ankle but my hip is", "65:00", "fine have you ever tried to versus a", "65:02", "climber no we have no was it sort of an", "65:06", "angled like a beam with handles on it", "65:13", "phenomenal cardio it's amazing", "65:16", "works your core because you're at an", "65:17", "angle so you got your kind of planking", "65:19", "almost a little bit while you're doing", "65:21", "it oh wow yeah I'm a tourist matter yeah", "65:24", "I do do sprints with it and then do like", "65:26", "Tabata is like 2010's Wow 20 seconds on", "65:30", "ten second break 20 seconds on 10 second", "65:32", "break", "65:32",

make you think that like if you got", "66:16", "on this diet yeah when you were younger", "66:19", "why I'm not very pleased with the", "66:21", "medical community well how did they know", "66:23", "me they didn't know back but they could", "66:25", "have said I don't know they could have", "66:26", "looked at the celiac thing and I would", "66:28", "have at least been clued in that gluten", "66:30", "was a problem and maybe just removing", "66:31", "that would have been good enough well it", "66:33", "seems that the amount of research that", "66:36", "they would have to do I mean think about", "66:37", "how many different things you had a look", "66:39", "at to come to that conclusion the time", "66:41", "you got to spend like three years and", "66:42", "yeah and Canada has public I mean you", "66:45", "have public health care right so it's", "66:48", "it's it's weird right yeah they're not", "66:51", "as motivated they're not it's not ideal", "66:54", "for people with very special problems", "66:57", "right for general public and it's great", "67:01", "if you don't have money and you need to", "67:02", "get taken care of but they have a lot of", "67:04", "people coming in and out right it's", "67:06", "constant I'm getting the surgery done in", "67:08", "North Carolina Wow just fucking turn", "67:11", "your back on Canada huh I could wait", "67:15", "around for like three and a half years", "67:17", "for a surgeon that's not as good yeah", "67:19", "yeah that um this infrared thing I'm", "67:23", "finding it very interesting stuff so I", "67:24", "remember reading what you said but I'm", "67:27", "not finding that and I've only found", "67:29", "stuff that I have found a Ben Greenfield", "67:31", "I think it was a transcription of a", "67:34", "podcast he did with Rhonda mm-hmm and", "67:35", "something else very similar there's", "67:37", "information from dr. Joel Khan mm-hmm", "67:39", "that says only sunlight sunlight and far", "67:43", "infrared saunas have been shown to", "67:44", "increase core temperature for effective", "67:47", "detoxification because they get you can", "67:49", "stay longer", "67:51", "in the threshold area they won't have", "67:54", "around 130 degrees you can be there to", "67:56", "up to 45 minutes or so hmm and you I", "67:59", "guess you can't unless you can withstand", "68:01", "it and a railer heat one because it's", "68:03", "heating the air around you're not light", "68:05", "heating your body Oh interesting yeah so", "68:08", "the infrared one is heating your body", "68:11", "and specific rather than you being in", "68:14", "the heat correct ah interesting so you", "68:17", "can do it longer and that's where the", "68:19", "benefits but how much longer how long", "68:21", "you supposed to do it for I'd said at", "68:22", "least 30 minutes but that's what I do", "68:24", "anyway", "68:25", "I don't know the difference so infrared", "68:27", "saunas good if you're a pussy so that's", "68:28", "where I didn't want to say that well if", "68:33", "it seems like you get more benefit with", "68:35", "less suffering that's what it would seem", "68:38", "like because you could do it longer I", "68:40", "think that's what they're getting at but", "68:41", "yeah I don't know if that's the reason", "68:43", "why like I don't know if people have to", "68:44", "just quit after twenty minutes and I", "68:45", "can't get to the thirty well people do", "68:47", "man the kid does get uncomfortable with", "68:49", "it but if you could have if you get the", "68:50", "same benefits and you could avoid the", "68:52", "discomfort why wouldn't you do that", "68:53", "right mm-hmm it also just it's just", "68:55", "uncomfortable right before you start", "68:57", "sweating when you're like oh I'm really", "68:58", "hot and then you start sweating and", "68:59", "you're it's not as bad there's a new", "69:01", "company that's making an infrared sauna", "69:04", "that you workout in", "69:05", "it's got a chin-up bar in and it's got", "69:08", "all these like like resistance cables", "69:11", "the other part of this too which is I'd", "69:13", "have to go more into Sciences that I", "69:15", "don't know is that the LEDs like the", "69:16", "infrared light can penetrate your skin", "69:18", "whereas the heat maybe can't because", "69:21", "it's just heat that's heating up your", "69:23", "skin it's not look like infrared is", "69:26", "literally a wave it's a light wave it's", "69:28", "a different kind of it invigorates your", "69:29", "mitochondria works and that level of", "69:32", "studies that they did in was it in", "69:34", "Norway Finland Finland yeah maybe they", "69:36", "just didn't have infrared there maybe", "69:38", "maybe I don't know because like those", "69:40", "Russian banya 's they do the regular", "69:43", "saunas these regular saunas and they go", "69:45", "hot-cold hot-cold and they've had some", "69:47", "pretty awesome benefits of that so there", "69:51", "might be something to that because", "69:52", "they're using like dentist season light",
