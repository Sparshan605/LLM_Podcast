like", "34:43", "just before you know sundown so it would", "34:46", "have been a good seven hours in the back", "34:48", "then and that's because there was no elk", "34:49", "that's going nonstop you

these animals do what they want", "36:31", "to do that's the idea they want to do in", "36:34", "BC they think that what they can do is I", "36:37", "mean this is speculation but they think", "36:39",

5060", "37:00", "years yeah and the problem is along now", "37:02", "you're gonna get a lot of human death", "37:03", "and a lot of get a lot of pets getting a", "37:05", "lot of animals are gonna invade into the", "37:07", "farmlands", "37:08", "yeah it just seems to me that that's not", "37:10", "a wise way to handle it no definitely no", "37:12", "and it's also they're gonna have to pay",

"39:31", "picked it up straight away and there was", "39:33", "no drama I was a good shot with that", "39:34", "just trying to do a rough shot thinking", "39:36", "if a bear ever gets you it's kind of in", "39:38", "a rush it's not like these you know pull", "39:41", "it pull the gun out and have a heap of", "39:42", "time so I was practicing shooting one", "39:44", "here and and everything like

"40:44", "like tried to flank me and it freaks me", "40:47", "out how fast these things can move like", "40:49", "like you seen how fast a deer can get", "40:51", "off the mark I reckon the grizzly is", "40:53", "faster than a deer and you think of the", "40:55", "size of a grizzly and it can still move", "40:57", "at the speed of a deer or faster like", "40:59", "and she just disappears into this", "41:01", "there's all this scrub beside me I can't", "41:03", "see so I'm like standing there like like", "41:05", "just waiting where's she gonna pop out", "41:07", "because I fought the third time she's", "41:08", "gonna shake fucking around she's gonna", "41:10", "try and kill me the third time right you", "41:13", "know she never showed up and I stayed", "41:15", "there for a little while I'm like just", "41:16", "start backing up and I that's where I've", "41:19", "got the camera out because the other", "41:20", "thing I'm fearful of is shooting one and", "41:23", "not being able to justify it because you", "41:25", "people go to jail get massive fine so", "41:27", "I'm like I want a document this third", "41:30", "time that she's coming I'm probably", "41:31", "gonna pull the trigger on a document", "41:33", "anyway i back out", "41:35", "she sort of stalks along a little bit", "41:37", "like watching me and stuff like that", "41:39", "then she disappears and I walk away and", "41:40", "then I realized the guns jammed the guns", "41:44", "means you're in that whole time and I", "41:47", "was like let's say shit so she did come", "41:49", "for me like truly come for me I was", "41:51", "fucked like there was no doubt that was", "41:53", "a chance what was going on those hollow", "41:54", "points with the flat face on wouldn't", "41:56", "load up into the chamber of the gun they", "41:58", "hit on the throat of the the revolver", "42:01", "and won't go up in there", "42:02", "so you'd never would have gotten off a", "42:04", "shot I would never would

original mark that she stopped at 20", "42:29", "meters I reckon I pulled the trigger and", "42:30", "it didn't go off and I kept thinking", "42:34", "like there's a slide lock on the gun and", "42:36", "I kept thinking that was jammed up and", "42:37", "it wasn't at all so those bullets just", "42:39", "didn't fit in that gonna fit in there so", "42:41", "you never practiced with him and

"of younger animals and like immature or", "56:16", "animals over that time but um I went", "56:19", "from the hot heat to got to my usual", "56:23", "spot in Montana and just whited out with", "56:25", "snow for people that are hunters it is", "56:29", "very important if you want to consider", "56:30", "the overall health of the herd you", "56:31", "always want to shoot the older mature", "56:33", "animals because they bred yeah they've", "56:36", "passed on their genetics and it also", "56:38", "improves the health of the herd because", "56:41", "then the younger males", "56:42", "that's right would probably get killed", "56:44", "yeah by the bigger males or have the", "56:46", "potential getting killed in combat when", "56:48", "they clashed and that's the whole reason", "56:49", "if people don't know why they have", "56:50", "antlers - oh yeah yeah exactly yep I", "56:53", "think my my biggest thought in that is I", "56:56", "just want to shoot an animal that's", "56:57", "lived its life you know like like look", "57:00", "if I'm desperate for me don't get me", "57:02", "wrong I'll shoot a spike or a cow", "57:04", "whatever but right but I'm not desperate", "57:07", "for meeting that point of survival you", "57:09", "know so I just feel a lot better if I", "57:11", "shoot an animal that I'm like it's lived", "57:13", "its life right you know and then the", "57:15", "byproduct of that is you get a bigger", "57:17", "animal so more meat yeah you know you", "57:20", "get a set of antlers which is to me a", "57:22", "memory it's", "57:23", "like about I don't cut the head off and", "57:25", "just walk out at the end looks like I've", "57:26", "got a trophy and I think a lot of people", "57:28", "think that for me it's why every speck", "57:30", "but it's just that's a way of respect", "57:32", "than animal today you know so it's a", "57:36", "funny thing but yeah just shooting a big", "57:37", "old you know and that's why I passed a", "57:39", "lot of lot of younger animals late", "57:41", "opportunities those one day I was right", "57:43", "on the edge of this like like it was", "57:45", "like a cliff but there was a rock that", "57:47", "went out over the cliff like a bit of a", "57:48", "pinnacle and I was actually on the", "57:50", "pinnacle and I had this ball straight", "57:52", "below me and he was like I think he was", "57:54", "he was 30-something meters but because", "57:56", "you're shooting down it's like you know", "57:58", "that the range finders saying shooted at", "58:00", "16 or 17 meters right and he was just", "58:03", "laying there had no idea I was there but", "58:07", "just a younger ball you could see it in", "58:08", "his face and his body and just these", "58:10", "antlers so but it felt good to be there", "58:13", "and then be like no and back out and", "58:15", "then it was our afternoon I think that", "58:17", "that grizzly went me so you know I had", "58:19", "opportunity to shoot

thing that people I", "58:29", "think on the outside don't understand or", "58:32", "appreciate is that it's not just about", "58:35", "getting meat it's also about getting a", "58:39", "mature animal and it's also about", "58:41", "getting a mature animal because they're", "58:42", "way more difficult exactly yeah they're", "58:44", "way smarter bein through seasons you", "58:47", "know they just heaps more switched on", "58:48", "you know there are a lot smarter so you", "58:50", "want to looks like going into a fight", "58:52", "like you don't want to go into a fight", "58:54", "or someone

time story is the kids", "77:14", "descended off the", "77:16", "from the cave and onto from the", "77:18", "escapement down under the flats and the", "77:20", "kids are told not to kill any

a gift", "78:58", "but it was all laced with poison and", "78:59", "they end up all dying in the cave so you", "79:03", "know there's two two versions of the", "79:05", "story obviously yeah it's the second one", "79:07", "yeah I don't want to say because who", "79:10", "freaking knows but well I definitely", "79:11", "know snake isn't going around lighting", "79:14", "fires yeah probably not but

"126:10", "come up when you go away for a long time", "126:12", "is you've gone and walkabout because you", "126:15", "they'd literally walk that distance", "126:16", "they'd be out on country for certain", "126:19", "them in a period and then come back so", "126:21", "that's why I've sort of adopted as well", "126:24", "like when I go walkabout mmm I got", "126:26", "walkabout on Kim a fair bit the idea of", "126:31", "driving five days that they could walk", "126:34", "it and now these are different I mean", "126:36", "we're talking about all the different", "126:37", "dialects and different tribes of people", "126:39", "know now what the hell did they do what", "126:41", "they encountered you know sometimes I'd", "126:44", "have that they'd be war and stuff like", "126:46",

"126:54", "corridor that they walk through but they", "126:57", "all had their own land what they thought", "126:59", "of pretty much caught well I can't say", "127:00", "they all had their own land because", "127:01", "there's so many indigenous mobs", "127:03", "that and there was so many differences", "127:06", "between them that some of them were just", "127:08", "pure nomadic you know and just do they", "127:10", "have written language I don't know", "127:16", "I think they've written language you can", "127:18", "don't quote me on this was like The", "127:20", "Dreamtime and the paintings and", "127:22", "everything like that and everyone tells", "127:23", "them a story what's getting lost is it's", "127:26", "only the traditional elders that know", "127:28", "those stories and they're got to pass it", "127:29", "on to the next generation so this is", "127:31", "their story this is their paintings this", "127:33", "is how the story goes when that gets", "127:35", "lost

sense it", "127:57", "shouldn't matter to anyone else because", "127:58", "it's just those people's language and", "128:00", "their story so if they die it's gone", "128:03", "with them anyway yeah but I mean it's", "128:05", "still just for the historical record I", "128:08", "think it'd be great for human just a", "128:09", "human", "128:10", "definitely yeah to understand that this", "128:12", "is a really a very little understood", "128:15", "yeah group of human beings don't you", "128:17", "hate that the mystery is getting taken", "128:18", "out of everything though like it's good", "128:22", "to have all that information like go on", "128:24", "google and find out frigging the age of", "128:27", "the the last ice age or something like", "128:29", "that and which is awesome but it also", "128:33", "cancels out all the mystery like we know", "128:35", "that there's no other sort of monster", "128:37", "crocodile in the waters anymore because", "128:39", "the whole

some", "129:04", "like real wanderlust dude you got to", "129:06", "hide in Clark type shit that's what I'm", "129:09", "like I wish I could go back in like", "129:11", "there's no way to discover

was all that mystery", "130:06", "like there was that that you", "130:07", "thinking that there was an inland ocean", "130:09", "in Australia because of these rivers", "130:10", "running now but those rivers are ancient", "130:13", "rivers they're millions of years old", "130:14", "that and for so many hundreds of", "130:17", "thousand years I haven't even ran on top", "130:18", "of the surface they run under the sand", "130:20", "in the rocks those rivers so crazy to", "130:24", "think but some of the stories is he's", "130:28", "got an awesome book well he doesn't have", "130:30", "an awesome book because he's long gone", "130:31", "but there's an awesome book out and", "130:33", "called mr.

drink as much water", "131:38", "as they can they cave it all in and the", "131:41", "water pretty much dissipates then they", "131:44", "ride out for three or four days and they", "131:47", "can't
