been just trying to make him", "13:11", "work but", "13:12", "or maybe open up possibilities excited", "13:14", "to drop for single I think you just say", "13:16", "- just keep it up right and range so", "13:18", "he's not afraid to just be right in your", "13:20", "girl's not dopey he's not riding range", "13:21", "all right but he's real relaxed like", "13:24", "even the ways throwing that jab
