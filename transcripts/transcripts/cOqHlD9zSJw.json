see in that and", "61:16", "that she when you're when you're getting", "61:19", "I mean well one article said it was like", "61:21", "150 billion dollars between the two of", "61:23", "them over like ten years or so the fact", "61:26", "that she doesn't even have a good game", "61:28", "to defend it that you can't go up", "61:32", "against Trump and say he's corrupt while", "61:35", "you're getting that much money from", "61:37", "corporate interests like she never even", "61:39", "saw how offensive it was that it's the", "61:43", "kind that Bernie Sanders doesn't do so", "61:45",

show and when they did", "65:13", "that I think he was like oh yeah well", "65:15", "I'm really gonna be fucking president", "65:16", "now and he kept going and going and", "65:18", "going and then he won I mean it seems to", "65:20", "me like the whole thing was started", "65:22", "almost as a publicity campaign like a", "65:24", "fun thing what if his people said that", "65:27", "there was a
