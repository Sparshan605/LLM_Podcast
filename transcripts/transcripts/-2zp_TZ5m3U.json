"they were different enough from coyotes", "07:22", "that they not only couldn't interbreed", "07:25", "with them anymore but they sort of are", "07:28", "mortal enemies of one another I mean", "07:31", "when we reintroduce crate wolves to", "07:32", "Yellowstone in 1995 coyotes had had 75", "07:37", "years in Yellowstone without any wolves", "07:39", "I mean that served as a wonderful", "07:42", "laboratory to study them too because it", "07:44", "gave us a sense of what happens with", "07:47", "coyotes when nobody is harassing them", "07:49", "when people are harassing them which of", "07:51", "course we didn't in Yellowstone Park and", "07:53", "when wolves aren't harassing them either", "07:55", "and what we realize is that they create", "07:58", "these really stable territories they", "08:01", "create very stable packs and their", "08:03", "population rises to a particular point", "08:05", "the carrying capacity of the landscape", "08:07", "based on what they eat which is mostly", "08:09", "rodents and rabbits and things and some", "08:12", "fruit and and berries but it doesn't", "08:16", "they don't their populations sort of", "08:19", "levels off and stays at a carrying", "08:21", "capacity and so we got to watch that", "08:24", "happen in Yellowstone for like 75 years", "08:27", "and it's become sort of the the example", "08:32", "of what would happen if we just left", "08:35", "them alone I mean some people think well", "08:37", "if we don't try to control them hell", "08:39", "they're gone", "08:39", "you know they're just going to be", "08:40", "millions upon millions of them running", "08:43", "everywhere but that's actually they only", "08:46", "do that when you try to persecute them", "08:49", "and they go into this colonization mode", "08:51", "and generate more and more and more pups", "08:53", "and have more and more pups survive so", "08:56", "Yellowstone in that period from 1925 to", "08:59", "1995 was this sort of model of what", "09:02", "happens when you just leave them the", "09:05", "hell alone and they just kind of rise to", "09:09", "a particular population level and are", "09:12", "really stable at that level and
