it", "07:06", "happens with hunters too people become", "07:10", "very tribal you know and you know it's", "07:12", "us versus them and they want to win and", "07:15", "then it becomes this thing where you", "07:17", "know look the reality is a lot of people", "07:21", "are idiots and they don't have a lot", "07:23", "going on in their life and so when", "07:25", "something comes up where it becomes a", "07:27", "primary focus of their life one", "07:29", "restaurant is illogical as it might be", "07:31", "that becomes the battleground and it's", "07:33", "an ideological battleground for you know", "07:35", "don't eat meat ever versus sustainable", "07:39", "farming you know just look I'm sure I", "07:43", "know you're a hunter I'm sure you feel a", "07:46", "certain amount of remorse when an animal", "07:48", "dies a hundred percent and you know", "07:50", "that's a big part of sort of my beliefs", "07:53", "in my philosophy and why I'm working on", "07:55", "this cookbook right now is because I", "07:57", "think that you know if you do eat meat", "07:59", "you should be able to kill an animal and", "08:01", "experience that and I think that if", "08:03", "people were to actually kill an animal", "08:05", "they would see you know what goes into", "08:08", "that and I don't think people would", "08:09", "consume as much mean and I don't think", "08:11", "people would definitely you know there's", "08:12", "certainly wouldn't waste as much meat as", "08:15", "they do and it's it's just really", "08:17", "upsetting and I think it's totally", "08:19", "misguided you know why we were targeted", "08:21", "well I mean like I said I think it just", "08:24", "becomes a game yeah it becomes a the big", "08:27", "tribal game you know there's there's a", "08:30", "real argument a real argument that I", "08:32", "support against factory farming and", "08:34", "factory farming is the way most people", "08:37", "are getting their meat in terms of like", "08:40", "in terms of like cheeseburgers and fast", "08:42", "food and stuff along those lines I mean", "08:44", "you're not getting it from the most", "08:46", "ethical sources it's just it's not", "08:48", "financially sustainable to do it that", "08:50", "way", "08:51", "everything would cost more money yeah", "08:53", "and that's a real problem that we as a", "08:56", "society it's not obviously not you were", "08:58", "either set up the system but that this", "09:01", "system is a system that we find", "09:03", "ourselves a part of mm-hmm it's a real", "09:05", "problem", "09:05", "I've removed myself from it for the most", "09:08", "part but occasionally I'm on the road", "09:10", "and I'm hungry and you know I'll eat", "09:12", "some meat that's just whatever totally", "09:14", "it's it's a necessary evil you know in", "09:17", "sort of sort of but really necessary at", "09:19", "all that maybe that's the wrong way to", "09:20", "describe it but it's how the system's", "09:22", "been set up and it's it's actually why I", "09:24", "started hunting and doing what I do", "09:26", "because I watched these documentaries", "09:28", "like Food Inc and these things that kind", "09:30", "of Shawn a light on you know the system", "09:32", "and how this stuff is actually being", "09:34", "produced and it's horrible it's it's", "09:36", "terribly is yeah and I think that's the", "09:38", "real number-one problem and you know and", "09:40", "this vegan activist message to go after", "09:43", "you know these types of farming you know", "09:46", "we support as well we agree with so the", "09:48", "fact that we were targeted for this was", "09:51", "really really frustrating yeah I think", "09:53", "vegans I understand where they're coming", "09:56", "from but I don't think that they have", "09:59", "seen the big picture and the big picture", "10:02", "is there's some animals that need to be", "10:04", "harvested they they're not sustainable", "10:06", "wild pigs is the best example yeah there", "10:09", "is no way you are going to stop wild", "10:11", "pigs without killing them there's no way", "10:13", "you're not going to give them birth", "10:15", "control you're not going to unless", "10:17", "you're gonna let loose fuckin packs of", "10:21", "wolves and I mean packs to deal with", "10:24", "like what's going on in Texas does that", "10:26", "mean they they're forced to shoot them", "10:28", "out of helicopters they're crazy they", "10:30", "hire people to come in with helicopters", "10:32", "and shoot them from the sky it's that", "10:34", "bad and
