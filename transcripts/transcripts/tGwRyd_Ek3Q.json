lot place", "01:24", "in medieval Europe I mean look at the", "01:27", "figures per hundred thousand because", "01:29", "some of them have over a hundred four", "01:31", "hundred thousand one hundred fifty five", "01:32", "hundred thousand and medieval Europe lot", "01:35", "these cities were like twenty four", "01:36", "hundred thousand so they're way worse", "01:38", "now way worse in the Wild West than like", "01:40", "now there are some place in the United", "01:42", "States the de la Owen idea I've done", "01:44", "some research recently in Baltimore", "01:45", "Maryland and I was kind of it's", "01:47", "interesting to compare that to Latin", "01:49", "America and that's high level that's", "01:52", "forty four hundred thousands that's", "01:54", "that's not as the same level but it's", "01:56", "significant still more than medieval", "01:58", "Europe yeah Wow", "02:00", "Baltimore's worse than medieval Europe", "02:01", "yeah I mean I think this you have to", "02:03", "have to some professors them they were", "02:05", "might in a like you get like no there", "02:06", "might be they might say well Jerusalem", "02:08", "in this time or in a line I like he got", "02:10", "triumph we nice hard to know it really", "02:12", "dig down exactly there", "02:13", "outbreaks of violence and killing answer", "02:16", "yes but the overall average yeah of what", "02:18", "average yeah it's a significant leap a", "02:20", "hundred percent leap yeah yeah", "02:21", "absolutely", "02:23", "Baltimore what about South Side of", "02:24", "Chicago it's not that I mean like the", "02:28", "level I think in Chicago comes out", "02:31", "around 20 or something so it's not now", "02:34", "the America of the whole city", "02:35", "now these again and one of things about", "02:37", "the violence in the United States", "02:38", "compared to Latin America when Baltimore", "02:42", "is is significant bits of fairly what", "02:45", "the city of Baltimore is a very small", "02:47", "place what they're talking about so in", "02:49", "Mexico you have entire states that are", "02:51", "like really violent or entire countries", "02:52", "in Latin America whereas in the US it", "02:55", "tends to be neighborhoods which are", "02:57", "violent so if you really focus on the", "03:00", "southside of Chicago it's probably", "03:01", "similar levels to Baltimore I think you", "03:03", "know it sir but if you look at the whole", "03:06", "city got neighbors did a pretty safe in", "03:08", "Chicago as well yeah I grew up with a", "03:10", "alcoholic father and it was a pretty", "03:13", "violent home and and he was a really bad", "03:17", "alcoholic and I know having grown up in", "03:22", "that you wind up with what I call a", "03:25", "damaged personal truth and you feel", "03:30", "second-class and the problem that kids", "03:35", "make and because I know I did it and and", "03:39", "I see others do it is you compare your", "03:42", "personal truth what you know about", "03:44", "yourself you know how you really live", "03:47", "and what's really going on you compare", "03:50", "your personal truth to everybody else's", "03:53", "social mask because you go to school and", "03:56", "you know well I know that last night", "03:59", "the windows got kicked out of my house I", "04:01", "know that the utilities got turned off", "04:04", "and I know there was a big fight in my", "04:06", "kitchen last night and the kids sitting", "04:09", "next to me he's got on a shirt that's", "04:11", "all ironed and his face is all bright", "04:13", "and clean and you know he looks like", "04:15", "he's just got it all together and you", "04:18", "compare yourself to that person that kid", "04:20", "and you feel like you're second class", "04:23", "and the problem with that", "04:25", "is we generate the results in life we", "04:28", "think we deserve so if you think you're", "04:31", "damaged do you think you're second class", "04:33", "you will generate results that you think", "04:37", "a second class person deserves hmm so if", "04:40", "you don't fix your personal truth then", "04:43", "you'll spend the rest of your life", "04:45", "saying well you know those really good", "04:46", "results those belong for somebody else", "04:49", "that's not for me that's for somebody", "04:51", "else and you'll settle for second best", "04:53", "and you won't get what you might", "04:56", "otherwise generate for yourself if you", "04:58", "don't fix your personal truth and so I", "05:01", "think a lot of people are struggling", "05:03", "looking for a way to kind of get out of", "05:05", "feeling not good about themselves and", "05:07", "damage self-esteem damage self-worth and", "05:10", "they really don't know where to go so", "05:12", "and that's why I do the show I don't", "05:15", "look I'm not under the misapprehension", "05:16", "that we're doing eight minute cures if", "05:18", "they're mean come on yeah we're not", "05:20", "doing that but I think if you can point", "05:23", "people in the right direction if you can", "05:25", "raise their awareness you can get them", "05:27", "thinking about it you can create a", "05:29", "narrative where they at least say you", "05:31", "know how do I feel about myself I mean", "05:33", "is there stuff I need to resolve I mean", "05:36", "what am I saying to myself if you can", "05:38", "get them thinking about that and you", "05:40", "know maybe you've done something yeah", "05:42", "you know Tony Robbins once said once", "05:43", "that it's incremental changes over the", "05:45", "long haul and the way you have to look", "05:47", "at it is if these two boats are going in", "05:49", "a parallel direction and one of them", "05:50", "just shifts five degrees over the course", "05:52", "of time this boat is gonna be in a far", "05:55", "different place than the other boat", "05:56", "that's going the same way it was always", "05:57", "going yeah and the important thing to", "06:00", "realize as well is the next year is", "06:03", "going to go by whether you're doing", "06:05", "something about your life or not", "06:07", "I mean we're sitting here right now at", "06:09", "the end of February and the next 10", "06:14", "months are going to go by whether", "06:17", "somebody is working to make change or", "06:19", "whether they're not and they may think", "06:21", "you know oh my god I'm so far overweight", "06:23", "I'll never get it under control or I'm", "06:25", "so behind in my bills or I'm so you know", "06:29", "just depressed or my everything is so", "06:33", "out of control well you know what you", "06:35", "make those incremental changes and then", "06:37", "you know", "06:39", "pretty soon in December you go hey I'm", "06:42", "way better off and I was at the end of", "06:44", "February so you made little changes and", "06:47", "they all added up and if you don't by", "06:50", "the end of the year you're just getting", "06:51", "deeper so every little bit matters and", "06:53", "there's a it's a seems to be like a", "06:55", "universal struggle for figuring out what", "06:58", "people are and how we should behave and", "07:00", "who gets to decide that and there's", "07:02", "certain universal truths that are", "07:04", "ignored and there's certain ones that", "07:06", "are emphasized over emphasized and", "07:07", "there's certain ones that are you know", "07:09", "that are in the Goldilocks pot and we're", "07:12", "working it out I think that's part of", "07:14", "what's going on with human beings but we", "07:16", "have to be really really careful of is", "07:18", "that by silencing some people and never", "07:22", "giving them any path to retribution we", "07:26", "create eternal enemies and this is this", "07:29", "is what easily could be happening right", "07:30", "now when someone doesn't have ability to", "07:33", "express themselves because an evil force", "07:35", "wants conflict and what you say is", "07:37", "probably know if it's an evil force but", "07:39", "it's a art title force they're there", "07:41", "listening to all those around them and", "07:43", "there's a hive hive mind sort of", "07:46", "thinking to a lot of this there's not a", "07:48", "lot of debate about some let's just say", "07:51", "this Joe and and 210th plan everybody", "07:55", "else you didn't give in to the", "07:58", "pressuring of the threat it was more", "08:01", "than nagging like a siren like a", "08:02", "bitching woman not against women so", "08:08", "that's why you didn't have me on but", "08:10", "then you realize I was just a symbol of", "08:13", "you just trying to live the life and put", "08:14", "out good ideas and talk to people but", "08:16", "folks are gonna make you choose a side", "08:18", "and that's what's happening in this", "08:20", "quickening edge I don't want you to side", "08:22", "that's why Ryan Seacrest has got it", "08:24", "nailed nobody's coming to Ryan Seacrest", "08:26", "for like political advice he's got an", "08:28", "alt he hosts a bunch of shows the real", "08:30", "nice guys got a great smile he's figured", "08:33", "it out but

seen me on everybody has but I've", "09:01", "seen way beyond guys you want to be in", "09:04", "the conflict you want to be in the fight", "09:06", "you want to take all your you're not", "09:09", "successful Joe because you played along", "09:11", "the system you're successful because you", "09:12", "did it organically and real doesn't mean", "09:14", "it's perfect doesn't mean it's bad it",

work a number of ways but", "10:11", "a mistake that a lot of young writers in", "10:14", "my department the lyrics make is that", "10:18", "they think of it as secondary hmm they", "10:21", "wait for the music or the track first", "10:23", "and then you'll walk into a studio and", "10:28", "hope that the hand of God will descend", "10:31", "and grace you with amazing epiphanies I", "10:37", "can't
