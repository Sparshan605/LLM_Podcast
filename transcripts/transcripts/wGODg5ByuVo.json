"09:23", "next round you come out and it's like", "09:24", "fresh because when he dropped him and", "09:26", "when he get when when fury got up and he", "09:28", "looked at him you know he was a little", "09:30", "bit broken he's probably like alright", "09:32", "I'm gonna take this motherfucker out", "09:33", "right and then Fury put it on him a", "09:35", "little bit", "09:35", "yeah and

question", "10:39", "I think Julio Cesar Chavez versus", "10:43", "Meldrick Taylor I a lot of people say", "10:46", "that I didn't watch that one life cuz", "10:48", "Taylor was so good yeah he was so fast", "10:51", "and he was winning up until the 12th", "10:53", "round and Chavez just kept the pressure", "10:57", "kept the pressure kept the pressure kept", "10:59", "the pressure and then eventually crack", "11:01", "crack", "11:02", "he had some of the big right hand the 12", "11:03", "run you see Meldrick is just beating", "11:05", "down the downside of that fight yeah his", "11:08",

"11:18", "after that fight so what what do you", "11:20", "think if was the Richard Steele is the", "11:22", "wrath I think it was so steel doesn't", "11:25", "start that fight in in the those last", "11:28", "seconds and Meldrick Taylor wins on the", "11:30", "cards then then what happens is their", "11:34", "rematch and does he look the same as he", "11:37", "like was he the same guy after that I", "11:39", "think if he wins the match he's done", "11:41", "he's done no matter what yeah remember", "11:43", "when Terry Norris knocked around after", "11:45", "that yeah he just did not look like he", "11:47", "could take a punch anymore that fight", "11:49", "was so brutal if you watch that fight", "11:51", "against Chavez's just constantly raking", "11:53", "his body and clip them but Meldrick was", "11:55", "just so fast and so skillful like his", "11:58", "movement his speed but Chavez was just", "12:01", "relentless it was a great fight it was a", "12:04", "great fight I watched it after the fact", "12:06", "but there's a few of those fights where", "12:08", "you know that that was the one where the", "12:11", "guy's never gonna be the same again yeah", "12:12", "you you you felt that way at watching it", "12:15", "no I felt that way afterwards okay I", "12:17", "mean watching it you go like what a", "12:19", "great fight but then afterwards you", "12:21", "realize like oh that was it that was the", "12:23", "fight I kind of felt that way honestly", "12:25", "for MMA I felt that way about Rory after", "12:28", "the Roy robbie fight right any thought", "12:30", "wonderboy mmm-hmm and I was like yeah he", "12:32", "doesn't look the same well I think he's", "12:34", "having real problems with his nose you", "12:37", "know his nose has been shattered a bunch", "12:40", "of times and he just can't take a shot", "12:41", "at it anymore it just starts bleeding", "12:43", "really bad but I think physically the", "12:46", "way he moves and his ability to take", "12:48", "punches is still exactly the same like", "12:50", "you saw him in the lima fire you know he", "12:52", "looks good still yeah he does he fucked", "12:54", "up taking that Mousasi fight though yeah", "12:56", "that sauce is too big too too big I", "12:58", "thought the same thing too you know", "13:00", "exactly I mean they have a lot of", "13:02", "similar skill sets and then the bigger", "13:05", "guy Mousasi might be a little better too", "13:08", "striking yes definitely better with a", "13:10", "striking his grounds no joke either yeah", "13:14", "musashi is just so good man he's so good", "13:16", "that like if I was in his corner ability", "13:18", "look I get that you wanted to super fine", "13:20", "I Cathy wanna do a challenge", "13:21", "this guy's quite a bit bigger than you", "13:23", "and really really fucking good", "13:25", "like Mousasi might be the best 185 er in", "13:28", "the world I think so it's not he's not", "13:30", "easy there he's with Whittaker he's with", "13:33", "ul he's there there's the mix of him I", "13:36", "really really like I have a whole lot of", "13:38", "confidence in Whittaker mmm quietly he", "13:41", "just kind of rose up to the top and I", "13:43", "think people still sleep on him I think", "13:44", "so too but I gotta say that I was", "13:47", "surprised at the decision in the Yoel", "13:50", "Romero fight the second one yeah I was", "13:52", "like I think Romero won that fight yeah", "13:54", "or if not won it was so close it had to", "13:57", "be a draw it was so fucking close but I", "13:59", "think Romero did way more damage and", "14:02", "Romero her see he heard him a couple -", "14:04", "the thing about like the wilder fight", "14:05", "like someone said to me like oh the", "14:07",

is is", "80:08", "representative of what it is you know", "80:10", "it's a league we have a regular season", "80:11", "so you fight in the regular season you", "80:13", "score a certain amount of points you", "80:15", "score points by getting finishes you", "80:17", "score points we're getting finishes in", "80:18", "the first round you know you win the", "80:20", "fight that's three points you got to", "80:21", "finish in the first that's three edition", "80:23", "points second round two points third", "80:24", "round one point and then at the end of", "80:26", "the regular season the top eight seeds", "80:28", "get into the playoffs and you fight by", "80:30", "your seed so that's why Jake had to", "80:32", "fight fight ray Cooper again mmm this", "80:34", "Jake kind of edged in to that eight spot", "80:36", "and Ray Cooper was the number one like", "80:42", "the finish in the third rounds worth", "80:44", "less than the finish in the first that", "80:46", "don't make any sense to me yeah it's um", "80:48", "because it's a little tougher to finish", "80:49", "in the third", "80:50", "yeah not only that it's a finish", "80:52", "finishes a finish yeah I I agree but I", "80:57", "don't like sometimes it takes a while to", "81:00", "finish you guys like look here's a", "81:01", "perfect example say you're fighting a", "81:04", "guy like Josh Thompson you know back in", "81:07", "the day like this is a tough fight right", "81:10", "these are two world-class fighters", "81:12", "versus you fighting Henry Smith from", "81:14", "fucking Albuquerque that nobody knows", "81:16", "right it's different if you finish that", "81:17", "guy in the first round like yeah you've", "81:18", "got to finish in the first round but did", "81:20", "you get a finish over a world-class guy", "81:22", "if you've gotta finish over a", "81:23", "world-class guy in the third that's", "81:25", "worth more", "81:26", "I mean it's depending upon who you're", "81:28", "fighting and what what style that how", "81:29", "resilient they are how difficult they", "81:31", "are to beat but then it gets becomes", "81:33", "more subjective when you're talking", "81:36", "about the difficulty and matching up", "81:38", "styles and then you're starting to bring", "81:41", "the odds into it from like like I guess", "81:44", "it wouldn't be betting odds but similar", "81:46", "to betting on yeah you know so it's one", "81:49", "of those things where there is no", "81:51", "perfect way but you take what you have", "81:54", "and do the best of what you can I get it", "81:56", "but a point the difference is in two", "81:58", "points like you get three points for the", "82:00", "first round but one point if finish the", "82:02", "third yes all that finishes a finish man", "82:06", "you told bonus points for finish as well", "82:08", "as yours is a finish I I made that", "82:10", "argument we we had that conversation is", "82:13", "it's like but then again then what do", "82:16", "you do how do you get bonus what do you", "82:17", "get bonus points for here's a perfect", "82:18", "example how dare you how dare you try to", "82:23", "diminish Yair Rodriguez last second yeah", "82:26", "hey oh of the Korean Zombie yeah no it's", "82:28", "a bull he shouldn't get all the points", "82:31", "for that yeah that was crazy", "82:33", "he literally knocked the guy with one", "82:35", "second", "82:36", "to go with a no-look elbow pack I mean", "82:40", "that's at all the points give him all", "82:42", "the points that's the JIT like yeah yeah", "82:45", "you

opinion you got Matthews who's", "104:47", "a legend and got of course George st.", "104:49", "Pierre Robbie Lawler and then Tyron who", "104:52", "knocked out Robbie Lawler I mean in my", "104:54", "opinion he's right up there and it's as", "104:56", "these wins pile up he'd make more of a", "104:59", "case of him being the best Walter Wade", "105:01", "ever", "105:01", "yeah Tyron with that being said he's", "105:05", "beaten a lot of the guys in the division", "105:07", "but he needs like you said earlier he", "105:10", "needs a fight like a GSP yeah he needs", "105:12", "some something

means", "105:46", "nothing to the to the world who Chiron", "105:49", "wants to respect what he's done as the", "105:51", "champion yeah in that case that's one of", "105:53", "the reasons why I think the fight with", "105:54", "Colby makes the most sense I think it", "105:56", "would be the most controversial", "105:57", "highest-profile cuz Kobe will talk mad", "106:00", "shit time when I get really angry and if", "106:02", "he beats him and smashes", "106:04", "then it steps up him and puts him in and", "106:07", "then in the meantime I mean till is not", "106:09", "gonna fight it 170
