think honestly cyborg has said", "04:55", "that really her best weight class isn't", "04:56", "even 45 well she's the champion of an", "04:59", "Invicta her best weight class would be", "05:01", "55 yeah I would say yeah and there's", "05:04", "other girls out there man build it and", "05:06", "they will come you know I think 55 would", "05:08", "be a really good women's class because", "05:10", "you'd almost you would almost have that", "05:13", "like Mark Hunt Brock Lesnar's style", "05:17", "you'd get some real just powerhouses in", "05:20", "there that are still not too big where", "05:23", "they're out of shape but they could just", "05:25", "I mean they could be like cyborgs I", "05:27", "think if you built it you'd have people", "05:29", "coming from other countries that you", "05:30", "probably don't even know about I think I", "05:33", "think you certainly would after a few", "05:35", "years that's just an investment that I", "05:38", "think they have to make within women's", "05:40", "MMA right now women's MMA is where men's", "05:43", "MMA was when the UFC was first purchased", "05:46", "because a lot of people don't realize", "05:47", "but when the UFC bought that when they", "05:51", "purchased it from the old owners they", "05:53", "eliminated 155 pound weight class", "05:55", "because they used to have a 155 then", "05:59", "they had a 170 and then they had I think", "06:03", "they had a middleweight and a light", "06:05", "heavyweight and a heavyweight still but", "06:07", "they didn't have anything lower than 170", "06:09", "so a lot of guys either left the UFC to", "06:12", "fight in other organizations or they", "06:14", "moved up to 170 and competed at 170 and", "06:16", "some guys were like really oversized or", "06:18", "under sized for that weight class so", "06:22", "that's not enough obviously I mean it's", "06:25", "really important that for a guy like", "06:27", "Mighty Mouse like if there wasn't a", "06:29", "hundred and 25 pound weight class which", "06:30", "where Mighty Mouse competes we wouldn't", "06:32", "be able to see the best fighter of all", "06:35", "time", "06:35", "compete in his perfect weight class or", "06:37", "one", "06:39", "five you know you wouldn't be able to", "06:40", "see Dominick Cruz compete as optimal", "06:43", "weight class 145 you wouldn't be able to", "06:45", "see Joe's a Aldo go on that reign of", "06:47", "terror for all those years you wouldn't", "06:48", "be able to see Conor McGregor fight at", "06:51", "145 and beat Aldo and then 5554 the long", "06:55", "time", "06:55", "55 which is one of the most competitive", "06:58", "and talent rich divisions in the UFC", "07:00", "didn't even exist and you know so I", "07:02", "think that the UFC if they really want", "07:06", "to make that commitment for women's MMA", "07:08", "they should have a full range of weight", "07:09", "classes for those girls to compete at I", "07:11", "think they should start maybe even lower", "07:14", "than 115 I mean you could you can make a", "07:16", "real strong argument for 105-pound", "07:18", "women's class a 1 5 or 115 or 125 and", "07:21", "then I think really the trend of those", "07:24", "10 pound per weight class that should", "07:26", "exist the men's division as well there's", "07:28", "two big the bet that gaps in the men's", "07:31", "divisions are way too big", "07:32", "there's 170 and then there's 15 counts", "07:35", "higher 185 that's a big jump and then", "07:37", "there's 20 pounds above that 85 to 205", "07:40", "20 pounds think about taking 20 16 ounce", "07:45", "t-bone steaks and that's how much bigger", "07:48", "that guy is than the air above form then", "07:51", "you go 205 to 265 so think about taking", "07:56", "60 t-bone steaks yeah 6-0 it's stacking", "08:00", "them up thinking about all the", "08:01", "horsepower that comes with all that", "08:03", "weight it's just there's to the the gaps", "08:07", "are too large you know if there's too", "08:09", "few weight classes so I think the UFC", "08:12", "would be it would be very smart for them", "08:15", "to make more weight classes do a weight", "08:18", "class every ten pounds and eliminate the", "08:20", "weight cutting if they could and I think", "08:22", "you can be done there they're probably", "08:24", "gonna have to get rid of some champions", "08:26", "though not get rid of but they're gonna", "08:29", "have to read gonna have to move with", "08:31", "your allies around yeah I mean and the", "08:33", "people boards and bills yeah they're not", "08:35", "gonna want to do that you know you're", "08:36", "not gonna be able to it's gonna be a", "08:38", "hard fight to tell a guy like Dominick", "08:39", "Cruz you can't cut weight you know when", "08:41", "he's the world champion he's hit look", "08:43", "man what do you weigh you weigh 155", "08:45", "you're gonna have to fight it 155 yeah", "08:56", "you", "English (auto-generated)"]
