in", "09:36", "2006 there was a kid in Arizona who", "09:40", "realized that he could start stimulating", "09:43", "his nerves with magnets with magnetic", "09:46", "implants he went to a body mod guy and", "09:49", "got an implant done in his fingers it", "09:53", "started going from him to a guy in", "09:54", "Europe and then like 2008 there was a", "09:58", "lady Quinn Norton who wrote for

and what what", "10:35", "benefit is there of having magnets in", "10:37", "your fingers like what what did it", "10:39", "accomplish Framm um besides making it", "10:41", "easier to put your hand on a", "10:43", "refrigerator easier I think it's", "10:46", "annoying but it would be an annoying", "10:48", "moment but you're always getting stuck", "10:50", "to things yeah doesn't it doesn't", "10:52", "exactly work like that these are really", "10:53", "tiny magnets so I got magnets and your", "10:55", "fingers yeah yeah I got like got one", "10:59", "around there one around there Wow so so", "11:05", "you implanted magnets in your fingers", "11:07", "yeah why did you do that", "11:09", "I was drunk no kidding I'm kidding", "11:12", "um I found out about this I was really", "11:15", "interested in everything we've been", "11:17", "talking about I ran into a childhood", "11:20", "friend of mine who got it done", "11:22", "last year and when he showed me what he", "11:24", "was doing with it I had to do it what", "11:27", "was he doing with it um it gives you the", "11:30", "ability when you implant the magnet in a", "11:32", "nerve dense area of your hand when you", "11:35", "were around an electromagnetic field", "11:36", "that magnet vibrates and so you can feel", "11:40", "that", "11:40", "now there's property of our brains", "11:43", "called neuroplasticity when you provide", "11:46", "a stimulus over a course of time like", "11:50", "about 6 months your brain starts", "11:53", "adapting to it it starts building", "11:54", "something new and I was always", "11:57", "fascinated even as a child of the idea", "12:01", "of having an extra sense not necessarily", "12:04", "like ESP but just an extra sense or be", "12:07", "able to hear a sound that

what extra scents", "12:28", "the extra sense of using these magnets", "12:30", "to detect an electrical field or to", "12:32", "vibrate during electrical fields that we", "12:34", "were saying yeah yeah how you define an", "12:36", "electrical field um it's our station", "12:39", "it's an electromagnetic field so anytime", "12:41", "that an electron travels in a straight", "12:44", "line you have a magnetic field that's", "12:48", "coming out kind of in a circle around it", "12:50", "okay", "12:50", "radiates around it right um if you have", "12:52", "a coil a coil of wire and the electrons", "12:55", "going through a coil", "12:56", "there'll be kind of like a doughnut", "12:58", "shaped magnetic field around it so those", "13:01", "sort of fields that property of volume", "13:05", "and property of frequency they vibrate", "13:08", "at a certain certain frequency and", "13:11", "they're loud or soft like a transformer", "13:14", "like will actual transfer oh yeah", "13:15", "building that high absolutely so if you", "13:18", "were near that with your fingers having", "13:19", "the magnets in them what would happen -", "13:21", "um I can feel those sometimes when", "13:25", "people would ask me at the beginning", "13:27", "what it was like to feel this stuff I", "13:29", "would describe it like an effort of", "13:31", "effervescent feeling like bubbles it", "13:34", "felt like bubbles and it was really", "13:37", "interesting - it felt like bubbles yeah", "13:39", "like how does that work um what's the", "13:42", "weirdest explanation for some of that or", "13:44", "description I feel like bubbles yeah I", "13:46", "don't even know what you mean it felt", "13:47", "like fizz yeah kind of like fizz like my", "13:50", "pop-tarts like pop rocks rather sea foam", "13:53", "I think is what any phone I don't know", "13:55", "um froth like dog frog every person that", "13:58", "has the implant uses completely", "14:00", "different language yeah it's been really", "14:02", "fascinating to run into other people", "14:04", "with implants and talk about this stuff", "14:06", "because we are describing the same", "14:08", "phenomena and it's like you're asking me", "14:11", "to describe a color that you've never", "14:13", "seen before how am I going to describe", "14:15", "squat its squat was that blue no its", "14:18", "squat is it purple no it's like tasting", "14:21", "an orange oh so it's orange no is is", "14:24", "there any negative repercussions to", "14:26", "having these magnets installed in your", "14:27", "body um well the first time", "14:30", "someone actually said something that", "14:31", "made sense as far as a negative thing I", "14:33", "saw a speech by coin Norton where she", "14:36", "said hey don't do this this is a bad", "14:38", "idea", "14:39", "hers shattered which had her magnetic", "14:43", "implant shattered shattered okay so when", "14:46", "a magnet receives either a lot of heat", "14:48", "or a very

doctor and the doctor was", "15:27", "like well here's the thing", "15:28", "we could go through all the trouble of", "15:30", "pulling it out but so tiny and it's so", "15:34", "little that's really not going to bother", "15:36", "you and so they left it in and over the", "15:39", "course of time that magnet pulled itself", "15:42", "back together she never got the sense", "15:44", "back but it pulled itself back together", "15:46", "yeah and it didn't Harbor a creepy", "15:50", "little creature if you guys are", "15:51", "interested moving around inside of her", "15:53", "fan she break it

are under", "17:06", "you these are under your fingers no", "17:08", "that's that's a lot larger but if you", "17:10", "guys are curious about magnet yeah yeah", "17:13", "there you go so I need

to it's a research facility", "24:02", "it's not a Dahmer's joke okay what you", "24:05", "said someone's died from an MRI what is", "24:07", "that well I was trying to say is if you", "24:09", "have metal in the room when they turn", "24:11", "the MRI on a child died recently", "24:13", "accidentally because they had an oxygen", "24:15", "tank in the room and they weren't aware", "24:17", "they

killed them by the time they", "24:29", "could shut it off he's already dead I", "24:30", "mean it's insane amount of pressure", "24:31", "you're dealing with and it's just", "24:33", "because

yeah stop that what you're a", "25:02", "suit or something like that yeah huh", "25:05", "that's interesting but you're not doing", "25:06", "that with your fingers you just let him", "25:07", "tingle

I think if we've even even if", "25:18", "you're not I'm not advocating that", "25:20", "someone with this in their finger go in", "25:22", "and test it but you know even if you can", "25:25",

happens now you have this which", "25:39", "you've already done with the the magnets", "25:41", "what is what's the next level thing", "25:43", "obviously everything progresses so what", "25:45", "it would people considering doing now so", "25:48", "we're doing well a lot of people are", "25:51", "building devices that interact with the", "25:53", "magnets so you can think of it as", "25:55", "because it interacts with electricity", "25:58", "and magnetism it's kind of like a really", "26:00", "low level input you can input anything", "26:02", "so if you've got an external device", "26:04", "that's measuring say the amount of co2", "26:08", "in the room you could hook that up", "26:10", "through a coil around your finger around", "26:13", "your magnet finger and have that",

"26:27", "data you want and have it transfer that", "26:30", "to the magnet and after after some", "26:33", "training it becomes intuitive so you", "26:38", "know some people have done it with", "26:39", "mainly sonar and thermal like a like a", "26:42", "thermal laser now I know the people have", "26:45", "talked about the ultimate the the", "26:50", "ultimate future of incorporating", "26:52", "technology and human body is the ability", "26:55", "to take the mind and download its", "26:57", "consciousness somewhere into an", "26:59", "artificial creation but somewhere along", "27:02", "one is probably to be some steps right", "27:04", "just and you guys are kind of taking", "27:07", "like one of these steps like by putting", "27:10", "magnets in your body when do you think", "27:12", "you're going to see someone who puts a", "27:14", "cell phone in their body it's not coming", "27:15", "is it going to be like a neural", "27:17", "interface that allows you to get online", "27:19", "with Wi-Fi well we're somewhere towards", "27:23", "that that's something else we're working", "27:25", "on so our CTO is dream the thing that", "27:30", "brought us all together wasn't magnets", "27:33", "that was that was ancillary he was love", "27:36", "right yeah well of course it was love", "27:38", "because we all kind of knew each other", "27:41", "we all have this love of the future and", "27:43", "we all", "27:43", "kind of we're told to sit back and let", "27:46", "Motorola take care of it and none of us", "27:49", "wanted to deal with that but he wanted", "27:53", "to build something that he believed that", "27:56", "we have the ability to do this stuff", "27:58", "ourselves we don't have to wait for some", "28:00", "big company to do it we can do it cheap", "28:02", "we can do it ourselves design it", "28:04", "ourselves and since we know people who", "28:07", "can install magnets under our skin why", "28:09", "not an implant why not well the goal was", "28:13", "to have something so basically what it", "28:16", "does is it's a it's a rose compass that", "28:20", "electrically stimulates you it's", "28:22", "probably here on your calf and it's", "28:25", "always pointing north", "28:26", "so that you always have an intuitive", "28:28", "sense of where North is now if you've", "28:30", "got if you've got the chip talking to", "28:33", "some external thing you could hook it up", "28:35", "to a map system like Google Maps and be", "28:37", "like yo take me home and then you have", "28:40", "an intuitive sense of where home is", "28:42", "always what's ads wait a minute but hold", "28:46", "on wait back that up you have a compass", "28:50", "installed in your body and the body how", "28:53", "does it run it just runs on the", "28:55", "magnetism that's in the compass it's all", "28:57", "mechanical is that what Sonic's involved", "28:59", "right it can be powered wirelessly so", "29:00", "it's got like a wireless coil on it so", "29:02", "it's powered yeah an external yeah okay", "29:05", "and so you can like hover it over that's", "29:07", "that's what the the dream is and what is", "29:10", "the method of communication to the mind", "29:12", "that explains where North is or how to", "29:15", "give so it's in the same way that you're", "29:18", "using a really simple system in terms of", "29:20", "the magnet you're not using any magic", "29:21", "it's just vibrating for this", "29:23", "it's just applying a very very small", "29:25", "amount of electricity enough that you", "29:28", "can there's there's a sensation so it's", "29:30", "not like blaring and it's not shocking", "29:32", "you but there is a sensation is this", "29:34", "completely theoretical the idea of being", "29:36", "able to find your way home or is really", "29:38", "we we have parts of it parts of it built", "29:42", "and actually when we came together and", "29:44", "we had that idea we said okay this thing", "29:46", "has way too many features so what we're", "29:48", "going to do is we're going to build", "29:49", "we're going to build an implant that's a", "29:51", "kind of a halfway step to there so that", "29:54", "we build the ground towards it and", "29:56", "that's actually", "29:59", "it's actually this thing here and so", "30:02", "what this thing does is it actually it's", "30:05", "a quantified self health metric and this", "30:09", "is a this is just going to take data you", "30:12", "can check this out this uh takes medical", "30:16", "data and sends it to your phone uh so if", "30:21", "you can imagine having maybe six months", "30:23", "worth of your medical data and it's your", "30:27", "data it's not anyone else's data your", "30:29", "data and you can do whatever with it and", "30:33", "so we wanted to kind of make do a half", "30:37", "way project so that we get familiar with", "30:39", "implant technology and then move towards", "30:42", "really cool shit", "30:43", "the iid I understand the idea of a", "30:48", "compass I understand that you could", "30:50", "power it somehow but what I don't", "30:52", "understand is how the compass is", "30:54", "communicating with your mind so it in", "30:56", "the in the same way that the nervous", "30:59", "system is is communicating with your", "31:03", "mind it's not uh it's not sending it", "31:06", "wirelessly to your brain right there", "31:08", "there are things in your body that's", "31:10", "communicating to your nervous system", "31:12", "that then goes to your mind right so", "31:13", "you're literally uh you're literally", "31:16", "making a new mini organ that or another", "31:20", "part of your body that interfaces with", "31:23", "your nervous system through electricity", "31:24", "and then you're just saying it's like a", "31:27", "vibration or something it's like a", "31:28", "low-level pulse or something yeah it's a", "31:30", "low-level pulse yeah I understand that I", "31:32", "understand that you would get a", "31:34", "sensation but I don't understand how it", "31:36", "could be directional I don't see the", "31:37", "Meccan well well it's it's a it's a rose", "31:39", "compass right so what does a rose", "31:41", "compass mean it's uh so it's got a clock", "31:44", "yeah it's got north south east west and", "31:47", "then like north west", "31:48", "oh that's called a rose company yeah", "31:50", "okay so it's a compass yeah and yes it's", "31:53", "it's a compass okay and so let's say", "31:55", "let's say I'm facing north uh-huh the", "31:58", "stimulation will be going this way right", "32:00", "but if I if I turn it's going to start", "32:05", "so start stimulating its directional", "32:08", "interact at wherever the north is it", "32:10", "gives a signal", "32:11", "morning where the arrow goes yeah so the", "32:13", "arrow it not just doesn't just act as a", "32:15", "beacon it's somehow or another like", "32:17", "sends a charge off in that direction", "32:19", "yeah and then it becomes intuitive once", "32:22", "you start determining what that signal", "32:24", "means like it becomes a new thing sort", "32:27", "of like sound like you hear sound over", "32:29", "here and you know it's coming in that", "32:30", "direction", "32:31", "yeah so that's crazy it's intuitive in", "32:33", "the sense that like I would be working", "32:34", "with with some of the guys in a lab and", "32:37", "you know they've got two or three", "32:39", "implants and they would say leave the", "32:42", "soldering iron on and they'd go to reach", "32:44", "to grab something and just them feeling", "32:47", "this the the intensity of the soldering", "32:49", "iron would make them pull back right and", "32:51", "so it's not like they're like oh shit", "32:53", "that that might kill me let me pull back", "32:55", "it's more like it's more like every time", "32:58", "you reach over here something screams at", "33:00", "you or or something like pokes you it's", "33:02", "like people who are allergic to cats if", "33:04", "you're around the cat", "33:07", "you know like you that's a kind of", "33:09", "superpower a person who's allergic to", "33:11", "cats can walk into a house and be like", "33:13", "you have cats right", "33:15", "you have cats they can sense the cat", "33:17", "because they start using excessive", "33:19", "you're dirtying you know clean your eyes", "33:21", "yeah well generally people have cats", "33:22", "tell the rows little creatures pretty", "33:25", "filthy when you walk into a house and", "33:26", "you get that first woof to the cat", "33:28", "litter box mixing it with old bananas so", "33:31", "nice you have a box of shit in your", "33:33", "house yeah nice dirty box of shit and a", "33:36", "filthy which animal want peering out at", "33:38", "you from the wall ready to smother your", "33:40", "baby won't sleep and suck the breath", "33:42", "right out are you so gonna do strike ass", "33:44", "that's awesome um I think this people", "33:48", "like you make me love existing today", "33:52", "because the idea that there are human", "33:54", "beings at this very moment and I picture", "33:56", "you in a basement in in basements with", "33:59", "straight razors shaking cutting", "34:02", "themselves open and just putting chips", "34:05", "inside of their mouths they doctors", "34:07", "novelists done man oh fantasy leather", "34:13", "strap bite down a twig", "34:16", "now guys are both right you're both kind", "34:19", "of right see ya you don't all go to a", "34:21", "doc what doctor do you go to what doctor", "34:23", "do you guys go to", "34:24", "I thought your evil dr. evil and I", "34:28", "imagine that when before you guys put", "34:30", "the magnets and you're snorting oxy", "34:32", "cotton or like you're definitely on", "34:35", "painkillers right do you land on I got", "34:38", "it done with no pain meds and oh my gosh", "34:41", "um it was a rush I never had that much", "34:45", "bad to do hon dude stand there with a", "34:48", "razor blade in the photo says I got a", "34:50", "ton without painkillers and oh my gosh", "34:51", "what a rush", "34:53", "I I don't it was he was it was something", "34:56", "else the amount of endorphins you got", "34:57", "it's it's trauma", "34:59", "it's trauma your body is going through", "35:00", "trauma and your body releases all that", "35:03", "endorphins all at once you you", "35:06", "definitely you don't remember the fact", "35:08", "that you just got going to shock", "35:10", "I don't wear I don't advocate people", "35:12", "doing this uh to I know so I don't", "35:14", "advocate in the book opening themselves", "35:16", "up at all uh that's not going to stop", "35:19", "anybody it's too late right now there's", "35:21", "already 700 teens with exacto knives", "35:25", "putting their dad's wristwatch bandana", "35:27", "in mouth well but eat kids if you're", "35:32", "watching slot eriously don't kill it", "35:34", "never ends well someone already tried it", "35:37", "and they're kind of fucked up because of", "35:39", "it who tried what um so one of the", "35:42", "people that pioneered this this this uh", "35:45", "lady out in Scotland called LEP's and in", "35:48", "him she did this talk called cybernetics", "35:51", "for the masses um where she advocating", "35:55", "you know implants and she did it herself", "35:59", "she she sterilized uh what is she she", "36:04", "used used vodka she's vodka and hot glue", "36:07", "to coat the magnets she uh in her speech", "36:10", "she told everyone hey I don't care how", "36:13", "hard core you think you are get a", "36:15", "spotter yeah and as you know pass out", "36:17", "and that that to me that to me also used", "36:20", "a vegetable peeler ya know that to me", "36:23", "that to me is not is not DIY cybernetics", "36:27", "that's irresponsible", "36:28", "that's a nice ability I'm gonna tell you", "36:30", "that when you told me your name", "36:32", "that's like don't leave at home with", "36:33", "your keys I've seen that speech weapon", "36:36", "and I'm yeah and I emailed her directly", "36:38", "after the speech because I wanted to get", "36:40", "her on my podcast but she first ought to", "36:42", "know she was a she cuz she's androgynous", "36:44", "you can't really tell but she looks like", "36:45", "she fell out of a philip k dick novel", "36:48", "like she is you a really fascinating", "36:51", "being like it's a really curious being", "36:53", "and she seems

look at the own users", "47:39", "don't get to dictate the political", "47:40", "landscape that's the one it's also", "47:42", "producers yeah but it's not cell phone", "47:44", "producers you're

idea", "80:56", "but I've never seen anything compelling", "80:59", "compelling so I can't I can't really say", "81:02", "it's a mindfuck out and then the idea of", "81:05", "like a little you a little Lucas running", "81:08", "around made out of rubber and it's you", "81:11", "your consciousness is in this thing it's", "81:14", "out there touching things and moving", "81:15", "stuff around yeah and also that you", "81:18", "could duplicate a Lucas like if you", "81:19", "could download a Lucas then your Lucas", "81:21", "getting up on the on Pirate Bay people", "81:24", "could just be downloading you and then", "81:26", "sending you pictures of their Lucas that", "81:28", "they've put in some kind of Habitrail", "81:30", "but that would definitely be another", "81:31", "that would

that's gonna be really weird", "81:42", "and you know unless they all interface", "81:44", "somehow or another together which she is", "81:46", "yeah which which I mean as possible", "81:49", "right I mean if you're dealing with look", "81:51", "the idea of sending someone a video or", "81:54", "talking to someone through FaceTime or", "81:55", "Skype in real time off your phone seems", "81:58",

"82:04", "but it's real the idea that you and your", "82:07", "three clones or whatever they are could", "82:10", "be experiencing life simultaneously and", "82:13", "that you could multitask and that the", "82:15", "mind may evolve to concentrate on one", "82:17", "person or the other these two sleep are", "82:18", "these two are out you know and you're", "82:20", "doing two different things at

your", "82:28", "right hand it's going to be a problem", "82:30", "man you're going to have swarms of", "82:31", "individuals there's going to be Rogen", "82:34", "swarms like like Genghis Khan like you", "82:37", "know ginga's Khan's responsible for like", "82:38", "something like 5% of the population is", "82:40", "DNA because they just you know he went", "82:42", "on a party in spring the 1200s and", "82:45", "the whole world's never recovered you", "82:47", "know imagine if you doing that", "82:48", "artificially well when you about stuff", "82:50", "that's that powerful all of a sudden it", "82:53", "becomes really important who has control", "82:55", "of that technology in the initial", "82:57", "frappin how do you enforce that how yeah", "82:59", "it's a race it's a race hold on what", "83:02", "what about he wants to create right he", "83:09", "wants to create an army well not an army", "83:12", "army but a whole group of people he does", "83:16", "um did you pay attention to the global", "83:20", "future 2045 conference yeah I know about", "83:23", "the 2045 guys what do you guys think", "83:25", "about that um I like that uh that", "83:30", "they're working towards a solid project", "83:33", "because that's kind of rare in the", "83:35", "transhumanist community there's just a", "83:36", "lot of sci-fi talk really and way too", "83:41", "much just way too much that's fine", "83:43", "that's just discontent and the", "83:44", "transhumanist community they're debating", "83:46", "on how to handle this correctly he's", "83:48", "gotta know what the fuck he's doing with", "83:49", "robots but uh I like I like the fact", "83:52", "that they have a goal that they're", "83:54", "working towards I just I feared that uh", "83:58", "there will be a particular group of", "84:00", "people that'll that'll get it and then", "84:02", "just fuck us for eternity that's your", "84:05", "big fear your big fear is someone else", "84:07", "getting a hold of the goods first and", "84:09", "not on you I the superchip I fear about", "84:12", "the type of people that'll that'll get", "84:14", "it first because the the world didn't", "84:17", "fare well when a particular people said", "84:19", "if people got the gun first that wasn't", "84:22", "good for a lot of the human species oh", "84:24", "it was good for us though that's how", "84:27", "you're here dude that's how you're", "84:28", "sitting on the internet with a plastic", "84:30", "microphone in front of you sucked out of", "84:32", "the earth I would verted from oil", "84:34", "I would rather I would rather not have", "84:35", "to move forward with that sort of", "84:37", "contention and fighting and just pee I", "84:41", "don't I don't think is that inevitable I", "84:42", "mean it with enlightenment I mean we", "84:44", "have it whether or not we've achieved", "84:47", "enlightenment we certainly haven't but", "84:48", "at the highest levels of humanity I", "84:50", "think people are probably more aware and", "84:52", "tuned in today than at any other time in", "84:54", "history and it's probably way safer", "84:57", "today than any other time yes", "84:58", "even though there's a lot of crazy shit", "85:00", "that goes down on a regular basis if you", "85:02", "compared your everyday life to that of", "85:03", "someone living in Siberia and the twelve", "85:06", "hundreds and the Mongols came storming", "85:07", "in yeah we live a lot better yeah it's a", "85:10", "pretty pretty goddamn good eye and I", "85:12", "think that a big part of that is", "85:14", "technology and the access to information", "85:16", "the access to information is freer than", "85:18", "ever before technology more powerful", "85:20", "than ever before hence people are

be", "85:31", "enforced in order to keep the peace but", "85:33", "that's something that's beneficial and", "85:35", "something that you would should strive", "85:37", "for it's admirable I think that that", "85:39", "really might not have existed on such a", "85:41", "mass scale in the past even in the past", "85:43", "20 or 30 years I think we're dealing", "85:45", "with like pretty unprecedented times and", "85:47", "it sounds like really super you know", "85:50", "optimistic but I feel like with one of", "85:53", "the byproducts of this technology that", "85:55", "we're all experiencing is that we're", "85:57", "experiencing a sort of mini", "85:58", "enlightenment and on a burst of", "86:00", "enlightenment because of this", "86:02", "information if that is the case I think", "86:04", "that this kind of technology that it", "86:07", "sort of dissolves more boundary I don't", "86:09", "think it's going to lead to a", "86:11", "constriction of the people that utilize", "86:14", "it I think it's going to lead to a", "86:15", "freedom of the species itself I really", "86:18", "do believe that I think that if I look", "86:21", "at the trend even though everybody wants", "86:24", "to think the sky is falling the trend", "86:25", "doesn't indicate that that the sky is", "86:27", "falling for some people in some spots", "86:29", "and the apocalypse is right now if you", "86:31",

yeah", "87:00", "wait until one of these one of these", "87:02", "people invent a swarm of nanobots that", "87:04", "goes flying out their basement devouring", "87:06", "toddlers I mean the thing is

about this kind of stuff you're", "87:19", "you're talking about acceleration I", "87:21", "think you're talking about a", "87:22", "technological acceleration and wherever", "87:24", "there's
