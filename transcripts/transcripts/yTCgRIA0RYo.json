fighting for", "04:47", "the UFC fighters even though she's not", "04:49", "an EEOC does that what it's I haven't", "04:52", "looked into that like I haven't looked", "04:54", "at like what are they what do they want", "04:56", "what are they trying to accomplish", "04:58", "what's not correct that they want to fix", "05:00", "I think just any any grievances that the", "05:05", "fighters have in general so like health", "05:08", "care salary just things that everyone", "05:14", "kind of agrees on is like not good", "05:17", "enough yet in the UFC I think those are", "05:20", "the things that they're working towards", "05:21", "how does health care work are you guys", "05:23", "covered in training or you only covered", "05:25", "for fights as far as I know if you book", "05:30", "a fight and you get injured", "05:32", "I think they cover it but I think it's", "05:34", "also a gray area where like they could", "05:36", "not cover it and they're not legally", "05:39", "obligated to fix you but I think in the", "05:44", "past they have I'm not sure I can't", "05:46", "think of any any examples where they", "05:49", "haven't like you know taking care of the", "05:52", "medical expenses of someone who got hurt", "05:55", "but I know like a lot of times fighters", "05:58", "don't claim it in time like after fights", "06:00", "or it's like a little nagging injury", "06:03", "that becomes a big deal further down the", "06:05", "line and it happened in the fight but", "06:08", "they waited too long yeah yeah either", "06:10", "that or just you know just wear and tear", "06:13", "from training in general like you can't", "06:15", "I can't go in for like a loose tooth or", "06:18", "like or like a shoulder that I taught in", "06:21", "practice if I wasn't getting ready for a", "06:23", "fight what seems so crazy because you're", "06:25", "obviously fighting in the UFC of a", "06:27", "long-term contract yeah you've been", "06:29", "fighting in the UFC for years if you're", "06:31", "training you're training to fight in the", "06:32", "UFC yeah", "06:33", "and I think I think a lot of instances", "06:38", "they still take care of the fighter but", "06:40", "I know like if you're like on the lower", "06:42", "end if you haven't really made a name", "06:44", "for yourself yet sometimes you know even", "06:48", "if you just don't ask like you don't get", "06:50", "taken care of it's not like it's not in", "06:52", "your contract once you sign like oh I'm", "06:55", "gonna fight this many fights but there's", "06:58", "nothing in there that says if I get", "07:00", "injured after signing this contract I'm", "07:03", "covered medically so um so yeah I think", "07:06", "that was that was the main reason I was", "07:09", "like oh this is a good idea just because", "07:12", "like I know so many fighters who booked", "07:15", "fights just to get their injuries taken", "07:17", "care of mmm you know or they though", "07:20", "fight injured and claim an old injury", "07:22", "and like and that's their way of fixing", "07:26", "whatever they broke during trainings", "07:28", "that sucks it's horrible it's such a", "07:31", "fucking crazy way to make a living", "07:34", "period yeah you know it's like you're", "07:36", "you're deciding you're gonna throw your", "07:38", "bones at someone and try to break their", "07:40", "arms you try to rip their legs apart and", "07:42", "this and then you're gonna practice that", "07:45", "all the time and then you're gonna hope", "07:46", "you don't get hurt in practice to the", "07:48", "point where you can't actually just go", "07:49", "do it", "07:49", "inside the Octagon yeah yeah exactly and", "07:52", "most of my injuries happen outside a", "07:54", "camp because I'm either training stupid", "07:57", "training with someone I who I shouldn't", "07:59", "be training was like someone too big or", "08:00", "too inexperienced or or I'm just like", "08:05", "fucking around like when I'm fighting", "08:06", "someone who's my size is a lot less", "08:09", "likely that I get injured right but when", "08:11", "I'm throwing my bones like I said at", "08:13", "somebody who's way bigger than it's easy", "08:15", "I can hurt my hand punching them you", "08:18", "know break my break my like or break my", "08:20", "toe like kicking them you know that's", "08:22", "for someone like you who fights at 115", "08:25", "pounds it's even more difficult right", "08:27", "because the lack of people that are your", "08:30", "size to train with in you're also", "08:31", "trained a lot with men and it's and", "08:34", "create it's crazy because at a", "08:36", "professional level like you're you're", "08:38", "right there you know you just beat the", "08:40", "shit out of Hannah cyphers it was a", "08:41", "crazy fight thank you", "08:43", "but that was a big fight for you yeah", "08:46", "like you're you're in the heat right now", "08:48", "yeah means you're right there so for you", "08:51", "you're you're you know you're at the top", "08:53", "of the heap in this championship realm", "08:57", "right and to train with people that are", "09:00", "bigger than you or to take chances like", "09:02", "that like there's no other sport that", "09:04", "would have that yeah you know yeah and", "09:06", "it's like the lack of women as well you", "09:10", "know because even if I'm training with", "09:12", "like a bantamweight if it's a woman like", "09:14", "it's not as dangerous as training with", "09:18", "like some of the bigger guys like the", "09:20", "like guys and girls are kind of like", "09:22", "different sizes like if I'm if I'm", "09:24", "training with a guy who fights at 1:15", "09:26", "he's gonna be like four foot tall you", "09:29", "know so it's a it's like the weight", "09:32", "distribution is different but like I", "09:35", "don't know something about I guess", "09:37", "training with women like the strength", "09:39", "the the force that's coming at you", "09:41", "versus the force you're giving to them", "09:43", "though I just feel like it's a lot safer", "09:45", "to train with love it oh for sure for", "09:47", "sure but some people think that the", "09:49", "opposite is that if you train with men", "09:51", "like say if you were trained with a", "09:53", "bunch of bantamweight men yeah they", "09:54", "would be bigger than you yeah they'd be", "09:55", "stronger than you but you get used to", "09:56", "that then you'd be used to men and then", "09:58", "when you fight with women they would", "10:00", "seem smaller and weaker yeah that's that", "10:02", "was my old like theory so when I was at", "10:06", "like My Little Gym in New York I was", "10:10", "only training with guys like the girls I", "10:12", "would come in they weren't at my level", "10:14", "and that's the same story that most", "10:17", "girls in the UFC have you know they were", "10:19", "at the top of their heap they were like", "10:21", "the baddest girl in the gym you know", "10:23", "beaten up all the other girls and hang", "10:24", "with the guys and that was me so it", "10:27", "wasn't until I got on top that I", "10:32", "realized like everyone has the same", "10:34", "exact background so everyone's tough", "10:36", "because they were training with guys and", "10:39", "you start to underestimate like how", "10:41", "tough a girl's gonna be in there like", "10:44", "when you're fighting like tooth and nail", "10:46", "like you know to the death is basically", "10:48", "like what you're doing in the cage until", "10:50", "the ref pulls you off you know and then", "10:52", "it's all hugs but like when you're given", "10:55", "like a hundred percent the key", "10:56", "it feels like just as strong as a guy", "10:58", "you know so it's good to like still have", "11:02", "those checks and balances like okay like", "11:04", "yeah maybe she's not as strong as the", "11:07", "guys I trained with but she is going as", "11:09", "hard as she can or she's defending it as", "11:12", "hard as she can or you know she's taking", "11:14", "my punches that I thought like oh if I", "11:16", "drop this guy with this punch then this", "11:18", "girl's gonna get dropped too and it's", "11:20", "not the case like she's just a tougher", "11:22", "tougher so it's it's like a weird thing", "11:24", "where like you have like I don't know of", "11:27", "you have different stats like stacked in", "11:30", "some areas that guys don't and then they", "11:34", "have stats stacked in areas that women", "11:36", "don't so it's like it's like if I was", "11:39", "it's like if I was like a bantamweight", "11:42", "guy who only trained with like light", "11:45", "heavyweights you know like you're gonna", "11:47", "be faster you're gonna have like you're", "11:50", "probably gonna be more technical just", "11:51", "because you have to train with people", "11:53", "that big so if you fuck up a technique", "11:55", "it's not gonna work", "11:56", "but those guys are still gonna be bigger", "11:58", "and stronger and be able to like muscle", "12:00", "you hold you down that kind of thing so", "12:02", "I feel like that's like a similar", "12:04", "difference particularly striking right", "12:06", "like with with grappling there's some", "12:08", "really little guys that are impossible", "12:10", "to tap they just develop really crazy", "12:12", "technique yeah but what's striking", "12:14", "there's only so much you could do you", "12:17", "know if you're a lightweight guy you're", "12:18", "not sparring with Francis and Gahan Oh", "12:19", "er he better be really really really", "12:21", "nice exactly hey or you better be nice", "12:29", "it's gonna work well no I've actually", "12:32", "like been told off for going hard with", "12:34", "the heavy weights like women when I was", "12:36", "like you know just coming up like super", "12:38", "green and like I was just like I'm gonna", "12:40", "kill everyone in the gym there's a", "12:43", "little thing like running at you", "12:44", "throwing over hands and like it went it", "12:46", "land like my coach would be like hey you", "12:48", "got it", "12:49", "you gotta relax cuz like you're landing", "12:51", "over hands on this big guy if he does", "12:54", "the same to you he's gonna put you out", "12:55", "and I was like shit I never thought", "12:56", "about that cuz I just assumed like he", "12:59", "wouldn't yeah well no I'm not that I", "13:01", "just assumed that", "13:02", "make me landing a hard punch on a", "13:05", "heavyweight isn't gonna hurt as much as", "13:07", "me landing a hard punch on someone", "13:09", "closer to my size Frisch it makes sense", "13:11", "not like Oh", "13:13", "your neck is bigger yeah you know so", "13:15", "yeah but it's still like if the guy is", "13:17", "getting rot then right that's if he gets", "13:20", "bad and far astray", "13:21", "yeah yeah if he's getting his head", "13:23", "turned and that's what like it your chin", "13:25", "can only take so much so it's like it's", "13:27", "a lot less than like if I was throwing a", "13:29", "body shot you know like that's it's a", "13:32", "little easier to be mean right yeah", "13:34", "you've obviously gone through some", "13:38", "improvements and some change like what's", "13:40", "changed with you over the last like four", "13:42", "or five fights because you you keep", "13:45", "getting steadily better but particularly", "13:48", "the last two I think you should be on a", "13:50", "four fight win streak because there was", "13:56", "get out of pronounce her name down Union", "13:59", "yeah down in down in Yin yeah she and", "14:09", "she's on this card too oh yeah I thought", "14:13", "that was a bad decision but you you had", "14:16", "her locked up in the chat so I get", "14:17", "sometimes when I want to do commentary", "14:20", "people get mad at me like either the", "14:21", "fighters or other people but that was", "14:23", "one where fans of her got mad at me", "14:26", "because you guys were right in front and", "14:28", "you had her in a triangle and I was", "14:30", "yelling pulled ahead I was yelling pull", "14:33", "her head pull her head you had it locked", "14:35", "up locked up I'm like she's got it she's", "14:37", "got it she's got it I might pull the", "14:39", "head pull the head and people like you", "14:41", "fucking dick telling her to pull the", "14:42", "head if I heard you I thought your", "14:46", "recorder", "14:47", "idiot so let's see we're literally right", "14:50", "there yeah yeah it's like you had it", "14:54", "really it was so locked in but I felt", "14:57", "like that was a shit decision it wasn't", "15:00", "the worst decision I've ever seen we've", "15:01", "seen some really bad ones lately but it", "15:03", "was it was not good it wasn't so that", "15:05", "would have put you on a for fight win", "15:06", "streak right the Hannah cipher is when", "15:07", "Hannah ciphers is tough and she's like", "15:09", "physically tough she's a like a strong", "15:12", "girl yeah you know and when you got her", "15:15", "down and smash it with those elbows was", "15:16", "like something's going on but you're", "15:19", "you're on another level do you feel it", "15:22", "yeah I did I did I don't know it's uh I", "15:26", "had a lot of like I don't know I guess", "15:30", "ups and downs in my career like it's", "15:33", "literally like up-down up-down like one", "15:36", "loss and one loss and I think after the", "15:39", "Randa fight I fought random Marko's", "15:42", "about this time last year and and I was", "15:46", "just so pissed at the way that went down", "15:47", "because I was like super nervous going", "15:49", "into it I felt like this that was gonna", "15:52", "be a fight that kind of set me above the", "15:55", "heap because Rand is so tough and she", "15:58", "kind of has that same like up-down that", "16:00", "I do so I'm like okay this is gonna set", "16:02", "me apart I'm gonna get a streak going", "16:04", "I'm this is gonna be the fight that puts", "16:06", "me in the rankings and I and I put a lot", "16:08", "of weight on it and and I had like ESPN", "16:10", "following me that week too so I was just", "16:13", "super nervous and like the entire time", "16:15", "during the fight like I wasn't in the", "16:18", "fight like I was overthinking every", "16:21", "musician like there was a point where I", "16:24", "had ran up against again the fight seems", "16:26", "like it was 30 minutes long even those", "16:29", "like two minutes you know but like the", "16:31", "moment that I had her up against the", "16:33", "cage I remember like just thinking oh if", "16:36", "I hold her here she can't do anything to", "16:38", "me and that's like the exact opposite of", "16:41", "what you should be thinking in a fight", "16:42", "you should be thinking I need to hurt", "16:45", "her you know like I need to hurt her I", "16:46", "need to do whatever it whatever it takes", "16:48", "to look like I'm trying to finish the", "16:50", "fight so I hesitated my corner was", "16:53", "yelling elbow I didn't throw the elbow", "16:55", "ran it through the elbow and then from", "16:57", "there I was just like like two steps", "16:59", "behind I fell", "17:00", "like and so that fog was a really weird", "17:04", "thing for me because I had never really", "17:06", "thought about the mental side of", "17:08", "fighting like I thought I was doing", "17:10", "everything right like I would visualize", "17:12", "and you know tell myself all positive", "17:15", "things and you know do do everything", "17:18", "that you you think you have to do before", "17:20", "a fight but that just kind of showed me", "17:24", "like I'm not doing enough because I knew", "17:26", "I had the skills to beat her but or at", "17:29", "least the skills to make it look more", "17:30", "competitive but I didn't show it do you", "17:32", "think was the added element the cameras", "17:34", "falling year-round that just put this", "17:35", "additional place yeah like it like the", "17:37",

and", "71:13", "that's what's coming up is like abuse or", "71:15", "not abuse animal rights dipsh it's crazy", "71:20", "I do feel really guilty about when I", "71:23", "went to Thailand just to like train out", "71:25", "there and I did one of those like", "71:28", "elephant right I did too and I do thank", "71:32", "you I'm glad yeah my whole family was", "71:34", "like that was so fun like I'm

"72:21", "front of them no it's pretty close to", "72:27", "what an elephant looks like what it says", "72:29", "the truth about elephant paintings what", "72:31", "is the truth well human it must be like", "72:32", "a stencil that they had mmm they're just", "72:36", "like tracing it or not tracing that but", "72:39", "like they must have trained them to make", "72:40", "a certain shape so I

known", "112:58", "for having like knockout power or crazy", "113:00", "hands but she dropped her like a good", "113:02", "like two or three times and in the", "113:04", "Torres fight so I can see

legs like", "113:28", "every now and then then like eventually", "113:30", "she closed the distance and took it out", "113:32", "but it's like she sacrifices her chin to", "113:35", "get that distance you know and like same", "113:38", "thing with the rose fight she was gonna", "113:39", "pick the part the entire", "113:41", "sacrificing her head to get in and get", "113:44", "the throw or whatever and then finally", "113:47", "like you know it gave out on her in the", "113:50", "Whaley fight so I wasn't like super", "113:52", "surprised I was I I mean everyone was", "113:55", "surprised so I won't say that but I did", "113:58", "see that coming eventually like I'm like", "114:01", "eventually someone's gonna put her out", "114:03", "just because it's not just the person's", "114:06",

thought", "114:25", "would happen when I fought her like I", "114:28", "didn't go into that fight thinking oh", "114:30", "man it's gonna suck you know I was like", "114:32", "dude I can catch her like she drops her", "114:35", "hands when she comes forward like my I", "114:37", "can strike going backwards like I know", "114:39", "I'm gonna catch her and like I can put", "114:41", "her out because of the way she strikes", "114:43", "so I've always seen that her hands were", "114:45", "a bit sloppy even though she's super", "114:46", "aggressive and the fact that she's so", "114:48", "aggressive gives her that much success", "114:51", "like you you can't ignore the fact that", "114:54", "she's punching you as much as she is but", "114:56", "it's still like very offensive and like", "115:01", "with zero defensive minds so so yeah I", "115:04", "wasn't like super surprised when someone", "115:07", "finally did drop her but you know I", "115:10", "hadn't really seen that much of a way", "115:12", "Lee Sang so so I was surprised that she", "115:15", "was able to get the title of that that", "115:17", "fast have you ever seen her strength", "115:19", "conditioning routine that she does know", "115:23", "hard yeah she goes hard it's pretty wild", "115:26", "free wild to watch it's very inspiring", "115:28", "how do you feel like she matches up with", "115:30", "Johanna cuz that the fights is real", "115:32", "that's real soon um I I think it's gonna", "115:35", "be I think it's gonna be an even match I", "115:38", "think she has a lot of output I think", "115:41", "she isn't afraid to go to the ground I", "115:44", "saw that and when she fought tisha they", "115:48", "had like a lot of crazy scrambles she", "115:50", "had good reverses for like teaches", "115:51", "takedown attempts and", "115:53", "stuff and and yeah just think it's gonna", "115:56", "be like she's gonna force Johanna to", "115:59", "move and to react more than most people", "116:02", "I think like as long as she's like I", "116:05", "haven't really seen I haven't really", "116:07", "paid attention to like how much head", "116:10", "movement she has but I do know that she", "116:13", "just throws a lot of volume and wherever", "116:15", "the fight goes she seems comfortable so", "116:17", "I've never seen her in a spot where she", "116:19", "looks like Oh what do I do here you know", "116:22", "like you see people freaking out against", "116:24", "the cage or freaking out when they get", "116:25", "taken down and she seems to float she", "116:28", "has that athletic flow through", "116:29", "everything so yeah that's the one thing", "116:31", "I think she has going for her but I do", "116:33", "think Johannes reach is what's made her", "116:37", "so dominate she's a big ol girl", "116:39", "like watching her fight and drive there", "116:43", "was a moment where like she's pushing", "116:44", "and draught up against the cage and she", "116:46", "looks like a bagel like praying", "116:48", "mantis-like you know like just like", "116:51", "biting someone's head off like and dried", "116:53", "looks like this little thing so like", "116:55", "she's a big girl with really long reach", "116:58", "really long legs and everything so I", "117:01", "think it surprises here back at 1:15", "117:03", "does she really do well I was gonna try", "117:06", "to like fill in that last minute I don't", "117:08", "know if you heard but it like kind of up", "117:12", "to my like I don't know like props or", "117:15", "whatever when she was about the fight", "117:18", "Michelle there were rumors that she", "117:21", "wasn't gonna make weight and so people", "117:24", "were scrambling and then my manager what", "117:27", "yeah I think I could

wait", "119:10", "either yeah yeah everyone was talking", "119:13", "about it and then somehow somebody knew", "119:15", "that my name was in the mix like Angela", "119:17", "Hill might fill in for Michelle instead", "119:21", "of fill in for Jana like and because she", "119:24", "was like the name that was that they", "119:28", "were promoting for the fight so so they", "119:30", "wanted the former champ to get her fight", "119:33", "so they were like all right if it comes", "119:35", "down to an Angela bull fighter at 125", "119:38", "yeah so I was pretty stoked I mean I", "119:40", "felt like Yoanna does a lot of things", "119:44", "and it's similar with my matchup that I", "119:46", "have now only she's a lot bigger", "119:48", "Jana does a lot of things that I've seen", "119:50", "a lot of you know and training just like", "119:52", "in my in my first years of Moi's I like", "119:56", "she has a very conventional style when", "120:00", "it comes to Moy time and she's just very", "120:02", "good at it so a fight with Jana is", "120:04", "always something that I have wanted to", "120:06", "have just because I felt like it would", "120:09", "be something that I've seen before be", "120:11", "like I'm not gonna be you know I'm not", "120:14", "gonna be afraid of the clinch", "120:17", "you know which is really good and I'm", "120:19", "not gonna be afraid of the clinch I'm", "120:20", "not gonna be afraid of when I elbows", "120:22", "gonna come because of elbow sparred like", "120:25", "my entire fight career so it's like it's", "120:27", "like things that I see with her are less", "120:30", "scary than a fight with someone that", "120:32", "she's beat before like and rot or or", "120:34", "Gedaliah or someone like that so we're", "120:37", "gonna learn about her a lot coming this", "120:39", "coming fight like what she's got left", "120:41", "you know because that the transition 25", "120:43", "didn't really work out like Shevchenko", "120:46", "was just a little do too much for shift", "120:48", "ankud already beat her outside the UFC", "120:49", "and then beat her again and then it just", "120:52", "didn't look like she had the firepower", "120:54", "to keep her offer at 125 and then so she", "120:57", "goes down to 15 again but we know how", "120:59", "hard it was for her to make 15 and", "121:02", "that's one of the things that they had", "121:03", "said her camp it said about her chin", "121:05", "when when she fought rose like she just", "121:08", "couldn't take a shot it was because she", "121:10", "was so depleted yeah so we'll find out", "121:12", "cuz way Lee hits fucking hard yeah yeah", "121:15", "and she's like I don't know the Yanis so", "121:18", "determined like I feel like she'd kill", "121:20", "herself to make Lee mm-hmm you know yeah", "121:24", "you know the long combat sports career", "121:26", "when you know and at a certain point in", "121:28", "time you got a wonder like when that", "121:31", "catches up to you or you know one things", "121:33", "that she was saying that she was in a", "121:34", "real bad relationship and there was a", "121:35", "giant distraction and now she's done", "121:37", "with that and that was a contributing", "121:39", "factor to a lot of her losses so we're", "121:41", "gonna find out because you know when you", "121:43", "go back to like when she fought Jessica", "121:44", "Penang she was a scariest woman alive", "121:46", "she was fuckin ferocious yeah when she", "121:49", "was the champ and she was lighting", "121:51", "everybody on fire she was terrifying yes", "121:53", "she was so aggressive and so technical", "121:56", "yeah she also had a lot of fighters who", "122:00", "weren't that technically sound sure", "122:03", "striking or at least not confident with", "122:05", "their striking yeah you know so when she", "122:08", "did fight someone who was good who could", "122:11", "who was actually a better striker than", "122:13", "her and Rose like the fact that just the", "122:15", "fact that Rose could move laterally", "122:17", "you know like Jana was always like a", "122:19", "back-and-forth fighter because that's", "122:21", "like her style of very muy Thai and Rose", "122:25", "just moving to the side every now and", "122:27", "then", "122:27", "having head movement I think that really", "122:29", "fucked her up and like it's hard when", "122:31", "you when you fight someone like that for", "122:33", "the first time or even spar something", "122:34", "like that for the first time you can't", "122:36", "find them you know all your punches miss", "122:38", "you gasps out you freaking out because", "122:40", "you're missing your punches then you're", "122:41", "getting countered and it's like a lot to", "122:43", "deal with for straightforward more Thai", "122:47", "fighters that is a weird thing about", "122:49", "more Thai right because we don't we", "122:52", "don't have footwork leh we just stand a", "122:54", "bang like really only a bitch you have", "122:56", "run away from a fight you know like go", "122:58", "to our footwork like Sancho Sanchez got", "123:01", "crazy is like the only one licensed so", "123:08", "since I can do everything but he's so", "123:11", "good you would think that someone else", "123:13", "would mimic that style it's it's it's", "123:15", "one of those styles that are just so", "123:18", "hard to mimic like in the sport", "123:22", "traditionally is not his style", "123:24", "he's very unorthodox so look at any", "123:26", "unorthodox fighter you're not gonna see", "123:29", "a million Dominick Cruz like copycats", "123:31", "coming out you know you see like wanna", "123:33", "do yeah they try but they're never gonna", "123:35", "be down you know so so yeah Sanchez like", "123:39", "that kind of fighter was like he was", "123:41", "brought in doing this like very like", "123:43", "kind of I wouldn't say still but just", "123:47", "very like predictable style and he just", "123:49", "made it weird and made it his own", "123:51", "that's why he's so he's whose toes oh", "123:53", "yeah only when I'm buying just Ally", "123:56", "Schieffelin every flat foot no no never", "123:59", "and like he always he always knows how", "124:02", "to pull you know he can pull the the", "124:06", "counters up so like he knows exactly he", "124:09", "had a twitch in order to make you go all", "124:11", "and then boom you know like it could be", "124:13", "a foot it could be like a I don't know a", "124:16", "hand like it give me anything cuz he", "124:18", "just comes from all angles like he also", "124:20", "throws he'll throw a head kick when he's", "124:22", "two inches away from you yeah dude wild", "124:24", "shit like

a lighter-weight", "124:46", "yeah for a TIE fighter yeah like that's", "124:49", "like you start at like 6 not there you", "124:52", "know well I think that style has", "124:54", "preserved him in a lot of ways their", "124:56", "footwork and movement stock because he's", "124:58", "not he's not just catching and returning", "125:00", "and standing in front like a lot of", "125:02", "those guys do great he's always very", "125:04", "elusive right it's not a lot of those", "125:06", "lured Zil is pretty elusive but there's", "125:08", "not a lot of like really elusive guards", "125:10", "and
