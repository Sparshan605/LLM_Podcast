fight and everything", "22:56", "that happened around him and there was", "22:57", "surrounding him like what would the", "23:00", "things you said would happen outside in", "23:01", "the club and they'd seen that you know", "23:03", "he was like the national asshole right", "23:06", "now and I was like the National good guy", "23:08", "is that right so and that was like the", "23:11", "perfect clash and then of course yeah I", "23:14", "beat him so everybody's like oh you are", "23:18", "here right so that that's like that's", "23:20", "how everything a little bit exploded but", "23:23", "but again for you that's unsatisfying", "23:25", "the way it happened though he gets his", "23:27", "arm injured yeah in whatever way reason", "23:31", "or whatever he thinks happen but like", "23:34", "you cuz you're suspicious I'm suspicious", "23:36", "about it so because he's looking at one", "23:38", "arm then looking at the other arm and", "23:40", "it's just it's a fake thing for me but", "23:42", "it's like but that's what I have with", "23:44", "this whole thing that he tries to create", "23:47", "it's like when he's getting announced", "23:51", "and everything's like butter", "23:53", "hurry 110 something fights 90 knockouts", "23:57", "but I'm obsessed with what I'm doing I'm", "24:02", "when I'm when I fight and when I have an", "24:05", "opponent and I'm fighting I'm looking", "24:07", "for everything I want to know everything", "24:09", "about you and everything these days you", "24:14", "can find on the Internet", "24:15", "so when I'm looking on the internet for", "24:18", "example you look at Wikipedia and", "24:19", "looking all", "24:20", "of the fight from back in the days k1", "24:22", "days and even before that you maybe get", "24:25", "to 6070 fights so where are the other", "24:29", "fights does that mean like when you were", "24:32", "younger in the youth period you did like", "24:35", "40 something fights did you knock", "24:38", "everybody out I don't know my training", "24:40", "has been there for years", "24:42", "even before that and he doesn't know", "24:44", "about it so that's strange because", "24:46", "everything is documented on on the", "24:49", "internet everything you can find on the", "24:51", "Internet so so you think his records", "24:53", "inflated I think so it's got some crazy", "24:56", "knockouts though he got yeah yeah yeah", "24:59", "Stefan Leko that weird Lucas but that's", "25:03", "what I said he got he's got net he's got", "25:07", "amazing records but yeah I think it's", "25:09", "not as crazy as they make it to be which", "25:13", "is crazy because the reality is pretty", "25:16", "crazy I mean you don't need to hype it", "25:18", "up any more than it really is", "25:19", "hmm right nobody's been there for years", "25:21", "like he did 100 something fights there's", "25:23", "so many knockouts but when I look at it", "25:26", "is I can't find it mmm because but maybe", "25:30", "it's there maybe today maybe it's from", "25:32", "years ago whatever I don't know but", "25:34", "that's all that I'm looking at you're", "25:35", "suspicious", "25:36", "I'm suspicious about because when I look", "25:38", "at Wikipedia and I'm looking when he was", "25:39", "around you start from when he was around", "25:41", "16 till now it's like 60 70 fights it's", "25:45", "funny when you look at him in the early", "25:46", "days - he was so skinny yeah", "25:48", "I give him when he fought Stefan Leko", "25:50", "yeah and then now he's fucking jacked", "25:52", "yeah but he put so much time into", "25:55", "strength strength and conditioning", "25:57", "workout so you could see like he's", "25:58", "always doing some crazy strength routine", "26:00", "yeah yeah so do you do a lot of strength", "26:04", "and conditioning like what are your", "26:06", "workouts like it's supposed to like how", "26:07", "much skill work do you do and how much", "26:09", "strength and conditioning work I think", "26:10", "it's pretty even balance out I think at", "26:13", "range strength like three times a week", "26:15", "but even my strength between is so", "26:19", "balanced out with doing strength and", "26:22", "then the same muscle group I also do", "26:26", "conditioning so first I'll do low reps", "26:29", "and then do a lot of reps because these", "26:32", "muscles are", "26:33", "for me aren't supposed to be big they", "26:36", "need to be strong and it give me they", "26:39", "need to be making the same punch 50", "26:41", "times with the same strength so ten", "26:44", "times really hard no 50 times on the", "26:46", "same strength same level so that's how", "26:49", "we approach that and then yeah we got", "26:53", "skill training like two three times a", "26:56", "week like pad work", "26:58", "I got explosive training so I try to", "27:01", "always look also at different sports", "27:04", "that's soccer and Mac football and it's", "27:08", "ice skating and they all have a certain", "27:10", "type of explosiveness that they train in", "27:13", "a certain way so I try to pick", "27:16", "everything from everywhere and work with", "27:19", "that so we created a training that we", "27:22", "just used for explosive for being", "27:24", "explosive so it there's nothing to do", "27:28", "with endurance because it's maybe like", "27:29", "45 minutes and it's just a few seconds", "27:32", "you go go back go you come back because", "27:38", "logically for a big guy you're slow when", "27:41", "something is big and heavy it's slow and", "27:44", "that's what we try to do we try to be as", "27:45", "fast as possible for a big guy so a lot", "27:49", "of plyometric type stiff explosive type", "27:51", "stuff yeah no way you'd letter yeah like", "27:53", "that okay yeah so when you do this", "27:56", "constant when you were saying that you", "27:58", "lift low reps and then high reps yeah so", "28:01", "you do like heavy weights first yeah so", "28:03", "just try to max out or get the the", "28:06", "muscles very tired and then really wear", "28:08", "them out with with reps yeah so we do", "28:10", "but we never go max max so right right", "28:13", "then that like over max what we so you", "28:15", "don't don't go to failure with like a", "28:16", "heavy heavy weight yeah what kind of", "28:18", "stuff are you doing you're doing like", "28:19", "dumbbells kettlebells a lot of a lot of", "28:22", "dumbbells yeah yeah there's not as much", "28:25", "loose weight as possible like a few with", "28:28", "the barbell but it's much with with the", "28:30", "dumbbells because that's when you gotta", "28:32", "keep in balance and work on this core", "28:34", "and stuff like that so what about our", "28:36", "sparring how often you spar week", "28:39", "normally like twice two three times a", "28:42", "week and when you do it are you doing", "28:44", "hard spot I know you're from Holland oh", "28:46", "yeah fucking", "28:46", "Hollan guys like spar Hardman do you do", "28:49", "a lot of hiring is it more technical", "28:51", "like how do you how do you bounce it out", "28:53", "um it depends depends on who's who's in", "28:57", "because now in preparation we're gonna", "28:59", "fly guys in and then yeah it's gonna be", "29:02", "pretty tough sparring because that's", "29:04", "what you yeah what you got would you get", "29:06", "the guys four right but in the end I'm", "29:08", "always thinking about hey we do hard", "29:11", "sparring but we don't want to injure", "29:13", "each other right there's no point for me", "29:16", "in knocking guys out doing sparring", "29:19", "because yeah I don't have any sparring", "29:22", "partners anymore right", "29:23", "so I do hard sparring kick him hard on", "29:26", "the legs kick him hard on the body and", "29:28", "of course people get knocked knocked", "29:31", "down not knocked out but right down but", "29:33", "you don't go full blast to the head no", "29:36", "that's a Holland thing right I mean", "29:38", "there's a lot of guys do it yeah spar", "29:40", "like that yeah we go we go pretty tough", "29:44", "we go pretty tough to the to the head", "29:46", "black eyes bloody nose but I'm always", "29:50", "like 90% know I'm always looking at like", "29:54", "hey or when I'm making a move and I can", "29:57", "make a head kick I always try to when I", "30:00", "see I'm gonna make a full hit tries to", "30:04", "keep it back just a little bit mm-hmm so", "30:06", "I think yeah but just being controlled I", "30:08", "think it's very important so I trained", "30:10", "with all the guys all the heavyweight", "30:11", "guys from glory I trained with with and", "30:14", "of course you do heart sparring but we", "30:17", "do not add from my point of view I don't", "30:20", "want to injure them right yeah I mean it", "30:23", "only makes sense I mean that's one of", "30:25", "the most valuable things right is to", "30:26", "have high-level training partners", "30:27", "exactly and if you guys think you're", "30:29", "gonna put him to sleep all the time", "30:30", "they're not really interested in spawn", "30:32", "for example I trained with Benny Alec", "30:33", "Bowie he's like the number two or number", "30:35", "three in glory and I fought him twice", "30:39", "but we trained to get it reach now at my", "30:42", "gym and I try to make him better say hey", "30:45", "you try this try that and because if", "30:48", "he's better you're better exactly and", "30:50", "people like no no I don't want to train", "30:52", "with competition because then they know", "30:54", "what I'm gonna do", "30:55", "that's true but you also know what", "30:57", "they're doing so it", "30:59", "it depends on how you approach things", "31:01", "where every negative thing has a", "31:03", "positive thing at it as well so that's I", "31:05", "really always I'm always looking at the", "31:08", "positive things and always try to", "31:10", "surround myself with people people that", "31:12", "are positive and yeah that's that's the", "31:15", "vibe that I'm going with because that's", "31:17", "what works well that's also the mark of", "31:19", "a confident fighter but you know that", "31:21", "you're the best so if you help him he's", "31:24", "just gonna help you become even better", "31:25", "than you are currently yeah but you", "31:26", "gotta be you gotta be comfortable with", "31:30", "that because you also see a lot of guys", "31:32", "that like I'm not gonna help the guy I'm", "31:36", "not gonna tell them whatever because", "31:37", "this is not gonna be good for me but and", "31:39", "then everybody that gets better can help", "31:43", "me get better as well so I always put", "31:46", "position myself as a sponge trying to", "31:50", "get this much info in wherever I am so", "31:54", "I'm now really going into acting I want", "31:57", "to I want to act so now kevin was on",

"46:04", "high-intensity training and interval", "46:05", "training and all these different", "46:07", "plyometrics and cardio and different", "46:10", "things but many of them will tell you", "46:12", "that one of the more important things is", "46:14", "just long range running yeah because", "46:17", "when you do this long-distance running", "46:19", "when you're on five six seven miles when", "46:21", "you do that you develop this cardio base", "46:24", "yeah you can just keep working and you", "46:27", "can recover faster yeah and it's just I", "46:29", "mean that's one of the things if you go", "46:31", "back and look at old-time fighters you", "46:33", "know back", "46:33", "Muhammad Ali Sugar Ray Robinson all", "46:35", "those guys everybody ran but Rocky", "46:37",

yeah that's what", "46:45", "we do yeah but it's just I always feel", "46:49", "like running is not it's not the base of", "46:53", "your it's not most important but it's", "46:56", "like a really important factor of the", "46:58", "total package right so it's just you're", "47:01", "yet the oxygen you have like for keeping", "47:05", "the same pace for a longer a longer time", "47:08", "then of course the explosiveness that we", "47:11", "use during a fight is important but also", "47:13", "just your basic lung capacity should be", "47:18", "should be big as well what about heavy", "47:20", "bag work yeah we do it but not that much", "47:24", "yeah I think like once a week some more", "47:27", "pad work more technical things yeah not", "47:30", "like as I see some guy it's really", "47:32", "interesting how different camps", "47:34", "different fighters different trainers", "47:36", "prefer different preparation methods", "47:38", "yeah and some swear by intervals on the", "47:40", "heavy heavy bags and swear by doing", "47:43", "rounds on the heavy bag you know and", "47:45", "some some don't think it's that critical", "47:46", "yeah I think for everybody is different", "47:48", "but like for me throughout all those", "47:51", "years I've been trying different stuff", "47:53", "and I think now I created the right", "47:57", "combination of different trainings just", "48:00", "polishing everything and I think I found", "48:03", "the right way to get fit because I don't", "48:06", "need to get I need to get better I", "48:08", "always I'm always looking to get better", "48:10", "but you get better by putting in the", "48:13", "work but I'm always looking at how can I", "48:16", "change my training up what would be an", "48:20", "add on what I'm in what I already have", "48:22", "right so now I think I created the right", "48:27", "combination but and still I'm looking to", "48:29", "add stuff on but I think I created the", "48:32", "right way to get fit for a fight because", "48:36", "I've shown that throughout all those", "48:37", "years I've shown that I'm fitter than", "48:40", "all the rest and that's that's a part", "48:44", "but still I think the biggest", "48:47", "differences that everybody is strong and", "48:52", "everybody's fit and everybody can fight", "48:54", "but the biggest difference is mentally", "48:57", "what happens to you mentally when you", "49:00", "get to the fourth and fifth round I", "49:03", "think that's the most important thing", "49:05", "how strongly you mentally to continue", "49:09", "fighting a lot of people when you feel", "49:12", "like I always for the people that do not", "49:15", "understand what this what this fighting", "49:18", "game is what happens to you when you're", "49:21", "in the ring or in an octagon so you can", "49:24", "I always compared with driving a car", "49:26", "you're driving a car and the last 4050", "49:32", "miles the the gas light comes

when", "71:12", "he passed away like almost two years ago", "71:14", "it's just yeah it was tough was tough", "71:17", "especially when the the relationship we", "71:19", "had wasn't like was like on
