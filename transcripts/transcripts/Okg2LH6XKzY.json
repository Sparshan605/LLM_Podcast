"52:08", "in front of us is gonna do a slightly", "52:10", "bit better than chance and the reason", "52:11", "was slightly better than chance is there", "52:13", "are a small fraction of people who are", "52:15", "such epically bad Liars that there's", "52:18", "just we're not gonna lose those people", "52:20", "like we those are obvious one thing that", "52:22", "you can tell those if it's an area of", "52:24", "your own personal expertise right like", "52:26", "if someone tried to talk to you about", "52:28", "what it takes to write a book and get a", "52:30", "book published and get a

"concepts that you have there you go", "101:19", "there's got to be a way to make this", "101:21", "work but that way that I just did is not", "101:23", "the way I will always trust the reaction", "101:26", "you get in other words you don't tell a", "101:27", "joke it bombs and you say actually I", "101:29", "think it was their problem not mine ever", "101:31", "that's never their problem there's not a", "101:33", "chance in hell you can have a bad", "101:35", "audience where a good joke doesn't go", "101:37", "over because they're drunk and they're", "101:38", "not paying attention to their heckling", "101:40", "that's possible yeah but that's the", "101:42", "anomaly", "101:43", "the its if you have a bit and you think", "101:46", "it's a great bin the audience doesn't", "101:48", "laugh they're right mm-hmm you know", "101:50", "maybe another audience would laugh maybe", "101:53", "you're doing it in the wrong demographic", "101:56", "or what-have-you but most likely that", "102:00", "joke sucks yeah and most likely you have", "102:02", "these ideas and you need to figure out", "102:05", "how to rework them like Chris Rock told", "102:07", "me that that he says that famous bit", "102:10", "that I love black people I hate the", "102:13", "n-word right that bit he said took him a", "102:16", "year to work out a full year he said it", "102:19", "was bombing he couldn't get it to work", "102:20", "right", "102:21", "he'll fuck up his act but he knew there", "102:24", "was a way to do it and then it became", "102:26", "one of the greatest bits of all time it", "102:29", "became this incredible classic bit but", "102:32", "that was from him grinding just chipping", "102:34", "away at it reworking it bringing it", "102:37", "onstage it eats shit you bring it back", "102:39", "you go over it you ponder it you ask", "102:41", "questions of other great writers like", "102:44", "what do you think you know No maybe then", "102:47", "and then you try it again and it keeps", "102:48", "doing it he does does it a hundred times", "102:50", "or 200 times and then eventually it", "102:53", "becomes a bullet proof and then he gets", "102:54", "it down to that form that you see it on", "102:56", "his comedy special where it's just boom", "102:58", "punchline BAM punchline boom punchline", "103:01", "BAM and people like because it's so good", "103:04", "but there's a process to doing that and", "103:06", "sometimes you have this idea in your", "103:08", "head and you're like I think there's", "103:10", "something there", "103:11", "I just got to figure out how to get into", "103:13", "their head yeah and then I got to figure", "103:15", "out how to make it in a way what's the", "103:17", "most palatable way for people to digest", "103:19", "this idea because comedy is essentially", "103:22", "a mass hypnosis right you're getting the", "103:24", "audience to allow you to think for them", "103:26", "for a brief period of time and so if", "103:28", "you're at your best", "103:31", "the punchlines are sneaky they come", "103:33", "where you don't expect them you take", "103:35", "people on this ride they're assuming", "103:37", "because they're letting you think for", "103:38", "them that you're a thoughtful person", "103:40", "you're not gonna make them feel bad for", "103:42", "liking you and that's one of things that", "103:43", "people really hate you say something", "103:44", "mean or something thoughtless you", "103:47", "portray yeah you betrayed their trust", "103:49", "because they've trusted you to think for", "103:51", "them yeah so you have to be considerate", "103:53", "about people's sensibilities and", "103:55", "feelings you know and when you're", "103:57", "especially when you're breaching a", "103:58", "sensitive issue like it you have to you", "104:01", "have to dance you have to do you have to", "104:03", "figure out a way to make this thing", "104:07", "compatible into people's thought", "104:09", "patterns it's funny I you know I don't", "104:11", "I'm not a stand-up comedian but I gave a", "104:13", "lot of speeches like in in conferences", "104:18", "and corporate settings which is a very", "104:20", "in some ways a very different animal in", "104:21", "some ways quite a similar animal I've", "104:24", "been doing it for 20 odd years now and", "104:26", "the thing I'm always that blows me away", "104:31", "is how different audiences are hmm like", "104:37", "and I one thing that you after doing it", "104:40", "for about 10 years you start to get a", "104:42", "little bit smarter about reading the", "104:45", "room at the beginning to know who they", "104:48", "are and what and it's you know it makes", "104:50", "a difference like there are some some", "104:55", "audiences are generous and they'll if", "104:58", "they see the in my case the punchline is", "105:01", "not necessarily a joke but it's the the", "105:03", "payoff to whatever story I'm telling", "105:04", "some people when they see it coming if", "105:08", "you think about it as a line mm-hmm", "105:10", "they'll reward you the minute they see", "105:11", "it they see it off in the horizon yeah", "105:14", "oh it's coming and they encourage you", "105:16", "yes some people will wait until the last", "105:19", "possible moment and then some people", "105:21", "will wait a beat after the punchline is", "105:24", "over and then think about it and reward", "105:26", "you those three audiences may that makes", "105:30", "a world of difference in how you tell", "105:33", "the story in your expectation going in", "105:35", "in you know because if you if you think", "105:38", "it's an early rewarding audience and", "105:40", "it's a late rewarding audience you can", "105:42", "get you'd be ten minutes in and you're", "105:43", "totally bummed out because you think", "105:45", "it's a disaster but in fact it's not", "105:47", "like and then you get I develop all of", "105:49", "these short hands about audiences I", "105:52", "don't know if they're true or not but in", "105:55", "my experience I remember once giving a", "105:57", "talk to a group of engineers on a early", "106:02", "on a Monday morning in Minneapolis in", "106:04", "February so it's freezing it's 8 o'clock", "106:06", "in the morning they're engineers and", "106:08", "they're all
