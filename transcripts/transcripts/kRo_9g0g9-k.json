damn", "70:38", "close how close seven feet hey man when", "70:43", "you're running it through a hallway it's", "70:44", "tough sometimes you know if there's", "70:51", "there is no 100% solution like it's true", "70:54", "I get it I mean yeah but if an animal", "70:56", "doesn't know you're there and you're", "70:57", "setting up and it's a hundred-yard shot", "70:58", "and you have a 3000 and you don't even", "71:02", "need to get 200 yards realistic you can", "71:03", "be a 300 or 500 or whatever you feel", "71:05", "comfortable shooting at if you want meat", "71:10", "though yeah it's the way to go but also", "71:13", "why not enjoy the experience I don't", "71:15", "think there's anything wrong with to me", "71:17", "it's a challenge it more than a", "71:18", "challenge in man oh boy it sounds gay", "71:20", "but it's a journey I enjoy I don't know", "71:24", "just journeys are gay it depends I guess", "71:26", "on the type of journey how do you feel", "71:28", "about the Lord of

to hit what you're aiming at", "71:49", "with a bow in exponentially more so that", "71:51", "every time you add a yard to the", "71:53", "distance I enjoy that the animals are", "71:56", "they have instincts that are amazing and", "71:59", "that you cannot defeat their nose and", "72:01", "that you can't control I enjoy all of", "72:03", "that that to me is I think and I'm", "72:08", "enjoying

because", "72:56", "that's the issue that a lot of people", "72:58", "that are sort of in the animal rights", "73:00", "activist side of things one of the", "73:02", "things that they would have an issue", "73:03", "with is the enjoyment part of it but I", "73:05", "can't help it if some people are pussies", "73:07", "it's just the the challenge of like", "73:11", "doing things that are hard is enjoyable", "73:13", "and and succeeding at things that are", "73:17", "difficult to do is also enjoyable yeah", "73:19", "why can't you be happy about winning why", "73:22", "can't you be happy about
