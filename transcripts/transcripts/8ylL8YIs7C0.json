"08:08", "yeah he's powerlifting and you know it's", "08:11", "been doing that basically his whole life", "08:12", "these guys are what their take on it is", "08:16", "essentially they're at least the way", "08:19", "they think is that most people that are", "08:22", "talking about diet they really don't", "08:23", "know what the fuck they're talking about", "08:25", "even though you might be able

you report how", "08:43", "much better you feel the people that are", "08:44", "actually training really hard those are", "08:46", "the ones you should rely on and he's", "08:48", "saying for him personally he's never", "08:50", "felt better never been leaner", "08:52", "yeah and a big part of it I mean this", "08:54", "just returns to diet personalization and", "08:56", "customization as a whole you know we", "08:58", "live in an era where you can self", "08:59", "quantify pretty easily with genetics and", "09:01", "you can find out what ancestry you came", "09:04", "from what blood

that", "10:37", "are dealing with constant rain I wonder", "10:39", "if that would have some sort of an", "10:40", "impact on them probably even more if you", "10:42", "come from that population I

but it's supposed to", "11:29", "be very beautiful out there", "11:30", "it's it's gorgeous so I'm about 25", "11:33", "minutes from Coeur d'Alene oh really", "11:35", "yeah okay yeah that's was amazing I've", "11:37", "never lines beautiful I used to go over", "11:39", "there I race the Ironman and they'd have", "11:42", "that in Lake Coeur d'Alene it's an", "11:43", "iconic race just because I mean the", "11:45", "mountains the lake everything is just", "11:47", "gorgeous I saw pictures of the lake", "11:48", "where people were taking photographs of", "11:50", "the bottom of the lake like from a", "11:52", "hundred feet 100 feet deep of water you", "11:54", "can see the bottom of the lake it's that", "11:55", "air that is insane it's kind of funny", "11:58", "because its

lot of time", "12:29", "swimming there I'd probably spent some", "12:30", "time in the infrared sauna to spend some", "12:32", "of those medals out so let me ask you", "12:34", "this what's the benefit of infrared", "12:35", "sauna versus traditional song is there a", "12:38", "benefit so the idea is it's cooler you", "12:41", "know I do have an infrared here no way", "12:43", "so you walk into the infrared it's like", "12:45", "a hundred and fifty five to 158 degrees", "12:48", "most of them there's a couple that will", "12:49", "go up to like 170 even though the air is", "12:53", "cooler the actual photons of light that", "12:56", "are being released by the panel's does", "12:58", "your you're surrounded by infrared", "13:00", "panels while you're in there", "13:01", "those penetrate more deeply into tissue", "13:03", "so you wind up getting a deeper sweat", "13:05", "you sweat for a longer time you can stay", "13:07", "in there longer because it's not quite", "13:09", "as hot but you look at like the studies", "13:12", "out of Finland all right these these", "13:14", "studies that show four to five year", "13:16", "lifespan increases from a from a weekly", "13:19", "sauna protocol", "13:20", "you know I think it's like four times a", "13:21", "week for 20 to 30 minutes and the", "13:24", "significant drop in dementia and", "13:27", "Alzheimer's and a lot of these these", "13:28", "mortality risk factors and you look at", "13:31", "the studies that have been done in", "13:32", "athletes where you get almost a wreath", "13:35", "ropo eaten like like a blood doping", "13:37", "effect from sauna exposure when done", "13:39", "post-workout and right you stay in there", "13:41", "for 20 to 30 minutes post-workout all of", "13:43", "these were done in a dry sauna yeah", "13:45", "that's why I use a dry sauna as per run", "13:48", "to Patrick's recommendation I just got", "13:50", "that because she said there's no real", "13:52", "studies like that on an infrared there's", "13:54", "a few metal too so they've analyzed", "13:56", "metal and detoxification and some of", "13:58", "these infrared saunas and they have", "14:00", "found that that you release more through", "14:02", "your sweat you get a deeper sweat so if", "14:04", "your goal is something like", "14:05", "detoxification like when I'm in that I'm", "14:10", "fucking drenched like how could I get", "14:12", "more out of that", "14:13", "have you tried like a like try out like", "14:15", "a 30 minute infrared versus dry I have I", "14:19", "I'm an idiot so I don't feel like I'm", "14:22", "suffering as much so I don't like it", "14:24", "when you're in the infrared you don't", "14:25", "feel like yourself exactly yeah see", "14:26", "that's the thing is and maybe I'm jaded", "14:29", "cuz I'm my infrared like I've got it", "14:31", "I've got a kettlebell in there I've put", "14:32", "my bike in there okay I'll get in there", "14:34", "when I go in there at night actually", "14:37", "like I was telling you we're talking", "14:38", "about those those massage devices those", "14:40", "they saw out there yes so right this OS", "14:42", "ones are like a PSO RIT they're like a", "14:45", "ship in your abs love those things but", "14:47", "they open up your cellar they open up", "14:49", "you need to work them on a lot of", "14:50", "different body parts hmm anyway so I'll", "14:53", "have stuff like that in there and", "14:54", "occasionally do bodywork but I actually", "14:56", "move I exercise in the sauna there's a", "14:59", "sauna that's designed for that what the", "15:02", "fuck is that called again there's a", "15:03", "specific sauna that a lot of UFC guys", "15:06", "are in Vegas and they're building them", "15:09", "in gyms I know Winkeljohn gym Mike like", "15:13", "a TV panel in there yeah yeah they have", "15:15", "televisions in there so you can even", "15:16", "watch things like watch like", "15:18", "directionals or watch some sort of", "15:20", "instructional video on exercise yeah", "15:23", "that's what I think they're doing is", "15:24", "they're trying to have you do your", "15:25", "workout like you look at a screen and", "15:27", "it's sauna and you do your workout while", "15:28", "you're looking at this gets a bit spa I", "15:30", "think it's called fits something like", "15:32", "that yeah but the", "15:34", "the the the hot one that I go into mean", "15:36", "I I sweat so much I have a hard time", "15:39", "believing I would sweat more anywhere", "15:41", "else I mean I'm literally pouring sweat", "15:42", "and I keep that fucker around 190", "15:45", "degrees yeah so I'm I'm really ideal", "15:49", "scenario I would like it I don't have a", "15:50", "dry sauna but I would like to get a", "15:51", "barrel sauna because I have the the", "15:54", "infrared in my basement it's one of", "15:56", "those big ones like the four-person", "15:57", "infrared sauna mmm that you can get into",

looking at", "20:16", "like 50 to 60 grams of DHA or fish oil", "20:20", "to manage like TBI or concussion which", "20:23", "is it's a lot of DHA but if you were", "20:26", "gonna use like a

you", "22:24", "what are you doing with sugar alcohol", "22:26", "how you administering it intravenously", "22:27", "in intravenous mannitol solution if you", "22:30", "do this yourself I do this myself but", "22:33", "you could get this done by a doctor and", "22:34", "when you're doing it elaborate I", "22:35", "recommend you get it done like it sounds", "22:36", "like a good idea I do yeah now what what", "22:38", "kind of dosage you using of mannitol", "22:40", "yeah I don't know it was it was what I", "22:42", "was advised to do by the doc who who", "22:44", "taught me this protocol so remember how", "22:46", "much it was but it was it was like a", "22:49", "vial yeah I do the same thing with nad", "22:52", "every week I do a weekly nad injection", "22:54", "everything it's a yeah push any minute", "22:58", "swish IV ten minutes is pushing it yeah", "23:01", "it hurt I mean so normally if you were", "23:04", "to get five hundred to a thousand", "23:05", "milligrams of nad most people will sit", "23:08", "under a four to A six hour drip IV to do", "23:11", "that mm-hmm and one reason for that that", "23:14", "they say is that you get less of it", "23:16", "degraded by the liver and the kidneys", "23:18", "and the gut as the NAD goes into the", "23:20", "body then it but I think I think that", "23:23", "the bigger factor is simply the fact", "23:25", "that when you do a push like you're", "23:27", "nauseous you feel like your whole body's", "23:29", "on fire I mean if you feel like Superman", "23:30", "afterwards but it's a very very", "23:33", "uncomfortable IV and I don't want", "23:36", "anybody pushing that and except me like", "23:37", "I want to be in charge of the trigger", "23:38", "when I'm putting that thing in because I", "23:40", "got to stop and

pushing down on the", "23:50", "button as things are going yeah yeah", "23:52", "exactly", "23:53", "and it's an intermittent intervals I do", "23:56", "about two like two ticks on the syringe", "24:00", "at a time because it's a 30 ml syringe", "24:02", "so I'll go like two cc's then stop and", "24:05", "you can feel like your heart rate go up", "24:06", "and you get nauseous and and your skin", "24:08", "kind of flushes a little bit and you", "24:10", "breathe it off then you wait like 10 15", "24:12", "seconds and you do another push how", "24:14", "clean if L like his guts were on fire", "24:16", "yeah Kyle I think is a champ I think he", "24:19", "did it in like five minutes or something", "24:22", "which is like for me if I if I can do it", "24:26", "in ten", "24:26", "minutes then I've it's it's absolutely", "24:31", "mind-blowing in terms of how hard that", "24:33", "is really I don't know how he did it in", "24:34", "five minutes but well he's a savage you", "24:36", "know it's interesting too I started to", "24:38", "listen to your podcast with David", "24:39", "Sinclair on the car ride over and he's", "24:42", "talking about this nmn stuff which", "24:44", "supposedly when orderly administered", "24:46", "simulates a lot of what an are", "24:48", "nicotinamide Rui beside which is one", "24:50", "thing that a lot of people are taking", "24:52", "for anti-aging and nad which is what we", "24:55", "were just talking about administered via", "24:56", "either in most cases it's IV there's a", "24:59", "couple companies doing like an oral nad", "25:01", "version but supposedly ma nmn I don't", "25:05", "know if Sinclair has any human studies", "25:07", "coming out on this right now but he or", "25:09", "or at least released but he's done", "25:11", "rodent studies and show mints like", "25:13", "exercise in a bottle mmm the NAD from", "25:16", "what I understand though and this", "25:17", "returns to the TBI concussion piece", "25:19", "crosses the blood-brain barrier easily", "25:22", "or more easily than nmn or NR so if you", "25:25", "were doing it for like a cognitive or a", "25:27", "neurological effect you may want to", "25:29", "choose nad sounds to me like from the", "25:31", "research I've seen if you were doing it", "25:32", "for the exercise effect maybe you choose", "25:34", "n MN or NR hmm interesting so me and I", "25:37", "aging effective a they don't even know", "25:40", "in many cases all the pathways on which", "25:43", "these things are working but most of", "25:45", "them are related to these certain", "25:46", "pathways where it like sirtuin", "25:48", "activating compounds that actually allow", "25:50", "your mitochondria to repair more quickly", "25:52", "or give your body more antioxidants so", "25:55", "the idea is they probably all have a", "25:57", "pretty good effect on anti-aging and", "25:58", "when you're doing it are you pushing", "26:01", "yourself you say you're doing it once a", "26:02", "week or you did it yourself are you", "26:04", "pushing it IV yeah and how much time to", "26:07", "yourself to actually do that yeah yeah", "26:09", "if I've got 20 minutes I'm happy like if", "26:12", "I have to compress in at 10 minutes it", "26:14", "hurts like I like to at least a lot for", "26:17", "20 minutes and then you follow it up in", "26:20", "most cases with like an IV cocktail like", "26:22", "a like a Meyers cocktail vitamin", "26:24", "cocktail and supposedly supposedly that", "26:27", "it does a few things supposedly it", "26:29", "enhances your stem cell mobilization or", "26:32", "the activity of stem cells and allows", "26:34", "the nd to be absorbed to the cells more", "26:35", "easily mmm so you basically I mean the", "26:38", "way I do it is I use it", "26:40", "just a butterfly needle and you do the", "26:42", "NAD administration and then you just", "26:43", "unscrew the the end of the butterfly", "26:46", "needle line and then you put the vitamin", "26:48", "cocktail and follow up with the vitamin", "26:50", "cocktail which takes like 30 to 60", "26:52", "seconds and then and why do you do it", "26:54", "once a week", "26:55", "you feel good no but why once a week why", "26:58", "not twice a week why the idea is you're", "27:00", "supposed to maintain your levels and", "27:01", "there's even some evidence and in it you", "27:03", "know this is kind of similar to", "27:04", "testosterone that long-term use may", "27:06", "suppress your body's own nad production", "27:08", "you're going to start to do it great but", "27:11", "you may want to realize that this is", "27:12", "something you'd need to do regularly I'm", "27:14", "going to keep your levels elevated", "27:16", "because you may get like a", "27:17", "down-regulation effect Oh interesting so", "27:19", "your body might recognize that it hasn't", "27:21", "a surplus that's not a lot of nad it", "27:24", "doesn't need to make more one of the one", "27:26", "of the very interesting things though I", "27:27", "did a couple of weeks ago as I went to", "27:30", "New York City and I got an ad from this", "27:33", "doctor dr. Chen over there but then he", "27:36", "infused me with Co Q 10 hmm and a bunch", "27:39", "of other vitamins to allow my body to", "27:42", "make more of what are called adult", "27:44", "pluripotent stem cells they're also", "27:46", "known as V cells very small embryonic", "27:49", "like cells now if you've heard of para", "27:52", "bios's before this idea of taking the", "27:55", "blood from young mice and transferring", "27:58", "that into old mice there was research", "28:00", "that they did at Stanford University on", "28:01", "this you impart essentially enhanced", "28:04", "longevity to the old mice the idea is", "28:07", "that's a that's a non Attalla ggest", "28:09", "transfer right like that's that that's", "28:10", "the transfer of blood from from a young", "28:13", "healthy

dollars this company called", "28:22", "ambrosia will will give you the plasma", "28:24", "from a young healthy donor is there any", "28:26", "evidence that that does anything good", "28:27", "for you though other than the studies", "28:29", "that they've done mice I don't know of", "28:31", "any studies on humans", "28:32", "yeah no is there anecdotal evidence", "28:34", "meaning people that you know of yeah I'm", "28:37", "about to to get into that you're gonna", "28:39", "saw but you haven't no I didn't", "28:42", "autologous version of that so I didn't", "28:43", "want to put somebody else's blood so we", "28:45", "didn't run body so what I did was I had", "28:47", "this doc take out a pint of my blood and", "28:49", "what happens is if you put all these", "28:51", "vitamins like nad and stuff into your", "28:53", "blood", "28:53", "it increases your stem cell production", "28:55", "if you stress the blood after that it", "28:58", "dumps out a bunch of these tiny little", "29:00", "adult pluripotent stem cells which is", "29:02", "exactly the same type of cell that", "29:05", "you're getting when you do one of these", "29:06", "young blood transfers so he stresses", "29:08", "that over night in cold you can use cold", "29:11", "you could use pressure you could use", "29:13", "anything to increase the stem cell", "29:14", "release from the blood cells but they", "29:16", "get stressed out they release stem cells", "29:18", "and then what happens is you get them", "29:20", "injected back into your body", "29:22", "so this is similar to like what they're", "29:24", "doing with Regina Kane I don't think", "29:26", "it's anything like that well you know", "29:27", "with John Keane they take the blood out", "29:29", "and they stress it with here and then", "29:30", "they spin it a few yeah and I think I", "29:33", "think and and I don't know a lot about", "29:36", "what Regina Keene is doing but I think", "29:38", "they're more concentrating the growth", "29:39", "factors I think they might be doing", "29:41", "exosomes I know they've got some", "29:43", "overseas places where they're doing like", "29:45", "a culture expanded or something like", "29:47", "that but as far as in the u.s. like this", "29:50", "this protocol is one of the few that I", "29:53", "know of where you could take your own", "29:54", "blood and get a lot of that same stuff", "29:56", "that you'd get from culture expanded or", "29:58", "from Parab iosys like using the blood of", "30:01", "somebody else and you get all these stem", "30:03", "cells released into

they're not transferring", "30:12", "the entire body's supply of know that", "30:14", "they're taking they're taking a bunch of", "30:16", "plasma I don't know the volume that", "30:18", "they're using in my case they took a", "30:19", "pint of my blood so for right 460cc", "30:22", "tubes now is there any anecdotal", "30:24", "evidence or any published evidence on", "30:26", "your style that

leading up to that and this", "45:00", "was I think this was like 2013 like this", "45:03", "was a while ago where they took mice and", "45:05", "they gave one group testosterone the", "45:09", "other group didn't get it and then they", "45:11", "spent six months off testosterone I", "45:14", "remember how long they were on it but", "45:16", "they spent six months off it and then", "45:17", "they took those mice and they trained", "45:18", "them with the training protocol and the", "45:20", "mice that were on the testosterone but", "45:22", "were no longer on it had a 30% increase", "45:25",

recently my", "77:47", "youngest daughter is obsessed with", "77:49", "fishing she fucking loves it and we", "77:52", "caught a bunch of yellowtail when we", "77:53", "were in Hawaii this last trip and now", "77:55", "she's super hooked cuz you know she's", "77:57", "eight and she's hanging on to this rod", "77:59", "and you know I mean I was sometimes I", "78:03", "was helping her like I was

not", "78:27", "supposed to eat them right you're", "78:28", "supposed to let them go it depends", "78:29", "there's a certain I forget that I forget", "78:32", "the color but there's a certain style of", "78:34", "steelhead that you are allowed to he had", "78:36", "to throw this one bag this wasn't the", "78:37", "one I don't I don't totally understand", "78:40", "that I mean I kind of understand it but", "78:42", "it seems to me like it is it's an ocean", "78:44", "bound rainbow trout correct yeah exactly", "78:47", "so why can't you eat I don't know I", "78:49", "don't know then and there's there's a", "78:51", "certain variety that you actually can't", "78:52", "eat well you you can eat it physically", "78:56", "but you know I mean I mean legally yeah", "78:58", "but that seems so strange to me is the", "79:01", "idea to protect the population because", "79:03", "they're in the process of breeding and", "79:05", "you don't wanna interrupt but you're not", "79:06", "there's a certain mortality rate that", "79:08", "they're accepting with catch and release", "79:10", "this is one of the reasons why I have an", "79:11", "issue with that and I've done catch and", "79:13", "release fishing I don't want to appear", "79:14", "like I'm a hypocrite cause it is fun but", "79:16", "there's a thing about it is like you're", "79:18", "just shoving a hook and in things face", "79:20", "yeah and then releasing them that's that", "79:22", "is why I like spear fishing because", "79:25", "you're underwater you're going after the", "79:28", "exact fish that you want yeah there's no", "79:30", "doubt in your mind I'm gonna shoot that", "79:32", "fish and you're not wondering what's", "79:34", "gonna bite the hook right like whether", "79:36", "it's gonna be a legal one mm-hmm or an", "79:38", "illigal one regardless of whether you", "79:41", "get a fish it's amazing you're happy you", "79:44", "see the coral you're getting you know", "79:46", "you're going down", "79:47", "and up there's there's all like if", "79:48", "you're in the fitness the cold", "79:50", "thermogenesis and the breath hold and", "79:52", "the spleen compression and the red blood", "79:53", "cell production so I mean it's it's an", "79:55", "amazing workout mm-hmm um it's just fun", "79:58", "it's a Zen", "79:59", "yeah they wouldn't let my daughter do it", "80:00", "though she's too young they said you", "80:02", "have to be 13", "80:03", "so Spearfish should tell you like", "80:06", "shallow water with a singing and that's", "80:08", "that's the way to do it is you want to", "80:10", "start offshore 8 to 15 feet of water you", "80:13", "want to easy sling you know a lot of", "80:16", "people think spear fishing and they", "80:17", "think of like the big roller guns that", "80:19", "you gotta like put the handle against", "80:21", "your chest and pull back right it's very", "80:23", "difficult and then you got a dive to", "80:26", "depths you know for if you're going", "80:27", "after tuna yeah I mean will it go like", "80:29", "30-plus feet and you have a floater and", "80:31", "it's a very involved process but if", "80:33", "you're just like in freakin Hawaii and", "80:35", "you've got a sling and a good spot and", "80:37", "some coral and some good fins and you", "80:40", "can just basically swim away mom you", "80:43", "know I'll tie a string around my waist", "80:45", "and put a little knife on my belt and", "80:47", "you can just go out there and you know", "80:49", "string four or five fish and it's an", "80:50", "easy day its

sunbathe", "93:16", "nude or you'd use one of these lights", "93:17", "and just stand in front like I literally", "93:19", "I look look like an idiot at work but", "93:20", "this is what I do I've got a light panel", "93:23", "in front of me right I'm at a standing", "93:26", "desk I work at a standing desk I've got", "93:27", "a light panel behind me and every day", "93:30", "for 20 minutes I just

and bitter", "93:50", "melon extract instead of metformin I'd", "93:52", "rather take the barren the bitter melon", "93:53", "extract so I think it just strips up", "93:56", "down and go as natural as

right", "94:30", "now it feels pretty good", "94:31", "the problem with sitting is that that is", "94:34", "the posture most people are adopting for", "94:36", "eight hours per day right the best",

you", "95:56", "believe in one of those have you seen", "95:58", "one of those it's a you stand at your", "96:01", "standing desk on this variable sort of", "96:04", "surface have you seen those things where", "96:06", "it's like a topographical Matt call the", "96:11", "topo the one like in our Boulder offices", "96:14", "for my company we've got the standup", "96:16", "desks that go up you
