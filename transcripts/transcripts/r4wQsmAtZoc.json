"many many many years so I really", "00:10", "appreciate you coming in well thank you", "00:12", "I appreciate that", "00:12", "like I was telling you I just started", "00:14", "your new book and how's it going it's", "00:16", "going well it's hasn't confusing shit", "00:18", "out of me yet but I know it's coming it", "00:20", "will be coming no doubt yeah with all", "00:22", "your work so the beginning of time the", "00:25", "beginning of the universe - the end", "00:28", "that's essentially what you're", "00:30", "summarizing yeah that's the that's the", "00:33", "backdrop to the entire narrative of the", "00:36", "book I I basically want the reader to", "00:38", "get a feel for the whole thing how it", "00:41", "started how things like you and me rise", "00:44", "up how consciousness emerges issues a", "00:47", "free will and whether we have it and", "00:49", "then on to the future what's going to", "00:51", "happen to us and the world and the", "00:53", "universe as time elapses to the far far", "00:56", "future it's uh I'm just getting to the", "01:00", "part where you're talking about how", "01:01", "entropy and evolution sort of commingle", "01:04", "to create life and when you think of", "01:07", "entropy a lot of people think of", "01:09", "something dissolving into chaos yeah", "01:11", "exactly but that's not necessarily the", "01:13", "case it's only part of the story I mean", "01:15", "entropy kind of gets a bad rap right", "01:17", "it's the thing that you want to avoid", "01:18", "but somehow the laws of physics don't", "01:20", "allow you to avoid it it's this", "01:22", "disintegration it's this decay it's this", "01:25", "drive toward disorder and that's kind of", "01:28", "true but the reality of the situation is", "01:30", "more subtle because overall entropy", "01:34", "needs to go up but that doesn't mean", "01:36", "there can't be little pockets of order", "01:38", "that form along the way and in fact the", "01:41", "universe is incredibly clever stars the", "01:44", "ubiquitous feature of the heavens they", "01:46", "are pockets of order that naturally form", "01:50", "but as they form they increase the", "01:52", "entropy in the surroundings so the net", "01:55", "entropy goes up even though this", "01:57", "beautiful orderly bright object in the", "02:00", "sky appears and it's only because of the", "02:03", "appearance of stars that the universe is", "02:05", "an interesting place without stars the", "02:08", "particles of the universe would just", "02:09", "disperse the universe would get bigger", "02:11", "and bigger colder and colder", "02:13", "and that would be it there wouldn't be", "02:15", "any structure in the universe if it", "02:16", "wasn't for the force of gravity stars", "02:18", "themselves just the fact that they exist", "02:20", "is very strange that you have this thing", "02:23", "and ours is fairly small right it's a", "02:25", "million times larger than Earth yeah and", "02:27", "it's going to burn for billions of years", "02:30", "and it's just hovering there yeah and it", "02:33", "creates all the life yeah literally is", "02:35", "responsible for all the life yeah and", "02:38", "when they supernova that creates the", "02:41", "actual ingredients for life which is", "02:44", "even more strange like you can't have", "02:45", "biological carbon-based life if it's not", "02:47", "for a star exploding yeah I mean we", "02:49", "often in a poetic way said that we are", "02:52", "made of star stuff", "02:53", "yeah that's Carl Sagan but you can also", "02:55", "say that we are are made of you know", "02:57", "nuclear refuse right we heard the news", "02:59", "right us yeah that that the death throes", "03:02", "of a star puts out into the universe and", "03:05", "it rains down on planets and at least on", "03:07", "one such planet that stuff comes", "03:09", "together and yields life so it is a", "03:11", "cycle I mean I don't want to sound like", "03:13", "The Lion King here but you know it", "03:15", "that's really what it is", "03:16", "well what I'm so interested in about in", "03:18", "getting into your book is the fact that", "03:20", "you are sort of detailing all these", "03:22", "steps that that have to take place in", "03:25", "order for all this life in order for", "03:26", "this universe to be what it is and then", "03:29", "where it's going to go yeah yeah exactly", "03:31", "and the remarkable thing and sort of", "03:35", "them the main point that some level is", "03:38", "that look we're special entities we can", "03:42", "think we can reflect we have emotions", "03:44", "but ultimately you and I and everybody", "03:46", "else were just bags of particles that", "03:49", "are governed by

that we're made of the same", "04:24", "stuff that makes up this bottle of water", "04:27", "or any of the wonderful little statues", "04:28", "you have on this desk because that means", "04:31", "that how remarkable that collections of", "04:35", "particles can do what we do mm-hmm and I", "04:37", "think that's really the way of looking", "04:40", "at the continuity we don't need to be",

can", "04:54", "draw from a more complete understanding", "04:57", "of where we came from and where we're", "04:58", "going that the fear of death and the", "05:01", "attitude of the finite life being", "05:04", "insignificant that like what is the", "05:06", "point this sort of existential angst", "05:08", "that many of us struggle with right yeah", "05:10", "right that's something that you touch", "05:12", "upon really early on that this this", "05:15", "thing that makes us unique is that we", "05:18", "know that we're gonna die yeah yeah that", "05:20", "that to me is the vital distinguishing", "05:24", "feature of our species you know we can", "05:27", "reflect on the past we can think about", "05:29", "the future and recognize that we're not", "05:32", "going to be here in

like to use a", "07:06", "metaphor to try to give you a feel for", "07:08", "the times involved I like to use the", "07:11", "Empire State Building and imagine that", "07:13", "every floor of the

here's here's", "08:00", "the thing the amazing thing obviously is", "08:03", "it sounds trite but time is relative", "08:05", "right so any duration that seems long", "08:07", "it's only long by

the", "09:29", "entire cosmic timeline so impossible to", "09:32", "understand the actual span of it because", "09:35", "it is so long but yet so small like yeah", "09:37", "in the human mind yeah it's very hard to", "09:41", "hold these durations yeah in mind I mean", "09:43", "I don't I don't feel like I've been", "09:46", "thinking about this stuff for a long", "09:47", "time I don't feel

like I mean Neil", "16:10", "deGrasse Tyson that because of their", "16:11", "personality because they're sort of", "16:13", "they're charismatic people it actually", "16:15", "makes more people

you know in the world", "16:38", "around us I mean the unfortunate thing", "16:40", "in the educational system is that we", "16:43", "teach toward examination we teach toward", "16:46", "assessment and if you want to figure out", "16:48", "how to flatten a kids interest in these", "16:51", "ideas just teach them stuff and tell", "16:53", "them you're going to be tested on this", "16:55", "on Tuesday you're gonna have to spit", "16:56", "that you know everything that you've", "16:58", "learned so I find it kind of", "17:00", "heartbreaking the way in which so much", "17:03", "intrinsic

to know enough", "17:50", "so I can you know do well on the quiz", "17:52", "and once the quiz is over they just sort", "17:54", "of leave the ideas behind when do these", "17:57", "ideas become

six years old I was", "18:09", "just captivated by mathematics really", "18:11", "yeah five or six definitely yeah my dad", "18:14", "my dad was not an academic my dad was a", "18:17", "composer he

you're doing any work", "26:23", "whatsoever the day to day the moment to", "26:26", "moment is a grind you know I don't know", "26:30", "how you find it in the work that you're", "26:32", "doing but

that", "27:01", "you do is a grind so so I think that's", "27:03", "ultimately what is the driver of", "27:07", "whatever you're doing in your life the", "27:09", "moment-to-moment", "27:10", "but yeah there is certainly a part of me", "27:12", "that would have a desire a hope that the", "27:19", "work would reverberate in a powerful way", "27:23", "I think that's true for most physicists", "27:25", "that that notion that you can sort of", "27:28", "sit at a table and think and change the", "27:32", "way we understand reality the way", "27:34", "Einstein did the way Schrodinger did the", "27:36", "way Niels Bohr did but like what", "27:38", "percentage of people you have that", "27:40", "revelation yeah I think it's I think", "27:42", "it's pretty few and far between nobody", "27:46", "else is sort of just contributing", "27:47", "contributing and usually someone exactly", "27:51", "some light bulb goes off sort of", "27:52", "powerful new inside and you're like okay", "27:54", "everything has suddenly changed that's", "27:57", "so exciting though and it's what keeps", "27:59", "going it keeps you going you know to be", "28:02", "the person who has the light bulb yeah", "28:04", "but I tell my students you know and", "28:06", "especially young students who come and", "28:08", "are still trying to figure out what they", "28:10", "want to do if you're not satisfied

the", "28:24", "field for you because it's so unlikely", "28:28", "because it's not just brainpower it's", "28:30", "thinking of the right questions it's", "28:33", "thinking of things in the right",

"28:43", "even fully under your control it's not", "28:46", "sort of a matter of you know exercising", "28:48", "your mind", "28:49", "and and building up the muscles of the", "28:51", "brain in such

you happen to see the", "29:02", "way forward that's it's so interesting", "29:05", "to me that there's so many people", "29:07", "working on all this stuff and the", "29:08", "average person that doesn't contemplate", "29:11", "quantum physics or these equations we", "29:15", "have no idea it's going on", "29:16", "yeah and that this all this work that's", "29:19", "so critical to our

they're reaping the", "29:30", "residual benefits of it yeah but they're", "29:32", "just wandering around not knowing yeah", "29:35", "hugely so in fact there's a number", "29:37", "that's quoted that quantum mechanics is", "29:40", "responsible for something like 35", "29:42", "percent of the gross national product so", "29:45", "so it's like it's in a very concrete way", "29:47", "now the the problem of that number is I", "29:49", "recently looked it up to find the source", "29:51", "of it so I sort of went online and", "29:53", "checked it out and apparently I'm the", "29:55", "source of this number and I assure you", "29:57", "that I've not done a calculation that", "29:59", "really fully justifies this but roughly", "30:01", "speaking you know anything that has an", "30:03", "integrated circuit is the result a", "30:07", "beneficiary of quantum insights so we", "30:10", "use this stuff every moment of our", "30:13", "technological lives and yet as you say", "30:16", "for the most part most of us don't have", "30:18", "a deep understanding of the reality", "30:21", "that's responsible for the gadgetry that", "30:24", "the sign says has given rise to and it's", "30:28", "a strange quantum mechanics is an", "30:30", "utterly strange reality too strange yeah", "30:34", "I I've tried many many times to try to", "30:37", "understand right whether it's Sean", "30:38", "Carroll's books", "30:39", "yeah or yours or any anyone's yeah it's", "30:42", "just it doesn't get in right and again", "30:44", "it goes back to you know our brains just", "30:47", "weren't under pressure to thing quantum", "30:48", "mechanically but I assure you you give", "30:52", "me a couple hours I mean books are one", "30:55", "thing because it's a one-sided", "30:57", "conversation but you give me a couple", "30:59", "hours in a back and forth and I will", "31:01", "absolutely get you to", "31:02", "place where you appreciate and have a", "31:05", "sense of what these ideas really are", "31:08", "telling us about the nature of the world", "31:09", "here's the thing that I've always wanted", "31:11", "to ask someone like you what do you", "31:13", "think was happening before the Big Bang", "31:15", "yeah it's a it's a it's a deep question", "31:19", "and a subtle one and there's sort of two", "31:22", "ways that I'd like to think about that", "31:24", "question one is it could be that the Big", "31:28", "Bang was an interesting event but not", "31:31", "the first event in the totality of", "31:35", "reality it could have been the first", "31:37", "event that sparked the expansion of our", "31:39", "part of space but it could be that", "31:41", "there's a grander realm of space within", "31:43", "which we sit as a small part and that", "31:46", "grander realm may have been here for a", "31:48", "far longer period of time it may have", "31:50", "experienced its own big bang's may be a", "31:53", "collection of big bangs that may extend", "31:55", "infinitely far into the past so it could", "31:58", "be that the answer to the question of", "32:00", "what happened before the Big Bang is a", "32:01", "lot of other big bangs or a lot of other", "32:04", "quantum events that were taking place in", "32:06", "a larger landscape of reality then we", "32:08", "have direct access to however another", "32:11", "answer is that the very question may not", "32:14", "make as much sense as the words seem to", "32:17", "suggest we know how to parse that", "32:19", "sentence we know what it means to talk", "32:20", "about the moment before the Big Bang", "32:22", "because we know how to talk about the", "32:24", "moment before your birth or the moment", "32:26", "before the Civil War or the moment", "32:27", "before any event that happened the world", "32:29", "we fully understand the meaning of that", "32:30", "kind of sentence but it could be that", "32:33", "when it comes to the Big Bang the", "32:35", "sentence actually doesn't mean anything", "32:37", "it could be that the Big Bang was the", "32:40", "place where time itself started and", "32:43", "Hawking himself had a wonderful analogy", "32:45", "to get this across he said look I'll", "32:48", "dress it up a little bit imagine you're", "32:49", "walking on planet Earth in you pass by", "32:51", "someone you say hey can you point me in", "32:53", "the direction of North I want to walk in", "32:55", "the northward direction the point you", "32:57", "continue to walk you pass by somebody", "32:58", "else a hey which way is further north", "33:00", "and they point you in that direction but", "33:02", "when you get to the North Pole and talk", "33:04", "to somebody there and say hey how do I", "33:06", "go further north they look at you and", "33:08", "say whoa that question doesn't mean", "33:10", "anything because this is where north", "33:13", "begin", "33:13", "there's no notion of going further north", "33:16", "than the North Pole and it could be that", "33:18", "that spatial metaphor applies to time", "33:21", "talk about a billion years ago ten", "33:23", "billion years ago but if you go to 13.8", "33:26", "billion years ago the Big Bang that may", "33:28", "be where time started and you can't go", "33:31", "further back in time than the very", "33:33", "origin of time itself that freaks me out", "33:36", "yeah see that that's one that it gets in", "33:39", "your head you know what do you mean", "33:40", "beginning of time yeah", "33:42", "why would time have a beginning good and", "33:45", "it could be it could be the time is an", "33:49", "emergent quality of reality I give you", "33:53", "an analogy boy what I mean by that is we", "33:55", "all know what temperature means", "33:58", "intuitively something's hot you feel it", "34:00", "something is called you feel it your", "34:01", "body understands those concepts what", "34:04", "physics has done is it's gone deeper", "34:05", "into the concept of temperature and", "34:07", "revealed that it is nothing but the", "34:10", "average motion of the particles making", "34:13", "up the environment so if the molecules", "34:15", "are moving really quickly you've got a", "34:17",

"34:54", "arranged in the right patterns but", "34:57", "fundamentally maybe there are atoms or", "35:00", "molecules of time which when not", "35:03", "arranged in the form that we are", "35:04",

"Big Bang yeah why would something's", "35:30", "smaller than the head of a pin", "35:32", "yeah become everything that we see in", "35:33", "the cosmos yeah so there are ideas for", "35:36", "the answer to that question look all", "35:38", "this is tentative because it's very hard", "35:40", "to do measurements that go all the way", "35:42", "back to the beginning we have", "35:44",

some videos", "48:37", "online and I see her on like the Merv", "48:38", "Griffin Show where you know she she", "48:41", "channels Ramtha", "48:42", "on live television I know what year this", "48:44", "was you know she snaps her head forward", "48:46", "it goes", "48:47", "she changes her voice it becomes like", "48:49", "something between the Queen and Yoda you", "48:51", "know great weird plays though you know", "48:54", "hello peeing and she's talking to Merv", "48:56", "Griffin you know he's talking about like", "48:58", "an air punch goes what does airplane you", "49:00",

"with their arms out like this and I'm", "49:11", "like like can they see your and I get", "49:13", "closer they're all blindfolded and I'm", "49:15", "saying that what what is going on here", "49:17", "and they described that each person has", "49:19", "a card around their neck where they've", "49:21", "written down their life's dream and an", "49:23", "exact copy of that card has been put out", "49:26", "on this big field and they have to feel", "49:29", "their way toward the matching card and", "49:32", "if they succeed this shows that this", "49:34", "goal or desire is gonna come to pass oh", "49:38", "boy you know and I'm saying to these", "49:39", "guys like so how's it going he goes like", "49:42", "really good you know one person found", "49:44", "their card you know in the last few", "49:45", "minutes like you know the odds of", "49:47", "probability of that happening you're", "49:49", "kind of not unreasonable but that's all", "49:51", "that this is and then they take me to", "49:53", "the blindfolded archers oh geez yeah you", "49:57", "know so they're taking bow and arrow and", "49:59", "they're firing at these targets and like", "50:02", "men I'm like standing way back on this", "50:04", "kind of thing and they ask me you know", "50:06", "do you want to try it and I was like you", "50:08", "know there's a photographer that's come", "50:09", "along I'm like no I'll avoid that and", "50:11", "then they introduced me to this woman", "50:13", "who is able to predict the next card in", "50:18", "a shuffled deck and you know so she'd", "50:20", "pull out this card and she'd say okay", "50:22", "it's gonna be seven of clubs and it's", "50:24", "like a three of spades and then the next", "50:26", "one is a seven of diamonds because oh", "50:27", "well there's the seven that I was", "50:28", "talking about you know one card before", "50:30", "you know so is this crazy circumstance", "50:34", "where and then I go I go to give my talk", "50:36", "okay because that's why I was there", "50:38", "after all this was just like the", "50:39", "preamble they were showing me what they", "50:41", "do I walk into this barn and III across", "50:45", "the threshold a barn and they all give", "50:46", "me a standing ovation and I'm like okay", "50:49", "I appreciate it but like why are you", "50:52", "giving me a standing ovation and I go", "50:54", "and I start to give my talk and I and I", "50:56", "say to them straight out", "50:57", "what I've seen here is nuts okay you", "51:02", "know I say you know if you're gonna try", "51:04", "to predict next cards in the deck you", "51:06", "know one average four times you'll get", "51:08", "the suit whenever 13 times they get the", "51:11", "rank there's nothing in there but the", "51:12", "pure probabilistic laws of mathematics", "51:15", "you know they rise up and give me a", "51:18", "standing ovation and I say it's", "51:21", "appreciated but why are you applauding", "51:24", "I'm telling you that you're wasting your", "51:25", "time and they applaud me again and I'm", "51:29", "like this is like so totally weird but", "51:31", "then I go to the book signing I finished", "51:33", "my talk in the book signing these people", "51:35", "they conferred mean they they talk to us", "51:37", "off they say there's a lot of crazy", "51:39", "stuff that's happening in this place but", "51:42", "we come here because we feel that", "51:44", "there's something else in the world and", "51:46", "we want to be around like-minded", "51:48", "individuals that are searching for the", "51:50", "deeper truth so thank you for calling", "51:52", "out the silliness that's happening here", "51:53", "but we'll come here anyway and spend our", "51:55", "money because we want to be part of the", "51:57", "journey and I have to tell you I had a", "51:59", "degree of sympathy for them because I", "52:03", "get the motivation I mean as a physicist", "52:07", "what we do is we are revealing

never", "52:19", "take you closer to the truth however", "52:22", "much you may feel that you're among", "52:23", "like-minded individuals so I get the", "52:25", "motivation I get this sensation I get", "52:27", "the urge", "52:28", "but it's tragic that these individuals", "52:31", "feel that this kind of an undertaking is", "52:33", "a pathway that will take them toward the", "52:36", "deeper

"they're quite litigious aren't ya no", "52:55", "they definitely are you know so so", "52:57", "anyway there's just a one person's", "52:59", "opinion you know they take me to the", "53:01", "mansion

"53:20", "thank you it was like this big emotional", "53:24", "thing and I was like I I don't I don't", "53:26", "get it but I think that's the way that", "53:28", "she brings people in to the fold

there was a friend of mine at", "55:22", "the Comedy Store had a fur", "55:23", "and that I don't know her name but she", "55:25", "came to the comedy store and she was so", "55:28", "happy and I'm like she was like I'm so", "55:31", "happy why he's so happy she goes because", "55:33", "I found the secret and now that I know", "55:35", "about the secret I am going to be", "55:38", "married I am going to be this I'm going", "55:40", "to I'm going to have this fulfilled life", "55:42", "I'm going to reach my dreams and I'm", "55:44", "really excited about that so you know at", "55:48", "the time I had just seen the movie and", "55:49", "then I was just starting to understand", "55:50", "the criticism of the movie I was reading", "55:53", "all these you know healthcare where", "55:55", "scientists were breaking down all the", "55:57", "things that were wrong and and I know I", "55:59", "didn't - her dreams I just was like wow", "56:02", "okay and then I saw a year later outside", "56:05", "of another one of my shows a different", "56:07", "comedy club and I said hey how you doing", "56:09", "just like things are just not going the", "56:12", "way I thought I thought because of the", "56:14", "secret that everything would be great", "56:15", "but my dad is still a pain in the ass", "56:17", "and you know and that he always moved in", "56:19", "with me doesn't have any money and I", "56:21", "think I can't establish a good", "56:23", "relationship but I don't have the job", "56:24", "that I wanted I don't understand because", "56:26", "I've been using the secret I think about", "56:28", "it every day right and I said here's my", "56:30", "take on this if you talk to someone", "56:33", "who's very successful and you say to", "56:36", "them hey how did you get very successful", "56:40", "and they say I thought about it all the", "56:42", "time I have a vision board I took that", "56:44", "photo of the house that I wanted I put", "56:46", "it in the vision board that became my", "56:47", "house I took you know this this idea I", "56:50", "want a beautiful wife I want a family I", "56:52", "want sports cars and this and that and", "56:54", "now I have those things because the mind", "56:56", "is a powerful tool and the mind can", "56:59", "create reality the you're just talking", "57:01", "to someone who is successful how many", "57:05", "people thought like that and nothing", "57:06", "happened right", "57:07", "I bet Millions yeah I bet there's so", "57:09", "many but you're you have a that you have", "57:12", "a bias in successful users your those", "57:16", "are the ones you're talking to and just", "57:18", "because of the fact that they've been", "57:19", "able to have his extraordinarily", "57:21", "successful successful lives while",

act", "57:31", "and you have to do right in this trial", "57:33", "and error and there's a lot of lessons", "57:34", "to be learned but if you wanted to", "57:35", "simplify it at the end", "57:37",

"there's nothing wrong with visualizing", "57:48", "success but that is not the causal", "57:53", "ingredient right that will yield the", "57:55", "success and the thing that comes to mind", "57:56", "is you know I don't know if they do it", "57:58", "any longer but there was certainly a", "57:59", "time when Olympic athletes would be", "58:01", "taught to visualize say jumping over", "58:04",

"training that integrated this", "58:14", "visualization as part of the training", "58:17", "program yeah you know so so so it's kind", "58:20", "of tragic when people buy into these", "58:22", "these crazy ideas and I have to tell you", "58:25", "when they were making that film they", "58:27", "called me to be in it and I think was", "58:29", "the director one of the producers I was", "58:31", "on the phone with and you know they were", "58:34", "describing what they were doing and I", "58:36", "probed sufficiently hard and some of my", "58:38", "friends did not probe sufficiently", "58:39",

"sounds like a really bad thing to be", "58:49", "doing and they took offense in that call", "58:52", "back then a year after the film came out", "58:55", "it was either the director producer I", "58:57", "can't remember the gentleman's name", "58:58", "called me up and said I want to", "59:00", "apologize to you you were absolutely", "59:02", "right", "59:02", "I have finally realized what a bad film", "59:05", "this was to be involved in and I", "59:08", "completely regret it", "59:10", "so that I don't think is the point of", "59:12", "view of of you know the romp the school", "59:15", "of enlightenment which is behind this or", "59:17", "at least part of what was behind this", "59:19", "but at least the director or the", "59:21", "producer ever was saw the light and", "59:23", "realized that this is not the kind of", "59:25", "information that you want to put out in", "59:27", "the world because it can change people's", "59:29", "lives in a very negative way you know I", "59:31", "think your comparison to Olympic", "59:33", "athletes is is very good because the", "59:37", "Olympic athletes are visualizing", "59:38", "something that they already do you know", "59:41",

failures of your", "59:53", "process how you're going to adjust on", "59:56", "the fly all those things are great", "59:58", "because then when things do take place", "60:00", "in real-life situations you've already", "60:02", "prepared for them you know the path", "60:03", "right that right that's all about I", "60:05", "agree that and in fact I have to tell", "60:07", "you know in one of the chapters later", "60:09", "chapters in the book I describe theories", "60:12", "about why it is that we for instance", "60:14", "tell fictional stories I mean could", "60:18", "there be any evolutionary value in two", "60:21", "individuals telling each other a story", "60:23", "that they both know is false that they", "60:25", "know has no connection to the world", "60:27", "around them but yet we've been doing", "60:29", "that since the emergence of language and", "60:33", "there are these interesting evolutionary", "60:35", "scenarios in which what you're saying is", "60:38", "brought to bear in that unfamiliar", "60:40", "context we tell stories because it's the", "60:43", "minds way of rehearsing for the real", "60:45", "world but it's a way of rehearsing for", "60:47",

"is yeah the only thing that I would say", "61:38", "contrary to that is some people develop", "61:41", "expectations based on fictional accounts", "61:44", "yeah and there's a real problem like", "61:45", "romantic movies where some people will", "61:49", "expect behavior that exists in these", "61:52", "romantic movies only right and it's not", "61:55", "indicative of human beings in the real", "61:57", "world yeah yeah I point well-taken I", "62:00", "mean I think the vital thing is that", "62:02", "your brain has had sufficient experience", "62:06", "that it can wait these fictional", "62:09", "accounts in a way that can enhance your", "62:11", "response to the world but not set undue", "62:13", "expectations of things that are just you", "62:15", "know only going to be true at a", "62:17", "fictional setting and not in the real", "62:18", "world it's just so strange to me that we", "62:20", "desire those I mean here are movies", "62:22", "right yeah like hero movies in", "62:24", "particular especially superhero movies", "62:26", "someone who possesses powers beyond", "62:30", "anything known to human beings or any", "62:33", "life-form yeah I get that yeah I mean", "62:36", "I'm sure you love to just snap your", "62:37", "fingers it fix everything but I actually", "62:39", "see it in a slightly different way", "62:41", "relevant to what we're talking about", "62:43", "before you know I think that the whole", "62:45", "hero worship that we have as a culture", "62:48", "mm-hmm comes again from our recognition", "62:52", "of how powerless we are against the", "62:55", "forces of nature against the inevitable", "62:57", "death that is facing us all and", "63:00", "therefore there's something deeply", "63:02", "seductive about the possibility

we do them in", "63:18", "the manner that we do when encountering", "63:20", "a hero in the world I mean there's you", "63:23", "know you know Joseph Campbell yeah yeah", "63:25", "you know so you know the power of myth", "63:27", "but is more technical version to here", "63:29", "with a thousand faces you know he goes", "63:31", "through the the whole notion of what it", "63:35", "is to have a myth and it's basically an", "63:36", "individual it's call to action to rise", "63:39", "above the kinds of activities that mere", "63:42", "mortals will be able to undertake resist", "63:44", "the call at first but then Rises the", "63:47", "challenge goes out into the world", "63:49", "conquers comes back a changed individual", "63:52", "and shakes up the reality from which", "63:54", "that individual initially emerged on", "63:56", "this journey and there is ample evidence", "63:59", "that across cultures throughout the ages", "64:02", "we have constantly been telling these", "64:05", "kinds of mythological tales because they", "64:07", "speak to us they speak to our urge and", "64:10", "our desire to transcend the limitations", "64:12", "that our physical form and the laws of", "64:14", "physics", "64:15", "necessarily constrain us to yeah it's it", "64:18", "is fascinating when you think of how", "64:20", "many different languages and how many", "64:21", "different cultures share those same", "64:23", "archetypal themes yeah yeah and I do", "64:26", "think it all comes if you look way back", "64:30", "into the history of the ideas it comes", "64:33", "from this initial recognition that we", "64:38", "are mortal and the fact that our brains", "64:41", "are able to not just fix on the moment", "64:44", "but can think about the entire timeline", "64:47", "is the one that makes that a poignant", "64:49", "realization and if we couldn't think", "64:51", "about the future who would what would it", "64:52", "matter if we knew that we were going to", "64:54", "die I

allows us to build the pyramids", "65:05", "that allows us to come up with quantum", "65:07", "mechanics and Einstein's equations and", "65:09", "Beethoven symphony and and Picasso's", "65:11", "work the fact that we can undertake all", "65:13", "of these expressions of creative will", "65:16", "and the desire to transcend the world", "65:19", "around us has a downside and the", "65:22", "downside is we recognize that we are not", "65:24", "going to be here for very long and I", "65:27", "think that motivates a certain kind of", "65:29", "engagement with the world and hero", "65:31", "worship is part of it", "65:33", "Kurzweil is a fascinating character yeah", "65:36", "he thinks he's going to be around", "65:37", "forever yeah I was wrapping him up yeah", "65:39", "have you discussed any of this stuff", "65:41", "with him you know I don't know him", "65:43", "personally I have certainly gone to some", "65:45", "of his talks and I think he and I had", "65:47", "one exchange at some point in the past", "65:49", "and I totally get where he's coming from", "65:53", "you know he feels that we're perhaps the", "65:57", "final mortal generation and how sad it", "66:00", "is after you know a hundred thousand", "66:04", "generations of humans if we could only", "66:06", "stick around for one more generation", "66:08", "science would come to a point where we", "66:11", "would be

think is", "66:33", "wishful thinking this is a strange", "66:35", "concept of immortality - because it's", "66:37", "not necessarily you it's a downloaded", "66:40", "version of you that will exist in some", "66:42", "sort of computer right which is what", "66:45", "does that mean right that sounds like", "66:47", "hell yeah it could be yeah you know", "66:51", "harem sleep in computers well I allow", "66:53", "for the possibility that that maybe it", "66:56", "would be a way of being in the world", "66:58", "that would have upsides that are hard", "67:01", "for us as flesh-and-blood individuals to", "67:03", "appreciation or at this point but it", "67:07", "raises the deep question would that be a", "67:10", "good thing in fact if you had that", "67:11", "opportunity to be

I've had some pretty profound", "67:34", "psychedelic experiences and then from", "67:37", "then I said I'm gonna hedge my bets let", "67:39", "me see what's next right let's see what", "67:41", "happens when the lights go out oh really", "67:42", "do you think there may be something that", "67:44", "happens when the lights go out I don't", "67:45", "know yeah I don't know what I mean for", "67:48", "sure your body is going to decay and you", "67:51", "are going to become a part of the earth", "67:53", "you're becoming part unless they cremate", "67:55", "you or unless they write embalm you with", "67:57", "some toxic chemicals then nothing can", "67:59", "use your your dead tissue which is", "68:00", "really a shame yeah it's really shame", "68:02", "that we do that right yeah I

think", "68:12", "consciousness is I think consciousness", "68:14", "is clearly just a factor of brain tissue", "68:18", "and an energy or do you think it's", "68:22", "possible that what our brain is is", "68:26", "something that tunes into consciousness", "68:28", "yeah well I spend I spent some time", "68:31", "thinking about this question I think", "68:33", "it's perhaps the deepest question that", "68:35", "faces science or even humanity at some", "68:38", "level and my own personal", "68:41", "active is that consciousness is nothing", "68:44", "more than the choreographed motion of",

that first night so the next night", "78:23", "when we went I went right to the bottom", "78:25", "of the list where there was something it", "78:28", "was in Dutch or something but it had", "78:29",

"either but uh we were in a club we're in", "78:44", "a club and all of a sudden the world", "78:46", "changed and what started happening is my", "78:51", "brain started manufacturing versions of", "78:55", "myself that would converse with me and", "78:58", "convinced me that the reality that I was", "79:01", "experiencing was real and then that", "79:03", "version of me would destroy that

the impact was because my body has", "79:17", "no experience oh for sure you know and", "79:20", "and so I think that just enhanced the", "79:21", "the impact and you know it was", "79:26", "terrifying it was utterly I was in the", "79:29", "hotel room and I was clinging to the bed", "79:32", "and and I actually said to my wife tie", "79:37", "me up not not on any night it sounds", "79:40", "wrong I mean I mean time it cuz I'm like", "79:42", "terrified of what I'm gonna do right you", "79:45", "know wow you know and so instead you", "79:48", "know she she called the doctor and I was", "79:50", "like", "79:50", "she was like afraid this would be like", "79:52", "in the newspaper because I just like you", "79:53", "have left you to the Queen you know but", "79:55", "you know they're so used to Americans", "79:57", "getting in over their head with this", "79:59", "kind of experience is something that", "80:01", "they were completely used to so no they", "80:03", "did they sent up a doctor and the doctor", "80:05", "basically just gives you sugar and my", "80:08", "wife knew that this was a an extreme", "80:11", "circumstance room because I don't eat", "80:12", "any sugar but I was like he said eat is", "80:15", "my I was like taking the Milky Way bars", "80:16", "like a sheet or somehow or another sugar", "80:18", "or something I don't know I don't know", "80:19", "the chemistry behind this but but sugar", "80:22", "is the the antidote caffeine is supposed", "80:24", "to help tapping it help - yeah I guess", "80:26", "but it lasted eight hours even

to", "80:39", "Beatles peripheral Ike for like seven", "80:41", "hours and I was just you know in this in", "80:43", "this place that I had never experienced", "80:45", "before now now you know for our", "80:47", "conversation you know this just made it", "80:50", "so intuitively obvious to me that my", "80:53", "conscious awareness is totally dependent", "80:57", "on time on account a few chemicals", "80:59", "that's all that's happening inside of", "81:01", "the head so in a way it was a valuable", "81:03", "experience it's not something that I", "81:05", "want to ever experience

"because what you took was by most", "81:30", "people's idea of very mild yeah", "81:32", "but profound psychedelic chemicals that", "81:34", "are also produced by your brain if you", "81:36", "just shift that ratio and not by too", "81:39", "much really you're not talking about it", "81:41", "even you talking about little small", "81:43", "doses of this stuff shift that ratio it", "81:46", "produces these profound visions it's", "81:48", "just like ayahuasca type is just an", "81:51", "orally active version of", "81:53", "dimethyltryptamine okay they've figured", "81:54", "out how to you know your brain print", "81:56", "your gut rather produces mono Amin", "81:58", "oxidase and it breaks down", "81:59", "dimethyltryptamine and so they figured", "82:01", "out how to combine an mao and", "82:04", "with the leaves of another plant that", "82:06", "has the dimethyltryptamine and I say but", "82:08", "you could take it there's synthetic", "82:10", "versions of it but the point is this is", "82:12", "something that your brain produces your", "82:14", "liver produces we know you we know it's", "82:16", "produced in the lung since the body", "82:17", "makes it yeah right but it's got it's in", "82:19", "there let me change the shift balance", "82:22", "and also you have these incredibly", "82:23", "profound visions yeah it makes you think", "82:25", "like what what we have now in terms of", "82:30", "our balance and our chemicals must be", "82:32", "different than what this fella must have", "82:35", "had yes chimpanzee thing right and and", "82:38", "primates before that as the human like", "82:41", "when you think of human evolution do you", "82:44", "ever stop to think what are we going to", "82:47", "be like a million years from now if we", "82:48", "do survive what have you ever done this", "82:51", "sort of thought experiment we say okay", "82:53", "if things keep going the same way right", "82:55", "we used to be very strong and very hairy", "82:58", "and we're getting you know progressively", "83:00", "softer as we don't need to use our", "83:03", "bodies as much our brains are getting", "83:05", "larger our heads are getting bigger do", "83:06", "you do that sort of thought experiment", "83:08", "to see what we're gonna become and not", "83:10", "in a systematic scientific way because", "83:12", "the process is so fraught with", "83:16", "incredible detail that I think it's hard", "83:18", "for anybody even experts in evolutionary", "83:20", "biology to really tell us anything that", "83:22", "will hold water that's really predictive", "83:25", "but on a general level yeah I mean", "83:28", "because I you know people often wonder", "83:29", "why is it that we haven't been visited", "83:33", "by aliens right this is a thing that", "83:35", "comes up whenever you're talking about", "83:36", "other life inside the universe of that", "83:39", "in a minute yeah yeah yeah but but but", "83:41", "the answer to that could be quite", "83:43", "straightforward nobody out there cares", "83:45", "about us because we're so ill developed", "83:48", "we're so young on the cosmic scene that", "83:51", "there's nothing interesting for them to", "83:53", "find here on planet earth so to me", "83:56", "there's a natural explanation for why", "83:58", "there can be stuff out of their life out", "84:00", "there and yet they don't hang out around", "84:02", "planet Earth it's just we don't hang", "84:03", "around an anthill to try to have a", "84:05", "conversation with you know what's going", "84:06", "on inside

moles we're we're into", "84:17", "you're interested in in whorls we're", "84:19", "interested in them for very specific", "84:20", "reasons alright so typically we're", "84:22", "interested either because we want to see", "84:25", "the evolutionary development that yields", "84:26", "this particular life form or because", "84:29", "there's a general curiosity about how", "84:31", "this object is put together if these", "84:34", "other beings are so far beyond us that", "84:37", "those kinds of taxon and attacks on", "84:39", "amines are no longer of any interest", "84:41", "then hanging around here may not hold", "84:44", "anything for them to make the journey", "84:47", "and stick around long enough for us to", "84:49", "notice I don't buy that again for two", "84:51", "reasons one because why would we assume", "84:53", "that they're so far beyond us that they", "84:56", "wouldn't be interested in these talking", "84:58", "monkeys with thermonuclear weapons who", "85:00",

"everyone gets video through the sky if", "85:11", "they fly in metal tubes that hurl over", "85:14", "the stove ER the oceans right it pollute", "85:16", "the oceans and eat all the fish like", "85:18", "these people are fucking crazy yeah", "85:19", "we've got to go there and check this out", "85:21", "but but imagine that this civilization", "85:23", "the notion of lording over a planet is", "85:26", "like us talking about you know the ant", "85:29", "law during over a grain of sand so they", "85:31", "may be galactic as opposed to planetary", "85:35", "in their hegemony and the

kind of pole", "85:49", "that you imagined that it does how I", "85:52", "disagree we think it's interesting when", "85:54", "we see a chimp use a rock to open up a", "85:56", "nut you know we think it's interesting", "85:58", "that you know there's there's a an", "86:00", "amazing photograph of an orangutan", "86:02", "that's spearfishing have you ever seen", "86:03", "it I have seen that actually yeah yeah", "86:05", "right no it is he learned it from people", "86:07", "apparently but it's still interesting", "86:09", "nonetheless right but I don't think a", "86:11", "hundred years from now we're gonna be as", "86:12", "interested in these kind of qualities or", "86:14", "a thousand years from now or ten", "86:16", "thousand years from well so we assumed", "86:18", "that these things that come here from", "86:20", "another planet are more than ten", "86:22", "thousand years well that's because", "86:23", "that's that's a very good question and I", "86:24", "think the answer to that is we look at", "86:27", "the history of the cosmos until today", "86:30", "and it's say let's just call it our", "86:32", "universe to be concrete 13.8 billion", "86:34", "years and we look at life on planet", "86:38", "Earth and it you know a handful of", "86:39", "billions of years old so and a handful", "86:42", "of billions of years you can go from", "86:44", "some complex molecules to human beings", "86:47", "let's say you say it like it's not that", "86:48", "long it was it was it's not that long", "86:50", "because you know imagine that life began", "86:53", "a few billion years earlier in some", "86:56", "other system you know stars and galaxies", "87:00", "they were starting up you know a billion", "87:02", "years after the Big Bang so it could be", "87:04", "that life in other worlds has a", "87:07", "headstart on us by a few billion years", "87:10", "and we know what can happen in a few", "87:12", "billion years it can days from", "87:13", "single-cell to us and you can imagine", "87:15", "from a few billion years from now into", "87:17", "the future it could be radically", "87:18", "different so to say it's ten thousand", "87:22", "years ahead of us that to me would be", "87:23", "the unexplained coincidence how unlikely", "87:27", "that they started we started with them", "87:29", "ten thousand years in the span of", "87:32", "billions of years that seems unlikely it", "87:35", "is it doesn't seem unlikely when you're", "87:36", "talking about the infinite size of the", "87:38", "universe and this perhaps an infinite", "87:41", "number of Brian green show up there", "87:42", "talking to an infinite numbers of me", "87:44", "good good point good point so so you're", "87:46", "absolutely right", "87:46", "we're almost guaranteed if the spatial", "87:50", "expanse of the universe is influenced as", "87:51", "there are going to be places where it's", "87:53", "within ten thousand years or more but", "87:55", "those are going to be a very small", "87:57", "number compared to the places where it's", "87:59", "not ten thousand true or would it be an", "88:02", "infinite number of them well but there", "88:05", "are different kinds of infinity so you", "88:06", "mean in this space the exact scope of", "88:09", "the universe itself a small number", "88:10", "relatively speaking to where we are yes", "88:12", "well I would say slightly differently", "88:13", "I'd say look at a finite size ball in", "88:16", "this large space okay so everything's", "88:18", "finite let's get a five billion light", "88:21", "year all right and within that ball the", "88:24", "number that are differing from us by ten", "88:26", "thousand years would be very very small", "88:28", "compared to the number differing from us", "88:30", "by say a billion years or a couple of", "88:33", "billion years so this simply by the law", "88:35", "of numbers if we imagine that they're", "88:37", "random processes that are eternal now", "88:39", "there could be some physical principle", "88:41", "that per", "88:42", "Vence life from emerging before say four", "88:45", "billion years ago", "88:46", "hmm and if that's the case and we're not", "88:48", "aware of that principle then you'd be", "88:50", "absolutely right that we'd all be", "88:51", "roughly at the same starting point and", "88:53", "there's no reason to suspect that they", "88:55", "would be so far ahead of us", "88:57", "but I don't know of any such principle", "88:59", "but yeah yeah you almost have a", "89:01", "reductionist view of this right like you", "89:03", "did you so if you had a guess if you had", "89:05", "a hundred dollars to bet has alien life", "89:09", "ever observed us you would say no well", "89:11", "by observed you mean could they just", "89:13", "turn a big telescope in our direction", "89:15", "and gather some radio waves you know but", "89:20", "but yes I would take that bet because", "89:22", "frankly we've only been generating radio", "89:24", "wave for the last you know seventy years", "89:26", "so it's only a 70 light year ball around", "89:28", "us and within that small radius very", "89:31", "unlikely that there's been some alien", "89:33", "world that's examining us so it would", "89:34", "have to be something that would be able", "89:36", "to recognize our signal and visit us", "89:38", "right but don't we look at observable", "89:41", "planets and solar systems and discover", "89:44", "Goldilocks planets we didn't we examine", "89:47", "those planets from vast distances away", "89:50", "yes and wouldn't you assume that a", "89:52", "life-form that is perhaps thousands of", "89:55", "years more advanced than us with the", "89:57", "exponential increase in yes knowledge II", "89:59", "mean if they ever got to the point where", "90:00", "we are that they would see these", "90:02", "Goldilocks planets as well and recognize", "90:05", "that Earth is one of them yes however if", "90:07", "they are so far away they're going to be", "90:09", "examining earth as it was hundreds of", "90:13", "thousands or millions or billions of", "90:14", "years ago right so if you truly want", "90:16", "them to be examining us in the sense of", "90:18", "human presence on planet Earth then it's", "90:21", "a much more difficult proposition to", "90:23", "imagine that they've actually been doing", "90:24", "is it possible there's another way to", "90:26", "examine things where you're not hampered", "90:28", "by the speed of light oh not not not on", "90:31", "that I know of I mean any signal in the", "90:34", "world that we're aware of is restricted", "90:37", "by a very by the speed of travel which", "90:40", "is now look there's quantum entanglement", "90:43", "which is a strange property of

like what is", "101:11", "happening here this is so unexpected to", "101:15", "me and what it really meant was I was so", "101:17", "close-minded into the varieties of", "101:20", "religious engagement that happened in", "101:22", "the world and it opened my eyes and", "101:25", "there's one noble Lord in particular I", "101:27", "did say to him at the end I said when", "101:28", "you look at me and you hear my view what", "101:31", "do you think and he kind of put his arm", "101:33", "around me in an avuncular what and said", "101:36", "you know you're you're a real smart guy",

no absolutely", "102:08", "but I was the one who was far round one", "102:10", "I was the one who were untethered yeah I", "102:12", "mean I came in there I was like whoa you", "102:14", "know and and and and and and clearly", "102:17", "they arranged the meeting to have a", "102:19", "spectrum of perspectives I mean this is", "102:21", "not something that was randomly designed", "102:23", "and it just so happened but it was an", "102:26", "eye opener now and from that I went to", "102:28", "read you know William James's book a", "102:30", "varieties of religious experience", "102:32", "no maybe yeah so it's a book that", "102:33", "William James great psychologist wrote", "102:35", "in 1902", "102:36", "and it was based on a series of lectures", "102:39", "I think he gave in Scotland
