["00:01", "three two one and we're live how are you", "00:06", "sir hey I'm great thanks for being here", "00:08", "man I really appreciate it it is the", "00:09", "coolest thing I've done really ever I", "00:15", "watched your TED talk on what was the", "00:18", "word that used Lester land", "00:21", "Lester yeah and it felt hopeless like", "00:25", "for people who don't know what I'm", "00:27", "talking about could you just give like a", "00:29", "brief synopsis of the way you were", "00:31", "describing how complete completely", "00:35", "rigged our election system is and and", "00:38", "what what it actually takes to be", "00:41", "elected and how much of the time they", "00:43", "spend is involved in raising money and", "00:47", "why yes so we've got a system where we", "00:50", "have a money primary and then we have a", "00:54", "regular election and in the money", "00:56", "primary to compete you gotta raise tons", "00:59", "of money to be able to fund your", "01:01", "campaign and when you raise that money", "01:03", "you raise it from a tiny tiny fraction", "01:05", "of the 1% so unless in the in the TED", "01:08", "talk about Lester no I said you know", "01:10", "imagine a place called Lester land where", "01:14", "basically it's the Lester's who rule and", "01:18", "by the Lester's I mean the same", "01:21", "proportion of people named Lester as in", "01:22", "the United States right now so there's", "01:23", "about a hundred and fifty thousand", "01:25", "Americans named Lester I'm one of them", "01:27", "but here we are", "01:27", "the Lester's so imagine a world ruled by", "01:30", "Lester land because that's essentially", "01:33", "the world we have because of the way we", "01:37", "fund our campaigns because there's about", "01:39", "a hundred and fifty thousand men who", "01:42", "give even just the maximum contribution", "01:44", "to one political candidate if you ask", "01:48", "who the number of people who give the", "01:49", "maximum contribution over the course of", "01:51", "a campaign meaning in the primary in the", "01:53", "general election it's about twenty-two", "01:54", "thousand Americans in 2014 who gave them", "01:58", "maximum contribution to one political", "02:00", "campaign so what that means is it's a", "02:02", "tiny tiny fraction who are the most", "02:05", "important funders of political campaigns", "02:08", "and candidates for Congress and members", "02:11", "of Congress spent thirty to seventy", "02:13", "their time sucking up to this tiny tiny", "02:17", "fraction and so is it any surprise that", "02:20", "you see Congress bending over backwards", "02:23", "to keep those guys happy because they", "02:26", "know without those people they don't", "02:28", "have a shot at getting back into", "02:30", "Congress and the way you were describing", "02:32", "it as when you're saying it as", "02:34", "lesterland", "02:34", "it was like imagine if we were this", "02:36", "screwed up that was essentially what", "02:38", "you're saying yeah but we're more", "02:40", "screwed up than is lesterland yeah that", "02:43", "was a disturbing video because I was", "02:46", "realized it was emerging as you were", "02:48", "speaking I was like wait a minute is it", "02:51", "that bad", "02:52", "yeah you know it's I actually since that", "02:55", "video I've come to think it's even worse", "02:57", "so guys a clarence land well it could be", "03:03", "worse because it's even smaller number", "03:05", "and if you look at the number of super", "03:07", "PAC donors you know the really critical", "03:10", "super PAC down about a hundred people", "03:11", "who gave more than half of the super PAC", "03:14", "money in the last presidential election", "03:15", "you know a hundred you know so this is a", "03:18", "really tiny tiny number but what this", "03:21", "tiny number represents in the way we", "03:23", "fund campaigns is the extraordinary", "03:26", "inequality on that dimension right but", "03:29", "since since I was focused on the money", "03:32", "I've you know more recently but start", "03:34", "thinking about the other screwed up", "03:35", "dimensions so think about gerrymandering", "03:37", "you know we gerrymander districts in", "03:39", "America so that about 85 percent of the", "03:42", "House seats in the United States", "03:44", "Congress our safe seats which means if", "03:47", "you're a Republican in a safe seat", "03:49", "democratic district your views just", "03:51", "never matter to the Congress person", "03:53", "because that vote of a Republican will", "03:56", "never determine who's in Congress or a", "03:58", "Democrat and safe seat Republican", "04:00", "district that's that's the same okay but", "04:02", "that doesn't mean those Congress people", "04:03", "are not afraid about re-election of", "04:07", "course they are afraid about whether", "04:08", "they'll be reelected but they're afraid", "04:10", "not of a Democrat running against a", "04:12", "Republican they're afraid of an even", "04:14", "more extreme Republican running against", "04:16", "the incumbent Republican so what those", "04:18", "incumbents in those safe seat districts", "04:21", "do is they obsess about what the", "04:25", "extremists in their own party", "04:27", "cares about so the extremists on the", "04:30", "left and the right have this ability to", "04:32", "leverage extraordinary influence inside", "04:35", "of the House of Representatives simply", "04:37", "because we've decided to gerrymander", "04:39", "these districts to create these safe", "04:41", "seats so those extremists are a kind of", "04:44", "Lester's too there are more of them you", "04:46", "know it's more democratic than", "04:47", "lesterland", "04:48", "but they too have enormous influence", "04:51", "over ordinary people and most ordinary", "04:52", "people's views then to these Congress", "04:54", "people just don't matter that feels", "04:58", "hopeless for a dummy like me sitting on", "05:01", "the outside looking at this and like God", "05:03", "if this is this deeply entrenched with I", "05:08", "mean I guess it's not technically", "05:12", "corruption because it's all legal but", "05:15", "it's an entanglement with money and with", "05:18", "influence that that I mean how do you", "05:22", "unwind this yeah so that point is really", "05:24", "critical it's not technically illegal", "05:27", "hmm and what that means is the people", "05:30", "are engaged in this are not doing wrong", "05:32", "things they're just playing by the rules", "05:34", "right they're playing with the system", "05:35", "it's just that the system has become", "05:38", "corrupted when did it start well I think", "05:41", "that the moment the United States", "05:43", "Congress begins to fall apart in a", "05:46", "really dramatic and interesting way is", "05:48", "when Newt Gingrich becomes Speaker of", "05:50", "the House so when the Republicans take", "05:53", "control of Congress in 95 it's the first", "05:57", "time the Republicans have taken control", "05:58", "of the House of Representatives in 40", "06:00", "years so the house becomes incredibly", "06:02", "competitive each election you know is up", "06:04", "for grabs who's going to control the", "06:06", "house so Gingrich turns his members in", "06:10", "the house into perpetual fundraisers", "06:12", "it's basically we got to raise the money", "06:14", "to defend ourselves the next time around", "06:16", "and then the Democrats followed suit so", "06:18", "the Democrats turned their members into", "06:20", "perpetual fundraisers and they changed", "06:22", "the rules about like who gets to be", "06:24", "chairmen of committees it's no longer", "06:26", "like who's the person with the most", "06:27", "experience or the most insight", "06:28", "increasingly becomes who raises the most", "06:30", "money and the democratic party I know", "06:33", "about the Democratic Party the", "06:34", "Republicans don't talk to me much but", "06:36", "the Democratic Party increasingly", "06:37", "changes its focus from what are the", "06:40", "policies that our members care about -", "06:44", "what are we going to do to make sure", "06:45", "that you as a member meet your", "06:47", "fundraising target and so from 95 until", "06:51", "today the institution becomes an", "06:55", "institution focused on the game of", "06:56", "getting reelected", "06:58", "I'm Jim Cooper a Democrat from Tennessee", "07:00", "who went to Congress first in like 1983", "07:03", "so he's been there for a long time", "07:05", "Cooper says Capitol Hill has become a", "07:08", "kind of farm League for K Street okay so", "07:11", "what do you mean by that is members go", "07:13", "there they learn how to raise money they", "07:14", "become focused obsessively on raising", "07:16", "money but one of the things that they're", "07:18", "really focused on it's how do they go", "07:20", "from Capitol Hill to becoming a lobbyist", "07:23", "because that's where the real money is", "07:25", "you know a member of Congress gets paid", "07:26", "about as much as the students I ate at", "07:29", "the Harvard Law School in their first", "07:30", "year as lawyers you know so to ordinary", "07:33", "Americans it's a lot of money but two", "07:34", "people on Capitol Hill doesn't seem like", "07:36", "a lot of money but then they go and", "07:38", "become a lobbyist they can make ten", "07:39", "times that as a lobbyist and so what", "07:42", "Cooper says is you have this institution", "07:44", "which has become so focused on the money", "07:46", "that it's it's just institution for", "07:51", "producing influence that can be sold and", "07:54", "first the congressmen are basically", "07:56", "sucking up to the people who want to buy", "07:58", "influence and then the congressmen", "08:00", "become the people buying influence", "08:01", "themselves because they're working as", "08:03", "lobbyists for these important interests", "08:05", "so they're in the rigged game they", "08:07", "understand how it gets rigged and then", "08:09", "they work to rig it yeah yeah they could", "08:12", "they see this is their business their", "08:15", "honeypot yeah and there's whatever the", "08:18", "district is outside of Washington DC in", "08:20", "Virginia where there's some ungodly", "08:22", "number of wealthy people per capita", "08:24", "where there's more there's more", "08:27", "lobbyists in that area than anywhere", "08:29", "else in the United States right and", "08:30", "that's this is a giant collection of", "08:33", "wealth right Washington DC is an", "08:35", "incredibly prosperous place and anybody", "08:38", "who's been there um you know for a long", "08:40", "who've seen it for a long time like I I", "08:42", "clerked there in the early 1990s and it", "08:44", "was a pretty grungy place but it's a", "08:46", "really opulent City now it's like the", "08:49", "golden city on the hill you know the Oz", "08:52", "and the reason for that is", "08:54", "the extraordinary amount of money that's", "08:56", "been poured into that district for the", "08:58", "purpose of buying influence to buy", "09:00", "legislation that makes it so these", "09:02", "incumbent dinosaur corporations that", "09:05", "have protected themselves against", "09:06", "competition across the country can", "09:09", "continue to profit it's a weird place", "09:12", "though because even though it's", "09:13", "incredibly wealthy it's also incredibly", "09:15", "Pullen there's a vast difference yeah", "09:19", "the the spectrum is really wide because", "09:22", "I mean that was one in the 90s was that", "09:24", "that's the Marion Barry time right yeah", "09:26", "so this one I mean he won as mayor again", "09:30", "when he came back after being arrested", "09:32", "for smoking crack yeah", "09:33", "and people like whatever yeah a little", "09:36", "crack yeah it's it was an ugly place", "09:39", "then it's becoming you know grotesque", "09:41", "place now from the from the standpoint", "09:43", "of the principles of what America is", "09:45", "supposed to be yeah", "09:46", "because the privilege there are not", "09:50", "people who are privileged because they", "09:52", "have you know Elon Musk like invented a", "09:54", "great new product or they've worked", "09:55", "incredibly hard in a competitive", "09:57", "marketplace and succeeded their", "09:59", "privilege because they've leveraged", "10:01", "influence in a corrupt system to to", "10:05", "profit and the people who are failing", "10:08", "they're you know a lot of reasons", "10:10", "they're failing is just we don't have a", "10:12", "competitive powerful economy that gives", "10:15", "them any opportunities right now because", "10:16", "that that district Washington DC because", "10:18", "it's got no effective representation is", "10:20", "one of the worst represented districts", "10:22", "in the country so essentially this all", "10:24", "started out with Newt Gingrich's group", "10:27", "and they decided to spend so much time", "10:30", "concentrating on fund raising and then", "10:32", "once that became successful everyone", "10:35", "else followed suit yeah yeah so the game", "10:37", "became no longer how do we legislate for", "10:39", "America but how do we rally our troops", "10:41", "to raise the money we need to win in the", "10:43", "next election the game is just about the", "10:45", "election I mean you know my mother lives", "10:47", "in in Hilton Head which is of course a", "10:49", "very Republican district but they", "10:52", "elected their first Democrat Joe", "10:53", "Cunningham and Joe my mother loved him", "10:57", "and wanted to support him my mother's a", "10:59", "Republican but here he was she wanted to", "11:00", "support a Democrat so I said I check for", "11:03", "on her behalf - this Democrat the day he", "11:05", "was elected", "11:07", "he started raising money for the next", "11:09", "election his whole focus from that", "11:11", "moment on and now he started a big", "11:12", "membership organization where they can", "11:14", "get members to sort of help him sort of", "11:16", "get back to Congress the next time", "11:17", "around their sole focus is the elections", "11:21", "and this is really different in the", "11:23", "1980s you know they would go to", "11:25", "Washington for 18 months they would do", "11:28", "the work of governing and then for six", "11:30", "months they do the work of politicking", "11:32", "so you know to a year and a half they", "11:35", "could figure out how to solve the", "11:36", "problems of America and then for a half", "11:38", "a year they figured out how to get", "11:39", "reelected that's no longer the game the", "11:42", "game now is from day one how do we raise", "11:45", "the funds we need to make sure we can", "11:46", "get reelected and with the Democrats", "11:50", "extraordinary turnaround in this last", "11:52", "election you can be damn sure that's", "11:53", "exactly the obsessive focus that will be", "11:56", "going into 2020 and if there's no other", "11:59", "viable alternative this is a game that", "12:01", "they have to play yeah", "12:03", "good people have to play it this is the", "12:04", "point it's not like you can have the", "12:06", "good people who say I'm not gonna play", "12:08", "this game I mean there are some famous", "12:09", "people who could say I'm not gonna play", "12:11", "this game you know Alexandria okay Joe", "12:15", "Cortez I mean she doesn't have to raise", "12:17", "money I'm sure and people on the right -", "12:20", "you know who are the famous people all", "12:21", "right they don't have to worry about", "12:22", "this but the ordinary Congress person", "12:24", "knows given the way the system is right", "12:27", "now they've got to obsessively focus on", "12:30", "how to raise money you know what they", "12:32", "not but that means is they develop a", "12:34", "sixth sense a constant awareness about", "12:36", "how what they do will affect their", "12:38", "ability to raise money become in the", "12:40", "words of the x-files shapeshifters as", "12:42", "they constantly adjust their views in", "12:44", "light of what they know will help them", "12:46", "to raise money there's a congressman", "12:49", "Leslie Byrne Democrat from Virginia who", "12:50", "describes that when she went to Congress", "12:52", "she was told by a colleague quote always", "12:54", "lean to the green than to clarify she", "12:57", "went on you know he was not an", "12:59", "environmentalist so the point is like", "13:01", "you know in your heart of hearts which", "13:04", "way you got to go to make sure and if", "13:07", "you're good and you're smart you'd never", "13:08", "say anything to indicate it but it's", "13:10", "operating but sometimes you're not so", "13:12", "smart so in the tax bill the leading up", "13:15", "to the passage of the last tax cut you", "13:18", "know the one point six trillion dollar", "13:19", "gift to corporations and", "13:21", "Elfi people primarily a congressman New", "13:24", "York stood on the floor of the house and", "13:26", "said you know my donors have told me", "13:28", "that if we don't deliver on this", "13:30", "I should never call him again I should", "13:32", "never call them again so it's basically", "13:34", "you know as simple and clear as possible", "13:36", "you don't reduce our taxes don't ever", "13:39", "ask us for more money and and that's the", "13:42", "reality of what Washington has become", "13:43", "now once this gets started and it moves", "13:47", "in this direction we don't have a long", "13:49", "history of this to understand the the", "13:52", "waves and the ins and the outs of the", "13:54", "tide it just this is what it is and it", "13:56", "keeps moving in the same general", "13:58", "direction how would at that ever stop", "14:00", "how would there ever be some sort of", "14:02", "reform that puts this back into a", "14:04", "position where it makes sense and it's", "14:05", "tenable yeah so you know I've been in", "14:08", "this business for about 12 years now in", "14:11", "the business of like trying to figure", "14:13", "out what can we do yeah to reform this", "14:16", "corrupted system and you know part of me", "14:19", "feels as you said like it's hopeless but", "14:22", "part of me feels like it's the most", "14:23", "hopeful moment we've seen because like a", "14:25", "decade ago when I would go around and", "14:29", "say you know we got this really", "14:29", "corrupted system and like money is", "14:31", "really people say no when are you", "14:32", "talking about no we just have to focus", "14:36", "on getting the people we want elected", "14:37", "and if we get the people we want to like", "14:39", "it we'll get the policies we all want", "14:40", "past now almost everybody realizes that", "14:44", "until we fix this broken Congress", "14:48", "nothing else can happen so it's not like", "14:50", "this is the most important issue out", "14:52", "there you know you can think climate", "14:53", "change or healthcare or jobs or", "14:55", "competitive you can think those are the", "14:57", "important issues but what people", "14:59", "increasingly seeing is that this is the", "15:01", "first issue if we don't fix this we", "15:05", "don't fix anything", "15:06", "and what's really encouraging to me is", "15:08", "that that frame is increasingly being", "15:11", "embraced by important leaders so you", "15:14", "know about six years ago I think Nancy", "15:17", "Pelosi was on Jon Stewart's show The", "15:21", "Daily Show and Stewart said you know the", "15:23", "whole system is corrupt and Nancy", "15:24", "Pelosi's no no the system's not corrupt", "15:26", "it people in the system are corrupt but", "15:29", "the Pistons not corrupt and Jon Stewart", "15:30", "just had a field day because of how", "15:32", "ridiculous that statement is now but now", "15:34", "Nancy Pelosi", "15:35", "is going to introduce as HR 1 the most", "15:40", "ambitious and comprehensive reform", "15:44", "package that Washington I think has ever", "15:47", "seen I mean it is unbelievable in its", "15:50", "breadth so it has public funding of", "15:53", "congressional campaigns so that", "15:55", "congressmen don't spend 30 to 70 percent", "15:58", "of their time sucking up to look to the", "16:00",

about it because most", "16:39", "people look at what Washington does and", "16:41", "says it's just a game the Democrats are", "16:43", "playing to embarrass the Republicans how", "16:45", "would they stop congressmen from", "16:47", "becoming lobbyists well one thing they", "16:50", "do and then the loopholes into it but", "16:53", "one thing they can do is they can", "16:54", "basically say once your Congressman you", "16:57", "can't be a lobbyist for five years and", "16:59", "for five years yeah or whatever the time", "17:01", "is but the more fundamental fact is you", "17:03", "know if you change the way you fund", "17:05", "campaigns if it was no longer the", "17:09", "lobbyists who were kind of channeling", "17:10", "the money in or that were getting their", "17:12", "clients to channel the money in then", "17:15", "it's not like there wouldn't be", "17:15", "lobbyists anymore they just wouldn't be", "17:17", "so well paid they wouldn't be as", "17:19", "valuable hmm and if they're not as", "17:21", "valuable it's not as valuable for them", "17:23", "to pay the congressman an incredible", "17:25", "amount of money to become konk lobbyist", "17:27", "you know they would become almost like", "17:29", "you know lawyers policy wants they kind", "17:31", "of go to Capitol Hill and say here's", "17:32", "what will happen if you adopt this", "17:34", "legislation you know that's an important", "17:36", "part of the process but they wouldn't be", "17:38", "the mockers in the system they wouldn't", "17:40", "be the people who called the shots and", "17:42", "so the

says that if you're a", "58:13", "Republican in California your vote never", "58:16", "matters if you're a Democrat in Texas", "58:18", "your vote never matters because we just", "58:19", "count your vote up and then we throw it", "58:22", "away right because we allocate all the", "58:23", "electors to the dominant party in your", "58:26", "state and so we've got David Boies as", "58:29", "our

instead say that electors have to be", "58:42", "allocated proportionally", "58:43", "so if you get 40% of the vote in the", "58:45", "state you get 40% of the electors if you", "58:47", "get 50% you get 50% of the doctors and", "58:49", "what that would do overnight is it would", "58:53", "make every state in the nation", "58:55", "competitive like there'd be a reason for", "58:57", "a Democrat to go to Texas because you're", "59:01", "not gonna get all the electoral votes", "59:02", "you're not gonna get 1/2 the electoral", "59:04", "votes but you'll get 40% maybe 45% and", "59:07", "that could matter or a Republican would", "59:09", "go to California because you know you're", "59:12", "not gonna get all the votes in", "59:13", "California but you're gonna get a lot", "59:14", "there a lot of Republicans in California", "59:16", "um so this change would immediately make", "59:19", "every state in play but unlike the", "59:22", "national popular vote alternative there", "59:25", "are many people who look at this and say", "59:26", "this would be better because small", "59:28", "states would still have a pretty", "59:29", "important role like an elector as an", "59:31", "elector and if I can get it from Arizona", "59:32", "I'm gonna care about Arizona if I can", "59:34", "get from Arkansas I'll care about", "59:35", "Arkansas I'm so it's not gonna just be", "59:37", "the big states or the big population", "59:40", "centers it's going to be every state and", "59:41", "so if we can get you know a court to say", "59:44", "this violates the Constitution then you", "59:47", "could have states forests to allocate", "59:51", "their electors proportionally and if", "59:53", "they did that then the problem that you", "59:56", "identified at the start which I", "59:57", "is the problem could be solved overnight", "60:00", "you would no longer have these", "60:01", "battleground states deciding everything", "60:02", "you never president who cares about", "60:04", "getting elected by all of America and", "60:06", "that would be an incredible improvement", "60:08", "though that seems like in in and of", "60:11", "itself would be a game-changer yes if", "60:13", "they could do that that would change a", "60:14", "lot but one of the things you said you", "60:17", "said you don't think that it's possible", "60:20", "that we would ever vote out the", "60:22", "Electoral College but is there support", "60:24", "for the electoral college is there a", "60:26", "good argument for it so there is support", "60:30", "for the idea that every state have a", "60:34", "role and there's a support for the idea", "60:37", "that small states got a kind of thumb on", "60:39", "the scale which is what the Electoral", "60:41", "College does so there is some support", "60:43", "but most people you know 70% of people", "60:46", "don't like the idea that the president", "60:48", "is not chosen from the majority of", "60:51", "voters though right so most people would", "60:53", "oppose it but the point is to change the", "60:55", "Constitution you need the state", "60:59", "legislatures or state conventions to", "61:02", "agree with the change and what many", "61:04", "states at least 13 states I fear would", "61:07", "say is that you know we actually win", "61:09", "more under the system than we lose so", "61:11", "we're not gonna change the system and so", "61:14", "unless you get like some overwhelmingly", "61:16", "popular movement to support it or again", "61:19", "you know you can imagine a presidential", "61:20", "candidate who kind of made fixing this", "61:22", "part of the democracy part of the plan", "61:24", "too I don't see how you're gonna build", "61:26", "the political movement to get there", "61:28", "another way of putting it is you know", "61:30", "this national popular vote compact which", "61:33", "is going around state to state in", "61:35", "getting states to join right now has", "61:36", "about a hundred and so the way this", "61:38", "works is that when the equivalent of 270", "61:42", "electoral votes have been committed", "61:44", "then the compact kicks in so when they", "61:47", "get to 270 the problem goes you know the", "61:50", "problem of this electoral college goes", "61:51", "away because at 270 according to the", "61:53", "plan the winner of the popular vote wins", "61:55", "the electoral college they right now", "61:57", "have a hundred and seventy two electors", "61:59", "pledged right so they have less than 100", "62:02", "more to go but the problem is they've", "62:05", "got to convince states to join the", "62:07", "compact", "62:08", "and they're kind of they kind of hit", "62:11", "this red wall now because many", "62:13", "Republicans think the only way to win", "62:14", "the presidency is through the electoral", "62:16", "college now so many state legislators", "62:18", "why do they believe that I think many", "62:21", "Republicans just think that their great", "62:23", "benefit is from the electoral college", "62:25", "it's not surprising because the", "62:26", "battleground states are primarily", "62:28", "Republic and because the base number of", "62:30", "Republican states is so high right", "62:32", "because you know these small rural", "62:34", "states get disproportionately more", "62:37", "electors than states like California so", "62:39", "you know Wyoming has three electors", "62:41", "disproportionately turns with the", "62:42", "population right so they like the system", "62:44", "as it is and you know you look back and", "62:46", "you say well they got George Bush even", "62:48", "though he didn't win the national vote", "62:50", "and they got Donald Trump even though he", "62:52", "didn't win the national vote it's not", "62:53", "hard for to understand why they're there", "62:55", "I think again I I don't think they're", "62:57", "right about this you know in 2004 if", "63:01", "fifty thousand votes had switched to", "63:04", "John Kerry in Ohio then John Kerry would", "63:07", "have won the electoral college but lost", "63:10", "the popular vote and if that had", "63:12", "happened in 2004 I think the Electoral", "63:14", "College would be dead today really", "63:16", "because a Republican won in 2000 a", "63:19", "Democrat run in 2004 people would say", "63:21", "this system is just crazy we got to get", "63:23", "rid of this system but now people think", "63:25", "well Republicans benefit from this so", "63:27", "I'm a Republican I'm gonna block the", "63:29", "change and if that's true that it's", "63:30", "never going to happen at a", "63:31", "constitutional level because the", "63:34", "Constitution requires three-fourths of", "63:35", "the states to support the reform and the", "63:37", "reinforcement it does that Donald Trump", "63:39", "won without having the popular one yeah", "63:40", "yeah and you know of course nothing", "63:43", "there's no hypocrisy that touches this", "63:46", "president but we remember in 2012 when", "63:50", "there was a moment for about 10 minutes", "63:52", "when the national media was reporting", "63:54", "that that Romney was going to win the", "63:57", "popular vote but Barack Obama was going", "63:59", "to be elected by the electoral college", "64:01", "Trump started tweeting vigorously about", "64:04", "how this is a denial of democracy we", "64:06", "have to march on Washington to end this", "64:08", "banana republic like system because the", "64:10", "electoral college was the worst possible", "64:11", "thing in the world and of course after", "64:13", "2016 he had different views about the", "64:15", "electoral college I wasn't old enough to", "64:17", "understand what was going on during", "64:19", "Watergate", "64:22", "what year was that well 70 so you know", "64:25", "the break-in happens in the lead-up to", "64:27", "the 72 election and then he eventually", "64:29", "resigns after that but this is our", "64:31", "Watergate yeah at this moment right now", "64:33", "Cohen's gonna go to jail for three years", "64:36", "and I mean he's testifying against Trump", "64:38", "and all these people are testifying and", "64:40", "they're calling him what do they call", "64:42", "him co-conspirator number one is that", "64:44", "the individual official individual", "64:47", "number one this is a very unusual moment", "64:51", "for us to be watching this all unfold", "64:54", "and to see this slow dissection what", "64:58", "Mueller seems to be doing is like slowly", "65:00", "closing off all the escape routes yeah", "65:03", "and slowly circling the troops around", "65:05", "this one area that he's trying to that", "65:08", "he's that he's attacking yeah so on he's", "65:11", "a brilliant tactician yeah and and and", "65:16", "so I think it's clear that the worst for", "65:18", "Donald Trump has yet to come and I do", "65:21", "think the parallel is Watergate but", "65:23", "there's a really important difference", "65:24", "here you know um so I'm old enough to", "65:27", "remember what Watergate I was like 12 or", "65:29", "13 when this happened and my uncle", "65:31", "happened to be the lawyer who worked in", "65:33", "the House of Representatives convincing", "65:35", "the House of Representatives to vote the", "65:37", "articles of impeachment so he and that", "65:40",

"visit us and he told me if this was", "65:50", "going to happen and that was the event", "65:52", "that was the weekend and I decided I", "65:54", "wanted to become a lawyer but but the", "65:57", "big difference between these two times", "65:59", "is that when that happened the way most", "66:03", "people got access to news was three", "66:06", "television networks every day they", "66:09", "watched the news at the same time", "66:11", "because there was nothing else on and", "66:13", "those three television networks kind of", "66:15", "shot right down the middle and told the", "66:17",

"66:28", "a pretty damning indictment of the", "66:31", "President", "66:32", "and what's amazing is he watched the", "66:34", "polling among Republicans and their", "66:36", "support for the president six months", "66:38", "before the president resigns the poll", "66:41", "says among Republicans he has about an", "66:43", "83 percent support rate and then when he", "66:46", "resigns his support rate about", "66:47", "Republicans is about 50 percent and", "66:49", "that's because the news newspapers and", "66:52", "television had like told everybody the", "66:54", "same story and

that this president you know", "67:33", "needs to resign or be impeached I don't", "67:37", "think you should be impeach but let's", "67:38", "that's a separate question is is not", "67:40", "possible and that's what's so terrifying", "67:42", "about it when you live in a democracy", "67:45", "where we don't all live in the same", "67:47", "universe you know right we don't know", "67:50", "the same

than 30 second bites yes and", "69:35", "podcasting I think is a core part of", "69:37", "that is it entirely possible that", "69:39", "something could be profitable that does", "69:41", "shoot down the middle because people are", "69:43", "so tired of this CNN Fox bipolar", "69:47", "distribution of information I mean I", "69:49", "remember when the elections were going", "69:50", "on I would

different worlds of what", "70:01", "they're projecting yes but I don't think", "70:03", "the point is that it has to be down the", "70:05", "middle right I think it has to be deep", "70:07", "so this is what I think is so powerful", "70:09", "about podcasting like you know the fact", "70:12", "that you get people to listen to you", "70:14", "talk about an idea for an hour two hours", "70:17", "of them three hours is astonishing", "70:20", "literally astonishing in an age where", "70:22", "the most a cable news channel will", "70:25", "allocate to a news story is a minute and", "70:27", "a half two minutes three minutes right", "70:30", "and you know in the context of like the", "70:31", "tweet thinking of cable news they can't", "70:34", "afford to go deep on anything and", "70:37",

gonna get", "71:00", "anywhere and the only way to get to", "71:02", "that's to get someplace is to begin to", "71:04", "have conversations that are at the", "71:05", "hour-long chunk or the two-hour

know", "72:01", "funny playful but in the end at the end", "72:04", "of the hour-long", "72:05", "segment of a podcast you understand", "72:07", "something you didn't understand before I", "72:09",

think that you know that's", "72:20", "number two I think shows like homeland I", "72:23", "don't have you know watch rights watched", "72:26", "it until the read yeah yeah I know and", "72:28", "then that went through this dark period", "72:29", "in the middle but the recent seasons are", "72:32", "just", "72:32", "un-fuckin'-believable really and because", "72:35", "they're unbelievable because they are", "72:37", "such a deep rich understanding of the", "72:40", "tensions at issue like you want to", "72:42", "understand the Iran nuclear deal watch", "72:46", "the last season because after

you", "72:57", "imagine television shows aspiring to", "73:01", "tell the story in an entertaining way in", "73:03", "a way that brings people in there that", "73:05", "they voluntarily want to watch it but", "73:07", "that in the end at the end of watching a", "73:10", "season you understand something I", "73:11", "understand the current seasons about the", "73:13", "you know struggle and I can't

"73:23", "until the season did you quit at this", "73:25", "season I watched the season I was very", "73:27", "disappointed right I watched episode one", "73:29", "and I said this is seems like gave it to", "73:31", "some different writers and it's just", "73:32", "craziness it just seems like like", "73:35", "somebody just got a hold of it and they", "73:37", "said I'll take it you know I'm gonna", "73:38", "write it my own way", "73:39", "Yeah right but even at the very", "73:40", "beginning you know the striking thing", "73:42", "about house of cards is it made it seem", "73:44", "like stuff actually could happen in", "73:46", "Washington yes you're like wow this", "73:48", "really powerful guy Frank Underwood", "73:49", "actually can actually get important", "73:51", "bills passed right and I remember", "73:53", "watching that saying holy shit this is", "73:55", "just completely not the truth this is", "73:58", "just not the way the system works I mean", "73:59", "it would be good if it worked like that", "74:01", "cuz at least it could do stuff but the", "74:03", "way it actually works is that these guys", "74:06", "would be scurrying around trying to", "74:07", "figure out you know what the tentacles", "74:09", "of funders are directing them to do and", "74:11", "the tentacles of funders added together", "74:14", "would be don't do anything that's not", "74:16", "what you're there to do hmm but what it", "74:19", "at least did is sort of highlight the", "74:22", "influences these people experienced and", "74:24", "it showed how deeply entrenched", "74:28",

"74:37", "just give them a richer understanding", "74:39", "well an understanding period because for", "74:42", "the most part what people you go to", "74:44", "school you learn about democracy and our", "74:46", "system of representative government and", "74:49", "then you become an adult and you forget", "74:51", "most of what you learned and then you", "74:53", "hear something about the electoral", "74:54", "college and the popular vote and you", "74:56", "know then you see bills getting passed", "74:58", "you know what the hell is that and and", "75:01", "the stuff you learn at school is so", "75:03", "politically correct it can't actually", "75:04", "give you an understanding of anything", "75:06", "like you actually taught kids in high", "75:08", "school the way Congress worked you you", "75:11", "know the school board would go crazy and", "75:12", "they're like no no no you can't talk", "75:13", "down American democracy like that so the", "75:16", "truth is not teachable the only way to", "75:18", "get people to see the truth is to expose", "75:20", "it to them in a way that they want to", "75:22", "see it and you know my point is that's", "75:24", "not going to be Fox News", "75:26", "Fox News can never cover it at the depth", "75:28", "and the interest level that it needs to", "75:30", "be covered it's going to be things like", "75:32", "what you do or things like what you know", "75:35", "great television can do is our system of", "75:37", "government analogous to like taking like", "75:41", "DOS or Windows 95 or something like that", "75:43", "just continuing to patch it and never", "75:45", "revisit it and never come up with a new", "75:47", "operating system I think the better", "75:49", "analogy is an operating system that has", "75:52", "been taken over by malware virus yeah", "75:56", "because it's not innocent", "75:59", "you know das you know it was a fun", "76:01", "system and it like cranked to a halt", "76:04", "after a while when you tried to pile", "76:05", "more and more on top of it but that was", "76:07", "just kind of the limits of what it could", "76:08", "do there was nothing malicious in its", "76:11", "failure but but there's something", "76:13", "malicious in this failure there are", "76:15", "people who are eagerly focused on how to", "76:18", "make sure our government can't govern", "76:20", "because if our government can't govern", "76:23", "they win so you know the Koch brothers", "76:26", "have this amazing diverted you know", "76:29", "bipolar character on the one hand", "76:31", "they're talking about the ideals of", "76:32", "government but the reality is their", "76:35", "interventions make it so we don't have", "76:37", "an EPA that can regulate their companies", "76:39", "so basically you know we have", "76:41", "environmental policy that leaves their", "76:43", "companies alone which means they can", "76:45", "make tons of money by polluting our", "76:47", "environment without ever having to pay", "76:49", "the consequence of it and what they want", "76:50", "is not change of a particular kind", "76:53", "except for tax cuts what they want is", "76:55", "nothing to happen and so that's the kind", "76:58", "of you know malware that's taken over", "77:00", "the system of our government that's", "77:02", "blocked the ability to government to", "77:03", "function and rather than having leaders", "77:06", "at the center who say hold it let's just", "77:09", "pause for a second and realize this is a", "77:11", "fucking broken system we have", "77:13", "politicians that continue to pretend as", "77:15", "if everything is working you just have", "77:16", "to elect more Democrats and we'll get", "77:17", "what we want yeah", "77:20", "voting online what what would be the", "77:24", "pitfalls of that and why hasn't that", "77:25", "been implemented if you can Bank online", "77:27", "why can't you vote online so I think you", "77:31", "know most of the tech are the experts", "77:33", "who are disinterested meaning they're", "77:36", "not working for Diebold or something", "77:38", "like that", "77:38", "I would tell you that we don't yet have", "77:40", "the infrastructure to be able to be", "77:42", "confident about this now there are lots", "77:44", "of people working on I think really", "77:46", "great open-source implementations that", "77:50", "that could be could eventually produce", "77:53", "the kind of confidence that we need to", "77:54", "have to be able to vote online and so I", "77:57", "don't foreclose it in the long run but I", "78:00", "think what we've seen in the short run", "78:01", "is that when we turn to these", "78:04", "proprietary providers of technology to", "78:07", "enable us to vote they give us shit you", "78:11", "know looky look at these voting machines", "78:12", "there's this recent story about this 11", "78:16", "year old who is able to within like 15", "78:20", "minutes hack into the Florida election", "78:24", "system and change the results from you", "78:28", "know one one candidate to another", "78:29", "because you know the companies that", "78:32", "build these technologies are not filled", "78:34", "with a bunch of rocket science just like", "78:36", "if you're really good you're gonna go", "78:37", "work for Google or for Facebook or", "78:39", "something like that so so the", "78:40", "proprietary software has all of these", "78:43", "bugs and holes and intended backdoors", "78:46", "built into an intended backdoor", "78:48", "yeah because they need you know the", "78:49", "company itself needs a simple way to get", "78:51", "in to check or to fix things but then", "78:53", "they don't worry about the fact that", "78:54", "other people will get backdoors to be", "78:56", "that again this was the argument for", "78:57", "Diebold system that did have a third", "78:59", "party entrance tons of allegations about", "79:03", "that yeah did you ever see the", "79:05", "documentary hacking democracy yeah is", "79:07", "that disturbing to you incredibly I", "79:09", "don't know how much I believe about it", "79:11", "and was a well because I've seen so much", "79:14", "that contradicts some of the claims", "79:15", "about you know the extent to which there", "79:17", "was real differences in the numbers I", "79:19", "remembered at the election really being", "79:21", "anxious about it because it seemed to me", "79:23", "in Ohio in particular a really", "79:25", "compelling case was made that there was", "79:28", "some something weird going on but you", "79:30", "know the point is not so that much the", "79:31", "particular zuv a particular election", "79:33", "it's recognizing that if you turn this", "79:36", "over to proprietary software companies", "79:38", "we're going to build these closed", "79:40", "systems nobody can inspect there's no", "79:42", "reason to trust them you know they're", "79:44", "it's not that they are intending to make", "79:47", "themselves vulnerable to the Russians", "79:48", "they're just going to make themselves", "79:50", "vulnerable to the Russians and there are", "79:52", "alternate", "79:52", "systems like open-source systems that", "79:54", "something I know some people are", "79:56", "building right now that I think", "79:57", "eventually could get us there an", "79:58", "open-source system like the Linux base", "80:00", "something that would go on to your phone", "80:01", "well it could be on your phone but the", "80:04", "point about the open-source is that", "80:05", "anybody can inspect the code and be", "80:08", "confident that the code is doing what it", "80:10", "says it's direct what I'm saying about", "80:12", "being on your phone is the the", "80:14", "biometrics that we use on our phone", "80:15", "today or some of the most secure in", "80:17", "terms of being able to establish that", "80:20", "it's you that's making that vote like", "80:22", "iris scanners that you have on the I", "80:24", "have a Samsung Note 9 that has an iris", "80:26", "scanner checks my eyeballs you know your", "80:28", "my iPhone checks my face it takes you", "80:31", "the shit I mean there's they're pretty", "80:32", "amazing you know fingerprints obviously", "80:35", "but the fact that this is probably in", "80:38", "terms of our own personal like security", "80:40", "in terms of information this is probably", "80:42", "the most secure our smartphones are", "80:44", "probably the most secure devices we've", "80:46", "ever possessed so on the one hand yes", "80:49", "and that's why I say I agree with you", "80:52", "that in the long run we should imagine a", "80:54", "world where to be trivially easy to vote", "80:56", "just like it's not easy for me to venmo", "80:57", "you or cache app you I guess is your", "81:02", "favorite here and money that should be", "81:05", "the way the future is but on the other", "81:07", "hand we need to realize that these", "81:09", "technologies are also incredibly", "81:11", "insecure in the sense that there is now", "81:15", "a commercial market to exploit", "81:17", "insecurities inside of these phones and", "81:20", "you know these companies basically have", "81:23", "bounties that they post on the web right", "81:25", "for people who will come forward and", "81:27", "find certain holes and hacks and once", "81:29", "they get those hacks they use them to", "81:33", "leverage power and governments play this", "81:36", "game all the time and you know there's a", "81:37", "pretty strong argument that the", "81:40", "khashoggi murder was a product of one of", "81:43", "these exploits which was then going to", "81:45", "be revealed and the need to cover up the", "81:48", "fact that there was such an exploit out", "81:49", "there what is this I didn't know this", "81:51", "what is this about well so the basic", "81:53", "idea is that you know these companies", "81:55", "and many of them most prominent ones", "81:57", "here are Israeli companies who", "81:59", "facilitate the ability of governments to", "82:01", "buy", "82:03", "to your phone mmm right and the the", "82:06", "standard way in which this is done is to", "82:07", "is to pierce the security by sending you", "82:10", "something that you click on it and then", "82:12", "embeds itself in the phone there's no", "82:13", "way you see it in a no way that done it", "82:17", "can be blocked but there's there's", "82:18", "rumors now that in fact we've got", "82:20", "something more than that going on where", "82:22", "all they need to do is get your", "82:23", "telephone number and they're able to", "82:24", "hack into the system to get access to", "82:25", "your phone but the point is these", "82:27", "companies have a market now for selling", "82:32", "this type of insecurity so belt-like", "82:35", "cell the ability for you to get access", "82:37", "here and the story that you know I don't", "82:39", "have a lot of reasons to be absolutely", "82:44", "confident about this except that I trust", "82:45", "the person who's inside the security", "82:47", "world that says this to me um the story", "82:50", "is that this is part of what happened to", "82:52", "khashoggi contacts that the Saudis had", "82:54", "exploited this in a way that was going", "82:56", "to be revealed and and the simple", "82:58", "solution to that eventual revelation was", "83:02", "to remove the person who would reveal it", "83:03", "and that's Jesus yes so this is the", "83:07", "point about to recognize about these", "83:08", "phones on the one hand for the ordinary", "83:11", "life it's more secure than anything", "83:13", "you've ever had but in the other hand", "83:16", "systematically it's building insecurity", "83:18", "into our lives in a way that can be", "83:20", "exploited by powerful people and for", "83:23", "most people doesn't matter like most", "83:25", "people ordinary ordinary Joe's", "83:29", "you know they're never gonna be", "83:30", "vulnerable because nobody's gonna spend", "83:32", "a million dollars to get a hack against", "83:34", "an individual person when I hear that", "83:35", "from a person justifying why they don't", "83:38", "worry about it it drives me crazy I", "83:40", "can't do anything what are they gonna do", "83:42", "um I'm clean don't worry about me that's", "83:45", "not that's not what we're doing this one", "83:46", "we're talking about right because if we", "83:48", "have a system where systematically", "83:50", "powerful people can just push a button", "83:51", "and like find a way to control you right", "83:54", "control anybody Jamal Kosova yeah then", "83:57", "we've got a system that no longer makes", "83:59", "it possible for ordinary people to stand", "84:02", "up to power that's that's basically what", "84:04", "it is like this is the this is a", "84:06", "structure that allows powerful people if", "84:08", "it is insecure to protect themselves", "84:11", "because they can just leverage that", "84:13", "against us and I think you know this is", "84:15", "a completely on", "84:16", "focused problem like nobody is talking", "84:19", "about this politically but the amar ket", "84:21", "for this commercialized security", "84:24", "exploits is hugely important and we've", "84:27", "got to find a way to to address it mmm", "84:31", "so is it feasible that as technology", "84:35", "advances and", "84:37", "as the security advances as well I mean", "84:39", "the biometrics that we have today are", "84:41", "far greater than the passwords that we", "84:42", "use just a few years ago that there", "84:46", "could be something that you can't", "84:48", "exploit especially considering the", "84:50", "open-source variants where they can be", "84:52", "checked by the community yeah so so so", "84:56", "the problem is is not the kind of", "84:58", "particular technologies working the way", "85:01", "you intend them to work you know if", "85:02", "you've got great biometric technologies", "85:05", "those are really good at making sure in", "85:08", "the ordinary case that you're the right", "85:10", "person using your phone but the problem", "85:13", "is the code is so big and so complicated", "85:16", "that there's always going to be little", "85:19", "bugs inside the code and what these", "85:22", "exploits are are like coders who like", "85:25", "poke at the code looking for these", "85:28", "little hooks and they link one hook to", "85:31", "another hook to another hook and then", "85:32", "they find the way in to exploit the", "85:34", "system so the exploits are never well I", "85:37", "won't say never there's another story", "85:38", "it's important to recognize I'll talk", "85:39", "about that a second but the exploits are", "85:41", "not in the main case intended by anybody", "85:43", "it's just the onion it's just the", "85:45", "natural consequence of having you know", "85:48", "literally hundreds or millions of lines", "85:51", "of code that go into making this machine", "85:53", "work and that's what's being exploited", "85:54", "and when you have a world like the", "85:56", "iPhone which is this monoculture like", "85:59", "you know everybody has the same", "86:01", "operating system or the same versions of", "86:02", "the operating system if you find an", "86:04", "exploit in the end the iOS and Apple", "86:07", "doesn't know about it", "86:08", "and you can exploit it for six months or", "86:11", "a year you can you know do a lot of", "86:13", "damage to a lot of people's lives before", "86:14", "anybody gets around to it to blocking it", "86:16", "um no you know that's even in the best", "86:18", "case where everybody's working

and you know the question", "91:35", "is what we mean by bias or", "91:37", "discrimination here like you know in", "91:39", "2017 in the fall it was revealed that", "91:41", "Facebook was selling ads

machines doing it no", "92:47", "doubt yeah but but to what extent you", "92:50", "want to say Facebook is doing it and I", "92:52", "think that's off that's often what", "92:54", "you're going to see in this argument", "92:55", "about whether they're quote biasing the", "92:57", "system against one side or the other you", "92:59", "know like this hilarious hearing that", "93:03", "was just held on

"93:13", "then um so you know I think this is nice", "93:15", "and quite fun it was really funny it", "93:17", "this is like nobody is intent we should", "93:20", "explain that to people who don't know", "93:21", "what we're talking about yeah so there", "93:23", "was an argument about you know whether", "93:24", "Google was tilting the ads to embarrass", "93:27", "one side or the other and I guess it was", "93:33", "a congressman from Iowa everybody liked", "93:34", "that", "93:35", "that's the guy who didn't know that", "93:37", "Google didn't make the iPhone yeah he", "93:39", "got embarrassed but anyway there was", "93:41", "this um you know the exchange was", "93:42", "basically here I'm gonna show you a", "93:43", "demonstration and they put in a certain", "93:45", "name and that's yeah congressman Smith", "93:47", "and then up comes this a reference to", "93:50", "his race-baiting yeah and he's like", "93:52", "outraged by this and you know so one", "93:55", "theory is you've got Google engineers", "93:56", "down there saying let's get congressman", "93:58", "Smith so we're gonna make it so every", "93:59", "time you put Smith in there up comes", "94:00", "Reese baiting but Google's responses", "94:02", "look we don't do individualized search", "94:04", "results like we give people what we", "94:06", "think people want based on what they've", "94:08", "done in the past and what they've shown", "94:10", "interest in and and so that's what's", "94:12", "producing this it's the machine that's", "94:14", "producing this result and that let", "94:16", "congressman Lou come back with you know", "94:18", "if you don't like the connections then", "94:20", "just don't enable them to be made I", "94:21", "don't doing things like don't do things", "94:23", "like race-baiting", "94:24", "yeah if you don't want negative search", "94:26", "results don't do negative yeah which is", "94:29", "a pretty but but I do think that it", "94:31", "there's a really hard problem here when", "94:34", "you say it's the machine is doing it", "94:36", "mm-hm you know what's the future going", "94:38", "to be like when we can just say it's not", "94:40", "my promise the machine that this is just", "94:42", "Facebook though when when you're talking", "94:44", "about or Google rather when you're we're", "94:46", "talking about Twitter twitter has a", "94:49", "different issue and their issue is", "94:51", "there's accusations of shadow banning", "94:54", "that they have decided that they're", "94:56", "going to silence certain voices or make", "94:58", "them much more difficult to find or", "95:00", "eliminate them from certain people's", "95:02", "feeds you know and they're doing this", "95:05", "this the allegation that they're doing", "95:07", "is based on their own personal", "95:09", "preferences their their beliefs that the", "95:12", "you know their progressive ideology", "95:14", "wants them to lean left and just somehow", "95:19", "another distribute that information and", "95:22", "much more left-leaning way yeah and I", "95:25", "hear these and I don't not an expert on", "95:28", "what they're doing um and I wouldn't be", "95:30", "surprised if you know certain complaints", "95:33", "come in about certain feeds and they say", "95:34", "we're gonna take these off that's the", "95:36", "allegation and they haven't denied that", "95:37", "um and you know quite frankly some of", "95:40", "these like feeds you know Alex Jones", "95:42", "stuff you know if you're the consequence", "95:46", "of your news show is that somebody takes", "95:49", "a gun to a pizza shop and should cut in", "95:51", "in Washington to try to prove that", "95:53", "Hillary Clinton is running a sex slave", "95:55", "operation in the basement there's", "95:57", "something wrong with what's going on", "95:59", "there child sex child sex slave right", "96:01", "yeah so I understand why they feel like", "96:04", "they're responsible there and you know", "96:06", "was recognized from very beginning these", "96:08", "companies have said we're gonna try to", "96:09", "create a certain kind of environment and", "96:11", "like so facebook required you identify", "96:13", "yourself so that under the shadows of", "96:16", "anonymity you wouldn't be causing", "96:17", "wreaking lots of havoc inside the system", "96:19", "but look I think the more fundamental", "96:21", "problem here you know so what I've said", "96:24", "so far people like Google and Facebook", "96:25", "might like here stuff they're gonna hate", "96:27", "the more fundamental problem here is", "96:30", "that we have no antitrust enforcement of", "96:33", "any of these companies against any of", "96:35", "these companies and we've allowed them", "96:36", "to become so incredibly powerful without", "96:40", "any justification under the law well", "96:42", "isn't the issue though that this was", "96:44", "never anticipated that this is now when", "96:46", "they created Twitter they didn't think", "96:48", "of it it's gonna be it's gonna be some", "96:49", "voice of distribution of information", "96:51", "that's unprecedented worldwide but", "96:53", "that's what it is yeah no they didn't", "96:56", "expect no doubt they didn't expect it to", "96:59", "work exactly the way it worked but the", "97:01", "antitrust law has from the beginning had", "97:03", "standards that should have said we need", "97:04", "to step in in certain places so for", "97:06", "example in 2010 Facebook is facing a", "97:10", "pretty powerful competitive threat from", "97:13", "Instagram and the question is what", "97:17", "they're gonna do like it's cooler to be", "97:19", "Instagram it's kids are using it much", "97:21", "the growth rate is much faster in an", "97:24", "ordinary competitive market what they", "97:26", "would do is they would build a better", "97:27", "product to compete with Instagram their", "97:30", "response was to write a check for a", "97:32", "billion dollars and they bought", "97:33", "Instagram", "97:35", "and and they've bought a whole bunch of", "97:37", "other companies including whatsapp which", "97:38", "you know was a very important competitor", "97:41", "you know in people believed a really", "97:42", "secure way to communicate they buy", "97:45", "Boston Dynamics to have a that's amazing", "97:48", "there's a there's a Wikipedia page it", "97:50", "has like endless lists of companies that", "97:52", "they yeah they're buying robots", "97:54", "yeah that makes sense I'm just find out", "97:57", "that's true yeah", "97:59", "but the point is antitrust law in any of", "98:02", "these moments should have and", "98:04", "historically would have stepped in and", "98:06", "said wait a minute wait a minute you", "98:08", "can't buy your way into complete", "98:10", "dominance of these markets and I think", "98:13", "one of the biggest changes that's", "98:15", "happening in the last 20 years is that", "98:17", "the antitrust Department has just shut", "98:20", "up its doors and just stopped doing its", "98:22", "work so if we had a more competitive", "98:25", "internet environment where companies had", "98:30", "to compete against each other you'd have", "98:32", "companies that try to compete by", "98:34", "protecting your privacy differently by", "98:36", "refusing to sell your information", "98:37", "differently you'd have lots of pressure", "98:39", "on companies like Facebook to behave not", "98:41", "because idiots senators who don't know", "98:44", "how Facebook works are calling them", "98:45", "before hearings but because the market", "98:47", "itself is creating the competition that", "98:50", "drives them to behave in a way that", "98:51", "actually conforms with what consumers", "98:52", "want so I agree with you these are real", "98:55", "questions and important questions to", "98:57", "figure out are they biasing in one way", "98:59", "or the other and if they're biasing", "99:01", "systematically that's a really important", "99:03", "problem but the solution to that problem", "99:05", "might not be more government regulation", "99:07", "the solution to that problem might be", "99:09", "government's making sure we have the", "99:10", "right kind of competition going on here", "99:12", "so that they can't get away with", "99:15", "behaving in this bad way well what would", "99:16", "be that right comic is that in fact", "99:18", "Google bought it and they actually sold", "99:20", "it last year Oh interesting probably", "99:23", "sold to the Russians these like what", "99:30", "would be the right kind of competition", "99:32", "it would have to be something that", "99:33", "balances it out right like some sort of", "99:34", "a right-wing social media platform but", "99:38", "those tend to get infested with trolls", "99:40", "and 4chan type people then as soon as", "99:43", "you say we're not gonna have any", "99:45", "regulation I mean the idea would be", "99:47", "right you say", "99:48", "Oh Google and Facebook they are so", "99:51", "progressive they lean left they suppress", "99:53", "conservative voices and they don't", "99:56", "believe in freedom of speech so we're", "99:58", "gonna create a right-wing platform that", "100:01", "allows freedom of speech and doesn't", "100:03", "suppress conservative voices and you", "100:05", "know what happens to those things they", "100:06", "get infested by 4chan people and the", "100:10", "Pepe the Frog people and they start", "100:12", "saying racist things if I could say", "100:13", "anything I'll say anything anything", "100:15", "means anything and that's that's a real", "100:17", "problem in today's day and age because", "100:19", "there's a lot of bored people out there", "100:21", "and they get excited about a platform", "100:23", "where they can say something that they", "100:26", "know is completely outrageous under an", "100:27", "anonymous screen name and people think", "100:30", "well this is indicative of a person's", "100:32", "actual real beliefs yeah sometimes", "100:34", "sometimes it's bored people that are", "100:37", "trying to fuck with people and they're", "100:38", "trying to get a rise out of folks and", "100:40", "they know that if they write a bunch of", "100:42", "n words and Heil Hitler", "100:44", "that it's gonna get a reaction and then", "100:46", "they'll check it every couple minutes to", "100:47", "see what kind of well I look at all", "100:49", "these people getting mad ha ha like this", "100:51", "is what happens so it's incredible", "100:53", "progressive team tends to when you think", "100:57", "of someone as being progressive or", "100:59", "having you know a progressive voice you", "101:02", "tend to think of being inclusive you", "101:04", "know not supporting homophobia being", "101:07", "open to all sorts of different", "101:09", "marginalized groups rights but when you", "101:12", "think of conservative you open the door", "101:14", "for a lot of people that are rejected by", "101:18", "these progressive groups and they might", "101:21", "not necessarily be conservative but they", "101:23", "are not welcome in these progressive", "101:26", "spaces so they come on to these new", "101:28", "places and it turns into a dumpster fire", "101:31", "yeah look the story you just described", "101:34", "is the story of cable television right", "101:37", "so the story of cable television is that", "101:38", "at a certain point people like Robert", "101:40", "Roger Ailes and the Murdock's decided", "101:43", "that we didn't have enough conservative", "101:45", "media out there and so they funded not", "101:48", "just magazines like the New Republic but", "101:50", "they

observations about", "102:02", "this is what you hide then Claire's book", "102:03", "is all about like what the nature of", "102:05", "truth is on cable television", "102:07", "on the right is different from what it", "102:08", "is on the left so I think that's all", "102:11", "fair and I don't think anybody has a", "102:13", "clear sense of what the right answer", "102:16", "look looks like in this space I mean the", "102:19", "reality is you know Facebook is a", "102:21", "technology I mean here the Facebook", "102:23", "friends are gonna really hate me for", "102:24", "this but here Facebook is a technology", "102:26", "to exploit insecurities for the purpose", "102:29", "of selling ads that's what it does what", "102:32", "it does is make you feel like you've", "102:34",
