good for", "05:58", "everybody and it's it's natural and", "06:00", "normal but after it was over it was", "06:02", "nothing but respect", "06:04", "can I kind of pause here yeah leptin is", "06:06", "produced were yeah leptin is produced", "06:08", "yeah let's talk about left in a little", "06:10", "bit it's produced in fat cells and it's", "06:12", "produced in proportion to the size of", "06:15", "fat tissue so the amount of body fat you", "06:17", "have the more fat you have the more", "06:19", "leptin you have in the circulation and", "06:21", "basically what this is it's what's", "06:23", "called a negative feedback loop which is", "06:26", "a really simple engineering term that", "06:28", "works like a thermostat so with your", "06:30", "thermostat you if you set your", "06:34", "thermostat to 70", "06:36", "if it starts getting a little bit of", "06:37", "hotter your AC turns on to bring it back", "06:39", "down this starts getting lower AC comes", "06:42", "on or the heat comes on to bring it up", "06:44", "that's called the negative feedback", "06:46", "system and it maintains the stability of", "06:48", "the temperature of your house we have", "06:51", "many negative feedback loops in the", "06:53", "human body to regulate body temperature", "06:55", "to regulate blood pressure to regulate", "06:58", "all sorts of things one of the negative", "07:00", "feedback loops we have regulates body", "07:02", "fatness and the hormone so your", "07:05", "thermostat measures temperature by using", "07:08", "a thermo stat sorry a thermometer your", "07:12", "brain measures body fatness using this", "07:14", "hormone leptin that's in the circulation", "07:16", "and then particularly when your body fat", "07:19", "level drops your leptin levels drop and", "07:22", "your brain hears that and it kicks in a", "07:25", "starvation response basically and this", "07:27", "is the main reason why weight loss is so", "07:29", "difficult because your brain is like no", "07:31", "I don't want to be losing fat and it", "07:33", "makes you hungrier it increases your yes", "07:36", "is that a certain level of body fat as a", "07:38", "sum so here's just when you're losing", "07:40", "body fat in general like even if you", "07:42", "have a large person that's overweight", "07:44", "recked", "07:44", "when you're losing body fat in general", "07:46", "your body exacerbate your hunger and", "07:49", "this is this is the thing that's really", "07:50", "important to understand about obesity is", "07:53", "that people with obesity have a higher", "07:56", "setpoint so it's like turning your", "07:57", "thermostat from 70 to 80 and then your", "08:00", "thermostats are regulating around 80", "08:02", "people with obesity they're not", "08:04", "regulating around 170 anymore they're", "08:06", "regulating around 250 and so when you", "08:09", "cause a lean person to lose weight you", "08:12", "see the same thing is when you cause a", "08:13", "person with obesity to lose weight you", "08:15", "see this reaction in their brain", "08:18", "circuits that regulate body fatness that", "08:21", "drives them to increase their cravings", "08:23", "and their hunger so metabolic rate drops", "08:25", "so it would be an evolutionary mechanism", "08:27", "to force you to seek food correct and", "08:29", "not just to force you to seek food that", "08:31", "is the main thing but it also slows your", "08:33", "metabolic rate does everything it can to", "08:35", "get more energy in your body and have", "08:37", "less leaving and it keeps doing that", "08:40", "until the fat comes back can I pause", "08:41", "here yeah so when you're eating a sugary", "08:44", "diet a high high calorie diet you will", "08:47", "produce more fat your body will get", "08:49", "fatter", "08:50", "right um it depends on how many calories", "08:52", "you're okay if you're overeating yeah", "08:54", "I'm consuming a lot of sugar a lot of", "08:56", "carbohydrates your body will get fatter", "08:57", "your body will produce more leptin", "08:59", "correct so it comes from the diet", "09:02", "yeah indirectly definitely I was pleased", "09:06", "and I played nine holes of golf with him", "09:08", "was he like and it was well there's", "09:11", "still security Secret Service all around", "09:14", "him right and so it was a private golf", "09:18", "course Larry Ellison that owns Oracle Oh", "09:23", "owns this private golf course it has 14", "09:27", "he's a big tennis guy so he puts on the", "09:28", "tennis stuff out in Palm Springs and", "09:30", "nobody plays this course and he doesn't", "09:32", "play golf and it's just as private as is", "09:36", "the deal his own course cuz yeah he's", "09:38", "got his own courses", "09:39", "he played through our group and Shadow", "09:43", "Creek and Beverly Hill I mean in in", "09:45", "Vegas a really exclusive course", "09:48", "impossible to get on and and he was", "09:50", "playing by himself and he was gone the", "09:52", "tea box and I said it's lonely at the", "09:54", "top in Hilaire he goes yeah I went off", "09:58", "by himself but he went even there but", "10:01", "but Clinton was and he told me a story", "10:04", "goes his friend of his is a record", "10:06", "producer rap records big didn't tell me", "10:08", "who it was and didn't tell me who the", "10:10", "artist was either but the artist was all", "10:11", "dug down he was in a Ferrari store and", "10:13", "and the salesman goes are you thinking", "10:17", "about buying this car and the guy goes", "10:19", "no I'm gonna buy the car I'm thinking", "10:21", "about pussy the Clinton told me a story", "10:28", "that had the word pussy in it", "10:32", "Clinton told me that that's a great", "10:35", "fucking story so so Nietzsche and", "10:38", "Schopenhauer talked about the idea that", "10:39", "there's the will right so as a human", "10:41", "being you're stuck in this fucking I", "10:43", "gotta eat", "10:44", "I gotta fuck I gotta sleep and I got a", "10:46", "breed and I eat and I sleep and I'm", "10:48", "fucked so I can breed you know and I can", "10:50", "stay alive and then might you know", "10:51", "further my gene pool and you're stuck in", "10:54", "this kind of like will to live there's", "10:56", "there but there is a respite and that", "10:58", "rest by this
