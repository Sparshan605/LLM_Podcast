i was um", "06:52", "i think i was 27 the first time i ever", "06:54", "got online", "06:55", "and that's a that's nice you know and no", "06:58", "one knew what online was back then you", "06:59",

"07:18", "and then i literally said to oh that's", "07:19", "never going to catch on come on that's", "07:20", "like", "07:21", "really yeah wow yeah isn't that what", "07:24", "they said about the first computers", "07:26", "like that was one of ibm's initial", "07:28", "reactions to the idea of the personal", "07:30", "computer", "07:32", "i think that's the reaction to the first", "07:33",

"07:40", "but everything else", "07:41", "i think that's you know skepticism like", "07:43", "we don't we don't need anything more", "07:44", "we're good", "07:45", "and then you realize i mean that's the", "07:47", "amazing thing about the human mind", "07:49", "is that we invent this stuff and it", "07:51", "doesn't mean that it's good i mean we", "07:52", "evolved over hundreds of thousands of", "07:54", "years to live a very different", "07:55", "environment that we live now", "07:56", "so these things that we invent it", "07:58", "doesn't mean that they're sort of", "08:00",

good for us but i don't think", "08:09", "this is going to sound weird but i don't", "08:10", "even think they're necessarily designed", "08:12", "for us", "08:12", "i think they're designed for the future", "08:14", "i think and i don't even think it's a", "08:16", "design", "08:16", "i just think that all things move in an", "08:18", "ever more complex direction", "08:20", "and that whatever a person is now is not", "08:23", "going to be the same thing a thousand", "08:24", "years from now or a hundred years from", "08:25", "now", "08:26", "even i think there's going to be some", "08:27", "sort of symbiotic connection between us", "08:29", "and", "08:29", "electronics like we're going to have it", "08:31", "installed in our bodies", "08:33", "well you know that gets to um a kind of", "08:36", "profound question like what is the point", "08:38", "of existence", "08:38", "of human existence what's the point of", "08:40", "it um is the point", "08:42", "for as many humans as possible to leave", "08:44", "to lead safe", "08:46", "um human fulfilled lives or is it for", "08:50", "the human race as an entity", "08:52", "to produce the highest technological", "08:53", "achievements and scientific insights you", "08:55", "know", "08:56", "and i don't have a vote either way but", "08:58", "that that does sort of", "08:59", "seem to be the the question and that", "09:02", "technology", "09:03", "i mean we know does not lead to", "09:04", "fulfillment and happiness but it does", "09:06", "lead to scientific insight and to", "09:08", "you know incredible um under i mean", "09:11", "profound understanding of how the", "09:12", "universe works in a physical sense", "09:14", "yeah i wonder if what we're doing is", "09:16", "just being caught up in the momentum", "09:18", "of all this innovation and instead of", "09:21", "like", "09:22", "using discipline or using some sort of a", "09:26", "rational objective analysis of like what", "09:29", "it takes to be happy", "09:30", "and then maybe pushing pushing some of", "09:33", "that stuff aside", "09:34", "and engaging in actual physical", "09:36", "activities going out and doing things", "09:37", "and", "09:38", "and making that almost like a", "09:39", "prescription like hey you know", "09:41", "look let's look at your daily chart hey", "09:43", "you don't you didn't get enough vitamins", "09:44", "buddy", "09:44", "and hey you didn't get enough activity", "09:46", "like you need you need that in order to", "09:48", "be", "09:49", "in order to feel right to feel feel", "09:51", "balanced", "09:52", "right and if feeling right is the point", "09:54", "of existence then", "09:56", "iphones are probably not a good", "09:57", "development no right if the exchange of", "09:59", "data", "10:00", "if the exchange of information uh is the", "10:03", "point", "10:04", "then then they're a great innovation so", "10:05", "it really depends on what we're all here", "10:07", "for i", "10:07", "i was in san francisco with my wife and", "10:10", "um we were walking behind these two kids", "10:12", "who were talking about about robots and", "10:14", "one was saying they were sort of geek", "10:15", "kids i was sort of", "10:16", "sort of in the know about all this stuff", "10:17", "and one guy was saying you know they're", "10:19", "taking over you know in 50 years", "10:21", "you know we're we're going to be humans", "10:23", "are going to be completely unnecessary", "10:25", "and i said to my wife you know we always", "10:27", "were unnecessary", "10:29", "like none of this had to happen it's not", "10:30", "like the world needs human beings to", "10:32", "exist and for some", "10:33", "purpose right we just we are here um but", "10:36", "we didn't have to be here", "10:38", "and so if robots replace us we go right", "10:40", "back to where we would have been if we", "10:42", "hadn't", "10:42", "if we hadn't um evolved yeah", "10:46", "and it was it was just a funny way of", "10:47", "thinking about it like none of this is", "10:48", "actually necessary it doesn't have to be", "10:50", "happening", "10:51", "no it certainly doesn't i mean look if", "10:52", "we are finite life forms if you're only", "10:54", "going to", "10:54", "live to be you know if you're lucky 90", "10:57", "years and", "10:58", "when your health's going to fail and", "10:59", "then you're going to die what the what", "11:01", "should be", "11:02", "our goal is to feel good right to have", "11:06", "community in relation that's a big part", "11:08", "of that book tribe you're", "11:09", "your book's fantastic by the way i've", "11:11", "read it twice since i read it", "11:12", "again i read it before and then i read", "11:14", "it again since uh since our", "11:17", "first podcast oh thank you very much", "11:18", "yeah i've been getting a lot of", "11:20", "i keep getting a lot of good responses", "11:21", "to it and you know i think partly", "11:23", "i mean whether you're a democrat or", "11:25", "republican this is a pretty unsettling", "11:27", "time in this country", "11:28", "and um and i you know i think people are", "11:30", "coming to the book a little bit just", "11:31", "partly because they're wondering what is", "11:35", "the glue that holds us all together and", "11:36", "is there", "11:37", "does that exist still like i mean i", "11:39", "think there's a real question in", "11:40", "people's minds about what is it that", "11:41", "binds us together", "11:42", "well there certainly is and you really", "11:44", "covered a lot of the", "11:46", "sort of just not", "11:49", "commonly discussed aspects of it like", "11:52", "the need for real community the need to", "11:55", "really and", "11:56", "the need to have something on the line", "12:01", "you know the need to be in situations", "12:03", "where there's real consequences", "12:05", "and that it seems that this is part of", "12:07", "the glue that holds us together", "12:09", "well i mean the thing about technology", "12:10", "is it buffers us from real consequences", "12:12", "in the physical world which is what's", "12:14", "great about it", "12:15", "right and uh but the downside", "12:18", "is that as you as humans get buffered", "12:20", "from consequences they need", "12:21", "they need each other less and less in", "12:23", "order to survive so now", "12:24", "sort of modern modern homo sapiens in a", "12:26", "suburban house with an iphone and a", "12:28", "garage door opener and all that stuff", "12:30", "you know you get a paycheck at work and", "12:32", "you don't need your neighbors", "12:33", "you know to to help you gather food or", "12:36", "hunt food or defend yourself from the", "12:38", "gang from the other neighborhood i mean", "12:40", "it all kind of gets taken care of which", "12:41", "is a great liberation", "12:43", "from your neighbors from your community", "12:46", "but", "12:46", "it deprives you of that essential human", "12:49", "reliance on other people around you", "12:52", "that's what makes people feel good", "12:53", "and safe and like they're leading", "12:55", "meaningful lives and so", "12:58", "with that transition to having a life", "13:00", "that's not part of", "13:01", "any community that is a really tough one", "13:05", "for people and i think that's part of", "13:06", "the reason for high depression rates and", "13:08", "such", "13:09", "and high ptsd rates in our society yeah", "13:11", "i think that lack of community is a very", "13:13", "confusing thing when you see most people", "13:15", "just sliding into their garage and", "13:17", "shutting the door or going into their", "13:18", "house and they don't even know their", "13:19", "neighbors", "13:20", "how that then that's really highlighted", "13:22", "in your book how", "13:24", "alien that is to the human experience", "13:25", "until fairly recently", "13:27", "like this idea of like living in these", "13:30", "in like i was in new york city this past", "13:32", "weekend and", "13:32", "this enormous apartment like my friend", "13:35", "jim was talking about this", "13:36", "he lived jim norton lives in this",

is either", "24:42", "the final blossoming of the human mind", "24:44", "or it's the end and i don't think anyone", "24:46", "knows which it is", "24:47", "it could easily be the end i've been",

it now", "25:04", "and then i mean we we assume that the", "25:08", "things that we hold dear like emotions", "25:10", "and camaraderie and", "25:11", "this feeling that we have of community", "25:13", "that that's important", "25:15", "but if we live and we die", "25:18", "like it's important to us while we're", "25:20", "alive but would if we didn't exist", "25:22", "is it important in

extremely", "25:41", "unlikely", "25:43", "um that even the universe would exist", "25:45", "yeah yeah yeah", "25:46", "and um so it's hard to", "25:50", "say that anything would be important", "25:52", "right", "25:53", "to a system that that", "25:57", "uh statistically shouldn't have happened", "25:59", "and that doesn't have a conscious and", "26:01", "moral mind behind it like i mean no of", "26:03", "course we're not important", "26:05", "i mean if we were sitting on the moon", "26:06", "and you watched a nuclear exchange", "26:08", "between russia and the united states", "26:09",

that's the moon and that's", "26:18", "pretty close of course it doesn't matter", "26:19", "yeah", "26:19", "so keep in mind that all those emotions", "26:23", "everything we are", "26:25", "had survival value in our past or we", "26:27", "that we wouldn't have those things", "26:29", "right we're the legacy of an", "26:32", "evolutionary process that went on for", "26:33", "two million years", "26:35", "so if we feel sadness if we feel anger", "26:38", "if we feel shame all of those things had", "26:41", "survived survival value for humans", "26:43", "and and the individuals that had the", "26:45", "capacity for those emotions", "26:47", "made better citizens within their little", "26:49", "community we're better hunters we're", "26:51", "better whatever", "26:52", "and so those emotions we find them", "26:56", "meaningful but actually what they are is", "26:58", "they they helped us survive", "27:00", "and now we have so altered our", "27:03", "circumstances that survival is no longer", "27:06", "a question", "27:07", "and so what do we do with those feelings", "27:09", "what do we do with those capacities", "27:11", "the ability to hunt the the dopamine", "27:14", "that you get from hitting a target", "27:15", "i mean teenage boys will sit in a", "27:18", "basement for", "27:18", "hours days years playing video games", "27:21", "they're practice they're training for", "27:22", "hunting right", "27:23", "they're training for hunting in war and", "27:24", "they're getting rewarded with dopamine", "27:26", "which is exactly what should have been", "27:28", "happening for 500 000 years", "27:30", "and now there's nothing to hunt nothing", "27:32", "to fight they're still doing the", "27:33", "behavior as they should because they're",

"27:54", "our relationship with our community and", "27:56", "with society right and and i mean at", "27:58", "least if you play sports you're part of", "28:01", "you you're part of the human community", "28:03", "and and when you're in", "28:05", "you know when you're playing a video", "28:06", "game by yourself you're really not by", "28:08", "yourself but a lot of kids what they're", "28:09", "doing now is they're playing these", "28:11", "online games they're playing", "28:12", "against other people they talk to each", "28:14", "other online they have like headsets and", "28:17", "they i mean esports is a big", "28:20", "growing thing and it's uh i mean it's", "28:23", "it's a fascinating thing because it's", "28:24", "also", "28:25", "sort of based on your ability to perform", "28:28", "you know the", "28:28", "the ones who are the heroes or the ones", "28:30", "who are like um when i was playing quake", "28:32", "there was this dude named", "28:34", "fatality was his uh his name he just", "28:36", "killed everybody he was awesome", "28:38", "but it was you know he was the", "28:41", "he was the king because he was just the", "28:43", "best at the game so in the community of", "28:45", "people that were only judged by their", "28:47", "performance", "28:48", "he had risen to this very high level but", "28:50", "it was a community", "28:52", "well you know if you look at humans you", "28:53", "look at chimpanzees we clearly need the", "28:55", "proximity of others like the physical", "28:56", "proximity of others so", "28:58", "i mean the only way i can evaluate that", "29:00", "is to say that's an", "29:01", "that's awesome training for hunting in", "29:03", "war right", "29:04", "and the military does use those games to", "29:06", "train their soldiers", "29:07", "and so i get it it's effective what i", "29:10", "would do is look at suicide and", "29:11", "depression rates in gamers", "29:13", "and see are they above or below the", "29:14",

is", "29:31", "but that's that's where i would look now", "29:32", "when you're researching all this data", "29:34", "and you're putting together a book like", "29:35", "tribe and you're", "29:36",

would", "36:40", "be absolutely", "36:41", "furious if they thought someone was", "36:42", "faking their symptoms", "36:44", "and that that they had to be physically", "36:46", "restrained to keep

"combat", "37:51", "how would they know if someone was", "37:53", "seriously traumatized and", "37:55", "the other thing that's fascinating is", "37:56", "that as you were talking about in", "37:58",

like", "38:08", "egalitarian ideas are", "38:10", "much more much more openly expressed", "38:13", "it's much more important", "38:15", "that this is represented by these people", "38:18", "that are",

and you lost your", "38:43", "best buddy", "38:45", "and you got trauma from that as well you", "38:47", "should um", "38:48", "and then you're in some group therapy", "38:50", "thing at the va with some guy who was on", "38:51", "a rear base the whole time and is", "38:53", "claiming", "38:54", "100 ptsd disability for something that", "38:56", "never happened like yeah", "38:58", "that would make you angry it would make", "38:59", "me angry you know because combat is is", "39:01", "extremely emotional and", "39:03", "again i don't know is it one in a", "39:04", "million one in a hundred one thousand i", "39:06", "have no idea what the rates are", "39:08", "i'm not even sure what the if the va", "39:09", "does and there's there's", "39:11", "you know in some ways incentivize not to", "39:12", "find out but but", "39:14", "it's i'm i can tell you from like the", "39:16", "real deal combat vets that happens", "39:18", "they smell it instantly and one way it", "39:21", "gets", "39:21", "sorted out is that those guys who are", "39:24", "misrepresenting themselves get", "39:25", "questioned by the combat vets oh so what", "39:27", "uni were you with", "39:28", "like he said what happened exactly oh a", "39:30", "mortar hit the other side of the base", "39:31", "that's a pretty big base i've been there", "39:32", "you know i was a mile away and you're", "39:34", "traumatized are you kidding", "39:36", "like you know i mean they'll get", "39:37", "questioned right right um", "39:40", "so i mean like you might question", "39:41", "someone who's bullshitting you about how", "39:42", "much", "39:43", "you know how much uh fighting he's done", "39:45", "with the mma or", "39:46", "i don't know whatever you know whatever", "39:47", "your area of expertise is i'm sure you", "39:49", "can smell a fraud instantly right yeah", "39:51", "well everyone can that's one of the", "39:53", "things", "39:54", "that's one of the characteristics of", "39:55", "humans is that because we live in", "39:57", "collective societies where we have to", "39:59", "sort of trust one another we're", "40:00", "extremely good at smelling out", "40:02", "misrepresentation and fraud we're really", "40:03", "really good at it", "40:05", "um and it's one of the things that feels", "40:07", "intolerable", "40:08", "is to have someone who was unfairly gain", "40:11", "gaining", "40:12", "from the hard work of the rest of us and", "40:14", "right and and i should just say", "40:16", "when i say egalitarianism i don't mean", "40:18", "that there's no hierarchy", "40:19", "right right i mean complicated systems", "40:22", "need", "40:23", "hierarchy need order right need heart i", "40:24", "mean groups need hierarchies so that", "40:26", "not everyone's a general not everyone's", "40:28", "a private i mean you need organization", "40:30", "within the group", "40:31", "but um egalitarian means that nobody", "40:34", "gets extra rights", "40:36", "you know like we all have the basically", "40:38", "the same rights in the group that's what", "40:39", "that means", "40:41", "well it i mean it all completely makes", "40:44", "sense", "40:44", "it particularly makes sense the idea", "40:46", "that these people who were", "40:48", "real combat vets who saw real action", "40:50", "would be", "40:51", "instantaneously able to discern whether", "40:53", "or not someone was faking it", "40:55", "yeah and this but that this it sort of", "40:58", "mirrors what you're saying about these", "41:00", "small tribes that in these small tribes", "41:02", "someone who's a freeloader", "41:03", "is uh extremely dangerous to the group", "41:06", "like", "41:06", "you're looked at as a liability you", "41:08", "looked at as someone who", "41:10", "just can't be trusted and you need trust", "41:13", "yeah you need community and this is this", "41:15", "is like what you're saying about", "41:16", "uh combat troops that what they want to", "41:20", "know is that you're going to be", "41:21", "willing to put your own safety secondary", "41:24", "to the safety of the troop right and and", "41:27", "if everyone does that everyone's safer", "41:29", "but if", "41:30", "no one if some one person doesn't do", "41:32", "that i mean that's always in the movies", "41:34", "right it's always the one guy", "41:35", "who runs away or the one guy who sells", "41:38", "out or", "41:39", "yeah that's right and you know those", "41:42", "those human themes are enduring and very", "41:44", "powerful so sometimes i speak to a lot", "41:45", "of liberal audiences right and uh", "41:48", "and so i i love doing this to them like", "41:50", "and i'm a democrat so i sort of know", "41:52", "those people pretty well right i grew up", "41:54", "in massachusetts and i get it you know", "41:55", "and so", "41:56", "uh you know i'll say to them okay who", "41:58", "here is against war and doesn't want to", "41:59", "know anything", "42:00", "have anything to do with war and of", "42:03", "course everyone raises their hand right", "42:04", "and um and then i say okay", "42:08", "who here has paid money to go be", "42:10", "entertained by a hollywood war movie", "42:12", "and everyone raises their hand it seems", "42:14", "like a contradiction but what then i go", "42:16", "on to say to them is look", "42:17", "if if if war can get a room full of", "42:20", "pacifists to go pay money", "42:22", "to watch it is there something important", "42:24", "going on", "42:25", "in that narrative yeah it's not you're", "42:28", "not going", "42:29", "to the movies to watch people get killed", "42:31", "right you're not", "42:32", "you guys aren't all sociopaths you're", "42:34", "going to the movies to see these", "42:36", "very ancient

things that", "42:46", "have kept", "42:47", "humans alive or endangered them as the", "42:49", "case may be", "42:51", "for a million years of course they're", "42:53", "compelling narratives and in war", "42:55", "you see those things happen like in a", "42:57", "sort of accelerated intense", "43:00", "rate i mean that you know you grew up in", "43:01", "a suburb you almost never", "43:03", "see someone have to choose between their", "43:04", "own safety and the community it never", "43:06", "happens that's the problem with the", "43:07", "suburbs", "43:08", "in war that happens every moment every", "43:10", "day right so so", "43:12", "it gives you this sort of like human", "43:14", "narrative in this incredibly compressed", "43:16", "intense form", "43:17", "which reconfirms the value the human", "43:19", "values we all have about okay if you're", "43:21", "in a group", "43:22", "you you have to love that group even if", "43:25", "you're if you dislike some of the people", "43:27", "in it like that's what it means to be", "43:28", "part of a group and that's what has kept", "43:30", "humans alive for a very long time", "43:32", "you even see that narrative in science", "43:34", "fiction futuristic movies like the", "43:36", "matrix", "43:37", "right the one guy who sells out the the", "43:39", "the other humans to the to the matrix", "43:41", "and", "43:42", "just says look i want you know i want to", "43:44", "be in the matrix i want to have a great", "43:45", "life and eat good food and", "43:48", "yeah i mean listen once you once you are", "43:49", "aware of this narrative you see it", "43:51", "everywhere", "43:52", "and i mean one part so some research", "43:54", "that i did that didn't actually make it", "43:56", "into the book i couldn't quite fit it in", "43:57", "but i", "43:58", "i i um interviewed someone who um", "44:01", "had a consulting firm in hollywood that", "44:03", "did basically sort of like", "44:05", "market research for the big studios and", "44:08", "they would", "44:09", "they would screen films for audiences", "44:12", "and then ask the audiences questions", "44:15", "about the ending about the characters", "44:16", "about how to

up i'd walk around the table", "82:36", "right put him in a headlock and i drag", "82:38", "him out of my house", "82:39", "right right i don't want to think that", "82:40", "about my president right i want my", "82:42", "president to be someone i'd be", "82:44", "like glad to have at my dinner table i", "82:46", "would have i didn't vote for george bush", "82:47", "but i'd love to have that guy at my", "82:49", "dinner table", "82:50", "ronald reagan did it you know what i", "82:51", "mean like he's the first president i", "82:53", "mean like no man", "82:54", "i don't want to subject my my friends to", "82:56", "that you ever read woody arrow uh woody", "82:58", "harrelson's account of uh dinner that he", "83:00", "had with trump", "83:01", "no he said literally he had to get up in",

had a dinner with trump and he said", "83:11", "he never met someone so narcissistic", "83:13", "so self-obsessed yeah and you know the", "83:16", "you know my worry", "83:17", "like in this conversation is that it", "83:19", "will somehow seem", "83:20", "partisan and like i would be saying the", "83:23", "same things if trump were a democrat", "83:24", "well you said something about george", "83:25", "bush that you would be happy to have him", "83:27", "over", "83:27", "i just think i hope that what comes out", "83:30", "of this is that a hero will rise", "83:32", "and that someone will someone who's", "83:34", "really a legitimately good person", "83:36", "will say look this is a this is a", "83:38", "fucking travesty like some", "83:40", "someone who actually could assume the", "83:42", "role correctly will step into place", "83:44", "and it will see that very clearly in", "83:46", "comparison right", "83:48", "well what i mean to get back to your", "83:49", "question one of the solutions that i", "83:51", "talk about it's not in my book but when", "83:53", "i talk about this is national", "83:55", "compulsory national service with a with", "83:58", "a military option", "83:59", "and your question was how do we make", "84:01", "this nation feel like a nation", "84:03", "right right and the problem", "84:04", "psychologists will tell you", "84:06", "that the more you sacrifice for", "84:08", "something the more you value it", "84:10", "right and if if you're part of something", "84:11", "that doesn't require any sacrifice at", "84:13", "all you just don't value it very", "84:15", "highly right the advantage of national", "84:17", "service", "84:18", "it and i don't mean the draft i think i", "84:21", "don't mean", "84:22", "military service i mean national service", "84:24", "with the military option i don't think", "84:25", "it's moral to force someone to fight a", "84:26", "war that they don't believe in", "84:28", "what sort of service would you you know", "84:30", "whatever whatever it is the nation needs", "84:32", "a lot of stuff done", "84:33", "right and and whatever that may be but", "84:36", "the point of it is so if you had a", "84:38", "military option but otherwise you could", "84:40", "teach in schools otherwise you could", "84:42", "dig ditches i don't whatever the nation", "84:43", "needs done this", "84:45", "work this core of workers at 22 23 years", "84:48", "old", "84:49", "does it for a year my first wife was", "84:51", "from from the eastern from eastern", "84:53", "europe", "84:54", "and the young people formed work", "84:57", "brigades in the summer", "84:58", "and and helped harvest like harvest", "84:59", "wheat and stuff like that was what she", "85:01", "did", "85:02", "when she was a teenage girl and it was", "85:04", "incredibly good", "85:05", "for the kids over there and it made them", "85:08", "feel like they're part of something", "85:09", "right", "85:09", "and so what what i would say there's a", "85:12", "downside to national service which is", "85:14", "the government's telling people what to", "85:15", "do", "85:16", "of course there's also an upside which", "85:18", "is it makes everyone feel like they're", "85:19", "part of this thing", "85:21", "called the united states and it puts", "85:23", "white people and black people everyone", "85:25", "puts them all into a big pot and stirs", "85:26", "them up just like the military does and", "85:28", "they get to know each other and", "85:30", "so everything's there's an upside and a", "85:33", "downside to everything", "85:34", "right so national service has a very", "85:36", "obvious downside but the upside isn't", "85:38", "discussed much which is", "85:40", "that it creates an american identity", "85:43", "a shared experience that all americans", "85:46", "have", "85:47", "that they like in israel this compulsory", "85:49", "service and", "85:50", "that is a common ground that

would be nice if people", "86:09", "did have some i mean if you if you", "86:12", "some sort of connection to what it takes", "86:15", "to keep things running", "86:16", "whether it's help fix the streets", "86:18", "whether it's", "86:19", "you know help do something but the the", "86:22", "problem that i would have it", "86:23", "probably i would have with it is the", "86:25", "idea that someone from the government", "86:27", "would be able to require you to do", "86:28", "something", "86:29", "and that if you didn't do it they could", "86:30", "treat you the same way the irs treats",

listen i mean listen for", "86:52", "most of this nation's history we've had", "86:54", "a draft", "86:55", "that's the government telling people", "86:56", "what to do right", "86:58", "and likewise

that would be something that would", "88:11", "be", "88:12", "a fascinating debate to have back and", "88:14", "forth i just wonder if people", "88:16", "at any point in their lives today would",

good", "94:48", "yeah and the things that are dangerous", "94:51", "to us uh and and lessen our chance for", "94:54", "survival", "94:55", "don't feel good so being isolated being", "94:59",

"95:26", "and is reinforced", "95:28", "and and creativity factors onto that how", "95:31", "that like say like art like painting or", "95:33", "something like that like there's", "95:34", "something", "95:35", "deeply satisfying to people that are", "95:36", "painters well yeah and what they're", "95:38", "i mean art um they know from the from", "95:41", "the incredible paintings", "95:43", "on the caves and in the caves in france", "95:46", "and spain let's go and the other caves", "95:48", "um that art is one of the things that's", "95:51", "used to bind", "95:52", "communities together in ceremonies i", "95:54", "mean you can see in church i mean", "95:56", "there's no there is no church in the", "95:57", "land that doesn't have art on the walls", "95:59", "right right um the depictions of christ", "96:02", "or whatever or what one of the visual", "96:04", "aids that helps bind people into a group", "96:06", "like oh we all believe in the same thing", "96:07", "right", "96:08", "so art is a great binding force music is", "96:10", "an incredible binding force", "96:12", "so rhythmic like rhythm a heavy drumming", "96:14", "rhythm will get a whole group of people", "96:16", "sort of moving in unison um and", "96:20", "jonathan hate has talked about i talked", "96:22", "about that sort of hive behavior and how", "96:24", "it works and", "96:25", "very very powerful so what i would say", "96:28", "and i'm just guessing here but i would", "96:30", "say is that the arts that are so", "96:31", "intoxicating to be engaged in", "96:33", "their survival value is that it makes", "96:36", "the group cohere around a unified idea", "96:39", "and the music does that um the visual", "96:42", "arts do that", "96:43", "um the spoken word poetry song all those", "96:46", "do that as well and so that's you have a", "96:48", "group of people", "96:49", "that are that are unified on these all", "96:51", "all these different levels", "96:53", "so what happens when the enemy comes i", "96:55", "mean the music starts", "96:56", "the sort of like visual pageantry starts", "96:59", "like and you get you know like the", "97:01", "you know the wartime posters showing", "97:02", "heroic soldiers with rifle and bayonet", "97:04", "right you get the art", "97:05", "the war art right you get the marshall", "97:07", "music all of that", "97:08", "galvanizes the public spirit to face the", "97:11", "enemy and it works extremely well", "97:13", "wow so you think that that's one of the", "97:15", "reasons why art is so satisfying", "97:17", "i mean i just assume that our evolution", "97:21", "has produced", "97:22", "that anything that feels good to us had", "97:25", "survival value in our past so if", "97:26", "creating art feels good", "97:29", "that's because we are genetically", "97:31", "predisposed towards doing things that", "97:33", "bind the", "97:34", "group together generosity feels good", "97:36", "right if you walk down the street and", "97:37", "you give someone five dollars you're", "97:39", "just a random dude you just give him", "97:40", "five bucks", "97:41", "and you measure the the neural chemicals", "97:43", "in his brain and your brain", "97:45", "you get more of a high than he does", "97:47", "right so generosity feels good it's", "97:49", "clearly adaptive and helps groups cohere", "97:52", "right yeah and art as well", "97:55", "so that art like when you create", "97:57", "something amazing what you're realizing", "97:59", "is that someone's going to see that and", "98:00", "go", "98:00", "wow that's incredible like they're going", "98:02", "to get a great feeling off of seeing", "98:04", "your art", "98:05", "yeah you have the same vision right like", "98:07", "oh i painted that tree", "98:08", "and this other person or that antelope", "98:10", "or that bison or whatever you find in", "98:12", "the walls of lasko", "98:13", "and this other person comes like oh my", "98:15", "god that's an incredible bison there's", "98:17", "no", "98:17", "like you did something that the other", "98:19", "person connected to", "98:20", "now you the two of you are joined in", "98:22", "your understanding of what that", "98:24", "painting means right and that's a very", "98:27", "powerful thing so if you drew that bison", "98:29", "and no one else", "98:30", "in the world ever saw it i'm guessing", "98:33", "that the chemical rewards for that", "98:35", "creativity", "98:37", "would be less will be lower yeah i you", "98:39", "know i noticed that in my children my", "98:41", "kids love to draw and one of the things", "98:42", "that they love is showing their drawings", "98:44", "i mean they love to draw but like not", "98:45", "yet not yet not yet and then when", "98:47", "they're done like", "98:48", "look that's right and then they're just", "98:50", "like boom they did they're getting that", "98:51", "little rush themselves and you get the", "98:53", "rush and", "98:54", "i mean look i mean just do it it's easy", "98:57", "to", "98:58", "test like take a musician measure their", "99:00", "neurochemicals while they're practicing", "99:02", "in a room by themselves and then put", "99:03", "them in a", "99:04", "in a stadium filled with 10 000 people", "99:06", "and see what happens right", "99:07", "i'm guessing that the guy yeah in the", "99:09", "stadium with bruce springsteen in front", "99:11", "of 10 000 people is experiencing a", "99:13", "neurochemical reality", "99:15", "that he's not getting in his living room", "99:17", "not only that", "99:18", "probably a neurochemical reality that", "99:20", "very few human beings will ever", "99:21", "experience", "99:22", "that's right some sort of a strange", "99:25", "but think about the power of that i mean", "99:27", "you know any musician on space", "99:28", "on stage is basically acting sort of in", "99:30", "the role of the shaman yeah right", "99:32", "like i'm going to act i'm going to act", "99:34", "as a um", "99:35", "conduit between you all and the divine", "99:39", "right and my music is going to do it my", "99:40", "words are going to do it my dancing is",

like", "99:57", "how do you get 10 000 people do the same", "99:58", "thing", "99:59", "at the same time you sing them a song", "100:01", "it's the only way to do it", "100:02", "that's an incredibly powerful thing and", "100:04", "that's the", "100:05", "i mean that's the power of the shaman i", "100:07", "mean bruce springsteen isn't a shaman", "100:09", "literally but he occupies that space", "100:11", "in a modern secular secular society", "100:13", "doesn't have shamans but", "100:14", "but in the old days that's what he would", "100:16", "be do you feel that way when you put a",

feeling that you get or that's all", "100:25", "these people are going to read", "100:26", "it's an interesting thing about a book", "100:28", "because you actually never", "100:30", "observe in real

certain kind of", "109:52", "community", "109:53", "right it doesn't happen in high crime", "109:55", "low income communities", "109:57", "right it happens in the most sort of", "109:59", "like small", "110:00", "quiet christian low crime bland suburban", "110:04", "or rural communities that's where it", "110:06", "happened so what does it say", "110:08", "why is it that these communities are not", "110:11", "producing crazy people but somehow", "110:13", "those people um come to a place where", "110:17", "they think this is a good thing to do", "110:19", "like", "110:19", "why is that happening my theory is that", "110:23", "the the deep alienation of the suburbs", "110:27", "of small town america the la", "110:30", "the lack of um real community", "110:34", "effort and the lack of

have happened over the last two", "111:07", "decades with", "111:09", "uh all the different medications that", "111:10", "people were on and every single one of", "111:12", "them was on something", "111:14", "or was withdrawing from something okay", "111:16", "so there's here's the question", "111:18", "are the drugs creating the behavior or", "111:20", "the drugs", "111:21", "treating a mental disorder", "111:24", "that itself is tied to the behavior very", "111:26", "good question right i mean", "111:28", "there's no way to know the mass", "111:29", "shootings of the nihilistic sort that", "111:31", "i'm referring to", "111:32", "started abrupt abruptly rose in the", "111:36", "80s okay", "111:39", "and then doubled since 2006", "111:42", "and i think they're increasing even more", "111:44", "since then so", "111:46", "every mass shooting over the last 20", "111:47", "years has one thing in common and it", "111:49", "isn't guns", "111:50", "yeah this is it right but that's not",

society i mean that's just", "112:18", "statistically true unquestionably the", "112:20", "question uh that i would have about this", "112:22", "though is that when i've talked to psych", "112:24", "a

"114:01", "there's a tv program called active", "114:03", "shooter", "114:03", "right like and they go back i just heard", "114:06", "about it i haven't seen it i", "114:07", "would never watch it but

are i think partly the result of", "114:24", "the kind of deep alienation that happens", "114:27", "in a in a media obsessed society that", "114:29", "where no one's talking to each other you", "114:30", "know i mean it's a perfect circle right", "114:32", "like", "114:33", "well they're definitely escalating right", "114:34", "i mean we had the event in new york", "114:36", "where the guy runs over all those people", "114:37", "and then a couple of days later", "114:39", "we're having the one in in texas like", "114:41", "this is this is happening", "114:42", "not over the scale of one a year one", "114:44", "every few years we're getting them", "114:46", "once a week well yeah and what's", "114:48", "interesting i mean", "114:49", "in new york there was an ideology behind", "114:51", "it so it wasn't nihilistic i mean it", "114:53", "felt nihilistic to us", "114:55", "but to that guy he actually believed in", "114:56", "what he was doing", "114:58", "but the real mass

person do something", "115:39", "like that i mean shot babies", "115:41", "you know he shot five-year-olds and the", "115:44", "whole thing is just", "115:45", "it doesn't even make sense and i don't", "115:47", "know if he was on a psych medication or", "115:49", "if they know he was", "115:51", "but you know just the staggering numbers", "115:53", "of broken individuals that are",
