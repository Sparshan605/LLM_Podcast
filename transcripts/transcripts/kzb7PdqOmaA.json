"25:20", "it would require demesne amount of power", "25:22", "but just think about it what powers your", "25:24", "cell phone today and what was like to", "25:27", "have those you know Apollo 11 computers", "25:29", "when they filled entire room", "25:31", "and they weren't nearly as powerful as", "25:33", "your cell phone right and your cell", "25:35", "phone", "25:35", "it's not even

blast it - neutrinos or", "25:45", "something and the neutrinos were they", "25:48", "reached where they were supposed to", "25:49", "reach a few milliseconds before they", "25:52", "should have reached it or something", "25:53", "that's a huge question so let's let's", "25:54", "look it up on Google because I'm not the", "25:56", "person to answer this and also I don't", "25:58", "think they've totally confirmed it yet", "26:00", "oh I think a lot of people are still", "26:01", "saying that there's a high likelihood", "26:03", "for some kind of error and the", "26:05", "experiment of course and well", "26:06", "everybody's gonna say that anyway when", "26:07", "something's that crazy yeah no you know", "26:10", "when someone says uh I figured out", "26:11", "time-traveling bitch did you figure out", "26:13", "Luisito papers you didn't figure out", "26:14", "time trust me a paper bitch yeah I was", "26:16", "thinking about time travel if there", "26:18", "really was a time traveler then they", "26:21", "could follow somebody by walking in", "26:23", "front of them wow that's uh yeah cuz you", "26:27", "would know where they were going already", "26:29", "so you could walk in front of them on", "26:31", "what everybody has to have like a really", "26:32", "fucking detailed list of all the shit", "26:34", "that's already gone down you'd have to", "26:36", "see it you'd have to send a time probe", "26:37", "back first to like watch them and watch", "26:39", "the whole world observe whoever you want", "26:41", "to run out of time you die you die of", "26:43", "old age no if you want it you can sit", "26:48", "you could like it you know if you wanted", "26:49", "to observe like Thomas Jefferson or", "26:51", "something right which would be", "26:53", "incredible yeah right to get real videos", "26:56", "of the founding fathers who would you go", "26:57", "to if you had if you had a just an open", "27:01", "ticket back in time clearly the first", "27:03", "person I visit is Jesus no hold on Jesus", "27:08", "or Buddha Jesus or Buddha that's a tough", "27:10", "choice I think I died no is the first", "27:15", "human I want to visit the first human I", "27:17", "guess the first human you would want to", "27:19", "see cavemen on the field", "27:20", "yeah I think that if I mean if I had to", "27:22", "a bunch of chances that's the first", "27:23", "thing I'd like to see then I move up to", "27:25", "Buddha and then um I don't know alright", "27:30", "here's a here's what is the research", "27:32", "clearly shows that when a total of", "27:33", "15,000 beams of neutrinos were fired the", "27:36", "tiny particles traveled the seven", "27:39", "hundred thirty kilometer", "27:41", "two point four three millisecond trip", "27:43", "roughly 60 nanoseconds faster than light", "27:47", "wow that's fast is that that's that's", "27:51", "just--that's period that's not they", "27:53", "think so that's it yeah it's a by saying", "27:58", "that this is Sauron that's putting this", "28:00", "out so that's it so who knows CERN is", "28:03", "folksy erm look it up it's the people", "28:05", "that are responsible for the Large", "28:06", "Hadron Collider which is the the", "28:08", "craziest scientific experiment ever", "28:10", "that's going on right now I believe it's", "28:12", "in Switzerland right yeah I'm sweet", "28:13", "underground fuck incredible gigantic", "28:17", "particle collider that is supposed to", "28:20", "uncover this thing called the Higgs", "28:21", "boson particle which they call or excuse", "28:23", "me Posen people correct medicine my", "28:26", "apologies bosun the god particle yeah", "28:28", "but now they're saying there's 95", "28:30", "percent sure that doesn't exist yeah", "28:32", "fuck", "28:33", "too bad you know you imagine that they", "28:35", "built this gigantic fucking billion", "28:37", "dollars when they obviously finding out", "28:39", "a bunch of other shit", "28:39", "oh yeah I'll take time traveler or some", "28:41", "stupid particle well who knows what that", "28:43", "particle means they did create that cork", "28:46", "gluon plasma shit that's I believe it's", "28:49", "one sugar cube is like four hundred", "28:51", "billion pounds or something fucking", "28:54", "crazy but that's what it weighs they", "28:56", "created some incredibly negligible", "28:58", "amount you know some tiny thank goodness", "29:00", "yeah don't want a lot of that shit", "29:02", "laying around imagine if they made like", "29:05", "a marble sized chunk of it just drop", "29:08", "through the earth just shot right like", "29:12", "water and core like water the earth", "29:14", "would just be like a big droplet of", "29:16", "water I wonder how much weight it would", "29:19", "take for that to happen like it for sure", "29:22", "if you had a bowling ball full of this", "29:25", "quark-gluon cosmic shit yeah that shit", "29:28", "would just go right through the right to", "29:30", "the earth a bowling ball would have to", "29:31", "be some insane amount of weight yeah it", "29:33", "would be yeah I don't know what the way", "29:35", "it would be at someone should know I", "29:37", "don't know if I'm wrapping your head", "29:38", "around something there's that dense", "29:40", "think about like a fat person you look", "29:42", "at like think about fat James from the", "29:45", "Condor store no fat James Lovelock James", "29:48", "a great guy calls himself fat James Fox", "29:50", "yeah office it's it's his nickname it's", "29:52", "fat James who calls you", "29:53", "hey it's Fat James yeah um that you", "29:55", "think about him as a human easy not a", "29:57", "tall fellow but he's fairly heavy and", "29:59", "you look into wow that's a that's a lot", "30:01", "of weight right there that's a model now", "30:02", "think about if he was a quark-gluon", "30:04", "plasma you know I'm saying I mean yeah", "30:08", "even wrap your head around that yeah", "30:10", "sugar cube is Sheriff 14 billion or 400", "30:13", "billion fucking pounds per over-the-hill", "30:15", "yeah whatever insane I mean when you say", "30:17", "40 billion and 400 billion I mean I know", "30:19", "that it's there's a big difference in", "30:21", "those two numbers but to me none of them", "30:23", "even register I'm just mad at noises", "30:24", "with my mouth I don't write 40 billion", "30:26", "means or 400 billion means that to me is", "30:28", "like it's too abstract it's too big", "30:30", "I'm not assimilating that you know but", "30:32", "to think about that James made out of", "30:34", "this stuff", "30:35", "you can't even like how is that even", "30:37", "possible that there could be two types", "30:39", "of matter that are both some they're so", "30:42", "far different from each other that they", "30:45", "could be the same size and one of them", "30:46", "would be literally the weight of the", "30:47", "fucking earth probably not that much", "30:50", "yeah it's it's insane to think about", "30:52", "that and it's insane to think that these", "30:53", "people are down there tinkering around", "30:55", "under Switzerland trying to make this", "30:56", "shit that's creepy", "30:59", "well they make a little tiny amounts of", "31:01", "it you know they've got a great sense of", "31:02", "humor about it they dress up like the", "31:04", "half-life dudes and they've like tape", "31:06", "half pictures of them pretending to be", "31:08", "the characters in half-life yeah because", "31:09", "we don't know the the video game", "31:11", "half-life was all about scientists", "31:13", "cracking a hole in the universe and", "31:15", "aliens come over fuck everybody up", "31:17", "awesome game what an awesome game that", "31:18", "is but dude I like to think about one", "31:21", "thing I like to think about is the Large", "31:23", "Hadron Collider accident like what it", "31:26", "would look like and like the way I see", "31:28", "it it goes like this you're on the", "31:30", "internet you look on wherever you go CNN", "31:33", "and it says fire at Large Hadron", "31:35", "Collider that's the first thing you see", "31:37", "oh my god that sucks no it doesn't we", "31:39", "there was an explosion underground", "31:41", "that's it", "31:41", "then like five minutes later it's like", "31:43", "this fire is spreading like no fire", "31:45", "we've ever seen before like the fires", "31:47", "you sir were all of a sudden just racing", "31:49", "through Switzerland no one understands", "31:50", "what's spreading that fast and I'm like", "31:52", "what the fuck and then the next thing", "31:54", "you think is what's that you're just", "31:57", "gone because this fucking energy beam is", "31:59", "shot around the planet in like a", "32:02", "millisecond just wiped everything out", "32:04", "that's that", "32:05", "now I know I've eaten too much pot", "32:06", "because inevitably my mind will start", "32:08", "going to the large house not getting", "32:10", "getting nervous about the Large Hadron", "32:11", "Collider", "32:12", "have you eaten two inch pots today no", "32:13", "you're okay totally fine you're totally", "32:16", "fun how much does that cook you take", "32:17", "just a crumb I didn't even open oh yeah", "32:19", "I took

thousand miles an hour I was", "33:34", "gone all I could think of is what the", "33:37", "fuck would happen if I took that whole", "33:39", "cookie I couldn't even keep my eyes what", "33:41", "would
