state of", "26:54", "confusion and I think one of the things", "26:57", "you're seeing with people even like", "27:00", "Trump supporters people that are these", "27:03", "online frog people you know the little", "27:05", "frog avatars I think one of the things", "27:08", "that they like about it is that become", "27:10", "they become a part of a troublesome", "27:12", "little group Oh totally yeah they have a", "27:14", "sense of purpose yeah yeah absolutely I", "27:16", "mean why do you think people join Isis I", "27:17", "mean he's European you know people in", "27:19", "Europe joining

what makes people feel", "27:56", "like they're leading a worthy life yeah", "28:00", "instead of walking through a nerfed", "28:02", "world yeah it's like what we're doing", "28:04", "right so Prozac so if you walk around", "28:06", "ask people on the street what would you", "28:08", "die for like who or what idea would you", "28:11", "die for I mean people would you know", "28:13", "they they wouldn't have an answer for", "28:14", "most of human history you know the", "28:16", "immediate answer would be well I die for", "28:18", "my people right of course like this", "28:20", "thing this our encampment gets attacked", "28:22", "by the enemy I would die I would die", "28:23", "defending this place you know and and", "28:25", "know that no one has that answer right", "28:27", "and and which's shows that we live in", "28:30", "safety and luxury which is lovely but it", "28:33", "deprives people of a sense of purpose", "28:35", "and meaning not just safety and luxury", "28:37", "but

this before that genetics", "28:57", "essentially we're riding on the same", "28:59", "genetics that were ten thousand years", "29:01", "ago from 2025 yeah are we going to", "29:05", "change that like are we going to become", "29:07", "more compatible with this bizarre and", "29:09", "artificial world that we've created or", "29:11", "are we going to get deeper and deeper", "29:13", "depressed are we going to well okay so", "29:16", "our society our culture is changing way", "29:19", "faster than genetic change can happen", "29:21", "right right so we haven't even adapted", "29:23", "genetically to the advent of Agriculture", "29:26", "ten thousand years ago that's pretty", "29:29", "crazy right so right yeah and the only", "29:31", "way genetic change happens in a", "29:33", "population is that there is a difference", "29:35", "in survival between people with one", "29:37", "trait and people with another trait so", "29:39", "so if you have a certain genetic trait", "29:42", "and it leads to you having fewer", "29:45", "children eventually ten thousand years", "29:48", "from now people with your genetic trait", "29:50", "will tend to die out because you're", "29:52", "leaving fewer you're passing on less DNA", "29:54", "to the next round right and if you have", "29:56", "a trait that allows you to raise more", "29:58", "children to maturity they carry your DNA", "30:01", "and then they'll be more successful and", "30:03", "that trait tends to spread so does human", "30:06", "unhappiness lead to lower fertility", "30:09", "rates probably not you

don't it only acts", "30:25", "through reproductive rights is something", "30:29", "happened to us then there there must be", "30:31", "some way where human beings are going to", "30:34", "become

"30:49", "but they're it will physically survive", "30:50", "for decades right so I mean evolution", "30:54", "doesn't promise happiness it doesn't", "30:55", "mean that will evolve towards happiness", "30:57", "it means that we will adapt so that we", "31:00", "can", "31:01", "reproduce our DNA for the next", "31:03", "generation that's all evolution means", "31:04", "I've always just

the argument", "63:11", "for keeping Saddam Hussein in power was", "63:13", "the argument for keeping Gaddafi in", "63:15", "power yeah I mean basically it's sort of", "63:18", "utilitarian argument it was from John", "63:20", "Stuart Mill like what's going to what's", "63:22", "going to cause the least human suffering", "63:24", "or promote the most human happiness and", "63:25", "and you know I sometimes I can", "63:29", "understand the reasoning behind look the", "63:31", "guy is a dictator but we should leave", "63:33", "them in place because the alternative is", "63:36", "a lot of other innocent people suffering", "63:38", "when we remove him in the country", "63:41", "collapses this country has already", "63:42", "collapsed so the projects or the", "63:44", "question is okay we make a tentative", "63:45", "peace deal with him we'll leave you in", "63:47", "power we won't try to topple you but", "63:50", "let's stop fighting I mean I can I could", "63:52", "support that yeah personally Wow isn't", "63:56", "that crazy the idea of keeping that guy", "63:58", "in power yeah so less people suffer you", "64:01", "keep a brutal murderous dictator in", "64:03", "power", "64:03", "yeah and I'm better off that way yeah", "64:06", "well I mean you know the war killed", "64:07", "almost half a million people yeah if you", "64:08", "want if you want that to continue like", "64:10", "right yeah that's I mean those are the", "64:12", "awful moral choices", "64:14", "it's very frustrating for people though", "64:16", "because they would like to see like they", "64:17", "would like to see some solution like on", "64:21", "the tape but that doesn't seem like a", "64:22", "solution well well it's a solution to", "64:24", "the violence right I mean I any P any", "64:26", "peace deal is a solution to the violence", "64:27", "so and the first thing that has to", "64:29", "happen I think is that the violence stop", "64:32", "so that people stop dying the pursuit of", "64:36", "justice is a secondary it's important", "64:38", "but it's a secondary matter after that I", "64:42", "know you're running out of time here so", "64:44", "just good", "64:45",

"65:27", "you're making documentary you suddenly", "65:29", "start to see themes and structures in", "65:31", "the film in human affairs and then they", "65:34", "sort of come out and and and when and", "65:38", "when you work on that level it's", "65:40", "incredible to me it's like an incredibly", "65:42", "gratifying and because that means that", "65:45", "I've now made sense of something there's", "65:47", "a disorderly confusing world and I've", "65:49", "managed to organize it in an", "65:51", "understandable way and that means other", "65:52", "people can understand it and then we can", "65:54", "have a conversation about how the world", "65:56", "works and how people work and that to me", "65:59", "is the point of journalism it's the", "66:00", "point of all intellectual
