hyperbaric", "36:53", "chamber no it's just they've always done", "36:56", "that on planes and so it's like you're", "36:58", "in a plane when you're in the", "36:59", "hyperbarics and what it does is it", "37:01", "pressurizes the oxygen down into your", "37:04", "cells so it's literally going into your", "37:06", "mitochondria that's what the new studies", "37:08", "are showing now oxygen gets in there and", "37:10", "it promotes healing and in your brain it", "37:13", "literally brings blood flow into every", "37:15", "part of the brain that needs it", "37:17", "so it's one of the best things

prescription and said hey", "37:51", "I really think he needs to do", "37:52", "hyperbarics that's one of the best", "37:54", "things for concussions now I was like I", "37:56", "just started and so literally that day", "37:58", "the doctor hands him a prescription for", "38:00", "hyperbarics and then I take him in there", "38:02", "and get hyperbarics and this is probably", "38:04", "the story I wanted to share with you", "38:06", "about hyperbarics the most there's this", "38:07", "kid named Caleb Freeman and he just made", "38:10", "NBC Nightly News", "38:12", "I think Fox News and ABC he's making the", "38:16", "news everywhere because of his comeback", "38:18", "story the kid probably should have never", "38:20", "been able to eat again on his own", "38:21", "especially never be able to walk his", "38:24", "parents were told that he would be left", "38:25", "in a vegetative state and if you have", "38:27", "that Caleb Freeman video because of one", "38:29", "he got in a vicious

kind of coaching him but", "38:51", "he was the number one cross-country", "38:53", "runner now he's trying to get him to do", "38:54", "a thumbs up and this is off and I've yep", "38:56", "traumatic brain injury driving down the", "38:59", "road hit hit uh what's a hydroplane he", "39:03", "got in a brutal wreck and they thought", "39:05", "he would be left in a vegetative state", "39:07", "for the rest of his life so you can see", "39:09", "right here his muscles are so atrophied", "39:10", "because he had been in like I think he", "39:13", "was in a coma or he was in intensive", "39:15", "care for so long and so his dad's trying", "39:18", "to get him to do a thumbs up you know", "39:20", "he's trying his hardest to do that you", "39:22", "can go to the second video and they're", "39:25", "telling them you should really try", "39:26", "hyperbarics they try everything you can", "39:29", "and so the whole community has rallied", "39:31", "around them in Oklahoma", "39:33", "he's from Newcastle where one of our", "39:34", "board members are from and they're", "39:36", "trying to help him learn to walk again", "39:38", "assist it I don't know what they have", "39:39", "him

"39:58", "far gone II was and then after 40", "40:02", "hyperbaric treatments they said get him", "40:04", "in there it'll flood his brain with", "40:05", "oxygen right when it has the oxygen", "40:07", "it'll reproduce the blood flow and", "40:09", "they'll bring actual healing into his", "40:11", "brain and so that third video is right", "40:16", "here he's literally he was the number", "40:18", "one cross-country runner at his school", "40:20", "so now he's trying to learn how to do a", "40:23", "cross-country again he wasn't ever", "40:24", "supposed to walk again on his own he",

"40:35", "sudden he walks up and down the football", "40:37", "field", "40:37", "14 times unassisted nothing changed just", "40:42", "40 hyperbaric treatments so I felt like", "40:44", "you got to

"46:02", "chamber 90 minutes later we get out he", "46:05", "shows me his hand it's completely steel", "46:06", "and he can put contacts back in his eyes", "46:09", "whoa", "46:09", "but before there's no way at all that he", "46:12", "can get contacts in his eyes afterwards", "46:14", "his body's calmed down enough his brain", "46:16", "has enough oxygen and blood flow in it", "46:18", "that he can put his contacts back in", "46:19", "them that's insane yeah so Radin his", "46:24", "parents say that he was always up and", "46:26", "down in the middle of the night and that", "46:27",

nothing better the", "46:46", "doctors take an oath that say to do no", "46:48", "harm", "46:48", "like that's first and foremost is to do", "46:51", "no harm and they're like if someone has", "46:53", "a concussion or if someone has autism or", "46:56", "if someone has this bacteria or a", "46:59", "parasite that might be in the brain", "47:01", "why not flood the body on a cellular", "47:04", "level oh you're gonna love this part", "47:05", "that can increase your your stem cells", "47:08", "by eight times in your body so it's one", "47:11", "of the best treatments for whenever you", "47:12", "have the stem cells injected in you", "47:15", "mm-hmm so I had the MSC's the", "47:17", "mesenchymal stem cells for my hip put in", "47:19", "my shoulder mm-hmm they said one of the", "47:21", "best things I could have done for it", "47:23", "would have been to get in a hyperbaric", "47:24", "chamber because that would promote the", "47:27", "stem cell growth and life of the stem", "47:29", "cells because their cells and you're", "47:31", "pushing oxygen into the cells you know", "47:34", "an increasing blood flow into it and", "47:35", "you're extending their life and helping", "47:37", "them reproduce yeah so it's one of the", "47:40", "best things out there Joe I wouldn't be", "47:42", "talking about it like this without", "47:44", "Raphael is getting into it Joe Namath",

"47:55", "first time there's ever been documented", "47:57", "cases of brain trauma reversal", "48:00", "where if you can heal your brain you can", "48:02", "basically heal your life or have a", "48:04", "healthy brain you have a healthy life do", "48:05", "we need a hyperbaric chamber in here", "48:07", "yeah you buy portable units absolutely I", "48:10", "use something called a Sechrist which I", "48:12", "think you would really like it's the", "48:13", "hard chamber it's glass you have one in", "48:15", "your house no but the Sechrist one or", "48:17", "there's Joe Namath doing it I think", "48:19", "Michael Phelps does it you know getting", "48:21", "in the water look at that Wow literally", "48:26", "it's wild at how how much stuff it", "48:28", "actually so what's the
