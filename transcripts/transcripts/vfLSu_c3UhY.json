like you know", "24:54", "he played in the NFL for like 16 years", "24:56", "which is pretty much unheard of", "24:58", "especially like I was like a linebacker", "25:00", "and that like he just was hunt like he", "25:04", "was depressed about not getting the that", "25:06", "rush anymore you know being like in the", "25:08", "in the games in the well so he I", "25:11", "consider a little brain dump yeah yeah", "25:12", "definitely yeah that's the thing man", "25:14", "they say that brain damage they say once", "25:16", "it fucks with your pituitary your brain", "25:18", "stops producing the

brain injury", "25:35", "argument I don't I don't totally", "25:37", "completely understand it but I think", "25:39", "they're saying is if you get hit in the", "25:41", "head enough like James Toney was an", "25:42", "example of it you get hit in the head", "25:43", "enough and your body's not gonna produce", "25:45", "testosterone the same way yeah", "25:47", "but then I've heard other doctors say", "25:49", "and this kind of makes sense to me well", "25:50", "hey man if you can't produce", "25:52", "testosterone anymore because you got hit", "25:54", "in the head so many times like maybe you", "25:55", "should stop getting hit in the head", "25:57", "that's a great yeah it's a great lesson", "25:59", "you know it seems like that's the things", "26:01", "just stop first", "26:02", "yeah like yeah but forget about like", "26:05", "trying to do anything to supplement your", "26:07", "testosterone you gotta stop getting hit", "26:09", "in the head cuz then your brains gonna", "26:10", "stop working it's just like yeah many", "26:12", "times can you hit your car with a hammer", "26:13", "before the engine breaks", "26:14", "it's like ye enough you know there's a", "26:18",

"26:40", "and this ability to try to figure out", "26:42", "where you're punching and block you and", "26:43", "cover you he's a brilliant boxer yeah if", "26:46", "you go back to the early days like when", "26:48", "he knocked out Michael Dunn James Toney", "26:50", "is a goddamn animal man he he's a power", "26:53", "punch out tough dude and he became a", "26:56", "slick ass boxer he just didn't have the", "27:00", "same motivation to training that like", "27:03", "some other guys did yeah like if he", "27:05", "trained like Roy Jones jr. train oh my", "27:07", "god yeah and what a fight that
