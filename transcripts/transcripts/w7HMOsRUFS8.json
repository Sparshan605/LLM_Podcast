bathroom somewhere or", "101:14", "whatever your solutely all that stuff", "101:16", "could easily apply to how human beings", "101:19", "interact with the earth are we the virus", "101:21", "don't act like because when you got a", "101:23", "look at at some point the earth is oh", "101:25", "you or the theory is it's a living", "101:27", "breathing organism here's what I could", "101:29", "say for sure", "101:30", "okay we are the virus to the ocean", "101:31", "because we don't even it at what and", "101:33", "think about it yeah that's life yeah", "101:36", "before we were monkeys we were something", "101:38", "that crawled out of the ocean right", "101:40", "right imagine that earth the ocean was I", "101:43", "mean I don't know what it was like we", "101:45", "are hunting 100 really style", "101:46", "this is where our fans wanted to go", "101:48", "we're still in this fuck I don't know", "101:50", "what the ocean was like a couple hundred", "101:52", "thousand years ago before people really", "101:54", "became what we are to tool-using", "101:56", "you know people that figured out how to", "101:58", "get out into the ocean and capture fish", "102:00", "who imagine if you could see it", "102:03", "imagine if you could see an image of how", "102:05", "many fucking fish were out there 200,000", "102:08", "years ago versus how many are now it's", "102:10", "like they live

the kind of ship that they landed on", "103:54", "the moon I'm gonna put one on the zone", "103:57", "apparently some type of role on the dark", "103:59", "side though right", "104:00", "on the side that we didn't make it to or", "104:01", "just went and tell me you love it was a", "104:03", "drone right you know what it was some", "104:05", "sort of a drone I think of that I", "104:07", "honestly think about that as a win for", "104:09", "science and for innovation", "104:11", "I don't think about in terms of like", "104:12", "nations because I feel like that is done", "104:14", "by scientist that's done by the Wizards", "104:16", "and the job so are you saying we're", "104:18", "gonna steal the scientists because when", "104:19", "Kennedy gave the fucking speech Kennedy", "104:21", "made it seem like the moon landing was", "104:23", "gonna make us the preeminent nation and", "104:25", "I think that's the propaganda China's", "104:27", "gonna rolling you don't think well I", "104:29", "think they have some fucking amazing", "104:31", "technology to deny that would be", "104:33", "ridiculous", "104:34", "but I also think that it's important", "104:35", "that everybody everybody be competitive", "104:38", "in this like if you really want to make", "104:40", "things better you're not gonna you", "104:42", "you're not gonna do that in a vacuum god", "104:44", "what helps the technological innovation", "104:46", "in one of the reasons why it's so", "104:47", "accelerated is there's so many people", "104:48", "working on it it's not just a few people", "104:50", "trying to make cell phones better I", "104:52", "gotta fucking so many geniuses out there", "104:54", "so when I see something like this like", "104:56", "they landed on the moon I
