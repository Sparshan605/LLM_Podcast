"09:13", "that's you know not good for someone who", "09:16", "doesn't want to gain weight and just you", "09:19", "know so people know the the way that it", "09:21", "does do that is when THC attaches to the", "09:23", "cb1 receptor you get an increase in", "09:25", "hormone called ghrelin and ghrelin can", "09:28", "actually induce hunger and that's why", "09:30", "people get get the

said to me you know it's not", "09:50", "available so you should probably you", "09:52", "know not talk about as much but there is", "09:55", "another cannabinoid called th cv so you", "09:58", "know there's there's over 100", "09:59", "cannabinoids in cannabis cncd are only", "10:02", "two of them you know those are the main", "10:03", "ones that people know about so THC v has", "10:06", "been

"10:33", "course", "10:33", "yeah so it's like if they don't need to", "10:35", "go to him to get in time right so people", "10:37", "so you're seeing a population that is", "10:39", "genuinely interested in the health", "10:40", "benefits absolutely because I mean if", "10:42", "and I mean I'm glad that that that's", "10:45", "legalized in Canada because it does make", "10:47", "my job a little bit easier because being", "10:49", "like basically everyone who's coming to", "10:50", "me now I know that they want to use it", "10:52", "medically because if they want to use it", "10:54",

is so you", "11:35", "know I think that you know we do need to", "11:37", "look at the scientific evidence but we", "11:39", "do need to listen to others and the", "11:40", "antidotal evidence is you

medicine and I'd rather separate it", "13:33", "but yeah why he's saying don't pretend", "13:36", "because there's many medicines that have", "13:38", "horrific side of them the medicine THC",

it's not", "14:47", "real what I'm saying is that the reason", "14:49", "we have clinical trials is because", "14:52", "science the way you know whether a", "14:55", "medicine works or not whether a

I", "21:23", "believe it was there was a a", "21:24", "meta-analysis done I can pull it up if", "21:26", "we need to that indicated that you know", "21:28", "a lot of medicines that are being used",

this is a medicine and I think", "23:17", "that's where the confusion around really", "23:19", "around high THC cannabis lies and I and", "23:22", "again I don't mean to say that your", "23:24",

had", "24:26", "a had more pain and used more opiates at", "24:30", "the end of four years than people who", "24:32", "didn't so that so I we're almost argue", "24:34", "about what medicine is yeah that study", "24:37", "though had a lot of flaws in it and the", "24:40", "other thing is that you need to look at", "24:42", "someone who is already using cannabis", "24:44", "versus someone who is just using opioids", "24:47", "so if someone is just using opioids and", "24:50", "they want to come off cannabis you know", "24:53", "there's multiple yeah sorry sorry come", "24:54", "off of opiates with cannabis you know", "24:56", "multiple studies have shown that that", "24:58", "that can be effective and that's not was", "25:01", "what was done in the Australian study", "25:03", "that that

that", "26:30", "I said to the extent I'm trying to have", "26:34", "I'll stop doing that but you know I", "26:38", "think you said something else that was", "26:39", "really interesting to me and this came", "26:41", "up in the book - so you're a clinician", "26:43", "you see sick people and it was funny my", "26:46", "wife's a doctor - she's a psychiatrist", "26:48", "that's how I sort of got him this but my", "26:50", "wife is a forensic psychiatrist less", "26:52", "than a clinician these days her job is", "26:54", "to evaluate people not so much to treat", "26:56", "people your job is

know", "27:39", "you know one thing that was mentioned in", "27:41", "your book you know is that you know you", "27:44", "officers you often cited the National", "27:46", "Academies of science and engineering", "27:47", "right but you know ziva Cooper you know", "27:50", "she's a member of that committee I mean", "27:52", "she put out on on her Twitter I mean you", "27:54", "can go to it it's from January 9th of", "27:57", "2019 she says in response in the recent", "28:00", "New York Times editorial on cannabis and", "28:02", "as a committee member which came that", "28:03", "which by the way that context were came", "28:08", "from right but this is a someone you", "28:10", "cited no I didn't cite her excited to", "28:12", "Kate you say that you cited that the", "28:14", "report and

committee and cannabinoids report", "28:25", "we did not conclude that cannabis causes", "28:28", "schizophrenia then the drug Alliance", "28:31", "policy also said the report and did not", "28:33",

"28:44", "properly right and then also they're", "28:46", "saying that you left a lot out right", "28:48", "they said that they have found an", "28:50", "association between marijuana use and", "28:52", "improved cognitive outcomes and", "28:54", "individuals with psychotic disorders", "28:56", "that's straight from the same report and", "28:58", "you know you failed to mention that", "29:01", "right so I think that you know when", "29:03", "we're writing books or when we're giving", "29:05", "out information you want to do it from a", "29:07", "balanced approach and you don't want to", "29:09", "just select you know the small amount of", "29:11", "material that's just going to support", "29:13", "your study you know we want to be", "29:15", "truthful here you know Joe's show has", "29:18", "always been very truthful I mean Joe", "29:19", "said right right at the beginning he", "29:21", "doesn't think that that the cannabis is", "29:23", "perfect for everyone and I don't think", "29:25", "that either and in Canada you know we", "29:27", "have really strict guidelines to follow", "29:29", "you know basically no one prescribes", "29:31", "cheap seed anyone under the age of of 25", "29:35", "and you know all the conferences and", "29:38", "stuff that I go to you know we don't", "29:40", "really have too many discussions about", "29:41", "that like the doctors don't really have", "29:43", "many you know much of a backlash about", "29:45", "that so why is a distinction at age of", "29:48", "25 or they decide that age so 25", "29:50", "basically is when you're your friend oh", "29:53", "yeah it's fully developed and when you", "29:55", "do look at the studies that do show you", "29:58", "know an association between between", "30:00", "cannabis and psychosis it's almost all", "30:02", "in adolescents you know I think that", "30:05", "Alex only has one study and is in its", "30:09", "book that shows an extremely weak", "30:11", "correlation between an adult

conservative ish ish", "30:25", "age but you know it's it's something", "30:27", "that that we follow and I think that you", "30:29", "know we've done well with that in Canada", "30:30", "so Alex why did you leave those", "30:32", "conclusions oh I need to push back here", "30:34", "okay so the National Academy of Medicine", "30:36", "report was drawn up by committee of 16", "30:40", "researchers ziva Cooper is the one who's", "30:44", "publicly said the report said this but I", "30:48", "think that we should have emphasized", "30:51", "that it also said this okay what I what", "30:54", "I wrote in that New York Times op-ed", "30:57", "I wrote in the book is the plain", "30:59", "language of the report and the plain", "31:01", "language is this cannabis use is", "31:03", "associated

doing it from memory but", "31:13", "that's what it said and by the way the", "31:15", "committee was very clear they separated", "31:19", "depression they said there we don't see", "31:21", "as

and some people won't you know some", "32:30", "people have you know the personality", "32:32", "some people have the platform like you", "32:33", "know Ziva has a bunch of followers on", "32:35",

just", "40:04", "wrong that's possible there's other", "40:06", "friends oh absolutely", "40:08", "environmental factors is a bunch of", "40:09", "other different things let me let me sit", "40:11",

"40:20", "and schizophrenia which are by the way", "40:22", "those are sort of different illnesses", "40:24", "and we can we can talk about that too", "40:26", "so we don't have the evidence to say", "40:27", "there's a definite increase but what I'm", "40:29", "saying is that what you have been told", "40:31", "that there is no increase in", "40:34", "schizophrenia or psychosis rates in the", "40:36", "US that's we don't know if that's true", "40:39", "or not we just let me ask you this there", "40:41", "has been proven that there's an increase", "40:43", "in marijuana use is that correct correct", "40:44", "how when when did the increase begin and", "40:47", "how what how what percentage increase so", "40:50", "there was a there was an increase in the", "40:52", "90s an increase in use and in potency", "40:55", "you sort of bottom doubt around 1991 and", "40:58", "then there was sort of a flat bottomed", "41:00", "out mean it has an increase in tonight", "41:02", "you 54 cent since 92 it's a lot letting", "41:08", "you expect a corresponding increase in", "41:09", "schizophrenia if there was any sort of", "41:11", "correlation so hold on let me just let", "41:13", "me walk you through okay it bottomed out", "41:14", "in the early 90s okay I increased again", "41:16", "increased in the 90s flattened out", "41:18", "between about 2000 2006 and since then", "41:21", "has been going up again especially in", "41:23", "let's say the last three four years and", "41:24", "the other thing is that potency in the", "41:26", "last 15 years has gone way up I think", "41:28", "anybody would dispute that but okay it's", "41:31", "a friend a gun so what I'm saying to you", "41:32", "is we don't know", "41:34", "there is evidence there is there is now", "41:36", "evidence on a population level basis in", "41:38", "those other countries that schizophrenia", "41:40", "and psychosis has gone up and there's", "41:43", "for the first time in 2017 there's data", "41:46", "showing that serious mental illness", "41:48", "which is not the same as psychosis or", "41:50", "schizophrenia in the u.s. doubled", "41:52", "between 2008 and 2017 in the and the in", "41:57", "people aged 18 to 25 and those are the", "42:00", "people who are most likely to be using", "42:01", "so for", "42:02", "the first time there's actually evidence", "42:03", "of what you're talking about which is a", "42:05", "population wide increase now again I'm", "42:08", "not gonna say can I get you to clarify", "42:10", "it should say serious mental health", "42:12", "serious mental illness so this was", "42:14", "defined there's a study called the", "42:17", "national survey on drug use and health", "42:18", "it's done every year covers 70,000", "42:20", "people federal government funds it it", "42:22", "sort of the best data source we have on", "42:24", "all this stuff", "42:26", "it showed that and they're not counting", "42:29", "cases either no but let me just be as", "42:31", "clear as I can on this nobody's counting", "42:33", "schizophrenia cases on a national or", "42:35", "even state level because in the US but", "42:37", "you say to people did you have", "42:39", "depression so bad that you couldn't get", "42:41", "out of bed", "42:42", "did you you know were you hospitalized", "42:44", "this year for psycho for for any", "42:47", "inpatient psychiatric reason and and if", "42:50", "you look at those numbers in 2008 three", "42:55", "point seven percent remember it may be", "42:56", "three point eight percent of Americans", "42:58", "18 to 25 reported at least one symptom", "43:02", "so they were categorized as having", "43:04", "serious mental illness that year in 2017", "43:09", "that number was seven point five percent", "43:11", "so that's a doubling so again I am NOT", "43:15", "going to say that proves that the", "43:16", "increase in cannabis use has caused this", "43:19", "this population some things but", "43:21", "something bad has happened and if you", "43:24", "look at kids 12 to 17 interestingly they", "43:27", "over that time period didn't have a big", "43:30", "increase in cannabis use in general", "43:31", "teenagers are actually are pretty", "43:34", "healthy now although Jul and vaping may", "43:36", "be undoing that and those kids didn't", "43:38", "have a population level increase in", "43:40", "serious mental illness can I stop you", "43:42", "for a second there because there's other", "43:43", "factors one of the big one is you've all", "43:45", "know a herati has a great book 21", "43:48", "lessons for the 21st century I really I", "43:49", "read that it's great and one of the", "43:51", "things they talk about is the onset of", "43:53", "social media Jonathan Haidt talked about", "43:55", "that as well and that the onset of", "43:57", "social media is actually more hate and", "43:59", "then you Vaughn Harada but the Jonathan", "44:03", "Haidt talks about it with young people", "44:04", "yeah that's a huge American mind yeah I", "44:07", "think that social media and the", "44:09", "pressures of social media have led an", "44:11", "incredible amount of young people to", "44:13", "serious mental distress", "44:15", "you know serious anxiety serious", "44:17", "depression and suicide amongst young", "44:19", "girls has increased some 50 percent", "44:22",

"pressures of social media and to you", "44:35", "know anonymous online bullying and all", "44:37", "these different factors that are", "44:38", "affecting kids yeah so I think that that", "44:41", "could be considered a far more", "44:43", "significant new form of distress to", "44:49", "children and young people", "44:50", "then even marijuana I think it does it", "44:52", "twofold because I think that you know", "44:54", "what makes people really depressed maybe", "44:57", "more so than than anxious but definitely", "44:58", "both is that when you compare yourself", "45:00", "to someone else", "45:01", "and you know you know people you know", "45:03", "obviously that we've done that you know", "45:05", "all all humans have done that you know", "45:07", "since history began but now everything", "45:10", "is online you can compare your life to", "45:13", "everyone and if people are doing all the", "45:15", "time and even worse than that and you", "45:17", "know we should talk about this too is", "45:18", "that the income gap is getting is", "45:20", "getting water so it's like people's", "45:22", "lives not only are they getting you know", "45:25", "better than other people's lives but", "45:27", "it's but it now it's on it's on display", "45:29", "so everyone can see it whereas before", "45:31", "you know maybe what you wouldn't have", "45:32", "seen it because it wasn't on social", "45:34", "media but now it's on social media so", "45:36", "you have this huge income gap that just", "45:38", "keeps getting bigger and bigger and", "45:39", "bigger and then you have people going", "45:41", "going on social media and they're", "45:42", "comparing themselves and you're", "45:44", "absolutely right especially in that in", "45:46", "that age population mean people under", "45:48", "under the age of 30 you know they're", "45:50", "definitely you know they're being", "45:52", "bullied online like I see every day in", "45:54", "my office like literally every day", "45:56", "people are being bullied online and", "45:58", "that's you know something that I never", "45:59", "had you know to deal with growing up", "46:01", "yeah and you know a lot of kids do have", "46:04", "to have to deal with that just one more", "46:07", "note - on the since Colorado has has has", "46:10", "legalized cannabis is this important for", "46:12", "for this this is the subject miss topic", "46:15", "they've actually seen marijuana rates", "46:18", "decrease so it's important for people to", "46:21", "know that you know no no no no they've", "46:23", "decided tnehews or overall use overall", "46:26", "has gone up tnews is flat", "46:29", "overall uses up okay yeah I'm talking", "46:31", "about teen you've got that'll got that's", "46:32", "the category that were talking about", "46:33", "under under 30", "46:34", "right so teen use you know what classify", "46:37", "is part of that category so you know in", "46:39", "Colorado we have seen a decrease do you", "46:42", "think that's because of the lack of", "46:43", "either because it's not illegal it's not", "46:46", "as exciting to them part of it for sure", "46:48", "you know and I mean part of it is like", "46:50", "one worry I had you know I haven't", "46:52", "looked into the statistics yet it was", "46:55", "you know when when you're growing up and", "46:57", "when you're in high school you know if", "46:59", "you want to be part of the you know cool", "47:01", "crowd so to say what you know you", "47:03", "usually drink or you smoke pot you know", "47:06", "that's what so people do I hope that", "47:10", "that doesn't change because pot seeing", "47:12", "as medicine I hope that you know people", "47:15", "don't you don't move on to or do", "47:18", "something you know harsher because they", "47:19", "don't see pot as cool anymore right", "47:23", "because it's legal yeah so I got a", "47:25", "pushback on the whole thing please so", "47:28", "everything you say about social media is", "47:29", "down you know it sort of intuitively", "47:31", "sounds correct right the problem is the", "47:33", "data doesn't support this at all the", "47:35", "data shows that teenagers another 12 to", "47:38", "17 those kids are healthier than they", "47:42", "were ten or twenty or thirty years ago", "47:44", "they drink less they smoke less they", "47:46", "have sex later that fewer abortions they", "47:48", "are healthier okay okay and their mental", "47:51", "health doesn't seem to have changed that", "47:53", "much based on the NSDUH data okay the", "47:56", "data shows a big change in kids 18 to 25", "48:01", "they go to college", "48:02", "something goes wrong for a lot of those", "48:04", "kids at least in the last few years now", "48:07", "but wait a minute even when you're", "48:08", "talking about suicide rates suicide", "48:10", "rates are there especially with young", "48:12", "girls who are apparently more affected", "48:15", "by social media they have gone up", "48:16", "significantly since the rise of social", "48:19", "media that is the big factor people for", "48:21", "almost a second more so than cannabis", "48:23", "use and then that's a fact so so you're", "48:25", "so you're talking about a tiny tiny", "48:26", "number the people who know no it's not a", "48:28", "tiny number it's a fifty percent", "48:30", "increase of people that

young girls", "48:39", "that are committing suicide to fit your", "48:41", "statistics or", "48:42", "fit your conclusions no what I'm saying", "48:44", "is that's a tiny tiny number but it's", "48:45", "it's a 50% increase is not a tiny amount", "48:48", "this is something we can look up well", "48:50", "let's find out what the numbers are like", "48:52", "because like when Jonathan hate was on", "48:54", "the podcast and he discussed it I mean", "48:56", "he showed this chart and it's an", "48:57", "alarming increase directly correlating", "49:00", "with the increase in use of social media", "49:01", "sure but you push back against that it", "49:06", "seems to be a factor what what I'm when", "49:09", "I'm pushing back against is the idea", "49:10", "that kids 12 to 17 generally are less", "49:14", "healthy than they were 10 or 20 years", "49:15", "ago ones saying they're less healthy you", "49:18", "just said they're more healthy yeah I'm", "49:19", "saying they're more

who has PTSD", "76:56", "and again this is this comes from a", "76:58", "clinicians point of view they will tell", "77:00", "you I will try anything and that's the", "77:03", "same way when you get with like you know", "77:05", "the parents of kids who have seizures", "77:09", "all day nobody wants to see that you're", "77:11", "in like I'm like Alex you know if your", "77:13", "kids you know

"sober October well we don't do any no", "78:29", "drinking no no pot and then we do some", "78:32", "sort of crazy challenge me and three of", "78:34", "my buddies and when we do it what it's", "78:38", "it's very interesting how your tolerance", "78:40", "is radically reduced I guess I'll smoke", "78:43", "pot at the end of that month and I'm", "78:44", "like holy shit like I don't even know", "78:47", "what I'm talking about the mid-sentence", "78:48", "and I'm just blitzkrieged whereas you", "78:51", "know now like I smoked a little weed", "78:53", "last night did some stand-up had a great", "78:54", "old time there's no issues with it at", "78:56", "all but I'm used to it and if the weed", "78:58", "that I smoked last I assume you don't", "79:00", "smoke I do not okay if you

this", "79:26", "other comedian", "79:28", "how many milligrams of those stars of", "79:30", "death Oh Tilly like when we give Owen", "79:33", "what did he give oh I think just one you", "79:35",

"79:48", "outside he vanished he's gone well I", "79:54", "think I think there's a real argument to", "79:56", "be made it's particularly with him well", "79:58", "I was gonna make two points on that so", "80:01", "you definitely can develop a tolerance", "80:03", "yeah and I tell people all the time try", "80:06", "and take at least one three week break", "80:08", "but the evidence does show that if you", "80:11", "stop for four weeks", "80:13", "generally all your receptors return and", "80:15", "will be like you've never used cannabis", "80:17", "before so that's and that's even with", "80:20", "people who are really really heavy users", "80:23", "I can go back and get the study but I", "80:26", "mean these people are you using I'm", "80:27", "pretty sure it was like close like seven", "80:29", "joints a day well really heavy users and", "80:31", "noop dogs a good example of that you", "80:33", "know my friend Tony Hinchcliffe his good", "80:34", "buddies with Snoop Dogg and he said", "80:36", "Snoop Dogg just smokes all day and he", "80:40", "just like is always high and you know", "80:42", "you're like well what do you do when", "80:43", "you're not I is like what I'm never not", "80:46", "high so everything he does he is high as", "80:49", "fuck really everything he does look for", "80:51", "that guy it's not that big of a deal and", "80:52", "for the way he lives his life like he's", "80:55", "just a relaxed easygoing guy it's no", "80:57", "problem you could be high all day and", "80:59", "live his life and he's obviously wildly", "81:01", "successful with this strategy yeah", "81:03", "loudly second point I was gonna I was", "81:06", "gonna make on that too though was there", "81:09", "does not appear to be any tolerance at", "81:12", "the cb2 receptor

they use some THC and", "81:22", "sometimes they need a little bit more", "81:23", "same sometimes asleep you know they use", "81:25", "THC it'll work and then we'll stop", "81:27", "working with CBD too we haven't seen", "81:29", "that meaning like the people who you", "81:32", "know get get seizure control generally", "81:34", "they don't need to increase the dose", "81:36", "like the girl I was talking about", "81:38", "earlier you know I first subscriber I", "81:40", "think when she was 20 and she was my", "81:41", "20 she's 25 now she's never increased", "81:45", "her dose and she's just used the same", "81:46", "amount to CBD for the last think we", "81:52", "should really stop talking about CBD I", "81:54", "just wanted to make a note on the on BIA", "81:57", "tolerance of anyone I just wanted to", "82:00", "make a note that CB to the doesn't", "82:02", "appear to be tolerance it's all yeah", "82:03", "it's just there's just such a", "82:05", "significant impact when when it

"93:52", "know off the edge I don't know if you", "93:56", "can necessarily blame cannabis for that", "93:58", "and it would be really interesting to", "94:00", "find out if there was some form of a", "94:02", "treatment like you were saying with CBD", "94:04", "that could counteract that maybe has", "94:08", "been shown in early stage studies to", "94:11", "have some moderate impact on psychosis I", "94:13", "I don't think from the the numbers that", "94:15", "I've seen suggest it really isn't that", "94:17", "strong as an mi psychotic but I do think", "94:19", "that if I were a researcher

Lee the", "94:29", "antipsychotics that we have out there", "94:31", "are not good they have terrible they", "94:33", "have terrible side effects and most of", "94:36", "them do have some initial Bennett", "94:38", "benefit but after two to three years", "94:40", "there's almost no benefit one right and", "94:42", "they have as you said really bad side", "94:45", "effects weight gain

things", "95:10", "that happen badly and your life losing", "95:12", "your job losing your girlfriend deaths", "95:14", "in the family can contribute with some", "95:17", "folks but psychedelic drugs can as well", "95:19", "I mean it's a fact yeah but for some", "95:21", "people psychedelic drugs have tremendous", "95:23", "benefits for PTSD quitting alcohol", "95:25", "quitting hard drugs there's a lot of", "95:28", "people that have used mushrooms MDMA for", "95:30", "PTSD is a huge thing that Maps is", "95:33", "studying right now but you can't deny", "95:35", "that there's other people and", "95:37", "well-documented that have taken LSD that", "95:39", "have taken psilocybin and taken them in", "95:41", "large doses in gone yes and never", "95:44", "recovered yeah you know and that's why -", "95:46", "I forget who it was maybe it was McKenna", "95:49", "who is on and you guys were saying that", "95:51", "like you know we need to use psychedelic", "95:54", "medicines but we need to use them", "95:56", "properly right and that's the same way", "95:58", "with with with cannabis as well and I", "96:00", "consider cannabis too psychedelic yeah", "96:02", "particularly when you eat it absolutely", "96:04", "you know it is it is a mild psychedelic", "96:06", "and you know so those rests and benefits", "96:08", "to that and you know we need to tease", "96:09", "out the rest and tease out the benefits", "96:11", "and make sure that people we should make", "96:13", "but Alex we need to make sure that", "96:14", "people are informed and they get the", "96:16", "entire picture right so you know does", "96:19", "your book have some truth in it yes of", "96:21", "course it does but does it tell the", "96:23", "whole truth absolutely not right and", "96:25", "that's the message that you know I think", "96:27", "people should be hearing people", "96:28", "shouldn't be hearing just part of the", "96:30", "truth they should be hearing the whole", "96:31", "truth and again you know like in your", "96:33", "book like you compared you know that the", "96:35", "Mexico in India right and you know I", "96:38", "talked it to German Lopez on the phone", "96:40", "about this and you know who talked to", "96:42", "Isaac Hampshire's right and he said so", "96:44", "so Isaac Campos you know he's the guy", "96:47", "who who basically you know was told the", "96:49", "story of how how in Mexico you know", "96:52", "people were blaming marijuana people", "96:55", "were blaming marijuana on causing", "96:58", "psychosis during kind of like the early", "97:00", "1900's and then there was some evidence", "97:03", "as well in India at that time so I was", "97:05", "kind of made the connection you know", "97:07", "9,000 miles", "97:08", "part you know they're both saying the", "97:10", "same thing but you know he said that you", "97:13", "know you did misinterpret the evidence", "97:15", "on it right and and in German told me", "97:17", "that on the phone and I mean all the", "97:19", "cannabis that was used in Mexico at that", "97:21", "time was in you know really marginalized", "97:23", "environments and then when you look at", "97:25", "the India study you know that they say", "97:28", "and I know that you addressed this in", "97:29", "your book house cuz I did read your book", "97:30", "sounds like you did I bought your book", "97:32", "so you know in some ways I did yeah so I", "97:37", "read your book and like I said you know", "97:39", "you did address in the part on India", "97:42", "that yeah you know some of the report", "97:44", "was wrong but I mean the fact is that", "97:47", "all almost a lot of those cases in India", "97:50", "were were actually attributed to alcohol", "97:52", "or opiates or other things and then the", "97:54", "other thing in in Mexico is that it was", "97:57", "in those environments so you know", "97:59", "basically what I'm kind of getting in", "98:01", "here is like you know that the National", "98:03", "Academy of Sciences and engineering you", "98:05", "know they you know disagree with how you", "98:08", "interpreted their findings and they know", "98:10", "these people deceive how you interpreted", "98:13", "their finds okay but Ziva is only one of", "98:16", "the sixteen members I get that but if we", "98:19", "asked other members I think that they", "98:21", "would all say the

that would be a huge", "98:32", "disservice to my work I would not want I", "98:35", "would not have put one and put in a ton", "98:37", "of effort into something and then for", "98:39", "someone to only have you know that just", "98:41", "to pick up the part that you know that", "98:43", "really depends on ORS nuance", "98:45", "honestly if I'd written the NASM report", "98:48", "the a.m. report

you know", "146:49", "cannabis can can help the opioid crisis", "146:51", "and then also to you you want to look at", "146:53", "it from a clinical perspective right so", "146:56", "we know that

mentioned", "158:05", "earlier is that you know some people", "158:06", "kind of had this personality where", "158:08", "they're like Andres parent right and", "158:10", "they they just they just want to want to", "158:12", "try something so you know the fact is", "158:14", "that alcohol and cannabis just get", "158:17", "introduced first most of time most", "158:19", "people you know don't do you know coke", "158:22", "or LSD and then he say hey man let us", "158:25", "try some some cannabis right so it's", "158:27", "just that that's the very first one", "158:29", "there so if we so you could say anything", "158:32", "that was easier access if there was some", "158:34", "new drug that you know did something", "158:37", "similar to alcohol or similar to", "158:38", "cannabis and that was

the people that you are and in your", "159:12", "book out right let me just go a little", "159:14", "bit further they said in a retrospective", "159:16", "cohort study may it from et al and the",

percent for", "162:28", "people who had suffered a TBI people who", "162:31", "test it I know you know we talked about", "162:33", "correlation causation but you know the", "162:34", "THC users only had a two point four", "162:38", "percent mortality rate the non T she was", "162:40", "just had 11.5% whatever I mean that's", "162:42", "really really significant right like", "162:44", "it's just
