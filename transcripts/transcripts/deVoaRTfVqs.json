in good condition no injuries", "27:40", "athleticism you're an athlete are you", "27:43", "good good athlete this is a physical", "27:45", "layer this is their the wider one that's", "27:47", "the bottom one it's like a pyramid then", "27:49", "it goes up one layer the technical layer", "27:52", "do you know what to do your knowledge do", "27:55", "you know a number defense to a triangle", "27:58", "choke how to counter a jab or how do you", "28:01", "you know technical aspect you know in", "28:03", "terms of knowledge of fighting that's", "28:05", "where that the trainer comes into play", "28:07", "also the physical the technical and a", "28:11", "lot of that trainer they don't have the", "28:14", "last layer or they only have one of", "28:17", "those or two of those but they don't", "28:18", "have the three layers", "28:20", "that's where feriss John and also I", "28:22", "would say Freddie and boxing comes into", "28:25", "play by an MMA especially for us and", "28:28", "John the tactical layer which is the", "28:31", "last one that's what separate contenders", "28:33", "and champion there's a physical the", "28:37", "technical and the tactical let's say", "28:40", "we're equal we're the same person", "28:43", "what can I make the difference between", "28:45", "me winning against you are you winning", "28:47", "against me the tactical because we're", "28:48", "the same person where I come", "28:50", "bleeped replicas were we're a clone that", "28:52", "the difference is the tactical I will", "28:55", "know how where I can take you out of", "28:58", "your comfort zone and I can bring the", "29:00", "fight where I'm the strongest and and", "29:02", "fight you to element eliminate the odds", "29:05", "were that the fight were will will will", "29:10", "slope the odds of me winning to my", "29:12", "advantage that's where John and Faris", "29:14", "our master at this and Freddie Roach is", "29:17", "master at this unboxing that's why I'm", "29:19", "so I feels very very lucky to have this", "29:23", "guy with me in in my corner because they", "29:27", "they they're competent in these three", "29:30", "layers physical technique technical and", "29:33", "tactical which most trainer can have", "29:36", "only one two or may they not have tree", "29:39", "is very rare to find treat that those", "29:42", "the trainer who can do the these three", "29:44", "thing so when you get to the tactical", "29:46", "layer is this something that you all", "29:48", "agree on they discuss it when we're", "29:51", "approaching a fight like say Michael", "29:52", "Bisping yeah like how do you how do you", "29:56", "do it you say this is what I see in his", "29:58", "fights and then for us gives his input", "30:00", "and John gives his input and then", "30:01", "Freddie gives his input yeah and you", "30:03", "start discussing what's the best way to", "30:05", "handle it so so coming into that fight", "30:07", "with Michael Bisping Michael whisper was", "30:09", "very well prepared was it's very various", "30:12", "as a very good team with Jason perello", "30:14", "so we were expecting you always have to", "30:18", "gauge also to know you and to know your", "30:21", "your opponent you know sometime knowing", "30:24", "you open it is easier than to knowing", "30:26", "yourself you know so you have to be", "30:29", "relaxed realistic about your strengths", "30:32", "and weaknesses and how you're gonna", "30:33", "match up against your opponent with", "30:37", "Michael Bisping what mess mess me up a", "30:40", "little bit is an and all of us is we", "30:43", "were expecting Michael Bisping to come", "30:45", "straight at straight at me try to to", "30:48", "take me out right away instead of that", "30:50", "it was moving especially more in the", "30:52", "second round so the first one was I was", "30:55", "doing well but in the second round start", "30:58", "moving away and be more did instead of", "31:02", "coming at me was more", "31:03", "trying to running away from me and", "31:05", "that's why a lot of people that said to", "31:07", "me as a man that a big because I lost a", "31:09", "second run against Michael Bisping and", "31:11", "people's like man what happened to you", "31:13", "it seems like you were you slow down a", "31:16", "little bit it's only that I saw Donna is", "31:17", "also I yeah I got hit with a very strong", "31:20", "right hand right on the bottom by a guy", "31:22", "who maybe outweigh me but 20 pounds you", "31:24", "know so it slows a man down something", "31:27", "like that my cardio was bad it's not I", "31:29", "was my cardio assignment we get punch on", "31:32", "the bottom it slowed him down and he", "31:34", "caught me off guard he changed his", "31:36", "strategy from round one to round two we", "31:38", "became more like it was more like a", "31:40", "runner instead of a hunter mm-hmm kind", "31:43", "of guy and so he caught you with the", "31:45", "counter shot", "31:45", "what he did is very smart he couldn't", "31:47", "get to me if you look at the replay of", "31:49", "the fight with Michael Bisping you", "31:51", "couldn't get to me straight to my head", "31:53", "was he's trying to hit me with his jab", "31:54", "with his strike tried to target my head", "31:56", "and but I was too fast for him so I", "31:58", "don't know if it's his trainer or him", "32:00", "who decide to change so he decided to be", "32:02", "like like a runner so I decided to try", "32:05", "to chase him a little bit more and what", "32:07", "happened to me he jabbed my my lead hand", "32:12", "which square me and then he connect me", "32:15", "straight on the on that chain well in", "32:17", "the same time I was trying to true a leg", "32:20", "kick", "32:20", "so it was a perfect timing beautiful", "32:22", "execution and I don't know if he", "32:24", "practice that but it was very well done", "32:26", "very smart so I've tried to target my", "32:28", "head II jab my my my hand and hit me", "32:31", "with the the the rear hand and that's", "32:34", "why I hurt me he heard me I try to put", "32:37", "that poker face on and during that fight", "32:38", "he heard me it's one of the strike that", "32:40", "hurt me the most", "32:40", "even though Michael Bisping is not known", "32:42", "as a knockout guy this this this shot", "32:45", "really hurt me because the precision was", "32:47", "the timing was good I've never", "32:48", "understood where people don't think he", "32:49", "hits hard look what he did to Brock hold", "32:51", "yeah he hits fucking hard it's I think", "32:53", "it's what hurt someone in a fight I mean", "32:56", "what can put our way someone is not", "32:57", "necessarily the power by this more", "33:00", "precision and timing and that particular", "33:02", "Ryan was perfectly time and with great", "33:06", "precision so that's why I got hurt and", "33:08", "you win their second round then had to", "33:09", "make adjustment for the third round", "33:11", "that's when for Freddie John and Ferris", "33:15", "come into play there were", "33:17", "what he was doing and they say after the", "33:19", "the ran just slip and come with the hook", "33:22", "over that up and there the right hand", "33:24", "and that's what I did and then knock him", "33:26", "down and and but in in a fight", "33:31", "whatever your trainer tells you if you", "33:34", "didn't practice it it's it's not gonna", "33:36", "work I mean you don't have time to think", "33:38", "it's it's a autopilot yeah so I was on", "33:41", "autopilot sometimes you just need some", "33:43", "some kind of guidance that put you back", "33:46", "your that put your autopilot in the", "33:49", "right direction it that's what happen", "33:50", "into that fight a reminder yes a little", "33:52", "reminder a we're not going this or going", "33:55", "this way our cage then you you then it's", "33:58", "still the autopilot but it's different", "34:01", "direction the crazy thing about Mike is", "34:03", "he", "34:04", "he has very poor vision in his right eye", "34:08", "a lot of people might not know about it", "34:11", "but in the vitor belfort fight he", "34:13", "damaged his retina very badly he said", "34:16", "several surgeries and he's got oil in", "34:18", "his eye that's sort of like protecting", "34:20", "it and he'll have it fixed once he's", "34:22", "done fighting but you know if you look", "34:24", "at him one of his eyes is darker than", "34:26", "the other eyes sure and that's that", "34:28", "right eye and did you particularly", "34:31", "target things going to that right side", "34:33", "like things off of your left side yeah", "34:35", "it's a lot of thing that would drill", "34:37", "done with the left hook that's why like", "34:40", "when I when I hit him with a left hook", "34:42", "that was a lot of times it does but the", "34:48", "thing is with Michael is he adjusts", "34:50", "himself very well to this you know like", "34:52", "like it's like a he knows it and", "34:54", "probably knows that himself or the way", "34:56", "he fights he adjusted very well you know", "34:58", "he put himself in a position that you", "35:00", "cannot get hit often with this you know", "35:03", "especially in my fight so I needed", "35:04", "almost to wait for him to commit with", "35:07", "the right hand to come over the top if", "35:09", "you look at that fight with Kevin gas so", "35:10", "let me the same thing he missed with the", "35:12", "right hand and then he got counter it's", "35:14", "always when he missed with the right", "35:15", "hand that he got count-out can Heartland", "35:17", "fight I think was a mistake it was a", "35:19", "mistake because he was not prepared for", "35:21", "this he didn't write what's also he just", "35:24", "got off of a crazy fight with you it was", "35:26", "bad I think it was a bad mistake for his", "35:28", "part but but look to his credit", "35:30", "he

that tomb that that knee", "176:08", "comes up and then boom it's all in", "176:10", "trusting that hip and popping it forward", "176:12", "and then once you develop the speed from", "176:14", "doing that then you do it with the turn", "176:16", "and then it's turn boom it's the same", "176:19", "thing it's that twist of the the hip and", "176:21", "the extension of the leg but then it's",
