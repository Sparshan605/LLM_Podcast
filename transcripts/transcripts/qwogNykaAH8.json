"17:08", "yes that was a cup of coffee and go like", "17:10", "whoa this coffee is good right you hear", "17:14", "that song yeah put up that video the", "17:17", "other day oh yeah that I reposted", "17:20", "vibrations and yeah if you look deep", "17:22", "into this topic of vibrations and", "17:24", "symbols that come out and like explain", "17:26", "what we're talking about the I posted it", "17:30", "on my Instagram I reposted it because", "17:32", "it's really fascinating this is black", "17:33", "man it's it seems like it's just a mat", "17:36", "that's charged yeah", "17:38", "vibrated let's explain what's happening", "17:40", "for the people who just not gonna play", "17:41", "this video cuz they're probably taking", "17:42", "down it's got a lot of views there's", "17:43", "lots of different versions of this", "17:45", "online it says amazing amazing amazing", "17:50", "resonance experiment so they put some", "17:52", "st. as its and this is probably salt", "17:54", "okay they put some sort of powdered", "17:58", "stuff sand or salt onto a black mat", "18:00", "that's charged and then they send", "18:02", "certain Hertz through it this one's 3835", "18:06", "Hertz and then it makes a different", "18:08", "patterns crazy on the look at this 3975", "18:12", "like every time they change the Hertz it", "18:15", "has a different paddle the 4049 look at", "18:18", "this pattern so the spirits are wait", "18:20", "that's unbelievable but yeah and these", "18:22", "are also you can take these numbers and", "18:25", "these can also be notes that's a dark", "18:28", "evening on a piano or used to hearing or", "18:30", "singing right so these can also be", "18:32", "recreated in other ways and are probably", "18:34", "happening right and to us you know", "18:37", "that's not like maybe one of those", "18:39", "earworm here like Victor you're in the", "18:42", "back your neck vibrate or something like", "18:44", "that", "18:44", "what if a certain Hertz just spelled", "18:46", "you're like your grandparents name well", "18:49", "what's interesting is that each one of", "18:50", "them are different geometric patterns", "18:52", "there are these beautiful patterns", "18:54", "they're gorgeous and as you change the", "18:56", "Hertz the patterns morph immediately", "18:59", "yeah and but the thing is they're kind", "19:02", "of fractal like not fractal but they", "19:04", "they seem to be what's the word e equal", "19:07", "in both sides is that way that this word", "19:09", "I'm looking for", "19:10", "mmm parallel no no I think you were", "19:12", "you're on the right topic if the numbers", "19:14", "a little more round like a round number", "19:16", "these are not specific Hertz like if you", "19:19", "do a specific likes winds different than", "19:22", "identical but anyway both sides are", "19:24", "exactly the same and it's separate in", "19:26", "this one they're not it's not separated", "19:27", "in a half it's it's it's all like the", "19:30", "circle is the center it all goes out", "19:33", "from there but they're different every", "19:34", "time but they're all even like see it", "19:36", "looks the only thing that's keeping it", "19:37", "from being perfect is that they run out", "19:39", "of sand and it looks like the power is", "19:41", "centered around the center part where", "19:43", "the wires are connected to so that's the", "19:44", "most potent but silicon beautiful so", "19:47", "that may like thing if you think about", "19:49", "that like in a", "19:50", "if there's a certain Hertz going through", "19:52", "the air like in space yeah then it would", "19:55", "form like a solar system I guess one", "19:58", "better the feeling that you get from", "20:01", "like Rocky right the feeling that you", "20:02", "get from that saw that things go your", "20:06", "body yes", "20:07", "yeah it could literally could be like a", "20:09", "little drug look think about why people",

you and me oh yeah oh god", "21:07", "it's it's amazing that we're considered", "21:09", "the same thing you know as what smart", "21:12", "people just really smart people yeah I", "21:13", "have someone like Sean Carolyn the", "21:16", "physicist and he has to break down", "21:18", "particle physics and shit to you you", "21:21", "like is it hard it doesn't even get in", "21:24", "yeah does it I can repeat what he said", "21:26", "yeah I don't the fuck it means when", "21:28", "people start talking about quantum", "21:30", "things in quantum theory and quantum", "21:32", "particles as danger dude I don't get I", "21:35", "don't trust that kind of stuff a lot of", "21:37", "it", "21:37", "well how about you know what", "21:38", "superposition is it's the ultimate what", "21:41",

"21:51", "you've created crazy scientists that I", "21:53", "don't understand yeah I would rather do", "21:55", "something more chill than that", "21:57", "what the fuck something can see yeah",

would do that the", "22:34", "reason why they would never do that is", "22:36", "because scientists whole deal is", "22:38", "figuring out shit that other scientists", "22:40", "didn't figure out that's like the best", "22:42", "thing they can do the best thing a", "22:44", "scientist can do is a real", "22:46", "honest-to-goodness breakthrough would", "22:49", "you have sex with a scientist

too", "22:58", "mysterious I bet they're clean", "23:00", "- if you fuck a scientist you know I bet", "23:01", "they have a clean apartment maybe but", "23:04", "maybe not maybe their fucking brain is", "23:06", "like that chalkboard with all the", "23:08", "squiggly alien mathematics are that's", "23:10", "true huh what shit tattoo does a bunch", "23:13", "of dirty math tattooed on their puss I", "23:15", "was reading another but I was reading", "23:17", "this things about Richard Fineman you", "23:19", "know who Fineman was fine was a", "23:21", "scientist he was a physicist and there",

are all", "29:02", "areas that if you don't work out at all", "29:05", "they could break susceptible they're", "29:07", "susceptible so yeah I would always", "29:09", "advise that someone does a bunch of", "29:11", "calisthenics particularly like like the", "29:14", "classics push-ups sit-ups bodyweight", "29:16", "squats chin-ups", "29:18", "those all those classics you do a lot of", "29:21", "those get you just get your body", "29:23", "accustomed to resistance training right", "29:26", "do that first then I would move from the", "29:28", "I would always start with a but with", "29:30",
