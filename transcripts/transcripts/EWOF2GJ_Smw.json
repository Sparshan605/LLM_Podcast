owed a very complex and", "06:41", "scientific explanation but the problem", "06:43", "is people think that sheds boring like", "06:45", "what I just said right now the majority", "06:47", "of people

you", "07:16", "can't do that but South Park is so", "07:19", "successful and it is so proven in the", "07:21", "market that they do that well when you", "07:22", "shows not proven you really can't it's", "07:24", "hard to like have your say as to how", "07:26", "things get done it's a complex dance and", "07:28", "I don't think we pulled it off but it's", "07:30", "part of the thing of creating something", "07:32", "with me try to create a show I feel", "07:34", "personally responsible for it though", "07:35", "because a lot of people got angry and I", "07:37", "think a lot of that anger could have", "07:39", "been avoided when I first started", "07:41", "looking at chemtrails online I too", "07:44", "believed that it was a possibility like", "07:47", "is it possible to just pull this off", "07:48", "right in front of our face they just", "07:49", "spraying the sky but they're not the", "07:51", "more you look into ego no this photos", "07:53", "from 1980 that show these contrails like", "07:55", "long ones that lingered in the sky", "07:57", "people say when we were younger they", "07:59", "didn't linger actually they did you just", "08:01", "don't remember", "08:01",

fuck remember that", "08:24", "shit do to learn I learned some stuff", "08:26", "from Duane bang comm today man the way", "08:29", "what would you forget it either man but", "08:30", "these these people that I'm talking to", "08:32", "there's a problem with doing this show", "08:34", "and this is why I don't know if I want", "08:35", "to continue doing I mean first of all", "08:37", "sci-fi hasn't asked me to do it again", "08:38", "but even if they do I have to really", "08:39", "think about how it's I don't think I'm", "08:41", "doing what I want to do I don't think", "08:43", "it's coming out the way I want it to", "08:44", "come out it's there's part of it that is", "08:47", "like there was an episode we did on", "08:48", "transhumanism it's all like complicated", "08:50", "the science of extending human life", "08:52", "okay I love that because I got to talk", "08:54", "to all these super intelligent people", "08:56", "and pick their brain and ask really", "08:57",

a", "09:24", "lot of that oh yeah that's true hundred", "09:25", "percent and there's also a lot of people", "09:26", "that really believe what they are saying", "09:29", "and it's not because they're

man I've been I've", "09:52", "believed in a lot of stupid shit in the", "09:54", "past you know that I I was convinced", "09:56", "probably betrayal is a thing I was talk", "09:58", "about this a thing called rods these is", "10:00", "this fucking they look like jellyfish", "10:02", "that fly through the air faster than you", "10:03", "could say this whole video on the", "10:05", "Roswell bronze then I watch the show", "10:06", "called Monster quest", "10:07", "what they showed what they really are", "10:09", "it's just a video artifact like when you", "10:11", "have a camera and it's going on slow", "10:13", "motion and something flies past in front", "10:14", "of it stretches the image out and make", "10:16", "it's a blur it's fucking blur so I was", "10:19", "convinced these things were flying", "10:20", "through the air all around us because I", "10:21", "had seen this video and I was like", "10:23", "looking for him dude the guy who made", "10:27", "this video does not want to admit that", "10:29", "they don't they don't exist not only", "10:31", "that he actually showed up at the UFC", "10:32", "Expo when I was doing a QA and he asked", "10:35", "he got in line and and said he needed to", "10:37", "talk to me about Roswell Rodney's come", "10:39", "on my podcast because they are real and", "10:41", "though those people on Monster quest", "10:43", "fucked him and they said I don't know", "10:46", "how they could have fucked him because", "10:47", "they basically showed the same scene", "10:49", "there was a campfire or a light and a", "10:52", "bunch of bugs were flying in front of", "10:53", "light and they set two cameras in front", "10:55", "of it", "10:55", "one of them was an HD super fast camera", "10:57", "to the use for like super slow-mo and", "10:59", "the other one was like a regular video", "11:00", "camera well the regular video camera", "11:02", "showed these rods", "11:03", "they're fly-in a crop because it's an", "11:04", "artifact and if you look at how its", "11:07", "flying across the video it's not flying", "11:08", "that fast like I can see it so how can I", "11:11", "not see it with my eyes but I can see it", "11:13", "on camera", "11:13", "and then the other one just showed it's", "11:15", "just bugs what did you see the", "11:17", "underwater ones and the space my choice", "11:20", "to reveal there is without a doubt um", "11:23", "information to government has been", "11:26", "hiding dude what you're doing right now", "11:28", "is called you're making a plea to", "11:30", "ridicule rods are just tiny chemtrails", "11:33", "um yeah he thinks they might as well be", "11:37", "you know I thought they were real man I", "11:39", "really did you know I I saw a video once", "11:41", "it showed that they were fucking", "11:42", "buildings on the moon like this fish", "11:45", "this fucking guy had he like had these", "11:47", "images even worse than that how about", "11:49", "the face of Mars how about that", "11:50", "motherfucker you ever see the face on", "11:52", "Mars yeah but this is images that people", "11:53", "swear to you the government is basically", "11:56", "doctored the second more high-resolution", "11:59", "images there was some photos they took", "12:00", "like a long time ago of Mars and as they", "12:03", "flew over Mars", "12:04", "it shows what looks like a five sided",

shit", "12:16", "I love this friend dearly dumb ass dumb", "12:18", "ass but he admits it was a mistake he", "12:21", "admits it but shit that shit's important", "12:23", "man it's as you clearly it's a face if", "12:26", "you look at the shape but does not", "12:28", "appear in nature this is either two eyes", "12:30", "bitch you don't know what the fuck", "12:32", "you're looking at okay you're looking at", "12:34", "a spot that you decided it's like", "12:36", "looking at the clouds and thinking that", "12:37", "you see in Dragons you know you also", "12:40", "could be seeing a fucked up cloud", "12:41", "because clouds aren't perfect", "12:44", "symmetrical squares you shithead", "12:46", "alright you're looking at something that", "12:48", "you barely tell what the fuck you're", "12:49", "looking at clearly for faith on Mars and", "12:51", "there's a dude who has these videos", "12:53", "where he measures like these arbitrary", "12:55", "distances like a few measure from the", "12:57", "nose to the left front center of that", "13:00", "pyramid it is the exact same distance as", "13:02", "the Sphinx to the Pyramid of Giza yeah", "13:05", "you know like how the fuck did you come", "13:07", "to that conclusion", "13:09", "if you look at it from the White House", "13:11", "in a 44 inch television in the corner", "13:13", "where Clinton used to get his blow jobs", "13:14", "that from that room clearly the pyramid", "13:17", "has a face on it it looks like numbers", "13:18", "on Mars I rest my case and then and", "13:21", "people fucking buy the DVD and call each", "13:23", "other on the phone and do this shit you", "13:25", "got to see this a man is dropping some", "13:27", "truth some mad truth about the pyramid", "13:29", "and the next thing you know you're", "13:31", "getting fucking email blasts have you", "13:32", "seen this about the pyramid like you", "13:34", "motherfuckers yeah", "13:36", "not a fucking face on the Mars there", "13:38",

more interesting than the the face", "13:48", "is the face when they show the", "13:50", "high-resolution image of the face these", "13:51", "are been doctored clearly doctored these", "13:54", "are not high-resolution photographs in", "13:56", "fact they are what less than half of the", "13:58", "gigabytes and it would be it was a true", "14:00", "85 Gila big old fucking picture but", "14:05", "there are some like symmetrical objects", "14:07", "that exist that do look like five sorry", "14:10", "pyramids like you pull up that kind of", "14:12", "images I can see that yeah it's", "14:13",
