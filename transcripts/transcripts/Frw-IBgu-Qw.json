did in the", "72:27", "first fight correct is I think is gonna", "72:29", "he's gonna stay on the outside use a jab", "72:31", "set him up he's gonna win rounds with", "72:32", "footwork in boxing and

fought Ruiz he was a", "74:13", "little thick I think he's lost little", "74:14", "blade himself I think one of the things", "74:17", "he's done is he's gone less strength and", "74:19", "conditioning and more pure box he was so", "74:22", "big he was talking about that he said", "74:23", "essentially his word the way described", "74:25", "it is I was listening to this interview", "74:27", "with him some English gentleman and he", "74:29", "was saying that you think about it you", "74:31", "have a hundred percent of your energy if", "74:33", "you put 50% of its strength conditioning", "74:34", "and 50% of it to boxing you're not going", "74:37", "to achieve the same amount of you put a", "74:38", "hundred percent to boxing something to", "74:40", "that effect yeah so the idea is he's", "74:41", "doing less roadwork he's doing more", "74:43", "conditioning in the gym and he's doing", "74:44", "like heavy bags man smart yeah it's", "74:46", "because if you look at you know in", "74:48", "degrees of advantages over and be speed", "74:50", "combinations so you", "74:52", "just be this big heavy bulker also if", "74:55", "you're looking at future matchups Fury", "74:56", "and

is the life", "76:04", "yeah that's possible you know but I", "76:07", "don't think so I think I think he's a", "76:10", "disciplined guy I think he just goes", "76:12", "wild and just can't be that discipline", "76:15", "with that body no no no he looks a", "76:17", "certain way that you're you're not gonna", "76:20", "get away with discipline doesn't come to", "76:23", "the food well it's not

"just I just I don't see it man it's it's", "76:49", "so interesting because it becomes as big", "76:51", "a fight as Wilder fury - it becomes a", "76:54", "giant fight while their fury - to me is", "76:56", "the heavyweight fight that's the", "76:58", "heavyweight fight I'm really interested", "76:59", "in this fight Joshua's third I thought", "77:01", "Josh or Joshua's like it used to be",

fight that I want to see", "77:10", "more than anything is wild of fury -", "77:12", "that's the number one - just because the", "77:14", "first one was so controversial and", "77:15", "fantastic so good and you know I", "77:18", "rewatched it yesterday in fact you can", "77:20", "make a real real solid argument that", "77:23", "Tyson Fury got robbed", "77:25", "a hundred percent they don't the only", "77:27", "argument for Deontay Wilder is you know", "77:30", "he did knock him down Oh dad if the", "77:33", "fight was a fight if it's a fight fight", "77:36", "you know like in the streets and - guys", "77:38", "were going at it like that and one guy", "77:40", "dropped the guy and blasted him and then", "77:41", "dropped him in the end and who's laying", "77:43", "on his back and he got up and they you", "77:45", "know at the end of the round they", "77:46", "decided that was the end of the fight", "77:48", "you would say man I think he won he", "77:49", "fucked that dude up but as far as boxing", "77:51", "rules goes and contests purely one that", "77:53", "fuck you ever won the box you're on", "77:55", "first", "77:55", "but Deontay Wilder I like to draw them", "77:57", "because jianci Walter had did the most", "77:59", "damage in the fight so I was like all", "78:02", "right when is the drum like oh I dig", "78:03", "that here's the argument against a draw", "78:06", "though he gets dropped", "78:07", "Tyson fearing is dropped in the the", "78:09", "final round right loses one point for", "78:11", "sure right it's definitely now a 10-8", "78:13", "round for Tyson for Deontay Wilder after", "78:16", "that knockdown is a bad knockdown but", "78:18", "then he gets up and wins the rest of the", "78:20", "rounds the wrestler so what do you say", "78:22", "there you give a point for that so you", "78:23", "know Fury won the fight so what is it", "78:25", "nine eight what is that then if it's a", "78:29", "10-point must system how does that work", "78:31", "does that mean then would it go back to", "78:33", "even can you have a seven seven round", "78:35", "you both drop each other twice I don't", "78:37", "think so I don't think so", "78:38", "no right what happens there do you ever", "78:40", "imagine guys but that wouldn't just go", "78:42", "back that you want to score that round", "78:44", "ten eight you'd do a ten shouldn't we", "78:45", "know this it just be a ten nine I should", "78:47", "I should definitely know this boxing", "78:49", "judges but even we use the same scores", "78:52", "in the UFC don't think dude it's
