be", "40:11", "on top you want to have the ball if", "40:13", "you're on top you're in someone's open", "40:15", "guard it's like you're on the 20-yard", "40:16", "line you get on the top half you're like", "40:18", "at the 50-yard line you pass the side", "40:20", "control you can score from side control", "40:22", "but it's a lot easier if you score from", "40:24", "the back so side controls like the 35", "40:27", "yard line the amount is like the 20 yard", "40:29", "like now you're in the red zone and if", "40:31", "you get to do its back first and go on", "40:33", "the 10 that's

the visiting team and then if", "40:59", "it's heads whoever wins the coin toss", "41:02", "gets to decide who receives and who", "41:05", "kicks off generally a large percentage", "41:08", "of the time if you win the coin toss you", "41:10", "say we're gonna receive and you're gonna", "41:12", "kick off we're gonna be on offense for", "41:14", "you're gonna be on defense first I'm", "41:16",

sometimes a", "41:33", "team will choose to kick off and not", "41:36", "receive", "41:37", "that's kind of like if we're gonna", "41:39", "grapple and I sit down I chose to play", "41:41", "defense first that's what a guard puller", "41:43", "is it doesn't happen that often so it's", "41:46", "penalizing someone one point for sitting", "41:49", "on their butt for letting the guy get on",

you're", "42:10", "gonna lose lose the advantage and points", "42:13", "doesn't make any sense", "42:14", "Youngstown as I could see yeah I could", "42:16", "see if so say if they don't have points",

"42:36", "be laughing it should be like this is", "42:38", "she there to be submission only that's", "42:40", "it and you have overtime rounds and I", "42:43", "could explain that if you want here but", "42:44", "generally have submission only no points", "42:46", "no advantages it's all about who gets", "42:49", "the submission the whole goal is to get", "42:51", "submission because in a lot of there was", "42:53", "epic matches there's incredible athletes", "42:56", "I have respect for all of them but when", "43:00", "you're under this rule set you there's a", "43:02", "lot of times in these matches where the", "43:05", "submission wasn't even a thought just", "43:07", "the W there were matches where like", "43:10", "three minutes left guys sat on his ass", "43:13", "he loses a point now I'm on top I want", "43:16", "to win that money at the end cuz the", "43:17", "winner of each division wins $10,000", "43:20", "he's the guy on top automatically is", "43:23", "gonna be very cautious reserved and", "43:26", "be aggressive and definitely not even", "43:30", "consider a submission it's all about the", "43:33", "W so that changes the entertainment", "43:37", "value and for me that's the most", "43:38", "important do you think that it should be", "43:40", "just submission only it's either", "43:44", "submission only or you really really", "43:47", "break down the point system for the way", "43:50", "it should be and this is the way it", "43:52", "should be like um in Dean Lister's match", "43:55", "against I forget who he lost there were", "43:57", "so many matches but he was down on", "44:00", "points and at the very end he put I", "44:04", "think it was you our sis he put him in a", "44:07", "triangle he had him in a sense triangle", "44:09", "at the very end and he was down by two", "44:12", "points maybe three I'm not sure on the", "44:15", "points but but he was down it was 30", "44:17", "seconds put him in a triangle in in my", "44:20", "eyes a triangle you should get more us", "44:24", "anything cinched like a triangle a", "44:25", "figure if your legs are cinched like you", "44:27", "have a guy in a triangle doesn't mean", "44:28", "he's gonna tap a lot of times some guys", "44:30", "escape but if it's totally cinch that", "44:32", "guy was in deep deep trouble", "44:34", "if he escapes he got lucky so that that", "44:38", "since triangle should represent way more", "44:41", "than a pass or a sweep that's just", "44:44", "common sense so in my eyes if you want", "44:48", "to score keep the scoring system and you", "44:50", "you're in love with you're gonna commit", "44:52", "to the scoring system really think about", "44:54", "the score how you score this if a pass", "44:57", "is three points if a sweep is two points", "45:00", "a cinched Darce which people escape half", "45:04", "the time but if you cinch it all the way", "45:06", "up and as a referee you should see if", "45:08", "it's a near sub if it's a cinch stars a", "45:11", "cinch triangle a cinched arm triangle a", "45:14", "straightened out arm like you straighten", "45:17", "the guy's arm and you escaped by the", "45:18", "skin of his teeth you straightened out", "45:20", "his leg like a knee bar he escaped by", "45:22", "the skin of his teeth you can see that I", "45:24", "wouldn't count heel hook and toehold", "45:25", "attempts cuz then that would you know", "45:27", "they're so easy to just to jump on and", "45:29", "then it turns into just a bunch of", "45:30", "footsies but if you I would count in my", "45:33", "world I would count so straight knee", "45:36", "bars straight arm bars anything cinched", "45:38", "any kind of", "45:40", "that should be seven points yeah I agree", "45:43", "with you son I think it should five", "45:45", "something yeah yeah a pass what is it", "45:48", "now it's one do you know anything", "45:51", "cinched is not an Abu Dhabi there's", "45:53", "nothing but it means nothing", "45:55", "wait a minute it means not that doesn't", "45:57", "make any sense it doesn't mean anything", "45:59", "so if a guy is a cinched in triangle", "46:00", "that's not a near submission that's", "46:04", "terrible Sharyn abhi it should be worth", "46:07", "way more than a sweep oh yeah without a", "46:10", "doubt", "46:10", "yeah well you look sweeps you know", "46:11", "people recover from sweeps but if", "46:14", "someone has you that close to being", "46:15", "tapped like a cinch three or naked or", "46:16", "some long those lines it's like a goal", "46:18", "yeah you might touched it you got

go as submission", "63:55", "only but the way everything in my mind", "63:58", "was all designed to create urgency for", "64:02", "the submission like the like for example", "64:04", "the ultimate urgency would be you do a", "64:07", "submission only match between two guys", "64:09", "and the winner gets one billion dollars", "64:11", "the loser gets nothing you imagined", "64:13", "urgency of that and how exciting that", "64:16", "obviously you don't really mean a", "64:18", "billion dollar I'm just saying I'm just", "64:19", "that's that's an example if you could", "64:21", "give them a

that spike is starting to", "65:01", "put glory on that yeah look like the", "65:03", "highest level kickboxing they're putting", "65:05", "down on TV I think one of these days", "65:06", "someone's gonna realize that watch like", "65:08", "that Kron Gracie Gary's opponent fight", "65:10", "yeah that kind of a match it's very", "65:12", "exciting let's say that okay", "65:13", "realistically 50 years or whatever", "65:15", "jiu-jitsu is mainstream you could do a", "65:18", "show where there's the 16 man tournament", "65:20", "submission only and the winner one", "65:23", "winner only it's

you'd have a", "65:36", "good matchmaker you put together you", "65:37", "know you don't just throw people", "65:38", "together but the X the amount of urgency", "65:41", "that there's gonna be for the submission", "65:44", "the training would be totally different", "65:45", "people would be specifically training", "65:48", "their setups - these submissions it", "65:50", "would be all about the submission right", "65:52", "now these guys getting the W and winning", "65:55", "by points is all that's necessary so", "65:57", "guys are specifically training for the", "66:00", "point system and I'm guilty of it - I", "66:02", "mean I mean if that's this if that's the", "66:05", "format there's how the I understand", "66:07", "because I do the same thing with the", "66:08", "mirror alarm he

struck me as", "131:45", "weird is it always feels like it's there", "131:47", "all the time yeah like whenever I do DMT", "131:50", "one of the weirdest things that happens", "131:51", "is just

two", "135:35", "magnets together you can't write it's", "135:37", "like you don't see anything there but", "135:38", "you just can't it just something solid", "135:40", "again if you flip it but you know what", "135:42", "I'm saying that there's nothing there", "135:44", "yet it's solid like they're saying", "135:46", "something's there but so maybe maybe", "135:48", "since we're all running
