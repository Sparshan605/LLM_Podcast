know", "11:54", "they're trying to shape my behavior with", "11:55", "it sort of like the science people that", "11:58", "tell their science are almost like", "12:00", "religious people that say this is our", "12:01", "story mm-hm and the fact is but there's", "12:03", "a bigger story than what you saw in the", "12:05", "book so is it just that it's not", "12:07", "measurable I mean well no it's",

but the", "84:27", "moment life starts to get too busy and", "84:30", "your mind starts to wander and think", "84:31", "then you start you go you resort back to", "84:34", "the unconscious programs well you didn't", "84:36", "see you did that but your partner does", "84:38", "and your partner goes what the hell kind", "84:39", "of behavior is that where'd that come", "84:41", "from and that's when this whole", "84:43", "honeymoon starts to come to an end", "84:44", "because when you just said whatever you", "84:46", "did from your subconscious program which", "84:48", "may have been your father or your mother", "84:49", "and you didn't hear yourself say it your", "84:51", "partner heard yourself say you didn't", "84:53", "even hear yourself saying that so that's", "84:55", "where all of a sudden the honeymoon", "84:56", "starts off start to collapse is like", "84:57", "what do you know what are you talking", "84:59", "about I've always been this way or", "85:00", "whatever you want to say it's like you", "85:03", "start losing a dialogue because you're", "85:04", "now talking from your subconscious", "85:06", "programs and but the whole point was", "85:08", "what when we did operate from the", "85:10", "conscious moment when we did stay in", "85:12", "that period we created heaven on earth", "85:15", "both health-wise and yeah but then she", "85:18", "got fat so bitching at me about shit -", "85:21", "I'm tired of the fucking texting my", "85:23", "friends no gonna probably talk to me", "85:27", "isn't that what happens though that you", "85:29", "guys get tired of their own bullshit", "85:30", "conscious my story no I want people to", "85:32", "you know traveling it's a utopian", "85:35", "concept because we were talking about is", "85:36", "this massive up beat up rise of", "85:39", "serotonin - absolutely dopamine", "85:41", "serotonin actually happens when you", "85:42", "first meet someone you want to fuck them", "85:44", "because you know no but the question is", "85:46", "the question is why did it disappear", "85:48", "though it disappeared because you when", "85:50", "you met that person both of you were", "85:52", "operating from your creative wishes and", "85:54", "desires when did it fall apart is when", "85:56", "the subconscious mind started to take", "85:58", "over more the operation because life", "86:00", "started to occupy your conscious mind", "86:02", "it's now travelling yeah that's when it", "86:05", "ended so you hit this perfect moment and", "86:06", "then life got in the way yeah and guess", "86:09", "what but if you reprogram the", "86:11", "subconscious mind to have the same", "86:12", "beliefs and wishes and desires that your", "86:14", "conscious mind has so that both Minds", "86:17", "have the same vision and destiny then", "86:19", "there's the honeymoon the rest of your", "86:21", "life it doesn't end then because you put", "86:24", "in your wishes and desires", "86:25", "so even when you're not paying attention", "86:27", "that's when your subconscious playing is", "86:29", "still going to play the same wishes and", "86:31", "desires that you want in your life", "86:32", "anyway but right now it plays the", "86:35", "programs that you got from other people", "86:37", "when you're not paying attention that's", "86:38", "why you lose control over your life said", "86:40", "I've only said that very few people have", "86:42", "their own opinions that they simply have", "86:44", "a conglomeration of other people's", "86:45", "opinions that sort of adopt it as their", "86:47", "own but they really haven't like audited", "86:50", "every single one of them down like a lot", "86:52", "of them yeah and try to figure out why", "86:54", "is that in there yeah and the problem", "86:55", "once it's downloaded then you become a", "86:57", "slave to the program even if you have no", "86:59", "desire to be in the program it's not", "87:02", "your choice now it's unconscious it'll", "87:04", "take you there whether you're paying", "87:05", "attention or not and don't you think", "87:07", "that same sort of thing has happened to", "87:09", "pretty much everyone who's in a position", "87:10", "of power so they are in a certain sense", "87:12", "a victim of the same system they've been", "87:14", "a rule of they were programmed somewhere", "87:16", "along the line to get to that power so", "87:18", "that they were being driven by the", "87:20", "program it's amazing when you really", "87:22", "think about it that you know but one of", "87:25", "the things I think is really terrifying", "87:26", "to people is that you're describing this", "87:29", "and people are realizing this I'm sure", "87:30", "right now but they're also realizing", "87:32", "this is not a conventional idea that's", "87:34", "really sort of pushed in the media this", "87:36", "is not something the president knighted", "87:37", "States addresses the nation about no", "87:39", "it's not necessarily something that's", "87:40", "there's no money well there's no money", "87:42", "for the corporations in this process and", "87:44", "when when the information is expressed", "87:47", "and you know and people know it to be", "87:48", "true sort of recognize it and think oh", "87:50", "my god does this mean that there was no", "87:54", "one who has set this whole gigantic", "87:56", "thing up this human civilization no one", "88:00", "did it consciously no one planned it out", "88:03", "they might have made the infrastructure", "88:04", "and planned out where the water was it", "88:06", "was going to go this way anyway it was", "88:08", "going to go this way", "88:09", "planned out yellow krisily", "88:11", "pattern we're playing a pattern and", "88:13", "here's the pattern civilization is a", "88:15", "living organism an animal and by its", "88:18", "definition it's going to evolve in the", "88:19", "same characteristic way that animals", "88:21", "evolved so there's a part we went from", "88:23", "let's say of fish amphibians reptiles", "88:26", "birds and mammals the fish phase was", "88:28", "when human civilization Early's phase", "88:30", "mariculture they lived at the sea they", "88:32", "they had to live at the water they they", "88:34", "couldn't live without water they were", "88:35", "stuck to wherever the water was", "88:36", "agriculture was amphibian phase why they", "88:39", "took the water with him on the land so", "88:41", "they could go deep into the land", "88:42", "penetrate in land get the water grow all", "88:45", "the stuff and live because you needed", "88:46", "the water ok the reptile stage reptiles", "88:51", "are the only animals that were first", "88:52", "designed for land they're almost like", "88:54", "machines they're almost mechanical like", "88:56", "when you see a lizard like it's almost", "88:58", "digital the way it moves the reptiles", "89:01", "were the equivalent of the Industrial", "89:02", "Age that's when we became reptilian and", "89:05", "it's interesting because we're still in", "89:06", "that age and guess what we're fueling", "89:08", "this civilization with with what they", "89:10", "call the the blood of the dinosaur we're", "89:13", "fueling it with oil which is the", "89:14", "character of that that reptilian phase", "89:17", "and and so we're living a reptilian", "89:20", "phase of civilization the lizards were", "89:22", "like mom-and-pop shops but they grew", "89:25", "into dinosaurs which were corporations", "89:27", "and the corporation's evolved and then", "89:29", "here comes the cool part the bird phase", "89:32", "of women's civilization started in 1903", "89:34", "when Wilbur and Orville Wright started", "89:36", "to fly it changed the whole world", "89:38", "because now you can fly around in a few", "89:40", "hours a change the world was so massive", "89:43", "at one point nobody could imagine it now", "89:44", "we could fly around and put a satellite", "89:46", "around it and I say so the birds evolved", "89:49", "from 1903 but guess what they reached", "89:50", "their fullest evolution in 1969 1969 the", "89:56", "birds landed on the moon and they took a", "89:58", "picture of the earth and those hippies", "90:02", "back then saw this picture and created", "90:05", "Earth Day within to within a month or", "90:07", "two of the picture coming back number", "90:09", "one number two they said oh man look at", "90:12", "that we got to take care of that that's", "90:14", "all we have got to take care of the", "90:16", "water the air take care of the kids and", "90:18", "all that", "90:18", "taking care is the character called", "90:21", "nurturing", "90:22", "nurturing is the character of mammals so", "90:26", "in 1969 the

were you know the big big", "90:46", "killer things and the mammals were the", "90:47", "little meek furry guys right and the", "90:50", "fact is that they talked about the meat", "90:53", "taking over the earth while we're in", "90:54", "that transition the dinosaur is falling", "90:57", "the oil is running out the you know the", "91:01", "power that's been feeding this whole", "91:03",

"91:34", "about that is I believe a lot of that we", "91:38", "translate the Bible whatever people", "91:40", "think today an issue is maybe they were", "91:43", "writing about real shit back then that", "91:45", "really happened something happened here", "91:46", "on this planet enough people occurred in", "91:48", "that biblical time period globally and", "91:50", "things shifted on the do you think it's", "91:53", "possible that this has happened before", "91:54", "that we just fucked the whole thing yes", "91:56", "and almost start from scratch yes yes", "91:58", "Wow it seems like a invisible Lemuria", "92:01", "Atlantis and those are natural exact", "92:04", "disasters well that's what they what we", "92:06", "believe but we don't know about the loom", "92:08", "Orion was more of the natural disaster", "92:10", "what about the Atlantis one still don't", "92:12", "know what actually thought they thought", "92:13", "it was a tsunami they found it in Spain", "92:15", "remember well they're finding pieces all", "92:16", "over because of finding now every that", "92:18", "the were let the water level is much", "92:20", "higher than it used to be a long time", "92:21", "ago and so and everything just like now", "92:23", "we live on the edges so yeah water level", "92:26", "raises than anything on the edges", "92:27", "doesn't exist anymore", "92:28", "so we lost it all at some point but", "92:30", "there's a time that this has happened", "92:33", "before the Mayans know this the ink", "92:36", "I mean they created buildings that were", "92:39", "completely earth proof designed", "92:41", "earthquake proof and they are they", "92:44", "already knew that this would this world", "92:45", "was just going to shake and do all this", "92:46", "kind of stuff suppose how did they make", "92:48", "earth proof shit earthquake if you look", "92:51", "at these giant giant blocks I mean", "92:54", "they're so big by human size I mean", "92:56", "they're massive stones they're cut with", "92:58", "very intricate angles and the point", "93:00", "about it is they're designed that if the", "93:02", "wall shakes the stones loosen up but", "93:05", "then they'll all settle back down into", "93:08", "the original resting position what's", "93:09", "really absolutely as we design this", "93:13", "knowing full well that these massive", "93:14", "earthquakes we're going to move these", "93:16", "boulders size building blocks and yet", "93:19", "they're designed so they're their angles", "93:21", "are cut so that they loosen up and on", "93:23", "earthquake and then fall back into", "93:25", "everything slides back into the the", "93:28", "right you know the right structure was", "93:30", "before that's amazing", "93:32", "it's amazing that they somehow another", "93:33", "figure that out it was interesting", "93:35", "because they built a when the Christians", "93:37", "came into the Spanish and they they took", "93:39", "over the Sun temple which is this big", "93:41", "Peruvian temple in Cusco then the church", "93:46", "did it and like dogs pee one on top of", "93:48", "the other one they built their church on", "93:50", "top of the foundation which was the", "93:53", "Peruvian temple they built the church on", "93:55", "Wow", "93:55", "and it's interesting three earthquakes", "93:56", "have demolished the church each time and", "93:59", "in three earthquakes not one thing", "94:01", "happened to to the foundational building", "94:03", "which was the Peruvian temple Wow", "94:05", "yeah that's amazing yeah totally they", "94:08", "knew all this stuff", "94:09", "there was great technology there was a", "94:10", "lot of stuff happening in those there's", "94:12", "something that there are civilizations", "94:14", "that we don't talk about in history", "94:15", "books our history book talks about oh", "94:17", "the Middle East Babylon and all that", "94:20", "kind of stuff it's a source it's like", "94:21", "there were civilizations that were here", "94:23", "and died out that were much more", "94:25", "advanced before that blew that yeah oh", "94:28", "they got enough archaeology I'm just", "94:29", "showing that now yeah there's there's", "94:31", "definitely some evidence that points to", "94:33", "that a new everything is being revised", "94:35", "that's the greatest thing about that", "94:36", "every part of our knowledge is being", "94:38", "revised that's another thing that people", "94:40", "are fighting against you know when you", "94:41", "were talking about people who are", "94:43", "academics have been teaching a certain", "94:45", "thing most of their lives you know that", "94:46", "happened with a lot of this", "94:48", "trying the people that are trying to", "94:49", "predate the Sphinx you'll wear well oh", "94:51", "yeah yeah that's a to me that's a", "94:54", "perfect example because these people", "94:56", "these Egyptologists were like you know", "94:57", "where is this evidence of this culture", "94:59", "and they're you know and like been how", "95:00", "much evidence you really think there", "95:02", "would be for if you're really talking", "95:04", "about thirty four thousand years ago", "95:05", "something like that like how much", "95:06", "evidence is there going to be it was", "95:08", "really going to be anything better than", "95:09", "blocks a stone I mean when we let go of", "95:11", "a city how long does it take before", "95:12", "other things back into sand again it", "95:15", "doesn't take long", "95:15", "no not all good all mean how long would", "95:17", "a car last and left a car outside a", "95:19", "little last even I'm only able to have a", "95:22", "few cars I've left in the woods that are", "95:23", "probably not there
