"06:06", "mongering but in fact that that is what", "06:09", "you have to do is a kind of a triage and", "06:12", "you know South Korea's has been pretty", "06:14", "good about this you know testing", "06:16", "everybody they jumped on it right away", "06:17", "they did that track and trace that you", "06:21", "know they got it right down to I think", "06:23", "it was the 31st patient they found who", "06:27", "had gone to to church services and then", "06:29", "she was in a car accident and taken to", "06:31", "the hospital and and that's when it", "06:33", "spread from there that that one day I", "06:35", "think it was in late February where that", "06:37", "when that happened and they just jumped", "06:39", "jumped all over it total deaths in South", "06:41", "Korea I think is like two", "06:42", "a couple hundred compared to most other", "06:45", "countries so this is a ways it is and", "06:48", "they've been you know super careful", "06:49", "about isolating people and targeting the", "06:51", "people that most need the tests and so", "06:53", "on and you know that's just the kind of", "06:55", "thing I think we have to do what do you", "06:57", "think about what's going on in Germany", "06:58", "because Germany is very fascinating", "07:00", "right it's I mean some of these European", "07:02", "countries particularly Italy are", "07:03", "experiencing this very high death rate", "07:05", "but Germany I mean they must have", "07:07", "exemplary health care they must be doing", "07:10", "something right or be robust and healthy", "07:12", "individuals is it a genetic thing you", "07:14", "think is it a healthcare thing because", "07:17", "they have a very low death rate I think", "07:20", "they have a high tight culture a very", "07:22", "tight culture that is when my wife's", "07:24", "from Cologne Germany so I know this from", "07:26", "personal experience with also their", "07:27", "studies Michele gelfand does these", "07:30", "studies on loose and tight cultures and", "07:32", "that Germany is a very tight culture", "07:33", "that is to say very law and order", "07:35", "law-abiding and you know when the German", "07:37", "government says alright this is what", "07:38", "we're gonna do people do it and", "07:41", "Americans are not that we're much looser", "07:43", "culture more freedom oriented and if the", "07:45", "government says you can't go to the", "07:47", "beach like well the hell with it I'm", "07:48", "going the beach anyway Germans don't do", "07:50", "that and they do have a really good", "07:52", "health care system and they jump right", "07:53", "on it and I think that's one explanation", "07:56", "you know we've seen yesterday this rise", "07:58", "in deaths of African Americans versus", "08:01", "you know white Americans yeah and having", "08:03", "to do with income but of course money is", "08:06", "just a proxy for something else which", "08:08", "has to do with the quality of the health", "08:09",

"08:20", "line when you're attacked by a virus", "08:23", "like that can have an effect on your", "08:25", "immune system and therefore the response", "08:26", "to the disease so I think those are the", "08:30", "kinds of cohorts we're gonna have to", "08:32", "target to save lives and I think", "08:35", "countries like South Korea and Germany", "08:37", "have been doing that pretty well without", "08:39", "pushback yeah I'm hoping my best hope", "08:43", "out of this is that it's a wake-up call", "08:45", "for people that don't take care of their", "08:46", "bodies the people that get through this", "08:48", "like you you dodged the bullet now let's", "08:51", "clean that diet up let's get you moving", "08:53", "let's start some exercise on a", "08:55", "regular weekly basis

immune system let's pump", "09:06", "everything back up to sustainable levels", "09:09", "and I mean that very well could be the", "09:11", "difference between people who contract", "09:12", "this virus and survive versus people who", "09:14", "contract this virus and don't absolutely", "09:17", "I mean how could it not hurt to be", "09:19", "healthy fit and have a good immune", "09:22",

the only", "11:19", "time I don't do that is when I have", "11:21", "explosive work that I'm doing in the", "11:23", "morning like if I'm doing my tie or", "11:24", "something like that that requires like a", "11:26", "lot of work then I'll just have a couple", "11:27", "pieces of fruit but I keep it pretty", "11:29", "light mmm but other than that I'll try", "11:31", "to do 16 hours I'm doing a I

just it becomes", "11:42", "normal the other thing I did that I've", "11:45", "been recommending that people that are", "11:47", "not into cycling or something like that", "11:49", "is I got these wrist and ankle weights", "11:51", "just at the local sporting goods store", "11:54", "but you can order them on Amazon just", "11:55", "five pounds each wrist five pounds each", "11:58", "ankle and

"12:22", "get the heart rate up work the big", "12:24", "muscles and you know circulate the blood", "12:27", "and all the bodily fluids and so on and", "12:29", "that's just good for general health and", "12:31", "I do think that has to help for response", "12:33", "to the coronavirus again these", "12:36", "populations that are more targeted you", "12:39", "know they you know there's a lot of", "12:40", "obesity and and you know diabetes and", "12:43", "some of these other secondary you know", "12:45", "these pre conditions as they call them", "12:47", "and you know there's this peculiar thing", "12:49", "we're all doing now like what I've done", "12:51", "for years is you look in the obits and", "12:53", "you see okay well this guy he was older", "12:55", "than me or he had this or he had that", "12:56", "doesn't apply to me you know we all do", "12:58", "that with the corona bike okay oh that", "13:00", "person was old or they had this", "13:01", "precondition and so on you're hope", "13:02", "you're hoping that somehow I'm gonna", "13:04", "dodge that this bullet because of that", "13:06", "it may not be but it's all a game of", "13:09", "probabilities of just stacking the odds", "13:11", "in our favor you know who knows if", "13:14", "that'll make a difference for you or me", "13:15", "personally but on average it's got to", "13:17", "make a difference this is a it's such a", "13:19", "strange virus isn't it in terms of", "13:22", "the way so many people are asymptomatic", "13:24", "yeah so I this idea that it came to", "13:27", "America of what January 28th or", "13:29", "something in Seattle I have a feeling", "13:31", "it's going to turn out to been earlier", "13:33", "like in December I was reading this", "13:36", "nature paper on the origins of the virus", "13:39", "they were sort of debunking the myth", "13:40", "that it was a creation of a you know bio", "13:44", "weapons lab in China there is that", "13:46", "conspiracy theory which is not", "13:47", "completely crazy because of course there", "13:49", "are there are bio weapons labs that do", "13:51", "this kind of stuff there was that one in", "13:52", "Russia a few decades ago where they had", "13:54", "a leakage but but it looked like I've", "13:57", "read this article twice I don't", "13:58", "understand because this isn't what I do", "14:00", "but you know they they really showed", "14:01", "that it very very likely made the leap", "14:04", "from probably bats", "14:06", "you know bats are mammals bats are very", "14:08", "response bateau II they're they're very", "14:11", "social you know there's this cave in", "14:13", "Texas where there's like 20 million bats", "14:16", "that live in this cave I mean they're", "14:18", "just pressed in it's like the same", "14:19", "population of Mexico City and they come", "14:22", "out at night and so on and you know", "14:24", "these wet markets and one-china it's", "14:26", "it's not that wet markets by themselves", "14:28", "are bad but you know say you have dead", "14:29", "fish it's a wet market but live animals", "14:32", "and particularly mammals like bats then", "14:35", "it's easy to make that that leap so you", "14:38", "know the corona buyer it's you know it's", "14:39", "a it's an they call it a novel", "14:40", "coronavirus for a reason it's novel you", "14:43", "mean there's other coronaviruses around", "14:45", "yeah common cold is a corona virus and", "14:47", "you know so there's I have a I have a", "14:49", "feeling Joe we're gonna have this virus", "14:52", "with us permanently I mean this is what", "14:53", "bouchy has been saying that it's not", "14:54", "gonna just go away and then we're done I", "14:57", "think we're gonna have probably a", "14:59", "mutated more modest strain of it forever", "15:02", "and we'll just have to get our flu shots", "15:04", "for that one every year and and you know", "15:07", "just kind of mitigate it that way yeah", "15:10", "if you've been paying attention to this", "15:12", "these potential remedies like", "15:13", "hydroxychloroquine makes me see packs", "15:15", "and and and zinc what do you thoughts on", "15:18", "that I took it for two days did you yeah", "15:20", "I did yeah", "15:21", "well a couple I know maybe a month ago", "15:23", "now my doc who's also a good friend and", "15:25", "a fellow cyclist he he's the guy that",

are", "64:02", "different some are more diverse some are", "64:03", "more homogeneous you have to account for", "64:05", "that and on and on so here I think you", "64:08", "know instead of thinking of

it's", "105:03", "like right okay therein lies the problem", "105:06", "just we just don't know these other", "105:08", "people okay so we stereotype them and", "105:11", "you know that's part of our

every year to to go birding and", "105:47", "then now been doing anthropology work as", "105:49", "well but back in the day he said they", "105:51", "would go out birding and he'd have one", "105:53",

who that guy is", "106:09", "and probably you might be eaten as well", "106:12", "not just killed so you know but the", "106:17", "point of Jared's story is that that's", "106:18", "the environment in

you know immigrants", "107:12", "are dangerous people or brown people are", "107:13", "dangerous whether you know white", "107:14", "supremacists do that and you know that", "107:17", "so that's a

this", "107:43", "house the moment the shit hit the fan", "107:45", "she goes we got to get a gun that was a", "107:47", "hit he was laughing he's like she told", "107:49", "me to get a gun you believe this and he", "107:52", "grew up in the south so he's used to", "107:54", "being around guns but this is this is", "107:57", "when people realize like well there's a", "107:59", "reason why people are Preppers some of", "108:02", "them are insane yeah but it's also hey", "108:04", "if the fucking grid goes down there's no", "108:07", "power you should have a certain amount", "108:10",

"108:19", "gotten a ton of questions from people on", "108:21", "how do you get into hunting how do you", "108:23", "get into hunting like and it's like it's", "108:26", "a complex question it's a long road it's", "108:29", "not an easy thing to learn how to hunt", "108:31", "but from people that never had any", "108:33", "interested in it before but now they", "108:35", "realize like hey I went to the grocery", "108:36", "store today and there's no fucking meat", "108:38", "like I want meat like what what do I do", "108:41", "for food like oh there's animals roaming", "108:43", "around that's what okay how do you get", "108:44", "these animals like what are you doing", "108:46", "and it's you know you realize why people", "108:49", "hold on to certain beliefs that some", "108:52",

"109:01", "thinks that everybody else wants to do", "109:02", "yes but of course they want to do that", "109:04", "the solution is you just put limits it's", "109:06", "like hunting hunting licenses and you", "109:08", "have a limit to how many you can shoot", "109:10", "and so on you know yeah and and lots of", "109:13", "industries have adopted that to solve", "109:15", "the tragedy of the Commons problem my", "109:18", "local Vaughn solved it by saying you can", "109:20", "only buy one packet of toilet paper per", "109:23", "shopper per day that's it and and I", "109:25", "think

"about that asshole taking two and I get", "109:34", "none yeah and you know and and really", "109:37", "it's even if you buy say well we're just", "109:40", "selfish creatures yeah we are that's", "109:42", "right but we're all but we also want to", "109:44", "do the right thing but we need some kind", "109:46", "of norms and laws and customs or", "109:48", "whatever in place to kind of attenuate", "109:51", "the inner demons and accentuate the", "109:53", "better angels and that everybody can see", "109:55", "that and then they feel better about", "109:57", "like okay I'm just gonna buy one and I", "109:59", "can a hoard or whatever now you", "110:00", "mentioned the south there's interesting", "110:02", "research Richard Nisbett and his", "110:04", "colleagues on the culture of

more gun", "110:33", "violence in the south there's kind of a", "110:34", "logic to it and that so it is but did", "110:37", "these famous experiments that are kind", "110:38", "of amusing now where you'd have subjects", "110:40", "come in and fill out a form for some", "110:43", "fake experiment they were doing and then", "110:45", "you have to walk down the hall and give", "110:47", "the form to the person in that room too", "110:49", "at the end of the hall we're in the", "110:51", "hallway there's like a bank of lockers", "110:53", "or filing cabinets or something and", "110:55",

"experiment kind of leans back and bumps", "111:05", "into this person and says asshole so the", "111:09", "question is what does this person do now", "111:10", "so anyway they do all follow-up surveys", "111:13", "and they drew blood and all this stuff", "111:14", "people from the notes too", "111:16", "from the north were like you know", "111:18", "whatever I don't you know I don't care",

mad", "111:26", "and then when they drew the blood their", "111:28", "stress hormones were higher testosterone", "111:29", "was higher and so anyway his theory is", "111:32", "that the sat that democracy came late to", "111:37", "the southern United States the rule of", "111:38", "law and the idea that the state has a", "111:42", "monopoly on the legitimate use of force", "111:44", "which is how government is defined and", "111:47", "and therefore southerners had to kind of", "111:50", "take the law into their own hands that", "111:52", "is to say you know we're gonna develop a",
