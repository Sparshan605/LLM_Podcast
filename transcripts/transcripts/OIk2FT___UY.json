know if I was", "00:57", "like this is it it's something I have to", "00:59", "conquer then I would have to learn how", "01:01", "to ice skate was much more exciting as a", "01:03", "youth yeah fucking roller like not", "01:07", "rollerblading fucking ice skating -", "01:09", "Green Day shit like that either I mean", "01:13", "that's right they play loud music and", "01:15", "you spin around

feedback", "03:05", "I'm getting from the universe well this", "03:07", "is like that book that you introduced me", "03:08", "to which I wore of art another book of", "03:11", "five rings oh the real one and the one", "03:13", "that talks about how you should just", "03:16", "learn anything like good at anything it", "03:18", "doesn't matter what the thing is that", "03:20", "you're getting good at because if you", "03:21", "understand how to get good at this one", "03:22", "thing you can extrapolate from that how", "03:25", "to get good at almost anything there's", "03:27", "these recurring

improve and a lot", "04:44", "of and everything in general I mean", "04:47", "there's there's arguments in", "04:48", "anthropology that actually there were", "04:50", "lots of societies that had a

any", "05:30", "refrigeration right depending on you", "05:33", "know depending on your climate I mean", "05:34", "they could they could dry things and be", "05:36", "certain yeah certain things but clearly", "05:38", "clearly not another frigid area around", "05:39", "the corner but you know what you're", "05:42", "talking about about whether it's cities", "05:44", "are just modern society that

you know it's part of why", "06:11", "they garden it's part of why they raise", "06:12", "chickens it's part of why they do all", "06:14", "sorts of other things that you", "06:15", "understand and

is", "07:13", "if religion exists does it confer an", "07:16", "adaptive advantage to people and so", "07:18", "there is some work done by a good friend", "07:20", "of mine David Sloan Wilson an",

byproduct of evolution in other", "07:51", "words it's something that evolved not", "07:53", "because itself it confers an adaptive", "07:55", "advantage but rather it's piggybacking", "07:57", "so for example the fact that your", "07:58", "skeletal system is the color that it is", "08:00", "that itself is not adaptive it is a", "08:03", "byproduct of other evolutionary", "08:05", "processes so

"piggybacks on that right it takes that", "08:27", "computational system that already exists", "08:28", "in us and it it puts it on steroid right", "08:31", "so do you think about the Abrahamic", "08:33", "religions right every one of them has us", "08:35", "versus them they are the Jews the", "08:37", "Gentiles the believers the Kufa right", "08:40", "and so agency detection detecting agency", "08:44", "in things is something that is innate to", "08:46", "us religion plays on that the agent", "08:49", "becomes God and so that's an argument", "08:51", "that was proposed by Pascal",
