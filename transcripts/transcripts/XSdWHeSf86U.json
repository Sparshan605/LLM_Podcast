has", "09:36", "taken off", "09:37", "I get like residual gratitude from float", "09:41", "places like I know you know Joe Rogan", "09:43", "you can float for free well that's", "09:45", "amazing well the thing is it just didn't", "09:48", "make any sense to me that before I was", "09:50", "talking about it no one was talking", "09:51", "about it this was something that was", "09:52", "invented by

you you know and then he figured", "10:03", "out the salt thing and I mean the fact", "10:07", "that this was not a popular thing was", "10:09", "blowing me away well it was but then it", "10:11",

an", "10:30", "interesting thing that people just kind", "10:32", "of push all that shit aside they know", "10:35", "him as the float guy invented floating", "10:36", "with dolphin gun and the dolphin guy but", "10:38", "also they completely leave out that he", "10:41", "was going into those tanks and claiming", "10:43", "some kind of communication with", "10:44", "something called the ECC or something", "10:47", "ecco you know about that yeah the earth", "10:49", "coincidence control office or something", "10:51", "you know about that zen center of the", "10:53", "cyclone yes yeah but he was going way", "10:56", "out talking about some kind of like", "10:59", "invisible", "11:00", "I guess network that produces", "11:03", "coincidences I don't understand it at", "11:06", "all but people just completely leave", "11:09", "that out that the guy who created float", "11:11", "tanks was using them to communicate with", "11:13", "entities and he was using a lot of", "11:17", "ketamine a lot of ketamine yeah or maybe", "11:19", "they're leaving out that the guy who", "11:20", "invented float tanks lost his shit there", "11:22", "toward the end well maybe but I think", "11:25", "that", "11:26", "I don't know what's happening when", "11:27", "you're doing psychedelics but there are", "11:29", "certain psychedelics where it absolutely", "11:32", "feels like you're experiencing another", "11:34", "life form communicating with you for", "11:36", "sure for sure right now if that's the", "11:38", "case of ketamine as well ketamine seems", "11:40", "to be like me personally my personal", "11:42", "bias I sort of dismiss it because I", "11:44", "think of it as some sort of chemical", "11:46", "compound thing some sort of a synthetic", "11:49", "thing that man's create like a demean", "11:51", "and what it's reliable but I think", "11:55", "that's just my own ignorance I think", "11:56", "really it we're just talking about", "11:58", "chemicals right and how chemicals that", "12:01", "exist in nature it's like when someone", "12:02", "says it's an artificial chemical well", "12:04", "that's not real because everything is", "12:06", "natural everything's here like it may", "12:09", "have been concocted and put together and", "12:10", "baked and cooked and synthesized by a", "12:12", "person but of course it's all natural", "12:14", "everything that's

something similar to the", "12:29", "molecule yeah yeah and it's some natural", "12:31", "thing like that's the craziest thing", "12:33", "about the most potent drugs whether it's", "12:35", "psilocybin or whether it's", "12:36", "dimethyltryptamine they have like really", "12:40", "similar composition to normal human", "12:43", "neuro chemistry right they're like keys", "12:45", "like their keys that a certain lock", "12:47", "that's how they put it yeah but I do", "12:48", "think that there is a distinction", "12:50", "between natural and unnatural in the", "12:52", "sense that something because I get this", "12:55", "argument all the time right oh people", "12:56", "created it so it's natural but there are", "12:59", "things that exist in the natural system", "13:02", "like plastics don't exist in the natural", "13:04", "ecosystem and therefore they don't break", "13:06", "down they don't become part of the food", "13:08", "chain in a beneficial way whereas things", "13:10", "that have existed in that system for a", "13:12", "long time do they fit into it and I", "13:15", "think in terms of drugs there are drugs", "13:17", "like GHB that exist naturally in the", "13:20", "body that we metabolize absolutely", "13:22", "cleanly because the liver knows exactly", "13:24", "what it is it's prepared to deal with it", "13:26", "and it doesn't cause any organic", "13:29", "toxicity no neurotoxicity but then there", "13:32", "are other things like alcohol which are", "13:34", "natural in a sense that fruits ferment", "13:37", "and all that but the body doesn't", "13:39", "metabolize it cleanly so it damages us", "13:41", "in particularly if you're from a very", "13:43", "specific part of the world right where", "13:45", "it's a if it's not a part of

know Hamilton", "13:56", "Morris the vice guy he tweeted this", "13:59", "thing I thought was pretty smart", "14:00", "probably a little controversial forgive", "14:01", "me if I miss quote it but

okay you can", "14:13", "call it plant medicine or you can call", "14:15", "it whatever you want but to create a", "14:16", "hierarchy based on synthesis I think is", "14:20", "to sort of miss the point which is that", "14:22", "all of these things are tools and some", "14:25", "of them we have more of a history with", "14:27", "humanity and some of them we don't the", "14:29", "ones we don't

what if this state is an", "26:24", "expression of that sense of community as", "26:26", "it is in a country like Denmark for", "26:28", "example sure where Danish people and", "26:30", "Dutch people and Swedish people and you", "26:32", "know lots of northern European countries", "26:34", "said you know we're not going to let", "26:36", "anyone be homeless and suffering we're", "26:38", "not

here", "147:28", "but I thought to myself I'm gonna miss", "147:31", "my friends if I have to hang out in this", "147:34", "place because the interesting thing", "147:36", "about DMT is that there's a sense of", "147:38", "I've heard other people report this a", "147:39", "sense of incredible familiarity or your", "147:42", "legs I have been here in fact this is", "147:45", "home and then you

out with my friends", "148:11", "and that's when I realized oh fuck I get", "148:14", "reincarnation man I get it this thing", "148:16", "you're talking about the simulator then", "148:18", "is going to happen sometimes and after", "148:21", "having taken psychedelics you think no", "148:22", "no it's already fucking happened and", "148:24", "this thing that we're in right now are", "148:26",

that", "196:01", "it's nature and that is in that moment", "196:02", "and in that moment exists the only", "196:04", "reason where these Predators can exist", "196:06", "is because they have to be

seals live so I look it up online", "197:21", "harbor seals live about 25 to 30 years", "197:22", "I've seen a lot of seals lying around on", "197:25", "rocks having a good time not stressed",
