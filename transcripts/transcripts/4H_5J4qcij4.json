you got this desalinator that's", "02:53", "basically kind of in one of the central", "02:55", "compartment so it's probably like I", "02:56", "don't know maybe two feet by two feet", "02:58", "square

"03:22", "Celsius so 33 Fahrenheit me practically", "03:24", "frozen cold water and I think that was", "03:26", "kind of starting to tweak out the system", "03:28", "but drinking salt water as we got closer", "03:31", "it was like it was still potable but it", "03:32", "was like this isn't working as well but", "03:34", "early on I mean it worked just fine like", "03:35", "it was pretty much you know cold cold", "03:37", "drinking water like bottled water yeah", "03:39", "exactly", "03:39", "but then does it only do it for a", "03:42", "certain amount of time does the filter", "03:43", "get filled up or anything it worked for", "03:45", "the entire 12 days that we were out", "03:47", "there those guys have gone on longer you", "03:49", "know rowing exhibitions across the", "03:50", "Pacific or the Atlantic or longer", "03:52", "stretches of ocean that you know you", "03:53", "works the entire time but it is one of", "03:56", "the things that breaks down so we had", "03:57", "extra spare parts fortunately we don't", "03:59", "have to use any of that but but ya know", "04:01", "it worked and then yeah of course we had", "04:03", "to bring food for the entire time as", "04:05", "well on there so that was you know a key", "04:08", "part of it how much food so there was", "04:11", "six of us like I said pretty much all", "04:13", "the compartments were full you know", "04:15", "there's a tiny little compartments we", "04:16", "basically ate two things so we we had", "04:19", "freeze-dried meals so like mountain", "04:20", "house freeze-dried meals we this little", "04:22", "Jetboil that we were kind of as crazy as", "04:24", "the waters like it's 40 you know a", "04:26", "40-foot wave", "04:27", "bouncing around on this trying to hold", "04:28", "in Jetboil to try to boil some water it", "04:30", "was pretty tough but some close calls", "04:32", "with that but we also had these bars so", "04:34", "last time I think we talked about last", "04:35", "time I was on here I had these kind of", "04:37", "custom nutrition bars that were made and", "04:41", "so that worked really well for me in the", "04:42", "Antarctica crossing we had done all this", "04:44", "kind of people explain that again like", "04:45", "how you made those made yeah so when I", "04:48", "was doing my own article crossing one of", "04:49", "the kind of challenges is basically can", "04:51", "you take enough food with you because", "04:53", "what I was doing was called unsupported", "04:54", "so no resupplies of food or fuel you", "04:56", "know crossing the landmass I'm a Nordica", "04:58", "54 days and so I wanted to get like the", "05:00", "most optimized nutrition and so I work", "05:02", "with this company called standard", "05:04", "process was all like a whole food", "05:05", "supplement company and they've got all", "05:07", "these sort of doctors food scientists", "05:09", "and this and I went in their lab for a", "05:10", "year and they did all this kind of", "05:12", "custom blood work on my body I'm trying", "05:14", "to figure out you know basically my", "05:15", "exact sort of physiology and they", "05:17", "created these bars based on all of the", "05:19", "research that they did that base were", "05:22", "these really high calorie bars because", "05:23", "there's the most high calories that I", "05:24", "needed to optimize space and they were", "05:27", "kind of they were all they're all", "05:28", "plant-based and ended up and then I know", "05:30", "there's what's in them again", "05:31", "you know coconut oil nuts seeds you know", "05:34", "sort of different phytonutrients in a", "05:37", "particular macronutrient blend that I", "05:38", "needed it was about 45% fat because I", "05:40", "needed the high fat about 40% protein", "05:43", "and then 15 math on that 15% Karp's and", "05:49", "so excuse me sorry I alternated the", "05:51", "protein carb quotient there but but yeah", "05:54", "it worked really well for that and so", "05:55", "when I was doing the row I called up", "05:57", "standard process again they've been", "05:58", "amazing partner of mine they were like", "05:59", "we're like hey I'm doing this row those", "06:01", "bars work so a good last time I'm like I", "06:03", "just said with you know trying to boil", "06:04", "water and you know all this stuff is", "06:05", "really challenging on the rowboat the", "06:07", "best would be to have this really kind", "06:08", "of high optimized nutrition that we", "06:09", "could use again for the project like", "06:11", "this but the parameters are different", "06:13", "you know the humidity is different the", "06:15", "temperature is different there's six of", "06:16", "us now there's not just one of me you", "06:18", "know can we optimize it for that so they", "06:19", "kind of made a specialty blend of the", "06:22", "bars again", "06:22", "but they've called the column bars like", "06:24", "probably come up with a better name but", "06:28", "they're not for sale we talked about", "06:30", "doing that so maybe in the future but", "06:32", "you can you can see online on their", "06:34", "website like all the different", "06:35", "supplements and stuff that went into it", "06:36", "so you can kind of buy the component", "06:37", "parts but yeah one day we might wait", "06:39", "but they've been kind of just custom for", "06:41", "these two projects they worked really", "06:42", "really well particularly in the rowing", "06:44", "so I mean they worked amazing in the", "06:45", "Antarctic crossing as well but in the", "06:47", "rowing it was 90 minutes of rowing on 90", "06:49", "minutes of rowing off continuous 24", "06:51", "hours a day so there's we're kind of in", "06:53", "two sets of three six of us total three", "06:55", "people rowing three people resting and", "06:57", "in that 90 minutes that you're off", "06:58", "that's also when you got a you know eat", "07:00", "drink sleep it's our only time to rest", "07:02", "basically and so as much time as you can", "07:04", "kind of optimize eating and stuff meant", "07:07", "more sleeping and so to have these bars", "07:08", "get done with a 90-minute rowing shift", "07:10", "be able to eat you know a thousand", "07:11", "calorie bar highest you know quality", "07:13", "nutrition in your body", "07:15", "I mean standard process nailed it again", "07:17", "it was amazing to you know have these", "07:18", "bars and have it work really well for", "07:20", "all of us to kind of optimize not just", "07:22", "the food but also the efficiency of", "07:23", "sleep because the sleep got crazy out", "07:25", "there like you can imagine yeah", "07:27", "so you're basically sleeping every 90", "07:30", "minutes for one hour or so yeah exactly", "07:34", "ish like if you can get it and like when", "07:36", "once the swells start cranking up but", "07:38", "you're in this tiny compartment like I", "07:39", "don't forget pulp a picture of the boat", "07:40", "for a visual or some of my Instagram not", "07:44", "covered like really not covered at all", "07:45", "like so well there's covered in the tiny", "07:47", "compartment so the rowing parts not", "07:49", "covered at all so when you're rowing", "07:50", "waves are splashing up like over top of", "07:52", "you I mean you're getting completely", "07:54", "soaked like you're getting you know", "07:55", "complete suck the entire time in the", "07:56", "entire compartment you know it's like", "07:58", "it's like lower than this table like", "08:00", "you'd be like kind of crouched down like", "08:01", "in there yeah this is the rowboat right", "08:05", "here so that's us so that's the floor is", "08:08", "that where all the food is stored", "08:10", "underneath yeah underneath there's", "08:11", "compartments you can see that tiny", "08:12", "little kind of compartment on either", "08:13", "side one smaller ones bigger than that's", "08:15", "where you guys would sleep that's what", "08:17", "we'd sleep well the bigger one has a", "08:18", "wave just like to believe that there's", "08:19", "12 feet three no six people", "08:22", "excuse one six people yeah but still see", "08:25", "you got you know three people in the", "08:27", "three people rowing and three people in", "08:28", "that compartment singing in town I think", "08:30", "if you kind of scroll up to the top", "08:31", "maybe there's one of just it shows like", "08:32", "the whole boat or like what it looks", "08:34", "like maybe there there's a kind of a", "08:36", "shot of it so yeah so you can see in", "08:38", "there like the back little compartment", "08:40", "that's where I was and I was alternating", "08:42", "with this guy fian who I mentioned the", "08:44", "Icelandic guy who was the captain the", "08:45", "boat and really experienced ocean rower", "08:47", "and we alternated inside this little", "08:50", "cabin and then the other four guys they", "08:51", "alternated two people because that one's", "08:53", "a", "08:53", "little bit bigger in the front that's", "08:54", "the bow cabin in the front but they're", "08:56", "like you're like head to toe in there or", "08:58", "you're crouched into a little ball it's", "08:59", "not it's not glamorous at all did you", "09:01", "know these guys are all before you did", "09:02", "this so not really", "09:05", "not really yeah it was a deep dive in", "09:07", "the team and after doing something solo", "09:09", "I was pretty excited to do something you", "09:10", "know as a team and doing something in a", "09:12", "completely you know exploring a", "09:13", "completely different kind of avenue of", "09:15", "exploration in the ocean something I had", "09:17", "never done before and I had actually not", "09:18", "only do I not know these guys a couple", "09:20", "of moments at college with but we like", "09:22", "really loosely knew each other like I", "09:23", "kind of like maybe like I recognized", "09:25", "their face a little bit but it didn't we", "09:26", "weren't like good friends living like", "09:27", "that three of them I'd never met my", "09:28", "entire life and I had also have never", "09:32", "rode a boat in my life ever before and", "09:35", "so when fian he called me up and told me", "09:39", "about the project he's one of the most", "09:40", "world's most renowned ocean rowers he's", "09:42", "got you know 30 world records or", "09:44", "something like that", "09:44", "complete legend he's rode boats across", "09:46", "every single ocean this was like the", "09:48", "kind of the last you know big ocean that", "09:50", "he'd never crossed no one you know no", "09:52", "one ever done it just like this before", "09:53", "and so he kind of said hey I wanted this", "09:56", "idea but the logistics are super", "09:58", "complicated like going Antarctica is all", "10:00", "this sort of like treaties that you need", "10:01", "all his paperwork getting a boat down to", "10:04", "South America importing it through the", "10:05", "Panama Canal extent I mean it's like a", "10:07", "tough thing and he'd been like kind of", "10:08", "thinking about it for a year or so and", "10:10", "he said like hey I've seen you pull off", "10:12", "some big projects together can we kind", "10:13", "of team up and I know you know your team", "10:15", "has got really good at figuring out", "10:16", "these logistics would you be interested", "10:17", "and I'd actually looked at ocean rowing", "10:19", "a couple years ago was something that I", "10:21", "was wanted to do one day and so it's", "10:23", "kind of a after I kind of got that first", "10:24", "phone call like I said like I'm like", "10:25", "dude I just got back from anarchic I", "10:27", "don't want to go back to tomorrow but", "10:29", "you know of course the curiosity had", "10:31", "sided we got the best of me and I called", "10:33", "him back up and I said hey let's do this", "10:34", "what are you thinking and kind of dove", "10:36", "into it from there kind of my my team", "10:38", "kind of wrapped their arms around the", "10:39", "sort of like logistic and building out", "10:41", "the project and he was definitely the", "10:42", "visionary of something he dreamed up and", "10:45", "it was super cool to team up with him", "10:46", "after doing something alone now this", "10:49", "thing that you did when you walked", "10:51", "across Antarctica", "10:53", "very impressive incredible but I'm sure", "10:57", "you've seen the National Geographic", "10:58", "article gory about you and they said", "11:01", "that there was another man from was it", "11:03", "Norway that had done it already", "11:06", "yes wasn't the first time someone had", "11:08", "gone across America yeah he had gone", "11:10", "actually a further distance yeah so", "11:13", "something I've been talking about super", "11:15", "openly including in my book which is a", "11:17", "Nazi article you know it's a little bit", "11:20", "unfortunate I actually just published a", "11:22", "16 page letter asking NatGeo to retract", "11:26", "the entire article", "11:27", "the reason 16 pages is unfortunately the", "11:29", "entire article they wrote is just so", "11:31", "riddled with inaccuracies and kind of", "11:33", "misrepresentations and omissions that", "11:36", "you know we had to kind of ask them say", "11:37", "hey look you know he kind of got this", "11:39", "wrong I was never properly interviewed", "11:41", "for it but one of the things you're", "11:42", "talking

three people", "44:45", "rowing three people in the cabin sending", "44:47", "given time and the cabins are tiny when", "44:48", "you're even with the you know one person", "44:50", "in one side like I was - in the other", "44:51", "side like you're like smashed in there", "44:52", "like a sardine but then when you put the", "44:54", "sea anchor out no one's rowing anymore", "44:56", "and that you know open decking it's like", "44:58", "really dangerous to just be sitting out", "44:59", "there so we all try to get in the cabins", "45:01", "but like this Icelandic dude who's the", "45:03", "captain fian Paul I mean he's like", "45:05", "amazing ro you know six foot two broad", "45:07", "shoulders whatever all of a sudden the", "45:08", "two of us are jammed inside of like the", "45:11", "smallest little parts like two feet", "45:13", "around three feet wide by three feet", "45:14", "tall we're like spooning each other", "45:16", "we're wet we're cold we're in there for", "45:18", "26 hours that time like how did you guys", "45:21", "poop so if you look that's yeah that", "45:24", "this one shows kind of the wave the big", "45:26", "swell I'm the I'm the one in the back", "45:27", "there and I'm sitting right next to a", "45:31", "really fancy toilet a little something", "45:32", "called a five-gallon bucket the bucket", "45:37", "it's a yeah and then the fish can snack", "45:41", "on that but you know you obviously get", "45:43", "not only were we spooning under sea", "45:45", "anchor smashing these little things then", "45:46", "often times those are the other guys", "45:48", "near the compartment either three three", "45:50", "of them were inside the compartment at a", "45:51", "time and one would be sitting out and", "45:53", "taking shifts or they sometimes smashed", "45:55", "four in there but I mean they're", "45:57", "literally on top of each other so we got", "45:59", "close but then also obviously there's no", "46:00", "space on the deck so it's like hey man", "46:02", "just turn your head away I'm gonna be", "46:03", "you know pooping of basically a foot", "46:05", "away from you while you row in this", "46:06", "bucket like don't mind me these mountain", "46:08", "houses will create some horrible smells", "46:10", "ladybug houses while hunting they're", "46:14", "rough especially for me cuz I don't eat", "46:16", "a lot of carbs yeah it's just yeah it's", "46:18", "all you know yeah though they do taste", "46:21", "good yeah they're in the middle the", "46:23", "ocean I bet they're delicious", "46:24", "I loved him yeah yeah they're really", "46:25", "good that that in the bars I was happy", "46:27", "with what the eating was good but when", "46:29", "you're halfway out there was any point", "46:30", "time where you're like what the fuck is", "46:32", "wrong with me", "46:33", "why am i doing this yes 100% so one of", "46:37", "the things like you know people have", "46:39", "asked me was you know solar Antarctica", "46:40", "crossing harder in the row whatever and", "46:42", "it's like they're very different but one", "46:43", "of the things that was so rude about", "46:44", "this Antarctica and the crossing was was", "46:46", "a lot colder than the Drake Passage row", "46:49", "it was about average temperature when we", "46:50", "were out there was probably like in low", "46:52", "30s you know dipped below a few times", "46:54", "but the ocean temperature like I said 30", "46:57", "to 33 you know just above freezing", "46:59", "there's icebergs in the water and we're", "47:01", "getting close to it and you're just", "47:02", "getting splashed the entire time so from", "47:04", "like minute one hour one leaving Cape", "47:06", "Horn we are soaking wet and what kind of", "47:10", "equipment are you wearing what kind of", "47:12", "gear are you wearing that keeps you from", "47:13", "so really cold so we we started out in", "47:17", "just this cortex as as thick like saline", "47:20", "gore-tex basically and that worked", "47:21", "pretty well for the first few days but", "47:23", "one of the other cool innovations that", "47:26", "feel and thought of having done so much", "47:27", "ocean rowing is he was like dude the", "47:29", "only way this is going to work is if we", "47:31", "have some sort of dry suit it's just too", "47:33", "cold but you start looking at dry suits", "47:35", "and you're like you could never row you", "47:37", "couldn't be functional like wearing like", "47:38", "this like crazy tri suit right and so he", "47:41", "basically says he spends the year one of", "47:44", "the things that he did is he found this", "47:45", "like polish manufacturer and we all got", "47:48", "our bodies measured no 20s five six", "47:50", "different measurements and all this and", "47:51", "basically created these custom dry suits", "47:53", "that were a lot thinner than a typical", "47:55", "dry suit but kept us dry but also", "47:57", "allowed us to have the mobility on the", "47:58", "oars and it was really actually built", "48:00", "for the sitting position in the leg you", "48:02", "know the leg press and the arm motion", "48:03", "and all that of rowing so it was awesome", "48:06", "innovation and we got just I mean thank", "48:09", "God we had those because we were getting", "48:10", "soaked I mean we were getting so so so", "48:13", "soaked out there and in the 90 minutes", "48:15", "you would think like oh in the 90", "48:16", "minutes quote-unquote rest phase you", "48:18", "would get in there you know maybe change", "48:20", "clothes something like that no", "48:21", "absolutely not like the we had these", "48:23", "suits on we're soaking wet we'd get in", "48:25", "the cabin we were all sharing like one", "48:27", "sleeping bag like I had just one", "48:28", "sleeping bag that Fiona and I were", "48:29", "alternating it's soaking wet after the", "48:31", "first day there's just like it's", "48:33", "basically like if I showed you what it", "48:34", "looked like a last day you'd be like I", "48:35", "wouldn't sit in there for one minute let", "48:37", "alone like try to sleep there's like no", "48:39", "pillars like what like the brown water", "48:40", "on the bottom like inter just like you", "48:43", "know it's the smells from us living in", "48:45", "and out of there", "48:45", "for this I mean it was grimy and wet and", "48:48", "cold but these suits Sooners pretty well", "48:50", "the one thing that was great you know", "48:52", "obviously we were clipped in for safety", "48:54", "so we were clipped into basically these", "48:56", "ropes that you saw on the edge of there", "48:57", "so if you're gonna get knocked off the", "48:58", "boat hopefully we would you know be able", "49:00", "to clipped in or the boat itself", "49:01", "actually fully self right so if it rolls", "49:03", "over it hypothetically rolls back over", "49:05", "the top we had some close calls but we", "49:07", "never fully rolled it and I thank God", "49:09", "but we did test that but one of the", "49:12", "things about the suits is the suits", "49:13", "basically have like neoprene booties", "49:15", "it's all like one kind of one-piece like", "49:17", "you would have in a dry suit which was", "49:19", "awesome for keeping us you know safe and", "49:21", "dry but I didn't take the suit off for", "49:24", "the last six or seven days at all and so", "49:27", "when I finally took the suit off my feet", "49:29", "like you think about your fingers", "49:31", "getting like pruney maybe like you know", "49:33", "in a swimming pool for a couple hours or", "49:34", "hot tub or something like that like", "49:35", "imagine seven days of wet and cold and", "49:38", "sweat and like all the things like when", "49:41", "I took the suit off like I almost", "49:43", "through cuts it was just like gnarly", "49:46", "festering skin and like like skin was", "49:49", "ripping off of my feet like it was nasty", "49:52", "how long until you recover from that um", "49:54", "I don't know exactly know it's hard to", "49:56", "put the point on like oh I'm recovered", "49:58", "but definitely took a few weeks to just", "49:59", "kind of get everything back you know", "50:01", "that's the stability back in all of that", "50:04", "so yeah yeah it was uh it was", "50:07", "interesting for sure what are you gonna", "50:09", "do next", "50:10", "cuz I know you you're one of those dudes", "50:13", "you have to keep doing these things", "50:14", "once you've done two of these things", "50:16", "you're gonna keep doing these things", "50:17", "yeah I did a couple before that too but", "50:20", "I think last time your advice to me was", "50:23", "stop stop oh yeah but you didn't listen", "50:31", "you know look like I'm passionate about", "50:34", "these things it's is super fun I do them", "50:37", "because I like testing the edges of my", "50:39", "potential I like exploring different", "50:41", "places like I'd never like I said I'd", "50:42", "never rode a boat before and that kind", "50:44", "of take this project on and say you know", "50:47", "I've done expeditions before I've pushed", "50:49", "my body and you know deep in interesting", "50:50", "ways but one of my biggest curiosities", "50:52", "is certainly about the mind but you know", "50:55", "particularly like growth mindset can I", "50:56", "say like I'm not a rower", "50:58", "in the course of a year of training I'm", "51:00", "gonna train myself up get on a team with", "51:02", "some amazingly you know accomplished", "51:04", "water men and learn the skills required", "51:06", "to you know make this crossing and it", "51:08", "was cool to kind of prove that out this", "51:09", "year because I think that that really", "51:12", "applies across so many things and I'm", "51:14", "just a generally curious person and I", "51:17", "think I'll keep pushing myself and", "51:18", "pushing my body because that's one of", "51:19", "the things that I love to do but I think", "51:21", "that curiosity throughout my life is", "51:23", "going to be you know a lifelong path of", "51:25", "diving into sort of different things and", "51:27", "taking them on I think that to me one of", "51:30", "my biggest sadness is one of the things", "51:31", "I like to say to people was like you", "51:33", "know people come to a certain point in", "51:34", "that their life and they're like you", "51:36", "know I'm I'm a lawyer or I'm good at", "51:38", "math or I'm terrible at art or like I", "51:41", "could never do comedy because I'm not", "51:42", "the funny one or I'm like you know these", "51:43", "limiting beliefs inside of us it's like", "51:45", "I could be like dude I've never wrote", "51:47", "ever in my life I'm you know 34 years", "51:49", "old you know I've never wrote a book but", "51:51", "actually like but like doesn't mean I", "51:52", "can't learn now to row a boat that's", "51:54", "pretty straightforward yeah exactly how", "51:57", "hard could it be you know a little leg", "51:59", "action - what did you do to prepare for", "52:01", "physically so the physical the physical", "52:05", "prep was was pretty cool I don't know if", "52:08", "you remember from last time but I've", "52:10", "just coached his name's Mike McCaskill", "52:11", "and he's just this legendary guy he's uh", "52:14", "you know done 5,800 pull-ups in 24 hours", "52:17", "he's pulled a truck across Death Valley", "52:20", "oh yeah he's a total total legend and he", "52:23", "trained me up from America I mean I came", "52:25", "to him and I said hey look like I'm not", "52:26", "the most experienced polar explorer I", "52:28", "gotta pull this 375 pounds sled like", "52:30", "what do you think how can you train me", "52:31", "up and he came up with such cool", "52:33", "training methodologies for that like he", "52:36", "had one of the things he had me doing", "52:37", "for Antarctica was he had me you know I", "52:39", "was doing planks of my hands in ice", "52:41", "buckets and you know as my heart rates", "52:43", "getting jacked up he's having me hold", "52:44", "that and all of a sudden he's like", "52:45", "alright get out and I do in a wall sit", "52:47", "but now my feet are in the ice buckets", "52:49", "and he puts a weight plate on top of my", "52:51", "legs and he's like okay and then he", "52:53", "hands me these Legos and he's like", "52:55", "solved these Lego problems and until you", "52:57", "don't solve this Lego and build this", "52:58", "little like you know aircraft little", "52:59", "Lego man or whatever you know you can't", "53:01", "get your feet out of the ice bucket like", "53:02", "what the hell was going on but he's like", "53:04", "look you're gonna be in Antarctica your", "53:06", "life is going to depend on Utah you know", "53:08", "securing your tent right or", "53:09", "tying down the ropes properly or this", "53:11", "and that the other thing you're going to", "53:12", "be cold your hands are gonna be frozen", "53:14", "you're gonna be tired but you're gonna", "53:15", "need your mind your dexterity to be", "53:17", "there yeah there's the there's a picture", "53:18", "of that of Mike bringing me through that", "53:21", "and so with the row it was super cool to", "53:25", "come to him again and say like hey man", "53:27", "like there's no blueprint for this like", "53:28", "there's no blueprint for this there's no", "53:30", "one that's done a fully human power", "53:32", "crossing of Drake Passage before to the", "53:34", "Antarctic Peninsula like there's some", "53:36", "ocean rowers but this is different like", "53:38", "how should we prepare for this and Mike", "53:40", "it's not like he's like well I know", "53:41", "everything about ocean rowing but that", "53:42", "same curiosity that same growth mindset", "53:45", "I trust his you know sort of ability to", "53:46", "train he's like I don't know man like", "53:48", "let's start thinking through this and so", "53:50", "in the gym I mean we did all sorts of", "53:52", "creative things he brought the ice back", "53:53", "he started putting a rowing machine on", "53:55", "BOSU balls like half BOSU balls", "53:58", "basically and I'd start rowing you know", "54:00", "didn't nor him a rowing motion but he'd", "54:02", "starts shaking it around because", "54:03", "basically the ocean is gonna be moving", "54:04", "me around so much so just the rowing", "54:06", "motion isn't gonna prepare me for the", "54:07", "lateral movements you know the the lats", "54:10", "the obliques you know the all the kind", "54:11", "of side-to-side stability stuff then he", "54:13", "took it one step further which is he", "54:15", "actually shows up at my house knocks on", "54:17", "my door at two o'clock in the morning I", "54:19", "think he had pre-arranged it with my", "54:20", "wife knocks on the door he's like get up", "54:22", "and I'm like what that's happening and", "54:24", "he's like we're going we're training", "54:25", "right now and he gets me he's got those", "54:27", "BOSU balls but now it's the middle of", "54:29", "the night so I'm sleep-deprived I'm kind", "54:31", "of disoriented now he's got me on the", "54:33", "BOSU balls and he had brought these", "54:35", "buckets of ice water so I'm rowing this", "54:37", "thing it's shaking around it's the", "54:38", "middle of night and he starts throwing", "54:39", "ice water on me and we're doing these", "54:41", "laps yeah Here I am", "54:42", "you know getting into this the yeah you", "54:45", "could check these out the Discovery", "54:46", "Channel did back this is training for", "54:48", "the Drake the impossible row episode 3", "54:51", "you could find it online Jamie's on the", "54:53", "Discovery Channel YouTube page YouTube", "54:55", "they have a whole playlist", "54:57", "ok yeah so there's 14 of these videos", "54:59", "training all the way through the whole", "55:00", "project discovery put them online", "55:01", "they're actually doing a feature-length", "55:02", "documentary this spring but yeah did you", "55:04", "do for rowing for the specific muscles", "55:06", "of rowing yourself did you lift weights", "55:08", "did you do rows did use a rowing machine", "55:10", "which use yeah so the rowing machine on", "55:13", "the BOSU balls that's like in the gym", "55:14", "also a lot of deadlift was really useful", "55:18", "and then a lot of stability stuff so", "55:20", "Mike would have me do certain things", "55:21", "like we'd have you", "55:22", "like a seated row or something like that", "55:24", "or more thongs I thought that was the", "55:25", "most interesting because it was going to", "55:26", "be disabled so the waves are usually", "55:28", "coming from and they change directions", "55:30", "but any given time they're coming", "55:31", "generally from one direction so you're", "55:33", "there leaning and really hard to your", "55:34", "left side you're leaning and really hard", "55:35", "to your right side that's a different to", "55:36", "the ocean rowing than just like a pure", "55:38", "river rowing and you know he would have", "55:40", "me basically like holding imagine like a", "55:44", "like a like a deadlift bar mm-hm and", "55:48", "then I'd have my eyes closed I'd be", "55:50", "holding it there and kind of an", "55:51", "isometric motion and then he would pull", "55:53", "the plate a light plate off one of the", "55:55", "sides and so I'd have to stabilize and", "55:57", "catch you know even my left side on my", "55:59", "right side so a lot of stabilization and", "56:01", "balance stuff and then the other piece", "56:03", "that was huge you know Mike you know", "56:04", "admittedly doesn't know a lot about", "56:05", "rowing specifically in terms of the", "56:07", "technique of rowing and the technique of", "56:09", "rowing is actually very specific and so", "56:10", "a friend of mine a guy named Chris wada", "56:13", "from Portland he I called him up and", "56:16", "he's like this champion rower collegiate", "56:18", "rower on rowing coach and he took me out", "56:20", "on the Willamette River in Portland in a", "56:22", "single man like rowing scull so very", "56:24", "different than an ocean Robo ocean", "56:26", "robots a lot bigger different different", "56:27", "waves but he taught me on the river the", "56:29", "actual purity of the rowing motion so a", "56:32", "lot of the training and the physical", "56:33", "aspects I'm getting stronger was with", "56:35", "Mike and the mindset and the ice and all", "56:37", "the things we did there but certainly", "56:39", "the stuff that we did on the route on", "56:41", "the river in in the Willamette with", "56:44", "Chris was huge for me to actually", "56:45", "understand the motion because I just", "56:47", "like you and you're like how hard could", "56:49", "it be just kind of push your arms you", "56:50", "know back and forth of it's a pretty", "56:52", "complicated motion it's a full body", "56:54", "thing it's a coordinate it's a very", "56:55", "coordinated thing you know you're", "56:57", "powering out of different things and", "56:58", "certainly on river rowing you're having", "57:00", "to you know squares called squaring the", "57:03", "blades and you know if you're taking the", "57:06", "blades out of the water and you know", "57:07", "turning them so they could slide across", "57:08", "the top and get back in and glide and", "57:10", "all that kind of stuff so there's a lot", "57:12", "there's a lot to the motion and so it", "57:13", "was a short period of time I didn't take", "57:15", "my first stroke in a rowboat until July", "57:18", "and in the in the in the river and then", "57:20", "August in the ocean robot when we came", "57:22", "together as a team for the first time to", "57:24", "Train in Scotland and then I was rowing", "57:25", "across the Drake in December so it was a", "57:27", "pretty short period of time to kind of", "57:29", "learn learn about rowing and get", "57:30", "stronger but it was a fun process to", "57:32", "dive into something completely new", "57:34", "so all from August September October", "57:36", "November into December digit rain and", "57:38", "row all the time um you know quite a lot", "57:41", "but there was other things going I was", "57:43", "writing this I was writing a book I was", "57:44", "writing the book in the book at the same", "57:46", "time you know traveling doing different", "57:48", "things but yeah I mean obviously the", "57:49", "training was a core focus but it wasn't", "57:52", "like I was like everyday I was always", "57:54", "doing his rowing 10 hours a day or", "57:55", "something like that there was uh you", "57:57", "know other things going on I imagine you", "57:58", "would need some pretty spectacular", "58:00", "endurance to do that 90 minutes on the", "58:03", "hour every 90 minutes yeah so you got 90", "58:05", "minutes on 90 minutes off I know my", "58:08", "strategy for doing that we just did not", "58:11", "burn yourselves out too much but yeah so", "58:13", "like I said fian you know has you know a", "58:15", "lot of ocean rowing experience and from", "58:17", "his other expeditions we kind of", "58:18", "collectively talked about it as a team", "58:20", "and he was just like okay you know this", "58:22", "is what the Heath felt has worked the", "58:24", "best for people to you know do a long", "58:26", "stretch get enough rest but you know", "58:28", "obviously maybe the first day or two you", "58:30", "think oh I could row for four hours at a", "58:32", "time or something like that and you can", "58:33", "get longer stretch of rest but over time", "58:35", "make your body really starts to wear it", "58:37", "down and so he kind of you know felt", "58:39", "that was the happy balance and it", "58:41", "definitely I mean I was delirious we", "58:43", "were all delirious and sleep-deprived", "58:44", "and it got weird had the hair for sure", "58:46", "but I think it was the best my body", "58:47", "actually held up pretty well and I feel", "58:49", "like Chanel who is yeah it was the Ohio", "58:52", "like the things going on in my mind the", "58:55", "the night time like the night shift", "58:57", "was really crazy so at the night the", "58:59", "light nights weren't super long you got", "59:01", "about three hours of darkness every", "59:03", "single night but that meant at least one", "59:04", "90-minute shift was

that", "69:09", "learning and you know I've been asked a", "69:12", "question I guess before but my answer or", "69:15", "the way that I kind of think about it is", "69:17", "I've started to think
