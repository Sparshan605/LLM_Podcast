to that state or", "08:52", "no no I think", "08:53", "you have to learn how to not as reliable", "08:54", "as drugs and right and also physically", "08:57", "demanding like I think it takes a long", "08:59", "time I think you have to work yourself", "09:01", "up into this state where this stuff", "09:02", "starts to happen and you also have to", "09:04", "probably follow some routine that's", "09:07", "tried-and-true", "09:07", "all right I don't know what that routine", "09:09", "is but I do know that people that I", "09:11", "trust including people like Adams super", "09:14", "smart guys will tell you that for them", "09:17", "it gave them the same experience as like", "09:19", "taking a drug all right I'm gonna look", "09:21", "it up because I'm not big on drugs I", "09:22", "don't

people", "11:09", "is actually fact my doctor who's a", "11:11", "researcher as well she said that if you", "11:14", "look at longevity the people who have", "11:18", "the shorter life expectancies are the", "11:21", "people who drink a lot not a surprise", "11:23", "and none so it's the people who drink", "11:26", "from like one and a half to maybe two", "11:28", "and a half maybe a little bit more", "11:29", "drinks a day have the longest life", "11:31", "expectancy she doesn't know though", "11:33", "whether it's the teetotalers why do they", "11:36", "live long the shorter it may be because", "11:38", "they can't alleviate the stress maybe", "11:41", "you know it could be that alcohol does", "11:43", "have physiological benefits we don't", "11:44", "know but the message seems to be that", "11:46", "everybody should drink a little bit yeah", "11:48", "there's got to be a benefit in", "11:50", "relaxation there's got to be you know I", "11:53", "was listening to your podcast

you and a", "12:13", "good feeling is probably good for you", "12:15", "and the little trade-off health-wise", "12:16", "look I kind of feel like you can get", "12:18", "make that up in the gym and

want to have smiles", "12:27", "agree it relaxes you also you know this", "12:31", "is a phrase that younger people will not", "12:33", "remember but actually I can't remember", "12:35", "it either so um I think it's the social", "12:38", "lubricant it was a usable alcohol right", "12:39", "and so the fact is is that a lot of", "12:42", "people have a lot of trouble", "12:44", "communicating with other people", "12:45", "period whether it's loved ones you", "12:47", "either say you're too candid or you're", "12:50", "not candid enough with strangers so a", "12:53", "lot of people have a hard

could have played golf or", "13:29", "whatever but people have been walking", "13:31", "for a long time and they say that", "13:33", "there's something about what the brain", "13:34", "and body do in concert with each other", "13:38", "on a walk which is your kind of mapping", "13:39", "you're kind of decoding you're kind of", "13:41", "figuring but you're also getting some", "13:43", "fizzy lock physiological stimulation and", "13:45", "I find that's one that's pretty good but", "13:48", "I wish there was a thing I could do to", "13:50", "make the good ideas flow because that's", "13:52",

bad is actually extra", "42:22", "super painful like when you watch a", "42:24", "comedian bomb on stage and you're in the", "42:25", "audience you're funny like you're mad at", "42:28", "this person for putting you through this", "42:29", "like oh my gosh you can't be mad at him", "42:31", "don't you isn't it more empathy than", "42:33", "anger sure yeah but sure but you there's", "42:35", "a lot of anger to because who are you", "42:38", "are being tortured like imagine if it's", "42:40", "not really physical pain but there is a", "42:42", "certain level of emotional pain you", "42:44", "experience that someone's bombing", "42:46", "someone's in front of you like oh god", "42:48", "especially me because I've done stand-up", "42:50", "for so many years like I know what it's", "42:51",

I always wondered about comics", "42:59", "is why they don't cheat more because", "43:03", "laughter is plainly very contagious", "43:06", "right yeah so every time I've seen", "43:09", "someone bomb I always felt like if one", "43:12", "or two people had started going with it", "43:14", "laughing responding you mean cheap more", "43:17", "by packing the audience some people", "43:18", "laugh something or just putting your", "43:20", "iPhone in the audience and having it", "43:22", "start laughing I don't know how to", "43:23", "there's a lot of ways to cheat because", "43:25", "I've always thought that it's such a", "43:27", "it's such an obvious dynamic that", "43:30", "laughter real is very very contagious", "43:32", "but even like you see like kids in", "43:34", "school when they're supposed to not be", "43:35", "laughing in one kid laughs they they all", "43:37", "can't stop it's just incredibly", "43:39", "contagious behavior so I think if you", "43:41", "did pipe in laughter first of all I'm", "43:44", "not saying well maybe I am okay that's", "43:50", "most drastic let's say you plant people", "43:53", "in the audience right you could probably", "43:55", "swing things in a way from a really bad", "43:58", "set to maybe an okay set but you're", "44:00", "never gonna make it funny see all the", "44:03", "best way to do that is to just make it", "44:07", "actually they focus to bothered to be", "44:09", "good that's not that cheating things not", "44:11", "helping you ever it's like it's gonna", "44:13", "get in the way you make anything from it", "44:15", "it's like people that steal other", "44:17", "people's jokes they never learned how to", "44:19", "write you know they did they you have to", "44:21", "figure out the language of it and when", "44:23", "you're up there if you're just doing", "44:26", "fake laughs in the background to juice", "44:27", "it up you're not gonna know how to get", "44:29", "real ones yeah I'm gonna feel weird", "44:30", "about it oh you're gonna be also you're", "44:32", "gonna know that you're doing it the", "44:33", "audience is gonna know that something's", "44:34", "wrong you're gonna do Rea so maybe I'm", "44:37", "not talking about cheating per se as", "44:39", "sense as having as having some and I'm", "44:45", "sure every comic does this already so", "44:47", "it's not like I'm telling anybody", "44:48", "anything but having some something in", "44:52", "your pocket that's gonna get them on", "44:54", "your side even if for a little while", "44:57", "just to get the momentum going in your", "44:59", "way we certainly do have some bits that", "45:01", "you know work because like when you say", "45:03", "like if you bomb or somebody else bombs", "45:05", "you could give exactly the same set an", "45:08", "hour later to a slightly different crowd", "45:10", "and it would go great right so now times", "45:12", "sometimes you're bombing because you get", "45:15", "off on a bad start like you'll you'll", "45:17", "come up with it like the real sketchy", "45:19", "time is when you're writing new material", "45:21", "that's when that's touch and go the way", "45:23", "I always like to describe it's like you", "45:25", "have no weapons like you're going into a", "45:27", "fight but everything's made out of", "45:28", "rubber like fuck like nothing's good yet", "45:30", "right yeah like when you you have new", "45:32", "material you have a stack of notes and", "45:34", "about four or five premises and one or", "45:35", "two of them might be any good but I got", "45:37", "to go through those other premises that", "45:39", "suck multiple times to find out for sure", "45:41", "that they're no good all right let me", "45:43", "ask you a question when that's happening", "45:45", "to you do you learn over time to not let", "45:50", "it hurt your ego to the point where", "45:52", "you're gonna get even worse in other", "45:54", "words if you're not doing well what you", "45:56", "need to do is you need to say I've got", "45:59", "this material I need to work on it", "46:01", "because it's gonna get better but I", "46:03", "could imagine that if you start bombing", "46:04", "what happens is you just feel so hurt", "46:07", "that you get worse and worse as you go", "46:09", "how do you fight against that yeah it's", "46:11", "a psychological mind game for sure you", "46:14", "you definitely could look and I've seen", "46:16", "it happen to comedians while they're", "46:18", "writing a whole new", "46:18", "our it's almost like they lose their", "46:21", "glow as a human because they're just", "46:23", "eating shit all the time and we get away", "46:26", "from them like they're diseased like I'm", "46:28", "selling bombs they come offstage", "46:29", "you get away from them because we know", "46:32", "what it's like I don't want to feel", "46:34", "contagious a little bit yeah it's you", "46:37", "got to get out of the room

lot of", "73:49", "people are willing to enter it because", "73:51", "the the winning is so high but you know", "73:54", "that you're not going to make anything", "73:55", "unless you advance a whole

the most", "75:30", "popular make the most money the question", "75:32", "is should the guys the bottom make more", "75:34", "I think they should and I've always", "75:35", "thought that because I think it's a very", "75:37", "very very difficult thing and I think we", "75:39", "should be trying to give them enough", "75:41", "money so that they can do their best if", "75:43", "we can see the best fighters come up I", "75:44", "think one of the impediments of guys", "75:46", "coming up is that in the beginning you", "75:48", "have to work a full-time job as well as", "75:49", "fight it's really hard to train it's", "75:51", "hard to make that leap and if we get", "75:53", "someone we could sign it I agree with", "75:55", "you there should be some sort of a", "75:56", "minimum and that minimum would we would", "75:59", "agree upon something that would be", "76:01", "sustainable if you're fighting we'll say", "76:03", "once or twice a year on the other hand", "76:05", "with twice a year at least okay", "76:06", "especially the beginning you would fight", "76:07", "you'd probably fight as many times as", "76:08", "you can in the beginning you'd fight", "76:10", "three times a year if you could four", "76:11", "even and guys like Donald Cerrone even", "76:13", "at the top still fights like four or", "76:15", "five times a year just cuz he's a wild", "76:16", "man", "76:16",

"76:25", "audience demand but what UFC is doing is", "76:27", "according to you kind of smartly", "76:29", "constraining the supply so that the", "76:32", "quality is high yes if you were to come", "76:34", "in let's say you or ten other people", "76:36", "were to come in with alternate leagues", "76:38", "to UFC right now and take you know after", "76:41", "the UFC as whatever let's say there's a", "76:44", "hundred very good fighters right now", "76:46", "we're 50 I have no idea but let's say", "76:47", "you take the next 200 and make those", "76:49", "other leads are you saying that would", "76:51", "basically be what happened to boxing and", "76:53", "then do end up when we are doing that ya", "76:56", "know if you know but there's multiple", "76:58", "organizations that actually are doing", "76:59", "that there's one called Bellator that's", "77:01", "huge Don the paramount Network its", "77:03", "enormous and it's this the biggest rival", "77:05", "to the UFC in

shake they get they get a share and I", "77:29", "don't know how its structured but in the", "77:31", "butt I know that the fighters prefer the", "77:33", "Bellator model which is they can find",

those", "77:57", "down chase those sponsors down a lot of", "77:59", "them go bad on you and a lot of them", "78:00", "don't pay and there was a real problem", "78:02", "with that with fighters where you know", "78:04", "they would gotten fucked over by a", "78:05", "couple different sponsors and it created", "78:07", "a hassle and so so then you have", "78:09", "fighters who didn't get paid but the", "78:11", "sponsor did get put on UFC oh boy and", "78:14", "thank you so is the UFC responsible like", "78:16", "who's responsible for that and it turns", "78:19", "out it's the fighters that are", "78:20", "responsible but that's a fucking giant", "78:21", "burden on them whether in the middle of", "78:22", "training to try to go sue some you know", "78:25", "fight gear company that didn't pay them", "78:27", "their money I don't think it's a", "78:29", "justification for not giving them the", "78:31", "freedom to choose their own sponsors I", "78:33", "think a better scenario would probably", "78:35", "be have one sponsor available that you", "78:39", "you know like everyone couldn't choose", "78:41", "this sponsor or a competing sponsor you", "78:44", "know like maybe something else so like", "78:46", "you could have a Reebok guy that's", "78:47", "fighting against a guy who's like some", "78:49", "motor oil company yeah yeah bothering", "78:50", "them it's like

you've laid out some facts", "106:35", "and laid out some counterfactuals I", "106:37", "appreciate the opportunity to change my", "106:40", "mind I enjoy that I don't you well I", "106:43", "think we're so often married to our", "106:45", "ideas like our ideas are a part of us", "106:47", "and we're losing if our ideas that we've", "106:50", "been discussing or incorrect if our", "106:51",

bad spot", "107:09", "it's like a little spa yeah and the", "107:10", "back-up plan sucked everything's wrong", "107:12", "and now they have this nuclear hot spot", "107:14", "that they're you know it's gonna be like", "107:15", "that for a hundred thousand years right", "107:17", "there's a better way and they never had", "107:19", "a chance to find that better way right", "107:21", "because

clean right it's fucking", "107:35", "really clean it's really clean if it's", "107:38", "done right and if they allowed them to", "107:39", "innovate over those 40 years we would", "107:41", "have got to someplace where it's like", "107:42", "super efficient just like everything", "107:44", "else if you look at a 1970 car yeah", "107:47", "right and then you look at a car from", "107:48", "2020
