"challenge I it was I would have been", "04:38", "shooting an animal not it the adventure", "04:41", "wasn't there the challenge wasn't there", "04:42", "it just wasn't the right time I wanted", "04:45", "to keep going hmm", "04:47", "until it and so it happened I don't know", "04:49", "it's a weird but for me hunting is about", "04:51", "the adventure and everything behind it", "04:53", "and so as well as obviously getting meat", "04:56", "but there comes a point where you know", "04:58", "if okay if I didn't get a deer this week", "05:00", "well maybe I'll get one next week I'm",

other", "05:13", "things as well the experience the", "05:15", "adventure the meat all combining into", "05:19", "this if it's too easy I just don't like", "05:22", "it", "05:22", "that's fat I don't know it okay it'll", "05:24", "happen you know for me it happened I", "05:26", "started I would when I was younger I", "05:29", "never wanted to stop hunting because I", "05:31", "liked the experience of being out there", "05:33", "so much so I would do it a lot of people", "05:36", "called trophy hunting and I'm here", "05:37", "quoting that because it means something", "05:39", "different to me where I would look for a", "05:41", "bigger deer because I wanted to keep", "05:45", "hunting and make it more of a challenge", "05:46", "for myself I find it quite remarkable", "05:50", "that people worry about this simply", "05:52", "because it's not the way that people", "05:55", "actually think about anything else let's", "05:59", "remember that the longevity aspect of", "06:02", "all of this work is a side effect I", "06:04", "don't work on longevity I don't I", "06:07", "certainly don't work on immortality the", "06:09", "way you might think if you read the", "06:11", "papers I just work on health I'm just", "06:14", "interested in stopping people from", "06:16", "getting sick when they get older now if", "06:20", "you think about it all medicine is like", "06:21", "that all medicine involves stopping", "06:24", "people from getting sick or fixing them", "06:26", "other thing I think", "06:27", "and all medicine has a side effect that", "06:29", "people live longer than they otherwise", "06:30", "would have done so the only real", "06:32", "difference between the work that sense", "06:34", "Research Foundation does and the work", "06:36", "that everything everyone else in medical", "06:38", "research does is a difference of degree", "06:40", "the fact that the longevity side effect", "06:45", "of our work may be substantially greater", "06:46", "than the longevity side effect that", "06:48", "we're familiar with it's still a side", "06:50", "effect so if we come to the question of", "06:52", "how one might want to live you know does", "06:56", "that any it's not even a meaningful", "06:57", "question to me it's like saying what", "07:00", "time would you like to go to the toilet", "07:02", "next Sunday you know we know that that's", "07:05", "a dumb thing to
