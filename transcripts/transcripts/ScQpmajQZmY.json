flower cannabis and they picked", "54:47", "varieties that yielded the most amount", "54:49", "of pot because it was the reason being", "54:51", "is that the ones that were equatorial", "54:54", "the ones that we're growing on the", "54:55", "equator needed a longer cycle of Sun", "54:58", "because it's right because they're in a", "55:00", "12 12 and those are the ones that have", "55:02", "the
