for a power outlet for these", "29:50", "things so why didn't we invent this", "29:54", "without the twenty billion dollar space", "29:55", "right you didn't you weren't you didn't", "29:59", "think about it you said oh I can plug it", "30:01", "in this is great you're not even", "30:02", "thinking what you need so yes there are", "30:05", "all of these applications but but I", "30:08", "don't that's a good reason to do it but", "30:11", "I don't think it's the best way the best", "30:12", "reasons are my gosh don't you want to", "30:14", "keep dreaming don't you want to keep", "30:16",

super", "30:23", "pragmatic and they go why do we need to", "30:25", "go to Mars now what we need to do is", "30:27", "take care of this and pay for that and", "30:29", "we were the deficit and the budget and", "30:32", "you know so you know NASA's budget today", "30:35", "is four tenths of one percent of the", "30:40", "federal budget so", "30:42", "you take a dollar or a tense one I will", "30:44", "quantify everybody take a dollar bill", "30:46", "and imagine that's your tax dollar and", "30:50", "you can like cut it to whatever percent", "30:53", "you want so let's cut four tenths of one", "30:55", "percent off of the edge that doesn't get", "30:58", "you into the ink you're still in the", "31:00", "border around it all right even notice", "31:03", "that you would even though you could", "31:04", "trim that off the dollar and pay for", "31:06", "anything pay for it so my point is most", "31:09", "of the people who say don't spend it", "31:11", "here spend it there they think NASA has", "31:15", "more budget than it actually does they", "31:18", "just they there if you ask them how much", "31:20", "they think any oh ten percent five", "31:22", "percent you know several percent no it's", "31:24", "one-half of one percent so if you're", "31:26", "gonna tell me that if you can take that", "31:29", "four tenths of one percent and spend it", "31:32", "in these other problems and solve them I", "31:34", "would say yeah go right ahead but is", "31:37", "this is this where you really want to", "31:39", "pull the money from when it's the only", "31:41", "thing that

out", "69:14", "from it and then you get the vanishing", "69:17", "point on it so yeah all those are zoom", "69:20", "zoomed in let's go to yeah that one", "69:23", "looks more like like my photo I go back", "69:25", "to that other one yeah see so so that's", "69:29", "on 34th Street the one you see now and", "69:31", "then you get this sparkling effect that", "69:33", "happens twice a year twice

no", "70:14", "there's another one but go back to all", "70:18", "of these rivers Wow zoom back out it's", "70:20", "you see all the pictures there you go to", "70:23", "the bottom left there you go okay that", "70:24", "might be the first ever Manhattanhenge", "70:27", "photo what is that from I took that in", "70:31", "2001 right - and it got published in", "70:33", "2002 before September 11th this is July", "70:36", "I took it before September 11th right", "70:38", "right and then I had a means to publish", "70:40", "it and right then the notice that it's a", "70:45", "green light and traffic is ready to", "70:47", "knock me over so so no one is in the", "70:50", "streets doing this but now there are", "70:51", "tens of thousands of people that pour", "70:52", "into the streets on these days we post", "70:55", "what day you're getting Manhattanhenge", "70:56", "from the American Museum of Natural", "70:58", "History my day job and then that goes", "71:00", "out the press gets it and tens of", "71:03", "thousands of people spin with the street", "71:04", "blocking traffic and if you think of all", "71:06", "the ways traffic gets blocked in your", "71:08", "day yeah it was too many of them by", "71:14", "yourself it's interesting it's great", "71:15", "yeah so that's what it'll become holding", "71:17", "up phones but it's all because I went to", "71:20", "Stonehenge yeah so it's a it's also a", "71:22", "observatory so this was it you that", "71:24", "named this yeah yeah damn check you out", "71:27", "coins coins I think say coined it yeah", "71:29", "Manhattan hinge because the buildings", "71:32", "are like hinges the hinge is a stone is", "71:34", "a vertical stone there's a vertical", "71:36", "structure if you made a stone it's a", "71:37", "stone hinge why isn't it possible to", "71:40", "construct a calendar that doesn't have", "71:42", "leap years what you would have to do you", "71:45", "could do it but what would happen is it", "71:48", "means you care more about the year than", "71:49", "you do about the day so what would", "71:52", "happen is you would celebrate the New", "71:54", "Year at like 3:00 in the afternoon", "71:58", "right and then the next year you've", "72:00", "celebrated at like 12 minutes after 3:00", "72:03", "in the afternoon and then 20 minutes you", "72:06", "would you would it would sort of move", "72:07", "through your calendar and then that", "72:10", "means you cared more about the year the", "72:14", "Atari you care more about the til I say", "72:17", "that right you we always want to", "72:20", "celebrate New Year's on midnight of the", "72:21", "and by the way New Year's is celebrated", "72:24", "in 24 time zones not all at the same", "72:26", "time right", "72:27", "so it's interesting everyone thinks of", "72:28", "that as a moment hmm yeah it's really a", "72:31", "calendar event I'm sorry it's a cock", "72:34", "event it's celebrated over 24 hours yeah", "72:36", "if you're in Thailand it's 14 hours", "72:38", "different so therefore if you were to do", "72:40", "it astrophysically you would know the", "72:42", "exact moment where we returned in our", "72:44", "orbit and everybody would celebrate that", "72:47", "instant mmm and that would be so then", "72:50", "the whole world would celebrate the New", "72:51", "Year at the same time that it means you", "72:54", "value it differently it's not a midnight", "72:55", "celebration it's a you could do that I", "72:58", "know less Jill so it's a celestial", "73:00", "yeah huh so that would be the only way", "73:03", "yeah that's the only way because a day", "73:05", "doesn't cut evenly into the year that", "73:08", "those two have nothing to do with one", "73:09", "another", "73:10", "there's no reason why that would have so", "73:12", "we we we so in other words let me say it", "73:16", "another way just because you're looking", "73:17", "like you're like you're looking off in", "73:19", "space here so there's New Year's okay", "73:24", "let's count 365 days when we do that we", "73:29", "are not at the same place we were when", "73:34", "we last celebrated New Year's Day New", "73:36", "Year's Eve okay we're not the same place", "73:38", "in orbit a revolution around you rotate", "73:42", "on an axis you revolve around something", "73:44", "else as those two words okay how you use", "73:45", "those two words so we're not in the same", "73:47", "place but we celebrate New Year's anyway", "73:49", "well when will we be in the same place a", "73:52", "quarter of a day later six

you", "77:42", "want to be the first to report it mm and", "77:43", "then that gets emblazoned in people's", "77:45", "heads and not everyone reads the", "77:46", "follow-up no one could duplicate

yeah that's the issue sticks when", "80:24", "it gets moisture you know about this we", "80:27", "flip this over and you tip it over and", "80:29", "then it whatever done that you know what", "80:33",

are", "80:50", "convinced the world is a ball the world", "80:53", "is a circle that lures us what is this", "80:56", "fear oyd so what it's called oblique I", "80:58", "mean I'd like to see how that question", "80:59", "exactly because if they know that we are", "81:02", "oblate and the thing is asking is earth", "81:04", "a ball they'll say no we're in a blatant", "81:06", "ball I'm slightly

I'm not a mountain climber but", "82:48", "I'm I'm just thinking where's k1 okay", "82:50", "with it's the Himalayan mountains okay", "82:52", "in Nepal okay isn't it in Nepal I think", "82:55", "it is yeah yeah okay so now let's say", "82:59", "how high up is that was 28,000 feet so", "83:02", "it's like five miles up okay right the", "83:06", "distance between the lowest point on", "83:10",

are 8,000 miles in diameter and", "83:26", "those two points are very far separated", "83:29", "from one another if you are cosmic giant", "83:32", "and you came up to earth and you rubbed", "83:34",

problem with", "84:24", "YouTube videos is it's a problem with a", "84:28", "lot of things but one of the things", "84:29", "about being unchecked while you're", "84:31", "discussing things is you can say things", "84:34", "you can use big words you can sound", "84:36", "articulate and smooth and you can do it", "84:38", "in a very professional-looking manner or", "84:41", "do it passionately yes

go stop that's", "84:55", "not true stop that's not what works", "84:57", "right let me show you why this is", "84:58", "incorrect let me show you how you can", "85:00", "prove the", "85:00", "this is incorrect show your objective", "85:02", "truths but this is not happy to render", "85:04", "your argument invalid so people don't", "85:06", "have any education and then they watch", "85:08", "one of these YouTube clips they start", "85:10", "actually believing that this stuff makes", "85:11", "sense because it's unchecked and I would", "85:13", "say it's not about whether they've had", "85:14",

"evidence to back it and the other does", "85:51", "not", "85:51", "and very strong scientific theoretical", "85:55", "and experimental underpinnings so when", "85:58", "you are trained to inquire you don't", "86:01", "either believe everything outright or", "86:03", "reject everything outright you're", "86:04", "trained to ask questions you're trained", "86:07", "to probe deeper than the layer

on it", "86:19", "and then when you're done learn this", "86:21", "well listen also there's a problem with", "86:24", "being in X or oblique connected to your", "86:26", "first belief do you when you have an", "86:29", "idea and it's in your head it's very", "86:31", "difficult for people to shake that ID", "86:32", "and they start arguing that idea that", "86:34", "idea becomes a part of their

it's one of the", "86:56", "reasons why I don't have tattoos on my", "86:58", "body but stretch in my face go on one of", "87:08", "the reasons is there's nothing I am so", "87:11", "sure about",

"87:36", "would override whatever was my decision", "87:38", "in that moment and since I count myself", "87:40", "among the lifelong learners I'm learning", "87:43", "stuff all the time they say wow that's", "87:48", "good I didn't know that well that's even", "87:51", "better what's something you learned", "87:53", "recently so you went oh okay let me let", "87:57", "me think hmm okay or something I learned", "88:02", "recently I think I knew this when I was", "88:03", "a kid but if you're playing basketball", "88:05", "and you're shooting okay and you say oh", "88:08", "that didn't go in oh my gosh well you", "88:10", "know the rim they should maybe make the", "88:11", "rim a little bigger IQ score more often", "88:13", "do you realize two basketballs can fit", "88:17", "exactly side by side through the opening", "88:20", "of a basketball hoop hmm really", "88:24", "yes I guess that makes sense two", "88:27", "basketballs top squeeze no it's not a", "88:29", "cosmically mind-blowing moment but that", "88:33", "gives you perspective next time you", "88:35", "watch a basketball game", "88:36", "it's how these guys can fly from the", "88:40", "from the foul line in a in an airborne", "88:44", "slam dunk and not miss because the area", "88:50", "of this opening is four times you do the", "88:54", "math it's four times as large as the", "88:56", "ball itself right because of the", "88:57", "different positions it could be so", "88:59", "they're multiple positions and they can", "89:00", "still do it", "89:02", "so it's not that that's easy to", "89:05", "accomplish but knowing this you realize", "89:09", "how much easier it is to score than you", "89:12", "might have otherwise thought I wonder if", "89:13", "basketball so that was a recent that was", "89:15", "a recent revelation that's a good", "89:17", "revelation yeah I wonder if basketball", "89:19", "players occasionally practice with a", "89:21", "smaller hole I think about this all the", "89:23", "time I said if I was a basketball player", "89:25", "you don't want to practice with", "89:26", "everyone saying yes because that venue", "89:28", "would that would throw the water off", "89:29", "your enjoy your practice with this and a", "89:31", "bigger ball they use a bigger ball we", "89:33", "use a ball sometimes it's almost as big", "89:35", "as their wait a minute is it heavier no", "89:36", "no no no you don't know you don't use a", "89:38", "bigger bowl it's a thing they did a long", "89:40", "time ago I bet they still don't they no", "89:42", "longer do it because then your grip is", "89:43", "different the grip has matters right", "89:46", "where your two hands go and what they", "89:48", "feel yeah so you want to do it you use a", "89:50", "smaller rim and in baseball you throw a", "89:53", "faster pitch to give you less reaction", "89:55", "time there a skinnier bat the pool table", "89:59", "is a very small pocket opening nice four", "90:02", "inch pocket opening is opposed to a five", "90:03", "and a half inch so it's quite a bit if", "90:05", "you're doing it you're doing it and so I", "90:09", "would also you know growing up I played", "90:11", "stickball in the street in New York and", "90:13", "so you're using basically a broom handle", "90:15", "and so when the first time you play", "90:20", "baseball officially it's like whoa yeah", "90:24", "I've got this huge bat and so stickball", "90:27", "players tend to transfer very well to", "90:30", "baseball when you're a kid yeah because", "90:33", "your instrument is bigger it is your a", "90:34", "the talent code no Daniel Coyle know one", "90:38", "of the interesting parts about it is", "90:39", "Brazilian soccer players how good they", "90:41", "are and they he attributed to a", "90:43", "different game that they play with a", "90:45", "heavier ball that they do indoors it's a", "90:48", "small heavy ball and because they do it", "90:51", "in tight quarters

soccer field I wonder if", "91:03", "they calculated that because what you", "91:06", "would do is let's say the ball weighs", "91:07", "twice as much then it would only go half", "91:09", "as far when you kicked it so then you", "91:11", "make a field half as large I don't think", "91:14", "they did then you can reproduce almost", "91:16", "all of the dynamics of the soccer game I", "91:18", "think it was based on just trying to", "91:20", "play games like how far you can rub it", "91:22", "in over if it's balls twice as heavy you", "91:24", "throw it half as far the field is half", "91:26", "the size right and then you have a mini", "91:28", "game they survive right that makes sense", "91:31", "there's a whole fun exercise you can do", "91:33", "playing sports on other planets with", "91:35", "different ground it's a very very fun", "91:37", "thing to do if you're a dork", "91:42", "you know it's funny occasionally I'll", "91:44", "tweet something and people say dork and", "91:47", "I say yeah thanks for the compliment", "91:50", "okay it's already a bath it used to be a", "91:54", "dork as well", "91:55", "you give wedgies to the Nerds yeah well", "91:57", "the Nerds would also be the people that", "91:59", "were like but now a nerd is like you can", "92:01", "be a science nerd and people like it", "92:04", "that's a go yeah yeah I'm an old movie", "92:06", "nerd

yeah I", "100:02", "don't know the details of how the", "100:04", "physiology of the natives huh", "100:07", "dealt with that or whether it mutated", "100:09", "you know I don't and there may people",

when", "100:19", "he came back so what I'm saying is this", "100:23", "was a hugely significant event the", "100:26", "rejoining of the branches of the human", "100:28", "species but ya know I would imagine that", "100:31", "that makes sense that is the most", "100:32", "important", "100:33", "and by the way Native Americans you know", "100:35", "this famous infamous problem with", "100:38",

"100:51", "stayed in it so you look at who", "100:53", "populated North and South America after", "100:57", "the you know before the landbridge is", "100:58", "whoever was right at the edge of Asia", "101:00", "right then the land bridge is so-so", "101:03", "Asians and and North American and and", "101:06", "the natives of North and South America", "101:08", "have more in common with each other", "101:11", "because of this then most other pairs of", "101:14", "groups you might grab around the world", "101:16", "but my point is obviously we there's a", "101:19", "lot to blame Columbus for but he just", "101:21", "happened to be the guy who did it first", "101:23", "Europe was coming to the new world no", "101:25", "matter what that everybody was trying to", "101:27", "find a faster trade route to the Indies", "101:29", "and so if what if it wasn't Columbus it", "101:32", "would have been Arnold's Mednick or", "101:34", "whatever it doesn't matter", "101:35", "somebody did that and the rest is as", "101:38", "they say history Wow", "101:40", "so personally I think it's the most", "101:42", "significant thing to happen in our", "101:44", "species otherwise we'd still be two", "101:46", "stranded branches of humans it would be", "101:50", "fascinating though like Australia", "101:52", "stranded to see what would happen if it", "101:54", "this has gone on for hundreds of", "101:56", "thousands of years hundred thousand that", "101:57", "would have been a different story right", "101:59", "yeah and your immunities would be", "102:01", "different your yeah well that's the big", "102:04", "concern about aliens right one of the", "102:06", "big concerns is that there's some sort", "102:07", "of a virus you pick up from somewhere I", "102:10", "think that's harder to accept so for", "102:14", "example what are the chances that a oak", "102:19", "tree would catch whooping cough not so", "102:23", "good we're two different species so", "102:24", "viruses tend to be very species targeted", "102:28", "yeah but what about species sure they", "102:32", "can jump species but so there's a jump", "102:35", "mammal to mammal does it vertebrate to", "102:36", "vertebrate but so yes that can happen", "102:40", "but the more different the life-form is", "102:43", "it is sensible to suppose that the less", "102:46", "likely", "102:47", "you're gonna share the same diseases", "102:48", "that's all but NASA regardless has", "102:51", "safeguards in place in the event that", "102:53", "that happens so it's it's called the", "102:57", "planetary protection program

Saturn in its death when", "103:19", "we were done with it and ran out of", "103:22", "money we're done with it plunged into", "103:23", "Saturn to vaporize we didn't leave in an", "103:25", "orbit around Saturn why because it might", "103:27", "have crashed into one of Saturn's moons", "103:30", "that might have life and if someone had", "103:34", "sneezed on the spacecraft before it got", "103:36", "launched we don't want to contaminate", "103:37", "the life that we were later gonna one", "103:39", "day want to study so that's what so we", "103:43", "plunged it into Saturn that's why that", "103:46", "is why because they were worried about", "103:47", "let maybe in hitting Europa once it's", "103:49", "dead and you can't track it or guide it", "103:52", "anymore then it's a it's a while it's a", "103:54", "wild card it might hit your Europa is a", "103:57", "moon of Jupiter but yeah Enceladus there", "104:00", "are other moons that have sort of ocean", "104:03", "water their water world's basically and", "104:05", "so the concern is that we would", "104:07", "introduce life suppose we did it crashed", "104:09", "and then we go back later and find life", "104:11", "and it has DNA just like here but was it", "104:14", "our life that we contaminated with that", "104:16", "you don't want to confuse the future", "104:18", "science of it so that's a that's the", "104:20", "plan", "104:21", "can you even watch a science movie like", "104:23", "science fiction movies I know you had a", "104:24", "real problem with gravity boom yeah", "104:25", "alright so I let me set the record", "104:28", "straight here okay I mean let me just go", "104:31", "on record okay okay I've been deeply", "104:35", "misunderstood with my comments on movies", "104:38", "deeply misunderstood deeply deeply and", "104:42", "so I've just stopped most last time you", "104:45", "saw a movie comment in my Twitter stream", "104:47", "we haven't you haven't I've kind of just", "104:50", "stopped wasn't the Matthew McConaughey", "104:52", "movie did you comment on that one oh", "104:55", "interstellar just oh that's the last one", "104:58", "I commented on", "104:59", "a big way right you've done yeah I'm", "105:01", "done because people then thought I've", "105:05", "just being nitpicky I did one it's not", "105:07", "fun going in movies with you yeah why", "105:09", "would you do that Tyson will just say", "105:11", "that can never happen and so so my", "105:15", "intent was my intent did not match how", "105:19", "people received my intent my intent is", "105:21", "here's an observation that I think if", "105:25", "you understood this it would enhance", "105:26", "your appreciation of the movie let me", "105:28", "give an example please do Star Wars The", "105:30", "Force awakens they've got one was that", "105:33", "that's the one with that introduced a", "105:36", "bb-8 okay that's the most recent no no", "105:39", "no this is like four movies ago now plus", "105:41", "I've lost track because there's another", "105:42", "one okay so the one to introduce bb-8", "105:44", "cutest cute as ever", "105:45", "okay our cute little fella and in there", "105:48", "they have their like the the updated", "105:51", "Death Star right okay remember the old", "105:54", "Death Star has enough power to destroy a", "105:56", "planet and that's devastating this one", "105:59", "it can suck energy out of a star so that", "106:03", "the star no longer exists", "106:05", "hmm then it could take these energy", "106:09", "beams and kill six planets at once it's", "106:12", "no longer just a one planet killer six", "106:14", "or eight whatever the number was it was", "106:16", "like high single digits okay well I did", "106:19", "the math on this and I tweeted and I I", "106:23", "said first okay they did take all the", "106:26", "energy from a star you become a star but", "106:29", "let's not maybe they've got a", "106:30", "containment mechanism I'll give it to", "106:32", "them it is the future after all honey is", "106:34", "the future but what a long time ago in a", "106:37", "galaxy far yeah that's another another", "106:39", "another universe of civilizations", "106:41", "okay mass but they have Lightspeed and", "106:43", "we don't so it's the future of our", "106:45", "technology even if it's the past of our",

a", "107:04", "thousand planets oh my gosh they under", "107:08", "represented the energy that it sucked", "107:11", "out of the Xhosa tar out of the snow", "107:12", "hmm and I thought this could have been", "107:15", "more badass than even they came up with", "107:18", "in this movie that is the nature of my", "107:21", "comments mmm not what could this happen", "107:24", "could it not happen

or render them", "147:46", "incapable of fighting you this is why", "147:49", "the attacks on September 11th worked", "147:51", "because we had a policy that if someone", "147:54", "wants to hijack a

of course you don't I I", "149:52", "thought about not that but I thought to", "149:54", "myself the plane that way because I was", "149:55", "like I witnessed September 11th four", "149:57", "blocks six blocks away from six walking", "150:00", "blocks for did you miss that plane hit", "150:03", "no because that was my view is blocked", "150:04", "from the south so but I have camcorder", "150:07", "footage of the explosion big explosion", "150:10", "I've ever seen", "150:11", "and by the way one thing I noticed is", "150:13", "that there was no shockwave I might have", "150:17", "been the closest scientist to the event", "150:19", "so I was all I could through was apply", "150:22", "every bit of physics that I know there", "150:24", "was no shockwave I said well how can we", "150:26", "have an explosion in no shockwave and I", "150:29", "later learned if you kind of make a", "150:30", "deflagration wave if you Adam I as fuel", "150:33", "and then you spark it then the flame", "150:36", "moves across the fuel it's not a it's", "150:38", "not a shockwave it's just a deflagration", "150:40", "wave and therefore there's no shockwave", "150:42", "and so windows are not blown

"150:58", "September 11 the plane oh yeah oh yeah", "151:02", "so here's something I calculated I said", "151:04", "if I was in a 767 and we're about to", "151:06", "crash into a building if I was in the", "151:10", "last row of the plane how much time", "151:14", "would elapse before the front row", "151:18", "crumbled and it met me in the back row", "151:24", "given the speed of the plane going into", "151:27", "the building 500 miles an hour yeah well", "151:29", "it's probably slower than that by then I", "151:31", "would say closer to 400 it's a known", "151:33", "speed and I don't know it but I don't", "151:34", "think it was because you can't turn at", "151:36", "that highest speed and it had to like", "151:38", "turn around in a name I say it's about a", "151:41", "second less half a fraction of a second", "151:44", "it's a fraction so the question is tiny", "151:46", "for how long does it take a plane to go", "151:48", "its own length right when it's going at", "151:51", "400 miles out yeah it's a fraction so", "151:55", "it's like that's it you can't even", "151:56", "process that so I figured the deaths", "151:59", "were pretty quick Wow instantaneous yes", "152:02", "basically instantaneous you are you are", "152:04", "pulverized pile of goo are they planning", "152:09", "on making spaceships that can shoot down", "152:13", "other spaceships so here so any space", "152:15", "wars would not be war between space and", "152:17", "earth it would be between stuff in space", "152:19", "that's all stuff in space like space", "152:22", "space yeah space to space yeah here's", "152:26", "another question they're gonna do with", "152:27", "all that stuff that's just floating", "152:28", "around up there the debris yeah how", "152:31", "about another task of a space force why", "152:32", "don't you clean up space for so that we", "152:34", "can have tourism and not risk our lives", "152:37", "by a paint chip or you know going 18,000", "152:40", "more bolt or nut moving at 18,000 miles", "152:46", "an hour that'll put a hole straight", "152:47", "through you Yeah right so yeah I would", "152:50", "like to see the portfolio of a space", "152:52", "force if there is a space force", "152:54", "broadened the scope of that to include", "152:57", "protecting us from asteroids and", "152:59", "figuring out a way to clean up the", "153:01", "debris of space is there a concept in", "153:03", "place no no no boy when you look at that", "153:09", "map but I know the map is not the scale", "153:11", "but it shows you the known satellites in", "153:13", "space oh well there it's it's to scale", "153:15", "in the sense that they're there there's", "153:18", "that many of them it's just as those", "153:21", "relative distance - but they have a lot", "153:23", "you can see their orbital line so it", "153:24", "feels crowded but it's it's so crazy", "153:26", "when you look at it it's just like like", "153:28", "it's just littered and we're continuing", "153:31", "to launch new things up there then I", "153:32", "joke I say one of the reasons why we've", "153:34", "never been tada a lien is because they", "153:37", "came to earth it what is all that junk", "153:39", "what oh we're not risking our lab let's", "153:41", "go to another planet yeah they didn't", "153:43", "know the map of where everything was", "153:45", "they had to calculate their income and", "153:46", "forget it they'll just take home it's", "153:48", "not worth it yeah I mean in when you're", "153:49", "on your way in you have to think about", "153:51", "it going around", "153:51", "you were visiting another planet that", "153:53", "had a civilization and they left a lot", "153:55", "of crap in their atmosphere you you", "153:59", "would yeah well those that's not the", "154:00", "debris that's those are the satellites", "154:01", "yeah so if you know that is debris no", "154:05", "you got it so so the the airforce tracks", "154:08", "debris as does NASA they both track", "154:11", "debris and sometimes launch windows of", "154:14", "spacecraft pieces of shit that's crazy", "154:23", "so we're so crazy we've only been doing", "154:27", "this for 60 years", "154:28", "so you track it right Mo's lost the", "154:31", "first satellite for sound Sputnik excuse", "154:33", "me what year 62 far away from you slap", "154:37", "you sorry", "154:39", "it was it Sputnik October 4th 1957 57", "154:43", "the first artificial anything in orbit", "154:46", "around the earth and on that day there", "154:48", "was only one thing one thing only Wow", "154:52", "from 57 to 2018 right so it's 60 years", "154:56", "Wow one thing that's crazy and now how", "154:59", "many things well there's the countless", "155:02", "debris there's hundreds of active", "155:04", "satellites there's thousands if you", "155:06", "include the dead ones and yes we have no", "155:10", "way to clean it up maybe it's some big", "155:12", "vacuum one day I don't know but yeah", "155:15", "space vacuum they'd have to be valuable", "155:18", "oh you know you could probably sell", "155:20", "space debris if you brought it back to", "155:22", "earth yeah people are dumb they'd buy it", "155:29", "speaking of debris speaking of debris", "155:32", "there was this asteroid that collided", "155:35", "with earth over chaya Binks in the", "155:39", "Soviet Union in Russia sorry", "155:42", "just near the Siberia in the Ural", "155:45", "Mountains just on the coast of Siberia", "155:46", "on the border of Siberia that was", "155:50", "visible to everybody in broad daylight", "155:52", "and he had to like avert your eyes when", "155:54", "it happened and they felt a shock wave", "155:56", "and the shock wave broke windows and", "155:57", "sent 600 people nearly a thousand people", "156:01", "to the hospital", "156:02", "what happened well because they saw the", "156:05", "light and they can't they got up from", "156:07", "their table and went to the window to", "156:09", "see what had happened there's a time", "156:12", "delay between the shock wave and the", "156:13", "light whose light travels fast and sound", "156:17", "travels slow so we'll go to the windows", "156:19", "and the shock wave hits and it blasts", "156:21", "broken glass into their face so it's a", "156:23", "big band-aid collision that we had the", "156:27", "injured people all needed basically", "156:29", "band-aids okay no one died but nearly a", "156:31", "thousand people were injured so at an", "156:34", "auction but that actually exploded and", "156:38", "pieces of it were recovered at an", "156:41", "auction I purchased a piece of that", "156:43", "meteorite but you know and also I", "156:44", "purchased some of the shards of glass", "156:48", "that the shock wave had broken what do", "156:51", "you do with this shit I've got it it's", "156:52", "just a habit", "156:53", "I'm on the part of it is a shot across", "156:56", "our bow that's what that no one died but", "157:00", "it's a warning there's no better way to", "157:02", "be warned than to have a band-aid cover", "157:06", "your injuries that could have vaporized", "157:08", "you or rendered your species extinct", "157:10", "what's crazy is the ones that don't even", "157:12", "make impact still do devastating damage", "157:14", "yes Tunguska yes that did that one", "157:16", "detach earth well right it incinerated", "157:19", "ten thousand square kilometers of forest", "157:21", "honk holy shit", "157:23", "yeah so if every 15 2013 and there is a", "157:28", "ways over a half a ton that Peter Rock", "157:30", "was a thousand pounds oh yeah holy", "157:32", "that's just a piece that made it through", "157:34", "is it iron well the actual piece would", "157:37", "have been about the size of this room so", "157:41", "a small home Wow", "157:42", "so that's amazing that that small rock", "157:45", "go back up to that again please", "157:46", "look at the size of that that's not that", "157:48", "no no that's what's left over most of it", "157:50", "except a per eyes on that on the", "157:53", "explosion as it came through the Atmos", "157:54", "right but they're saying that that piece", "157:56", "of it weighs a thousand pounds do they", "157:59", "give it the weight of it yeah okay he's", "158:01", "over a half ton yeah oh we have done", "158:03", "yeah a thousand pounds that's crazy", "158:05", "that rock is that fucking heavy yeah so", "158:08", "it's soda so yes", "158:10", "well I have to read that to know for", "158:12", "sure but I think it was an iron", "158:13", "meteorite I'll tell you something would", "158:15", "I", "158:15", "a knife that was made out of a piece of", "158:18", "meat or as do I though the beautiful", "158:20", "hole yeah it's a kitchen knife that I", "158:22", "use Oh mine is like a it's like a", "158:24", "Crocodile Dundee knife oh yeah", "158:27", "though that's not a knife awesome ah", "158:28", "there's that's nice but it's waiting I", "158:31", "want to make a or get someone to make a", "158:33", "handle for it it's just that it's just a", "158:35", "metal that would be that would then", "158:37", "wedged for it's a forged metal with the", "158:40", "blade but then you get a pearl handle", "158:41", "attached to the base of oh yeah so it's", "158:44", "a handle this and it's an unadorned", "158:49", "piece of metal that would become a you", "158:52", "know the right oh yes sharpen oh yeah", "158:57", "where's the fucking handle there is the", "158:59", "metal hey have you ever seen a kitchen", "159:02", "knives the metal goes all the way down", "159:04", "down the center of the handle and you", "159:06", "screw wooden handles on the sides so you", "159:08", "just need the wooden I just need the", "159:09", "wood or the or the if I'm patent they", "159:12", "would be purl you know yeah yeah purl", "159:19", "pistol yeah so so yeah it's part of", "159:23", "history and it's a reminder that if you", "159:26", "want to think about the future of", "159:27", "civilization you have to include a", "159:30", "defence plan against asteroids yeah", "159:32", "the dinosaurs dinosaurs I bet if they", "159:36", "could they would have had a space", "159:38", "program to not go extinct I wouldn't", "159:40", "know shit no is there anything that", "159:46", "we're doing now other than we're", "159:49", "occasionally looking up yeah we're", "159:50", "looking with monitoring and cataloging", "159:53", "them yeah but we don't really know what", "159:54", "to do yeah so happen the day would come", "159:56", "well we know what to do there's nothing", "159:57", "funded with their engineering", "159:58", "conferences how would you deflect an", "160:00", "asteroid", "160:00", "how would you destroy us we see one and", "160:02", "it's a we see one way and it's coming", "160:06", "100%", "160:06", "kiss your ass good-bye that's right we", "160:09", "would we would have the power to tell", "160:10", "you when you would die and what part of", "160:11", "earth it would hit yes people that have", "160:13", "very delusional ideas about what we can", "160:15", "and can't do with asteroids and that", "160:17", "drives me crazy", "160:18", "we know how did the scene the", "160:21", "engineering plans they look very good", "160:22", "but there's nothing in place right", "160:24", "there's project Sentinel you can look at", "160:26", "that is has tasked themselves with", "160:28", "organizing world governments to protect", "160:31", "Earth from species killing asteroids and", "160:33", "you need the world because you don't", "160:35", "know in advance until it's discovered", "160:38", "what part of Earth it's gonna hit and if", "160:39", "it's going to hit in the Indian Ocean", "160:41", "and if Indian if the surrounding regions", "160:47", "don't have a space program or if are the", "160:49", "countries that do have a space program", "160:50", "going to sit idle no what you want to do", "160:53", "is you want to have a fund and every", "160:56", "country pipes in a little bit of their", "160:58", "GDP and then or whatever but you know", "161:03", "you measure it however you want it", "161:04", "whatever you think is fair do it the way", "161:07", "the way the UN does it okay so there's a", "161:11", "tax of the world relative to your wealth", "161:13", "and then that money pays to save the", "161:16", "world when we find such an asteroid that", "161:17", "that's how the Sentinel project Sentinel", "161:20", "is is has thought this through", "161:23", "so if they're engineers and scientists", "161:26", "ample time there's possible there's a", "161:29", "possibility that they could actually", "161:30", "implement some of these plans it's all", "161:31", "about how much time you have because", "161:32", "what you want to do is go out and nudge", "161:34", "it alright a little bit if you a little", "161:36", "bit you just have to give it a sideways", "161:38", "velocity relative to its path towards", "161:41", "Earth if you do that early enough the", "161:45", "the sideways velocity sort of", "161:47", "accumulates right like ship turning", "161:49", "slightly over the ocean over the course", "161:51", "of time it'll deviate quite a bit", "161:53", "correct so that angle grows I mean it's", "161:56", "the same angle but the it spreads out", "161:58", "and if the the ocean example is perfect", "162:00", "is a perfect analogy so if you that", "162:02", "early enough you do it enough so that it", "162:04", "misses earth and it's still out there to", "162:06", "harm you in another day but it won't", "162:07", "render you extinct on that passage how", "162:09", "much time do we need today if I would", "162:15", "say we could probably get something", "162:17", "built in ten years oh no oh my gosh so a", "162:26", "year if we have a year the good thing", "162:29", "about species killing asteroids is that", "162:32", "they're large and visible what about", "162:34", "city killing ones them boulders slip", "162:36", "through yeah they'll slip through", "162:39", "yeah but most of Earth's surface is not", "162:41", "City so it'll probably hit the ocean or", "162:43", "land but yeah if it does it would take", "162:46", "out a city yeah there's a branch of", "162:52", "government part of I don't if it", "162:53", "survived the Trump changeover but it's", "162:56", "it's part of Homeland Security where it", "163:00", "worries about devastation to a region", "163:04", "where the grid is taken out as well so", "163:07", "you can't bring emergency services that", "163:10", "bring either food water medicines any", "163:14", "other form of transportation or", "163:16", "communication how much thaws there to", "163:18", "putting in a more robust grid I yeah", "163:24", "what you would need is that's that's a", "163:25", "good point", "163:26", "so you need a grid that can sort of", "163:29", "rewire itself rapidly to then bring", "163:32", "power to a region that's what you would", "163:36", "need and it would sort of doing that now", "163:38", "making a grid sort of lightning proof", "163:41", "you know power surge proof I grew up in", "163:46", "New York City where there were a couple", "163:47", "of very famous blackouts one in 1966", "163:49", "another in when was in 1978 I think and", "163:54", "there was like whoa how should this how", "163:57", "is this even allowed you don't have a", "164:00", "back-up plan yeah you'll have a way to", "164:02", "rewire this to redirect the electricity", "164:04", "so yeah you'd need that you'd want that", "164:08", "and I thought the new grid is supposed", "164:11", "to have those kinds of protections built", "164:12",

gun and you don't drop it", "172:27", "it means stuff can happen to you in", "172:29", "combat and it is always attached to your", "172:31", "body so I said so when I got my phone I", "172:35", "said let me just do this ok let me just", "172:41", "do this if I pick up the phone and so", "172:48", "when you do that then you never drop", "172:51", "your phone so it's not that I'm a", "172:53",

doing well", "174:00", "here six months this fat stupid fingers", "174:03", "so once you do once you get that then it", "174:07", "doesn't drop so it's not that I'm a", "174:09", "risk-taker is I've changed the risk so", "174:11", "that is low enough so that it is of on", "174:14", "part on par with other risks that you", "174:16", "take routinely I smoked a lot of pot", "174:18", "dude this is gonna drop I keep doing", "174:19", "this also the things if you pick up the", "174:23", "phone with one hand and it's upside down", "174:25", "you you hold it in places where the", "174:28", "center of gravity flips it but you also", "174:30", "have some sort of a skin in the back", "174:32", "which it's just it's just a sector of", "174:35", "Van Gogh's Starry Night oh yeah but it's", "174:38", "not it's there's no texture to this it's", "174:40", "just a slippery yeah oh it's a skin it's", "174:44", "definitely more texture you say feel", "174:47", "that that's slicker it's complicated", "174:49", "it's not wise there but my point is", "174:51", "there's no ways there but it will aid in", "174:52", "the friction a little scientists you", "174:54", "should recognize this friction is good", "174:56", "yes I mean isn't it one of the things", "174:57", "they decided to do to asteroids to", "174:59", "change their path spray some goo on them", "175:01", "and it'll literally cause more friction", "175:04", "in the air and cause them to deviate", "175:05", "slightly from their path no over a long", "175:07", "period of time I don't know where you", "175:08", "just pull that out of your ass pray in", "175:11", "that moment know I've read that I mean", "175:14", "it was some dummy vacuum of space there", "175:18", "is no friction so didn't there's some", "175:20", "shit they could put on the if it's", "175:22", "traveling right yes isn't there", "175:24", "something they could put on that would", "175:25", "aerodynamically change its path in the", "175:28", "vacuum of space there is no aerodynamics", "175:30", "okay so it's moving others by the time", "175:32", "it hits Earth's atmosphere it's too late", "175:34", "so it happens so it's what there was a", "175:36", "coating that they were planning on", "175:38", "putting on some aspect of would it be", "175:41", "the act of putting the coating that's", "175:42", "what you would do is you may be thinking", "175:44", "of there's a coating you can put on an", "175:45", "asteroid that differently absorbs", "175:49", "sunlight relative to the other side so", "175:52", "it caused it a spin that put there that", "175:54", "can that can create a net a vector", "175:57", "of motion is many asteroids could", "176:01", "protect the Earth from space rock threat", "176:03", "okay so there you go that's some shit", "176:09", "mm-hmm okay", "176:10", "change him out of sunlight reflected by", "176:13", "the space but you would not do that the", "176:15", "entire rock you do it to a part of the", "176:17",

hit all of", "176:52", "them yeah we hit all of them we didn't", "176:55", "hit innovation in all their cares", "176:56", "worries no no here's one Oh we'd never", "176:58", "even got into cars", "176:59", "yeah just line cars why they'll never be", "177:01", "flying cars yeah please okay since we're", "177:05", "two hours and 40 minutes in is that", "177:08", "allowed oh my gosh yeah we're flying no", "177:10", "but people don't have three hours to do", "177:13", "they oh we do it all the time really", "177:15", "yeah oh are you sure hundred percent", "177:17", "yeah this is not you sure yeah average", "177:20", "podcast right now lavage really yeah I'm", "177:24", "honored to please your average the ones", "177:26", "we've done we've all been like close to", "177:28", "three-hour okay here is that ding oh oh", "177:32", "it's rude okay so let me I flipped it I", "177:34", "turn that goddamn switch on okay so", "177:37", "let's go back to let's go back to why", "177:42", "anyone would want a flying car in the", "177:44", "first place because they're an asshole", "177:45", "okay so here is stuck in traffic so here", "177:48", "at Edison everybody just watch let's say", "177:50", "there was only one road okay okay that", "177:53", "was the width of your car and you're", "177:56", "driving on this road and they're cars", "177:59", "behind you the fastest you could go on", "178:02", "that road is the speed of the slowest", "178:04", "car on the road right make sense yes", "178:06", "this is travel in one dimension", "178:10", "that sucks what you really want is", "178:13", "travel in two dimensions so you take the", "178:16", "road and widen it let's make two lanes", "178:20", "two lanes in one direction you have to", "178:22", "the other way as well this doesn't", "178:24", "matter here don't have too late so now I", "178:26", "can go around you your slow ass car mmm", "178:31", "okay but and that's fine this is a great", "178:35", "improvement on one-dimensional travel", "178:38", "now it's two dimensions okay I can shift", "178:43", "left or right as well as move forward or", "178:46", "backwards to move and the more lanes you", "178:50", "have the more two-dimensional that is", "178:53", "okay so four or five here in Los Angeles", "178:56", "what is it six lanes each is twelve", "178:58", "fricking lanes okay you are fully", "179:01", "exploiting the two dimensionality of", "179:03", "travel but you still have so many cars", "179:06", "that you say to yourself I want to", "179:09", "bypass this traffic if you went

thinking I need to travel", "179:22", "in another dimension I want to travel in", "179:25", "the third dimension if I do that I can", "179:29", "bypass all these cars I want a flying", "179:32", "car yeah okay well the point is we", "179:37", "already have flying cars they call", "179:40", "helicopters well the helicopters have", "179:42", "originally invented for that they called", "179:44",

to", "181:21", "appreciate moving in the third dimension", "181:23", "the New York City subway system moves a", "181:26", "billion people a year and they all go in", "181:30", "the third dimension

all you barely hear you", "189:11", "barely hear it and so next time you're", "189:14", "at a runway", "189:14", "and when it's landing it's much noisier", "189:16", "taking off because it's got a gained", "189:18", "altitude but coming down it's most of", "189:21", "that sound is glider noise and evidence", "189:23", "of this is is the noise of air going", "189:27", "over the airfoil of the
