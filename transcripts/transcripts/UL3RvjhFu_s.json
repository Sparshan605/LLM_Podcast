"32:06", "removed to Oklahoma and by the way", "32:09", "because of that removal their tribes", "32:12", "that were already there were removed so", "32:16", "there were already tribes there that", "32:18", "Caddo and Comanche and other other", "32:20", "tribes that this was already their land", "32:23", "so new tribes moved in and land during", "32:31", "the hmm I'm forgetting my dates now but", "32:37", "there was a commission around 1906 or so", "32:43", "where there was a census and individual", "32:51", "Indians were allotted about a hundred", "32:53", "and sixty acres apiece", "32:56", "and this was an effort to decrease the", "32:59", "amount of land base that tribes held in", "33:02", "common right and this happened all", "33:04", "across the country not just in Oklahoma", "33:07", "where there were allotment policies", "33:09", "and I believe there there were about", "33:15", "heck I'm not good with numbers I think", "33:17", "there were like 19 million acres that", "33:19", "that were removed this way of land but", "33:24", "what happened today there is a criminal", "33:28", "case before the Supreme Court that is", "33:31", "actually addressing these issues because", "33:34", "even though our lands were allotted the", "33:36", "exterior boundaries of our reservations", "33:38", "the area that we had agreed to live in", "33:41", "they've never been extinguished they've", "33:44", "never been diminished and so the Supreme", "33:48", "Court says act Supreme Court is actually", "33:50", "looking at this issue now as to whether", "33:53", "we still have jurisdiction within the", "33:57", "exterior boundaries of our reservations", "33:59", "in Oklahoma would that extend to cities", "34:03", "other cities in Oklahoma that are in", "34:06", "those areas now yeah so if you think of", "34:08", "Tulsa yeah so that's Creek Nation so it", "34:12", "also would be owned well so not", "34:18", "necessarily so so it's raised a lot of", "34:20", "fear with with non-indians about why", "34:23", "yeah the Indians were taken back the", "34:25", "land oh my god but what would actually", "34:29", "happen there's a lot of places in Indian", "34:31", "country where there's allotment and", "34:33", "there's there's non-indian individuals", "34:36", "who have feel and within exterior", "34:38", "boundaries of reservations and then", "34:40", "individual Indians owning feel and", "34:43", "within the exterior boundaries", "34:44", "reservation land feel and so just how", "34:47", "you woody", "34:47", "no no so how you own land it's called", "34:51", "it's not restricted it's it's in fee you", "34:55", "own the title to that land right a lot", "34:58", "of land held by tribes is in trust or in", "35:01", "restricted fee so a common area land", "35:07", "like like let's look at them the", "35:10", "Onondaga Nation in in New York State", "35:13", "they have the exterior boundaries of", "35:16", "their reservation they own restricted", "35:19", "feel and so they own it but they can't", "35:23", "without us permission right trust land", "35:27", "is similar and it's treated the same as", "35:29", "restricted fee but it's held in trust so", "35:33", "the US has more control of what happens", "35:36", "on that land or has been seen to have a", "35:39", "little more control than it would and", "35:41", "just restricted fee but within the", "35:44", "exterior boundaries of the reservation", "35:45", "you can have this checkerboarded", "35:49", "ownership of land of non-indians and", "35:51", "Indians and and but that doesn't", "35:55", "necessarily mean that the tribe has", "35:57", "jurisdiction over the non-indian feel", "36:01", "and and the the civil and criminal", "36:05", "jurisdiction issues on an area of land", "36:09", "like that is extremely complex and", "36:12", "continues to be argued in the courts and", "36:18", "most of the time our jurisdiction", "36:24", "most of the time we lose those cases", "36:27", "especially since the 80s and 90s and up", "36:34", "until today we've there was really a", "36:37", "change in kind of how the Supreme Court", "36:40", "decided Indian law cases so if we go", "36:44", "back into the history of federal Indian", "36:47", "policy you see this kind of weird", "36:49", "schizophrenic you know those those those", "36:52", "Marshall cases that I talked about they", "36:55", "really set forward kind of schizophrenic", "36:57", "principles that the Indians are", "36:59", "sovereign but they're they're just a", "37:01", "ward and they're uncivilized so we have", "37:04", "to take care of them but their sovereign", "37:05", "and so you have a different areas of", "37:08", "eras of time policymakers who who", "37:12", "support tribal sovereignty and we'll use", "37:14", "those cases to help support that", "37:16", "sovereignty and then there are other", "37:18", "administrations that come around not", "37:22", "talking about any current administration", "37:25", "but that that used those cases against", "37:30", "us and in degrade policy and degrade any", "37:33", "kind of rights that we may have gained", "37:35", "in", "37:37", "other eras so it's it's really been you", "37:40", "know Indians today live in this live in", "37:45", "such an insecure world you know our", "37:48", "statistics are horrible", "37:50", "you know the suicide rate for our youth", "37:54", "our high school graduates everything", "37:58", "that you could possibly think of there's", "38:00", "a statistic on we're usually the lowest",

that's the thing about trying to", "58:29", "work with auctions and private", "58:30", "collectors as they often don't want to", "58:32", "work with us because they're trying to", "58:34", "make money so oftentimes items whether", "58:39", "they're religious objects or human", "58:41", "remains they have a story or what's", "58:44", "called a provenance associated with them", "58:47", "that is

"collector to talk to us so the collector", "59:00", "is under no obligation by law to talk to", "59:02", "you know why we try to send the FBI in", "59:07", "our friend Tim carpenter to them so how", "59:10", "would they determine they mean wouldn't", "59:12", "they have to do a DNA analysis of the", "59:14", "bones and try to figure out where who", "59:17", "the person was well the DNA analysis", "59:20", "isn't necessarily going to tell you", "59:23", "where it came from it could tell you", "59:25", "that it was Native American would they", "59:27", "even be able to get that out of bones I", "59:29", "don't know and I'm not a scientist but", "59:32", "you know there was a there was a case", "59:35", "really not that long ago called the", "59:38", "Kennewick Man case I don't know if maybe", "59:40", "you heard of it but it was a an ancestor", "59:45", "was uncovered in in the state of", "59:47", "Washington", "59:48", "and he was old old old old and the", "59:53", "universities involved in the Army Corps", "59:55", "who had possession of it we're going to", "60:00", "repatriate it to appropriate tribes and", "60:03", "what ended up happening is that you know", "60:05",

ancient one back and finally", "60:20", "after a court case that deemed the item", "60:26", "wasn't that the ancestor wasn't Native", "60:28", "American DNA test was done and it was", "60:33", "indeed Native American and and the", "60:35", "ancestor was finally repatriated to how", "60:40", "that works", "60:41", "so yeah listen there's you said there's", "60:43", "five hundred recognized tribes many more", "60:46", "that are unrecognized who would that go", "60:49", "to right so like say if you won and it's", "60:54", "brought back and given to Native", "60:56", "Americans to who and to where right so", "60:59", "so so let's look at the best-case", "61:02", "scenario and in in a lot of museums have", "61:06", "maintained records that may have human", "61:09", "remains and associated funerary objects", "61:11", "and have enough information to know", "61:14", "where that came from what side it was", "61:17", "located at what County what state and we", "61:21", "know from tribal

"institution what has been the history of", "62:04", "the institution and where has it", "62:06", "obtained different collections and", "62:08", "through that you know it's deduced who", "62:13", "may be affiliated with with those those", "62:16", "items or the the ancestors so it can be", "62:19", "a pretty long drawn-out process but", "62:23", "what's interesting about it as museums", "62:26", "and other institutions fought this law", "62:28", "for a long time and they said well you", "62:32", "know all of our collections will you", "62:34", "know we won't be able to fulfill our", "62:36", "purpose as a museum or an academic", "62:38", "institution to study these things it's", "62:41", "like well hell you haven't studied it in", "62:43", "a hundred years", "62:45", "ya know most most of

somewhere in storage right", "63:01", "so the museum owns it and they're kind", "63:04", "of hoarding it yeah interesting yeah so", "63:07", "this Kennewick Man can you pull up some", "63:09",

to help internet", "123:28", "with international repatriation we're", "123:32", "also trying to watch private collectors", "123:35", "and educate people about the importance", "123:39", "of returning

one one area we have a", "124:01", "repatriation conference every year that", "124:04", "we work together with tribes and", "124:06", "institutions and in foreign governments", "124:09", "to work on these issues sacred sites I", "124:12", "just was before the indigenous peoples", "124:16", "subcommittee in the house a few weeks", "124:18", "ago talking about what's going on at the", "124:21", "border and that Atum chairman was there", "124:26", "as well", "124:27", "to talk about those issues and as he", "124:29", "spoke he was he was telling the Congress", "124:33", "representatives that he just found out", "124:36", "that they were blowing up another", "124:38", "section you know so it's it's and that", "124:43", "is happening because there was a law in", "124:45", "2005 that allowed Department of Homeland", "124:49", "Security to waive all these", "124:51", "environmental laws and if there was an", "124:52", "emergency to do so and so the", "124:55", "administration is is saying that the", "124:57", "border wall is an emergency that allows", "125:00", "them to waive all these environmental", "125:02", "laws and so it's not just about", "125:05", "protecting sacred sites but all the", "125:07", "other environmental concerns all the the", "125:10", "animal migrations birds plants as and", "125:15", "water quality that are being affected by", "125:18", "this border wall because people strongly", "125:23", "think we need a 30 foot you know tall", "125:28", "border so so we're working we continue", "125:31", "to work to protect sacred sites so along", "125:34", "the border what we're we're they're", "125:36", "doing this and putting in the wall many", "125:38", "of these areas have been designated as", "125:40", "sacred sites and so is that what's what", "125:42", "you're saying yeah our known sacred", "125:44", "sites and there's artifacts there and", "125:46", "all sorts of different things that can", "125:47", "be destroyed by the construction age", "125:48", "they blew up an area and found human", "125:52", "remains oh Jesus mm-hmm yeah no do they", "125:55", "stop when they do that they were paid", "125:57", "created those bones and they kept going", "126:01", "yeah so this this is how that's it", "126:04", "that's it that's it they're just moving", "126:06", "forward they don't identify the bones do", "126:08", "you know for the rest of the culture", "126:10", "that might have existed", "126:12", "moving forward and and you know what", "126:14", "they're saying and so and and the", "126:17", "rhetoric around this is so detrimental", "126:19", "because during during that hearing it", "126:22", "was clearly about how do we protect", "126:24", "sacred sites and and how do we make sure", "126:26", "that the tribal consultation and other", "126:30", "options can be presented so that the", "126:35", "environment and other areas are", "126:36", "protected and the Republican congressman", "126:40", "that was there it was really quite seems", "126:46", "like not a nice guy", "126:49", "basically said there is more damage", "126:51", "caused by migrant traffic trash and", "126:58", "defecating then there is by blowing up", "127:02", "the ground and so that is the Department", "127:07", "of the Interior Homeland Security and", "127:09", "and Republicans in Congress are saying", "127:12", "about that border well stop and think", "127:13", "about how that's unchallenged yeah how", "127:15", "ridiculous a thing that is to say you", "127:17", "could pick up trash you can pick up shit", "127:18", "mm-hmm you can't pick up once you blow", "127:20", "up sacred sites yeah it's forever and", "127:23", "it's irreplaceable these are", "127:25", "irreplaceable resources the fact that", "127:27", "nobody challenged him on that like", "127:28", "that's such a ridiculous thing okay we", "127:30", "challenged them and Deb Holland who is", "127:33", "Native American", "127:34", "congresswoman definitely challenged him", "127:38", "about that but you know it's I think the", "127:46", "law is on their side is it safe to say", "127:48", "that there's many areas that you're", "127:51", "talking about along the border that are", "127:53", "probably undiscovered because you're", "127:55", "dealing with things that are potentially", "127:56", "thousands of years old", "127:58", "so remember undiscovered has different", "128:00", "meanings", "128:01", "so tribes may have understandings about", "128:05", "certain areas that other people do not", "128:07", "that they try to protect and so that's", "128:10", "why consultation is so important and", "128:12", "working with tribes so you can", "128:14", "understand what's going on on the ground", "128:16", "but usually they do some kind of minor", "128:23", "investigation and supposedly that was", "128:25", "done", "128:26", "that is being done but nothing's being", "128:32", "done to protect it so it's known but so", "128:34", "even if they consult with the tribes and", "128:38", "the tribe say this is this area is", "128:40", "essentially a burial ground from a", "128:41", "thousand years ago and our ancestors use", "128:43", "this yeah there you go that's cool story", "128:45", "we're gonna put a wall here yep yeah but", "128:49", "that happens that's not just happening", "128:50", "at the border that's happening all over", "128:52", "the United States yeah yeah so and", "128:56", "that's nothing new what's new here is", "128:59", "that all of those environmental laws and", "129:02", "those opportunities for public comments", "129:04", "so it's not just tribal consultation but", "129:06", "even public comment have been completely", "129:09", "waived those stories always weird me out", "129:12", "when someone's building an apartment", "129:13", "building and they stop construction", "129:15", "because they found some sort of a burial", "129:17", "site underneath and you're like right", "129:19", "like how many of those are out there I", "129:21", "mean how many how many areas where", "129:25", "people are digging into the ground they", "129:27", "are gonna find some incredible", "129:30", "archaeological discovery and it's it's", "129:32", "getting you know smashed by a bulldozer", "129:34", "yeah it happens all the time and so a", "129:37", "lot of our a lot of the context for what", "129:42", "was happening here before Europeans came", "129:45", "is gone yeah because we've just", "129:47", "destroyed all the evidence of it hmm", "129:50", "you know so that's why often the way", "129:55", "archaeological investigations have have", "129:58", "moved forward as they look at discrete", "130:00", "sites without connecting the dots in a", "130:06", "more holistic way about what's happened", "130:09", "in a certain area so all most of our", "130:12", "archaeological context and all that", "130:15", "evidence is gone and it continues to be", "130:17", "looted by amateur archaeologists and of", "130:20", "course you know I've worked on many", "130:23", "different developments across the", "130:27", "country where you know the bulldozers", "130:30", "come oh they see there's human remains", "130:31", "there and they just dump it into the", "130:33", "fill really yeah because they don't want", "130:38", "to stop the report", "130:39", "money is stuff yeah across the shell on", "130:41", "them yeah it's amazing to me that", "130:43", "there's some sites that you could just", "130:45", "visit like Buffalo jumps where they ran", "130:48", "by flows off the cliff like a friend of", "130:49", "mine was telling me about this is a site", "130:51", "that you could go to and I'm like you", "130:52", "could just go there he's like yeah you", "130:54", "find Indian

something", "138:47", "you could just gawk at even I mean I", "138:49", "never even thought about looking at", "138:51", "bones that looking at bones would be", "138:53", "disrespectful until I thought about like", "138:56", "Amy Winehouse is head sitting there at a", "138:58", "museum and I'm like yeah every kind of", "139:00", "fucked up yeah yeah yeah that's it is a", "139:05", "it's a it requires a shift in", "139:07", "perspective right and I think that's all", "139:11", "tribal nations are asking people to do", "139:14", "is to think differently about these", "139:17", "issues and and recreate a new and more", "139:22", "appropriate myth about our collective", "139:25", "history and let us decide for ourselves", "139:30", "what we want to share and what we don't", "139:33", "want to share", "139:34", "and I think what you'll find is is as", "139:37", "that Indian nations have shared a lot so", "139:41", "this this work on Native American graves", "139:43", "protection and repatriation act where", "139:45", "those museums thought they were gonna", "139:47", "lose all their collections and their", "139:48", "shelves would be cleaned out and no", "139:50", "exhibits anymore what they found instead", "139:53", "was that they actually figured out what", "139:56", "the hell they've been holding on to this", "139:58", "whole time because now they're actually", "140:00", "talking to the people who who have", "140:04", "experience expertise and cultural", "140:06", "knowledge about these items that are in", "140:08", "their collections so all of a sudden", "140:14", "information that they never had before", "140:16", "and so the relationships that have been", "140:19", "built between museums and those", "140:22", "institutions and tribal nations has has", "140:26", "built something completely different", "140:28", "than nobody had contemplated before just", "140:31", "from talking to Native people and in", "140:34", "understanding what those things are and", "140:37", "where they come from and what should be", "140:39", "shared in and what shouldn't be there's", "140:42", "still a lot of museums holding out", "140:43", "though and usually those are the big", "140:44", "well-funded institutions what is their", "140:48", "what's their argument they don't have an", "140:53", "argument what's interesting is is I", "140:55", "wrote somewhere once that you know we're", "140:58", "just waiting for a lot of old white", "140:59", "people to die I mean that's that yeah", "141:03", "that's really the case that there's just", "141:06", "this old perspective this old philosophy", "141:10", "this hoarding philosophy not wanting to", "141:13", "give things back is also in their", "141:17", "defense could it be that they're really", "141:18", "concerned that that stuff would be lost", "141:20", "and that it is yeah important historical", "141:23", "right and so the the mission of many", "141:26", "museums is to educate the public and", "141:29", "there is this kind of arrogant what I", "141:32", "would consider an arrogant way of", "141:34", "thinking about about the world like", "141:37", "everyone should have access to knowledge", "141:41", "and and and tribes don't necessarily", "141:45", "feel that same way", "141:47", "so there is that kind of that philosophy", "141:52", "and so those institutions will often use", "141:55", "the law to work against the repatriation", "141:59", "situation and delay mostly delay most", "142:05", "tribes that want to fight against", "142:08", "institutions like that because for one", "142:11", "thing they don't have the capacity to", "142:14", "fight that because there are so many", "142:17", "things on their table already and and", "142:19", "another reason to bring that kind of", "142:24", "discord around these sacred items or", "142:28", "around ancestral remains is is difficult", "142:33", "so you don't want to bring you know that", "142:38", "energy around something that you need to", "142:41", "care for and respect and and put back in", "142:44", "the ground so you know there's a lot of", "142:48", "reasons why these bigger institutions", "142:52", "are getting away with not following the", "142:54", "law and they take advantage of it and so", "142:58", "that's why my my organization is", "143:00", "important because we try to help bridge", "143:02", "that it seems like some sort of", "143:06", "cooperative effort could be reached", "143:08", "where the things that the tribes would", "143:12", "like people to see and would like to", "143:15", "educate people on could be displayed and", "143:18", "maybe some sort of a National Museum of", "143:21", "Native American history really that is", "143:24", "an awesome idea so there's this exist", "143:28", "it's called the National Museum of the", "143:30", "American Indian where is it um in", "143:32", "Washington DC it's also yes it's also in", "143:36", "and it's it's got a I'm
