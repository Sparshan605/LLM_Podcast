at", "22:24", "the airport because I feel like it's one", "22:26", "of the rare times where you could just", "22:28", "stare at people while they're doing", "22:29", "their job and no one gets weird with you", "22:31", "because everybody's staring at that guy", "22:33", "or that girl that's taking your license", "22:35", "and scanning your ticket and all that", "22:37", "just I just stare at them and I watch", "22:38", "how they interact with all these people", "22:41", "and people are fucking tired that's what", "22:43", "I see I see I see frustration I see so", "22:46", "many people in these

"bringing shoe bombs or knives on planes", "23:22", "and it's really hard to do", "23:23", "no it is I mean I don't think that the", "23:26", "the the counter point would be to just", "23:29", "get rid of it just right walk into a", "23:30", "terminal and be able to get on an", "23:31", "airplane but I remember you know if you", "23:33", "remember too and a lot of people do we", "23:35", "had the security apparatus before 9/11", "23:37", "these guys outsmarted the security", "23:39", "apparatus by doing very specific things", "23:41", "including like knowing how to fly planes", "23:42",

so then I think well there's", "23:51", "something like over 90% of like agents", "23:53", "that we're trying to get through things", "23:54", "through the TSA succeeded so these are", "23:56", "these

like here's a shit I", "24:13", "know I meet like me too like I go", "24:15", "through I bet just for anything you", "24:16", "might leave in there and yeah I always", "24:17", "come through just make sure there's not", "24:18", "you know you never know what can happen", "24:19", "but to the point you didn't mean to do", "24:21", "that right it really wasn't that it was", "24:23", "there it was yeah yeah yeah it's it's", "24:27", "not a perfect system", "24:28", "and it's not going to be and that's just", "24:30", "the way it is it would be nice if it was", "24:32", "more efficient it would be nice if", "24:33", "people got paid better it'd be nice if", "24:35", "it was easier and quicker there'd be a", "24:36", "lot of it would be nice but I don't know", "24:38", "of anybody that's come up with a better", "24:40", "system for scanning people and making", "24:42", "sure that they don't bring guns or bombs", "24:44", "or whatever the fuck is a German", "24:45", "airplane it's just bizarre that", "24:47", "airplanes are the one place where we", "24:48", "have so much fucking security we're", "24:50", "malls which are filled with way more", "24:52", "people than your average plane there's", "24:54", "something about terror and flying where", "24:57", "it's already terrifying like yeah you", "24:59", "think you're scared now bitch what if it", "25:00", "blows up in the sockets guy dude pulls a", "25:03", "fucking turban out of a bag and wraps", "25:04", "around his head and starts lightness", "25:06", "underwear on fire you know that's that's", "25:08", "what we're

500 miles an hour if it blows", "25:17", "up while you do in that it's even more", "25:19", "freaky oh my god horrifying but you got", "25:20", "weird it's terrifying but like it's kind", "25:23", "of strange whereas like that seems to be", "25:27", "like the preferred method of Terror like", "25:29", "that we're really worried about which is", "25:31", "why the TSA exists in the first place", "25:32", "because the volume of humans that go", "25:36", "through a lot of places is probably", "25:38", "commensurate with the volume of humans", "25:39", "that go through the airport", "25:40", "oh sure you don't have a single place", "25:42", "that you could mention that is strict", "25:45", "with what you carry around as the", "25:47", "airport you could walk into the fucking", "25:49", "mall with a loaded gun any day of the", "25:51", "week any day of the week every single", "25:54", "time I walk on the mall I am just never", "25:57", "checked I know but nobody frisks me I", "25:59", "don't go there any metal detectors you", "26:01", "could walk in armed to the fucking teeth", "26:03", "and that was going tot be the mall", "26:05", "security guard the fuck out of here and", "26:07", "it is a little yeah that's you BAE yeah", "26:09", "like during Christmas time there are", "26:10", "thousands of people at the mall", "26:12", "thousands thousands and thousands yeah I", "26:14", "agree I mean that's it's like it's more", "26:16", "like the Israeli experience where like", "26:17", "this this kind of shit can happen at any", "26:19", "time anyway right a very vigilant about", "26:20", "that I often wonder that as well like", "26:21", "why doesn't even at a security", "26:23", "checkpoint in an airport why not just do", "26:25", "it there yeah like like and I really", "26:27", "think it's that they you know to your", "26:30", "point with the mall and all these kinds", "26:31", "of things and these public places I", "26:33", "think it just speaks to the fact that", "26:34", "most people vast majority people are", "26:35", "just good decent people that want to go", "26:37", "for their lives for sure and that these", "26:38", "terrorists could target all these", "26:40", "different places I don't think they do", "26:41", "maybe because", "26:42", "they camp but probably more because they", "26:43", "don't want to give themselves away for", "26:45", "something that might be seen as minor", "26:47", "like 9/11 was a spectacle wasn't only", "26:50", "that 3,000 some odd people died it was", "26:51", "that it was the spectacle of killing", "26:53", "those people in that way and so I think", "26:55", "that there's something that about that", "26:57", "as well which is why I'm more scared", "26:58", "about like a dirty bomb or something", "27:00", "like that today than I am of anyone", "27:01", "taking an airplane over because everyone", "27:03", "knows what happened in 2001 so now", "27:04", "someone pulled out a knife on an", "27:05", "airplane and try someone's just going to", "27:07", "tackle that guy and probably kill him oh", "27:09", "yeah yeah so I'm not sure that's why and", "27:11", "the guy yeah I know the guy tried to", "27:12", "blow a shoe up or something like that on", "27:13", "the plane that's why we have to take our", "27:14", "fucking shoes off now but yet to me I'm", "27:17", "like the the the threat has changed the", "27:20", "threat is evolving and we can be", "27:22", "vigilant in all these ways but then I", "27:23", "wonder it goes back to like NSA and all", "27:25", "these things like

lot", "64:02", "of shit and that's where it gets really", "64:03", "scary so he was talking about the NSA", "64:06", "looking into people's emails and having", "64:07", "the ability to like I found out about", "64:11", "that NSA whistleblower the original ones", "64:13", "he could find who that guy is I want to", "64:14", "say yes yes pulled it pull it pull up", "64:18", "that article I found out about that from", "64:19", "Alex he told me about I'm like what and", "64:21", "then I hear bill Binney the original NSA", "64:23", "whistleblower on Snowden 9/11 and", "64:25", "illegal
