I do think this is the", "08:51", "greatest", "08:51", "in the world but the problem with that", "08:54", "is is this country was built on an", "08:57", "ideological foundation that I think it", "08:59", "aids in that our ability to be as great", "09:01", "as we are but we live in the world now", "09:04", "where people don't see the necessity for", "09:06", "something that was never predicted that", "09:07", "was never supposed to be seen through", "09:09", "the lens of necessity in the first place", "09:10", "the Second Amendment doesn't give me a", "09:12", "right it preserves something that", "09:14", "already existed but what happens is we", "09:17", "have a culture of people who don't who", "09:18", "look at the second women as a privilege", "09:20", "not a right they look at it as a", "09:22", "privilege so that's why they say well", "09:24", "why do you need that well why do you", "09:25", "need more than 10 rounds why do you need", "09:27", "this why do you need that and I'm like", "09:28", "first of all we're framing the entire", "09:31", "conversation under need when that's not", "09:33", "what the Second Amendment is about it's", "09:35", "a right that I've already had it's a", "09:37", "natural right that I had the moment that", "09:39", "I stepped foot on this earth as a person", "09:41", "the right to self-defense is universal", "09:43", "yeah and the you know people say okay", "09:47", "it's a right but obviously there's a", "09:49", "problem so we have to do something about", "09:51", "it so you're gonna have to give up your", "09:52", "guns this is this is the common", "09:54", "conversation and it's very flippant and", "09:57", "it's not well thought out and there's no", "10:00", "consideration whatsoever to mental", "10:03", "health issues mmm I think this is", "10:05", "purpose I think that's the primary", "10:07", "problem I that's I've been saying this", "10:09", "from the get-go I think it's the primary", "10:11", "problem I think it's a mental health", "10:12", "issue and people say oh that's", "10:14", "simplifying it I don't think it is I", "10:16", "think it's the opposite I think it's", "10:18", "it's ignored yeah look it's a there's", "10:20", "something wrong when you have this many", "10:23", "people on mental health medication and", "10:25", "then when you look at the number of mass", "10:26", "shooters", "10:27", "it's almost universal almost every", "10:30", "single one of them is on some sort of", "10:32", "psychiatric medication but that's not a", "10:34", "part of the narrative that's not a part", "10:36", "of the conversation the conversations", "10:37", "always get rid of guns now I don't want", "10:40", "crazy people to have guns I don't think", "10:42", "you do either no I don't so outside of", "10:47", "taking away the rights to have guns from", "10:50", "normal law-abiding people like yourself", "10:52", "and myself I have guns what what do we", "10:57", "do okay so first of all I think we need", "10:59", "to frame the conversation and into", "11:01", "specifics right you're a lawyer right I", "11:03", "am okay so you understand", "11:05", "and bills and amendments and law okay", "11:08", "yeah and so I think one we're lumping", "11:11", "the entire conversation in one category", "11:13", "right if we're gonna talk about school", "11:16", "shootings let's talk about school", "11:17", "shootings okay right so first thing I", "11:19", "say is because one thing a lot of people", "11:21", "on that side like to say is well you", "11:23", "guys just don't want any any gun laws", "11:25", "and you say no to everything but you", "11:27", "have no so that's true but to to stand", "11:30", "up for that it's because all they want", "11:33", "to do is take away the guns yeah they're", "11:35", "saying let's take away the guns you're", "11:36", "saying we're not gonna take away the", "11:37", "guns you guys just don't want to get", "11:39", "your guns taken away yes you're right", "11:41", "right no one wants to get their guns", "11:42", "take away and inoculate but a monster as", "11:44", "a result of saying exactly you want kids", "11:46", "to die and it's it's a fucking real", "11:48", "sneaky conversation it's disingenuous", "11:49", "yes it is and and that's and that took", "11:52", "the odd thing about it is it's you", "11:55", "anybody who's paying it into the", "11:57", "discourse in a way is happening", "11:58", "especially on social media right anybody", "12:00", "who follows my Twitter my Twitter", "12:01", "account knows this multiple

the same if I", "12:41", "have the same energy that they have", "12:43", "towards me", "12:43", "that's a very good point and so I've", "12:45", "started you know what I mean cuz I can", "12:47", "be incredibly snarky yeah like I can't", "12:50", "and it's partly due because of my", "12:54", "friends they're all assholes just like", "12:58", "all the friends I grew up with I grew up", "12:59", "arguing with a group of guys who when", "13:02", "they were losing it logically they went", "13:04", "to jokes right right it was like a man", "13:07", "right yeah it took me a second to", "13:09", "realize it because I was the one in law", "13:11", "school right I was the one that was", "13:12", "going to law school real all that stuff", "13:14", "so everything I did was focused and", "13:15",

way that I advocate for", "13:32", "the firearms hmm you know because it can", "13:35", "be a little disarming but the disarming", "13:37", "aspect of it could be beneficial because", "13:39", "it causes people to drop their guard a", "13:40", "little bit right and then when you drop", "13:42", "your guard you can take in information", "13:44", "more objectively more so than waiting or",

to", "77:40", "do those things or have the capability", "77:42", "to do those things right so then that", "77:46", "deals with that vast majority of the", "77:48", "violence that we had there focusing that", "77:50", "energy in fixing those communities I", "77:52", "agree with you 100%", "77:53", "and we've talked about this many many", "77:54", "times in the show that I think that if", "77:56",

there is", "78:53", "democratic right but there's no money", "78:55", "there the problem is there's no money's", "78:57", "going somewhere look I mean look at", "78:58", "Chicago it's not enough I

you", "94:23", "could say it's not real censorship but", "94:24", "it is censorship I mean it's it's it's", "94:26", "pretty much what I'm dealing with right", "94:27", "now so for instance right my

there's just a closer there's a", "101:34", "different dynamic involved you know what", "101:36", "I mean it's um it's gonna become more of", "101:39", "an enum because if you compare the", "101:40",

money", "102:25", "isn't everything right money doesn't", "102:27", "care all so you're still gonna have", "102:29", "instances of people who slip through the", "102:31", "cracks", "102:31", "because

think", "103:07", "that's what their point was the point", "103:08", "was that when violence is real and it's", "103:10", "around you all the time yeah it's it", "103:12", "doesn't become this

have", "118:27", "the conversation right you know and I've", "118:29", "done it on my show the only problem is", "118:31", "is it's too easy to ignore it because of", "118:33", "the platform that it's all right you", "118:34", "know you had someone on your show that", "118:36", "made reasonable points like if somebody", "118:38", "wanted to watch you with in some sort of", "118:42", "a debate with

the thing though so one of", "118:53", "the biggest flaws of the people that", "118:54", "were on my show that would I had that", "118:56", "conversation with is you could instantly", "118:59", "see it was more of an education process", "119:02", "because you could tell they didn't know", "119:03", "much so what would happen is that they'd", "119:05", "make a point about why they believe this",

take", "119:40", "away from this is that this is a it's a", "119:43", "messy situation it's not clean it's not", "119:47", "like hey we're putting poison in the", "119:49", "water", "119:50", "stop putting poison in the water clean", "119:52", "up the water it is not that simple", "119:54", "super complicated it deals with mental", "119:57", "health it deals with freedom and it", "119:59",
