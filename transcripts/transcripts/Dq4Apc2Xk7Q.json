these", "01:58", "films because they are trying to convert", "02:02", "people to being vegan and they think", "02:06", "that distorting reality and just bending", "02:10", "things and cherry-picking

was an", "05:45", "insult it wasn't you know a compliment", "05:48", "it was like haha you can you only can", "05:51", "afford to eat barley yeah so yeah I was", "05:54", "a bizarre way to start the film I", "05:55", "thought there could have been better", "05:57", "ways to do it and let me also just say", "05:59", "like if this film if the purpose of this", "06:03", "film was to say it's

some actual data to go with that", "07:20", "where they showed studies right I mean", "07:22", "we have James talking about his ability", "07:25", "to do the battle ropes but all of a", "07:26",

he's", "07:42", "an amazing athlete was a great fighter", "07:43", "he's got fantastic endurance is", "07:45", "excellent martial arts technique I would", "07:48", "just buy it at face level or at face", "07:51", "value but there's a lot of those there's", "07:54", "a lot and then I mean we can go through", "07:56", "it and talk about I mean there's that", "07:59", "problem which is there's no", "08:00", "peer-reviewed evidence to back that up", "08:01", "but even the anecdotal evidence is a", "08:03", "little shaky is when we start to talk", "08:05", "about some of the athletes in the film", "08:07", "and there are also examples of athletes", "08:09", "outside of the film who you know switch", "08:12", "to a vegan diet and we look and see what", "08:14", "happened to them after they did that the", "08:16", "problem here is something that I call", "08:19", "the vegan honeymoon which is you know", "08:22", "you take someone who's been on a", "08:24", "standard American diet they're eating", "08:25", "KFC McDonald's etc and they switched", "08:28", "from that to a plant-based diet well of", "08:30", "course they're gonna feel better they've", "08:31", "gone from eating absolute crap to real", "08:34", "foods yes and so for a period of time", "08:37", "they're going to feel better for sure", "08:38", "but then what happens over a longer", "08:42", "period of time you know so I'm not", "08:45", "getting enough protein just in terms of", "08:47", "quantity and not getting the right", "08:49", "quality of protein that starts", "08:51", "have an impact micronutrient", "08:53", "deficiencies you know", "08:54", "vitamin A zinc calcium iron things like", "08:57", "that take a while to develop so you're", "08:59", "not going to see that decline in", "09:01",

"09:08", "status going into it the type of", "09:10", "exercise and activity that they're doing", "09:12", "the way they're implementing the diet", "09:14", "etc so you have to not just look at what", "09:17", "happens a month after someone goes vegan", "09:19", "you have to look at what happens six", "09:21", "months a year after or two years after", "09:23", "and we can look at specific examples of", "09:25", "that so in the absence of the correct", "09:28", "amount of amino acids a correct amount", "09:30", "of specific nutrients you start to see a", "09:33", "slow decline right so and this is", "09:35", "something that they're not taking into", "09:37", "account yeah one of the things they", "09:39", "talked about was protein content and I", "09:41", "immediately knew that this was not", "09:42", "correct or that they're being deceptive", "09:44", "they were talking about three ounces of", "09:45", "steak versus what are they compared", "09:48", "peanut butter sandwich and maybe some", "09:49", "lentils is that what it was oh boy well", "09:51", "the problem is the amino acid profile of", "09:54", "that steak is far superior the amount of", "09:56", "protein that your body absorbs is far", "09:59", "superior it's said that you're talking", "10:01", "about a completely different thing this", "10:03", "is known science you can get as many", "10:06", "amino acids from plant-based proteins", "10:10", "but you Edin need to eat a higher", "10:12", "quantity you know right that's that's", "10:14", "what's important not the overall grams", "10:16", "of protein it's the quality of the", "10:18", "protein what's the amino acid of the", "10:20", "profile of the protein and how does your", "10:22", "body absorb it again this does not mean", "10:23", "like I'm a giant fan of hemp protein I", "10:25", "eat that stuff all the time it's great", "10:28", "it's just you can't say that protein", "10:32", "grams are equal to protein grams because", "10:34", "they're not no but it's even worse than", "10:37", "that Jamie pull-ups live for if you can", "10:39", "there's I made some graphics here", "10:41", "because it's sometimes easier to", "10:43", "understand when you're looking at a", "10:44", "picture so for the peanut butter", "10:48", "sandwich thing it was like there's a", "10:49", "there's the same amount of protein in a", "10:51", "peanut butter sandwiches there is in", "10:53", "three ounces of beef so I looked up the", "10:55", "data of course", "10:56", "so three ounces of 90 percent lean", "10:58", "ground beef has 24 grams of protein you", "11:00", "get two slices of wheat bread will give", "11:03", "them the benefit of the", "11:04", "that it's whole-wheat not white bread", "11:05", "that's 5 grams 1 tablespoon of peanut", "11:09", "butter is 4 grams so you'd have to have", "11:11", "5 tablespoons of peanut butter in that", "11:13", "sandwich to equal 3 ounces of beef", "11:16", "that's 1/3 of a cup of peanut butter", "11:18", "it's a lot of fun you ever made a peanut", "11:20", "butter sandwich with 1/3 cup of you've", "11:22", "probably have but I'm a glutton and", "11:28", "that's 600 calories yeah versus 200", "11:31", "calories from the ground beef for the", "11:33", "just for the same amount same routine", "11:35", "just quantity I'm not even getting into", "11:37", "quality and I'm gonna get into that in", "11:38", "fact we're just talking about quantity", "11:40", "approach but I think they were saying", "11:42", "peanut butter sandwich and a cup of", "11:43", "lentils right wasn't the combined no I", "11:46", "think they said 3 or or a cup of lentils", "11:50", "or was more yeah so would plus a couple", "11:57", "of yeah yeah then as you pointed out", "12:00", "it's all about protein quality and this", "12:02", "as you said this is an established", "12:04", "science firmly established science they", "12:06", "look at this especially like in third", "12:08", "world countries where protein deficiency", "12:10", "is common so to try to figure out how to", "12:12", "address that what are the highest", "12:14", "quality proteins that we can feed these", "12:17", "people to bring them up to where they", "12:19", "should be in terms of protein intake so", "12:21", "the the most recent scale that's used is", "12:23", "called Adeus digestible indispensable", "12:26", "amino acid score so it ranks proteins", "12:29", "according to two main categories one is", "12:32", "the amino acid profile and as you", "12:34", "mentioned when it comes to protein", "12:36", "quality it's not just does the protein", "12:39", "have every amino acid you know this is", "12:41", "what's a little disingenuous about the", "12:43", "film they said every plant protein has", "12:46", "every amino acid well yeah nobody it", "12:49", "disagrees with that but does it have", "12:50", "enough of each of them that's the key", "12:52", "question what's the quantity what's the", "12:54", "profile so the DIA slicks an amino acid", "12:57", "profile but then it also looks at", "12:59", "bioavailability protein is not worth", "13:01", "worth much if you can't actually digest", "13:03", "and absorb it so it's a complex you know", "13:06", "algorithm that combines all those things", "13:08", "and that ranks the proteins on a scale", "13:10", "so the Dia's for beef rare beef is 1.3 9", "13:15", "it's among the highest scores on the", "13:17", "whole scale the Dia's for egg is 1.13", "13:22", "for peanut butter at 0.45 and for wheat", "13:25", "at 0.2 those are among the lowest", "13:28", "proteins there that have been measured", "13:30", "on the scale so even if the quantity was", "13:33", "the same the effect on your body", "13:36", "particularly on things like muscle", "13:38", "protein synthesis which is of concern", "13:40", "you know for athletes is not even in the", "13:42", "same ballpark and when they're talking", "13:45", "about the u.s. RDA they're talking about", "13:48", "like how much you know the United States", "13:50", "recommended daily allowances that is", "13:53", "isn't that just to be healthy like to be", "13:56", "a lot unhealthy but to be alive there's", "13:58", "being a lot more accurate it's the avoid", "13:59", "it's the amount that's required to avoid", "14:02", "malnutrition right and clean so thanks I", "14:04", "know that yeah right so I'm you know why", "14:07", "don't they know that I'm not doing any", "14:09", "documentaries on food why don't they", "14:11", "know that seems like so - use that as a", "14:13", "reference point to use that as like look", "14:15", "you can get this that's plenty that's", "14:17", "crazy well that's a common argument in", "14:19", "the vegan community and they you know I", "14:21", "don't know whether it's because they", "14:23", "they really don't understand the science", "14:25", "behind it or because they do and they're", "14:28", "just you know it's being kind of", "14:30", "exaggerated to suit the their claim I", "14:34", "can't know that you know this is what I", "14:36", "think it is honestly there's a lot of", "14:38", "vegan influencers and there's a lot of", "14:39", "people that make youtube videos and", "14:40", "people who produce things like this and", "14:43", "then the other folks just parrot what", "14:46", "they say right so

films like a debunking of", "14:59", "one of these films will get way less", "15:01", "views right then the actual film itself", "15:04", "that's just how it goes nobody's gonna", "15:05", "watch and so especially the people that", "15:07", "already convinced for them it's like", "15:09", "excellent I knew Jesus was real now I've", "15:12", "got the proof you know I mean it's", "15:13", "really like that it becomes the ideology", "15:17", "becomes so strong it becomes like a", "15:18", "religion and look I've been accused of", "15:20", "it from doing it from a meat perspective", "15:22", "I understand I understand that you would", "15:24", "think that if you had an opposing vegan", "15:26", "or vegetarian perspective like I totally", "15:28", "understand but man", "15:31", "you know we'd be sorry for that with a", "15:32", "joke on discussion and you see it on", "15:35", "almost every time someone who's actually", "15:37", "informed has a conversation with one of", "15:41", "these influencers like they're not being", "15:43", "a hundred percent accurate objective or", "15:47", "even honest in a lot of cases yeah I", "15:49", "mean there's a great Leon Festinger", "15:51", "quote I know if you've heard it a man", "15:54", "with conviction is a hard man to change", "15:55", "tell him you disagree and he turns away", "15:57", "show him the facts and figures any", "15:59",

gets very", "16:28", "frustrating for me it was like if you", "16:30", "want to make an argument that you should", "16:32", "probably follow a more complicated diet", "16:36", "more complicated meaning that it's more", "16:38", "difficult for you to acquire in some", "16:40", "cities you have to be a little bit more", "16:42", "careful about getting supplementation", "16:43", "with vitamin

a little more complicated", "16:53", "and if you want to say I want to live", "16:55", "like that because the way I feel about", "16:58", "eating animals makes me feel terrible I", "17:00", "don't want to have any part of that and", "17:01", "I found out that I can not have a part", "17:04", "of that and I can live my life that's", "17:05", "great but that's not what they're saying", "17:07", "no and there's a lot of problems with", "17:09", "that argument too I want to come back", "17:11", "and spend some chew on that but I don't", "17:13", "do it right now before we move on", "17:14",

"24:31", "thing here's what they did Joe so that", "24:32", "the number in this specific number in", "24:35", "the film they say greenhouse gas", "24:37", "emissions from Callao or 15 percent and", "24:40", "that and they compared that to 14", "24:42", "percent for all of transportation but", "24:44", "the problem with that is that they're", "24:47", "using the full lifecycle analysis for",

versus just the direct", "25:43", "emissions for transportation well if we", "25:46", "look at just the direct for both it's 5%", "25:49", "for livestock globally and 14% for", "25:52",

"26:10", "because they've heard those numbers", "26:11", "before but the devil is always in the", "26:13", "details well what's going on is what", "26:15", "what you see in a lot of these videos", "26:17", "where only one person gets to talk right", "26:20", "one person who has a specific agenda", "26:22", "gets to cherry-pick the data and distort", "26:24", "it and then put it on the filming

do that and I think that", "26:44", "when when it's all said and done I I", "26:48", "would just like people to be informed", "26:50", "and your everyone is going to have their", "26:54", "own

it's it's not the health aspects", "27:20", "are not being represented accurately", "27:22", "yeah it particularly bothers me when", "27:26", "kids are involved oh it was another", "27:28", "there was a case recently where I was", "27:30", "gonna tweet it but I was like god damn I", "27:32", "can't even tweet it so sad where a child", "27:34", "had died from malnutrition yeah because", "27:36", "the parents were feeding in a vegan diet", "27:38", "and all the other kids look like they", "27:39", "were starving to death too and then the", "27:41", "you know social workers came in and", "27:43", "thought it's a goddamn nightmare and you", "27:45", "don't hear I mean if you hear about that", "27:47", "from people that are starving their kids", "27:49", "on a regular diet they're just either", "27:51", "extremely poor or they're monsters and", "27:54", "they're treating their kid terribly", "27:55", "these people don't seem like they're bad", "27:58", "people know that's recipe areas you", "28:00", "believe in what they're doing they're", "28:01", "trying to do the right thing that's the", "28:02", "scariest part about it is like you're", "28:04", "seeing that this does diet again you can", "28:07", "do it correctly but it's fucking", "28:09", "complicated it's hard yeah just one more", "28:12", "thing on the greenhouse gas questioned", "28:14", "all the numbers I just gave you were", "28:16", "from conventional methods", "28:18", "you know like basically CAFO beef when", "28:25", "they have looked at regenerative", "28:27", "holistically managed livestock they", "28:30", "found that it can either be carbon", "28:31", "neutral or even a carbon sink so there's", "28:33", "a guy who's written some papers on this", "28:35", "Richard Teague and in his 2018 paper", "28:39", "which again you can find on my website", "28:40", "the crusted CEO slash game-changers", "28:43", "he found that these larger more complex", "28:47", "holistically manage sites can sequester", "28:49", "between 3 to", "28:51", "four and even up to seven tons of carbon", "28:54", "per hectare per year", "28:55", "so these holistically managed beef", "28:58", "operations are actually removing carbon", "29:01", "from the outside an a chiral biogenic", "29:11", "cycle and the difference and this is", "29:14", "important to understand is the", "29:15", "difference between transportation which", "29:18", "is basically taking out fossil fuels", "29:20", "that have not been part of that natural", "29:21", "cycle for millions of years and then", "29:24", "just emitting them into the atmosphere", "29:26", "with the carbon the the biogenic carbon", "29:29", "cycle you have methane you know cows are", "29:32", "burping out methane methane goes up into", "29:36", "the atmosphere and then via hydroxyl", "29:39", "oxidation it's converted into co2 and", "29:43", "water vapor then the plants take in co2", "29:46", "and by and then by a photosynthesis they", "29:48", "convert it into food basically", "29:51", "and then the cows eat the food and the", "29:55", "whole cycle keeps going and this is this", "29:58", "is a natural cycle this is not something", "29:59", "you have to use equipment - the natural", "30:01", "cycle so it just has to be a certain", "30:03", "amount of plant life and in their area", "30:05", "and so the way that I mean like Joel", "30:08", "Salatin for example from Polyface farms", "30:10", "and and savory Institute they basically", "30:13", "educate farmers on how to rotate their", "30:17", "livestock again this is not my area of", "30:20", "expertise but rather than just having", "30:21", "the cattle stay in the same place the", "30:24", "whole time like in a feedlot they're", "30:26", "moving the cattle around the cattle are", "30:29", "pooping then they bring the chickens to", "30:32", "where that was you know where the cattle", "30:34", "were and they they move it around in a", "30:36", "way again that I don't fully understand", "30:39", "but the effect of this is that the", "30:42", "amount of carbon that is sequestered", "30:44", "from the atmosphere is greater than the", "30:48", "amount of co2 that is emitted and this", "30:52", "these life cycle analyses have been done", "30:54", "and published in the literature it's", "30:56", "true that right now that type of", "30:59", "holistically managed livestock is not", "31:02", "very common but that doesn't mean that", "31:04", "it's", "31:04", "what we should be doing and you know", "31:07", "this is the thing like with the film I", "31:09", "agree with the problem that they you", "31:11", "know the premise which is that the", "31:13", "feedlot beef production is a nightmare", "31:15", "you know if it can be bad for the", "31:18", "environment and we have to do something", "31:20", "about it where we disagree is what the", "31:22", "solution is yeah you know they go to a", "31:24", "plant-based diet or fake meat or lab", "31:26", "meat I go to regenerative holistically", "31:29", "managed livestock okay so this animal", "31:35", "product like the the regenerative", "31:38", "livestock production doing it in this", "31:40", "method is that sufficient to feed", "31:42", "everyone the production I mean how much", "31:45", "land do you need to do something like", "31:47", "this so I and you're gonna ask that", "31:49", "question and I talk to savory Institute", "31:53", "about this and a few other people and", "31:56", "basically one response is it's the only", "32:00", "way we're gonna feed everybody because", "32:02", "as I mentioned they're only 60 harvests", "32:04", "left because of soil degradation so", "32:07", "continually you know trying to scale up", "32:10", "industrial plant agriculture with soy", "32:13", "and corn and and all of these kinds of", "32:15", "crops is going to further degrade the", "32:17", "soil and at some point we're not gonna", "32:20", "have any soil F Texas doctor right we", "32:23", "should talk about this that you need", "32:24", "compost and you need fertilizer and you", "32:26", "need something that replenishes the soil", "32:29", "and doing these large-scale monoculture", "32:33", "crops when you have these enormous areas", "32:36", "they're just depleting right they're", "32:38", "just pulling and then they have to add", "32:39", "you can't add something for nothing", "32:41", "that's the thing we're not just we're", "32:43", "not choosing between like you know to", "32:47", "one really good alternative in one", "32:49", "terrible alternative that's not a choice", "32:51", "like never seen before if it show like", "32:53", "that's not even a choice you just do you", "32:55", "just obviously do the right thing we're", "32:57", "choosing", "32:57", "it's like on the one hand if we try to", "32:59", "scale up plant agriculture in an", "33:01", "environment where according to the FAO", "33:03", "our soils are in only quote fair poor or", "33:08", "very poor condition and we only have 60", "33:11", "harvests last left due to rapidly", "33:13", "deteriorating soil due to erosion and", "33:16", "nutrient depletion", "33:17", "then we desperately need new methods of",

to", "33:28", "be possible then that may be the only", "33:30", "way we can feed everybody so we would", "33:33", "need to almost have a reversal if that", "33:36", "was the case and have more animal", "33:39", "agriculture than plant agriculture but", "33:41", "not the way it's being done now right it", "33:43", "would have a fee so they would have to", "33:45", "be like Joel Salatin setup yeah so we're", "33:49", "probably Facebook need three things to", "33:51", "happen one would be we'd need to return", "33:53", "all the crop lands that are being used", "33:55", "to feed livestock and feed Lots right", "33:58", "now to grassland and number two we need", "34:01", "to put all unused land like the rocky", "34:04", "hilly soil that are or land that can't", "34:07", "be used for plant agriculture into", "34:09", "production for with animals and number", "34:12", "three farmer farmers and ranchers would", "34:15", "need to adopt regenerative practices you", "34:18", "know so I'm not saying this is an", "34:20", "enormous undertaking", "34:21", "you're not we're talking but so is", "34:23", "feeding the world with plant based", "34:25", "agriculture but whichever direction we", "34:27", "go we're talking about saying you know", "34:30", "really systemic change that needs to", "34:32", "happen in a big way what percent that", "34:35", "this would have you'd have to have all", "34:37", "of the meat be grass-fed meat because", "34:39", "they would be eating what they naturally", "34:41", "eat now", "34:42", "what is the percentage of grass-fed meat", "34:44", "in this country currently I don't know", "34:46", "for sure I think the number I read was", "34:49", "something like two or three percent so", "34:50", "very low very small yeah yeah that makes", "34:53", "sense", "34:54", "many many people prefer grain-fed meat", "34:57", "they like it fatty and sloppy no I mean", "35:00", "that's what it is right a lot of people", "35:01", "like that remark well what's interesting", "35:03", "and I didn't even know this until a few", "35:07", "years ago even fact you know feedlot", "35:10", "meat is mostly grass-fed it's just what", "35:12", "happens in the last like five or ten", "35:14", "percent of the process so it's like 90", "35:19", "percent grass-fed and then it's grain", "35:21", "finished and that grain finishing gives", "35:22", "it the marbling that what you're talking", "35:24", "about what makes the I'm sick", "35:27", "I mean that's really they're not", "35:28", "supposed to eat that really that's what", "35:29", "it is and we've gotten addicted to", "35:31", "animals eating things they're not", "35:32", "supposed to eat and the way their flesh", "35:34", "comes out yeah I mean eighty a lot of", "35:37", "that is that you're eating things like", "35:38", "soy cakes you know they which is a", "35:41", "byproduct of soybean oil production", "35:44", "soybean oil consumption has grown like a", "35:46", "thousandfold in the past hundred and", "35:48", "twenty years it's now the the number one", "35:51", "edible oil that we eat because if you go", "35:53", "into the supermarket and you look at any", "35:55", "food label

obvious if", "44:05", "you ask a hundred people on the street", "44:07", "my guess is a hundred percent would say", "44:09", "those are obviously different yes but", "44:11", "the way that research

just", "44:50", "looking at the general population that", "44:52", "eats meat they tried to find ways to", "44:53", "like at least choose a slightly", "44:57", "healthier omnivorous population so there", "44:59", "was one the health food shoppers study", "45:01", "where they they only looked at people", "45:03", "who shopped at health food stores", "45:04", "thinking ok these people are at least", "45:06", "thinking about it a little bit you know", "45:08", "it's it's still not controlling for all", "45:10", "the factors but they're saying let's", "45:12", "look at people who shop at a place like", "45:14", "Whole Foods and then let's look at the", "45:15", "like compare life span between", "45:17", "vegetarians and vegans and omnivores", "45:19", "well guess what they both both

people without me", "45:39", "look no poison I mean this is but what", "45:41", "about all the other shit yeah this is", "45:42", "what's so crazy about it like how can", "45:44", "you have a study where you don't take", "45:46", "into account how many people drink or", "45:47", "smoke yeah and you just had the meat", "45:49", "it's it's insanity it's that's the", "45:52", "healthy user bias and yeah this is the", "45:54", "the problem and what makes my job so", "45:57", "difficult is like people have heard that", "45:59", "mean is bad for 50 what 60 years you", "46:03", "know so someone can say meat is bad", "46:05", "that's three words and for me to unpack", "46:08", "that I have to talk about healthy user", "46:10", "bias I have to talk about problems with", "46:12", "data collection

is a very strange", "46:37", "time when it comes to information", "46:39", "because so much of it is available but", "46:41", "almost too much and then when you", "46:42", "realize when you start

you're vegan", "47:21", "you go on YouTube you're gonna see ton", "47:23", "of vegan videos and vegan perspective", "47:25", "same with your Facebook feed etc and to", "47:28", "be fair it's the same for you know", "47:29", "people who are into keto or low carb or", "47:31", "carnivore or whatever they're into it's", "47:33", "it's the same thing yeah you're just", "47:35", "getting this

adult", "53:42", "that weighs less than 130 pounds really", "53:46", "so the sorry that you know how he said", "53:51", "and James said in the study the average", "53:54", "vegetarian gets 71 grams a day which is", "53:57", "not only you know the RDA but 70 percent", "53:59", "more that's using the zero point eight", "54:01", "number but if you use one point two", "54:03", "grams per kilogram per day then a lot of", "54:07", "people are going to be protein deficient", "54:08", "on a vegetarian diet and we're not again", "54:12", "not talking about optimal amount for", "54:13", "athletes we're just talking about the", "54:15", "RDA basic bare minimum and when you say", "54:17", "vegetarian you should say vegan crap", "54:19", "because you're not talking about egg", "54:20", "protein you can get no this study was", "54:22", "vegetarian they weren't referring to", "54:24", "vegans so you actually could get egg", "54:26", "protein and dairy", "54:29", "right protein eggs are a far superior in", "54:32", "terms of their amino acids well than", "54:34", "vegetables yeah so for vegans it would", "54:36", "be different friend of mine I was saying", "54:40", "this really recently why don't you try", "54:42", "eggs and they look to me like I was", "54:45", "talking them about poison yeah like", "54:46", "people there's plenty of people that are", "54:48", "vegan or vegetarian and you bring up", "54:50", "eggs to them they look you like why", "54:52", "would I eat an egg yeah so so that's you", "54:55", "know one point two is the RDA with if", "54:57", "you use this newer method but for", "55:00", "athletes it James to his credit does", "55:03", "acknowledge in the film that athletes", "55:05", "need more protein than than regular non", "55:08", "athlete people but he doesn't say how", "55:10", "much more so again if you use these IAO", "55:14", "method they've done the use this newer", "55:16", "technique to look at athletes and they", "55:18", "found that the range is somewhere", "55:20", "between 1.4 to 2.7 grams per kilogram so", "55:23", "we're now way higher than that 0.8", "55:26", "number", "55:27", "and just for people who aren't familiar", "55:29", "with kilograms let's say we take the", "55:30", "median number they're 2.1 grams per", "55:32", "kilogram per day well anyone who's ever", "55:35", "been in the bodybuilding weightlifting", "55:36",

like that's", "56:00", "that's that it turns out that's actually", "56:03", "based on science you know so a 200 pound", "56:07", "athlete we need 200 grams of protein a", "56:09", "day and Jamie if

of those like the", "56:45", "bioavailability and the amino acid", "56:47", "profile would be horrible compared to", "56:50", "meat eggs dairy so what would I have to", "56:54", "do cuz then I know they've done this", "56:55", "studying there was a study that I'd read", "56:57", "or had heard about I should say where", "57:01", "they compared rice protein to whey", "57:04", "protein and they found that at a certain", "57:07", "level of grams like whatever it was they", "57:11", "had an equal effect is it lutein leucine", "57:14", "leucine the muscle protein synthesis", "57:16", "yeah they had an equal effect I should", "57:18", "give credit to the video that I was", "57:20", "watching some gentleman I was watching", "57:23", "this video today dr. Ryan Lowry and that", "57:28", "they were saying that what that means is", "57:30", "that correct me if I'm wrong what it is", "57:33", "is when you get it once you hit a", "57:35", "certain level of leucine it's a point of", "57:38", "diminishing returns and there's no", "57:39", "there's no added", "57:40", "benefit to having more leucine in your", "57:43", "diet so if you hit whatever it is I", "57:44", "think it's 48 grams or something that if", "57:47", "when you have 48 grams of this and 48", "57:49", "grams of that you put the two of them", "57:51", "together it's essentially the same this", "57:54", "the same effect well I'm not sure about", "57:58", "that but I mean leucine is very", "58:00", "important for anabolic signaling and", "58:02", "muscle protein synthesis it's it's one", "58:05", "of the essential it's the essential", "58:06", "amino acid that's thought to be the most", "58:08", "important for that and it's it's low in", "58:10", "plant proteins and the other issue with", "58:15", "plant proteins that you have is that", "58:17", "they have limiting amino acids so these", "58:19", "are amino acids that actually interfere", "58:21", "with muscle protein synthesis so because", "58:24", "the levels are so low in that food so", "58:26", "lysine is a limiting amino acid and", "58:28", "grains like wheat and rice maybe that's", "58:30", "there was leucine and lysine discussion", "58:33", "may be there may be and then methionine", "58:35", "and cysteine are limiting in legumes", "58:37", "like soy so Jaime at slide six I made a", "58:41", "chart comparing the amino acid profile", "58:43", "on beef to several different plant", "58:45", "proteins like white beans soy beans peas", "58:47", "and rice what you can see there is beef", "58:52", "is higher in every single amino acid", "58:57", "other than then every plant protein", "59:00", "that's compared there with the exception", "59:01", "of soybeans are slightly higher in", "59:05",

higher and leucine than any other", "59:19", "plant protein which is why it's often", "59:22", "used and then like zero point three four", "59:24", "peas and 0.01 for rice if you get to a", "59:28",

"59:38", "by eating cooked peas or soybeans it is", "59:41", "possible or sure so I an enormous amount", "59:45", "of that as you can see because of the", "59:47", "levels and this is why a lot of vegan", "59:49", "bodybuilders and athletes end up using", "59:51", "protein powders because you can get to", "59:54", "the", "59:54", "amounts easier by using the powders and", "59:57", "you can also blend like a you know 70% P", "60:01", "with 30% rice to get the right amino", "60:04", "acid ratio easier with powders so like", "60:08", "Patrick Babu Mian is a good example of", "60:10", "that you know did you see the video that", "60:12", "Bobby got Geist made no of his oh so", "60:16", "there's actually videos that the one", "60:18", "that you sent me yes I did see there's", "60:20", "video that Patrick made himself of his", "60:22", "own diet yes on you know what he eats on", "60:26", "a daily basis and it turns out to be a", "60:28", "boatload of protein powder and just", "60:31", "shakes with all kinds of powders and", "60:33", "supplements and things like that yeah so", "60:35", "yeah we can go through it so he starts", "60:38", "with a bunch of different supplements in", "60:39", "the morning multivitamin nutritional", "60:41", "yeast seeing glucosamine magnesium", "60:43", "calcium b12 and iron then he has a", "60:46", "protein shake with soy protein powder", "60:49", "creatine and beta-alanine which probably", "60:51", "is because he's aware of the research", "60:53", "showing lower levels of muscle creatine", "60:55", "and carnosine and in vegans beta alanine", "60:59", "and creatine would address that then he", "61:02", "has a post-workout smoothie with soy or", "61:04", "P protein powder glutamine beta alanine", "61:07", "creatine and dried greens and then his", "61:09", "first solid meal of the day is fried", "61:12", "falafel french fries soy sausage fried", "61:15", "peppers and tomatoes and then he has", "61:19", "some more protein shakes and smoothies", "61:21", "throughout the day so I don't know that", "61:23", "doesn't strike me as a super healthy way", "61:26", "to eat what what do you what problem do", "61:28", "you have that well first of all I think", "61:31", "we should primarily get nutrients from", "61:32", "food whenever we can I'm not against", "61:35", "supplementation I think there's a role", "61:37", "for it of course like you know", "61:38", "especially with things like vitamin D", "61:40", "that you might not be able to get enough", "61:41", "of from food or therapeutic", "61:43", "supplementation if you're dealing with a", "61:45", "health problem but like getting them", "61:47", "like eating a diet that is not", "61:49", "sufficient in the amount of nutrients", "61:52", "that you need and then using supplements", "61:53", "to make up you know to to address that", "61:56", "doesn't make a lot of sense to me well", "61:58", "in his situation he's got a very unique", "62:00", "situation that he's a he's a strength", "62:03", "athlete that's all he's doing is trying", "62:05", "to lift really really heavy things so he", "62:07", "needs to maintain", "62:08", "a certain amount of bulk yes I have an", "62:10", "enormous amount of protein yeah a normal", "62:12", "protein has to be he's very heavy you", "62:15", "know and that that sport is also that's", "62:20", "a steroid sport I mean it's just one of", "62:22", "those sports where it's like", "62:23", "bodybuilding much everybody steroid", "62:25", "sport so you're eating massive amounts", "62:28", "of quantities you're taking chemicals", "62:29", "yeah it might not be the healthiest", "62:32", "thing but it's also like just the sport", "62:35", "itself might not be the healthiest thing", "62:37", "I mean you've seen them carry people on", "62:39", "the yo he was doing that in the gym yeah", "62:40", "that's not good for your back but it", "62:46", "works for what he's trying to do nicely", "62:49", "it's working for what he's trying it", "62:50", "does there's no dispute in that see what", "62:52", "he's doing is almost like the", "62:54", "intelligent way if you want to be vegan", "62:56", "and do what he's trying to do right I", "62:58", "don't know if he could eat just", "63:00", "vegetables and pull that off you", "63:02", "couldn't but that's kind of the point", "63:04", "there are a lot of other strong men that", "63:05", "do just like Robert Oberst you had on", "63:08", "the show John's meat and rice right yeah", "63:11", "its pounds of beef and rice simple you", "63:15", "know accessible form of carbohydrate and", "63:17", "a lot of protein and it's an unfair", "63:19", "comparison and Oberst talked about him", "63:21", "on the podcast before there much law", "63:22", "he's much larger a lot of the strongmen", "63:24", "not huge like the guy who played Gregor", "63:33", "and Patrick is not these are not nearly", "63:36", "that time five six or five seven things", "63:38", "so the comparison between him and a guy", "63:42", "like Oberst in those legit top of the", "63:44", "food chain strongest man in the world", "63:46", "competitions it's not it's not a", "63:48", "completely different weight class he's", "63:50", "you know Robert is enormous he's so much", "63:53", "bigger but the problem is in the film", "63:56", "they don't make that distinction and", "63:58", "they try to pretend that this guy is one", "63:59", "of the strongest men in the world he's", "64:02", "not he's very strong no doubt and he", "64:05", "definitely has broken some records in", "64:07", "some competitions and you know and you", "64:09", "have different weight classes and", "64:11", "different but you're not talking about a", "64:13", "guy who wins those you know Magnus von", "64:16", "Magnus and fucking competitions where", "64:17", "they're carrying trucks and shit well I", "64:20", "mean", "64:21", "my point to was like is it the best", "64:23", "example of how an athlete can thrive on", "64:25", "a plant-based Whole Foods diet I think", "64:28", "it is though because for him", "64:29", "for his size you know for it to be a guy", "64:32", "who's five foot seven and is carrying", "64:34", "that fucking enormous amount of weight", "64:35", "he's obviously doing something that's", "64:37", "very impressive and he's doing it while", "64:39", "he's on this vegan diet and again I mean", "64:41", "just discounting all the illegal", "64:45", "supplementation because I don't think it", "64:46", "is illegal in that sport it's kind you", "64:49", "kind of have to do it would you want to", "64:50", "get that big the but if you want to do", "64:53", "it and do it as a vegan he is showing", "64:55", "you that it's possible so in that sense", "64:57", "I defend what he's doing because I think", "64:59", "that he like that's the only way in that", "65:01", "but this is a very sports specific area", "65:04", "of performance he's just talking about", "65:06", "lifting insanely heavy shit and he's", "65:09", "doing that and thriving on a vegan diet", "65:11", "yeah no doubt", "65:13", "you know enormous Lee strong and he's", "65:15", "succeeding I would argue that he might", "65:19", "do even better if he was eating meat you", "65:22", "know nutrient-dense nutrition a suit and", "65:24", "he might need to take fewer supplements", "65:26", "and drink less powder yeah but I think", "65:29", "that's my bias I'm more like a Whole", "65:32", "Foods person and you know that's where", "65:34", "I'm coming from another problem that I", "65:36", "had in the film especially in relations", "65:38", "to sport is the Nate Diaz Conor McGregor", "65:40", "comparison yeah first of all Nate Diaz", "65:43", "is not a vegan Nate Diaz eats fish and", "65:44", "he eats eggs yeah and he he does try to", "65:48", "follow a whole food vegan diet I think", "65:52", "during camp so I would have to talk to", "65:55", "him about that I know he's done", "65:56", "interviews talking about that but I've", "65:58", "definitely seen him eat fish I watched", "66:00", "him on the Anthony Bourdain's television", "66:02", "show and he was eating fish I know he's", "66:04", "eating eggs he doesn't eat land animals", "66:06", "I think what he does is avoids red meat", "66:09", "well fish and eggs take care of it yeah", "66:11", "you know fish is actually higher often", "66:14", "and than meat in terms of protein counts", "66:17", "per ounce it's also very high in", "66:18", "collagen which is super important for", "66:20", "recovery and repair and explains lack of", "66:23", "collagen probably explains why a lot of", "66:25", "vegan athletes get injured which we can", "66:26", "talk about more later and then eggs as", "66:29", "you know are super you know they're", "66:31", "really high on the Dia's score scale", "66:34", "bio-available lots of other nutrients so", "66:36", "here's another problem with that whole", "66:38", "comparison first of all Nate Diaz is a", "66:40", "fantastic fighter he's a long time", "66:43", "mixed martial arts veteran he's", "66:45", "outstanding in all areas he has a", "66:47", "fantastic submission game his brother", "66:49", "Nick Diaz one of the best in the world", "66:51", "he's also outstanding and all and his", "66:53", "brother Nick I believe is vegan he's", "66:56", "probably a better example cuz you know I", "66:58", "mean even though Nick hasn't beaten like", "66:59", "some of the top-flight fighters in a few", "67:01", "years back when he was in Strikeforce he", "67:03", "was top of the food chain he's he's an", "67:05", "elite fighter for sure I'm not sure if", "67:06", "he was vegan back then I'd have to ask", "67:08", "him but the point being that nate is a", "67:11", "exceptional exceptionally skilled", "67:14", "athlete and he was coming into that", "67:17", "fight on extremely short notice so he", "67:20", "was most likely following his off camp", "67:23", "diet which is eggs and eatin fish and", "67:26", "things along those lines partying in", "67:28", "Mexico so who knows what the fuck he was", "67:30", "doing it was like 11 days out they call", "67:32", "him and they set up this fight I forget", "67:34", "how many days out it was but it was a", "67:35", "very very short amount of time Conor was", "67:38", "preparing for a 155-pound fight against", "67:42", "ha failed dos Anjos so he was reducing", "67:44", "his caloric intake dropping his weight", "67:47", "down to try to make this hundred fifty", "67:49", "five pound weight class it's a big cut", "67:51", "for him so when when you do that you you", "67:53", "are in anticipation that the person", "67:55", "you're fighting is also doing that so", "67:57", "you both kind of agree that you're going", "67:59", "to be in a certain weakened state when", "68:01", "you actually weigh in at 155 pounds it", "68:03", "was like two weight classes below his", "68:05", "normal let me go make it keep going", "68:07", "so he's this is that was the first and", "68:09", "only time that well except that rematch", "68:10", "with Nate was the only time that he's", "68:12", "fought at 170 so they made a decision to", "68:15", "fight at 170 instead of 155 because Nate", "68:19", "did not have time to reduce his calories", "68:21", "and cut the weight and it takes a long", "68:23", "time it's a slow process of neza big", "68:25", "fella he walks around probably over 200", "68:28", "pounds easy and he drops weight and he", "68:30", "didn't want to drop that much weight", "68:31", "he's a big guy man he's big and long and", "68:34", "Conor was dropping his weight down to", "68:37", "155 so he's 10 days out and he just", "68:39", "starts packing on food eating as much", "68:41", "food as he can not only that but", "68:45", "stylistically Nate's", "68:47", "nightmare for him Nate has a fucking", "68:49", "evil submission game he's tough as nails", "68:51", "his endurance is always fantastic", "68:54", "because offseason he's always doing", "68:56", "triathlons and he's always doing like", "68:58", "endurance sports I mean he's in", "69:00", "phenomenal shape and his jujitsu is like", "69:02", "many levels better than Connors I mean", "69:05", "he's a legit top of the food chain mmm a", "69:07", "black belt in jujitsu so they have this", "69:09", "fight", "69:10", "Connor gets tired Nate beats him up gets", "69:13", "him on the ground submits them and", "69:14", "they're saying this is a victory for", "69:15", "veganism what they don't say is five", "69:18", "months later they fought and Connor beat", "69:20", "him they fought again they fought they", "69:23", "this time they had a full training camp", "69:24", "Connor prepared and it was a very close", "69:26", "fight I should say you could have vote", "69:28", "you could have scored it either way I", "69:30", "mean it's it was a really close fight", "69:31", "razor's thin but the fact remains Conor", "69:34", "beat him in the rematch so I'm going to", "69:36", "leave this out of the narrative like oh", "69:37", "my god the vegans are dominating look", "69:39", "vegan dominated but he's you know this", "69:41", "is a last minute fight Connor goes up", "69:44", "and wait Nate Diaz", "69:45", "you know steps in and and takes care of", "69:48", "business and wins the fight it speaks", "69:50", "more to how good Nate Diaz is than a", "69:52", "vegan diet right and it doesn't take", "69:55", "into account that four months later or", "69:56", "five months later whatever it was he", "69:57", "loses and he's not vegan I mean there's", "70:01", "there fuels it's sometimes there are a", "70:02", "few other examples like that in the film", "70:04", "there where you catch like a certain", "70:06", "window of it but they don't show what", "70:08", "happens afterwards we talked about the", "70:09", "vegan honeymoon so Brian Jennings the", "70:12", "boxer yes they talked about he went", "70:15", "vegan in end of 30 2013 he was 17 I know", "70:19", "before he was vegan and he's been so", "70:22", "he's seven and four after that so you", "70:25", "can't say that that's because he", "70:27",

"70:36", "since then well the argument against", "70:39", "that would be that he's moving up into", "70:42", "the upper echelons of the heavyweight", "70:43", "division and it's filled with killers", "70:45", "like any combat sport and that as he got", "70:47", "in many fighters don't make it to get in", "70:50", "and he lost to wasn't one of the", "70:54", "Klitschkos yes I think he lost to",

"71:04", "yeah I mean that that upper alone you", "71:06", "get to this Andy Ruiz Deontay Wilder I", "71:09", "mean killers yeah it's like not most", "71:11", "people that get up into that division", "71:13", "they start losing HP here's a good", "71:15", "example too of this principle of context", "71:18", "being everything because he said in the", "71:20", "film my early years growing up in

so", "153:19", "there was a guy who said let's see dr.", "153:24", "Scott Stoll that's slighty teen Jamie so", "153:27", "he says in animal products you're", "153:29", "getting protein packaged with",

briefly", "153:47", "address each of those but before I do", "153:50", "that I want to just say a word about", "153:52", "mechanisms versus outcomes so okay", "153:55", "nutrition research can focus

mechanisms what", "154:05", "caused those outcomes right so use the", "154:08", "example of red meat early you know they", "154:11", "saw in these big observational studies", "154:13", "that people who ate more red meat died", "154:16", "more or had more heart attacks or", "154:17", "whatever we know that that was because", "154:19", "of healthy user bias it wasn't you know", "154:21", "accurate

the", "154:38", "outcome isn't there so you had that", "154:42", "large paper that was just published the", "154:44", "five papers in the annals that showed", "154:46", "very basically no evidence

when we've got this", "154:57", "exhaustive study that says that it", "154:59", "doesn't yeah but let's humor them okay", "155:02", "and talk about these mechanisms for a", "155:04", "minute so neu5gc that", "155:07", "sugar basically acts as a signaling", "155:09", "molecule it helps distinguish self from", "155:11", "not self most mammals produce it humans", "155:15", "don't but like cows do so

"155:55", "and then you have groups like the Masai", "155:57", "you could not design a diet higher in", "156:00", "five new neu5gc they they drink blood", "156:04", "and milk from cow and they eat cow beef", "156:07", "yeah and they have no you know extremely", "156:10", "low rates of cardiovascular disease and", "156:12", "they look great I mean have autoimmune", "156:18", "disease and are dying that early so", "156:21", "alright so that's new 5 GC then we have", "156:23", "heme iron so this is the form of iron", "156:25", "that's in beef and other animal products", "156:27", "so it is true

that's", "158:20", "everyone knows that I mean yeah so that", "158:24", "was a huge omission or", "158:26", "oversimplification I mean I think you", "158:28", "said this before and I agree with you",

"160:58", "you eat heme iron in the context of a", "161:00", "super crappy standard American diet its", "161:03", "associated with cancer and a problem but", "161:06", "if you eat heme iron in a

steak", "161:18", "yes different quality but I think it's", "161:21", "probably more likely that they're not", "161:22", "eating that is far less grain fed grain", "161:26", "finished beef over there when you eat it", "161:29", "it's it's really evident when you have a", "161:31", "steak over there so TMAO and then gut", "161:34", "microbiota and I think we're done after", "161:36", "that okay no I think we did enough", "161:40", "no so TMAO this is a molecule that's", "161:44", "generated from choline p\u00e9tain and", "161:46", "carnitine in the gut by a microbial", "161:49", "metabolism and

argument okay", "163:19", "Kamio is bad we shouldn't eat red meat", "163:21", "and eggs because of TMAO but halibut", "163:24", "raises TMAO 53 times more than meat and", "163:27", "eggs and if you

"163:57", "yeah the other thing is that back in the", "164:01", "original paper by dr.

"164:13", "for effective urinary clearance of TMAO", "164:15", "so what that suggests is that even if we", "164:18", "eat TMAO our body clears it out pretty", "164:20", "quickly in the diet", "164:22", "so if TMAO is high it's probably because", "164:25", "of other factors and studies have found", "164:27", "at least 3 one is insulin resistance", "164:30", "increases TMAO levels by an

percent of are obese so", "164:42", "it's possible that just being an insulin", "164:44", "resistant overweight American increases", "164:47", "your TMAO it's got nothing to do with me", "164:49",
