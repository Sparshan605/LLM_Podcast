put", "05:38", "together and set up pipe bombs and", "05:41", "pressure cooker bombs in case he", "05:42", "couldn't steal the guns so if he", "05:44", "couldn't get guns he was going to kill",

those", "05:56", "three things take those three things", "05:58", "away", "05:58", "kids don't do that you give a kid who's", "06:00", "16 17 18 purpose", "06:02", "he can't go off and kill people who has", "06:04", "something to do he's a reason to live", "06:05", "remember this is a public suicide if you", "06:08", "have a reason to live and you think the", "06:10", "right answer is to go do something you", "06:11", "don't kill yourself if you don't kill", "06:13", "yourself there's no public suicide mass", "06:15", "shootings all of a sudden not", "06:16", "tremendously reduced",

you", "06:24", "can't restrict guns I'm saying this", "06:27", "makes actual sense this is where you and", "06:28", "I great company because I don't agree", "06:30", "with that I don't think that anyone is", "06:32", "trying to keep these school shootings in", "06:35", "the same state there are now I think", "06:38", "that there's two things one no one wants", "06:40", "to", "06:41",

by and take", "07:19", "your firearms that's already happening", "07:22", "in New York State and they now want to", "07:23", "create red flag laws which means a", "07:25", "teacher can now do it so

have the cops go and", "07:36", "take his father's fire I definitely want", "07:37", "to talk about this but I want to bring", "07:39", "it back to what you said earlier you", "07:40", "don't think they want to fix the problem", "07:42", "yet you don't think that's true I just", "07:45", "don't think they have a viable solution", "07:47", "that they think is politically viable", "07:49", "perhaps but I think my solution seems", "07:52", "cloaca viable people I say everyone I", "07:55", "say this to you they go oh wow you're", "07:57", "right well you are definitely right that", "07:59", "they're lonely sad people that are", "08:01", "lashing out I think you're definitely", "08:02", "right that in many instances it's a", "08:04", "public suicide yep and I think you're", "08:06", "definitely right that the vast majority", "08:08", "of them are on psychotropic drugs yeah", "08:10", "which do have a disassociative aspect to", "08:14", "them where they're not even sure they're", "08:15", "aware of what they're doing this is if", "08:17", "you talk to those people that have been", "08:21", "on these things things don't mean", "08:23", "anything and like a car accident in", "08:25", "front of them doesn't mean anything", "08:26", "people have various reactions to various", "08:30", "SSRIs and antidepressants but one thing", "08:33", "that happens is you lose the highs and", "08:36", "lows and everything is just flat you", "08:38", "become numb yes and you become numb to", "08:40", "almost anything it happens absolutely", "08:42", "again it varies depending upon the", "08:44", "individual that's on these things sure", "08:46", "part of that would allow someone to do", "08:49", "something horrific which they wouldn't", "08:52", "be able to before", "08:53", "well there's two things remember here", "08:54", "one I'm not concerned with being", "08:56", "righteous I'm concerned with happy New", "08:58", "Yorkers and happy people that's what I", "09:00", "want righteousness is very low on my", "09:02", "priority of things so that doesn't sound", "09:04", "if what I'm saying sounds bad I'm okay I", "09:07", "want to fix the problem the second thing", "09:09", "is another politician which means I", "09:11", "don't have I don't have a career or how", "09:14", "to protect I don't have interests I have", "09:16", "to serve the average donor is $75 so I", "09:20", "don't have a bunch of people who are any", "09:21", "huge checks so don't have that concern", "09:23", "either so maybe in four years I'll be", "09:25",

person", "83:29", "maybe has seven juniors seven peers and", "83:32", "three or four seniors they'll pick a", "83:34", "couple of juniors a couple of peers and", "83:35", "a couple of seniors who will

out how well children", "84:00", "are doing it could be a situation right", "84:02", "how about graduation rate I like that", "84:04", "too graduation rate could work right way", "84:06", "by what

what I said so taking some tests", "84:15", "of course", "84:16", "so you're judging them by these tests", "84:18", "it's correct and let me standardize that", "84:20", "is correct that's why it's a difference", "84:21", "between the tests that you would judge", "84:23", "them on and standardized tests your", "84:24", "standardized test is usually given by", "84:27", "federal or state authorities it's", "84:29", "usually written someplace out", "84:30", "State it's usually decided based upon", "84:32", "the company that bids the right bid and", "84:35", "it doesn't necessarily decide what's",

districts create their own", "84:56", "tests and the odds are they'll wind up", "84:58", "copying each other most the time anyway", "85:00", "it's finally we'll see what works the", "85:02", "issue is you're assuming that a", "85:03", "standardized test has value I don't I", "85:05", "don't assume in standardized tests I'm", "85:07", "sorry I'm just asking you what would the", "85:08", "alternative to a standardized test be is", "85:10", "is it is a district-wide test district", "85:14", "one yeah what's wrong with that", "85:15", "standardized for the district I'll take", "85:17", "that sure much better why would that be", "85:19", "better than for the state because each", "85:21", "each school district is different", "85:24", "because each because each county in New", "85:27", "York State is different each reality is", "85:29", "different", "85:29", "they're just physically socially they're", "85:33", "just they're different regions so they", "85:35", "should have different standards sure in", "85:36", "terms of how they graduate I think what", "85:38", "an a is and what's a pass how you get", "85:44", "through school and with that would it be", "85:47", "even across the board I mean would you", "85:49", "be like it would be better", "85:51", "would you have schools that would be", "85:53", "worse and they would all have the same", "85:54", "grades look if you wanted to I think you", "85:57", "could easy create a system to where at", "86:00", "the end of the day meaning at the end at", "86:02", "the end meaning 16 in this case where", "86:04", "I'm from K through 10 at a K through 10", "86:06", "where there is one statewide", "86:08", "standardized test which is where I said", "86:09", "no standardized testing until high", "86:11", "school", "86:11", "mmm-hmm right so prior to high school I", "86:14", "don't want standardized testing at high", "86:17", "school I'm fine with it", "86:18", "at that point the kids a bit more mature", "86:20", "the kids kind

"86:27", "testing because I'm thinking do I want", "86:28", "to go to college do I want to prep", "86:30", "school do I want to trade school okay so", "86:32", "you're also a with standardized testing", "86:34", "in high school that's what I said okay", "86:36", "so that's 14 is 16 basically just two", "86:38", "years it's correct yes in those areas", "86:40", "I'm totally happy with that

"87:03", "bad so once we get to the high school", "87:06", "level yeah there's standardized testing", "87:07", "at that point but I'm saying before that", "87:09", "but before that is when the kids are", "87:12", "building up who they are right before", "87:14", "that's when the kids are building up who", "87:16", "they are as as students as who they", "87:18", "think they are in their life are

see larger", "89:24", "chunks of Medicaid Medicare and at one", "89:27", "point when it's Medicare even they pack", "89:29", "up and head to Florida North Carolina or", "89:32", "South Carolina right
