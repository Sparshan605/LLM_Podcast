conversation", "25:06", "really I mean I'm not right I have my", "25:09", "own opinion I felt like Aldo did enough", "25:10", "to win and I felt like I think people", "25:12", "they I think there was a moment in the", "25:17", "first round where you could say more", "25:19", "eyes took control early landed some good", "25:22", "shots and then he did get the take town", "25:23", "later in the in the fight in the film", "25:26", "that's that that first rounds like a", "25:27", "tricky one first runs a tricky one like", "25:29", "I can see you giving that close fight it", "25:31", "doesn't matter yes I was fine with that", "25:33", "I want it all though because I love", "25:35", "although but you know I just don't by", "25:37", "the way their scoring things it just", "25:39", "doesn't make any sense to me I just I", "25:41", "just don't I don't know how you're gonna", "25:42", "get a ten nine and then another ten nine", "25:45", "is a totally different thing you could", "25:47", "have a 10-9 where a guy beats the shit", "25:49", "out of a guy and you can have a 10-9", "25:50", "where who knows who won the round you", "25:52", "could have a 10-9 where almost nothing", "25:53", "happens or you have a 10-9 that's crazy", "25:55", "right that doesn't make sense to me it", "25:57", "doesn't oxidize to weapons yeah two", "26:02", "extra two weapons no takedown what's", "26:06", "better a takedown or punches what's", "26:08", "better a jab or a body kick right", "26:10", "better what's better I don't know we're", "26:12", "gonna figure this out yeah you can't", "26:14", "just have guys lose decisions and those", "26:16", "decisions being made by people who", "26:18", "shouldn't even be in this conversation", "26:20", "well as far as like what's I worry less", "26:24", "valuable in terms of like technique I", "26:26", "would score it like this I think so if", "26:28", "you're a boxer", "26:29", "landing a jab is always easier than", "26:31", "landing a right hand against somebody", "26:32", "who's equally as good as you are", "26:33", "okay so landing a right hands at", "26:35", "motherfucker so for me I would always", "26:37", "count so so I think that you know a push", "26:41", "kick with your front foot is not the", "26:44", "same as a switch kick that blasts", "26:46", "somebody in their fucking head or their", "26:48", "ribs so I would count those kinds of I", "26:51", "don't know how you would how you would", "26:53", "categorize it but maybe like the", "26:55", "equivalent of what a right hand is which", "26:57", "is somebody trying to actually close the", "27:00", "deal knock you out versus set you up", "27:02", "with a jab", "27:03", "setting you up with a jab sending over", "27:05", "the front kick setting up those things", "27:06", "is different than blasting somebody with", "27:09", "a double leg blasting somebody with a", "27:11", "back foot roundhouse kick or wheel kick", "27:13", "exactly there's so many weapons yeah", "27:16", "there's so many on how you do that that", "27:18", "would you because that's a strike", "27:19", "regardless and sometimes that strike", "27:21", "doesn't you know it doesn't do anything", "27:23", "well you can yeah you can't have a guy", "27:25", "who's like super durable right and you", "27:27", "catch him with a couple of really good", "27:28", "shots but then he takes you down and", "27:30", "lands a couple good elbows who won the", "27:32", "exchange I don't know I mean maybe if", "27:34", "the end of the round is the guys on top", "27:36", "I have no evidence that you're gonna get", "27:37", "up you know you might get up eventually", "27:39", "but so far you're on the ground and he's", "27:41", "holding you down he's punching you that", "27:42", "means a lot", "27:43", "then again somebody can take your back", "27:44", "right in their control you're doing", "27:46", "great defense yeah but it means a lot", "27:48", "the guy took you back we got it we got", "27:49", "it mean we have to look at in terms of", "27:51", "like your your percentage of being", "27:55", "successful once you get to a position", "27:57", "increases right with the complexity the", "28:00", "position the control that you get in", "28:01", "that position so if you get a person in", "28:03", "half guard that is not as good as you", "28:05", "having someone's back with the body", "28:06", "triangle on and one arm around the neck", "28:08", "and one arm controlling the hand right", "28:10", "even if the guy is not tapped that guy", "28:11", "is in significant danger well wrestling", "28:13", "wrestling you get a point for an escape", "28:15", "you get a point you when you take", "28:17", "somebody down you get a point for that", "28:18", "but when you take their back that's two", "28:20", "points right that's fine that's good", "28:22", "but you're close to finishing his life", "28:24", "and you have his back yeah this point", "28:26", "shit I don't want to hear this", "28:27", "yeah then you get a guy's back you got a", "28:28", "body triangle and you got an arm around", "28:30", "the neck and you controlling the other", "28:31", "arm somehow or another you're really", "28:33", "close to taking his life yeah that's the", "28:35", "difference so will this point stuff it's", "28:38", "great like what's more important than", "28:40", "escape is when a guy has your fucking", "28:42", "back and he has an arm under your chin", "28:44", "and and you're just fighting hands yeah", "28:46", "you don't want to be there man and if he", "28:48", "has enough
