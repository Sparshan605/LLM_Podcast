landed the question", "62:13", "was whether or not he decided to stay", "62:15", "down once he got hit and I think he did", "62:17", "if you watch it just doesn't look", "62:18", "realistic I give you watch when he goes", "62:21", "down the way he went down scene may be", "62:24", "legit but the way stumbled around it he", "62:27", "didn't stumble around like a guy whose", "62:28", "central nervous system got jacked here", "62:30", "we were watching right here oh wow what", "62:33", "a great producer you've got the best", "62:34", "watch this look at this pink see that's", "62:38", "a real punch 100% and the drug that him", "62:41", "dropping is real - there's no doubt", "62:43", "about it the question was whether that", "62:46", "was enough to take him out look at that", "62:47", "bank it could have but watch the case", "62:50", "see if you could find the knockout Jamie", "62:52", "because the what's not what's crazy", "62:54", "about it wasn't him dropping him cuz I", "62:57", "think that was legit what's crazy was", "62:59", "how afterwards he stumbled around like", "63:02", "he couldn't move like he couldn't get up", "63:04", "it just didn't seem real we just had it", "63:07", "there a long explanation I don't know if", "63:09", "they're gonna show the actual thing well", "63:12", "they they just showed him trying to get", "63:14", "up that kind of like Kevin Spacey here", "63:20", "it is here it is play it watch here's", "63:22", "the punch boom now watch he goes down", "63:25", "and he just sort of laid down on his", "63:27", "back and then he kind of stumbled around", "63:31", "and acted like he couldn't get up they", "63:33", "just keep showing it over and over again", "63:34", "it was a hundred percent of legitimate", "63:36", "punch and people who say it's not", "63:37", "they've never seen people get Kayode", "63:40", "because people get K out in all sorts of", "63:41", "weird ways it doesn't really make sense", "63:43", "like it's a human being getting punched", "63:46", "the face weird shit happens especially", "63:49", "you get punched on the jaw like people", "63:52", "get touched with like a jab sometimes", "63:55", "and they go out it doesn't make sense", "63:57", "and also sometimes here it is it's right", "63:59", "here it's also sometimes it's weird", "64:01", "because you might have gotten hurt real", "64:04", "bad in training so a lot of guys come in", "64:06", "to these fights and they're already", "64:08", "injured they just pump right there now", "64:11", "let's watch them stumble around so he", "64:13", "goes down and he lays down on his back", "64:15", "see this is where I'm not buying it this", "64:17", "he just seems like horse shit but I", "64:20", "could be wrong", "64:21", "now he's stumbling see like right there", "64:24", "that seemed like he decided to stumble", "64:26", "and go down and he's trying to get back", "64:28", "up I could be wrong I could be wrong but", "64:32", "I'm not buying it and so the referee was", "64:36", "Jersey Joe Walcott who's a very famous", "64:40", "yeah champion of his own but now they", "64:44", "still a vital stop the fight I don't", "64:46", "know I don't remember
