it's", "68:21", "through a helmet or a glove but until my", "68:23", "brain is being tricked to imagined ones", "68:25", "and zeros I'm not gonna call VR VR do", "68:27", "you think it's impossible to do that", "68:29", "without some sort of an electronic aid", "68:31", "or do you think that they'll be able to", "68:32", "figure out I thought at one point in", "68:34", "time I don't know about the

generate thoughts", "68:50", "you know what I think I just had a", "68:52", "bizarre thought about that I was like", "68:53", "now what they'll do is I'll engineer", "68:54", "because I need the transhumanism thing", "68:56", "they'll enter like they'll create a chip", "68:58", "first that allows you to perceive that", "68:59", "but you'll still need power generate it", "69:00", "but then we'll get so good with like", "69:02", "fucking manipulating molecules and DNA", "69:04", "will create the cell that will be put", "69:07", "into something virus style that gives", "69:08", "people perception to that so imagine", "69:10", "like a chip for Bluetooth or Wi-Fi we're", "69:12", "gonna engineer that on a on a", "69:13", "biochemical level so that you can now", "69:16", "perceive this

fuckin you know or yeah shed but", "69:28", "which it kind of sucks their time", "69:30", "bluetooth the 7.0 if they're talking", "69:32", "about genetic engineering and they're", "69:34", "always talking about the possibility of", "69:35", "nanobots going in cure cancer right yeah", "69:38", "what about the idea of artificial cells", "69:40", "I mean they've what was it that they", "69:43",

"69:50", "it was is some some structure some small", "69:52", "structure and atom or whatever it was", "69:54", "and reproduce itself what if they", "69:56", "couldn't create artificial cells they in", "69:59", "inject this artificial cell into you and", "70:01", "slowly but surely over the course of you", "70:04", "know however long long it takes to", "70:06", "regenerate and read all of your

think", "70:17", "we're having class war now class warfare", "70:19", "now imagine the haves and have-nots in", "70:22", "that day and age when it's like it's", "70:23", "pure Gattaca shit of like well hey I was", "70:25", "born with it because I got upgraded", "70:27", "right and you know I can perceive this", "70:29", "shit that you can't and manipulate and", "70:30", "manipulate you with my
