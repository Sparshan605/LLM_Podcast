["00:02", "four three two one", "00:05", "yes my quest we are live finally are you", "00:09", "ready I am ready let's do it do you're", "00:11", "getting a lot of heat online from all", "00:12", "these it's all the Flat Earth people and", "00:15", "the chemtrail people those are the", "00:16", "people that are mad at you the most yeah", "00:18", "that's my specialty", "00:19", "chemtrails and flooded us yeah well", "00:21", "that's I ask people just this is", "00:25", "hilarious", "00:26", "I asked people online I said my quest", "00:29", "for meta bunk is gonna be here what", "00:31", "would you like me to debunk and one of", "00:34", "the first ones was chemtrails because", "00:36", "you cannot debunk it it's real", "00:38", "dun-dun-duh I would I would say this to", "00:41", "anybody who thinks that that has got to", "00:44", "be the most ineffective government", "00:48", "program of all time like you ask people", "00:50", "what they're doing by smearing things in", "00:52", "the sky and the number one thing they'll", "00:55", "say is like weather control weather", "00:57", "controls one well they don't have any", "00:59", "fucking control the weather because if", "01:00", "they did they make it rain all over", "01:01", "Santa Barbara and stop these fires yeah", "01:04", "I mean there's hundreds of millions of", "01:06", "dollars where the damage going on right", "01:08", "now there's a fire that's bigger than", "01:09", "the city of Washington DC they think", "01:11", "they're making this fires they think", "01:12", "that that's part of the conspiracy", "01:14", "anything that happens is always part of", "01:17", "the conspiracy what do you think it is", "01:19", "like what is what is it with", "01:22", "conspiracies like why are they so", "01:25", "attractive to people there's something", "01:27", "going on with people right yeah I think", "01:29", "yeah I've been looking into this a lot", "01:32", "and you have especially since your", "01:35", "government show well I'm doing research", "01:38", "with a book I'm writing", "01:38", "every school escaping the rabbit hole", "01:40", "and it's about how people get into the", "01:42", "rabbit hole and how people get out of", "01:43", "the rabbit hole so the whole thing is", "01:45", "about the rabbit hole which is something", "01:47", "basically people get sucked into and I", "01:50", "think people do a lot of research into", "01:52", "the reasons behind people getting into", "01:54", "conspiracy theories like the", "01:55", "psychological reasons and the", "01:57", "personality reasons and things like that", "01:59", "but I think most conspiracy theorists", "02:02", "are just regular people they're just", "02:04", "ordinary people who get sucked into", "02:06", "something and why do you think that is", "02:07", "just from talking to them they tell me", "02:11", "like they're their origin stories", "02:13", "the origin story is essentially and they", "02:16", "tell me what happened to them when they", "02:17", "got into conspiracy theories and it", "02:19", "nearly always starts with them looking", "02:21", "at some video and now now yes it starts", "02:23", "with them looking at some video and then", "02:25", "they just get sucked in yeah and then", "02:28", "they start looking at another video in", "02:29", "another video in another video and", "02:30", "Facebook and YouTube is feeding them", "02:33", "these videos because once you start", "02:35", "going down that road you just can't you", "02:38", "can't change your trajectory right it's", "02:42", "it's hard to train in YouTube what since", "02:45", "they instigated this autoplay thing or", "02:49", "instituted this autoplay thing or the", "02:52", "next video plays immediately and they're", "02:54", "all related yeah I think that's", "02:56", "definitely been a thing with people and", "02:57", "also like the suggestions on the right", "02:59", "hand side if you're watching one video", "03:00", "on particular subject yeah I was doing", "03:02", "some experiments with that I said of", "03:03", "like a completely blank YouTube account", "03:05", "and our just go in there and type in one", "03:08", "thing like contrails mm-hmm and of", "03:10", "course when you look at contrails on", "03:12", "YouTube like half the videos you can get", "03:14", "it going to be chemtrail videos right", "03:15", "and so if the first video you click on", "03:17", "is a chemtrail video then they just set", "03:20", "you down that road well I remember this", "03:22", "was in the days I think before YouTube", "03:27", "this is in the days when maybe YouTube", "03:30", "was around but it just wasn't that", "03:31", "popular I remember me and my friend", "03:33", "Eddie were high as fuck and we're", "03:35", "talking to my neighbor and there was", "03:37", "some plane that was flying over and we", "03:39", "were wondering why the clouds coming", "03:41", "from behind this plane stood so long so", "03:44", "I asked him I said this neighbor I just", "03:46", "call him bling-bling cuz bling-bling was", "03:49", "incapable of talking about anything", "03:51", "other than objects like all we talked", "03:54", "about that was nice cars out a new car", "03:55", "where'd you get that watch like that was", "03:56", "bling bling all bling-bling wanted to", "03:58", "talk about is like material possessions", "04:00", "so so he were parked in front of his I", "04:05", "was saying hide woman and I said hey man", "04:06", "do you remember clouds look stick it", "04:08", "around in the sky not long and he's like", "04:10", "no I don't know is that a new truck I'm", "04:12", "like remember how ironic it was cuz I", "04:17", "had told Eddie about bling-bling you", "04:19", "know they're like this is all this guy", "04:20", "cares about and wants to talk about and", "04:22", "then he did that while we're out there", "04:23", "but I remember thinking man", "04:25", "how weird would it be if all the sudden", "04:28", "clouds from jet engines started", "04:32", "appearing and it just appeared right", "04:34", "before our eyes and we hadn't noticed it", "04:35", "but I wasn't sold it didn't make any", "04:39", "sense to me because my thought on it was", "04:41", "the amount of people that had to be", "04:43", "involved you're talking about all these", "04:44", "different airplanes get all these people", "04:45", "to keep their mouths shut these are", "04:47", "their pilots right so no they're not", "04:49", "making shit tons of money and they live", "04:51", "here too that's the other thing like if", "04:53", "there's actually spraying something in", "04:55", "the sky", "04:55", "mm-hm they live here too like what do", "04:57", "they spray in themselves", "04:58", "well the ferry now is that it's", "04:59", "basically the power elite in the country", "05:02", "is doing these chemtrails as a kind of", "05:05", "latched last-ditch attempt to maintain", "05:07", "power before the entire world collapses", "05:10", "into chaos so they think it's kind of", "05:12", "like a desperate situation a power grab", "05:14", "mmm exactly it's is that they're hanging", "05:17", "on to have their kind of last hurrah", "05:19", "really the they feel like the end of the", "05:21", "world is nigh like you know there's", "05:23", "about to be this environmental disaster", "05:24", "and the chemtrails are the only thing", "05:26", "that is holding everything together", "05:28", "that's the thing that you get if you go", "05:30", "to like you know geo and geoengineering", "05:32", "watch that Dane Wigington go mm-hmm he", "05:34", "he's basically a an apocalyptic prophet", "05:38", "now he's basically preaching about how", "05:40", "everything is going to end soon and the", "05:42", "the chemtrails are the only thing that's", "05:45", "stopping it they're also making it worse", "05:47", "so he's kind of saying like you know the", "05:50", "chemtrails are helping but we got to", "05:51", "stop them otherwise they'll make it even", "05:53", "worse but we're pretty much all gonna", "05:55", "die either way", "05:56", "yeah there's a lot of money and we're", "05:58", "gonna die there's a lot of people that", "06:00", "love that that that trope it's just like", "06:03", "something that gets carted out", "06:05", "constantly throughout history because", "06:07", "it's true you are going to die it's like", "06:09", "when are you gonna die you don't know so", "06:11", "because you don't know you're freaking", "06:12", "out like is it gonna be a car accident", "06:13", "is it gonna be a fire it's gonna be an", "06:16", "earthquake it's gonna be a slow aging", "06:18", "death or is it gonna be the chemtrails", "06:20", "taint don't down yeah I think that type", "06:22", "of thing like fear of dying is one of", "06:24", "those fundamental things right so you", "06:26", "know every human is hardwired with", "06:27", "certain things that they're they that", "06:30", "happens in their brain without them", "06:31", "thinking about and fear of dying and", "06:33", "fear of other things fear of leena life", "06:35", "mmm fear of wolves or whatever something", "06:38", "is hardwired and that's the tie", "06:39", "the thing that leads to different types", "06:41", "of thinking that you know you end up", "06:44", "being a conspiracy theorist in part", "06:45", "because your brain is is wired that way", "06:48", "you had a great quote about chemtrails", "06:50", "when we did that television show", "06:51", "together you said chemtrails are like", "06:53", "the training wheels for conspiracy", "06:56", "theorists yeah because they're like", "06:57", "they're they're right above your head", "06:59", "and you just like you see them right", "07:00", "there for people don't understand why", "07:04", "jets produce clouds please explain that", "07:08", "because it's very simple it is very", "07:10", "simple", "07:10", "jet engines have water water in their", "07:14", "exhaust if you look at a car on a cold", "07:17", "day and you see the exhaust coming out", "07:18", "the tailpipe you'll see like a cloud of", "07:20", "condensation sometimes and you'll see", "07:22", "some water coming out and when the exact", "07:25", "same thing happens with jet engines and", "07:28", "when that exhaust hits the cold air it", "07:31", "condenses it freezes it makes a cloud", "07:33", "and contrails are essentially clouds", "07:35", "they're exactly the same", "07:36", "physically as a regular cirrus cloud and", "07:39", "it's dependent upon the amount of", "07:40", "moisture in the atmosphere and you can", "07:43", "actually monitor it online NASA actually", "07:45", "has a website that will show you and I", "07:48", "believe it's set up for pilots right is", "07:50", "that what the air traffic people NASA", "07:52", "actually has a contrail forecasting site", "07:54", "right isn't really for anything it's", "07:57", "just part of that control research but", "08:00", "yeah they have a site where it all", "08:01", "projects like well contrails are gonna", "08:02", "be but you can do it yourself you just", "08:04", "go look up the relative humidity at a", "08:06", "certain altitude there's lots of", "08:07", "different sites you can go to I've got a", "08:09", "whole bunch of them listed on that a", "08:10", "bunk and just like the clouds vary in", "08:14", "the sky or the amount of moisture varies", "08:17", "as well which is one of the reasons why", "08:19", "you will see a jet pass through one area", "08:22", "and you'll see a contrail and then it", "08:24", "almost looks like they shut the the", "08:25", "contrail jets off and then you see it", "08:28", "pick up maybe a couple hundred yards", "08:30", "later", "08:30", "yeah and that's you say like a cloud is", "08:33", "really exactly the same as a cloud if", "08:35", "you look at any picture of a cloudy day", "08:37", "and then just remove all the clouds but", "08:40", "they're still there as invisible clouds", "08:42", "then when the plane comes along it's", "08:44", "almost like the plane is this magic pen", "08:47", "revealing these invisible clouds because", "08:49", "all the cloud is is a region of the sky", "08:51", "where the humidity is above", "08:53", "level so you know that the humidity is", "08:56", "pretty patchy across the sky cause like", "08:58", "there's a cloud here and right next to", "08:59", "it there's no cloud so where the cloud", "09:01", "is it's high humidity where the cloud", "09:03", "isn't it's low humidity but if both of", "09:04", "those were just lowered like 10% then", "09:07", "you get no clouds at all then a plane", "09:09", "comes along it raises the humidity in", "09:13", "the cloud area and in the known cloud", "09:14", "area but this area because it was a bit", "09:16", "higher you get a trail forming in this", "09:18", "area getting a trail forming so it's", "09:20", "exactly the same as invisible clouds", "09:22", "yeah and for people that are watching in", "09:26", "your looking up you think they're", "09:27", "spraying something if you're conspiracy", "09:30", "minded and because of a lot of the", "09:32", "videos that are out there a particular", "09:34", "two that were recommended to me are what", "09:36", "in the hell are they spraying right so I", "09:38", "got to meet with that guy that made", "09:40", "those documentaries and right away I", "09:42", "knew something was wrong like he's", "09:44", "either on adderall or something he's", "09:46", "just like real real edgy and speeded up", "09:51", "and just just an odd guy which is like a", "09:54", "lot of people that are conspiracy", "09:56", "conspiratorial II minded they seem to be", "09:59", "like very they're nervous and agitated", "10:02", "and and when we went over like why he", "10:05", "think one of the things that was talking", "10:06", "about was the soil samples and water", "10:08", "samples and that they've detected all", "10:12", "this aluminum and barium in water and", "10:15", "particularly aluminum and he's like", "10:17", "showing me all these results that he had", "10:20", "but even on the very results that he", "10:21", "showed me it said sludge like he had", "10:24", "sent them out for testing and I said", "10:26", "well what did you send in his egos well", "10:28", "I sent some water from these you know", "10:30", "ponds and I said but it says sludge on", "10:32", "your testing and he said nobody was", "10:35", "water I go okay but the lab said it's", "10:37", "sludge I go what is sludge she goes", "10:39", "water I don't know what sludge is", "10:40", "exactly I go well let's look sludge is a", "10:43", "combination of water and dirt okay so", "10:45", "you sent water and dirt so do you know", "10:48", "that aluminum is one of the most common", "10:50", "metals on earth and you could basically", "10:52", "scoop up a patch of dirt pretty much", "10:55", "anywhere and find a bunch of aluminum in", "10:57", "it it's really really common in trace", "10:59", "amounts I go so what you did is you", "11:03", "tested dirt and it tested positive for", "11:06", "being dirt", "11:07", "musically that's exactly what it is and", "11:09", "the guy was kind of freaking out I'm", "11:10", "like how did you how did you not put", "11:13", "this together yourself like if you're", "11:15", "the guy who's making this video and", "11:16", "you're trying to find a reason why you", "11:19", "could you know some facts that you could", "11:21", "throw at people we could say hey look", "11:22", "the government is definitely spraying", "11:24", "things in the sky they're spraying", "11:25", "aluminum look we found the aluminum and", "11:27", "we found it in the water it's in your", "11:29", "water supply it's gonna get in your body", "11:30", "it's gonna poison you look we found in", "11:32", "the water how did he how the fuck did he", "11:34", "not look at it himself is what I was", "11:36", "thinking and me when me and him were", "11:38", "having this conversation I realize like", "11:39", "you have these people that go down us", "11:42", "they're not open-minded in regards to", "11:45", "these subjects they go down a very", "11:47", "narrow road and that road is the", "11:50", "government is doing something to me I", "11:53", "need to find out what it is yeah and", "11:55", "they're really motivated to actually", "11:56", "find evidence yes so that they're trying", "11:58", "to find something and you know actually", "12:01", "trying to find an alternative", "12:02", "explanation isn't really that attractive", "12:04", "to them so they find aluminum in the", "12:06", "water or in the soil or whatever and", "12:08", "then they glom onto that as being you", "12:11", "know evidence of geoengineering and", "12:13", "that's great for them because they can", "12:14", "just find loads and loads of samples of", "12:15", "soil and that's something that gets", "12:17", "repeated online that very fact over and", "12:19", "over again the aluminum that they found", "12:21", "in the water it's one of like the core", "12:23", "tenets it's not one of the pillars of", "12:24", "the chemtrail thing there's a there's", "12:27", "like four or five different things like", "12:29", "in every conspiracy theory there are", "12:30", "these core beliefs right that the 99% of", "12:35", "the people who believe in the theory one", "12:37", "core belief is that you work for the", "12:38", "government", "12:39", "yeah that is a core belief nick is a", "12:43", "retired video game creator you could", "12:45", "find that out made video games right", "12:48", "Tony Hawk yeah made shit ton of money", "12:50", "and decided to to debunk dorks yeah I", "12:55", "didn't it didn't start out and I", "12:58", "wouldn't refer to them as dork but yeah", "13:02", "they're dorks if they don't believe this", "13:04", "is the problem you're not a dork if you", "13:07", "fall for something you're a dork if you", "13:09", "fall for something you don't believe the", "13:11", "science that shows that it's impossible", "13:13", "but it's not real that if you are", "13:15", "spraying aluminum in the sky folks it", "13:17", "would look like aluminum you dummy it", "13:19", "wouldn't look like a cloud", "13:20", "it wouldn't dissipate it would look like", "13:22", "a thin mist essentially yeah and metal", "13:25", "is not it's heavier than fucking air and", "13:28", "vapor it's not it's not gonna just sit", "13:29", "up there like that it would it would be", "13:31", "a very different experience if it's", "13:33", "slowly settled to the ground and", "13:34", "wouldn't look like a cloud and there's", "13:36", "no reason to do it", "13:37", "there's no benefit whatsoever there's no", "13:39", "scientific evidence but ever uncovered", "13:41", "ever that there's any benefit for", "13:44", "anybody of spraying aluminum over people", "13:46", "it's just it's just it's a waste of", "13:48", "alumina thing even with the the whole", "13:50", "geoengineering field it's really no", "13:52", "solid evidence that it will work we", "13:55", "don't know what the side effects will be", "13:57", "we don't know how much we're gonna we", "13:59", "would need to spray and we don't know", "14:01", "like you know if if you know when we", "14:03", "stop doing it will the world bounce back", "14:05", "in a terrible way and it'll be a big", "14:06", "disaster well that's an interesting", "14:08", "thing because one of the reasons why", "14:10", "contrails are interesting to study is", "14:13", "because they actually do have an effect", "14:16", "on the temperature of the earth and this", "14:17", "is something that we found out after", "14:19", "9/11 when September 11th happened in", "14:22", "2001 it was the the big disaster there", "14:25", "was a shutdown on all flights in the", "14:29", "United States and when they did that the", "14:31", "temperature changed yeah because there's", "14:35", "clouds literally do provide like a cover", "14:39", "and is it does do they act as an", "14:42", "insulator or an escalator they", "14:45", "essentially act as an insulator they", "14:47", "block radiation incoming radiation", "14:50", "during the day and they block outgoing", "14:53", "radiation at night that the net effect", "14:55", "is that they actually block more", "14:57", "outgoing radiation than they do incoming", "14:59", "radiation hmm so if planes didn't fly at", "15:02", "night then you would you would cool the", "15:05", "earth dam hmm you'd have to stop flying", "15:08", "you know quite a bit before nighttime so", "15:10", "if all the flights in the world were", "15:11", "between like 5:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.", "15:14", "local time then you could actually cool", "15:16", "the world down by just not having any", "15:18", "flights at night because if the night", "15:19", "flights that have this really big kind", "15:21", "of blanketing effect that stop the", "15:23", "outgoing radiation so the night of", "15:25", "flights actually heat the world up yes", "15:27", "they do they act like a like a blanket", "15:29", "hmm", "15:30", "you know how it's it's warmer on a", "15:33", "well in a cloudy day like he doesn't get", "15:35", "his cold at night here deserts get", "15:36", "really cold at night because there's", "15:37", "nothing over them they don't have any", "15:39", "any cover well it's one of the reasons", "15:41", "but yeah they the contrails will", "15:45", "actually warm the planet because the the", "15:50", "amount of outgoing radiation they block", "15:51", "is just way high I just go to the", "15:53", "wavelengths and the size of the", "15:55", "particles and whatnot so that that's", "15:57", "something to be concerned about that's", "15:59", "something that people are legitimately", "16:00", "monitoring what people need to", "16:03", "understand is just because you feel like", "16:04", "when you look up in the sky see this", "16:06", "crisscross patterns that they're", "16:07", "spraying you mm-hmm", "16:09", "no-one's spraying you know this is just", "16:11", "a natural reaction to jet engines and", "16:15", "condensation in the atmosphere and the", "16:17", "heat and the moisture of the jet engine", "16:19", "that's all it is their it they are", "16:21", "actually talking about a way of using", "16:22", "contrails for a kind of geoengineering", "16:24", "and this is something that people

right", "21:13", "isn't it yeah the you spray sulfur", "21:16", "dioxide which isn't exactly a reflective", "21:18", "particle but it acts as a I can youkilis", "21:20", "for upper atmosphere clouds and things", "21:23", "like that it's basically like he said", "21:25", "the same thing of volcano does when one", "21:27", "of volcano erupts it spews a whole bunch", "21:29", "of sulfur dioxide and various other", "21:31", "things into the upper atmosphere and", "21:33", "that creates haze basically which which", "21:36", "blocks the incoming radiation and cools", "21:39", "things down every time a big volcano", "21:42", "goes off you see a little dip in the", "21:45", "earth's temperature because of this this", "21:46", "blocking effect right and so the theory", "21:49", "is that you could do something similar", "21:51", "and you could do both spraying things", "21:52", "out of planes but he's talking about", "21:54", "things that we might do in the future", "21:56", "you see every every uses the future", "21:59", "tense like we could do this in mind they", "22:01", "may do this the effects might be this", "22:03", "and he's talking about the possible", "22:05", "geopolitical impacts of it which are", "22:08", "very significant like if one country is", "22:10", "going to be spraying something", "22:12", "would cause the Satan monsoons to double", "22:16", "in intensity or to half in intensity in", "22:18", "India that could cause the deaths of", "22:21", "millions of people from famine and", "22:23", "flooding and this is what people think", "22:25", "has happened with the big hurricanes in", "22:27", "the United States they do think that", "22:29", "yeah there's no evidence of that", "22:30", "actually happening at the pattern of", "22:33", "hurricanes is pretty much the same as", "22:35", "it's been for a long time when you look", "22:37", "at the statistical variations there's", "22:39", "you know maybe a bit more intense", "22:40", "because the oceans are a bit warmer but", "22:42", "it's not you know people think that", "22:46", "hurricanes have been steered yeah yeah", "22:51", "through half but yeah that doesn't make", "22:53", "any sense but there is there are ways", "22:54", "that do make sense which are cloud", "22:56", "seeding they keep you do lots of seeding", "22:59", "of the hurricane on one side you could", "23:02", "perhaps like reduce the amount of", "23:04", "humidity a moisture on that side and so", "23:08", "it looking a little bit more and move", "23:09", "over to one side so there are ways that", "23:11", "you might work and they did actually", "23:13", "experiment with this I think back in the", "23:15", "70s or so there was one experiment where", "23:18", "they tried seeding a hurricane but he", "23:20", "ended up going somewhere else other than", "23:24", "weather where they intended it and it", "23:26", "destroyed a whole bunch of houses the", "23:28", "problem with having a video like this is", "23:30", "that this guy is admitting that they", "23:33", "have looked into potentially spraying", "23:36", "things no one has ever denied that we've", "23:40", "been looking into geoengineering for", "23:42", "decades it's been proposed like in in in", "23:45", "some sense for over a hundred years the", "23:47", "other problem serious and since the 70s", "23:49", "the other problem is he cave it he gave", "23:50", "it initials s AI that's a problem people", "23:54", "love initials they love it is super", "23:58", "excited not even but most people use the", "23:59", "SRM which is the solar radiation", "24:03", "management that's good one - yeah SR and", "24:07", "si I CIA DEA Jake aerosol injection yeah", "24:17", "but it would have to be studies and", "24:20", "recipes there are there are lots of", "24:22", "studies going on right now though people", "24:24", "are studying geoengineering there", "24:26", "actually lots of people who specialized", "24:28", "in to your engineering well I was gonna", "24:29", "say is they'll studies would have to be", "24:31", "available for people to understand but", "24:33", "nobody wants to do that nobody wants to", "24:35", "go and you wanted to look up and see the", "24:37", "thing behind the jet and go they started", "24:38", "it they're spraying this patchwork look", "24:40", "this haze all over us which it does", "24:42", "happen you could have a clear sky and", "24:44", "you have the right conditions in a bunch", "24:46", "of jets flyover and also it's very hazy", "24:48", "it does it doesn't that's the type of", "24:49", "thing that's being reported since the", "24:51", "second world war written even earlier", "24:53", "the first contrails that were spreading", "24:54", "out into clouds were reported in like", "24:56", "the 1920s yeah why I took some of these", "24:59", "photos and I put them up I think the", "25:01", "last time we had this conversation where", "25:03", "you could see him from World War two", "25:04", "these jets and you see the contrails", "25:07", "behind the Jets and the but some people", "25:10", "that's the other thing", "25:11", "it's like contrails dissipate but", "25:14", "chemtrails stay well that's not you", "25:17", "misunderstand what happens yeah the", "25:19", "contrails stay if there's more moisture", "25:22", "you know if the conditions are correct", "25:24", "they stay and if the conditions are", "25:26", "barely enough to make a contrail they", "25:28", "dissipate fairly rapidly with that thing", "25:30", "they kind of use circular logic if you", "25:32", "ask them why do you think that contrails", "25:34", "dissipate in chemtrails stay and say", "25:37", "because I can see it", "25:38", "if you look up you look at the", "25:39", "chemtrails and they're staying and the", "25:41", "contrails are dissipating is that how do", "25:43", "you know which is which well the", "25:44", "contrails are the ones that dissipate", "25:45", "yeah so they they don't have any basis", "25:48", "for their belief and yeah the one thing", "25:50", "I do which you've probably seen is that", "25:52", "video where I go through all my old", "25:53", "books on on the weather and I look up", "25:57", "and each one of them the section on", "25:58", "contrails and I read the bit in it that", "26:01", "says like contrails persist for hours", "26:03", "sometimes a contrails sometimes spread", "26:05", "out to cover the sky contrails light", "26:07", "lasts a long time and I go back from", "26:09", "these books from the 1990s all the way", "26:12", "back to the 1950s and I've got books in", "26:15", "the 1940s and if you show people these", "26:18", "actual books it's a really powerful way", "26:20", "of like getting through to them because", "26:22", "they're just assumed the contrails can't", "26:25", "persist right and they've assumed that", "26:27", "this is a recent phenomenon because they", "26:29", "don't remember it weren't paying", "26:30", "attention", "26:31", "yeah well the people don't notice them", "26:33", "until ninety percent of the people don't", "26:36", "notice contrails until they hear about", "26:37", "the chemtrail", "26:39", "Jerzy theory a lot of people they will", "26:41", "hear about it and then the same day they", "26:43", "will go outside and look at the sky and", "26:45", "then that's the first time they've ever", "26:46", "noticed these contrails even the people", "26:49", "who like me and they're high ups in the", "26:51", "in that they're in the the chemtrail", "26:54", "movement they only notice them when they", "26:57", "hear about the theory there's a guy I", "27:01", "can't remember his name now but he lives", "27:03", "in San Diego and he never noticed them", "27:04", "until like 2014 and he lived there all", "27:07", "his life and now he's publishing", "27:08", "scientific papers J Marvin Herndon is", "27:11", "his name he's publishing these", "27:13", "scientific papers about how the spraying", "27:15", "coal ash and I'd the waste products of", "27:17", "you know burning coal in power stations", "27:19", "for spraying that in the upper", "27:20", "atmosphere he's actually got like three", "27:22", "or four papers published in these kind", "27:24", "of pay to publish scientific journals", "27:26", "and that's kind of becoming a bit of a", "27:29", "problem like like this this thing with", "27:32", "Brennan the CAA guy people bring that up", "27:34", "all the time all the time all the time I", "27:36", "mean you just have to explain it to them", "27:38", "again he's talking about the future use", "27:41", "and then this guy is talking about", "27:44", "possible solutions for for global", "27:48", "warming", "27:48", "yeah now the problem with it is when", "27:51", "he's talking about possible solutions", "27:52", "and then people look up and they see", "27:54", "these actual clouds that are created by", "27:57", "jets they assumed this is already begun", "27:59", "that the government would not tell us", "28:01", "about it right that's because they don't", "28:02", "understand contrails the difference", "28:05", "between contrails and what this stuff", "28:07", "would look like yeah yeah and just the", "28:09", "fact that contrails look like this", "28:11", "they've heard that contrails shouldn't", "28:14", "persist well what's another thing that", "28:15", "drove me crazy is like if you really", "28:17", "want to worry about health consequences", "28:19", "of these things that you see in the sky", "28:23", "there's there's a reality to it and the", "28:25", "reality is they're burning jet fuel oh", "28:28", "yeah and all the people that live around", "28:29", "the airports get sick like it's there's", "28:32", "there's high levels of respiratory", "28:34", "illness that are associated with living", "28:36", "within a certain distance of airplanes", "28:38", "or airports if you are in a congested", "28:41", "hub like LAX don't buy a house yeah like", "28:44", "a block away it's not good for your", "28:46", "health they're burning jet fuel that's", "28:48", "gonna get in the air pollution lets", "28:50", "pollution from", "28:51", "cars yeah but it's even more intense", "28:53", "because there have been thousands and", "28:55", "thousands of giant planes mmm", "28:57", "even lay small airports like santa", "28:59", "monica they have problems with that like", "29:00", "if you look at the houses just at the", "29:02", "end of santa monica runway which is", "29:03", "right next to the end of the runway", "29:06", "there's these houses they did tests were", "29:08", "freely various metal particulates and", "29:10", "stuff and the ones right by the end of", "29:12", "the runway you know they get the air", "29:13", "pollution of course it's very real", "29:15", "problems that's the real problem you", "29:17", "know and that's a real one now imagine", "29:19", "if that was something that the", "29:20", "government was engineering if they", "29:22", "really were engineering spraying things", "29:24", "to give people respiratory illness so", "29:27", "that the hospital industry could profit", "29:30", "and whatever the reason was right that", "29:32", "would be you know something that people", "29:34", "could be concerned with like look", "29:35", "there's a real connection between", "29:37", "airplanes and illnesses but it's not", "29:40", "spraying stuff in the sky that's not", "29:42", "real i understand people love these", "29:45", "things and i understand people don't", "29:47", "trust the government those things", "29:48", "completely make sense to me but you got", "29:50", "to pay attention to what's real and", "29:52", "what's not real", "29:52", "because as soon as you don't do that", "29:54", "then all the real stuff that the", "29:56", "government does all the real stuff the", "29:58", "government does like these fucking roads", "30:00", "they're gonna build in alaska right now", "30:02", "through dangerous areas where they have", "30:05", "salmon rivers but they're gonna they're", "30:07", "gonna start doing mining i think what is", "30:09", "the Pebble Beach is that the no what is", "30:12", "the the big mining issue in Alaska that", "30:17", "is going on right now still Bay Bristol", "30:21", "Bay that's it why don't people in", "30:24", "Bristol I don't know how I got those two", "30:25", "confused", "30:25", "I don't mine Pebble Mine it that's what", "30:27", "it is and they want they want to do this", "30:31", "and it's near a major salmon area where", "30:33", "these salmon use this river and they're", "30:36", "people that live there terrified that", "30:38", "they're gonna do this this is a real", "30:40", "for-profit thing where they're putting", "30:44", "the environment at risk", "30:45", "that's real so this is something that", "30:47", "people should be concerned about but", "30:49", "they're not they don't get concerned", "30:51", "about those kind of things you know", "30:52", "environmentalists do and you know", "30:54", "conservationists do but the conspiracy", "30:56", "theorists don't they don't look at that", "30:58", "and go hey here's clear evidence of the", "31:01", "the government being in bed with", "31:03", "enormous business", "31:04", "that stand a prophet spectacular amounts", "31:07", "of money from risking the environment", "31:10", "and risking these very delicate salmon", "31:12", "fisheries yeah that type of thing is the", "31:15", "exact reason why I still spend so much", "31:17", "time debunking stuff like conspiracy", "31:19", "theories because I think that so much of", "31:23", "conspiracy theories the results of", "31:25", "confident the effect of conspiracy", "31:26", "theories is distracting people from real", "31:27", "issues from real issue yeah yes I agree", "31:30", "like if you like you say with the the", "31:31", "airplane stuff like if people are", "31:33", "thinking that spraying chemicals out of", "31:35", "the butt of the air like at the", "31:35", "airplanes that is not going to be", "31:37", "worried about regular pollution and if", "31:41", "they think that they're controlling the", "31:43", "climate already they're not going to", "31:44", "worry about but yeah any type of global", "31:46", "warming", "31:47", "so let's find one that we disagree on", "31:49", "yeah I think you believe the official", "31:52", "story of the JFK assassination do you", "31:54", "more or less yeah more or less yes my", "31:57", "belief and this is this changes over", "32:00", "time I think that Lee Harvey Oswald was", "32:03", "in on it I think he was a part of it but", "32:05", "I think there were multiple people that", "32:07", "were in on it", "32:08", "that's what I believe do you think that", "32:09", "multiple shooters yes and one of the", "32:11", "reasons why I believe that is because", "32:13", "the formation of the single Bullet", "32:14", "theory and the single Bullet theory was", "32:16", "formed because the fact that they had to", "32:19", "account for one bullet that hit the", "32:21", "underpass ricocheted off and puts a man", "32:23", "in the hospital and that before that", "32:27", "they did not have an explanation for why", "32:30", "all of these bullets bullet holes all", "32:33", "these wounds were in all these different", "32:34", "people's bodies the other reason why I'm", "32:36", "inclined to believe there's a conspiracy", "32:38", "was the fact that they found that bullet", "32:40", "on Connolly's gurney when they brought", "32:42", "him into the hospital it's too", "32:43", "convenient and the bullet itself is", "32:45", "fairly pristine now knowing as much as I", "32:48", "know about bullets from personal", "32:50", "experience of hunting you can't hit", "32:52", "anything with a book I pulled a lot of", "32:54", "bullets out of animals when you shoot an", "32:56", "animal and you hit bone those bullets", "32:58", "they distort brutally I mean they don't", "33:02", "look like that if they go through two", "33:04", "people and hit all sorts of bone that's", "33:06", "the bullet that came out of Connolly's", "33:08", "body or what Connolly's gurney excuse me", "33:10", "and that's the bullet that they're", "33:12", "attributing to this single Bullet theory", "33:15", "if you look at the path", "33:17", "of the bullet that goes through Connally", "33:19", "or goes through Kennedy and then goes", "33:21", "through Connally that to me is not", "33:24", "unbelievable it's not unbelievable that", "33:26", "one is hey you gotta look at the other", "33:28", "one", "33:28", "but even that one but no no see what I'm", "33:30", "saying even that one is not unbelievable", "33:33", "it is believable to me because I know", "33:35", "that bullets do strange things when they", "33:37", "hit things right but you got to combine", "33:39", "that with the fact that the bullet came", "33:40", "out fairly pristine which mean it didn't", "33:42", "actually go through a kind of a bouncy", "33:43", "path like that right it went out a", "33:45", "straight path

found pretty close to what actually", "34:46", "happens no they did within within the", "34:48", "ground no no no every bullet that hit", "34:50", "bone got distorted that's just what", "34:51",

something", "38:20", "happens people go back and they look at", "38:22", "everything that happened and then they", "38:23", "say well that sounds like something", "38:24", "significant right like with the Vegas", "38:26", "shooting there was a woman walking", "38:29", "around the crowd in the Vegas shooting", "38:32", "saying you're all gonna die this is what", "38:35", "some people said and this was like half", "38:37", "an hour before the actual shooting", "38:39", "itself so people take that event and", "38:42", "then yeah since a lot of people did die", "38:45", "they think that this woman actually knew", "38:47", "what was going to happen and she was", "38:49", "trying to warn people right but you also", "38:51", "get crazy people wandering around saying", "38:53", "things all the time

totem pole of signs with all these", "39:25", "different things and I was taking photos", "39:26", "of it and the guy was yelling out", "39:27", "everyone's going to die I mean he was", "39:29",

was", "39:45", "trying to warn them he would have a bit", "39:47", "more specific yes very specific right if", "39:49", "she knew something do you see do you", "39:51", "find it no it's I know I put it up there", "39:53", "because we were mocking it maybe I put", "39:55", "it on my Instagram story and it went", "39:56", "away", "39:57", "I don't think so though I think it's", "39:59", "it's there from I want to say I want to", "40:03", "say it was at least six months ago but", "40:05", "we were mocking this guy because I like", "40:07", "this guy's got a lot of fuckin signs", "40:08", "like one signs not enough I goes this is", "40:10", "the guy this is the reason why Twitter", "40:12", "only has 140 characters motherfuckers", "40:14", "like this I think I remember it's like", "40:15", "July because there's like 120 degrees", "40:17", "out too wasn't it yes it was very hot", "40:19", "this goofy asshole had this giant stack", "40:21", "of signs so the back to the Kennedy", "40:25", "thing what do you think happened do you", "40:27", "think that Lee Harvey Oswald probably", "40:29", "acted alone I think he probably acted", "40:30", "alone I think like the physics of what", "40:32", "happened like is fairly consistent with", "40:35", "the single shooter theory now admittedly", "40:38", "the Magic Bullet is a bit strange but I", "40:42", "don't think it's out of the bounds of", "40:44", "possibilities I do because of the fact", "40:48", "the metal particles there's more bullet", "40:50", "fragments in Connolly's body than we're", "40:52", "missing from that almost pristine bullet", "40:54", "and even though the fact that it hit", "40:56", "Connally at the very end if it went", "41:00", "through all that flesh and it didn't hit", "41:02", "any bone until it hit his wrists then it", "41:05", "would not have been compromised very", "41:07", "much ballistically it would still be", "41:08", "going credibly fast it still would have", "41:10", "smashed into that bone it did enough to", "41:11", "break his wrist and it would have", "41:13", "distorted the bullet and that's just", "41:15", "what happens with bullets see", "41:16", "unfortunately I don't really follow JFK", "41:18", "conspiracy very much and the reason I", "41:20", "don't is that there are already like I", "41:23", "think literally over a thousand books", "41:25", "mm-hmm okay I've read a few um I got", "41:30", "into case closed", "41:31", "that was a Vincent Bugliosi book as out", "41:34", "who it was but I was like this guy's got", "41:37", "an agenda it just didn't it there's", "41:39", "there's many books that you could read", "41:42", "about the Kennedy assassination and some", "41:44", "of them favor the conspiracy and some of", "41:47", "them favor the assassination I think", "41:49", "they have a lot of them have merit on", "41:51", "both sides one thing that drives me", "41:53", "crazy was people say that you could", "41:55", "never make that shot that's fuckin", "41:57", "bullshit that's bullshit", "41:59", "this is why I know it's bullshit because", "42:01", "it was only like a couple hundred yards", "42:02", "like a couple hundred yards shooting it", "42:05", "something the size of a person's head is", "42:07", "easy what about Jesse Ventura trying to", "42:09", "do the", "42:10", "you know three three shots again three", "42:12", "shots off he didn't know what he's doing", "42:14", "look I mean first of all you would if", "42:17", "you were used to that rifle and you", "42:19", "practice that reason someone said oh the", "42:20", "scope was off I think that's bullshit", "42:22", "too", "42:23", "the reason why I think that's bullshit", "42:24", "is cuz it's easy to knock a scope off", "42:26", "you have to have a direct chain of", "42:27", "evidence between the time Lee Harvey", "42:30", "Oswald had that scope shooting that", "42:32", "rifle the moment he shot that rifle and", "42:34", "then you have to hand it off to someone", "42:37", "who checks the scope right then because", "42:39", "if you drop a rifle the scope goes off", "42:41", "just drop it I've done that before I", "42:43", "dropped a rifle once when I was hunting", "42:45", "in Wisconsin and my scope was off by six", "42:47", "inches at a hundred yards just dropping", "42:50", "it so the idea that he could have never", "42:52", "made that shot cuz the scope is off", "42:53", "scopes get adjusted that's what happens", "42:56", "when you drop a scope they move that's", "42:58", "that's a whole thing about ballistics", "43:00", "you have to check them you go to the", "43:01", "range you set up a lead sled you lay the", "43:05", "the rifle down so it's perfectly stable", "43:07", "you squeeze off a shot you use the", "43:09", "binoculars you find out where the shot", "43:11", "hit on the target and then you adjust", "43:12", "the scope they're adjustable so the idea", "43:15", "that his scope was no good is crazy the", "43:17", "idea that that shot was too far to make", "43:19", "insane it was only I think it was less", "43:21", "than a hundred yards when they think he", "43:23", "made the first shot which is a chip shot", "43:25", "that's a shot that he would make without", "43:26", "even a rest now he's making this shot", "43:28", "resting on the window so he's perfectly", "43:31", "steady the idea that that was impossible", "43:33", "is crazy the idea that no one can do", "43:35", "that in three shots that's been", "43:37", "disproven someone can do it someone", "43:39", "who's really good at reloading and", "43:41", "loading can do it just cuz Jesse Ventura", "43:43", "couldn't do it but Jesse's super", "43:45", "conspiracy mind is like he goes all in", "43:48", "with the conspiracy theory that's the", "43:50", "motivated reasoning thought of yes I", "43:52", "don't know if it's doing it yeah it's", "43:53", "just very show or because he really", "43:55", "believes it I worked with the same", "43:56", "people that did his show the same people", "43:58", "that did his show the reason why I did", "44:01", "Joe Rogan questions everything is they", "44:02", "wanted me to take over Jesse's show", "44:04", "after what I've done and I was", "44:06", "uninterested I was like I'm knocking I'm", "44:08", "not that guy I'm not like the I believe", "44:10", "every conspiracy guy I go I think", "44:12", "there's people I think people have a", "44:14", "real weird vested interest and proving", "44:18", "that things are a conspiracy I'm", "44:20", "interested in finding out what things", "44:21", "really are like legitimately what", "44:23", "they really are yeah and even if I'm", "44:25", "wrong like I have I'm not interested in", "44:28", "reinforcing things I've already said if", "44:31", "I find out that what I said was wrong", "44:33", "I'm interested in repeating and I was", "44:35", "wrong as many times as I can to get it", "44:37", "out to as many people as I can", "44:38", "yeah I'm with you because I think it's", "44:39", "important so this is this JFK thing", "44:42", "there's bullshit on both sides of it but", "44:44", "the idea that this guy who went over to", "44:46", "Russia married a Russian citizen came", "44:48", "back here was I mean he was absolutely", "44:51", "involved in some shady weird shit with", "44:53", "Cuba he's a fucking weird guy Lee Harvey", "44:56", "Oswald was a weird guy the idea that he", "44:58", "was completely innocent I'm not buying", "45:00", "that either", "45:01", "I didn't yeah I did you know by the idea", "45:04", "that it's proven that he acted entirely", "45:06", "alone it's entirely possible that the", "45:08", "other people who were like helping him", "45:10", "or motivating him or giving him", "45:12", "instructions even yeah the thing I don't", "45:15", "think it's really proven is the the", "45:17", "additional shooter theory it's not", "45:19", "proven and there have been people that", "45:21", "said they heard things from behind them", "45:22", "the problem with that is chaos when you", "45:25", "have gunshots first of all gunshots in", "45:28", "an area like a Dealey Plaza the echoes", "45:30", "yeah echoes ring out and people claim to", "45:33", "see things and hear things they even", "45:35", "believe themselves if you tell someone", "45:37", "that you heard something in the bushes", "45:40", "and then you run away that person will", "45:42", "say I heard something in the bushes and", "45:44", "then other people were repeated it", "45:45", "becomes the narrative and that just gets", "45:47", "it's real hard creates memories yes you", "45:50", "can't you can't you can't point to", "45:52", "somebody and say there was somebody", "45:53", "there and they'll think there's somebody", "45:54", "like that because they yeah the brain is", "45:56", "so chaotically working it forms memories", "46:00", "in a very weird way especially when it", "46:02", "comes to something that's so significant", "46:04", "like the president getting shot or any", "46:06", "sort of violent thing now this is", "46:08", "something that gets repeated ad nauseam", "46:09", "about 9/11 it's something that people", "46:11", "point to where they think that when the", "46:14", "planes hit those buildings that there", "46:16", "was detonations that caused Tower 1 and", "46:18", "Tower 2 to fall there's no way they", "46:20", "would have fallen like that like when", "46:22", "people say you know they heard things in", "46:24", "the buildings they heard explosions", "46:26", "people always say shit like that and on", "46:29", "top of that if you're dealing with a", "46:30", "building collapsing like that you're", "46:33", "gonna hear a lot of crazy shit yeah", "46:35", "yeah you get a they're all going to be", "46:37", "explosions yes things are falling you", "46:39", "know there's the mean there were people", "46:40", "falling off the buildings which goes to", "46:42", "tower seven that's another one yes", "46:44", "coming up see if you can find the video", "46:47", "Jamie there's a the video that shows", "46:50", "what really happened in Tower seven", "46:51", "there's a guy who was a conspiracy guy", "46:54", "he was really deep into conspiracies and", "46:56", "then the more he started looking into", "46:58", "Tower seven the more he realized that", "47:01", "everyone is just showing the very final", "47:03", "video where Tower seven collapses like a", "47:06", "controlled demolition and it looks", "47:08", "exactly like a controlled demolition", "47:09", "however if you find the full video you", "47:12", "see that the interior had collapsed", "47:15", "moments before like quite a bit before", "47:18", "Edward current I think is that's exactly", "47:21", "what is seeming you find that", "47:23", "gentleman's video but he shows how the", "47:26", "top of it you could see the top of tower", "47:29", "seven give in which is consistent with", "47:32", "this idea that the diesel fuel that they", "47:35", "had in the basement had created wasn't", "47:38", "it like diesel tanks yeah that was an", "47:39", "early theory at the diesel fuel that", "47:42", "that was actually fueling the fire but", "47:43", "they never found any evidence that", "47:45", "actually the diesel fuel contributed to", "47:47", "the fires it was just regular office", "47:51", "fires which is what everybody finds so", "47:53", "suspicious the diesel never caught fire", "47:56", "they might have been after to collapse", "47:59", "I think they recovered one of the tanks", "48:00", "with some days are still in it so series", "48:04", "of diesel likely fed by a series of", "48:06", "diesel generators locating the lower", "48:08", "floors which is where most of the fires", "48:09", "were concentrated so at least one of the", "48:13", "diesel Tower of diesel tanks didn't", "48:15", "light up is that we're saying yeah the", "48:17", "the theory like this theory is that the", "48:20", "diesel had nothing to do with it", "48:22", "okay so NIST which if you are a", "48:25", "conspiracy theory person they get really", "48:27", "angry when you bring up nest is that the", "48:29", "government the government man so I think", "48:32", "this is an older video yeah this isn't", "48:34", "the video jam there's one by Edward", "48:36", "current yeah and what it does is it", "48:39", "shows the top of the building cave-in", "48:42", "first quite a bit before the rest of the", "48:45", "building so this idea that it all", "48:47", "cave-in", "48:48", "like a controlled demolition because", "48:50", "they detonated all those things so", "48:55", "dududududu is that air we're current", "48:58", "yeah I gotta find a good spot of the", "49:00", "video to show its mm-hmm okay you know", "49:02", "yeah so what happened what they think", "49:04", "was that the fire this is shitty design", "49:07", "of a building and the fire caused", "49:10", "internal damage to all the floors well", "49:13", "you see that the World Trade Center one", "49:15", "fell basically against the side of of", "49:19", "seven you know that the building was all", "49:21", "kind of like all the windows were broken", "49:24", "on the backside there was one column in", "49:26", "the middle of the back that was missing", "49:27", "and a big chunk of the lower west side", "49:31", "was gonna gouge it out right so this", "49:34", "idea that it was just a fire yeah it", "49:36", "wasn't just a fire yeah the fire is what", "49:38", "triggered the collapse eventually but", "49:41", "the fact that all the windows were", "49:42", "missing from the south side contributed", "49:45", "a lot to that because you got a lot of", "49:46", "wind flow through see if he's got the", "49:50", "the I don't know maybe this is a bad", "49:53", "thing to do while you're actually doing", "49:55", "the show so this is what the idea is the", "49:57", "NIST computer models that all these", "49:58", "floors had collapsed outside collapsed -", "50:02", "yeah but what this guy Edward current", "50:06", "had showed in his video I think it was", "50:08", "him was he showed that the top part that", "50:11", "press yeah the top penthouse had", "50:12", "collapsed first there it is see if you", "50:14", "see the penthouse collapsing see you", "50:16", "sinking it up but with the two the two", "50:18", "videos the simulation so it's sitting up", "50:21", "there and then boom you see it collapse", "50:23", "and some windows breaking right other", "50:25", "down exactly and that's something that", "50:27", "no one ever shows and then it gives in", "50:29", "right so this is not a quick thing like", "50:33", "a controlled demolition all those", "50:35", "windows giving in is indicative of all", "50:37", "those floors collapsing probably more", "50:40", "than it is the idea of you know the", "50:42", "people that want to see conspiracy think", "50:45", "that those bombs were going off there", "50:47", "and that as those detonations or", "50:49", "explosions were going off that that's", "50:52", "what caused all those floors to collapse", "50:53", "on top of each other yeah I think like", "50:55", "that's talking about with the core", "50:56", "beliefs of the conspiracy theories with", "50:58", "9/11 this this fact that World Trade", "51:00", "Center 7 looks like", "51:01", "controlled demolition that's right is it", "51:03", "core belief but when you actually get", "51:05", "into something and describe what's", "51:07", "actually happening you have to go", "51:08", "through a much more complicated", "51:09", "conspiracy theory and a much more", "51:11", "complicated way of looking at what", "51:13", "actually happened and now they're trying", "51:17", "to do a complicated study of World Trade", "51:20", "Center 7 at the University of Alaska", "51:22", "this is something paid for by architects", "51:24", "and engineers for 9/11 truth they're", "51:26", "trying to actually figure out how they", "51:28", "can reconcile controlled demolition with", "51:31", "the fact that it collapsed the way it", "51:33", "did right so they're trying to actually", "51:35", "explain something which doesn't really", "51:37", "need explaining because the explanation", "51:38", "has been done by NIST already so what", "51:41", "they're trying to do is find something", "51:43", "that reinforces their initial idea", "51:45", "instead of just look at the facts itself", "51:48", "saying oh yeah you look at the top of", "51:50", "the penthouses collapsing that's not", "51:52", "indicative of a controlled demolition", "51:53", "that's indicative of the model that NIST", "51:55", "described which is a slow burn inside", "51:58", "extremely hot deterioration of all the", "52:01", "internal structure everything starts to", "52:02", "collapse inside and then the outside", "52:04", "collapses to yeah well some of them will", "52:06", "say that that is actually how controlled", "52:07", "demolitions are done you blow up the", "52:09", "interior of the building first and then", "52:10", "you blow up the exterior at the building", "52:12", "but the problem is that none of the", "52:15", "exterior columns were cut there was no", "52:17", "explosion seen on the exterior columns", "52:20", "if you look at the World Trade Center", "52:22", "one and two coming down you know you can", "52:23", "kind of imagine their explosions going", "52:25", "all the way down because the things that", "52:26", "look like explosions from the falling", "52:28", "floors but in seven you just see the", "52:30", "building kind of just kind of crumpled", "52:31", "down so they have to kind of explain", "52:33", "that so they come up with this study", "52:35", "that they fund it it's cost them like", "52:37", "nearly four hundred thousand dollars and", "52:40", "they're trying to come up with an", "52:41", "explanation that doesn't involve fire so", "52:45", "they're saying like if if it was", "52:47", "controlled demolition and the way they", "52:49", "would have done it is blowing up these", "52:50", "interior columns and it would have", "52:53", "pulled in the exterior and collapsed the", "52:55", "way we see in the video and I think that", "52:57", "some of them say that the penthouse", "53:00", "thing was a separate thing because they", "53:01", "wanted to have a neat demolition so they", "53:03", "first of all blew up a few floors just", "53:05", "underneath the penthouse so it neatly", "53:07", "collapsed inside the building and then", "53:09", "they blew up some floors at the bottom", "53:11", "so it's all fairly now itself without", "53:13", "damaging the surrounding buildings too", "53:14", "much so they've got this comp", "53:15", "Lexx theory and it's based on", "53:17", "confirmation bias it's based on", "53:19", "confirming this idea that this is a", "53:20", "controlled demolition not on examining", "53:23", "the whole thing as it is and going okay", "53:25", "is it possible that the NIST model is", "53:28", "correct and that these files look the", "53:30", "thing that I bring up to people all the", "53:31", "time when they want to talk about", "53:32", "conspiracies there's a real conspiracy", "53:34", "in 911 and that's the fact that it", "53:36", "happened the fact that they did fly", "53:38", "planes into buildings that's a", "53:40", "conspiracy and they pulled it off that", "53:42", "actually did happen people don't want", "53:45", "that to be it they want it to be a much", "53:48", "broader conspiracy involving world", "53:50", "governments that are trying to close in", "53:53", "on you know all our rights and this is", "53:56", "the way to do it and yeah there's", "53:57", "proportionality people want something to", "53:59", "be in proportion to the size of the", "54:01", "event when they think just like a bunch", "54:03", "of Arabs with knives isn't a big enough", "54:07", "cause so they think that it has to be", "54:10", "something you're more significant and", "54:12", "even like with the physics of it they", "54:14", "think near the plane flew into the", "54:15", "building and he didn't collapse so why", "54:18", "would it why would it collapse some of", "54:20", "them some people don't think that a the", "54:21", "plane we even have that's my thing all", "54:24", "they think he would have bounced off Oh", "54:26", "who the fuck thinks that or some of them", "54:28", "think that the tower would have been", "54:30", "knocked over really yeah but these are", "54:33", "people who have really no conception", "54:35", "whatsoever of physics there's a minority", "54:36", "of people but you'll find people who who", "54:39", "don't understand how", "54:41", "aluminum can cut through steel you know", "54:43", "the columns of the exterior of the World", "54:45", "Trade Center were made of steel very", "54:48", "strong steel and planes are made of", "54:50", "mostly aluminum so they don't understand", "54:52", "how a plane made of aluminum which is", "54:55", "soft can go through steel which is very", "54:57", "hard and strong and the example I always", "55:00", "give to them is the ping-pong ball going", "55:03", "through a ping-pong paddle", "55:04", "if you make it go fast enough this is", "55:06", "something I think myth busters do and", "55:08", "various other people have done you you", "55:10", "send a regular ping-pong ball five", "55:13", "hundred miles an hour into a ping-pong", "55:15", "paddle", "55:15", "it just goes straight through it leaves", "55:17", "a ping-pong ball hole in the middle of", "55:19", "it and that's just what happened on 9/11", "55:21", "the planes were going at 500 miles an", "55:23", "hour I didn't know you could do that", "55:24", "with a ping-pong ball", "55:25", "you can Wow that makes sense it's just", "55:27", "matter well for the", "55:29", "to the amount of mass you're dealing", "55:31", "with to in the speed it's 500 miles an", "55:34", "hour yeah and maybe isn't name to me", "55:36", "doesn't even need to be relatively that", "55:37", "much mass you think a ping-pong ball it", "55:40", "weighs like not one gram and a paddle", "55:43", "weighs like near 200 grams or something", "55:45", "sir and you wouldn't think you've seen", "55:47", "you've seen ping pong paddles they're", "55:49", "this laminated wood and rubber and you", "55:52", "got this flimsy little ball", "55:53", "it's how on earth is that gonna go", "55:54", "through this week it's unintuitive so", "55:56", "you can understand how people would be", "55:59", "confused about why the planes let these", "56:02", "little roadrunner holes see if you find", "56:04", "that you have the Mythbusters thing I", "56:06", "want to see that I here it is wow that", "56:09", "was a hole so they have some crazy air", "56:12", "cannon yep blows all okay here's the", "56:15", "problem with that though here's the", "56:16", "problem with that they're doing that", "56:17", "right in front of that they have to do", "56:19", "that with a ping-pong ball because it", "56:21", "would slow down but I understand but", "56:22", "you're also dealing with the actual air", "56:24", "yeah it's the it's what it is the", "56:27", "ping-pong you can see it in slow motion", "56:29", "yeah because what I was gonna bring up", "56:31", "was a guy killed himself once", "56:33", "accidentally on a movie set because he", "56:36", "took an unloaded gun and he shot it into", "56:40", "his temple and it blew his brains out", "56:42", "yeah I was blank", "56:43", "but the the fact that it was a blank", "56:45", "didn't stop that air from blowing", "56:48", "through there's a thing that people do", "56:51", "when they hunt in Alaska and in", "56:54", "incredibly moist climates and places", "56:57", "where there's a lot of dirt and debris", "56:58", "they will put tape over the top of the", "57:01", "rifle the over the end of the barrel", "57:04", "where the bullet comes over or they even", "57:06", "use a condom and it has no effect", "57:09", "whatsoever on the accuracy of the bullet", "57:11", "because the air coming out of the rifle", "57:14", "barrel from the explosion blows that", "57:17", "tape out before the bullet even gets to", "57:19", "it yeah yeah but you know the only", "57:21", "reason they have to have that thing", "57:23", "right at the end of the barrel is the", "57:25", "ping pong ball with slow downs", "57:26", "yeah that makes is in the act right you", "57:30", "know if you shot something a little bit", "57:31", "heavier but still pretty small it will", "57:33", "go through it yeah I know it makes sense", "57:35", "and you think you got to scale it up", "57:36", "like you know imagine like a beer barrel", "57:38", "mm-hmm made out of steel or aluminum", "57:41", "thing it's like weighs like", "57:42", "like 100 pounds or whatever when it's", "57:44", "full and you imagine that's slamming", "57:46", "into something about now the ping-pong", "57:48", "ball can do something at 500 miles an", "57:50", "hour a beer barrel at 500 miles an hour", "57:52", "can do it normal amount in damage", "57:54", "probably go right through a building", "57:55", "yeah and then you scale up from like a", "57:57", "beer barrel to a 200 ton plane yeah and", "58:01", "200 tons hitting something at 500 miles", "58:05", "an hour", "58:05", "it doesn't matter that it's you know", "58:07", "it's made of aluminum it's still 200", "58:09", "tons or something if it was just you", "58:11", "know a big bag of water hitting", "58:12", "something at 500 miles an hour it would", "58:14", "still make a hole in the side of the", "58:16", "door I think this is a problem with a", "58:18", "lot of these theories is that a lot of", "58:19", "the people that are involved in these", "58:21", "theories are either not educated in what", "58:23", "they're talking about because there are", "58:25", "some various nuances to things like this", "58:28", "ping-pong ball trick or they don't they", "58:32", "don't want to be like they don't want to", "58:35", "look at anything that takes away from", "58:39", "this conspiracy they don't want to look", "58:41", "at anything that debunks or disproves", "58:43", "they just want confirmation of their", "58:45", "initial idea that this is some big grand", "58:49", "conspiracy that someone is in on it and", "58:51", "it's happening right before our eyes", "58:53", "yeah yeah it's quite hard to even get", "58:57", "one point passed a lot of people you", "58:59", "know if someone starts out with that", "59:01", "that theory that you know aluminum", "59:03", "cannot cut steel then that just becomes", "59:07", "like near the the gatekeeping obstacle", "59:09", "that you hadn't get past if you can't", "59:11", "disprove that one thing it doesn't", "59:12", "nothing else matters really for them", "59:14", "because the other plane couldn't have", "59:15", "entered the building therefore", "59:17", "everything is a conspiracy so you cannot", "59:19", "have to address these things yeah you", "59:21", "have to and it's um it's important for", "59:23", "people before they decide that this is", "59:26", "you know the government spraying things", "59:28", "in the sky or that the world is flat or", "59:30", "whatever whatever these things are it's", "59:32", "important to look at all the evidence", "59:33", "these YouTube videos one of the real", "59:35", "problems with them is that they get to", "59:36", "play out without being interrupted much", "59:39", "like a podcast unfortunately but they", "59:41", "get to have these grand statements", "59:45", "without anyone who's an expert stepping", "59:48", "in and stopping them and saying well", "59:50", "that's not true and here's why it's not", "59:52", "true and here's why you can prove that", "59:53", "it's not true which would just do", "59:55", "most of these conspiracy theories really", "59:58", "quickly", "59:58", "yeah and that's that's kind of the", "59:59", "brainwashing aspect of these videos", "60:01", "people people watch these three hour", "60:05", "videos yeah it kind of surprised me at", "60:08", "first I was surprised that people would", "60:10", "you know listen to a three-hour podcast", "60:11", "the you know once you get going in", "60:14", "something you know the first time I was", "60:15", "on your podcast at the time went by like", "60:17", "way nothing", "60:18", "yeah and if you're into something and", "60:19", "you get sucked into it and you've got", "60:21", "this really interesting theory and it's", "60:22", "like all these revelations like oh my", "60:24", "god I'm I'm getting the the real skinny", "60:26", "on the world Wow", "60:29", "yeah you just you you just get sucked in", "60:32", "and then when it's finished you're on", "60:34", "kind of a dopamine high and you want to", "60:36", "do more and you also feel like you're in", "60:38", "on something that people don't know and", "60:40", "you want to tell them about oh yeah and", "60:41", "I've been there I've been there I've", "60:44", "always tell people the dumbest one I", "60:46", "ever believed in was those stupid tubes", "60:49", "that fly through the air rocks", "60:51", "yeah I was hook line and sinker I would", "60:55", "go outside and I would try to find those", "60:58", "things streaking across the sky what it", "61:01", "was was that there was a video that was", "61:03", "made called roswell rods and it was", "61:05", "trying to say that there was these bugs", "61:08", "like things that looked like jellyfish", "61:11", "that were flying through the air so fast", "61:12", "the naked eye couldn't see them but they", "61:14", "were catch them on video cameras mm-hmm", "61:16", "and then finally someone figured out", "61:17", "that what it really was was you could", "61:19", "have an HD camera right next to a", "61:22", "standard definition camera and the", "61:25", "standard see those things flying across", "61:26", "the sky what it's just a video artifact", "61:28", "when the camera cannot pick up those", "61:32", "those bugs it elongates them and streaks", "61:36", "them across the camera Shambala yeah its", "61:38", "motion blur and this guy this guy came", "61:41", "to one of my UFC q and a's once and he", "61:44", "waited in line and yelled out you're", "61:47", "wrong about the rods the rods are real I", "61:49", "can prove it", "61:51", "silly fella but these this that was a", "61:56", "monster quest had proven that on", "61:58", "television they'd set up two cameras", "62:00", "yeah it's so hard when the is actually", "62:02", "being proven and you got this yeah yeah", "62:04", "conclusive proof and yet there are still", "62:06", "loads and loads of people who believe in", "62:07", "in rods", "62:08", "look how it lo look at how he was", "62:10", "describing that it looks like some kind", "62:12", "of alien jellyfish that's so fast it", "62:15", "flies through the air faster than you", "62:17", "can see yeah I mean the problem is these", "62:19", "guys have a vested interest in it being", "62:21", "real he's motivated and not necessarily", "62:23", "by money they're just motivated because", "62:26", "once they believe something they feel", "62:27", "like they're privy to this special", "62:29", "knowledge it's just gonna be such a", "62:31", "letdown if they're wrong", "62:32", "I think it's that end money I mean he", "62:34", "said he sold a bunch of videos I bought", "62:36", "him about two of those bitches I just", "62:39", "try to start out with the assumption", "62:40", "that people are not you know they're", "62:41", "basically good people rather than not", "62:44", "trying to make money right well I think", "62:46", "they also get caught up in the business", "62:48", "of whatever it is you know what if", "62:50", "you're in the UFO business and then", "62:52", "someone comes along and shuts down your", "62:54", "business you're gonna try to well then", "62:56", "be sort of they're not gonna look at it", "62:58", "objectively they're gonna go I want to", "63:00", "keep my business alive protect my", "63:02", "business yeah it's like architects and", "63:05", "engineers for 9/11 truth they're there", "63:07", "are like half million dollar a year", "63:09", "business they taking between 400 and 800", "63:12", "thousand dollars a year and the", "63:14", "precedents of the the architects and", "63:17", "engineers he gets paid a salary of like", "63:19", "eighty-five thousand dollars a year and", "63:21", "he gets his expenses paid now that", "63:23", "doesn't mean that he doesn't believe in", "63:25", "what is doing he sure started out as", "63:28", "like a you know hardcore believer in", "63:29", "9/11 truth but over the last you know 10", "63:33", "years this has become his life and his", "63:36", "livelihood so even if he really believes", "63:40", "it he still has this additional level of", "63:42", "motivation to not disprove things how", "63:46", "many people are in architects and", "63:47", "engineers for 9/11 truth no it depends", "63:49", "how you count it like they they say they", "63:52", "have like thousands of architects and", "63:53", "engineers actually signing the petition", "63:56", "I think they have like maybe a few", "64:00", "hundred working structural engineers", "64:04", "what do you think of their take on it", "64:07", "their take is kind of like the standard", "64:09", "of 9/11 truth they think that it's", "64:13", "controlled demolition and I think they", "64:14", "have all this evidence of a controlled", "64:16", "demolition but it's not very good", "64:18", "evidence is one of the", "64:21", "experts as a high school physics teacher", "64:25", "and he's probably good at high school", "64:28", "physics but he just makes some very", "64:30", "simple mistakes about physics of the the", "64:35", "falling towers and they repeat this on", "64:37", "their website unquestioningly there's", "64:40", "another guy who's like the expert on the", "64:43", "nano thermite residue that was found you", "64:46", "know they think that these red and grape", "64:48", "specks of what looks like paint and rust", "64:51", "was actually nano thermite since he's", "64:55", "now like an expert on their site he gets", "64:59", "to say whatever he likes and he's got", "65:00", "this one theory about how the bits of", "65:02", "steel that flew out of the building had", "65:04", "these nano thermite rockets attached to", "65:07", "them which is why they were leaving", "65:08", "these trails of smoke behind when they", "65:11", "fell down and these are things that are", "65:13", "just pretty ridiculous and you can kind", "65:16", "of debunk them with physics that they'll", "65:19", "have none of it because they've got", "65:20", "their experts saying something and you", "65:23", "can't you can't deny the fact that you", "65:27", "can't deny that you can't debunk their", "65:29", "experts because they're experts you know", "65:30", "why would you know more about a high", "65:31", "school physics teacher of our physics", "65:32", "why would you know more about nano", "65:34", "thermite then this guy who was an expert", "65:35", "in nano thermite mm-hmm so they've got", "65:38", "all this supposed expertise making these", "65:41", "mistakes about 911 like this here the", "65:45", "the precedent has this ridiculous", "65:48", "demonstration that he does where he", "65:49", "holds up two cardboard boxes underneath", "65:52", "one of them there's empty space", "65:53", "underneath the other one there's a tower", "65:55", "and he drops them and the this one falls", "65:58", "to the ground and this one bounces off", "65:59", "the cardboard box and he's basically", "66:01", "saying this is what should have happened", "66:03", "this upper portion should have stopped", "66:06", "on the way down and he's using these", "66:08", "cardboard boxes and as a demonstration", "66:10", "but the ridiculous oversimplifications", "66:13", "or what actually happened you know I", "66:16", "don't know too much about the engineers", "66:21", "take on things you know from architects", "66:23", "and engineers I'd really didn't bother", "66:25", "getting into it too much but I just do", "66:28", "know that it's several hundred people if", "66:31", "not over a thousand and they're all over", "66:33", "the world", "66:34", "but how many people have studied it that", "66:38", "disagree with them like how many and how", "66:41", "years that are in our canal OTT of", "66:44", "architects and a lot of engineers in", "66:46", "this world yeah that they recently tried", "66:48", "to get a motion passed at the American", "66:50", "Institute of Architects which was", "66:53", "basically a reopened World Trade Center", "66:55", "seven and they went to the convention", "66:58", "and they stood up and they gave their", "67:00", "speeches and okay they're all their", "67:02", "evidence about why you know will the", "67:05", "building seven investigation should have", "67:07", "been reopened and they took a vote and I", "67:10", "think it was about something like 97 so", "67:12", "3% against doing this so of the", "67:16", "architects who were actually there are", "67:18", "these professional architects 97 percent", "67:20", "I can't remember the exact figures but", "67:21", "it's around that voted against this so", "67:24", "even though there's even that there are", "67:26", "thousands of signatures to

he's like no people", "90:08", "don't believe the earth is flat so he", "90:11", "went from that to I don't think he's a", "90:14", "hundred percent convinced that it's flat", "90:15", "but he's definitely willing to listen", "90:17", "he's down the rabbit hole I think got", "90:19", "sucked in he loves it and it's probably", "90:20", "like a lot of it it's just from him", "90:22", "watching endless YouTube it's 100% what", "90:24", "it is here it is right here", "90:27", "and what's the worse that conspiracy day", "90:29", "like the worst one flat earth there's", "90:32", "people to know

idea is that", "91:48", "this this came from another planet we", "91:51", "actually came up with the name before", "91:52", "Pluto had been changed from you know", "91:56", "they did decided as a planetoid", "91:59", "downgraded it so we decided that this", "92:01", "jujitsu was coming from another planet", "92:03", "like out there where the Anunnaki live", "92:05", "but it was based on Zecharia Sitchin's", "92:07", "book the 12th planet and his book was", "92:10", "all about planet Nibiru and that the", "92:14", "Sumerian texts were when you when you", "92:17", "decipher them

"92:50", "that was a big one yeah Anunnaki type", "92:52", "thing like the ancient aliens is", "92:54", "something that's really at the far end", "92:56", "of the conspiracy spectrum but you still", "92:58", "get people who are like you know", "93:00", "chemtrail believers who believe it one", "93:02", "of the guys you interviewed Scott", "93:04", "Stevens there's a meteorologist yes yeah", "93:07", "he was like into like yeah he believed", "93:09", "chemtrails 100% yeah yeah he also", "93:11", "believed in aliens and then did he that", "93:13", "type of yeah I don't know key like a", "93:14", "wild something disbelieve in aliens what", "93:18", "I disbelieve is people that are in", "93:20", "contact with it rights yeah I think the", "93:22", "idea you know the Fermi paradox right", "93:24", "the the idea that there's so many", "93:25", "planets and so many galaxies and so many", "93:28", "solar systems that the odds of life", "93:30", "being out there so high why why have we", "93:33", "not been contacted that's interesting to", "93:35", "me it is entirely possible in my", "93:38", "estimation as a moron that we are the", "93:41", "most advanced life-form in the universe", "93:43", "it's entirely possible because we exist", "93:45", "because we are the most advanced", "93:47", "life-form on earth we know that right as", "93:51", "far as we know as far as like", "93:52", "communicating things that we've", "93:54", "discovered in 2017 we are the most", "93:56", "advanced it's entirely possible that", "93:57", "we're the most advanced everyone no one", "93:59", "has to be yes right it could be asked", "94:02", "yeah people say like you know we're the", "94:04", "odds but yeah what are the odds of us", "94:06", "the first person you know who ever wins", "94:08", "the lottery because by the odds but it", "94:10", "happened to that person's right it", "94:11", "doesn't mean that it's very unlikely", "94:12", "it's not like we run lots of universes", "94:14", "and see what happens well as also", "94:15", "there's a direct that one progression", "94:17", "that you could file like what are the", "94:18", "odds of someone inventing the iPhone 10", "94:20", "and 2017 well I don't know but that's", "94:24", "how long it took that's what happened", "94:25", "that is exactly what happened yeah this", "94:27", "is what we track it we can go back to", "94:30", "the iPhone one ten years ago it's real", "94:32", "simple", "94:32", "yeah people people use the arguments", "94:34", "like what is the probability right in", "94:36", "weird ways like people say what is the", "94:38", "probability of three planes falling from", "94:41", "two free--free buildings falling from", "94:43", "two planes hitting them as if that", "94:45", "argument actually makes any sense shitty", "94:47", "argument yeah but it brings up all the", "94:49", "time it's like what are the odds you who", "94:51", "get so lucky that you would have three", "94:52", "planes free buildings on the same day", "94:55", "yeah this doesn't make any sense no it", "94:57", "doesn't but say things like and but", "94:59", "again again it's to support confirmation", "95:01", "bias so I think that it's entirely", "95:04", "possible that we're the only advanced", "95:06", "life-form in the universe or it's", "95:08", "entirely possible that they're", "95:09", "incredibly advanced life forms that", "95:11", "really aren't interested in us yeah", "95:12", "we're in quarantined yeah yes that's", "95:15", "possible to look at our fucking", "95:17", "president and we have a whacky president", "95:18", "that just lies all the time", "95:20", "I mean fucking mine I think it perfectly", "95:23", "started crunching as a bit a bit earlier", "95:24", "them yeah but I mean what would you cut", "95:27", "what you would go these people don't", "95:27", "know the fuck they're doing we need to", "95:29", "figure out if they're gonna blow each", "95:31", "other up and pay close attention to them", "95:34", "see if they don't poison their water", "95:35", "like figure out what they're gonna do", "95:37", "first before we give them new technology", "95:40", "I think if this people if this thing's", "95:42", "out there it's probably machines well I", "95:45", "think it's you look at the advances in", "95:48", "AI and stuff was going on now I don't", "95:52", "think there's many civilizations can", "95:55", "really survive sink biological life has", "95:58", "its time yeah because you know you", "96:03", "people talk about like you know", "96:04", "Terminator and Skynet and things like", "96:05", "that and the robots taking over Cylons I", "96:07", "think that's actually a real problem I", "96:09", "think you know there are we've seen like", "96:12", "these robots oh yeah yeah they're pretty", "96:14", "crappy now but you've got to the stage", "96:16", "where they can do backflips and things", "96:18", "mm-hmm and not too much further along", "96:21", "the line like a hundred years from now", "96:25", "it's like a blink of the universe is I", "96:27", "will have robots that can do everything", "96:29", "that humans can do and more", "96:31", "absolutely so they're indistinguishable", "96:33", "to from sheep from people yeah and who", "96:35", "they choose to be and but not just", "96:37", "indistinguishable they will be humans", "96:40", "plus they'll be like gods yeah they were", "96:42", "way to do hundreds thousands or millions", "96:45", "of times more powerful than humans in", "96:47", "terms of their their processing power", "96:49", "and years hundreds of times more", "96:50", "powerful in terms of their strength and", "96:52", "that's a hundred years from now yeah", "96:53", "we're really close to that yeah it's", "96:55", "gonna be an explosive thing that there's", "96:57", "this thing in AI now called generative", "97:04", "adaptive networks which is this way of", "97:06", "doing AI where the robots special", "97:09", "basically teach themselves yeah one", "97:12", "robot who is judging things and there's", "97:14", "a one robot that's creating things and", "97:16", "the robot that's creating things teaches", "97:19", "the robot that's judging things how to", "97:21", "judge and the robots they're judging", "97:22", "things teachers they're creating robot", "97:24", "how to create and then they just go back", "97:26", "and forth back and forth so the old way", "97:28", "of doing AI was like you would teach a", "97:30", "robot to do things and you correct it", "97:31", "when it get wrong and you tweak the", "97:32", "algorithm but now you've got these", "97:34", "robots that are learning things", "97:35", "incredibly incredibly rapidly by", "97:37", "teaching themselves how to do things and", "97:39", "the humans who were running these robots", "97:42", "don't actually understand how this", "97:44", "actually works you end up with this huge", "97:47", "big matrix of numbers which you know one", "97:51", "can actually decipher but the results", "97:53", "come out of it they've got things like", "97:55", "now where you you can you can take a", "97:58", "scene in a video and you can turn night", "98:00", "in today or you can turn a snow scene", "98:02", "into a summer scene yeah because they", "98:04", "can near the robots the AI know how to", "98:07", "do these things and this issue the tip", "98:09", "of the iceberg there's so much more", "98:10", "coming down the line yeah I I saw", "98:13", "something that was incredibly disturbing", "98:14", "they said that when robots become", "98:18", "sentient like when they have the ability", "98:20", "to make up their own decisions and do", "98:22", "things for themselves and the first", "98:24", "thing you're going to do is improve on", "98:26", "their own design yeah and they'll", "98:28", "they'll we'll be able to have 10,000", "98:31", "years of human propel like if humans", "98:35", "were evolving technology a robot or a", "98:38", "sentient AI could do 10,000 years worth", "98:42", "of technological advancement in two", "98:44", "weeks yeah and is that real yeah because", "98:49", "computers just run so much faster just", "98:51", "think about that number", "98:52", "two weeks so think about how long ago", "98:55", "10,000 years ago was our civilization", "98:58", "it's probably a little bit optimistic in", "99:00", "terms of like actual physical", "99:01", "development because they can't make", "99:03", "prototypes fast enough to try them out", "99:05", "again they don't sleep and gone they", "99:07", "will they'll have these little robots", "99:08", "and enemy fire robot some can move so", "99:11", "much faster this axe some scientists are", "99:17", "saying that we should actually not we", "99:19", "should put the brakes on this AI a lot", "99:21", "of them right", "99:21", "but it's funny thing that seems like", "99:23", "we're like moving towards the edge of", "99:25", "the cliff and everyone's gone hey we", "99:26", "should probably hit the brakes soon it's", "99:28", "also such a lucrative thing for people", "99:29", "to do because if you get really good a I", "99:31", "you can you can sell it right yeah and", "99:33", "the army is gonna want robot soldiers", "99:36", "yeah you've got these these these drones", "99:38", "with guns mounted on them yeah if you", "99:41", "imagine you got like your dad scares the", "99:43", "shit out me what do you show me James I", "99:44", "open up a hit play it's really fast it's", "99:46", "sorting right back ripe tomatoes really", "99:50", "quick", "99:50", "it'll slow it down here in a second you", "99:53", "can see how fast whoa how can I see the", "99:56", "oh my god so it sees the green tomatoes", "99:58", "and it just knocks them out yeah yeah", "100:00", "what the fuck because the computer is", "100:03", "essentially seeing what we're seeing now", "100:04", "it's like hitting them so perfect", "100:07", "that's insane so as they're coming down", "100:10", "this ramp these computers are oh my god", "100:14", "that's in real time holy shit dude so", "100:17", "it's got this computer vision that's", "100:19", "processing it and because computers are", "100:21", "that fast enough to do this now oh my", "100:22", "god we're far it's just gonna get faster", "100:25", "it's so fucked that scares the shit out", "100:28", "of me more than the backflipping", "100:29", "robot but imagine the backflipping robot", "100:31", "can move it's really fast yeah well", "100:34", "that's what Ilana must said you won't be", "100:36", "able to see them even a strobe light", "100:39", "yeah and yeah they're gonna be like", "100:41", "super accurate shooting things you take", "100:43", "your eye out yeah they're not gonna have", "100:45", "any trigger panic robots god damnit so", "100:51", "that's that's real that's a real", "100:52", "conspiracy put down the chemtrails walk", "100:55", "away from the Flat Earth and understand", "100:57", "that there's sentient robots what did", "101:00", "you okay you you have a background in", "101:01", "computers what did you what was your", "101:04", "take on that whole thing when Google had", "101:07", "to shut down these two computers", "101:09", "communicating with each other because", "101:11", "they started talking in a language that", "101:13", "they didn't understand yeah I mean", "101:15", "that's what I was talking about there", "101:16", "with the generative adaptive networks", "101:18", "they they didn't have to shut them down", "101:23", "but they did you know a little freaked", "101:24", "out oh the shutting down because they", "101:26", "couldn't do anything with them right it", "101:29", "was the to do computers talking to each", "101:30", "other in gobbledygook so if it was", "101:32", "something interesting they were to cut", "101:33", "them and and start", "101:34", "but I think that they knew what the", "101:36", "computers are saying the computers knew", "101:38", "what they're saying to each other", "101:39", "no no it's just some kind of loop that", "101:41", "they got stuck in it wasn't

like", "108:10", "social media campaigns well don't they", "108:12", "say that's going on right now yeah but", "108:14", "they're not", "108:14", "they're not actually like have it's not", "108:18",

"108:50", "and I can have on social media right now", "108:52", "and people weren't we ought to tell the", "108:53", "difference there's this big famous test", "108:56", "in AI wish to the Turing test where the", "108:58", "test is someone sits in a room with a", "109:00", "typewriter and they talk to the computer", "109:02", "in the other room and if you can tell", "109:03", "it's a computer then it passes the", "109:06", "Turing test and it's meant to be", "109:07", "intelligent and they can't tell it's a", "109:09", "computer yeah we can tell it's a", "109:11", "computer yeah so there's been very", "109:13", "limited successes with that if you like", "109:15", "restrict the topics to just baseball or", "109:18", "Britney Spears or something I think they", "109:19", "have this very limited domains that they", "109:21", "can talk about but if you get a general", "109:23", "purpose AI that is actually intelligent", "109:25", "again and has goals to change someone's", "109:28", "mind about something like politics you", "109:31", "could have a real problem well we were", "109:33", "talking about Duncan and I yesterday", "109:35", "we're saying think about someone", "109:37", "creating an

wanted to take a podcast like", "109:49", "mine where there's a thousand episodes", "109:51", "and take those thousand plus episodes", "109:54", "and take my opinions and the way I", "109:57", "describe things the way I talk which I", "109:59", "mean like if you're talking to me in a", "110:01", "podcast like this you're just talking to", "110:03", "me this is what I talk like so and you", "110:05", "get a bunch of variables right you get", "110:06", "me excited me depressed me shocked me", "110:10", "sad me happy you would have so much to", "110:13", "choose from yeah you could look kinda", "110:15", "material you could kind of like fill in", "110:18", "the blanks and guess pretty accurately", "110:20", "how I would react or respond to certain", "110:23", "things one of the episodes of black Mira", "110:26", "British TV show Joe yeah was about some", "110:30", "woman whose husband had died but she had", "110:34", "all this video of him oh there was a", "110:35", "service that set up an AI version of him", "110:39", "and it starts out small like it's", "110:41", "someone who would post on social media", "110:43", "as him and eventually it grew to", "110:46", "business don't spoil alert me all right", "110:48", "I just watched an episode of the other", "110:50", "day it's a good Navin that one thank you", "110:53", "thank you so good I watched one the", "110:55",

"good that's a great show and come out a", "111:06", "couple weeks ah it's a good show good", "111:09", "good mrs. Rogan does not like it though", "111:10", "freaked out it is a bit I think she", "111:12", "hears too much that shit for me too you", "111:14", "know", "111:15", "she just gets freaked out on technology", "111:17", "in the future yeah the possibilities but", "111:20", "yeah like making a fake Jarek and it's", "111:21", "something that you know it's it's", "111:22", "possible - it's really easy right so now", "111:25", "you can probably do something if they", "111:26", "put enough resources in just yeah just", "111:28", "euro good yeah they could have something", "111:30", "because this type of you know the", "111:32", "generative productive generative", "111:33", "generative at the serial networks this", "111:36", "thing where they've got one judge and", "111:38", "one generator they'll have one AI that", "111:41", "just tries to make Joe Rogan's and then", "111:43", "they'll have another AI that an expert", "111:45", "are detecting the real Joe Rogan they", "111:47", "don't have all this real material to go", "111:49", "by and then this will keep feeding", "111:51", "things to this and you'll say oh that's", "111:52", "not quite right he doesn't say like that", "111:54", "he hears his eyes when he's confused and", "111:55", "Wow and eventually it will come up with", "111:59", "something that resembles you well then", "112:02", "it becomes a thing of like how do you", "112:05", "know you're you and how do you know", "112:08", "you're talking to someone else that's", "112:10", "them like here's the thing let's just", "112:14", "say why'd you leave this Robert dick -", "112:16", "sitting right here", "112:19", "Chris Ryan gave me a rubber dick sorry I", "112:22", "just noticed there they looked over how", "112:23", "to comment say let's say if say your", "112:28", "father died which is one of Ray", "112:30", "Kurzweil's big things his one of his", "112:34", "primary motivations is to recreate his", "112:37", "father he lost his father when he was", "112:39", "and he believes that through the advent", "112:41", "of artificial intelligence and through", "112:43", "the the data that he's collected or", "112:46", "recordings of his father and the images", "112:47", "that one day he will literally be able", "112:51", "to communicate with his father again I", "112:54", "don't know if that's real but I do know", "112:56", "that someone like Duncan say if my", "112:58", "friend Duncan died it's entirely", "113:00", "possible that within the next 50 years", "113:02", "they're gonna be able to create a", "113:05", "version of Duncan and Duncan can come", "113:07", "over and say hi dude I'm back hey crazy", "113:10", "I was dead and and I won't even know I", "113:13", "won't know if it's really Duncan you've", "113:15", "gotta watch this episode a black mirror", "113:16", "okay don't tell me no don't what is it", "113:20", "for - remember where I found this I", "113:21", "think it was an MPR episode might have", "113:23", "been on radio lab a thing called dad", "113:24", "bots mmm this guy made literally a text", "113:27", "he'd used all of his dad's past text", "113:29", "messages between himself and him and", "113:31", "then made a bot he could chat with I", "113:34", "think his brother can use it too yeah", "113:36", "they can just send generic messages like", "113:38", "hey how are you doing and he sends", "113:39", "something that he would have sent back I", "113:40", "mean oh he dad's like shut up faggot", "113:42", "he just says rude shit - nothing dad was", "113:48", "like you can probably tweak it a bit", "113:53", "though yeah everything is coming they're", "113:57", "like you know it's text now and it's not", "113:59", "it's not like very good you'd be able to", "114:01", "tell it's not a real person", "114:02", "did you like ex machina was that the", "114:06", "movie you never saw it oh yeah I did see", "114:09", "it but I've I forget he's very quickly", "114:13", "that's an amazing one it was it was a", "114:16", "plot real quick the plot was there was", "114:18", "like some surprise yeah somebody's in a", "114:21", "house super scientists and lived in the", "114:24", "middle of nowhere and they'd be flown", "114:25", "into him and he had created that guy", "114:27", "right there created an artificial", "114:28", "intelligence and they went over the", "114:29", "Turing test and everything in that -", "114:30", "it's my one of my favorite movies that's", "114:32", "per a small my top ten favorite movies", "114:34", "of all time it hits so close to home and", "114:36", "they were so little cut the shit in that", "114:38", "movie you know I described movies based", "114:40", "on the cut the shit scenes like some", "114:43", "movies like what fuck it she cut the", "114:45", "shit how'd that happen there was none of", "114:47", "that in that movie to me that in that", "114:49", "movie to me was like wow like this this", "114:52", "could take place let's pay there with", "114:54", "these you know these future robot things", "114:56", "there's so much of it is just trying to", "114:58", "make a robot that's just like a human", "114:59", "mm-hmm well you know the robots are not", "115:02", "gonna be like humans they're gonna be", "115:04", "like Cylons gonna be you know more than", "115:06", "humans yeah your command robots they're", "115:08", "doing work they're not gonna really look", "115:09", "like humans because it's not very", "115:10", "practical there will be robots that look", "115:12", "exactly like humans but that's just one", "115:13", "aspect of it right so there's gonna be", "115:15", "all kinds of much more impressive robots", "115:17", "well like think of that tomato robot", "115:19", "yeah it's knocking didn't have to look", "115:21", "like a person just has to be functioning", "115:22", "the way it for it to be functional is", "115:24", "not to look like a person", "115:25", "exactly it's to have these multiple", "115:27", "fingers I can knock away these green", "115:29", "tomatoes yeah like why build something", "115:32", "around the limitations of the human body", "115:33", "this is the same guy that isn't that", "115:35", "black mayor episode 2 do you think", "115:40", "they're gonna do a reboot or a sequel to", "115:44", "ex machina I had heard they were going", "115:46", "to sure why wouldn't I mean why wait man", "115:49", "fucking made a better who's a really", "115:51", "good movie made a bunch of money it was", "115:52", "amazing they better I am worried about", "115:56", "that", "115:56", "I am worried and I'm also worried that", "115:58", "by the fact that you know guys like Elon", "116:01", "Musk are worried that when someone like", "116:03", "that worries and starts talking about it", "116:05", "and yeah I'm like well who is paying", "116:07", "attention to this I mean how many people", "116:10", "are really at the forefront and is it", "116:11", "possible to pull that back because I'm", "116:13", "aware of what the United States is up to", "116:15", "in terms of like what gets printed in", "116:17", "the news obviously I'm not really aware", "116:18", "but when you get further than that like", "116:21", "China Russia like we don't we have no", "116:24", "idea what they're doing", "116:24", "yeah and they must be doing this type of", "116:26", "thing they must be and if you don't they", "116:28", "will take those things you know", "116:30", "something they don't need this huge", "116:32", "physical infrastructure they don't need", "116:35", "a big military or anything to do like", "116:36", "cyber warfare with AI fuck so they could", "116:40", "be developing all this artificial", "116:41", "intelligence to do things like in", "116:44", "infiltrate everybody's social media and", "116:46", "make them vote for the different guy", "116:48", "yeah or just infiltrate all our power", "116:51", "stations and shut them all down that's", "116:53", "one of the real problems that I have", "116:54", "today with the conversations regarding", "116:58", "politics regarding whether or not Russia", "117:00", "hacked the election is because people", "117:03", "are so concerned

the", "117:14", "interference and all the you know the", "117:17", "subterfuge is being used that we're I", "117:21", "think we're missing out on this idea", "117:23", "that you can electronically affect the", "117:27", "way people think about things if you", "117:30", "have enough resources to attack an idea", "117:35", "with propaganda through BOTS", "117:38", "yeah and this is something that you see", "117:40", "all the time yeah a lot of the stuff", "117:42", "that Russia did was posted in closed", "117:45", "groups on Facebook so it's something", "117:49", "that you really wouldn't be

murderer they can have you", "121:12", "outside murdering people and then put", "121:15", "that in the news and then by the time", "121:17", "they retract it you know they say oh my", "121:20", "quest

"121:47", "when they after they had fired those", "121:48", "reporters who had made these erroneous", "121:50", "connections and had this like flaw", "121:53", "ridden piece they fired them but the", "121:56", "story it already been written like this", "121:59", "is yeah I guess there's a rush to get", "122:01", "things out there and they're trying very", "122:03", "hard but you got to be very careful", "122:04", "because once something's out there that", "122:06", "initial thing of being out there is so", "122:08", "much more powerful than any retraction", "122:10", "yeah it's really hard to get retractions", "122:12", "out because the original thing just goes", "122:14", "so much more than the retraction yeah", "122:16", "especially if it's crazy by the Roy", "122:19", "Moore thing she's going on right now is", "122:21", "the election today there's a thing where", "122:24", "they said his signature was fake because", "122:27", "the ink on the image was like black on", "122:30", "one side and blue on the other side", "122:31", "mm-hmm and so they said oh this must", "122:33", "have been faked cuz this half the other", "122:35", "Roy is black and the Morrie's blue sir I", "122:38", "was looking into that and I did some", "122:40", "experiments where I did a signature and", "122:44", "then held it at an angle and took photos", "122:45", "of it and I found out that there's this", "122:47", "type of chromatic aberration from the", "122:49", "camera which just does that with ink", "122:51", "mm-hmm and it's very easy to duplicate", "122:54", "and you can show that this was actually", "122:55", "what was going on in this image and then", "122:57", "you can look at other images of the", "122:58", "signature from different angles which", "123:00", "show that it's all black so there's this", "123:02", "one image on CNN that showed this blue", "123:04", "and black ink and then I figured out", "123:08", "that it was just this trick of the", "123:10", "camera but even though it's been", "123:13", "debunked and explained this people are", "123:16", "still spreading the exact same thing", "123:18", "around right that's not real and that", "123:19", "can be a problem I could swing the", "123:21", "election", "123:21", "yeah and it's time limited that type of", "123:23", "thing like you know it's done today", "123:24", "after today doesn't really matter there", "123:26", "was also something about him writing", "123:29", "something in someone's yearbook yeah", "123:31", "that was the the yearbook thing right", "123:33", "was the decision the thing was they said", "123:35", "that the woman had forged the entry to", "123:38", "the yearbook but that's not the case", "123:39", "right", "123:40", "what she had done was written the date", "123:43", "and the note yes all the chicory house", "123:47", "yes but she didn't didn't Forge the", "123:51", "actual words", "123:52", "now she's but that's a that's a problem", "123:54", "the probably the problem is that she did", "123:56", "do it and she didn't say she did it as", "123:58", "so many people want that to be true that", "124:00", "it was forged right that if you can take", "124:02", "something with it's like you know it's", "124:04", "slightly problematic like her like not", "124:06", "saying that she actually added this", "124:08", "annotation afterwards yeah and then you", "124:10", "can say that the yeah she admitted to it", "124:12", "being forged right which is basically a", "124:14", "lie that's it it will stick for long", "124:18", "enough he doesn't really matter that", "124:19", "it's a lie because you know in you know", "124:22", "by the end of that today", "124:23", "he doesn't really matter at all so all", "124:25", "we had to do was get this story out", "124:26", "there he had enough stuff in it to make", "124:29", "it seem vaguely plausible to people who", "124:31", "wanted to believe that she forged it", "124:33", "did she Forge the date and did she try", "124:35", "to say that that date was was written by", "124:38", "him she I did a note underneath it had", "124:41", "the date but he had also written the", "124:43", "date above he wrote lighting it to a", "124:45", "sweeter more darling girl I could never", "124:47", "say Merry Christmas", "124:49", "Roy Moore 77 and then underneath she had", "124:53", "written Old Hickory house 1977 and did", "124:57", "she tried a claim that he had written", "124:59", "that originally it seemed like she was", "125:01", "saying that he'd written the whole thing", "125:03", "it and she she read out the inscription", "125:06", "and she said Roy Moore I wrote this in", "125:09", "my book blah blah blah blah blah and she", "125:10", "read the the annotation at the end was", "125:13", "the annotation at the end recent yeah at", "125:16", "nothing Kathy she says she wrote it like", "125:17", "afterwards like you know after she the", "125:22", "same day oh so how the fuck could she", "125:24", "even remember how do you remember what", "125:27", "you wrote down for in 1977 that the", "125:29", "handwriting is a bit different between", "125:30", "them yeah it was fairly obvious that it", "125:32", "wasn't the same the same handwriting", "125:34", "that's like her today trying to frame", "125:38", "him that seems more like she was just", "125:40", "documenting it at the time and forgot if", "125:43", "anything it makes it more realistic so", "125:44", "if she was in a forge it she would", "125:46", "afford to the whole thing what she's", "125:48", "talking about something forty years ago", "125:51", "yeah that's this this whole thing of", "125:54", "trying to like someone saying that this", "125:58", "definitely happened 40 years ago is to", "126:00", "me so bonkers how the hell could you and", "126:03", "this is a real problem with like the", "126:06", "news there you know like one of the Al", "126:08", "Franken accusers we were talking about", "126:10", "yesterday claimed that al had grabbed", "126:12", "her her waist and SQUOZE her fat in some", "126:15", "sort of way when did she's talking about", "126:17", "something 10 years ago like you", "126:19", "absolutely remember what happened in", "126:22", "something so inconsequential 10 years", "126:24", "ago that seems insane to me now you add", "126:27", "30 years on to that and I'm just calling", "126:29", "bullshit yeah you can't really remember", "126:31", "that level of detail I mean even if I", "126:35", "mean it would have to be something", "126:36", "really significant but even then you", "126:39", "know about Creative Memories", "126:41", "yeah people's memories change over time", "126:43", "yes a lot of people that claim they", "126:46", "remember where they were when they heard", "126:47", "about the Space Shuttle blowing up the", "126:49", "worst one yeah they're people done", "126:51", "extensive research into that like", "126:53", "tracking people's stories over like a", "126:55", "decade or so and they found that like a", "126:57", "significant percentage of people changed", "127:00", "their stories ten years later I'm sure", "127:02", "that's about where they were so like two", "127:04", "something you know like harassment or", "127:07", "something like that it's entirely", "127:08", "possible that the story could change", "127:09", "does false praise just possible that it", "127:12", "could change well it's just they're", "127:14", "they're conveniently forgetting or", "127:16", "ignoring that human memories insanely", "127:19", "flawed and malleable and I think part of", "127:22", "yeah that's why we have statute of", "127:24", "limitations because like things like", "127:26", "eyewitness testimony essentially", "127:27", "degrades over time that's one of the", "127:30", "things that I'm really hoping is going", "127:32", "to be cured with technology I'm hoping", "127:34", "we're gonna give up our bullshit", "127:36", "biological memory for a fat SD card they", "127:39", "stick in the back your head just pop", "127:42", "that sucker in there and click and", "127:44", "you'll have all of your memories", "127:46", "entirely accurate", "127:47", "like that was a black mirror because", "127:50", "motherfuckers are on top of everything", "127:52", "they know everything but I really think", "127:53", "that that's entirely possible in the", "127:55", "future that there's going to be some way", "127:56", "we have a neural interface with some", "127:59", "sort of a recording device it's far more", "128:02", "Act", "128:03", "and that we'll all agree to it well", "128:05", "agree to it just like photographs like", "128:08", "if Jamie is standing next to you and I", "128:12", "say Jamie and Mick west were in the room", "128:14", "together and take a picture it used to", "128:16", "be that I could say well that's definite", "128:18", "because I have this photo but now with", "128:20", "Photoshop and video editing tools so", "128:23", "even then so what am I talking about", "128:25", "because even then your memories are", "128:26", "gonna be able to create artificial", "128:28", "intelligence use your brain and creating", "128:30", "memories for you", "128:31", "well that wasn't that like Total Recall", "128:33", "right wasn't that part of the idea of", "128:35", "Total Recall they could put you put like", "128:38", "fake memories in your brain and have you", "128:41", "have fake experiences there's a lot of", "128:43", "experiences that I that were gigantic to", "128:46", "me like all of my years of martial arts", "128:49", "competition if you had asked me to like", "128:53", "accurately depict some of the most", "128:56", "significant memories of my life from", "128:57", "like age 16 to 21 like all those martial", "129:02", "arts fights that I had I wouldn't even", "129:04", "be able to touch it I have zero I've", "129:07", "scrapped I've like flashes yeah I'm", "129:10", "starting

"somebody's like 20 years ago but it's", "129:27", "that type of thing that I thought I", "129:28", "would never forget write that because it", "129:30", "was such a significant part of my life", "129:32", "but it's just kind of dropping away over", "129:35", "the years I think that happens a lot", "129:36", "with you know people are looking back on", "129:39", "9/11 and they're going by their memories", "129:41", "of what happened that day and it changes", "129:44", "you memory changes yeah IRA IRA there's", "129:46", "a few things that I remember because", "129:48", "they're like oh some significance to it", "129:51", "like I remember the Space Shuttle thing", "129:53", "because I was over at an ex-girlfriends", "129:57", "house and it was one of the few times", "129:58", "that we saw each other before we had", "130:01", "completely stopped seeing each other", "130:02", "like we had kind of broken up and then I", "130:04", "drove it out to her house to visit her", "130:06", "and

loads of like", "134:43", "Kickstarter's technology things that", "134:45", "just could never sadly work like these", "134:47", "like clear air Holograms they say you've", "134:49", "got to play video games on the table in", "134:51", "front of you oh yeah those fun Me's for", "134:54", "people that don't have illnesses that", "134:55", "yeah yeah there's like one with had a", "134:57", "water bottle all that would magically", "134:59", "take water out of the air I saw that one", "135:02", "yeah but it won't actually work it would", "135:04", "take like three days to fill the bottle",

ago", "135:55", "created it yeah a lot of these they're", "135:58", "like Eastern European like scientist", "136:00", "types who do things like this so they", "136:02", "made it look this dude is just driving", "136:04", "around and then there's this bar by", "136:06", "myself pull it out of air and then he", "136:09", "just pull it out of the tube and Wow", "136:11", "look I've got water all of a

fill up the reservoir right", "136:46", "so they're saying like a little water", "136:48", "bottle this size with a little solar", "136:50", "panel and this little condensing thing", "136:52", "that's this big will fill it up in", "136:54", "a few hours well maybe it's like that a", "136:56", "physically impossible physical face", "136:58", "technology swapping thing like 20 years", "137:01", "ago

yeah", "137:18", "there's I mean there's there's certainly", "137:19", "a lot of scams out there I don't know if", "137:21", "that's what he's doing when I talked to", "137:23", "people that knew him from a long time", "137:25", "ago he's been obsessed with UFOs forever", "137:28", "so his obsession seems to be legitimate", "137:30", "however when I was talking to him about", "137:32", "all the events and I was like tell me", "137:34", "what happened you got a guy contacted", "137:36", "you well I can't say Who I can't say I", "137:38", "can't say what it was I can't tell you", "137:40",

shiny", "138:07", "silver penis flying around and it was", "138:10", "actually something that a type of thing", "138:12", "we do on Medibank is identify objects", "138:14", "like that so we figured out what this", "138:15", "was and it's actually a number one", "138:18", "numerical helium balloon like the the", "138:21", "digit one oh wow like someone's like", "138:24", "from a party here and I found like a", "138:26", "bunch of other shots of the same thing", "138:28", "where you can see it rotating you can", "138:30", "see it's fairly clear it's it's number", "138:31", "one but it's on this this this", "138:34", "conspiracy website let's thought it was", "138:36", "a UFO so he got it off there and so this", "138:38", "is the UFO took the image kind of", "138:40", "degraded it a bit so you can't really", "138:41", "tell where it was it was quite hard for", "138:42", "me to track it down because it messed", "138:43", "with it so much it was actually just", "138:46", "this just helium balloon that was a", "138:48", "white it was no a shiny what's", "138:50", "disturbing to me is that he's got this", "138:53", "business that you know claims to be some", "138:56", "sort of aerospace business and he's", "138:58", "involved in it with all these other", "138:59", "people that's weird because the guy", "139:01", "who's running that kinda member's name", "139:03", "fortune or something like that", "139:05", "is it's like a real guy who worked at", "139:08", "Lockheed Martin or somewhere and the", "139:10", "skunkworks name we started doing", "139:11", "adderall started getting crazy what he's", "139:15", "talking about it makes no sense", "139:16", "whatsoever he says our mission is to", "139:18", "take what the Science Division gives us", "139:20", "and we'll turn that science into flying", "139:22", "craft right but the science division", "139:25", "does it doesn't really exist right", "139:27", "they've got like a guy who's like one", "139:29", "guy who was interested in like shooting", "139:31", "things with lasers to make them go fast", "139:34", "yeah that was one of the weird things", "139:36", "yeah it's kind of a real technology you", "139:38", "can use a laser to power power a craft", "139:41", "yeah that's not what they're talking", "139:42", "about they're talking about some kind of", "139:43", "crap that warps the very nature of time", "139:46", "and space itself yeah and kind of like", "139:49", "write rides a wave of a wormhole or", "139:52", "something like that yeah and this guy", "139:54", "thinks that it's plausible and all they", "139:56", "have to do is kind of like try really", "139:58", "really hard if the old put their heads", "139:59", "together and like this scientists do all", "140:01", "this science a lot and then these", "140:03", "builders do they're really good building", "140:05", "based on these really good science", "140:06", "they're gonna get then they'll they'll", "140:08", "get this flying craft yeah it's nonsense", "140:10", "no it's gonna happen Hasson having", "140:12", "people donated some something like two", "140:15", "million dollars goofy yes no how many", "140:17", "fucking people have done that see if we", "140:20", "can find that out two thousand two two", "140:23", "thousand ninety two people of donate", "140:24", "over two million dollars Wow so a", "140:27", "thousand dollars each that's a lie rich", "140:28", "that seems wrong I know that I'm the", "140:31", "numbers have changed frequently well the", "140:34", "numbers seemed really high in terms of", "140:36", "the amount of donations like it's very", "140:38", "odd you're gonna get 2,000 people to", "140:40", "donate a thousand dollars each that", "140:42", "doesn't seem right", "140:43", "it could be a few very large donors they", "140:45", "somehow convinced to donate via this", "140:48", "there are a lot of really fucking crazy", "140:51", "old people that believe in this shit and", "140:54",

"141:07", "kills me what kind of arts we doing", "141:09", "fingerprint always tracking those", "141:10", "numbers for a while never going up on", "141:12", "proportionately if that's the correct", "141:14", "word to say from each other the number", "141:17", "was going up while the", "141:18", "the dollar number was sort of staying", "141:20", "the same so maybe he was calling these", "141:22", "people if you double your off getting a", "141:24", "lot of smoke get you on the first ship", "141:26", "it's a minimum of 200 I think really", "141:29", "yeah a small small print down there so", "141:32", "some large donations", "141:34", "it's amazing knowledge donated two", "141:37", "million dollars to this wacky ass", "141:40", "fucking company yeah and only all the", "141:42", "company is required to do is paid along", "141:45", "a hundred thousand dollars a year for", "141:48", "the next seven years or something and", "141:51", "that's it really the crazy thing too was", "141:53", "that they he had been contacted by the", "141:56", "government because they knew that he", "141:57", "could go on shows like mine and talk", "142:00", "about this then he would have a platform", "142:01", "because he's a rockstar I was like what", "142:04", "this is like some why didn't and stop", "142:08", "him yeah this is like some bad movie", "142:10", "shit like this narrative is like a bad", "142:13", "movie is that people like say like they", "142:15", "don't want to talk to me on the phone", "142:16", "because they're afraid of the government", "142:17", "tracking them down and assassinating", "142:19", "them or or whatever it's like yeah I'm", "142:23", "talking to you on Facebook well yeah if", "142:27", "I really was like this you know agents", "142:29", "of the government it wouldn't be very", "142:31", "hard to just say yeah get rid of this", "142:33", "guy that's a big one they like to pull", "142:34", "on you because you debunk things you're", "142:36", "an agent of the government yeah yeah and", "142:39", "it's really hard one to get around I", "142:41", "think my approach there is just to be as", "142:43", "honest as possible all the time so I", "142:45", "also tell them exactly who I am like", "142:47", "that I made lots of money doing the Tony", "142:49", "Hawk video games I'm just like British", "142:50", "video game programmer and basically keep", "142:53", "my life story", "142:54", "yeah they don't buy it they don't buying", "142:57", "it pal they don't but yeah I think some", "142:59", "of them it helps telling them about", "143:01", "about Tony Hawk yeah it's a lot of them", "143:04", "actually a fans of turning off that's", "143:07", "funny actually well it's it's one of", "143:10", "those things where if you don't want to", "143:12", "believe you're not going to you know", "143:14", "like that's a likely cover story for a", "143:16", "guy and then then they'll go super deep", "143:18", "though the government is infiltrated", "143:19", "video games in order to keep kids stupid", "143:22", "they've created these games in order to", "143:23", "mess with the kids minds and one", "143:26", "reaction I get quite a bit is that I am", "143:28", "stupid that yours do", "143:29", "yeah a lot of people will say that I am", "143:31", "really stupid", "143:32", "there's there's people like who were in", "143:34", "like you know the architects and", "143:35", "engineers for 9/11 truth type thing who", "143:38", "think that I'm really stupid and don't", "143:39", "understand physics at all and so that", "143:42", "they say that the but I'm not a", "143:44", "government agent I'm just this really", "143:46", "stupid dude who doesn't understand what", "143:48", "actually happened on 9/11 useful idiot", "143:50", "right yeah and not just a new useful", "143:53", "idiot in that sense but a person who is", "143:57", "just mistaken right so then they can", "144:00", "dismiss my videos by laughing at them", "144:01", "break I do lots of little videos where I", "144:04", "do things like demonstrate how something", "144:06", "buckles like a column buckling when you", "144:09", "put a load on you could write or you", "144:12", "think things like that just just physics", "144:13", "videos and then they just say yeah", "144:15", "you're an idiot we don't need to look at", "144:17", "this video this is a way of getting", "144:19", "round the problem and a lot of other", "144:22", "people say that I'm so smart about", "144:23", "chemtrails and things like that that I", "144:25", "must be a government agent because I", "144:26", "know so much about contrails so I get", "144:28", "both sides of and why they're really", "144:30", "smart government agent or I'm just a", "144:32", "stupid useful idiot well it's just them", "144:35", "looking at you and trying to find some", "144:36", "way to dismiss what you're saying but", "144:38", "you you really get a kick out of", "144:40", "debunking shit I do it's fun like in the", "144:44", "backyard science stuff there was a thing", "144:46", "I did recently where yes some of the", "144:49", "scientists were saying that the bits", "144:51", "falling off the World Trade Center were", "144:52", "leaving trails that must be from the", "144:54", "rocket motors that are pushing them away", "144:56", "from the World Trade Center so I said no", "144:58", "it's probably just some dust on it and", "145:01", "they say no I wouldn't do that he", "145:02", "wouldn't leave a long trail so I got a", "145:04", "big sledgehammer and I piled some some", "145:06", "ashes on it from my fireplace and then I", "145:08", "stood on top of a wall and I was", "145:10", "throwing this sledgehammer with a big", "145:12", "trail of dust coming from it for like", "145:14", "half an hour videoing myself doing it", "145:16", "until I got something that some", "145:17", "representative videos of it it's just", "145:19", "fun to do it is kind of fun you know one", "145:22", "of the ones that kept coming up that I", "145:24", "thought was the most ridiculous one", "145:25", "about the Flat Earth was I had read this", "145:28", "a couple places where people were", "145:29", "talking about ships disappearing on the", "145:31", "horizon yeah and then the ship", "145:33", "disappeared but if you pulled out if you", "145:35", "do this you zoom and you could still see", "145:37", "the ship yeah and I was like well how", "145:39", "come you can't see Mount Everest", "145:40", "motherfucker why can't you look towards", "145:42", "Japan where's Mount Kilimanjaro get up", "145:45", "how come you can see the moon you can", "145:47", "see the moon and if you get a good", "145:48", "telescope you can see the moon really", "145:49", "clearly take that telescope don't point", "145:51", "at the moon point across the ocean", "145:53", "where's the mountains see you know", "145:55", "atmosphere yeah that's the the kind of", "145:59", "advanced version you know I was talking", "146:01", "about Howard not architects and", "146:02", "engineers for 9/11 have to do this", "146:03", "really advanced thing that because we've", "146:05", "debunked the basic stuff so they're", "146:07", "moving this advanced stuff", "146:08", "same thing with flood earth people now", "146:11", "they can you demonstrate how things", "146:13", "actually do go over the horizon and", "146:15", "writers do get obscured by the horizon", "146:17", "and you have a sunsets and things like", "146:19", "that and so they come up with a", "146:20", "complicated explanation where there's", "146:22", "this kind of giant refractive lens of", "146:25", "atmosphere above the earth which is", "146:28", "bending all the light from the Sun in", "146:30", "such a way that the earth appears to be", "146:33", "round even though it's actually flat it", "146:38", "kind of begs the question like how do", "146:39", "they actually know it's round if it", "146:41", "looks how do they know it's flat if it", "146:43", "looks round right so they've got like", "146:45", "yeah things are disappearing over the", "146:47", "horizon as if it looks round because of", "146:50", "this refraction thing hmm but they think", "146:53", "it's flat but if it looks round why are", "146:56", "they thinking it's planet well the thing", "146:59", "that killed me was that you could zoom", "147:00", "in on it and that proved that the that", "147:03", "it wasn't actually disappearing over the", "147:04", "horizon I know a little bit about optics", "147:08", "because of my fascination with the", "147:11", "outdoors I have a bunch of binoculars", "147:13", "spotting scopes various power and", "147:16", "there's things you just cannot see but", "147:19", "then you get a good spotting scope on", "147:20", "them so with the naked eye like there's", "147:23", "things you can't see with the naked eye", "147:24", "you would swear they do not exist", "147:26", "they're not there but then you get a", "147:28", "great spotting scope on them and you can", "147:29", "see it miles away and that's the thing", "147:32", "with ships you get a large ship it goes", "147:34", "far enough away you can't see it anymore", "147:37", "and you'll be convinced that it's", "147:38", "disappeared over the horizon when in", "147:40", "fact it's only probably a couple inches", "147:43", "lower on the horizon as far as like the", "147:46", "curve of the earth but to the naked eye", "147:48", "it's invisible yeah so when they zoom in", "147:50", "on it they're convinced that aha there", "147:53", "is no curvature of the earth see this", "147:54", "looked like it went over the horizon but", "147:56", "it's an optical illusion", "147:58", "yeah the thinkers that have been shown", "147:59", "this so many times exist actually", "148:00", "happens there's so many videos now on", "148:02", "YouTube that actually demonstrate this", "148:05", "thing like this time lapses of ships", "148:06", "going over the horizon like zooming all", "148:08", "the way with them that p900 cameras", "148:11", "which do like 83 times zoom as big as", "148:14", "you can go yeah it's been demonstrated", "148:16", "yes they just ignore it or they say it's", "148:18", "okay", "148:18", "they ignore it because it's not in their", "148:20", "same YouTube cue", "148:21", "you know if you look at the the you know", "148:23", "you play in the Flat Earth video all it", "148:25", "Q to the right is like Flat Earth", "148:26", "exposed yeah some of those get hundreds", "148:30", "of thousands of views this is one guy", "148:31", "dr. Zak who's where he it's like a", "148:34", "foreign guy who does the ocean yeah he", "148:37", "does these these Flat Earth videos and", "148:40", "they're all mathematically showing", "148:41", "things in AutoCAD with drawing lines and", "148:44", "stuff and he gets like 400,000 views", "148:46", "it's amazing it's bizarre well it's just", "148:48", "amazing that so many people get get into", "148:51", "this and they buy into it do you see", "148:52", "that one with that young man took a", "148:54", "spirit ruler a spirit level on an", "148:57", "airplane yes fly around airplanes Darryl", "149:01", "Martin the guy's name he lives in a van", "149:04", "does he yeah he has a bunch of videos on", "149:06", "van life he's a cool guy he's a very", "149:09", "nice guy but he's got this weird idea", "149:11", "about the Flat Earth it's so like I've", "149:13", "had a few like youtube battles with him", "149:15", "about where like he puts up something", "149:18", "about how the the moon is cooling things", "149:22", "and he has this thermometer thing", "149:24", "showing that the moon is actually making", "149:27", "things cold then I put up a video", "149:29", "explaining why you know it's just a", "149:31", "reflection because these infrared", "149:33", "thermometers don't work that way and", "149:35", "then he puts another thing like debug", "149:37", "this Mik West like I gave up at that", "149:40", "point was a very short battle well the", "149:43", "weird thing is that they see all these", "149:45", "other planets as round but they decide", "149:47", "that the earth is flat that it's some", "149:49", "sort of a flat disk yeah they think it's", "149:51", "that different yes there's I just like", "149:54", "these tiny little bowls that are like", "149:56", "two miles wide of something and they", "149:58", "think the earth is really close to the", "149:59", "Sun yeah they think it's about 4,000", "150:02", "miles away some think it's 34 miles away", "150:05", "oh you fucking idiots", "150:10", "but they think they think the distance", "150:11", "to the Sun varies depending on the", "150:13", "observer okay observer dependent Oh like", "150:17", "where you are yeah if it's only four", "150:19", "miles away imagine if every drive away", "150:21", "just gets super small like what the fuck", "150:24", "yeah I mean it makes no sense it's so", "150:26", "ridiculous but it's just to me it's such", "150:29", "a strange thing to concentrate on that", "150:31", "this is like their their identity is", "150:34", "wholly invested in improving this thing", "150:37", "to be some sort of a massive conspiracy", "150:39", "in a very very very strange it's love it", "150:43", "you love it they love it you love it do", "150:45", "you love debunking that's the thing it's", "150:46", "like it's it's a rabbit hole for", "150:49", "debunkers yeah there's a flat earth you", "150:51", "just get sucked into it it's one of the", "150:52", "best ones because it's so silly it is", "150:55", "there's no and then here's the thing", "150:56", "that people send me people like I don't", "150:59", "know if they're trolling me or if", "151:00", "they're serious they'll send me a", "151:01", "picture of a glacier and I go there's", "151:04", "your fucking your ice wall yeah they", "151:07", "show you that the Ross Ice Shelf or", "151:08", "something like that like an actual ice", "151:10", "shelf yeah on top to go yeah you can", "151:12", "look up that the pitch and see what it", "151:14", "actually well and they think this is a", "151:15", "government the government is like", "151:17", "guarding the the ice wall all around so", "151:20", "you can't get near it take pictures of", "151:22", "it yeah the southern hemisphere is a", "151:25", "huge problem for the flood earthers yeah", "151:28", "because you can you can have like", "151:29", "somebody standing on like the south of", "151:31", "South America someone in Australia and", "151:33", "they're both looking south which on a", "151:34", "disc would be away right looking", "151:36", "completely different directions and the", "151:37", "both actually yeah because they're both", "151:39", "fairly close to each other early they're", "151:41", "looking at the same stars in the sky", "151:42", "yeah and there's there's even like", "151:45", "they're really complicated explanations", "151:46", "for the Flat Earth", "151:47", "don't explain that so that's like one of", "151:49", "the the hard irrefutable proofs of", "151:53", "around Earth well he also is a son", "151:55", "constable they keep changing their story", "151:57", "based on what gets debunked like the big", "152:01", "one that Dube was saying forever every", "152:03", "photograph of Earth from space is a", "152:05", "composite well that's not true", "152:07", "they have full scale full image", "152:12", "high-resolution photographs from the", "152:14", "Himawari 8 yeah those are fake then they", "152:16", "decided that those are fake so first it", "152:18", "was the", "152:19", "they're composites yeah you know which", "152:22", "there was some composites from lower", "152:23", "satellites and then blue marble things", "152:26", "that's how that got started is the", "152:27", "famous issue of the famous image of the", "152:30", "blue marble hmm", "152:31", "which is a NASA very high-resolution", "152:33", "image that they did back in like the 90s", "152:36", "from composites because they wanted to", "152:38", "get something which had all of the land", "152:40", "mass without any clouds on right so they", "152:42", "had to take loads and loads of pictures", "152:43", "and just take the bits that had no", "152:45", "clouds on and then stitch them all", "152:46", "together right and then they created", "152:47", "this thing and then they did a separate", "152:49", "one that had just the clouds and then", "152:51", "they could put them together and move", "152:52", "them around and stuff how many different", "152:53", "satellites are taking full Earth images", "152:56", "probably around 30 or 40 long how many", "153:00", "of those are run by government chills", "153:02", "they're all run by government", "153:06", "well Himawari eight is the Japanese one", "153:09", "yeah that's a Russian one which is about", "153:11", "the same as such a two Russian ones", "153:13", "there's a European one meteos at the", "153:18", "american high resolution one just went", "153:21", "up a few months ago it's offline at the", "153:24", "moment cuz they're moving it from one", "153:26", "side of the United States to the other", "153:28", "mmm damn they're moving it how long does", "153:30", "that take a few days Jesus now yeah how", "153:35", "the fuck we do that little little Jets", "153:38", "oh yeah yeah you've seen gravity yeah", "153:41", "that's how things move around it got", "153:43", "things moving that was the direction and", "153:45", "then sending them there anchor it that's", "153:47", "part that is something that confuses", "153:48", "people is how do Rockets work in space", "153:51", "mmm they think that because there's no", "153:53", "atmosphere in space there's nothing to", "153:55", "push against right so how does a rocket", "153:58", "actually work in space how does it its", "154:01", "action and reaction if you throw", "154:03", "something in that's this direction you", "154:06", "will move in the opposite direction I", "154:07", "say if you sit in your chair take a big", "154:10", "bowling ball or something throw it in", "154:11", "that direction really fast you'll move", "154:13", "it back a bit right so if you get like", "154:15", "an air hose and you pointed it in that", "154:18", "direction and you're standing on ice or", "154:20", "something you're moving the opposite", "154:21", "direction it doesn't matter if there's", "154:23", "air it's you throw something that way", "154:25", "there has to be a reaction in the", "154:27", "opposite direction okay that makes sense", "154:30", "a lot of those guys don't even believe", "154:31", "in satellites", "154:33", "because how could they they think that", "154:36", "they think that signals are bounced off", "154:38", "the ionosphere", "154:39", "there's no satellite yeah but you can", "154:41", "you can see this out of lives yeah you", "154:44", "can see you can see the station yeah you", "154:46", "can see it fly overhead and I get emails", "154:49", "whenever it's gonna fly overhead I go", "154:50", "out and have a look and you can see I've", "154:52", "taken pictures of it you can see the", "154:53", "solar panels in the photographs that", "154:54", "I've taken Wow and it always appears", "154:57", "exactly where NASA says it's going to", "154:59", "appear nowhere in the world that's here", "155:01", "the problem with these people that don't", "155:04", "believe in satellites is that how are we", "155:06", "tracking the weather then how do we know", "155:08", "exactly when the Hurricanes are coming", "155:09", "in yeah weather balloons yeah it's it's", "155:17", "my concern about all this in particular", "155:20", "like the flatter stuff is young kids", "155:23", "wasting their time on stupid shit when", "155:26", "the world is filled with massive real", "155:29", "mysteries and incredibly fascinating", "155:32", "things you should be diving in and", "155:34", "learning about I think there's a great", "155:36", "opportunity for teaching kids with", "155:38", "things like flat earth yes you can do", "155:40", "real experiments to determine that the", "155:43", "earth is not flat also maybe even more", "155:47", "importantly teaching them about traps", "155:49", "thinking trap yes they the mind can", "155:52", "allow you to go down you can teach them", "155:54", "how to debug yes a this guy is saying", "155:57", "that ships should reappear when we zoom", "155:59", "in how do we test this right and then", "156:01", "they can go out and tested it yeah well", "156:04", "that that's that was that one was so", "156:06", "stunningly stupid to me", "156:07", "and then I don't want to go into the", "156:11", "flatterer thing anymore but it's the the", "156:13", "thinking behind it that's the problem", "156:15", "the thinking that every single airline", "156:18", "pilot everyone involved in commercial", "156:23", "shipping everyone involved in aerospace", "156:26", "everyone who makes satellites everyone", "156:28", "all those people are lying every", "156:30", "cartographer everyone all the map makers", "156:33", "everyone they're all full of shit", "156:34", "everyone has agreed to not tell everyone", "156:37", "else about the ice wall if the earth was", "156:40", "flat there was an ice wall scientists", "156:42", "would detail it and they would explain", "156:43", "why the earth was flat and they would", "156:45", "show you a working", "156:46", "model of the earth being flat and that's", "156:48", "what they would teach in school there", "156:50", "would be no there's no benefit", "156:52", "whatsoever to describing the earth in a", "156:55", "shape that it doesn't exist in and it", "156:58", "would be obvious that the earth was flat", "156:59", "because you have to do like really", "157:01", "simple tests yourself you can see boats", "157:03", "not going over their horizon it's just", "157:06", "so disturbing you would see the Sun get", "157:08", "smaller as it gets further away yeah the", "157:10", "Sun stays exactly the same size", "157:12", "throughout the day yeah", "157:13", "sunrise noon sunset all exactly the same", "157:16", "size the moon does the same thing why", "157:18", "does the moon look so much bigger though", "157:19", "when it's on the horizon without optical", "157:22", "illusion what is it it's a perspective", "157:23", "issue yeah it's just yeah it's just like", "157:25", "just the way your brain works it you", "157:27", "take photographs of it like on the", "157:29", "horizon and then another photograph of", "157:31", "it when it's right up there and compare", "157:32", "them side by side if you're the same", "157:33", "same zoom settings it's exactly the same", "157:35", "that's interesting because it really", "157:37", "does look larger when it gets lower it's", "157:39", "purely psychological mmm the Harvest", "157:42", "Moon right yeah", "157:45", "what is the Harvest Moon not that big a", "157:47", "red moon or something", "157:49", "that's the Blood Moon that's then", "157:51", "Eclipse had the beaver moon to the Eva", "157:54", "moon forgave him it was a big one I", "157:57", "didn't know about a beaver moon I did", "157:59", "until they said it was the super moon", "158:00", "which is when the the moon is just very", "158:04", "close to you what is the super moon how", "158:06", "much closer is a super moon it's not", "158:08", "much closer really the it actually only", "158:11", "gets about 8% bigger than its smallest", "158:14", "it's actually very hard to see that it's", "158:16", "actually any big a people side by side", "158:18", "that's a lot though but people yeah yeah", "158:21", "you see these new stories about super", "158:23", "moon go look at the super moon tonight", "158:24", "mm-hmm well it's it's not that much", "158:28", "difference oh wow that looks a little", "158:30", "bit different that's the very smallest", "158:32", "moon and the very largest moon most of", "158:34", "the time it's gonna be somewhere in", "158:35", "between that so you're not really gonna", "158:36", "notice the difference mm-hmm all right", "158:39", "anything else we should cover before we", "158:41", "wrap this up yeah let me look at my list", "158:45", "I have to write list because my memory", "158:47", "is so bad now I've offloaded everything", "158:51", "like you know you're a stand-up", "158:52", "comedians that you could have mail to", "158:53", "memorize all this stuff well not only", "158:55", "that I have to memorize fights too", "158:57", "of UFC information in my head and I have", "159:00", "comedy information my head but if you", "159:03", "ask me to do my act that I did from last", "159:05", "year right like that I filmed for my", "159:08", "Netflix special I wouldn't be able to do", "159:10", "it", "159:10", "you know looking at my listen we've kind", "159:12", "of covered for me and most of the things", "159:14", "they're on here we could go over some", "159:15", "like 911 crap if you wanted to but think", "159:20", "about it this stage of my life it's it", "159:22", "seems when there's so many incredible", "159:25", "things to pay attention to that are real", "159:28", "you know I know this is what I feel like", "159:30", "about all this stuff where people are", "159:32", "looking into conspiracies that there's", "159:34", "just nonsense it's like you chase", "159:35", "they're chasing their tail they're", "159:37", "trying to confirm something where", "159:40", "there's so much evidence that it's not", "159:41", "real that it just it really bothers me", "159:44", "it drives me nuts and I just don't", "159:46", "understand it and I don't I just I wish", "159:49", "that it wasn't a problem I wish it", "159:51", "wasn't an issue mm-hmm you know and it", "159:53", "is and it's one of the reasons why I", "159:54", "continue to talk about these things and", "159:57", "I really want to shine as much light on", "159:59", "them as possible so that there's there's", "160:02", "a real pattern that you could fall into", "160:04", "and you can waste a tremendous amount of", "160:07", "time in your life if you start looking", "160:09", "at things yeah incorrectly and Flat", "160:12", "Earth to me is the best example of it", "160:14", "it's the best example because it's so", "160:16", "stupid", "160:17", "I mean it's so utterly preposterous that", "160:20", "everyone is lying and that there are no", "160:22", "images at all of this Flat Earth but yet", "160:25", "this one guy or a couple guys and I had", "160:27", "heard that it it started all out as a as", "160:30", "a troll on 4chan is that they they had", "160:33", "started doing this like way back in you", "160:35", "know like it could have been but the", "160:37", "flood I think goes back to the agent", "160:38", "right but the people look like reignited", "160:41", "it yeah yeah just using that as a like", "160:43", "you know shit posting when we talk about", "160:44", "shit posting that people have always", "160:47", "believed in the flight oh yeah yeah", "160:50", "alright let's wrap it up my quest so", "160:52", "meta bunk comm if anybody wants to go", "160:55", "though org my upcoming book escaping
