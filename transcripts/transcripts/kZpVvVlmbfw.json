"07:04", "gonna be real hard and then obviously I", "07:06", "could demand that Connors like one of", "07:08", "the only guys that can get that kind of", "07:10", "money he's the only guys do you think", "07:12", "eventually guys will just start doing I", "07:14", "think it's so big like Connor he just", "07:16", "does his own show and he gets his own", "07:18", "people know you'll see lawyers are too", "07:19", "good to let you get out of your contract", "07:21", "that if Nate had a legit fight with", "07:26", "someone other than Connor that was", "07:27", "exciting the problem is there's no one", "07:29", "else in the division that's got that", "07:31", "kind of marquee value at 55 yeah there's", "07:33", "no one in the division that has the kind", "07:35", "of marquee value that if you had a look", "07:37", "I think Nate is a fucking huge star", "07:39", "but in lesson especially now I mean", "07:41", "after he beat Connor he's one of the", "07:42", "biggest stars outside of
