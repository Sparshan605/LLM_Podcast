the fuck", "51:09", "out I was reading and wired there's some", "51:11", "insane amount of time for like every", "51:13", "frame for as far as like rendering some", "51:17", "like seven-hour fucking time for each", "51:19", "frame to render is that insane which", "51:22", "movie doe this can't be a Pixar man oh", "51:25", "really", "51:25", "yeah that's crazy hmm bit illegal that", "51:29",

know what you're", "52:23", "going to be able to edit and and how", "52:24", "fast is it going to render you know push", "52:27", "it together it's that easy 20 years ago", "52:28", "science fiction right 20 years ago", "52:31", "science fiction 30 years ago super crazy", "52:34", "science fiction that's like ridiculous", "52:36", "you're taught you're talking about", "52:38", "something that's just like people would", "52:39", "look at in the movies and go wow", "52:41", "you know like Minority Report type shit", "52:44", "yeah but they make it look like you can", "52:45", "do it now but it really it's not gonna", "52:46", "exist for another hundred years or so", "52:48", "what did you say how many hours I think", "52:50", "they said 7:00 yet that's what they just", "52:52", "seven hours right at seven hours here", "52:53", "seven hours per pixel yeah yeah what the", "52:55", "fuck man and nights like this that's", "52:57", "like a supercomputer - right don't think", "52:59", "he's like a so I'm sure they use yeah a", "53:00", "huge cloud of computers definitely", "53:03", "that's ridiculous", "53:04", "those movies took a lot of fucking time", "53:06", "but goddamn they're cool as fuck so", "53:08", "seven seven hours now so in ten years", "53:11", "that means we could do Pixar movies on", "53:14", "our phone oh yeah yeah that's inevitable", "53:17", "right it's gonna be awesome hey dude", "53:19", "check out Toy Story 80 huh if they don't", "53:21", "break the universe before then add all", "53:24", "right that's my latest theory the human", "53:27", "beings create the Big Bang I've been", "53:29", "talking about on that stage I think", "53:31", "that's what we're doing I think that's", "53:32", "what I think that's why the big I think", "53:34", "14 14 billion years ago plus was the Big", "53:37", "Bang I think was a lonely dude in his", "53:39", "basement figured out a way to break the", "53:40", "universe and he had a switch and he", "53:42", "wanted to see what happened they clicked", "53:43", "it and the whole thing to enjoy yeah I", "53:47", "think that's what happens and then and", "53:50", "then you know people get curious and we", "53:52", "developed to a certain point in time", "53:53", "where we repeat the process isn't that", "53:58", "possible I mean nobody knows what the", "54:00", "fuck created the Big Bang right but when", "54:02", "you see scientists working on shit like", "54:04", "the Large Hadron Collider Large Hadron", "54:07", "Collider is this crazy experiment that", "54:09", "they're participating right now in", "54:10", "Europe where they've got this 22", "54:13", "kilometer long machine and it spins", "54:16", "these atoms around and collides them", "54:19", "it's just just slightly slower than the", "54:20", "speed of light and they're trying to", "54:22", "recreate a thing called the Higgs boson", "54:24", "particle now they believe there's", "54:25", "actually five different Higgs boson", "54:28", "particles or trying to figure out like", "54:29", "what what existed they call the god", "54:32", "particle for lack of a better word and", "54:34", "it's what existed just a millisecond you", "54:37", "know a fraction of a millisecond even", "54:39", "right after the Big Bang so when they", "54:42", "get that when they figure out how to do", "54:43", "that and if they do recreate the Higgs", "54:45", "boss and if they do really you know find", "54:47", "out it's not just a theoretical particle", "54:49", "but it's real when they do that they're", "54:50", "not going to stop there but I have to", "54:52", "stop there they're going to keep going", "54:53", "they're going out what's the next thing", "54:55", "this is", "54:55", "they got 10,000 scientists working on", "54:57", "that this is the biggest project in", "54:59", "scientific history and it has nothing to", "55:01", "do with making our lives better", "55:04", "technology at one point in time was all", "55:06", "about making your life better technology", "55:08", "was about you know hey we need to get", "55:10", "water and we don't want to you know just", "55:12", "have to drink it out of the river every", "55:13", "time we we need to get it and bring it", "55:15", "back to camp what do we do we figured", "55:17", "out how to make a jug you know I mean", "55:18", "that's technology technology today the", "55:21", "shit like the Higgs boson particle shit", "55:23", "like the Large Hadron Collider shit like", "55:25", "making time machines like what are you", "55:27", "doing like cooking what the fuck are you", "55:29", "doing you're not fixing the hole in the", "55:32", "ground in the Gulf that's making the oil", "55:33", "pull up shouldn't we pull all the", "55:35", "scientists off everything and go okay we", "55:37", "got to fix this before the whole ocean", "55:39", "gets poisoned i've always wondered why", "55:40", "they don't do that anyway so with cancer", "55:43", "this is anything I just like all right", "55:44", "all you guys we're going to you know", "55:46", "take all the senses at once to cancer", "55:48", "one year do it yeah yes you know these", "55:51", "guys aren't experts in their fields", "55:53", "obviously you mean I can't know", "55:54", "everything about everything it's a silly", "55:55", "concept I mean what I'm saying but it", "55:57", "would be great if they took all the top", "55:59", "scientists from all the different", "56:01", "disciplines that would be involved and", "56:03", "they immediately allocated funds to get", "56:05", "them to work on the project instantly", "56:06", "and just the government stuff I mean I'm", "56:08", "not in favor of the government stepping", "56:09", "in but in this case I would say this is", "56:11", "not just a natural disaster this is a", "56:14", "fucking catastrophic disaster where", "56:16", "apocalyptic disaster where they need to", "56:18", "step in and do something about this", "56:20", "immediately they need to like impose", "56:21", "like almost like a martial law like type", "56:23", "of a thing", "56:24", "take over the whole you know but then", "56:26", "again who's going to be good that's", "56:28", "doing that for the government the", "56:29", "government would have to involve the", "56:30", "private sector and then the private", "56:32", "sector would try to make a lot of money", "56:33", "from it and try to fuck people over and", "56:35", "it would be a big scandal would be like", "56:36", "Halliburton and they'd find out billions", "56:37", "dollars are missing from
