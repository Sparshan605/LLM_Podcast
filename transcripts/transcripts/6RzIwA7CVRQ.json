the", "28:54", "mayor has to deal with the president is", "28:56", "in charge of the military sort of but he", "28:59", "sorts one of the things that the", "29:00", "president has done is sort of

"33:17", "like it's bad it's bad it's not I feel", "33:21", "like I have to say that enough I'm not", "33:22", "saying let every every inmate out but", "33:24", "I'm saying it's bad but life in prison", "33:27", "well the idea that you can never reform", "33:29", "people yeah that's that seems insane and", "33:31", "yeah well I guess there's the other", "33:33", "perspective is where the resources going", "33:36", "to come from to actually reform some and", "33:37", "how much effort does it take and", "33:39", "individual cases are different and some", "33:41", "people really are just habitual", "33:43", "criminals and there's nothing you could", "33:44", "do about it and if you do release them", "33:45", "and they continue to do in a crime or", "33:48", "they hurt somebody that they didn't have", "33:51", "to like where does the burden lie there", "33:53", "but I you know I think Norway I believe", "33:55", "is the country Jamie let's look it up", "33:57", "that the longest prison prison census", "33:59", "you can get is 20 years prisoners live", "34:01", "in like one-bedroom apartments like they", "34:03", "you know they have TV they have and the", "34:05", "whole thing is like and this is San", "34:07", "Quentin as this - there's rehab programs", "34:08", "I talk to inmates who said the and then", "34:10", "after 20 years in Norway they talk to", "34:12", "you and go are you ready to go back", "34:14", "outside like they don't let you out", "34:15", "automatically but they sort of check", "34:16", "back in with you and so if you're not", "34:17", "like the guy who shot up the those", "34:20", "people in Norway he's probably gonna get", "34:22", "out again right but the whole idea is", "34:23", "that yeah small percentage of prisoners", "34:27", "served more than 14 years Wow yeah but", "34:29", "but the thing is they're in there like", "34:31", "like in San Quentin", "34:32", "I talked to inmates who said in most", "34:34", "California prisons the rehab programs", "34:36", "are AAA and Jesus like that's all they", "34:39", "have is Jesus just the pathway to Jesus", "34:44", "but in San Quentin there's a newspaper", "34:47", "there's there's uh there's there's a", "34:49", "restorative justice programs there's a", "34:51", "like a you know there's just a plate", "34:53", "that you can learn how to code like", "34:55", "there's a prisoners who learn how to", "34:56", "code right now so that when you come out", "34:57", "there's a sense of like I have there's", "34:59", "lots of other programs I can't even", "35:00", "think of it but there's also there's", "35:01", "yoga in San Quentin because the Bay", "35:03", "and so there's all these things in the", "35:06", "so that when you come out you are a more", "35:07", "fully formed human being so that you", "35:09", "have you have job skills you've done", "35:11", "restorative justice programs you've", "35:13", "helped other inmates who came in to do", "35:14", "restorative justice programs so when you", "35:16", "come out it's not that it's easy to get", "35:17", "pretty to be paroled from prison you", "35:19", "know but when you come out you were more", "35:21", "prepared for the world as opposed to", "35:22", "guys in other prisons in California who", "35:24", "get out who have just been like doing", "35:25", "rehab in Jesus and have no way to", "35:27", "interact with the world", "35:28", "yeah and just feel like they've just", "35:29", "been punished like being isolated and", "35:32", "locked in caged and as a lot of those", "35:34", "guys say they go in there for one crime", "35:35", "that's not a big deal and they learn how", "35:36", "to be better and better criminals in", "35:38", "prison but you have to sort of like", "35:39", "California has like levels of prison I", "35:41", "think level 4 is the worst and like", "35:43", "maybe level 5 but anyway so everybody", "35:46", "sort of starts out at level 4 so if you", "35:48", "like are in prison in California for", "35:50", "something you know that you know", "35:51", "shooting a gun in the air you're at a", "35:52", "level you're there with murderers yeah", "35:54", "and then you have to survive that and", "35:56", "hopefully graduate the san quintin but", "35:57", "if you're in there with murderers you", "35:58", "have to survive that and so a lot of", "36:00", "guys become bigger badder criminals", "36:01", "because they're surrounded by bigger", "36:03", "badder criminals just to put on armor", "36:05", "yeah just just to get through the day", "36:07", "and so to me like the whole I mean you", "36:09", "know the the you know and there's a lot", "36:11", "of money that's already in prisons", "36:12", "that's not being usable the prison you", "36:14", "know private prison system like we are", "36:16", "selling private companies are selling", "36:18", "like they have to keep the prisons full", "36:20", "because they're running a prison for", "36:22", "profit so it becomes less about like", "36:24", "it's like we need to keep the man full", "36:26", "you know it's not about like rehab and", "36:28", "rehabilitation it's about we need to", "36:29", "keep the beds full because we are", "36:30", "running we are a corporation running for", "36:32", "profit that's where it gets dark", "36:34", "the fuck did anybody ever approve that", "36:38", "it's basically they're using humans as", "36:41", "like cells and a battery yeah like a", "36:43", "giant battery that generates income yeah", "36:46", "exactly and that the prisoner if the", "36:48", "goal is not to turn these guys into", "36:50", "better citizen the citizens the goal is", "36:53", "to keep the men and women the goal is to", "36:54", "keep the prisons filled well it's", "36:56", "absolutely been proven by prison guard", "36:57", "unions trying to they mean they lobby", "36:59", "against marijuana legalization yeah", "37:02", "marijuana which is probably the one", "37:04", "thing that's gonna stop people from", "37:06", "committing crimes yeah I mean you're", "37:08", "talking about violent crimes if there is", "37:09", "a drug that's gonna stop you from doing", "37:11", "a violent crime that might be it or at", "37:13", "least it may be like lessen the chance", "37:16", "yes maybe I should sit down and just", "37:19", "chill out for a second before I go do", "37:21", "that thing yeah there's no other reason", "37:22", "to lobby against it you want to keep", "37:23", "your job you want to make sure that you", "37:25", "have plenty of jobs the people in your", "37:27", "Union yeah and their and those and as", "37:29", "many of those people who are in prison", "37:30", "for nonviolent drug offenses like", "37:33", "marijuana other things who are there", "37:34", "next to next to murderers yeah you know", "37:36", "look you don't have to figure out how to", "37:37", "navigate through that in there in if", "37:40", "you're not insane Clinton you're not", "37:41", "you're not in a place where you can", "37:43", "learn other skills we I mean you know", "37:45", "again guys isn't Clinton getting college", "37:47", "diplomas getting like all sorts of", "37:48", "certificates and things but the problem", "37:50", "is is that nobody then wants to release", "37:52", "them from prison right you take that", "37:54", "chance nobody when nobody wants to go", "37:55", "you know no politician goes I have", "37:57", "released more inmates from takes is one", "38:02", "Willie Horton right yeah which you know", "38:05", "and that was like you know we're again", "38:06", "we're demonizing like one case closed", "38:08", "same thing with Berkeley there's a", "38:10", "picture that was on the exams people", "38:12", "chronicle of a never antifungals ante", "38:14", "for black black areas I don't know like", "38:15", "with like with like a like a gas bomb", "38:18", "and surrounding that person is", "38:20", "journalists taking pictures of him", "38:22", "mm-hmm so that's yeah that becomes the", "38:25", "face it's like they're not surrounded by", "38:26", "other black bloc people right it's like", "38:28", "all the journals ago that's where the", "38:29", "picture is yeah you know not like the", "38:31", "people who are like I was in a truck", "38:33", "with clergy singing like spirituals", "38:36", "nobody took pictures of that and put it", "38:37", "on the news anyway I think that ended", "38:40", "yeah local public radio station because", "38:42", "I'm a celebrity I was in the back of the", "38:43", "truck well anytime there's like some", "38:47", "sort of a gathering you're always gonna", "38:48", "have people in that gathering that act", "38:51", "out try to get more attention than they", "38:53", "deserve or that get caught up in the", "38:55", "whole group movement like there's always", "38:58", "this sort of like gigantic mass of", "39:01", "people that will cause people to behave", "39:04", "some people to behave in a way that's", "39:07", "uncharacteristic or and I mean there's", "39:10", "just that mob mentality yeah thing that", "39:13", "happens it like you know rock concerts", "39:15", "or anything yeah yeah mentality is 100%", "39:19", "real you can feel it in the air which", "39:20", "shit's going sideways I mean it happens", "39:22", "every night but you've been in clubs", "39:24", "where it's like you know something", "39:25", "happens like a heckler or something that", "39:27", "energy changes and there's that moment", "39:28", "like what's about to happen", "39:29", "it feels like any and you also been in", "39:31", "that position I'm sure you have where", "39:32", "you feel like I have a lot of power in", "39:34", "this moment like I could if I if you", "39:41", "said you certainly if you said get them", "39:42", "people would get them you know I mean if", "39:45", "I said Gaeta maybe like I will write my", "39:47", "congressman right we should start a", "39:51", "petition you know but that's and that's", "39:53", "that's real that's a you know and I", "39:56", "think the thing is that everybody", "39:57", "responds differently the thing that", "39:58", "happened I'll say specifically in", "40:00", "Berkeley was that there's a sense that", "40:02", "these people brought violence to", "40:03", "Berkeley the last few times they came", "40:05", "right and people respond differently to", "40:07", "threats of violence some people respond", "40:08", "with the nonviolent things some people", "40:09", "respond to I won't go to the park that", "40:11", "day and some people responded with fuck", "40:13", "it bring it but don't you think there's", "40:15", "also a real issue in you I mean you got", "40:18", "to find out what is actual hate speech", "40:20", "and what is like someone like Ben", "40:23", "Shapiro who I think is just a", "40:25", "conservative guy who's very articulate", "40:28", "and doesn't promote hate at all and he's", "40:29", "extremely reasonable but there's a lot", "40:31", "of people that equate him even though", "40:33", "he's an Orthodox Jew a lot of people", "40:34", "equate him with being a Nazi and they", "40:36", "try to silence him from speaking like", "40:38", "when you do that I think it becomes a", "40:40", "giant issue and I think you gotta let", "40:42", "people talk and if you disagree with", "40:44", "people I mean as long as they're not out", "40:46", "there promoting violence or promoting", "40:48", "negativity or promoting some sort of a", "40:49", "you know anything that it's abhorrent", "40:53", "but if you if you let someone talk and", "40:56", "then if you have someone that disagrees", "40:57", "with them have a debate well I think", "40:59", "debate didn't have everybody like the", "41:00", "peaceful and civil with each other I", "41:02", "mean I think the the problem is is that", "41:04", "the that line of what hate speeches and", "41:06", "I just talked to someone from the ACLU", "41:08", "my other podcast about about the hill", "41:11", "hate speech thing what podcast", "41:12", "politically reactive yeah it's a podcast", "41:14", "my friend Hari Kondabolu",

"41:22", "they will go about our business that was", "41:28", "a big year that was the deal we were off", "41:29", "or do it up until the election and then", "41:31", "it was like oh I guess we're doing this", "41:32", "for them you may be forever", "41:33", "yeah maybe through the end of time so it", "41:35", "becomes like Putin yeah exact", "41:38", "you know although then I guess I stay", "41:40", "employed I don't know", "41:41", "this rock was on stage right after the", "41:43", "election he goes you know he's never", "41:44", "getting out of there you know that right", "41:46", "was gonna be there forever he scared the", "41:48", "shit out of me because I've never", "41:48", "thought about that I mean you know I", "41:50", "bloomberg stayed in New York an extra", "41:52", "term

ideological", "42:29", "arguments sometimes can't be filled with", "42:30", "hate so I'm not I don't know ben shapiro", "42:32", "so that's that sometimes it's like well", "42:34", "yeah it's just you're just making an", "42:35", "ideological argument but it ends with me", "42:37", "having to move out of america you know", "42:39", "so that's yeah but i'm saying so but you", "42:43", "know that some people make these i yes", "42:45", "I'm not saying him but the problem is is", "42:48", "that now there's a whole movement", "42:49", "associated with things that maybe been", "42:51", "it looks
