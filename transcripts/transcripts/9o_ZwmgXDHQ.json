"74:36", "taking me at just the words I'm saying", "74:38", "so what I'm seeing from this this that's", "74:40", "is like she's upset and you're upset", "74:43", "like she's upset she signed it and", "74:45", "you're upset she signed it yeah but that", "74:47", "doesn't mean nearly as much to me like", "74:50", "people making a mistake like her making", "74:52", "that mistake doesn't mean much to

them", "75:28", "liked rather than something that's", "75:30", "morally or ethically consistent that's", "75:32", "what I mean right", "75:33", "we've talked about this before that it", "75:35", "all comes down to the whole process of", "75:36", "being chosen to do things yeah what's", "75:38", "being chosen to direct or chosen to act", "75:40", "or chose everybody's constantly working", "75:42",

thing is weird that you can that", "163:52", "there are so many different kinds of", "163:53", "reality so the reality that that if you", "163:55", "go up into the stars it's a different", "163:58",

and all these", "165:09", "different things try to transition you", "165:11", "yeah but like existence is a weird thing", "165:14", "what do you think happens I don't know", "165:16", "man oh well when you go my feeling is", "165:19", "that talking this quantum physicist this", "165:21", "badass dude I feel like there must be", "165:26", "this idea that existence is a question", "165:31", "of he was talking about existence is a", "165:32", "question of the question what question", "165:34", "you're asking a where are you standing", "165:35", "so there there are different forms of", "165:38", "existence right so there are different", "165:40", "forms of reality like there's the", "165:42", "subatomic reality there's the Newtonian", "165:45", "reality that you can measure and see", "165:46", "we're here if I was looking at Los", "165:49", "Angeles from a plane that's a different", "165:51", "perspective it might be a different kind", "165:52", "of reality and he he kind of like said", "165:55", "most physicists he was trying to explain", "165:57", "what existence is right and how it's", "165:59", "meaningless and I was like what the fuck", "166:01", "he talked not any much he was talking", "166:02", "about mathematics he said", "166:04", "he said well this is a reality to us", "166:07", "because of where we are standing and the", "166:10", "space-time continuum that we are", "166:13", "occupying right now so we are here and", "166:16", "all that you are experiencing may not", "166:20", "may very well not even be a reality", "166:22", "right over in this direction yes what", "166:26", "the flats would need say when they sit", "166:28", "around with legal papers all day was", "166:30", "write a bunch of shit nobody fucks so", "166:32", "well that's well that's what I mean and", "166:35", "I said what's up I go what the fuck are", "166:37", "you talking about and he said he's gonna", "166:39", "win a Nobel Prize and he said um okay I", "166:42", "guess the best way to put it is think of", "166:44", "you having virtual reality goggles on", "166:48", "and you know people are splashing water", "166:50", "on you as you're in there in water and", "166:52", "you're getting rocked back and forth I", "166:53", "guess that's the best way to describe", "166:55", "what you what you consider to be your", "166:56", "reality I was like alright alright maybe", "167:01", "I don't know maybe maybe but they seemed", "167:04", "to be able to prove a lot of this and", "167:05", "like what's fascinating to me is I", "167:08", "didn't how to get into this but like he", "167:10", "was talking about how electrons can", "167:12", "communicate with each other like how to", "167:15", "sheet of metal and they don't they don't", "167:16", "see each other like in terms of the X", "167:19", "runs are light years away but they", "167:20", "completely all work together and and he", "167:22", "was talking about they would yeah", "167:23", "there's a mathematical way of proving", "167:25", "halls theorem is there's a mathematical", "167:27", "sort of algorithm that proves that they", "167:30", "are the answer to that is that there's", "167:33", "an invisible conductor like something a", "167:35", "higher intelligence and emergent", "167:38", "intelligence is dictating that", "167:42", "communications intelligence or order and", "167:44", "order right but not in intelligence", "167:47", "that's Owen tells us the wrong way it", "167:48", "said he said that to me too because I", "167:50", "said it tells him and he said order and", "167:52", "you're right so there's an order right", "167:53", "so there's a there's an order to the", "167:56", "chaos right so the way schools of fish", "167:58", "but you know she's voice a bird guess", "168:01", "what else behaves that way inert matter", "168:03", "yeah electrons well that's one of the", "168:05", "things that they think is going on with", "168:07", "birds it's one of the reasons why birds", "168:09", "have some sort of internal compass and", "168:10", "that they literally mentality they react", "168:13", "to the poles of the earth like they know", "168:16", "one my", "168:17", "reading birds they know which way to go", "168:19", "yeah like they really do somehow or", "168:21", "another but they also know not to fly", "168:23", "into each other like when you see them", "168:25", "all flying together and they move in", "168:27", "tandem yes say it's gorgeous aim it's", "168:29", "gorgeous but you know your brains are", "168:31", "the same waste of neurons yeah there's", "168:33", "no reason it makes no sense that the", "168:35", "neurons so each neuron is just", "168:36", "essentially an on/off switch or you know", "168:39", "it's a whatever it is but for whatever", "168:42", "reason all of those neurons have", "168:44", "self-organized who organize them they", "168:47", "self-organized okay that's what's", "168:50", "fascinating and the way your brain has", "168:52", "self-organized so has this sheet of", "168:55", "metal and he kind of proved he sat", "168:58", "around and I think he's 38 or 39 and he", "169:01", "and he solved this this theorem called", "169:03", "halls theorem took them three years to", "169:04", "make sure he was right don't you think", "169:06", "that happens when there's like like a", "169:08", "big mass event like like mob mentality", "169:13", "don't you think that's part of what is", "169:15", "going on with mob mentality and that", "169:17", "things happen and things can get chaotic", "169:19", "and people just go with it", "169:20", "they go with it in mob and I think I", "169:22", "think the origin of that is probably", "169:25", "survival instinct in war that in war you", "169:29", "have to accept unbelievably barbaric", "169:32", "reality and so you have to be able to", "169:35", "slide into that whatever we're killing", "169:37", "everybody with axes let's go and then", "169:39", "everybody else is doing it I guess I'm", "169:40", "in and then you start hacking people up", "169:42", "where you would never do it by yourself", "169:45", "if it was just totally up to you but you", "169:47", "find yourself getting caught up in the", "169:49", "way in the hive where the human hive is", "169:52", "moving but all these people are moving", "169:54", "towards violence or moving towards chaos", "169:56", "like people get wrapped up in these mob", "169:59", "mentality moments in a very very well", "170:01", "you can also go you can actually you can", "170:04", "step back from that and actually you can", "170:08", "explain that actually when you look at", "170:10", "bacteria certain bacteria and certain", "170:14", "insect colonies and let me explain so", "170:18", "somebody like Antonio Damasio who is a", "170:21", "behavioral scientist who wrote a fucking", "170:23", "great book but very dense called the", "170:25", "strange order of things and he talks", "170:27", "about how", "170:29", "human beings behave in a certain way", "170:31", "like their feelings are directly related", "170:36", "to their biology because their feelings", "170:38", "are essentially the voices or the", "170:42", "mechanism by which you know whether or", "170:44", "not to bring your body back in", "170:45", "homeostasis when it's out of homeostasis", "170:48", "when it's out of this homeo dynamic", "170:50", "actually state right so in other words", "170:51", "that mob is probably going in there with", "170:55", "axes because they spur sive the feelings", "170:59", "are they perceive a threat from that", "171:02", "other group because that other group is", "171:04", "going to take something from them okay", "171:06", "it's going to either take their", "171:07", "resources their children whatever it", "171:10", "might be and take over their territory", "171:11", "so so watch bacteria actually behave the", "171:15", "exact same way and you can put bacteria", "171:18", "into certain like and there's a", "171:20", "scientist does this a lot", "171:21", "you can put them into certain conditions", "171:23", "where the bacteria will behave like that", "171:25", "they'll do some fascinating things not", "171:27", "only will they fucking take over the", "171:29", "other bacteria and go out into an", "171:31", "all-out war and kill mercilessly the", "171:33", "other bacteria but sometimes when they", "171:35", "find they can't kill that bacteria", "171:36", "they'll actually cooperate with that", "171:38", "bacteria now how about this within the", "171:42", "ranks of their own bacteria the bacteria", "171:43", "that are not pulling their weight that", "171:46", "tend to be lazier than the other", "171:48", "bacteria even of the same they're the", "171:49", "same species those bacteria will be", "171:52", "fucking shunned they'll be pushed out", "171:54", "they will not like people they're there", "171:58", "they're the weak link insects if you", "172:01", "look at insect colonies they behave very", "172:04", "much like human cultures do you got an", "172:07", "ant that's protecting the queen ant or", "172:09", "the bee that's protecting the Queen B", "172:11", "you have soldiers that do the fighting", "172:14", "you have workers that do the working and", "172:17", "they self organize in this incredible", "172:19", "way and nobody's really know it's not", "172:21", "like it's somebody it's not a top-down", "172:23", "thing it's sort of a genetically", "172:25", "programmed thing but their behavior is", "172:27", "very similar their behavior so even with", "172:31", "bacteria when they can't beat this", "172:33", "bacteria they'll join forces with that", "172:35", "bacteria to defeat the other bacteria", "172:37", "that's weaker and it's fascinating so", "172:39", "even on the unicellular level", "172:42", "you see striking similarities between", "172:45", "humans and even bacteria now add to that", "172:48", "the fact that one only one in ten of", "172:51", "your cells as a human being is actually", "172:52", "human and the rest is bacteria back time", "172:55", "done yeah in fact you as a human might", "172:57", "be the patina", "172:58", "you're just the patina on a background", "173:02", "of bacteria so maybe bacteria is", "173:05", "dictating how the fuck you behave will", "173:07", "the bacteria here outside its skin", "173:09", "inside and outside skin floor is", "173:11", "incredibly important yes that's why we", "173:13", "recommend people eat probiotics it's one", "173:15", "of the things that helps you with", "173:17", "diseases and then natural oil soaps and", "173:20", "not non antibacterial soaps that's very", "173:23", "important so so that's right so keeping", "173:25", "your your biodome yeah in order which is", "173:29", "the new science might also be dictating", "173:32", "your very behavior I think it does I", "173:34", "think when I eat healthier and I eat a", "173:36", "lot of probiotics I feel like more at", "173:38", "ease I feel more comfortable I heard you", "173:40", "have to be careful with that probiotics", "173:42", "because you can throw off your we've got", "173:43", "level two and what are you eating though", "173:45", "I'm eating it in food my I've decided a", "173:47", "long time ago that I mean you can take", "173:49", "some probiotic pills and stuff like that", "173:52", "and I definitely take someone I'm on the", "173:53", "road yeah I bring that on a total gut", "173:56", "health because I'm on the road I don't", "173:57", "know what the fuck I mean right I want", "173:58", "to make sure I'm getting good food but a", "173:59", "mom at home I eat a lot of fermented", "174:01", "vegetables I've been I've been there's a", "174:03", "lot of that i kimchi like almost every", "174:05", "day well because you're an extremist I", "174:07", "know yeah but it's it is good if you", "174:09", "feel good drink a lot of that shit that",
