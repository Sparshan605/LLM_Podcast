they're getting and", "22:58", "these things are coming in and out of", "22:59", "the atmosphere then you also have people", "23:00", "from the agency that are worried about", "23:02", "in collecting information of what's", "23:04", "going on with people in different", "23:06", "countries and here but then you also", "23:08", "have you know engineers that have a", "23:11", "perspective on how the technology is", "23:13", "made and what that might mean because", "23:15", "there's a lot of consciousness stuff", "23:16", "that falls into this case right there so", "23:18", "there's satellites that track them", "23:20", "coming in and out of the atmosphere", "23:22", "absolutely yeah absolutely", "23:24", "what kind of satellites are these uh how", "23:27", "was out fuck I don't know usually", "23:29", "forward-looking infra-red", "23:30", "but I don't know what spectrum of the", "23:32", "infrared they're looking at so there's", "23:33", "some sort of a camera or some sort of a", "23:36", "detection device that they have in the", "23:39", "atmosphere just to check for UFO I don't", "23:41", "know if it's just for UFOs they can pick", "23:43", "up very very specific heat signatures", "23:46", "and they have algorithms because what", "23:49", "you have is a satellite as a device that", "23:53", "can pick up what you what you program it", "23:55", "to pick up now you know you put a sensor", "23:58", "on there but you got to tell the sensor", "23:59", "what to do right so if the sensor says", "24:02", "look something traveling at this speed", "24:03", "with this kind of heat you know you got", "24:06", "to record that you got focus on it and", "24:08", "that that's what we call an ICBM but if", "24:10", "something comes in and zigzag stops and", "24:12", "turns left and it's traveling ten times", "24:13", "faster than that we need you to record", "24:15", "that and focus in on that as well but if", "24:17", "something just is moving low and it's", "24:19", "only going 300 miles an hour and it has", "24:21", "these big wings and a low whatever", "24:22", "they're all just a plane you know so the", "24:25", "what it captures is based on you know", "24:27", "how it's programmed in the first place", "24:30", "but you can differentiate between", "24:32", "meteorites and absolutely yes absolutely", "24:34", "so so how often of these things coming", "24:37", "into our atmosphere oh shit I don't know", "24:39", "but I I've had quite a few discussions", "24:41", "one of the people I I've been I've been", "24:44", "in contact one at one of my advisers", "24:47", "from the National Reconnaissance Office", "24:48", "high up high high up and they call it", "24:52", "episodic visits that's all I know", "24:54", "episodic like they have time periods", "24:57", "were they like there was I saw paper", "24:59", "where they semesters I figured out the", "25:02", "Department of fence figured out a", "25:04", "physicist they're an algorithm of how to", "25:07", "compute when the things fly in and", "25:09", "collect smaller ships like mothership", "25:12", "small ships what what at what longitude", "25:15", "and latitude and and what essentially", "25:17", "what orbit it would land at when it", "25:19", "would collect these other machines and", "25:21", "so they tested that and in all I know is", "25:24", "it was successful you think this is", "25:26", "happening on a very frequent basis well", "25:28", "let me tell you the rest of the story so", "25:30", "I and this is it's important because", "25:32", "you'll see so he goes what do you need I", "25:35", "said I need to buy advisors and then so", "25:37", "next thing you know I leave and two", "25:40", "weeks later Bam Bam Bam my email starts", "25:41", "I have all these Admirals all these", "25:43", "generals no no intelligence people other", "25:45", "than other than brass that were", "25:47", "connected with the National", "25:48", "Reconnaissance Office but natural", "25:50", "connaissance office is half airforce and", "25:52", "half CIA but they're all they're all", "25:55", "military hmm and so I start talking to", "25:59", "them I start meeting with

"concerted international effort to deal", "27:10", "with this stuff and that was in my book", "27:12", "and that is it's not like Roswell", "27:15", "crashed and it what's not like you know", "27:18", "like all the typical UFO shit that", "27:20", "people dwell on isn't the story it's", "27:22", "just that there's something crashed or", "27:24", "someone sawed got abducted and saw this", "27:26", "or someone pulled a little piece of", "27:27", "metal out of their body but no one's put", "27:30", "together what we're doing about it", "27:31", "because our countrymen since world war", "27:35",

a better way to do", "31:18", "this and what you see is me and some", "31:23", "very important people coming together to", "31:24", "do something that I think is really", "31:26", "beneficial to society but a lot we have", "31:29", "a lot of work to do because a lot of", "31:29", "people think they don't know what to", "31:31", "think of it at first they thought I was", "31:33", "nuts when I was talking about look I'm", "31:34", "all i got these advisors you know and", "31:36", "then I'll send the Wall Street Journal", "31:38", "broke this story and there's all these", "31:39", "multi star generals and and a head of", "31:42", "some really big aerospace companies and", "31:45", "then then the big news organizations", "31:47", "were like holy shit this is this might", "31:50", "be real a lot of kids still don't know", "31:51", "and they're having fun on the Internet", "31:53", "and then I came out a couple weeks ago", "31:55", "on stage with all these people now it's", "31:58",

stuff how", "32:19", "do we bring the technology out of the", "32:21", "shadows and build it for the world and", "32:24", "how do we you know tell the story in", "32:28", "documentaries nonfiction

Isis and they're here and we need", "32:48", "to understand them and we need to fuck", "32:50", "and figure it out quick but the problem", "32:53", "is these are extraordinarily advanced", "32:55", "civilizations that have been coming here", "32:56", "forever that's why it's all in all the", "32:59", "ancient fucking scripts and texts and", "33:02", "carved into rocks and all that shit but", "33:05", "trying to figure it out trying to", "33:07", "connect the dots and trying to I mean", "33:09", "looking at debris that they probably", "33:12", "still have in a warehouse ago we have no", "33:14", "fucking clue", "33:16", "how to make this or back engineer this", "33:18", "stuff I mean there's a piece of metal", "33:20", "from a crash that I've seen and I've", "33:24", "seen the science on it and it's it's so", "33:28", "it's atomically aligned in its layered", "33:30", "and Malta like 80 layers within just a", "33:32", "few microns of purities of metal that", "33:36", "aren't even in our solar system and they", "33:39", "think it needs to be made in in a area", "33:42", "where there's no gravity so number one", "33:43", "has to be made in space number two even", "33:46", "if we were to create a machine that can", "33:48", "potentially do some of this stuff", "33:50", "3d printing layers of different metals", "33:53", "that of obscene purities it would cost", "33:55", "hundreds and hundreds of millions of", "33:57", "dollars we don't even have that why did", "33:59", "I think it was made without gravity", "34:00", "because uh I think it's the atomic", "34:03", "structure so what happens is is when you", "34:04", "radiate it with terahertz it loses mass", "34:08", "something weird it resonates some kind", "34:11", "of harmonic and then it gets lighter and", "34:13", "if you hit it with enough terahertz", "34:15", "it'll float so we're gonna be showing", "34:16", "people this stuff we're gonna be", "34:18", "bringing out the hardware some of the", "34:20", "hardware gonna be bringing out implants", "34:21", "we're gonna be bringing out videos we're", "34:23", "gonna be bringing out showing people", "34:25", "this actual physical piece of metal that", "34:28", "was constructed in a zero-gravity", "34:29", "environment in space and if you hit it", "34:32", "with enough energy it becomes weightless", "34:34", "I wouldn't say weightless I don't know", "34:36", "if we can make enough energy to do that", "34:37", "but yes that is our plan and not only in", "34:40", "show the experiment so yeah well if you", "34:42", "can't give it enough energy to make it", "34:44", "weightless can you give it enough energy", "34:46", "to reduce the mass yes so weighs less", "34:49", "yes and you can prove this yes and", "34:51", "that's why I didn't have a scale and you", "34:53", "can put this piece of metal do scale", "34:55", "I'll do you better it's not it's not", "34:56", "even that it's warping the space-time", "34:59", "continuum around the object so you shoot", "35:01", "what you can do is you can shoot an", "35:02", "electron over it why it's why it's not a", "35:05", "single electron a high and you collect", "35:07", "it in time that how do you shoot a", "35:09", "single electron if I know I'm not", "35:11", "physicist they just do this shit that's", "35:12", "what they do so and I was actually on a", "35:14", "phone call today about it I like talked", "35:16", "for about 45 minutes in the car on the", "35:18", "way up here about some of the some of", "35:20", "the how would they even be able to", "35:21", "regulate whether or not they have a", "35:22", "single electron well dude fuck they're", "35:25", "doing crazier shit than that at CERN at", "35:27", "CERN they're taking particles of atom", "35:29", "and they're speeding them up to light", "35:31", "speed almost lights yeah and you know", "35:32", "slamming them into each other so I'm not", "35:34", "too worried about electron life this is", "35:36", "an enormous building that's I think it's", "35:39", "was it turns like ten miles you know", "35:42", "yeah but you've seen an electron", "35:44", "microscope right and it's like the size", "35:45", "I have this but I'm saying they're", "35:47", "launching a single electron at this", "35:49", "thing I know I think that's what they do", "35:52", "yeah hmm they do that with photons too", "35:54", "by the way I read I read a really cool", "35:56", "study about single photons and", "35:58", "consciousness was interacting with it", "36:00", "just just by thinking it was changing", "36:02", "the way the photon went it's crazy", "36:04", "hmm so what happens is is you shoot this", "36:06", "electron and you know how fast it is to", "36:08", "travel over this piece of metal then you", "36:10", "then you radiate it with terahertz and", "36:12", "then you shouldn't mean radiate it with", "36:14", "time you're you're electrifying and", "36:17", "charging the piece of material you know", "36:18", "to what it's a terahertz it's it's a", "36:20", "it's a high frequency wave I don't want", "36:22", "to pretend I know that much about it I", "36:24", "just know that the earlier tests were", "36:26", "with radio waves like RF and and they", "36:29", "need to do terahertz so I I don't know", "36:31", "much more than that so and so by radiate", "36:34", "by shooting terahertz at it the piece of", "36:37", "metal can lose mass and then when you", "36:38", "shoot an electron over it it'll be a", "36:40", "different time than the other one when", "36:43", "it's not turned on does that make sense", "36:44", "no the time it takes for an electron to", "36:48", "go over the piece of metal what's up", "36:49", "Jamie this is why I type in terahertz", "36:51", "imaging laser guided codes advanced", "36:54", "single pixel tella terahertz imagery and", "36:57", "this be the images sampled upon", "37:00", "instructions from a laser a the", "37:03", "terahertz light passes through the", "37:05", "object and then see the information is", "37:07", "collected to reconstruct the image look", "37:10", "at that", "37:11", "so with this stuff just an imaging", "37:13", "technique but your your timing how fast", "37:16", "it takes an electron to move over the", "37:18", "surface of the metal then you charge the", "37:20", "metal and then you're timing the exact", "37:22", "same thing and there will be different", "37:24", "times and the positive result is that it", "37:26", "lost mass so it traveled faster or", "37:28", "slower or whatever the help is supposed", "37:30", "to happen so and so I would imagine that", "37:33", "this just this piece of metal if it", "37:35", "exists would be kind of game over if you", "37:37", "brought this piece of metal to", "37:39", "the most advanced scientists and", "37:42", "metallurgy or whatever they would be", "37:44", "that would understand this kind of shit", "37:45", "yeah it's already been there but the", "37:48", "problem is is there anywhere online", "37:49", "where people can read about this", "37:51", "there actually is there's some some of", "37:53", "this stuff not this piece in particular", "37:55", "that came out as arts parts on arts Bell", "37:58", "a long time ago and they're different", "37:59", "layers of bismuth and magnesium but I", "38:02", "but this one came from a crash in 48 not", "38:06", "the 47 and I know nothing more about it", "38:09", "but I don't think it's anything they're", "38:10", "coming here with a Chain of Custody you", "38:11", "say this came from Air Force or", "38:13", "something like that you know I don't", "38:15", "know who has this so you're gonna bring", "38:17", "this and demonstrate this to people yeah", "38:19", "and the reason is is because we need to", "38:22", "we're also going to show videos that", "38:25", "just got Declassified from our most", "38:27", "advanced systems I think they called the", "38:29", "aegis system it's a radar system and", "38:32", "forward-looking infra-red of UFOs I have", "38:35", "those in possession actually already and", "38:36", "so we're going to show the videos that", "38:38", "just I mean the first time in history by", "38:40", "the way that videos of UFOs have been", "38:43", "Declassified there's been leaks and", "38:45", "there's been people catching shit on", "38:47", "their phones but I have all the chain of", "38:48", "custody all the documents and everything", "38:50", "and we just got those a few weeks ago", "38:51", "and there's a shitload more coming and", "38:54", "so we'll release the videos and we'll", "38:56", "show the experiment as a proof of", "38:58", "concept so everyone knows this shit's", "38:59", "all real because right now they're just", "39:01", "looking at a drawing and they're looking", "39:02", "at this guy from the skunkworks", "39:03", "you know and just gonna how the fuck are", "39:05", "they going to build a machine that plays", "39:07", "with time and plays with the fabric of", "39:09", "space-time and so we have to kind of", "39:11", "educate people and say it's possible", "39:13", "it's possible", "39:14", "yeah that's advanced electro gravity", "39:19", "gravity propulsion is that I say that", "39:22", "electrogravitic", "39:23", "grow vidiq so what that does what the", "39:25", "machine does that we're building is", "39:27", "there's a there's an electromagnetic", "39:29", "wave that is the foundation of", "39:32", "everything of all mass of everything", "39:34", "like it's some people called it", "39:36", "zero-point energy some people call it", "39:38", "the vacuum energy but like one inch of", "39:42", "air could power the United States for", "39:44", "like hundreds of years kind of thing or", "39:45", "maybe more so what they got to do is", "39:48", "isolate very specific atoms to where all", "39:50", "the noise of all matter and", "39:52", "cellphones and everything that's going", "39:54", "on on earth can be can be separated from", "39:56", "this one atom and if you can do that", "39:59", "with the right material you can get", "40:01", "access to that electromagnetic wave", "40:03", "that's powering the atom the the", "40:05", "invisible wave pattern that that's under", "40:07", "everything of all existence and once you", "40:10", "do that it's not like splitting an atom", "40:12", "this is the power behind the atom it's", "40:15", "extraordinarily dangerous but it's also", "40:18", "what will turn that thing on", "40:21", "and it'll turn into a ball of light and", "40:22", "just disappear and I could show you a", "40:24", "video of of something doing that that's", "40:26", "actually on YouTube you know okay I tell", "40:28", "Jim what it is I would have to I could", "40:31", "search it for a second oh you how about", "40:33", "this well there's no commercial breaks", "40:35", "is there no fuck just search it just", "40:38", "describe it you know what if you type in", "40:43", "astra the tr-3b astra tier three B and", "40:51", "I'll walk over that guy walk over there", "40:52", "for a second so much wonder is good", "41:03", "they'll be able to see it put it up on", "41:06", "the screen so what what this is for you", "41:21", "this is the craft by the way Astro", "41:28", "that's why sorry Astro Astro we're", "41:39", "looking on YouTube ladies and gentlemen", "41:41", "if you're in your car right now going", "41:42", "what the fuck is going on in the show", "41:44", "most the vast majority the people just", "41:47", "listen to the show so for the people", "41:50", "that are just listening and you want to", "41:52", "go check it out TR thirty-eight Astra", "41:55", "Aurora project through this AF o3b sorry", "42:00", "this is the craft and secret machines", "42:02", "book that's all I'm gonna say and this", "42:04", "thing is floating in the", "42:08", "it'll take a few seconds till they turn", "42:11", "on the engine that looks pretty badass", "42:15", "no wait you can see little lights", "42:16", "dancing around on the bottom but I think", "42:20", "this was leaked on purpose because the", "42:21", "guy's making it just hard enough to see", "42:23", "moving the camera around in and out of", "42:25", "focus yeah all right look it's got like", "42:27", "he's barely focusing boy that looks like", "42:30", "a drone well", "42:32", "it looks small too it's not it's that's", "42:34", "pretty big I would think that one's", "42:36", "about 40 feet really look see the tail", "42:38", "fins on the back that's how you know", "42:39", "it's not alien per se it's built off I", "42:41", "think technology that came from there", "42:44", "but you know they don't need vertical", "42:47", "tail stabilized what's that big like", "42:49", "okay this is the engine they turn it on", "42:50", "so right now they're act they're", "42:52", "accessing that energy I told you about", "42:54", "no and watch what happens it's gone", "42:58", "there's a pilot in that if that was in a", "43:00", "movie I'd want my money back nice movie", "43:03", "can suck my dick why why so fake oh you", "43:06", "think that yeah what is that tiara three", "43:09", "beers yes real these ones other ones are", "43:11", "the same one but these ones are stacked", "43:13", "and that's a drone that came out of one", "43:15", "that's a drone", "43:16", "the small one is of the little thing", "43:18", "that came out the side yeah but if you", "43:20", "you can look at black triangle UFO and", "43:21", "find hundreds of these videos so these", "43:23", "are people like civilians that are", "43:26", "getting this from the ground I filming", "43:28", "this I don't know I don't know where", "43:30", "this one came one came to Jaime this is", "43:31", "not the same count as the last video up", "43:34", "next because it's probably uh highly", "43:36", "valued tr-3b V alright how many views is", "43:39", "out four hundred and seventy four", "43:40", "thousand there's a hundred there's how", "43:43", "many people know now there's hundreds of", "43:44", "these out there oh no it separates from", "43:47", "the other one but everyone thinks", "43:48", "everyone thinks it's alien and that's", "43:52", "not my belief so you think this is", "43:54", "something along the lines like when they", "43:55", "have the stealth bomber program we're", "43:57", "experimenting with these things what do", "43:59", "you think of Robert Lazar do you think", "44:00", "that guys are real I'm putting out his", "44:01", "autobiography so you do think he's legit", "44:03", "should Ria's buck yeah yeah absolutely", "44:06", "yeah he's a fascinating character right", "44:08", "um he is he is his story is really", "44:11", "interesting to where he really fucked up", "44:14", "though so for the people I don't know", "44:15", "that are listening he's a guy that came", "44:17", "out he's the reason we know about", "44:19", "51 i'm he literally is the is the guy", "44:23", "that broke the story of its existence he", "44:26", "got brought in for a job and the during", "44:30", "the interviews they said we have another", "44:32", "idea for you and they put him in a place", "44:34", "he claims how all these disks and he was", "44:38", "on a back engineering team as a", "44:39", "physicist but what happened was they", "44:42", "rushed him in there because per his", "44:43", "story they tried to cut into one of the", "44:45", "propulsion devices and it exploded and", "44:48", "killed a bunch of scientists so the", "44:50", "Nevada Test Site which is the area where", "44:52", "area 51 and all that stuff is released a", "44:54", "statement that they were just doing a", "44:55", "small little nuke test but it was really", "44:57", "because of this thing and so they rushed", "44:59", "him in there without doing all of his", "45:00", "background checks because it takes six", "45:02", "months to a year and during those", "45:05", "background checks he was already working", "45:06", "on this stuff they on they found that", "45:09", "his wife was going a little haywire", "45:12", "because he couldn't tell her what she", "45:13", "was what he was doing and he would leave", "45:14", "in the middle of the night he'd be gone", "45:16", "for a week and she was getting fed up", "45:18", "and so she started having an affair and", "45:20", "so they're listening in on all the phone", "45:21", "calls and checking him out and kind of", "45:23", "going his home life is unstable so they", "45:25", "stopped calling him to come into work", "45:26", "why they figure it out he knows I mean", "45:29", "he's working next to a guy with a", "45:30", "machine gun", "45:30", "he knows that that this is no fucking", "45:34", "joke it no one knows what he's been", "45:36", "doing he thought he did something wrong", "45:38", "so at the nervous individual he is he", "45:41", "runs to the to his friends and says this", "45:43", "is what I've been doing this is what", "45:45", "I've been working on there's alien craft", "45:46", "it's over here at Groom Lake and the", "45:48", "tests are every Wednesday night at eight", "45:50", "o'clock and his wife goes holy shit and", "45:52", "his friend goes holy shit and he goes", "45:54", "come on I'll show you so they drive", "45:55", "three hours north of Vegas outs on", "45:57", "public land and they videotape and watch", "45:59", "these UFOs come up and be tested and", "46:01", "dart around and disappear and he goes", "46:03", "that's the one I'm working on and it's", "46:04", "almost like well how did you know what", "46:06", "time because I'm working on it well he", "46:07", "does is three times I think it was three", "46:08", "times and on the third time they got", "46:10", "caught because there's I've been there", "46:12", "there's security that that travels those", "46:14", "mountains you always hear about those", "46:15", "guys out there in area 51 and when they", "46:17", "caught him they're like holy fuck", "46:19", "he's he's like what the fuck is he doing", "46:22", "you know why is he telling everything so", "46:24", "he runs to the news station with George", "46:26", "Knapp who's another another he's a host", "46:30", "on coast to coast", "46:31", "and he tells him what he's doing and he", "46:34", "just goes live on Las Vegas news and it", "46:36", "caught like wildfire across the world", "46:39", "and so then these guys grabbed him put", "46:41", "him in a room put a gun to his head and", "46:43", "said when we told you not to say", "46:45", "anything we didn't mean say everything", "46:47", "you know and he got really scared they", "46:49", "started fucking with him I was actually", "46:50", "in a meeting", "46:51", "two nights ago talking about some of the", "46:53", "things they did one of the things he did", "46:54", "he went to a gym he used to he didn't", "46:56", "have access to a lot of guns but for", "46:57", "some fucking reason he had like an Uzi", "46:59", "it was in his glove compartment he goes", "47:01", "to a gym and he comes out and his car", "47:02", "doors are open the glove compartment is", "47:04", "open and he's just sitting on his chair", "47:06", "he got a got shot out on the freeway", "47:09", "and they erased a bunch of his records", "47:11", "and he still to this day really nervous", "47:13", "about it he always claimed he but for a", "47:16", "while he claimed he had part of this is", "47:18", "what I will say he claimed the energy", "47:20", "source was an element that was very", "47:23", "heavy and it was like uh appending him", "47:25", "or something like that 115 element and", "47:28", "25 years ago he talked all about it he's", "47:30", "old and then literally three years ago", "47:33", "maybe four they added it to the periodic", "47:35", "table what is this stuff called again", "47:37", "I think it's called unup ne emits one", "47:39", "element 115 it's odd and that's the", "47:42", "other thing is people don't really shit", "47:44", "25 years ago he says this element comes", "47:46", "from a binary star system and its really", "47:48", "heavy there's a certain isotope that's", "47:50", "stable they'll find it and then all", "47:52", "sudden I remember one day I was driving", "47:53", "my car and I heard it like I'm seeing", "47:54", "that new element added to the periodic", "47:56", "table also holy shit", "47:57", "you know but it's a pretty interesting", "47:59", "crazy story yeah well they erased his", "48:03", "his daughter would the widow's the claim", "48:05", "that he they had erased his educational", "48:08", "record well I think he might have people", "48:11", "I don't know if I think this because I", "48:13", "don't even I don't know I never", "48:14", "researched it but people that I know", "48:16", "that have research to think he might", "48:18", "have kind of upgraded his resident his", "48:20", "resume a little bit and maybe he didn't", "48:22", "go to MIT right that was a claim but", "48:24", "they also said that he really did work", "48:27", "for what's that lab in New Mexico", "48:30", "oh well Lawrence Livermore and JPL JPL", "48:33", "yeah Jake Hills and Pasadena yeah but", "48:35", "but well whatever it was it was in New", "48:37", "Mexico that they had found that he", "48:38", "actually did work in the building even", "48:40", "though they tried to say that he didn't", "48:42", "yeah maybe he did something with", "48:44", "somebody", "48:45", "and however much of his store was true", "48:48", "always gets fishy when you find one", "48:50", "thing that's not true like that he", "48:52", "didn't go to MIT stand free yet you know", "48:54", "Stan yeah yeah Stanton Friedman who's a", "48:56", "very famous UFO researcher he's one of", "48:59", "the main guys arguing that Bob Lazar is", "49:02", "full of shit yeah you know what's", "49:04", "interesting is there is there is a I", "49:08", "know the guy that did all the research", "49:10", "on that and I know the guy that studied", "49:12", "it for decades and he's actually writing", "49:15", "a foreword on the book it's the the", "49:17", "journalist has won like eight Peabody", "49:20", "Awards and Emmys and shit but uh George", "49:23", "Knapp who I told you about and he's just", "49:25", "Scott like he could speak for hours

so", "49:37", "what it's called Popular Mechanics", "49:42", "welcome element 115 now what's your real", "49:45", "name researchers create element 115 the", "49:47", "lab for the second time over the

Bob Lazar and went 150 yeah", "49:59", "because I would think that if he knew", "50:00", "that like that long ago like that alone", "50:03", "would make people want to take him more", "50:05", "seriously yeah all the stuff that he", "50:06", "said well first of all we know that", "50:08", "there is a groom lake we know that there", "50:10", "is an Arian 51 we know they denied its", "50:11",

this and so they", "50:27", "wanted to expand the perimeter a", "50:29", "prohibited area and so in doing so they", "50:32", "had to admit the existence of the base", "50:33", "itself I believe that was in the 90s", "50:35", "right it was in the 90s they expanded", "50:39", "the perimeter something else that the", "50:41", "government had to do is they had to", "50:42", "admit UFOs were real because there was a", "50:44", "some military people look at yeah he", "50:48", "talked about 115 all through this it was", "50:50", "years this Jamie doesn't say the video", "50:53", "on the bottom what are the ones it was", "50:54", "was this put out this video well this", "50:57", "one here is 25", "50:58", "team but the video was taken on VHS what", "51:01", "was fuck this is 1990 maybe it's on the", "51:03", "sci-fi channel do-do-do-do-do", "51:06", "back when it was spelled sci-fi yeah", "51:08", "everyone uses a lot of yfy yeah that's", "51:11", "old as fuck yeah played some of that",

"51:21", "guy's obviously smartest fuck came in", "51:25", "the top of the reactor and the base of", "51:28", "the reactor apparently is the small", "51:32", "something similar to a cyclotron it's a",

there's a gravity", "53:09", "wave that's accessible on", "53:12", "a large element that extends beyond the", "53:14", "perimeter of the atom and when you", "53:16", "bombard that that element with

craft that he had found", "54:21", "inside one of these bays in area 51", "54:24", "he realized very quickly that it wasn't", "54:26", "something that we had created and that", "54:28", "it was somehow another powered through", "54:30", "intention yep that would go through like", "54:32", "touch or feel or put their hands would", "54:34", "be on this thing and consciously you", "54:36",

have", "54:53", "you seen I've seen many many documents", "54:57", "on the studies of these things and I've", "55:01", "seen a lot of the science associated", "55:04", "with what the technology is and what it", "55:07", "does like I could show you if I fold up", "55:11", "pieces of paper and stuff what's going", "55:12", "on with it but basically I you know", "55:15", "these craft well you know when when you", "55:18", "travel in a straight line but they're", "55:20", "folding spaced like in event horizon", "55:23", "where they explain it by folding a piece", "55:24", "of paper and punching a", "55:25", "so through it you ever see them yeah", "55:27", "yeah it's kind of like I've been moving", "55:28", "but it's more like you know here I can", "55:31", "draw it for you here not that this is a", "55:33", "it's kind of like when you have two", "55:36", "points you know we're used to traveling", "55:39", "in a direction like that mm-hmm and so", "55:41", "when we look up we see a plane that goes", "55:44", "straight right but these these UFOs fold", "55:48", "space-time like this and so it looks", "55:52", "like to them they're going in a straight", "55:54", "line so if you're in the ship you see", "55:57", "that but if you're on the ground you see", "56:00", "that okay that's why you see them blink", "56:02", "off and on a lot of those videos they're", "56:04", "on they looks like they're jumping it's", "56:06", "just because of this so they're having", "56:08", "space time some way of interfacing with", "56:11", "space itself that's very different than", "56:13", "our idea of traveling in a linear way", "56:15", "from point A to point base space the", "56:17", "fabric they call it the fabric of", "56:18", "space-time because it's like a fabric", "56:20", "it's malleable now let me ask you this", "56:22", "how often into a conversation do people", "56:25", "look at you and think you are fucking", "56:26", "crazy when you start talking about this", "56:28", "and how all the time all the time right", "56:30", "but do you ever get to the probably like", "56:31", "I don't want to talk about this", "56:32", "no because it's it's you I always tell", "56:36", "me you don't know what I know you know", "56:37", "and there's a lot I know no I mean like", "56:39", "do you ever get to the point where", "56:40", "you're like I can't do this anymore", "56:41",

tell you stuff I know this", "56:57", "is some fucking trend shit when is all", "56:59", "this gonna come out like it seems like", "57:00", "this is like animate eminent rather", "57:03", "disclosure type shit watch what my", "57:05", "company does that's what I'll say so", "57:07", "what is your company what do you what", "57:08", "are you trying to do well we created so", "57:10", "if you look at the people involved we", "57:13", "have senior high when you get to the", "57:15", "senior levels of government you're", "57:17", "either called an SES or SAS senior", "57:19", "intelligence service senior executive", "57:20", "service or your brass but either way the", "57:23", "civilians have the same kind of ranking", "57:25", "Charter that that the brass does so SES", "57:27", "three SAS three would be the same thing", "57:30", "as a three-star general so alright", "57:32", "that's what if that's who these people", "57:33", "are around me so I had the head of the", "57:35",

life they an hour involved the way", "57:56", "you're doing the way they are current", "57:59", "consultants to the Internet the", "58:00", "intelligence community okay that's a", "58:03", "probably the man involved in this", "58:04", "project with clearance they they all", "58:07", "have their top-secret SAT SSDI", "58:10", "clearances yeah I'm the only one that", "58:11", "does it on my entire team I'm the only", "58:13", "one that does actually loo that just", "58:16", "came out I hired him away so he was head", "58:18", "of all he was in charge of all", "58:22", "classified operations for secretary", "58:27", "defence mattis so he was what's called a", "58:29", "gs-15 right underneath the one two three", "58:32", "stars", "58:32", "he ran the advanced aerial FET program", "58:36", "and it's still continuing to this day", "58:38", "and he's with us now so the advanced", "58:40", "aerial threat program under the United", "58:42", "States government is essentially a UFO", "58:44",

"58:58", "people are witnessing but there's also a", "59:00", "very large group of people that have had", "59:02", "within government that have had close", "59:05", "contact like hundreds and it's connected", "59:07", "to my group and there's just more coming", "59:09", "in that way so that that program is", "59:11", "trying to figure out what those", "59:14", "technologies did to those people and how", "59:18", "those technologies work even though in", "59:22", "its more saddle it's more about tasking", "59:24", "you know our assets like satellites and", "59:27", "other things to be able to find these", "59:28", "things better but um this is different", "59:31", "than the secret machines book which is", "59:34", "more of another thing also is their", "59:36", "communication between the United States", "59:38", "government and alien life-forms I I", "59:41", "personally I mean I don't know any of", "59:43", "the stuff because I'm not invited to", "59:45", "those types of meetings but I personally", "59:47", "wouldn't doubt it yeah you wouldn't", "59:49", "doubt it but they've never", "59:50", "alluded to it or discussed it with you", "59:52", "in any way not yet not this group of", "59:54", "people no is there any speculation as to", "59:56", "what they're doing resource extraction", "59:59", "resource extraction Lamar like minerals", "60:01", "entire building I tell people arm these", "60:03", "no I think it's changed I did think it's", "60:06", "tacos I think you know they're here for", "60:10", "the same reason I am but I tell people", "60:12", "like a good way to look at this is like", "60:14", "look at Syria and Syria's and chaos", "60:17", "because the United States and Russia are", "60:19", "having a proxy war there now look at the", "60:22", "earth it's the exact same thing", "60:24", "different races are coming here and and", "60:27", "they're trying to win and against each", "60:29", "other one oh yeah yeah we're talking", "60:33", "about all right I don't know how many I", "60:34", "don't know but there's a bunch of", "60:35", "different creatures and they all have", "60:36", "the same sort of technology yeah and", "60:37", "some are very human some are looked just", "60:39", "like you and I really absolutely yeah", "60:43", "now is there any sort of speculation as", "60:45", "to why life-forms from other planets", "60:47", "other galaxies of the solar system's", "60:49", "different kind of gravity different", "60:51", "environments would create a life-form", "60:52", "that's exactly similar to us or are they", "60:55", "imitating what we look like in order to", "60:57", "infiltrate our world and hang with us", "61:00", "I think probably following I think all", "61:03", "the above I mean look if you look at if", "61:05", "you look at like Syria are you just", "61:07", "gonna say it's only Russia and America", "61:09", "there are China's probably there France", "61:11", "is probably there you know yeah I", "61:14", "personally think the little the little", "61:16", "aliens of the big black eyes those are", "61:18", "androids they're biological robots", "61:20", "they're just programmed there's no", "61:22", "different than us cloning sheep they", "61:24", "just clone a being that can travel", "61:25", "through space cuz space or some sort of", "61:27", "artificial intelligence thing that it is", "61:29", "a life-form right I've heard that idea", "61:32", "before and it kind of kind of makes", "61:34", "sense a little bit right I mean if if", "61:36", "you're a living thing and you're", "61:38", "traveling through space obviously you", "61:40", "have biological limitations in terms of", "61:42", "the need for oxygen and gravitational", "61:45", "interactions and all these different", "61:47", "things that one of the scariest", "61:48", "hallmarks of those ones the the room or", "61:51", "is it in the back of their head as a", "61:52", "transmitter so you got to wonder where", "61:54", "it's sending shit but at the same time", "61:56", "you know I can tell you that when you", "61:58", "look at the Bible the angels and the", "62:00", "demons of the Bible would be the humans", "62:02", "androids that I just told you about so", "62:06", "you think the greys are the androids", "62:07", "right so you think they're like some", "62:08", "sort of devil no I just think that", "62:11", "that's how we characterized it because", "62:13", "they come in control your thoughts", "62:15", "control your body - yeah demons you know", "62:18", "um so do you think these things are", "62:21", "traveling from where do we have any idea", "62:23", "there's things that have been put out", "62:25", "there but I've never asked why would you", "62:27", "not ask them what the fuck I did tell me", "62:28", "star system like 483 and what you know", "62:30", "about element 115 I would want to know", "62:33", "about Starship Enterprise coordinate 115", "62:36", "nine six five Polaris wherever the fuck", "62:40", "it is yeah I don't know I don't know I", "62:43", "do know that there's Collette there's", "62:44", "connections - um man you won't even", "62:48", "fucking believe it I'll tell you that", "62:49", "please", "62:49", "Atlantis Atlantis the sunken city yeah", "62:54", "there's a connection there's a", "62:55", "connection what's the connection that", "62:57", "there is a very advanced group that left", "62:59", "after a catastrophe and hung around in a", "63:02", "small outpost here and and throughout", "63:05", "time would push civilization forward and", "63:07", "not so the Greek gods were whoa yeah and", "63:11", "that's why it's very interesting when", "63:12", "the Roswell wreckage there's Greek", "63:14", "writing is there there is I've never", "63:17", "seen any of the wreckage from Roswell", "63:18", "view it's online yes yeah type in", "63:21", "Roswell wreckage you can see it whatever", "63:23", "scene as the dude standing in front of", "63:24", "the bullshit the weather balloons stuff", "63:26", "look laughing yucking it up Roswell", "63:28", "wreckage Roswell I beam you'll see it", "63:30", "and uh and it's got these Greek markings", "63:33", "as far and the witnesses that were there", "63:34", "did did what do you call it where they", "63:39", "go on seiyya on oath until so that", "63:42", "actual eye beam showing the word LF", "63:45", "theory which means freedom in ancient", "63:48", "Greek so I saw it from Jamie let me tell", "63:52", "you why I keep me popped up with it well", "63:55", "I'm going to tell you something else so", "63:57", "I went and met a former director of CIA", "64:01", "and NSA he was director of both I won't", "64:04", "tell you his name and right when I sat", "64:06", "down and told him about my book pull the", "64:08", "picture up again lose little hands and", "64:09", "right when I sat down and told him about", "64:10", "my you gotta this is a big deal okay", "64:12", "so I'm sitting with this guy he was like", "64:16", "not that long ago was director of CIA", "64:19", "and he went on to be director of NSA", "64:21", "okay well I think we can find his name", "64:23", "maybe but uh right when I sat down and", "64:26", "told him about the book you know what he", "64:27", "says to me what he goes I didn't read", "64:29", "much science fiction as a kid but I've", "64:30", "read a lot about Greek mythology and", "64:32", "looked me in the eye said well you're", "64:34", "gonna love the last page in my book then", "64:35", "he's all mi and when my book was about", "64:40", "ready to go to pressing I had a very", "64:42", "important person call me up he says can", "64:44", "you stop that pressing and maybe insert", "64:46", "something about Greek mythology and I", "64:48", "said I sure can so once something you", "64:50", "got to realize is for example the sixth", "64:54", "biggest defense contractor in the world", "64:56", "at least the u.s. b6 is it kind of", "64:59", "called science applications", "65:00", "international corporation SAIC their", "65:02", "headquarters are actually in San Diego", "65:03", "and in the front of the building you", "65:06", "have a an oblique

8-foot tall statues it's", "65:19", "fucking nuts by the way in SAIC they", "65:23", "just they win over Toledo's Michael", "65:25", "Hayden former director of NSA and the", "65:27", "CIA what about it no that's I am hmm but", "65:30", "I'm not gonna I'm not gonna tell you if", "65:32", "you try and find out okay you guys are", "65:33", "fishing around over here I'll say a name", "65:35", "you blink yeah I'll show you my dick", "65:42", "like if you whatever you get I'm gonna", "65:48", "show you my dick what do you think about", "65:52", "all that zecharia sitchin stuff I think", "65:54", "he was close I don't think he was exact", "65:56", "but its interpretive you know if I was", "65:57", "to show you some symbols for people who", "65:59", "don't know what that is", "66:00", "zecharia sitchin is a Palestinian", "66:02", "scholar that decoded a lot of ancient", "66:04", "Sumerian texts are written in Akkadian", "66:07", "sumar\u00e9 was like kind of the first", "66:09",

different shit they knew all the", "66:19", "planets they said there's an extra", "66:21", "planet but zecharia sitchin was the was", "66:23", "the one that really spent a lot of time", "66:24",

the the", "66:34", "flood of Noah like all that shit but his", "66:36", "take on it was those who from heaven to", "66:39", "earth came called them angels but they", "66:42", "were an advanced race they fucked around", "66:44", "with genetics well that was the his take", "66:46", "on the definition of Nephilim was the", "66:49", "was yeah what you find you find that in", "66:52", "Genesis the

day I think it's the closest thing", "67:05", "we got and in my early conversations", "67:06", "when I was speaking when I was being", "67:09", "given some interesting science fiction", "67:10",

interesting and I can't", "67:22", "remember his name but it fired so quick", "67:24", "when I asked the question it came right", "67:26", "back with this whole thing on this one", "67:27", "Sumerian king really interesting", "67:30", "well what's fascinating about them is", "67:32", "that they really did know a lot about", "67:33", "our solar system can you think about the", "67:36", "fact they're around five thousand years", "67:37", "ago they had a detailed model of the", "67:39", "solar system with all the planets and", "67:41", "they were all relatively close in size", "67:44",

interesting we", "68:28", "were really smart and then we went kind", "68:30", "of backwards you know and and there's", "68:32", "probably a bit more to that story too", "68:34", "that hopefully one day we'll get into it", "68:36", "well it's just it's really interesting", "68:38", "when you look at these ancient", "68:39", "civilizations and their attempts to", "68:42", "decipher the world

image of", "69:19", "the Anunnaki when they show the solar", "69:21", "system because the image is really", "69:22", "fascinating because it is what it is I", "69:24", "mean you look at it this there's a Sun I", "69:26", "mean it's clearly a Sun it has like it's", "69:29", "a large circle it's in the sky and it", "69:32", "has like those little Sun sort of raised", "69:34", "around this

in the early 90s JPL announced", "69:46", "that they thought they found a companion", "69:47", "to our Sun yeah look at that I mean", "69:49", "that's fucking radical right there yeah", "69:51", "that's crazy", "69:51", "they have Pluto in there now go to the", "69:54", "discovery of Pluto when when did Pluto", "69:57", "get discovered I think you're right I", "69:58", "think it was in the

looking at", "70:50", "with the naked eye observe because", "70:55", "windows there was a bunch of telescopes", "70:56", "already set up Friday but that makes", "70:58", "sense for telescopes but why

that you're in this", "71:16", "unit you guys are talking about naked", "71:18", "and Uranus a lot here and I don't want", "71:20", "to make any jokes I'm not but I'm just", "71:21", "telling you we're talking about see your", "71:22", "ass with your naked eye this week giggle", "71:24", "if you must know what a goofy name -", "71:28", "like what all the different sounds you", "71:30", "can make with your face and they chose", "71:32", "your butthole what if they just call it", "71:34", "Buttle yeah butthole planet but all be", "71:36", "just as I would go there fucking crazy", "71:39",

off on Mars because the the the", "72:17", "radioactive signature is can only happen", "72:20", "if you explode a nuclear weapon that's", "72:23", "artificially made not like a like", "72:24",

he's a", "72:42", "big time dude", "72:43", "and he thinks there was nuclear war yeah", "72:45", "he did huge well he doesn't say that he", "72:48", "just says that nuclear weapons he just", "72:50", "says we have this signature he all", "72:53", "peer-reviewed science that the signature", "72:55", "of the radioactive activity from this", "72:59", "very specific isotope that only comes", "73:01",

somehow another Mars was impacted", "73:11", "there's something hit it like some sort", "73:12", "of raster or oil impact and it destroyed", "73:14", "the environment I think it's the NIF you",

was", "73:25", "wacky as fuck like he was one of the", "73:28", "who's that one of the main proponents of", "73:30", "the face on Mars and all the pyramids", "73:32", "that they found on Mars they would find", "73:34", "these weird yeah connections between one", "73:36", "point to another point and somehow or", "73:38", "another they made some arbitrary", "73:39", "distinctions that those were

to him and he's already", "74:07", "got SpaceX once you guys the second", "74:10", "thing we're doing he might really", "74:11", "actually be interested in and so the two", "74:13", "aerospace projects to the stars is doing", "74:15", "one is we're building something that", "74:17", "will in effect be anti-gravity but it's", "74:20", "actually that's actually not the", "74:21", "mechanism it does in building a", "74:23", "spacecraft but the second thing that", "74:24", "we're doing is called beamed energy", "74:25", "propulsion which is something I think", "74:26", "musk will be very interested in it's", "74:28", "launching cube SATs with lasers so the", "74:31", "Air Force Research Lab kind of broke", "74:33", "this science back in the 90s and a bunch", "74:37", "of people associated with that program", "74:38", "got it Declassified and they're working", "74:41", "for us on building it so it'll take a", "74:43", "handful of years to do but what you do", "74:46", "is you use very strong either microwaves", "74:48", "or some other kind of wave and it", "74:49", "ignites and explodes the air underneath", "74:52", "a mechanism that carries a CubeSat and", "74:54", "so essentially what what happens is is", "74:57", "you don't use any fossil fuels and it", "74:59", "can bring the cost of launching a", "75:01", "CubeSat from like 50 grand down to five", "75:03", "grand it's like crazy so that means", "75:05", "colleges and neighbors and and anyone", "75:08", "else can launch cube SATs quite easily", "75:10", "now if you had any debates with people", "75:12",

propulsion", "75:21", "space and elements and all that shit um", "75:23", "no I have it I wouldn't be able to", "75:26", "debate a physicist but they can read all", "75:27", "the papers you know right but I mean has", "75:29", "anybody been skeptical yeah everyone's", "75:32", "like oh yeah and what's your response to", "75:34", "that you don't know what I know right", "75:36", "well you know though I can't I don't", "75:38", "know I can't tell you some of the shit", "75:40", "that I know and I can't tell you but", "75:42", "what could it be that's so crazy if you", "75:44", "you know I mean what you've said well", "75:46", "think about what you've said you said", "75:48", "that there's some ridiculous sort of", "75:50", "propulsion system that allows you to", "75:52", "move through

all these things that", "76:11", "you said what could possibly be crazier", "76:12", "than that well you're asking me how do I", "76:15", "know", "76:15", "and no no I'm asking you what do you", "76:17", "know that could possibly be crazier than", "76:19", "that well I that's the shit I can't tell", "76:22", "you it's not everything's hunky-dory", "76:24", "is it something were you worried about", "76:26", "the fate of the human race I think", "76:27", "that's part of it where should I move", "76:29", "move it's not existence rip your dick", "76:32", "out if I should go to Australia I mean", "76:40", "where's the spot I don't think there is", "76:42", "one unavoidable spot this is what I will", "76:45", "say there it's not existential in the", "76:46", "sense of they're not gonna come here", "76:48", "like Independence Day and nuke the place", "76:50", "but they're you know there are things to", "76:53", "worry about and that's why I think do", "76:56", "you think there's anybody that's famous", "76:57", "that's an alien", "76:58", "oh I don't know do you think there's any", "77:00", "influential figure that has been sort of", "77:03", "shaping culture that might not be one of", "77:05", "us Oprah for sure it has to be Oprah", "77:08", "yeah but if you go back to the early", "77:10", "days when Oprah's do that stupid show we", "77:11", "should have like KKK members on", "77:13", "everybody sat on white plastic seats", "77:15", "when were those days it's not Geraldo is", "77:17", "that Oprah Oprah or early days man me", "77:19", "and Al magic oh I'll never forget this", "77:21", "it was like when I first met al probably", "77:24", "like late 90s I think we were in San", "77:27", "Francisco doing bong hits watching TV", "77:31", "and Oprah was on and it was old Oprah", "77:34", "narrow Brera hair oprah find out about", "77:38", "the 90s might have been early to", "77:39", "thousands of aliens from men and black", "77:40", "they were watching at the beginning", "77:42", "member yeah you know i don't know i mean", "77:45", "i again there's there's elements of this", "77:47", "subject that are that are disturbing and", "77:50", "you know I don't think people need to", "77:51", "know all that shit", "77:52", "so do you subscribe to the idea that", "77:55", "human beings are the product of genetic", "77:56", "engineering I do yes so you think that", "77:59", "they took some lower hominids and that", "78:01", "they did something to them to create", "78:03", "human beings that is a very popular", "78:05", "theory among UFO fanatics well and ie", "78:08", "boat A's I I don't want to speak again", "78:11", "for my company but one of the people on", "78:13", "our board scientific they call it a SAP", "78:16", "scientific advisory

what he can prove with science he's", "78:34", "not going to speculate right now so what", "78:36", "what makes people think that like what's", "78:38", "the science that makes people think that", "78:40", "well there's a lot of junk DNA there's", "78:42", "certain parts of our DNA that seems to", "78:43", "have been turned off there's there's a", "78:46", "bunch of things in there that we don't", "78:49", "understand and we don't have the leaps", "78:51", "of humanity over the past five thousand", "78:54", "years to really show like where did what", "78:57", "happened in the past 5,000 years that", "79:00", "wasn't happening for the hundreds of", "79:01", "millions of years before that they just", "79:03", "found a footprint that was on like 100", "79:06", "million years old or something like that", "79:07", "that was just a human footprint but they", "79:10", "did yeah I just don't know I don't know", "79:12", "I can't remember but it's like a fossil", "79:14", "and now they're like fuck this totally", "79:15", "throws everything upside down I'm", "79:17", "talking to Sarah Palin that was", "79:18", "something to say about Palin said", "79:20", "remember that like there was a librarian", "79:21", "that said that she she didn't believe", "79:23", "that she was a young earth creationist", "79:26", "she thought that there was a picture", "79:28", "online that showed a human footprint", "79:30", "inside a dinosaur footprint that", "79:32", "approved that people walked with", "79:33", "Dinosaurs I wouldn't doubt it i I think", "79:35", "out that people walk with darkness oh", "79:37", "not at all I think there's been cycles", "79:38", "of civilizations and I think the people", "79:41", "on the inside know that and that's why", "79:43", "at that defense contractor multi Multi", "79:46", "multi multi-billion dollar defense", "79:47", "cotton the one", "79:48", "that shows the government of Iraq after", "79:50", "we took over Iraq and the ones looked", "79:52", "over after all of our nukes hey looky", "79:54", "there", "79:54", "they had inside a dinosaur footprint", "79:56", "she's right but they have on but they", "79:59", "have at that place remember I told you", "80:01", "they have the past in the future with", "80:03", "big pyramids in their hands let regions", "80:05", "you know that they're try it's like it's", "80:07", "a spooky when you look at that do you", "80:09", "believe that the asteroid hit the", "80:11", "Yucatan caused a mass extinction that", "80:13", "killed off most of the life on the", "80:14", "planet I don't know I can't believe me I", "80:16", "don't know fuck I've never studied that", "80:18", "shit and I wasn't there but that mean", "80:19", "it's like physical evidence for that", "80:21", "it's more like ability well yeah but I", "80:22", "haven't read anything about it but sure", "80:23", "okay I mean I can believe in things I", "80:26", "can't prove a lot of things you know", "80:27", "right but that's like the whole reason", "80:28", "why we were supposedly here that it", "80:30", "killed off the dinosaurs and allowed", "80:32", "whatever that they think there was some", "80:34", "sort of a mole mole type creature that", "80:37", "evolved over 65 million years because", "80:39", "bullshit I think it's all bullshit I", "80:41", "think you think evolutions bullshit", "80:42", "um no I think that at some point in", "80:45", "history", "80:46", "they came someone came here and tampered", "80:48", "with existing creatures and made us and", "80:50", "upgraded us at very specific and

was like the", "81:01", "beginning right most scientists not we", "81:03", "I'm too stupid for this but obviously", "81:06", "somehow or another that became a bird", "81:08", "right why couldn't it become a monkey", "81:10", "why could that monkey become a person I", "81:12", "think it yeah I don't know I mean look", "81:14", "evolution changes I mean we could we", "81:16", "know that people that like beat their", "81:19", "kids their kids DNA changes based on", "81:21", "getting beat you know so when you were", "81:23", "fighting you were changing people's DNA", "81:25", "and you were a geneticist you know you", "81:27", "went after it for science you know", "81:30", "that's why we were doing the fighting", "81:32", "right lab coat on so if you if you think", "81:35", "about it that way if you think about", "81:37", "that all life somehow or another", "81:39", "continues to evolve an advanced and", "81:42", "through natural selection genetic", "81:44", "mutation and random

that it used to be", "81:57", "something different and now it's that", "81:58", "sure why wouldn't that be the case of", "82:00", "people - I think that", "82:02", "is the case with people I just think", "82:03", "that the quantum leaps in our evolution", "82:06", "are symptoms or effects of being", "82:10", "genetically upgraded the way I've heard", "82:12", "it explained to me though is that

that", "86:01", "Israel and it is happening and lay it in", "86:04", "a way that's grounded in practical and", "86:07", "but still moves you and then follow up", "86:10", "with the science and then

actual real elements that", "86:52", "actually exist yep and then eventually", "86:55", "what what's the end game well the end", "86:57", "game is to the technology itself is like", "87:00", "so when you make when you when you", "87:04", "create this energy source the power is a", "87:06", "spacecraft it's called an overunity", "87:07", "machine so it puts out more power than", "87:10", "what's

as", "87:49", "if the public owns it and we build it", "87:51", "from scratch by the public why is the", "87:53", "public have to own it because well I", "87:54", "guess you could be in a way a private", "87:56", "person but the technology it probably", "87:59", "has an element of what they call eminent", "88:01", "domain so we're gonna get to a certain", "88:02", "point where certain agencies will", "88:05", "probably knock on our door and go what", "88:06", "the fuck are you doing and we're gonna", "88:07", "say the public owns this you can't take", "88:10", "it from them they're gonna say fuck yeah", "88:11", "we can take it we're gonna say we're", "88:12", "gonna work something out because it's", "88:14", "like building a nuclear bomb in your", "88:15", "basement kind of thing so so when you", "88:17", "say the public owns it like how will", "88:19", "that be possible how the how the public", "88:21", "owned it the you can go to our we've we", "88:24", "reserved a small amount of shares of the", "88:26", "company that people can buy stock in the", "88:28", "company right now so a year ago this is", "88:31", "not the public that's private", "88:33", "it's no

wanted to democratize", "88:44", "going public with companies just like an", "88:47", "IPO but not spend millions of dollars", "88:49", "and do it so they launched what's called", "88:51", "a regulation a direct public offering", "88:53", "and we had a file with the SEC so we had", "88:56", "to spend hundreds of thousands of", "88:57", "dollars to do this and we spent the last", "88:59", "six months doing it and our live event", "89:01", "launched that so you can go to change", "89:03", "you did this just so that you can tell", "89:06", "the whoever the fuck it is that will", "89:08", "come after you that hey the public owns", "89:10", "this you can't take this that's one", "89:12", "element of everything that we're doing", "89:14", "yeah that so your anticipate you're", "89:17", "spending hundreds of thousands of", "89:18", "dollars to anticipate someone coming in", "89:20", "and closing the doors and they yet", "89:22", "you're talking about it in advance", "89:24", "we're like you're essentially telling", "89:26", "strategizing that you know but you're", "89:28", "letting them know that you know that", "89:29", "they're gonna come and get it be much", "89:31", "harder to shut it down when the whole", "89:32", "world has paid for it invested in it", "89:34", "owns it and so you try to get people to", "89:37", "buy things", "89:38", "I'm trying what we mean you try to get", "89:39", "people to buy stock well yeah right now", "89:42", "we're public you can buy shares of the", "89:43", "company you can only we only put up a", "89:45", "very limited amount that we only put I", "89:47", "think we only put up five five million", "89:49", "shares or so so that seems like a lot of", "89:51", "chairs how many shares are there all", "89:52", "others looks like a hundred million", "89:54", "probably or something like a hundred how", "89:56", "does that Cher's work shares like you", "89:58", "just work like say if we came up with", "90:00", "young Jamie incorporated yeah and we", "90:02", "wanted to start selling shares when you", "90:04", "file as a corporation you can issue", "90:06", "shares and you can sell those shares to", "90:08", "people and those shares have a price", "90:10", "based on you know how you want to value", "90:13", "your company you know okay so you could", "90:15", "have like a hundred million shares of", "90:16", "young Jamie incorporated yep you sure", "90:18", "again okay and so then the government", "90:20", "can't shut you down bro yeah well you", "90:23", "guys maybe because you you say a lot", "90:24", "about words no no no Jamie doesn't but", "90:26", "I'm warmin we do a lot at the company", "90:29", "right so we're building essentially a", "90:31", "science fiction version of Disney okay", "90:33", "so we have four film franchises not all", "90:35", "of them about UFOs one is kind of this", "90:38", "Blade Runner night all about nightmares", "90:40", "kind of thing one is like an old Amblin", "90:43", "Spielberg who's making these things oh", "90:45", "we are I mean who's writing them I wrote", "90:47", "the first one I'm directing that", "90:49", "you're directing too I wrote this script", "90:52", "and you multi-talented motherfucker look", "90:54", "I'm that's where I'm going with most of", "90:56", "this stuff but the company I had to get", "90:58", "up and get going and set it up and we", "90:59", "bring in a CEO this is my kind of shit", "91:01", "that's a bizarre formula right an", "91:03", "entertainment company that's also gonna", "91:05", "do aerospace and science well the heart", "91:08", "of it is when we do what's called", "91:10", "confirmation not disclosure confirmation", "91:13", "uh-huh the heart of it is is how do we", "91:15", "tell stories that galvanize the human", "91:17", "race and let them know a little bit more", "91:19", "but what's going on and how do we", "91:21", "present them science so they understand", "91:23", "that consciousness and a lot of other", "91:24", "things are real and how do we build a", "91:27", "technology associated with those stories", "91:30", "and with those science that can change", "91:31", "the world and that's why it's an academy", "91:33", "do they have any pickled bodies anywhere", "91:35", "from malya Hyde I believe they did yeah", "91:38", "you believe they didn't nobody's ever", "91:39", "told you that I believe together I", "91:41", "believe they do you believe they do you", "91:43", "can't say any more than I'm not gonna", "91:44", "say any more than that she said so much", "91:47", "I know I know what you can and can't say", "91:49", "well I could tell you other shit offline", "91:51", "probably okay offline I can't wait to", "91:53", "end this podcast kick me out anybody", "91:56", "play some weird shit so now what what's", "92:00", "the timeline for moving forward with all", "92:01", "this stuff okay so in the next few weeks", "92:04", "we're going to be releasing the first", "92:05", "declassify videos of these advanced", "92:08", "aerial threat UFOs and they are current", "92:11", "videos that were just caught and with", "92:13", "audio and everything of the people", "92:14", "tracking them and we're gonna launch the", "92:17", "beta version of the community of", "92:18", "interest which is the partnered website", "92:19", "that's going to be hosting all this", "92:20", "Declassified information where we're", "92:22", "gonna be having the hard core", "92:25", "conversations with people that want to", "92:28", "understand the stuff we're going to be", "92:30", "also doing an experiment with that piece", "92:32", "of metal to show the world that the", "92:34", "technology is not only real but its it's", "92:37", "demonstratable and the videos are very", "92:40", "much a proof of concept you know it was", "92:42", "showing you look at works you know so", "92:44", "we're going to build it and do you think", "92:46", "it's gonna be weird for people to take", "92:47", "you seriously because you're a rock star", "92:49", "like maybe were like some sort of a", "92:50", "physicist maybe scientists I would", "92:53", "listen to you more well you know I", "92:54", "remember when Elon came out years ago", "92:56", "and he started SpaceX and then he", "92:59", "started Tesla here's this dude's saying", "93:01", "all this ambitious shit", "93:03", "I didn't buy any of it I think guys a", "93:04", "hundred times smarter than the both of", "93:05", "us combined he's fuckin gnarly I know", "93:07", "but I'm just saying he caught Issa", "93:09", "lievable once a year maybe maybe I think", "93:11", "he is I mean shit he's badass but look", "93:13", "at the people you what's interesting to", "93:15", "me is you haven't seen who are with have", "93:18", "you looked at the BIOS on the shit no", "93:20", "yeah you got to read the BIOS of the", "93:22", "people I wanted I didn't want to be", "93:23", "tainted I wanted to talk to well one of", "93:25", "the on my on mice at the scientific", "93:29", "board advisory board is you know one of", "93:31", "the guys at CIA that headed up the", "93:33", "entire bio warfare program in the", "93:35", "Director of Operations a clandestine", "93:36", "division so all these guys have found", "93:37", "use how various ways so they've come to", "93:41", "you because they you're like the beacon", "93:43", "I I did some things as this is the way", "93:46", "to go", "93:46", "I did something that no one thought was", "93:48", "possible what's that was tying together", "93:51", "a mechanism that can perpetually fund", "93:54", "itself and can communicate and can", "93:59", "innovate all with people that sit at it", "94:02", "see I created a roundtable with", "94:05", "engineers scientists until high-ranking", "94:07", "intelligence officials and and some", "94:10", "others I can't tell you about obviously", "94:12", "and the this in the defense world", "94:15", "it's called stovepiping so when they", "94:17", "when they compartmentalize a secret they", "94:20", "put them into these vertical categories", "94:22", "that can't talk to each other I created", "94:24", "a horizontal structure where all these", "94:26", "people in these amazing accomplished", "94:29", "positions and government were able to", "94:31", "come together at the same table and they", "94:34", "can discuss what we want to teach the", "94:37", "world and how we want to do that and but", "94:39", "the but the way to do that is including", "94:43", "the public and making it a public", "94:44", "benefit corporation and what that means", "94:46", "is we're able to spend money and it's in", "94:49", "our Charter on things that can benefit", "94:51", "the world and not just provide a return", "94:52", "to the investors but what we're doing", "94:54", "happens to be extremely lucrative my my", "94:58", "engine lucrative for investors our", "95:00", "investors and the company sews it like", "95:02", "save young Jamie wants to be a part of", "95:04", "it what is it what is you have to do you", "95:05", "just go to the Stars Academy comm and", "95:07", "you buy shares whatever you want to buy", "95:09", "and I will be lucrative for him because", "95:11", "the first of all the technology it sells", "95:14", "like a trillion dollar thing it", "95:15", "we can figure that out over the next", "95:17", "eight years and they think we can so", "95:19", "they who's they", "95:20", "the the engineers that are building this", "95:21", "thing the guy so Steve Justice that was", "95:24", "head of advanced programs of the skunk", "95:25", "works we talked about that they build", "95:27", "all of our they are the tip of the spear", "95:29", "for the most advanced spacecraft an", "95:32", "aircraft that the United States national", "95:34", "security apparatus has period period", "95:36", "hands down and he was the big boy there", "95:40", "and their model we we think we have us", "95:44", "you know this is a this is a guess but I", "95:47", "think there's a 60% chance within thirty", "95:49", "six months or so we'll be able to", "95:51", "demonstrate something pretty kick-ass", "95:53", "and as long as there's no major obstacle", "95:56", "there we think within eight years we'll", "95:58", "be able to have something but it's", "95:59", "expensive and we got to work with the", "96:01", "government and we're gonna have to work", "96:02", "with major aerospace for example this", "96:04", "one meeting I have coming up with with a", "96:06", "big-name aerospace company is offering", "96:09", "their material sciences division we need", "96:11", "that we need to be able to create", "96:12", "certain metals that can resonate in", "96:15", "certain certain frequencies shit like", "96:16", "that the other way that the company", "96:18", "makes money is when we build this the", "96:21", "the satellite launching system that's", "96:23", "like exactly what Elon is doing now", "96:25", "putting satellites in orbit but we don't", "96:27", "have to build rockets we can launch them", "96:29", "with lasers that's a big deal you point", "96:32", "lasers at the bottom of a CubeSat which", "96:33", "is like the size of a shoebox and you", "96:35", "could put it into low-earth orbit and", "96:37", "you can put it up even higher without", "96:39", "using any fossil fuels with using light", "96:40", "that's a big deal that's a multi-billion", "96:42", "dollar gimmick right there it's just", "96:44", "been proven yeah I told you seeing a", "96:47", "proof that there's this video of this", "96:49", "happen yeah it's it's in our launch", "96:50", "video if you watch the video at the top", "96:52", "of the to the stars Academy comm page", "96:54", "you'll see shots of it where little", "96:56", "things glowing and it's getting beamed", "96:57", "up into the sky that's the Air Force", "96:59", "yeah my guys were on that project", "97:01", "little things glowing but yeah like mass", "97:03", "though like a satellite yeah yeah", "97:06", "they're called CubeSat you know to", "97:07", "CubeSat is no a CubeSat is a modular box", "97:10", "that you you put together as modules", "97:13", "based on what you need okay I need a", "97:14", "thruster", "97:15", "I need a sensor and I need a fucking RF", "97:18", "signal thing to send the data back home", "97:20", "so now I got three little boxes attached", "97:22", "that's a CubeSat they call them cubes so", "97:24", "it's essentially it's probably 80% of", "97:29", "satellite business but now they got to", "97:32", "put all these Cube sets together on", "97:34", "Musk's rocket that's also launching", "97:37", "giant satellites for DoD or whatever but", "97:40", "it's super expensive because you have a", "97:42", "rocket and you have all that fossil", "97:43", "fuels and all this stuff if you launch", "97:45", "these cube SATs with lasers because", "97:47", "they're not that heavy and you can like", "97:49", "I said it would take a cost of launching", "97:51", "a CubeSat from 50 grand a pound down to", "97:53", "five grand that's a huge it so the idea", "97:56", "of this actually happening that's on", "97:57", "your what's the to the Stars Academy", "98:00", "com1 it is and you can watch that you", "98:02", "can watch the video and then you go to", "98:05", "the entertainment division which is my", "98:06", "primary spot you know making movies and", "98:10", "selling millions of books and licensing", "98:12", "the stuff out is the differ is the", "98:13", "reason why Disney's 300 billion and", "98:15", "Warner Brothers is five billion Warner", "98:17", "Brothers just makes movies Disney's make", "98:19", "Frant they make franchises and they're", "98:21", "vertically integrated we put out the", "98:22", "book we put out the t-shirts we make the", "98:24", "movie so that's really where we're going", "98:27", "and we have we have three television", "98:29", "series that are probably one of which", "98:34", "will be announced probably in the next", "98:35", "couple weeks the other two were a little", "98:36", "further out on that the first film our", "98:39", "first film is first quarter of next year", "98:41", "I wrote that one and I'll be directing", "98:43", "that one it's called strange times which", "98:45", "is like a hard-r version of The Goonies", "98:47", "but funny but scary and fucked up but", "98:50", "with 17 and 18 year old kids and then", "98:53", "and then secret machines the motion", "98:55", "picture that's these are all franchises", "98:57", "so strange times has an animated series", "98:59", "that's coming out we have a wonderful", "99:02", "writer from sorry at live that's show", "99:04", "running the thing we have an unscripted", "99:06", "show coming out on the entire company", "99:08", "just following us in a very National", "99:10", "Geographic way as we do
