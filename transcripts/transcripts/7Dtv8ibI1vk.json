["00:00", "all right here we go four three two", "00:07", "hello bill hi what's going on man", "00:10", "I am very excited to be here how much", "00:11", "sided to have you here excellent um the", "00:13", "social leap yes what's the social leap", "00:16", "I'll tell you all about it please do", "00:17", "okay so um the story that I want to tell", "00:20", "is basically how we got here how we", "00:22", "became human and so that story begins", "00:25", "about six or seven million years ago", "00:27", "when our ancestors left the rain forest", "00:30", "and so the question is why would they", "00:33", "leave and how would they survive once", "00:34", "they left and and that's what the social", "00:36", "leap is so it takes a second to get it", "00:38", "all out there okay yeah all right so", "00:41", "here's a story so if you look back about", "00:44", "seven million years", "00:45", "our ancestors and chimps we had a common", "00:48", "ancestor at about that point in time six", "00:50", "or seven million years ago and that", "00:52", "common ancestor we don't know exactly", "00:53", "what it looked like but it was from all", "00:55", "we can tell it was awfully close to", "00:57", "today's chimps and so there if you look", "01:00", "at gyms today you can get a pretty good", "01:01", "sense of what life was like then and", "01:02", "chimps today are really interesting", "01:04", "they're basically at the top of the food", "01:06", "chain in the rain forest they're super", "01:09", "fast up in the trees super athletic and", "01:12", "they because it traveled in groups even", "01:14", "amazing tree climbers like leopards", "01:16", "won't try to attack them in trees", "01:17", "it's just they it's they're too", "01:19", "dangerous too fast but if you look at a", "01:21", "chimp on the ground it can't even lock", "01:23", "its knees it's this kind of cute little", "01:24", "stumbled in a long thing and then the", "01:26", "question is why would an animal that", "01:28", "runs the show in the canopy leave the", "01:30", "rainforest for the savanna and then how", "01:32", "to survive once it did that and that's", "01:34", "that's the story of this book and then", "01:36", "how that manifests itself to where we", "01:37", "are today so really my goal I'm a", "01:40", "psychologist I want to understand why we", "01:42", "are the way we are and so in trying to", "01:45", "figure that out I said well let's take a", "01:46", "look back all the way to our common", "01:49", "ancestors and see some of the key events", "01:50", "and how they might have had an influence", "01:52", "on how we are today so the first", "01:54", "question is why would we leave the trees", "01:55", "right here we are where dominant", "01:57", "position where we're food on the ground", "02:00", "why would we ever take that risk and the", "02:02", "basic story there is the great African", "02:04", "Rift Valley I'm not sure if you've", "02:06", "you're familiar with it at all but", "02:07", "basically it runs down from up at the", "02:10", "Red Sea down to the coast of Mozambique", "02:12", "and", "02:13", "think of it like a Geographic zipper you", "02:15", "know all the world sits on these", "02:16", "tectonic plates and sometimes they crash", "02:18", "into each other like how India's", "02:21", "smashing into Asia and crates the", "02:22", "Himalayas", "02:23", "sometimes they literally tear apart and", "02:25", "Africa's tearing apart at the great", "02:26", "African Rift Valley", "02:27", "so that plate that has Somalian Ethiopia", "02:30", "Tanzania Kenya that's moving off to the", "02:32", "lower right the rest of Africa is moving", "02:34", "off to the upper left and I got no idea", "02:38", "why it's been going on for quite a while", "02:40", "but one of the consequences of that is", "02:41", "that the East Africa's starting to rise", "02:43", "up slowly bit by bit and when it rises", "02:46", "up the rainforests dry out and so", "02:49", "basically what you have is a situation", "02:50", "where our ancestors were on the east", "02:51", "side of that rift valley and it started", "02:54", "to dry out and now they're in a", "02:55", "situation where they've got this great", "02:57", "lifestyle their dominant position but", "02:59", "now they're pushed they're forced out on", "03:00", "to the ground increasingly more and more", "03:02", "because there's more and more ground and", "03:03", "less and less rainforest and so how do", "03:06", "they survive that what do they do in", "03:08", "order to make that work and this is a", "03:11", "what what period of time is this how", "03:13", "many millions of years ago six or seven", "03:15", "six or seven does this coincide with the", "03:18", "when when was the jump of the human", "03:21", "brain sighs well we'll get to that so", "03:23", "it's a super interesting question about", "03:25", "why that happened as well so basically", "03:26", "if you track us across the next three", "03:28", "million years how did our ancestors", "03:30", "survive when they're basically", "03:32", "chimpanzees on the open savanna and you", "03:35", "can get a hint of how they did it", "03:36", "because there's one chimpanzee group", "03:37", "that does live on the savanna in Senegal", "03:39", "and they they show some differences", "03:42", "between themselves and other chimps they", "03:44", "travel in slightly larger groups they", "03:46", "share and more nicely with each other", "03:48", "which is interesting that's kind of a", "03:49", "human trait as well and they also avoid", "03:52", "open space like they're just kind of", "03:54", "trying to stay near the trees as much as", "03:55", "possible and so and if you look at other", "03:58", "aids they're not AIDS but other primates", "04:00", "that are on the savanna like savanna", "04:02", "baboons they're only monkeys so they're", "04:04", "not as sharp as chimpanzees are but they", "04:06", "have a similar strategy large groups to", "04:08", "try to protect themselves and lots of", "04:10", "eyes to look out for predators and they", "04:11", "do fine on the savanna and so what I", "04:14", "suspect happen is for the first few", "04:16", "million years basically what you've got", "04:18", "is this chimp like an animal that's kind", "04:20", "of skirting the edges of Savannah and", "04:21", "nowhere near the top dominant position", "04:23", "they used to be and just kind of noodle", "04:25", "around and that takes I suspect that", "04:27", "takes us for about the first three three", "04:29", "and a half million years and if you look", "04:31", "at who we are then or Australopithecus", "04:34", "afarensis so it's if you looked at one", "04:36", "of them you'd think it belongs in a zoo", "04:38", "it looks almost like a chimpanzee and so", "04:40", "a chimp brain an answer to the first", "04:42", "part of your question is about 380 grams", "04:44", "an Australopithecus brain is about 450", "04:48", "grams so 3 million years of evolution", "04:50", "and all we've got forward is 70 grams so", "04:53", "why do we get so smart why do we take", "04:55", "off in the next few million years and", "04:57", "what is it that Australopithecus did", "04:59", "that that helped us survive and why do I", "05:01", "call that de socially then though I'm", "05:02", "kind of tied together and the basic", "05:05", "story is that by this point", "05:07", "Australopithecus has become bipedal and", "05:10", "we can talk about how that happened if", "05:11", "you'd like and so because they're", "05:13", "bipedal their waste is now stretched out", "05:15", "there their musculature like if you look", "05:18", "at chimpanzee pecks", "05:19", "they aim upward because of course chimps", "05:21", "climb and all the time Australopithecus", "05:23", "is more lateral like we are we're", "05:24", "basically completely lateral because", "05:26", "things are side to side as far as we're", "05:28", "concerned it's harder to climb a tree", "05:30", "but it's a whole lot easier to do a lot", "05:31", "of other things and we have much more", "05:34", "limber shoulder we have much more limber", "05:37", "wrists all that sort of thing and a lot", "05:39", "of that was in place by Australopithecus", "05:41", "so once they became bipedal they gained", "05:44", "a lot of these qualities and then the", "05:47", "question is why do those qualities", "05:48", "matter well the if you watch the", "05:50", "chimpanzee throw it's terrible at it", "05:52", "even though they're stronger than you", "05:54", "and I are pound for pound by a sizable", "05:55", "margin when they throw their inept they", "05:57", "can't gain very well and they typically", "05:59", "use two hands because they're not lined", "06:01", "up well to throw if you watch a really", "06:03", "good thrower like you know a gridiron a", "06:05", "football player a baseball player or", "06:07", "hunter-gatherer throw you know it's a", "06:08", "full body motion you step forward with", "06:10", "the other leg there's this rotation in", "06:12", "the very last minute you bring your", "06:13", "wrist through well what that does is it", "06:16", "creates an enormous amount of elastic", "06:17", "energy across your muscles tendons and", "06:19", "ligaments and the end of that throw for", "06:21", "a human is like the snapping of a rubber", "06:23", "band so chimps can't do that they're not", "06:27", "lined up properly but Australopithecus", "06:29", "got to the point where they could", "06:30", "probably do that pretty well and so now", "06:33", "and this purely a by-product or", "06:36", "bipedalism because it stretched out", "06:37", "their whole body and they don't", "06:39", "not climbing as much anymore so their", "06:40", "musculature is more lateral which would", "06:42", "have been help them for throwing so now", "06:44", "you get to a point where they have", "06:46", "access to the single most important", "06:48", "military invention in history which is", "06:50", "the capacity to kill at a distance so if", "06:53", "you and I are running around the", "06:54", "Savannah and a lion attacks us and we", "06:55", "got fifty of our best friends we could", "06:57", "kill it with our bare hands but a lot of", "06:59", "us are going to die in the process right", "07:01", "because you think 50 of us let's make it", "07:03", "a hundred that would you know and I'd be", "07:09", "super confident were people you wouldn't", "07:12", "worry very much but but even if we could", "07:15", "so we knew what we're doing we're all", "07:16", "armed with knives whoever goes in first", "07:18", "is screwed right right and so the", "07:20", "capacity kill at a distance though", "07:22", "allows a larger force of weaker", "07:24", "individuals to completely defeat a", "07:26", "stronger and so once they gain this", "07:29", "capacity to throw if they were attacked", "07:31", "by lions or something like that whereas", "07:32", "in the past they did just scattered for", "07:34", "the trees now they could throw stones at", "07:36", "it and defend themselves now an", "07:38", "Australopithecus throwing rocks at a", "07:39", "lion it's going to be in the belly of a", "07:41", "slightly annoyed lion in about three", "07:43", "minutes right right but fifty", "07:45", "australopithecines throwing rocks at", "07:47", "lions is a totally different story and", "07:48", "so it's this is the baddie here's the", "07:51", "throwing hypothesis that what what", "07:53", "changed everything was throwing and the", "07:55", "reason it changed everything is that it", "07:57", "caused us it was the first reason why we", "07:59", "should have any effective collective", "08:01", "action because it's not a good strategy", "08:03", "when you're on your own it's not a good", "08:05", "strategy if I do it and the rest of the", "08:06", "group hits heads for the trees but it's", "08:08", "a great strategy if we all do it", "08:10", "together yeah and so for the first time", "08:12", "in history the group's goals in our", "08:14", "history in our line the primate line the", "08:16", "group's goals aligned with the", "08:18", "individual goals which is let's", "08:19", "cooperate and work together to try to", "08:21", "drive away these predators mmm now it if", "08:26", "you look at a lion and you look at", "08:27", "someone throwing rocks it still seems", "08:28", "like a really big ask right to drive", "08:31", "that thing away or kill it throwing", "08:32", "rocks and so but Barbara Isaac was one", "08:35", "of the first anthropologists to propose", "08:37", "a hypothesis quite a while ago went back", "08:39", "and looked through the historical record", "08:40", "and these extraordinary stories of how", "08:42", "effective people are throwing rocks and", "08:44", "so in when the Portuguese went to the", "08:47", "Canary Islands to try to subjugate it", "08:49", "they rock up with you know armor", "08:52", "crossbows and this isn't a like 14", "08:55", "something and all the locals were on", "08:57", "with with stones and despite the fact", "08:59", "that the Portuguese are there in army", "09:00", "trained you know ready to shoot and and", "09:03", "in their armor they were just decimated", "09:05", "by the local stone rocks at them and", "09:06", "this store has happened over and over", "09:08", "again and when you read these accounts", "09:09", "they're extraordinary I can read you", "09:11", "some examples from here they just the", "09:13", "happen in Australia it happened in the", "09:15", "Canary Islands it happened elsewhere", "09:16", "they just saw rocks incredibly", "09:18", "accurately incredibly hard and really", "09:20", "fast hmm", "09:21", "so and there's you know accounts in", "09:23", "Africa basically killing a zebra with", "09:26", "one blow of a rock to the head hmm", "09:29", "so like a pitcher of major league", "09:32", "pitcher yeah exactly Drock right who", "09:35", "gets very accurate at it yeah so do you", "09:37", "think they they must have practiced", "09:39", "constantly yeah and so what I suspect is", "09:42", "it we evolved to like to throw rocks and", "09:44", "so if I look now if you look at my son", "09:45", "as a for example when he was 18 months", "09:48", "old we would be walking back toward", "09:49", "Alice if he saw a rock on the street", "09:51", "he'd pick it up and start trying to", "09:52", "throw it and my wife said no no don't", "09:54", "let him throw rocks it's only gonna", "09:55", "cause trouble first of all I'm thinking", "09:57", "well maybe I'll develop a good arm so", "09:58", "I'm gonna go ahead and let him anyway", "09:59", "but but secondly he freaking wants to", "10:02", "this is like something inherently fun", "10:03", "right and I think all humans enjoy", "10:07", "throwing and it's it's stunning how good", "10:09", "you can get it with practice so we were", "10:12", "at the Ohio State Fair because before my", "10:14", "son was born and I was walking by one of", "10:17", "these stalls where you can throw in a", "10:18", "radar gun and so I thought oh here's I", "10:20", "was just started to date my wife and I", "10:22", "thought out here's a perfect chance to", "10:23", "impress her right house how much I am so", "10:25", "I said hey why don't I stop and I'll", "10:26", "throw some balls here in this net cuz", "10:28", "I'd never throw I don't know how fast I", "10:29", "could so she's like sure and I was I", "10:32", "played like Little League right so I", "10:33", "throw the ball and it's like 50 miles an", "10:36", "hour and and she's pretty impressed", "10:37", "because that sounds fast right then this", "10:40", "like kid shows up next to me he's gotta", "10:42", "be 12 years old probably weighs 85", "10:44", "pounds this total gang come out a muscle", "10:46", "in his body and he just starts freaking", "10:48", "throwing ball after ball at like 65", "10:50", "miles an hour and I'm like fuck I mean", "10:52", "she's not gonna be impressed me this", "10:53", "like human twit next thing he's kicking", "10:55", "my ass right and so I picked up the last", "10:57", "ball i frickin throw it as hard as I can", "10:59", "hurts my shoulder flies off at an odd", "11:01", "angle doesn't hit anything and it's like", "11:03", "57 miles an hour", "11:04", "now that little guy who's like literally", "11:06", "the size of an Australopithecus was", "11:08", "thrown in 65 and hitting the target", "11:10", "every time and so it's obvious that it's", "11:12", "skill it's practice that would have made", "11:14", "you good at this and if your life", "11:15", "depends on it", "11:16", "you're gonna do it well that makes sense", "11:18", "coming from a martial arts background", "11:20", "like like coordinated movement where at", "11:24", "the end of it you snap does that make", "11:26", "sense that this technique is so critical", "11:29", "even you're a larger person someone with", "11:31", "better technique would have more of an", "11:33", "impact with that so the throwing arm", "11:36", "I had read this if that was one of the", "11:38", "hypothesis there's several hypothesis", "11:40", "why the human brain doubled over a", "11:43", "period of two million years another one", "11:44", "was cooked meat right", "11:46", "yeah they figured out a way to get more", "11:48", "nutrients out of meat that's rocking it", "11:50", "over fire right so that's a little bit", "11:52", "down the road so here we are three and a", "11:53", "half million years ago and so for the", "11:54", "first time we put some pressure on", "11:56", "ourselves to have an advantage to be", "11:57", "smarter so imagine you're a zebra you", "12:00", "know what the hell good is it to you to", "12:01", "be Einstein you got runs what are you", "12:03", "gonna do with that brain right but it's", "12:04", "a big it's a big cost our brains are 20%", "12:07", "of our metabolic energy whether we're", "12:09", "doing math or watching TV it spreads", "12:11", "constant drain and so what are our", "12:13", "ancestors why would they pay for that", "12:14", "drain now just recently there was a", "12:17", "paper that came out maybe three months", "12:19", "ago now on a new brain expansion gene", "12:22", "they found or they think that's what it", "12:24", "is called notch 2 NL and it turns out", "12:26", "about 1215 million years ago there was", "12:29", "an accidental duplication of that gene", "12:30", "on our genome and it but it was", "12:32", "ineffective and it just sat there doing", "12:33", "nothing now that's a great way that", "12:35", "evolution works where it accidentally", "12:37", "doubles a gene because then you know you", "12:38", "can mess with it and the old gene still", "12:40", "doing the job right mm-hmm so it sat", "12:42", "there for about nine million years in", "12:44", "our line till about three million years", "12:45", "ago around Australopithecus and then it", "12:47", "duplicated itself and it came online", "12:49", "again and what that gene seems to do is", "12:51", "it makes our brain remain as stem cells", "12:54", "for longer which means a lot more", "12:55", "duplication before they run away and", "12:57", "start becoming neurons and so if I had", "13:01", "to guess I'd say that that probably that", "13:04", "gene coming online", "13:05", "probably happened many times in the past", "13:06", "and every time it happen in the past it", "13:08", "was more cost than it was worth and so", "13:10", "what's the chimp gonna do with a little", "13:12", "bit more brain and just means more", "13:13", "calories and what does he gain from it", "13:14", "but now that we're working together", "13:17", "now that we have collective action all", "13:18", "sorts of things open up we could we", "13:21", "could devise division of labor I'll say", "13:23", "hey man you do this and I'll do that", "13:24", "because Australopithecus they've got 70", "13:27", "more grams in a chimp they can't do", "13:28", "things like that they can't all throw", "13:30", "rocks at the same time that's not rocket", "13:31", "science but all the kinds of things that", "13:33", "came next probably were enabled by that", "13:36", "process of us coming together and", "13:38", "deciding to work together and cooperate", "13:39", "so if you look at chimpanzees they don't", "13:41", "cooperate very well for example one of", "13:45", "the activities where they sort of", "13:46", "cooperate is when they hunt monkeys and", "13:47", "so they'll all gather round and they'll", "13:50", "see some monkeys in the trees and they", "13:51", "come in from every angle it's not very", "13:53", "coordinated it's kind of a wild", "13:54", "free-for-all but what's interesting", "13:56", "about it is that when the Hunts over", "13:57", "let's say you just sat there the whole", "13:59", "time and watched and I'm working my ass", "14:01", "off chasing these monkeys I got one you", "14:04", "come up and bug me four and I don't I", "14:05", "don't really handle it you like keep", "14:07", "nudging me till I share but I'm just as", "14:08", "likely to share with you if you helped", "14:10", "as if you didn't I don't make any", "14:12", "distinction and you'll never establish", "14:14", "effective groups if you can't reward", "14:15", "those who participate compared to those", "14:17", "who don't even little kids four year old", "14:19", "kids when you give them games to play", "14:21", "and they earn stickers if you didn't", "14:23", "play you know when you come up and ask", "14:25", "you don't get it you played even if you", "14:27", "didn't do your job right but you tried", "14:28", "boom you can have a sticker so humans", "14:31", "immediately get that that you get", "14:32", "rewarded for your activities as part of", "14:34", "the group chimps don't seem to have that", "14:36", "that's fascinating because but because", "14:38", "chimps really do have a sense of", "14:40", "fairness though and that that's one of", "14:43", "the issues that happened with the", "14:45", "captive chimp that attacked the man who", "14:47", "brought the birthday cake do you know", "14:48", "that story I don't know that's the awful", "14:49", "story oh he's this couple they kept a", "14:52", "chimp as a pet for a long time and then", "14:55", "as it got older it got a little violent", "14:57", "and they had to bring it to a sanctuary", "14:58", "and they brought it to a sanctuary and", "15:00", "they would go to visit it in the chimp", "15:02", "would remember them and they went to", "15:03", "visit it and it was on his birthday so", "15:04", "they brought him a cake and the other", "15:06", "chimps in the sanctuary were furious", "15:08", "that they didn't get the cake as well", "15:11", "they didn't think it was fair or they", "15:12", "were angry so they figured out somebody", "15:15", "had left a gate open they got out and", "15:17", "tore this guy apart yeah because he", "15:19", "didn't give them a cake yeah so there's", "15:21", "a the most famous example that is", "15:23", "actually with capuchin monkeys which", "15:24", "aren't nearly as smart as chimps and", "15:26", "it's this amazing study by Sarah Brosnan", "15:28", "and Fran's de Waal and if you want to", "15:29", "see it in action too", "15:30", "has it on a TED talk it's really quite", "15:32", "something to see and what they do in", "15:34", "that study is they teach these capuchin", "15:36", "monkeys to they give them pebble and", "15:38", "they teach the Capucines to return the", "15:40", "pebble and they give it a cucumber slice", "15:41", "and so it's learned the game for a", "15:44", "cucumber slices so if you wanted to ask", "15:46", "does the monkey think that's a fair", "15:47", "reward the answer has to be yes right", "15:49", "because it's it's doing that for", "15:50", "cucumber so now you and I are both", "15:52", "monkeys we're in our cage I returned the", "15:54", "pebble I get a cucumber now you return", "15:56", "the pebble and they hand you a grape", "15:57", "Capucines much prefer grapes over of", "16:00", "cucumbers and so then you what happens", "16:02", "next", "16:02", "well I've been doing this behavior for", "16:04", "cucumbers but as soon as you get a grape", "16:06", "I'm like yeah I'm not playing anymore", "16:07", "and you watch this tape and the Capuchin", "16:09", "it they give you a grape they give me", "16:12", "the cucumber and the thing looks totally", "16:13", "pissed it's pounding on the ground it", "16:15", "throws the cucumber back it's amazing", "16:17", "yeah well and so the question is what", "16:20", "does that mean why do they care about", "16:21", "fairness in that way and and I think the", "16:24", "answer to that question is sexual", "16:25", "selection and so the key to sexual", "16:29", "selection is it doesn't matter what", "16:31", "everybody's getting so long as I'm", "16:33", "getting it bout as much as everybody", "16:34", "else but the second that you're starting", "16:36", "to get more than I have well then", "16:38", "whatever females in our group she's", "16:40", "gonna pick you before she picks me and", "16:42", "so everything is relative we may think", "16:44", "no why do you care so much about what", "16:45", "other people are doing why don't you", "16:47", "just be happy with what you got but", "16:48", "literally the day you find out that the", "16:51", "guy in the next studio over salaries", "16:53", "twice yours your salary sucks right", "16:55", "because and it makes sense because", "16:57", "literally she's gonna choose him now", "17:00", "before she chooses you comparisons the", "17:02", "thief of joy yeah that's exactly right", "17:04", "it's a it's a really unfortunate fact", "17:06", "because sometimes it matters a lot like", "17:08", "for example imagine I invent a drug and", "17:10", "I say here you take a dose and it'll", "17:12", "double your IQ instantly you're gonna", "17:14", "feel like a genius but unbeknownst to", "17:15", "you I give everybody two doses you walk", "17:17", "out of there you're gonna feel like a", "17:18", "dumbass because people saying stuff you", "17:20", "can't understand right so then it", "17:22", "wouldn't matter right but the killer", "17:24", "cases are things were where it's only", "17:25", "just a residue so for example there's", "17:27", "this amazing study where they showed", "17:29", "that people were making minimum just", "17:31", "above minimum wage are the ones who", "17:33", "don't want you to raise minimum wage", "17:34", "they're the most against it really yeah", "17:37", "now why would that be well right now", "17:39", "they've got a slight advantage over", "17:41", "people making minimum wage the day", "17:42", "minimum wage gets raised", "17:44", "now they're not any better off than", "17:46", "anybody else so even though they're the", "17:48", "most likely to benefit from it because", "17:49", "they may lose that job they haven't have", "17:51", "to take minimum wage they're actually", "17:53", "against it because it gives them a", "17:54", "slight advantage over you know the guy", "17:56", "next door this is based on one study", "17:58", "because I would think that the people", "17:59", "that would be most against it would be", "18:00", "the people that are hiring folks alright", "18:03", "fair enough", "18:03", "I it's only a it's only looking at", "18:06", "income so the the boss probably feels", "18:08", "even the more negative of all but if you", "18:09", "look at people's income and their and", "18:11", "their feelings about raising minimum", "18:12", "wage the people are making minimum wage", "18:14", "wanted to go up to people one notch", "18:16", "above do not and then as the higher you", "18:17", "go they do again really yeah Wow", "18:20", "up until you get to the point where", "18:22", "you're employing people right wells and", "18:23", "some employers want to raise it right I", "18:25", "mean yeah and some don't there's huge", "18:27", "argument about that now when it comes", "18:28", "back to the capuchin monkeys does the", "18:30", "same effect happen whether it's a female", "18:32", "or I don't know I mean so thing is and", "18:35", "people argue like crazy about exactly", "18:37", "what this means I don't think the", "18:38", "monkeys have a sense of fairness like", "18:40", "you and I have but I do think they have", "18:42", "a sense of hold on you're getting more", "18:44", "than I am I can't write this happen", "18:46", "otherwise I'm screwed and there's lots", "18:48", "of great evidence that if you let that", "18:49", "happen you're screwed but do the females", "18:51", "have that same sense of competitiveness", "18:53", "that they need to have the exact same", "18:55", "thing those other bitches or haven't", "18:56", "they get angry well here's the thing it", "19:00", "depends on whether your mating system is", "19:02", "gonna be pair bonding or not so if", "19:05", "you're a frog or a lots of different", "19:08", "frogs not all of them a laughing tree", "19:09", "frog or if you're a elephant seal or", "19:12", "something well all the females mate with", "19:14", "the best male because his job is just", "19:15", "sex", "19:16", "and so every female can have the best", "19:18", "one or the eat either in the situation", "19:20", "where they got no choice like the", "19:21", "elephant seals he controls the Rookery", "19:23", "or in a situation where they just listen", "19:25", "to all the croaking and then they got", "19:26", "you're the best croaker you're the dad", "19:28", "mmm but if your pair bonding like humans", "19:31", "or like lots of other animals birds etc", "19:34", "the then what you need is you've got", "19:36", "competition on both sides so she's", "19:39", "always competing to get the best male", "19:40", "and he's always competing to get the", "19:42", "best female now there's reasons why", "19:44", "male-male competition is always a bit", "19:46", "more intense than female female", "19:48", "competition but both of them are there", "19:49", "and the more monogamous the system gets", "19:51", "the more both sides compete for each", "19:53", "other hmm interesting", "19:56", "so what about in the case of like", "19:58", "bonobos where they're so polyamorous", "20:01", "bonobos are super interesting system so", "20:03", "you've got lots of polyamorous animals", "20:05", "bonobos our interests are also you know", "20:08", "so if you look at them one of the great", "20:10", "ways to look at our ancestors and what", "20:12", "their lives were like is you look in", "20:13", "your trousers and the size your", "20:15", "testicles tells you a lot about what", "20:17", "sort of mating system your ancestors had", "20:19", "so gorillas have tiny little testicles", "20:22", "and the reason that they have such tiny", "20:23", "testicles is they use their huge body to", "20:25", "drive away the other males and then all", "20:27", "the females are in his harem so he", "20:30", "doesn't need big testicles because he", "20:31", "only needs enough sperm in order to", "20:33", "inseminate the females he's got it", "20:34", "doesn't take much sperm to inseminate", "20:36", "any one female and testicles are really", "20:38", "expensive tissue to make and if you own", "20:40", "a pair and you land on and you know", "20:42", "they're uncomfortable - right and so", "20:44", "then you look at our testicles and", "20:46", "they're quite a bit bigger than a", "20:47", "gorillas but they're nowhere near the", "20:48", "size of a chimp or bonobo both you know", "20:51", "they're basically in many ways almost", "20:53", "the same beasts and so although socially", "20:55", "quite different and they have a system", "20:58", "where they basically have to wash out", "20:59", "the guy who was there before him and so", "21:01", "it takes really big testicles to have", "21:03", "sperm competition so their competition", "21:05", "is embodying each other although there's", "21:06", "a degree of that - they know full well", "21:08", "that when she comes into estrus in the", "21:10", "heat there's gonna be a line and if", "21:12", "you're fifth in line and you can watch", "21:13", "everybody out before you you mind at the", "21:15", "dead wash everybody there's a funny way", "21:17", "of putting it so it's this this testicle", "21:22", "size is directly proportionate to the", "21:24", "number of promiscuous females well", "21:26", "that's right the promiscuity of the", "21:28", "mating system yeah and so if you look at", "21:30", "our mating system we clearly evolved to", "21:32", "be largely monogamous but not entirely", "21:34", "our testicles are unnecessarily large", "21:36", "for an entirely monogamous species and", "21:38", "so we're a little bit on the wash the", "21:40", "guy out ahead of us", "21:42", "there's many people to make arguments", "21:44", "that are monogamy is socially reinforced", "21:47", "and it's not natural look if you look at", "21:50", "how to gatherers and and so the best the", "21:52", "best way that we get a sense of well", "21:53", "what what did we evolved to do is to", "21:55", "look at the remaining hunter-gatherer", "21:56", "societies particularly if you look at", "21:58", "what are called immediate return on to", "22:00", "gathers so there are people who eat", "22:02", "today what they killed today then you", "22:03", "get a lot of hunt - gathers once they", "22:05", "left the equator they could store food", "22:07", "and everything change for them and they", "22:09", "actually and", "22:10", "the babes they look a lot like us and we", "22:12", "can come back to it if you'd like but if", "22:13", "you look at hunter-gatherers around the", "22:15", "equator they're typically immediate", "22:16", "return kill eat and so those guys tend", "22:21", "to be tend to be there's always of", "22:23", "course human differences where a super", "22:24", "variable species but they tend to be", "22:26", "serially monogamous and so some people", "22:28", "pair up for life", "22:30", "lots of people pair up for five seven", "22:32", "years and then break apart and pair up", "22:34", "again and so you have a sequence of", "22:36", "children with the secrets of people", "22:37", "right but but largely monogamous not", "22:40", "entirely and the fact monogamous during", "22:42", "those time periods yeah largely now we", "22:43", "know every single animal we've ever", "22:45", "described as monogamous when we do the", "22:47", "DNA we now find they're not entirely mmm", "22:50", "but they're mostly mmm interesting so", "22:52", "have you ever read sex at dawn mmm-hmm", "22:55", "what did you think of that um no offense", "22:57", "but I think it's total crap Chris Ryan", "23:00", "do you hear that shit everybody's", "23:01", "rocking on your book bro", "23:03", "what did you think is crap about it I", "23:05", "just don't think the system works that", "23:07", "way that explain to people that may not", "23:09", "know what word I haven't read that book", "23:11", "now since it came out so let me remind", "23:12", "remind me of the thesis do you remember", "23:14", "the idea is that we evolved in these", "23:16", "small tribes of people that essentially", "23:19", "shared sexual partners oh yeah that's", "23:22", "bullshit and so the thing is that what", "23:24", "makes you say that so confidently well I", "23:26", "don't know I shouldn't say it quite so", "23:27", "confidently you're absolutely right I", "23:29", "believe that's bullshit how's that okay", "23:31", "why do you believe that's bullshit", "23:32", "because so human beings have very clear", "23:36", "evolved jealousy systems and they're not", "23:39", "just a product of the world that we live", "23:41", "in today you can see jealousy among", "23:43", "hunter-gatherers as well now the thing", "23:45", "is they get jealous about different", "23:46", "things because of course men and women a", "23:48", "slightly different pressure on them but", "23:49", "they both get jealous by infidelity now", "23:51", "that's not to say that the book is", "23:53", "incorrect about some societies in some", "23:55", "places because one of the interesting", "23:57", "things about humans is our flexibility", "23:58", "and so you can create a system and", "24:01", "someone togethers have where there's a", "24:03", "lot of that none of that there's some", "24:05", "really interesting ones where literally", "24:07", "once the woman gets pregnant she then", "24:09", "starts to sleep with all the other males", "24:10", "because she thinks her baby will gain", "24:11", "the qualities of all the men that she", "24:13", "sleeps with so I'm not trying to claim", "24:15", "that we're always monogamous because", "24:17", "absolutely that's untrue but I do think", "24:19", "that the dominant system is one of", "24:21", "serial monogamy and I would", "24:23", "and I think that that's the dominant", "24:24", "system is this is kind of the deal that", "24:26", "we made whereby the males go out and do", "24:29", "the hunting the females go out and do", "24:31", "gathering and that's basically universal", "24:33", "she tends to cook for him and that comes", "24:35", "back to the fire point you made which we", "24:36", "can come back to and and so they share", "24:39", "resources and and he's happy to share", "24:41", "resources and do his best to kind of", "24:43", "sort of look out for her kids I mean", "24:45", "human males aren't we don't take as much", "24:47", "care as human females do of our kids but", "24:49", "we're much better than the other great", "24:50", "apes and so that level of investment", "24:53", "he's gonna make is tends to be to the", "24:55", "degree that he believes that he's the", "24:56", "father of the kids now you have", "24:58", "societies where he doesn't know that", "25:00", "really all are polyamorous like that by", "25:02", "all means I don't know how what", "25:03", "percentage they are and it could even be", "25:05", "their more common than I believe but", "25:07", "when that happens the systems tend to", "25:10", "change a little bit and he's a little", "25:11", "bit less willing to look out try to help", "25:13", "out kids other than to do her a favor", "25:16", "unless the kid looks a lot like himself", "25:18", "now what about why having a system a", "25:22", "biological system where jealousy comes", "25:26", "up what makes you think that that", "25:28", "somehow or another negates the idea of", "25:31", "polyamorous relationships well it does", "25:34", "suggest that they're not our default", "25:36", "because it doesn't it more likely", "25:38", "suggests that it encourages competition", "25:39", "which is just natural", "25:41", "well now you think about Envy instead of", "25:43", "jealousy and so if I'm jealous I'm upset", "25:46", "that my wife slept with somebody else", "25:48", "last night he could be a lowlife I don't", "25:50", "envy a thing about him I don't want", "25:52", "anything he owns but I'm jealous of her", "25:54", "behavior I'm protective of what she's", "25:57", "done and so there's a wonderful", "25:58", "experiment David buss has run at the", "26:00", "University of Texas jealous of the man", "26:03", "as well you're not just jealous of her", "26:05", "behavior you're you're jealous of this", "26:07", "other male that gets to have sex with", "26:09", "your wife and could not possibly", "26:11", "encourage competition and encourage men", "26:14", "to be more aggressive or more ingenious", "26:17", "or just create encourage creativity", "26:20", "encourage better hunting skills so you", "26:25", "attract more women I mean all those", "26:26", "things see all these I would have more", "26:28", "oh yeah I would agree with all that but", "26:29", "I phrased it a little bit differently so", "26:30", "there's this wonderful study out of the", "26:32", "Philippines where they measured minced", "26:34", "huge number of men's to", "26:36", "when they were single and then they", "26:38", "waited a few years and measured it again", "26:40", "after they were they were still single", "26:41", "we're now they're married or now they're", "26:42", "married and they have kids okay and I'm", "26:45", "sure it wasn't a psychology study", "26:46", "because we can't afford to do that it", "26:48", "was probably some medical thing but they", "26:50", "used at answer this interesting", "26:51", "psychological question which what's HAP", "26:53", "who's most likely to get the girl by", "26:55", "their original testosterone levels and", "26:56", "what happens when you do well the guys", "26:59", "who got married in the intervening few", "27:02", "years had higher testosterone than the", "27:03", "guys who didn't so yeah you're", "27:05", "absolutely right we're out there", "27:06", "competing with other males in order to", "27:08", "get the girl and and there's lots and", "27:10", "lots that goes on there tons of really", "27:11", "interesting things but what's", "27:13", "interesting is once we get the girl our", "27:14", "testosterone drops and so if we once we", "27:18", "partner up and if we're in a monogamous", "27:20", "relationship not polyamorous but in a", "27:22", "monogamous relationship our testosterone", "27:24", "drops and then it drops again if we have", "27:26", "kids and testosterone is a great hormone", "27:29", "for getting out there and being", "27:30", "competitive with other guys it's not a", "27:32", "great hormone for being nurturing for", "27:33", "your children and it's not a great", "27:35", "hormone for being faithful to your", "27:36", "partner and so I think that we evolved", "27:38", "to compete with other males in order to", "27:40", "get into the mating game so if you look", "27:43", "at our ancestral DNA you know how you", "27:45", "can track our male and female ancestry", "27:47", "through mitochondrial DNA on the", "27:48", "mother's side and why you'll see that we", "27:50", "have far more female ancestors than male", "27:52", "not quite 2 to 1 but I think it's close", "27:54", "to that and so what does that tell us", "27:56", "well lots of guys are getting left out", "27:58", "of the mating game entirely and lots of", "28:00", "guys are inseminating lots of different", "28:01", "women so all those things that you said", "28:03", "are absolutely true and all that pushes", "28:05", "us for competition but part of what I", "28:08", "believe goes on as part of that", "28:09", "competition that we engaged in was in", "28:11", "order to get the girl to get into that", "28:12", "relationship in the first place could I", "28:14", "start be there because I think that if", "28:16", "you're gonna have a study on", "28:18", "testosterone and you you have to have a", "28:21", "study on lifestyle I mean it you if you", "28:24", "get married and you have children one of", "28:26", "the things that happens is you become", "28:27", "less active you don't exercise as much", "28:30", "you don't sleep as much all those things", "28:32", "have a pretty radical effect on hormone", "28:34", "production absolutely and it could well", "28:36", "be that you know you always have to have", "28:37", "a proximal mechanism whereby evolution", "28:39", "plays its game right so the distal cause", "28:42", "is as an evolved species testosterone", "28:46", "super important to get us into the", "28:47", "mating game but it's less you", "28:49", "once we're in it well all you what you", "28:51", "could all you have to do is have a", "28:52", "system whereby those things tend to", "28:54", "down-regulate testosterone exactly like", "28:56", "you said because you know those things", "28:57", "are gonna happen once you get partnered", "28:58", "up and so but mine's your when our", "29:00", "ancestors partnered up they're still out", "29:02", "hunting every day you know we may be", "29:04", "threatened I don't have Studies on we", "29:05", "don't unfortunately we know is that I'm", "29:08", "having with this is we have Studies on", "29:10", "the the general health and testosterone", "29:13", "and hormonal health

sense to me because one thing", "29:23", "that everybody knows is that you get dad", "29:25", "bod right that's dad Bob what does dad", "29:28", "bought dad buys a guy who works all day", "29:30",

these guys I have a friend of", "31:43", "mine who he was was it how do you say", "31:47", "the name the Yanomami and I'm Olivia", "31:50", "Olivia well they're in Venezuela Brazil", "31:52", "yeah

wish I'd", "33:33", "read it more recently and so I could go", "33:35", "through the details with you there's", "33:36", "some really good reviews by", "33:38", "anthropologists and by people who work", "33:39", "and you know sexual studies and stuff", "33:42", "like that going through the details we", "33:44", "read it as a we haven't this", "33:45", "evolutionary center Center for a",

"34:16", "argument other people might say well", "34:18", "look there's a lot of cultures that that", "34:20", "do have much more like the system I told", "34:21", "you about where they have sex with

if if you ask", "35:28", "people this question what would bother", "35:29", "you more imagine your wife having sex", "35:32", "with somebody that she just met for the", "35:34", "first time having this great time and", "35:36", "doing all these different funky things", "35:37", "with them and then never doing it again", "35:39", "or your wife develops this you know", "35:42", "ongoing emotional

what would bother you", "35:51", "more and you ask men and women that", "35:52", "question hmm so what would in your case", "35:54", "what would bother you more to have your", "35:55", "wife to know she had this one-off affair", "35:57", "fling sex only didn't care about the guy", "36:00", "or she develops a sort of emotional bond", "36:02", "with somebody never touches him that's a", "36:06", "good question", "36:06", "I'd really have to think about that it's", "36:08", "not anything cos nobody likes either no", "36:11", "yeah because it's a matter of time", "36:14", "before that dude gets in that's a no-no", "36:17", "in this case it's a guarantee right it's", "36:19", "a guarantee that they never never", "36:21", "touched never took long as he doesn't", "36:22", "talk shit about me that's your way I", "36:28", "would do so much better", "36:30", "well here's the thing weasels on average", "36:33", "men are more bothered by sex the one off", "36:36", "sex and women are more bothered by the", "36:38", "emotional emotional connection because", "36:40", "that's a big attraction could lead to", "36:42", "him leaving her well also if it's him", "36:45", "leaving her in

heavily overlapping bell", "36:54", "curves right so it's never 100% this way", "36:56", "and except like do you have this organ", "36:58", "or something right but if you", "36:59", "psychologically it's always overlapping", "37:01", "but on this is a big effect men on", "37:03", "average are much more bothered by the", "37:04", "one-off sex and women on average are", "37:07", "much more bothered by the emotional", "37:09", "connection yeah that's fascinating", "37:11", "because I was reading something about", "37:12", "inappropriate emotional relationships", "37:15", "that people have at work and that this", "37:17", "is an issue with people that work", "37:20", "together they develop these you know", "37:22", "office friendships that lead to", "37:25", "inappropriate emotional relationships", "37:28", "and I was like wow this is a", "37:30", "you know I've never worked in an office", "37:32", "so I'm listening to this reading this", "37:34", "rather and I'm like what a strange world", "37:36", "that is like I get it though I get it", "37:40", "like if there's a guy and he's married", "37:42", "in a gal and she's married but they meet", "37:43", "at work and they staring each other's", "37:45", "eyes all day and they go to lunch and", "37:47", "maybe they even hold hands every now on", "37:49", "that well they become yeah that's so", "37:51", "that's where it crosses the line like", "37:53", "you're a lot of hug people when you hold", "37:54", "hands that's fuckin that's intense", "37:56", "that's skin-to-skin it is serious it's", "38:00", "it's gonna concern you if you're a", "38:02", "partner yeah but what's also gonna", "38:04", "concern you as a mere fact that you see", "38:05", "this kind of thing this deep", "38:06", "conversation happening and all that", "38:08", "because think about it if we evolved to", "38:10", "basically partner up for a while then", "38:13", "there's always gonna be the chance of", "38:14", "that next person long it's gonna be the", "38:16", "one Oh wedges years away serial monogamy", "38:18", "and both males and females gain from not", "38:20", "putting all their eggs into the same", "38:22", "genetic basket so if my part if my wife", "38:25", "partners up with you for a while she'll", "38:26", "get a certain kind of offspring and then", "38:28", "maybe that'll be a great thing but maybe", "38:29", "when the situation changes or the you", "38:32", "know in in tomorrow's world some smaller", "38:34", "or wimpier guy would be handy in some", "38:36", "way and so maybe she's better off", "38:38", "partnering with me next interesting yeah", "38:40", "it is fascinating when you break it down", "38:42", "that it really does become there's a", "38:45", "biological reason for these behaviors", "38:49", "and these the the motivation for the", "38:52", "jealousy and all these things that", "38:54", "there's right there's no history a", "38:55", "biological history to all this stuff and", "38:57", "and we don't know what I'm together is", "38:59", "how they would answer that question so", "39:01", "we can or only just assuming that the", "39:03", "answer we're providing is general but", "39:05", "for me those kinds of things suggest", "39:07", "that we involve we evolved in a lot of", "39:09", "long-term monogamous circumstances that", "39:12", "may have been serial and that was", "39:13", "certainly fooling around but if we were", "39:15", "polyamorous like the book says we'd have", "39:17", "bigger balls balls are so big though", "39:20", "compared to a chimp they're small", "39:22", "yeah but chimps are mean everything's", "39:25", "big with them well no our peoples have", "39:27", "way bigger than theirs right they got a", "39:28", "tiny little live large Paul's smaller", "39:31", "penises but pants are probably get in", "39:33", "the way right well no here's the thing", "39:34", "about so human beings copulate for an", "39:37", "extraordinarily long period of time and", "39:39", "and we also have this cryptic ovulation", "39:41", "you know where she's not showing you", "39:42", "that she's an E", "39:43", "so MailChimp's aren't interested unless", "39:46", "she has an enormous swelling on her", "39:48", "vagina and then they're like oh that's", "39:50", "super attractive to me oh I say so but", "39:52", "what about bonobos because they well", "39:53", "they do this funky sex thing all the", "39:55", "time right they'll have fun right yeah", "39:57", "they're all sorts of funky orgiastic", "39:59", "kinds of things we used there's a when I", "40:02", "taught at Ohio State University of the", "40:04", "zoo there has a great bonobos exhibit", "40:06", "and you bring your kids too and there's", "40:07", "a serious orgy going on and the kids are", "40:09", "like hey mom she's up Julie you know", "40:11", "yeah there's a lot of zoos that won't", "40:12", "happen ovals because they're right and", "40:14", "they're pretty interesting and so the", "40:16", "thing is that those kinds of things just", "40:18", "show you that it's complicated right any", "40:20", "kind of straightforward answer it's", "40:23", "gonna have some solutes yeah yes yeah", "40:25", "and I apologize if I get some earlier no", "40:27", "no and so anyway the but back to this", "40:31", "issue so if we had a total bonobo chimp", "40:34", "kind of system I don't think we'd", "40:36", "evolved those systems of jealousy", "40:38", "because what's what's to be gained by", "40:39", "that we're not making these long-term", "40:40", "partners why would you get these", "40:41", "differences again whenever I bring", "40:43", "Chris's book up but and I have to defend", "40:45", "it because have it a couple times in the", "40:46", "last year I haven't read it in at least", "40:49", "two years I'd have to go back and I read", "40:52", "it back over probably five years ago", "40:53", "when it came out when my friend's wife", "40:56", "got ahold of it my friend got it and my", "40:59", "friend's wife got all of it and she'd", "41:01", "throw right in a trash she read like a", "41:03", "paragraph or two and she's like fuck", "41:05", "this book yeah a lot of women react that", "41:08", "way whatever so when these chimp like", "41:16", "creatures from millions of years ago", "41:18", "slowly started walking upright and", "41:21", "started moving into the grasslands and", "41:26", "making making experiments and traveling", "41:29", "away from the jungle and this coincided", "41:33", "with the development of the throwing arm", "41:35", "and this could because they started", "41:37", "walking upright when did this", "41:40", "when did the cooked meat aspect okay", "41:42", "come along so they don't control fire so", "41:45", "also pigeons can't do that so now we go", "41:46", "forward we're now about three and a half", "41:48", "million years ago", "41:49", "you got to now go forward to about a", "41:51", "little less than two million years ago", "41:53", "to get to Homo erectus so once we get to", "41:55", "homo erectus we", "41:56", "now God and an ancestor that literally", "41:59", "if it went to the seed say well that's a", "42:01", "kind of rough hewn guy but you think", "42:03", "it's a person and not somebody who", "42:04", "belongs behind less so so a chimp brain", "42:07", "is 380", "42:09", "Australopithecus 450 and Homo erectus", "42:11", "960 whoa so you got doubling our brains", "42:14", "has no mind you it's a bigger being so", "42:16", "you're it's not as quite as big a", "42:17", "dramatic of a change as you think", "42:19", "but along with that comes all sorts of", "42:20", "capabilities now you write about this", "42:23", "book Catching Fire Richard Wrangham", "42:24", "argued that what enabled that so if you", "42:27", "look at the gut of a gorilla or a", "42:29", "chimpanzee in their brain they got a lot", "42:30", "of gut for a little bit of brain because", "42:32", "it takes a lot of digestion to keep a", "42:34", "little bit of brain going we have a tiny", "42:36", "gut for a huge brain and Wrangham argues", "42:38", "and I think quite rightly that the only", "42:40", "way you can achieve that is by releasing", "42:42", "more nutrients from your food and the", "42:44", "only way you can release more nutrients", "42:45", "from your food is by cooking it so when", "42:47", "he made that argument he thinks it goes", "42:48", "back to the beginning of Homo erectus", "42:50", "and I suspect he's right at this point", "42:52", "when he made the argument it was only", "42:54", "back to I remember half a million years", "42:56", "three and seven fifty thousand it's", "42:58", "already back to a million years ago we", "43:00", "found in caves in South Africa evidence", "43:02", "of controlled fire and so it'll probably", "43:04", "keep getting pushed back because you", "43:06", "know that craps hard to find right so", "43:08", "this was you say a half a million years", "43:09", "so now it's back to a million a million", "43:11", "years and he made that prediction when", "43:12", "it wasn't even that far back and a", "43:14", "million years ago even though they're", "43:16", "not technically it's not homo sapien no", "43:18", "we're still at Homo erectus and so they", "43:20", "started a 1.9 or so 1.7 million years", "43:23", "ago and 1.9 I think and what Homo", "43:26", "erectus could now do so now remember", "43:29", "what the argument is is this social leap", "43:31", "it's this collective action that not", "43:33", "only protects us on the savanna but sets", "43:36", "us on this new pathway it creates this", "43:38", "new niche it's this cognitive niche", "43:40", "although I think of it as a social", "43:41", "cognitive nish because it's the working", "43:43", "together that gives you all these", "43:44", "potential advantages to getting smarter", "43:46", "and so now that when that gene sitting", "43:48", "in our head if it kicks into gear those", "43:50", "and starts to work and and it quit leads", "43:53", "to cranial expansion those animals who", "43:55", "have it will have an advantage because", "43:56", "they can coordinate with each other", "43:57", "better and so they can remember hey man", "43:59", "you helped me out last time but you", "44:01", "weren't so you couldn't count on you so", "44:03", "I'm avoiding you and I'm sticking with", "44:04", "you they could do a lot of things with", "44:06", "that brain power and by the time you get", "44:08", "to homo erectus and the brain powers", "44:09", "double we see also", "44:10", "it's a super interesting things so", "44:12", "before Homo erectus when you look at our", "44:15", "tools that it's called an old wand tool", "44:16", "and it's basically a barely sharpened", "44:18", "rock and you never find an older wand", "44:20", "tool to very far away from where ever it", "44:23", "was quarried and made like you know you", "44:25", "look at the rock and the chips and not", "44:27", "far away is where it's lying on the", "44:28", "ground Homo erectus made a much nicer", "44:30", "tool it's by facial it took a lot of", "44:33", "energy to make it when we teach modern", "44:36", "anthropologists or grad students or", "44:38", "whatever to make them and you put them", "44:40", "in an fMRI magnet where it can measure", "44:42",

"44:50", "hit it next to make this thing just", "44:51", "right compared to an old Awan tool to", "44:53", "make those doesn't take much frontal", "44:55", "functional I just whack it there and", "44:56", "it'll be sharp and so the so first of", "44:59", "all we know Homo erectus invented that", "45:00", "tool this is the seshu lien tool with", "45:03", "his by facial hand axe second of all

"45:37", "got division of labour you're the big", "45:39", "strong guy you do the first thing then", "45:41", "you hand it to me and I do the finer", "45:42", "sharpening it makes sense that it

it was Spears it would be", "46:06", "in a wooden point so I think what they", "46:08", "could tap ding meaning the end of it", "46:10", "like Hutton half spear tip yeah exactly", "46:13", "and then exactly strata on earth or any", "46:15", "of a variety of way I put yeah and so", "46:17", "they there's no sign of that yet but", "46:20", "there's no reason why they couldn't have", "46:21", "a

it's really", "46:36", "recently there was an article I read one", "46:37", "or two days ago at about orangutans so", "46:39", "when they gave them wire they used the", "46:41", "wire to fashion it

bit", "48:26", "there what does that photo it's just", "48:28", "I'll just him with a stick yeah yeah oh", "48:30", "yeah that's really really cool I had", "48:33", "read something a few years back that", "48:35", "said", "48:36", "that they were agreeing that chimpanzees", "48:39", "had officially moved into the Stone Age", "48:41", "yeah so chimpanzees will use stones as", "48:44", "tools so they'll crack nuts with them", "48:46", "but they've never they've never been", "48:49", "shown to modify stone bars and so if you", "48:52", "want to say the Stone Age usin stones by", "48:53", "all means if you want to say it's", "48:54", "modifying stones the the oldest evidence", "48:57", "that we have of potentially modified is", "48:59", "three point three million years ago", "49:00", "these Lamech we tools but there's", "49:02", "argument about how legit those up right", "49:04", "there's argument about a lot of those", "49:06", "sites to where they believe that they", "49:07", "find stone tools that are ancient", "49:09", "because it could easily just been shale", "49:11", "or yeah and overwash it's super", "49:13", "complicated to know exactly when it got", "49:15", "laid down every once we'll get lucky and", "49:16", "and the layers are super orderly and", "49:18", "then when you give to that layer you", "49:20", "know exactly what you got but now what's", "49:21", "the chances of finding what you're after", "49:23", "there right yeah now when they say the", "49:26", "Stone Age that's what they mean just the", "49:28", "idea of consciously using a rock to like", "49:30", "smash open a clam or something like that", "49:32", "yeah I mean to me that does I got a I", "49:34", "gotta admit I'm not quite sure", "49:35", "technically what an anthropologist would", "49:37", "mean when they say Stone Age but to what", "49:40", "what we know is that chimps will do that", "49:42", "they'll use rocks to they'll even have", "49:43", "it's they're clever enough to have an", "49:45", "anvil basically like a hammer a base", "49:47", "stone put a rock on it smash yeah what", "49:49", "they're not clever enough to do so", "49:51", "chimps have partial theory of mind and", "49:53", "theory of mind is this idea that I know", "49:55", "that the contents of your mind differ", "49:57", "from the contents of mine and all humans", "50:00", "get there when they're little around age", "50:01", "four and so the and you can see the", "50:04", "penny drop because they just assume", "50:05", "everybody knows the same things and", "50:07", "everybody's the same preferences and and", "50:09", "that's why when they're really little", "50:10", "their stories can be hard to follow", "50:11", "because they assume what's in your head", "50:13", "is the same as theirs they assume you", "50:15", "like the same things and actually it", "50:17", "turns out that the ones who have", "50:18", "siblings learn it earlier because it's", "50:20", "like oh you like the red jelly beans I", "50:21", "like the green ones awesome this is a", "50:23", "beneficial deal for both of us right", "50:25", "right", "50:26", "anyway chimps can get partial theory of", "50:28", "mind so I could see what you could say I", "50:30", "know what you could see it your angle if", "50:32", "I'm a chimp and I know that it might", "50:33", "differ from what I could see right but", "50:35", "they can't get to the point of knowing", "50:37", "that you could represent beliefs that", "50:39", "aren't true that you could have to", "50:40", "believe etcetera or that maybe I don't", "50:42", "like bananas but he does like but they", "50:44", "can't really get that no and so what the", "50:46", "problem is without theory of mind how do", "50:48", "teach somebody because if I just assume", "50:50", "you know what I know then when you're", "50:52", "doing a crappy job breaking the nut I'm", "50:54", "like what's wrong with Joe here Brian", "50:55", "and so chimp mothers take years to teach", "50:59", "their offspring to break these nuts open", "51:01", "ten years on average because first of", "51:04", "all they don't get a chance to do it", "51:04", "very often then that's got to be in", "51:06", "season second well it's easy to break", "51:08", "your fingers and that kind of slows you", "51:09", "down a third of all they'll occasionally", "51:12", "make some very specific Corrections when", "51:14", "they when the offspring is doing it", "51:15", "wrong but they don't know what the", "51:17", "problem is because they don't know what", "51:18", "the kid doesn't know and so when you", "51:20", "don't know that you can't teach and", "51:22", "that's why humans are stunningly", "51:24", "effective teachers that's fascinating", "51:27", "so chimps learn more just by observing", "51:30", "yeah and what's amazing about the way", "51:32", "chimps observe is that because we have", "51:34", "theory of mind we also do imitate", "51:36", "differently so this amazing experiment", "51:38", "by Andy White and his colleagues and", "51:39", "what they did is they created this", "51:41", "treasure box and so inside this treasure", "51:43", "box there's something that a chimp or a", "51:45", "kid wants like a little piece of food", "51:46", "and in the in one condition the box is", "51:49", "totally opaque so you can't see how it", "51:51", "works and they'll poke at the top of it", "51:53", "and then the poke in the middle and it", "51:54", "pops open and then they give it to the", "51:56", "chimp close it up chimp does the exact", "51:58", "same thing poke poke poke poke pops open", "52:00", "give it to a kid does the exact same", "52:02", "thing", "52:02", "now they do that they do the replicate", "52:05", "that same experiment but instead of", "52:06", "having that that box be opaque it's", "52:08", "translucent and you can see well and", "52:10", "truly that poking the top does nothing", "52:11", "the latch is actually right here and so", "52:14", "that initial poke was a waste of your", "52:15", "time this second one actually is one", "52:18", "that opened the box up when when chimps", "52:20", "watch that they skip the first one and", "52:22", "they just open the box", "52:23", "kids despite being smarter than a chimp", "52:26", "poking at the top first and then they", "52:28", "poke it in the bottom and we call this", "52:30", "over imitation they're imitating clearly", "52:33", "irrelevant actions now why would anybody", "52:36", "imitate clearly irrelevant actions what", "52:38", "advantage would it give you well if your", "52:39", "theory of mind you say well that's Joe's", "52:42", "box he knows something about it there", "52:44", "may be a reason why I can't see but", "52:46", "there may be reason why he's poking at", "52:47", "the top first and so I better do", "52:49", "everything that he does I better have", "52:51", "the highest fidelity copying that I", "52:53", "possibly can because it may be valuable", "52:55", "and what you end up with is these", "52:57", "systems around the world where people", "52:58", "eat these amazing foods that you think", "53:01", "you know how on earth", "53:02", "they've ever figured that out well this", "53:03", "probably developed step by step and", "53:05", "everybody's always got the super high", "53:07", "fidelity imitation because they're over", "53:09", "imitating so my favorite example is in", "53:11", "New Guinea they'd the sago palm I'm not", "53:13", "sure if you ever seen a sago palm but it", "53:15", "does not look like an edible tree it", "53:16", "just looks like a freaking tree right", "53:18", "mmm and it turns out that if you you", "53:20", "chop the tree down take the bark off", "53:22", "take like in ads or something similar", "53:24", "grind up the sawdust have all that", "53:26", "sawdust you then wash it off in warm", "53:28", "water because of course all the water in", "53:30", "New Guinea will be nice and warm and", "53:31", "that causes it's a super high starch", "53:33", "tree that causes the starch molecules to", "53:35", "separate from the sawdust because at", "53:36", "that point it's inedible so then they", "53:38", "have these cloths and the starch", "53:40", "molecules have passed through the cloth", "53:41", "the sawdust one now they collect this", "53:43", "cloudy water they put in these", "53:44", "traditional canoes they let it sit", "53:46", "overnight and all the starch sinks to", "53:48", "the bottom then they pour the water off", "53:49", "the top and now they've got this flower", "53:51", "but you have to dry it out in the Sun", "53:52", "really faster it becomes toxic so it's", "53:55", "like this nine step process that who on", "53:56", "earth could ever come up with it right", "53:58", "but once it's in place once they slowly", "54:00", "figured it out to make it work everybody", "54:02", "just does it the same way because even", "54:04", "though they don't know that they may", "54:05", "understand it but they don't need to", "54:06", "they just know this is how we do it", "54:07", "right well that's like that", "54:10", "what is that route that they cassava", "54:12", "yeah yeah that if you don't cook it", "54:15", "correctly", "54:15", "it's literally cyanide yeah and they", "54:18", "have water from it and they have to take", "54:20", "that water and they have the buckets of", "54:22", "these water these you know water for", "54:24", "that they're using to create this stuff", "54:27", "and they just leave it laying around and", "54:29", "kids are playing around it no yeah", "54:31", "pigs and animals around it and if they", "54:34", "drank it they'd be dead yeah i don't", "54:35", "know that i don't know the detoxing of", "54:37", "cassava unfortunately not i'm not", "54:38", "familiar with it but there's a lot of", "54:40", "those examples and you're also right", "54:41", "that in those kind of societies they're", "54:43", "super relaxed about things that we", "54:45", "strike the stress is really what exactly", "54:48", "but that stuff it becomes cyanide right", "54:50", "you could be right i don't know that one", "54:52", "see if you could find this cuz it's on", "54:54", "an episode of that same show it's not", "54:56", "this show is called meat eater it's my", "54:58", "friend Steve Rinella who went and spent", "55:00", "some time with them down in the jungle", "55:02", "of South America it's really interesting", "55:05", "stuff just seeing how these people", "55:07", "function and and they have this big vat", "55:10", "and they're cooking this stuff and", "55:11", "they're you know he's explaining like", "55:14", "right now if you a", "55:15", "you're you're dead you gotta wait a", "55:17", "while and like how the fuck did they", "55:18", "figure this out", "55:19", "researchers to get the real Java cyanide", "55:22", "was cyanide producing abilities cassava", "55:25", "is the third most important food source", "55:27", "in tropical countries but it's one major", "55:28", "problem the roots and the leaves the", "55:30", "poorly processed cassava plants contain", "55:32", "a substance that when eaten can trigger", "55:34", "the production of cyanide yeah it kills", "55:36", "the shit out of you yeah but it's weird", "55:38", "like that that thing is like a major", "55:40", "step on their diet well this is a really", "55:42", "good example of a the value of human", "55:45", "learning and and this over mutation", "55:46", "process right because the first guy way", "55:48", "they go okay I'm not gonna do that right", "55:49", "and then this person ate and they did", "55:51", "successful let's take a look at what", "55:52", "they did yeah so I remember when I was a", "55:54", "kid I was trying to learn to play", "55:56", "baseball and pitch the ball and the", "55:58", "person raises their knee almost up to", "56:00", "their nipples and I'm like that's the", "56:02", "most awkward pitching motion I've ever", "56:03", "seen but I didn't occur to me I'm not", "56:05", "gonna do that right it occurred to me", "56:07", "well there must be a reason to do that", "56:08", "so what can I do to try to emulate that", "56:11", "motion right the whole nine yards", "56:15", "there's a purpose for every one of those", "56:16", "pieces right and as humans we say well", "56:18", "you're teaching me how you've got to", "56:20", "have a reason for doing that and that's", "56:22", "the huge difference between us and", "56:23", "everybody else nobody else can do that", "56:25",

big", "60:10", "difference and you're absolutely right", "60:11", "it's accelerating like crazy and I I'm", "60:14", "totally convinced well I believe ragams", "60:16", "right I mean we don't know for sure of", "60:18", "course but I believe he's right that it", "60:19", "was fire that played a huge role in that", "60:21", "and so what you got is this process", "60:23", "where our evolution facilitates our", "60:25", "further evolution right so you get the", "60:26", "cognitive capacities to control fire and", "60:28", "now that allows you to grow your brain", "60:30", "even larger because we can we can store", "60:32", "fat we can get more nutrients from the", "60:34", "food we eat we can detoxify other things", "60:36", "fire is super valuable even chimps will", "60:39", "eat if they go through our area where", "60:41", "there's a forest fire you know speaking", "60:42", "what's going on locally", "60:43", "they'll eat like the roasted nuts first", "60:46", "they really like that because I mean you", "60:48", "know just you go in your kitchen you", "60:49", "smell a raw steak it's like palatable", "60:52", "you smell it when it's cooking it's", "60:53", "delicious right that is interesting", "60:55", "right", "60:55", "that's us no salt or and yeah it's our", "60:57", "nose telling us that is a great source", "60:59", "of food and nutrients that's not so much", "61:02", "that is interesting I've never thought", "61:04", "about it that way but yeah there's a", "61:05", "tremendous difference in the way your", "61:07", "your body reacts to it and it's not just", "61:09", "based on your experience eating it it's", "61:12", "just smells amazing and so Wrangham", "61:15", "talks about he argues that you've you", "61:17", "can't live on a diet of raw food unless", "61:19", "you're eating these like super fruits", "61:21", "and stuff like that basically we've", "61:22", "horticulture it into existence because", "61:24", "raw food just doesn't give you enough", "61:26", "calories so the example that he uses", "61:29", "which is a great one", "61:30", "his chimps literally spend something", "61:31", "like six to eight hours a day chewing", "61:33", "just to soften up the food enough so", "61:36", "that they can swallow it and digest it", "61:37", "right we you know if sushi you're hardly", "61:39", "you know some of the things that we've", "61:41", "cooked and that's raw in that case but", "61:42", "you know cooked steak a really nice one", "61:44", "you barely chew it at all down the hatch", "61:46", "ago that's a great argument for gorillas", "61:48", "as well right because gorillas are just", "61:50", "eating roots yeah fucking celery and so", "61:52", "literally they have a humongous gut", "61:54", "right constant you", "61:55", "in order to me and they've got hewed the", "61:57", "sagittal crest right here with the bone", "61:58", "so that the muscles attach to it so they", "62:00", "can chew hard enough to get through all", "62:02", "that stuff and make a digestible and", "62:03", "still there God is enormous yeah that is", "62:05", "interesting the chimps have those", "62:06", "enormous chewing muscles on their head", "62:08", "and so we lost that's another example", "62:10", "where somebody along the way lost I", "62:12", "can't remember what that gene was where", "62:14", "our muscles weaken in our jaw and that", "62:16", "would have been a that would have been a", "62:17", "death knell if you're back before", "62:19", "cooking opposed cooking all that does is", "62:21", "free up space get rid of some", "62:22", "unnecessary muscle free up more screen", "62:24", "eyo space for brains the inside not the", "62:26", "outside so is it likely that there was a", "62:29", "bunch of different factors that there", "62:30", "was natural selection in play and that", "62:32", "there was also the the throwing arm and", "62:35", "then also cooking and also this this", "62:38", "cooperative effort that led to people", "62:41", "being a little bit more ingenious a", "62:43", "little bit smarter and how they hunted", "62:46", "and how they tried to get food and then", "62:48", "how they protected their fire how they", "62:50", "cultivated fire and then all these", "62:52", "things led to more clever behavior which", "62:55", "led to a natural selection of clever", "62:57", "more clever chimps with larger brains or", "63:00", "Apes rather with larger brains", "63:02", "absolutely and so anytime you got", "63:04", "something major happening it probably", "63:06", "doesn't have a single cause it probably", "63:07", "has lots and lots of causes and so in", "63:10", "this case all these kind of factors came", "63:12", "together now if you're standing at the", "63:13", "outset and you're playing God and saying", "63:15", "well let's see what happens when I dry", "63:16", "out the rainforests I think 9 times out", "63:18", "of 10 the chimps all end up dead", "63:20", "right right but somehow we got really", "63:22", "lucky and they went down this very", "63:23", "particular road and once they got their", "63:27", "social act together and they started", "63:28", "cooperating chimps are never gonna be", "63:30", "very effective in groups because they", "63:31", "can't get along they can't cooperate", "63:32", "very well but but once these animals", "63:35", "probably add Australopithecus but maybe", "63:37", "not so later of course we don't know all", "63:39", "we can look is what they were capable of", "63:40", "but it fits the storyline that they", "63:43", "would have been the ones who developed", "63:44", "that once that happened social becomes", "63:46", "everything so we tend to think about", "63:49", "what are the challenges of physical life", "63:51", "like you know that sago palm you move", "63:53", "into that territory and you got a", "63:54", "freaking figure that out it seems", "63:55", "enormously complicated but you have to",

random thing if it really did", "67:13", "play that role how random that is that", "67:15", "these freaking things happen to be", "67:16", "growing there and that they happen to be", "67:18",

"67:26", "have become alcoholic we know that", "67:28", "animals will do that you've seen Jaguars", "67:30", "that consume psychedelic plants and they", "67:32", "rely on their back and stare at the sky", "67:34", "oh it's amazing but you know what", "67:37", "ayahuasca is no ayahuasca is a it's a", "67:42", "way that these people in the rainforest", "67:47", "develop untold thousands of years ago of", "67:50", "developing an orally active version of", "67:53", "dimethyltryptamine do you know what", "67:54", "dimethyltryptamine no I'm not okay", "67:56", "dimethyltryptamine is the most

here's", "68:09", "a Jaguar it's really crazy and this is", "68:11", "in the Amazon these Jaguars eat these", "68:13", "plants and these plants are they have", "68:17", "the ingredients of ayahuasca and these", "68:20", "Jaguars are known to eat these things", "68:22", "and then trip their fucking balls off", "68:24", "they eat them and there are pupils", "68:26", "dilate and they roll over on their back", "68:28", "and stare at the sky I mean they're", "68:29", "clearly high right so this is something", "68:32", "oh you're gonna say yeah this is what", "68:33", "I'm gonna say so this is what what", "68:35", "ayahuasca is is dimethyltryptamine like", "68:38", "it's kind of cool watching this Jaguar", "68:40", "trip balls yeah they just stare they see", "68:44", "shit that's not their I mean or it is", "68:46", "their maybe they're still traveling it's", "68:48", "amazing", "68:48", "so what ayahuasca is is there's", "68:52", "dimethyltryptamine which is this", "68:54", "incredibly potent psychedelic drug is", "68:56", "produced in the human body it's produced", "68:58", "by the liver it's produced by the lungs", "69:00", "and they also believe it's produced by", "69:01", "the pineal gland which is literally your", "69:04", "third eye the pineal gland in certain", "69:07", "reptiles actually has a rep retina in a", "69:09", "lens I mean it's like an eyeball and", "69:11", "they think in the Egyptians called it", "69:14", "the seat of the soul and they think that", "69:15", "this is one of the reasons why they have", "69:18", "this obsession with this gland in", "69:21", "Eastern mysticism is somehow or another", "69:23", "they figured out that this is the gland", "69:25", "that produces this incredibly potent", "69:27", "psychedelic drug this psychedelic drug", "69:30", "dimethyltryptamine also exists in", "69:32", "thousands of different plants the", "69:33", "problem is when you consume in orally", "69:35", "your body produces something in your gut", "69:38", "called monoamine oxidase mono AMI and", "69:40", "oxidase breaks it down so what these", "69:42", "indigenous people figured out is how to", "69:45", "combine one plant which contains this", "69:48", "psychedelic compound with another plant", "69:50", "which contains a natural MAO inhibitor", "69:53", "called harmine so they brew this all", "69:55", "together much like they did with the", "69:56", "cassava but we wondered no idea how they", "69:58", "figured that out right they brew this", "69:59", "stuff up together and they create this", "70:01", "psychedelic tea called ayahuasca and", "70:03", "ayahuasca now they have all these trips", "70:06", "where people go down to Peru and take", "70:07", "this stuff and trip to fucking balls off", "70:09", "and this this the combination of these", "70:14", "things", "70:15", "leads to this incredibly potent Trench", "70:19", "really transformative experience which", "70:22", "is impossible to describe and that this", "70:25", "this psychedelic drug why did I bring", "70:27", "that up what was what we're talking", "70:29", "about how maybe jimpson are these early", "70:31", "ancestors did something similar which", "70:33", "pushed them along this path is starting", "70:35", "to completely I get to DM 2 what did I", "70:38", "get the ayahuasca a couple of links in", "70:41", "that JT is because of animals that get", "70:43", "high that's that's what it was so this", "70:45", "is", "70:45", "this that's exactly what it was it was", "70:47", "yeah the Jaguar getting high on DMT so", "70:50", "that's what they think that Jaguars", "70:51", "doing this is the Jaguar consuming this", "70:53", "stuff it's making him trip on DMT and", "70:55", "EMTs I mean it's fun it's really", "70:58", "exciting and so it's so Robert Rivers is", "71:01", "wonderful biologist who started a lot of", "71:03", "the kinds of work that we're talking", "71:04", "about going in the 70s calls these sorts", "71:07", "of things of phenotypic indulgence right", "71:09", "so evolution gave you these pleasure", "71:11", "centers in your brain so that you do", "71:13", "what's in your genes best interests and", "71:15", "kill the animal or get the girl or", "71:17", "whatever and that makes you feel good", "71:18", "and so we tend to like the things that", "71:20", "are good for us and dislike the things", "71:21", "that are bad for us we don't want to eat", "71:22", "feces we do on eat a steak so there's", "71:26", "cases like this where it's short", "71:27", "circuits that it goes right to the", "71:29", "pleasure center even though what it's", "71:30", "doing is kind of irrelevant but this is", "71:32", "a case where maybe it wasn't irrelevant", "71:34", "maybe it actually caused these animals", "71:35", "to then change the way that they behave", "71:37", "to become more sociable right it's very", "71:39", "possible something like that played a", "71:40", "role along the way which is why if you", "71:43", "replay the sequence of The Vanishing", "71:44", "rainforest ten times only one time does", "71:47", "it maybe lead to anything good and the", "71:49", "other nine times it leads to a bunch of", "71:50", "dead chimps mmm yeah well the the", "71:53", "process is probably incredibly slow", "71:55", "right over a millions of years of the", "71:57", "climate did alter what's right so you", "71:58", "got millions of years for the rainforest", "72:00", "to disappear so you got these animals to", "72:01", "slowly slowly say I got no choice", "72:03", "slowly figure it out and then I I think", "72:06", "for three-and-a-half million years", "72:07", "literally there was skulking around the", "72:08", "edges and and they figured nothing out", "72:10", "but there was a pressure on them to walk", "72:13", "upright and nobody knows for sure what", "72:15", "that pressure is one hypothesis that has", "72:17", "some possible there's probably a lot of", "72:18", "reasons right anytime something big", "72:20", "happens it's probably a lot of causes so", "72:22", "some people have said that you can cover", "72:23", "ground more efficiently when you walk", "72:25", "upright with fewer calories and", "72:26", "especially this idea of slowly running", "72:28", "down animals you may have heard about", "72:30", "this notions persistence hunting exactly", "72:32", "we talked about that yesterday huh", "72:34", "and so um but another reason is so ask", "72:39", "yourself so why would an animal so if we", "72:41", "back up a little bit remember I talked", "72:43", "about how Oldowan tools which are made", "72:45", "even later than when we first started", "72:49", "walking upright so they're even after", "72:51", "that Oldowan tools are never carried at", "72:53", "any great distance from where they were", "72:54", "quarried and made and so what you have", "72:56", "is an animal just like today's chimps", "72:58", "they can't plan for", "72:59", "tomorrow so chimp can plan for needs", "73:01", "that it currently feels it can say oh I", "73:03", "want to go get termites out of that", "73:06", "Mound all break the stick off I'll strip", "73:08", "the leaves and then I'll go over there", "73:09", "and do that but it can't plan for the", "73:11", "fact that it might have that need again", "73:13", "tomorrow if it doesn't feel the need to", "73:14", "can't plan for it and humans can plan", "73:17", "for unfelt needs and the best example of", "73:19", "that is the notion of taken a tool with", "73:20", "you that you've now used and saying well", "73:22", "I'll want to use it again tomorrow right", "73:23", "so whichever also a Pittacus was the", "73:27", "first one to start walking upright was", "73:29", "almost assuredly incapable of planning", "73:31", "for the future for unfilled needs but it", "73:34", "could plan for filt knees because a", "73:36", "chimp can do that too and if you think", "73:38", "about how would you feel if you're about", "73:40", "to walk across the open savanna and", "73:41", "you're kind of small and leopards and", "73:43", "lions are way fast and you I think the", "73:45", "primary thing you'd feel is fear like oh", "73:47", "shit I'm gonna detect and so I want", "73:49", "something in my hands to help me defend", "73:50", "myself", "73:51", "mmm a spear a club stick something right", "73:54", "and so I what I suspect it's a part of", "73:56", "the process is my desire to hold", "73:58", "something in my hand as I'm looking", "74:00", "around and I'm scared and a bunch of us", "74:01", "are doing that and so I suspect that", "74:04", "that's what led to played a role in", "74:05", "leading to bipedalism there would have", "74:07", "been other factors at play like", "74:08", "persistence hunting and stuff but I", "74:10", "suspect that came later so whole", "74:11", "actually holding a weapon might have led", "74:13", "to the beginning of yeah", "74:15", "yeah sure just because you you don't", "74:16", "need to be a rocket scientist you're", "74:18", "scared now you want something to defend", "74:19", "yourself do we have evidence of them", "74:21", "sharpening sticks remember so modern", "74:24", "chimps who live on the Savannah do", "74:26", "sharpen sticks", "74:26", "modern chimp yeah but do we have", "74:28", "evidence of ancient man and we don't", "74:30", "have any sound we don't even have sticks", "74:32", "leftover fractus we know they must use", "74:34", "them because they're making some pretty", "74:36", "complicated stones and so surely they", "74:38", "were sharpening sticks but all of its", "74:40", "decayed so what year did we so we really", "74:42", "don't know when they first started", "74:44", "attaching these stone tools to sticks", "74:47", "right all weaking axes right Spears um", "74:50", "we know that that's happening very", "74:52", "recently by homo sapiens we don't know", "74:53", "if it happened before that right if I", "74:55", "had to guess I would say that homo", "74:57", "erectus did that if you look at the", "74:58", "quality of other things that they've", "74:59", "done so for example there's this amazing", "75:01", "site off the Sea of Galilee it's about", "75:04", "700 thousand years old so remember human", "75:06", "Homo sapiens let's call it 300,000 years", "75:08", "mm-hmm so now we're 700 thousand or so", "75:10", "years ago and there's this elephant", "75:11", "skull", "75:12", "that's been turned over so that they can", "75:14", "get access trains yeah friend\u00eds yeah", "75:16", "that's that thing is unwieldy it's heavy", "75:18", "as anything you got to have people", "75:19", "working together to turn that thing over", "75:21", "there's even a log underneath it that", "75:23", "might have been used as a lever that's", "75:24", "kind of help plop the thing over so what", "75:27", "you got is people are quite capable of", "75:28", "working together they know what they", "75:29", "trying to

even better it's just that we", "75:39", "can't find any evidence for that least", "75:40", "not yet you wasn't there some there was", "75:42", "certain really ancient evidence of", "75:45", "cannibalism too because of the scrape", "75:47", "marks inside of skulls and they think", "75:49", "they were scooping out brain matter", "75:50", "that's possible I haven't seen those", "75:52", "data but absolutely you can see where", "75:54", "they've used those tools on like the", "75:55", "legs of animals and things like that so", "75:57", "you would see it inside the skull as", "75:58", "well a human skull that I'm sure you're", "76:01", "aware of that little person that was", "76:04", "discovered just a few years ago I think", "76:07", "it was like a decade or so ago that on", "76:09", "Indonesia on the floor is yeah yeah they", "76:12", "think that little person type thing used", "76:15", "two stone tools right yes those guys so", "76:18", "so remember there so what happened about", "76:20", "a one-point X million years ago we'll", "76:22", "call it 1.7 I don't remember exactly", "76:24", "Homo erectus leaves Africa but they also", "76:26", "stay so you got Homo erectus basically", "76:28", "colonizing all of Africa right and", "76:30", "you've got Homo erectus colonizing", "76:31", "almost all of Europe all of southern", "76:33", "Asia and so they don't they don't go", "76:35", "beyond that at least not to our", "76:36", "knowledge maybe they did but but they", "76:39", "certainly covered all that ground and", "76:41", "and outside of so now you've got Homo", "76:44", "erectus in Africa and Homo erectus", "76:45", "outside of Africa and of course then", "76:47", "over time both of them are going to", "76:48", "evolve and change the ones outside of", "76:50", "Africa end up as in the Endor Thals", "76:51", "those are the most recent recent", "76:53", "instantiation of them the ones inside of", "76:55", "Africa end up as us and so when we leave", "76:57", "Africa the first thing we encounter is", "76:59", "Neanderthals in Arabia because that's", "77:01", "the first point of entry out of Africa", "77:03", "and so we probably started copulating", "77:05", "with them there we know we started", "77:06", "copulating with them soon afterward so", "77:08", "as we left they had evolved somewhere", "77:09", "else that evolved in Europe and Asia", "77:11", "yeah yeah and so they evolved from some", "77:13", "other type well the same ancestors so", "77:16", "our okay our great-uncle left and our", "77:18", "great-grandpa stayed right and so the", "77:20", "ones who left some of them evolved into", "77:22", "those people on Flores into those tiny", "77:24", "little people some of them", "77:25", "we know this Denisovan from a pinkie", "77:27", "bone you know in a cave inside yeah yeah", "77:29", "and and we have got we know that we", "77:32", "interbred with Neanderthals and that", "77:33", "that's where a lot of our genes that we", "77:35", "currently have for light skin and blue", "77:37", "eyes and things like that come from and", "77:39", "they think wewe interbred with the", "77:40", "Denisovans as well right well not all of", "77:42", "us so there's some there's evidence for", "77:44", "Melanesians if I remember I having", "77:46", "Denisovan blood our DNA I don't I don't", "77:49", "know about us it may turn out that we", "77:50", "did I don't think so though but there's", "77:54", "no evidence that humans interbred with", "77:56", "the folks from Flores right not that I", "77:58", "know I've never seen that they're tiny", "78:00", "yeah they're very small they're like", "78:01", "Hobbit like now that doesn't mean that", "78:03", "if if well no we know it's possible that", "78:08", "we could have overlapped with them if", "78:09", "somebody would do it yeah so like we hit", "78:12", "we hit Australia by 65 thousand years", "78:15", "ago and I don't remember when the floors", "78:17", "people we hit Australia 65 thousand", "78:19", "years ago Wow and that was through some", "78:21", "sort of boat traveling yeah remember so", "78:24", "65 thousand years ago would have still", "78:26", "been Ice Age and so we would have had a", "78:28", "lot less water right so if you if you", "78:30", "look at topographical maps then when you", "78:32", "look at what the Pacific Islanders", "78:34", "didn't stuff it seems ballsy as hell but", "78:35", "it's a little less ballsy when you can", "78:36", "keep seeing the next piece of land not", "78:38", "not as far away compared to now where", "78:41", "the sea is much higher and you can't see", "78:42", "the land okay so when the Pacific", "78:44", "Islanders like traveled to Hawaii you", "78:46", "think they could see things yeah they", "78:48", "can see a lot better now the most recent", "78:50", "at the very last place the Pacific", "78:52", "Islanders settled in New Zealand that's", "78:53", "only seven hundred years ago so that's", "78:55", "the same as today right but but a lot of", "78:58", "that discovery was done at a time where", "79:00", "the sea was a lot lower and so there'd", "79:02", "be a lot more island sticking up that we", "79:03", "don't currently so 700 years ago they", "79:05", "had much more sophisticated boats", "79:07", "yeah they had those awesome yeah", "79:09", "breakers and all that right yeah it is", "79:10", "crazy when you think about like we're", "79:12", "like little rats with the way we've", "79:14", "scattered across this globe yeah and and", "79:16", "if you if you think about it it seems", "79:18", "like it's all ballsy exploration but I", "79:21", "actually suspect a bigger part of it is", "79:23", "running away from the guy behind you", "79:24", "who's causing problems and so my", "79:26", "favorite example that is if you look at", "79:28", "the cliff dwellings like in the American", "79:30", "Southwest and you go there and take a", "79:32", "note that would live like this I mean", "79:34", "you know when jr. walks out there", "79:36", "but if the people down the valley are", "79:38", "scarier than the risk of falling outside", "79:40", "you came you're gonna live up in a cave", "79:41", "dwelling right we're gonna climb up to", "79:43", "get ya and that's part of the remember", "79:45", "we talked about sexual selection as a", "79:47", "source of people don't like unfairness", "79:49", "well people also don't like unfairness", "79:51", "between groups because if you and I make", "79:53", "a deal and you know I'm from Ohio and", "79:56", "you're from California and the", "79:57", "Californians benefit more than the", "79:58", "Ohioans even though I benefit you", "80:00", "benefit more and now I'm at risk because", "80:02", "maybe your group you know ancestrally", "80:04", "it's gonna cause my group problems", "80:05", "interesting so when you're studying all", "80:09", "this stuff how does that make you feel", "80:11", "as a person do you mean do you do did", "80:13", "you ever internalize all this stuff when", "80:15", "you're thinking about like all the weird", "80:17", "ape-like creatures that turned into", "80:19", "people and all the thousands and", "80:22", "thousands of years of evolution and how", "80:24", "it could have gone left and it did go", "80:27", "right and does that freak you out when", "80:30", "you really get deep into the study of", "80:32", "all this stuff it first of all I do this", "80:33", "all the time right so it does freak me", "80:35", "out but it's what I like and it also we", "80:37", "can talk about all the ways that you can", "80:38", "predict things about our modern cells", "80:40", "based on knowing these things in the", "80:41", "past right but secondarily what freaks", "80:43", "me out the most probably is the enormous", "80:46", "role of random chance in all this right", "80:48", "and so if you think about the I mean", "80:50", "just think about our own backgrounds the", "80:51", "random chance that our mom and dad got", "80:53", "amorous the night that they did made you", "80:55", "and me if if they did a different", "80:57", "position maybe your brother's talking to", "80:59", "my brother right yeah it's so it's", "81:01", "really which sperm wins that race is so", "81:03", "unlikely to be us right and so every", "81:05", "roll of the dice has to go your way", "81:07", "right and so the the role of chance in", "81:09", "all this kind of freaks you out if you", "81:11", "think about that yeah but at the same", "81:12", "time your brother's probably a lot like", "81:14", "you my brother's probably a lot like me", "81:16", "or my sister or whatever and so you have", "81:19", "one child or you have more I've got a", "81:20", "boy a girl okay yeah well you know then", "81:22", "that they're so different right out of", "81:24", "the box", "81:25", "yeah they are totally really weird it is", "81:27", "weird so I don't know if you saw this", "81:29", "book that Plomin just wrote called", "81:30", "blueprint Robert Plomin he's a", "81:32", "behavioural geneticist I haven't seen", "81:34", "that oh it's a lovely book just came out", "81:36", "and just out like really yeah like a", "81:38", "month or two at the most", "81:41", "PLO mi and Robert Plomin and he's a", "81:47", "wonderful behavior of geneticist over", "81:49", "in the UK and this book blueprint talks", "81:52", "about the role of genes and all this and", "81:54", "he he basically is one of these people", "81:57", "who's been in the field almost since it", "81:58", "got started and and what they kept", "82:00", "thinking is that the environment was", "82:01", "gonna play a huge role the parents were", "82:04", "gonna play a huge role but of course", "82:06", "what they keep finding over and over", "82:07", "again", "82:08", "there he goes how Danny makes us who we", "82:10", "are and and what they find over and over", "82:13", "again and this was so disconcerting is", "82:14", "first of all on average most things are", "82:16", "about 50% genetic but the bummer is that", "82:20", "the other half isn't and isn't what's", "82:21", "happening in your house and the way you", "82:23", "brought up by your folks it's the random", "82:25", "other stuff like the first we don't even", "82:27", "know what it is it's just it's what we", "82:29", "call unshared environment maybe that", "82:30", "first girlfriend you had maybe you biked", "82:32", "into a tree and you unimproved your face", "82:33", "you know a million different things that", "82:35", "specifically happened to you that didn't", "82:37", "happen to everybody else in your family", "82:39", "right and also the way you address those", "82:42", "things that happened yeah and that could", "82:43", "have a factor it could be a factor in", "82:45", "how you were raised and how you were", "82:47", "taught to deal with stress how you were", "82:49", "taught to deal with situations and", "82:51",

"82:58", "we parse up all the different traits", "83:00", "about you there's a few that your", "83:02", "parents actually have a big influence on", "83:03", "it what religion you're in for example", "83:05", "but not how religious you are so the", "83:07", "biggest role that you can play seems to", "83:09", "be when spermatic it's a friend of mine", "83:11", "the analogy they made when when I when I", "83:13", "had my first kid is he says here's what", "83:15", "you're gonna find out that you're handed", "83:17", "when the baby's born you're handed a", "83:19", "negative it's the pictures already been", "83:20", "taken you can screw it up by being in", "83:22", "the darkroom a little bit wrong or you", "83:24", "can help it a little bit by being in the", "83:25", "darkroom a little bit right", "83:27", "but the photograph is already there and", "83:29", "my son and my daughter are wildly", "83:30", "different in some ways in some ways are", "83:32", "quite similar but I feel like

that's what we", "83:41", "do right but the data say no well but", "83:44", "how would the data know I mean how would", "83:46", "you so here's how we do have to study so", "83:48", "many different human beings you have to", "83:50", "you have to take into account all the", "83:52", "variables that took place during all the", "83:54", "developmental periods of their life", "83:56", "well the you to do it right you need to", "83:58", "do all that and we can't do that yet and", "83:59", "to do it right what you want is actually", "84:01", "to have that", "84:01", "the actual genetic markers not just to", "84:04", "know the genes of their right and that's", "84:06", "all starting now but but we don't know", "84:08", "yet what they do do is they'll say well", "84:10", "we got a bunch where there's two ways to", "84:11", "go about this employment was at the", "84:12", "front of both of them one you look at", "84:14", "adoptive studies versus kids were", "84:16", "adopted into a family versus biological", "84:18", "and you can compare the parents of the", "84:21", "adopted kids to the biological parents", "84:23", "versus the home parents and it turns out", "84:26", "that the biological parents predict a", "84:27", "whole lot more about the adopted child", "84:29", "and the parents who raised them mmm the", "84:31", "parents were raised and predict almost", "84:32", "nothing whoa", "84:33", "I know and then the second thing you can", "84:35", "do is you can look at fraternal versus", "84:38", "monozygotic identical twins and you find", "84:41", "that when you then they all share the", "84:44", "same environment they're all brought up", "84:45", "by you and me right were the parents of", "84:47", "these kids but they also there's a lot", "84:50", "of unshared environment and that's when", "84:52", "they differ it's not because of you and", "84:54", "me we can't find any evidence that you", "84:56", "and me that you and I made any", "84:57", "difference all we can find is evidence", "84:59", "that other things in their life made a", "85:01", "difference now to say that means what we", "85:03", "really don't know is well what is that", "85:04", "unshared environment all we know is it's", "85:06", "not something about your household", "85:07", "because that would cause fraternal and", "85:09", "identical twins to both be more similar", "85:11", "to each other right and it doesn't well", "85:14", "and obviously a lot there's not a lot of", "85:17", "data in terms of when you're measuring", "85:19", "someone's entire life from birth to", "85:21", "death we know no but there's there's", "85:23", "enough that people are starting to draw", "85:25", "conclusions one of the more interesting", "85:26", "ones is when you see identical twins", "85:29", "that were raised in different households", "85:30", "without any knowledge of each other yeah", "85:33", "and then they run into each other thirty", "85:35", "years later and they find out they have", "85:37", "disturbing similarities is that's", "85:39", "exactly another example and what's also", "85:40", "interesting about it which Blauman talks", "85:42", "about in blueprint is that your genes", "85:44", "become more powerful as you age", "85:47", "so the heritability of things like IQ", "85:50", "goes up as you get older and so the", "85:52", "argument is that your genes seem to be", "85:53", "causing you to select out environments", "85:55", "so you gave the example well maybe the", "85:57", "way that you discipline them or tell", "85:59", "them to be resilient or whatever you do", "86:01", "as a parent causes them to shape their", "86:03", "environment it doesn't seem to be the", "86:05", "case but it does seem to be the case", "86:06", "that that genes that you give them cause", "86:08", "them to select their environments in", "86:09", "certain ways because remember kids", "86:11", "choose their friends right mm-hmm you", "86:13", "want them to play with Timmy but they", "86:14", "want to play with", "86:15", "right that's that's the unshared", "86:18", "environment they're making those choices", "86:19", "every day it's also the case that their", "86:21", "peers matter a whole lot more than their", "86:23", "parents do once they get to a certain", "86:24", "age you know I'm chopped liver as soon", "86:26", "as my kids are a bit older but when I'm", "86:27", "young I'm their hero", "86:29", "right yes now when you say that your", "86:32", "genes become more powerful as you get", "86:35", "older what do you mean by that though", "86:36", "well they they are more predictive of", "86:38", "the outcome and so if you look at the", "86:40", "heritability of IQ when you're a kid", "86:41", "it's lower than when you're an adult and", "86:43", "it's lower still than when you're an", "86:44", "older adult and so what seems to be", "86:46", "happening to a lot of our traits", "86:47", "probably almost you sure are you saying", "86:49", "that like if you have children as an", "86:52", "older person it's inevitable as the kids", "86:55", "get older sorry okay so is it so if you", "86:57", "look at the heritability of IQ when kids", "86:59", "are 2 4 8 10 20 60 you find that", "87:04", "identical twins come more and more", "87:06", "together as they age whether they're", "87:07", "aging in the same household or not and", "87:09", "so there's it's something about", "87:11", "selecting your environments so like", "87:12", "here's one kid who loves to think and do", "87:14", "puzzles and it's identical to and loves", "87:15", "to do the same and they kind of get", "87:17", "smarter their whole lives", "87:18", "here's another kid who's not interested", "87:19", "in that they have other interest and", "87:21", "they go in a different direction but", "87:22", "when you're when you're the parent you", "87:24", "can be busily pushing them to do the", "87:25", "things you want them to do right and so", "87:27", "there heritability is less strong and", "87:29", "there's there's lots of cool examples", "87:30", "it's like when totalitarian governments", "87:32", "are eliminated and the school system", "87:34", "becomes more fair heritability of", "87:36", "intelligence goes up in those societies", "87:37", "because kids are now more capable of", "87:39", "selecting the schools they want to go to", "87:41", "the environments that they want to be", "87:42", "part of wow we're so flexible it's so", "87:46", "weird when you think about all the the", "87:48", "various styles of civilization that", "87:51", "human beings exist in and thrive in", "87:53", "right and for me that's the key so when", "87:56", "a lot of people hear about this they", "87:57", "sort it sounds like genetic determinism", "87:59", "that your genes are forcing you to be a", "88:01", "certain way but for me it's theirs it's", "88:03", "nothin etic determinism but you can", "88:05", "think of about as a genetic nudge part", "88:07", "of your nudge is gonna come from the DNA", "88:09", "your inherited but part of it's gonna", "88:10", "come from the environment and part of", "88:11", "its gonna come from your own personal", "88:12", "decisions yeah so in my mind we talk", "88:15", "about in terms of your mind because", "88:16", "that's what psychology but an easier", "88:19", "example is your muscles you know some", "88:21", "people inherit genes that if they lift", "88:22", "one weight once but they're not they're", "88:24", "both other people's genes they have to", "88:26", "workout a lot if they want to gain", "88:27", "anything but you can still decide I'm", "88:29", "gonna", "88:29", "work out a lot or I'm not I'm gonna eat", "88:32", "these nutrients or you know a lot of", "88:33", "protein or not um you can choose a", "88:35", "lifestyle that leads you to be more", "88:36", "muscular or less so it's partially", "88:38", "choice it's partially environment it's", "88:40", "partially that interaction between your", "88:42", "genes in environment which would make", "88:44", "sense if you think about how flexible we", "88:45", "are absolutely it has adaptive that we", "88:48", "are it has to be because human beings", "88:49", "have to learn how to survive in every", "88:51", "environment on this planet if we were", "88:52", "meerkats or something well we got a", "88:54", "certain way of doing things and you your", "88:55", "genes can basically tell you what to do", "88:57", "and with meerkats there's some really", "88:58", "interesting experiments where you can", "89:00", "show your genes cause you to listen to", "89:01", "one signal and just follow that but as", "89:03", "human beings your genes have no choice", "89:05", "but to give up control once we went down",

"90:33", "be the good and everybody else and", "90:34", "that's just not gonna happen", "90:36", "because one of the things that we know", "90:37", "and you'll see this if you look at", "90:38", "blueprint is that you have a gazillion", "90:40", "genes underlie every trait there aren't", "90:42", "five smart", "90:43", "Jeanne's there's like a thousand of them", "90:45", "and furthermore each one of them only", "90:47", "accounts for a tiny tiny bit and they do", "90:49", "lots of other things too so you can't", "90:51", "like design you can't make a design or", "90:52", "baby that has all these qualities", "90:54", "because all you do is noodle around with", "90:55", "five or six genes there's a couple of", "90:57", "disorders that work that way but our", "90:58", "personalities our

and more innovation takes place", "91:27", "in in that world don't you think they're", "91:30", "gonna get to a point where they're gonna", "91:31", "understand all the various factors in", "91:33",

"91:49", "with the ones that aren't now what makes", "91:52", "it complicated is that most of the ones", "91:54", "that differ between people are actually", "91:56", "none there in what we now call

Association", "92:27", "studies is that you can look at all the", "92:29", "very base pairs at very and you can say", "92:32", "all right which one of these things are", "92:34", "correlate with my

you're gonna get and sure", "92:43", "enough the richer you are on average the", "92:47", "higher your polygenic score is you're", "92:49", "born into a rich family you probably", "92:50", "have a

and there's a", "93:06", "thousand things in there and each one of", "93:08", "them accounts for 1/10 of 1% of the", "93:10", "variance but what makes it complicated", "93:12", "is that whole set of genes also predicts", "93:15", "how artistic you are but in a different", "93:16", "combination and it predicts how friendly", "93:18", "you are in a different combination and", "93:19", "so the genes that do one set of things", "93:22", "almost always do lots of things and we", "93:25", "have very few traits at all that don't", "93:27", "have lots and lots of genes that each", "93:28", "play a

we're looking for gold dust it's", "93:37", "just lots of tiny stuff out there so in", "93:40", "many ways when you're looking at a 1 you", "93:44", "know you talk about the the the human", "93:46",

type of human look in", "94:33", "principle it could and and it may when", "94:36", "all I would say is that you that what we", "94:39", "thought though is that there'd be five", "94:40", "smart genes that really matter and the", "94:43", "rest are trivial and so turn on those", "94:44", "five smart ones everybody's gonna want", "94:46", "that right and there'll be five funny", "94:47", "genes and we'll turn those on you know", "94:49", "etc but there's not and so what that", "94:50", "means is I got to decide imagine this", "94:53", "future world where I'm about to have a", "94:54", "baby and I can CRISPR the whole thing", "94:55", "and I have to decide what genes I'll say", "94:57", "well I can make him smarter but then", "94:59", "he's not going to be very friendly you", "95:00", "know right or whatever right they all", "95:02", "trade off against each other right you", "95:04", "could get the big dick gene but it", "95:05", "doesn't see it", "95:07", "give them glasses exactly and so the", "95:11", "thing is that it makes it so yeah we", "95:13", "will get rid of thing the single gene", "95:15", "disorders that are awful right but but", "95:17", "we're not gonna I suspect we're not", "95:20", "gonna noodle around with our smarts and", "95:21", "our personality because every single", "95:23", "change we make is gonna have a commence", "95:25", "or change somewhere else oh well I can", "95:26", "make him smarter but then he's gonna be", "95:27", "depressed and he's you know like that", "95:29", "yeah that that is a boy the the idea of", "95:34", "playing God like that I mean that's", "95:36", "that's really I mean we are playing", "95:39", "creator you know I don't even", "95:40", "necessarily think we should use the word", "95:41", "God in that respect because it's", "95:43", "something that's already been created", "95:44", "but we're taking this life-form and", "95:46", "radically altering it and we can already", "95:49", "do that and people won't start doing it", "95:51", "soon and we like when I was a kid when", "95:53", "we were kids IVF is playing God mm-hmm", "95:56", "now it's a triviality right that is", "95:59", "crazy", "96:00", "what we're you know do you don't think", "96:03", "that this is going to take place in our", "96:04", "lifetime to move Russia or China is", "96:05", "gonna make some super person not there's", "96:08", "there's too many genes that play too", "96:09", "small of a role and so the thing is that", "96:11", "the it it's too hard to mess around with", "96:16", "it's too hard to make the to create", "96:18", "these things", "96:18", "there's no reason you'd be a lot better", "96:19", "off if you just did selective breeding", "96:21", "and the reality is you don't even need", "96:22", "to people already assorted

other person", "96:31", "does too", "96:32", "that works so much better than anything", "96:34", "that we're capable of doing right now", "96:35", "and when you do these G Wells studies", "96:38",

"96:45", "get poorer across your life", "96:46", "you're literally accounting for 3% of", "96:48", "the variance you're barely explaining", "96:50", "anything because even though we when we", "96:52", "look at the behavioral genetic studies", "96:54", "we can say wow intelligence is 50", "96:56", "percent genetic we can't come close to", "96:58", "finding the genes that actually do that", "97:00", "and and part of the reason we don't know", "97:02", "but part of the reason may be that first", "97:05", "of all its course is 50% environmental", "97:06", "and what those random things are we", "97:08", "don't know and second think about how", "97:10", "you with 3 billion base pairs how many", "97:11", "things maybe when those two are in place", "97:13", "and that one isn't in the third you know", "97:15", "you could be interactions that really", "97:16", "really complicated levels where you're", "97:18", "almost dead infinite right and so that's", "97:20", "why I don't think it happens when", "97:21", "you and I around to see it I think", "97:23", "you're probably right but then I just", "97:25", "realized that things like CRISPR which", "97:28", "were invented by accident who came out", "97:31", "of nowhere less than a decade ago I", "97:33", "believe was less than a decade ago right", "97:34", "it's super recent it's outside yeah and", "97:37", "then if you really stop and think about", "97:39", "even the mapping of the human genome it", "97:42", "used to be an unbelievably difficult", "97:44", "thing yeah and then you know checking", "97:47", "your genetics was preposterous ly", "97:49", "expensive now you just spit into a", "97:51", "little to end of the 23andme and they", "97:54", "they tell you hey bro you know someone's", "97:56", "family is from Europe and this guy's", "97:58", "from Asia and yeah yeah and so I could", "98:01", "easily be wrong that you and I will see", "98:03", "it and it's only ten years away yeah", "98:04", "because computationally it seems so hard", "98:06", "right now but things that were", "98:07", "computationally impossible and I was in", "98:08", "grad school you know that the simple", "98:10", "analyses we did with our data in grad", "98:11", "school it's just like a phone could do", "98:14", "that so easily now when we waited 24", "98:16", "hours for the mainframe to give it back", "98:17", "to us", "98:17", "what Kurzweil talks about that that we", "98:20", "really don't see things in terms of the", "98:22", "exponential increase in technology you", "98:25", "know Kurzweil believes all this is gonna", "98:27", "happen plus more he thinks you're gonna", "98:28", "be able to download your brain into a", "98:30", "computer and you know and he supported", "98:33", "ourselves he's smarter than me I don't", "98:34", "know if he's smarter than you he's", "98:35", "definitely smarter than me and his idea", "98:37", "is research has just turned on the", "98:39", "world's most powerful

but here's the thing", "98:59", "right this movie in this movie this is a", "99:02", "whole room full of computers just like", "99:04", "the Apollo missions used a room full of", "99:06", "computers that can't fuck with your", "99:08", "phone really crazy", "99:10", "that's 1965 66 67 right they had a room", "99:16", "this iPhone buries that room full of", "99:19", "fucking shitty ass computers and plus it", "99:21", "takes pictures", "99:22", "do you remember one of your kids and", "99:23", "everybody said everyone will have their", "99:24", "own phone right I never thinking who the", "99:26", "hell wants a phone like my mom will just", "99:28", "reach me wherever I go you didn't know", "99:29", "what a phone could do in those used to", "99:31", "have a bit and this is only from 2005", "99:34", "from a Netflix special I did", "99:35", "2005 which you know it's 13 years ago", "99:39", "but doesn't seem like that long ago but", "99:41", "I was making fun of people texting", "99:44", "uh-huh because I was like hey bro why", "99:47", "why are you making me read call me I go", "99:50", "you're sending the text from a phone a", "99:52", "fucking call me takes you four presses", "99:55", "to get an S yeah and then that was also", "100:01", "back when people thought it was cool to", "100:03", "have those walkie-talkies those Nextel", "100:05", "phones do you remember that there that", "100:07", "was like a big deal to have a walkie", "100:08", "talkie and a phone that died out", "100:10", "thankfully but this this whole change in", "100:14", "the way we view technology from 2005 to", "100:18", "2008 een the world is a radically", "100:21", "different place and the funny thing is", "100:23", "that you and I both make a living by", "100:24", "observing the human condition right", "100:26", "that's our job and we both get it wrong", "100:28", "constantly right every day you got that", "100:30", "the texting what the hell is that I", "100:31", "remember my sister showed me Facebook", "100:33", "cuz she was in an NGO and they're using", "100:35", "it to keep track of each other I was", "100:36", "like yeah people don't want to do that", "100:37", "shit every time every single time I", "100:41", "follow quite a few people on Facebook", "100:44", "that are nuts and I go to their pages", "100:47", "just to see what kind of arguments are", "100:49", "getting into like as a sociological", "100:51", "experiment and there are people that are", "100:54", "on Facebook arguing about Trump or", "100:58", "abortion or Islam or you know fill in", "101:02", "the blank environmental concerns", "101:03", "fracking and they just fucking argue all", "101:06", "day long it's fascinating you look at", "101:10", "their timeline you look at the entries", "101:12", "and you're like oh my god this there's", "101:14", "like 10 hours of this shit in a day and", "101:16", "they just do it all day long and you", "101:18", "just picture this sweaty person sitting", "101:22", "in front of a computer arguing with the", "101:24", "world I never would have thought that", "101:26", "that there'd be people sitting in front", "101:28", "of their desk arguing with people that", "101:30", "they can't see all throughout the world", "101:32", "who thought that right who thought that", "101:34", "would be fun I don't think it is funny I", "101:37", "think it's an impulsive obsessive thing", "101:39", "that people get sucked into and I think", "101:41", "they're vastly healthier and happier", "101:43", "when they're not engaged in it yeah well", "101:45", "I mean the truth of the matter is and", "101:46", "this comes back to the past again so you", "101:47", "we talked about all these differences", "101:49", "so one of the really lovely things that", "101:50", "you can do is look for the past and then", "101:52", "say well how does that manifest itself", "101:53", "today and one of my favorite examples is", "101:56", "the whites to your eyes so chimpanzees", "101:58", "have brown eyes the the sclera round the", "102:00", "cornea yeah ours are white why would you", "102:03", "do that well that advertises the", "102:04", "direction of your gaze why would you", "102:06", "advertise the direction of your gaze", "102:07", "because what that says is that on", "102:09", "average as a human when I look over", "102:11", "there and see something I want you to", "102:12", "know that I saw it you and I are", "102:14", "probably going to cooperate to help us", "102:16", "achieve whatever the goal is that I just", "102:17", "encountered a chimp wants to hide it", "102:20", "from its fellow chimps because it's", "102:21", "competitive right on average whatever", "102:24", "the hell's over there you're not gonna", "102:25", "help me get it right yeah exactly you're", "102:28", "gonna make it harder for me to get it", "102:29", "yeah the chimps ever do though hmm", "102:31", "amazing Laura Jamie oh girl huh", "102:34", "amazingly groupers and octopi hunt", "102:36", "together and they do that", "102:37", "whoa groupers and octopi work together", "102:39", "that so the grouper will be over the", "102:41", "Great Barrier Reef and the fish has gone", "102:43", "in and he goes to the octopus and he", "102:45", "goes right there no reason he doesn't", "102:47", "give a shit about the octopus of course", "102:48", "but if the octopus goes to get it and", "102:50", "doesn't get it it's gonna come out and", "102:51", "the groupers got it well cooperation", "102:53", "always works better than working on your", "102:55", "own right Wow so is there real evidence", "102:58", "it shows that the whites of our eyes", "102:59", "developed in order to indicate which way", "103:01", "we're looking well in all these cases", "103:03", "all we can just say let's do a little", "103:05", "phylogenetic analysis who's got it and", "103:07", "who doesn't we're the only great ape", "103:08", "with whites to their eyes so 90 so we're", "103:11", "gonna look at this here's an octopus", "103:13", "that's chilling and is that a grouper", "103:16", "yeah it's a weird-looking fan since", "103:18", "about it I guess I don't know if it", "103:19", "really pretty looks like a coral trout", "103:21", "to me oh man so what do I know", "103:23", "look how pretty that octopus is - yeah", "103:25", "they're really fucking love octave and", "103:27", "they can change colors like that I know", "103:29", "yeah we've gone down massive rabbit", "103:31", "holes with these things for hours at a", "103:33", "time look at this changing right now as", "103:35", "we're watching him so he's sitting there", "103:38", "waiting and the fish tries to get out", "103:41", "and the other fish got you yeah that's", "103:45", "fine and so it's really cool the way", "103:46", "they have the good sense to work", "103:47", "together look at the octopuses mad it's", "103:49", "getting dark gore has a yard how cool", "103:52", "his skin is how it just changes and", "103:55", "morphs as you're looking at it that is", "103:56", "so bizarre what a crate I didn't you", "103:59", "know I didn't know that they could do", "104:00", "this until my friend Remy war", "104:02", "came on the podcast and he had a", "104:05", "television show called apex predator and", "104:07", "what in on the show they would study the", "104:10", "various ways these animals would hunt", "104:12", "and the way they would you know all", "104:14", "their the different adaptation to their", "104:17", "environment all the different ways that", "104:19", "they would use the environment and and", "104:21", "he would try to mimic those different", "104:23", "ways and one of the things that they", "104:25", "studied was octopus and what's that", "104:28", "other fish that's like it the cuttlefish", "104:30", "which is also the octopus is using a", "104:34", "clam shell what is he doing he's", "104:37", "lounging they found that he picked it up", "104:39", "oh my god there's a BBC this is crazy", "104:44", "oh my god the octopus is climbing inside", "104:47", "a clamshell and then he closes it that", "104:50", "is bananas there's a BBC blue planet", "104:54", "where it shows the octopus picking up", "104:55", "all that random shrapnel when there's a", "104:57", "shark coming after it and it covers", "104:59",

"105:06", "found this aquarium was having an issue", "105:09", "where sharks were disappearing they", "105:11", "couldn't figure out what was going on", "105:12", "and they put a camera inside the", "105:14", "aquarium but it turned out that the", "105:16", "octopus was waiting just chilling on the", "105:19", "rocks till the sharks came by and they", "105:21", "would snatch them and eat them watch", "105:23", "this it's really cool to watch he's like", "105:25", "doo-doo-doo who me don't bother with me", "105:27", "I'm just a piece of coral I'm just", "105:29", "hanging out here being cool bitch that's", "105:31", "you like in cuz he looks exactly yeah", "105:35", "even in texture like the coral which is", "105:38", "so fascinating but when they found this", "105:40", "they were stunned they had no idea that", "105:43", "octopus could do that could not only", "105:45", "that they could do that but that they", "105:47", "would eat a shark and that's a big fight", "105:49", "fuck man it's not though you want to", "105:52", "squeeze his mouth shut first but it's an", "105:54", "easy fight it looks like he's the thing", "105:56", "about octopus though too they could", "105:58", "sacrifice a tentacle and it just grows", "105:59", "back yeah sorry there really no big deal", "106:01", "it's annoying but yeah yeah", "106:03", "I don't know it's annoying I mean we're", "106:05", "just guessing right so there's a", "106:06", "fascinating animal there's a rich", "106:10", "twisted them up there's an amazing case", "106:13", "in Australia where a Coulomb brown as a",

one side", "106:23", "a bunch of males on the other so male", "106:25", "goes in between them and he signals to", "106:27", "different sides of his body he shows the", "106:28", "females he's male but he shows the males", "106:30", "that he's female so they won't attack", "106:32", "him for a sideline out to the female", "106:34", "it's weird it's weird that they split", "106:38", "off from us hundreds of millions of", "106:40", "years ago right like it's closely", "106:41", "related to celery bass yeah that's crazy", "106:44", "but they're so smart and their eyes are", "106:46", "similar to ours and like in the", "106:49", "development actually it's the opposite", "106:51", "so they're our eyes are poorly designed", "106:52", "there's a very well designed so our eyes", "106:54", "have all the detecting stuff is in its", "106:57", "own way it's backwards and so the light", "106:59", "comes in and has to pass all the", "107:00", "cellular bodies before I can get picked", "107:02", "up by the detectors theirs aim in the", "107:04", "proper direction so the shit isn't in", "107:05", "the way and we have this blind spot", "107:07", "because the big thing the the nerve", "107:09", "connection they don't there's comes in", "107:11", "from the back where it belongs", "107:13", "so what that tells you is that yeah we", "107:15", "both started out with some kind of", "107:16", "randoms", "107:16", "light-sensitive spot and there's happen", "107:19", "to work much better if you want to turn", "107:20", "it into an eyeball than ours did because", "107:22", "evolution can

I think it's purely random", "107:31", "that they don't we do a great job of", "107:33", "getting rid of the cellular bodies that", "107:35", "are in our way so what your eye does is", "107:36", "it

"107:50", "we're literally attached to Vince she", "107:51", "would disappear mhm and because your", "107:53", "brain says oh that's irrelevant", "107:55", "um and so you can't see your own blind", "107:56", "spot unless you close one eye and then", "107:58", "you sit there with a neutral background", "108:00", "you move your thumb across and literally", "108:02", "your thumbnail disappears because that", "108:04", "spot is just being filled in by whatever", "108:06", "the background and what happens with the", "108:08", "octopus it doesn't have that problem", "108:09", "because our nerve anding creates a blind", "108:11", "spot by being on the wrong side there's", "108:13", "comes in from the back and so the whole", "108:15", "thing works beautifully there", "108:16", "have to deal with the blind spots would", "108:18", "that be as effective though in the world", "108:20", "that we live in yeah it's a watery or", "108:22", "irrelevant it's purely a happenstance", "108:24", "that with the light-sensitive pit that", "108:27", "they had started to get innovated", "108:29", "properly from the back and ours didn't", "108:30", "and then as ours evolved into an eye I", "108:33", "mean of course we don't know this is", "108:34", "just", "108:34", "but as ours evolved too and I we just", "108:36", "had to find ways around the problem that", "108:37", "all the fancy structures that we now", "108:39", "need in front of it are in the way does", "108:41", "anything have an eye like an octopus", "108:42", "that lives on land great question I", "108:45", "don't know I don't think so", "108:46", "see I've read something about eyes that", "108:48", "they think that I got shit information", "108:50", "no you're pregnant memory that they have", "108:52", "an amazing memory all these shows that", "108:54", "you still throw away that's too many", "108:56", "shows man I don't have any memory", "108:58", "anymore so it's like full yeah I've like", "109:00", "I'm like a hoarder like my house is", "109:02", "filled with boxes of shit that I don't", "109:04", "need", "109:04", "that's how brains work I'm afraid our", "109:07", "brains work yeah I mean it must be", "109:09", "because like I know that there's a lot", "109:12", "of stuff in there that didn't used to be", "109:13", "in there before but I also know like", "109:15", "it's like random people that I should", "109:17", "remember that I don't remember yeah well", "109:19", "then the funny thing about brains is we", "109:20", "may never forget anything but we just", "109:22", "lose our capacity to access it right but", "109:24", "the data suggested it may still guide", "109:26", "our behavior and so every single", "109:27", "experience you ever had may still be in", "109:29", "there and it guides your behavior but", "109:31", "but it's use it's annoying for you to", "109:32", "recall it cuz it gets in the way of what", "109:33", "you want and so when we talk about", "109:35", "forgetting what we're actually talking", "109:36", "about is being able to actually retrieve", "109:38", "it and talk about it not to have it", "109:40", "guide with our action well also I can I", "109:42", "could retrieve things far better if I", "109:45", "get access to the file by someone else's", "109:48", "memory so like if you and I had an", "109:50", "experience like 10 years ago we went on", "109:52", "a camping trip or something like that", "109:53", "and I forgot something that happened and", "109:56", "you said do you remember what happened", "109:57", "by the creek when Mike for hurt his foot", "109:58", "I'm like oh yes exactly", "110:01", "oh my god I forgot about that and then", "110:02", "you know it's of this memory right and", "110:05", "so what we've done is you've broken", "110:06", "access in yeah and so but if you you", "110:09", "could literally find the sneakers", "110:10", "wearing oh holy crap right we're in this", "110:12", "you know and so that's how our brain is", "110:14", "designed it it's it's annoying to", "110:16", "retrieve when you're looking for one", "110:17", "thing to retrieve everything yes if it's", "110:20", "important or happened recently it", "110:22", "probably should be retrieved if it's not", "110:23", "let it sit away and it'll still guide", "110:26", "your baby you won't put your foot in", "110:27", "that same hole when you and Mike go on", "110:29", "the camping trip the next time", "110:30", "but you won't even remember why right", "110:32", "and unlikely significant lessons are", "110:35", "important because they're seared in your", "110:37", "memory of this is uh this is a", "110:38", "significant point where you figured", "110:40", "something out", "110:40", "that you didn't know before and it", "110:41", "changed the way you looked at the world", "110:43", "so this is seared in your memory yeah", "110:45", "and so when emotions get involved you", "110:47", "tend to have it's much more easily", "110:49", "retrieve because your brain is saying", "110:51", "yeah that's our evolution or whatever", "110:52", "you wanna call it it's telling you", "110:53", "that's important that should be", "110:55", "retrievable right and and what you had", "110:57", "yesterday for lunch", "110:58", "I can never retrieve that right yeah", "111:00", "that's one of the reasons why", "111:02", "epidemiology studies on diet are so", "111:04", "difficult because people don't remember", "111:06", "what the aim is they eat the same same", "111:08", "thing every day yeah yeah it's the human", "111:10", "mind is so fascinating and it varies so", "111:13", "much and there's so many different", "111:14", "factors involved and whatever it becomes", "111:17", "cultural factors and yeah environmental", "111:20", "factors dietary factors and that's all", "111:23", "that flexibility that we evolved to put", "111:25", "us in that special place that we are", "111:27", "yeah and so we made a deal right so we", "111:29", "said alright we're gonna start going", "111:30", "down this cognitive pathway but that", "111:32", "means that there's very little inborn", "111:33", "knowledge and that means that we're", "111:35", "gonna have to learn from people older", "111:36", "than us and people with experience there", "111:38", "and that means it and the best way to", "111:40", "learn from them is high-fidelity copying", "111:42", "and so if you happen to go off in the", "111:43", "direction where they use chopsticks well", "111:45", "that's how you eat you happen to go in a", "111:46", "fork direction that's how you eat", "111:48", "there's a million ways to do things and", "111:49", "so we started with the sort of argument", "111:51", "about well was it monogamy or not right", "111:53", "and the I'm arguing that by and large it", "111:56", "was monogamy because you've got these", "111:58", "systems in place that our testicles are", "112:00", "big enough we've got cryptic ovulation", "112:02", "which means that we can't tell when", "112:03", "she's fertile which means that we have", "112:05", "to be available sexually interested in", "112:07", "available all the time so we can make", "112:08", "sure we're the father and so that allows", "112:11", "her to pair bond with us and there's", "112:12", "some evidence that orgasm is a pair", "112:14", "bonding experience certainly for females", "112:16", "probably for males it works in lots of", "112:18", "animals via oxytocin and some", "112:20", "vasopressin all that kind of stuff right", "112:22", "so all that suggests that probably on", "112:25", "average that we evolved to do it this", "112:27", "way but we're so SuperDuper flexible", "112:28", "that when another society says well hey", "112:30", "these works for us off we go and we find", "112:32", "a way to make that work are there", "112:34", "studies that compare testicle size of", "112:36", "different civilizations and different", "112:38", "cultures yeah so there's a lot of", "112:40", "argument about this", "112:41", "and the problem is that the president's", "112:43", "racist a it's racist right that's what", "112:45", "underlies a lot of it but right so the", "112:48", "thing is that that the the genetics that", "112:51", "explain why one animal or one species", "112:53", "would have large testicles in other word", "112:55", "have small testicles are not the", "112:56", "genetics that it would explain why two", "112:58", "different individuals in the same", "112:59", "species would be that way because the", "113:01", "only way to make that latter one work is", "113:03", "you have to inherit a constellation of", "113:05", "traits so if I'm gonna hare the genes", "113:07", "for big balls and for impulsiveness and", "113:10", "for having lots of kids and not caring", "113:12", "much about them and all the things that", "113:14", "are supposedly go with that that do when", "113:16", "you look between species there's no way", "113:18", "for though that constellation of traits", "113:19", "to be inherited together because", "113:21", "remember I was talking about how", "113:22", "polygenic everything is and so they'd", "113:24", "all literally need to sit next to each", "113:25", "other on the chromosome if they've got", "113:27", "any chance of being passed on as a", "113:28", "package and they don't and you also get", "113:31", "all this shifting around or in meiosis I", "113:33", "can't remember the term for off the top", "113:35", "of my head but where the pieces of", "113:38",

"113:45", "is dead easy you know your species", "113:47", "inherits big distil and inherits", "113:49", "impulsiveness it inherits you know", "113:50", "whatever in our strategy just reproduce", "113:53", "it on and ignore them you know all that", "113:55", "kind of stuff steady Z and so chimp", "113:57", "fathers don't pay any attention to chimp", "113:58", "babies to speak of because well that's", "114:01", "their mating system right whereas um", "114:03", "you've got pair-bonded Gibbons and", "114:05", "things and now parents start to play a", "114:07", "much bigger even male parents start to", "114:08", "play a bigger role but there's no", "114:09", "studies that show that human beings with", "114:11", "larger testicles tend to ignore their", "114:13", "children well so this is just it people", "114:15", "have tried to show that but here's the", "114:16", "problem try to show that ya studies yeah", "114:19", "so lots of people make that argument and", "114:21", "it's called life history strategies", "114:22", "where you say well you're gonna develop", "114:24", "one life history strategy in these", "114:25", "circumstances and another in these other", "114:27", "circumstances the problem is that you", "114:29", "end up with ethnic differences in", "114:30", "testicle size which we know exists and", "114:32", "you also have ethnic differences and", "114:35", "we're how in in the kinds of life's that", "114:37", "people currently lead the difficult", "114:39", "thing is it's super easy to look at the", "114:40", "world we are in right now and this is", "114:42", "what tripped me up earlier as well you", "114:44", "look at the world that we are right now", "114:45", "in assume well that's the way things", "114:46", "have always been and they haven't and so", "114:48", "right now you know the mathematics used", "114:51", "to for a while they're the best math in", "114:53", "the world was taking place in the Arabic", "114:54", "world", "114:55",

some", "115:10", "different West African groups happen of", "115:12", "the largest testicle size on average", "115:14", "those West African groups tend to be", "115:17", "poorer right now there's lots of things", "115:19", "about life that go with being poorer", "115:20", "that look like in our strategy having", "115:22", "lots of kids and paying less attention", "115:24", "to them but what you're

really", "116:07", "excited that you know me and my family", "116:08", "were very curious about these things too", "116:10", "but one of the things that he said", "116:11", "what's really interesting I said ok I go", "116:13", "why did all the dudes have little dicks", "116:15", "like what's going on with that and he", "116:17", "said that they believed that if you had", "116:21", "a large penis

you wanted a smaller penis so", "116:36", "they actually accentuated smaller", "116:38", "penises and their gods and smaller", "116:40", "penises in their statue and that's funny", "116:42", "I mean you can see these kinds of things", "116:44", "all the time so early pre Western", "116:46", "contact if you look at Japanese women", "116:48", "they're pinned they're painted with", "116:50", "their

they're", "117:33", "the creator of it and that's why we're", "117:34", "so obsessed with it women who say that", "117:36", "are playing games no that's ridiculous I", "117:40", "don't know that they are they're", "117:43", "definitely playing games", "117:44", "that's like men who are saying why are", "117:46", "women so obsessed with big breasts we", "117:48", "don't even care I've never had a guy who", "117:50", "said that there's some asshole out there", "117:53", "that's playing games okay possibly all", "117:55", "right yeah it's it is fascinating when", "117:59", "you think about all these different", "118:00", "things that lead to natural selection", "118:01", "and the fact that there's so many", "118:03", "variables that are in place and that", "118:06", "we're trying to find

there's a lot of blowback and a", "118:17", "lot of pushback yeah yes there will be", "118:18", "and and one of the interesting things", "118:20", "that we do know is if you think about", "118:21",

almost there and I", "124:24", "actually I think Pinker's got the best", "124:26", "answer to this question which is", "124:27", "basically well what structures do you", "124:29", "need to put in place to make the world a", "124:30", "safer and less violent place and and I", "124:33", "don't know if you've talked to him about", "124:34", "his book better angels of our nature I", "124:36",

cycles on", "124:51", "itself so when I was a little kid and", "124:53", "this kind of thing probably happened to", "124:54", "you I was on when I was in kindergarten", "124:56", "the guy who drove our carpool was a cop", "124:59", "so this cop is driving me home in the", "125:01", "back of his car now he's got no seat", "125:03", "belts cuz this is 1969 and cars don't", "125:05", "have seatbelts right big bench seat in a", "125:07", "Buick or something and we'd come around", "125:09", "a corner and they all slide up against", "125:11", "me to the edge of the car seat and I'm",

the car", "125:19", "oh man I go bouncing across the street", "125:21", "right so he's you know he's not gonna", "125:23", "ride home in two handed so of course he", "125:24", "goes and retrieves me from the ditch and", "125:26", "he brings me out and shows my mom and", "125:27", "I'm bleeding and bruised and torn shirt", "125:30", "and you know like you'd expect from", "125:31", "bouncing out of a car and my mom who's a", "125:33", "pediatrician so she could tell I wasn't", "125:35", "badly damaged looks at me and says ah he", "125:37", "looks fine don't worry about it can you", "125:39", "imagine somebody brought your kid home", "125:40", "said hey man really sorry Joe", "125:42", "your daughter fell out the car bounced", "125:43", "across the frickin street you had a", "125:45", "throttle them it'd be freaked out and", "125:47", "it's not that long ago either no this is", "125:49", "1969 when you and I are both on this", "125:51", "planet and so what I think is part of", "125:53", "what's what Pinker is documenting is as", "125:55", "the world gets safer we start getting", "125:57", "used to a low man", "125:59", "ham world yeah and and these these", "126:01", "mayhem events stand out in our mind and", "126:03", "so it actually self perpetuates where", "126:05", "the safer gets the safer we need it to", "126:07", "be because every little thing that goes", "126:08", "wrong stands out in sharper relief", "126:10", "that's a very fascinating way of looking", "126:13", "at it you know what's interesting to me", "126:16", "about Pinker's work is how much pushback", "126:18", "he gets and particularly about the world", "126:20", "being a safer place like people want to", "126:22", "keep putting pointing towards violent", "126:25", "episodes and-and-and and racism and and", "126:29", "crime and all these different things is", "126:31", "different factors as if it's some sort", "126:33", "of evidence against what he's saying", "126:34", "when he's incorporating that those", "126:36", "current events into this large database", "126:40", "and he's saying yes it's not that we", "126:43", "don't live in Utopia", "126:44", "right but the world is vastly safer and", "126:47", "better now than it was a thousand years", "126:49", "ago or ten thousand years ago or even a", "126:50", "hundred years ago or even thirty but why", "126:52", "is there so much pushback against it", "126:54", "well so the thing is I think what's", "126:55", "going on and so people worried that it", "126:57", "doesn't look like a problem to be solved", "126:59", "anymore right so when you want our kids", "127:01", "we both have lots of gay friends but we", "127:03", "didn't know it because they're not", "127:04", "telling anybody cuz someone's gonna kick", "127:05", "their ass if they knew that they were", "127:07", "gay now yes gay people are still", "127:09", "discriminated against but it's so much", "127:10", "better than it was then what you don't", "127:12", "wanna what I think people are advocates", "127:14", "don't want to say is well there's no", "127:15", "problem anymore because then you can", "127:17", "allow them to still run into troubles in", "127:19", "various circumstances even though the", "127:20", "trouble they run into today is a", "127:22", "thousand times less than the trouble", "127:24", "they ran to and right a little same", "127:25", "thing holds for racism same thing holds", "127:27", "for sexes and they've all gotten so much", "127:29", "better but and sexual violence is a", "127:32", "perfect example you know if you look at", "127:33", "if you said this is in Pinker's book a", "127:35", "few set rape and homicide - you call it", "127:38", "both of them whatever level they are in", "127:40", "1970 to a hundred and then you track", "127:42", "them through to the early 2000s homicide", "127:45", "in the u.s. homicides dropped down to", "127:47", "like 50 rapes dropped down to like 25", "127:49", "but if you listen to women's advocacy", "127:51", "groups about campus sexual assault and", "127:53", "stuff you'd never know that and the", "127:55", "reason you wouldn't know it is because", "127:56", "they people worry well if you think the", "127:59", "problems getting better on its own then", "128:00", "you won't keep doing anything to help", "128:02", "fix it and that's a really unfortunate", "128:04", "part of our psychology because it makes", "128:06", "people feel like there's been no", "128:07", "progress and when you feel like there's", "128:09", "no progress then you think well maybe we", "128:10", "need to completely overturn the whole", "128:11", "system and", "128:12", "something new and that's of course the", "128:14", "point of Pinker's newest book", "128:15", "enlightenment now know things are going", "128:17", "freaking great", "128:18", "turn it anarchy and all those things are", "128:20", "really bad ideas voting for somebody", "128:21", "like trumps a really bad idea because", "128:23", "things are actually running along really", "128:24", "nicely it's just that we tend to forget", "128:26", "it because every advocacy group who's", "128:29", "all worried about whatever their", "128:30", "particular issue is doesn't want the", "128:32", "word to get out that things are a lot", "128:33", "better than they used to be because I", "128:34", "think it's some fundamental level they", "128:36", "think well twenty five rapes here isn't", "128:38", "bad enough we better say that there's a", "128:39", "hundred you know I'm not saying they do", "128:41", "this consciously but of course twenty", "128:42", "five rapes here whatever the number is", "128:44", "is bad enough right it doesn't it", "128:46", "doesn't have to be the numbers that it", "128:48", "used to be when I was a child to be a", "128:49", "problem it all has to be is a number", "128:51", "above zero well there seems to the", "128:53", "people develop this vested interest in", "128:56", "promoting an idea and they want to", "128:59", "exaggerate that idea whatever it is", "129:01", "whether it's the idea that the world is", "129:02", "a safer place than it actually is or", "129:04",

"129:13", "thing we're married to we're married to", "129:15", "this concept of polyamorous life and", "129:17", "that this is a natural way to live or", "129:19", "that you know violence is inevitable and", "129:21", "then this is just a part of who we are", "129:22", "we tend to promote that and we tend to", "129:25", "have massive confirmation bias and it's", "129:27", "it's I think it's because we personally", "129:31", "associate ourselves with ideas we don't", "129:33", "look at ideas as being a thing like if", "129:36", "you think that something is one way and", "129:39",

"130:01", "mm-hm I've been wrong already on your", "130:03", "show right and so it's super hard to", "130:05", "admit because by human nature you just", "130:06", "want you wanna my immediate reactions to", "130:08", "fight against it and not to say well", "130:10", "hold on what's Jo saying you know he's", "130:12", "right I overstated that let's back off", "130:13", "right and so there's this really lovely", "130:15", "paper that came out in 2011 by Mercier", "130:18", "and Dan's Berber and what they argued is", "130:20", "I think they nailed it and they said", "130:22", "here's what it is our brain actually we", "130:24", "evolved our logical process", "130:26", "singing abilities not to find out the", "130:27", "truth of the world but to convince you", "130:29", "of my point of

"130:46", "is true then the world's gonna be a", "130:48", "little kinder to me it'll fit my", "130:50", "worldview and others will give me the", "130:51", "things I want and so I go through life", "130:53", "trying to persuade you of my worldview", "130:54", "rather than trying to find out what's", "130:56", "actually out there and so that's why you", "130:58", "think oh well smart people are gonna", "130:59", "fall for that no smart doesn't matter", "131:01", "how smart you are you you you're using", "131:03", "whatever brain power you have not to", "131:05", "define the truth but rather to find", "131:06", "evidence for your particular point of", "131:08", "view well I see I think it's also a", "131:10", "byproduct of ignorance because for the", "131:12", "longest time you could tell me something", "131:14", "and there was very little way that I", "131:15", "could find out whether or not you're", "131:17", "right or not", "131:17", "I really couldn't no you're correct", "131:20", "unless I went and started doing research", "131:22", "and read some books and whereas now I", "131:24", "could just pull up my phone and say hey", "131:27", "Bill just said this is that right and", "131:29", "then the phone will go no there's been a", "131:30", "hundred different Saturdays each other", "131:31", "and you go oh look motherfucker yeah I", "131:34", "got the stats that's true and that", "131:36", "definitely matters a lot it's it's the", "131:38", "this awesome democratization of", "131:40", "knowledge but if that really were all", "131:43", "that it was then everybody would agree", "131:45", "on their politics everybody would agree", "131:46", "that the fake news was fake and the real", "131:48", "news was real not necessarily because", "131:50", "this is a fairly recent invention but", "131:52", "what I'm getting at is that I think that", "131:53", "the ability to be deceptive was perhaps", "131:56", "there was an evolutionary advantage oh", "131:59", "absolutely yeah so that's one of the", "132:00", "very first things that happens when you", "132:02", "have theory of mind because as soon as I", "132:03", "realize the contents of your mind differ", "132:05",

goes yeah I got a grassman", "146:53", "and a leaf man lunchbox nobody he just", "146:57", "made the shit up right because spiders", "147:00", "right the Spider Man there's a grasp and", "147:02", "he's looking around for other things", "147:03", "right and so I was actually proud of him", "147:05", "because it showed a he's got theory mine", "147:07", "down he knows what the kid can and can't", "147:09", "know and B he knows that telling these", "147:11", "stories are gonna be important for his", "147:13", "place in the social hierarchy so the kid", "147:15", "looks at me and I'm like trying not to", "147:16", "laugh right cuz I got to support my son", "147:18", "and he's like really and I'm like damn", "147:20", "right kid and so you you can imagine", "147:25", "that it without this background you", "147:26", "might say look we should discourage this", "147:28", "kind of line right but it gives you a", "147:29", "little bit of a different perspective on", "147:31", "it's also probably weird because you you", "147:32", "know your kid realizes yeah my dad's got", "147:34", "my back well that's good thanks bro", "147:38", "exactly and then she'd always have your",

very fascinating to the", "148:02", "like the Hindus and all these different", "148:04", "different tribes and different cultures", "148:07", "that worshipped cattle where other", "148:09", "people just thought of them as food", "148:10", "sources right and so again now I don't", "148:12", "know the origins that", "148:13", "you can imagine a system whereby well if", "148:15", "you keep cattle and you benefit from", "148:17", "them rather than eating them you're", "148:18", "gonna get some gains from that and we do", "148:20", "know when you shift from being on", "148:21", "together to basically kill in and eat", "148:23", "and stuff to being a pastoralist so", "148:25", "you're you have cattle or sheep or", "148:26", "whatever or to being a farmer you", "148:29", "suddenly have to

worry about tomorrow when it comes", "148:45", "along well once you shift to having", "148:47", "herds or having land you can't that", "148:49", "psychology doesn't work anymore and so", "148:51", "what's super interesting is it took", "148:52", "literally like 10 or 20,000 years we've", "148:55", "got the implements in place to be", "148:57", "agricultural as but we're not planting", "148:59", "and it just were just grinding stuff", "149:01", "that we gather and why did it take so", "149:02", "long to plant well maybe it was weather", "149:04", "maybe it was a bunch of things but part", "149:05", "of is you have to shift your psychology", "149:07", "over and say all right I got to stop", "149:08", "thinking about eating killin a nyan it", "149:11", "today I got to say well all right well", "149:12", "would it be beneficial to me to keep", "149:14", "this beast around and have it for", "149:17", "tomorrow and drink its blood or its milk", "149:18", "or whatever and one way to get there", "149:20", "might have been well let's let's create", "149:22", "a religion that says we can't eat them", "149:23", "today because that'll solve it", "149:24", "immediately right that's one way to look", "149:27", "at it but have you ever looked into some", "149:28", "of the other hypothesis on the origin of", "149:31", "cattle worship I think it again has to", "149:34", "do with psilocybin because they know", "149:35", "that could be totally cool right growing", "149:37", "cow shit and that'd be totally cool and", "149:39", "not only that but it would because it", "149:40", "has benefits so like societies can do", "149:42", "anything they want right and there's", "149:43", "some crazy systems that they do and a", "149:45", "lot of those are really bad ideas", "149:46", "they're sources of infection and disease", "149:48", "and death and those societies tend not", "149:50", "to grow but societies that do things", "149:52", "that happen to be good ideas even if", "149:54", "they got it from mushrooms and things", "149:55", "like that", "149:56", "those are gonna really pass along and so", "149:58", "you got a lot of people on this planet", "150:00", "to worship cows which suggests that", "150:01", "whatever got that started actually", "150:03", "probably had a benefit because those", "150:05", "societies grew and because worshipping", "150:07", "cows not something like when you come to", "150:08", "me and say man I worship cows and I'm", "150:10", "thinking okay I'd rather eat them but", "150:13", "fine right it's hard to imagine being", "150:15",

to you in in writing this", "150:37", "book and researching it and putting it", "150:39", "together was there anything that really", "150:40", "just had made you step back and go wow I", "150:44", "didn't see that one coming", "150:45", "look there's a lot of things that I", "150:47", "didn't see coming and a lot of times", "150:48", "where I thought I had an idea of how it", "150:50", "all worked and then I thought I would", "150:51", "read a lot of more papers and I go", "150:53", "that's not even possible they didn't", "150:54", "have that capability or whatever what", "150:56", "what surprised me was that I a big part", "150:59", "of the where this book comes from is", "151:00", "that then colleagues would say they", "151:02", "would know I'm working on this and", "151:03", "they'd say well come give a talk at my", "151:04", "conference on leadership and I'd say", "151:06", "well I don't know anything about", "151:07", "leadership well surely something it must", "151:09", "have implications for that and every", "151:11", "time they ask me to do that you know I'd", "151:13", "say okay I'll give it a try and then", "151:15", "literally you sit down and think about", "151:17", "it you guys wow there are important", "151:18", "implications for leadership or", "151:19", "innovation or happiness or sociality and", "151:22", "I never saw them coming and so as", "151:24", "literally friends of mine kind of forced", "151:25", "I had one goal which is just understand", "151:27", "social intelligence and how did we", "151:29", "become so socially intelligent and the", "151:32", "and that was where I started and friends", "151:34", "just kept asking me to look at other", "151:36", "things and every time I did there was an", "151:37", "answer sometimes there was an answer", "151:39", "that's easier to find and it's harder to", "151:40", "find but it was always there and what", "151:42", "that tells me is that there's really a", "151:44", "lot of value and taking the anthropology", "151:47", "in the biology and putting them together", "151:48", "and saying alright where do we come from", "151:49", "and now what can that tell us about who", "151:51", "we are today", "151:52", "that's an interesting stuff like sort of", "151:55", "a intellectual exercise to write a", "151:57", "different perspective on the material", "151:59", "that you're going over is somebody", "152:01", "forces you into a little box like tell", "152:04", "me you know what what happened you know", "152:06", "what's the influence on or what the", "152:08", "impact on creativity yeah what's the", "152:10", "impact on leadership or all these", "152:11", "different yeah yeah yeah just to give", "152:13", "you a different view let's look at it", "152:15", "from the left let's look at it from the", "152:16", "top from below and now it's so fun about", "152:18", "Sciences you could say all right well", "152:20", "let's see if it tells us anything that", "152:22", "either we already know is true and now", "152:23", "we could get new things that we would", "152:25", "know about it or if it tells us", "152:26", "something that we don't even know but", "152:27", "that might explain the way the world is", "152:29", "and both of those are valuable because", "152:31", "then you can run off and try to test", "152:32", "them and a lot of dead ends I mean", "152:34", "that's what science is all about but", "152:35", "some of them will hopefully not be dead", "152:37", "ends and you'll run off and test and say", "152:38", "holy shit now", "152:39", "understand innovation now I understand", "152:41", "whatever what's interesting about this", "152:43", "kind of material is that it gives you", "152:44", "did me as a individual gives me insight", "152:48", "in my own behavior and I think it would", "152:51", "do a lot of people do all of us some", "152:55", "real good if we had a better", "152:57", "understanding of what our motivations", "152:59", "are and how we got to this point in", "153:01", "civilization what we actually are you", "153:03", "know I mean maybe a will or won't change", "153:05", "your behavior but at least it'll give", "153:07", "you some insight into oh I totally agree", "153:09", "and the thing is that when I find myself", "153:11", "getting upset because you disagree with", "153:13", "me about something trivial or even", "153:15", "important like politics or something and", "153:17", "it takes a second you gotta stop say", "153:19", "hold on I don't have any privileged", "153:20", "access to the right way to do things", "153:22", "right and so the fact that you care more", "153:24", "about X and I care more about why", "153:25", "doesn't mean that you're like an evil", "153:27", "person and must be overcome it means", "153:29", "that probably we ought to be talking to", "153:31", "each other and trying to find a", "153:32", "compromise solution that makes things", "153:34", "work best but there's this automatic", "153:36", "incident I think that you are evil", "153:37", "absolutely and so the beauty of this", "153:39", "kind of more you know about this stuff", "153:41", "in the past and our evolution our", "153:42", "origins the more you know that literally", "153:44", "we've evolved to do that because if we", "153:45", "didn't do that we're screwed but now we", "153:47", "don't need to anymore and so now we can", "153:49", "say well hold on I'm a lefty and you're", "153:51", "you know in my example you're a righty", "153:54", "and we disagree about this particular", "153:55", "president but a fine", "153:56", "let's see if we can both agree on a goal", "153:58", "that will make both of us happy rather", "154:00", "than oh you're evil and all I have to do", "154:01", "is overcome you one of the things that", "154:03", "I've really tried very hard from doing", "154:06", "this podcast is to not be attached ideas", "154:08", "and to do that as an exercise and I", "154:10", "think over the course of the years I've", "154:11", "been doing this I've gotten way way", "154:13", "better at that but it's it's just so", "154:16", "fascinating when I encounter in the raw", "154:18", "form like when I go to a party and I", "154:20", "just run into some guy was a dad and he", "154:22", "brings something up and I tell mom it's", "154:24", "not totally true because of this and", "154:26", "then you see this like the blood starts", "154:28", "yeah pumping and the heart starts", "154:30", "beating and they're trying to look at", "154:31", "some way you're wrong and you know it", "154:33", "becomes a personal thing it gets very", "154:36", "very heated and it's easy for all of us", "154:38", "to do that and my job and your job is", "154:40", "the same it's to say okay is it time to", "154:42", "abandon this ideas or time to defend", "154:44", "yeah and when I was young in an academic", "154:46", "there was no way I was abandoning that", "154:48", "was lost all I was gonna do was defend", "154:50", "so you attacked me and I Marshall", "154:52", "everything I can and I", "154:52", "to attack you back and it was some of my", "154:54", "colleagues are like hey man you know", "154:56", "it's when you're wrong it's cool that's", "154:58", "what science is and I'm like ah you're", "155:00", "right you're right I've got it started", "155:01", "and so now even though I love the", "155:03", "give-and-take of academics and I love to", "155:05", "argue about stuff I try really really", "155:06", "hard to keep in my mind well what if", "155:09", "what you're saying right now is right", "155:10", "rather than trying to just attack it", "155:11", "which is my automatic instinct to say", "155:13", "well what of what of it that you're", "155:15", "saying now might be a value that I", "155:17", "should actually be incorporating and not", "155:18", "trying to stomp on yeah and also just", "155:21", "the ideas aren't you exactly you're you", "155:24", "and these ideas are just something that", "155:25", "you're tossing around like a beach ball", "155:26", "yeah exactly right and that's super hard", "155:28", "to keep in mind because everything that", "155:30", "we come to own we get attached to and if", "155:33", "I tend to have my ideas because they", "155:35", "tend to make the world a more hospitable", "155:37", "place to bill then in a way I kind of do", "155:39", "need to defend them because if you", "155:41", "convince me know the way the world", "155:42", "should work is whoever is strongest gets", "155:44", "everything well I'm stuffed and so I", "155:46", "need to try to fight against a lot of", "155:48", "alternative views and and I have to", "155:50", "overcome that in my effort to define", "155:52", "what the right answer is as well so it's", "155:54", "good makes good sense that our ideas of", "155:55", "like possessions that we have attitudes", "155:57", "toward our ideas just like we have", "155:58", "toward the objects that we own that", "156:00", "means something to us to our family to", "156:01", "our group etc that all makes really good", "156:03", "sense and and the other side of that", "156:05", "coin is if we talking about the way", "156:07", "things used to be in a pre-medical world", "156:10", "if you're the chances of you carrying", "156:12", "different pathogens and I carry is", "156:14", "reasonably high and if you infect me I'm", "156:16", "screwed now if you do things differently", "156:18", "than I do things so you eat this food", "156:20", "and I eat that food well it different", "156:22", "could actually be wrong from my", "156:24", "perspective because if I do what you've", "156:25", "done I might get myself sick because", "156:27", "you've adapted to that that thing and so", "156:29", "we literally probably for good", "156:31", "evolutionary reasons came to view", "156:33", "cultural ways of doing things that are", "156:34", "different as if they're wrong because", "156:36", "that saved us that protected us from the", "156:38", "kind of pathogen vectors that you've", "156:39", "gotten adapted to but that I haven't", "156:41", "that's fascinating so that this is", "156:43", "almost like ingrained in us yeah well", "156:46", "it's we've evolved to be this way", "156:47", "and so it's hard to undo that do you", "156:50", "think that with the access to", "156:52", "information that we're currently", "156:53", "enjoying that because there's so much", "156:57", "information now and it's so easy to get", "156:58", "to that perhaps there'll be more", "157:01", "instances of people not becoming", "157:04", "attached to their ideas and recognizing", "157:06", "that they are", "157:06", "there they are separate the you are just", "157:08", "a thinking organism and what the facts", "157:11", "are and what reality is is just", "157:13", "something that's happening and you don't", "157:15", "have to be personally attached to it", "157:17", "it's not a part of your identity yeah I", "157:19", "hope so because in an ideal world we", "157:21", "could have the things that were attached", "157:22", "to that don't really matter I'm an", "157:24", "iPhone guy and you're an Android right", "157:26", "who cares right we could argue about it", "157:27", "and be silly and exactly exactly we", "157:30", "could still be friends and all that and", "157:31", "then we could when there's something", "157:33", "that mattered and know this this", "157:35", "political strategy will make everyone", "157:37", "poorer or sicker or whatever then we", "157:39", "could be willing to change their minds", "157:40", "because in the end I think we've got", "157:42", "this evolved desire to latch onto these", "157:44", "things these ideas and values and and", "157:48", "products even and I all that and so it'd", "157:51", "be nice if we could do it with the", "157:53", "trivial and let the stuff that really", "157:54", "matters guide our us by its accuracy", "157:57", "well it'd be also nice if that the stuff", "157:59", "that we do with trivial it stays", "158:00", "actually trivial yeah because there's so", "158:02", "many people and well I guess it goes", "158:04", "with sports teams and but it also goes", "158:07", "with like brands of cars like I've heard", "158:10", "people say I've always been a Ford guy I", "158:11", "love for it's like okay yeah I probably", "158:14", "remind you the Ford your dad drove or", "158:15", "whatever I guess but it's like I would", "158:18", "never buy a Chevy alright okay look", "158:20", "really never it's funny is like what if", "158:23", "the best fucking car was a Chevy and you", "158:25", "have the opportunity to buy like no no", "158:27", "I'm a Ford guy like right wait what", "158:29", "benefit would some strange reason this", "158:32", "there's some weird motivation to stick", "158:35", "to your initial statements yeah so I", "158:37", "think it's like all our Wendell Holmes", "158:39", "or someone who's had a foolish", "158:40", "consistency is the hobgoblin to small", "158:42", "minds right but we all have these", "158:44", "consistencies ass because part of the", "158:46", "problem is if I move around with the", "158:47", "wind you look at me as I'm a nothing", "158:49", "right I can't stand flop if I can't", "158:51", "stand by what I believe in then you have", "158:53", "no respect for me but what if you boot", "158:55", "what if you what you believe in is", "158:57", "incorrect", "158:58", "right that's that's my Psicosis probably", "159:00", "into that right and so that's that's", "159:02", "where it gets real right and so what you", "159:04", "obviously would you ideally want it's", "159:05", "here's my value structure and it's", "159:07", "unchangeable and then negotiable yes and", "159:09", "yet when you show me that I'm in that my", "159:11", "attitudes are impeding my own goals then", "159:13", "I'm willing to change them to achieve", "159:15", "that value structure and and I think the", "159:17", "best politicians and scientists and", "159:19", "artists", "159:20", "and comedians and all the rest are the", "159:21", "ones who can do that yeah well I like", "159:23", "what you said like here's my value", "159:25", "structure this is these are my ethics", "159:27", "these are my morals this is how I treat", "159:29", "people this is who I am but all that", "159:31", "other stuff is just information yeah", "159:33", "it's all means to an end and so some", "159:35", "people care a lot about loyalty other", "159:37", "people care a lot about fairness other", "159:39", "people care a lot about sanctity and", "159:41", "purity right there's different values", "159:43", "that are important all of the world we", "159:44", "all care about them but some people wait", "159:46", "one set more important more than another", "159:48", "set yeah John Hyde if you I don't know", "159:49", "if you've had him on your show he does", "159:51", "this work and he's one of the first", "159:53", "people to push these ideas and you can", "159:55", "predict them by people's politics and", "159:56", "stuff like that and so if we all agree", "159:59", "they all matter but the problem is then", "160:01", "we get into an argument where you tell", "160:02", "me loyalty is more important than I tell", "160:04", "you fairness or harm is more important", "160:06", "and then we're never gonna see eye to", "160:08", "eye you know with two humans that are", "160:12", "healthy that's an interesting discussion",

I", "160:21", "think that when someone clings to this", "160:24", "idea that this is the most significant", "160:26", "aspect of human civilization that's", "160:28", "always weird yeah and it's hard

at that in in", "161:56", "rats for example will under feed the", "161:58", "mother when the baby's in there and that", "162:00", "causes the babies methylation of some of", "162:03", "the genes I

that is then when", "165:17", "people's diets move around you say oh", "165:19", "look this diet is this effect and that", "165:21", "one doesn't but you don't actually know", "165:22", "what they've

argument that we actually", "166:32", "evolved to have a tolerance for beer", "166:35", "rather than a distaste for it because", "166:37", "once we're in early agricultural", "166:39", "settlements for the first time ever were", "166:40", "crapping where we're drinking we're not", "166:42", "moving on", "166:43", "and so we foul our own drinking water so", "166:45", "beers literally safer to

"167:00", "can't be a good idea also if you think", "167:02", "about wine or any booze the first time", "167:06", "you drink it it's disgust yeah yeah it's", "167:07", "hard to develop a taste for it's exactly", "167:10", "right and so and lots of things that", "167:11", "that way Tabasco you know lots of these", "167:13", "spices have antibacterial effects yeah", "167:15", "and so the mothers are giving it to the", "167:16", "kids we're like on my mouth to be on", "167:18", "fire if I ate with some six-year-old", "167:19", "Candide in India or something wasn't", "167:20", "that initially why they added wasabi to", "167:23", "sushi that's what a lot of people argue", "167:24", "and in fact as you work your way from", "167:26", "the poles to the equator you get more", "167:28", "and more spices because of course in", "167:29", "Sweden there's six pathogens and you got", "167:31", "salt and pepper and in jungle and then", "167:34", "Africa you have a gazillion spices to do", "167:36", "garlic all these things are super", "167:37", "powerful antibacterials wow that is a", "167:40", "really interesting way of looking at it", "167:41", "yeah I'm sure right", "167:43", "like Mexico very high in spicy food warm", "167:46", "climate totally makes sense exactly and", "167:50", "the same thing happens we've found the", "167:51", "profusion of religions and languages the", "167:54", "closer you get to the equator the more", "167:55", "right languages you have and the more", "167:56", "religions you have because people start", "167:57", "saying you know on the other side of the", "167:59", "valley literally you could have a", "168:00", "pathogen that makes me sick and so I'm", "168:02", "gonna stay away from you and by staying", "168:03", "away from you over time we develop", "168:05", "different languages different religions", "168:06", "again back to Sweden whatever you got I", "168:08", "got there's three things to have right", "168:10", "and so you're not a risk to me and we", "168:12", "share the same language we intermingle", "168:13", "much more readily and there's more", "168:15", "ethnocentrism as you go close to the", "168:16", "equator Wow to keep and keeping apart", "168:20", "makes good evolutionary sense under", "168:21", "those circumstances but we live in a", "168:23", "world where no one's keeping apart exact", "168:25", "now we live in a world where it makes it", "168:26", "much much more difficult and you don't", "168:28", "necessarily stay in our in our blessed", "168:30", "industrialized democracies where we've", "168:31", "got good medicines at least for now they", "168:33", "still work you don't need to anymore", "168:35", "right but we also have these crazy", "168:38", "factory farming setups that lead to the", "168:41", "kind of horrible superbugs that can kill", "168:45", "a million handle yeah we do it I", "168:47", "remember when I first found that out", "168:48", "that most of the major flus like avian", "168:51", "flu swine flu I didn't know why they", "168:54", "were calling it the swine flu yeah and", "168:55", "then I found out no it's from", "168:56", "domesticated pigs and it's somehow", "168:58", "morphed and jumps to humans like why and", "169:01", "that was the cost we paid with", "169:03", "agriculture so the first time we were", "169:04", "starting to get we are cheek by jowl", "169:06", "with a bunch of animals and agriculture", "169:08", "I'm gonna have to gathers eat them they", "169:09", "the animal never lives long enough to", "169:11", "give you the flu right Wow so everything", "169:14", "you know there's always pluses and", "169:15", "minuses when you change how you do", "169:17", "things and we you and I are really lucky", "169:20", "we live in a time where all these great", "169:21", "medicines exist and they haven't become", "169:23", "worthless yet and now it's really a race", "169:25", "against the if all evolution of the", "169:28", "bacteria and us devising new medicines", "169:30", "that can continue to defeat them because", "169:32", "everything is becoming treatment", "169:33", "resistant right that's how evolution", "169:35", "works and and that's just starting to", "169:37", "happen and so now scientists have to", "169:39", "work double time to keep inventing new", "169:40", "drugs to stay ahead of the game with the", "169:42", "exception of some things that just for", "169:44", "whatever reason bacteria don't seem to", "169:46", "be all of all resistances to them", "169:48", "well what's fascinating to me is not", "169:49", "just scientists creating these vaccines", "169:51", "and all these different medicines to", "169:53", "deal with these diseases but the", "169:55", "potential of shutting off genes the", "169:58", "potential of altering the human genome", "170:00", "and using things like whatever the the", "170:03", "future version of CRISPR is going to be", "170:05", "to I mean they've already figured out a", "170:07", "way to stop certain diseases right so", "170:10", "those single gene things are great yeah", "170:12", "remember with everything being so", "170:14", "polygenic you don't just want to shut", "170:15", "shit down willy-nilly right and so then", "170:17", "really what you're at the advantage is", "170:19", "the point you made earlier so my diet", "170:21", "should be 60% protein in your should be", "170:23", "15", "170:24", "percent or mine should have more leafy", "170:26", "vegetables than yours whatever and we'll", "170:28", "be able to know that well know how my", "170:29", "guts gonna respond to it and how you're", "170:31", "gonna respond to it well that's one of", "170:33", "the things that 23andme actually does", "170:35", "they do they do show like what foods", "170:37", "you'd be more likely to be allergic to", "170:40", "and what things might be most likely to", "170:42", "be directed and that's a great start but", "170:43", "what we really need is to polygenic", "170:44", "scores to tell you how do you process", "170:46", "leafy vegetables how do you process fats", "170:48", "how do you process all that stuff yeah", "170:50", "and so because you know genes account", "170:52", "for most of our weight that's most of", "170:54", "the variance in our weather or obese or", "170:56", "not but nobody was obese when you and I", "170:59", "were kids", "170:59", "Brian tons of people are obese now so", "171:02", "what those genes really are is genes to", "171:04", "sensitivity to something change in our", "171:06", "environment either activity levels of", "171:07", "the foods reading or how process they", "171:09", "are or how much carbs or whatever we", "171:11", "don't know but that's what we're", "171:12", "actually genetically sensitive to", "171:14", "because all of us have the same", "171:15", "underlying problem that evolution didn't", "171:18", "really worry about obesity because the", "171:19", "problem was the opposite starving yeah", "171:21", "and so we're not really good at telling", "171:22", "when we're full and there's interesting", "171:24", "evidence that suggests some really", "171:25", "lovely studies that show that really one", "171:27", "of the key guides of appetite was", "171:29", "variety when you eat a lot less variety", "171:31", "your that's when your stomach tells you", "171:33", "you're full really much more reliably", "171:34", "but as you add variety to your diet", "171:36", "which everybody on earth can do now well", "171:38", "everybody's got any money on earth can", "171:39", "do now that actually you you", "171:41", "short-circuit the best mechanism we had", "171:43", "to tell us to stop eating yeah that's", "171:45", "interesting and now is an argument that", "171:47", "people who are experts on nutrition are", "171:50", "making about one of the more recent diet", "171:53", "plans that people using the carnivore", "171:55", "diet is that just eating only meat and", "171:59", "there's a lot of people that are doing", "172:00", "that and they're finding that they're", "172:02", "having all these like really rapid", "172:05", "decreases in autoimmune diseases and", "172:07",

"172:19", "great for him and some nutrition experts", "172:22", "saying more likely this is a calorie", "172:26", "like you're at a calorie deficit right", "172:29", "and by putting your body into a calorie", "172:31", "deficit you're almost like in a state of", "172:33", "fasting and you're decreasing your body", "172:35", "weight because almost universally all", "172:36", "these people that are there", "172:38", "talking about the positive benefits of", "172:40", "these diets these elimination diets and", "172:42", "just eating one thing one of the things", "172:44", "that they're showing is they lose a", "172:45", "shitload of weight right and so the", "172:47", "thing is that I suspect you right that", "172:48", "either they're cutting out what for them", "172:49", "is the perpetrator and who would ever", "172:51", "know out of the 4,000 things right or", "172:53", "it's literally the losing weight and", "172:55", "then hopefully they're taking", "172:56", "multivitamins to make up for all the", "172:57", "stuff that they're not getting right", "172:59", "yeah I don't think they are a lot of", "173:01", "them are not doing that it's really", "173:03", "interesting I've been following it", "173:05", "pretty closely and I've had quite a few", "173:06", "people in the podcast including really", "173:08", "intelligent guys like Jordan Peterson is", "173:10", "on this and

green", "173:20", "vegetable I know I should but I don't", "173:21", "like them so I yeah I edible oh I know I", "173:28", "should so I my my wife makes them and", "173:30", "I'll eat a little bit of it but like a", "173:31", "little kid yeah I know I know but in my", "173:33", "way it's like no I know and your 8 year", "173:37", "olds right now by the way it turns out", "173:39", "there are genes that make people find", "173:40", "broccoli more disgusting and and more at", "173:42", "a more bitter versus less bitter so some", "173:44", "people really have their tongue says no", "173:46",

have time for lunch and literally", "174:27", "they all eat it again and so what's", "174:29", "what's amazing about these studies is", "174:31", "then this follow-up study what they did", "174:32",
