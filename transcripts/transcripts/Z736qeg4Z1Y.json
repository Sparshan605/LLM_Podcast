Conor fight a", "34:00", "lot of people thought that Conor cut too", "34:01", "much weight that's one of the reasons", "34:03", "why I burnt out yeah that's part of it I", "34:06", "think it was a factor he does cut a lot", "34:08", "of weight and that does drain your body", "34:10", "and it's not like when he's training", "34:12", "he's cutting that weight because he's", "34:13", "not you know like you only do it once", "34:16", "you do it right before the weigh-ins you", "34:18", "get you weigh in and then you put the", "34:19", "weight back on so all that endurance", "34:21", "training all those hard rounds that you", "34:23", "did", "34:23", "that's not after your dehydrating", "34:27", "yourself severely so your body's not", "34:29", "used to operating exactly that level", "34:31", "with this situation now well he's used", "34:35", "to it because he fights an MMA like that", "34:36", "but MMA you get more chances to take a", "34:39", "break you get it's it's different you", "34:41", "know it's more exhausting like it could", "34:43", "potentially be more exhausting because", "34:45", "there's grappling and there's kicks and", "34:47", "there's just a lot more going on and", "34:49", "you're fighting five-minute rounds like", "34:50", "you have more of a chance to get tired", "34:52", "and that five-minute rounds but when you", "34:54", "clinch with someone you could actually", "34:56", "hold on to them like referees not going", "34:58", "to break it you can take them to the", "34:59", "ground and get on top of them you can", "35:01", "hold your position and catch your breath", "35:03", "there's there's more opportunities to", "35:05", "recover", "35:06", "right now weight cutting is the worst", "35:08", "part of fighting 100% seems it was even", "35:12", "the fighter that uh Janissa was supposed", "35:17", "to fight that day she took a picture of", "35:20", "herself and she may wait but it looked", "35:25", "terrible like it was definitely 105 now", "35:28", "that I remember cuz 115 wouldn't look", "35:30", "crazy like it was she's like I made way", "35:37", "now like yo you okay it was like you", "35:44", "know what she tried she tried to make",

that", "35:56", "you went to then they come in at an", "35:58", "advantage yeah you have an advantage if", "36:00", "you're not dehydrating yourself as much", "36:01", "but that advantage is crazy like they", "36:03", "should stop doing that they really", "36:05", "should figure out a way to stop fighters", "36:06", "from cutting weight like that what's the", "36:08", "alternative the alternative is to weigh", "36:10", "them like randomly the same way they", "36:12", "catch people with drugs like we went", "36:13", "you're like random drug tests do random", "36:16", "weight tests
