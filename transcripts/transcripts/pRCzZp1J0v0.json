saying and one of them I", "10:13", "fully agree with the implication what", "10:16", "you just said is that less funding isn't", "10:18", "the solution if anything more funding is", "10:20", "so that we get better qualified people", "10:22", "better training trained them right we", "10:24", "get people who are better suited to the", "10:25", "job in the first place and then we train", "10:27",

little to do", "13:52", "with modern racism but what it has to do", "13:54", "with is a property of our system so you", "13:59", "know there's a cybernetic principle the", "14:02", "purpose of a system is what it does it", "14:05", "means that don't listen to what somebody", "14:07", "says that the system is for look at what", "14:09", "it accomplishes that's what it's for and", "14:11", "our system basically has two things that", "14:14", "it accomplishes it basically keeps real", "14:20", "change from happening and the reason it", "14:22", "keeps real change from happening is", "14:23", "because people who are winning in the", "14:25", "present system will continue to win if", "14:28", "the system continues to do what it does", "14:29", "and they may lose if the system changes",

threatens", "14:41", "them and the other thing that our system", "14:43", "does is it reproduces present patterns", "14:48", "of distribution into the future and what", "14:51", "that means is racism that has almost", "14:53", "died out is still alive and well in a", "14:56", "sense", "14:56", "because all you have to do is take", "14:58", "people who are born into a neighborhood", "15:00", "that is devoid of opportunity and", "15:03", "continue that pattern if no opportunity", "15:06", "shows up then people who were oppressed", "15:07", "are now going to continue to be", "15:09", "oppressed and so it feels personal but", "15:11", "it isn't it's just reproducing an", "15:13", "existing pattern and a lot of that", "15:17", "emanates from these communities that", "15:19", "have been disenfranchised and", "15:21", "economically distraught from slavery", "15:25", "like literally from that where we're", "15:27", "dealing with the echoes of slavery and", "15:29", "it doesn't get

"15:39", "of that are still alive today in the", "15:42", "South they're still alive today in many", "15:44", "communities that were redlined as", "15:46", "recently as the 1960s right that's", "15:49", "exactly right", "15:49", "and so it we basically have set", "15:52", "ourselves up for a confused response", "15:55", "because there is a subtlety the fact", "15:58", "that ancient races and people who are", "16:00", "dead their racism still haunts us today", "16:03", "through mechanisms of the reproduction", "16:05", "of patterns of distribution and mind you", "16:07", "and people here distribution they freak", "16:09", "out because they think you're talking", "16:10", "about wealth I'm not talking about", "16:12", "wealth and we can talk about why I", "16:14", "wouldn't bother but what we're talking", "16:16", "about is opportunity opportunity has", "16:19", "been hoarded it has been concentrated in", "16:21", "some zip codes and almost totally", "16:23", "excluded from other zip codes", "16:25", "and so you're right the patterns of", "16:29", "slavery moved into Jim Crow and now", "16:31", "they've moved into a phase where they", "16:33", "are very subtly infused in into our", "16:36", "system and so it is causing people to", "16:39", "have the sense that there is an enemy", "16:41", "and it is out to get me when it's not", "16:43", "exactly an enemy that's out to get you", "16:45", "it's a pattern right it's a pattern that", "16:47", "definitely needs to be addressed and so", "16:49", "the natural place would have been the", "16:51", "Democratic Party but the Democratic", "16:54", "Party because it has taken up with big", "16:56", "business is not going to do it even", "16:58", "though it would be a winning political", "17:00", "strategy the Democratic

is", "60:54", "a crime yes okay presumably there was a", "60:58", "lot of complaint about the fact that", "60:59", "Chauvin wasn't charged with first-degree", "61:01", "murder", "61:01", "right but he

us that it was", "62:01", "murder", "62:01", "why is that okay so there are several", "62:05", "things about what we saw what we didn't", "62:09", "see but now know and things that are", "62:11",

weren't the case that", "62:50", "he was having a heart attack", "62:51", "you mean same system is it was it just", "62:53", "because he tested positive for it or was", "62:56", "it active in his

leave it so again I am", "63:17", "NOT rooting I understand what you saw", "63:19", "him to be the reason why I bring that up", "63:21", "is coming from someone who works very", "63:23", "closely with

he murder him by leaning on his neck", "70:05", "for eight minutes and 46 seconds or did", "70:07", "he not I would say did he not is so", "70:10", "small you would have to have a fucking", "70:12",

right", "71:11", "okay I hope this is clear but in", "71:16", "exchange for that I want the agreement", "71:18", "that the American thing to do is to", "71:21", "convict him by the evidence in a

of justice what I don't know", "71:59", "and what I don't think any of us", "72:00", "understand is what is the policy did he", "72:04", "exceed the policy did he enact the", "72:06", "policy I just

all for that but then when", "72:31", "you're done when you got him cuffed let", "72:32", "him go there's not a threat that guy", "72:34", "wasn't even moving I want to be begging", "72:36", "for his

the need to emphasize I do", "73:46", "believe I saw a miscarriage of justice", "73:48", "but I know that the American thing to do", "73:50", "is to have all of this out in a court of", "73:54", "law where all of the appropriate", "73:55", "arguments are on the table I agree with", "73:57", "you I don't I don't see a way where he", "74:02", "wasn't guilty but I do agree with you", "74:05", "that he should be tried in a court of", "74:07", "law but but it's based on that I say", "74:09", "he's guilty and then we're also looking", "74:11", "at the comparison between the Eric", "74:13", "Gardner

now they sort of co-opted their", "94:25", "ideology to fit his needs yeah but it's", "94:29", "not a solution right so we have to get", "94:32", "that solution which means we have to get", "94:33", "by the parties Trump proved that was", "94:35", "possible right I think if there's any of", "94:38", "it there was ever a time where an", "94:40", "independent party has a chance now is", "94:41", "the time if someone steps in and has a", "94:44", "real solution and also for in terms of", "94:48", "the distribution of that information", "94:49", "now's the time because you could just", "94:51", "post something on YouTube where you're", "94:54", "demonstrating like through a", "94:56", "step-by-step process you could take", "94:57", "hours to do it like this is what I want", "94:59", "to do and this is how I'm gonna do it", "95:00", "you break those down the clips almost", "95:02", "like a podcast and if someone was a", "95:04", "person of substance that we really", "95:07", "believed in we said that person can", "95:10", "really do this this actually could", "95:11", "happen let's vote independent it could", "95:14", "happen they don't have a monopoly on the", "95:17", "distribution of information anymore and", "95:19", "that's terrifying to them because they", "95:20", "used to be able to count on the shells", "95:22", "on the left and the right to get the", "95:24", "word out for them but they don't have", "95:26", "that anymore you have so many people", "95:29", "that", "95:30", "really don't have an ideological", "95:32", "foundation in either one of them that", "95:35", "are talking and they're reaching", "95:36", "millions of people that's a rare moment", "95:38", "in time and this is in my opinion the", "95:41", "very best time for someone to step in", "95:43", "that's not they're not compliant they're", "95:47", "not they don't have to give it they", "95:48", "don't they don't need that policy", "95:51", "machine behind them or the political", "95:53", "machine behind them well I've got a plan", "95:55", "okay but we would have to find a really", "95:57", "big podcast I think to get enough", "95:59", "momentum see none of those out there you", "96:00", "haven't encountered a big part you know", "96:01", "they don't exist all right you want to", "96:04", "hear the plan sure okay the rock and", "96:06", "jock were willing well you know let's", "96:10", "put that okay let's put that to the side", "96:12", "it's not part of the plan but it", "96:14", "actually could fit okay so here's the", "96:17", "the plan this plan needs a better name", "96:19", "but the working title is the Dark Horse", "96:22", "duo plan and the plan looks like this we", "96:26", "draft two individuals we find two people", "96:31", "one of them is center-left", "96:32", "and one of them is center-right and", "96:35", "these people have to have certain", "96:37", "characteristics a minimum set they have", "96:39", "to be patriotic they have to be", "96:42", "courageous and they have to be highly", "96:45", "capable right but that's it", "96:47", "okay center-left in a center right and", "96:49", "we pair them together and we draft them", "96:53", "with the following plan that they will", "96:57", "govern as a team that is to say every", "97:00", "important decision will be discussed and", "97:03", "they will decide what to do as a team", "97:06", "and only in cases where they cannot", "97:09", "reach agreement or whether something has", "97:11", "to be whenever something has to be", "97:12", "decided on a very short timescale like a", "97:14", "military decision does the person who", "97:17", "inhabits the role of the president", "97:19", "govern alone okay we draft these folks", "97:23", "and then four years down the road they", "97:27", "switch and the one who had run for", "97:29", "president now runs for the vice", "97:31", "presidential spot and the one who was", "97:33", "vice president now runs for president", "97:34", "and they continued this way until one of", "97:36", "two things happens either we vote", "97:39", "someone else in or one of them has", "97:41", "inhabited the office of president twice", "97:43", "and is no longer", "97:43", "and then that person has to be replaced", "97:46", "so we have a patriotic team governing", "97:49", "together from center left and center", "97:52", "right well you say drafted that's the", "97:54", "problem like someone has to be motivated", "97:56", "to ruin their fucking lives to try to", "97:58", "run this country that's what happens to", "98:00", "everybody that does it I agree but then", "98:02", "that's an obstacle you're spelling out", "98:04", "or an obstacle that I would argue is", "98:06", "solvable that we know these people who", "98:07", "okay so okay let's just say that's the", "98:10", "plan so far you can talk about what", "98:12", "problems it solves as much as you want", "98:15", "you're welcome to have it but okay so", "98:21", "here's my proposal so the plan could be", "98:24", "right and my proposal for who we draft", "98:27", "could be wrong and I'm happy to see", "98:29", "other people swapped in okay but my", "98:31", "proposal would be Admiral William", "98:34", "McRaven on the right you know who that", "98:37", "is", "98:37", "no I don't ok he is a Navy SEAL former", "98:40", "Navy SEAL he was until 2018 the", "98:44", "Chancellor of the University of Texas he", "98:47", "is a very cogent center-right Republican", "98:55", "he was the lead on the bin Laden raid", "98:59", "and he is", "99:01", "I think universally respected by people", "99:03", "who know him I've never heard anybody", "99:04", "say negative things about him on the", "99:09", "center-left let me see this gentleman", "99:12", "yeah you're gonna know oh yeah your", "99:18", "president to me yeah it looks like a", "99:19", "president to me too you know who else", "99:21", "looks like a president to me Oh Andrew", "99:23", "yang I'm down with that okay so like", "99:26", "what you're saying now good so here's my", "99:29", "point", "99:31", "those two guys together those two is", "99:34", "that camera on yes Admiral", "99:37", "your country needs you it really does", "99:40", "never more than now and I know that the", "99:44", "job of president is a sucky one I heard", "99:46", "the job of vice presidents even worse", "99:48", "but please consider this plan because", "99:52", "the Republic is in jeopardy", "99:56", "now we already know that Andrew yang is", "99:59", "up for the job because he ran for her", "100:00", "office yeah you know faced appallingly", "100:04", "stupid obstacles that in my opinion may", "100:07", "in be the reason that he's not the", "100:09", "nominee so here we got two people one of", "100:12", "them I think will do so out of duty the", "100:15", "other is crazy enough to want the job in", "100:16", "the first place and what are they well", "100:20", "they're both Patriots", "100:22", "they're both courageous and they're both", "100:24", "highly capable this is the road out I", "100:28", "don't know the Navy SEAL gentleman but", "100:33", "Raven McRaven but Andrew Yang has some", "100:37", "really good ideas yeah I mean and", "100:40", "reasonable ideas across the board and", "100:42", "when in terms of many things not just", "100:46", "universal basic income which was the", "100:47", "thing that he was most popular for but", "100:49", "but even law enforcement he's got some", "100:51", "great ideas about a lot of things he", "100:52", "thinks outside the box a brilliant guy", "100:54", "open to anything yes", "100:56", "I'm sorry reasonable so I would suggest", "100:57", "one last part of the plan right which is", "101:02", "that we Americans have to get over the", "101:04", "idea that when somebody runs for office", "101:06", "especially the office of the president", "101:09", "that the right reaction is to ask them a", "101:13", "million questions about what they will", "101:15", "do in office what policies they advocate", "101:17", "this is absurd presidents don't make", "101:19", "policy they certainly influence what", "101:21", "policy is made but the important thing", "101:23", "about a president is that they listen to", "101:25", "the right sorts of people and that they", "101:27", "have a mind capable of processing what", "101:29", "they hear so that they can integrate the", "101:32", "information necessary and in the case of", "101:34", "this plan we're talking about two people", "101:36", "who would do that as a team so what I", "101:38", "would really be interested in as they", "101:40", "are running against Trump and Biden is", "101:42", "hearing who it is that they would bring", "101:45", "into an administration how would they", "101:47", "make decisions about the things that", "101:49", "matter to us and figuring out who they", "101:51", "would bring in I think is bound to be", "101:53", "far more informative than dogging them", "101:56", "about you know what they're gonna do", "101:58", "about health care and how they're going", "102:00", "to pay for the thing about asking", "102:02", "someone what they're going to do though", "102:03", "is it does influence people whether or", "102:06", "not they're willing to vote for that", "102:08", "person they want to see a plan", "102:09", "I know what you're saying is a", "102:11", "reasonable person who understands the", "102:12", "system but for the average American they", "102:15", "do want to see a plan to how to get out", "102:18", "of a lot of the messes that we see well", "102:19", "you know the funny thing is we think a", "102:22", "lot of things are true about what people", "102:24", "want for one thing we've been told that", "102:26", "people are stupid and that you know", "102:28", "they're hopeless and if you know I mean", "102:32", "you're really one of the earliest", "102:35", "innovators here you have found that", "102:37", "people that we've been told have an", "102:39", "attention span so short that they can", "102:40", "only deal with a sitcom are interested", "102:43", "in a three-hour conversation about", "102:44", "complex topics with people from all over", "102:47", "the map right people are ready to listen", "102:49", "what I'm trying to say is we have a", "102:52", "wrong idea right in our in our sense of", "102:56", "what elections are and really that wrong", "102:57", "idea isn't even about the fact that we", "102:59", "think we want to hear the plan it's", "103:01", "about the fact that we know that our", "103:03", "power in the system is so limited that", "103:06", "the only way we could possibly exert any", "103:08", "influence on the policy that gets made", "103:10", "is if we can get somebody to promise us", "103:12", "something into a camera enough that", "103:13", "they're embarrassed not to do it when", "103:15", "they get an office and we also know that", "103:16", "doesn't work right they just do whatever", "103:19", "they're gonna do in ranch place", "103:21", "so my point would be look I will I will", "103:23", "literally vote for any competent", "103:26", "courageous Patriot I actually don't care", "103:29", "in what direction of their ruling yes I", "103:32", "would prefer that they were progressive", "103:34", "because I believe we need to make", "103:35", "progress or we will perish but any", "103:38", "courageous capable Patriot is good", "103:40", "enough because a courageous capable", "103:43", "Patriot will do way better than we are", "103:45", "doing with the current method yeah and", "103:47", "I'm seeing this one thing the I keep", "103:50", "hearing over and over again from people", "103:51", "on the left that really disturbs me it's", "103:53", "this concession that what you're voting", "103:55", "for is the cabinet you're voting for the", "103:58", "the you know you're the Supreme Court", "104:01", "you're voting for someone who's not", "104:04", "going to reverse Roe vs. Wade that's", "104:06", "what I keep hearing from my friends on", "104:07", "the left and you know they've basically", "104:10", "just they just made this concession in", "104:12", "their head like hey you know this is", "104:14", "what i'm voting for now they've given up", "104:16", "and the news media on the left has", "104:19", "completely ignored all of these Biden", "104:23", "speech", "104:23", "is that clearly show some sort of", "104:25", "cognitive decline in fact I've actually", "104:28", "like David Pakman who I respect a lot he", "104:31", "was kind of arguing against it that it", "104:33", "didn't that it didn't show his decline", "104:35", "and I was I was trying to look at it in", "104:38", "a way that it made sense I was trying to", "104:40", "be rational about him like okay maybe", "104:42", "he's just exhausted or maybe this or", "104:44", "maybe it's pressure you know sometimes", "104:46", "people get really tongue-tied and panic", "104:48", "under pressure and words come out all", "104:50", "fucked up that that is possible but", "104:53", "there's a trend and if you go back to", "104:55", "when he was a younger man that trend", "104:57", "didn't exist it's you're seeing it", "104:59", "you're seeing a change and the idea that", "105:02", "as you get older you become less", "105:05", "comfortable with the media less", "105:09", "comfortable with speaking publicly that", "105:10", "doesn't jive with me right that doesn't", "105:12", "make any sense so like I agree with you", "105:14", "I see a decline but irrespective of what", "105:17", "that is Joe Biden is an influence", "105:20", "peddler yes he is not an idea guy right", "105:23", "he's the same idea as Hillary Clinton in", "105:28", "a different morphology who cares this is", "105:32", "not an answer to any known question this", "105:35", "is stay the course at a moment when we", "105:37", "could not afford to stay the course less", "105:39", "right so look how dare the Democratic", "105:45", "Party do this to us again", "105:47", "at this moment well they did it to us", "105:49", "before this moment happened that's the", "105:52", "thing they did it to us before kovat and", "105:54", "they did to us before the looting and", "105:55", "before the damage it was this moment", "105:57", "these things think they thought it was", "105:58", "gonna happen the way it happened I", "106:00", "thought they when they if I thought that", "106:03", "I feel like they felt that if they got", "106:05", "Joe Biden in there if none of this stuff", "106:07", "had happened you would just be dealing", "106:10", "with one solution to the problem that is", "106:13", "Donald Trump right but even if we are if", "106:16", "we bend over backwards to be generous to", "106:19", "the Democratic Party yes it did this in", "106:20", "a moment when we didn't know that kovat", "106:23", "19 was going to spread right and we", "106:26", "didn't know that there was going to be", "106:27", "massive riots in the streets over who", "106:30", "knows how many cities we did we should", "106:33", "have known that this was building", "106:37", "right the possibility of a pandemic was", "106:39", "always on the table the fact that we", "106:41", "have a pandemic and that that makes it", "106:43", "clear well why we need a cogent leader", "106:46", "it was obvious that this could happen", "106:48", "under any presidency but there's a lot", "106:51", "of other things it's hard to say that", "106:53", "the possibility of a pandemic is on the", "106:55", "table so we should have been prepared", "106:56", "for it", "106:56", "I mean the possibility of an asteroid", "106:58", "will impacts on the table the", "106:59", "possibility of a solar flare that wipes", "107:01", "out the power grid always on the table", "107:03", "yeah but you're making my point my point", "107:04", "is you can never afford to have somebody", "107:08", "who isn't a courageous capable Patriot", "107:11", "in that office how dare they play games", "107:13", "with this thing it's not theirs to screw", "107:15", "up right and this also was highlighted", "107:18", "the problem of Donald Trump's ego yeah", "107:20", "you know I mean people would say these", "107:23", "egos yeah he's got an ego problem but", "107:25", "look he's getting the job done he's", "107:26", "doing great things but then in the face", "107:28", "of this pandemic when he's being", "107:31", "criticized like almost to the point", "107:33", "where he can't handle it anymore", "107:34", "you know like some people can run at a", "107:37", "pace of 5 miles an hour but when you", "107:39", "force him to run at a pace of 7 miles an", "107:42", "hour things get slippery you know you", "107:44", "start you start feeling cramps you start", "107:45", "looking for a way out and he's right now", "107:48", "about 9 miles an hour and it's not", "107:50", "looking good nothing's I mean he's", "107:52", "tweeting about not falling down a ramp", "107:55", "and why were you walking like that he's", "107:57", "all the fake news media

fragile you're", "108:07", "paying attention to criticisms the way", "108:09", "you walk down a slippery ramp like they", "108:11", "would have ignored that it would have", "108:13", "been a non-issue but it's an issue that", "108:15", "you your ego is so fragile that you have", "108:18", "to address the fact that they're", "108:19", "criticizing the way you walk down a ramp", "108:21", "with

kidding look the thing", "112:28", "about 2020 the thing about 2020 is I", "112:32", "don't you can make an argument about", "112:34", "what's possible but 2020 is not the year", "112:36", "to make such an argument in because it", "112:38", "through all the fuckin wrenches into the", "112:40", "gears every race and into the oil into", "112:44", "the eyes yeah it's fucking crazy I'm", "112:46",

"114:46", "is how so so I have initially I thought", "114:51", "that this was a bat borne virus that had", "114:54", "been transmitted to people from the wild", "114:58", "probably through the bushmeat trade", "115:00", "probably through the seafood market in", "115:02", "wuhan in fact Heather and I were in the", "115:05", "Amazon where we had no connectivity to", "115:07", "anything for a couple weeks when we came", "115:10", "out what was then called novel", "115:13", "coronavirus was just beginning to be", "115:15", "discussed and it so we became aware of", "115:18", "it as we came out of the Amazon's like", "115:19", "oh what the heck is not huh", "115:21", "and I looked into it and immediately I", "115:24", "saw the story adds up you know it's a", "115:26", "coronavirus of a kind that's known to", "115:28", "circulate in bats there's a seafood", "115:30", "market and I thought okay I know what", "115:32", "the story isn't I tweeted I don't know", "115:35", "enough about the story yet but looks to", "115:37", "me like the Wu hen on seafood market is", "115:39", "the source that the virus comes from", "115:41", "bats and we have to talk about the", "115:42", "bushmeat trade which has always been a", "115:44", "terrible idea and immediately people", "115:47", "tweeted back at me so you think it's", "115:49", "just a coincidence that there's a", "115:50", "biosafety lab level four in Wuhan where", "115:54", "this started and I thought what that's a", "115:58", "heck of a coincidence", "115:59", "and so I started to look into it I", "116:01", "retracted the tweet I said maybe I don't", "116:03", "know enough about the story yet and I", "116:05", "started to look into it and I went down", "116:07", "the rabbit hole because as much as we", "116:10", "have been assured by a huge range of", "116:13", "experts that this has to have been a bat", "116:18", "borne corona virus transmitted to people", "116:21", "possibly through pangolins maybe through", "116:23", "some intermediate hosts that we don't", "116:25", "yet know that story looks less and less", "116:29", "likely and the story that is looking", "116:32", "more and more likely what I would call",

itself has several", "116:59", "components that suggest that it is", "117:02", "actually the result of manipulation in", "117:04", "the lab and that it escaped probably", "117:07", "from the Han

fact that it was manipulated in the", "117:24", "lab so one of the techniques that labs", "117:26", "who study viruses like this they use is", "117:29", "something so the research is called", "117:31", "gain-of-function research", "117:32", "gain-of-function research", "117:34", "means you are taking a virus and you are", "117:37", "adding a capacity to it in order to", "117:39", "study how it works and then one of the", "117:42", "things that is done to study how it", "117:44", "works is something called passages where", "117:46", "a virus is infected and a creature is", "117:49",

that", "118:11", "this virus was under study that it was", "118:15", "enhanced in the laboratory and that we", "118:18", "are dealing with consequences that are", "118:20", "the result of that

the enhancements", "118:31", "there is a something called a foreign", "118:34", "site a fern site in the genome of this", "118:38", "virus fern sites are not known it", "118:41", "doesn't mean they don't exist but", "118:42", "they're not known from other beta corona", "118:44", "viruses and this fern site is", "118:47", "conspicuous its conspicuous in that it", "118:49", "is in the genome is an insert rather", "118:52", "than mutations of nucleotides that were", "118:55", "there it's like somebody spliced it in", "118:57", "that's one thing which could happen", "118:59", "naturally but it may well not have and", "119:02", "it has a flanking sequence which has", "119:05", "this is probably gonna be hard for", "119:08", "people to follow but nucleotides that is", "119:11", "DNA code for proteins which are made out", "119:15", "of amino acids there's an amino acid", "119:18", "called arginine and there are two", "119:20", "arginines coded for in the genome of", "119:22", "this virus but because there are so many", "119:25", "possible codes triplet codes and only 20", "119:29", "or so amino acids there's redundancy and", "119:32", "so which code is used to trigger the", "119:36",

way very frequently", "119:47", "so", "119:48", "let's just say there are elements of the", "119:51", "genome that are conspicuous and suggest", "119:54", "possible laboratory manipulation the", "119:57", "fern site that I refer to that has been", "120:00", "inserted either by a natural process or", "120:02", "by a laboratory process greatly", "120:06", "increases the transmissibility of

right the", "120:20", "list of symptoms is huge here and that's", "120:24", "a very troubling thing from the point of", "120:26", "view of treating it medically is all of", "120:27", "the things that can go wrong with the", "120:29", "body once you're infected it also means", "120:32", "that the virus is very good at jumping", "120:34", "between people and that high", "120:38", "transmissibility is obviously one of the", "120:40", "things that makes kovat 19 such a", "120:43", "difficult pandemic to control right it's", "120:46", "hopping between people so readily that", "120:49", "it just it runs away so in any case and", "120:54", "then there's a third question that I", "120:55", "have which is maybe that there's", "120:56", "something about the fact I don't want to", "121:00", "say fact as if it is a fact but if this", "121:03", "was an escape from the laboratory then", "121:06", "the virus I mean just as you know maybe", "121:09", "we'll end up talking about the telomere", "121:11", "problem in mice which you spoke to Eric", "121:15", "about when he was on your podcast last", "121:16", "but evolution to the lab evolution in", "121:20", "the lab takes place and changes that the", "121:23", "people in charge want to happen occur", "121:26", "and then things they're not even", "121:27", "thinking about occur", "121:28", "there's adaptation to the laboratory", "121:29", "environment the people who work in labs", "121:32", "are on unaware of and so one of the", "121:34", "questions I have is this virus is highly", "121:37", "transmissible unless you're outdoors", "121:40", "then it seems almost not transmissible", "121:43", "that's a very conspicuous I mean for one", "121:45", "thing bats live outdoors right so is it", "121:50", "possible that this virus has adapted to", "121:53", "the laboratory environment an indoor", "121:55", "environment and that it has forgotten", "121:57", "how to get transmitted outdoors and if", "121:59", "we are casual about the outdoor and fire", "122:02", "that actually it could relearn that", "122:04", "trick that we should take it we a we", "122:06", "need to be outdoors for various reasons", "122:08", "one it appears that vitamin D is very", "122:12", "protective in the case of kovat 19", "122:14", "prevents the transmission and you end up", "122:16", "way less sick if you have proper vitamin", "122:18", "D so in the northern hemisphere here", "122:21", "while the sun is shining we should be", "122:22", "outdoors we should not be locking down", "122:23", "those environments at all we should also", "122:26", "be very careful outdoors right because", "122:29", "anytime we allow it to be transmitted", "122:32", "outdoors that is going to that creates a", "122:35", "evolutionary signal a selective signal", "122:39", "that's going to retrain the virus to be", "122:41", "transmitted outdoors which is not", "122:43", "something we want at the moment this", "122:44", "might be an advantage that we have and", "122:46", "we're gonna lose it if we're not careful", "122:48", "which is why I'm very careful and why I", "122:51", "wear this thing around so that you know", "122:54", "I can pull it up at a moment's notice if", "122:55", "I'm going to talk to somebody because", "122:58", "even though I think the virus is very", "123:00", "difficult to transmit outdoors which is", "123:02", "something we've seen in the data of", "123:03", "South Korea for example it could learn", "123:08", "that trick and why is it easier for it", "123:10", "to trend do we know why don't know", "123:12", "indoors we don't know so we don't know", "123:14", "the mechanism and there's no good reason", "123:17", "that we don't know we should know", "123:19", "because it could be that it's UV light", "123:21", "UV light is very powerful destructive", "123:24", "stuff but if it's UV light then that", "123:27", "suggests it's difficult to transmit", "123:28", "outdoors during the day and it should be", "123:30", "easy to transmit outdoors at night if", "123:32", "it's not UV light then that's not likely", "123:35", "to be it so there is something weird", "123:38", "going on with viral load maybe it's not", "123:40", "weird but it's it's weird for those of", "123:42", "us who learned how viruses work from the", "123:44", "the usual textbook diagrams where a", "123:46", "virus gets into a cell and triggers and", "123:49", "infection but here it seems like if you", "123:52", "talk to someone briefly your chances of", "123:54", "picking it up from them even if they're", "123:55", "sick is pretty low but if you talk to", "123:58", "somebody for an extended period of time", "123:59", "or you're constantly breathing air that", "124:01", "they're exhaling then your chances go up", "124:03", "up up and up and that's so there's a", "124:06", "possibility that just exposure to UV", "124:08", "light as people even if they're outside", "124:10", "talking for the same amount of time just", "124:12", "the fact that these particles are going", "124:14", "through the air in the Sun", "124:15", "like that it kills the virus's ability", "124:17", "to transmit it's possible I don't know", "124:20", "that when you think about things like", "124:22", "your you know what a SteriPEN is Oh like", "124:26", "a UV it like it yeah it's a UV wand the", "124:28", "backpackers used so they can drink creek", "124:30", "water yeah it's crazy if you ever seen", "124:32", "one it's not doesn't even take that long", "124:34", "yeah you take this wand you put it in", "124:36", "like a bottle water bottle and you spin", "124:39", "it around in this creeks water and it", "124:41", "kills all the bad stuff totally and it's", "124:44", "weird man it's weird the light can do", "124:46", "that oh my goodness well the UV light is", "124:49", "amazing stuff yes well you know what", "124:52", "happened when Trump said something about", "124:54", "getting UV light into the body well", "124:56", "there was an actual publicly traded", "124:58", "biotech company that had an invention", "125:01", "for when people are intubated taking", "125:03", "this this tube with UV light and", "125:07", "inserting it into the lungs of these", "125:10", "people and they were actually pulled off", "125:12", "of Twitter Twitter actually banned their", "125:15", "account because they thought there was", "125:16", "some wacky Trump supporter who was", "125:18", "trying to substantiate the president the", "125:20", "president just got lucky you know he's", "125:22", "basically claiming to get the light put", "125:24", "it in the body somehow the body", "125:25", "disinfect the cleansing you remind me of", "125:28", "Sarah Cooper when you knew he was he was", "125:29", "on to something though in a weird way", "125:31", "that this publicly traded biotech", "125:33", "company had an idea that when people", "125:35", "they are on an Inc into what they have", "125:38", "been intubated when they are on this", "125:41", "ventilator this tube will go down the", "125:44", "same tube that the air is coming through", "125:45", "yeah and actually flood the lungs where", "125:48", "they're infected with kovat 19 with UV", "125:50", "light and kill it well the thing is I", "125:53", "don't think he got lucky I think he did", "125:54", "something that he's routinely doing", "125:56", "which isn't very high quality in terms", "125:58", "of leadership but somehow he's getting", "126:01", "briefings he's tuned into some channels", "126:04", "there was discussion I remember seeing", "126:07", "it there was discussion about how UV", "126:09", "light might be used to treat the cove at", "126:11", "19 infection and I was actually alerted", "126:15", "by this discussion to the fact that", "126:16", "there was apparently a lot of work on", "126:18", "this technique previously that actually", "126:20", "UV light had been successfully used in", "126:22", "various ways where it could be used to", "126:26", "purify blood and things and I was", "126:29", "surprised to discover it and then I", "126:30", "heard the president say this and I", "126:31", "thought that that's what he was talking", "126:32", "about my guess is something crossed his", "126:35", "feed somebody in a briefing said well", "126:38", "mr. president there is a promising", "126:40", "theory of promising therapy bla bla bla", "126:43", "bla bla uv-light bla bla bla bla bla and", "126:44", "he just walks out the door and riffs on", "126:46", "which is why Sarah Cooper is so funny", "126:48", "because basically she exposes the I", "126:51", "don't know who Sarah Cooper oh you know", "126:53", "maybe I do you've probably seen her", "126:55", "she's um making these videos where she", "126:58", "lip-synchs Trump oh that's no she's not", "127:03", "the one who did the thing where was it a", "127:06", "doctor faking Stein or the fake inning", "127:08", "put Trump's face on a baby have you ever", "127:11", "seen that one no I haven't seen that", "127:12", "well that one's wonderful the best ones", "127:15", "ever you haven't run into circular I may", "127:17", "have I've seen so many people mark him", "127:20", "it's so hard to keep track of who's who", "127:22", "okay but there she is yep let's give me", "127:26", "some volume on that more for the black", "127:28", "community than any other president and", "127:30", "let's take a pass on Abraham like him", "127:33", "because he did good although it's always", "127:36", "questionable you know in other words the", "127:38", "entries that we are free mr. president", "127:40", "but we Honest Abe is because you say you", "127:46", "in general that is the dumbest fucking", "127:48", "thing a person's ever said has been in", "127:50", "office well that may he's done more than", "127:53", "maybe Abe Lincoln who freed the slaves", "127:55", "he's giving a blink in a pass because he", "127:57", "did pretty good", "127:58", "how crazy is a it's crazy right just", "128:00", "like he's stuck he said something and", "128:03", "then he gets stuck trying to", "128:04", "substantiate what he said he should have", "128:06", "said except for obviously a Valenta to", "128:08", "sleep freed the slaves and everyone", "128:10", "would have been like yeah okay it's", "128:12", "braggadocious but perhaps reasonable", "128:14", "it's wrong and stupid but at least it's", "128:16", "not crazy so I absolutely fuckin and", "128:19", "saying yeah and then the fact that he's", "128:20", "saying it to a black woman's like oh my", "128:22", "god yeah well he so that's the thing is", "128:26", "he's winging it swinging that's what", "128:28", "she's doing she's just lip-syncing well", "128:29", "unfortunately I don't know whether the", "128:31", "audience saw it in sync or not find a", "128:33", "baby one the baby ones amazing if you", "128:35", "don't have it I could I could airdrop it", "128:38", "to you the baby one you need to say okay", "128:39", "I guess it's fucking amazing current", "128:41", "somebody it", "128:42", "either the faking or dr. fakin Stein do", "128:45", "you know who was Jamie do you remember", "128:46", "one of those fake artists who takes you", "128:49", "know they use the Face Swap technology", "128:51", "and they put Trump's face on this baby", "128:54", "and then they changed the words that", "128:57", "someone caught a baby doing something", "128:59", "and they talked to the baby and the baby", "129:01", "was trying to live and get their way out", "129:03", "of it it's like an old video but then", "129:05", "they put Trump's face on it and then", "129:06", "they changed here go ahead this is the", "129:11", "original baby Rachel's first yeah yes", "129:13", "you did", "129:16", "you touched its food it's adorable", "129:26", "so now President you said the virus was", "129:28", "just like the flu you did you also said", "129:32", "the virus could go away by April you", "129:37",

not heard that I", "131:34", "have but they let's put it this way", "131:37", "there are one of the things that is in", "131:41", "my opinion the strongest piece of", "131:42", "evidence that there that the lab leak", "131:46", "hypothesis may be correct is that there", "131:49", "is a missing phase in the evolution of", "131:52", "this virus when a virus jumps from one", "131:56", "species to

that the", "134:03", "addition of a fern site makes the virus", "134:06", "much more transmissible in human tissue", "134:08", "so if you were going to study it this", "134:10", "would be high in your

photo", "141:53", "of me in lanai wearing a full Sitka", "141:58", "outfit I look like a ninja lanai is a", "142:02", "very interesting place to hunt because", "142:04", "one of the few places where

that's a", "142:14", "net Gator and it's actually in the Sitka", "142:17", "the hunting gear that I'm wearing it's", "142:19", "actually built into the hood so in in", "142:22", "it's not just

when you're moving forward it could", "142:30", "slide down these animals that live there", "142:33", "there's literally 30,000 deer on an", "142:36", "island of 3,000 people and there it's an",

out of", "142:50", "control you've never seen anything like", "142:52", "it is crazy when you're there like the", "142:55", "mass populations and it happens to be", "142:57", "one of the most insanely delicious", "142:58", "animals as well also super switched on", "143:01", "because they evolved to avoid Tigers so", "143:05", "I've got videos of these things where in", "143:08", "arrows coming at them from eighty yards", "143:10", "and as the arrow is about you know 15", "143:13", "yards away they hear it and they're get", "143:14", "out of the way they move so fast like", "143:16", "they're the fastest deer I've ever", "143:18", "encountered in my life by far like", "143:20", "nothing's even close to them and you", "143:23", "know you you have to be sneaky to get", "143:25", "close to these things yeah that's why", "143:26", "you dress like that that's cool in some", "143:28", "sense so actually can I connect that the", "143:31", "the viral questions or okay so the", "143:33", "connections going to be a weird one", "143:35", "there is only one terrestrial mammal", "143:39", "natively in Hawaii there's only one", "143:43", "terrestrial mammal species", "143:44", "okay there's aquatic there's whales and", "143:46", "things but and seals but there's uh", "143:49", "there's only one terrestrial mammal", "143:51", "trying to guess what that Bay yeah a", "143:54", "mammal terrestrial mammal", "143:57", "well terrestrial may be misleading here", "143:59", "I just mean on land Oh", "144:01", "seal nope no well they're seals but", "144:03", "that's it's an aquatic mammal okay it's", "144:07", "a bat oh right so here's the thing", "144:10", "Hawaii is as remote from mainland as", "144:14", "anywhere there is really isolated", "144:17", "you know and that means that the story", "144:20", "of how a terrestrial mammal gets there", "144:23", "is pretty rare because think about the", "144:27", "condition how would almost any", "144:28", "terrestrial mammal you can think of get", "144:30", "there so at some point some pregnant bat", "144:33", "probably got blown off-course by a storm", "144:35", "and probably barely crawled up on the", "144:39", "beach you know you know so they flew", "144:42", "thousands of miles well my guess is it", "144:45", "almost never happens", "144:47", "but it did happen once with this bat but", "144:50", "anyway my point would be Hawaii is a", "144:52", "tropical landmass you would think it", "144:56", "would have high diversity because it's", "144:58", "tropical right", "144:59", "tropical places tend to have very high", "145:01", "diversity Hawaii has very low diversity", "145:03", "because it's so far from everywhere", "145:05", "all right so the thing is almost nothing", "145:07", "can make it over the gap that big", "145:10", "saltwater gap is very hard for anything", "145:12", "to cross so what that means is that", "145:14", "everything that's in Hawaii is very well", "145:18", "adapted for things like crossing huge", "145:20", "gaps and not very well adapted for", "145:23", "everything that would compete with that", "145:25", "capacity so that sets Hawaii up for", "145:29", "being invaded by any creature that you", "145:34", "transport there if you can solve the how", "145:37", "do you jump the gap question by", "145:38", "transporting on an airplane or a ship", "145:40", "then the species that are there are not", "145:43", "in a position to fend it off", "145:44", "competitively because they're not", "145:46", "adapted to compete it's a low diversity", "145:48", "environment where everything had to", "145:50", "cross some amazing gap to get there so", "145:52", "it's a sitting duck for invasive species", "145:55", "like the one you're describing okay now", "145:59", "here's the connection to the viruses if", "146:03", "it is true that this virus originally", "146:07", "came from a bat was being studied in", "146:09", "probably the Wuhan Institute of Virology", "146:12", "was enhanced and then escaped was", "146:15", "enhanced for the infection of human", "146:17", "tissue and then escaped it is the", "146:20", "equivalent of us having transported", "146:22", "something very dangerous over a gap it", "146:26", "couldn't have crossed on its own", "146:28", "right and we are sitting ducks for this", "146:30", "thing mmm", "146:33", "so this is why I'm really on high alert", "146:37", "about this now what are your feelings", "146:39", "when it comes to the high number of", "146:42", "people that are asymptomatic or the high", "146:45", "number of people that get it and it's", "146:48", "very small deal to them they just call", "146:51", "for a couple days and then it's no big", "146:53", "deal", "146:53", "yes well so I've been advocating from", "146:57", "the start that we should be much more", "146:59", "aggressive in the way we are studying", "147:01", "this that in fact you remember the", "147:04", "aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt", "147:06", "had an outbreak and it docked in Guam", "147:10", "mm-hmm", "147:11", "my thought was I want to see that", "147:15", "carrier used to study the virus it's too", "147:19", "bad that it docked in Guam because they", "147:20", "ruined a circumstance and it's not that", "147:23", "I wanted to see people infected and it's", "147:24", "not that I didn't I wanted to see them",

constantly", "153:59", "getting sick so I think what we're", "154:02", "learning is that there are a lot of", "154:04", "viruses that could potentially jump and", "154:06", "could potentially adapt to humans when", "154:08", "they do jump they almost never spread", "154:10", "can I ask you a question before you", "154:12", "continue char's because if I was going", "154:13", "to deviate a soft topic was there there", "154:16", "was a story that I read a long time ago", "154:18", "and I think I read it in the New York", "154:19", "Times and it was a story about these", "154:22", "people that were

"154:49", "warned you that it was a bad story", "154:52", "but I remember reading this story that", "154:54", "you know they talked about the millions", "154:57", "and millions of bats that flew at us", "154:59", "can't believe it was in Africa they flew", "155:01", "out of this cave and that they shit", "155:03", "whenever they fly out and that these", "155:06", "people didn't think about this they just", "155:07", "wanted to film this thing and they just", "155:09", "got covered in bat shit and it got in", "155:11", "their eyes it got everywhere and they", "155:14", "got a horrible virus from it it was", "155:15", "definitely a virus no I mean", "155:18", "so there's remember them getting really", "155:20", "sick and dying shortly afterwards and", "155:22", "them not being able to identify exactly", "155:24", "what it was that killed them so let me", "155:26", "let me say a couple things on this front", "155:29", "one there is a pathogen that people who", "155:31", "study bats in caves my bats didn't roost", "155:34", "in caves but people who study bats in", "155:36", "caves sometimes get histoplasmosis which", "155:38", "is a fungus it's a fungus that's also", "155:41", "flix people in the poultry industry um", "155:44", "so anyway that's a danger there are", "155:48", "viruses but the story that you're", "155:50", "describing suggests the pattern that I'm", "155:54", "suggesting which is that sometimes", "155:58", "things jump they don't tend to spread", "156:00", "that jump and spread are two different", "156:02", "skills and the chances that something", "156:04", "jumps are relatively small when", "156:07", "something jumps it then has to spread it", "156:09", "has to accomplish both tricks in order", "156:11", "to become a pandemic and the likelihood", "156:14", "of it doing both things well is pretty", "156:16", "low so most of the time it doesn't jump", "156:18", "and when it does jump it doesn't tend to", "156:19", "spread and it sounds like your example", "156:22", "of these people tragic as it is", "156:25", "represents a case in which something", "156:26", "jumped but didn't spread mmm now there", "156:29", "is also the the lab leak stuff is", "156:33", "extensive but there is one of the pieces", "156:36", "of evidence in that story is that there", "156:39", "were some miners in Yunnan who came down", "156:42", "with an ammonia there was something like", "156:44", "six miners who came down with pneumonia", "156:46", "who had worked in a cave that had these", "156:49", "horseshoe bats so to the extent that the", "156:51", "lab in Wuhan was known to be working on", "156:54", "bat coronaviruses for the purpose of", "156:57", "preventing a pandemic they were getting", "156:59", "their bat coronaviruses from this cave", "157:02", "in Yunnan Province long way from Wuhan", "157:05", "and the cave was identified because", "157:08", "these miners had come down with this", "157:10", "pneumonia of which I think three of them", "157:12", "died so it's again a case in which", "157:14", "something jumped but it didn't spread no", "157:17", "pandemic arose out of it so what we're", "157:19", "looking at is the strong possibility", "157:20", "that we were looking to prevent a", "157:24", "pandemic at some place where something", "157:25", "had jumped but had not spread and then", "157:27", "we took viruses from there and imbued", "157:30", "them with the characteristics that", "157:31", "allowed them to", "157:31", "bread so only its second problem so", "157:34", "that's a frightening story to me it is", "157:37", "frightening and is it particularly", "157:39", "frightening that it's coming out of", "157:40", "China because we're not getting really", "157:42", "good information from them because their", "157:44", "propaganda is so strong yes and no", "157:47", "Chinese have not behaved well they have", "157:50", "not informed us in the way we need to be", "157:52", "informed on the other hand

been", "158:01", "amplified by the president that this is", "158:06", "potentially if this leaked from the lab", "158:08", "that this is a Chinese problem yes this", "158:11", "lab in China was part

two years they had", "158:42", "gotten safety violations yes and there", "158:45", "was a 2015 paper concerned about", "158:50", "gain-of-function research and the", "158:51", "potential for exactly this sort of thing", "158:53", "to happen so anyway there was concern", "158:56", "but like so many things I think it", "158:58", "hovers outside of most of our awareness", "159:00", "so we discover

creatures like us get old", "160:33", "and die and the answer was basically", "160:36", "this that you have a genome that's", "160:40", "complex", "160:41", "it's full of genes but there aren't",

longer", "161:48", "than others even when you correct for", "161:50", "things like body size so creatures that", "161:52", "fly live longer than creatures that are", "161:54", "of the same type and

so we knew that this hypothesis was", "162:22", "right but what we had never found at the", "162:25", "point that I was working in the very", "162:27", "late 90s on this was a gene that matched", "162:30", "the description we knew that selection", "162:32", "was finding these genes and accumulating", "162:35", "them but we had never found one of the", "162:37", "genes in question and that was very", "162:38", "conspicuous I called that the missing", "162:40", "playa trophy so anyway I was sort of on", "162:44", "alert about this it was a curious fact", "162:46", "and I saw a talk given by somebody who", "162:52", "was talking about telomeres", "162:54", "and he was talking about telomeres in", "162:56", "their relationship to cancer so", "162:58", "telomeres are repetitive sequences of", "163:00", "DNA at the ends of our chromosomes and", "163:02", "they grow shorter every time a cell", "163:06", "divides all right so it's like a fuse or", "163:09", "a counter that ticks down

"164:07", "right I put two and two together and I", "164:09", "said this is the missing playa trophy", "164:12", "here we have something that is", "164:14", "protecting us that's helping us in youth", "164:15", "we have a counter that is limiting the", "164:17", "number of times a cell can divide and", "164:19", "presumably preventing cancer right and", "164:22", "the cost is you can't maintain

about", "167:59", "senescence and cancer and aging might", "168:02", "well be true", "168:03", "that was important but it also raised a", "168:07", "bunch of really difficult problems one", "168:11", "was if it is true that all the mice that", "168:14", "are being used to study physiology are", "168:17", "broken in this way then how are we", "168:19", "blinding ourselves is it possible that", "168:22", "we are using all of these mice that", "168:24", "would be terrible models for wound", "168:26", "healing for senescence for cancer for a", "168:29", "whole number of things", "168:32", "how is it that we are allowing ourselves", "168:34", "to take these mice who have been altered", "168:38", "and using them as models for normal", "168:41", "physiology", "168:42", "the other problem may

that you thought was", "168:55", "useful and you wanted to test whether it", "168:57", "was safe to administer it to people you", "169:00", "can't really afford to give people a", "169:02", "drug and then wait 4050 years to figure", "169:06", "out whether you've shortened their lives", "169:07", "right so at the point that you start", "169:10", "testing these things on humans you're", "169:11",

"169:33", "years that a little shorten the mouse's", "169:35", "life long enough to see it but here's", "169:37", "the problem if you've altered a mouse in", "169:41", "the laboratory environment by

and then when those", "170:33", "drugs were released into the human", "170:34", "population it turned out they were not", "170:36", "safe and people docked", "170:38", "and the problem is I was

"doesn't the Vioxx scandal which was it", "171:35", "was a drug for arthritis correct yeah", "171:38", "gay people strokes yeah it did heart", "171:40", "damage yeah and so anyway heart damage", "171:42", "is actually probably not heart damage", "171:46", "and by that what I mean is if you take a", "171:49", "drug a substance that damages tissues in", "171:53", "the human body it will show up as heart", "171:57", "damage because of the special nature of", "171:59", "the heart so let's say that you took", "172:00", "some drug that you know killed every", "172:03", "10,000 cell or every

"172:59", "300 pages it doesn't mention mice it", "173:01", "doesn't mention the genus Massa do you", "173:03", "think they did that to protect", "173:04", "themselves well what I know is that I", "173:07", "attempted to call their attention after", "173:09", "the report came out I looked at it and", "173:12", "you know it had a physical form but it", "173:13", "also had it lives online you can search", "173:15", "it and I could see that telomeres", "173:17", "weren't mentioned mice weren't mentioned", "173:19", "rodents aren't mentioned and so I tried", "173:22", "to alert them to the fact that they had", "173:24", "screwed up and I they blew me off they", "173:27", "wouldn't talk to me so that is it raises", "173:31", "a question and I to this day cannot", "173:35", "answer the question I can't even say", "173:37", "whether or not so when I've tried to", "173:40", "raise this issue I have run into various", "173:46", "kinds of resistance if I raise it with", "173:48",

few", "173:58", "phone calls and then they come back to", "173:59", "me and they either they go silent or", "174:02", "they say well I talked to some people", "174:05", "and they said it's been taken care of", "174:07", "right well I don't know what it's been", "174:09", "taken care of means I published a paper", "174:11", "that said here's a hypothesis about", "174:13", "what's going on here's my

altered the the", "174:35", "breeding protocol and they fixed the", "174:36", "problem you still have all those drug", "174:38", "tests that they've done for you got all", "174:41", "those drug tests you've got all of the", "174:42", "papers you've got my paper which", "174:45", "proposes a hypothesis and I have a right", "174:48", "to say actually it turns out to be", "174:49", "correct or it wasn't right but so anyway", "174:51", "we got back all of these weird answers", "174:54", "it's been taken care of or even more", "174:58", "curious is the argument well everybody", "175:00", "knows that the mice are bad models which", "175:03", "is insane because this", "175:05", "tell him you actually got that response", "175:06", "yeah from several people I went to", "175:10", "several
