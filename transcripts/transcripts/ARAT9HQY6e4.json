everything was kind of what we", "01:38", "expected and we'd spent a lot of time", "01:40", "and preparing for that um yeah just I", "01:44", "you know kind of expected round one for", "01:49", "sure gonna get a takedown so the the", "01:52", "goal of round one was to get out of it", "01:53", "still having energy we didn't want to", "01:56", "put a huge amount of effort into trying", "01:58", "to get back open real one it seemed to", "02:00", "happen many times and his other", "02:01", "opponents and he kind of got back to the", "02:03", "still you know really tired so realm on", "02:06", "make him pay you know do our best on the", "02:08", "way in fight as hard as we can but if we", "02:10", "do end up down it which is against", "02:13", "figured we'll be there tried to stay",

bit more than", "02:44", "we hoped for Roundtree teams started", "02:47", "kind of turning a little bit in our", "02:49", "favor and we did a lot better at keeping", "02:51", "it in the middle defending the takedowns", "02:53", "so the plan was to slow him down a", "02:55", "little watch him slow down a little bit", "02:57", "in the third fourth and fifth yeah", "02:59", "exactly yeah so I think at the beginning", "03:01", "that the the consensus was Carla knocks", "03:04", "him out in the first or Herbie you know", "03:06", "takes over from two on like first to win", "03:09", "the third round was probably a bit of a", "03:10", "surprise to people but and you know you", "03:13", "know phthalic went to fight if you look", "03:15", "at that from eritrean he wasn't able to", "03:17", "hit any takedowns and so hoped that's", "03:20", "what we have a go around tree we could", "03:23", "defend two takedowns a lot easier and", "03:24", "start landing air shots and that did", "03:26", "happen for a fir entry not as well as I", "03:29", "as we plan not as well as we hoped", "03:31", "and then round four you know we hit", "03:34", "another great takedown made it mistake", "03:37", "given off the over hook exposed to her", "03:38", "back and that was all she wrote", "03:40", "yeah he has such a unique ability to tie", "03:43", "both legs up with his legs yeah and", "03:47", "round one I thought Conor said well we", "03:49", "practice for that for to keep our legs", "03:51", "bent you see guys he straightened her", "03:53", "legs and then from and Conor did do that", "03:55", "a couple of times but he was able to", "03:57", "continuously get a leg free so not until", "04:00", "the last 30 seconds or so of round one", "04:02", "he didn't really tied him up and get him", "04:04", "flattens back for the majority of that", "04:06", "he was against defence you know used his", "04:09", "hands to keep upright tried to learn", "04:11", "little shots yeah",

"see where you were", "04:28", "take me wedgie hey it's a work in", "04:30", "progress you uh you worked with him on", "04:32", "his way cut like what what was his", "04:34", "weight before he started camp um you", "04:36", "know it's almost exactly the same way it", "04:39", "was when we we actually started the cut", "04:42", "you know we want to make sure that his", "04:45", "weight was little higher than you know", "04:47", "obviously with the boxing with Floyd you", "04:49", "know speed is everything and we wanted", "04:51", "to kind of slowly drop that way down but", "04:55", "with this want to keep him as big as", "04:56", "possible and then you know cut all that", "04:57", "weight so he what was his way he was", "05:00", "about 171 when he got back into that", "05:02", "cage so so what was his weight when you", "05:05", "guys started camp uh about that same", "05:07", "thing same thing exact same thing yeah", "05:09", "it was all about so it's not an extreme", "05:11", "way cut no 15 ish pounds in terms of", "05:14", "cutting it was easy what's the most", "05:17", "you've ever had someone cut um so you", "05:19", "know on record with drew Dober he showed", "05:22", "up at 185 on Tuesday and had to make 155", "05:25", "by Friday so yeah that's the biggest one", "05:32", "biggest one on record he's a big fella", "05:34", "I've always looked at drew Dober and go",

like", "05:47", "it's probably not the healthiest thing", "05:49", "in the world for him to do either no I", "05:51", "mean I'll never I'll never be like you", "05:53", "know weight cutting is the happiest", "05:55", "thing in the world but I will say that", "05:56", "like because the amount of muscle mass", "05:58", "people look at somebody like him and", "05:59", "they're like embalming he doesn't have a", "06:01", "lot to lose and he doesn't have a lot to", "06:03", "lose but he's got a lot to cut muscle is", "06:06", "about 17 muscle tissues about 79 percent", "06:09", "water so more muscle you have the more", "06:10", "water you can cut you know so if you do", "06:13", "it properly", "06:15", "the more muscle you have the easier it", "06:16", "is for that cut and that's why he's able", "06:18", "to do that how did you learn how to do", "06:20", "this honestly man like I could be like", "06:24", "when I got this degree and I got this", "06:25", "degree but there's no degree in actual", "06:26", "weight cutting", "06:28", "Marine Corps and I was a heavyweight", "06:31", "when I started fighting and then I ended", "06:33", "up as a welterweight and Wow", "06:36", "yeah yeah didn't do so well as a world", "06:38", "away kind of the opposite of Anthony", "06:40", "Rumble Johnson right right you know was", "06:43", "definitely not it wasn't it didn't work", "06:45", "out well for me I was better at cutting", "06:47", "the weight and I was actually at", "06:49", "fighting but learning through this", "06:52", "process okay this this this works like", "06:55", "this and this works like this and", "06:56", "there's I mean there's so many studies", "06:59", "they're out there you don't like you", "07:01", "like the NSE yeah you look at you know", "07:04", "PubMed and all these other things you", "07:06", "you see I study over here and you see a", "07:07", "study here okay we're gonna put these", "07:09", "two together and actually see in terms", "07:13", "of actual weight cutting it's it's rough", "07:15", "because nobody's ever actually gonna do", "07:18", "a study with the level of dehydration", "07:21", "that these guys are doing you all right", "07:23", "like oh yeah this this how you rehydrate", "07:25", "these people mm-hmm it's never it's", "07:27", "never gonna happen", "07:28", "so you know luckily we've you know the", "07:32", "amount of custody we work with over 200", "07:34", "UFC fighters and just just I mean just", "07:36", "in the UFC I mean you obviously work", "07:38", "with a lot more like Bellator and stuff", "07:40", "like that but being able see that okay", "07:42", "this works this doesn't work when you", "07:46", "say you work with them if you work with", "07:47", "200 fighters how hands-on are you with", "07:50", "200 different fighters it changes you", "07:54", "know based on you know how how much they", "07:57", "need us you know a lot of the guys we", "07:58", "literally don't show up until the week", "08:00", "of the fight you know some of that", "08:02", "corner you know I'm out there six stay", "08:05", "weeks I'm out there and monitoring", "08:07", "everything and you know the people that", "08:10", "we are out there for four four eight", "08:11", "weeks", "08:12", "it makes life a lot easier now do you", "08:15", "have anything to do with his meal", "08:17", "planning as well like during the camp", "08:19", "corner yeah a hundred percent everything", "08:22", "to his mouth I'm monitoring so from the", "08:26", "moment you guys start in camp 100% what", "08:29", "about outside of camp is he taking", "08:31", "instruction from you and yeah yeah", "08:33", "Carter you don't you get me okay I'm", "08:35", "doing this you know like in terms of", "08:37", "like workout that's", "08:38", "one for him like all that pre-workout", "08:40", "post-workout what should I be taking I", "08:43", "tell him exactly what he should be", "08:44", "taking and then you know he basically", "08:46", "stays on a regimen and acting today man", "08:49", "like diet the word diet means fujita", "08:51", "habitual way and I like guys to actually", "08:56", "live life a little bit you know what I'm", "08:57", "saying when you're you're so regimen", "08:59", "like okay I got a I got account this car", "09:01", "but I got account this I got it's it's", "09:04", "ridiculous you know what I'm saying so", "09:06", "you know the fact that he actually is", "09:08", "like okay I just I just need to monitor", "09:09", "what I'm taking pre post-workout makes", "09:12", "life easy for me did you go to school", "09:15", "for nutrition like in the Marine Corps I", "09:18", "was a combat conditioning specialist I", "09:20", "was that actually instructor trainer so", "09:22", "like when you go there's this place", "09:25", "called martial arts center of excellence", "09:27", "right", "09:27", "and they actually hand-picked Marines he", "09:33", "kind of been you know like in you know", "09:35", "certain situations in the military Brian", "09:39", "Stann was was actually you know a part", "09:41", "of that and then they actually started", "09:43", "something called the combat conditioning", "09:46", "program and I was actually the the guy", "09:49", "that they actually had to teach all that", "09:53", "so they sent me everywhere like I got to", "09:55", "work with the the people from the", "09:58", "Olympic Training Center you know I got", "10:01", "to work with the P I in Florida you know", "10:03", "like just learn from a lot of different", "10:06", "people but in terms of like I always say", "10:09", "this from way cut and there's actually", "10:10", "not a saw like there's not a course like", "10:12", "you know if you're a dietitian or", "10:13", "whatever that's that's great but that", "10:16", "doesn't help you with in terms of wake", "10:18", "up right you go somebody's like hey man", "10:19", "I gotta lose 30 pounds in three days you", "10:23", "know it's a very specific kind of", "10:24", "discipline and so it's something that", "10:26", "you kind of have to learn along the way", "10:27", "and no one's gonna teach you in a school", "10:29", "100% but you do have a back some sort of", "10:32", "background in nutrition 100 and do you", "10:37", "vary your diets based on the way guys", "10:40", "trained or is it like pretty standard or", "10:43", "does it vary depending upon how much", "10:45", "weight they have to lose no no it every", "10:47", "diet is different like I mean people", "10:50", "like themselves never be the same", "10:53", "twice the same person so like if you", "10:57", "wake up at 6 o'clock the morning versus", "10:59", "eight o'clock good morning you have to", "11:00", "have a totally different diet you don't", "11:02", "like we feed people from the moment they", "11:04", "wake up to the moment they go to bed", "11:05", "what would be the day if someone likes", "11:07", "to get up at 6 o'clock in the morning", "11:08", "versus someone let's get it up at 8", "11:09", "right would it be in what time they have", "11:12", "to train that would that be the variable", "11:14", "that's one variable you don't we base", "11:16", "everything off type tight timing portion", "11:19", "size or hormonal responses of foods you", "11:21", "know I'm saying like most diets nowadays", "11:26", "they actually you know they kind of", "11:28", "stick to one aspect like the Atkins diet", "11:31", "you know it sticks to the types of foods", "11:33", "you know like Zone diet is portion size", "11:36", "we we actually stick to all of them you", "11:39", "know like type timing portion size women", "11:41", "response food because you know if you", "11:45", "look at all diets they they all work all", "11:47", "diets will work you know like if you're", "11:49", "if you're consistent to every single", "11:51", "diet if you do the same thing every", "11:52", "single day you think you see you're", "11:54", "gonna see results but are you going to", "11:57", "get to a specific weight and is your", "11:59", "performance gonna be you know", "12:01", "increased overall if I camp you know", "12:04", "that that's when nutrition becomes you", "12:07", "know the extreme valuable what would be", "12:10", "the difference between someone getting", "12:11", "up at 6:00 and someone giving up an", "12:12", "eight-oh time the you know so if", "12:15", "somebody wakes up at 6:00 they're gonna", "12:16", "eat it 6 o'clock the morning somebody", "12:17", "gets up at 8 doing either 8 o'clock in", "12:19", "the morning we feel you have them you", "12:21", "have a meet as soon as they wake up yeah", "12:22", "absolutely", "12:23", "yes sir you you you feed somebody till", "12:25", "the moment they woke up to the more to", "12:26", "go to bed like what would be a typical", "12:28", "breakfast meal we we we live off the the", "12:32", "basic rule you give give people what", "12:35", "they need when they need it so you know", "12:36", "if you're aerobic all right your body's", "12:38", "primary source of fuel is gonna be more", "12:39", "fats your brains primary source of fuel", "12:42", "is gonna be carbohydrates or glucose", "12:45", "right so we we give them like a lot of", "12:48", "fruits right the glucose feed the brain", "12:51", "a lot of fats you know we make sure that", "12:53", "we you know we get a good measurement of", "12:54", "Omega 3s 2 Omega 6s basically about", "12:58", "about a 2 to 1 ratio so throughout the", "13:00", "day you know if they're if they're", "13:02", "we throughout the day we give them you", "13:04", "know fruits vegetables omega-6 omega-3s", "13:08", "and then when once they start working", "13:10", "out then you know depending on the work", "13:11", "out then that's we start giving like", "13:13", "more starches and stuff like that so", "13:15", "basically just sort of like breakfast of", "13:17", "fruits and things along those lines to", "13:19", "get everything moving understand and", "13:21", "then after you first work out like", "13:22", "what's a typical post-workout meal I", "13:25", "depends on the actual workout we use", "13:26", "something called when you got the", "13:28", "metabolic equivalent right so basically", "13:30", "the met is the amount of oxygen your", "13:32", "body uses and that that's going to", "13:34", "determine basically the amount of", "13:36", "calories at your body so let's say a", "13:38", "strength and conditioning workout what", "13:39", "if they're going to do weights and", "13:41", "sprints and things all right so what", "13:44", "we'll do is everything is actually like", "13:47", "a formula everything's everything is", "13:49", "brick broken down mathematically so", "13:51", "we'll take their met and we'll we're", "13:55", "going to scale of one to ten and we", "13:57", "multiply that by the actual amount of", "13:59", "weight that that individual has like", "14:00", "kilogram so we'll say their intensity is", "14:03", "a ten let's say they have a hard workout", "14:05", "intensity of ten we multiply that by the", "14:07", "amount of kilograms that that individual", "14:11", "has I believe and then look at the", "14:14", "formula we basically divide that by 200", "14:18", "to multiply that by the duration I", "14:19", "actual workout and that'll give us the", "14:20", "amount of actual calories that that", "14:22", "individual was actually using for that", "14:24", "workout so every workout is going to be", "14:26", "different so if you're if you're if", "14:28", "you're doing like what's the word I'm", "14:33", "looking for like training in terms of", "14:34", "like guard passing and stuff like that", "14:38", "it's gonna be a lot different than if", "14:39", "you're sparring right so a lot of people", "14:41", "they actually they feed themselves the", "14:43", "same way if they're if they're doing", "14:44", "form versus actually training like", "14:47", "sparring you don't they they do the same", "14:49", "thing I'm gonna take two you know I'm", "14:50", "too stupid protein I'm gonna take this", "14:52", "this and this you have to you have to", "14:54", "actually feed the body differently every", "14:56", "single every single right so we'll take", "15:00", "that formula we find out okay this", "15:02", "amount of calories that this individual", "15:03", "burns during this period of time and", "15:05", "then we actually break it down even more", "15:06", "because if you jog and you burn a", "15:09", "thousand calories right and if you lift", "15:12", "and burn a thousand calories", "15:13", "same amount of calories but you have to", "15:16", "refuel the body differently because if", "15:17", "your job your by using a lot more fat if", "15:20", "you're if you're a lift and your body", "15:21", "doing a lot more carbohydrates again it", "15:23", "goes to giving the body what it needs", "15:24", "what it needs it so we'll look at it", "15:27", "like okay well if it's a level of 10 and", "15:30", "then will literally eat when we have the", "15:31", "formulas forward so I tend would be", "15:34", "80/20 so you find out the amount of", "15:37", "calories this individual is burning and", "15:39", "80/20 meaning 80% carbohydrates 20%", "15:42", "proteins right and kind of carbohydrates", "15:45", "you mostly funk so your body has some", "15:49", "called", "15:49", "you have receptors in the body right you", "15:53", "know people think that like well you'll", "15:54", "fight a fight if I need carbohydrates my", "15:56", "body's just going to ingest them and it", "15:59", "doesn't work like that", "16:00", "your body can process about one gram of", "16:03", "carbohydrate per minute right but if you", "16:05", "are able to actually access more", "16:07", "actually use more than one transporter", "16:13", "than at a time you can actually go to", "16:16", "about 2 3 2 point 3 grams per minute and", "16:20", "yeah yeah blue one blue two blue three", "16:23", "before and you got sq 1s clue too", "16:26", "it's one of these has a different thing", "16:29", "that actually activates him right like", "16:31", "an Eskimo 2 is a soul independent", "16:33", "transporter right if you if you use a", "16:36", "sodium dependent transporter blue forest", "16:38", "is an insulin dependent transporter blue", "16:41", "one is I believe I'm sorry blue 5 is a", "16:45", "fructose it's activated by fructose", "16:47", "right so if you use more than one of", "16:49", "these transporters at a time you", "16:51", "activate these transporters they're", "16:53", "literally you're able to actually", "16:54", "synthesize carbohydrates twice as fast", "16:58", "so you're doing different types of", "17:00", "carbohydrates and mixing them together", "17:01", "saying like what would be example of a", "17:03", "group 1s blue one is sort of independent", "17:06", "transporter so you gotta make solar", "17:08", "independent you got to make sure that", "17:09", "you add sodium right blue for is the", "17:12", "insulin dependent transporters what",

you", "71:28", "know I mean his shots warden as crisp as", "71:31", "they normally are", "71:31", "he had opportunities to hit him", "71:33", "especially in the third round and he", "71:35", "just seemed to be deranged something was", "71:38", "off and it had to do with the fact that", "71:41", "he hadn't fought MMA in two years", "71:42", "absolutely you know that's right yeah of", "71:45",

the gym which was you", "72:00", "know is he at a position now where every", "72:03", "fight has to be a gigantic super fight", "72:06", "and is that Ness is that a problem in", "72:08", "that you know what I thought after the", "72:10", "fight after it was all over I was like", "72:12", "you know what a good fight would be", "72:13", "would be him versus Pettis like that", "72:16", "would be a really good fight and it", "72:18", "would be a really interesting fight in", "72:19", "terms stylistic matchup and it would be", "72:22", "a great fight I think for Conor to sort", "72:25", "of just get a wild three-round or I", "72:28", "guess it would probably the main event", "72:29", "it would be five rounds but uh it would", "72:31", "be a wild fight yeah that would probably", "72:33", "favor him yeah yeah I mean that the", "72:35", "boxing huh you know when Tyson Fury was", "72:37", "kind of coming back together man yes you", "72:40", "know not the toughest going into World", "72:41", "shit doesn't happen if it doesn't happen", "72:43", "in MMA there's an issue with that I", "72:48", "think yeah you know Eve's yeah you know", "72:52", "in his early stages who's fighting all", "72:54", "the time and as is natural as you get", "72:57", "older and as you achieve more it is", "72:59", "going to start becoming you know once or", "73:01", "twice a year it's just a natural", "73:02", "progression of an athlete I don't care", "73:04", "who you are but the wild fights that he", "73:06", "could have at 155 pounds whether it's", "73:09", "James Vick or just engag or Pettis or", "73:13", "there's good fights for him yes that", "73:15", "aren't necessarily could be they aren't", "73:16", "necessarily Tony Ferguson but they're a", "73:19", "good fight to get that timing back get", "73:22", "everything locked in you know 100% but", "73:25", "you you have to factor in his", "73:26", "personality and he's only fighting now", "73:29", "for fights that are really interesting", "73:30", "to him he's not that interest in anybody", "73:32", "not that I feared Mayweather paper right", "73:39", "so you know yeah what more can he you", "73:42", "know even with his spending well that", "73:44", "would be the the eye on the future and", "73:46", "odd the eye on the rematch you know", "73:48", "getting everything dialed in so that", "73:50", "when he does have a rematch with khabib", "73:52", "he is samurai sword sharp yes sir", "73:55", "as opposed to having two years off one", "73:58", "one boxing fight in between them", "74:01", "and then such a grappling heavy contest", "74:04", "yeah I don't disagree that would be a", "74:06", "trainer you know for me as a trainer", "74:08", "that would be the ideal but it'll be", "74:09", "hard to motivate him for that I think it", "74:11", "would be hard to motivate them and it's", "74:13", "it's not the you know it's not really", "74:14", "the UFC model it's there's obvious it", "74:16", "was gonna be though you know I mean it", "74:18", "was gonna be those anybody could tell", "74:20", "the UFC what time it is it's Connor W", "74:23", "time yeah anybody is the guy that can", "74:27", "say hey this is what I want I want a", "74:29", "fuckin tune-up fight I wanna I want a", "74:31", "tough guy he absolutely could yeah and", "74:34", "he absolutely wouldn't you know it was", "74:36", "like when he lost it he has one fight", "74:38", "yeah and backstage he was screaming and", "74:42", "shouting all the top brass epic in the", "74:45", "rematch at 170 as quick as possible i", "74:47", "man I'm in the background going please", "74:49", "don't they did you not see that fight", "74:52", "he's a terrifying individual right let's", "74:55", "get a 155 fight and and yeah yeah okay", "74:58", "maybe you meet him again but he was not", "75:00", "letting that go and four months later he", "75:02", "fought the the exact same guy over and", "75:04", "that's where he is right now with khabib", "75:06", "that's all and that's all I'm hearing", "75:08", "from you yeah well listen you could sell", "75:10", "it for sure especially with the fucking", "75:13", "chaos after the fight and you know just", "75:16", "keep Dylan dannis at home he's grounded", "75:20", "yeah so with what would you do", "75:24", "differently um like I said from it from", "75:27", "a strategy point of view and my number", "75:28", "one thing would be to be more to think", "75:30", "more offensively that we definitely had", "75:33", "opportunities to land shots and then", "75:34", "when Connor line shot you know you know", "75:36", "watch the Eddie fight back again it", "75:38", "doesn't take him a whole lot of shots", "75:39", "and he rarely misses you know even if", "75:42", "you look at strikes that didn't land", "75:44", "those strikes were for a reason they", "75:46", "were to see what way he holds his hands", "75:48", "he was like you know you still watch an", "75:50", "Anderson Silva back in the day and I", "75:51", "thought they were the you know they have", "75:52", "a similar kind of approach but this one", "75:55", "we just didn't seem to be landing and my", "75:57", "only when I looked back at the training", "75:58", "camp I did spend most of her time with a", "76:01", "defensive mindset and and I think that's", "76:04", "a mistake", "76:05", "but don't you think that a big part of", "76:06", "it also was that he had to be tired", "76:08", "because khabib is so such a mauler 100%", "76:12", "and they have some sort of in effect and", "76:14", "ability to land those shots yeah yeah", "76:16", "I'm sure I did and that was part of the", "76:19", "strategy for one and two you know if we", "76:21", "did end up on our backs was not to put a", "76:23", "massive amount of effort into getting up", "76:24", "just play guard and stay safe because", "76:27", "you know the next round starts on the", "76:28", "feet and tried to do damage there but", "76:30", "it's still tiring you know I'd you know", "76:32", "up Connor gets a hard time about as bad", "76:34", "as cardio all the time but who is could", "76:37", "be faced that didn't look like that", "76:38", "after two rounds I am Quinta I quit yeah", "76:41", "yeah I mean I was super impressed with", "76:44", "Ally Quinta in that fight especially", "76:46", "considering he came into that fight", "76:48", "looking for a third a three-round fight", "76:50", "I mean that was what he was trained for", "76:52", "right he was trained for a three-round", "76:53", "fight and it changes up and all the", "76:55", "sudden he's in a five-round fight for", "76:57", "the title fucking crazy", "76:58", "yeah crazy set of circumstances but it", "77:01", "almost makes you wonder and this is me", "77:04", "you could speak to this better than", "77:06", "anybody how much how much is too much", "77:09", "and in regard to training for a fight", "77:11", "like this", "77:12", "like maybe training for a three-round", "77:14", "fight is the way to go when you have to", "77:16", "fight a five-round fight so you're not", "77:18", "so fucking beat up by the time you get", "77:20", "to the fight if you already know how to", "77:22", "fight five rounds you've already done it", "77:24", "and if you're a guy like Connor has just", "77:25", "got so much experience in the game it", "77:28", "might be that it's like there's a point", "77:31", "of diminishing returns in terms of your", "77:33", "strength and conditioning and that guys", "77:35", "just go too far push too hard and just", "77:38", "don't have it when it comes to I mean", "77:40", "how many times have you seen a fighter", "77:42", "be over trained when they fight very", "77:46", "often definitely you know they've given", "77:48", "their best rounds in the gym and it's", "77:50", "very difficult well in those last two", "77:52", "weeks because anxiety is starting to", "77:53", "grow so you want to train harder right", "77:56", "you want to get one more sparring and", "77:57", "you want to ya know because the fights", "78:00", "coming it's almost like when you're back", "78:01", "in school and you're cramming for an", "78:03", "exam well it's the exams tomorrow I'm", "78:05", "gonna stay up all night studying right", "78:06", "you know I actually got me to college so", "78:08", "it worked so much but but I'm fighting", "78:11", "we got to do we got to do the opposite", "78:12", "we don't have it we gotta have a solid", "78:14", "taper off period and that is hard when", "78:16", "you're dealing with a 20-something year", "78:17", "old man and he's dealing with what's", "78:20", "what's coming around the corner so but", "78:22", "you know that's that's the trainer's job", "78:24", "you know how much did he taper off for", "78:25", "this fight", "78:26", "same as usually we have a better two", "78:28", "taper off period where we start bringing", "78:30", "it down he did out you did actually spar", "78:33", "even after that and you know we were", "78:37", "working very hard for this fight and the", "78:38", "limit you know somewhat limited period", "78:40", "of time so we did didn't taper off quite", "78:43", "the way we would normally do but roughly", "78:45", "two weeks if you want to do a rematch", "78:47", "and the UFC did grant agreement this is", "78:50", "obviously dependent upon how the Nevada", "78:53", "State Athletic Commission handles the", "78:55", "legal ramifications of him jumping out", "78:57", "of the cage attacking Dylan Danis a", "78:59", "subsequent brawl the chaos that ensued", "79:02", "visas I mean you're dealing with a lot", "79:06", "of legal shit in this fight that that", "79:08", "could hold things up I mean they held", "79:10", "both guys purses correct well he held", "79:12", "Habib's Connor got his yeah okay Connor", "79:14", "goes purse and could be between who the", "79:20", "fuck knows what's gonna happen with him", "79:21", "you know and yeah I hope they're they're", "79:24", "lenient on them and I'm not just so we", "79:26", "can get a rematch I mean I love watching", "79:28", "a fight first night and and I can I can", "79:32", "stretch myself to understand his", "79:33", "reaction yeah", "79:34", "I can stretch myself to I can't stretch", "79:36", "myself to understand the other guys", "79:38", "reactions on what they did yes leave", "79:41", "Egypt over the cage and he jumps lights", "79:43", "it's not the end of the who was the guy", "79:45", "that jumped in there was wearing red who", "79:47", "punched Connor yeah I'm not sure I think", "79:49", "that's his boxing coach but I'm guessing", "79:52", "he's a fighter he fights for the UFC in", "79:54", "the red okay there you go", "80:07", "I don't think it was either well like I", "80:11", "know is a different guy he was you know", "80:13", "he hit Gannon", "80:14", "yeah and a guy in a suit that I heard is", "80:15", "this Russian manager he hit Dylan either", "80:18", "way um actually in the cage when your", "80:21", "mind went in and hit him from behind", "80:22", "there yeah you know I can't I can't", "80:25", "understand that like I said for her babe", "80:27", "I didn't think it was you know it was", "80:29", "it's just it's almost it's such a", "80:32", "foolish thing to do because I think", "80:33", "today they already won yeah I know that", "80:35", "Dylan was talking shit he was angry but", "80:38", "well yeah she didn't say anything", "80:39", "because I heard a few people saying that", "80:41", "no I was", "80:41", "we slide Dylan I didn't see what he did", "80:43", "but I could hear so he didn't say", "80:45", "anything when I watched the back I seen", "80:46", "he kind of beckoned them on yeah you", "80:48", "know just stupid and the fight stuff but", "80:51", "it I didn't think it justified that", "80:54", "level of response and maybe there was", "80:55", "something else in the lead-up you know", "80:56", "Dylan is a bit of a troll online so", "80:59", "there was probably a bit of a buildup of", "81:01", "voter stuff but um yeah like I said it", "81:04", "wasn't that big a deal to me what happy", "81:06", "did yeah just really wasn't well there's", "81:09", "two ways of looking at it in terms of", "81:12", "like the trash talking and one way is", "81:15", "that man does that sell a fight I mean", "81:17", "it sells a fight mean Connors one of the", "81:19", "best ever at if not the best ever at", "81:21", "talking shit to opponents getting them", "81:23", "riled up I mean it is the reason why", "81:26", "Joe's a Aldo lost his composure and came", "81:28", "charging face-first at Connor I mean", "81:30", "you've got to think emotions played a", "81:32", "big part of that it wraps up your stress", "81:35", "it ramps up the fighters anxiety", "81:38", "anticipation and it ramps up the", "81:39", "pressure on them to win until and this", "81:42", "emotion that they're fighting with", "81:43", "fuck's up their judgement it just does", "81:46", "and it's a major tool that Tonner", "81:48", "that Conor uses and but on the other", "81:51", "hand people say well I'd like it when", "81:54", "fighters are respectful and this is one", "81:56", "of the things that could be saying this", "81:57", "this this sport should be about respect", "82:00", "you shouldn't be talking about someone's", "82:01", "family shouldn't be talking about", "82:03", "someone's religion you shouldn't be", "82:04", "talking about someone's country but you", "82:07", "know on the other hand that's one of the", "82:10", "reasons what Connor is so fucking huge", "82:12", "it's not just his results it's all the", "82:15", "other things that come along with it", "82:16", "it's the excitement that he generates", "82:18", "the shit-talking the who the fuck is", "82:20", "that guy like that kind of shit that's a", "82:22", "big part of who he is it's a part of who", "82:24", "he is as this cultural icon I mean it's", "82:27", "one of the reasons why people love them", "82:29", "I mean they don't just love his ability", "82:32", "inside the Octagon which is quite", "82:34", "substantial that they love the Swagger", "82:35", "they love when he comes in with rubber", "82:37", "arms and struts around the caves they", "82:40", "love all that shit they love all that", "82:42", "ship it's

some people hate it I'm", "82:55", "really died interesting people's", "82:56", "opinions on things I'm just interested", "82:58", "in what is and what is that sells fights", "83:02", "yeah you know there's a reason he's the", "83:03", "highest-paid guy and so if that is what", "83:07", "is and that's just natural for him to do", "83:08", "as well it's not an act it's not you", "83:11", "know when he's sparring like I him an", "83:12", "hour to my best of friends and every", "83:14", "single Sparty should talk eat your shit", "83:16", "today you know I'm forum today and you", "83:19", "know people listen to them like whoa", "83:20", "they hate each other and then it's big", "83:21", "smiles at the end of it it's just part", "83:23", "of the game for him it's part he enjoys", "83:25", "it it's a bit of fun", "83:27", "this one was darker you know as Dana", "83:30", "said it definitely was but it's just", "83:32", "part of who he is I don't really involve", "83:33", "myself in it I tried to stay outside of", "83:37", "that and then just focus on the task", "83:38", "analysis you never get cringy for you", "83:41", "because you are a very respectful guy", "83:43", "yeah I

you can can I ever", "90:37", "be the exact guy no so you feel like", "90:40", "there's enough room for improvement that", "90:42", "if you could go back to the drawing", "90:43", "board and give yourself a few months", "90:45", "that you could get him to a point where", "90:47", "he'd have more success the day I don't", "90:49", "think that well I would quit you know", "90:51", "yeah so I'm completely biased and I'm I", "90:54", "absolutely think that if we could get", "90:55", "another shot at it and we can Conor", "90:57", "think so as well", "90:58", "absolutely what did what did Connor", "91:00", "think after the fight was over like What", "91:02", "did he say um crystal up he's very down", "91:08", "you know watching by he hates he hates", "91:11", "me hates technical mistakes about right", "91:12", "hand you know that that he was very", "91:15", "disappointed he got caught with a shot", "91:16", "like that but it's actually funny I was", "91:18", "just thinking about this you know that", "91:19", "right hand have you showed it to a", "91:20", "boxing coach you said that's horrible", "91:22", "you know your heads down you're sweet", "91:23", "yeah again I

them know your hands here go", "91:39", "straight comes back so you got to be", "91:41", "careful about the individual arts you", "91:42", "know you wouldn't high-level Olympic", "91:46", "boxing coach wouldn't teach a buta but", "91:47", "it's very effective Dan and", "91:49", "since careers that techne yeah so things", "91:52", "change though when you add in takedowns", "91:54", "right it's not weird at that yeah you", "91:57", "know it's a great it's a lovely part of", "91:59", "being a such a high-level grappler you", "92:00", "can go in and swing crazy you know kinda", "92:03", "has to go in be always worried about the", "92:05", "guy comin underneath is under needed", "92:07", "shots yeah so yeah things change as does", "92:10", "it's what makes the sport so interesting", "92:12", "yeah we made the comparison between", "92:14", "Kevin Randleman when he fought Mirko Cro", "92:16", "Cop that cro cop was so worried about", "92:19", "the takedown random and comes with a big", "92:20", "punch and knocks mouth yeah it was a", "92:22", "similar yeah set of circumstances kind", "92:25", "of recovered very very quickly but he's", "92:27", "got a hell of a chin yes he does yeah", "92:29", "he's he's rarely he's really hit and", "92:32", "that's of course kept his chin strong", "92:34", "because it does diminish you know yes", "92:36", "he's 15 years sparring almost daily you", "92:40", "know if he didn't have that style of", "92:43", "being elusive if he was a war gym war", "92:46", "guy he wouldn't be able to do his head", "92:48", "you know how hard does he spar well it's", "92:52", "a little bit depended on who were", "92:54", "against if I brought in a sparring", "92:55", "partner it's like a fight you know it's", "92:58", "gonna be like a fight he's looking to", "92:59", "finish if it's a training partner the", "93:02", "team mate we're probably doing about a", "93:05", "lower level and if you bring in someone", "93:08", "there's no pocket area they're ready", "93:09", "they've got to be ready I tell them well", "93:11", "I'll say it and I say two teams one he's", "93:14", "gonna talk to you", "93:15", "don't take it personal this is Harry", "93:17", "lives where and two it's gonna be a", "93:19", "fight so protect yourself be ready no I", "93:22", "referee and I'll be quick to to step in", "93:24", "but we have to do this we have to get a", "93:27", "level of training that's gonna match the", "93:29", "intensity of a contest right um you", "93:32", "gonna do that all the time no you know", "93:33", "that's that's only in at a certain", "93:36", "period of the training camp and it's", "93:38", "only going to be for us it's once every", "93:41", "for once every eight days is kind of", "93:42", "depending on how the Spira went and how", "93:43", "the body is the more of that we can do", "93:46", "it the better because it more directly", "93:48", "correlates to what we're actually gonna", "93:49", "do but then again you've got to be", "93:52", "matched against well if he was a gym war", "93:54", "type guy I'd have to pull back his sperm", "93:56", "because he'd taken too many shots", "93:57", "Brian Karl could go training camp Rove", "93:59", "being hit and he's just he's so elusive", "94:02", "okay so good at judging range and and so", "94:05", "on so for him you conspire all the time", "94:06", "you know it's like you I think another", "94:09", "example that maybe Darren till he's he's", "94:11", "the top dog in the gym so he can spare", "94:12", "all day long because he's never accepts", "94:14", "in damage right but if you're number ten", "94:16", "in the gym you probably should inspire", "94:17", "all the time", "94:18", "you're taking the shot for him", "94:21", "particularly he loves fighting he love", "94:23", "sparring absolutely his favorite part of", "94:25", "training you do that seven days a week", "94:26", "of eleven he you know he trains together", "94:29", "areas but is there's always the glint in", "94:31", "the eye when it's what's today", "94:33", "sparring oh here we go how do you decide", "94:35", "do it do you have a set schedule or do", "94:38", "you yeah yeah yeah so we do things in", "94:42", "cycles and we it will vary up for him", "94:46", "but it's roughly on an eight an eight", "94:48", "day cycle that I do with him and day one", "94:51", "and day 4 will be will be sparring again", "94:54", "a little bit depending on where the way", "94:55", "it is and how the last spiral went and", "94:57", "how he's feeling but if I can get that", "94:59", "out and that's that's what I aim for now", "95:02", "when you train for the mayweather fight", "95:04", "what first of all how much time did you", "95:06", "have to prepare for them ten weeks to", "95:08", "the day that doesn't seem like a lot no", "95:10", "no I remember just getting the getting", "95:13", "the message do you think that that was", "95:15", "calculated on Floyd's part maybe he's a", "95:18", "very smart guy because it seems like", "95:20", "most of his fights are planned way in", "95:21", "advance yeah that one was like what it's", "95:24", "a couple months away just just sort of", "95:26", "happened yeah yeah it was was it August", "95:27", "is that when the fight took place and it", "95:29", "was August talked yeah and so I remember", "95:31", "hearing about it and thinking like wait", "95:32", "wait August", "95:34", "that's fucking really close right right", "95:36", "for a Mayweather fight you would think", "95:38", "six we are six months or something along", "95:41", "those lines but I would feel like for", "95:44", "Floyd is as great as he is and probably", "95:47", "the best ever in terms of boxing", "95:49", "technique and not being hit I mean so", "95:51", "elusive still really wouldn't want a guy", "95:53", "like Connor preparing for a long period", "95:56", "of time a really getting acclimated yeah", "95:58", "yeah it was kind of funny how that all", "96:01", "came about because when he fought Eddie", "96:03", "in November the year before I remember", "96:06", "shortly after that we were out of", "96:08", "function and I kind of pulled him aside", "96:09", "and they I shook his hand I said right", "96:11", "you're done", "96:12", "all the best enjoy the rest of your life", "96:15", "was kind of shocked over saying this", "96:17", "somebody said what's he going to do you", "96:19", "you're the to a champion you've you've", "96:21", "got out the other end of this grind this", "96:24", "is this meat grinder with no damage you", "96:26", "you're in a very small percentage and", "96:28", "you've made plenty money often enjoy", "96:30", "yourself and then Tommy my past couple", "96:33", "of months my past and then this to me", "96:35", "with her fights they're talking and I", "96:38", "could I could understand it because now", "96:41", "his grandkids were gonna be financially", "96:43", "secure so it made sense because it was a", "96:45", "big payday didn't really make sense for", "96:47", "and you had a reason he enjoyed it the", "96:49", "competition side of it that's no matter", "96:51", "what you're doing with Conor is gonna be", "96:52", "competition I don't care what it is he's", "96:54", "gonna look how quick did you do that", "96:56", "you're like I went for a piss yeah I'll", "96:58", "do a quicker yeah he's just that way so", "97:00", "whenever I'd start having a bit of a", "97:02", "back-and-forth he's like yeah okay let's", "97:03", "quit the boxing and be the best boxer in", "97:05", "the world and for me my set you know I", "97:07", "was on the outside going okay I", "97:08", "understand what you know that makes", "97:10", "sense to do nothing else was really", "97:11", "making sense at the time", "97:12", "it's gonna be damaging boxing is a", "97:15", "horrendous sport to prepare for and to", "97:17", "compete in because we're just looking at", "97:20", "one thing really punches to the head you", "97:21", "know of course the body shots as well", "97:23", "but but it's it's so damaging the only", "97:26", "justification I could see for that was", "97:27", "you know your grandkids are financially", "97:30", "set yeah tremendous tremendous height", "97:32", "behind a tremendous amount of money did", "97:35", "you think you could win of course I'm", "97:38", "always

first time ever seen him against", "98:01", "a recognized boxer it was in the gym we", "98:04", "have locally happened in those sparring", "98:07", "sessions because what we got to see the", "98:08",
