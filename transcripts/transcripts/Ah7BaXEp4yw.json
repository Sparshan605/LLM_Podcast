["00:00", "hello freak bitches so so the reason I", "00:04", "the reason I think a guy like that gets", "00:06", "that good especially so quick is because", "00:09", "he doesn't have a favorite part he", "00:11", "doesn't have like he loves the whole", "00:13", "thing hmm you know you know you know", "00:15", "those guys that they're good strikers", "00:17", "and they love striking so that's what", "00:18", "they want to do all the time like no he", "00:21", "works on everything because for his", "00:23", "offense to be as good and his defense to", "00:25", "be just as good a lot of guys just want", "00:28", "to be offensive guys just want to win in", "00:30", "the gym guys want to get on top and they", "00:31", "want to stay there they want to control", "00:33", "mm-hmm", "00:33", "so when those guys get put on their back", "00:35", "they don't really know what to do", "00:37", "or they have a much harder time escaping", "00:39", "or transitioning out of that position", "00:40", "but not a guy like that though those are", "00:43", "the best guys in the world you look at", "00:45", "you look at DJ you look at DOM I mean", "00:47", "even Conor right the Nate fight is a bad", "00:51", "example because that was the first time", "00:54", "he was in a fight in the UFC and and he", "00:56", "didn't like it the second time he did", "00:57", "better but the same thing with Chad it's", "00:59", "a little bit of a fight he was in with", "01:01", "Mendes when he was on his back he did", "01:03", "some work got back through his feet he", "01:05", "wasn't so uncomfortable", "01:08", "with with a dominant wrestler like that", "01:10", "on top that he wasn't gonna be able to", "01:12", "get back up", "01:13", "yeah well Conor is is definitely", "01:16", "evolving you know you could definitely", "01:18", "tell that he's uh did like especially", "01:21", "his approach to the second Nate Diaz", "01:23", "fight he fought that fight very smart", "01:25", "and he survived some moments where it", "01:28", "looks like he was gassing out or at", "01:29", "least you got that opportunity to reset", "01:32", "if he wasn't gassing out he's definitely", "01:33", "diminished but he managed it he managed", "01:36", "it much better than the first time", "01:38", "because I mean when he got in trouble", "01:39", "that first time yeah he did try to", "01:42", "change the game but when it wasn't in", "01:44", "his favor it was like I kind of want out", "01:47", "of here this spirit I mean as a fighter", "01:49", "I look at that and I'm like his spirit", "01:51", "kind of broke there but he asked for", "01:53", "that fight again and then he did it", "01:54", "again and he did run into some trouble", "01:56", "and he improved he fought through it the", "02:00", "second time he didn't he wasn't like oh", "02:02", "this is a real fight now I gotta get out", "02:05", "of here no he was like I'm staying right", "02:06", "here so I'm excited to see that Conor", "02:09", "fight Eddie because I mean yeah", "02:13", "Nate is the same kind of guy he's not", "02:15", "gonna worry about those kind of things", "02:17", "but like Eddie is a different beast", "02:20", "Eddie's that Philly beast he's a savage", "02:22", "so I want to see I want to see them get", "02:24", "into a fight like it easily happen - it", "02:27", "could easily happen", "02:28", "Eddie opera is the fucking Savage yeah", "02:31", "he really is he wants that Rafael dos", "02:34", "Anjos stoppage holy shit the combination", "02:37", "he hit him with I mean and the the this", "02:40", "the sheer amount of punches he threw the", "02:43", "barrage that it took to put him away I", "02:45", "mean he had some fuckin serious", "02:48", "endurance to press the pace like that", "02:51", "that's the one thing that Conor has been", "02:53", "struggling with right yeah yeah with", "02:56", "that pace and endurance and and Eddie", "02:59", "has the power to put that pace on and", "03:02", "when when Nate gets him tired or gets", "03:04", "him hurt on his feet he's got that power", "03:06", "and it's not as dynamic he's he's a very", "03:09", "strong guy - look he's a very strong guy", "03:12", "for 155 I'm curious actually to see what", "03:17", "Connor looks like at 55 because right we", "03:19", "haven't seen him there in the UFC we've", "03:22", "seen 45 and you've seen him cut no wait", "03:24", "and wait like 169 I think he weighed", "03:27", "against Nate it would be interesting to", "03:30", "see what does Connor look like when he's", "03:32", "at 155 I mean that might be the perfect", "03:34", "weight for him it's an entirely possible", "03:36", "we might see a better McGregor at 155 I", "03:39", "think that's the deepest division yeah I", "03:42", "think it has been for the longest time", "03:43", "and that if anybody dominates that", "03:47", "division like RDA did it for a little", "03:49", "look dominant for a little bit um even", "03:52", "coming up to the title fight he looked", "03:54", "like he was gonna hold on to that for a", "03:56", "while um but everybody they're so close", "03:59", "everybody at that weight class is so", "04:01", "close so if somebody does it", "04:04", "what about nurmagomedov because he", "04:06", "rag-dolled", "04:07", "everybody he's gotten in there with", "04:09", "that's the one guy you can't say it's", "04:10", "close with because everybody he's got", "04:12", "ahold of he's beating the fuck out of", "04:14", "that guys special at that office special", "04:17", "that's true I like I like that guy", "04:20", "because what you said he's special", "04:23", "right and when you see that special", "04:25", "thing then", "04:26", "I guess people kind of get lost in the", "04:28", "void when everybody's close to being", "04:30", "just as good as each other", "04:31", "then you kind of just fight to get just", "04:33", "a little bit better than the other guy", "04:35", "just a little bit better than the other", "04:36", "I just got to be better than him but", "04:38", "then when you get the John Jones that", "04:39", "comes into the arena and he's she's", "04:42", "leaps and bounds ahead of everybody else", "04:44", "then you realize there's a bigger gap", "04:46", "and guys start closing that right like", "04:49", "Alice a link Alexandre Gusterson I mean", "04:52", "he always fights at that level", "04:54", "especially when he's in a title fight", "04:55", "but I don't know if John Jones didn't", "04:59", "exist if he would rise to that occasion", "05:01", "hmm no I mean hmm so somebody's got to", "05:05", "show up in the lightweight division at", "05:07", "some point like that to to make people", "05:10", "raise their level because guys right now", "05:13", "which is the deepest and toughest", "05:14", "division but guys are so close and maybe", "05:17", "tomorrow matter of is that guy hmm", "05:20", "well he certainly has been in when it", "05:22", "comes to grappling like what he did to", "05:24", "dos Anjos was it was pretty stunning you", "05:27", "know because I was like man dos Anjos is", "05:29", "a legit Brazilian jiu-jitsu blackbelt", "05:31", "super strong guy really good on the", "05:33", "ground and it just seemed like", "05:35", "nurmagomedov just got a hold of them and", "05:37", "just did whatever the fuck you wanted to", "05:39", "once he got him on the ground just", "05:40", "throws dudes around it's almost like", "05:42", "he's built different but he doesn't you", "05:44", "know like if Gleason T bow was doing", "05:46", "that to dudes I'd go I that make sense", "05:49", "look at that fuckin guy but when", "05:50", "nurmagomedov does it it's not", "05:53", "necessarily just some overwhelming", "05:54", "physical attribute it's his technique", "05:57", "and his aggression just just super", "06:01", "fuckin aggressive and tight with his", "06:03", "grappling and his positioning his", "06:04", "ground-and-pound is horrific he's a", "06:07", "scary dude man he doesn't he doesn't", "06:10", "even have to think about the way he does", "06:11", "those moves I remember when you said", "06:13", "that when you say rag dolling people are", "06:15", "da rd8 took that shot on him and he's in", "06:18", "the third and he hit him with it ooh", "06:21", "tamata basically from the over hook", "06:23", "Whizzer and tripped him forcing it and", "06:25", "that's not easy throw to hit and", "06:27", "especially from that range it didn't", "06:29", "look like it was gonna happen but he", "06:30", "does it to the guy who goes on and", "06:33", "become the world champion that way and", "06:35", "then dominates other guys at that weight", "06:36", "class yeah like that guy special man I", "06:39", "want to see", "06:40", "want to see him improve his stand up and", "06:41", "get and get and just get better I want", "06:43", "to see him do things like DJ is you know", "06:45", "just working on his weaknesses and cuz I", "06:49", "mean that guy would never lose imagine", "06:55", "if he had DJ's MMA IQ and skill set but", "07:00", "his rest went with his ret what his", "07:01", "wrestling and ground is now like who's", "07:04", "beating that guy I would send that guy", "07:06", "to fight wars for me yeah man look he's", "07:12", "here AG dolls dudes in a very unusual", "07:14", "way do every now and then a guy will", "07:16", "come up like that that can do that and", "07:18", "he does it with like this intensity and", "07:20", "aggression like Demian Maia ragdolls a", "07:23", "lot of people too especially lately he", "07:25", "gets a hold of guys like you did with", "07:27", "Rick story but he's doing it in like", "07:29", "this", "07:30", "technical squeezy way you know when", "07:33", "Norma Granof gets all the dudes it's", "07:35", "just smash everything smash he's driving", "07:38", "you into the ground smashing you into", "07:40", "the ground", "07:41", "and smashing when you're on top of you", "07:42", "Demian Maia is just constricting he's", "07:45", "like moving into position and he's", "07:47", "slowly closing you off and he's gonna", "07:49", "choke you it's a totally different kind", "07:51", "of domination but then I don't know if", "07:55", "it's entirely the fairest comparison", "07:56", "because Damien is obviously for a much", "07:58", "longer career and he fought at 185 and", "08:01", "he fought again it's against Anderson he", "08:03", "got knocked out by Nate he's had a lot", "08:05", "of ups and downs in the UFC Jake Shields", "08:08", "beat him people forget that Jake Shields", "08:10", "essentially out grappled him but never", "08:14", "come in off good luck good luck helped", "08:16", "grapple in that dude good luck good but", "08:20", "what's his was it takedown percentage", "08:21", "like two it's probably a million percent", "08:24", "I mean it's done everybody but the other", "08:27", "thing about nurmagomedov is then he gets", "08:30", "injured a lot yeah and you got a wonder", "08:33", "is it because of that insane fucking", "08:36", "aggressive style of his that so makes it", "08:38", "so fun to watch them is that like you're", "08:41", "kind of redlining your body too much", "08:44", "probably yeah right yeah yeah I mean you", "08:49", "got a rest right you gotta feel up you", "08:51", "can't always be on yeah but I mean can a", "08:54", "guide like a Demian Maia who trains very", "08:57", "technically I mean obviously he wrestles", "09:00", "and he does like a lot of chaotic", "09:01", "movements as well but probably not", "09:03", "nearly with the kind of intensity that", "09:05", "Nurik meant off does you got a wonder", "09:08", "like that style is obviously super", "09:11", "effective and very fucking devastating", "09:13", "and fun to watch but I wonder if", "09:16", "preparing for that style and executing", "09:18", "that style is almost like ultimately too", "09:20", "much on your joints too much on your", "09:22", "body I guess the question would be then", "09:26", "is can he be no Magomedov without that", "09:31", "style right like does he have the skill", "09:33", "to translate that to slowing it down and", "09:36", "and turning the volume down", "09:43", "[Music]", "English (auto-generated)"]
