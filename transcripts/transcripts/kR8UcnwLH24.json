clean", "67:18", "all the crap out of the pipes and create", "67:20", "this false conclusion that somehow the", "67:23", "water is clean when the people who live", "67:24", "there know that it is

been", "68:27", "going now for the last several years is", "68:29", "a lie it's just not true", "68:32", "when you talk about people that are", "68:33", "working full-time jobs and they still", "68:35", "don't have enough money to get by what", "68:37", "could you do to change that I think", "68:40", "there's a we there's not one single", "68:43", "action that can fix that", "68:46", "you know I'm pushing for a living wage I", "68:48", "think it's important that what do you", "68:49", "think that should be it's it's gonna be", "68:51", "different in different places you know", "68:53", "I've I'm a co-sponsor of the", "68:55", "Congressional legislation to raise the", "68:57", "minimum wage to $15 at the federal level", "69:01", "you know there has not been an increase", "69:03", "in the federal minimum wage for a very", "69:05", "long time and I think that's that's a", "69:08", "step that can be taken but you know Los", "69:10", "Angeles is like Hawaii where a $15 an", "69:14", "hour job is not gonna be enough to pay", "69:16", "the rent you got high cost of living so", "69:18", "a living wage is gonna be higher and in", "69:20", "communities like ours than it is in", "69:22", "smaller communities or in West what", "69:25", "would you suggest for Los Angeles $20 an", "69:27", "hour I don't I don't know what the", "69:28", "answer is here it would have to be more", "69:30", "I think so the argument against that", "69:32", "would be that small businesses would go", "69:34", "under or hire less people or that", "69:37", "somehow another it would be bad for", "69:38", "business", "69:39", "I think there's a you know I mean the", "69:41", "cost of living here is higher and so", "69:44", "what we are paying the employees who", "69:46", "work in these industries and these", "69:47", "service jobs has to match that it has to", "69:50", "correlate with that higher cost of", "69:52", "living it cost more to go out to eat", "69:53", "here than it does to go out to eat in a", "69:56", "restaurant in I don't know Alabama for", "69:59", "example so I think we've got a we've got", "70:01", "to recognize people who are doing the", "70:02", "work that correlates with the higher", "70:05", "cost of living that we're seeing already", "70:07", "I'm really looking at the universal", "70:10", "basic income and seeing how that could", "70:13", "be a tool to", "70:15", "help deal with a lot of these", "70:17", "poverty-stricken communities and people", "70:19", "who have been struggling and still", "70:20", "unable to dig themselves out of a hole", "70:22", "there and seeing how that potentially", "70:25", "could replace a lot of the bureaucracy a", "70:28", "lot of the money that we're spending on", "70:30", "bureaucracy and a lot of social welfare", "70:32", "programs perhaps to both save money and", "70:35", "to provide support directly to people", "70:37", "who need it so I think that's an option", "70:39", "that we've got to consider there's it's", "70:41", "it's not simple and so I'm doing the", "70:43", "research and figuring out how exactly", "70:45", "that would work and how exactly we'd pay", "70:47", "for it but we also have to look at", "70:49", "affordable housing I think not accepting", "70:51", "the fact that the high cost of housing", "70:53", "is what it is is is not the solution", "70:58", "there's a lot of money that goes into", "71:00", "our Housing and Urban Development", "71:02", "Department but is it really having the", "71:05", "effect that we needed to have to make it", "71:06", "so that you know whether it's cops or", "71:08", "teachers or firefighters people who are", "71:10", "working these public service jobs are", "71:12", "able to afford to live and live in the", "71:13", "communities where they're working we", "71:16", "were in Malibu yesterday we had a town", "71:18", "hall there yesterday and took a tour", "71:20", "with the mayor City Council members", "71:21", "community leaders around a lot of the", "71:23", "areas that were completely devastated by", "71:26", "the fires and that was one of the things", "71:29", "that they mentioned is that they pointed", "71:31", "out a trailer-park traditionally where a", "71:35", "lot of those first responders live", "71:37", "that's where the workforce in Malibu", "71:39", "have lived in that trailer park and they", "71:42", "said that it's not unheard of that one", "71:45", "of those trailer homes go for a million", "71:48", "bucks a million bucks and you don't even", "71:50", "get to own the land that your trailer", "71:52", "sits on and so this is a real problem", "71:54", "that they're facing is people who are", "71:56", "teaching in that area the firefighters", "71:57", "who are working in that area they're not", "71:59", "able to afford to live in the community", "72:01", "that they serve but how could that be", "72:03", "fixed that's a supply and demand thing", "72:05", "they're zombies I mean you know there's", "72:09", "there's land in the valleys and other", "72:11", "areas but some communities are dealing", "72:13", "with this both in the private sector", "72:15", "there's there's hotels in Hawaii for", "72:17", "example who are recognizing that they", "72:19", "can't attract workers to work in the", "72:21", "hotels because they can't afford to live", "72:23", "near where they work and they're", "72:25", "starting to buy up properties to", "72:26", "actually provide that workforce how", "72:29", "at an affordable cost to be able to", "72:31", "attract those workers some communities", "72:33", "are doing the same thing for for first", "72:36", "responders for firefighters and others", "72:38", "so this is a problem that that a lot of", "72:40", "you know City Council's and local", "72:42", "communities are trying to deal with and", "72:44", "solve but I think it also points to a", "72:46", "bigger problem that we have nationally", "72:50", "that there is

it's", "108:49", "like it's a fantastic speech I'll check", "108:52", "it out", "108:53", "but this has always been the real", "108:56", "concern that people have that when you", "109:00", "give someone the ability to surveil the", "109:03", "general population when you give", "109:05", "something they're going to use some of", "109:06", "that information to aid in their allies", "109:09",

that Andrew", "121:34", "yang has built this whole platform on", "121:35", "Elon Musk has talked extensively about", "121:38", "it we are in a situation where there was", "121:40", "an article today

to start taking over many non", "121:55", "skilled jobs and this is true with the", "121:59", "travel industry with trucking with", "122:01", "moving things shipping that we are going", "122:04", "to

help train folks for for", "123:05", "jobs that pay more money and and", "123:08", "hopefully help offer a better quality of", "123:11", "life and I think that's overall when we", "123:13", "look at this I think that's that's the", "123:16", "way that we should be addressing this is", "123:18", "not just a job as a job as a job as a", "123:21", "job you know but really looking at the", "123:23", "quality of life of people in this", "123:25", "country that a job does not equal", "123:28", "happiness or fulfillment but really look", "123:33", "you know parents who have a child and", "123:36",

yeah", "124:21", "and that hath erm brakes yeah yeah time", "124:23", "limits yeah you know this is part of the", "124:26", "problem with", "124:29", "the idea that companies are supposed to", "124:32", "constantly make more and more money yeah", "124:34", "as you get ruthlessly competitive people", "124:36", "looking at the bottom line in every", "124:38", "single aspect of that business

they have to find a", "124:50", "way to justify their position in the", "124:52", "company yeah and so they get paid very", "124:54", "little they work very hard yeah and a", "124:56", "company like Amazon paying not only", "125:00", "paying no taxes but I think this is for", "125:02", "the third year in a row yeah and also", "125:04", "getting I think this last year was over", "125:06", "a

"125:16", "wife and write the whole thing is", "125:18", "ridiculous I mean it's what people who", "125:21", "leaned socialist point to when they talk", "125:24", "about unchecked capitalism without any", "125:26", "sort of regulation that can stop", "125:29", "something like that from happening and", "125:31", "stop workers from being exploited in", "125:33", "that way yes just and people say

"126:15", "they're barely making minimum wage it's", "126:16", "crazy I mean so that's where I think you", "126:20", "know is is and looked at this automation", "126:23", "really changing our economy is something", "126:26", "that that I think we're behind the curve", "126:28", "ball on because it's already happening", "126:30", "but let's try to see the opportunity in", "126:33", "that where if

"135:24", "yeah with these piloted things that what", "135:28", "you're gonna have is autonomous yep", "135:30", "weapons in the future where you're just", "135:32", "going to be able to literally release", "135:33", "killer robots I'm very concerned about", "135:36", "artificial intelligence and how quickly", "135:39", "this technology is evolving with very", "135:43", "little", "135:46",

"136:11", "Attica spiraling out of control in", "136:12", "particular what could we do to stop", "136:15", "autonomous weapons so what a lot of", "136:18", "people are really concerned with did you", "136:19", "watch that show black mirror mm-hmm it's", "136:21", "a great show it's on Netflix but a lot", "136:23", "of it is dystopian stories about the", "136:25", "future and one of them is called heavy", "136:27", "metal and it's about this woman being", "136:29", "chased by these little intelligent", "136:31", "robots that are trying to kill her", "136:32", "yeah it's terrifying because this is", "136:34", "something that could be implemented in", "136:36", "the battlefield yeah and we could have", "136:39", "if we don't do it first we could have a", "136:41", "situation where our soldiers are in some", "136:44", "sort of a situation facing off against", "136:47", "robots yeah it sounds like a", "136:48", "science-fiction movie but it's not that", "136:50", "far away from reality yeah I think this", "136:53", "is one of those things that of leaders", "136:56", "in the global community have to", "136:58", "recognize that some some kind just just", "137:01", "like with nuclear the nuclear arms race", "137:03", "once you start on this race I mean there", "137:06", "are no winners in a nuclear war", "137:08", "everybody loses in that scenario and I", "137:12", "think there's a similar approach that", "137:14", "needs to be taken to the dangers of", "137:17", "artificial intelligence being weaponized", "137:20", "and coming together as a kind of a", "137:22", "global community to say hey this is", "137:24", "something that indane could potentially", "137:26", "if put in the wrong hands and danger all", "137:29", "of us and find the best approach to deal", "137:33", "with that because my concern is as we", "137:36", "see with so many of these other weapon", "137:38", "systems if it's just one country that's", "137:41", "doing it then you have well my gosh if", "137:43", "everyone else is weaponizing but we're", "137:45", "the only ones who are doing the right", "137:47", "thing then is that creating a situation", "137:49", "where our national security is at risk", "137:51", "or our troops are at risk so I think", "137:54", "it's one of those things that you know", "137:56", "that this world is a small place", "137:58", "and we would have a shared interest with", "138:01", "leaders of other countries in the world", "138:02", "to provide the right kinds of checks and", "138:05", "balances on this technology so that it", "138:09", "doesn't become something that's a danger", "138:10", "to humanity and the real fear would be", "138:13", "that someone would not think that at all", "138:16", "yeah that there would be whatever", "138:18", "country figure out what the country is", "138:19", "it's some country like fuck you we're", "138:21", "gonna do whatever we want we're look you", "138:23", "guys took over this world because of", "138:24", "nuclear power we're gonna take over this", "138:25", "world because of autonomous weapons and", "138:27", "artificial intelligence yeah and we're", "138:29", "gonna design it to go kill Americans", "138:31", "yeah I think that that's why it's", "138:32", "important that we take that we take a", "138:35", "global approach to this you know and", "138:37", "because otherwise I think you do you end", "138:39", "up with that scenario and where you just", "138:42", "you know this race begins and then", "138:43", "there's no way to stop it and it's too", "138:45", "late unlike China the United States has", "138:49", "at least in perception a clear", "138:53", "differentiation between business and", "138:56", "government mhm and one of the concerns", "139:00", "that I want to talk to experts in China", "139:04", "and their electronics and their their", "139:07", "technological innovation is that they're", "139:08", "inexorably connected to the government", "139:11", "yeah some way shape or form and that", "139:13", "it's one of the main reasons that makes", "139:16", "it incredibly difficult to compete with", "139:17", "them on a global marketplace yeah when", "139:20", "you see that this our State Department", "139:23", "has told people to stop using Huawei", "139:25", "devices because Huawei which is the", "139:27", "number-two provider of cell phones in", "139:29", "this world now they're connected to the", "139:32", "Chinese government like how do you take", "139:34", "that what what what do you do about that", "139:37", "situation and that relationship between", "139:40", "your private sector and government in", "139:42", "particular with the competition that", "139:44", "what look when it comes to data we're", "139:47", "very concerned about people sharing data", "139:48", "we've we've done it ourselves we've", "139:50", "Spyder and we've proven through the", "139:52", "Edward Snowden case our government's", "139:54", "doing as well to us we're worried the", "139:56", "Chinese are doing it to us or so we're", "139:58", "saying don't buy Chinese stuff they're", "140:00", "gonna steal your data and steal your", "140:01", "information and steal your your business", "140:03", "secrets yeah what can you do to stop", "140:05", "that what can you do to mitigate what's", "140:07", "already happened", "140:09", "like you know ultimately you can't stop", "140:11", "every single individual with what", "140:13", "they're purchasing I think that you know", "140:16", "you can regulate what is sold here in", "140:19", "the United States I think there's a role", "140:22", "that government can play especially as", "140:23", "we're talking about artificial", "140:24", "intelligence and that kind of technology", "140:26", "again first in

"141:12", "that's combined inexorably with the", "141:14", "military and that they have much more", "141:16", "influence over what gets done and how", "141:18", "things get done what did you pay",

a society need to do better at and", "152:21", "the third thing I'll say is we've got to", "152:23", "go after the culprits responsible for", "152:26", "this when you look at companies like",
