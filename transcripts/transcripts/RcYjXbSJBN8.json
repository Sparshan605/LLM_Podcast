["00:00", "welcome back here we go again great to", "00:03", "see you and congratulations", "00:04", "thank you you will never forget what is", "00:07", "going on in the world when you think", "00:09", "about when your child is born you will", "00:11", "know for the rest of this child's life", "00:12", "you were born during a weird time that's", "00:16", "for sure no that is for sure", "00:18", "they're probably the weirdest that I can", "00:21", "remember yeah yeah and he was born on", "00:24", "may the 4th and that's lairs - yeah", "00:27", "William has to be hopeful I sure hope so", "00:31", "perfect yes I mean that was the perfect", "00:32", "day for you I'm yeah what how do you say", "00:36", "the name well uh there's a placeholder", "00:40", "and first of all my partner's the one", "00:42", "that actually mostly came up with the", "00:44", "name congratulations to her yeah yeah", "00:46", "she's great at names so I mean it's just", "00:49", "X the letter X and then the AE is like", "00:55", "pronounced ash yeah and then a 12 a 12", "01:02", "is my contribution o ye 12 Archangel 12", "01:06", "the precursor to the sr-71 coolest plane", "01:09", "ever I I agree with you I don't know I'm", "01:14", "not familiar with it I know one is yeah", "01:17", "yeah yeah I know what that is the sr-71", "01:19", "came from a CIA program called a cold", "01:21", "Archangel oh it's the Archangel project", "01:24", "and then Archangel 12 wow what a dope", "01:26", "looking plane yeah oh okay I got it", "01:29", "yeah well as a person who's very much", "01:32", "into aerial travel as you are well", "01:35", "that's perfect it's pretty great", "01:37", "yeah pretty great so is it does it feel", "01:40", "strange to have a child while this", "01:43", "craziness is going does it feeling", "01:44", "you've had children before is this any", "01:46", "weirder it's actually I think it's", "01:50", "better being older and having a kid I", "01:54", "appreciate it more hmm yeah babies are", "01:58", "awesome they are pretty awesome they're", "02:00", "awesome yeah but I didn't have any of my", "02:02", "own I would see other people's kids and", "02:04", "I didn't not like that sure but I wasn't", "02:07", "drawn to them sure but now when I see", "02:09", "little people's kids I'm like oh I think", "02:11", "of a minute like these little love", "02:12", "packages yeah the love books", "02:13", "yeah it's just you think of them", "02:15", "differently when you see them come out", "02:17", "and then grow and then eventually start", "02:19", "talking to you like your whole idea what", "02:21", "a baby is is very different yeah so now", "02:24", "as you you know get older and get to", "02:26", "appreciate it as a mature fully formed", "02:28", "adult it must be really pretty wonderful", "02:32", "yeah wonderful that's great", "02:34", "but babies are awesome yeah yeah that's", "02:36", "uh that's great yeah I mean also have I", "02:42", "I've spent a lot of time on AI and", "02:44", "neural nets and so you can sort of see", "02:46", "then kind of the brain develop which is", "02:49", "you know what and they I know neural net", "02:52", "is trying to simulate what a brain does", "02:54", "basically and you can sort of see the it", "02:58", "learning very quickly you know it's just", "03:02", "wow see things fight so you're talking", "03:05", "about the neural net you're not talking", "03:06", "about an actual baby no right action an", "03:08", "actual baby well both of them yes but", "03:10", "the word neural that comes from the the", "03:13", "brain it's like a net of neurons so you", "03:17", "know it's like the yeah humans are the", "03:21", "you know yeah so when you're programming", "03:29", "artificial intelligence were you working", "03:32", "with artificial intelligence art are", "03:34", "they specifically trying to mimic the", "03:36", "developmental process of a human brain", "03:40", "in a lot of ways there's some ways that", "03:43", "are different yeah you're an analogy", "03:45", "that's often used is like you know we we", "03:47", "don't make a submarine swim like a fish", "03:50", "but we take the principles of how you", "03:54", "know what would hydrodynamics and", "03:56", "applied them to a submarine I've always", "03:59", "wondered as a layperson do you try to", "04:01", "achieve the same results as a human", "04:03", "brain but through different methods or", "04:04", "do you try to copy the way a human brain", "04:07", "achieves results I mean the essential", "04:11", "elements of an AI neural net are really", "04:16", "very very similar to a human brain", "04:18", "neural net yeah having the multiple", "04:22", "layers of neurons and", "04:25", "you had a backpropagation these all", "04:28", "these things are what your brain does", "04:29", "you know it's a yeah you have you have a", "04:34", "layer of neurons that goes through a", "04:35", "series of intermediate steps to", "04:36", "ultimately cognition and that and then", "04:39", "it'll reverse those steps go back and", "04:42", "forth and go all over the place", "04:44", "it's um yeah", "04:47", "it's interesting very interesting yeah I", "04:51", "would imagine like the thought of", "04:53", "programming something that is eventually", "04:56", "going to be smarter than us that one day", "04:58", "it's gonna be like why did you do it", "05:00", "that way like when artificial", "05:02", "intelligence sentient they're like oh", "05:04", "you tried to mimic yourself like this so", "05:07", "much better process cut out all this", "05:09", "nonsense", "05:10", "they're like so they're elements that", "05:12", "are the same but just looks like like an", "05:14", "aircraft does not fly like a bird right", "05:17", "yeah it doesn't flap its wings but the", "05:20", "wings the way the wings work and", "05:23", "generate lift is the same as bird now", "05:27", "you're in the middle of this this", "05:31", "strange time where you're selling your", "05:33", "houses you say you don't want any", "05:34", "material possessions and haven't seen", "05:37", "all that and I've been really excited to", "05:38", "talk to you about this yeah because it's", "05:39", "an interesting thing to come from a guy", "05:40", "like yourself like why are you doing", "05:43", "that I'm slightly sad about it actually", "05:45", "but look if you're sad about it why are", "05:49", "you doing it I think I think possessions", "05:55", "kind of weigh you down then they're kind", "05:59", "of an attack vector", "06:01", "you know you'll say hey billionaire you", "06:03", "got all this stuff like well I'm downer", "06:05", "stuff now what were you gonna do attack", "06:08", "vector meaning like people targeted yeah", "06:10", "mmm interesting yeah but you're", "06:14", "obviously gonna so you're gonna rent a", "06:15", "place yeah okay and get rid of", "06:19", "everything that's up close no I said", "06:21", "like almost everything so it's like keep", "06:24", "a couple Tesla's yeah house kind of have", "06:27", "to yeah that's product and stuff um yeah", "06:30", "there's things that have sentimental", "06:31", "value for sure keeping those here yeah", "06:37", "so do you feel like", "06:39", "is what's worse think it happen okay", "06:41", "fine yeah yeah you could always buy more", "06:43", "stuff if you don't like it supposed to", "06:45", "yeah I mean from the money that you sell", "06:47", "all your stuff you could buy new stuff", "06:49", "but do you feel like people define you", "06:53", "by the fact that you're you're wealthy", "06:56", "and that they define you in a pejorative", "06:58", "way for sure I mean not on your own but", "07:01", "right you know there's for sure in", "07:04", "recent like you wrote years billionaire", "07:06", "has become a her job you like it's in a", "07:08", "pejorative it's like it's like that's a", "07:10", "bad thing which I mean I think them", "07:13", "doesn't make a lot a lot of sense in", "07:14", "most cases if you if you've done if you", "07:17", "basically organized the company like", "07:22", "kind of how does this wealth arise it's", "07:24", "if you organize people in a in a better", "07:28", "way to produce products and services", "07:31", "that are better than what existed before", "07:33", "and you have some ownership in that", "07:36", "company then that that essentially gives", "07:39", "you the right to allocate more capital", "07:42", "so it is it's that there's a conflation", "07:44", "of consumption and capital allocation so", "07:49", "let me take Warren Buffett for example", "07:51", "and forget totally Frank I'm not his", "07:53", "biggest fan but minoo he does like", "07:57", "capital allocation and he reads a lot of", "08:00", "a lot of sort of annual reports of", "08:02", "companies and what will be counting and", "08:04", "it's pretty boring really", "08:05", "and he's trying to figure out is he does", "08:09", "Coke or Pepsi deserve more capital I", "08:11", "mean that's I mean it's kind of a boring", "08:14", "job if you ask me but you know it's", "08:18", "still a thing that's important to figure", "08:20", "out like which it is a company deserving", "08:22", "of more or less capital should that", "08:24", "company grow or expand is it making", "08:26", "parts and services that are better than", "08:28", "others or worse and you know should you", "08:32", "know if we kind of a company is making", "08:34", "compelling products and services it", "08:36", "should get more capital and if it's not", "08:38", "it should get less well got a business", "08:39", "well there's a big difference - between", "08:41", "someone who's making an incredible", "08:44", "amount of money designing and", "08:47", "engineering fantastic products versus", "08:49", "someone who's making an incredible", "08:51", "amount of money by", "08:53", "investing in companies or moving money", "08:55", "around the stock market or doing things", "08:57", "along those lines it's it's a different", "08:59", "thing and to put them all on the same", "09:00", "category seems it's it's very simple and", "09:04", "as you pointed out it's an attack vector", "09:06", "yeah for sure yeah I mean I think it's", "09:09", "really I I do think they're in the in", "09:13", "the United States especially there's an", "09:15", "over allocation of talent in finance and", "09:18", "law basically too many smart people go", "09:20", "into finance and law so you know this is", "09:25", "both a compliment and a criticism we", "09:28", "should have I think fewer people doing", "09:32", "law and fewer people are doing finance", "09:33", "and more people making stuff yeah yeah", "09:38", "well that would certainly be better for", "09:40", "all involved if they made better stuff", "09:42", "yeah yeah absolutely and and you know", "09:46", "manufacturing used to be highly valued", "09:48", "in in the United States and these days", "09:50", "it's not it's it's often looked down", "09:52", "upon which i think is wrong yeah well I", "09:55", "think that people are kind of learning", "09:58", "that particularly because of this whole", "10:01", "pandemic in this relationship that we", "10:03", "have with China that there's a lot of", "10:06", "value in to making things into making", "10:08", "things here yes somebody's got to do the", "10:11", "real work", "10:12", "yeah you know and you know like making", "10:16", "making a car it's an honest day's esthar", "10:19", "honest day's living that's for sure you", "10:21", "know or making anything really or", "10:23", "providing valuable service", "10:25", "like providing you know get our", "10:27", "entertainment get information that these", "10:28", "are all valuable things to do you know", "10:32", "so yeah it should be more more of it did", "10:36", "you have a moment where is this", "10:39", "something that this idea of getting rid", "10:40", "of your material possessions is", "10:41", "something that built up over time or did", "10:44", "you have a moment of realization where", "10:46", "you realize that yeah I've been thinking", "10:48", "about it for a while you know part of it", "10:52", "is like I like I have a bunch of houses", "10:55", "but I don't spend a lot of time in most", "10:59", "of them and that doesn't seem like a", "11:03", "good use of assets like somebody could", "11:05", "probably be in turn those", "11:06", "houses and get better than me so don't", "11:10", "you have Gene Wilder's house I do that's", "11:12", "amazing that's awesome Wow yes it's", "11:15", "exactly what you'd expect did you", "11:17", "request that the buyer not fuck it up", "11:19", "yeah that's a requirement a requirement", "11:21", "that's a good requirement yeah not in", "11:24", "that case in that house yeah it'll", "11:25", "probably sell fast but still I don't", "11:26", "care he's a legend", "11:28", "I want his soul you'd want his essence", "11:32", "yeah in the building it's and it's there", "11:34", "that's a real quick is it quickie house", "11:36", "yeah what what makes you say it's there", "11:38", "look what do you get out of it I mean", "11:44", "all the all the cabinets are like can't", "11:46", "handmade and they're like odd shapes and", "11:49", "there's like doors to nowhere and", "11:52", "strange like corridors and tunnels and", "11:56", "really odd odd paintings on the wall and", "12:00", "yeah did you ever live in it it's very", "12:02", "quirky yeah I did live in it briefly", "12:04", "yeah but why do you buy houses like if", "12:08", "you own all these houses do you just get", "12:09", "bored and go I think I'd like to have", "12:11", "that well I you know had one house and", "12:15", "then the gene Wilder house right across", "12:19", "the road from me from from my main house", "12:21", "and it was gonna get it was gonna get", "12:24", "sold and then torn down and turned into", "12:26", "you know be a big construction zone for", "12:28", "three years and I was like well I think", "12:31", "I'll buy it and preserve the spirit of", "12:35", "gene water and not have a giant", "12:37", "construction zone and then the you know", "12:42", "I started having like some privacy", "12:43", "issues where like people would like less", "12:46", "people like come to my house and you", "12:49", "know start climbing over the walls and", "12:52", "stuff I don't like man so then I started", "12:58", "like what a house some of the houses", "13:00", "around my house and then I thought at", "13:01", "one point well you know it'd be cool to", "13:04", "to build a house so then I acquired some", "13:09", "properties at the top of Samara Road and", "13:12", "which has got a great view and it's like", "13:15", "okay well these some bunch of sort of", "13:18", "small older houses", "13:19", "they're gonna get torn down anyway I was", "13:21", "like well you know like collect these", "13:23", "like little little houses then I can", "13:25", "build something you know I don't know", "13:28", "artistic like a you know dream house to", "13:32", "everything what's a dream house for Elon", "13:34", "Musk like some Tony Stark type shit yeah", "13:36", "definitely yeah you gotta have the dome", "13:40", "that opens up with the stealth", "13:42", "helicopter and that kind of thing you", "13:43", "know", "13:44", "yeah for sure fuck yeah yeah okay but", "13:47", "but then I was like man do I really what", "13:50", "it doesn't really make sense for me to", "13:52", "spend time designing and building a", "13:54", "house and I'd be real you know get a", "13:58", "like OCD on the little details and the", "14:00", "design and or should I be allocating", "14:04", "that time to getting us to Mars I should", "14:05", "probably do the latter so you know like", "14:09", "what's more important Mars or a house I", "14:11", "like Mars okay is that really how you", "14:14", "think like that I'd be better off", "14:17", "planning on a trip to Mars or getting", "14:20", "people to Mars yeah definitely I mean", "14:23", "you can only do so many things right", "14:25", "right so how you I don't know how you do", "14:27", "what you do anyway I don't understand", "14:29", "how you can run bolt with a boring", "14:31", "company Tesla SpaceX all these different", "14:35", "things you're doing constantly I just", "14:37", "don't understand", "14:38", "I mean you explained last time you were", "14:39", "here how you sort of allocate your time", "14:41", "and and how hectic it is insane", "14:44", "I still don't that the productivity is", "14:47", "baffling just doesn't make sense how you", "14:50", "can get so much done well I think I do", "14:53", "have high productivity but even with", "14:54", "that there's still some opportunity cost", "14:56", "of time and allocating time to building", "15:00", "a house even if it was a really great", "15:02", "house it still is not a good use of time", "15:06", "relative to developing the rockets", "15:09", "necessary to get us to Mars and helping", "15:11", "soil sustainable energy SpaceX and Tesla", "15:15", "are by far you know by the the most", "15:19", "amount of like brain cycles you know", "15:23", "boring company does not take you know", "15:25", "it's like molest 1% of rate cycles and", "15:28", "and then this neural link which is", "15:32", "I don't maybe it's like 5% and then 5%", "15:37", "that's a good chunk it's good job yeah", "15:39", "yeah we were talking about that last", "15:40", "time and you were trying to figure out", "15:42", "when it was actually going to go live", "15:45", "when it's actually going to be available", "15:47", "by testing on people right now no we're", "15:50", "not testing people yet but I I think it", "15:52", "won't be too long I think we may be able", "15:55", "to implant in your link in less than a", "16:01", "year in a person I think and when you do", "16:07", "this is there any test that you have to", "16:09", "do before you do something like this to", "16:11", "to see what percentage of people's", "16:13", "bodies are going to reject these things", "16:15", "is it but is it there is there a", "16:17", "potential for rejection it's a very low", "16:21", "potential for rejection I mean you can", "16:23", "think of it like people put in you know", "16:27", "heart monitors and you know things for", "16:31", "epileptic seizures and deep brain", "16:33", "stimulation obviously like you know", "16:36", "artificial hips and right knees and that", "16:39", "kind of thing so the probability of I", "16:42", "mean like it so it's well known like", "16:43", "what will cost rejection what what will", "16:44", "not it's definitely harder when you've", "16:48", "got something that is rate of reading", "16:55", "and writing neurons it that's that's", "16:57", "generating a current pulse on reading", "16:59", "counter pulses that's just a little", "17:00", "hotter then then it then it's a passive", "17:07", "device but it's still you know very", "17:09", "doable and yeah that there that there", "17:12", "are people who have primitive devices in", "17:14", "their brains right now what kind of", "17:16", "devices I would like deep brain", "17:18", "stimulation is providing for Parkinson's", "17:20", "is has really changed people's lives in", "17:25", "a big way which is kind of remarkable", "17:28", "because we're it kind of like zaps your", "17:31", "brain it's like kicking the TV type of", "17:33", "thing yeah and you think like man", "17:36", "kicking the TV shouldn't work it does", "17:38", "sometimes yeah yeah the old old TVs they", "17:41", "did my grandpa used to slap the top for", "17:43", "sure yeah it would work sometimes", "17:45", "yeah so this deep right simulation I", "17:47", "implanted devices in the brain that have", "17:50", "changed people's lives for the better", "17:51", "like fundamentally well let's talk about", "17:53", "what you can talk about to what neural", "17:56", "link is because the last time you were", "17:57", "here", "17:57", "I really couldn't discuss it and then", "17:59", "there was a I guess a press release", "18:01", "something that sort of ironed yeah that", "18:04", "happened quite a bit after the last time", "18:06", "you were here so what exactly is it how", "18:09", "do you do what what happens if someone", "18:12", "ultimately does get a neural link", "18:15", "installed what will take place well for", "18:18", "version one of the device it would be it", "18:22", "basically", "18:23", "implanted in your skull so but it would", "18:28", "be such a flush with your skull so you", "18:30", "basically take out a chunk of skull", "18:34", "replace put the new relic device in", "18:37", "there you put the the electrode you", "18:41", "didn't sort the electrode threads very", "18:43", "carefully into the brain and and then", "18:47", "you you know stitch it up and and you", "18:52", "wouldn't even know that somebody has and", "18:54", "then and and so then it it can interface", "18:57", "basically anywhere anywhere your brain", "18:59", "so it could be something that you know", "19:02", "helps cure say eyesight like give you", "19:05", "roberto's your eyesight even if you've", "19:07", "like lost your object of type of thing", "19:08", "like really yeah yeah absolutely", "19:11", "hearing absolutely um maybe pretty much", "19:15", "anything that were that it could in", "19:18", "principle fix almost anything that is", "19:20", "wrong with the brain and it could", "19:23", "restore limb functionality so if you've", "19:27", "got an interface into the motor cortex", "19:30", "and then an implant that's say that's", "19:34", "like a microcontroller near muscle", "19:37", "groups you could then create a sort of a", "19:41", "neural shunt that restores somebody who", "19:44", "is a quadriplegic to full functionality", "19:47", "like they can walk around be normal whoa", "19:51", "yeah so maybe slightly better slightly", "19:54", "better over time yes", "19:56", "you mean with future iterations like but", "19:58", "you know", "20:00", "although I states that would be a six", "20:04", "billion dollar so the the hole would be", "20:08", "small how big with the Hobie that you", "20:09", "have to drill and then replace with this", "20:12", "piece there's only one hole well yeah", "20:17", "the device working on right now is about", "20:20", "it's about an inch in diameter and your", "20:24", "skull is pretty thick by the way so", "20:25", "skulls are for sure it might actually", "20:27", "literally I mean pure big if you're a", "20:31", "big guy your skull is actually fairly", "20:33", "thick skulls like it's like seven to", "20:36", "fourteen millimeters so I love a couple", "20:39", "of inches a half-inch no happier six ago", "20:42", "yes so yeah so that that's a fair bit of", "20:46", "like our our we got quite a coconut", "20:49", "going on it's not it's not like some", "20:51", "eggshell oh yeah I believe you", "20:52", "so the yeah basically implant device and", "20:58", "so you would be like a one inch square", "21:01", "one inch in diameter yeah like a so an", "21:03", "inch circle like a circular yeah I think", "21:06", "like a like a SmartWatch or a dearth", "21:08", "okay yeah okay so you take this one inch", "21:12", "a minute", "21:13", "like ice fishing right you ever go ice", "21:15", "fishing no but I'd like to it's great", "21:18", "yeah it's really fun", "21:19", "so you basically take an auger and you", "21:22", "drill it take through the surface of the", "21:25", "ice yeah and you create a small hole I", "21:27", "can dunk your line in there so this is", "21:29", "like that you're ice fishing on the top", "21:31", "of your skull and then you cork it yeah", "21:33", "and you replaced that say one-inch", "21:36", "diameter piece of skull with this arrow", "21:40", "like device and that has a battery and a", "21:43", "Bluetooth and a inductive charger and", "21:47", "then you and", "21:49", "not and then you get in so with the", "21:50", "electrodes so that lectroids very", "21:53", "carefully inserted with our with a robot", "21:57", "that we developed that's look it's you", "21:59", "know very carefully putting in the", "22:00", "electrodes and avoiding you know and any", "22:02", "veins or arteries so it's it doesn't", "22:05", "create trauma so through this one inch", "22:08", "diameter yeah device electrodes be", "22:11", "inserted and they will find", "22:13", "way like tiny wires face tiny wires", "22:15", "anywheres and they'll find their way to", "22:16", "specific areas of the brain to stimulate", "22:18", "no you literally put them where it where", "22:21", "they're supposed to go oh okay yeah you", "22:24", "soon so how long will these wires be I", "22:27", "mean they usually go in like you know", "22:29", "depending on where it is like you know", "22:33", "two or three millimeters so they just", "22:36", "find the spots yeah Wow", "22:39", "and then again they you put the device", "22:44", "in and that that gets that better", "22:46", "replaces the little piece of skull I was", "22:49", "taken out and then you you stitch up the", "22:53", "hole and and you just have a look like a", "22:56", "little scar and that's it well this", "22:58", "would be replaceable or reversible yes", "23:00", "like if someone can't take it I'm too", "23:02", "smart I can't take it", "23:04", "yeah totally and what is the besides", "23:07", "restoring limb function and eyesight and", "23:10", "hearing which are all amazing is there", "23:11", "there any cognitive benefits that you", "23:13", "anticipate from something like those", "23:15", "yeah I mean you could for sure", "23:19", "I mean basically it's a generalized sort", "23:28", "of thing for for fixing any kind of", "23:33", "brain injury in principle like you've", "23:34", "you or if you've got like like severe", "23:36", "epilepsy or something like that it could", "23:37", "it could just gets just sort of stop the", "23:39", "episode epilepsy from occurring like you", "23:41", "could detect it in real time and then", "23:43", "fire a counter pulse and stop the", "23:45", "epilepsy if I mean there's a whole range", "23:51", "of brain injuries I could people someone", "23:53", "gets a stroke they could lose the", "23:54", "ability to speak into that battle", "23:58", "spectacle so we've fixed so she could", "24:00", "get like stroke damage or if you lose", "24:02", "say you know muscle control over part of", "24:05", "your face or something like that I think", "24:06", "and then when you get old you tend to if", "24:10", "you get like you know Alzheimer's or", "24:13", "something like that then you lose memory", "24:15", "and that this could help you with you", "24:17", "know restoring your memory like I think", "24:19", "we're storing memory and what what is", "24:21", "happening that's allowing it to do that", "24:23", "like the wires these small wires yeah", "24:26", "stimulating these areas of the brain and", "24:28", "then is it that the areas of the brain", "24:29", "are there they're losing some sort of", "24:32", "electrical force like what it what is", "24:33", "happening yeah yeah it's like to think", "24:37", "of us like a bunch of circuits and", "24:38", "there's some like circuits that are", "24:41", "broken and we can like fix those", "24:45", "circuits it substitute for those", "24:47", "circuits circuits and so a specific", "24:49", "frequency will go through this yeah just", "24:52", "a specific in that we is the process", "24:56", "figuring out how much or how little has", "24:58", "to be how much these areas of the brain", "25:01", "have to be juiced up yeah I mean there's", "25:04", "still a lot of work to do so when I say", "25:07", "you know we've got a shot at probably", "25:09", "putting in a person in you know a it was", "25:13", "in a year I think that's well that's", "25:15", "exactly what I mean I think we have a", "25:16", "chance of putting input into one and", "25:18", "having them having them be healthy and", "25:21", "and restoring some functionality that", "25:24", "they've lost", "25:25", "the fear is that eventually they're", "25:27", "gonna have to cut the whole top", "25:29", "someone's head off and put a new top", "25:31", "with a whole bunch of wires if you want", "25:34", "to get you know the real turbocharged", "25:37", "version the P 100 D of brain stimulation", "25:43", "I mean ultimately if you if you want to", "25:47", "go with full AI symbiosis you'll", "25:50", "probably want to do something like that", "25:53", "symbiosis is a scary word when it comes", "25:55", "to AI it's optional I would hope so", "26:02", "yeah it's just I mean once you enjoy the", "26:06", "dr. Manhattan lifestyle once once you", "26:08", "become a God seems very very unlikely", "26:12", "you're gonna want to go back to being", "26:14", "stupid again I mean you literally could", "26:16", "fundamentally change the way human", "26:18", "beings interface with each other yes yes", "26:21", "you wouldn't need to talk", "26:23", "[Laughter]", "26:26", "I'm so scared of that but so excited", "26:29", "about at the same time is that weird", "26:31", "yeah I mean the I think this is one of", "26:35", "the paths to you know I think like what", "26:41", "a like a is getting better and better so", "26:45", "now let's assume it's sort of like a", "26:47", "benign ni scenario even in a benign", "26:50", "scenario we're kind of left behind you", "26:52", "know we're not we're not along for the", "26:54", "ride we're just too dumb right so so how", "26:59", "do you go along for the ride and so you", "27:02", "can't beat them join them", "27:03", "so and we're already we're already a", "27:08", "sidewalk to some degree right cuz you've", "27:10", "got your phone you got your laptop", "27:11", "closes yeah yeah Ghidorah your", "27:14", "electronic devices yeah and I mean we're", "27:19", "today if your phone if you if you don't", "27:21", "bring your phone along it's like you", "27:22", "have missing limb syndrome it's like you", "27:25", "know feels like something's but really", "27:26", "really missing so we're already partly", "27:32", "partly a partly a cyborg or a iesson", "27:36", "buyout essentially it's just that the", "27:40", "data rate to the electronics is slow so", "27:44", "it's very specially output like you're", "27:46", "just going with your thumbs and I mean", "27:49", "like what's your data rate", "27:51", "maybe optimistically a hundred bits per", "27:54", "second that's being generous and now the", "27:58", "computer can can't communicate at it", "28:00", "like you know 100 100 terabytes so so it", "28:06", "certainly you know get gigabits or a", "28:08", "trivial at this point so this is like", "28:12", "you know basically you can your computer", "28:14", "could do not do things a million times", "28:17", "faster or at a certain point it's like", "28:22", "talking there's like talking to a tree", "28:24", "okay just boring you talk to a tree it's", "28:29", "not very entertaining so so if you if", "28:35", "you can solve the data rate issue and", "28:38", "you're especially I put", "28:40", "input - then you can improve the", "28:44", "symbiosis that is already occurring", "28:46", "between man and machine so you can", "28:50", "improve it in what when you said you", "28:52", "won't have to talk to each other anymore", "28:54", "we should joke around about that I've", "28:57", "joked around about that a million times", "28:58", "in this podcast that one day in the", "29:00", "future there's gonna come a time where", "29:01", "you can read each other's minds and well", "29:03", "you'll be able to interface with each", "29:05", "other in some sort of a nonverbal not", "29:07", "non-physical way where you will transfer", "29:10", "data back and forth to each other", "29:11", "without having to actually use your", "29:13", "mouth yeah exactly so when you like what", "29:19", "happens when you like let's say you've", "29:21", "got some complex idea that you're trying", "29:22", "to convey to somebody else and how do", "29:24", "you do that well your brain spends a lot", "29:27", "of effort compressing a complex concept", "29:31", "into words and there's a there's a lot", "29:35", "of a lot of loss an information loss", "29:37", "that occurs when compressing a complex", "29:40", "concept into words and then you say", "29:42", "those words those words are then", "29:43", "interpreted then they're decompressed by", "29:45", "the person who is listening and they", "29:47", "they will it best get a very incomplete", "29:50", "understanding of what you're trying to", "29:52", "convey it's very difficult to convey a", "29:54", "complex concept with precision because", "29:57", "you've got compression decompression you", "30:01", "may not even have heard all the woods", "30:03", "correctly and so communication is", "30:07", "difficult what we have here is a failure", "30:09", "to communicate Luke yes there's an", "30:15", "interpretation factor to like you can", "30:17", "choose to interpret certain series of", "30:22", "words in in different ways and they're", "30:25", "dependent upon tone dependent upon", "30:27", "social cues even facial expressions", "30:30", "sarcasm there's a lot of variables", "30:33", "sarcasm is difficult yes yeah and so", "30:36", "when I'm one of the things that I've", "30:39", "said it's like that there could be", "30:40", "potentially a universal language that's", "30:43", "created through computers that", "30:45", "particularly young kids would pick up", "30:47", "very quickly like my kids do tick-tock", "30:50", "and all this jazz and I don't know what", "30:52", "they're doing they just know how to do", "30:53", "it and", "30:53", "know how to do it really quickly like", "30:55", "they learn really quickly they show me", "30:56", "how to edit things and yeah it's if you", "30:58", "taught a child from first grade on how", "31:01", "to use some new universal language I", "31:04", "mean essentially like a rosetta stone", "31:06", "and something that's done with that", "31:09", "interprets your thoughts and you can", "31:12", "convey your thoughts with no room for", "31:15", "interpretation with clear very clear", "31:18", "where you know what a person saying and", "31:21", "you can tell them what you're saying and", "31:24", "there's no need for noises no need for", "31:26", "mouth noises no need for yes these sort", "31:29", "of accepted ways that we've sort of", "31:32", "evolved to make sounds that we all agree", "31:36", "we through our cultural district Marian", "31:39", "Wright we agree or certain we could", "31:41", "bypass all that yeah you can still do it", "31:43", "for four fundamental reasons right like", "31:46", "campfires yeah exactly", "31:49", "I don't need campfires I don't need to", "31:51", "roast marshmallows was fun so yeah yeah", "31:56", "I think you would in principle you would", "31:58", "be able to communicate very quickly and", "32:04", "with far more precision ideas and and", "32:10", "language would I'm not sure what would", "32:14", "happen to language but you could", "32:15", "probably get within a situation like", "32:17", "this that you would be able to just", "32:18", "kinda like the matrix you want to speak", "32:20", "it of language no problem", "32:21", "right that's why it was to download the", "32:23", "program right so at least for the first", "32:28", "iterations first few iterations we'll", "32:31", "just be able to use like I know that", "32:32", "Google has their some of their pixel", "32:36", "buds have the ability to interpret", "32:39", "languages in real time sure yeah you can", "32:42", "hear it and it'll play things back to", "32:44", "you and whatever language you choose so", "32:46", "to be something along those lines", "32:48", "yeah for the first few iterations well", "32:52", "the first few iterations are about what", "32:54", "I'm talking about it's like in the limit", "32:56", "over time you know with a lot of", "32:58", "development the first few iterations", "33:00", "really in the first few versions all", "33:03", "we're gonna be trying to do is it's all", "33:04", "pair brain injuries um", "33:06", "so it's like don't don't worry that", "33:08", "there's not gonna sneak up on you", "33:10", "because this this will take a while how", "33:12", "many years before you don't have to talk", "33:18", "if the if the development continues to", "33:24", "accelerate then maybe like five years", "33:29", "five to ten years that's quick that's", "33:33", "really quick that's the best-case", "33:34", "scenario no talking anymore", "33:36", "in five years best-case scenario ma'am", "33:39", "tens more like it", "33:40", "I've always speculated that aliens could", "33:43", "potentially be us in the future because", "33:46", "if you look at like the size their heads", "33:48", "and the fact that they have very little", "33:50", "muscle and then they don't use their", "33:51", "mouth anymore they was tiny well I mean", "33:53", "the archetypal ain't alien that you see", "33:55", "in like Close Encounters of the Third", "33:57", "Kind they they're like if you went from", "33:59", "like Australia Pittacus or ancient", "34:04", "hominid to us what's the difference less", "34:06", "hair less muscle bigger head and then", "34:10", "just keep going thousand a million", "34:12", "whatever your or five years whatever it", "34:15", "whatever happens when neural link goes", "34:17", "on online and then we slowly start to", "34:21", "adapt to this new way of being where we", "34:25", "don't use our muscles anymore we have", "34:27", "this gigantic head we can talk without", "34:29", "words you could also save state and save", "34:36", "state save state like save your brain", "34:39", "state like like a save game in a video", "34:41", "game whoa like like if you want to swap", "34:44", "from Windows 95", "34:45", "well yeah I think we are Windows 95", "34:51", "right now future perspective probably", "34:55", "but yeah I mean you you could save state", "34:59", "and restore that state into a biological", "35:03", "being if you if you wanted to in the", "35:05", "future I'm principal is like knowing", "35:06", "like for physics standpoint that", "35:07", "prevents us now you'd be a little", "35:09", "different but then you're also a little", "35:10", "different when you wake up in the", "35:11", "morning from yesterday and you're a", "35:12", "little different in fact if you say like", "35:14", "you five years ago versus you today is", "35:17", "quite a big difference yes so", "35:19", "you'd be substantially you I mean you'd", "35:22", "be you'd certainly think you're you but", "35:23", "the idea of saving yourself and then", "35:27", "transforming that into some sort of a", "35:29", "biological state like you could hang out", "35:32", "with 30 year old you I mean the", "35:35", "possibilities are endless", "35:37", "[Laughter]", "35:40", "I mean these things think like how your", "35:42", "phone can you can record videos on your", "35:44", "phone like there's no way you could", "35:46", "remember a video right as accurately as", "35:48", "your phone or a camera you know could so", "35:52", "if you've got like it you know some some", "35:55", "yep", "35:56", "version 10 your link whatever in far in", "35:59", "the future you could you could remote", "36:02", "you could recall everything but just", "36:04", "like it's a movie critic including all", "36:07", "the entire sensory experience emotions", "36:09", "everything everything everything and", "36:12", "play it back thank you she added it yeah", "36:17", "so you can change your past you could", "36:19", "change what do you think was your fast", "36:21", "yeah well so if you had like a stressful", "36:23", "thing right now could be a replayed", "36:26", "memory it could be yeah it may be what's", "36:30", "the odds of this being a replayed memory", "36:32", "you had a guess it's more than 50%", "36:36", "there's no way to assign a probability", "36:38", "with accuracy here right but roughly if", "36:44", "you just had a just gut instinct well I", "36:49", "don't happen you were linked in my brain", "36:51", "so I say right now is your a percent but", "36:55", "at the point of what you do have in your", "36:57", "link then it rises above 0% the idea", "37:03", "that we're experiencing some sort of a", "37:05", "preserved memory is even though it's", "37:09", "still the same it's not comforting right", "37:12", "for some reason when people talk about", "37:15", "simulation theory they talk about the", "37:17", "potential for this currently being a", "37:19", "simulation it's even though your life", "37:21", "might be wonderful you might be in love", "37:24", "you might love your career you might", "37:26", "have great friends but it's not", "37:29", "comforting to know that this experience", "37:31", "somehow or another doesn't exist in a", "37:33", "material", "37:33", "you can knock on feels real to feels", "37:37", "real but but if it's not but the idea", "37:39", "that it's not is for some strange reason", "37:43", "disconcerting what yeah I'm sure", "37:45", "should be disconcerting because then if", "37:48", "this is not real what is well but but", "37:51", "the you know there's that old sort of", "37:54", "thought experiment of like how do you", "37:57", "know you're not a brain-in-a-vat you", "38:00", "know right now here's the thing you are", "38:02", "a brain an event then that faddish your", "38:04", "skull yes and everything you see feel", "38:07", "hear and what everything all your senses", "38:09", "our electrical signals everything", "38:12", "everything is an electrical signal to to", "38:18", "arraign an event where the batteries", "38:19", "rose gold and all your hormones all you", "38:22", "neurotransmitters all these things are", "38:24", "drugs adrenaline is a drug", "38:26", "dopamine's a drug you're a drug factory", "38:29", "they're constantly changing your state", "38:31", "with love and oxytocin and and beauty", "38:35", "sure changes your state great music", "38:37", "changes your state absolutely and yet", "38:42", "here's another sort of interesting idea", "38:44", "which is because you say like where did", "38:47", "consciousness arise well assuming you", "38:50", "believe the belief in physics which", "38:53", "appears to be true then you know we the", "38:57", "universe started off as basically quarks", "39:00", "and leptons and quickly became hydrogen", "39:02", "and helium lithium like basically", "39:05", "elements the periodic table like mostly", "39:08", "hydrogen basically and then and then", "39:13", "over a long period of time you know 13.8", "39:18", "billion years later that hydrogen became", "39:20", "sentient but so where along the way that", "39:27", "concha where isn't that consciousness", "39:29", "what's the line of consciousness and not", "39:30", "consciousness between hydrogen and here", "39:33", "right when do we call it when do we call", "39:36", "it consciousness I was watching a video", "39:38", "today that we played on a podcast", "39:39", "earlier of a monkey riding a motorcycle", "39:42", "down the street jumps off the motorcycle", "39:43", "and tries to steal a baby yeah so that", "39:45", "one it", "39:46", "what is that monkey conscious it seems", "39:50", "like it is seems like it had a plan it", "39:52", "was riding a fucking motorcycle and then", "39:54", "jumped off the motorcycle tries to steal", "39:55", "a baby seemed pretty the one that just", "39:58", "subtract baby down the street pretty far", "40:00", "yeah yeah", "40:01", "seems pretty conscious right that's", "40:06", "definitely some degree of consciousness", "40:07", "there yeah it's not like it's not a worm", "40:10", "it seems to be on another level yeah and", "40:13", "it's gonna keep going and that that's", "40:16", "the real concern when when people think", "40:20", "about the potential future versions of", "40:23", "human beings especially when you", "40:24", "consider symbiotic relationship to", "40:27", "artificial intelligence it will be", "40:28", "unrecognizable that one day will be so", "40:30", "far removed from what this is we'll look", "40:33", "back on this the way we look back now on", "40:36", "you know simple simple organisms that we", "40:39", "evolved from and then it won't be that", "40:42", "far in the future that we do have this", "40:45", "this view back well I hope consciousness", "40:48", "propagates into the future and gets more", "40:50", "more sophisticated and complex and and", "40:52", "that understands the questions to ask", "40:56", "about the universe do you think that's", "40:58", "the case as a human being as yourself", "41:01", "you're clearly trying to make conscious", "41:04", "decisions to be a better version of you", "41:07", "right this is

a better version of the way I", "41:17", "interface with reality that this is", "41:20", "always the way things are if you're if", "41:22", "you're moving in a some sort of a", "41:25", "direction where you're trying to improve", "41:26", "things you're always gonna move into", "41:28", "this new place we look back in the old", "41:31", "place and go I was doing it wrong back", "41:32", "then so this is an accelerated version", "41:36", "of that yes super accelerated version of", "41:39", "that I mean you don't always improve but", "41:43", "you can aspire to improve you can aspire", "41:45", "to be less wrong yeah it was like I", "41:48", "think it good the tools of physics are", "41:50", "very powerful like just to see me wrong", "41:52", "and your astral goal is to be less wrong", "41:54", "I don't think you're gonna if you", "41:57", "succeed every day and being less wrong", "41:58", "but you know", "41:59", "if you can't succeed in being less wrong", "42:01", "most the time you're doing great", "42:04", "that's a great way of putting it aspire", "42:05", "to be less wrong but then when you know", "42:09", "people look back in nostalgia about", "42:10", "simpler times there's that too it's very", "42:12", "romantic and exciting to look back on", "42:16", "campfires because they'll have a", "42:18", "campfire yes yeah but we appreciate it", "42:21", "when you're a super nerd when you're", "42:22", "connected to the grid and you have some", "42:24", "skullcap and it's in place of the top of", "42:27", "your head and it's interfacing with the", "42:30",

yes", "42:53", "but that's there's something about", "42:56", "there's something about the beauty of", "42:58", "the crudeness of language where when", "43:01", "it's done eloquently it's it's it's",

feeling but the fact that a human did", "43:37", "it - yeah do you think that it'll be", "43:40", "like electronic music like people won't", "43:42", "appreciate it like they appreciate a", "43:43",

interesting and", "43:58", "we should try to make that way I hope", "44:01", "it's more fun and interesting - yeah I", "44:03", "just you know I just hope you don't lose", "44:05", "anything along the way when I lose", "44:08", "little obviously we gain more than lose", "44:10", "yeah that's the thing right gave me more", "44:12", "than we lose like", "44:13", "something that makes us interesting is", "44:14", "that we're so flawed I stopped for sure", "44:16", "alright yeah I mean you look at", "44:20", "civilization through the ages most of", "44:23", "them you know they rose and fell yeah", "44:25", "and I do think like the globalization", "44:31", "that that we have at these sort of like", "44:36", "the the mean sphere is there's there's", "44:39", "not enough isolation between countries", "44:42", "or regions it's like if you get up if", "44:47", "there's a mind virus that that mind", "44:50", "virus cannot infect too much of the", "44:51", "world you know like I actually sort of", "44:55", "some ties with the anti-globalization", "44:57", "people because it's like man we don't", "45:00", "ever want to everywhere it'll be the", "45:01", "same for sure and and then we we need", "45:04", "some kind of like mind viral immunity so", "45:08", "that's it's a bit concerning mind viral", "45:12", "immunity meaning that once something", "45:14", "like neural link gets established the", "45:17", "real concern is something that mean you", "45:19", "said it's Bluetooth right or some future", "45:22", "version of that that the idea is that", "45:24", "something could possibly get into it", "45:26", "fuck it up no I'm talking about like", "45:28", "somebody there's some cockeyed concept", "45:31", "that that's happened that happens right", "45:36", "right now mm-hmm", "45:38", "y know this viruses and embedded chips", "45:41", "right like people have they've embedded", "45:43", "chips and then acquired viruses that", "45:46", "what I'm talk about in mind voice I'm", "45:47", "talking about like a cake concept of", "45:50", "that it affects people's minds oh okay", "45:52", "okay", "45:53", "like cult thinking or yeah I'm sort of", "45:57", "fundamentalism yeah wrong had an idea", "46:00", "that yes goes viral in a an idea sense", "46:06", "mm-hmm well that is that that is a", "46:09", "problem too right if someone can", "46:10", "manipulate that technology to make", "46:12", "something appear logical or rational", "46:15", "yeah yeah that would it would that be an", "46:18", "issue to with this is a very have versus", "46:22", "have-nots issue right once this thing if", "46:24", "this really does I'm", "46:26", "initially it's going to help people with", "46:28", "with injuries and but you said", "46:30", "ultimately it could lead to this", "46:33", "spectacular cognitive change yes but the", "46:36", "people that first get it should have us", "46:38", "a massive advantage over people that", "46:41", "don't have it yet well I mean it's the", "46:44", "kind of thing where your productivity", "46:46", "would improve", "46:47", "I don't know dramatically maybe by a", "46:49", "factor of 10 with it", "46:50", "so you could definitely just you know I", "46:55", "don't know take out a loan and do it and", "46:57", "earn earn the money back real fast yeah", "47:00", "super smart but in a capitalist society", "47:04", "you know you could it seems like you", "47:07", "could really get so far ahead that", "47:08", "before everybody else could afford this", "47:11", "thing and link up and get connected as", "47:13", "well you'd be so far how they could", "47:15", "never catch you is that a concern uh", "47:18", "well I think the I'm just not a super", "47:24", "huge concern I mean there are huge", "47:25", "differences in cognitive ability and and", "47:27", "resources already yeah I mean you can", "47:30", "think of a corporation as like a", "47:32", "cybernetic collective that's far smarter", "47:36", "than an individual like III couldn't", "47:38", "personally build like a whole rocket and", "47:40", "and the engines and launch it and", "47:42", "everything that's impossible", "47:44", "but you know we have 8,000 people with", "47:46", "SpaceX and you like piecing it out to", "47:53", "different people and using like", "47:55", "computers and machines and stuff we can", "47:59", "make lots of rockets launched at all but", "48:01", "duck with the space station and that", "48:03", "kind of thing you know so that already", "48:07", "exists where this you know where those", "48:11", "corporations are vastly more capable", "48:13", "than an individual but the the yeah like", "48:20", "we should be I think less concerned", "48:22", "about like relative capabilities between", "48:26", "people and more like they're having AI", "48:31", "be vastly you know beyond us and", "48:35", "decoupled from human will decoupled from", "48:39", "humans", "48:40", "so this is the if you can't beat them", "48:41", "join them yeah I mean so you feel like", "48:45", "it's inevitable like a sentient AI is", "48:48", "essentially inevitable super sentient AI", "48:50", "yeah look beyond a level that's", "48:53", "difficult to understand and impossible", "48:56", "Tarzan probably and somehow or another", "48:59", "us so it's almost like it's a", "49:05", "requirement for survival to achieve some", "49:09", "sort of symbiotic existence with AI it's", "49:13", "not a requirement it's just if you if", "49:18", "you want to be along for the ride then", "49:23", "you need to do some kind of symbiosis so", "49:25", "the way your brain works right now", "49:27", "you've got kind of like the animal brain", "49:30", "reptile brain kind of lets frogs they", "49:34", "like the limbic system basically and", "49:36", "you've got the cortex now that the brain", "49:40", "purists will argue with this definition", "49:41", "but essentially you've got the primitive", "49:44", "brain and you've got the the sort of", "49:47", "smart brain or the brain that's capable", "49:50", "of planning and understanding concepts", "49:52", "and different difficult you know things", "49:54", "that a monkey can't understand now the", "49:58", "your cortex is much much smarter than", "50:01", "your limbic system nonetheless they work", "50:05", "together well so I haven't met anyone", "50:08", "who wants to delete their limbic system", "50:09", "or the cortex they're people quite happy", "50:12", "having both so we can think about this", "50:16", "as being like that the computer the AI", "50:19", "is it's like a third layer of tertiary", "50:21", "layer so that is like that could be", "50:25", "symbiotic with the cortex if we much", "50:27", "smarter than the cortex but you", "50:29", "essentially have three layers and you", "50:31", "actually have that right now your phone", "50:33", "is capable of things and your computer", "50:35", "is capable things that your brain is", "50:36", "definitely not you know storing the", "50:40", "terabytes of information perfectly", "50:44", "doing incredible calculations that you", "50:48", "know we couldn't even come close to", "50:49", "doing you have that with your computer", "50:52", "it's just like I said the data rate is", "50:54", "slow your the connection is weak why is", "50:58", "it so disconcerting or why is it why", "51:01", "does it not give me comfort to think", "51:04", "about like when I think about a", "51:06", "symbiotic connection to AI I always", "51:08", "think of this cold emotionless sort of", "51:13", "thing that we will become is that a bad", "51:17", "way to look at it I don't think that's", "51:18", "that's not quick that's not how it would", "51:20", "be it likes it you you already are yeah", "51:23", "sabbatic with AI or computers phones", "51:26", "computers laptops yeah and this this", "51:29", "quite a bit of AI going on you know so", "51:31", "artificial neural Nets increasingly", "51:35", "neural nets are sort of taking over from", "51:39", "regular programming more and more so you", "51:44", "are connected you know if you use Google", "51:50", "Voice or Alexa or one of those things", "51:51", "it's using a neural net to decode your", "51:53", "speech and try understand what you're", "51:54", "saying you know if you're trying to", "51:58", "image recognition or improve the quality", "52:00", "of photograph it's it's using the neuron", "52:03", "that's the best way to do that so you", "52:07", "are already sort of it's sort of a", "52:12", "cybernetics my oat it like said you know", "52:16", "it's just a question of your data rate", "52:19", "the the communication speed between your", "52:23", "phone and your brain is slow when do you", "52:27", "think you're gonna do it how long will", "52:29", "you wait like once it starts becoming", "52:34", "available yeah if it works I'll do it", "52:36", "sure right away I mean let's make sure", "52:40", "it works how do we make sure it works we", "52:43", "try it on prisoners like what do you do", "52:45", "no no rapists no cut holes in their head", "52:48", "I like said if somebody's got a serious", "52:50", "brain injury right and there you know", "52:53", "people have like very severe brain", "52:54", "injuries then and then you can fix those", "52:58", "those brain injuries and you know then", "53:02", "you prove out that it works and you all", "53:05", "Bluff expand and", "53:06", "make me more and more brain injuries it", "53:10", "sold more and more and then you know", "53:12", "certainly at certain age we will are", "53:14", "gonna get Alzheimer's we're all gonna", "53:15", "get senile and then you know mom's", "53:18", "forget the names their kids and that", "53:20", "kind of thing and so you know dude it's", "53:22", "like you said okay well you know this", "53:24", "would allow you to remember your names", "53:27", "of your kids and and have a normal", "53:30", "they're a much more normal life where", "53:32", "you you you were able to function much", "53:34", "later in life so I think that so", "53:37", "essentially that there would almost", "53:39", "everyone would find a need at some point", "53:41", "if if you get old enough to use in your", "53:44", "own your link and and and then it's like", "53:48", "okay so we can improve the functionality", "53:51", "and improve the communications to", "53:53", "communication speed so then you will not", "53:57", "have to use your thumbs to communicate", "53:59", "with the computer do you ever sit down", "54:03", "extrapolate do you ever that like sit", "54:04", "down and think about all the different", "54:07", "iterations of this and what this", "54:09", "eventually leads to yeah sure think", "54:15", "about a lot there's like said this is", "54:20", "not something it's gonna sneak up on you", "54:21", "you know there's like getting FDA", "54:23", "approval for this stuff is not like", "54:24", "overnight you know and this this I mean", "54:31", "we probably have to be on like version", "54:33", "10 or something before you know you it", "54:38", "it would realistically be you know a", "54:45", "human a ice and bio situation it see it", "54:52", "coming you know you see it coming but", "54:54", "what do you think it's gonna be like", "54:55", "when you sit when you're alone if you", "54:58", "have free time I don't know if you have", "54:59", "free time but if you just sit down and", "55:01", "think about this iteration the next", "55:04", "onward keep going and you drag it out", "55:08", "with improvements along the way and", "55:10", "leaps and bounds and technological", "55:12", "innovations and where do you see it what", "55:19", "are we gonna be a", "55:20", "and 2025 years from now what are we", "55:22", "gonna be", "55:30", "well assuming civilization is still", "55:32", "around it's looking fragile right now I", "55:37", "think we I think we could have a 25", "55:44", "years probably something I would think", "55:45", "there could be a whole brain interface a", "55:48", "whole brain interface so I'm pretty", "55:52", "close to that yeah how does how do you", "55:53", "define what do you mean by whole brain", "55:55", "interface like almost all the neurons", "56:01", "are connected to your these sort of AI", "56:10", "extension of yourself if you want AI", "56:16", "extension of yourself yeah what does", "56:20", "that mean to you like when you say AI", "56:21", "extension of yourself well you like said", "56:26", "you already have a computer extension of", "56:29", "yourself in your phone you know and", "56:31", "computers and stuff so and now online", "56:34", "it's like somebody dies there's like an", "56:35", "online ghost that there get their stole", "56:38", "their online stuff is yeah", "56:40", "it's alive that's a good way to put it", "56:42", "is weird when you read someone's tweets", "56:44", "have their dad yeah yeah Instagram and", "56:47", "their stories and yeah whatever Facebook", "56:50", "it's not you know like you know it's", "56:52", "like an online ghost that's very", "56:55", "accurate yeah so yeah so that there's it", "57:03", "would just be that that more of you", "57:05", "would be in the cloud I guess then in", "57:08", "your body", "57:09", "or if it more of you Wow", "57:15", "now when you say civilizations fragile", "57:17", "do you mean because of this covet 19", "57:19", "shit that's going on right now what's", "57:21", "that it's this thing you know it's like", "57:23", "some people just get a copy over other", "57:26", "people it gets much worse sure yeah well", "57:34", "yeah", "57:36", "I mean this certainly has taken over the", "57:41", "mind space of the world to a degree that", "57:44", "is quite shocking yeah well I don't know", "57:47", "where that's what's crazy it's like you", "57:49", "go back to November nothing now here we", "57:52", "are December January February March", "57:54", "April May six months totally different", "57:57", "world", "57:58", "so from nothing to everything's locked", "58:00", "down there's so much conflicting", "58:03", "information and conflicting opinions", "58:05", "about how to proceed what what has", "58:08", "happened you you find things where there", "58:11", "was a meatpacking plant", "58:13", "I believe in Missouri where 300 plus", "58:17", "people or asymptomatic tested positive", "58:20", "ray symptomatic and then in other places", "58:23", "it just ravages entire communities and", "58:25", "kills people and it's it's so weird", "58:27", "it almost appears on the outlook if you", "58:30", "didn't know any better you'd be like", "58:31", "what it seems like there's a bunch of", "58:32", "different viruses doesn't seem like it's", "58:35", "the same thing or has a bunch of", "58:37", "different reactions to the biological", "58:40", "variety of people yeah I mean I I kind", "58:48", "of sold this whole thing play out in", "58:50", "China before it played out in the u.s.", "58:53", "so it's kind of like watching the same", "58:57", "movie again but in English yeah", "59:07", "I might I think the thievery that the", "59:13", "mortality rate is is much less than what", "59:16", "is then what say the World Health", "59:19", "Organization said it was it's very much", "59:21", "much less acai probably at least order", "59:23", "of magnitude less well it it seems to be", "59:26", "very deadly to very specific kinds of", "59:28", "people and people with specific problems", "59:32", "yeah I mean if you're you can look at", "59:36", "the mortality statistics you know by age", "59:38", "and whether they have come whatever it", "59:40", "come over it is like do they have like", "59:42", "basically existing conditions and by age", "59:45", "and you know if you're", "59:50", "below 60 and and have no serious health", "59:55", "issues the probability of death is", "59:56", "extremely low it's not zero but it's", "59:58", "extremely low they didn't think that", "60:02", "this was the case though when they first", "60:04", "started to lock down the country do you", "60:06", "think that it's a situation where once", "60:09", "they've proceeded in a certain way it's", "60:11", "very difficult to correct course that's", "60:18", "most like people really wanted a panic", "60:22", "quite quite crazy but in some places a", "60:26", "panic is deserved right look if you're", "60:28", "in the ICU in Manhattan and people are", "60:30", "dying left and right and everyone's on", "60:31", "into baiters and it's a when you see all", "60:37", "these people on ventilators and so many", "60:39", "of them are dying and you see these", "60:41", "nurses are dying and doctors are getting", "60:43", "sick in some places that fear is", "60:46", "justified but then in other places", "60:49", "you're you're reading these stories", "60:51", "about hospitals that are essentially", "60:54", "half-empty they're they're having to", "60:56", "furlough doctors and nurses because", "60:58", "there's no work for them most of the", "61:01", "hospitals in the United States right now", "61:02", "half-empty or in some cases they're at", "61:05", "30% capacity and is this because they've", "61:08", "decided to forgo elective procedures and", "61:11", "and and normal things that people would", "61:14", "have to go to the hospital for yes I", "61:17", "mean and we're not talking about just", "61:19", "some of these elective procedures are", "61:21", "quite important yeah it's like you have", "61:23", "a bad heart disease yeah sure and you", "61:25", "need a you know triple bypass it's like", "61:28", "sort of elective but if you don't get it", "61:31", "done in time it's you're gonna die", "61:33", "yeah it's electives weird word elective", "61:35", "it's not like hey I wanna there's no", "61:39", "like plastic surgeries like it's more", "61:43", "like like my my hip is I'm an extreme", "61:45", "pain because my my hips blown out or my", "61:47", "knee and I don't want to go to the", "61:49", "hospital I can't go to the hospital to", "61:51", "you know people in extreme pain feel", "61:53", "that need a kidney you know like people", "61:55", "have to have like quite serious issues", "61:57", "that are choosing not to go out of fear", "61:59", "so I think it's it's a problem good it's", "62:03", "C", "62:03", "like the state of public perception is", "62:05", "shifting it is like people are taking", "62:08", "some deep breaths and relaxing and", "62:10", "because of the statistics of I mean and", "62:13", "and essentially across the board it's", "62:15", "being recognized that it's not as fatal", "62:19", "as we thought it was still danger is", "62:21", "still worse than the flu but not as bad", "62:23", "as we thought or are we feared it could", "62:26", "be I'm an objectively the mortality is", "62:30", "as much lower like at least a factor of", "62:35", "10 maybe a factor of 50 lower than", "62:38", "initially thought do you think that the", "62:42", "current way we're handling this the", "62:45", "social distancing the mass the

you", "89:40", "have the president's ear or if people", "89:41", "wanted to just listen to you openly what", "89:44", "do you think is the way out of this so", "89:46", "let's just clear up the data

this is not a question", "90:38", "mark right but this is never this is", "90:41", "unprecedented right like if someone had", "90:43", "the flu but also had a heart attack they", "90:45", "would assume that that person died of a", "90:46", "heart attack yes", "90:47", "yeah so this is unprecedented is this", "90:50", "because this is such a popular I don't", "90:54", "use that word the wrong

"91:28", "well the similar spill says if you know", "91:31", "we get all this you know money if we say", "91:34", "if if they if it's a Cova death I'm like", "91:37", "ok they coughed before they died they in", "91:41", "fact they're not even diagnosis code but", "91:43", "they simply if you had weakness a cough", "91:46", "shortness of breath but frankly I'm not", "91:48", "sure how you died without those things", "91:50", "yeah you yeah but there's so many", "91:54", "different things that you could", "91:56", "attribute to Cova - there's so many", "91:58", "symptoms there's diarrhea headaches", "92:01", "dehydration yeah off yes", "92:03", "but to be clear you you you don't even", "92:05", "need to have gotten a covert a crisis", "92:08", "you simply need to have had one of yeah", "92:12", "many symptoms and then have died for", "92:14", "some reason and it's covered so so then", "92:20", "it makes the death count look very high", "92:21", "and then we're then stuck in a bind", "92:24", "because it looks like the death count", "92:25", "super high and not going down like it", "92:27", "should be and now so then we should keep", "92:31", "whatever you know keep you know the", "92:37", "shelter in place stuff there and and", "92:40", "keep people in their home", "92:41", "you know confine people the homes so we", "92:43", "need to break out of this this we're",

"92:54", "altering perceptions public perception", "92:57", "from people that are basically in a", "92:59", "panic there's a lot of essentially well", "93:01", "at least a month ago we're clearly in a", "93:05", "panic I mean right weird yet you know", "93:06", "when you look around April 5th April 6th", "93:10", "people were really freaking out but here", "93:12", "we are May and many people are relaxing", "93:15", "a little bit", "93:16", "yes they're realizing okay um I actually", "93:19", "know a couple of people that got it it", "93:21", "was just a cough and I know some people", "93:22", "that got it the word nothing happened I", "93:24", "know a lot of people who got it I know", "93:29", "zero people who died and died I mean it", "93:31", "bad no yeah a lot of people who got it", "93:33", "yeah it's it's not what we feared we", "93:37", "feared something much worse that's", "93:38", "correct", "93:39", "so the adjustments difficult to make so", "93:40", "you said first of all we need real data", "93:43", "you need it just parse out the data", "93:45", "don't don't lump it all together no and", "93:47", "then you know if you give if you get", "93:49", "people just parse out the data better", "93:52", "clearer clearer information about like", "93:58", "said was this an actual curve a", "94:00", "diagnosis or is it a did they get the", "94:02", "test and the key test came back positiv", "94:04", "or do they just have some symptoms just", "94:05", "parse that those two out and then parse", "94:09", "out just if somebody died did they die", "94:11", "did they but that they even have a Cova", "94:14", "test or did they just have one of many", "94:17", "symptoms like like like how do you die", "94:19", "without weakness I don't know it's", "94:21", "impossible basically yeah good point", "94:23", "you're gonna die you're gonna have", "94:24", "shortness of breath weakness and you", "94:27", "might kaufe little so so was it", "94:30", "quantified what was it yeah did that", "94:31", "person that do they actually have a Cova", "94:32", "test and and the tests come back", "94:34", "positive and then if they died did they", "94:37", "die where we're covered was it isn't had", "94:41", "to be the the main course but it was a", "94:42", "significant contributor to their death", "94:45", "or was it not a significant contributor", "94:47", "to the death right it's not as simple as", "94:51", "just because you had Kovac Kovac killed", "94:54", "you this is definitely not right yeah", "94:57", "yeah I mean people die all the time they", "94:59", "have like flu and yes other colds and we", "95:02", "don't say that they died if those flu", "95:03", "and other colds well that's what's so", "95:05", "weird I'm sorry it's so popular and I", "95:08", "use that word in a weird way but it's so", "95:10", "popular that we've kind of forgotten", "95:12", "people died in ammonia everyday yeah", "95:15", "people died of the flu didn't take a", "95:17",

"95:44", "man cigarettes not cigarettes will", "95:45", "really kill you that's a weird one right", "95:47", "we're terrified of this disease that", "95:50", "were projected it could potentially kill", "95:52", "one hundred if not two hundred thousand", "95:54", "Americans is here with cigarettes kill", "95:56", "five hundred thousand and you don't hear", "95:58", "a peep out of any

"96:49", "the number of attack over here I'm sure", "96:52", "the exact number but I believe it until", "96:55", "the opioid crisis I believe Tylenol was", "96:57", "the number one killer of all drugs", "96:59", "because how basically it's if you have", "97:03", "if you get drunk and take a lot of", "97:05", "Tylenol acetaminophen essentially it", "97:08", "causes liver failure so severe would", "97:12", "like get get wasted and then like have a", "97:15", "headache and then pop it's curtains Wow", "97:18", "yeah curtains yeah you know so but", "97:22", "nobody's like you know raging against", "97:25", "tylenol yeah it's weird except", "97:28", "acceptable deaths are weird and that's", "97:30", "the real the slippery slope about this", "97:32", "people shaming people for wanting to go", "97:35", "back to work you know other people are", "97:36", "gonna die well if you", "97:38", "arrive do you drive we should stop", "97:40", "driving because people die from driving", "97:42",

do nobody lives forever", "98:13", "right I mean the the the I mean I think", "98:17", "you want to look at say deaths as like", "98:19", "the but for this disease whatever they", "98:23", "would have lived X number of years yeah", "98:25", "you know so you know if somebody dies", "98:28", "when they're there they're 20 and could", "98:30", "live till 80 they lost 60 years but if", "98:33",

that that", "101:00", "information should be that should be", "101:03", "distributed in a way a non-judgmental", "101:05", "way but like look this is this is a way", "101:07", "that we can all like this is a", "101:09", "scientifically proven way that we can", "101:11", "boost our immune system and it might", "101:12", "save your life and it might save the", "101:14", "life of your loved ones
