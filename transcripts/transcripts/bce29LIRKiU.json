think will surprise people", "04:43", "when they find out both who was running", "04:45", "it who was responsible and to the degree", "04:47", "possible you know what did it cost us", "04:49", "and you know who was involved and and to", "04:52", "what degree did it lead to something", "04:53", "else that we're doing now so there's a", "04:55", "lot of lot of you know threads to pull", "04:58",

and", "05:40", "somebody comes up with some you know", "05:41", "dumbass idea the next thing you know it", "05:43", "turns into a TV show or something but", "05:44", "it's it's it's not unlike that a lot of", "05:48", "smart guys sitting around a table", "05:49", "thinking well here's the problem how do", "05:52", "we resolve it and the key is to do it", "05:54", "creatively right they come up with", "05:55", "because if you get a bunch of engineer", "05:56", "sitting around a table you hope that", "05:58", "they're not at all approaching it from", "05:59", "the same point of view right it's like", "06:01", "with an operation if you've got it", "06:02", "you got a high-value target out there", "06:04", "and you got to figure out how to get yet", "06:06", "access get to them you want ideas coming", "06:09", "in from all directions you don't want it", "06:10", "you don't want to you know squelch", "06:12", "creativity and believe it or not I mean", "06:15", "the Intel community the military", "06:17", "they've been enormously creative over", "06:19", "the years in developing new technologies", "06:21", "and developing operational ideas and", "06:24", "methodologies so it's what we're trying", "06:26", "to do is shed some light on that well I", "06:28", "would imagine there's a certain amount", "06:30", "of I don't want to use the word fun but", "06:33", "that's really the right word like some", "06:35", "of it's got to be fun to develop this", "06:36", "stuff and to implement it and go out and", "06:38", "get bad guys with it and to see your", "06:40", "pride", "06:41", "come to fruition and actually have a", "06:43", "positive effect on the world absolutely", "06:45", "I mean if you it really is its it's that", "06:48", "something because you know in operations", "06:50", "anyway you know you engage in something", "06:53", "out there in some you know you know", "06:55", "place around the world wherever it may", "06:57", "be and you know you realizes you walk in", "07:00", "a way that you know there's not a lot of", "07:02", "people doing this at this moment on the", "07:03", "planet right I mean so the operational", "07:05", "activity itself is is enormous ly", "07:07", "entertaining as long as it goes right", "07:09", "but it's also the buildup it's all that", "07:12", "homework that gets you there right it's", "07:13", "it's like that take down a bin Laden we", "07:15", "didn't just happen to get lucky and rock", "07:17", "up on its doorstep right in the body bod", "07:18", "that was eight or nine years of fucking", "07:21", "hard work right heavy lifting chasing", "07:24", "down countless bad leads and doing", "07:27", "enormous amounts of surveillance street", "07:29", "work and and tracking down assets and", "07:31", "doing a mean just it just the hard hard", "07:33", "work that eventually allowed that you", "07:36", "know all those guys from from the teams", "07:38", "to land and do their job that's what's", "07:41", "interesting to me - is that the guy", "07:43", "who's writing the book about all this", "07:45", "stuff and talking about you know the man", "07:47", "who shot bin Laden that guy is persona", "07:49", "non grata in the community like you", "07:52", "talked to the other seals they're like", "07:54", "you don't you don't do that right right", "07:56", "you don't do that you know you don't", "07:58", "write books about that you don't talk", "07:59", "about that and I'll it for a short-term", "08:02", "gain you know you make some profit off", "08:05", "of it but you lose the brothership you", "08:06", "lose a yeah exactly you you're you're", "08:08", "kind of on the outs in the club and but", "08:11", "I will say this the reason why I think", "08:13", "the horse got out of the barn on on that", "08:16", "whole issue of guys writing books are", "08:19", "getting out there and talking about", "08:20", "specific operations it's because senior", "08:24", "commanders and and senior people right", "08:26", "people that came out of the top levels", "08:28", "of government started writing their", "08:30", "memoirs you know started revisiting", "08:32", "history while they were it was their", "08:34", "watch and then and coming up with you", "08:36", "know their explanations for history and", "08:38", "I think all the guys below you know", "08:41", "junior ranks and street level operators", "08:43", "they looked at that and thought what the", "08:45", "fuck if they can do it right on me and", "08:47", "because you've got to set the tone from", "08:49", "the top and I think that's where it got", "08:50", "it got you know kind of sideways", "08:52", "plus when you have someone who", "08:54", "you know has a crazy story like marcus", "08:57", "luttrell and it becomes an amazing movie", "08:58", "it also it does help the community right", "09:02", "because it gets a bunch of people that", "09:03", "are really interested in becoming a seal", "09:05", "it gets people to appreciate the the", "09:08", "unbelievable sacrifice and hard work", "09:10", "that's involved yeah I think that's I", "09:12", "think that is there is an upside right", "09:14", "yeah there's an upside to it but I think", "09:15", "you this it's a fine balance right what", "09:17", "point do you go over that line so so", "09:19", "you're right in the sense that you know", "09:21", "we see that with who mad with the FBI or", "09:24", "DEA you know they got out there and put", "09:26", "their thumbprint on some TV shows right", "09:27", "because I think it kind of it it", "09:29", "expanded in in part awareness of what", "09:33", "they do I'm sure it helped their", "09:35", "recruitment and so the seals are no", "09:37", "different but at the same time you know", "09:41", "you sign a piece of paper at the very", "09:42", "beginning that says you're gonna keep", "09:43", "your Yap shut", "09:44", "yeah and and it's one thing to come out", "09:47", "work from whatever unit or whatever team", "09:50", "or whatever organization and say I'm", "09:52", "gonna write I don't know about my time", "09:55", "in it and it's not a look at sources and", "09:57", "methods not look at operations it's not", "09:58", "that it's more of you know this is what", "10:01", "happened you know during my time and I", "10:02", "think there's I'm not explaining it very", "10:04", "well but I think there's a way you can", "10:06", "do that without screwing the pooch but I", "10:08", "think that I think the seals got", "10:10", "overexposed and I think a lot of the", "10:13", "guys resent that", "10:15", "yeah and so but again you're right there", "10:18", "there was some upside to it", "10:19", "well there's upside to some of the", "10:21", "stories right like that definitely is", "10:23", "upside to marcus luttrell store because", "10:25", "it's just so incredible to be fresh in", "10:26", "here about it but I think that there's", "10:30", "also it's important to maintain that", "10:33", "honor it's more important to maintain", "10:35", "that that bond of silence you know that", "10:39", "you guys you know they're doing", "10:41", "something that is probably one of the", "10:44", "most dangerous and one of the most in", "10:47", "terms of special operations one of the", "10:50", "most significant in in in all of", "10:53", "military in this country right yeah I", "10:55", "think the the old-school guys the", "10:57", "old-school operators out of the teams", "10:58", "are definitely like yeah just shut your", "11:01", "pie-holes", "11:01", "don't talk about yeah the newer guys", "11:03", "again because they came up in a", "11:05", "different time right I mean information", "11:06", "flows all around as much", "11:08", "easier and quicker than it did in the", "11:09", "70s and 80s and you know early 90s but", "11:13", "nowadays people are just used to reading", "11:15", "everything as soon as it happens and I", "11:17", "creates a different mindset so the", "11:18", "younger guys in there", "11:19", "they don't necessarily view it the same", "11:22", "way I didn't even think about it until", "11:24", "the dick marchenko books came out those", "11:26", "were a long time was a long time ago", "11:27", "yeah that's when I really was like wow I", "11:29", "can't they wear regular clothes", "11:31", "I mean I'm I mean I think I was like", "11:34", "probably 18 or 19 when those books were", "11:36", "out and I remember thinking what it this", "11:38", "is crazy wear long hair and they dress", "11:40", "like hippies it's just normal and go out", "11:42", "and invade go ahead vade just invading", "11:46", "hippies but I know they would get I mean", "11:48", "marchenko is famous for wanting his guys", "11:50", "to get drunk together too before like", "11:52", "big things yeah", "11:54", "well it's it's an idea team-building", "11:56", "camaraderie yeah and however you do it", "11:57", "but there was there was that sense that", "12:00", "we do it and it's off the radar yeah", "12:03", "it's not talked about yeah and we take", "12:05", "pride in that but again I'll go back to", "12:07", "the same thing if if like Bob gates you", "12:11", "know Bob gates writes a book you know a", "12:12", "former director of the agency and he's a", "12:14", "brilliant guy great guy but he writes a", "12:16", "book and you know and then you get", "12:18", "somebody else maybe Mike Morell writes a", "12:20", "book and so from you know inside the CIA", "12:22", "you got a lot of officers going well", "12:23", "shed maybe when I get out I'll write a", "12:26", "book because what I'm doing is pretty", "12:27", "damn interesting and there's no laws", "12:28", "against that", "12:29", "well there there are that's in and you", "12:32", "know anybody who reveals sources and", "12:34", "methods anybody who who breaks their", "12:37", "agreement in terms of the proper", "12:39", "handling which is a lifetime agreement", "12:41", "of classified information there's", "12:43", "supposed to be consequences and", "12:44", "sometimes there are and sometimes if", "12:46", "you're senior enough maybe there's not", "12:47", "but yeah you you know you sign a piece", "12:51", "of paper at the very beginning I'll", "12:52", "never forget that I read it you know and", "12:54", "I said ok good it was such keep your Yap", "12:58", "shut", "12:58", "I mean I don't want oversimplify it but", "13:00", "it says you're being given the", "13:02", "responsibility of handling extremely", "13:05", "sensitive information and information", "13:06", "that that if released can easily result", "13:10", "in the loss of life I mean it's as", "13:11", "simple as that essentially and your", "13:14", "obligation is to shut your mouth and not", "13:16", "talk about sources and methods and", "13:18", "things that you know better not to talk", "13:20", "about and", "13:21", "but I think that the kind of the drip", "13:23", "drip drip right of the books and the", "13:25", "things that come out and there and the", "13:27", "anonymous sources like the New York", "13:28", "Times can write a an entire front page", "13:31", "article based on nothing but anonymous", "13:32", "sources nowadays never used to have them", "13:35", "right okay you know editors would sit", "13:36", "there and go hey you know you better get", "13:38", "yourself some additional you know", "13:39", "sources right and that we can discuss so", "13:41", "people can put it in context nowadays", "13:43", "that's not the case why do you think", "13:44", "that is I think I don't know I word part", "13:51", "of it is low standards low ilysm yeah I", "13:53", "think lower standards I think", "13:54", "competition I think the desire to get", "13:57", "information out there quickly because", "13:58", "every journalist is now playing beat the", "14:01", "clock with everybody who's got a", "14:03", "smartphone right and fancies themselves", "14:05", "a blogger or a journalist on Twitter or", "14:08", "whatever so they're all they're all", "14:09", "doing this and I think it's just this", "14:12", "idea right that says I it reminds me of", "14:16", "me I had a meeting with with my company", "14:20", "diligence for all your information and", "14:22", "security needs and it was with a major", "14:25", "multinational corporation and I was", "14:27", "meeting with their head of security and", "14:28", "some other folks and they do a lot of", "14:31", "work overseas and some very difficult", "14:32", "places and the competition that they", "14:35", "face in their sector is huge and so we", "14:37", "went in there and we thought this would", "14:39", "be great there's a lot of things we can", "14:40", "do for them in terms of gathering", "14:41", "information preventing them from making", "14:43", "mistakes as they're going into a new", "14:44", "market all of these things and the", "14:46", "bottom line was they said they looked at", "14:48", "me and I said now you know what", "14:49", "competitions so fierce we're just gonna", "14:52", "go in if we make mistakes we'll clean it", "14:54", "up later", "14:54", "and they were willing to do that it's", "14:56", "like acceptable lost credit card fraud", "14:58", "loss you know for MasterCard or whomever", "15:00", "they're willing to accept millions and", "15:02", "millions and millions of dollars as", "15:04", "acceptable loss for the cost of doing", "15:06", "business and so it's a little bit like", "15:09", "that I think with journalism they're", "15:10", "willing to just throw shit out there and", "15:12", "hey if they have to make a retraction", "15:14", "fine but it compromises the way a person", "15:16", "like myself views the news I mean look I", "15:19", "hate to quote Trump but when he he's", "15:22", "like parrots that fake news term over", "15:25", "and over again you if you are a person", "15:28", "who's or an organization that's being", "15:30", "accused of lying it seems to me you", "15:33", "should", "15:34", "really dot your i's and cross your T's", "15:36", "from then on out I mean you're being", "15:37", "accused of lying by the president and I", "15:40", "think it responsibly accused I mean the", "15:42", "way he does it he does it to avoid", "15:44", "questions that make him uncomfortable I", "15:46", "mean and as the president I just don't", "15:48", "think you should be able to do that", "15:49", "right you can't point to someone from", "15:50", "CNN and your fake news yeah like wow it", "15:53", "smells right it serves no purpose for", "15:56", "the press that I agree with the other", "15:57", "percent I so much of what this", "15:58", "administration does is a self-inflicted", "16:00", "wound right and and part of it is is is", "16:03", "that they're just crap and messaging", "16:05", "part of it is this idea that you know he", "16:06", "just says what's on his mind and he does", "16:08", "yeah it's almost like he's got", "16:10", "Tourette's but I think he views it as a", "16:11", "strength he views it as a reason why he", "16:13", "got elected and a lot of people out", "16:15", "there think yeah that's his base you", "16:18", "know the people they're really behind", "16:19", "him no matter what I think they view it", "16:20", "as part of his charm as well and the", "16:23", "problem is he does release classified", "16:25", "information sometimes yeah we've had", "16:28", "that problem with several", "16:31", "administrations they just don't know", "16:33", "what to not say well I think part of it", "16:36", "again is yeah there's there's a laxness", "16:39", "that's developed over the years and I", "16:41", "don't know why right because you know I", "16:44", "mean I think about all various security", "16:45", "issues we face and look we've been a war", "16:47", "for you know 17 years right since 9/11", "16:49", "and all these things that have been", "16:51", "happening to us you would think that", "16:52", "we'd be pretty buttoned up but now every", "16:54", "administration has had its moment where", "16:56", "it's let slip and whether it was the", "16:58", "press secretary whether it was somebody", "16:59", "rushing to the podium it was somebody on", "17:00", "Capitol Hill I mean they're famous for", "17:02", "it up there you know congressmen and", "17:04", "congresswomen or senators all in the in", "17:07", "the rush to get in front of the camera", "17:09", "to talk about something and then you", "17:11", "know shit happens things get out that it", "17:12", "shouldn't so I think it's it it all kind", "17:15", "of contributes to this mentality that we", "17:17", "started off talking about with with the", "17:19", "seals where you know they're you know", "17:21", "why are we in this point where people", "17:22", "are writing books and maybe getting", "17:24", "outside the box and I think it's just", "17:26", "because yeah it's this constant drip and", "17:28", "lowering of standards like you mentioned", "17:30", "I think and it's I don't think we walk", "17:32", "that dog bag I don't you know it's just", "17:34", "the way it is now you're not in the", "17:36", "agency anymore but I'm sure you stayed", "17:38", "tight with people that are still there", "17:39", "what what is the attitude now with this", "17:43", "administration like what they're doing", "17:45", "with like his the way he attack", "17:47", "the FBI and the wait just seems it seems", "17:51", "so reckless yeah it's it's uh it's", "17:56", "unusual I mean that look like okay this", "17:59", "here's the way I feel but I didn't vote", "18:01", "for for the president I didn't vote for", "18:03", "Hillary Clinton", "18:04", "I didn't think either were more than you", "18:07", "know the best we could do in a country", "18:08", "of over 300 million we've talked about", "18:10", "that for that was you or I that did what", "18:13", "Hillary did would be in jail yeah", "18:14", "exactly yeah and so but as far as you", "18:18", "know what the the current mood inside", "18:19", "the agency is I mean if you talk to some", "18:21", "former folks they you know they they'll", "18:23", "say uh morale is awful that was terrible", "18:26", "and you know they just say you just you", "18:28", "know hating life because there's no I I", "18:29", "don't find that I find that the frankly", "18:34", "they just more focused on operational", "18:36", "concerns and priorities and tasking than", "18:38", "anything else", "18:39", "everybody's got a personal opinion right", "18:41", "but I do think that the agency has", "18:43", "proven itself over the years at being", "18:45", "better at pushing that down and", "18:49", "understanding and in part because it's a", "18:50", "smaller organization right then most of", "18:52", "them then almost all of them and but", "18:56", "he's an he's not he doesn't go out to", "18:58", "the CIA right he's only gone after the", "18:59", "FBI", "19:00", "he's got the FBI I mean he's you know", "19:01", "he's questioned he's done he's done some", "19:02", "things in terms of questioning CIA", "19:04", "analysis and and and you know some of", "19:07", "the advice and guidance that they've", "19:10", "provided but that again you sort of look", "19:12", "at and go hey look we're feeding this", "19:14", "into the NSC the National Security", "19:15", "Council you guys you know that's that's", "19:18", "that's an editorial process at that", "19:19", "point you guys are gonna have to make", "19:20", "your decisions you know people are gonna", "19:23", "say I'm just saying this because I'm", "19:25", "subjective and I you know I'm providing", "19:26", "top cover for the agency but for the", "19:28", "most part they just focus on getting", "19:30", "shit done and we also have the benefit", "19:32", "of big focused overseas so we're not", "19:34", "like the Bureau is you know it's a", "19:36", "domestic organization right so they you", "19:38", "know they're drawn in the agencies got", "19:40", "the advantage of look we're having to", "19:42", "deal with crap over there right not here", "19:44", "so now what did you think when he said", "19:48", "they were gonna pull out of Syria well", "19:51", "first of all yeah yeah they just had", "19:54", "that we've lost some servicemen up in", "19:57", "northern Syria today", "19:59", "today as a result of a bombing up there", "20:01", "yeah Isis is taking credit for it so", "20:03", "there-there was a Patrol we've got", "20:06", "roughly 2,000 personnel in Syria and for", "20:10", "the most part what are they doing there", "20:12", "what they're providing guidance training", "20:14", "they're assisting with targeting and", "20:18", "because the the airpower is incredibly", "20:21", "important over there right now and so we", "20:23", "are our personnel are very much involved", "20:28", "in selection of identification of", "20:30", "targets for the air campaign and so we", "20:35", "have these two thousand troops their", "20:37", "president says he's gonna withdraw and", "20:38", "then then some of the members of the", "20:40", "administration start walking that dog", "20:41", "back right and saying all right I may", "20:43", "not happen right away but yeah they just", "20:46", "a routine patrol if there's never really", "20:49", "such thing as a routine patrol but", "20:51", "there's a patrol and it got hit the", "20:54", "military is not releasing a lot of", "20:56", "details because they haven't finished", "20:57", "notifying next to Ken but numbers so far", "21:01", "indicate possibly four service men lost", "21:06", "and that's going to refocus I think", "21:10", "Congress and hopefully the White House", "21:12", "on what the hell's going on the problem", "21:15", "I've got with it is in terms of", "21:19", "withdrawing look we could stay there", "21:21", "forever and not accomplish the task", "21:24", "right if the task is to finally defeat", "21:27", "whatever that means radical Islam", "21:30", "jihadists Isis that shit's never gonna", "21:36", "happen we're not in our lifetimes we're", "21:38", "not going to get rid of that mentality", "21:39", "that that ideology the sort of what", "21:43", "seems to be sometimes a bottomless well", "21:44", "of recruits that they can draw on their", "21:47", "ability to morph into something else as", "21:49", "al Qaeda did over depending on you know", "21:52", "how successful we are in a campaign", "21:54", "against them they're like you know again", "21:56", "it's a it's it's you know it's like you", "21:58", "know you step on roaches over here and", "21:59", "they pop up over here so I think it's", "22:03", "the the biggest problem I've got is is", "22:06", "that if we leave we're not we're not you", "22:11", "know it's not like we're engaged in fire", "22:13", "fights every day with Isis over there", "22:15", "right we've left that to our allies and", "22:17", "our allies in most part up there in the", "22:20", "north of Syria are the Kurds and the", "22:22", "Kurds have been our allies in one way or", "22:24", "another in that part of the world for a", "22:26", "long time now and it played a very", "22:28", "important role and we have not been", "22:31", "particularly honorable over the over the", "22:33", "years in terms of how sometimes we deal", "22:34", "with them if we walk out if we leave", "22:37", "then", "22:39", "Dajuan you know ahead of Turkey I", "22:43", "guarantee you we'll be in there in short", "22:45", "order to kill as many of them as", "22:47", "possible because that's just what the", "22:50", "Turkish authorities are going to do they", "22:53", "honestly they're they couldn't be", "22:56", "happier with the announcement that we're", "22:57", "gonna leave because that opens the door", "22:59", "for them to then go in there and from", "23:02", "their perspective stamp out the Kurdish", "23:04", "alliance that have been our allies were", "23:07", "the only thing our presence that small", "23:08", "presence you know not minimizing it but", "23:10", "you know 2,000 troops has been what's", "23:12", "prevented them from doing that so that's", "23:15", "that's the number one issue I've got the", "23:17", "other is I have no idea why any", "23:20", "president or vice president or anybody", "23:23", "in in the government ever not this", "23:25", "administration or any administration", "23:26", "ever thinks it's a it's a good idea to", "23:29", "say we've defeated the enemy when we're", "23:32", "talking about radical Islam we've seen", "23:34", "it over and over again from previous", "23:36", "administration from the Bush", "23:37", "administration every time they say you", "23:38", "know we've done it mission accomplished", "23:40", "mission accomplished I would be beaten", "23:42", "al Qaeda or we beat nicest it's there's", "23:45", "no upside to saying that shut the fuck", "23:47", "up stop saying things like that it's", "23:49", "again it's a self-inflicted wound at the", "23:50", "because now what's happening yeah the", "23:53", "media is not focused on the fact that", "23:54", "we've lost servicemen they're focused on", "23:56", "well just just the other day the", "23:58", "president said we defeated Isis and the", "24:00", "vice president today said the same thing", "24:01", "now look what's happened there's no", "24:04", "benefit to saying that and it's not", "24:07", "going to happen anyway so so the goal of", "24:10", "being over there is to assist our allies", "24:12", "but also to make sure that these Radical", "24:15", "factions don't become more powerful and", "24:18", "then eventually affect us and attack us", "24:21", "so we can keep an eye on what they're", "24:23", "planning what they're doing is that yes", "24:25", "that an accurate", "24:26", "yeah it is it's it's it's exactly it I", "24:28", "mean if you look at the reason we went", "24:31", "into Afghanistan and if we go back all", "24:33", "the host years only shut and that was", "24:40", "because the Taliban allowed al-qaeda to", "24:44", "establish a beachhead in there for", "24:47", "training and for communications and for", "24:50", "finance and for plotting and planning", "24:52", "attacks outside of Afghanistan against", "24:54", "us and our allies that's why we went in", "24:58", "there aside from just seeking revenge", "25:00", "obviously was to route that out we then", "25:04", "stayed you know thinking somehow we were", "25:07", "going to turn the tide of history and", "25:08", "create some pseudo federal democracy", "25:10", "right so that didn't that didn't work", "25:12", "but the reason now for being in Syria is", "25:16", "yes we we have done a very solid job of", "25:21", "beating back Isis removing their", "25:23", "territory and degrading their ability to", "25:26", "operate but we haven't stamped them out", "25:28", "we haven't defeated them yet they're", "25:29", "still there and so we've been providing", "25:32", "the support and again in the form of", "25:34", "weapons hardware gear of resources", "25:36", "training and most importantly combat air", "25:41", "operations air assaults and that's been", "25:45", "critically important if we leave I have", "25:50", "no doubt that Isis will find some way to", "25:53", "rejuvenate maybe not in its current form", "25:55", "but and maybe not in the same exact", "25:57", "locations but they'll morph because", "25:58", "that's what they do they just they just", "26:00", "find a way to adapt and we already know", "26:03", "what's happened in the past when we when", "26:04", "we left Iraq we saw what happened with", "26:05", "the rise of Isis so you know I the do I", "26:10", "want to stay there forever absolutely", "26:11", "not but both sides can make a valid", "26:14", "argument one for staying one for leaving", "26:17", "my I think the best argument for staying", "26:20", "in the in certainly a short midterm is", "26:22", "to ensure that Iran doesn't slaughter a", "26:24", "bunch of Kurds who have been working", "26:25", "with us", "26:26", "honorably you know I don't know how else", "26:31", "to say that so we'll see what happens is", "26:33", "the best argument to stay is to protect", "26:36", "the people that helped us", "26:37", "to protect our allies yeah yeah so it's", "26:40", "not in our best interest is in the best", "26:41", "interest of our commitment and our", "26:43", "agreement with them well is it in our", "26:47", "national security interest to stay in", "26:49", "Syria for example look right there was", "26:51", "this there's so many levels to this", "26:53", "thing and I'm sure right now everybody's", "26:54", "listening going off fucksake he's not", "26:56", "gonna disappear down the rabbit hole but", "26:57", "but yes I am it for a while there there", "27:01", "was just this this idea this was", "27:03", "ridiculous pie in the sky thought that", "27:05", "we were gonna get the Russians out of", "27:06", "Syria never gonna fucking happen", "27:09", "Russians said the only port for their", "27:12", "Black Sea Fleet is in Syria yeah they've", "27:15", "been there for decades and decades along", "27:17", "with Iran", "27:17", "we're net we it's not going to happen", "27:19", "unless we want to go to war with Russia", "27:21", "to kick them out of Syria that's not in", "27:22", "our best interest so is it in our", "27:24", "national security interest to keep", "27:26", "troops there to fight and try to", "27:27", "minimize Russian involvement in Syria I", "27:29", "don't think so", "27:31", "because we're not gonna shift them off", "27:32", "that dime without going directly at them", "27:35", "right it's in their best interest to", "27:37", "stay and every nation acts in its own", "27:39", "best interest are we going to shift Iran", "27:41", "are we going to keep Iran from forming", "27:43", "from too late for that they've already", "27:45", "got a beachhead there that they're not", "27:46", "going to give up and so you got to set", "27:49", "those issues aside say well what the", "27:51", "hell are we doing there oh we are we", "27:53", "there simply because we have to you know", "27:56", "finish the fight against Isis well you", "28:00", "know at some point you gotta say you", "28:02", "know I guess I wouldn't say that we've", "28:04", "defeated them but I think we would say", "28:06", "yeah we've degraded them sufficiently", "28:07", "that we can we can now operate from", "28:09", "elsewhere you know we can operate from", "28:12", "forward bases in other locations where", "28:14", "we're currently you know based great but", "28:17", "again I keep coming back to the same", "28:18", "thing that you know we've we've worked", "28:20", "with the Kurds is this in our national", "28:22", "security interest well no I guess it's", "28:24", "not but there's something that tells me", "28:26", "it's the right thing to do and and maybe", "28:29", "sometimes that's enough you know that we", "28:31", "should we should not let Iran have his", "28:33", "way and also long term wouldn't it be in", "28:36", "our best interest to honor our", "28:38", "commitment and make sure that we protect", "28:40", "our allies so that in the future other", "28:43", "allies would be more willing to", "28:45", "cooperate with us because they", "28:47", "understand that once we're committed", "28:49", "were fully committed and we", "28:51", "yeah and we stand for something yeah so", "28:53", "what's the benefit of getting out like", "28:55", "the people that think we should get out", "28:57", "like wouldn't when Trump said he wanted", "28:59", "to pull out like what's his thinking I", "29:00", "don't think it runs particularly deep I", "29:03", "think it's just I think it's you know", "29:04", "during the campaign he talked about you", "29:06", "know stopping the endless wars well", "29:08", "that's a very popular concept right no", "29:10", "again nobody what the hell I mean and so", "29:12", "it will be interesting to see you know", "29:14", "what today's sad you know event does up", "29:17", "on Capitol Hill you know do they they", "29:20", "rethink their the the withdrawal order", "29:22", "they accelerated like when they had the", "29:25", "buildup in Iraq and it was highly", "29:28", "criticized but then it was very", "29:29", "effective like it did do what they", "29:31", "intended it to do right and did knock", "29:34", "back the enemy if they decided to ramp", "29:39", "it up", "29:39", "worldwide would that be a solution to", "29:43", "any of this or is the opposite is it", "29:46", "better to actually ramp up our defenses", "29:48", "domestically and just stay the fuck away", "29:51", "from all these people", "29:52", "yeah well eventually he can only I mean", "29:55", "you can only do so much I think on the", "29:57", "domestic front and then you know if if", "30:02", "they gain sufficient ability and", "30:04", "strength and we've seen that from past", "30:06", "attacks I think then then they'll come", "30:08", "after you they'll come after us and", "30:10", "that's just the way I suppose that's", "30:13", "going to work but I don't disagree with", "30:15", "the notion because it is hard pressed I", "30:18", "look I wouldn't have stayed in", "30:19", "Afghanistan frankly I don't care whether", "30:21", "they've increased their literacy rate by", "30:23", "2% or built another road or whatever", "30:25", "doesn't matter they don't they don't", "30:26", "know what the hell we're trying to sell", "30:27", "them right so I don't I'm not against", "30:30", "the notion of getting out but this one's", "30:33", "a tough one I guess that's what I'm", "30:35", "saying is is that the Syria issue is I'm", "30:37", "real conflicted on because of the Kurds", "30:38", "and and what they've done on our behalf", "30:40", "in the past and how they've suffered and", "30:42", "knowing going years and years back you", "30:46", "know having dealt with that issue two", "30:49", "and a half decades ago a long time ago", "30:51", "with the Turks and the Kurds knowing how", "30:54", "vicious that could be and I don't trust", "30:57", "her to want as far as I could throw them", "30:58", "out a window so you know I think there's", "31:01", "a problem there that we need to we need", "31:03", "to make sure we've talked through", "31:04", "thoroughly", "31:05", "before we just say sure let's get him", "31:07", "out of there you know what the hell you", "31:09", "know we shouldn't have him there we", "31:10", "shouldn't be there but like everything", "31:13", "else so it gets kids it's complicated", "31:14", "you would like to think that what", "31:15", "they're having conversations like this", "31:16", "up on Capitol Hill right you know", "31:18", "between the the parties Republicans and", "31:21", "the demonsaw my especially a guy like", "31:28", "Trump if Trump is the guy who's decided", "31:30", "we're gonna pull out us area like how", "31:33", "does he have enough time to carefully", "31:35", "consider that as well as all the other", "31:40", "things that are on his plate yeah and", "31:42", "when someone runs for president save", "31:45", "someone's campaigning and they say you", "31:47", "know where I support a non", "31:49", "interventionist foreign policy I'm gonna", "31:51", "get us out of these these wars I'm gonna", "31:53", "get they're doing this based on a", "31:56", "limited amount of information like it's", "31:58", "not like the CIA or the FBI or anybody", "32:01", "briefs them as they're running for", "32:03", "president they don't have clearance", "32:05", "right right right until you become the", "32:07", "Party nominee right so when you're the", "32:10", "party nominee then do you get a", "32:11", "discussion you get you get some access", "32:13", "right it's not you're still not the", "32:15", "president right but you are given some", "32:17", "ability to get more intensive briefings", "32:20", "yeah yeah but it's not it's not to the", "32:23", "degree that the president so someone", "32:24", "like Hillary she was already Secretary", "32:26", "of State she already knew pretty much", "32:28", "most things yeah yeah she had she was", "32:31", "you know very switched on very informed", "32:35", "you know she was just an awful candidate", "32:37", "yeah sorry", "32:40", "I you know so I I think that look I", "32:45", "there's certain things that this", "32:46", "administration is doing foreign", "32:48", "policy-wise", "32:48", "that I think of good it makes sense", "32:51", "there are other things that I think you", "32:54", "know you just leave you scratching your", "32:55", "head but that's like every", "32:58", "administration I guess my point is we've", "33:00", "gotten away from that ability right I", "33:02", "have conversations I go out to dinner", "33:03", "with folks that you know on

that doesn't belong", "58:03", "or some sort of a backdoor or some sort", "58:05", "of a way that they could tap in it's", "58:07", "like if you were you know you were Apple", "58:09", "and you were

sense of like trying", "59:05", "to remember that the name of it but not", "59:07", "doing a very good job if you have access", "59:13", "to or understanding of physical Hardware", "59:17", "then you can affect easier you can", "59:21", "affect physical control of systems right", "59:25", "so Stuxnet remember I know if you", "59:27", "remember Stuxnet was exact it was an", "59:30", "attack on Iran to shut down their", "59:32", "nuclear program right exactly -", "59:34", "essentially what it did was it took over", "59:36", "control of some centrifuges over spun", "59:39", "them the heat broke

you this because", "60:40", "this is something that just came up and", "60:42", "we were trying to figure out it's", "60:44", "nonsense or not my friend Adam was here", "60:46", "the other day and

into a system and it would like take", "61:18", "that information that was on that piece", "61:19", "of paper and now it was on a database", "61:21", "that you could access and manipulate", "61:22", "right and so you know voice recognition", "61:24", "is no different and sense that so if if", "61:27", "if for example if I had this switched on", "61:30", "and it happens to people I'm sure all",

"62:26", "regular phone that you get if you just", "62:27", "buy an iPhone and you have Siri turned", "62:30", "on so you could say hey Siri and it", "62:32", "turns on that phone is always listening", "62:36", "to you well then now we're getting in", "62:39", "over my head but it could be I mean it", "62:41", "is is it possible is it capable of doing", "62:44", "that yes could you do that as an", "62:49", "intentional operation sure is it", "62:52", "happening because Apple wants to do it", "62:54", "and they want to get better", "62:55", "understanding of consumer preferences",

inundated with Toyota", "63:23", "mentions right afterwards so you know", "63:26", "it's it's like the next iteration of", "63:29", "that and I suspect that people would you", "63:36", "know some folks would be outraged but", "63:38", "I'll bet people would just live with it", "63:40", "yeah right we seem to be willing to give", "63:41", "up a lot of shit you know as long as we", "63:43", "don't think that government's doing it", "63:45", "right right if it's if it's Google if", "63:47", "it's Google and somebody we seem to be", "63:49", "fine with it", "63:50", "but if it's a fucking if it's that NSA", "63:52", "then our best but that's not who's", "63:55", "fucking making jack off of these things", "63:57", "right right so it's Amazon and angle and", "64:00", "all these companies

go overboard", "65:02", "if I start talking technical and someone", "65:04", "will call me out and say well it's not", "65:05", "exactly how it works but in simplistic", "65:08", "terms yeah it's it's an ability to", "65:10", "monitor pedestrian traffic to understand", "65:15", "you know people's interests and to", "65:18", "further refine so that they can sell a", "65:20", "shit better Mike your

know now it's now it's it's it's", "66:23", "it's pretty remarkable but you can also", "66:25", "think about the electronics that exist", "66:27", "in a current vehicle in a new vehicle", "66:29",

working on it now", "72:48", "that they develop some of it they're", "72:50", "working to get the next generation it's", "72:51", "like every nation that has the resources", "72:53", "and ability understands that and is", "72:55", "doing the same it's not like we're not", "72:56", "right what what is their excuse as they", "73:00", "should be they don't have an excuse they", "73:01", "just they understand their they have the", "73:03", "right to do it I mean it's not like they", "73:04", "they you know right as long as they", "73:06", "don't use it right in an illegal way", "73:08",

have", "73:35", "been cheating on a previous agreement", "73:37", "and so we're you know now they try to", "73:38", "say we're cheating on the new one and so", "73:40", "that's an interesting thing to be", "73:41", "watching but the point being is that you", "73:43", "know the there's conventions that try to", "73:45", "you know control the the numbers for", "73:48", "warheads or for delivery mechanisms", "73:51", "missiles or submarines or whatever", "73:53", "bombers but not for this new world cyber", "73:57", "space the Pentagon's still trying to", "73:58", "figure out what you know war means in", "74:02", "cyberspace", "74:03", "you know how do you respond what what", "74:05", "what's the threshold you know and then", "74:07", "what's an appropriate response and so", "74:10", "well maybe we'll get there maybe we'll", "74:12", "start having these discussions and", "74:13", "create treaties that will allow that but", "74:15", "right now from China's perspective again", "74:17", "not to beat on China but I'm much more", "74:19", "concerned about China for our national", "74:21", "security they're a much bigger concern", "74:23", "than Russia is Russia's punching above", "74:26", "its weight and Putin's you know Putin's", "74:28", "a dick no doubt about it", "74:29", "right and they've doing what they always", "74:31", "do which is metal and democracy that's", "74:33", "been their methodology for ever since", "74:35", "they've been around yeah but you know", "74:39", "that that's small potatoes they got the", "74:41", "GDP of a small European country you know", "74:44", "and when the oil prices you know are in", "74:46", "the toilet they really are sucking wind", "74:48", "so yeah we got to be concerned with", "74:50", "Russia and understand that their", "74:51", "interests are never aligned with ours", "74:53", "you know for the most part maybe we", "74:55", "tried to imagine they were with Syria", "74:57", "and Isis and everything but Russia's", "74:59", "only interested air was maintaining", "75:00", "their leverage and increasing it and not", "75:02", "not losing their military foothold there", "75:04", "that was their primary interest we", "75:07", "mirror our values and we mirror our", "75:09", "interests on other countries and so we", "75:11", "imagined it somehow we're all in this", "75:12", "fight against Isis together yeah", "75:14", "horseshit", "75:15", "you know so so China is a much bigger", "75:19", "issue and we and we should be focused on", "75:21", "that and to some degree this", "75:23", "administration is so that's where I say", "75:25", "look you can't just keep complaining and", "75:27", "bitching and moaning because you don't", "75:29", "like President Trump there's certain", "75:31", "things that are going on that you should", "75:32", "be", "75:32", "willing to say that okay that makes", "75:34", "sense maybe I don't like the messenger", "75:36", "but that part of it makes sense", "75:38", "is it his personal life I mean is it", "75:41", "because of his dealings with China from", "75:44", "the business world that he understands", "75:45", "it better that he's more concerned with", "75:48", "the imbalance of the the trade I think", "75:52", "what happened was what do I know and", "75:54", "this is speculation so hey but I suspect", "75:56", "that what happened was he came into it", "75:59", "focused on the trade imbalance right and", "76:02", "as he was sitting there and talking", "76:05", "about the trade imbalance more of the", "76:07", "conversation from the National Security", "76:09", "Council and from the agency and others", "76:11", "in terms of saying well yeah this is", "76:13", "part of the reason why and this is the", "76:15", "long-term effects of their theft of", "76:17", "intellectual property this is why in", "76:18", "part they've been successful in these", "76:20", "areas so I think there was probably more", "76:22", "and more discussion talking about their", "76:25", "economic espionage and theft of IP and", "76:27", "that became then an issue for him but I", "76:31", "think initially and still to this day I", "76:33", "think the big issue is just he wants to", "76:35", "try to create a win in terms of the", "76:38", "trade imbalance Russia seems to us here", "76:41", "domestically Lee speaking from for", "76:44", "myself when when I think about it and I", "76:46", "think about the the narrative that's", "76:48", "been sort of delivered to us that Russia", "76:51", "is this military danger we're worried", "76:53", "about Putin taking over other countries", "76:56", "were worried about Putin's power the way", "76:59", "he kills dissidents the way he kills", "77:01", "political opponents and journalists we", "77:04", "think about China and even with the", "77:07", "Huawei arrests we're like no one seems", "77:10", "to be concerned it doesn't seem to light", "77:12", "any bulbs over here yeah no you're right", "77:15", "I don't know why that is except you know", "77:17", "Putin's more like a thug you know he's a", "77:19", "visual right right and also I mean look", "77:22", "he's he's been very clear about you know", "77:24", "wanting to try to rebuild the Soviet", "77:26", "Union so whether it's Crimea and the", "77:27", "annexation of that or whether taking", "77:29", "over eastern Ukraine and you know or", "77:32", "maintaining a position in Georgia", "77:34", "whatever it is he you know certainly you", "77:38", "know his attacks or the FSB s attacks", "77:41", "overseas against you know dissidents and", "77:43", "others yeah he's just more in-your-face", "77:46", "he's like Tony Soprano right and so you", "77:48", "can look at that China has always been", "77:50", "you know sort of this thing right and", "77:52", "China's fantastic the history is amazing", "77:54", "you know the places are incredible", "77:57", "III think it's you know we should be", "77:59", "trading with China we should be doing a", "78:00", "huge amount of business with China we", "78:02", "should you know clear the text and try", "78:03", "to degree we can level the playing field", "78:05", "but we should also be pragmatic and", "78:07", "realize what they do you know in terms", "78:09", "of their their theft of IP and so you", "78:13", "know because that again I probably won't", "78:14", "change but yeah we absolutely should be", "78:16", "dealing with China all the time but I", "78:19", "think that they've always kind of been", "78:20", "viewed more and more of a sophisticated", "78:23", "fashion maybe because Putin is just sort", "78:25", "of in-your-face and he's you know he's", "78:28", "good at it he's very successful", "78:29", "he's a smart son of a bitch but he's I", "78:32", "think he's pretty easy to read right", "78:33", "he's thuggish and he you know he longs", "78:38", "for those days of the Soviet Union so we", "78:41", "should understand that everything he", "78:42", "does is because of that it's because", "78:45", "he's he he would love to rebuild the", "78:47", "Soviet Union and so we shouldn't be", "78:49", "surprised by any sort of you know", "78:51", "aggressive move that he makes against", "78:53", "his his neighbors and we should always", "78:55", "push back and to be fair this", "79:00", "administration not to beat their drum", "79:03", "but the actions they've taken against", "79:06", "Russia despite the fact that you've got", "79:08", "people calling him a puppet of Putin are", "79:11", "more significant than the previous", "79:13", "administration took look what has he", "79:14", "done the sanctions against you know key", "79:18", "individuals and companies within Russia", "79:20", "as an example those are the toughest", "79:21", "sanctions you know have been placed on", "79:22", "Russia ever the provision of weapons and", "79:26", "an assistance to the Ukrainians all", "79:29", "right that was some of the previous", "79:30", "administration said no not gonna do that", "79:32", "you know because we don't we don't want", "79:34", "any blowback that's that's a good thing", "79:37", "right that should be done pushing back", "79:41", "against them on the on the 2011 nuke", "79:43", "deal right and or sorry on the under the", "79:46", "previous on the start deal prior to the", "79:48", "2011 deal and calling them out and", "79:50", "saying look you're cheating on this and", "79:51", "you you know you got to be held", "79:54", "accountable I mean there's certain", "79:56", "things there that that may", "79:58", "sense then that don't add up if you talk", "80:02", "to somebody who says well he's an", "80:03", "absolute puppet you say well okay he's a", "80:04", "puppet so why or is he doing certain", "80:06", "things that seem counter to Russian", "80:09", "interests and they'll say well because", "80:11", "he's smart and he's like you just want", "80:13", "to get caught out I see its he's playing", "80:15", "he's playing a long game here and and", "80:18", "I'm thinking okay maybe maybe who knows", "80:22", "but I haven't I haven't strapped on my", "80:24", "tinfoil hat yet to get to that point so", "80:27", "I don't know yeah that seems they're", "80:29", "complicated one if they have some", "80:31", "compromising information about that was", "80:33", "always the fear right is that they knew", "80:35", "something or yeah maybe it was business", "80:37", "dealings maybe it was people peeing on", "80:40", "them or yeah okay if that if they had if", "80:42", "they did not and again anything in", "80:45", "today's world anything's possible", "80:46", "right right and I wish we had somebody", "80:49", "else in there who was more elegant and", "80:50", "eloquent and sophisticated there's", "80:52", "anybody not right now no I don't think", "80:58", "anybody's gonna challenge him from the", "80:59", "Republican side and on the Democratic", "81:00", "side I think they're gonna get eighteen", "81:02", "or twenty you know potential candidates", "81:04", "in there and end up beating their own", "81:06", "and so it could be it could be a real", "81:08", "you know slugfest and turn each other as", "81:11", "they're trying to establish someone", "81:13", "who's a viable candidate kind of like", "81:14", "what the Republicans did right he ended", "81:16", "up with you know we ended up with", "81:17", "President Trump and you know the", "81:20", "Democrats if they're not careful you can", "81:22", "end up with the same thing look they're", "81:23", "talking about Joe Biden I tobin's an", "81:25", "excellent cat rice 150 years old hundred", "81:27", "fifty years old and he lost twice before", "81:29", "yeah but everybody loves the person", "81:30", "that's on the bench right right until", "81:32", "they get in the game and so you know who", "81:35", "knows where they're gonna go with that", "81:36", "but you know could they had this idea", "81:40", "that they've got compromising", "81:41", "information on them here's here's what I", "81:46", "think is that if Muller has figured this", "81:50", "out right and it's been quiet about it", "81:52", "and they then the most remarkable thing", "81:54", "about this investigation will be that", "81:57", "nobody leaked because you can't keep a", "82:01", "secret in Washington and so the fact", "82:03", "that for two years now we don't have", "82:05", "like that that that bullet you know that", "82:09", "they think they're going to come up with", "82:10", "at some point", "82:11", "my inclination is to think that you know", "82:13", "mullahs gonna finish this investigation", "82:15", "issue some findings and nobody's going", "82:17", "to be happy because there won't be a", "82:19", "bullet and so the left won't be happy", "82:21", "the right won't be happy because he'll", "82:23", "still be pointing out the fact that", "82:24", "there was you know a lot of you know", "82:26", "stupid moves on the campaigns part and", "82:28", "that there was inappropriate activity by", "82:30", "you know people like manna fort and", "82:31", "others but do I think there's gonna be", "82:35", "some smoking gun I don't I don't think", "82:37", "so because and my reason for saying that", "82:39", "is because I've never known Washington", "82:40", "not be able to keep our - to be able to", "82:43", "keep a secret right this is one like new", "82:44", "or ever done one of these things before", "82:46", "though he seems uniquely calculated yeah", "82:48", "he's done this before", "82:49", "and and he has he said look he's a very", "82:52", "smart guy and a very seasoned operator", "82:54", "investigator and he's got good people", "82:56", "working for him and it's absolutely", "82:58", "correct to let him go with this and just", "83:00", "let him finish it up right but when is", "83:04", "that gonna be who knows right nobody we", "83:06", "have they've been talking about all he's", "83:07", "gonna wrap it up next week he's gonna", "83:08", "wrap it up this week he's gonna know", "83:10", "he's not you know he'll you know you", "83:12", "think he's gonna wrap it up who knows", "83:14", "hey this guy this literally could go on", "83:15", "to into it's gonna have to end before", "83:18", "probably end of this year I don't think", "83:20", "even he's gonna want to for political", "83:21", "calculations let it go into too close to", "83:24", "2020 in the election right so regardless", "83:27", "even though I don't think he's a big ly", "83:28", "political individual I think he's gonna", "83:30", "see that the wisdom of wrapping it up", "83:32", "before then and then letting the chips", "83:34", "fall wherever they do what's astonishing", "83:36", "to me is how anytime something does come", "83:39", "out on Trump it just seems to slide", "83:41", "right off yeah yeah well that is true", "83:44", "that is raising because I think what's", "83:46", "happening is they're just throwing",

that we do the initial", "127:34", "selection there's there's you know", "127:35", "there's a lot of things I suppose sure", "127:38", "the fact you have to be registered as a", "127:39", "Democrat or

he's figured out", "128:11", "how to avoid the stress yeah it seemed", "128:13", "in the old yeah oh you remember what", "128:14", "present Obama looked like when he", "128:15", "finally walked out of office or Bill", "128:17", "Clinton I saw Bill Clinton not too long", "128:18", "ago we went down a little rock and you", "128:21", "saw him yeah he was at an event that we", "128:23", "were is a

smart", "128:58", "son of a bitch and he I just found him", "129:03", "you know capable of the job right I just", "129:06", "like I did with President Bush and you", "129:07", "know there were good aspects of", "129:09", "President Obama like I don't have a dog", "129:10", "in the hunt right I mean I'd rather see", "129:12", "the results in the person but anyway", "129:14", "talking to President Clinton he we", "129:16", "started talking and he immediately went", "129:19", "to a agency operation an old thing that", "129:24", "had happened during his time when he was", "129:26", "president to talk about it I and and you", "129:30", "could tell that he I mean he had", "129:31", "retained a tremendous amount of", "129:33", "information right and we were talking", "129:35", "and and we ended up talking for 15", "129:37", "minutes or so just kind of about this", "129:39", "particular incident and he was kind of", "129:40", "curious and he wanted to you know and he", "129:42", "wanted to recount kind of some of the", "129:43", "thought process that they were you know", "129:45", "going through and and I found it really", "129:47", "interesting in the sense that that was", "129:48", "it it was a surprisingly deep", "129:51", "conversation right for some and he's", "129:55", "curious and I always thought that was", "129:57", "the most important quality for anybody", "129:58", "who gets in that job is he they have to", "130:01", "be curious right they have to be", "130:02", "inquisitive", "130:03", "and you know on the scale of you know", "130:07", "presidents where does the current", "130:09", "president you know exist in the", "130:10", "curiosity scale I don't know but I think", "130:12", "that's probably not his strong suit so", "130:14", "maybe that's one of the reasons why he's", "130:15", "not aging is because he he's you know", "130:18", "he's not asking that fourth or fifth", "130:19", "question that leads you to the point", "130:21", "where you go huh it's a pretty fucked up", "130:22", "situation now we got to worry about that", "130:23", "one yeah so maybe it is you know water", "130:26", "off the back and he's and he's he's", "130:29", "figured

"regulations that they've done that they", "130:48", "haven't really touted in terms of", "130:50", "deregulating", "130:51", "some of the things that make us like the", "130:52", "previous administration you know a lot", "130:54", "of good points but some bad points one", "130:56", "of the bad points was sort of the", "130:59", "hamstringing of industry through", "131:01", "over-regulation yes on everything right", "131:04", "and so lifting some of that on you know", "131:06", "there's this yeah you can argue whether", "131:09", "you know you want bigger government or", "131:10", "less government but you can't argue with", "131:12", "the fact that it did unleash you know", "131:14", "industry and business more than the", "131:17", "previous administration so that's a good", "131:19", "thing", "131:20", "but yeah look at all the other concerns", "131:22", "I mean now we're talking about it you", "131:24", "know a global slowdown okay because you", "131:26", "know

and and with the the Cuban", "133:29", "regime do I think that he had assistance", "133:35", "I don't you know I don't think so but I", "133:40", "could be swayed from that with with", "133:42", "better evidence than I've seen but I", "133:45", "understand why people are so delegating", "133:47", "on it right because I mean look it was a", "133:49", "massive event right it was a massive",

understand it", "133:59", "in today's terms but when you get right", "134:01", "in that position and look out that", "134:03", "window and look at the shot that was", "134:05", "taken and you know

Soviets were pulling the trigger on", "134:26", "to I think them off you were pulling the", "134:27", "trigger I I haven't seen anything that", "134:28", "convinces me that that was the case I", "134:30", "think that Ozma", "134:31", "felt like he was doing it for them or he", "134:33", "was going to prove himself in that", "134:35", "regard but again I I understand why", "134:39", "people have dug in the MLK one Martin", "134:40", "Luther King I just I think that I don't", "134:48", "think he acted alone what makes you", "134:50", "think that I think that look he was a", "134:55",

possibility but yeah MLK I", "136:08", "think is that's the one that's most", "136:10", "disturbing that's interesting I don't", "136:12", "know enough about the MLK murder I need", "136:14", "to go

that's the interesting for me", "136:56", "that's the most interesting part I mean", "136:58", "put it in context with everything he did", "136:59", "up until that point which was he was", "137:00", "basically again just a two-bit criminal", "137:02", "couldn't stay out of jail", "137:03", "and then you get this and you get this", "137:06", "change in behavior and this change in", "137:07",

"137:15", "was the most striking part for me", "137:18", "there's no obvious source of income no", "137:21", "no justjust just you know just again", "137:25", "just a penny any criminal basically and", "137:28", "there was plenty of information it", "137:30", "wasn't like he couldn't have gathered if", "137:31", "you say well no he acted on his own well", "137:33", "okay yeah was there
