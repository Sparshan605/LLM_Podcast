not that i didn't", "05:20", "want to talk to him about those things", "05:22", "it's just he was being uh i wouldn't say", "05:25", "he's evasive", "05:26", "but he was basically just saying what he", "05:29", "knew", "05:30", "based on the company policy i didn't", "05:32", "know what else", "05:33", "more to ask him and people felt like i", "05:35", "didn't press him hard enough", "05:37", "and he to his credit reached out to me", "05:40", "and said that he would offer to do", "05:43", "another one", "05:44", "to ask more questions that's cool and i", "05:45", "said that would be awesome so i", "05:47", "said well this is the thing that people", "05:49", "seem to be upset about they seem to be", "05:50", "upset about very specific", "05:52", "cases where people showed", "05:55", "um like if if people were right-wing", "05:58", "and they were posting things they were", "06:00", "banned whereas people who are left-wing", "06:03", "or maybe uh people of different races", "06:06", "were allowed to post", "06:08", "racist things or more offensive things", "06:11", "and even dox people and didn't suffer", "06:13", "any consequences for it", "06:14", "this is the argument my problem is i", "06:17", "don't spend enough time reading this", "06:19", "stuff i don't know", "06:20", "like this is like when people get banned", "06:23", "like anthony kumi is a friend of mine i", "06:24", "don't really know why he got banned i", "06:26", "don't know what happened", "06:27", "i know there was that incident with that", "06:29", "that woman that punched him", "06:31", "and he wound up getting fired he was", "06:32", "drunk and he said a bunch of really", "06:33", "stupid shit on in", "06:35", "and twitter and then later apologized", "06:37", "for it but", "06:38", "i don't know if that's what got him far", "06:40", "uh kicked off twitter but he's my friend", "06:42", "so what i'm saying is all these other", "06:44", "guys that have problems", "06:46", "i don't know what the fuck happened man", "06:47", "i'm busy i really don't", "06:49", "i don't know i don't even know what got", "06:51", "alex jones kicked off which is why i", "06:53", "asked him because", "06:54", "that was one of the last platforms for", "06:56", "alex jones was twitter but something got", "06:58", "him kicked off", "07:00", "their take on it was it they never", "07:02", "kicked him off before", "07:03", "because he didn't violate their terms of", "07:05", "service", "07:06", "and another thing that's very", "07:07", "encouraging that jack said and i know", "07:09", "it's it's fun to get mad at things it's", "07:11", "fun to get mad at him it's fun to get", "07:13", "mad at me for it i get it i'd probably", "07:14", "do the exact same thing i totally", "07:16", "understand it", "07:17", "but one of the things that he said was", "07:20", "that", "07:21", "he believes that the ability to", "07:24", "communicate on the internet through", "07:25", "twitter or through these", "07:27", "platforms is a basic human right", "07:30", "that's how you look like i said do you", "07:32", "think of it like", "07:33", "uh a network like nbc like if you're on", "07:36", "nbc they can decide what's on and what's", "07:37", "not on", "07:38", "or do you look at it like a utility", "07:41", "and he specifically said that he looked", "07:43", "at it more like that that he thought it", "07:45", "was", "07:45", "a basic right that's very encouraging he", "07:48", "also said that he would bring on", "07:50", "whoever it is in his team that's", "07:52", "responsible for these things", "07:54", "so we could hear from the actual person", "07:58", "who decides who's getting banned and why", "08:00", "they're getting banned and", "08:01", "what what is what's the decision making", "08:03", "behind all these things", "08:04", "we can go over all of them", "08:07", "i didn't think the podcast would", "08:10", "create such a controversy but that's", "08:13", "probably", "08:14", "poor prior planning on my part because", "08:17", "my thought about it was hey", "08:18", "i want to like it's fucking crazy to be", "08:21", "running twitter", "08:22", "like it's crazy that this thing exists", "08:24", "the president uses it as a platform i", "08:25", "want to talk", "08:26", "about the dude who created this and what", "08:28", "is this like", "08:29", "to have this thing evolved to become", "08:30", "what it's become because it didn't start", "08:32", "out that way it started out like fun", "08:34", "shit like", "08:35", "uh at bryan red bands going to the", "08:37", "movies you know what i mean like that's", "08:38", "what people used it for", "08:40", "and then along the way it became this", "08:42", "global", "08:43", "method of distributing information where", "08:45", "people use it in war zones man", "08:46", "they use it to to tell people where", "08:48", "attacks are they use it for all kinds of", "08:50", "crazy shit it's like it's a", "08:51", "really powerful but strange medium", "08:55", "i didn't think about getting into the", "08:58", "weeds with all the very specific people", "09:00", "that got banned i just wanted to find", "09:01", "out why they banned people", "09:03", "that was my take on it i know there's a", "09:05", "lot of", "09:06", "conservative voices that have never been", "09:08", "banned i don't think stephen crowder's", "09:10", "been banned", "09:11", "i don't think cernovich has been banned", "09:12", "has he been banned there's", "09:15", "a bunch that have not been banned right", "09:18", "so it's not like they banned all", "09:19", "right-wing voices so what is it", "09:21", "i don't know what it is i think it's", "09:22", "what he said people reporting", "09:24", "the tweet and then somebody's looking at", "09:27", "it going well this does violate", "09:29", "our you know policy and maybe you know", "09:31", "all these people that", "09:33", "that got banned violated the policy", "09:35", "somehow you know", "09:36", "it's probably as simple and cut clean as", "09:38", "that you know it's it's not that simple", "09:40", "right because they make their own", "09:41", "policies", "09:43", "and it's also not that simple if people", "09:45", "are allowed to say", "09:46", "similar things that are very racist in", "09:50", "vast generalizations about white people", "09:53", "which seems to have been the case in at", "09:55", "least a few instances", "09:57", "where people reported that people", "10:00", "said fucked up things about white people", "10:02", "but there was no repercussions", "10:05", "and you know that's where the argument", "10:08", "becomes these people are more oppressed", "10:12", "and so the white people are thought of", "10:14", "as the oppressor", "10:15", "so you have this white privilege thing", "10:18", "that people like to use now as a reason", "10:20", "to", "10:21", "to decide to like silence someone like", "10:23", "check your white privilege that's a", "10:24", "that's an interesting thing that's", "10:25", "happening so if", "10:27", "if there's this genuine movement where", "10:29", "people think that it's okay", "10:31", "to say things about one race", "10:34", "whether you like it or not that's racism", "10:37", "and if you're allowing that from any one", "10:40", "side and not allowing it from another",

almost", "10:51", "everybody who's not a racist right", "10:52", "because of the history of this country", "10:54", "because of slavery because of all these", "10:55", "things it's a different

the really weird thing that people", "11:23", "are throwing around these days", "11:24", "is that you can't be racist against", "11:27", "white people because", "11:28", "racism is about power and influence", "11:32", "it's about using your your in the that", "11:34", "black people are not powerful the white", "11:36", "people are powerful from the white", "11:37", "people the ones who are oppressed", "11:38", "so it's impossible to be racist against", "11:40", "them", "11:41", "that sounds like horseshit to me i'm not", "11:43", "buying that that doesn't make any sense", "11:45",
