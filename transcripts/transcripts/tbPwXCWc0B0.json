at least six months to like start", "11:29", "walking and it ended up taking much", "11:32", "longer than that because so about four", "11:35", "or five months in I got on the road and", "11:36", "then and then a a doctor thought that", "11:42", "maybe I was getting a like just a", "11:43", "topical infection and gave me some stuff", "11:47", "that wasn't good enough for the", "11:48", "infection and then I started so about", "11:52", "four or five months later I started", "11:54", "having fevers and then I went into the", "11:56", "hospital and then they're like you have", "11:58",

it", "12:27", "but it was still certainly it was not", "12:29", "perfect at all they wouldn't let me do", "12:32", "stuff out of state I had to get myself", "12:33", "back to California and and do you mean", "12:37", "buy stuff out of state you mean surgical", "12:38", "surgery and Hospital checkups I had to", "12:41", "pay they had them in California because", "12:43", "your insurance yeah and so when I was in", "12:45", "Wisconsin I had to pay out-of-pocket for", "12:47", "that and and it's like kind of not", "12:50", "supposed to be that way either but there", "12:52", "was the I mean I would I would call and", "12:55", "try to in the insurance company and be", "12:57", "like you need this one form okay I call", "12:59", "this company and they'd be like yeah", "13:00", "only doctors can get that form and so", "13:02", "I'd tell my doctor and he'd be like no", "13:04", "you can get that you have to go here and", "13:06", "then it was like around and around", "13:07", "sometimes

size like you know get", "13:17", "medical bills up pipe we're piling up", "13:19", "and so the second surgery what they did", "13:22", "was they just cut out they took out the", "13:24", "hardware that's what that's what got", "13:26", "infected and then they kind of where the", "13:29", "holes were from the screws they kind of", "13:32", "drilled those out a little bit and then", "13:34", "they just cut off the cut as big of a", "13:37", "hole as they possibly could in my foot", "13:39", "to suck out as much of the infection as", "13:41", "possible and so I thought I was going to", "13:44", "be in a hospital for and I still hadn't", "13:46", "walked at this point and then I thought", "13:47", "I was going to be there like you'll be", "13:49", "in a hospital for like a week and a half", "13:51", "or so two weeks and I was like okay fine", "13:54", "I like I'm in I finally someone's going", "13:57", "to be like taking care of me we're just", "13:59", "going to get this done

was just a year of dealing", "15:09", "with this so because of the fact that", "15:11", "this was so expensive they just decided", "15:13", "to say fuck this guy let's make him do", "15:15", "all the medical stuff himself yeah they", "15:17", "were like you ever heard of that before", "15:18", "they're like well he's a young guy he", "15:20", "seems like he's in good spirits and", "15:22",

pulling out this gauze I didn't", "16:05", "know how big the hole was at first but", "16:07", "then it was like one of those magic", "16:09", "scarves I'm coming yeah and and then", "16:14", "they're like so you're gonna need to", "16:15", "take this out and then look in here look", "16:17", "in your hole you're going to need to", "16:19", "clean it out and like clean off your", "16:21", "bone and
