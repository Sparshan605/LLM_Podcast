that", "02:45", "goes in with a more violent style which", "02:48", "I've done many times in my life I think", "02:50", "that's a bit more complicated because", "02:53", "there's a lot more timing in

"notice and beat him so he wanted", "27:43", "Redemption for that yeah there was that", "27:47", "fight was in it you one of the things", "27:49", "about like watching you fight as someone", "27:51", "who's seen a lot of people fight there's", "27:53", "there's moments in exchanges where after", "27:56", "the exchange a guy will try to take a", "27:58", "break or a girl try to catch his breath", "28:00", "or move pace negatory break yeah there's", "28:04", "little breaks and then there's guys who", "28:06", "recognize those breaks and push in", "28:08", "you're a guy who pushes in

things very", "28:17", "intense ya know that's the thing about", "28:19", "all your fights they're very intense you", "28:22", "know there's a there's a certain level", "28:23", "of violence that you bring into the", "28:25", "Octagon that someone has to be prepared", "28:27", "for you know and there's some guys that", "28:29", "are prepared for it and makes for", "28:31", "amazing fights like

"can't keep that then keeping you off of", "28:41", "them yeah and I think what my goal as a", "28:46", "martial artist as a fighter a marshal", "28:49", "you know whatever you would call combat", "28:51", "guy you know I'd get my skills up to the", "28:55", "point where is your mind where it", "28:57", "matches the mind yeah crazy yeah I mean", "29:00", "a lot of guys struggle the other way", "29:02", "yeah and I think one of the the things", "29:05", "that I talk about a lot that you see I", "29:08", "don't think that I was necessarily born", "29:10", "this way this is where I think a lot of", "29:12", "people get confused I mean I was", "29:16", "certainly born with an inclination", "29:17", "towards fighting I wouldn't be where I'm", "29:21", "at without that but you know I work a", "29:26", "lot on my mind I do a lot of stuff I've", "29:31", "always been obsessed with martial arts", "29:33", "and in combat as a whole and I hear", "29:37", "other people say they're obsessed like", "29:39", "Conor even made it really famous when he", "29:40", "started saying it right I think my", "29:42", "obsession goes far far beyond what", "29:44", "anybody's even even close to I don't", "29:46", "think they're their definition of", "29:49", "obsession even even its comparable to", "29:53", "mine at all I mean I'm far more obsessed", "29:55", "I've read probably I got a library of", "29:57", "sports psychology books of strength", "29:59", "conditioning books of martial arts books", "30:02", "all this stuff I mean it's literally on", "30:05", "my mind 25 say but one of the things I", "30:06", "really focus on is the the sports", "30:08", "psychology part and I think that is why", "30:12", "it's expressed that way in the fight and", "30:16", "you hear a lot of people they'll say you", "30:18", "have you heard like men you know my mind", "30:20", "is already strong like I ain't scared", "30:22", "when I walk in there or stupid shit like", "30:24", "that and

so and I think the mind is", "30:43", "one of those things that can always be", "30:47", "better like we're not tapping into I", "30:49", "mean what are we timing like 10% of our", "30:50", "brains", "30:51", "it's all best yeah that's yeah that's", "30:53", "bullshit you know they used to think", "30:54", "that these to think that that's", "30:57", "something they say but the reality is", "31:00", "your brain has a bunch of different", "31:02", "quadrants for all sorts of different", "31:03", "functions okay so when you know you're", "31:06", "utilizing a certain portion of your", "31:07", "brain that's the portion your brain", "31:09", "that's responsible for those actions", "31:11", "okay yeah it's not either way our minds", "31:14", "are certainly far more unlimited and far", "31:17", "more potential than we're tapping into I", "31:18", "think your mind is a lot like your body", "31:20", "and it performs and it does what you", "31:23", "asked of it and if you just are a lazy", "31:26", "bitch it doesn't do anything but sit", "31:27", "around and watch TV and you don't ever", "31:29", "challenge your mind I think your mind is", "31:31", "weak in an atrophies

you know how that goes yeah", "31:54", "yeah it's very but at the same time I", "31:58", "try to use everything as an opportunity", "32:00", "to practice on my mind to write how you", "32:05", "do anything is how you do everything", "32:06", "right right and so I think you know we", "32:10", "can use opportunities all the time", "32:11", "and but yes I do meditate I do tons of", "32:16", "visualization I have my stratification", "32:20", "coach I work with now he's he's also got", "32:22", "a degree in sports psychology so we", "32:23", "integrate a lot of that in the training",

think he's the greatest", "44:06", "ever performance-wise we were talking", "44:08", "about performance wise earlier before", "44:10", "the podcast started in verses like we're", "44:11", "talking about Cain Velasquez performance", "44:13", "wise like the actual results versus what", "44:18", "you think about their ability you know I", "44:20", "think Ken when he was at the time I", "44:22", "never saw anybody like Cain when he was", "44:24", "in his prime 240 pounds unfuckin godly", "44:27", "cardio we just never stopped coming at", "44:29", "you technique", "44:32", "take it remember my thing my whole thing", "44:34", "with it though is as soon as you test", "44:37", "positive once I take you out of the", "44:39", "greatest pure it's just against the", "44:41", "rules I'm not even against steroids like", "44:43", "take steroids you know like if it's your", "44:45", "endocrinologist tells you to take", "44:46", "steroids go fucking do it good good for", "44:49", "you but in our sport unfortunately it's", "44:51", "against the rules so there's only a", "44:52", "certain amount of people doing it so if", "44:55", "you're doing it you're cheating right", "44:57", "and but do you think John was taking", "44:59", "steroids I don't know I don't but it you", "45:00", "I don't think he was but to be honest it", "45:03", "doesn't matter to me I mean you know", "45:05", "I've said this for a long time I think", "45:07", "it should be a lifetime ban first", "45:08", "offense we hear it yeah and there's", "45:11", "gonna be martyrs there would be guys", "45:13", "like I don't think Tim means was taking", "45:14", "steroids that he wasn't he certainly did", "45:16", "not look like it he wasn't that far okay", "45:20", "so found the supplement that he was", "45:21", "taken there was a totally legal", "45:23", "supplement guy you get a bunch of shit", "45:25", "so views but companies are these", "45:27", "companies rather they get it from China", "45:28", "and they they have these bins and like", "45:32", "we had a problem with that with the", "45:33", "alpha brain when we first thought not", "45:34", "steroids but vitamins that were in alpha", "45:37", "brain that weren't suppose that were", "45:38", "supposed to be there we have all our", "45:39", "stuff independently tested and when we", "45:42", "had it independently tested it turned", "45:43", "out that the mixers that when they were", "45:45", "putting all the different ingredients in", "45:47", "they would be putting in these vats and", "45:49", "they'd use these vats for other shit and", "45:51", "how to completely cleaned it out and", "45:52", "this is a problem with companies that", "45:54", "sell steroids and also sell things like", "45:57", "creatine like this is the this is the", "45:59", "big story about Jon Jones this is the", "46:02", "big rumor this is what they're worth", "46:03", "they think is that he was doing coke", "46:05", "that had creatine in and yeah it was cut", "46:08", "with creatine that creatine probably had", "46:10", "trace elements of steroids the reason", "46:11", "why that makes sense is because he", "46:13", "tested negative", "46:14", "right before that test and then tested", "46:17", "positive and then tested negative again", "46:19", "a short time after that this is a", "46:21", "steroid that takes several months to get", "46:23", "out of your system but it got out of his", "46:25", "system very quickly which would indicate", "46:27", "it was a very very small trace amount", "46:30", "not an amount that you would take if you", "46:32", "were actually using it to try to you", "46:34", "know to get a performance enhancing", "46:36", "benefit that's what I think it makes", "46:39", "sense to me and so it makes it it's key", "46:41", "to it's fair enough and I'm certainly", "46:44", "there's cases so under in my world where", "46:48", "okay first offense lifetime ban I think", "46:52", "a lot of guys would be a lot more", "46:53", "careful with things I kept for one and I", "46:55", "think you know there would be a due", "46:57", "process so you know say he proved that", "46:59", "or like ten means you know proved it you", "47:01", "know he comes right back right and I", "47:05", "also think unfortunately there would be", "47:07", "people that would probably you have no", "47:11", "bad intention and would have the you", "47:13", "know end up testing positive and having", "47:16", "a lifetime ban and there would be", "47:18", "martyrs basically I can't I can't sign", "47:21", "off on martyrs man too many dudes have", "47:22", "dreams you know sure what about you like", "47:25", "what if you accidentally took some", "47:26", "creatine and some bullshit personally", "47:28", "I'm extremely diligent I do my you

I know", "47:40", "that it's good stuff and that's my", "47:42", "primary supplement source", "47:44", "I mean I'm I don't go do coke if you", "47:48", "tell me like alright if you do those", "47:50", "things and something bad happens to you", "47:53", "that's your fault", "47:53", "you know I mean if if for instance he", "47:56", "was doing coke and he you know not knock", "47:58", "on john jones either i mean it's it's a", "48:00", "i'm not living his life i mean he's in a", "48:03", "difficult situation as a young kid you", "48:06", "know with god I mean I can only imagine", "48:10", "the amount of people approaching him for", "48:11", "crazy things and trying to talk him into", "48:14", "all this so I have some sympathy for his", "48:16", "situation but you know you make their", "48:18", "choice you have to pay the consequences", "48:20", "for the choice I agreed that you should", "48:22", "pay the consequences for the choice I", "48:25", "just don't agree that the price should", "48:26", "be so high you know like what", "48:29", "when you think about a guy like Anderson", "48:30", "Silva like Anderson Silva just tested", "48:32", "positive again again do you think that", "48:33", "that takes him out of the consideration", "48:35", "for the greatest of all time in my mind", "48:37", "a hundred percent see I do want it", "48:39", "because he's old forty so we again we", "48:44", "can feel whatever we want to feel right", "48:45", "I mean I feel like he probably wasn't", "48:47", "doing it the whole time but he might", "48:49", "have been yeah but do I know

about", "50:55", "Hendricks like how much of it was", "50:56", "burnout how much of it was possibly he", "50:59", "was taking something you got to say it", "51:01", "possibly because never tested positive", "51:02", "for anything but yeah but dude he was", "51:05", "launching people across you know I was", "51:08", "the last fight before you saw her when I", "51:10", "fought him you know I

"different compared to now yes look the", "51:22", "same yeah he doesn't fight the same it's", "51:24", "like a certainly part of that has to be", "51:26", "motivation too I mean he's just there's", "51:27", "no way he's under the same mental", "51:32", "aspiration that he had before he's just", "51:34", "so looks at it differently could be also", "51:36", "because his hormones are all fucked

you know", "106:07", "regular keto salt supplements mm-hmm but", "106:10", "that one you know for performance", "106:12", "actually brings my performance up higher", "106:14", "then then I would usually go take that", "106:16", "ketone Esther before you train yeah so", "106:19", "how long before you train so I take it", "106:20", "with some glucose usually about 20", "106:23", "minutes before

"106:47", "millimole range right now but yeah so", "106:51", "you know I do that and then but now I've", "106:52", "adjusted it where I'm not as concerned", "106:54", "with staying in ketosis because the main", "106:56", "concern with that is I want to get the", "106:58", "benefits for the brain and you know the", "107:01", "TBI and things like that now it's a when", "107:05", "I get closer to a

that that are a lot", "107:45", "of people kind of promulgate is that our", "107:47", "sport is very anaerobic and it's really", "107:49", "not it's a lot more aerobic and your", "107:51", "aerobic capacity will go up on keto your", "107:53", "robic your my ability to recover", "107:55", "specifically without even with no carbs", "107:58", "my blood glucose could be a 70s and 80s", "108:00",

"108:19", "kick in that mass capacity and aerobic", "108:23", "part of things that's where you know", "108:25", "things suffer a little suffer yeah and", "108:28", "that's where you have to add in the", "108:29", "carbs and and but again you know the the", "108:32", "amount of training that I do I mean I", "108:33", "can add in a lot of carbs and I can", "108:35", "still get away with it and say and I can", "108:36", "even stay in ketosis if if I want to but", "108:39", "I think a lot of people will make the", "108:40", "mistake that I made originally again is", "108:43", "my own guinea pig and and I really", "108:44", "focused on the blood ketone levels", "108:47", "rather than the performance and I wanted", "108:51", "to be able to perform with high", "108:53", "ketogenic levels or you know high ketone", "108:55", "levels in my blood and it's not really", "108:59", "necessary right like this should be", "109:00", "solely performance based yeah but it did", "109:03", "it did help me cut weight though I", "109:04", "thought it was fascinating with been", "109:05", "Greenfeld was saying we were talking", "109:07", "about it before the podcast about how he", "109:08", "would carb up and then take ketone", "109:10", "supplements so he had the benefit of", "109:12", "having a lot of carbohydrates in his", "109:14", "system but also having a lot of ketones", "109:16", "in his system and he said he felt like a", "109:18", "fucking animal", "109:19", "yeah and that's yeah pretty similar to", "109:21", "by how we feel right now and that's", "109:23", "totally doable yeah yeah I mean that's", "109:25", "not and I tell you like when I take it", "109:27", "it does amazing things for me men I've", "109:32", "saw I've heard stories of people when", "109:35", "they take this ester that they'll pull", "109:36", "out moves like they haven't done in ten", "109:38", "years", "109:38", "like they recalls these moves I've done", "109:41", "things where I when I do it I feel like", "109:43", "I'm five six years younger", "109:46", "I mean it's done some fascinating things", "109:48", "just taking that drink just taking the", "109:49", "ester with some some get diggin out of", "109:56", "trash pulling it out here yeah ketone", "109:57", "aid yeah ketone aid ketone ester yeah it", "110:00", "looks like you're a scientist like this", "110:02", "bad type shit okay the thing with it", "110:06", "it's extremely expensive and they're", "110:08", "working on getting the it's it's like", "110:11", "burnt rubber they're working on getting", "110:12", "the not other cost down are they staying", "110:16", "and how much of these things I'm not", "110:18", "sure but I think it's like $30 a gram", "110:20", "and that's like 40 grams I think that's", "110:22", "incredible I could be off on that I'm", "110:24", "not sure but that's quite pricey I I", "110:26", "heard that the UK cycling team used it", "110:30", "they paid like $6,000 for you know", "110:35", "however much just a small amount and", "110:37", "they used it for the when they won the", "110:39", "Tour de France actually that's what I", "110:41", "heard", "110:41", "I don't not sure it is but I believe it", "110:43", "I mean this shit does amazing things for", "110:45", "you but yeah so the the keto I mean", "110:49", "again it can be used if used properly I", "110:52", "think he can do a lot of benefits I", "110:53", "would recommend to all combat athletes", "110:58", "NFL players over you know they've taken", "111:01", "concussions taking hits to the brain or", "111:03", "that are over a certain age where your", "111:06", "metabolism changes I mean that's where", "111:07", "my biggest benefit was and even a TJ was", "111:10", "talking - hey TJ Dillashaw I was talking", "111:11", "with him about his coach I had him", "111:13", "switch over because he was burning", "111:14", "primarily carbohydrates especially now", "111:17", "TJ's gonna try to make 125 yeah and I", "111:20", "don't know if he was talking to me about", "111:23", "long before that was ever talked about", "111:25", "so mm-hmm but you know he did some tests", "111:28", "on him and found that he's burning all", "111:30", "carbohydrate all the time which can be", "111:31", "an issue", "111:32", "yeah in long training sessions", "111:33", "specifically so he switched it up a bit", "111:36", "yeah and I don't think he's going full", "111:38", "keto but I think he's doing something", "111:39", "similar to like what I'm doing where the", "111:41", "he's doing keto with you know some", "111:43", "carbohydrates still and he's using the", "111:45", "so basically like the only carbohydrates", "111:47", "that we need as an athlete is for the", "111:49", "workout right we don't need them after", "111:50", "that you know maybe for recovery which", "111:53", "is again I think it's debatable but you", "111:56", "know carbohydrate is not a necessary", "111:58", "substance even live you know you could", "112:00", "live your entire life without you know", "112:02", "carbohydrate and be perfectly fine yeah", "112:04", "there's a lot of guys that are doing", "112:06", "this carnivore diet now I've heard of", "112:08", "this yeah Marc Bell told me he's never", "112:10", "felt better he's doing that shit now", "112:12", "yeah yeah he's not a steak this is de", "112:17", "called a no sausage or bacon", "112:19", "he's bacon too but it's mostly meat he's", "112:21", "eaten mostly meat mostly me so with no", "112:24", "vegetables a little bit every now and", "112:26", "then but most of what he's eating is", "112:27", "just meats yeah I feel completely", "112:30", "different when I load up my vegetables", "112:31", "even a day or two I mean I don't know do", "112:34", "you feel this and I feel better yeah I'm", "112:37", "a big family thing I just I love", "112:39", "drinking it too", "112:40", "you know I loved getting like real rich", "112:42", "green leafy vegetable juice mmm and

these classes you know where", "114:44", "you go out and live off the land and", "114:46", "things like that right and you know he", "114:49", "gets it from like Maine or Canada and", "114:51", "it's like this fungus that grows on", "114:53", "trees and it's really really hard and", "114:55", "they chop it off and then you can you", "114:57", "grind it up put it in the tea or", "114:58",

sick for", "115:22", "like two weeks but you know you had a", "115:25", "pretty significant back injury at one", "115:27", "point I heard a desk yeah how did you", "115:29", "fix that I guess it's never really fixed", "115:32", "fixed right I got a epidural steroid", "115:36", "injection first because I wanted to make", "115:38", "the fighters what I'm supposed to fight", "115:39", "con it the first time it's like two", "115:40", "weeks out of the fight and does it", "115:42", "what is epidural steroid does it relax", "115:44", "the area and loosen the inflammation a", "115:47", "corticosteroid right yes so it gets rid", "115:50", "of inflammation it took mine we did it", "115:53", "on a Friday this was like two weeks out", "115:55", "of the fight so what had happened is", "115:58", "about four weeks out of the fight is", "116:00", "when I originally heard it and you know", "116:02", "I'm Michael fucking suck it up and do I", "116:04", "think you said you herniated disc so you", "116:05", "know it feels like right now yeah I'm", "116:07", "gonna suck this shit up and I'm gonna", "116:08", "get through it and you know I couldn't", "116:10", "do anything you barely even had pads", "116:12", "right", "116:13", "well I eventually ended up you know", "116:16", "going to a well actually so this is part", "116:19", "of my problem with chiropractors right", "116:20", "so I went to a chiropractor first and", "116:22", "he's like oh yeah you know", "116:24", "and is all you know all this kind of", "116:26", "garbage anyway I was seeing a pain", "116:30", "specialist and he knew what it was", "116:32", "within 30 seconds yeah anyway so I got", "116:34", "that bad oral steroid and it didn't work", "116:36", "right away so I had to give a second one", "116:38", "later", "116:39", "so yeah the second time that's the issue", "116:44", "right is it masks the issue yes I think", "116:46", "it reduces some of the information so", "116:48", "some of the problems of it yeah so", "116:50", "that's it I mean hidden he told me that", "116:52", "he said you know look we're gonna get", "116:53", "you to the fight this is the best way to", "116:56", "get you to the fight right but it didn't", "116:58", "work well enough the first time so I end", "116:59", "up getting a second one and it worked", "117:01", "very well the second time but then of", "117:03", "course as you know having a herniated", "117:06", "disc it just took years to correct it", "117:09", "you know and I mean I work on all the", "117:12", "time now if I if I don't keep on it then", "117:15", "I will feel the effect out feel the", "117:19", "issues right yeah especially in jujitsu", "117:21", "right as a worse time your lower back", "117:24", "yeah yes l5 out there did you use Lewis", "117:28", "Simmons reverse hyper to use that", "117:30", "machine that effort yeah yeah of course", "117:31", "I do", "117:32", "tons of the reverse hyper all the time I", "117:35", "mean I have a whole routine that I do", "117:37", "pretty much after pretty much every", "117:39", "workout just to strengthen you back yep", "117:41", "far back and hips a lot of my personal", "117:46",

"the truth that's intense", "158:03", "yeah I think it's gonna be the future", "158:05", "and I think when that happens people are", "158:08", "just not gonna accept all the shit that", "158:10", "we've accepted for so many years they", "158:12", "could be an app on the phone I think", "158:15", "it's probably gonna be something that", "158:16", "you wear in your body", "158:17", "I think we're real close to that I think", "158:19", "we're real close to embedded chips that", "158:21", "you wear in your body and I think those", "158:23", "chips are probably going to interface", "158:24", "wirelessly and you're just gonna be able", "158:26", "to read thoughts and ideas that come", "158:29", "from people that are gonna come and", "158:30", "probably a new language I think we're", "158:32", "gonna be able to develop a universal", "158:34", "language I don't a lot of religious", "158:37", "people say that's the mark of the beast", "158:38", "right", "158:39", "oh that's it's no like a birthmark or", "158:43", "some gently what are the religious", "158:44", "people thing like a chip I was raised in", "158:47", "an ultra religious thing environment", "158:50", "right my mom was it was extremely", "158:52", "religious and I'm talking tongues they", "158:54", "probably thought that no no they you", "158:58", "know they're very fundamental you know", "159:01", "my brother could go away deeper into", "159:05", "what they were about I never even paid", "159:06", "attention but but I remember them", "159:08", "talking about like the mark of the beast", "159:11", "and they're like it's going to be", "159:12", "something implanted in you and you know", "159:14", "if you take it then you're going to hell", "159:16", "and if you don't take it you know or", "159:19", "something like that and maybe there's", "159:20", "planning ahead they want to keep lying", "159:22", "you gotta keep that plan ahead these", "159:24", "chips are certainly lying to me but I", "159:27", "think there's gonna be a language a", "159:29", "universal language they figure out how", "159:30", "to teach the children that's starting", "159:32", "with children because children learn", "159:34", "languages very easily and if they", "159:36", "develop a universal language that is", "159:38", "somehow or another either translated", "159:41", "through computers because you know they", "159:43", "have a thing now these Google earbuds", "159:45", "that you use with a pixel two phones so", "159:48", "if you were talking to me in Spanish I", "159:49", "would hear the translation what you said", "159:51", "in English in my ears that's fucking", "159:53", "amazing when I saw that I was like how", "159:55", "is nobody noticing that this is step one", "159:57", "this is step one of a universal language", "159:59", "yeah the translation like to English is", "160:02", "fascinating but I think ultimately we're", "160:05", "going to be able to figure out how to", "160:07", "communicate with", "160:08", "everybody with a new language and this", "160:11", "new this is this not hard to do I mean", "160:13", "it's obviously not easy but it's not", "160:15", "impossible to develop a new language", "160:17", "like a universal language that's", "160:19", "accepted by everybody yeah yeah I used", "160:22", "to I have a Brazilian friend that comes", "160:24", "up to my house sometimes and we put the", "160:27", "Google Translate thing just right in", "160:30", "between us mm-hmm and you can talk and", "160:32", "it detects which language and it says it", "160:35",

"160:42", "loud yeah that's amazing not I mean it's", "160:45", "not 100 percent accurate sometimes yet", "160:47", "so I I think this is one step and then I", "160:49", "think the next step is going to be some", "160:52", "sort of a way to detect whether or not", "160:53", "our people are lying and then another", "160:55", "step is going to be more enhanced", "160:57", "communication then another step after", "160:59", "that is going to be some sort of", "161:00", "telekinetic or tell is some sort of", "161:04", "communication without verbalizing", "161:06", "without words fuck that's that's coming", "161:09", "I'll just be out in the woods yeah y'all", "161:12", "do your thing I'm gonna hang out out", "161:14", "here it might be the best way to live I", "161:15", "mean that's how I want
