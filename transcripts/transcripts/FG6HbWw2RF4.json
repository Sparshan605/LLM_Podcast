was what's happening with Peter", "00:27", "Bogosian at Portland State University", "00:29", "yeah for folks who don't know the story", "00:30", "he and I forget his two colleagues", "00:34",

would", "01:07", "love to know your thoughts as a", "01:09", "professor like what oh sure yeah so you", "01:11", "know for those who don't know I guess", "01:13", "most your listeners probably do but you", "01:15", "know it was called the grievance studies", "01:17", "hoax yeah because and and this is one of", "01:20", "the big issues going on in the Academy I", "01:21", "hope I'll talk about is you know what", "01:25", "does it take to have good scholarship", "01:26", "and and the argument is that in some", "01:28", "fields as long as you hate the right", "01:30", "things and use the right

that that's the case and", "01:40", "so they wrote these papers one of them", "01:42", "was actually a section of mine Kumpf yes", "01:45", "and they just substituted in something", "01:47", "about feminism for Nazism something like", "01:49", "that and I don't remember that one", "01:51", "actually got I think it's it at any rate", "01:53", "the point is they were trying to show", "01:55",

"03:08", "support of of billion thank you for", "03:10", "doing that but if you read the you know", "03:13", "they at his university committee was", "03:16", "impaneled and they looked at the literal", "03:18", "definition of data fabrication and it's", "03:20", "possible that he does fall under that", "03:22", "but the point of this whole thing is so", "03:26", "it's not like I can't weigh in on", "03:27", "whether or not technically but but these", "03:32", "rules are put in place to prevent the", "03:35", "corruption of the scientific record and", "03:37", "what he was doing was

a fraud it was an expose", "04:03", "that's right yeah and I hope that they", "04:06", "come to their senses and they do have a", "04:08", "point if I'm going to be completely", "04:10", "objective

you", "06:25", "put us together we cancel out each", "06:27", "other's confirmation biases so the", "06:29", "truth-seeking game is a very special", "06:31", "game that can only be played in a very",

"06:42", "Pennsylvania and then just in the last", "06:44", "few years it's like some people are", "06:46", "playing this really different game and", "06:48", "it's like if you know if I'm playing", "06:49", "tennis and I hit the ball to you like", "06:51", "we're in a seminar class mm-hmm I give", "06:53", "you a question I challenge you you come", "06:55", "back and we go back and forth and in the", "06:57", "process we learned so that's like kind", "07:00", "of like playing tennis so I'm doing this", "07:02", "and then suddenly like someone tackles", "07:04", "me like what that you don't do that in", "07:06", "tennis no no but they're playing", "07:08", "football you see and in football it's a", "07:10", "much rougher game and you're trying to", "07:12", "destroy the others I'm not really in", "07:13", "football but I'm saying yes you know", "07:14", "it's a and so as norms of combat come in", "07:18", "and what I mean by it is political", "07:20", "combat as some people within", "07:23", "universities see that what we're doing", "07:25", "here is not seeking truth we're trying", "07:28", "to fight fascism or we're trying to", "07:30", "defeat conservatism or we're trying to", "07:31", "fight racism or whatever some sort of", "07:34", "political goal and these games are", "07:36", "completely incompatible and so that's", "07:38", "why this madness has erupted where you", "07:40", "see professors saying something maybe", "07:43", "it's a little provocative I'm going back", "07:45", "to Socrates that was kind of the point", "07:46", "was to provoke and you see these bizarre", "07:49", "reactions emotional reactions groups", "07:53", "organized to demand that a professor be", "07:56", "fired because we're playing different", "07:57", "games yeah how did this start", "08:00", "how did it start because it seems like", "08:03", "there there has to be an event or", "08:05", "something or yeah a trend well so so the", "08:09", "you know the book that the book that I", "08:11", "just put out in September with Greg", "08:13", "Luciana off the coddling of the American", "08:15", "mind yeah I read the first chapter that", "08:18", "as well okay well thank you for", "08:19", "admitting that it was only one chapter", "08:21", "usually driven to that one because the", "08:24", "unfortunately I was reading that and", "08:27", "then I got on a flight and I just wanted", "08:29", "to zone out so I listened to this one on", "08:31", "tape", "08:31", "okay well I'll tell you all about it but", "08:33", "the key thing is that that book that", "08:36", "calling the American mind was something", "08:37", "that we wrote because Greg began", "08:39", "observing this weird stuff happening on", "08:41", "universities in 2014 it all starts in", "08:43", "2014 most of your listeners have heard", "08:46", "about safe spaces microaggressions bias", "08:49", "response teams trigger warnings all that", "08:51", "stuff", "08:52", "that stuff didn't exist before 2014 it", "08:55", "just begins creeping in then and then it", "08:56", "kind of blows up in 2015 and so our", "08:59", "whole book is an exploration of why why", "09:01", "did this happen and so to your question", "09:03", "about was there an event our answer is", "09:06", "there are six different causal threads", "09:09", "there's like all these social trends I'm", "09:11", "going back to the 80s and 90s that came", "09:13", "together around 2014 so that students", "09:17", "are a little different and then there", "09:19", "are certain forces acting on them that", "09:21", "are different and so you get this weird", "09:23", "new game you get this explosive mix you", "09:25", "get some students who are actually very", "09:27", "drawn to grievin studies and so very", "09:33", "briefly like the it's things like rising", "09:36", "political polarization so left and right", "09:38", "never particularly liked each other but", "09:40", "in the 70s and 80s if you look at", "09:42", "surveys done of how much you hate people", "09:44", "on the other side it's not that intense", "09:45", "it begins going up in the in the 80s and", "09:49", "then especially after 2000 it's going up", "09:51", "very steeply at the same time university", "09:55", "faculty who have always leaned left", "09:57", "throughout the 20th century but was only", "10:00", "a lean and in the 90s it begins shifting", "10:02", "much further left so that now Faculty's", "10:05", "especially in the social sciences and", "10:06", "Humanities are pretty purified they're", "10:08", "overwhelmingly on the left so you have a", "10:10", "more left-leaning university at a time", "10:14", "when left-right hostility is getting", "10:16", "more and more intense and so any", "10:18", "question that has a political valence", "10:19", "now there's a lot more people who want", "10:21", "to do the football game not the", "10:23", "truth-seeking game and then we got to", "10:24", "defeat the other side don't give me", "10:26", "nuance don't give me data we know what", "10:28", "we believe and damn it we're gonna you", "10:30", "know so you got this changing political", "10:33", "situation and then you've got a couple", "10:35", "of threads about what we've done to kids", "10:37", "so and they've got this is a whole", "10:40", "nother area conversation for us but we", "10:42", "basically took away free play and gave", "10:44", "them social media the same basically", "10:46", "kids were born in 1995 and after Gen Z", "10:50", "they had really different childhoods and", "10:52", "they're not as prepared for conflict and", "10:55", "college we'll get into that later but", "10:58", "you put all these things together you", "10:59", "get kids who are much more anxious and", "11:02", "fragile much more depressed coming onto", "11:04", "campus at a time a much gray", "11:06", "political activism and now these grievin", "11:08", "studies ideas about America's a matrix", "11:10", "of oppression and look at the world in", "11:13", "terms of good versus evil it's more", "11:14", "appealing to them and it's that minority", "11:16", "of students they're the ones who are", "11:19", "initiating a lot of the movements it's", "11:21", "such a strange time to be on the outside", "11:23", "and watch this because a person like", "11:26", "myself is always counted on", "11:27", "intellectuals and professors and people", "11:29", "like yourself to sort of make sense of", "11:32", "things and to reinforce the idea that", "11:37", "freedom of speech and freedom to", "11:40", "knowledge and one of the things that's", "11:43", "most disturbing when you see in schools", "11:45", "is people that are even marginally", "11:49", "right-leaning or centrist being called", "11:52", "Nazis and being silenced and they're", "11:54", "pulling fire alarms when they're", "11:56", "speaking even people like christina hoff", "11:58", "sommers who's a feminist gets shouted", "12:00", "down and people yelling at her in car in", "12:02", "are fascism it's just very strange it's", "12:05", "very strange to watch from the outside", "12:06", "and it's also very strange to not see", "12:08", "any pushback by the professors so", "12:10", "sitting here and seeing this happen and", "12:12", "thinking with these poor kids they're", "12:14", "they're gonna have to go into the", "12:15", "workplace they're gonna have to right", "12:18", "now they're in this very insulated", "12:19", "environment they're gonna escape that", "12:21", "environment when they graduate and then", "12:23", "they're either gonna push this ideology", "12:25", "into the workforce which you do see now", "12:27", "that's it especially telling the lab", "12:29", "that yeah that's right no that's right I", "12:31", "know it's strange to look at it from the", "12:33", "outside and believe me it's stranger", "12:35", "from the inside hmm", "12:36", "but one thing I can say that it might be", "12:38", "helpful here is that from the outside", "12:40", "what you see is the news reports and the", "12:43", "news reports are going to be very", "12:45", "selective and so especially what happens", "12:48", "is because you know universities that", "12:50", "have always leaned left and so the right", "12:52", "leaning media have always been", "12:53", "suspicious so the right leaning media", "12:55", "has huge coverage of every little thing", "12:57", "and sometimes it's it's exaggerated", "13:00", "sometimes it's misinterpreted but the", "13:02", "most time there was something there", "13:03", "left-leaning media tends to ignore it", "13:05", "and so I go around the country and you", "13:08", "know people on the right expect that oh", "13:10", "my god it's chaos and mob violence on", "13:12", "campus which isn't true that's an", "13:13", "exaggeration and the left is like", "13:15", "problem what problem there's nothing", "13:16", "changing mmm and so I think the key", "13:19", "thing", "13:19", "keep in mind here is that there's about", "13:21", "4,500 institutions of higher education", "13:23", "in this country most of them are not", "13:25", "selective schools they'll take anyone", "13:27", "who comes and in those schools not much", "13:30", "is happening but if you go to the elite", "13:33", "liberal arts colleges in the North East", "13:35", "and the West Coast then usually", "13:38", "something is happening and so that", "13:40", "heterodox Academy it's a group that I", "13:42", "co-founded of professors that are", "13:43", "pushing back it's bipartisan we have as", "13:45", "many people on the room the left is on", "13:47", "the right we created a map of where all", "13:49", "the shout downs have taken place and", "13:51", "they're all right in the Northeast or", "13:53", "along the Pacific coast like from you", "13:55", "know evergreen you know down to you know", "13:57", "Berkeley and all that and then a couple", "13:58", "in Chicago so from in most of the", "14:01", "country this stuff is not happening most", "14:03", "schools the culture hasn't really", "14:04", "changed much but at the top schools in", "14:06", "general it has so that's one thing to", "14:09", "just keep in mind there is a moral panic", "14:11", "on the right about this which doesn't", "14:13", "mean that there's not something real", "14:14", "there really is a huge problem but it's", "14:17", "not as pervasive as is sometimes made", "14:18", "out to be", "14:19", "so is it akin to looking at violence in", "14:22", "the news media", "14:23", "like you when you read about violence in", "14:26", "terms of robberies and murders in", "14:27", "general you're not going to encounter", "14:29", "much in your life the world is a large", "14:32", "place yeah but we concentrate on these", "14:35", "really bad moments yeah it's a little", "14:37", "bit like that except that you know one", "14:41", "of the reasons that we took child we", "14:42", "took free play away from kids is that we", "14:45", "were afraid that they'd be abducted and", "14:46", "that almost no that was so rare and but", "14:50", "we got a lot of coverage of that in the", "14:51", "80s and 90s and we changed our behavior", "14:53", "because of that and that was a gross", "14:54", "overreaction the situation on campus is", "14:57", "is not like that is it's your odds of", "15:00", "being nailed are much higher than that", "15:01", "and so you know I hear every day or at", "15:04", "least every week I get an email from a", "15:06", "professor who says you know I I used a", "15:09", "metaphor in class and somebody reported", "15:11", "me and like you know you know and so it", "15:13", "once this happens to you you you pull", "15:15", "back you change your teaching style what", "15:17", "we're seeing on campus is a spectacular", "15:18", "collapse of trust between students and", "15:22", "professors and when we don't trust each", "15:24", "other",

it safe and then everybody", "15:36", "suffers is social media partially to", "15:38", "blame because it's huge", "15:39", "yeah social means a huge part of this", "15:41", "problem so in a couple ways so one is", "15:47", "the generational thing that we have kids", "15:50", "born after 1995 got this in middle", "15:53", "school it had a variety of effects on", "15:54", "them so kids coming in are more", "15:57", "conversant with call out culture and", "15:59", "that's a big part of this the other", "16:01", "thing though is that we used to have", "16:04", "what you would call a reasonable person", "16:06", "standard so you know so you know for", "16:09", "professor what's one oh so a professor", "16:11", "just wrote to me recently he said he you", "16:13", "know he got frustrated while trying to", "16:14", "explain something he said shoot me now", "16:17", "and a student was offended by this", "16:19", "because are you making fun of people", "16:20", "committing suicide and okay you know I", "16:22", "had she come to him and said you know", "16:24", "professor I know you didn't mean", "16:25", "anything but that was kind of", "16:27", "insensitive okay that would have been", "16:28", "great like that's the way to handle it", "16:30", "but for this generation raised with", "16:33", "callout culture and social media you", "16:35", "almost never hear of a student coming to",

"29:51", "if you know if Christina Hoff Sommers", "29:52", "comes to campus you know people will die", "29:54", "or they'll be you know people will be", "29:56", "harmed injured and so there's this this", "30:00", "new way of thinking and Greg thinks wow", "30:03", "how are students learning to do this", "30:05", "like are we teaching them on campus to", "30:07", "think in these distorted ways

Moabites killing the Jebusites or", "33:59", "whatever but you know we we live in an", "34:02", "era in which we've discovered that that", "34:05", "the pie can be grown a million fold and", "34:08", "so to teach students to see society as a", "34:12", "zero-sum competition between groups is", "34:15", "primitive and destructive now in your", "34:17", "book you you actually identify the", "34:19", "moment where these micro aggressions", "34:22", "sort of made their appearance and they", "34:24", "were initially a racist thing so yeah so", "34:28", "the idea of a micro aggression it goes", "34:30", "back to I forget the Scots and", "34:33", "african-american sociologists in the 70s", "34:34", "first coined the term but it really", "34:37", "becomes popular in a 2007 article by", "34:40", "Derald wing sue at Teachers College and", "34:43", "so he talks about this concept of", "34:46", "microaggressions and there are two", "34:48", "things that are good about the concert", "34:50", "that are useful and so one is as racism", "34:53", "as explicit racism has clearly gone down", "34:56", "by any measure explicit racism is", "34:58", "plummeted in American across the West", "35:01", "but you know there could still be subtle", "35:04", "or veiled a racist claim so perfect", "35:06", "legitimate how do you define the", "35:07", "difference between explicit racism", "35:09", "well explicit racism is you know calling", "35:11", "someone a racial slur I hate you because", "35:13", "X and they are identified because of", "35:16", "they've been reported as crimes or well", "35:18", "I would just say that if you're a member", "35:22", "of a culture you can tell when someone", "35:25", "is saying something to insult to put", "35:27", "down her to express hostility right and", "35:29", "that's something that judgment we can", "35:30", "make right and as that's become socially", "35:33", "unacceptable in most circles", "35:35", "so explicit racism is way way down right", "35:37", "but how I'm sorry but the my only", "35:40", "question is how are they measuring is", "35:42", "that well how do you measure", "35:44", "microaggression well how do you measure", "35:46", "even explicit racism yeah oh you say", "35:48", "it's down certainly attitude measures so", "35:51", "there are so surveys done in private how", "35:55", "would you feel if if a black family", "35:58", "moved in next door if a Filipino family", "36:00", "moved now so how would you feel if your", "36:01", "child married you know a Jew a Muslim", "36:04", "hmm so explicit surveys show it", "36:07", "certainly I mean if when you do surveys", "36:11", "of people's experience right people of", "36:14", "race of every race when they report how", "36:15", "often this happens to me every year the", "36:17", "numbers are actually fairly low so there", "36:20", "are ways of measuring experiences of", "36:22", "racism right um how accurate these cause", "36:24", "like first of all I used to have a joke", "36:27", "about this but the idea is that the", "36:28", "problem surveys is your only getting", "36:31", "information people from people so stupid", "36:33", "they take surveys who's taking surveys", "36:35", "so some surveys are subject to that but", "36:38", "you know in general if you if you", "36:41", "approach a question from multiple", "36:42", "perspectives and say in one condition", "36:44", "you pay them for an accurate answer or", "36:46", "not when one condition they're anonymous", "36:48", "or they're not so you can get a sense of", "36:50", "how much the answer moves around", "36:52", "depending on external conditions and so", "36:56", "anyway the point I just want to make is", "36:57", "that the acceptability of using the", "37:00", "n-word or other things you know if a", "37:02", "bunch of white people are talking the", "37:04", "acceptability using the n-word I think", "37:05", "has gone way down in general would you", "37:07", "agree with that yes yes and tremendously", "37:10", "I mean III agree with the the sentiment", "37:13", "and I agree with the the trend that", "37:16", "there is absolutely a trend away from", "37:19", "racism but I was just curious says how", "37:21", "they measured it yeah I'm not an expert", "37:23", "in that area so I'm assuming it's survey", "37:25", "is an analysis of discourse it's", "37:27",

"37:37", "board if there was no more sexism there", "37:39", "was no more racism there was no more any", "37:41", "of these things yeah me it would be", "37:43", "wonderful", "37:44", "then we could just start treating pew", "37:47", "Mons as just human", "37:48", "like this is just who you are you're", "37:51", "just a person no one cares that would be", "37:53", "what a wonderful world we would live in", "37:55", "if this was no longer an issue at all", "37:57", "beautifully put how does that get how", "37:59", "does that ever get through so we were", "38:01", "getting there okay that's what the", "38:03", "twenty no I mean that's what the", "38:04", "twentieth century was about so you and I", "38:07", "are shaped by Unruh how old you are I'm", "38:09", "51", "38:09", "okay I'm 55 we were shaped by the late", "38:12", "20th century and the late 20th century", "38:14", "was a time in America in which you know", "38:18", "earlier on there was all kinds of", "38:19", "prejudice I mean when I was so when I", "38:21", "was born just right before you were born", "38:22", "it was legal to say you can't eat here", "38:25", "because you're black and so you know", "38:26", "that change in 1964-65 but it used to be", "38:31", "that we had legal differentiations by", "38:34", "race and then those were knocked down", "38:36", "but we still had social and it used to", "38:38", "be that if you were gay there was", "38:39", "something humiliating it had to be", "38:41", "hidden and you you know I mean so if you", "38:43", "look at where we were in 1960 or 63 when", "38:45", "I was born and then you look at where we", "38:47", "got by 2000 I mean the progress is", "38:50", "fantastic on every front so that's all I", "38:53", "mean when I say we were moving in that", "38:55", "direction and to your point about you", "38:58", "know wouldn't be great if there was none", "38:59", "of this we just treated people like", "39:00", "people okay yeah that was the 20th", "39:03", "century idea is let's let's get past", "39:05", "these tribal identifications and what is", "39:08", "so alarming to me now is that on campus", "39:11", "it began on campus but it's spreading", "39:13", "elsewhere there and against not", "39:14", "everywhere on campus it's mostly in the", "39:16", "grievant Studies departments um they're", "39:19", "teaching students the opposite they're",

"39:29", "you know if they're good or bad this I", "39:31", "think is the opposite of progress well", "39:33", "it's it's also the differences between", "39:35", "us are really fascinating the difference", "39:38", "is between men and women I think are", "39:41", "some of the more interesting", "39:44", "explanations for human behavior and not", "39:49", "meaning that people must be defined by", "39:51", "their gender but defined by their sex", "39:53", "and but it is interesting when you look", "39:56", "at these gigantic groups like why", "39:58", "certain people tend to gravitate towards", "40:01", "certain", "40:02", "patience or certain types of behavior or", "40:03", "certain hobbies it is really fascinating", "40:05", "yeah that's right and if we were playing", "40:07", "the truth-seeking game if all we cared", "40:09", "about is trying to understand things we", "40:11", "would do the research and we'd figure", "40:12", "out what do people like you know and do", "40:15", "left-handers versus right-handers have", "40:17", "different preferences probably not as", "40:18", "far as I know do boys and girls have", "40:20", "different preferences yeah they're", "40:22", "really big do men and women have", "40:24", "different do they enjoy different things", "40:25", "yeah so we could take that we could say", "40:28", "our goal is to create a free society", "40:30", "this is this is what the word liberal", "40:32", "traditionally meant a society which", "40:34", "people are free to construct a life that", "40:36", "they want to live yeah and so if you're", "40:38", "born one race or another that should not", "40:40", "in any way be a limitation and in the", "40:42", "20th century we made a lot of progress", "40:43", "towards that ideal same thing but you", "40:45", "keep saying we did meaning that you", "40:48", "you're implying that it ended at the", "40:50", "progress hit a wall um yeah I shouldn't", "40:53", "imply that because overall I think the", "40:55", "trends are unstoppable", "40:56", "right so I don't want to say that things", "40:58", "are reverse yeah I agree but you feel", "41:00", "like there's a slowdown or not which", "41:03", "yeah I think that so so in chapter 3 of", "41:06", "the coddling Greg and I look at identity", "41:08", "politics and one thing we really try to", "41:10", "do is there's all these loaded terms and", "41:12", "you know see if somebody says social", "41:14", "justice warrior okay you know a lot", "41:16", "about them if they said that like", "41:17", "they're gonna come at it and say oh", "41:19", "those sjw's and and we don't do any of", "41:22", "that we we say there are people on", "41:26", "campus who are very focused on identity", "41:29", "issues and on injustice is based on", "41:31", "identity and that's great and there's a", "41:33", "lot to be concerned about and their", "41:35", "right to do that now how do they do it", "41:37", "and there's two different ways you can", "41:39", "either do what we call common enemy", "41:42", "identity politics which is where you say", "41:45", "life is a battle between good groups and", "41:47", "evil groups let's

everybody else and so you look at", "41:58", "you know the straight white men they're", "42:00", "the problem all the other groups must", "42:02", "unite to fight the straight white man so", "42:04", "that's that one of the core ideas of", "42:05", "intersectionality and so what we say in", "42:07", "the book is that leads to eternal", "42:09", "conflict much better is to is an", "42:12",

a", "43:56", "bunch of people that will agree with", "43:57", "them that this is in fact not racism and", "43:59", "this is pushing back on white privilege", "44:02", "and saying all these different

at this", "44:29", "they're always unpacking terms and so", "44:31", "you might try to define racism or any", "44:34", "sort of ism and you a common-sense view", "44:36", "would be an expression of

politics game or", "44:47", "the warfare game you want to define the", "44:51", "terms to give your side maximum", "44:53", "advantage so there's a wonderful social", "44:55", "psychologist named Phil

say racism", "45:26", "and microaggressions it doesn't matter", "45:29", "what the intent was all that matters is", "45:31", "the impact all that matters of what the", "45:33", "person felt that way as long as", "45:35", "someone's offended I get to charge you", "45:36", "with a crime mmm", "45:38", "so and also on racism you can say as you", "45:42", "know a lot of kids are learning in high",

teaching", "46:13", "children it's not just that it's", "46:15", "offensive and obviously hypocritical", "46:18", "it's that it's crippling yes I mean can", "46:20", "you imagine can you sew it look you've", "46:22", "got you've got kids but you have two", "46:23", "daughters and three okay see have three", "46:25", "daughters can you imagine giving your", "46:27", "daughters a cloak of

power corrupts and", "46:39", "even moral a rhetorical power", "46:41", "it's as well how is this being taught", "46:43", "though I mean houses because about", "46:45", "houses except as a part of a curriculum", "46:47", "so because the goal is not truth the", "46:50", "goal is victory over racism let's say", "46:52", "and so if that's the case you're gonna", "46:54", "focus on educating kids about their", "46:57", "white privilege and making and so that's", "47:01", "what a lot of these privilege exercises", "47:02", "are you know you line kids up by their", "47:04", "privilege and you and your goal is to", "47:06", "make the straight white boys feel bad", "47:09", "about their privilege and therefore talk", "47:12", "less take up less space their privilege", "47:14", "this is what we're talking about earlier", "47:15", "about the goal is no racism the", "47:17", "privilege only exists if there's racism", "47:20", "like instead of concentrating on the", "47:22", "privilege it only exists if people do", "47:25", "preferentially treat certain with the", "47:27", "preferential treatment towards certain", "47:29", "races if that doesn't exist at all then", "47:31", "white privilege doesn't exist why I'm", "47:33", "not sure I'm not sure I'd agree view on", "47:35", "that so we also well so we had a funny", "47:37", "episode last night and so my wife and I", "47:40", "were out in LA we were invited to the", "47:42", "Golden Globes by by a friend and so", "47:45", "we're here in LA so we we go to bed in", "47:49", "the hotel room and at 2:00 in the", "47:51", "morning the guys pounding on the door", "47:53", "saying come on let me in it's me it's me", "47:55", "and I wake up and I go to the door and I", "47:58", "and I say wrong room and he can't hear",

I", "48:08", "said you know you've got the wrong room", "48:10", "and I went back to bed and then it", "48:12", "breakfast this morning my wife says why", "48:14", "did you open the door like how could you", "48:16", "have done that I said you know we're in", "48:18", "a nice hotel I mean what's you know", "48:19", "what's gonna happen and she made it", "48:20", "clear like a woman would never have done", "48:22", "that", "48:22", "like she said you as a man you have the", "48:25", "ability to go out in the world and", "48:26", "engage with in a certain way that I", "48:27", "don't have is well yes and that's a", "48:29", "great example so there is a male", "48:31", "privilege sure exists even if there's no", "48:34", "sexism yeah that's an interesting that's", "48:37", "an interesting example that's a that's a", "48:40", "sexism one but that's also a physical", "48:42", "danger one yeah that's there's a there", "48:44", "is a difference between just the way", "48:45", "women have to go out into the world", "48:48", "being vulnerable and also being the", "48:50", "target of", "48:54", "just a male sexual attention it's a very", "48:57", "different thing it's an aggressive", "48:58", "person dangerous thing yeah but I think", "49:01", "you could say the same thing about race", "49:02", "in this way so because there's racism", "49:05", "though well okay okay you're right if if", "49:08", "there was absolute zero racism right", "49:11", "anywhere but we're never gonna get to", "49:12", "that but but the thing that we're", "49:14", "worried about is the racism so like if", "49:17", "you worried about us if someone's if you", "49:19", "say you have white privilege well that", "49:20", "only exists if you're being dealt with", "49:23", "in a racist manner so if you're a black", "49:26", "person and there is racism that's being", "49:29", "directed towards you and it's not being", "49:31", "directed towards me then you can say", "49:33", "well I have white privilege but if", "49:35", "there's no racism directed towards", "49:36", "anybody that doesn't exist anymore", "49:38", "relation is racism yes right okay but so", "49:41", "look I think it's it's helpful to always", "49:44", "try to look at it from the other", "49:46", "person's point of view sure to listen to", "49:47", "their arguments and so for example when", "49:49", "you and I go into any social encounter", "49:52", "it never occurs to me that something you", "49:55", "know something's gonna come up and", "49:56", "someone's gonna call me a kike let's say", "49:57", "right yeah because I'm Jewish", "49:59", "and it's just it just it never crosses", "50:01", "my mind that someone's gonna humiliate", "50:02", "me because I'm Jewish but if you're", "50:05", "black even if you're in a very tolerant", "50:07", "society at some point someone is going", "50:10", "to make an assumption it might happen it", "50:11", "might be so all I'm saying is you and I", "50:13", "don't there are certain things we don't", "50:15", "have to think about and that at whereas", "50:17", "if we were black or other identities or", "50:19", "visibly gay or you know there would be", "50:22", "the risk of spoiling of a social", "50:24", "interaction so I'm totally comfortable", "50:26", "saying we should be telling our kids", "50:27", "about this but what follows from it what", "50:30",

"60:32", "and I think the key idea that we need to", "60:34", "put on the table here that I think", "60:35", "everybody who works with kids needs to", "60:37", "keep in mind every day is antifragility", "60:40", "I know you've talked about that on the", "60:41", "show before yeah but I'll just I should", "60:44", "I can just give a very brief you know", "60:46", "explanation of because it's such an", "60:47", "important concept so antifragility a lot", "60:50", "of listeners when there was a word", "60:51", "coined by Nassim Taleb the guy who wrote", "60:54", "the Black Swan because there are certain", "60:56", "systems and he was I think he was", "60:57", "motivated by the collapse of the banking", "60:59", "system so he had predicted the collapse", "61:01", "because he said the banking system is", "61:04", "really convoluted and it's never been", "61:05", "tested a system needs to be tested", "61:08", "challenged shocked in order to then", "61:10", "develop defenses against it and our", "61:12", "system has not been tested so if", "61:13", "anything goes wrong it's all going down", "61:15", "all right you reference him quite a few", "61:17", "times yes that's right really concept", "61:19", "events are fragile", "61:20", "that's right it's a key idea in our book", "61:22", "and it I find as I talk about this", "61:24", "around the country once you explain this", "61:25", "to people who work with kids like", "61:26", "everybody gets it right away all right", "61:28", "so so tell em says there's no word for", "61:32", "this property he says we know that some", "61:34", "things are fragile and so if you have a", "61:36", "glass you have a wine glass on the table", "61:38", "you knock it over", "61:39", "it breaks okay it doesn't get better in", "61:41", "any way and so you know you don't give", "61:43", "kids a wine glass you give them a", "61:45", "plastic sippy cup because plastic is", "61:46", "resilient but if a kid knocks over a", "61:49", "sippy cup it doesn't get better in any", "61:51", "way until that wanted to know what's the", "61:54", "word for things that do get better when", "61:56", "you knock them over and the classic", "61:58", "example is the immune system so the", "62:00", "immune system is an incomplete system", "62:03", "it's a miracle of evolution that we have", "62:05", "this system for making you know handy", "62:06", "bodies but it doesn't know exactly what", "62:09", "to be reactive to that has to be set by", "62:11", "childhood experience and so if you keep", "62:14", "your kids in a bubble", "62:15", "and you use bacterial wipes and you", "62:18", "don't let them be exposed to bacteria", "62:20", "you're crippling the system the system", "62:22", "has to get knocked over it has to get", "62:23", "challenged threatened it has to have has", "62:26", "to learn how to it expand its abilities", "62:28", "and so so this is why peanut allergies", "62:32", "are going up yeah that was a really", "62:33", "shocking part of your book that's right", "62:34", "it's stunning how fast this happened", "62:36", "please explain that to people the whole", "62:38", "peanut allergy thing yeah so peanut", "62:40", "allergies used to be really rare and", "62:42", "most of us you know older folk we", "62:44", "brought peanut butter sandwiches to", "62:45", "school and when my son Max started", "62:48", "preschool in 2008 you know they went on", "62:52", "and on about no nuts nothing that", "62:54", "touched and not nothing that looks like", "62:55", "a nut nothing that has the word naughty", "62:56", "I mean it was crazy how defensive they", "62:58", "were about nuts and as we write in the", "63:01", "book I thought back on that and I said", "63:02", "wait a second like why you know we're", "63:04", "freaking out about nuts and the more we", "63:06", "freaked out about it", "63:07", "the higher the allergy rate goes and it", "63:09", "turns out there was a study done in", "63:10", "published in 2015 where the researchers", "63:14", "noticed that the allergy to nuts is only", "63:17", "going up in countries that tell pregnant", "63:20", "women to avoid nuts and they thought", "63:22", "well maybe that's why and so they did a", "63:25", "controlled experiment they got about 600", "63:26", "women who had given birth recently and", "63:30", "and whose kids were at higher risk of", "63:34", "analogy because they had eczema or some", "63:35", "other you know immune system sort of", "63:37", "issue so about 300 of them are told", "63:40", "standard advice your kids at risk the", "63:42", "peanut allergy so you should not eat", "63:45", "peanuts while you're lactating and keep", "63:47", "peanuts away from your kid and the other", "63:49", "half we're told

four months whenever", "63:59", "they're ready to eat and so and they", "64:02", "monitor them they made sure that they", "64:03", "weren't you know failed reactions or", "64:04", "sewer or strong reactions and then at", "64:07", "the age of five they gave them all a", "64:09", "very thorough immunological tests and of", "64:11", "the ones who followed the standard", "64:13", "advice 17% had a peanut allergy they", "64:16", "would have to watch out for peanuts for", "64:17", "the rest of their lives that's such a", "64:19", "high number because these were because", "64:21", "these were it's we're already", "64:22", "predisposed yeah and but the half that", "64:25", "were predisposed but given peanut powder", "64:27", "three percent", "64:29", "just 3% had a peanut allergy at age 5 in", "64:33", "other words we could almost wipe out", "64:34", "peanut allergies by giving peanut powder", "64:37", "to kids and site it just a few months", "64:39", "ago at science the front page article", "64:41", "was on doing that and so again good", "64:44", "intentions and bad ideas we're trying to", "64:45", "protect our kids so Oh keep them away", "64:47", "from peanuts but that's exactly the", "64:48", "wrong advice because kids are anti", "64:50", "fragile and so we're doing the same", "64:52", "thing well sync them the real issue is", "64:54", "the people that have an actual severe", "64:55", "allergy that's your child yeah yes but", "64:58", "that's what this science article was", "64:59", "about was that exposure therapies are", "65:02", "being tested and they are the most", "65:04", "effective so even with people with yes", "65:06", "extremes just have to start slow so", "65:08", "you'd so give him a very very special", "65:09", "yeah because I was on a plane once and", "65:11", "they informed us that they didn't want", "65:14", "us to even eat peanuts on the plane", "65:15", "because there was someone on the plane", "65:17", "that was so allergic that if you eat", "65:20", "peanuts and you chew it and it's in the", "65:21", "air it could adversely affect that", "65:23", "person yeah and that could well be true", "65:25", "so I have no objection to that but the", "65:26", "reason we got to that point is because", "65:29", "we started banning peanuts long ago so", "65:31", "this is one of these well I'm not sure", "65:33", "if it's a problem of progress but as we", "65:34", "know it's not necessarily but but it's", "65:38", "an example of antifragility okay so now", "65:40", "let's bring this to the playground", "65:41", "alright so you know when you and I were", "65:43", "kids you know boys and girls have", "65:45", "different social interactions but boys", "65:46", "tease each other right and salt each", "65:48", "other you throw around insults right", "65:50", "yeah and that's part of developing to be", "65:52", "a boy now if it turns into bullying like", "65:55", "a bunch of kids or one you know after", "65:58", "one kid day after day okay that's", "66:00", "terrible we have to do something about", "66:01", "that", "66:02", "I'm not saying bullying is okay but as", "66:05", "we've cracked down on bullying and as", "66:07",

conflict he comes and checks it", "66:25", "out if a kid is crying he checks it out", "66:27", "you know seems like a good thing to do", "66:30", "but it's like treating kids like they're", "66:32",

then eventually", "75:58", "interviewed their parents and said why", "76:01", "your children walking home he's like", "76:03", "because I taught him how to walk home", "76:04", "yeah yeah I showed him how to get home", "76:06", "like this is a this is a valuable thing", "76:08", "to give them the independence to leave", "76:10", "school together they look out for each", "76:12", "other and then

right so we think about", "77:09", "probabilities in very ineffective ways", "77:11", "actually do we have those graphs I sent", "77:13", "in some graphs of depression anxiety", "77:15", "rates so if we think that kids are at", "77:21", "risk of harm from letting them out but", "77:23", "we don't see that they're at risk of", "77:24", "harm from keeping them in the wrong", "77:26", "decision right

"82:44", "to that that's right that's next so if", "82:46", "we look at self-harm what you see here", "82:48", "is that the rates were fairly stable up", "82:50", "until 2009 and then bang just as in the", "82:53", "last latest same thing the rates for", "82:55", "girls go shooting up so the rate for 15", "82:57", "to 19 year old girls is up 62 percent", "83:00", "since 2009 now notice the rate
