like", "39:54", "one movie she had a diamond and then", "39:57", "booty", "39:58", "let me finish what i'm saying because", "39:59", "this is where it gets weird they said", "40:01", "that they needed it", "40:02", "to hang in their atmosphere to protect", "40:05", "them from the sun", "40:06", "because they were losing their", "40:07", "atmosphere well we're losing our", "40:09", "atmosphere",

like a reflective", "40:22", "dust in orbit so that it would mute out", "40:24", "some of the effects of the sun", "40:26", "so what they suggested what he was", "40:29", "saying", "40:30", "in 1978 is what they suggested in like", "40:33", "2018", "40:34", "right so when they're talking about how", "40:35", "to fix some of the global warming issues", "40:38", "they were literally saying some of the", "40:40", "stuff that was in this book", "40:42", "that he was reading you know he's", "40:43", "deciphering the", "40:45", "these ancient sumerian texts from six", "40:47", "thousand years ago",

figure", "41:06", "it out", "41:06", "we're not going to know who's right", "41:07", "right it's too complicated right but", "41:09", "there's a website called sitchin is", "41:11", "wrong.com and if you go there refutes", "41:13", "all of his cr i don't know who's right", "41:14", "or who's wrong", "41:15", "but it's interesting to see the argument", "41:17", "but again", "41:18", "what the

1860 whatever the", "41:49", "fuck it was all you would have is a", "41:51", "drawing and a story", "41:52", "imagine that how famous people", "41:56", "who the fuck knows but now", "42:00", "if you look at the last 200 years", "42:03", "it has accelerated like a motherfucker", "42:07", "and there's so much like", "42:10", "200 years ago people would look at", "42:14", "uh the bronco or anything like that and", "42:17", "be like what the fuck", "42:18", "yeah what is that it happened so quick", "42:21", "it's happening so quick right now i mean", "42:25", "they that spacex thing they've already", "42:28", "they've", "42:28", "figured out how to get something to fly", "42:29", "into the sky and then bring it back and", "42:31", "land it", "42:32", "it's insane yeah we are in a weird", "42:36", "fucking time and if the aliens come", "42:37", "right now it's probably the best time to", "42:40", "come we're gonna be the most relaxed", "42:41", "about it", "42:42", "no one's been able

"43:46", "they would hit you with some sound", "43:47", "that's so complex you would understand", "43:49", "exactly what they're saying even though", "43:51", "you don't know the language", "43:52",

get two", "44:26", "choices", "44:27", "eat one we eat you two you mind gold for", "44:30", "us", "44:30", "are they eating stay alive why not why", "44:32", "wouldn't they eat us they'd be like", "44:33", "listen you guys are just protein you're", "44:34", "assholes they probably", "44:36", "eat clouds yeah or like energy they", "44:38", "probably just eat energy", "44:40", "yeah they maybe they just exist in some", "44:42", "sort of uh like uh dude they're probably", "44:44", "not even", "44:44", "fucking material probably they're", "44:47", "probably just fucking", "44:48", "ethereal well maybe they figured out a", "44:51", "way to make", "44:52", "life so maybe they figured out a way", "44:55", "how to make life where you can transfer", "44:58", "your consciousness in some eternal", "45:00", "mechanical thing this is what um", "45:04", "there's this uh oh my god i can't", "45:06", "remember his name uh ray kurzweil", "45:07", "sorry uh he's a guy that's upset he's a",

his", "45:20", "consciousness into a computer", "45:22", "he's obsessed with the idea of", "45:24", "technology reaching a point where you", "45:26", "could replicate", "45:28", "uh a human being in

now that doesn't make any sense", "45:47", "right but if you go 10 years from now", "45:50", "10 years is going to the 10 years time", "45:52", "is going to be like 100 years of", "45:54", "progress", "45:54", "like you said exponentially snowballing", "45:56", "10 years after that a thousand years", "45:58", "right progress like 20 years from now i", "46:00", "don't know if those are the right",

you think the way they", "46:33", "treat their citizens", "46:34", "those people are likely to clone people", "46:38", "they're not going to give a fuck", "46:40", "they're going to want to give a fuck", "46:41", "quick quick to the jump yeah", "46:44", "we don't give a fuck i don't think", "46:45", "anybody", "46:48", "it's it's a matter of", "46:52", "it does honestly feel like oh", "46:56",

of your beard hairs um i'm working", "47:26", "on something at home i could give you", "47:27", "some i'll squeeze them later i can't", "47:29", "pluck them", "47:30", "they're not big enough to i'm not i'm", "47:32", "working on my cloning device", "47:34", "it doesn't work necessarily it might", "47:35", "work dude if it works let me know if", "47:37", "there's a little me running around i",

genetic", "47:49", "engineering they've already definitely", "47:51", "done that they've figured out how to", "47:53", "um i think it was china that did some", "47:55", "sort of crispr experiment on people's", "47:57", "dna", "47:58", "that figured out how to make them immune", "48:00", "from aids but also simultaneously made", "48:02", "them smarter", "48:03", "so made them immune to hiv i'm pretty", "48:05", "sure that's what it was what's a crisp", "48:07", "crisp oh crisper some gene editing tool", "48:10", "i don't know what the", "48:11", "it's an acronym right i don't know what",
