["00:00", "and five four three two yes how are you", "00:07", "sir", "00:07", "good thanks yep thanks for being here", "00:10", "man I wanted to ask you this because I", "00:12", "was reading this today and I starting to", "00:13", "freak out NASA is planning on drilling", "00:16", "into Yellowstone okay to save the world", "00:19", "I don't know about this you know about", "00:21", "those leaving pressure what are they", "00:22", "doing yes yeah there's the thousand I", "00:25", "wrote practi we were talking about", "00:28", "chiropractors for the started folks I", "00:30", "think they plan on like you know how", "00:33", "like if you have like a giant cyst and", "00:34", "you sort of make a slice in it you can", "00:37", "kind of squeeze everything out of there", "00:39", "you ever see a doctor do that I've seen", "00:41", "doctors do that I've never seen that to", "00:42", "do this I have no idea NASA wants to", "00:44", "send NASA wants to spend three billion", "00:47", "dollars drilling into a volcano to save", "00:49", "the United States and presumably a large", "00:52", "chunk of the world to write because", "00:53", "there would be some sort of a nuclear", "00:55", "winter type scenario where the skies", "00:58", "would be covered with this is not your", "01:01", "area of expertise I'm sorry throw this I", "01:05", "wonder about the provenance of this but", "01:07", "you know these are things that it's some", "01:10", "people's areas of expertise but no one", "01:12", "has figured everything out right like we", "01:13", "don't know all the forces that are", "01:15", "pushing around right to make volcanoes", "01:17", "and earthquakes stuff like that go back", "01:19", "to that picture look at this picture", "01:21", "yeah that picture freaks me out every", "01:26", "six to eight hundred thousand years that", "01:29", "thing blows sky-high Microsoft Paint", "01:31", "version of yeah it's from like a Geo", "01:33", "city site from 1994 yeah yeah I think", "01:37", "well here's the thing to think about", "01:38", "right and she keep this up close to you", "01:40", "pull yeah pull it we uh there's all", "01:43", "sorts of disasters that could happen to", "01:45", "us that we don't really plan for because", "01:48", "human lifetimes one hundred years", "01:50", "technology is a few hundred years but", "01:52", "maybe there are disasters that happen", "01:54", "every thousand or ten thousand years", "01:55", "right and they could be very bad I think", "01:58", "solar flares are the ones to really", "02:00", "worry about is that what you you're", "02:01", "concerned with it's not my professional", "02:03", "concern but I was one sitting next to a", "02:05", "hotshot lawyer who had just been", "02:07", "finished visiting Washington DC to", "02:10", "campaign for we got to start hardening", "02:13", "up the", "02:13", "electrical grid because one kind of", "02:16", "solar flare that he says happens every", "02:18", "thousand years could wipe out", "02:20", "electricity in the United States or the", "02:22", "world for weeks or months millions of", "02:25", "people would die right so a few billion", "02:27", "dollars and we can harden it and fix", "02:29", "things but who's gonna spend a few", "02:31", "billion dollars for something that", "02:32", "happens once every thousand years isn't", "02:34", "that the issue it's like like even with", "02:36", "preventing asteroids or doing something", "02:38", "to avoid collisions it's right now we", "02:41", "don't have an issue so we go we have", "02:44", "other things to worry about we have a", "02:45", "terrible president we have you know", "02:47", "global warming we have this we have that", "02:49", "there's always something that keeps us", "02:51", "from being rational about the future", "02:53", "yeah that's right and with the good news", "02:55", "with asteroids is that there's other", "02:56", "good reasons to look at the sky and map", "02:58", "things right yeah so the what", "03:00", "astronomers are doing are piggybacking", "03:02", "asteroid mapping strategies off of", "03:07", "things they can actually get money for", "03:08", "right because yeah no one is gonna pony", "03:10", "up that much money to look at the", "03:11", "asteroid yeah well I would think that", "03:13", "that would be like a really good use of", "03:15", "money like let's let's keep an eye on", "03:17", "the rocks that might kill everything you", "03:19", "would think that everyone would say for", "03:20", "their retirement and so forth right but", "03:22", "this ability to plan for the future not", "03:25", "what we evolved for well that's a big", "03:26", "ability I mean that's a big plan for the", "03:28", "future that I mean literally you're", "03:30", "talking about like it wasn't there one", "03:31", "that just whizzed by that was three", "03:33", "miles wide yeah but whizzed by means it", "03:36", "was something like eight times as far", "03:37", "away as the moon yeah this is not theirs", "03:41", "the chances of an asteroid even though", "03:43", "be very bad the chances of a bad one are", "03:46", "much smaller than some of these other", "03:47", "thing you don't come from me all right", "03:50", "the truth take the comforts as you will", "03:53", "but isn't there like there's a lot of", "03:55", "areas they can come from like behind the", "03:57", "Sun where the the gravity of the Sun", "03:59", "sort of distorts the the view orbit", "04:04", "right they can't stay behind the Sun", "04:06", "they sorry they can there are there's", "04:08", "what's called a LeGrande", "04:10", "the opposite where the earth is where", "04:12", "you have to hang out if you were to be", "04:15", "hidden from us for a long time and you", "04:18", "can hang out there but you would never", "04:20", "leave there so there probably are some", "04:21", "asteroids right opposite the earth just", "04:23", "like most planets have them so there's", "04:25", "sort of orbiting so what you're saying", "04:27", "there", "04:27", "once a year 180 degrees away from the", "04:30", "earth and that's what they will be doing", "04:31", "until there is it possible that one can", "04:33", "come up and hit us from the bottom", "04:35", "looking no no way the danger is", "04:40", "something from far outside the distance", "04:42", "holers oh that we just haven't this too", "04:44", "far away too dim and it wouldn't come", "04:46", "from like in Hitler the South Pole is", "04:48", "very roughly speaking we're looking at", "04:51", "the whole sky mm-hmm not just you know", "04:53", "you can see below the South Pole if", "04:55", "you're in Chile for example with lots", "04:57", "and lots of telescopes that's where they", "04:59", "have that what is the the giant one they", "05:01", "put in Chile recently that's not totally", "05:03", "operational yeah there's a whole", "05:06", "generation of telescopes I forget which", "05:08", "one it is that's there yeah but one of", "05:10", "them is it the giant Magellan telescope", "05:11", "maybe essentially I don't know what I", "05:14", "think they're just still working on now", "05:16", "and Chile's because it's because it's a", "05:18", "high altitude and the environment is", "05:20", "very it's high flat and dry yeah so", "05:23", "Hawaii's not a good place to put", "05:25", "telescopes but that's gotten in trouble", "05:27", "yeah local resistance and astronomer is", "05:30", "just not even trying to take that into", "05:33", "consideration and therefore getting", "05:34", "themselves in trouble Canary Islands are", "05:37", "ok but yet Chile is one of the best", "05:39", "places Chile and Antarctica actually", "05:40", "I've been to the Keck Observatory", "05:42", "times been three times and every time I", "05:45", "go like the first time I nailed it and", "05:48", "every time I've been since then I just", "05:49", "haven't gotten like one time we went and", "05:52", "I didn't plan for the moon I was like oh", "05:54", "there's too much moon out and it was you", "05:56", "just wasn't it was just too bright this", "05:58", "guy was too bright and then the next", "05:59", "time unfortunately we got it when it was", "06:01", "rainy and kind of cloudy we didn't get a", "06:03", "good vision but the first time the first", "06:06", "time changed my life I mean I've really", "06:08", "felt like I was on a spaceship looking", "06:10", "through a window I know what they were", "06:12", "observing I don't know but we were", "06:15", "actually just at the Visitor Center okay", "06:17", "just looking at the visitor center of", "06:19", "the sky is so magnificent at night you", "06:21", "know there's no light pollution they use", "06:23", "diffused lighting on the island you know", "06:24", "the whole deal and the the image that", "06:27", "you got from just looking up I mean just", "06:29", "with the naked eye it's just spectacular", "06:31", "just an amazing view of the Milky Way", "06:33", "the telescopes are there right yeah but", "06:35", "it gives you a perspective that I think", "06:37", "I think we're missing with our cities", "06:40", "and I think we've done something", "06:41", "amazing by creating these cities where", "06:42", "wow you know you just walk down the", "06:44", "street and get some food delivered you", "06:45", "know you can go get a car you can you", "06:47", "know go buy a TV there's all this stuff", "06:49", "in these congested areas but in putting", "06:52", "all this artificial light we've removed", "06:54", "our connection with the view of the", "06:56", "cosmos it's absolutely true now I'm the", "06:58", "biggest booster of cities I love cities", "07:00", "I love living them I think that they're", "07:01", "good for the planet etc but yeah it does", "07:04", "exactly like you said it sort of makes", "07:06", "our environments so artificial that we", "07:08", "forget I remember a great story a friend", "07:11", "of mine told me she worked for an", "07:13", "organization called project exploration", "07:14", "which is based in Chicago they were", "07:16", "devoted to bringing the wonders of", "07:18", "science to kids and minorities and so", "07:20", "forth and they do these trips from", "07:23", "Chicago on the train out to Lake Montana", "07:25", "to dig up dinosaur bones right and so", "07:28", "they were out there they get to go on a", "07:29", "ranch they get to dig up real fossils", "07:31", "bring him back and she said the thing", "07:33", "that got them the most it was most", "07:36", "affecting to them was they saw stars for", "07:38", "the first time in their lives right", "07:39", "they'd grown up in Chicago they'd never", "07:41", "seen a star in the sky and I think", "07:43", "that's a shame yeah you see like these", "07:45", "faint little flickering things you don't", "07:47", "see like a full the view of like the", "07:50", "Milky Way will you actually look up and", "07:52", "you see that white sort of stripe across", "07:54", "the sky and you realize oh my god that's", "07:55", "stars those are all stars the Milky", "07:57", "Way's the best I get dizzy looking at it", "07:59", "right knowing that we're at the edge of", "08:01", "this spinning disc whirling around and", "08:04", "if you don't get vertigo you're not", "08:05", "doing it right", "08:06", "yeah as a person who studies space do", "08:08", "you ever take time to like go out into", "08:09", "the desert and just just stare at the", "08:12", "space with nothing out there no light", "08:13", "pollution not that much you know", "08:16", "honestly the thing that I study our", "08:18", "equations and formulas and theories and", "08:20", "I use space my friends who are observers", "08:23", "go out there and collect the data and", "08:25", "figure out what ideas we have oh right", "08:27", "and which ones are wrong and I'd love it", "08:29", "when I get the chance but I don't go out", "08:31", "of my way anymore anybody else you were", "08:34", "saying that people were asking about", "08:36", "general relativity it was that the the", "08:38", "quantum quantum mechanics yeah okay", "08:40", "people on Twitter say yeah all right I", "08:41", "hope to figure out quantum mechanics for", "08:43", "the first time here well the problem is", "08:46", "not impossible I don't think I'm just", "08:49", "joking but what I meant with but it's", "08:53", "one of those things where ever", "08:54", "hoping that someone is going to be able", "08:57", "to boil it down right and simple a Neil", "08:58", "deGrasse Tyson does a very good job of", "09:00", "doing that with the cosmos he's been", "09:02", "able to boil down quite a few things on", "09:04", "this show where a lot of people want", "09:05", "thanks man", "09:06", "finally I kind of get it sorta yeah he's", "09:10", "fantastic he's an amazing ability", "09:11", "especially off-the-cuff he well it seems", "09:13", "like off the cuff I I had this vision", "09:15", "that he goes home every night and plans", "09:17", "out answers to every possible question", "09:18", "because they're so slick when he", "09:19", "delivers them he does a little cuz I've", "09:21", "heard him give the exact same semi", "09:23", "off-the-cuff but they're great so it's", "09:26", "like it's like a stand-up comedian", "09:27", "delivering a line it's new you yeah yeah", "09:31", "so what is it about it that they don't", "09:33", "understand you think quantum mechanics I", "09:35", "think that's the subject of the next", "09:38", "book that I'm writing the book I'm", "09:39", "working on right now so I'm just", "09:41", "starting thinking about it but it's not", "09:43", "just the people on the street it's my", "09:45", "professional colleagues with PhDs in", "09:46", "physics who don't understand quantum", "09:48", "mechanics and rather than being", "09:51", "embarrassed by that you know rather than", "09:53", "thinking wow this is you know a terrible", "09:55", "thing that we should devote all our", "09:56", "resources to understanding they flip it", "09:59", "they it's like Aesop's Fox and the", "10:02", "grapes you know the parable where the", "10:04", "Fox is trying to get the grapes and he", "10:05", "realizes he can't reach reach them so he", "10:07", "says I never one of them anyway they're", "10:08", "probably sour right right so that's what", "10:10", "physicists are like with quantum", "10:11", "mechanics like now if you try to", "10:13", "understand it at a deep level they", "10:15", "disrespect you you're like why are they", "10:17", "wasting your time doing that when we", "10:18", "could be calculating some number right", "10:20", "ego and knowledge it's always a weird", "10:22", "combination", "10:23", "yeah I would always always I've always", "10:24", "assumed when I was younger that well", "10:26", "when you get to the highest levels of", "10:28", "science or you know any sort of", "10:30", "intellectual pursuit that the people", "10:32", "that are really involved there wouldn't", "10:34", "be any ego issues no outsider I was like", "10:40", "well this ego and every other part of", "10:42", "the world but those super-smart dudes", "10:44", "that are figuring everything out they", "10:45", "got all that stuff locked down kind of", "10:47", "the opposite of that really I love them", "10:50", "like these are my people", "10:50", "you know and uh but but it's it's well", "10:54", "explained quantum mechanics but please", "10:56", "but but you are right I mean the I mean", "10:59", "sorry the this ego thing", "11:03", "the one thing that academia being a", "11:06", "professor right whether it's science or", "11:07", "anything else", "11:08", "is that you are constantly being", "11:10", "evaluated by every other person you meet", "11:13", "there's a hierarchy there's a rank how", "11:14", "good you are at everyone right and it's", "11:17", "not written down necessarily there's a", "11:19", "lot of rankings that appear in the", "11:20", "sports pages but everyone is judging you", "11:22", "all the time and you know my students", "11:24", "and so forth they say well I don't like", "11:26", "to ask questions in a seminar cuz I", "11:28", "worry that someone's gonna be judging me", "11:29", "and all I can say is that yes they are", "11:31", "going to be judging you John that's so", "11:33", "crazy you've met the very very very very", "11:35", "tippy top you know it's like am i number", "11:37", "two or number three right and it's yeah", "11:39", "it's very sad and it's not not", "11:41", "everyone's like that but a lot most", "11:43", "people in the field get to be like that", "11:45", "and probably it helps forward the", "11:49", "advance of science right the competitive", "11:51", "nature of competitive in logistic 'el", "11:53", "and they won't do better than everybody", "11:54", "else and prove that they're better and", "11:55", "and I'm sure Einstein and Newton were", "11:58", "just as driven by that as anybody else", "11:59", "isn't it weird it seems like human", "12:01", "beings need that comparative sort of", "12:06", "competition thing going on in order to", "12:09", "afford whatever they're doing they need", "12:11", "peers they need some sort of it helps", "12:13", "it's there yeah I mean and we live in a", "12:16", "world with scarce resources right I know", "12:18", "some of us are gonna live longer than", "12:19", "others some of us are gonna get tenure", "12:20", "and some of us are not and some of us", "12:21", "are gonna be Nobel Prize winners and", "12:23", "some are not so no matter what there's", "12:25", "gonna be competition yeah yeah and in", "12:27", "your in your field is there is a big", "12:31", "issue I guess with people disregarding", "12:33", "other people's discoveries or wanting to", "12:36", "rather like like saying like wanting to", "12:39", "poopoo things and yeah you know I think", "12:41", "this is a very complicated issue that I", "12:43", "don't really have clear because", "12:44", "certainly scientists can be very very", "12:46", "supportive of each other under the right", "12:48", "circumstances but there are they're", "12:51", "human beings there's all sorts of", "12:53", "cognitive biases that they have", "12:55", "prejudices Bayesian priors for what's", "12:58", "likely to be true what's not likely to", "13:00", "be true and it's not just perfect", "13:03", "reasoning perfect rationality right", "13:05", "people come in with their prejudices and", "13:06", "if you go and tickle their preconceived", "13:10", "notions they'll think you're great and", "13:12", "if you say something that doesn't quite", "13:13", "fit into what they're thinking about", "13:14", "them they'll sort of look somewhere else", "13:16", "- - you do you do you teach this when", "13:19", "you're teaching classes and you're", "13:22", "you're addressing potential future", "13:25", "cosmologists and quantum mechanics would", "13:28", "you say a quantum mechanics yeah would", "13:34", "you tell them like about the potential", "13:37", "pitfalls like and maybe plant a seed in", "13:39", "their head like hey you can avoid this", "13:41", "you could still be competitive but avoid", "13:43", "all these traps that are essentially", "13:45", "like these intellectual rabbit holes you", "13:47", "can go down that are really not", "13:48", "beneficial to anybody yeah I mean if I'm", "13:50", "formally teaching in class I'm standing", "13:52", "up there in front of the lecture hall", "13:54", "98% is teaching the material right", "13:56", "straightforwardly I try to dribble in", "13:58", "little words of wisdom here and there", "13:59", "and especially if I think that there is", "14:02", "a way that we always teach the subject", "14:04", "that is wrong and wrongheaded and we", "14:05", "should be doing it right I try to", "14:07", "highlight the differences but if I'm", "14:09", "advising students like my graduate", "14:11", "students or my undergraduates then I you", "14:13", "know lay on very hard my own perspective", "14:17", "on how it is to be a scientist and and", "14:19", "what is the good way to do it what's the", "14:21", "bad way to do it what are the pitfalls", "14:22", "and also just you know how to not make", "14:24", "mistakes and trip up your own career", "14:26", "yeah that's really important now what is", "14:29", "it about quantum mechanics that you", "14:32", "think people don't understand", "14:33", "well yeah everyone agrees on what we", "14:36", "don't understand there's the thing that", "14:38", "makes quantum mechanics which is our", "14:39", "single best theory of the universe in", "14:42", "some sense the thing that makes it", "14:44", "difficult to understand is that is the", "14:45", "only Theory you've ever invented where", "14:47", "there's a difference between what the", "14:50", "world is and what we see when we look at", "14:53", "the world right huh in every other", "14:55", "Theory if we look closely enough we", "14:57", "would see the world as it is and quantum", "15:00", "mechanics has this fundamental rule that", "15:03", "says you can't see the world as it is", "15:05", "you if you have an electron right a", "15:08", "particle that can be spinning clockwise", "15:10", "or counterclockwise you think that's", "15:12", "what can happen cuz every time you look", "15:14", "at it you say is it spinning clockwise", "15:15", "or spinning counterclockwise you get one", "15:17", "answer or the other but the rules of", "15:19", "quantum mechanics say when you're not", "15:21", "looking at it it's in a superposition of", "15:24", "both and you can calculate the", "15:25", "probability that you're gonna get one", "15:27", "answer or the other and this drives", "15:30", "people crazy because they think that", "15:32", "what they see is what is real and", "15:33", "therefore they have very very difficult", "15:35", "time's figuring out how to make a", "15:37", "sensible theory of quantum mechanics", "15:39", "that explains what you actually see yeah", "15:41", "even you just explaining that I'm it's", "15:44", "circling around inside my brain I'm", "15:46", "looking for like a hobby to put place", "15:48", "this yeah and like where does this go", "15:50", "what super position what yeah is he", "15:52", "saying he's saying that it's in two", "15:54", "different places at the same time or", "15:56", "that it's still and in motion at the", "15:58", "same time good right that's right so", "16:00", "exactly what you're doing right now", "16:01", "you're saying that you know there are", "16:03", "things that it can be right until in", "16:06", "motion this place that place and somehow", "16:09", "it's in both at once or something like", "16:11", "that yeah and what quantum mechanics", "16:12", "says it's not an either like if you ask", "16:14", "where is the position of the electron", "16:15", "there's no such thing as the position of", "16:19", "the electron if you look at the electron", "16:21", "you will see it in a position but that", "16:24", "is not the fundamental essence of the", "16:26", "electron there is something called the", "16:27", "quantum state or the wave function", "16:29", "there's a mathematical way that we have", "16:31", "of representing the reality of it but", "16:33", "the answers it gives us two questions", "16:35", "are just not here it is there how fast", "16:38", "it's moving etc that's not what we", "16:41", "calculate using the theory does this is", "16:44", "this sort of it mean it's very bizarre", "16:47", "right and it's very complex and is this", "16:50", "sort of lend itself to get hijacked by", "16:52", "woowoo folks so totally this is why I", "16:54", "like what the bleep like the what the", "16:56", "bleep do we know that was when I first", "16:58", "started really paying attention to this", "17:00", "stuff and then I was reading criticisms", "17:02", "of what the bleep and that's when I got", "17:04", "an understanding like okay well this is", "17:06", "kind of horseshit and this lady is kind", "17:08", "of a channeler yeah like what and", "17:10", "they're in a kind of a cult sort of a", "17:12", "deal yeah what yeah wait a minute like", "17:14", "when she was saying her name was ramped", "17:16", "thought it was like that's real name ten", "17:17", "thousand year old warriors I put that in", "17:21", "the movie like there's a lady in the", "17:23", "movie if you've seen what I and so many", "17:25", "people oh my god that changed my life", "17:27", "when we were trains my life because all", "17:29", "of a sudden they thought that like magic", "17:31", "was real and it is kind of right I mean", "17:34", "something's not magic by magic the world", "17:37", "is not magic but when you look at an", "17:38", "atom and realize that most of it is", "17:40", "space like most of the things that we're", "17:42", "looking at are mostly space and that", "17:45", "subatomic particles really do kind of", "17:47", "blink in and out of existence and you", "17:49", "look at", "17:50", "all the various quantum weirdness that", "17:54", "you is real and observable by people", "17:56", "like you that actually study the stuff", "17:58", "it looks crazy yeah in fact so I hate to", "18:01", "be that guy okay but both of the claim", "18:03", "that atoms are mostly space and the", "18:06", "claim that particles popping out of", "18:07", "existence or both entirely bullshit", "18:08", "oh please educate why do people say that", "18:12", "all the time then because they're", "18:13", "privileged in what you see when you look", "18:16", "right privilege ain't like white", "18:18", "privilege or different exactly like that", "18:19", "yeah they're there they have a view of", "18:22", "what should be okay and so there if you", "18:26", "have an electron in an atom right we", "18:28", "have a mathematical way of describing it", "18:30", "and it's a cloud it's not located", "18:32", "anywhere it's not empty space and here's", "18:35", "the electron and most of the rest of is", "18:36", "empty it's not like a little miniature", "18:38", "version of the solar system right the", "18:40", "solar system is mostly empty there's", "18:41", "empty space in between the planets and", "18:43", "if you draw a picture of the atom or", "18:45", "look at one from your high school", "18:46", "science book an atom looks just like the", "18:48", "solar system right it really is at the", "18:49", "center and these things moving around it", "18:51", "that's not what it is", "18:53", "it's a smooth cloud that is everywhere", "18:56", "inside the atom and that cloud is the", "18:59", "answer to the question were I to look", "19:02", "for the electron where would I most", "19:04", "likely see it okay and so the leap that", "19:07", "is very very hard to make is what the", "19:10", "electron truly is is that cloud it's not", "19:14", "what you see you never see the cloud", "19:16", "when you look at it you see the electron", "19:17", "in position but what it is is that cloud", "19:19", "and people just can't and so that's why", "19:22", "they talk about particles popping in and", "19:24", "out of existence there is is this", "19:26", "wavefunction this probability cloud that", "19:29", "tells you how likely is that you'll see", "19:31", "a particle and if the answer is well", "19:33", "it's very unlikely it's you know Oh", "19:35", "point zero zero one percent chance if I", "19:37", "look here and look here again look here", "19:39", "again then when you do see it you're", "19:41", "tempted to say aha a particle has popped", "19:43", "into existence the reality is there was", "19:46", "the cloud that was there all along it", "19:47", "was sitting there was not fluctuating he", "19:49", "was not changing but it's not what you", "19:51", "see and everyone from Einstein on down", "19:54", "has had a real tough time wrapping their", "19:56", "heads around that yeah I still don't get", "19:58", "it", "20:00", "so so when people say", "20:03", "that an atom is mostly empty space it's", "20:07", "not true it's mostly this it's a", "20:09", "wavefunction for the electron yeah so", "20:12", "there's this sort of very difficult to", "20:14", "describe property to it yeah and then", "20:17", "we're trying so what are we looking at", "20:19", "things like sir is sort of in a very", "20:21", "material sense like you know this mug is", "20:23", "ceramic this table is wood and we think", "20:26", "about the composition of it if we cut", "20:28", "into the ceramic we know what it looks", "20:29", "like so we're trying to apply those", "20:30", "principles to like maybe an atom yeah", "20:32", "exactly and they just don't apply", "20:34", "because it's the other way around like", "20:36", "we we think that our world that we see", "20:38", "every day is sort of basically how", "20:40", "things work and we're gonna sort of", "20:42", "translate other extremes of existence", "20:45", "into that language whether it's far away", "20:47", "or way back in time or very very small", "20:49", "or whatever but there's no reason to", "20:51", "think that our everyday life experience", "20:54", "has equipped us with the vocabulary to", "20:56", "talk about these things in any sensible", "20:57", "way and in fact it hasn't so we have a", "21:01", "very completely viable way of talking", "21:04", "about the atom we have very very", "21:06", "rigorous mathematical ways of describing", "21:08", "what happens and then quantum mechanics", "21:11", "says what you see when you look at the", "21:12", "atom is different and we just sit there", "21:15", "and insist that what we see is the real", "21:16", "way to talk about it no matter how anti", "21:19", "quantum mechanical that viewpoint really", "21:21", "is that's got to be incredibly", "21:22", "frustrating to you because I've heard", "21:24", "like legitimate mainstream scientists on", "21:26", "television talking about the atom and", "21:28", "describing it in that way oh yeah oh", "21:29", "yeah I know believe me and this is to be", "21:33", "to be super fair people disagree okay so", "21:38", "I think that people disagree about what", "21:40", "the fundamental nature of quantum", "21:42", "mechanics is and I have no problem with", "21:45", "that I mean I have a point of view and I", "21:47", "actually believe in the many-worlds", "21:48", "interpretation of quantum mechanics and", "21:50", "we can explain that and I think it is", "21:51", "perfectly sensible and coherent and fits", "21:53", "together but if you have another point", "21:57", "of view on quantum mechanics that is", "21:58", "also perfectly sensible and clear and if", "22:00", "it's together that's fine we can", "22:01", "disagree we can ask about what", "22:02", "experiments to do the sad thing is that", "22:05", "most physicists especially ones that go", "22:07", "on TV and talk about this stuff just", "22:09", "don't think about it that hard and", "22:11", "therefore they're sloppy when they talk", "22:13", "about it and they're more people come", "22:14", "away going I don't", "22:16", "get it very gettable it's totally", "22:18", "understandable again we can disagree", "22:20", "about what the understanding will", "22:21", "ultimately be but physicists contribute", "22:24", "just as much you know not on purpose but", "22:26", "they they allow they open up the space", "22:28", "for what the bleep do we know people to", "22:31", "insert their whoo in there because", "22:33", "they're not doing a very good job of", "22:34", "measuring up for the reality themselves", "22:36", "so it's it seems like it's something", "22:39", "that's intensely complex that almost", "22:41", "needs to be described with mathematics", "22:43", "which would require you to have a deep", "22:45", "understanding of that mathematics to", "22:47", "really completely grasp it is that a", "22:48", "fair assessment till my book comes out", "22:50", "yeah that's good it's not well so the", "22:55", "title of the book is something deeply", "22:56", "hidden this is a phrase from Einstein", "22:59", "and the ideas that there is something", "23:00", "real that we can get a handle on it's", "23:02", "just different than what we see and III", "23:05", "don't think that we need the", "23:07", "mathematical details to get it right", "23:09", "what we need is to have the willingness", "23:11", "to let go of our intuition a little bit", "23:14", "to up to accept the idea that the way", "23:17", "the world works at a fundamental level", "23:18", "is very different than the typical ideas", "23:22", "about space and time and stuff that we", "23:24", "are born with where were you when that", "23:26", "what the bleep movie was out were you a", "23:28", "professor yet I think so I lost a", "23:32", "prospective girlfriend over that movie", "23:33", "yeah like we met and she's like I got", "23:38", "the best movie I don't think I'm gonna", "23:41", "like it as well you gotta be open-minded", "23:43", "at least watch it and I watch it I was", "23:45", "like oh my goodness did you try to", "23:46", "explain to her that's not there was you", "23:49", "know there it was not a close call it", "23:51", "was not like oh if I explained this", "23:52", "she'll get it it's important right I", "23:56", "have a friend it was a really sad sort", "23:58", "of story I have a friend who was really", "24:02", "into the secret and she was actually a", "24:06", "friend of a friend more than a friend", "24:08", "and I ran into her at the comedy store", "24:11", "and we were talking and she was", "24:12", "explaining to me how she has sort of", "24:15", "used the the power of the secret to map", "24:19", "out her life and it was all gonna take", "24:21", "place right and I didn't see her again", "24:23", "for like like a year or so later or", "24:26", "maybe more and then the next time I saw", "24:28", "her she was", "24:29", "like I don't understand you know I", "24:31", "really thought this was gonna work and", "24:33", "my life is still a mess and my dad is a", "24:35", "loser and every guy date is a piece of", "24:38", "shit yeah", "24:40", "and she just could she couldn't get it", "24:43", "right and she was convinced that this", "24:45", "law of attraction which in my eyes is", "24:47", "very similar in a lot of ways like the", "24:49", "person the idea behind it is look you're", "24:51", "taking a bunch of people that are", "24:52", "extremely successful and you're asking", "24:54", "them how'd you do it they're like why I", "24:55", "visualize it holy shit that's got to be", "24:57", "the answer right no that's that's one", "24:59", "part of a giant thing that makes someone", "25:02", "successful yeah and luck is an even", "25:03", "bigger problem on there yeah like did", "25:06", "you imagine that you were born with two", "25:08", "legs because some people aren't right", "25:09", "yeah so when you deal with something", "25:13", "like the secret or something like the", "25:17", "you know the the rabbit hole you know", "25:19", "what the bleep there's this desire that", "25:22", "people have to find like some secret", "25:25", "message like there is here there's a", "25:28", "magical quality to the world and all you", "25:31", "have to do is think about it and look", "25:32", "about it in a certain way and your life", "25:34", "will take on this incredible quality", "25:36", "right yep and I think that it's so in my", "25:39", "last book the big picture I actually", "25:41", "devoted even though it's mostly about", "25:43", "physics and philosophy and cosmology and", "25:45", "biology I devoted a little bit to the", "25:48", "fundamental principles of reasoning and", "25:50", "especially Bayesian reasoning I know if", "25:52", "you ever heard of Bayesian reasoning I", "25:53", "have what would you describe it sure I", "25:55", "mean it's it's basically the essence of", "25:58", "it is the following idea someone tells", "25:59", "you a good idea or you come up with a", "26:01", "good idea yourself the usual thing that", "26:03", "people will do is either say that sounds", "26:06", "right it's true or that sounds wrong", "26:08", "it's false and what Bayesian reasoning", "26:11", "says is no to every possibility you say", "26:14", "okay maybe it's true maybe it's false I", "26:16", "will assign a probability to it being", "26:18", "true or false call that the prior", "26:20", "probability and then I will go collect", "26:22", "data I will say well what would the", "26:24", "world be like if this were true and then", "26:26", "I'll go look right does this woman over", "26:29", "here like me she romantically attracted", "26:31", "to me well maybe that would affect what", "26:34", "she says if I say hi to her and", "26:36", "therefore I'm gonna do the experiment", "26:37", "right and this is everything from going", "26:39", "through your everyday life to being a", "26:40", "professional scientist so look", "26:42", "read the secret be told that there's", "26:45", "this law of attraction if you understand", "26:47", "how physics works you know that it's", "26:48", "completely nonsense but if you were", "26:50", "tempted to believe it say to yourself", "26:53", "alright let me test it let me figure out", "26:55", "what whether it's true or false by", "26:57", "saying if it were true the following", "26:59", "things would happen if we were false the", "27:00", "following things would happen and that", "27:02", "little like I think that everyone thinks", "27:04", "they work that way but almost no one", "27:06", "really does hmm", "27:07", "yeah it's very difficult we have these", "27:09", "preconceived notions that we really like", "27:10", "to clean poo yeah we really like to", "27:12", "imagine that we're right about things we", "27:14", "hate to be wrong and if you once you", "27:16", "were on a path like I believe in this", "27:19", "it's super hard for people to shake that", "27:21", "loose and people generally think that", "27:22", "the probability something is true is", "27:24", "either zero or a hundred percent you", "27:26", "don't like the idea that there's", "27:27", "something is 70% true and therefore they", "27:30", "can sort of improve that or deep or", "27:32", "disprove that or whatever it's just it's", "27:35", "just hard going through life thinking", "27:36", "about probability distributions for", "27:38", "every possible version of reality but", "27:40", "that is the best way to do it if you can", "27:43", "probability distributions yes hmm is", "27:45", "that what you do when you walked on the", "27:46", "street oh yeah totally I long list of", "27:50", "numbers in my head I mean the good news", "27:51", "is you there is a certain threshold", "27:54", "right if something is 99 percent true or", "27:56", "99 percent 99.99% likely to be true get", "28:00", "on with your life all right just accept", "28:02", "that as true and don't keep trying to", "28:04", "come up with evidence for it against it", "28:06", "unless it's forced itself on you like", "28:08", "when people say that the universe is not", "28:12", "really expanding and my my field I get", "28:14", "this right like we've had evidence since", "28:16", "1920s the universe is expanding well who", "28:18", "says it's not everyone who emails me", "28:20", "everybody cuz I get emails and letters", "28:23", "and they've their own theories and the", "28:25", "light just got tired coming from these", "28:27", "other galaxies that's a herd like that", "28:29", "it's tired there's literally something", "28:31", "called the tired light fear light", "28:32", "fatigue yes exactly", "28:34", "and I'm not you know there so there's", "28:38", "some version of the scientific method", "28:40", "that says every idea should be treated", "28:42", "seriously and you should sort of write", "28:43", "down what the evidence for and against", "28:45", "this is but come on I've done that I", "28:47", "know the universe is expanding I'm not", "28:49", "gonna waste my time that's okay that's", "28:50", "why we can get through our everyday", "28:52", "lives perfectly well without being very", "28:54", "good Bayesian z' at all", "28:56", "have you had many flat earthers email", "28:58", "yeah I haven't had flat earthers email", "29:01", "me I did once tweet", "29:04", "I had one tweet mentioning the phrase", "29:06", "flat earth and I did get an invitation", "29:08", "come on a podcast a flat earth podcast", "29:09", "they have a flat earth podcast", "29:11", "I'm sure there's thousands but yeah", "29:13", "they're out there were they gonna try to", "29:15", "school you uh you know it was to their", "29:18", "credit", "29:19", "it was quite polite and you know we know", "29:22", "you don't believe this but let's come on", "29:24", "and have a conversation and we'll talk", "29:26", "to you and and we're just about you know", "29:28", "questioning things and getting in the", "29:29", "truth and about getting an education in", "29:33", "actual astronomy or astrophysicist know", "29:35", "that the crucial thing that you notice", "29:37", "whenever you talk to the many many", "29:39", "physics and astronomy crackpots out", "29:41", "there is that they're never asking", "29:43", "questions they're always like here I", "29:45", "will tell you the truth if you want to", "29:46", "know it they're never like help me learn", "29:48", "right if people if people email me and", "29:50", "say help me learn that I'm usually very", "29:51", "happy to converse with them one way or", "29:53", "the other well it's super easy to start", "29:55", "questioning things but it's very", "29:56", "difficult to get a degree in", "29:57", "astrophysics or to get a degree in", "29:59", "astronomy or to just really read books", "30:01", "about it like I getting through Lawrence", "30:03", "Krauss his last book man there's", "30:05", "chapters that I had to like go ok let's", "30:07", "go through this one more time like when", "30:09", "he came here I had to ask him like one", "30:11", "of the first things we did I feel it's", "30:13", "probably a mistake cuz it's so complex I", "30:15", "tried to get him to explain gauge", "30:17", "symmetry to me ok yeah and it was just", "30:19", "like he did it like two or three times", "30:21", "I'm like ok I'm not there's certain", "30:25", "parts about it that are really hard yeah", "30:28", "whereas and we can try that again if you", "30:29", "want but it is there are hard things", "30:31", "yeah that's ok you would be surprised if", "30:33", "there weren't right like of course you", "30:35", "force 500 years learning about the", "30:37", "universe and everything's made perfect", "30:38", "sense the first time that would be kind", "30:40", "of remarkable no yeah it's it's super", "30:42", "complex and I guess that makes sense it", "30:44", "makes sense that it would be now when", "30:46", "someone boils it down to something", "30:47", "that's really woo", "30:48", "like you know what in the bleep do we", "30:50", "know but how is that very frustrating to", "30:54", "you like what does it mean that must", "30:55", "make you communicating with people that", "30:58", "have seen that and have these ideas that", "31:00", "are false assumptions based on it sort", "31:02", "of like I've said to you that atoms are", "31:04", "mostly Hollow yeah what does that", "31:06", "frustrating I mean what is that like", "31:07", "it's frustrating at different levels", "31:09", "you know I think I my first impulse is", "31:14", "to be charmed and happy when people care", "31:17", "people are even interested I'm very", "31:20", "positive of you yeah like I first want", "31:22", "to give people credit and see if there's", "31:25", "something inside them with that we can", "31:27", "work with and try to work toward the", "31:28", "truth right but then yeah so and I think", "31:31", "most people maybe are like that and", "31:33", "there's some hard core people who have", "31:35", "made up their minds about the craziness", "31:36", "I mean you see where it would come from", "31:38", "right because quantum mechanics says", "31:40", "what the world is is different than what", "31:43", "we see when we look at it so it's a", "31:45", "small leap from that correct statement", "31:47", "to we bring the world into existence by", "31:49", "looking at it right breath and your", "31:51", "Deepak Chopra and Deepak he's found me", "31:53", "on Twitter so whenever I tweet something", "31:55", "about quantum mechanics he you know", "31:57", "retweets it with something but it's all", "31:59", "in your mind it's all consciousness", "32:00", "bringing the world into existence", "32:02", "he loves word salad yeah that guy is the", "32:05", "biggest like dealer of worlds word salad", "32:09", "yeah the world has ever seen this is", "32:11", "putting them the word salad into a", "32:13", "recipe that people think is nutritious", "32:15", "for them right they really like to eat", "32:17", "even though there's no actual", "32:19", "nutritional value well there's you get a", "32:20", "lot of that from like certain yoga", "32:22", "classes like there's certain yoga", "32:24", "classes that I go to where like the yoga", "32:26", "teacher will start talking some woowoo", "32:28", "shit and like your be in the middle of", "32:29", "the pose and like what you know is", "32:35", "helping me with that yeah I smile my way", "32:37", "through but it's weird that that stuff", "32:42", "is all can excited that's all sort of", "32:44", "kind of in that sort of genre of people", "32:48", "that are trying to improve their life or", "32:50", "be spiritual or they love that Deepak", "32:53", "Chopra shit like I've had that I had", "32:55", "this conversation with a friend of mine", "32:56", "who's like you give me a Deepak Chopra", "32:59", "book and I started going through it it's", "33:02", "like I go you know this guy's crazy", "33:04", "right he probably wants to do well like", "33:07", "probably not a terrible person probably", "33:09", "wants to do well but he's also ignoring", "33:11", "the actual scientists that study all", "33:13", "this stuff and he's sort of pitching", "33:16", "this thing that what what it is like", "33:19", "this Deepak Chopra ISM this sort of like", "33:21", "spiritual pseudo", "33:23", "spiritual view of the world that he's", "33:25", "pitching to like these these middle-aged", "33:29", "housewives yeah they're like looking for", "33:31", "some sort of a meaning to life but they", "33:33", "don't like going to church", "33:34", "yeah and Daniel Dennett the philosopher", "33:36", "came up with a great word for it he", "33:37", "calls them deputies when you string some", "33:40", "words together in a way that sounds", "33:41", "extremely profound but you look closely", "33:43", "at it and doesn't actually mean anything", "33:45", "at all you know there's a website", "33:46", "that'll do that for you oh the Deepak", "33:48", "Chopra quote yes I would like to laugh", "33:52", "but there's another website that comes", "33:53", "up with random physics paper titles and", "33:56", "it's not that day usually tell the", "34:00", "physics stuff is it's almost beat I", "34:02", "guess there's there's similar issues", "34:04", "with the reason why I deep rock can do", "34:07", "that is because most people don't", "34:08", "understand what he's talking about", "34:10", "so if you say a lot of stuff about", "34:11", "things that people don't understand like", "34:13", "I've had weave there's been a bunch of", "34:15", "videos that we played on this podcast", "34:17", "about fake martial arts practitioners", "34:20", "there's a whole business in these people", "34:25", "that have these fake martial arts", "34:27", "techniques and they use all these huge", "34:29", "words that are very very rare about the", "34:32", "central nervous system and about the you", "34:35", "know the structure of the body and", "34:36", "they'll they'll use all this stuff to", "34:39", "try to get you think like oh well this", "34:41", "guy obviously is a enormous vocabulary", "34:43", "and a deep understanding of anatomy he", "34:45", "must therefore be this she mastered that", "34:48", "he's pretending to be it's kind of very", "34:50", "similar so I kind of recognized that", "34:51", "pattern in the woowoo people like oh I", "34:54", "kind of see what you're doing you're", "34:55", "throwing a bunch of very complicated", "34:57", "words that aren't in most people's", "34:58", "vernacular and you're saying them in a", "35:00", "way that makes me feel like you have", "35:03", "some sort of a connection to the the Chi", "35:05", "into the chakras into the the inner or", "35:08", "whatever that everybody's trying to", "35:09", "reach to be happy yeah and another", "35:11", "problem is just that whenever there is a", "35:13", "field whether it's physics or medicine", "35:14", "or whatever where we know something but", "35:17", "it's hard complicated counterintuitive", "35:19", "when we explain it we translate it right", "35:22", "you know in physics we have mathematical", "35:24", "equations that are quite unambiguous as", "35:26", "to what they say but then we use words", "35:28", "we say well there's a cloud there's a", "35:30", "probability etcetera and every", "35:32", "translation is inaccurate in some sense", "35:35", "so if you were basing your beliefs", "35:37", "off the translations then you can fudge", "35:40", "them a little bit more to get almost", "35:41", "wherever you want to go Oh", "35:43", "confused me more I was good with the", "35:46", "cloud up until now why is it a cloud", "35:48", "like why when you're describing where", "35:50", "the electron it inhabits why is it a", "35:52", "cloud", "35:53", "well it's if you're thinking about the", "35:55", "electron the what the wavefunction is", "35:58", "sort of how we use it is you ask the", "36:01", "question if I were to look for the", "36:04", "location of the electron right there's a", "36:06", "machine that tells me the answer there's", "36:08", "a probability of seeing it here with a", "36:10", "certain number of probability of seeing", "36:12", "it their probability seeing it somewhere", "36:13", "else and so at every point in space", "36:16", "there's a number the probability you", "36:19", "will see the electron there right and so", "36:21", "if you visualize all those probabilities", "36:22", "all at once it looks like a cloud that", "36:24", "is filling up all of space and then the", "36:27", "leap is to say there's no such thing as", "36:29", "where the electron is there's only the", "36:31", "cloud it's not like the cloud is", "36:33", "expressing your ignorance of where the", "36:35", "electron really is the cloud is what", "36:38", "there really is and and I sound exactly", "36:43", "like Deepak Chopra but there's no way no", "36:45", "no you don't bore versus electron cloud", "36:48", "oh yeah here we go that's right yeah so", "36:53", "on the Left these are this is the", "36:54", "picture we like to draw electrons", "36:56", "orbiting around as if they were little", "36:58", "planets in the solar system on the right", "37:00", "is closer to reality but you see even", "37:03", "there they couldn't quite resist the", "37:07", "temptation to make it pointillist and", "37:08", "little dots yeah this really should be", "37:11", "some smooth distribution this is well", "37:14", "the physicists would call the thing on", "37:16", "the right the wave function or the", "37:18", "quantum state of the electron and it is", "37:20", "that cloud and it answers the question", "37:23", "what's the likelihood that we see it in", "37:25", "different places the hard part to", "37:27", "mentally get to is that the cloud is", "37:29", "what is real is it almost like like what", "37:33", "we're looking at here with all these", "37:34", "dots here and it says it was James with", "37:36", "go back to where it was that please", "37:37", "where it says the probability of the", "37:40", "density of electron and then you see all", "37:42", "those dots is the issue like making a", "37:45", "visual representation of it almost like", "37:48", "like if I ask someone to draw a visual", "37:50", "representation of a", "37:51", "thought yeah it's something like that", "37:53", "exactly because we're used to stuff", "37:55", "coffee cups", "37:57", "yeah the water like they have locations", "37:59", "in space they have a shape a size so we", "38:01", "believe in dots yeah exactly but it's", "38:03", "hard to draw them right where's that", "38:05", "going where the hell's that I mean", "38:06", "that's the most important thing that", "38:08", "we've ever had when it comes to the", "38:09", "creation of civilization inventions", "38:11", "innovation creativity all those things", "38:14", "are just thoughts and tried draw thought", "38:17", "right but we're intuitive we get that", "38:21", "it's hard to draw a song right but okay", "38:24", "know what it is these draw the musical", "38:26", "notes and yeah and so if you talk about", "38:31", "an electron that's supposed to be a", "38:32", "thing right supposed to be somewhere", "38:35", "that I can like find it and someone", "38:39", "comes along and says no Nature is", "38:41", "totally different than that and you will", "38:44", "never in your life be able to see with", "38:46", "perfectly clear eye glasses what nature", "38:49", "is really like they get a little", "38:51", "annoying but it's the truth", "38:52", "what do you think about the very bizarre", "38:55", "theory that the universe is incredibly", "38:58", "fractal in the sense that what we're", "39:01", "looking at when we look in the universe", "39:02", "is essentially some sort of subatomic", "39:05", "particles for a much larger atom and", "39:07", "then it goes bigger and bigger and then", "39:09", "there's a human out there", "39:11", "I don't think also a part of another", "39:13", "galaxy that's also part of another", "39:15", "universe it's also a part of another", "39:17", "atom that's also a no I get it but no I", "39:19", "think though the closest thing that is a", "39:22", "little bit more reasonable to that well", "39:23", "so let's go the other way around", "39:25", "yeah well let me ask me or let me ask", "39:28", "you why is it no well so let's go the", "39:31", "other way around let's let's let's ask", "39:32", "if maybe what we think of as atoms could", "39:36", "be alive with like little people and", "39:37", "substructure we just don't know about so", "39:40", "if you're an honest conscientious", "39:43", "scientist you always say we don't know", "39:44", "for sure right but what we everything", "39:47", "that we think we know about quantum", "39:48", "mechanics says that things like", "39:50", "electrons and quarks are completely", "39:52", "featureless that if you tried to put", "39:55", "little wrinkles and and make them", "39:57", "different like the earth and Venus and", "39:58", "Mars are very different from each other", "40:00", "every electron is exactly the same as", "40:02", "every other", "40:03", "John and if you tried to give it any", "40:04", "distinguishing features it would cost an", "40:06", "enormous amount of energy energy that's", "40:09", "just not there so there's fundamental", "40:10", "principles of physics that says that", "40:12", "there are no people living on atoms okay", "40:14", "and so what we're like with our solar", "40:17", "system even though kind of vaguely", "40:18", "resembles an atom in some sense we are", "40:20", "nothing like real atoms we could not be", "40:23", "packed together to make a solid object", "40:24", "in this bigger world or anything like", "40:26", "that", "40:27", "so the so our existence efficiently", "40:30", "different from the subatomic realm that", "40:32", "I see no way that we could be the same", "40:34", "thing as the subatomic realm to some", "40:36", "bigger people I do think we could be", "40:38", "living in a simulation as Elon Musk", "40:40", "famously suggested we could be all", "40:43", "living in a computer simulation I don't", "40:44", "think it's likely but it's completely", "40:45", "plausible given what we know right now", "40:47", "where the real issue is that one day we", "40:49", "most likely will have something as long", "40:52", "as technology continues to exponentially", "40:54", "advance will one day have something", "40:57", "that's indiscernible from the reality", "40:59", "they'll be able to interface more than", "41:01", "likely yeah they'll be able to interface", "41:02", "with your senses with the way the mind", "41:05", "perceives reality and create something", "41:07", "yet that passes that uncanny valley and", "41:11", "literally feels like like real life like", "41:13", "yay tricks I think that might be very", "41:15", "far or we might be pretty close I think", "41:17", "it's hard to tell because there's so", "41:18", "much we don't know right now it's not", "41:19", "like this is coming in the next 10 years", "41:20", "but it could be a thousand but yeah", "41:22", "absolutely that it could you know the", "41:24", "the thought experiment that that helps", "41:26", "people accept this is you know a single", "41:29", "neuron in your brain you have something", "41:31", "like I know 100 billion neurons in your", "41:32", "brain but every single one is not that", "41:35", "complicated it takes in some inputs it", "41:36", "puts in some outputs it might be work to", "41:39", "figure out exactly what it does but it's", "41:41", "not mysterious right so we could imagine", "41:44", "replacing one neuron in your brain with", "41:47", "a solid-state micro device that does", "41:51", "exactly the same thing as that neuron", "41:53", "and you would be the same person roughly", "41:56", "speaking right mm-hmm so okay so if you", "41:58", "believe that then do that with two", "42:00", "neurons and do it with three neurons and", "42:02", "you're gradually building up who you are", "42:04", "but just replacing your brain with", "42:06", "something that is machine made and if", "42:09", "you believe that can happen there's no", "42:10", "reason to think that machines can't be", "42:12", "as human as we want them to be do you", "42:14", "follow any array Kurzweil", "42:16", "a little bit I don't think that he's an", "42:19", "especially deep thinker but he's a good", "42:22", "he's right now pounding on his desk it", "42:25", "could be this mother fucker you don't", "42:28", "think he's as especially deep thinker I", "42:29", "mean he's a brilliant guys invented a", "42:31", "bunch of really fascinating things yeah", "42:34", "he likes to extrapolate without without", "42:37", "limit pretty fearless Lee well he must", "42:40", "have irritated you for you to jump right", "42:41", "out with I don't think he's a", "42:42", "particularly deep thinker no but I do", "42:44", "think he serves a role I think it you", "42:45", "know there are people who make us think", "42:48", "more deeply right like I remember seeing", "42:51", "a panel discussion with Murray Gelman", "42:54", "who was a famous physicist and Isaac", "42:55", "Asimov", "42:56", "this was like 30 years ago and as well", "42:58", "was still alive and there was some", "43:00", "someone else who's on the panel I forget", "43:02", "it was another physicist and the amazing", "43:05", "thing was the science fiction author was", "43:07", "by far the most conservative thinker up", "43:10", "there in terms of what he thought would", "43:12", "really be happening a thousand years", "43:14", "from now right the physicist had these", "43:15", "weigh out ideas and Asimov was like yeah", "43:17", "I don't think it's gonna be all that", "43:18", "different right and it's hard to predict", "43:22", "the future accurately and there's a role", "43:24", "serve both by trying to be as realistic", "43:26", "as possible and careful and Bayesian and", "43:29", "saying what are the probabilities and so", "43:30", "forth there's another role served by", "43:32", "just being the provocative and saying", "43:35", "well maybe this crazy thing is gonna", "43:36", "happen maybe we'll cure death in the", "43:38", "next hundred years and life will change", "43:40", "for everybody dramatically that seems", "43:42", "fairly likely right there they'll be", "43:44", "gonna figure out some way to reverse", "43:46", "aging yeah I think that's plausible", "43:47", "there's no biological reason why not", "43:49", "Kurzweil has got some weird motivations", "43:50", "to he literally wants to sort of rebuild", "43:55", "his father yeah yeah he wants to be able", "43:58", "to piece together some sort of an", "44:00", "artificial intelligence version of his", "44:03", "father and go back and see him yep", "44:05", "that's deep that's a word for it yeah", "44:08", "yeah he fit he thinks that there's going", "44:13", "to come a time inside his lifetime", "44:16", "hopefully that you'll be able to", "44:18", "download consciousness that", "44:20", "consciousness is going to be something", "44:22", "you'll transfer sort of like you know", "44:25", "code yeah I think that there's", "44:27", "there's a difference between you know", "44:29", "what is potentially possible given", "44:32", "arbitrary amounts of time and resources", "44:34", "and what is realistic in the relatively", "44:36", "near term by the near term we mean fifty", "44:38", "or hundred years right and I think that", "44:40", "people like Ray Kurzweil are far", "44:43", "exaggerating what's going to be possible", "44:45", "in the next fifty or hundred years", "44:46", "because they underestimate how little we", "44:49", "know about how the brain works how", "44:50", "important it is for the bane bring to be", "44:52", "in our bodies right mm-hm we you know", "44:55", "one of the one of the breakthroughs and", "44:57", "artificial intelligence over the last", "44:58", "couple decades was to realize that if", "44:59", "you try to build an artificially", "45:01", "intelligent computer it's it becomes", "45:04", "much more realistic if you give it a", "45:06", "body if you give it a face and it can", "45:08", "interact with people I mean we", "45:09", "underestimate the extent to which having", "45:11", "a body is an important part of how we", "45:13", "think and who we are and these this is", "45:15", "just like such baby steps in", "45:17", "understanding this stuff that to imagine", "45:19", "that in the matter of decades we'll have", "45:20", "it all figured out and have downloadable", "45:22", "consciousnesses it's not realistic to me", "45:24", "do you think we do we have to absolutely", "45:26", "understand the exact way that the human", "45:29", "brain works in order to replicate its", "45:31", "possibilities no I mean I think that we", "45:35", "probably won't that probably won't be", "45:37", "the way that we make artificial", "45:39", "consciousness or artificial intelligence", "45:41", "like we won't just be reconstructing", "45:43", "human beings like when we made cars we", "45:46", "didn't reconstruct horses right we just", "45:48", "did it in a very very different way and", "45:49", "cars are much better than horses in in", "45:51", "various ways not as good in other ways", "45:54", "like going on the hills going up hills", "45:56", "but also in the early days of cars one", "45:59", "big complaint was but if I'm drunk and", "46:01", "passed out it won't take me home because", "46:06", "the horse would just take you home and", "46:08", "knows how to get there exactly nobody", "46:11", "gets mad self-driving cars will be able", "46:12", "to do it final if you're driving a horse", "46:14", "drunk nobody gives a shit know you're", "46:15", "passed out that's right yeah that'd be", "46:17", "like a big adjustment for people yeah", "46:19", "exactly we're driving drunk and so the", "46:21", "idea that the way that we'll make", "46:23", "artificial intelligence is to sort of", "46:24", "mimic a human being is just crazy", "46:27", "now that's that's not how it's gonna be", "46:28", "what do you think it's gonna be like", "46:29", "well I don't know there are there are", "46:32", "the problems that can be solved by", "46:34", "things that we design are just a", "46:37", "different set of problems than the thing", "46:39", "that evolution naturally made us", "46:41", "do-right like evolution built a very", "46:43", "very general purpose machine that is", "46:46", "inefficient and irrational in all sorts", "46:48", "of ways like anyone's pocket calculator", "46:51", "since the 1970s can multiply numbers way", "46:53", "better than your brain can right your", "46:55", "brain has enormous ly more computational", "46:57", "capacity than a pocket calculator why", "46:59", "can't we multiply numbers that ability", "47:02", "was not important back when we were", "47:03", "evolving these things right so the set", "47:06", "of things that it is easy to design is", "47:08", "just very very different than what the", "47:09", "brain does so who knows I don't know", "47:11", "exactly what will be the world will look", "47:13", "like I actually think that the more", "47:14", "important thing will be blurring the", "47:16", "distinction between human beings and", "47:18", "machines you know the the crossovers is", "47:21", "another one of Elon Musk's project is", "47:23", "called the neural link the idea of you", "47:26", "know basically a neural lace something", "47:27", "that is just interfacing with your brain", "47:29", "very very very fast", "47:31", "so that you have access to the entire", "47:32", "internet or whatever peripherals you", "47:35", "want in real time so learn Wikipedia is", "47:37", "part of your memory essentially and", "47:39", "that's just who you are now you walk", "47:40", "around and you can multiply numbers as", "47:42", "fast as you want to that seems like very", "47:44", "likely yeah that augmented reality yeah", "47:48", "and in some sort of a weird symbiotic", "47:51", "connection to the net into electronics", "47:55", "whether it's a wearable thing or maybe", "47:56", "even an embedded thing yeah that's I", "47:58", "think will be embedded either so yeah", "48:00", "this is more efficient will you will you", "48:03", "be one of the first adopters are you", "48:04", "gonna wait a little while I'm never a", "48:06", "first generation it up or even if iPhone", "48:07", "that's much less you know things", "48:09", "embedded in my body but look I just", "48:11", "adopted two kittens they get microchip", "48:13", "implants oh yeah you adopt a cat to get", "48:15", "some microchip inside so you can't lose", "48:17", "it yeah and so to think that we're very", "48:19", "far away from doing that I don't think", "48:21", "is right I think that we're gonna be", "48:22", "doing things I was just looking at a", "48:24", "laptop bag it's a laptop bag that also", "48:28", "is you have a passport bag and a laptop", "48:31", "bag and then a carry-on and then a check", "48:35", "and stow you know on a four airplane", "48:37", "airplane luggage and all of it is", "48:39", "bluetooth and all of it is location", "48:41", "coordinated with GPS so that if somehow", "48:44", "another your bag gets lost you literally", "48:46", "can go on a computer and I'll show you", "48:47", "where your bag is yeah it's like whoa", "48:50", "yeah how long we gonna when we gonna do", "48:52", "that with people and I feel you know I", "48:54", "I'm a big believer in privacy rights and", "48:57", "so forth her dilemma do I let my", "48:59", "employer microchip me what is this there", "49:01", "you go there's a company in Wisconsin", "49:03", "that had microchip day on August first", "49:05", "and they implanted microchips in people", "49:07", "first of all that dude with his ears in", "49:11",

"50:29", "is that people believe that in quantum", "50:33", "physics it's been proven that if you", "50:35", "look at things that you looking at", "50:37", "things changes those things but the way",

give", "53:14", "give me some volume so I can hear this", "53:15", "is from what yeah", "53:17", "yeah the double-slit experiment right", "53:21", "see when we add the second slit", "53:32",

tiny", "54:34", "marbles right I can do the guy I know", "54:40", "exactly what they're talking about is", "54:41", "very famous experiment so yeah so if you", "54:44", "have two slits that you let marbles go", "54:47", "through they get two slits in the", "54:49", "receiving screen on the other side right", "54:52", "whereas if you let a wave go through two", "54:54", "slits you get this

than a particle but the real", "55:05", "weird thing that they're gonna get to", "55:07", "eventually is if you have if you let an", "55:09", "electron go through two slits but you", "55:12", "put little detectors on the slits so you", "55:15", "say which detect which slit did the", "55:17", "electron go through then it always says", "55:20", "it goes through one or the other", "55:22", "it never goes through both and the", "55:24", "interference pattern on the other side", "55:26", "disappears you only see the two lines", "55:29", "that you would have seen if they were", "55:30",

is the lesson", "55:40", "of the double slit experiment right why", "55:44", "why because when you put that detector", "55:47", "on the slits you interacted with the", "55:50", "electron and you localized it right", "55:53", "there was no such thing as the position", "55:55", "of the electron there's no such thing as", "55:56", "the answer to the question did it go", "55:58", "through one

through the slits to see did it", "56:08", "go through this one or this one and that", "56:10", "effect changed it from being going", "56:13", "through both slits to being only going", "56:14", "through one and how does it affect it", "56:16", "like that", "56:16", "well there's it's what what's called", "56:18", "quantum entanglement the detector", "56:20", "becomes entangled with the electron and", "56:24", "this is where you get into what I my", "56:25", "favorite version of quantum mechanics", "56:27", "which is the many-worlds interpretation", "56:29", "the the right way to think about the", "56:32", "electron was that cloud that wave going", "56:34", "through that's the natural thing the", "56:36", "weird thing is that when you look at the", "56:38", "different slits you only see it go", "56:40", "through one or the other and acts like a", "56:41", "particle so how do you explain that so", "56:44", "in other words our natural intuitive way", "56:46", "things that electrons is as particles", "56:48", "little marbles and quantum mechanics", "56:49", "says no no no it's naturally a wave the", "56:52", "weird thing is when it acts like a", "56:53", "particle and if your many-worlds person", "56:56", "what the answer you give is the", "56:58", "following when you look to see did the", "57:00", "electron go through one slit or the", "57:02", "other you or whatever video camera you", "57:05", "had or whatever becomes entangled with", "57:08", "the electron and what that means is that", "57:10", "the wave function of the whole universe", "57:12", "the wave function of both the electron", "57:14", "but also your camera and you and the", "57:16", "stars and galaxies and so forth splits", "57:18", "in two and there's now one branch of the", "57:21", "wave function which which acts like it's", "57:23", "own separate world which says the", "57:26", "electron went through the left slit and", "57:28", "your camera saw it go through the left",

go", "57:37", "through the right slit and it makes a", "57:38", "line on the other side and so they're", "57:40", "both still there but the world split in", "57:43", "two and now you're only in one of", "57:44", "you don't see the whole world anymore", "57:46", "you managed to make it more confusing", "57:49", "congratulations you screwed my head up", "57:52", "even more I did that I understand it", "57:53", "less now that's even more baffling but", "57:56", "the bit you understand is actually true", "57:57", "that's illusion of understanding doesn't", "58:02", "count okay so by not understanding I", "58:05", "understand more likely there you go you", "58:08", "have a weird job it's a very very weird", "58:12", "job well I get it now though in talking", "58:16", "to you why you know you have the Deepak", "58:18", "Chopra's of the world and why you have", "58:21", "like the what the bleeps because it's so", "58:24", "intensely confusing yeah and especially", "58:27", "with the limitations of language of", "58:30", "right just it's counterintuitive it's", "58:31", "against every little bit of our everyday", "58:33", "experience it's a set of concepts that", "58:35",

have", "58:52", "that kind of weird conversations with", "58:55", "people like myself that sort of lack the", "58:56", "tools to really truly understand what", "58:59", "you're saying", "59:00", "what is what is that like I mean it's", "59:03", "got to be frustrating in a sense or no I", "59:05", "love it yeah yeah I do yeah that's great", "59:08", "because what a great attitude I was", "59:10", "there I that used to be me like it's not", "59:12", "like my brain was born ready to I'm", "59:14", "saying quantum mechanics I worked at it", "59:16", "and struggled with it and got it wrong", "59:17", "and who knows maybe ten years from now", "59:19", "I'll think oh I was so stupid ten years", "59:21", "ago right but I think that it can be", "59:24", "understood I think that people who want", "59:26", "to try to understand it number one are", "59:29", "already 90% of the way to being awesome", "59:31", "and number two the remaining 10% is very", "59:34", "very achievable it is understandable", "59:36", "wasn't it Fineman that said if you think", "59:38", "you understand quantum mechanics you", "59:39", "don't understand quantum mechanics he", "59:41", "said something like that he said he can", "59:43", "safely say that nobody understands", "59:45", "quantum mechanics yeah which is fine", "59:47", "except that you should therefore be", "59:50", "outraged you should not be proud he was", "59:54", "kind of a funny guy yeah he was being", "59:56", "funny and I think that it", "59:57", "certainly true that we don't understand", "59:59", "quantum mechanics if I understand you", "60:01", "mean both understand and everyone else", "60:03", "agrees that you understand right maybe", "60:06", "someone understands it but certainly", "60:07", "there's no consensus on the right way to", "60:09", "understand it mmm no consensus and the", "60:11", "right way to understand it is a very", "60:13", "disturbing concept to people like me we", "60:15", "want you to say well water is wet and", "60:17", "oxygen is this and this you know this is", "60:19", "what wood is I think a thousand years", "60:21", "from now historians of science will look", "60:23", "back on the 20th century and shake their", "60:25", "heads in despair they'll say look you", "60:27", "guys quantum mechanics fell into your", "60:29", "lap and you didn't spend any time", "60:31", "thinking about it you didn't try very", "60:33", "hard to understand it that's", "60:34", "embarrassing really yeah like the", "60:36", "general public or science no", "60:37", "professional scientific people with PhDs", "60:39", "in theoretical for a while so when it", "60:43", "comes to the people you were talking", "60:44", "about like scientists who sort of", "60:45", "dismiss quantum mechanics what are they", "60:48", "dismissing and how are they doing it", "60:49", "well to be very very clear they're not", "60:51", "dismissing quantum mechanics they use", "60:53", "quantum mechanics every day they love", "60:55", "quantum mechanics quantum Kanak Sapir", "60:58", "calculating what's going to happen in", "61:00", "your experiment that is of unprecedented", "61:02", "precision it's really the

press them on ok", "61:11", "what was really happening", "61:13", "what is the description of reality that", "61:16", "corresponds to the calculation you just", "61:18", "did they get annoyed and frustrated with", "61:20", "you rather than give you an answer to", "61:21", "the question how sound like with it they", "61:25", "get annoyed and frustrated with you like", "61:27", "when you have these conversations these", "61:28", "people with anyone yeah they will you", "61:30", "will because well they don't understand", "61:33", "which is fine but they act as if not", "61:36", "understanding it is ok and to me that is", "61:38", "not fine they will say my job is not to", "61:40", "understand the world's just to make", "61:42", "predictions I think it's not really the", "61:44", "job of science or physics at all their", "61:48", "job is not to understand it's to make", "61:49", "predictions well how can you make", "61:50", "predictions if you don't understand what", "61:52", "you're making well that's that is", "61:53", "exactly the situation with quantum", "61:55", "mechanics right now like we have a", "61:56", "recipe we have an algorithm you know a", "61:58", "set of rules do this do this do this you", "62:00", "get an answer right and the answer is", "62:02", "right the answer is verified and", "62:03", "experiments over and over again and you", "62:05", "say well K why is it right what was", "62:06", "happening what is the thing that is", "62:08", "moving around and they go I don't know", "62:09", "don't ask me about that", "62:11", "that's hilarious now what do you do most", "62:14", "of the time when you're not teaching", "62:17", "right so like if you're working on this", "62:18", "stuff like I would imagine there's not", "62:21", "someone telling you what to do right so", "62:23", "when you're at all when you're working", "62:25", "on this kind of stuff like how do you", "62:27", "structure it yeah it's up to you you", "62:29", "know there's a sort of a selection", "62:30", "effect that that the ability to", "62:32", "structure it on your own is necessary to", "62:34", "get to a certain stage in your career", "62:36", "but yeah I have students graduate", "62:40", "students who I work with as well as", "62:41", "other colleagues that I collaborate with", "62:42", "but it's roughly speaking going into the", "62:45", "office or going to a cafe sitting down", "62:47", "with a piece of paper and a pencil and", "62:49", "writing that's what I do that's my job", "62:51", "you go to office or cafe yeah and you", "62:53", "sit down with like one of these yellow", "62:55", "legal pads yep and you write all that", "62:56", "chicken scratch that nobody understands", "62:58", "but you guys yep I've recently changed", "63:00", "now I have an iPad pro with an Apple", "63:02", "pencil and I do oh you do all that only", "63:04", "very very recently upgraded but if you", "63:06", "can get yourself when I'm saying Samsung", "63:08", "Note eights that has the pen on it have", "63:10", "you seen that you can yeah while the", "63:14", "screen is dark like this you don't have", "63:16", "to turn the screen on you pull out the", "63:17", "stylus and you can draw notes on a", "63:19", "screen okay up to like a hundred and", "63:22", "eighty pages of notes yeah like on the", "63:24", "actual screen itself you don't even have", "63:26", "to open it up alright that's pretty cool", "63:28", "but now I'm invested now I got the iPad", "63:30", "so I know that's how it works right but", "63:31", "the things the difference is you can", "63:33", "carry that around your pocket yeah I", "63:35", "know that is a difference yeah so when", "63:38", "the idea is that you know we there's a", "63:40", "set of questions in our brains as", "63:42", "professional physicist there's an", "63:43", "infinite number of questions but at any", "63:44", "one time you're focusing on a couple and", "63:46", "you have a couple of ideas and so you", "63:49", "know you say to yourself well maybe if", "63:52", "things are like this then this would", "63:53", "follow and let's try to calculate what", "63:55", "that would lead to and does that lead us", "63:57", "someplace good or is that just crash and", "63:59", "burn and that's what you do over and", "64:01", "over again until you get a paper you can", "64:02", "write and where do you start from like", "64:04", "what is uh like well like say you get to", "64:06", "the cafe mm-hmm like what's your", "64:08", "starting point well so for example let's", "64:11", "do quantum mechanics all right so we", "64:13", "want to understand the many-worlds", "64:15", "interpretation of quantum mechanics okay", "64:17", "so you say that the world really is some", "64:20", "quantum wave function but you and I", "64:22", "observe things like space", "64:25", "and tables and stuff like that right so", "64:28", "what does that mean what what does it", "64:30", "mean to say there's a there's a table", "64:32", "lurking in the wave function of the", "64:33", "universe or there's you know stars and", "64:35", "galaxies so that means that there's some", "64:37", "way of writing the wave function of the", "64:40", "universe that is sort of here's a table", "64:42", "here's the rest of the universe so I", "64:44", "might write down on a piece of paper", "64:46", "well here is a toy model like a simple", "64:49", "representation of the wave function of", "64:50", "the universe that includes one piece and", "64:52", "another piece and they're interacting", "64:53", "with each other how would I know that", "64:56", "that was table like how would I know in", "64:58", "tables are not really what we care about", "65:00", "but why is space three-dimensional right", "65:02", "this is the kind of question we would", "65:04", "worry about so what would a wave", "65:06", "function look like that represented", "65:07", "three dimensional space is that natural", "65:09", "could I poke at it and kind of make a", "65:11", "prediction for what the early universe", "65:13", "was like on the basis of that things", "65:14", "like that whoa so now like when you do", "65:18", "calculations like say if you were doing", "65:20", "in calcio do you study black holes at", "65:22", "all a little bit yeah a little bit yeah", "65:23", "writing paper right now Michael are you", "65:25", "yeah and what are you writing about like", "65:27", "what specifically well there's this", "65:28", "famous problem in black holes that they", "65:30", "evaporate right they give off radiation", "65:31", "Stephen Hawking back in the 1970s said", "65:34", "that black holes weren't completely", "65:36", "black right there's there's quantum", "65:38", "mechanics as they will gradually", "65:39", "evaporate away so that's fine we think", "65:43", "we understand that what does that mean", "65:44", "what does it mean yes I mean they're not", "65:47", "completely but like what it is but a", "65:49", "black hole is essentially like the event", "65:51", "horizon is this tiny infinitely dense", "65:54", "area right and it's sucking in the", "65:56", "galaxies around it and like supermassive", "66:00", "black holes is that does this still", "66:02", "believe that they're in the center of", "66:04", "every galaxy and they represent one-half", "66:06", "of 1% of the mass of the galaxy itself", "66:08", "tiny fraction right so the larger the", "66:10", "galaxy the larger the supermassive black", "66:12", "hole basically yeah that's right so what", "66:14", "is it so what is the black what is it", "66:17", "yeah a black hole is a region of space", "66:19", "it's a region of space where the", "66:21", "gravitational field is so strong that", "66:23", "you can never leave that region of space", "66:25", "to go to the outside world Jesus that's", "66:27", "what it is", "66:29", "but so Stephen Hawking so that's that", "66:32", "there's there's different sort of levels", "66:33", "of sophistication and thinking about", "66:35", "what black holes are so one level is to", "66:39", "forget about quantum mechanics entirely", "66:40", "use general relativity Einstein's theory", "66:43", "of gravity that he invented a hundred", "66:45", "years ago 1916 and he says what is", "66:49", "gravity", "66:49", "it's space-time curving on itself that's", "66:52", "what gravity is and he has equations to", "66:54", "tell you how much these time curves etc", "66:56", "so we can describe black holes in in", "66:58", "those terms and one of the things you", "67:00", "find is that black holes only ever", "67:01", "increase in size you're right they can", "67:03", "suck things in but they never shrink", "67:05", "because they just suck things in right", "67:07", "but then in the 1970s Stephen Hawking", "67:09", "says well what if we take into account", "67:12", "quantum mechanics there are you know", "67:15", "there's these clouds of probability all", "67:16", "around the black hole and he says if I", "67:18", "look at a black hole does it look", "67:20", "completely black and the answer is to", "67:22", "his great surprise and still to ours", "67:25", "no it doesn't look completely black even", "67:28", "black holes when you look at them will", "67:30", "be seen to gradually emit photons to", "67:34", "emit radiation very very very slowly and", "67:37", "how are you looking at them like what", "67:39", "method are using this is a thought", "67:41", "experiment we've never seen this in the", "67:44", "real world the actual black holes we", "67:46", "know about the mid radiation so slowly", "67:49", "there's no practical way to actually", "67:50", "observe it so this is entirely", "67:52", "theoretical right now so but if it is", "67:55", "entirely theoretical how do you measure", "67:58", "that they're not entirely black we", "68:01", "haven't been able to do that we predict", "68:03", "that they're not entirely black but", "68:04", "we've never verified that prediction yet", "68:05", "you're freaking me out man there's a lot", "68:07", "a lot of physics is making predictions", "68:09", "that we can't get past but someday we're", "68:11", "hoping but why even assume that I mean I", "68:13", "don't understand what the the motivation", "68:15", "for assuming that they're not entirely", "68:17", "black it's not an assumption it is if", "68:19", "you believe what we think is already", "68:20", "true about general relativity the", "68:23", "curvature of space-time and quantum", "68:25", "mechanics then Hawking says it follows", "68:29", "from those assumptions that black holes", "68:30", "are not completely black they give off", "68:32", "radiation mmm okay now what about the", "68:36", "theory and then I've heard this fairly", "68:39", "recently that there is a", "68:42", "potentially another universe inside of a", "68:45", "black hole that as you go into a black", "68:47", "hole you may in fact be going into", "68:49", "another universe that's filled with", "68:52", "hundreds of millions of galaxies that", "68:54", "have hundreds of millions of black holes", "68:56", "the center and perhaps hundreds of", "68:58", "millions of universes inside of them", "68:59", "right it's possible which again as I", "69:03", "said earlier is what you should always", "69:04", "say in these circumstances there's no", "69:06", "reason to think it's likely but it's", "69:09", "certainly conceivable that that happens", "69:11", "by the way the journey would not be", "69:13", "pain-free when you were inside the black", "69:15", "hole you would die okay you'd be very", "69:17", "very the technical term is spaghettified", "69:20", "right because the gravitational pull is", "69:23", "much stronger at your head than at your", "69:24", "feet as you're diving headfirst so you", "69:26", "would be pulled into a very thin", "69:28", "non-living which cannonballs it yeah", "69:30", "that doesn't help doesn't help did you", "69:32", "go crazy when you saw that movie", "69:33", "interstellar we I mean you know there's", "69:36", "a weird thing I actually know a lot", "69:38", "about the backstory there because Kip", "69:40", "Thorne who was who invented the idea", "69:42", "what is it my colleague II Caltech so if", "69:45", "you know remember the movie or the book", "69:47", "contact calls a short movie so Carl", "69:51", "Sagan was a brilliant guy but he was not", "69:53", "a physicist he was a planetary scientist", "69:55", "he studied life on other planets and", "69:56", "things so in his novel he had this idea", "69:59", "he wanted his heroine le to get across", "70:02", "the galaxy very very quickly faster than", "70:04", "the speed of light and so in the first", "70:06", "draft he said she falls into a black", "70:08", "hole and then she gets spit out", "70:09", "somewhere else in the galaxy and he knew", "70:11", "that that couldn't that's not exactly", "70:12", "right that didn't sound right", "70:14", "so he called up his friend Kip Thorne", "70:16", "who's a very famous physicist at Caltech", "70:18", "who is by the way will be winning the", "70:20", "Nobel Prize in a couple months in", "70:23", "October is it rigged no but it's just", "70:25", "such an obvious choice for because he", "70:27", "also helped invent LIGO when they", "70:29", "discovered gravitational waves and", "70:30", "that's definitely gonna be worthy of a", "70:32", "Nobel I go like oh yes what's that do", "70:35", "you remember hearing the gravitational", "70:37", "waves were detected a year year and half", "70:39", "yes", "70:39", "so LIGO is the observatory that did that", "70:41", "oh okay so that's his the observatory so", "70:45", "he was one of the other one of the", "70:46", "moving pieces moving forces behind that", "70:49", "so gravitational waves were some", "70:51", "theoretical thing yes", "70:54", "that's right big announcement about the", "70:56", "new gravitational waves from LIGO might", "70:58", "be coming yet that's Argos 24th pretty", "71:01", "recently our goes another I know has", "71:05", "been what is it tell us can tell us I", "71:08", "can tell you because it's on the", "71:09", "Internet you can see I don't want to", "71:11", "tell you because it's say I should let", "71:12", "LIGO tell you and this is a rumor but I", "71:15", "would just say stay tuned when wha when", "71:18", "we saw last year the announcement was", "71:21", "black holes were spiraling into each", "71:24", "other and giving off gravitational waves", "71:27", "and that's what we saw okay that's that", "71:30", "was the source of the gravitational", "71:31", "waves that we saw this news story is", "71:34", "about neutron stars spiraling into each", "71:37", "other or spiraling into something uneven", "71:38", "know the details it is the rumor but", "71:40", "it's a different source for the", "71:41", "gravitational waves than we had before", "71:43", "here it is beyond black holes could LIGO", "71:45", "have detected imaging neutron stars for", "71:48", "the first time now merging meaning I'd", "71:50", "like this infinitely slow pace that", "71:52", "you're sort of measuring nobody's very", "71:54", "fast very fast yeah take seconds once", "71:57", "once they're together yeah once they're", "71:59", "very very close and emitting", "72:00", "gravitational waves you can observe Wow", "72:02", "and the exciting thing is it's okay once", "72:05", "black holes can merge why not neutron", "72:07", "stars the difference is that black holes", "72:09", "despite everything I just said them", "72:11", "about them not being completely black", "72:12", "are pretty darn black so you see", "72:15", "gravitational waves but you don't see", "72:17", "them in your regular telescopes with", "72:19", "neutron stars there's a chance you can", "72:20", "just see them as well as detect the", "72:22", "gravitational wave now neutron stars now", "72:25", "when they're doing this you know we're", "72:27", "talking about like how far away are we", "72:29", "observing this oh I don't know usually", "72:32", "millions of light years Wow so anything", "72:35", "you're observing happen millions of", "72:37", "years ago yeah that's right yes that's", "72:41", "the that's one of the bigger mind Fox", "72:44", "it's hard to get your head around when", "72:46", "you look it up in the sky and you're", "72:47", "seeing something that's a million light", "72:49", "years away yeah when you're looking", "72:51", "through a telescope you're seeing", "72:52", "something that might not even be there", "72:54", "anymore", "72:54", "oh yeah well in this case you know it's", "72:56", "not because it what gave off one of the", "72:57", "biggest explosions in the universe and", "72:59", "that's what you're seeing the aftermath", "73:00", "of yeah those neutron stars are no", "73:03", "longer around if they're if they're then", "73:04", "I might have made a black hole there", "73:06", "might be some black hole", "73:07", "Wow if we observed the birth of a black", "73:11", "hole for I don't think we've observed", "73:13", "the birth we've observed one big black", "73:16", "hole being made out of two smaller ones", "73:17", "that's what that's what LIGO song right", "73:20", "they actually observed it taking place", "73:21", "depends any definition of observed we", "73:23", "know then it happened yeah um the", "73:25", "gravitational wave signature that we", "73:27", "observed okay so you you have a", "73:29", "signature that is undeniably the", "73:32", "evidence of this now this one I don't", "73:35", "know the details here with the neutron", "73:36", "stars but there they might be able to", "73:38", "say there is now black hole left behind", "73:40", "I don't know I'd be surprised that", "73:41", "sounds very precise you know very", "73:44", "unrealistic but that's the kind of thing", "73:45", "we would hope to be able to say someday", "73:47", "I've seen that on drugs this thing yeah", "73:49", "are you showing you take DMT you can see", "73:51", "that so what is this this is the", "73:54", "animated depiction of these two black", "73:57", "holes spiraling into each other and", "73:59", "begins another one of my Caltech", "74:02", "colleague that dude needs to get outside", "74:03", "looks like he's just been buried in", "74:05", "books then we wouldn't let him outside a", "74:09", "little bit", "74:10", "stay inside come out a little bit buddy", "74:11", "yeah some pictures don't make themselves", "74:16", "I'm sure know them sure they delegate", "74:18", "he's got this fish on the wall he's", "74:20", "losing his mind he's drawing fish when", "74:24", "like when you try to make these visual", "74:28", "representations of something that is", "74:30", "like essentially your your your only", "74:35", "interpreting you're getting the", "74:36", "gravitational wave you're getting the", "74:38", "information that data and then you try", "74:41", "to make a visual representation of this", "74:43", "thing that's for the general public", "74:44", "right it's not basically really for you", "74:46", "guys that's right so if you could also", "74:48", "though see the event happen using", "74:51", "visible light or using your regular", "74:52", "telescopes that would give you enormous", "74:54", "Lemoore information so that's always a", "74:55", "good thing to aim for so as they do like", "74:57", "this this array that they're putting", "75:00", "together in Chile and all these", "75:01", "different new more advanced super", "75:04", "telescope arrays they're trying to get", "75:06", "more and more actual visual information", "75:10", "yeah that people could see this stuff or", "75:12", "something something yeah I mean there's", "75:14", "a there's a lot it's much easier to", "75:17", "detect light than it is to detect", "75:19", "gravitational waves", "75:20", "is the sound this is a actually", "75:23", "gravitational wave from the early", "75:26", "detection the first ones we got last", "75:28", "year so this is like Oh", "75:30", "Hanford on top and LIGO Livingston", "75:33", "that's the actual sound there is no", "75:35", "actual sound they translate it into", "75:38", "sound it's a gravitational wave that", "75:40", "they said well what if it were sound", "75:42", "waves that are gravitationally didn't", "75:44", "that would sound so confusing I was", "75:49", "watching a documentary and they were", "75:51", "talking about hyper Nova's and they were", "75:53", "talking about the initial discovery of", "75:54", "hyper Nova's that they detected this", "75:56", "gamma radiation these bursts in the sky", "75:58", "and they originally had one working", "76:02", "theory that there was some sort of an", "76:03", "alien war going on yes right oh yeah", "76:06", "that like astronomers bless their hearts", "76:09", "they you know are happy to at least", "76:11", "contemplate some of the more way-out", "76:13", "speculations like when pulsars which are", "76:16", "just spinning neutron stars when they", "76:18", "were first detected they were called LG", "76:20", "m/s for little green men because they", "76:22", "were these very very regular pulses and", "76:24", "people said what could it be", "76:26", "right it was not like one of those", "76:29", "planets that we've observed recently had", "76:32", "something that was orbiting it and they", "76:34", "were trying to figure out if it was some", "76:36", "space yet enormous space station that", "76:38", "was causing this well there was yeah", "76:40", "there's a something that got labeled the", "76:42", "alien mega-structure yes that's which is", "76:44", "basically like something that is bigger", "76:46", "and colder than you would expect but", "76:48", "maybe if it were you know some structure", "76:50", "surrounding a star that's what it would", "76:52", "look like yeah I wouldn't bet on that I", "76:54", "don't think that's a reasonable whenever", "76:57", "I read something like that I'm like oh", "76:59", "they just want funding they just want to", "77:01", "get people excited you don't get any", "77:02", "funding for that no anti get funding for", "77:04", "that for really for an alien biggest", "77:06", "star yeah because the people give you", "77:08", "funding or your fellow scientist you", "77:09", "think is taking cheap thrills", "77:11", "rather than being serious so what you do", "77:13", "is you get hits for your website and you", "77:15", "might not necessarily like when you're", "77:17", "going to some of these websites that", "77:19", "science websites for the most part have", "77:22", "really straightforward sort of titles to", "77:25", "their articles but occasionally you get", "77:27", "a little click Beatty oh yeah with some", "77:29", "stomach screaming they're having beings", "77:31", "they're like little more you know a", "77:33", "little likes on there juice it up", "77:35", "get people excited yeah so when they", "77:41", "first initially discovered this these", "77:44", "gamma-ray bursts and they thought there", "77:46", "was some sort of an alien war going", "77:49", "going on in space I mean there's mean so", "77:54", "far nothing right so far there's no", "77:56", "detectable evidence whatsoever of", "77:59", "anything out there other than us that's", "78:01", "right but when the thing if there is I", "78:03", "mean when and if right if the thing", "78:05", "comes if one day we get some sort of", "78:08", "undeniable signal whatever it is or we", "78:11", "see something all right how does that", "78:13", "get processed like do you have to go", "78:16", "like straight to President Trump and go", "78:18", "hey man I would not do that who is like", "78:23", "say if it was one of your colleagues ya", "78:26", "know there is a procedure it's not even", "78:28", "very well publicized as far as I I don't", "78:31", "know is it a legal procedure for like a", "78:33", "prat that has more self-appointed you", "78:37", "know people have said all right we are", "78:38", "the alien detection network they might", "78:40", "be able to keep your mouth shut if you", "78:42", "like oh yeah yeah well I think it's I", "78:45", "think that we're not very realistic", "78:47", "about these I think that it could happen", "78:50", "but we're just like with quantum", "78:53", "mechanics or artificial intelligence or", "78:55", "whatever we tend to put everything in", "78:58", "the frame of what we're immediately used", "79:00", "to right so we can remount radio signals", "79:03", "into space we're really good at that", "79:05", "right so we tend to think that aliens", "79:07", "will either be discovered or actually", "79:10", "contact us by beaming radio signals on", "79:12", "us", "79:12", "right but that's a horrendously wasteful", "79:15", "way to do interstellar communication", "79:17", "right for one thing radio waves move at", "79:21", "the speed of light so imagine you're a", "79:23", "thousand light years away you have no", "79:25", "idea what's going on on earth but you", "79:27", "say well there's a promising location", "79:30", "for life to arise I know what I'll do", "79:31", "I'll beam a signal at them well how long", "79:34", "did a beam in you're gonna turn the", "79:35", "telescope on for a month then in the", "79:37", "whole history of humankind they'd better", "79:39", "be listening at the exact right month", "79:41", "otherwise they're not going to hear it", "79:42", "it's actually way more efficient to send", "79:45", "a spacecraft even though it's much", "79:47", "slower that's okay you know", "79:48", "anytime send a spacecraft and park it in", "79:51", "the system that you want to know about", "79:53", "and then wait for life to arise in that", "79:55", "system so honestly if we're gonna detect", "79:58", "evidence for aliens it's much more", "80:00", "likely we're gonna find a monolith on", "80:02", "the moon or something like that then", "80:03", "we're gonna hear him in our telescopes a", "80:05", "monolith on the moon wasn't it 2001", "80:09", "right but wasn't it something that uh", "80:11", "one of the astronauts said they saw", "80:13", "something up there some of those", "80:15", "astronauts have lost their mind as they", "80:17", "got older and I've always wondered like", "80:18", "Edgar Mitchell's the big one he's the", "80:21", "one who says he's seen some things and", "80:23", "the aliens are real and I always wonder", "80:26", "are those guys getting crazy as they get", "80:29", "older or they're going look I gotta get", "80:30", "some money I need some I need some", "80:32", "attention what's the best way to do it", "80:34", "it happened to that alien market that", "80:36", "alien market is a big market they could", "80:38", "be perfectly sincere but look the what", "80:40", "you want when you pick who's gonna be an", "80:42", "astronaut is someone who can fly the", "80:43", "spacecraft Bank right right they don't", "80:45", "need to have good judgment about whether", "80:46", "or not there are aliens up there right", "80:47", "not what you're going for right you they", "80:50", "just need to have an understanding of", "80:51", "what the task is and how they're gonna", "80:53", "perform it yeah yeah Edgar Mitchell was", "80:56", "uh he I think he might have passed away", "80:58", "recently did he pass away but he's one", "81:01", "of those guys that people always bring", "81:02", "up what I I'm not a believer necessarily", "81:05", "in not that I'm not a believer in alien", "81:08", "life but I'm not believer in any of the", "81:11", "people that say they've seen aliens or", "81:13", "you know I've just I did a show for", "81:15", "sci-fi and one of the episodes we did we", "81:18", "spent weeks talking to people that are", "81:21", "UFO researchers and studying the", "81:23", "air-quote evidence right and there's", "81:26", "nothing there yeah like look be a good", "81:28", "Bayesian if someone sees some flashing", "81:30", "lights in the sky what is more likely a", "81:32", "lien civilization door they're not", "81:34", "accurately reporting what they saw", "81:35", "like eyewitness testimony is terrible", "81:37", "terrible turns out and especially in", "81:39", "these weird cases yeah it's just very", "81:41", "very dismissible so right and you want", "81:44", "to keep an open mind because if there", "81:46", "was a unique event where an alien", "81:48", "spacecraft did enter our atmosphere and", "81:51", "observe us and then take off it would be", "81:54", "quite fascinating", "81:55", "if you could actually get a good read on", "81:56", "someone maybe hugely important to the", "82:00", "history of life on Earth right", "82:02", "human history if we've won if and when", "82:04", "we finally discover intelligent life out", "82:06", "there somewhere else that'll be one of", "82:08", "the most important events in our history", "82:09", "the idea that it's a you know a 20 foot", "82:13", "long flying saucer that comes and visits", "82:15", "you in Wyoming is not very possible well", "82:19", "also the idea of physical beings are", "82:21", "onboard this thing seems", "82:23", "counterintuitive why would they do that", "82:26", "yeah we don't have to do that anymore", "82:27", "like we send the Mars rover up there we", "82:29", "get amazing footage it stays up there", "82:31", "forever it doesn't need food exactly", "82:33", "yeah it's so that's what they do they'll", "82:34", "send a rover here yeah not not a either", "82:36", "a person or radio wave that's what I", "82:39", "would imagine I would imagine would be", "82:40", "obviously I don't know what the fuck I'm", "82:43", "talking so forgetting that right now I", "82:46", "would just assume that it would be some", "82:48", "super complicated drone yeah", "82:50", "and that yeah they would try to just", "82:53", "take data observe maybe get some sort of", "82:56", "a visual understanding and obviously", "82:57", "with the kind of telescopes that we have", "83:00", "like the Himawari 8 when they would", "83:03", "22,000 miles out we take these", "83:04", "incredible high-resolution detailed", "83:07", "video and photographs of the earth", "83:09", "itself", "83:10", "what kind of shit to the aliens out they", "83:12", "probably don't need to get anywhere near", "83:13", "us right yeah", "83:15", "imagine the weird thing is they're you", "83:18", "know the Fermi paradox they should be", "83:20", "here already right like the solar system", "83:22", "should be buzzing with these drones and", "83:25", "either", "83:27", "well almost certainly it's not because", "83:29", "it's not clear why they would try to", "83:31", "hide from us really and if they don't", "83:32", "try to hide they'd be easily noticeable", "83:34", "so there's something we don't understand", "83:37", "about life in the universe either it's", "83:39", "much more rare than we might guess or", "83:42", "for some reason it's not very gregarious", "83:43", "it doesn't go and visit the rest of the", "83:46", "stars in the galaxy hmm my thought was", "83:49", "and this is a obviously a very", "83:52", "controversial thought but but no one", "83:54", "wants to think that we're the first", "83:56", "right that's like well if there's us", "83:58", "then there's probably more right maybe", "84:01", "right but maybe it has to happen once", "84:05", "some it has to happen for the first time", "84:08", "somewhere yeah right like this like a", "84:10", "single-celled organism had to become a", "84:13", "multi-celled organism it had to take", "84:15", "place through me", "84:16", "and it had to take place at one point in", "84:18", "time well that time on this planet at", "84:20", "least it was the first time one yeah at", "84:23", "one point milk billions of years ago", "84:25", "right why do we this is all we know that", "84:29", "we are the only thing that's ever done", "84:30", "that as far as we know here so why would", "84:33", "we assume that anything else we might be", "84:36", "the tip of the spear it's completely", "84:37", "possible I think and it's also possible", "84:39", "that we're that life happens all the", "84:42", "time but it never becomes multicellular", "84:44", "or intelligent mmm or gums intelligent", "84:46", "but never build spaceships there's many", "84:48", "many ways it could happen but yes we", "84:50", "could be in the entire observable", "84:51", "universe the only space Shipbuilding", "84:53", "species right now well we also have this", "84:55", "weird way of defining intelligence by", "84:57", "the ability to change your atmosphere or", "85:00", "your environment or your to build things", "85:03", "like that's what we think of as", "85:04", "intelligent whereas dolphins are", "85:06", "obviously extremely intelligent but they", "85:08", "don't really impact their environment", "85:10", "much at all other than biological life", "85:12", "like eating things yes and waste and", "85:14", "things along those lines but they don't", "85:15", "build structures they don't they don't", "85:17", "keep records and we live in a weird", "85:20", "planet that is roughly you know a", "85:23", "comparable proportion of land to ocean", "85:25", "right be very easy to imagine planets", "85:28", "that were all ocean mm-hmm that that the", "85:30", "dolphins were the apex predators now", "85:32", "yeah right and so he's got really", "85:35", "spaceships really good at eating fish", "85:37", "yeah yeah they played games and whistled", "85:39", "songs and that was great", "85:40", "yeah well also the idea that life only", "85:43", "has to exist in this Goldilocks zone has", "85:46", "always been weird to me oh yeah you know", "85:48", "very strange also I don't know one that", "85:50", "we're already finding exceptions to that", "85:52", "right like even here in the solar system", "85:54", "you wouldn't necessarily look to earth", "85:56", "first if you didn't already know the", "85:59", "moons of Jupiter and Saturn are very", "86:01", "plausible places to look for the", "86:03", "beginning of life you know they're", "86:04", "outside the Goldilocks zone because it's", "86:05", "just different conditions so I think we", "86:06", "should be very very open-minded about", "86:08", "the conditions around other stars where", "86:11", "life could form yeah I mean we find", "86:12", "weird life at the bottom of oceans and", "86:15", "volcanic vents it's insanely hot and", "86:18", "they find these these life-forms that", "86:21", "are able to thrive", "86:22", "yeah in those conditions that would kill", "86:24", "almost everything else yeah yeah and", "86:26", "part of that is you know it's I think", "86:28", "that the response to that would be", "86:29", "well life started in fairly benign", "86:33", "conditions and then evolved to survive", "86:35", "in these harsher conditions but I just", "86:37", "think that our ability to understand", "86:38", "chemistry and biology is not that good", "86:40", "especially hypothetical speculative", "86:42", "chemistry and biology which are very", "86:44", "humble about saying how life needs to be", "86:46", "on other planets right we always assume", "86:48", "that it has to have water and then", "86:50", "asking a carbon-based and and maybe", "86:52", "that's right but we can't say that we", "86:53", "know right did you ever go through a", "86:55", "period in life where you were obsessed", "86:57", "or fascinated by aliens yeah when I was", "87:00", "a kid I certainly not only aliens but", "87:03", "psychic powers and and all that stuff I", "87:06", "was very you know interested in all the", "87:09", "cool stuff and I became more and more", "87:11", "scientific as I aged yeah those are", "87:14", "weird things that are somehow or another", "87:16", "linked together because they're I don't", "87:19", "want to be mean and saying this but", "87:20", "they're bullshit you know like were", "87:23", "psychic powers or aliens and when you", "87:25", "bring up the fact that it's very likely", "87:27", "these things are bullshit people get", "87:29", "very upset like you're taking away their", "87:31", "Santa Claus yeah you know I don't know", "87:34", "there's a video I saw literally this", "87:36", "morning on the web of the these people", "87:39", "stood outside a little Mart on the", "87:43", "corner of a street in New York where", "87:45", "people were buying Powerball tickets", "87:47", "okay so the people buy Powerball tickets", "87:49", "and it's like 10 bucks and they come out", "87:51", "and they were offered can i buy your", "87:54", "Powerball ticket from you for $20 for", "87:57", "twice what you paid for it and 11 out of", "87:59", "the 14 people that said no I'm holding", "88:01", "onto my ticket right because they", "88:02", "thought that this ticket was the winner", "88:04", "right and they're like this is 700", "88:07", "million dollars that I'd be giving you", "88:08", "for $20 right with no rational", "88:11", "justification but they you know I think", "88:13", "it's and it's in some sense innocent if", "88:16", "you just okay your wishful thinking", "88:18", "about your own little ticket that's fine", "88:19", "but it leads us to be not completely", "88:21", "rational when planning our futures yeah", "88:23", "I'm with the people that won't take the", "88:25", "20 gotta roll it come on I can go in and", "88:28", "buy two more tickets", "88:29", "yeah but the twenty would just be twenty", "88:31", "it would just be twenty dollars no you", "88:33", "can right but you might have in your", "88:36", "possession you might the ticket or it", "88:38", "might be the next one but what if you", "88:39", "give it to them you give them the ticket", "88:42", "you get the twenty you go buy some", "88:43", "useless tickets and turns out the ticket", "88:44", "you gave them was 700 million bucks you", "88:46", "gotta jump off a roof and what if the", "88:48", "one you buy is the one the one the way", "88:51", "you're a glass-half-full kinda guy", "88:53", "aren't you the probabilities work out", "88:55", "you know it doesn't really matter you", "88:57", "don't know what the numbers gonna be", "88:58", "right but that's the randomness of it", "89:00", "all is what gets people like panicky", "89:02", "right like what if what is that but yeah", "89:04", "it could be I mean the the best way to", "89:07", "you know calibrate your odds of winning", "89:10", "the Powerball or saying you know just", "89:12", "play the numbers one two three four five", "89:14", "six and people go like well that's never", "89:16", "gonna come up right like actually the", "89:18", "probability of that kind of it's the", "89:19", "same as any other one that you're gonna", "89:21", "pick huh", "89:23", "doesn't matter what it was yeah it's", "89:25", "just random now have you ever read", "89:28", "anything compelling at all that leads", "89:31", "you to think that maybe somebody might", "89:34", "have observed something that could", "89:35", "potentially have been something from", "89:37", "another planet or some sort of an no I", "89:39", "don't think so", "89:40", "I mean I think that astronomers do have", "89:43", "a set of things that they don't", "89:44", "understand very well the most recent", "89:46", "example of these things called fast", "89:47", "radio bursts which are a little bit", "89:48", "different than the gamma bursts gamma", "89:50", "ray bursts but you know as always the", "89:53", "more we think about it the more we say", "89:54", "oh actually I can come up with a", "89:56", "perfectly plausible explanation for that", "89:57", "and then nothing to do with aliens going", "90:00", "back to this sort of uploading", "90:01", "consciousness thing there's a very real", "90:03", "possibility that once civilizations or", "90:05", "intelligent species become sufficiently", "90:07", "advanced they upload themselves and they", "90:10", "realize there's not really any", "90:11", "motivation to go exploring in the", "90:12", "universe and maybe die anymore yeah", "90:14", "that's what my thought would be that", "90:16", "once civilizations get sufficiently", "90:19", "advanced they would go virtual ya figure", "90:22", "out some way to create these artificial", "90:25", "universes to travel into that are", "90:26", "probably just as complex if not more I", "90:30", "think we have every right to imagine", "90:32", "that give you know so little about what", "90:33", "it would be about right now yeah well if", "90:35", "we can create artificial intelligence -", "90:37", "that's the what's very bizarre it's like", "90:39", "if we can create artificial intelligence", "90:41", "and somehow or another corral it into", "90:43", "existing only in this virtual world that", "90:47", "we've created and then inside this", "90:49", "virtual world you're interacting with", "90:51", "these artificially intelligent creatures", "90:53", "that are disembodied right and then in", "90:54", "this world you would give them some sort", "90:56", "of a body", "90:57", "and you would interact with them I think", "90:59", "that again the thing that we under", "91:01", "appreciate about that is what is the", "91:03", "motivation that these artificially", "91:05", "intelligent entities would have human", "91:08", "beings like it or not we get hungry we", "91:11", "want to have sex we wouldn't have power", "91:13", "or whatever right but like if you're", "91:14", "just a virtual being an environment", "91:16", "without these energetic constraints or", "91:19", "need to eat and sleep and so forth why", "91:22", "do you do anything at all I don't know I", "91:24", "mean why would I have no idea what the", "91:25", "psychology would be like for something", "91:27", "like that did you see ex machina I did", "91:30", "not how dare you that's an amazing movie", "91:33", "I saw it twice I actually I think I saw", "91:36", "three times it's really good I mean it", "91:38", "is a very balanced take on potential", "91:42", "artificial intelligence and I on someone", "91:44", "making it I should see really well-made", "91:46", "movie but you see the store - I don't", "91:50", "want to give away too much of it but you", "91:51", "see the struggle in these things as this", "91:54", "guy is interacting with these things and", "91:56", "you see the struggle as they're trying", "91:59", "to interpret what they are like versus", "92:03", "what he is but they are in bodies right", "92:05", "there like that yes yeah yeah got a", "92:08", "wonder like what I mean Elon Musk is", "92:11", "terrified of this shit right I mean he", "92:12", "said that we might be summoning the", "92:14", "demon that's his exact quote yeah yeah", "92:16", "and I get trouble I tend to agree with", "92:19", "him and again I get in trouble on", "92:21", "Twitter for saying that I agree with him", "92:23", "but because people who are actually", "92:25", "doing artificial intelligence have this", "92:27", "very real appreciation for how far away", "92:30", "we are from something that you would", "92:31", "classify as intelligent in any real", "92:33", "sense and so therefore from their", "92:35", "day-to-day perspective to worry about", "92:38", "super intelligent AI is taking over the", "92:40", "world is laughable but my argument I", "92:44", "think Ilan's is that yeah but what does", "92:46", "the percentage chance have to be that", "92:48", "this is gonna happen before you start", "92:49", "worrying about it if the consequence is", "92:51", "really the ruination of the world right", "92:53", "right there are only so many things that", "92:56", "we do for which the worst-case scenario", "92:58", "is quite that bad that's what makes it a", "93:01", "special circumstance and it might be", "93:04", "very very unlikely but are you willing", "93:06", "to say like okay 1% chance that all", "93:08", "human beings", "93:09", "destroy", "93:10", "don't think that's that's actually the", "93:12", "worry but we should just do our due", "93:14", "diligence right we should think about", "93:16", "what the possibilities are we should", "93:18", "plan for them probably no big deal when", "93:21", "I said this on Twitter people knowing", "93:22", "that was a physicist were like well what", "93:25", "did you think about people who were", "93:26", "worried that the Large Hadron Collider", "93:27", "was gonna destroy the world right I said", "93:29", "well what do you mean physicists did", "93:31", "many many studies checking to see", "93:33", "whether or not it would destroy the", "93:34", "world we don't want to be destroyed any", "93:35", "more than anybody else and so I think", "93:36", "that's a very sensible thing to do for", "93:38", "artificial intelligence also yeah I", "93:40", "agree just when you see articles like", "93:43", "did you see the recent article or the", "93:45", "Google AI that they had to shut down", "93:46", "because they were starting to", "93:48", "communicate with each other and the", "93:50", "language they invented that language was", "93:53", "not very convincing if you saw it", "93:55", "printed out I'm sure but to me that's", "93:57", "that's like a scene in a horror movie", "93:59", "where like and then you go to 10 you", "94:02", "know blank screen 10 years later and you", "94:04", "know we're all dressed up like Mad Max", "94:06", "with fucking you know bandanas over our", "94:08", "face and we're running from Terminator", "94:10", "bots well I think that's the thing again", "94:12", "and again we're coming to this theme", "94:13", "that our imaginations are not quite up", "94:15", "to the task because their imaginations", "94:17", "about super intelligent AI or something", "94:19", "like that something you know", "94:20", "Frankenstein ask just in robots or", "94:22", "something like how do Asimov but that I", "94:25", "think much more realistic worry are", "94:28", "things like currently existing neural", "94:31", "networks and deep learning algorithms so", "94:33", "basically there's all sorts of problems", "94:35", "like pattern recognition facial", "94:38", "recognition right we are very very bad", "94:40", "at sitting down and writing a program", "94:42", "that recognizes faces human beings are", "94:44", "not very good at figuring out how to do", "94:46", "that but we have ways of building", "94:49", "programs that can teach themselves to", "94:52", "recognize faces and they're amazingly", "94:54", "good so we have programs like when you", "94:56", "go onto Google or your iTunes or", "94:58", "whatever and you know your iPhoto is", "95:01", "recognizing your face there is some", "95:04", "neural net that is doing that and there", "95:05", "is no human being alive that understands", "95:07", "what it's doing", "95:08", "all we know is that it's getting the", "95:10", "right answer okay and that can be that", "95:13", "kind of logic can go very very far and", "95:16", "so it I'm not worried about like a robot", "95:19", "like Ultron taking over I'm worried", "95:21", "about our all of our infrastructure", "95:24", "being", "95:24", "run by programs that no human being", "95:26", "understands whoa", "95:28", "that's something I hadn't even", "95:30", "considered but yeah that's a real issue", "95:32", "yeah that's a real issue right that's an", "95:35", "actual real thing", "95:36", "I've always wondered whether or not what", "95:39", "human beings are doing with our insane", "95:41", "lust to innovate and to constantly", "95:43", "create new and more spectacular things", "95:45", "and to always look for the next version", "95:48", "of something we're not satisfied with", "95:50", "the iPhone 6 we want the iPhone 7 what", "95:52", "sounds fun with that when's the 8 come", "95:54", "out yeah we always we have this intense", "95:56", "desire for better things we don't I mean", "95:58", "unless you're a classic-car", "96:00", "advocate or a devotee really what you", "96:03", "want is like oh this new car stops", "96:05", "faster it handles better it accelerates", "96:08", "quicker we always want things to", "96:10", "constantly improve and I've always and", "96:12", "when you look at human beings like if", "96:15", "you looked at us objectively that's one", "96:16", "of the main things that we do we produce", "96:19", "better technology better objects better", "96:23", "engineering it's like constantly", "96:25", "improving and accelerating and then", "96:27", "there's this potential artificial", "96:29", "intelligence thing I've always wondered", "96:31", "if that's really what our focus or what", "96:33", "our purpose is on this planet that we're", "96:35", "like some sort of an electronic", "96:37", "caterpillar it's going to become a", "96:40", "butterfly that yeah that what we", "96:41", "recognize in some sort of a weird way or", "96:44", "nature recognizes the biological", "96:46", "limitations of flesh and tissue and that", "96:49", "it can advance far better with something", "96:52", "that we create so that we don't even", "96:54", "realize what we're doing by making this", "96:55", "cocoon that we're just like building it", "96:58", "out building it up we're not even", "96:59", "thinking about what we're doing we just", "97:00", "I want a new laptop whoo and by buying", "97:02", "this and by this materialism that we all", "97:05", "have right we have this this people have", "97:07", "this innate sort of desire for new and", "97:10", "shiny objects that that is fueling this", "97:14", "innovation and that's pushing along this", "97:16", "and that one day we're going to give", "97:18", "birth to this new version of life we can", "97:20", "call it artificial life but it's not", "97:23", "artificial if it's right there it's just", "97:25", "created by human beings which obviously", "97:28", "are created by this intense and very", "97:32", "long evolutionary process this might be", "97:34", "a part of that process yeah so I would I", "97:37", "would", "97:38", "tend to want to remove from that the", "97:40", "sort of anthropomorphic or teleological", "97:43", "aspects of the language like that it's", "97:45", "the purpose or we're meant to be here", "97:46", "but I completely agree with the idea", "97:49", "that there's a threshold that has been", "97:51", "crossed whether you want to say it's the", "97:53", "last 500 years or the last 10,000 years", "97:56", "they're human beings had developed the", "97:58", "ability to do something that has never", "98:00", "been done before and that has this sort", "98:04", "of recursive self reflective thing that", "98:06", "we can build things that can build", "98:08", "things that we can build things that can", "98:09", "learn and we can build things that are", "98:11", "like living things and we are just at", "98:14", "the very very beginning of exploring the", "98:17", "space of what's going to happen because", "98:18", "of that", "98:18", "and the idea that we human beings are", "98:21", "gonna be around 10,000 years to enjoy", "98:24", "the fruits of that I have no idea", "98:27", "whether that's true or not I don't even", "98:28", "know that's bad I mean maybe it'll still", "98:31", "be human beings maybe a hundred years", "98:33", "from now we'll cure death and aging and", "98:36", "we'll stop having kids and the people", "98:38", "who are alive a hundred years from now", "98:39", "will differ in other million years maybe", "98:42", "human beings will just become more and", "98:44", "more melded with artificial things and", "98:47", "they'll have artificial bodies and so", "98:50", "forth or maybe you know one another", "98:53", "under appreciated thing I think is that", "98:54", "at the very very small scale where we do", "98:57", "like nanotechnology and so forth there", "99:00", "is a whole bunch of problems that have", "99:03", "already been solved at that scale namely", "99:05", "biology cells right like cells do many", "99:09", "many things really really well and they", "99:11", "also repair themselves they're much less", "99:13", "brittle than things that we build using", "99:15", "metal okay", "99:16", "so synthetic biology just programming", "99:19", "existing biological organisms or", "99:22", "designing new ones but we would still", "99:23", "recognize them as biological but they", "99:26", "might be very very different than", "99:28", "anything that naturally appeared through", "99:30", "the course of evolution so far that", "99:32", "could be the thing that takes off and a", "99:34", "hundred years from now that's all the", "99:35", "living beings or all the beings with", "99:37", "higher intelligence left on earth I mean", "99:38", "I don't know what the actual thing", "99:41", "that's gonna happen is but what I know", "99:42", "is that the pace of change is just", "99:45", "accelerating we're just at the very", "99:46", "start yeah we really are and it's it's", "99:49", "so what do you ever sit around", "99:51", "and try to extrapolate and try to like", "99:53", "look at where we are now as opposed to", "99:55", "where we were at the turn of the century", "99:56", "and it's lasting on 20th century", "99:59", "yeah and just right thinking like where", "100:01", "is this going I mean this it seems like", "100:04", "any day now some new

"100:16", "like there's a weird fact if you wanted", "100:19", "to make a movie and set it 50 years ago", "100:21", "right so in the 1960s it wouldn't be", "100:24", "that hard to film you know outside and", "100:27", "in certain areas certain suburbs it kind", "100:29", "of looks more or less like a look in the", "100:31", "1950s whereas it's actually would be", "100:33", "harder to make something that was in the", "100:36", "1960s look like it did the 1910s right", "100:39", "there's sort of more obvious visible", "100:41", "change just as cars were different and", "100:43", "so forth but you don't see the sort of", "100:46", "technological change that might be have", "100:48", "a far bigger impact in electronics and", "100:52", "artificial intelligence and so forth", "100:53", "that happened in the last 50 years", "100:54", "so just because there's no visible sign", "100:56", "of the change doesn't mean that the", "100:58", "changes cannot be eventually very",

thought we", "101:09", "were gonna be flying around in space", "101:10", "constantly yeah like the movie alien", "101:13", "what year was that supposed to be I", "101:15", "think that's like the year 2100 or", "101:18", "something like that right not that far", "101:20", "well what we're really good at is taking", "101:22", "things that already exist and", "101:23", "extrapolating them to be faster and", "101:25", "bigger yeah all right so if you can", "101:27", "build an airplane then you can build a", "101:28", "rocket ship arbitrarily fast that's easy", "101:30", "to imagine but things that change", "101:32", "culture like really curing aging that's", "101:36", "hard to imagine what that would be like", "101:38", "it's also greedy because like where we", "101:40", "gonna put all

than a few", "123:53", "months to figure out 5% i think is", "123:55", "pretty healthy yeah I think we're", "123:57", "getting there um what is the the current", "123:59", "theory as to like where it

that we call the weak", "125:28", "nuclear force that could easily be the", "125:30", "dark matter", "125:30", "so that was seemed so natural and simple", "125:33", "and there were many more

the", "127:18", "first evidence well you know it comes in", "127:20", "drips and drabs", "127:21", "my my Caltech predecessor Fritz Zwicky", "127:24", "famous astrophysicist back in the 1930s", "127:27", "pointed out that galaxies were orbiting", "127:30", "each other too fast in what are called", "127:33", "clusters of galaxies you look out there", "127:35", "in the sky you see like these

they're much more massive", "127:52", "than you thought if there's much more", "127:54", "mass in there there's some missing mass", "127:56", "okay but at the time we didn't know it", "127:59", "could just be stars that we didn't see", "128:01", "or gas or dust or whatever it wasn't", "128:03", "really till the 1970s that Vera Rubin", "128:06", "famous astrophysicist looked at how", "128:08",

"128:18", "amount of matter that is inside and she", "128:20", "concluded there's like a lot of dark", "128:22", "matter causing a gravitational pull that", "128:25", "we didn't see but is causing this the", "128:27", "edges of the galaxies to spin a lot", "128:29", "faster than they should be", "128:30", "Wow so that is the reason what is there", "128:33", "is it a possibility that some new",

"128:47", "so there's certainly this idea that is", "128:49", "on the market that because all of our", "128:53", "evidence for dark matter is indirect", "128:55", "because it's through its

different now I would argue", "129:07", "and I think I'm right not everyone", "129:09", "agrees with me sadly but that idea has", "129:12", "basically been killed off by our", "129:14", "observations of the microwave background", "129:17", "radiation you know we are 14 billion", "129:20", "years after the Big Bang there was the", "129:22", "Big Bang was very very hot and dense and", "129:25", "is

enough it became", "129:35", "transparent and then these this these", "129:38", "photons of light just stretched travel", "129:40", "through the universe unimpeded and we", "129:42", "can see that the

"the basic thing is if you if I can just", "130:02", "pull if already and say trust me on this", "130:04", "mmm I was I was totally on board with", "130:07", "the idea that there was something wrong", "130:08", "about gravity that would be very cool", "130:10", "thing if it were true there would be a", "130:11", "big mind-bending discovery but we've", "130:14", "tested that and the microwave

stuff like how does like if", "130:53", "you can't detect it well you know it", "130:56", "exists right you know because of its", "130:57", "effects that's like you don't you can't", "130:59", "like point to it like you", "131:01", "point to the Sun right so you need some", "131:03", "tracers you need something that tells", "131:04", "you that dark matter is influencing the", "131:06", "motion of

was it a recent yeah how long was it", "134:13", "first suggested maybe around the 2000 or", "134:15", "so and did it did a bunch of people jump", "134:17", "on board or one say if something like",

right", "134:26", "and so what you would do in that case", "134:28", "so someone proposed an idea and you say", "134:31", "well okay how would we test it how would", "134:32", "we know well maybe like

look", "140:34", "back into the known universe like the", "140:37", "what we can see is like 14 billion years", "140:39", "yeah but he was saying that that", "140:40", "essentially doesn't mean that

one year one second later right I", "141:22", "have heard that expression before that", "141:24", "space is moving faster than light so why", "141:26", "now why do they say they shouldn't say", "141:28", "that I know because they're lazy and bad", "141:32", "these are like high level guys yeah I", "141:34", "know", "141:34", "mmm okay so what is the never gonna be", "141:37", "invited back to quality conference after", "141:39", "this podcast well you always have the", "141:41", "infinite monkey cage yeah that would be", "141:43", "my new career right so what is happening", "141:46",

that light", "142:06", "can get between now and then", "142:09", "that's all there is so there are things", "142:11", "far away that are so far away we can", "142:14", "never possibly see them at this

stole the Big Bang oh okay so if all", "143:39", "matter is condensed into a very small", "143:42", "spot it doesn't mean that all things", "143:44", "around it are not infinitely large well", "143:48", "you don't want to say around it because", "143:49", "we're talking about the entire universe", "143:51", "so if you visualize an infinitely big", "143:55", "universe okay full of stuff okay", "143:57", "stuff stars galaxies okay stuff like", "144:00", "right now yeah right now okay and let's", "144:02", "wind the clock backwards so suck it all", "144:05", "in", "144:05", "yeah so the thing is that as far out as", "144:08", "you look even if you look at you know", "144:10", "with your God's eye view faster than the", "144:12", "speed of light there is still stuff out", "144:13", "there it's uniformly spread let's say", "144:16", "okay so but it's closer together it's", "144:20", "the relative size the relative distance", "144:22", "be", "144:23", "being galaxies and

billion years right up", "144:34", "to the Big Bang the universe could have", "144:36", "been infinitely big but the density the", "144:38", "amount of stuff in a cubic centimeter", "144:40", "goes to infinity whoa yeah how big is", "144:45", "the estimation that it was at the moment", "144:49", "of the Big Bang before like before it", "144:52", "expanded right it's thought to be fairly", "144:55",

"145:05", "this is maybe what gets lost because the", "145:08", "universe is finite in age we only see a", "145:10", "part of it okay I see a part of it a few", "145:12", "tens of billions of light years across", "145:14", "call that the observable universe", "145:16", "that's finite in size okay so that", "145:19", "definitely was smaller and there was an", "145:21", "actual number you can attach to the", "145:23", "question how big was it at the Big Bang", "145:25", "and we don't know the answer we we can", "145:29", "sort of it depends on theoretical", "145:30", "predictions it was the biggest possible", "145:33", "size it could have been was about a", "145:34", "centimeter across the biggest possible", "145:36", "yeah as big as it could be so you're", "145:39", "talking about essentially like a pinkie", "145:40", "nail that's right that's as big as the", "145:42", "whole universe could have been that", "145:44", "that's right in fact in this so", "145:46", "everything you

"146:21", "happened well what what is the reason", "146:25", "what evidence we have yeah like what", "146:27", "what is the current theory as to what", "146:30", "what the big bang like why did the Big", "146:32", "Bang take place well that's so that's a", "146:35", "good question so there's no", "146:36", "preferred conventional answer we just", "146:38", "don't know that's not that's not a we", "146:40", "don't know because we're not sure that's", "146:41", "how we have no idea is my answer", "146:44", "obviously if there was a bounce or if", "146:47", "there was some universe before

that", "146:58", "the Big Bang was truly the beginning of", "147:01", "the universe which is perfectly", "147:03", "plausible that's perfectly compatible", "147:04", "with the laws of physics and then

"151:34", "true and I think that this chain of", "151:37", "explanations bottoms out I think that", "151:39", "there will be one foundational point", "151:40", "which is not sort of self explanatory",

yeah and it could", "152:22", "the great thing there really so I", "152:24", "haven't blown your mind yet but now I'm", "152:26", "about to do it oh you already did when", "152:29", "you look at the

with", "153:42", "nothing in it but the Sun that universe", "153:44", "would have zero total energy if it were", "153:45", "closed in on itself whoa yeah it cancels", "153:50", "itself out yes so negative energy and", "153:54", "gravity cancels the positive energy and", "153:56", "stuff", "153:57", "therefore universe's can have zero total", "153:59", "energy and this is all obviously very",

the", "154:08", "current state of the art Wow so the", "154:13", "entire universe you believe revolves", "154:16", "around that principle free lunch yeah", "154:18", "you could easily so again if you can", "154:21", "make a universe at all then you can", "154:24", "probably make an infinite number of", "154:25", "universes just as easily it's not like", "154:28", "you have a hundred pounds of

being more than", "154:38", "one universe you start thinking about", "154:39", "the fact that there's a hundred million", "154:41", "galaxies in this or 100 million yep at", "154:44", "least a hundred million solar systems", "154:46", "right", "154:46", "and there's galaxies is one of hundreds", "154:49", "of billions of galaxies the known", "154:51", "universe and that there might be more",

"155:03", "yeah well that does get to be a bit of", "155:05", "an issue it at a certain point in time", "155:07", "just the mass of it all is defies it", "155:12", "suffice not just our understanding or", "155:15", "like for the average person like myself", "155:17", "it defies your ability to put than what", "155:24", "what you're describing into words right", "155:27", "that's a part of what the problem is", "155:29", "that's like I'm training like yes we", "155:31", "keep", "155:31", "into but here I can restore your Europe", "155:34", "your thought that we matter for the", "155:36", "bring it back bring it back we're", "155:38", "wrapping this up in some sense we are in", "155:42", "the middle of the smallest scales in the", "155:46", "important part of the universe versus", "155:48",

"156:04", "thing the universe is also very very", "156:06", "simple on large scales and it will get", "156:09", "only simpler in the future the universe", "156:11", "is sort of dissolving into emptiness as", "156:14", "the universe keeps expanding it's only", "156:17", "in between on scales like the size of a", "156:19", "human being or the earth and ecosphere", "156:21", "that things are complex right so even", "156:25", "though we're much smaller than the size", "156:26", "of the universe we're very big compared", "156:28", "to atoms the number of neurons in a", "156:31", "human brain is roughly the same as the", "156:33", "number of stars in a galaxy so we are", "156:36", "kind of a peak of structured nosov the", "156:41", "universe of complexity I mean until we", "156:43", "build even bigger artificial", "156:44", "intelligences and so forth but there's", "156:46", "something that we are maximizing", "156:48", "something that is is sort of", "156:51", "concentrated on us which is not size or", "156:55", "scale or time it is complication and", "156:58", "complexity Wow now in the same sense", "157:04", "that the the energy and the gravity of", "157:06", "the stars sort of manage to cancel each", "157:09", "other out yeah is that the case of", "157:10", "people as well well if this this is all", "157:14", "again math right the whole universe is a", "157:16", "free lunch", "157:17", "yeah the claim would be well consider a", "157:19", "universe with nothing in it but you pick", "157:24", "your favorite thing a person the star a", "157:25", "galaxies whatever then the total energy", "157:28", "in that thing minus the total energy in", "157:31", "this gravitational field because it's", "157:33", "negative would be exactly zero wow", "157:37", "that's super hard to wrap your head", "157:40", "around yeah", "157:42", "then there's the big question you", "157:44", "wouldn't get paid the big", "157:45", "if it were you but the big question is", "157:47", "why yeah why do you think this is all", "157:50", "happening or do you ever use that word", "157:52", "why it's why is a weird word right yeah", "157:55", "why is it where is happening it is so", "157:57", "what's causing it to happen what are the", "158:00", "forces that caused it to happen yeah", "158:01", "ever why do you ever look at all and go", "158:03", "is there a purpose to all this so short", "158:06", "and I think the answer is no I think", "158:08", "they no I think that yeah there's no", "158:10", "reason why and again just looking up", "158:14", "into the sky you know unless the purpose", "158:17", "was to make a pretty sky boy anything", "158:19", "that we're seeing here on earth could", "158:21", "have been done much with much less", "158:23", "effort than making 100 billion galaxies", "158:25", "right there's no evidence in anything we", "158:29", "learned about science or the universe", "158:31", "that gives us a reason to believe that", "158:33",

of the", "159:04", "universe is enormous Lee longer than", "159:07", "that according to our best current", "159:08", "theories it's it's way it's potentially", "159:10", "infinitely long anyway the
