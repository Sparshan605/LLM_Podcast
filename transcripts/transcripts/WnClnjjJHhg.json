so frantic and then when", "02:39", "I started realizing that if I would just", "02:40", "stop and slow it on and look at the very", "02:42", "tiniest details around me no matter", "02:44", "where I was or who I was with and I", "02:47", "started having a great appreciation of", "02:48", "my presence yeah so I'm sure something", "02:52", "like that is just because of the", "02:53", "darkness and because of the floating is", "02:54", "just hyper-extended into that presence", "02:56", "of you can trick yourself into thinking", "03:00", "that nothing else is going on in your", "03:03", "life right yeah no I agree with you I", "03:05", "think that we take this attitude that we", "03:08", "have in the city when you're dealing", "03:10", "with traffic and massive amounts of", "03:12",

I", "03:38", "actually had a friend of mine he's like", "03:39", "man I think you're I think you're", "03:41", "hunting too much I think this is gonna", "03:42", "catch up with you and you're gonna the", "03:44", "experience is gonna start to degrade for", "03:46", "you but it was almost like I was trying", "03:48", "to accomplish", "03:48", "really fast goals and when I started", "03:50",

"04:18", "hunt don't understand it and their", "04:21", "version of it they're getting either", "04:23", "from movies or hunters are always", "04:25", "portrayed as villains or they're", "04:27", "from these outdoor TV shows which I", "04:29", "don't think a good do a good job of", "04:31", "representing what it actually is even", "04:32", "the really good ones like Rinella show", "04:34", "which i think is the best show out there", "04:35", "sure it's still 22 minutes with", "04:39", "commercials and I just don't think that", "04:41", "you get a real sense of what it's like", "04:43", "what I think you did that's really", "04:45", "interesting and one of the reasons why I", "04:47", "wanted to have you on is you're doing", "04:49", "films like you're doing an hour-long", "04:52",

"05:12", "getting a blink of Oh", "05:14", "multiple weeks in the wilderness yeah", "05:17", "but you at least you get a feel like oh", "05:19", "this is something very different than", "05:22", "what's being portrayed this is like this", "05:24", "intense almost spiritual experience in", "05:27", "this very bizarre environment that", "05:30", "surrounds civilization and we think of", "05:33", "it you know in these weird terms but", "05:36", "when you're out there in it it's very", "05:38", "difficult to capture what that's like", "05:40", "and I think you've done an amazing job", "05:42", "at doing that here's Jamie's put some of", "05:44", "your stuff up online here where you get", "05:45", "a chance to see it but and I appreciate", "05:48", "that it's some hunting it drives me nuts", "05:50", "go ahead no no it's just I'm just gonna", "05:53", "say I mean whoever is doing your you're", "05:55", "editing don't know he's fantastic yeah", "05:58", "he's really talented he does a really", "05:59", "really good job of of just picking good", "06:02", "shots and just the overall experience is", "06:05", "relayed very well like you get a chance", "06:08", "to see like oh this this is an adventure", "06:10", "this isn't just as simple as you know", "06:13", "someone's going out there trying to fill", "06:14", "a freezer with wild game meat no you're", "06:16", "you're on an adventure and then the wild", "06:19", "game meat is a part of it yeah it's all", "06:21", "absolutely a lot of shit going on and", "06:22", "this was this piece right here was", "06:24", "specifically done for Nat Geo because", "06:27", "they have the National Geographic", "06:30", "Society which is the magazine and then I", "06:32", "have National Geographic which is the TV", "06:34", "show and so they wanted to do they hit", "06:37", "me up for a bunch of TV shows they", "06:39", "wanted me to", "06:40", "you know come and find Bigfoot they", "06:41", "wanted me to I yeah they know the fucker", "06:45", "they called me for everything maybe they", "06:47", "would call me and say uh where are you", "06:50", "right now where are where's your cabin", "06:52", "and I'd say I don't have a cabin and", "06:54", "they said surely you're skinning a", "06:56", "beaver out right now no no I live in", "06:59", "Wisconsin just out of Minneapolis and", "07:00", "I'm walking my Labrador down the street", "07:03", "in shorts and and so they said well they", "07:07", "they really want to do a TV show and", "07:08", "they wanted it to encapsulate hunting to", "07:12", "some degree but the society the magazine", "07:15", "was against hunting the TV show would", "07:18", "allow it so they wanted me to do a", "07:21", "no-bullshit a sermon if you will", "07:24", "download looking down the barrel of the", "07:26", "camera and just said this isn't gonna go", "07:28", "public this doesn't have to be pretty", "07:29", "it's not gonna be edited well but just", "07:31", "please tell us why you hunt try to", "07:34", "explain it so that we can bring it to", "07:36", "our producers and same it like this is", "07:39", "why he hunts and so I did this had my", "07:41", "little temper tantrum there and and in", "07:44", "doing it realized like it made me really", "07:47", "question you know I'd say okay so you", "07:49", "want to know why I hunt and then it made", "07:51", "me take a step back and say man for the", "07:55", "love of God I really don't even know I", "07:57", "don't know why I hunt but I can explain", "07:59", "some of the areas it doesn't explain why", "08:02", "I'm a hunter it doesn't explain exactly", "08:04", "why I hunt but I can tell you I love the", "08:07", "adventure I can tell you I love the", "08:09", "really clean protein that I get for me", "08:11", "and my family I can tell you that our", "08:13", "ancestry unequivocally comes from 100%", "08:17", "groups of hunters and gatherers that's", "08:19", "around the world I can tell you all of", "08:21", "these points I can tell you that I love", "08:23", "seeing antlers of all sizes and and the", "08:26", "hides and I can tell you I love watching", "08:27", "grizzly bears eat blueberries and", "08:29", "watching salmon come up a river to spawn", "08:31", "I can tell you all of these things but I", "08:34", "don't know if all of those things make", "08:36", "me a hunter or if I'm just experiencing", "08:38", "all those things because I am a hunter", "08:39", "it's just very difficult to articulate", "08:41", "it's very difficult to articulate how", "08:44", "much you love something yet you're", "08:46", "willing to engage it in such a heavy way", "08:50", "such a violent way that you're willing", "08:52", "to step in", "08:53", "kill it cut it up get your hands bloody", "08:56", "because really that's what it is we love", "08:58", "it so much that we're willing to expose", "09:02", "ourselves to the elements put ourselves", "09:04", "in these places let the arrow or the", "09:06", "bullet go watch an animal dive which is", "09:09", "never never an interesting thing to walk", "09:12", "I say interesting but it's just not a", "09:14", "pleasurable thing to watch but if this", "09:15", "is how we engage as hunters into these", "09:17", "environments and so I was trying to", "09:19", "convey that to NatGeo in a seven-minute", "09:23", "piece and Kyle after he put it together", "09:26", "he's like I think we should release it", "09:27", "and I said hell no hell no I talked", "09:29", "about PETA in it", "09:30", "I talked about being a vegetarian in it", "09:33", "which I'm not against vegetarianism I'm", "09:35", "PETA's oh joke but but he insisted so", "09:39", "he'd finally won the argument and you", "09:41", "know well Peter you know the idea behind", "09:45", "Ethical Treatment of Animals is amazing", "09:48", "of course I mean you like you're saying", "09:50", "you have a Labrador the idea that", "09:51", "hunters hate animals too is also a very", "09:53", "confusing thing this is Hunter's love", "09:55", "animals you know there's a lot of", "09:57", "hunters that have dogs and cats", "09:58", "yeah but Ethical Treatment of Animals is", "10:01", "is imperative it's very important I mean", "10:05", "we are if we are really the stewards of", "10:07", "nature if we were really the top of the", "10:08", "food chain we most certainly are we and", "10:11", "we're conscious and we have a conscience", "10:13", "we absolutely should be ethical in our", "10:15", "Treatment of Animals and take care of", "10:17", "them and be kind to them which the", "10:20", "problem with PETA is that's not really", "10:22", "what they're about they're the Animal", "10:24", "Liberation Organization that's what they", "10:26", "really are well they're about they don't", "10:27", "want any animals to be pets they don't", "10:30", "want people to have pets like this is I", "10:33", "mean that this sounds radical but it's", "10:34", "absolutely true in fact PETA euthanizes", "10:37", "thousands of pets a year they kill pets", "10:40", "and they killed them quickly they don't", "10:42", "keep them alive very long and the idea", "10:44", "being is that for the critics the idea", "10:47", "has been bandied about is they don't", "10:49", "want these animals to live and breed and", "10:51", "stay pets they want animals to only be", "10:53", "wild and that's fine but there's", "10:56", "thousands and thousands of years of", "10:59", "domesticated animals and if you want to", "11:01", "let those animals loose they'd have them", "11:03", "wild you have a whole another series of", "11:06", "problems", "11:07", "you want to kill all the golden", "11:08", "retrievers and all the chihuahuas not",

yeah", "11:18", "like like a little fat kids not a wild", "11:21", "animal either you leave him in the woods", "11:22", "he's gonna die just as quickly as your", "11:24", "fucking Chihuahua he's gonna be food", "11:25", "yeah they're not gonna make it yes this", "11:27", "is not you know so there's a there's a", "11:30", "weird ideology that they're attached to", "11:33", "that is it's it's it's not tenable it's", "11:37", "not no you can't argue it you know the", "11:41", "idea of Ethical Treatment of Animals I'm", "11:43", "a hundred percent with that I fucking", "11:44", "hate the whole idea of captive orcas", "11:48", "that to me is one of the big rows that", "11:50", "freaks me the fuck out that we can take", "11:52", "these alien creatures that are", "11:54", "essentially as smart as us probably and", "11:57", "put them in swimming pools and justify", "12:00", "it and that the only time they've ever", "12:01", "killed people in recorded history has", "12:04", "been in those swimming pools", "12:05", "yeah they don't kill people in the wild", "12:07", "they kill everything else they killed", "12:08", "whales they kill dolphins they kill", "12:10", "sharks they don't fuck with people in", "12:12", "fact there's been instances where", "12:13", "they've saved people mm-hmm and yet", "12:16", "we've decided to put the so me and PETA", "12:18", "are on the 100% the same page as that", "12:20", "and Peeta's retweeted a bunch of shit", "12:22", "that I've put up before which are really", "12:24", "weird", "12:24", "they retweeted a bunch of shit that I", "12:26", "put up about you know about orcas and", "12:29", "when I've done that people like you know", "12:32", "he hunts right and then then it gets you", "12:34", "know radio silence they just want to", "12:38", "support my hate for you know Orca", "12:41", "captain you know I I had um one of the", "12:44", "most I've had some I've been fortunate", "12:46", "to have remarkable engagements with", "12:48", "wildlife in my life but two years ago in", "12:51", "NBC I had one with a killer whale it was", "12:53", "it was wicked and to this day I regret", "12:57", "not making the decision I'm about to", "12:59", "tell you about but we had been I'd been", "13:02", "bear hunting on the coast and we were in", "13:04", "a boat cruising back to the harbor and", "13:06", "we found two pods of killer whales three", "13:09", "big bowls and a bunch of cows that were", "13:10", "hunting and we kept as they would come", "13:13", "up they were chasing salmon and as they", "13:15", "would come up we just get closer just to", "13:17", "film them or even just to see them and", "13:19", "then they'd go down and", "13:21", "so I don't know if it was just", "13:22", "happenstance of where we were but we", "13:25", "came up we were just kind of waiting for", "13:27", "the whole pod to come up and all the Sun", "13:30", "just 50 feet from the boat here comes", "13:32", "the huge dorsal fin of this bowl comes", "13:35", "right at our boat bumps into our boat", "13:38", "I'm standing on the in the crow's nest", "13:41", "essentially I'm on the roof of the boat", "13:42", "looking at this thing he comes up bumps", "13:44", "into our boat and he just glides his", "13:47", "left side", "13:48", "all along the boat so his left pectoral", "13:51", "fin is probably under our gunnel if you", "13:54", "will or under our hull and so he's just", "13:56", "dragging his fin and he rotates on his", "13:59", "side dragging his dorsal fin along our", "14:01", "side exhales covering our director of", "14:05", "photography Williams face in his spray", "14:07", "and as he's doing this he goes he hugs", "14:10", "the bow of our boat and he never ever", "14:13", "breaks eye contact with me he's staring", "14:16", "at me out of his left eye literally", "14:18", "rolling his eye over and he just cruises", "14:20", "all the way around the boat and I wanted", "14:24", "to dive in and I just wasn't sure like I", "14:27", "didn't want to be one of these got a", "14:29", "dive I didn't want to be the first guy", "14:32", "to diet I didn't also didn't want to", "14:33", "have like some sort of shallow water", "14:35", "blackout because the water was so cold", "14:37", "so I didn't want to dive in and have all", "14:38", "Sun like I didn't know how my body would", "14:41", "react because I hadn't been in the water", "14:42", "yet and so and then also I was like I", "14:45", "you know I'd watched blackfish or", "14:47", "whatever that film is where they killed", "14:48", "a bunch of folks at you know in in", "14:50", "SeaWorld and NBC and so I was just like", "14:53", "well what if you know there's got to be", "14:55", "at first you know wolves never killed", "14:57", "anyone any

path yeah I'm just saying you know", "15:07", "like you know in recorded time but it", "15:09", "was still it was it was and he", "15:11", "maintained eye contact", "15:12", "turned and then just continued on with", "15:14", "the hunt but if you film all this yeah", "15:17", "what you've filmed as much as we could", "15:18", "because it happened really fast but yeah", "15:20", "it was wicked

and", "23:04", "hunting equipment in order to kill those", "23:06", "animals so the way those animals are", "23:08", "sustained and the way the Wildlife's are", "23:10", "protected in the way that the wardens", "23:13", "and game rangers are paid is a lot of it", "23:17", "is through the hunters who want to go", "23:19", "out and kill the animals that live on so", "23:21", "it's like a lot of people like okay this", "23:23", "is wild sorta but it's also a sword sort", "23:27", "it's protected by people that want to go", "23:29", "in that water and engage it yeah not not", "23:32", "I mean we're reducing it to a single", "23:33", "variable so you want to protect these", "23:35", "Elks you can go in there and kill an elk", "23:36", "no I want to protect these first of all", "23:39", "I want to protect the habitat right so", "23:41", "these elk can thrive and then in certain", "23:44", "instances go in and remove a few animals", "23:46", "or in certain instances like if you're", "23:48", "an Alaska or something like that and", "23:49", "hunting a stable caribou herd you can go", "23:51", "in and remove you know not everything is", "23:53", "based off of soul management right as", "23:55", "animals encroach where people are we", "23:57", "need to cut their numbers down because", "23:59", "humans have taken up so much land but", "24:01", "there are other populations that are", "24:03", "trending in relative harmony if they", "24:07", "have big huge scales of land we are not", "24:09", "drilling for oil or whatever where we", "24:11", "can go and remove a few a few animals", "24:12", "and they're predator and prey scenario", "24:14", "and it works just fine for the herd it", "24:16", "works just fine for the population and", "24:17", "actually in a very small way helps the", "24:21", "population by removing certain animals", "24:22", "for an age class or a sex class things", "24:24", "like that", "24:26", "vasa difficulties we're preserving the", "24:29", "habitat so the weekend going and engage", "24:31", "in the wild right I mean I think also a", "24:33", "lot of people they think you buy your", "24:35", "gun you buy your bow you buy your tag", "24:38", "you go to Utah you leave with an elk", "24:41", "well that is how it works for like 15", "24:44", "percent of the people if that if that", "24:46", "but there's a whole contingent of 80% or", "24:49", "90% of people that buy their bow by", "24:52", "their gun by their pickup truck get", "24:54", "their hotel room get their tent hiked 20", "24:57", "miles into the wilderness", "24:58", "strike out listen to a lot of quiet look", "25:02", "around hike out get back in their truck", "25:04", "drive home send me an email saying where", "25:07", "is it that you find elk around September", "25:09", "15th in Utah and so there's instill", "25:12", "those people are engaging and still you", "25:14", "know and there's all different wise", "25:15", "there's you know there's fly fishermen", "25:17", "and elk hunters and and there's people", "25:19", "that just want to take photos and so", "25:20", "everyone has their different engagement", "25:21", "but that's really what it's about and we", "25:23", "have what we're trending towards eight", "25:26", "billion people on the face there yeah so", "25:28", "well at large-scale agriculture and", "25:31", "farming and in an animal agriculture as", "25:34", "well has created this environment where", "25:37", "people can thrive in these cities yeah", "25:39", "where they're not growing any food I", "25:41", "mean California where we're at right now", "25:42", "it's one of the weirdest places on the", "25:44", "planet Earth there's 20 million people", "25:46", "no one's growing anything but weed I", "25:47",

hit", "27:54", "we went one direction you cannot go away", "27:57", "we were hunters and gatherers we could", "27:58", "only raise so many children we had to", "28:00", "move with the food we had to move away", "28:03", "from our excrement we had to keep a", "28:05", "small population but the second we", "28:08", "figured out how to grow corn and rice", "28:10", "and stay in one place and raise more", "28:13", "than one child and now we're close to", "28:15", "our excrement literally the stopwatch to", "28:17", "something that is going to be a", "28:19", "fantastic event has started yeah I don't", "28:22", "know if I'm gonna see it I don't know if", "28:23", "you're gonna see it but something wicked", "28:25", "is coming and and manohar way to look", "28:29", "around there's there there's anyway", "28:32", "something over population over", "28:35", "populations is something will happen you", "28:37", "know human beings are animals we have", "28:39", "awesome thumbs we have great brains but", "28:41", "we are nothing there's nothing amazing", "28:44", "about us we can fly to the moon we can", "28:46", "do all this great stuff by the way I", "28:49", "loved your

"29:30", "anymore", "29:30", "right so we pump in the nitrogen we pump", "29:32", "in the phosphorus the rescue there's a", "29:34", "lot of people don't understand that you", "29:35", "when you use

"32:35", "the too much of the lichen yeah so they", "32:37", "just their habitat resource just starts", "32:40", "to be overlaid and then they have", "32:41", "another another Boston so so I went and", "32:44", "did it but there's there's a constant", "32:47", "meaning and yang and as a hunter as a", "32:50", "vegetarian even if you want to claim", "32:52", "veganism all of these things we

they're you know and I say you're", "41:21", "full of crap and so I did a hunt two", "41:23", "years ago with a very dear friend of", "41:25", "mine I won't mention his name because", "41:26", "he'd be mortified as he should be but I", "41:29", "said hey let's eat some bears and when I", "41:32", "get there and we kill a bear and he's", "41:34", "like what what if you don't kill a bear", "41:35", "I said I'll tell you what he had a few", "41:38", "bear hunts before me I said please when", "41:40", "he kills very old bears and I said", "41:43", "please save the raddest bear that you", "41:47",

and that", "42:05", "the fat was yellow and it looked", "42:06", "horrible and he told me that when he was", "42:09", "skinning it he actually saw some worms", "42:10", "underneath the you know the hide it and", "42:12", "they always have worms yeah yes it's a", "42:14", "constant and so so we made it that night", "42:18", "along with some bighorn sheep and which", "42:22", "is fantastic eating

ways one one day or one", "42:35", "way we did it because we were kind of", "42:37", "having a dinner party at a cabin and so", "42:39", "we made just these little tiny", "42:40", "medallions and it was really funny to", "42:43", "his reaction so then we just pan-seared", "42:46", "it with butter and garlic and onions and", "42:48", "just ate it like little whatever chicken", "42:51", "mcnuggets if you will and he ate that", "42:53", "he's like oh yeah I mean you combine", "42:54", "anything with butter and and onions and", "42:57", "garlic it's gonna taste good and I'm", "42:58", "like did

a liar you know and then so so", "43:09", "then that night we made this big roast", "43:11", "and we seared it all sides right and", "43:12", "seasoned it all up made a nice rub and", "43:14", "put it in this broth with vegetables and", "43:16", "everything and he ate that and of course", "43:18", "he's like well I mean you made a rabe", "43:20", "and you sear it and I'm like well if you", "43:21", "suck at cooking it's not the Bears fault", "43:23", "right I bear meats delicious I'm not", "43:25", "telling you to eat it raw off his", "43:26", "skeleton the moment you're skinning him", "43:28", "but if you take the time to you prepare", "43:31", "the flesh when you when you're in the", "43:33", "field and then cook it well it's amazing", "43:36", "it's amazing you're dealing with his", "43:38", "internal biases yeah yeah he's got his", "43:40", "biases and he's just had them and held", "43:42", "on to him forever and especially if", "43:44", "you're skinning something you see worms", "43:45", "and get grossed out yeah and you already", "43:47", "think it's weird", "43:48", "yeah no Rinella told me a story once", "43:50", "about a bear that he shot and killed and", "43:52",

he", "44:10", "killed had just been eating nothing but", "44:12", "fish yeah and he said that when he was", "44:13", "eating it it was like eating smoked fish", "44:16", "I think it was really good yeah buddy", "44:18", "but it was this weird taste yeah because", "44:20", "it was like you're eating this red meat", "44:22", "that tastes like smoked fish yeah", "44:24", "it's wicked they're awesome they're", "44:26", "awesome everybody go Barry if you had a", "44:28", "blueberry bear but yes I've never had", "44:30", "that I've heard a most incredible meat", "44:32", "on the planet Earth in fact I got", "44:33", "dropped off four or five six years ago I", "44:36", "was in the Arctic for 30 or so days and", "44:39", "the pilot dropped us off and he goes hey", "44:42", "do you have a bear tag and I said yeah I", "44:44", "have a bear tagging he's like if you", "44:45", "kill the bear he's like just tons of", "44:47", "bears when I'm dropping you off he's", "44:48", "like it tuns the Grizzlies tons of black", "44:50", "bears which is uncommon but I'm he's", "44:53", "like if you kill the black bear he's", "44:54", "like and you don't want the meat I'll", "44:55", "take it you know he'd made it very clear", "44:57", "before he even dropped us off and I said", "44:59", "no well we'll keep it but we'll share", "45:01", "with you for sure we'll definitely share", "45:02", "some with you but it's phenomenal yeah", "45:04", "Rinella was telling me that it's the", "45:07", "literally the greatest meat on earth", "45:09", "like when you have a bear that's been", "45:11", "eating nothing but blueberries and he", "45:12", "did a an episode of meat-eater once we", "45:14", "shot one and as he's opening it up you", "45:16", "see purple fat yeah because the Bears", "45:19", "have been eating blueberries for so long", "45:20", "their fat is purple yeah it made me", "45:22", "think about my own diet quite honestly", "45:24", "because if this thing tastes so good and", "45:27", "smells so good because of what it's", "45:28", "eating I'm like if you're eating like", "45:30", "fucking cheeseburgers and fries like", "45:32", "that's got to be in your fat let's get", "45:34", "all that bullshit food yeah you know", "45:36", "fucking Donuts that's got to be in your", "45:38", "cells yeah you literally are what you", "45:41", "eat yeah we know it but do you", "45:43", "internalize it I think when you see a", "45:45", "bear that has purple fat maybe you", "45:47", "internalize it even more I think so yeah", "45:50", "I mean anytime you're able to spend you", "45:54", "know you know you're you're you're", "45:56", "dismantling an animal or something like", "45:58", "that you actually get to see these", "46:00", "things and yeah if you have the same", "46:01", "perspective or wherewithal that we were", "46:03", "talking about a few minutes ago that's", "46:05", "when you sit there and go wait a minute", "46:06", "you're not just mindlessly skinning this", "46:08", "bear your sender going is my fat look", "46:11", "like skittles right pounded a bag of", "46:13", "skittles yesterday right I heard they", "46:15", "are gross though if they've been

inside of its ribcage and they", "46:44", "come out look they sound too much hair", "46:46", "gel and just that's so foul yeah we", "46:51", "actually good yeah yeah no how did you", "46:54", "cook it that same same way actually I", "46:56", "did more medallions that way because I", "46:58", "was backpacking so I ate it right on the", "47:00", "beach when you talk about bear hunting", "47:01", "you really you're going up against years", "47:04", "of movies you know years of fucking Yogi", "47:08", "and boo-boo", "47:09", "and people have this weird perception of", "47:13", "what a bear is and we are the only", "47:17", "things that keep their population in", "47:19", "check the only things if you care about", "47:21", "deer and if you care about moose and if", "47:23", "you care about other

have to like you have", "47:34", "to be careful though right I mean they", "47:35", "need to be controlled in certain areas", "47:38", "certain areas there's probably a decent", "47:39", "balance because there's not a lot of", "47:41", "there's not a lot of food so they might", "47:43", "not be focusing on moose calves right", "47:46", "there might not be a lot of moose or", "47:47", "something like that but in areas where", "47:48", "there's great overlap like it's", "47:50", "definitely there's there they don't get", "47:53", "killed a lot right and so people don't", "47:55", "hunt them a lot in general and and", "47:59", "people just they you know they they they", "48:03", "instantly go to the ungulates right the", "48:05", "inste go to the deer and the moose and", "48:06", "caribou things like that but yeah", "48:07", "there's definitely need to be managed a", "48:10", "place I hunted I was bear hunting last", "48:11", "week in BC and the place I was hunting", "48:14", "hasn't really been hunted in like ten", "48:16", "years and you just know that these bears", "48:19", "are so terribly successful at stealing", "48:22", "mule deer fawns and moose calves in this", "48:24", "area and and I've seen it before and you", "48:27", "just see them like I killed a grizzly", "48:30", "bear a few years ago that was I", "48:31", "shouldn't say I killed it we it charged", "48:35", "us and so the guy that I was with he had", "48:36", "to shoot", "48:37", "um and so he killed it but as soon as", "48:39", "the bullet hit the bear he pooped out", "48:42", "too too calm moose calves and we had", "48:45", "weeds we had seen a cow with two calves", "48:48", "two twins and then he was just cruising", "48:51", "up and down the river and so he he", "48:53",

want him the ranchers were I", "53:22", "was really surprised but the ranchers", "53:24", "were like you know we want you to kill", "53:25", "this cat because he's sport killing", "53:28", "these deer but we want Ben to be very", "53:31", "measured in how he takes cats because", "53:33", "they really love cats in this area and", "53:34", "they just want Ben to be cognizant of", "53:36", "the animals he removes which he is", "53:37", "anyway but they love cats just because", "53:39", "they just love the idea of them but", "53:42", "Wildlife yeah the symbolism of the wild", "53:44", "and then all these ranchers they raise", "53:45", "cattle and they watch the wolves harass", "53:49", "their cattle but they watched the cats", "53:51", "will literally walk right through a calf",

and", "54:01", "just carry on about his day because he", "54:04", "wants to kill a deer and sheet that's", "54:06", "that somebody wants to fixate on he", "54:07", "doesn't want to deal probably with mama", "54:08", "cow but right so we tracked this thing", "54:11", "for 22 kilometers we actually got down", "54:13", "on it on top of a mule deer kill that", "54:15", "had made the night before bumped it and", "54:18", "it ran way up into the mountains and", "54:19", "these in these hills and we tracked it", "54:21", "all the way up there we tracked another", "54:22", "four or five kilometers and then that's", "54:25", "when we released the hounds and it was", "54:27", "wicked to see the enthusiasm in the", "54:30", "hounds like I just pictured something", "54:32", "that was gonna be bloodthirsty and like", "54:34", "you know they they wanted to rip this", "54:38", "cat apart but these hounds they look on", "54:40", "their faces and I'm making you know I'm", "54:41", "making judgments here but the look on", "54:43", "their faces were just pure enthusiasm", "54:46", "like this is a game like our job is to", "54:49", "is to chase this cat down well that's", "54:52", "how they've been trained yeah and and to", "54:53", "get it in a tree like they're not", "54:54", "sitting there going we were gonna catch", "54:56", "and kill this cat they're like our job", "54:58", "is to kind of get it in the tree you", "55:00", "know right it was just really cool to be", "55:02", "around the dogs and watch their energy", "55:04", "and so they went treed the lion we snuck", "55:07", "in on the line and he he he didn't like", "55:09", "it and see he jumped off and the dogs", "55:11", "and student pursuit again and then we", "55:13", "treat him again and I killed him and", "55:14", "killing him was", "55:17", "neither here nor there it wasn't it was", "55:21", "just an act it was just a light switch", "55:25", "for me it was been needs", "55:27", "been had spoke with the biologist they", "55:29", "wanted a certain amount of cats removed", "55:31", "from this area because they were really", "55:32", "having predatory impact on the sheep in", "55:36", "the in the deer and I kind of found out", "55:38", "why afterwards when I spoke to the", "55:39", "biologist but and we got him in three", "55:41", "and been just like a he's a big Tom and", "55:43", "he's an old Tom and so we're gonna kill", "55:47", "him anyway", "55:48", "so if you want to kill him kill him if", "55:49", "not we're gonna kill him you know and", "55:51", "they had tags too everything was legal", "55:52", "I said no I'll kill him I wanted to take", "55:55", "the process all the way through so I", "55:56", "killed him he died very quickly and I", "56:00", "had always heard that their meat was", "56:01", "really good and I'd also heard people", "56:03", "say it's unedible so of course I don't", "56:06", "kill anything unless I'm gonna eat it so", "56:08", "we ate it it was arguably the finest", "56:11", "meat I'd ever had in my life it's", "56:13", "nothing Rinella told me he said it", "56:14", "tastes like that's pork you've ever had", "56:16", "yeah well I'm not even a big fan of pork", "56:18", "like I like pork but it was you know", "56:19", "pork is okay mountain lion is like", "56:21", "succulent flavorful deep rich pork it's", "56:24", "just absolutely unbelievable the fat is", "56:28", "supposed to be really good as well yeah", "56:29", "yeah absolutely and and so it's just", "56:32", "really rewarding experience for me and", "56:34", "like then I got to hang out with the", "56:35", "dogs afterwards and then when I wouldn't", "56:36", "spoke with the biologist that was", "56:38", "eye-opening as well because the hounds", "56:41", "been weird with he kind of guessed the", "56:42", "cat to be like five or six years old", "56:44", "which would be very old it turned out to", "56:45", "be three and which is amazing that they", "56:48", "go from a kitten to this thing was like", "56:50", "175 180 pounds in that big that big in", "56:55", "just three years and and the biologists", "56:57", "even told me he had one come in earlier", "57:00", "that year that was over 200 is like 2:02", "57:01", "2:03 which is about as big as they get", "57:04", "and it was radio collared and he's like", "57:06", "oh this is gonna be wicked because we", "57:07", "have the radio collar I'm gonna be able", "57:09", "to call the bio just that radio collared", "57:11", "this thing it's 200 pounds of saying", "57:13", "it's got to be like five or six seven", "57:14", "years old he called the guy and the", "57:16", "thing was just had barely leaves like", "57:20", "just over two years old and he's already", "57:22", "200 pounds two years old yes and they're", "57:26", "just so and with you know like sometimes", "57:29", "aging deer aging bear", "57:30", "is kind of a tricky prospect you're", "57:32", "looking at the molar where and you're", "57:33", "looking at their lateral sizes and their", "57:36", "medial incisors and you're looking at", "57:39", "where and everything with the liens it's", "57:41", "very easy to see like they have their", "57:44", "age classes have distinct dental changes", "57:47", "that happen like it's it's there's", "57:48", "there's kind of no middle ground and so", "57:50", "you know and of course the radio collar", "57:52", "they knew but they're just so terribly", "57:55", "successful and just looking at the", "57:57", "amount of biomass they put on their", "57:59", "bodies just their their size and how", "58:01", "they carry it fucking forearms oh yeah", "58:03", "that's where arms are like a human thigh", "58:05", "that's what freaked me out because I'm", "58:07", "sitting there holding this thing's gone", "58:10", "out body it's kind of where skin skin", "58:12", "ambani and is it weighs the exact same", "58:15", "as a deer like it's the same thing as a", "58:17", "deer but the proportions are way off", "58:18", "right the thing is so much shorter the", "58:21", "meat you know goes all the way down to", "58:24", "their paws so they can jump you know 30", "58:26", "feet out of a tree and land and just", "58:28", "like you and I would be rolling around", "58:30", "on ground going oh my God look at my", "58:31", "femur and these guys just boom and", "58:33", "they're off to the races and it's just", "58:35", "you know you drop it they weigh the same", "58:37", "as a deer you drop a deer out of a tree", "58:38", "and it's gonna have four broken legs", "58:40", "these things just land and freaky", "58:43", "animals and so and so I was gonna say so", "58:45", "the sport killing so the biologist told", "58:47", "me with the area where there's a lot of", "58:49", "wolves and so the Wolves the Lions are", "58:52", "so much more successful at killing than", "58:54", "the wolves that the Wolves just become", "58:56", "somewhat lazy and they'll get in these", "58:59", "little packs and they'll literally find", "59:00", "a big Tom and they'll just follow him", "59:01", "and so what this cat is doing is", "59:04", "scientists have observed him killing", "59:06", "deer and he'll literally kill in cash", "59:08", "deer and sheep so that when the Wolves", "59:11", "find his cash is the Wolves will eat and", "59:13", "so then he can he can go and eat in on", "59:15", "in peace himself so he doesn't get", "59:18", "fucked with by the wolves", "59:19", "yeah he's leaving them food he's leaving", "59:21", "them food which is why the ranchers", "59:22", "thought because they're like he killed", "59:24", "the deer and you didn't do anything with", "59:25", "it he just killed a deer and so they're", "59:27", "like no no he killed the deer and it's", "59:28", "funny because when we tracked him that", "59:29", "day he brought us to nine kill sites", "59:32", "that day Wow yep so he's literally doing", "59:37", "that while you're chasing I'm saying", "59:38", "look just eat this leave me the fuck", "59:40", "alone yeah so as as you're tracking him", "59:42", "he's", "59:43", "tracking you past spots hoping that you", "59:46", "take his cash and leave him alone yep", "59:49", "Wow yeah it was a fantastic experience", "59:52", "and and then the biologist also told me", "59:54", "and I was like we had a lot of", "59:57", "contention while coming here in hunting", "59:58", "lions and I you know I do you know I", "60:00", "don't know how successful they are", "60:02", "repopulating you know we almost hunted", "60:03", "them to extinction at the turn of the", "60:05", "century and they're just starting to", "60:06", "kind of make they're starting to expand", "60:08", "now back into their some of their", "60:10", "original territories he's like hey man", "60:13", "Donnie's like this is a great animal to", "60:15", "take this is an area that receives very", "60:16", "little lion hunting we have to take some", "60:18", "of these lines on he showed me data that", "60:20", "they had on this one lion and I don't", "60:23", "want to misquote the data but basically", "60:24", "the single lion had removed like nine or", "60:26", "eleven percent of this particular sheep", "60:28", "herd in a year", "60:30", "just like boom boom boom and this dude", "60:34", "knew the game he knew where to kill he", "60:37", "knew how to kill and he they have no", "60:39", "chance I mean he's just a super press", "60:41", "you have no chance if he finds them he's", "60:43", "gonna kill them yeah it runs faster he's", "60:45", "stronger and if he gets ahold of them", "60:46", "they never they never lose never like", "60:49", "like a deer gets away no they win every", "60:52", "time no so so it's right on the same", "60:55", "like you know same path as all the", "60:57", "Predators it's me you know you just it", "60:59", "leads to really good discussions but", "61:01", "people get upset when you kill predators", "61:02", "they get very upset what's it's really", "61:04", "strange because they don't they don't", "61:05", "have any problem with the predator", "61:06", "killing deer and they have less problem", "61:09", "with people killing deer but they have a", "61:11", "real problem people killing predators", "61:12", "and I believe it's the same problem they", "61:14", "have with like Cecil the lion and shit", "61:16", "like that", "61:16", "they think that you're just doing it to", "61:18", "be an asshole and you just want this", "61:20", "thing on your wall well I'm gonna head", "61:22", "on your wall I do have some contention", "61:24", "and you tell me and like like for", "61:26", "instance like the grizzly bear issue", "61:28", "being shut down in BC no he's a bear", "61:30", "grizzly bear hunting maybe you can", "61:32", "explain that from yeah I don't", "61:33", "understand what's going on yeah so so", "61:36", "the government the British Columbia", "61:37", "government shut down British Columbia", "61:39", "British Columbia grizzly bear hunting", "61:41", "because they equated it and I guess", "61:44", "they're probably correct with trophy", "61:46", "hunting right we're hunters were killing", "61:48", "these animals and just taking the skulls", "61:51", "and hides and leaving the flesh behind", "61:53", "and and I don't know I've never", "61:57", "have I I grizzly bear hunted NBC once", "62:00", "but I was actually more on a sheep on", "62:02", "but yeah just this notion of like like", "62:06", "the gentleman that killed Cecil the lion", "62:07", "like if you're really going to kill an", "62:09", "animal and just take its hide", "62:13", "then I've pretty significant issue with", "62:16", "that and so like I just hope these", "62:19", "hunters that the guys that were hunting", "62:20", "the grizzly bears I just I wonder if", "62:22", "this was more of a hunter instilled", "62:25", "issue then then people are even bringing", "62:29", "light into it because if people were", "62:31", "killing grizzly bears in British", "62:33", "Columbia taking their hides taking their", "62:35", "skulls and taking all the flesh I feel", "62:38", "like we'd still be grizzly bear hunting", "62:39", "in British Columbia I don't know I mean", "62:42", "maybe maybe but grizzly bears are", "62:45", "another notch up even above black bears", "62:47", "in terms of like correct yeah but", "62:49", "Rinella calls charismatic megafauna", "62:52", "people love those things like they see", "62:54", "them yeah and if you don't have to deal", "62:56", "with them if you don't like that guy in", "62:58", "Anna's Colorado last year they got his", "62:59", "head cut open by one if you don't have", "63:01", "to deal with them you know they are", "63:03", "amazing to look at and we all want them", "63:06", "around and of course they're an", "63:07", "incredible animal but it's this thing of", "63:10", "trophy hunting these what you think of", "63:12", "some fat lazy asshole with a rifle that", "63:15", "stands on top of a lion you know there's", "63:17", "this image that I found online and I was", "63:20", "looking I was like that is that's why", "63:23", "people have a problem with trophies on", "63:25", "a5 this fat fuck who should never in a", "63:29", "million years without that rifle had", "63:32", "have ever the help yeah or the help", "63:35", "especially the help right mm-hmm", "63:37", "like there's no way he would have got on", "63:39", "it there's nobody who got to that", "63:40", "position he must have got there in a car", "63:42", "you know and then they have this line", "63:44", "there and he's perched up on the line", "63:46", "like he did some amazing thing yeah and", "63:48", "meanwhile that's probably one of those", "63:50", "caged lions anyway it isn't mean yeah", "63:52", "they have so many of those high fence", "63:54", "hunts where they let these Lions they", "63:56", "have them all caged up in a pen they", "63:58", "throw cows over the dead cows over the", "64:01", "pen over the wall the pen the lines", "64:03", "tearing apart and then they pick one and", "64:06", "take that one out into the the you know", "64:09", "wilderness area which", "64:10", "fenced in anyway and then they let it", "64:12", "loose and the the lion stays in the area", "64:15", "because it has no idea what its boundary", "64:17", "is what its territory is what other", "64:19", "lions are in that area so a lot of times", "64:20", "they sit still and they wait for a while", "64:23", "before they figure out what their", "64:24", "territory is the hunter comes in shoots", "64:26", "it stands on it takes a picture I mean", "64:28", "you shot a pet if you if you told me he", "64:32", "said hey man I went into Tanzania I went", "64:35", "into you know the wildest part and", "64:38", "backpack tin and set up camp and I was", "64:42", "there for 40 days and you know I killed", "64:44", "killed in a Plains game and I

"70:11", "like Swedish meatballs so he probably", "70:13", "and and he told us that the preparation", "70:16", "was intensive so he made a bath a whole", "70:19", "milk bath put the bear meat in it let it", "70:22", "sit for 10 hours dump the milk out put", "70:25", "more whole milk and he did that like", "70:26", "four or five times to just leach", "70:28", "anything that was in the meat

"75:56", "allow that disconnection they allow you", "75:59", "to to say hey we move past this now like", "76:01", "I can get my coffee at the corner you", "76:03", "know and and and it's go to Ethiopia", "76:05", "right yeah it's hard to argue right it's", "76:08", "hard to argue and we did a piece my", "76:11", "production company sick Manta we did a", "76:12", "piece a few years ago or last year for", "76:14", "epic meets I've ever heard of those guys", "76:16", "they do like high-end jerky and they do", "76:19", "like animal fats and they do bone broths", "76:21", "and things like that", "76:22", "anyway the owners were they make bars", "76:24", "yeah delicious yeah they're really", "76:27", "amazing so the owners were vegans they", "76:29", "are both vegans a

from their races and", "76:40", "they actually owned one of the largest", "76:42", "vegan food companies in the country and", "76:44", "they went to go see a friend who is a", "76:47", "medical doctor a friend of theirs and he", "76:49", "said hey look I think you guys need to", "76:51", "get some really high-end animal fats in", "76:55", "your systems to help your bodies recover", "76:57", "from these races and they started doing", "77:00", "that and their symptoms", "77:01", "you know like their soreness whether it", "77:02", "be back pain hip knees I'm assuming that", "77:05", "was all from the races started to go", "77:08", "away almost instantly so they started", "77:10", "kind of delving into their psyche and in", "77:13", "their questions and they started kind of", "77:16", "revisiting their philosophies if you", "77:18", "will and and I don't wanna get the story", "77:20", "wrong but I think while they still owned", "77:22", "the vegan food company they", "77:23", "started epic meets and they thought can", "77:26", "we find meat that has responsibly grown", "77:28", "and sourced for people that don't want", "77:30", "to kill it themselves and and they went", "77:33", "down that road they ended up actually", "77:34", "selling the vegan food company off", "77:36", "because uh people found out that they", "77:38", "owned both and I think there is", "77:40", "obviously some problems there yeah but", "77:44", "they but they just found really good", "77:47", "source to meat and they do all feel the", "77:50", "harvest and so we did a we did a", "77:51", "commercial production for them a", "77:52", "branding piece for them to kind of", "77:54", "highlight how they treat their animals", "77:56", "and how they kill their animals because", "77:57", "they kill them rather than putting them", "77:59", "on a truck and loading them into", "78:01", "Corral's and doing that whole thing they", "78:03", "literally drive out with the same", "78:05", "tractor that they feed them with and", "78:06", "they've had them on huge pastures so if", "78:08", "they're actually reclaiming the ground", "78:10", "and it's really cool and they when they", "78:12", "do ranches they'll go in and test all", "78:14", "the soils of these ranches and the", "78:16", "grasses and then they'll retest them", "78:18", "after one year three years five years", "78:20", "and they're finding even better soils", "78:21", "and better grasses animals have spent", "78:23", "time there because they're doing more", "78:25", "fertilizing and the grasses are being", "78:27", "reclaimed and then they shoot the animal", "78:30", "in the head with a high-powered rifle", "78:31", "and so they do just lights out boom done", "78:33", "and then that's how they butcher them so", "78:35", "so they do it about as ethically and", "78:37", "humanely as you can kill an animal as", "78:40", "you can kill an animal that's being", "78:41", "raised in a pen what was that place in", "78:44", "LA was it called Harmony Cafe is that", "78:46", "what it was called what was the place", "78:47", "where the people would own dit gratitude", "78:50", "Cafe Gratitude right that's right there", "78:52", "was a place in LA that was owned by", "78:55", "these people it still is but they were", "78:57", "vegans for a long time and they were", "79:00", "having health issues as well and they", "79:02", "decided to butcher their own animals and", "79:04", "start raising their own animals and", "79:05", "butchering them and I think they wrote", "79:07", "about it on a blog and they were just", "79:10", "trying to explain themselves and vegans", "79:12", "went fucking crazy the people that owned", "79:13", "the restaurant went crazy and they got a", "79:14", "bunch of death threats and yeah and it", "79:16", "became this giant issue with them it's", "79:19", "you know I I get where they're coming", "79:22", "from they don't they they have this", "79:24", "rigid idea of what's happening and they", "79:26", "don't want an animal to die so that they", "79:28", "can live I get it but their perception", "79:31", "of the the ethical purity of they're", "79:34", "deciding to just eat vegetables", "79:37", "and and the actual the actual health", "79:39", "consequences in terms of like how many", "79:41", "people can get by and what your your", "79:44", "physical dietary

vegetarian world they", "80:14", "want us to think that we are basically", "80:17", "herbivores and that we can get by and", "80:19", "then our desire to consume meat is just", "80:21", "because of the sickness that we have and", "80:23", "this is this evil nature that you know", "80:26", "human beings sometimes are possessed by", "80:28", "but it's just it's just not true yeah", "80:30",

they were just", "99:39", "always present like even I would go", "99:41", "hiking just to get some exercise and", "99:43", "literally three or four of them would go", "99:44", "with me and they'd hang back like 50 60", "99:47", "yards behind me but I'd hike for like", "99:48", "ten miles and I they do the whole thing", "99:50", "with me and return back to camp with me", "99:53", "and then it

you know some of your guys", "100:59", "beliefs you know fall that your", "101:01", "ancestors move on into the animal", "101:03", "kingdom right and they're like yeah and", "101:04", "I said well is there a chance that some", "101:06", "of these wolves could be some of your", "101:07", "ancestors you know and I know that's not", "101:10", "true at least I think I know that's not", "101:13", "true but they're like yeah yeah so I", "101:14", "just was trying to convince his ex they", "101:16", "wanted to blast these things and so I", "101:17", "just convinced him not to shoot the", "101:19",

"101:24", "kind of been probably a good way to", "101:26", "rationalize I steered them down a path", "101:28", "of worse might have gone anyway yeah and", "101:31", "so but I spent time with those wolves", "101:33", "and I've had you know and the idea of", "101:37", "management like when we were in the", "101:40", "short that Jamie is just playing who we", "101:42", "are that we played you can see some", "101:43", "wolves in there and a few years ago I", "101:44", "got surrounded by a pack of wolves", "101:46", "in the Arctic with the crew and it", "101:48", "filmed really beautifully and

definitely", "101:58", "looking at us as though are we food", "102:02", "right so this that was one of them but", "102:04", "we had like six or seven wolves come in", "102:06", "behind us so this wolf would be in front", "102:09", "of us two or three others would be", "102:10", "behind us but you can see they're not", "102:12", "attacking us they're not even hunting us", "102:14", "but you can just see like they're", "102:15", "wondering you know is there is there a", "102:18", "play here right is there is there a play", "102:20", "here and and and I've and I and I mean", "102:24", "it's I'm not being a tough guy there", "102:25", "wasn't an ounce that I didn't have eight", "102:28", "not a fiber of my body was afraid at any", "102:31", "point and there's probably six seven", "102:32", "wolves around us within ten yards all", "102:35", "and they're communicating they're doing", "102:37", "this little like so they're talking to", "102:40", "each other and then they just moved off", "102:42", "and it turns out that the Moose that I", "102:45", "was stalking I think they were stalking", "102:46", "too there was a big bowl that was bedded", "102:49", "and if they weren't stalking him because", "102:52", "I think they would have had their hands", "102:53", "full with him", "102:54", "but if they weren't stalking him then", "102:56", "they were just moving in that general",

I've", "103:06", "always had time with them I've always", "103:08", "had time in them I've always been I've", "103:10", "had wolf tags in my pocket before you", "103:12", "know this kind of falls under the same", "103:15", "idea of conservation like these wolves", "103:17", "right here right I had a wolf tag in my", "103:19", "pocket at my bow I could have arrowed", "103:21", "any of these wolves easily multiples of", "103:23", "them probably but I don't want to kill a", "103:26", "wolf here because I you know they know", "103:29", "when another wolf is gone right the pack", "103:31",

"103:43", "like I didn't have I didn't do my", "103:45", "homework for this area so just like I", "103:47", "don't know if there's a lot of little", "103:49", "wolves I'm not gonna kill a wolf I know", "103:50", "interest in killing wolf I get a wolf", "103:52", "tag with my stuff right now that was", "103:54", "telling me that there's a one of the", "103:56", "explorers that traveled the

would", "104:09", "have a real hard time", "104:10", "I just couldn't they're too much like", "104:13", "dogs yeah they're I think there's some", "104:15", "sort of a genetic memory that we have of", "104:18", "our relationship with wolves and they", "104:20", "mean they've become dogs and they've", "104:21", "become our you know our companions and", "104:25", "they become a part of our community yeah", "104:28", "it just wasn't you know it wasn't for me", "104:31", "and when the pilot picked me up he asked", "104:33", "me that I'd seen any wolves and I said", "104:34", "yeah we saw a lot of wolves and he's", "104:36", "like all there now you know he's not I'm", "104:39", "not telling you he's running surveys", "104:40", "here he's like yeah there's a lot of", "104:41", "wolves here there's a lot of predation", "104:42", "on on moose here so we're trying to", "104:44", "we're trying to really cut the wolves", "104:46", "down here but and I saw a lot of wolves", "104:48", "but I also saw a ton of moose and I saw", "104:50", "a ton of cows and I saw lots of calves", "104:53", "and lots of big bulls so everything", "104:55", "seemed to be functioning in that area", "104:57", "and I also saw a ton of read-back voles", "105:00", "right they look like mice with little", "105:02", "short tails and I know where there's a", "105:03", "lot of read-back voles I know that", "105:05", "wolves do extremely well eating them and", "105:07", "so you see these little tunnels in the", "105:10", "tundra and stuff and I think wolves eat", "105:13", "a lot smaller of prey than people think", "105:15", "on average right we see sensational", "105:17", "things of small dogs or wolves and we", "105:21", "filmed I don't know if it did you see", "105:22", "the dingo hunt that we filmed in", "105:24", "Australia no oh my god no we were", "105:28", "hunting Buffalo and while we were", "105:31", "hunting Buffalo dingoes just exploded", "105:33", "from the bush and the dingoes

immediately", "105:43", "from Australia we had pigs a dingo small", "105:48", "tiny dude so we filmed all that's not", "105:50", "straight it's literally never been", "105:51", "filmed before to our knowledge everyone", "105:53", "that we talked to that is Singhal", "105:55", "researchers they want to know exactly", "105:56", "where this was never seen this behavior", "105:58", "and see this behavior right here that", "106:00", "was I'm actually coming in to hunt us", "106:01", "but you can see the whole crew sat down", "106:04", "everybody was totally committed they're", "106:06", "trying to kill that calf right there and", "106:08", "still that calf is monstrous right so", "106:11", "there's four or five six on there and", "106:13", "then they chase they", "106:14", "the whole herd directly write in to us", "106:17", "that's what you're seeing right here and", "106:19", "that the herd actually comes to like 15", "106:21", "feet before they split around us we're", "106:22", "all sitting on our butts and then the", "106:24", "dingoes actually turned their attention", "106:26", "to us and they come in around us because", "106:29", "you can see us instantly looking at us", "106:31", "as a were a meal but like wolves like", "106:33", "grizzly bears like black bears very", "106:36", "quickly they looking at a guy asses not", "106:39", "gonna work out for me yeah they

successful in the on the", "106:57", "calf you know and the idea is that", "107:00", "they're gonna chase them and wear them", "107:01", "out and that one of the calves gonna be", "107:03", "separating they gonna take it down yeah", "107:04", "but they're like 35 pounds that's so", "107:07", "crazy it's such a small animal and these", "107:09", "calves even the calves are probably like",

and", "120:14", "get them to understand what they've done", "120:15", "by making this hunt illegal but what I", "120:19", "would like to see is people also be", "120:21", "educated on the fact like what you said", "120:23", "that these animals are actually edible", "120:25", "and that instead maybe the part of the", "120:28", "problem is the fact that these people", "120:29", "are just taking the head in the hide and", "120:31", "leaving behind the meat and if you were", "120:33", "responsible for not just taking the meat", "120:36", "but showing that you're consuming it and", "120:38",

head out last that's", "121:19", "how we do it the head goes out last", "121:20", "because it's the least of importance it", "121:22", "holds the least importance and so with a", "121:24", "hide in the head go out last so and if", "121:27", "you take a picture of a backpack full of", "121:29", "meat it looks like a backpack because", "121:31", "the meats inside so it looks like you're",

to like 11,000 feet send cain't son", "138:42", "came up and there was a huge calque at", "138:44", "30 yards and I shot her when I was like", "138:46", "alright that's done and so I cut her up", "138:50", "cleaned her up and I just had always", "138:52", "went to Alaska during September and not", "138:55", "in the elk mountains and finally I was", "138:57", "just like I need to do this and it was", "138:58", "awesome I had a I had a good and bad", "139:01", "experience great experience with like", "139:04", "the morning that I killed was", "139:05", "sensational misty rainy the Bulls were", "139:08", "screaming everything was very wild we", "139:10", "were way back in there was really", "139:12", "sensational really really impactful but", "139:15", "up to that point the area that I was", "139:17", "hunting the Shell Creek range in Nevada", "139:18", "is they only have a few tags there but", "139:22", "when you get a tag everyone he hires", "139:25", "basically all of their

you", "139:46", "should have to leave all your motorized", "139:48", "vehicles on pavement and go into the", "139:50", "mountains on foot that's my opinion but", "139:52", "this area that I was in they had", "139:55", "something like 400 miles of improved", "140:00", "two-track roads that guys had literally", "140:03", "just like they see something over here", "140:04", "they want to get to you they just start", "140:06", "driving they're side by side right", "140:07", "across the sagebrush and they just start", "140:09", "beating this stuff down and pretty soon", "140:11", "there's a road and so this area started", "140:13", "out I'll just make these numbers up", "140:14", "because I don't remember the but they", "140:16", "start out like a hundred miles of dirt", "140:18", "roads in this mountain system quickly", "140:20", "expanded to four hundred miles of dirt", "140:23", "roads because people just trying to", "140:24", "access wherever they want to go with an", "140:26", "ATV really started to impact the elk to", "140:29", "where they they were getting pushed out", "140:31", "of their winter ranges by people on ATVs", "140:34", "and they're getting bullied so badly by", "140:37", "people that were accessing the air by", "140:39", "ATV that they just recently closed on", "140:41", "something like 200 miles roads and I", "140:43", "think they're trying to even close down", "140:44", "even more but as far as I'm concerned it", "140:46", "should be closed down if you want to go", "140:48", "and do if you want to go and ride your", "140:50", "ATV go ride your ATV if you're all", "140:52", "cunning leave the ATV on the road right", "140:54", "and by ATV you're talking about like", "140:56", "those little Rangers so yeah mostly", "140:58", "mostly side by side there are a couple", "140:59", "of quads but mostly side by side yeah", "141:01", "yeah those those are very very", "141:04", "controversial we were in Nevada a couple", "141:07", "years back in the

using them illegally they're", "141:24", "driving into these areas where you know", "141:26", "you're off the road and you're just just", "141:29", "driving through these open plains areas", "141:31",

well you", "141:43", "know it's not the worst thing in the", "141:45", "world in terms of like if you need to", "141:47", "get an animal out of there I kind of", "141:49", "agree with it but I kind of understand", "141:50", "your point", "141:51", "maybe you shouldn't even be able to do", "141:53", "it with that mm-hmm cuz because then", "141:55", "you're gonna look I mean it's gonna be", "141:57",

and you", "148:28", "and you keep truncating down the", "148:31", "information you keep taking steps into", "148:32", "the world and it's down until you find", "148:34", "this really massive bowl you slip in you", "148:37", "have the wind right you're hidden in the", "148:39", "bush or up against a rock or and here he", "148:41", "comes and you can't believe it you've", "148:43", "done your homework and you've truncated", "148:44", "on this experience and here he comes and", "148:46", "you come to a full draw and he for", "148:48", "whatever reason stops at 30 yards and", "148:50", "you find your pin you just and you watch", "148:52", "your arrows zip right through them and", "148:53", "you know you're looking around for", "148:55", "somebody to tell it's just a huge", "148:56",

"149:17", "everyone can relate to that or people", "149:19", "that have done this can relate to that", "149:20", "so when they show you their pictures or", "149:22", "200-inch Ram all their buddies go oh man", "149:25", "what all how it all might a song right", "149:28", "and really has no needs no interest in", "149:30", "that whatsoever like that is literally", "149:32", "just to build a resume same with a big", "149:34", "maned lion right you know if you went in", "149:36", "and dil de it was a truly wilderness", "149:38", "experience you really did your homework", "149:40", "and I know I'm splitting hairs here but", "149:42", "this is how my mind works", "149:43", "tell me the story I'd love to hear it", "149:45", "but if it's anything other than that", "149:47", "then it's not for me well that's the", "149:50", "thing about you what you're saying", "149:52", "mirrors what I hear from guys like Steve", "149:55", "Rinella and people that are really", "149:57", "accomplished hunters that are very", "149:59", "ethical and have the right mindset is", "150:02", "that this is supposed to be difficult", "150:04", "hard", "150:05", "yeah the experience is supposed to be", "150:07", "you're supposed to hike all those miles", "150:09", "you're supposed to go up and down those", "150:10", "mountains it's supposed to be exhausting", "150:12", "it's supposed to be hard to get close to", "150:14", "one of these creatures it's supposed to", "150:15", "be difficult you're supposed to not know", "150:17", "what's over the next ridge yeah it's", "150:19", "suppose that it's part of the reward and", "150:21", "if that reward isn't there it's like", "150:23", "shooting fish in a barrel shooting fish", "150:25", "in a barrel is weird it's not", "150:27", "interesting at all and it's great if you", "150:29", "definitely need a fish", "150:31", "yeah yeah yeah and that's okay like", "150:33", "there's there are little you know you", "150:35", "can cut little corners in life right", "150:37", "like you know it's I'm not saying", "150:40", "everything has to be like cuz because", "150:41", "then somebody might say well you're", "150:43", "using a compound bow the other guys", "150:45", "using a recurve well right it's a good", "150:47", "argument it's an argument gets weird", "150:49", "right but if you're doing it we say if", "150:51", "you're doing it well and good it doesn't", "150:54", "matter you know it shouldn't matter like", "150:56", "if you are an ethical if you're hunting", "150:57", "for the right reasons you're asking", "150:59", "yourself these big questions it", "151:00", "shouldn't matter if you pick up a rifle", "151:02", "and you shoot them out a hundred yards", "151:04", "or you pick up a recurve and you shoot", "151:06", "them at ten yards because I I know", "151:08", "recurve shooters I can only shoot like", "151:10", "15 18 yards I know recurve shooters that", "151:12", "can shoot 50 60 70 yards and you know so", "151:17", "we're all different we all like to you", "151:19", "know some people really enjoy shooting", "151:20", "the rifle some people really enjoy", "151:22", "shooting their bow I don't think we", "151:23", "should split hairs there just realize", "151:25", "that the bow hunter maybe had to do go", "151:28", "to the the next level of immersion to", "151:31", "get himself next to an animal and and", "151:32", "you know on the rifle hunter you know", "151:35", "there you know there's a slightly less", "151:37", "barrier of entry but it doesn't mean it", "151:39", "there's anything wrong with it", "151:40", "well rifle I've had heard it argue and I", "151:42", "agree with them that rifle hunting on", "151:44", "public land is probably more difficult", "151:46", "than bow hunting on private land without", "151:49", "question and certainly more difficult", "151:51", "than bow hunting on public land because", "151:53", "ball owners have this the reason I", "151:56", "started ball hunting was to have access", "151:58", "to public land prior to the rifle season", "152:00", "yeah to extend my season to go in the", "152:03", "woods when it's quiet no one else's", "152:05", "around and see animals acting be", "152:07", "naturally rather than seeing this orange", "152:09", "army right seeing everything running for", "152:11", "its life right right yeah yeah that's", "152:14", "where it gets squirrely right I mean the", "152:15", "does public access is great but man it", "152:18", "does get really weird and I've", "152:19", "experienced it when there's a lot of", "152:21", "hunters around it gets really like I was", "152:22", "in Wisconsin for opening day a couple", "152:25", "years ago and it is like a war zone the", "152:28", "moment light goes off you hear boom mmm", "152:33", "and I was I was with Rinella we filmed", "152:35", "it from meat-eater and I was like what", "152:37", "the fuck is going on man", "152:39", "war he's like this is opening day in", "152:42", "Wisconsin I was like that's crazy yeah I", "152:44", "mean it is just everywhere just gunshots", "152:49", "ringing out in the distance yep", "152:51", "and again like you know sometimes we", "152:54", "like to talk about management not every", "152:55", "not every population needs to be managed", "152:57", "but literally you probably can't kill", "153:00", "enough deer that day in Wisconsin you", "153:02", "better manage this fuck yeah because", "153:04", "people are hitting them with cars all", "153:05", "day long yeah you literally couldn't", "153:07", "kill enough and we were eating them they", "153:09", "were they were eating a lot of corn", "153:10", "because where my friend Doug Durin's", "153:12", "farm is where we were hunting it's all", "153:14", "corn yeah and man they could not have", "153:16", "tasted better yeah they were so good", "153:19", "yeah it was insane we sauteed them that", "153:21", "night in a cast-iron skillet with garlic", "153:25", "salt and butter and holy shit was it", "153:28", "good yeah it's like we're just moaning", "153:30", "and orgasmic ecstasy while they're", "153:32", "eating this dear its cuisine man it's so", "153:35", "good you know and you're sitting there", "153:36", "with your bodies yeah it's it's it", "153:38", "should be and it's value freezing cold", "153:41", "outside you're indoors and it's warm and", "153:44", "everybody's happy man it was epic", "153:47", "as epic it's something to be told yeah", "153:50", "it is something to be told I think and", "153:53", "we should probably wrap this up we're", "153:54", "about three hours in but I think I would", "153:56", "want people if they've really curious", "153:58", "about this endeavor", "154:01", "I really would want people to start with", "154:03", "your films because I appreciate that I", "154:05", "think that what you're doing if they", "154:06", "have the time to sit down and watch that", "154:08", "whole thing what you're doing is you I", "154:10", "think you represent the best just the", "154:14", "best slice it's so hard to get that", "154:17", "slice in 22 minutes", "154:18", "and I think Rinella does an amazing job", "154:20", "in doing it in 22 minutes but I think", "154:23", "what you're what you've done by turning", "154:25", "these into films and by really giving", "154:29", "yourself the opportunity to relay your", "154:32", "appreciation the Wonder and the awe of", "154:34", "nature and your immersion into that", "154:37", "world and to do so in such an incredibly", "154:41", "creative way and beautifully visually", "154:45", "stunning way that I think you've done an", "154:48", "amazing service and I think I think it's", "154:50", "a great place for people to start", "154:52", "to get a look at them and for people", "154:54", "that do hunt I think they'll really", "154:55", "appreciate if they haven't seen your", "154:57", "stuff before I appreciate that man like", "154:59", "it's we definitely suffer for the work", "155:02", "like writing the music the shooting it", "155:06", "like we do we want to represent", "155:08", "ourselves with absolute purity but we", "155:11", "also
