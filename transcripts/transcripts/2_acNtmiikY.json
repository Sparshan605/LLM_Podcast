discourage you", "122:15", "from doing it and make it difficult for", "122:17", "you to do it for you to switch over to", "122:18", "electric because he had his installed", "122:21", "and hooked up four months before it got", "122:24", "switched on with the grid it was like a", "122:26", "real issue and then even more so I think", "122:28", "if you want to go off-grid", "122:30", "so you can use
