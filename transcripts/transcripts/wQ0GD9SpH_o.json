bit", "08:28", "saying okay we don't say he shouldn't", "08:30", "have gotten it we don't say he didn't", "08:32", "deserve it but and then they had to try", "08:34", "to figure out some way to because it's", "08:35", "all got to be about politics now so they", "08:37", "bring it back to the current president", "08:39", "the Trump", "08:39", "whenever Trump does anything even if", "08:41", "what he does is fantastic they can't get", "08:43", "behind it they almost have to get a go", "08:45", "against things that are great like if", "08:47", "the economy is great they've got to find",

"civil conversations anymore but but the", "09:07", "idea that we can look at and and", "09:09", "separate the politics from it look I", "09:10", "know again I don't care whether people", "09:12", "like Trump or not I don't you know I", "09:14", "didn't vote for him I don't mean", "09:16", "necessarily care for the individual but", "09:17", "that doesn't mean I can't like policies", "09:20", "right and whether you're talking about", "09:21", "what's going on with Iran were they", "09:23", "talking about you know the way that", "09:24", "we've been dealing with China lately", "09:25", "other issues I you know hey I liked I", "09:28", "liked President Obama didn't like his", "09:32", "policies you know I don't necessarily", "09:34", "like Trump I liked his policies I don't", "09:37", "see any conflict there yeah anyway no I", "09:39", "don't see any conflict there a billion", "09:40", "people are complicated and I just I just", "09:43", "didn't know that Trump could make the", "09:44", "call guy that goes take him out like", "09:47", "when when when I thought that was like", "09:49", "there was probably a panel of military", "09:52", "leaders and like really important people", "09:54", "that understand the ramifications not a", "09:56", "fucking game show yeah like in America's", "09:58", "Got Talent or people buzzer I felt like", "10:03", "that would be like something that they", "10:05", "would discuss Trump and be like yeah", "10:07", "option three welcome well but they talk", "10:09", "about and there is a great deal of", "10:10", "conversation that goes I'm not", "10:11", "necessarily with the president you know", "10:13", "I have no idea how he processes his", "10:16", "information but there's a great deal of", "10:18", "the conversation a discussion that goes", "10:20", "on in the Pentagon within the Intel", "10:21", "community and National Security Council", "10:23", "you know what happens once they lay out", "10:26", "these options in front of the president", "10:27", "you know I don't have a clue but he does", "10:31", "have that authority he's got that", "10:33", "ability in President Obama had that", "10:34", "authority President Obama took out", "10:35", "remember you know US citizens you know", "10:38", "who would yes over season in the Middle", "10:40", "East and you know there was a hue and", "10:43", "cry over sort of the the legality of it", "10:45", "but you didn't see a lot of people", "10:47", "saying you know and in part okay I admit", "10:50", "because it wasn't again this you know", "10:52", "sulemani is wrapped in a cloak of his", "10:54", "military uniform it's also people are", "10:56", "very concerned about this possibility of", "10:57", "what's going on war with Iran and they", "10:59", "think that this might have like started", "11:01", "that off yeah yeah I think what changed", "11:05", "the calculus here", "11:06", "is Iran is you know the regime is brutal", "11:10", "and and on an awful they're not crazy", "11:12", "and the one thing they want more than", "11:15", "anything else is to retain power that's", "11:16", "it and I think they looked at the idea", "11:18", "of a military conflict a direct military", "11:21", "conflict with the US and this is not to", "11:22", "say that their proxies won't you know", "11:24", "strike out it at some place around the", "11:25", "world at some point but the regime", "11:29", "looked at that thought net you know what", "11:31", "we're not going to do this in in part", "11:33", "because you know the killing of sulemani", "11:35", "is is important on a much bigger level", "11:37", "than just taking out you know a a", "11:40", "terrorist of his stature it's important", "11:44", "for deterrence purposes and so you know", "11:47", "I again I think they looked and felt", "11:49", "like the calculus and dealing with the", "11:51", "US has shifted now and they don't", "11:53", "understand it they're not comfortable", "11:55", "with it and also they can't afford it", "11:56", "look what if we got in the military", "11:58", "conflict over this the idea that you", "12:00", "know somehow we were gonna get in World", "12:01", "War three it would be over in an evening", "12:03", "literally it would be over in one night", "12:05", "we have the ability to take out their", "12:07", "entire energy infrastructure there are", "12:10", "missile bases there are key military", "12:13", "facilities and I don't want to", "12:15", "oversimplify this but after that first", "12:18", "night's activity that's it they're done", "12:20", "so the idea that somehow there's going", "12:22", "to be now does that mean that you know", "12:24", "we should do that of course not nobody", "12:25", "wants a military conflict but you know", "12:29", "and again there would be knock-on", "12:31", "repercussions excetera", "12:32", "so hopefully we can sort this thing out", "12:34", "through now that we're doing the", "12:36", "military deterrence and they understand", "12:38", "that we're serious we've got the", "12:40", "economic pressures we've got diplomatic", "12:41", "pressure primarily to keep them isolated", "12:43", "I think you know I think we're on the", "12:46", "right track with with Iran I think want", "12:48", "to see a different reaction from them", "12:49", "well I was a little bit relieved when", "12:51", "they attacked back and just sort of like", "12:54", "launched missiles on the outside of", "12:56", "bases nobody died I was like okay so it", "12:59", "seems like this is almost like they're", "13:01", "they're making a signal like they're", "13:04", "attacking but they're not really doing", "13:05", "anything yeah I think there was an optic", "13:08", "to it I think you're right absolutely", "13:09", "that they felt like they had to do", "13:11", "something yeah the ayatollahs gathered I", "13:13", "don't know what they call it saving face", "13:14", "or not but you know and then we had a", "13:17", "warning we had warning ahead of time", "13:19", "and didn't they print in their paper", "13:20", "didn't they say that they killed a bunch", "13:22", "of people they did yeah so talk yeah", "13:24", "they claimed about eighty or so I think", "13:25", "keep saying it right exactly just", "13:27", "whatever it takes but didn't I mean you", "13:29", "know and to put a look at the reaction", "13:31", "that we've had they'd you know of course", "13:32", "the Ukrainian commercial passenger jet", "13:36", "went down yeah", "13:38", "and that was them right oh that was that", "13:40", "was definitely them when do you think", "13:43", "that they shot it down because they", "13:44", "thought it was a US military plan yeah", "13:46", "it was an it look this is it", "13:47", "this it's not unprecedented I mean we", "13:49", "shut down an Iranian passenger jet years", "13:51", "and years ago right the Russians shot", "13:53", "down they still won't admit to it but", "13:55", "they shot down a passenger jet over", "13:57", "Ukraine what just a handful of years ago", "14:01", "at which they still won't admit to its", "14:04", "it's human error and it's human error in", "14:07", "a conflict zone and in a situation where", "14:09", "there's there's a lot of moving parts", "14:10", "and it's never gonna be a zero risk game", "14:13", "so if the Iranians had done this as", "14:15", "tragic as it is and come out and said oh", "14:17", "my god we you know did this okay well", "14:20", "this you know it would have been", "14:22", "horrific but they you know they did this", "14:26", "to themselves they did because they just", "14:27", "couldn't bring themselves to be truthful", "14:29", "they've got a long track record of not", "14:31", "and so they they engaged in this and and", "14:35", "shot it down I there's when you find", "14:38", "missile debris in a in a in a field", "14:42", "where you're doing an investigation of a", "14:43", "plane crash that's pretty good", "14:45", "indication and then there's the video on", "14:47", "top of that well there is a video the", "14:49", "missile hitting the plane they have two", "14:50", "missiles oh Jesus Christ", "14:52", "thirty second support roughly thirty", "14:53", "seconds apart so two missiles to bring", "14:56", "down a plane yeah hit the first one the", "14:59", "first one hit and then about thirty", "15:02", "seconds later not quite 30 things later", "15:03", "a second missile hits there's another", "15:06", "fireball and the plane stays up in the", "15:08", "air for you know a period of time just", "15:11", "because it's just it's not devastated", "15:13", "but it's it it was some twenty miles", "15:16", "from the airport it actually kind of", "15:18", "made up as if it was turning back to the", "15:20", "airport probably right after that first", "15:22", "missile hit but here's the thing I mean", "15:26", "that was so that's a tragic disaster", "15:28", "right there right but the idea that you", "15:29", "know somehow nobody nobody's actually", "15:31", "saying they did it on purpose", "15:32", "they didn't do it on purpose they did it", "15:33", "it was an accident they mistook it for", "15:35", "either an incoming missile or a hostile", "15:38", "aircraft you know coming in for bombing", "15:40", "run after they launched their ballistic", "15:43", "missile strike so nobody's saying it was", "15:46", "done on purpose but it's it's it again", "15:52", "it's it's indicative of the", "15:55", "Revolutionary Guard Force and the regime", "15:58", "itself that they spent several days", "16:00", "denying it and saying it was mechanical", "16:03", "failure and pressuring the Ukrainians to", "16:05", "come out and say it was mechanical", "16:06", "failure which they then reversed course", "16:08", "on that once it became obvious yeah so", "16:11", "it's a tragic situation but now the", "16:14", "protests out in the streets of Iran", "16:16", "which are a continuation of the past", "16:17", "several months right which were targeted", "16:19", "at a corrupt regime have picked up", "16:22", "strength in light of that because the", "16:24", "people are just we're tired of this you", "16:26", "know so and who knows where it's going", "16:29", "to go I suspect unfortunately I'm fairly", "16:30", "cynical about all this we've been hoping", "16:32", "the Iranian population would kind of", "16:34", "rise up for decades and it doesn't", "16:37", "happen because it's a pretty brutal", "16:39", "regime we don't understand that we don't", "16:41", "understand how how how difficult they", "16:44", "are right and how serious minded they", "16:46", "are about holding on to power so every", "16:48", "now and then we think okay how come the", "16:49", "protest it's gonna topple the regime and", "16:51", "it doesn't happen so maybe it's", "16:53", "different this time", "16:54", "I'd you know I don't think so mm-hmm now", "16:57", "were you concerned at all and this is", "16:59", "one of the things when you say that we", "17:01", "could go in there and level them in a", "17:03", "day the the real issue is they're allies", "17:06", "right the real issue is China and Russia", "17:09", "yeah but they're not gonna do anything", "17:11", "China and Russia aren't got do anything", "17:13", "it's not in their best

it's", "31:08", "interesting because I think that someone", "31:10", "who supports big business the way Trump", "31:12", "does he encourages people to to move", "31:16", "business forward I mean it encourages", "31:18", "the market encourages people to spend", "31:20", "money it encourages people to take risks", "31:22", "if the the more he makes it easier for", "31:25", "these big businesses

records and you know", "68:45", "what they were asking for and then they", "68:49", "went to Apple I think just a week ago or", "68:51", "so with requests for assistance with a", "68:54", "second one they subpoenaed Apple a", "68:56", "couple days later said you know we need", "68:57", "assistance getting into these phones I'm", "68:59", "still the same problem that they had you", "69:00", "know three or four years ago but the San", "69:03", "Bernardino yes", "69:04", "and so we had that big you know", "69:07", "kerfuffle where they were you know", "69:08", "saying like apples not assisting

these phones", "69:19", "anyway so bill Barr the Attorney General", "69:21", "came out just you know yesterday past", "69:23", "couple of days and he's been lambasted", "69:24", "apples saying you

the fuck we are providing some", "69:33", "assistance so it's it we're back in that", "69:34", "same thing that we were in four years", "69:36", "ago where you got this battle over", "69:37", "access and and you know pushing an", "69:39", "investigation forward and the concern", "69:42", "over privacy what did they want that", "69:44", "Apple's not willing to provide well they", "69:46", "want access to the phones", "69:47", "you know the idea was initially they", "69:49", "were trying to get backup", "69:51", "sorry a a backdoor in that could be used", "69:54", "by law enforcement to get into the the", "69:56", "iPhone so see in here Trump wants Apple", "69:58", "to unlock the Pensacola shooters iPhones", "70:00", "here's why it won't what is that well", "70:03", "first of all this is CNN which is", "70:04", "strychnos it's all phone it says we have", "70:09", "always maintained there's no such thing", "70:11", "as a backdoor just for the good guys", "70:12", "backdoors can be exploited by those who", "70:15", "threaten our national security and the", "70:16", "data security of our customers Apple", "70:18", "added today law enforcement has access", "70:21", "to more data

one thing that like", "70:39", "backdoors but I'm not talking about a", "70:40", "backdoor I'm talking about like there", "70:42", "should be a way that they can get into", "70:44", "the", "70:44", "phone right there should be a way that", "70:47", "you can not just the iCloud backup but", "70:48", "you could open up the phone and do it", "70:52", "with like the Apple should have like", "70:53", "some some skeleton key or something like", "70:56", "that well that's and that's what the", "70:57", "that's what they're saying they're not", "70:58", "gonna provide they're not gonna provide", "70:59", "its software solution to allow them", "71:01", "access to get into these phones but what", "71:03", "else could he have on his phone if it's", "71:04", "iCloud backed up like an iCloud backup", "71:07", "is essentially your phone but it's in", "71:09", "the cloud right but you can also turn", "71:11", "that off", "71:12", "so if just but have they turned it off", "71:14", "has he turned it off yeah I don't know", "71:15", "the details of that but I would have", "71:17", "suspect so but there's other data that", "71:18", "you can access from that phone that", "71:20", "would be relevant to this now that you", "71:22", "know I tend to in this situation I tend", "71:24", "to side with with Apple I understand the", "71:27", "Attorney General you know his", "71:28", "responsibility is whatever protecting", "71:31", "American citizens so that okay that's", "71:32", "he's gonna have this position but you", "71:36", "know apples basically saying look we're", "71:37", "not going to we're not gonna break the", "71:39", "terms of our contract with all the", "71:41", "people that have iPhones we're we're you", "71:43", "know providing them with privacy and", "71:44", "they're also I think saying to some", "71:47", "degree look yeah we understand that you", "71:49", "know criminals can use encryption right", "71:50", "I mean they do right they take advantage", "71:53", "of the encryption that's available in", "71:54", "the lack of access but so to millions of", "71:57", "citizens right who use the iPhones just", "71:59", "to keep their bank records or whatever", "72:02", "they have on there right and and and so", "72:04", "it the encryption benefits everybody in", "72:06", "a sense obviously of benefits the", "72:07", "criminals now you know I think I also", "72:10", "kind of side with Apple at this point", "72:12", "because frankly I think technology has", "72:14", "kind of made some of these arguments", "72:15", "mood meaning that you know there's there", "72:18", "are ways to get into these phones now so", "72:20", "the bureau or the government doesn't", "72:22", "have to just go to Apple and say please", "72:25", "let us in there was boxes that the", "72:27", "police were buying that would allow you", "72:29", "to hack in the phones yeah there's", "72:31", "several companies that the companies", "72:33", "that are allowing or the developing", "72:35", "access or ability to access these phones", "72:38", "the competition's been increasing and", "72:39", "what happens you know people get better", "72:41", "at it and so they developed new", "72:42", "techniques and the thing the problem is", "72:44", "like bad guys can buy them so they can", "72:45", "get a hold of your phone steal your", "72:47", "phone from you and then I open it up and", "72:49", "then use your phone text people or get", "72:51", "weird yeah and so then what are you", "72:53", "saying we're saying okay well the", "72:54", "company that's got that access point", "72:55", "like like the Israeli company or some", "72:57", "others some several others out there", "72:58", "a gray shift and a few others said that", "73:01", "provide this so then you're relying on", "73:03", "them to control who they're selling to", "73:06", "and some of these companies sell only to", "73:07", "the government and to you know whoever", "73:09", "is DEA or you know and so I guess the", "73:12", "point being is it I don't think the old", "73:13", "arguments of even a few years ago that", "73:15", "says we can't get in so we need apples", "73:17", "assistance I think that's kind of going", "73:19", "by the wayside and you know the", "73:22", "government does have the ability to get", "73:23", "in there at this point so I'm not quite", "73:25", "sure why they've they're picking a fight", "73:27", "again I don't know all the details that", "73:29", "you know but I don't know what possibly", "73:30", "they can't get in the phone is that", "73:33", "possible cuz they're saying backdoors", "73:35", "can be exploited well okay but if you", "73:39", "give Apple a phone and say hang on the", "73:41", "password of this can you get in there", "73:43", "yeah you can get in the Apple can they", "73:45", "don't want to hand over that that", "73:46", "ability of that software because again", "73:48", "it's a it's a commercial issue right for", "73:49", "them", "73:50", "right but shouldn't it be possible if", "73:52", "they don't want to handle a a hand over", "73:55", "that software that they could just open", "73:57", "it for the government the government", "73:58", "doesn't have to get the software yeah", "73:59", "the government's made that argument to", "74:01", "them before doesn't for whatever reason", "74:03", "because I think it part is the optic", "74:05", "that says okay well apparently Apple's", "74:07", "willing to do this I think they just", "74:08", "want to hold the line and say absolutely", "74:10", "not because I think they're you know", "74:12", "they're looking at this from again from", "74:14", "almost a pure commercial perspective I", "74:16", "kind of understand that but then I kind", "74:18", "of say Bill this guy's a fucking", "74:19", "terrorist", "74:20", "shooter yeah okay I mean I yeah you've", "74:22", "you've you've got a contract with all", "74:24", "these people that says okay I'll protect", "74:26", "your privacy but you think that would be", "74:27", "you know your abdicating your ability to", "74:29", "hold them to that contract if you go out", "74:31", "and shoot a few people as the guys still", "74:33", "alive the shooter no okay so what's the", "74:35", "fucking problem he doesn't have any", "74:36", "privacy today yeah it's just I just find", "74:41", "it interesting we're back having that", "74:43", "same organ that we had a few years ago", "74:44", "right and we haven't and I think like I", "74:46", "said I'm not sure why Barr is pushing", "74:49", "this argument necessarily the way he is", "74:51", "I mean I get I get what his position has", "74:54", "to be given his job as Attorney General", "74:56", "but I think we're past that point I", "74:59", "think there's there's there's hacking", "75:02", "solutions that are legitimately", "75:03", "available through forensics groups that", "75:05", "have been developing these things they", "75:07", "can assist the government to do this so", "75:08", "it I just found it I found it", "75:10", "interesting it is interesting because", "75:12", "it's", "75:12", "like I gotta understand that Apple does", "75:14", "not want to open up too much to the", "75:16", "government's demands and if they do look", "75:18", "we don't have a tyrannical government", "75:21", "but what if we did I mean like what", "75:22", "what's going on with China and Huawei", "75:24", "it's like very similar if Apple sort of", "75:26", "opens up the door the government and", "75:27", "they slide right in and start really", "75:29", "using Apple's software to in their", "75:33", "phones to manipulate people and access", "75:35", "data that they really shouldn't have", "75:36", "access to people that aren't under", "75:38", "investigation and just like it opens up", "75:41", "the door to all sorts of other weird", "75:43", "possibilities yeah yeah well it's yeah", "75:45", "and it's it's it goes back and starts to", "75:47", "feed that belief that you know the", "75:48", "government's spying on everybody you", "75:50", "know the reality is they didn't either", "75:52", "have the resources or the interest", "75:53", "frankly or the ability to spy on", "75:55", "everybody well this is what I would say", "75:57", "to people like who's spying on you", "75:59", "there's another person so there's one", "76:01", "person that just buys on you all day so", "76:03", "a magic aside one person 300 million", "76:07", "people in this country there's 300", "76:08", "million spy spy you got one one target", "76:13", "that's all you do all day long is watch", "76:14", "one person one is the thing about them", "76:18", "collecting data like the NSA collecting", "76:20", "data and and collecting all your phone", "76:22", "calls collecting all your text messages", "76:24", "what's the big units bigger threat is", "76:26", "Amazon or Google or say oh you know what", "76:29", "you turn on your Samsung TV you know", "76:31", "what it's doing it's watching you don't", "76:34", "watch me your TV's got the ability to", "76:36", "watch it it's called up smart smart", "76:38", "interactivity yeah so it's got a camera", "76:41", "and the whole idea was well I will do", "76:42", "this so that we can figure out where", "76:43", "you're you know what you're watching and", "76:45", "what you think of it so now as you're", "76:47", "watching but it could listen yeah so you", "76:49", "know it's it's it's the commercial site", "76:51", "that's collecting information you know", "76:53", "not necessary for nefarious purposes", "76:55", "they're collecting it for marketing", "76:56", "purposes to make more money which is", "76:58", "what they're in business to do but", "76:59", "they're that they're the ones that are", "77:01", "hoovering up data right that that then", "77:03", "leaks out because somebody hacks grabs", "77:04", "all that information and then they use", "77:06", "it for something nefarious well I get", "77:08", "nervous when I hear about companies like", "77:10", "Facebook they're thinking about starting", "77:11", "their own cryptocurrency", "77:13", "mm-hmm and I'm like whoa whoa whoa whoa", "77:16", "you know I'm not a not believer but I", "77:22", "don't I'm not like invested in it", "77:26", "like something I'm but I had a guy on", "77:28", "several times Andreas Antonopoulos who's", "77:31", "a big Bitcoin expert is very very bright", "77:34", "an interesting guy and I really enjoyed", "77:35", "talking to him about it but he's all in", "77:37", "like he does all his banking with", "77:39", "bitcoins pays his rent with Bitcoin gets", "77:41", "paid with Bitcoin everything is Bitcoin", "77:43", "with him and you know he's loved by the", "77:46", "Bitcoin community and all this different", "77:48", "stuff but at the end of the day I just", "77:52", "don't totally understand how you can", "77:57", "have so many of them like how many", "77:59", "crypto currencies are there and then if", "78:01", "you don't have so many of them well", "78:02", "who's to say when you could stop making", "78:04", "them like right right who said I mean", "78:07", "who's the arbiter to say no that's", "78:09", "legitimate or that is not I don't know", "78:11", "I'm not I don't know I I'm I fall in the", "78:14", "category of I don't understand at heaven", "78:15", "I do be fair I've been taking the time", "78:17", "to understand it yeah and think about", "78:19", "everything this is my my take on it you", "78:21", "can't you don't have enough time to", "78:23", "think about everything so I'm letting", "78:24", "that one play out all right so I'm gonna", "78:26", "just sit back and when it's a hundred", "78:28", "percent when it's a hundred percent all", "78:30", "and when everybody's like look bitcoin", "78:32", "is it's just like money yeah okay", "78:34", "but until then and they kind of", "78:36", "predicted it was gonna be just like", "78:37", "money quite a few years ago and it never", "78:39", "really did hit that but you can buy some", "78:42", "things a Bitcoin there's some companies", "78:43", "that let you buy computers a Bitcoin", "78:45", "sure there's a fair amount of", "78:46", "transaction that goes on from what I", "78:47", "understand but again I don't I don't I", "78:48", "don't understand I don't see how it's", "78:50", "backed necessarily you know I'm sure", "78:52", "I'll probably get all sorts of comments", "78:53", "now like you know you're a fucking idiot", "78:54", "being heavily involved in Bitcoin but i", "78:57", "buy i buy gold bars and golds real", "78:59", "playing them out in the back i've been", "79:00", "telling people for gold forever exact", "79:02", "legit shit

anything", "111:00", "classified you're just looking for a", "111:01", "research paper or a study or something", "111:04", "you know and if they come back and say", "111:06", "yeah you know what here this isn't", "111:08", "interesting you know study you know and", "111:09", "they they now that act alone they're not", "111:11", "giving you something classified but that", "111:13", "act alone means something big right it", "111:15", "means there were tasks able in a sense", "111:18", "right they responded to your request for", "111:20", "information they're suckers not suckers", "111:22", "necessarily could be an enormous ly", "111:24", "smart person but you know and and smart", "111:27", "people get yeah they get you think it's", "111:29", "suckered into it I guess you could put",

it", "111:38", "maybe sometimes you know you've got a", "111:39", "shortened timeframe because there's a", "111:41", "requirement to get something and you got", "111:42", "to kind of accelerate the whole process", "111:44", "anyway so but I point being is it's tall", "111:47", "leverageable and Epstein was obviously", "111:48", "getting leverage on all these different", "111:50", "people for whatever his purpose was what", "111:52", "do you think that's what the question", "111:53", "was like what could he possibly a lot of", "111:55", "more scientists he went with a lot of", "111:57",

"112:29", "you haven't been compromising situations", "112:31", "and then they would do things for you", "112:32", "but what would they do for you yeah like", "112:34", "what yeah what is he getting bill cut", "112:36", "it's a good question and providing him", "112:38", "with access", "112:38", "maybe he liked being close to you know", "112:41", "the seat of power or maybe you know he", "112:43", "liked being close to what he thought was", "112:44", "like a royal family member you know", "112:46", "maybe who knows because he had Al's like", "112:48", "he had all the money he needed right so", "112:50", "maybe it was it was that sort of access", "112:52", "that that blue is skirt up I don't know", "112:54", "but it is yeah it is interesting but I", "112:59", "don't think I mean

fur-lined cell", "114:02", "Tony yeah science 72 inch TV wire marks", "114:15", "at his hands I mean if you're gonna get", "114:19", "someone to strangle your cellmate that's", "114:21", "the guy to I mean he's fuckin do it in", "114:23", "three seconds he's so big yeah you don't", "114:25", "want somebody who's got to take their", "114:26", "time because Kevin Spacey dude strangler", "114:29", "can take forever hold still want some", "114:32", "big gorilla dude yeah yeah well I tell", "114:35", "you what if if this new series I'm doing", "114:38", "gets picked up for a second season well", "114:40", "I'm gonna recommend to the producers", "114:41", "they they put the Epstein case on there", "114:43", "no it's not quite in line with what we", "114:44", "do you sent me a", "114:47", "let me I'll forward it to James you get", "114:48", "it Jamie so let's look at the trailer", "114:50", "for this wouldn't it what is it called", "114:52", "its called black files Declassified and", "114:54", "what is it based on the Science Channel", "114:56", "Discovery Science Channel and it's", "114:58", "essentially it's it's a series looking", "115:00", "at there's something called the black", "115:02", "budget right let's play the let's go", "115:06", "talk about it let's go to the clip", "115:08", "ladies and gentlemen here black files", "115:10", "Declassified listen to that a top-secret", "115:16", "aviation program they will neither", "115:19", "confirm nor deny the existence of", "115:22", "records funded by a mysterious money", "115:25", "trail there was a lot of thought into", "115:26", "how we're going to hide the various pots", "115:29", "of money could revolutionize flight", "115:32", "do you think that you'll see man", "115:34", "hypersonic flight in your lifetime hello", "115:37", "yeah and unleash a new lethal technology", "115:41", "extremely high speeds Mach five six that", "115:44", "would make these cruise missiles almost", "115:45", "impossible to defend against every year", "115:56", "more than ninety billion dollars is", "115:58", "allocated to clandestine government", "116:00", "programs collectively called the black", "116:03", "budget

the black files damn I'd", "116:36", "watch that over and over again well", "116:40", "that's that all that kind of shit's", "116:42", "fascinating to me that's got into a", "116:44", "sonic flight was that does that mean", "116:46", "like settles one of our first episodes", "116:48", "yeah when you make when you same and", "116:50", "hypersonic like they used to have the", "116:51", "Concorde that was hypersonic right no it", "116:53", "wasn't no no hypersonic is essentially", "116:56", "anything over Mach 5 is hypersonic so", "116:58", "what is and and so we don't have there's", "117:00", "nothing there's no manned hypersonic", "117:01", "flight yet so the Concorde was the speed", "117:04", "of sound yeah and this is it faster than", "117:06", "the speed of sound yeah five times", "117:08", "faster I mean you talk about a mile a", "117:10", "mile a second or so for a missile a", "117:13", "missile traveling so that's what Russia", "117:15", "just came out and and and announced the", "117:18", "deployment of a new hypersonic missile", "117:20", "or a weapon and that's where the the the", "117:24", "the war in space or the you know it's", "117:27", "going basically isn't a hypersonic", "117:29", "mostly unmanned there's some effort to", "117:31", "try to figure out can we create a a", "117:33", "manned vehicle it's really problematic", "117:36", "because you think about traveling that", "117:37", "fast you think about what that means for", "117:39", "punching through the air and the heat", "117:40", "and the in the the the materials that", "117:43", "are needed but as far as unmanned glide", "117:47", "vehicles or whatever I mean that's where", "117:50", "a tremendous amount of resources being", "117:51", "put right now by the Russians the", "117:52", "Chinese the US and it's it's it's pretty", "117:58", "frightening cuz we don't have any way to", "118:00", "defend against it like like the one", "118:02", "fellow I mentioned in that clip is that", "118:04", "if you think about a trip sort of a", "118:08", "ballistic missile it's got a trajectory", "118:09", "right it goes up and it comes down you", "118:12", "know just like the Cold War days we had", "118:13", "we had all the defense's set up you know", "118:15", "to intercept Russian missiles coming", "118:17", "towards us well we knew what the path", "118:19", "was going to be and so we were able to", "118:21", "deploy a defense system against this the", "118:23", "idea with hypersonic weapons is you have", "118:26", "no idea right you've got almost no", "118:28", "warning and you", "118:30", "you'd have no idea what that trajectory", "118:31", "is for those doing so it's going so fast", "118:34", "and it's in its adjustable right so it's", "118:36", "not just depending on you know a missile", "118:38", "ballistic missile goes up and it's going", "118:39", "to come down and you know exactly what", "118:41", "that path is going to so they can adjust", "118:42", "it like they can slow it down you can", "118:44", "slow it down you can change direction", "118:46", "yeah yeah so you think about this it's", "118:48", "it's a it's a big deal so one of our I", "118:50", "think it may be our first episode it's", "118:52", "gonna be focused on hypersonic sand and", "118:54", "it's it's but that's a variety of other", "118:57", "episodes in this thing but it's all", "118:58", "looking at this idea that the black", "119:00", "budget exists it does exist and there's", "119:02", "you know each project that whether it", "119:05", "was is a project to develop hypersonic", "119:07", "flight in which the US government had", "119:09", "that whether it's you know advanced", "119:11", "aviation threat identification program", "119:13", "whether it's the space Force which has", "119:17", "been actually around for a long time", "119:19", "there's budgets that account for these", "119:22", "programs and they have to be hidden", "119:23", "somewhere I mean the government's got to", "119:24", "spend the money right so the idea being", "119:26", "what started this thing off was the idea", "119:28", "that well what if you just literally", "119:29", "just did follow the money and try to", "119:31", "figure out from the money trails how", "119:33", "they were developing these projects and", "119:36", "could you identify the various projects", "119:37", "that these pots of money you know go to", "119:40", "and it's turned out to be really it's", "119:41", "very interesting", "119:42", "I'm subjective of course but it's it's", "119:46", "it's pretty good and it's we don't have", "119:48", "a specific air date yet you know they're", "119:51", "being very mom about it but it'll be on", "119:53", "Sunday nights coming to a science", "119:55", "channel near you soon", "119:56", "so with these hypersonic missiles they", "120:00", "can like you can't judge from the path", "120:04", "that it's gone so far where it's going", "120:06", "right because they can steer them in", "120:08", "real time yeah yeah the idea being is it", "120:10", "not it's not following a a known", "120:13", "trajectory it's not following a", "120:14", "ballistic trajectory um so it is it you", "120:17", "know and it's it is the the development", "120:22", "the effort to try to develop manned", "120:24", "hypersonic flight has got a really", "120:28", "fascinating history I mean and and", "120:30", "particularly here in the US but we're", "120:32", "not there we're not there yet that's you", "120:35", "know may not happen in our lifetimes", "120:36", "just because of the difficulty she", "120:37", "talked about I mean I interviewed some", "120:39", "terrific people during the course of", "120:42", "that which is the best part of this", "120:43", "serious being out from my perspective", "120:44", "you travel around you see all these", "120:46", "interesting things you talk to these", "120:47", "fantastic folks right I mean some", "120:48", "credible people a former pilot for the", "120:50", "they will Blackbird program right this", "120:53", "guy you know strapped into this thing", "120:55", "and get up to altitude you know on

they can if", "121:26", "they can set aside their fear and they", "121:28", "you know they have that risk appetite", "121:30", "that's a funny way of putting that risk", "121:33", "appetite yeah well I mean they just", "121:35", "don't think I mean a test pilot doesn't", "121:37", "think the way that you are well you know", "121:38", "maybe thinks the way you don't want it", "121:39", "not the way I do I mean it's awesome", "121:41", "folks but yeah but anyway so yes that's", "121:46", "what person like the first person who", "121:48", "goes up in one of those things to forget", "121:50",

guy", "122:07", "looks like somebody's granddad right you", "122:09", "know do you believe they'll be man", "122:10", "hypersonic flight in your lifetime he", "122:12", "says this guy's the story of this guy", "122:14", "testing experimental aircraft to try to", "122:18", "get to that point and some of the things", "122:20", "that he did and it it's astounding", "122:23", "you look at him you think you're not", "122:25", "you're not normal and I talked to his", "122:27", "wife and and she said yeah it's", "122:29", "interesting she's been married to him", "122:30", "forever but she says you know I want to", "122:31", "interesting things you learn about being", "122:32", "married to somebody like this a test", "122:34", "pilot or somebody else in a position", "122:36", "like that is you know they don't process", "122:38", "things the same way they don't", "122:40", "necessarily have a lot of empathy", "122:41", "because they're just they're just", "122:43", "focused on this thing right and they're", "122:44", "not necessarily thinking well I don't", "122:45", "wanna go up there and die because I'd be", "122:46", "leaving my family behind and all you", "122:48", "know yeah it's not in the thought", "122:50", "process anyway but so that's there you", "122:53", "have it ladies and gentlemen what do you", "122:55", "think about all", "122:57", "stuff about I mean the New York Times", "123:00", "had articles about it there's Air Force", "123:03", "test pilots have come out talking about", "123:05", "encountering flying saucers or", "123:08", "unidentified flying objects particularly", "123:11", "commander flavor who right had that", "123:13", "David for everything yeah yeah what do", "123:15", "you think about all that yeah we do you", "123:18", "know I'm a shameless marketer we do an", "123:20", "episode on on that on a tip on the", "123:23", "advanced aviation threat identification", "123:25", "program and look again I I always say", "123:29", "the same thing I'm not a conspiracy guy", "123:30", "I tend to I tend to be very cynical", "123:32", "about everything but after talking to", "123:36", "some of these folks including forever", "123:37", "and and a handful of others who were", "123:41", "both pilots and also were involved in", "123:43", "the a tip program for the US government", "123:45", "for the military there's there's things", "123:48", "out there that we haven't been able to", "123:50", "identify and I'm not jumping on on the", "123:54", "I'm not jumping on the alien train", "123:57", "necessary but what I'm saying is that", "123:59", "there are things that that extremely", "124:01", "experienced pilots military pilots with", "124:04", "significant amounts of experience", "124:08", "couldn't figure out couldn't identify", "124:10", "right and so I'm certainly not gonna be", "124:12", "smart enough to say okay this is what it", "124:13", "was was it a foreign governments", "124:17", "experimental aircraft was it something I", "124:19", "don't know but what I do know is that", "124:21", "the US government took it seriously", "124:23", "enough that they developed their own", "124:26", "internal program within the Pentagon to", "124:28", "try to sort out the wheat from the chaff", "124:30", "right and and say okay what do we", "124:32", "actually have to worry about in part", "124:34", "because it's a national security issue", "124:35", "right if there is a aircraft or if", "124:38", "there's something up there that it pilot", "124:40", "a military pilot sees for instance that", "124:42", "I can't identify alright we have an", "124:44", "obligation to figure out what that is", "124:45", "because if it's a hostile foreign", "124:47", "governments efforts in developing you", "124:49", "know craft that we don't know about how", "124:50", "to or propulsion systems we don't know", "124:52", "about then yes we should be working on", "124:54", "that issue the problem has always been", "124:57", "that once you talk about that then", "124:59", "people that me to go up aliens huh area", "125:02", "51 you know and it kind of gets", "125:03", "dismissed but there was a much more", "125:06", "serious effort than I I knew about", "125:08", "before I started working on this", "125:10", "and so I don't know I think you know", "125:14", "I've got an open mind about that you", "125:16", "know it's it's like that old you know", "125:18", "thing about how you know how can we", "125:20", "really be the only people out here and", "125:21", "or or", "125:23", "life-forms out here I don't know that", "125:26", "seems you know seems a little obscure", "125:30", "for me to believe it seems unrealistic", "125:32", "yeah yeah so but when I got like braver", "125:35", "yeah that's that's the thing when", "125:36", "someone who's that rock-solid rhymes out", "125:39", "and tells the story and he's not", "125:40", "deviating from his story he's not a guy", "125:42", "was trying to make money he's just he", "125:44", "doesn't have a history of telling", "125:46", "fantastic stories and he knew what it", "125:47", "meant when he country didn't come", "125:48", "forward and talk about this and you've", "125:49", "got the gun cameras and you've got the", "125:51", "radar operators who also saw the same", "125:53", "thing they saw it and they said it was", "125:55", "actively jamming their radar yeah", "125:57", "which they say what the fuck and then", "125:58", "that the way it moved from 60,000 feet", "126:00", "down to like 200 feet and like less than", "126:02", "a second and no signs of no there's no", "126:04", "signs of any propulsion system ya know", "126:07", "there was this there's several things", "126:08", "about that that ya leave you scratching", "126:10", "your head again I'm not I'm not making a", "126:12", "case one way or the other you know that", "126:14", "the point of this is to again is to kind", "126:17", "of use the money trail as a way to get", "126:20", "inside some of these programs and then", "126:21", "to the degree that you can without you", "126:23", "know to the degree that you can talk", "126:24", "about things that are Declassified you", "126:28", "know not necessarily try to make a case", "126:30", "we're not trying to say it is this or it", "126:32", "is that you know but I think we're", "126:34", "presenting a lot of interesting", "126:35", "information that you know again with", "126:36", "this situation with favor as an example", "126:39", "you know you come away from it you think", "126:41", "okay I'm not dismissing anything at this", "126:43", "point", "126:43", "mmm just it's you know it would be it", "126:45", "would be I think foolish to err or", "126:47", "anyway so interesting stuff but was that", "126:50", "ever anything that came up during your", "126:51", "career no no we now I was pretty much", "126:56", "straightforward you know pound the", "126:58", "ground through some counterinsurgency", "127:00", "operations counter-narcotics", "127:01", "counterterrorism operations we never did", "127:04", "any counter alien things right that must", "127:08", "have been it that was a different", "127:09", "operation that was a that was on a floor", "127:11", "we weren't allowed to go on to its", "127:12", "headquarters seems like if we had to", "127:14", "admit it was real if it was something", "127:16", "that was real and we were being", "127:17", "contacted on a regular basis or at least", "127:19", "semi regular basis that would change the", "127:22", "way everybody feel", "127:23", "about everything yes remember when", "127:26", "Reagan of that speech made me give it I", "127:29", "think was the United Nations you said to", "127:30", "imagine how easily we would come", "127:32", "together if we were faced with a threat", "127:33", "from an alien world right and", "127:35", "everybody's like oh my god he knows", "127:36", "something aliens", "127:39", "he's about to spill the beans yeah well", "127:45", "but think about it me think if you know", "127:46", "if that did come out which is what part", "127:48", "of the Alaura right is the idea that you", "127:50", "know the government's been keeping this", "127:52", "from us for all these years and and you", "127:54", "know you think about what that would", "127:55", "mean not just obviously boom oh my god", "127:57", "really there's something going on out", "127:58", "there but then sort of that breakdown in", "128:00", "trust not that it's not happening", "128:02", "already in terms of the government and", "128:04", "its ability to you know play square but", "128:07", "yeah I mean look area 51 area 51 was was", "128:10", "scouted out for use as an experimental", "128:15", "you know test site for aircraft and you", "128:18", "know made perfect sense well then you", "128:20", "get all these experimental aircraft", "128:21", "being developed out there and flown some", "128:24", "successfully some not and you know", "128:26", "locals you know see this jet you know", "128:29", "locals being a fairly good-sized region", "128:32", "because of the the the distance on these", "128:34", "and you know it's understandable how you", "128:37", "start getting some of these stories but", "128:41", "you know having having said that you", "128:44", "know I sat down with forever right and", "128:46", "we talked about this a lot for this one", "128:49", "episode and I talked to several others", "128:51", "and yeah again I come away and I'm not", "128:55", "sure what to think but again I'm not", "128:57", "closing the book on anything at this", "128:58", "point see the way I'd looked at it is if", "129:00", "these were unique expeditions from", "129:03", "another planet like or whatever it is", "129:05", "that comes here some alien spacecraft", "129:07", "all they'd have to do is come here once", "129:09", "or twice get fed up well not an ad but I", "129:14", "used to have a bit about how Earth is", "129:16", "the Tijuana of outer space they only", "129:17", "come down here when they're fucked up", "129:18", "and they want to see a show they don't", "129:22", "stay they just come down there what they", "129:23", "find it like no one's doing a science", "129:25", "expeditions to Tijuana I'm not going", "129:27", "back there no way not unless I'm drunk", "129:30", "again yeah I was just thinking that if", "129:32", "they were gonna come down here and", "129:34", "examine us I mean they could", "129:36", "just do it a couple of times and people", "129:39", "of these stories and everybody else", "129:41", "dismisses it like where are they worthy", "129:42", "I don't see any aliens yeah because you", "129:44", "really wouldn't and you probably do if", "129:46", "they're capable of moving at the speed", "129:48", "that flavor described where it was just", "129:50", "impossible to track with the human eye", "129:53", "like they're not gonna view us as a", "129:55", "threat No yeah they're not gonna think", "129:57", "we're just I don't know then I can look", "129:59", "at us and say we want to steal their", "130:01", "technology it's the most fascinating", "130:02", "thing to me at all the weird what-ifs", "130:05", "and who could do this and how could that", "130:07", "be true the alien one is the most", "130:09", "fascinating

the", "142:24", "strife no it's it's taking advantage of", "142:26", "human nature to some but it's also I", "142:29", "mean it you've raised a really important", "142:31", "point because coming up on

story", "144:27", "or report is correct I mean there's some", "144:29", "discussion as to whether it's accurate", "144:31", "or not but to that degree that you have", "144:33", "to look at everything now with a very", "144:35", "skeptical eye and you have to say okay", "144:37", "what is the purpose of it why is this a", "144:39", "timed leak of information right did they", "144:43", "intended in
