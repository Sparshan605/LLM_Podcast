"a religion like you said where you want", "06:40", "to believe something and so you just", "06:41", "find you know this is this study that I", "06:43", "also see circulating a lot around that", "06:45", "why plants are really bad to eat it's", "06:47", "like they're there they're there means", "06:49", "that the insect anti-nutrients or", "06:51", "pesticides", "06:52", "it's from my former

plants then", "07:21", "maybe read the paper and realize oh it's", "07:22", "also talking about heterocyclic amines", "07:25", "as well the point of the paper was like", "07:27", "I'm getting a little

natural you know ants insect", "07:41", "anti fetuses that are fountain plants", "07:43", "and some of the cook things and meat and", "07:45", "as well as some of the the pesticides", "07:47", "that are found in synthetic pesticides", "07:48", "basically that they're in such small", "07:50", "amounts so that was kind of the point of", "07:52", "the paper was back in the 90s and but I", "07:55", "just think that it's a little", "07:56", "hypocritical to use a paper you know as", "08:00", "like and literally it's like I mean it's", "08:02", "like proliferated everywhere that's like", "08:04", "I see this paper all the time yes it's", "08:06", "like well did you read the paper because", "08:08", "it has a whole section on on the insect", "08:10", "anti feed it's from coffee which a lot",

are", "08:22", "realizing there's certain things you can", "08:24", "do and certain things you can't do", "08:25", "certain things we accept certain things", "08:26", "we can't accept any more and we're", "08:28", "figuring it out and we're figuring it", "08:29", "out in real time in at a radical pace", "08:32", "that's never existed before in human", "08:34", "history where something that was", "08:36", "acceptable just 10-15 years ago", "08:38", "is completely unacceptable now that's", "08:41", "there's never been a time like that", "08:42", "before never been a time in the entire", "08:44", "world since people started talking", "08:47", "there's never been a time where", "08:49", "is taking place at such a radical pace", "08:51", "and you're a part of it and I'm a part",

that the", "09:02", "reason all this is happening right now", "09:04", "is because we are now we're just", "09:06", "communicating at a more rapid pace", "09:07", "that's all it boils down to you're",
