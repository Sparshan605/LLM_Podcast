used to be", "01:09", "Democrats that defended him right but", "01:11", "then he pissed off the Democrats because", "01:12", "he leaked on the DNC and he showed you", "01:15", "know what was going on with Hillary", "01:16", "behind the scenes and now the primary", "01:18", "was basically rigged against Bernie", "01:19", "Sanders so Democrats used to like him", "01:21", "now Democrats hate him and Trump used to", "01:23", "like him when he said when he was", "01:24", "getting this information on Hillary but", "01:27", "they hate him as well because Trump has", "01:28", "basically been convinced by the people", "01:31", "around him in the White House that this", "01:33", "guy is dangerous because this guy", "01:35", "basically exposed US war crimes that's", "01:37", "why they're coming after him because he", "01:39", "released a video which showed that we", "01:41", "were killing civilians and then we", "01:44", "circle back around and did what's called", "01:45", "a double tap where we killed the first", "01:46", "responders and the idea at the time was", "01:49", "oh it's okay we're going after al-qaeda", "01:50", "but come to find out that wasn't", "01:52", "al-qaeda they were innocent civilians", "01:53", "and then they were the medics that came", "01:55", "afterwards and so Julian Assange thought", "01:57", "hey listen this is not something we", "01:58", "should be doing and the American people", "02:00", "deserve to know about this this", "02:01", "shouldn't be top-secret this is a war", "02:03", "crime and so he released that and then", "02:05", "that's why they were coming after him", "02:06", "and throwing the book at him because you", "02:08", "know just like with Mike Ravel", "02:10", "previously Daniel Ellsberg actually is", "02:12", "who I'm thinking of just like with", "02:13", "Daniel Ellsberg", "02:13", "when he showed the what we were doing in", "02:16", "Vietnam and how we were killing", "02:17", "civilians they do not want you to expose", "02:19", "their war crimes they will throw the", "02:20", "book at you and act like you're a spy", "02:22", "you're working for a foreign country", "02:24", "you're a traitor because they want to", "02:25", "keep that stuff under wraps because it", "02:27", "really embarrasses them and it really", "02:28", "shows what US Empire is doing around the", "02:30", "world that was that Collateral Murder", "02:32", "video yes yeah what's really bizarre", "02:35", "about this is how no one speaks out", "02:37", "against it no one no one on the right no", "02:38", "one on the left it's just this thing now", "02:41", "yeah I don't I mean it's like it doesn't", "02:43", "have a home yeah well unfortunately what", "02:46", "you see is it becomes very partisan so", "02:48", "when when Obama is doing drone strikes", "02:51", "and killing 90% innocent people", "02:53", "unfortunately partisan Democrats don't", "02:55", "talk about it now that Trump has", "02:57", "increased drone strikes by four hundred", "02:59", "and thirty two percent over Obama with", "03:01", "still a tremendously high civilian death", "03:02", "rate now you know maybe some Democrats", "03:05", "will talk about it but Republicans", "03:07", "certainly don't talk about it but four", "03:08", "hundred and thirty two hundred thirty", "03:10", "two percent that's right and Obama was a", "03:12", "radical acceleration of the Bush", "03:14", "administration's drone policy that's", "03:16", "right and Trump has increased it even", "03:18", "more and see that's the problem is", "03:19", "people get mad now that you know Trump", "03:22", "is at the helm of this stuff but all of", "03:24", "these things now it's precedent he's not", "03:26", "doing anything that wasn't established", "03:27", "beforehand it was two answers the one", "03:29", "you say Trump is doing it who exact", "03:32", "exactly making the call do they bring", "03:34", "this call to trump and they say hey you", "03:36", "know we're gonna bomb Yemen we're gonna", "03:38", "do this with drones and this does he", "03:40", "have to sign off on each individual", "03:42", "attack that's a great question and the", "03:44", "short answer is I don't know I wouldn't", "03:46", "be surprised if Trump was directly", "03:47", "involved in some of these instances I", "03:49", "know that his first military raid is", "03:51", "president that he approved ended up", "03:52", "killing a nine year old American girl", "03:54", "it was Anwar al-awlaki's daughter I", "03:57", "believe and but I also do think that", "04:00", "there is this what you can call the deep", "04:02", "state I know people think that's like a", "04:03", "conspiratorial term but it's really not", "04:04", "all that saying is that the CIA the NSA", "04:07", "the FBI these are people who are in", "04:10", "these positions of power and they're", "04:12", "there they're throughout all these", "04:15", "different administrations yes Snowden", "04:16", "talked about that exactly so that's not", "04:18", "conspiratorial and so when when you have", "04:20", "a kill list and when you have people at", "04:22", "the CIA and the Pentagon by the way a", "04:23", "lot of them are calling the shots and", "04:25", "maybe they just need an okay every now", "04:27", "and then from President Trump but yeah I", "04:30", "mean I think that there's it's not just", "04:33", "one person making all the decisions I", "04:35", "think that the president does play a", "04:36", "role but I also think it's generals I", "04:38", "think it's people at the CIA and I think", "04:40", "it's this complex web of people who are", "04:42", "all kind of involved in this thing that", "04:43", "ends up being drastically negative", "04:45", "yeah drastically negative to put it", "04:47", "mildly right when you're talking about", "04:49", "90% civilian casualties with drone", "04:51", "strikes that's such a disturbing thing", "04:54", "that this continues that no one says hey", "04:57", "this is grossly ineffective and horrific", "05:01", "in its consequences yeah what they do is", "05:04", "you know they give everybody a false", "05:06", "choice that make it seem like hey listen", "05:07", "man if we're not doing these all-out", "05:09", "ground invasions and we're not doing", "05:10", "like war war with boots on the ground", "05:12", "well what do you want us to do like", "05:14", "there are bad people out there we got to", "05:15", "go after these bad people so this is", "05:16", "like the soft power option if you will", "05:19", "and my response that has always been", "05:21", "yeah but you do have to follow the", "05:23", "Constitution and the way our system is", "05:25", "supposed to work is you can't have the", "05:27", "president just declare war and just go", "05:29", "and do it Congress has to approve war so", "05:31", "if you wanted to do a drone war okay but", "05:34", "you got to get a declaration of war tell", "05:36", "me exactly which countries you're gonna", "05:37", "be doing the bombing in while you're", "05:39", "doing the bombing in those countries and", "05:40", "get an approval through Congress so if", "05:42", "you were coming to me and say hey man", "05:43", "there's an al-qaeda cell that's very", "05:45", "active in Pakistan or whatever so we", "05:49", "want to approve a drone war have", "05:50", "Congress vote on it see what happens and", "05:52", "then move from there but what we're", "05:53", "doing now is it's just baked into the", "05:55", "cake that we violate US law we violate", "05:57", "the Constitution and we violate", "05:59", "international law with all these", "06:00", "bombings because as of right now we're", "06:02", "bombing at least eight different", "06:03", "countries and we also have a shadow war", "06:05", "going on in Africa so this is we do", "06:07", "absolutely the shadow war and effort so", "06:09", "the intercept reported on this I don't", "06:11", "know as much on this off the top of my", "06:13", "head but if you wouldn't mind please", "06:15", "pulling up an article from the intercept", "06:17", "there's a shadow war going on in Africa", "06:18", "where we're building military bases all", "06:20", "over Africa and the idea is I think that", "06:23", "we have these bases where we can the", "06:27", "drones fly out of and they could go to", "06:28", "the Middle East and they can bomb there", "06:29", "is this also in response to the fact", "06:32", "that China is essentially moving into", "06:34", "large parts of Africa to extract", "06:36", "minerals and see natural resources yes", "06:38", "and this is actually super interesting", "06:40", "because the China thing", "06:41", "they're doing this belt and road", "06:43", "initiative and basically this is like", "06:45", "their version of empire through debt", "06:48", "okay so what they do is they'll go into", "06:51", "like they just made a deal with Iraq we", "06:52", "spent trillions of dollars interact at", "06:54", "an illegal and offensive war China", "06:55", "swoops in and they go hey listen what we", "06:58", "want to do is help you guys we want to", "07:00", "build your infrastructure up we want to", "07:02", "make your country beautiful so if you do", "07:04", "a deal with us we're gonna like build", "07:06", "all the infrastructure which do you", "07:08", "credit exactly and then what happens", "07:10", "they turn around and they say okay well", "07:11", "then you can get a certain percentage of", "07:12", "our oil sales or whatever it might be so", "07:14", "this is and it's funny because there's", "07:16", "been this like evolution when it comes", "07:18", "to empires so it used to be back in the", "07:20", "day you just kind of go up on somebody", "07:22", "shores and say mine I'm taking it and", "07:24", "you do it by force then the u.s. evolved", "07:26", "from them what the u.s. does is it's", "07:28", "this cute little trick where we say no", "07:30", "no we're not going to control you", "07:31", "directly what we will do is take", "07:33", "somebody from your native land prop them", "07:35", "up as a dictator and then they will", "07:38", "allow us corporate interest to go in", "07:39", "there and kind of exploit the natural", "07:41", "resources but it's intelligent because", "07:42", "you're saying no no we're not in there", "07:44", "ourselves like the British did in India", "07:45", "for example or they just showed up and", "07:47", "they're like it's ours you know there", "07:48", "was a British presence there very", "07:50", "clearly we have people from their native", "07:52", "lands take control but we exploit stuff", "07:55", "from them and extract stuff from them so", "07:56", "China took that one step further where", "07:58", "it's like okay no we're actually gonna", "07:59", "provide you with you know material", "08:02", "well-being we're gonna give you a solid", "08:03", "infrastructure and then it's like you", "08:04", "look at it more like a business deal", "08:06", "than an expansion of empire and honestly", "08:08", "this is one of the weird benefits of", "08:10", "having an authoritarian like system like", "08:13", "China does is they can make a decision", "08:14", "on a dime yeah you could just have the", "08:16", "the Communist Party just goes yeah well", "08:18", "we'll do this because this is the best", "08:19", "way to do it and there can be no nobody", "08:21", "can fire back and say I don't agree with", "08:23", "that let's stop it here the way Western", "08:25", "democracies work it's almost like you", "08:27", "have this certain slowness that's built", "08:29", "into the process because there's so many", "08:30", "checks and balances and in many ways", "08:32", "that's a good thing you want a system", "08:33", "like that but in many ways it provides a", "08:35", "strategic disadvantage at least when", "08:36", "you're talking about imperialism so", "08:38", "here's the article from the intercept US", "08:40", "special operations numbers surge in", "08:42", "Africa's shadow Wars the most dramatic", "08:45", "growth in deployment of American elite", "08:47", "troops of any region of the globe over", "08:50", "the past decade according to newly", "08:51", "released numbers Africa", "08:53", "it says in 2006 just 1% of commandos", "08:57", "sent overseas were deployed in the u.s.", "08:59", "Africa Command area of operations in", "09:02", "2016-17 point to 6% of all Special", "09:07", "Operations Forces Navy SEALs and Green", "09:09", "Berets among them deployed abroad were", "09:12", "sent to Africa so this is something like", "09:14", "you never hear him ever hear about it", "09:16", "never been a vote on it they just do it", "09:18", "Wow", "09:19", "it's scary it's scary the way that it", "09:21", "works how you really do have a deep", "09:25", "state if you will kind of making", "09:26", "decisions and the president just kind of", "09:28", "goes along with it and we're all sitting", "09:29", "around here acting like hey man maybe", "09:31", "instead of doing that we can actually I", "09:33", "don't know use some of our tax dollars", "09:35", "to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure", "09:36", "which gets a grade of D plus I mean but", "09:39", "I think doing it because they see a", "09:41", "threat like exclusive USS mu has more", "09:44", "military operations in Africa than the", "09:46", "Middle East whoa", "09:48", "now is this is it possible because they", "09:51", "see a threat I think that's the", "09:53", "rationalization that they use but I", "09:55", "think it has more to do with power and", "09:57", "control and when you're the world's sole", "09:59", "superpower you don't want to cede that", "10:00", "ground to anybody else right and so the", "10:03", "benefits that come along with that in", "10:04", "their mind is they can rationalize", "10:06", "jacking natural resources from all over", "10:08", "the world by saying no listen you'd", "10:10", "rather have us in this position then you", "10:12", "would Russia then you would China so", "10:14", "it's really like this the idea is in", "10:16", "their own minds it's like we're a", "10:18", "benevolent superpower that's only doing", "10:21", "this to keep the World Order when Mike", "10:23", "Baker tried to explain wha wait to me", "10:25", "and one of the things that he Mike Baker", "10:27", "from the CIA and one of the things that", "10:28", "he was explaining he said you have to", "10:30", "realize that there is no such thing as", "10:33", "industry independent of government in", "10:36", "China if you have something like Huawei", "10:38", "if you have a giant corporation they are", "10:40", "inexorably connected to the Chinese", "10:42", "government and the moves they make are", "10:44", "not necessarily designed for you know", "10:47", "the infinite growth paradigm this idea", "10:50", "that we have in the United States with", "10:51", "corporations are beholding the", "10:53", "stockholders or just trying to make", "10:55", "money that's not what they're doing over", "10:56", "there they have a long game and the long", "10:59", "game involves information involves", "11:02", "espionage it involves stealing trade", "11:05", "secrets and and", "11:06", "patents from other companies and so when", "11:09", "they're selling them these modems", "11:11", "they've got built-in third-party options", "11:14", "so the third party meaning China can", "11:16", "extract information so if you're if", "11:19", "someone has this modem and they're using", "11:20", "this modem to send information to", "11:23", "someone in Beirut China can also get", "11:27", "that information yeah they do a lot of", "11:29", "cyber I mean that that's the thing", "11:31", "that's been known for a long time that", "11:32", "they're they'll you know Jack patents", "11:35", "and intellectual property and they have", "11:36", "this whole you know economy that's kind", "11:39", "of thriving off technology that's made", "11:40", "elsewhere that's certainly an issue but", "11:43", "also I would argue that is probably the", "11:45", "case with the u.s. too that this kind of", "11:47", "distinction between corporations in the", "11:50", "state is largely a veneer because you", "11:52", "have such control of our political", "11:54", "process because of big money from", "11:56", "corporations flowing into the system so", "11:57", "I think that a lot of these decisions", "11:59", "that are made even when it comes to", "12:01", "foreign policy are directly in relation", "12:03", "to how it will impact those corporations", "12:04", "like the thing that I remember was a", "12:06", "light bulb moment for me back in the day", "12:08", "when I first learned about it was the", "12:10", "banana wars have you ever heard about", "12:12", "this no back in the day I think it was", "12:14", "in the late 1800s but don't quote me on", "12:16", "that we just went into South America and", "12:19", "started toppling governments because we", "12:21", "wanted to Jack their bananas and it was", "12:23", "literally further I think the Chiquita", "12:24", "banana company that we did that really", "12:26", "yeah so when you look at that you go", "12:28", "okay well that kind of distinction", "12:30", "between corporation and government is", "12:32", "not even really a thing here it's like", "12:34", "this veneer that's in between the two", "12:35", "but really it's the powerful moneyed", "12:39", "interests and the elites that kind of", "12:40", "run everything and they're they're", "12:41", "married at the hip whether they're in", "12:43", "the government or whether they're in", "12:44", "corporations what year was this I think", "12:46", "this was the late 1890s again I'm more", "12:48", "than happy to be fact-checking on this", "12:49", "but I remember the first time I read", "12:52", "about this it had to be in college the", "12:53", "banana Wars I was like that's insane for", "12:55", "bananas it's crazy", "12:59", "well how about when you go throughout", "13:01", "history and you find out that a lot of", "13:02", "the wars were over salt I didn't even", "13:05", "know that I didn't know how they killed", "13:07", "people for salt it was very important", "13:09", "back in the day because they didn't have", "13:10", "refrigerators so in order to preserve", "13:12", "things to keep them from being infected", "13:14", "by bacteria they would pour salt all", "13:17", "over their meat and salt all of their", "13:19", "fish", "13:20", "and that's how they preserve things", "13:21", "right you could apparently preserve", "13:22", "things for long periods of times when", "13:24", "you completely cover them with salt yeah", "13:26", "so it's yes I guess it's just always", "13:29", "been a thing that it's like wars over", "13:30", "resources yes now there's a lot about", "13:33", "oil but like we we're accustomed to the", "13:35", "oil stuff yeah you're right we have been", "13:38", "used that for quite a while and it's", "13:39", "interesting because what just happened", "13:41", "with Syria and Trump that was", "13:42", "fascinating is he at first he said oh", "13:44", "we're getting out of Syria were getting", "13:45", "out of northern Syria everybody went", "13:47", "crazy and said oh my god what about the", "13:48", "Kurds and then we come to find out like", "13:50", "three or four days later that he's like", "13:52", "well no we're actually taking these", "13:53", "troops from northern Syria moving them", "13:55", "over into western Iraq and they're gonna", "13:57", "be doing the same thing that they've", "13:59", "been doing from Western Iraq and then", "14:00", "Trump had the nerve to go out there and", "14:02", "say and we've secured the oil that's so", "14:04", "tremendous we've secured the oil we're", "14:06", "not gonna make the same mistake like we", "14:07", "made in Iraq again and this is something", "14:09", "that he had been saying at CPAC the", "14:11", "Conservative Political Action Conference", "14:12", "going back for years every year he'd", "14:14", "give a speech and he actually said like", "14:17", "we should we should have taken the oil", "14:19", "we should have taken the oil in Iraq", "14:20", "because we didn't want Isis to have it", "14:22", "and we should have it instead of Isis", "14:23", "and it's like he's he actually rips the", "14:26", "mask off of everything we're doing", "14:27", "because he has no filter and it's like", "14:29", "yeah that was a big part of it but what", "14:31", "he's just admitting in front of the", "14:32", "world is international law means nothing", "14:34", "we don't care about you know the proper", "14:37", "process we don't care about like imagine", "14:39", "for a second China did

rid of the corrupt", "23:12", "prosecutor and bring in a non corrupt", "23:14", "prosecutor that's why he was doing what", "23:16", "he did and holding that subsidy over", "23:17", "their head and they say the prosecutor", "23:19", "that eventually came into place actually", "23:21", "investigated the Biden family more so", "23:25", "that's why the Democrats say there's you", "23:26", "know you're kind of misleading by", "23:28", "putting this out there the argument that", "23:30", "Trump is making is well know you're", "23:32", "holding a billion dollar subsidy over", "23:34", "the head of a foreign government and", "23:36", "saying you have to listen to us and do X", "23:38", "Y & Z that's problematic in and of", "23:40", "itself yeah but furthermore it's like", "23:43", "it's corruption anyway we know that the", "23:45", "only reason hunter Biden was getting", "23:46", "paid 50 thousand dollars a month and", "23:47", "actually now people are saying it's not", "23:48", "fifty thousand it's eighty three", "23:49", "thousand dollars a month is because his", "23:51", "last name is Biden and so it's pay to", "23:52", "play corruption eighty three thousand", "23:55", "dollars a month is a lot of fucking", "23:56", "money and this is where I think like", "23:58", "Democrats are silly because they always", "24:00", "find the weakest anti Trump argument", "24:02", "possible and now they're put in a", "24:03", "position where they have to try to say", "24:04", "like oh the Biden's did nothing wrong at", "24:07", "all and Trump is all bad and bottom line", "24:09", "nobody's gonna believe that the Biden's", "24:11", "did nothing wrong when you're getting", "24:12", "eighty three thousand dollars a month", "24:13", "and you know anything about natural

"24:35", "arguments so they wanted to use this as", "24:37", "like oh we're gonna try to impeach him", "24:38", "over this and this is gonna be the thing", "24:40", "that we're gonna hang our hat on and", "24:41", "Nancy Pelosi even said we're gonna limit", "24:43", "the scope of the impeachment", "24:44", "investigation to only this only the", "24:46", "Ukraine phone call and then somebody", "24:47", "like me I'm sitting there I'm pulling my", "24:48", "hair out because I could actually give", "24:50", "you like three or four super legitimate", "24:53", "things they're impeachment worthy not", "24:55", "that I think it strategically makes", "24:56", "sense and we can get into that if you", "24:57", "want to but like the one that drives me", "25:00", "crazy is Donald Trump has a hotel in", "25:03", "Washington DC that he owns okay he took", "25:06", "three hundred thousand dollars through", "25:07", "that hotel from the Saudi government so", "25:10", "they're funneling him money

money through his hotel so", "25:27", "for me I'm looking at that I'm going oh", "25:29", "my god this scandal has everything it's", "25:31", "got personal corruption", "25:33", "it's got guns going to a vicious", "25:35", "genocide 'el country what was the money", "25:37", "for", "25:38", "the money in the hotel okay so what they", "25:40", "did is they had these like little", "25:42", "retreats at the hotel and Saudi Arabia", "25:44", "would pay for US veterans to go and stay", "25:48", "at these hotels and they would I don't", "25:49", "know if it's like tours of the capital", "25:51", "or whatever it is but they pay for these", "25:53", "veteran groups to go to the hotel but", "25:55", "then of course you look at it and you go", "25:56", "I don't know man three hundred thousand", "25:59", "dollars and the speculation is well of", "26:01", "course they overpaid on purpose but", "26:03", "furthermore even if they didn't Jimmy", "26:05", "Carter had to sell his peanut farm when", "26:07", "he was president because the idea was", "26:09", "hey we're not even saying you're doing", "26:11", "anything corrupt but just the fact that", "26:13", "you have this personal private business", "26:16", "it is theoretically possible that", "26:18", "foreign governments want to give you", "26:19", "money through your peanut farm so you", "26:21", "have to sell it because just the",

can't", "26:31", "be corrupt and take money from foreign", "26:32", "governments and Trump is doing that he", "26:34", "just is right so this $300,000 though", "26:37", "this is for services rendered this is", "26:39", "for hotel room", "26:40", "well that's what they say is it's for I", "26:41", "guess the meals and the hotel rooms and", "26:43", "whatnot I hate to say it this way but", "26:45", "that's not a lot of money to someone", "26:47", "like them well you know but then what I", "26:49", "always think about when people make that", "26:51", "point is you have to flip it what would", "26:52", "we be saying if it was the clinton", "26:54", "foundation getting $300,000 from the", "26:56", "saudi government and then Hillary", "26:58", "Clinton as Secretary of State approving", "27:00", "a weapons deal to Saudi Arabia and the", "27:02", "fact of the matter is that actually is", "27:03", "almost exactly like what happened with", "27:05", "the Clinton Foundation because Bill", "27:06", "Clinton was going around and giving", "27:07", "speeches yeah at all these you know Gulf", "27:09", "dictatorships and then that he was", "27:11", "getting you know five hundred thousand",

actually cost money these", "27:30", "speeches are worthless that's a in my", "27:32", "opinion in my opinion those speeches are", "27:35", "a transparent bribe so do you think", "27:38", "though that a president should be able", "27:40", "to have private businesses the foreign", "27:42", "governments can pay him any amount of", "27:43", "money no I don't think so I don't I", "27:45", "don't sure but I just don't think", "27:46", "they're comparable like I think with the", "27:48", "Clinton Foundation I think the Clinton", "27:50", "Foundation was egregiously gross right I", "27:53", "think both of those things are", "27:54", "egregiously gross and I don't think it", "27:56", "influences him I think it's sure it sure", "27:58", "influences them because there's a deal", "27:59", "right

starting shit see", "56:54", "but it's weird see yeah I hear you", "56:56", "but at the same time the thing that is", "56:58", "has kind of shocked me is the degree to", "57:01", "which this is relied upon and used as", "57:05", "the scapegoat to to not talk about", "57:08", "sometimes things that are very real", "57:09", "issues and I know cuz it's been done", "57:11", "like they said with Bernie Sanders there", "57:13", "was this Russian troll farm meme created", "57:16", "of Bernie Sanders it's like he's like", "57:17", "rainbow-colored and he's doing like a", "57:19", "you know a pose where he's showing his", "57:20", "biceps or whatever and like that was", "57:22", "then used by mainstream media to say why", "57:25", "is wise Russia trying to prop up Bernie", "57:27", "Sanders why is he trying to prop up", "57:29", "Bernie Sanders so they try to make it", "57:31", "seem like Oh", "57:31", "Bernie's like a Russian puppet and a", "57:33", "Russian asset and if you support him",

and then", "57:59", "this becomes even a more confusing", "58:01", "argument like if they do do something", "58:04", "like that and they create these funny", "58:05", "memes and try to prop up Bernie

understands", "58:17", "what the fuck is going on that's the", "58:18", "point the point is to sow seeds of doubt", "58:21", "and to sort of disrupt democracy the", "58:24", "point is to do this very cheaply and", "58:27", "easily through internet accounts yeah", "58:29", "this is the idea behind it and if you", "58:31", "listen to sam Harris's podcast with the", "58:33", "Resta or the podcasts that I did with", "58:35", "her and when she goes into depth about", "58:38", "this you know understanding this and how", "58:40", "much time she spent researching this IRA", "58:44", "this internet

so this is a", "84:49", "very rare area a narrow area where I", "84:51", "want to give a credit but the thing that", "84:52", "drives me crazy Joe is I feel like the", "84:54", "media and the Democrats too and", "84:57", "definitely the Republicans establishment", "84:58", "Republicans they're trying to push him", "85:01", "in a more hawkish direction which makes", "85:03", "no sense

"85:33", "they're you know they work against peace", "85:35", "so we probably should stop that and then", "85:36", "he got a bunch of shit because you know", "85:38", "the media was like well what did you", "85:39", "extract from them by stopping those", "85:42", "those drills what did you get from them", "85:43", "as a result of it it's like you need to", "85:46", "get anything from them in North

to them", "99:55", "is this people like to you know make fun", "99:58", "of the green new deal and try to pick it", "100:00", "apart if we talk about the green new", "100:02", "deal and only define it

"100:24", "guy what if when we talk about the green", "100:28", "New Deal we're highlighting the fact", "100:30", "that yes we're gonna move towards", "100:31", "renewable and green technology yes", "100:33", "that's gonna be a large part of what", "100:34", "we're doing but the whole point guys is", "100:36", "millions and millions of jobs created", "100:39", "for regular people the whole point is to", "100:42", "improve this country to fix this country", "100:44", "to try to make it so that our", "100:45", "infrastructure is better than the rest", "100:46", "of the world what if instead of looking", "100:48", "at this is like oh my god this is gonna", "100:52", "be such a drain on the economy and", "100:53", "what's gonna happen to the deficit how", "100:55", "about you look at this like an economic", "100:56", "opportunity because what's gonna happen", "100:58", "in the future Joe there's inevitable", "100:59", "patents that are waiting to be had for", "101:02", "all these green and renewable", "101:03", "technologies we could lead the world on", "101:05", "that front", "101:06", "or we could lag behind Russia we could", "101:08", "lag behind China we can lag behind", "101:09", "everybody else and be stuck in you know", "101:12", "what would effectively be a stone-age so", "101:13", "they encourage this industry to flourish", "101:17", "well be subsidies like how do you what", "101:20", "do you do to get these industries to", "101:22", "innovate and to pump a shitload of money", "101:24", "into green technology it has to do with", "101:26", "government contracts it has to do with I", "101:28", "mean first and foremost before we even", "101:30", "do the right thing you have to stop", "101:31", "doing the wrong thing which is stop", "101:33", "giving four billion dollars a year every", "101:35", "year as a subsidy to ExxonMobil and they", "101:37", "hilariously say oh they need this money", "101:39", "because it's for research and", "101:40", "development no it's not they don't need", "101:42", "it for research in the moment there are", "101:43", "the most profitable corporations on the", "101:44", "planet they can do their own research", "101:45", "and development right so stop", "101:47", "subsidizing fossil fuels and then yes", "101:48", "what we need to do is invest in a", "101:51", "variety of different things that show a", "101:52", "little bit of promise some things won't", "101:54", "work okay some things will work and then", "101:56", "we move forward from there and so that's", "101:57", "where you could get the Hyperloop all", "101:59", "around this country what if all this", "102:00", "stuff was built and brought about", "102:02", "because we did a massive investment in a", "102:04", "green new deal mm-hmm then everybody", "102:06", "would talk about how it's a wonderful", "102:07", "thing", "102:07", "and how we're finally leading the world", "102:09", "and in our rightful place I find a", "102:10", "hilarious that you know guys like Trump", "102:12", "and guys like Joe Biden by the way love", "102:14", "to say like there's nothing this country", "102:16", "can't do and then in the next sentence", "102:18", "think I want to tell you a thousand", "102:19", "things that they think we can't do and", "102:20", "that we shouldn't do we shouldn't even", "102:21", "try well what what technologies have you", "102:24", "heard if any that are being even", "102:27", "proposed to mitigate global warming or", "102:29", "climate change well they're anything", "102:31", "there's the classic ones that I think", "102:32", "are more effective than people give it", "102:34", "credit for like solar is ones that's", "102:36", "it's effective the people I don't think", "102:37", "he gets its due but then there's other", "102:39", "things like thorium now let me just say", "102:41", "I'm not I'm not talking about a thorium", "102:43", "carks there was a car that was proposing", "102:45", "it was apparently was total bullshit", "102:46", "they couldn't make a thorium car work", "102:47", "but with door thorium thorium is", "102:49", "basically the way it's been described to", "102:51", "me is nuclear energy without the", "102:53", "downside of like you kick it could melt", "102:54", "down and destroy everything that's been", "102:57", "described to me so a nuclear powered car", "102:59", "no not a car we're talking about power", "103:02", "for the energy why not a nuclear power", "103:04", "well the thorium story that everybody", "103:06", "got pissed over was because they were", "103:08", "trying to make it seem like he was right", "103:09", "around the corner they had the plans and", "103:11", "it just wasn't and those people were", "103:12", "full of shit", "103:13", "but that doesn't mean thorium is bad and", "103:15", "totally off the table it just means that", "103:16", "that specific car they were talking", "103:18", "about was nonsense okay but if you have", "103:20", "thorium reactors it's basically like", "103:21", "meltdown proof or a nuclear facility", "103:23", "that's how it's been described now I'm", "103:25", "an idiot I have no idea how far off we", "103:27", "are from actually developing that but I", "103:29", "do know that we need to invest in this", "103:31", "and other things that show potential I", "103:34", "mean that's the only way to move forward", "103:35", "and the nuclear thing is very", "103:36", "interesting right because a lot of the", "103:37", "technology that's a problem today like", "103:40", "what happened in Fukushima is old", "103:41", "nuclear technology", "103:43", "well old technology that you can't", "103:45", "really shut down but they've mitigated a", "103:47", "lot of those issues apparently when you", "103:48", "talk to people that are pro nuclear when", "103:50", "they talk about the future of nuclear", "103:52", "power they're like look the we have", "103:53", "systems that have all this redundancy in", "103:55", "place you can shut them down there", "103:57", "they're much safer than the things that", "103:59", "they constructed essentially in the 70s", "104:01", "and the 60s", "104:02", "I'm skeptical on that point yeah and I'm", "104:04", "skeptical because at every step of the", "104:05", "way they they told us that so with", "104:08", "Fukushima before it happened they said", "104:10", "oh don't worry this is this it would", "104:13", "never happen here and then what happened", "104:14", "was of course you add the earthquake and", "104:16", "then you had the tsunami and they were", "104:17", "like oh we um we built the seawall high", "104:20", "enough yeah", "104:21", "that's like an engineering 101 mistake", "104:23", "and I'm gonna tell me you have", "104:24", "everything figured out on that front so", "104:25", "I'm a little skeptical when it comes to", "104:27", "nuclear for obvious reasons Chernobyl", "104:29", "there's a Three Mile Island five mile", "104:31", "island whatever is called and then", "104:32", "Fukushima but I do think that that", "104:35", "doesn't mean I would you know ban all", "104:36", "nuclear today but it does mean I think", "104:38", "there are better ways moving forward", "104:40", "they're cleaner that are safer right and", "104:42", "Solar is a big one particularly in", "104:44", "places like Los Angeles but with solar", "104:46", "you also need batteries and the battery", "104:48", "technology apparently is not as good as", "104:51", "would need to be in place in order to", "104:54", "power an entire city

off", "115:08", "because that's the way I look at it the", "115:10", "reality is when people argue for choice", "115:11", "and health insurance look at it like", "115:13", "this would you say hey man

the studies", "116:12", "show is it actually saves money so the", "116:15", "real question people should be asking is", "116:16", "how can we afford to keep having the", "116:18", "system that we have right now because we", "116:20", "pay more than the rest of the developed", "116:22", "world and we have thirty to forty five", "116:24", "thousand Americans that die every year", "116:26", "because

gets", "117:09", "everything I would be surprised if", "117:10", "funded that Medicare for all bill the", "117:12", "stem cells thing is covered but let's", "117:14", "say something like homeopathy

market maybe the market wouldn't be", "117:45", "there but it would be legally possible", "117:47", "is the point so it doesn't fully ban", "117:49", "private insurance plan", "117:50", "it bans

is", "128:10", "i 100% want that to be the case because", "128:12", "i prefer in many ways aspects of a", "128:14", "parliamentary system to our system and i", "128:16", "like the idea of having

work", "129:47", "is if what you were talking about with", "129:50", "voting on very specific issues because", "129:53", "if you most of the things that are", "129:56", "problems are not benefiting
