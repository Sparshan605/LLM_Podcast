["00:00", "haha hello freak bitches and I got", "00:04", "interesting things so they're really", "00:06", "asking it's a last night I believe you", "00:08", "you got a pile of notes what is it about", "00:10", "breathing what is it about breathing or", "00:13", "is breathing just one component of this", "00:15", "is it breathing and also focusing on", "00:18", "what you're trying to accomplish yeah", "00:19", "focus absolutely works let me explain a", "00:23", "little bit about breathing breathing is", "00:25", "chemistry oxygen is chemistry in the", "00:28", "body so if you are able to access", "00:31", "energize the cells more than we do", "00:34", "normally because we talked about the", "00:36", "lymphatic system and the tissue and", "00:39", "actually the body is able to store up", "00:42", "more oxygen than 100% we presumed a", "00:47", "possible it scientifically we are able", "00:51", "to store up more oxygen so if a", "00:54", "breathing technique whatever breathing", "00:55", "technique is able to store up more", "00:58", "oxygen in the cell that means going into", "01:01", "the tissue going into the lymphatic", "01:03", "system then suddenly the the chemistry", "01:06", "becomes alkaline the acid gets out of", "01:09", "the body at will and then the mind the", "01:14", "mind is positive a little electrical", "01:16", "charges neurotransmitters and they are", "01:20", "subtly able to connect in the body and", "01:23", "you enabling you to have control direct", "01:28", "all the systems in the body that's the", "01:31", "way nature manner to be so the mind a", "01:34", "minds condition to be effective in the", "01:37", "body is making the body by breath but at", "01:41", "the right breathing profound breathing", "01:43", "in an alkaline state then these", "01:46", "electrical signals are able to travel", "01:48", "throughout and we the way nature meant", "01:51", "it to be is that we are able to direct", "01:53", "any part of the body so the immune", "01:57", "system and the Crean system the", "01:59", "lymphatic system vascular's all the", "02:01", "systems we told a little bit last time", "02:04", "but I get more direct evidence now and", "02:07", "right now we are working with the", "02:09", "universities on the brain on say", "02:12", "emotional", "02:13", "reactivity and they see incredible", "02:16", "things that we actually are able to get", "02:19", "into those places where emotion exists", "02:23", "and we think yeah emotion where is it", "02:25", "where is it but it is translated also as", "02:28", "something chemical so they can measure", "02:31", "motion in the chemical form yes what are", "02:34", "they what are they measuring and they", "02:36", "they go in to say the hypothalamus", "02:39", "mm-hmm hypothalamus hippocampus amygdala", "02:43", "those are the places where this", "02:44", "chemistry is going on and we had no way", "02:47", "to get into that now if you are able to", "02:50", "oxidize those part and to pressurize", "02:54", "with breathing techniques into those", "02:56", "parts then suddenly you feel you begin", "02:59", "to cry alright because the chemistry is", "03:02", "changing you are dealing with the", "03:04", "chemistry which was stored up because", "03:07", "she couldn't work it up before and now", "03:09", "you are able to tap in there change the", "03:12", "chemistry and that that's the function", "03:14", "you're not able to deal with it now so", "03:18", "later when you have peace and you are", "03:21", "somewhere not stressful then work on it", "03:25", "and breathing does it it break it into", "03:30", "it positively influences the chemistry", "03:33", "in the in the depth of the brain you", "03:35", "know what happens you create 25% more", "03:40", "blood flow and a blood flow is with", "03:44", "oxygen through through your breathing", "03:45", "yes well it makes sense because your", "03:48", "blood is being it's carrying oxygen", "03:49", "right so the more oxygen you provide", "03:52", "your blood and you are definitely", "03:53", "providing it more with these big long", "03:55", "deep breaths and these techniques at you", "03:58", "that you pursue yes manipulating up the", "04:02", "spine the central nervous system up till", "04:05", "the tunnel of the light the brainstem is", "04:07", "at top so if you pressurize after act", "04:11", "inhaling exhaling like we did last time", "04:14", "you did about three minutes almost and", "04:16", "without air in the lungs very good first", "04:19", "round it's very promising for the next", "04:22", "rounds because you get more and more", "04:24", "oxygen it's only to show that you", "04:27", "you are able to store up oxygen far more", "04:30", "that you ever used before so in case", "04:33", "when you need it to regulate the", "04:36", "chemistry inside the body then it needs", "04:38", "oxygen then you we are all able with", "04:41", "these breathing exercises to get it", "04:44", "anywhere where the chemistry is messed", "04:46", "up and a chemistry messed up will send", "04:51", "off a signal but we are not emotionally", "04:54", "not listening because we get our worries", "04:56", "and we need to do the deadline and this", "04:58", "and data so we are not in and then this", "05:01", "chemistry stays over there and and will", "05:04", "deregulate the system and then we become", "05:08", "sick and we don't know what's happening", "05:10", "we go to the doctor and or the", "05:13", "psychiatrist because we could become a", "05:15", "depressed and all but we are very able", "05:19", "to get into any place in the body and in", "05:24", "this case the the brain or where and we", "05:28", "do all these studies now with the", "05:29", "university they say cognitive therapy", "05:33", "just talking to each other in the", "05:35", "psychology and psychotherapy that's not", "05:38", "enough that was a conference with 200", "05:41", "experts and they did this breathing and", "05:44", "then they so wow they're talking it's", "05:49", "not enough but if you do this breathing", "05:51", "then you really get into the brain not", "05:54", "suddenly you get a sense of control", "05:56", "because you're creating this extra", "05:58", "circulation of blood yes to get up with", "06:01", "oxygen making it alkaline then suddenly", "06:05", "the blockage is created because of wrong", "06:07", "chemistry because of trauma or anxiety", "06:12", "or grief then suddenly it that chemistry", "06:17", "is being dealt with and you get balanced", "06:20", "hmm simple and we keep it simple and and", "06:25", "and try to get this web of our thoughts", "06:28", "thinking of so many difficulties and", "06:31", "complication", "06:32", "what is emotion what is fear what is", "06:34", "PTSD what is trauma what is depression", "06:37", "we don't know where it is in the brain", "06:39", "just get all", "06:41", "the brain full of oxygen get a get", "06:43", "alkalinity up and you are able to steer", "06:47", "by going through the spine up in your", "06:50", "head and do it all is that why I believe", "06:53", "is that why some studies have shown that", "06:55", "a rigorous exercise particularly cardio", "06:58", "like running elliptical machines things", "07:00", "along like those lines are just as good", "07:02", "for depression as medication absolutely", "07:06", "absolutely it it's dealing with the", "07:08", "oxygen and attention they enforcing when", "07:11", "you think those giant deep breaths you", "07:13", "take when you're jogging or yes yes and", "07:16", "when you do they're staying so you", "07:18", "actually create a the body to be", "07:21", "effective with the oxygen then suddenly", "07:25", "different mechanisms are at work more", "07:28", "oxygen is coming in and the chemistry is", "07:31", "balancing out a depression is caused by", "07:35", "a wrong chemistry
