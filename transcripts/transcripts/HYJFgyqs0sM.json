you there there would be some grass", "28:00", "Kade but yeah there'd be some perception", "28:03", "that I haven't seen another one like me", "28:04", "in a very long time and then it would",

can happen in the while and we", "29:32", "just haven't seen it but it's well known", "29:34", "in reef fish like there are a lot of", "29:36", "species of reef fish that and it goes", "29:39", "both

idea that sex in human", "47:31", "beings has taken on these other", "47:33", "important roles in pair-bonding for", "47:36", "example is very special and the fact", "47:41", "that it continues after

"48:30", "so that at the point we get to the", "48:31", "discussion about what what do we do", "48:33", "about modernity that we are not you know", "48:36", "playing with toys we're actually talking", "48:38", "about the real stuff mmm this modernity", "48:45", "I mean the way human beings represent", "48:48", "sexuality or the way sexuality is", "48:50", "represented what's wrong with it",

red-blooded", "49:10", "male okay I would like you to conjure", "49:14", "the image in your mind of a woman who is", "49:20", "not beautiful but is hot hmm okay can", "49:25", "you do it sure okay can you conjure the", "49:28", "image of a woman who is beautiful but", "49:31", "not hot yes no problem no problem", "49:34", "me either this I think actually is a", "49:38", "window into much that is wrong with what", "49:41", "we think about human sexuality I think", "49:46", "most people if you asked them without", "49:48", "doing that little experiment to conjure", "49:52", "or to define what what it is for", "49:56", "somebody to be hot you would get answers", "49:59", "and people would tell you that hot was", "50:00", "sort of like the height of beauty right", "50:03", "which is very frightening if that's true", "50:06", "because hotness wanes with age it", "50:09", "deteriorates just can't help it the", "50:12", "discovery that beauty actually is a", "50:15", "different parameter tells a whole", "50:17", "different story about what's going on", "50:20", "with us people with men and with women", "50:23", "and I think both men and women are", "50:26", "confused by this so if it is true and I", "50:30", "I mean I know it is true I can look", "50:32", "inside my own mind and I can say that at", "50:34", "least for some and it is true the beauty", "50:36", "and hotness are almost on", "50:38", "or elated there are people who have both", "50:39", "traits but I I have no trouble seeing", "50:44", "that image of a woman who is hot but not", "50:46", "the least bit beautiful and I know lots", "50:49", "of women who are beautiful and not hot", "50:51", "and I also if I take the category of", "50:54", "women who are beautiful but not hot", "50:58", "there are a lot of older women in it", "51:01", "right I know women in their 60s and 70s", "51:05", "who have poise have aged gracefully", "51:08", "their gray as can be they may be", "51:11", "wrinkled but if you talk to them one", "51:14", "does have the sense I'm talking to a", "51:15", "beautiful person right and I'm not I'm", "51:18", "not being maudlin here if it was just a", "51:20", "simple fact that both beauty and hotness", "51:22", "waned with age I would say so but it is", "51:25", "not the case so what's going on why do", "51:28", "we have these two categories and why do", "51:30", "we assume I mean if you look at", "51:32", "advertising you will get the message", "51:35", "that hotness is where it's at right huh", "51:39", "this is the thing it's the only standard", "51:41", "possible it's the only standard and so", "51:44", "women are aspiring to it and then", "51:47", "they're fighting it as it wanes and all", "51:49", "of this and here's what I suspect is up", "51:53", "because males are males they have I want", "51:59", "to say they have two reproductive", "52:00", "strategies really they have three", "52:01", "reproductive strategies and one of them", "52:03", "is so awful that it's really just", "52:07", "unpleasant to even enter it into the", "52:09", "discussion but YouTube yep yeah so the", "52:13", "first reproductive strategy that men", "52:15", "have the one that would generally have", "52:17", "succeeded and that by the way we can", "52:19", "talk about monogamy versus polyamory and", "52:22", "all of that at some point but I'm not", "52:24", "saying anything that is inherent it's", "52:26", "not inherently about monogamy the way", "52:29", "males have typically reproduced is they", "52:32", "have invested in their offspring and the", "52:35",

"good evidence for it on a lot of fronts", "53:06", "and one of the points against it is that", "53:08", "we remain somewhat sexually dimorphic", "53:10", "that men are on average a bit taller a",

"53:34", "said something that was unclear at the", "53:35", "beginning there has been a lot of", "53:37", "polygamy where one male has multiple", "53:40", "females in human history probably the", "53:41", "majority of human cultures have been", "53:44", "polygynous yes the majority of people on", "53:46", "earth today belong to cultures that are", "53:48", "at least nominally monogamous and we", "53:50", "should talk about what that shift is and", "53:52", "what it means to us and what's desirable", "53:54", "and all of that but the basic point that", "53:59", "human babies are so expensive and", "54:01", "difficult to raise that you need a team", "54:04", "to do it and you know in part this is a", "54:07", "chicken and egg question it's not a good", "54:09", "term because it's quite clear which came", "54:12", "first but the this is a situation where", "54:16", "the when you have a team you can also", "54:17", "afford to have a baby that's more needy", "54:19", "and there are there's nothing good about", "54:21", "a needy baby but there is something good", "54:23", "about what you can get if you can", "54:25", "tolerate a needy baby you can get a baby", "54:27",

"55:17", "a partner in raising an offspring so how", "55:20", "does birth control factor into that well", "55:21", "we'll get there in a second but let's", "55:23", "just get the two strategies on the

a", "56:06", "woman who is broadcasting hotness all", "56:10", "right and so anyway the the thing that I", "56:16", "think is most important about this is we", "56:19", "now live in a culture where we have", "56:22", "advertisers essentially creating a kind", "56:26", "of insecurity because insecurity causes", "56:28", "people to spend money they otherwise", "56:29", "wouldn't that insecurity has

hear them at the", "61:46", "same time it's whale hunting and", "61:48", "smelting of ores Wow yeah keep quenching", "61:54", "it a thing by accident yeah so I think", "61:59", "you know the answer to the question you", "62:01", "asked is that the whole system has been", "62:03", "hijacked by the novelty of our current", "62:08", "circumstances and mmm what I was trying", "62:10", "to get at before is that the size of the", "62:16", "wind of an ancestral male who reproduced", "62:18", "with a female that didn't require", "62:20", "investment from them the size of that", "62:23", "win is so great that it causes men to", "62:26", "default to thinking about that when it", "62:30", "appears to be available and so in a", "62:32", "world where there's birth control and", "62:34", "therefore the stakes for women for", "62:36", "having sex have been greatly reduced and", "62:39", "therefore more women are interested in", "62:41", "having sex without commitment", "62:43", "the problem is men don't really know", "62:45", "what they're looking for because there", "62:47", "is this this level of triggering that", "62:51", "they cannot overcome and so the other", "62:54", "point I want to make on this front is", "62:57", "yes men are interested in sexual", "63:00", "pleasure as are women men and women are", "63:03", "overlapping but distinct in what that", "63:06", "means but I think if we were to say hey", "63:11", "sexual pleasure is awesome", "63:13", "and you should live your life so as to", "63:18", "maybe not maximize it but come close to", "63:21", "maximizing it that sexual pleasure is so", "63:23", "desirable that you should live your life", "63:25", "in a way that you get as much of that", "63:26", "thing as you can that would not", "63:28", "necessarily say that the way to do it", "63:30", "was to go around bangin strangers right", "63:33", "because there this is a multi-faceted", "63:37", "phenomenon and there is one thing that", "63:41", "gets left out of this discussion almost", "63:43", "every time I hear people talk about it", "63:45", "which is that the sex that one has when", "63:48", "the stakes are really high right when", "63:51", "you're really into somebody that's", "63:54", "that's a very pleasurable kind of sex", "63:57", "that is not reproduced by low-stakes", "63:59", "situation and so we are comparing things", "64:03", "and it sounds like well sexual pleasure", "64:06", "is what you're after then more sex is", "64:08", "certainly the way to get there but you", "64:09", "know that tends to look like the", "64:12", "argument tends to be more sex with more", "64:13", "people more varied sex partners is the", "64:16", "obvious way to optimize sexual pleasure", "64:18", "and actually that assumption hasn't been", "64:22", "investigated and wasn't it difficult to", "64:25", "accomplish", "64:25", "what is that why it's not it's hasn't", "64:28", "really been investigated I mean how many", "64:29", "people are having sex with multiple", "64:31", "partners and taking notes and being", "64:33", "studied well I don't know I mean college", "64:35", "students you know right but tell you", "64:37", "anything for 50 bucks so there are lots", "64:39", "of these studies that you know do", "64:41", "involve asking a lot of a college", "64:42", "student which is not you know it's not a", "64:43", "very broad sample but but again this is", "64:45", "a fairly new phenomenon in the last you", "64:47", "know five six decades where you could do", "64:49", "it and not worry about reproducing well", "64:52", "yeah so the question really is if we", "64:54", "step back from our own lives and we say", "64:58", "what what would the rules be if I wanted", "65:02", "to maximize this set of things if I", "65:06", "wanted to get these values out of my", "65:08", "life how would I alter my behavior I", "65:11", "don't think you would come up with a sex", "65:15", "with strangers is the answer to all of", "65:17", "this in fact I think sex with strangers", "65:19", "is it's pretty low-grade in terms of", "65:23", "what it delivers so so there are some", "65:26", "cultures that encourage a lot of early", "65:30", "fooling around between between", "65:33", "individuals and it's considered low", "65:36", "stakes and it stops at some point and", "65:38", "that's that's one thing that what's", "65:40", "going on in modern American culture is", "65:43", "there's no endpoint it's just considered", "65:46", "a good that more sex with more strangers", "65:49", "is inherently going to result in more", "65:50", "pleasure and therefore if we're actually", "65:52", "interested in sexual pleasure that's", "65:54", "what we should be doing and if you if", "65:55", "you look at cultures that have taken", "65:57", "sexual pleasure seriously if you look at", "66:00", "like tantric sex right it isn't about", "66:03", "sex with strangers it's about", "66:06", "cultivating a sec", "66:07", "a relationship that increases sexual", "66:09", "pleasure to an extreme height that you", "66:12", "won't reach if you aren't careful in", "66:15", "architecting it so in other words it's", "66:16", "about delayed gratification I mean", "66:18", "really that's the missing idea here is", "66:21", "that delayed gratification is actually a", "66:23", "strong contributor to sexual pleasure", "66:25", "isn't this sex with strangers thing", "66:28", "attractive because it's difficult to", "66:30", "accomplish is that part of it well I", "66:33", "said it's for men but not very difficult", "66:37", "to accomplish for women right not that", "66:39", "attractive to women", "66:40", "not nearly as attractive to women as it", "66:42", "is to men that it should be attractive", "66:45", "to I states in the city very much so", "66:48", "yeah and it's because it's imagined that", "66:51", "symmetry is equality okay", "66:53", "right and that's and that's I mean I", "66:55", "think that's maybe one of the main", "66:56", "things we're pushing back against here", "66:58", "is that we are not making the claim that", "67:00", "one sex is better than the other but the", "67:03", "idea that we are identical is absurd on", "67:05", "its face well in our culture today one", "67:08", "of the things that is a big stand out as", "67:11", "being very novel is social media this is", "67:14", "a completely new thing and this social", "67:17", "media also being used to attract sex", "67:20", "partners is a very new thing I mean I", "67:22", "had a whole bit in my last act my mum", "67:25", "the last Netflix special about some girl", "67:27", "who lives in Florida who has not she", "67:29", "probably has 9 billion people on her", "67:32", "Instagram now she had 9 million", "67:34",

people focusing on her ass so this", "67:56", "why why is she doing it there's an", "67:57", "attention but she's getting attention", "67:59", "I'm sure there's an economic benefit to", "68:01", "it too but that came later the attention", "68:04", "came first she didn't embark on this", "68:06", "journey like going I know what I'll do", "68:08", "I'm gonna figure out how to make money", "68:10",

play it right but some", "68:21", "number of people play it well and but", "68:23", "but again I so there is what I would", "68:28", "call a 2-way failure of empathy so", "68:31", "you'll give me a little a little leash", "68:33", "here we empathize with another", "68:37", "individual by using our own minds and", "68:41", "whatever it is that we have as the", "68:43", "content of our minds and

grew up", "69:03", "Heather and I both grew up in LA there's", "69:06", "a certain amount of stuff that we can", "69:08", "intuit about what the other would think", "69:10", "about something just based on the fact", "69:11", "that we grew up in the same period in", "69:13", "the same place", "69:14", "but males and females there there's a", "69:17", "place where we top out and we can't", "69:19", "understand what the other is is", "69:22", "experiencing because it is very unlike", "69:25", "what we would experience so for example", "69:27", "if if you were walking down the street",

somewhere and", "69:40", "you walk by and they're like look at", "69:44", "that that's one fine hunk of man how do", "69:48", "you feel uh yeah whew you feel pretty", "69:53", "good I don't feel threatened does the", "69:55", "certainly don't feel there's a", "69:56", "difference between a man experiencing", "69:58", "that with women is I'm not gonna get", "70:00", "gang-raped yeah but do you feel good", "70:01", "yeah yeah sure of course you would right", "70:04", "you feel to implement it right but the", "70:06", "it's very different with the opposite", "70:08", "sex because there's no threat it's very", "70:10", "different for the with the opposite sex", "70:12", "not only because it lets neutralize the", "70:14", "threat part of it which is I mean it's", "70:16", "it's you it's for sure but there's other", "70:18", "stuff going on too but here's the part", "70:20", "that I think men don't into it until", "70:21", "somebody points it out to them because", "70:24", "men have two different reproductive", "70:25", "strategies and one of them is about", "70:28", "long-term investment and the other one", "70:30", "is about have sex with them", "70:33", "pregnant them and never see them again", "70:34", "when a man whistles at a woman right and", "70:39", "he compliments essentially how hot she", "70:41", "looks he is essentially offering to", "70:44", "stick her with a child that will then be", "70:47", "her responsibility for the better part", "70:50", "of two decades that's not a very nice", "70:53", "compliment right well that's a weird way", "70:55", "of looking at it", "70:56", "I agree with you but I see exactly where", "70:59", "you're going with that but man I never", "71:00", "thought about it that way before and I", "71:01", "don't think most people have either well", "71:03", "that this is my point though it's right", "71:04", "in front of us mmm there's another thing", "71:07", "too so you've just identified you know a", "71:10", "single guy kept calling maybe right but", "71:12", "a woman walking past a construction site", "71:15", "and getting five six seven guys", "71:18", "whistling who are those calls for not", "71:22", "necessarily for her it's communication", "71:24", "between the men yeah", "71:25", "it's they're signaling they're not gay", "71:28", "there's no signal to each other hey did", "71:30", "you see that

this thing is almost a", "71:38", "nonentity but it feels totally personal", "71:41", "and yet it's not necessarily about the", "71:43", "woman and so you know all the discussion", "71:45", "of oh my god these catcalls are awful", "71:47", "and it's just it's a pain in the ass to", "71:49", "walk down the street and have to deal", "71:50", "with it", "71:50", "for a young woman it's true but it's", "71:53", "also ignoring the fact of it being", "71:55", "communication between men and you know", "71:57", "should they stop probably but but it's", "72:01", "not just about male/female

sisters or you don't have", "72:13", "any daughters and if you if you have all", "72:16", "those things you're some kind of a", "72:18", "monster like if you have a mother that", "72:20", "you love and a sister that you love and", "72:23", "if you have daughters and you still", "72:25", "catcall at some woman walking down the", "72:28", "street there's something really wrong", "72:30", "with you oh but so when I stay oh I", "72:35", "think it's it's very very wrong", "72:37", "but it doesn't work it is also so common", "72:40", "yeah I mean it must can't or must work", "72:42", "okay it works to let the other guys know", "72:44", "you're not gay right so that's know", "72:45", "that's part of", "72:46", "I even do that now let's mean this is", "72:49", "interesting because I think this is", "72:50", "something actually Heather probably", "72:52", "won't into it either but I'm wondering", "72:54", "if you'll spot it when I when I mention", "72:56", "it which is there is a part of being a", "73:00", "male that because I mean the thing is", "73:03", "most males in history are losers who", "73:07", "didn't reproduce right reproduction was", "73:09", "not that easy to accomplish in human", "73:11", "history it was way easier to starve or", "73:14", "die on a battlefield or a lot of other", "73:16", "things so the there is a way in which", "73:22", "there's a part of the male psyche that", "73:26", "plays very remote possibilities right", "73:30", "and you know it's weird if you're", "73:32", "talking about being in a city and", "73:34", "construction workers sitting on a girder", "73:36", "whistling at somebody walking by if we", "73:39", "calculate the chances that any one of", "73:41", "them end up actually in a conversation", "73:43", "with her the chances are pretty low but", "73:46", "if you imagine that those guys are", "73:47", "actually acting from a mind that evolved", "73:50", "in much smaller circumstances a small", "73:53", "town where everybody knew everybody and", "73:55", "so whatever it is in their mind that", "73:56", "causes them to have these interactions", "73:59", "would have been much more likely there", "74:01", "would be later interactions with the", "74:02", "same person and so I think that a male", "74:06", "that is not thinking carefully about", "74:09", "what they are doing ends up you know", "74:12", "flirting with and basically building a", "74:17", "rapport that is about some future", "74:20", "potential that's almost certain never to", "74:23", "be realized but it makes sense to", "74:26", "cultivate because you know if you", "74:29", "cultivate a thousand tiny little", "74:32", "potentials and almost all of them go", "74:34", "bust but occasionally one works out", "74:36", "that's a win so the point is the cost is", "74:38", "small and you know you never know the", "74:41", "woman who gets catcalled", "74:43", "might I can't even imagine the", "74:47", "circumstance that whole you never know", "74:50", "it's like just dig a hole in the middle", "74:51", "of this tree you might find gold I mean", "74:54", "it seems like a Hail Mary but yes", "74:56", "sometimes Hail Marys work yeah", "74:59", "happening sometime in history but if you", "75:01", "had to look at the numbers they're", "75:03", "probably pretty staggering yeah well", "75:04", "okay so I mean as long as we're in this", "75:07", "territory yes it must have happened in", "75:10", "history but so many things that were", "75:11", "very remote contingencies in history", "75:15", "have apparently produced offspring like", "75:17",

"75:33", "this way no one on me you usually talk", "75:36", "about fixation so were you talking about", "75:39", "well actually I wasn't talking about", "75:40", "that but it's a better example it shows", "75:42", "you that there's some part um what do", "75:44", "you mean then I mean think about", "75:46", "actually secure I think grammatically I", "75:48", "mean being hanged right being hanged", "75:50", "yeah I'm so confused", "75:53", "I one day done I'm working from anecdote", "75:57", "here I have read that I but I don't know", "75:58", "how many's people checking the underwear", "76:00", "people just got hung but my point would", "76:03", "be what has to be true in order for such", "76:07", "a pattern to evolve so let's take our", "76:09", "erotic fixation de Lyonne strategy

you know the generous", "146:42", "interpretation and the evolutionary", "146:44", "interpretation of what he said was look", "146:48", "the me2 movement is arguing that there", "146:51", "should be

minutes", "147:58", "of him talking about what happened I do", "148:01", "think Peterson who I also know I don't", "148:04", "think any give us a cliff notes of what", "148:05", "yeah I mean the cliff

"166:34", "together and that means that instead of", "166:36", "looking for the perfect partner who's", "166:38", "exactly the right fit for you two people", "166:40", "who had the right starting material sort", "166:42", "of grew together into a partnership the", "166:45", "growing together up together yeah that's", "166:47", "a that's a big part and there's a lot of", "166:50", "people that don't spend a lot of time", "166:51", "with their mates you know and you know", "166:54", "people grow apart too you guys get lucky", "166:56", "yeah that's true yeah I've got a lot of", "166:58", "friends living in hell yeah that's", "167:01", "terrible", "167:01", "yeah it's unfortunately a really common", "167:04", "it is more common than not you guys are", "167:06", "the outliers right what scientists", "167:09", "taking your kids to the jungle well but", "167:13", "but okay here's the thing I don't know", "167:15", "because I've only lived one life but I I", "167:17", "think there is a lesson because I think", "167:20", "that what we did actually was fairly", "167:22", "simple which was we played it by ear and", "167:26", "the stuff that didn't work we chucked it", "167:28", "and the stuff that did work we augmented", "167:30", "it and so there were no hard and fast", "167:32", "rules yeah you're also exceptional", "167:35", "people you're both very unusually smart", "167:37", "and open-minded well thank each other we", "167:41", "found each other and I think I think", "167:42", "open-minded is more important than smart", "167:43", "in this case all right like being able", "167:46", "to look at each other with compassion", "167:48", "you know this is true for any indirect", "167:50", "right let's I look at you and see you as", "167:54", "a human being with real emotions and", "167:56", "feelings and reality to your experiences", "167:58", "as well even if I feel like we disagree", "168:01", "completely so even you know even when", "168:03", "we're at our angriest with each other if", "168:06", "we can see each other's humanity through", "168:08", "it and you get through you know that", "168:11", "that is a lesson for every human being", "168:14", "in all walks of life in any situation", "168:16", "when you disagree with someone not just", "168:18", "your lover not just a friend but people", "168:21", "that you don't even know it's it's very", "168:23", "easy to dehumanize someone who disagrees", "168:26", "with you and I think to bring this all", "168:28", "back around this is a part of the", "168:31", "problem with male-female interaction",

rash", "168:44", "generalizations in this extreme", "168:46", "tribalism well there is kind of a secret", "168:53", "weapon and I it's not let us check it", "168:56", "out the secret is Heather and I have a", "169:00", "whole second channel on which to", "169:02", "navigate which is that we both know the", "169:05", "same evolutionary story yeah so there's", "169:08", "a way you know there's an idea that's", "169:10", "important you can very often understand", "169:13", "more about a given human interaction", "169:16", "especially a contentious one if you turn", "169:18", "down the sound alright so you can't hear", "169:21", "what's being said and that sounds wrong", "169:23", "right it sounds like well I mean the", "169:25", "most important piece of information you", "169:27", "could have is what these people are", "169:28", "saying to each other", "169:29", "as they're arguing but no that's not how", "169:31", "human beings work sometimes the", "169:34", "important information is on that vocal", "169:36", "channel and sometimes the vocal channel", "169:38", "is actually almost purely noise right", "169:42", "and so if both literally and", "169:44", "metaphorically yeah but if Heather and I", "169:47", "both know that then there's a part of us", "169:50", "that sort of always outside if we I mean", "169:52", "we don't fight that much it's really", "169:54", "pretty rare but when we do there's also", "169:57", "a part of us that's watching the", "169:59", "interaction and", "170:01", "knows that a certain pattern may have to", "170:05", "unfold in order for us to get to the", "170:07", "other part of it you know sometimes", "170:08", "knowing that we're engaging in theater", "170:10", "at some level even though neither of us", "170:12", "wants to be that's a great way to put it", "170:13", "engaging in couples theater it's", "170:19", "actually it's the perfect example of", "170:21", "this thing like you know you're talking", "170:22", "about Peterson and going to work and", "170:24", "wearing makeup and you think am i", "170:26", "sending sexual signals well gosh we're", "170:28", "all involved in weird stuff sure right", "170:30", "yeah the idea that you and your mate", "170:32", "could both be aware that your argument", "170:35", "is in some in some way theater and that", "170:38", "even you know you might think well if", "170:39", "it's theatre we can just skip it", "170:41", "now you can't know there are things that", "170:44", "have to happen in order for you to get", "170:46", "to the next act and so you know it", "170:49", "they're like I hope I'm not saying", "170:52", "something I shouldn't but there's a", "170:53", "there's a thing I'm not the easiest guy", "170:55", "to live with I think I'm a very decent", "170:58", "person but there's a part of me that's", "171:04", "not good at certain stuff that makes", "171:06", "Heather's life hard right and that stuff", "171:09", "she's good at putting up with it to a", "171:11", "certain extent and then there's things", "171:12", "that will cause it to get even to get", "171:15", "bad I need to know that that's happened", "171:19", "in order for us to get past it and she", "171:21", "needs to tell me hey this isn't the", "171:24", "normal level of you know I'm not really", "171:26", "frustrated considering exploding right", "171:30", "right so but doesn't sound that call the", "171:32", "the necessity of us being able to", "171:34", "exchange that information is there and", "171:37", "the fact you know it's it's so much less", "171:41", "charged if we both know that sort of", "171:43", "that process has to unfold and that is", "171:45", "not an infinite process and we will be", "171:47", "on the other side of it once you know I", "171:49", "she's conveyed what she needs to convey", "171:52", "and I've let her know that I've heard it", "171:53", "and again the more times you've done", "171:55", "this the more likely you are confident", "171:57", "you know what this is gonna end up okay", "171:58", "this feels awful right now like really", "172:00", "are fighting and this feels awful and", "172:02", "right we've done this before and", "172:04", "actually this proves to be necessary", "172:06", "because it resets some things that you", "172:08", "know just every relationship no matter", "172:09", "if it's romantic or not needs resets on", "172:12", "their basis and so this is this is one", "172:14", "way that you can sort of theatrically", "172:16", "reset some important points this is a", "172:19", "great lesson for reasonable people and", "172:22", "everybody should aspire to be reasonable", "172:24", "people is intended at that all right I", "172:27", "just did three hours I just flew right", "172:29", "by right Wow awesome
