those kinds of things I", "03:19", "mentioned the Alfred Russel Wallace who", "03:22", "was the co-discoverer of natural", "03:23", "selection with Darwin I wrote my", "03:25", "dissertation on him and wrote a", "03:26", "biography of him and he was quite the", "03:27", "colorful character who was so", "03:29", "open-minded to new ideas that he was", "03:31", "also gullible so open-minded enough to", "03:34", "see this radical new theory of the", "03:36", "evolution of life by natural selection", "03:37", "that's good pioneered other fields like", "03:40", "biogeography and so on but he also was", "03:44", "really into spiritualism and phrenology", "03:47", "seances handling all that stuff and then", "03:52", "he encountered an ad in one of the", "03:54", "Natural History magazines for this 500", "03:57", "pound bet if anybody could prove the", "03:59", "earth is round so he devised the test", "04:02", "and he went down to the Bedford Canal", "04:04", "which is a long straight like 10 10", "04:06", "kilometers long you can see the whole", "04:08", "distance and if you put these little", "04:10", "sticks in the ground with markers on", "04:12", "them and you get a little telescope like", "04:14", "a surveyors scope and you line it up you", "04:18", "can see that it bends so at each point", "04:20", "the stick is you know three meters above", "04:23", "the ground if you", "04:24", "point and but you can see that it's", "04:26", "dropped down in the last one so it's", "04:27", "bent so he won the bet", "04:29", "but he didn't get paid of course because", "04:31", "these people are cranks and so we had to", "04:33", "take him to court this ended up costing", "04:35", "him about fifteen years of his career", "04:37", "you know it's wasting time you know", "04:39", "writing letters and getting court dates", "04:41", "and suing this guy and you know what", "04:43", "does it try to win the bet yeah just try", "04:44", "to win the bet so and of course what", "04:47", "happens you get caught up emotionally", "04:49", "like I'm not gonna let this bastard get", "04:50", "away with this yeah you should've just", "04:52", "cut his losses and laughs but anyway and", "04:54", "I found these letters that this guy", "04:56", "wrote to the National jigger are they", "04:57", "the Royal Geographical Society about", "05:01", "Alfred Russel Wallace you know you have", "05:03", "one member of your society that should", "05:06", "be you know he's a quack and a crank and", "05:08", "you know and he wrote letters to the two", "05:10", "Wallace's wife you know you better not", "05:12", "sleep in your bed at night quietly", "05:14", "because I'm coming to get you guys it's", "05:15", "like Oh like death threats yeah so you", "05:18", "know it's always questionable to deal", "05:20", "with cranks because some of them are a", "05:22", "little mentally deranged sure and they", "05:25", "can attach themselves to someone like", "05:28", "Wallace or Darwin or anybody else if you", "05:30", "can somehow or another connect yourself", "05:32", "to them and some sort of an argument", "05:34", "it's kind of legitimizes you at least in", "05:36", "a way because that person's giving you", "05:38", "attention and that purse is engaging you", "05:40", "and it elevates your standing and then", "05:42", "whenever two people are arguing a", "05:44",
