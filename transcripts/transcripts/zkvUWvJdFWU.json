"of them interesting BAM", "27:36", "it says that that the pancreas thing", "27:37", "came out of a wrestling organization in", "27:40", "Japan or they had like they were having", "27:42", "problems with predetermined outcomes", "27:45", "decided to have actual fights Funaki", "27:48", "interesting yeah and then you look at", "27:50", "Hickson versus Funaki crazy amid fucking", "27:53", "difference in grappling oh you know what", "27:55", "I mean it's big as it gets", "27:57", "yeah so you could see that so what the", "28:01", "UFC did that Pancrase didn't do and", "28:07", "mainly because nobody in the Western", "28:11", "Hemisphere even knew what the fuck it", "28:13", "was it was a Japanese thing so it's", "28:15", "gonna be hard to change the world when", "28:17", "you're

"weird Japanese stores and and and see", "28:28", "that so but the UFC made it clear that", "28:31", "the Brazilians", "28:33", "were doing a form of ground fighting", "28:35", "that was", "28:37", "beyond and more sophisticated than what", "28:42", "we're seeing in Japan or anywhere else", "28:44", "in the world", "28:44", "you know nobody anybody knew nobody in", "28:46", "half the shit they were doing no Zombo", "28:48", "add it down Samba has some good shit and", "28:50", "judo", "28:51", "yes judo most if not all Brazilian", "28:57", "jiu-jitsu moves I mean have been done in", "28:59", "judo and they're actually they came from", "29:01", "judo we know that the Japanese know that", "29:04", "but a lot of American judo guys don't", "29:07", "they can't they can't seem to grasp AK", "29:09", "they're like you know the Gracie's", "29:11", "ripped off a new aza it's all about", "29:14", "nuance at least you know there was a you", "29:16", "know sect of judo where they did focus", "29:20", "on the ground but and that's all true", "29:23", "but the major difference is the", "29:26", "Brazilians they wanted to do a style", "29:28", "where there wasn't a time limit on the", "29:30", "ground in judo you could only fight on", "29:33", "the ground for I don't know 30 seconds", "29:34", "it's a it's limited it's not that much", "29:36", "time so when you don't have that much", "29:38", "time there's a lot of shit you don't", "29:42", "need to waste your time drilling because", "29:44", "you're only gonna be down there for 30", "29:46", "seconds you need to focus on the moves", "29:48", "that work in 30 seconds and that's it", "29:50", "you don't have time to set shit up and", "29:52", "be patient and relax", "29:54", "you can't clinch and catch your breath", "29:56", "you got it it's gotta you got to go into", "29:58", "it so what the Brazilians did is just", "30:02", "allowed the fight to unfold on the", "30:04", "ground and and not have any stand-ups", "30:06", "and just let them fight on the ground", "30:07", "and when that happens there's a lot", "30:11", "there's so much more you can do when", "30:14", "there's no time limit on the ground not", "30:15", "like no time I mean you know they're not", "30:17", "gonna stay without stand-ups where you", "30:19", "could just most of the matches take is", "30:21", "takes place on the ground the game just", "30:24", "evolves so quickly and so rapidly and", "30:27", "and that you can't compare like Japanese", "30:31", "guys come down in Brazil they'd been", "30:33", "doing judo their whole life and they get", "30:34", "smoked by Brazilians that always happens", "30:37", "in the World Championships the", "30:38", "Brazilians are just on the ground all", "30:40", "day you know and the guys that do judo", "30:42", "they're on the ground a little bit", "30:44", "they're never gonna be able to compete", "30:45", "in a sport where there's no stand-ups", "30:48", "you know so to", "30:50", "say that Brazilian Jujitsu is just judo", "30:54", "it's that you got to think about it it's", "31:02", "silly there's so many silly connections", "31:04", "that people have to arts you know I mean", "31:07", "there's there's people that legitimately", "31:09", "think that why people shouldn't be able", "31:10", "to teach karate because it's cultural", "31:12", "appropriation because it's a Japanese", "31:14", "art there's people that think that's", "31:16", "stupid you know this I think all of its", "31:19", "martial arts now I mean I think the", "31:21", "roots and the bases are very important",

this", "31:59", "point it's really I mean ultimately it's", "32:04", "one thing now ultimately Eltham", "32:07", "ultimately like when you even think", "32:08", "about UFC when you think about just", "32:10", "Bruce Lee movies what is it like fight", "32:13", "how what's the best way to fight it's", "32:15", "all together now it's all combined", "32:17", "because the best way is not just",
