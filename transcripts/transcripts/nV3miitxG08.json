always hear that as", "06:01", "an example like I heard you blew the", "06:03", "roof he was the guy that ended it all", "06:06", "like literally because I think they gave", "06:08", "him a half a million dollars or", "06:10", "something crazy like that I kind of want", "06:11", "to see this chicken set like what was", "06:14", "the set that just blew everyone's mind", "06:15", "he was a

way that like it was just a bunch of", "06:37", "black", "06:38", "but there was no substance to it there's", "06:41", "no thought to it so they tried to put it", "06:44", "together they tried to make like a", "06:46", "development deal and he did a little", "06:48", "touring but it all went south and it", "06:50", "fell apart he eventually committed", "06:51", "suicide do you know how many years he", "06:53", "was doing himself in front of a school", "06:55", "that's cool yeah like like that's what I", "06:58", "had heard like you hung himself on a", "07:00", "tree in front of a school geez

-", "07:09", "but I did but the hanging part is right", "07:11", "right yes he definitely committed", "07:13", "suicide which it's one of those things", "07:14", "men were like it if it didn't work out", "07:16", "and he didn't develop it didn't he", "07:19", "didn't he never became like a legit", "07:22", "comedian good thing all right over there", "07:23", "Jamie yeah I think if like if that had", "07:27", "happened and he actually had the equity", "07:30", "of a stand-up comedian and been doing it", "07:31", "for a long enough yes that would be like", "07:34", "a bump in the road but you can come back", "07:35", "from that oh yeah if that's just sort of", "07:37", "like your lotto ticket mmm then that's", "07:39", "why it was so drastic I think well some", "07:41", "people are just

"08:59", "failures so I'm kind of fortunate that I", "09:03", "would get some acting things here and", "09:04", "there but never anything substantial", "09:06", "enough to take me away from stand-up", "09:08", "well never anything substantial the", "09:10", "worst is when they tell you to stop", "09:11", "doing stand up because it's messing with", "09:12", "your acting role like that's they did a", "09:14", "Tim Allen oh really because his acting", "09:16", "it was you know he was on home", "09:19", "improvement it was a gigantic kit they", "09:20", "were making kazillion zuv dollars but he",

yeah yeah I think that's", "09:55", "you know maybe they did that at the time", "09:57", "but it's almost detrimental to let go", "09:59", "stand-up is your car like it's your", "10:01", "business you're in control over in the", "10:03", "TV stuff it's like one hand washes the", "10:05", "other", "10:05", "if you let that go you're letting go of", "10:07", "this revenue stream so that when the", "10:10", "acting gig is over you're kind of fucked", "10:12", "because this wasn't like building along", "10:14", "with it you know it also was a point of", "10:16", "confidence where you
