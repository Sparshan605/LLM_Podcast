was", "08:41", "he got a new lease of life like he got a", "08:44", "big dose locally in the hip which fixed", "08:48", "all his inflammation and pain and he", "08:50", "started walking again and his

and", "09:05", "other stuff improved that I he would", "09:07", "hate me to talk about but he had two", "09:11", "nurses that reported to me Wow using it", "09:18", "as a towel rack you know well

"11:59", "hundred percent I could do basically", "12:01", "everything right right yeah I was 57 58", "12:04", "years old", "12:05", "and this is like what four or five years", "12:07", "ago and both

United States well you can you the", "12:49", "only thing that's legally legal in the", "12:51", "US at least for now I don't think it's", "12:53", "gonna be lasts much longer is from", "12:55",

"13:12", "because this Commissioner FDA", "13:15", "commissioners made it very clear that he", "13:16", "doesn't like it and and they really", "13:18", "haven't liked it for quite some time", "13:20",

come out they've gone after clinics", "13:38", "and you know I think they've shut down", "13:39", "three places and just in the last couple", "13:41", "of months and they haven't gone after", "13:43", "amnion yet but I think they're building", "13:45", "their case for it and unfortunately", "13:47", "that's what's going to happen so why", "13:49", "would they go after it that's what's", "13:51",

"14:09", "claims that people are making because", "14:11", "there there haven't been studies for", "14:13", "example of a me on you know a me on", "14:15", "tissue injected into a joint and I think",

"14:36", "know we were the first in the world to", "14:38", "use fat derived stem cells in 2006 and", "14:41", "2007 we published in on using those to", "14:45", "treat rheumatoid arthritis and and", "14:47", "multiple sclerosis and then a lot of", "14:50", "doctors in the u.s. started doing that", "14:51", "now now there's a new guidance the", "14:54", "industry that came out a few months ago",

"15:19", "that's not gonna", "15:20", "fly anymore so the stuff that you did", "15:22", "for male shoulder what what exactly was", "15:24", "that that's basically a new drug product", "15:28", "it could be considered a new drug", "15:29", "product in the US and we are in clinical", "15:31", "trials in the u.s. we've already we have", "15:33", "to IND s for the treatment of Duchenne's", "15:35",

were", "15:55", "able to figure out which cells work", "15:57", "which which umbilical cords give cells", "15:59", "that are really useful and which ones", "16:01", "aren't so we throw away the vast",

one", "16:13", "case of a football coach from from", "16:17", "Dallas where I live and he had diagnosed", "16:20", "with MS he was in and out of wheelchair", "16:22", "was on you know basically out

difference", "17:10", "between those cells in 2012 and the ones", "17:13", "in 2011 and ones 2010 and then we took", "17:15", "other cases similar to that where we'd", "17:17", "had Lex less than spectacular results I", "17:20", "mean there's still good results but they", "17:21", "weren't you know but boom and so we took", "17:25", "cells from those different Lots and we", "17:28", "grew them up and then we had them", "17:29", "analyzed for 1200 different molecules", "17:32", "that they express", "17:33", "and we found that these cells we call", "17:35", "them are golden cells because they they", "17:37", "just seem to work all the time and we", "17:40", "found that they under expressed certain", "17:42", "proteins and then so early on in the", "17:44", "culture process we can select for those", "17:46", "and say hey these are golden cells these", "17:48", "aren't throw them out so we throw we", "17:49", "throw a whole bunch out and we keep the", "17:51", "golden cells and we grow those up and", "17:53", "that's those are the only cells that we", "17:54", "use so that that's the big the big", "17:57", "difference in the advantage we have is", "17:58", "that we've had all those cases were able", "18:00", "to look back retrospectively at which", "18:02", "cells really worked and analyze them", "18:04", "from a molecular basis and then now we", "18:07", "can select using that so when mail came", "18:10", "in with his shoulder injuries June an", "18:12", "MRI first he had one but we didn't do it", "18:16", "there but he had one yes did you do a", "18:17", "follow-up MRI we did not know we do it", "18:21", "feels great so you don't even bother", "18:22", "just good I don't bother it's like my", "18:24", "dad was walking with that pain right", "18:26", "you know his hip was dissolved he was", "18:28", "doing okay Wow and so are you still no", "18:32", "problems with your shoulder how are you", "18:33", "good you have that done", "18:34", "oh and was that I had it done twice it", "18:36", "was I I went 18 months and then I", "18:39", "started it started to return the", "18:42", "symptoms of discomfort pain and so I did", "18:44", "it again and like it's been like a", "18:47", "couple of years almost three years it's", "18:49", "fine", "18:49", "Wow yeah I was really impressed with", "18:53", "what I was able to get done but the", "18:55", "stuff that I wish I had dr. McGee", "18:57", "telling me exactly what it was the stuff", "19:00", "that he they had done to me about a year", "19:02", "and a half ago is no longer available", "19:04", "mm-hmm", "19:05", "they decided that it was considered a", "19:07", "drug and they weren't allowing that form", "19:11", "of amniotic stem cell treatment so now", "19:14", "there's a less effective but still", "19:16", "effective form right so it seems like", "19:18", "there is some sort of an effort afoot to", "19:20", "diminish this in the United States yeah", "19:22", "well I think they just want to control", "19:24", "it and they want you know they want it", "19:26", "all to go through their deal and and", "19:28", "their process but in the meantime a lot", "19:29", "of people are probably suffering from", "19:32", "some pretty significant injuries that", "19:33", "they could deal with with that far", "19:36", "easier if this could somehow another be", "19:38", "sped up I absolutely agree with that him", "19:40", "so when did you start doing this down in", "19:42", "Panama we started there in 2006", "19:46", "and just because of the regulations", "19:48", "right when we found out about the", "19:49", "regulations around 2006 and and we went", "19:52", "straight there once we found that law", "19:54", "the blot was passed in 2004 and then we", "19:58", "found out about it and we went down", "19:59", "there and we built our lab out we were", "20:01", "actually functional in 2007 so it's", "20:05", "we're having a 10 year anniversary", "20:07", "what's it like in Panama never been in", "20:09", "Panama is it weird seems like it's cool", "20:12", "that's cool", "20:13", "yeah it's very it's real friendly with", "20:16", "the US I think that's the currency you", "20:18", "spend there's US dollars oh really it", "20:20", "goes further yeah", "20:21", "they use u.s. dollars yeah oh yeah they", "20:24", "use u.s. dollars I mean we kind of ran", "20:26", "that joint for you know many years until", "20:28", "1999 when they would gave the canal back", "20:31", "and that was pretty much the vast", "20:33", "majority of the economy so we gave that", "20:34", "back to them then they just kept the", "20:36", "dollar and it's been you know the", "20:39", "explosive growth it looks like Miami now", "20:42", "it's there you know my billet the", "20:44", "building I live in is 70 stories tall", "20:46", "and it's not even the tallest building", "20:47", "you know so there's so they our clinic", "20:50", "is on the 63rd floor of a 65 storey", "20:52", "building they're just

a third of my time", "21:09", "down there that's friendly and it's", "21:11", "relative you know it's not dangerous Wow", "21:13", "so you have people that you that hear", "21:17", "about you from United States and they", "21:19", "find out about your your treatment and", "21:21", "then fly down to Panama to get treated", "21:22", "yeah that's right not not just the US", "21:24", "but the probably the majority that", "21:26", "clients are from the US and then we have", "21:28", "people from all other places around the", "21:32", "globe", "21:32", "do you anticipate this moving back to", "21:34", "the United States in any way or is this", "21:36", "something that the hurdles are so steep", "21:38", "that it's gonna take a long time I think", "21:41", "we're gonna figure out a way to do it", "21:42", "you know I think ultimately we're gonna", "21:44", "do it we're you know just having we were", "21:47", "the first to get an ion to treat a human", "21:49", "being in the United

that's hopefully", "21:58", "interesting to read it's", "22:00", "starts and finishes with his case where", "22:02", "we traded him in Panama for a number of", "22:05", "years and then we just

number going on the u.s. the biggest", "22:35", "hurdle is that a new drug if you look at", "22:39", "the last several years cost two and a", "22:40", "half billion dollars to get to market", "22:43",

"22:52", "went into effect two years ago that", "22:54", "basically allows you for allows you to", "22:57", "once you demonstrate your product is", "22:59", "safe then you can go ahead and start",

they", "23:27", "just being cautious they want to make", "23:28", "sure that there's no adverse side", "23:30", "effects that could really be significant", "23:31", "yeah I think there is an argument there", "23:34", "there's an argument that they want to", "23:35", "they want to err on the side of safety I", "23:37", "mean that's our number one priority is", "23:39", "to is to create create a safe", "23:42", "environment for receiving medicines in", "23:45", "the in the United States I think the", "23:48", "model is a little bit is a little bit", "23:50", "antiquated for the sell products

was", "24:25", "supposed to was supposed to address some", "24:27", "of that and we'll see that that went", "24:29", "into effect last year and we'll see", "24:31", "going forward if that actually does", "24:33", "affect things now I know that they're", "24:36", "doing some stuff in the United States", "24:38", "where they're injecting them into discs", "24:40", "this is a new thing to

"25:09", "Europe just came out a couple months ago", "25:11", "and it showed about 50% of the patients", "25:14", "had their discs become normal on MRI", "25:18", "after treatment so it's not every case", "25:20", "but I would I'd take a 50/50 shot versus", "25:22", "having to have an effusion right yeah so", "25:25", "that's the same sort of situation that", "25:26", "we're talking about where you're", "25:27", "injecting it right into the discs yeah", "25:29", "and you know you can in the United", "25:31", "States you know we have a clinic in", "25:32", "Dallas that the RMI clinic where we we", "25:37", "can do bone marrow right and and so we", "25:41", "use bone autologous bone marrow and we", "25:43", "do do the discs in the United States and", "25:45", "it does help a percentage of people", "25:47", "doesn't help everybody and like we were", "25:49", "talking before about not just not just", "25:51", "the disc but the muscles around the disc", "25:53", "so yeah you take somebody's had an", "25:55", "injury my partner dr. McKenna is a", "25:58", "orthopedic surgeon and he's been talking", "26:00", "about this for years but if you take", "26:02", "somebody with a disc injury and you look", "26:04", "at the muscles right on the either side", "26:05", "of the spine there and you'll find that", "26:07", "they're withered away or they're marbled", "26:09", "with fat and that's that sort of thing", "26:10", "you take an elite athlete something", "26:12", "super healthy works out all the time", "26:13", "those muscles they're like they're like", "26:15", "ropes that's a filet mignon of the human", "26:18", "body right and you look at that and", "26:19", "they're just black on MRI but you take", "26:22", "somebody that's had a disc injury at any", "26:24", "level and you can look and there's", "26:25", "marbling", "26:26", "there and it's withered and that sort of", "26:28", "thing so one of the things we do in in", "26:31", "South Lake and in Dallas is we inject", "26:34", "the disc but also inject those muscles", "26:36", "along the side and that's using your own", "26:38", "bone marrow and that's still allowed in", "26:40", "the United States so the bone marrow", "26:42", "draw that concentrate the stem cells and", "26:44", "inject them in those areas well that's", "26:46", "something that we were talking about", "26:47", "earlier when I showed you the reverse", "26:48", "hyper when I showed you that machine and", "26:50", "then that that dex back stretcher I", "26:52", "think that's a significant part of the", "26:54", "injuries that you see with people with", "26:55", "discs with back injuries", "26:57", "they don't have strong backs right there", "26:59", "they're the tissue the muscle around the", "27:01", "back that protects the spine is just", "27:03", "very weak right right yeah it's", "27:05", "fantastic machine I'm gonna get one yeah", "27:07", "you gotta get one too Mel yeah you got a", "27:10", "crazy back dude that picture you showed", "27:11", "me your back is fucking bananas yeah I", "27:16", "had done down in Texas yeah yeah no", "27:21", "actually had that done it and yeah in", "27:22", "Texas yeah how many treatments have you", "27:24", "had well there was that one and then I", "27:27", "had the shoulders twice and then I just", "27:31", "had them drop it into my vein you know", "27:33", "just run around what's that like that's", "27:35", "pretty cool I mean you feel a little", "27:37", "sleepy for a couple of days and then you", "27:39", "feel pretty energetic really sleeping", "27:41", "yeah they kind of I think it takes its", "27:44", "toll on you I mean I don't know why you", "27:47", "feel sleepy Neil may have an explanation", "27:49", "for that but yeah well we hear ya the", "27:52", "cells are going to kind of re educate", "27:54", "the immune system you know a lot like a", "27:55", "lot of what we treat our rheumatoid", "27:57", "arthritis and multiple sclerosis", "27:59", "autoimmune diseases and there's a", "28:01", "retraining that's going on in the immune", "28:03", "system and so that that involves", "28:06", "cytokines and those molecules those", "28:09", "peptides are the things that make you", "28:10", "feel sick I mean when you get the flu", "28:12", "the flu virus doesn't make you sick it's", "28:14", "your body's immune reaction to that", "28:16", "that's the stuff that's being thrown off", "28:18", "from the from the fight that's what", "28:20", "actually makes you feel sick and so when", "28:23", "you're activating certain thing parts of", "28:25", "the immune system and and they're thrown", "28:26", "off things can make you a little bit", "28:28", "tired some people very small percentage", "28:30", "have some flu-like symptoms for one day", "28:32", "but those are that's kind of like the", "28:35", "extent of the the side effects that we", "28:36", "typically see but if you if you look at", "28:39", "like", "28:40", "but yeah you asked why hasn't been being", "28:42", "done the us for for rheumatic drugs so", "28:46", "you put you see them on TV they're", "28:48", "advertised basically every hour of every", "28:51", "day on almost every station you sees and", "28:54", "rheumatics and you know if you have", "28:56", "rheumatoid arthritis if you have", "28:57", "psoriatic arthritis or this sort of", "28:59", "thing", "29:00", "these are biologics and these are", "29:01", "antibodies to a certain molecule called", "29:04", "TNF TNF one of the commanders of the", "29:06", "immune system it kind of says hey let's", "29:09", "let's cause a bunch of inflammation and", "29:10", "make you miserable and so the the these", "29:13", "drugs basically bind up or stop up the", "29:17", "TNF that's in your body for a period of", "29:19", "time that's why you have to get", "29:20", "retreated like every month every six", "29:21", "months every two months something like", "29:23", "that six weeks to two months and you", "29:26", "have to get retreat and retreated", "29:28", "there's a study of rheumatoid arthritis", "29:30", "where they it was 172 people that were", "29:33", "already on on medication for rheumatoid", "29:35", "arthritis not adequately controlled they", "29:38", "gave them like the equivalent of what a", "29:40", "typical dose we give in Panama is like", "29:42", "roughly 120 million cells and all of", "29:45", "them got better", "29:46", "all of them symptomatically improved and", "29:47", "and the cool thing was that that TNF", "29:51", "alpha and another molecule similar", "29:53", "similar to it decreased by 50% and that", "29:56", "decrease persisted for eight and a half", "29:58", "months that was the length of the study", "29:59", "so rather than putting an antibody in", "30:03", "two to top up what's being produced", "30:06", "apparently by your immune system you the", "30:10", "cells tell your immune system to stop it", "30:13", "right the cells they up regulate a", "30:15", "certain immune cell called T regulatory", "30:17", "cell that says to the immune system hey", "30:19", "quit making TNF alpha quit making this", "30:22", "il-6 stuff and they took 30 patients of", "30:25", "the sub-cohort like three months later", "30:27", "and gave them another shot the same dose", "30:29", "and it dropped their levels another 50%", "30:33", "from that baseline so from from baseline", "30:35", "to post second treatment two treatments", "30:38", "two IVs and in the chair dropped their", "30:41", "levels 75% it just seems like something", "30:44", "that would be amazing for overall repair", "30:46", "like just go down there and let your", "30:48", "body just get a little dose of healing", "30:51", "to figure out what the fuck is wrong", "30:52", "with it", "30:53", "well I'll talk about like we talked", "30:56", "about something in Costa Rica we were", "30:58", "both there and I had a you know they", "31:02", "looked at my neck I had a 50% occlusion", "31:04", "in the right carotid", "31:05", "you know like buildup of stuff like like", "31:08", "you don't feel it happening all of a", "31:10", "sudden you know all of a sudden when", "31:12", "your carotid to shut down they think", "31:13", "well you have to eat the statins right", "31:15", "yeah", "31:16", "like Chris Tora lipitor you know I", "31:19", "looked at what the side effects of those", "31:20", "things are terrible yeah and I said I'd", "31:22", "rather die than eat those things and", "31:24", "they said well you and they try make you", "31:26", "feel guilty for not doing you got kids", "31:28", "you got you know like yeah but it's uh I", "31:32", "don't have that stuff now and I didn't", "31:36", "get anyone to go in and remove it and I", "31:39", "don't know if I can attribute that to", "31:40", "the cells but I got a bunch of cells", "31:42", "like twice and that went away now I talk", "31:47", "about that for a minute does that sort", "31:49", "of yeah well just in general your your", "31:53", "body that you have a certain number of", "31:55", "these cells when you're born and they", "31:57", "they age just like the rest of your body", "31:59", "and they they they perform more poorly", "32:04", "as you age right so if you take one of", "32:06", "these cells from a newborn like when you", "32:08", "were born you could pluck one of these", "32:09", "cells out throw it in a petri dish and", "32:11", "let it grow you let it grow for a month", "32:13", "it divides roughly every 24 hours or", "32:16", "that's the doubling rate so at the end", "32:18", "of a month you have a billion cells and", "32:20", "then at at if you take from a 35 year", "32:24", "old and do the same thing doubling times", "32:26", "like two days instead of one day and you", "32:28", "at the end of a month you have 32,000", "32:30", "cells and you take them from a 65 year", "32:32", "old who's relatively healthy and they", "32:35", "divide every 60 hours if you get 200", "32:37", "cells at the end of the month so if your", "32:39", "problem is a thousand cells or it's", "32:41", "twenty thousand cells or if it's a", "32:43", "million cells you can't get it done past", "32:46", "a certain age just because it cells", "32:47", "don't have the regenerative capacity and", "32:49", "the good thing about the umbilical cord", "32:51", "cells is they if you co-culture them", "32:53", "with these older people's cells with the", "32:56", "young cells they don't have to touch", "32:58", "each other just the secretions of the", "32:59", "young cells will make the young the old", "33:01", "cells start dividing faster and behaving", "33:04", "younger and the mitochondria", "33:07", "in my book you can see a picture of of", "33:09", "cells from a 65 year old diabetic and", "33:13", "without any with without any juice on", "33:16", "them and then you put the juice from the", "33:18", "young cells on there and they look like", "33:20", "18 year old MS CS with with the", "33:23", "functional might of mitochondria all", "33:24", "throughout the cell body rather than all", "33:26", "bunched up they have they look help they", "33:28", "just I mean as a cell biologist I know", "33:30", "what looks healthy and anybody else", "33:32", "would you can see just from the picture", "33:34", "how vastly different it is just to be", "33:37", "exposed to the to the juice you know you", "33:40", "heard of this para bio so study they did", "33:42", "at Harvard where they took young life", "33:44", "and and their young mice and they and", "33:47", "they sewed them together with old mice", "33:48", "and then the old mice actually got", "33:50", "younger and and that mean they'd use the", "33:53", "blood of the young mice and put it in", "33:55", "the old mice well they literally showed", "33:57", "them together so their bodies together", "33:59", "so their bodies together and so their", "34:00", "blood streams together oh gee so that", "34:02", "the blood stream is mixing and so that", "34:05", "you the young that's some Frankenstein", "34:06", "Shay yeah that's pretty Frankie but they", "34:09", "so at the end at the end of the study", "34:11", "they showed that that that the older

be dead your modules go see", "42:22", "these guys over the stem cell place and", "42:23", "see if anything can happen and I think", "42:25", "his cases in the book as well but he", "42:27", "went from 11 to 42 or something like", "42:30", "that that he wasn't the first case the", "42:32", "first case was a doctor who's a friend", "42:35", "of Georgie's friend doctor pause or", "42:37",

it so he", "43:24", "did redid it a month later it was 55", "43:26", "percent so you know it's not I don't", "43:30", "think it's for every case we have people", "43:32", "with like a super bad heart

years you're", "43:42", "probably to see standard of care for", "43:45", "diseases chronic diseases like any", "43:48", "chronic degenerative disease for which", "43:51", "there's no good treatment

to", "44:26", "do in this country where you know we're", "44:28", "an advanced country I mean they should", "44:29", "look a little harder at it and it's a", "44:32", "mystery to me why it isn't the case but", "44:34", "you know hey if there are places where", "44:36", "one can go and get some help it's good I", "44:39", "mean I know another a gal she's a good", "44:41", "friend of mine she tore her shoulders up", "44:43", "because she was like an athlete and she", "44:46", "had her shoulders down and she got some", "44:48", "dropped into her and that actually", "44:51", "helped greatly with an autoimmune", "44:53", "disorder that she had and then she was", "44:56", "able to have kids it was that kind of", "44:59", "thing", "44:59", "you know yeah there's some really good", "45:02",

"45:22", "be true this is almost like skeptical", "45:24", "people that are listen to this right now", "45:25", "probably this fucking shit everything", "45:28", "yeah it sounds like the old spruiker on", "45:30", "the corner good for moles holes and", "45:33", "pimples on big ones but you've got", "45:35", "studies you mean you've got real trials", "45:37", "to back this up and you've got a host of", "45:39", "patients that have healed up and and and", "45:41", "healthy yeah yeah shut up well if you", "45:48", "see a 92 year old man who's about ready", "45:50", "to kick the bucket and he's almost a", "45:52", "hundred he's gonna celebrate 100 years", "45:54", "in August so and it's incredible he's", "45:57", "better off than he was let me tell you", "45:59", "yeah this young guy with the Duchenne's", "46:02", "muscular dystrophy you know this the", "46:03", "cells don't last forever this is also an", "46:05", "important point with the Shen's it's a", "46:08", "it's a it's a

we a few of us", "46:56", "got together and wrote an article when", "46:58", "they finally put the clamp on the last", "47:00", "embryonic stem-cell treatment and we've", "47:02", "been saying for years that embryonic", "47:04", "stem cells aren't gonna work because", "47:05", "they want to become babies their", "47:07", "number-one problem is they want to", "47:08", "become babies they don't

need to have", "51:34", "some sort of a consultation with a local", "51:36", "doctor an MRI or anything like that", "51:38", "before they go to see you oh yeah they", "51:39", "need to have a diagnosis from physician", "51:42", "for what they have and then you know", "51:43", "that we have a team of doctors there and", "51:45", "they'll talk to them and see what they", "51:46", "need if they need any other information", "51:48", "any other you know x-rays or MRIs or", "51:51", "whatever they'll sort all that out this", "51:54", "is all fascinating stuff man", "51:55", "and I never thought about going to", "51:56", "Panama until about an hour ago now I'm", "51:59", "thinking of taking a trip six hours it's", "52:03", "worth it yeah I just want to feel the", "52:05", "intravenous stuff I want to feel what", "52:07", "bas Rutten was talking about the", "52:08", "lightning bolts coming off my finger", "52:10", "he's a little dramatic yeah he's", "52:13", "definitely dramatic I wouldn't say that", "52:14", "to his face with a smile only but yes", "52:20", "when you treated him he was going", "52:22", "through some pretty significant issues", "52:24", "with his neck yeah yeah what benefits", "52:27", "did he find off of that well you know I", "52:29", "don't think for his neck it structurally", "52:32", "we weren't able to get the cells there", "52:33", "and I don't know if there's enough left", "52:35", "you know it's a lot of people there's", "52:41", "nothing if there's nothing structurally", "52:43", "to you know to do anything but thought", "52:45", "people talk about you know hair loss and", "52:47", "these cells work for hair loss and yeah", "52:49", "they do pretty good job but you can't", "52:51", "grow you can't grow grass on concrete", "52:53", "you know right and you can't you can't", "52:55", "stimulate a nerve to regrow that's a", "52:56", "there's no but not even a thread left", "52:58", "well he didn't get I don't believe you", "53:00", "got any benefit from his as accident", "53:02", "problem but he you know the", "53:06", "metabolic benefits were fantastic for", "53:08", "him and and energy wise and things like", "53:10", "that", "53:10", "yeah his one of one of his issues is", "53:13", "that he has some atrophy on one of his", "53:14", "arms because his nerves and his neck", "53:17", "were being pinched and for a long time", "53:19", "and he didn't address it quick enough", "53:20", "and it got to the point where his armor", "53:23", "shrinking right yeah and that's one of", "53:25", "the reasons why I went down there did", "53:26", "the experience any benefit from that I", "53:27", "don't believe he did no no that's a", "53:29", "tough one right regeneration of nerve", "53:31", "well especially really long time out you", "53:33", "know for like for spinal cord injury we", "53:37", "did a we did a cohort analysis and and", "53:39", "basically if if they're within one year", "53:42", "of injury a hundred percent of a hundred", "53:44", "percent of the patients had restoration", "53:48", "of some neurologic function it was", "53:50", "between one and two years is 82 percent", "53:52", "it was after two years it was fifty", "53:54", "percent so the longer it is and also the", "53:57", "older you are the less month you have", "53:59", "left you know the reason these cells", "54:01", "work for spinal cord injuries they don't", "54:03", "become spine they don't become nerves or", "54:05", "anything like that but the spinal cord", "54:08", "is one of the most replete areas of the", "54:11", "body when it comes to blood vessels", "54:13", "there's just barely enough blood vessels", "54:15", "to keep it alive and your liver on the", "54:17", "other hand has just tons of blood", "54:19", "vessels in it and your liver you know", "54:21", "you cut 80% of your liver out and it'll", "54:22", "regrow itself with your spinal cord you", "54:25", "just kind of ding a little bit and it", "54:26", "won't repair itself that's because there", "54:27", "are no blood vessels and therefore there", "54:30", "are no MSC are very few MSC's it's like", "54:33", "150th the number of MSC's reside in your", "54:35", "spinal cord because we built this", "54:37", "wonderful cage around it to protect it", "54:38", "and so all we're doing is we we shoot", "54:42", "the cells in there we also give them IV", "54:44", "and the cells secrete the things that", "54:46", "are necessary for this for the spinal", "54:48", "cord to regenerate itself but the longer", "54:50", "it is from imagery the more scarring", "54:52", "there is and all that sort of thing the", "54:55", "less benefit you're going to see so do", "54:58", "you anticipate a time where they'll be", "54:59", "able to regenerate spinal tissue or", "55:02", "someone has got a spinal cord injury", "55:04", "where they have partial or some sort of", "55:06", "paralysis when they can be able to", "55:08", "regenerate that I do and we have many", "55:11", "cases that it's already happened really", "55:13", "yeah like what cases well you know Juan", "55:16", "Carlos Maria is a commercial pilot from", "55:19", "Costa Rica and he was one day flying as", "55:21", "a National Geographic photographer", "55:24", "around and in his private plane and a", "55:26", "pancake and both of them got spinal cord", "55:28", "injuries JC you say pancake you mean", "55:30", "crashed crash a plane yeah yeah they", "55:33", "were up on a volcano and there's like", "55:34", "some crazy winds and stuff and it just", "55:36", "it just dropped out of the sky and", "55:38", "landed on the ground and and he had he", "55:42", "had no no function and no no sensation", "55:47", "below the injury basically from his", "55:49", "belly button down had no erectile", "55:51", "function no bowel function bladder", "55:52", "function any of that stuff and you know", "55:54", "the first time we treated him and how", "55:57", "are you treating him we're giving him IV", "55:59", "cells and intrathecal so into the spinal", "56:02", "fluid so the first the first round of", "56:04", "treatments after that his his biggest is", "56:08", "he had he described as like a 10 out of", "56:11", "a 10 pain scale so he had this", "56:14", "neuropathic pain that was just like he", "56:16", "was shoveling down narcotics like", "56:18", "nobody's business and he after the first", "56:20", "treatment he didn't get any restoration", "56:22", "of the function or anything but his pain", "56:24", "dropped from a 10 to a 3 and so he got", "56:26", "off to narcotics then the second time we", "56:29", "treated him he got his left leg back and", "56:32", "he could move it okay we started", "56:36", "treating him six months and three days", "56:38", "after his accident and then so he got", "56:40", "the the first round of treatments was in", "56:42", "you know the first month and it was", "56:44", "about three months later we did the", "56:45", "second round three months later he got", "56:47", "his right leg back and then three months", "56:49", "later it was over about a year at", "56:51", "fifteen month period probably in total", "56:53", "he basically got everything back you got", "56:55", "erectile function he got bowel bladder", "56:57", "all that sort of thing and you know I", "56:59", "just I just had dinner with him the", "57:00", "other night in Costa Rica and he can", "57:02", "walk in here and he got his commercial", "57:04", "pilot's license back and you know he", "57:06", "started a new business and you know he", "57:07", "has 100% he's I wouldn't say a hard", "57:11", "percent because he does have a bit of a", "57:14", "limp but he broke his leg when he was", "57:15", "four wheeling so before after the", "57:24", "accident he broke boy know so yeah so he", "57:28", "got all better and then he was perfectly", "57:30", "fine and then he", "57:31", "in four-wheeling and breaks his leg so", "57:34", "yeah so he was a hundred percent then he", "57:37", "fucked himself up again yeah so he lips", "57:39", "a little bit but but most people don't", "57:41", "know that he ever had a spinal cord", "57:42", "injury you know that's incredible", "57:44", "so you feel like with conventional", "57:46", "treatment that guy would still be in a", "57:47", "wheelchair", "57:47", "yeah absolutely yeah I mean he was that", "57:50", "he made zero progress so that we're", "57:52", "designing this study at mine that we're", "57:54", "doing at Miami that's being funded by", "57:56", "the Marcos people there are two newer", "57:59", "neurosurgeons that are on that so we", "58:01", "wanted to okay we're discussing what at", "58:05", "what at what time point should we accept", "58:07", "him and these these very prominent", "58:10", "neurosurgeons said let's do six months", "58:12", "because that's six months you got 98 to", "58:14", "99 percent back everything you're gonna", "58:16", "have so let's do patients their subjects", "58:18", "better from six months to two years and", "58:20", "so that's the those are the inclusion", "58:22", "criteria that's a timing that we're", "58:23", "going to do for this study at Miami this", "58:26", "is phenomenal so is that study published", "58:28", "online is there anything we're or this", "58:29", "case rather published on that case is", "58:31", "post online yeah absolutely it's", "58:32", "referencing my book it's its own you", "58:34", "have to it's yeah what's reference in", "58:36", "both books but in the spinal cord", "58:39", "chapter so stem cell therapy rising tide", "58:42", "is the one that it's written for the", "58:44", "layperson there you go that that it so", "58:49", "it's referenced in there and the whole", "58:51", "story about Juan Carlos and his you know", "58:53", "his journey and you know how he got", "58:55", "started and everything's in there as", "58:56", "well as a reference to the published", "58:58", "article that's in a scientific journal", "59:00", "about this case and then MSC is the one", "59:03", "that you read if you want to go to sleep", "59:04", "or if you're a super nerd exactly", "59:06", "exactly and sell medicine dot-com that's", "59:09", "the that's the website yep CEO Melissa", "59:13", "man this is fantastic stuff and I mean", "59:15", "I'm very intrigued and I really I hope", "59:19", "people that have issues can reach out to", "59:21", "you and and try to see if you can get", "59:23", "some treatment and if I would love to", "59:24", "hear back from them I mean what

nearly", "59:32", "as potent as the stuff that you're using", "59:34", "down there and I've had some pretty", "59:35", "dramatic results yeah so it's incredible", "59:38", "stuff cool TJ Dillashaw says hi oh you", "59:41", "know TJ yeah he came down there and", "59:44", "yeah it came down there like three", "59:46", "months before the last fight and he got", "59:47", "his belt back and he's
