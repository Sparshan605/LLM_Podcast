you know people", "04:51", "say like oh I didn't know that or tell", "04:53", "me more about this or this was", "04:55", "interesting that's great like by all", "04:57", "means do it but if you're

the just flat text you don't", "05:56", "know anything about the background the", "05:58", "person is sending it and there's a style", "06:01", "of doing that that's designed to kind of", "06:04",

intellectual life", "06:34", "right like I'm not sometimes I'll be", "06:35", "talking about science sometimes I won't", "06:36", "like we tend to silo off science as a", "06:39", "thing and then like a kind of economics", "06:42", "in history in political science is", "06:43", "another thing that is out there and", "06:45", "relevant to the world and science is", "06:46", "something that is sort of a form of", "06:47", "entertainment for a lot of people and I", "06:49", "want to mix it all up I want like the", "06:50", "different people talking to each other", "06:51", "and so overall by all

"07:25", "rational discourse where everyone is", "07:27", "talking about ideas in a dispassionate", "07:29", "way and in good faith looking toward", "07:31", "moving toward the truth it would be nice", "07:34", "if we had like a system like almost like", "07:37", "a rating system of for humans like a", "07:40", "Yelp for commentators that people are", "07:43", "trying that it's not a bad idea it", "07:45", "really isn't in terms of like like", "07:47", "people review your comments on things", "07:49", "and enough people decide like like this", "07:52", "is just unnecessary help for expertise", "07:54", "or for commentary and gently well all", "07:57", "the above yeah I mean I think that's", "08:00", "probably going to move to some sort of a", "08:01", "system like that in fact some people are", "08:03", "actually advocating that in for society", "08:07", "to have some sort of or like a rating", "08:10", "system for people and almost a new kind", "08:15", "of currency like a social currency", "08:17", "they're doing in China right yes yes yes", "08:20", "it's scary for people though because", "08:22", "it's China and you know and China is", "08:25", "it's a trippy place and it's very trippy", "08:28", "in terms of it's sort of got capitalism", "08:31", "going but it's also a communist", "08:33", "dictatorship and government and the all", "08:37", "the companies are

that China has been so", "09:25", "stable and successful because there are", "09:27", "you know people who don't like it there", "09:29", "are people who rebel against the system", "09:30", "but even

you been", "10:35", "paying attention yeah that's tough yeah", "10:37", "that is that is a stunning revelation", "10:40", "that there's 24/7 businesses where", "10:43", "people are set up where they're hired to", "10:46", "just tweet and post things and comment", "10:50", "on things and they're all working in", "10:53", "some way to try to manipulate wait", "10:57", "the way people look at the news yeah and", "10:59", "the most interesting thing to me I", "11:00", "thought like if they were clever they", "11:01", "will do this and they do it it's not", "11:03", "just that they have a

ways to scapegoat", "14:08", "people who don't deserve it one of the", "14:10", "things it's fascinating to me that seems", "14:12", "to be boiling under the surface is the", "14:14", "possibility that we might need some sort", "14:17", "of universal basic income to deal with", "14:19", "what's happening with AI and automate", "14:22", "automate ation like auto automation of", "14:27", "cars

me it's just it's one of", "14:45", "those little sneaky things it might just", "14:46", "catch us before we're ready for it yeah", "14:48", "I think that if you you know extrapolate", "14:51", "very

what they want to", "15:08", "do if you believe that that's a possible", "15:11", "future then the way to get there is to", "15:13", "as robots and machines do more and more", "15:15", "make it more and more possible for", "15:17", "people to live without working I think", "15:19", "that's at least I have no idea whether", "15:21", "works in practice I'm not an economist I", "15:23", "haven't studied it but", "15:24", "I think it should be taken seriously as", "15:26", "an idea if you looked at it as a", "15:28", "pessimist", "15:29", "if you looked at it with a cynical", "15:30", "perspective you'd say uh well people", "15:32", "just what they don't have motivation", "15:34", "then they behave like rich kids or", "15:36", "entitled people or people who won the", "15:38",

but the real problem I think", "16:04", "would be growing up with that I think if", "16:07", "you you got it as an adult you'd", "16:10", "probably recognize it as a safety net", "16:12", "that it is but as it was during your", "16:15", "developmental process you might rely on", "16:17", "it as a constant yeah and so that might", "16:20", "be a problem in terms of motivation I", "16:23", "think so and I think that uh and you see", "16:25", "it right I mean I have friends at", "16:26", "various levels of income and class that", "16:29", "they grew up in and you can always tell", "16:30", "people who grew up in very comfortable", "16:33", "environments because they don't have", "16:34", "jobs they have projects done a project", "16:38", "because they're not really worried about", "16:39", "the project failing you know like the if", "16:41", "you grew up without that safety net", "16:44", "you're more cautious yeah like you have", "16:46", "to have a fail-safe you have to have a", "16:48", "back-up plan and but what if everyone", "16:51", "had that back-up plan what if we could", "16:52", "all do projects instead of work is that", "16:54", "really a worse world you know any trust",

weird yeah it's possible find", "17:14", "those people and clone them yeah find", "17:16", "out what made them pick what was there", "17:18", "so they found a passion they found", "17:20", "something that they're actually that", "17:21", "seems to be a giant issue that's right", "17:23", "and your parents need to you know sort", "17:25", "of encourage that you know you parents", "17:29", "matter when it comes to like if you're", "17:31", "if you are very wealthy do you feel like", "17:33", "you deserve it or do you feel like I", "17:35", "should you know give something back", "17:36", "because I'm really really", "17:38", "right well there's cockamamie ideas that", "17:40", "come from people that haven't earned", "17:41", "their money - like one guy came to me", "17:43", "with this crazy idea for this project", "17:44", "he's doing and wanted me to get involved", "17:46", "in it and I was I was going over the", "17:48", "details of it I was like I don't think", "17:49", "this is gonna work like why why is this", "17:51", "guy so enthusiastic about it and then", "17:53", "the more I dug into him like oh he got", "17:55", "all this money from his dad like oh well", "17:59",

"18:08", "wealthy because I didn't but because I", "18:09", "now have a job that represents what I", "18:12", "want to do like what I would do with my", "18:14", "life", "18:15", "if I were independently wealthy isn't", "18:18", "that different from what I'm doing right", "18:20", "now right that's yes exactly but", "18:22", "therefore I kind of think that I would", "18:24", "like a world where everyone can do that", "18:26", "if that's what they wanted that would be", "18:27", "amazing", "18:28", "yeah the real question is does everybody", "18:31", "have an actual interest and

I", "19:33", "don't know yeah well there's so many", "19:35", "styles of living - you know when you're", "19:37", "talking about China I was in China", "19:39", "recently I was we spent some time in", "19:42", "Thailand and we flew through China and", "19:44", "one of the things he realized about", "19:45", "China is they just say there's a", "19:47", "different totally different way of move", "19:49", "like people just walk right through", "19:52", "people yeah I mean they their lines if", "19:56", "there's a space and a line that like", "19:58", "peanut they don't respect that space", "19:59", "they go right into that space right in", "20:01", "front of you like oh there's a space", "20:02", "there yeah they didn't even think of it", "20:03", "as rude it's not the style right yeah", "20:05", "yeah it's just no no no we went through", "20:08", "Southeast Asia for a few weeks and you", "20:10", "know visited Vietnam and Thailand and", "20:11", "they're right next to each other but", "20:13", "just the behavior in the cities utterly", "20:14", "different like just walking down the", "20:16", "street it's just a different culture I", "20:17", "haven't been to Vietnam", "20:18", "what was I'll be none was my favorite it", "20:20", "was realized yeah everybody says that", "20:21", "it's great I mean I don't know I was", "20:23", "there for a few days right I'm sure that", "20:25", "there's depths to the country that I", "20:26", "didn't perceive but you know I was", "20:29", "coming to life literally the week we", "20:30", "were there was the first McDonald's was", "20:32", "opening in Vietnam so which is not good", "20:35", "but at least it meant it was we were", "20:37", "there in a pre McDonald's Society right", "20:39", "and though it was physically very", "20:42", "beautiful the food was amazing it was", "20:44", "all scatter shot like that you know", "20:45", "people just go crazy on the streets in", "20:47", "any direction they want and it was not", "20:48", "organized or anything like that but it", "20:50", "was very genuine you know it was people", "20:52", "were trying you know to be nice people", "20:55", "it seemed to be very friendly like that", "20:57", "we didn't speak any of the language or", "20:58", "anything like that and it was just a", "21:01", "wonderful experience overall yeah that's", "21:03", "awesome", "21:04", "yeah it's Asia's trip it's a really", "21:07", "different part of the world China is", "21:09", "yeah I've been to China too and it's", "21:10", "it's a that's a trip for a different", "21:11", "reason right and you know I I'm scared", "21:14", "by China in the sense that I I'm worried", "21:17", "that they will succeed while still being", "21:19", "repressive dictatorship right like I", "21:22", "remember reading you know this these", "21:24", "memoirs from Bertrand Russell when he", "21:26", "visited China and he was rhapsodizing", "21:29", "about this is an amazing culture amazing", "21:31", "people this is great and I'm like does", "21:33", "he not know it's a communist", "21:34", "dictatorship and then my brain kicked in", "21:35", "I'm like oh no is 1912 it was not a", "21:37", "communist dictatorship at the time in", "21:39", "the there's a great tragedy in the way", "21:42", "that China has been sort of repressed", "21:44", "for so long I think there's immense", "21:47", "potential and promise there but it's", "21:49", "also the possibility that they just", "21:51", "remain and this autocracy forever and", "21:54", "some people's lives improve and a lot of", "21:56", "people is just drudgery for billions of", "21:57", "people yeah it's totally possible it's", "22:00", "it's fascinating that they become this", "22:01", "combination of things", "22:03", "combination of both capitalism and", "22:04", "communism yeah well I think that's it", "22:06", "they found a release valve like he", "22:08", "couldn't you couldn't be the Soviet", "22:09", "Union was gonna collapse because it was", "22:11", "it's a terrible system right then", "22:12", "economically politically whatever and", "22:14", "China found this little bit of balance", "22:16", "where they still have the repressive", "22:18", "dictatorship but they give enough", "22:19", "freedom for people to you know be", "22:22", "ambitious and try to get ahead and and", "22:24", "that improves the economy and they make", "22:27", "some terrible mistakes right there are", "22:28", "these huge cities that are built no one", "22:29", "lives there", "22:30", "right these spooky pictures right you've", "22:33", "seen the recreations of other large", "22:35", "cities like Paris I've seen that and", "22:38", "sometimes like cities like Shenzhen like", "22:40", "right next to Hong Kong there's the city", "22:42", "five million people the thirty years ago", "22:44", "was fifty thousand people right like it", "22:46", "just they built it yeah in a couple", "22:48", "years and in other places like oh well", "22:51", "build a shopping mall here where there's", "22:52", "and it's just instantly it looks like", "22:54", "Detroit the next day there's no one", "22:55", "there and you know no one makes no one", "22:59", "builds anything no one does anything", "23:00", "with it because it's it's not really", "23:01", "capitalism it's still a planned economy", "23:04", "and there's pluses a minus or that no", "23:06", "doubt one of the big fears about China", "23:08", "is their experimentation with genetics", "23:11", "is that they're willing to do things", "23:14", "ethically that scientists in America and", "23:17", "a lot of parts of the Western world are", "23:19", "not willing to engage in yet yeah", "23:21", "including the use of CRISPR on human", "23:24", "embryos yep and I think so I have mixed", "23:27", "feelings about that I think it's gonna", "23:28", "happen in all cultures I think we're", "23:29", "gonna do it right I actually had sorry I", "23:32", "haven't released that podcast yet but", "23:34", "stay tuned I have an excellent podcast", "23:36", "coming with Carl Zimmer who is a science", "23:38", "writer just wrote a long book about", "23:39", "heredity in genetics and yeah so what", "23:43", "they're going to be doing with the", "23:45", "designer babies it's not science fiction", "23:47", "as far as I can tell it's gonna happen", "23:48", "and but it's very unclear what it will", "23:51", "mean because we're not any good right", "23:53", "now at figuring out how genetics turns", "23:55", "it how your DNA turns into a person", "23:57", "right yeah it might be like you know", "24:00", "that we find something other if you", "24:01", "increase if you change this particular", "24:03", "gene sure you can live twice as long but", "24:07", "also you'll have Parkinson's disease", "24:08", "when you're four right like we don't", "24:10", "know what the interdependencies are and", "24:11", "stuff like that", "24:13", "so but but it's coming like I think that", "24:15", "the idea that we will be choosing", "24:19", "embryos to come to term and be people on", "24:22", "the basis of their genes before they're", "24:25", "you know implanted in a uterus is a", "24:29", "hundred percent that's gonna happen and", "24:31", "the chance that we're gonna be editing", "24:33", "them is 99.99% chance and you're right", "24:36", "China is way more willing to do that and", "24:39", "again I'm not really sure that's good or", "24:41", "bad you know I think it's gonna come", "24:42", "here what I'm more worried about is that", "24:44", "you know people figure out a system that", "24:47", "will make you can have a baby who's", "24:50", "guaranteed to be you know tall and", "24:52", "beautiful and smart and live for a", "24:55", "hundred fifty years and it'll cost you a", "24:57", "million dollars then that'll be a little", "25:00", "bit unfair right that will be an issue", "25:02", "that will come up yeah but then isn't it", "25:05", "unfair that the rock is the rock how did", "25:08", "he get to be the rock it is but I think", "25:09", "just psychologically it's I think he", "25:12", "worked hard he started in the right", "25:17", "place you know the story of Yao Ming", "25:19", "right no because so yelling the", "25:21", "basketball player right I know he was", "25:23", "basically the result of a breeding", "25:25", "program really like they encouraged his", "25:27", "parents who were both really tall", "25:28", "basketball players to have a baby and", "25:30", "you know it worked for him it doesn't", "25:32", "always work as it's a crapshoot but yeah", "25:35", "it can work yeah and so but that's", "25:37", "normal breeding that's like a dog and my", "25:41", "dog is a good-looking dog of the same", "25:43", "breed let's put them together that's", "25:45", "right with human beings but yes", "25:46", "otherwise normal yes and it it I think", "25:51", "it's different it's different", "25:53", "psychologically because we think it's", "25:55", "different winning the lottery than", "25:57", "already being rich and therefore being", "26:00", "able to afford something that changes", "26:02", "who you are right right I think that I", "26:04", "don't know maybe I'm wrong maybe people", "26:06", "will think that that's awesome and will", "26:07", "these people all be you know celebrities", "26:09", "and we'll follow them on Instagram but I", "26:11", "suspect people be rubbed the wrong way", "26:13", "at that kind of access to something that", "26:16", "most people can't afford it most", "26:18", "certainly will they most certainly well", "26:20", "but I think if you look at it", "26:21", "objectively if you look at the", "26:23", "interactions of the species as", "26:25", "you know a completely outside observer", "26:28", "you would say not only is it's", "26:30", "inevitable but this is going to lead to", "26:32", "some really spectacular changes in what", "26:35", "a human being is like think about a big", "26:37", "part of what we're concerned with", "26:40", "constantly on a daily basis is", "26:41", "healthcare right people are very", "26:43", "concerned with people that have to deal", "26:45", "with debilitating diseases and if we", "26:47", "could just eliminate all those yeah why", "26:49", "wouldn't you want that yeah I think you", "26:51", "know and think you probably will be able", "26:53", "to and it will probably happen that I", "26:54", "think is yeah but then so ever almost", "26:57", "everyone agrees with that like that's", "26:58", "not the controversial part right like", "26:59", "yeah if we can eliminate and apparently", "27:01", "some diseases we already know like right", "27:04", "there in your DNA you're gonna get", "27:06", "Huntington's when you're 40 years old", "27:07", "right yes and so those are easy to", "27:09", "eliminate peanut allergies or something", "27:10", "like that other diseases are harder we", "27:13", "don't know what causes them so it'll", "27:14", "take time but I think that that would be", "27:16", "unconscious tree move diseases from", "27:18", "people ahead of time it's a little bit", "27:20", "different if you're choosing their hair", "27:22", "color and skin color and shape of their", "27:24", "nose and feet and whatever mm-hmm that", "27:26", "gets it does get squirrely but it's also", "27:30", "you know when the idea of it being a", "27:32", "cost prohibitive issue well isn't that", "27:37", "the case with almost all technology as", "27:39", "it emerges it's very experimental and", "27:41", "plasma TVs were like $20,000 for a small", "27:45", "television I remember I saw them it was", "27:48", "only like a 30-inch television or", "27:50", "something that was a exorbitant I was", "27:51", "like this is incredible it's flat but", "27:56", "you know everybody has them yeah and", "27:58", "they're cheap you can get one for a few", "27:59", "hundred bucks and it's way bigger and", "28:01", "way better than what it was back then", "28:02", "yeah and I think that actually that's", "28:03", "very realistic that maybe will be", "28:05", "million dollars but then 10 years later", "28:06", "will be hundred thousand passes to sort", "28:08", "of be a million dollars first right it", "28:10", "kind of just like cell phones like", "28:12", "everything else it has to be a really", "28:13", "expensive thing and then eventually it", "28:15", "trickles down like cell phones and", "28:18", "becomes available everywhere to", "28:19", "everybody like if you look at the", "28:20", "average person's cell phone if you buy a", "28:23", "cheap cell phone for like 300 bucks it", "28:26", "is way better than an iPhone from 10", "28:28", "years ago yeah you know it's just it's", "28:29", "just in every way ya know I think that's", "28:31", "probably right and I think that it's one", "28:35", "of the things that's happening like", "28:36", "we're still the beginning of technology", "28:38", "right like we're", "28:39", "technology's not that advanced compared", "28:41", "to where it's gonna be you know I have", "28:43", "another podcast guest coming up who is", "28:45", "an expert on aging and how we can fix", "28:48", "that", "28:48", "by messing with genes a little bit was", "28:50", "it Aubrey de Grey no no this was a real", "28:52", "scientist at Princeton you know someone", "28:55", "who's just doing a real scientist uh", "28:57", "well he's I don't know him that well so", "29:00", "I shouldn't say but I think it was an", "29:02", "advocate for anti aging yeah which is", "29:05", "good which is cool but the but my guest", "29:08", "Kelly Murphy's just like a biologist who", "29:10", "was working on things and discovered", "29:12", "something right she's not trying that", "29:14", "hard right you knock out a certain gene", "29:17", "in the certain worm and it lives twice", "29:19", "as long and without any decay right like", "29:21", "it doesn't get old because it's it's", "29:23", "fascinating like why do we die why do we", "29:26", "grow old it's not necessary like you", "29:28", "could design an organism that doesn't", "29:31", "get older it would die from random bad", "29:33", "things you get hit on the head with a", "29:34", "brick but you don't need to die the", "29:37", "reality is that evolution programmed", "29:40", "aging and death into us because once we", "29:42", "have kids or once we've outlived our", "29:44", "reproductive lifespan we're not useful", "29:45", "anymore", "29:46", "so biology is wants us to die and so", "29:49", "that that in other words it's", "29:50", "potentially fixable you know it might", "29:52", "not be easy might be not happen 200", "29:54", "years from now but it could so I think", "29:57", "that you know aging genetic engineering", "30:00", "brain computer interfaces you know all", "30:03", "that stuff is going to within the next", "30:05", "hundred years totally change what it", "30:06", "means to be a human being and we're", "30:07", "totally not ready for it and so I was", "30:10", "saying this to Carl he Carl's like not", "30:12", "that Carl Zimmer was is more or less", "30:14", "sanguine about it's like don't worry", "30:16", "just you know we'll put regulations on", "30:17", "it'll be fine and my attitude was no", "30:19", "actually we should think of the absolute", "30:21", "craziest science fiction scenarios", "30:23", "because I want to be prepared right yeah", "30:25", "it doesn't come to pass", "30:26", "I want to worry about the least probable", "30:28", "things because it might spark something", "30:31", "that actually helps us down the road", "30:32", "yeah there was a recent discovery", "30:34", "they've figured out a way to shut off", "30:36", "whatever it is that causes wrinkles and", "30:38", "reverse the process so whatever is", "30:41", "causing your skin to get wrinkly and sag", "30:43", "yeah they're reversing that process we", "30:45", "might be members of the last generation", "30:48", "to die whoa or of old age", "30:51", "we won't be immortal well then if you", "30:54", "thought you were immortal if you thought", "30:55", "let's say you thought that your average", "30:56", "lifespan was a million years would you", "30:58", "suddenly become way more cautious", "31:00", "I'd start jumping off buildings and shit", "31:02", "do like I have a friend of mine who does", "31:05", "that a flying squirrel suit stuff", "31:07", "he holds the world you don't become", "31:09", "invulnerable you just don't he yes", "31:11", "exactly flying school stuff is truly", "31:14", "dangerous oh it's super dangerous", "31:15", "yeah thanks jump what if they could just", "31:17", "fix you if you like even but that's a", "31:20", "separate thing yes that's possible right", "31:22", "like maybe they get back to your goo", "31:23", "back you up then you just dive when they", "31:26", "build your clone put you back together", "31:27", "like all these crazy science fiction's", "31:29", "here I don't think that that's I think", "31:30", "that backing up is way harder than", "31:32", "people think and I think that stopping", "31:34", "aging is way easier than people think", "31:36", "but we'll see I agree with you I went to", "31:40", "the 2045 I think they're calling it a", "31:43", "conference in New York City a few years", "31:45", "back ago it's all the Ray Kurzweil", "31:47", "advocates that think you're going to", "31:49", "download brains into computers and stuff", "31:51", "flowingly not that compelling yeah that", "31:54", "that stuff was like what are you gonna", "31:56", "do what's good what's gonna happen it", "31:58", "seems like everybody had this idea of", "32:00", "one day we'll be able to do this and", "32:02", "we'll be able to take consciousness and", "32:03", "I'm like yeah hmm I mean maybe doesn't", "32:07", "violate the laws of physics but it's", "32:08", "hopelessly impractical compared to", "32:10", "anything we can do right now like the", "32:11", "human brain it's just not something you", "32:12", "can read out my question and this was", "32:15", "was something really concerned me was", "32:17", "what's to keep someone from making", "32:19", "hundreds of thousands of versions of", "32:21", "themselves like what it's what to take", "32:23", "someone from some you know really rich", "32:26", "billionaire character that can afford to", "32:28", "do this and say I'm gonna do this many", "32:31", "many times then I'm gonna have my clones", "32:33", "make clones of clones and I'm gonna fill", "32:35", "up a whole island with me why would you", "32:38", "do that though cuz you're a crazy person", "32:40", "okay I mean crazy people are lovely", "32:41", "crazy things right letting you imagine", "32:43", "if you had a hundred Sean Carroll's into", "32:45", "your house working on things but it but", "32:47", "they're not the same person but if you", "32:49", "found out the thirty the Sean Carroll or", "32:50", "smoking crack have you realized that", "32:59", "like after a while there is a randomness", "33:04", "yeah sure yes evo-devo right yeah you", "33:07", "grow up in matters that would be really", "33:10", "fascinating if that would be an", "33:12", "excellent episode of black mirror yeah", "33:14", "where someone cloned themselves and", "33:15", "found out that a certain percentage of", "33:16", "their clones were just fucking crazy or", "33:18", "they were the crazy one right like all", "33:21", "the clones were very different than them", "33:23", "and they were all it seemed to each", "33:24", "other yeah or maybe having all those", "33:26", "clones somehow another set something off", "33:28", "and them that made them crazy because", "33:30", "they were in competition with all these", "33:31", "other people that were exactly like them", "33:33", "this is golden yeah we should edit this", "33:34", "out of the podcast so we can write up", "33:36", "this episode there's a real concern with", "33:39", "messing with biology in a way that's", "33:41", "never been done before exactly I think", "33:43", "that the extent to which it's coming is", "33:45", "something we haven't quite faced up to", "33:48", "right and it's really coming it's coming", "33:50", "fast and profoundly we're not ready yeah", "33:54", "and the possibility of just creating a", "33:58", "world that we're not prepared for and", "34:00", "we're not prepared for the consequences", "34:02", "of yeah exactly so that's why I'm all in", "34:04", "favor of thinking crazy right like just", "34:07", "wondering what it would be like even if", "34:09", "the answer is no that'll never happen", "34:11", "at least you know be prepared a little", "34:12", "bit you know think of all the alarmist", "34:14", "crazy scenarios yeah have you really", "34:18", "gotten into CRISPR have you really", "34:20", "looked into that stuff at all not that", "34:21", "much you know it's all too applied to", "34:24", "real-world for my taste but for people", "34:27", "don't know what we're talking about", "34:28", "we're talking it's a new technique for", "34:30", "editing jeans that was discovered", "34:33", "accidentally while examining the effects", "34:35", "of the story is amazing I mean they're", "34:38", "these bacteria you know so we here's a", "34:40", "thing we think of DNA as where our", "34:44", "genetic information is stored right like", "34:46", "you have a little code a little list of", "34:48", "symbols a CGT and they're in a row and", "34:52", "that's it is handed down from parents to", "34:55", "children but the reality is way more", "34:57", "complicated than that", "34:59", "because different parts of the DNA do", "35:01", "things and different ones don't some of", "35:03", "them get turned on turned off we have", "35:05", "mitochondrial DNA which are not our DNA", "35:08", "we have these little sub cells within us", "35:10", "that get carried along for the ride and", "35:11", "have their own DNA", "35:13", "and so crisper is this thing that was", "35:16", "invented by nature right not by human", "35:18", "beings these bacteria who were trying to", "35:22", "resist viruses right so the viruses", "35:25", "would come in and attack them and", "35:26", "basically the D the bacteria learned a", "35:29", "way to steal part of the DNA of the", "35:32", "virus and keep it as like a facial", "35:35", "recognition software thing it's like a", "35:37", "template like oh this DNA thing is", "35:40", "approaching me that's a virus and I", "35:41", "should attack it right like this is", "35:43", "something that I learned how to fight", "35:44", "off and so to do that I need to be able", "35:47", "to snip out a little piece of DNA and so", "35:50", "scientists biologists learned that they", "35:52", "could train this is a little bit", "35:54", "fanciful way putting it metaphorical but", "35:57", "they could train the bacteria to go in", "35:58", "there snip out pieces of DNA and you can", "36:01", "do that for any DNA you want so--but and", "36:03", "you can replace it with something else", "36:05", "it's not really very high precision", "36:08", "right now but that's coming and so in", "36:11", "principle this is you know a little way", "36:14", "to change a genetic code and then they", "36:17", "figured out some other way that", "36:19", "ordinarily right if you have two parents", "36:22", "and you have like you know brown eyes", "36:25", "versus blue eyes and blue eyes are", "36:27", "recessive so they both need to have the", "36:28", "blue-eyed gene to give you if you want", "36:30", "to have blue eyes but they figured out a", "36:32", "way that you can change the DNA and it", "36:34", "automatically with 100% accuracy gets", "36:36", "sent to all of your offspring right it's", "36:38", "not you know 50-50 chance or whatever so", "36:41", "then you can just propagate a change in", "36:43", "the genetic code throughout the species", "36:45", "pretty darn quickly", "36:46", "I know human beings take a long time to", "36:48", "breed but animals and plants it's a", "36:50", "whole nother world right you can design", "36:51", "those very very rapidly and there's", "36:53", "already been at least one revision of", "36:55", "the process right I think so but yeah I", "36:58", "think I just told you everything I think", "37:00", "they're they're continuing to improve on", "37:03", "the process and it's really it's really", "37:05", "going to be very interesting to see", "37:07", "where that goes as that advances yeah I", "37:10", "think this was a concern with P places", "37:12", "like China right they're already doing", "37:14", "this they're already manipulating", "37:16", "genetics and trying to create super", "37:18", "people and I think the chances that", "37:20", "gives them a great basketball team or", "37:22", "greater than the chances that you have a", "37:23", "bunch of brilliant PhD scientists well", "37:25", "that's where that starts right in", "37:27", "it starts in competitive athletics have", "37:28", "you paid attention did you watch the", "37:30", "documentary Icarus no I did not", "37:32", "yeah fascinating documentary that's on", "37:34", "Netflix right now about its it really is", "37:37", "a kind of a crazy set of circumstances", "37:39", "there's a guy named Brian Fogle he's the", "37:41", "director of in the producer of the movie", "37:43", "and he was competitive bike racer and he", "37:47", "decided to document what he wanted to do", "37:49", "was compete in a race a bike race a", "37:52", "hundred percent clean and then get a", "37:55", "Russian scientist to juice him up so in", "37:58", "the process of getting this Russian", "38:00", "scientist to juice him up he stumbled", "38:03", "upon a scandal and in the middle of him", "38:06", "making shocked yeah but I mean in a", "38:09", "crazy way because his Russian guy is the", "38:10", "head of the anti-doping agency in Russia", "38:13", "and he was just sort of informing him", "38:15", "how you would do this so he teaches him", "38:18", "and forms him how you can do this while", "38:19", "this is all going on it turns out that", "38:22", "the Russians had completely cheated", "38:25", "their way through the Sochi Olympics now", "38:28", "and it was all documented and so they", "38:30", "were getting busted as this is all going", "38:32", "on and he films this Russian guy was the", "38:35", "head of it escaping Russia barely coming", "38:38", "to the United States and being chased", "38:40", "and testifying all the different", "38:43", "strategies that the Russians used in", "38:45", "order to completely cheat on like at", "38:48", "least one entire Olympic team like every", "38:52", "single athlete was on drugs", "38:53", "yeah and they had a record number of", "38:55", "gold medals and so then he starts", "38:58", "detailing the process and how they did", "39:00", "it in these forensic tests examined them", "39:03", "with urine bottles and showed that", "39:05", "they've been open even though they were", "39:06", "supposedly not open a bowl and really", "39:09", "really interesting stuff but that", "39:11", "national pride", "39:13", "the thing about national pride and you", "39:16", "know the ability to win a bunch of gold", "39:18", "medals and athletic dominance is so", "39:21", "important for the morale of these", "39:24", "countries that want to establish the", "39:26", "periodic right yeah and there are some", "39:28", "people who say well let's just go for it", "39:30", "let's just have the old dope Olympics", "39:33", "right like let people enhance themselves", "39:34", "as much as they possibly can and there's", "39:37", "an ongoing you know debate about what", "39:39", "about people who use", "39:40", "aesthetics right is that fair if you", "39:43", "lost a leg and you have a prosthetic leg", "39:45", "is could that potentially give you an", "39:47", "advantage in a running event or", "39:49", "something like that if there is", "39:50", "efficiently good prosthetic eye I don't", "39:52", "know the answer any of these questions I", "39:54", "think it's a little bit weird because we", "39:56", "set up these arbitrary categories for", "39:58", "what is it a sporting event we invented", "40:00", "them right they're not out there in the", "40:01", "world and now we're we're faced with", "40:03", "wholly different circumstances to what", "40:05", "to do about it but yeah I think that you", "40:07", "know there's there's the question what", "40:09", "we should do which is hard there's the", "40:11", "question of what's gonna happen which is", "40:12", "it's all gonna happen you know all of", "40:14", "these things are gonna happen I was", "40:16", "talking to a guy this past weekend who's", "40:17", "a Navy SEAL and his friend lost his hand", "40:19", "and they gave him a new hand and they're", "40:23", "working on this new hand now that's", "40:25", "gonna allow him to play piano so it's a", "40:29", "completely artificial carbon-fiber hand", "40:31", "with all these different things that", "40:33", "attach directly to your nerves and", "40:35", "somehow or another he can control it", "40:37", "with his arm it's gonna allow him to", "40:39", "play piano and you're gonna tell me he", "40:41", "could never play the piano before its", "40:44", "program it's in that it's in the thing", "40:46", "it's yeah well this is what I was saying", "40:48", "about the brain computer interfaces I", "40:49", "think that's the the real that's even", "40:51", "bigger frontier than synthetic biology", "40:55", "or genetic engineering because computers", "40:57", "are really useful for things robots are", "40:59", "very useful for things yeah human beings", "41:01", "are just gonna sort of blend in it's not", "41:03", "like we're in AI and super healthy", "41:04", "humans it's we're gonna just have", "41:06", "everywhere on that spectrum yeah that's", "41:09", "what I'm thinking as well there's gonna", "41:10", "be some sort of a symbiotic thing like a", "41:12", "chip or you know they tried it with the", "41:14", "Google glasses to try to get people to", "41:16", "wear that but they were goofy I put them", "41:18", "on they felt to science fictiony just", "41:21", "like the first portable phones were", "41:22", "these giant things that doesn't that's", "41:24", "not a long term for classification tool", "41:26", "yeah lots of lots of people are working", "41:30", "on it Elon Musk has a little company", "41:32", "that no one knows about that what they", "41:34", "do now yeah well people know about if", "41:36", "they care but it's not like one of his", "41:37", "famous ones right right to implant", "41:41", "neural lace write something in your body", "41:44", "that reads your brain neuro lace I don't", "41:46", "like the way that sounds", "41:47", "where's it go you win a more macho I", "41:49", "wanted the back of your head too", "41:55", "I was thinking of it as like a mesh yeah", "41:58", "yeah that's what that's it just seems", "41:59", "creepy that it's gonna latch on your", "42:01", "nerves yeah and improve you yeah neuro", "42:05", "ladies won't need your phone anymore Wow", "42:07", "and where's you went to the back your", "42:10", "head everyone goes to the back of their", "42:12", "head", "42:12", "well my name is useful I mean like the", "42:17", "matrix", "42:18", "everybody goes to the back of the head", "42:19", "yeah I mean they're right now companies", "42:22", "that want to make money in the short", "42:24", "term are building these non-surgical", "42:26", "non-invasive things we like wear", "42:28", "something on the front of your head or a", "42:30", "cap or something like that", "42:31", "which can detect frequencies of", "42:33", "vibrations in your brain and you can", "42:34", "it's very primitive but you can move", "42:36", "things around you can control drones", "42:38", "right with your brain without touching", "42:40", "anything but yeah the if it ever becomes", "42:44", "practical which is very far from certain", "42:45", "but the thing to imagine in the far out", "42:49", "science fiction scenario is cracking", "42:51", "open your skull and searching some", "42:52", "electrodes in there closing it back up", "42:54", "and now you were part of the super", "42:57", "internet without doing anything more", "42:59", "than closing your eyes yeah and there's", "43:00", "also the possibility of enhancing", "43:03", "various thought processes to with", "43:06", "transdermal stimulation like if they", "43:08", "could figure out you know they're doing", "43:09", "that now they're they've performed a", "43:11", "series of tests where they have people", "43:13", "do like certain tasks and then they put", "43:17", "electrodes into certain areas of the", "43:19", "brain and put an electric charge and", "43:21", "that electric charge stimulates various", "43:24", "aspects of the brain and it allows them", "43:26", "to complete certain tasks quicker and", "43:28", "more efficiently you know I think and", "43:31", "this is just kind of uninformed belief", "43:33", "but I suspect that the human brain is", "43:36", "pretty optimized for what it tries to do", "43:38", "I think that rather than improving the", "43:41", "brain are stimulating it the way forward", "43:42", "is to augment it like hook it up to", "43:44", "calculators and Internet and whatever", "43:46", "you know one thing that I don't see", "43:49", "talked about very much but I think will", "43:51", "be a real game-changer you know we we", "43:53", "talk about phones as if we're carrying", "43:54", "around phones but we don't mostly use", "43:57", "our phones to talk to people on the", "43:59", "phone right we check the email check the", "44:01", "internet and we take pictures once you", "44:03", "really have and again it might not be", "44:05", "possible but if you really had", "44:07", "a direct connection between your brain", "44:10", "and the internet your eyeballs are a", "44:12", "video camera everything you see you can", "44:15", "record and and store somewhere right so", "44:18", "and you can lend them to other people or", "44:21", "people can subpoena them or whatever", "44:23", "like there's literally no place in the", "44:25", "world that human eyeballs are looking at", "44:27", "that would not be subject to later", "44:29", "inspection and that it's weird and scary", "44:32", "and bad right it is where he's carrying", "44:34", "bad and what if someone comes up with a", "44:35", "better eyeball oh yeah they let you", "44:37", "scoop out your old dull eyes and put in", "44:40", "some new awesome ones you can record", "44:42", "with yeah absolutely yeah I don't think", "44:45", "that Nessa", "44:46", "I absolutely agree that enhancing it", "44:49", "with electronics is probably the way to", "44:51", "go and that having some sort of some", "44:54", "sort of symbiotic relationship with", "44:55", "electronics but I also think that this", "44:58", "transdermal stimulation can enhance that", "45:00", "process on top of it I think there's", "45:02", "gonna be a bunch of different things", "45:03", "going on at once you think about CRISPR", "45:06", "being something where someone eventually", "45:09", "figures out a way to design various", "45:12", "aspects of the human brain that are more", "45:14", "open to interface with technology", "45:16", "changing various receptors make them", "45:20", "more efficient for data to go straight", "45:23", "to the dome yeah and I think that there", "45:25", "is a short-term versus long-term", "45:26", "question here right like even if what I", "45:28", "said is a long-term truth on the", "45:30", "short-term improving our thinking skills", "45:32", "in direct ways with stimulation or", "45:34", "whatever sounds you know pretty good but", "45:35", "maybe you can just do that through beta", "45:37", "blockers or some drugs or something like", "45:39", "like I think that that's another thing", "45:41", "very plausible that we'll have safe", "45:44", "super efficient drugs someone can take", "45:46", "in over the next six hours their their", "45:48", "way clearer thinkers than they were", "45:50", "before", "45:50", "yeah is there any concern with what's", "45:53", "the endgame like with this yeah I hope", "45:56", "so I mean if you're super far advanced", "45:59", "the endgame is you realize that life is", "46:01", "not that interesting yeah you're like", "46:05", "well why am I here what am i doing with", "46:06", "all this yeah a little challenge is", "46:08", "helpful actually well in particular if", "46:09", "you develop immortality yeah if there's", "46:12", "no concern about getting injured or", "46:14", "killed yeah I think that people who", "46:19", "invision super far ahead science fiction", "46:22", "scenarios and especially people who", "46:24", "envision uploading brains and", "46:26", "consciousness underestimate the", "46:29", "importance of our bodies to who we are", "46:32", "as human beings right not just that", "46:34", "we're in a body but like hunger thirst", "46:38", "exhaustion me horny like these are", "46:42", "motivating factors that really affect", "46:44", "who we are and what we say and what we", "46:46", "do and if you remove all that if you're", "46:48", "just a thinking processor in a computer", "46:50", "what's your motivation why are you going", "46:52", "on write like why are you doing anything", "46:54", "at all like I don't think it'll be I", "46:55", "don't think it'll be anything like the", "46:57", "personality the person who you are if", "46:59", "your body is taken away that's the big", "47:02", "question about artificial life right or", "47:04", "artificial intelligence rather like what", "47:07", "what we have very specific needs that", "47:10", "are addressed by our ambitions right", "47:12", "biological needs the idea of you know", "47:15", "transferring your genes keeping your", "47:17", "your bloodline going all that stuff yeah", "47:20", "there's all these survival instincts", "47:22", "that we have that you'd necessarily", "47:23", "wouldn't necessarily have if you were an", "47:26", "artificial life-form like why would you", "47:27", "care if someone pulled the plug on you", "47:28", "why would you try to survive what do you", "47:30", "what's your purpose here right exact", "47:32", "seems sort of futile if you're there's a", "47:34", "lot of talk in AI existential risk", "47:37", "community like worrying about artificial", "47:39", "intelligence about value alignment like", "47:42", "making sure that the AIS value the same", "47:45", "things that we do like our existence for", "47:47", "example yeah and but I think a little", "47:50", "bit at least what I hear and I'm not an", "47:52", "expert but right here it seems a little", "47:53", "bit off the mark because they're talking", "47:56", "about what to program into the AI but if", "47:59", "it's in any sense really an AI it can", "48:02", "reprogram itself right like you can", "48:05", "change your mind as they can be you can", "48:07", "change your values you can change your", "48:08", "motivations artificial intelligences", "48:11", "should be able to do the same thing and", "48:13", "in fact they better be able to do that", "48:15", "if they're going to be truly intelligent", "48:16", "if they're if we're gonna mimic what a", "48:18", "human being can do it can't be something", "48:20", "where we program them to just do a task", "48:22", "because that's not intelligent right so", "48:25", "if that happens there then you know who", "48:27", "knows what they're gonna eventually be", "48:29", "motivated to do if anything like you", "48:30", "said like what is their motivation even", "48:32", "to do anything at all", "48:33", "even to exist well isn't one of the big", "48:35", "concerns is that in releasing artificial", "48:38", "technology and giving it autonomy that", "48:41", "we're gonna do is like start a process", "48:44", "that's some sort of a perpetual", "48:48", "exponential domino effect of

"devices to carry you around mechanical", "50:27", "transportation in the late 1800s they", "50:30", "imagined a mechanical horse yes they", "50:32", "knew the horses existed right and the", "50:34", "car was a totally different thing and", "50:36", "people hadn't thought of that originally", "50:37", "and then when people did think of cars", "50:38", "they thought of flying cars because they", "50:40", "saw they were flying animals right and", "50:41", "the flying cars haven't appeared because", "50:43", "we we didn't what they should have been", "50:45", "thinking about is how would", "50:46", "our car is going to change our cities", "50:48", "and our commutes and how we live right", "50:51", "when people invented the internet that", "50:53", "what they weren't sure what they were", "50:54", "gonna do with it", "50:55", "and I think that the same thing is true", "50:56", "and when if we can imagine blending the", "50:59", "barrier between our biological existence", "51:01", "and some virtual existence wouldn't even", "51:04", "know what questions to ask about that", "51:06", "yeah and I think we are getting close to", "51:08", "those other things you mentioned though", "51:10", "Boston Dynamics is getting really close", "51:12", "to artificial dogs and artificial horses", "51:15", "yeah I mean they have things you can't", "51:18", "kick you kick them and they don't get", "51:20", "knocked over indoors yes they can jump", "51:23", "like incredible distances like", "51:25", "incredible Heights there's there's some", "51:27", "amazing ones that do

and like I said it's we", "52:38", "don't even know it's easy to extrapolate", "52:41", "right ahead to sort of the senses", "52:44", "there it is oh yeah that's from the", "52:46", "episode it's a

I mean there's there's", "52:57", "a real concern I mean we're doing it", "52:59", "right now with", "53:01", "you know if you talk to people that are", "53:02", "really that paid attention studied

good", "53:28", "possibility this person's in here", "53:29", "fuck it nuke the building yeah and we're", "53:32", "doing that yes it's absolutely happening", "53:33", "but on the other hand the drones are", "53:35", "also delivering pizzas are they though", "53:37", "these kind of pizza with a drone think", "53:40", "so if you looked at the amount of people", "53:41", "that have delivered pizzas with drones", "53:43", "versus the amount of people that have", "53:44", "been killed by drones skilling is bigger", "53:47", "well the innocents are the scariest", "53:48", "drones are really good at killing", "53:50", "innocent people yeah not so good at", "53:52", "killing the people that are specific", "53:54", "target targets but I think my point is", "53:56", "just that there are gonna be pluses in -", "53:59", "yes right so I think that it's gonna", "54:01", "change like if we if we combine this", "54:03", "idea of you know interfacing with", "54:06", "computers with this idea of drones doing", "54:08", "some drudgery work with this idea of", "54:09", "giving people a basic income", "54:10", "everyone is just gonna sit in their", "54:13", "rooms and right on their

create virtual reality", "54:23", "that's indistinguishable from regular", "54:25", "reality and people are gonna live in", "54:26", "there like ready player one", "54:28", "well it'll be better that kind of thing", "54:29", "I think the the big flaw to me and", "54:31", "things like Tron or ready player one is", "54:33", "that they make a virtual reality look", "54:34", "too much like the real reality there's", "54:36", "no reason why virtual reality has to", "54:37", "have gravity right there's no reason why", "54:40", "it has to be three-dimensional there's", "54:42", "no reason why you know any limit on how", "54:45", "strong you are or how fast you are any", "54:47", "yeah like there's no reason why you have", "54:49", "to have only one body I mean there's a", "54:50", "million different ways in which it could", "54:51", "be very very well it also could be", "54:53", "implemented with something like the tank", "54:55", "the float tank that we were talking", "54:56", "about earlier I mean you could climb", "54:58", "into that float tank with some sort of", "55:00", "apparatus hook these gloves on put this", "55:03", "helmet over and literally not be subject", "55:07", "to the whims of gravity can't even feel", "55:08", "it the effects of gravity will be", "55:10", "inconsequential because you will feel", "55:13", "like you're floating and then from there", "55:15", "you'll be able to fly around and do all", "55:17", "sorts of yeah I think like this weird", "55:19", "period between you know the year 1900", "55:22", "and 2000 or 2100 or whatever it's gonna", "55:25", "be it'll be a weird transitional period", "55:29", "in human history where we invented", "55:30", "technology and not really put it to work", "55:32", "yet and there might be some equilibrium", "55:34", "that we reach in 100 or 200 years where", "55:36", "the whole mode of life is utterly", "55:38", "different than what it is now if you", "55:40", "could put priorities in terms of like", "55:42", "what you think people should concentrate", "55:44", "on first with in regards to this kind of", "55:48", "stuff what do you think those would be", "55:50", "like if someone said Sean you're a super", "55:52", "smart dude let's let's get on the ball", "55:55", "here figure out what what direction", "55:57", "should we take this in I mean what I do", "55:58", "for a living is more like foundational", "56:01", "what are the laws of physics kind of", "56:02", "things right so I'm not the person to", "56:04", "speculate on this well I think this is", "56:08", "why I said earlier like a thing we", "56:10", "should be talking to each other because", "56:11", "nobody is no one person is right like", "56:13", "that's why we need to have people from", "56:15", "different areas of expertise talk about", "56:17", "each other's areas if only then to be", "56:19", "corrected right but you know to be open", "56:21", "to that dialogue so I think that for", "56:23", "example an enormous amount of effort has", "56:25", "been put into nanotechnology building", "56:28", "tiny little machines", "56:29", "I suspect that mostly the real advances", "56:33", "they're not going to be nanotechnology", "56:35", "but in synthetic biology where you take", "56:37", "bacteria or multicellular organisms that", "56:39", "already exists and adapt them for your", "56:41", "purposes make them do whatever you want", "56:42", "because biology has already solved a lot", "56:44", "of the problems that technology is still", "56:47", "struggling to figure out so the concept", "56:49", "of nanotechnology is you're going to", "56:50", "take like almost like a cell sized", "56:52", "machine right and many of them gonna go", "56:54", "into your body and find areas that are", "56:56", "damaged or whatever yeah there's a woman", "57:02", "a professor at Caltech who gave a talk a", "57:03", "few months ago about he builds robots", "57:06", "out of DNA hmm so these little DNA", "57:08", "robots can go in and right now they're", "57:11", "at the level what they can do is sort", "57:12", "things so like if they have molecule one", "57:15", "and molecule two scattered across some", "57:17", "surface this little DNA robot will go in", "57:19", "and move all molecule one to the left", "57:21", "all of molecule due to the right and so", "57:24", "she says that's the beginning like in", "57:26", "the future you'll have your", "57:27", "DNA box and you'll say you know I'm", "57:29", "allergic to Tomatoes and then it will", "57:32", "invent a little machine that will run", "57:34", "through your body and fix your allergy", "57:36", "to Tomatoes right you don't need that", "57:37", "anymore with a machine with a DNA robot", "57:42", "so it's little so why DNA because you", "57:44", "think of DNA is carrying the genetic", "57:45", "code but DNA is a wonderful molecule", "57:47", "because it is relatively stable but it's", "57:51", "not just a crystal right it's not just", "57:52", "doing the same thing over and over again", "57:54", "so it contains information and it can", "57:57", "adapt it can it can you know hold on and", "58:00", "grab on to certain things and let go and", "58:01", "and do things so DNA is a wonderful", "58:04", "testing ground for building little", "58:07", "really really tiny things in your body", "58:09", "that will change who you are well here's", "58:11", "a question that's not totally related", "58:13", "but you might be a good person for this", "58:15", "what is quantum computing now I keep", "58:20", "hearing about this that's one of the big", "58:22", "breakthroughs in computers is going to", "58:26", "be quantum computing right I'm almost", "58:29", "the right guy I'm not completely the", "58:30", "regular I actually did teach a course at", "58:31", "Cal Tech that involve quantum computing", "58:33", "so I'm above average so so quantum", "58:40", "mechanics this is the book that I'm", "58:42", "writing right now that's gonna be out a", "58:44", "year from now called something deeply", "58:45", "hidden it'll be about quantum mechanics", "58:47", "and the goal of the book will be to make", "58:48", "quantum mechanics understandable to", "58:50", "everybody and convince them that quantum", "58:52", "mechanics really does imply the", "58:53", "existence of multiple worlds where", "58:55", "things look very much the same except", "58:57", "for tiny differences and one way to", "58:59", "think about what quantum mechanics says", "59:01", "is in classical mechanics which is what", "59:03", "came before quantum mechanics let's", "59:05", "imagine you have a bit right that is", "59:07", "something is either zero or one right", "59:09", "one piece of information in quantum", "59:11", "mechanics you have a quantum bit a qubit", "59:14", "as they call it very clever so the", "59:16", "difference is that instead of it being a", "59:19", "zero or a one like it would be", "59:20", "classically quantum mechanically it is", "59:23", "in some superposition of 0 and 1 and", "59:26", "some combination of a little bit zero a", "59:27", "little bit one and it's not that you", "59:29", "don't know which one it is it's that it", "59:32", "really is both it might be 90% 0 and 10%", "59:35", "1 or something like that", "59:36", "so take that fact number one okay fact", "59:40", "number two is that quantum mechanics", "59:41", "says the thing called entanglement which", "59:44", "means that if you have two bits", "59:46", "classically so you have 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1", "59:50", "right 4 different possibilities so", "59:52", "quantum mechanics says it's not that", "59:54", "this one bit is in a combination of 0", "59:57", "and 1 and this other bit is also in a", "59:59", "combination of 0 and 1 it's that the 2", "60:01", "bit system is in a combination of 0 0 0", "60:06", "1 1 0 1 1 right so it might be that it's", "60:09", "50% 0 0 and 50% 1 1 so you don't know", "60:12", "what either bit is but you know they're", "60:14", "the same right so that's entanglement so", "60:17", "you take these two ideas that you have a", "60:19", "combination of zeros and ones rather", "60:21", "than just one or the other and the", "60:23", "different bits can be entangled with", "60:24", "each other and then you just say well", "60:26", "what is a computer computer something he", "60:28", "takes bits in does manipulations and", "60:30", "spits out the answer right you solve", "60:33", "problems you that's what's literally", "60:34", "going on in your computer is a bunch of", "60:36", "zeros and ones being pushed around so a", "60:38", "quantum computer is pushing around a", "60:39", "bunch of qubits right bunch of spinning", "60:42", "particles or something like that the", "60:43", "spin of a particle that can either be", "60:45", "spinning clockwise or counter clockwise", "60:46", "is a qubit and so these particles can", "60:50", "interact with each other they can become", "60:51", "entangled and you invent a quantum", "60:54", "algorithm right like there's algorithms", "60:56", "for you know finding the area of a", "60:58", "surface or something like that factoring", "61:00", "large numbers you know solving the", "61:03", "shortest distance between two different", "61:04", "points you can do this using the rules", "61:08", "of quantum mechanics instead of the", "61:09", "rules of classical mechanics and the", "61:10", "belief which is not yet 100% established", "61:13", "but we think is true is that there are", "61:15", "some problems that are really really", "61:18", "hard to solve for a classical computer", "61:20", "which means that you can easily make the", "61:22", "problem long enough that it would take", "61:23", "the lifetime of the universe to solve it", "61:25", "on a classical computer which quantum", "61:28", "computers can solve quite quickly and", "61:29", "efficiently and so it's we're not we", "61:33", "haven't proven that it's not", "61:34", "mathematically why is this why would", "61:36", "they think that quantum computers would", "61:37", "be able to solve it quicker", "61:38", "there's more information in the quantum", "61:40", "computer like if you have two bits 0 0 0", "61:44", "1 etc there's only four things it can be", "61:46", "right if you have a quantum computers an", "61:48", "infinite number of things it can be", "61:50", "because it's any combination of those", "61:52", "four things right ten present this 20%", "61:54", "that so there's like a continuum of", "61:56", "possibilities it's it's analog rather", "61:58", "than digital in some sense and so what", "62:01", "you what you can do you know the quantum", "62:03", "computer can just sort of take advantage", "62:05", "of that extra power to look I mean", "62:10", "because of this entanglement what this", "62:12", "is this is I'm gonna get in trouble with", "62:13", "my quantum computing friends cuz not", "62:15", "quite fair but roughly speaking rather", "62:17", "than manipulating bit by bit because of", "62:20", "the entanglement between the bits the", "62:22", "quantum computer can move all the bits a", "62:23", "little bit at once so let's say that", "62:26", "you're you're searching for something in", "62:28", "a list right a very elementary computer", "62:31", "science program is I'm giving you a list", "62:33", "find an element that is equal to a", "62:35", "certain number right right it sounds", "62:37", "easy but if that list is 10 trillion", "62:38", "things long that's hard right so what", "62:41", "the quantum computer can do is say take", "62:42", "every element in the list nudge it a", "62:45", "little bit towards zero if it's the", "62:48", "wrong answer in towards one if it's the", "62:49", "right answer and you don't know where it", "62:51", "is in the list but you can do that", "62:53", "nudging over and over again at the end", "62:54", "of the day look for where's the one it's", "62:56", "very easy to find so you can get the", "62:58", "answer much quicker it is believed and", "63:01", "so things like cryptography privacy", "63:05", "right are dramatically changed by this", "63:06", "because if one of the things that we", "63:08", "think quantum computers should be able", "63:09", "to do faster is factor large numbers", "63:12", "which is the the the the difficulty in", "63:15", "factoring large numbers is the basis for", "63:17", "much modern cryptography but also", "63:20", "simulating systems that were just too", "63:22", "difficult to simulate you know just just", "63:24", "it took too much computer power to do it", "63:26", "now maybe we can do it because nature is", "63:28", "truly quantum mechanical at the core it", "63:31", "turns out to be very hard because the", "63:32", "problem is you have all these bits if", "63:34", "you touch one of them if the outside", "63:36", "world bumps into one of them right like", "63:38", "a cosmic ray or atom hits it and the", "63:40", "whole entanglement is ruined between", "63:42", "everything so it's very very delicate", "63:44", "and that's what the you know right now", "63:47", "they're they're working on systems of", "63:50", "let's say dozens of qubits", "63:51", "entangled at once you would you would", "63:53", "like it to be way more than that because", "63:56", "you can store an enormous amount of", "63:57", "information in these things and if it", "64:01", "works is I think it'll be way", "64:03", "better at computing if it works I'm not", "64:06", "at all sure that quantum computers will", "64:07", "be efficient or cost-effective or", "64:10", "anything like that in the near term but", "64:12", "you know doing computations faster is", "64:14", "something a lot of people want to be", "64:15", "able to do so right now they're working", "64:17", "with dozens of qubits and what's", "64:19", "preventing them from expanding that or", "64:21", "they doing it slowly sort of make sure", "64:23", "that it all works correctly and get a", "64:26", "accurate model yeah so the problem is if", "64:29", "you had a qubit it can be in a", "64:31", "combination of 0 or 1 right", "64:33", "any combination whatsoever but as soon", "64:34", "as you look at it you never see the", "64:37", "combination you see zero or you see 1", "64:39", "that's it and you've ruined you've", "64:42", "erased this pre-existing combination", "64:44", "right if you see zero now it's in the", "64:46", "state 0 Brian C 1 it's in the state 1 so", "64:49", "if you have a group of many many qubits", "64:51", "what I mean by look at is literally", "64:53", "anything else in the world bumping into", "64:55", "it so like if like I said if photons hit", "64:58", "it if particles", "64:59", "you know if molecules of air and oxygen", "65:02", "or nitrogen bump into the qubit that'll", "65:05", "count as an observation and it will", "65:07", "collapse as we say it collapses the", "65:09", "wavefunction and all of your quantum", "65:11", "information is ruined so you have to", "65:14", "make the most sort of very cold very", "65:15", "isolated very shielded from external", "65:18", "influences and the more qubits you add", "65:19", "the heart of that is to do now is there", "65:23", "a proof of concept this yep they have", "65:25", "working quantum computers I forget there", "65:29", "was a joke Scott Aaronson who's a friend", "65:30", "of mine is a genius theoretical computer", "65:33", "scientist used to joke that the quantum", "65:36", "computers are able to say that the", "65:38", "number 15 is equal to 5 times 3 with", "65:41", "very high probability that was the state", "65:43", "of the art I think they're able to say", "65:44", "the 21 equals 3 times 7 with very high", "65:46", "probability now but what you would like", "65:49", "to say is you know some hundred digit", "65:50", "number is the product of two other", "65:52", "numbers not able to do that right now", "65:53", "now what are they looking at with this", "65:56", "when they're looking in terms of the", "65:58", "future this stuff what are the how do", "66:01", "they want to implement this lots of",

that", "66:20", "this is way beyond what I actually know", "66:22", "about but also you know this sort of", "66:24", "side light of this is that this in", "66:26", "existence of entanglement is kind of a", "66:29", "shared information between two different", "66:31", "things in a way that classical physics", "66:33", "just would not allow and that's", "66:36", "interesting and exciting because

and it was invented by", "71:25", "a graduate student Hugh Everett in the", "71:27", "1950s who was instantly kicked out of", "71:29", "physics yeah oh yeah if there's a long", "71:32", "one glorious

clockwise", "73:20", "you always see one or the other and", "73:22", "everett says that's because you have a", "73:25", "wavefunction you live as a superposition", "73:27", "of different possibilities and when you", "73:29", "look at the electron what happens is", "73:31", "before there was you and there's an", "73:34", "electron and a combination of", "73:36", "counterclockwise and clockwise

this is where", "77:56", "the it actually becomes interesting to", "77:59", "talk about the vocabulary we use right", "78:01", "yes because it becomes very very hard to", "78:04", "know where to attach the word I or you", "78:07", "when you're talking about this like you", "78:09", "you tend to say I made a decision okay", "78:12", "that's fine right I decided to have this", "78:14", "can of

have decided", "78:24", "otherwise and if you define yourself as", "78:28", "the following list of atoms and", "78:30", "particles in a certain configuration", "78:31", "then no then the laws of

that says", "78:41", "I'm a person and I kind of like coffee", "78:43", "but I already had a cup this morning and", "78:45", "no there's a chance there's a", "78:46", "probability like you say that I would", "78:48", "drink this and a probability that I", "78:50", "would not and those are completely", "78:52", "compatible you know they're different", "78:54", "the only way you get into trouble is if", "78:55", "you mix up those two different ways of", "78:58", "talking if you say like I chose to have", "79:00", "the coffee because my atoms were in a", "79:02", "following configuration or something", "79:03", "like that right that's like talking", "79:05", "about us as humans and then switching", "79:06", "vocabularies talking about us as atoms", "79:08", "and that's where you get in trouble yeah", "79:10", "it's a weird reductionist take on what", "79:12", "it means to be a person that thinks yeah", "79:14", "yeah I think you know if if you say like", "79:16", "there's no free will in your atoms then", "79:18", "I'm with you I'm on board but no one in", "79:20", "the world goes through life that way", "79:21", "right for good reason and they never", "79:24", "will it's not gonna happen yeah well he", "79:26", "and you could break that all the way", "79:28", "down to creativity right like what when", "79:31", "someone sits down", "79:32", "right something like where's all that", "79:34", "coming from yes I think again there's", "79:36", "room as well there is an interesting", "79:38", "question about you know how much we will", "79:41", "ultimately be able to unpack and", "79:43", "understand about that right right now", "79:45", "the brain is kind of just a mystery box", "79:46", "to us and there's so much we don't know", "79:49", "about what how people make decisions how", "79:51", "they remember things how they come up", "79:53", "with new ideas so so where it matters is", "79:57", "how we treat people right like the", "80:00", "obvious case is responsibility blame", "80:03", "like if if you think that a person makes", "80:06", "choices then you can assign", "80:08", "responsibility to them for making the", "80:09", "choices they made yes that's what we do", "80:11", "in the world if someone chooses to rob a", "80:13", "bank we choose to put them in jail right", "80:15", "yes and someone someone could come along", "80:18", "and say no one ever does this but", "80:19", "someone could come along and say well", "80:20", "they're just a bunch of Adams baying", "80:22", "laws of physics how can you blame them", "80:24", "right that would be dopey that doesn't", "80:26", "make any sense right but what if you", "80:29", "were Minority Report right what if you", "80:31", "could like put someone in an MRI in a", "80:34", "brain scanner and say yeah you know what", "80:35", "tomorrow they're gonna rob a bank do you", "80:38", "arrest them is that is that enough right", "80:41", "the fact that their brain was hooked up", "80:44", "to to violate the law in the future is", "80:46", "that enough to assign personal", "80:48", "responsibility to them for that or do", "80:49", "you or do you do the opposite and say", "80:51", "well it's gonna happen no matter what we", "80:52", "can't really blame them well and also if", "80:54", "you do catch this thought process is", "80:57", "before the actual action takes place", "80:59", "isn't it possible to correct that", "81:01", "thought process with education or some", "81:04", "sort of awareness training or something", "81:06", "where you could shift the consciousness", "81:08", "and abruptly sort of disassemble", "81:13", "determinism at its most problematic", "81:16", "point yeah so there's there's a whole", "81:19", "kind of interesting set of ideas that", "81:23", "are very popular among philosophers", "81:24", "right now which is the question of moral", "81:27", "luck ooh", "81:28", "so if you're driving down the street and", "81:31", "you're buzzed you're drunk right maybe", "81:34", "you get home fine maybe someone jumps in", "81:37", "front of your car and you run them over", "81:38", "because you don't have the agility or", "81:41", "the reflexes because you're drunk", "81:42", "right so you're the same person", "81:45", "you went home you're drunk and you're", "81:47", "driving home right but depending on the", "81:49", "outside world you ran someone over and", "81:51", "killed them where you didn't but in the", "81:53", "world we blame the person who ran", "81:55", "somebody over we punished them much more", "81:57", "severely than the person who got home", "81:59", "safely right that's not their", "82:01", "responsibility they sort of got unlucky", "82:03", "there in the world so should we blame",

"82:13", "human beings at the thinking about these", "82:14", "probabilistic counterfactual questions", "82:16", "yeah that's a good one that is yeah", "82:19", "mm-hmm yeah what who are you then yeah", "82:24", "are you lucky oh yeah right I mean so", "82:27", "much of what happens to us in life we", "82:29", "don't get responsibility for sure I mean", "82:31", "we're interfacing with randomness every", "82:33", "time we step out the door that's right", "82:34", "but can you treat people that way", "82:38", "consistently it's hard it's tricky I'm", "82:40", "not giving the answer because I don't", "82:41", "know I'm right yeah this is this is", "82:43", "tricky stuff we're certainly not like if", "82:45", "you lived in a world where you thought", "82:48", "that what happened in the world was", "82:50", "preordained that there was all the great", "82:53", "playing out as a master plan or at the", "82:54", "very least that there was some sort of", "82:57", "karmic influence that made good things", "83:00", "happen to good people bad things happen", "83:02", "to bad people then the world makes more", "83:04", "sense right yeah I don't believe any of", "83:06", "that stuff

though", "109:12", "I'm an atheist I'm I'm very happy to", "109:15", "explain why I don't think that God", "109:16", "exists but I don't blame religion most", "109:20", "of the time for people's bad

many", "111:07", "reasons why I think that it's not really", "111:09", "credible to be religious intellectually", "111:12", "is because if in the classic traditional", "111:16", "Western religious

would have done a much better job of", "111:35", "explaining himself to us right look why", "111:38", "would God give us his message through a", "111:40", "bunch of people in a tiny country who",

"112:36", "that's controlling the destiny of", "112:38", "everything yeah so number one I think", "112:41", "that the idea of omnipotence was", "112:42", "actually somewhat late coming onto the", "112:44", "scene right like if you dig into what", "112:48", "was happening before 2,000 years ago you", "112:51", "know the Hebrew God", "112:52", "it was not omnipotent at the beginning", "112:54", "right I mean the Hebrews came out of a", "112:56", "polytheistic society where there were", "112:58", "lots of different gods around and you", "113:00", "can trace how their God evolved over", "113:03", "time and first you know became their God", "113:06", "right like this was one god that the", "113:08", "Hebrews were you know worshipping and", "113:11", "the Egyptians and the

ones don't even", "113:19", "exist right it was an evolution over", "113:21", "time and omnipotence came late like you", "113:24", "would talk about the gods quarreling if", "113:25", "you were a

"who disagree with each other right", "113:35", "suddenly lots of aspects of realities", "113:37", "you know come into focus", "113:39", "but the idea there's supernatural very", "113:41", "powerful

up", "114:10", "there in the sky or something like I", "114:11", "don't think it's that hard to imagine", "114:12", "that all sorts of different cultures", "114:14", "would evolve do you think it's also a", "114:16", "function of us growing up with mentors", "114:18", "and father figures and leaders and", "114:20", "chieftains and there's always someone", "114:22", "who is the big the Big Kahuna

I think", "115:33", "it's it goes back to the motivation we", "115:35", "have as having bodies versus being in a", "115:37", "computer like there's plenty of reasons", "115:39", "to do different

in agreement there my wife", "123:23", "Jennifer will let - as a science writer", "123:25", "wrote a book called me myself and why", "123:27", "searching for the science of self and", "123:30", "one of our friends said oh if you're", "123:32", "gonna write a book about the self you", "123:33", "gotta do LSD and so we did and she", "123:37", "researched it and it's a fascinating", "123:39",

"123:50", "it's never fun to die right but it", "123:52", "absolutely helped ease that journey in a", "123:55", "very simple way but", "123:56", "just as we are a sort of immature", "123:59", "society that doesn't want to face up to", "124:02", "the reality of our eventual deaths we're", "124:05", "also very culturally conservative and", "124:06", "squeamish about drugs right and so we", "124:09",

taking", "124:52", "psilocybin before they die and letting", "124:54", "them ease their way through this but you", "124:57", "know it's the same reaction that doesn't", "125:00", "want people to have a basic income right", "125:02", "there is a sort of moral feeling that", "125:05", "you're weak you don't struggle against", "125:08", "death everything and it's silly right", "125:10", "yeah very very common yeah it's so weird", "125:13", "that that that the the universal basic", "125:17", "income topic is one of those knee-jerk", "125:19", "reaction or topics that I myself my", "125:21",

"125:31", "gonna get lazy yeah and then the more I", "125:33", "thought about it I was like well if you", "125:34", "just cover their food and their round", "125:37", "house are they really gonna get is it", "125:39", "really gonna kill their ambition like", "125:40", "why would that kill it is our own amp is", "125:42", "our ambition uniquely tied to just", "125:45", "survival that doesn't make any sense", "125:48", "well and it's a weird it's the same", "125:49", "weird thing that people use against you", "125:52", "know having a progressive tax system", "125:53", "like if we have if we tax people's money", "125:56", "they won't want to work anymore", "125:57", "right but you know if you know you still", "125:59", "want more money like we don't some so", "126:01", "much that you have less money the hard", "126:02", "work that's not how it works and I think", "126:05", "like what so but but also for the for", "126:08", "the universal basic income stuff I think", "126:09", "people have to reconcile", "126:10", "selves so what if someone wants to just", "126:13", "sit around and play video games all day", "126:14", "Brian is that the worst thing in the", "126:16", "world like I mean I think for that there", "126:19", "will be people like that there will", "126:20", "still be other people who want to write", "126:22", "poetry and build sailboats and you know", "126:24", "build spacecraft etc or build artificial", "126:27", "intelligence and you wouldn't what if", "126:29", "everyone you know could do whatever they", "126:30", "want when they were kids when they're 10", "126:32", "years old they were alert they were", "126:33", "taught a good programming language and", "126:35", "could you know make up whatever apps and", "126:36", "programs they wanted like that would be", "126:38", "a whole different world than what we", "126:40", "live in right now and it might be very", "126:41", "exciting", "126:42", "well creatively it could possibly expand", "126:46", "a lot of people's potentials right where", "126:48", "they no longer have to have a job so", "126:51", "they could do whatever this one thing is", "126:54", "that they were thinking about doing", "126:55", "write a book screenplay develop", "126:58", "something and and and in the short term", "127:00", "I don't know if a basic income works", "127:01", "sort of economically but I think that if", "127:03", "we believe that there's more and more", "127:05", "stuff that can be done by computers or", "127:07", "by robots or whatever automation then", "127:10", "it's absolutely something that should be", "127:12", "taken seriously yeah so I think that", "127:13", "this is the whole thing this is great", "127:15", "because we've been talking in a lot of", "127:16", "different angles about the fact that the", "127:18", "shape of the world is changing in a way", "127:21", "that makes what it means to be human", "127:23", "changing yeah and facing up to what", "127:26", "those changes are the fact that we die", "127:28", "the fact that we make up purpose and", "127:30", "meaning for ourselves and our lives and", "127:32", "the fact that what we are physically in", "127:35", "terms of bodies and and machines and so", "127:38", "forth is also changing so and there's", "127:40", "you know part of the theme of my podcast", "127:42", "I hope is that to think through some of", "127:45", "these issues to sort of I don't know the", "127:46", "answers but when I ask the questions", "127:48", "about you know who we are what we're", "127:50", "living what should we should be doing", "127:51", "about it because God's not gonna give us", "127:52", "the answer well I think podcasts like", "127:55", "yours and it mean any podcast where", "127:58", "people are really carefully considering", "128:02", "issues the I think what's important", "128:05", "about them that really didn't exist", "128:07", "before is that someone can sort of", "128:11", "digest these very complex subjects", "128:14", "through two people having a conversation", "128:17", "about it that perhaps are more informed", "128:19", "and", "128:20", "more data and have more experiment have", "128:22", "more thought about these particular", "128:24", "issues so what you can do and what Sam", "128:28", "Harris can do and a lot of people can do", "128:29", "that are creating these podcasts about", "128:31", "these really complex issues is you start", "128:34", "that conversation and this seed gets", "128:37", "planted into someone's head and maybe", "128:39", "they carry with them at work they carry", "128:40", "with them carry with them when they're", "128:42", "on the subway or during the commute home", "128:44", "and then they become a part of the", "128:46", "broader conversation that we have as a", "128:48", "culture exactly yeah and that's why I", "128:50", "sort of want to not draw a distinction", "128:52", "between science and other ways of", "128:54", "thinking deeply about the world because", "128:56", "I want people to you know I've often", "128:59", "said this as a joke I want to live in a", "129:01", "world where people work hard in the", "129:03", "factory and they go out for a drink", "129:04", "afterward and talk about their favorite", "129:06", "interpretation of quantum mechanics", "129:07", "right the kind of thing people they're", "129:10", "bullshitting about you know over beers", "129:12", "that view I want to live is that possum", "129:16", "mechanics conversation in a bar there", "129:18", "are far too many people who think they", "129:20", "understand something about quantum", "129:21", "mechanics and are gonna explain it to me", "129:22", "so I'm what the existing conversations", "129:25", "to be a little bit more informaiton", "129:26", "formed yeah well it's there's a few", "129:29", "people online that someone is try to get", "129:32", "this guy on and then I've listened to", "129:34", "them talk I'm like I'm pretty sure that", "129:37", "that guy's full of shit yeah but I can't", "129:39", "really point out how I know that a lot", "129:41", "of crack but feel free to email me I", "129:42", "will help you out if yeah well I don't", "129:44", "want to bring this one guy up on but", "129:46", "I'll talk to you about I got there yeah", "129:47", "there's a lot of wooooh out there but", "129:50", "also it's quantum mechanics a lot of", "129:52", "very respectable people who sound crazy", "129:54", "if you don't know too deeply what", "129:56", "they're what they're saying so well that", "129:57", "is the Fineman quote right if you think", "130:00", "you know quantum mechanics you", "130:01", "definitely don't know quantum mechanics", "130:02", "exactly which is the whole point of my", "130:04", "book is to overcome that feeling because", "130:06", "I think what happened is you know it's", "130:09", "true that we don't agree we physicists", "130:11", "don't agree on what quantum mechanics", "130:12", "says but we now Feder sighs the fact", "130:15", "that we don't understand it like it's", "130:16", "good that we don't understand it like if", "130:18", "you try to understand it too hard you're", "130:20", "wasting your time like yeah I so", "130:22", "disagree with that point of view so I", "130:24", "think the quantum mechanics is and", "130:26", "should be understandable by everybody", "130:28", "what a squirrely concept it's it's yeah", "130:32", "yeah it's it's weird and that's why a", "130:35", "lot of people there's a lot of people", "130:36", "who I know who friends of mine who are", "130:38", "professors in philosophy departments", "130:40", "because they got a PhD in physics and", "130:44", "they realize what they really wanted to", "130:45", "do was to think about quantum mechanics", "130:46", "at a deep way and they would never get a", "130:49", "job in the physics department doing that", "130:50", "to put philosophy would let them do it", "130:52", "oh wow yeah", "130:54", "interesting what they're really doing is", "130:56", "physics but they're doing it in a way", "130:58", "that philosophers are happy with and", "131:00", "physicists aren't what year did the", "131:02", "concept of quantum mechanics become", "131:04", "inverted invented in started it started", "131:08", "in 1900 exactly but they sort of", "131:10", "perfected the modern version around 1927", "131:12", "well what was the original thought", "131:15", "process do you know yeah it's uh it was", "131:18", "it's the the history is amazing and", "131:22", "messy because they didn't have so much", "131:24", "weirdness going on it was max plunk", "131:27", "write of plunk radiation have you ever", "131:29", "heard of that no German physicist so", "131:33", "black body radiation something glows", "131:35", "when you heat it up right so basically", "131:38", "what happens when you heat something up", "131:39", "is all the atoms and molecules start", "131:41", "vibrating there's a lot of charged", "131:43", "particles a charged particle has an", "131:45", "electric field around it and if you", "131:47", "vibrate it the electric field starts", "131:49", "vibrating we

calculation what should that look like", "132:01", "you know if you heat everything up how", "132:03", "much radiation should it give off and", "132:04", "there the problem was it should give off", "132:07", "an infant amount of radiation at very", "132:08", "long wavelengths which is obviously", "132:10", "false right is obviously not how things", "132:12", "really work so there was this blatant", "132:15", "disagreement between everything we", "132:17", "thought we knew because in the in the", "132:19", "19th century in the 1800s people really", "132:23", "thought in physics that they were close", "132:25", "to the answer right they had a picture", "132:27", "where there were particles like", "132:29", "electrons and protons and then there", "132:31", "were fields like the electromagnetic", "132:33", "field in the gravitational field and the", "132:34", "particles were matter and the fields", "132:37", "pushed them together they interacted", "132:38", "they you know they were the forces right", "132:40", "and this picture was so good and so", "132:43", "compelling that people were basically", "132:44", "like we're almost done", "132:46", "physics right we always have it all", "132:47", "figured out and then but there were a", "132:50", "couple of little things like the", "132:51", "blackbody radiation that you made a", "132:53", "prediction it was wildly off and so", "132:55", "they're like well what's going to happen", "132:56", "so plunk says well maybe when this", "132:59", "electromagnetic radiation is emitted", "133:01", "it's not just a continual

no well yeah life", "139:31", "doesn't promise you a rose garden we", "139:35", "found the Higgs boson fairly quickly", "139:36", "after getting the Large Hadron Collider", "139:38", "up to speed we

quantum", "140:55", "mechanics in quantum field theory saying", "140:56", "so there's a known problem it's been", "140:58", "known for a long time called the", "140:59", "hierarchy problem and so even before we", "141:03", "discovered the Higgs we knew it wasn't", "141:04", "that happy we knew is much much lighter", "141:05", "than what it should be so the hierarchy", "141:07", "problem was a known thing and people", "141:09", "said how could it be true well you have", "141:11", "to change the theory a little bit yet", "141:13", "like add some new particles or predict", "141:15", "some new

was going on would find more", "141:26", "particles than just the Higgs boson it's", "141:29", "found nothing else maybe would find", "141:31", "supersymmetry or extra dimensions or", "141:33",

that's the most", "141:43", "frustrating thing because there I mean", "141:47", "people don't want to say this out loud", "141:48", "but here we go since no one's listening", "141:49", "this right the

"yeah what's going on with the the the", "142:23", "basic building blocks of the universe", "142:25", "you have to nourish things into each", "142:27", "other I know yeah well so the secret to", "142:30", "that is that really the world is not", "142:31", "made of particles it's really made of", "142:33", "fields right that's wantem field theory", "142:35", "is the label given to this so for

"jiggles up and down and then you look", "143:26", "and you see in quantum mechanics says", "143:27", "there's a probability we'll look one way", "143:29", "versus another so the way you make it", "143:31", "how in the world do you make a Higgs", "143:32", "boson by colliding protons even though", "143:34", "the Higgs boson is over a hundred times", "143:36", "heavier than a proton right the answer", "143:38", "is really you're setting up vibrations", "143:40", "in the Higgs field which was always", "143:42", "there all along and then you very", "143:44", "quickly actually you can't the

conceptual", "144:00", "switch from particles to fields then the", "144:02", "reason why we need an accelerator and a", "144:04", "Collider to make new particles begins to", "144:06", "make a bit more sense whew doesn't it", "144:09", "don't ya oh I get it now there was", "144:13", "something that I had read I'm", "144:14", "translating one more thing like if", "144:17", "you're in a room with two pianos and you", "144:19", "play one piano the other piano will", "144:22", "start vibrating along with it a little", "144:23", "bit ah that's an interesting way to look", "144:25", "at that's the one field the book the", "144:27", "quarks and the gluons and the protons", "144:29", "start the Higgs field vibrating a little", "144:31", "bit we eventually see I'm glad you", "144:33", "mentioned gluons that's one of the", "144:36", "things that I had read about that they", "144:37", "did they had either discovered or were", "144:41", "able to observe with the Large Hadron", "144:42", "Collider was a believe it's called quark", "144:45", "gluon plasma right you got it right", "144:48", "thank ya", "144:49", "which is an immensely dense thing that", "144:53", "the the the the way they described it", "144:56", "was something like something that was a", "144:57", "fraction the size of a sugar cube would", "144:59", "weigh as much as the earth itself yeah", "145:01", "that's right so usually what you try to", "145:04", "do with particle accelerators is", "145:05", "discovered new particles right so to do", "145:09", "that why haven't you discovered them", "145:10", "already usually it's because they're too", "145:13", "heavy it takes a lot of energy to make", "145:14", "them equals mc-squared if their mass is", "145:17", "big you need a lot of energy in a", "145:19", "smallest possible region that's how you", "145:21", "make new particles so to do that you", "145:23", "take some particles that are pretty", "145:25", "small like protons and you smash them", "145:27", "together and that's how we discover the", "145:28", "Higgs and we're looking for other things", "145:30", "but maybe your goal in life is not to", "145:32", "discover new particles but to understand", "145:34", "the particles that we already know about", "145:35", "right in that case maybe you want to see", "145:38", "what happens when you get like you say a", "145:40", "huge

"what's at the center of the Sun right", "145:49", "but instead of electrons and photons", "145:52", "we're gonna make it a quarks and gluons", "145:54", "so instead of smashing together protons", "145:58", "a proton has three quarks each right we", "146:01", "smash together the nucleus of a heavy", "146:03", "atom like an iron or lead atom right", "146:06", "which as you know", "146:07", "dozens of protons and neutrons in it so", "146:10", "we get as many particles as we can", "146:12", "squeeze together in the same place so", "146:14", "the energy is a bit more diffuse but we", "146:16", "get to study how they interact with each", "146:18", "other because that's what conditions", "146:19", "were like near the Big Bang lots of", "146:21", "particles going on it wasn't just two", "146:22", "particles smacking into each other so", "146:24", "we're learning a lot about what", "146:26", "conditions were like in the very very", "146:27", "early universe what is the mass of this", "146:30", "stuff this quark gluon plasma like", "146:32", "there's there's some insane number that", "146:36", "I remember reading yes but my neural", "146:39", "implant is failing me I do not remember", "146:41", "the number right now but we could google", "146:43", "it yeah it's very dense gigantic you", "146:45", "know it's a bit of a cheat right like", "146:48", "you know so I always I get laughs when I", "146:49", "give talks on the Higgs boson because I", "146:53", "mentioned that they hate the lifetime of", "146:55", "the Higgs boson I already said it", "146:56", "disappears very quickly right so I say", "146:58", "it's one zero second which is true", "147:02", "that's and just like you know you when I", "147:04", "said quadrillion like what is that", "147:05", "number and I said ten and fifteen but", "147:07", "who cares right the point is the depth", "147:09", "Oh seconds really short so I say the", "147:11", "Zepto second which is a really short", "147:13", "period of time and everyone laughs it's", "147:16", "ten to the minus twenty-one seconds but", "147:17", "who cares like if I had said ten to the", "147:19", "minus twenty-eight would that have", "147:20", "changed your opinion of the Higgs boson", "147:21", "in any way like it's a really short", "147:23", "period of time right like five could", "147:25", "really is that more than four trillion", "147:27", "doesn't really affect your life in any", "147:29", "meaningful way what is going on right", "147:33", "now with with science that is", "147:36", "particularly compelling to you other",

my life's work like I", "149:20", "was hoping for this to come online I'm", "149:22", "not gonna see what what else can I do", "149:23", "and he found that in biology there are", "149:28", "what is known as scaling laws so if you", "149:31", "look at different organisms like mammals", "149:33", "or whatever right you can plot different", "149:35", "quantities like their mass and their", "149:38", "metabolism or their lifespan things like", "149:40", "that and it turns out that they are", "149:42", "related to each other it's not you know", "149:44", "if you know how heavy a mammal is you", "149:46", "know how long it's gonna live you can", "149:48", "figure that out and in fact it's really", "149:51", "the metabolism also so there's a", "149:53", "wonderful so basically the bigger you", "149:55", "are the longer you live also the bigger", "149:57", "you are the slower your heart beats and", "150:00", "they exactly cancel out so that every", "150:03", "mammal lives for about one and a half", "150:04", "billion heartbeats on average I've read", "150:07", "that and I relate that to my friends", "150:10", "that are runners and I was like you got", "150:12", "to think of your an ultra marathon", "150:14", "runner like my friend Cameron Haines he", "150:16", "runs he's 240 mile runs was he just did", "150:21", "that in Death Valley and dad what I keep", "150:24", "making badass but it's like the bad", "150:26", "water", "150:27", "yeah 335 miles these races are crazy", "150:32", "you gotta think the exertion over long", "150:34", "periods you tell you're juicing up your", "150:36", "battery you don't get a finite number a", "150:38", "fixed number of heartbeats to begin with", "150:39", "but you know what they do do though it", "150:41", "lowers their resting heart rate yes so", "150:45", "all this extreme exercises are you're", "150:47", "wasting heartbeats but also your", "150:50", "heartbeat is probably like 78 whereas", "150:52", "theirs is 34 yeah now they're winning", "150:55", "overall yeah it totally compensates", "150:57", "weird right it's a weird sort of", "151:00", "intuitive thing it's the hundred the", "151:02", "billion and a half is just an average", "151:04", "but the point is so Geoffrey west and", "151:06", "his collaborators said why why is it", "151:09", "that you know you can't make an animal", "151:10", "that's twice as big and lives the same", "151:12", "law like yeah what's that what's going", "151:14", "on so they actually came up with a", "151:16", "theory based on the fact that our bodies", "151:18", "are networks right our circulatory", "151:21", "system or a respiratory system or a", "151:23", "nervous system and they all have the", "151:24", "same structure like trees right like", "151:26", "fractals and and they are able to show", "151:29", "that if our if the resources that our", "151:32", "biology uses travel through these", "151:35", "fractal networks in a three-dimensional", "151:37", "space right we're three dimensional", "151:39", "beings then you get these scaling laws", "151:42", "you get the this universal behavior and", "151:44", "it fits the data and now you know you", "151:47", "can extend it to the behavior of things", "151:49", "like cities and corporations and stuff", "151:52", "like that so when you get people in a", "151:54", "city they walk faster right like people", "151:58", "in little small towns mosey down the", "151:59", "street and everyone in the big city", "152:01", "walks faster and why is that like what's", "152:04", "going on and there's you would not be", "152:07", "surprised to learn that there are more", "152:09", "patents that are generated in a big city", "152:12", "than this small town but there are even", "152:14", "more patents per person in a big city", "152:17", "like living in that dense environment", "152:19", "changes the rate of innovation and", "152:22", "things like that so they're studying how", "152:24", "we can try to extract these not quite as", "152:29", "precise as particle physics but still", "152:31", "very general robust relationships", "152:34", "between these large systems and learn", "152:37", "from that how to make things more", "152:39", "sustainable more creative more", "152:40", "innovative more livable and things like", "152:43", "that so I think all the stuff is very", "152:44", "fascinating", "152:45", "they've actually done studies where", "152:46", "they've put cameras up on streets and", "152:49", "they watch people walk by and the amount", "152:52", "of footsteps they take per minute they", "152:54", "can accurately depict or they can", "152:57", "accurately predict how many people live", "153:00", "in that city I believe that that's Ain", "153:03", "yeah just based on half and also how", "153:05", "fast you talk yep how fast you talk how", "153:09", "fast the line moves in the DMV in the", "153:12", "host office in I think it's Dublin I'm", "153:15", "not exactly sure but but Geoffrey West", "153:17", "has this picture of Dublin there's this", "153:19", "tourist area and so it's both a big city", "153:22", "where a lot of people live but it's also", "153:23", "a famous tourist destination where", "153:25", "foreigners come in and wander around", "153:27", "right and the locals who live in a big", "153:29", "city and want to get where they want to", "153:31", "go became so frustrated with all these", "153:32", "moseying tourists they literally made", "153:35", "walking lanes for the locals where you", "153:37", "have to walk fast right you're not", "153:39", "allowed to meander oh wow that is", "153:41", "interesting that's interesting listen", "153:44", "thank you very much for doing this thank", "153:47", "you for being you thank you for this", "153:49", "podcast you're putting out the books", "153:50", "you're right it's so important for", "153:52", "people like me to have someone like you", "153:54", "that can sort of illuminate a lot of", "153:55", "these things and I really really", "153:57", "appreciate your time my pleasure thanks", "153:59", "for being a role model help inspiring me", "154:00", "here my pleasure", "154:01", "and mindscape podcast that's right it's", "154:04", "available now everywhere probably heard", "154:07", "hopefully yeah tried beautiful thank you", "154:09", "Sean Carroll ladies and gentlemen", "154:12", "[Music]",
