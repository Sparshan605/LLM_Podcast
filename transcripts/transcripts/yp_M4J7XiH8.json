good", "00:09", "shape like what's the big deal well I", "00:11", "went with Rinella when I went with", "00:12", "Ranaut one of the things I realized like", "00:14", "boy I got pretty winded going up these", "00:15", "fucking hills like hiking hiking tires", "00:17", "you out especially high altitude and", "00:19", "then I see your your videos online I was", "00:22", "like what fuck is this guy into and then", "00:24", "as I go deeper and deeper into I realize", "00:28", "like oh this is like an extreme pursuit", "00:31", "this is not just like something just go", "00:33", "out and do this is something that's", "00:35", "really hard to do and a lot of people", "00:37", "there I've read this one article but", "00:40", "this one guy was unsuccessful twelve", "00:42", "years in a row elk hunting yeah boy we", "00:44", "finally shot an elk yeah 12 years like", "00:47", "how many times this guy go out how many", "00:49", "days would be camp in the forest yeah", "00:51", "how many days you try to stalk and get", "00:53", "winded or snap on a twig at the last", "00:55", "minute or you know the elk season and", "00:58", "bolts it most people are unsuccessful", "01:00", "yeah I mean 9 out of 10 every year", "01:03", "unsuccessful I think it's more than that", "01:05", "for hunting with archery it it's about", "01:08", "it's about 10 percents is it 10 percent", "01:09", "yeah so 9 out of 10 are unsuccessful so", "01:13", "people who don't hunt who see you know", "01:16", "dead stuff all the time they think oh", "01:18", "you just go out and kill an atom right", "01:19", "no right most 90% don't it is really", "01:24", "hard and it's just like until you're out", "01:27", "there you got the bow in your hand and", "01:29", "you're trying to close in on that animal", "01:31", "and you're trying to do everything right", "01:32", "from A to Z with and there's so many", "01:35", "variables during that whole path it's", "01:39", "just like it seems impossible sometimes", "01:41", "you know even even for me after 30 years", "01:44", "so in a sense psychologically when you", "01:46", "talk about postmodernists and their", "01:48", "rejection of these classic male", "01:49", "structures or what they doing is", "01:51", "realizing that they're not going to", "01:53", "compete in the classic as stated male", "01:56", "hierarchy so they're creating their own", "01:58", "version of it sure that's the creative", "02:01", "element sure well we asked earlier", "02:03", "what's the motivation of these", "02:05", "pathological guys who are out there like", "02:07", "bolstering up the feminists yeah well", "02:10", "you know they don't compete any other", "02:12", "way they don't compete", "02:13", "they figured out how to compete they", "02:15", "compete as allies let's say hmm very", "02:18", "sneaky Wow", "02:20", "yeah Wow sneaky yeah and that's how", "02:23", "everybody always describes him too when", "02:25", "you I mean it's almost like that yeah we", "02:27", "I avoid doing it because I just it just", "02:29", "almost feels gross to label them like", "02:31", "that but that is the way you think of", "02:33", "male feminist you think of them as", "02:35", "sneaky yeah and yeah it's creepy and", "02:40", "discriminatory towards classic male", "02:43", "behavior well it no wonder yeah they", "02:46", "haven't got a hope of competing in that", "02:47", "hierarchy wow that's deep that is deep", "02:52", "this is going to be hurtful to a lot of", "02:56", "people it's not people listening to us", "02:58", "right now very upset yeah well you asked", "03:00", "earlier why why the postmodernists don't", "03:03", "like blunt speech yeah well that's why", "03:05", "man you know it's like the truth is", "03:08", "something that burns it burns off", "03:10", "Deadwood and people don't like having", "03:12", "their Deadwood burnt off often because", "03:14", "they're like 95% Deadwood and I'm not", "03:17", "being don't believe me I'm not being", "03:19", "snide about that", "03:20", "it's no joke when you start to realize", "03:23", "how much of what you've constructed of", "03:25", "yourself is based on deception and and", "03:27", "lies that is a horrifying realization", "03:29", "and it can easily be 95% of you your", "03:33", "things you say things you act out you", "03:36", "know it's well you see that in Pinocchio", "03:38", "which I often you discuss you know", "03:40", "Pinocchio when he gets corrupt as he as", "03:42", "he matures he first learns to lie and", "03:46", "then he becomes a braying jackass on", "03:48", "Pleasure Island it's like and and he's", "03:50", "threatened by the underground", "03:51", "authoritarians right they're going to", "03:53", "sell them to the salt mines like yeah", "03:54", "that's for sure it's exactly right man", "03:57", "so then you figure out you're a braying", "04:00", "jackass and you're lying all the time", "04:01", "that's a terrible realization and then", "04:04", "all that needs to be burnt away and no", "04:06", "people don't like that it ties into like", "04:09", "misconceptions that are natural like", "04:11", "funny thing like when I was in the video", "04:13", "game industry there's you know platform", "04:16", "games you jump from little platforms and", "04:18", "sometimes you have like platforms that", "04:19", "move around and rather than Mario type", "04:21", "things right in some video games when", "04:23", "you jump up on a moving platform and", "04:25", "then", "04:26", "jump down and fall down you will fall", "04:29", "down but the platform moves out from", "04:30", "underneath you", "04:31", "sometimes you jump up and you move with", "04:33", "the platform and you land on it depends", "04:35", "on what the programmer did right now a", "04:37", "friend of mine was doing a video game", "04:40", "and one of the programmers says like oh", "04:42", "if you jump up and then jump down the", "04:44", "platform should have moved out from", "04:45", "underneath you so you should be able to", "04:46", "like a you should be able to you know", "04:50", "this is the way we should program the", "04:51", "physics and then my friend map said no", "04:53", "that's wrong and he couldn't convince", "04:56", "this other guy so eventually what", "04:58", "happened he says right what we're going", "04:59", "to do is we're going to go out onto the", "05:01", "road with my pickup", "05:02", "my pickup truck I'm going to get in the", "05:04", "back and you're going to drive along at", "05:05", "30 miles an hour and I'm going to jump", "05:07", "straight up in the air and we're going", "05:09", "to see whether I land in the truck or I", "05:12", "land on the road so they did this", "05:14", "experiment I'm the guy the other guy was", "05:16", "driving the truck was totally expecting", "05:17", "him to like jump up and then fall out", "05:19", "the back of the truck because the truck", "05:20", "will moved on because he's moving the", "05:21", "same speed whereas the truck three jumps", "05:23", "up and then he lands back in the truck", "05:25", "right and this that this is illustrating", "05:28", "that this video game programmer had the", "05:30", "exact same misconception that the flat", "05:32", "earthers do because they say oh wait the", "05:34", "earth is moving so fast why can't you", "05:35", "just go up in a helicopter hover a bit", "05:37", "wait for the earth to move underneath", "05:39", "you and then go back down again right", "05:41", "it's just you know it's completely", "05:42", "backwards physics because you're already", "05:44", "moving so you have to slow down to zero", "05:47", "which is the same as speeding up and", "05:49", "relatively speaking so the point is that", "05:52", "anyone can make misconceptions about", "05:55", "physics like that yeah and it's easy to", "05:59", "get sucked into it and it's actually", "06:00", "quite hard to break them even like this", "06:02", "this reasonable guy was like in a video", "06:04", "game programmer who presumably knew", "06:05", "something about physics he was convinced", "06:07", "that Matt was going to fall out of the", "06:09", "back of the truck and quite possibly", "06:11", "dies but he still ended the experiment", "06:17", "[Applause]", "06:18", "[Music]", "06:19", "[Applause]", "06:22", "[Music]",
