and", "57:25", "that's because we are when we come out", "57:27", "as babies we are the most dependent", "57:30", "individuals so like our you know what I", "57:32", "mean like on your parents on your mother", "57:34", "we are completely socially dependent", "57:36", "when we're born completely and so you", "57:39", "know Abram as Laos hierarchy of needs", "57:41", "everything that it's like you know to be", "57:44", "okay you have to take care of breathing", "57:45", "and water and your basic functions but", "57:48", "there's there's been studies recently by", "57:50", "these neural

and there's literally a book", "58:03", "called social by a guy named Matthew", "58:05", "Lieberman like you got to check it out", "58:07", "and so what they are finding is that", "58:10", "there's like two parts of our operating", "58:13", "brain and this is you know going to be", "58:15", "me paring it down but one is the", "58:18", "analytical thinking deciding thing and", "58:21", "the other is this social awareness brain", "58:23", "which is always like always checking in", "58:26", "on how am I in relation to others and", "58:28", "it's also the part of the brain that", "58:30", "actually we could like the metacognitive", "58:32", "part in the part that I can they call it", "58:34", "mind-reading but really it's just it's", "58:36", "just by us sitting here I can kind of", "58:38", "get a sense of how you feel in what", "58:40", "you're thinking right just by the the", "58:42", "connection that we have and just it's", "58:44", "it's part of who we are", "58:45", "so when our analytical brain is offline", "58:47", "this other one the social one pops on", "58:49", "immediately so so what they're", "58:51", "theorizing is that that is like the", "58:55", "fundamental need for humans in safety", "58:58", "and survival is how are", "59:00", "we relating to each other as a group but", "59:03", "it makes sense if you look I mean to me", "59:05", "it makes sense in you know we are social", "59:08", "animals we forget that I think but you", "59:10", "look at other species of monkeys or", "59:13", "wolves or whatever I mean you know there", "59:16",

"59:25", "safe for us as humans and animals social", "59:29", "animals like these to be isolated it's", "59:31", "not and and so there's all these parts", "59:34", "of us that just if we're not connected", "59:36", "to other people in a in a very direct", "59:38", "and true way there's these sort of deep", "59:41", "down emotional and physiological fears", "59:46", "that come up right and then they're real", "59:48", "and that's what the neurobiology is", "59:50", "showing which it's really interesting", "59:52", "and we can just think about that but", "59:53", "they're actually showing it now that if", "59:55", "we're not really connected to each other", "59:57", "we're going to be freaked out we're not", "59:59", "going to be okay and you know I really", "60:02", "believe that this really drives a lot of", "60:04", "the internal struggle we have and we're", "60:07", "really and this is part of you know", "60:08", "getting into it that's part of my what", "60:10", "I'm trying to bring into the world and", "60:12", "my platform now is is just to you know", "60:15", "stand up and say hey we need each other", "60:18", "and we can do it it's not and for guys", "60:20", "specifically right it's such a social", "60:23", "stigma of ours to not be real or open or", "60:26", "connected or vulnerable with guys and", "60:28", "and it's it's cool to see the science",

really lighten it", "60:49", "up and yeah man lonely I mean we can all", "60:52", "think about a loneliness isn't fun it's", "60:54", "not doesn't feel good but the other this", "60:57", "is crazy too", "60:58", "that they're showing that emotional pain", "61:01", "lights up the same centers of our brain", "61:03", "it's physical pain and that one study", "61:07", "showed that an insult to someone had", "61:12", "much more painful and long-term effects", "61:14", "than slamming somebody with a hammer", "61:16", "hitting their hand with the hammer so", "61:18", "like our emotional pain literally", "61:20", "actually exists in the body like it is", "61:23", "actual pain and the reason that it's so", "61:27", "uncomfortable to feel our emotions which", "61:29", "it is you know I mean I'll just say it", "61:32", "is is that it actually hurts like", "61:35", "actually hurts I mean and there's like", "61:36", "people say things like you broke my", "61:38", "heart or I'm dying of heart ache or", "61:40", "whatever but that the science is", "61:42", "catching up and showing us that this", "61:43", "pain is actual it's real and we're not", "61:46", "addressing it we're not even aware of it", "61:48", "it's really enjoyable", "61:49", "that's deep you know it's interesting", "61:52", "too because what you're saying about us", "61:54", "being disconnected and how unhealthy it", "61:56", "is now on unhealthy loneliness is it", "61:58", "sort of confirms these ideas that I've", "62:00", "always had that the human race itself is", "62:03", "not like a group of individuals but a", "62:06", "superorganism", "62:07", "much like the human body is like the", "62:09", "human body look requires all the", "62:11", "bacteria and your gut all the skin flora", "62:14", "all the different things that compose", "62:16", "the actual physical structure of the", "62:18", "human body whereas we think of it I", "62:20", "think there's some nutty number of how", "62:23", "much bacteria how many bacterial cells", "62:25", "are in your body versus how many human", "62:28", "cells right as if our outnumbers the", "62:30", "human cells and it's just that we think", "62:33", "of ourselves as I Mike and I put my", "62:36", "shoes on and I go to work as I am Mike", "62:38", "and but Mike you're a system you're a", "62:41", "system of individual organisms that are", "62:43",

the new data 1 2 1", "63:47", "instead of toe so it's why are as much", "63:50", "okay so they used to say it was 10 to 1", "63:53", "but now it's 1 to 1 okay", "63:55", "wow that's still crazy man it's still", "63:58", "like you're half bacteria I like that", "64:00", "analogy though the body is is like a", "64:02", "civilization or what let me think about", "64:04", "if you're one of your I don't know one", "64:08", "important neuron one cell neural cell or", "64:11", "something decided just to go rogue and", "64:13", "not be in connection with the rest of", "64:14", "you right all right I don't that", "64:17", "wouldn't work so well right I don't know", "64:18", "I don't know what happened your body", "64:19", "would probably get rid of it and get it", "64:21", "out of there or I don't know maybe so", "64:25", "I'm just really reaching here but it's", "64:26", "some sort of rogue cell at that point", "64:29", "right like yeah answer a cell or", "64:30", "something I'd probably be attacked so", "64:33", "yeah if you I think that if you take", "64:36", "that analogy you know our civilization", "64:38", "hears we're hurtin mmm really hurting", "64:40", "because we're really not you know we are", "64:43", "working together obviously in practical", "64:45", "ways a lot of times you know work in", "64:47", "commerce and you know the world is", "64:49", "functioning but I think on a like a", "64:51", "health and fulfillment level we're", "64:53", "missing something pretty deeply yeah", "64:55", "well also like let's talk about people", "64:59", "that are disconnected

yeah", "66:24", "and it's it's that sense of connection", "66:26", "it's that real I think and I think that", "66:30", "is you know really apparent in your", "66:31", "podcast is that you yeah you sit here", "66:34", "and you really connect to somebody just", "66:35", "run with it and I think that's it's a", "66:38", "big it's a big thing man I mean I mean I", "66:41", "think of like so part of

we", "79:08", "tried to show is that if kids would do", "79:09", "something shitty to pay attention and", "79:12", "and that they would see the harm they're", "79:14", "creating themselves by career

some people would be kind of fucked", "79:58", "up and some people would be really", "80:00", "fucked up it's probably a spectrum right", "80:01", "oh absolutely generally speaking very", "80:04",

the family or an attack or an assault", "95:23", "or whatever whatever that trauma could", "95:26", "be that if you don't allow the body and", "95:31", "the your system to actually go through",

this it's not", "95:55", "just I mean it's still theory right but", "95:57", "it's so I feel like I got off what we", "96:01", "were talking about there but yeah I feel", "96:06", "like like you said being able to", "96:09", "overcome things of course absolutely and", "96:12", "part of that is just to me again", "96:15", "speaking more from a male perspective", "96:16", "here but part of that and I think a lot", "96:18", "of what our culture says is okay is", "96:21", "let's horse our way through this right", "96:24", "let's force a let's push harder let's", "96:26", "let's conquer our fears

that's the thing and", "96:37", "there's this other whole way to get", "96:40", "through hardship which is by actually", "96:42", "surrendering to it and letting you're in", "96:45", "this like brilliant system that we have", "96:47", "as humans to process it and get through", "96:49", "it right right and that's that's a way", "96:51", "to wholeness and health in some ways I", "96:54",

"getting hurt or whatever and then", "97:05", "there's this other part I think it needs", "97:06", "to be in balance which is accepting", "97:09", "what's happening and getting through I", "97:11", "yeah just a way to accept what's", "97:14", "happening and let your body do what", "97:16", "anything well also think there's an", "97:17", "extreme lack of discipline that a lot of", "97:20", "people have and that discipline a lot of", "97:23", "it comes from overcoming difficult", "97:25", "obstacles and understanding the work", "97:27", "that's required to get things done", "97:28",

"98:30", "lot of this life so yeah and that points", "98:33", "directly to what you know I do and what", "98:36", "I'm building is is that so you take", "98:38", "eight of those guys and you set up a", "98:39", "system you say alright in this space", "98:43", "right here fuck all that we're going to", "98:45", "be actually honest and say what we're", "98:47", "feeling but maybe can't even really", "98:50", "access so like all that frustration all", "98:52", "that shit or whatever it could be", "98:54", "anything that's so hard for people to do", "98:55", "right like what what kind of techniques", "98:57", "do you employ to get someone like say if", "99:00", "you got some guy who's closed off and", "99:02", "he's been bullshitting his way through", "99:03", "life and then all sudden here he is this", "99:05", "35 year old guy that's really troubled", "99:07", "it's in a room with you how do you get", "99:08", "that guy to open on safety and say I'm", "99:11", "leading by example and being vulnerable", "99:13", "by example and when somebody's it's part", "99:16", "of this connection like sitting down", "99:17", "with somebody that if you after one of", "99:19", "these last retreats that when the guys", "99:20", "came up to me said safety is the new", "99:22", "ayahuasca which is maybe a strange thing", "99:25", "to say but he said he'd been all over", "99:27", "the world doing drugs trying to find", "99:30", "growth trying to find himself and we", "99:33", "went went to this retreat and all we did", "99:35", "was sit down and say okay our intention", "99:38",

"at like like it's a safe space to do it", "99:49", "and then you just you dive in and lead", "99:52", "by example and that example like plugs", "99:54", "others right into it like it's this", "99:58", "amazing like symbiotic thing that", "99:59", "happens so right and and people just", "100:03", "sometimes break open sometimes crack", "100:06", "slowly open but you know all of a sudden", "100:09", "so maybe after 35 years of only being", "100:11", "other people's program you get in touch", "100:13", "with what you actually feel what you", "100:16", "actually want and who", "100:17",

keep you", "100:59", "not who you are right since I think you", "101:01", "know but so what we're finding which is", "101:03", "really amazing is that if you stay on", "101:05", "that surface level if you stay on that", "101:07", "sort of I don't know like so-so trying", "101:11", "to improve yourself", "101:12", "it goes so far but it's kind of like an", "101:16", "iceberg thing right so like if

I", "105:14", "thought the first thing I thought was", "105:16", "this is going to be fucking awful and so", "105:19", "I get it but yet I think we're getting", "105:23", "further enough along where the guys that", "105:26", "are going through this are literally", "105:28", "coming back with the most positive", "105:30", "feedback that I could I couldn't write", "105:32", "the shit like like changing their lives", "105:34", "and just like literally because it's you", "105:38", "know back to that thing we're offering a", "105:39", "place for them to accept a part of", "105:43", "themselves that's been offline for a", "105:45", "long time it's a big fucking deal", "105:46", "it's really yeah it's also probably also", "105:48", "a big fucking deal to just separate from", "105:51", "the high for a little bit and just be", "105:54", "outside of cellphone range and be in the", "105:56", "woods and just take a big deep breath of", "105:59", "fresh air and look around at the", "106:01", "wilderness and just realize that this is", "106:03", "this is reality as well and you've been", "106:05", "plugged into this civilization reality", "106:09", "this is this city this urban environment", "106:12", "which is entirely unnatural and has only", "106:16", "been a real thing for the past couple", "106:18", "hundred years we literally didn't exist", "106:20", "for the gigantic swath of humanity that", "106:24", "that existed before that yeah I think", "106:27", "that it waffles are the right word there", "106:28", "oh really I think it does a couple deep", "106:31", "things it lights up this this this", "106:35", "neurobiology that that of us has social", "106:37", "animals I think it goes back to more of", "106:41", "a tribal sense of living - it's not all", "106:43", "of a sudden you you went from being", "106:45", "isolated and lonely to heaven 30 dudes", "106:47", "who would honestly fucking do anything", "106:49", "for you in that moment", "106:50", "then I got a buddy a good buddy as a", "106:54", "returned Special Forces", "106:56", "operator and he sits in my men's group", "106:58", "in Bozeman with me and really struggled", "107:01", "with coming home and then found our", "107:04", "group and within a month his life was", "107:06", "back on track", "107:07", "like just killing it man just like", "107:09", "kicking ass and you know I mean there is", "107:12", "a connection between and I wouldn't say", "107:14", "the general military but the Special", "107:16", "Forces you know you read books and hear", "107:18", "about the aspect of Brotherhood and how", "107:20", "they're there for each other you know", "107:22", "this is definitely a very different", "107:24", "venue but the I think the bond and", "107:26", "connection that that is created out of", "107:27", "it is and this is you know from from his", "107:31", "mouth to is it's he went you know I", "107:36", "don't know how many years several years", "107:37", "in the Special Forces living within", "107:39", "close connection to guys got thrown home", "107:42", "was all son isolated and they came into", "107:44", "our group and just had this this uh", "107:47", "closeness again and it just BAM just", "107:50", "like back to back to killing it Wow yeah", "107:54", "yeah it's it's I mean I very aware I", "107:57", "mean it's I've been scared to start", "108:00", "speaking about this for years man I mean", "108:02", "it's very uh to me even I look at", "108:06", "advertising for similar man's program", "108:08", "something like that it just so turned", "108:09", "off right it seems weird it doesn't", "108:12", "think people need resets he needs some", "108:14", "sort of reason and we've talked about", "108:16", "this before about we've both experienced", "108:18", "those resets through psychedelics yeah", "108:20", "or or through these awning trips you", "108:22", "know in these wilderness trips like but", "108:24", "I think people get caught up in the", "108:26", "momentum of their daily existence and", "108:29", "all the requirements of that daily", "108:31", "existence and they become overwhelming", "108:32", "you know like we were talking about like", "108:34", "though your lease that you have on your", "108:36", "car or your mortgage that you have in", "108:38", "your house and the credit card bills", "108:39", "that keep coming in your student loans", "108:41", "you need to eventually get to blah it's", "108:43", "a fucking overwhelming grind yeah and", "108:46", "sometimes people need something that", "108:49", "removes them entirely from it for a", "108:51", "certain amount of time that allows you", "108:53", "just the fresh air not not just literal", "108:57", "flesh air but the metaphorical fresh air", "108:59", "of all allowing you to just separate", "109:02", "from the all these weird influences and", "109:05", "all this weird energy and momentum the", "109:08", "momentum of you the life", "109:09", "you've created or that's been created", "109:11", "for you that you're sort of trapped in", "109:12", "yeah yeah man I'm I'd fit so that reset", "109:17", "thing I mean I I think I want a warning", "109:21", "is that if you start getting a reset and", "109:23", "I mean from my own experience I need it", "109:25", "pretty regularly you know so the", "109:27", "actually the biggest goal of this", "109:30", "everyman the organization I founded is", "109:33", "to our goal is to get a million guys in", "109:36", "man's groups because that is the same", "109:39", "and it happens so this last retreat had", "109:41", "30 guys show up about 20 of them wanted", "109:45", "to immediately get into a weekly group", "109:47", "to to basically continually and", "109:50", "regularly experience the same thing it's", "109:52", "like a hit you know there's a thing too", "109:54", "about men in this culture where there's", "109:57", "not a lot of sympathy towards men that", "109:59", "are struggling it seems like there's", "110:01", "this thought that men are the patriarchy", "110:03", "and we're dominating the world and we're", "110:06", "almost like subhuman we're responsible", "110:08", "for all these issues so men with issues", "110:10", "like Oh cry me a fucking River what", "110:12", "about women with issues what about trans", "110:14", "people with issues what about gay people", "110:16", "with issues what about black oh Jesus", "110:18", "Christ", "110:19", "like a regular white guy with issues", "110:21", "like your issues are bullshit okay but", "110:23", "it doesn't matter you are you are you", "110:25", "can't change the fact you're a white guy", "110:27", "so if you're a white guy with problems", "110:29", "nobody gives a fuck can't they see that", "110:31", "it all connects though no they don't see", "110:33", "that on they don't why cuz I makes", "110:35", "everybody else unhappy to what talk man", "110:37", "they don't because it's not convenient", "110:39", "for their narrative the narratives that", "110:41", "you're responsible for all the problems", "110:42", "in the world even though you're just Dan", "110:44", "Doty from Bozeman Montana yeah no I get", "110:47", "it but it's it's so I mean that's one of", "110:49", "the most powerful so the podcast that", "110:51", "I'm launching is a self-improvement", "110:54", "podcast for guys but instead of going to", "110:57", "experts and saying hey you know what's", "111:00", "the best morning routine that you can do", "111:02", "designing a routine or whatever I'm", "111:04", "talking to regular guys and asking them", "111:07", "to share you know more vulnerable than", "111:10", "they would normally would because that's", "111:12", "what happens in these scenarios is that", "111:13", "we learn from each other just as simple", "111:15", "human fucking beings just like you know", "111:18", "like one guy might share that he's", "111:19", "having trouble with his son for example", "111:22", "with his kid he doesn't not", "111:23", "it and you know like no matter what I", "111:27", "don't care like a bunch of other guys", "111:29", "will say like holy shit I thought I was", "111:33", "the only one feeling right you know and", "111:34", "it's just all of a sudden you and it's", "111:36", "back this isolation thing you think that", "111:38", "you're well think we're fucking special", "111:40", "right we all think that we're so unique", "111:42", "and the actual if we actually took the", "111:44", "time to connect with one another", "111:46", "we'd be like oh wow we have a lot like", "111:49", "and just that just that is enough to", "111:53", "drastically change somebody's day and", "111:57", "what's motivating you to venture off", "111:59", "because you were working for 0.08 and", "112:02", "make ya meat-eater and Anthony", "112:05", "Bourdain's show and all these different", "112:06", "shows what's motivating you to step away", "112:09", "from that and start doing
