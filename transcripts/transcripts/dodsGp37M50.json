tell", "00:15", "people before we get started I did not", "00:17", "know when I asked you to come back on", "00:19", "that you were heavily involved in this", "00:21", "whole vaccine debate what I wanted to", "00:23", "have you on to talk about is tropical", "00:25", "diseases because I remember when we did", "00:28", "that sci-fi show you explained to me", "00:30", "that some ungodly

diseases of poverty the", "00:48", "vaccine issue the the advocacy issue", "00:52", "around vaccines and autism is kind of a", "00:54", "new thing that I got drawn into just", "00:56", "because I'm a parent of an adult", "00:59", "daughter with autism and I make vaccines", "01:01", "so it was a natural that I'd get drawn", "01:03", "into it yeah so when I said that you're", "01:06", "gonna come on then I got inundated by", "01:08", "people that are you know the vaccine", "01:11", "thing is such a polarizing issue yeah", "01:15", "that's awful and so many people seem to", "01:17", "think they absolutely know what causes", "01:21", "what especially when it comes to", "01:23", "something like autism which is it's a", "01:27", "huge issue in this country it's a huge", "01:28", "issue around the world and it doesn't", "01:30", "didn't used to seem to be the question", "01:32", "is was that because it was undiagnosed", "01:35", "was that because it just there's it's", "01:38", "more

we used to call", "02:25", "pejorative things like mental", "02:27", "retardation now get thrown into the", "02:29", "autism category the other thing that you", "02:32", "absolutely know so well you know now we", "02:35", "call it as part of the autism spectrum", "02:38", "we also because autism often has a lot", "02:40", "of Associated intellectual disabilities", "02:43", "not always but sometimes the other is", "02:46", "that I posit is that based on aptitude", "02:51", "tests like how do you how do they decide", "02:53", "what sought is yes they they have a list", "02:56", "of

"03:48", "daughter it's not so much for autism", "03:50", "that thoughts her you know ability to", "03:54", "have partners or to have a meaningful", "03:58", "career it's the fact that she has",

yeah absolutely", "04:55", "but so there's no there's it's not like", "04:59", "you could test positive for syphilis or", "05:01", "you can test positive for the flu right", "05:03", "although now you know as I say you know", "05:05", "so that's why I don't like using those", "05:07", "those terms because it it puts people on", "05:12", "the autism spectrum as though they have", "05:13", "a disease right or which I don't like to", "05:15", "do but if it is a disorder well you know", "05:18", "now we know there are 99 genes that are", "05:21", "linked to autism but why is it a bad", "05:23",

have", "05:54", "an issue there is an issue to say", "05:56", "there's no issue is kind of ridiculous", "05:57", "it's I mean there's a reason why so many", "06:00", "people are so concerned about

"development is it possible that some", "07:26", "people have this tendency towards autism", "07:29", "and it's exacerbated by vaccines I don't", "07:31", "think so um I think what what happens is",

on 18", "08:16", "months of age or 15 months of age you", "08:18", "want to link the two but now you can go", "08:20", "back to 6 months of age and as a studies", "08:23", "done at the University of

"08:41", "we can go into detail in the paper but", "08:43", "they can see certain things on", "08:44", "signatures on MRI that tell them that", "08:46", "this kid is going to", "08:48", "to develop okay so in fact there is a", "08:51", "way to test positive for autism done", "08:52", "with this serial MRI that's what they", "08:54", "think right that's me and now we have", "08:56", "the 99 gene

"yeah of course so so there is a way to", "09:19", "show whether children will be more", "09:21", "likely to develop autism and there's", "09:23", "there is a way to look at their brain", "09:25", "through fMRI at a very early age and and", "09:29", "also do the muscle do genetic sequence", "09:31", "so it's not simply a matter of how they", "09:34", "perform on cognitive tests that's right", "09:36", "that's right we're getting much better", "09:37", "at getting arms around the diagnosis why", "09:40", "do you think there's so many people that", "09:41", "have these anecdotal stories of their", "09:43", "child getting vaccinated especially", "09:46", "large doses of vaccines when they hit", "09:48", "them off like ten in a row and then all", "09:50", "of a sudden or meters measles

heard it", "09:59", "from friends from friends that have", "10:01", "children that have autism they had a", "10:02", "child their child got the measles mumps", "10:04", "rubella shot and then immediately there", "10:07", "was a very distinct change in the", "10:08", "child's behavior well no question when", "10:10", "you get the measles mumps rubella", "10:11", "vaccine many times kids cry and things", "10:14", "like that and then autism will then", "10:17", "begin sometime between the first and", "10:18", "second year of life so it's logical to", "10:21", "want to connect the two but now we know", "10:23", "it's not even plausible because we know", "10:25", "that if you go back to that MRI at 6", "10:27", "months of age or go back prenatally we", "10:30", "can even determine which kids are going", "10:32", "to go out to develop autism so even", "10:34", "though this and that complementing it", "10:36", "complementing it our massive", "10:38", "epidemiologic studies done on over 1", "10:40", "million kids that in fact a new paper", "10:42", "was just released this week showing that", "10:45", "kids who get the EMR get the MMR vaccine", "10:49", "are no more likely to get autism than", "10:52", "kids who don't who don't get the MMR", "10:54", "vaccine and the conduct converse is also", "10:56", "true kids on the autism spectrum are no", "10:59", "more of likely to have gotten the Emma", "11:01", "vaccine the kids not on the autism", "11:03", "spectrum okay so so it's the combination", "11:05", "of that those big studies of over 1", "11:08", "million kids together with knowing what", "11:11", "autism is that completely rules out the", "11:13", "possibility right so these genes excuse", "11:16", "me the end the issue with these genes", "11:18", "and then the ability to scan the brain", "11:22", "with the serial MRI and so you can tell", "11:25", "which children have the propensity is it", "11:28", "possible that children have all these", "11:30", "issues and then do not get autism or do", "11:33", "100 percent of those children with those", "11:35", "issues get autism that's a good question", "11:37", "I don't know I'm a vaccine scientist so", "11:39", "I'm you know the not about the well well", "11:42", "I'm a biologist problem of vaccine", "11:43", "scientist who's really tried to do a", "11:46", "deep dive on autism", "11:47", "doing research on the book versus human", "11:49", "development right right okay so so what", "11:53", "you're saying though is that if a child", "11:55", "does not have these mutations and does", "11:57", "not have these issues that are present", "11:59", "and during a serial MRI that they will", "12:02", "not go on to develop autism is that true", "12:04", "as far as we can't as far as we can tell", "12:06", "so children without those issues who get", "12:11", "vaccinated have have no problems which", "12:13", "most children have no problems right", "12:15", "yeah I mean the you know we've learned a", "12:18", "lot about the the risk of vaccines and", "12:21", "the numbers are extraordinary I mean the", "12:24", "risk of a severe adverse event happening", "12:27", "after getting a vaccine is roughly on", "12:30", "the order of one in a million between", "12:31", "between one and a million and one in ten", "12:33", "million so and I found an Internet", "12:37", "report wants as a delight likelihood of", "12:39", "getting struck by lightning is 1 in", "12:41", "700,000 so it's you know the like having", "12:44", "a severe event after a vaccine is your", "12:46", "bet ads are better of getting struck by", "12:49", "lightning then and when you say severe", "12:51", "event what do you mean by severe event", "12:53", "though oh well there's actually a table", "12:55", "that's put out by the National Vaccine", "12:59", "Compensation Act", "13:01", "includes shoulder injury", "13:04", "that's one encephalitis a shoulder", "13:08", "injury yeah that's actually and from the", "13:10", "actual injection you put getting", "13:11", "injecting it in the wrong place", "13:13", "oh so it goes into the joint or", "13:15", "something like that yeah yeah", "13:16", "is that common no no so there there have", "13:21", "been issues where children have adverse", "13:23", "effects and reactions to vaccines what", "13:26", "do you attribute those to but one you", "13:28", "know one in a million I think you know", "13:30", "in some case biological variability I", "13:32", "think in some cases in terton Lee if", "13:34", "it's a live virus vaccine like the", "13:36", "measles mumps rubella vaccine and you", "13:38", "have an underlying immune deficiency", "13:39", "that wasn't picked up before then that", "13:42", "virus can replicate better but very rare", "13:44", "things like that right so as far as you", "13:48", "know children who are healthy who get a", "13:52", "vaccine is it's not biologically", "13:55", "possible for them to develop these", "13:57", "traits these mutations in the genes and", "13:59", "these issues that you see present as", "14:01", "best we can tell right now that seems to", "14:03", "be the case right as best you can tell", "14:06", "right now is a it's a great thing to say", "14:08", "right but for people that are like hmm", "14:12", "on the outside like what does that mean", "14:13", "I'm not a doctor I'm not smart enough to", "14:15", "understand what doctor Hotez is saying", "14:17", "right yeah what does he say well we can", "14:20", "tell can we tell so here's what we can", "14:22", "tell okay no studies and over 1 million", "14:26", "children that there's no link between", "14:28", "vaccines and autism that's number one", "14:30", "and and so let me let me parse this I", "14:33", "hope you've been to bits so there's", "14:36", "there's the studies on a 1 million", "14:37", "children showing that vaccines do not", "14:39", "cause autism that's part one the second", "14:41", "is that and then I'll do a deeper dive", "14:44", "on each of them the second part shows", "14:46", "not only is there massive evidence that", "14:48", "there's no link between vaccines and", "14:50", "autism", "14:50", "there's no plausibility because we know", "14:53", "so much about autism how it begins in", "14:55", "pregnancy incorrectly so let's go back", "14:57", "to the first part the first part is", "14:59", "studies and over 1 million children one", "15:00", "of the things that the anti vaccine", "15:02", "Lobby does is they played this game on", "15:04", "what I want - not really a game but what", "15:06", "they quote what they do is play this", "15:07", "kind of thing of vaccine whack-a-mole", "15:10", "because at first they alleged it was the", "15:12", "MMR vaccine", "15:14", "and now came out out of the study that", "15:16", "was published in The Lancet in 1998 then", "15:18", "another group came along and said no no", "15:20", "we didn't mean the MMR vaccine we meant", "15:22", "the thimerosal", "15:23", "preservative that used to be in vaccine", "15:26", "and the scientific community not only", "15:28", "dum AA dee bunked the MMR linked they", "15:30", "debunked the thimerosal Ling then the", "15:33", "anti vaccine lobby came along and said", "15:35", "no no we didn't mean that we're spacing", "15:36", "vaccines too close together then they", "15:39", "changed to get round again saying now", "15:41", "it's the Ala more aluminum in vaccines", "15:43", "so and then each time the scientific", "15:45", "community responds with massive", "15:47", "epidemiologic study showed there's", "15:49", "absolutely none of those things are true", "15:51", "and do you think that it's just when you", "15:54", "look at say if there's one in a million", "15:57", "that has an issue with this and there's", "16:00", "and that's not autism so whatever", "16:02", "whatever those issues are that they hear", "16:06", "these stories and these stories do", "16:07", "accumulate because there's 300 plus", "16:09", "million people in this country and over", "16:11", "10 20 years of 1 million you develop a", "16:15", "significant history of cases where", "16:18", "children did have issues with vaccines", "16:21", "so these people hear about these stories", "16:24", "and people are terrified obviously", "16:26", "you're I have children you become very", "16:29", "overprotective of your children you", "16:31", "worry a lot right and then you also", "16:33", "don't know like why do they get so many", "16:35", "shots all in a row like that why does a", "16:37", "baby get ten shots in a day that seems", "16:39", "crazy", "16:40", "well they don't get ten shots in a day", "16:41", "most of the vaccines are now combined so", "16:44", "for instance in one vaccine we can", "16:47", "vaccinate against diphtheria pertussis", "16:49", "tetanus polio Hamas influenza type B", "16:56", "which is a terrible cause of of", "16:58", "meningitis and in some cases not even",

that's it that totally makes", "62:26", "sense because for the longest time was", "62:28", "there was that stereotype and then when", "62:30", "you find out that it's directly", "62:32", "connected to

unknown", "67:00", "hmm but isn't it bizarre the same people", "67:04", "got Lyme disease first and then how", "67:06", "about these host of issues afterwards", "67:07", "well the I guess part of the

"76:40", "about diseases of poverty and this is", "76:43", "one of the striking things about when I", "76:45", "wrote the book was you know I've had a", "76:47", "lot of success getting people to

toxic or Isis", "77:45", "is one of them another one is Jacques", "77:46", "disease and and the list goes on it's", "77:49", "been very hard to get people to care", "77:51", "about the poor in this

but we don't do", "78:00", "anything about these terrible", "78:01", "communities that have been terrible in", "78:03", "this country for a decade upon decade", "78:05", "right and so I try to make

bottom segment of", "78:25", "society and so I don't care where you", "78:27", "show me poverty whether it's in Texas or", "78:30", "Alabama or Nigeria or Bangladesh I will", "78:34", "show you these poverty related diseases", "78:36", "and you know I I know what's your name", "78:40", "AOC the congresswoman from New York has", "78:43", "talked a little bit about hookworm in", "78:45", "Alabama so last time I was in Washington", "78:47", "I dropped off a copy of the book in her", "78:49", "office but no response yet well she's", "78:51", "probably pretty busy too yeah she's", "78:53", "doing a lot of others if you had a magic", "78:54", "wand and someone said you could do", "78:58", "whatever you want to fix this what would", "79:00", "you do so I I did meet with a couple of", "79:04", "people on the hill and and they asked me", "79:06", "that question what's the magic wand and", "79:09", "there's a couple of things one we need", "79:11", "to actually look for these diseases", "79:13", "because the problem is they're the the", "79:16", "disease that caused a very subtle like", "79:17", "developmental delays", "79:19", "so that if you're you know a kid who", "79:21", "lives in poverty with developmental", "79:23", "delays the pediatrician doesn't even", "79:25", "think to do a test for toxic arises so", "79:28", "that so we need to raise awareness we", "79:30", "need to go into poor communities across", "79:33", "the country and actually take a blood", "79:35", "test and actually measure for the", "79:37", "presence of that disease or that", "79:39", "parasite once you find that disease what", "79:42", "would you do that well it depends on the", "79:43", "disease in some cases we have treatments", "79:45", "for him like the treatment for toxic", "79:47", "rias's is a five day course of a simple", "79:50", "pill of albendazole and it cures it and", "79:52", "it cures it so really yeah so that we", "79:54", "have you know we have interventions so", "79:57", "one you know doing what I call active", "79:59", "surveillance looking for these diseases", "80:01", "the other one is really trying to", "80:04", "understand how these diseases are", "80:06", "transmitted what is it about poor", "80:08", "neighborhoods that is facilitating", "80:10", "transmission I think the third problem", "80:12", "is the diagnostic test themselves", "80:14", "because they're very complicated tests", "80:16", "sometimes you know they're done at the", "80:18", "Centers for Disease Control and", "80:19", "Prevention our lab or our National", "80:23", "School of Tropical Medicine does a few", "80:24", "of them but it's not like you know when", "80:26", "you go for a you go for blood work and", "80:28", "your doctor and you get a little lab", "80:30", "slip from quest Diagnostics with the you", "80:32", "know the blood chemistry's the blood", "80:34", "counts there's no box there for toxic", "80:37", "Rises and Jacques to see so we need more", "80:39", "improved test point of care diagnostic", "80:42", "tests not just improved tests but just", "80:44", "let me make it more accessible yeah and", "80:47", "so they don't have to send it off to the", "80:49", "CDC or to you know our National School", "80:51", "of Tropical Medicine is their treatment", "80:53", "for talk so there is a treatment for", "80:55", "toxoplasmosis what is it", "80:58", "it's parama that means sulfa drug but it", "81:01", "requires a long treatment course how", "81:03", "long I'd have to look up the number of", "81:05", "days I haven't treated a patient with", "81:07", "toxoplasmosis in a while but and it", "81:10", "kills it effectively he can yeah really", "81:13", "yeah oh I thought it was something you", "81:14", "kept for life well if you don't get", "81:15", "treated right okay so and then if your", "81:18", "immune compromised and it comes back", "81:20", "then that that's a problem as well so", "81:23", "most people that have it really don't", "81:25", "even know they have that's right yeah", "81:27", "and actually and most people who have", "81:28", "neglected tropical diseases don't know", "81:30", "they have it either", "81:31", "so that in the end Texas for instance we", "81:33", "have transmission of a parasitic disease", "81:35", "called Jacques disease it's a cause of", "81:37", "heart disease we you know are members of", "81:42", "our faculty were actually able to track", "81:45", "down individuals who had donated blood", "81:48", "and the Gulf Coast Regional blood", "81:50", "authority actually found somebody people", "81:54", "positive for Jacques disease they were", "81:56", "told to go see their primary health care", "81:58", "provider and then unfortunately the", "82:01", "primary health care provider is not", "82:02", "educated about these diseases and they", "82:04", "just assume must be a false positive so", "82:06", "you know our faculty had tracked them", "82:08", "down and were able to get them into", "82:10", "treatment and what is the treatment for", "82:11", "Chagas it's a it's a an anti-parasitic", "82:14", "agent called Benson it is all and that", "82:17", "kills it that can kill if you catch it", "82:18", "early enough but sometimes you don't", "82:20", "catch it early so if it becomes systemic", "82:21", "then you have then that's why we're", "82:23", "trying to develop a therapeutic vaccine", "82:25", "for this disease oh but again it's a", "82:27", "therapeutic vaccine for a", "82:28", "poverty-related disease so it's it's", "82:30", "very tough ma'am so the point is these", "82:33", "diseases are widespread among the poor", "82:35", "and we just don't pay attention to them", "82:37", "yeah that's great and so I think you", "82:40", "know again I'd love to hear your", "82:42", "thoughts I mean what is it that we just", "82:45", "turn our backs on the poor in this", "82:47", "country it's it's disturbing it's very", "82:50", "dismissive value and and and they", "82:52", "disproportionately affect people of", "82:54", "color as well right yeah because you", "82:56", "know because it's so linked to poverty", "82:58", "well also right slavery yeah I mean the", "83:02", "history of slavery in this country in", "83:03", "the history of systemic racism in places", "83:06", "where they just literally would not sell", "83:08", "homes to people who are

thought I thought I", "83:47", "knew what poverty looked like I moved", "83:49", "down to the Gulf Coast it's a different", "83:51", "animal I mean the the depth and breadth", "83:53", "of poverty in the Gulf Coast in the", "83:55", "southern part of the United States is", "83:56", "just extraordinary and it's been very", "83:59", "hard to get people to want to really", "84:03", "take it on and really address these", "84:05", "these poverty related diseases do you", "84:07", "think what do you think the cause of it", "84:09", "is I mean if you've you've studied this", "84:11", "for quite a while well the cause of did", "84:14", "neglect yes yeah I don't know I don't", "84:17", "know you know is it something about", "84:19", "American exceptionalism or something", "84:22", "like we just don't want to admit we have", "84:23", "poor people I don't know you know I", "84:26", "wasn't the first to come up you know to", "84:28", "raise this issue about poverty when I", "84:30", "was in

Michael", "85:15", "Harrington yeah that is a very strange", "85:19", "thing our acceptance of these", "85:22", "communities and I mean I've always said", "85:25", "that if you want to make America a", "85:26", "better place the best thing to do is not", "85:31", "invade other countries or intervene the", "85:34", "best thing to do is try to rebuild these", "85:37", "impoverished communities

again this is not a topic that", "86:44", "is very popular I mean when when you see", "86:46", "presidential debates this is not", "86:49", "something common Oh buddy talks about it", "86:51", "and again even for disease I mean who", "86:52", "what are the diseases we hear about", "86:54", "Ebola and and lot of diseases like that", "86:58", "and sometimes on my frustration I say", "87:01", "you know where these are imaginary", "87:03", "diseases and yet here we've got", "87:05", "widespread diseases of the poor in the", "87:07", "US and the lights go out you remember", "87:09", "when that

"just thought it was so cruel is it just", "87:32", "ignorant of how handsome it is right how", "87:35", "its transmitted well actually Ebola you", "87:37", "know it turns out is the opposite of", "87:39", "measles measles one of those contagious", "87:41", "disease is known it has a reproductive", "87:43", "number of 12 to 18 what that means if a", "87:46", "single individual gets measles 12 to 18", "87:49", "others get it because the virus hangs", "87:51", "around in the environment and it's so", "87:53", "easily transmissible hangs around like", "87:55", "if you touch this tables right that's", "87:57", "right or even in the Aven and the", "87:58", "atmosphere so and that's why you get", "88:01", "these really large measles outbreaks", "88:03", "like you're seeing in Washington

the Ebola is just the opposite", "88:17", "Ebola is a reproductive number of two or", "88:19", "three so unless you're taking care of a", "88:22", "dead or dying Ebola patient or someone", "88:24",

vaccinate everybody", "88:50", "and how is it transmitted Ebola by", "88:55", "contact with fluids of somebody with", "88:56", "with Ebola so it has to get into your", "88:59", "tissue so right now oh what else should", "89:03", "we worry about you're freaking me out", "89:06", "the point is a lot of these diseases are", "89:09", "solvable if if we just put our mind to", "89:12", "it so are these or even aware of it one", "89:14", "of the things I say in the book is if", "89:16", "because these diseases are so widespread", "89:18", "among the poor in the g20 countries if", "89:20", "we could get the elected or the leaders", "89:24", "of those g20 countries together to g20", "89:26", "summit and say we're really going to do", "89:28", "something about the neglected diseases", "89:30", "in

because this is something I've", "89:50", "thought about many times but I didn't", "89:52", "know about cha God and know about a lot", "89:54", "of these a disease you're describing", "89:56", "yeah no I mean so we need to raise", "89:59", "awareness about these that's why I'm so", "90:00", "thrilled so thrilled to come here", "90:02", "because I've just amplified the number", "90:04", "of people

a funding", "90:25", "issue or is it at first before that an", "90:28", "education issue well I think there's", "90:31", "multiple issues so I mean if again with", "90:33", "the the drivers we've been

there are certain", "90:46", "things we can do aggressive unchecked", "90:48", "urbanization but the other things that", "90:51", "you can do is build better tools by", "90:55", "vitami better

you got to know about it first I", "91:51", "mean most what percentage of the", "91:54", "population even knows about right all", "91:56", "these parasite created diseases or know", "92:01", "that vaccines don't cause autism", "92:02", "yeah well that one is it that that's the", "92:05", "biggest one yeah I mean that's a tough", "92:07", "one and again I don't understand it I", "92:10", "mean I'm just saying it I'm saying", "92:12", "vaccines don't cause autism because", "92:14", "you're saying it right you know and then", "92:15", "I think this is the part of the boat is", "92:17", "a lot of peope are the problem we're in", "92:20", "this boat a bunch of people who are", "92:21", "scientifically illiterate like myself", "92:23", "we're discussing these issues who don't", "92:25", "really know what they're talking about", "92:26", "someone talked about tetanus because", "92:29", "some boy", "92:30", "had tetanus hmm and he was in the", "92:34", "hospital for a long time and his his", "92:36", "bill was hospital bills like a million", "92:38", "dollars good yeah yeah well because it's", "92:40", "an ICU admission right right and they", "92:42", "were saying hey you know why didn't this", "92:43", "kid get a tetanus shot and it get it", "92:46", "goes back to the same thing right that", "92:48", "people don't want these vaccines yeah", "92:50", "any prevented and again I don't blame", "92:52", "the parents I think the parents in some", "92:54", "ways are victims themselves our victim", "92:56", "of this very aggressive misinformation", "92:58", "right I mean that's out there tetanus is", "93:00", "a big one though isn't it yeah tetanus", "93:02", "and we have a vaccine for it that's part", "93:03", "of the what's called the DPT that's what", "93:05", "are the first vaccines you get as an", "93:07", "infant there's no excuse for having a", "93:09", "tetanus case in the United States right", "93:11", "and this kid was unvaccinated right yeah", "93:13", "that's my understanding", "93:14", "yeah I mean is there a cure for tetanus", "93:16", "outside of vaccines well I mean there", "93:20", "are supportive measures that you can do", "93:22", "but you know they require", "93:24", "hospitalization ventilation putting on a", "93:27", "respirator means it's a band you could", "93:30", "still die so it's a it's an awful awful", "93:32", "disease I've seen tetanus working in", "93:34", "Central America and elsewhere you see a", "93:36", "case of tetanus you never forget it", "93:38", "what is tightness technically well the", "93:40", "other name is lockjaw where your muscles", "93:42", "go into spasm and and you can including", "93:46", "the muscles involved in breathing so you", "93:48", "can't even breathe as a result of an", "93:50", "impairment it freezes the muscles what", "93:52", "what is doing it what's doing is it's", "93:55", "parris it's actually a caused by a", "93:57", "bacteria the bacteria releases a toxin", "93:59", "called tetanus toxin oh that's sounds", "94:03", "like a horrible way to go it's a", "94:04", "terribly sorrowful diseases and I think", "94:06", "one of the things that the NT vaccine", "94:09", "group or Lobby as I call it does is they", "94:11", "try to be very dismissive of these", "94:13", "diseases they try to deliberately", "94:16", "downplay the effects I mean you'll see", "94:18", "this stuff on the web measles build your", "94:21", "immune system yeah you said it yourself", "94:24", "so I didn't read it yeah I just saw it", "94:28", "yeah it's crap right yeah and what are", "94:32", "they saying what is what is the first", "94:34", "thing it's just a rash it builds your", "94:36", "immune system it makes you stronger it's", "94:38", "it's it's something out of", "94:42", "a different planet I don't know where", "94:43", "their Co we do though I think the reason", "94:45", "for that becoming popular is because you", "94:48", "we do kind of helicopter parent our kids", "94:51", "a little bit too much they should come", "94:52", "in contact with a bunch of different", "94:53", "things because it does build their", "94:54", "immune system correct", "94:56", "well that's an interesting hypothesis", "94:58", "called the hygiene hypothesis that says", "95:00", "you know a few kids are living in too", "95:03", "sterile environment then this can also", "95:07", "result in autoimmune diseases and things", "95:09", "like that but it's allergies allergies", "95:11", "and I have mixed feelings about the", "95:14", "hypothesis to me it's not not airtight", "95:16", "by any means yeah you're tight but it's", "95:18", "there's there's some sort of a", "95:19", "correlation particularly between peanut", "95:21", "allergies and keeping peanuts away from", "95:23", "children and that there was a study", "95:25", "showing those Jonathan hates work in one", "95:28", "of his books talked about how there was", "95:30", "a study done in communities where they", "95:32", "didn't protect kids from peanut", "95:35", "allergies and this much smaller", "95:36", "percentage of people developing peanut", "95:38", "allergies versus kids that they did yeah", "95:40", "well this is also one of the things that", "95:43", "the into vaccine lobbies doing now that", "95:45", "they're you know and when I write a book", "95:47", "like this vaccines don't cause autism", "95:48", "now what you're seeing remember I told", "95:50", "you about that whack-a-mole business", "95:52", "where they went from MMR tooth is all to", "95:56", "spacing vaccines too close together to", "95:58", "aluminum now there's some groups that", "95:59", "are moving away from autism altogether", "96:01", "and now they're saying well vaccines", "96:03", "cause autoimmune disease or vaccines", "96:05", "cause other neurologic deficits but it's", "96:09", "all it's all flim-flam it's all from", "96:11", "what is but there are there are vaccine", "96:14", "courts though right in vaccine there are", "96:16", "vaccine courts and they have handed out", "96:18", "payments to people who were injured by", "96:21", "vaccines right what what is that so you", "96:25", "know it was for instance if you look", "96:27", "over a 10-year period I think it is", "96:29", "between and haven't looked at the", "96:31", "numbers in a while I think it's between", "96:33", "2008 and 2014 2015 over that period of", "96:39", "time there were 2.5 billion doses of", "96:42", "vaccine given 2.5 billion of which the", "96:46", "vaccine courts identified around 200", "96:49", "that were a list of serious injuries", "96:53", "that could be that they have a", "96:55", "Abell love that they could attribute to", "96:57", "vaccines so there were 2,000 payouts on", "97:01", "of those 2,000 80% they didn't really", "97:03", "think we're attributed to vaccines but", "97:05", "they paid it out anyway because that's", "97:07", "how the courts work and then 200 where", "97:09", "they could really say yeah it looks like", "97:11", "this could be related to vaccine so you", "97:13", "divide 200 by 2.5 billion that's one in", "97:16", "10 million or even 2,000 by 2.5 billions", "97:20", "it's one in a million and these cases", "97:23", "what was happening to these people other", "97:25", "than the shoulder injury that you were", "97:27", "talking about yeah there's a there's a", "97:28", "list and I talked about it in the book", "97:30", "there's actually a table you can", "97:31", "download on the web of each vaccine a", "97:34", "list of potential injuries that they", "97:36", "allow and these potential injuries is it", "97:39", "as we were talking about earlier is this", "97:41", "just biological variability that some", "97:43", "people just react differently to", "97:44", "different things I think in some cases", "97:46", "we don't know in other cases you know", "97:49", "with the live virus vaccines if you have", "97:53", "a severe genetic immune deficiency and", "97:57", "maybe it wasn't picked up then then", "97:59", "there is that risk but you know what's", "98:01", "what's the one-in-a-million what's the", "98:02", "one in a 10 million risk as I said we", "98:04", "have to keep that in perspective because", "98:06", "the gods are getting hit by lightning is", "98:07", "one in a 700 thousand and you believe", "98:10", "that number or you know what's the risk", "98:12", "every time you take your child out in a", "98:14", "car and drive around the neighborhood", "98:15", "I'm sure the risk is far higher than one", "98:18", "in a million and the real danger is", "98:20", "these actual infectious disease is", "98:22", "spreading and the damage they could do", "98:24", "damage things like that they're coming", "98:25", "back yeah yeah yeah meet me Szell's is", "98:28", "it as an awful disease causes measles", "98:30", "encephalitis measles pneumonia I find", "98:33", "that a lot of people that are that are", "98:36", "steadfast in their resistance to", "98:39", "vaccines they they also believe in a lot", "98:42", "of other questionable things it seems", "98:45", "like these things get lumped into these", "98:47", "groups of things that they don't trust", "98:49", "the government about right right yeah I", "98:52", "think that's part I think that's", "98:53", "probably true", "98:54", "yeah that's which was she government", "98:58", "which was which was in turmoil you know", "99:00", "it was interesting so you know I said we", "99:02", "know we need to hear from the Centers", "99:04", "for Disease Control more in the Surgeon", "99:05", "General now the", "99:07", "starting to speak out but you know", "99:08", "people counter that's a well part of the", "99:10", "problems people don't trust their", "99:11", "government I say that's true of some but", "99:13", "I think most people if you know if we", "99:16", "had a you know more visible public", "99:19", "health force out there people would", "99:21", "listen to it well I think that what", "99:23", "you're talking about in terms of these", "99:25", "poor neighborhoods in these parasites", "99:27", "getting into people's system and", "99:29", "infecting cognitive development and but", "99:31", "it was the other one besides chaga it", "99:32", "was the Toxocara assist the process", "99:35", "cognitive develop and the fact that", "99:37", "there is actual cures for these things", "99:38", "to I mean that I estimated in a paper", "99:41", "there are 2.8 million African Americans", "99:43", "living in poverty with toxic horizons", "99:46", "Wow this is not a rare

dramatic it's not not", "99:56", "Ebola it's not healing people is this", "99:58", "mostly and this is requirements as well", "100:00", "it's probably it's more in common in the", "100:02", "south than in the north is it because", "100:04", "they have long longer time to do this", "100:06", "yeah as the eggs are of the eggs are and", "100:09", "the environment and the worm develops", "100:10", "with it within the egg is there any", "100:12", "other diseases that are going wrong that", "100:14", "we don't know about yeah yeah sure", "100:18", "there's other there's a brain parasitic", "100:21", "infection called cysticercosis", "100:24", "that one is from eggs often from", "100:28", "individuals who have a tapeworm so", "100:30", "that's we're seeing cases of that", "100:33",

"100:43", "hmm that's got very high rates of not", "100:46", "only encephalitis but also are one of", "100:49", "our faculty members Christy Murray is", "100:51", "showing very high rates of depression", "100:53", "and other neurologic debilitation for", "100:56", "and that's another one we could probably", "100:57", "use a vaccine for but there isn't the", "100:59", "market incentive to do it West Nile", "101:01", "virus does come up though that least", "101:03", "that's discussed in the news and people", "101:05", "aware of it right right said it right", "101:07", "but there's no vaccine there's no", "101:09", "vaccine but there could be what is it", "101:10", "there could be I was holding it back", "101:12", "what's holding it back is lack of market", "101:14", "forces lack of financial incentive for", "101:17", "the pharmaceutical companies to take it", "101:19", "on so", "101:20", "there's an extremely large investment to", "101:23", "develop something along those lines", "101:25", "that's right yeah I mean vaccines are", "101:27", "for an investor's perspective tough sell", "101:30", "because you know there's a possibility", "101:33", "you know first of all you need many", "101:34", "years of clinical trials it can", "101:36", "sometimes take two decades from the", "101:38", "original conception of a vaccine to", "101:41", "actually going through a clinical trial", "101:42", "so the hookworm vaccine I've been", "101:44", "working on we've been doing it since the", "101:47", "1990s so we're talking decades long time", "101:51", "horizons when you talk to an investor", "101:52", "about something with decades long time", "101:54", "horizons you know I figure it out right", "101:56", "the light the lights go out I mean very", "101:59", "very quickly so where it gets gross", "102:01", "right because this is all we're relying", "102:03", "on these private businesses to invest", "102:07", "money to cure a public health issue", "102:09", "that's right that's right that seems", "102:11", "kind of crazy well so in response to", "102:13", "that what happened was after the Ebola", "102:16", "Fiasco in 2014 where we didn't have an", "102:18", "Ebola vaccine in Guinea Liberia and", "102:21", "Sierra Leone a group of individuals came", "102:25", "together at Davos the World Economic", "102:26", "Forum and including the Gates
