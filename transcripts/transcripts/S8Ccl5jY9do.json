comes over", "09:28", "here and then here very hard really to", "09:31", "do in here that's the goal that's really", "09:35", "not that hard I played this game against", "09:37", "my top students on the day on a daily", "09:40", "basis so the best thing for you to do is", "09:43", "keep both your hands on the chest both", "09:45", "of them", "09:45", "and then yes that's that's because now", "09:47", "you have an opportunity or maybe posture", "09:49", "up you do it so what I want to do", "09:51", "immediately span now you can't punch me", "09:53", "and now you can't posture because you",
