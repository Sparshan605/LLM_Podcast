thinking like I", "22:34", "remember when I was a kid and then I'll", "22:35", "just like out of nowhere have this idea", "22:38", "and I'm hoping it's gonna go somewhere", "22:40", "and those moments I feel like they're", "22:45", "like it's like foraging for food like", "22:49", "occasionally you find it like if you go", "22:51", "out looking for mushrooms you don't know", "22:53", "where they are you might find edible", "22:54", "mushrooms hopefully you're gonna find", "22:56", "them again sometimes you won't sometimes", "22:58", "you come home in an empty basket but", "23:00", "sometimes you get them and the only way", "23:01", "you find out is if you forage and that's", "23:04", "kind of what it feels like when I'm high", "23:05", "on stage it's like okay but then I'm", "23:09", "also really worried that I'm gonna be", "23:12", "boring like I want to be I know these", "23:15", "people paid to see I know I'm trying to", "23:17", "develop material but I also know I'm", "23:19", "entertaining these people in the present", "23:20", "so it's like a fine line yeah I don't", "23:23", "have that confidence to waste the", "23:24", "audience this time I'll see Chris Rock", "23:28", "yeah a friend of mine and he'll go up", "23:30", "and just like with nothing yeah and just", "23:32", "sit there and look very comfortably for", "23:35", "45 minutes and just and just and just", "23:38", "kind of talk and look for things and has", "23:40", "no problem with whatsoever now this is", "23:42", "what else he'll go what else what else", "23:44", "no like stare at the sky look at the", "23:46", "ground I can't you know was the master", "23:48", "at that was Damon Wayans oh my god ooh a", "23:52", "lot of people have forgot a lot of", "23:54", "people forgot was one of the fucking", "23:56", "still is one of the best comics ever", "23:58", "Damon was a goddamn murderer in the 90s", "24:01", "oh I love firming up but I remember", "24:04", "going to the haha cafe they would do it", "24:07", "like a show every Tuesday that my", "24:08", "friends would run and Damon Wayans would", "24:10", "always drop in and do an hour and ruin", "24:14", "the show he would have no material and", "24:16", "he would just attack people in the crowd", "24:18", "by the time he was offstage like the", "24:21", "audience was furious like they were they", "24:22", "went crazy when he came out", "24:24", "and then by the end they were just like", "24:25", "why is he doing this to us he'd be like", "24:27", "we were like oh fuck Damon Wayans is", "24:29", "here", "24:30", "really looked up to as a kid and like", "24:32", "loved you just like oh man this asshole", "24:34", "again wow that's crazy I wonder why I", "24:37", "was doing that I guess it's probably", "24:39", "because he couldn't do it at the store", "24:41", "anymore yeah what how many years ago was", "24:43", "this god I mean at least at least 10 12", "24:48", "13 years ago yeah see that puts it", "24:49", "that's that makes sense right because", "24:51", "that's around 2005 yeah that's like", "24:53", "probably he stopped going to the store", "24:55", "the store probably tightened up the way", "24:57", "they used because they used to just let", "24:59", "anybody just drop like Eddie Griffin", "25:01", "would drop in wasn't on the wasn't on", "25:04", "the schedule he would drop in at 9:00", "25:06", "p.m. and get offstage at 3:00 a.m. and", "25:09", "that was real yeah yeah that was real", "25:11", "six hours and and then when he was done", "25:18", "he was like who's next who's next six", "25:23", "hours what's the longest that you've", "25:25", "ever done I think an hour and 40 minutes", "25:28", "maybe a little longer I don't remember", "25:31", "but I think an hour and 40 minutes", "25:33", "probably the longest I've ever done yeah", "25:34", "yeah but that's too long too long yeah", "25:37", "an hour and 20 is more than anybody", "25:39", "should ever have to hear you talk yeah", "25:41", "and even that it's like pushing it what", "25:43", "I like I like I like to do when I do", "25:47", "like a theater a to an hour or an hour", "25:49", "and ten and I just well I just want to", "25:51", "just start and then finish just come on", "25:55", "go ready and then for one hour I want", "25:59", "everything to be tight and concise and I", "26:02", "would way rather have an hour and 10", "26:04", "minutes that people really enjoyed", "26:06", "versus an hour and a half were there", "26:08", "like an hour of it was really funny cuz", "26:10", "then that leaves you with this even if", "26:12", "it's the same hour that extra time I", "26:15", "also just think the audience doesn't", "26:17", "want to see more than an hour of comedy", "26:18", "no and it's like like people work I did", "26:20", "three hours the other night like wow", "26:22", "like the audience must have hated it", "26:24", "like Chappelle used to drop into the", "26:26", "cellar he and like

Marley eventually broke", "26:35", "it or something", "26:36", "marlee from maine yeah yeah I didn't he", "26:37", "do like two days on stage and but", "26:42", "Chappelle was down there one time and I", "26:43", "was like oh I'm gonna check it out and", "26:44", "it was like almost unwatchable yeah cuz", "26:47", "it was like the pacing that they had", "26:48", "that you have to do in order to be on", "26:50", "stage that long and he was funny but he", "26:52", "would be like not funny for long", "26:53", "stretches than a big punch line yeah and", "26:55", "then back into it you're like all right", "26:57", "like I was when Dave was on hiatus right", "27:00", "that was when Dave kind of like took", "27:03", "time off a comedy for a long time he cut", "27:05", "I mean kind of like he was
