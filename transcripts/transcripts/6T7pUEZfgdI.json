well that first that isn't what we", "11:24", "do in the West let's say we put your", "11:27", "individual identity paramount and then", "11:29", "well that's just that's just for", "11:32", "starters fundamentally and then I guess", "11:35", "the other reason that people are on my", "11:37", "case to some degree is because I have", "11:39", "made a strong case which i think is", "11:41", "fully documented by the scientific", "11:43", "literature that there are intrinsic", "11:44", "differences say between men and women", "11:46", "and I think the evidence and that this", "11:48", "is the thing that staggered me is that", "11:49", "no serious scientists have debated that", "11:53", "for like four decades", "11:55", "it's that argument was done by the time", "11:58", "I went to graduate school everyone knew", "12:00", "that human beings were not a blank slate", "12:03", "that biological forces not parameterised", "12:07", "the way that we thought and and felt and", "12:09", "acted and and and valued everyone knew", "12:13", "that the fact that this has become", "12:14", "somehow debatable again is just", "12:16", "especially because it's being done by", "12:18", "legislative Fiat they're forcing it to", "12:21", "me as a scientist it's just it's just", "12:22", "well and in the states too with title", "12:24", "with title nine for example because", "12:26", "title nine is sort of predicated on that", "12:28", "viewpoint what is title man Oh title", "12:30", "nine was originally just a piece of", "12:31", "legislation that mandated that female", "12:35", "sports teams were funded to the same", "12:37", "degree that male sports teams were", "12:38", "funded in the American universities but", "12:40", "it's been expanded out so that if", "12:42", "there's any differences in any areas", "12:44", "whatsoever between the genders then the", "12:46", "universities are being taken to court", "12:48", "and like two hundred I mean last I", "12:50", "looked about 200 of them were up and", "12:53", "they can have their funding revoked if", "12:55", "they violate the title nine provisions", "12:56", "so it's become like a vicious weapon for", "12:58", "social justice warrior equality of", "13:01", "outcome types it's not just about sports", "13:05", "no it's got way way beyond that yeah", "13:08", "it's it's it's become an equality of", "13:10", "outcome issue fundamentally there was an", "13:14", "article that I sent you one of them was", "13:16", "from I think like I I forgot I got it", "13:19", "off of digg.com but", "13:21", "it was Jordan Peterson is having his", "13:23", "moment and we should ignore him I send", "13:25", "this to you and there was one of the", "13:26", "party hey the last part of that might be", "13:29", "true one of the things in the article", "13:33", "was citing this study that showed very", "13:37", "little difference oh yeah amen and damn", "13:39", "study yeah it's a pathetic study yeah I", "13:42", "sent it to you because I was like this", "13:43", "this is not right well the thing is like", "13:46", "most things it's complicated yes you", "13:49", "know so our men and women more similar", "13:52", "or more different well it depends on how", "13:54", "you define the terms first but they're", "13:57", "more similar well why well they're the", "13:59", "same species so we could start with that", "14:02", "like but the question is what are the", "14:05", "differences and how do they manifest", "14:07", "themselves and are those manifestations", "14:08", "important so here's an example if you", "14:11", "took a random woman out of the", "14:14", "population and a random man and you had", "14:16", "to bet on who was more temperamental e", "14:18", "aggressive if you bet on the man you'd", "14:20", "be right 60 percent of the time but", "14:23", "you'd be wrong forty percent of the time", "14:25", "and that that's not a walloping", "14:26", "difference right 60/40 it's not ninety", "14:28", "ten like so there's quite there's a lot", "14:30", "of overlap between men and women in", "14:32", "terms of their levels of aggression and", "14:34", "you think well they're more the same", "14:35", "yeah except so then let's say no no", "14:40", "let's play a slightly different game", "14:41", "let's pick the one in a hundred most", "14:44", "aggressive person from the random", "14:46", "population well they're all men and", "14:49", "that's why all the people in prison are", "14:51", "men so even though on average most women", "14:55", "most law yeah it's 90 90 90 to 95", "14:58", "percent right so and often if the women", "15:00", "are in prison is because they got", "15:01", "tangled up with a really bad guy you", "15:03", "know so so one of the problems is is", "15:07", "that difference is at the extreme are", "15:10", "where the differences really start to", "15:12", "manifest themselves and so you can have", "15:14", "a small difference at the level of the", "15:15", "average but out at the extremes it", "15:19", "starts to make a massive difference so", "15:21", "let's say to be a Google engineer which", "15:24", "is hard right because you not only have", "15:26", "to be an engineer but you have to be a", "15:27", "very good engineer say well you have to", "15:29", "be interested in things rather than", "15:31", "people that's that's a huge difference", "15:33", "in interest like", "15:34", "men are more interested in things", "15:36", "generally speaking and women are more", "15:38", "interested in people generally speaking", "15:40", "now there's still a lot of overlap", "15:41", "between them but that's one of the", "15:43", "biggest differences between men and", "15:44", "women it's been demonstrated cross", "15:46", "culturally it's also a very big", "15:47", "difference in the Scandinavian countries", "15:48", "well on average the difference isn't", "15:52", "that great even though it's a relatively", "15:54", "large difference but at the extremes", "15:55", "it's the same thing almost all the", "15:57", "people are hyper what would you call", "16:00", "hyper focused on things they're almost", "16:03", "all men and all the people who are hyper", "16:05", "focused on people are almost all women", "16:07", "and so how does that play out in the", "16:09", "world well in the Scandinavian countries", "16:10", "it plays out this way about eighty-five", "16:13", "percent of nurses in Scandinavia are", "16:15", "female and about 85 to 90 percent of", "16:18", "Engineers are male that doesn't mean", "16:20", "women can't be engineers it doesn't mean", "16:22", "men can't be nurses it also doesn't have", "16:24", "anything to do with intelligence but it", "16:27", "does have to do with interest and the", "16:28", "differences in interest are big now at", "16:31", "the extremes in particular so when you", "16:33", "read a review like that the one that was", "16:35", "pointed out the first question is well", "16:37", "what do you mean by big and little", "16:39", "there's more overlap there's more", "16:41", "overlap between men and women than there", "16:43", "is difference on virtually every", "16:44", "parameter okay fine", "16:46", "are the remaining difference is", "16:48", "significant in how they play out in the", "16:49", "world and the answer to that is", "16:50", "overwhelmingly

way", "26:01", "the left the radical lefties have been", "26:03", "going after Mia constantly is well", "26:05", "there's one reason is is if you stand up", "26:07", "against the radical radical left
