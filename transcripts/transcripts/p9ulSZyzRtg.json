that then", "25:15", "they go into an environment where it's", "25:16", "only failure and they go I don't want to", "25:18", "do this I think if I had a guess I think", "25:20", "stand-up is at least 20 to 25 percent", "25:23", "harder for women this is why okay I", "25:26", "think there's subjects that especially", "25:28", "when you're starting out men don't want", "25:30", "to hear from you in the audience okay", "25:32", "men don't want to hear about politics", "25:33", "you have a bigger hurdle when it comes", "25:36", "to points of view politics or advice", "25:39", "anything where a

"instinct to not like it yeah there's", "26:39", "another reason to its that Taylor stare", "26:43", "which I like is that women on stage", "26:45", "early on oh there's why it's harder for", "26:47", "men it's just the first six months or so", "26:48", "we martyr for men just the first six", "26:50", "months women are used to people looking", "26:52", "at them and for men it's this weird new", "26:54", "thing where it's like why you looking at", "26:56", "me strange showing the first like right", "26:58", "away and open mics like early on women", "27:00", "are way more comfortable on stage than", "27:01", "men", "27:02", "hmm for the most part and then that it", "27:04", "evens out but those first few months", "27:06", "it's this thing of like um this is not a", "27:08", "comfortable thing women it's a negative", "27:10", "that had to deal with that their whole", "27:11", "lives but like people are staring at", "27:13", "them all the time", "27:13", "hmm I think we struggle with this idea", "27:17", "of like like saying that I think it's", "27:19", "harder for women I think it's harder for", "27:21", "men because it's a generalization yeah", "27:24", "it's harder for that some men it's", "27:26", "waiting for what see that's that's when", "27:28", "they black and white it that's when you", "27:29", "fucking ruin all the arguments uh-huh", "27:31", "you know it's just like 10% harder 15%", "27:34", "honor I think one of the reasons it is", "27:36", "harder career-wise for I mean almost all", "27:40", "women is because success too early can", "27:44", "hurt you in the long run if you start", "27:46", "thinking I'm good it's something you're", "27:48", "terrible you don't work as hard this is", "27:50", "human nature thing wife more for women", "27:53", "than for men because we're in such a", "27:55", "category of needing women performers", "27:58", "that we go earlier and earlier in", "27:59", "development in order to plug them up huh", "28:01", "because I need to put a woman on stick", "28:03", "on TV you know and there's you know this", "28:07", "developed women Silverman is like I", "28:09", "doing that I don't want to Segura's yeah", "28:12",

"28:19", "got to put a woman on huh you know if", "28:21", "you have a lot of comics but if I'm", "28:23", "getting this as a single individual", "28:24", "performer if I'm getting something five", "28:26", "years in and I start going yeah I'm", "28:27", "pretty fucking good I don't have to work", "28:29", "this hard you know when I start getting", "28:30", "more and more things I work less and", "28:32", "less hard it's another reason why the", "28:33", "fucking", "28:34", "celebrity comics aren't as good as non", "28:36", "celebrity comics but if you start", "28:38", "getting stuff you start", "28:40", "I don't need to work that hard to get it", "28:42", "if you have to study for an hour to get", "28:44", "an A you know I mean then why would you", "28:46", "study for seven hours
