well you believe what's the", "10:16", "smoking pistol you believe in equity", "10:18", "it's like that's that's a smoking pistol", "10:20", "as far as I'm concerned but it doesn't", "10:22", "have the same emotional punch as you", "10:24", "wore a swastika to the protest yeah you", "10:26", "believe in equity and you refuse to", "10:28", "define it that would be right right but", "10:31",

"10:37", "hmm that's right", "10:38", "um I do want to back us up here though", "10:40", "because the I think we underrate the", "10:44", "danger of and I think Nazis are a red", "10:48", "herring there is something that actually", "10:50", "does threaten to reemerge and", "10:52", "Charlottesville is a version of it but I", "10:56", "think because we have a cartoon", "10:57", "understanding of

what you mean by this", "11:34", "so my point would be that what took", "11:37", "place in Germany in the 30s was a", "11:41", "particularly particularly visible well", "11:48", "documented example of a pattern that is", "11:50", "much more common in human history", "11:52", "and because this pattern emerges as a", "11:55", "result of certain features of the way", "11:58", "evolution functions in

"flies under a different flag or", "12:39", "something like that", "12:40", "and so I do think that looking at the", "12:43", "tiny number of people who were doing", "12:45", "what they were doing in

rule", "92:59", "is the square root of the number of", "93:01", "people under consideration have half of", "93:03", "whatever it is that's under", "93:04", "consideration so this works everywhere",

here's", "93:39", "one of those places where it's actually", "93:40", "empirically true this happens everywhere", "93:42", "and so what Marx observed was that", "93:45", "capital tended to accumulate

people successful and one", "98:20", "of the things that makes people", "98:22", "successful is they specify a target and", "98:24", "then aim at it right because if you're", "98:27", "all over the

Bob", "141:12", "Trivers that I mentioned at the", "141:13", "beginning was that Hitler was a monster", "141:17", "as we all know but he was a rational", "141:20", "monster that the program that he",

and so my", "141:51", "point is this is the danger that we are", "141:54", "in if we allow ourselves to imagine", "141:58", "and that Jenna Seidel impulses are more", "142:04", "or less gone from the world because", "142:05", "we've all assumed we've all agree that", "142:07", "they're a bad thing and the point is", "142:09", "that they exist in a latent program and", "142:12", "at a point when you have austerity as a", "142:16", "result of usually a an opportunity that", "142:21", "has run its course and has resulted in", "142:23", "the population growing to fill that", "142:25",

the", "142:42", "point is that is an ever-present danger", "142:44", "for us okay so I want to clarify one", "142:47", "thing I'm sure because this argument was", "142:49", "sort of phrased as we have a", "142:51", "disagreement about Hitler and I would", "142:53", "like to point out that I don't actually", "142:54", "disagree with anything that you just", "142:56", "said okay if I remain

saw in", "144:03", "your video was your argument was that as", "144:06", "he was losing instead of", "144:08", "putting the genocide on pause and", "144:13", "winning and winning the warning that", "144:15", "hehe ratcheted it up the jam yeah I", "144:18", "don't know if it would really be I don't", "144:19", "think it's necessarily fair to say that", "144:21", "it was him that did that although I", "144:23", "think he had a hand in it it does appear", "144:25", "to me that that's what happened right", "144:27", "and my point would simply be and again", "144:30", "there", "144:31", "I

did", "146:37", "was go after a population inside his", "146:42", "border that was more distantly related", "146:44", "to the people who were his constituents", "146:47", "and then he went obviously

this just so that this", "147:50", "the track of this remains self-evident", "147:53", "is to caution people against to alert", "147:57", "people to the fact that the sorts of", "147:59", "programs

the idea that the effectiveness of", "160:30", "this meme is that it tangles people with", "160:33", "no sense of humor in knots and that's a", "160:37", "huge part of why those things are", "160:38",

using", "160:55", "it to taunt people yes can't figure out", "160:58", "I think that's the vast majority of it I", "161:00", "do believe that and I think the same", "161:02", "thing about the keka Stanny types is", "161:04", "that that's almost all humour yeah and", "161:06", "there's some massive problem with", "161:08", "pushing back against that and calling", "161:10", "those people Nazis and racists and", "161:12", "especially when they're just using humor", "161:14", "and especially when it's very clear if", "161:16", "you look at all the memes online and I", "161:18", "went
