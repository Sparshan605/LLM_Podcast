"41:36", "interesting it's gonna be interesting to", "41:38", "see a Brian could turn to a jujitsu", "41:39", "match but the thing about Brian is he's", "41:41", "so comfortable with his hands man he's", "41:43", "getting more company and doesn't train", "41:45", "doesn't like the super team yeah he's", "41:47", "amazing", "41:48", "but max Holloway dude when I saw the", "41:50", "second fight with Aldo the second fight", "41:53", "with although there was some moments in", "41:54", "that fight where I was like cheese well", "41:56", "he's one of my favorite first dudes on", "41:57", "another", "41:58", "I know but he was overwhelming although", "42:00", "like he went into that fight you know", "42:02", "and basically when they announced the", "42:04", "this is where the his phrase where it", "42:06", "started to hit me it is what it is you", "42:08", "know I love it that was his attitude to", "42:12", "go fight an absolute future", "42:14", "hall-of-famer who was thought to be the", "42:16", "greatest featherweight of all time a guy", "42:18", "who you know think about some of the", "42:20", "spectacular chaos of Chad Mendes and I", "42:23", "mean he was a monster

super", "42:53", "short known I also think what the reason", "42:56", "why I love this fight it's so good for", "42:57", "the UFC especially just for the both of", "42:59", "them is Max and Brian are gonna fight", "43:01", "multiple times this I think this isn't", "43:04", "become a cool rivalry are you gonna see", "43:06", "him go from 45 whoever wins is I don't", "43:08", "like Carrie I love both those men I", "43:10", "fucking love both those guys whoever", "43:12", "wins I think eventually they're both", "43:14", "huge for the weight class and Max is", "43:16", "younger than Brian they're gonna go to", "43:17", "55 even Max's team goes he should be a", "43:20", "55 he's fucking huge 445 well you think", "43:22", "about how much weight he had to lose to", "43:24", "get to 55 I know he pulled them off the", "43:27", "weight cut to 55 which is crazy", "43:29", "55 there's some fight for him but I", "43:31", "think and this is great for fighters man", "43:33", "like with with
