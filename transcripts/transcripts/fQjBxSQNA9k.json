way you can", "55:33", "get coverage is you have to do with this", "55:34", "one company then then it becomes a real", "55:36", "issue and not only does it become an", "55:37", "issue but the other issue is that the", "55:40", "real question is if you are a service", "55:42", "provider and you provide people in this", "55:45", "area that service if the other service", "55:48", "has if you use
