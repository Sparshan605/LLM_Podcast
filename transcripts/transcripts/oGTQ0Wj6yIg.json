"09:31", "course I was already prepared", "09:33", "unfortunately many of my peers were not", "09:36", "so I didn't experience racism had I", "09:40", "lived here my you know my whole life I", "09:41", "might have had a different perspective", "09:43", "and not taking this path so I was very", "09:46", "curious about it and fascinated with it", "09:49", "like how can somebody hate you and they", "09:51", "don't even know you", "09:51", "it was just beyond my comprehension and", "09:54", "I knew something was wrong because the", "09:57", "people who did this to me did not look",

right there you know", "10:09", "at the school where I went where we did", "10:11", "the March so I knew it wasn't a color", "10:15", "thing in fact when my parents told me", "10:18", "this I did not believe my parents I felt", "10:21", "for some reason my parents are lying to", "10:23", "me because my ten year old brain could", "10:25", "not process the idea there's someone who", "10:28", "had

"11:07", "destruction all in the name of this new", "11:09", "word that I had learned called racism", "11:12", "and so then I realized my parents had", "11:15", "told me the truth this phenomenon called", "11:18", "racism does exist but why I'd understand", "11:22", "why okay so it's here but why and so", "11:25", "that's when I formed that question how", "11:27", "can you hate me", "11:28", "we don't even know me and so I've been", "11:31", "looking for the answer to that question", "11:32", "now for 51 years I'm uh 16 years old so", "11:38", "after I uh I met this Klansmen sure Oh", "11:43", "maybe he I don't know three or four", "11:45", "months later I quit that band and went", "11:48", "back to playing rock and roll and blues", "11:49", "and R&B and then it dawned on me Darryl", "11:53", "you know the answer that you've been", "11:55", "seeking since h10 fell right into your", "11:58", "lap who better to ask that question of", "12:04", "how can you hate me we don't even know", "12:06", "me than to ask it of somebody who would", "12:09", "go so far as to join an organization", "12:12", "whose sole apprentice has been hating", "12:16", "people who do not look like them and who", "12:18", "do not believe as they believe and this", "12:20", "organization has been around for over a", "12:22", "hundred years somebody would go that far", "12:24", "to join the KKK

do every book written", "12:37", "on the plan and they all were written by", "12:39", "white authors obviously because a white", "12:42", "author would have you know less fear of", "12:44", "ramifications talking to a Klansmen or", "12:47", "interviewing them would have easier", "12:49", "access or could join the plan undercover", "12:52", "get the story get out and write about it", "12:54", "so my book became the first book ever", "12:58", "written by a black father on the foofa's", "13:00", "plan from the perspective of sitting", "13:02", "down face to face I decided I would go", "13:05", "around the country interview clan", "13:07", "leaders there in Maryland where I live", "13:08", "up north down south Midwest and West and", "13:11", "I said I would start right there
