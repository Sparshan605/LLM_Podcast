things they always talk about", "08:32", "it's like get your hands onto something", "08:36", "because the spinning makes your arms go", "08:39", "like this and if you watch a lot of old", "08:41",

ahold of", "09:24", "something because that's the one thing", "09:26", "that you can't control your you're", "09:27", "strapped in with your seat belt and", "09:28", "everything but your arms are you know", "09:30", "can go anywhere and in that moment when", "09:33", "the car is rolling or barrel rolling or", "09:34", "flipping you it's so fast", "09:38", "like you can't your arms just go this", "09:40", "way yeah that's the craziest thing in", "09:42", "the world that's the only fear I guess", "09:44", "is that your arm could get outside the", "09:46", "window and get crushed or something cuz", "09:47", "guys have had that happen I mean the", "09:49", "discourse in this country is completely", "09:50", "collapsed and I love it why do you love", "09:53", "it though that this course is come on", "09:54", "cuz my rights aren't up for discussion", "09:56", "let alone a vote so whenever people sit", "09:58", "down and have a talk about my life and", "10:00", "freedom it's gonna end badly for me so", "10:02", "if people can't talk to each other about", "10:04", "this maybe we'll go our separate ways", "10:05", "and live peacefully so you'd rather not", "10:08", "talk about it and just go peacefully is", "10:10", "that what you're saying yeah someone's", "10:11", "political opinions and preferences", "10:13", "should have as much impact in my life as", "10:15", "their sexual preferences you want to", "10:17", "fuck dudes you want to have a threesome", "10:18", "I don't I care if you're my friend and", "10:20", "that I'm interested but it's not going", "10:22", "to impact me and it shouldn't impact me", "10:23", "and same thing with the oh you want more", "10:25", "welfare great go live your", "10:27", "life that one instead of it becoming", "10:29", "some shouting match on your front door", "10:31", "and and exactly yeah instead of you and", "10:34", "your buddies coming up and skin the shit", "10:35", "out of my kids yeah I mean know what I", "10:38", "mean very few people deserve that I was", "10:40", "gonna say no one but very few people", "10:41", "deserve that yeah", "10:42", "so the disengaging from political", "10:44", "discourse as a strategy for just overall", "10:49", "civility but also worsening political", "10:51", "discourse and a purpose to make it so", "10:53", "that people can't actually form", "10:54", "coalition's and get anything done but it", "10:56", "is amazing how personal people take", "10:58", "other people's opinions on things it's", "11:00", "crazy", "11:00", "yeah it's like the people JIT you know", "11:03", "what it is it's like when you're dating", "11:04", "and you think oh this this girl likes", "11:05", "the same kind of music I do so we're", "11:07", "going to get along that is a very weak", "11:08", "correlation yeah and there's lots of", "11:10", "people who are right-wing who are good", "11:13", "people and there's lots of people who", "11:14", "are left-wing who are good people and", "11:16", "there's lots of people who are", "11:17", "right-wing who are bad people there's a", "11:19", "very weak correlation between this it's", "11:22", "a cultural signifier you probably came", "11:24", "from the same culture because people", "11:25", "just take the culture of what they grew", "11:26", "up with but if you're gonna just dismiss", "11:28", "entire schools of thought just because", "11:30", "they vote differently from you is it as", "11:31", "a personal level that's you're missing", "11:34", "out a lot of quality people perhaps", "11:36", "Erikson did before him I don't know", "11:38", "anyway you you you take an automatic", "11:40", "process and you interrupted in the", "11:42", "middle so like when you're shaking hands", "11:43", "with somebody that's a such a familiar", "11:46", "process that when you start you're not", "11:48", "thinking okay I'm gonna grip this", "11:49", "person's hand now and I'm gonna move my", "11:50", "hand up and down with them a few times", "11:52", "then I'll take my hand away you just", "11:53", "kind of do it automatically and and", "11:56", "there's something about interrupting", "11:58", "that that leaves people really flummoxed", "12:03", "and the will did because there really it", "12:04", "really caught off-guard like if you", "12:06", "imagine somebody comes up to you in the", "12:07", "street and says it's not half-past seven", "12:10", "you know your reaction isn't to go yeah", "12:12", "yeah I know it's 20 past 9:00 your", "12:14", "reaction is a sort of you you think like", "12:17", "you've missed something like you're", "12:18", "trying to make sense of it it's a", "12:19", "strange kind of put you on the back foot", "12:22", "and at that point if you if you've got", "12:24", "somebody who's fairly suggestible and", "12:26", "people coming up on stage it's such an", "12:28", "odd moment for them anyway they're", "12:29", "naturally very suggestible that a clear", "12:31", "instruction to sleep or whatever you", "12:34", "want to give them tends to be taken very", "12:36", "deeply and very often then you'll see", "12:38", "I'll shake hands and I'll break the", "12:40", "pattern at the hand", "12:40", "well I'll often take their hand and lift", "12:42", "it up to their face and say sleep and", "12:46", "show them their hand like that and they", "12:47", "just sleep and well it's not sleep but", "12:49", "it's a kind of it looks like I mean they", "12:52", "they'll do anything from eyes closed", "12:54", "head drops down to just drop like a like", "12:56", "a dead weight on the floor", "12:58", "you know I found this most interesting", "12:59", "actually was I liked applying this in", "13:02", "slightly more useful everyday situations", "13:05", "was as a sort of like a self-defense", "13:08", "technique I was walking between so I was", "13:13", "like must have been like 20 or something", "13:15", "and I was at a magic convention and I", "13:18", "was walking from one hotel to another", "13:19", "and I'm dressed like a three-piece", "13:20", "velvet soon as this skinny British might", "13:24", "as well have you know punched me in the", "13:25", "throat tattooed across my face and this", "13:28", "guy comes up and it's like he's drunk", "13:30", "it's about 3:00 in the morning drunk", "13:31", "aggressive is with his girlfriend", "13:33", "clearly looking for a fight and he sort", "13:37", "of he comes up to me and he says what", "13:39", "are you what are you fucking looking at", "13:40", "what you looking at and because I had", "13:43", "spoken about this how to deal with this", "13:45", "sort of thing but had never found myself", "13:46", "in this situation I kind of had it all", "13:48", "mentally rehearsed so I said to him I", "13:50", "said the wall outside my house isn't", "13:52", "four foot high and I guess there's an", "13:57", "equivalent to this with a sort of", "13:58", "adrenaline dump I think it's called in", "13:59", "in martial arts but there's a it's just", "14:01", "like he's got all this adrenaline and", "14:03", "then a thing like that from me which is", "14:06", "just out of context like it makes sense", "14:07", "I'm not like talking gibberish it makes", "14:09", "sense but it's just out of context so", "14:11", "now suddenly he's thinking I've what", "14:13", "I've missed something so now he he was", "14:16", "sort of went what and I said and the", "14:18", "girlfriend walked off and I said though", "14:19", "the wall outside my house isn't for for", "14:21", "hi I spent some time in Spain the walls", "14:23", "that were very high but if you look at", "14:25", "the ones here that they're tiny that", "14:26", "nothing and then he just sort of broke", "14:29", "down he's literate and start crying well", "14:33", "you know no wasn't quite crying but it", "14:34", "was just it was like all the adrenaline", "14:36", "and everything just just flooded out of", "14:39", "him and he sat down and I end up sitting", "14:41", "next to him on the like you know on the", "14:43", "roadside asking him you know so what I", "14:47", "was the plan was I was gonna try and", "14:48", "stick his feet to the floor and I had", "14:50", "his whole plan he just kind of collapsed", "14:51", "and sat down", "14:52", "so I sliced his feet", "14:54", "yeah that was because I knew it'd be", "14:55", "like this highly suggestible stay and", "14:57", "either way the moment of aggression and", "14:59", "past but I ended up ended up weirdly", "15:01", "sitting with him asking him what had", "15:03", "happened that evening and his girlfriend", "15:05", "it I think she'd bottled somebody or", "15:06", "something horrible attack so he got out", "15:08", "with all this aggression but it's it's a", "15:09", "good wasn't it if you just have like um", "15:11", "it could be just a song lyric or just", "15:13", "some some weird kind of thing that you", "15:15", "can just go into is in those situations", "15:18", "that I mean if someone's running you", "15:19", "with a knife it's a bit difficult but", "15:20", "you just you you're kind of strangely", "15:23", "taking control of a situation", "15:30", "[Applause]", "English (auto-generated)"]
