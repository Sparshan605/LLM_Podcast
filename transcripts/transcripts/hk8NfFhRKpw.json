tastes", "87:31", "like ass yeah like all this got judges", "87:33", "like shit and then you get a few red", "87:35", "flags if you made some questionable", "87:37", "decisions and then you get removed from", "87:39", "the queue yeah and you can't judge", "87:40", "anymore or you can't judge high-level", "87:43", "fights or you have to prove yourself or", "87:44", "whatever the fuck you got to do but I", "87:46", "think having that as a fourth judging", "87:48", "and the fourth option maybe even coming", "87:51", "to it if it's a closed disputed decision", "87:54", "yeah if it's closed let's go to the", "87:55", "internet judge let's see what that was", "87:57", "and then you know take that into", "87:59", "consideration or or what I mean I don't", "88:01", "know how you would factor it in what", "88:02", "would be most valuable whether it's the", "88:04", "in-person judges or the internet judge", "88:06", "yeah because it's a different experience", "88:07", "not being there as well maybe give them", "88:09", "half a point", "88:10", "yeah like is that does that make sense", "88:12", "that it's a different experience", "88:14", "watching it cage sight as it is watching", "88:17", "it on television and it almost wouldn't", "88:18", "be fair if they only watch it on", "88:20", "television it's completely different", "88:22", "yeah because there's so much your", "88:23", "condition what you can't see your judges", "88:25", "have screens in front of them don't they", "88:27", "yeah and you can they do have screens if", "88:29", "they want to catch angles they do now", "88:31", "it's something that we complained about", "88:32", "for a long fucking time before they", "88:35", "finally gave in and giving them screens", "88:37", "because there's certain angles where if", "88:38", "someone if I'm on", "88:40", "inside the cage and there's a ground", "88:42", "fight going on the exact opposite side", "88:44", "of the cage I can't see what's going on", "88:45", "if a guy has his back to me and the", "88:47", "other guy has I don't know what he's I", "88:49", "have to see him on it's the only way to", "88:50", "see it exactly", "88:51", "so finally judges get to see that", "88:53", "because for the longest time some of the", "88:55", "questionable decisions could be boiled", "88:58", "down to that like that you didn't get a", "88:59", "good angle to see exactly what was", "89:01", "happening the whole time so in a close", "89:03", "like ten nine sort of a situation where", "89:05", "it could go either way there's a lot of", "89:07", "fights where it could kind of go either", "89:08", "way", "89:09", "yeah well after the round was over like", "89:11", "fuck they have to choose a winner here", "89:13", "yeah and I would how I mean how much do", "89:16", "you do refs judges go off punched at so", "89:19", "they know them right away I don't think", "89:20", "they know them at all no that's the kind", "89:21", "of thing that needs to get figured out", "89:23", "like we have them I know but I'm saying", "89:25", "that that they right they should want", "89:27", "that information to judge a fight I", "89:29", "don't think they get it I'm pretty sure", "89:30", "they don't get it so like when we're", "89:32", "what I think that could influence them", "89:34", "yeah yeah but I think that's why they", "89:36", "don't get it I need to find that out for", "89:37", "sure I should ask my dog Mike Goldberg", "89:39", "I'll text him that's how strong this is", "89:41", "while this is going on if they don't", "89:45", "know the numbers and that's that's", "89:46", "bullshit because they need to know they", "89:47", "need to see those numbers yeah yeah it", "89:50", "seems like that would be something just", "89:52", "like the just like the monitors that", "89:54", "would be a no-brainer but it's hard man", "89:57", "it's hard to get change change is", "89:59", "fucking hard you know especially when", "90:01", "it's run by the state", "90:02", "yes and that's what people need to", "90:03", "understand it's not this is not as", "90:05", "simple as like the UFC needs to", "90:07", "implement the know you're dealing with a", "90:09", "whole bureaucracy you're dealing with", "90:10", "people that don't want to lose their", "90:12", "jobs you're dealing with it's really", "90:14", "tough to fire people because it's a", "90:15", "government gig yes it's not the same", "90:17", "yeah you know and that's part of it like", "90:19", "there's a lot of people that are judges", "90:21", "that I like as human beings I always say", "90:23", "hi to them they're very nice people I", "90:24", "just don't think they're qualified to do", "90:26", "what they're doing and I think I think", "90:28", "there should be and look at them and see", "90:30", "that yeah yeah there should be some sort", "90:32", "of some sort of like absolute baseline", "90:37", "knowledge that you have to have had you", "90:39", "have to have some experience in some", "90:41", "sort of combat sport exactly III think", "90:43", "that fighters or judges should have been", "90:47", "fighters with so many fights it's a good", "90:49", "idea you know or or at least hire a", "90:51", "stand-up judge", "90:54", "wrestling judge and you know and a", "90:56", "granite ridge it's a judge or you know", "90:57", "some sort of and then have a fourth", "90:58", "anime I don't know just they didn't need", "91:00", "to figure out something because everyone", "91:02", "has to have knowledge and I think the", "91:05", "entire sport instead of just one facet", "91:06", "of it yeah I think you're right too but", "91:08", "man if you had just two Jitsu judges", "91:10", "those motherfuckers would be so

I", "121:03", "think it's I know it's startling really", "121:04", "light and they go all the way up to 195", "121:07", "and then heavyweight and that's the", "121:09", "deviation like the UFC the only gap they", "121:11", "have that's more interesting as the 205", "121:13", "to 265 yeah that's where they need to", "121:16", "put at least I think a weight class yeah", "121:18", "a 240 or something too and I think also", "121:20", "in between 85 and 205 would be good I", "121:22", "think so yeah I could see that because", "121:23", "you know just making every 10 pounds I", "121:25", "think so today at work I think so too", "121:27", "and I think that the big example that is", "121:30", "between 55 and 170 that's especially as", "121:33", "you get low in percentage of body weight", "121:35", "that's those those jumps between that", "121:37", "one and the 185 to light heavyweight", "121:39", "those are big jumps now yeah 15 pounds", "121:41", "is a is a lot of person

not you go oh god no I gotta lose", "122:05", "the weight now like you got a we got to", "122:07", "be realistic about this yeah and", "122:09", "especially because the the way the", "122:10", "sports have evolved people get stuck in", "122:12", "certain weight classes because they're", "122:13", "good for that way class mm-hm and then", "122:16", "they try and cut weight or they train", "122:17",

the", "164:35", "difference is in a boxing match", "164:37", "there's ten nine and then there's ten", "164:39", "eight if there's a knockdown it's like", "164:40", "it's easier to define ten seven there's", "164:42", "two knockdowns it's pretty easy to", "164:43", "define it's very rare that fighter gets", "164:45", "knocked down but wins the round whereas", "164:47", "an MMA you're dealing

getting", "165:26", "a near submission yeah like if a guy", "165:28", "takes you down but you almost get him a", "165:29", "triangle like hmm how does a judge", "165:31", "really know how to score that correctly", "165:33", "that's it gets tricky right especially", "165:34", "not some random person who got their job", "165:36", "just because they know uh yeah they know", "165:39", "someone who works there yeah I mean I'm", "165:41", "sure they teach them some stuff but my", "165:43", "take on it has always been there's so", "165:44", "many fans out there that would love that", "165:46",
