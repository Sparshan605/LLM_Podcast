trying all over the world", "43:43", "yeah and in every single time it's", "43:45", "implemented the have you ever had a", "43:47", "conversation with someone who's a", "43:48", "socialist who many times so am I better", "43:51", "better friends or socialists really we", "43:52", "really get into it yeah and what is", "43:54", "there I mean does anyone have a", "43:55", "compelling perspective at all I I think", "44:00", "really socialism comes from the heart", "44:02", "right you all we all want to be", "44:04", "socialist capitalism comes from the head", "44:07", "because they're always

at", "44:33", "you know higher levels I'm a I'm a", "44:35", "Republican and at the federal level I'm", "44:36", "a libertarian right so basically the", "44:38", "larger the group of people you have",

that", "45:19", "always strikes me as a very it's a", "45:22", "deceptive term income inequality well", "45:25", "let's flip it around", "45:26", "it comes from outcome inequality yeah", "45:29", "and

years", "64:31", "it's not overnight well you know Twitter", "64:33", "took 10 years to get to the point where", "64:35", "it's at this mess right now but it was", "64:36", "so interesting to to have

shouldn't say decades but", "65:17", "I mean I was like when do you think that", "65:19", "something but there's a part of it was", "65:21", "one idea of having an uncensored Twitter", "65:24", "like one Twitter that's the Wild West", "65:26", "like you can have regular Twitter or you", "65:29", "could try Wild West Twitter like well", "65:30", "that already exists is a network called", "65:32",

"think when you look at universities in", "68:49", "particular they tend to lean left in", "68:51", "this country as well", "68:52", "well universities what happened to the", "68:56", "university is very interesting", "68:57", "universities first when you know became", "69:00", "the arbiters of data and intellectualism", "69:03", "and what's right and wrong so the time", "69:05", "period when it was like should we be", "69:07", "doing that or not well let's look at the", "69:08", "university what do they have to say what", "69:10", "are the smartest people the professors", "69:12", "that think tanks have to say and the", "69:14", "universities got this credibility from", "69:16", "the hard sciences so they got this from", "69:20", "you know physics and math and computer", "69:22", "science and chemistry because these", "69:24", "deliver real things the Manhattan", "69:26", "Project the microprocessor the space", "69:28", "vehicles and so on the electric car so", "69:31", "they gained this mantle of authority and", "69:33", "legitimacy from the hard sciences so", "69:36", "then come the social sciences kind of", "69:38", "sneaked in then you get economy", "69:40", "economics and microeconomics is a real", "69:42", "discipline real science real math behind", "69:44", "it logic reason and then you get", "69:46", "macroeconomics which can be politicized", "69:48", "a little bit more voodoo and then you", "69:49", "get social studies and then you get", "69:51", "Gender Studies and then you get blah", "69:53", "blah blah blah blah blah", "69:54", "and so what happened is that because we", "69:57", "took scientists to be the high priests", "69:59", "of our new world science itself has", "70:02", "gotten corrupted and the social sciences", "70:04", "and you can tell they're fake sciences", "70:06", "because they're the word science tacked", "70:07", "on at the end have come in and hijacked", "70:09", "the universities and become the new", "70:11", "think tanks and so essentially what you", "70:14", "see going on today in the universities", "70:16", "is a war between the social sciences and", "70:19", "the physical sciences and the crossover", "70:21", "point is biology right where you can see", "70:23", "like the whole gender is a social", "70:24", "construct movement is attacking biology", "70:27", "and evolutionary biology just like in", "70:29", "the social sphere they're coming after", "70:31", "the comedians right but you can see the", "70:32", "struggle going on the universities and I", "70:34", "would say the physical sciences are", "70:36", "essentially losing that war what can be", "70:39", "done or is it just something that has to", "70:42", "play out is it do we have to realize the", "70:43", "consequences of the foolishness well the", "70:45", "good news is the physical sciences have", "70:47", "a reality on their side", "70:49", "yeah but it's not even I mean in many", "70:53", "ways it's not respected yeah but you at", "70:56", "the end of the day your your aircraft", "70:57", "still has to fly you know your", "70:59", "microprocessor still has to compute and", "71:01", "so there's only so far they can they can", "71:03", "take it but I do see for example in", "71:06", "biology a lot of biologists are facing", "71:08", "this difficult thing where they have to", "71:10", "save things that they know are not true", "71:11", "to keep their job like what oh you had", "71:13", "Brett Weinstein on here mm-hmm right so", "71:15", "that's that's a clear example so there's", "71:18", "just the crossover line of what is", "71:20", "acceptable what's not is entering into a", "71:22", "biology and biology will probably suffer", "71:24", "the most synthetic biology for example", "71:27", "will you know a lot of this will end up", "71:29", "in China because it won't be you you", "71:33", "won't be able to map facts and reality", "71:35", "and actions together you won't be able", "71:37", "to get grants you won't be able to get", "71:39", "the adulation of your peers I don't I", "71:41", "don't know enough here so now I'm in", "71:43", "shakey territory but it's just my sense", "71:45", "that that crossover battleground right", "71:47", "now is in evolutionary biology economics", "71:49", "lost", "71:50", "well it's certainly in terms of gender", "71:52", "and that that sort of that seems to be", "71:55", "one of the major battlegrounds yeah it's", "71:58", "also gonna happen we have a blank slate", "72:00", "theory you know are we nature or we", "72:02", "nurture it's kind of socially", "72:05", "unacceptable to say that you know a lot", "72:07", "of it is nature and not nurture or vice", "72:09", "versa depending on which side you're on", "72:11", "right those kinds of discussions get", "72:13", "corrupted they do get corrupted and it's", "72:15", "really unfortunate because that's an", "72:17", "unbelievably important thing to", "72:19", "understand like what makes a person a", "72:21", "sociopath what makes a person a super", "72:24", "successful person a winner", "72:26", "what makes a person a drug addict what", "72:29", "would are what are these factors you",

"72:46", "are talking past each other anyway talk", "72:48", "about different things like when you get", "72:50", "into you know when you when you get into", "72:53", "gun control for example right one side", "72:56", "is talking about the right to bear arms", "72:58", "in case a tyrannical ruler or King tries", "73:00", "to take over the country the other time", "73:02", "the other", "73:02",

"73:09", "and it's just not politically acceptable", "73:11", "to even talk about the same thing or", "73:13", "when you gets to immigration the right", "73:15", "is talking about you know the other left", "73:19", "is like bundling together illegal", "73:21", "immigration and legal immigration into", "73:23", "one thing yes right we're in the on the", "73:25", "right sometimes you got racist hiding in", "73:27", "there so it doesn't help their cause", "73:28", "I've been talking about two different", "73:29", "things", "73:30", "yeah if they were talking about the same", "73:31", "thing which is how many immigrants", "73:33", "should we let into the country and you", "73:35", "know what are the criteria for that that", "73:37", "would be a very different conversation", "73:38", "than no immigrants or everybody comes in", "73:40", "and then also on the left you know you", "73:42", "have this benefit that everybody who's", "73:45", "currently coming in illegally is gonna", "73:46",

system hand it over to your enemies to", "73:56", "run for the next decade so for example", "73:59", "if you want a censorship on Twitter or", "74:01", "Facebook you should build that system",

if", "74:10", "you want immigration system build the", "74:12", "system then hand it over to the other", "74:14", "side to running there's how you know", "74:15", "it's a good system there's no room

fact", "74:37", "that so many of these people are on", "74:38", "psych medication right what why is that", "74:41", "not being asked we're running one of the", "74:42", "greatest mental health experiments in", "74:45", "history when we're doping everybody up", "74:47", "and SSRIs yeah and you know maybe if you", "74:50", "give thirty million people", "74:51", "SSRIs maybe like twenty nine point nine", "74:53", "million or a lot happier and then you", "74:56", "have a fraction that commits suicide or", "74:57", "detonate yeah you're basically trading", "74:59", "the mean for the

politics because there", "75:16", "we have a first-past-the-post system", "75:18", "what that means is that whoever wins 51%", "75:21", "of the vote in this country gets a lot", "75:22", "of the power

yeah", "79:10", "it's it's funny when I first started", "79:11", "meditating it was really hard right", "79:13", "because everybody I think a lot of", "79:15", "people who were listeners broadcast have", "79:16", "heard of meditation that has a good rep", "79:18", "so everybody tries it this struggle they", "79:21", "kind of give it up it's one of those", "79:22", "things that everybody says

"88:31", "go to ban plastic straws but China is", "88:33", "not gonna blend banned plastic straws", "88:35", "not until you build a paper straw that", "88:37", "is you know same cost good durability",

replacing a lot", "89:02", "of plastics with glass and paper and so", "89:04", "on yeah there's a new technology that", "89:07", "was just rhonda patrick editor twitter", "89:09", "today about they're able to convert", "89:13", "plastic waste into fuel and that there's", "89:16", "companies that are actively trying to do", "89:19", "that now so then in that way plastic", "89:22", "waste will become

the pharmaceutical company", "90:37", "should have the rights to this natural", "90:38", "plant or is or that or the government", "90:41", "does it and then the government gets the", "90:42",

just this", "90:51", "often the problem is there is no really", "90:54", "good solution there's a bunch of", "90:56", "solutions that also have drawbacks", "90:58", "that's life yeah that's the

yeah Wow and is", "119:23", "this something that you've pursued", "119:24", "through certain books or is it just like", "119:26", "you you've made an understanding or", "119:28", "gained an understanding in your own mind", "119:30", "and then started pursuing it based on I", "119:32", "understand", "119:33", "yeah it's very very personal it's", "119:36", "basically you have to decide as a", "119:37", "priority and then I tried every hack I", "119:39", "possibly could I used to you know I", "119:41", "tried all the I tried meditation I tried", "119:44", "witnessing you know I even tried missus", "119:46", "RI just to see what it would feel like", "119:47", "how did it feel it was it turned me from", "119:50", "a pessimist to an optimist but I didn't", "119:52", "like the physical side effects nor did I", "119:54", "want to be in a drug for a sustained", "119:55", "basis mm so I dropped it and I thought", "119:57", "it'd turn you into an optimist yes at", "119:59", "the time I used to be a pessimist yeah I", "120:02", "started doing things like I would start", "120:03", "looking at the you know in every moment", "120:06", "and everything that happens you can look", "120:07", "on the bright side of something right", "120:09", "and so I used to do that forcibly and", "120:11", "then I trained it until I became second", "120:13", "nature so for example like a friend of", "120:15", "my wife's was over and she when we were", "120:18", "dating and she took all these photos she", "120:20", "took like hundreds of photos and then", "120:22", "she sends them all to us", "120:23", "and my immediate reaction was like why", "120:24", "are you dumping hundreds of photos on my", "120:26", "phone I don't need hundreds of photos", "120:28", "have some judgment that's my immediate", "120:29", "reaction and then I could say actually", "120:32", "how nice of her she sent me hundreds of", "120:34", "photos I can pick the one that I like", "120:35", "right there are two ways of seeing", "120:36", "almost everything there are a few things", "120:39", "that are like high suffering so you", "120:40", "can't do that other than just saying", "120:41", "well this is a teacher right but I", "120:43", "slowly work through every negative", "120:45", "judgement that I had until I saw the", "120:47", "positive and not second nature to me I", "120:49", "also realized that like what you want is", "120:52", "you want to clear minds you want to let", "120:54", "go of thoughts happy thoughts disappear", "120:56", "out ahead automatically very easy to let", "120:58", "go of them negative thoughts linger so", "121:00", "if you interpret the negative the", "121:01", "positive and everything very quickly you", "121:04", "let it go right you let it go much",

your", "121:22", "mind watch your mind all day long watch", "121:24", "what it does not judge it and I try to", "121:26", "control it but you can meditate 24/7", "121:28", "meditation is not a sit down close your", "121:30", "eyes activity meditation is just", "121:32", "basically watching your own thoughts", "121:34", "like you would watch anything else in", "121:36", "the outside world and say why am I", "121:38", "having that thought does that serve me", "121:40", "anymore is that conditioning from when I", "121:41", "was ten years old like for example I'm", "121:45", "getting ready for this podcast", "121:47", "you got ready I didn't all right good I", "121:49", "did but I did but I did I couldn't help", "121:52", "it and what happened was the few days", "121:54", "leading up to this my mind was just", "121:56", "running and normally my mind is pretty", "121:58", "calm it was just running and running and", "121:59", "running and every thought I would have", "122:02", "I would imagine me saying it to you my", "122:04", "brain couldn't help but rehearse what", "122:07", "what is doing is just rehearsing all the", "122:09", "time to talk to you and then I was even", "122:11",

calms you down so after that I", "122:49", "stopped rehearsing as much Wow but it", "122:52", "still a trained habit that is a really", "122:55", "interesting point that you want to sound", "122:58",
