["00:00", "the Joe Rogan experience do you watch", "00:03", "those movies and shake your head I like", "00:05", "him yeah I like science fiction you know", "00:08", "so yeah and it's it there I grew up with", "00:10", "Star Wars", "00:11", "that was my when I was nine years old us", "00:13", "and finally yeah I'm not having this I", "00:17", "did an arguing with Neil deGrasse Titan", "00:20", "on argument but debate with him about", "00:21", "lightsabers ones because I claimed that", "00:24", "they're physically part that in", "00:25", "principle they're possible and and he", "00:27", "was trying to say that they aren't but", "00:29", "they are would they'd have to loop back", "00:31", "around cuz the lights not continuing it", "00:33", "like the fact that it goes to a certain", "00:35", "distance and pauses well yet have a", "00:37", "mirror or something I guess yes", "00:39", "something that's pretty the end of it", "00:40", "that's true so it wouldn't it be a", "00:41", "different kind of light saying that the", "00:43", "only point I was making is that photons", "00:45", "particles of light can bounce off each", "00:47", "other hmm", "00:48", "so we see that in really high energy", "00:50", "experiments in particle accelerators we", "00:52", "can collide photons together so my point", "00:55", "was a bit of a pedantic physicist one", "00:58", "but he's because he it is true that", "01:00", "light can bounce off it it can hit light", "01:02", "right but very very high-energy but when", "01:06", "they press their body to a certain", "01:08", "distance I wasn't that's engineering", "01:11", "right I agree with you I agree with you", "01:13", "the distance things I pass to it right", "01:17", "so as you're swinging it around you", "01:19", "wouldn't have the leverage of a long", "01:22", "thing so why not make it really long", "01:24", "because it wouldn't be difficult to", "01:26", "swing around like you could stab someone", "01:29", "with a lightsaber a mile away that's", "01:31", "true well that's just a laser and yes", "01:34", "like why make it so short yes", "01:37", "you have to swing you have to be close", "01:39", "to any person with it yes silly silly", "01:42", "design you are picking holes correctly", "01:45", "in the engineering part of my haha oh", "01:47", "the only point I was making is the", "01:49", "physics is that which i think is quite", "01:51", "interesting his light can bounce off", "01:54", "light yes that's the fun so but it would", "01:56", "have to there would have to be something", "01:57", "that causes it to stop at the very end", "02:00", "yeah yeah yeah which would be your right", "02:03", "it haven't merit but he wouldn't look", "02:04", "cool with it if there was a no kind of", "02:06", "thing with him what drives me crazy", "02:08", "about Star Wars is not the lightsabers", "02:11", "it's the lasers when they're shooting", "02:13", "the", "02:13", "I'm like why can I see that well I can't", "02:16", "see bullets yeah this is we're supposed", "02:18", "to be way faster than a bullet yeah why", "02:21", "is it easy to see this because it's like", "02:22", "you could duck they really sly wrong", "02:26", "yeah how so angry I feel like this is so", "02:30", "dumb I could go warp speed in this", "02:31", "Millennium Falcon and travel the speed", "02:34", "of light but for whatever reason these", "02:36", "lasers are so slow that you could duck", "02:38", "out of the way of them that's so dumb", "02:39", "and it's not only Star Wars it's", "02:40", "everything the epigenome is quite", "02:42", "difficult different the epigenome is", "02:44", "that the structure of how the DNA is", "02:46", "looped around if you look at the", "02:48", "chromosome you're not seeing the genome", "02:50", "you'll really basically seeing epigenome", "02:52", "and what what I think is causing aging", "02:54", "is not that you're losing the DNA", "02:57", "structure you're not having mutations", "02:59", "you're actually changing the epigenome", "03:02", "which is the the reader of the genes so", "03:05", "put another way compact disk okay", "03:08", "for the young audience compact discs are", "03:11", "little things we used to put music on", "03:12", "but anyway these are these are digital", "03:15", "information of course and the reason we", "03:16", "switch to digital in the first place is", "03:18", "that it's very copyable and it doesn't", "03:20", "wear out whereas a cassette tape you", "03:24", "know people our age know that if you try", "03:26", "to copy that a thousand times there's", "03:27", "not much left at the end so the the", "03:30", "compact disc information is the genome", "03:33", "the epigenome is the reader of the CD", "03:35", "that little laser that goes around and", "03:37", "what I think is causing aging is not the", "03:40", "loss of the digital information but it's", "03:43", "the reader at the analog part and that's", "03:45", "like a cassette tape that eventually", "03:47", "runs out what we what's going on really", "03:50", "is that your cells are losing the", "03:52", "ability to read the right genes the way", "03:55", "they did when you were 20", "03:56", "and that's basically noise informational", "04:00", "noise that gathers over time and so what", "04:03", "we end up with when we're 80 is a", "04:05", "compact disc or DVD that's scratched so", "04:08", "the reader cannot read the right genes", "04:09", "at right time and the cells become", "04:11", "dysfunctional now what we're working on", "04:13", "is how do you polish that CD or that DVD", "04:15", "to get that information back again and", "04:18", "if you can do that I think that's really", "04:20", "the best way to reset your age and I we", "04:24", "haven't polished it yet but", "04:26", "we're working on ways to actually reset", "04:27", "that genome and actually get back the", "04:31", "information that we once had when we", "04:32", "were 20 so what is happening to the", "04:34", "epigenome when you're going through", "04:35", "those scanners well so what we found is", "04:38", "the biggest disruptor of the epigenome", "04:40", "is a a broken chromosome DNA break and I", "04:45", "don't know about scanners that's just a", "04:46", "abundance of caution but an x-ray will", "04:48", "damage your DNA no question even going", "04:52", "out in the Sun will do a bit of that and", "04:54", "we think that the cells reaction to that", "04:56", "break having to unwrap the DNA from its", "04:59", "chromatin we call it and up and then", "05:02", "rewrap it is what eventually disrupts", "05:04", "the ability to read the right gene at", "05:07", "the right place so DNA damage is", "05:08", "essentially a little scratch on on the", "05:11", "DVD and that accumulates over time a lot", "05:14", "of people are not willing to learn how", "05:16", "to do that because they want the fast", "05:17", "track out yeah so that is the thing", "05:21", "right they just want to pill", "05:22", "yeah it's very unfortunate that those", "05:24", "things exist in that that that sort of", "05:26", "thinking is you know it's reinforced", "05:31", "yeah yeah it's encouraged in fact you", "05:34", "know you all these ads and all these", "05:36", "doctors and different people well if you", "05:39", "have a hard time sleeping I'll just", "05:40", "write your prescription yeah and", "05:42", "actually you know and I mean you look at", "05:44", "the animal world like they self-medicate", "05:46", "they'll use clay for parasites and you", "05:49", "know dogs will eat grass for stomach", "05:50", "issues and you know that I guess birds", "05:53", "now are putting like nicotine and", "05:55", "cigarettes and their nests because", "05:56", "there's some kind of benefit to that and", "05:58", "you see animals self-medicating you see", "06:01", "our ancestors using everything from you", "06:04", "know cannabis to Ceylon cinnamon to you", "06:07", "know all sorts of different derivatives", "06:08", "for thousands of years so it's not like", "06:10", "supplementation or self medication or", "06:13", "the whole creation of pharmaceuticals is", "06:15", "something that's unnatural or not", "06:17", "acceptable human activity but once you", "06:19", "start to use it as a crutch I think", "06:22", "that's where you run into issues like", "06:23", "once once you deny the human body's", "06:25", "ability to be able to heal itself or to", "06:28", "be able to decrease stress on its own", "06:30", "you begin to rely on these exogenous", "06:32", "chemicals I think that's where you start", "06:34", "playing with fire the idea that you're", "06:35", "going to be this balanced chilled out", "06:37", "person and still be a fucking world", "06:39", "smash", "06:39", "sure good luck with that I'm the", "06:41", "farthest thing from relaxed and chill", "06:44", "right now but yeah but when you're", "06:46", "training and when you look you there's a", "06:48", "mindset that's required to beat the best", "06:50", "guys and it's not the same mindset", "06:52", "that's required to get good to get you", "06:55", "could get good and be a chilled out", "06:56", "relaxed person let's say you want to be", "06:58", "a black belt in jujitsu that's totally", "07:00", "possible yeah you can be really good", "07:02", "people can go hey look at Mike man Mike", "07:03", "has got great triangle watch him roll", "07:05", "wow he's really good", "07:06", "but if mike wants to be the motherfucker", "07:08", "of motherfuckers you better be crazy you", "07:10", "know you better be goddamn crazy you", "07:12", "better be like Mike Tyson when he was", "07:13", "young", "07:14", "yeah Beto's Michael Jordan's you talking", "07:16", "about they're always thinking about it", "07:17", "Roy Jones jr. yes all those guys you got", "07:19", "to be a fucking crazy person absolutely", "07:22", "everyone's Roy Jones jr. played a", "07:23", "professional basketball game the day of", "07:25", "his fight played a guy in a basketball", "07:28", "game that night you can probably of dude", "07:29", "and he's just an athlete yeah yeah I", "07:32", "mean I just don't think there's any", "07:33", "other way I mean I think if you're gonna", "07:36", "win a race you're gonna have redline the", "07:38", "engine is I just don't see how you're", "07:41", "gonna beat the best guy everybody is", "07:43", "trying their best yeah this is the thing", "07:45", "there's so much going on there I mean", "07:48", "you could have like a really good coach", "07:50", "so you have an advantage technically you", "07:52", "could have a really good group of guys", "07:54", "you train with so you have an advantage", "07:56", "in the environment that you're training", "07:57", "in and there's a lot of inspiration but", "07:59", "if you're not a fucking psychopath hmm", "08:02", "good luck yeah I know my friend sam", "08:05", "harris was trying to get you guys to ban", "08:07", "Donald Trump he was saying if they", "08:09", "follow your Terms of Service I just did", "08:11", "a podcast with him they should come out", "08:13", "today or tomorrow he's he's a", "08:16", "fascinating guy Sam Harris I love him to", "08:19", "death", "08:19", "but what he was trying to do was like", "08:21", "saying hey he's threatening nuclear war", "08:23", "like he's saying hey Korea my bombs are", "08:27", "bigger than your bombs like what else", "08:29", "does the guy have to do to get you to", "08:31", "remove him from the platform when you", "08:33", "guys saw that what was your reaction to", "08:35", "that and was there an internal", "08:37", "discussion about actually banning the", "08:39", "president United States well so the so", "08:42", "two things are one it was a context that", "08:47", "presidents of this country have used", "08:50", "similar language in different mediums", "08:53", "they use it on radio they use it on", "08:55", "television it's not just through Twitter", "08:58", "and even if you were looking you were to", "09:01", "look at the presidency of Obama there", "09:03", "wasn't exactly the same tone in this", "09:06", "exact same language but there were", "09:07", "threats around the same country and we", "09:11", "have to take that context into", "09:13", "consideration so the second thing is", "09:15", "that we need the most controversial", "09:18", "aspect of our rules and our Terms of", "09:22", "Service is probably this clause around", "09:25", "public interest in newsworthiness we're", "09:30", "powerful figures or public figures might", "09:33", "be in violation of our Terms of Service", "09:35", "but the tweet itself is of public", "09:40", "interest yes there should be a", "09:42", "conversation around it and that is", "09:46", "probably the thing that people disagree", "09:48", "with the most and where we have a lot of", "09:52", "internal debate but we also have some", "09:55", "pretty hard lines if we had a global", "09:57", "leader including the president United", "09:59", "States make a violent threat against a", "10:01", "private individual we would take action", "10:04", "we we always have to balance that with", "10:07", "like is this a is this something that", "10:09", "the public has interest in and I believe", "10:13", "generally the answer is yes it's not", "10:14", "going to be in every case but generally", "10:16", "the answer is yes because we should see", "10:19", "how our leaders think and how they act",
