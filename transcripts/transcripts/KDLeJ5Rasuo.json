thought was well", "12:08", "maybe you just I'm not a believer in", "12:11", "fate but it kind of seems to fall into", "12:14", "place for you it yeah I don't know it's", "12:19", "like I feel like my whole life is just", "12:20", "like I could have gotten hit by that car", "12:22", "I just didn't yeah cuz I just stopped", "12:25", "one second short from actually stepping", "12:27", "in front of a speeding car and made it", "12:29", "so you always wanted to make movies", "12:31", "though that was always some that was", "12:33", "always the thing I wanted to do for sure", "12:34", "but that seemed completely undoable", "12:37", "because it was just like Hollywood and", "12:40", "movies I mean it just it feels so far", "12:42", "far removed I mean living on the Lower", "12:44", "East Side playing CBGB's like and being", "12:47", "broke that seems doable like right you", "12:50", "know and that actually inspired me", "12:53", "there's I would see so many bands like", "12:54", "oh well they suck I mean we at least", "12:57", "better than they are", "12:58", "I guess the motivation I had but like", "13:01", "movies just seemed like no way that", "13:03", "works for comics too that's one of the", "13:04", "best thing Richard Jeni once said that", "13:06", "about open mic nights that really bad", "13:08", "comedians are great because they inspire", "13:10", "people to try it yeah

think it's so", "13:21", "similar", "13:22", "I can't imagine staying there trying to", "13:25", "tell jokes that people aren't laughing", "13:26", "but I also can't imagine staying there", "13:28", "playing songs that nobody wants to hear", "13:30", "and they're just looking at you like", "13:32", "yeah yeah kinda similar well the thing", "13:37", "is I think it's probably even harder", "13:38", "maybe with songs that nobody knows", "13:41", "because people will listen to jokes", "13:43", "because they make them laugh but songs", "13:45", "that that one knows in a band that no", "13:47", "one knows like man you got to figure out", "13:49", "a way to rope these people in yeah", "13:51", "that's why I always figured like I was", "13:54", "always visually oriented so I always", "13:57", "would made sure the band had a look a", "13:59", "certain way in act a certain way the way", "14:03", "I wanted them to be you know so I", "14:05", "thought at least there's that at least", "14:07", "you can go this is awful but look at", "14:09", "these maniacs wear it you know", "14:11", "everybody's hair is down here and", "14:13", "they're going crazy and no one else is", "14:15", "going crazy in the club but they are at", "14:17", "least it's you know an entertaining", "14:19", "trainwreck to watch at least you know", "14:22", "what kind of films did you like when", "14:24", "you're

"15:22", "something about having to be exposed to", "15:24", "everything because there was nothing", "15:26", "else that I know as much about John", "15:28", "Wayne movies as I do", "15:29", "about horror movies right you didn't get", "15:30", "to choose where is now everything so", "15:32", "compartmentalized that people just like", "15:34", "you guess like if you hear a band go let", "15:37", "me guess what your favorite band is the", "15:38", "band you sound exactly like because you", "15:40", "have no other influences as opposed a", "15:42", "lot of metal bands I know that are huge",
