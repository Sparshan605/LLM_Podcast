makes that weight", "08:14", "and Conor makes that weight tough too", "08:16", "they both struggled to make 155 mm it's", "08:19", "a much easier cup for counter at 55 it's", "08:22", "not the hardest cut but when you look at", "08:25", "the difference between how he looks", "08:26", "physically when he fought Nate at 170", "08:28", "and how he looks when he's you know 145", "08:30", "he was awful I was gonna say annika week", "08:33", "145 Nate couldn't have I mean there's", "08:35", "there's no chummy could have made it", "08:36", "because that fighter was a total leg off", "08:39", "you know

the difference is", "09:04", "that like max has taken on a guy that", "09:07", "everybody's avoiding no one's been able", "09:09", "to solve the riddle of khabib no one's", "09:12", "even ever even

"159:22", "in a tough position and they need a big", "159:24", "name and they're trying to recoup the", "159:26", "pay-per-views so I got them back in the", "159:28", "corner I'm on the longest win streak I'm", "159:31", "saying 4 million or bust whoo you're a", "159:33", "bold man I take two two after taxes yeah", "159:38", "that's not worth it I need a million for", "159:48", "every day so six days so you know you", "159:52", "know max can submit people but we don't", "159:55", "anticipate him submitting khabib it just", "159:57", "it seems like Kabir aplans on a higher", "160:00", "level than max it seems like the way max", "160:03", "can win this fight is by pacing because", "160:05", "max is even if max is not in shape he's", "160:08", "in phenomenal shape I mean he's just", "160:10", "he's got an incredible cardio base and", "160:13", "he really knows how to pace himself very", "160:16", "well", "160:16", "pacing if it's more of a fight and if", "160:19", "it's at his tempo yeah beep ghosts watch", "160:22", "your tempo and just throws in a blender", "160:24", "yeah he's so and it's a six day notice", "160:27", "and it's a max who's taking time off", "160:28", "spend time with his family so all the", "160:30", "chips just stacked against max all of it", "160:33", "and it's a weight class above his weight", "160:34", "class it's khabib who's a huge 155 it's", "160:38", "arguably the best grappler in the UFC", "160:42", "and the other promise he really does", "160:45", "entertain the stand up game so your", "160:47", "chance of the 1 a home run shot it's", "160:49", "even dropped even lower that's why I'm", "160:52", "saying for me did you hear what he said", "160:53", "about it he said thank you for taking", "160:56", "fight I don't think you'll ever be the", "160:58", "same again", "160:59", "oh so that FAFSA I don't think that'd be", "161:02", "the same again", "161:03", "and he's probably not lined that's a", "161:06", "hard thing to say - not just you'll", "161:09", "never be the same again", "161:11", "ah my heart did we might say I hope he's", "161:14", "wrong and you know what you know I do if", "161:16", "I was in Max's corner and if it's like", "161:18", "halfway through that second round and", "161:20", "I'm like damn max looks exhausted keys", "161:22", "not in shape he's just taking a beating", "161:24", "he's so tough he's probably last five", "161:25", "rounds I thrown that towel I'm gonna", "161:27", "take all the shit for that from the fans", "161:29", "because I don't want max dealing with", "161:30", "this because this isn't this isn't his", "161:33", "fight to be honest this isn't his fight", "161:34", "this isn't his path he's gonna make four", "161:37", "million hopefully he's gonna be set for", "161:39", "life fine answer if he's smart with his", "161:40", "money however this isn't his path we did", "161:43", "this to help out the UFC he made Bank", "161:45", "here's the towel fuck you I know you're", "161:47", "in hate me max we'll talk in Hawaii over", "161:49", "ball of you tuna that's not a bad idea", "161:52", "yeah well if we know we I think with a", "161:55", "could be fight one of the things is", "161:57", "after the first round you kind of know", "161:58", "how it's gonna go well know and split", "162:00", "the thing to format suit if he had 12", "162:02", "weeks he's a phenomenal
