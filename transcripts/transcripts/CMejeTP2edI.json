is a perfect example that", "46:55", "cat Zingano just charges out her like a", "46:57", "fucking bat out of hell and they have", "46:59", "this mad scramble and Ronda realizes a", "47:01", "position

back", "53:20", "in a weird way you feel it kind of", "53:22", "pulling and separating and then a couple", "53:24", "of seconds later you're strengthening it", "53:25", "again", "53:25", "and then you're pulling in separated and", "53:27", "you're strengthening again and then I", "53:28", "have another thing out back that I I", "53:30", "bend over from the waist on and it", "53:33", "allows my

through", "54:39", "this kind of stuff yeah I heard this I", "54:40", "did 10 years to Kobe's career and I", "54:42", "think yeah that's what he said", "54:44", "thanks yeah you know I didn't up until", "54:46", "I'm 48 how are you jack 49 almost 50 no", "54:49", "so I didn't think about any of these", "54:52", "things until this year so I accepted an", "54:54", "ACL as a bit of a nuisance except I've", "54:57", "got a bit of creaky back but in the last", "55:00", "month I went to my something happened to", "55:05", "my knee and I went to the doctor a", "55:09", "little x-ray and he went well could", "55:12", "operate for the 10th time I've had an", "55:15", "operation on that knee but you're better", "55:18", "off now waiting waiting for what till I", "55:21", "give you a new one", "55:23", "okay now so he's talking about a", "55:25", "replacement so he's talking about", "55:26", "replacement now he's saying to just hold", "55:28", "on right so you said in 15 years from", "55:30", "now or whatever it is but it all changed", "55:34", "and then a month after I went had the", "55:35", "shoulder x-rayed and he looked at it", "55:38", "went well could operate that and I knew", "55:41", "where we were going here mmm", "55:43", "you're better off wait until I give you", "55:44", "a new one arm now that geezer where", "55:46", "they're not talking about fix if they",

"the stuff and it changes constantly like", "56:20", "when I first went I first got a shot in", "56:23", "July of last year and I was that close", "56:26", "to surgery I was trying to figure okay I", "56:28", "was planning my time I was saying okay", "56:29", "if I get the surgery I essentially can't", "56:32", "use this arm for at least a few weeks", "56:34", "and it's going to be pretty weak for at", "56:36", "least three months and I was really", "56:38", "accepting that and he said well let's", "56:40", "just give this a shot and within a", "56:42", "couple of weeks of getting the shot I", "56:44", "was like goddamn this thing's feels", "56:45", "better than it's ever felt before", "56:47", "and so through a series of exercises", "56:49", "like a lot of rotator cuff strengthening", "56:52", "exercises and bottoms up kettlebells", "56:56", "like where you have to stabilize the", "56:58", "kettlebells ones those are those those", "57:00", "are fantastic for stabilization muscles", "57:02", "and then it muscle made me realize that", "57:04", "if you're going to do something along", "57:06", "the lines of jiu-jitsu something it's", "57:08", "very physically demanding you have to", "57:09", "strengthen your machine I can't you", "57:11", "can't just keep going to jiu-jitsu which", "57:13", "is what I was doing for years yeah me", "57:14", "too that was my exercise I don't think", "57:16", "that's adequate I think you have to", "57:18", "strengthen the machine and I think Yoga", "57:20", "is also a really big impart important", "57:22", "part of strengthening that machine", "57:24", "because it's lengthening its", "57:26", "decompressing the spine and it's making", "57:28", "you strong in these static positions", "57:30", "which is very similar to the load that's", "57:33", "going to be pushed on those joints and", "57:34", "on your back when you're doing jujitsu", "57:37", "I tried yoga for a year tried everyday", "57:39", "because usually I can get into anything", "57:41", "at some point or another you've got to", "57:42", "keep throwing enough hours at it the one", "57:44", "thing I can get into couldn't do it my", "57:47", "approach was wrong I was doing a", "57:49", "snuggler my ex-wife and it was", "57:52", "incredibly painful incredibly", "57:53", "challenging but what I like about a", "57:55", "fight is the competitive element of it", "57:58", "yes I come but there's my enemy I can", "57:59", "have a roll around with my enemy there's", "58:01", "a tap as winners a loser and for some", "58:02", "reason that keeps me motivated the idea", "58:05", "I mean in essence I imagine it's the", "58:09", "what I was talking about in the end", "58:11", "itself against self yes with yoga I just", "58:14", "haven't made it that far to access that", "58:20", "struggle and enjoy it I feel like I'm", "58:22", "always running on fumes with yoga yeah", "58:23", "where you're going to run on fumes but", "58:25", "it's it's building a house one layer of", "58:28", "paint at a time I mean it's it's not a", "58:30", "it's not an easy thing to do and I think", "58:32", "that competitive element that you're", "58:34", "talking about is an internal struggle", "58:36", "and that internal struggle is you and", "58:38", "your breath keeping your breath and calm", "58:41", "and check and focusing entirely on your", "58:44", "breath while managing the positions and", "58:46", "then slowly but surely developing more", "58:49", "proficiency in those positions more", "58:51", "range of motion more dexterity keep", "58:53", "going over and over again and then you", "58:55", "one day you get to a point for me it was", "58:57", "like maybe an a year and a half into", "58:59", "doing it pretty regularly while I'm like", "59:01", "okay now I can finally hold this", "59:04", "position for 30 seconds or as before I", "59:06", "literally count to ten and just try to", "59:09", "get to ten and then I'd fall down and", "59:11", "then I get back up and try again try to", "59:13", "get to ten try to get down my feet would", "59:15", "buckle my knee wouldn't be locked out", "59:17", "and then I'd try again but once you", "59:20", "develop a certain amount of proficiency", "59:21", "then you can concentrate entirely on the", "59:24", "breath and that's where the real", "59:26", "struggle is and then keeping the mind on", "59:28", "track not thinking about other bullshit", "59:31", "not think about the gist of the struggle", "59:34", "of life and all the different variables", "59:35", "that you have to deal with on a daily", "59:36", "basis thinking only of the breath the", "59:39", "posture and the breath very difficult to", "59:41", "keep on track so that in Varian that's", "59:44", "the competitive struggle it's in your", "59:46", "own mind see a consistency with a theme", "59:47", "though that theme is this", "59:49", "that that's all there is is the outside", "59:52", "world and the noise and what comes with", "59:55", "that and there's the internal self but", "59:57", "everything is everything is subject to", "60:00", "these rules yeah", "60:02", "and yoga in this sense is no different", "60:04", "jiu-jitsu is no different narrative is", "60:06", "no different it's being aware of what", "60:09", "the dynamic is it's being aware of", "60:11", "what's actually going on that I think is", "60:13", "fundamental yes yes and pattern", "60:15", "recognition recognizing that it's the", "60:18", "same for yoga it is for the essence of a", "60:21", "narrative absolutely yeah and those", "60:23", "things become a vehicle for developing", "60:25", "your human potential", "60:26", "whether it's yoga or whether it's", "60:27", "jiu-jitsu and I think pattern", "60:29", "recognition it's they take place in both", "60:31", "things in yoga you go okay I've been", "60:33", "here before I know where this is I know", "60:35", "I know what to do and you go right back", "60:36", "into that thing of concentrating on", "60:38", "controlling the breath these big long", "60:40", "deep breaths and these big long exhales", "60:43", "and then though the focus is entirely on", "60:45", "the breath and those patterns they come", "60:47", "up in jiu-jitsu as well I mean that that", "60:49", "ability to maintain breath mean I'm sure", "60:51", "you recognize that in a person who just", "60:53", "starts like one of the things you see", "60:55", "about someone who's just started even if", "60:57", "they're athletic they don't know what", "60:58", "they're doing they start", "60:59", "hyperventilating they don't know what to", "61:00", "do they start breathing weird and they", "61:02", "the breath is like the first thing that", "61:04", "you lose control over and Hickson from", "61:06", "the movie choke I mean that was the big", "61:08", "thing that separated Hickson from all", "61:10", "the other Jitsu players is yoga", "61:12", "yeah his yoga he made yoga sexy yeah", "61:15", "yeah he did well he was the first guy to", "61:17", "make it appealing at all to martial", "61:19", "artists and we know is with your wife", "61:21", "did that's what your mom does it's what", "61:23", "the Housewives do it's not something", "61:25", "that a man does especially not the top", "61:28", "jujitsu killer ever it was a seminal it", "61:31", "was a seminal documentary that yeah it", "61:33", "changed a lot of people's lives and it", "61:35", "sort of turned Hickson into a rock star", "61:37", "oh yeah yeah yeah I've had in Minh here", "61:40", "he's a he's an amazing guy to talk to", "61:42", "I've had him I've talked to him several", "61:44", "times but having him in here and sitting", "61:47", "down with him and talking to him about", "61:48", "jujitsu it's like it's like the it's", "61:50", "like sitting down with Michelangelo and", "61:52", "talking about art I mean you're talking", "61:54", "about in did this there's masters and", "61:57", "then there's the master of the Masters", "61:59", "and if you talk to any jujitsu master", "62:01", "they all just go Hicks", "62:03", "is the number one like there's no", "62:04", "dispute which is amazing there's there's", "62:07", "very few like there's soccer players", "62:09", "that are just elite and there's", "62:11", "basketball players that are elite but", "62:13", "when it comes to like who's the best in", "62:16", "jiu-jitsu there was always this one guy", "62:19", "and while he was competitive and", "62:21", "especially while he was young it was", "62:22", "always Hickson which is to me amazing", "62:25", "that he was able to maintain and I think", "62:27", "one of the things about him was his", "62:30", "physicality and his mind I think those", "62:33", "two things in many ways were enhanced by", "62:36", "yoga I think he's got some disk issues", "62:38", "now that isn't it has a quite a few", "62:40", "here's quite a few yeah I think he has", "62:42", "eight bulging discs which is horrific", "62:44", "maybe you should send him to your man oh", "62:46", "I'm going to 100% I mean I've talked to", "62:48", "Hicks about a bunch of things Hickson", "62:50", "knows a bit reluctant for certain kinds", "62:53", "of treatment you know I mean he's he's", "62:55", "just gonna eat mangoes and fucking", "62:57", "meditate and shit I don't know I don't", "63:00", "know what he's a what he's a what he's", "63:02", "tried or what he's willing to try but I", "63:04", "would love to see him I mean I would", "63:06", "love to see him rolling again I mean it", "63:08", "would it be amazing if they could", "63:09", "regenerate this tissue to the point", "63:11", "where he would be healthy I mean that's", "63:14", "the fear the fear for the first time for", "63:16", "me is that I've never felt any version", "63:18", "of age on the mat when people are", "63:21", "starting to tell me oh we're not gonna", "63:23", "fix it we're gonna wait until we give", "63:24", "you a new one okay no doughnuts I love", "63:26", "this mate and when they're saying that", "63:28", "about your knee was the issues at a", "63:29", "meniscus issue um it is a meniscus issue", "63:33", "but I've lost 75% of the meniscus of the", "63:35", "cartilage oh I get confused between two", "63:38", "different cartilage a meniscus what is", "63:39", "the different cartilage is what covers", "63:41", "the outside of the bone meniscus is the", "63:44", "padding essentially that's in between", "63:46", "the two bones that keeps them from", "63:48", "touching each other right okay so they", "63:51", "have both so it goes bone meniscus no", "63:54", "bone cartilage cartilage - yes right", "63:56", "yeah and the meniscus you can cut some", "63:59", "of it out but when you didn't I've had", "64:01", "that done um mine left knee they they", "64:04", "did a you know they go in", "64:06", "arthroscopically and they trim some of", "64:07", "the torn meniscus yeah it's it's it", "64:10", "works but it's less stable there's less", "64:13", "tissue in there it's more subject to in", "64:16", "nation and swelling it doesn't handle", "64:18", "the load as well but I got stem-cell", "64:20", "shot into there and I've never had a", "64:22", "problem since it's amazing I had a", "64:24", "problem with it for I mean I tore it for", "64:26", "the first time more than 20 years ago", "64:30", "and had an operation I think in 95", "64:33", "somewhere around there and then I had", "64:36", "another operation on it in 2001-2002 and", "64:40", "it was it's always been an issue since", "64:41", "then it's just one of those things that", "64:42", "he gets sore I just deal with it whether", "64:45", "it's kickboxing or whether it's lifting", "64:47", "weights or whether it's jiu-jitsu it", "64:48", "gets sore I just deal with it I you know", "64:50", "take glucosamine and chondroitin and a", "64:53", "lot of fish oil and anti-inflammatories", "64:56", "and changing my diet helped quite a bit", "64:57", "but it was always that thing until they", "65:00", "shot the stem cells in there and then", "65:02", "literally within a few months it's", "65:04", "non-existent like I don't think I have", "65:06", "this knee that acts up anymore now I", "65:08", "have a knee that never acts out it just", "65:09", "doesn't bother me anymore this is very", "65:11", "exciting stuff it's very exciting stuff", "65:13", "and tell me how thin on the wedge are we", "65:16", "in terms of this being you well they've", "65:20", "been doing it and experimenting with it", "65:22", "for a couple of decades apparently", "65:23", "according to doctor McGee but the", "65:25", "understanding of the potentials and the", "65:27", "possibilities and then the practical", "65:29", "application is over the last ten years", "65:31", "has really come to the forefront it's", "65:34", "really become something very very viable", "65:36", "it's not just theoretical anymore now", "65:38", "they're actually seeing people", "65:39", "regenerating tissue they're seeing", "65:42", "people where you have a tear and like", "65:44", "your shoulder something like that and", "65:45", "they're going probably gonna have to get", "65:46", "surgery no then they shoot it in there", "65:48", "and then next thing you know it a couple", "65:50", "months later I mean I still got some", "65:51", "floating tissue that like pops and", "65:54", "crunches and stuff in my shoulder but", "65:56", "when it comes to like the actual", "65:57", "strength in my shoulder I don't worry", "65:58", "about it at all like it doesn't bother", "66:00", "me I mean there's there's occasionally", "66:02", "some slight soreness but as far as like", "66:05", "the functional strength of the shoulder", "66:07", "it's like 100% it's crazy so is this the", "66:11", "thin end of the wedge then so is this", "66:13", "good a is this going to turn into one of", "66:16", "those exponential yes it is oh for sure", "66:19", "for sure they're already generating they", "66:21", "built this woman this is very exciting", "66:23", "stuff exciting it's as exciting as it", "66:24", "gets", "66:25", "yeah the regenerating tissue the", "66:26", "regenerating body parts they built this", "66:29", "woman a bladder", "66:29", "she had a big took skin cells stem cells", "66:32", "from her skin and they with a pea in a", "66:35", "petri dish they started this off and", "66:37", "then built her a but she had bladder", "66:38", "cancer and they built her a bladder and", "66:41", "then put it in her body and it's", "66:42", "functional it's amazing I mean this is", "66:46", "all state-of-the-art now and when we're", "66:48", "looking at like 10 20 30 years from now", "66:51", "I mean you're looking at potentially", "66:52", "regenerating all sorts of things", "66:54", "regenerating bone for people have bone", "66:56", "cancer regenerating lungs and liver and", "67:00", "spleen and heart I mean they're going to", "67:02", "be able to make body parts they've", "67:03", "created an artificial heart that beats", "67:06", "like with stem cells they've actually", "67:08", "constructed a human heart this is a", "67:12", "subject you know something about", "67:14", "fascinated by it fascinated by it", "67:16", "because what what they're able to do now", "67:19", "is just uh you know you're just looking", "67:21", "into the future you get a window into", "67:23", "this and it seems like it's", "67:25", "exponentially exploding I mean all over", "67:28", "the world is people experimenting with", "67:29", "this stuff and trying to figure out new", "67:31", "ways to improve things with just the", "67:33", "fact I'm having the conversation and", "67:34", "this isn't the first conversation I've", "67:36", "had in the last month about this yeah", "67:38", "it's part design cos no oh it is now", "67:41", "people are understanding it and people", "67:42", "know people that have had issues with
