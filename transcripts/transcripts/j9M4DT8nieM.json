to", "07:50", "recall that word and use it cannot", "07:52", "remember it but what's the mechanism", "07:53", "like what is happening in your mind", "07:55", "where it switches things around yeah I",

like", "08:07", "I came up with a better word for that", "08:12", "the way it is with all that stuff but", "08:15", "it's like I got a lisp there's an S in", "08:18", "there it's like so so you is there", "08:26", "anybody that like I mean there's the", "08:28", "James Randi challenge right famously", "08:30", "word which I was in charge of the", "08:32", "million dollars and I tested many", "08:33", "psychics well I guess what I should do", "08:35", "is probably were in charge of it how so", "08:36", "yeah well let's go back to my beginning", "08:38", "so you understood how I got here on this", "08:40", "journey oh that's okay yeah all right", "08:42", "and I'll talk about a couple of personal", "08:44", "things in the very beginning so I was", "08:46", "born in 1960 so I'm 58 years old and you", "08:49", "know it's", "08:49", "yeah and I was born in England left", "08:53", "there and came to the United States my", "08:55", "mom divorced my dad in that year went", "08:56", "back to England and I'm giving you this", "08:58", "so you understand where I'm coming from", "09:00", "and how I got on this journey uh she had", "09:03", "two kids we emigrated to South Africa in", "09:06", "1969 she abandoned me in South Africa at", "09:08", "that time with my two brothers a year", "09:09", "and three years old we had a stepfather", "09:11", "was an alcoholic we saw it maybe on", "09:12", "Sundays maybe if I dragged him in from", "09:14", "the car into the house we would see him", "09:16", "then so I was changing diapers I was", "09:17", "taking care of my brothers and so forth", "09:19", "Wow", "09:20", "uh and I was there until I was fifteen", "09:23", "years old now it was during that time", "09:24", "that I I heard a guy by the name Arry", "09:26", "Geller who was a famous psychic and he's", "09:29", "the first one to claim that he could", "09:31", "actually bend objects with his mind like", "09:33", "silverware and became really famous for", "09:34", "it he was supposedly they did research", "09:36", "with him at standard Stanford research", "09:38", "it's ended Stanford Stanford Research", "09:41", "Institute and he was using that sort of", "09:44", "it as an endorsement to say that he was", "09:45", "genuine and one of the things that gala", "09:47", "did was he said if you bring metal", "09:49", "objects to the radio you can get them to", "09:52", "bend as well so I mean think about my", "09:54", "radio there was no City there at the", "09:59", "time they had Springbok TV they didn't", "10:02", "have the actual station but they were", "10:03", "putting it up and they had TVs in the", "10:06", "store at the time but they were playing", "10:07", "Pop Eye VHS movies back then you know uh", "10:10", "however they played it back then but no", "10:12", "TV station so that was the thing", "10:13", "everybody there listened to the radio", "10:15", "and he's like if you bring it to the", "10:17", "radio you can do it with the Unleashed", "10:19", "powers of your mind you can get metal", "10:20", "and so I went around a house I found a", "10:22", "little pin in my mom's old sewing kit", "10:25", "and I held it up and I looked at it and", "10:27", "I said it and I concentrated on it and", "10:30", "it bent well on a micro-level at least I", "10:32", "thought it bent so I convinced myself", "10:34", "that had bent minutely", "10:36", "and I don't think that years later but", "10:38", "in my mind I had got that to happen from", "10:41", "there I went to Australia to go be with", "10:43", "my biological dad and from there to", "10:46", "Colorado and it was while I was in", "10:47", "Colorado that I picked up a book by", "10:48", "James the amazing Randi and that book", "10:52", "said the truth about your together in", "10:54", "fact the book was changed the name was", "10:55", "changes later to the truth about you the", "10:57", "truth of Uri Geller from the magic of", "10:59", "Uri Geller and that book basically said", "11:02", "that", "11:03", "was a magician posing as a psychic and", "11:05", "no adult had ever told me that before", "11:07", "all the adults that I did know they", "11:10", "believed in early so I believed in his", "11:11", "one I learned a valuable lesson just", "11:12", "because people in a position of", "11:14", "authority because they're adults that", "11:15", "older than you doesn't make everything", "11:17", "they say correct which I learned that", "11:19", "collects it that way because keep in", "11:21", "mind I was really socially inept because", "11:24", "I was always taking care of my brothers", "11:25", "I had no free time so I wasn't hanging", "11:26", "out with other kids I wasn't doing those", "11:28", "things I had a great life don't get me", "11:29", "wrong I had a really great life in South", "11:31", "Africa I did stupid stuff by jumping off", "11:33", "bridges into trains this when we get", "11:35", "apples we would have apples to eat at", "11:37", "home and stuff like that jump off the", "11:38", "train take it home so those are great", "11:41", "things those are great times actually", "11:43", "believe even though it sounds like it's", "11:44", "really sad it's not so anyway I read", "11:46", "this book and in the book Randi sort of", "11:50", "mentions alludes to a method for bending", "11:53", "a nail and so I picked I got some nails", "11:56", "I started creating my own ways I'm sort", "11:58", "of a problem solver I can you give me", "12:00", "something you want to do and I can go", "12:02", "ahead and figure out a way to do it it's", "12:04", "why I work for people like Criss Angel", "12:05", "and you know David Blaine open his", "12:07", "second TB especially with one of my", "12:08", "effects and I'm the first person to be", "12:10", "buried alive six feet on the ground", "12:12", "chained and handcuffed in a coffin and", "12:14", "dig my way to the surface which I've", "12:16", "done twice and almost died twice doing", "12:18", "that but anyway getting back on track", "12:20", "yes so I'll get back to that later", "12:22", "yeah so I really hear about that so I", "12:24", "can't just gloss over that sir I'll", "12:26", "gloss over a whole bunch of I've done", "12:29", "crazy crazy stuff where I should be dead", "12:31", "I look back now and I go I am really", "12:34", "like I mean even when I was a kid I was", "12:35", "crawling down just just to do it I'd", "12:37", "look out the top storey window and I'd", "12:39", "go I think I can follow him down that", "12:40", "drainpipe", "12:41", "I think I can do it upside down and I", "12:42", "would actually climb upside down using", "12:44", "my feet to keep myself up there and I'm", "12:46", "down the drainpipe to get down so I did", "12:48", "a lot of dump dump them stuff um so I", "12:51", "was in high school and I started", "12:52", "creating methods for a bending silver so", "12:55", "much so that all the kids there went to", "12:57", "plastics I'll be in that school actually", "12:59", "went to plastic silverware cuz all the", "13:00", "kids in there we're bringing all their", "13:01", "silverware to me so we're getting low in", "13:03", "silverware they went to plastic", "13:05", "silverware I got in trouble you were", "13:07", "bending the silverware with your mind is", "13:09", "that what you're saying well I was", "13:10", "making it music I was using tricks to", "13:13", "make it look like", "13:14", "was bending it with my money I was cray", "13:15", "I was basically doing what gala was", "13:17", "doing only the difference was is I", "13:19", "didn't realize it until I saw Geller I", "13:22", "was I'd never seen gala work I just", "13:24", "heard about him on the radio", "13:26", "and I heard you're supposed to see the", "13:27", "metalbend so in my mind the effects that", "13:30", "I created to bend metal you actually saw", "13:32", "the forks and the spoons and that", "13:34", "bending and if you see any magician", "13:35", "working today", "13:36", "more than likely they're using a couple", "13:38", "of my techniques to make metal look like", "13:40", "it's actually bending I even figured a", "13:43", "way to make the school bell go off so we", "13:44", "could get out of school early I got", "13:45", "suspended for that why'd you do that", "13:46", "because I could know how oh how did you", "13:49", "do that", "13:50", "there was a there was a wire and there", "13:52", "was a short that goes through this one", "13:53", "classroom that I was in and I was able", "13:55", "to figure out how to exactly how to get", "13:57", "that short to work so the bell would go", "13:58", "off and we got out of school and it was", "14:00", "just connecting the two and it's like", "14:01", "you don't connect you connect and it", "14:03", "goes off so it was like oh okay this is", "14:05", "great and God with the clock up on the", "14:07", "wall if you look at a clock I realize", "14:09", "that as the clock hand goes around all", "14:13", "the way around it looks like it's", "14:14", "slowing down when it comes back up it's", "14:16", "not it's just an optical illusion from", "14:18", "one side so I would make kids think that", "14:20", "I was making the clock slowed down and I", "14:22", "figured a way on an old timing Timex", "14:23", "watch that I used to be out a way that", "14:25", "if I pulled the stem out and slowly", "14:27", "turned it backwards and pushed it in the", "14:30", "second hand would keep moving for about", "14:32", "35 seconds and then it would just start", "14:34", "like going like click late and then it", "14:36", "would stop so I could put my watch in", "14:38", "somebody's hands so I come up with all", "14:39", "these different methods for", "14:40", "accomplishing all these different feats", "14:42", "I started learning how to do a thing", "14:44", "called muscle reading which we can talk", "14:46", "about in a little bit", "14:46", "muscle reading yeah it's like if it's an", "14:49", "old old technique that nobody uses and I", "14:51", "was really surprised that people were", "14:53", "not using but it was really really", "14:54", "popular", "14:55", "back in the late 1800s where if you if I", "15:00", "take your wrist and it's based upon the", "15:02", "ideomotor response if I take your wrist", "15:04", "and I tell

"36:10", "wristband on and I'm always asking", "36:12", "questions what's this what's that and", "36:13", "I'm always noticing things and he said", "36:14", "it was a wristband that he got from a", "36:16", "witch doctor in Africa that helps", "36:18", "protect him oh I'm starting to think", "36:20", "this might be a little easier than I", "36:22", "thought it was gonna be because going in",

"36:33", "into we we had Peter Phillips's car", "36:37", "because Mike was too young to drive a", "36:39", "rental Peter Phillip says a rental he's", "36:41", "in front of us we're following him and", "36:42", "this is this is how it all starts really", "36:44", "I'm sitting there and it's kind of like", "36:47", "me talking all the time I'm looking", "36:49", "around I'm always doing something always", "36:50", "noticing something I look in the back", "36:52", "seat and I notice there's a briefcase I", "36:53", "reach in the back and I kind of pull it", "36:56", "under the dash it's locked and to me", "36:58", "like if somebody locks something it", "37:00", "means they don't want you inside there", "37:01", "of course right but why does anyone", "37:02", "who's in there", "37:03", "Oh briefcase easily can just open the", "37:05", "lock so I pick the locks open it up", "37:07", "inside there's a whole bunch of", "37:08", "silverware so either this guy's a", "37:10", "kleptomaniac or this is a silverware", "37:12", "he's gonna be using for the experiment", "37:13", "so I start bending it all up lock the", "37:15", "briefcase put it in the back sit there", "37:18", "for about 2 more minutes", "37:19", "open up the glove compartment there's", "37:21", "some extra keys and things in the globe", "37:23", "apartment I start betting those up the", "37:25", "event is fucking keys", "37:27", "well I'm a psychic right this stuff this", "37:30", "shit happens what if he need those keys", "37:31", "and get in his house yep but I needed", "37:35", "him to be convinced I was genuine are", "37:36", "you all right so I end up looking over", "37:38", "the car keys that are hanging out the", "37:40", "keys that are hanging out on the car key", "37:41", "out of the ignition I start to reach", "37:43", "over to get them and Mike just looks at", "37:44", "me and says I think you've done enough", "37:45", "stop you know so but there's there's", "37:48", "this really interesting phenomena right", "37:49", "we knew that in the laboratory", "37:51", "everything we did at that point was", "37:53", "gonna be on a micro-level it's gonna be", "37:55", "very small because it had to be because", "37:57", "we couldn't make it look like it's a", "37:59", "trick we it had to look like minut we're", "38:02", "not just that we didn't know if they", "38:04", "were gonna be watching it's like I said", "38:05", "through one-way mirrors and things like", "38:07", "that so there's an interesting phenomena", "38:09", "at the time that was called spontaneous", "38:10", "pique and that is stuff that just", "38:12", "happened hey Pete psychokinesis pique", "38:15", "shortened to psychokinesis telekinesis", "38:17", "psychokinesis the whole thing they're", "38:19", "all the same thing so there's these", "38:21", "things just supposedly happen around", "38:24", "these psychics that can bend metal", "38:26", "mm-hmm stuff move stuffs break start", "38:28", "that so those things were the things", "38:31", "that would convince him and keep him", "38:33", "holding on even if we did a Big Bend out", "38:35", "of the laboratory but not on camera", "38:37", "that's the thing that would keep him", "38:39", "going I want to get that on film I", "38:42", "definitely want to get that on film I'm", "38:43", "gonna document that someday that's gonna", "38:45", "happen in the laboratory when we ended", "38:48", "up getting to the laboratory all the", "38:50", "students at the University were", "38:51", "extremely skeptical very very skeptical", "38:54", "but they had heard about the spontaneous", "38:55", "PK so they hid things underneath the", "38:58", "video recorders in it there was a", "39:00", "separate room and they hid all kinds of", "39:02", "things everywhere around I noticed there", "39:04", "was stuff hidden I mean why is there a", "39:06", "quarter hidden under that VCR you know", "39:07", "or is there a fork hidden behind that", "39:09", "cupboard you know it doesn't belong", "39:11", "there", "39:11", "so I started bidding up all those things", "39:13", "on lunchtime and that convinced all the", "39:16", "students that we were genuine as well Oh", "39:19", "surprised so this this I mean this this", "39:21", "this whole thing went on and on yeah", "39:23", "it's as simple as so what happened was", "39:27", "immediately Randi sent them a list of 13", "39:29", "caveats of things that we that they", "39:32", "shouldn't do and it was common-sense", "39:34", "stuff right it was stuff like don't let", "39:36", "the subjects work at the same time", "39:38", "because it could distract you", "39:40", "don't let them work with more than one", "39:41", "object at a time because they could", "39:43", "confuse you with those objects as to", "39:45", "which ones you're bending and there was", "39:46", "this whole list of different things they", "39:48", "showed the list to me and Mike and had a", "39:50", "good laugh about it and said this would", "39:52", "make you guys so uncomfortable we want", "39:54", "you to be comfortable where in reality", "39:56", "they should have followed that list", "39:58", "because oh one of the things Randi said", "40:00", "was mark everything on a micro micro and", "40:02", "a macro level so they the subjects can", "40:05", "see the macro mark but won't realise as", "40:08", "a micro mark on there as well which", "40:10", "would have helped because their idea of", "40:12", "doing a macro mark was on every fork", "40:15", "they took the fork or spoon they", "40:17", "measured it at both ends like the height", "40:19", "from the table and they measured the", "40:21", "middle of the fork from the height from", "40:22", "the table then they put a label on it on", "40:24", "a little string with a number on it and", "40:26", "that was their idea of keeping track of", "40:30", "if something had bent or not because", "40:31", "they would measure it after we", "40:33", "concentrated on it and they would then", "40:35", "remeasure it again afterwards and they", "40:37", "would say oh okay this is this has been", "40:39", "2 millimeter or two millimeters so we", "40:42", "would do things like we would say this", "40:43", "tags in my way can I take it off yeah", "40:45", "you can take it off we put it down", "40:47", "concentrate on it didn't do anything put", "40:49", "it down on the table pick up another", "40:51", "fork or a spoon say do you mind if I", "40:53", "remove this tag take it off put it down", "40:55", "concentrate on it nothing happens switch", "40:58", "the tags around on the one that was on", "41:00", "the first one - the second one the", "41:01", "second one - the first one and then put", "41:04", "the two Forks off to the side and then", "41:06", "wait - three hours later pick up one of", "41:08", "those Forks obviously not doing anything", "41:10", "with it concentrating on it say why", "41:12", "don't you measure and they would measure", "41:14", "it and the measurements had now changed", "41:16", "not realising because they never", "41:18", "measured the other one again because", "41:19", "they remesh it everything consistently", "41:21", "later on and put new tags on them every", "41:22", "single time not realizing that we just", "41:24", "simply switched Forks or as we reached", "41:27", "across the table we would lean on one of", "41:29", "the forks and then ours again later we", "41:31", "would pretend like we actually bent that", "41:32", "fork", "41:33", "so this went on I mean it went on for a", "41:35", "hundred and eighty hours over four years", "41:37", "I mean we messed with these people bad", "41:39", "we did probably some things at the time", "41:40", "that were probably illegal as well what", "41:43", "like leaving the window unlocked at the", "41:46", "laboratory going off to the club across", "41:48", "the state line coming back like about", "41:51", "four or five o'clock in the morning", "41:52", "breaking into the building", "41:54", "and bending up every single piece of", "41:56", "metal that was in the laboratory they", "41:59", "had a fucking scientists were running", "42:01", "this well this is back in the 80s oh", "42:03", "right and they had they actually had", "42:05", "this aquarii back in the eighties", "42:06", "scientists were like 80s TV really but", "42:08", "no it's true here's a sad thing right I", "42:12", "went into this thinking these people", "42:14", "were gonna be the enemy it was me", "42:17", "against them well I have to do this", "42:18", "turns out these are just really really", "42:21", "nice nice people that are very naive", "42:24", "when it comes to what psychic phenomena", "42:26", "is right well if you're a scientist most", "42:28", "likely you're not studying a whole lot", "42:31", "of liars and mentalists and magicians", "42:33", "and psychic phenomenon and you really", "42:36", "are probably trying to find out whether", "42:37", "or not it's real and maybe you believe a", "42:39", "little bit too much you don't know", "42:42", "enough yet when it came to this type of", "42:44", "phenomena but you Geller was already", "42:46", "doing that other psychics were already", "42:47", "doing it in other countries and they", "42:49", "will be invalidated as a genuine thing", "42:51", "in other countries yeah we knew like", "42:53", "geez rod over in France even north over", "42:56", "in England you know there was a lot of", "42:57", "research going on in England at the time", "42:59", "on this type of phenomena as well it was", "43:01", "a really big thing back and it was just", "43:03", "people hosing people it was little kids", "43:06", "like that here's weird thing right so", "43:08", "over in England there were I can't think", "43:10", "what the guy's name is now there was a", "43:12", "scientist so and there are a pair of", "43:14", "psychologists who was working with", "43:15", "little kids and his thinking is that", "43:17", "kids don't lie", "43:18", "little kids don't lie that's all they do", "43:19", "is lie they get to that point where they", "43:21", "learn how to lie to get anything kids", "43:23", "don't lie that's someone without kids", "43:25", "and these kids only got caught the only", "43:27", "reason they got caught was by accident", "43:29", "because they were the video cameras were", "43:31", "left on and soon as a parapsychologist", "43:32", "left the room the kids were taking forks", "43:34", "and spoons and actually bending them", "43:36", "underneath their feet and then putting", "43:37", "him back up on on the table so they", "43:40", "would come in it was they literally", "43:42", "scientists went in with the premise that", "43:44", "children don't lie that is one of the", "43:46", "dumbest fucking things I've ever heard", "43:48", "in my life don't disagree with you but", "43:49", "this is how badly people wanted to", "43:51", "believe in this phenomena well I did why", "43:53", "do people want to believe in hidden", "43:55", "powers I think it's why people want to", "43:57", "believe in most things right I mean we", "44:00", "want to find we want to believe there's", "44:01", "something more than just us like that", "44:03", "for most people we're just we're not", "44:04", "enough", "44:05", "and I don't know if it's because we get", "44:08", "so bored without lies we get depressed", "44:10", "with our lives we get you know we're in", "44:12", "this everyday thing of going to work", "44:13", "coming home and it's is this all there", "44:15", "is is this it you know is there", "44:17", "something else that that's a superpower", "44:19", "that I could I could actually have is", "44:21", "there something I can discover that's", "44:23", "bigger than me better than me you know", "44:25", "this is a universe much bigger than just", "44:27", "this planet right here right so I mean", "44:30", "if you asked me I would think that if a", "44:32", "UFOs were coming here if they were", "44:34", "coming here let's say I don't believe", "44:35", "they were but if they were coming here", "44:37", "you don't believe they were I know I", "44:38", "died what I think if they were I just", "44:40", "don't I I don't I think we would really", "44:43", "have real evidence hundred-percent", "44:45", "evidence of it by now but here's the", "44:47", "thing right wouldn't it make much sense", "44:49", "even like for us okay let's say we start", "44:51", "going looking at other planets are we", "44:53", "gonna send other humans out there or are", "44:56", "we gonna go ahead and send robots or", "44:58", "something like that they can last March", "45:00", "yeah and robots are getting better

"100:15", "he's the world's greatest magician but", "100:18", "he's got to be careful with that because", "100:19", "he sued people who said that he was a", "100:21", "magician everything else it is my", "100:23", "opinion from everything that I've seen", "100:25", "and the times that I've watched him that", "100:28", "he is cheating and he is using tricks", "100:30", "and I know for a fact he uses some of my", "100:35", "methods now as well I also know when I", "100:39", "was working on the show phenomenon um", "100:41", "the first time I told this story ever", "100:45", "so on the I

and Geller calls me out of the blue", "100:56", "which was really unexpected because I've", "100:58", "always been on the other side of the", "100:59", "fence of gala you know with Randy and", "101:01", "The Skeptical movement in that and he", "101:05", "calls me up and he says hey check you", "101:07", "know how you doing I said I'm doing good", "101:08", "he says well you know you're known as", "101:10", "the guy that creates this stuff you know", "101:11", "every mentalists working today is using", "101:13", "a couple of your effects that you've", "101:14", "created um and he says you know I only", "101:17", "have like four or five powers that I've", "101:18", "had through the years and if anybody", "101:21", "could come up with a new psychic ability", "101:22", "for me it would be you hmm", "101:25", "and I went wow how ballsy is that all", "101:28", "right he's calling sort of like one of", "101:30", "his whole thing to your folks she's", "101:31", "hoping no he's hoping I can create a new", "101:34", "trick for him", "101:35", "that he can tell the Wold is psychic", "101:37", "right but he's also must be hoping that", "101:39", "you're not gonna expose him well this is", "101:41", "the great thing right like even right", "101:43", "now when I'm saying this this is when", "101:45", "you hang up you know I go why would he", "101:47", "do that I thought well it was just a", "101:49", "phone call between me and him he knows I", "101:51", "wasn't expecting it so I'm not recording", "101:52", "him it's my word against his word and he", "101:56", "could say that I misunderstood that", "101:58", "maybe he wanted me to me to come up with", "102:01", "an idea of something for him to use his", "102:04", "psychic powers so there's many ways he", "102:05", "could spin it when we worked with Criss", "102:07", "Angel Chris on one of his episodes had", "102:09", "Gellar on there and Chris put a spoon on", "102:12", "the table and he said you know can you", "102:14", "can you bend that and Yuri said no he", "102:16", "said well why not he said well my", "102:18", "abilities aren't working writing so so", "102:19", "if you bent it right now it would be a", "102:20", "trick right and ER he said well I can't", "102:23", "bend it right now he said well if you", "102:24", "did bend it would be a trick right and", "102:26", "yellow says well yeah if I bent it right", "102:28", "now it would be a trick and Chris is", "102:30", "like got him I got him you know and when", "102:33", "he walked her said you don't have him he", "102:34", "said well what do you mean he just said", "102:36", "it was a trick I said no he never said", "102:37", "it was a trick he said if he had to do", "102:38", "it in that moment it would be a trick", "102:40", "because his psychic abilities weren't", "102:41", "working he never says he knows how to do", "102:43", "it as a trick he just said it would have", "102:44", "to be a trick sure enough I walked up", "102:46", "together later on he says you know I", "102:47", "didn't say that I used tricks right I go", "102:49", "yeah I know", "102:51", "you know he's clever he's like very very", "102:53", "clever very very slick so and I you know", "102:56", "I think he's harm science and took it", "102:58", "back and it was one of these things I", "103:00", "think why we had to do what we had to do", "103:02", "at the time because science was going in", "103:04", "this very weird pseudo science direction", "103:07", "I mean that was back in the days when", "103:08", "you had old pyramids that would", "103:11", "basically put a razor blade supposedly", "103:13", "and it was sharpness you had all the", "103:14", "period meant but how and yeah yeah I", "103:16", "don't remember that stuff put things", "103:19", "into pyramids to sharpen them yeah yeah", "103:21", "I didn't didn't work baby would just say", "103:23", "so it's all pseudoscience but it was all", "103:25", "this you know people wearing tinfoil", "103:26", "hats and yeah it's just you know the", "103:29", "whole thing went on and on and on and on", "103:31", "it was a list of just whatever happen to", "103:34", "pop off pop off from he disappeared oh", "103:39", "he's back on every night now you can", "103:40", "find him on every night now the", "103:41", "difference is this right so he was one", "103:44", "of the first ones to send out you've", "103:45", "probably seen them he would send out", "103:47", "these letters look", "103:48", "like they were handwritten it's obvious", "103:51", "now we look at we know it's not", "103:52", "handwritten you know they're printed but", "103:53", "back then you people weren't aware that", "103:55", "and it looks like it's handwritten and", "103:56", "personal to you and I would get because", "103:59", "I just signed up when I was at Wed there", "104:00", "that day I would get an outline of a", "104:03", "foot wear this in your shoe and you know", "104:06", "wrap it up with $20 $50 $100 whatever", "104:09", "you put in you'll get 10 fold back hey", "104:12", "you know you got this little piece of", "104:13", "water and it came from Bethlehem and you", "104:15", "know wear that around your neck and then", "104:17", "wrap it up with money and send that send", "104:19", "that back so he was making most of his", "104:21", "money not at the the events he was", "104:24", "making it on the mailings that's where", "104:26", "they were making really making all their", "104:28", "money took a few years for him to", "104:31", "disappear like about 3 4 years to him", "104:33", "disappear and not so much after this", "104:36", "night show yeah yeah and then he came", "104:38", "back but the difference is now he's not", "104:40", "using any of those tricks it's more of a", "104:42", "thing that he's on the air and he's", "104:44", "going somebody out there has a headache", "104:46", "right now and I'm gonna help kill you of", "104:48", "your migraines and you don't have to if", "104:50", "you just on television yeah you don't", "104:51", "have to do anything right you just at", "104:53", "the point there's a heart attack right", "104:55", "now and

percentage", "105:35", "is actually going to the cause the", "105:38", "problem a 5% when it and you can only", "105:41", "have X amount of employees at rest and", "105:42", "volunteers and the
