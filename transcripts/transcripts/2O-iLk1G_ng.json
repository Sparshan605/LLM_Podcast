assault weapons", "39:07", "uh i believe i believe it was for ten", "39:09", "years", "39:10", "uh that ban was undone by republican", "39:13", "majority", "39:15", "uh and it didn't you know i'm not", "39:17", "suggesting by the way that anything here", "39:19", "that", "39:19", "if you banned assault weapons tomorrow", "39:21", "that would radically change everything", "39:22", "but",

kids", "40:06", "going back to school you're gonna see in", "40:08", "schools all over america drills", "40:10", "all right this is what you do if", "40:11", "somebody walks into the school", "40:13",

"41:03", "year right now as we speak", "41:05", "gun manufacturers or make manufacturers", "41:07", "are making more guns", "41:08", "this is happening right now so if those", "41:10", "guns already exist it's more than enough", "41:12", "oh yeah how would you stop well again i", "41:15", "think", "41:16", "look you know i do think there should be", "41:19", "a ban on assault weapons so that means", "41:21", "that manufacturers", "41:22", "would not be able to produce or sell", "41:24", "those weapons to american citizens", "41:26", "but not to the military obviously", "41:27", "obviously

magical", "41:39", "solution but i've given you", "41:40", "i'll tell you something else that i", "41:41", "didn't mention and that is the role of", "41:43", "gun manufacturers", "41:45", "is that if

asking", "51:39", "this is a very very deep question which", "51:41", "we don't talk about terribly much", "51:44", "why is it that so many of our people are", "51:47", "turning to drugs", "51:50", "to alcohol by the way and i don't mean a", "51:52", "drink at night but i mean serious", "51:54", "alcohol problems", "51:55", "and tragically to suicide", "52:00", "we now have for the last three

become alcohol becomes", "52:47", "a way out and the worst case", "52:50", "suicide so i think what we're talking", "52:53", "about is why is this happening", "52:55", "as often in rural areas in

to", "53:50", "tell you", "53:50", "i have all the answers but there are a", "53:52", "lot of people out there who have", "53:53", "basically given", "53:54", "up hope and for those people i guess", "53:57", "drugs is", "53:58", "is the alternative so what you're saying", "54:00", "essentially is that", "54:01", "if we can do something to mitigate", "54:03", "despair then we'll do something", "54:05", "to at least stop some of the demand for", "54:09", "these illegals i believe that is the", "54:10", "case look if i am optimistic", "54:12", "if i'm excited about going to work", "54:13",
