["00:03", "sup sach hey how's it going good man how", "00:06", "are you good good thanks for having me", "00:07", "back on my pleasure hey um thanks for", "00:09", "turning me on to those shoes you were to", "00:10", "those ultras oh nice I started running", "00:12", "with those yeah I like them I like them", "00:14", "a lot they're great uh-huh which ones", "00:16", "you got the Lone Peak RSM I've got the", "00:18", "whatever the trail ones are okay you", "00:19", "know I like the wide foot what's it", "00:22", "called foot box so check box yeah toe", "00:24", "box of what's called toe box yeah those", "00:27", "are great", "00:27", "cool man no I'm glad you like them and I", "00:30", "feel like this is what you wear so it", "00:31", "gets me excited you know it's really", "00:33", "interesting like when you dive into", "00:35", "under the the world of footwear and", "00:37", "stuff and I learned this recently and", "00:39", "the number one indicator of low injury", "00:43", "risk which is what runners always", "00:44", "looking for they're gonna minimize risk", "00:46", "so comfort is the identifier for that so", "00:49", "if you find yourself going into like a", "00:51", "specialty running shop ask them to try", "00:54", "on a variety of different pairs a", "00:55", "variety different models and find the", "00:56", "one that's most comfort for you and", "00:57", "that's probably gonna lower your risk to", "00:59", "the lowest you can you can get from your", "01:00", "Footwear anyway but if you like really", "01:02", "smushy ones aren't those supposed to be", "01:04", "not so good for you yeah no that's a", "01:06", "good question I think it's one of those", "01:08", "things where it's kind of half true half", "01:10", "not where you kind of have to look at", "01:12", "what you're what what's the purpose of", "01:13", "what you're doing so the way I kind of", "01:15", "describe it is if I'm trying to", "01:18", "strengthen my lower legs you know I want", "01:20", "that low cushion that firm platform", "01:22", "because that's gonna really activate the", "01:24", "muscles in the lower part of the leg but", "01:26", "if I'm dealing with some lower leg", "01:27", "issues or a little sore I did a workout", "01:29", "and my calves are kind of sore or my", "01:30", "ankles sore then cushion can be great", "01:32", "because it's gonna relieve that kind of", "01:34", "initial impact on the lower part of your", "01:36", "legs and the the caveat though is those", "01:39", "impact forces have to go somewhere so", "01:40", "they're kind of going to move further up", "01:42", "the kinetic chain so what I usually tell", "01:45", "people if you're dealing with lower leg", "01:46", "pain or injury then you might want to", "01:49", "consider something a little more", "01:50", "cushioned and if you want if you're", "01:51", "dealing with something like in your", "01:52", "knees or your hips then getting rid of", "01:54", "some of that cushion is going to just", "01:56", "keep that kind of more precise foot", "01:58", "plant and maybe alleviate some of those", "02:00", "impact forces from ending up in those", "02:01", "areas but at the end of the day the", "02:04", "mechanics of it all are going to be the", "02:05", "real driver you want your foot to come", "02:07", "underneath the bent knee because you're", "02:09", "using your legs that's kind of like a", "02:10", "three-foot spring essentially so if you", "02:12", "can get that foot plant under bent", "02:13", "it's gonna absorb it in the way your", "02:15", "body intends versus absorbing it in a", "02:17", "way that could maybe send those impact", "02:18", "forces into the wrong areas that's", "02:20", "really interesting you know I was", "02:21", "watching a video with this guy who was", "02:24", "in his 70s who runs in under three hour", "02:26", "marathon yeah and he said that five", "02:29", "years ago he hired a coach it was just", "02:31", "kind of crazy like a 65 year old dude", "02:33", "hiring a coach but trimmed a bunch of", "02:36", "time off his marathon I think more than", "02:38", "five minutes off of his marathon I think", "02:40", "it was quite a bit more than five", "02:41", "minutes and you know he was running for", "02:45", "a long time before that mm-hmm but yet a", "02:47", "coach sort of shortened his his time and", "02:51", "finishing a 26 mile race at 70 years old", "02:55", "yeah it's never too late yeah", "02:57", "the bent knee is really important", "02:59", "because a lot of folks who don't pay", "03:01", "attention to the history of Footwear", "03:03", "don't understand that this fat cushioned", "03:06", "heel that everybody sort of thinks of", "03:09", "when you think of a running shoe and you", "03:10", "when you watch a lot of people run that", "03:12", "don't know any better", "03:13", "they run and they land on their heel", "03:16", "which is sort of something that was", "03:17", "created was it by Nike is that what it", "03:19", "was it created that fat bottomed heel", "03:21", "thing yeah they I think they were the", "03:23", "first one to do the offset where it was", "03:25", "traditionally I think was like 12", "03:26", "millimeters where your heel would be", "03:28", "that much higher than your forefoot but", "03:30", "I think even with when we get into kind", "03:32", "of like say heel striking versus", "03:33", "forefoot or mid-foot striking heel", "03:36", "striking is another thing where it's not", "03:37", "inherently bad it all comes down to what", "03:39", "I was saying before where if you can", "03:41", "heel strike but your foot is still", "03:43", "underneath that bent knee you're", "03:44", "probably not gonna do anything too", "03:46", "detrimental so like that it's not", "03:48", "optimal right it probably depends on the", "03:50", "specific runner and there really a", "03:52", "particular gate yeah there's a good have", "03:54", "like extra long legs or something and", "03:56", "maybe heels trick would work or extra", "03:57", "short legs or what would it be", "03:59", "yeah I don't know for sure if there's", "04:01", "like a height thing that would do I", "04:03", "think would maybe just come with like", "04:04", "the mechanics of the way the person", "04:05", "learned to run in the first place and", "04:07", "just maybe some nuances with the way", "04:09", "their body is is kind of more or less", "04:11", "designed but I mean there's there's heel", "04:14", "striking folks that are very or not", "04:16", "injury prone or have never gotten", "04:17", "injuries or hardly ever get injuries but", "04:19", "usually I think if you're doing that", "04:21", "that's probably because you're under", "04:22", "that bent knee and you're not", "04:24", "kind of having that point where your", "04:25", "foot is out in front of your knee and", "04:27", "then you kind of that straight leg but", "04:28", "at an angle where it's gonna be you know", "04:31", "not not ideal for kind of absorbing", "04:33", "those impacts yeah that's the the real", "04:35", "bad one right is when people are pigeon", "04:37", "toed when their knees kind of Bend in", "04:39", "which I do see quite a bit mm-hmm that's", "04:41", "that's got to be terrible for your knees", "04:43", "right yeah I mean I couldn't say for", "04:46", "sure but I think I think there's a lot", "04:49", "of nuance and it's ends it'd be kind of", "04:51", "like an individual situation with a lot", "04:53", "of these cases so it's hard to know for", "04:56", "sure there's probably people who can", "04:58", "talk to mechanics better than me and", "05:01", "Haley right you just run what does the", "05:03", "was that explain the record you broke", "05:05", "you ran 24 oh in less well it was a", "05:08", "hundred miles and it's a 24-hour time", "05:11", "pair but you did it in 11 hours and 41", "05:13", "minutes yeah so um it was yeah let me", "05:17", "explain a little bit so it was a the", "05:19", "event itself was called six days in the", "05:21", "dome and really what it was was you", "05:23", "could do anything from a 24-hour event", "05:25", "to a 48-hour event to a six-day event", "05:27", "and just see how far you can run within", "05:28", "that timeframe days yeah I know there's", "05:30", "some crazy people out there so just wait", "05:33", "till David Goggins finds that event but", "05:37", "yeah so I've been it's interesting", "05:39", "because there's not a lot of time events", "05:42", "that are necessarily structured 400-mile", "05:44", "or for like 12 hours so a lot of times", "05:47", "you find yourself jumping into some of", "05:49", "these other events that are longer in", "05:50", "duration and just kind of using them as", "05:52", "a way to try to run a fast hundred mile", "05:54", "er or a fast 12 hour so the race", "05:57", "director for for that particular event", "05:59", "had reached out to me because he he's", "06:01", "known me for a while and knew that I was", "06:03", "targeting fast hundred mile times and", "06:04", "just said hey I've got this cool event", "06:06", "set up at the Olympic training facility", "06:07", "in Milwaukee Wisconsin at the Pettit", "06:10", "Center and I think it's gonna be pretty", "06:11", "conducive for fast for fast times and", "06:15", "and asked I wanted to do it so I", "06:18", "actually didn't have an ideal timeline", "06:21", "to that I would have normally wanted to", "06:24", "work with in terms of getting ready for", "06:25", "it but the training went really well and", "06:28", "I went there targeting the hundred mile", "06:30", "world record which was 11 hours 28", "06:32", "minutes and 30 seconds prior to that and", "06:34", "ended up running 11 hours 19 minutes and", "06:36", "13 seconds for", "06:37", "hundred miles and then since we have", "06:39", "like this 100 mile distance and also", "06:41", "this 12-hour time to event kind of", "06:43", "structure you can find yourself if", "06:45", "you're under 12 hours kind of double", "06:47", "dipping and getting to events for the", "06:48", "price of one I guess you could say so I", "06:50", "kept running after I hit 100 miles and", "06:52", "ended up going 104 point eight eight", "06:54", "miles total in the 12 hour time frame so", "06:56", "that was another record yeah those two", "06:59", "World Records hundred miles in 12 hours", "07:01", "dude six minutes and 48 seconds for a", "07:05", "pace for a hundred miles is fucking", "07:08", "bonkers that is so fast that's so crazy", "07:12", "that's such a fast pace man yeah you", "07:16", "know it's funny like when you look at it", "07:18", "because I think sometimes people look at", "07:20", "like a hundred miles in 11 hours and 19", "07:23", "minutes and there's not a lot of context", "07:25", "and they're mindless they're kind of", "07:25", "familiar with ultra marathon running", "07:27", "mm-hmm but when you start to break it", "07:28", "down into like the subcategories where", "07:31", "it's like well that's like for like sub", "07:33", "three-hour marathons in a row or I can't", "07:36", "remember how many or what the 5k time is", "07:38", "there's like it's like 31 five K's at", "07:40", "some some times for sub three-hour", "07:43", "marathons in a row yeah Wow so crazy", "07:46", "that's so fast and are you still eating", "07:50", "mostly meat uh so you know this gets", "07:53", "brought up quite a bit I think because I", "07:55", "mean I eat a ton of animal products for", "07:56", "sure but you know I wouldn't classify", "07:59", "myself as a quote unquote carnivore or", "08:02", "quite as the carnivore diet people want", "08:04", "to claim you we discussed this kind of", "08:07", "the last time you were here where you", "08:08", "take in a lot of glucose and you you", "08:10", "wrap up your carbohydrates considerably", "08:12", "before a race like what is what is your", "08:15", "what is a daily diet let's say in", "08:17", "training you're preparing for something", "08:19", "like this what's a daily diet for you", "08:20", "like yeah yeah so yeah let's jump into", "08:23", "that I think there is some nuance within", "08:24", "that even because when you think of my", "08:26", "lifestyle the way I like describe it is", "08:28", "if you took a calendar year and you", "08:29", "grabbed a single day out of there and", "08:31", "you grabbed a day where I was yet like a", "08:33", "peak training day versus a recovery day", "08:35", "those are like so drastically different", "08:36", "in terms of my energy and my my energy", "08:39", "demands so like things tend to fluctuate", "08:42", "quite a bit and change quite a bit and I", "08:45", "think that's oftentimes what confuses", "08:46", "people because they want to they look at", "08:48", "what I'm doing say on race day they look", "08:50", "at what I'm doing on one", "08:51", "big workout days or my rest day and", "08:53", "think that's what I'm doing across the", "08:54", "board so you and you get the folks", "08:56", "saying Oh Bozek follows a carnivore diet", "08:58", "they're probably looking at like a", "08:59", "post-race recovery day where then I", "09:00", "might be eating almost all just animal", "09:02", "products a lot of eggs a lot of salmon", "09:04", "you know red meats that sort of stuff", "09:07", "but if you pick a day out where I'm", "09:10", "doing like a big training day doing like", "09:11", "a 30-mile run or something like that", "09:13", "that's where I'm gonna kind of bring", "09:15", "back some of the carbohydrates to try to", "09:16", "supplement that activity and the best", "09:19", "way to maybe describe it is uh you know", "09:21", "there's like this this that kind of", "09:22", "Train low race high or this carb", "09:25", "periodization concept that's getting", "09:27", "more momentum behind it in and more", "09:29", "studies and science behind it too", "09:30", "there's some interesting folks that are", "09:33", "looking into this in more detail and if", "09:35", "folks are really interested in doing a", "09:36", "deep dive in it there's a guy named dr.", "09:38", "mark Bub's", "09:39", "he wrote a book called peak and he kind", "09:42", "of dives into kind of like some of the", "09:43", "nutrition science where it's been and", "09:45", "kind of where it's it's kind of heading", "09:48", "and and they highlight some of that and", "09:50", "one of the big things they're starting", "09:52", "to recognize that even with the elite", "09:53", "athletes when your period izing your", "09:56", "training like I do you know your", "09:58", "nutrition should be being periodized as", "10:00", "well you know the science is pretty", "10:02", "clear that like if you're doing a", "10:04", "workout and you take in glucose or", "10:07", "fructose I think most science says a two", "10:09", "to one ratio is ideal for maximizing the", "10:11", "moment you can take in then M you're", "10:13", "going to give yourself an advantage", "10:15", "that's like rocket fuel so then it", "10:17", "becomes a question of like do you need", "10:19", "that a hundred percent of the time or do", "10:21", "you even want to do it a hundred percent", "10:22", "of time because when we look at it", "10:24", "pause you ready yeah when you say", "10:25", "glucose two-to-one like what do you mean", "10:27", "by that and wood in the coast of", "10:29", "fructose okay because what they found", "10:31", "out is when they started doing a lot of", "10:32", "like the exercise science and nutrition", "10:34", "was that the real limiter is your gut so", "10:38", "like on paper so absorption yeah uh-huh", "10:42", "yeah there's a finite amount you can", "10:43", "absorb and you increase the amount you", "10:45", "can you can absorb on average if you", "10:48", "have that two to one ratio versus all of", "10:50", "one or the other so to glucose to one", "10:52", "sucrose yeah mm-hmm interesting and now", "10:55", "what are the different sources for", "10:57", "glucose versus sucrose like sucrose is", "10:59", "simple sugar that you get is that more", "11:01", "like a refined sugar yeah yeah", "11:04", "you I think like the way like a most", "11:07", "most like sports supplements and things", "11:09", "like that are gonna be designed to kind", "11:11", "of meet those those specific because", "11:13", "they're looking at the literature and", "11:14", "they're seeing like okay this is how you", "11:15", "got selected power8 or a Gatorade or", "11:17", "something like that would be a", "11:18", "two-to-one yeah I'd have to look to see", "11:20", "exactly if they have that but my guess", "11:22", "would be they would be if they're", "11:23", "looking at the research and where that's", "11:25", "kind of that but yeah so like really", "11:29", "wanna the question that I think needs to", "11:31", "be asked with a lot of this stuff is", "11:32", "like if I want to make a workout feel as", "11:36", "easy as possible if I'm trying if I can", "11:38", "get in like say 60 grams of carbohydrate", "11:40", "per hour it's probably gonna do that", "11:42", "like my pace my perceived effort at that", "11:44", "pace is probably going to feel easier", "11:46", "but then you have to ask the question", "11:49", "like how often do you need it to feel", "11:50", "that easy so for me the answer to that", "11:53", "is like well if I'm doing something", "11:54", "really strenuous or something that's in", "11:56", "a little bit of a gray area where it's", "11:57", "just fast enough to dip into the", "11:59", "glycogen stores but just slow enough", "12:02", "that I can do it for quite a while and", "12:03", "make maybe even a couple hours then", "12:05", "you're kind of in this area where that", "12:08", "could be an advantage for you from", "12:10", "performance standpoint but if I'm going", "12:11", "out for an easy run of like 60 to 90", "12:14", "minutes and it's gonna be like a 2 to 3", "12:17", "out of 10 perceived effort anyway like", "12:20", "there's no real need for me to be", "12:22", "hitting glucose during that or you know", "12:24", "sports drink during that to make that", "12:26", "feel even easier yet because my goal", "12:28", "isn't necessarily to you know make an", "12:31", "easy run fill even easier I guess is the", "12:32", "way to layer so you call a 90 minute run", "12:34", "easy nothing just a stroll just a few", "12:37", "dozen miles well and I think that that", "12:39", "also brings up a really good point to", "12:40", "where like a lot of this stuff when", "12:42", "we're looking at carbohydrate usage and", "12:44", "performance is we're looking at elite", "12:46", "athletes we're looking at folks that are", "12:48", "training for like you know the Olympics", "12:50", "you know sometimes they're even Olympic", "12:52", "medalists and that's just not a very", "12:54", "good comparison I think to the average", "12:56", "person who's out there running because", "12:58", "you know they're doing their purposes", "12:59", "are different you know their objectives", "13:01", "are different their lifes are very", "13:02", "different like one is doing basically", "13:05", "everything around a specific specific", "13:07", "date and distance and trying to run as", "13:08", "fast as they can on that date another", "13:10", "person may be trying to run as fast as", "13:12", "they can but there's so many other", "13:13", "factors in life like their work their", "13:16", "relationships their you know", "13:18", "the level of training they're actually", "13:20", "able to have with the time they have and", "13:21", "then also like you know managing their", "13:23", "own health and nutrition because like", "13:25", "you know elite athletes don't have a", "13:27", "very rosy picture in terms of long-term", "13:28", "health either so for someone who's like", "13:31", "you know maybe 10 20 pounds overweight", "13:34", "and is trying to run to get into shape", "13:36", "or train to get into shape or something", "13:37", "like that they're probably thinking just", "13:39", "so much about health as they are about", "13:40", "performance so for them to be you know", "13:42", "shuttling in 60 grams of carbohydrate", "13:44", "every hour during training and racing is", "13:46", "it's probably not the direction that", "13:48", "they'd want to go now when you get ready", "13:49", "to do something like this 100 mile run", "13:52", "how many miles do you run on a typical", "13:54", "day and do you ramp that up or do you", "13:57", "just give yourself a base and know that", "13:59", "you can push through like how do you", "14:01", "handle that yeah so I'll build up my", "14:03", "training the way I kind of describe it", "14:05", "is like I'm always focusing on", "14:07", "specificity kind of being Kings so", "14:09", "depending on the race distance and the", "14:12", "intensity is kind of how I'm going to", "14:13", "structure my workouts so the rule of", "14:15", "thumb that I use is the closer I get to", "14:17", "the workout the more specific the", "14:19", "workouts I do are going to be towards", "14:21", "that race distance and intensity so for", "14:24", "me what that oftentimes means since I'm", "14:25", "training for like a hundred mile", "14:26", "distance races is early in a training", "14:28", "black I might be doing some like shorter", "14:30", "interval work like vo2 max like an", "14:32", "example that would maybe be like a", "14:33", "three-minute kind of almost all out", "14:35", "effort followed by like a three minute", "14:37", "recovery jog and then another", "14:38", "three-minute interval like that some of", "14:40", "those real short interval sessions and", "14:41", "how many those would you do in a row how", "14:43", "many Sprint's versus recovery", "14:45", "yeah it'll depend I'll start like pretty", "14:48", "easy I'm the first one I did the four", "14:49", "when I first started I might just do", "14:50", "three by three on that and what my goal", "14:52", "really is to every week is to kind of", "14:54", "build volume within that so that first", "14:56", "week it might be just three of them but", "14:58", "by like say the eighth week I might do a", "15:00", "total of like 24 to 27 minutes worth of", "15:03", "volume within that vo2 max context so", "15:05", "it's it's it really interesting because", "15:07", "like you know I could go out on any one", "15:09", "day and do like maybe ten of those but", "15:12", "if I do that and then it takes me like a", "15:13", "week and a half to recover from that", "15:15", "session it's not nearly as probably", "15:17", "effective as if I spread that out a", "15:18", "little bit and said did like five by", "15:20", "three and then five by three three days", "15:22", "after that give your body chance to", "15:23", "recover and build versus just destroying", "15:26", "it all in one and then feeling like shit", "15:28", "for a couple weeks exactly I like to I", "15:30", "like to call it micro stressing when I'm", "15:31", "working with", "15:32", "folks and my own training I'm like we", "15:34", "want a micro stress if you want to", "15:35", "stress you just enough to elicit a", "15:37", "response and as you get stronger and", "15:39", "then we want to do that over and over", "15:40", "and over again are you where you I'm", "15:42", "sure you are you know who Pavel Tatsu", "15:44", "lanius yeah yeah so he's got that sort", "15:46", "of concept when it comes to", "15:47", "weightlifting with kettlebells in", "15:49", "particular calling greasing the groove", "15:50", "yeah whereas instead of doing all these", "15:53", "sets to failure you would just do like", "15:57", "half of what you're capable of and then", "16:00", "do it again in a more frequent pace like", "16:03", "do it again rather you know do it again", "16:05", "on Wednesday do it again on Friday and", "16:07", "then give yourself a lot of time in", "16:09", "between each individual activity to", "16:11", "particularly in training for strength he", "16:13", "actually recommends as much as ten", "16:16", "minutes of recovery in between sets", "16:18", "which is you know kind of correct me and", "16:19", "most people not all the time for that", "16:21", "you know six sets is an hour in I mean", "16:24", "it seems like you're just laying around", "16:25", "the gym people would if you were a gym", "16:27", "people in mock you but that's his", "16:29", "protocol mmhmm yeah yeah and I think", "16:31", "it's I think it you know endurance is", "16:33", "like a it's a patient person's game so I", "16:34", "think if you can build that volume in a", "16:37", "you know micro stressing or in a like a", "16:39", "sustainable way that's what's gonna keep", "16:40", "you or get you strong and it's also", "16:43", "gonna make it less likely to get injured", "16:45", "how much time do you need like like if", "16:48", "you got you know up to that insane pace", "16:52", "that you did when you ran 100 miles when", "16:55", "if you took like a week off or two weeks", "16:57", "off how much would you lose not much in", "17:00", "that amount of time especially at that", "17:02", "intensity so the thing is is like the", "17:04", "648 mile pace you we need to be kind of", "17:07", "relative about it so like for me when", "17:09", "I'm out training when I'm not when I'm", "17:11", "not what I'm fully recovered that's like", "17:14", "a pretty reasonable pace from an", "17:16", "intensity standpoint so the interesting", "17:18", "thing about ultra marathon is race pace", "17:21", "is sometimes faster than even some of", "17:24", "your easiest runs and training so your", "17:26", "training is kind of all what we would", "17:28", "call like over speed training hmm", "17:30", "whereas in most endurance events from", "17:31", "like the 1500 up to like the marathon", "17:33", "the majority of your work is gonna be", "17:35", "sub-race pace and then you're gonna have", "17:38", "like depending on the program you know", "17:40", "maybe 20-30 percent of that be like over", "17:42", "speed training why is that well just", "17:45", "because the", "17:46", "duration of the event is so long like", "17:48", "you know I can't run fast if I run too", "17:51", "fast then it's just gonna end badly for", "17:53", "me right but why is that with marathons", "17:55", "oh well because it's it becomes it's", "17:58", "similar to strength training where like", "17:59", "if the limiter is like the amount of", "18:01", "like stress you put on your body so if I", "18:04", "was gonna train to peak and say a", "18:06", "marathon my my max potential pace for", "18:09", "that wouldn't be sustainable to do every", "18:11", "run so I'd be running I'd be running too", "18:13", "hard too fast too often and then we'd", "18:15", "get into that that kind of a situation", "18:17", "that we're talking about before where", "18:18", "you're starting to macro stress versus", "18:20", "micro stress so if you run a marathon", "18:22", "what is your standard marathon pace so I", "18:25", "I'm a little goofy where I competed in", "18:28", "high school in college and then I did", "18:30", "some marathons but not really in a", "18:31", "structured manner and then I got an", "18:33", "ultra marathon running so I haven't", "18:35", "really done what I would consider a real", "18:36", "legitimate marathon training program so", "18:38", "you're basically saying marathons are", "18:40", "for pussies right you're saying just say", "18:41", "I actually think the marathon", "18:44", "I just think marathons are maybe the", "18:47", "hardest event of them all I'll explain", "18:49", "why because you're going fast well yeah", "18:52", "it's just short enough where you have to", "18:53", "be pushing like a fairly intense pace", "18:55", "but it's just long enough where if you", "18:57", "make a mistake you're gonna pay for that", "18:58", "for quite some time so you're on such a", "19:00", "razor's edge and you're also just one", "19:02", "tiny mistake away from things going", "19:04", "really bad and what you're saying about", "19:05", "mistake you're talking about pacing okay", "19:07", "yeah if you go out too hard yeah I see", "19:09", "your watch what is it what kind of watch", "19:11", "you wearing it's a Kouros apex what I've", "19:14", "never heard of that one before had a GPS", "19:16", "watch one of those yeah it's it's", "19:19", "relative they're a relatively new brand", "19:20", "like in in running I guess like the two", "19:23", "kind of big players historically have", "19:25", "been Suunto and Garmin mm-hmm and", "19:27", "korells kind of came to the market a few", "19:29", "years ago they wanted to try to make", "19:31", "like take that high-end technology but", "19:33", "make it maybe a little more affordable", "19:35", "and also make it user friendly because", "19:37", "now everyone's there they care more", "19:39", "about the post-workout or the post run", "19:42", "data that you're uploading to these", "19:43", "platforms like Strava so like corals", "19:46", "kind of made it a big point to make it", "19:49", "really user friendly on that end so you", "19:50", "like I get done with the run and I load", "19:52", "it up to the app and it's up on Strava", "19:54", "like within a few seconds sometimes and", "19:55", "then you go dissect all the data like", "19:58", "how much elevation", "19:59", "gain and loss your pace per mile oh is", "20:02", "this primarily a running watch I mean", "20:05", "you could use it for running or cycling", "20:07", "or hiking or mountaineering or anything", "20:09", "like that it's got like all those kind", "20:11", "of bells and whistles on okay so so if", "20:14", "your my question was like it so if", "20:16", "you're running how long you are you're", "20:17", "checking your watch if you're doing a", "20:19", "marathon you're making sure that you're", "20:20", "not going crazy because it's is it", "20:22", "otherwise you just have to kind of gauge", "20:23", "it just based on the pack and based on", "20:26", "how you feel yeah and I think that's", "20:28", "actually a good especially when you get", "20:30", "into ultra marathon I think the metric", "20:32", "that people should dial in the most is", "20:34", "their rate of perceived exertion because", "20:36", "that's something that's not gonna", "20:37", "necessarily lie to you like if you base", "20:40", "your thing your stuff off heart rate", "20:41", "exclusively or a pace exclusively you", "20:43", "can find yourself like justifying", "20:45", "something that's not necessarily where", "20:46", "you need to be and if something like", "20:48", "that malfunctions and that was your like", "20:50", "only compass then you're in trouble so I", "20:52", "like when I'm doing my training and when", "20:54", "I'm working with other folks I like to", "20:56", "use heart rate and I like to use pacing", "20:58", "and stuff like that but ultimately I'm", "20:59", "trying to get the person to really", "21:00", "understand like how hard is this effort", "21:03", "and then across the board from like very", "21:06", "easy to very difficult and then when it", "21:09", "comes time to race we can kind of dial", "21:11", "in like this is the intensity you're", "21:12", "trying to look for so that they can kind", "21:13", "of feel that out to use a metric like to", "21:15", "you say like how do you feel seven to", "21:17", "ten yeah pretty much", "21:18", "I'll have a scale of like one to ten", "21:20", "that I'll use a lot of times and there's", "21:22", "like a whole variety like most people", "21:24", "are gonna be using some sort of like", "21:25", "probably like zone system of training", "21:27", "where there's like there's numbers that", "21:29", "are associated with heart rate ranges or", "21:31", "intensities and there will be", "21:32", "descriptors and you know there's some", "21:34", "that are like 1 through 20 there's some", "21:36", "that are kind of 1 through 5 and then 1", "21:38", "through 10 and isn't that so so weird", "21:40", "too right because it's so it's", "21:41", "subjective I mean the whoop-whoop strap", "21:44", "is something I wear and it uses", "21:45", "something like that like what's your", "21:47", "perceived exertion of my own I just push", "21:50", "it towards the far right I don't know", "21:52", "like what does that mean like it's it's", "21:54", "also hard to gauge your perceived", "21:57", "exertion especially when the workouts", "21:58", "over yeah I was hard I went on went all", "22:01", "out like what does that mean I don't", "22:02", "know what that means", "22:03", "you know yeah yeah it can be tricky and", "22:05", "it is very subjective but I think it's", "22:07", "one of those things where it falls into", "22:09", "the same category that a lot of", "22:11", "endurance events are where you just got", "22:12", "to be patient and", "22:13", "really work on kind of understanding", "22:14", "that and you learn from experience to", "22:16", "like you you find out like oh I went and", "22:19", "did this workout and I thought that was", "22:20", "the right pace and intensity that turned", "22:22", "out to be a little too fast duty keep a", "22:24", "training log yeah mm-hm and do you like", "22:27", "write it on Excel or something like that", "22:28", "yeah I basically just load all my stuff", "22:30", "up to Strava and then yeah so that's", "22:33", "kind of like the go-to for most runners", "22:34", "these days is I'm sorry but do you keep", "22:37", "like a diary like today felt like this", "22:39", "and this was an issue and I felt like I", "22:42", "didn't have enough fluids or do you do", "22:44", "anything like that not so much anymore I", "22:46", "did it a lot when I was in college and I", "22:48", "did it a lot when I first started when I", "22:49", "was really trying to kind of learn my", "22:51", "body and kind of learn what things mean", "22:53", "and and how I respond to them but now", "22:55", "I've been kind of doing it long enough", "22:57", "where I have enough of a like an", "23:00", "understanding of kind of how like when", "23:02", "things go wrong like why they did or if", "23:05", "something went really well like why it", "23:07", "did that", "23:07", "I don't feel like I need to take as", "23:09", "detailed notes but I think it's really", "23:11", "valuable for someone who's especially", "23:13", "well they're trying to learn the rate of", "23:14", "perceived exertion and kind of really", "23:15", "dial those things in it's probably worth", "23:18", "a lot of worth a lot worth their time to", "23:20", "write that stuff down so that they can", "23:21", "look back at it and they have that", "23:22", "resource available to them as they're", "23:24", "kind of reflecting on things now say if", "23:26", "you're getting ready to do something", "23:27", "like this crazy 100 mile run trying to", "23:30", "break a world record what what do you", "23:32", "would help much time you giving yourself", "23:35", "to really truly prepare for that is it", "23:37", "based on what how you're at right now", "23:39", "like what your baseline is like what", "23:41", "kind of preparation you've done before", "23:42", "you knew that this race was available to", "23:44", "you like how do you do that mm-hmm yeah", "23:46", "no and this is this little we can kind", "23:48", "of hop back to where we're talking about", "23:49", "before because when I was talking about", "23:50", "the vo2 max work know stuff that's kind", "23:52", "of early in my training plan because", "23:54", "that intensity is very unspecific to a", "23:56", "hundred mile you pace you know that's", "23:59", "you know those vo2 max workouts are much", "24:01", "closer to something shorter like a 5k so", "24:03", "what are you trying to do with those of", "24:04", "you - max workouts you just trying to", "24:07", "elevate your your base yeah like just in", "24:11", "like a hear that like there's the", "24:12", "different systems of training and that's", "24:13", "kind of a higher intensity system so", "24:16", "it's not very relevant to the race pace", "24:18", "that I'm doing specifically but it's not", "24:20", "irrelevant to my overall like aerobic", "24:23", "efficiency so like by doing some of", "24:25", "those faster stuff things you", "24:27", "work on things like your form and just", "24:29", "because when you're running that fast", "24:30", "like things tend to be a little more", "24:32", "dialed in and it just it expands it", "24:35", "basically what you do is you give", "24:36", "yourself kind of a bigger range of what", "24:38", "your potential is gonna be when you", "24:40", "start focusing more and on like the", "24:42", "aerobic side of things that we're gonna", "24:44", "see like as I would move further down in", "24:46", "the training plan so once I kind of do", "24:49", "that section of training to answer your", "24:52", "question they're like ideally I'll have", "24:54", "maybe about since I'm coming into most", "24:56", "programs not completely out of shape", "24:58", "like four months is kind of a sweet spot", "25:00", "for me if I was coming like off the", "25:02", "couch so to speak six months would be a", "25:04", "little more appropriate are you ever off", "25:05", "the couch only if I'm injured and I've", "25:08", "only been injured in any significant way", "25:09", "since ultra since they're altering", "25:11", "running once for about five weeks seven", "25:13", "I had a stress fracture on my right", "25:15", "sacral ax", "25:16", "it's kind it's basically like on your", "25:18", "tailbone oh ouch yeah yeah the fuck", "25:21", "happened so what I think I don't know", "25:23", "it's hard to know for sure but what was", "25:25", "the way was described to me when I was", "25:27", "going in and getting eye stuff checked", "25:28", "out was what likely happened was I had", "25:30", "such a history and kind of flat running", "25:32", "that I was actually preparing for a race", "25:34", "had a lot more climbing descending so I", "25:35", "started changing my training to more", "25:37", "climbing and ascending and when I did", "25:39", "that like one thing that sometimes", "25:42", "happens when you're running a lot of", "25:43", "flat hard surfaces is you're like ankles", "25:45", "and your hips can get pretty tight from", "25:47", "that real like kind of uniform like", "25:50", "mechanic's that you're doing so like my", "25:52", "range of motion was semi limited so when", "25:54", "I was doing some of that hard downhill", "25:56", "and uphill running I just probably", "25:58", "wasn't very efficient with my form and", "26:00", "it ended up the kind of were talking", "26:01", "before those impact forces ended up in", "26:03", "the wrong spot and then the stress", "26:05", "fracture occurred that is crazy you", "26:06", "broke your ass you literally broke your", "26:09", "ass yeah people always talk about all he", "26:10", "was busting his ass like you actually", "26:12", "did so where is it Jamie right there oh", "26:15", "Jesus Christ it's so it's it literally", "26:18", "is your ass bone you a really goofy", "26:20", "thing about it too was Wow when I first", "26:22", "had the pain surface for that it was", "26:24", "kind of in like the like lower back", "26:27", "glute area is where it surfaced so I", "26:29", "thought I had like a sciatic issue like", "26:32", "I went into the doctor and they were", "26:34", "like okay let's try some like actives", "26:36", "release therapy and let's see if we can", "26:37", "get this thing to loosen up and we just", "26:39", "were working on", "26:40", "working on it and like it would like", "26:41", "clear up where I wouldn't notice it if I", "26:43", "was walking around but then every time", "26:45", "I'd go for a run or try to go for a run", "26:46", "I get that sharp pain right away and so", "26:49", "after about I think it was maybe four", "26:51", "weeks or so we just we had been doing a", "26:53", "ton of Active Release a ton of mobility", "26:55", "work and then like it wasn't going away", "26:58", "so he's like well let's just get an MRI", "26:59", "and see what's going on in there and", "27:00", "they did the MRI got the results back", "27:02", "and he said there's nothing there so you", "27:05", "start running again so I started running", "27:06", "again I ran like I think it was two or", "27:09", "three days maybe very short like two", "27:11", "miles and then three miles then maybe", "27:12", "five or something like that and then I", "27:14", "got a call back from the doctor and he's", "27:16", "like well it turns out we took a second", "27:18", "look at the MRI there is a stress", "27:19", "fracture I told him like well I just ran", "27:22", "the first three pain-free days I ever I", "27:24", "have since this this issue nine fuck", "27:27", "yeah well and I think what he said maybe", "27:29", "was going on there was it was I mean it", "27:31", "was a very fine stress fracture it", "27:33", "wasn't", "27:34", "I mean sometimes when people have a", "27:35", "fracture on their sacred Ala it's like a", "27:37", "big enough fracture where like it can be", "27:39", "out for like a year and oh yeah yeah so", "27:42", "it can be a really bad injury but he", "27:44", "said maybe the mobility and the strength", "27:46", "work I was doing while I had that to try", "27:48", "to rehab kind of strengthen the areas", "27:51", "around it enough that when I just was", "27:52", "running flat really slow really easy", "27:54", "that protected that area enough where I", "27:56", "didn't feel the pain anymore so after", "27:58", "that I think I took another like two", "28:00", "weeks off completely just to make sure", "28:02", "before I started building back up and", "28:04", "then I started kind of building back up", "28:05", "again do you ever run on one of those", "28:06", "err runner things you know those", "28:08", "self-propelling treadmills I've been on", "28:11", "one once before but not in any like a", "28:13", "significant way they look pretty sweet I", "28:14", "love those damn things which one do we", "28:16", "have what is it uh who makes it it's", "28:20", "aired I'm right airdyne makes it the air", "28:23", "runner is that what it's called", "28:24", "Jamie I'll find out but anyway man it's", "28:27", "some percentage thirteen or make up the", "28:30", "number 13 percent harder than actual air", "28:32", "assault", "28:33", "air runner yeah it's amazing it's hard", "28:37", "as fuck I gave one to Bert Bert", "28:39", "Kreischer losers too hard because he", "28:41", "likes using a treadmill and pretending", "28:43", "he's really running when he's just", "28:44", "picking his legs up and down you know", "28:46", "but that makes you actually push and see", "28:49", "your calves get blown the fuck up man", "28:51", "it's", "28:52", "it's hard yes it's really good and it's", "28:55", "what does it say and what is its what", "28:57", "percentage does it say it's harder than", "28:59", "actual running like if you were just", "29:01", "running at the same pace some people are", "29:04", "like runnings hard enough why are we", "29:06", "making it harder but the idea is that", "29:07", "you go and run and mix running easier", "29:09", "uh-huh yeah sort of like running with", "29:10", "weights on uh-huh but it doesn't give", "29:13", "you an additional stress yes not too", "29:15", "good it's not pounding on your body", "29:16", "mm-hmm you know it's not like you're", "29:18", "you're doing anything that's gonna", "29:19", "injure you but it's it's caught you you", "29:22", "know you have to propel that thing you", "29:24", "know it's if folks don't know what we're", "29:26", "talking about it's basically a very", "29:27", "subtle you right like the way the thing", "29:31", "is structured and it's got tread on it", "29:33", "and as you run you are the thing that's", "29:36", "making it move so there's no machine or", "29:38", "it's not plugged in it's not like it's", "29:41", "electronic and you set the pace and you", "29:44", "just gotta keep up with it it's not it's", "29:46", "you're making it run uh-huh so you're", "29:48", "pushing it and as you push it it", "29:51", "requires extra energy and extra effort", "29:53", "in that extra effort when you actually", "29:55", "go run on a regular road surface or a", "29:58", "trail it seems easier mm-hmm yeah I know", "30:00", "that makes sense and I think it's pretty", "30:02", "cool because like yeah with the weighted", "30:03", "stuff like you run the risk essentially", "30:05", "hurt something bad additional weight", "30:07", "like they were doing these rock", "30:09", "challenges I forget to come I think it", "30:13", "was trained to hunt or one at one of", "30:16", "these one of these competitions they", "30:18", "were making people wear heavy packs it", "30:21", "might not have been trained to hunt it", "30:21", "was much I think it was another cunt but", "30:23", "anyway they would make you wear like a", "30:24", "hundred pound pack and so the idea was", "30:27", "they were doing these races with a", "30:29", "hundred pound packs on which you can", "30:32", "imagine is a fucking recipe for", "30:34", "orthopedic surgeon races yeah and so", "30:37", "these people were getting kind of jacked", "30:38", "up and they Steve they stopped doing", "30:41", "that as a competent you know as a", "30:43", "running competition but there's a few of", "30:45", "those similar kind of competitions where", "30:47", "they force you to do a bunch of physical", "30:49", "activities and then bring your heart", "30:51", "rate down and execute shots on targets", "30:53", "and then run to the next station and do", "30:55", "a bunch of physical activities and they", "30:57", "were doing that with heavy heavy weights", "30:58", "on and just really was a bad idea", "31:00", "mm-hmm yeah yeah I think that would that", "31:03", "would be maybe good for if you're gonna", "31:04", "do like a mountain", "31:06", "hearing experience and you got to carry", "31:07", "a bunch of old stuff like you're doing", "31:08", "with the hunting but even then you", "31:10", "really should just ruck", "31:11", "yes pet the heavy pack on there's a", "31:14", "company called outdoorsman's it makes a", "31:16", "really good one it's called an atlas", "31:18", "pack and it's essentially a pack frame", "31:19", "but the back of it is a universal post", "31:22", "like would you would use for weights you", "31:25", "know like a weightlifting post for you", "31:28", "know Olympic weights you know so those", "31:30", "big round steel plates slide right onto", "31:33", "it so you can get a 45-pound plate on it", "31:35", "and then clamp it down and so it's like", "31:38", "really secure on you as opposed to like", "31:40", "sometimes if you put too much weight in", "31:42", "a pack like maybe it'll sit all at the", "31:43", "bottom it's this is like boom right the", "31:46", "center of your back and you cramp it", "31:48", "down and and then you know you're really", "31:50",

a", "32:26", "I'm trying to find like testing or some", "32:28", "it doesn't seem like it's 30 percent", "32:32", "mathematician but it's it's just", "32:35", "excellent for training do you do any", "32:37", "training on machines or is all your", "32:39", "training essentially done on the road", "32:41", "the running is all pretty much done on", "32:43", "the road in the trails I'll do like some", "32:45", "mobility work and some strength work on", "32:47", "the gym and that's where I'll I'll kind", "32:49", "of go inside I guess for it but yeah you", "32:52", "know I I've used treadmills and stuff in", "32:54", "the past and I do use them from time to", "32:56", "time but usually if I have the option to", "32:58", "go outside I'll do that and I mean I", "33:00", "live in Phoenix so it's you know we're", "33:03", "it's sunny Coles days 7d yeah exam there", "33:06", "this weekend actually oh yeah that's", "33:07", "right you're at the is it chimeric", "33:09", "america's next", "33:10", "yeah Friday and Saturday I'm psyched", "33:12", "yeah I love Phoenix yeah it's the time", "33:14", "of year to be there for sure yeah man", "33:16", "right what's what's the temperature", "33:17", "there right now probably maybe 65", "33:20", "I ever saw I've been there before in the", "33:22", "summer in July when he at Tempe improv", "33:25", "and it was like fucking 120 uh-huh well", "33:27", "and that's that's the funny thing too", "33:28", "cuz when I was training for that 100", "33:30", "mile 12-hour world record it was through", "33:32", "the summer because the race was in", "33:33", "August so my training was like 110", "33:36", "degrees some days and the funny thing", "33:38", "too is the Petitte Center where I did", "33:39", "the race it was actually built for speed", "33:42", "skating and some hockey rinks so they", "33:44", "keep it at like 60 degrees nevermind I", "33:46", "remember one day when I was running it", "33:48", "was like one of the hottest days this", "33:49", "summer I'm are thinking like I'm gonna", "33:51", "race literally at half this temperature", "33:53", "yeah so it's really funny when you when", "33:56", "you see when you see that and I think", "33:57", "I'm I'm no expert at it by any means but", "34:00", "I think there's some pretty cool like", "34:02", "studies and stuff that of the effects", "34:04", "that happen when you are training in", "34:06", "some of those extreme heats like what", "34:07", "happens it for the way was described to", "34:09", "me is it kind of simulates training at", "34:10", "altitude to a degree hmm", "34:12", "so who knows maybe that makes sense well", "34:15", "it's similar to hot yoga right mm-hmm", "34:17", "that's they're doing some studies at", "34:18", "Harvard I believe I think it's Harvard", "34:20", "someone was explaining the whole deal to", "34:22", "me there's not something that I read but", "34:24", "essentially what they're doing is", "34:25", "they're trying to find out whether or", "34:27", "not hot yoga these 90-minute hot yoga", "34:29", "sessions replicates some of the known", "34:31", "benefits of sauna uh-huh because you", "34:34", "know obviously the temperature is not as", "34:36", "hot they keep it the hot yoga place I go", "34:39", "to I think they keep it at 105 degrees", "34:41", "versus sauna you know it gets much much", "34:43", "hotter than that you're in like the 180s", "34:45", "which what I like and but the idea is", "34:48", "that when your body is extremely", "34:51", "stressed when you're doing these poses", "34:53", "and you're sweating like crazy that your", "34:55", "body core temperature rises basically to", "34:58", "similar level then if you're just", "35:00", "sitting in a sauna so you get a very", "35:03", "similar response yeah yeah it's it's", "35:05", "really interesting so I try to remember", "35:08", "that when it's the summer in Phoenix so", "35:10", "I don't get to miss yeah it's got you", "35:13", "got to be doing yourself good crock gym", "35:15", "which is one of the most famous boxing", "35:17", "gyms in history a Manuel Stewart who was", "35:19", "a just a wizard of boxing and he trained", "35:22", "Tommy Hearns and you know some of the", "35:24", "like to all-time greats of that era he", "35:28", "would crank the temperature and this is", "35:29", "in Detroit they would crank the", "35:31", "temperature up really hot", "35:33", "you'd go into that gym and it would be", "35:35", "that way like for that specific reason", "35:37", "because he believed that it increased", "35:39", "endurance mm-hmm yeah it's it's", "35:41", "interesting stuff but I'll still take", "35:43", "January and February for comfort now", "35:46", "what do you do in terms of like how do", "35:48", "you hydrate yourself and like what what", "35:51", "kind of durations are we talking about", "35:53", "like Savior if it's 110 degrees outside", "35:56", "120 with it was the hottest you ran out", "35:58", "I think 110 is what I do and I try to", "36:00", "get out relatively early so that it's", "36:03", "not like 110 from start to finish so", "36:05", "like if I get out say at like 6:00 or", "36:08", "7:00 in the morning you know it might be", "36:09", "in the 80s high 80s and be working its", "36:12", "way up so that like I'm finishing and it", "36:14", "might be 1:10 for Mikey workouts the way", "36:17", "I structure my training usually when I'm", "36:18", "kind of in peak is I'll do them my", "36:20", "biggest workout in the morning and then", "36:22", "I might go out and do like a second run", "36:24", "that's like a little shorter or quite a", "36:26", "bit shorter in most cases and really low", "36:28", "intensity and you know then sometimes if", "36:31", "it's the afternoon in Phoenix that's", "36:32", "when I would see like that 1:10 but I'm", "36:34", "usually not out for more than like 45 60", "36:36", "minutes for those so hydrating is is", "36:39", "interesting because you know I grew up", "36:40", "in the Midwest so I was very familiar", "36:42", "with running in hot humid stuff in the", "36:44", "summer and you know the dry desert heat", "36:47", "though it seems like you get thirsty a", "36:49", "lot quicker and a lot more frequently so", "36:51", "I you know one of the things I learned", "36:54", "the first summer I was in Phoenix was", "36:55", "knowing where the water fountains are", "36:57", "and kind of planning your house around", "36:58", "that you drink out of public water", "37:00", "fountains when I have to you worry about", "37:02", "cooties I haven't gotten anything too", "37:04", "miserable yeah in fact I did a race", "37:06", "earlier this year it was in early June", "37:09", "called the San Diego hundred and it's", "37:13", "got this spot in the middle of the", "37:14", "course where the aid stations are a", "37:16", "little further apart there's like a nine", "37:17", "mile stretch in a seven mile stretch and", "37:19", "I kind of miss timed how much water I", "37:21", "did so I filled up my water and a stream", "37:24", "and it was probably not an ideal oh dude", "37:27", "but I rolled the dice and it just I", "37:28", "don't get no I'm getting pad no I'm I", "37:30", "thought during the race was this is the", "37:32", "mindset in the middle of one of these", "37:33", "things is like well if something really", "37:35", "bad happens will happen after the race", "37:36", "so I definitely would but it's really", "37:38", "bad yeah already is rough I've never had", "37:41", "it but the people that I know that have", "37:42", "had it say it's really bad but you know", "37:44", "you could just bring a SteriPEN you", "37:46", "but you can't really stop huh yeah I", "37:49", "mean in a race I wouldn't want to yeah", "37:51", "and what what really helped for me was", "37:54", "the the situation is since the track", "37:56", "rate since the race was on an indoor", "37:58", "track 400 and like I think 42 and some", "38:00", "odd meters I was doing a lot of my big", "38:03", "long runs on a 400 meter track okay so", "38:06", "when I did that I would just bring out", "38:08", "like a cooler I don't have ice and water", "38:10", "in there I would sit there waiting for", "38:12", "you oh that's sweet yeah that makes", "38:14", "sense but when you do a lot of trail", "38:16", "running though right I do some of that", "38:17", "too yeah", "38:18", "historically I've done a lot more flat", "38:21", "runnable stuff but now that I'm out in", "38:23", "Phoenix I like to try to split the year", "38:24", "into two halves and do some trail stuff", "38:26", "in half the year and some like flat or", "38:27", "rogue or track or runnable stuff in the", "38:29", "second half do you bring water when you", "38:32", "run trails do you bring like a backpack", "38:33", "or something like that like one of those", "38:35", "um you know what Zack yeah yeah with the", "38:38", "tubes", "38:39", "yeah but the fuck is that camels camel", "38:41", "camel backs", "38:42", "yeah there's I'll do I don't usually use", "38:44", "what they call like the bladder which is", "38:46", "the tube thing that you're talking nice", "38:47", "though they are and you can pack a lot", "38:48", "of water yeah usually unless I unless", "38:51", "I'm gonna be away from a potential stop", "38:54", "long enough usually what I'll do is I'll", "38:55", "I'll use the pack but I'll have like", "38:57", "small or a little like like little", "38:59", "flasks soft lacks in there okay so you", "39:01", "bring those two that you even like on", "39:02", "the the chest straps yeah a lot of", "39:04", "people with those but you're rolling the", "39:06", "dice with that like you got to know how", "39:08", "much to sip yeah you know we're lady the", "39:11", "pickup spots are from or run with", "39:13", "friends yeah when I run with my dog in", "39:17", "the summer when it gets really hot I", "39:18", "bring a hydro flask in a backpack and", "39:21", "I'm one of those collapsible dog bowls", "39:22", "because you know I don't want him", "39:24", "drinking out of puddles and so but that", "39:27", "just having that extra couple pounds on", "39:30", "your back it makes a difference you can", "39:32", "you feel it yeah yeah and that's that's", "39:35", "why part of the reason why I try to go", "39:37", "as minimal as I can with water if I if I", "39:40", "can get away with it obviously if I go", "39:42", "out and do like a big loop where there's", "39:44", "no potential stops I'm gonna have to", "39:45", "carry it all from the beginning but if", "39:47", "it's a spot where I know like I can get", "39:49", "to water every five six seven miles then", "39:51", "usual I'll pack a little lighter and not", "39:54", "be carrying as much at any one given", "39:56", "time do you hydrate up before you go", "39:58", "yeah I mean I think that's the one's one", "40:00", "of the", "40:00", "things to really get right in Phoenix", "40:02", "was just like kind of learning kind of", "40:05", "how much you need to be hydrating like", "40:07", "between sessions because what I usually", "40:08", "found out is I could go out and kind of", "40:10", "neglect hydration for anyone given like", "40:12", "run or workout but if I did that then", "40:14", "the next one I'd probably pay for it so", "40:16", "for me the big motivation to make sure", "40:19", "I'm on top a hydration during any given", "40:20", "run is because I know like if I don't", "40:22", "then the next one's gonna potentially be", "40:25", "man I've done that before that's that's", "40:28", "a weird feeling trying to do anything", "40:29", "when you're dehydrated it's like you", "40:31", "have a bad battery or something yeah", "40:33", "it's like everything's like oh come on", "40:36", "it's it's it's amazing how just normal", "40:39", "everyday life like you could feel like a", "40:42", "little run down you barely notice it but", "40:45", "once you start physically exerting once", "40:47", "you start training once you start doing", "40:49", "something hard that's when you become", "40:50", "like really in tune with how you're", "40:53", "screwing your body up like drinking for", "40:55", "instance mm-hmm like have a couple of", "40:57", "drinks and then run like oh god you're", "41:00", "like well this is what it's doing to my", "41:02", "body yeah I got a fucking stop drinking", "41:04", "you know yeah yeah I think you you I", "41:06", "like drinking to thirst that's use you", "41:08", "but my gauge is and I haven't really had", "41:11", "any issues with it with that with that", "41:13", "so there's no like strategy like say I'm", "41:15", "gonna run 25 miles today let me drink X", "41:18", "amount of liters of water before I go", "41:20", "out", "41:20", "no before the run ya know I try not to", "41:23", "like do too much like kind of like", "41:26", "pre-emptive hydrating because I think", "41:28", "what you want what people oftentimes I", "41:30", "think do then is they drink too much and", "41:32", "then that comes out of the expense of", "41:34", "your electrolytes too because your", "41:35", "body's gonna screech those so if I'm if", "41:38", "I find myself", "41:39", "couldn't you just supplement you can", "41:41", "yeah and I'll do a lot more of that", "41:43", "especially in the heat too just in", "41:45", "general is like having like electrolyte", "41:47", "supplementation and things like what do", "41:49", "you use for your electrolytes", "41:50", "supplementation I use a product called", "41:52", "hydro ax mostly it's a like a powder", "41:55", "that you can kind of mix in with your", "41:56", "water by a company named X endurance", "41:58", "they have they make these little tubes", "42:01", "now to wear like so if I'm running and I", "42:04", "have like one bottle with some in it", "42:05", "already I can have these little like", "42:07", "just these little tubes that if I've", "42:09", "refill and want to put more and I can", "42:11", "just kind of take them all pop it off", "42:12", "and and pour that in", "42:14", "a lot of other people will use you can", "42:16", "make like little caps that you just", "42:19", "swallow it with your water and it's got", "42:20", "like the formulation of the different", "42:22", "electrolytes in there kind of dialed in", "42:23", "and you know that's a and I think that's", "42:27", "a little more hit or miss as to like", "42:30", "like where people feel you need that", "42:31", "some people tell you don't really need", "42:33", "electrolytes at all just need to salt", "42:35", "your foods and things like that all the", "42:36", "way to like you should be taking X", "42:37", "number of these every hour there's got", "42:40", "to be science behind it right I mean do", "42:41", "you are you getting blood tests and", "42:43", "finding out what your levels are pre and", "42:45", "post workouts or anything along those", "42:46", "lines yeah I haven't done any like post", "42:49", "workout tests to say other than I know I", "42:51", "was part of the faster study which was a", "42:53", "study that looked at high carb and high", "42:56", "fat athletes and I think they were", "42:57", "looking at some of that stuff too and", "42:59", "like anytime I've ever had a blood test", "43:02", "done though by like my my electrolytes", "43:03", "like my sodium potassium levels always", "43:05", "been in range so I haven't really tried", "43:07",

alike", "43:39", "I believe it's in Utah in Salt Lake okay", "43:42", "and I don't know like if the how", "43:44", "accurate or whatever this is but like", "43:47", "they I heard that if you can get an", "43:48", "inland sea salt it's better because it's", "43:50", "not like it doesn't have potential as", "43:54", "many potential toxins that you can find", "43:55", "in like oceans yeah yeah

explained that how does that", "44:18", "work was it an older sea I wonder what", "44:21", "it is and it's similar it's just like", "44:23", "these big salt oh it is just salt okay", "44:25", "oh it's just Himalayan salt No", "44:27", "oh yeah I think I've heard it like an", "44:30", "old C that's no longer there and they", "44:31", "just have the big salt deposits right", "44:33", "like that's what a lot of Montana is the", "44:36", "Great Western in inland sea you know", "44:39", "like millions of years ago like they", "44:41", "find seashells in Montana yeah she was", "44:44", "just

you do it", "47:59", "on your app and all that stuff but", "48:01", "because it's so well insulated and I", "48:03", "cook most what I cook is wild game which", "48:06", "is very low in fat mm-hmm so you really", "48:09", "can't you really shouldn't cook at high", "48:10", "heat or for any long period of time you", "48:12", "got them you got to make sure you", "48:13", "monitor the temperature of

love", "49:04", "the flavor of like the salty on the", "49:07", "outside and then especially when it's", "49:08", "seared you know it's just nice yeah yeah", "49:11", "you know I I think like that the low and", "49:14", "slow is the way to go for a lot of that", "49:15", "stuff and yeah when I do a when I roast", "49:17", "uh I'll get like a roast I'll put it in", "49:19", "a slow cooker and

nice yeah yeah a lot of people", "49:30", "have their own idea about what to do and", "49:32", "what not to do but I I learned this from", "49:34", "a guy named Chad Ward his uh label on", "49:38",

it's", "50:07", "better to bring it up to temperature", "50:09", "slowly inside like a pellet grill", "50:12", "another good method is Susie do you ever", "50:13", "sous-vide things I I haven't yet I've", "50:16", "had it from restaurants before though", "50:17", "yeah I was talking to someone they said", "50:19", "a lot of restaurants now do that just so", "50:20", "they can kind of make their all their", "50:22", "stuff more uniform so ya go and you get", "50:24", "exactly what you did the last time yeah", "50:26", "they don't no one fucks up because if", "50:28", "you go you know you can go to restaurant", "50:29", "order medium-rare and it comes out well", "50:30", "right yeah", "50:31", "I've had that happen right but the", "50:34", "sous-vide method is fantastic too", "50:36", "because say if you have a steak and you", "50:38", "want that steak to be a hundred and", "50:40", "thirty-five degrees you basically put", "50:42", "the the the setting at 135 degrees you", "50:46",

a hot car mm-hmm", "51:10", "it's like how the fuck can you", "51:11", "apparently you can that's not an issue", "51:14", "at all you know to cook in it", "51:16", "you know but it makes me feel weird if", "51:18", "eventually we'll here in five years that", "51:20", "that's going to give us cancers I don't", "51:24", "know man I don't think so", "51:25", "what is the reason why they can okay", "51:29", "here we're going down a rabbit hole oh", "51:30", "let's try let's go down the Suvi rabbit", "51:32", "hole why is it okay to Suvi your food", "51:36", "and why doesn't it leak", "51:37",

I", "52:02", "don't think we're dealing with that but", "52:04", "it just it feels weird but it for as far", "52:07", "as flavor it's a phenomenal way to cook", "52:09", "a particularly wild game it's really", "52:12", "good for because again you don't", "52:13", "overcook it like if you want to cook an", "52:16", "elk steak to 130 degrees and then", "52:18", "blowtorch the outside that's what a

"52:37", "torch the outside of it to get a nice", "52:39", "you know caramelized crust and then the", "52:42", "inside you know it's perfect super", "52:43", "tender", "52:43", "yeah what does it say Jamie you don't", "52:46", "like it does it say it's gonna kill you", "52:49", "the first one just says like there's", "52:51", "after consider amount of research that's", "52:52", "been done we believe the answer is it's", "52:55", "safe and it's like they believe it is a", "52:58", "little window well I feel like if you", "53:00", "know cooking it every day like when the", "53:05", "director of The Cove was in here I", "53:06", "always fucking have a hard time saying", "53:08", "is less Soho yes", "53:10", "so hey Louie Psihoyos was in here he was", "53:12", "explaining how he was eating a lot of", "53:15", "fish before I became a vegan he he was", "53:17", "eating a ton of fish and his mercury", "53:20", "levels it really shot out", "53:22", "because a lot of fish that's like a lot", "53:24", "of fucking mercury and if you eat fish", "53:25", "for morning noon and night every day day", "53:28", "after day after day you can develop high", "53:30", "mercury mercury levels but then I talked", "53:33", "to other scientists they said yes if", "53:35", "you're eating it every day all day but", "53:37", "if you just eat it fish like once a week", "53:39", "you're fine like don't worry about it or", "53:41", "even twice a week so I was like oh did", "53:43", "they say anything cuz I remember like", "53:45", "when I think was probably when the", "53:47", "Mediterranean diet got popular people", "53:49", "were all in on salmon and stuff and", "53:51", "seafood and then it's everyone", "53:54", "wild-caught yeah and I guess that's", "53:56", "where you'd get the mercury but then", "53:58", "they would say like the farm-raised", "54:00", "salmon are not as good for you for", "54:01", "whatever reason but then I guess now", "54:04", "farm-raised is what you're supposed to", "54:05", "get because that's gonna there can", "54:06", "control that environment and make sure I", "54:08", "heard with Louise saying those that it's", "54:09", "even worse oh really", "54:11", "yeah in terms of like the heavy metals", "54:13", "and targets got to think they're just", "54:14", "sitting there yeah like it's like at", "54:16", "least in the ocean

you know it gets", "55:57", "interesting you start looking into some", "55:59", "of that stuff but uh hopefully they get", "56:01", "the the bison herd back to where they", "56:02", "need to well they

it", "59:29", "seems like something that we we'd have", "59:30", "figured out already but there's I guess", "59:32", "some nuance with that even and now we're", "59:35", "they're saying that there's

"61:23", "regenerative agricultural thing but it", "61:26", "has there it's a real evidence that you", "61:29", "can have a zero carbon gain yeah I mean", "61:33", "it's that's the that's the the the net", "61:37", "positive the idea is that if you use", "61:40", "regenerative agriculture meaning the", "61:42", "animals graze there there's you're not", "61:44", "talking to mono crop environments that", "61:47", "these cows graze on open fields of grass", "61:49", "and then they shit all over the place", "61:52", "and then you know that that shit becomes", "61:54", "manure and that this actually helps the", "61:57", "plant life grow and all this stuff sort", "62:00", "of it all becomes a part of a cycle you", "62:03", "had this regenerative practice is", "62:06", "actually instead of raising the carbon", "62:09", "footprint it actually makes a carbon", "62:11", "neutral footprint yeah yeah and I think", "62:13", "where sometimes it gets confusing is if", "62:15", "you go and you just look at", "62:16", "Studies on regenerative agriculture you", "62:18", "get a lot of mixed information so what I", "62:20", "was told and I'm still kind of going", "62:23", "down this rabbit hole and the way I like", "62:24", "to look at all these type of things is I", "62:26", "try to like look at one side of the", "62:27", "story", "62:28", "and then look to the other side and see", "62:30", "where the counters are to that and just", "62:31", "kind of go back and forth until you hit", "62:32", "a dead end and then you know if you hit", "62:34", "a dead end like that's where you're at", "62:35", "for now until you've something else gets", "62:37", "introduced and where I got to now is", "62:39", "okay I think of as maybe we'll Harris", "62:41", "told us this that when you're looking", "62:44", "for these studies on kind of what", "62:47", "practice is gonna be good in terms of", "62:49", "like soil regeneration you have to look", "62:52", "up adaptive multi paddock grazing", "62:54", "because if you look up like holistic or", "62:57", "regenerative agriculture you're going to", "62:59", "get a whole mess of like different", "63:00", "ranges are different types of it and you", "63:02", "know some are effective some aren't so", "63:03", "it's really hard to kind of piece out", "63:05", "you know who's got the accurate stuff", "63:07", "and not and I mean I think ultimately", "63:09", "some of this stuff is we just don't know", "63:11", "yet it was the one who that's most of", "63:13", "what you just an adaptive multi paddock", "63:15", "grazing and what does that mean it just", "63:17", "means like your instead of kind of your", "63:19", "your it's a rotational grazing from what", "63:21", "I understand but you're kind of moving", "63:22", "the the herd along to these different", "63:25", "products and then they're like you know", "63:27", "they're doing their thing you know what", "63:29", "would you consider like a natural way", "63:30", "likely would have been before we came in", "63:32", "and shot all the Buffalo and all that", "63:34", "stuff and then they're rotating it so", "63:37", "the way I've been on I've understood it", "63:39", "like the more of those paddocks you can", "63:40", "get the better because then you're", "63:42", "letting the the soil and the and", "63:45", "everything in there like really heal and", "63:47", "and develop that deep root system as", "63:49", "well as some of that microbiome like all", "63:51", "the insects and things that would be in", "63:52", "there right and all that stuff so you", "63:55", "would need massive amounts of land and", "63:57", "massive amounts of areas for them to", "64:00", "graze I think yeah I mean I think you", "64:02", "would need I think the more the better", "64:04", "is probably the way to look at it but", "64:07", "hopefully the the soil biologists are", "64:10", "cringing yeah I'm sure there are we", "64:12", "apologize in advance but like the", "64:13", "interesting thing though is like I mean", "64:15", "I think there's a lot of work to be done", "64:16", "in looking at this and finding out the", "64:18", "best way to maybe utilize it but the", "64:21", "thought the part that I thought was", "64:22", "really interesting is with the will", "64:24", "Harris white oak pastures thing they", "64:25", "just I think this study is maybe over", "64:28", "utilized by", "64:30", "like the the pro regenerative or multi", "64:33", "paddock group to a degree because it's", "64:35", "like it's what they have I mean it's", "64:36", "what they're looking for they're looking", "64:38", "for a specific answer meaning this is", "64:40", "good this is the way we found a way", "64:43", "where you can eat meat and not feel bad", "64:44", "yeah yeah and it's the thing that's", "64:47", "compelling about that study to me is the", "64:50", "the way it kind of happened was", "64:51", "essentially what happened was will", "64:53", "Harris and WeDo Packers they were they", "64:55", "were raising raising animals for for", "64:57", "epic bar like that that was one of their", "64:59", "buyers and epic bar got acquired by was", "65:03", "General Mills and so General Mills", "65:07", "looked at what epic bar was claiming", "65:09", "when they were the independent and they", "65:12", "were saying like our stuff is", "65:13", "regenerative ours you know you eat you", "65:15", "buy our product and you're giving back", "65:17", "versus taking kind of a mindset and I", "65:19", "think General Mills was skeptical about", "65:21", "that so they spent I think was like", "65:22", "$80,000 to go in and have a study done", "65:24", "on on will Harris's White Oaks pasture", "65:27", "to really see if they could back that", "65:29", "claim up and they went in and they did", "65:32", "the study and it actually showed like on", "65:34", "that carbon sequestration versus like", "65:37", "they weren't even neutral they actually", "65:38", "pulled in more than they put out so this", "65:41", "is from epics particular type of farming", "65:43", "that they at least at White Oaks pasture", "65:46", "so I mean again that's one specific", "65:49", "situation or one specific environment or", "65:50", "area so I think where people run into", "65:53", "maybe a potential problem is can we", "65:55", "extrapolate that forward to other areas", "65:57", "are we gonna get that same result or is", "65:59", "it gonna be different right that's", "66:01", "what's important too I mean it and it", "66:03", "really is important to look at that", "66:05", "honestly mm-hmm because even though you", "66:07", "do have this one area is that because of", "66:10", "the environment where this farm is", "66:12", "taking place is it because the", "66:13", "particular soil soil quality like what", "66:16", "are the factors that allow them to have", "66:18", "so it's it it actually takes carbon out", "66:22", "of the atmosphere like a certain", "66:24", "percentage so instead of adding carbon", "66:27", "it actually removes some yeah because I", "66:30", "guess the the way was described to me is", "66:32", "that the inputs of that type of system", "66:33", "are so low that like you're not look as", "66:36", "if you'd look at just a normal like", "66:38", "agricultural setup you know you have all", "66:41", "these inputs of like manure and all", "66:43", "these other things that are going", "66:44", "add to that then that net effect or that", "66:46", "that that net negative effect of animal", "66:49", "agriculture so when you reduce the", "66:51", "inputs down to next to nothing because", "66:53", "your inputs are all kind of just", "66:54", "manpower where you're moving these", "66:56", "things around and letting the natural", "66:57", "course of things happen all the time", "66:59", "that's where you can maybe minimize some", "67:01", "of these like I guess put you maybe call", "67:03", "out to cut tertiary damage of animal", "67:04", "agriculture but you know I think I think", "67:08", "we probably have a lot to learn and", "67:09", "stuff with that stuff too but it's one", "67:11", "of the things when I think about it's", "67:12", "like it", "67:14", "hopefully we're spending a lot of time", "67:15", "looking at that stuff because if they're", "67:17", "right about the number of harvests we", "67:19", "have left I think what is estimated we", "67:21", "have I 60 harvests left", "67:22", "I mean clearly regardless of whether", "67:24", "you're vegan carnivore or somewhere in", "67:27", "between you know we need quality soil", "67:30", "right right what about hydroponic", "67:33", "because I know that there are some", "67:35", "large-scale hydroponic operations that", "67:38", "are growing vegetables and things along", "67:40", "those lines and some people think that", "67:42", "there's real promise in that because", "67:43", "you're not you're not using soil at all", "67:46", "you're not using you're not devastating", "67:49", "they're already depleted ground soil and", "67:51", "you also don't need to do all the the", "67:54", "harmful things that are involved in mono", "67:56", "crop agriculture right like the the", "67:58", "devastation on the wildlife the", "68:01", "displacement of wildlife pesticides", "68:03", "combines they're indiscriminately", "68:06", "indiscriminately chewing up small", "68:08", "rodents and bugs and rabbits and", "68:11", "anything else that gets caught in their", "68:12", "blades yeah yeah you know that'd be", "68:15", "interesting I don't know a whole lot", "68:16", "about it other than what it is", "68:17", "so I mean I'm all for solutions yeah", "68:20", "somebody sent me a link to something", "68:22", "that some indication that there might be", "68:24", "some promise and hydroponic agriculture", "68:27", "but so but the thing about this whole", "68:31", "idea was the name of the farm were that", "68:34", "this was done where there's light oak", "68:35", "white are catchers is that sustainable", "68:38", "like nationally I'm gonna forget about", "68:39", "global ability even nationally in terms", "68:41", "of like the the needs that people have", "68:44", "for for B for me we we use so much beef", "68:46", "in this country yeah I don't know for", "68:49", "sure like what the scalability of that", "68:50", "would be my guess is like at this point", "68:53", "it would be because it's pretty small", "68:55", "like even from a percentage standpoint", "68:57", "of what is", "68:57", "how much of that type of process is", "68:59", "being used it's like a single percentage", "69:01", "or something like that so we're all", "69:04", "grass-fed meat right all grasping yeah", "69:06", "meat is like less than 3% yeah so it", "69:08", "seems like we'd have a long ways to go", "69:09", "but I mean I guess the the counter to", "69:12", "that would also be were essentially", "69:13", "going back to what we would have been", "69:15", "doing historically mm-hmm and so it's", "69:18", "not necessarily like reinventing the", "69:19", "wheel as much as it is just saying okay", "69:21", "what we did here obviously is not", "69:23", "sustainable or potentially not", "69:26", "sustainable so let's look at well what", "69:28", "did we do to get back to where we were", "69:29", "before", "69:30", "I guess maybe is the way to look at that", "69:31", "but how did you get linked up with Shawn", "69:34", "but Shawn is such a polarizing figure", "69:37", "because yes he's the carnivore go-to guy", "69:40", "and he's like a full-on carnivore zealot", "69:43", "as it were yeah I mean he doesn't even", "69:45", "he thinks vegetables are bad for me so I", "69:47", "think Shawn sometimes gets", "69:49", "misrepresented and part of it is just", "69:51", "like you know way he interacts on social", "69:52", "media and stuff but he's uh you know I", "69:56", "met Shawn like before he I think went", "69:59", "full carnivore but on Twitter and we I", "70:01", "thought he was an interesting person not", "70:02", "because of what he ate", "70:03", "so what's he doing back then was he was", "70:05", "he was kind of more like high fat low", "70:07", "carb I think something pretty similar to", "70:09", "what I've been doing", "70:10", "maybe maybe less carbohydrates since his", "70:12", "activity levels are like really short", "70:14", "and fast and you know I just thought he", "70:18", "was an interesting person because of his", "70:20", "background I mean he's you know a", "70:22", "Highlands game athlete professional", "70:24", "rugby player he's doing this", "70:26", "high-intensity gigantic yeah yeah I mean", "70:28", "he's twice my size like it so it's like", "70:30", "my thought is like okay here's a guy who", "70:32", "has a similar nutrition plan that I do", "70:34", "but he's doing the exact opposite", "70:36", "athlete type stuff he's twice the size", "70:38", "of me like if we're kind of two ends", "70:41", "that expect ends of the spectrum from", "70:43", "like an athletic standpoint so like I", "70:46", "was just interested in kind of like you", "70:47", "know what he was doing and what he was", "70:48", "up to and that's kind of why we started", "70:51", "the podcast together and but yeah I mean", "70:53", "when you one of the things that she", "70:54", "always says on the podcast I think is is", "70:56", "a kind of a better reflection I mean", "70:58", "it'll say I don't the only thing I know", "71:01", "for certain is that I'm wrong about", "71:03", "something so it's like you know it it", "71:06", "gets I think it gets tough for someone", "71:09", "like him who gets identified as the", "71:11", "the face of the carnivore movement", "71:13", "because then like you get all the", "71:15", "positive and a negative coming your way", "71:17", "too and I mean you can feed into that", "71:19", "but I mean when we when we record our", "71:22", "podcasts and stuff is he I mean he's a", "71:24", "very open-minded person we're looking", "71:26", "for answers and we're asking questions", "71:27", "and things like that and it's it's it's", "71:30", "you know it's a learning experience I", "71:32", "think for me anyway so well he clearly", "71:35", "enjoys fucking with vegans well yeah and", "71:37", "it's he's been on this fruitarian kick", "71:40", "lately which is kind of hilarious i", "71:42", "didn't know there was that many of those", "71:43", "people out there yeah one of them just", "71:45", "died one one fruitarian doctor died", "71:48", "during a fast", "71:49", "really yeah and Shaun was talking about", "71:50", "on his YouTube channel there there's", "71:52", "people out there that think that you", "71:54", "could just get by by only eating fruit", "71:55", "mmm Jesus Christ folks you know I've got", "71:58", "a theory with like social media and that", "72:00", "stuff in general is that like for a lot", "72:02", "of a lot of the people who are most", "72:04", "active on it it's like they're they", "72:06", "either take it 100% serious or it's like", "72:09", "kind of a joke or a game and then when", "72:11", "those two polar ends meet it's that's", "72:13", "where you get the big kind of like you", "72:15", "like blow up interactions and then yeah", "72:17", "and then it becomes the like kind of a", "72:19", "game of like well the vegan told me that", "72:21", "like I should die or something like that", "72:23", "so now I'm gonna go tell that vegan that", "72:24", "you know this is that and it goes back", "72:26", "and forth back and forth back so stupid", "72:27", "this is such a waste of time but the", "72:29", "most interest the one I always get a", "72:31", "kick out of though along those lines is", "72:33", "someone will come up with like a picture", "72:35", "of like here's here's the humans you", "72:38", "know jaw system and this clearly means", "72:40", "were were frugivores and then someone", "72:42", "will say well look at the the digestive", "72:44", "tract of a human being it is clearly", "72:47", "designed more to be eating meat or", "72:49", "animal products and you know they go", "72:51", "back and forth with different like parts", "72:53", "of the human anatomy to try to like", "72:55", "prove that were vegetarian or vegan", "72:58", "fruitarian organs are so stupid and then", "73:01", "I'm thinking the whole time I'm like so", "73:03", "what we have here is people who can have", "73:08", "to have specific traits that are good", "73:09", "for eating fruits and vegetables and", "73:12", "some specific traits they're good for", "73:13", "eating animal products so we're", "73:16", "omnivores it's biologically it's been", "73:20", "established not there's no real", "73:23", "controversy the controversies fake", "73:25", "look particularly from the vegans where", "73:27", "they say they were herbivores and our", "73:28", "jaws are designed to crush you know", "73:30", "right roots and shit like no no no we", "73:33", "had tools and fire yeah for fucking", "73:35", "hundreds of thousands of years you", "73:37", "knuckleheads you know who one of them of", "73:39", "my favorite podcast we've done was with", "73:41", "this guy uh dr. bill Schindler he's an", "73:44", "archaeologist I would have I think it's", "73:46", "Washington University and he's such a", "73:49", "cool dude he like totally what he said", "73:51", "something I was really resonated with me", "73:53", "where he said you know humans were were", "73:56", "unique in that like we we we've we've", "73:59", "like over time developed ways to use", "74:02", "like tools and things like that to", "74:04", "liberate nutrients so to look at", "74:06", "anything in its raw state is kind of the", "74:09", "missed the point of why humans are the", "74:10", "way they are sure we'll like lentils", "74:12", "mm-hmm right I've seen this argument", "74:15", "that human beings aren't supposed to eat", "74:16", "meat because if we were we would be able", "74:17", "to just wrap it apart and eat it with", "74:19", "our own teeth and go go eat a squirrel", "74:21", "with your face well guess what you can", "74:23", "eat a squirrel with your face if you're", "74:24", "so inclined if you really wanted to do", "74:26", "that you could do it without tools", "74:27", "uh-huh you know you can't do you can't", "74:28", "eat a lot of beans if I'm cooking them", "74:30", "like we have we've figured things out", "74:32", "folks", "74:32", "I mean cassava in the jungle they", "74:35", "figured out that you have to cook this", "74:36", "stuff and strain it and it's a primary", "74:38", "staple of the diets of many people that", "74:41", "live in the in the jungle you know and", "74:43", "it's fucking toxic is shit if you don't", "74:45", "do that I mean it literally produces", "74:47", "cyanide cyanide is produced by ska Tsavo", "74:49", "which is like one of their primary foods", "74:51", "they just figured it out just like you", "74:53", "figured out you have to boil lentils", "74:55", "just like you figured out you have to", "74:56", "cook beans uh-huh I mean you can't eat", "74:59", "most of these things that we eat are not", "75:01", "good to eat if you just eat them in", "75:03", "their raw state some things like fruits", "75:05", "are some vegetables are but some just", "75:07", "are not and this is the same with meat", "75:10", "and this this idea that you're supposed", "75:11", "to be where we're clearly an herbivore", "75:14", "because of the fact that we you know", "75:16", "we're not supposed to be you know", "75:18", "killing animals with our teeth like", "75:19", "that's so dumb like we we kill animals", "75:22", "with tools and we've done it for so long", "75:24", "that our bodies have adapted we've", "75:26", "adapted to the fact that we have clothes", "75:28", "that's why we're not covered in hair you", "75:29", "can fucking idiot like this is like real", "75:32", "clear obvious stuff people who live in", "75:35", "the coldest climates of the world", "75:37", "aren't covered in hair you know yeah you", "75:41", "know and it was interesting because like", "75:43", "what you're saying too when when we had", "75:44", "bill on the show he he's got this eunuch", "75:48", "experience what he's actually gone in", "75:49", "and visited these indigenous tribes have", "75:51", "been relatively untouched by modern", "75:52", "society to basically with the one", "75:54", "question or level how do you eat so he's", "75:56", "been he seemed like a variety of", "75:58", "different stuff I think even had a show", "75:59", "on National Geographic for a while that", "76:01", "looked into some of this but he just to", "76:04", "show you the polarization of what humans", "76:06", "can kind of do he he went he visited the", "76:09", "Sun burrow which is a branch of the", "76:11", "Maasai over in Africa you know they're", "76:13", "they're basically drinking blood and", "76:15", "milk for the for a huge portion of their", "76:18", "nutrition and you know so you have this", "76:20", "this this tribe that's basically on a", "76:22", "primarily animal-based nutrition plan", "76:24", "and they're super healthy he said that", "76:26", "there may be one of the most healthy", "76:28", "groups of people he's seen from just", "76:29", "like a physical stature like toothed", "76:31", "health and that sort of thing but then", "76:33", "he also went down to I think was in", "76:35", "South America camera the name of the", "76:36", "tribe but they found a way to basically", "76:39", "liberate nutrients from a poisonous", "76:41", "potato and Sabah is that what it was me", "76:44", "that's what we're talking about okay", "76:45", "yeah um yeah so I think it was maybe was", "76:48", "cassava or maybe there's other ones yeah", "76:50", "they think there is a purple some weird", "76:53", "purple potato that has a similar sort of", "76:55", "a toxic profile yeah and what he said", "76:58", "was this this tribe they're a basically", "77:00", "mostly potatoes what they would do is", "77:02", "they'd literally dig like a pit and put", "77:04", "like some like like thousands of pounds", "77:07", "of these potatoes in there and let them", "77:08", "sit there and like ferment I guess for", "77:10", "like up into six months oh and then they", "77:13", "would actually make this a clay that", "77:15", "they would use and because there was", "77:16", "still a toxin or something though that", "77:17", "they needed to kind of prevent from like", "77:20", "interacting Oh some totally different", "77:22", "yeah so they would they take that this", "77:24", "clay and as a potato and when they dip", "77:25", "the potato in this clay its it like", "77:28", "binds to that toxin so it becomes it", "77:30", "doesn't become an issue when you eat it", "77:31", "so like by itself that potato could", "77:33", "potentially kill you I guess but with", "77:34", "the clay it doesn't and so I was like", "77:37", "how the fuck did they figure that out", "77:39", "that's what I want to know I'm thinking", "77:40", "like how much trial and error goes into", "77:42", "that it's like oh this guy dropped dead", "77:43", "this guy dropped oh this guy lived I", "77:45", "guess there's so many things like that", "77:47", "in the jungle you just have to really", "77:48", "wonder how do they develop all these", "77:50", "different menace", "77:51", "all these different ways of eating thing", "77:53", "it's just fascinating when like your I", "77:54", "guess when your only goal when you wake", "77:56", "up in the morning is to find your next", "77:57", "meal yeah and you know kind of build", "78:00", "build enough around so that you can kind", "78:02", "of survive like you put a lot of time", "78:04", "and energy into it but yeah it is", "78:06", "interesting to think like how they all", "78:07", "got passed along from generation to", "78:09", "generation and how it got fine-tuned to", "78:11", "where it is today", "78:12", "but I think it's it's cool to look at", "78:14", "that stuff when it just comes to your", "78:16", "own nutrition too and kind of when you", "78:18", "understand like it's less about like", "78:19", "this food is net bad for me or this this", "78:23", "food is this particular food item is bad", "78:25", "for me across the board and this one is", "78:27", "great for me across

you get get the profile", "78:36", "that you're looking for", "78:37", "yeah I think the problem is what we're", "78:38", "saying before is that people are", "78:40", "entering into these

interesting to", "84:52", "see where they get with with that and", "84:54", "and everything else with that and you", "84:55", "know it you brought up an interesting", "84:56", "point too not to keep going down the", "84:59", "rabbit hole but the other thing that I", "85:01", "thought really interesting was when you", "85:04", "look at waste components I feel like", "85:05", "we're not maybe looking at that as much", "85:07", "as as we should be when we're talking", "85:08", "about trying to feed a bunch of people's", "85:10", "like well maybe we should start with", "85:11", "what we're throwing away that we", "85:12", "wouldn't have - oh yeah and I think like", "85:15", "at first I just thought like well you", "85:17", "know there's a lot of food thrown away", "85:18", "at restaurants there's a lot of stuff", "85:19", "that's thrown away just because it", "85:20", "doesn't meet standards for like the", "85:22", "grocery store it's like let's start", "85:23", "there and I actually had asked dr.", "85:26", "Schindler about that he actually did a", "85:27", "study with some of his grad students", "85:29", "where they looked at I think I took 30", "85:32", "white-tailed

you go and you shoot a deer", "85:44", "and then you could take it to the the", "85:45", "process and get it all done he said it", "85:47", "was between I think it was between like", "85:49", "13 to 30 days worth of human nutrition", "85:52", "that gets wasted you know a single", "85:54", "white-tailed deer so like well here's", "85:57", "the problem with that idea a waste is", "85:59", "only if you do something with it if you", "86:02", "leave it in the field there's no waste", "86:03", "right but if you just killed a deer that", "86:06", "it's not it just left it there there's", "86:08", "no waste it's you're feeding animals", "86:10", "right I mean they're going to absolutely", "86:13", "destroy that thing it's gonna be gone in", "86:15", "a short period of time including the", "86:17", "bone so it'll delete the bones and if", "86:18", "they don't eat the bones the bones will", "86:19", "eventually deteriorate and become part", "86:21", "of the soil this is what happens when", "86:23", "animals die sure so I guess maybe the", "86:26", "way to look at them is like what are we", "86:27", "if we're looking to just if our", "86:29", "objective is to feed as many people as", "86:30", "possible and we're maximizing the amount", "86:32", "of nutrients we can acquire from a", "86:34", "specific thing like we're leaving a lot", "86:36", "on the table or we're giving a lot to", "86:37", "different areas like different animals", "86:39", "and things that are going well we're", "86:40", "doing it wrong you know we're putting", "86:42", "our waste and bags and",

the", "86:51", "methane comes from they were trying to", "86:53", "go it's fuckin landfills man landfills", "86:55", "are disgusting and this is not how it's", "86:59", "supposed to be it's supposed to be", "87:00", "animals so are supposed to have access", "87:03", "to what's left over I mean this is what", "87:06", "would happen if a bear killed a moose", "87:08", "all right if a bear killed a moose", "87:09", "that's gonna consume a big portion of", "87:11", "the body and then it's gonna leave", "87:13", "whatever is left and then rodents and", "87:15", "vultures and and then eventually insects", "87:18", "and bacteria are gonna break it down and", "87:20", "this is a natural cycle of life for", "87:23", "animals this is how it's supposed to be", "87:25", "what we do is we take it we cut it up we", "87:29", "eat some of it we throw some of it away", "87:32", "we put that in a plastic bag we zip tie", "87:35", "it we've did a fucking hole in the", "87:37", "ground and we throw that bag in there", "87:39", "it's not it's ludicrous", "87:40", "yeah it's we know better we do know", "87:42", "better we understand the whole process", "87:45", "of these things breaking down in the", "87:47", "wild and what happens to them we", "87:50", "understand there's animals that their", "87:52", "entire diet consists of eating animals", "87:55", "that other animals have killed and they", "87:57", "leave some of it behind that's we're", "88:00", "supposed to leave it behind it's", "88:01", "supposed to be a part of the whole cycle", "88:03", "of life we were supposed to compost all", "88:05", "these things are supposed to be natural", "88:07", "weed you know when I was a kid my mom", "88:11", "and my stepdad were part of this", "88:12", "cooperative farm thing and we started", "88:16", "composting and I'm we didn't do it for", "88:18", "very long because we eventually wound up", "88:20", "moving and we stopped we stopped being a", "88:22", "part of this thing but I thought it was", "88:24", "really interesting because I was a", "88:25", "little kid or thing like oh I never", "88:27", "thought of that before you take your", "88:29", "food waste and you separate it from like", "88:32", "paper uh-huh give your paper waste and", "88:34", "then you have like leftover tomatoes or", "88:36", "something like that and all that would", "88:37", "go into one specific bin and that bin", "88:41", "would go into this big thing it was like", "88:42", "it was made with like chicken wire and", "88:45", "leaves and you had a lid over it and", "88:47", "like it was a wood box and you would", "88:49", "throw everything in there and it would", "88:51", "all sort of rot in compost and then you", "88:53", "would take that stuff and you would use", "88:56", "it in the garden", "88:57", "and this is this is how composting is", "89:00", "done this is how fertilizer is made and", "89:02", "this is what you're supposed to do yeah", "89:03", "this is like small-scale regenerative", "89:06", "farming and what we're doing is assholes", "89:09", "we take our food we put in fucking bags", "89:11", "we zip tie it shut and we chuck it in", "89:14", "the ground it's dumb it's a really dumb", "89:16", "way of doing things I just feel like", "89:18", "that there's something that we could", "89:20", "really leverage at the educational level", "89:23", "like yeah we've got schools where we we", "89:25", "were housing these kids and like you", "89:27", "know one of the biggest hurdles I think", "89:29", "is like we got them indoors sitting in", "89:30", "desks for seven eight hours a day and", "89:32", "then we what why not get them out and", "89:35", "learn that and do that and we have these", "89:36", "mini little like regenerative areas sure", "89:39", "then you learn it and then it doesn't", "89:41", "get forgotten when you're an adult as", "89:42", "easily but we're so enamoured with this", "89:44", "idea of working you know we're so", "89:46",

and I", "100:47", "think in my own training like I get that", "100:49", "from a lot of different workouts but the", "100:52", "one that I really love is like when I", "100:54", "get closer to a race and I was saying", "100:56", "before you start dialing things in to be", "100:57", "more specific to the to the activity", "100:59", "you're trying to prepare for I'll do a", "101:01", "phase of training where I'm running kind", "101:03", "of in an area of about like 150 155", "101:06", "beats per minute so I can go like on a", "101:08", "it's it's just fast enough where I feel", "101:09", "like I'm really kind of like working but", "101:12", "it's also slow know if I can go for", "101:13", "quite a while so I can like log a really", "101:15", "big run and when I was training for this", "101:18", "last race that at the Pettit Center I", "101:21", "had a training cycle where I hit I had a", "101:25", "four-week block where I had one D load", "101:28", "week which is basically reduction of", "101:29", "volume and intensity and three billers", "101:31", "recalls D low d load because I'm like", "101:32", "reducing volume and intensity and the", "101:35", "other three though were build up on-site", "101:36", "like 130 mile week some right around", "101:38", "hundred thirty and then 250 mile weeks", "101:40", "and they were just like basically loaded", "101:42", "with like kind of just faster than or", "101:45", "right about kind of hundred mile", "101:46", "intensity so you know I would do and you", "101:49", "can maybe pull it up I think I have a", "101:50", "picture on my Instagram page of the I", "101:52", "did these key workouts where I'd go to a", "101:54", "track and I would just do loops around", "101:55", "the track and it'd be like anywhere", "101:57", "between 27 to like 32 miles at that kind", "102:01", "of intensity and you just get into like", "102:03", "a flow and a rhythm and it just once you", "102:05", "kind of get moving it feels great and", "102:07", "afterwards yeah you you feel great the", "102:09", "whole rest of the day and you just want", "102:10", "to kind of go and do it again you almost", "102:12", "have to be careful not to not to do too", "102:13", "much but who structures those do you", "102:16", "structure them yourself yeah yeah it's", "102:18", "going to go back to where", "102:19", "in the beginning like when I structure a", "102:21", "plan ideally I start out I start out", "102:23", "with a good base a good aerobic base", "102:25", "which I typically kind of retain almost", "102:27", "year-round I'll take like offseason but", "102:29", "I like to follow principle where I'll", "102:31", "let myself kind of lose some of that", "102:33", "peak fitness just so it's sustainable", "102:34", "because staying at your peak fitness", "102:36", "level is not sustainable", "102:37", "so I let myself get like just out of", "102:40", "shape enough so that I'm not always at", "102:42", "that level and then I start kind of", "102:45", "building in the structure towards the", "102:48", "race itself which starts with those", "102:49", "shorter faster intervals since they're", "102:51", "further away and then I get closer and", "102:53", "closer to the race where I'm doing", "102:56", "things that are more specific so like", "102:57", "the next step would be I'd be doing some", "102:59", "longer intervals or kind of like what", "103:01", "you consider like an anaerobic threshold", "103:02", "type workout which generally speaking is", "103:05", "about like your max intensity if you did", "103:07", "like a 60-minute all-out time trial and", "103:09", "then you know that's still not specific", "103:11", "to 100 miles because I'm out there for", "103:12", "11 hours so I'm kind of still moving", "103:14", "closer to that slower race pace", "103:17", "yeah and it's a it may just follows the", "103:20", "principle of you know hitting all the", "103:22", "systems of training like you would in", "103:24", "any other paradise endurance plan but", "103:26", "always keeping that compass of the stuff", "103:28", "you do for the earth intensity of the", "103:31", "race itself is the type of work you", "103:33", "should be doing closest to it so you're", "103:34", "really just optimizing when you're", "103:36", "closer to the race itself how do you", "103:39", "know what your peak fitness is like when", "103:41", "you say that you wanna you can't really", "103:43", "maintain the peak fitness you want to", "103:45", "back off a little bit so that you can", "103:47", "just keep your your training running how", "103:49", "do you know where that is and how do you", "103:51", "know that you cannot expand that and", "103:53", "then ya know that's a great question", "103:55", "that's somewhat subjective too I mean", "103:57", "you can analyze things if you want to go", "103:59", "into like heart rate variability type", "104:01", "things if you but that's a little more", "104:03", "on the micro level for me personally", "104:05", "like usually I'll get to a point where", "104:07", "like I'll do a race and you know you can", "104:10", "just kind of tell like I'm exhausted", "104:11", "from that and I like to think of it kind", "104:13", "of two folded where like physical", "104:16", "recovery and mental recovery so if I do", "104:18", "a big race and afterwards like I can't", "104:21", "even like bring myself to think of", "104:24", "another big training block I know I need", "104:25", "to like let myself kind of get a little", "104:28", "bit out of that fitness state that peak", "104:30", "fitness state and just kind of reset or", "104:32", "hidden", "104:32", "that button this is just from years and", "104:34", "years Tyler and you mission stakes I", "104:37", "mean in the past you know a lot of times", "104:39", "they'll do well big I think I got one", "104:41", "more race left for me then it goes badly", "104:43", "right now what is a long day like say if", "104:47", "you're getting prepared for this", "104:49", "100-mile race and you know you're gonna", "104:50", "have to run for 11 plus hours", "104:52", "what's a long day for you yeah so the", "104:55", "longest run I did for this particular", "104:57", "one was three and a half hours it was I", "104:59", "think 32 miles or something somewhere in", "105:01", "that neighborhood I'll do I'll do", "105:04", "I usually don't push up much past five", "105:06", "hours in my own training if I'm gonna do", "105:09", "much more than that I'll just jump in a", "105:10", "race like the nice thing about Phoenix", "105:13", "is there's a race company called air", "105:14", "Viper and they put on like 30-some ultra", "105:17", "events every year so it's not Wow you", "105:18", "can basically it's almost every weekend", "105:20", "pretty much yeah that's crazy", "105:22", "so like the the guy who raced direct at", "105:24", "jamil he he'll he'll let me jump in", "105:26", "events when I want to and so sometimes", "105:28", "all if I'm gonna do something like say I", "105:30", "want to preparing for 100 mile and I", "105:32", "want to get a really long day like a", "105:33", "seven eight hour session in you know", "105:36", "I'll just pick like a like a hundred K", "105:38", "type event or like you know a 50 mile or", "105:40", "type event and just do that at like I", "105:42", "like to say like I try to eat those are", "105:44", "you know those a training tool so I", "105:46", "don't want to necessarily race it all", "105:47", "out but if you can kind of keep yourself", "105:49", "out like maybe 80% of what you're", "105:50", "capable of you can get that good long", "105:52", "stimulus but not necessarily beat", "105:53", "yourself up so much that it takes away", "105:55", "from the race you're preparing for and", "105:56", "so 50 miles would take you or how long", "106:00", "would that take you it depends on the", "106:01", "course like I just did a 50-miler", "106:03", "actually about a week and a half ago", "106:05", "called the JFK 50-mile that took me five", "106:07", "hours and 42 minutes and that course is", "106:09", "kind of it's got you go over the", "106:11", "Appalachian Mountains for about 60 miles", "106:14", "and you get on a really flat toe path", "106:15", "for about a marathon and then some", "106:17", "rolling Street Hills so that's not as", "106:19", "fast as you can find you can find I mean", "106:21", "you can go on a track how much elevation", "106:23", "you're going down that one was about", "106:25", "3,000 feet so haha it is but the funny", "106:28", "thing about ultramarathon especially in", "106:30", "north america is like you know the", "106:31", "trails are where a lot of you know", "106:33", "there's a lot of interest there so 3,000", "106:36", "450 is actually considered a relatively", "106:37", "flat fast course whoa", "106:39", "you know it's hilarious it's really", "106:41", "interesting too because like some of the", "106:43", "I live just about two hours south of", "106:45", "Flagstaff", "106:46", "and there's a group of ultramarathon", "106:48", "guys who train up there and they I got a", "106:51", "lot of inspiration from from two of them", "106:53", "specifically for this last race that", "106:54", "race it at the Petitte Center and one", "106:57", "guy's name is Jim Walmsley and he's from", "107:00", "my money probably the best ultra", "107:02", "marathoner we have certainly in North", "107:04", "America if not the world I mean he he's", "107:08", "got the course record at the western", "107:09", "states 100 which is the most tested", "107:11", "hundred mile er in North America", "107:13", "he's got the course record at the Lake", "107:15", "Sonoma 50-mile by a pretty big margin", "107:17", "he's actually got the two fastest times", "107:19", "but the next closest person him is like", "107:21", "18 minutes behind or something like that", "107:23", "and then he's also got the course record", "107:25", "the JFK 50-mile the one I just was", "107:27", "mentioning before and these three events", "107:29", "are three of the most tested courses", "107:32", "that we've had and he's got the course", "107:34", "records at all of them and he can", "107:35", "probably go faster so I mean some of his", "107:39", "training is like he'll do like 150 mile", "107:42", "week sometimes with like 30,000 feet of", "107:44", "climbing and ascending and the kicker is", "107:47", "one of his training partners Jared Hazen", "107:49", "so if Jim is the best ultra runner in", "107:51", "North America has from the male side", "107:53", "Jared Hazen is by far the most", "107:55", "underrated so this guy he ran the", "107:59", "western states 100 this year", "108:00",

"118:27", "comes to like a leader I think and I", "118:29", "think in the current especially in the", "118:31", "current climate like you know our", "118:32", "leaders today tend to be you know

that are", "119:26", "good for Humanity but oftentimes they", "119:29", "don't necessarily have that example to", "119:30", "kind of like to lead the way then they", "119:33", "they look into a void in some cases and", "119:35", "I think Justin is the type of person who", "119:37", "you know if the more people we can get", "119:39", "to know about him his story and what", "119:41", "he's trying

weeks", "128:00", "where it's like 50 mile day 50 mile a 50", "128:02", "mile day like you know like 350 400 mile", "128:05", "weeks and stuff like that and then if", "128:06", "you like zoomed in on

yeah reach out to him he'll be", "129:10", "good about it I think yeah yeah yeah", "129:11", "he's a nice guy I know Pete so how many", "129:13", "people have done this run hey you know I", "129:15", "don't even know it's been it's a", "129:16", "documented route so it's been done done", "129:19", "you could probably google it and find", "129:21", "out and I'll buddy I it's it's probably", "129:24", "it's more than you'd think", "129:25", "it just really usually comes down and", "129:27", "actually you just and work with someone", "129:29", "earlier who did it walking I think I", "129:31", "think a maybe was a slightly different", "129:32", "route but it was basically the same", "129:34", "premise and he walked like some 20-some", "129:38", "miles a day or something like that and", "129:39", "was raising raising funds and awareness", "129:41", "for fight for the Forgotten - so we'll", "129:45", "maybe talk to him a bit - so um", "129:48", "the idea is late summer early fall", "129:50", "something like that yeah that's probably", "129:52", "ideal I think you want to try to catch", "129:55", "you want to get away from winter but you", "129:57", "also want to be done before the the", "129:59", "worst part of summer right with the", "130:02", "global warming do you factor that in", "130:04", "depends how fast ends up coming the", "130:08", "route might be shorter by the time I get", "130:10", "around to doing it if the coasts come in", "130:11", "though so sometime around this time next", "130:14", "year it should be completed is that the", "130:16", "idea", "130:17", "um maybe yeah my thought is it's", "130:20", "probably got to either be about like you", "130:22", "know a ten month like start point or 18", "130:26", "so I could either do it now or I guess", "130:28", "to be a little less than 18 but by", "130:30", "finishing so I would either maybe try to", "130:32", "do it like this fall or if I don't have", "130:35", "enough in place by then target kind of", "130:38", "the end of winter for 2021 and what", "130:40", "would change what would make you decide", "130:42", "to do it 20:21 versus twenty twenty uh", "130:45", "justjust I mean I'm trying to respect", "130:47", "how much like planning it's going to", "130:49", "take and I haven't really started that", "130:51", "yet so I don't want to like necessarily", "130:53", "get to find out like okay let's say I", "130:57", "just put a date on the on the calendar", "130:58", "right away and then find out oh I need", "131:00", "to like and there's a lot more resources", "131:02", "I have to try to acquire to make this", "131:03", "happen and in this in terms of logistics", "131:05", "like mostly logistics getting everything", "131:08", "just organized enough to because I don't", "131:11", "want to screw it up", "131:13", "so there's that too and then also", "131:15", "planning around my own race schedule to", "131:16", "a degree too so obviously this will", "131:20", "probably this will take the place of an", "131:22", "the way I look at like seasons of racing", "131:25", "is just kind of two key ones you have", "131:27", "like your spring early summer and you're", "131:29", "kind of late summer fall / winter season", "131:32", "so it's kind of - so I'll basically just", "131:35", "sacrifice one of those seasons for this", "131:37", "and I probably won't I mean I don't", "131:40", "really know what to expect I've never", "131:41", "done anything quite like this before but", "131:43", "I'm planning on dedicating one of those", "131:46", "seasons towards that exclusively it's", "131:48", "Jamie's nodding over here he's guys", "131:49", "digging through this article is pretty", "131:50", "interesting so it started here like this", "131:53",

"maybe go full circle we started before", "134:34", "where we kind of talked about kind of", "134:35", "what I peered eyes with carbohydrates", "134:37", "and stuff like that where I think there", "134:39", "is a point where the distance is long", "134:41", "enough where like a strict ketogenic", "134:43", "diet is maybe more applicable I think", "134:46", "it's very pretty pretty

"ketogenic like for a long long time now", "135:57", "try to get him on board for this attempt", "135:58", "but like the what I'm trying to say with", "136:01", "that is like he'd probably help you yeah", "136:03", "yeah I'm give you a great resource for", "136:05", "sure", "136:06", "but like for something like this like my", "136:08", "intensities gonna be so low that like I", "136:11", "don't technically need to be taking in", "136:13", "exogenous glucose for something like", "136:14", "that so it might actually be move me to", "136:16", "be as fat adapted as I can get versus", "136:19",

in", "136:26", "race nutrition fueling play I was always", "136:28", "under the impression that your body", "136:29", "always knows what to do with glucose but", "136:32", "that it has to be fat adapted that's", "136:33", "yeah I say I I think you probably can to", "136:36", "a degree but what happens is like you", "136:38", "you down regulates like I can't speak to", "136:41", "the science perfectly but Trent's", "136:44", "telling worth did a bunch of research", "136:45", "where it basically it down regulates the", "136:48", "mechanism that allows you to take in", "136:49", "glucose and utilize it in a meaningful", "136:51", "way so like you know most people can", "136:54", "tolerate probably somewhere between", "136:56", "maybe mmm 60 to 90 grams of glucose per", "137:01", "hour during some of these events whereas", "137:03", "like if you went on a strict zero carb", "137:05", "diet and tried to do 6 to 90 grams of a", "137:08", "sports drink or fuel or something like", "137:10", "that like I don't think your body could", "137:11", "clear it because it would have down", "137:13", "regulated the your body's capability to", "137:15", "do that so many folks who are interested", "137:17", "should look at trance telling what's", "137:19", "work", "137:19", "he he would be able to describe it in", "137:22", "much better detail than I can oh you", "137:25", "would just go on a real super heavy fat", "137:27", "I think so that's where I'm that's what", "137:28", "I'm thinking about I wouldn't", "137:29", "necessarily Otto's coconut oil", "137:31", "yeah meat yeah there's main line those", "137:34", "f-bombs yeah i think a lot of fat and a", "137:38", "lot of protein would be the name the", "137:39", "game for something that that's that low", "137:41", "and that or that slow intensity and you", "137:44", "would try for how many miles a day well", "137:46", "Pete did it in 70 so I feel like it", "137:48", "would be cool to try to challenge his", "137:50", "his his attempt but uh", "137:53", "how many hours was he doing a day I", "137:55", "don't know that's a good question I'd", "137:56", "have to look back and see what he was", "137:58", "doing if it don't know if it was", "137:59", "consistent leave the same every day so", "138:01", "maybe that's where my plan would deviate", "138:03", "and I'm probably gonna learn along the", "138:05", "way and maybe change things but I do", "138:06", "kind of like at least on paper that idea", "138:08", "of targeting a 12 to 14 hour window so", "138:11", "that I have at least 10 hours to kind of", "138:13", "like refuel and sleep and stay on top of", "138:15", "that stuff and what if that'll likely", "138:17", "mean is like maybe there'll be some days", "138:18", "where I go well past 70 miles maybe", "138:21", "it'll be some days where I go well under", "138:22", "and you just hope that the your average", "138:24", "to get the record but the records kind", "138:26", "of secondary
