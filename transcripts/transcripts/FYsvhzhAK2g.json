real that's real", "02:18", "god damn man I get to 210 I'm like this", "02:21", "is how long do you do it to 20 well it", "02:23", "depends on how how cold you go into it", "02:26", "oh so if you're if your body if your", "02:28", "core temperature is way down you can you", "02:31", "know it if you if you got off a", "02:33", "stationary bike and your core was nice", "02:35", "and hot and you

such good adapters or our", "04:11", "you know our adaptation is amazing and", "04:14", "you do some stuff for a while I think", "04:16", "you do it pretty soon you're like oh I", "04:18", "can handle a you know an assault by", "04:20", "again at a survivable pace you know you", "04:23", "survive that's a rough machine rough", "04:26", "machine I have the rogue version yeah", "04:28", "echo bike

and", "04:53", "suffering you were explaining nose", "04:55", "breathing to me out there yeah how nose", "04:57", "breathing is better better for you", "04:59", "because of well first of all you were", "05:01", "designed to breathe your sinuses and", "05:04", "your nose were designed for breathing", "05:06", "and so you actually admit a gas in your", "05:09", "sinuses from my understanding a gas", "05:12", "called nitric oxide which is a", "05:14", "vasodilator it helps you absorb oxygen", "05:16", "so by breathing through your nose plus", "05:18", "you reduce the amount of intake that you", "05:20", "have and that gets you co2 tolerance so", "05:23", "all of a sudden you're breathing less", "05:25", "volume I mean you know from the fight", "05:27", "game as soon as a guy goes to mouth", "05:29", "breathing you're like this is toast you", "05:31", "know that right that's your first", "05:32", "giveaway so your ability to deal with", "05:35", "stress and breathe through your nose I", "05:37", "mean everybody should be breathing", "05:39", "through their nose in their sleep", "05:41", "walking around I mean we somehow we", "05:44", "became mouth breathers in the last 200", "05:47", "years and they're not sure why there's a", "05:49", "great book called the oxygen advantage", "05:51", "by Patrick MacDougall that he actually", "05:54", "is on our board of xpt but he he you", "05:57", "know kind of realized that our issues", "05:59", "really stem from mouth breathing chronic", "06:01", "mouth breathing which is scrubbing our", "06:03", "co2 and keeping our co2 levels down", "06:06", "which is the marker to absorb oxygen so", "06:09", "when your co2 levels are down you don't", "06:12", "absorb the oxygen from your bloodstream", "06:14", "the cells don't take it as soon as the", "06:15", "co2 goes up then the then the body", "06:17", "starts to pull it out of the blood", "06:19", "interesting so smaller amounts by", "06:21", "breathing through the nose actually", "06:22", "makes you absorb more oxygen well it", "06:25", "keeps your tolerance yeah but definitely", "06:27", "gets your co2 tolerant up but the", "06:29", "smaller volume helps your body become", "06:32", "more tolerant of higher levels of co2", "06:33", "but the note the sinuses themselves emit", "06:37", "that helps the lung absorb the oxygen is", "06:39", "and that's you know that's what I've", "06:41", "been led to understand I had a broken", "06:43", "nose and tell us 40 my nose was useless", "06:45", "I couldn't get anything out of it it had", "06:48", "been broken like who knows how many", "06:50", "times yeah it was all the inside was all", "06:51", "caked up with scar tissue and calcified", "06:54", "and when I got it fixed it was like the", "06:56", "world changed it was like I couldn't do", "06:59", "that I just couldn't breathe out of my", "07:00", "nose yeah I would go to yoga class he'd", "07:02", "tell me to breathe out oh I knows I'm", "07:03", "like I don't have one yeah I could smell", "07:04", "farts yeah that's it I could smell gas", "07:06", "and gasoline like it has to be rough", "07:09", "yeah for me to smell it yeah now I have", "07:11", "a real nose yeah I always encourage", "07:13", "people pull it if you have a broken nose", "07:14", "please get that deviated septum fixed", "07:16", "well you know surprising if you start to", "07:19", "nose breathe even if you have struggle", "07:21", "because of the that gas helps you open", "07:24", "up a lot of people I mean you know I'm", "07:26", "not saying that you have that but a lot", "07:28", "of people actually will gain volume", "07:30", "after a few weeks of forcing themselves", "07:32", "in nose breathe they'll actually start", "07:34", "to open up all of that that system does", "07:37", "that make sense so it's your body just", "07:39", "adapt and try it forces it to open but", "07:42", "ya know it's all about nose breathing", "07:44", "you know I didn't think I just thought", "07:47", "it was just more difficult so it's", "07:48", "probably a good thing to do for", "07:49", "discipline absolutely and if you can do", "07:51", "your cardio and and retain a nose breath", "07:55", "you're you're you have another gear", "07:57", "because any when you go to mouth it's", "07:58", "like you got a it's like having a you", "08:00", "know blower in your car or something you", "08:02", "open up they you know you open up the", "08:04", "air and it's a whole new game so by", "08:07", "being able to sustain a high-output up", "08:09", "with nose breathing then and like I said", "08:11", "it's all about the tolerance for co2", "08:13", "it's how much co2 you can handle in your", "08:15", "system you know like that's why", "08:17", "altitudes screws people up because the", "08:18", "co2 jacks up and they don't have a", "08:20", "tolerance and then you get all wonky and", "08:22", "you feel like crap yeah it's it's", "08:24", "interesting you're talking about", "08:25", "cravings because one of the things that", "08:28", "I've noticed since I've been I cranked", "08:29", "up the to the the temperature in the", "08:31", "sauna for the first week to 200 degrees", "08:33", "that I've been doing 210 for the last", "08:34", "few days and you crave it now I crave it", "08:38", "like when I'm at home I'm like can't", "08:39", "wait to get back to that goddamn song", "08:40", "again meanwhile when I'm in there I", "08:42", "can't wait to get out it's weird", "08:45", "there what then lies the struggle yeah I", "08:47", "mean the ice is the same way like I", "08:49", "an addiction to ice and I you know", "08:51", "recently I've been just came back from", "08:53", "Hawaii and I'm like dealing with this", "08:55", "ice machines broken down I'm waiting for", "08:57", "the new one I keep calling the guy and", "08:58", "go hey what are you gonna put the thing", "08:59", "in and he's thinking it's like a luxury", "09:01", "like yeah you know you got it what do", "09:02", "you mean an ice machine at your house", "09:03", "for him because I have a to like", "09:05", "restaurant sized ones of them yeah well", "09:08", "I have a lot of friends but buddy he's", "09:11", "like what do you need that for and I'm", "09:12", "like I'd like just just get you know I", "09:14", "got the tubs I'm like I'm but my body", "09:17", "craves you get it listen your body is", "09:20", "just craving the things that are", "09:22", "bringing the hormones and do it I mean", "09:24", "it's like why you crave exercise you", "09:26", "know I have a theory that the reason why", "09:27", "people are hooked to cardio activity is", "09:30", "because it's forced breathing that", "09:32", "people because you wouldn't willingly", "09:34", "just sit on your floor and breathe heavy", "09:35", "for an hour so your body's like okay", "09:37", "let's go for rent like let's go you need", "09:39", "to run you better run you better run and", "09:41", "then you go run and then the body gets", "09:42", "that absorption of all gets a tox again", "09:45", "then it really wants the feel I feel", "09:47", "like there's probably several factors", "09:49", "because also I feel like when I'm really", "09:51", "consistent with my workouts I know that", "09:53", "I'm gaining momentum and I know like I", "09:55", "you know I'm consistent everything's", "09:57", "going great I mean great shape right now", "09:59", "I got to keep pushing this yeah that", "10:01", "feels like it's it feels like a like", "10:03", "just just positive results are being", "10:05", "achieved and you can sort of get", "10:06", "addicted to success well and but also to", "10:09", "the body the adaptation if you ever put", "10:11", "yourself under some real severe stress", "10:13", "in multiple days the first day you feel", "10:15", "like you're not gonna be able to make it", "10:17", "the second day you're feeling you know", "10:18", "like you can't really can't make it the", "10:20", "third pretty soon the fourth day the", "10:21", "body is like oh this is the new house", "10:23", "we're living in like this is where we're", "10:25", "at okay well we're gonna adapt and", "10:27", "modify and then pretty soon you're doing", "10:28", "even more your than you were doing the", "10:30", "first couple days and you're not even", "10:31", "feeling it yeah and so it's like we're", "10:34", "that we're an amazing an amazing machine", "10:38", "you know we're an amazing creature just", "10:40", "the way we can handle the load and", "10:43", "especially in this in our new world", "10:45", "where we you know don't have to do much", "10:49", "you know Eddie Izzard is yeah the", "10:52", "comedian yeah yeah yeah he he ran a", "10:54", "series of marathons all around the UK", "10:56", "yeah I did one in South Africa and he", "10:59", "was on the two weeks ago and he was", "11:00", "telling me that when", "11:01", "you first started doing it like the", "11:03", "first few were really hard but then your", "11:06", "body's like well this is what we do we", "11:07", "run marathons and then like day three", "11:09", "day four things started picking up

ran", "12:06", "across the country that's how he got", "12:08", "there so he did a marathon I took a nap", "12:12", "yeah eat some food ran a marathon taken", "12:14", "a piece of what the fuck just shows you", "12:19", "that you know that ability to adapt and", "12:22", "what we can you know what we can do it's", "12:24", "amazing how the body will just when you", "12:26", "push it and you keep it'll just be like", "12:28", "it'll ramp I mean and I think for us in", "12:31", "this in our new world that we live in", "12:33", "that seems so crazy but probably in the", "12:37", "past you were like oh yeah well we went", "12:39", "all the way down to South America and we", "12:40", "did some hunting down there and then we", "12:42", "you know Trek a marathon or two per day", "12:45", "and we came all the way back to Alaska", "12:46", "you know like right you know that was", "12:50", "just our life yeah well especially when", "12:52", "they used to persistence hunt you know", "12:54", "when they would just run an animal down", "12:56", "yeah animals yeah are great for Sprint's", "12:58", "yeah especially like gazelles and things", "13:00", "along those lines but you know what you", "13:01", "know what the real technique really is", "13:04", "based on is that are breathing that", "13:06", "breathing is what gives us we have an", "13:08", "ability to adjust our breath so we can", "13:11", "actually adjust how many times we", "13:13", "breathe per motion", "13:14", "where a lot of these animals are", "13:16", "breathing for a rep every rep is a", "13:18", "breath so every step is and we can do", "13:22", "multiple steps in one breath and so that", "13:24", "why our that's why we can outrun a horse", "13:26", "at the end of the day you always see the", "13:28", "in the cowboy movies the horse is laying", "13:29", "dead in the desert and the guys still", "13:31", "going along but because the those", "13:34", "mammals are breathing every breath is a", "13:37", "rep and you imagine how tiring that is", "13:39", "like you're a horse right right they're", "13:42", "breathing every and we're we running", "13:43", "full speed but we can just do a breath", "13:45", "and then do five or six or eight reps", "13:48", "and that gives us that endurance that's", "13:50", "why we can run those gazelles down", "13:52", "because those guys are just breathe", "13:53", "they're their breath down that's", "13:56", "interesting well I'm always very", "13:58", "appreciative of guys like you that are", "14:01", "in my age range your speed limit yeah", "14:05", "yeah limit your but you're also very fit", "14:09", "and very active and you keep going", "14:11", "whereas a lot of guys around 55 like", "14:14", "it's a wrap turn off the car yeah", "14:16", "there's not much in the tank and so I'd", "14:19", "like to see guys that are in my age", "14:21", "bracket a little bit ahead of me like oh", "14:23", "he's going go I can keep going to go", "14:25", "full spin I think a lot of that is just", "14:27", "thinking and knowing that you can", "14:29", "because I think so many people feel like", "14:32", "hey I'm 45 it's time to settle down it's", "14:34", "time to relax", "14:35", "you know and wind down this exercise you", "14:37", "know you know I think but daily I think", "14:40", "people use that as just a disclaimer do", "14:42", "not do the work it's like now I'm 45 so", "14:44", "now I don't now I don't I'm too old", "14:47", "yeah I thought just said that's for me I", "14:48", "think that's a way out right that's a", "14:51", "way to go hey

wild", "15:28", "man's got to keep it up but he was you", "15:30", "know like you're talking about when you", "15:32", "can see it right when you can what does", "15:34", "it look like when I see I mean you look", "15:36", "at it's interesting to see in sports", "15:38", "right now we have a lot of athletes", "15:39", "right now that are operating they're the", "15:41", "oldest that you know that they that", "15:43", "we've seen and I believe a lot of it has", "15:47", "to do with the fact that that you know", "15:49", "that they have some examples but they're", "15:52", "also not take

"64:18", "they out of necessity they were easy to", "64:20", "get to with boat you know that that has", "64:22", "a big factor to it there's always some", "64:24", "sort of you know strategic there's", "64:27", "something to a stretch you know being a", "64:29", "strategic part location as well but yeah", "64:32", "I don't know why Honolulu other than", "64:34", "great for mooring and

"well and so it's you know it's it's", "72:31", "really about rest and recovery and", "72:33", "breathing it's more based on on that", "72:36", "part it's not just another training", "72:37", "thing of like hey how we you know how we", "72:39", "can hammer you I mean I think that's", "72:42", "overplayed I think the ways we can train", "72:45", "and and how we're training is really", "72:47",

knowing how to move", "73:13", "correctly I think that's a big part of", "73:15", "it cuz plenty of people hurt themselves", "73:16", "especially in the gym meet without you", "73:18", "know without some knowledge of movement", "73:20", "in form mm-hmm", "73:22", "and then I have a pool training system I", "73:24", "developed which is the Gabi was telling", "73:26", "them yeah that sounds a crazy yeah", "73:27", "that's the most proprietary thing I", "73:29", "think we have is it's a marriage between", "73:32", "the gym and the in the pool because I", "73:34", "despise swimming that's you yeah well I", "73:38", "know I do I just watch if you said go do", "73:42", "laps in the pool", "73:43", "I'd be like Shamu and I get the floppy", "73:45", "fin and really oh yeah I just said I I", "73:47", "just that's crazy", "73:48", "you're fucking surf no but I'm saying", "73:50", "but but if you said hey we're gonna take", "73:52", "these masks in this fins and we're gonna", "73:54", "swim this coastline where the waves are", "73:56", "breaking on the rocks and we're gonna go", "73:58", "for five miles I'm in like I but if you", "74:02", "said hey go down there and and and and", "74:05", "wear some swim goggles where you can't", "74:07", "even see and swim in some murky water", "74:09", "where you don't know what's in it and", "74:10", "we're gonna swim a mile down there and", "74:12", "you're gonna do that every day that D", "74:13", "I'd rather step on a you know rusty nail", "74:15", "then do that I mean it's like that's so", "74:18", "because of my my disdain for swimming", "74:22", "that kind of swimming I mean if there's", "74:24", "its if it's in the surf and the waves", "74:26", "that's a different that's a different", "74:27", "game that's a whole different we don't", "74:29", "want to do laps in the pool you'd kill", "74:31", "me yeah I'm gonna die I just I would", "74:33", "rather yeah I just I'd rather get my", "74:35", "hand with it it's so weird", "74:39", "enjoy moving in the water but I do with", "74:42", "some dumbbells", "74:43", "okay so carrying a dumbbell and jumping", "74:47", "within dumbbells well why did you start", "74:49", "xpt like what was the motivation because", "74:52", "you're obviously into doing these stuff", "74:54", "yourself yeah why create a foundation or", "74:56", "well the reason why we started it was", "74:59", "because an opportunity to expose this", "75:01", "stuff and share with more people we were", "75:03", "doing in ourselves naturally and then we", "75:05", "have friends come and they were like", "75:06", "this stuff's awesome and then can I", "75:08", "invite my friend and then we were we", "75:10", "realized that that if we really wanted", "75:12", "to expose it to more people and share it", "75:14", "we were gonna", "75:15", "it was gonna be a limitation if", "75:16", "everybody had to come to my house to", "75:18", "have like a website and every young yeah", "75:20", "what is the XP t like XP t life comm and", "75:25", "XP T stands for well my my concept is is", "75:29", "it exploration and performance training", "75:31", "ah there's a high performance fuels a", "75:34", "limitless life dumbbells in the pool", "75:36", "there oh yeah so this is all you are you", "75:39", "you I need to yeah you should come well", "75:42", "I'm just in it kyle Kingsbury yeah i", "75:45", "love that guy", "75:46", "yeah the we'll have some beautiful guys", "75:49", "come like i'll give you a great thing", "75:51", "that you'd appreciate is i have this", "75:53", "hole well first of all there's a bunch", "75:55", "of things that happen in the water right", "75:57", "which one of the things that happens is", "75:59", "when you're underwater the compression", "76:01", "of the water allows the blood to flow", "76:03", "through your lymphatic system which", "76:04", "normally takes about a 24 hour period it", "76:07", "happens in one hour", "76:08", "so imagine compression tights like you", "76:10", "know if you wear compression it really", "76:11", "helps the blood flow right well this is", "76:14", "the ultimate compression the water is", "76:16", "right so then you deal with the", "76:17", "psychology so it's good for fighters", "76:19", "like III fighters because of the", "76:23", "psychology of what we can do because you", "76:25", "deal a lot with stress so we're able to", "76:28", "implement", "76:29", "stress in a very controlled environment", "76:31", "and then and then and then like for", "76:34", "example and grant hill at one point in", "76:36", "his career but i have love friend Joakim", "76:38", "Noah who's a basketball player and we", "76:40", "were doing these we're doing these in", "76:42", "the water we're doing these dunking", "76:44", "drills last summer so he trained with", "76:46", "him and get a bunch of stuff because you", "76:48", "can do a lot of highly explosive heavy", "76:50", "loaded movement with protection because", "76:54", "now you don't have to worry about", "76:55", "momentum which is what's gonna pull your", "76:57", "shoulder out it's gonna be hip that's", "76:58", "gonna hurt your knee where I can take a", "77:00", "basketball player and I can run him", "77:01", "through thousands of jumps thousands", "77:04", "which at the end of if I did that on", "77:06", "land he would be broken", "77:08", "he's already jumping too much in his", "77:09", "season he doesn't need to jump more", "77:11", "right so I could load him up and make", "77:13", "him do these dynamic movements but now", "77:16", "he's protected because he's because", "77:17", "we've taken gravity out so we're had so", "77:19", "it's it's like it's like saying hey we", "77:21", "get to go trade in outer space but it's", "77:23", "in my backyard right now what what kind", "77:25", "of results of these athletes well", "77:27", "experience well", "77:28", "Joakim in his career and I don't know", "77:30", "how many years he's been in the NBA he", "77:32", "came back after doing this dunking job", "77:34", "just using this as an example and uh and", "77:38", "had the most dunks per minute that he's", "77:40", "had in his entire career whoa he was", "77:42", "like Duncan on it was slamming on", "77:44", "everybody I mean it helps that he's", "77:45", "seven feet tall but the fact is is that", "77:47", "he he he noticed now you know Grant Hill", "77:52", "was talking about he gained three inches", "77:53", "in the last year of his career after", "77:55", "playing in the NBA for 20 years I've", "77:56", "said he's jumping 3 inches higher look", "77:58", "yeah yeah so I mean we're getting well", "78:00", "I'm that's the kind of tangible stuff", "78:01", "that I'm that I that I'm getting just", "78:03", "that there's a lot more things a lot of", "78:06", "it has to do with breath because in the", "78:09", "water it's all controlled breathing", "78:10", "patterns so everything is controlled", "78:12", "because you can't breathe in till you", "78:13", "get to the top so if you're doing a", "78:14", "drill where you're jumping and most of", "78:16", "the things we do are leg driven swimming", "78:19", "is mostly arms part of the reason why", "78:21", "people only use their arms is because", "78:22", "you use five times the oxygen with your", "78:25", "legs as you do with your arms so the", "78:27", "legs are very inefficient for swimming", "78:29", "but yet they create a lot of load on", "78:30", "your heart which that can boost your", "78:33", "breath holding and so there's a bunch of", "78:35", "other other things that happen but a lot", "78:38", "of it is just that environment is very", "78:40", "protective so for recovery too for like", "78:43", "what somebody's got a hurt knee hurt hip", "78:45", "hurt ankle you can go in there and start", "78:47", "moving dynamically early before you", "78:50", "would ever do it on land and be", "78:52", "protected so there's a bunch of you know", "78:54", "and then we could just Ratchet it up I", "78:56", "can make you know if I I truly believe", "78:59", "if you gave if you said you know I'll", "79:01", "get you Phelps is gonna come to your", "79:03", "house and you're gonna have Phelps for", "79:04", "three months I could make Phelps faster", "79:06", "yeah this is this is this I'm so I'm", "79:09", "he's doing a dunking drill and he's", "79:11", "using a medicine ball but he's having to", "79:12", "jump out of three feet of water right", "79:14", "mm-hmm so when he gets on land when he", "79:18", "gets on land it's like it's like a he", "79:20", "it's like a whole other game yeah it", "79:23", "imagine a whole nother game now did you", "79:26", "invent this protocol this whole thing of", "79:29", "jumping and doing in the water what what", "79:31", "motivated you well I came the original", "79:34", "concept came out of the drilled not a", "79:36", "drill a thing we used to do in the", "79:38", "summer when we were kids it's a Hawaiian", "79:41", "kind of Waterman drill where you run on", "79:43", "the bottom of stones docena BJ Penn does", "79:45", "that so you get a

and then he goes along", "79:54", "as far as he can and you swim and you", "79:56", "just go back and forth until neither one", "79:57", "of you can do it", "79:58", "so his base kind of on that concept and", "80:01", "then but I wanted to expand that because", "80:03", "that's kind of limiting you just swim", "80:05", "and you run and you can't isolate", "80:07", "movements and you're not working it like", "80:11", "you can with dumbbells so now I shift", "80:13", "dumbbells into the water and and I have", "80:15", "all different weights so depending on", "80:16", "your skill level you know everything we", "80:18", "do and that's one thing about everything", "80:21", "that I'm involved in is is it usually", "80:23", "has to have a spec to be able to be you", "80:27", "know for everybody to do it it has to be", "80:29", "old people and kids too in my mind that", "80:33", "it's not viable", "80:35", "unless it's it you can appeal to", "80:37", "everybody that you need you need to a", "80:39", "kids need to be able to do it an old", "80:41", "person to be able to really be valid", "80:43", "that really have legitimacy you know", "80:45", "it's like okay the coffee it has to be", "80:47", "there has to be things that the kids can", "80:49", "can have that creamer the old people can", "80:51", "have it it's gotta be can't just be", "80:53", "specialized I think the specialization", "80:55", "of some of this stuff is creates the", "80:58", "lack of validity I don't think that it's", "81:01", "valid if it's specialized and so I could", "81:03", "take a little kid like my daughter does", "81:05", "a bunch of the pool training stuff right", "81:07", "I have an older older guys that come and", "81:09", "do a bunch of the pool training stuff", "81:10", "you know I got Pat Riley comes in there", "81:11", "and he trains in the summer time with us", "81:13", "and stuff yeah yeah so we get a really", "81:16", "broad spectrum of people and that and", "81:18", "that confirms to me that it's really", "81:21", "legitimate right because then it's like", "81:23", "now this is real like the kids can do it", "81:25", "the whole people can do it the top guys", "81:27",

what what is real so", "81:38", "how many years even doing this xpt well", "81:41", "I mean the pull training I've been I", "81:43", "developed over the last probably ten to", "81:46", "twelve years about twelve years now in", "81:47", "the pool with any you've evolved it so", "81:49", "you talked off with a couple ideas why", "81:51", "before I had like a Velcro weight jacket", "81:54",

"82:04", "that was so then we moved of dumbbells", "82:07", "where you can drop them and but we you", "82:09", "know there's probably 20 exercises that", "82:11", "we asked way to use and it depends", "82:13", "sometimes we're doing we have a move", "82:14", "called the gorilla where we're using you", "82:16", "know sixty to seventy seventy pound", "82:18", "dumbbells where you're doing a curl",

all", "82:37", "depends on the person's skill what the", "82:39", "drill is but we I have a whole I have", "82:41", "all the weights next to the pool so we", "82:43", "have everything from seventies to to", "82:45", "five pound dumbbells I love that idea of", "82:48", "the jump press like doing some sort of a", "82:51", "oh yeah it's all you'd love it it's", "82:54", "crazy I call it the gorilla curl so it's", "82:57", "a squat curl press jump and then when", "83:00", "you come out of the water you just let", "83:02", "the weights drop and then the water", "83:03", "catches it you could never do that and", "83:05", "how do you rip your shoulder out right", "83:07", "right how do you do this in the water", "83:08", "well you vary on your height mm-hmm so I", "83:10", "have I have a about a 11 foot deep end", "83:14", "and then I have a slope so you can", "83:16", "choose every depth all the way and then", "83:17", "I have what you saw in that last video", "83:20", "it's about a three and a half foot", "83:21", "shallow end hmm so this is the first", "83:23", "pool I'm trying to build a couple I'm", "83:25", "trying to build one in Hawaii right now", "83:26", "that's that's gonna evolve from what I", "83:29", "learned from this pool so this pool I", "83:31", "just kind of built it with you know with", "83:34", "the hopes of designing a program and", "83:36", "then out of it came all the all this", "83:39", "stuff what are you gonna alter I'm gonna", "83:41", "create multiple depths so I'm gonna do", "83:44", "like an area that has 12 foot then we're", "83:47", "gonna shift back 2 feet and have a 10", "83:49", "foot and then another flat area of 8", "83:51", "foot and then another flat area 6 foot", "83:53", "mm-hmm and then I have the magic width", "83:55", "is about somewhere between 35 to 40 feet", "83:59", "wide and that's like if you're trying to", "84:00", "swim a heavy dumbbell you know we do a", "84:02", "lot of individual limbs stuff so that",

you have a real nice set of", "89:01", "six-pack abs your you don't you're not", "89:04", "able to diaphragmatic ly breathe you're", "89:05", "not able to use your diaphragm you're", "89:07", "not using your diaphragm", "89:08", "without that yeah because you're you", "89:10", "hear the tightness isn't allowing the", "89:12", "diaphragm to push down the diaphragm and", "89:14", "the pel and the

the guys are gonna hear this and go", "89:44", "good I'm gonna stay fat I don't need a", "89:45", "six-pack well but but no but but I", "89:50", "actually if you're really using your", "89:52", "lungs you you can you know strengthen", "89:54", "your core in a way that you'll get core", "89:57", "you could have six-pack abs and not have", "89:59", "core stability like so you know I mean", "90:01",

you've", "90:37", "ever seen you're like that that guy is", "90:38", "the most ripped and shredded a lot of", "90:39", "times those guys get knocked out you", "90:42", "know you see", "90:43", "you just call this guy's gonna kill this", "90:45", "guy and then he just gets you know", "90:47", "annihilated by the guy that looks maybe", "90:49", "not quite sure that's hard right right", "90:51",

swimmer yeah yeah WA", "91:01", "and you you might find that his", "91:03", "breathing he might he might have better", "91:06", "air volume because at the end of the day", "91:07", "a lot of its about oxygen cardio yeah", "91:10", "and Max's cardio is off the charts", "91:12", "exactly so he's getting more movement", "91:14", "out of there I mean you know again we've", "91:16", "created these you know aesthetic things", "91:18", "in our culture like Oh six-pack abs a", "91:21", "sign of this and done it up but when you", "91:23", "look at real breath work and how the", "91:26", "diaphragm works and how the ribs expand", "91:28", "you realize is like we're none of us are", "91:31", "really doing it right you know and you", "91:33", "can actually create more volume you know", "91:35", "you said you like cordyceps mushrooms", "91:37", "yes well those are actually a", "91:38", "vasodilator those helps help you absorb", "91:40", "oxygen you those can up your vo2 max", "91:43", "right there's only a couple things that", "91:44", "you can how to increase your vo2 max but", "91:46", "cordyceps is one of them pieces beats is", "91:48", "another one you can create more volume", "91:50", "by expanding your lungs so by opening", "91:53", "the ribcage in creating more room that", "91:55", "can create um promote your vo2 max now", "91:58", "when people are hearing this and they're", "91:59", "hearing breath work folks who have never", "92:01", "done anything like that they don't they", "92:03", "really don't understand what you're", "92:04", "saying like what do you mean by breath", "92:05", "work like give us an example of like a", "92:07", "protocol well I mean a real simple I", "92:09", "mean they do it in pranayama they have", "92:11", "it in apnea there's a thing called", "92:13", "holotropic breathwork really is is when", "92:16", "you isolate the breathing system and you", "92:19", "know the simplest way and that's why wim", "92:21", "says hey I don't give a shit how you", "92:23", "breathe just breathe that's right yeah", "92:25", "yeah so you know like will do a breath", "92:29", "routine and we'll sit somebody down and", "92:30", "we'll say okay breathe like you're", "92:31", "running breathe like you're running and", "92:34", "we'll tell the guy breathe like he's", "92:35", "running another", "92:37", "i go thats a slowrun buddy like breathe", "92:40", "like you're running like you know like", "92:43", "like anytime you need any movement in", "92:46", "any air in and out is gonna is a form of", "92:49", "breath work right and especially when", "92:50", "you isolate the system and you're not", "92:52", "doing it because of an activity the the", "92:54", "fact is that when you use that system", "92:56", "and you work it and you're not", "92:59", "detracting from it by doing an exercise", "93:01", "if you're doing the assault bike where", "93:03", "your arms are working and your legs are", "93:05", "working so all the

system and that system", "93:15", "is gonna develop and get better then", "93:18", "when you do your assault bike after you", "93:20", "develop that system so will isolate", "93:22", "breath work and we'll just do it alone", "93:24", "well whether we're doing you know", "93:26", "whether we're doing breath holes we're", "93:27", "doing some kind of apnea breath work", "93:29", "which is you know we can do a pattern", "93:32", "where you're doing like you you hold for", "93:34", "30 seconds and then you breathe in for", "93:37", "15 and then you breathe out for 15 then", "93:40", "you hold again", "93:41", "then you go in and out and hold in and", "93:43", "out and hold that's one pattern another", "93:45", "pattern is in hold out hold in hold out", "93:49", "hold in hold out like you know again", "93:52", "those are theirs you know and then", "93:54", "there's pranayama apnea holotropic", "93:57", "there's just some where you're", "93:58", "oxygenating the system where you know",
