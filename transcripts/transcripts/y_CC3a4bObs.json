about it", "42:29", "we don't know enough information", "42:31", "generally but we don't know we don't", "42:33", "have information we can trust we have", "42:35", "all this spin and ads and all the

for", "43:01", "many years and basically what he's shown", "43:04", "is that the best way to predict what a", "43:08", "politician will do if they're elected is", "43:10", "to look at where they get their money", "43:12", "and to look at also who they give money", "43:14", "to because most politicians also kind of", "43:16", "donate to other candidates so if you", "43:18", "look at all that

stuff and doing loads of", "43:37", "research you can get a quick snapshot of", "43:39", "who these people are and then in time", "43:42", "the other thing we want to do is make it", "43:43",

"44:01", "into politics it's a really small number", "44:03", "compared to the number of people who", "44:05", "vote and then the number of adults in", "44:07", "the whole country", "44:07", "it's a tiny number that are funding it", "44:10", "all and even within that most of the", "44:11", "money comes from an even smaller number", "44:13", "and they're paying for all of this and", "44:15", "they're getting the outcomes that they", "44:18", "pay for it's basically a transaction", "44:20", "that's what's really crazy and so some", "44:24", "people say", "44:25", "right you got to get money out of", "44:26", "politics that's you just got to get it", "44:28", "out and obviously that is something that", "44:31", "has a lot of appeal you can see why", "44:33", "you'd want to do that there's a", "44:34", "brilliant guy called Larry Lessig I", "44:36", "don't know if you come across what he's", "44:37", "been doing and he's been arguing about", "44:39", "this for years and he's been saying he's", "44:41", "a hobbit Harvard is a brilliant", "44:44", "campaigner on this issue of money in", "44:45", "politics and he's been saying if you", "44:49", "think about any problem in in

anywhere about", "45:00", "in terms of solving that problem unless", "45:02", "you deal with the first problem which is", "45:03", "the money because the money in politics", "45:05", "stops the proper

out and he's got a campaign", "45:21", "around that and and he wants public", "45:23", "funding for elections and so on and all", "45:26", "that is kind of a noble aim I guess but", "45:30", "my feeling is that that's a really hard", "45:33", "sell because you've got a constitution", "45:35", "that says it's free speech you're", "45:37", "allowed to give money to to politicians", "45:39", "and we can't just kind of stop that", "45:41", "you've got to let people donate to", "45:43", "politicians and so our take on it is to", "45:46", "say well if you can't take the money out", "45:48",

"46:06", "it easier for people to get involved in", "46:08", "politics so that they can really you", "46:10", "know get these politicians off this hook", "46:12", "theorem which is that their

"62:14", "what I was talking about was that", "62:14", "traffic they were having lights like if", "62:18", "you were going through the light as it", "62:19", "was yellow and it turned red they would",

you", "62:29", "a ticket and but it would turn out to be", "62:31", "a private company that was actually", "62:32", "profiting from these tickets and so they", "62:34", "deemed that unconstitutional

like freedom and one of the", "63:12", "reasons why people like freedom is", "63:14", "because freedom isn't just the freedom", "63:16", "to do as you wish it's the freedom to", "63:19", "not have to

"63:38", "lives it's like we've complicated", "63:41", "ourselves to this point of almost of no", "63:44", "return and where there's a very few very", "63:48", "few alternatives yeah I think that the", "63:52", "thing that happens then is that they've", "63:54", "complicated it then it's not working and", "63:57", "they say oh we could better try and fix", "63:58", "it and then the the fixing of it makes", "64:00", "it even more complicated and it's just", "64:02", "getting there and then a new government", "64:03", "comes in or a new governor or whoever it", "64:05", "may be and and instead of actually just", "64:07", "stopping and thinking you know what this", "64:08", "hot we just got to rethink the whole", "64:09", "thing and start from scratch and and", "64:13", "just not tinker with it anymore and try", "64:15", "and improve it because it's just gonna", "64:17", "make it more complicated that never", "64:19", "happens there's never really enough time", "64:21", "for that to happen they're not there", "64:22", "they're only thinking about the next", "64:23", "couple of years in the next election or", "64:25", "whatever", "64:25", "and so things just get even more", "64:28", "complicated never they never seem to get", "64:31", "to that point weapon yeah that's really", "64:33", "working great now my wife and I went out", "64:35", "to this restaurant the other night and", "64:36", "the the restaurant was this we were", "64:39", "noticing that there's this theme that's", "64:40", "going on and a lot of restaurants where", "64:42", "they have like this rustic thing going", "64:45", "on where they have old-school lights the", "64:47", "filaments in them and then they have", "64:49", "hardwood tables and wrought iron this", "64:52", "and metal that and and I was like I", "64:54", "think people are sort of reacting to", "64:57", "this fabricated world that we've created", "64:59", "and we long for this simplicity that's", "65:02", "why there's these shows like these", "65:05", "Alaska shows where people living on the", "65:07", "frontier and they're fucking collecting", "65:10", "wood and fighting off wolves it's like", "65:12", "we almost long for that simplicity above", "65:15", "this world that we've complicated to", "65:18", "this almost unmanageable point yeah it's", "65:21", "definitely true and you see in in so", "65:23", "many eras that I mean it's like food is", "65:25", "a great example well there's kind of", "65:27", "stuff about organic food and seasonal", "65:30", "and local and grow it in your garden and", "65:32", "that whole movement I think is in", "65:33", "reaction I mean if you think about food", "65:35", "like years ago like in the 50s I think", "65:37", "you know it was all about you know let's", "65:41", "have you know the all the kind of TV", "65:42", "dinners packaged food and all this kind", "65:44", "of industrialized food that was then", "65:46", "seen as better because it was you know", "65:49", "scientific and hygienic and like really", "65:51", "kind of good for you and then people are", "65:53", "now just thinking that is just really", "65:55", "horrible this is all the chemicals it's", "65:56", "disgusting now the movement is all for", "65:58", "this kind of local organic food it made", "66:01", "me laughter because my family from", "66:04", "Hungary and so when I was a kid we used", "66:07", "to go back to Hungary the whole time it", "66:08", "was a communist country and there were", "66:10", "no you know food stores loads of choice", "66:13", "and everything and you would go in the", "66:14", "store and it was just you know what you", "66:16", "got just a few sort of vegetables and it", "66:18", "was it was just very basic and now", "66:21", "remember the other day walking around in", "66:24", "San Francisco and there's the kind of", "66:25", "farmers market thing going on and they", "66:27", "had that kind of you know ugly", "66:28", "vegetables and whatever put out there", "66:29", "and he just looked exactly like hungry", "66:32", "the Hungarian communist food shop but", "66:34", "here in San Francisco it's the most", "66:36", "expensive fancy

"66:45", "before and we're currently I think", "66:46", "you're totally right in this kind of", "66:47", "sense of he's just gone too far the", "66:49", "whole industrialization of so many", "66:52",

think", "143:31", "that that's the the job of I think", "143:34", "there's all sorts of roles that are", "143:36", "played in a society and there's the the", "143:39", "innovator and there's the
