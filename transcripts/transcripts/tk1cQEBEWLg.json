contamination but I", "95:30", "didn't take all the steps that I had", "95:32", "this time and once that whole process", "95:35", "was such a motherfuck", "95:36", "like this is never gonna happen again so", "95:39", "every supplement lot that I took I would", "95:41", "always keep bits of it behind for until", "95:44", "I need I could get I felt there was", "95:45", "enough time it expired and get rid of it", "95:47", "because no one's gonna come back and", "95:48", "test me I passed all my tests so so once", "95:52", "you passed your test you would get rid", "95:53", "of the old right I

now but I know", "96:03", "that with this brand of tribulus I'd", "96:06", "taken I'd take in three or four", "96:09", "different other supplements in the same", "96:10", "company and all past no problem on their", "96:12", "times right so it was just some weird", "96:14", "contamination which does happen again", "96:16", "happening to me yes it's happened to", "96:19", "several far as I can tell I mean I'm not", "96:21", "testing their whole product line but it", "96:23", "just seemed like a fluke and it's just", "96:24", "such a simple supplement in any case a", "96:27", "one ingredient deal so then they come", "96:30", "back they're like all you tested", "96:31", "positive for this I'm like well that", "96:33", "ain't fuckin possible so then I send in", "96:35", "some supplements which I had to pay for", "96:37", "to have them tested they run them", "96:39", "through the testing and then bang they", "96:40", "find it all right there you go there's", "96:43", "your deal then they went out and bought", "96:45", "a brand new bottle", "96:47", "unopened same lot tested that one verify", "96:50", "the results same thing test same thing", "96:53", "doesn't happen that Tim means as well so", "96:55", "then he were in contact with you sada", "96:57", "throughout the entirety of this so we", "96:59", "don't ever break contact with you sada", "97:02", "we have a specific guy I'm not gonna", "97:04", "throw his name out there anything but we", "97:06", "have a guy that we spoke to directly the", "97:08", "whole time through my manager was", "97:11", "speaking with him and I've seen the", "97:12", "emails and so we're talking about how we", "97:16", "know this is a contamination and when", "97:18", "the in you know when we get done with", "97:20", "all this why don't we even try to put", "97:23", "together something some some promotional", "97:25", "stuff anything that we can do to try and", "97:27", "keep athletes from ending up in the same", "97:29", "issues and we'd like to do whatever we", "97:30", "could to help you guys out with this you", "97:32", "know we're not against you or we don't", "97:35", "mind being a part of the system", "97:36", "and we understand why you're here and", "97:39", "I'm not against them wanting to do drug", "97:41", "testing or whatever and try to keep a a", "97:43", "clean and fair playing field I get the", "97:47", "point of it so we get the these", "97:50", "supplements tested they test the", "97:52", "secondary batch they have all their", "97:54", "information it's like alright this", "97:55", "should be she fucking rock and roll and", "97:58", "then they got real quiet okay now you're", "98:03", "not talking to us anymore", "98:04", "what do you mean like you would contact", "98:06", "them they wouldn't respond they would", "98:08", "take him a week two weeks and what were", "98:10", "they saying when they do respond uh you", "98:12", "know I I can't entirely remember myself", "98:14", "my manager was in touch with them so", "98:16", "what is the protocol if someone tests", "98:18", "positive for something that's a tainted", "98:19", "supplement and it's a third-party", "98:21", "supplement and where it's not it was not", "98:24", "third-party verified rather well I don't", "98:26", "even know if it was third-party verified", "98:28", "that anything would be any different mmm", "98:30", "okay well if it is third-party verified", "98:33", "and still is tainted yeah that would be", "98:35", "an issue right yeah if you tested", "98:37", "positive you tested positive if they", "98:39", "found the supplement yeah I think the", "98:40", "idea about third-party verified is it's", "98:42", "much less likely to be a toy", "98:46", "it doesn't solve anything right and this", "98:48", "is coming from someone who's in the", "98:49", "supplement business you know you're a", "98:51", "certain amount of this stuff you farm", "98:52", "out so far as I know what the deal is", "98:56", "there is a period of ineligibility sort", "98:59", "of basically what what happens is you're", "99:01", "effectively suspended until this thing", "99:03", "is all finished out and they try to say", "99:06", "that you're not suspended there's no", "99:07", "suspension but that's not true", "99:10", "well no one treats you as you're", "99:12", "suspended I tried to corner Travis Brown", "99:14", "because I was training him and they", "99:16", "wouldn't let me it wouldn't let you the", "99:18", "Horner mission would let me throw up", "99:19", "yes okay a lot and they're like you're", "99:22", "suspended so you can't you can't corner", "99:25", "but you said you're not suspended she", "99:26", "huh exactly okay so you're effectively", "99:29", "suspended you can't work you can't even", "99:32", "work as a a tertiary individual as a", "99:36", "cornerman or anything like that it can't", "99:37", "be at the event and this is after the", "99:40", "fact where you brought them the", "99:42", "supplements they independently verify", "99:44", "that it was tainted yes and so then we", "99:49", "start talking in the", "99:50", "throughout the process I said look I'm", "99:52", "not taking a punishment for", "99:54", "contamination and I'm not even fighting", "99:57", "I'm not fighting anytime soon", "99:59", "I'm not you you can't like what you did", "100:01", "with means and these other people you", "100:03", "punished them you know that it was", "100:05", "contamination but you punished them yeah", "100:08", "they gave them many months yes of you", "100:10", "know suspension so that they weren't", "100:12", "able to compete or make a living during", "100:14", "those marks right and I'm like no I'm", "100:15", "not dealing I'm not taking that that's", "100:16", "not acceptable", "100:17", "because I'm not that's not what's going", "100:20", "on here and nobody is doping nobody's", "100:22", "trying to cheat the system right there", "100:24", "is no I'm not even fighting you you", "100:27", "don't get by punishing me you're trying", "100:29", "to levy guilt on me you're trying to", "100:31", "make me out to be some sort of you know", "100:35", "guilty party as if I'm trying to be a", "100:39", "cheat of some soreness like I'm not", "100:41", "dealing I'm not taking so how did it", "100:42", "ultimately get resolved well ultimately", "100:44", "what ended up happening is we had to go", "100:47", "to arbitration that was all it was", "100:49", "really left to us because then they", "100:50", "started trying to bring up stuff from my", "100:54", "past and then weigh that against me as", "100:56", "well and it's like whoa dude you guys", "100:57", "weren't even around and now you get to", "100:59", "decide to add to the to weight of", "101:02", "whatever punishment you want to levy", "101:04", "against me based on things that didn't", "101:07", "involve you great so what were they", "101:10", "talking about they're talking about 2001", "101:12", "no 2008 they went to 2008 yeah the", "101:16", "election they tried to say well oh yeah", "101:18", "well this happened so then therefore you", "101:20", "know now they start talking about two", "101:22", "years mm-hmm like you gotta be fucking", "101:24", "kidding me", "101:25", "they start talking about suspending you", "101:26", "for two years tainted supplements yes", "101:28", "Wow and I'm just going there's no way I", "101:31", "wouldn't even expect six months you", "101:32", "think I'm gonna take two years and so we", "101:34", "go and we inquire on the Arbour and I've", "101:36", "done I did an interview with the guy", "101:38", "that we were dealing with through Skype", "101:40", "we've we've been in touch it just like", "101:42", "at some point everything turned and", "101:44", "changed their tone changed their even", "101:47", "the original penalties they were looking", "101:49", "to levy increased new shit gets brought", "101:52", "in it's it's like they became a", "101:54", "completely different animal as soon as", "101:56", "you know there was the evidence of", "102:00", "contamination and that I wasn't gonna I", "102:03", "wasn't willing to take", "102:05", "punishment for it I wasn't what do you", "102:07", "think their motivation is here I think", "102:09", "that they and this is just my opinion I", "102:11", "think the way you sada looks at it and", "102:13", "it's an easy way to go about it is that", "102:15", "the more people they ding the more", "102:17", "effective they appear it's their effect", "102:19", "their efficacy is based on Punnett on", "102:21", "punishments doled out not necessarily", "102:25", "think this is you know also remember", "102:28", "Jason by the people that are working", "102:30", "there so they arbitrarily get to decide", "102:32", "how things go about right there's not", "102:34", "like a very strict protocol that they", "102:37", "might follow they're tainted supplements", "102:39", "and for this no there is actually quite", "102:41", "a bit of leverage or there's there is", "102:44", "leeway in terms of how they can enforce", "102:46", "and what they can enforce so when so", "102:47", "it's subjective it's a very subjectivity", "102:49", "in it they they have a lot of discretion", "102:53", "there is some outlined elements of", "102:56",

"103:05", "through the process of finding out", "103:07", "whether this is contamination or what", "103:09", "have you doing any testing and that", "103:11", "makes sense to me that's fine I",
