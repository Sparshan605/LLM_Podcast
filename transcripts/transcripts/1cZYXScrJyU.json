never", "96:18", "seen this before now what are your", "96:19", "thoughts on it I'm like to use I mean", "96:21", "it's such a that choice of words is such", "96:24", "a way to just if I'm if I'm person", "96:27", "reading that I'm like my immediate my", "96:30", "goes you said what you can't like it's", "96:32", "such an offensive word where you're", "96:33", "gonna even go there it immediately", "96:35", "distracts from the point that you're", "96:37", "trying to make so that's a good way of", "96:39", "putting you know it's it's such like a", "96:41", "you just need you need like I don't", "96:43", "think that guy I don't know if he's", "96:44", "racist or not but like I don't think he", "96:46", "is but your immediate reaction is like", "96:48", "this guy you can't do that that's right", "96:50", "you have you have fundamentally", "96:53", "destroyed whatever point you were trying", "96:55", "to make because of your choice it's like", "96:58", "you could be trying to save I can't", "97:01", "think of the analogy now but like it's", "97:03", "it's such a distracting choice of words", "97:06", "yeah that's a great way of putting it", "97:07", "you know yeah it's like he could have", "97:09", "said and by the way like all", "97:11", "conversations including this one", "97:13", "like I'm trying to formulate these", "97:14", "opinions on the fly so are you yeah that", "97:17", "was what he was doing on the fly I don't", "97:19", "think there's anything he prepared so I", "97:21", "think you mean that wasn't vetted he's", "97:28", "gone over that with a fucking", "97:29", "highlighter that is the key points and", "97:31", "once I hit there's have been a few", "97:32", "websites I was trying to look up the", "97:34", "ones exactly but I know for
