on", "26:14", "Instagram too and they know that this", "26:17", "causes depression and they're still", "26:19", "doing it because they know that the you", "26:22", "know they're they think they're better", "26:24", "at showing you what you want to see than", "26:26", "you are and they want to make money from", "26:28", "it what do you mean by they know that", "26:30", "this causes depression",

users", "26:43", "where they were injecting both positive", "26:45", "and negative content into the newsfeed", "26:48", "and they proved that they could affect", "26:49", "people's moods this was with

if they're trying", "27:42", "to make it better do you think that", "27:45", "they're really that's a factor that it", "27:48", "actually could I mean how does it cause", "27:50", "depression if they're just if your", "27:52", "images or your posts are not being seen", "27:54", "as by as many people have you talked to", "27:58", "kids posting on social media and their", "28:02", "reactions to how many likes they're", "28:03", "getting they get very very concerned", "28:10", "well that seems like more of a problem", "28:13", "with that", "28:13", "it is both it's not it is on both sides", "28:17", "being addicted to likes as some sort of", "28:20", "a you know it's a weird doping yeah", "28:22", "right it's not healthy and no we need to", "28:25", "learn to not care about that but I think", "28:28", "that the core purpose of a social", "28:30", "network is to subscribe to someone and", "28:32", "see their stuff yeah and when people", "28:34", "subscribe to you they see your stuff", "28:36", "right so when you spend years building", "28:38", "up a following on social media and say", "28:42", "you burn a hundred thousand powers or", "28:43", "something and then suddenly the network", "28:46", "says mmm nah no your friends can't see", "28:50", "that anymore", "28:51", "that's not cool and and even to like", "28:54", "Twitter's default newsfeed is no longer", "28:56", "chronological you have to click it to go", "28:59", "chronological and then it defaults back", "29:01", "to their weird algorithm thing so we're", "29:04", "saying look 100% organic chronological", "29:06", "raw forever as default and then if you", "29:08", "want to curate you know algorithms or", "29:11", "have recommended stuff come in as an", "29:12", "alternative fine but that is the core", "29:15", "purpose of social media is to connect", "29:18", "with people that follow you and the", "29:20", "other way what do you think the purpose", "29:21", "is like why do you think Facebook would", "29:23", "decide to have things not in", "29:26", "chronological order and only be seen by", "29:28", "5% of your followers like what would be", "29:30", "the benefit in that for them

stuff seen", "29:44", "by less people it doesn't make sense", "29:45", "that's a good point", "29:47", "it sort of works both ways I think that", "29:50", "they think they know the people that", "29:52", "you're gonna react to the most so as a", "29:56", "consumer when you're getting that", "29:58", "content you know the algorithms are", "30:02", "showing you what you typically like have", "30:03", "you noticed that I'm really not paying", "30:05", "much attention but I believe you so yeah", "30:09", "for creator it's hurting creators people", "30:12", "who post are getting hurt people who are", "30:15", "sitting there just scrolling they're the", "30:17", "ones who are really getting you know", "30:20", "addicted more so with the algorithms so", "30:24", "how are the people that are posting", "30:25", "getting hurt they're gonna hurt because", "30:26", "their stuff is being seen by less people", "30:27", "yeah because it's not chronological and", "30:30", "it's not organic because it's curated", "30:32", "huh", "30:33", "but aren't they doing it because they", "30:35", "think it's gonna be a better and an", "30:37", "experience it's more conducive to your", "30:39", "life that's what they say what do you", "30:40", "think they're doing it for then they're", "30:41", "doing it because they have studied", "30:45", "through looking at the data how to keep", "30:47", "people on the app more right and that", "30:49", "way is to give them I say if I Google or", "30:52", "if I look at muscle cars on Instagram", "30:54", "now if I go to my search it's all muscle", "30:56", "car stuff so that's what it is they say", "30:58", "oh he likes that so we're gonna we're", "31:00", "just gonna give him a lot of that and I", "31:02", "think that's okay as an alternate", "31:04", "of feed or to put that somewhere I just", "31:07", "think the core feed always needs to stay", "31:09", "pure hmm because otherwise you're just", "31:13", "down the slippery slope again and", "31:15", "understand it's just feeding there", "31:16", "they're injecting things into your head", "31:18", "that you didn't ask for right and", "31:20", "they're doing it because they want to", "31:21", "keep you around yeah that makes sense", "31:24", "um how many different companies are", "31:27", "subscribing to that is it seems like all", "31:30", "the big ones we're saying are curating", "31:33", "and moving things around and all the big", "31:35", "ones have an algorithm that's designed", "31:37", "to keep you onboard right mm-hmm", "31:39", "and that's okay to pursue I think", "31:41", "there's really cool things you can do", "31:42", "with AI and machine learning and", "31:44", "algorithms that is really beneficial but", "31:47", "it's just taking away people's reach", "31:50", "when they have worked years and years to", "31:52", "achieve it it's not okay do you think", "31:54", "that this is this marriage between", "31:56", "something that is this social media", "31:59", "network that's designed to allow people", "32:01", "to communicate with each other and then", "32:03", "commerce like this business like how do", "32:05", "we maximize this business how do we get", "32:07", "more profit out of this business how do", "32:09", "we get these people to engage more and", "32:11", "then they start monkeying with the code", "32:13", "and screwing with what you see and what", "32:15", "you don't say you think that's what's", "32:16", "happening yeah but in the short term", "32:19", "it's probably working but in the long", "32:21", "term they're

and fine give me messages to opt", "32:33", "in so that you can show me certain", "32:35", "things but this whole force forcing", "32:39", "people into surveillances it just has to", "32:42", "stop it's it's super scary house it's", "32:46", "super scary to you it's just too much", "32:49", "power hmm yeah it's too much power for", "32:52", "something that supposed to be silly", "32:54", "right like what was Facebook supposed to", "32:55", "be supposed to be some silly thing that", "32:57", "you just can communicate with friends it", "32:59", "was but from the beginning all of these", "33:02", "none of these networks have ever really", "33:04", "been about the people of the networks", "33:06", "it's always been closed source since the", "33:09", "inception so but then you look at

"there and so we're stuck but again I", "64:02", "think that supplementing just installing", "64:06", "these alternative apps not just us it's", "64:08", "like the whole open", "64:09", "market I'm not even here trying to just", "64:12", "talk about what we're doing right it's", "64:15", "like if you don't have those apps on", "64:17", "your phone and you don't use those", "64:18", "browsers I'm sorry you just you're not", "64:22", "helping and people just want to vote", "64:24", "with their energy I think and vote with", "64:26", "their time so it's more of an education", "64:29", "thing people just don't know that this", "64:31", "matters and that this can help change", "64:33", "the whole internet simply by logging", "64:35", "into an app once in a while it's like", "64:38", "it's like organic food I mean we want to", "64:42", "put things into it we want to support", "64:44", "things that have integrity so when you", "64:47", "click something you are supporting that", "64:49",

"64:59", "that's where it's all based is in user", "65:01", "retention and energy and do you think", "65:05", "that most people are even aware of this", "65:06", "or you think they're just using it", "65:07", "because it's convenient the biggest", "65:10", "sharad going on right now most people", "65:12", "don't know that Facebook owns Instagram", "65:13", "they think instagrams like cool because", "65:16", "you know it's not Facebook right it's", "65:20", "one giant umbrella yeah yeah what is", "65:24", "what is the difference between the two", "65:26", "obviously with Instagram it's just", "65:28", "pictures mostly and then whatever the", "65:30", "post is blow the pictures but with", "65:32", "Facebook it's a lot more commentary and", "65:34", "long verbose statements on shit and then", "65:39", "people arguing in the comments about it", "65:41", "mm-hmm yeah they're all the the", "65:44", "Instagram founders left abandoned ship", "65:47", "the whatsapp founders abandon ship", "65:49", "the oculus of found her abandoned ship", "65:51", "all because of the privacy stuff real", "65:53", "they're like you took this good thing", "65:55", "well it was proprietary so I

companies left", "66:05", "because they hate what's going on what", "66:08", "the the whatsapp guy joined signal which", "66:10", "is a really cool open-source anti an", "66:13", "encrypted messaging app mm-hmm", "66:15", "so you know these people know so what", "66:18", "happened with whatsapp it's not the same", "66:20", "anymore whatsapp is owned by Facebook", "66:23", "I don't know this oh yeah yeah sorry", "66:26", "yeah come on bro get the jungle man's", "66:28", "like well you're deep into this man", "66:31", "that's why I want to talk to you yeah", "66:32", "it's and they're all buying up companies", "66:35", "and using these same sort of ideas yeah", "66:39", "now they're talking about integrating", "66:41", "the messages between whatsapp Instagram", "66:43", "and Facebook so it's all one system rule", "66:46", "yeah yeah", "66:47", "centralization it has happened hasn't", "66:53", "been turned on yet but I believe it's", "66:55", "happening like your DMS on Instagram",

like", "67:05", "there was a social media Instagram type", "67:09", "thing that was around a little while ago", "67:12", "remember I used it like once and I", "67:13", "posted about it and what was that called", "67:16", "but then Severo said what it was but", "67:19", "then a lot of people were saying is", "67:20", "bullshit and their proprietary well you", "67:24", "don't know it's closed source no idea", "67:26", "what's going on behind the scenes same", "67:28", "as the other one a lot of apps try to", "67:30", "say that their alternatives and that you", "67:33", "know they support X whines you know", "67:35", "privacy or free speech or whatnot but I", "67:38", "don't think it's any new paradigm if", "67:40", "they're not showing their source code so", "67:43", "that people can see the algorithms the", "67:44", "people who care you know obviously most", "67:46", "people aren't gonna go and inspect the", "67:47", "code right but just the principle that", "67:50", "the experts could because they will you", "67:53", "know there's all kinds of think tanks", "67:54", "and whatnot that would love to dive into", "67:56", "the source code to understand how these", "67:59", "companies were actually behaving so you", "68:01", "know waiving the privacy flag without", "68:04", "being open source or this is getting a", "68:07", "little bit into the weeds but a lot of", "68:08", "this comes down to licensing of content", "68:12", "or code so the license that we use for", "68:16", "our code is called the general public", "68:19", "license the a GPL v3 which means that", "68:22", "anyone can take our code and do whatever", "68:23", "they want with it they can sell it they", "68:25", "can do anything but if they make changes", "68:27", "they have to show them

"68:47", "it make it your own you know keep your", "68:50", "own little secret sauce if it makes you", "68:51", "feel good they get conflated because you", "68:55", "know free software sounds like free is", "68:58", "in free beer not free as in freedom so", "69:03", "you know licensing is really what this", "69:09", "all colas is into and and and but it's", "69:13", "been proven that you can make a lot of", "69:15", "money with free and open-source software", "69:17", "I mean look at WordPress it's a hugely", "69:20", "successful technology corporation the", "69:23", "multi-billion dollars people share the", "69:26", "code that's how it created a network", "69:29", "effect because they did that it's like", "69:30", "the Grateful Dead would let everybody", "69:32", "record their music and that was how it", "69:34", "spread so it's actually a good marketing", "69:37", "tactic and it also gives transparency so", "69:40", "people can see what the hell's going on", "69:41",

just thinking this is something that", "69:55", "I would like to do and do correctly", "69:57", "because I don't think anybody's doing it", "69:58", "this way open source", "69:59", "you know Pro

that's not a big misconception", "70:22", "we're trying to make give people the", "70:25", "tools to make money I mean we have like", "70:28", "a monthly recurring subscription system", "70:30", "sort

to be subject to overlords", "71:20", "right in our company decisions course so", "71:23", "you know you think that that's what", "71:25", "happened with Carl that is most likely", "71:28", "what happened so they stepped in and", "71:30", "said hey we don't want this guy to be a", "71:32", "part of the site yeah and I think that", "71:33", "striped probably stepped in with a lot", "71:35", "of

happens if you tell a person they", "99:08", "can't go anywhere then things get really", "99:10", "weird we're looking at more of a", "99:12", "community moderation structure so that", "99:16", "we've

as opposed to us or you know", "99:29", "but then when you go further than up for", "99:31", "the far enough into the decentralization", "99:33", "world it just becomes impossible so we", "99:35", "sort of have to decide I I think that's", "99:38", "where it's gonna go mm-hmm so I don't", "99:42", "know III that's that's the uncensor Abal", "99:47", "internet and this idea that we can do",

difficult", "100:00", "because deleting things from any", "100:02", "database especially a blockchain is not", "100:05", "easy so the idea that you can go on the", "100:08", "internet do crazy shit and then just", "100:11", "have it taken away it's a paradox", "100:15", "because privacy means control but you", "100:21", "know it doesn't jive with the way that", "100:24", "technology works to

I just went punch that", "100:34", "guy in the face and the bar and I just", "100:36", "want to delete that from having happened", "100:38", "right yeah yeah and again I think that", "100:46", "what

that's yeah that's what", "101:39", "he's talking so a million try and turn", "101:43", "us into robots so but the question is", "101:45", "what's the nature of those robots robots", "101:47", "are going to exist they they exist right", "101:49", "but should you shoot them into your", "101:51", "brain if you're dying of cancer would", "101:54", "you or it yeah I'd want to see God it", "101:58", "suits up so like do the nanobots you", "102:01", "know that Kurzweil talks about like do", "102:02", "we have control as a community over", "102:05", "those robots what's what's the code", "102:08", "running those saying are they infallible", "102:10", "I mean what if they crap I mean our", "102:12", "fucking TriCaster crashes every other", "102:14", "podcast yeah whether it's open source or", "102:16", "free or not makes no difference to", "102:18", "whether it can fuck up your brain right", "102:20", "what if somebody puts that shit in and", "102:21", "then for whatever reason they have a", "102:23", "blown fuse and they stomp on the gas and", "102:25", "drive right into a tree it depends on", "102:27", "the level of risk you're willing to take", "102:28", "I mean you see some of those videos like", "102:30", "I've cried out those videos where like", "102:31", "the the woman like here's for the first", "102:33", "time you're like yeah yeah yeah and", "102:36", "people seeing color for the first time", "102:38", "putting on certain glasses that allow", "102:39", "them see color yeah all the stuff is", "102:41", "amazing", "102:42", "I mean that all that stuff is very cool", "102:44", "and in talking to David Sinclair and he", "102:47", "was talking about emerging technologies", "102:49", "in with reversing aging and age-related", "102:52", "diseases I mean we're we're entering or", "102:55", "entering into an incredibly strange time", "102:58", "for the the influence of technology and", "103:02", "innovation on human beings on our bodies", "103:04", "and our brains oh and we're gonna have", "103:06", "to decide you know how how far you want", "103:09", "to go on this ride", "103:10", "next stop Far Rockaway like when you get", "103:12", "now I live there yeah as I've done the", "103:15", "beach there I'm going but you know I'm", "103:19", "saying it's like one of those things", "103:20", "like wet where do you get off like when", "103:21", "where do you go that okay that's enough", "103:24", "you know like with you you're deleting", "103:26", "Facebook you lead to delete Instagram", "103:28", "and you go just gonna be on mines and", "103:30", "that's enough I'll go in other places I", "103:32", "mean that these there are out", "103:34", "alternatives that are getting fair", "103:36", "big yes what so and and together like", "103:39", "what like signal has tens of millions of", "103:42", "users I don't know what that is you've", "103:43", "never heard of it that's like the", "103:45", "encrypted messaging app that do you know", "103:47",

not gonna solve it by", "104:26", "ourselves and it would be way easier if", "104:29", "one of these big companies would just", "104:31", "switch gears and start doing things the", "104:33", "right way I mean we've spent eight years", "104:36", "building this if one of the big", "104:39", "companies Google Facebook had just been", "104:42", "free and open source we would have spent", "104:45", "the last seven years building on top of", "104:47", "them right because you know they already", "104:50", "did something cool that they're sharing", "104:51", "with everybody so it's it's actually", "104:54", "closed source projects stifle innovation", "104:57", "because if you think we had to reinvent", "104:59", "the wheel we literally we went and built", "105:00", "an alternative with much of

yeah that would be great for", "105:31", "you but why would that be great for them", "105:33", "I mean they they're obviously in a", "105:35", "business now the problem with the", "105:37", "businesses this business is the business", "105:38", "of distributing information and then we", "105:41", "have to decide okay at what point in", "105:43", "time do we allow these air quotes", "105:46", "overlords to dictate what can and cannot", "105:48", "be distributed and how do", "105:50", "this happened because in the beginning I", "105:52", "bet it didn't happen I bet in the",

maybe we", "105:59", "shouldn't have this on like hey if we're", "106:02", "gonna sell advertising we really should", "106:04", "maximize the amount of clicks okay how", "106:06", "do we do that well we put things in", "106:07", "people's feeds they want to see we put", "106:09", "things that people want to debate about", "106:11", "and argue about and political things all", "106:13", "sorts of

"106:31", "maximizing the amount of eyes that get", "106:34", "to their advertising so they get more", "106:35", "clicks and more people get engaged", "106:37", "that's what their businesses you're", "106:39", "deciding by saying if they were open", "106:42", "source look how much further on the", "106:44", "world would be they would be further", "106:45", "along to I don't know if they would", "106:46", "agree with that I think they're they're", "106:48", "worth fuckin kajillions of dollars so", "106:50", "they've figured it out well it just", "106:51", "depends on whether or not you think that", "106:54", "people have a right to know what is", "106:57", "going on it's I mean it's like food", "106:59", "transparency well yeah we were yeah we", "107:01", "I'll talk about that I will talk

playing", "107:12", "devil's advocate by saying that in their", "107:14", "position they have a business and their", "107:17", "business is to make money and they're", "107:18", "gonna lose because of what they're doing", "107:20", "because if their businesses up even", "107:24", "after losing access users are they yeah", "107:26", "but I thought their business went up", "107:28", "after the probably did it but it's not", "107:30", "gonna last I mean look I they say that", "107:32", "it's just the game's over it's gonna", "107:35", "take a long time for us to build it up", "107:37", "as you know all of these different", "107:39", "organizations and companies working", "107:41", "together but Linux for instance is the", "107:46", "operating system that most banks it is", "107:49", "the most popular operating system the", "107:50", "world it's open so it's in your phone", "107:53", "it's in everywhere mm-hmm it got there", "107:57", "because of that because everyone used it",
