space that pasta lab", "25:41", "is a big space but it's so cool to be", "25:44", "sitting right there it's a showstopper", "25:45", "yeah I really it's it's something", "25:47", "special and it worked out we're making", "25:50", "money and we're running there's always", "25:53", "like priek of it you know and there's no", "25:56", "thought there's no guidelines in terms", "25:58", "of like when you'll be able to operate", "26:00", "at a hundred percent capacity no I mean", "26:03", "in the documents that say it says", "26:05", "they're going to reassess in 21 days so", "26:10", "I don't know when that's gonna be", "26:11", "they might it might even be quicker than", "26:13", "that right I think the economic", "26:15", "pressures", "26:16", "I probably would force them to open", "26:18", "without letting anybody in they're out", "26:19", "of money they can't just say you know", "26:23", "there is a balance between people's", "26:24", "health and the economy and they can't", "26:26", "just shut everything down and say well", "26:28", "we're just gonna print a bunch of money", "26:29", "we're all gonna be paying for this in", "26:30", "the end right right now it's been two", "26:32", "trillion dollars and you know because of", "26:35", "kovat they have to get us back up and", "26:38", "running and working and I've said from", "26:40", "the very beginning get you're young and", "26:41", "you're healthy back out and working and", "26:44", "if you're over the age of 65 or if you", "26:46", "have underlying health conditions and", "26:47", "you should definitely stay at home you", "26:49", "have to wait for either treatment or the", "26:51", "vaccine but you know they have to open", "26:55", "up the economy and it's been ridiculous", "26:57", "how it's been handled yeah that's what", "26:58", "should have been done it should have", "26:59", "been they should have I mean instead of", "27:01", "taking this blanket approach but I think", "27:03", "there was a lot of misconceptions they", "27:05", "thought it was going to be something", "27:05", "different than it was even at 60% though", "27:08", "at least at 60% I'm like happy you're", "27:11", "gonna be able to be in when are you guys", "27:13", "gonna open up Monday have you figured", "27:15", "well then we protest and we had to board", "27:18", "up and you know I think we're probably", "27:21", "another week or so away at least it's", "27:23", "really about getting staff back in that", "27:25", "that's our kind of so what is protest", "27:28", "die down then a week maybe a little yeah", "27:31", "maybe a little more weird even with the", "27:34", "60% capacity it's we will see if we'll", "27:38", "be able to maintain you know and", "27:40", "actually not necessarily make a profit", "27:42", "just stay open yeah I think I think the", "27:45", "the goal has always been when this first", "27:47", "started was you know your goal is to to", "27:51", "survive and to get to the other side of", "27:53", "this you're not you're not thinking", "27:54", "about making money and when you see", "27:56", "these like iconic legendary", "27:58", "restaurateurs like daniel hume with", "28:02", "Eleven Madison Park which last year was", "28:03", "the number one restaurant the world and", "28:05", "he does not think that he will be", "28:07", "reopening so he might be closing",

you", "28:25", "know some some experts will say they", "28:28", "think 50% of restaurants will not make", "28:29", "it to the", "28:30", "other side I don't agree but I think 25%", "28:32", "won't make it and even in LA one of my", "28:35", "last dinners was at bone tom in downtown", "28:39", "LA Lincoln Carson an amazing chef I was", "28:43", "blown away by the restaurant and he's", "28:45",
