afford the Diaz brothers and Tony", "11:48", "wasn't the same as it is rather it's a", "11:51", "different news whether it's a different", "11:52", "thing now but but he had it because of", "11:54",

these", "12:14", "brother they're both the Diaz brothers", "12:16", "are like so that's a different level but", "12:18", "having them take that fight on short", "12:21", "notice to", "12:22", "but Connor was the main draws my point", "12:23", "congressman Donovan idea but this isn't", "12:26", "because I agree it's he's the main draw", "12:29", "if you're calling you're his manager he", "12:32", "going let's fight Tony who's a tough", "12:33", "fucking matchup but he's not as big as", "12:35", "the name as a guy like Nate Diaz at 55", "12:38", "who we're gonna make more money maybe", "12:40", "not as tough as a fight bigger name so", "12:43", "they're doing it from a business point", "12:44", "and he's not fighting you I'm not", "12:47", "fighting could be you also have to fight", "12:48", "in a normal fight for they're gonna do a", "12:50", "Russia card and when they do a Russia", "12:52", "card they want to do a rush card with", "12:54", "Conor or with heavy rather so when they", "12:57", "do a Russia card with Habib it's most", "12:59", "likely gonna be for a title I would", "13:00", "imagine so no time it all depends if", "13:02", "Connor accepts it remember another house", "13:04", "on all the Pete Tony and in my current", "13:06", "interim and apparently they offered it", "13:08", "to Tony and Tony said that you want to", "13:10", "make the same amount of money that Habib", "13:11", "makes which is perfectly funds first", "13:13", "fine", "13:14", "but you know they said nope you got a", "13:15", "contract you gotta honor your contract", "13:17", "that's at least how it's been explained", "13:19", "yes that's that's being explaining to go", "13:21", "no well you sign these contracts you", "13:23", "gotta honor the contract yeah but that", "13:25", "that

"of a million dollars yeah yeah it's", "13:55", "tricky man because I get the idea that", "13:57", "they would want to protect Conor um you", "13:59", "know and really set up the big-money", "14:01", "fights especially now cuz he's the", "14:03", "biggest guy but then you got Connor", "14:04", "who's kind of fuckin crazy and like what", "14:07", "the way he does of John down Tyrone I", "14:10", "don't think it's Connor doing I think", "14:11", "it's from from a business standpoint", "14:13", "they're going what's the biggest fight", "14:15", "pot let's say you have three fights left",
