as much experience as I", "02:49", "did yeah scientific research and showed", "02:52", "the red cell generation can be", "02:55", "accelerated if it is so in those", "02:58", "circumstances then science has to update", "03:02", "what are the circumstances where their", "03:04", "cells can be regenerated it's like in 24", "03:07", "hours the body is not able to adapt to", "03:09", "the circumstances where there is a lack", "03:11", "of oxygen is have the oxygen and less", "03:14", "and we go into the altitude on", "03:16", "Kilimanjaro is a like 20,000 feet at the", "03:20", "top so at say 15,000 feet the the", "03:24", "acclimatization that the adaptation is", "03:27", "not as fast in human bodies now we found", "03:31", "this breathing techniques and using the", "03:34", "mind and that enables us to accelerate", "03:37", "that what they thought what science is", "03:40", "thinking that that it is arranged", "03:43", "autonomically so outside of our will and", "03:46", "we cannot interfere we cannot intervene", "03:49", "now so we will show that with a like 30", "03:54", "people by the way past January I did it", "03:58", "with a person 76 years old without prior", "04:03", "mountaineering experience and he did it", "04:05", "in 44 hours", "04:06", "don't 76 I mean it's a robust 76 year", "04:10", "old right now but he was a good guy way", "04:13", "yes that so

how", "04:27", "much red cell red blood cells they can", "04:29", "generate is observed and they thought", "04:32", "that it was at 15,000 feet it became too", "04:34", "difficult but you've shown that with", "04:37", "your exercises and when your deep", "04:39", "breathing techniques that you can", "04:41", "actually accelerate red blood cell count", "04:44", "consciously or at least not consciously", "04:47", "you're through conscious action", "04:49", "conscious action using the breath what", "04:52", "techniques you use in the same what we", "04:54", "did last time but then adapted to while", "04:57", "you are walking and when you know first", "05:00", "sign of AMS lack of oxygen in the head", "05:03", "means headache mm-hmm", "05:05", "AMS is acute mountain sickness and first", "05:09", "iron is headache and that means a lack", "05:11", "of oxygen inside the brain normally we", "05:13", "are not able to get oxygen then at that", "05:17", "moment inside the brain to equal the", "05:19", "balance that this balance the lack of", "05:21", "oxygen and I've learned just to do that", "05:24", "so we tackle the problem and keep on", "05:27", "able to perform in the extreme", "05:30", "conditions even so through this", "05:32", "technique of taking these enormous deep", "05:35", "breaths letting some of it out and then", "05:37", "trying to refill and then letting some",

that", "05:53", "it is we use the lungs it's the", "05:54", "passageway but it gets into the", "05:57", "lymphatic system it gets into the tissue", "05:59", "you know what we just found with the", "06:01", "university in in Germany they found out", "06:04", "that the devices that showed that we", "06:08", "have hundred-percent blood saturation", "06:11", "oxygen in the blood is not 100% we go", "06:16", "more they found it out with so what they", "06:19", "thought was 100% blood saturation", "06:21", "there's actually a higher level above", "06:23", "that yes and that's what I always said", "06:26", "but now it's a it's like proofing and", "06:29", "now I you know for people listening it", "06:31", "might be in one of those valleys it's", "06:32", "like don't try to just get through it", "06:36", "mmm really ask", "06:38", "you know why what can I learn from this", "06:40", "that was my biggest thing is I stopped", "06:43", "asking why is this happening to me and", "06:46", "started asking what can I learn yeah so", "06:49", "instead of painting yourself as a victim", "06:51", "you paint yourself as someone who is", "06:52", "present in the moment and just okay I", "06:54", "don't want to do this anymore right", "06:55", "let's figure out what's going on exactly", "06:57", "and we don't a lot of times we don't", "06:58", "have the tools and that's where things", "07:00",

"addiction is such a problem is because", "07:27", "we don't really learn how to manage", "07:29", "emotion and how to manage disappointment", "07:32", "and so we go for that thing that makes", "07:34", "us feel better in the moment but the", "07:36", "problem is we have to keep upping the", "07:37", "ante you know the at first that one", "07:41", "glass of wine does the trick but then", "07:43", "you need to then you need three then you", "07:44", "need vodka me whatever it may be and so", "07:46", "I mean why I'm so passionate about what", "07:49", "I do is first of all I never I never", "07:52", "thought I could be happy like I really", "07:55", "didn't I thought that this you know I I", "07:58", "was going to be depressed and I just was", "08:01", "gonna constantly be looking for", "08:03", "something to fix me I never really truly", "08:06", "thought this life that I'm living now", "08:09", "was possible again externally things", "08:11", "look fine but internally I'm talking", "08:13", "about a totally different kind of", "08:14", "experience and it's only because of", "08:17", "those like really awful moments I call", "08:20", "them expectation hangovers that
