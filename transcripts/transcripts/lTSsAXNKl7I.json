"05:12", "know that are reporters they don't act", "05:13", "like this", "05:14", "no I think he likes attention and I", "05:17", "think he feels like something there's", "05:20", "something very

the", "05:28", "world on his shoulders and but for him", "05:30", "we'd be facing Nazi Germany yeah it's", "05:33", "it's the question is like when does", "05:36", "someone get their press credentials", "05:38", "removed from the White House when when", "05:40", "can they no longer have White House", "05:42", "credentials when is what is woody what", "05:44", "do you have to do to the point where", "05:46", "everyone agrees you're a nuisance and", "05:48", "you're interrupting regularly CNN could", "05:51", "just get someone else right who's not", "05:53", "going to scream out right it's not like", "05:54", "they're trying to block CNN it's like", "05:56", "they're saying to this guy like you you", "05:58", "you're interrupting like you're yelling", "06:00", "things out and then what if everyone", "06:02", "yelled things out at the same time are", "06:04", "you better than everyone else because", "06:05", "you're not you're just a person here and", "06:07", "if you just decide my opinion and my", "06:10", "voice is more significant than anyone", "06:12", "elses well you you've thrown everybody", "06:15", "else under the bus the entire rest of", "06:17", "the room and the whole process well I", "06:18", "remember Lesley Stahl had Trump on to 60", "06:20", "minutes not that long ago and you know", "06:21", "they were going back and forth and she", "06:23", "goes well you know well I don't want to", "06:24", "talk about that I'm like this is the", "06:25", "fucking president you're a reporter", "06:27", "if he wants to talk about it at the very", "06:29", "least it's gonna be the president says X", "06:30", "Y Z so who are you to be like Nana shut", "06:32", "up we're not gonna talk about this and", "06:33", "he's like well fuck you I'm the", "06:34", "president yeah so I think there is and", "06:37", "I'm glad this is happening because I", "06:39", "think for a long time", "06:40", "the press who has had an agenda since", "06:41", "Washington's days is they should have an", "06:43", "agenda pretend that they're honest and", "06:45", "objective and they use the veneer of", "06:47", "politeness and civility to be like look", "06:49", "for professional or decent people but", "06:51", "now the mask is dropping and you see", "06:53", "that there you know often lunatics yeah", "06:56", "I was watching this piece on I really", "07:00", "wish I remember what it was on but it", "07:02", "was on maybe I was listening to it", "07:04", "either way it was on the news and when", "07:07", "the news started becoming an", "07:08", "entertainment program versus when it was", "07:11", "just here's the events of the day and", "07:14", "this is you know this is what the the", "07:17", "significance of these events could be", "07:19", "and this is the impact it could have on", "07:20", "our society instead it just became this", "07:23", "really flamboyant wild crazy if it", "07:28", "bleeds it leads", "07:29", "and it became entertainment right and", "07:31", "they really narrowed it down to 60", "07:34", "minutes there so when 60 minutes became", "07:36", "a hugely successful financial show", "07:39", "what's that the 70s then somewhere", "07:41", "around there yeah right well in 60", "07:42", "minutes it's been around for a long long", "07:44", "time long long time but when 60 minutes", "07:47", "became a hit it was a hit show like big", "07:50", "advertiser money it was you know the", "07:52", "entire country would watch it and then", "07:54", "that sort of changed the way they viewed", "07:57", "the news because now they view the news", "07:59", "as a potentially profitable venture and", "08:01", "then boy once they've realized that", "08:04", "people can clearly affiliate with one", "08:07", "side versus another side and they want", "08:09", "that in their news coverage then you get", "08:11", "the weird Fox News / CNN a bias which is", "08:15", "it is one of the weirdest Poehler like", "08:19", "it distinctions if you watch the news", "08:21", "you watch television during the", "08:22", "elections in particular anything that's", "08:24", "really significant going on you go back", "08:26", "and forth between two of them like are", "08:27", "we there's like separate universes oh", "08:29", "yeah Scott Adams has that metaphor which", "08:32", "is that we're looking at one movie", "08:34", "screen and there's two movies on one", "08:35", "movie screen then different people see", "08:37", "the exact same data and see different", "08:39", "conclusions yes and I think that's great", "08:42", "I mean I think I don't think we need to", "08:44", "be all United I think people should like", "08:46", "what they like and the idea that we all", "08:47", "got agree and everything is", "08:49", "totalitarianism yeah I mean I definitely", "08:52", "think that we should be able to", "08:53", "enjoy what we enjoy and we should lean", "08:56", "whatever way would choose to mean I", "08:58", "think the issue with the news though is", "08:59", "when it's just straight-up propaganda", "09:01", "yeah like when is when is this actually", "09:03", "the real objective version of the events", "09:07", "or when are they deleting and editing", "09:09", "stuff out and adding things to write", "09:12", "concentrating on one maybe possibly", "09:14", "insignificant thing but pumping it up to", "09:16", "be more than it is because then it", "09:18", "changes the narrative for their side", "09:19", "this morning I went after some dimwit", "09:22", "from Emison from excuse me from NBC and", "09:24", "he goes this is the worst attack by the", "09:25", "White House and the press freedoms in", "09:27", "history I go John Adams second president", "09:30", "put journalists in jail so did Lincoln a", "09:32", "Lincoln of course you could say okay was", "09:33", "the Civil War but there are in many", "09:35", "cases of attacks on the press but of", "09:36", "course because everyone's so", "09:38", "narcissistic if it's happening to them", "09:39", "it's the worst thing ever and this is", "09:41", "basically the gulag even though they can", "09:43", "go on Twitter and have their hundred", "09:44", "thousand followers I have their good", "09:45", "book deals the consequence is anybody", "09:48", "criticizing Jim Acosta from the left is", "09:50", "anybody saying like hey you're not", "09:52", "supposed to do that", "09:53", "like what you did what you did is out of", "09:55", "line I haven't I have I've been having", "09:58", "fun in LA I have not seen that I think", "10:00", "they have been running interference", "10:01", "because I do think that the press corps", "10:03", "like any organization you work with", "10:04", "someone side by side every day you're", "10:06", "gonna be friendly with them yeah and and", "10:08", "I do think they there is very much", "10:10", "obviously acrimony between Sarah Sanders", "10:12", "and the White House press corps and", "10:14", "she's very insulting and hostile to them", "10:16", "and you could say it's deserved or not", "10:18", "so of course they're gonna kind of team", "10:20", "up together be like lady we're just", "10:21", "trying to do our job and you're just", "10:23", "spinning on our face every single day", "10:24", "now the question is do these people", "10:26", "should have their faces spittin or not", "10:28", "well is it I think they both suck you", "10:33", "know I think what she's doing sucks like", "10:35", "the way she treats people like some", "10:37", "she's some fucking schoolteacher in", "10:39", "seventh grade that's that's what it", "10:41", "seems like when Sarah's doing those", "10:42", "those White House press things I love", "10:46", "venom so I love that the venom is", "10:48", "flowing in both directions and they like", "10:51", "it because I I think people get over", "10:54", "politically by saying let's all get", "10:57", "along and then people who don't get", "10:59", "along are marginalized and those are the", "11:01", "ones who innovate things the the", "11:02", "troublemakers are the ones who move", "11:04", "culture and move politics so whenever", "11:06", "everyone gets together like all 90", "11:07", "I must agree then where its venom it's", "11:10", "like yeah if this country has been to at", "11:12", "least two culture since the beginning", "11:13", "and it only stayed one because one", "11:16", "conquered the other and held it under", "11:17", "martial law for decades there's no", "11:19", "reason for us to be one United
