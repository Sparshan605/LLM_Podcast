"08:03", "remove the dam and get the water to run", "08:06", "back again at that time no no one is", "08:08", "doing it right and that's that's exactly", "08:11", "really what really really kind of upset", "08:12", "me and again we were new at the game we", "08:15", "were the game wardens nobody really", "08:16", "thought of us as mainline law", "08:19", "enforcement or you know Narcotics Task", "08:20", "Force guys or anything like that at the", "08:22", "time so I wasn't gonna make waves we", "08:24", "just wanted to integrate and work", "08:25", "together we wanted to unify these teams", "08:27", "and what I really wanted to do at this", "08:29", "point is get back with my command staff", "08:31", "and you know my bosses and go hey we got", "08:34", "a big big problem out there man and", "08:36", "right there's more of this going on and", "08:38", "we need to be involved even though it's", "08:40", "not traditional because we're sworn to", "08:42", "protect our resources and well besides", "08:44", "everything game wardens do that you", "08:46", "think of from the wildlife standpoint or", "08:49", "mainline law enforcement just like every", "08:50", "police officer right we", "08:51", "through the same training and then what", "08:53", "people don't realize is we go through", "08:55", "two more months of additional training", "08:56", "and a really long Academy that's all", "08:58", "wildlife specific wildlife forensics", "09:00", "wildlife ID weapons identification all", "09:03", "the things you really need to do the", "09:05", "game or inside of it with wildlife you", "09:07", "know in the backcountry so to speak but", "09:11", "we needed to integrate with other", "09:12", "agencies and kind of bring them into our", "09:13", "world if we were going to participate so", "09:15", "that one case started the change in me", "09:19", "to try to build those relationships and", "09:21", "get into tactics and tactical circles", "09:23", "with some of these you know SWAT and", "09:25", "Special Operations units that would go", "09:27", "in and do this job under normal", "09:28", "circumstances if that was just being", "09:31", "diverted by a rancher so if a rancher", "09:33", "had done that and the cake was dry how", "09:35", "would you how would you fix that we", "09:38", "would have got with him and it was", "09:40", "what's called a stream adulteration", "09:41", "violation and as 16:02 in our Fish and", "09:43", "Game codes the section but and it's a", "09:45", "very common section because water is", "09:47", "diverted for a lot of reasons and you", "09:49", "can divert water with a permit in", "09:50", "certain circumstances but you can't", "09:52", "completely denude a creek that has", "09:54", "Wildlife thriving that's a waterway of", "09:56", "the state for everybody to enjoy which", "09:57", "this one was and if normally the case", "10:00", "would be that they would have to Reeve", "10:01", "just have the the flow come back to", "10:04", "exactly how it was before so exactly the", "10:07", "dam and yep that would be up to the", "10:10", "rancher that would be up to the rancher", "10:11", "would be part of a penalty you know it", "10:13", "could be a civil it could be a criminal", "10:14", "it could be a probationary fix-it your", "10:16", "okay so this was no real there's no law", "10:20", "involved or nothing in place rather just", "10:22", "when you found these grow-ops like there", "10:25", "was no previous precedent right exactly", "10:28", "it was it was completely brand-new and", "10:30", "this was you know one of the first grows", "10:32", "I think that any of us have found", "10:34", "throughout the state of California is", "10:35", "game wardens I mean there are other guys", "10:37", "finding some things and working but", "10:38", "being from the Silicon Valley and being", "10:40", "inspired by those wild lands to", "10:42", "everything I became later and what I", "10:44", "stand for it was home you know when it", "10:46", "hit home but seeing that and getting to", "10:49", "meet certain guys from the Sheriff's", "10:51", "Department my first book goes into this", "10:53", "whole learning experience of you know", "10:55", "ad-hoc jumping in with other agencies", "10:57", "and doing it is this the hidden war this", "10:59", "was the first book war in the woods", "11:00", "war in the woods yes so the war in the", "11:02", "woods and then hidden war is the new one", "11:04", "yeah hidden", "11:05", "the brand-new one that just came out and", "11:06", "they're basically 10 years apart and the", "11:08", "cool part about that Joe is when you", "11:10", "look at the difference as we do some", "11:11", "major comparisons and what war in the", "11:14", "woods covers is that chapter ones that", "11:16", "first mission I'm telling you right now", "11:17", "because that was like being here it is", "11:19", "right we're not in Kansas anymore", "11:21", "it was crazy the people at the", "11:22", "higher-ups yeah that we're in charge of", "11:26", "trying to eradicate the grow up and take", "11:29", "the cartel the guys down what so there", "11:32", "that was their job was just handling", "11:34", "that it was just handling the the", "11:36", "marijuana aspect of it right right and", "11:38", "the armed cartel guys so there was no", "11:41", "one in place that was supposed to take", "11:43", "care of the waterway there wasn't that", "11:45", "seems so crazy today it does it was one", "11:48", "of those things that it was it was based", "11:49", "on the fact that a conservation group", "11:52", "like from an agency like Fish and", "11:54", "Wildlife like us we just weren't", "11:56", "involved where we would be looking at", "11:57", "those environmental damages right right", "11:59", "but from a narcotics officer standpoint", "12:01", "you may see the damages but it may not", "12:04", "register there might not be a you know a", "12:06", "mandate or even objective to clean that", "12:07", "stuff up and and back at the time DEA", "12:10", "was funding all of our states and all of", "12:13", "our county teams based on the number of", "12:16", "marijuana plants we eradicated so there", "12:18", "wasn't any recognition of the", "12:21", "environmental damages and any type of", "12:23", "funding based on how much reclamation", "12:25", "and cleanup you didn't know I would", "12:26", "change fortunately and we were that we", "12:29", "were a big part of making that change", "12:30", "fortunately but and there wasn't a lot", "12:32", "of funding or you know point kickback or", "12:35", "value to catching bad guys to catching", "12:37", "some of these guys that were doing the", "12:38", "damages so a lot of teams then were", "12:41", "dropping in on helicopter lines cutting", "12:44", "plants getting a big plant count getting", "12:46", "funded for it taking taking the weed out", "12:48", "and that was it so crazy like yeah I", "12:52", "would imagine I mean obviously I don't", "12:54", "work in law enforcement no but I would", "12:56", "imagine there would be one person who", "12:57", "would like detail plan right and I would", "13:01", "think that well what happened well we", "13:03", "found out that this Creek was yeah yeah", "13:04", "okay well we've got to resume the creek", "13:06", "yeah wouldn't that be like part of the", "13:08", "plan it would and it you would think it", "13:12", "should be right but it's all basically", "13:14", "new territory completely new and so", "13:16", "we're only talking about 15 years ago", "13:18", "well which is really crazy yeah it was", "13:21", "it was the start of a big shift in my", "13:23", "career because I saw this as a big", "13:25", "problem", "13:25", "I also up until in 2005 we were on you", "13:30", "know one of our first second third since", "13:32", "third operation since this one we just", "13:34", "mentioned in 2004 ending August 5th of", "13:37", "2005 the game completely changed because", "13:40", "that's when we were involved in our", "13:41", "first gun fight and that's when my", "13:43", "partner warden who had trained in the", "13:45", "Academy we were partners in the squad", "13:47", "I had promoted to be the lieutenant for", "13:49", "two and a half counties the Silicon", "13:51", "Valley Santa Clara County Monterey part", "13:53", "of San Benito 20 days before this", "13:56", "incident happened and I had young", "13:58", "wardens that wanted to participate and", "14:00", "do some of the stuff I was doing with", "14:02", "the other agencies on the marijuana you", "14:03", "know operational front and this was you", "14:07", "know right above the tech capital of the", "14:08", "world right there in Silicon Valley in", "14:09", "Los Gatos we were in really steep arid", "14:11", "country you know August right before the", "14:13", "a zone deer opener we were all gearing", "14:15", "up for that and was three game wardens", "14:17", "three sheriff's officers good sheriff's", "14:20", "officers that we met on that first", "14:21", "operation in 2004 I just gave you the", "14:23", "story on and um they were in harvest", "14:27", "time they were fortified they had heavy", "14:29", "weapons like SKS is the ak-47 derivative", "14:32", "sawed-off shotguns and they had the", "14:35", "grouse set up where they were basically", "14:36", "defending it and when we came in there", "14:39", "was an ambush shot from one of the", "14:41", "growers and that was the one shot the", "14:43", "bad guys got off and unfortunately", "14:45", "that's the shot that hit my partner", "14:47", "through both legs and that bullet went", "14:49", "through the right thigh and tumbled", "14:51", "through his right leg then kept going", "14:53", "through his left so he's down and we're", "14:56", "trying to keep him from bleeding out of", "14:58", "four holes for the better part of three", "14:59", "hours waiting for an air rescue and we", "15:02", "didn't you know nobody in the country", "15:03", "from the standpoint of a law enforcement", "15:05", "team had ever been counter-attacked by", "15:07", "these growers we'd you know we chased", "15:09", "him around they run away sometimes we'd", "15:11", "find weapons oftentimes we wouldn't but", "15:14", "so this was just a real eye-opener like", "15:16", "what the fuck did we just walk into and", "15:18", "plus my partner was real close to not", "15:21", "making it and fortunately he did survive", "15:23", "or I don't know that we'd be sitting", "15:24", "here telling this story and talking", "15:25", "about it but that day when I saw how", "15:28", "well they were equipped", "15:30", "the type of weaponry they had and the", "15:32", "fact that I don't almost didn't come", "15:33", "home that day I went okay this is super", "15:37", "dangerous we can't do this as standard", "15:39", "patrol Game Wardens we can't do this", "15:41", "doing just the traditional stuff we", "15:43", "should stay involved in it because aside", "15:46", "from being so violent the environmental", "15:47", "damage is Joe we're the worst I'd still", "15:49", "ever seen and they just kept getting", "15:50", "worse and worse the more operations I'd", "15:52", "work in my home county right so we", "15:54", "learned a lot from that there were a lot", "15:56", "of tactical lessons there are a lot of", "15:57", "team lessons a lot of things we could", "16:00", "have done different and that kind of", "16:01", "changed the game where we eventually got", "16:03", "to what we're going to talk about a", "16:04", "little bit later now since 2004 have", "16:06", "there been plans implemented to clean up", "16:10", "but also restore waterways and all the", "16:12", "different absolutely yeah absolutely and", "16:14", "so now there's like a whole they realize", "16:16", "this is an issue and so there's there's", "16:18", "precedent there's very much so and and", "16:21", "that largely came from what we saw you", "16:23", "know in those early years the 2004 first", "16:26", "stop on down there on Dexter Canyon", "16:28", "Creek and then what we had on Sierra's", "16:30", "ol well my partner was shot in 2005", "16:32", "about then we started also see the", "16:35", "banned poisons in these grows like the", "16:36", "carbo fury on bottles and just to give a", "16:39", "background this stuff is so deadly it", "16:42", "was made as an insecticide rodenticide", "16:44", "just to kill anything that you put on", "16:45", "any type of agricultural product and it", "16:48", "was made originally back and I think", "16:50", "like the 50s for legitimate agriculture", "16:52", "and then they found out how toxic it was", "16:54", "an EPA banned it from use or even", "16:58", "possession it's a felony to have it in", "16:59", "the country and use it anywhere without", "17:01", "special licenses through legitimate", "17:03", "channels here in America and they ban it", "17:06", "like 15 years ago because it was so", "17:07", "nasty but because it does keep", "17:10", "everything off the marijuana plants I", "17:11", "mean nothing can even get near it", "17:13", "without dying almost instantly they", "17:15", "still get it in third-world countries", "17:16", "they can get it in Mexico and it gets", "17:19", "smuggled across the border with the grow", "17:20", "groups the drug trafficking groups", "17:22", "because it's so effective regardless how", "17:24", "poison it is and we were starting to see", "17:26", "more and more of that stuff as we were", "17:28", "starting to ramp more of a specialty to", "17:30", "do in this job more you know thoroughly", "17:31", "and safely and get into the cleanup this", "17:34", "is one of the many things I brought this", "17:36", "up with Dan Crenshaw the other day and I", "17:37", "talked about you and because he's", "17:40", "against federally", "17:43", "getting marijuana federally legal and I", "17:45", "said one of the problems with it being", "17:46", "illegal is this and I was explaining", "17:48", "these grow-ops that for the rest of the", "17:50", "country where marijuana is illegal right", "17:52", "the vast majority like what was the", "17:54", "number that you said the percentage that", "17:56", "was is grown in California that's", "17:59", "illegally sold through the rest of the", "18:01", "country 7080 percent so 70% of the", "18:04", "entire marijuana population or marijuana", "18:08", "product that you're buying if you live", "18:10", "in in place like South Dakota wherever I", "18:12", "don't even know it's legal in South", "18:14", "Dakota wherever it's illegal right", "18:15", "they're buying it from here exactly and", "18:18", "it's because one of the reasons is", "18:20", "because our state laws say that well", "18:23", "first of all we're close to Mexico so", "18:24", "the cartel members can come up really", "18:26", "quickly right and then the other problem", "18:28", "is that our state laws one we made", "18:30", "marijuana legal recreationally here weak", "18:33", "severely lowered the penalty for an", "18:36", "illegal grow-op it became a misdemeanor", "18:39", "correct that was the that was the thing", "18:41", "you know when when we started the the", "18:43", "department's special team that the", "18:45", "SpecOps marijuana Enforcement team that", "18:47", "hid more goes into part of my job is", "18:50", "being the co-founder of that and the", "18:52", "team leader was outreach so I was", "18:54", "speaking to legislative groups before we", "18:56", "legalized under Prop 64 and then the", "18:59", "tighter medicinal marijuana laws that", "19:01", "came about that same time and I was", "19:04", "talking to anybody", "19:05", "conservation groups that you and I would", "19:07", "you know be part of preservation animal", "19:09", "rights groups high school kids you know", "19:11", "it assemblies right watch out you know", "19:13", "if you're using weed make sure you're", "19:15", "not using this stuff because it's so", "19:16", "nasty things like that and my whole", "19:19", "point was if we're gonna regulate guys", "19:21", "we see it comin let's just regulate", "19:23", "smart", "19:23", "let's not lessen any penalties for the", "19:26", "trespass grow that the cartels are doing", "19:28", "in our public lands and private lands", "19:30", "and also the other gang groups and", "19:31", "there's there's other groups you know to", "19:33", "a smaller extent but unfortunately when", "19:36", "we did regulate and all that was passed", "19:38", "two years ago they did water it down so", "19:41", "publicly and cultivation went to like", "19:43", "you said a felony to a misdemeanor and", "19:45", "if you're a juvenile cultivator on", "19:48", "public private land and one of these", "19:50", "juvenile you know cartel members and", "19:52", "there's a lot of young ones learning", "19:53", "it's a it's an infraction and that took", "19:55", "a lot of", "19:56", "assists away from that part of the", "19:57", "problem and left us out there basically", "19:59", "alone with a couple other agencies to", "20:01", "fight it well for the average person", "20:02", "that would sound before you knew about", "20:04", "the cartel grows that would sound like a", "20:06", "good idea well hey if marijuana is legal", "20:08", "what's the problem what's a big deal", "20:10", "exactly then the other problem is these", "20:13", "people that are buying this marijuana in", "20:15", "the rest of the country it's highly", "20:16", "likely that they're gonna have some of", "20:18", "that pesticide on it right and how bad", "20:21", "is that stuff is that stuff ever killed", "20:22", "someone from smoking this illegal", "20:25", "marijuana we don't know if it's killed", "20:26", "anybody directly because by the time it", "20:29", "gets distributed throughout the country", "20:30", "it does dissipate a little bit but it's", "20:32", "still highly toxic to put it in", "20:34", "perspective about three years ago we had", "20:37", "two federal officers back east not even", "20:39", "in California in a public land grow that", "20:42", "had all that toxic on it so they have", "20:45", "cartel grows out there they do they do", "20:47", "they actually coast we have them in", "20:49", "about 20 25 to 27 other states to a much", "20:52", "lesser extent and something we need to", "20:54", "look at is California I mean we're one", "20:57", "of only six Mediterranean climates on", "20:59", "the whole globe so we are a great weed", "21:00", "growing state just like our wine", "21:01", "industry man we got great great weather", "21:03", "for it so we can grow outdoors and", "21:05", "indoors", "21:06", "I mean February to almost December right", "21:08", "and that's why it's grown here and", "21:10", "that's why the black market both in you", "21:12", "know the private land communities and", "21:14", "the cartels are everywhere across the", "21:15", "country with this stuff but they'll go", "21:18", "wherever they can - you know diversify", "21:20", "the network so we do have it in other", "21:22", "states to a much lesser extent and then", "21:24", "something we need to remember is even", "21:26", "though about half the country has these", "21:27", "grows in them to a lesser extent in", "21:30", "California these same groups are under", "21:32", "the same Enterprise they're humid doing", "21:34", "human trafficking doing gun running you", "21:36", "know to fuel the fight down in Mexico", "21:39", "methamphetamine production and now the", "21:41", "new synthetic fentanyl that's just", "21:43", "killing thousands especially on the East", "21:45", "Coast are coming from these groups so", "21:47", "it's all one enterprise and of course we", "21:49", "focus on the cannabis issue because", "21:52", "that's what's affecting our while lands", "21:53", "in our waterways it's right at the hub", "21:54", "so yeah it is it's it's nationwide it's", "21:57", "not a California problem and we made", "21:58", "really really careful even though we're", "22:01", "talking about a team in California game", "22:03", "wardens we're trying to tell a", "22:04", "nationwide story because the nation", "22:06", "needs to know well it seems like you I", "22:08", "mean it", "22:09", "just seems like it is you guys were not", "22:11", "trained for this right and there was no", "22:14", "one else there so it was like like hey", "22:16", "put it on the game wardens they're gonna", "22:18", "have to handle this now which is really", "22:19", "to me kind of insane it is but then at", "22:22", "the flipside we're really passionate", "22:24", "about protecting what you and I love", "22:26", "right our wild lands and our waterways", "22:28", "and our wildlife especially so we have a", "22:31", "passionate interest in protecting you", "22:33", "know those resources and not to mention", "22:35", "keeping our public safe in the same in", "22:36", "the same breath because these are in", "22:39", "public areas I mean we have a lot of", "22:41", "these in national parks we have like you", "22:44", "know not only you have the armed gunmen", "22:45", "that could you know shoot a

other threats that", "22:58", "come with that you know it's not just an", "23:00", "armed gunman they're putting pun Jeep", "23:02", "it's literally vietnam-era punji pit", "23:04", "Sanh some of these trails land a punji", "23:05", "pit for people don't know absolutely so", "23:07", "back in the Vietnam conflict with the", "23:10", "Vietcong would do to deter our American", "23:12", "soldiers is they dig a pit underground", "23:15", "on a trail it'll be about 18 to 20", "23:17", "inches deep and you know square to kind", "23:20", "of cover a whole trail then they cover", "23:21", "it up with bamboo or leaf litter so it", "23:24", "just looked like the trail and then our", "23:25", "soldiers would kind of walk and they'd", "23:27", "step into that and here's the sharpened", "23:29", "sticks out of bamboo they're super sharp", "23:31", "and they're pointed upwards so when you", "23:33", "step into it you're going to share a", "23:35", "shin you're going to puncture you know", "23:36", "your leg maybe an artery and they would", "23:38", "put human excrement excuse me on the", "23:41", "points to induce bacteria induced", "23:44", "infection and basically take our", "23:45", "soldiers you know out of the operation", "23:47", "well we started seeing 2015 and the", "23:50", "first one we found was actually in the", "23:51", "National Park up in Shasta County and", "23:53", "Whiskeytown", "23:53", "and it was a punji pit going into a grow", "23:57", "site on a public trail I mean it was", "23:59", "hundreds of yards Joe from the grow but", "24:01", "anybody could have walked in on it we", "24:03", "were running an operation with Shasta", "24:05", "County and this is when we had our", "24:06", "full-time dedicated team in the Hidden", "24:08", "War era and our point man was about to", "24:11", "step into this thing and arcanine Phoebe", "24:14", "that I'm sure you know we talked about a", "24:16", "nun Steven show that I'm meat-eater and", "24:18", "also Mike Ritland who has a show called", "24:20", "Mike drop and he's a seal team", "24:23", "three veteran and k9 trainer he really", "24:25", "got into the dog stories right we talked", "24:26", "about that but Phoebe amazing dog she", "24:29", "had been trained to sniff these banned", "24:31", "poisons so she could smell it you know a", "24:33", "mile out with that amazing nose our", "24:35", "canines have and right before our point", "24:38", "man was about to step into it Phoebe", "24:39", "alerted em Brian pulled everybody back", "24:42", "her handler and my teammate and sure", "24:44", "enough he did some digging and pulled", "24:45", "back the tarp and then here's this punji", "24:47", "pit and it had the banned toxics", "24:49", "actually on the sticks so what would", "24:52", "that have done if one of us had stepped", "24:53", "into it so that was a real aggressive", "24:56", "anti-personnel technique that could have", "24:57", "you know", "24:58", "that could have decimated a hunter or", "25:00", "hiker or anybody else so so that was or", "25:04", "wildlife yeah some of these pit traps", "25:06", "for wildlife and these big you know", "25:08", "wells they're diggin in cisterns and", "25:10", "they're doing this to keep people out or", "25:12", "they're doing this for animals like what", "25:14", "what are they doing something like that", "25:16", "is has to be targeted against people but", "25:18", "we have there's a lot of different", "25:19", "things for animals too there's a lot of", "25:21", "things to keep animals away from the", "25:22", "plants they'll do you know they'll dig", "25:25", "big pit traps that are they'll put", "25:27", "garbage in them or they'll use them like", "25:29", "when we were in the middle of our really", "25:31", "severe drought that we just came out of", "25:32", "here in California a couple years ago", "25:34", "all these mountain streams were just", "25:36", "bone-dry so they would go to the lower", "25:38", "lands and we were doing a lot of work", "25:40", "you know in the Delta region and", "25:41", "Sacramento Delta and the lowlands and", "25:43", "they even if they you know we're getting", "25:45", "water from the Delta and the Raceland", "25:47", "would dry up they would dig and dig", "25:49", "wells 20 30 feet deep and they'd leave", "25:52", "them open and they're getting water from", "25:54", "them and pumping out water out of the", "25:55", "bottom but those stay open so yeah our", "25:57", "big you our big game animals drop into", "25:59", "those or we could drop into them so", "26:01", "multiple hazards yeah exactly what is", "26:04", "the is there an estimate of how many", "26:07", "cartel members are growing in this", "26:09", "country right now if you say there's 27", "26:12", "28 states is that what you say what is", "26:14", "that is there a rough estimate of how", "26:16", "many cartel members are here right now", "26:18", "doing this kind of stuff this comes to", "26:20", "you know it's it's a real approximation", "26:22", "because you only know based on who you", "26:24", "catch or graph enable the debrief but", "26:27", "like in California we know from the", "26:28", "amount of grows we we deal with every", "26:30", "year just on the trespass you know", "26:32", "cartel front and the number of", "26:34", "operatives it takes to run", "26:36", "grow and get it started and then to", "26:38", "harvest it I mean a conservative", "26:40", "estimate ten thousand ten thousand yeah", "26:42", "I'd say conservatives California just in", "26:45", "California and the reason we say that", "26:46", "and I always go very conservative", "26:49", "because it's such a kind of a silent", "26:51", "enterprise and it's really hard to get", "26:52", "some of this data but we've we've just", "26:54", "validated it through the numbers of", "26:56", "things we run across you know when you", "26:58", "look at the fact that it takes two", "27:00", "skilled growers that are vetted because", "27:03", "they cut their teeth down to Mexico", "27:04", "doing it effectively under the", "27:05", "Federalist knows and they grow well and", "27:08", "and and you mentioned this one yet Mike", "27:10", "Baker on the show which was interesting", "27:11", "and you hit it on the head when you said", "27:13", "man these guys are really resourceful", "27:15", "you know you got a you respect their", "27:17", "work ethic and now and you have to", "27:19", "because they're they're hiking water", "27:21", "line they're hiking infrastructure in", "27:23", "they're covering their tracks they're", "27:26", "out there for six months at a time", "27:27", "you said they were walking around with", "27:29", "carpet strapped to their feets that", "27:31", "didn't leave footprints yeah in hid more", "27:33", "especially we have a whole lot of photos", "27:35", "in that book about things we've seen on", "27:36", "trail cameras and they will put felt", "27:39", "lined lined soft felt on their shoes tie", "27:43", "them up tight and if they're walking", "27:44", "like an Old Forest Road you know that's", "27:46", "got a gravel base you'll never see that", "27:48", "track I mean you know you you've tracked", "27:50", "big game I've done it you know it's the", "27:52", "same type of technique and if you don't", "27:53", "have any sign I mean they're really good", "27:56", "at disguise and we actually found a guy", "27:57", "and I have a picture of this in the book", "27:59", "and also in the PowerPoint when I when I", "28:01", "teach to this throughout the country cow", "28:04", "hooves actually carved out of wood", "28:06", "because a couple years ago we were you", "28:09", "know the US Forest Service a lot of this", "28:10", "grow problem is on or national forests", "28:13", "you know Northern California", "28:14", "northeastern California not so much", "28:16", "Silicon Valley where I started but the", "28:18", "rest of the state even down here and", "28:19", "what these guys would do is there's", "28:21", "cattle leases on those properties where", "28:23", "you know ranchers can run cattle on part", "28:25", "of the forest and you know or a joint on", "28:26", "private property and we were getting", "28:29", "tips on a bunch of grows you know or", "28:31", "you've seen them from the air or hunter", "28:32", "or angler would report or we'd have a", "28:34", "suspicion because of a waterway or do we", "28:36", "get see some plants from satellite or", "28:38", "whatever and we go try to find this grow", "28:40", "and we're picking up tracks and we're", "28:41", "you know we we're pretty good at finding", "28:43", "these things now we've been trial and", "28:45", "error in it for a lot a lot of years but", "28:46", "we're seeing a lot of cattle tracks", "28:48", "because we're", "28:49", "running around with cows and sure enough", "28:50", "they were putting on cow hooves and", "28:53", "strapping them on top or underneath", "28:55", "their their boots clomping around to", "28:58", "disguise themselves as cattle clever", "28:59", "right and then once I get way up into a", "29:03", "deep canyon where they're gonna put", "29:04", "their grow they just take them off and", "29:05", "throw them in a backpack and then the", "29:06", "light bulb went off we better look at", "29:08", "you know our tracks a little more", "29:09", "carefully so how do you guys try to go", "29:12", "about finding these things do you do you", "29:14", "rely on people reporting them or do you", "29:16", "have like aerial surveys but how do you", "29:20", "it's it's a mix of all of that we get a", "29:23", "lot of reports from people on the ground", "29:24", "and our best reporting parties or what", "29:28", "we call our peas are hunters and anglers", "29:30", "hmm when it comes to the outdoor public", "29:32", "but anyone in the outdoors could run", "29:34", "across some but hunters and anglers", "29:36", "especially because where do we go when", "29:38", "we're gonna find a good waterhole for", "29:40", "elk or you know we're hunting rock tail", "29:42", "we're gonna go you know we're not gonna", "29:44", "stay on the beaten path man we're gonna", "29:46", "go down to the headwaters we're gonna", "29:47", "find a pristine area we're going to get", "29:49", "away from people so all the people that", "29:51", "are going the deepest into the", "29:52", "backcountry absolutely absolutely and", "29:54", "then they're finding the water you know", "29:56", "source and they're maybe they're", "29:58", "following it and it's dry or it's", "30:00", "diverted like what I found in 2004 that", "30:01", "started this whole craziness and then", "30:04", "they run into a grow we also do find it", "30:07", "from the area you know we do all", "30:08", "agencies it's no no secret no no", "30:11", "tactical reveal we fly to look for this", "30:13", "stuff from the air I have a friend of", "30:15", "found one on Tejon ranch really yeah", "30:17", "yeah two years back and I didn't think", "30:20", "anything of it I thought it was just", "30:22", "some crazy person decided to try to grow", "30:24", "pot yes this back before was", "30:26", "recreationally legal okay and there was", "30:29", "no shootout or anything crazy like that", "30:30", "they got there after yeah either they", "30:34", "realized that their grow-op had been", "30:36", "compromised and they took off but you", "30:39", "know Tejon Ranch is enormous it's like", "30:40", "270,000 acres yeah and just the the gall", "30:44", "of these guys to go deep into that ranch", "30:46", "and set up this grow site right and the", "30:49", "guys who work there they I guess they", "30:51", "just stumbled upon it", "30:52", "I think they stumbled upon it because of", "30:54", "garbage - if I remember correctly yeah", "30:56", "that that follows track and the thing", "30:58", "now you're talking about a private", "31:00", "hunting ranch just got a cat Elise and", "31:01", "all that", "31:02", "huge we've done a lot of good stuff with", "31:04", "tyonne Ranch and supported you know good", "31:05", "hunting programs there but an", "31:08", "interesting statistic when I retired", "31:10", "last year in December in 2018", "31:12", "you know I mean we keep stats ever since", "31:14", "one of the cool things about the our", "31:15", "specialized team started in 2013 is we", "31:18", "solidified all the documentation to be", "31:20", "spot-on", "31:20", "you know reporting was kind of haphazard", "31:23", "throughout the state we weren't sure", "31:24", "what other agencies were doing but we", "31:25", "knew what we were doing now and so I'm", "31:27", "keeping that data and there was a real", "31:30", "shift in just public land presence

they've all been", "89:03", "around this particular problem we had a", "89:06", "lot less once the team got formalized", "89:08", "and so we started using dogs but we", "89:10", "still had two during the window of the", "89:12", "team being operational that we couldn't", "89:13", "avoid and dogs played a big part in that", "89:15", "as I go into many stories it's so great", "89:18", "I mean when I was listening to that", "89:19", "podcast with Steve Rinella the", "89:21", "meat-eater podcast with you and I was", "89:23", "like I can't believe that there's not", "89:25", "some sort of another

getting", "98:07", "them all and we know it's not going away", "98:08", "anytime soon it must have been very", "98:10", "interesting to talk to the cartel", "98:11", "members and have them say to you that", "98:13", "they know that you guys are taxed oh", "98:15", "yeah yeah shit yeah like they know they", "98:19", "know you know your operation they know", "98:21", "like how do they know they just they", "98:23", "look at the number and end I mean we get", "98:26", "so little information because they're so", "98:28", "my eyes for when you like you're talking", "98:30", "to them how many days do you get with", "98:32", "them we got an interview just you know", "98:34", "one this was one with DEA and a bunch of", "98:36", "other officials and multiple", "98:37", "interpreters and I get to sit

but a good one", "98:48", "and it was it from that one where she", "98:50", "saved that another gunfight from", "98:51", "happening but but the thing about it was", "98:53", "we don't get to talking very often when", "98:55", "we do it's it's very rare that they'll", "98:58", "talk they're put together in an", "99:00", "organization where they don't really", "99:02", "know last names they only

was someone that was", "99:19", "taken on other cartel crimes at high", "99:21", "level but not a violent guy you know he", "99:24", "was very candid and straightforward he's", "99:26", "responsible for a lot of", "99:27", "stuff in California and I can say that", "99:29", "much in other parts of the country but", "99:32", "what he revealed was just validating", "99:35", "what we knew but it gave it gave us", "99:37", "tools to progress and learn from that", "99:38", "yeah I was gonna say when they when you", "99:40", "do get that information from him", "99:42", "did that allow you to get more resources", "99:46", "or to like confirm like hey look this is", "99:48", "what we know we need to pull out all", "99:50", "this infrastructure we need to pull out", "99:51", "these pipes if we don't they're gonna", "99:53", "come back it is this is gonna make a", "99:55", "difference it did and when we when we", "99:57", "formed with the new team we said here's", "99:59", "how we're gonna approach this", "100:00", "we're gonna we're gonna help agencies", "100:01", "we're gonna do our own missions we're", "100:03", "gonna help other agencies that are doing", "100:04", "the work but we're gonna do it under the", "100:06", "caveat that we're going to do a three", "100:07", "prong approach we're gonna apprehend as", "100:10", "diligently as we can and catch these", "100:12", "guys through our dogs through our", "100:14", "tactics because you know just chasing", "100:16", "them around and know when they're going", "100:17", "to get away there's no deterrence in", "100:18", "that and yeah it's risky and yeah it's", "100:21", "dangerous but at least I know if I take", "100:23", "them into custody even for a day of five", "100:24", "days whatever maybe they're deported", "100:26", "maybe they're not that's one really", "100:27", "skilled guy doing a lot of environmental", "100:29", "damage that's at least out of", "100:30", "circulation for a while yeah right so", "100:32", "that had to happen we're gonna eradicate", "100:34", "every tainted plant and 90% of these", "100:37", "grows they're all tainted with this", "100:38", "carbo firends so they have any percent", "100:40", "90% it started 10 years ago is about one", "100:43", "out of two and by the time those stats", "100:46", "were trickling at the end of 2018 I was", "100:47", "compiling for the team I'm like oh my", "100:49", "gosh man we had carbo Furion and like 89", "100:52", "or 90 percent of every gross site we", "100:54", "went into on these trespass grows but", "100:58", "then the third thing we had to do and we", "101:01", "would only want to work with agencies", "101:03", "that agreed is reclamators gonna be", "101:06", "dirty guys we might have to come back a", "101:08", "different day but give us your", "101:10", "helicopter team give us some bodies yeah", "101:12", "and it's there's no specific reclamation", "101:15", "like group like it's like it seems we", "101:18", "should have an agency that does we don't", "101:20", "have that in place yet and this an", "101:22", "original Creek that you guys had in 2004", "101:25", "did you guys read divert the water we", "101:27", "did and so yes all we actually can't let", "101:29", "her flow on again yeah it took two years", "101:31", "to get the fish back on that one and", "101:33", "that was literally what numbers of fish", "101:35", "do you guys think you lost in that oh", "101:37", "man I mean the the steelhead are", "101:39", "federally listed right now in their", "101:40", "Valley", "101:41", "like 20 to $30,000 of fish yeah there's", "101:43", "a threat so catch and release of that I", "101:45", "wanted to ask you as a game warden you", "101:47", "know I'm not a fan", "101:48", "yeah of catching really you don't like", "101:50", "to catch or release well it's weird like", "101:53", "I like fishing for food right I mean", "101:56", "it's like I don't want to shoot a deer", "101:59", "with a blow dart either and just go look", "102:00", "I got 100 right and then let them like", "102:03", "wake up Jesus and get out of there no", "102:05", "I'm doing it for food yeah yeah I mean", "102:07", "look I know steelhead fishing is fun I", "102:09", "know it is it looks it looks awesome", "102:11", "I've never caught steelhead but I've", "102:12", "caught salmon of crown they're amazing", "102:14", "sure there was gorgeous fish but", "102:17", "catching them and shoving a hook in", "102:19", "their head and then letting them go just", "102:20", "seems stupid it's not yeah it's", "102:23", "counterintuitive you uh you don't eat", "102:25", "them at all steelhead at all well if", "102:27", "they're listed and they're so threatened", "102:28", "the way to keep steelhead fishing going", "102:30", "I know like in California is okay guys", "102:32", "you can catch them but you got a release", "102:34", "that's so stupid you know so but now", "102:36", "what about Oregon and Pacific", "102:38", "Northwest's they do they keep them there", "102:41", "in some places they do is just good", "102:43", "eating fish yeah yeah it's a rainbow", "102:45", "trout right yeah derivative yeah but", "102:47", "it's but it's spawning is coming from", "102:49", "the ocean it's going up a river its", "102:50", "spawning going back to the ocean so", "102:52", "that's what makes it a steelhead yeah", "102:53", "and it's an awesome fish this man can", "102:56", "fight like crazy and it's just they do", "102:58", "really natural they're tough yeah and", "103:02", "you just look at the you look at how", "103:04", "sensitive they are and in that one Creek", "103:06", "and the 2004 grow that was the worst", "103:08", "scenario that could have happened right", "103:10", "that they hit the headwaters of the", "103:12", "start of this spawning channel that went", "103:14", "to a creek called coyote creek that", "103:16", "actually went all the way into San Jose", "103:17", "to the South Bay of the ocean so that", "103:20", "pollution situation from those banned", "103:22", "poisons was just decimating you know", "103:24", "three to five miles of creeks so we had", "103:26", "to take that water away diversion out we", "103:28", "had to clean it all up", "103:30", "honey clean it up net it up bag all the", "103:33", "trash pull all the water lines you know", "103:35", "what about the pesticides how do you", "103:36", "clean that if it's if it's banned we got", "103:39", "to basically get a hazmat team to pull", "103:40", "it out you know we got to put it in", "103:42", "hazardous material buckets cap it real", "103:44", "carefully you know and then and then", "103:46", "just get it out safely what's the stuff", "103:47", "that gets into the ground you got to", "103:49", "move remove the soil you got to go", "103:50", "through it and we can't always do that", "103:52", "and something that's interesting and", "103:54", "we get into this especially in book 2 is", "103:56", "there's a group called ier C at a UC", "103:59", "Davis dr. Murad Gabriel and his", "104:02", "colleagues and they're going in as an", "104:04", "NGO and they're the scientists that", "104:06", "really validated the devastation these", "104:08", "these banned

that and that kind of came", "104:17", "to surface about five or six years ago", "104:19", "and then the kind of the light bulb went", "104:21", "off that hey this is an outside", "104:22",

out of the", "104:47", "creeks it's not going to be completely a", "104:48", "completely restored and sometimes that", "104:51", "can take you know we might have the", "104:53", "resources to get back in there for a", "104:54", "year or half a year we always try to get", "104:56", "it before the end of the year when the", "104:57", "rains come but it's not always possible", "105:00", "it just can't it can't happen and you", "105:01", "were saying that these pesticides", "105:02", "dissipate off the plant somewhat some", "105:06", "periods of time does that the case with", "105:07", "groundwater and in the ground as well", "105:10", "they dissipate toxicity somewhat", "105:12", "everywhere but they don't dissipate to", "105:14", "the point where they're not harmful on", "105:16", "some level so is a case in point I have", "105:20", "a slide I show on my PowerPoint that", "105:21", "actually came from IRC and we've seen", "105:23", "this multiple times if you know you have", "105:25", "a

just put a radioactive time bomb in", "106:01", "that animal I mean that's a hot carcass", "106:03", "and that was days after you know when", "106:04", "the scientists are coming back in so", "106:07", "dissipated or not it has its effects we", "106:10", "see that in California with rat poison", "106:13", "yes an eagle or any not Eagles as well", "106:16", "very much so yeah that's why getting all", "106:19", "those toxic sivan the ones that are", "106:21", "illegal out of areas were Al's or any", "106:23", "type of raptors or you know carrion", "106:25", "feeders nope you don't
