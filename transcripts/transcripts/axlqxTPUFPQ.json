many", "07:44", "people are are clinging to it as a", "07:47", "panacea I'm baffled by whether or not", "07:51", "it's a physiological effect or whether", "07:54", "there's a placebo effect going on I have", "07:56", "a theory", "07:56", "please yeah so my theory is that it", "07:59", "mimics some of the benefits of fasting", "08:02", "but allows people to persist for longer", "08:05", "because it's providing some nutrition", "08:07", "you know most if you look in the", "08:09", "scientific literature fasting is like", "08:12", "the cure-all for everything I agree I", "08:14", "mean like you can look at any condition", "08:16", "and fasting is the cure but time water", "08:18", "fasting so you can't do it for two three", "08:20", "four weeks the problem is try that for a", "08:22", "year that will be the cure for life in", "08:25", "that case the longest example is a year", "08:28", "of water fest so most people are lost", "08:32", "he was extremely obese fat stores", "08:37",

"08:46", "nothing - okay you know I don't", "08:47", "any evidence but when meat is absorbed", "08:50", "very high up in the digestive tract and", "08:52", "so when you only eat meat it's a low",

like a", "09:12", "gut rest or a fast and so I don't you", "09:16", "know the out that people are benefiting", "09:18", "from it the question is what is the", "09:20", "long-term implication yeah I mean I I'm", "09:23", "not anti Kido I'm not anti vegan I'm", "09:26", "anti bullshit and one of the problems we", "09:30", "have is nutrition is replacing religion", "09:32", "for a lot of people so you find", "09:35", "something that you identify with and", "09:37", "then people start to try to say because", "09:40", "they identify with that movement or like", "09:42", "for example vegans they identify with", "09:44", "many of them protection of animals not", "09:47", "my job to judge their ethics on that", "09:49", "sort of thing but then they kind of try", "09:51", "to backtrack to find the science to", "09:53", "support them as well and they pick and", "09:56", "choose and this is guilty of all groups", "09:57", "not just vegans this is also a lot of", "09:59", "ketogenic diet sell its carnivore diet", "10:02", "whatever have you if it has the word", "10:04", "diet they're zealots out there who are", "10:07", "going after it and I will stick up for", "10:09", "I've stuck up at a scientific conference", "10:12", "for the ketogenic diet you were we were", "10:14", "having a roundtable about something", "10:16", "different and somebody said well we know", "10:18", "that the ketogenic diet impairs exercise", "10:20", "performance and endurance athletes and I", "10:22", "said I don't think that's necessarily", "10:23", "true you know the the it's pretty", "10:26", "ambivalent they are ambiguous as to", "10:29", "whether or not it does it seems to be", "10:31", "kind of individual but on the whole on", "10:33", "the average it doesn't seem to impair", "10:34", "exercise performance so it's kind of", "10:36", "what you like but when you have people", "10:38", "who you know like like a Gary Taubes who", "10:41", "says well calories don't matter it's all", "10:43", "carbohydrates that sort of thing on the", "10:46", "carbohydrate insulin model obesity I", "10:48", "mean the research is you're able to do a", "10:51", "lot of hand waving about insulin and you", "10:54", "know will you burn so much fat when", "10:55", "you're on a high-fat diet which is true", "10:57", "by the way you you burn a lot of fat but", "10:59", "what they don't talk about is that it's", "11:01", "it's overall fat balanced how much fat", "11:04", "you store versus how much fat you burn", "11:06", "and when you're on a high-fat diet you", "11:08", "store a lot of fat you also burn a lot", "11:10", "of fat the overall caloric balance is", "11:12", "what determines whether or not you will", "11:14", "have net storage or net deposition it's", "11:17", "the same thing for high carb diet as", "11:18", "well you know this idea that with high", "11:21", "insulin it just completely shuts down", "11:23", "all fat burning everywhere that's just", "11:25", "not true now if you have high", "11:27", "carbohydrate you will burn less fat but", "11:28", "you're also storing less fat as well and", "11:31", "again the net caloric balance is going", "11:34", "to be what determines how much you store", "11:36", "because you don't really store", "11:38", "carbohydrate as fat for most people they", "11:41", "did a study overfeeding women where they", "11:44", "overfed them 50 percent above their", "11:46", "caloric maintenance and they found that", "11:47", "of 282 grams of fat they stored during a", "11:50", "day in adipose only four grams came from", "11:53",
