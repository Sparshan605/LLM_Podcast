a", "13:04", "beach in Jamaica and there was no wind", "13:07", "and you just start getting sweat and", "13:09", "you're just uncomfortable but then if", "13:11", "trade winds went through it would have", "13:13", "at the same temperature to evaporate the", "13:15", "water off your skin so what we're trying", "13:17", "to do is", "13:19", "we're trying to at the right ratio", "13:21", "evaporate the water off the surface so", "13:24", "it doesn't get like a smelly stinky bad", "13:27", "mold and dehydrated slowly what it does", "13:32", "is it concentrates the flavor it", "13:34", "transforms the amino acids into a whole", "13:36", "different compound and changes the", "13:38", "flavor altogether and then also enzymes", "13:40", "within the meat through the process of", "13:42", "rigor mortis it breaks down so it", "13:45", "becomes more tender so you get flavor", "13:47", "enhancement you get tenderization and it", "13:50", "just it just blows it away so what does", "13:52", "it do to the amino acids it transforms", "13:55", "it into a whole nother compound it's", "13:57", "like a flavor it's it's like when we", "13:59", "talk have you ever heard of like concept", "14:00", "of like my gut reaction yes but I don't", "14:03", "know what it means anymore a really", "14:05", "expression but I forgot what I mean yeah", "14:06", "the my reaction is basically like when", "14:08", "you're cooking something when ends a", "14:10", "pass pellet is it mylar no ma I ll Aard", "14:17", "right my lord oh my lord", "14:19", "okay I said my art okay that's what I", "14:21", "know is so you know when your ever your", "14:25", "browning are you're doing different", "14:26", "things at different rates amino acids", "14:28", "transform into different things and you", "14:30", "get different flavor compounds and", "14:31", "that's really what happens you know with", "14:33", "meat you know so if I dry-aged you have", "14:35", "to handle dry aged meat a lot", "14:37", "differently you can't go on it's like", "14:38", "okay I'm gonna slow cook this one says", "14:40", "triage because it just it develops a", "14:43", "really nasty kind of like funky flavor", "14:47", "but if you cook it under high heat like", "14:49", "really aggressive like that's why you", "14:50", "have Steakhouse broilers there's", "14:52", "something about that browning of that", "14:54",

cooking past medium", "15:12", "it's almost like you know seeing someone", "15:18", "like transform like it just ages like", "15:21", "when you cook it a long time it just", "15:23", "ages and just turns into something else", "15:24", "is this one well-done steak are", "15:27", "offensive you should go and eat burger", "15:29", "can you monsters", "15:32", "what's wrong with you when I hear when

it's a bit less", "16:37", "but it's not necessarily the temperature", "16:39", "it's kind of like how you get there okay", "16:41", "let me explain that to you so okay I", "16:43", "have this method where particularly for", "16:45", "thicker steaks where I'll cook it I", "16:49", "start the cooking and then I get it to", "16:51", "about 105 degrees and then I allow it to", "16:55", "rest at 105 and when it's up happening", "16:58", "is is I call them at that just like", "16:59", "tempering of the meat and it basically", "17:02", "it starts transmitting the temperature", "17:05", "in towards the center and then I put it", "17:07", "back in again", "17:08", "and then it will ill heat up the", "17:12", "temperature if you like take it I would", "17:14", "say from medium-rare even though like on", "17:16", "many logs will say okay 120 125 is rare", "17:20", "but it's not you know for me if you're", "17:22", "gonna do that method a solid medium-rare", "17:25", "will be about 120 really yeah so why do", "17:29", "they think 120 is rare I don't really", "17:32", "understand that exactly you know they'll", "17:33", "get there I think they're overshooting", "17:35", "it particularly for me it's not rare", "17:37", "like rare is is is 110 using the method", "17:42", "that I use now different people have", "17:45", "different methods", "17:45", "which is really what's fascinating

long", "18:09", "that's their cooking all over fire and", "18:11", "they have these grates these grill", "18:13", "grates that rise and lower and you know", "18:17", "you could see how they're doing it when", "18:19", "you walk in the door guys you're walking", "18:20", "to your table you're passing by yeah and", "18:23", "this method of this idea of cooking over", "18:27", "logs like cooking over fire some people", "18:30", "prefer that and then some people like", "18:33", "those crazy broilers where their gas but", "18:37", "the broiler it's on top yes it's ready", "18:39", "can and it's lowering down exactly what", "18:41", "is the is there a difference and why it", "18:44", "really comes down to what your taste", "18:47", "preference is okay for me like where I'm", "18:50", "at right now dry aged without any type", "18:52", "of smoker wood is more preferable", "18:54", "because I really want to taste the dry", "18:56", "aged when you start getting into the", "18:57", "wood fire cooking and your burning logs", "19:01", "that aren't burnt out I like to cook", "19:03", "basically my wood down to charcoal like", "19:06", "to ash so that it's cleaner okay so then", "19:09", "you really taste the meat when you start", "19:11", "you know burning on unburnt fuel", "19:14", "you know belongs themselves it has like", "19:16", "these creosote and different flavor", "19:18",

"19:34", "do that in your home with the cast iron", "19:36", "okay so it's called a plunge plancha you", "19:38", "know it's just kind of like this flat", "19:40", "sheet of Steel mm-hmm and it's all about", "19:44", "crust development and surface contacts", "19:46", "so like I like to cut the steaks on a", "19:48", "saw so it's a perfect line and it's all", "19:51", "about contact direct with the surface", "19:53", "it's about the Browning of the meat you", "19:55", "know if you're going to get in there and", "19:57", "you're gonna cook over", "19:58", "live would like that he's doing it", "20:01", "obviously right because he's amazing but", "20:02", "you know when you raise and lower the", "20:05", "shelf like I was saying how I arrest it", "20:07", "like you can start on the higher higher", "20:09", "level of the heat and then you bring it", "20:12", "up higher the actual grill higher and", "20:14", "it's actually resting while still", "20:16", "getting like the tickle of of heat up", "20:18", "there the tickle of heat yeah so I", "20:21", "imagine it like so", "20:22", "the flames won't actually touch the meat", "20:25", "it kind of tickles it so it's kind of", "20:28", "like it kind of wisps at the bottom of", "20:29", "the meat and so the way he's doing it at", "20:31", "bizarre meats he's using wet aged steaks", "20:34", "because that's how you would cook over", "20:36", "over that kind of I don't know if he's", "20:39", "doing it that's my personal preference I", "20:41", "mean I just do some aging it does do", "20:43", "some aging I believe over there so but", "20:46", "it's it's just I've watched youtube", "20:48", "videos and how to cook the perfect steak", "20:49", "you can watch three different videos in", "20:51", "three different chefs and there's three", "20:53", "different methods you know like well the", "20:55", "thing about dry aging though I mean all", "20:57", "dry aging is not created equal I call an", "20:58", "environmental chamber so think about it", "21:00", "like making cheese in France you say hey", "21:02", "i order goat cheese and you think you'd", "21:04", "get one type of goat cheese across the", "21:06", "line I'm creating an environment just", "21:07", "like a cheese maker", "21:08", "okay that's unique to my own I actually", "21:11", "have the culture from 1516 years ago", "21:14", "that I've traveled with put hold on you", "21:18", "put culture so yeah I've like a method I", "21:21", "basically take meat that has been aged", "21:24", "and I bring those spores if you will", "21:27", "from that aging meat because you know", "21:29", "there's a mold on it it's a friendly", "21:30", "mold and it's a friendly roll yeah I", "21:33", "like it I don't know I don't want to", "21:36", "like you know turn people off to it", "21:38", "because this is but I didn't know that", "21:39", "you brought your own mold yeah so I just", "21:42", "figured you just let it dry aged it's", "21:44", "not as it's not as simple as that for me", "21:47", "like it's each environment again so I", "21:49", "get away from like someone can turn", "21:51", "around and say like my dry aged is", "21:53", "incredibly clean at a hundred hundred", "21:55", "days 120 days because I get there slowly", "21:59", "my temperatures very low I like to you", "22:02", "know try age of 32 to 35 degrees I like", "22:05", "a high humidity so I don't dehydrate the", "22:08", "meat too soon I like 85% so", "22:10", "times a little bit lower if I want to", "22:12", "pull it really depends you know so when", "22:14", "you sit a fan's so when you say the cult", "22:16", "like how are you bringing this culture", "22:18", "and how do you get it to interact with", "22:19", "me I basically take I take pieces from", "22:23", "the previous you know dry-aged room and", "22:26", "I bring it to that and so I put it up by", "22:29", "the fan and it will circulate spores you", "22:31", "put it by the fan like how do you do it", "22:33", "what is a fan in in in a cooler and it's", "22:37", "blowing around it's like blowing the so", "22:39", "will blow the the spores around the room", "22:42", "so my dry-aged has a unique flavor in my", "22:45", "try you know some great guys who like", "22:48", "mass purveyors and the Bronx which is", "22:50", "these guys like my heroes you know", "22:51", "they taught me practically dry-aging", "22:53", "they have their own flavor so they're", "22:56", "dry aged tastes different you know Pat", "22:57", "LaFrieda is another New York guy does", "22:59", "amazing dry aged beef as well you know", "23:02", "his has a different flavor so you know", "23:04", "for me that's why I take a lot of pride", "23:06", "even though it's not the most", "23:06", "cost-effective thing to carry you know a", "23:08", "hundred thousand dollars in inventory", "23:10", "but it gives me unique flavor profile", "23:13", "that is my unique selling point for my", "23:16", "restaurant so you have these pieces so", "23:19", "like those steaks that we saw in that", "23:21", "photograph you take one of those", "23:23", "dry-aged steaks when it's ready and then", "23:25", "you would trim the pieces off then you", "23:27", "use those pieces those darkened pieces", "23:30", "it just has the spores on it and that", "23:32", "would how do you know how much to put in", "23:33", "there up in as much as I can you know", "23:36", "I'm really I don't want it to like clean", "23:38", "clean and there I want it to be an", "23:40", "environment so it's like a cave and you", "23:44", "know I'll put a couple of trays in and", "23:46", "then I'm I'm very tactile so I'll touch", "23:48", "the meat and I'll feel it and you know", "23:51", "I'll taste it I'll see where we're at", "23:52", "I'm always cutting into a steak it's", "23:54", "like a lot like you say you taste it you", "23:56", "cook it", "23:56", "yeah like I'll cut off a piece like how", "23:58", "are we looking at 30 days how we looking", "24:00", "at 50 days so each room is different", "24:02", "because you know I had tried room in", "24:06", "Vegas and we had you know ceilings that", "24:08", "were 3035 feet a lot of circulating air", "24:12", "it was just it was just like had a", "24:14", "different flavor profile we were able to", "24:16", "age 150 days and that was like our sweet", "24:20", "spot okay and then here in in Hollywood", "24:23", "it's a lot less of a lower ceiling it", "24:26", "circulates differently it's just you", "24:28", "have to really kind of taste it's not", "24:30", "just like hey I've dry aged or you go to", "24:32", "the supermarket it's like oh you sell", "24:33", "dry aged okay great I'll take it and if", "24:36", "you think that's what it tastes like", "24:37", "it's a good indicator of what it is but", "24:40", "if you really want to get you know like", "24:42", "down to it you know each triage can", "24:45", "taste a lot different that's so that's", "24:48", "really weird so it's it's very", "24:52", "experimental in a lot of ways it's", "24:54", "constantly moving I wanted to take you", "24:55", "to dial it in well when I first did it", "24:59", "it was really by mistake particularly", "25:01", "the extended age because you just", "25:02", "weren't selling the meat so I had a", "25:04", "couple of Peet a lot of pieces like like", "25:06", "left you know back for a long time and", "25:09", "you know I was like I take the cut into", "25:13", "when I taste this like whoa I mean this", "25:15", "is incredible and I was talking to the", "25:16", "old school guys who drives like oh", "25:18", "you're wasting your money", "25:19", "nobody wants steak over 42 days you know", "25:22", "it's just eat hydrating.what I think no", "25:24", "I think I'm onto something you know", "25:26", "there's there's a big difference here in", "25:28", "the flavor and as you know we would see", "25:30", "like a huge difference to jump into", "25:33", "flavor and like good quality not like", "25:35", "the funky stuff like the the full year", "25:37", "that like that's another level that's", "25:39", "very good you say funky and I want to", "25:42", "say I just want to clarify to people it", "25:43", "is delicious it is delicious but it's", "25:45", "unusual it's like you're eating", "25:47", "something from Africa you see some", "25:49", "unusual kudu meters in some strange game", "25:52", "yeah it's got you only want to you don't", "25:54", "want to eat too much like people want", "25:55", "like a whole steak I'm like no you just", "25:57", "want to slices of it", "25:58", "savor it like a fine wine understand", "26:01", "that get to know it but don't like", "26:03", "hunker down on it how come you don't", "26:05", "want people to hunker down on it because", "26:07", "sometimes too much of a good thing is", "26:09", "not good okay and I say the same thing", "26:12", "also for the Japanese Wagyu like oh you", "26:14", "see all that fat in the marbleization", "26:16", "it's incredibly rich and if you eat it", "26:19", "like a westerner it's not right it's", "26:21", "just it's too much so certain steaks", "26:25", "certain types of beef you should be", "26:27", "eating only a small amount and", "26:29", "appreciating anything more like you just", "26:31", "it's just I don't know it gets me it's", "26:35", "it's too much", "26:35", "for me when did people start dry-aging a", "26:38", "year like when when did this really", "26:40", "because this is not something I mean", "26:42", "obviously I'd know nothing about", "26:43", "restaurants yeah", "26:44", "other than they're great yeah but when I", "26:49", "had heard about dry-aging out here", "26:51", "thirty days dry aged six days dry aged I", "26:54", "never heard of a year like is this a new", "26:56", "thing um you know they were doing it in", "27:00", "Spain for some time particularly with", "27:01", "the older animals like the oxen you know", "27:04", "animals that are five years eight years", "27:07", "ten years old and they would age these", "27:09", "for long periods of time I was not aware", "27:11", "of this when I started doing it but they", "27:13", "were the first people but I heard about", "27:15", "it was doing it while I was doing it", "27:17", "there was amazing a food writer Jeffrey", "27:19", "Steingarten who just like dialed in to", "27:22", "me and we did a tasting with one of my", "27:25", "culinary heros Harold McGee who wrote", "27:28", "the incredible book on food and cooking", "27:30", "which is a scientific manual to all", "27:32", "chefs around", "27:32", "it's amazing guy and he had put in his", "27:36", "book that there's really no difference", "27:38", "in flavor when you get to that that", "27:41", "point and so that later stage so we cook", "27:44", "three steaks and we cut a cube out of", "27:46", "the center of it and at that point you", "27:48", "know he says wait maybe there is", "27:49", "something different I'm not sure I mean", "27:52", "nowadays you hear more about it because", "27:55", "we're chefs we like to play with things", "27:57", "we like to push the limits on things but", "28:00", "not many people want to make the", "28:03", "commitment because it's so costly to", "28:04", "carry the inventory and they're scared", "28:06", "to actually do it because if you screw", "28:08", "it up you know you lose all the money so", "28:11", "I see more of it now but back when I was", "28:15", "doing it there really wasn't anybody", "28:17", "else pushing the limits maybe a few", "28:20", "people I don't want to say like I was", "28:21", "the only one but you know possibly that", "28:24", "could have been a few people but you", "28:26", "know so it's what's what's interesting", "28:31", "to me about just cuisine and cooking in", "28:35", "general is that I didn't think of it", "28:38", "until I watched Bourdain's original show", "28:41", "no reservations I didn't think of it as", "28:42", "an art form and then when I watched the", "28:45", "show I was like interested into cooking", "28:47", "this guy is that's one of the things", "28:48", "about", "28:49", "people being really passionate about", "28:53", "something I think it's an incredibly", "28:55", "contagious and his passion for cooking", "28:58", "and his fascination with different", "29:02", "methods these masters would use and the", "29:05", "way he would just just you could see it", "29:07", "like he was he was so focused on it and", "29:11", "so enthralled by these flavors and these", "29:16", "creations of these chefs would make that", "29:18", "I realized like oh this is an art form", "29:20", "it's just an art form that you eat but I", "29:23", "never thought of it that way", "29:25", "I just thought oh that place has", "29:26", "delicious food this place tastes good", "29:29", "and then you go to a really fine", "29:31", "restaurant or a fine steakhouse like", "29:33", "your place and you go oh these people", "29:36", "are mad they're artists they're artists", "29:39", "it bounces between art and craft you", "29:42", "know it's like there's there's a moment", "29:44", "in time when as chefs we explore it as", "29:48", "art you know because you know you're not", "29:50", "going in with any boundaries and you're", "29:52", "not going in and preconceived notions of", "29:54", "what it should be and that's when", "29:55", "cooking is a true art most of the time", "29:58", "we're we're doing the the craft part", "30:01", "where we figured it out and then there's", "30:03", "a regiment of like lining it up to make", "30:06", "sure it's consistent and we pride", "30:09", "ourselves and basically that consistency", "30:11", "and team gathering around and doing", "30:13", "something Universal together but the art", "30:15", "form for me is and maintaining just", "30:18", "being curious and inquisitive has just", "30:19", "been my bug from the day I decided to be", "30:22", "a chef and for many people like Bourdain", "30:24", "and every other chef that I know of it", "30:27", "that's that's the key that you know that", "30:29", "you'll never learn everything you know", "30:31", "but you know you keep trying those", "30:33", "there's like a sea of information that", "30:35", "you know that's out there to explore", "30:37", "yeah he would take you on these journeys", "30:40", "to these like very strange restaurants", "30:42", "in France where you know they're on the", "30:44", "side of a lake and there's like ten", "30:46", "customers and a hundred chefs working", "30:49", "and they're creating these things like", "30:51", "with filet knives and a grape and like", "30:53", "two or three caviar eggs and then they", "30:56", "give it to these people in there and ex2", "30:58", "seemed like what this is so different I", "31:00", "almost felt embarrassed", "31:03", "when I first started talking to him", "31:04", "about this like like I it's is it you", "31:07", "know what it's like it's like for me", "31:08", "like I've been a lifelong martial artist", "31:11", "and I went when some people believe", "31:14", "ridiculous things about martial arts and", "31:16", "then you have to kind of well that's not", "31:17", "really how it works you have to kind of", "31:19", "explain to them and then they see it", "31:20", "from my perspective no like oh you've", "31:22", "been doing this your whole life this is", "31:24", "something you're deeply invested in and", "31:27", "you're very passionate about you care", "31:28", "very deeply about the the true nature of", "31:31", "what martial arts are well that's how", "31:34", "cooking is to chefs it's they're all", "31:37", "very similar I know people don't like to", "31:39", "think of martial arts as it's a great", "31:41", "analogy but they don't like to think of", "31:43", "it as an art form because it hurts", "31:44", "people because it's violent and violence", "31:47", "is bad right but it is an art form it's", "31:49", "just a strange one that it's beautiful", "31:52", "to the people that appreciate it that", "31:54", "understand how difficult it is to pull", "31:56", "something off and how what this", "31:58", "incredible dance between these people is", "32:01", "but on the outside like an ignorant", "32:04", "person or a person with a very", "32:06", "narrow-minded perspective would say oh", "32:08", "that's not an art that's violence that's", "32:11", "terribly was it Meryl Streep that said", "32:13", "that wasn't it during what yeah it was", "32:16", "it was like and you know martial arts", "32:19", "are not the arts like okay lady", "32:22", "it's but people have their preconceived", "32:26", "notions and I had an embarrassing", "32:27", "preconceived notion about food and I say", "32:31", "embarrassing great analogy by the way it", "32:33", "is in many ways and in comedy sommore in", "32:37", "that sense as well because people look", "32:39", "at comedy like oh they're just telling", "32:40", "jokes yes yes they are telling jokes but", "32:45", "the process is so labor-intensive", "32:49", "there's so much going on and it's I", "32:51", "think it's like everything so many", "32:53", "things you look at them from the outside", "32:55", "whether it's carpentry or sculpture you", "32:57", "look at it from the outside and if you", "32:59", "have no experience in it people can", "33:01", "dismiss it and they don't think of it as", "33:03", "this passionate art form but now I have", "33:07", "a completely different I mean I became", "33:09", "good friends with Bourdain and you know", "33:11", "I did a show and hung out with them a", "33:13", "bunch times and", "33:15", "I got it then I'm like okay this is a", "33:18", "different thing than I had this this", "33:21", "idea this narrow-minded idea of what", "33:22", "food is and then you get to meet other", "33:24", "chefs and you meet all these people and", "33:26", "you're like these are these like sort of", "33:27", "underappreciated artists that are also", "33:29", "feeding people he had that ability he", "33:32", "had that ability to bridge the gap and", "33:33", "and to help people understand he", "33:35", "schooled me once and trying to", "33:37", "understand Japanese cuisine yeah you're", "33:39", "telling me about that yeah tell me about", "33:41", "what was that like well I was just I was", "33:43", "sitting there we around the table I was", "33:44", "there him and Emeril it was it was it", "33:47", "was after an event down in South Beach", "33:49", "food and wine and we're all as cooks do", "33:53", "all at the end of an event you know", "33:56", "we're sitting around it were just kind", "33:57", "of reminiscing on things happening and", "33:58", "he was there sitting next to him and", "34:01", "someone brought up the concept of you", "34:03", "know Japanese cuisine and I just said", "34:06", "yeah you know it's it's so simple and he", "34:10", "just says yes but it's so complex and", "34:13", "then I just took a step back and he just", "34:15", "began to really school me on it and he", "34:18", "just had the ability just to really", "34:20", "communicate food and connection to", "34:23", "community and culture and and that for", "34:28", "me was was a big moment like I just got", "34:30", "to really see him as that person", "34:31", "directly I didn't think that sushi was", "34:35", "very complex at all the Japanese food", "34:38", "until I watched jiro Dreams of Sushi al", "34:40", "that's it you

does it that", "54:19", "way but I think the best thing that you", "54:21", "can say is that you know you know I like", "54:24", "I think about as like hey you have a", "54:25", "golf bag and you have all these", "54:26", "different irons and woods and all these", "54:28", "different things in there it's like what", "54:30", "you know the circumstance the", "54:32", "environment it's gonna dictate how you", "54:34", "cook not say hey I'm gonna cook that", "54:36", "steak and I'm gonna use the cast-iron", "54:38", "pans like well I don't have a cast-iron", "54:39", "pan so what you can do is like well I'm", "54:41", "gonna cook my grills like you don't have", "54:43", "a grill just say okay what do I have", "54:47", "it's like you have this this and this", "54:48", "that's you know so I only have this", "54:50", "shitty you know steel pan here and doing", "54:54", "like this and you know you take a look", "54:56", "at it and you know like you adapt you", "54:58", "know I guess that this is a she'll is", "55:00", "steel pan shitty no no it's great", "55:02", "okay it's that like I'm just saying like", "55:04", "the steel pans are great blue steel you", "55:06", "know I use that all the time in the", "55:08", "kitchen you know I like cast-iron just", "55:11", "in terms of the the heat recovery that", "55:14", "it has what does that mean when you have", "55:16", "a cast-iron pan so you you heat it's", "55:19", "like it's slow to heat up but then once", "55:22", "it gets that level if I was", "55:24", "like a cold stake in it the cold stake", "55:26", "on a different type of pen would bring", "55:29", "the temperature of the steel down and", "55:30", "then it has to heat back up and then by", "55:33", "that time water can start to develop", "55:35", "like underneath the steak and then it", "55:37", "starts boiling or steaming and that's", "55:39", "why you can't get a crust when you put", "55:41", "in a steak into a cast-iron pan for", "55:43", "example and you do app launch or", "55:45", "whatever the rate the rate at which", "55:47", "water is repelled is it basically it", "55:50", "steams or it goes away from the meat", "55:52", "it's actually and so as a result it then", "55:54", "starts the Browning okay and", "55:57", "transforming the flavor rather than it", "56:00", "boiling because if you taste it a boiled", "56:01", "piece of meat versus a piece of meat", "56:05", "with the crust you'd say the piece of", "56:06", "meat with the crust is a lot better you", "56:08", "know so there's just something about it", "56:10", "so the cast-iron pan is basically when", "56:14", "you put the steak in the temperatures", "56:16", "it's not even gonna be moved because", "56:18", "that's it's like a freight train it's", "56:19", "just moving you know it's gonna keep", "56:21", "going but something like a thinner steel", "56:23", "pan if you put something big and cold", "56:25", "into it it's gonna drop the temperature", "56:27", "of the steel and then it has to recover", "56:29", "not only with the steel but the mass of", "56:31", "let's say a thick steak so it's got to", "56:33", "compensate that's really what now I have", "56:37", "a carbon steel pan that I sear steaks on", "56:39", "all the time most of the time the way I", "56:41", "cook is I use a Trager grill and I cook", "56:45", "it very slow so I'll do it at 225", "56:48", "degrees and I'd do it until I hit an", "56:51", "internal temperature about 125 and then", "56:54", "I sear the outside that's been the", "56:55", "method that I use well I'm gonna just", "56:58", "share my knowledge with you so I you", "57:00", "know with cooking steaks the term sear", "57:03", "doesn't really it's it's a misnomer", "57:05", "there's only browning because like", "57:07", "searing really only can happen when you", "57:10", "know you have live flesh so to speak so", "57:11", "it doesn't actually happen like where it", "57:13", "Sears in or seals in juices what about", "57:16", "like ahi tuna when they sear that well", "57:18", "it's more like more like browning I mean", "57:22", "I'm just it's just like it's a terminal", "57:24", "it's a terminology it's like keep", "57:26", "searing I'm not not telling you not the", "57:27", "thing the concept is this it's browning", "57:30", "it's not searing so", "57:33", "bring me back on track low temperature", "57:36", "okay so for example what I would tweak", "57:38", "with you is like I would say go to 265", "57:41", "you can have the same results in a", "57:43", "quicker period of time with the same", "57:45", "tenderness that ratio of speed is not", "57:48", "going to impact your products so at the", "57:51", "end of the day 225 is everybody says", "57:53", "slow and low but I'd say a lot of times", "57:56", "like a bit hotter and a bit quicker is", "57:58", "actually better for the crust", "57:59", "development and also for the meat", "58:01", "because for the tenderness of the meat", "58:03", "let's say you have a thick like like a", "58:05", "brisket and it's got all these all this", "58:08", "collagen in it which is tightly wound", "58:10", "protein I think about it as like a", "58:12", "sponge that's dehydrated when you throw", "58:14", "it on top of the water it kind of floats", "58:16", "and then all the senate catches and then", "58:18", "soaks up the juice so when you're", "58:20", "putting it in at that lower temperature", "58:22", "you're heating it up you're causing the", "58:24", "protein to squeeze out the liquid and", "58:26", "then if you're doing at the rate ratio", "58:28", "it's drinking the liquid into the", "58:31", "collagen to turn into gelatin which is", "58:33", "that anxious beautiful mouthfeel that", "58:36", "you'll get from a long cooked piece of", "58:38", "meat okay now if you get a longer piece", "58:40", "of meat like a really well-done brisket", "58:43", "what temperature you cooking that", "58:45", "depending on the cooker that I'm using", "58:47", "but 265 is my is my typical dial in so", "58:51", "265 you don't you ever go lower than", "58:53", "that for anything I can if I want to get", "58:56", "sleep it's depending on my schedule", "58:58", "in other words like I'm gonna get", "59:00", "relatively the same results but less", "59:02", "crust development from 225 depending on", "59:05", "how I handle it again there's like a", "59:06", "lots of little variables so but by 265", "59:10", "I've found that for brisket for example", "59:12", "it's the right ratio of that college and", "59:15", "drinking it up to get the gelatin and", "59:17", "also the right crust development a lot", "59:20", "of what I cook is wildgame most of it so", "59:23", "which is a lot leaner and and so that's", "59:26", "why I would go a little bit hotter I'm", "59:28", "tried the next time you got nothin till", "59:30", "65 go to 65 okay and then how do you", "59:33", "feel about that method of cooking it", "59:35", "slowly then browning the outside later I", "59:37", "don't I'm not a big fan of it because", "59:39", "you know there's all these different", "59:41", "compounds that are full you know it's", "59:43", "not like I mean they call it like a", "59:44", "reverse here yeah it's", "59:46", "the terminology right for me there's", "59:48", "nothing like a crust that is created", "59:51", "because what ends up happening is it's", "59:53", "like you know if you're cooking it slow", "59:54", "all these juices start getting pulled", "59:56", "out okay and they disappear that like", "59:59", "their juice on the bag and make it into", "60:01", "a sauce or it gets evaporated into the", "60:02", "air the thing about doing that is is", "60:05", "like if you're putting it directly in", "60:06", "the pan while it's wet all those juices", "60:09", "are bouncing back and then read hearing", "60:11", "to the meat okay that's flavor that's", "60:13", "flavor you you would lose normally night", "60:15", "the sacrifices like Shore you'll get it", "60:18", "cooked from end to end perfect okay so", "60:20", "be pink - pink okay it's great right but", "60:23", "if you go back in you know sear it or", "60:27", "brown it after you miss out on all these", "60:29", "compounds and it's not the same crust I", "60:32", "bet you if I gave you a blind taste test", "60:35", "using the both methods you would", "60:37", "appreciate the other crust over the", "60:39", "reverse here and this is even with wild", "60:41", "game even with a very lean meat that's a", "60:43", "different story that's what I cooked", "60:44", "though okay that's a different story so", "60:47", "with the lean meat I would probably say", "60:53", "to brown it first and then go slow the", "60:55", "reverse because there is a gentle there", "60:57", "is a gentle way of of like it's so lean", "61:01", "you want to kind of like slide into home", "61:03", "I kind of say is like you develop a", "61:04", "certain amount of mint momentum and for", "61:07", "the leaner meats it's about the rest so", "61:10", "you're cooking it and then you're taking", "61:11", "it out and then you're allowing that", "61:13", "heat momentum to kind of carry over now", "61:15", "I gave you a bunch of elk meat how did", "61:17", "you cook it um a lot of it just like hot", "61:20", "and fast so I can really taste it you", "61:22", "know I don't mind a bit of a chew", "61:23", "most people are different you know for", "61:25", "me I want to taste the meat I want to", "61:27", "savor like the juices of what that is", "61:30", "and Elks my favorite thank you for that", "61:32", "I mean I'm still I still have some of it", "61:34", "it's fantastic I got more more oh I'll", "61:36", "take it down all right it's the best", "61:39", "well I want to try some of the way you", "61:41", "cook it I want I want to have you cook", "61:43", "some of that elk I'd love to yeah we got", "61:46", "to make that happen Wednesday's I would", "61:47", "love to see your method and what the", "61:49", "difference is I learned how to do it", "61:51", "from Chad Ward he's a world champion", "61:53", "barbecue guy whiskey bent barbecue on", "61:56", "Instagram", "61:57", "whiskey is it BB q whiskey bent bvq I", "62:00", "think Chad's great guy and I've been", "62:03", "with him in camp on several hunting", "62:05", "trips where he's cooked for Trager like", "62:08", "Trager will hire him to come and cook", "62:10", "for us and it's incredible and this", "62:13", "that's the method method that I learned", "62:15", "from him is that that reverse your", "62:17", "method it's incredible I mean you can go", "62:20", "to all different chefs and don't get to", "62:22", "the same place taking different paths", "62:24", "and they'll get there for me it's like", "62:26", "fishing you know it's like which fly", "62:27", "like you know which fly do you choose", "62:29", "like fine you know whatever the hatches", "62:31", "but it's often times it's the fly that", "62:34", "you believe in most that is gonna catch", "62:36", "the fish I mean okay I'm drawing a", "62:38", "terrible analogy here I know you're", "62:39", "saying confidence you're gonna fish it", "62:43", "harder you're gonna believe in it and", "62:44", "you know you embrace it and a lot of", "62:46", "that has to do with success in cooking", "62:49", "you know you have to believe in what", "62:51", "you're doing there's some obviously", "62:53", "there's some metrics involved but a", "62:54", "master like that guy for example", "62:57", "um I can't refute at the end of the day", "62:59", "it's fantastic I get there a different", "63:01", "way you know maybe there's subtle", "63:02", "differences maybe mine's better maybe", "63:04", "it's not I don't even think better", "63:06", "that's right but it is exactly they're", "63:08", "they're different and what would what do", "63:10", "you prefer and what do you how you feel", "63:11", "about Suvi I think it has its place but", "63:14", "it's not the answer you know for me um", "63:17", "you know certain types of proteins like", "63:19", "shellfish it's it's a godsend", "63:22", "shellfish yes what lobster tails or", "63:24", "shrimp or anything like that because the", "63:27", "protein there it's so delicate and if", "63:29", "you can go slow like Thomas Keller has a", "63:31", "fantastic recipe butter poaching lobster", "63:33", "tails in sous-vide and it just cooks it", "63:36", "so that it's super tender and it's not", "63:39", "tough and then obviously with vacuum", "63:41", "seal it with the butter of the butter", "63:42", "and some aromatics they take it out you", "63:47", "can kind of like toast it on the grill", "63:49", "lightly yeah my friend Forrest go", "63:56", "Forrest Galante he's a biologist and he", "63:59", "goes off of Santa Barbara and goes out", "64:03", "there and and and catches him and he", "64:05", "gave me so you've never done it with the", "64:07", "butter and no no never done its movie", "64:09", "I'm going", "64:10", "Changez I've only done it on a grill", "64:12", "I've only done it when it was delicious", "64:14", "I cooked he gave me four lobster tails", "64:16", "that he captured himself yeah they were", "64:19", "delicious but I cooked him on a grill I", "64:20", "just followed a recipe that I found and", "64:23", "with butter and paprika and a couple", "64:25", "different things yeah next time put that", "64:27", "in the bag seal it I'll follow the time", "64:29", "sequence take it out and then kiss it on", "64:31", "the grill you're gonna so what other", "64:33", "shellfish is good is scallops good he's", "64:36", "got me good good with with sous-vide but", "64:39", "you know for me scallops I mean", "64:40", "particularly if they're fresh I mean I'd", "64:42", "rather kind of just cook them in a pan", "64:45", "um there's something about that", "64:47", "particular the cell structure and the", "64:49", "scallop that I want just you know", "64:51", "charred in a pan and still just like", "64:54", "almost like a bit raw there's a sweet", "64:56", "spot with scallops yeah there's such a", "64:57", "sweet spot and and once you cross the", "64:59", "line how do you know when they're ready", "65:05", "well for me it's a feel and you know you", "65:08", "want to kind of feel it so that you know", "65:11", "when you touch it", "65:13", "it doesn't feel raw but it starts to", "65:16", "give it a slight spring and then you", "65:18", "pull it and then like I said earlier", "65:21", "it's like you kind of like slide into", "65:22", "home you let that residual heat in that", "65:24", "temperature kind of slow down a lot of", "65:27", "times if you're going a bit fast you", "65:28", "take it and they have like some cold", "65:30", "melted butter not too cold still a", "65:32", "little bit liquid and you cook it and", "65:34", "then you just dunk it right into the", "65:36", "butter and it just arrests the cooking", "65:38", "and then you have it there and like then", "65:40", "the guests come and then all you have to", "65:41", "do is just like heat it up a little bit", "65:43", "and then it goes it's not though I mean", "65:49", "it's like you're gonna dial it in you", "65:51", "know it's it depends on what you want", "65:54", "you know the end result so like you know", "65:56", "you have guests coming over you want to", "65:58", "enjoy your time with them you know you", "65:59", "figure out little tricks what you can", "66:01", "get away with and what you can do my", "66:03", "friend Tom Papa he met earlier who's", "66:05", "getting tested for kovat along with you", "66:07", "when he has been in here before he", "66:10", "brings this homemade sourdough bread", "66:12", "that's just sensational I'm not a bread", "66:14", "guy I don't eat a lot of bread I eat", "66:16", "very little of it in fact especially now", "66:18", "but when I eat his like my god it's so", "66:21", "good and he's he keeps saying I'm", "66:23", "better every time I do it I'm like it's", "66:25", "fucking bread no are you getting better", "66:27", "no he's getting better it's crazy", "66:30", "he's my friend I'm just fucking around", "66:32", "but he's it's similar in a lot of ways", "66:36", "to your dry-aging too because he has", "66:38", "this starter which is a living thing", "66:40", "it's in you know his starters I don't", "66:44", "know how many years old it's old as fuck", "66:45", "though but he's been using this same", "66:47", "star that he got from somebody else and", "66:49", "just it brings soul to it yeah I think", "66:53", "soul to the food yeah for me and that in", "66:55", "that connection that you have to the", "66:57", "food is gonna also you know make you", "66:59", "care about it more while you cook it and", "67:01", "you know it's not just a commodity we're", "67:03", "like okay what are me 16 steaks in a box", "67:05", "you know and bring it in I mean you can", "67:08", "push out food like that there's a place", "67:09", "like there's a place for that in this", "67:11", "world well what I'm really hoping really", "67:13", "hoping is that some sort of a rapid test", "67:18", "for kovat not even like the 15-minute", "67:21", "one that we came because I heard", "67:22", "something about some saliva tests that", "67:24", "they're trying to develop that's", "67:25", "extremely rapid that would be amazing if", "67:28", "you could just test people right before", "67:30", "they come into your restaurant no one", "67:31", "has to worry about shit yeah you know", "67:33", "gearing up for what it's what the new", "67:35", "world is gonna be yeah temperature you", "67:37", "know everybody gets their temperature", "67:39", "taken you know but that's not good", "67:41", "enough see the temperature thing is not", "67:42", "good enough because if you're", "67:43", "asymptomatic but you're still spreading", "67:45", "it like why we're pretending like you", "67:47", "that's avoiding science we need to find", "67:49", "out whether or not people actually have", "67:50", "it this temperature thing is just", "67:52", "whether or not you're sick I know it", "67:54", "doesn't mean you don't have it if you're", "67:56", "if your temperature is low it's it's", "67:59", "real weird and that's what's being", "68:01", "that's what's gonna be mandated on us I", "68:03", "mean there's a certain series of things", "68:05", "that we're gonna have to do and it's you", "68:08", "know nobody knows for sure or what not", "68:10", "but you know who knows well at a certain", "68:13", "point in time I think we really need to", "68:15", "make a decision as to whether or not", "68:19", "we're just gonna allow this to take over",

is a factor this", "86:15", "swamp people because smallmouth bass", "86:17", "I've eaten it tastes much better oh yeah", "86:20", "I like it the same thing to my dry-aged", "86:22", "room with", "86:22", "that concept is that you know if you", "86:25", "don't have that free-flowing air and", "86:27", "that kind of that oxygen in the room it", "86:29", "has an impact on flavor if you have like", "86:31", "a swampy wet environment it's gonna", "86:33", "impact the B if I think about that all", "86:35", "the time here's an allergy the monkey", "86:36", "wrench into theory catfish catfish is", "86:39", "delicious it's delicious but if you have", "86:42", "a catfish from a pond it's not as", "86:44", "vicious so like River catfish is what", "86:46", "you want because it's following

yeah right that's like", "87:18", "the spices and the frost is what you're", "87:20", "eating more than the actual flavor of", "87:22", "the flesh itself yeah last time I", "87:25", "entertained fly food I haven't done it", "87:28", "in years but last time I entertained it", "87:30", "I was with my family we were in Montana", "87:32", "we were taking a whitewater rafting trip", "87:35", "down the Gallatin River which is really", "87:36", "fun yeah", "87:37", "but as we're going there there was all", "87:39", "these guys that were fly-fishing and", "87:41", "they seemed like the most peaceful", "87:43", "people as well just casting and and just", "87:46", "just slowly manipulating this and then", "87:49", "they were catching these these trout and", "87:51", "then just gently catching them and then", "87:53", "releasing them yep and we have a group", "87:55", "of guys that we do this with we travel", "87:57", "all around this maybe about like eight", "87:59", "to ten of us where we'll go and we'll go", "88:01", "on a trip together and Jimmy Kimmel does", "88:04", "this with you oh yeah oh he is he is", "88:06", "obsessed with fly-fishing you know we", "88:09", "are both like this is a whole journey we", "88:11", "logged the trips we talked about what", "88:13", "this caught you catch your do you rather", "88:16", "tie your own flies um I've done it but I", "88:19", "don't do it now I mean with the", "88:21", "restaurant the way it is you know it's", "88:23", "it's I'm always just so Tomkins so", "88:25", "time-consuming and now that they make", "88:27", "such beautiful patterns but there is", "88:28", "maybe the next level like when I retire", "88:31", "quote-unquote you know like Delvin so I", "88:33", "have like a whole mailbox desk", "88:36", "all like the hackle and everything there", "88:39", "but it's just sitting there you know you", "88:40", "talk about how making your own knives is", "88:44", "like another level I would imagine the", "88:46", "tying your own fly it's the same and", "88:48", "then attach matter out you know it's", "88:50", "that whole process the lead up to you", "88:52", "have a pattern or it's even just like", "88:54", "what are they eating seeing what's again", "88:56", "what's hatching coming off and matching", "88:58", "the hatch there's some the temperature", "89:01", "of the water the water levels the speed", "89:03", "like the first thing we check before we", "89:05", "go on a trip is what are the water", "89:07", "levels what's the the water flow like", "89:10", "was you know if it's going too fast like", "89:12", "the trout or like getting like all the", "89:14", "dirt everything you know hitting them in", "89:17", "the face you know but like there's a", "89:19", "certain like level where you look for", "89:21", "where it's best for yes or it's always", "89:24", "like okay what are the conditions like", "89:25", "you know you go through it so it's like", "89:27", "a whole process before like the lead in", "89:29", "that how did you start well I've always", "89:32", "loved you know fishing like any kind", "89:34", "deep-sea anything as a kid like it was", "89:36", "my escape since I was a little kid but I", "89:40", "think that I always looked at", "89:42", "fly-fishing as like the higher level you", "89:44", "know I always aspired there was like", "89:46", "like I saw I remember being on the", "89:49", "Delaware River and I was at camp and", "89:51", "there was a guy just underneath a bridge", "89:53", "and he just kind of picked up like 20 30", "89:56", "yards of wine he just laid it down and I", "89:58", "was up at a high level and I just saw", "90:00", "the fish come up and bite it and I was", "90:01", "just like I was like whoa you know just", "90:04", "like blew me away and then from that", "90:06", "point on I always wanted to and then I", "90:08", "bought my first fly rod and they always", "90:11", "remember you're you know you always", "90:12", "remember your first fly rod I still have", "90:14", "it and and it just started the obsession", "90:18", "there there's just something about the", "90:19", "connection to the fish and the whole", "90:21", "thing as opposed to just kind of like", "90:23", "going on a boat and trolling and waiting", "90:26", "for them to strike like this is more", "90:27", "like hunting what you're doing is is", "90:29", "like you're trying to find the location", "90:32", "of the fish and then you have to place", "90:34", "the fly and you have to like let it", "90:37", "drift without any drag and it's like", "90:39", "this combination of skill and intuition", "90:41", "and hunting that's the excitement", "90:43", "whereas just catching and throwing meat", "90:45", "in the thing okay I mean I've done it", "90:47", "and I still do it I like me on the water", "90:49", "fly-fishing is just like this", "90:51", "higher-level thing do you do any kind of", "90:53", "fishing with lures other than", "90:55", "fly-fishing do you ever like not really", "90:58", "and I can't even like there's so much", "90:59", "social pressure you know amongst my", "91:02", "group anyway because they get on me", "91:05", "because all most of the guys are Drive", "91:07", "like Jimmy is like dry fly only like", "91:09", "even if like no vegetation dry flies or", "91:12", "flies that float on the float on the", "91:14", "surface it's like the epitome of like", "91:15", "delicate presentation and then", "91:17", "underneath you know you can basically", "91:20", "you follow like the life cycle of an", "91:23", "insect so in the eggs go to the bottom", "91:27", "and then it the larva comes up and it", "91:29", "kind of floats the surface and then it", "91:31", "pops open and it flies away most of the", "91:35", "fish eat all the food that's subsurface", "91:37", "so before it even gets to the surface so", "91:39", "their eyes are like straight down when", "91:41", "the conditions are right the trout are", "91:44", "looking up because the hatch happens so", "91:46", "that's when all the bugs are coming up", "91:47", "and that takes you see the fish and it's", "91:50", "more dramatic", "91:51", "jimmy is like straight up like dry fly", "91:55", "fisherman like even a fly and all comes", "91:57", "from like one of our mentors and this is", "91:59", "Huey Lewis like he's part of the Lewis", "92:01", "in the news yes he's one I really like", "92:03", "he is like one of like he's one of our", "92:05", "group hip to be square yeah 100%", "92:08", "he is lives in Montana and he is like we", "92:11", "talk about every year fishing on the", "92:13", "Bitterroot for the swallow hatch which", "92:15", "is a certain kind of almost like a", "92:17", "salmon fly it's very large hmm and when", "92:19", "these things come up and and hatch like", "92:22", "fish are huge and they're hitting and", "92:24", "jumping out of the water it's very", "92:25", "dramatic so Wow yeah and does everybody", "92:28", "catch them release or does any do you", "92:30", "have one of the people that catch them", "92:32", "and cook them not in our crew it's very", "92:34", "look down upon huge you'd never I mean", "92:38", "even me like Oh like they they tease me", "92:41", "because if they're not biting on the", "92:43", "Flies like I'll drop a bead head which", "92:45", "is like underneath the fly and so it's", "92:48", "like kind of like they call it like", "92:49", "bobber fishing - cheating cheating so", "92:52", "it's not like they call it down and", "92:54", "dirty that's opposed to you know on the", "92:56", "surface that's so silly yeah yeah isn't", "92:58", "it crazy sometimes I just want to see a", "93:01", "fish at the end listen", "93:02", "there's bowhunters you know i bowhunt", "93:04", "and there's bow hunters there also rifle", "93:06", "hunt and then there's bow hunters that", "93:08", "look at rifle hunters like it's like", "93:09", "legalized poaching yep like what are you", "93:11", "doing I'm using a rifle the animal see", "93:14", "yeah but then there's other people that", "93:16", "have a really good ethical argument for", "93:18", "that like hey if I am at 200 yards", "93:21", "they'll see an elk or a deer and I", "93:24", "squeeze that trigger that is a dead", "93:26", "animal 100% of the time it's a huge", "93:28", "response another person it's not but", "93:30", "it's very high 90s yeah yeah that's a", "93:34", "huge responsibility for the animal I", "93:36", "mean you know you want the animal just", "93:37", "you know not suffer well it's also", "93:40", "there's something about the difficulty", "93:42", "factor of bow hunting it's very", "93:44", "effective when the arrow hits the animal", "93:46", "is the animals die like they could die", "93:50", "as quick if not quicker than a rifle", "93:52", "with a well-placed arrow because they", "93:53", "bleed so quickly it goes through the", "93:55", "vitals and they're done in seconds but", "93:58", "it's harder to do and it requires an", "94:02", "immense amount of discipline and", "94:04", "dedication and I'm sure fly-fishing", "94:07", "requires some but with bow hunting you", "94:09", "literally have to practice every day", "94:11", "yeah I mean you think you saw in the", "94:12", "back I have a archery range in the", "94:14", "garage back there where you see there's", "94:16", "a 45 yard range and I shoot arrows every", "94:19", "day I love it I have a boat too like a", "94:22", "PCSO yes yeah it's beautiful it's a", "94:25", "great boa went down with my friend going", "94:27", "Jonas he like took me down easily he's", "94:29", "like hunters like this is what you get", "94:31", "and I got it and I don't get enough", "94:34", "practicing I've never gone hunting with", "94:35", "it so you know yeah it's not something I", "94:38", "recommend when I wanted to so I mean I", "94:41", "you know I have friends that want to do", "94:43", "it I want to go bow hunting with you", "94:45", "Mike no you don't yeah if you did you'd", "94:47", "be out there practicing every day like", "94:49", "it's it's it's a thing that once you", "94:51", "once you realize what's at stake how", "94:54", "difficult it is to do how much respect", "94:56", "you have to have for the the art of", "94:58", "archery and how much how much effort has", "95:01", "to be put into the discipline most", "95:03", "people don't want to do that like if you", "95:04", "really want to hunt your own meat and", "95:06", "this is one of the things that's come up", "95:07", "during this pandemic because people are", "95:08", "really scared about the food supply and", "95:10", "they're scared about not having food in", "95:12", "their home that they can rely upon and", "95:15", "all", "95:16", "so before that there was this whole", "95:17", "thing about gathering organic meat like", "95:20", "people were worried about the source of", "95:22", "the meat they were worried about animals", "95:24", "that weren't treated correctly in", "95:25", "factory farming and all those all the", "95:27", "different things that people should be", "95:28", "concerned about and the ultimate", "95:31", "solution to that is get an animal that's", "95:32", "in the wild yeah this is way this way", "95:35", "this animals been living the way they've", "95:36", "been living for hundreds of thousands of", "95:38", "years and you just you you stealthily", "95:42", "make your way through their world get", "95:44", "yourself into a position and then", "95:46", "through hard work and dedication and", "95:49", "understanding and take an animal", "95:51", "ethically yep", "95:52", "I'm with you on that you know I think", "95:54", "it's great I mean and also I love that", "95:56", "you you know the responsibility you take", "95:58", "for it you know it's it's like you know", "95:59", "some people don't understand hunting", "96:01", "they think it's just a bunch of Yahoo's", "96:02", "going out there and some maybe are but", "96:04", "you know the people that I know that", "96:06", "take it seriously you know take a huge", "96:08", "responsibility with it and the people", "96:10", "that I know that do it that take a huge", "96:12", "responsibility", "96:13", "they're some of the best people I've", "96:14", "ever met my life and the most dedicated", "96:16", "and the kind of hunting that I do which", "96:19", "is Western mountain elk hunting yeah", "96:21", "requires physical fitness requires", "96:24", "incredible stamina because you're you're", "96:26", "going gaining and losing thousands of", "96:29", "feet of elevation in a day you might", "96:31", "track 15 20 miles every day I mean you", "96:34", "have to be fit and you have to be ready", "96:36", "and then you have to be able to keep", "96:38", "your nerves yeah and then a final moment", "96:40", "yeah you know it's it's like yeah you", "96:43", "could hunt for ten days for one moment", "96:45", "so you're you're hunting for 10 days for", "96:47", "15 seconds it's profound like a build up", "96:50", "it's amazing you know you gotta keep", "96:52", "your shit yeah it's it's hard and", "96:54", "there's no catch and release you know", "96:56", "catch release and bone yeah but when I", "96:59", "sit down to say the code though if you", "97:02", "really look at it it's I mean if just", "97:04", "focus on the catch and release or", "97:05", "whatever but there's a code to it I mean", "97:08", "you get it you know I I believe in that", "97:11", "yeah the code the difference between bow", "97:13", "hunting and regular hunting versus", "97:15", "regular fishing and fly even just right", "97:18", "regular hunting you know and bow hunting", "97:20", "I'm just saying you're hunting with guys", "97:22", "yes that you know have an ethical", "97:24", "responsibility understand the", "97:26", "environment you know and follow the", "97:28", "rules and", "97:29", "I think that you know yeah that's", "97:31", "amazing well it's also the thing to", "97:34", "consider is there's millions and in fact", "97:36", "billions of dollars every year that go", "97:38", "into wildlife habitat go into", "97:42", "preservation all the different people", "97:46", "that work as game wardens are all paid", "97:49", "by this and this is all money that's", "97:51", "taken from hunting licenses protect the", "97:54", "pikmin Robertson Act they take a certain", "97:57", "percentage of I think it's ten percent", "97:59", "of all the proceeds from ammunition", "98:01", "sales licenses equipment all that stuff", "98:06", "goes to preservation and it goes it", "98:08", "actually is the the number one the", "98:12", "source the number one source of for", "98:15", "economics and in terms of financial this", "98:19", "the like the the amount of resources", "98:22", "that go to managing these areas and", "98:24", "keeping these animals healthy and", "98:26", "monitoring them and monitoring their", "98:28", "populations and even reintroducing", "98:30", "different animals like Rocky Mountain", "98:32", "sheep but all these different animals", "98:33", "that elk that get introduced into all", "98:35", "these different places all that money", "98:37", "comes from hunting and it's it's crazy", "98:40", "to think that at one point in time most", "98:43", "of the animals in North America that we", "98:45", "hunt on a regular basis we're on the", "98:46", "verge of extinction including", "98:48", "white-tailed deer which is crazy to", "98:50", "think if you live in a craze that as", "98:51", "white-tailed deer because there's so", "98:53", "many of them it's insane but there's", "98:55", "more whitetail deer today than they were", "98:57", "when Columbus landed it's really really", "98:59", "weird yeah and this is an incredible", "99:02", "system the wildlife management system", "99:05", "that's in place in North America", "99:07", "including the management of public lands", "99:09", "and the access to public lands is a", "99:11", "truly special place it's it's it's truly", "99:14", "special here in North America and that", "99:15", "is because of the people that love", "99:17", "hunting and love these wild areas yeah", "99:20", "it makes sense I mean I love it the", "99:21", "sustainability factors everything and I", "99:23", "mean I think that's also why the catch", "99:25", "for at least thing I mean if everybody", "99:26", "kept everything that they caught there's", "99:29", "just not enough right like in that", "99:31", "environment no I understand you know and", "99:34", "people say that about hunting too that", "99:36", "if everybody went out and hunted you", "99:37", "would you do what there wouldn't be", "99:38", "animals left which is really true so but", "99:42", "every", "99:42", "not gonna do it that's like saying if", "99:44", "everybody became a marathon runner the", "99:46", "streets would be filled yeah but then", "99:48", "you're not gonna yeah that's not", "99:49", "appealing did a lot of people you know", "99:51", "everyone's not gonna do and it's very", "99:53", "difficult and especially this stuff that", "99:55", "I like to do it's just very day you can", "99:56", "do it", "99:57", "yeah a lot of people do it but not", "99:59", "nearly as many as go to the supermarket", "100:01", "yeah yeah when you get your meat do you", "100:04", "have a specific rancher that you use or", "100:06", "no it's a great question and it's you", "100:09", "know everything is a process and it's", "100:11", "part of the process they're just kind of", "100:12", "like aging the meat and then putting on", "100:14", "the plate but there's a whole backstory", "100:15", "to this I've developed a relationship", "100:18", "one of my closest friends and my mentor", "100:21", "and beef is this guy by the name of John", "100:22", "tarp wolf and you know he's he picks out", "100:27", "the cattle and and then it goes through", "100:31", "the system and you know they audit the", "100:33", "system and he I knew him before he came", "100:35", "on board with Neyman ranch so I knew him", "100:39", "when he had his own slaughterhouse in in", "100:42", "Granite City Illinois and I met him", "100:46", "through the guys from master purveyors", "100:47", "and then he became I guess the vp of", "100:51", "beef in Neyman ranch and so I invest", "100:54", "most of my focus with him and he's", "100:56", "taught me so he's picking out a lot of", "100:58", "my cattle and that gets since it's done", "101:01", "through family farms all antibiotic-free", "101:04", "steroid-free raised ethically animals", "101:09", "died with with dignity they're not like", "101:11", "cattle prodded and pushed along I mean", "101:14", "there's do they done well most of them", "101:17", "we'll all them it's this basically it's", "101:19", "like a like a pin you know it's like a", "101:21", "it's like a stun bolt and they're like", "101:24", "No
