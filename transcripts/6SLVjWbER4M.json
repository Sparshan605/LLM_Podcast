a", "78:05", "meritocracy anymore like you've you've", "78:07", "decided that they have to do better", "78:09", "right then white people they have to do", "78:12", "better than everybody else",

it's", "78:21", "like okay fine you you want to say that", "78:23", "like maybe you know we don't want we", "78:26", "won't want to like lower the scores a", "78:28", "little for other groups and you know why", "78:30", "but then to downgrade this personality", "78:32", "that's a part that how did they do a", "78:34", "downgrade personality what was the", "78:36", "method that they used to do that so they", "78:38", "said okay we're not just gonna rely on", "78:40", "standardized tests okay so that's the", "78:41", "thing like standardized tests you know", "78:43", "they're they they can be easily gained", "78:47", "that was idea that like you can just go", "78:49", "for more tuition extra classes and", "78:51", "you'll do well well we care about the", "78:53", "holistic package of the applicants so", "78:56", "you want to see more personality", "78:57", "ultimately this is about you know what", "79:00", "Aristotle called the Telos right what is", "79:02", "the Telos of higher education what's the", "79:04", "ultimate goal or essence of higher", "79:07", "education is it to just produce perfect", "79:09", "cogs in the machine of the global", "79:12", "economy or is it you know to produce", "79:14", "engage citizens or whatever it is right", "79:16", "like so however you define that question", "79:18", "what's the purpose of higher education", "79:20", "you could tailor your entrance methods", "79:23", "to meet that and in Harvard's case they", "79:26", "decided well you know we're going to", "79:29", "instead of just looking at your GPA your", "79:33", "essay we want to see you want to", "79:35", "interview the person want to see what", "79:37", "your personality is like can you thrive", "79:38", "at Harvard are you going to be a good", "79:40", "contributing member of this yeah exactly", "79:44", "and you know this is one of the areas in", "79:46", "which consistently you look like the", "79:48", "Asian population that was applying to", "79:50", "Harvard was downgraded in that score", "79:53", "they scored really high when it came to", "79:55", "like extracurriculars academics they", "79:58", "were so strong on on SATs and and you", "80:00", "know all these other standardized tests", "80:02", "but when it came to personality they", "80:04", "were very consistently downgraded so do", "80:06", "you think that that characteristic like", "80:08", "that the seeking out that was that was", "80:11", "applied specifically to try to limit the", "80:13", "amount of Asian people cuz that's the", "80:15", "argument right um you know I don't know", "80:19", "it was done specifically for that but I", "80:21", "think Harvard has a again monocultures", "80:25", "suck in general so you know if you're", "80:29", "gonna look for even for me like I was", "80:31", "coming to study in America like you know", "80:33", "ten thousand miles away right from the", "80:35", "place I grew up I don't really want to", "80:36", "go to school without lot of Asians cuz", "80:38", "like I could have just stayed there", "80:39", "frankly but I I was looking for for for", "80:43", "something that wasn't a monoculture you", "80:45", "don't have to just expand your mind", "80:46", "right so any other day the issue with", "80:49", "Harvard is that it was taking federal", "80:51", "money and if you see Harvard as a", "80:53", "stepping stone to a career to a future", "80:56", "it is unfair it is kind of unfair if", "80:59", "they were penalizing you based on race", "81:02", "that's the hard part of proof whether or", "81:04", "not this was personality or race or some", "81:06", "sort of you know other thing that they", "81:07", "were selecting for that happened to", "81:09", "correlate with race that's the part that", "81:11", "that's hard so is it possible that they", "81:13", "were just trying to enhance the way", "81:16", "people communicate on campus and so they", "81:19", "sort of emphasized personality and", "81:21", "emphasized associate social interactions", "81:24", "and in doing so they penalized Asians", "81:27", "without being aware of it yeah kind of I", "81:29", "mean to be to be honest like you know", "81:31", "when I was in college I only did my", "81:33", "first jello shot like couple weeks ago", "81:35", "and couple weeks oh now yes okay well I", "81:39", "was that typical we don't need to do", "81:41", "jello shots to be in college on a thing", "81:43", "okay okay but I didn't I didn't have the", "81:45", "typical college experience you didn't", "81:47", "party an apartment", "81:51", "you know a lot of international students", "81:53", "who come from Asia will probably fall", "81:55", "under the same", "81:56", "habits like we're kind of like you know", "81:59", "we've been told that there's only one", "82:00", "way to succeed work hard and summa cum", "82:03", "laude and all these things so so a lot", "82:05", "of us kind of are culturally aligned on", "82:08", "that and and you know the do we", "82:11", "contribute to campus in the same way", "82:13", "that you're active student union leader", "82:16", "would who's involved in other curricula", "82:18", "I don't you know I don't know so would", "82:20", "harvard want a diversity of behaviors", "82:24", "and interests yeah probably yes you know", "82:26", "it's like boring stem people what you", "82:29", "want all kinds of different stuff and", "82:31", "you also want people that raise the bar", "82:33", "really high in terms of performance you", "82:36", "do yeah yeah I mean that's that's that", "82:38", "that enhances other people's", "82:40", "understanding of what's possible but as", "82:42", "a private institution you you can make", "82:45", "your student population up the way you", "82:46", "want right that's why you have what", "82:48", "Liberty University which is Jerry", "82:49", "Falwell yeah and it's for Christians", "82:51", "because but it's a private institution", "82:53", "they're not taking money from the", "82:55", "government so that's fine", "82:56", "unlike UC Berkeley state institution", "82:59", "they abolish affirmative action UCLA all", "83:02", "the UCS did look at the population", "83:04", "seventy eighty percent Asian interesting", "83:07", "California yeah why is that this is the", "83:13", "young comfortable you know this is the", "83:15", "part where we just you know like I don't", "83:17", "want saved you know cuz they kick ass", "83:21", "they work harder yeah a more dedicated", "83:24", "more disciplined people are very", "83:26", "uncomfortable to talk about differences", "83:28", "in group up come because we have to kind", "83:30", "of make everybody right the same or else", "83:33", "there must be some sort of systemic", "83:35", "thing but I think that Asians because", "83:37", "they're so hard-working and because they", "83:39", "don't complain this they get people get", "83:41", "away with this stuff where they get away", "83:44", "with discrimination against them I think", "83:47", "they're starting to complain the", "83:48", "lawsuits were filed so yeah they are", "83:50", "starting to but it's like it took that", "83:53", "doesn't like alright you fucks and", "83:55", "there's actually quite a big pro-trump", "83:58", "asian-americans voting bloc mmm you know", "84:00", "this this this particular issue of", "84:04",
