shows them", "14:17", "how to get there and they all go there", "14:19", "we had an incident once on fear factor", "14:21", "where we covered these people with bees", "14:22", "there was like a beekeeper there and he", "14:24", "had his hive and a local hive came over", "14:27", "and a group of bees came over and met", "14:29", "with these bees and we had to clear the", "14:31", "area out and they had to have a", "14:32", "conversation hey that's literally what", "14:35", "happened they were in the air just", "14:37", "floating around and then they worked it", "14:39", "out and then the our bees came back and", "14:42", "they went back to the hive and their", "14:43", "bees went about their business they were", "14:44", "just like what the fuck's going on you", "14:46", "guys moving in here like what are you", "14:47", "doing territorial somehow or another", "14:49", "they worked it out though there was no", "14:50", "bee death there was that be fuckin", "14:53",
