["00:00", "the Joe Rogan experience David Seaman", "00:02", "who's on the podcast last week had a", "00:04", "really interesting take on Bitcoin that", "00:06", "I thought was kind of funny he was", "00:08", "saying that if if like Bank of America", "00:12", "for say if they were smart that they", "00:14", "would get involved in Bitcoin he was", "00:16", "like you already have this established", "00:18", "name brand like cryptocurrencies are", "00:21", "gonna be here they're there they're here", "00:23", "to stay", "00:23", "this is his take he's like why wouldn't", "00:26", "you capitalize on the name brand that", "00:28", "you've already built in on and getting", "00:30", "on the mark and quick get in on it now", "00:33", "in the early days and established like", "00:35", "that Bank of America like still has like", "00:39", "a footing in in this as well", "00:41", "as in regular money and he was like it", "00:43", "would be a really wise investment I", "00:45", "think you're gonna see that happening in", "00:48", "short time really we saw this with the", "00:52", "Internet which was at first the", "00:53", "telecommunications companies fought", "00:55", "tooth and nail they could not believe", "00:57", "that a decentralized packet switch", "01:00", "network like the internet would deliver", "01:02", "quality voice and quality video they", "01:04", "wanted to build highly controlled and", "01:06", "structured networks and they tried to", "01:09", "fight it because it threatened the", "01:10", "long-distance market which was very", "01:12", "lucrative it threatened many other", "01:14", "markets today three-quarters of all", "01:16", "international calls have known skype 3/4", "01:19", "3/4 that's that's a market that a few", "01:23", "you know a two decades ago was 15 20", "01:26", "billion dollar market and disappeared", "01:28", "and essentially they had to restructure", "01:30", "operations now they made up for it the", "01:32", "smart ones became very good as Internet", "01:36", "service providers and created whole new", "01:38", "businesses that replace those lost", "01:40", "revenues so so what happened there is", "01:42", "you have these telecom companies trying", "01:45", "to fight it until some of the smaller", "01:48", "ones some of the ones that don't have", "01:49", "solid entrenched positions and can't", "01:52", "take advantage of size think you know", "01:54", "what I mean I'm gonna cut off from this", "01:56", "herd and go play with that Bitcoin a bit", "01:59", "and as soon as that starts happening", "02:00", "there's almost a stampede because", "02:02", "everybody tries to rush into it that's", "02:04", "what happens with telecommunications the", "02:06", "smaller providers started peeling off", "02:08", "from the herd and instead of fighting it", "02:09", "they started trying to build service", "02:11", "providers so it's really just a matter", "02:13", "who runs first right someone's gonna", "02:15", "start running and then right and then", "02:18", "the herd breaks apart because until the", "02:21", "first one breaks everyone's like wow", "02:23", "we're too serious for this Bitcoin stuff", "02:25", "and they're looking over their shoulder", "02:27", "trying to make sure that everybody else", "02:29", "is also staying away from it but", "02:31", "eventually the market dynamic changes so", "02:34", "it's just essentially it's just human", "02:36", "nature like with human nature there's", "02:38", "two certain rules that are just always", "02:40", "going to be into place play hard-to-get", "02:41", "and follow leader those are two big ones", "02:44", "yeah and Bitcoin threatens some business", "02:49", "structures within the banking industry", "02:51", "admits gonna make it difficult for them", "02:52", "to charge exorbitant fees to do", "02:54", "international wire transfers when you", "02:55", "can do it cheaper just like if you have", "02:57", "Skype you can't justify three dollars a", "03:00", "minute long-distance calls", "03:02", "right and but at the same time the smart", "03:06", "banker is looking at this and their", "03:07", "thing yeah but if we have a cheap", "03:11", "efficient secure payment system we can", "03:13", "build some really interesting things on", "03:15", "top of that and creates whole new", "03:17", "businesses that are very competitive", "03:18", "that can actually give us a lead so we", "03:21", "outrun the herd the you know disruption", "03:25", "in a competitive market is actually very", "03:28", "very enticing to the to the second and", "03:32", "third tier players because they don't", "03:34", "have an advantage they're too small to", "03:36", "compete against the big guys but if they", "03:38", "see this disruptive technology I think", "03:39", "well maybe if I hitch a ride on that I'm", "03:42", "gonna overtake everybody and you know I", "03:45", "can be the blockbuster or I can be the", "03:48", "Netflix I can be the Tower Records or I", "03:51", "can be the iTunes and we've seen this", "03:54", "happen in technology races before yeah", "03:57", "that's fascinating", "03:58", "how people some people just don't want", "04:00", "to buck the trends they do they don't", "04:02", "want to go along with the flow of things", "04:03", "or they want to buck the trends they", "04:05", "want to somehow or another figure out a", "04:08", "way where you know they can prove", "04:09", "everybody else wrong and VHS is making a", "04:11", "comeback and you know renting movies is", "04:13", "still valid you know there's there's a", "04:15", "lot of those fuckers out there that just", "04:17", "won't let it go radio companies change", "04:20", "is scary yeah it is scary but that's", "04:23", "that's that's the nature of the beast", "04:25", "especially today we were involved in the", "04:28", "craziest time for change the world has", "04:29", "ever known", "04:30", "yeah um there are at the moments being", "04:34", "on the top of an industry especially an", "04:36", "industry that's involved in technology", "04:37", "is a very precarious position you know", "04:40", "if you talk to Kodak a decade ago do you", "04:46", "think they would they would realize that", "04:48", "suddenly the largest vendor or", "04:52", "manufacturer of cameras in the world", "04:54", "would be a telephone company nokia nokia", "04:57", "within three years became the world's", "05:00", "largest maker of cameras and suddenly", "05:03", "the entire industry changed right and", "05:05", "how do you compete against that they're", "05:07", "not even in your industry they just came", "05:09", "out of left field it's like you're", "05:10", "suddenly the horse buggy manufacturer", "05:12", "and Ford is taking your business and you", "05:15", "never expected that was gonna happen", "05:16", "well nokia has a camera phone now a", "05:19", "Windows Phone that is some insane amount", "05:23", "of pixels it's like 40 fucking", "05:25", "megapixels or something some crate 41 41", "05:29", "megapixel says Jamie Jamie's on top of", "05:31", "that shit", "05:31", "41 fucking megapixels on a phone I mean", "05:34", "this thing I think has of the note 3 I", "05:36", "think it that's 12 or something no it's", "05:40", "better than that you familiar with", "05:42", "Moore's law yes so so for your listeners", "05:45", "too Moore's law it was created by Gordon", "05:47", "more processors right processing speed", "05:50", "and yeah and what he said was that he", "05:52", "estimated because of the way silicon", "05:54", "works every 18 months the speed of a", "05:58", "computer would double or the price would", "06:00", "drop by half and that has been true now", "06:03", "for more than 25 years and and that", "06:07", "thing then plays out in camera", "06:09", "megapixels in storage on SD cards in the", "06:12", "size of the of your smartphone in the", "06:15", "number of sensors you can put into the", "06:17", "smartphone and it's battery battery life", "06:20", "is the one that's lagging behind and", "06:21", "it's the main thing that's holding back", "06:23", "this technology Moore's law also applies", "06:26", "to things like Bitcoin it also applies", "06:27", "to networks like the internet and what", "06:30", "it means is that if you're in an", "06:32", "industry that's established then", "06:33", "suddenly you have a competitor that's", "06:35", "coming at you with the power of Moore's", "06:36", "law you know better watch out because", "06:39", "you're in", "06:39", "it's not a matter of whether you will be", "06:41", "able to compete in a decade it's a", "06:43", "matter of whether your industry will", "06:44", "still exist in a decade right right yeah", "06:47", "that fascinating that whole industries", "06:50", "can just vanish 150 years of Kodak and", "06:54", "then suddenly film doesn't exist God in", "06:57", "the decade do you remember when you used", "06:58", "to have to pay money for a long distance", "07:01", "you know long distance calls don't exist", "07:04", "like you didn't call New York right now", "07:05", "on your home
