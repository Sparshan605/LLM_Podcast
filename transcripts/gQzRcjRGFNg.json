were there were", "06:26", "guards 24 hours a day which meant there", "06:28", "was also a shift that slept during the", "06:30", "day to cot at night and then and then", "06:32", "crashed in the

then I did it just", "07:09", "for the sake of my mood yeah that's", "07:10", "always in the narrative this cat stuff", "07:12", "that there's somehow another unhinged", "07:16", "because they're on

guys would have", "07:25", "sometimes have fistfights in front of me", "07:27", "and that kind of thing not all the time", "07:29", "but yeah they would get the they would", "07:31", "get hopped up they would just get", "07:32", "jittery and that's it's very dangerous", "07:34", "with Kalashnikovs lying around so their", "07:38", "culture", "07:38", "somehow or another has evolved to this", "07:42", "point where it's insanely common to", "07:45", "kidnap people to the point where if you", "07:47", "if you talk about Somali pirates they're", "07:49", "there very few countries where pirates", "07:53", "go after their name so easily", "07:55", "yeah the the kidnapping became part of", "07:59", "the culture that's true but pirate", "08:01", "bosses which are not so active now off",

"08:53", "there's always a place in Sudan where it", "08:55", "shifts from being willing to being", "08:58", "unwilling well this is an issue that's", "09:00", "been going on in Libya recently I'm sure", "09:02", "you saw the most recent slave auctions", "09:05", "that were videotaped and put on YouTube", "09:08", "which was the stories are awful I've", "09:10", "heard this firsthand yeah insanely", "09:11", "disturbing that you're watching a", "09:13", "videotape of slave auctions in 2018 it's", "09:18", "well it's more than disturbing it's a", "09:20", "revival of what was going on when", "09:23", "slavery was legal so in other words okay", "09:27", "where the where the Somalis are involved", "09:29", "up to the to the Libyan border is one", "09:33", "story and that's a story I've covered", "09:35", "what happens in Libya is a different", "09:38", "story the clans and the routes that", "09:40", "migrants take through Libya the clans", "09:43", "they put themselves in the hands of are", "09:46", "still the same as the clans and the", "09:49", "routes that we use during the slave", "09:50", "trade so there's a there's almost like a", "09:54", "you know there's a there's a historical", "09:56", "memory there of what what went on and", "09:59", "it's the same thing happening so so I", "10:02", "suspect a lot of migrants don't quite", "10:04", "know how bad it can get the route up", "10:07", "until Libya is probably easier than", "10:11", "Libya itself Alivia itself sounds like a", "10:14", "horror show for the migrants well it's", "10:17", "particularly it's one of those bizarre", "10:19", "things we have a horrible dictator like", "10:21", "Muammar Qaddafi and you say well it's", "10:24", "probably a good thing get rid of that", "10:26", "guy right mm-hmm but no when you get rid", "10:28", "of them then you have this power vacuum", "10:29", "and apparently it's a failed state now", "10:32", "and it's gotten even worse yeah it's", "10:34", "it's going in the direction of Somalia", "10:36", "right now in there a couple of rival", "10:38", "governments I think it's a little bit", "10:39", "more stable then that Somalia was after", "10:42", "their dictator fell but it's", "10:44", "there's similar there's a similar thing", "10:46", "going on I it's true Gaddafi was a bad", "10:51", "guy and but he was also a bulwark and he", "10:54", "knew that and he used that to his", "10:56", "advantage", "10:57", "bulwark a bulwark against against", "10:59", "migration paths I've never heard that", "11:01", "expression bulwark a bulwark no what",

very", "21:51", "closely and the I helped raise some", "21:54", "money the the lawyers who were running", "21:57", "it let me down there and that was really", "22:00", "nice and it was nice for the guys too", "22:02", "because they were obviously confused it", "22:04", "was nothing but very well-meaning but", "22:06", "completely anonymous people around them", "22:08", "you know and then they were they kind of", "22:10", "came out of the terminal in Nairobi and", "22:13", "they were still obviously still sort of", "22:15", "a little bit confused and I tapped one", "22:17", "of them on the shoulder and he", "22:18", "recognized me and it was pandemonium Wow", "22:20", "it was wound upon Reuters video I think", "22:24", "it's available now how did you", "22:26", "eventually get freed

US and Germany and", "22:42", "when she talked the Pirates down to 1.6", "22:47", "million and I got out for some reason at", "22:50", "the very end the Pirates came down like", "22:52", "precipitously the very end after 30", "22:56", "years they were holding on for like I", "22:58", "think they went down to four or five", "23:00", "million or something like that and then", "23:01", "at the very end that came down to what", "23:03", "was on offer no explanation not really", "23:08", "except that from my point of view there", "23:11", "were labor there was a labor unrest", "23:13", "stirring among the guards so in other", "23:15", "words the guards were sick and holding", "23:17", "me Oh", "23:18", "and so I one day towards the very end", "23:22", "but you know a few weeks before I got", "23:24", "out one of the guards actually said", "23:26", "Michael we might go on strike right", "23:29", "she's right do you need some help with", "23:31", "that I can go on a hunger strike if you", "23:33", "want slow slow", "23:34", "now there was one thing that I read", "23:36", "where a guard had left you alone with a", "23:40", "loaded rifle and happened more than once", "23:45", "what is the what's the thought process", "23:48", "there in your mind yeah that was so", "23:50", "especially after the first year so", "23:53", "and until how many guards you talking", "23:55", "about we're talking about seven to", "23:57", "fifteen at any given point in how many", "24:00", "boats are in the gun well it was a", "24:02", "Kalashnikov so a minimum of 16 that's", "24:06", "not enough it's not enough and there", "24:11", "were there were there were always a few", "24:13", "guards who were asleep a few guards who", "24:16", "awake and so you go through this thing", "24:19", "in your head you think well I can grab", "24:22", "the gun I can kill a few guys but it", "24:25", "would be suicidal", "24:26", "but I went through various scenarios in", "24:30", "my head all the time you know that was a", "24:32", "that was a very big temptation because", "24:34", "the guns just lay around like junk you", "24:37", "know and that was that was a dark period", "24:42", "because the question was not just can I", "24:44", "blast my way out and live but also", "24:46", "should I just take care of it right and", "24:50", "kill myself now because I knew that I", "24:53", "was causing a whole lot of trouble for", "24:54", "my family at home and that were probably", "24:56", "military plans to come get me which", "24:58", "would put you know seals at risk or", "25:00", "special operators at risk and so it's", "25:03", "better to just check out and so that was", "25:06", "on my mind often especially during the", "25:08", "second year were they sympathetic", "25:12", "characters in any way I mean did you", "25:14", "when you were around them for long", "25:17", "periods of time and you're taking into", "25:19", "consideration this life that's been", "25:21", "thrust upon them", "25:22", "mmm-hmm this is the environment they", "25:24", "grew up in and this is their I mean you", "25:26", "had to have at least in some way God to", "25:29", "know them sure and I went there thinking", "25:31", "well you know I'm gonna tell their story", "25:33", "somehow yeah did you tell them that yeah", "25:36", "but by the time I was captured that", "25:38", "didn't matter you know yes of course", "25:42", "they they were especially the ones who", "25:44", "wanted to talk to me of course they were", "25:46", "sympathetic they're they're poor people", "25:49", "so the even if it's not true that most", "25:53", "Pirates are frustrated fishermen", "25:55", "probably only about 20% of them are all", "25:58", "of them report all of them need jobs and", "26:00", "that's why they became pirates", "26:02", "you have to layer on top of that the", "26:04", "fact that it cat habit is extremely", "26:06", "ruinously expensive Indra in Somalia", "26:09", "where does cat come from cut comes from", "26:12", "Highlands so it has to be grown in the", "26:14", "mountains of Ethiopia Kenya and flown in", "26:16", "fresh can't be grown in you know flat", "26:20", "hot desert region like like Somalia or", "26:22", "Yemen but that's where it's popular", "26:23", "especially among Muslims who can't drink", "26:25", "alcohol so it's there's a whole trade in", "26:30", "that region of the world and most of", "26:32", "most of the time it's legal they only", "26:34", "Ilya legalized it in Britain for example", "26:37", "in 2014", "26:39", "really yeah I think it's illegal here", "26:42", "but um the trade it just flows like", "26:44", "water in that in in Somalia and the", "26:46", "Arabian Peninsula", "26:48", "so the voluntary Coast Guard of Somalia", "26:51", "what we've been led to believe that this", "26:53", "is how it all started out how did that", "26:55", "narrative get established so once they", "26:58", "started to capture big ships they fell", "27:01", "back on that story which had been true", "27:03", "up till then which was which is", "27:05", "defending our coastline from fishing so", "27:07", "it started that way started started", "27:09", "that's not right it's true than the", "27:11", "roots of it okay so that's what I'd", "27:12", "heard what I had heard as I did was it", "27:14", "started because not just because people", "27:16", "were fishing out there because they were", "27:18", "dumping toxic waste also yeah and that", "27:22", "was that's also true the Mafia was", "27:24", "dumping what had a had a the mafia yeah", "27:28", "there was there were actual it's been", "27:30", "sort of uncovered by Italian journalists", "27:33", "but the Italian mafia had found a way to", "27:36", "bring waste for you know a certain", "27:39", "amount of money down to someplace where", "27:42", "they thought nobody would see it again", "27:44", "and that some of it washed ashore in", "27:48", "2004 with the Indonesian tsunami that", "27:51", "actually reached that part of East", "27:53", "Africa so some of those big things that", "27:57", "the the Italians dumped over the side of", "28:00", "their boats will end up on the beach in", "28:02", "Somalia", "28:03", "oh so an actual physical VAT or", "28:05", "something that they can see what it was", "28:07", "and I saw one of them yeah really yeah", "28:10", "what was in it I don't know but it was a", "28:12", "great big orange great big like weirdly", "28:17", "shaped cube how large taller than me so", "28:20", "at least eight feet square and it had", "28:23", "been used to contain some sort of toxic", "28:25", "waste that's what my fixer told me so", "28:27", "but I had seen pictures similar pictures", "28:30", "in documentaries so I think it was", "28:34", "probably true it's described in the book", "28:35", "just briefly but I that's the kind of", "28:39", "thing that happened certainly the the", "28:42", "Italians were not or the Mafia was not", "28:45", "being very you know they were being", "28:48", "criminals too so yeah that's that's", "28:50", "their business miss your business did", "28:53", "you watch the Tom Hanks movie I watched", "28:57", "45 minutes of the Tom Hanks movie in", "28:59", "Somalia in Somalia", "29:02", "while you were captive yeah holy shit", "29:04", "yeah what is that like well I so I knew", "29:08", "that I knew", "29:09", "captain Phillips was gonna be a movie", "29:11", "when I left that was already clear so", "29:15", "they announced it when you left and you", "29:17", "got to watch it when I'm in Somalia yeah", "29:20", "because by the time this was towards the", "29:22", "end of my captivity I had a shortwave", "29:24", "radio so I was listening to the radio by", "29:26", "the time it came out and went to the", "29:28", "Oscars it was all over the BBC so I knew", "29:30", "about it I knew it was out like okay so", "29:32", "I'm missing", "29:32", "captain Phillips whatever wonder what", "29:34", "that's like and then one day all the", "29:38", "guards got new smartphones", "29:40", "pretty fancy smartphones and they were", "29:42", "apparently loaded with a new collection", "29:44", "of films and music and whatever to keep", "29:46", "them occupied", "29:47", "one afternoon I saw two guards just", "29:49", "completely wrapped by some sort of film", "29:52", "on the phone and I heard some American", "29:56", "voices and I wonder what this film is", "29:57", "and finally I said fuck me that's Tom", "30:00", "Hanks so I knew what they were watching", "30:04", "and two weeks later one of the guards", "30:06", "actually handed me the phone and said", "30:07", "you know Michael look so I saw about 45", "30:11", "minutes of it Wow and of course when he", "30:13", "handed me the phone the first thing I", "30:14", "went that went through my mind is like", "30:16", "okay I'm gonna call mom and I think you", "30:17", "find her later", "30:18", "turn down the volume and and", "30:20", "and call California he took the phone", "30:24", "away before I did that but I had a whole", "30:26", "plan I developed a whole plan while I", "30:28", "was watching captain Phillips you know", "30:29", "get on the plane and Boston Logan or", "30:32", "whatever Wow", "30:34", "it was so atmospherically it was a", "30:37", "pretty good pretty well-done movie but", "30:38", "there are a couple of scenes where that", "30:40", "would it just wouldn't happen in real", "30:41", "life I didn't watch the movie yeah so", "30:44", "what was inaccurate about it there was", "30:46", "one scene where there was some selection", "30:48", "of pirates on the beach so in public and", "30:53", "I thought gosh how did they get that", "30:54", "that's that's I've never even heard of", "30:56", "that before and then uh then I thought", "30:58", "about it and thought and realized whoa", "30:59", "that yeah I actually wouldn't happen", "31:01", "like that in public that was just for", "31:03", "dramatic purposes you know I was I was", "31:06", "envious of their material at first and", "31:08", "then I realized oh they made that up so", "31:11", "things like that but the Pirates were", "31:14", "fascinated to see people like them and", "31:15", "in some cases their friends portrayed on", "31:18", "screen even though we all know how it", "31:21", "you know the movie ends very badly for", "31:23", "Somali pirates so they knew about the", "31:27", "story hope that was based on yeah no", "31:29", "question not only that but one of them", "31:31", "said that he was friends with one of the", "31:32", "Pirates involved and I believe him", "31:34", "actually he had the right clan", "31:36", "affiliation for that so it's quite", "31:38", "possible what was it like to see them", "31:41", "watching their story being depicted on", "31:44", "the other side of the planet well that's", "31:46", "what was weird is that they they were so", "31:48", "fascinated by it but we you know", "31:51", "otherwise they didn't necessarily like", "31:54", "to talk about bad news for pirates or", "31:56", "you know like I said when the hostages", "31:59", "were released or rescued in the first", "32:03", "few days of my captivity I kept hearing", "32:07", "that the hostages had been killed so", "32:09", "they like to spin things in a good way", "32:12", "for for pirates in general so I just", "32:14", "would have assumed they would just", "32:16", "ignore captain Phillips because it end", "32:18", "so badly they were just fascinated they", "32:21", "really were and so what was daily life", "32:23", "like for you like you do you ate with", "32:25", "them", "32:25", "well I separately but sometimes in the", "32:28", "same room they made very bad", "32:33", "food boiled beans and flavorless boiled", "32:38", "goat and that kind but they would eat", "32:42", "from a communal platter sort of", "32:45", "elsewhere within sight I didn't have to", "32:48", "eat from the same planet as the by hand", "32:51", "yeah by hand yeah yeah that's very", "32:54", "common in that part of the world yeah it", "32:56", "really is because utensils just aren't", "32:57", "aren't that common and they really like", "32:59", "spaghetti so they sort of wrapped the", "33:01", "spaghetti around your fingers and I had", "33:03", "done that as a free man you know I sort", "33:04", "of sat with somalis and and ate that way", "33:07", "but as a hostage I was in no mood to be", "33:10", "that you know that friendly yeah they", "33:14", "they gave me a fork and I could eat my", "33:16", "on my own so how what kind of physical", "33:20", "state were you in after two and a half", "33:22", "years of this yeah it was pretty bad I", "33:23", "was my my immune system had started to", "33:27", "fall apart so I don't go into detail too", "33:30", "much about this in the book but I had a", "33:33", "staph infection of my skin and some", "33:35", "other kind of infection my ear and I was", "33:38", "just something in my lungs I was just", "33:40", "not very I was sick and I was sick", "33:43", "constantly for several months before I", "33:45", "got out so I knew something had really", "33:47", "changed and I think the Pirates were", "33:49", "aware of that too slowly I think that", "33:52", "probably possibly contributed to them", "33:54", "lowering your ransom possibly but but I", "33:57", "you know the not they were sympathetic", "34:00", "but I it's possible they saw me sort of", "34:03", "reaching reaching my physical limit", "34:06", "slowly yeah slowly so it's not it's", "34:10", "actually can get you pretty quickly no", "34:11", "yeah I mean they it wound up just being", "34:15", "that but it was raising boils on my skin", "34:17", "and they knew about that so that's not", "34:20", "that long ago 2012 to 2014 was when you", "34:25", "were really was released and had the", "34:26", "infection I mean four years ago that's", "34:31", "nothing I'm pushing four years now yeah", "34:33", "what is what does it feel like now to be", "34:36", "free do you do you still have do have", "34:38", "PTSD from it do you get well now I can", "34:43", "be happy about it I think the", "34:44", "I was released I was sort of I felt", "34:48", "better in stages but I wasn't a sudden", "34:51", "you know euphoria", "34:53", "now I can be really be happy about it I", "34:56", "took me about a year to get back to full", "34:58", "strength and the symptoms of PTSD that I", "35:01", "showed when I first got out which", "35:04", "included like hyper hyper vigilance went", "35:08", "away slowly as I got physically strong", "35:10", "hyper vigilance being like wake up in", "35:12", "the middle of the night nightmares that", "35:14", "well that nightmares only happened", "35:17", "within the first year waking up in the", "35:19", "middle of night that still happens I", "35:21", "still don't sleep too well hyper", "35:23", "vigilance I mean out in public too many", "35:26", "people around you know like you here", "35:28", "with vets and I was aware of that as a", "35:30", "symptom and I felt at first when we were", "35:33", "out in public in Nairobi and I turned to", "35:34", "this FBI psychologist who was with me", "35:37", "and I said you know am i hyper vigilant", "35:39", "he said maybe then I said are you here", "35:43", "because you know I might have PTSD he", "35:45", "said we don't like to put a label on", "35:47", "anything and that was his attitude", "35:49", "towards me that was the tack he took and", "35:52", "in my case at least it was right", "35:54", "eventually he said I said shouldn't I be", "35:57", "treated for PTSD or shouldn't I be going", "35:59", "to regular talk therapy or something", "36:00", "like that and he said you know you don't", "36:02", "want to pathologize anything mm-hmm in", "36:04", "other words you don't want to create", "36:05", "mentally another condition for you for", "36:08", "you to recover from you know it's enough", "36:09", "work for your mind and your body to", "36:11", "recover quite naturally they know how to", "36:13", "do it from all that trauma that's very", "36:17", "interesting because I've heard people", "36:18", "talk about that with other things", "36:20", "particularly with war that you're you're", "36:23", "better off not deciding what you have or", "36:27", "not being told what you have mhm", "36:29", "in my case that's true I mean who knows", "36:32", "I think PTSD can be so complicated", "36:34", "they're you know they're pharmaceutical", "36:37", "solutions yeah that kind of thing for", "36:38", "some people the body and mind know how", "36:41", "to recover so you have to eat you have", "36:43", "to let them do they give you techniques", "36:46", "to recover as in instead of explaining", "36:49", "or discussing what the issue is do they", "36:52", "give you techniques to feel better or to", "36:55", "establish more normal", "36:57", "existence I know I mean I didn't get a", "37:00", "checklist but the psychologist would say", "37:02", "you know if something's bothering you", "37:03", "write it down but he knew I was a writer", "37:07", "he they made sure they knew that I had a", "37:10", "loving family around me when I got back", "37:12", "and a great circle of friends in Berlin", "37:14", "that's really important I think", "37:18", "everybody finds their own way I mean I I", "37:20", "knew I was weak I mean I was just", "37:22", "physically like a wraith you know when I", "37:24", "got out how much weight did you lose", "37:26", "no I lost about 40 pounds and when I", "37:31", "when I first came out and walked around", "37:34", "in Berlin Berlin's a walking City so I", "37:35", "tried to lead like a normal day my knees", "37:40", "swelled up and my ankle swelled up and", "37:42", "they were really painful so I was

transcribed", "43:08", "them yeah so that was also sort of blood", "43:11", "and sweat", "43:13", "the research was blood sweat and tears", "43:15", "and so was the writing but I did know at", "43:19", "least this the facts of the story so I", "43:23", "put those down first and then we went", "43:26", "back and did how it felt so the putting", "43:30", "everything down which a writer likes to", "43:32", "do you know all at once and one sort of", "43:34", "great act of creation that would that", "43:37", "would have been a little overwhelming so", "43:39", "I did it in layers and that

forgive which was you", "44:19", "know not an easy process and it's", "44:21", "something but I think it's something", "44:23", "very essential how so how did you learn", "44:26", "to forgive so we talked about picking up", "44:29", "a Kalashnikov I was gonna do that I", "44:31", "thought about doing that and it was an", "44:34", "internal debate for really long time", "44:36", "until one point where I actually heard", "44:39", "something on the radio from the Pope the", "44:41", "new pope", "44:42", "I'd never you know even seen before and", "44:45", "he gave a very good homily about what", "44:48", "forgiveness meant and that resonated and", "44:50", "at some point I made a conscious", "44:52", "decision to forgive the guards who were", "44:53", "around me you know these are the law", "44:55", "lowest-ranking guys but they were making", "44:57", "my life miserable and I made a conscious", "45:00", "decision to forgive them and I had to do", "45:04", "that over and over and that made my mind", "45:07", "a whole lot more more stable and so", "45:10", "settled which means that unless I had", "45:13", "done that I probably would have picked", "45:15", "up a gun and killed myself if not them", "45:17", "or both that's fascinating that a speech", "45:21", "by the Pope could resonate so strongly", "45:23", "with you while you're in captivity mhm", "45:26", "just forgiveness forgiveness it wouldn't", "45:30", "have had to be by the Pope but he was", "45:31", "pretty good that's something that people", "45:33", "play pay lip service to and you know you", "45:36", "hear people saying you should live a", "45:38", "life of forgiveness and it's healthier", "45:40", "for you but no one can really understand", "45:43", "that the way you have for me it was life", "45:45", "and death Wow", "45:48", "and it's I mean I can't wait to read", "45:50", "your book this is a crazy story your", "45:55", "don't mean this it's just such an insane", "45:58", "experience was that you're you're just", "46:02", "you're well of experiences like what you", "46:07", "can draw upon is so different from most", "46:10", "people that you're interacting with you", "46:11", "must almost feel like you're going", "46:13", "through life interacting with privileged", "46:15", "children sometimes but the so first of", "46:19", "all which is very happy to be back in", "46:21", "yeah in the world I grew up in so that's", "46:24", "the main thing", "46:25", "um but yeah that comes up sometimes you", "46:27", "know when people complain about things", "46:29", "for example oh it's so fucking horror", "46:32", "right or you know you should try hot in", "46:36", "Somalia prison where you're shackled to", "46:38", "a bed right exactly yeah we're you know", "46:41", "idiots in traffic

obviously she was on my", "47:01", "mind and all my friends and family were", "47:03", "on my mind while it was in Somalia and", "47:05", "just to see somebody that I'd been", "47:06", "thinking about all this time in a sort", "47:08", "of hypothetical way again in you know", "47:12", "real life and the way that I really", "47:14", "thought I wouldn't overwhelming it was", "47:17", "really really fantastic now had you gone", "47:21", "to dangerous places for journalism", "47:23", "before", "47:24", "yes Amalia yeah where'd you gone so for", "47:26", "the my second book sweetness and blood I", "47:29", "surfed in Gaza Wow and I'd been to", "47:33", "northern Iraq and some other places but", "47:36", "this was easily the most dangerous what", "47:37", "did you do in Gaza I went to see the", "47:40", "Gaza surf club and I actually went", "47:42", "surfing with him the Gaza surf club this", "47:45", "exists what is that", "47:48", "so it's a group of Palestinians who like", "47:51", "to surf but who don't have enough", "47:52", "surfboards and so they organized into a", "47:56", "club first to share a couple of", "47:58", "surfboards that they had found and", "48:00", "managed to manage to buy and also to", "48:04", "receive donations from a group of", "48:06", "surfers in Tel Aviv who thought these", "48:08", "guys should have boards and so their", "48:10", "relationship grew up between a group in", "48:12", "Tel Aviv called surfing for peace and", "48:14", "the Gaza surf club so Jews in Tel Aviv", "48:17", "are donating surfboards to Palestinians", "48:21", "Wow it's completely wonderful it's a", "48:23", "it's a grassroots peace initiative you", "48:26", "know it's been going out for years now", "48:27", "but one of the eloquent things that the", "48:31", "leader of the surfing for peace group", "48:35", "said was you know we're not getting", "48:37", "anywhere on an official level so we", "48:38", "better do something on sort of a", "48:39", "grassroots level I think it's marvelous", "48:41", "Wow", "48:43", "what do you do now oh right so seeking", "48:48", "out danger was never the point you know", "48:50", "I tried not to shrink from it but that", "48:52", "was not you know I'm not a thrill seeker", "48:53", "and that's not the what I'm trying to", "48:56", "base my career on or anything like that", "48:57", "right now I'm writing a novel", "48:59", "so that should keep me seated for a", "49:00", "while what's it about it's about drones", "49:04", "drones oh that doesn't sound peaceful", "49:10", "it's not but I'm not going to say any", "49:13", "more about it", "49:14", "yeah I get it um do you ever anticipate", "49:18", "yourself traveling for journalism again", "49:20", "sure", "49:20", "Oh travel yeah but just nothing like", "49:22", "this yeah no I don't need to do", "49:24", "dangerous travel anytime soon no no yeah", "49:29", "some people just want to jump right back", "49:30", "into the fire", "49:31", "yeah that's not but that was not the", "49:34", "point in the first place right what was", "49:36", "the point what did you hope to get out", "49:38", "of this trip to Somalia well so one one", "49:41", "thing that I noticed while I was", "49:43", "watching the trial in in in Hamburg was", "49:48", "this clash between a modern liberal", "49:51", "state which is what Germany is and so", "49:53", "it's America by the way and an archaic", "49:57", "crime and Germany in fact is newer than", "50:02", "the United States in the sense that its", "50:03", "Constitution was written in 1949 when", "50:05", "nobody was thinking about piracy so the", "50:07", "laws against piracy are extremely", "50:09", "lenient and in German law in a way that", "50:11", "they're not in Spanish or American law", "50:13", "we have laws that date back to when it", "50:16", "was a capital crime and basically the", "50:20", "Germans didn't know how to deal with", "50:20", "these guys and I thought it was", "50:23", "fascinating in the first place that this", "50:25", "ancient crime had revived after a couple", "50:28", "centuries of relative quiet you know and", "50:31", "so I that tension on its own was", "50:34", "interesting and that was worth the book", "50:36", "because nobody was quite approaching it", "50:37", "that way you know so that tension is", "50:42", "still interesting and that tension is", "50:43", "still alive so there are certainly", "50:45", "threats to modern liberal states going", "50:47", "on around the world so what were the", "50:49", "trials in Berlin there was a trial in", "50:51", "Hamburg and I was going back and forth", "50:53", "from Berlin it was ten guys from Somalia", "50:56", "who I tried to hijack a cargo ship that", "50:59", "belonged to a a German ship ship company", "51:04", "and that was based in Hamburg I think", "51:07", "they were overpowered by the Dutch Navy", "51:09", "but the Dutch handed him over to the", "51:11", "Germans", "51:11", "in fact the Dutch said okay we'll do", "51:14", "this as long as we don't have to try", "51:15", "them because everyone knew from the", "51:17", "outset that there was going to be a", "51:19", "problem trying Somalis well in what way", "51:25", "in Europe in general but especially in", "51:28", "Germany I think there's a actually a law", "51:31", "against shipping them back to Somalia", "51:33", "because it's considered not a safe place", "51:36", "for them for them even for them and I", "51:40", "think that's nuts once they were", "51:41", "convicted I think they should have been", "51:42", "deported after they served their -", "51:44", "that's so bizarre but but if they were", "51:46", "shipped back to Somalia how would they", "51:48", "be treated like what is the government", "51:49", "like in Somalia man good question sanely", "51:51", "corrupt I asked some", "51:52", "my parents about that it is corrupt it's", "51:55", "a it's either corrupt or non-existent so", "51:57", "the the government is Somalia is are", "52:00", "focused around Mogadishu and it just", "52:02", "doesn't have that much power and the", "52:03", "provinces and I was in one of the one of", "52:05", "the provinces and because the provinces", "52:07", "don't get a whole lot of money from", "52:09", "Mogadishu so that they run their own", "52:10", "businesses wins in some cases piracy I", "52:14", "asked one of my guards what would happen", "52:16", "if a pirate went and got thrown into", "52:19", "jail in some other country and then came", "52:22", "back and tried to you know set up", "52:24", "friendships again with his old pirate", "52:26", "buddies or whatever you know would he be", "52:29", "killed would he be in in dangerous no no", "52:31", "no problem", "52:32", "they probably let you right back in no", "52:35", "problem yeah yeah I mean is there any", "52:39", "sort of punishment for them when they", "52:41", "get back to Somalia is there any penal", "52:44", "system potentially there is yeah so", "52:47", "that's not considered a crime there are", "52:48", "yes it is so there there are laws on the", "52:52", "books especially in the regions and even", "52:54", "prisons for pirates the problem is that", "52:57", "clan relationships are a lot more", "52:59", "important than newly written laws and so", "53:02", "even pirate to go to jail this was true", "53:05", "about one boss in my case might get out", "53:07", "again so this guy this guy who was a", "53:10", "pirate boss in my case wound up in jail", "53:11", "while I was still captive for one month", "53:14", "in Mogadishu and wound up walking Wow", "53:17", "and he was captive for piracy I think", "53:21", "for having weapons that the government", "53:24", "didn't expect to see in one of his", "53:26", "houses so something off to the side but", "53:30", "it's this really sketchy system of", "53:33", "bartering and payoffs and let's who you", "53:37", "know and who you're related to and the", "53:39", "there are other prisons for you know low", "53:42", "ranking pirates and Puntland and also in", "53:45", "Galkayo where I was it's a crapshoot how", "53:49", "much time those guys are gonna spend in", "53:50", "jail and what happened with the people", "53:53", "in Germany they got a total of seven", "53:57", "years I think or an average in German in", "54:00", "Germany and then what happened when they", "54:02", "were released", "54:03", "nothing Wow yeah that's a whole separate", "54:07", "story which I haven't even you know", "54:09", "started started to address but as it", "54:12", "turned out a few of them went back to", "54:13", "Somalia anyway and probably went right", "54:15", "back into the business uh well or", "54:17", "something else you know illicit or", "54:20", "profitable or whatever yeah and there's", "54:22", "a wide variety of people that they", "54:25", "target right they target people in", "54:27", "individual crafts they target large", "54:30", "boats commercial vessels yep they they", "54:33", "did all of that I mean in fact I met", "54:35", "hostages from all of those you know from", "54:37", "the whole range", "54:38", "so how many hostages did you meet over", "54:40", "the two years and eight months a total", "54:42", "of 30 so the the crew on the fishing", "54:45", "ship the tuna vessel was 28 and then I", "54:48", "met

"relatively big ship the guys from the", "55:14", "Seychelles were from a small private", "55:16", "craft and I was an example of someone", "55:19", "captured on land and these people that", "55:21", "were from the small private craft who", "55:25", "were they trying to get money from just", "55:26", "anyone who knows them is that how they", "55:28", "do this yeah whoever anybody I mean of", "55:32", "course they ask from the government but", "55:33", "the government doesn't always pay you", "55:36", "know the given government yeah just it's", "55:39", "just the whole system seems so insane", "55:42", "that they've got I mean they keep people", "55:45", "for years and years yeah but they have", "55:47", "just a whole collection of them oh", "55:51", "they're trying to extract money from", "55:52", "people that know them yeah as it turns", "55:55", "out they're not very good at it so", "55:56", "pirates are in the kidnapping business", "55:57", "but they don't always know what they're", "55:59", "doing the the bosses I think got used to", "56:04", "demanding a lot of money from shipping", "56:06", "companies and finding out that if you", "56:08", "hold a ship stubbornly for a long time", "56:10", "you get a lot of money from the", "56:13", "insurance company or whatever", "56:15", "I that that calculation doesn't work", "56:18", "with human beings so in other words", "56:20", "everyone else on earth who negotiates", "56:23", "for a human being expects that the", "56:25", "person's price to go down as the time", "56:27", "you know wears on and it took a while", "56:31", "for pirates to understand that Wow", "56:34", "what is it I mean when you're Dee you're", "56:37", "dealing with all this like what what is", "56:40", "it like on your psyche when
