with", "12:53", "nutritional epidemiology the first is", "12:56", "data collection so there's a saying in", "12:59", "science which is that data are only as", "13:02", "good as the tool used to collect them", "13:04", "all right and in nutritional", "13:07", "observational studies the tool used to", "13:09", "collect data is a questionnaire okay", "13:13", "and so that relies completely on memory", "13:17", "and we know that memory is not a precise", "13:19", "accurate or", "13:20", "representation of events it's more like", "13:22", "a highly edited anecdote of what", "13:24", "happened in the past and a little bit", "13:27", "like the Kavanagh thing going on right", "13:29", "back in that back in the 13th century he", "13:32", "had Francis Bacon who said for something", "13:34", "to be scientific it has to be", "13:36", "independently observable measurable and", "13:38", "falsifiable and then accurate and valid", "13:41", "valid and so let's use an analogy if", "13:45", "you're sitting there eating an apple and", "13:46", "I'm watching you do that I can observe", "13:49", "that you're eating the Apple I can", "13:51", "measure how much of the Apple you eat", "13:53", "and I can confirm or refute that you're", "13:55", "eating the Apple if you tell me that you", "13:57", "were eating an apple 15 years ago or 10", "14:00", "years ago I obviously can't observe that", "14:02", "I obviously can't measure it and I", "14:04", "obviously can't confirm or refute it and", "14:06", "yet our entire foundation of a", "14:08", "nutritional epidemiology is based on", "14:11", "that basically people reporting on what", "14:15", "they ate at some time in the past so you", "14:18", "know how much of a problem is this", "14:19", "there's a guy named Edward Archer who's", "14:21", "done some really interesting studies and", "14:25", "he looked at the N Haines data the", "14:26", "nurses health data which is one of the", "14:29", "longest-running nutrition studies 39", "14:31", "years and he found that the the", "14:34", "self-reported calorie intake in those", "14:37", "studies was either physiologically", "14:39", "implausible or incompatible with life so", "14:42", "the average person in those studies", "14:45", "reported a calorie intake that would not", "14:47", "support an elderly bedridden frail woman", "14:52", "so they just is just inaccurate it's", "14:55", "completely inaccurate and the people who", "14:58", "are most likely to underreport are", "14:59", "people who are overweight and obese so", "15:02", "if you if calories are that much", "15:05", "underreported all nutrition comes", "15:07", "through calories everything we get fat", "15:09", "protein carbohydrates micronutrients", "15:11", "they all come through calories so if", "15:13", "calories are that underreported that", "15:15", "completely invalidates the data set this", "15:18", "is an obesity study so they're", "15:19", "underreported because if she's not an", "15:21", "obesity study it's just every Americans", "15:24", "are overweight and obese the majority of", "15:26", "Americans are overweight and obese so in", "15:28", "any data set of Americans you're going", "15:29", "to have the majority of them overweight", "15:31", "or over B's so or obese so that's the", "15:34", "first", "15:34", "problem the second problem is a healthy", "15:36", "user bias which I know we talked about", "15:38", "before but it's basically the idea that", "15:41", "because you know when someone engages in", "15:44", "an unhealthy and a behavior that's", "15:46", "perceived as unhealthy they are more", "15:48", "likely to engage in other behaviors that", "15:50", "are perceived as unhealthy and", "15:52", "vice-versa", "15:53", "so let's say you do a study of people", "15:56", "who ate eat more red meat well red meat", "15:59", "has been perceived as unhealthy for a", "16:00", "long time and so what we know is that in", "16:02", "those observational studies the people", "16:04", "who eat more red meat are also smoking", "16:07", "more they have higher body mass index", "16:09", "they're eating less fewer fruits and", "16:10", "vegetables they have a lower level of", "16:12", "education they're less physically active", "16:15", "so how do you know that it's the red", "16:16", "meat that's causing the problem and not", "16:19", "those other things you don't because", "16:21", "they cannot control for all of those", "16:22", "potential confounding factors the third", "16:25", "problem with observational research and", "16:27", "maybe the biggest is that the the", "16:31", "relative risks in nutrition are so low", "16:35", "that they're indistinguishable from", "16:36", "chance", "16:37", "so in fields outside of nutrition and", "16:39", "epidemiology nobody would consider a", "16:43", "relative risk an increase in risk less", "16:46", "than a hundred percent a doubling to be", "16:48", "really worth paying attention to so to", "16:51", "put this in perspective the", "16:53", "observational studies that Joel was", "16:55", "referring to that confirm that is that", "16:58", "cigarette smoking led to lung cancer", "17:00", "that children between a 1,000 and 3,000", "17:04", "percent increase in lung cancer in", "17:08", "smokers okay and the studies that have", "17:12", "shown that eating aflatoxin which is a", "17:14", "mycotoxin increased liver cancer risk", "17:17", "that's 600 percent increase okay the aya", "17:20", "the IAR see the w-h-o report that", "17:24", "suggested that process red meat was a", "17:25", "carcinogen that was 18% increase most", "17:30", "epidemiologists you talked to will say", "17:32", "that is so low that it's really in the", "17:35", "student indistinguishable from chance", "17:37", "especially given the healthy user bias", "17:39", "and the problems with the data", "17:40", "collection that I mentioned before so", "17:42", "the studies that are cited so when", "17:44", "people are talking about red meat causes", "17:46", "cancer they're literally", "17:48", "talking about something that showed an", "17:49", "18% increase yeah", "17:51", "and this is over people that are also", "17:54", "spending sugar so what that translates", "17:56", "into four and a half there were four and", "17:58", "a half cases of cancer out of a hundred", "18:00", "and people with no lowest intake of", "18:03", "processed meat and that went up to 5.3", "18:06", "cases out of a hundred in people with", "18:08", "the highest intake of processed meat so", "18:11", "you
