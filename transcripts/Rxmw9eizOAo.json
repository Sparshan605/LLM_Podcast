thing is there was a", "96:49", "long period of my life when I I did a", "96:51", "lot of scuba diving and I was looking at", "96:53", "at underwater structures and one of the", "96:54", "sites had

don't care whether the Bimini Road is", "97:06", "natural or man-made for me the mystery", "97:08", "is that it is shown above water on that", "97:11", "map and the last time it was above water",

at I mean", "97:38", "that looks so man-made and and you can", "97:40", "see it is rather like the the pattern", "97:43", "that's shown on the on the island in the", "97:44", "in the map how deep is that today oh", "97:46", "it's not very deep it's about 20 feet", "97:47", "there's but we think that that was above", "97:50", "water", "97:51", "obviously was definitely above water", "97:52",

"on the Bimini Road I can tell you I", "98:25", "absolutely do not think it's natural I", "98:27", "think it's a man-made structure but the", "98:29", "argument is that it's a kind of beach", "98:30", "rock that forms in these blocky", "98:32", "formations as beach rock does form in", "98:35", "Bakke formation but here I believe that", "98:36", "the beach rock has been used as a", "98:38",

"98:49", "and that is a dating project that tells", "98:51", "us that somebody was mapping that bit of", "98:53", "the world when it was above water and go", "98:56", "back that takes us back a very long a", "98:58", "long way into the past though the one", "99:00", "that you just pulled up you know look at", "99:01", "that one it's a stunning place it's", "99:03", "animate this amazing site it's just like", "99:04", "the odds of that being in that order", "99:07", "with those uniformly sized rocks for how", "99:10", "long is that Oh hundreds of feet it's a", "99:13", "huge it's actually shaped like a letter", "99:14", "J it's a giant underwater structure it's", "99:17", "really really an enormous thing and very", "99:19", "very beautiful to dive on and there's", "99:20", "lots of very gentle sweet nurse sharks", "99:22", "down there that you can play with this", "99:23", "so that looks much more like random", "99:25", "that's more random a bit a bit bit of it", "99:27", "do look more random mmm and bits of it", "99:29", "look highly constructed I would not I", "99:32", "would not seek to to claim that the", "99:35", "Bimini Road is absolutely man-made mine", "99:37", "claim about the Bimini Road is it's", "99:39", "really fucking weird that it appears on", "99:40", "a map above water yeah a map that was", "99:43", "drawn in 1513 based on older source map", "99:45", "now when they found that ancient Greek", "99:49", "computer thing and what is our mechanism", "99:53", "yes yeah again that testifies to a lost", "99:57", "navigational skill that we have not", "99:59", "taken account of it's incredibly complex", "100:02", "and it took a long time for them", "100:03", "figure out what that even is yeah what", "100:05", "do they think that is now it

times I'm", "100:24", "guessing here because Greek times are", "100:27", "not of great interest to me but I'm", "100:28", "thinking around about 500 BC so at least", "100:32", "2,000 years old 2,000
