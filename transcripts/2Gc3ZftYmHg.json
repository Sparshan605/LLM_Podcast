"00:45", "we're wrong that totally what science is", "00:47", "if we knew what the answer was we", "00:49", "wouldn't look into it like what's the", "00:51", "point of doing a study if we know the",

"01:00", "nutrition you take training the vast", "01:02", "majority of those things are similar to", "01:04", "what they were twenty thirty eighty a", "01:06", "hundred years ago so the bulk of it what", "01:09", "matters for the bulk of athletes is", "01:11", "fairly standard what where differs is", "01:14", "the last few percentage points it's", "01:16", "getting us that last ten percent gains", "01:18", "or being very specific so you on a", "01:20", "personal level need this little bit of", "01:22", "difference and then you need this tiny", "01:23", "bit of difference but the bulk of it", "01:25", "really is not that different well when", "01:27", "you're watching MMA fighters in", "01:30", "particular you see so many different", "01:32", "methods means so many different ways to",

works", "02:05", "for somebody at a very high level is not", "02:07", "necessarily going to work for the bulk", "02:08", "of people and particular if like the", "02:11", "great example is

the context", "02:46", "of recovery the nutrition has all the", "02:48", "other stresses that are eliminated from", "02:50", "his life all of that change is what's", "02:51", "gonna work or not work for you now", "02:53", "there's a bunch of different ways of", "02:55", "approaching things like I've always been", "02:57", "fascinated by the Marva Marinovich", "02:59", "method and now Nick curse on takes that", "03:02", "method as well and their idea is that", "03:04", "strength and conditioning is especially", "03:06", "when the fighters in camp is more", "03:08", "important than anything more important", "03:10", "even in skill work right because you", "03:12", "already know how to fight so the", "03:13", "strength and conditioning should take", "03:15", "precedent get all that done too so get", "03:17", "your body to the point where you have", "03:19", "the most horsepower the biggest gas tank", "03:21", "the best tires you know the best", "03:23", "handling and then you already know how", "03:26", "to fight so just approach it that way", "03:28", "yeah so the the guy that actually", "03:30", "trained Marv Michael yes this is a", "03:32", "fullerton guy oh it's Cal State", "03:34", "Fullerton so he was the the cyclist yes", "03:36", "yeah that's his name yeah why ESS", "03:38", "Russian name uh he's awesome he's like", "03:40", "85 now or something and if you want to", "03:42", "get massively entertained by somebody", "03:44", "like he's a good one yeah because he's", "03:46", "just very opinionated but nonetheless uh", "03:49", "yeah that is I think an important one if", "03:51", "you look at Joel Jameson a friend of", "03:53", "mine who trains Demetrius Johnson like", "03:55", "all those guys they have very different", "03:57", "approaches and I don't I think the", "03:59", "massive fallacies actually goes back to", "04:00", "your original question is thinking that", "04:01", "there is one single answer that's the", "04:04", "problem", "04:05", "right whether we're talking training", "04:07", "nutrition recovery ice with any of these", "04:09", "modalities the the major reason we have", "04:12", "so much internet fighting between", "04:13", "experts and why it makes it so difficult", "04:14", "for so many people to figure out like", "04:16", "well what's the right answer is because", "04:17", "searching for a right answer is the", "04:19", "problem to begin with we're having the", "04:20", "wrong conversation with all of this crap", "04:22", "it's not the right place to go so those", "04:25", "are two very different approaches", "04:27", "for Demetrius they reduce a lot of the", "04:29", "strength conditioning they do during", "04:31", "camp because they want to get very good", "04:32", "with the train with the fighting so all", "04:35", "that stuff is gone", "04:36", "so Joel believes in training as much as", "04:38", "we can prior to camp and then in camp", "04:41", "it's time to get better at fighting hmm", "04:43", "someone like Nick is apparently has the", "04:45", "opposite approach yeah I don't think", "04:48", "that either one of them is more or", "04:49", "letter less effective than the other it", "04:52", "really comes down to the combination of", "04:54", "coaches as well as the athlete so some", "04:56", "athletes in them and you could attest to", "04:58", "this and I've seen this a bunch of times", "04:59", "if they're two days out three days out a", "05:02", "week out some of them get really anxious", "05:04", "if they don't get to practice this skill", "05:06", "like I want to be really sharp with my", "05:08", "combinations I want to be really good", "05:09", "with my transitions etc and if you take", "05:11", "that away from them they get very", "05:12", "anxious and they don't like it and so", "05:15", "you almost have to do is program it", "05:17", "based on this combination of physiology", "05:20", "and psychology and that's a bit outside", "05:22", "of my realm but this is what makes", "05:24", "coaching so complicated is saying okay", "05:27", "well you know what for you athlete one", "05:30", "you're gonna do the opposite approach", "05:31", "athlete two you're gonna be doing the", "05:33", "other approach because you just don't", "05:35", "feel as good you're not as confident", "05:36", "you're not filming the smoothin and more", "05:37", "than anything when they walk down to", "05:39", "that cage or particularly two or three", "05:41", "days before they have to feel amazing", "05:43", "yeah you have to have that combination", "05:45", "yeah it is weird that like there is no", "05:48", "answer no you know like there was one", "05:51", "like a Mark Hunt is gonna have a", "05:53", "completely different set of requirements", "05:54", "than you know Derrick Lewis or Mighty", "05:58", "Mouse Johnson or anybody it's so like", "06:00", "everybody's got different needs and and", "06:02", "everybody's coming to the table with a", "06:04", "different set of skills and a different", "06:06", "set of problems especially when you look", "06:07", "at experience too so what worked for you", "06:09", "when your second fight when you were 20", "06:11", "is maybe not the same approach you have", "06:12", "to take when you're 30 hmm I just I just", "06:15", "got back from New York I was in the last", "06:17", "three days and I was with one of my guys", "06:18", "Dennis Bermudez and we had this", "06:20", "conversation and when I first started", "06:23", "working with him we had to take a very", "06:25", "different approach the week of and", "06:27", "especially even you know the hour before", "06:29", "the fight because the way that he got", "06:30", "ramped up for a fight is very different", "06:32", "than some other people that I've worked", "06:33", "with what we had to realize and I", "06:36", "remember he called me right after one of", "06:39", "his recent fights maybe", "06:40", "or five fights ago and he's like I'm", "06:41", "freaking out because I didn't freak out", "06:43", "in the cage this time I was like what", "06:45", "he's like you know I'm usually like", "06:47", "really freaked out in the cage and this", "06:48", "is what drives my performance but this", "06:50", "time I was really calm and collected I", "06:51", "saw everything and I'm nervous that I'm", "06:53", "not nervous enough so I had to get him", "06:56", "in with my good friend Lennie we're", "06:57", "Somozas sports psychologist who works a", "07:00", "lot of combat sport athletes and say", "07:01", "okay we need to get you in a place of", "07:02", "optimal arousal because if you're under", "07:04", "aroused that's a problem but if you're", "07:05", "over aroused that's a problem as well so", "07:07", "we had to change the tactics a little", "07:08", "bit between everything from his walk", "07:10", "down to the week of before the cueing", "07:12", "the things that we say to him to make", "07:14", "sure he's in an optimal state every", "07:17", "other out that he worked like all those", "07:18", "approaches are completely different we", "07:20", "can't have the same thing how do you", "07:21", "train a guy to do is walk down oh", "07:24", "there's a lot we can do really oh yeah", "07:27", "and I'm not sports psychologist sole all", "07:29", "right go to why do you know what they do", "07:31", "absolutely everything from breathing", "07:33", "drills right to the the cueing the words", "07:35", "you use so for example in the back if", "07:38", "you're a Dennis Bermudez five years ago", "07:42", "you know Ryan Parsons would have to say", "07:44", "like real vile horrible shit like rip", "07:46", "his fucking head off I want you to bring", "07:47", "it back in a plate like murder him rip", "07:49", "him to shreds that works for some guys", "07:51", "for Dennis at that point at that point", "07:54", "not anymore", "07:55", "right now it's a little bit different", "07:56", "approach and Ryan could tell you the", "07:58", "details of what he does now but some", "07:59", "guys like you tell some other people", "08:01", "that backstage you're gonna be like what", "08:02", "huh like don't don't say that just like", "08:05", "right tell me what to focus on remind me", "08:07", "my cues in my timing and so the guys", "08:08", "that are too ramped up their very", "08:11", "specific breathing drills for example we", "08:12", "can have them do as they're walking down", "08:13", "the cage as they're in the cage", "08:16", "especially if they're the first one down", "08:18", "or the second one down so they're first", "08:20", "down sometimes that's a 10-minute delay", "08:22", "between when they're standing in the", "08:23", "cage and when they actually start", "08:24", "throwing right if you're not taking", "08:26", "advantage of that time or if that time", "08:28", "is getting taken advantage of you that", "08:30", "can have a real problem with your energy", "08:31", "and especially if you get a guy who's", "08:34", "really savvy like a connor or a John", "08:37", "Jones who takes their time coming down", "08:39", "and they mess with you they do different", "08:41", "things on the way down that really", "08:43", "influences what's going on with the guy", "08:45", "in the cage especially if they're less", "08:47", "experienced or maybe touch the underdog", "08:49", "or other things like that so that can", "08:51", "all be be messed with now a guy like", "08:53", "Dennis Bermudez", "08:54", "is a good example right you were you're", "08:56", "working with him he's obviously a", "08:57", "world-class fighter yeah but he always", "08:59", "seems to fall just short on these big", "09:02", "fights yeah", "09:04", "there's you know this is where it's", "09:05", "outside of my expertise I'm a muscle", "09:07", "physiologist not a psychologist", "09:09", "right but with his last performance so", "09:11", "there's against Darren Elkins yeah who", "09:12", "was a really tough guy", "09:14", "very awkward really just blood and guts", "09:17", "type of fighter but that was a good", "09:18", "matchup for a very good fight good", "09:20", "matchup skill wise it should on paper", "09:22", "something a good match should have", "09:23", "favored Dennis in a lot of races well", "09:25", "there's no way to beat around that I", "09:26", "feel like two things are happening in", "09:28", "that fight one", "09:29", "I feel like Darren Elkins is getting", "09:31", "better for sure and he was very super", "09:33", "motivated and energized by his", "09:36", "performance over Mirsad BEC dick which", "09:38", "is an amazing comeback that's incredible", "09:40", "crazy yeah so but a lot of people felt", "09:44", "like he was the favorite that Dennis was", "09:46", "the favorite going into that fight yeah", "09:48", "on paper", "09:49", "clearly he was from a lot of vantage", "09:51", "points but it's really difficult you", "09:55", "know without telling too much to Dennis", "09:56", "a story for him it was it's quite funny", "09:59", "what happens with the gameplan sometimes", "10:01", "and what happens when they get in there", "10:02", "even with the seasoned guy like Dennis", "10:03", "and I don't know if a part of that was", "10:05", "because it was in New York and Dennis's", "10:07", "hometown or if that was because of Pat", "10:09", "who was good friend fought right before", "10:12", "and want to really you know crazy fight", "10:13", "in the fight before if he saw that you", "10:16", "just don't know what goes in and then", "10:17", "you know sometimes like in the middle of", "10:19", "a fight you're like the fights over and", "10:21", "I don't even know why we did that I", "10:22", "could just we got to this weird rhythm", "10:23", "thing and we started doing this and that", "10:25", "was I don't know what happened and and", "10:27", "act the rhythm can kind of take over the", "10:29", "fight and Darren fought an amazing fight", "10:31", "he did exactly what he needed to do but", "10:34", "it was just the from my perspective as a", "10:37", "scientist one I try to stay away from", "10:40", "those things that's not my job but it's", "10:42", "it's fun and this is what makes it", "10:43", "exciting for me is why I work with these", "10:45", "folks is because you can have the", "10:46", "perfect camp physically and sometimes", "10:51", "you win sometimes you lose and so then", "10:53", "you go back the drawing board you go", "10:54", "well do we throw everything out do we", "10:55", "try something different", "10:56", "what was it those it's psychological is", "10:59", "it physical that's the thing to think", "11:00", "likely fantastic well what was the", "11:02", "physical game plan like you planned on", "11:04", "you must have planned on knowing how", "11:05", "Darren fights a super high pay", "11:08", "in-your-face type of fight yeah that", "11:10", "that part's not a problem for Dennis he", "11:11", "doesn't really get tired and the vast", "11:13", "majorities fights I mean looked a little", "11:15", "bit like he was getting tired in this", "11:16", "fight uh again he can say that but from", "11:19", "the feedback and from what we saw like", "11:21", "he was like no he just maybe had a hard", "11:24", "time focusing honestly I didn't have and", "11:26", "asked him very specifically what was", "11:28", "going on there I kind of gave them a few", "11:29", "weeks to kind of get through that stuff", "11:31", "when we start going back art let's watch", "11:32", "a tape let's go through it like right", "11:34", "through so I want to be careful not", "11:35", "offending him or or is direct cards like", "11:38", "that but yeah I mean from my vantage it", "11:42", "was like this was not this is not what", "11:45", "we were looking for he should have just", "11:47", "been more active particularly in the", "11:48", "second round which is what really got", "11:50", "him and he saw in the third round once", "11:51", "he kind of got into it Dennis in our", "11:53", "eyes lease was pretty dominated that", "11:55", "round mm-hmm or was at least clearly", "11:56", "ahead yeah we're one in two were not so", "11:59", "good for him but yeah I just potentially", "12:02", "a focus potentially a lot of things", "12:04", "he wasn't nothing physically that", "12:07", "happened him in the fight that he was he", "12:09", "like oh I we didn't prepare for this we", "12:10", "think was gonna happen", "12:11", "this is throwing me off he was just like", "12:13", "I just I just didn't go in the second", "12:15", "round so it's a weird job you have", "12:17", "because you're kind of relying on", "12:19", "someone else to pull the trigger", "12:20", "you're relying on someone else to make", "12:22", "the moves yeah and you could train them", "12:25", "all you want and you can get him in", "12:26", "incredible shape but then you know ready", "12:29", "go they're on autopilot they're they're", "12:31", "doing their own thing especially me", "12:33", "because I'm not the guy who's in", "12:34", "practice all day every day with them", "12:36", "right like I'm not the Nickerson I'm not", "12:38", "seeing them twelve hours a week right", "12:39", "I'm out there I'm just like like Dennis", "12:42", "I won't even see all camp sometimes", "12:43", "because he's in New York and I'm in and", "12:45", "in LA and so it's like so what do you do", "12:49", "you give them a protocol do you give", "12:51", "them a schedule so my role depending on", "12:53", "which fighter I'm with is completely", "12:55", "different so sometimes it's one phone", "12:56", "call the beginning of camp sometimes", "12:59", "it's just like hey this came up what do", "13:00", "you think we should do how do we go", "13:02", "about this sometimes it's a text three", "13:04", "times a day every day for the whole camp", "13:05", "sometimes those phone calls I get I try", "13:07", "to do like this is not my full-time job", "13:09", "like my full-time job is to research", "13:11", "muscle physiology I work with MMA", "13:13", "fighters in combat sport athletes is", "13:15", "because I love it really so it's just", "13:18", "almost like a side job side hobby", "13:21", "yeah yeah if you want to think of it", "13:22", "that way because you know I have my", "13:24", "full-time living I've got multiple labs", "13:26", "to run like this is what I do is publish", "13:28", "research Brian I take biopsies of people", "13:31", "i isolate hundreds tens of thousands of", "13:33", "muscle fibers at this point in my life", "13:34", "and when I can help if I think I can I", "13:37", "will but I try not to I don't work with", "13:40", "general public I'm our lab is different", "13:42", "opener this way most labs that do the", "13:44", "type of muscle research we do are", "13:46", "focused on disease prevention or", "13:48", "treatment right so how do we fight", "13:49", "cancer how do we get people back I'm one", "13:52", "of the few that actually do this on the", "13:53", "other end of the spectrum which is well", "13:54", "let's study optimization like how do we", "13:57", "thrive how do we not just get to 80", "13:58", "years old but how do we kick ass at 80", "14:00", "years old and becoming from the", "14:02", "performance background that I have a my", "14:04", "athletic background", "14:05", "it does make so much sense I didn't come", "14:07", "from martial arts background at all like", "14:09", "I didn't do anything until much later in", "14:12", "life but I once I started paying", "14:14", "attention to MMA I was like there's", "14:17", "something energetically physiologically", "14:19", "far different about the demands of this", "14:21", "sport and it's really exciting and it's", "14:23", "a really complex problem to solve so I", "14:26", "just started helping out chipping in and", "14:27", "then once you get help a couple of", "14:29", "people and they're like this is", "14:30", "fantastic it cetera kind of the ball", "14:32", "gets rolling so right now basically what", "14:34", "I do is think of it like concierge", "14:36", "service if you will like I don't I'm not", "14:38", "like you can't email me for training", "14:40", "program like I don't have an online", "14:41", "website you can buy stuff from right I'm", "14:43", "here like if somebody's like hey I know", "14:45", "a friend who could really need this or", "14:46", "something maybe", "14:47", "so do you coach people for diet as well", "14:49", "do you go through everything with them", "14:51", "yep don't any what they need and and how", "14:53", "do you like how do you decide like what", "14:56", "a person needs so I could say if you", "14:58", "know Darren Elkins came to you then he", "14:59", "might be very different than Jon Jones", "15:01", "like how do you how do you decide what a", "15:03", "person needs so it depends on if they're", "15:05", "local or not blood work is the easy one", "15:08", "but the vast majority of what I do is a", "15:09", "lot of conversation so I spend a lot of", "15:12", "time on phone calls and Skype with them", "15:14", "saying face could walk me through what", "15:16", "have you done where you want how do you", "15:17", "think I can help the number one thing I", "15:19", "do then is say okay do you have who else", "15:21", "on your team does this who's helping you", "15:23", "let's get on a call with them not so", "15:25", "that I can tell them what to do but just", "15:26", "let me know what what your world is like", "15:28", "and then I see if I can add some advice", "15:29", "people try this I can help you track", "15:32", "things I can tell you with my experience", "15:33", "about", "15:34", "I've seen this happened before or I know", "15:37", "someone that's happening before this is", "15:39", "what happened with the best example was", "15:41", "do you remember last summer at the Rio", "15:43", "Olympics when that Helen marilla's won", "15:46", "the gold medal the first American ever", "15:48", "female to win gold and wrestling no I", "15:51", "wasn't paying attention", "15:52", "Oh Joe go

what", "16:35", "happened was resting is this really", "16:37", "weird thing where World Championships is", "16:39", "a different weight classes than the", "16:41", "Olympics so she was a world champion at", "16:44", "55 kilos and either had to go up to 58", "16:47", "kilos for the Olympics which had a", "16:49", "three-time defending gold medalist in a", "16:51", "15 time straight world

a big deal but", "17:04", "when you're already like scraping to get", "17:06", "there right and so she had to make the", "17:08", "decision to go up or go down and what", "17:11", "happened was she had a nutritionist Eric", "17:13", "revela who you may know Eric he works at", "17:14", "Barnett", "17:15", "he's been around Josh big huge dude okay", "17:17", "wrestler but Eric was for nutritionists", "17:20", "and Eric reached out to me because he's", "17:21", "write down where we're at and Helens", "17:22", "down here and he was basically like I", "17:25", "know what I'm doing obviously but like", "17:27", "let's get as big a team as possible to", "17:30", "make the right decisions as possible so", "17:31", "that's how I like to work so when a new", "17:34", "person reaches out to me I go like well", "17:35", "who else you have on board don't fire", "17:37", "them I don't want anybody get fired", "17:38", "let's all put our heads together because", "17:40", "with MMA specifically they're not making", "17:43", "any income Olympic wrestlers are the", "17:46", "same thing she makes like 15 grand a", "17:47", "year", "17:48", "or something like she's poor so it's",

doesn't", "17:59", "matter if anyone knows what I do with", "18:01", "her or not or anybody I don't care if", "18:02", "you get the credit another nutritionist", "18:04", "gets the credit if you want to actually", "18:05", "help these professional athletes you", "18:07", "have to let your ego go completely out", "18:09", "the door and say why throw people out", "18:11", "let's take every information I have", "18:13", "about everything you've ever done and", "18:15", "come together with solutions and if", "18:17", "somebody else has an idea that you don't", "18:18", "like that's up to you to figure out and", "18:20", "give it to the athlete okay so would you", "18:21", "find out with her like what was the what", "18:23", "was the issue and how'd you get her to", "18:24", "lose the extra so Alex it was like a", "18:26", "year of issues here yeah I mean like", "18:29", "every day every week every month", "18:31", "something else came up so it was like we", "18:33", "tackle this problem and then we had", "18:34", "another problem iron was a huge one for", "18:36", "her iron essen deficiency and we had she", "18:39", "was basically almost flatlined on her", "18:41", "iron worked anemic mm-hmm and we had to", "18:44", "come in and go okay well we're gonna add", "18:45", "this but she was also traveling to", "18:47", "Mongolia she was going internationally", "18:48", "so she kept getting sick Mongolia yeah", "18:51", "for tournaments cuz she had to qualify", "18:52", "the spot damn", "18:53", "and she's cutting she's imagine", "18:55", "wrestling a Mongolian chick it's", "18:56", "terrifying when you're at world", "18:58", "champions not that terrifying they're", "19:00", "hardcore though yeah shit out of me", "19:02", "so she we had to put her on we had to", "19:06", "basically play a game of saying if we", "19:08", "give you the things that keep you from", "19:09", "not being sick that's also the stuff", "19:11", "that actually harms iron absorption keep", "19:14", "you to things like vitamin C for vitamin", "19:17", "C to keep you from getting sick right so", "19:20", "that can help you talking about while", "19:21", "she's dehydrating so we're saying", "19:23", "anytime so if you're gonna go travel", "19:24", "internationally for a long time you can", "19:26", "take a big bowls of vitamin C and it may", "19:27", "help you from getting sick from getting", "19:29", "cold really does that really affect it", "19:31", "better than probiotics do well", "19:33", "probiotics we're on that - mm-hmm", "19:35", "but the point was if you're gonna go on", "19:36", "like a two-week thing to Eastern Europe", "19:38", "I'm gonna give you every advantage", "19:39", "possible that not probably get a cold", "19:41", "right but when wouldn't you do that on a", "19:43", "regular basis like why would you", "19:44", "accentuate the diet traveling trip and", "19:47", "give it some stuff that I mean wouldn't", "19:49", "you want that boost everywhere so the", "19:52", "probiotics are basically a no-brainer", "19:54", "all the time but I mean even though I", "19:55", "don't see everything else yeah but you", "19:56", "have to be careful because any time you", "19:58", "go with the vitamin specifically you", "20:00", "have potential toxicity in vitamin C", "20:03", "absolutely really yeah what what's the", "20:06", "toxicity rate of vitamin C it's not", "20:08", "gonna actually well put it this way at", "20:10", "generally any time you're getting a", "20:12", "vitamin from a food source", "20:14", "you're probably nowhere near toxicity", "20:16", "level so natural consumption of food", "20:18", "you're not going to be in a problem you", "20:19", "start taking three five six grams of", "20:21", "vitamin C at a time you're potentially", "20:24", "going to have problems and it's a whole", "20:25", "host and what makes it really", "20:26", "complicated is there's interaction with", "20:29", "other vitamins and minerals so the iron", "20:30", "for example if you give them with", "20:32", "vitamin C it's gonna help absorption but", "20:34", "zinc is gonna do the opposite and so if", "20:37", "you do these other combinations", "20:38", "you're gonna potentially have problems", "20:40", "or you're potentially safe and so you", "20:41", "say the opposite what does that mean do", "20:43", "you mean zinc doesn't help vitamin C", "20:45", "absorption or doesn't help iron", "20:47", "absorption iron so zinc actually messes", "20:50", "up your iron absorption anytime you have", "20:52", "an avid vitamin or mineral you have", "20:54", "potential either Co absorption or you", "20:56", "have confliction so you're gonna you", "20:58", "know cut things off how does Inc", "21:00", "conflict with the iron I don't know the", "21:02", "chemistry behind it that's weird", "21:03", "yeah do you have a lot of that I mean", "21:05", "you look up basically vitamin A vitamin", "21:06", "D vitamin K magnesium vitamin K Pabon", "21:09", "absorption so you have to make sure that", "21:11", "it let's say if you're eating one at", "21:13", "breakfast eat another one it launches at", "21:14", "how well if you get it from food you're", "21:16", "basically safe right like we don't", "21:17", "really this is stuff we don't worry", "21:19", "about even if you supplement like during", "21:21", "your lunch or during your breakfast yeah", "21:22", "this is what the general answer is don't", "21:24", "supplement with vitamins and minerals", "21:25", "unless you have a very specific reason", "21:27", "right like and we did that for the vast", "21:29", "majority camp but she was continually", "21:31", "getting sick because of a variety of", "21:33", "reasons some that I probably you know", "21:35", "shouldn't say but so we're like okay", "21:38", "fine we addressed that and then it was", "21:40", "like okay now you're super anemic so", "21:41", "let's get away from that but what we did", "21:44", "basically is get iron back to a decent", "21:46", "level as soon as possible and then go", "21:48", "off of everything go right back to food", "21:50", "how are you feeling and that one her she", "21:52", "was so low on iron as soon as we got her", "21:55", "a decent level like within days it was", "21:57", "just like tears of joy of like I feel so", "21:59", "much better I'm not large and not", "22:01", "sleeping all the time but it was", "22:02", "continual the hard part with her was", "22:04", "getting her down and then you would be", "22:05", "shocked what the food was like in Rio", "22:08", "like what they do oh yeah at the", "22:10", "Olympics oh my god like they told them", "22:13", "you'd have ABCD in", "22:14", "get down there and she called me the", "22:15", "first day and she's like they have", "22:18", "nothing we've got McDonald's we've got", "22:19", "popcorn and cookies like there's nothing", "22:21", "down here Wow she's like fire limpet Oh", "22:24", "horrible I mean the basketball players", "22:27", "probably had something but like she's a", "22:29", "wrestler she didn't have anything so", "22:30", "they they had better food for the more", "22:33", "prominent sports probably probably", "22:35", "because they probably brought their own", "22:36", "chefs yeah okay all right so she's", "22:39", "dealing with the team and then she had", "22:40", "to be shipped out of Rio to some other", "22:42", "city two hours away or an hour away or", "22:44", "something and she's like there's no", "22:45", "grocery store here I can't even walk to", "22:47", "the store to get any anything decent so", "22:50", "we had real problems she was about to do", "22:53", "opening ceremonies and we had a plan you", "22:57", "know for a food like basically we're", "22:58", "going hour by hour how do you feel like", "22:59", "where we at these types of things and", "23:01", "she wanted to opening ceremonies and she", "23:03", "called me she's like I want to do", "23:04", "opening ceremonies like fine cool no", "23:06", "problem this is what I want you to eat", "23:08", "and whatever it was and we'll do next", "23:10", "and she's like I'm right next to Michael", "23:11", "Phelps I'm in the front like I don't", "23:12", "want to get out of line I don't go back", "23:14", "out and eat cuz I don't lose my spot", "23:15", "next to Phelps in the front I'm like", "23:16", "okay fine well she is supposed to eat", "23:19", "whatever vegetable and food and fat", "23:21", "source we had I don't remember but she's", "23:23", "like all they have is cookies at popcorn", "23:25", "he's like I guess is just like starve", "23:27", "and we actually that was one time we", "23:30", "didn't do we didn't want to do that", "23:31", "because she was at a problem where she", "23:33", "was so calorically underserved for so", "23:35", "long she or her body would crash quite", "23:38", "often so we had to keep her nutrients", "23:40", "really really really high her vitamins", "23:42", "and minerals to keep her at a low", "23:43", "calorie count but her body not freaking", "23:45", "out", "23:46", "so she was like what do i do not eat and", "23:48", "we had to actually go to the popcorn", "23:49", "because the good fat and there that the", "23:51", "butter that I had to keep her from not", "23:53", "feeling terrible surprise did good for", "23:56", "popcorn for nutrition at the Olympics", "23:58", "and she was there for like six hours", "23:59", "they're supposed to be there for like an", "24:00", "hour and go in just it was a shit show", "24:02", "that's a mess now what about other", "24:04", "athletes like I mean forget about the", "24:05", "specific requirements if someone has to", "24:07", "lose a ton of weight yeah now when you", "24:09", "when you deal with most athletes like", "24:11", "what what what kind of like strength and", "24:14", "conditioning protocols do you have the", "24:16", "mom what kind of recovery protocols like", "24:18", "you're using cryotherapy or sauna like", "24:20", "what kind of stuff you're using so all", "24:22", "that is again I think the problem is", "24:24", "thinking that there is one answer there", "24:25", "I don't have any athletes that I'm like", "24:27", "this is what we", "24:27", "do hey this is our method this is that I", "24:30", "think it's generally a terrible approach", "24:31", "it's combination of where that who are", "24:34", "they with what are they done what's", "24:35", "their past history what do they like are", "24:37", "they not like what do we really need to", "24:38", "get so I try to identify what's", "24:40", "compromising their performance let's", "24:42", "pick the best solution for that issue so", "24:45", "you show up and you're like your problem", "24:46", "is agility your footwork you're just too", "24:48", "slow on your feet well we're gonna have", "24:50", "a different approach your training then", "24:51", "when someone says you're getting out", "24:52", "strenght you're getting out strength", "24:54", "here like someone's pushing around too", "24:56", "much I don't need to rebuild your feet I", "24:58", "don't need to improve your maximal speed", "25:00", "because you're already the fastest in", "25:01", "the division maybe your strength is your", "25:03", "issue so do you do a bunch of tests on", "25:05", "them when they come to you and then you", "25:07", "tried it like what kind of test you do", "25:08", "so we have an entire Center for sport", "25:10", "performance we've got six or eight", "25:12", "Laboratories in it with a whole host of", "25:14", "equipment to do the thing we put the", "25:16", "mask on them make them run field - max", "25:18", "yeah yeah if we need does that do so we", "25:20", "can actually measure the amount of", "25:21", "oxygen and carbon dioxide coming in and", "25:23", "out of the body which allows us to get a", "25:25", "number called the vo2 max which is the", "25:26", "maximum amount of oxygen that you bring", "25:28", "in and exhale so it tells us basically", "25:31", "your your maximal cardiovascular", "25:32", "capacity and it's pseudo important for", "25:35", "MMA so the average person's like at 4045", "25:39", "just to give you some context that", "25:41", "number anyone passed about 60 if you", "25:44", "continue to go up it's not gonna really", "25:46", "make you fight any better so that's one", "25:48", "of the things that we did we found doing", "25:49", "all the research on that MMA folks is if", "25:51", "I take Horn of diminishing return being", "25:53", "around 60 so if you show up and you're a", "25:56", "Jake Ellenberger and you're at 52 and I", "25:59", "can get you to 58 then that's gonna help", "26:01", "your performance a lot but when you show", "26:03", "up in your pack Cummins and you're 66", "26:04", "and I get you to 69 that's not gonna", "26:06", "make you fight any better right that's", "26:07", "not your problem what makes you lose in", "26:09", "a fight is other things that you need to", "26:11", "spend that precious training time on so", "26:13", "when you get a guy or a girl and you", "26:16", "have them in your studio and you start", "26:18", "work like what's like the first thing", "26:19", "you do with them so it would honestly", "26:21", "the first thing would be well what did", "26:23", "the manager or why do they reach out to", "26:24", "me because usually when they come to me", "26:26", "it's problem fixing they don't come to", "26:27", "me when like hey I've won seven fights", "26:29", "and I feel fantastic right usually it's", "26:31", "this is going on I'm losing because of", "26:32", "this reason that's gotta be frustrating", "26:34", "though because you when someone's losing", "26:36", "the problem is like that's slippery", "26:38", "slope it's hard to catch yourself oh", "26:40", "yeah", "26:40", "yeah well it's it's the game to of like", "26:42", "sometimes they just want another answer", "26:44", "which is not like you just not good", "26:46", "enough right right I'm not telling that", "26:51", "right", "26:52", "okay so we'll all watch the fights of", "26:54", "course talk to their team this so I'll", "26:55", "give you a specific ample example so", "26:57", "they come to me and go hey like I don't", "27:01", "think we're fast enough on the feet this", "27:02", "is a problem okay well we've got force", "27:04", "plates that are the really really", "27:05", "sensitive measurement equipment built", "27:07", "into the ground and we can have them do", "27:09", "a variety of jumping tests moving test", "27:12", "lifting tests force plates how does it", "27:14", "work", "27:15", "so it's a really expensive scale", "27:17", "basically built into the ground and how", "27:19", "big is it they're as big as your laptop", "27:22", "or as big as the table oh so it's fairly", "27:25", "small let's understand Oh as big as the", "27:27", "whole table yeah they can't okay not", "27:29", "ours but we have one that's maybe the", "27:31", "size of I don't know small coffee table", "27:34", "yeah there's two of them back to back", "27:35", "okay", "27:36", "so we can do your right foot on one your", "27:37", "left foot another one so we can test", "27:40", "everything from not only your force", "27:42", "which is like if I'm if I measured your", "27:43", "maximum deadlift I would know how strong", "27:46", "your back isn't your hamstrings your", "27:47", "glutes but how do you produce that force", "27:49", "as the big key so a good example is", "27:53", "years ago we had some fighters come in", "27:55", "and one of them was clearly not fast", "27:57", "enough but he wouldn't believe it so he", "28:00", "was strong but it took him a long time", "28:02", "to produce that force so to give you a", "28:05", "number let's say you could do you could", "28:06", "produce a hundred Newton's of force", "28:08", "right just making the number up and I", "28:11", "produce 200 Newton's of force but if it", "28:13", "took you one second to get there and it", "28:14", "took me a hundred seconds or a half a", "28:16", "second to get there in an MMA fight I", "28:18", "don't have one second right so you don't", "28:20", "have a hundred Newton's of usable force", "28:22", "in your sport know that what's", "28:24", "interesting you just said he didn't", "28:25", "believe it mm-hmm", "28:27", "so he didn't think he was slow no he", "28:28", "thought the problems were other things", "28:30", "what do you think the problems were who", "28:32", "knows coaching like I'm not getting the", "28:34", "right thing stride", "28:36", "you know they had my walkout song wrong", "28:38", "just like so you told them you're slow", "28:40", "dude that was my thing I'm like I don't", "28:43", "think so his coaching staff was like we", "28:45", "think this is a problem well let's put", "28:47", "them on the force plate and let's see", "28:49", "not only how much force you produce", "28:50", "because his strength numbers were high", "28:51", "squatted a lie deadlift it a lot", "28:53", "but the time it took him to produce that", "28:56", "force what's called the rate of forced", "28:58", "development his peak velocity the time", "29:00", "it took him to get to that velocity all", "29:02", "that when I compared him to the other", "29:04", "athletes and NFL players and stuff was", "29:06", "just like off-the-charts bad so it what", "29:09", "exercise do you do to measure that so", "29:11", "now that's a great example so when we", "29:12", "have two individual athletes they come", "29:14", "in so let's say one is the opposite so", "29:16", "one of them is really really really good", "29:17", "at producing fast quickly and the other", "29:20", "one takes a long time so the one that", "29:22", "doesn't produce fast they're forced very", "29:24", "quick we would put them on a drill where", "29:26", "we say okay the goal of your training is", "29:29", "to maximize how quickly you produce", "29:31", "force I don't care how heavy you get but", "29:33", "this is a reactive strength thing this", "29:35", "is a speed thing so you're gonna do", "29:37", "maybe a little bit lighter squats but", "29:40", "you're gonna explode you're gonna", "29:41", "transition out of the bottom you're", "29:42", "gonna bounce you're gonna use momentum", "29:44", "you get a swing you're gonna generate", "29:45", "fast as possible you're not going to go", "29:47", "to maximal strength the other guy we get", "29:50", "the opposite we would take the speed", "29:51", "advantage away from him or her and say", "29:54", "you need to be able to produce more", "29:55", "strength without taking advantage of the", "29:57", "speed and it's basically comes down to", "29:58", "using the muscle for force or the", "30:01", "connective tissue for force and that's", "30:03", "really what we can tease out now how", "30:05", "much of speed and mathletics formance is", "30:08", "genetic and how much of it is what", "30:11", "you've been doing and how much can you", "30:12", "improve yeah so that's a fact we", "30:14", "actually just completed a really cool", "30:16", "study on monozygous twins so monozygous", "30:19", "twins means you're the exact same DNA", "30:21", "so it's sperm went in implanted two", "30:24", "implanted one egg the egg split and you", "30:26", "became identical right and so we found", "30:28", "two twins that were the exact same DNA", "30:30", "yeah but one of them had been doing like", "30:33", "marathons and and nuran stuff for 35", "30:36", "years the other hadn't done anything in", "30:39", "35 years so we had this exact question", "30:41", "how that's crazy", "30:43", "identical DNA one variable different", "30:46", "which is well let's make a huge variable", "30:49", "though one is a super endurance athlete", "30:51", "in the insulin the other one's a lazy", "30:53", "bitch yeah something like that", "30:56", "or maybe studies a lot yeah something uh", "31:00", "I think it was a truck driver Wow it's", "31:02", "so weird that's see that's unusual isn't", "31:05", "it like the don't extremely unusual", "31:06", "these are", "31:07", "kind of share similar interests if not", "31:09", "if their difference theirs their", "31:11", "difference is mild yeah I kind of do", "31:13", "this and you do love it more but so what", "31:15", "are the differences in their body test", "31:16", "so we tested them for everything", "31:18", "cardiovascular stuff vo2 max strength", "31:21", "all these same tests that we do with EMM", "31:22", "fighters muscle biopsies fiber type how", "31:24", "much fast how much slow twitch all the", "31:26", "ones in between what we found was of", "31:29", "course the endurance athlete had higher", "31:31", "vo2 max like no-brainer you you you run", "31:34", "a hundred miles a week for 30 years and", "31:36", "your brother doesn't do anything you're", "31:38", "gonna have a better cardiovascular", "31:39", "system blood pressure cholesterol all", "31:43", "that crap better than that trained", "31:45", "athlete but the strength did not favor", "31:49", "the athlete the muscle quality didn't", "31:52", "favor the athlete the total amount of", "31:54", "muscle didn't favor the athlete the", "31:56", "speed didn't favor the athlete really no", "31:58", "and wanting a craziest part is the fiber", "32:01", "type the trained athlete and his quad", "32:04", "was 90% slow-twitch 10% fast which the", "32:09",

"constantly running their next work now", "32:21", "what that's really weird that the muscle", "32:25", "quality it didn't favor the athlete I", "32:28", "think what it tell I mean what do you", "32:29", "mean by muscle quality when you're", "32:30", "saying this so yeah that's a good", "32:32", "question you can take an ultrasound and", "32:33", "you take an image of the muscle and it", "32:36", "looks at it like a combination of how", "32:37", "much you manage your muscular fat there", "32:39", "is with how much total muscle mass there", "32:42", "is in the size and a bunch of different", "32:44", "things so you get this rough idea of", "32:46", "quality has enough favorite guy who's", "32:49", "exercising constantly well you have to", "32:52", "be careful it's only 1 sub 2 so we don't", "32:56", "know but the one implication could be", "32:59", "that yes endurance running and cycling", "33:02", "is great for you there's a clear health", "33:04", "advantage to that but if that's all you", "33:06", "do for 30 years that's probably not", "33:09", "enough to save the muscle capacity we", "33:12", "know things that are that are actually", "33:13", "going to predict mortality vo2 max leg", "33:16", "strength is one of the most significant", "33:17", "predictors of how long you live leg", "33:19", "strength absolute", "33:21", "how weird well sort of tom platt should", "33:24", "live forever Yeah right some of these", "33:27", "guys at squat 900 now obviously there's", "33:29", "diminishing returns right about 400 and", "33:31", "I take you to 450 you're not living a", "33:32", "day longer right but think about it this", "33:34", "way what's the one of the big reasons", "33:36", "why you go from living by yourself to an", "33:40", "assisted living home can't walk can't", "33:42", "walk yeah can't stand up and the biggest", "33:44", "one that they're actually starting to", "33:46", "look at now is foot speed foot speed why", "33:50", "why if you trip and you're about to fall", "33:53", "and you can't put your foot out and", "33:54", "catch yourself you have to have the foot", "33:57", "speed to get yourself out there but", "33:58", "these strength to stop yourself from", "34:01", "falling that makes sense so balance and", "34:03", "yeah well it's eccentric strength the", "34:05", "ability to block all those forces into", "34:07", "the ground to catch your whole body mass", "34:09", "from falling or the wouldn't it be also", "34:12", "your ability to manipulate your body", "34:14", "like yoga absolutely to be able to", "34:16", "control yourself and awkward positions", "34:18", "and the other thing they see is huge", "34:20", "increases in general just physical", "34:21", "activity when you're stronger so when", "34:23", "you're really really strong in your 70", "34:25", "you're much more likely to go to an", "34:27", "extra yoga class I'll go take the dog", "34:29", "for extra walk I'll go grab the thing", "34:31", "but if I'm super weak and getting off", "34:33", "the toilet is a maximum effort squat mmm", "34:36", "I'm more likely to just keep in my chair", "34:38", "just down the toilet Yeah right wow", "34:41", "that's incredible that there wasn't any", "34:44", "increase in muscle quality so that well", "34:47", "that's also one very specific type of", "34:49", "exercise endurance work when I was a", "34:51", "bodybuilder who knows so that's exactly", "34:54", "the point when you the first I think the", "34:56", "first question you asked when we started", "34:57", "talking was you know what what's the", "34:59", "best type of workout what are we well or", "35:01", "what's the the New Age stuff right", "35:03", "mm-hmm well it goes back to I think", "35:06", "everyone of us would agree if you want", "35:07", "to be as healthy as possible you need to", "35:09", "do a variety of training yeah it can't", "35:12", "just be one modality so if you've only", "35:13", "done yoga your whole life you're", "35:15", "probably gonna have strength problems", "35:16", "your foot speed problems if you've only", "35:18", "run if you've only lifted weights if", "35:20", "you've only exposed yourself to a few of", "35:22", "these stimuli you're probably in a real", "35:24", "problem yeah what we've what we've done", "35:27", "recently actually is expanded that", "35:28", "thinking so my friend Brian Mackenzie", "35:31", "and I have a book that we just came out", "35:33", "a couple weeks ago", "35:34", "on this whole idea called unplugged", "35:36", "where we need to expand past just", "35:39", "lifting and running and think about what", "35:42", "other physiological exposures do we need", "35:45", "that are important for longevity how", "35:48", "well do we do when we're hungry how", "35:50", "about cold", "35:51", "how about thirsty hot how well do we do", "35:54", "yeah", "35:54", "meaning performance wise meaning", "35:56", "everything so like are you manipulating", "35:58", "diet to make people perform better when", "36:01", "they're cold like what are you doing", "36:02", "every combination so if you want to be", "36:05", "able to sustain and perform as well as", "36:07", "we can throughout life we probably need", "36:08", "to be able to handle a bunch of", "36:10", "different challenges you're talking", "36:11", "about longevity now not like necessarily", "36:13", "athletic performance and we'll leave", "36:15", "gladly we would use this under that", "36:17", "umbrella but very very carefully so for", "36:19", "example I would not recommend extensive", "36:21", "fasting and during the middle of a", "36:23", "six-week camp prior to UFC fight right", "36:25", "like this is not at all were saying but", "36:26", "this is something maybe we implement", "36:28", "outside of camp okay so for example we", "36:31", "have somebody who's very very", "36:33", "carbohydrate dependent right and I have", "36:36", "a hard time using fat as a fuel source", "36:38", "okay well maybe in during that six week", "36:41", "camp before you see fight I'm not", "36:42", "messing with a tremendous man we're not", "36:43", "going on a new diet five weeks before a", "36:45", "fight like that's not gonna happen but", "36:46", "maybe oh you got hurt you got you know", "36:48", "you got a extended layoff now we start", "36:50", "to work on that other part of your", "36:51", "physiology so that next camp we've got", "36:54", "more what's called metabolic flexibility", "36:56", "so we have an ability to switch back and", "36:57", "forth before between fuel sources right", "37:00", "so when you're preparing someone for a", "37:01", "very specific event exactly here you're", "37:03", "ramping up for September 12th boom with", "37:06", "this is we have a protocol let's get", "37:08", "ready but then after the fights over", "37:10", "then you might be working on very", "37:12", "specific balancing exercises or that", "37:15", "kind of stuff exactly so", "37:17", "I'm of the belief that during those last", "37:19", "few weeks you need to be very specific", "37:21", "to what you're going to do get on weight", "37:23", "get focus get right all these things but", "37:26", "now if we because if we over specify for", "37:28", "too long we have problems we have this", "37:32", "complex as these fighting up forces", "37:34", "called optimization versus adaptation so", "37:38", "generally when you're optimizing you're", "37:40", "not adapting and vice-versa how's that", "37:42", "work so for example yeah you brought up", "37:45", "ice earlier so we do this stuff", "37:48", "we've done a lot of studies and", "37:50", "published in this area so we're just", "37:53", "learning some of the physiology behind", "37:55", "what's going on with Pais and a lot of", "37:56", "people ask me this like well are you for", "37:58", "ice or proi or against it I don't", "38:00", "understand why we have to be in one side", "38:02", "of camp well there's some there's one", "38:04", "guy who does who doesn't believe in ice", "38:08", "Miesha Tate had him on our podcast", "38:11", "he's like the anti ice guy he's like", "38:14", "saying you shouldn't use ice but I've", "38:15", "looked at some of the PubMed studies and", "38:17", "some of the various things there's a lot", "38:18", "of benefits to ice like I don't", "38:20", "understand why anybody would be anti ice", "38:22", "but it makes sense at all to you know it", "38:24", "totally does and this is a deck where", "38:26", "I'm going anti ice make sense to you or", "38:28", "no it can Ken yeah cuz there is there's", "38:31", "good scientific evidence to show that", "38:32", "there are consequences of the ice as", "38:34", "well again for injury or post-workout", "38:37", "for so it depends on the workout context", "38:40", "okay so we'll go to easy examples so", "38:43", "it's not so vague and like theoretical", "38:45", "post a workout that you try to get", "38:47", "bigger add more muscle mass you don't", "38:49", "want to do that right afterward bingo", "38:51", "yeah and why well because your body has", "38:53", "time to recover and the actual", "38:55", "inflammation yes good for you exactly", "38:57", "yeah it's not good for you it is the", "38:59", "signal to grow right so people have this", "39:02", "really weird thing where they like to", "39:03", "personify your human eye", "39:04", "chemicals and physiology like it doesn't", "39:07", "know it's not good or bad like", "39:09", "inflammation isn't great or bad like it", "39:11", "just is where it's a chemical like it", "39:13", "doesn't give a shit at all it doesn't", "39:14", "know it's not conscious right so if you", "39:17", "were to do an hop in a nice pat post a", "39:19", "lifting session when you're trying to", "39:21", "add muscle mass she's gonna fuck up your", "39:22", "game probably yeah but you're supposed", "39:23", "to wait like two hours right it's not", "39:25", "the right number the more the better", "39:26", "probably more from four to six okay why", "39:29", "not why mess with it I know I read", "39:32", "something about to that two hours is", "39:33", "good after a hard lift well we don't", "39:35", "have any numbers to say optimal yet like", "39:38", "it would take a lot of studies to figure", "39:39", "out while twos not good but three is", "39:40", "better so every week you know we would", "39:43", "have to titrate it out we'd have to do a", "39:45", "study that says one group gets two hours", "39:46", "one group gets three hours and then you", "39:47", "have to like concentrate our effort like", "39:51", "how much exactly effort is just kept", "39:52", "putting verses that they don't have to", "39:53", "be in the same training program we don't", "39:54", "know obviously them all pre-imposed take", "39:56", "blood marks damn you got a lot of job", "39:58", "jobs to do there's a lot of work that's", "40:00", "why I'm so busy and there's create", "40:01", "involved in it too because you have to", "40:03", "kind of like manipulate things and", "40:05", "figure stuff out and contemplate and", "40:08", "well that's why I'm the director or the", "40:09", "co-director and I am the run my own lab", "40:11", "and I've got fantastic postdocs and", "40:13", "students that are actually the operators", "40:15", "that execute but it seems like", "40:16", "everything is constantly evolving and", "40:18", "shifting and changing and it's like well", "40:20", "I find myself honestly spending more", "40:22", "time being in the middle of saying like", "40:25", "let's stop all the fighting between", "40:26", "things and let's spend time saying what", "40:28", "was good for about this and what was bad", "40:29", "about this now when it comes to ice what", "40:32", "about an injury like what if somebody", "40:33", "twists their anchor or something like", "40:34", "that do you do you believe in icing it", "40:37", "right away I have to defer it's not my", "40:39", "area I'll get it all right but just to", "40:42", "finish the example so a post lifting", "40:44", "session maybe not great but maybe if you", "40:45", "wait six hours or do it the next day and", "40:48", "when we're talking about icing we're", "40:49", "talking about ice baths that we're", "40:51", "talking about are you talking about like", "40:52", "a cryo chamber we don't have a", "40:53", "tremendous amount of crowd chamber", "40:55", "research so I'll have to say well", "40:57", "actually I should say this with", "40:58", "everything like this is as we know it", "41:00", "now right but as I started the show with", "41:02", "like if I'm wrong in a year I'm gonna be", "41:04", "saying like actually all that was wrong", "41:05", "yeah this is part of it so what I've", "41:07", "read about cryo chambers is the the big", "41:10", "thing is the anti inflammatory markers", "41:13", "in the blood or the reduction of", "41:15", "inflammatory markers in the blood", "41:17", "improvements in cytokines called shock", "41:19", "proteins things along those lines that", "41:21", "those would be beneficial but if you're", "41:24", "saying that we got to be careful", "41:26", "beneficial okay so beneficial for some", "41:28", "things but they're always gonna come at", "41:30", "a compromise of something else okay so", "41:32", "maybe not beneficial for a powerlifter", "41:35", "that may be beneficial for an endurance", "41:37", "athlete does that make sense yes but not", "41:40", "I'm gonna make it worse oh no what so", "41:44", "you have physiology which is what I do", "41:45", "right and this is what science is week", "41:47", "we biopsy we took blood we measure one", "41:49", "marker but that doesn't take into", "41:50", "context anything else in their life", "41:51", "right so for example if you get a lift", "41:54", "in and you're like oh man my elbow", "41:56", "always things up on me after I lift and", "41:58", "I thought I got a competition in eight", "41:59", "weeks or a show in eight weeks this", "42:01", "would be like a powerlifting competition", "42:03", "or a bodybuilding competition and if you", "42:04", "get in the ice that takes that pain away", "42:06", "for whatever reason physiologically or", "42:08", "an igloo zyk or anything and that allows", "42:10", "you to train more well then we can't say", "42:12", "that that was bad for you right or if", "42:14", "you were like someone", "42:15", "like they feel more accomplished when", "42:17", "they do it they feel like they've done", "42:18", "some work so they feel less anxiety", "42:20", "because they got in work well then now", "42:22", "we're playing a game here of physiology", "42:24", "more accomplished when they got in the", "42:26", "exercise or the ice bath in this example", "42:29", "the ice bath oh but it would be true of", "42:31", "anything right so setting them up for a", "42:33", "psychological win oh that's fascinating", "42:36", "so you factor that in you have to like", "42:39", "we're dealing with human beings right", "42:40", "right but it might not even be real", "42:41", "totally but really it might but realist", "42:45", "perceptive right right yeah I guess so", "42:47", "for sure I mean confidence is a giant", "42:49", "factor absolutely with combat athletes", "42:52", "and there's some preliminary evidence", "42:53", "that suggests perhaps an ice bath I", "42:56", "think specifically post exercise", "42:57", "improved my increased mitochondrial", "43:00", "biogenesis yeah so now you say like well", "43:02", "it's bad or good post exercise well I'm", "43:04", "a cool what's the goal of the training", "43:05", "session", "43:06", "now when you say increased by a", "43:07", "mitochondrial biogenesis is that within", "43:11", "a certain time period post exercise or", "43:14", "is that just period well it would be a", "43:16", "when they took the biopsy of the blood", "43:18", "marker right but I'm saying like within", "43:20", "an hour after exercise with yes yeah so", "43:24", "this one I believe was immediately post", "43:26", "exercise so yeah huh Wow so now you got", "43:30", "a conundrum but this is physiology right", "43:34", "it's crazy this is why get so fucking", "43:36", "irritated when people say like nah this", "43:38", "is the thing and then they pull up plant", "43:39", "flags about like this is what we do", "43:40", "where we don't do it cuz I said the", "43:42", "middle going like you're gonna be a", "43:43", "terrible coach mm-hmm because you're", "43:46", "gonna be in a situation where you're", "43:47", "going to need to violate those rules", "43:49", "right Wow that's it's complicated it is", "43:53", "I mean this is why we're totally wrong", "43:55", "do you find that that's the case is diet", "43:56", "as well like I am a big proponent of", "44:00", "variable diets and I think that there's", "44:02", "a lot of biodiversity and beep well", "44:05", "obviously there is where people are", "44:06", "allergic to a certain type of foods you", "44:08", "know but I just think this", "44:11", "one-size-fits-all approach to diet seems", "44:14", "the more I study diet the more it seems", "44:16", "crazy so I would ask you this what do", "44:19", "you think about if I came to you and", "44:20", "said I'm gonna do one workout style the", "44:22", "rest of my life everyone would be like", "44:24", "that's that's stupid well if you want to", "44:26", "be a yogi that's a way to go", "44:29", "but most of us will say yeah no I also I", "44:32", "just don't think it's fun but why do we", "44:35", "so why is that acceptable to do that", "44:37", "with nutritionist yeah why is that I", "44:39", "have to be cute of genic and this is", "44:40", "what I do the rest of my life or I have", "44:41", "to be paleo or I have to be anything", "44:44", "else", "44:44", "why in fact is you you when you said", "44:48", "variability I assume you mean having a", "44:50", "wide variety of foods in your daily yeah", "44:53", "I think also a wide variety of who's in", "44:55", "your daily life but also I think what", "44:58", "works for you might not work for Jamie", "45:00", "or might not work for me yeah I think", "45:02", "that's the the bio variability but we're", "45:04", "gonna go inception on that one because", "45:06", "you're ready we're going another level", "45:08", "okay if that is absolutely true and most", "45:10", "people recognize that but what we don't", "45:12", "appreciate is the

yeah", "46:23", "okay you come to me this is a Joe's", "46:27", "fucking house of power we're gonna get", "46:29", "this shit right we know what we're doing", "46:31", "we got a team of experts till he's got a", "46:33", "team yeah those got a team yeah and then", "46:36", "you get you go I'm with the team yeah", "46:38", "yeah yeah I started I signed up with", "46:39", "Joe's team and and you really start", "46:41", "believing", "46:42", "okay this is gonna work but did you", "46:44", "think do you think physiology is that", "46:46", "precious it's pretty precious not like", "46:49", "that

for some people clearly like some", "46:58", "diets sure fit better like I've had a", "47:01", "bunch of friends that went plant-based", "47:03", "and not maybe not even vegan but the", "47:06",

defining it in any way", "48:32", "but in this particular case I mean so", "48:33", "say for example you get very good at", "48:35", "metabolizing fat as a fuel mm-hmm that", "48:37", "may come with the consequences then of", "48:38", "being able to use carbohydrate as a fuel", "48:40", "so if you're in a sport that requires", "48:42", "that that's potentially problematic what", "48:44", "sport would require you use", "48:46", "carbohydrates versus ketones anything", "48:48", "that's anaerobic so almost by definition", "48:50", "so anything that's maximal intensity", "48:53", "difficulty is

hundred percent keto and he", "49:07", "believes that ketogenic diets have a", "49:09", "host of benefits and that the human body", "49:11", "just it functions better on them well so", "49:14",

"49:21", "has been fantastic", "49:22", "like I'm in very much supportive the", "49:24", "vast majority of what I've heard him say", "49:26", "but his main lens is being focused on", "49:28", "cancer prevention epilepsy these things", "49:31", "mm-hmm but if you look at some of the", "49:32", "research and I'm not an oncologist so", "49:34", "I'm gonna speak a bit at a turn here but", "49:36", "there are now actually identification of", "49:38", "several cancers that thrive on fats", "49:40", "rather than carbohydrates really yeah", "49:43", "I've not seen this because he was", "49:44",

"he's totally right on that but I did", "49:55", "read something about a type of brain", "49:57", "cancer though that is not does not feed", "50:02", "on sugar right yeah so again it would be", "50:05", "like well good for cancer well what kind", "50:06", "of cancer right I'll for prop maybe 80%", "50:09", "of them he's right maybe maybe 90% I", "50:11", "don't know what the number it'd be",

you", "50:27", "well there's not really I mean I gotta", "50:30", "be careful faster and it works better", "50:33", "well you have carbohydrate directly in", "50:36", "the muscle cell that's where it's stored", "50:38", "is muscle glycogen okay and so it is an", "50:40", "immediate fuel source so when your tones", "50:42", "work then those are systemic those are", "50:44", "coming from the

has to be go", "51:08", "through like Paul", "51:09", "which means it's say it's stored fat in", "51:11", "your entire body so people right now", "51:13", "listen this podcast go", "51:14", "I don't know who fuck the belief man", "51:16", "it's not a kind of dude on Mondays says", "51:18", "one thing you got a dude on Wednesdays", "51:20", "there's another thing yeah shit so", "51:22", "that's a I guess that's what I would say", "51:24", "my biggest message is it's not like a", "51:25", "right or wrong thing that's the wrong", "51:27", "question entirely is who's right or", "51:29", "wrong", "51:29", "do you have any athletes who are on a", "51:31", "fat base table salutely who totally I'm", "51:34", "probably those ones I shouldn't say that", "51:37", "there's me know they're just like hey", "51:39", "don't talk about my diet stuff yeah some", "51:42", "do okay", "51:42", "the vast majority Ellen did iron", "51:44", "appellant we go through periods of that", "51:46", "with her for sure mm-hmm for a lot of", "51:47", "reasons a it's very successful with her", "51:50", "periods of that but not when she's", "51:51", "competing it's even during training but", "51:54", "not when she's competing yes not like on", "51:56", "competition day no yes but sometimes a", "51:58", "week of so on competition day no because", "52:01", "you feel like the glucose based diets", "52:03", "are more efficient for in terms of", "52:04", "actual physical performance", "52:06", "well most specifically for rehydration", "52:07", "purposes too okay so all right because", "52:10", "she's dehydrating heavily and if you", "52:12", "don't consume carbohydrates in the", "52:13", "rehydration process you have a real", "52:14", "problem okay that makes a lot of sense", "52:16", "so we don't go there but we'll do it", "52:18", "even maybe like five days out or working", "52:21", "of or something but where we have to be", "52:23", "careful there and this is one again this", "52:26", "is no I'm not bad-mouthing Dom at all", "52:28", "okay", "52:29", "no like nothing but he's not dealing", "52:31", "with somebody who's generally", "52:32", "hypocaloric right so when we're going", "52:35", "through an athlete who's six weeks of", "52:37", "coming down in calories and if we start", "52:39", "cutting out carbohydrates we actually", "52:41", "did address that I'm always saying that", "52:43", "when you're talking about ketogenic", "52:45", "states in particular when you're talking", "52:47", "about most people during or a regular", "52:49", "life 50 grams carburetor carbohydrates", "52:53", "would keep you in a ketogenic state but", "52:56", "when you're talking about like some you", "52:58", "know pro athletes power loved you in", "53:01", "hundreds it's 100 250 and you're still", "53:04", "ketogenic because your body has much", "53:06", "more requirements like I told you he's", "53:07", "smart yeah like I'm done generally on", "53:08", "board with what he's saying he's a", "53:09", "scientist just like you but the problem", "53:12", "is micronutrient quality mm-hmm so if an", "53:16", "athlete is coming down in calories that", "53:17", "and especially those calories are coming", "53:19", "from carbohydrate and carbohydrates are", "53:21", "their main source of carbohydrates are", "53:23", "Lance hmm so if we've compromised that", "53:25", "and they're really low in calories then", "53:26", "they go down to nutrients to", "53:28", "phytochemicals and that's a real problem", "53:29", "so we have to be very careful with", "53:31", "getting them into keto if it comes with", "53:34", "a compromising of vegetable of nutrition", "53:37", "right what about like cold-pressed", "53:38", "juices or anything like that that's", "53:40", "exactly what we do actually a lot of the", "53:42", "times we did that specifically in fact", "53:44", "that almost single-handedly saved REO", "53:46", "for oh it was a real problem she had a", "53:49", "real physiological crash like dude that", "53:51", "just sucks that to think that at the", "53:53", "highest level of amateur competition", "53:54", "they have poor food yeah well we had we", "53:57", "had to do like because especially", "53:58", "because she was basically broke we had", "53:59", "to like go up real struggle to find", "54:02", "cold-pressed things we could get to her", "54:04", "that because we had she was on like 40", "54:06", "ounces a day of that for a while Wow and", "54:08", "it's funny we did that and that's I", "54:11", "don't know you could do the math but 200", "54:12", "grams of carbs or something mm-hmm and", "54:14", "the second we did that her weight just", "54:16", "started falling really how interesting", "54:18", "so we added 200 grams of carbs and poom", "54:20", "weight just flew moldy wood atribute", "54:22", "that too combination of physiological", "54:25", "and psychological factors psychological", "54:27", "she felt better so it caused her weight", "54:29", "to drop yeah she was dressed out she was", "54:31", "freaked out the woman that cortisol", "54:34", "level capture weight higher absolutely", "54:35", "uh interesting see she was panicked and", "54:38", "she was freaked out and she was stressed", "54:39", "cuz she didn't feel good and she's like", "54:40", "I'm not losing any weight and once", "54:41", "well.one a part of it was we gave her a", "54:43", "system that she believed in okay and so", "54:46", "she like oh okay we can do this oh now I", "54:50", "also physiologically pump some nutrients", "54:51", "into you mmm so I don't know like", "54:54", "honestly I don't know what part of it", "54:56", "was it could've been all psychological", "54:57", "it could have been all physiologic I", "54:58", "don't know but what we know is it worked", "55:00", "right and we gave her a bunch of", "55:01", "nutrients and we're like 40 ounces a day", "55:03", "or up to 60 ounces a day of fresh", "55:05", "pressed vegetable juice and just like", "55:08", "clockwork every day you know this is", "55:10", "such a complicated subject and it's so", "55:12", "nuanced and there's so many different", "55:14", "variables that I feel like you have to", "55:18", "be a scientist to really truly", "55:19", "understand this I mean yes I know it's", "55:22", "one of the problems with the bro science", "55:24", "people the people that do not have the", "55:26", "real education and this stuff that are", "55:27", "out there - you know coaching athletes", "55:30", "and and teach them what to do and what", "55:32", "not to do it's like yeah you don't", "55:33", "really know what you're talking about", "55:34", "and that becomes a real", "55:36", "problem you have to get care like it's", "55:37", "funny because I don't know Dom like said", "55:41", "but he's example I've never heard him", "55:42", "plant a flag and be unmovable movable an", "55:45", "idea and it's funny because those of us", "55:46", "that do this for a living yeah", "55:48", "rarely do we do that right it's the", "55:50", "other dicks that do it I think you're", "55:52", "right it's like everyone else is like", "55:53", "what do you mean I get this one on fiber", "55:55", "type more than anything in the planet", "55:56", "fiber type that's what I do for a living", "55:58", "right like I could tell you more about", "56:00", "that than vast almost anyone on the", "56:02", "planet and then yet I'll still have", "56:03", "people who like I read this guy's", "56:04", "Instagram post bro you're wrong", "56:06", "like I've hunted up biopsied hundreds of", "56:08", "people have isolated tens of thousands", "56:09", "of fibers and ran them under lasers and", "56:11", "studied um and you're gonna tell me", "56:12", "because you read one Instagram post or", "56:14", "one review from two years well people", "56:17", "I mean nuts and they love it because of", "56:20", "that reason they know they love to call", "56:22", "bullshit on you I don't respond so it", "56:24", "doesn't good luck well no because I", "56:29", "bombed him with YouTube videos showing", "56:31", "them walking him through the science and", "56:33", "it's like alright yeah but they don't", "56:33", "read that or watch that like blah blah", "56:35", "blah dude you're wrong Instagram post I", "56:38", "had somebody on something a few weeks", "56:40", "ago some Instagram or something was like", "56:42", "going through she was being super", "56:44", "respectful so I didn't mind like helping", "56:46", "but I was like okay we're done here", "56:48", "because I already told you about my", "56:49", "three hour video on this and you didn't", "56:52", "watch it right fuck off bingo by the way", "56:59", "a three hour video is a god damn gift", "57:01", "from God because if you stop and think", "57:03", "about how much schooling you would have", "57:06", "to go through to get the information", "57:07", "that's in that three hour video it would", "57:10", "take a decade it took my career and you", "57:14", "could boil it down to three hours and", "57:16", "people like man not interested Instagram", "57:20", "page exactly guy add some shit that said", "57:22", "you're your own asshole well I did a", "57:24", "five-minute videos why my first I was", "57:26", "like a five-minute video mmm and I just", "57:28", "kept getting so much like ba ba bi you", "57:29", "didn't do this and I'm like either", "57:31", "really you think I missed that you think", "57:32", "I didn't read that one and I was like", "57:33", "fuck this like here we go here's the", "57:35", "whole shebang me and there you go just", "57:37", "there's the link that's it I'm done and", "57:39", "through it all up there and I still get", "57:40", "the change they don't change when you", "57:42", "train like oh here we go now so if", "57:45", "someone has like a lot of fast twitch", "57:47", "muscle fiber like let's see like Mike", "57:49", "Theisen in his prime as an example it's", "57:51", "like a ball of fast twitch could you", "57:54", "turn a guy like Mike Tyson into like an", "57:57", "ultramarathon no well I mean he could", "57:59", "maybe complete one right for sure but", "58:02", "it's just the elite ok so genetically", "58:05", "he's elite at fighting", "58:07", "he's just an explosive individual but", "58:09", "making him like you know feeling of like", "58:13", "David Goggins type character no I mean", "58:15", "we have so the the easiest way to", "58:17", "understand this is plasticity your", "58:20", "ability to change your adaptability", "58:21", "mm-hmm is far higher than what people", "58:24", "understand", "58:25", "in fact there's almost a direct link", "58:28", "between the increase in technology and", "58:29", "the increase in our thoughts of what", "58:31", "change and how much they change oh so", "58:33", "our ability to measure it bingo ok so", "58:35", "the reason why we didn't think fiber", "58:37", "type change 20 years ago is because we", "58:39", "didn't have the technology to actually", "58:40", "have the fidelity to measure all the", "58:42", "ones that we were missing and these are", "58:44", "also a probably a psychological factor", "58:46", "in there as well as from the people that", "58:47", "are measuring it it's probably easier to", "58:48", "say that it doesn't change then to say", "58:51", "that it does I don't know that it was", "58:53", "just more of like that was the evidence", "58:55", "CompTIA right so it's confirmation bias", "58:57", "the first 10 studies has not shown it so", "58:59", "therefore you're not looking for it", "59:00", "really hard", "59:01", "ok got it move on yeah otherwise you'd", "59:04", "be chasing your own tail forever on that", "59:05", "well I can tell you right now like it's", "59:07", "hard to post to get things into into", "59:11", "publication when they completely", "59:13", "challenged an entire the entire thought", "59:16", "example so for example if if you were", "59:19", "the first one to try to publish a study", "59:21", "that fiber types changed as a response", "59:23", "to exercise training and 20 years of", "59:25", "research suggested otherwise", "59:26", "you'd have a very hard time getting", "59:28", "through review mmm they would hammer you", "59:30", "for every little thing that like wow you", "59:32", "do this and do this and and is gonna be", "59:34", "very skeptical and right that's not good", "59:36", "yes that's how it should be that's how", "59:38", "it should be right extraordinary claims", "59:40", "require yeah so I have no beef with that", "59:44", "it's what the problem is when the other", "59:47", "people who aren't scientists and don't", "59:50", "pay attention like if you don't know it", "59:51", "like I do then you need like you can", "59:53", "talk about that's fine I talk about", "59:54", "stuff I'm not an expert about all the", "59:55", "time but you need to be careful when", "59:57", "someone else walks in the room and goes", "59:58", "like well I do this for a living", "60:00", "then you don't just concede the point", "60:02", "but you need to be a little more open", "60:04", "yeah with listening and going out really", "60:06", "bright didn't know that hmm yeah that's", "60:09", "uh that's interesting can you think of", "60:11", "anything that has changed other than the", "60:13", "fiber types that's changed the way", "60:16", "people look at things recently because", "60:17", "of technology yeah I mean that's a good", "60:19", "example um the the hyperplasia it's", "60:24", "probably the biggest one and what is", "60:26", "that so when your muscle gets a bigger", "60:28", "mmm you the diameter of each individual", "60:30", "muscle fiber gets larger so it just", "60:32", "thickens right well hyperplasia is a", "60:34", "concept that you actually add more", "60:36", "muscle fibers total so you add cells to", "60:39", "the entire muscle and for decades", "60:42", "basically you say that doesn't actually", "60:43", "exist in humans and now as we're", "60:45", "improving our fidelity of our", "60:46", "measurement techniques it looks like it", "60:49", "happens a lot we know what happens other", "60:51", "mammals how what happens in humans when", "60:53", "it does is gonna be very difficult and", "60:55", "probably impossible to ever show but we", "60:57", "have more and more evidence because we", "60:59", "know the mechanisms now behind the cell", "61:02", "growth so once we see the physiology the", "61:04", "mechanics

world", "66:10", "championship and wrestling the grinder", "66:12", "like he just is like pretty good at", "66:13", "everything yeah yeah", "66:14", "still just finds it tough you know he's", "66:16", "a guy I would love to biopsy and figure", "66:18", "out like how much slow touching fast", "66:20", "what does he have 34 beats per minute", "66:22", "resting heart rate he's fit yeah he's a", "66:25", "big factor it's a big factor and then he", "66:27", "could push a tremendous pace and then", "66:28", "keep it going like one of my favorite", "66:30", "fights of Michael's was when he beat", "66:33", "Hundley oh yeah cuz he's overwhelmed", "66:35", "them and just you see Khun starting to", "66:38", "get tired and Bisping just pull", "66:40", "or did on yeah just gave him a beating", "66:42", "and that was sort of in a lot of ways", "66:44", "like a shift towards I mean he was", "66:47", "always a world-class fighter there was a", "66:49", "shift towards like the upper end of the", "66:51", "of the division it was a big moment for", "66:53", "his career too because if he lost that", "66:55", "that's probably about night night for", "66:56", "him in terms of yeah you could say yeah", "66:58", "but he doesn't give a fuck knocked out", "67:00", "by Vitor comes right back you know got", "67:03", "knocked out by Henderson comes right", "67:05", "back he's one of the guys I've been", "67:06", "around him a bit uh he's hilarious but", "67:09", "he's one of the guys work and like he", "67:11", "doesn't he just not gonna shake him like", "67:13", "that no not at all he's undeniably tough", "67:16", "yeah and he's undeniably like when he", "67:18", "says like all fight that dude yeah he", "67:20", "legit oh yeah he's there yeah you can", "67:22", "say like all he's scared of Romero no", "67:24", "he's not like snow scared anyways dunno", "67:26", "he's trying to cash in when he should", "67:27", "like well I think the Bisping GSP fight", "67:30", "is a fascinating fight it's fascinating", "67:32", "first of all GSP is never fought at 85", "67:35", "he comes back he fights for a world", "67:37", "title it makes it compelling yeah I just", "67:39", "wonder that this is unfortunate but I", "67:41", "wonder how many of these young new fans", "67:43", "I would like to say like post Ronda", "67:46", "Rousey fans how many of you know who the", "67:48", "fuck GSP is I think there's a lot and my", "67:51", "wife definitely does well she's a fan", "67:53", "yeah but I mean I wonder of how many of", "67:55", "the new ones", "67:56", "you know the people coming up actually", "67:59", "know who he is and mean it's been a long", "68:02", "time yeah you know a couple years right", "68:04", "more than that yeah and when did he lose", "68:06", "to Johny Hendricks I want to say it's", "68:08", "three years ago at least at least yeah", "68:12", "well beat Johny Hendricks yeah I I'm not", "68:17", "a big believer in that decision I feel", "68:20", "like at most that was a draw I felt like", "68:22", "Hendricks got the most event my buddy", "68:24", "Troy its brother at 50k on Hendricks on", "68:26", "that fight dirty", "68:27", "yeah and outdoors he's like here we go", "68:29", "like we're done Hendricks thing was", "68:33", "interesting because Hendricks is one of", "68:35", "those guys that like oh like what", "68:37", "happened to that guy yeah you know like", "68:40", "what a lot of speculation on that where", "68:43", "you can all read between the lines there", "68:45", "well that's that's the problem right", "68:47", "there's do you side of speculation", "68:49", "there's the motivation speculation", "68:51", "there's a lot of speculation you also", "68:52", "have that thing to what guys like", "68:54", "that put in that many years of wrestling", "68:56", "mm-hmm and you start competing that hard", "68:58", "that young mm-hmm like that that wears", "69:01", "on you yeah time frame yeah yeah there's", "69:05", "a like people believe there's a nine", "69:07", "year window as a world-class fighter", "69:09", "I've heard that before", "69:10", "it depends on the sport but yeah that's", "69:11", "probably fair as a fighter and that as a", "69:14", "fighter like can you get to MMA in", "69:16", "particular guys have like nine years to", "69:18", "compete at a world-class level and then", "69:19", "the wheels just fall off yeah get in get", "69:21", "your money get out yeah if you can if", "69:24", "you can", "69:24", "yeah that's why the 38 I think Bisping's", "69:27", "38 that GSP fights the right move Oh 400", "69:30", "the right move anyway what does Bisbing", "69:33", "typically do well with like the fighters", "69:35", "like he handles wrestlers decently well", "69:36", "mm-hmm he's a very good defensive", "69:38", "wrestler yes his Styles can be fantastic", "69:40", "it doesn't get tired which is what GSP", "69:43", "relied on a lot is is stamina", "69:45", "conditioning was great but that stamina", "69:47", "like is dependent upon activity like do", "69:50", "you even if you're just physically fit", "69:52", "but you haven't fought in a long time I", "69:54", "don't necessarily know if it's it's", "69:55", "applicable yeah", "69:56", "well it's also gonna be different too", "69:58", "with we'll see what he does weight wise", "69:59", "yeah so what people don't understand", "70:02", "about when you watch professional", "70:04", "athletes fighters in particular is a lot", "70:05", "of what happens in that fatigue is", "70:07", "either psychological or it's bad weight", "70:09", "cut stuff mm-hmm so now you doesn't have", "70:10", "that but if he's lugging around extra", "70:13", "weight he's not used to potentially", "70:15", "problematic depending on how he does it", "70:17", "now he's got some smart people in this", "70:19", "camp so he's probably gonna be fine yeah", "70:20", "but that's a real problem that he may or", "70:23", "may not be ready for yeah if he's", "70:24", "lugging around extra weight but he was", "70:26", "always walking around somewhere around", "70:27", "185 190 he might just decide to compete", "70:30", "at that weight that's what I mean like", "70:31", "if he stays there he's probably fine but", "70:33", "if someone gets in his head and tries to", "70:34", "get him up to 202 or something and we're", "70:36", "back down like he's probably not gonna", "70:37", "feel normal there yeah but she's not", "70:39", "gonna run outta gas because of that like", "70:41", "having more muscle doesn't make you", "70:42", "fatigued more it's the training that", "70:44", "does it now do you have fighters use", "70:47", "cardio machines like yeah do you have", "70:50", "them use versa climbers or treadmills or", "70:53", "anything along those lines I don't feel", "70:55", "like those are super important", "70:57", "differences in terms of we're generally", "71:01", "trying to get most their physical", "71:02", "activity from training like if you have", "71:04", "an extra hour with the training we could", "71:05", "get in the week you mean by", "71:07", "martial arts training right really yeah", "71:09", "interesting so but having said that if", "71:12", "we want to do a small circuit or", "71:13", "something that incorporates one of those", "71:14", "things in there", "71:15", "sure but I'm never gonna prescribe if", "71:18", "they're not doing it like hey let's hop", "71:20", "on it let's get an hour on the", "71:21", "elliptical like that's never gonna come", "71:22", "out of my mouth hmm that's not to say I", "71:25", "would never use it all right I'm not", "71:26", "throwing anything I don't know pro or", "71:28", "con but that's that's tip do ditional e", "71:30", "not where I'm gonna go because it's far", "71:31", "easier for us to help them lose weight", "71:32", "through food than it is adding on an", "71:35", "extra hour and not adding on a Bextra", "71:36", "hour of activity can be real harmful for", "71:39", "them muscularly right we're necessarily", "71:41", "just talking about losing weight we're", "71:42", "talking about increase increasing", "71:43", "performance do you believe any of those", "71:45", "machines it's not believin Harappa Levin", "71:48", "right I would go to it if I needed it I", "71:49", "don't feel like Inc in camp it's a huge", "71:52", "need with the exception of maybe like a", "71:53", "recovery so you want to do like hey", "71:55", "let's go and easy 45 or something on the", "71:57", "bike but as like a 45 hard with the", "72:02", "exception of when you start moving to", "72:03", "championship fights I do think there's", "72:05", "good cause for doing maybe once a week", "72:07", "of saying like we do this with Durkin", "72:09", "all the time and like hey he loves to", "72:11", "ride mountain bikes so go out and the", "72:12", "mountain bike and go ride for when", "72:14", "you're saying directing me Pat comment", "72:15", "yeah sorry it's okay for people not", "72:17", "listening yeah don't know but hey that's", "72:19", "big part of it is because he loves that", "72:20", "mm-hm that's like his real mental", "72:22", "release mountain biking yeah it's a", "72:24", "great workout too right yeah that's", "72:26", "fantastic", "72:26", "it's he gets in the Sun he gets away", "72:28", "from people he gets to breathe and we're", "72:30", "not counting things which can be a", "72:32", "problem but if I had another athlete it", "72:34", "was like I absolutely hate jogging like", "72:35", "it's the worst thing I got a knee", "72:37", "problems hurts my back I'm never gonna", "72:39", "ask them hey go jog an hour", "72:40", "what are you them like what if you if", "72:43", "someone has knee problems you want to", "72:44", "get them do cardio 45-minute something", "72:47", "like that maybe in the pool a lot of", "72:50", "pool work can be really helpful if they", "72:51", "have access if they can't no one has", "72:54", "ever not loved the Aerodyne or air", "72:56", "assault bikes mmm like those are", "72:58", "fantastic first climbers are great I got", "73:00", "no problem with those things what is uh", "73:02", "is there a one machine that is like your", "73:06", "standby or go-to when it comes to a", "73:08", "cardio machine well those would probably", "73:09", "throw those are the rower the vertical", "73:12", "arm of the rower and the Aerodyne yeah", "73:14", "air assault any of those things", "73:15", "anything that allowed them to move that", "73:17", "minimizes the amount of technical", "73:20", "teaching you have to do", "73:21", "mmm so that's most people run horribly", "73:24", "this is like a real real real problem", "73:27", "especially wrestlers if you ever watch a", "73:29", "wrestler run it's like you're at your", "73:31", "you're a knee pain you're you're a", "73:33", "busted ankle waiting to happen so I'm", "73:35", "not gonna throw that on them and then", "73:36", "try to teach them a new movement skill", "73:37", "right it's just not needed there's a", "73:39", "thousand ways we can get there if they", "73:40", "already run well and they have a running", "73:41", "background and we could go there if they", "73:44", "want if they want some of them do like", "73:46", "it okay fine we can get there but if", "73:48", "they don't run well I mean technically", "73:49", "well if they're landing in bad positions", "73:52", "that their fear out everywhere and they", "73:54", "don't want to take time to go to a", "73:56", "running coach like Brian Mackenzie or", "73:58", "something then like we're not gonna have", "74:00", "that we're not gonna add a new skill", "74:01", "they know a lot of Greg Jackson's work a", "74:05", "lot of his camp they do these hill runs", "74:07", "in Albuquerque yeah you seen that stuff", "74:11", "yeah going up a hill is a little", "74:12", "different though yeah because generally", "74:15", "the foot position of the hill is much", "74:17", "easier to get to and it's harder to run", "74:19", "bad uphill than it is on flat ground hmm", "74:21", "generally so it is something you go to", "74:23", "but that's also probably something where", "74:25", "you don't have as much teaching and", "74:28", "you're in altitude so that by itself is", "74:30", "going to reduce how hard you work which", "74:32", "is gonna reduce the stress on your", "74:33", "joints and bones and looking right so", "74:35", "that helps so all that can be integrated", "74:37", "work you have you reduce the likelihood", "74:39", "of them getting a sore back or knees", "74:42", "because you added some 45-minute running", "74:44", "on there that didn't really have to", "74:45", "happen well he'll seem to reduce that", "74:47", "anyway because you're really almost like", "74:49", "doing squats it's almost like doing her", "74:51", "a lunge or something like that so you're", "74:52", "just kind of running and pushing your", "74:54", "body up and yes instead of like the", "74:56", "pounding the eccentric pounding is yeah", "74:58", "yeah this is a very good one of the most", "75:01", "important things we stress during fight", "75:03", "campus you want to minimize that", "75:04", "eccentric contractions because that", "75:07", "leads to more soreness and if you got", "75:09", "really sore legs and you got to go to", "75:10", "movie-type practice and somebody jacked", "75:12", "you in the leg like that that's a", "75:14", "problem and so you have to be able to", "75:15", "get work in without getting extremely", "75:17", "sore mmm so hills are a great example", "75:19", "Aerodyne is like the same thing right", "75:21", "it's pushing the whole time it's not", "75:22", "landing and impact swimming rowing all", "75:25", "these versa climbers that's why they're", "75:26", "so good or one of the reasons you do a", "75:29", "lot of work is airdyne or averse climber", "75:31", "those things limited in the", "75:33", "fact that like the movement is like very", "75:35", "specific and that is in terms of doing", "75:38", "that versus like maybe like a kettlebell", "75:41", "cardio workout", "75:42", "yep you should that's why you need to do", "75:44", "a combination mmm okay so it's a bunch", "75:46", "of different stuff just like we talked", "75:47", "with nutrition its variability that gets", "75:49", "this is what we're looking for", "75:51", "especially when the goal is not that", "75:54", "modality so for example if you're", "75:57", "competing in a kettle ball swinging", "75:58", "competition like you should be focusing", "76:00", "on that right but when you're using that", "76:02", "for another modality that doesn't", "76:03", "transfer over then you need to have a", "76:04", "wide range of stresses how do you know", "76:07", "like what to tell them to do though well", "76:10", "so that's the thing is I don't I don't", "76:11", "think that stress is necessary like who", "76:14", "cares what do you mean so the stress of", "76:16", "worrying about which one to do is not", "76:17", "important you shouldn't focus on being", "76:21", "like actually pick first a climber today", "76:22", "or should we add it should be what's the", "76:25", "training outcome we're looking for right", "76:27", "oh we're trying to improve your ability", "76:28", "to repeat maximal sustained 15-second", "76:32", "intervals with short rest and all at the", "76:34", "same time keeping your breathing", "76:36", "mechanics ok that's the goal now what", "76:40", "modality do we want to use today to", "76:42", "introduce that insult and so you think", "76:44", "the good move would be to introduce a", "76:47", "bunch of different things like one day", "76:49", "yeah one day do the kettlebell cardio", "76:51", "workout another day do the air assault", "76:53", "was that air salt bike but some salt", "76:55", "aerosol dyes punch another day do a", "76:58", "verse climber is a general quick", "77:00", "statement yeah absolutely but I would", "77:02", "say that the smarter approach would be", "77:04", "to step back and say well wait a minute", "77:05", "what's the goal of that workout mmm", "77:08", "what's the goal of today this week this", "77:10", "camp this fight that's where you then", "77:13", "that guides you to make that exercise", "77:14", "choice right so don't like you should", "77:17", "never choose the exercise because you", "77:18", "love the exercise that's a stupid reason", "77:19", "you're getting angry yeah it really", "77:21", "irritates me now do you measure resting", "77:25", "heart rate its body fat all that jazz", "77:27", "not really no no some folks do it it's", "77:31", "not super important for me you don't", "77:33", "feel like it's important in terms of", "77:35", "like finding out whether or not a", "77:35", "fighter's overtrained oh that's a little", "77:38", "bit different question so you can use", "77:40", "things like HRV to track those things", "77:42", "what's that heart rate variability so", "77:45", "it'll effectively think of it like are", "77:47", "monitor mm-hmm but it's going to look at", "77:49", "how so your your heart doesn't disco", "77:51", "beat beat mmm beat right it has", "77:54", "variabilities BB BB BB well that", "77:58", "actually is has some relationship with", "78:00", "your autonomic nervous system so if it's", "78:03", "really variable you're in a good spot if", "78:06", "you lose your variability and it becomes", "78:07", "beat beat beat beat beat you're actually", "78:11", "potentially beating overtrained so your", "78:14", "your nervous system is a little bit shot", "78:16", "there so you can use those in Joel", "78:17", "Jamison again it's done a ton of this", "78:19", "work and you can look at that to have an", "78:22", "ideas of whether or not they're over", "78:23", "trained so you can use that I don't", "78:25", "particularly use those things for a", "78:27", "couple of reasons", "78:28", "number one I know what's gonna happen", "78:31", "for the most part over the six weeks", "78:33", "like as camps going on like it's based", "78:36", "on performance the coach the athlete if", "78:37", "when I've been around them like we plan", "78:40", "it out so that this is a this is the", "78:41", "volume this week this is the volume this", "78:43", "week this is the volume this week so", "78:44", "that we don't get ourselves in those", "78:46", "situations and how do you know how to", "78:47", "plan the volume out like say if you got", "78:50", "a guy like you know fill in the blank", "78:51", "Chris Weidman comes to you and he wants", "78:54", "wants to train with you he's getting", "78:57", "preparing for a five-round championship", "78:58", "fight how do you know how much work to", "79:01", "give him like how do you how do you", "79:02", "schedule that so I would never have the", "79:04", "arrogance to step in and go okay this is", "79:06", "a volume you're at Chris I've never met", "79:07", "you great to meet you but here's your", "79:08", "volume right like that'd be stupid would", "79:10", "you have him come and do a test workout", "79:12", "for you no I would have a conversation", "79:14", "with as many of his coaches and honestly", "79:16", "the first time I work with them for", "79:17", "something like volume I generally would", "79:19", "just shut up and watch and go okay like", "79:22", "here's what here's what you're gonna", "79:23", "tell me you did so write on a piece of", "79:24", "paper what you did for the camp what's", "79:26", "your plan for the camp what have you", "79:27", "done in the past then I look and we can", "79:29", "assess some volume and then I can", "79:31", "generally tell okay this is normal for a", "79:34", "person of your caliber of your aid in", "79:35", "your experience or like you're way over", "79:37", "what's normal but I don't know how that", "79:40", "lands on you and then I watch and as we", "79:42", "go along and it's conversations", "79:43", "continuing and going this is happening", "79:46", "your other coach told me this you're", "79:47", "telling me this is going on blood work", "79:49", "came back here mm-hmm", "79:52", "don't know if we're in the right spot", "79:53", "here and then the second or third camp", "79:54", "round then I can have a feel and I can", "79:56", "go back at the previous notes and go", "79:57", "well this is 10 percent higher this far", "79:59", "three more times here", "80:00", "I think and then oh it always almost", "80:02", "always matches up with yeah I'm feeling", "80:05", "terrible etc itself right", "80:07", "what do you thoughts I'm like", "80:08", "plyometrics box jumps things along those", "80:11", "lines", "80:11", "yeah box jumps are generally misused so", "80:14", "people don't understand especially in in", "80:16", "CrossFit or in MMA or in wrestling", "80:19", "people use CrossFit for conditioning for", "80:21", "the most part which is fine but they", "80:24", "don't get the the biggest benefit out of", "80:25", "it which is strength speed power train", "80:27", "the reactive part of the system training", "80:30", "muscle spindles so absolutely fine is a", "80:32", "modality but they don't get that out how", "80:34", "do they know so for example someone does", "80:36", "a box jumps in life okay a box jumps I", "80:38", "want to get better power in my legs so", "80:40", "they'll go and do like alright let's", "80:42", "spar for five rounds and then I'll go do", "80:44", "100 box jumps as fast as I can", "80:46", "you're not getting any faster like that", "80:48", "you're just getting more tired that will", "80:51", "not improve your power at all it won't", "80:53", "no because you're not jumping half-assed", "80:55", "you're actually jumping at a very", "80:57", "submaximal now if you're using it for", "81:05", "conditioning fine mmm no problem but if", "81:09", "you're using it for the sake of", "81:10", "improving your foot speed or your power", "81:11", "or your strength or your explosiveness", "81:13", "you should be west rep well rusty yes", "81:15", "yes one two three reps take a break etc", "81:18", "what do you think of like that strong", "81:20", "first protocol do you know the pavel", "81:22", "Tatsu lean idea that you know he feels", "81:26", "that strength is its long same sort of", "81:29", "lines what are you talking about that", "81:30", "strength is essentially a skill oh", "81:32", "absolutely", "81:32", "you should not be doing things to", "81:35", "failure that the best way to do it in", "81:37", "his estimation is to do more sets with", "81:40", "more s'more break in between them that", "81:43", "is that's like very strength 101 like", "81:46", "you'd have a hard time for a true", "81:48", "strength person disagreeing with a lot", "81:51", "of that it's hard to get stronger when", "81:53", "you're tired so going to failure is not", "81:56", "as now I've talked to a bunch of people", "81:59", "about this that have started doing this", "82:00", "recently like within the last year or", "82:02", "two and they've all experienced great", "82:03", "results and that the idea being that you", "82:06", "used to go to failure and then you'd be", "82:08", "wrecked like three or four days instead", "82:11", "of that like say if you could do 10 reps", "82:13", "or something you do", "82:14", "five and then you take a big rest and", "82:16", "then you do five again and you took a", "82:18", "big rest and then you wind up instead of", "82:20", "doing 15 reps you wind up doing like 30", "82:23", "over the course of an hour and a half", "82:25", "and then you find the next day well I", "82:27", "mean you had Liu Yan be Simmons right", "82:30", "this is classic fuckin maniac that guy", "82:32", "is it was awesome", "82:34", "I love that guy I always tell my kids my", "82:37", "students to google him yeah you're not", "82:38", "gonna get like you know I could get", "82:40", "bored oh listen to my podcast with him", "82:41", "it's one of the most entertaining things", "82:43", "I've ever heard in my life", "82:44", "he's such a character the basic idea", "82:46", "well it will have to back up for a quick", "82:47", "sec cuz it depends on the goal right", "82:49", "strength if coal pure strength is the", "82:51", "goal failure also has to be defined so", "82:54", "we have what do you mean by failure now", "82:56", "my family because of fatigue right then", "82:58", "he's totally right right am i failing no", "83:00", "because they're too heavy well you do", "83:01", "want to go to that failure for strength", "83:03", "I hope so though so you need do at some", "83:05", "point pick up something that you can't", "83:07", "pick up or really close to can't pick up", "83:09", "to get stronger really close to it like", "83:11", "you can do it right but you can't do a", "83:14", "second one right put it down or maybe", "83:17", "you could do two but you can do three", "83:18", "years something like the very textbook", "83:20", "answer is anything below five", "83:21", "repetitions ish it's gonna be good for", "83:24", "strength yeah so the Masters anything", "83:26", "more than five is bodybuilding that's", "83:28", "what Powell says he that's the that's", "83:30", "pretty dead-on", "83:31", "I mean he's not too wrong there and what", "83:33", "like well a reason I brought Louie up is", "83:34", "is he's classic we're saying first reps", "83:37", "so if you did three sets of ten right", "83:40", "well you had three first repetitions", "83:43", "right so you had three reps that you did", "83:45", "after rest mmm but if you did ten sets", "83:49", "of three now you had ten first reps mmm", "83:53", "Oh interesting right so now you did the", "83:55", "same total repetitions but 10 of them", "83:57", "were done after full rest which means", "83:59", "you're gonna have more power and more", "84:00", "force that makes sense that it seems", "84:03", "smarter that's basically it so you're", "84:05", "better off doing ten threes than 310 or", "84:08", "strength first strength or power or", "84:09", "speed and then taking a big break in", "84:12", "between them it's sort of", "84:13", "counterintuitive to a lot of people they", "84:14", "feel like oh I don't want to be a pussy", "84:15", "and right and then let myself get fully", "84:18", "recovered I want to push walls till I", "84:20", "come on boy come on broke right you're", "84:22", "gonna fill your room work and they'll", "84:23", "help you up come on come on yeah", "84:26", "or I see that all the time meatheads in", "84:29", "the gym and they think that's the way to", "84:31", "go and I'm like man how now and they're", "84:33", "gonna wool they're gonna", "84:34", "it's the way to go if they want to get", "84:35", "sore if they want to maybe prove us and", "84:37", "do that though they'll have to warm", "84:38", "round sore", "84:39", "you know what's funny this is like the", "84:42", "number one reason I got into MMA was", "84:44", "that that question like right there be", "84:46", "kept coming to me with this and I'm like", "84:48", "you don't know basic to speed training", "84:50", "or strength training and the MMA guys", "84:52", "were so wrong and I'm like that's how I", "84:53", "got into this for the most part is it's", "84:55", "people are like oh my god this is", "84:56", "changing like everything I'm like well", "84:58", "MMA training is it's we really strange", "85:01", "because MMA training is essentially it's", "85:04", "still in its infancy right it really", "85:06", "didn't even exist until 1993 and then it", "85:10", "didn't even really exist even then until", "85:13", "like yeah I feel like Frank Shamrock was", "85:15", "the first real professional MMA fighter", "85:18", "because he was the first guy to figure", "85:20", "out that you have to be an insane cardio", "85:22", "and he was the first guy to be able to", "85:25", "strike and also be able to grapple to be", "85:27", "able to fight off of his back and piece", "85:29", "it all together and the cardio is was it", "85:32", "was a huge factor you know he was like", "85:34", "when he beat Tito Ortiz it was way", "85:36", "smaller than Tito right but he beat him", "85:38", "because of cardio but one of the things", "85:40", "that I used to see early on that was so", "85:43", "confusing to me because I came from a", "85:45", "striking background was how many of", "85:47", "these guys were willing to beat the fuck", "85:49", "out of each other in the gym and like", "85:52", "that they were just going to war but not", "85:54", "even going to war with like good skills", "85:57", "like going to war while they were", "85:59", "learning for the sake of war yeah I mean", "86:02", "I'm watching them getting coached and", "86:03", "they're beating the shit I'm like you", "86:04", "guys are professionals like this isn't", "86:07", "like this isn't like some idiots at the", "86:09", "Y like you guys are you're supposed to", "86:12", "be pros yeah", "86:13", "like you could have damaged yourself the", "86:15", "fans take years off of your career the", "86:17", "vast majority of you know me working", "86:19", "with athletes is doing these very very", "86:23", "basic things like I'm not I'm absolutely", "86:25", "not the gurus like oh I know the the", "86:27", "18-point blood test and we're gonna get", "86:29", "these the vast majority of what I do is", "86:31", "go oh okay I see the problem here", "86:33", "uh-huh we need to do this basic thing", "86:35", "right you haven't eaten a vegetable in a", "86:37", "week got it like you", "86:39", "as not as much anymore but I used to", "86:41", "relay Nia we get a lot of the pro", "86:44", "athlete that doesn't eat vegetable we", "86:45", "get is honestly it's because probably", "86:47", "cuz assholes like you and I watch your", "86:48", "show or something I tell people you", "86:52", "vegetables all the time know that they", "86:53", "watch this and then like okay no come", "86:54", "with me with a thousand I really weird", "86:57", "nutrition questions or something a", "86:58", "really weird advanced training ones cuz", "87:00", "I went to a seminar or something and I'm", "87:01", "like back the train up like your", "87:03", "sparring six times a week", "87:04", "mmm yeah we've got a whole nother", "87:07", "conversation like oh we don't do that no", "87:08", "that's not normal", "87:09", "really no okay or you're doing that or", "87:12", "you're running 35 miles a week got it", "87:15", "like that's the vast majority of what I", "87:17", "do is is bring these guys back to life", "87:18", "and go like let me help you sift through", "87:20", "all this internet stuff that's really", "87:22", "complicated and let's take what's", "87:24", "actually good and bad and and dial in a", "87:26", "very usable system so I think people", "87:29", "just get overwhelmed with options from", "87:31", "the internet absolutely hmm because too", "87:33", "many people get on exposure I get on", "87:36", "shows or platforms and they try to make", "87:38", "sure that that they are known as the guy", "87:40", "that knows something different right", "87:41", "right right", "87:43", "it's like it's not very exciting if I", "87:44", "come up here until you like Joe ants", "87:45", "pros and cons to everything great like", "87:48", "well that's not fun but it's good I mean", "87:50", "I think what you're saying is very", "87:51", "important for people to hear yeah like", "87:53", "they don't wait they get bogged down in", "87:54", "the details way too much of things that", "87:56", "really don't matter your body's not that", "87:58", "sensitive or insensitive enough where it", "88:00", "can't convert something from something", "88:02", "to something else and if it needs it it", "88:04", "will do that for the most part so there", "88:06", "are some real small things at the end", "88:08", "but a lot of what we can do is like this", "88:10", "just get you on a reasonable program", "88:11", "that's actually possible for you to", "88:14", "implement mmm and that doesn't drive you", "88:16", "so crazy or so is so difficult so", "88:19", "confusing for you that you get halfway", "88:20", "and do it you abandon it and then you", "88:21", "want start over well you know I always", "88:23", "think about Dan Gable when Dan Gable was", "88:26", "young he pretty much outworked anybody", "88:28", "and he was just an unbelievable savage", "88:31", "when it came to his training and then", "88:33", "that manifested itself in the", "88:34", "competition he was just like the", "88:35", "momentum behind him because of his", "88:37", "ruthless training was so intense but now", "88:41", "he can't even walk right when his hips", "88:43", "are gone as knees are gone it's got", "88:45", "artificial everything you know he's just", "88:47", "fucked up because of it and some guys", "88:48", "are willing to make that sacrifice yeah", "88:50", "but is that here's the question is that", "88:52", "sacrifice now", "88:53", "sorry like uh can you be too tough vs.", "88:58", "smart in your training it's impossible", "89:01", "to say right because like you said that", "89:03", "here's where it gets so tricky is", "89:05", "physiology versus psychology so if that", "89:08", "gave him that extra mental confidence", "89:09", "that he needed to perform better well", "89:12", "then it's hard to say that it wasn't", "89:13", "necessary yeah like he was always", "89:15", "talking about guys on steroids that he", "89:17", "liked compete against guys on steroids", "89:19", "because he knew they were mentally weak", "89:20", "and he would break right so who the hell", "89:22", "knows right like you got you have all", "89:24", "this conflicting stuff and you try to do", "89:26", "this dance which is why again you need", "89:27", "people you need a team to do this stuff", "89:29", "and say okay this is what I think some", "89:31", "people have a really hard time with", "89:33", "physiological truth or scientific truth", "89:36", "and implementation so a very easy one", "89:42", "sugar right now like I don't know anyone", "89:45", "in the world who advocates adding sugar", "89:46", "to your diet it's a good thing like no", "89:49", "one's gonna say that right but what you", "89:52", "tell somebody a scientific truth versus", "89:54", "what the message you spread spread to", "89:56", "either your athletes are a bunch of", "89:57", "people that can be very very different", "89:59", "because because of unintended", "90:01", "applications or Consequences so for", "90:04", "example there is no physiological harm", "90:06", "with sugar it's not bad for you in any", "90:08", "way but as a message to the general", "90:12", "public that's not the worst thing to say", "90:15", "and so most the fighting that goes back", "90:17", "and forth between any conversation like", "90:19", "this is people saying yeah yeah but the", "90:21", "actual effect of it is good yeah but the", "90:23", "science is wrong and they're not", "90:24", "conceding that they're actually talking", "90:26", "past each other far more than they're", "90:27", "talking let me sell it right there you", "90:29", "don't think that sugars bad for you no", "90:31", "it can't be it can't be sugar", "90:36", "now we've okay so sugar in your diet", "90:39", "nope so this is where it gets confusing", "90:41", "exactly cuz you wanna break on sugar", "90:42", "yeah well having sugar in your diet like", "90:45", "eating sugary foods and snacks having an", "90:48", "excess of sugar has dire health", "90:51", "consequence totally correct absolutely", "90:52", "okay there's a key word you said there", "90:53", "was excess excess okay so like meaning a", "90:57", "piece of fruit like a nectarine not bad", "91:00", "for you at all", "91:01", "no of course good for you and plus fiber", "91:02", "absolutely yeah but processed sugar were", "91:05", "they", "91:06", "to remove from that fiber and put into a", "91:07", "coca-cola that becomes an issue yeah", "91:10", "because of concentration issues yeah", "91:12", "because now you can consume at a", "91:13", "concentration that probably wouldn't", "91:14", "happen normally right and quantities", "91:16", "that would never happen normally bingo", "91:18", "so now you could have person in the", "91:20", "corner of left who that says like no", "91:22", "you're an idiot look at

not good don't do it right", "91:48", "which is a net good thing although", "91:49", "technically individually it's not true I", "91:53", "see what you're saying so sugar in and", "91:56", "of itself

to talk about that too much there's", "94:19", "only nine episodes it's not like gone on", "94:20", "running podcast it's like radio lab Dan", "94:23", "Carlin but for physiology Gould and", "94:25",

give them mishmash", "95:10", "right so people generally I find work", "95:13", "well with nutrition information either", "95:15", "one of two approaches so if I said Joe", "95:18", "I'm gonna do a

some people", "95:52", "would cook just wants ideas right give", "95:55", "me the concepts like one or two things", "95:56", "to work through cool I don't I get", "95:59", "anxiety with all those

to give them a very very specific", "96:37", "system have a cup of this tablespoon of", "96:40", "that even if that system isn't perfect", "96:42", "what about chef so a chef is someone who", "96:45",

first day you know what you're", "97:19", "saying so get a detailed understanding", "97:22", "about how your body functions under very", "97:24", "specific protocols and then start", "97:26", "fucking around with it or the opposite", "97:28", "start off with a cook approach it to say", "97:30", "let's give me let me give you one or two", "97:31", "concepts this week I want you to eat one", "97:34",

"97:43", "concept and as you get better you get", "97:45", "more confident", "97:46", "and you get more comfortable you can go", "97:47", "okay well how much protein exactly now", "97:50", "let's just try hunter grams all right", "97:51", "well that's that let's try hundred fifty", "97:53", "and we've we've slowly pushed you", "97:56", "but generally being a baker all those", "97:58", "rules weighing everything generally", "98:00", "that's not sustainable for most people", "98:02", "hmm now when you coat do you coach them", "98:06", "as far as their diet goes do you", "98:08", "actually tell them what they shouldn't", "98:09", "should need depends on if they're cook", "98:11", "or a baker so a cook I do not I tell", "98:14", "them basic concepts right so I talked to", "98:17", "them how what's gonna be helpful for", "98:18", "them they think I should do should I add", "98:20", "more carbs or should I hear some", "98:22", "feelings when I'm I'll go we're way out", "98:24", "like cure diet yeah yeah let's add more", "98:26", "carbs how should I do it this or this", "98:27", "this one do you generally tell people to", "98:30", "avoid any specific foods or are there", "98:32",

"98:53", "or chicken or meat it's a cook uh-huh", "98:56", "no no if it's a baker absolutely", "98:58", "absolutely", "98:59", "and whether it's important that i chosed", "99:01", "fish or chicken almost doesn't matter as", "99:03", "much as telling them that the fact that", "99:05", "they oh cool he's got it dialed for me", "99:07", "great I got you know eight ounces of", "99:10", "halibut there it is BAM right right cuz", "99:13", "you'd be like the vast majority of the", "99:14", "ones I work with are already pretty good", "99:16", "with their nutrition and it's really", "99:18", "more concepts some of them would want", "99:20", "the stress relief tell them what to eat", "99:22", "and they want someone to come in and hey", "99:23", "do you know anyone that come in and food", "99:25", "prep meal prep for me and yeah okay we", "99:27", "can do that but some of them like it", "99:29", "some of it is their de-stress some of", "99:31", "them like that control no I I try to", "99:33", "help them again it's not about me I", "99:35", "don't care if my system worked I don't", "99:37", "have a system my system is what do you", "99:39", "want to do how can I help you and your", "99:41", "team what can we do that's the approach", "99:43", "right Wow God that seems so it's there's", "99:47", "so many variables and it's so complex", "99:50", "yeah which is why I get so irritated", "99:51", "utin you're teasing me earlier about", "99:53", "getting all fired up about it I could", "99:56", "understand but I appreciate this", "99:57", "intellectual honesty", "99:59", "about these variables and about how", "100:02", "there is not one approach because again", "100:04", "there's so many dickheads out there that", "100:07", "are teaching their method and air quotes", "100:09", "so here we go let's take those dickheads", "100:11", "right if you're a baker landing on one", "100:14", "of those systems is gonna be fantastic", "100:16", "for you and you're gonna five-start", "100:18", "review them you're gonna because you're", "100:20", "a baker yeah and you needed a system", "100:22", "mm-hmm yeah and if you're a cook though", "100:25", "you're like well who cares and if a", "100:27", "scientist could step in and go like well", "100:28", "these are all the problems and this and", "100:30", "this and this and this and then and", "100:31", "everyone's fighting back and forth", "100:32", "you're like well fuck do i guest or not", "100:34", "I felt like I'm so confused well it's", "100:36", "done the right question I think what", "100:38", "irritates a lot of people is that some", "100:41", "people are finding like this insecurity", "100:45", "that people have and they're exploiting", "100:47", "it by telling them exactly what they", "100:51", "think is right", "100:52", "it's human nature yeah right we want the", "100:54", "next solution we want all this stuff we", "100:56", "want it all dialed into one it's I call", "100:58", "a fallacy of unicorn mm-hmm like I'm", "101:00", "just gonna keep searching because", "101:01", "there's there's this one thing if I fix", "101:03", "that one thing everything else a lineup", "101:05", "mmm doesn't work like that yeah", "101:08", "now what about vegetables like do you", "101:10", "specify the type of vegetables you like", "101:12", "do you prefer a dark leafy green", "101:14", "vegetable general statement beets or the", "101:17", "more color the more texture the Benham", "101:18", "right and like you said actually earlier", "101:21", "it's the variety that matters what these", "101:22", "folks is sustainable now having said", "101:24", "that here's what I'll do outside a camp", "101:26", "these are conversations we're having", "101:28", "like I want as many different vegetables", "101:30", "as you possibly can different colors", "101:32", "different countries different seasons", "101:34", "all this stuff right let's let's cook", "101:36", "them sometimes let's steam them let's", "101:38", "eat them fresh let's eat them raw", "101:39", "there's pros and cons mix it up exactly", "101:42", "oh now you got a fight in four weeks and", "101:44", "we're 25 pounds overweight", "101:46", "sometimes I will take those options away", "101:48", "because it's easy then to control", "101:51", "numbers if I say okay here's the", "101:53", "approach you're gonna have a B and C got", "101:57", "these three meals every day mm-hmm every", "101:59", "other day we'll rotate then I've just", "102:01", "removed a bunch of variables from there", "102:03", "and they can just real focus and go okay", "102:04", "boom and we can watch the weight we're", "102:06", "down half a pound we're down half pound", "102:07", "down a quarter pound we're great let's", "102:10", "maybe exchange out kale for spinach this", "102:11", "time or something but", "102:13", "the hard part about extreme variability", "102:14", "is lack of control mmm and so sometimes", "102:19", "if you're like wow I mean no I think", "102:20", "you're telling me I'm eatin a bunch of", "102:21", "different stuff and I'm not losing", "102:22", "weight well maybe they don't understand", "102:24", "yeah but this type of vegetable has a", "102:26", "lot more calories than this type of", "102:27", "vegetable so we're getting really high", "102:29", "up in your numbers or when you eat this", "102:31", "the way you prep it the way you like it", "102:32", "is calorically dense so I will reduce", "102:36", "options for them so it is funny because", "102:38", "if you looked at you know one of my", "102:40", "nutrition programs for my athlete you", "102:42", "could look at it and be like let's guys", "102:44", "an idiot he doesn't have this this this", "102:46", "and this he's stupid he doesn't have any", "102:47", "of this and you're like dummy you think", "102:49", "that that three day plan is what we did", "102:51", "the whole year round your argument is", "102:52", "not even real oh they're real you of all", "102:57", "people know they're real I know what", "102:59", "about water no I've always wanted to ask", "103:01", "somebody this I hope you know the answer", "103:02", "there's all these these ways to treat", "103:06", "water now go line water runs and full", "103:09", "shit right mostly yeah I would assume so", "103:11", "yeah we've actually a study on that six", "103:13", "weeks alkaline what does it mean like", "103:15", "what the fuck is outgoing water that's", "103:17", "pH right so it's the opposite of acid", "103:19", "right alkaline so base but I mean how do", "103:22", "they make the water that way like what", "103:24", "are they doing to it Oh so generally", "103:25", "water comes probably a little bit acidic", "103:28", "especially our tap water and so I would", "103:30", "imagine they just do some sort of", "103:32", "combination of salt or desalting pretty", "103:34", "easy", "103:35", "we're on chemistry wise so to get it a", "103:36", "little bit technical so just I think", "103:38", "you've all to your water I think", "103:40", "somebody did um actually did a study of", "103:42", "a bunch of those alkaline waters and", "103:44", "tested them in the store like bonden", "103:46", "brands and they were all over the place", "103:47", "acidity wise yeah I would imagine that", "103:49", "I'm close to alkaline but you also have", "103:51", "like remember it's gonna change and it", "103:53", "sits on the Shelf right exposed to", "103:54", "sunlight all that crap I call it holy", "103:57", "water yeah it's kind of silly", "103:58", "I mean I'm I always feel like like oh", "104:01", "yeah that's the Blessed water come on", "104:03", "man it's fucking water I mean dude look", "104:04", "I'm open if right studies came out and", "104:07", "we kept doing well should there's", "104:08", "something here well there's no studies", "104:10", "that's happened before what something", "104:11", "like that's nonsense that's stupid", "104:13", "I mean a bunch of things the training", "104:16", "mask it's a training mask yeah", "104:18", "absolutely", "104:18", "is it good well it's not good or bad", "104:20", "depends on what you use it for how dare", "104:22", "you yeah I knew", "104:24", "answer I'll give you an answer okay so", "104:26", "what I'd like to do is give examples of", "104:28", "one good one bad right and this is Brian", "104:32", "Mackenzie I keep bringing him up but he", "104:33", "taught me this lesson this is a great", "104:34", "lesson in humility so he's a if you", "104:37", "don't know him he's a it was really", "104:39", "disruptive in the running community and", "104:40", "the movement he came up Kelly Starrett", "104:42", "like they came up together okay", "104:44", "so I wasn't interested in him people", "104:46", "kept getting at me like hey go look at", "104:48", "his stuff and I'm like well he's a", "104:49", "CrossFit coach out like not if you don't", "104:51", "like CrossFit is nothing against that", "104:53", "but at the time I was like what this", "104:55", "right okay CrossFit coach now right", "104:57", "again arrogance on my part mistake and", "104:59", "second I'm like you're a running coach", "105:00", "like I'm doubling and uninterested yep", "105:03", "again this is me highlighting my mistake", "105:05", "soon so but then I actually you know", "105:07", "funny enough paid attention to what he", "105:09", "was saying and it turns out there was", "105:10", "something there so it's funny how much", "105:12", "he hated someone when you don't actually", "105:13", "listen right or read their stuff so he", "105:17", "was promoting the training mask and I'm", "105:19", "like you know like everyone else in like", "105:20", "doesn't work evidence shows doesn't work", "105:21", "etc etc etc and then I listened to what", "105:24", "he was how he was actually using it so", "105:26", "he wasn't using it to simulate altitude", "105:28", "because that's not really effective but", "105:30", "he was using it to teach people how to", "105:32", "use their diaphragm and that's when I", "105:35", "was like oh I get it here so I'll come", "105:40", "back and I'll finish this in but the", "105:42", "quick analogy here would be if I handed", "105:44", "you a pen and said you know like this is", "105:47", "pen work well it may not work as a", "105:50", "dagger but it worked pretty good as a", "105:52", "pen so the problem with the mask was its", "105:54", "flipped it didn't work for what he was", "105:56", "told you to work for but it worked", "105:58", "because it in this case the act of", "106:01", "restricting people's breathing sometime", "106:02", "can help them learn to use their", "106:04", "diaphragm people who breathe with their", "106:06", "shoulders up mm-hmm and they don't use", "106:08", "their stomach and their diaphragm a lot", "106:09", "when you put that mouthful in front of", "106:11", "their face they don't have that option", "106:13", "and so they learn to breathe through", "106:14", "their belly and use their diaphragm mmm", "106:17", "and so I just didn't give him the time", "106:19", "of day because I'm like training mask", "106:21", "doesn't work elevation etc etc oh that's", "106:24", "not how you were using and what's the", "106:25", "benefit of breathing through diaphragm", "106:28", "with a mask on it's not the mask that's", "106:30", "important is the fact that it would use", "106:32", "it's a quick way to identify if you're", "106:34", "bring this so you figure no it's like a", "106:36", "weight belt", "106:37", "bas Rutten has some sort of a breathing", "106:40", "device and he he was telling me about", "106:44", "some studies that they did with it", "106:45", "I wasn't showed was he you that's mine", "106:47", "Oh beautiful my lab well what he was", "106:49", "saying is that what makes his better is", "106:51", "that it's easy to breathe out then the", "106:54", "valve open so you can exhale really good", "106:57", "dump your carbon dioxide where's other", "106:58", "ones that have just smaller holes are", "107:01", "not as good so we did that study okay", "107:04", "and this is actually that's what turned", "107:06", "me on to Brian initially because I'm", "107:08", "like the boss came to me with the o2", "107:09", "trainer I was like like this stuff", "107:11", "doesn't work bro turns out of this but", "107:15", "here's a good example", "107:16", "so his device restricts airflow in right", "107:20", "but you can change the setting so it can", "107:22", "be a lot of restriction or a little bit", "107:24", "richer yeah he has like filters that you", "107:26", "put on there so right there bas Rutten", "107:28", "yeah the o2 trainer exactly so all those", "107:32", "little valves on the left and right hand", "107:33", "side they're thick they oh no he", "107:35", "increased airflow or decrease airflow so", "107:37", "what we did is we had people come in", "107:38", "four times and they either got the high", "107:41", "restriction low restriction and medium", "107:43", "restriction or no restriction and what", "107:45", "we saw is in every person under one of", "107:49", "those sorry come back up they that came", "107:51", "in and either they did some breathing", "107:53", "drills like blowing it out inhaling as", "107:56", "hard as they can", "107:57", "blowing it out and they did that 30", "107:59", "times and then they did basically a vo2", "108:02", "max test so they ran to exhaustion which", "108:03", "took them five to eight minutes kind of", "108:05", "thing so we want to see like I was", "108:07", "interested in performance like does this", "108:08", "actually make me perform better and so", "108:11", "they either got a lot of restriction to", "108:12", "the restriction medium or none every", "108:15", "single person got substantially better", "108:17", "like twenty to thirty percent better", "108:19", "under one of the conditions but they", "108:22", "also got worse under one of the", "108:24", "conditions as well so what that told us", "108:27", "was this if for example you went under", "108:30", "the high restriction so you're like and", "108:33", "you can't get any air in it actually", "108:35", "fatigued your intercostals which are the", "108:37", "muscles between your ribs that open up", "108:39", "your ribs and allow airflow in the", "108:41", "diaphragm and those got fatigued so when", "108:44", "you did your performance you got slower", "108:45", "because you were already cast hmm but if", "108:49", "you had really strong intercostals", "108:51", "the lower so the real open valve wasn't", "108:55", "enough resistance to actually cause", "108:57", "those muscle to warm up so that didn't", "109:00", "help your performance so what we found", "109:03", "is my point here basically is the", "109:05", "individualization of the approach here", "109:07", "is really really important so there's", "109:08", "something there for all of us but you're", "109:10", "gonna have to titrate out you might need", "109:12", "heavy you might need light you might", "109:14", "need middle and one of those situations", "109:15", "you might actually make it worse for you", "109:17", "so the the individual variability is the", "109:19", "important point there how would you", "109:21", "figure out which one you needed", "109:22", "performance test and what kind of", "109:25", "performance s for use in this predicted", "109:27", "say I'm gonna run a mile and a half and", "109:28", "a quarter my time and put that thing in", "109:30", "your mouth as you're running or as your", "109:32", "as your warm-up as your warm yeah so you", "109:34", "sit there you put in your mouth and you", "109:35", "do so you only use it to do drill so you", "109:39", "don't necessarily use it to actually", "109:40", "work out the vast majority the time", "109:42", "that's what I recommend mmm you could do", "109:44", "it when your work out but it would be", "109:47", "for different reasons so when you do it", "109:49", "what would you recommend doing like say", "109:51", "say if I got an o2 trainer I put it in", "109:53", "like what kind of workouts am i doing", "109:55", "with this thing in my mouth what am i or", "109:56", "breathing exercise again you're gonna", "109:58", "hate this okay probably some of your", "109:59", "fans are getting irritated by now but it", "110:01", "depends on the goal to workout so if the", "110:06", "goal of the workout is to get the best", "110:08", "score possible right", "110:09", "then you do probably 30 or 40 breaths", "110:11", "with the optimal resistance feel great", "110:14", "okay but if the point of the workout is", "110:16", "to actually improve the strength of the", "110:19", "diaphragm bingo right then you then you", "110:22", "put yourself in suboptimal positions", "110:23", "it's right back to what I said beginning", "110:24", "adapting or optimizing so you're talking", "110:27", "about so the muscles in between the ribs", "110:29", "can you actually strengthen those to the", "110:31", "point with I mean that's a huge issue", "110:32", "with guys cuz you're injured absolutely", "110:34", "you get strengthen those with that bow", "110:36", "to training with that's one mechanism", "110:38", "but you can do it a bunch of different", "110:39", "ways we have done you've had you've had", "110:44", "wim hof on yeah so I've been working", "110:45", "with wim for a couple years now so doing", "110:48", "initial stuff with him and it's very", "110:50", "clear like we can mess with a lot of", "110:52", "different breathing protocols and get", "110:53", "you a lot of immediate and delayed up oh", "110:56", "sorry Brian one more time", "110:59", "he had his conversation with John Jones", "111:01", "on Wednesday before the fight first time", "111:04", "that ever met", "111:05", "someone put him in contact Brian put him", "111:07", "through some of these breeding protocols", "111:08", "as soon as they hung with the phone or", "111:10", "soon as they were done John was like hey", "111:11", "we fly down here on Saturday flew him", "111:13", "down that day had him in his corner", "111:14", "walked him all the way down was right", "111:16", "next to probably you and Dana Moniz", "111:18", "doing all the things so like this is how", "111:19", "impactful some of these breathing things", "111:20", "aren't our women was great to get us", "111:22", "like started bosses device was awesome", "111:25", "the training mouse work work concepts", "111:26", "but now brian has really evolved and", "111:28", "developed and said actually there's a", "111:30", "bunch of different ways we can do it and", "111:31", "he has protocols heat you're gonna have", "111:33", "to ask him but he is the one that could", "111:34", "say like do this for this thing do", "111:36", "exactly this way for this thing you got", "111:37", "this adaptation you want this effect Wow", "111:39", "he has it all dialed in I go to a cryo", "111:42", "chamber", "111:43", "cryotherapy place we put a surgical mask", "111:46", "on earmuffs and your whole body's", "111:48", "immersed it's not just below the neck oh", "111:51", "yeah", "111:51", "yeah but you see those huh and what I", "111:53", "use the wim HOF breathing method it's", "111:55", "almost like somebody made it 50 degrees", "111:57", "warmer oh yeah", "111:58", "it's ways I just got back from Montauk I", "112:00", "spent three days and jumping and ice", "112:01", "baths the whole time out there but we", "112:04", "actually have multiple protocols so", "112:06", "that's more akin to most someone call", "112:07", "the Breath of Fire is this when you're", "112:09", "with Dennis said yeah we were out on an", "112:11", "event out there with Laird Hamilton and", "112:12", "those folks are Brian also they layered", "112:14", "in Gabi and Brian Pat Gabby Reece and", "112:16", "Laird Hamilton started a company called", "112:18", "xpt that kind of puts a lot of this", "112:21", "lifestyle stuff into practice and so", "112:22", "they put on these live events they also", "112:24", "sent me some of their new super food", "112:26", "stuff that they add let's see the", "112:28", "creamer stuff yeah really good amazing", "112:30", "yeah it's a little espresso based powder", "112:32", "plus superstar - I like it it's", "112:35", "fantastic", "112:36", "yeah so I will work with thanks Laird or", "112:38", "a couple of years since they got started", "112:42", "but we go out there we do these things", "112:44", "and so we can say okay we'll get through", "112:46", "the Breath of Fire protocol and you'll", "112:48", "feel like wow you get hot you get warmed", "112:51", "up there's other ways we can do it", "112:53", "that'll bring you back down where you're", "112:54", "like yeah I'm gonna take a nap", "112:55", "there's euphoria ones where you can get", "112:57", "like wow I'm feel like I'm on", "112:59", "psychedelics right now super high call", "113:01", "atrophic breathing bunch of apnea stuff", "113:04", "pranayama stuff all these things can", "113:07", "have different outcomes depending on", "113:10", "what you're looking for so they've Brian", "113:13", "has got the system developing our like", "113:15", "it's that's what he did with John the", "113:17", "first one he did", "113:18", "it was like 10 o'clock at night and he's", "113:19", "like alright let me relax you to kind of", "113:21", "bring it down maybe I call this amazing", "113:23", "but things like I actually got trained", "113:24", "right now so I couldn't get me back up", "113:25", "it's a garden go back that way let's", "113:28", "load him back up", "113:29", "so is there any benefit stuff to using", "113:33", "those breathing techniques versus an o2", "113:35", "trainer or is it different situations", "113:38", "exactly it's situation based there's", "113:39", "things I like so you mentioned what boss", "113:41", "says of the opening valve at the end of", "113:43", "the o2 trainer allows you to dump out", "113:45", "carbon dioxide mm-hmm okay", "113:46", "the training master for example wouldn't", "113:49", "right right so it's not right or wrong", "113:51", "it's just depending on what you're", "113:53", "looking to do because one thing you can", "113:55", "train your body to do is how well do you", "113:57", "perform when you've generated a bunch of", "113:59", "carbon dioxide right so a carbon dioxide", "114:01", "is what actually makes you feel like you", "114:03", "want to breathe right it's not lack of", "114:05", "oxygen right right so I can put you in a", "114:09", "situation where you get a bunch of", "114:10", "carbon dioxide buildup and if I don't", "114:12", "let you dump it then you're gonna", "114:14", "fatigue a lot faster but that's not", "114:17", "necessarily a bad thing you could learn", "114:18", "to then deal with a lot of fatigue deal", "114:21", "with it mentally psychologically as well", "114:23", "as physiological ii really there's gonna", "114:25", "be adaptations so because of the fact", "114:26", "that your body has more carbon dioxide", "114:28", "in the system you your body adapts to", "114:31", "process that carbon dioxide more", "114:33", "efficiently this would be the assumption", "114:34", "like yet to be scientifically shown oh", "114:36", "but this is you know where we were this", "114:39", "is the thought process hmm you can feel", "114:41", "this intuitively you're like wow and", "114:43", "it's also a way for us to get a lot of", "114:45", "training volume in or sorry a lot of", "114:48", "cardiovascular training in because your", "114:49", "heart rate goes way up without actually", "114:51", "doing a lot of physical work and so for", "114:54", "MMA guys that this is what we're looking", "114:55", "for sometimes because of physical work", "114:57", "and their training camps so high we", "114:59", "can't add any more volume to them is", "115:01", "gonna beat them up so now we can get", "115:03", "them a cardiovascular workout and that's", "115:05", "easy on the joints and ligaments and the", "115:07", "bones", "115:07", "hmm so the other approach would be dump", "115:10", "all the co2 or do other things like", "115:12", "nasal breathing only so the whole", "115:15", "workout you're only allowed to breathe", "115:16", "through your nose", "115:17", "when you breathe through your nose it", "115:19", "actually can release nitric oxide which", "115:22", "is a basal dilator so this is why when", "115:24", "you only when you breathe through your", "115:26", "nose", "115:26", "not only but especially when you breathe", "115:28", "through your nose", "115:29", "huh why does your body produce more", "115:32", "nitric oxide when you breathe through", "115:34", "nose yeah I don't know that's weird", "115:37", "because you would think that just", "115:38", "breathing like wim HOF I was asking them", "115:39", "like breathing yeah he's bringing", "115:41", "breathe anyway yeah he says like any", "115:44", "hole I don't care yeah but so again", "115:47", "woman's not wrong or anything like that", "115:49", "but whims style is great but there's", "115:53", "many styles as the point I guess like", "115:55", "he's great we've done some science stuff", "115:57", "together but how do you feel about", "115:58", "saunas same thing amazing benefits their", "116:02", "potential but there's no free passes in", "116:05", "Physiology so when you get something", "116:07", "you're probably coming at a compromise", "116:08", "of something else", "116:09", "what would the compromise be when you do", "116:11", "a sauna to know well we just don't have", "116:13", "enough evidence on this stuff we know we", "116:15", "focused on the heat shock proteins", "116:16", "that's like everyone knows about those", "116:18", "by now right the ability to deal with", "116:22", "uncomfort the Teague like there's a lot", "116:24", "of stuff the difficult is when you run a", "116:27", "scientific study you get one or two or", "116:29", "three variables you don't get a thousand", "116:30", "right so we focus on the one or two that", "116:33", "you're like wow this is moving something", "116:35", "here but I mean just like the example we", "116:38", "went over the cold soak oh yeah it's", "116:40", "great for this or actually it's terrible", "116:42", "then people say no they want to make", "116:43", "blanket statements like heats good or", "116:45", "colds good or colds bad well as we study", "116:47", "it more we start to finding out well", "116:49", "actually it's good for this it's good", "116:50", "for this and it's bad for that not", "116:51", "nothing that so we'd have to assume", "116:53", "sauna would be the same way there has to", "116:55", "be consequences to it it just depends on", "116:57", "application but there's got to be some", "117:00", "sort of benefits in terms of recovery", "117:02", "right so do you think that someone", "117:04", "should do maybe like cryo one day sauna", "117:07", "the next should they do them on the same", "117:08", "day like so for example a fighter in", "117:11", "camp I generally don't go out of my way", "117:12", "to recommend sauna because they already", "117:14", "get really hot in training hmm you're", "117:16", "grappling especially if they're doing", "117:17", "key stuff they're getting heat shock", "117:18", "protein I don't know there's a study", "117:22", "they're doing right now at Harvard", "117:23", "apparently somebody was telling me about", "117:25", "it the other day where they're they're", "117:28", "concentrating on hot yoga and the", "117:30", "benefits of hot yoga and heat shock", "117:32", "proteins yeah I'm sure they're gonna", "117:33", "find a lot yeah like that that's pretty", "117:35", "I mean that ship sailed a little bit", "117:38", "like we're confident something there's a", "117:39", "lot of detail to work out but somes", "117:41", "going on", "117:41", "probably something similar to sauna", "117:43", "right so I generally say for people like", "117:47", "you and like me I don't go out of my way", "117:49", "to do too much sauna work because of the", "117:51", "way I train I get really hot and", "117:54", "sometimes we'll train specifically with", "117:55", "a little bit more clothing sometimes and", "117:57", "get kind of like one stead of sitting a", "117:59", "sauna for 45 minutes let me wear a", "118:00", "little bit extra clothing during my", "118:01", "training session and get real hot doctor", "118:04", "but for the average people I think it's", "118:05", "a fantastic modality because there may", "118:08", "be only working out once a week or less", "118:10", "and you gave you can get them hot and we", "118:12", "can actually work on those health", "118:13", "benefits while we're building good", "118:16", "quality habits and we can eventually", "118:18", "lead him down the path to more exercises", "118:20", "Emanuele Stuart used to run the Kronk", "118:22", "gym he used to crank the temperature up", "118:25", "in the gym over a hundred degrees that", "118:27", "was his thing like he wanted guys to box", "118:29", "yeah like in essentially like hot yoga", "118:32", "room well there's a couple of things to", "118:34", "that I've done a lot of that in my life", "118:36", "and I used to hate it we used to just", "118:38", "fight for the door like wait for the", "118:39", "round to go over wrestling wrestling", "118:41", "practice I really used to do MMA with it", "118:43", "all the time and like the problem was", "118:45", "ooh scary because the floor is water oh", "118:47", "yeah and you're like I'm not kicking I", "118:49", "can you're terrified just that's not", "118:51", "good it was awful hey I hated it that's", "118:53", "real bad for kicking let's skip those", "118:54", "practices a lot you hahaha but so", "118:58", "example I don't think that's", "119:01", "particularly needed with the exception", "119:02", "one time when Pat Cummins fought in", "119:04", "Brazil it was like 110 outside and it", "119:06", "was 80% humidity or something which", "119:08", "fight was that ah it was um", "119:11", "Cordero failfish yeah yeah it was", "119:15", "outdoors I think no it was indoors but", "119:17", "everything was open oh that's what it", "119:19", "was yeah so super super hot now we did", "119:22", "like train for that or anticipate that", "119:23", "but you could see if you knew you're", "119:25", "fighting a venue like that yeah like", "119:27", "what they used to do in Bodog and Costa", "119:29", "Rica like oh yeah they would fight on", "119:30", "the heat job Yeah right just horde", "119:33", "outside so you could see like well in", "119:34", "that situation maybe it's needed but", "119:36", "mm-hmm", "119:36", "you're fighting and you know Vegas or", "119:39", "something endorsment and maybe we don't", "119:41", "need it for that right but that doesn't", "119:44", "mean you couldn't implement it once or", "119:45", "twice mmm I wouldn't buy my way to do it", "119:47", "though right so it wouldn't be a daily", "119:49", "thing no because what's gonna happen is", "119:52", "you're gonna compromise performance", "119:55", "pacing is a real problem is being a", "119:56", "great example this to Dennis was a bunch", "119:58", "of people if you fight an environment", "120:00", "like that your pace and the amount of", "120:03", "output you can do is gonna slow way down", "120:04", "in the gym right can be hot you're gonna", "120:07", "gas out and then when you go to fight in", "120:09", "your fight and it's temperature", "120:10", "controlled you're not used to that pace", "120:13", "so if you're used to fighting at the", "120:15", "pace that it takes for you to sustain", "120:16", "ten rounds of sparring in the gym at 110", "120:18", "degrees and then we come in and you and", "120:20", "I fight and I'm ready to go with this", "120:21", "beat you're not ready for that pace mmm", "120:23", "so it's not that you don't physically", "120:24", "have the conditioning but you're just", "120:25", "like oh my I'm just not home this guy's", "120:27", "is and you know you don't feel right so", "120:29", "you have to be careful of training too", "120:31", "far outside of what you're actually", "120:32", "gonna encounter mm which is you know", "120:35", "some of these guys run to those problems", "120:36", "when they do you know I'm gonna spar 10", "120:37", "around so that I can go five easy yeah", "120:40", "yeah but your pays for your five is way", "120:42", "different than pays for your 10 hmm so", "120:45", "you have to be careful there a lot of", "120:49", "questions man physiology dude dad that", "120:51", "is part of the problem right that there", "120:53", "are so many variables there are so many", "120:54", "questions that there is no real", "120:55", "definitive protocol to follow no there's", "120:58", "a bunch of different ones", "120:59", "the pursuit like though the way I always", "121:00", "say it is the truth is mostly a lack of", "121:04", "perspective so when you think that you", "121:07", "are on some unbreakable truth it's", "121:10", "because you haven't looked at it from a", "121:11", "big enough perspective mmm for the most", "121:15", "part right and there's some I'll put it", "121:17", "this way in in biological truth that's", "121:21", "almost always true and physics truth oh", "121:24", "that's a lot less true like we're pretty", "121:26", "sure gravity's real like we're pretty", "121:28", "sure right and we can mechanics sure", "121:30", "water is good for you pretty sure now", "121:33", "quantum mechanically those get kind of", "121:35", "weird right but for the most part that", "121:36", "is true but science in terms of", "121:38", "biological or medical is a lot less true", "121:42", "I mean how many times we have to see", "121:43", "that where it's like this is true this", "121:45", "is true for 50 years", "121:46", "oops it's not is this all fun for you do", "121:49", "you I mean it seems like you're very", "121:50", "passionate about it but I mean it's it", "121:52", "also seems like wow it could be kind of", "121:54", "stressful having so many variables and", "121:56", "possibilities and I don't I don't think", "121:58", "stress is even close it's I would say", "122:00", "99% fun like it's stress for me in terms", "122:03", "of I don't want like it would break my", "122:05", "heart if I gave someone the wrong advice", "122:07", "and it ruined their career", "122:08", "like that would be the stress stress in", "122:11", "terms of being right or like saying it", "122:13", "much some stuff and be improved I don't", "122:14", "care about that at all yeah that is an", "122:16", "issue with a lot of trainers right like", "122:18", "we're they giving bad advice and yeah", "122:20", "you see it play out in a fight I I mean", "122:23", "one of the reasons I I used to do a lot", "122:25", "of professional athletes and other", "122:26", "sports work with other ones I gave that", "122:29", "almost up entirely and I gave up I've", "122:30", "done some actors and things like that", "122:32", "but I generally shy away from that even", "122:34", "though the the money is far far higher", "122:36", "for me and those things but I did it", "122:39", "because like these MMA folks like I have", "122:42", "a real passion for someone who's gonna", "122:43", "put all that on the line and they're", "122:45", "gonna risk everything and they're gonna", "122:47", "go out there and that is more exciting", "122:49", "to me and I'm like that's a fun a really", "122:51", "fun investment in me in it and it's", "122:53", "worth me investing my emotion I mean", "122:55", "when Helen one golden Ryo like I would", "122:57", "just lost it like emotionally I was like", "122:59", "gone for weeks like just exhausted", "123:01", "because I invested so much into that I", "123:03", "don't want to do that for somebody so", "123:05", "they can make an extra million right on", "123:06", "top of that 30 million like it doesn't", "123:08", "motivate me that much so I like working", "123:10", "with these folks and so because of that", "123:12", "like it breaks my heart if you're like", "123:13", "man you gave up everything for this kind", "123:15", "of a living and the best outcome for you", "123:18", "was that you made 20k instead of 10k and", "123:21", "then I lost that for you because I gave", "123:23", "you really bad rehydration advice for", "123:24", "something right that's a stress for me", "123:27", "but the rest of stuff man like it's fun", "123:30", "it's invigorating for me to continue to", "123:32", "be like well we we answered that but now", "123:34", "we don't know this or this like it's", "123:36", "continual progress and and by like I", "123:40", "take Karl Popper stance on this one in", "123:41", "terms of like science is not about", "123:44", "identifying truth it's reducing", "123:46", "uncertainty mmm that's good that's all", "123:50", "it is right I wish I could take credit", "123:51", "for it it's a good way to put it so we", "123:54", "just we get closer and we know more okay", "123:56", "we know this is notice but we're still", "123:57", "do you anticipate a day when we do like", "124:00", "it's when it comes to biomechanics or", "124:02", "well there's no G there are some things", "124:04", "that I would be confident in saying like", "124:06", "basically we know that this is true now", "124:08", "you need to drink water like alright", "124:10", "basically say that that's true we need", "124:12", "to have a lot of vitamin E standard", "124:14", "stuff then those are things I'm", "124:16", "comfortable saying this is basically", "124:17", "true and as we go on we only keep adding", "124:20", "to that list", "124:21", "so more things get piled on now we know", "124:23", "for I told this story also on my podcast", "124:26", "about the history of strength", "124:27", "conditioning and how it went from the", "124:30", "1900s to where it is now and the quick", "124:33", "story is there was a guy named Peter", "124:35", "Karpovich who was a scientist and he was", "124:38", "extremely he was the guy who started the", "124:39", "idea that lifting weights causes you to", "124:41", "lose flexibility and it's bad for your", "124:45", "health and all these things right", "124:46", "this is 1952 54 something like that", "124:50", "and he's a scientist PhD and he calls in", "124:54", "a guy he gets caught a guy named Bob", "124:55", "Hoffman he's called in do you remember", "124:57", "Bob Hoffman you're from the generation", "124:59", "you may remember York barbell muscle and", "125:03", "strength like the magazine okay you may", "125:06", "recognize all this stuff but basically", "125:08", "there was a show and I said bring in", "125:10", "this these weight lifters because back", "125:12", "then weightlifting power that think", "125:13", "bodybuilding was all kind of same thing", "125:14", "is it bring him in and let's put on a", "125:17", "demonstration and so they bring in all", "125:20", "these lifters and they put on this", "125:22", "demonstration in front of the whole", "125:23", "school in front of dr. Karpovich in and", "125:27", "everyone's like oh they're great they're", "125:29", "strong and athletic and everyone knows", "125:30", "like the showdown is coming everyone's", "125:32", "there to watch the show but everyone's", "125:33", "really there to watch like that just", "125:35", "like they are on the internet now it's", "125:36", "like let's watch the shit show", "125:37", "afterwards right so everyone's done and", "125:40", "carpet stands up and he's like it's", "125:43", "great you're strong and got a lot of", "125:44", "muscle and all that but let me ask you a", "125:46",

my", "126:05", "entire career is that strength trainings", "126:07", "bad for you it's unhealthy you lose", "126:08", "flexibility and these dudes the", "126:10", "strongest known world just showed up not", "126:12", "only are they not inflexible but they", "126:14", "just did it splits they're they're", "126:15", "bodybuilders and reigning world", "126:16", "champions so he was at a crossroads",

that well", "126:28", "he does the honorable thing and goes I'm", "126:31", "sorry I'm wrong and changed his entire", "126:34", "career Reese", "126:34", "going on to actually studying strength",

and", "126:47", "then we get less than less than us wrong", "126:49", "so that's really where we're at with", "126:51", "with everything that's an easy example", "126:52", "but if you told somebody 50 years ago", "126:55", "flexibility or strength training makes", "126:56", "you and flexibles they're like wow I", "126:58", "don't know look at this study look at", "126:59", "this study that used to be an issue with", "127:00", "boxing right things to always say boxers", "127:02", "should never strength train till Evander", "127:04", "Holyfield came along with Maggie she'll", "127:05", "stone right and won the title yesterday", "127:08", "yeah the airport looks great", "127:10", "oh man it's crazy huge he was pulling", "127:12", "like a walking out of the bathroom by", "127:13", "himself and he had like his cell phone", "127:15", "up to his ear like I'm on the phone but", "127:16", "I think his cell phone was dead he's", "127:17", "like didn't want anybody talk to him", "127:18",

something busy", "127:27", "yeah hopefully not financially I don't", "127:30", "know a vendor's like pi the biggest", "127:33", "house that exists yeah yeah that fucking", "127:37", "stupendous

think MMA has ever caught up to", "127:52", "that in terms of financially yeah it's", "127:54", "getting close with Conor McGregor", "127:55", "honestly his biggest windfall right now", "127:57", "as a boxing match so you know the the", "128:01", "thing about a Vander that's weird is", "128:03", "that he never got out of shape he looked", "128:06", "fantastic yeah he's still fit he's got", "128:07", "him he's like you plus he's one of the", "128:09", "rare guys and I think he had a fight as", "128:12", "recently as a year ago no oh yeah", "128:14", "yeah Wow find out when Evander", "128:18", "Holyfield's last fight was I really want", "128:20", "to say he had a fight like a year ago", "128:21", "oh that's terrifying yeah but he's okay", "128:24", "it's weird it's not like oh what's this", "128:27", "dude just retired or just got smashed", "128:29", "really bad Hopkins yes yeah that was a", "128:33", "freak incident man that's one of the", "128:35", "things about like why don't they have", "128:37", "pads around the ring case guys fall", "128:39", "through the ropes like I can't imagine", "128:40", "that they didn't they've seen that", "128:43", "happen before guys are getting fucked up", "128:45", "through that before that's all fight", "128:46", "stops it's a right", "128:48", "yeah yeah but that was like a fake", "128:51", "charity boxing match what does it say", "128:54", "those in terms of when is his last fight", "128:58", "yeah but that's not real I think you're", "129:01", "lying Joe like you know just just pull", "129:02", "up is his record", "129:04", "it's Wikipedia record I'm sure there's a", "129:08", "Wikipedia on a van der Holyfield Brian", "129:11", "no Nielsen 2011 okay so six years ago", "129:18", "yeah that's pretty recently in", "129:19", "consideration oh you know what it was I", "129:21", "believe he was planning a comeback a few", "129:24", "years ago and he was having a really", "129:25", "hard time getting licensed oh I think", "129:28", "that's what it was I would still say if", "129:31", "you would ask me I what I said 12 years", "129:32", "ago", "129:32", "hmm like I would've guessed way longer", "129:34", "that well he how old is he now 61 60 oh", "129:43", "okay so 555 yeah so essentially had his", "129:47", "last fight when he was like what 48 49", "129:50", "something that yeah makes sense", "129:52", "that's a stylish okay well I don't know", "129:55", "I don't really remember he's top of that", "129:56", "much you didn't take a lot of shot did", "129:58", "you take a lot of shot oh hell yeah", "129:59", "yeah bruiser yeah I mean he talked took", "130:02", "some he just had a tremendous chin he's", "130:05", "just an unbelievably tough guy and he", "130:07", "unbelievably fit you know that was the", "130:10", "thing about Holyfield was that", "130:11", "unbelievably fit unbelievably game like", "130:14", "when he beat Mike Tyson in the first", "130:15", "fight mm-hmm like I remember it was you", "130:19", "know Kevin James yeah heaven it was", "130:21", "actually over my house we were watching", "130:22", "it together would jumping around", "130:23", "screaming like a bunch of schoolgirls", "130:25", "kids made it it was insane", "130:26", "yeah yeah cuz nobody saw that comment", "130:28", "yeah I was like right yeah that was", "130:31", "amazing yeah he had a spectacular career", "130:33", "though oh he certainly did yeah hope you", "130:36", "still got it together upstairs like", "130:37", "that's just a tough one mm-hmm it", "130:41", "certainly is yeah that it's got to be", "130:43", "weird", "130:43", "I wonder what do you ever have that", "130:45", "conversation with a fighter I do yeah", "130:47", "it's not my role so I don't bring it up", "130:49", "at all right if they ask me unlike a", "130:51", "friendly advice thing and look it will", "130:54", "be very careful with names here but I", "130:57", "generally tell them all to retire like", "130:59", "regardless", "131:00", "my approach is no this is a manaat'", "131:05", "worth the payout in the UFC it's just", "131:07", "not like there is the occasional connor", "131:09", "but this is this is the anomaly that", "131:12", "proves the rule actually so my advice to", "131:14", "all of them is if it's not a good", "131:16", "investment like it is not worth the risk", "131:18", "because even if you get the wind bonus", "131:21", "and the fight of the night one fight", "131:23", "like that", "131:24", "is potentially years and how much income", "131:27", "could you make in those 10 years of", "131:28", "working probably more than that hundred", "131:30", "K well in terms of income for sure but", "131:32", "for a lot of them it's not really what", "131:34", "they're doing it's not doing it for", "131:36", "glory right so for I mean that's but I'm", "131:38", "taking it from a logical perspective I'm", "131:40", "not telling you what to do I'm saying", "131:41", "they like me as your friend I would love", "131:43", "to you to never fight because it's great", "131:45", "but having said that you do that so let", "131:46", "me help you as much as I can to get", "131:47", "there but I mean you can kind of tell -", "131:51", "like if you're if you just don't if", "131:55", "you're not on that x-factor charisma", "131:57", "wise and stuff you're never gonna make", "131:58", "that real like life-changing right we're", "132:00", "just talking about money though in terms", "132:01", "of damage and you notice in terms of", "132:05", "physical performance when you're seeing", "132:06", "an athlete move around I haven't gotten", "132:09", "to that I haven't gotten anybody like", "132:10", "that word if you had someone come to you", "132:11", "and say hey I'm thinking about you know", "132:14", "when I get out I'm not exactly sure when", "132:17", "what do you think yeah I mean I would I", "132:19", "would look at them from the performance", "132:21", "side of it I wouldn't look at brain", "132:22", "damage at all I would say well here your", "132:23", "numbers in the room second down to other", "132:25", "folks we've had in this room and you're", "132:27", "if you're far below their performance", "132:29", "wise I would say you might have a", "132:30", "performance problem in terms of you", "132:31", "might not be talented enough physically", "132:33", "to compete like I'm not gonna make a", "132:35", "comment about your other reasons to", "132:37", "retire but if yeah if I tested you", "132:38", "across the board and you were terrible", "132:40", "at everything mm-hmm", "132:42", "then I might be like well physically", "132:45", "from my perspective I don't know if you", "132:47", "have what it takes anymore", "132:48", "right do you see a deterioration in", "132:50", "physical skills from like punishment I", "132:53", "don't know if I could really say that", "132:54", "but that's just because I don't like I", "132:57", "don't have enough exposure to enough of", "132:59", "those folks to make a qualified comment", "133:01", "on that over long periods of time like", "133:02", "yeah yeah I would need dozens and dozens", "133:04", "of guys over years to really fairly", "133:06", "what's the longest you've ever worked", "133:07", "with a guy", "133:09", "five six years probably yeah probably", "133:12", "six years that's a lot of time it is and", "133:14", "it's not like like some of them is not", "133:17", "everything I'm not talking them every", "133:19", "day and sometimes it's like once a camp", "133:21", "generally what my goal is is to teach", "133:25", "them how to think as much through the", "133:26", "stuff as they can and so ideally they", "133:29", "don't need me after more than a couple", "133:30", "of camps other than a few check-ins", "133:32", "right I want to come to lab get this", "133:34", "tested I got a hunch about this or we", "133:36", "did this type of training for six weeks", "133:37", "we think we're addressing this problem", "133:40", "can we come to get it tested to see if", "133:41", "it actually got better yeah no problem", "133:43", "but a lot of the other stuff I do is", "133:45", "like I said it's so much usually helping", "133:48", "them calm down through all the nonsense", "133:50", "that I can give them a settling presence", "133:52", "in terms of you this is not something", "133:53", "you should worry about her right get to", "133:55", "here so but yeah multiple five six years", "133:58", "and we've got data we got biopsy data", "134:01", "off them from over the years which has", "134:03", "been very very interesting actually that", "134:05", "was one of the first reasons I wanted to", "134:06", "get into the sport because I'm like I", "134:07", "wanted to biopsy these dudes yeah that's", "134:09", "got to be really as a scientist got to", "134:11", "be really an interesting opportunity", "134:13", "yeah we had I had one fighter it was", "134:16", "pretty crazy because he's a he was a", "134:18", "wrestler and a very very he war he wins", "134:21", "through attrition like that's his style", "134:23", "he's not like a knockout artisan like", "134:24", "that and he was almost 70 75 percent", "134:27", "fast which well yeah and then we also", "134:32", "look this other thing so one of the", "134:34", "things that we measure in our lab is", "134:35", "called mild nuclear domain so the", "134:38", "nucleus is what holds the DNA and it", "134:41", "tells the cell to grow shrink thigh mech", "134:43", "repair well like human violet or human", "134:45", "muscle is really unique it's one of the", "134:48", "only cells on all of biology that is", "134:50", "multinucleated so that means it's got", "134:52", "not only more than one but it's got", "134:54", "thousands of nuclei per cell the obvious", "134:58", "advantages that allows us a lot more", "135:01", "plasticity so we can recover and repair", "135:04", "and adapt and adjust really really", "135:06", "quickly which is why we see people's", "135:07", "fiber type change in a matter of weeks", "135:09", "paper that came out last year showing", "135:12", "actually a high-fat high-sugar diet can", "135:13", "change fiber type we've seen carbon", "135:16", "dioxide concentrations alter fiber type", "135:18", "things like this so the nucleus is", "135:21", "really interesting because", "135:23", "the more nuclei you have the faster you", "135:26", "recover it's also what determines how", "135:29", "big a muscle will grow you've heard of", "135:31", "like muscle memory yeah", "135:32", "so that's this is what's doing muscle", "135:35", "memory that makes sense I always", "135:38", "wondered if that was real uh well", "135:40", "working right now through it a lot of", "135:43", "people are but the old theory would be a", "135:45", "satellite cell would come in they would", "135:47", "turn into a nuclei and the cell will", "135:50", "only grow as big as the amount of nuclei", "135:53", "that are around it or that inside of it", "135:55", "right and so what that basically means", "135:57", "is there's a certain domain or certain", "136:01", "size that each nucleus will control and", "136:03", "it won't exceed that size because it", "136:05", "loses control so if if you are all three", "136:08", "of us and you know we're all the nuclei", "136:11", "and this whole room was one cell if we", "136:13", "wanted to expand the wall we would have", "136:15", "to bring in another nucleus because", "136:17", "you'd be like dude like it's too much", "136:18", "area to control so when you go through", "136:21", "like about a training a year or", "136:22", "something of heavy lifting and we add", "136:24", "those those satellite cells that turn", "136:26", "into my own nuclei and we expand the", "136:28", "size well we used to think like if we", "136:31", "stopped training and this and the room", "136:32", "gets smaller we used to think that all", "136:34", "right like time to kick Jamie other room", "136:36", "he's gone but now what looked like", "136:38", "happening is he's staying around so then", "136:41", "when I go to retrain I've got more of", "136:43", "those nuclei right there and so it's", "136:45", "easier so I got excited hit the mic it's", "136:47", "easier for me to expand my size because", "136:48", "the nuclei there oh that makes sense", "136:50", "okay so there's actual scientific reason", "136:53", "for muscle memory yeah and you can", "136:55", "increase the amount of nuclei just by", "136:57", "increasing the size of the muscle and", "136:59", "that makes it easier to go back to that", "137:02", "if you lose some muscle well right the", "137:04", "the model nuclei would allow for the", "137:05", "muscles get bigger yeah so a little bit", "137:07", "universe but basic thing dude this was", "137:10", "really fascinating anything else to add", "137:12", "before you get out of here um the book", "137:14", "man like I got a book out on all this", "137:16", "stuff called unplugged evolving from", "137:19", "technology to upgrade your fitness", "137:21", "performance and consciousness isn't on", "137:24", "Amazon although all that stuff is there", "137:26", "an audiobook available there is but I'm", "137:28", "tell you no sorry there's a Kindle good", "137:30", "I would highly recommend you don't get", "137:32", "it because the Kindle no you mean that's", "137:34", "the digital version", "137:35", "right why get the hardcopy why because", "137:38", "the book is really a guide for how to", "137:40", "use some of these training technologies", "137:41", "uh-huh in your training and how we can", "137:44", "ruin your training how it can help your", "137:45", "training so a part of that is the", "137:48", "importance of doing a couple of things", "137:50", "getting back to nature and how that the", "137:52", "physiology behind how that helps as well", "137:55", "as this concept of choosing suffering", "137:58", "and choosing discomfort and how that's", "138:00", "physiologically important for you so a", "138:03", "part of the book is built in a way where", "138:06", "the photos the layout the quality of the", "138:08", "paper is all part of the reading", "138:10", "experience they don't have that in like", "138:12", "Kindle with the photographs no it's not", "138:14", "even close this it's you know it's all", "138:16", "black and white the texture the papers", "138:18", "do what if you have one of those Kindle", "138:20", "HDS", "138:20", "the ones that are digital and maybe I", "138:24", "mean yeah maybe they're not good but", "138:26", "you're saying though", "138:27", "but you recommend the hard yeah I mean I", "138:29", "don't change I don't really care like", "138:30", "right for the experience of yeah it's", "138:32", "it's still keep it it's not expensive", "138:34", "what's the physiological benefit of", "138:36", "getting back to nature oh we have so", "138:38", "much yeah it's pretty incredible in", "138:41", "terms of everything from visualization", "138:46", "or", "138:46", "sorry eyesight did you listen to that", "138:49", "amazing podcast eyesight yeah", "138:52", "radio lab did one on the color blue I", "138:55", "didn't hear that one which are called", "138:57", "this is a teaser I could tell you the", "138:59", "whole story", "138:59", "what's it called didn't I don't know the", "139:02", "episode find it if you google the radio", "139:04", "lab episode on the color blue okay but", "139:06", "basically we as humans didn't really", "139:09", "recognize the color blue until the Bible", "139:11", "what yeah so we had the cones and like", "139:15", "the physiology didn't change but we", "139:17", "didn't have a word for the color blue", "139:18", "until the Bible came along so if you", "139:20", "look at anything past there prior to", "139:22", "that yeah that's a problem why isn't the", "139:26", "sky blue on radio yep exactly so what", "139:32", "what they basically identified is we", "139:33", "didn't have a separate color for her", "139:35", "several word for color blue because we", "139:36", "didn't differentiate blue shades so", "139:38", "wasn't important for the world because", "139:39", "blue doesn't happen very frequently in", "139:42", "biology in nature it wasn't until we had", "139:45", "textiles and we started printing and", "139:47", "making cloth and paper and stuff like", "139:49", "that we had all these different dyes and", "139:50", "shades of blue so then we developed", "139:52", "different shades of blue and different", "139:53", "colors so because that we started", "139:55", "perceiving and focusing on different", "139:57", "shades of blue so now the average person", "140:00", "that comes in the room and be able to", "140:01", "identify all these different blues or", "140:03", "prior to this we didn't care about it we", "140:05", "didn't focus on it so we all just saw", "140:06", "that as one color blue so things like", "140:09", "that are important so what are we paying", "140:11", "attention to what are we being conscious", "140:13", "of what are we perceiving what are we", "140:14", "focusing on has a direct influence on", "140:17", "our physiology it's very adaptable to", "140:20", "those things so how does that make like", "140:22", "going to nature so if we think about it", "140:26", "from this way what's happening in the", "140:27", "exposure when we're in this artificial", "140:29", "environment versus being in the external", "140:31",

"140:40", "aspect which is we talk to a lot of", "140:43", "people Tim Ferriss wrote a section or", "140:45", "that little interview thing for it", "140:47", "Steven Kotler did one as well and they", "140:49", "talk about the things like getting into", "140:50", "flow state and the stress relief of it", "140:53", "and all the other psychological benefits", "140:55", "that we have from detaching a little bit", "140:57", "from our constant tech exposure dopamine", "141:01", "as another great example right so if we", "141:04", "look at the dopamine rush that we get", "141:06", "from the constant exposure not from the", "141:09", "actual tech but from things like oh I", "141:10", "want to look at my likes I want to", "141:12", "continue look at this that's completely", "141:14", "different than when we didn't get out in", "141:16", "nature and expose ourselves to", "141:17", "physiological elements similar to the", "141:20", "cold in the hot and thirsty", "141:21", "the hungry I mean you've been out in the", "141:24", "woods to stuff before like you know what", "141:25", "it feels like going a full day without", "141:27", "food or being extremely cold for a few", "141:29", "days and then getting back and you're", "141:32", "like the for yeah like the sensations", "141:34", "like you can't really well you can but", "141:35", "it's really beneficial to have ourself", "141:37", "exposed to that and it's a problem now", "141:41", "but really the book is about I wait 20", "141:44", "years and think about the problem it's", "141:46", "gonna be in 20 years when this", "141:48",
