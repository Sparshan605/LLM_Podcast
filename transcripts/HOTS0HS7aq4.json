50 so you turn", "00:49", "50 mm-hmm I wouldn't have thought you", "00:51", "were 50 I would have figured you're", "00:53", "about 41 42 well that's kind of you well", "00:57", "my brother's the

the second of the", "09:25", "pathways and so I take animun and", "09:27", "research all for that and then the third", "09:29", "one is called mTOR which is a pathway in", "09:33", "the body that

"10:07", "of like diet do you follow well I I try", "10:10", "to not eat too much it's pretty easy to", "10:13", "overeat so I try to skip one or two", "10:15", "meals a day", "10:17", "I avoid sugars and carbs I try to run", "10:22", "once a week I do workouts on the weekend", "10:24", "like you I love saunas I like to put my", "10:28", "body in some temperature stress so I go", "10:29", "heat and then I jump in a cold bath", "10:31", "mm-hmm back and forth that that works", "10:33", "well for yeast we can do that in lab and", "10:35", "they live 30% longer so there's all that", "10:39", "you have generally generally I eat", "10:42", "normally do you ever try going from", "10:43", "sauna to cryotherapy no I haven't tried", "10:47", "actual cryotherapy just to oh you", "10:49", "haven't done it at all no you want to do", "10:51", "it today", "10:51", "harvey got one yeah yeah we'll take you", "10:53", "take you down the street there's a great", "10:55", "one because it's there's different kinds", "10:58", "and some of them are from the neck down", "10:59", "where they're using liquid nitrogen the", "11:01", "other ones they actually freeze the air", "11:03", "so when they're they're using the", "11:05", "nitrogen to freeze the air and they're", "11:07", "pumping in air that's 240 degrees below", "11:09", "zero and you're you know you're gonna do", "11:11", "about two minutes I do three because I", "11:13", "do it all the time but it's awesome I do", "11:16", "three and then I take ten minutes off", "11:18", "and I go back in for another three yeah", "11:20", "makes sense and what you're doing to", "11:21", "your body when you do that we think is", "11:23", "to activate these longevity pathways", "11:25", "like this or two ends yeah and and", "11:27", "that's really the trick is to activate", "11:29", "your body's defenses against aging I", "11:31", "mean the old theories about aging you've", "11:33", "got to throw them out most people at", "11:35", "parties will tell you oh antioxidants", "11:36", "free radicals DNA damage or mutations", "11:39", "that is all for the most part in correct", "11:43", "that antioxidants cause DNA damage no", "11:47", "that's true that it repairs DNA damage", "11:50", "well antioxidants have been a rather big", "11:53", "failure in the aging field but", "11:54", "resveratrol is an antioxidant correct", "11:56", "it's a mild antioxidant but it doesn't", "11:58", "work by being in Antioch so what does it", "12:00", "work what is the pathway it steps on the", "12:03", "accelerator pedal of these sirtuin", "12:04", "enzyme okay and so it's directly", "12:06", "controlling the body's defenses against", "12:09", "aging so as we discussed it or as people", "12:12", "discussed it as an antioxidant it was", "12:14", "just a mild form of antibiotics", "12:16", "antioxidant but it didn't so much more", "12:18", "right and we know this because if you", "12:20", "create a yeast cell or a worm or a mouse", "12:23", "and then you knock out the gene for the", "12:26", "sirtuin now reversal doesn't help the", "12:28", "animal anymore that's interesting", "12:30", "because when people talk about wine", "12:31", "that's the one thing they say the", "12:32", "resveratrol is and antioxidants really", "12:34", "good for you yeah this is one of those", "12:36", "open myths that never goes away and", "12:37", "still fuels a billion dollar industry", "12:39", "but what we're finding is that the", "12:41", "molecules in plants like resveratrol", "12:43", "first of all that we think they're", "12:44", "produced by plants because the plants", "12:46", "are benefiting from the stress we call", "12:49", "it hormesis a little bit of stress is", "12:50", "good for you what doesn't kill you makes", "12:52", "you stronger kind of thing and hormesis", "12:54", "was discovered oh about 60 70 years ago", "12:58", "when people were spraying herbicides on", "13:00", "plants and a little bit of herbicide", "13:01", "actually made them stronger and we think", "13:04", "that these molecules and plants are", "13:05", "similar they make the plant stronger", "13:07", "during times of stress so if you stress", "13:09", "a grape", "13:10", "that's four winemaking you'll get great", "13:12", "wine but you also get a lot of", "13:15", "resveratrol and so when we ingest that", "13:17", "resveratrol from the plants", "13:19", "we get the same health benefits because", "13:21", "the plants are activating their sirtuin", "13:23", "pathways and we have the sirtuins and", "13:25", "they activate us as well", "13:26", "ah interesting interesting so low carb", "13:30", "low sugar any specific type of protein", "13:34", "do you limit your amount of protein yeah", "13:36", "I mean I enjoy eating mammals just as", "13:39", "much as anybody but I try to avoid them", "13:42", "for the main or two main reasons one is", "13:44", "that there's this TMAO a molecule that", "13:47", "seems to cause heart disease TMAO yeah", "13:50", "yeah and how is it linked heart disease", "13:56", "is these epidemiology studies I forget", "13:59", "but I do recall that the study was able", "14:01", "to give the TMAO to animals and they", "14:04", "developed heart disease so it's somehow", "14:06", "causing it I forget exactly how it might", "14:09", "be damaging the genome that's my", "14:10", "recollection with omnivores or predators", "14:14", "I think as red meat is the culprit right", "14:18", "so are they giving this to rats are they", "14:20", "giving this to there was a male study", "14:22", "again so I mean mice might be different", "14:23", "from humans of course yeah", "14:25", "but the other problem with with meat in", "14:27", "general from from animals is that", "14:29", "there's a lot of mean always in there", "14:30", "and it's easy to eat a lot of meat and", "14:33", "so if you have high levels of amino", "14:35", "acids it will activate this mTOR pathway", "14:38", "one of those three longevity pathways", "14:41", "and you don't want that you don't want", "14:43", "that you don't want that because mTOR", "14:44", "has evolved to sense times of adversity", "14:47", "and stress and hunger so why do people", "14:49", "see a performance benefit when they", "14:52", "consume branched chain amino acids", "14:55", "really good question so in the short run", "14:59", "just like taking testosterone it will", "15:01", "give you performance benefits but we", "15:04", "think in the long run it will actually", "15:07", "come back to bite you so how will blend", "15:09", "branched chain amino acids come back to", "15:10", "bite you so branch chain amino acids", "15:12", "will activate this mTOR pathway and when", "15:18", "we do that in animals we actually we", "15:20", "reduce their lifespan so it's the", "15:21", "opposite you want to keep those levels", "15:23", "low that's interesting that seems I mean", "15:27", "for a dummy like me it seems", "15:28", "counterintuitive because what's making", "15:30", "you perform better", "15:32", "you would see you would think especially", "15:34", "something like amino-acids a natural", "15:36", "part of the human body you would think", "15:37", "that would be beneficial you're adding", "15:39", "to your body something that it needs", "15:40", "yeah you would but but what you should", "15:43", "consider is that it's a trade-off", "15:45", "there's a theory that's probably correct", "15:49", "it's the sum Tom Kirkwood's to your", "15:52", "theory called the disposable soma and", "15:54", "our bodies want to do one of two things", "15:56", "either want to grow really fast and", "15:58", "reproduce fast build up a lot of muscle", "16:01", "cells divide that's great in the short", "16:03", "run you know you'd be fertile you can", "16:06", "run but actually that is at the expense", "16:08", "of hunkering down and building a long", "16:10", "lasting body and then it's a trade-off", "16:12", "over time and so animals that grow fast", "16:15", "and reproduce fast like a mouse will", "16:17", "only have a short lifespan or as a whale", "16:20", "that grows slowly and reproduces slowly", "16:23", "will live a long time interesting so the", "16:26", "idea is you're you're limiting your", "16:30", "calories you're limiting your", "16:31", "carbohydrates you're limiting your", "16:33", "protein you're limiting your amino acids", "16:35", "but you're ramping up on all these", "16:38", "beneficial molecules right these these", "16:41", "pathways that have evolved since the", "16:44", "beginning of life to make us live longer", "16:46", "during adversity so we can thrive when", "16:48", "times come back that's good do you take", "16:50", "into consideration quality of life", "16:53", "versus length of life like is there a", "16:55", "like a sweet spot yeah that well it's", "16:58", "hard to ask the mice how they feel but", "17:01", "they we do test them and we do frailty", "17:03", "studies and we can see that they've got", "17:05", "better memory and they can run further", "17:07", "on a treadmill they're stronger those", "17:10", "kind of things they see better and you", "17:12", "know we think that that probably means", "17:13", "they're happier as well and when you're", "17:16", "taking in protein so if you're not", "17:18",

should be", "24:14", "classified as a disease we should think", "24:15", "of it as a disease I know why why", "24:18", "shouldn't we everything else that goes", "24:20", "on in the body over time that's bad for", "24:22", "us is considered a disease do you know", "24:25", "why aging isn't can", "24:26", "disease because it happens to everybody", "24:28", "exactly mmm that's the only reason well", "24:31", "it happens to most people 90% of people", "24:33", "in developed but why is that a reason to", "24:35", "say oh it's natural we should just deal", "24:36", "with it we used to say there about", "24:39", "cancer and we used to say it about dying", "24:40", "for an infection when you say it happens", "24:42", "to 90% of the people in the developed", "24:44", "world what happens the other ten they", "24:46", "die", "24:46", "hey pipe boss I guess okay I see what", "24:48", "you're saying so they die young yeah", "24:50", "okay just clarifying yeah I agree I mean", "24:55", "it's been disi it's it's it's a problem", "24:58", "right aging is a problem I saw an old", "25:00", "gentleman yesterday and it was painful", "25:03", "just to watch this poor guy walk you", "25:05", "know hunched over and just struggling to", "25:08", "move at an incredibly slow pace that", "25:09", "seems like a person with a disease well", "25:12", "it is and imagine if we were on a planet", "25:14", "NOW oh you know an island where", "25:17", "everybody leaves 300 years and we'd show", "25:20", "up and you and I in our you know midlife", "25:22", "we're starting to look old already", "25:24", "they're gonna look at us and say what is", "25:26", "wrong with you guys we need to treat you", "25:28", "emergent Lee we need to call this a new", "25:31", "type of syndrome right and it's only", "25:33", "because we all tend to go through this", "25:36", "that we think it's acceptable but I", "25:38", "would argue it's the biggest threat to", "25:40", "the healthcare system is the biggest", "25:43", "threat to the world's economy actually", "25:44", "is the inability of us to treat people", "25:48", "in their old age and keep them healthy", "25:49", "mm-hmm now some people look at it a", "25:53", "different way and their consideration is", "25:56", "that there's an overpopulation problem", "25:58", "as it is and folks like you want to want", "26:01", "to walk around living to be 300 years", "26:03", "old have a gang kids you could create a", "26:06", "mess all right well I have three kids", "26:10", "but that's enough that's more than I was", "26:12", "going to have but yeah it we do that you", "26:15", "have to do the math though how much", "26:16", "would the population grow and we I'm", "26:20", "actually working with a number of people", "26:21", "to try and calculate this number of", "26:24", "economists in London that we're working", "26:26", "on so this is this is really a problem", "26:29", "I agree with you that if this comes and", "26:31", "I would actually say when this comes", "26:33", "when this comes is it I mean it's coming", "26:35", "there's there's dozens of companies", "26:36", "working on drugs", "26:38", "the sciences here so let's say it's", "26:40", "coming anyway so we have to deal with", "26:42", "this how are we going to deal with it", "26:44", "well let's first of all understand what", "26:45", "the future looks like", "26:46", "we can't look backwards alright because", "26:49", "no one's ever invented this stuff before", "26:50", "so we have to look forwards what's the", "26:52", "world look like in terms of population", "26:54", "it's not as bad as you might think if", "26:56", "you stopped aging today and everybody", "26:59", "just went on forever the population", "27:03", "growth rate would be less than the rate", "27:05", "of immigration now that's not I can't go", "27:09", "on forever of course but what we find is", "27:11", "as people healthier especially in", "27:14", "developing nations they have fewer kids", "27:16", "so the calculation shows that it would", "27:18", "eventually taper off so human population", "27:20", "will taper off about nine to ten billion", "27:22", "people and then stay there and that", "27:24", "population will be the happiest", "27:25", "healthiest people in the world know why", "27:27", "they predict that because I was having", "27:30", "this conversation with someone the other", "27:31", "day that as people become more affluent", "27:33", "and society becomes more urban people", "27:38", "will have less and less children and the", "27:40", "population will stabilize is that the", "27:42", "theory behind this right well actually", "27:44", "education is a major part of it just", "27:46", "watch yeah women's education is the main", "27:48", "thing but also just being healthy or", "27:51", "lifts the the wealth of a nation and by", "27:55", "women's education do you mean extended", "27:57", "education so that they pursue careers is", "28:00", "that the idea or is it I mean obviously", "28:03", "most people understand how babies are", "28:05", "made like where where's the education", "28:07", "contributing to a lower population well", "28:10", "so my understanding is that the first", "28:12", "thing you do if you if you educate young", "28:14", "women is that they can make choices for", "28:15", "themselves and they're not just", "28:16", "subjugated you know most men would like", "28:20", "to have more so right so you're thinking", "28:22", "of like third world and write the real", "28:24", "developing world but that's where the", "28:26", "population is a real problem in Europe", "28:27", "they actually are struggling to keep up", "28:29", "with their population you know what", "28:31", "they've got a an ageing tsunami so to", "28:33", "speak same with Japan the average farmer", "28:35", "in Japan is 65 years old they got a real", "28:37", "problem", "28:38", "China's about to head that way too and", "28:40", "that's gonna drag the economy of the", "28:41", "planet down and it's commit a real", "28:43", "problem we gonna waste so much money on", "28:45", "keeping older people alive for

"29:11", "an interesting way of looking at it what", "29:13", "populations as a whole you know when you", "29:16", "look at the world what where are the", "29:19", "people living the longest and why well", "29:22", "it's debatable there are these blue", "29:24", "zones I think many of your listeners", "29:26", "will have heard about those but there", "29:28", "are pockets that have great genes but", "29:32", "they also have great diets and", "29:33", "lifestyles and so the the best one that", "29:35", "I'm familiar with is the island of", "29:37", "Okinawa in Japan and and by the way I", "29:41", "used to follow the Okinawa diet a couple", "29:43", "of my good friends wrote a book about it", "29:45", "so I was on tofu and some fish felt", "29:48", "really great couldn't keep it up but", "29:49", "those one can you keep it up I had kids", "29:52", "and our meals turned into pizzas and", "29:54", "hosta yeah unfortunately but I'm getting", "29:57", "back there now that my kids are", "29:58", "teenagers but the Okinawans they live", "30:02", "into their hundreds fairly frequently", "30:05", "it's not one in a million it's it's more", "30:07", "like one and I think a hundred thousand", "30:09", "or something so it's ten times higher", "30:10", "they they work most of their lives", "30:13", "they're physically active they fast a", "30:15", "lot and they have a lot of green leafy", "30:17", "vegetables and that seems to be the", "30:19", "secret and there's a there were they", "30:22", "were selling something was something", "30:25", "about their mineral rich diet they", "30:27", "remember they were selling it was like a", "30:28", "big thing for awhile coral calcium and", "30:31", "they were using that as an example of", "30:33", "why the Okinawans we're living so long", "30:35", "do you remember that I do remember ad", "30:37", "yeah but in scientific circles we", "30:40", "weren't really bothered with it", "30:41", "yeah like there's calcium is calcium", "30:44", "right yeah I didn't I don't know about", "30:46", "it better calcium from coral or", "30:48", "something I might even be wrong about", "30:50", "that but I just remember reading about", "30:53", "the Okinawan sand that the speculation", "30:56", "they seaweed as well right", "30:58", "very healthy probably the best thing", "31:00", "that they do is they don't overeat mmm", "31:03", "stop at seventy percent", "31:05", "yeah I'm a glutton that's my number one", "31:08", "problem I just love to eat yeah yeah me", "31:11", "too I keep going once I'm in it I just", "31:14", "want to just keep shoving it in my face", "31:16", "but I've done a good job over the last", "31:17", "few years of tapering that off and the", "31:19", "intermittent fast and I think is", "31:21", "probably one of the best things I've", "31:22", "ever done in terms of you know just", "31:24", "maintaining energy levels maintaining", "31:26", "body weight that kind of stuff yeah", "31:29", "yeah you look good so I think that", "31:31", "that's one of the best things that", "31:32", "people can do what we've known for", "31:35", "seventy or more years actually is if you", "31:37", "calorie restrict animals actually even", "31:40", "heat cells and ones they live longer and", "31:41", "this is the most robust way to to", "31:44", "prevent cancer heart disease Alzheimer's", "31:46", "in a mouse and so the intermittent", "31:49", "fasting is just a way of mimicking this", "31:52", "calorie restricted diet so what what is", "31:54", "calorie restriction it's reducing what", "31:56", "you would your doctor would recommend", "31:57", "for your body but reducing it back to", "31:59", "about twenty to thirty percent so it's", "32:01", "quite extreme that's not pleasant I", "32:03", "tried that for a week gave up too hard", "32:05", "but intermittent fasting like yourself", "32:07", "it's doable it's not always pleasant but", "32:09", "I think that's the best way to do it and", "32:12", "with the mice it works just as well as", "32:15", "calorie restriction which is pretty much", "32:16", "always being a bit hungry now one of the", "32:19", "things are you looking at in terms of", "32:21", "mitigating stress or like what other", "32:24", "factors are there that you have to keep", "32:26", "an eye on yeah stress is a bad one I try", "32:30", "to take life in my stride not get too", "32:34", "worried about it remember what's", "32:35", "important so my heart rate rarely goes", "32:38", "up even under a really extreme", "32:41", "circumstances and that that's about it I", "32:44", "try to balance my life as best I can I", "32:47", "don't go through airport scanners as", "32:49", "much as I can and have x-rays these", "32:51", "little things do you think those are bad",

through the", "33:19", "scanner and they got quite upset because", "33:21", "it's a bother but they said you know", "33:24", "it's just as much damage to your body as", "33:26", "the flight and so I said why do I want", "33:28", "to double it anyway so I go through", "33:31", "scanners but I try not to but let me", "33:33", "tell you why I think it's so bad because", "33:36", "scanners are going to change what we", "33:40", "call the epigenome now a lot of people", "33:43", "haven't heard of the epigenome the", "33:45", "genome everybody knows it's your DNA the", "33:49", "code of life the epigenome is what", "33:52", "regulates and reads those genes at the", "33:54", "right time okay and so we've we knew", "33:57", "about DNA we know how to read the genome", "33:58", "pretty easily we can do that now on a", "34:00", "mars bar sized device in a day the", "34:04", "epigenome is quite difficult different", "34:05", "the epigenome is that the structure of", "34:08", "how the DNA is

is not that you're losing", "34:19", "the DNA structure", "34:20", "you're not having mutations you're", "34:22", "actually changing the epigenome which is", "34:25", "the the reader of the genes so

digital", "34:37", "information of course and the reason we", "34:39", "switch to digital in the first place is", "34:40", "that it's very copyable and it doesn't", "34:43", "wear out or as a cassette tape you know", "34:46", "people our age know that if you try to", "34:48", "copy that a thousand times there's not", "34:50", "much left at the end so the the compact", "34:53", "disc information is the genome the", "34:56", "epigenome is the reader of the CD that", "34:58", "little laser that goes around and what I", "35:01", "think is causing aging is not the loss", "35:03", "of the digital information but it's the", "35:05", "reader at the analog part and that's", "35:08", "like a cassette tape that eventually", "35:10", "runs out what we what's going on really", "35:13", "is that your cells are losing the", "35:15", "ability to read the right genes the way", "35:17", "they did when you were 20 and that's", "35:20", "basically", "35:21", "noise informational noise that gathers", "35:23", "over time and so what we end up with", "35:26", "when we're 80 is a compact disc or DVD", "35:29", "that's scratched so the reader cannot", "35:31", "read the right genes or", "35:32", "time and the cells become dysfunctional", "35:34", "now what we're working on is how do you", "35:36", "polish that CD or that DVD to get that", "35:39", "information back again and if you can do", "35:41", "that I think that's really the best way", "35:43", "to reset your age and I we haven't", "35:47", "published it yet but we're working on", "35:49", "ways to actually reset that genome and", "35:52", "actually get back the information that", "35:54", "we once had when we were 20 so what is", "35:56", "happening to the epigenome when you're", "35:58", "going through those scanners well so", "36:00", "what we found is the biggest trap door", "36:02", "of the epigenome is a a broken", "36:04", "chromosome DNA break and I don't know", "36:07", "about scanners that's just a abundance", "36:09", "of caution but an x-ray will damage your", "36:11", "DNA no question even going out in the", "36:15", "Sun will do a bit of that and we think", "36:17", "that the cells reaction to that

I grew up in", "37:04", "the stratum son and I can tell you that", "37:07", "you know most Australians look older", "37:09", "than they should know Lausanne no ozone", "37:13", "and lack of sunscreen in the 1970s why", "37:15", "do you guys have a whole Nils on over", "37:17", "Australia what's all about what you do", "37:19", "know it's what what did the world -", "37:21", "chlorophyll oh sure", "37:24", "well hairspray why does it accumulate", "37:27", "over Australia's or it started in", "37:30", "Antarctica and so ozone will i've been", "37:33", "convenient nobody's up there leave it up", "37:35", "there yeah well if we need to please", "37:36", "leave it below it that way yeah well", "37:39", "yeah that the the ozone layer is fairly", "37:43", "important if you don't want to get", "37:44", "singed by UV light", "37:46", "yeah well that's one of the first things", "37:47", "I noticed when I went to Australia was", "37:49", "there's all these Sun cancer warnings", "37:52", "skin cancer warnings everywhere", "37:54", "well a third of Australians get some", "37:56", "form of kiss skin cancers that's crazy", "37:58", "yeah but what's also gonna happen is", "38:00", "it'll disrupt your epigenome over time", "38:01", "and you'll look old but if you have an", "38:04", "x-ray you're gonna damage your organs", "38:05", "you're gonna accelerate aging I believe", "38:07", "in

the cell and make a", "38:26", "cell not just believe that it's 20 again", "38:29", "but actually be 20 mmm so what do you do", "38:31", "we reprogram them there are a set of", "38:34", "genes that we we and others have found", "38:36", "three main ones that when you put them", "38:39", "into a cell or even into a mouse they", "38:43", "become younger again whoa how far do you", "38:47", "think you are from implementing this on", "38:49", "human beings well so theoretically you", "38:52", "do it to yourself you could you could do", "38:54", "it to yourself", "38:55", "theoretically I would I wouldn't do that", "38:56", "cuz I'm not crazy we need to figure out", "38:59", "the safety I don't want to become a", "39:00", "giant tumor well we just use it on bad", "39:03", "people uh yeah well I think people know", "39:06", "to throw tournament ooh 18 year olds and", "39:08", "go whoa yeah well yeah that that would", "39:12", "be for someone else someone else well", "39:15", "hopefully no one would ever do that why", "39:16", "not", "39:17", "well what kill them is what we're doing", "39:19", "I agree with you that we want it we want", "39:21", "to see what happens in your hands you", "39:23", "just give them like free pizza or", "39:26", "something they're on death row right if", "39:29", "you're there already murderers you want", "39:30", "to be the first one to me come on my", "39:32", "live death row and I want to go on to", "39:34", "death row but I'm saying if you're gonna", "39:35", "kill somebody like wouldn't be a good", "39:37", "idea to like oh hey we'll give you four", "39:40", "hours of TV a day so we want to shoot", "39:44", "you up with some stuff it's gonna make", "39:45", "you younger if I was on death row I'd go", "39:47", "do it", "39:48", "see what's up I don't watch TV well what", "39:51", "we do is uh so we give it to old mice", "39:55", "and we check it what happens to their", "39:57", "body so nursery", "39:58", "people do it to them right well tell you", "40:01", "what I wouldn't force anyone but if", "40:03", "somebody was blind or almost blind yeah", "40:06", "and he now studies we're recovering", "40:09", "eyesight really yeah", "40:11", "what about two damaged eyes yeah really", "40:13", "yeah so I don't want to freak out", "40:15", "because I know a guy who's got a", "40:17", "significantly damaged eye from fighting", "40:20", "well I can tell you what we've done and", "40:23", "this is what we're riding up for", "40:24", "publication now we've done a few things", "40:27", "three things to the mice one is we've", "40:29", "pinched their optic nerve and crushed it", "40:31", "which was a test for growing neurons in", "40:35", "AI and we find it with our reprogramming", "40:37", "we can make the nerves be just like a", "40:39", "newborn baby", "40:40", "they grow back and then we also tested", "40:44", "on glaucoma pressure in the eye we", "40:45", "increased pressure in the mouse's eye", "40:47", "and they lose their large litre eyesight", "40:50", "and we can recover that and then we also", "40:52", "a test old mice that don't see very well", "40:53", "and we also seem to improve their", "40:55", "eyesight almost back to normal", "40:57", "so what I I don't think we'll be going", "40:59", "to nursing homes anytime soon but what", "41:01", "we are doing is running a clinical trial", "41:03", "on this and so we're looking to do that", "41:05", "in early 2020 and the clinical trial", "41:08", "will be on people with glaucoma or", "41:09", "various eye issues the plan is glaucoma", "41:13", "first but it could work for other", "41:15", "damaged retinas as well even broken", "41:18", "spinal cords what we're thinking of", "41:19", "trying Wow and that's just one part of", "41:22", "the body imagine what it could", "41:24", "potentially do to the rest of us do you", "41:26", "feel incredibly fortunate to be living", "41:28", "in this century I do every day but I", "41:31", "would love to live next century because", "41:33", "it's gonna yeah but your what's cool is", "41:36", "you're kind of at the tip of the spear", "41:39", "pushing this stuff right now like you", "41:41", "you're gonna be one of the guys that", "41:43", "gets to see the stuff get implemented", "41:44", "from your actual own research where it", "41:48", "didn't exist before", "41:49", "yeah that's pretty damn cool better than", "41:51", "like living 100 years from now where you", "41:53", "just take it for granted like a trust", "41:55", "fund kid you know yeah but just imagine", "41:58", "what you can do in a hundred years you", "42:00", "can write well maybe you'll be here", "42:02", "we're all on the yeah you might be 150", "42:06", "we'll see yeah I think there's a chance", "42:08", "someone will be well it's it's a good", "42:11", "chance you're gonna be", "42:12", "I mean you're the one who's gonna know", "42:14", "well so he's my philosophy I'm not gonna", "42:16", "let anyone try technology until I've", "42:18", "tried it first really so I was taking an", "42:24", "Iranian pause because you're you're", "42:26", "currently doing something like that I'm", "42:28", "not doing the three programming yet", "42:29", "that's a little dangerous but the others", "42:31", "I've always wanted to know first", "42:33", "my eyesight is starting to go cuz I'm 51", "42:35", "now and like when I'm like if I had to", "42:38", "read this book I got a NIC Christakis", "42:41", "this book if I'm sitting here reading", "42:42", "this book if I don't have reading", "42:44", "glasses on I got to do this it's a bit", "42:46", "of a struggle gonna be able to fix that", "42:49", "so potentially in the mice we can you", "42:52", "can we well I don't we don't give them", "42:54", "books to read but their eyesight", "42:55", "improves we can test that how do you do", "42:57", "it there's a moving screen no I don't", "43:00", "mean how do you oh how do you know how", "43:02", "do you test or not not how you test", "43:04", "rather how do you improve their eyesight", "43:06", "we've we put these reprogramming genes", "43:08", "into a virus which is already used to", "43:11", "treat genetic diseases in the eye and we", "43:13", "inject it straight into the mouse's", "43:15", "eyeball this sounds like the beginning", "43:17", "of a horror movie", "43:18", "yeah I think it's actually or an awesome", "43:22", "movie it's the awesome part that I'm so", "43:24", "pissed on well if you're going blind", "43:25", "right one injection from your doctor and", "43:27", "then you take an antibiotic to turn the", "43:29", "genes on for as long as you need and you", "43:32", "get your eyesight back that's not", "43:33", "horrific at all that's a pretty", "43:34", "incredible how far away do you think you", "43:36", "are doing that to humans", "43:37", "well 2020 will be the first safety study", "43:41", "we hope yeah but the crazy stuff the", "43:45", "future is if this all goes well you have", "43:48", "an injection in your vein let's say when", "43:49", "you're 30 and then those viruses infect", "43:52", "your body and they sit there dormant", "43:54", "until you need them so when might you", "43:56", "need them you might have a car accident", "43:57", "turn them on you can turn them on with", "44:00", "just a an antibiotic in a drip or in a", "44:03", "pill or you start to lose your eyesight", "44:04", "take it take an antibiotic so you put", "44:08", "them in your body almost as an insurance", "44:10", "policy and then you have the option to", "44:12", "turn them on in the future", "44:13", "exactly Wow it's what we do in the mice", "44:16", "now with every action we assume there's", "44:21", "some", "44:23", "negative consequence or potentially", "44:26", "negative consequence right we always", "44:29", "assume that but it's not always right", "44:31", "mm-hmm so it with the molecules that", "44:34", "we've been testing for years now like in", "44:35", "oh man we haven't seen any downside just", "44:37", "longer endurance and protection so there", "44:39", "isn't always a downside to these things", "44:41", "in fact if you just think n MN is", "44:43", "replacing a molecule that we lose over", "44:45", "time as we get older it's just becoming", "44:47", "you know it's a fairly natural process", "44:49", "no downside exercising and dieting", "44:51", "either right of course and you said you", "44:54", "run once a week is that what you you and", "44:57", "you do do you lift weights as well right", "44:59", "and when you do it do try to not go too", "45:03", "hard and burn yourself out too much do", "45:07", "you have a sweet spot yeah I do I do I", "45:11", "try not to go too much all right that", "45:13", "that's the trick with everything in life", "45:15", "mm-hmm it's this so hormesis effect to", "45:18", "get your body damaged enough that it can", "45:21", "repair itself but give you the benefits", "45:22", "without like having a lot of x-rays or", "45:26", "radiation we're out doing it and", "45:28", "scratching that CD yeah that's always my", "45:31", "thought on people that do extreme", "45:34", "endurance activities like ultra", "45:37", "marathons and things on those lines I", "45:39", "mean I marvel at their willpower and", "45:43", "their ability to push themselves through", "45:44", "that and the the physical condition they", "45:47", "have to be in to perform such feats but", "45:49", "I always think man you're probably doing", "45:52", "x times the amount of damage to your", "45:55", "body that a normal person does at your", "45:57", "age it sounds right calorie restriction", "46:00", "works but if you overdo it you also", "46:01", "starve you yeah you die so you got to", "46:04", "find the right balance right how do you", "46:06", "how do you know what the right balance", "46:08", "is for you good question how does", "46:11", "anybody so we live in an age that is", "46:13", "still fairly primitive this is why I", "46:14", "like the future these days we go to the", "46:17", "doctor most of us go to the doctor for", "46:19", "annual physical which is ludicrous the", "46:22", "idea that your doctor will take a", "46:24", "hopefully a blood test or prostate exam", "46:27", "once a year that's kind of crazy what", "46:29", "happens if you've got a tumor that", "46:30", "developed the day you leave the doctor's", "46:32", "office so the future and actually", "46:34", "partially for those who are on the", "46:36", "cutting edge", "46:36", "can be done right now it's monitoring", "46:40", "your body in various ways genetically", "46:43", "epigenetically we can measure those", "46:45", "scratches right now and also with blood", "46:48", "tests you can also have companies tell", "46:50", "you if you're out of range if you're not", "46:54", "optimized and how to get it back in", "46:55", "order so that's what I do so how often", "46:58", "do you monitor your blood probably every", "47:00", "few months I have a blood test from a", "47:03", "company that tells me what I need to", "47:05", "correct and how extensive it is is this", "47:08", "blood test like is it a standard one", "47:09", "that a normal person can get or do you", "47:11", "have to have a prescription to get this", "47:12", "or no you can go online and get it it's", "47:15", "about I think forty parameters they", "47:17", "measure some that are not standard that", "47:18", "your doctor wouldn't do some are pretty", "47:20", "standard but what's nice is it's it's a", "47:22", "tracking system it's called insight", "47:24", "tracker and they you can see over time", "47:26", "if things are going up and even if", "47:27", "they're not out of range yet you can see", "47:29", "if they headed that direction and", "47:30", "correct it before it's too late", "47:31", "so that's why one of the reasons I'm on", "47:34", "metformin my blood glucose was going up", "47:35", "and up and up which predicts lower life", "47:38", "and some metformin got it back down to", "47:41", "where it was optimal again so that's one", "47:43", "of the things in metformin does is it", "47:44", "lowers your blood glucose that's what", "47:46", "it's prescribed for for diabetics mmm", "47:48", "now does that have any effect on your", "47:50", "energy levels I don't think so I haven't", "47:53", "noticed that hmm where you would notice", "47:58", "it is during rigorous exercise that", "48:00", "makes sense do you feel it uh well so I", "48:04", "take med Forman at night so that maybe", "48:07", "probably the best thing right so when", "48:09", "you're sleeping it's having its effect", "48:11", "and it's run its course by the time you", "48:12", "wake up you play yeah hmm now when you", "48:16", "you are exercising are you exercising", "48:18", "fasted or do you take certain amount of", "48:20", "carbohydrates before you do any kind of", "48:22", "physical exercise so I start the gym to", "48:25", "2 p.m. on a Sunday and I'll have a salad", "48:28", "wrap or something like that so I'm not", "48:31", "feeling hungry during it and one pass", "48:33", "out huh and so I understand you're", "48:38", "getting these blood tests but do you", "48:40", "have a trainer do you do set a workout", "48:43", "or you structure it I do now just", "48:46", "recently go to trainer", "48:49", "it's great thing to do with your son", "48:51", "father sometime so yeah that we have an", "48:54", "hour of trainer and then we we also do a", "48:56", "bit of boxing and the mix it up you're", "48:59", "beating your song up yeah it's fun it's", "49:01", "legal I think go to the sauna and that's", "49:05", "just the best way to spend a day that is", "49:07", "a nice way to spend day so how many days", "49:11", "a week you doing this so you do give", "49:12", "yourself days off do you you schedule", "49:15", "that well it so once a day of that I", "49:17", "once a week on Sunday enjoying the week", "49:19", "if I have a chance and I'm not traveling", "49:21", "I go to the home gym and when you say", "49:24", "you run once a week is that by design", "49:26", "that you only give yourself once a week", "49:27", "I probably run two times a week a high", "49:30", "intensity if I could and I try to do", "49:34", "that often I'm on a plane or hmm right", "49:37", "and we say high intensity are you", "49:38", "sprinting doing track work like what", "49:41", "kind of stuff yeah so I'm not an expert", "49:43", "so what I do is I I will enter hop spend", "49:47", "a half an hour on one of those", "49:48", "treadmills that you shaped mm-hmm yeah", "49:51", "yeah great they are so that you", "49:53", "determine your speed so I'll sprint and", "49:55", "then I'll slow down and sprint slow down", "49:56", "they're actually more difficult than", "49:58", "running on the flat surface", "50:00", "it's where regular treadmills is", "50:02", "actually easier than running because the", "50:04", "treadmill is moving you just kind of", "50:05", "lifting your legs up and keeping moving", "50:07", "with this actually you're powering it so", "50:10", "by you pushing on it it's actually more", "50:13", "it's like running I forget what the", "50:15", "degree incline is but it's like an X X", "50:17", "amount per centage harder than a regular", "50:19", "run oh good well that's what feels good", "50:22", "to me and what although it's a little", "50:24", "bit scary if you're not used to these", "50:25", "treadmills you can run off the front", "50:27", "because they're free-flowing go it right", "50:29", "off the tip they have handles oh yeah", "50:33", "you're a genius you're not gonna go", "50:34", "flying off the treadmill again dummy I'm", "50:36", "no genius especially when it comes to", "50:38", "sport well yeah yeah I'm a big fan of", "50:42", "those things and it's nice too because", "50:45", "there's a lot of give to them there's", "50:46", "not much pounding when you run on those", "50:48", "it's not like running on hard surface", "50:51", "yeah so I tried to go easy on my joints", "50:52", "I've seen you've probably all seen", "50:54", "sports players with all sorts of damage", "50:57", "to joints and I've done all of it you", "51:00", "know", "51:00", "yeah so yet low-impact high intensity", "51:03", "hmm and as far as weight lifting what", "51:07", "kind of stuff you do in there cuz weight", "51:08", "lifting does have a beneficial effect on", "51:10", "bone density and it's supposedly has an", "51:14", "effect on anti-aging as well yeah", "51:16", "absolutely believe in that and so I try", "51:19", "to maintain some muscle mass it's good", "51:22", "for burning fat too so you know I try to", "51:25", "do not go overboard with the bench", "51:27", "presses otherwise I'll have even more", "51:29", "rounded shoulders estrella get the", "51:31", "straight back so the trainer is helping", "51:33", "me bring my body back

metformin the NMM and what", "68:39", "else is he taking he's also on a statin", "68:42", "and he exercises that's the main so he's", "68:44", "on a statin as well because he has the", "68:45", "same predisposed condition you know", "68:47", "right that's an awful condition man that", "68:50", "mean one of the things that I was talked", "68:51", "to my doctor about he's saying that that", "68:54", "there are people that just have high", "68:57", "blood pressure or higher you know higher", "68:59", "blood pressure or higher instances of", "69:01", "heart disease in their family and it's", "69:03", "just a really unfortunate genetic issue", "69:06", "it is it is but fortunately we were able", "69:09", "to tackle heart disease pretty well", "69:11", "yeah these days with blood pressure", "69:13", "drugs and cholesterol drugs you know", "69:15", "there were some side effects no question", "69:16", "but what we're talking about with these", "69:18", "longevity drugs that are in development", "69:20", "is that sure you can be prescribed this", "69:22", "medicine for your Alzheimer's or if your", "69:24", "liver disease but as a side effect it'll", "69:26", "keep the rest of your body healthy as", "69:28", "well protect you against cancer and all", "69:30", "these other things", "69:31", "that's what's so radical about what", "69:32", "we're doing hmm now what about CRISPR", "69:38", "and what do you think is going to come", "69:41", "out of that in terms of like real-world", "69:43", "application for an adult I mean what if", "69:47", "people don't know what Chris Perez", "69:48", "please explain it in layman's terms", "69:51", "yeah so CRISPR is a term actually was", "69:54", "invented in my department partly so I", "69:56", "know it pretty well it's back bacteria", "69:59", "have an immune system that cuts invaders", "70:01", "because their DNA and what we've done", "70:04", "now as scientists we've now utilized", "70:06", "that system take it out back to you and", "70:09", "we use it to create designer mutations", "70:13", "designer gene changes in animals and", "70:16", "also in humans so it's a bacterial", "70:19", "immune system that corrects genes and we", "70:21", "use it all time now it's um it's it's", "70:24", "actually what's interesting about being", "70:25", "able to mutate genes for many years but", "70:27", "this is dial up a gene mutation you can", "70:30", "choose exactly where you want to make it", "70:31", "and so I think many of you Lister's will", "70:34", "know that recently late last year", "70:37", "Chinese researcher in our field came out", "70:40", "and said he's engineered a couple of", "70:42", "twin girls with CRISPR to be resistant", "70:44", "to HIV the AIDS virus Wow um if they're", "70:49", "telling you that you got to think", "70:51", "they're doing some stuff they're not", "70:52", "telling you about right well yet have", "70:55", "some", "70:55", "with giant heads and well it's coming", "70:58", "through walls", "70:58", "yeah and well yeah if you start to see", "71:01", "people that are 90 and and they're still", "71:05", "as young as 20 you know something's", "71:07", "going on yeah that's the weird one right", "71:09", "if you can you go hey what are you doing", "71:13", "nothing", "71:13", "just eating healthy looking good take", "71:15", "care of box all right we're not gonna", "71:17", "tell you yeah yeah well so consider this", "71:19", "that that so the chance of getting HIV", "71:20", "in China is one in a thousand", "71:22", "so that doctor was seemingly he thought", "71:26", "he was ethical protecting the babies", "71:27", "from something that's I would say really", "71:30", "rare right whereas if you really wanted", "71:32", "to do something helpful to those kids", "71:34", "and we agreed it was it was something", "71:36", "you should do why not make them", "71:38", "resistant to heart disease or to cancer", "71:40", "right we can do that it was weird that", "71:42", "he chose HIV is the first test why do", "71:44", "you think they did that", "71:45", "um I think because that it was a very", "71:48", "well understood mutation that would if", "71:51", "you just destroyed the gene it would", "71:53", "work or as with these other diseases you", "71:55", "have to be much more precise but the", "71:57", "reason that we scientists got really", "71:59", "upset was that he did it in secrecy and", "72:01", "then just launched it on the world and", "72:04", "that kind of thing because that it's a", "72:06", "fine line in ethics you want to be doing", "72:08", "that with total transparency I mean I", "72:11", "think he was hoping to become win a", "72:14", "Nobel Prize or be a star and it", "72:17", "backfired on him because he just did it", "72:19", "in secrecy it backfired in the", "72:22", "scientific community absolutely in the", "72:24", "in the real world in the media I was", "72:26", "shocked how little discussion there was", "72:28", "if this news came out in the 2000s", "72:30", "during the Bush era", "72:31", "it would have been panels investigations", "72:33", "that would have been in news for months", "72:35", "but it wasn't people went what's next on", "72:38", "Twitter do you think it's just because", "72:39", "the news cycles so insane I do yeah when", "72:44", "you have a scientific experiment of that", "72:48", "nature what's the standard protocol for", "72:51", "a scientist whether it is or is it the", "72:53", "same in China and in Russia and the", "72:55", "United States as a scientific community", "72:56", "almost operate under different like a", "73:01", "different set of rules and anything else", "73:05", "you mean between countries yes I mean", "73:07", "you know like", "73:09", "obviously technologies not shared like", "73:11", "China is doing something technologically", "73:14", "the United States is they we have to", "73:17", "speculate we have to figure it out but", "73:18", "when it comes to medical science", "73:20", "right is it sort of an open book because", "73:23", "everybody sharing information I know or", "73:25", "at least alerting everyone to what", "73:28", "they're working on well I know you're", "73:30", "going with this at least I think I do", "73:33", "yeah", "73:33", "yes I I advise governments around the", "73:36", "world about what's going on under the", "73:38", "radar is my best I know and there are", "73:40", "countries I'm not gonna name them that", "73:42", "are doing research under the radar and", "73:44", "are preventing people like myself from", "73:48", "entering those buildings to have a look", "73:49", "what's going on yeah so I'm sure that", "73:53", "what's going on in there is actually a", "73:56", "little bit broader you know we hear", "73:59", "about but I don't know how long is it", "74:01", "before just say Russia no I didn't say", "74:03", "Russia I didn't say anything no country", "74:05", "I want to be able to travel I really a", "74:07", "Russia but I said it but in in in", "74:13", "countries where there are different", "74:15", "standards what's stopping them others", "74:18", "who wants to prevent their child from", "74:19", "having heart disease which could kill", "74:21", "their child you know 40% chance versus", "74:24", "one in a thousand and eventually you", "74:26", "could make a child that could live 200", "74:28", "years once we know how to do it that", "74:30", "could be the future there's always a", "74:34", "concern that someone is doing something", "74:37", "that is beneficial in one way but", "74:40", "negative in another way and if everyone", "74:42", "doesn't get to examine the research it's", "74:46", "very difficult like if we wanted in the", "74:48", "United States wanted to do something", "74:50", "similar to what they're doing over there", "74:52", "we would want to have access to what", "74:54", "they've learned right we would and so", "74:57", "generally scientists share information", "74:59", "right but there are companies that are", "75:01", "government-owned that are very secret", "75:03", "right or even private organizations and", "75:07", "that's where it's a little tricky and", "75:09", "that's why we we scientists get really", "75:11", "upset when companies or organizations", "75:13", "don't share information especially on", "75:16", "something that's critical right and", "75:17", "what's not really stated but it's my", "75:20", "belief is that one of the reasons there", "75:21", "was such a backlash", "75:22", "this crisper design a baby experiment", "75:25", "and it really was an experiment it's not", "75:28", "just that it was potentially dangerous", "75:29", "and you could end up with kids but have", "75:32", "deformities but also that unless we do", "75:35", "this in a in a measured manner under", "75:39", "supervision there's there could be a", "75:41", "backlash like there was against", "75:43", "stem-cell research you know in the 2000s", "75:45", "we don't want that again we want to be", "75:47", "able to do this the right way this time", "75:48", "right is it particularly if something", "75:50", "goes wrong with those children", "75:52", "one person could ruin it for millions of", "75:55", "right if they jumped the gun and yeah so", "75:57", "this we're on the second generation of", "75:59", "crispers are correct in terms of the", "76:03", "editing tools they've become more they", "76:06", "have that there's there's surprisingly", "76:08", "that there's a lot of different bacteria", "76:10", "that have these systems so we're getting", "76:13", "new ones all the time some that are more", "76:15", "accurate because you don't want what we", "76:17", "call off target effect you don't want to", "76:19", "accidentally mutate some gene that's", "76:21", "required for head development and so", "76:24", "yeah well I think in my department we're", "76:26", "on fourth generation fourth generation", "76:28", "yeah Wow yeah see I'm just going by", "76:31", "Radiolab podcasts yeah so my departments", "76:35", "a fun fun department to be in imagine", "76:37", "they are in the ending all sorts of", "76:38", "stuff what did you ever see the", "76:41", "documentary Icarus oh yeah rings a bell", "76:45", "it's Brian Fogle's documentary on the", "76:48", "Russian doping program state-sponsored", "76:51", "doping program and Sochi the Sochi", "76:54", "Olympics and how they this incredibly", "76:58", "complicated system of stealing the urine", "77:01", "and putting it through a hole in the", "77:02", "wall and putting fake your and back", "77:04", "through it was really really amazing", "77:05", "amazing amazing documentary but details", "77:09", "this incredibly complicated", "77:13", "state-sponsored doping system I would", "77:16", "imagine that with something like CRISPR", "77:19", "or some various new forms of genetic", "77:23", "editing that that's one of the things", "77:26", "that they're going to be looking into", "77:27", "that they're going to be looking into", "77:30", "things that are going to enhance", "77:31", "athletic performance yeah you might need", "77:34", "to have a DNA test to see if you've put", "77:36", "one of these viruses in your right why", "77:39", "you 50 and now you're running like a 20", "77:40", "year old right so that's all possible", "77:43", "you know that the I also write reports", "77:46", "for for governments and one of the", "77:47", "things that I predicted 15 within the", "77:50", "next 15 years was CRISPR being used to", "77:53", "engineer the human genome and make a", "77:55", "baby I didn't realize it was gonna", "77:56", "happen within one year well a lot of", "77:58", "these technologies that I'm trying to", "78:01", "predict happen way faster than even I", "78:03", "think it gonna happen do you think it's", "78:05", "possibly happened in other circumstances", "78:07", "that they're not going public with it's", "78:12", "always possible there may be some human", "78:15", "clones running around right now that we", "78:16", "don't know about do you think so it's", "78:19", "certainly doable scientifically there", "78:20", "might be some rogue nation who's doing", "78:21", "it", "78:22", "barbra streisand's talks or we're pretty", "78:24", "easy to clone yeah she had her dogs", "78:27", "cloned right yeah yeah Sammy the", "78:30", "fourteen-year-old dog is now there's two", "78:32", "of them oh Jesus Christ it that is so", "78:35", "weird that because I'd be so scared I'd", "78:37", "go to sleep and wake up that thing would", "78:38", "be hovering over my face with red", "78:41", "glowing eyes yeah wait till you have", "78:43", "design a cemetery what what a friend of", "78:46", "mine comes put some on Tate Stanford", "78:47", "we're entertaining the idea of making", "78:49", "dogs live longer genetically so why", "78:53", "would you want your family member to", "78:54", "only live yeah 12 years I think about", "78:57", "that man my dog is only 2 and he's such", "78:59", "a sweetie", "78:59", "you know I'm sad that one day I mean I", "79:02", "had to put my other dog down recently", "79:03", "and who's 13 and just really who's a", "79:08", "mastiff too and he was struggling and I", "79:10", "just think man this two-year-old one day", "79:12", "he's gonna be in that same sort of", "79:13", "situation well it is and so we have", "79:15", "three dogs my wife runs a therapy dog", "79:17", "okay Barbra Streisand had a beloved dog", "79:19", "Samantha cloned that crazy bitch look at", "79:22", "her", "79:22", "two copies of one dog Jesus Christ", "79:25", "that's so strange how about just get a", "79:27", "new dog you fucking nut well so it some", "79:31", "we might be nuts in my household because", "79:33", "we're giving out dogs in a man oh and", "79:36", "how's it doing how old's the dog so good", "79:39", "what the oldest dog is nine and he's", "79:40", "still doing fine Oh does he look", "79:42", "different", "79:43", "uh my wife says so these are anecdotes", "79:45", "I'm not gonna publish them but", "79:47", "so Alice's a therapy dog and he has to", "79:50", "go to hospitals and nursing homes and if", "79:52", "he has any men according to my wife he", "79:55", "can't be a therapy dog because he's too", "79:56", "excited he's running around jumping", "79:58", "around really so that that's anecdotal", "80:00", "but that seems to fit with what others", "80:03", "have experienced too", "80:04", "Wow yes we're hoping to have some", "80:09", "treatments for some pets shortly one of", "80:11", "the companies that I'm working with", "80:13", "treatments for pets yeah well you got to", "80:15", "think hey man dogs going to live 13", "80:17", "years anyway you know well yeah and also", "80:20", "we have a dog that has a kidney defect", "80:23", "and the vet says it's only gonna live", "80:24", "five years so she's three now so that's", "80:27", "the one you're experimenting on well we", "80:29", "experiment on on it on all of them but", "80:31", "um but what's the downside that's gotta", "80:35", "be so uncomfortable for some people", "80:37", "listen just right now I don't know how", "80:39", "to feel about that right what is the", "80:40", "downside if your dog has got a kidney", "80:42", "defect and it's only gonna probably live", "80:44", "to be nine meanwhile that dogs gonna", "80:46", "live to be a thousand years old well", "80:48", "let's say I'll come back like you know", "80:50", "be in the lotus position meditating 100", "80:53", "years from now what do you do if it", "80:54", "starts talking to you that'd be great", "80:57", "yeah what what do you do if you turn a", "81:02", "dog into some new kind of thing that", "81:04", "lives thirty or forty years what do you", "81:06", "tell people like if your dog like right", "81:09", "now you're talking about on the podcast", "81:10", "and a bunch of people are probably gonna", "81:12", "remember but a lot of people forget but", "81:14", "if like 15 20 years from now your dogs", "81:17", "still chasing balls and we're gonna come", "81:20", "over your house hey Dave what the fuck's", "81:21", "going on with your dog man right stop", "81:23", "the same dog that's Charlie yeah", "81:24", "how come Charlie doesn't have grey hair", "81:25", "anymore man right well you know people", "81:28", "don't have any gray hair no yeah man", "81:31", "that's weird isn't it you know of any", "81:33", "that's weird right", "81:33", "how long been on this stuff well drove", "81:36", "our trolley started 12 years ago mmm it", "81:39", "Foreman about three years ago and a man", "81:41", "about the same time Wow does anyone in", "81:43", "your family have gray hair is it a", "81:45", "genetic issue", "81:47", "my father has old gray hair my brother's", "81:51", "about 1/3 Cory off grace Wow as your", "81:53", "brother taking the stuff you're taking", "81:54", "only recently uh-huh interesting yeah we", "81:59", "call that an N of", "82:01", "in an experiment which is insufficient", "82:03", "right so I don't want to get slapped on", "82:05", "the wrist by medical schools on society", "82:08", "who's saying all these things you're", "82:10", "just answering questions sir do not", "82:11", "worry", "82:12", "right but so far so good if I'm around", "82:14", "in another 100 years we'll know", "82:15", "something's odd that would be", "82:17", "unbelievably fascinating if your dog", "82:19", "lived to be like 30 or 40 years old that", "82:21", "would be really incredible and if I meet", "82:24", "you in 15 years you still have dark hair", "82:26", "I'll be like what what the hell man what", "82:31", "are the things are you taking do you", "82:33", "take multivitamins I take vitamin D", "82:36", "that's it with k2 just vitamin D yeah", "82:41", "what about E or K or any of those k2 and", "82:45", "D together and that's it Oh hmm so I'm", "82:48", "afraid of iron rate of it yeah why", "82:52", "there's some results that I've seen that", "82:55", "that excess iron especially in the", "82:57", "elderly leads to senescence of cells and", "83:00", "buildup of those zombie cells is a bad", "83:02", "thing and is this dietary iron like from", "83:05", "vegetables or is it from cooking on a", "83:08", "cast-iron pan or well I only know from", "83:12", "correlations so I'm looking at tissue", "83:14", "that's full of iron and the cells are", "83:16", "not looking good so all I can think is I", "83:18", "don't want to overload my cellphone R so", "83:20", "this is like hmm how much iron is too", "83:24", "much iron we don't know yet because I", "83:27", "always hear it especially from women the", "83:29", "iron deficiencies for some reason I hear", "83:32", "I've heard it from several women sure", "83:36", "but for the elderly overloading them", "83:39", "with iron I think is a real problem so", "83:41", "there's a sweet spot to hit well yeah", "83:44", "I'm sure I'm sure there is but the iron", "83:47", "will will damage your cells pretty badly", "83:49", "so you don't want to go overboard mm-hmm", "83:51", "and no other supplements now I try to", "83:55", "eat vegetables which hopefully will", "83:56", "right make sure I'm not deficient in", "83:59", "anything green leafy dark vegetables", "84:03", "exactly exactly that's fresh if I can", "84:06", "colorful straight out of the fridge", "84:08", "instead of going for the four", "84:11", "a piece of cooked meat I'll go for a", "84:13", "carrot or something late so many carrots", "84:16", "I probably turn orange no carrots have a", "84:19", "lot of sugar oh great now got to cut out", "84:22", "my carrots well I mean especially if you", "84:24", "drink them in the juice form like I know", "84:26", "a lot of friends who really enjoy fruit", "84:27", "juices and vegetable juices and I always", "84:30", "say well I mean that vegetable juice", "84:32", "yeah it's probably great but fruit juice", "84:34", "man drinking a big glass orange juice", "84:37", "you might as well be having a coca-cola", "84:38", "yeah", "84:40", "yeah I agree so our household has a ban", "84:43", "on smoothies and fruit juices and so", "84:48", "does that have sugar in them I used to", "84:49", "be able to go to like Jamba Juice and", "84:51", "get one of those big ol smoothies and", "84:53", "feel like you're doing something good", "84:55", "for your body I used to think yeah look", "84:57", "at I got all this blueberries in there", "84:59", "and great stuff but meanwhile there's", "85:01", "just a gang of sugar in that thing yeah", "85:03", "I heard an interesting thing that that", "85:05", "whole milk is actually potentially", "85:07", "better for you than the low-fat oh yeah", "85:09", "you'll use less of it and it doesn't you", "85:11", "know milk has some sugar in it it's also", "85:13", "attached to fat right the whole milk has", "85:15", "fat in it it's normal it's normal for", "85:18", "your body to cross movement that way", "85:19", "right what what I want is I want my", "85:21", "money back from the nutritionists in the", "85:23", "1970s and 80s I", "85:24", "I skipped eggs and Bakey I could have", "85:27", "been eating that stuff well you remember", "85:28", "that food pyramid that used to be in the", "85:30", "dr. Seuss books you're teaching kids to", "85:32", "eat cereal you know it's so crazy and I", "85:35", "put my drain on your bread oh that's the", "85:37", "best that's the the best bad advice that", "85:40", "they ever gave vegetable oils which are", "85:43", "fucking terrible for you all those", "85:45", "disgusting vegetable our and corn oil", "85:49", "all that stuff that's just terrible", "85:51", "terrible for you it is the other thing", "85:54", "that that mothers used to and to some", "85:56", "extent still tell that kids is don't go", "85:58", "hungry have a snack yeah I shouldn't say", "86:02", "mothers parents in general but in my", "86:03", "family it's it's my wife she hates to", "86:06", "see our kids go hungry at all right so", "86:09", "it's always 888 never be hungry and I'm", "86:10", "there saying no be hungry it's good for", "86:12", "you and it's this the same with children", "86:15", "though because children are growing I", "86:16", "always assumed that children did you", "86:18", "just eat whenever they're hungry", "86:19", "well that's what stated I'm not sure if", "86:23", "that's the case often my son is somewhat", "86:29", "my son isn't then put it that way and", "86:31", "he'll we going out the door and my wife", "86:33", "will say have you had breakfast no I'm", "86:36", "not hungry", "86:36", "you have to eat something and I'm", "86:38", "thinking no you got plenty of energy", "86:40", "stored there don't worry about it", "86:42", "yeah I mean it makes sense the only", "86:45", "thing that I think of is that when", "86:48", "you're a young person your body is still", "86:50", "actually growing and developing as", "86:53", "opposed to you and I if we're fasting it", "86:56", "makes sense right it makes sense you're", "86:57", "you're giving your body a break and", "86:59", "there's all sorts of proven benefits to", "87:01", "that fasting process and well if you", "87:04", "have a child who's overweight it is it a", "87:07", "bad thing to skip a meal no no it's not", "87:10", "the one-day thing that worries me about", "87:12", "children that are overweight skipping a", "87:14", "meal though is that they're not as", "87:17", "disciplined and they're not so good", "87:19", "psychologically with struggling and and", "87:22", "having you know having hunger pangs and", "87:26", "that you're gonna fuck their head up", "87:27", "it's great the teachers will probably be", "87:29", "very angry with me that the kids can't", "87:31", "concentrate well it's not just that yeah", "87:33", "the kids can't concentrate but I just I", "87:35", "worry that it's in some way shape or", "87:38", "form abusive like to say hey you're", "87:40", "overweight you need to lose weight like", "87:41", "I don't think they're like I don't think", "87:44", "they're really designed to go without", "87:47", "the way way a grown adult does these are", "87:50", "my own perceptions I think that it's", "87:52", "probably far better to adjust their diet", "87:54", "and if you've got a kid just slowly get", "87:59", "their body weight down with exercise", "88:01", "particularly with resistance training", "88:03", "and doing things that really burn off a", "88:06", "lot of calories and then just get them", "88:07", "off the sugar and then I think the way", "88:10", "it'll slowly slip off probably not even", "88:12", "so slowly if you can really get them off", "88:14", "a significant sugar binge exactly so", "88:17", "that's why I'm taking my son to the gym", "88:19", "as well I agree with that", "88:20", "yeah I'm just just to clarify because I", "88:23", "don't want a bunch of hate mail all I'm", "88:25", "saying is don't force-feed a kid yes yes", "88:28", "yeah don't force-feed a kid yeah I agree", "88:30", "with that but I just think that kids", "88:33", "they just get so fucking hungry man they", "88:35", "get cuz they're out their little bodies", "88:37", "or like little hummingbirds you know", "88:39", "they're burning so much energy yeah they", "88:42", "do", "88:42", "I'm amazing you don't take any other", "88:43", "supplements just vitamin D no", "88:45", "multivitamins you don't want to like", "88:47", "cover all your bases no whole food", "88:49", "supplement like vitamin or a plant-based", "88:52", "supplement that you could take during", "88:54", "the day no none of that um you know I'm", "89:00", "subscribed to the idea that a lot of its", "89:02", "expensive urine and you know I'm testing", "89:05", "myself so I know if I'm deficient in", "89:07", "something bad and all my vitals are", "89:09", "close to optimal mmm so something's out", "89:13", "of whack oh I'll see it probably so you", "89:17", "were saying you'd do things for the", "89:18", "government what do you do did I say that", "89:22", "yeah you said that earlier you said I", "89:23", "should ask you and I didn't he did man", "89:26", "even before the show started I was", "89:28", "outside um I was feeling frisky now that", "89:35", "I've thought about it it's time to go to", "89:37", "jail well talk about the get you in", "89:42", "trouble so let's pause and think this", "89:44", "for a moment the things you can't talk", "89:46", "about please don't there's a lot to talk", "89:49", "about", "89:49", "I just have to make sure it's nothing", "89:51", "that's confidential but there's a lot of", "89:54", "interesting stuff going on on the planet", "89:56", "there's there's areas of bio defense", "89:58", "that are pretty scary", "89:59", "so some nations are apparently working", "90:02", "on using CRISPR and other gene editing", "90:05", "systems and modifying bugs that could", "90:08", "wipe out a few hundred million people", "90:10", "pretty quickly what do you do how do you", "90:12", "detect that even the flu that's a", "90:15", "massive bio threat and it may just be", "90:16", "natural and that could wipe out another", "90:18", "hundred million people like you did", "90:19", "exactly a century ago so I'm work on", "90:23", "that stuff detecting viruses wiping them", "90:26", "out cleaning a room of DNA making sure", "90:29", "that everything's clean I'm so I'll give", "90:33", "you an example so that the Navy SEALs", "90:35", "came up to my lab and they'd like to ask", "90:38", "our group to solve some hard problems", "90:40", "and so the problem they set us on was", "90:42", "how do you kill anthrax say", "90:47", "right now it's very difficult to kill of", "90:48", "course when the anthrax letter was open", "90:50", "in the Senate what was it a number of", "90:52", "years ago it cost 25 million dollars", "90:54", "they had to seal it off and put our Jim", "90:56", "peroxide all over everything destroyed", "90:58", "the computers so they're wondering how", "91:00", "do you kill anthrax safely so that you", "91:03", "don't have to be in a hazmat suit to do", "91:04", "it and so what we came up with after", "91:07", "thinking about it for about a week was", "91:11", "we need a biological solution not a", "91:13", "chemical and we found a an organism that", "91:17", "where its whereabouts I cannot disclose", "91:20", "but it's a very interesting organism", "91:22", "that grows at high temperature and it", "91:24", "destroys all bacterial and viral life", "91:27", "and it wipes it out and it doesn't hurt", "91:29", "humans at all you as or at least in", "91:33", "animal studies you can breathe it in you", "91:34", "can put it anywhere and it's fine so", "91:36", "this is a a cocktail of enzymes that", "91:40", "destroys the microbes including anthrax", "91:44", "so it doesn't have any effect on humans", "91:47", "but what about the bacteria that lives", "91:49", "in our body", "91:50", "well we haven't eaten it yet what we're", "91:53", "hoping to do is to do a clinical trial", "91:55", "soon on removing biofilms so in the", "91:58", "wounds of patients the problem that they", "92:01", "the reason they don't heal very well", "92:02", "especially these diabetic chronic wounds", "92:04", "that by the way that every 10 minutes", "92:06", "someone's losing a limb thanks to that", "92:07", "these biofilms you have to digest them", "92:10", "off and you know how they do it right", "92:11", "now they scrub them off it's horrific", "92:14", "then they cut the skin and they keep", "92:16", "cutting and they cutting and eventually", "92:17", "you lose a limb this looks really", "92:20", "promising in animal studies that we", "92:22", "should be able to not just kill the", "92:24", "bacteria in the wound which is a problem", "92:26", "but get rid of that biofilm that's", "92:28", "amazing so things like Mercer staph", "92:33", "infections exactly so able to stop it in", "92:37", "its tracks before it gets systemic right", "92:39", "spray this stuff on a cruise line for", "92:41", "for the virus norovirus even if it turns", "92:46", "out to be that safe why not just wipe", "92:48", "down schools oh because I always worry", "92:52", "about the the negative aspect like", "92:54", "what's gonna happen like what's what's", "92:56", "gonna be the blowback right like", "92:59", "antibiotics", "93:00", "is with created medicine resistant", "93:03", "antibiotic staph infections right right", "93:07", "right your mind always jumps to the", "93:09", "worst possible it's me bro blow it we'd", "93:12", "make a good good team so I'm the I got a", "93:15", "buddy cop movie yeah let's do it", "93:18", "so we've tested does it induce", "93:20", "antibiotic resistance and so far it's", "93:22", "negative mmm okay interesting oh another", "93:25", "thing I'll tell you so I work with a", "93:28", "company that detects organisms so we", "93:32", "want to detect if there's another virus", "93:33", "coming across the planet so how do you", "93:35", "do that quickly and how do you do it if", "93:37", "you don't know what you're looking for", "93:38", "so we can take a drop of blood or a swab", "93:41", "off the table and we can see all the", "93:44", "organisms that are there we can do your", "93:46", "microbiome but that's easy we can do a", "93:48", "so drop a blood will tell you all the", "93:51", "bacteria and viruses in there and it'll", "93:53", "tell you how to kill it which is great", "93:55", "for healthcare because right now", "93:58", "microbiology labs I've worked in one I", "94:00", "used to swab urine and poop on plates it", "94:03", "was very glamorous that's how it's still", "94:06", "done that is that's 19th century early", "94:08", "20th century technology crawl on a plate", "94:11", "wait a few days see what grows but", "94:13", "that's useless for diseases like viruses", "94:15", "and Lyme disease Lyme disease you know", "94:17", "the one from ticks in you in your spine", "94:19", "my daughter got Lyme disease and she was", "94:23", "really sick she was losing her eyesight", "94:25", "it was serious it got into her brain and", "94:27", "the hospital wouldn't give her that", "94:29", "antibiotic because they the tests", "94:31", "weren't quick enough and they wouldn't", "94:33", "give her the antibiotic until the tests", "94:35", "were positive for insurance reasons and", "94:37", "I said just give me that give me the DNA", "94:38", "of my daughter a spinal fluid I'll test", "94:41", "it they wouldn't do that so I was", "94:43", "furious so I spun out a company out of", "94:47", "my lab with some very smart Pi", "94:49", "informaticians mathematicians software", "94:51", "engineers we built supercomputers to be", "94:54", "able to do this teamed up with a guy in", "94:56", "Stanford my friend I mentioned him", "94:58", "Carlos Bustamante he's the guy that did", "95:00", "oh maybe I shouldn't but he did a famous", "95:03", "person's genome recently he's been", "95:06", "trained on mummies and he did Kennewick", "95:09", "Man and", "95:10", "so this technology can be teamed up with", "95:13", "what I've done to be able to get rid of", "95:15", "all the human DNA out of blood sample", "95:17", "leave the viruses leave the bacteria and", "95:19", "then run that through us a computer", "95:21", "supercomputer all the DNA and tell you", "95:23", "within probably seconds eventually what", "95:27", "it is so my daughter would would have a", "95:29", "diagnosis within eventually will be just", "95:31", "ten minutes instead of waiting a week", "95:33", "Wow", "95:34", "Lyme disease is terrifying there are", "95:37", "there are so many people that are", "95:38", "infected with it and I know personally", "95:40", "maybe ten people that have it and a", "95:43", "couple that have had significant issues", "95:46", "with it that have lasted for years I", "95:48", "know a guy who was hospitalized for a", "95:49", "full year on it it's really bad and it", "95:52", "and it can hide as well that's the", "95:54", "problem yeah and it wrecks joints and a", "95:59", "lot of countries actually deny that they", "96:01", "have lung disease Australia's a good", "96:03", "example people are getting what seems to", "96:05", "be Lyme disease and no one knows if it", "96:07", "is or not give those samples to us we'll", "96:09", "tell you what's in there well it seems", "96:10", "to be very difficult with certain", "96:14", "doctors for them to tell if they don't", "96:16", "see that bull's eye infection", "96:18", "exactly so my daughter our daughter", "96:20", "Natalie a middle daughter she didn't", "96:23", "have a bull's-eye she had nothing the", "96:24", "first things we Bulls are also it's a", "96:26", "inflammation around the bite of the", "96:28", "ticket right and there's a there's the", "96:31", "actual bite and then there's a circle on", "96:34", "the outside of it for whatever reason", "96:36", "this occurs with Lyme disease but", "96:38", "oftentimes goes away quickly so if you", "96:41", "bring a person in and they have the Lyme", "96:42", "disease but they don't have that", "96:43", "bullseye anymore which is what happened", "96:45", "to my friend Steve's son he tried to", "96:48", "tell them that it was Lyme disease they", "96:49", "the doctors were incredulous they didn't", "96:51", "believe him it took till the kid had", "96:54", "Bell's palsy at his face exactly that's", "96:57", "what happened now family it's crazy and", "96:59", "so I was bitten by a tick last year", "97:03", "right behind the knee and it didn't form", "97:05", "a bull's-eye maybe I didn't give it time", "97:07", "but it definitely was a very painful", "97:09", "thing I could tell that there was", "97:12", "something going on it was really itchy", "97:13", "and I went to the pharmacy and I said", "97:16", "can I have the antibiotic it's you know", "97:18", "it's probably cost a few dollars for the", "97:20", "antibiotic and they said no we won't", "97:22", "give it to you till we see a bull's", "97:23", "and you need to bring the ticket while I", "97:26", "didn't bring the tick with me so again", "97:28", "I'm the doctors and nurses worst", "97:29", "nightmare I wouldn't leave until they", "97:31", "gave me the antibiotic and I'm glad", "97:32", "because I don't want to wave the wave", "97:34", "like give it to you they did I wasn't", "97:36", "gonna leave until I got it but I don't", "97:38", "want to wait a week you know I'm", "97:39", "starting to lose my did you get that", "97:42", "with them you say listen you dumb", "97:43", "motherfuckers I'm super smart I work", "97:46", "with jeans no not that occasion it's", "97:50", "temper that's anything but I know you", "97:52", "can always say hey I'm looking for I", "97:54", "start Harvard and then they probably", "97:55", "just really kick you out yeah what do", "97:58", "you say I mean how long did it take", "98:00", "before they listened to you so I went", "98:04", "through it I basically I started", "98:05", "spouting biology so that they knew that", "98:07", "I knew something about it oh it was", "98:09", "about 15 minutes oh that's not bad", "98:11", "they're not you knew what to say I can't", "98:14", "be there for days bye bro trust me right", "98:17", "let me draw you a picture they take yeah", "98:20", "I mean I would just think they'd want to", "98:22", "hand that stuff out quick with so many", "98:24", "people getting it it's so common I mean", "98:26", "we looked at a map recently on the", "98:28", "podcast of Lyme disease infections", "98:30", "across the East Coast and the East Coast", "98:33", "the United States obviously that's where", "98:34", "you live is just a hotbed it's crazy", "98:37", "it's everywhere well it is and I've got", "98:41", "friends on Cape Cod where it's really", "98:42", "prevalent really bad so bad that so they", "98:45", "keep the antibiotic in their kitchen", "98:47", "drawer Jesus and if you catch a quick", "98:51", "enough does it stop it in his tracks", "98:54", "yeah so the real problem is when it gets", "98:56", "into your bloodstream and you don't", "98:57", "treat it long enough or quick off", "98:59", "exactly and so my daughter needed it", "99:01", "what's called a PICC line which has", "99:03", "delivery the antibiotic just straight", "99:04", "into the heart Oh cuz they left it too", "99:06", "long I'd want to kill them and she", "99:08", "didn't have a ring of ring of", "99:11", "inflammation but you knew I didn't I", "99:14", "thought it was meningitidis bacteria in", "99:16", "the brain or something", "99:16", "oh holy leukemia was the other", "99:18", "possibility those dirty fucking bugs", "99:22", "what can be done to somehow another", "99:25", "eradicate those things Oh", "99:28", "so again why not one of my friends got a", "99:31", "few friends here she was working at MIT", "99:33", "and she's developed a way using the", "99:35", "CRISPR system", "99:36", "to kill these as you say damn little", "99:39", "fuckers and so there is possibly going", "99:42", "to be the first test of releasing a", "99:43", "modified organism the lime organism to", "99:46", "kill them off Wow and you know that's", "99:50", "gonna cause some new superbugs it's", "99:52", "gonna kill everybody it's gonna be like", "99:54", "that a Brad Pitt movie the zombie one", "99:56", "World War Z my pee but on the other hand", "100:01", "we might all be saved from Lyme disease", "100:04", "yeah we I would like that that would be", "100:05", "great", "100:06", "I just I mean where did Lyme disease", "100:08", "come from there was some conspiracy", "100:09", "theory website that was thinking that", "100:11", "Lyme disease was some sort of a some", "100:13", "sort of a biological weapon that's", "100:16", "probably bullshit I'm sure but it came", "100:18", "out it was in Lyme Connecticut right it", "100:20", "does it wasn't that one of the first", "100:21", "cases yeah so that's close enough to", "100:25", "Harvard just stayed away it's I thought", "100:29", "he said Russians were behind it", "100:30", "oh no I said conspiracy theory I didn't", "100:34", "say it was Russian but as a biological", "100:35", "weapon it's uh it's just an awful thing", "100:38", "and that and now there's the I'm sure", "100:41", "you're aware of the Lone Star tick that", "100:43", "gives people that alpha-gal the disease", "100:47", "the one that makes you allergic to red", "100:49", "meat mm-hmm just I mean where was that", "100:53", "before it's crazy to see these things", "100:55", "morphing and well they're morphing and", "100:57", "there are a lot of bugs we don't know", "100:58", "somebody just published a few days ago", "101:00", "that they took surveys of the microbiome", "101:03", "on the skin mouth got across the planet", "101:06", "different races different foods", "101:08", "Geographic geography and they have a", "101:11", "hundred thousand different organisms", "101:12", "living on humanity and most of them are", "101:16", "unknown that's crazy right right and all", "101:19", "they have to do is just morph a little", "101:21", "bit one way or the other way and all of", "101:23", "a sudden people are dropping like flies", "101:25", "yeah and what's interesting is on the", "101:27", "skin and in the gut of people in India", "101:29", "is very different than what we have and", "101:32", "it different smells yeah they probably", "101:34", "think we smell that but I know this", "101:37", "because well they're wrong yeah right", "101:39", "yeah I smell like Old Spice but these", "101:44", "wounds they're actually if you want to", "101:46", "kill bacteria in a wound they're", "101:47", "different in the wounds of", "101:49", "people in India than they are over here", "101:50", "oh wow that's interesting and obviously", "101:54", "they have different diets too so there's", "101:55", "probably different things they're used", "101:57", "to consuming and so their gut bacteria", "101:59", "is different right everything's", "102:02", "different that genomes are different so", "102:03", "we need to map the globe to first know", "102:06", "what we're dealing with before we can", "102:07", "address them it just seems like a", "102:09", "never-ending struggle it every day is a", "102:14", "struggle against the natural world they", "102:16", "want to kill us and he is yeah", "102:18", "everything the little things and the big", "102:20", "things all of it", "102:21", "Wow their food so how much of your time", "102:25", "gets consumed with this kind of work uh", "102:28", "well it's so everything's all consuming", "102:30", "my typical day is at a going to a", "102:34", "company meeting going to US government", "102:37", "game called by Senator for an update so", "102:41", "probably actually let me be formal about", "102:44", "this Harvard University allows me to", "102:47", "spend twenty percent of my time outside", "102:49", "of the university so it's nineteen point", "102:51", "nine hmm you have to cover your ass here", "102:55", "is that we just did maybe but he tracks", "103:00", "their time now anymore but I would think", "103:01", "that with a guy like you who's so you", "103:05", "concentrate so much you're so focused on", "103:08", "anti anti anti aging that having a", "103:11", "gigantic workload would seem to me to be", "103:15", "that would be an issue in terms of like", "103:18", "over taxing your system stressing", "103:19", "yourself out so nobody's ever asked me", "103:22", "that and it's a really good question but", "103:26", "I'm not really worried about dying", "103:27", "actually I'm not worried at all at all I", "103:31", "know is you know it was a wolf in the", "103:33", "room he's staring at ya you know where a", "103:35", "grisly death I'd probably not want that", "103:37", "but I've been I thought I was gonna die", "103:41", "on aeroplanes before and I'm pretty calm", "103:45", "about that so I guess that's a good test", "103:46", "but I do want to leave a legacy I want", "103:49", "to be able to say the world's better for", "103:51", "me being on the planet and so that's why", "103:54", "I do all this stuff though I try to", "103:55", "protect the humanity I try to

out why they run", "107:26", "further this isn't just try it and see", "107:29", "we've figured out that that the lining", "107:31", "of the blood vessels needs nad as you", "107:33", "get older",

it I wonder if", "109:26", "that would help me uh yeah I really", "109:30", "couldn't say what's the call again", "109:32", "which one the drug that was tested yeah", "109:34", "um it has a name SRT 2104 and this is", "109:40", "the stuff that he worked on psoriasis", "109:41", "yeah in a small study in New York yeah", "109:44", "hmm now what other what other things had", "109:49", "really dramatic results on humans well", "109:52", "we're not there yet we don't have", "109:54", "dramatic results is there anything", "109:55", "promising results on humans other than", "109:58", "nmn yes

look better", "110:49", "can I look better Yeah right and the", "110:52", "answer is that a we don't know B we're", "110:56", "working on it we have we work with a", "110:58", "cosmetic company that so far so good but", "111:01", "I don't endorse products that's not me", "111:04", "but also what's interesting is that", "111:06", "these mice at least they stay younger", "111:08", "looking as well they don't just live", "111:10", "longer hmm um so this hope that I mean", "111:14", "the skin is a big organ okay so right", "111:16", "why wouldn't it stay young just like the", "111:18", "rest of the body", "111:19", "well it's certainly indicative of", "111:22", "whether or not a person is healthy right", "111:23", "if you see someone and their skin is", "111:25", "really saggy and fucked up

you", "112:45", "take someone like a a wealthy Mel Gibson", "112:49", "type character and just shoot them up", "112:51", "with everything like just", "112:54", "get someone who's willing to give you a", "112:57", "full run of them and run it like out", "112:59", "like some sort of a science fiction", "113:00", "movie tell you what I'll do it if you'll", "113:02", "employ me because I'll be kicked

document you", "113:14", "could take one person it was like a", "113:16", "wealthy man is mid to late 60s well that", "113:21", "there's this orange element in", "113:23", "anti-aging in fact I don't even like the", "113:25", "term anti-aging it's what do you like", "113:27", "longevity research we're about to", "113:30", "announce maybe this is a sneak preview", "113:33", "for everybody an

nonsense it's not really", "113:55", "anti-aging you're not doing anything", "113:57", "about aging you're just freezing your", "113:59", "skin so it doesn't move that is that to", "114:01", "me is one of the weirder things", "114:03", "especially with men when I see a man as", "114:06", "forehead doesn't move I want to smack", "114:07", "him in the mouth like what's wrong with", "114:09", "you sir how dare you respect it just", "114:12", "it's not it's a it's not like Botox or", "114:17", "fillers or any of those things you're", "114:19", "not doing anything for your health or", "114:22", "your actual real vitality you're just", "114:24", "weirdly doing something cosmetic right", "114:28", "yes you are and though I think the", "114:31", "defense is you feel better if you look", "114:33", "better mmm psychologically it might help", "114:35", "I don't think they look better though", "114:37", "they just look different yeah what's the", "114:39", "problem it is true yeah I don't spend a", "114:43", "lot of time thinking about the cosmetic", "114:45", "industry for obvious reasons I'm trying", "114:47", "to save humanity and and improve the", "114:50", "planet actually I

weird you're not", "115:02", "allowed in the club of advanced species", "115:04", "well well that would only be one thing", "115:06", "that we were", "115:07", "from yeah you know but what would they", "115:10", "ask you they well they'd ask us have you", "115:11", "figured out the speed of light did ask", "115:13", "me why I have drawings all over my arm", "115:15", "no no they might appreciate art maybe", "115:19", "but like they'd be like why didn't you", "115:22", "just get it and then wash it off or", "115:23", "something why have to get it drilled in", "115:25", "your skin - well not that's coming but I", "115:27", "think what are that one of the most", "115:29", "important questions they'd asked to tell", "115:31", "if we are an advanced nation or advanced", "115:32",

"115:43", "thing you can do something about that", "115:45", "and they're like come back in a thousand", "115:47", "years well I mean there's gotta be you", "115:50", "think worldwide are working in your", "115:52", "field sometimes of leading labs there's", "115:56", "about twenty thirty broadly there's a", "116:00", "probably a few hundred labs and are they", "116:02", "all in essentially the same field of", "116:04", "study they're all working with the same", "116:06", "molecules and the same parameters know", "116:09", "that not everyone works with molecules", "116:12", "but what I can tell you is we get", "116:13", "together in conferences and we talk", "116:14", "about discovering new gene that extends", "116:17", "lifespan and a new molecule that's", "116:18", "working in mice or

start when it was really", "116:31", "small and stick it out those fair amount", "116:34", "of criticism in those days what how so", "116:36", "like that it was like a lot of my", "116:38", "friends my supervisor said I was insane", "116:40", "for working on Aging that's not a thing", "116:42", "that's not biology really yeah Wow wait", "116:45", "how long ago was this so I came to the", "116:47", "u.s. from Sydney in 1995 went to MIT and", "116:51", "the scientists in the lab that I joined", "116:54", "Lenny gurantees lab they two students", "116:58", "had just started working to

nuts meanwhile", "117:27", "you were right well you got to take some", "117:30", "risks in life that's one lesson yeah but", "117:33", "that's an interesting one right because", "117:34", "you were a young fellow he didn't really", "117:37", "totally know it was pretty lucky because", "117:40", "I'm in Australia right I don't know what", "117:42", "people are saying about this lab Sheila",

definitely", "118:06", "forgive people too much had some pretty", "118:09", "big enemies along the way that I try to", "118:10", "be nice is it because research and this", "118:14", "sort of scientific work is so", "118:16", "competitive yeah it is it is and there's", "118:19", "this belief that someone's success is", "118:21", "your failure it's not really that that", "118:22", "is the case but you don't exist in show", "118:25", "business - it's a weird sort of mindset", "118:28", "it's a very limiting mindset right and", "118:31", "also and this may be true in Hollywood",

your new findings will", "119:20", "make their work look irrelevant yes it's", "119:25", "probably better both but mostly it's", "119:27", "it's that they're worried that their", "119:28", "lives will

there even before then let's", "121:16", "now we have new things to study they", "121:18", "don't look at it that way though yeah", "121:20", "see the problem with with how biology", "121:22", "and actually most facts are taught or", "121:24", "theories are taught is that there's a", "121:26", "textbook and that's the Bible : what I", "121:31", "try to teach my students is can you", "121:33", "please just forget everything you just", "121:34", "learnt and what's important to know is", "121:36", "that most things we think we know are", "121:38", "not correct they're going to change over",

cherish", "121:59", "the fact that you've helped us get to", "122:00", "that point because without Newton we", "122:02", "wouldn't have gone in physics well for", "122:04", "someone like me hearing you say that", "122:05", "it's very promising and it's it's it's", "122:08", "very encouraging but I always thought", "122:12", "that scientists were always going on", "122:16", "just data like the all they cared about", "122:19", "was data all they cared about is what is", "122:22", "correct and that was what was crucial", "122:24", "that's what's important this is what", "122:26", "they talk about this is what they study", "122:27", "when I found out that scientist would", "122:30", "would ignore information or use their", "122:34", "own personal biases against information", "122:36", "or

you're wrong", "123:03", "this is crap and where are they now do", "123:06", "you call them up in the middle of night", "123:07", "they still home up you've done wrong", "123:10", "fuckers right I have a couple of glass", "123:12", "of wine yeah well I think the secret to", "123:15", "success in life is actually just", "123:17", "existing for long enough and all your", "123:19", "enemies to fall away yeah well they die", "123:21", "they're not into anti-aging yeah I look", "123:24", "like shit I can't walk anymore just have", "123:26", "to outlive your enemies yeah it's an", "123:28",

"123:45", "back to lab and you retest it so I went", "123:48", "through a really brutal period in my", "123:49", "career where we had data we interpreted", "123:52", "it we published it in the top journals", "123:54", "and it was about how resveratrol works", "123:57", "on", "123:57", "that sort to an enzyme that I mentioned", "123:59", "and Pfizer came out with a paper that", "124:03", "said it's all wrong", "124:04", "and I had people call me up saying it", "124:07", "was nice knowing you I'm really sad for", "124:09", "you but it's over yeah bad boohead luck", "124:13", "and so I went back to the lab we had", "124:15", "some data already from years before", "124:17", "which I knew were interesting and it", "124:20", "took another thing four years to get to", "124:22", "the bottom

well sure that was happening to my", "125:37", "lab we went down to four people I mean", "125:39", "and what was the higher I mean these", "125:41", "days I'm but what were not before then", "125:43",

damn", "126:01", "that's crazy", "126:04", "well sciences is not for the faint of", "126:06", "heart", "126:06", "I would imagine yeah yeah boy they", "126:10", "skin stubbornness only only those", "126:13", "survived what was the turnaround like", "126:19", "was there a moment where it turned", "126:21", "around and moved in waters favor yeah", "126:23", "there was there was one day when it when", "126:25", "it all changed so the earlier data so", "126:28", "what data driven the early data was that", "126:29", "the enzyme we could we could mutate or", "126:34", "change the enzyme so that it wasn't", "126:36", "going to be activated by research role", "126:38", "and we found that mutation now that just", "126:41", "technically or non technically", "126:43", "technically means that we could change", "126:46", "the enzyme in a way that wouldn't work", "126:47", "so we then put that non working enzyme", "126:50", "into a cell and now we have a mouse that", "126:52", "doesn't work and we give it resveratrol", "126:55", "and if it if it works", "126:57", "it means I'm wrong if it doesn't work", "126:59", "and it's blocked by that change in the", "127:01", "enzyme we're probably right and that's", "127:03", "what we did but the real the real change", "127:06", "was that there was a company that I", "127:08", "started that was making drugs the one", "127:11", "that cured or at least seemed to cure", "127:13", "psoriasis and they had made these very", "127:17", "synthetic molecules that were not", "127:19", "related to the plant molecule research", "127:21", "well and so I said to myself and to the", "127:24", "student who was working on it a very", "127:26", "brave student if if the change in that", "127:29", "enzyme also blocks the drug then we're", "127:32", "on to something because that means two", "127:35", "separate groups working on separate", "127:37", "types of molecules", "127:38", "different people different systems all", "127:42", "get blocked by this one little change in", "127:44", "the enzyme then we're right and and so", "127:46", "he walked over to the company he got the", "127:48", "molecule through it on the enzyme and it", "127:50", "didn't work on the mutant and that was", "127:53", "me rejoicing because I could say there", "127:57", "is a universal activation mechanism on", "127:59", "this one enzyme resveratrol works the", "128:03",

couple of years of", "128:25", "hell right it gets so bad because you've", "128:29", "got this tight-knit group of scientists", "128:31", "and you have lab meetings and you", "128:32", "present your results and usually you're", "128:34", "very supportive trying to help I had one", "128:36", "guy saying to my student David doesn't", "128:39", "always talking about you shouldn't work", "128:40",

definitely", "129:19", "healthier approach I'm kidding I", "129:21", "probably would do exactly what you did", "129:23", "but it stills got to be beautiful to", "129:24", "come out on the other end

I pause and I remember", "129:39", "how hard it was to get here and how", "129:41", "fortunate I am to have made it this far", "129:42", "and I'm working with hundreds of", "129:45", "collaborators

see", "131:08", "that people put my name and my face all", "131:10", "the time on their websites and I get", "131:12", "questions every day every morning I wake", "131:14", "up which product are you

to", "133:53", "try out on people what is that process", "133:56", "so it's a few years of often making a", "134:00", "better molecule but let's say you've", "134:01", "done that work now you you spend a year", "134:04", "testing it on at least two different", "134:07", "species usually a rodent a mouse and a", "134:10", "dog and but you try to do everything you", "134:13", "can before that to make sure it's not", "134:15", "going to be unsafe testing our own cells", "134:17", "and other things that are not living or", "134:19", "at least not not don't feel anything but", "134:22", "the FDA Food and Drug Administration of", "134:25", "the u.s. requires if you can make a drug", "134:27", "you have to test it on at least two", "134:28", "different species so that's what you do", "134:30", "and then it's you're going to what's", "134:32", "called phase one which is safety testing", "134:34", "takes one to two years Phase two is what", "134:37", "we call efficacy which is does it really", "134:39", "work potentially so you test that on 50", "134:42", "to 100 people maybe it works maybe it", "134:45", "doesn't most things fail if it looks", "134:47", "good then you go into Phase three which", "134:48", "is 50 to 200 million dollars worth of", "134:51", "experiments I'm testing it on hundreds", "134:54", "of patients and if that goes well then", "134:56", "you apply to the FDA", "134:57", "to be licensed at the seller drug so the", "135:00", "amount of money that it must cost to", "135:03", "bring something to of my ears open", "135:06", "you're like oh it's it's hard", "135:08", "must be staggering it's it's staggering", "135:11", "to raise that much money and that that's", "135:13", "one of the reasons that these big", "135:15", "numbers come up often we have to tap the", "135:19", "public markets to be able to afford it a", "135:21", "typical drug will cost in hundreds of", "135:24", "millions of dollars some drugs have", "135:26", "failed after 700 million dollars", "135:27", "investment oh yeah but but look at the", "135:30", "upside if we're successful at having a", "135:32", "drug that treats aging you know we'll", "135:37", "treat a disease like diabetes first but", "135:39", "then it could become the best-selling", "135:41", "drug of all time if it's proven safe who", "135:45", "wouldn't want to have a drug that could", "135:47",

"research money right is that how it", "135:55", "works that's how it usually works but", "135:59", "for the first time I'm in control of", "136:02", "many of these companies and I have a", "136:04",

is", "136:17", "a gift to the world and so that's a very", "136:18", "different approach and that's one of the", "136:20", "reasons that I've in large part use my", "136:21", "own money to do these things so I can", "136:23", "have that say and do what's right for", "136:25", "the planet so when you do do that how", "136:29", "will you decide how much something costs", "136:31", "based on the

know there's that there's a", "136:42", "nice middle ground what right you don't", "136:44", "want to be like that guy that went to", "136:45", "jail for the AIDS drug what's that", "136:46",
