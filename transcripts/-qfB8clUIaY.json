been", "00:16", "looking at some of your shows in the", "00:18", "last last few days just to to get a", "00:21", "sense of how you're thinking about AI", "00:23", "and crypto and the various other things", "00:25", "I'm involved in it's been interesting", "00:28", "well I've been following you as well", "00:29", "I've been paying attention to a lot of", "00:31", "your lectures and talks and different", "00:33", "things you've done over the last couple", "00:34", "days as well getting ready for this", "00:36", "it's a AI is either people are really", "00:40", "excited about it or they're

recent years is", "01:12", "many people are now you know mentally", "01:15", "confronting all the issues of writing AI", "01:17", "for the first time and I I mean I've", "01:19", "been working on AI for three decades and", "01:23", "I first started thinking about AI when I", "01:25", "was a little kid in the early late 60s", "01:29", "and early 70s when I saw a eyes and", "01:31", "robots on the original Star Trek so I", "01:33", "guess I've had a lot of cycles to", "01:36", "process the positives and negatives of", "01:40", "it where it's now like suddenly most of", "01:43", "the world is

life being biological being", "02:45", "carbon-based tissue and cells and blood", "02:48", "and or insects or mammals or fish or are", "02:52", "we married to that too much do you think", "02:54",

oh yeah I think it's it's", "11:30", "almost inevitable by this point that", "11:35", "humanity is going to create synthetic", "11:38", "intelligences with tremendously greater", "11:42", "general

what", "13:03", "we are yeah or that is essentially", "13:06", "indifferent to human values and culture", "13:08", "in the same way that we're mostly", "13:10", "indifferent to chimpanzee values and",

we would", "13:33", "like the super ai's to care about us", "13:35", "more than we care about insects or", "13:37", "gradation solutely right and I think", "13:41", "this this is something we can impact", "13:43", "right now and to to be honest I mean in", "13:49", "a certain part of my mind I can think", "13:51", "well like in the end I don't matter that", "13:55", "much my four kids don't matter that much", "13:57", "my granddaughter doesn't matter that", "13:59", "much like we are patterns of", "14:01", "organization in a very long lineage of", "14:04", "patterns of organization and they matter", "14:06", "very much to you yeah and another you", "14:08", "know dinosaurs came in one and the under", "14:11", "thoughts came in what humans may come", "14:13", "and go the a is that we create may come", "14:16", "and go and that's the nature of the", "14:18", "universe but on the other hand of course", "14:20", "in my heart from my situated perspective", "14:24", "as an individual human like if some AI", "14:27", "tried to annihilate my my ten month old", "14:31", "son that would try to kill that AI right", "14:33", "like so as as a human being situated in", "14:37", "this specific you know species place and", "14:40", "time I care a lot about the condition of", "14:43", "all of us humans and so I would like to", "14:48", "not only create a powerful general", "14:50",

you know the", "16:13", "basic algorithms of artificial cognition", "16:16", "is the issue that the initial creation", "16:19", "would be subject to our programming but", "16:22", "that it could

took the approach of trying to", "17:05", "teach the kids what my values were not", "17:08", "just by preaching at them by entering", "17:10", "wisdom into shared situations but then", "17:14", "you know when your kids grow up they're", "17:16", "gonna go in their own different", "17:18", "directions right and these are humans", "17:20", "but but they all have the same sort of", "17:22",

don't I haven't", "18:19", "gone to church ever I guess I mean my my", "18:23", "mother is lesbian right I mean there's", "18:25", "all these things that we take for", "18:28", "granted now that not

my", "18:52", "childhood I lived in New Jersey for nine", "18:56", "years of my childhood and just the level", "18:59", "of racism and anti-semitism and sexism", "19:02", "that were just I'm ambient

okay so I was there", "19:18", "from 67 to 73 oh yeah yeah so yeah I", "19:24", "mean like my I mean my sister went to", "19:28", "the high school from with a with a black", "19:30", "guy and so we got our car turned upside", "19:33", "down the windows of our house smashed it", "19:34", "was like a you humongous thing and it's", "19:38", "almost unbelievable now right because", "19:40", "not",

example of that like", "57:04", "when the open source movement started", "57:06", "they weren't thinking about machine", "57:08", "learning but you know the the", "57:10", "that open-source is out

get to participate", "57:50", "and use each other's work right right", "57:54", "but blockchain is confusing for a lot of", "57:56", "people yeah please explain that sure I", "57:59", "mean but block blockchain itself is", "58:02", "almost a misnomer so we're confused okay", "58:04", "they're confusing it at every level", "58:06", "right so we can should start with the", "58:10", "idea of a distributed ledger which is", "58:12", "basically like a distributed Excel", "58:15", "spreadsheet or database it's just a", "58:17", "store of information which is not stored", "58:20", "just in one

then then there's various bells and", "58:31", "whistles like sharding where you know it", "58:33", "can be broken in many pieces and each", "58:35", "piece is stored many places or something", "58:37", "so that's a distributed ledger and", "58:39", "that's just distributed computing now", "58:41", "what what makes it more interesting is", "58:44", "when you layer it decentralized control", "58:47", "onto that so imagine you have this", "58:49", "distributed Excel spreadsheet or", "58:51", "distributed database there's copies of", "58:53", "it stored in a thousand places but to", "58:56", "update it you need like five hundred of", "58:58", "those thousand people who own the copies", "59:00", "to vote yeah let's do that update right", "59:02", "so then then you have a distributed", "59:05", "store of data and you have like a", "59:07", "democratic voting mechanism to determine", "59:09", "when all those copies can get can get", "59:12", "updated together right so then then what", "59:14", "you have is a data storage and update", "59:17", "mechanism that's controlled in a", "59:19", "democratic way by the group of", "59:21", "participants rather than mining one", "59:22", "central control", "59:24", "and that that can have all sorts of", "59:26", "advantages I mean for one thing it means", "59:28", "that you know there's no one controller", "59:30", "who can go rogue and screw with all the", "59:32", "day without telling anyone it also means", "59:34", "there's no one who's some lunatic can go", "59:36", "hold a gun to their head and shoot them", "59:38", "for for what data updates were made cuz", "59:41", "they're you know it's controlled", "59:42", "democratically by by everybody right it", "59:44", "has ramifications in terms of you know", "59:47", "legal defensibility and I mean you could", "59:50", "have some people and Iran some in China", "59:52", "some in the US and and updates to this", "59:55", "whole distributed data store are made by", "59:58", "democratic decision of all the", "60:00", "participants somewhere cryptography", "60:02", "comes in is when I vote I don't have to", "60:05", "say yeah this is been Gertz all voting", "60:07", "for this update to be accepted or not", "60:08", "it's just ID number one three five seven", "60:11", "two six four and then encryption is used", "60:14", "to make sure that you know it's it's the", "60:17", "same guy voting every time that it", "60:21", "claims to be with it without needing", "60:23", "like your passport number or something", "60:26", "right what's ironic about is it's", "60:27", "probably one of the best ways ever", "60:28", "conceived to actually vote in this", "60:31", "country yeah sure kind of ironic there's", "60:34", "a lot of applications for that yeah", "60:37", "that's that's right so that there's so", "60:41", "that that I mean that's the core", "60:42", "mechanism though where the blockchain", "60:44", "comes from is like a data structure", "60:47", "where to store the data in this", "60:49", "distributed database it's stored in in a", "60:52", "chain of blocks or each block contains", "60:54", "data the thing is not every so

it's an", "61:07", "alright term is it like AI like just one", "61:10", "of those terms were stuck with yeah yeah", "61:11", "it's one it's one of those terms were", "61:12", "stuck with even though it's not quite", "61:14", "technically not quite technically", "61:17", "accurate and I mean anymore I mean", "61:19", "because what I don't know another buzz", "61:22", "word for it right what it is is a it's a", "61:24", "distributed ledger with encryption a", "61:26", "decentralized control", "61:27", "yeah and blockchain is the buzzword", "61:29", "that's come about for that know what", "61:31", "what got me interested in blockchain", "61:34", "really is this decentralized control us", "61:37", "so my my wife why been with for 10 years", "61:40", "now she dug up recently something I'd", "61:42", "forgotten which is a webpage had made in", "61:44", "1995 like a long time ago where I'd said", "61:48", "hey I'm gonna run for president on the", "61:51", "decentralization platform for her which", "61:54", "I'd completely forgotten that crazy idea", "61:55", "I was very young then that had no idea", "61:58", "what an annoying job being president", "61:59", "would be right but that so that the idea", "62:03", "of decentralized control seemed very", "62:07", "important to me back then which is well", "62:09", "before Bitcoin was invented because I", "62:11", "could see you know a global brain is", "62:14", "evolving on the planet involving humans", "62:16", "computers communication devices and we", "62:19", "don't want this global brain to be", "62:21", "controlled by a small elite we want the", "62:23", "global prime to be controlled in the in", "62:24", "the decentralized ways so that that's", "62:28", "really the the beauty of this blockchain", "62:31", "infrastructure and what what got me", "62:33", "interested in the practical technologies", "62:35", "of blockchain was really one theory", "62:38", "inque mout and you add the notion of a", "62:41", "smart contract which was a theorem a", "62:43", "theory amia so what is that well so the", "62:47", "first blockchain technology was Bitcoin", "62:49", "right which is a well known", "62:50", "cryptocurrency no theory 'm is another", "62:54", "cryptocurrency which is the number two", "62:56", "cryptocurrency right now that's how out", "62:59", "of the loop I am did you know about it", "63:00", "you did however aetherium came along", "63:04", "with a really nice software framework so", "63:07", "it's not just like a digital money like", "63:10", "bitcoin is but aetherium has a", "63:14", "programming language called solidity", "63:17", "that came with it and this programming", "63:19", "language lets you write what are called", "63:21", "smart contracts and again that's sort of", "63:24", "a misnomer because a smart contract", "63:25", "doesn't have to be either smart or a", "63:28", "contract right but but it was a cool", "63:30", "name right what are you in then if it's", "63:32", "really a smart contract contract it's", "63:35", "like a programmable transaction okay so", "63:38", "you you can program a legal contract or", "63:41", "you can program of a financial", "63:42", "transaction so a smart contract it's a", "63:47", "it's a persistent piece of software", "63:50", "that embodies like a secure encrypted", "63:52", "transaction between between multiple", "63:55", "parties so pretty much like anything on", "63:58", "the back end of a bank's website or", "64:02", "transaction between two companies online", "64:05", "a purchasing relationship between you", "64:07", "and the website online this could all be", "64:09", "scripted in the smart contract in the", "64:12", "secure way and then it would be", "64:14", "automated in this simple and standard", "64:15", "way so the vision that Vitalik butyrin", "64:18", "who was the main creator behind", "64:20", "aetherium had is to basically make the", "64:23", "internet into a giant computing", "64:26", "mechanism rather than mostly like an", "64:28", "information storage and retrieval", "64:30", "mechanism make the internet into a giant", "64:33", "computer by making a really simple", "64:35", "programming language for scripting", "64:38", "transactions among different computers", "64:40", "and different parties on the internet", "64:41", "where you have encryption and you have", "64:44", "democratic decision-making and", "64:46", "distributed storage of information like", "64:48", "programmed into this this world computer", "64:50", "right and then that was a really cool", "64:53", "idea and the etherium blockchain and", "64:55", "solidity programming language made it", "64:57", "really easy to do that so made it really", "64:59", "easy to program like distributed secure", "65:02", "transaction and computing systems on the", "65:05", "internet so I saw this I thought wow", "65:08", "like now we finally have the toolset", "65:12", "that's needed to implement some of these", "65:14", "pillars it's very popular yeah I mean I", "65:17", "mean basically almost every ICO that was", "65:21", "done the last couple years was done on", "65:23", "the ethereum blockchain", "65:24", "what's an ICO initial coin offering okay", "65:27", "so for bitcoins for I'm sorry", "65:30", "cryptocurrency crypto currencies yeah", "65:32", "use this technology yeah yes rings right", "65:35", "so what happened in the last couple", "65:36", "years is a bunch of people realized you", "65:41", "could use this aetherium programming", "65:45", "framework to create a new cryptocurrency", "65:48", "right like a new artificial money and", "65:51", "then you could try to get people to use", "65:54", "your new artificial money for certain", "65:56", "types of how many artificial coral coin", "65:58", "thousands maybe more", "66:00", "and but I mean how many popular is", "66:03", "Bitcoin right the point is Bitcoin is by", "66:06", "far the most popular the most aetherium", "66:08", "is number two and there's a bunch of", "66:10", "others I mean how would comparison like", "66:12", "how much bigger is Bitcoin than", "66:14", "aetherium I don't know five factor of", "66:18", "three to five yeah well maybe just a", "66:21", "factor of two no it's actually last year", "66:24", "at thorium almost took over Bitcoin when", "66:27", "Bitcoin start crashing yeah yeah and now", "66:29", "a theorem is back down it might be 1/2", "66:31", "or 1/3 does that worry you the the", "66:33", "fluctuating value of these well to my to", "66:37", "my mind creating artificial monies is", "66:40", "one tiny bit of the potential of what", "66:45", "you could do with the whole blotching", "66:47", "tool said it it happened to become", "66:50", "popular initially right because it's", "66:54", "where the money is right it is it is", "66:57", "money and that's interesting to people", "66:59", "but on the other hand what it's really", "67:02", "about is making world computer it's", "67:05", "about scripting with a simple", "67:08", "programming language all sorts of", "67:10", "transactions between people companies", "67:13", "whatever all sorts of exchanges of", "67:16", "information so I mean it's about", "67:18", "decentralized voting mechanisms it's", "67:20", "about AI is being able to send data and", "67:23", "processing it for each other and pay", "67:26", "each other for their transactions so I", "67:28", "mean there's it's about automating", "67:30", "supply chains and and and shipping and", "67:33", "ecommerce so that there's an in in in in", "67:36", "essence you know just like computers and", "67:39", "the internet started with a certain", "67:42", "small set of applications and then", "67:44", "pervaded almost everything right yeah", "67:46", "it's the same way with blockchain", "67:48", "technology like it started with digital", "67:50", "money but the core technology is is", "67:53", "gonna pervade almost everything because", "67:56", "there's almost no domain of human", "67:57", "pursuit that couldn't use like security", "68:01", "through cryptography some sort of you", "68:04", "know participatory decision-making and", "68:06", "then distributed storage of information", "68:08", "right so and these things are also", "68:10", "valuable for AI which is how I got into", "68:13", "it in the first place I mean", "68:14", "if you're making a very very powerful AI", "68:17", "that is going to you know gradually", "68:21", "through the practical value delivers he", "68:23", "will grow up to be more and more and", "68:25", "more intelligent I mean that this AI", "68:27", "should be able to engage a large party", "68:29", "of people and AIS and participatory", "68:31", "decision-making they I should be able to", "68:34", "store information you know in a widely", "68:36", "distributed way and and they I certainly", "68:39", "shouldn't be able to use you know", "68:41", "security and encryption to validate who", "68:43", "are the parties involved in its", "68:45", "operation I mean these are the key", "68:47", "things behind behind blockchain", "68:48", "technology so I mean the fact the fact", "68:51", "that blockchain began with artificial", "68:53", "currencies to me is a detail of history", "68:56", "just like the fact the fact that the", "68:58", "internet began is like a nuclear early", "69:00", "warning system right then it did it's", "69:03", "good for that but it's as it happens", "69:05", "it's also even better for a lot of other", "69:07", "things yeah the the solution for the", "69:11", "financial situation that we find", "69:13", "ourselves in it's one of the more", "69:14", "interesting things about", "69:17", "cryptocurrencies that someone said okay", "69:19", "look obviously we all kind of agree that", "69:22", "our financial institutions are very", "69:23", "flawed the system that we operate under", "69:25", "is it's very fucked up so how do we fix", "69:28", "that", "69:28", "well sending the super nerds and so they", "69:31", "figure out a new and we're going to send", "69:33", "into super is super super I mean", "69:38", "obviously who's the guy that they think", "69:40", "the this fake person this may be not", "69:43", "real that came up with Bitcoin", "69:45", "oh so Toshi Nakamoto do you have any", "69:47", "suspicions as to who this is I can", "69:51", "neither confirm nor deny okay yeah you", "69:54", "wouldn't be on the inside we'll talk", "69:55", "later", "69:56", "but that this is it's very it's very", "70:01", "interesting but it's also very promising", "70:03", "I I've like high optimism for crypto", "70:06", "currencies because I think that kids", "70:09", "today are looking at it with much more", "70:11", "open eyes than you know grandfather's", "70:14", "grandfather's are looking at Bitcoin", "70:16", "again I'm sure you're exceptional one", "70:20", "but there's a lot of people that are", "70:23", "older that just they're not open to", "70:25", "accepting these ideas but I think", "70:28", "kids today in particular the ones that", "70:30", "have grown up with the internet as a", "70:32", "constant force in their life they're I", "70:35", "think they're more likely to embrace", "70:36", "something along those lines well yet so", "70:39", "that there's no doubt that you know", "70:41", "cryptographic formulations of money are", "70:46", "going to become the standard the", "70:48", "question do you think that's going to be", "70:50", "the standard that will happen yeah", "70:52", "however it could happen potentially in", "70:55", "the very uninteresting way how's that", "70:57", "but you could just have the e dollar I", "71:00", "mean the I mean that government could", "71:02", "just say we will create this", "71:03", "cryptographic token which counts as a", "71:06", "dollar I mean most dollars are just", "71:08", "electronic anyway all right so so what", "71:10", "what what habitually happens is", "71:13", "technologies that are invented to", "71:15", "subvert the establishment are converted", "71:18", "to a form where they help bolster the", "71:21", "establishment instead I mean and in", "71:24", "financial services this happens very", "71:26", "rapidly like PayPal Peter Thiel and", "71:29", "those guys started PayPal thinking they", "71:31", "were gonna obsolete fiat currency and", "71:33", "make an alternative to the currencies", "71:36", "run by nation-states instead they were", "71:39", "driven to make it a credit card", "71:40", "processing front end right so so that's", "71:44", "one thing that could happen with", "71:46", "cryptocurrency is it just becomes a", "71:48", "mechanism for you know governments and", "71:51", "big companies and banks to do the things", "71:54", "more efficiently so what what's", "71:57", "interesting isn't so much the digital", "71:59", "money aspect although it is in some ways", "72:01", "a great way to do digital money but", "72:04", "what's interesting is with all the", "72:07", "flexibility it gives you to script you", "72:10", "know complex computing networks in there", "72:14", "is the possibility to script new forms", "72:16", "of you know participatory Democratic", "72:20", "self-organizing networks so blockchain", "72:23", "like the internet or computing is a very", "72:26", "flexible medium you could use it to make", "72:28", "tools of oppression or or you could use", "72:31", "it to make tools of amazing growth", "72:32", "growth and and liberation and obviously", "72:36", "we know which one I'm more interested in", "72:37", "ya know what what is blockchain", "72:42", "what is blockchain being currently used", "72:44", "for like what what different", "72:46", "applications cuz it's not just", "72:47", "cryptocurrency they use know a bunch of", "72:50", "different things now right they are I", "72:51", "would say it's very early stage so", "72:55", "probably the how early well", "72:58", "the heaviest uses a blockchain now are", "73:01", "probably inside large financial services", "73:03", "companies actually so if you look at", "73:06", "theory him the project dimensions so he", "73:10", "theorem is run by an open source and", "73:12", "open foundation the etherium foundation", "73:15", "then there's a consulting company called", "73:18", "consensus which is a totally separate", "73:20", "organization that was founded by joe", "73:23", "Lubin who was one of the founders of", "73:24", "etherium in the early days and consensus", "73:27", "as you know it's funded about to the", "73:29", "work within the etherium foundation and", "73:32", "community but consensus has done a lot", "73:35", "of contracts just working with", "73:37", "governments and big companies to", "73:39", "customize code based on etherium to help", "73:42", "with their internal operations so", "73:44", "actually a lot of the practical value", "73:47", "has been with stuff that isn't in the", "73:49", "public odd that much but it's like", "73:51", "back-end inside of companies and in", "73:55", "terms of practical customer facing uses", "73:59", "of of cryptocurrency i mean now the tron", "74:03", "blockchain which is different than", "74:05", "aetherium that has a bunch of games on", "74:07", "it for example and some online gambling", "74:09", "for the for that mother so that that's", "74:11", "that that's gotten a lot of users but", "74:14", "their online games like how do they use", "74:16", "that well it's a payment mechanism i say", "74:19", "but that there this is one of the things", "74:23", "there's a lot of hand-wringing about in", "74:25", "the cryptocurrency world now is gambling", "74:27", "no just the fact that there aren't that", "74:29", "many big consumer facing uses of", "74:33", "cryptocurrency I mean I mean everyone", "74:36", "would everyone would like there to be", "74:37", "that was the idea and this is one of the", "74:40", "things we're aiming at with our", "74:41", "singularity net project is to you know", "74:44", "we by putting a I on the blockchain in a", "74:49", "highly effective way and then we're also", "74:53", "we have these two tiers so we", "74:55", "of the singularity net foundation which", "74:58", "is is creating this open-source", "74:59", "decentralized platform in which a eyes", "75:02", "can talk to other AIS and you know like", "75:05", "ants in a colony grouped together from", "75:07", "smarter and smarter AI then we're", "75:09", "spinning off a company called the", "75:11", "singularity studio which will use this", "75:14", "decentralized platform to help big", "75:16", "companies integrate AI into their", "75:18", "operations so with the singularity", "75:21", "studio company we want to get all these", "75:23", "big companies using the AI tools in the", "75:27", "singularity net platform and then we", "75:29", "want to drive you know massive usage of", "75:32", "blockchain and the singularity in that", "75:34", "that that way so that's if we're", "75:37", "successful with what we're doing this", "75:39", "will be you know within a year from now", "75:42", "or something by far the biggest usage of", "75:45", "blockchain outside of financial exchange", "75:48", "is our use of blockchain within singular", "75:51", "unit for AI basically for customers to", "75:54", "get the AI services that they need for", "75:57", "their businesses and then for a eyes to", "76:00", "transact with other AI is paying other", "76:02", "AIS for doing services for them because", "76:04", "this this this I think is is a path", "76:07", "forward it's like a society and economy", "76:09", "of minds it's not like one monolithic AI", "76:12", "it's a whole bunch of AI is carried by", "76:15", "different people all over the world with", "76:17", "not only are in the marketplace", "76:18", "providing services to customers but each", "76:21", "AI is asking questions of each other and", "76:23", "then raiding each other of how good they", "76:26", "are sending data to each other and", "76:27", "paying each other for their services so", "76:29", "this this like network of AIS can emerge", "76:33", "in intelligence on the whole network", "76:35", "level as well as they're being", "76:36", "intelligence in each each component and", "76:39", "is it also fascinating to you that this", "76:41", "is not dependent upon nation so this is", "76:43", "a world yeah that ever I think I think", "76:45", "that's going to be important once once", "76:48", "it starts to get a very high level of", "76:50", "intelligence again in the early stages", "76:52", "okay what would it hurt like if I had", "76:56", "you know my own database the central", "76:59", "record of everything like I'm I'm an", "77:01", "honest person I'm not gonna rip anyone", "77:02", "off", "77:03", "but once we start to make a transition", "77:07", "toward artificial general intelligence", "77:09", "in this global decentralized Network", "77:12", "which has component a eyes from every", "77:14", "country on the planet like at that point", "77:18", "once it's clear you're getting toward", "77:19", "AGI a lot of people want to step in and", "77:22", "control this thing you know by law by", "77:25", "military might by any means necessary", "77:27", "by that point the fact that you have", "77:29", "this open decentralized network under", "77:31", "underpinning everything like this gives", "77:33", "an amazing resilience to what you're", "77:35", "doing like who can shut down Linux who", "77:37", "can shut down Bitcoin nobody can write", "77:39", "you you want AI you want AI to be like", "77:42", "that you want to be a global you know", "77:44", "upsurge of creativity and a mutual", "77:48", "benefit from people all over the planet", "77:50", "which no powerful party can can shut", "77:53", "down even if they're afraid that it", "77:55", "threatens their hegemony it's very", "77:57", "interesting because in a lot of ways", "77:58", "that's a it's a very elegant solution to", "78:01", "what's an obvious problem yeah yeah just", "78:04", "as the Internet is an elegant solution", "78:06", "to what's in hindsight an obvious", "78:09", "problem right it's the distribution of", "78:11", "it yeah yeah yeah yeah but this is a", "78:14", "extra special to me because it if I was", "78:17", "a person brought in a country I would be", "78:19", "terrified of this shit I'd be like well", "78:21", "this is what's gonna that depends which", "78:23", "country if you're a person running the", "78:25", "u.s. or China you you would have a", "78:28", "different relationship than if you're a", "78:30", "person like I know the Prime Minister

fuck are we I mean", "92:49", "well that's a different question right I", "92:51", "mean I think what is your mind well I", "92:54", "think that there's two things that are", "92:56", "needed for let's say let's say human", "92:59", "body uploading okay", "93:01", "to simplify the body uploading there are", "93:04", "two things that are needed one thing is", "93:06", "a better computing

right but", "93:41", "that's where I'm getting this where I'm", "93:43", "getting at the inaccurate simulacrum is", "93:45", "get that's getting weird because the", "93:47", "biological variability of

an accurate copy of", "94:06", "games then the simulation hosting your", "94:09", "upload would need to have an accurate", "94:10", "simulation of the laws of bio physics", "94:14", "and chemistry that allow your body to", "94:17", "you know evolve from one second to the", "94:19", "next", "94:20", "my concern would change second-by-second", "94:24", "just like just like you do and it would",

it", "94:34", "would probably among some super God monk", "94:37", "living on the top of a mountain", "94:38", "somewhere in a year if it keeps good", "94:39", "with the problem but the point whatever", "94:41", "depends on what", "94:42", "the world it's living in true I mean if", "94:43", "it's living in the in a virtual virtual", "94:45", "world there'll be a virtual world if", "94:47",

you could upload into a Joe Rogan", "94:57", "living in the virtual world and then", "94:59", "just create your own fantasy universe or", "95:01", "you or you could 3d print and altering", "95:04",

"95:17", "thinking like my question is do do we", "95:20", "replicate flaws do we replicate", "95:23", "repression of course but we knew that", "95:26", "wouldn't we want to cure depression so", "95:28", "if we don't cure depression here's the", "95:30", "interesting thing okay once once we have", "95:33", "you in a digital form right then it's", "95:36", "very programmable so then right then we", "95:38", "dash up the dopamine the Saratoga then", "95:40", "you can change what you want and then", "95:42", "you have a whole different set of issues", "95:43", "right yeah because once you've changed", "95:47", "I mean suppose you make a fork of", "95:49", "yourself and then you manipulate it in a", "95:51", "certain way and you're then after a few", "95:54", "hours you're like well I don't I don't", "95:56", "much like this new Joe here", "96:00", "maybe we should roll back that change", "96:01", "but the new Joe is like well I like", "96:04", "myself very well thank you", "96:06", "so then yeah there's a lot of issues", "96:10", "that that will come up once we can write", "96:13", "modify and then the reprogram or so this", "96:16", "is the point that the ramifications of", "96:18", "these decisions are almost", "96:20", "insurmountable once once the ball gets", "96:22", "rolling", "96:23", "well the ramifications of the", "96:25", "ramifications of these decisions are", "96:27", "going to be very interesting to explore", "96:30", "yes you're super positive been super", "96:33", "positive of your optimism any bad things", "96:35", "will happen many good things will happen", "96:37", "that's a very that's a very easy", "96:38", "prediction to make okay I see what", "96:40", "you're saying", "96:41", "yeah I've just a one I mean I think", "96:43", "think about like world travel right like", "96:45", "hundreds of years ago most people didn't", "96:47", "travel more than a very short distance", "96:50", "from their home and you could say well", "96:52", "okay what if what if people could travel", "96:54", "all over the", "96:55", "right like what horrible things could", "96:57", "happen they would lose their culture", "96:58", "like they might go

good things can happen and", "97:10", "the ultimately the ramifications were", "97:13", "not foreseen by people 500 years ago", "97:15", "yeah I mean we're going into a lot of", "97:18", "new domains we can't see the details of", "97:21", "the plusses and minuses that are gonna", "97:23", "unfold it would behoove us to simply", "97:27", "become comfortable with radical", "97:28", "uncertainty

of course", "97:38", "barring any natural disaster yeah yeah I", "97:40", "mean of course Trump could start a", "97:42", "nuclear war and well and then we're", "97:44", "resetting to Ground Zero this

that", "112:15", "didn't work no he died before that so he", "112:18", "a chance to hear what his what his idea", "112:21", "was yeah you know I had some funny", "112:24", "interactions with some McKenna fanatic", "112:28", "2012 votes this was about 2007 or so", "112:33", "this guy came to Washington where I was", "112:37", "living then and he brought my friend", "112:39", "Hugo de garis another crazy a Irish", "112:41", "researcher with him and he's like the", "112:44", "singularity is gonna happen in 2012", "112:46", "concerns McKenna said so and we need to", "112:49", "be sure it's it's a good singularity so", "112:52", "you can't move to China then it will be", "112:54", "a bad singularity so we have so we have", "112:57", "to get the US government to give", "112:59", "billions of dollars to your research to", "113:01", "guarantee that the singularity in 2012", "113:05", "is a good singularity right so he he led", "113:08", "us around to meet with these generals", "113:10",

this that", "113:33", "this 2012 I he went back to his", "113:35", "apartment he made a mix of 50% vodka 50%", "113:41", "robitussin PM he like drank it down he's", "113:44", "like alright I'm gonna have my own", "113:46", "personal singularity right here and I", "113:50", "haven't talked to that guy since 2012", "113:52", "either to see what he thinks today about", "113:54", "the singularity not happening then but I", "113:57", "mean Terence Mckenna had a lot of", "113:58", "interesting ideas but I felt you know he", "114:02", "he mixed up this the symbolic with the", "114:06", "empirical

okay yeah I mean I know you", "114:51", "know his brother Dennis yes I know very", "114:52", "well yes so they yeah you brother thanks", "114:56", "at the time we've zero was a little bit", "114:58",

"115:29", "but but yeah I mean granted Terence", "115:34", "Mckenna", "115:35", "probably took more psychedelic drugs", "115:39", "than I would generally recommend was", "115:43", "speaking all the time and there's", "115:46", "something that I can attest you from", "115:48", "podcasting all the time sometimes you're", "115:50", "just talking you don't know what the", "115:51", "fuck you're

that", "116:36", "in a poetic sense rather than in a", "116:39", "literal sense and yeah I think it's very", "116:42", "interesting", "116:44", "to go back and forth between the you", "116:46", "know
