somebody", "27:14", "that's like wife's got died in a rape", "27:17", "and you go to his grave and just or her", "27:19", "grave and just start humping her grave", "27:20", "or something all that food you know if", "27:22", "there was such things as ghosts ghosts", "27:23", "would come out be like dude what the", "27:24", "fuck you know maybe they wouldn't want", "27:26", "to indulge you in your nonsense maybe", "27:27", "you would hit the wrong oh come on if", "27:29", "maybe look maybe it's not something that", "27:30", "can easily be tuned in maybe it's like", "27:32", "the Northern Lights

it's", "28:00", "not the state's nature it's just that", "28:02", "our understanding of natural law is", "28:04", "limited by our by our mental conception", "28:07", "by the type of science that we've", "28:08", "constructed and so on are you convinced", "28:10", "I mean what would you like when you look", "28:12", "at like the evidence of ghosts and what", "28:15", "not look at ghost shows if you look at", "28:17", "go shows wait wait what evidence do we", "28:20", "have any solid evidence ever that there", "28:21", "is a ghost or just speculation almost", "28:24", "entirely speculation there's no", "28:25", "scientific evidence well that doesn't", "28:27", "mean that they're not real because if", "28:28", "you think about what a ghost is if a", "28:30", "ghost is something that's not in this", "28:31", "dimension it sort of Flitz in and out of", "28:33", "it and how do you measure that I mean", "28:35", "science is the you know everybody says", "28:38", "well science says

measure like how much does", "28:48", "lead weigh you know what happens when a", "28:51", "star goes supernova observable things", "28:53", "when you get something like a ghost if a", "28:55", "ghost was real and it's an incredibly", "28:58", "rare phenomenon that depended on some", "29:00", "really exotic conditions how the fuck", "29:04", "you gonna measure I'm giving the offer", "29:05", "if there's any ghost listening they can", "29:07", "fucking rate me tonight and I could just", "29:10", "rape my ass all day long with those", "29:12", "dicks and if it happens I'll let you", "29:15",

off and I guess part of", "38:42", "what I would suggest to you is that you", "38:44", "know part of our opportunity right now", "38:45", "is to become co-creative with the", "38:48", "evolutionary

along all that stuff to", "39:44", "me is just bullshit as dodges that", "39:46", "basically is other ways that we're", "39:48", "avoiding taking full responsibility for", "39:50", "the planetary

know", "41:16", "as an amazing thing it's more like", "41:18", "reclaiming our human capacity and for me", "41:21", "that that's really where the knowledge", "41:23", "of the indigenous people is not you know", "41:26", "folktale it's not silly it's not", "41:28", "worthless it's actually something that", "41:30", "that you know those of us who care about", "41:32", "you know seeking to you know

do over the", "41:43", "last couple lot of my work but but now", "41:45", "in a different way is build bridges to", "41:48", "through the indigenous people and their", "41:49", "knowledge systems you
