says like okay write", "77:23", "this worksheet and do all this stuff", "77:24", "I've never done that in my whole life", "77:26", "and so write things down know what you", "77:29", "have like a list

these", "78:13", "problems that you have the things you're", "78:15", "afraid of this will help you then you", "78:17", "can tackle them this is smarter but I", "78:19", "didn't do that I still you know got to", "78:21", "where I needed to go but it's just dumb", "78:22", "to do it my way because you can just do", "78:25", "a little writing work and get to tackle", "78:29", "the stuff you need

too lazy to write stuff", "78:46", "down or they just don't do that and so", "78:48", "but I what I did is I said here are the", "78:50", "consequences if you do it my way like", "78:52", "it's gonna be slower and you know you", "78:54", "might not be as successful and this way", "78:56", "like it seems worthwhile like if I could", "78:58", "do this over again if I find a time", "79:01", "machine
