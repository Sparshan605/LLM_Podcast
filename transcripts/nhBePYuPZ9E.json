Shelf right you know you it was like", "03:20", "the the running joke at the agency at", "03:21", "the CIA was you know they we have a", "03:24", "fantastic S&T group science and", "03:26",

"03:39", "running joke is always that you know", "03:41", "they'll develop it they'll show it to", "03:43", "you before it operation but then they'll", "03:45", "put it back on the shelf because they", "03:46", "don't want that shit getting out there", "03:47", "right and people finding out that", "03:48", "they've got it so they'll give you like", "03:50", "a 20 year old piece of kit to use", "03:52", "instead and you'll be walking around", "03:54", "with like a phone the size of a brick", "03:55", "knowing that they've got something", "03:57", "high-speed on the shelf well that's what", "03:59", "everybody always thinks like when you", "04:01", "talk to the average Joe on the street", "04:02", "about technology in the government there", "04:05", "was like dude the stuff they have they", "04:06", "probably don't tell us about how much of", "04:08", "that is real yeah it's it's pretty real", "04:12", "have you seen some stuff that made you", "04:14", "go holy shit", "04:15", "yeah you can do that yes really yeah and", "04:18", "how much can you tell us well you know", "04:21", "what one thing that they're doing and", "04:23", "and there's a this is actually something", "04:24", "I wanted to talk about", "04:25", "today because it's gonna affect", "04:27", "everybody it's not just something that", "04:29", "it's gonna affect people in the military", "04:31", "or else in the intelligence community", "04:32", "but one of the things that they've been", "04:34", "working on is imagine you've got it", "04:37", "you got a rock up on it on a target and", "04:39", "your but your before you do that before", "04:41", "you you get the customers on site and", "04:43", "you're gonna you know hopefully obtain", "04:44", "some high-value targets there at that", "04:47", "location before you do you gotta you", "04:48", "talking like euphemisms oh I'm sorry to", "04:54", "another dimension but sometimes you know", "04:56", "okay actually I was gonna say sometimes", "04:58", "you want to actually capture them and", "05:00", "get their intelligence we've gone past", "05:01", "that right because the years where we", "05:03", "were getting our ass kicked for holding", "05:05", "on to people in detention facilities you", "05:07", "know what that did that that pretty much", "05:09", "convinced everybody that was involved in", "05:11", "this to just just whack them right", "05:12", "because then you don't have to deal with", "05:14", "the aftermath you don't have to worry", "05:15", "about are you gonna get in trouble for", "05:17", "interrogating somebody right exactly so", "05:19", "so that actually increased lethality of", "05:21", "operations you started painting targets", "05:23", "and just blowing the shit out of there", "05:24", "rather than trying to grab the target", "05:26", "and get their Intel that's a problem", "05:28", "because then the pipeline dries up for", "05:29", "the Intel but anyway so imagine you got", "05:32", "this you got this site the first thing", "05:34", "you got do is determine if your targets", "05:35", "there right and it's not like that you", "05:37", "know the Tom Clancy movies where you", "05:38", "know you're looking through walls and", "05:40", "all this shit it's you know that that", "05:42", "technology night-vision devices and and", "05:44", "and that ability and low-light", "05:46", "conditions to to monitor and to identify", "05:49", "specific individuals has always been a", "05:53", "problem they've made great strides on it", "05:55", "to the point now where in no light", "05:58", "conditions right with the with the right", "06:01", "stack database with the right", "06:02", "information and that database meaning", "06:04", "the right amount of information about", "06:06", "individuals right you just constantly", "06:08", "populating this database with new faces", "06:10", "or with new photographs of individuals", "06:12", "that you're going after with enough for", "06:15", "that to sift through they're getting to", "06:17", "the point now with no like conditions", "06:19", "that they can identify positively the", "06:23", "targets in that room or the targets in", "06:24", "that facility or in that building", "06:26", "whatever it might be and that's pretty", "06:28", "incredible", "06:29", "I rather they can identify people by", "06:30", "their heart rate mm-hmm with well not", "06:34", "just their heart right but I mean other", "06:35", "other bio data right I mean other but", "06:38", "they", "06:38", "and literally with video somehow or", "06:41", "another they can zoom in on you with", "06:44", "some scanner and recognize that this is", "06:47", "a particular individual because their", "06:49", "heart rate yeah this is there was an", "06:50", "article that was written about it and I", "06:51", "know that there's a company do you know", "06:54", "what hex is HECS it's some company", "06:58", "that's been used pretty extensively by", "07:01", "scuba diving community and now by the", "07:05", "hunting community as well because it", "07:07", "blocks the electrical signal hecs it", "07:10", "blocks the electrical signal that your", "07:12", "body gives off okay yeah that makes", "07:15", "sense", "07:15", "and I think they're doing work with the", "07:17", "military as well to develop suits that", "07:20", "will somehow another stop someone from", "07:22", "being able to recognize your particular", "07:25", "heart rate right they're just a lot of", "07:27", "work on what they call this or the", "07:29", "universe there's older depending on is", "07:30", "the leis that I got identified people", "07:32", "from a distance yeah it comes easier it", "07:35", "helps if you have other data points", "07:37", "right if you but this is all part of it", "07:40", "to some degree what you know they refer", "07:42", "to as a universal soldier right the the", "07:45", "the fighter of tomorrow and on Claude", "07:48", "Van Damme yeah but they got shit that's", "07:50", "right yeah", "07:51", "who doesn't remember Jean although he's", "07:53", "all in one room he's doing like chip", "07:55", "commercials now I'm sure you haven't", "07:57", "seen him in days or whatever dude seven", "08:00", "is true oh the splits yeah yeah I don't", "08:03", "know when that becomes useful though", "08:04", "really the splits I mean I've never", "08:07", "actually you know felt with that was", "08:09", "something I needed to accomplish in any", "08:11", "given moment from an operation", "08:13", "Ronnie movies where you have to do this", "08:14", "man", "08:16", "but so the Universal Soldier thing where", "08:18", "you you you're you know its exoskeleton", "08:23", "it's a soft suit it's all that data that", "08:25", "you can acquire for that warfighter how", "08:29", "do you create the perfect environment on", "08:31", "that individual as he's moving through", "08:33", "an environment to you know be a more", "08:36", "efficient effective lethal fighter and", "08:38", "you know things like that identifying", "08:40", "target whether it's with a laser whether", "08:42", "it's with low light or no light", "08:44", "conditions where you can you as you're", "08:46", "rocking up on the target you can do that", "08:48", "all these things you know the ability to", "08:50", "to carry more gear", "08:52", "humph it another extra you know ten", "08:55", "kilometers whatever it might be it's", "08:57", "it's pretty incredible what they're", "08:59", "doing and it's it's a joint it's not", "09:01", "just the military they're working with", "09:02", "you know companies like hax or they're", "09:05", "working with with the commercial sector", "09:07", "and academics too but anyway and I", "09:11", "disappear down a rabbit hole the these", "09:13", "like the the idea of like this Universal", "09:15", "Soldier thing if you've been paying", "09:17", "attention to this Elon Musk neural link", "09:19", "thing that he's coming out with you know", "09:21", "they're gonna somehow or another insert", "09:23", "fibers into your brain and then have a", "09:26", "Bluetooth enabled device that you wear", "09:28", "that it's gonna allow you to somehow or", "09:31", "another interface with data at a much", "09:33", "higher bandwidth I don't know what any", "09:36", "of those words mean I just said but that", "09:37", "was good though it was good it sounded", "09:39", "like you understood it that's my trick", "09:40", "and repeat words yeah I you know there", "09:44", "comes up warrant if you're talking about", "09:47", "I mean well that's that's going into a", "09:49", "different area that's going into", "09:50", "civilian applications and probably the", "09:53", "military application would be great for", "09:54", "that too everyone could synchronize data", "09:56", "you could give them navigation in their", "09:58", "head like if there's some sort of", "09:59", "augmented reality we could literally see", "10:01", "the targets in front of you like they if", "10:04", "you had a map say like that if the", "10:07", "Pentagon really does have this laser", "10:08", "beam they could identify specific", "10:09", "individuals and you have a map of a", "10:11", "building that's in your head and they", "10:14", "can identify the very location absolute", "10:17", "perfect location of each individual", "10:20", "person in that room and you could see", "10:21", "that as you're running into this", "10:23", "building you're seeing like a 3d grid in", "10:26", "front of you and I know I mean you could", "10:27", "shoot them right through a fucking wall", "10:28", "right and there's but there does become", "10:31", "a problem then that becomes a problem of", "10:33", "information overload and when you get", "10:36", "into that situation right everything", "10:37", "starts to close down a little bit right", "10:39", "and and or and so you've got to start", "10:41", "pushing some of that away and and now", "10:44", "what you end up doing is you get the", "10:46", "off-site you know command center", "10:47", "relaying some of that information as", "10:50", "needed but that guy that's about to", "10:51", "breach that door you know he doesn't", "10:53", "want a lot of data points anymore now", "10:55", "having said that knowing where you know", "10:57", "knowing where the hostiles are the other", "10:59", "side of that door that is key", "11:00", "information that's not rocket science", "11:02", "but so there's a lot that's going on", "11:04", "there's also the ability to monitor", "11:05", "of the individual you know soldiers are", "11:07", "out there through the the gear that they", "11:10", "would then be wearing it's it's an it's", "11:12", "an incredible effort that has been going", "11:15", "on and so they answer your point a long", "11:17", "rambling answer yeah I've seen some", "11:19", "things that are pretty amazing", "11:20", "you can't talk about though no no some", "11:23", "of this some of this shit actually we'll", "11:25", "get into with the new show that's coming", "11:27", "up sometime in fall I don't have a", "11:28", "release date and again I'm prescribed", "11:30", "from talking about so I won't do that", "11:31", "because so some I pay attention some of", "11:34", "the things that you saw you'll be able", "11:36", "to talk about yes so how does the", "11:38", "government do that they just decide well", "11:39", "listen it's not a bad thing if you tell", "11:41", "people about this sometimes raised yeah", "11:43", "I mean well I think this there's an", "11:45", "element of some of it's not what you", "11:47", "would refer to as classified it's just", "11:49", "not readily available public information", "11:51", "and it's not out there in the domain", "11:53", "because people aren't aware of it are", "11:54", "searching for it some of it does I think", "11:57", "you're right some of it is look the", "11:58", "military wants to say at times look what", "12:01", "we're able to do we're doing this and", "12:03", "oftentimes it's because it's in a sort", "12:05", "of a private public cooperation and and", "12:09", "so that encourages other companies with", "12:12", "innovative technologies to step forward", "12:14", "and get involved in some of this and I", "12:17", "guess that opens up all sorts of other", "12:19", "you know some people are out there", "12:20", "saying well they shouldn't be working", "12:21", "with the military well you know well", "12:23", "that's a question that I had the this is", "12:25", "brings me to a point that I think is", "12:27", "kind of important where people always", "12:29", "talk about the military budget and how", "12:32", "high the military budget is and you know", "12:34", "we need to take some of that money and", "12:36", "put it in other places and you know", "12:37", "maybe some of that military money is not", "12:39", "being used to the best for the best good", "12:43", "of the human race or maybe maybe some of", "12:45", "it but in order to be able to develop", "12:47", "stuff that keeps people safer in order", "12:50", "to develop all the stuff that you're", "12:52", "talking about that could potentially", "12:54", "save the lives of soldiers and and even", "12:58", "innocent civilians because you're gonna", "13:00", "be able to target the correct people all", "13:02", "this stuff seems pretty critical right", "13:04", "right and it's also there's a you know", "13:07", "there's an upside if you want to get you", "13:09", "know moralistic about the whole thing to", "13:11", "developing advanced technology so you", "13:13", "can be more surgical right", "13:15", "the drone capability as an example gives", "13:17", "you a", "13:18", "much better understanding of your target", "13:20", "you can avoid the collateral damage you", "13:22", "know the deaths of civilians on-site", "13:24", "through the use of proper technology and", "13:27", "that creates that environment and so", "13:29", "it's a good thing and again", "13:30", "I mean look let CIA their S&T group over", "13:34", "the years the shit that they've", "13:35", "developed for operational purposes that", "13:38", "then made its way into the commercial", "13:40", "sector and planted fitted people what", "13:41", "battery technology anybody walking", "13:43", "around with a pacemaker or a", "13:45", "defibrillator", "13:45", "you know in part can thank the the", "13:47", "agency because what were they doing they", "13:49", "were they were working they continue to", "13:50", "work on battery technology shrinking", "13:52", "those batteries as a power source", "13:54", "what Ischl e operational purposes so you", "13:56", "could you know they put a transmitter", "13:59", "out some site you know and and you know", "14:02", "so what are you doing you're", "14:03", "eavesdropping on a hostile target or you", "14:06", "know gathering intelligence but then", "14:08", "that that effort all that work that was", "14:11", "done then that later on benefits the", "14:14", "general public a drone technology same", "14:16", "thing right I mean the agency was front", "14:18", "and center on developing drone", "14:19", "capability now what are you doing you're", "14:21", "doing that - you know for environmental", "14:23", "concerns you know for mining it's so", "14:27", "it's I'm a little concerned about drone", "14:29", "technology my old house that I used to", "14:30", "live at this motherfucker that lived", "14:32", "down the street from me to hover a drone", "14:34", "over my house and film he's like like I", "14:37", "know he's like looking at me like what", "14:39", "do you do me swimming you fucking weirdo", "14:41", "did you ever go over and talk to him no", "14:43", "no should have some drone over his house", "14:45", "yeah I was thinking of shooting it down", "14:48", "but it's hard to aim up you know you can", "14:52", "nowadays bow and arrow yeah you have a", "14:56", "good bow like see the way the way you", "15:00", "calculate accuracy with archery is you", "15:04", "you have a range finder and that range", "15:06", "finder has a built-in adjustments for", "15:09", "angle this angle compensation for up or", "15:12", "for down but I don't know if it has it", "15:13", "for straight up in the air like because", "15:15", "you got to think the way you you're", "15:16", "judging how much an arrow is gonna drop", "15:19", "over the course of the flight", "15:21", "right right same as a bonus - yeah yeah", "15:24", "yeah right yeah but with a bullet", "15:25", "obviously it's this less compensation", "15:27", "because it's pretty much faster but", "15:29", "there's a video that's hilarious of this", "15:32", "guy", "15:32", "I got tired of this block party in", "15:35", "Brazil so he loaded up a drone filled", "15:38", "with fireworks and he hovered it over", "15:42", "the block party and started launching", "15:44", "bottle rockets down on these guys that", "15:47", "are making too much noise oh that's", "15:49", "excellent though I mean if you think but", "15:51", "that sounds like something one of my", "15:51", "boys would do and and I'm sure they'll", "15:54", "be listening to us at some point so that", "15:55", "I'm did they they're going to do this", "15:57", "yeah scooter Sluggo and Mugsy butts when", "15:59", "you name Sluggo or Mugsy or scooter", "16:01", "guaranteed they're gonna do they're", "16:03", "gonna do something like that yeah yeah", "16:04", "dude it was that when your kid I didn't", "16:07", "know it didn't occur to me it didn't", "16:09", "occur to me although I wanted to get Moo", "16:10", "gene

creating these deep", "24:35", "fakes are working you know at such a", "24:38", "pace that they're getting ahead of that", "24:40", "so it's I mean it's fascinating they're", "24:43", "coming up with ways to try to counter it", "24:44", "but I guess the the biggest point is it", "24:46", "sounds like a public service", "24:47", "announcement as people need to be aware", "24:49", "of it and they need to be smart about", "24:52", "course they won't be everybody goes to", "24:54", "the internet and they lose their minds", "24:56", "and they believe whatever it is that", "24:57", "they read that agrees with their opinion", "24:58", "sure and there's no bothering of", "25:00", "checking you know whether anything is", "25:03", "actually legit anymore or not but if", "25:06", "that would be my one piece of advice", "25:08", "going into 2020 starting now pay", "25:12", "attention don't believe anything you see", "25:13", "until you prove it and that's part of", "25:14", "the problem too right see now if we stop", "25:16", "believing anything we see right but if I", "25:18", "was a skeptical person right if I was a", "25:21", "conspiracy minded individual I'd say but", "25:23", "you're not this guy who used to work for", "25:25", "the CIA is telling us not to believe the", "25:27", "news wait I see what you're saying what", "25:29", "I'm saying is setting us up okay well",

"25:43", "don't mean to say I don't mean to imply", "25:44", "I guess what I'm saying is trust but", "25:48", "verify", "25:48", "right when when when you're looking at a", "25:50", "video of a candidate or you're looking", "25:52", "at anything real shit on the internet", "25:53", "now just be aware of the capabilities", "25:56", "maybe that's a better way of putting all", "25:58", "of this because you're right you don't", "26:00", "want that part of the problem and one of", "26:01", "the things that Russia does and and", "26:03", "others who were involved in this whole", "26:04", "propaganda effort one of the things they", "26:07", "do want to do is undermine our", "26:08", "confidence obviously in media so you", "26:11", "know by me saying don't believe what you", "26:12", "see I'm kind of feeding into that so", "26:13", "you're right I shouldn't I shouldn't go", "26:15", "that route be aware of what the", "26:17", "capabilities are pay attention everybody", "26:19", "should just be a little bit smarter", "26:21", "about what they're doing that's all I'm", "26:23", "saying so and also what we're looking at", "26:25", "now is so much more powerful than what", "26:29", "we had three or four years ago three or", "26:31", "four years ago this technology was not", "26:33", "available for the consumer but now it is", "26:35", "well there was I mean you think about it", "26:37", "if you", "26:38", "not to get too deep but if you think", "26:40", "about the photography how long is", "26:43", "photography been around there have been", "26:44", "efforts to manipulate photography right", "26:46", "so so altering photographs has been", "26:48", "around almost as long as the the medium", "26:50", "itself go to Photoshop that kind of put", "26:57", "it all in the hands of the consumer you", "26:59", "know what you were talking about Face", "27:02", "Swap the new face app to age people yeah", "27:06", "all these things make it easier for", "27:08", "whoever's got a smartphone to try to do", "27:09", "this but what you really and that's a", "27:11", "problem as well but one of the things", "27:13", "that you really have to worry about is", "27:14", "again sort of the state actors like a", "27:16", "Russia I mean Russia was behind the", "27:18", "faces swamp thing well yeah and that's a", "27:21", "good thing right", "27:22", "there are Russian companies that are", "27:24", "pushing this technology out there and", "27:26", "what are they doing you know you every", "27:28", "time you do that it's recording data", "27:30", "about you well not only that you have to", "27:32", "give your name and your email right to", "27:35", "get that application and then they have", "27:38", "a photo of your face that correlates", "27:39", "with your name and your email so what", "27:41", "they've done is they've gathered up more", "27:43", "than 150 million emails and faces and", "27:47", "they have data on people yeah that is", "27:51", "that's pretty powerful stuff like if you", "27:53", "think about what Facebook is done right", "27:55", "what Facebook has made billions and", "27:57", "billions of dollars by essentially", "27:58", "mining data right that's what they're", "28:00", "about Google is the same thing they're", "28:02", "mining data well Russia managed to do", "28:05", "that with a hundred and fifty million", "28:06", "people in a very very short amount of", "28:08", "time just by making something cute oh", "28:10", "let's see what it looked like what I'm a", "28:11", "hundred right now what do you think", "28:13", "they're doing with that data they're", "28:14", "slicing and dicing this trying to", "28:16", "understand the American electorate oh", "28:17", "yeah they're gonna they're not gonna", "28:18", "stop doing what they did and they've", "28:20", "been doing this forever we talked about", "28:21", "this before they've been doing this", "28:22", "since 1940s right busy trying to keep", "28:25", "the u.s. out of World War two before", "28:27", "they broke up with the Nazis it was a it", "28:30", "was a serious breakup but when they were", "28:32", "still aligned they were busy paying off", "28:34", "journalists and buying trade unions and", "28:36", "all the rest of it so they're never", "28:38", "gonna stop what they do because it's", "28:40", "worked for them and it's just kind of in", "28:41", "their DNA why but it's not also what the", "28:43", "United States does as well there's got", "28:45", "to be some sort of counterintelligence", "28:47", "stuff that we do that is sort of shading", "28:51", "well", "28:52", "yeah yeah justify appreciate how about", "28:55", "that", "28:56", "I like that okay that's a good term yeah", "28:58", "of course there is and people always do", "28:59", "that people you know what I'm talking", "29:01", "about if I'm giving a talk about Chinese", "29:04", "government's constant theft of", "29:05", "intellectual property somebody", "29:08", "inevitably will come up afterwards and", "29:09", "they will kind of roll their eyes and go", "29:11", "well we do it it's not like it's just", "29:13", "them the u.s. is guilty of it too well", "29:15", "you damn well better hope we are right", "29:17", "because if we backed off and said you", "29:19", "know what just you know for the sake of", "29:21", "being of righteous individual we're not", "29:22", "going to do any of this shit you you", "29:25", "would have to be with willfully ignorant", "29:27", "and naive or just fucking stupid to", "29:29", "think that Russia China these other", "29:30", "actors out there are gonna stop also", "29:32", "right we're all gonna hold hands and", "29:34", "unicorns get them flying out of our ass", "29:35", "it's not gonna happen so yeah I mean I", "29:38", "guess the answer to that is always the", "29:40", "same which is yeah you better hope we do", "29:41", "it and we better hope we do it well yeah", "29:43", "but people are nervous about that right", "29:45", "like this is my point about the military", "29:47", "budget like if you just caught the", "29:48", "military entirely well we're are gonna", "29:50", "start speaking Chinese because some", "29:52", "shits gonna go down like you can't just", "29:54", "cut the military budget you just you", "29:56", "can't I mean just cut it out one no no", "30:00", "military at all we're gonna focus on", "30:02", "ourselves yeah yeah fucking luck with", "30:04", "that that doesn't work so the question", "30:05", "is like how much money should you spend", "30:07", "on the military how much money should", "30:08", "you spend on counterintelligence how", "30:10", "much money should you spend on", "30:12", "propaganda I mean there should be some", "30:14", "money spent on propaganda overseas right", "30:17", "right because we're trying to manipulate", "30:18", "them the way they're trying to", "30:19", "manipulate us the idea though is that", "30:21", "where America we're nice we're the good", "30:24", "guys we're doing it the right way", "30:26", "supposedly yeah well there is that right", "30:29", "there is that and there's and you know", "30:30", "what honestly I'll be honest with you i", "30:32", "I've always you know like maybe I'm", "30:35", "naive or whatever but that was always my", "30:36", "thought process and it's you know when", "30:38", "we're out there in the operational world", "30:39", "and you think you know what ok she's", "30:41", "doing this but we're doing it for the", "30:42", "right reason and people laugh at that or", "30:44", "whatever but you know this is my phone", "30:47", "so you go look at that see that wave", "30:50", "that's how I when I open up my phone the", "30:53", "flag waves at me

bit", "31:51", "less secure obviously I know a guy that", "31:54", "is a let's just say done some very", "31:57", "unusual journalism and he still has a", "32:01", "phone that you could take the

I don't I don't", "74:40", "do that I know you wanted to talk about", "74:42", "wah wah wah wah wah way which i think is", "74:44", "a really fascinating subject to me and a", "74:47", "lot of people that are tech inclined", "74:49", "because they are at the tip of the spear", "74:52", "when it comes to technological", "74:54", "innovation in the cellphone space yeah", "74:56", "and I know that they're doing that with", "74:57", "in regards to modems and a bunch of", "75:00", "other things as well but it appears at", "75:02", "least and a lot of companies are", "75:03", "exclusively using their 5g modems as 5g", "75:06", "rolls out oh yeah yeah but it appears", "75:08", "they're they are involved in some", "75:09", "serious shenanigans and they have deep", "75:11", "roots with the Chinese government they", "75:13", "do they claim they don't they claim look", "75:14", "were independent we would never do", "75:16", "whatever the Chinese authorities say", "75:17", "think about that sentence think about a", "75:19", "company with the global reach of Huawei", "75:22", "of that importance to the Chinese state", "75:25", "and think about them saying trying", "75:27", "say with a straight face we wouldn't we", "75:29", "wouldn't do you know things that the", "75:31", "Chinese government might ask us to do a", "75:34", "real Chinese company and you said that", "75:36", "you meant it they would exactly like you", "75:39", "won't yeah you would not be in business", "75:41", "for that long or there would be a change", "75:42", "in the senior management of the business", "75:45", "so and who always been caught out", "75:48", "they've been caught out in Europe to the", "75:52", "degree where at a certain point you", "75:54", "think Germany and others that are deeply", "75:58", "involved with Huawei now in terms of the", "76:00", "5g infrastructure where they've just", "76:02", "made this decision", "76:03", "look it's financially better for us to", "76:06", "work with Huawei and we can set aside", "76:08", "the security risks they're literally", "76:09", "made that decision yeah that was reading", "76:12", "an article about that very recently that", "76:14", "they've just decided to have some sort", "76:16", "of a risk to reward conversation and the", "76:21", "risk is worth the reward right right and", "76:23", "so you know that's that's their", "76:25", "calculation from a u.s. perspective", "76:27", "because we are you know because there's", "76:29", "two essentially two superpowers now", "76:32", "right I mean in China's you know", "76:34", "advancing and and we're not the lone", "76:37", "superpower on the stage anymore and so", "76:39", "we are the number one target and you", "76:43", "know our calculation has to be different", "76:45", "so we've been going at it and I know", "76:47", "everybody I think it's been it's been", "76:48", "pretty well covered it didn't used to be", "76:50", "covered very well but it's been pretty", "76:51", "well covered over the past couple of", "76:53", "months and now what's happening is we've", "76:55", "been in these trade negotiations with", "76:57", "China and I think unfortunately I think", "77:00", "the current administration the Trump", "77:02", "administration is going to blink and I", "77:04", "think there because Huawei is such a", "77:07", "huge issue for the Chinese and the idea", "77:09", "that we would prevent our companies from", "77:12", "selling into or purchasing from or", "77:14", "dealing with and that we would have", "77:17", "sanctions on other countries that that", "77:19", "do they view that as such a threat to", "77:22", "their own interests and their own future", "77:27", "that Huawei is front and center with any", "77:30", "trade deal so they're looking they're", "77:32", "not doing any trade deal unless we make", "77:33", "concessions on hallway and I have a", "77:35", "feeling that Trump administration is", "77:36", "going to make those concessions because", "77:37", "from a political perspective they want a", "77:39", "trade deal right", "77:40", "so far they've actually said to Google", "77:42", "that Google is gonna stop using the", "77:45", "Android operating system for the Chinese", "77:47", "phones for huawei's phones at least", "77:49", "they're going to not let them license", "77:51", "out the so Huawei's actually been at", "77:54", "least rumored to be in production of", "77:56", "their own operating system which would", "77:58", "mean they would have to have their own", "78:00", "not just operating system but they did", "78:02", "have to have their own eco systems and", "78:03", "they'd have to have an app store they'd", "78:05", "have to have all that all the jazz that", "78:07", "we have today when you if you sign up", "78:09", "for you buy an Android phone you have", "78:10", "access to the Google Play market which", "78:12", "is this huge resource of applications", "78:15", "and as soon as you take that away you've", "78:17", "got to kind of rebuild that whole thing", "78:19", "from scratch right right well I did", "78:21", "wai-wait doesn't lack anything in", "78:23", "resources you know they'll be fine", "78:25", "you know because it's either the state", "78:27", "will provide and ensure that they have", "78:28", "the resources they need they also you", "78:31", "know we're the outlier here right I mean", "78:33", "we've been working with New Zealand in", "78:34", "the Canada and and you know the UK to", "78:36", "some degree but the UK has been you know", "78:37", "they've been kind of pushing back a", "78:38", "little bit on this idea that we're gonna", "78:40", "isolate while we I don't think that's", "78:41", "gonna happen so they're using Huawei", "78:43", "devices to some degree yes they've been", "78:46", "slower to adopt and and and kind of mesh", "78:49", "their infrastructure with hallways for", "78:51", "people here for people don't know what", "78:53", "we're talking about could you please", "78:55", "just lay out what's the concern what do", "78:57", "they think that Huawei is doing Huawei", "79:01", "is essentially what's it did the way to", "79:07", "put this would be imagine a", "79:09", "communications network that spans the", "79:11", "globe and Huawei builds and provides", "79:18", "gear and certainly going into 5g they're", "79:21", "a leading provider and so and then", "79:23", "financially they they can offer", "79:25", "countries much better deals than than", "79:28", "other providers but they are an", "79:31", "intricate part of that communications", "79:33", "web so if you imagine that Huawei is a", "79:38", "state-sponsored entity and will respond", "79:41", "to Chinese authorities requests for", "79:44", "information or

"intelligence communications that that", "79:56", "all kind of go through at some point", "79:58", "this interconnected system that's the", "80:01", "problem because they are essentially", "80:03", "building backdoors into that system that", "80:06", "allow them to suck communications out of", "80:09", "that network and use it for their own", "80:11", "purposes it's a great intelligence tool",

"91:27", "lenses right or like something good but", "91:30", "can we get to the bottom of this I was", "91:33", "super interested in and I was trying to", "91:34", "tell us like what are they using about", "91:36", "this name there's a photographer I", "91:37", "follow that was promoting it and I was", "91:39", "like it just seems like they're using", "91:41", "the name is all but I couldn't tell it", "91:47", "you don't know they're not right I", "91:50", "couldn't tell but as a photographer I", "91:52", "couldn't I could like all you're using", "91:54", "is the name this isn't a better photo", "91:56", "it's not doesn't have the value at the", "91:58", "lichen well that's good they have some", "91:59", "pretty spectacular camera so Jamie I", "92:01", "mean there they had the very best ever", "92:03", "night-vision camera not night vision but", "92:06", "night sight like the ability to take", "92:08", "photographs at night and it looks like", "92:11", "pull-up huawei night photograph examples", "92:16", "because Google pixel 3 is the second", "92:18", "best one but at West one is supposedly", "92:21", "the Huawei that the zoom came out a", "92:22", "couple months ago people were saying", "92:24", "that that was bullshit which was that it", "92:26", "was like I had a super zoom technology", "92:27", "lens that people were someone what was", "92:30", "that's real but who said it's no way", "92:33", "that that's real photographers", "92:34", "photographers reviewers people that are", "92:36", "using the do this stuff and said but", "92:38", "they weren't using this though they were", "92:40", "just one thing has improved one thing", "92:42", "has been proven that Huawei has taken", "92:45", "some photographs and said they were", "92:46", "taking on a Huawei phone and they were", "92:48", "actually taken on a very high-end yeah a", "92:51", "very high-end camera oh also Huawei", "92:54", "posted some stuff on Instagram from", "92:57", "iPhones couple two got caught a couple", "93:00", "times doing that which is also quite", "93:02", "hilarious but yeah it's a it's a sneaky", "93:06", "business and if if that's how they're", "93:09", "going to do", "93:09", "they're gonna get in through the", "93:10", "backdoor and get information through", "93:12", "phones and modems and and it may not be", "93:14", "you know it's it may not be something", "93:16", "that they worry about now in terms of", "93:18", "access I mean people say well why do", "93:19", "they want the access now they just want", "93:21", "to know that they can I mean imagine a", "93:22", "conflict in the future where they have", "93:24", "that ability right either to real-time", "93:27", "monitor communications through this", "93:28", "network that they've been able to build", "93:30", "trapdoors into you know or to impact the", "93:34", "flow of communication more aggressively", "93:36", "more proactively to to do things it's", "93:39", "you know it's it's like it's like", "93:40", "mapping out our infrastructure right the", "93:43", "testing the probing that goes on of our", "93:45", "of our electrical grid it's an example I", "93:48", "mean that's just planning for the future", "93:50", "in the event that something bad is going", "93:52", "to happen if there's gonna be a conflict", "93:53", "you know they want to know as do we I", "93:56", "mean again to your point that you know", "93:58", "hopefully we're doing the same stuff and", "94:01", "so yeah it's something else interesting", "94:05", "when you talk about China though is and", "94:07", "and you think about okay what should we", "94:09", "be watching and we touched on Russia a", "94:11", "little bit is the alliance between", "94:13", "possible alliance between Russia and", "94:15", "China and it's an interesting dynamic", "94:18", "you know traditionally Russia trying to", "94:19", "have them been together they've always", "94:22", "been some areas of concern", "94:24", "you know distrust but there are signs", "94:30", "there are things happening that appear", "94:33", "as if China and Russia have made a", "94:34", "strategic decision to align themselves", "94:36", "closer and that would be because they've", "94:39", "made that determination that somehow", "94:40", "it's in their best interests of it you", "94:43", "know and not necessarily that it's going", "94:44", "to be that way for any long period of", "94:45", "time but right now in the current", "94:47", "environment you see Russia acting as if", "94:52", "what they want is a stronger alliance", "94:54", "military alliance and political alliance", "94:57", "economic alliance with China and it's", "95:00", "it's it's an interesting dynamic that we", "95:03", "need to be watching we need to be aware", "95:05", "of and part of that is you know people", "95:08", "again this this idea that you know there", "95:10", "was this Russia Trump collusion and", "95:13", "thinking okay well that's good except", "95:16", "our relations with Russia have been this", "95:18", "bad in a long time so maybe it's all a", "95:22", "very", "95:23", "clever mind game that they're playing", "95:24", "because they're closely aligned but I", "95:26", "don't think so so we've actually laid on", "95:31", "more significant sanctions on Russia", "95:33", "we've attacked them from an energy", "95:36", "perspective in terms of our ability to", "95:38", "create our independence you know", "95:40", "particularly from from natural gas that", "95:44", "is damage to Russia's abilities so I", "95:46", "think there's reasons why they're", "95:48", "gravitating towards China right now but", "95:50", "this idea that somehow Trump is super", "95:52", "friendly and is a useful idiot of Putin", "95:54", "it doesn't doesn't play out when you", "95:57", "look at the reality of the relationship", "95:58", "between the two countries that whole", "96:01", "Russian collusion thing is a very", "96:03", "confusing narrative because on one hand", "96:06", "you have the Democrats who are saying", "96:07", "without doubt there's Russian collusion", "96:09", "and then the other side you have the", "96:12", "Republicans and say the Mueller report", "96:15", "essentially exonerated Trump from being", "96:17", "a part of any sort of Russia inclusion I", "96:19", "don't think either one is totally", "96:21", "accurate I think there's a lot of like", "96:22", "weird gray yeah both narratives I I", "96:25", "think that the Democrat narrative is", "96:28", "easier to understand it just makes sense", "96:30", "from their perspective why was how he", "96:32", "wanted why wouldn't we push that to this", "96:35", "day they're just still amazed that they", "96:37", "lost and so there must be some grander", "96:40", "reason why because we just how clearly", "96:42", "we couldn't lose to this guy right so", "96:44", "and it was also a talking point much", "96:46", "less you know let's hit everybody with", "96:48", "the racist hammer it's a talking point", "96:49", "and it's worked for them over at least", "96:51", "the first couple of years on the on the", "96:55", "on the Republican side look the Russians", "96:59", "knew what they were doing right they", "97:02", "were fucking with the election on", "97:03", "several different levels it wasn't just", "97:05", "trolling through the internet it wasn't", "97:07", "you know just placing stories that they", "97:09", "could it wasn't just trying to film it", "97:10", "you know a divisive miss and discontent", "97:13", "it was also doing these little dangle", "97:15", "things you know or they're you know they", "97:16", "were looking to see a word I think in a", "97:17", "byte what are they gonna do you

right and", "103:40", "effort and resources but it's something", "103:42", "that has to be done doesn't mean you", "103:43", "shouldn't still do it but it is I mean", "103:47", "corruption in in a place like Mexico", "103:49", "right whether people just don't have any", "103:50", "faith in the institution's because", "103:53", "they've lived in this system for so long", "103:56", "where all the officials in their minds", "103:59", "anyway are corrupt the police are", "104:01", "corrupt the federales are corrupt you", "104:04", "know the Marines down in Mexico probably", "104:06", "the most

"that's it which is it's it's odd but", "104:15", "it's it's a", "104:16", "it's a large organization and they've", "104:18", "been able to kind of stay above the fray", "104:20", "to some degree which is interesting I", "104:22", "have no idea but it's it you know it's", "104:25", "been the perception and just for the", "104:27", "most part it's it's true when you work", "104:28", "down there often enough you do get that", "104:30", "impression but it's how do you get rid", "104:33", "of that endemic corruption in that", "104:35", "society and turn that public perception", "104:38", "around you know because that will impact", "104:42", "but look what happened you know previous", "104:44", "administration when they they seriously", "104:46", "went after the cartel members I remember", "104:48", "that spree of violence that they kicked", "104:49", "off it was in part because the Mexican", "104:53", "authorities were going after cartels in", "104:55", "a more serious manner right they", "104:56", "previously that they were managing the", "104:58", "problem so they said okay look let's", "104:59", "manage down the violence everybody and", "105:01", "we'll let you keep doing your business", "105:03", "it's gonna happen so you guys do your", "105:04", "business but just you know let's it's", "105:06", "keep sort of public order you know as", "105:09", "something that we want to demonstrate", "105:10", "that we're capable of and when you have", "105:12", "to when they went after the cartels in a", "105:14", "more serious manner that's when that", "105:16", "that real parse spree of violence kicked", "105:19", "off and you know there was more Headroom", "105:21", "so these you know these various members", "105:23", "were you know they were combating each", "105:25", "other and they were going after the", "105:27", "public they understood that they had to", "105:29", "you know basically wear down the public", "105:31", "which is what happened the public said", "105:32", "after a while they said fuck it we can't", "105:34", "deal with this the violence is too much", "105:35", "it's awful and so government you know", "105:38", "eventually we went back to managing the", "105:40", "problem drug trade didn't go away of", "105:42", "course they just went back to the old", "105:43", "ways of doing things so but the violence", "105:46", "is just so intense the public eventually", "105:48", "just that we can't know and and I think", "105:50", "the cartels knew that they understood", "105:52", "that right and so they were willing to", "105:54", "to do it well the most ridiculous aspect", "105:57", "was that Fast and the Furious deal where", "106:00", "they were literally selling drugs to the", "106:03", "cartels so they could track them and", "106:05", "those drugs were used to eventually kill", "106:07", "some US office right right yeah I mean", "106:09", "it was yeah yeah yeah conflating things", "106:16", "yeah those guns

things", "113:17", "right but the most recent thing that", "113:19", "they've done was they seized a British", "113:20", "flag tanker and they're still holding", "113:22", "the crew and that's sort of an example", "113:26", "of their I don't say they're desperate", "113:29", "right because they've got an ability I", "113:30", "think to withstand and their control", "113:32", "over the PAS",

next", "113:41", "move and I know people say well we", "113:44", "shouldn't have gotten out of the deal", "113:45", "and we shouldn't you know we shouldn't", "113:46", "have this issue anyway because you know", "113:48", "it's Trump's fault for getting out of", "113:49", "the deal but you know they again I don't", "113:54", "have a lot of confidence in in them", "113:56", "sticking to the terms

"114:23", "because yeah we didn't make it a", "114:25", "condition of the deal right so we", "114:27", "basically said sure we want verification", "114:29", "that you're following the agreements", "114:31", "they said we'll fuck you this is these", "114:33", "are the places that we agree to let you", "114:34", "look at that's that was that I don't", "114:36", "want to over simplify but that was the", "114:37", "terms of the deal and so we we any deal", "114:41", "that we do with them in the future needs", "114:42", "to be able to say no we want on a", "114:44", "percent verification as John Kerry said", "114:46", "that's what you want you want to be able", "114:47", "to verify so when we heard about it what", "114:49", "we're hearing in the news from the", "114:50", "people that are opposed to the deal is", "114:52", "that Trump broke this deal and he was", "114:55", "foolhardy to do so that Obama had put in", "114:57", "place this deal and the Trump had broke", "114:59", "it and it sort of leaves us in this", "115:01", "terrible quagmire right but what you're", "115:04", "saying is that the deal was terrible and", "115:06", "that it didn't really give us access to", "115:09",

"115:16", "you're", "115:17", "if the way that you judge the the value", "115:20", "of a deal and they this is what the", "115:22", "previous administration the Obama", "115:23", "administration did was to talk about how", "115:25", "you know it's important that we verify", "115:27", "and we've got verification well yeah", "115:29", "you've got verification of the sites", "115:30", "that the Iranians agreed to let us look", "115:32", "at that and so yeah it was a deal was it", "115:36", "a good deal know they wanted this they", "115:38", "wanted to sign this deal in the Iranians", "115:40", "knew it and so yeah I think that that", "115:46", "justified saying no we're gonna redraw", "115:49", "this and even the EU which has been", "115:50", "clinging to the the old agreement even", "115:53", "the EU says well yeah we we could", "115:55", "improve it we could make it better but", "115:57", "there's no if you just keep things as", "115:59", "they were there's no incentive for the", "116:01", "Iranian regime to to make any", "116:02", "concessions or improve it so the point", "116:05", "being is we're going we're trying to", "116:06", "force them back to the negotiating table", "116:08", "and again given that their self-interest", "116:11", "is to stay in power and and remain in", "116:14", "charge then you know if with the economy", "116:17", "and the condition that it's in currently", "116:19", "if it gets much worse and they feel as", "116:21", "if they're losing a grip on the", "116:22", "population then I suspect they will come", "116:25", "there then I kind of lash out that Iran", "116:27", "doesn't want it nobody wants a military", "116:28", "conflict we don't want it they don't", "116:29", "want it yeah yeah oh yeah can they close", "116:31", "the

we", "116:57", "got it right and just saying it we got a", "117:00", "deal for the sake of it because you had", "117:02", "partial verification doesn't give you", "117:04", "anything we've had partial verification", "117:06", "of their programs for decades and they", "117:09", "just keep advancing their program so do", "117:11", "you think this criticism of backing out", "117:13", "of the deal that

"117:44", "what happens is both sides we lose in", "117:49", "this one because the Democrats just sort", "117:52", "of blindly you know accuse him of", "117:54", "everything's bad right and no matter", "117:56", "what he's doing a matter what policy is", "117:57", "it's all bad right and so so that's not", "117:59", "what you want to be and on the", "118:00", "Republican side you know you
