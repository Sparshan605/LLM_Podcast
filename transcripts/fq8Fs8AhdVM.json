the the argument", "11:23", "against no gloves was that you'd cut", "11:26", "you'd cut people want yeah III agree", "11:29", "with that I mean that that skin getting", "11:31", "pinched between bone that's be you know", "11:33", "just get torn yeah really cut but do you", "11:37", "think that having wrapped up hands and", "11:40", "having padded gloves like is that an", "11:44", "unrealistic sort of thing because like", "11:47", "if you're if you're striking sit like if", "11:48", "you an ax dude we're just fighting right", "11:50", "you're just fighting like there's no", "11:51", "like hey

hand there's a lot of", "12:09", "things you have to think about yeah but", "12:11", "I guess as as if someone has done it and", "12:15", "trained to to try to knock someone out", "12:17", "but you're not thinking about you know", "12:20", "we're never throwing punches at your", "12:21", "skull right you know we're aiming for", "12:23", "these targets that are soft for sure so", "12:25", "like when you're in a street fight like", "12:27", "those things don't turn off right so so", "12:29", "as a fighter I know I'm that's not a", "12:31", "concern to me in a street fight", "12:32", "situation when you bring that up but I", "12:35", "know it can happen I mean it happened in", "12:37", "some of the early UFC's guys guys break", "12:39", "their hands on skulls that's what I'm", "12:40", "saying is it unrealistic to put gloves", "12:43", "on someone and tape their wrist up when", "12:44", "they don't give them any other advantage", "12:46", "for striking any other way you don't let", "12:48", "them cast up your ankles or do something", "12:50", "where you you know you protect your", "12:52", "shins and make it easier for you to kick", "12:54", "hard because if you had like some sort", "12:57", "of spandex thing with a like a shin pad", "13:00", "like like the same sort of thickness of", "13:04", "shin pad as you have on the knuckles you", "13:06", "would just be slamming into everything", "13:08", "yeah elbows arms who gives a fuck you", "13:11", "wouldn't worry about it just slamming in", "13:13", "there boom it would change the game it", "13:15", "would completely change the game but it", "13:16", "would slow it down a lot", "13:18", "or I mean in MMA fights now you look at", "13:21", "a punch gout for MMA fight versus a", "13:23", "boxing match", "13:23", "yeah of course they can only punch so-so", "13:26", "punch counts higher but your hands are", "13:29", "getting hurt", "13:30", "you know guys guys will lose fights", "13:32", "simply because they can't continue going", "13:34", "into the second round sometimes will", "13:35", "that be the case or will it change their", "13:37", "style it will definitely change the", "13:39", "style but without having the gloves and", "13:42", "hand wraps and and that stuff there", "13:43", "there is going to be those times when", "13:46", "it's still gonna be it's just gonna", "13:47", "minimum not minimize but bring the", "13:49", "number down you know it's not gonna stop", "13:51", "it though I agree I mean I think if I", "13:54", "wanted to look at it in terms of just", "13:56", "pure entertainment value", "13:57", "I'd say leave it the way it is yeah", "13:59", "absolutely changed downward elbows", "14:02", "change up 11 things like I like the", "14:05", "pride rules man yeah", "14:08", "including with the judging with the", "14:10", "pride was judging on fight judge the", "14:12", "whole fight I agree with that I like", "14:13", "that I agree with that and I think more", "14:17", "judges you know but I think that's a big", "14:20", "one I was talking about with out with", "14:21", "Pat Miletich the other day we're saying", "14:23", "like five judges or more you know yeah", "14:25", "yeah three yeah I agree I agree with", "14:28", "more judges you'll get a little more", "14:30", "diversity also though I think you got to", "14:33", "change change the the scoring criteria I", "14:36", "mean we are using a boxing criteria but", "14:38", "like like when you talk about wrestling", "14:40", "and when I see guys go oh he's going to", "14:42", "take down when a guy goes down he pops", "14:43", "right back up I'm like it's not a", "14:44", "takedown it's not two right you know so", "14:47", "so like why can't we implement some of", "14:50", "the things because we're taking aspects", "14:51", "of all these different styles of", "14:52", "fighting mm-hmm like the route the", "14:54", "scoring system and the values for things", "14:56", "should should come from that to some", "14:59", "degree yeah takedown with the immediate", "15:01", "stand-up like if someone takes you down", "15:03", "you're right back up that is not a whole", "15:04", "lot different than you blocking a kick", "15:06", "yeah you know just blocking a kick count", "15:08", "if you get your knee up and your elbow", "15:10", "you catch one right here are you", "15:11", "counting that as something that guys", "15:13", "yeah right no no not so you know who", "15:16", "does Greg Jackson he's a great coach I", "15:19", "don't he so he I think he does his", "15:22", "psychological thing

help", "31:57", "grappling cuz gloves definitely hurt", "32:00", "some submissions to get in the way a", "32:01", "rear naked choke it's one of the reasons", "32:04", "why George's submission over Bisping was", "32:07", "so impressive because he went this way", "32:09", "you know he way out deep back of the", "32:11", "hand to the back of the neck the real", "32:12", "way which you don't

day's", "55:36", "fight he had made weight and then after", "55:41", "making weight they had a workout that", "55:43", "they would do to put weight back on him", "55:46", "and one of the things that they would do", "55:48", "is really burn him out so they had him", "55:50", "he was in the gym I wish he was here I", "55:53", "could ask him exactly what this was", "55:55", "because I'm talking many years ago and", "55:57", "he goes through this really hard pad", "56:00", "workouts like I got that bam bam bam and", "56:03", "they were saying they wanted to pump", "56:05", "everything up full of

draining himself out big", "56:16", "time you know he was walking around", "56:18", "north of 200 pounds you know cutting", "56:20", "down to 170 and then after the weight", "56:23", "cut they would swell him back up again", "56:25", "so they got to put 30 pounds back on him", "56:28", "in 24 hours and that was one of the", "56:30", "methods that they used was exercise", "56:32", "followed by fuel I guess it kind of", "56:38", "makes sense right it also confuses me", "56:40", "which confused me too cuz I'm a dummy", "56:42", "and I was listening to him talking about", "56:43", "this oh

it's just better for", "90:26", "your feet you know I just think the same", "90:29", "thing when I was saying with gloves and", "90:31", "punching I just think it's unnatural", "90:33", "it's unnatural I have a bunch of shit", "90:35", "underneath your foot your foots not", "90:36", "designed for that yeah yeah all right", "90:42", "when you and you say that I start", "90:43", "thinking about um how people I design", "90:47", "and what people are designed for and", "90:48", "then thoughts and they go everywhere", "90:52", "sometimes my thoughts like run into", "90:53", "another hey that's a good idea like you", "90:55", "come together but when you say that I", "90:57", "start thinking about when you talk about", "91:00", "changing your DNA where we started with", "91:01", "the hookworm thing and your feet if you", "91:06", "take someone from an area that is where", "91:09", "they have to be agile for and you take", "91:11", "them to the place where you just have to",

does", "91:21", "um how does that child fare in that", "91:24", "environment as he's growing up does he", "91:26", "adapt not as fast as the people that", "91:29", "already have those traits but does he", "91:31", "adapt and be able to survive and then", "91:33", "can he go back to that to the agile", "91:36", "lifestyle and with and take some of that", "91:38", "strength depends on how big he gets you", "91:41", "know like if you were talking like", "91:42", "strongman strength those guys are not", "91:44", "known for their agility right they're", "91:46", "giant you know there's there's a", "91:47", "trade-off for sure there's a power", "91:49", "trade-off you know that's one of the", "91:51", "things that's so terrifying about", "91:53", "Francis and gah know is that he's 270",

you take what happens when a guy", "92:34", "like Francis in Ghana you develop his", "92:38", "wrestling so that it's like a Cain", "92:41", "Velasquez could you though at 33 like", "92:45", "that's that's the problem yeah like you", "92:47", "know and how much does the time does he", "92:49", "not like to wrestle cuz that was the", "92:51", "word that I had heard is that he wasn't", "92:53", "doing any groundwork it was very little", "92:55", "groundwork being done they were just", "92:57", "trying to keep the fight standing the", "92:59", "problem with that is you can't just do",

too", "94:59", "hard or do you think that that is just", "95:01", "the way you have to train if you I mean", "95:04", "if you won't look at world-class", "95:06", "fighters aka is one of the top gyms in", "95:08", "the world Luke Rockhold Daniel Cormier", "95:11", "Cain Velasquez Josh Thompson and you can", "95:14", "keep going down the road there's a ton", "95:16", "of like guys that people

are concerned it", "95:47", "has to do with the number of quality", "95:50", "guys that they have that are fighting at", "95:52", "the same time mm-hmm and only they're", "95:54", "only being so many hours in the day so", "95:56", "they're in the gym at the same time", "95:58", "having to do the work that they need to", "96:00", "do to prepare for a fight yeah but", "96:02", "they're all on the

in this rich area are", "113:02", "always better they always have the", "113:05", "better scores but then when you take", "113:07", "that same you take the same type of", "113:09", "effort and you put that somewhere in a", "113:11", "poor area their scores come up and and", "113:14", "they can compete right if they have the", "113:16", "same effort from the faculty and the", "113:18", "staff and

for the mathematics of the", "137:23", "fight like God Dustin Poirier and gage", "137:25", "he I love Dustin he's my boy right but I", "137:28", "don't like it because Dustin and Eddie", "137:31", "the fight with Dustin and Eddie the", "137:33", "fight was going one way there was a was", "137:36", "it called in no contest for a", "137:37", "disqualification I'm like that I", "137:40", "disagree with that I know I'm biased but", "137:43", "I feel like my argument is strong in", "137:45", "that the ref herb came back to the", "137:47", "locker rooms and he explained to us that", "137:49", "we're using the old rules mmm so if by", "137:53", "the old rules all three of those knees", "137:55", "were illegal right it doesn't matter if", "137:57", "it was intentional it matters if it's", "137:58", "illegal that's that's the way I", "138:00", "understand it right so that's so that's", "138:01", "my thing I so you feel like you should", "138:03", "be disqualified and should be a loss", "138:04", "right yeah coming I think that's a real", "138:07", "good argument it's a real good argument", "138:10", "and I don't think Eddie's a dirty", "138:12", "fighter no but I do think Dustin was", "138:15", "winning that fight up into those moments", "138:16", "yeah I agree he had heard Eddie and it", "138:19", "stunned him on several occasions the", "138:21", "Eddie came back and cracked him there", "138:23", "was a lot going on in that fight but", "138:24", "those those knees were they're supposed", "138:27", "to be a disqualification for something", "138:28", "like that right that's what the whole", "138:29", "idea is about doing something illegal", "138:31", "you do something illegal and the guy", "138:32", "gets really hurt from it yeah", "138:34", "that's illegal you weren't supposed to", "138:36", "do it it's a disqualification I think", "138:38", "he's in the heat of the moment you", "138:39", "probably didn't even know whether it was", "138:40", "legal or not legal is just trying to", "138:41", "land knees yeah who knows he's been", "138:43", "rocked you got to put that into", "138:46", "account as well he got hurt real bad", "138:49", "that I Dustin cracked him yeah yeah like", "138:53", "so mathematically would you like to see", "138:55", "the rematch", "138:55", "I would like to see the rematch um", "138:57", "definitely I mean Dustin was lobbying", "139:00", "for the rematch also and then on top of", "139:02", "that mathematically I feel like it", "139:05", "doesn't make sense because Eddie just", "139:06", "beat gay Chi right so like it's like", "139:10", "script porn this disqualification", "139:11", "happened and this one guy got to step up", "139:14", "the ladder right but you've now if you", "139:16", "want to step up the ladder you have to", "139:17", "do exactly what he did right that's a", "139:19", "good point yeah", "139:20", "that's a good point well that that", "139:22", "essentially is solidifying the position", "139:24", "as a no contest right because you're", "139:26", "making you think he should have won I", "139:28", "tend to agree with you and you think", "139:31", "that he should have a better position", "139:33", "yeah I think a rematch would be the way", "139:35", "to go but I still I see that fight as a", "139:39", "fight fan yeah Katie Poirier mmm-hmm", "139:43", "Kate she's an interesting guy", "139:45", "yeah tough motherfucker and he throws", "139:47", "leg kicks from like a foot away from you", "139:49", "he's like right on top of you and he he", "139:51", "swivels his
