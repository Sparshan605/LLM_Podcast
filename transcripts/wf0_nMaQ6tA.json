people", "08:50", "from other countries do you not want", "08:52", "things from other countries it was like", "08:53", "this made of it made in America thing", "08:55", "was like people disregarded it

keep things", "09:08", "exactly the way they are it's cheaper to", "09:11", "make it over there because they will", "09:14", "like what we saw with Foxconn where they", "09:17", "put Nets around the building to keep", "09:18", "people from jumping off and the weirdest", "09:20", "thing was people trying to argue that", "09:23", "the suicide rate at Foxconn was", "09:26", "essentially the same as

killed", "09:44", "themselves at work do you know rare it", "09:45", "is to kill yourself at work probably", "09:47", "pretty fucking rare you know how common", "09:49", "it is where you have to put

yourself they're", "09:57", "gonna get more creative yeah the problem", "10:00", "is we are all hooked up to this need for", "10:04", "cheaper products yeah profits when we", "10:07", "can't figure out how to innovate enough", "10:08", "to actually create the juice in our own", "10:10", "system and therefore we have to", "10:12", "rationally say I mean also we've gotten", "10:16", "into this idea of every year we have to", "10:17", "have a newer better piece of electronics", "10:19", "like if you gotta go the rest your life", "10:21", "with an iPhone 11 how much would you", "10:23",

weirdly breaks", "11:15", "down so it makes sense at the level of", "11:16", "the phone that you wouldn't want to do", "11:18", "that but weirdly in aggregate if you", "11:20", "can't start innovative if you can't", "11:22", "figure out how restart innovation in a", "11:24", "big way now you're stuck with either", "11:27", "having to live learn to live in", "11:28", "steady-state which none of us we", "11:30", "Americans have no program for living in", "11:32", "steady-state we need growth that was the", "11:35", "whole point of the embedded growth", "11:36", "obligation idea that it's a fused", "11:38", "throughout every institution every", "11:39", "pension plan assumes growth right right", "11:41", "all right so now we have this problem", "11:44", "where we don't have the growth and we", "11:47", "need the growth and then in a weird way", "11:49", "the planned obsolescence is like fake", "11:52", "growth it means that we're gonna rebuy", "11:54", "our phones even as if they were now", "11:57", "highly innovative so there's like a", "11:59", "weird way in which we become dependent", "12:01", "on nonsense you know", "12:04", "dependent on nonsense is a great way to", "12:06", "put it this is really highlighting that", "12:08", "for a lot of people when people are home", "12:10", "and they're with their families and", "12:11", "they're not travelling especially

represent they're represent their", "26:14", "actual opinions so what you're trying to", "26:16", "say so what you're saying to me Joe is", "26:18", "that I have absolutely no point in my", "26:19", "worth as human beings should never visit", "26:21", "your shows that were saying what you're", "26:23", "trying to say so what I am trying to say", "26:26", "is that in a generalized sense she was", "26:28", "just doing that same old same old yeah", "26:30", "and with with a person who is not", "26:32", "participating I sort of like in the it's", "26:36", "also that", "26:36", "these people that they would victimized", "26:39", "by putting them into these narratives", "26:41", "right that and they're accustomed to", "26:43", "using these patterns these people", "26:44", "traditionally did not have any other way", "26:48", "to respond right there was no internet", "26:50", "clips that were released a letter to the", "26:52", "editor well on page 25 yeah and maybe", "26:55", "they would print a retraction I mean", "26:59", "this is standard standard behavior for", "27:02", "some newspapers and some journalists", "27:03", "right", "27:04", "the unscrupulous ones unfortunately but", "27:06", "this this model doesn't work anymore", "27:09", "because anyone can go on YouTube and", "27:11", "instantly say my time on the Kathy", "27:14", "Newman show this is what went wrong and", "27:16", "this is why she did this and this is", "27:18", "what they told me in the green room and", "27:19", "this is what and then you lay it out", "27:21", "sort of sort of you know here's I mean", "27:24", "let's play with it maybe you're right", "27:25", "maybe you're wrong I don't know my take", "27:28", "on it is that the great thing about we", "27:34", "have we have an ability to do almost", "27:36", "anything we want on YouTube so long as", "27:38", "we don't get shut down let's say that", "27:39", "however you also have this concern that", "27:43", "as long as this world remains gated if", "27:49", "for example you have a closed world of", "27:51", "people who are pretending to have", "27:52", "conversations amongst themselves", "27:54", "discussing the issues and then you have", "27:56", "the institution say we're only going to", "27:57", "deal with the authoritative sources then", "28:00", "the problem is is that if you have a", "28:01", "state of pretend you know LARPing or", "28:04", "kayfabe whatever you want to call it", "28:06", "yeah it's taking place inside the gated", "28:08", "institutional narrative the institutions", "28:10", "are going to predicate their actions on", "28:12", "the official nonsense and whatever we do", "28:15", "on YouTube as long as there is an", "28:17", "insulating layer unless we can actually", "28:19", "lob something into the wall you know", "28:21", "over the walls of the Citadel they will", "28:23", "continue to actually act as if we'd", "28:26", "never said anything we never pointed it", "28:28", "out it's like you're at this kid's magic", "28:30", "show which the musician the magician is", "28:32", "completely incompetent and the lights", "28:33", "are on and you can see all the wires and", "28:35", "trapdoors and the magic show continues", "28:37", "to go on and so you may make the point", "28:39", "well everybody can see that it's", "28:41", "bullshit but as long as the institutions", "28:44", "agree to pretend that they believe the", "28:46", "bullshit we have a real problem than the", "28:48", "internet that didn't solve that it's", "28:50", "like", "28:50", "the internet might not have solved it", "28:52", "sorry to interrupt I think what it has", "28:54", "done is severely erode the foundation of", "28:57", "it to the point where the trust in it is", "29:00", "just there's no real mainstream anymore", "29:05", "like this idea that the mainstream news", "29:07", "is the mainstream well how is that real", "29:10", "if YouTube videos get more views like if", "29:13", "you if you make a YouTube video and it", "29:15", "gets 5 million views but then something", "29:17", "goes on MSNBC gets 500,000 views yeah", "29:21", "what's mainstream well what is", "29:22", "mainstream now we're talking about", "29:24", "instead of mainstream media I think the", "29:26", "term traditional media is the best way", "29:29", "the same way the term like legacy but", "29:32", "keep going legacies good okay", "29:33", "well look for the longest time people", "29:36", "had to use Morse code right and then", "29:39", "they figured out phones and as Morris", "29:40", "code guys were fucked right what did you", "29:43", "do what you know and then phones were", "29:45", "attached to cords yeah but I don't know", "29:48", "here is there's still phone no but", "29:50", "there's still a function unfortunately", "29:53", "to the so I love the point that you're", "29:55", "making I'm just trying to figure how to", "29:56", "play with it", "29:58", "let's assume if there is no mainstream", "30:00", "left what we're really talking about is", "30:02", "legacy institutional media yeah and the", "30:06", "great danger is that assume that the", "30:08", "mainstream completely exits the building", "30:10", "and it's only you know 10,000 people", "30:13", "trading bullshit amongst themselves but", "30:15", "they also control all the institutions", "30:17", "so like you the world gets to keep", "30:20", "reality mm-hm and we the institution's", "30:23", "agree to traffic in bullshit you can", "30:25", "make lots of jokes at our expense but", "30:27", "we're also going to be figuring out", "30:28", "whether work in a stock masks or what", "30:30", "our farming policy is or how the US", "30:34", "military should be deployed and where we", "30:37", "should send troops to protect oil fields", "30:39", "and all these kind of things and that's", "30:40", "what's concerning me is is that a lot of", "30:43", "us are settling for being right and", "30:45", "having them look like idiots and their", "30:47", "point is okay fine we'll continue on", "30:49", "we'll look like idiots but we also still", "30:50", "control the levers so with legacy media", "30:54", "your your assertion is that legacy media", "30:57", "has a much more impactful presence in", "31:01", "terms of foreign policy in terms of", "31:03", "dealing with", "31:05", "pandemic the response sings along those", "31:07", "lines let's play with it and see where", "31:09", "it goes okay if you think about", "31:10", "Wikipedia Wikipedia might have a rule", "31:12", "that says we allow we don't do original", "31:16", "research so please link to authoritative", "31:18", "sources and you say okay great what are", "31:21", "authoritative sources yeah so now the", "31:23", "authoritative source is the CDC or the", "31:26", "WH o or the Surgeon General or the New", "31:28", "York Times or CNN or MSNBC like if you", "31:32", "have this but is n MSNBC like if someone", "31:35", "just goes on on the air and let's have a", "31:38", "little something see is that an", "31:39", "authoritative source or wouldn't it be", "31:41", "like an expert in Hell to someone who's", "31:43", "gone over peer-reviewed studies someone", "31:46", "who is well who's the Surgeon General", "31:49", "right now I don't know CDC is that red", "31:52", "field I don't know I'm sure he's a", "31:54", "competent physician I also think that", "31:55", "there's a whole thing about pretending", "31:58", "that masks don't work masks don't work", "32:02", "in the general population please don't", "32:03", "buy them our health care people need", "32:05", "them there's our they're tiny", "32:06", "well that's what they've been saying", "32:07", "right and so the issue is that you have", "32:09", "some piece of nonsense so the the", "32:13", "original piece of nonsense because the", "32:14", "California is now changing their", "32:15", "recommendation and saying if you're", "32:17",

just", "137:41", "released the video today on our YouTube", "137:45", "channel and it's the video of you giving", "137:49", "this discussion yeah so it's introduced", "137:51", "by professor Marcus -

- a little drunk I", "138:03", "said okay what are you really working on", "138:04", "and I told him and the first it sounded", "138:08", "crazy and then he started thinking about", "138:09", "it and he asked me more questions and he", "138:13", "brought me over to Oxford he got me an", "138:14", "appointment had me talked to their", "138:15", "experts and then he decided that he", "138:17",

wasn't", "139:48", "a Shawn doesn't matter if it's not them", "139:51", "it's it's an entire system that believes", "139:53", "in peer-review it believes in its forced", "139:55", "citations you have

"140:24", "wrong about it about this theory that's", "140:26", "just fine", "140:28", "I'll find out that I'm wrong give me the", "140:30", "layman's version of the theory all right", "140:32", "first time never yeah do you know that", "140:37", "let's start off with Usher's drawing", "140:40", "hands mm-hmm", "140:41", "so do you Jamie do you have a picture", "140:43", "for that the key problem

into being the hands", "141:10", "holding pens using ink to draw each", "141:12", "other right that problem is akin to the", "141:16", "problem that we face in a fundamental", "141:18", "theory if you had the canvas how would", "141:21", "the canvas bring all of the richness", "141:23", "that you see around you into being and", "141:26", "what I did was I said okay we have to go", "141:29", "below Einstein so we have four degrees", "141:31", "of freedom but they're not yet space and", "141:33", "time", "141:33", "it's proto space-time but before and", "141:37", "then I said okay that those four degrees", "141:42", "of freedom are like the stands in a", "141:44", "stadium and the stands somehow need to", "141:47", "build the pitch and the pitch is a 14", "141:52", "dimensional space so if let's imagine", "141:56", "that you had okay we have got four", "142:01", "objects here right so the four degrees", "142:05", "of freedom correspond to the four", "142:06", "objects then we need a ruler to measure", "142:08", "how much of each of these four objects", "142:10", "we have so that would be four additional", "142:13", "variables and then you have angles", "142:15", "because length and angle is what", "142:16", "Einstein gave us in space-time so the", "142:18", "angles between any two objects are the", "142:20", "same as the reverse of the angle so then", "142:22", "you can count it up and there are six", "142:24", "angles to be had so there's four degrees", "142:26", "of freedom plus four rulers", "142:29", "plus six protractors which is 14 so", "142:33", "there's a 14 dimensional auxiliary space", "142:35", "and in my estimation you and I are in", "142:38", "some ways potentially having this", "142:40", "conversation in a 14 dimensional world", "142:42", "that we perceive back in the stands", "142:45", "rather than on the pitch as a", "142:48", "four-dimensional conversation that is", "142:49", "we're in a three-dimensional room going", "142:51", "forward in time so I've called this the", "142:54", "observers and the observers is two", "142:58", "spaces rather than Einsteins one space", "143:00", "stop you right there sure why 14", "143:03", "dimensions because I'm saying that the", "143:06", "fields that is the stuff is dancing not", "143:10", "mostly on the four dimensions that we", "143:13", "think we perceive but it's also dancing", "143:16", "on the rulers and the protractors so in", "143:19", "other words if I have XY and Z I need", "143:21", "rulers in the X direction in the Y", "143:22", "direction and the Z to measure things", "143:24",

"143:35", "space time is four degrees of freedom", "143:37", "plus rulers and protractors I'm saying", "143:41", "work over the space of all rulers and", "143:42", "all protractors as part of where these", "143:44", "particles and fields can dance", "143:47", "so the rulers and the protractors are", "143:50", "part of the system not just a choice of", "143:53", "particular rulers and

stands and the pitch there are", "144:34", "things that are happening in the stands", "144:35", "and there's things that are happening in", "144:37", "the pitch so you know when a guy is like", "144:39", "trying to make a free throw and", "144:40", "everybody's waving their giant noodles", "144:42", "trying to get him to miss there's an", "144:44", "interaction between what's happening in",

going", "144:56", "on here some fields are happening in the", "144:59", "stands some fields are happening on the", "145:01", "floor and there everything feels as if", "145:03", "it's happening in the stands because", "145:04", "that's where you're sitting in some", "145:06", "weird way then you've got this really", "145:08", "crazy stuff which I think one aspect of", "145:12", "it is everybody in theoretical physics", "145:15", "is looking to figure out whether there", "145:16", "are three or more generations that is", "145:19", "copies of matter everything in this room", "145:22", "is generational one it's all made up of", "145:24", "up quarks down quarks and electrons so", "145:27", "that up quarks and down quarks give you", "145:29", "protons and neutrons and electrons give", "145:31", "you a sort of interesting personality of", "145:33", "the various chemical elements they're", "145:35", "also neutrinos but they're streaming", "145:36", "through us I'm not going to count them", "145:38", "and that's all generation one of matter", "145:42", "so everything in that think of that is", "145:43", "like plastic Lego then there's another", "145:45", "Lego set made out of wood and then", "145:48", "there's another Lego set made out of", "145:50", "like lead you know and we don't see", "145:53", "those other two LEGO sets and except if", "145:55", "we're doing very energetic experiments", "145:57", "so there were three copies of matter", "146:00", "and everybody was trying to figure out", "146:01", "three or more and I thought maybe it's 2", "146:03", "or fewer and so one

good luck well cuz that", "174:59", "we're smaller that's true it is that too", "175:02", "but it's also a lot of what I do", "175:06", "requires me thinking on my own I have to", "175:09", "be by myself and spend a lot of time", "175:12", "staring off into space yep", "175:14", "yeah I in me too I but what I'm saying", "175:16", "is is that when it comes to people", "175:19", "following the story mm-hmm", "175:21", "artists and computer people are going to", "175:24", "help us push out aids - like can you", "175:30", "pull up Eric Weinstein org there's a", "175:34", "visualization that's
