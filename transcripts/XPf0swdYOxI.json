a request of people who play with", "79:20", "real like I hear all of this can we just", "79:22", "try that first because and I like to do", "79:25", "that when someone says that in return if", "79:28", "they if they're like sometimes you hear", "79:30", "everything all at once and that's how", "79:31", "that is a gift and you kind of don't", "79:33", "want to mess with that you want to at", "79:35", "least start from that point because if", "79:37", "someone does have an idea at least", "79:38", "they're starting from understanding", "79:41", "where this how this is and their other", "79:44", "idea if they have one is rooted in this", "79:46", "instead of being kind of arbitrary you", "79:48", "know does that make sense", "79:49", "mm-hmm and then", "79:50", "so but it's great to hear that and also", "79:53", "be asked to kind of be a soldier", "79:55", "sometimes sure I'll play because I'd", "80:00", "love to hear that", "80:01", "all these puzzle pieces together right", "80:02", "right but I also respect their their", "80:05", "idea their vision whatever it is you're", "80:07", "just trying to help them realize it yeah", "80:09", "sometimes sometimes it's like that and", "80:11", "sometimes I'm requesting that and", "80:13", "there's a way to communicate that that", "80:14", "sounds exciting", "80:15", "yeah and you should because it's a shame", "80:18", "to be misunderstood in that moment when", "80:20", "really what you're saying is oh my god I", "80:21", "have this idea can we try it just like", "80:23", "this for a start and once you're emerged", "80:26", "in this understanding your ideas to", "80:30", "better it will be based in understanding", "80:31", "this you guys are very unique and that", "80:34", "you don't sound like anybody else but", "80:35", "that's the point it is the point that", "80:37", "that in fact in fact I always look at", "80:39", "that like well that's the minimum", "80:41", "obligation right as to none it's to not", "80:44", "you know not sound like other folks yeah", "80:46", "the men without hats - what's the point", "80:51", "you already have everyone do I love that", "80:53", "song yeah it's great because it's sort", "80:55", "of a challenge yeah you can leave your", "80:57", "friends behind yeah you're like what the", "80:59", "fuck what why would it if they don't", "81:01", "dance they're no friends yeah like sort", "81:03", "of like drawing a dance line in the sand", "81:04", "you know it's a great song yes but I but", "81:09", "also there's there's that those are the", "81:11", "kind of two ends of the spectrum right", "81:12", "mm-hmm hearing hearing someone's", "81:15", "honestly and do an explaining yours", "81:17", "honestly and asking for help to just to", "81:20", "do that well your your stuff is not just", "81:22", "unique it's unique in itself like your", "81:26", "songs are different each song is", "81:28", "different than the other side is like", "81:29", "you don't there's not like a Queens of", "81:31", "the Stone Age sound well I think there's", "81:34", "a band called weand that I love so much", "81:36", "and early on my first band Caius that", "81:39", "was trying to sound like itself itself", "81:40", "but singularly mm-hmm and I was feeling", "81:44", "painted in a corner a little bit by the", "81:45", "fact that it had to be in this mode and", "81:48", "we toured with this band ween because", "81:50", "who would play anything do you you know", "81:53", "they aren't sure yeah I know they're so", "81:55", "brilliant and they play us mister would", "81:58", "you please help my pony and we were like", "82:01", "what the fuck is that about", "82:02", "and then they'd play riders on the", "82:04", "storm for 28 minutes when it was fucking", "82:07", "incredible they'd never sound checked it", "82:08", "you're like you just know and and what", "82:12", "they were was free mmm they set and then", "82:16", "they did a country record with all these", "82:17", "professional hired gun country you know", "82:19", "and it sounded incredible because they", "82:21", "were like cuz we can do that why can't", "82:23", "we yeah that manifesting what you love", "82:25", "period and so I just from being around", "82:30", "them and seeing things like that and", "82:32", "then starting this desert sessions", "82:33", "project which is what I just put out", "82:35", "recently where it's just collaboration", "82:37", "and it could be anything because it's", "82:39", "not all you you know but yet it's you", "82:42", "and so it was", "82:44", "that's how Queens started was like what", "82:46", "if you just played anything you thought", "82:48", "was good no matter what it was and you", "82:50", "let every song I had a friend of mine", "82:53", "once say to me you know not every song", "82:55", "can be your best and I and I just looked", "82:57", "at him and it was like why why what is", "83:03", "that why is that I don't even know why", "83:05", "that has to be a possibility why not", "83:07", "yeah what if you if you see through to", "83:10", "those spinning locks through to the", "83:12", "other side and a song could go there you", "83:15", "should take it there right I mean that's", "83:16", "what we're supposed to do yeah and it's", "83:18", "a weird pessimistic attitude isn't it", "83:20", "like not every song can be your best and", "83:22", "it was like oh I see you're talking", "83:23", "about are you talking about hearing", "83:25", "about yours yeah I see you mr. Howe went", "83:28", "before the internet like there was a lot", "83:30", "of bands that would put out like a few", "83:32", "hits on an album but then the rest the", "83:34", "album would almost feel like filler III", "83:36", "again that's another thing right it", "83:38", "seemed to me at one point in the my hope", "83:42", "was that okay in the spirit of trying to", "83:45", "do something different I call it on", "83:47", "supply on demand you know it's out there", "83:49", "cuz it's out there mmm-hmm what's not", "83:51", "out there that would be interesting to", "83:52", "hear it tell me what what you don't", "83:55", "think we need and let's start there", "83:57", "right for for just trying to fill in the", "84:01", "gaps and beautifully fill in the gaps of", "84:03", "what's not represented and and thereby", "84:06", "having this limitless ability to play", "84:08", "whatever you thought was right in the", "84:10", "moment as long as it was honest then", "84:11", "you'd be fine you know and uh and so", "84:15", "that's always been I just", "84:18", "I feel like it would be fun to try that", "84:20", "so that's why it's so jumps around", "84:23", "stylistically but I do think people", "84:26", "listen to whatever they think is good", "84:27", "and they don't care about genre what", "84:30", "unless you're a teenager when that's", "84:32", "important to you or that certainly was", "84:33", "to me um why is Jean R important that", "84:36", "seems like if you work at a record store", "84:37", "it's important because you're filing", "84:39", "these under like you
