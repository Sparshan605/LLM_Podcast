you get", "07:33", "this power vacuum and then it becomes", "07:35", "far worse we've tried every model we", "07:38", "tried invading Afghanistan taking over", "07:40", "we trying to rebuild the

have failed so", "08:00", "I think now you've got people I mean the", "08:01", "thing I always think most people would", "08:03", "say we should have intervened in Rwanda", "08:05", "I think almost everyone would say I mean", "08:08", "Bill Clinton would say that's his", "08:09", "biggest regret I think in this", "08:11", "presidency most people would say we", "08:12", "should have intervened in Rwanda", "08:13", "I think if Rwanda happened tomorrow", "08:15", "you'd have a lot of people here saying", "08:17", "it's not worth it we won't help we can't", "08:19", "make the situation better so why even", "08:21", "try well it's so hard when you look at", "08:26", "the rest of the world and you see these", "08:27", "horrific conditions and you see warlords", "08:30", "and power and you see

directly", "08:59", "supporting one side it almost seems like", "09:01", "what you were talking about but you know", "09:04", "far lesser extent the the feeling that", "09:07", "you get when you're in these war zones", "09:08", "it's almost so it's not real that you're", "09:10", "you're covering it through this this", "09:12", "lens so you're immune from it it almost", "09:14", "feels like we view the the massive", "09:18", "conflicts of the world that way they're", "09:20", "like we're watching it on television", "09:21", "we're seeing it on our phones or our", "09:23", "laptops it's not it's
