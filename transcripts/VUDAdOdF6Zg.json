"09:02", "like the late 90s early 2000s it was", "09:06", "essentially like an online sport like", "09:07", "someone would say something about you", "09:09", "and you go alright how do i attack this", "09:11", "and it was it was more fun than anything", "09:15", "and I I felt like there was very few", "09:18", "people relatively speaking involved in", "09:21", "discussion groups back then in terms of", "09:23", "like the mass amount of people that are", "09:25", "on social media now it's certainly like", "09:27", "everyone is in some form of so most", "09:30", "people are in some form of social

art", "09:40", "form of ritual insults yeah I can", "09:41", "Shakespeare and you know African", "09:43", "Americans snapping there when people", "09:45", "realize that this is a sport then you", "09:47", "know no one gets hurt it's just like you", "09:49", "know right like martial arts it's part", "09:52", "of the fun by the thing is that when it", "09:53", "goes out of control and it really does", "09:55", "attack people's reputations then you got", "09:57", "a problem we have a thing in comedy", "09:58", "called roast battle yeah hosting another", "10:01", "exactly and roast battle is this this", "10:04", "great show that they do at the Comedy", "10:07", "Store every Tuesday where comedians will", "10:10", "prepare insults against each other but", "10:14", "my friend Brian Moses

misunderstand it", "10:43", "there's that famous press roast where", "10:46", "Obama had some fun at the expense of", "10:49", "Donald Trump when he was still just a a", "10:52", "reality show and you could see famously", "10:54", "the camera zoomed in on Trump and he was", "10:57", "not amused", "10:58", "and no jokes his expense and there's a", "11:00", "theory that what are the reasons that he",

that we're moral animals to", "12:09", "the extent that we have reputations the", "12:12", "going back to Richard Dawkins his famous", "12:15", "book The Selfish Gene where he posed the", "12:17",

"there's reciprocity that is if I the", "12:38", "nice things that you did to me and I", "12:40", "feel compelled to to repay them and", "12:43", "conversely if you do something that", "12:46", "harms me and I threaten revenge then", "12:49", "people can kind of settle into", "12:50", "cooperation because we really are better", "12:52", "off if we extend favours to each other", "12:55", "that do a

possible", "13:46", "and so when you have an arena in which", "13:48", "the first of all you don't have", "13:50", "face-to-face contact so you don't have", "13:52", "the kind of evolved responses that we", "13:55", "have to to getting along", "13:57", "namely it's it's a big deal to insult", "14:02", "someone to their their if their face and", "14:03", "people do it but you got to do it very",
