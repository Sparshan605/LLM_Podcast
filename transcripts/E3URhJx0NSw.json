"04:07", "in fact that's the primary risk factor", "04:09", "for Diana's being old and then having", "04:11", "certain underlying health problems for", "04:13", "example in China those men over the

the", "04:36", "Chinese data but there are a series of", "04:38", "risk factors that we worry about that if", "04:40", "they overlay on this disease are going", "04:42", "to cause bad outcomes and we happen to", "04:45", "be right at Ground Zero for one of the", "04:46", "major ones here in this country that's", "04:48", "obesity we know that obesity is just", "04:51", "like smoking in terms of

and life-threatening cases", "05:12", "occur in our country because of a", "05:14", "different set of risk factors and we saw", "05:15", "in China now you mentioned that there's", "05:18", "some sort of incubation period before", "05:20", "people become sick they're still", "05:22", "contagious what is this incubation", "05:24", "period and how do we know about it when", "05:27", "we call something an incubation paper", "05:29", "talking about from the time you and I", "05:31", "got exposed meaning I was in a room", "05:33", "breathe in the air that somebody else", "05:35", "who was

that's what called incubation", "05:45", "period so that's when case numbers can", "05:48", "double or triple in every so many days", "05:50", "in this case is about four days so and", "05:52", "we actually have data there from people", "05:54", "who are exposed one time or one time", "05:56", "only and we know when they were exposed", "05:57", "where they were exposed and how soon do", "05:59", "they get sick afterwards so the", "06:01", "chauffeur in the car where that an", "06:02", "individual is sick or showing symptoms", "06:05", "then the show forgets that four days", "06:07", "later you know they were there one time", "06:09", "at one time long and if the chauffeur", "06:10", "does not show any symptoms he's still", "06:13", "contagious he can also be contagious too", "06:15", "or he and that's one of the things", "06:17", "that's challenging here is you and I", "06:18", "might get exposed to somebody who is", "06:20", "totally asymptomatic no symptoms that", "06:22", "virus that appear well that's not a very", "06:23", "strong virus but in fact when it infects", "06:25", "us it could kill us so we've seen cases", "06:28", "of fatal disease that were exposed to", "06:31", "people that had minor symptoms", "06:32", "themselves Wow", "06:34", "this is what's unfolding here and this", "06:37", "is where I think is such an important", "06:38", "you know I said why the timing is", "06:40", "important because you know Joe we really", "06:41", "got to get information out to the public", "06:42", "there is so much missing from", "06:44", "information right now and you know we're", "06:46", "gonna be this for a while this is not", "06:48", "gonna happen overnight I worry I keep", "06:50", "telling people we're handling this like", "06:52", "it's a corona blizzard you know two or", "06:54", "three days more Mattoon normal this is a", "06:56", "coronavirus winter and we're gonna have", "06:58", "the next three months or more six months", "07:01", "or more that are going to be like this", "07:03", "and you know so far this thing has been", "07:04", "unfolding exactly as we predicted it we", "07:07", "and our center put out a piece on", "07:09", "January 20th and said this is going to", "07:11", "spread worldwide have time people said I", "07:13", "had no it's just China we put out a", "07:15", "piece the first week of February and", "07:16", "said this is gonna pop probably the last", "07:18", "week of February first week of March", "07:19", "because what happens is it has what's", "07:21", "called an R nought or a doubling time of", "07:23", "these every four days so to to increase", "07:26", "is doubling every four days so if you go", "07:28", "from two to four to eight to sixteen it", "07:30", "takes a while to build up but when you", "07:32", "start going from five hundred to a", "07:33", "thousand to two thousand to four", "07:34", "thousand that's what we're seeing happen", "07:36", "in places like Italy we're beginning to", "07:39", "see it in some ways up in Seattle it's", "07:41", "what happened in China and you know when", "07:43", "people are confronted with that suddenly", "07:45", "this low risk phenomena that ever talks", "07:47", "about isn't so low anymore and that's we", "07:50", "need to prepare people for now what can", "07:52", "be done like what what can the average", "07:54", "person do I see people walking around", "07:56", "with masks on wearing gloves is that", "07:58", "nonsense", "07:59", "largely yes first of all let's step back", "08:03", "the primary mechanism for transmission", "08:05", "is just the respirator out it's just", "08:06", "breathing in studies in Germany which", "08:09", "just have been published literally in", "08:11", "the last 24 hours", "08:13", "they actually followed a group of people", "08:14", "who had been exposed to somebody at", "08:16", "automobile manufacturing plant and then", "08:19", "they had nine people that with this", "08:20", "exposure he said if you have any", "08:22", "symptoms at all contact us we want to", "08:23", "follow up with and they all agreed", "08:24", "well they got infected and so in the", "08:27", "very first hours just feeling bad sore", "08:29", "throat they went in and sampled the", "08:31", "throats their their saliva their nose", "08:34", "for virus they did blood they did stool", "08:36", "they did urine and they found that at", "08:39", "that very moment when they first got", "08:41", "sick they had incredibly high levels of", "08:43", "virus sometimes ten thousand times that", "08:44", "we saw with SARS in their throats", "08:46", "meaning they were infectious at that", "08:48", "point already they hadn't even had", "08:49", "symptoms yet of really any nature they", "08:51", "were coughing yet", "08:52", "and and that's where we're concerned", "08:55", "because that's the kind of transmission", "08:56", "it's you know I always have said trying", "08:58", "to stop influence Irish transmission", "09:00", "like try to stop the wind you know we've", "09:02", "never had anything successfully do that", "09:04", "other than vaccine and we don't have a", "09:06", "vaccine here so what's happening is that", "09:08", "people in public spaces are getting", "09:10", "infected and the way you need to address", "09:12", "that is unfortunately if you're older", "09:15", "over 55 you have some underlying health", "09:17", "problems which unfortunately a lot of", "09:19", "Americans do we have obesity then right", "09:22", "now you don't want to be in large public", "09:24", "spaces in trying to potentially get", "09:26", "infected so you can take care of that", "09:27", "part as far as what can public health do", "09:29", "we reckon we can talk about this we're", "09:31", "not gonna have a vaccine anytime soon", "09:33", "that's happy talk well we you know we", "09:36", "can close schools one of the big", "09:37", "challenges we have right now if we close", "09:39", "schools what do we accomplish in", "09:41", "influenza virus when you we close", "09:43", "schools and during outbreaks because it", "09:45", "turns out kids are get infected in", "09:47", "school and they're like little virus", "09:48", "reactors you know they come home and", "09:50", "they transmit it to mom and dad and", "09:52", "brothers and sisters and so we closed", "09:54", "school sometimes it's Christmas breaks", "09:56", "are always great for kind of putting the", "09:58", "dampening effect on flu in this case", "10:01", "kids are not getting sick very often at", "10:04", "all which is one of the really good news", "10:05", "features of this disease into China only", "10:07", "2.1 percent of the cases are under 8 19", "10:10", "years of age why is that you know we", "10:13", "don't completely know and and I'm going", "10:15", "to come back in a second because they're", "10:16", "getting infected it turns out one study", "10:18", "showed that they still get infected with", "10:20", "the virus but they don't get sick and we", "10:22", "have that happen there's a disease", "10:23", "called infectious hepatitis hepatitis A", "10:26", "where we have outbreaks and daycares and", "10:28", "the way we know I have an outbreak is", "10:30", "because it's transmitted through the", "10:31", "stool fecal-oral is mom and dad and the", "10:34", "daycare providers all get sick and the", "10:36", "kids don't symptoms we go in and test", "10:37", "the kids they're all positive so some", "10:39", "diseases will manifest my primary when", "10:42", "you're adult but not as a child this one", "10:44", "appears to be the same so do we close", "10:47", "schools or not if we're not really", "10:48", "spreading the disease because it turns", "10:50", "out that if we close schools we own a", "10:52", "recent study done showed that 38% of", "10:54", "nurses today in this country who are", "10:56", "working in the medical carrier have kids", "10:58", "to school and if suddenly we're closing", "11:01", "schools for two or three months who's", "11:02", "gonna take care of those kids one-fourth", "11:04", "of the American population has no", "11:06", "sick leave if we closed goals they don't", "11:08", "get paid if they have to stay home so", "11:09", "when you ask what can we do we have to", "11:11", "really be thoughtful about what we do", "11:13", "are we doing more harm than good by", "11:15", "closing schools for example even though", "11:16", "everybody will say oh we got to do", "11:17", "everything we can or do we just tell", "11:20", "people you know it's going to be", "11:21", "limiting your contact as much as you can", "11:23", "and that's really about what we can do", "11:25", "and limiting the contact is that really", "11:28", "gonna help it does because it's like", "11:30", "putting rods in a reaction if you if you", "11:32", "don't have as much close contact you can", "11:35", "you know not transmit as much if I'm if", "11:37", "I'm sitting in a room with a hundred", "11:39", "people and we're kind of sharing air the", "11:41", "transmission is remarkable right here", "11:43", "you off the coast of

"the idea was that the breathing in of", "16:00", "the very hot air 180 degree air for 20", "16:03", "minutes to kill some of the virus see if", "16:06", "that temperature of 180 degree air got", "16:08", "really into your lungs your lungs would", "16:10", "be fry it you'd be dead well how so so", "16:12", "so what happens is just from the time", "16:14", "you breathe it in and what you mix it", "16:15", "with the air there it's kind of like", "16:17", "taking a cup of hot water and putting it", "16:19", "into a bathtub of cold water and so what", "16:22", "happens by the time you get done it's", "16:23", "not that hot and so in this case your", "16:26", "lungs couldn't stand even hundred and", "16:28", "ten to 20 degree heat without causing", "16:30", "real severe damage and so it doesn't", "16:32", "kill the virus at all so it would the", "16:34", "virus and I would be like just in your", "16:36", "mouth or something like that even then", "16:38", "no no that's unfortunate because that", "16:44", "was those exciting I was reading that I", "16:46", "was like don't stop using the sonic it's", "16:48", "a good thing don't use for your skin and", "16:50", "everything else but yeah but it's not", "16:52", "going to help you with this one so how", "16:53", "does it cool the air down what's", "16:55", "happening in terms of your lungs right", "16:58", "yeah what you basically is some mixture", "17:00", "of you know when you breathe out you", "17:02", "don't breathe all the air out okay I", "17:03", "mean you that would you'd almost be dead", "17:06", "you couldn't do the tidal volume so what", "17:08", "happens is every breath well in other", "17:10", "words you have so much air in your lungs", "17:11", "already when you breathe out you breathe", "17:13", "just a little bit of it out and each", "17:14", "time you could bring more in out in and", "17:16", "out and so when this mixes in the hot", "17:19", "air like that or the very cold air you", "17:20", "know in Minnesota when you're 45 below", "17:22", "zero we have the same problem we don't", "17:24", "freeze our lungs okay you know when we", "17:26", "breathe then may feel cool and so it's", "17:28", "just there's so much in there that it", "17:29", "mixes with the other air and it", "17:31", "ultimately doesn't the temperature your", "17:33", "lungs don't change even if you're doing", "17:34", "like some crazy deep breathing exercises", "17:36", "where you slowly exhale all the air out", "17:38", "there's nothing left and then breathe it", "17:40", "all the way in I'm giving you my best", "17:43", "shot at it it's not gonna make much", "17:45", "difference sorry", "17:45", "I've always wanted", "17:46", "about like people that are in like", "17:48", "Alberta and it's like 50 degrees below", "17:50", "zero like how do they do that", "17:51", "yeah well we do it all the time as well", "17:54", "we don't anymore in Minnesota it's", "17:55", "getting warmer there every winter but", "17:56", "the problem right yeah we we surely know", "18:00", "what cold airs like well so much for", "18:02", "that myth myth number two well I don't", "18:05", "say myth I should say rumor was that", "18:07", "this was something from some sort of a", "18:10", "biological weapons thing that was linked", "18:13", "right because wuhan is some area what", "18:16", "part of China that they actually do work", "18:19", "on biological weapons and we've heard", "18:22", "that loud and clear and let me just give", "18:24", "a little bit background aboard in my", "18:26", "career back in the early 1990s I got", "18:29", "very involved and the whole area of bio", "18:31", "defense and bioterrorism", "18:33", "bio warfare it turned out I was involved", "18:36", "with helping to

disease that's exactly", "20:38", "I mean look you know we could not have", "20:40", "crafted a virus like this to do what", "20:43", "it's doing I mean we don't have the", "20:44", "creative

and regular and I were talking", "21:00", "about the potential for chronic wasting", "21:01", "disease to be a problem for humans you", "21:03", "know mother nature's doing it pretty", "21:04", "well in her own the chronic wasting one", "21:06", "really scares me because there's so many", "21:09", "people that have a vested interest in", "21:11", "dismissing it I had our good friend Doug", "21:14", "durin yep on the podcast with I don't", "21:16", "remember the gentleman that he brought", "21:18", "with it right Richard thank you Ryan", "21:19", "Richards who explain the science behind", "21:21", "it and there are so many people that are", "21:24", "dismissing this because either they", "21:26", "enjoyed deer hunting or they they want", "21:29", "captive servants to be something that", "21:31", "are still something that you could be", "21:34", "released on private property", "21:36", "most people grow and breed deer and then", "21:38", "sell them to ranchers who want deer and", "21:40", "their properties particularly large deer", "21:42", "and I mean guys that I have talked to", "21:47", "that are dismissing it I can see the", "21:50", "chain of events that they want it to be", "21:52", "not a concern but if you see what it's", "21:54", "doing to deer it's terrifying it's a", "21:56", "hundred percent fatal it the the DNA", "21:59", "exists on plants for years they leak it", "22:02", "out of their saliva they leave traces of", "22:04", "it everywhere and in Doug's area there's", "22:07", "some some near is somewhere near there", "22:09", "there's like 50% infection range right", "22:12", "I listen I think this is really a", "22:14", "significant challenge I was involved", "22:17", "back in the 1990s and into the 1980s", "22:22", "when Mad Cow first emerged in England", "22:25", "and at the time was asked to give an", "22:28", "assessment when this was all this bovine", "22:30", "spongiform encephalopathy another prion", "22:32", "so these prion sir what causes disease", "22:34", "and you know people want to dismiss it", "22:36", "that people weren't gonna get sick well", "22:37", "then we realize ten years later all", "22:38", "these human cases started to show up", "22:40", "that from those exposures ten years", "22:42", "before and it took a while before those", "22:45", "prions obviously changed in the cattle", "22:47", "to get to the point where they didn't", "22:48", "affect humans well the same thing is", "22:49", "happening with a deer if you look back", "22:51", "on the deer population that were", "22:54", "infected 30 years ago and you look at it", "22:56", "today the prions are constantly changing", "22:58", "they're mutating and they're they're new", "23:00", "strains and they're getting more", "23:02", "human-like all the time and one of the", "23:04", "things our Center is doing is we're", "23:05", "looking at working on that very issue of", "23:07", "trying to help people understand that", "23:09", "the studies that were done 15 or 20", "23:11", "years ago looking at how infectious", "23:12", "these might be for humans we're really", "23:14", "well done they were good but they had", "23:16", "different strains and over time these", "23:18", "strains are looking to be more more like", "23:20", "they could infect humans or they could", "23:22", "even infect cattle which would be", "23:24", "another huge challenge if that happened", "23:26", "and so I think your points a really good", "23:28", "one and we know today that they're", "23:29", "probably at least 17,000 deer that were", "23:33", "consumed in the past year that were", "23:36", "actually positive for this prion and", "23:38", "people went ahead native anyway so I", "23:40", "worry about that too that's terrifying", "23:42", "so these people have these prions in", "23:43", "their system now but then currently", "23:45", "they're not they're not making the jump", "23:47", "to cause what is it yacouba's", "23:50", "creutzfeldt-jakob disease which is what", "23:52", "yeah it's kind of a we don't know that", "23:54", "humans are getting infected one of the", "23:56", "challenges we don't have a test unless", "23:57", "you die and then that's the heck of a", "23:59", "way to have to get a test or something", "24:00", "okay so one of the challenges you don't", "24:02", "know this until you actually show up", "24:04", "with the signs and symptoms and so one", "24:07", "of the things that we're looking at", "24:08", "carefully is doing surveillance or", "24:10", "disease detection among people that", "24:12", "might present with this if it's going to", "24:14", "happen", "24:14", "I suspect the naturally occurring prion", "24:17", "related diseases lights", "24:18", "creutzfeldt-jakob disease you just", "24:20", "mentioned occurs typically in older", "24:21", "people over 70", "24:22", "if you sudden start seeing the 40 year", "24:24", "old or a 50 year old or 60", "24:25", "even with this disease then you got to", "24:27", "start thinking what else is going on and", "24:29", "so that'll help best detect it in cases", "24:31", "but then we've already failed you know", "24:33", "then we've had ten years worth of", "24:35", "transmission or more potentially before", "24:36", "we get the first human cases like we did", "24:38", "with Mad Cow and so our message has been", "24:40", "right now hunting is really important it", "24:42", "is a very important part of our society", "24:44", "frankly it's the way we managed your", "24:47", "herds thank God it's a huge economic", "24:49", "boon for running the kinds of DNR's as", "24:52", "such we have we balance the back as you", "24:54", "know from sportsman on these licenses", "24:56", "and so we don't want to stop hunting but", "25:00", "we've got to make sure that we and make", "25:02", "sure that people aren't getting infected", "25:03", "and one of the things that our group at", "25:05", "the university Minnesota is working on", "25:06", "is tests now they're almost like point", "25:08", "of detection tests so if you shoot an", "25:11", "animal could you know very quickly that", "25:13", "it's positive or not and then you'd know", "25:15", "not to process that animal yeah and", "25:17", "that's we need to get at well not only", "25:19", "that the the prions what's terrifying is", "25:21", "that how how invulnerable they are how", "25:25", "ridiculously vigorous they are when", "25:27", "Jacqueline you can boil them a thousand", "25:29", "degree temperature for hours and hours", "25:31", "and they're fine that's right when", "25:33", "they're when they're sanitizing medical", "25:35", "equipment that they've used on mad cow", "25:37", "patients or whether it's cows or humans", "25:40", "with these prions they've been able to", "25:42", "do it three times so try to sterilize", "25:46", "these things like the sterilization", "25:47", "process you wear the what is the", "25:48", "temperature that they do it for well", "25:50", "they do it both temperature and pressure", "25:52", "but it's in the hundreds and degrees and", "25:54", "it's under high pressure and I've", "25:55", "actually been involved with several", "25:56", "cases where these very equipment you're", "25:59", "talking about were accidentally used on", "26:01", "somebody hydro occupant disease and they", "26:03", "had to landfill it they couldn't they", "26:04", "couldn't even sterilize it if that's", "26:06", "what's insane like you can't kill these", "26:08", "things that's pretty hard that's why you", "26:11", "know we we want to make sure that if", "26:13", "you're eating deer cervus right now that", "26:15", "we have to make sure they're tested and", "26:17", "I think the other point you raised is a", "26:18", "good one we've been very concerned about", "26:20", "the movement of this disease by serving", "26:22", "farming yeah we've had far too many", "26:24", "examples and Doug has shared that with", "26:26", "you you know just the extent to which we", "26:29", "see if you know state by state by state", "26:31", "slowly getting you know picked off", "26:33", "because somebody moved a trophy deer", "26:35", "from state a to state B and", "26:37", "affected it got out or others got out of", "26:39", "the pens and then it affects locals ya", "26:42", "know has that made the jump to bison or", "26:44", "elk or any of those other animals yet", "26:46", "not yet it's several kinds of deer you", "26:50", "know but not not those mule deer so far", "26:53", "there has been some cases in the West", "26:55", "it's primarily whitetails right exactly", "26:57", "yeah and then there's been a deer in", "26:59", "Korea the type of drear there and and", "27:01", "one in the Scandinavian countries one", "27:05", "yeah I mean I mean different kinds of", "27:07", "deer types there yeah yeah so the one we", "27:09", "worry about right now is getting into", "27:12", "the caribou in northern Canada right now", "27:16", "the range of the deer that are infected", "27:17", "in the provinces of Canada is right", "27:20", "biting up next to caribou and of course", "27:23", "if you're not a hunter you would know", "27:24", "this but caribou obviously the herds are", "27:26", "remarkable unlike you know white tails", "27:28", "for that matter elk if you got it into", "27:30", "caribou the it would likely spread very", "27:32", "quickly and as you know the native", "27:33", "populations the caribou are key they're", "27:36", "key to their livelihood yeah so you", "27:38", "wouldn't want to see it get in the", "27:39", "caribou now I didn't even know that it", "27:42", "was in Canada what parts of Canada has", "27:44", "it been throughout a number of provinces", "27:47", "I think there's four provinces now it's", "27:49", "in its its in its skin spreading it's", "27:52", "the same phenomena that a combination of", "27:54", "deer movement with surveyed farming and", "27:57", "then once it's in an area it'll keep", "27:59", "migrating a bit and a bit as these", "28:01", "animals move somewhere but you know as", "28:03", "we know deer don't fly 4,000 miles every", "28:06", "season okay so it's not that kind of", "28:08", "movement if humans if we're gonna see a", "28:10", "big movement as humans are doing it as", "28:13", "our good friend Doug durin has been", "28:14", "doing all this work to try to alert", "28:17", "people about it and also they're putting", "28:19", "up these testing places where hunters", "28:22", "can bring it here and have the deer", "28:24", "tested how much of that is available to", "28:28", "people around the country though not", "28:30", "nearly enough and that's what we need to", "28:32", "work on is if you don't make it easy and", "28:34", "convenient as you know it's not going to", "28:36", "get done yeah and so we you know it's", "28:38", "hard enough to convince people if", "28:39", "there's really a problem because people", "28:40", "don't want to believe it even if they", "28:42", "know that there's you know CWD in deer", "28:45", "in the area and we have some like that", "28:46", "but I think the tide is changing more", "28:48", "and more people are sensitive to it they", "28:50", "have access to testing quickly but if", "28:52", "it's gonna take your month and have to", "28:54", "get the test back you know what it is", "28:55", "well well in some cases they get so busy", "28:58", "because you know unlike laboratory", "29:00", "testing for an entire year where I do", "29:02", "one twelfth and January one twelfth and", "29:04", "February of cetera cetera you know deer", "29:06", "season typically is very concentrated in", "29:09", "just a couple of weeks to a month in the", "29:11", "fall and so the problem is all the", "29:13", "animals come in at that time so your lab", "29:15", "capacity has to handle that huge surge", "29:17", "all at one time", "29:18", "and so somebody's it takes a while to", "29:19", "get it back so these hires just hope", "29:22", "they don't take a bite during that time", "29:25", "yeah and we hope that these prions don't", "29:28", "ultimately infect simple jump and but if", "29:31", "they do you know I worry what will", "29:33", "happen to deer hunting as we know it", "29:35", "because probably a lot of people will", "29:37", "you know not continue and we need that", "29:40", "desperately for herd management I mean", "29:41", "it's the way we do it well what they're", "29:43", "doing in Doug's area is they're they're", "29:45", "actively trying to eliminate a lot of", "29:49", "deer and try to lower drastically lower", "29:51", "the numbers particularly of bucks which", "29:53", "I guess they wander more yep they do", "29:55", "yeah yeah it's all really scary stuff", "29:58", "because if they do make the jump to", "30:00", "humans I mean it has made the jump to I", "30:02", "believe mice okay well what happened was", "30:04", "originally it didn't and so that was", "30:07", "some of the data that was used to", "30:08", "support it's not a problem right now", "30:10", "these what we call humanized mice or", "30:13", "mice that are basically much more like a", "30:16", "human we're now seeing that jump", "30:18", "occurring and these new strains see the", "30:19", "strains that again were around 20 years", "30:21", "ago or not the same ones today because", "30:23", "as these", "30:24", "prions continue to pass from animal to", "30:26", "animal to animal they go through these a", "30:27", "little minor mutations and they're", "30:30", "getting more more and more like what a", "30:32", "human transmissible prion might look", "30:35", "like so in these my studies now that are", "30:37", "really made to mimic a human we're", "30:39", "starting to see that jump yeah and folks", "30:41", "if you've never seen a deer with CWD you", "30:45", "should go and google it because it's", "30:46", "terrifying the idea that that could make", "30:48", "that jump to human beings and people", "30:50", "pouring saliva out of their mouths and", "30:52", "their whole body just wasted away to", "30:55", "skin and bones right that's what we're", "30:57", "looking at I mean that's why it's called", "30:58", "chronic wasting disease because the", "31:00", "animals literally waste away we actually", "31:03", "have a major resource and", "31:04", "on our website free of charge open and", "31:07", "it's all in chronic wasting disease so", "31:09", "people want to go there it's wlwt's

that well you know it has", "37:09", "to do with your immune response again we", "37:11", "think that what happened is when this", "37:13", "virus got into you it created we call a", "37:15",

"37:56", "and when that virus got in between those", "37:58", "two it started again that same kind of", "38:00", "cytokine storm now the thing that", "38:03", "concerns us about this what we saw in in", "38:05", "in 1918 I mentioned just three plus", "38:08", "percent this one could be as high as 2%", "38:11", "so it's somewhere between a really bad", "38:14", "flu here at 0.1% and it could be as high", "38:17", "up here you know getting closer to 1918", "38:20", "like and that's the numbers I just gave", "38:22", "you a few minutes ago from the American", "38:25", "Hospital Association of you know 480,000", "38:28", "deaths here in this country over the", "38:29", "next six to 12 months what can someone", "38:32", "do to shore up their immune system while", "38:35", "this is all going on well a couple", "38:38", "things first of all just being as", "38:41", "healthy as you can be you know wait wait", "38:42", "you know I'm I'm getting up there right", "38:45", "now or you know becomes more and more of", "38:46", "a challenge to stay you know in good", "38:48", "shape you know the more you can do to do", "38:50", "that something you know about you know", "38:53", "it's keeping and shaped is really", "38:54", "important a second thing is if you're on", "38:57", "medications like for blood high blood", "38:58", "pressure don't don't miss them take", "39:01", "those drugs because they're really", "39:02", "important even though they may not", "39:03", "appear simple you know you don't have", "39:05", "any symptoms of high blood pressure or", "39:07", "something like that and then I think", "39:08", "just you know getting sleep and eating a", "39:10", "healthy diet and that's about what we", "39:13", "can do today to help get you prepared", "39:15", "for this

"study has been studied and it's been", "39:46", "studied I mean a good example is you", "39:49", "know and I and I was one of those people", "39:51", "who thought boy this is a great thing", "39:52", "probiotics you know things turns out", "39:55", "that we've studied this with", "39:57", "the antibiotic resistance and does it", "39:58", "help your gut etcetera and it turns out", "40:00", "that the probiotic users were no", "40:02", "different than the non probiotic users", "40:04", "in terms of recovery from antibiotics no", "40:06", "and the issue of if you're gonna kind of", "40:09", "compete out the bad bug so by getting a", "40:11", "good healthy gut flora there you would", "40:14", "actually reduce the chance to picking up", "40:16", "a bad bug and it turned out there was no", "40:18", "difference the people how would they do", "40:19", "a study like that the only way I think", "40:21", "they would do a study like that", "40:22", "accurately is it in fact someone that is", "40:25", "the same person like you have the same", "40:27", "person with no probiotics yep and then", "40:30", "have them with probiotics what in in the", "40:33", "studies that have been done are very", "40:34", "close to that but what they did is they", "40:36", "use two different groups of people those", "40:37", "people used probiotics this group did", "40:39", "not right and then they looked at all", "40:40", "the illnesses and they got stool samples", "40:42", "and everybody and they got a sample this", "40:44", "is a group I don't have the numbers in", "40:46", "front of you they're pretty sizable", "40:48", "because I was disappointed I mean I was", "40:50", "thinking saw myself yeah yeah so I mean", "40:53", "I think though but I think the key", "40:54", "message here is is that you know we're", "40:57", "gonna get through this but right now we", "40:59", "do have some real challenges before us", "41:00", "what we can't tell people as it's all", "41:02", "safe you know I I every time I hear", "41:05", "people say the risk is law right now it", "41:07", "reminds me of what would happen if the", "41:09", "there was this huge low pressure system", "41:11", "you know five days off the coast at the", "41:13", "Gulf and there was ninety degree water", "41:15", "between that system and the beach and", "41:18", "there was no wind shear the northern", "41:20", "hemisphere wasn't likely gonna knock it", "41:21", "off but we tell the people standing at", "41:23", "the beach that day we have low risk of", "41:24", "anything well you know five days from", "41:26", "now it's coming right and so what we", "41:28", "need to do has helped us American", "41:30", "population or the world for that matter", "41:31", "understand we're gonna be in some hurt", "41:33", "for the next few months and we have got", "41:35", "to get better prepared how we gonna how", "41:38", "are we gonna work where we gonna work we", "41:40", "can't stop working we need when you ease", "41:42", "on lights on we need health I need food", "41:44", "so the a bunch of things people should", "41:47", "do that's gonna boost their immune", "41:48", "system that we know of right like get", "41:50", "sleep", "41:52", "drastically lower your alcohol intake", "41:54", "drink a lot of water uh-huh take", "41:57", "vitamins those kind of things things", "41:58", "that are gonna keep your body healthy", "42:00", "yep that's you nailed so it's not since", "42:03", "sauna will help you a little bit because", "42:05", "it does what relaxes you relaxes you it", "42:08", "also boosts up your heat shock protein", "42:10", "now if you're in Minnesota we'd say", "42:12", "there's a two-part requirement that you", "42:13", "got to go from the sonnet to the ice", "42:15", "water there's a sign yeah he had to do a", "42:17", "boat yeah people love that right we do", "42:19", "it all the time well the Russians", "42:20", "invented that yeah yeah yeah does that", "42:25", "have you ever done that I have my son", "42:27", "has a daughter have a beautiful Lake", "42:30", "place open northern Wisconsin they got a", "42:31", "son and like literally 12 feet from the", "42:34", "lake and there's a spring right there so", "42:36", "in the wintertime the lake actually", "42:38", "stays open so we go right from the Sun", "42:41", "and the hot tub right to the water and", "42:43", "back oh wow even when it's frozen", "42:45", "oh yeah it's well because it's not", "42:46", "frozen right through the spring yes so", "42:48", "you literally can go right into it so", "42:49", "and then you run right back into the hot", "42:51", "tub that's when you sleep well when", "42:53", "you've done a couple of those rounds you", "42:54", "sleep really well yeah yeah I would", "42:57", "imagine your body's freaking out yeah I", "43:00", "love the sauna but I haven't had any", "43:01", "opportunity to jump into a lake right", "43:03", "afterwards okay well we'll have to know", "43:05", "it just not anyway yet have a nice", "43:06", "covered yes really yeah that's the real", "43:10", "feeling yeah well what else can people", "43:14", "do in terms of all this hand sanitizer", "43:17", "jazz and masks is that all yeah", "43:20", "the hand sanitizers actually are a great", "43:23", "thing for stopping a lot of infectious", "43:25", "diseases they actually are really good", "43:27", "they're good for your hands you know in", "43:29", "terms of the skin they kill the bad bugs", "43:32", "but the whole issue of using your hands", "43:35", "touching your face at people all", "43:37", "concentrate on yes the data is actually", "43:39", "very weak that this what kind of virus", "43:41", "is gonna be transmitted that way so I", "43:42", "wouldn't tell you to stop using hand", "43:43", "sanitizers but don't think it's gonna", "43:45", "have a big impact on this book do you", "43:46", "see that viral video that's going around", "43:48", "that woman who was giving the address at", "43:51", "the behest of the White House and she", "43:53", "see that she tells people not to touch", "43:55", "their face and then immediately licks", "43:57", "her finger and I did saw page yeah I saw", "43:59", "that I saw that well why is she telling", "44:01", "people not to touch their face because", "44:02", "you know well the the thought was is", "44:04", "that there are receptors around your eye", "44:06", "right here that actually for this virus", "44:09", "could get in and then get into your body", "44:11", "and you know the data we have on this is", "44:14", "so sparse to say that that's the case I", "44:16", "think the primary thing about", "44:18", "hand-washing is legitimate but one of", "44:20", "the things we want people want to do", "44:22", "something they want to be able to fact", "44:23", "they're doing so", "44:24", "and so we tell them wash your hands", "44:26", "often in to present this to prevent this", "44:28", "disease and I feel like we're not being", "44:31", "really honest with the people that the", "44:32", "data and and we've looked at this very", "44:34", "carefully really is about just breathing", "44:36", "air and that's a hard thing to stop so", "44:38", "keep doing the hand-washing but don't", "44:40", "think that that's going to stop this", "44:42", "disease which you asked about the man to", "44:44", "stop other stuff yes yeah asks there's", "44:46", "two kinds right basically the surgical", "44:48", "mask which just fits over and the reason", "44:50", "it's called a surgical mask is because", "44:52", "it's loose-fitting just fits you know", "44:54", "kind of ties behind you because weren't", "44:56", "worn by surgeons so that they don't", "44:58", "cough or drip into your wound and it was", "45:02", "never made to protect you from bugs", "45:04", "coming in so those little spaces on the", "45:06", "sides that's not a problem if I'm", "45:08", "breathing into the cloth right in front", "45:10", "of my nose but in terms of the air", "45:12", "coming in on the side they're not", "45:14", "they're not effective at all so people", "45:16", "wear them they look like they're doing", "45:17", "something they're not now if you are", "45:19", "sick they may help a little bit from you", "45:22", "transmitting because if you cough then", "45:23", "you coffee right into that cloth and", "45:25", "it'll some little in bed in there or not", "45:27", "get out around the other one though is", "45:29", "called an in 95 respirator but for all", "45:31", "intents person looks like a mask it's", "45:33", "just tight face fitting it has the seal", "45:35", "but you know the nose etc that's an", "45:36", "apocalypse mask it could be I don't know", "45:39", "what those are but that could yes I'm", "45:41", "just saying that that's how I look at it", "45:43", "okay okay well they're actually we use", "45:44", "them all the time in health care all the", "45:46", "time and they use them in action about", "45:47", "90% of them are used in industry so", "45:49", "they're grinding things or asbestos etc", "45:53", "you know they don't breathe in all these", "45:54", "parts so if we have one of those that'll", "45:56", "do something they're very effective", "45:57", "they're very effective the problem is we", "45:59", "have a big shortage you know right now", "46:01", "we have hospitals that are down to just", "46:03", "a couple days worth of these masks those", "46:06", "respirators and it's because we don't", "46:08", "stockpile anything in this country you", "46:10", "know we don't have hospitals don't have", "46:12", "the money to do that", "46:13", "those Preppers right now are so excited", "46:15", "yeah all the Preppers across the guy I", "46:16", "knew it I knew the day would come", "46:18", "yeah well they are they are Ann teaches", "46:20", "and well you know but well this is", "46:22", "really important because how health care", "46:24", "workers go is how the country I think", "46:26", "we'll see we're going you know they've", "46:28", "been over 4,000 health care workers in", "46:30", "China who are infected many of them on", "46:32", "their job and a number of them died and", "46:36", "if in this country", "46:37", "we have a real challenge delivering", "46:39", "health care because we're overwhelmed", "46:41", "and then we have health care workers", "46:43", "picking up the infection like we talked", "46:45", "about the group in Milan and we don't", "46:48", "have the protection for them I really", "46:51", "believe that's when the public will say", "46:53", "oh wait a minute what's going on here", "46:54", "and and that's where I think the", "46:57", "challenge so we really have to protect", "46:58", "our healthcare workers they are the", "46:59", "frontline people and and the biggest", "47:02", "problem we have is a lot of these cases", "47:04", "need intensive care medicine which we", "47:06", "only have a limited

take a step back after when we can", "50:44", "start now but we're not going to fix it", "50:45", "now is to say what are the key things", "50:48", "that we should do vaccines you know if", "50:51", "we had been serious about this we might", "50:54", "very well have had a corona virus", "50:56", "vaccine that whether worked specifically", "50:58", "for this strain whether it worked for", "50:59",

the", "51:09", "flu where you know sometimes when they", "51:11", "come up with a few a flu vaccine it", "51:13", "doesn't necessarily address the current", "51:15", "strain yeah it could be and that's where", "51:18", "a corona virus family vaccine may not", "51:20", "match up right here now but it could and", "51:22", "and the flu one you've really hit an", "51:24", "important point there's one where you", "51:26", "know we do have an imperfect vaccine but", "51:29", "it still does a lot of good you know", "51:30", "fifty percent of the people are", "51:31", "protected that's heck a lot better than", "51:33", "zero yeah if we had a vaccine right now", "51:35", "that fifty percent of the people could", "51:36", "be protected against this virus man", "51:38", "think of all the lives we'd save so the", "51:41", "bottom line message is we can't wait and", "51:43", "tell the crisis to fix these things you", "51:45", "know what we spend about point zero zero", "51:47", "zero one percent of public health", "51:49", "compared to our Defense Department and", "51:51", "yet look how vulnerable the it's the", "51:53", "bugs it's not a war yeah it's not a", "51:55", "missile is bringing down the world", "51:57", "economy right now and it's a darn virus", "52:00", "yeah and so this is where I think that's", "52:02", "what I tried to say in my book was all", "52:04", "about that I went into what we needed to", "52:06", "do in fact I hate it when people come up", "52:08", "and say we're screwed you know my whole", "52:11", "bottom line is what are you gonna do", "52:12", "about it then and that's what I laid out", "52:14", "a whole plan in here like these vaccines", "52:16", "like the stockpiles of mass you know we", "52:20", "should have a plan in place already what", "52:22", "are we gonna do with our schools when", "52:23", "they close are we gonna really close", "52:24", "schools let's not try to make this on", "52:26", "the fly you know I just mentioned if we", "52:28", "close schools we're gonna really hurt", "52:30", "some people", "52:31", "and people may die in health care", "52:33", "facilities hospitals because we don't", "52:34", "have enough nurses or health care", "52:36", "workers why have to make that decision", "52:38", "all of a sudden we could have planned", "52:40", "for that a long time ago", "52:41", "and so I think hopefully this is a", "52:43", "wake-up call cos you know nobody I think", "52:44", "really believed this I got a tape you", "52:46", "know the market today as you know", "52:50", "on this particular day crashed badly and", "52:52", "you know I think that up until 10 days", "52:55", "ago the market didn't even think this", "52:57", "was a possibility they just if you look", "52:59", "at it was flying high on Friday I did a", "53:02", "briefing for over 400 major financial", "53:05", "investors around the world and you know", "53:08", "I you know how I'm talking to you right", "53:10", "now you

financially", "53:42", "how we gonna get through this you know", "53:43", "where are we gonna go with it no plans", "53:45", "again it's caught everybody by surprise", "53:47", "I mean you are the one of the few people", "53:50", "that wanted to deal with this issue you", "53:52", "know we set this up several weeks ago", "53:54", "yeah you guys saw it coming you know and", "53:56", "and I think that's where the country", "53:58", "hasn't seen it now they're getting it", "54:00", "well I'm paranoid well I seek the advice", "54:05", "of experts whenever possible and what", "54:07", "what I was seeing was that there was a", "54:09", "lot of weird misinformation and", "54:13", "conflicting information a lot of people", "54:15", "saying don't worry and a lot of people", "54:16", "that were terrified I'm like okay I got", "54:18", "to talk to an expert and luck yeah you", "54:20", "were willing to sit down with us and", "54:21", "help us out well you know and the other", "54:24", "thing I think that you know I maybe it's", "54:26", "a function of age but you know straight", "54:28", "talk is so important today you know you", "54:31", "know I'm so tired of having people say", "54:33", "to me oh if you tell them the stuff", "54:35", "they're gonna panic and I say well", "54:36", "what's panic have you seen anybody", "54:37", "rioting in the streets yet have you seen", "54:39", "cars turned over smash have you seen", "54:40", "people hurting themselves over this", "54:42", "issue they're concerned you know they", "54:44", "want legitimate information and so what", "54:46", "you need to do is just tell them the", "54:47", "truth and we have many experiences like", "54:49", "that a few years ago when I was at the", "54:51", "State Health Department Minnesota we had", "54:53", "a big outbreak of meningitis a type of", "54:55", "brain infection bacterial brain", "54:56", "infection a number of high school", "54:58", "students were very sick all of a sudden", "55:00", "in one day they were in a hospital in", "55:01", "this community of 20-some thousand", "55:04", "people were on edge and so we had a big", "55:06", "town meeting several thousand people", "55:09", "showed up and I addressed them and gave", "55:10", "me everything I knew about meningitis", "55:12", "what we're gonna do about it etc and", "55:13", "then towards the end of the talk I said", "55:16", "and I just need to let you know about", "55:17", "one on every seven cases of this dies", "55:19", "and people looking said why did you tell", "55:22", "of that and I said because they needed", "55:24", "to know it two days later one of them", "55:26", "died and you know what everybody in town", "55:29", "was terribly sad very emotional but they", "55:31", "we knew it we knew it you told it we", "55:34", "knew it right and then they got on with", "55:36", "dealing with it we vaccinated the whole", "55:38", "town 20,000 people who vaccinated one", "55:40", "weekend for this bacterial meningitis", "55:42", "but it was because they had faith in us", "55:45", "because we told them the truth and we", "55:47", "said what we know and what we didn't", "55:48", "know and so that's what we need to do", "55:49", "here we need to just have Straight Talk", "55:51", "don't tell him it's low risk that's like", "55:53", "the hurricane okay you know I would be", "55:55", "really bad at you if I thought you were", "55:56", "a hurricane forecaster and you knew this", "55:58", "was coming but you kept telling me oh", "56:00", "it's low-risk don't worry about it right", "56:02", "yeah once it hit yeah so that's what we", "56:05", "need to do today is just say this is", "56:06", "gonna be challenging and we're gonna get", "56:08", "through it though we are going to get", "56:09", "through it I hope this wakes people up", "56:11", "to the value of vaccines - there's so", "56:13", "many wackos out there to think that", "56:15", "vaccines are you know a scam or they're", "56:18", "dangerous or that's there's so many", "56:21", "people out there that won't vaccinate", "56:23", "their children I know and that's one you", "56:25", "know what are your best shows beater", "56:26", "hotels he's a dear friend of mine he's a", "56:28", "I do too he's a dear friend of mine as", "56:30", "you and you know he is one of the", "56:32", "champions out there on this very issue I", "56:34", "couldn't agree with you more I think", "56:35", "that's really an important point that", "56:37", "you know we got to get this idea these", "56:39", "vaccines can be life-saving if we had", "56:41", "one right now think how different the", "56:43", "situation being we're in right now it", "56:45", "would be radically different but you see", "56:47", "the measles making it come back and", "56:50", "directly attributed to a lack of", "56:52", "vaccines you know what and it's not only", "56:55", "the vaccines themselves but it's the", "56:57", "prioritization of vaccines I mean well", "57:00", "you know one of the real tragic stories", "57:02", "right now in Africa is we are just", "57:04", "finally bringing to a close this", "57:07", "outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic", "57:08", "Republic of the Congo far northeast part", "57:10", "of the Congo you know 20-some thousand", "57:13", "people have died from this okay", "57:15", "bad been going on for almost two years", "57:17", "and everybody talks about that and I", "57:20", "understand why bola is a challenge but", "57:22", "you know that during that same time", "57:23", "period over 7,000 kids in that same area", "57:26", "have died from measles because everybody", "57:28", "was preoccupied trying to deal with", "57:30", "Ebola and in that those deaths were", "57:33", "totally preventable totally preventable", "57:35", "so yeah I mean I I think that's you know", "57:37", "I I have to say and you know this I'm", "57:39", "already on this show so I'm not trying", "57:41", "to thank you for what you do say about", "57:43", "vaccines because people listen to you", "57:44", "and we", "57:45", "need every positive voice because we", "57:47", "have so many crazy voices out there", "57:48", "right now Center so paranoid and", "57:51", "delusional and they want it all to be a", "57:55", "conspiracy there's been an amazing", "57:57", "medical innovation in in human culture", "58:00", "and that's vaccines", "58:02", "it's amazing what it's done and have", "58:04", "there been adverse perfect effects on", "58:06", "people of course everything everything", "58:08", "that people do there's some people are", "58:10", "gonna react in a bad way", "58:11", "it doesn't mean it's not a positive", "58:13", "thing and there's a reason why the cases", "58:16", "of polio are so tiny there's a reason", "58:18", "why smallpox went away it's because of", "58:20", "vaccines absolutely and you know what", "58:23", "that's one of the challenges you know", "58:25", "today between the the anti science", "58:28", "misinformation that's out there but then", "58:30", "when they don't see it yes and the", "58:32", "reason they don't see it is because we", "58:33", "did vaccinate until we get enough people", "58:35", "not vaccinated and then look what", "58:37", "happened there's a famous photo of two", "58:38", "twins from the early 20th century one of", "58:43", "them has smallpox and one of them was", "58:45", "vaccinated have you seen that I have I", "58:47", "have I have it's alive to my photo very", "58:49", "Kelly Jamie you'll find it because it's", "58:52", "people need to see it that that that is", "58:54", "the dirty up there is right there that's", "58:57", "it right there that's the one", "58:58", "one kid whose body is just devastated by", "59:01", "what looks like he's like pebbles glued", "59:03", "to his skin all over his body's face his", "59:06", "hands and then the his brother right", "59:09", "next to them with nothing and you know", "59:10", "what's really important to note here is", "59:12", "is that in that body all those things", "59:15", "are very painful but what's going on", "59:17", "inside the body is equally bad yeah and", "59:19", "so you're exactly right I couldn't agree", "59:21", "with you more", "59:21", "that you know this is this is really an", "59:24", "important point diseases are terrifying", "59:27", "they're really terrifying yeah and when", "59:29", "something like this can be prevented and", "59:31", "the reason why people don't do it is", "59:33", "because they're paranoid of vaccines and", "59:35", "they get that information from some", "59:37", "wacko website or some person who really", "59:39", "has no business talking about it you", "59:41", "know whether it's the people out there", "59:43", "that think it causes diseases or that", "59:45", "it's a government plot or that it's a", "59:47", "medical scam is just trying to raise", "59:49", "raised money it's just all that all of", "59:52", "its very very disturbing but it's a part", "59:54", "of people you know the human beings for", "59:58", "whatever reason", "59:59", "there's a percentage of us that lean", "60:01", "towards conspiratorial thinking and they", "60:05", "lean towards thinking that there's some", "60:08", "sort of a plot against them or the", "60:10", "governments against them and it's just", "60:12", "you gotta listen to the medical experts", "60:15", "you know and I hope that if there's any", "60:17", "good to come out of this terrible", "60:19", "coronavirus situation is there's a", "60:20", "wake-up call", "60:21", "if we'd had a vaccine for this or one", "60:24", "that even worked partially yeah think", "60:26", "how different we'd be and you know what", "60:28", "we got new other ones coming like those", "60:29", "we have to use our creative imagination", "60:32", "you know as I said in the book I the", "60:34", "chapter on coronavirus is the title is", "60:36", "SARS and MERS a harbinger of things to",

"69:50", "really multiplies in the nose remember", "69:52", "this virus is adapted not to multiply in", "69:54", "your lungs because the nose is colder", "69:56", "than the lung and so it'll grow here it", "69:58", "won't if you swallow it it won't grow in", "70:00", "your lungs if you've already been", "70:01", "infected ones then you actually have", "70:04", "some interference in your nose there's a", "70:06", "little bit of protection there so it", "70:07", "works well in kids who haven't been", "70:09", "infected before adults not so well for", "70:10", "us the injection works best and you know", "70:13", "I'm happy to report that although I'm", "70:15", "not happy to report being an old man now", "70:17", "I can even get the high-dose vaccine", "70:18", "over age 60 so so they are actually you", "70:22", "know the best we have the high-dose", "70:23", "vaccine is better yeah it's better than", "70:25", "the regular vaccine in turn you hit a", "70:27", "certain age yeah but when you get a", "70:29", "little older you need the higher dose", "70:30", "because your immune system starting to", "70:32", "wane", "70:32", "you know you can actually have an less", "70:34", "but what we need and aware that there", "70:36", "was yeah there's a high dose there's a", "70:37", "high dose yeah there's a higher dose", "70:38", "vaccine oh so where do you get it like", "70:41", "where if a person's listening this and", "70:42", "they like any doctor any doctor's office", "70:44", "and they will usually say that too if", "70:46", "you're old for you know 60 you can get", "70:49", "this vaccine so they'll actually do that", "70:51", "for you so yeah so run out get a get a", "70:54", "vaccine because - now is pretty much", "70:56", "over the flu season is waning I mean if", "70:58", "you hadn't gotten it you should have had", "70:59", "it a couple of months ago okay this", "71:01", "one's waning now we've had a bad flu", "71:03", "season really bad", "71:04", "but for the last couple weeks the", "71:06", "numbers are coming away down so what", "71:08", "what can person do other than the", "71:10", "vaccine to prevent getting the flu", "71:12", "that's primarily yet again it's a issue", "71:15", "of who you're around you know and you", "71:17", "know your body's overall health yep and", "71:20", "just keep healthy as you can and then I", "71:22", "think the other key piece though is if", "71:24", "you do get the flu and you have really", "71:26", "bad muscle aches one of the things about", "71:28", "in real influenza is not just sniffles", "71:31", "you feel like you got hit by a Mack", "71:33", "truck", "71:33", "if after several days you still are", "71:36", "really feeling bad really bad and you", "71:39", "haven't seen a physician by then you", "71:41", "should because that's when you get the", "71:43", "complications occurring the bacterial", "71:44", "pneumonias that occur subsequent and if", "71:46", "you get those treated earlier than later", "71:48", "you can actually do a lot to keep", "71:50", "somebody from dying so you know if you", "71:52", "don't feel a lot better in two days I", "71:54", "mean if you if you catch it really early", "71:56", "you can get a medication for flu there's", "71:58", "actually a medication that will reduce", "71:59", "your illness a bit but if you're if", "72:02", "you're sick for more than a couple days", "72:03", "not better", "72:04", "you absolutely should see a doctor so", "72:06", "you don't have these other complications", "72:08", "and what kind of doctor do once you any", "72:10", "family any family practitioner would", "72:12", "know what to look for and whether or not", "72:13", "your lungs are starting to fill up", "72:15", "you know if they'll they'll listen to", "72:16", "your lungs to make sure you're not going", "72:17", "developing pneumonia and what would they", "72:19", "do for you they would likely give you an", "72:21", "antibiotic based on what you had because", "72:23", "you are then this the problem with flu", "72:25", "is it's not just the flu virus but then", "72:27", "you get secondary bacterial pneumonia", "72:28", "from the damage in the lungs and so they", "72:30", "can prevent that a lot of older people", "72:32", "in particular will die from actually", "72:34", "what we call secondary pneumonia to", "72:37", "having had influenza they wouldn't", "72:38", "gotten the pneumonia if they had not had", "72:40", "flu but then they do now we were talking", "72:43", "earlier about probiotics do do is there", "72:46", "a benefit of probiotics once you've", "72:48", "taken antibiotics to Riefler --is-- your", "72:50", "gut flora you know that's where the", "72:53", "studies really at this point have", "72:55", "demonstrated that it's very temporary in", "72:57", "other words if you're taking probiotics", "72:59", "you can get a boost initially but it", "73:02", "doesn't sustain yourself over time and", "73:04", "then the natural flora comes back I mean", "73:06", "the gut microbes will come back as as", "73:09", "they've been reduced but what I'm saying", "73:12", "is is it beneficial to people if they do", "73:15", "take a probiotic after antibiotics", "73:18", "antibiotics do have a devastating effect", "73:20", "on your floor yeah", "73:22", "kills the bad stuff but it also kills a", "73:23", "lot of the good stuff right yeah so is", "73:25", "it beneficial for people once they have", "73:27", "taken an antibiotic to take probiotics", "73:29", "to sort of reflect an pereira yeah and", "73:32", "that's what i'm saying is that it", "73:33", "doesn't the data don't support that it", "73:37", "stays in other words you get a", "73:38", "short-term boost material but they don't", "73:43", "stay around what if you just keep taking", "73:44", "it even then they they just don't stay", "73:47", "around your normal gut flora will come", "73:48", "back and take over so the probiotics and", "73:51", "of themselves are not giving you that", "73:53", "long-term boost so you don't think", "73:55", "there's any benefit to having even even", "73:57", "a short-term boost well you know it's", "73:59", "again I surely I'm not gonna profess to", "74:02", "be the expert on probiotics right tell", "74:04", "you that the data we have doesn't show", "74:06", "that they have a big boost and and that", "74:08", "they actually help you long term or", "74:10", "short term meaning that it makes any", "74:12", "difference now there's one exception to", "74:14", "that where I would say and this is a", "74:16", "very different thing than probiotics but", "74:18", "we actually have a disease called", "74:20", "Clostridium difficile which is a bad", "74:24", "bacteria that happens when you've taken", "74:26", "away too many antibiotics and and it's", "74:27", "colonizes your gut because you don't", "74:29", "have competing organisms there and then", "74:32", "you can die from this there are", "74:34", "treatments for that called actually", "74:36", "fecal transplants yeah I've heard of", "74:38", "that and that's where actually there you", "74:40", "take it little capsules but it's", "74:42", "actually drinking poop when purified", "74:45", "purified bugs from the poop you're right", "74:46", "but you take that and that's that's that", "74:49", "kind of is what you're talking about", "74:50", "that does have a real benefit and there", "74:52", "is clear evidence that if you take those", "74:54", "those fecal transplants as opposed to", "74:56", "just probiotics or such that that can", "74:59", "have a major positive impact on your", "75:01", "recovery from things like claustrum", "75:03", "difficile infection and so more and more", "75:05", "institutions now actually are doing", "75:07", "fecal transplants which you'd never", "75:09", "thought that that would be one thing you", "75:10", "do one day but after those have had this", "75:12", "problem they're there life-saving there", "75:14", "maybe we should change the name that", "75:17", "would although on the other hand you", "75:19", "don't forget it if yeah yeah you don't", "75:23", "forget if it's a fecal transplant but", "75:24", "that's what's gonna be yeah", "75:26", "nerve-wracking to people yeah yeah you", "75:29", "know once you're that sick boy it feels", "75:30", "good to take", "75:31", "it does you know have you done it I've", "75:33", "never done it I've never had a problem", "75:35", "where I've had to but but for the I've", "75:37", "know people who have been desperately", "75:38", "sick who have taken them and have really", "75:40", "done much better much much better I want", "75:42", "to ask you about Lyme disease sure Lyme", "75:44", "disease is a scary one", "75:46", "right and I mean so many of my friends", "75:48", "in the East Coast have it it's really", "75:49", "terrifying that that that part of the", "75:51", "country in particular seems to be like", "75:54", "really badly infected with these these", "75:56", "ticks that carry this disease what can", "76:00", "people do to prevent that and what can", "76:03", "we there's no vaccine for Lyme disease", "76:05", "and I know there was at one point but", "76:07", "people were having an issue with I mean", "76:09", "a good friend of mine her dad actually", "76:13", "got Lyme disease from the vaccine before", "76:17", "they discontinued it what can someone do", "76:20", "to sort of protect themselves", "76:23", "yeah well Lyme disease in of itself is a", "76:26", "fascinating story I've actually been", "76:28", "involved with it since its early", "76:30", "discovery in the 1980s and Minnesota", "76:32", "Wisconsin was a big focus the Upper", "76:34", "Midwest and this is a story that I think", "76:36", "you'll find interesting is is that even", "76:39", "though it was discovered primarily in", "76:41", "the eastern part of the United States", "76:42", "named after a Lyme Connecticut it's a", "76:45", "disease that actually probably", "76:47", "originated in the Upper Midwest and I", "76:50", "tell you that because it turns out that", "76:52", "there is a focus in northern Wisconsin", "76:54", "in and east central Minnesota where", "76:57", "there's Lyme disease there's another", "76:58", "disease called anaplasmosis there's", "77:00", "another disease but Visia etc that all", "77:03", "seem to have a similar kind of tick", "77:05", "human deer kind of component and back in", "77:09", "the ccc days of the 1930s the", "77:15", "white-tailed deer population had been", "77:16", "virtually totally depopulated from the", "77:18", "northeast and so they actually trapped", "77:21", "deer in northern Wisconsin and took them", "77:24", "out and de+ in the New York and", "77:26", "Connecticut and so forth and most of", "77:29", "those deer are actually deer that you", "77:31", "know today their great great great great", "77:34", "great grandfather came from Wisconsin", "77:35", "Wow and guess what when you move deer", "77:38", "you move ticks in fact I was involved", "77:40", "with the study that the Wisconsin", "77:42", "Division of Health did and a colleague", "77:43", "of mine the late Jeff Davis", "77:45", "we're up in northern Wisconsin as deer", "77:48", "would come into the check station and", "77:50", "they would actually measure the number", "77:52", "of ticks that were attached to the nape", "77:54", "of the neck okay and they had a lot of", "77:56", "thing drawn and they asked hunters who", "77:58", "were driving back to Madison and", "78:00", "Milwaukee if they would be willing to", "78:02", "check in at a station down there for", "78:05", "just a second and then they were gonna", "78:06", "count the ticks again and it turned out", "78:09", "that as the vehicles come rolling down", "78:13", "from highway 51 from northern Wisconsin", "78:15", "get on the interstate 90 94 and go to", "78:17", "Milwaukee or Madison the ticks just kept", "78:20", "falling off by the time they get to", "78:22", "Madison or Milwaukee the ticks are", "78:23", "almost all gone", "78:24", "well guess lo and behold where all the", "78:27", "Lyme disease so forth started to show up", "78:29", "right along the interstate corner Wow", "78:31", "because the ticks were coming off and", "78:33", "then they were getting into the local", "78:35", "deer in that population and so it's", "78:36", "exactly you said the ticks are moving", "78:38", "they're moving okay they've moved and", "78:40", "they're now infected so I think that", "78:42", "that this Lyme disease issue is a key", "78:44", "one Lyme disease is really an important", "78:47", "disease it's real no question about it", "78:49", "the challenge we have is is that there's", "78:52", "a lot of people that assume that they", "78:54", "have chronic Lyme infection and you know", "78:56", "the data on that is just really really", "78:59", "not there to support that these people", "79:00", "are chronically infected but they do", "79:02", "have an immune response likely that", "79:05", "occurs where it sets up this trigger and",

"79:17", "immune systems we've talked about", "79:18", "several times today but starts attacking", "79:20", "you site I think it's a similar picture", "79:23", "we see with chronic fatigue syndrome", "79:24", "same kind of thing these people really", "79:26", "are sick they really do have problems", "79:28", "but it's not something you can treat so", "79:30", "when people I I have a challenge because", "79:32", "when people take IV antibiotics at", "79:34", "extended periods of time for Lyme", "79:36", "disease you know the data there's four", "79:39", "different studies not have been done", "79:40", "where people have had what we call a", "79:43", "double-blind of control", "79:45", "well SIBO controlled trial where half", "79:47", "got the drug half got a IV but no drug", "79:51", "and it turned out all four of these", "79:53", "studies and Lyme disease the people who", "79:54", "got the gist the placebo did just the", "79:58", "same as the people", "79:58", "got the drug and I worry that we're", "80:01", "using antibiotics a lot there and this", "80:03", "is where I just mentioned earlier about", "80:04", "claustrum difficile we actually had a", "80:06", "patient

know", "80:49", "we you know thank God for our immune", "80:51", "system is what fights off all the bad", "80:53", "things we have but sometimes that immune", "80:55", "system gets turned on too much yeah and", "80:58", "then it takes on us okay and and it goes", "81:01", "back to the corona virus that's why a", "81:02", "lot of these people are dying right now", "81:04", "is this over vigorous

if we treat you", "81:13", "it's not like it's like every other", "81:15", "bacteria you can really get rid of it", "81:17", "but you still have this chronic illness", "81:21", "that's occurring and

about", "82:34", "this of in terms of what is it that's", "82:36", "making these people like this and this", "82:39", "is really important and is there", "82:40", "anything they can do to eradicate

you know non pine", "83:25", "or any kind of like the oak trees of the", "83:27", "Upper Midwest are all disappearing", "83:29", "because oak trees need sunlight and", "83:31", "fires what kept they were very resistant", "83:34", "to fire and so the old oak forests and", "83:35", "so forth would would survive because of", "83:38", "fire whereas today with no fire you know", "83:42", "the Elms and the maples and everything", "83:44", "else comes in and the buckthorn all that", "83:46", "kind of stuff and takes over so so", "83:48", "what's happening is in our state of", "83:51", "Minnesota is we have a really good", "83:52", "example of this as we're losing our", "83:54", "moose and the big primary reason is", "83:56", "brain worm it's rain more brain room", "83:58", "it's a type of parasite that's common", "84:01", "and whitetail deer but causes no", "84:02", "problems in moose it actually causes a", "84:06", "brain infection and it kills them and", "84:07", "guess why is

Minnesota because of lack of", "84:18", "fire because the forest is changing so", "84:21", "now where they're only used to be moose", "84:23", "we're seeing deer and moose and where", "84:24", "that intersection is", "84:26", "we're starting to see moose develop this", "84:27", "brain worm infection because it's from", "84:29", "the deer so the tick population has", "84:31", "changed too and it's largely due to the", "84:33", "fire lack of fire in many places in the", "84:36", "Northeast never used to be like it was", "84:38", "we had fire all the time that would", "84:40", "clear out these areas and it was just a", "84:42", "part of natural everything so so one of", "84:44", "the challenges we have with ticks is", "84:45", "they're here we're not gonna change how", "84:48", "we live suburbs and you know trees and", "84:50", "all that controlled burns eliminate a", "84:54", "lot of them they do because what they do", "84:55", "is they just eliminate the ticks but", "84:57", "what they do is they eliminate for", "84:59", "example the white field mice or all", "85:00", "these different species that are", "85:02", "important to the ticks and then they", "85:05", "bring in different species that will", "85:07", "will be there so I mean this is a big", "85:09", "debate in Minnesota right now I mean", "85:10", "we're losing all these moose to brain", "85:12", "worm ironically the moose or population", "85:15", "is expanding dramatically and I'll Royal", "85:17", "why because there's no deer out there", "85:20", "and so they're not getting brain worm", "85:22", "out there so people have said you know", "85:24", "the we're gonna lose our moose well so", "85:26", "it's the deer so", "85:27", "so fire actually has helped the most in", "85:29", "areas in northern Minnesota where", "85:30", "there's been a lot of fire the moose", "85:32", "population is growing because the deer", "85:34", "are not there because exactly those", "85:37", "mammals those rodents and so forth are", "85:39", "very different in burnt-out areas and", "85:41", "they are and find non burnt-out areas", "85:43", "well they do control burns in some", "85:45", "states I got a I had a friend who's", "85:47", "hunting in Washington State a couple of", "85:48", "years ago and he said it was really", "85:50", "weird because there's these massive", "85:51", "fires in the distance that were actually", "85:53", "being controlled they do it on purpose", "85:55", "yeah which is a lot better than having", "85:57", "the out of control fires where you have", "85:59", "so much fuel yeah and you know if you", "86:01", "haven't had a forest fire in eighty five", "86:03", "hundred years in an area the fuel and", "86:05", "there's huge yeah and so actually they", "86:07", "do that in northern Minnesota - they're", "86:08", "doing control burns and the prairies of", "86:10", "course we do control burns all the time", "86:11", "so but the problem with the East Coast", "86:13", "is you're dealing with a lot of these", "86:15", "sort of almost residential areas that", "86:17", "have all these ticks yeah you can't then", "86:19", "they're you can't there we have to find", "86:20", "ways that's that's where we really have", "86:22", "to have vaccines and treatments for", "86:24", "these diseases Rock get rid of the ticks", "86:26", "so what we have to do is figure out I", "86:28", "mean wouldn't we have a cocktail vaccine", "86:32", "for male Babesia for Lyme disease for", "86:35", "yeah you know that's what we need is", "86:37", "there any kind of an animal that eats", "86:38", "ticks", "86:39", "birds yeah birds will eat them but not", "86:42", "enough no no no no they're they're doing", "86:44", "very well thank you ticks do very well", "86:46", "and that's another issue you know for", "86:48", "some of the larger mammals as you know", "86:49", "tick predation can get so heavy", "86:51", "particularly in in in certain times of", "86:54", "the year that the it really literally", "86:56", "takes a lot of blood on these large", "86:57", "animals even though they're so big yeah", "87:00", "rabbit hold the other day online and I", "87:02", "saw this one deer that was covered in", "87:05", "these frisbee sighs yeah patches of", "87:07", "ticks that's exactly what all swollen", "87:09", "also and they're full of blood", "87:10", "oh and it happens day after day so that", "87:13", "it is a hit on them it's a real hit on", "87:15", "them to pull up a picture of that just", "87:17", "have freaked people out of watching", "87:18", "online just they need to see this yeah", "87:20", "yeah it's pretty amazing it's one of", "87:22", "those things that when you talk about", "87:23", "ticks and you talk about Lyme disease", "87:25", "most people their eyes glaze over they", "87:27", "don't even care it's not affecting me", "87:29", "until someone in your family has it yep", "87:31", "there's a guy that I know who was a", "87:34", "former UFC fighter Marcus Davis who he", "87:36", "put he had his wife got Lyme disease and", "87:39", "he spent hundreds of thousands of", "87:41", "dollars trying to trying to help burn", "87:44", "and do something about in treatments and", "87:46", "all these different things for it yeah", "87:48", "it's a it's a real challenge it's a", "87:50", "challenge and this is another area again", "87:51", "you know when you think of the amount of", "87:53", "money we lose in just lost time let", "87:56", "alone pain and suffering yeah what an", "87:59", "investment to make it is I mean this", "88:01", "this is the kind of thing this is where", "88:02", "infectious diseases really needed a", "88:04", "renaissance I mean well we do a lot here", "88:05", "we pulled up a chart of the United", "88:08", "States where they showed the areas that", "88:10", "are affected by these ticks and what", "88:13", "what percentage of ticks carry Lyme", "88:15", "disease they've tested and some places", "88:18", "in the Northeast this and the 60% Oh", "88:20", "exactly", "88:21", "yeah it is it's huge it's growing and", "88:23", "it's ground", "88:24", "I mean you've made me you and understand", "88:26", "how wildlife has changed I mean look at", "88:27", "to think that we have all these wild", "88:29", "coyote populations in New York City now", "88:31", "yes it mean it's amazing how the animals", "88:34", "the city in the country yeah you know", "88:35", "what the rats aren't doing the coyotes", "88:37", "are taken out and it's it's it's a", "88:40", "challenge I mean these are effect", "88:41", "infectious disease issues too they're", "88:43", "they're very real yeah they have coyotes", "88:44", "in Central Park they do yeah absolutely", "88:47", "then the Bronx they have them and it's", "88:49", "weird it's weird to see because this is", "88:51", "something", "88:52", "just didn't exist before look at this", "88:55", "that's very good that's okay yeah that's", "88:59", "okay that's not not that's not the best", "89:00", "I've seen but it's gross enough yeah it", "89:02", "is it gives you a good sense of it", "89:04", "though yeah dan Flores who has been a", "89:06", "guest on the podcast before has a great", "89:08", "book called coyote America that sort of", "89:10", "details how this came to be and how", "89:12", "these coyotes have look at that all over", "89:15", "that poor deer look at the eye on the", "89:17", "fawn yeah yeah they're disgusting yeah", "89:21", "but the Coyotes about how when they got", "89:26", "rid of the wolves and they tried to do", "89:29", "the same to the coyote they just", "89:30", "actually expanded their territory and", "89:31", "they're sneaky", "89:32", "very clever little animals adaption yeah", "89:36", "just like microbes adaption you know is", "89:39", "there anything else that we should cover", "89:40", "no I mean I think I thank you for", "89:43", "covering this issue an interesting", "89:45", "disease as we can use all the help we", "89:47", "can to get people to be aware of what's", "89:49", "out there and what's coming and just", "89:51", "keeping the message straight and we're", "89:53", "gonna get through this but at the same", "89:55", "time it's going to be a challenge you", "89:56", "know today you have an underlying health", "89:58", "problem and you're particularly over age", "90:01", "50 55 I'd say avoid big crowds if you", "90:04", "can and that's going to be really", "90:05", "important and know that we're gonna work", "90:08", "on the critical drug supply to make sure", "90:10", "that people aren't without drugs that", "90:12", "save their lives every day that's gonna", "90:13", "be a big challenge", "90:14", "one more question how long does it take", "90:16", "to develop a vaccine for this", "90:17", "coronavirus well you know when I'm asked", "90:21", "that question I don't mean to sound glib", "90:24", "again but I can make a vaccine for an", "90:25", "overnight the question is is it safe and", "90:27", "effective hmm and that's the challenge", "90:31", "we have right now questions about how do", "90:33", "you make community to a coronavirus and", "90:35", "what kind of vaccines you have to have", "90:37", "that brings in all the different parts", "90:39", "of the immune system so we don't know", "90:41", "that yet so some of this research is", "90:42", "going to have to be basic to that the", "90:44", "second thing we have to worry about of", "90:45", "safety there's a condition in humans", "90:48", "called antibody dependent enhancement", "90:50", "8ee and it turns out that if you have no", "90:53", "antibody or immune response you'll get", "90:56", "the disease if you have a lot you're", "90:57", "protected but if you have this", "90:58", "in-between level and then you get the", "91:01", "disease it actually enhances the disease", "91:04", "immune response is really destructive", "91:06", "and in fact there was just a couple", "91:09", "years ago a major recall of dengue", "91:11", "vaccine the type of vaccine we used for", "91:13", "mosquito infection in the Philippines", "91:15", "were kids who got the vaccine actually", "91:17", "made just a little bit of antibody and", "91:19", "when they got the real disease that made", "91:21", "him a lot sicker and so we found with", "91:23", "the 2003 SARS vaccine that there was an", "91:26", "80 e component to it when we made it in", "91:28", "animals and so we're gonna have to", "91:30", "really study this to be sure it's safe", "91:32", "and as you said earlier you know we can", "91:34", "surely make mistakes we don't you know", "91:36", "we needed to I mean we can not - and so", "91:38", "I think between getting the", "91:40", "effectiveness and the safety data", "91:42", "together were years out I mean maybe", "91:45", "years yeah this is not going to happen", "91:47", "soon yeah you know it's wishful thinking", "91:50", "you know every time I mean I go back to", "91:51", "SARS in 2003 and look at every event", "91:54", "Zika 2015 we said Oh we'll have a", "91:57", "vaccine for it in no time here we are", "91:58", "five years later and we've no vaccine", "92:00", "and so this is one of the challenges we", "92:03", "have we have to complete the job you", "92:05", "know it's like we start on something and", "92:07", "then we forget that it's important", "92:09", "because it kind of goes away for a while", "92:10", "but only to come back and so this is", "92:13", "part of that picture we talked about and", "92:14", "this is what Peter Hotez talks a lot", "92:16", "about you know we gotta finish the job", "92:18", "on these things you know I worry that", "92:20", "we'll get through this situation and", "92:22", "then people say oh we're done and then", "92:23", "we'll forget until the next one comes", "92:24", "along and so so this is where vaccine", "92:28", "research and development is really", "92:29", "important how do they test for safety so", "92:32", "once they come up with a potential", "92:34", "vaccine how do they make sure that it's", "92:36", "safe what you do it gradually first of", "92:38", "all you put it into animals to see and", "92:41", "you know enough about them how their", "92:42", "immune responses what do they do then", "92:44", "you put it into a few humans 30 humans", "92:46", "you know they volunteer willingly", "92:48", "knowing to see what kind of reactions", "92:50", "they have well I would just take really", "92:52", "bad people that are in jail and practice", "92:54", "on them well I I don't know if that's", "92:56", "doable here in this country without", "92:58", "their informed consent so I'll just", "93:00", "wrump can fix that anybody if we have a", "93:03", "shot at doing that with any president", "93:04", "it's try just start with rapists yeah so", "93:08", "anyway the bottom line though is is that", "93:09", "then they gradually work their way up to", "93:11", "larger studies where you know if", "93:12", "something happens one every thousand", "93:14", "people you have to study a lot of people", "93:16", "before you know the chance that you", "93:17", "might find that right", "93:19", "30 people so that's why it's gonna take", "93:20", "a while and you know they'll test it on", "93:23", "more and more people and they're going", "93:24", "as fast as they can", "93:25", "it's not like there's anybody dragging", "93:27", "their feet it's just that you know I", "93:29", "joke in lyc\u00e9e it's like if the Iowa", "93:31", "farmer wanted to harvest corn in half", "93:33", "the time it doesn't mean by planting", "93:34", "twice as many acres he can do that you", "93:36", "know planting in April you still can't", "93:38", "harvest October that's a good thing", "93:40", "that's what this is it's gonna take us", "93:42", "this long to get this vaccine well", "93:44", "Michael I appreciate you and I", "93:46", "appreciate your time and deadliest
