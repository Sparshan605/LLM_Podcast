why the effects are much more", "03:39", "robust always on like the developing", "03:42", "fetus and so I was really made sure I", "03:44", "was like not drinking anything out of a", "03:46", "plastic

we", "04:10", "take into our body all the time right", "04:12", "yeah and then the fact that actually", "04:15", "aging bottles like as you for whatever", "04:17", "reason as a bottle sis like if you

you think you're", "04:42", "gonna have right now one is its its I am", "04:46", "so satisfied I'm full of so much joy and", "04:48", "it's a lot of work and I you know he's", "04:51", "13 months so

I'm not gonna like you know say for", "05:05", "sure it's it's a lot of work it's a lot", "05:08", "of work yeah and you know it's just", "05:10", "adding another it's like well you you", "05:12",

"they developed a very unique bond they", "05:40", "fight all the time over nothing like", "05:43", "give me that it's mine it's mine like", "05:45", "you know all sudden like whoa whoa whoa", "05:46", "what happened you know like there's", "05:48", "always like some blow-up because they", "05:50", "have zero control of their emotions", "05:52", "anything that goes wrong it's just a", "05:56", "floodgate it's either on or it's off and", "05:59", "but they're really good at apologizing", "06:01", "too which is really interesting we've", "06:02", "taught them how to do that how to just", "06:04", "say look everybody gets emotional it's", "06:06", "okay apologize and hug it out yeah I", "06:09", "think it's also another thing that wood", "06:11", "is really important is teaching or your", "06:12", "children how to be happy like you know", "06:15", "because that's important they see that", "06:17", "though they'll see that in you you know", "06:19", "they imitate their environment if they", "06:21", "see you know that you know how to be", "06:23", "happy and then you can turn things", "06:25", "around and you know make light of", "06:27", "situations and they'll they'll they take", "06:30", "on these behavior patterns really that's", "06:31", "one of the more fascinating things is", "06:33", "watching kids go wow what are you gonna", "06:35", "do you know like when you do what are", "06:37", "you gonna do and then you see them go", "06:39", "what are you gonna do you're like wow", "06:41", "watching an eight-year-old figure that I", "06:43", "was kind of cool yeah that's nice that's", "06:45", "nice to know", "06:45", "yeah like right now my son he's just", "06:47", "almost always just happy you know it's", "06:49", "so and I'm thinking about like future", "06:56", "does anything you know where ever", "06:58", "thought what if he's gay", "06:59", "yeah and that's where I'm like you know", "07:02", "all the endocrine disrupters yeah who", "07:08", "knows who knows what's happening yeah I", "07:11", "mean and what's what's of major concern", "07:15", "to me is living in major metropolitan", "07:18", "areas with a constant pollution and I", "07:21", "was reading a study that was talking", "07:22", "about living in any major metropolitan", "07:25", "area like New York City can take many", "07:28", "years off of your life just from living", "07:30", "there it will shorten your life yeah", "07:33", "I've been reading multiple studies over", "07:34", "the years about air pollution and you", "07:37", "know there's there's compounds in air", "07:39", "pollution that are carcinogens like you", "07:40", "know benzene and there's also the", "07:42", "particulate matter and how these you", "07:44", "know how air pollution is increasing the", "07:47", "risk for stroke heart attack Alzheimer's", "07:49", "disease and this is like in", "07:52", "dose-dependent manners and of course", "07:53", "there's all sorts of

are really bad in", "08:03", "developing nations that don't have a lot", "08:05", "of regulatory right regulations on for", "08:09", "example like automobile exhaust and so", "08:11", "some some developing countries have like", "08:13", "children coming down with like strokes", "08:14", "and stuff like early like young teenage", "08:17", "so and it's been this is of course you", "08:20", "know been linked to air pollution so", "08:23", "it's it's definitely a concern and then", "08:25", "there's all sorts of studies talking", "08:26", "about you know of course asthma but you", "08:30", "know happiness and and and bring", "08:32", "function and all that you know so and", "08:35", "it's something like I live off of a busy", "08:36", "road and then there's noise pollution", "08:38", "which is another I mean so I it's like", "08:42", "something that I've been like really", "08:43", "really aware of and trying to like move", "08:46", "out away from busy traffic II areas", "08:50", "pretty for my son", "08:52", "you know because I'm just very concerned", "08:53", "about the health risks yeah I wonder", "08:56", "also the in the impact of just being in", "09:00", "an urban environment and the fact that", "09:01", "it's not really natural and that maybe a", "09:04", "person who's an adult could enjoy living", "09:07", "in Manhattan and decide that they get a",

"09:19", "maybe not conducive to healthy brain", "09:23", "development or that's not like what your", "09:25", "what your body or your brain is", "09:27", "naturally craving right there's been", "09:29", "studies looking at for example like", "09:30", "people that exercise in a metropolitan", "09:33", "area versus like out in like a park", "09:35", "nature and the you know all sorts of", "09:39", "measurements of you know depressive", "09:41", "symptoms are measured after and the ones", "09:43", "that measured that did nature run we're", "09:47", "far better at you know basically feeling", "09:49", "feeling happier after after the run and", "09:51", "the people that did in metropolitan city", "09:53", "that make sense I mean I think that's", "09:55", "why people like Central Park in New York", "09:57", "City just says yeah you get something I", "10:00", "mean it's really a great place it's", "10:02", "really quite big one of the things about", "10:04", "Central Park when you're in it you're", "10:05", "like wow it's weird that this is in the", "10:08", "middle of the city but it's a brilliant", "10:09", "move", "10:09", "to have this one I mean you think about", "10:12", "how much that real estate would be worth", "10:14", "it just said just to shove buildings in", "10:16", "there", "10:16", "I mean Manhattan is one of the most", "10:19", "pricey real estate places on the planet", "10:21", "Earth and yet in the middle of it they", "10:23", "have this big open public park area that", "10:27", "anyone could just wander around sit by a", "10:29", "tree it's really a very very smart move", "10:31", "yeah it is it is nice la should have", "10:34", "something like that is the air pollution", "10:36", "do you know if the air pollution what's", "10:37", "like in Manhattan it's terrible it's", "10:39", "terrible in Manhattan to LA I think", "10:42", "they're probably equally sucky but the", "10:45", "thing that is bothering me is not just", "10:47", "the air pollution in terms of like the", "10:49", "exhaust fumes and the exhaust the smells", "10:54", "but also the brake dust you know when I", "10:57", "first started paying attention to brake", "10:59", "dust and I would always clean it off my", "11:02", "wheels but I would never think about it", "11:04", "like oh there's dust", "11:06", "that's on my wheels I would think I was", "11:07", "just dust and he wasn't then some was", "11:09", "explaining to me no that's an", "11:10", "environmental hazard that you're", "11:12", "breathing in if you live in that", "11:13", "environment when you're around you know", "11:15", "if you're on Broadway and cars are", "11:17", "constantly hitting their brakes around", "11:18", "you there's a puff of that brake dust as", "11:21", "getting in the air with every pump of", "11:23", "the brakes Wow and you're just taking", "11:25", "that disgusting stuff into your lungs", "11:27", "yeah the particulate matter that's", "11:29", "really tiny and stuff yeah I mean cuz", "11:32", "that's like mesothelioma right you're", "11:33", "taking in the particulate matter from", "11:35", "like asbestos mm-hmm so in the same", "11:37", "you'd think there'd be similar", "11:38", "mechanisms may not gonna lead to", "11:39", "mesothelioma but that there would be", "11:42", "similar mechanisms at play that are like", "11:44", "you know damaging organs good to visit", "11:47", "not good to stay that's what I think I", "11:50", "mean my I've no desire I don't even like", "11:53", "living here I think there's too many", "11:54", "people yeah it's I definitely don't like", "11:57", "driving here like it's like it's it's", "12:00", "really bad how much is the difference", "12:02", "between here and we're in San Diego San", "12:04", "Diego is definitely bad during you know", "12:08", "typical times people are there going to", "12:09", "work or coming coming home from work but", "12:12", "it's it's it's nothing like LA I mean LA", "12:15", "is orders of magnitude worse for now if", "12:18", "you're not doing clinical research you", "12:21", "could do a lot of your stuff somewhere", "12:22", "else have you thought about being", "12:24", "somewhere else so my family's in San", "12:27", "Diego and it's really nice having my mom", "12:31", "in particular because she helps out a", "12:33", "lot with my son so that I can get some", "12:36", "work done too right which is important", "12:38", "and I really didn't we could live you", "12:40", "know a little bit further out I mean", "12:42", "there's there are places like that are", "12:43", "still within like 40 minute drive to", "12:45", "like you know downtown San Diego beaches", "12:48", "and stuff that are that are nice and so", "12:52", "that is something that we are", "12:53", "considering we require definitely quiet", "12:56", "or no matter what it's gonna be you know", "12:58", "cuz we live there's just it's a busy", "13:00", "road and there's fire sirens and you", "13:03", "know my son likes the fire science but", "13:05", "there there have been times when there", "13:06", "have been loud motorcycles and he is", "13:08", "like concerned like you can see you", "13:10", "looking like it's you know so so it kind", "13:13", "of worries me as well", "13:16", "but definitely it's it's it's important", "13:19", "to get away from that it's like a goal", "13:21", "for sure now before the podcast started", "13:24", "you were telling me that you wrote a 30", "13:27", "page paper on the carnivore diet it's", "13:31", "not a paper well it's I definitely spent", "13:33", "a lot early pages I thought about it for", "13:36", "a long time and yes there's 30 pages of", "13:39", "thoughts and references well you stunned", "13:41", "that this became I mean this is a very", "13:42", "recent thing yeah people are just eating", "13:46", "meat well at first when I was mean I", "13:50", "think Dan told me about it like a couple", "13:52", "years ago even like and and I thought", "13:55", "there's no way I was like I just ignored", "13:58", "it I don't have time for that so yeah I", "14:03", "definitely dismissed it when I when I", "14:09", "first heard about it but it's definitely", "14:10", "been something that has you know gained", "14:13", "a lot of traction yeah you know disturb", "14:16", "you that it's gained traction well I", "14:19", "definitely have concerns you know I", "14:21", "think that the the most important", "14:24", "question really is what is attracting", "14:28", "someone to try the very restrictive diet", "14:32", "you know that potentially could be", "14:35", "dangerous without published evidence or", "14:38", "any sort of long-term studies and things", "14:40", "like that so I think that the first", "14:42", "question really is well why are people", "14:43", "doing this and so looking on the", "14:45", "internet and try to like read about", "14:47", "people's anecdotes it seems as though a", "14:50", "lot of people are drawn to it because", "14:52", "they have some sort of autoimmune", "14:54", "problem and so they try this diet and it", "14:58", "improves their autoimmune symptoms and I", "15:01", "see that seems to be a real common theme", "15:03", "mm-hmm in at least if you if you look in", "15:06", "the blogosphere and stuff like that so", "15:09", "that's I think kind of a good place to", "15:11", "start where it's like well you know what", "15:14", "are people doing this for and then so", "15:17", "that's that's kind of an important", "15:18", "question and so so further reading about", "15:22", "this diet it sort of sort of think about", "15:26", "well okay well what's going on it's", "15:28", "really important", "15:29", "when you have like something that leads", "15:31", "to an effect to understand the mechanism", "15:33", "because the mechanism is you know what's", "15:36", "leading to to this effect and so if you", "15:38", "can do something that's potentially not", "15:39", "so dangerous or risky then understanding", "15:43", "the mechanism will help you because then", "15:45", "you can find other ways to do it right", "15:46", "and so if you look at at published", "15:50", "Studies on people that eat low carb high", "15:52", "protein diets", "15:53", "what's pretty common is that there", "15:57", "there's changes that happen in a variety", "15:59", "of different endocrine factors like you", "16:01", "know you're less insulin that's changing", "16:04", "your satiety and hunger hormones leptin", "16:06", "and ghrelin and people become more", "16:08", "satiated and they actually eat less and", "16:09", "this has been shown in multiple studies", "16:12", "so people actually eat less when they're", "16:14", "having a higher protein diet which makes", "16:16", "sense to you because protein is more", "16:17", "satiating as well and also there's also", "16:23", "been Studies on what's called food", "16:25", "habituation we're basically so", "16:27", "habituation is when you're constantly", "16:28", "exposed to the same stimulus you sort of", "16:30", "have a decreased response to that", "16:31", "stimulus where there's been intervention", "16:33", "trials where people are given the same", "16:35", "food every single day both non obese and", "16:38", "obese people versus people that are", "16:40", "given the same food once a week and the", "16:42", "people that are given the same food", "16:43", "every single day they just they start to", "16:45", "eat less calories so they start to eat", "16:47", "less naturally sorta to calwork restrict", "16:51", "themselves so I mean and that's it's", "16:53", "kind of like a dietary monotony a sort", "16:56", "of thing so I think there and you know", "16:58", "if you read and people out there on the", "17:00", "blogs talking about this diet they say I", "17:02", "like I'm eating less I only eat twice a", "17:03", "day I'm fasting you know that's people", "17:05", "are talking about that as well mm-hmm so", "17:07", "I think there's published evidence to", "17:09", "kind of explain that and also there's", "17:11", "you know people saying yeah I eat less", "17:13", "so that's an important point", "17:16", "because one thing that's really known to", "17:18", "affect autoimmunity is calorie", "17:21", "restriction and fasting like it's", "17:22", "probably one of

know I think", "44:04", "and I'm sure I mean I know this I've", "44:07", "seen it all over the blogosphere you", "44:09", "know the the micronutrients and you know", "44:12", "they don't really matter they're the", "44:13", "RDAs weren't set for carnivores and all", "44:15", "this all this stuff that I've read but I", "44:18", "think to start out like understanding", "44:19", "you know

all", "44:53", "sorts of things really important and and", "44:57", "so there's about 30 of them that are", "45:00", "essential you have to get them for your", "45:01", "diet because you don't make them in your", "45:02", "body and if you don't get them from your", "45:04", "diet it can lead to you know health", "45:05", "problems and death actually so so that's", "45:08", "that's kind of you know what", "45:10", "micronutrients are are das so", "45:12", "recommended dietary allowance those have", "45:16", "been set a variety of different studies", "45:18", "are used so there's

"there's a bell curve and so it's like", "46:08", "literally in the middle of the bell", "46:09", "curve and then the RDA is set from that", "46:12", "to standard deviations above and it's", "46:14",

because you know", "46:31", "micronutrients there's a lot of you know", "46:34", "certain micronutrients that are", "46:35", "concentrated in meat and there's a lot", "46:37", "that are concentrated

get it from the plants so one of the", "46:58", "of course the micronutrients that's a", "46:59", "concern is the vitamin C of course right", "47:01", "that's the one that everyone talks about", "47:04", "so vitamin C is a really important", "47:07", "cofactor for what that means a cofactor", "47:09", "just means that it's binds to an enzyme", "47:11", "and helps it work it's important for",

induced", "51:40", "damage and so that's kind of how the RDA", "51:42", "was set now the question is in any with", "51:46", "any RDA like you know the the important", "51:49", "thing to consider is well the RDAs are", "51:51", "set to prevent acute disease but what", "51:54", "about promoting optimal health you know", "51:57", "like that's really important like how", "51:58", "much of these micronutrients do you need", "52:00", "throughout a lifespan to to you know to", "52:02", "maintain optimal health and age well so", "52:05", "this is something that's really", "52:06", "important because a lot of enzymes that", "52:09", "require micronutrient for preventing", "52:11", "short-term disease something that can", "52:13", "kill you like there's also enzymes that", "52:16", "are required to prevent you know things", "52:18", "that are associated with aging like DNA", "52:20", "damage so if there's only so much of a", "52:22", "micronutrient around which where is it", "52:24", "gonna go is it gonna go where the you", "52:26", "know it's gonna preventing a damage", "52:28", "which doesn't make a difference until", "52:29", "five or six decades later or is it gonna", "52:31", "make sure you live on to pass on your", "52:34", "genes and you know reproduce and so my", "52:37", "former postdoctoral mentor dr. Bruce", "52:39", "Ames sort of proposed this whole and he", "52:41", "has published a couple of foundational", "52:44", "papers supporting this idea which is he", "52:47", "calls triage theory so he's saying that", "52:49", "basically he thinks actually a lot of", "52:51", "RDAs are too low and that you know", "52:53", "optimal RDAs will it account for you", "52:55", "know how much is needed for these long", "52:57", "term functions so that's really", "53:00", "important to consider with the vitamin c", "53:02", "um you know it's it's it's really a", "53:05", "small amount that's needed to be used as", "53:09", "a cofactor for you know an enzyme for", "53:11", "you know collagen production you", "53:12", "actually don't need that much and it was", "53:14", "not like studies were done years ago", "53:16", "with that establishment like ten", "53:18", "milligrams of vitamin C was enough to", "53:20", "prevent scurvy which can happen when", "53:22", "you're basically don't have enough", "53:24", "vitamin C for collagen production and", "53:26", "and even that's kind of questionable", "53:29", "because back at the time when those", "53:30", "studies were done it was before really", "53:33", "good analytical assays were available so", "53:35", "you know the assay that was done to", "53:37", "measure various things were it was lots", "53:41", "of things could confound so it's me you", "53:43", "may even be less maybe more maybe less", "53:45", "it's kind of unknown so um you know that", "53:49", "that that is something to consider as", "53:51", "well as the fact that basically there's", "53:53", "a lot of biological variation with", "53:55", "vitamin C requirements and this has been", "53:57", "shown in other animals that also require", "53:59", "by them and see like guinea pigs so like", "54:01", "if you take one hundred guinea pigs and", "54:03", "this is you know this is published back", "54:04", "in like 60s or 70s like there was like", "54:07", "tenfold variation in how much each of", "54:09", "them required vitamin C they required", "54:11", "even though they were given like yeah so", "54:14", "ten tenfold yeah so there's like huge", "54:16", "variation in the half-life of vitamin C", "54:18", "and in their transporters and you know", "54:21", "so this has been shown in rodents as", "54:23", "well rodents make vitamin C in their", "54:24", "liver but the same things been shown and", "54:27", "actually back when the the European", "54:29", "sailors were getting scurvy and dying of", "54:32", "it only about fifty percent only about", "54:33", "half of those sailors got scurvy the", "54:35", "other fifty percent didn't have any", "54:37", "symptoms know how under ward diet guys", "54:39", "not getting scurvy well that's that's", "54:41", "what I'm saying I'm saying that you know", "54:43", "for one it doesn't take much right right", "54:46", "they're getting some of it from me yeah", "54:48", "yeah so so the thing you know if it's it", "54:51", "doesn't take much to to maintain the", "54:55", "enzymatic function of some of the some", "54:58", "of the enzymes involved in making", "54:59", "collagen and that you know it doesn't", "55:01", "take much for that but the question is", "55:04", "about what about you know all the host", "55:06", "of other factors yeah and the", "55:07", "neutrophils and you know your body", "55:10", "stores like orders of magnitude more", "55:12", "vitamin C than then then it needs for", "55:14", "that for the", "55:15", "it's function as a cofactor and it's", "55:17", "like you know why does it do that is it", "55:18", "just because maybe during scared food", "55:20", "scarcity you want and wants to make sure", "55:22", "it has enough or is there are you know", "55:23", "the antioxidant functions and other", "55:25", "functions really important or other", "55:26", "unknown functions so I think the vitamin", "55:29", "C you know there's certainly you know", "55:31", "getting enough to prevent scurvy and", "55:34", "there could be biological variation in", "55:36", "that as well", "55:36", "right you don't need much to prevent", "55:38", "scurvy and again you're dealing with a", "55:40", "very small sample size you don't know", "55:41", "how many people are actually on this", "55:42", "diet or supplement according right how", "55:45", "many of them are supplementing and why", "55:46", "wouldn't they be right yeah exactly and", "55:49", "you think that a lot of these issues", "55:51", "could be prevented with just", "55:52", "multivitamin and supplementation well I", "55:55", "mean I think the best thing is to get it", "55:58", "from food wash well yeah yeah you know", "56:01", "so that the there's another one that's", "56:02", "potentially risky and that is vitamin E", "56:04", "which kind of vitamin E helps recycle", "56:07", "vitamin C and vitamin C helps recycle", "56:09", "vitamin E and vitamin E actually most", "56:12", "people think of as an antioxidant which", "56:14", "it does it prevents a lot of oxidative", "56:16", "chains it's kind of breaks the chain of", "56:18", "oxidation but it also is really", "56:20", "important for maintaining cell integrity", "56:22", "and that's how the RDA was chosen for", "56:24", "that one so um how does it do that so", "56:27", "it's it's important for inside the cell", "56:29", "membrane so it's a it's important and", "56:31", "Alex at inside the cell membrane and so", "56:32", "it's preventing a lot of oxidative", "56:35", "factors that are happening just from", "56:36", "normal metabolism normal what's", "56:38", "happening you and I are doing it right", "56:39", "now", "56:40", "do you know damage that damaged our DNA", "56:42", "it also damages the the lipids in our in", "56:45", "our cell membranes and so and I so if I", "56:47", "didn't mean II it plays a really", "56:49", "important role in the integrity of it", "56:51", "and so the experiments that were done", "56:53", "for choosing the RDA for vitamin E were", "56:57", "two and a half years long and men were", "56:59", "given three milligrams of vitamin E so", "57:02", "the RDA is 15 milligrams so they were", "57:05", "given three and after two and a half", "57:07", "years they started getting hemolysis of", "57:09", "their red blood cells because their red", "57:11", "blood cell the membranes of the red", "57:13", "blood cells weren't being maintained", "57:15", "very well after two and a half each of", "57:17", "two and a half years it's a long time", "57:18", "for you know for this to show up and so", "57:21", "for whatever reason it was decided that", "57:23", "having hemolysis happen lower than", "57:26", "twelve percent is okay twelve percent", "57:27", "was the cutoff", "57:28", "and so that when they did the repletion", "57:30", "studies it was 15 it was actually 12", "57:32", "milligrams and then for the AAR and they", "57:34", "went up to standard deviations and found", "57:35", "15 basically the RDA was at 15 so the", "57:40", "question becomes well alright so vitamin", "57:42", "e you can you know you can get some", "57:43", "vitamin E if you're getting some egg", "57:45", "yolk and butter and if you're eating", "57:47", "some fish but you're not gonna it's", "57:48", "really hard to get 15 milligrams from", "57:50", "from those sources and and then if", "57:52", "you're eating that what about all the", "57:53", "other stuff you have to eat to get your", "57:54", "other you know so what is a good source", "57:56", "of it not so really really the best", "57:59", "source like almonds like 100 grand 100", "58:01", "Rams and almonds would like give you", "58:02", "your RDA a really good source so so the", "58:08", "question becomes well okay you know you", "58:11", "know what happens if I'm only getting 7", "58:13", "milligrams a day is it going to take you", "58:16", "know 6 or 7 or 8 years before my cell", "58:18", "membrane integrity is compromised more", "58:20", "you know what you know so it's just", "58:23", "there's a lot of important questions to", "58:25", "think about you know and it's like these", "58:27", "RDA is you know that I would even argue", "58:30", "they're set to low in some cases where", "58:32", "you're they're really trying to just", "58:34", "prevent things like you know that are", "58:35", "like hemolysis of the red blood cells", "58:37", "and you know so what about all these", "58:39", "other long-term effects", "58:40", "you know enzymes that are involved in", "58:42", "DNA repair for example and another one", "58:44", "would be like fully", "58:45", "folate you can get if you eat you know", "58:48", "if you're eating like 150 grams of a", "58:50", "like cooked beef liver every day but", "58:52", "like who does that you know I mean and", "58:54", "if you're not doing that and you're", "58:55", "eating you got to eat like your 48", "58:56", "sardines to get your vitamin E and you", "58:58", "got it you know so it's like it's not", "58:59", "easy and you know I'm not saying you", "59:01", "can't get you know some amounts of it", "59:04", "but you may not be getting the RDA and", "59:06", "so you know folate plays a very", "59:08", "important role in actually making new", "59:10", "DNA you know if you don't have Foley you", "59:13", "essentially incorporate something from", "59:15", "RNA called uracil into DNA and all your", "59:17", "like DNA you know polymerase is and", "59:20", "stuff for cruising along DNA and see it", "59:21", "and they make a nick in the DNA and it", "59:23", "literally you know it's a it's a nick", "59:25", "it's like in your in your DNA and if you", "59:27", "have it DNA is double-stranded so if you", "59:29", "have it on two ends the DNA what you do", "59:31", "because it's really important to make", "59:32", "one of the nucleotides thymine then you", "59:35", "know you're gonna have a double-stranded", "59:36", "break and actually my former", "59:38", "postdoctoral mentor dr. Bruce Ames", "59:39", "published a study showing that if you", "59:42", "animals and make them deficient in", "59:45", "folate or give them really really low", "59:46", "levels of folate it causes strands and", "59:48", "their DNA just like being irradiated", "59:50", "like you compare them side by side it", "59:51", "was the exact same thing and then he", "59:53", "published a study that was with humans", "59:57", "showing that actually humans that are", "59:58", "getting really low levels of folate also", "60:02", "had a certain type of DNA damage called", "60:03", "micro nuclei you know so the question is", "60:06", "well you know if I if I'm getting only", "60:10", "so much folate you know is is it's", "60:13", "something happening to my DNA am I", "60:14", "getting strand breaks the same goes for", "60:16", "magnesium I mean you can get magnesium", "60:18", "if you're eating you know this it's just", "60:20", "then what about the full day and then", "60:22", "what about the bottom inning but you", "60:23", "know so it's really hard it's really", "60:26", "hard to do that and DNA damage that's", "60:30", "something you can't measure you're not", "60:32", "gonna go your lipid panel isn't going to", "60:34", "tell you that there's no consumer test", "60:35", "available there was a few years ago as a", "60:38", "start-up try doing it but it's really", "60:40", "hard because there's if you're sending", "60:43", "blood samples you know to a lab to be", "60:47", "tested for DNA damage I have done on", "60:48", "many DNA damage experiments on humans so", "60:51", "clinical studies I was involved in dr.", "60:53", "Ames lab and I've done studies kinetic", "60:55", "studies where we took blood out of a", "60:58", "patient measured DNA damage immediately",

because", "61:08", "it's being exposed the you know oxygen", "61:10", "and all that is creating basically DNA", "61:13", "damage so anyways the point is is that", "61:15", "DNA damage isn't something you're going", "61:17", "to measure you don't feel it and you're", "61:20", "not gonna feel it I mean it's happening", "61:21", "in us right now", "61:22", "we don't know how many but it is we have", "61:24", "enzymes that are repairing that damage", "61:26", "and those enzymes require magnesium", "61:28", "we're getting enough folate to make sure", "61:30", "that that damage isn't happening and", "61:32", "again you can get a good amount of", "61:33", "folate liver is one of the best it's a", "61:35", "really great source but you have to eat", "61:37", "it every day and you have to eat like", "61:38", "you know I guess 150 grams of livers not", "61:41", "that much but you have to eat it every", "61:42", "day you know so it's it's just really", "61:46", "important to consider these you know the", "61:48", "fact that these micronutrients are", "61:49", "important they have long-term effects I", "61:51", "mean the two and a half years it took to", "61:53", "show the the hemolysis and rub let's", "61:55", "of two and a half years so what happens", "61:57", "if you're getting a modest amount not", "61:59", "quite three milligrams but you're", "62:00", "getting twice that or maybe you're", "62:02", "getting nine you know what happens seven", "62:04", "years from now like you don't know it's", "62:06", "and it's important it's your health it's", "62:08", "important so I think that so those you", "62:11", "know and there's a variety of other", "62:13", "Macanese you can also get if you're", "62:14", "eating a lot of like a stomach lining", "62:17", "tripe", "62:18", "so it's called tripe yeah I mean so it's", "62:20", "not like you can't get it but they are", "62:22", "not most these people that are carnivore", "62:24", "diet or just eating beef right and", "62:26",

mean", "62:42", "you can get vitamin C from spleen I", "62:44", "think heart so there's some organs", "62:47", "vitamin C when you cook it 25% of you", "62:50", "know it's lost so that's why a lot of", "62:53", "the muscle meat and stuff it does start", "62:55", "out with vitamin C but when you cook it", "62:56", "I mean if you're not eating it raw then", "62:58", "you know you're definitely it's", "63:00", "negligible here's one young guy who is a", "63:03", "carnivore diet proponent that seems to", "63:06", "be approaching this in a much more", "63:07", "comprehensive way he's really

this", "64:03", "stuff from food if you were going to get", "64:05", "magnesium fencing right but", "64:08", "is it feasible that you could just", "64:10", "supplement with multivitamins and and",

do with the fact that we", "65:43", "microbiome is really important so you're", "65:44", "getting you know the fermentable types", "65:46", "of fiber that are really important for", "65:48", "you know

other important thing are the", "66:36", "phytochemicals the the therapies", "66:38", "you know polyphenols flavonols flavonoid", "66:41", "all these things that are present in", "66:42", "plant the humans were we evolved eating", "66:44", "we evolved eating them you know so so", "66:47", "the the it's during throughout human", "66:51", "evolution you know humans were stressed", "66:54", "on many levels one they went through", "66:57", "moments of food scarcity where the", "66:58", "fasting came in I mean that's important", "66:59", "right now we don't have that we can get", "67:02", "food all the time anytime right so so", "67:06", "that was an important stress that humans", "67:09", "have evolved with exercise aerobic", "67:11", "exercise right that's another thing I", "67:13", "mean you had to you had to move to get", "67:15", "food and run from predators I mean so we", "67:17", "we evolved exercising now you can so", "67:21", "many people don't do that we also", "67:23", "evolved

the", "91:32", "the guy that I interviewed dr.

"92:18", "resistant spectra but without", "92:20", "inflammation there's that subtype and", "92:22", "then there's like another subtype or", "92:23", "it's like it seems like a big", "92:24",

"tons of biomarkers that are measured one", "92:45", "is the fasting blood glucose so should", "92:46", "be less than 5.5 actually gets hba1c", "92:49", "which is a three month mark or a fasting", "92:51", "blood glucose should be less than 5.5", "92:53", "fasting insulin should be less than", "92:54", "seven he's got your license", "92:57", "he reacted protein should be less than", "92:59", "0.8 and then he has a variety of other", "93:01", "inflammatory biomarkers that are also", "93:02", "measured and a variety by the things he", "93:05", "looks at a lot of different", "93:06", "micronutrients he looks at homocysteine", "93:08", "homocysteine is really important because", "93:10", "there's publications showing that if you", "93:13", "lower homocysteine it can act and act he", "93:16", "actually published this in one patient", "93:18", "it reversed the hippocampal atrophy", "93:19", "which is kind of amazing so there you", "93:22", "know it's not really known exactly what", "93:23", "the mechanism is but so that's something", "93:25", "he looks at and he does this diet this", "93:28", "like diet this whole lifestyle change I", "93:30", "mean people improving sleep exercise and", "93:33", "he gives him all sorts of vitamins", "93:34", "intitial", "93:34", "but on top of that he's this diet that", "93:36", "he it's kind of like to lower the", "93:38", "inflammation and improve the insulin", "93:41", "sensitivity and blood glucose and all", "93:43", "that where he puts them on a diet that's", "93:45", "kind of like he calls it keto flex but", "93:47", "it's kind of like a ketogenic diet", "93:49", "modified ketogenic diet but a lot of the", "93:51", "the fats are coming from like plant", "93:53", "sources so like avocado nuts olive oil", "93:56", "he treats meat as a condiment but and", "94:01", "and basically he's getting improvements", "94:03", "like with with this type of diet", "94:04", "lowering inflammation proving all sorts", "94:06", "of metabolic things so it's really it's", "94:10", "really interesting I've read a lot of", "94:11", "his studies because he publishes a lot", "94:13", "on Alzheimer's disease and mechanisms", "94:15", "you know and he's got a book out as well", "94:17", "where it kind of goes in-depth about it", "94:19", "so it certainly seems very interesting", "94:22", "that he's actually been able to not only", "94:25", "like delay Alzheimer's disease but", "94:27", "reverse it and this is how he has", "94:29", "published a couple of published studies", "94:30", "where people were able to go back to", "94:33", "work and actually in some of the in some", "94:35", "cases their brain atrophy kind of", "94:38", "stopped and it started to reverse where", "94:40", "they were like growing more neurons Wow", "94:43", "yeah so and I talked to him about this", "94:45", "and so the publication was like the", "94:46", "original one I had read which got me", "94:48", "interested in his work in the first", "94:49", "place when I saw that I was like holy", "94:51", "crap this is amazing it was only on ten", "94:53", "patients it was kind of low he says now", "94:55", "he's got like 50 more that there he's", "94:58", "getting ready to publish and then he's", "94:59", "you know got this whole protocol where", "95:01", "there's like just he's got like", "95:02", "thousands of patients where they're like", "95:04", "kind of treating this sort of individual", "95:06", "way they do genetic testing blood", "95:07", "testing and all that stuff as well so", "95:09", "it's very interesting", "95:11", "because it's you know he's basically", "95:13", "showing the important interaction", "95:14", "between diet lifestyle and potentially", "95:17", "genetics and this is kind of where my", "95:20", "paper comes in because there's a there", "95:25", "is a gene that increases the risk for", "95:28", "Alzheimer's if you have one copy of it", "95:30", "so you get two copies of every gene from", "95:32", "one from mom one from dad if you have", "95:34", "one copy of it or increases your risk", "95:35", "for Alzheimer's disease by like two to", "95:36", "threefold if you have two copies it", "95:38", "could be anywhere between ten and", "95:39", "fifteen fold so it's like really it's", "95:41", "called apoe4 it also increases the the", "95:44", "your chances of having a really poor", "95:46", "outcome if you have any type of TBI and", "95:49", "people with that that allele and have", "95:52", "TBI multiple TBI is definitely are much", "95:56", "more likely to come down with some sort", "95:58", "of nerve disease so but not everyone", "96:01", "with it gets it so there's like this", "96:02", "like what's going on here you know", "96:03", "there's there seems to be this clear you", "96:05", "know gene environment interaction going", "96:07", "on and so I was really interested in", "96:12", "this because I found out I had one of", "96:14", "these alleles and of course I got me", "96:17", "really concerned one of the things", "96:19", "that's really really important is sleep", "96:21", "because sleep is the one of the ways you", "96:22", "actually clear away amyloid plaques from", "96:25", "your brain your brain actually swells", "96:26", "during sleep you squirt cerebral finals", "96:30", "fluid into your brain and you basically", "96:31", "clean out a mold like plaques and a", "96:33", "bunch of other gunk that's you know", "96:35", "built up car wash for your brain when", "96:37", "you sleep yeah and I talked about this", "96:39", "with former guests here's dr. Matt", "96:41", "Walker we talked about it a lot", "96:42", "he's like him and I were to say it was", "96:44", "awesome I I just talked to his own mind", "96:46", "blower I love I love it I really love", "96:50", "the conversation I had with him so we", "96:52", "talked about this in detail because", "96:54", "basically that is one of the major ways", "96:57", "you you clear amyloid plaques but the", "96:59", "other way is through an AoE mediated", "97:01", "mechanism and apoe4 does it like 20 fold", "97:06", "less efficiently than someone that", "97:08", "doesn't have it and so they rely on", "97:10", "sleep and there's all sorts of studies", "97:11", "with a pre for showing sleep is a major", "97:15", "modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's", "97:17", "disease if you have a avoid for but", "97:19", "you're getting good quality sleep you", "97:20", "have like the same risk as someone that", "97:22", "doesn't have it and so I was like gee", "97:24", "you know", "97:24", "of course I was thinking about this the", "97:26", "entire time that had my son and I was", "97:28", "like not sleeping for months but anyways", "97:30", "the other thing that I looked into in my", "97:32", "publication this is where the another", "97:35", "sort of diet gene interaction comes in", "97:37", "is that there's all sorts of clinical", "97:39", "studies showing that people with April", "97:40", "before benefit from fish eating fish", "97:43", "where they can basically have improved", "97:46", "pathology in their brain have improved", "97:48", "symptoms of dementia but when they take", "97:52", "fish oil if you take fish oil and give", "97:53", "it to two people with dementia only the", "97:56", "people without April we for benefit for", "97:58", "some reason the April reef where people", "97:59", "aren't benefiting and if you look into", "98:01", "the literature animals that were given", "98:03", "human April before versus human April", "98:06", "III the DHA doesn't get transported", "98:09", "across the blood-brain barrier very well", "98:12", "with 8.4 so it's like what's going on", "98:15", "there's some sort of transport defect", "98:17", "and DHA in the brain is really important", "98:19", "it's been shown to play an important", "98:20", "role in human studies but a lot of", "98:22", "animal studies and human studies has", "98:23", "been shown to to increase amyloid", "98:26", "clearance it's in humans it's been shown", "98:28", "to decrease tau tangles and also it's", "98:32", "really important for glucose uptake into", "98:35", "the brain because it regulates the", "98:36", "transporters glucose transporters what", "98:38", "was the second thing", "98:39", "tau what tau tangles so tau tangles form", "98:42", "inside of neurons and they disrupt a", "98:46", "process that's called microtubule", "98:49", "transport which is where basically it's", "98:51", "the it's the neuron system for", "98:53", "transporting fatty acids all sorts of", "98:56", "goodies energy to the to the synapse", "98:58", "where synaptic transitions happening tau", "99:01", "tangles basically disrupt that whole", "99:03", "thing amyloid plaques form outside of", "99:06", "neurons in the extracellular space and", "99:07", "they can disrupt synapse formation", "99:10", "they're thought to form as a protective", "99:14", "mechanism against viral fungal or", "99:16", "bacterial infections so it's kind of", "99:17", "like you know that that's the reason why", "99:20", "they're forming but it's just a matter", "99:22", "of clearing them out and also how your", "99:23", "how your brain is able to like deal with", "99:25", "the amyloid plaque burden and April", "99:27", "before is not able to deal with it very", "99:28", "well so the DHA transport thing is", "99:32", "basically what I what I publish is has", "99:35", "to do with the interaction between", "99:36", "different forms of DHA and", "99:38", "Buie there's two different ways that DHA", "99:41", "is transported across the brain one is", "99:43", "when it's like in a free fatty acid form", "99:45", "it's bound to albumin and it requires an", "99:47", "intact blood-brain barrier specifically", "99:50", "the outer membrane of the blood-brain", "99:52", "barrier needs to be intact and and", "99:54", "because it goes through passive", "99:56", "diffusion well if there's a disruption", "99:58", "in the blood-brain barrier then the gh a", "100:00", "isn't going to be transporting very well", "100:01", "in that form and it's been shown that", "100:04", "April before actually disrupts that very", "100:07", "thing the outer membrane the tight", "100:09", "junctions that bind the outer membrane", "100:11", "of the endothelial cells that line the", "100:13", "blood-brain barrier and so it's it's", "100:16", "quite possible that that is why DHA is", "100:19", "not getting into the brains very well in", "100:21", "April we for carriers there's another", "100:23", "way to get it in and this is through a", "100:24", "transporter that but that uses something", "100:27", "called lasso phosphatidylcholine DHA", "100:29", "which is a phospholipid form of DHA it", "100:31", "forms from phosphatidylcholine DHA the", "100:34", "transporter is called MF s dua and it", "100:36", "basically takes the DHA and flips it", "100:39", "down across the outer membrane into the", "100:42", "inner membrane of the blood-brain", "100:43", "barrier so it bypasses that outer", "100:45", "membrane and then it gets transported in", "100:46", "so if you look at

humans with with a variation", "101:01", "in that gene that makes it less less", "101:03", "active have get neurodegenerative form", "101:05", "of neurological disorders in", "101:06", "neurodegenerative disorders so it's", "101:09", "obviously very important you know to to", "101:12", "get DHA into the brain through that", "101:13", "mechanism well it turns out if you", "101:16", "consume DHA in phospholipid form you", "101:19", "actually form more of lyso", "101:22", "phosphatidylcholine DHA and that's", "101:25", "because basically where the DHA s are on", "101:28", "a phospholipid they're in multiple", "101:30", "carbons and and one of them can escape", "101:33", "lipase and the pancreas and so basically", "101:35", "you can form more of it okay but so", "101:38", "phospholipid form DHA is in fish but", "101:41", "it's really abundant in fish roe like", "101:43", "super abundant like thirty to forty", "101:45", "seventy percent of DHA that's found in", "101:48", "fish roe which are fish eggs a variety", "101:51", "of different", "101:52", "kinds are in phospholipid form and you", "101:55", "you consume that stuff you that's the", "101:57", "reason why and I'm talking about it i", "101:59", "order mine so you can like I get salmon", "102:02", "roe I like the salmon because it also", "102:03", "has asked to xanthine in it which ends", "102:05", "do you order it like is it bottled or", "102:07", "canned or something I order its frozen", "102:08", "frozen", "102:09", "yeah it's frozen I order it but you can", "102:11", "go into like a Japanese store you can", "102:13", "get flying fish roe you know that which", "102:15", "are much some people prefer those", "102:16", "because they're smaller and the texture", "102:18", "they don't like the salmon roe like the", "102:20", "Iker if you go to like a sushi", "102:21", "restaurant and you get like the like", "102:23", "fish eggs that come in like the seaweed", "102:25", "they're bigger they're bigger and they", "102:28", "kind of nice to use those for bait yeah", "102:30", "some people don't like them because it's", "102:32", "like squish it and it's like liquid", "102:34", "company great for catching rainbow trout", "102:36", "rainbow trout", "102:38", "yeah rainbow trout eats salmon eggs so", "102:40", "I'm so I'm basically you know that's", "102:43", "that's one way to get more phospholipid", "102:45", "form but also DHA consumed in like", "102:48", "triglyceride form which is what a lot of", "102:50", "fish oil is also forms it also forms DHA", "102:53", "lie so

because they were using a look like", "103:02", "the dose they were using was 2 grams so", "103:05", "maybe you need six grams maybe you need", "103:06", "four is there any negative benefit or", "103:08", "the negative consequence of consuming", "103:10", "too much fish oil well I think you know", "103:13", "it certainly depends on the type of fish", "103:15", "oil that you're consuming I mean if", "103:17", "you're consuming oxidized fish oil and", "103:19", "certainly not very good but why would it", "103:21", "be oxidized if it's last if it's too old", "103:24", "if it's too old and depending on how", "103:26", "they ice how what the isolation process", "103:29", "was but yeah too old for sure things", "103:31", "that are sitting around purification", "103:33", "process is very important implication", "103:34", "yes yes very important and like I said", "103:37", "there's that fish oil standards program", "103:39", "you can look up and there's a variety of", "103:41",

you", "104:20", "know so that was a high dose and that", "104:21", "was five years long pretty pretty a long", "104:24", "follow-up and it was a randomized", "104:25", "placebo-controlled study I think it was", "104:29", "called the vitals it vital it study but", "104:33", "you know the other thing that I think", "104:34", "people are worried about with really", "104:36", "high dose fish oil is the the potential", "104:39", "for blood thinning because it does", "104:40", "inhibit thromboxanes and prostaglandins", "104:43", "and leukotrienes and things that are", "104:45", "important for like you know clotting you", "104:50", "know I've been taking a really high dose", "104:52", "for like over a decade you know a fish", "104:55", "oil I've been taking not always 6 grams", "104:57", "but I've been taking a high dose for", "104:59", "quite a while and how often you get your", "105:00", "blood work done well recently I haven't", "105:02", "been getting it done very often because", "105:05", "I'm the pregnancy and breastfeeding and", "105:07", "stuff where changes things I try to do", "105:09", "it like it ideally like doing it once a", "105:11", "quarter but like a couple times a year", "105:13", "for sure that's what I try six months", "105:16", "that's that's good I think I think like", "105:19", "you know sometimes you can get super", "105:21", "obsessive by doing if you're doing it", "105:23", "like once a quarter you know but for", "105:25", "people that are not healthy I think", "105:26", "doing it once a quarter until they start", "105:28", "to get healthier get it all dialed in", "105:30", "right do you supplement with niacin at", "105:32", "all no I don't supplement with niacin", "105:36", "but I'm thinking about doing the", "105:38", "nicotinamide right beside you know", "105:40", "niacin can it that's been shown to like", "105:42", "lower LDL but get hired it the stuff", "105:46", "that causes the flushing right the stuff", "105:48", "that causes the flushing but also I", "105:49", "think that there were some problems with", "105:50", "it like disrupting insulin something", "105:54", "with insulin secretion I don't recall", "105:56", "it's been like so many years since I've", "105:57", "read those studies but the nicotinamide", "106:01", "rye beside forms nad so the niacin is a", "106:04", "precursor for for nad which is also", "106:07", "increased during fasting we were going", "106:09", "to get nad IV injections we still got to", "106:13", "do that Jamie that company contacted us", "106:15", "they there's two ways of doing it one it", "106:17", "takes eight hours", "106:18", "or - it takes like 10 to 15 minutes and", "106:20", "it's like excruciating yeah like the", "106:24", "pain", "106:24", "yeah they push it yeah they push it", "106:26", "through and it's just your your guts", "106:28", "feel like they're on fire for like 10", "106:30", "minutes", "106:31", "I want to try that just to see about it", "106:33", "that's the fast one yeah because it's", "106:38", "not happening", "106:39", "I'm not sitting around for eight hours", "106:40", "but apparently there's some significant", "106:42", "benefits to IV versions of it and doing", "106:45", "a Ben Greenfield was on the podcast", "106:47", "talked about it pretty much it pretty", "106:48", "in-depth yeah he's a big believer of it", "106:51", "yeah I couldn't find I actually tried", "106:52", "finding some published studies on the IV", "106:56", "version I really couldn't find any item", "106:59", "stuff - I'm pretty sure yeah you you", "107:01", "recommend it yeah I subscribe to that I", "107:04", "get that stuff every day", "107:05", "so that's and there have been published", "107:07", "study it clinical studies and he does on", "107:08", "that I take that stuff every day I like", "107:10", "it", "107:10", "yeah but I guess but the NAD by", "107:16", "intravenous method it's supposed to be a", "107:18", "much more potent form of it and the", "107:20", "people that I know that have tried it", "107:21", "like the guys that on it they get", "107:23", "someone will come down to their the on", "107:25", "it labs like a couple times a month and", "107:28", "a bunch of the employees will sign up", "107:30", "and get zapped so I wonder why some of", "107:34", "these guys - and certainly gathering", "107:35", "data and sort publishing because it'd be", "107:37", "nice - yeah it would be to see some data", "107:40", "on that yeah I wonder why", "107:42", "it you know a lot of times it's hard to", "107:45", "get funding for some of these things you", "107:47", "know you know who knows I mean it'd be", "107:49", "interesting to see if it has some of the", "107:50", "similar benefits at taking something", "107:52", "like nicotine of my tribe aside has yeah", "107:54", "where if you take like a high enough", "107:55", "dose you can you can raise your your nad", "107:57", "levels like dramatically how many of", "107:59", "those at least a.m. tablets are you", "108:01", "taking on a daily basis I stopped taking", "108:03", "them just right now while I'm", "108:04", "breastfeeding I'm just always on the", "108:06", "cautious side or I was taking I think I", "108:10", "was taking 250 milligrams I think each", "108:13", "pill is no mmm okay I don't I don't", "108:17", "remember", "108:17", "you know before I forget I did want to", "108:20", "ask you about it boom only dialing", "108:25", "circling back to this whole carnivore", "108:27", "thing one of those suggestions was that", "108:29", "it isn't is is it possible the", "108:32", "people that some small percentage of the", "108:35", "population would actually be allergic to", "108:37", "a lot of plants I mean there are people", "108:40", "that can be allergic to certain", "108:41", "components I mean there's there's the", "108:43", "whole nightshade you know family what I", "108:45", "think some people can like they have", "108:47", "allergic reactions to and I think that", "108:50", "people with nightshades being tomatoes", "108:52", "tomatoes and then I also people with", "108:58", "like got issues have you ever heard of", "109:00", "anyone being allergic also gut issues", "109:02", "would predispose you to being well", "109:04", "because you know there are other things", "109:05", "in the plans that can you know so things", "109:08", "people like to talk about like lectins", "109:10", "for example and you know lectins there", "109:13", "they are they are in a lot of plants but", "109:15", "they're much more concentrating seeming", "109:16", "like a legume like a bean MN and they're", "109:19", "inactivated with heat but typically most", "109:22", "people don't have reactions to to", "109:25", "selectins", "109:26", "possibly if they already have some sort", "109:28", "of gut barrier problem that could sort", "109:31", "of elicit a reaction but a lot of the", "109:34", "data out there is like in vitro where", "109:36", "lectins are used to stimulate the immune", "109:38", "system in vitro in fact I've used", "109:39", "lectins before to do an experiment but", "109:42", "you know so I think that yeah there's", "109:45", "there certainly food allergies or", "109:48", "[Music]", "109:49", "definitely a possibility and they do", "109:51", "exist so is it possible that someone", "109:53", "will be allergic to both cruciferous", "109:54", "vegetables and you know a bunch of other", "109:58", "like celery or cucumbers or things along", "110:01", "those lines", "110:02", "I don't know you know if they're", "110:03", "allergic to them maybe I think that", "110:06", "people can have you know with like a", "110:10", "variety of different issues like small", "110:12", "intestinal bacterial overgrowth and", "110:13", "their intestines you know people that", "110:16", "are that are sensitive to like FODMAPs", "110:18", "those things so woods fodmap toes", "110:22", "alright like i can't remember but the", "110:25", "basically people people can be sensitive", "110:28", "to them and they're usually people with", "110:29", "gut issues like right so it all boils", "110:31", "down to gut issues boils down to gut", "110:32", "issues and I in that there certainly is", "110:35", "some cruciferous vegetables like cabbage", "110:38", "or something can affect people they can", "110:40", "feel bloated and stuff like that yeah", "110:42", "absolutely but I do think that sometimes", "110:44", "resolving those good", "110:45", "shoes will resolve that problem I don't", "110:49", "I don't tend to think everyone's like", "110:51", "someone's gonna be allergic to every", "110:53", "plant I don't know though I mean you", "110:55", "know anything's possible right right but", "110:57", "no literature there's no there's no come", "111:00", "across any hmm but I haven't done an", "111:02", "in-depth search for that specific thing", "111:06", "so is it fair to say that when people", "111:08", "are describing this and they're saying", "111:10", "that it might be possible that there are", "111:12", "a small percentage of population where", "111:15", "there is a small percentage of the", "111:16", "population that's allergic to plants", "111:18", "that really what you're dealing with is", "111:20", "a small percentage of population that", "111:22", "has a significantly impaired gut biome", "111:24", "that is finding benefit to eliminating", "111:27", "these plants this strict elimination", "111:29", "diet being on this carnivore diet which", "111:32", "also has calorie restrictive aspects to", "111:34", "it and even fasting restricted aspects", "111:37", "to it that this is why they're", "111:39", "experiencing this positive benefit and", "111:41", "that perhaps one of the ways they could", "111:45", "fix their gut biome would be some sort", "111:47", "of prolonged fast or something along", "111:50", "those lines to try to fix the problem at", "111:54", "the root source instead of maybe what", "111:56", "the carnivore died would be is like some", "111:58", "sort of a dietary band-aid right and I", "112:01", "think that the study I was talking about", "112:03", "the 15-day in a minute faster where", "112:06", "people with autoimmune disease were", "112:07", "fasted for 24 hours every other day", "112:09", "mm-hmm", "112:10", "they had changes in their microbiome", "112:13", "that were in line very interesting", "112:15", "changes it they actually grew bacteria", "112:18", "that are you know very important for", "112:21", "producing things like butyrate which", "112:23", "makes you know helps make T regulatory", "112:26", "cells it's a signaling molecule that", "112:28", "helps your immune system produce more T", "112:30", "regulatory mean cells they don't", "112:33", "something that comes from state of", "112:34", "ketosis as well", "112:36", "well this yeah exactly they were fasting", "112:38", "yeah and it's the thing that was so", "112:39", "interesting and it's a question I had", "112:40", "had for so long was like what happens", "112:43", "the microbiome when you don't eat like", "112:45", "is it to start you know are you getting", "112:48", "like a selection for Meuse and degrading", "112:50", "bacteria which are degrading a certain", "112:52", "glycoprotein that lines the gut and you", "112:54", "know and the thing that was so", "112:56", "interesting about this study was that", "112:57", "they did this like meta genomic", "112:59", "analysis and they found from fecal", "113:00", "samples that he that the G like in them", "113:04", "within the existing microbiome it was", "113:06", "increasing the production of like ketone", "113:08", "bodies themselves and that was fueling", "113:10", "because your your gut cell like your gut", "113:12", "cells and also a lot of the beneficial", "113:14", "bacteria like things like butyrate", "113:16", "lactate propionate acetate you know", "113:19", "these are the some of the short chain", "113:20", "fatty-acids beauty rates like the big", "113:21", "wanted the gut for the gut like gut", "113:23", "cells like like 80 or 90% are like using", "113:26", "butyrate but fasting was like increasing", "113:28", "all these ketone bodies so it's kind of", "113:30", "really interesting because for one it", "113:32", "helped and it and it basically increased", "113:36", "the diversity of this beneficial", "113:38", "bacteria was very interesting i wouldn't", "113:41", "have guessed that", "113:41", "have there been nothing have there been", "113:43", "any studies on consumption of exogenous", "113:46", "ketones to benefit the gut biome not", "113:49", "that I'm aware of", "113:50", "I mean do you think that that would", "113:52", "mirror it anyway that's a very", "113:54", "interesting question because most of the", "113:57", "exogenous would be like a beta hydroxy", "113:59", "butyrate ester I don't the the question", "114:03", "would be how similar is beta hydroxy", "114:06", "butyrate to butyrate right computer", "114:08", "rates what what we're talking about and", "114:10", "that's a very interesting question I", "114:12", "don't know yeah I mean that would be or", "114:15", "even what what's happening during during", "114:19", "like a ketogenic diet as well right", "114:21", "you're making you have a lot of", "114:22", "circulating beta hydroxy butyrate is", "114:23", "that good does that get to the gut right", "114:26", "you know so that's that's another", "114:28", "interesting question yeah because it is", "114:30", "an interesting way to hack your system", "114:32", "is that these exogenous ketones like ki", "114:34", "Gen X or that's one that I use for a few", "114:37", "other companies that make these they do", "114:39", "put your body in a state of ketosis yeah", "114:41", "no I've definitely tried I've tried one", "114:44", "from from HB MN the beta-hydroxybutyrate", "114:48", "ester and I I it definitely like gives", "114:53", "me energy but the other thing I really", "114:55", "liked was the mental effects the thing", "114:58", "the the thing about it so couple there's", "115:01", "a sort of a double-edged sword because I", "115:03", "feel less anxious when I take it and", "115:07", "this was this is getting me up into like", "115:08", "you know 4.5 millimolar beta hydroxy", "115:12", "butyrate", "115:13", "like an hour mm-hmm um I feel Aleksei", "115:17", "chicks and more foot more in the present", "115:18", "like I'm more present and not like you", "115:21", "know a million things ahead whereas like", "115:23", "sometimes my brain goes right so I felt", "115:25", "like and and and this is something that", "115:27", "like like Dan observed with me you know", "115:29", "throughout this more than once I started", "115:33", "using it I started using I didn't use it", "115:34", "today but the reason why I didn't use it", "115:37", "today so I started using it like for", "115:39", "podcast or Bing talks or anything like", "115:42", "and the reason I didn't use it today is", "115:45", "because the flip side is it dramatically", "115:49", "because I'm not in ketosis I'm not on a", "115:50", "you know cue genic diet it lowers my", "115:53", "blood sugar levels like really", "115:55", "dramatically and this has been published", "115:56", "you know there's like mechanisms that", "115:59", "are trying to be explored to", "116:00", "understanding why that is and possibly", "116:02", "as a therapeutic treatment for type 2", "116:04", "diabetes like that but so if once the", "116:06", "once the ketones wear off which they do", "116:08", "after a couple of hours I crash because", "116:13", "my blood glucose is low and I don't have", "116:14", "the ketones there to compensate right", "116:16", "whereas if I was already in ketosis then", "116:19", "you know it wouldn't matter cuz I'd", "116:20", "already yeah so so yeah it's really", "116:26", "interesting the the effects on the brain", "116:28", "I don't you know it's something that I", "116:30", "noticed and I certainly like repeatedly", "116:34", "noticed what would be the mechanism", "116:35", "though it'll allow you to be more", "116:37", "present", "116:38", "that's it seems so strange that that", "116:39", "would you know less anxiety yeah I mean", "116:41", "what would cause that I don't know I", "116:44", "mean there's you know possibly the", "116:47", "glucose is being spared in my brain for", "116:49", "other things that's you know because the", "116:51", "now the ketone the beta-hydroxybutyrate", "116:53", "being used as a source of energy and", "116:54", "this is being used I mean glucose", "116:56", "bearing does occur a lot of times in the", "116:59", "in the context of making more", "117:01", "glutathione because that's glucoses can", "117:04", "be used for energy or can be used to", "117:05", "make glutathione and the pathway that it", "117:08", "does that through a pathway called the", "117:10", "pentose phosphate shunt and that pathway", "117:12", "takes glucose and make something called", "117:14", "NADPH which is then used which is", "117:16", "necessary to make wood a thigh own so I",

that glutathione", "118:19", "does is it helps your body process", "118:22", "alcohol correct I don't I mean it's a", "118:27", "very bland oxidant wasn't that what Mark", "118:29", "Gordon talked

was so the", "119:12", "best way to get it would be through so", "119:14", "far Fame so from broccoli sprouts", "119:16", "cruciferous vegetables and then your", "119:18", "body would produce more

because one of the things that", "122:33", "may be so yeah they say to take when", "122:35", "you're taking those ketone salts or", "122:37", "ketone esters or really potent ones is", "122:39", "to

you get it", "125:40", "from farm raised vegetables like stop", "125:43", "right but but it comes he's right in in", "125:46", "a way because it comes from the runoff", "125:47", "from animal feces right and that's how", "125:51", "it gets into isn't that the case I don't", "125:53", "know I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure", "125:55", "that's how it gets into the food fine if", "125:57", "that's true ecoli in vegetables comes", "126:03", "from animal agriculture Google that I", "126:07", "think that's true I've certainly had", "126:11", "some bad sprouts before store-bought I", "126:15", "was failing yeah I got sick you know and", "126:19", "also", "126:19", "from once we made at home you know you", "126:21", "it just if you have to be really careful", "126:23", "if you have too much water around if", "126:25", "it's too much heat and condensation and", "126:27", "all that bacteria grows because you're", "126:29", "eating it raw yeah exactly so when you", "126:31", "clean I mean how difficult is it to", "126:33", "clean did you find anything from manure", "126:36", "yeah be-caw yeah so it is right remnants", "126:40", "in general cattle in particular both", "126:41", "beef and dairy yep right so a lot of", "126:45", "these especially like a real organic", "126:47", "farm a lot of times they're there they", "126:50", "vary they have animals plants all sorts", "126:53", "of the stuff together and the runoff", "126:55", "from the cows gets under your broccoli", "126:58", "and all that jazz yeah it's nasty and", "127:00", "how do you clean that I mean if I you", "127:04", "know told you that ecoli was on your", "127:05", "vegetables you still want to eat them if", "127:07", "you clean them you eat that shit so how", "127:10", "do you clean your vegetables I rinse", "127:13", "them yeah but I mean right how good I", "127:17", "usually don't get I don't know if you", "127:19", "knew like that's the thing like when", "127:21", "people say oh you should clean your", "127:22", "vegetables okay but if there was e.coli", "127:25", "on those vegetables and you cleaned them", "127:26", "who did you think there'll be enough", "127:27", "probably wouldn't washing of greens", "127:30", "won't protect against e.coli consumed", "127:32", "there you go the heat kills e.coli and", "127:35", "other types of bacteria can make you", "127:36", "sick even greens that are typically", "127:37", "consumed brah such as romaine lettuce", "127:39", "can be cooked okay so e.coli is", "127:41", "destroyed at 160 degrees Fahrenheit", "127:43", "which is like seems like everything", "127:45", "trichinosis a lot of things killed at", "127:47", "one 160 so so but the broccoli sprouts", "127:52", "you don't you don't consume cooked no", "127:55", "because the enzyme that converts the", "127:58", "precursor into active sulforaphane is", "128:00", "heat sensitive is it it does it diminish", "128:04", "it significantly or kill it all together", "128:06", "significantly I mean you still there's", "128:08", "still some plus the the precursor that", "128:10", "you're that you know is important for", "128:13", "forming sulforaphane you actually have", "128:15", "bacteria in your gut and this is", "128:17", "something that doctor judge Fahey talked", "128:19", "about when I when I interviewed him he", "128:22", "was talking about there's certain",

actually get a", "128:31", "certain amount he also mentioned that", "128:33", "you can take mustard seed powder and", "128:36", "sprinkle it on top of your cooked", "128:38", "Brussels sprouts your sauteed kale which", "128:40", "is this is what I do because I eat", "128:42", "sauteed kale and so I also have eat raw", "128:44", "kale but mustard powder has the active", "128:47", "enzyme so you can consume that with it", "128:50", "okay", "128:52", "what's the other thing like I mentioned", "128:53", "the there are the supplements I'm taking", "128:56", "there is one out there also that is has", "128:58", "a lot of the precursor and some of the", "129:00", "enzyme and so you can get a modest", "129:01", "amount of and this is what was used in", "129:03", "in the most recent autism study it's", "129:06", "called AB McCall but the one is both a V", "129:09", "a and wait yeah a V M maybe a.m. yes", "129:16", "I've know AV AV M AC oh that one's that", "129:27", "one's probably one of the

but you cuz I keep", "141:46", "this keeps coming up is there any", "141:47", "beneficial difference between infrared", "141:49", "versus standard well a lot of the", "141:53", "studies that I refer to and that have", "141:56", "been published I've been using a", "141:57", "standard right and and they definitely", "142:00", "work differently I mean a standard", "142:02", "standard hot sauna or you're heating up", "142:04", "the air and you're so you're sure you're", "142:07", "getting hot whereas the infrared is like", "142:09", "it's like using it's like wavelengths", "142:11", "that are like you know stimulating", "142:12", "electrons that are sort of changing", "142:14", "things and heating up you from a", "142:16", "different sort of way so I do think that", "142:18", "the key is the heat stress itself that", "142:24", "personally I think that the the standard", "142:26", "is better why so because you get it's", "142:29", "easier to get more hot more discomfort", "142:30", "more heat stress it takes a lot longer", "142:33", "and infrared sauna to really heat up at", "142:35", "least in my experience they only go to", "142:37", "me like 140 or something Fahrenheit Oh a", "142:39", "lot of benefits come from like 180 and", "142:42", "you get up to like a 180 really okay", "142:44", "mine cranks I have to mine yours one out", "142:48", "here your regular you're hot yeah that", "142:50", "thing gets too fucking hot yeah it gets", "142:52", "to 200 all the time that's and I have to", "142:54", "open up the door yeah your ears start to", "142:56", "hurt and it's not even cut my feet hurt", "142:58", "again it's not even close to pegged like", "143:01", "in terms of like the the the full", "143:03", "temperature one I just have a really hot", "143:05", "one yeah so I think that heats really", "143:08", "important with one leg yeah exactly 180", "143:11", "for 20 minutes is where sort of like a", "143:14", "lot of studies published by like doctor", "143:16", "jari you are you lacking in in Finland", "143:18", "he's shown a lot of benefits he's a lot", "143:21", "of his studies have been observational", "143:23", "but he's also done some intervention", "143:25", "trials as well the observational says", "143:28", "we've talked about improvements and", "143:29", "cardio you know cardiovascular related", "143:31", "mortality I'll like literally like", "143:34", "people people do at four to seven times", "143:35", "a week they have like a 50% improvement", "143:36", "in cardiovascular rated mortality", "143:39", "three to four three to four times a week", "143:41", "or is it - yeah three or four times a", "143:43", "week to three times a week is like 24%", "143:45", "improvement it's like a dose-dependent", "143:47", "man or alzheimer's disease as well as", "143:48", "like reduced by like 60% if you do it", "143:51", "four to seven times a we", "143:52", "all cause mortality but he's also done", "143:54", "some intervention studies showing that", "143:55", "like there's improvements even a single", "143:58", "dose of doing the sauna improvements in", "144:01", "the ability of your your your blood", "144:04", "vessels to contract and expand with", "144:06", "pressure changes which is important so", "144:07", "it's like vascular compliance it's", "144:09", "called improvements in blood pressure", "144:11", "decreases in in

these are all intervention", "144:34", "trials as well people that are doing it", "144:37", "with before doing a workout which is", "144:40", "interesting so I've always done it", "144:41", "before yeah so so so doing it before", "144:43", "workout it reduced to late onset muscle", "144:46", "soreness doing it before workout which", "144:49", "is weird because 20 minutes before I", "144:51", "don't remember the exact amount of time", "144:53", "I think that it was a little bit of a", "144:56", "different protocol for that study I", "144:58", "can't remember off the top of my head I", "145:00", "did tweet it at some point but yeah it's", "145:04", "really interesting because I doing it", "145:06", "before seems like I'm so like after", "145:09", "doing the sauna it's like going into a", "145:10", "workout after that so maybe would they", "145:12", "have the same effects effects afterward", "145:14", "after you know doing it afterwards", "145:15", "possibly but what's super interesting is", "145:19", "the effects on the brain like have you", "145:21", "noticed do do you feel any feel great", "145:23", "yeah when I come out there I feel just", "145:25", "chilled out relaxed I feel I feel really", "145:28", "good I just feel good right that", "145:30", "alleviated that's exactly the reason I", "145:33", "even got interested in sauna was I that", "145:34", "was you know I was doing it regularly", "145:36", "and I started to notice that but I", "145:38", "recently met up with a researcher his", "145:40", "name is dr. Charles Ray's on I recorded", "145:43", "a podcast with him very interesting guy", "145:45", "but he devised this really cool like", "145:49", "gadget where he could elevate people's", "145:53", "core body temperature by like a degree", "145:55", "and a half but he had a tram control a", "145:58", "placebo so to speak and so so the", "146:01", "placebo did increase people's core body", "146:04", "temperature a little bit but not", "146:05", "to that amount not to that degree so", "146:08", "people thought they were getting the", "146:09", "active treatment they were never getting", "146:12", "anything he said when they had when", "146:15", "asked afterwards like 70% of them", "146:16", "thought they got the active treatment oh", "146:18", "so so yeah so it's actually a nice", "146:21", "placebo controlled study but what he", "146:23", "found was that even a single treatment", "146:25", "these were in people that had major", "146:26", "depressive disorder it improved", "146:28", "depressive symptoms like you've been a", "146:30", "week week after and this was just a", "146:32", "single you know exposure to the sauna", "146:35", "sauna it's not actually it's on it was", "146:37", "like this like heating device but um he", "146:40", "also measured their cytokine called il-6", "146:43", "which is something that's released from", "146:44", "exercise muscle tissue releases it", "146:46", "spills out into the bloodstream and it's", "146:49", "part of the inflammatory you know", "146:51", "response part of the inflammatory aspect", "146:54", "of exercise and in response there's a", "146:56", "whole anti-inflammatory effect and so", "147:00", "what he showed is that actually people", "147:02", "with more il-6 that happened the better", "147:04", "they had antidepressant you know effect", "147:07", "so it's super interesting because again", "147:10", "exercise does that in fact if you give", "147:12", "people NSAIDs or like you know so", "147:14", "non-steroidal anti-inflammatories and", "147:18", "before exercise it actually blunts the", "147:22", "il-6 production and it blunts some of", "147:24", "the positive benefits like insulin", "147:25", "sensitivity so aisle six although it's", "147:28", "an inflammatory cytokine it's kind of", "147:30", "like this sort of plio tropic one that", "147:34", "like it's released it's in muscle tissue", "147:35", "it's released and it seems to like", "147:37", "increase have a big anti inflammatory", "147:40", "response it happens in response to that", "147:42", "so it was really interesting because the", "147:44", "inflammation seems to be really", "147:46", "important for depression and that the", "147:48", "sauna was like you know basically", "147:50", "basically lowering markers of", "147:52", "inflammation so it's been shown to lower", "147:55", "C reactive protein and then also", "147:56", "increase aisle 10 so it's very", "147:58", "interesting kind of connection between", "148:00", "mood heat stress and then of course", "148:03", "exercise does the same thing exercise", "148:05", "does elevate your core body temperature", "148:06", "and heats you up and I asked dr. raisin", "148:09", "he thinks that things like the sauna hot", "148:11", "yoga hot baths steam room all those", "148:13", "things are pretty much can give you the", "148:15", "same effect the point is the heat stress", "148:17", "I'm pretty sure that yoga", "148:19", "the same in fact with hot yoga because I", "148:21", "have that same feeling when I get out of", "148:22", "a hot yoga class yeah this is like", "148:25", "really good alleviation feeling I just", "148:27", "my mood feels elevated I feel happier", "148:30", "and it feels different than a regular", "148:32", "workout like regular workout does that", "148:35", "but it seems more an alleviation of", "148:37", "stress like I've expelled the excess", "148:39", "energy in my body and I can relax and", "148:41", "there's certainly some sort of some sort", "148:46", "of a positive hormonal effect after it's", "148:50", "over you know some endorphin rush but", "148:53", "it's not the same as the yoga the hot", "148:55", "yoga I think is very addictive to people", "148:57", "and that's one of the reasons because", "148:59", "after it's over you feel amazing you", "149:01", "feel so good there's studies showing", "149:03", "that hot yoga does improve depressive", "149:05", "symptoms they're not you know you know", "149:06", "sham control I think there's a", "149:08", "researcher at Harvard public school of", "149:11", "health who is trying to develop they're", "149:12", "trying to do a study we're doing right", "149:15", "now", "149:15", "are they with or with a control right", "149:17", "there in the thing about yoga is that", "149:19", "it's only a hundred and four degrees in", "149:21", "the room but when you take into account", "149:22", "the extreme condition of like the", "149:26", "exercise extreme stress that you're", "149:27", "putting on your body a lot of it is like", "149:29", "really difficult balancing and you're", "149:31", "straining and all your mom you're", "149:33", "fucking sweating and you're not sweating", "149:35", "like 104 degrees you're sweating just", "149:37", "like you're sweating inside the song", "149:38", "right like big-time spice yeah yeah yeah", "149:40", "yeah like there's certain ones that like", "149:42", "when you do a balancing stick what I'm", "149:45", "standing in front of me like this I'm", "149:47", "watching you just pour off my arms yeah", "149:49", "just watching sweat drip off me I sweat", "149:52", "when I'm doing yoga like non what I'm", "149:55", "holding those positions with a non hot", "149:56", "environment mm-hmm you know so I haven't", "149:58", "I've done a Bikram yoga a couple of", "150:00", "times I've been the hot yoga a couple of", "150:01", "times I do really like it and had more", "150:04", "time right you see one minutes is a long", "150:07", "time yeah but but the endorphin you dump", "150:11", "a bunch of endorphins with the sauna as", "150:13", "well like tons and tons and then there's", "150:14", "the whole like you're making dine orphan", "150:17", "which is the sort of opposite of", "150:19", "endorphin responsible for that changes", "150:25", "some of the least in animal studies", "150:26", "Petronas to change your sensitivity to", "150:28", "end orphans", "150:30", "from the receptor standpoint yeah so", "150:32", "it's kind of interesting that's kind of", "150:34", "initially what I what I originally was", "150:36", "was looking into you when I was noticing", "150:38", "all these benefits from the sauna but", "150:40", "that's really cool that you're doing it", "150:41", "because there's so many studies now", "150:42", "showing that there's benefits on the", "150:44", "cardiovascular health", "150:46", "also on neurogenesis ease depression I", "150:49", "mean the anti-inflammatory effects as", "150:50", "well it's so easy to have it I mean to", "150:53", "have it right here and just to be able", "150:54", "to to get into the sauna anytime I want", "150:57", "I'm basically doing it every day that's", "150:58", "nice yeah right now I've been taking hot", "151:00", "baths just because I haven't where we're", "151:03", "trying to like get to the point where we", "151:05", "have a sauna but I think we're gonna get", "151:07", "there soon but hot baths have been", "151:09", "really doing it for me as well", "151:11", "where I'm like submerged my
