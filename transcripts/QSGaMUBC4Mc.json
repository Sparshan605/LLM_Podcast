["00:00", "mmm-hmm here we go four three two one", "00:05", "boom first of all before we get started", "00:08", "I want to say I love your reviews or my", "00:10", "favorite you you have the well you and", "00:13", "Lou I love Lou too but you you you're so", "00:16", "good at covering all the bases of", "00:20", "whether it's cellphones or any kind of", "00:22", "weird technology that's coming out and", "00:24", "you just you just nail it you just", "00:26", "you're so you're my go-to guy man well", "00:28", "thank you that's quite an intra I really", "00:31", "want to tell you like whenever as a new", "00:32", "cell phones out like I saw that you", "00:34", "walked in with the red but that's you", "00:36", "know that's not your daily driver now I", "00:37", "thought you would like this this is I", "00:39", "mean every phone knows is glass on glass", "00:41", "yeah but this this red hydrogen one has", "00:45", "a lot of weird stuff about it", "00:47", "it's first of all it's about twice as", "00:50", "big as it has to be but it's from a red", "00:52", "which is a camera company Wow all these", "00:54", "buttons yeah so buttons just a grip this", "00:58", "grip you can probably drop it from 45", "01:02", "feet in it we find throw it across the", "01:04", "room but the weird part is it's made by", "01:06", "red so red the camera company there I", "01:07", "use their cameras I love their cameras", "01:09", "but then they come out with this which", "01:11", "is a foam just kind of weird but green", "01:14", "yeah it's my foot actually so that's", "01:16", "next to the the iPhone 8 plus which is", "01:18", "already a huge phone what is this metal", "01:20", "thing on the back that brass looking so", "01:23", "it's like these pins and it's supposed", "01:25", "to next year support modules that will", "01:27", "connect to it so potentially the are", "01:31", "better camera bigger battery VR whatever", "01:35", "Reds decide to support or make hmm well", "01:38", "attached to it but it's also kind of may", "01:41", "or may not happen for a while yeah", "01:43", "because Jamie ordered one when did you", "01:44", "order one I paid for it blast I don't", "01:48", "know right went on sale yeah like last", "01:50", "August maybe I'm vaporware mine my", "01:52", "official one just ship that's a", "01:54", "prototype hmm this is a prototype you", "01:55", "have here yes seven I've worked with red", "01:58", "for I've seen a lot of the process since", "02:00", "I've gotten like eight software updates", "02:02", "and this is not final but like it's a", "02:05", "pretty good idea yeah what do you think", "02:06", "about it so far so I it's surprisingly", "02:09", "good a lot of people like new camera", "02:11", "companies or new companies come up and", "02:13", "make it", "02:13", "phone and it's just not right in a lot", "02:15", "of ways they kind of took a lot of notes", "02:17", "and they went in minimal with the", "02:18", "software I like that about it I was", "02:20", "expecting the camera to be amazing it's", "02:22", "they don't use they don't make this this", "02:25", "sensor so this the camera is not amazing", "02:26", "yet oh but I think the modules will make", "02:30", "this what it is I think the phone app by", "02:33", "itself is like not really $1300 phone", "02:37", "but it's support for upcoming things", "02:39", "that they're planning I think we'll make", "02:41", "it good is it a problem when a company", "02:43", "tries to get into this cell phone", "02:44", "business and you're competing with", "02:46", "Samsung Apple you know all right Huawei", "02:50", "there's so many companies that are so", "02:52", "advanced for you to be red who's", "02:54", "essentially a camera manufacturer they", "02:57", "make video cameras yeah really high-end", "02:59", "for people don't know really high-end HD", "03:02", "video cameras and a lot of movies are", "03:04", "shot on them films all kinds of things", "03:05", "to videos yeah oh you do all your", "03:08", "YouTube videos with it yeah is it really", "03:10", "that good for you I mean is it worth", "03:12", "having a red kit it's a large camera", "03:14", "right it's heavy yeah it started off not", "03:16", "that great and then I got used to it and", "03:18", "then they got better so it was probably", "03:21", "like five years ago that I first started", "03:23", "with a red a red scarlet this 4k 5k", "03:26", "camera and yeah it's kind of a pain but", "03:29", "the workflow has gotten better they've", "03:30", "worked with smaller teams like", "03:33", "individual creators even to get the", "03:36", "cameras now smaller it does more in a", "03:39", "smaller body so it's gotten a lot easier", "03:41", "to use a red for a small team whereas", "03:43", "like yeah five years ago they were", "03:45", "making a red for a movie shoot with 15", "03:48", "people use yeah yeah so how much they we", "03:51", "know uh I couldn't tell you a weight I'd", "03:54", "say probably between six and ten pounds", "03:57", "oh yeah because you it's completely", "03:59", "modular you rig it up to be what you", "04:01", "want so like you get that out the box", "04:02", "which is just the brain what we're", "04:04", "looking at for people just listening it", "04:06", "says red dragon on the side why is it", "04:09", "called itself red dragon and you got", "04:11", "some names pretty clutch looking it", "04:13", "looks like looks really like a computer", "04:15", "so that's what that's what you're", "04:17", "looking at is just the computer and the", "04:19", "sensor and that side piece right there", "04:20", "is the SSD reader everything else all", "04:23", "those pins you see on the top and on the", "04:25", "side that's where you connect", "04:27", "you want to make it the rig so if you're", "04:29", "doing this eight years ago you would", "04:31", "attach a viewfinder you'd attach a", "04:33", "couple monitors for directors you would", "04:35", "attach controls more yeah all this", "04:39", "follow focus all this the the lens", "04:40", "obviously the mount all this stuff has", "04:42", "to attach to it but for just me and my", "04:45", "use I'd use it more kind of like what", "04:46", "you might see in another image which is", "04:48", "just a monitor an SSD a controller and a", "04:51", "lens and that does everything so is the", "04:53", "idea eventually that this phone is going", "04:57", "to be able to do everything that that", "04:58", "does so that I think if you asked read", "05:01", "they would say yes but they aren't there", "05:06", "yet obviously how could they release", "05:08", "something and not have an amazing camera", "05:11", "yeah that seems crazy that that I think", "05:13", "is what I think a lot of people were", "05:15", "super hyped about cuz obviously Reds", "05:17", "good with not just the they make the", "05:18", "silicon for the camera but they're good", "05:20", "at color science and autofocus and all", "05:23", "these different things that camera", "05:24", "should be good at so when they come out", "05:27", "with a phone that has a camera on you", "05:28", "just kind of expect it to be amazing", "05:30", "yeah it's not the best I kind of firmly", "05:32", "believe this is the best camera and you", "05:34", "have that's the Google three yeah is the", "05:37", "best camera in a phone are you a Google", "05:38", "pixel fanboy at this point I'm a fan I'm", "05:41", "a fan of the camera Roche has turned me", "05:43", "into a fan of the rest of the phone just", "05:45", "the camera alone it's it's an unusual", "05:47", "camera in that it only has one one", "05:48", "camera yes yeah there's one camera where", "05:51", "everybody else is going with multiple", "05:53", "cameras three for Google's doing", "05:55", "everything with software yes and I like", "05:57", "that about it now is that the excel", "05:59", "let's see excel it's it doesn't seem", "06:02", "that big it's kind of not that insane I", "06:05", "think everyone's everyone's into the", "06:06", "notch obviously which is a little", "06:08", "different from what you might see in a", "06:10", "iPhone or a huawei phone or something", "06:13", "but this software is very googly the", "06:16", "screen is much better than last year its", "06:17", "glass of wireless charges got all these", "06:19", "things that last year's phone didn't", "06:20", "have but the camera is absolutely what", "06:23", "makes that phone good it's really that", "06:25", "much better it is that much better what", "06:27", "is so good about it it's like you said", "06:30", "it's the software so what Google does", "06:32", "with HDR and essentially their image", "06:35", "processing is a big part of why it's", "06:37", "good you could put the same sensor in", "06:39", "glass", "06:40", "another smartphone with way weaker", "06:41", "software and it wouldn't look as good", "06:44", "but what they do with that that image", "06:46", "processing after it's it's a rolling", "06:48", "buffer of images so you can take it's", "06:51", "like instant shutter so as soon as you", "06:52", "press the shutter it's instant shutter", "06:53", "you freeze the motion the dynamic range", "06:56", "is great the detail is great and photos", "06:59", "are amazing I was amazed at the", "07:00", "low-light photos yeah those stunning cuz", "07:03", "I had the best I had seen before that", "07:05", "was the Huawei the mate RS I guess it", "07:09", "was there's been a couple really good", "07:11", "night modes in Huawei phones yeah but", "07:12", "this seemed even better than that and it", "07:15", "didn't seem distorted it seemed like you", "07:16", "realized it was at night but you could", "07:18", "see all the detail yeah it's hard it's", "07:20", "never gonna look as good as daytime but", "07:22", "there's a I haven't I don't have the", "07:24", "update yet but there's gonna be an", "07:26", "update to the pixel that has night sight", "07:28", "or another night mode that does the same", "07:29", "thing we're taking a bunch of exposures", "07:31", "and long exposures and use a", "07:32", "stabilization and hopefully get some", "07:34", "much brighter image that looks way", "07:37", "better than what would be different from", "07:38", "the update in in compares to what it", "07:42", "does now so right now if you just take a", "07:43", "photo at night it'll just try to noise", "07:46", "reduce all like when you take a photo at", "07:48", "night there's a lot of grain you're", "07:49", "pumping the ISO all the way up and when", "07:51", "you clean all that noise out you are", "07:54", "it's kind of like airbrushing the image", "07:56", "and it's gonna be softer so if you do a", "07:58", "lot of noise reduction you lose all your", "07:59", "detail it's really soft so low-light", "08:02", "photos just aren't as good but if you", "08:04", "can take a longer exposure with better", "08:07", "stabilization you can not crank the ISO", "08:10", "as high not introduced as much noise and", "08:12", "then at the end of the day have a more", "08:14", "detailed better looking photo so that's", "08:16", "the theory behind a lot of these night", "08:18", "modes how they do how do they do that", "08:20", "all in software a lot of calibration a", "08:23", "lot of knowing exactly how good the", "08:25", "optical image stabilization is in the", "08:27", "lens and then electronic stabilization", "08:29", "as well a lot of algorithms knowing what", "08:31", "part of the photo is moving versus what", "08:33", "isn't so there's a lot of computational", "08:36", "photography is what it's called", "08:37", "happening on the chip that makes it that", "08:41", "good it's just fascinating that Google", "08:42", "is the only one who's doing this with", "08:44", "one camera as opposed to everyone else", "08:46", "like my iPhone has several cameras yeah", "08:48", "I have a note 9 which I really like", "08:52", "and one of the other things about Google", "08:54", "this does not have a lot of RAM now I", "08:57", "found that actually kind of an", "08:58", "interesting weak point about this phone", "09:00", "and I haven't even I reviewed it and I", "09:02", "was kind of skeptical about its only", "09:04", "only four gigs of RAM just like a couple", "09:06", "years ago for teak sorry I'm on the", "09:08", "phone that's amazing it's amazing but a", "09:10", "lot of phones coming out now has six", "09:11", "eight gigs of ram well who has the most", "09:13", "right now a phone just a gaming phone", "09:15", "just came out with ten gigs of RAM so", "09:17", "the razor phone or a different no", "09:18", "another one I don't even remember the", "09:19", "name but then there's also a Oppo find X", "09:21", "with ten gigs of ram but do you know me", "09:24", "that no you know you don't need what", "09:26", "would what would be the benefit of", "09:28", "having 10 gigs of ram like what software", "09:29", "would run basically the advantage to", "09:31", "having more Ram is keeping apps open and", "09:35", "running in the background longer so if", "09:36", "you have your camera and your Twitter", "09:39", "and you're instagramming a web browser", "09:40", "and all that a lot of high and maybe a", "09:42", "couple games all running at the same", "09:44", "time and then you multitask and switch", "09:47", "between them on a phone with less RAM", "09:49", "you'll find that you'll switch from the", "09:50", "game to the browser and you go back to", "09:53", "the browser and it reloads everything", "09:54", "cuz it it completely garbage that from", "09:57", "the memory after a while because it was", "09:58", "trying to save space so on a phone with", "10:00", "four gigs of RAM this happened me a", "10:02", "couple of times where I'd be listening", "10:03", "to music and I'd opened the camera take", "10:05", "a few photos and then the music or the", "10:07", "podcasts or whatever would just stop and", "10:09", "it killed that app in the background", "10:11", "with only four gigs of RAM I'm not doing", "10:13", "that crazy things with multitasking just", "10:15", "two things running just to I think it", "10:17", "might have been a bug because the camera", "10:18", "uses a lot of memory and for whatever", "10:20", "reason it just picks the other big", "10:21", "memory app and kills it it's not very", "10:24", "repeatable I've had it happen to me", "10:26", "since I landed yesterday like a couple", "10:28", "times but it I think a phone with six or", "10:31", "eight gigs of RAM the last phone I was", "10:32", "using for a while was the one plus six", "10:34", "has eight gigs of RAM and I never", "10:37", "happened to me every time I multitask", "10:39", "and go back five ten apps ago and open", "10:42", "it it was right where I left off is the", "10:45", "Google pixel three your favorite phone", "10:47", "or is it just your favorite phone", "10:49", "because of the camera it is my favorite", "10:52", "phone period and it also has the best", "10:56", "camera and is it your favorite phone", "10:57", "because it has pure Google because you", "11:00", "have the Android it's the latest Android", "11:03", "which is kind of hard to find and", "11:05", "you get obviously this pure Google", "11:07", "experience and this amazing camera and a", "11:09", "great display and my priority isn't a", "11:10", "phone are pretty much along those lines", "11:12", "I need a great camera and then I want a", "11:14", "great display I want good software and", "11:16", "then the rest kind of follows and you", "11:18", "want pure Google right you don't want to", "11:20", "be operating under the Samsung skin I", "11:22", "don't mind I don't mind a skin if it's", "11:25", "good there's a lot of skins like oneplus", "11:28", "has oxygen OS and it's a skin", "11:30", "technically it's close to pure Google", "11:32", "but it's missing a lot of the pixel", "11:34", "features but it's fine it's smooth it's", "11:36", "great is oneplus running the latest", "11:38", "Android no no who is its actual phone so", "11:42", "one plus I think just got the Android", "11:45", "pee update essential just got the", "11:47", "Android pee update and then everyone", "11:49", "else is on like one version ago or a law", "11:52", "or older hmm why is that a pain in the", "11:55", "ass for them why can't it be Universal I", "11:57", "have a bunch of theories on why they", "12:00", "don't update their software as quickly", "12:03", "as they probably could I think a lot of", "12:05", "it in the US especially asketh carriers", "12:07", "when you have to get a so long you want", "12:10", "to push a software update to a phone on", "12:11", "Verizon for example not only do you have", "12:13", "to like rewrite the software and", "12:16", "optimize and everything but then you", "12:17", "have to submit it for like certification", "12:19", "from Verizon Verizon has to push that", "12:22", "update that whole introduction of the", "12:24", "third-party through the carrier is a", "12:26", "huge pain in the ass and then on top of", "12:28", "that I know a lot of people who when", "12:30", "they get a software update like actively", "12:31", "avoid installing it they just don't want", "12:33", "change in their phone hmm so at the end", "12:37", "of the day like they put all that money", "12:39", "and work into making a software update", "12:40", "and half the people never install it or", "12:43", "don't care then they just figure they", "12:45", "might as well not put the money there so", "12:47", "a lot of teams are a lot of", "12:49", "manufacturers just don't they don't they", "12:52", "support the phone for a year or two and", "12:54", "then that's it but for folks like you", "12:56", "for the power users that's big like", "12:58", "that's a big thing having the latest and", "13:00", "greatest definitely yeah that's why I'm", "13:02", "a fan of phones that keep the skin light", "13:04", "and update quickly which is what you'll", "13:06", "find with like pixel and essential and", "13:08", "oxygen OS and stuff like and that's", "13:10", "really it like Samsung takes a long time", "13:12", "to get to it yeah yeah as great as", "13:15", "Samsung phones are they definitely are", "13:17", "first to get a new software they're", "13:19", "trying to do it quicker apparently what", "13:20", "I've been reading but I guess there is", "13:22", "there's a bunch issues always a", "13:24", "bottleneck", "13:25", "yeah now when when you compare phones", "13:28", "like do you have a checklist of things", "13:31", "that you have like on a computer or is", "13:33", "it just all off the top of your head", "13:35", "like do you do you have like a rating", "13:38", "system that you use a personal rating", "13:40", "system I don't have a rating I do have a", "13:42", "like a like a checklist of things that I", "13:44", "definitely pay attention to every time", "13:46", "that I must say I go through screens", "13:48", "displays and battery life mm-hmm how", "13:51", "good the camera is and things like that", "13:52", "but I never come to like rating out of", "13:55", "whatever I used to do that a long time", "13:57", "ago but I stopped because I just it's", "13:59", "kind of like a never-ending you'll never", "14:01", "you'll never get a 10 out of 10 it's", "14:04", "really because if you ever give", "14:05", "something a 10 out of 10 the next one's", "14:07", "gonna be better right so how do you how", "14:10", "do you put that on the scale so I'm for", "14:12", "October 2018", "14:13", "yeah I guess you'd be like this is the", "14:15", "best phone like I said if I say this is", "14:17", "the best phone right now then maybe", "14:18", "that's a it's not a 10 out of 10 but", "14:20", "it's like the best you can get but that", "14:22", "line just keeps moving so I don't give", "14:24", "things numbers but see for me those the", "14:26", "things you said that would be a pain in", "14:27", "the ass that your music would shut off", "14:29", "because you're using the camera that's", "14:31", "yeah kind of big that's a pain yes yeah", "14:33", "it's not a 10 out of 10 because of I", "14:35", "think the memory is a problem yeah the", "14:38", "notch is bothering some people it", "14:39", "doesn't bother me anymore it just kind", "14:41", "of blends in I don't really look at the", "14:43", "notch so have you gone into the", "14:45", "developer settings and fucking down", "14:47", "removal of the knotch", "14:48", "I tried it it wasn't that big a deal", "14:49", "yeah it just makes a big black bar over", "14:52", "the top", "14:53", "exactly and you just lose the screen you", "14:55", "paid extra if that seems silly yeah I", "14:56", "don't mind it on the iPhone I most of it", "14:59", "mostly I use the XS max but I'm so sour", "15:03", "on Apple because of what they did with", "15:05", "the batteries yeah that was such a dirty", "15:08", "thing to me because everybody had always", "15:11", "suspected like my friend Brian was", "15:13", "always like dude I'm telling you when", "15:14", "the new phones come out your old phone", "15:16", "starts moving slower Mike that's a", "15:17", "conspiracy that's all horseshit yeah", "15:19", "your phone's just old bro but then when", "15:21", "I found out that it was real I was like", "15:23", "you assholes and it's pretend the", "15:26", "problem was the way they didn't tell", "15:28", "people like they could have just a", "15:31", "avoided like the whole whatever like PR", "15:33", "we want whatever going to call it by", "15:34", "just telling people look this is what we", "15:36", "do on your phones getting older we need", "15:38", "to preserve either the CPU or the", "15:40", "battery so we need to either voltage", "15:42", "down the CPU or save your battery pick", "15:45", "one and give us a choice they didn't", "15:46", "tell us until people started suspecting", "15:48", "things and they had to make a statement", "15:50", "and then it looked kind of dirty and", "15:51", "like hidden that I don't buy it yeah I", "15:55", "think it's a trick to try to get you to", "15:56", "buy new phones I don't know there's no", "15:58", "way they didn't think about that yeah", "16:01", "why else would they do it that way why", "16:03", "would why else wouldn't they just let", "16:04", "the battery be slower or they let the", "16:07", "the the CPU be slower and the best part", "16:09", "is they give you the choice now but if", "16:11", "you never look for it you'll never find", "16:13", "it and they definitely still default to", "16:15",

supposed to go", "18:24", "okay yeah that actually makes sense", "18:26", "maybe this is better but your experience", "18:29", "often says the opposite so that's why", "18:31", "people like to not

more travel", "23:44", "yeah you might think it's like an", "23:46", "upgrade if they went backwards yeah yeah", "23:48", "goofy I don't know how they did that", "23:52", "yeah but they're so design oriented I", "23:56", "mean everything looks stellar that's", "23:58", "what it is Apple has been not a victim", "24:02", "of their own desire to make great design", "24:05", "but they often very often make", "24:08", "compromises sometimes to the detriment", "24:10", "of how good a product can be to make it", "24:13", "look better", "24:13", "mmm classic example was the Mac Pro the", "24:15", "little circular trash can looking Mac", "24:18", "Pro that came out yeah I need 12 or", "24:20", "something like then", "24:22", "they kept they made all these promises", "24:23", "it's this sleek

actual performance even", "25:05", "though the CPU is more powerful was not", "25:06", "as good as the last model right that", "25:09", "which was lucky to make it look good", "25:11", "exactly", "25:12", "so yeah Apple has been a victim of their", "25:14", "own like desire to make things so", "25:16", "beautiful and then they got fucked by", "25:19", "Huawei cuz Huawei came along with the",

going on with firmware or", "30:18", "something going on with this or that or", "30:20", "I've gotten used to it mostly though", "30:22", "because most of what I do on my laptop", "30:24", "is pretty web-based so I'm just living", "30:27", "in Chrome or Safari or whatever so it's", "30:29", "not a big deal but then yet once I have", "30:30", "to go out and I'm gonna go in Lightroom", "30:33", "and

archaic pixelated", "31:00", "came from Vista", "31:02", "to Windows 7 to Windows 10 Vista was", "31:05", "kind of that nightmare and then they", "31:06", "kind of couldn't have worked upwards", "31:08", "then I started with Windows 95 I used to", "31:11", "make my own computers back in my", "31:12", "hardcore video gaming days nice I used", "31:15", "to go to Fry's Electronics and get", "31:17", "motherboards and locks and fans and I", "31:20", "started that online so I never went to a", "31:22", "physical computer store to buy parts but", "31:26", "I would have to do the whole like cross", "31:28", "cross-referencing what's compatible with", "31:30", "what online and then put together a", "31:32", "whole list and then just buy it and then", "31:34", "nine boxes show up and hopefully they", "31:36", "all work yeah but yeah there's the same", "31:38", "experience", "31:39", "yeah and SLI video cards and connecting", "31:42", "them with that cable and never mess up", "31:44", "and break one oh yeah yeah but fixing it", "31:48", "makes you feel like you did something", "31:49", "well there's something going on when", "31:51", "you're like the jumpers for the", "31:53", "motherboard and you're moving stuff", "31:55", "around and it's it is it was cool yeah", "31:58", "and then once you actually got online", "31:59", "with a computer you made yourself you", "32:01", "like this is yeah something about this", "32:03", "hmm and I remember when you used to be", "32:05", "able to do that with Apple you used to", "32:07", "be able to buy clones yeah I mean Mike", "32:10", "so I way back in the day still in high", "32:13", "school I had a Dell XPS like 730 I think", "32:16", "it was called this huge desktop where", "32:17", "again you could like take this CPU", "32:19", "cooler out put a new one in it was", "32:21", "modular fully and then Apple also made", "32:23", "this huge desktop this Power Mac mm-hm", "32:26", "or I don't know what it was called at", "32:27", "the time but it was again massive you", "32:29", "could take the graphics card out put a", "32:31", "new one in you could take the RAM out", "32:32", "take the CPU out but it was like this", "32:34", "this weird system where like they were", "32:36", "on like decks and you had to like chunk", "32:39", "like take this big metal slot out and", "32:41", "then do the CPU there and then put it", "32:42", "back in yeah it's really satisfying to", "32:44", "like change the hardware and like yeah I", "32:47", "did that and right now it's got eight", "32:50", "gigs around yeah

do with the two", "32:59", "yeah that's it one generation after that", "33:04", "cuz that hold that it had like basically", "33:06", "like elevator levels to it like the top", "33:08", "level and on the bottom level and on the", "33:10", "hard drives and the power supply on the", "33:11", "top like all that stuff", "33:12", "and you can mess with that if you go", "33:15", "over someone's house they have that now", "33:16", "you're like what the fuck is wrong with", "33:17", "you but that's the thing about like that", "33:19", "was the most accessible modular desktop", "33:23", "Apple ever

a modular", "34:11", "updatable real well designed Apple", "34:15", "desktop I'm like I really hope they're", "34:17", "doing that like exactly cuz that's I", "34:19", "love that do they have regular towers", "34:22", "anymore or no everything's in iMac they", "34:25", "had that that little trash can and then", "34:27", "the Mac Mini which is the longest since", "34:31", "they've ever updated it

true desktop", "34:41", "so everything is is that just because of", "34:44", "technologies advanced to the point where", "34:45", "you can kind of fit everything in the", "34:48", "big screen of an iMac basically yeah I", "34:50", "mean the the iMac they have those", "34:52", "desktop internals in it but yeah like", "34:56", "you're you're still gonna be restrained", "34:58", "by like how closed off that space is how", "35:00", "many fans I can fit in there so if they", "35:04", "really want to do like a true desktop", "35:06", "they gotta open it up and make it huge", "35:08", "which is not very like Apple so it's", "35:10", "gonna be interesting to see what they do", "35:11", "yeah", "35:13", "and when is your you at what year is", "35:15", "your laptop over there that's an older",

17-inch MacBook s' yeah the", "35:41", "big one the Mac Daddy these have a", "35:43", "laptop that was refurbish it and put a", "35:46", "like modern CPU in it they put a big SSD", "35:50", "drive like one terabyte or two terabyte", "35:53", "SSD drive so you deal with a solid-state", "35:56", "drive so it's instantly fires much more", "35:58", "RAM much more everything yeah that's", "36:00",

inch screen probably", "36:44", "to get away with what that's 12 inches", "36:46", "can you flip that around is a 12 a 13", "36:48", "inch screen but it's like a taller", "36:49", "three-to-two aspect ratio so it's not", "36:53", "like like the smaller 16 by 9 skin would", "36:57", "be underneath like where that guy was", "36:58", "hitting my screen so most of the bezel", "37:00", "seems like it's on the bottom", "37:01", "yeah yeah that's hear your chant the", "37:04", "bottom here I mean it's pretty pretty", "37:06", "good size bezel but like I'm still", "37:07", "hoping for like a bezel this laptops", "37:10", "like I'm what have you ever thought", "37:11", "about going with the wall way uh not", "37:14", "really mostly because I switch laptops", "37:17", "so infrequently that I was just like if", "37:19", "it's not massively better than the", "37:20", "MacBook Pro I don't really feel the need", "37:22", "to switch this came out on my radar in", "37:25", "the last like two weeks and I decided to", "37:27", "try it and it's been like worth the shot", "37:31", "like I'm really into it I'm probably", "37:32", "gonna switch back to the MacBook Pro in", "37:34", "a little while once I start to run up", "37:37", "against things like this doesn't have", "37:38", "USB C which is", "37:39", "mm-hmm that's weird that eventually", "37:42", "that's gonna bite me and when I do I'm", "37:43", "gonna want to switch back but it's like", "37:44", "a new Microsoft laptop that doesn't have", "37:46", "USB see doesn't really make a lot of", "37:48", "sense it doesn't at all why'd you do", "37:50", "that I have no idea no one asks right", "37:52", "it's a great laptop it doesn't have the", "37:55", "charger is this weird like it's not like", "37:58", "MagSafe but it's this like slot charger", "38:00", "thing where it like goes in and out", "38:01", "easily but also doesn't have a card", "38:04", "reader also doesn't have really like", "38:06", "yeah a lot of things that I kind of", "38:08", "hoped a laptop would have so yeah this", "38:11", "thing is everything this thing is", "38:12", "regular USB USB see this has one", "38:16", "horse-sized USB port a headphone jack", "38:19", "and what looks like this has HDMI yes", "38:23", "does not have I'm a big fan of this", "38:24", "thing and then they make a they make a", "38:26", "15-inch version of it as well this is", "38:28", "the I guess so what do you do like", "38:34", "mostly on the laptop stuff because", "38:35", "essentially writing writing and then", "38:37", "getting online just online bullshit", "38:39", "but yeah no software really I'm not", "38:41", "really running anything other than", "38:43", "writing programs Microsoft Word which is", "38:45", "native right yeah yeah I mean you could", "38:48", "probably get away with any number of", "38:49", "laps similar laptops just like so at", "38:52", "that point you basically like pick the", "38:53", "design you like best and if it has the", "38:55", "ports you need then you're good but if", "38:57", "you find yourself like if I'm a I like", "38:59", "to do photo editing a lot and so", "39:01", "basically I have to have some way to", "39:03", "read memory cards MacBook Pro doesn't it", "39:05", "just has a lot of us PC ports so I just", "39:07", "have that dongle plug in the USB card", "39:10", "reader and then I'm good", "39:11", "this one I'll have to get a USB card", "39:13", "reader also for it and then get", "39:14", "Lightroom and then I'm good you'll have", "39:16", "to get a regular USB card reader", "39:18", "yeah just like which is 12 years ago a", "39:20", "less common still easy to find but like", "39:22", "it's kind of dorky eventually it'll be", "39:24", "like 2020 and I'm like I don't want this", "39:26", "in 2020 yeah that razor pro the razor", "39:29", "blade pro that we were talking about", "39:31", "what's interesting about that is it has", "39:32", "a trackpad on the right hand side like a", "39:34", "mouse because if the mouse is on the", "39:36", "right yeah and then it has a sonorous", "39:38", "keyboard yeah and a mechanical keyboard", "39:40", "which I'm a really big fan of I like", "39:42", "those clicky with a true true desktop", "39:46", "replacement yeah look at that thing", "39:47", "yeah there's an acid plus look at all", "39:50", "the cool colors I have", "39:52", "the 15-inch with the the RGB they love", "39:54", "their RGB", "39:55", "I still that's your razor thing cuz they", "39:58", "have a phone now I don't know the rabbit", "40:00", "the razor phone - has RGB glowing", "40:03", "backlight it's hilarious but if that's", "40:05", "that's their own aesthetic but um what", "40:08", "does RGB stand for just red green blue I", "40:11", "like like the fact that you can cycle", "40:13", "between colors or whatever at any time", "40:15", "is almost almost pointless like it's", "40:19", "technically a backlight which is useful", "40:21", "but other than that you're just kind of", "40:23", "you know you get into the gamer", "40:25", "aesthetic which is pretty fun yeah it's", "40:28", "well it's it's a fantastic thing if", "40:30", "you're into games like that thing", "40:32", "literally you can play high-end games at", "40:36", "very high frame rates and you know I", "40:39", "don't know what kind of battery life it", "40:41", "has probably not that great it's a 4k", "40:43", "with so much juice and so much screen", "40:46", "and that's a so that's a fork a laptop", "40:49", "with a desktop GPU in it sighs a 4k", "40:52", "model versus a full HD mode model and I", "40:54", "think the 4k has a lower max framerate", "40:58", "so what is the difference in Full HD", "41:00", "model so I think it the full HD model is", "41:04", "a higher yeah 120 Hertz 1080p or", "41:06", "probably 60 Hertz 4k yeah so if you're", "41:11", "gaming you'll probably go with the 1080p", "41:12", "but then you get your higher frame rates", "41:14", "and you'll enjoy games better on that", "41:15", "but if your photo editing then you'll", "41:19", "probably go with the 4k and you get that", "41:21", "desktop power or video editing for", "41:23", "example but I don't think the battery", "41:26", "life will be very long on a 4k lap that", "41:29", "seems hard to imagine it's so big yeah", "41:32", "like find out what it says in terms of", "41:35", "the battery life like if you're just", "41:38", "playing a game and you're not plugged in", "41:39", "you're kind of far yeah if you're that", "41:41", "if you're that guy you're walking around", "41:42", "with the power cable all the time yeah", "41:44", "100% you're walking to a new room", "41:47", "plugging it in and then setting up there", "41:48", "yeah which is better than a desktop", "41:50", "technically but yeah you're walking", "41:52", "around with the power all the time yeah", "41:54", "better than the desktop technically but", "41:56", "is it as powerful as a desktop like if", "41:57", "you get a nice gaming desktop almost I", "41:59", "think their goal is to get as close to a", "42:02", "desktop as they reasonably can", "42:05", "and then give you the ability to take it", "42:07", "places quickly what does this say about", "42:10", "the fucking motherfucker disable every", "42:14", "web site ever everybody's pop-ups oh so", "42:18", "gross look at this world we live in now", "42:22", "why do I want notifications from your", "42:24", "website saw a great jiff", "42:27", "the other day am I saying that right", "42:28", "jiff of like every website where like", "42:30", "you go onto this you don't even get to", "42:32", "the content it's just three hours 52", "42:35", "minutes battery life for just watching a", "42:40", "movie", "42:40", "that's 100% you watch a movie and then", "42:44", "it's dead yeah that's hilariously low", "42:46", "yeah cuz if you watch a movie on a", "42:48", "MacBook Pro like you got plenty of juice", "42:51", "left after that movies over you might be", "42:53", "able to watch three or four movies", "42:54", "there's the battery 99 watt hour battery", "42:58", "hmm that's actually a huge battery but", "43:00", "still yeah that's one of the things that", "43:03", "I like about not this model of Lenovo", "43:06", "but some of the ThinkPads have a", "43:07", "swappable battery that you could swap", "43:09", "while that's a while it's on yeah Oh", "43:11", "what yes oh yeah he's able to do that", "43:14", "yeah that's do that where there's an", "43:16", "internal battery and there's an external", "43:18", "battery so you pop out the external but", "43:20", "which is a big thick band where you want", "43:22", "to get the full jammie that goes like 25", "43:24", "fucking hours yeah and if you pop that", "43:27", "sucker out you could do it while this is", "43:29", "still running you know it doesn't shut", "43:30", "off pop the new one in bang hot swapping", "43:33", "yeah hot swap it that I haven't had a", "43:35", "laptop with that since like like seven", "43:38", "years ago probably it's been a long time", "43:40", "yeah well I think think pads are mostly", "43:43", "business oriented and it's really mostly", "43:46", "what people are using them for yeah but", "43:48", "it's you know there's that balance of", "43:51", "like what are you looking for like are", "43:52", "you looking for something they can do", "43:53", "everything are you looking for something", "43:55", "that's just I mean most people for a lot", "43:58", "of people you could really get by with", "43:59", "one of those Google Chromebooks it", "44:02", "doesn't have much storage at all that's", "44:04", "where I'll probably end up getting my", "44:06", "parents into a lot like if your parents", "44:08", "or grandparents don't really need much", "44:10", "of a computer but all they need to do", "44:11", "really is email someone maybe go to a", "44:15", "website or to watch it online", "44:17", "movie you just need a web browser so", "44:19", "like a Chromebook is great yeah so much", "44:22", "is in the cloud yeah you know I mean so", "44:24", "many people keep their photos in the", "44:26", "cloud they keep it as long as you have", "44:27", "an internet connection you're good", "44:29", "you're good", "44:29", "but in terms of like local storage yeah", "44:32", "that's that's probably one of the things", "44:34", "about especially when I was talking", "44:36", "about this phone not only does it only", "44:38", "have four gigs of ram it also only has", "44:40", "64 gigs of storage that's it there's a", "44:43", "64 in a 128 and there's a lot of phones", "44:45", "now that have like 256 512 and then", "44:48", "expandable storage via microSD and the", "44:51", "reasoning Google is giving which I", "44:52", "actually subscribe to is everything just", "44:55", "goes through the cloud like the only", "44:57", "thing I keep offline is my Spotify", "44:59", "library and podcasts so my whole Spotify", "45:02", "whatever is like 30 gigs mm-hmm and then", "45:05", "whatever podcast I have is a couple more", "45:06", "gigs I don't need a 512 gig phone for", "45:10", "everything I usually keep offline I have", "45:12", "a couple big apps but not really and", "45:15", "then all the photos I take get uploaded", "45:17", "automatically to Google photos in full", "45:19", "resolution and I never really have to", "45:22", "keep all of them locally and so every", "45:24", "photo I've ever taken and full", "45:25", "resolution is on my phone even though I", "45:27", "only have 128 gigs of storage now when", "45:30", "you use the Google version of like", "45:33", "whatever iPhoto is iPhoto upload so", "45:37", "everything to the cloud it's really", "45:38", "simple when you get a new phone", "45:39", "everything loads up to it it's the same", "45:41", "thing happens this is good yeah and you", "45:43", "can use it on an iPhone which is you", "45:45", "don't have to but yeah real photos I", "45:46", "have Google photos on my iPhone so every", "45:48", "time I take great photos on this phone", "45:50", "there on my iPhone oh that is actually", "45:53", "not having the app is pretty useful", "45:54", "that's nice yeah and I know there's a", "45:57", "thing that's one of the things that", "45:59", "people really love about iPhones that", "46:00", "airdrop feature that's very nice yeah", "46:02", "that's one of the best in Apple only", "46:06", "features yeah but don't they have an", "46:07", "Android there's an Android drop too now", "46:10", "I know that because I've used it yes", "46:12", "send things from my Samsung phone to my", "46:15", "Apple phone possibly so there's it's not", "46:21", "like a first party thing so NFC is", "46:23", "useful when I want to send something", "46:26", "between two Android phones at NFC but", "46:29", "this is something I", "46:30", "recently I wasn't really using airdrop", "46:32", "until recently and then I was like oh", "46:33", "wait I do have a Mac and an iPhone I can", "46:35", "just transfer files back and forth and I", "46:39", "started doing that in the office a lot", "46:40", "which we have a bunch of Macs and", "46:42", "iPhones in the office so we started like", "46:44", "passing files back and forth and then", "46:46", "one day I was trying to do it on my", "46:47", "Android phone I was like wow this is", "46:48", "like a bummer I have to go into like", "46:50", "Dropbox and upload it and then download", "46:52", "it and it would just this couple extra", "46:53", "steps were a pain mm-hmm and it made me", "46:55", "really appreciate how good airdrop is", "46:57", "but Erdos pretty good it was really good", "47:00", "at making things super simple yeah like", "47:02", "you know you don't ever really have to", "47:04", "update things and until the OS updates", "47:06", "and it's pretty rare yeah everything", "47:09", "works really good you don't really even", "47:10", "worry about viruses or anything like", "47:14", "that yeah there's a lot they do that's", "47:16", "really excellent yeah but I feel like", "47:20", "they're running on the momentum of Steve", "47:23", "Jobs maniacal vision yeah there's been a", "47:29", "lot of apples changed or apples not the", "47:32", "same since since no more Steve which is", "47:35", "true obviously but they're also like", "47:39", "their momentum like how can you not like", "47:42", "they're insane they they're trillion", "47:44", "dollar company now they continue to make", "47:46", "iPhones that look the same that they did", "47:48", "nine years ago like why not you know and", "47:51", "if people keep buying them of course", "47:53", "they'll probably never have a reason to", "47:54", "change it's just a different kind of", "47:56", "company now before I mean he was like", "47:58", "Gen generally regarded as an asshole", "48:01", "like just a crazy yeah whip cracking my", "48:05", "can imagine yeah just just a nut like", "48:08", "there's that famous thing of him trying", "48:10", "to use I forget what the device was but", "48:12", "it wasn't used it wasn't working during", "48:14", "one on stage yeah I remember that and he", "48:16", "threw it yeah he's like it it was casual", "48:18", "but it was hilarious it was like it was", "48:20", "anger to it though well because someone", "48:22", "definitely got fired

attempts to figure out", "54:41", "how to put iMessage on Android phones", "54:43", "and that you you can get like some sort", "54:46", "of an app that allows you to use", "54:48", "iMessage isn't probably really clunky", "54:51", "and forty yeah yeah I haven't tried that", "54:53", "I haven't either I imagine it's horrible", "54:55", "yeah I have the note nine like I said", "54:58", "and I was thinking about switching over", "54:59", "to it and I was like I'll use this pen I", "55:01", "never use that pen once yeah that's", "55:04", "that's the thing as a reviewer I'm", "55:06", "always trying to figure out what is a", "55:09", "real genuine use it everyday feature", "55:11", "that's worth paying extra for and what", "55:13", "is a cool demo feature that will get you", "55:16", "to brag about the phone and show your", "55:18", "friends but you'll never use it yeah and", "55:20", "I've always been split on the s-pen is", "55:22", "that a thing people really use all the", "55:24",

"55:34", "try I try I had a this little point", "55:37", "where I was like yeah I'm gonna do", "55:38", "lockscreen notes every time I want to", "55:40", "remember something I'm gonna write it", "55:41", "down and I just never got into it", "55:44", "so like I'm usually pretty good about", "55:46", "like dividing things into buckets of", "55:48", "like yes this is something we will use", "55:50", "and is worth paying this is dumb", "55:52", "but it's really cool to demo and it will", "55:54", "just sell people and I never use it", "55:55", "again those two buckets are very clear", "55:57", "that yes pencil has been in the middle", "55:59", "the lockscreen thing is weird too", "56:01", "because it doesn't work that smooth the", "56:03", "lockscreen knows better yeah it's a", "56:05", "little clunky and then you don't just", "56:07", "get it right there it saves it to notes", "56:09", "you have to go to notes if you go to the", "56:11", "Notes app yeah yeah well I what my", "56:14", "thought was I'm gonna use this and I'm", "56:16", "gonna put my set list on my phone and", "56:19", "that where anytime I go to the", "56:20", "lockscreen the note set list should be", "56:22", "there I just be able to scroll through", "56:23", "my set list when I go onstage", "56:25", "yeah but it doesn't work not there no I", "56:27", "got to go to notes right what is this", "56:30", "then yeah yeah so it's just kind of", "56:32", "weird halfway there but I want to talk", "56:34", "to someone who's like yeah by the note", "56:36", "every year because I got to have the pen", "56:37", "like", "56:38", "that's gotta be out there this that's", "56:40", "what I think well one thing that is kind", "56:42", "of cool about it that I've never used", "56:43", "once but kind of cool about it is the", "56:45", "fact that you can use that pen as a", "56:47", "remote control that's definitely I take", "56:49", "photographs firmly in the second bucket", "56:51", "like great demo look I'm halfway across", "56:54", "the room taking a selfie that's cool", "56:56", "right yeah yeah then you'll never use it", "56:57", "I never use it and then also using it as", "56:59", "a remote control for music yeah and for", "57:02", "video you can map it to all kinds of", "57:03", "crazy things it's actually a really well", "57:05", "thought out feature it gets Bluetooth", "57:07", "and the S Pen has its own battery now so", "57:09", "you let the battery in the phone and it", "57:11", "charges the stylus very quickly in a", "57:14", "couple seconds you get like half the", "57:15", "battery like it's really", "57:16", "well-thought-out yeah", "57:18", "but am I ever gonna use probably not", "57:21", "yeah the battery is huge too it's got a", "57:24", "four thousand milliamp battery as", "57:25", "opposed to the iPhone which is what", "57:27", "thirty even the big ones like a 31 at", "57:29", "3200 is that that little yeah but I mean", "57:32", "like iPhones have never needed that the", "57:34", "number on paper to be big to be well", "57:36", "optimized because of software yes", "57:38", "but they've done tests where they did", "57:40", "benchmark test between the note and the", "57:43", "iPhone X what does it match a tenant's", "57:45", "10s max yeah it's not the the note", "57:50", "crushes it yeah yeah no Samsung is", "57:53", "getting better with optimization too", "57:54", "which is awesome that they crush it they", "57:56", "they used to be kind of scared of", "57:57", "batteries in the notes but they finally", "58:01", "gotten better at that and they're", "58:02", "they're doing really well it's amazing", "58:04", "that they bounce back from that at all", "58:05", "cuz people fucking died and then see I", "58:08", "don't think anyone died well some one", "58:10", "guy I don't know what happened to him", "58:12", "but there was a famous guy was a tech", "58:14", "guy who died because his battery", "58:16", "exploded in his house caught on fire and", "58:18", "he died in the fire", "58:19", "really I don't know what phone II was", "58:21", "using though he was some some I don't", "58:24", "think it was the note cryptocurrency guy", "58:26", "not follow the note pretty closely", "58:28", "because that was I had a couple of them", "58:30", "just because like I was in the middle of", "58:32", "reviewing it and using it I carried one", "58:33", "every day starts getting banned starts", "58:36", "getting caught on fire you can't fly", "58:37", "with it like I followed that all very", "58:39", "closely and all of you the cases of", "58:41", "because it started off with not only", "58:43", "were the notes sevens starting to", "58:45", "explode but they started recalling them", "58:47", "and sending people replacements and then", "58:49", "The Replacements started to explode", "58:52", "point I was like this is amazing I need", "58:55", "to follow this very closely uh he had a", "58:58", "blackberry and a Y way and they don't", "59:00", "know which one exploded probably one way", "59:02", "problems assassination I know has a", "59:06", "weird actually was a CEO it's a cradle", "59:09", "fund CEO nazrin Hasan mmm-hmm yeah and", "59:12", "it caught his whole house on fire yeah", "59:14", "he died after smartphone's pulled and", "59:16", "catches fire in his bedroom that is a", "59:17", "really extreme yeah yeah so that we're", "59:20", "to go they can't mess around so like", "59:21", "once that's when your phone starts", "59:23", "exploding and your Samsung like you have", "59:25", "to get you have to fix that there was a", "59:27", "famous video of the guy who parked his", "59:29", "car in the driveway and put his phone in", "59:31", "the charger and left it there and he", "59:33", "came outside to his car bursting into", "59:36", "flames", "59:36", "his whole car was on fire especially in", "59:41", "a gas car with right yeah luckily it", "59:45", "wasn't in his garage his driveway that", "59:48", "is no fuck yeah it's amazing they've", "59:51", "bounced back from that though because", "59:52", "they really have yeah", "59:53", "they're actually it's that's been", "59:54", "impressed with their reputation so like", "59:56", "in the reviewer community of like I", "59:58", "watch over all my friends videos about", "59:59", "the note when it came out we stopped", "60:01", "making explosion jokes this year I", "60:03", "noticed that like we the Galaxy Note 7", "60:05", "had all the explosion jokes note eight", "60:07", "came out all the explosion jokes", "60:09", "last year it exploded guys so what have", "60:12", "they done this year that's better now", "60:14", "we're on no nine and I think we're kind", "60:16", "of over it mmm two years that's how long", "60:18", "it well that's today though I mean did", "60:20", "this the short cycle of news today like", "60:23", "things come and go so quickly", "60:25", "but I wonder if that would have happened", "60:26", "to an iPhone mmm what kind of nightmare", "60:29", "that would have been I also think", "60:31", "there's probably no way it would have", "60:32", "happened to an iPhone like you would", "60:34", "think there's no way what happened to", "60:35", "Samsung but somehow it did but like", "60:37", "there's this whole process of like", "60:38", "getting a battery supplier for your", "60:40", "phone and then it's trusting their", "60:42", "quality testing and then using that", "60:43", "supplier for your manufacturing and all", "60:45", "that and I don't know how different that", "60:48", "process is for Samsung versus other", "60:51", "manufacturers like Apple but it just", "60:53", "seems like Apple would never let that", "60:55", "sort of oversight slip right hmm I", "60:59", "wonder but if it did how crazy would", "61:01", "that well samsung comes out", "61:03", "new phones way quicker right they so", "61:06", "they come out with phones more often but", "61:09", "they update their lineups at the same", "61:11", "rate like once a year for note mm-hmm", "61:13", "and also once a year for Galaxy S but", "61:17", "since they're six months apart it looks", "61:18", "like they made four new phones so we're", "61:21", "gonna get a new phone every April Galaxy", "61:23", "S ten will come out in April and then", "61:25", "they all get Galaxy Note in September", "61:27", "right well it's only six months well", "61:29", "that's part of a different lineup so", "61:31", "like galaxy s is every year galaxy knows", "61:33", "every year they have all these other", "61:34", "lineups so they make a lot more phones", "61:36", "for sure and are they still doing the", "61:38", "sport because they have that sport model", "61:40", "active yeah I think they are still it's", "61:43", "not nearly as special seeming to them as", "61:47", "it used to be they used to really like", "61:48", "put out separate commercials for it and", "61:50", "they they'd have like all this hype I", "61:52", "remember like galaxy s7 active was a big", "61:53", "deal yeah I don't even know if there is", "61:55", "a galaxy s nine active I don't believe", "61:57", "there is it was a rumor that it was", "61:59", "coming out and that it was gonna be", "62:00", "completely waterproof and shock", "62:02", "resistant it's gonna have a rubberized", "62:04", "case right and it was going to have an", "62:06", "enormous battery life that they haven't", "62:08", "released it the nine was gonna have the", "62:11", "same size battery as the note 9 but the", "62:16", "regular size 9 screen so four thousand", "62:19", "milliamp battery but in the s9 screen", "62:21", "right which would been massive yeah I", "62:24", "mean that's just that would have been", "62:26", "incredible I guess people just didn't", "62:28", "buy it as much yeah I don't think people", "62:31", "knew about it I think it's one of those", "62:33", "deals yeah I love battery life I'm", "62:36", "always scared that my phone's gonna run", "62:38", "out of battery I know it's ridiculous", "62:39", "cuz it very rarely does but I'm always", "62:40", "like fuckwit runs out of battery yeah", "62:42", "when I hear about like the iPhones", "62:44", "battery not being so good I like I've", "62:47", "heard that the the X s regular has", "62:52", "better battery life than the XS max", "62:55", "because the max has the larger screen I", "62:58", "think the I think they're about the same", "63:00", "I think a standby time on the 10 s max", "63:03", "is better because of the bigger battery", "63:05", "but when you do use your screen a lot", "63:07", "they kind of diminish down to the same", "63:09", "number I think and this iPhone 10 R", "63:12", "which I've just started using seems to", "63:14", "have a battery battery like them both of", "63:15", "them this is the less", "63:17", "this is the $750 IPS LCD version of the", "63:22", "iPhone 10 yeah the colors and all that", "63:24", "now how much of a factor is that in", "63:27", "everyday use do you notice the", "63:28", "difference battery life ya know that the", "63:30", "image quality not being as good with the", "63:32", "different screen yeah that's the only", "63:34", "factor right of the internal components", "63:36", "the same they are the same there's one", "63:37", "gig less of RAM", "63:39", "weirdly but yeah all the rest the", "63:40", "internals so what is a standard one have", "63:42", "six so four gigs of RAM in every world", "63:44", "I'm still yeah and then three gigs in", "63:46", "the 10r and then also one camera instead", "63:49", "of two and then an aluminum rail on the", "63:53", "side I call it a rail but the outside is", "63:55", "aluminum instead of stainless steel so", "63:57", "the iPhones got this shiny stainless", "63:58", "steel outside the yeah the screen is", "64:02", "still pretty decent I know everyone", "64:04", "likes to trash on it cuz it's only 8:28", "64:08", "it's like a 720p screen roughly this is", "64:11", "the are the are but like using it or", "64:15", "just looking at it it looks fine like an", "64:18", "Apple iPhone 8 yeah exactly it's the", "64:20", "same pixel density as an iPhone 8 which", "64:23", "is fine for most people so if you get", "64:25", "too caught up on the number which is not", "64:27", "the typical iPhone 10 our buyer then", "64:29", "it's gonna look bad but if you just look", "64:30", "at the screen and use it which is most", "64:32", "people walking in a store and just say", "64:34", "hey this looks fine and it's $250", "64:36", "cheaper I think I'll just get this one", "64:38", "that's my thing the 10r is gonna be a", "64:40", "great seller for Apple yeah it sounds", "64:42", "like it", "64:43", "now when you switch to those battery", "64:45", "pack cases that's now you have a brick", "64:48", "in your pocket that's huge yeah that's a", "64:51", "big phone already too so a 6.1 inch", "64:53", "screen on that 10 R and then this big", "64:55", "battery on the back yeah it's just gonna", "64:57", "be massive yeah I don't know I mean I", "64:59", "haven't seen any excess max with a case", "65:02", "that has a battery in it but cheese I", "65:04", "wouldn't even try but it's great if you", "65:08", "go on a trip somewhere and you might be", "65:11", "in some janky place that doesn't have", "65:13", "yeah like a travel version yeah it's", "65:19", "just big old brick case yeah", "65:23", "we're not a case person yeah you don't", "65:24", "have any cases online onto cases yeah", "65:27", "but you switch phone so often even if", "65:29", "you drop them that's one", "65:30", "pop a SIM card out I still take good", "65:32", "care of my phones people I call you get", "65:34", "a new phone every two weeks you might be", "65:36", "right but I still take really good care", "65:37", "my phones I actually did kind of getting", "65:40", "out of my car this slid out of my pocket", "65:42", "which is kind of a nightmare and it took", "65:44", "one bounce before I like sort of half", "65:46", "caught it so I got this little scratch", "65:48", "on the corner mmm that's a Google phone", "65:50", "Google phone but it's fine", "65:52", "so I always question people that don't", "65:55", "have cases like oh you're one of those", "65:56", "people my friend Andrew Santino he", "65:59", "doesn't put a case on anything and I he", "66:01", "didn't have like a good he was a more", "66:03", "design person he's like look how", "66:05", "beautiful this is one case in this", "66:07", "that's part of it but Neil deGrasse", "66:08", "Tyson had a really interesting", "66:10", "perspective", "66:11", "he said he takes his case and he flips", "66:13", "it around in his hand constantly and he", "66:15", "said if you go to like you watch like", "66:17", "cadets when they're learning how to", "66:19", "handle guns they're spinning their gun", "66:21", "around and catching a hose why do you", "66:22", "think they're doing that they're doing", "66:24", "that so that they're always able to", "66:26", "catch their gun no matter what you have", "66:29", "that they have so he takes his phone and", "66:31", "he flips it around his ham he's always", "66:34", "it yes like a cadet that's awesome my", "66:38", "phone and he showed me he was like", "66:40", "flipping in between his fingers like oh", "66:41", "I like see but that's him he's got this", "66:45", "next-level thought process behind", "66:48", "everything that's fair not having a key", "66:50", "so that means he's not a case person", "66:52", "he's always got his phone yeah that's", "66:53", "fine I a clear case and the reason why I", "66:59", "like it is because it's more grippy in", "67:01", "your hand just there's more to it I", "67:04", "phone Slippery iPhones are the", "67:06", "slipperiest phones they're the way", "67:07", "they're shaped they have the stainless", "67:09", "steel and then they kind of just melt",

"67:18", "obviously and the oneplus yeah you said", "67:21", "that that was your favorite phone before", "67:23", "the Google pixel 3 yep what why do you", "67:25", "like the pixel 3 better than that phone", "67:28", "cuz I've heard great things about the", "67:29", "oneplus yeah I love the oneplus still", "67:31", "and I would have no problem using it", "67:33", "today but this camera is so much better", "67:35", "than every other phone yeah now is that", "67:37", "because you take a lot of photos for", "67:39", "YouTube and blogging and that kind of", "67:42", "thing", "67:43", "yeah just

hour phone and is", "67:53", "in the 1 plus what I mean that the", "67:56", "Galaxy Note 9 is supposed to have a very", "67:59", "good camera as well I can't tell the", "68:01", "difference I'm not so you most people", "68:04", "won't until you put them next to each", "68:06", "other and then you kind of go oh", "68:08", "interesting there's a much like when you", "68:10", "put an iPhone photo next to a pixel", "68:13", "photo iPhones have notoriously great", "68:16", "cameras pixels have notoriously great", "68:18", "cameras you might be totally fine with", "68:19", "either one but if you put them next to", "68:21", "each other you will notice massive", "68:22", "differences between the photos yeah", "68:25", "so did you do this comparisons that are", "68:27", "online that we could pull up right now", "68:28", "my last one I compared a pixel 2 to", "68:32", "iPhone 10 to 1 plus 5t to 2 other phones", "68:38", "I did like a 5 camera blind test and", "68:40", "what I did was I put the five photos", "68:42", "next to each other but didn't tell you", "68:43", "which one is which maybe C D or E and", "68:46", "you go down the list and I have like 7 8", "68:48", "9 photos in a row ABCDE pick your", "68:50", "favorite one a lot of people went with", "68:52", "be a lot of people went with D and they", "68:53", "didn't know which one it was not the end", "68:55", "I revealed which one was which and a lot", "68:58", "of people were surprised by which one", "68:59", "that picked oh well I picked the pixel", "69:01", "over the iPhone every time really", "69:03", "interesting and a lot of times when you", "69:05", "put them side-by-side you'll notice like", "69:07", "iPhones like to boost the shadows a lot", "69:09", "more so that they're much more real it", "69:11", "yeah this is okay it's so like ABCD in E", "69:16", "which one do I like better hmm", "69:18", "and I already can tell immediately which", "69:20", "one is a pixel and you might not because", "69:22", "Iraq I remember pixel 2 had cooler", "69:25", "colors and more contrast than any other", "69:27", "one and it's a yeah so another thing", "69:32", "about these is it helps to see it in a", "69:34", "high resolution because the difference", "69:36", "in detail and sharpness between them is", "69:38", "another thing I paid attention to which", "69:40", "ones II I want to say that was the", "69:42", "oneplus but I forget no I'm pretty sure", "69:46", "B is the pixel cuz this great backpack", "69:48", "is starting to look a little bit blue", "69:49", "and I was a big characteristic of the", "69:52", "pixel - from last year right and that", "69:55", "was a big issue with the screen as well", "69:56", "right the to the", "69:58", "like so yeah look at this contrast like", "70:00", "you see like all these are like pretty", "70:02", "good but when you see B and you see how", "70:04", "much more contrast that has and you look", "70:06", "at a and how much it lifts in the", "70:08", "shadows yeah he's got he's got a pretty", "70:11", "even tone and he's also the one plus I", "70:13", "don't remember what he is I'd have to go", "70:15", "back to the video she switched him", "70:17", "around with everyone every time it was", "70:18", "the same a is the same every time B is", "70:20", "the same every time I know I'm I'm", "70:22", "already pretty sure that B is the pixel", "70:24", "go to it go to the top left one with the", "70:25", "selfie hmm so again like that gray", "70:31", "sweatshirt is starting to look blue and", "70:32", "be right in II look how much higher", "70:36", "brighter those shadows are like my black", "70:38", "hair looks kind of gray at that point in", "70:41", "that one so there's a lot of things you", "70:42", "don't notice until you put them side by", "70:43", "side hmm god that's so nitpicky they all", "70:47", "look so good they all look pretty much", "70:49", "like the same and see never see your", "70:51", "little poster up yes he is a little bit", "70:54", "tighter so I'm gonna go see is the", "70:55", "iPhone because the iPhone has has a", "70:56", "little bit of a tighter selfie camera a", "71:00", "lot of Android phones have a wider angle", "71:02", "selfie camera because he can fit more", "71:04", "people in them but Apple has always told", "71:05", "me they go with a tighter angle because", "71:07", "there's less distortion and they want to", "71:08", "feel more natural you just take a", "71:10", "picture of yourself and you look great", "71:11", "hmm here we go iPhone X No okay so you", "71:17", "know it to enhance oh boy I did add a", "71:19", "real camera into the into the mix have", "71:22", "my real camera was pretty fucking good", "71:23", "yeah I hope so it's $10,000 that's a", "71:26", "real

"was trying to test like the blurry", "71:49", "background versus an actual good camera", "71:51", "mm-hmm and whenever you look at these", "71:53", "portrait mode photos what they're doing", "71:54", "is they're sort of trying to outline the", "71:56", "subject keep it sharp and then blur the", "71:59", "background are definitely and year after", "72:01", "year they've gotten better at this", "72:02", "because the fall-off between the blur", "72:04", "isn't just like a cutout in real life", "72:06", "you get sort of like a gradient of how", "72:09", "much blur you have so a pixel too has", "72:12", "typically the sharpest cut out and the", "72:14", "best like separation between the", "72:16", "background where the iPhone kind of just", "72:19", "takes the face keeps the face sharp and",

that", "72:34", "one you really see how good the pixel 2", "72:36", "is yeah like that and 3 got better at", "72:40", "that actually yes so and now you can", "72:43", "change something note was doing last", "72:44", "year you can change how blur the", "72:46", "background is so I've known 10s now", "72:48", "pixel 3 Note 9 all of them you can", "72:50", "change how blurry the background is now", "72:52", "I notice you have an Apple watch on them", "72:55", "I do hmm that's smart watching the game", "72:57", "which is by a lot a lot yeah hmm that's", "73:02", "why I'm an iPhone person really

that's the", "73:13", "main number the main phone I usually use", "73:16", "and my iPhone of choice I carry because", "73:19", "there's still things that iPhones do", "73:20", "better and I always

hours", "74:19", "and all the stuff it does to pretty", "74:20", "clear yeah this I was talking to you", "74:22", "before the show about the sober October", "74:24", "fitness challenge we're doing is the", "74:25", "first time I've ever worn a heart", "74:27", "monitor and then the seen actual scores", "74:29", "yeah there's a real crazy motivating", "74:32", "factor of seeing an actual number the", "74:35", "game of gamifying of fitness is really", "74:38", "entertaining to me and it's what's kept", "74:40", "me like I've usually don't wear a", "74:42", "SmartWatch for very long but I think", "74:44", "it's been about a month and I just keep", "74:46", "like so there's a feature net where you", "74:47", "can challenge people to a one week long", "74:50", "challenge to whoever burns the most", "74:52", "calories and has the most points or", "74:55", "whatever is like a point system right", "74:56", "and that gamification of fitness has", "74:59", "been I think pretty special it's been", "75:01", "pretty good well this contest has been", "75:03", "really crazy with me and my friends so", "75:05", "what are you trying to do", "75:06", "well we if the winner is going to get a", "75:09", "belt like a WWE style belt nice it says", "75:13", "intergalactic sober October champion and", "75:17", "it has like marijuana leaf or the line", "75:20", "through it and a bottle of booze aligned", "75:22", "through it and you wear these things", "75:27", "it's uh it's called a my zone and it it", "75:32", "works with an app it works pretty good", "75:34", "and it registers your amount of your", "75:38", "heart rate the amount of calories you", "75:39", "burn and it gives you a point system and", "75:42", "the point system is I don't know what it", "75:44", "what they call its MEP ass I don't know", "75:46", "what it stands for but this the amount", "75:49", "of points over the month is what", "75:53", "everyone's shooting for right and so", "75:54", "today we're at October the 23rd so we", "75:59", "have 8 days to go and I have worked out", "76:01", "more in these 23 days than I have in", "76:04", "like the last six months and I'm not", "76:06", "exaggerating yeah I put in five and a", "76:09", "half hours yesterday hard I got more", "76:12", "than 900 points then after the podcast I", "76:15", "said fuck it we're gonna go for another", "76:16", "hundred and I worked out and I got", "76:18", "another hundred points put in another", "76:20", "hour", "76:20", "yeah it's maniacal because you see you", "76:23", "actually see the number and because I", "76:26", "can see the number I can see all my", "76:27", "friends numbers yeah and I'm Way ahead", "76:29", "so I'm what I'm just keep telling them", "76:32", "I'm twisting the blade because I'm so", "76:35", "far ahead like right now", "76:37", "fifteen hundred points away from", "76:39", "everybody else", "76:40", "Oberth trying to work out again that", "76:42", "slob so when you see somebody catching", "76:45", "up you're like oh I better hit the gym", "76:47", "yeah", "76:48", "and so I'm planning on staying so far", "76:51", "ahead that they must die", "76:53", "in order to beat me the iPhone or the", "76:55", "Apple watch when you have people", "76:57", "connected with the fitness part of it it", "76:59", "will literally notify me when one of my", "77:01", "friends has finished a workout and tell", "77:04", "me like how good their were how many", "77:05", "points they just got like as they finish", "77:08", "it like you hit the finish button and", "77:10", "you know everyone's getting a", "77:11", "notification yes that's interesting so", "77:13", "I'm gonna put in the extra four or five", "77:15", "miles on the bike so if they get that", "77:16", "notification that I did that and that", "77:18", "really does work yeah I mean there's no", "77:20", "doubt about it yeah", "77:22", "just having that external motivating", "77:25", "factor and then seeing a number there's", "77:27", "something about like with this with the", "77:28", "MEPS M EPS whatever the fuck that stands", "77:31", "for that stands for and I don't know how", "77:34", "the Apple watch measures points either I", "77:35", "think there's a because it's measuring I", "77:37", "mean there's a lot of sensors in this", "77:39", "thing so not only is a heartrate monitor", "77:40", "there's an accelerometer and a gyroscope", "77:41", "so it knows when you're standing knows", "77:43", "when you're moving quickly and I it", "77:46", "basically just comes up with a points", "77:48", "number at the end of the day I every", "77:50", "time I fly I just don't get any points", "77:52", "cuz I just sit there right but yet", "77:54", "there's like a live counter constantly", "77:57", "going of like you and your friends and", "77:59", "you got to have the highest number so", "78:01", "out of all the stuff that you do", "78:03", "different my own effort points that's", "78:05", "what it is that's the maps points but", "78:06", "here's the thing about that Maps points", "78:08", "and we were trying to figure out why it", "78:10", "does it gives you the same amount of", "78:12", "points for 80% of your max heart rate as", "78:14", "it does for 90 so like the first day I", "78:17", "said I'm just gonna sprint and try to", "78:19", "bury these guys so I put them in 90", "78:21", "percent for 35 minutes I was like they", "78:24", "can't do that I'm just gonna do some", "78:26", "shit they can't do but it doesn't give", "78:28", "you any more points for 90 percent 90", "78:30", "percent gives the exact amount of points", "78:31", "is 80% so it's they're unprepared", "78:33", "yeah I see those two they're fires piece", "78:35", "of shit so it's so dumb so I think the", "78:38", "reason why they did that is to keep", "78:39", "people from killing themselves that's", "78:41", "what I think yeah just get somewhere in", "78:43", "the 80 to 90 brain fat Burt is always in", "78:46", "the two and three fat Burt never gets in", "78:49", "yellow", "78:50", "that slob he's just bottled it around", "78:52", "waddling around with blue and green", "78:54", "mostly gray he gets a lot of gray he'll", "78:56", "get gray for hours just waddle and", "78:59", "complaining thinking about vodka", "79:00", "dreaming about food he's gonna watch", "79:04", "doesn't hit the gym I mean he's on the", "79:05", "gym right now he's a gym right now I'm", "79:08", "trying to catch up so he's playing", "79:11", "catch-up yeah the thing you just stay", "79:13", "ahead he's gonna stay ahead but yeah", "79:15", "when you fall behind in the distance you", "79:17", "think of them as wolves barking in the", "79:19", "distance chasing you like no fucking way", "79:21", "you're not eating me bitch wolves 10", "79:23", "miles away are not gonna get you but", "79:25", "wolves a hundred yards away they got to", "79:30", "keep the distance 10 mine way too far 10", "79:32", "miles it you want to hear you wanna be", "79:39", "saying at least just slob he's gonna", "79:40", "double everything I do look at that fat", "79:43", "face that's not even possible", "79:49", "stop I throw up", "79:51", "the dog he's so far behind it's", "79:54", "impossible to win but that's the point", "79:57", "the point is to keep the keep the boot", "80:00", "on his neck yeah this is this only does", "80:02", "seven-day challenges so you basically", "80:04", "like you get you start it and they", "80:06", "accept and then it counts for the next", "80:08", "seven days all your cumulative points um", "80:10", "well that would be good then you just do", "80:11", "four and you just keep going yeah you're", "80:13", "over yeah I like the challenge aspect of", "80:16", "it it's it's really I mean all jokes", "80:18", "aside it's been really fun yeah with my", "80:20", "friends poor Tommy bunts way behind know", "80:22", "what's going on Tom Segura is way behind", "80:26", "he's like 1,800 points behind storing", "80:29", "them up is he like saving a couple days", "80:32", "might be might be sandbags full strength", "80:36", "all day you sort you store them up and", "80:39", "you're in this device and then you sink", "80:41", "so you could pretend that you're not", "80:43", "doing any work", "80:43", "I could sandbag yes no one knows then", "80:47", "the last day you like you son of a bitch", "80:48", "I was online he's 10,000 points ahead", "80:51", "a real issue so the key is just keep the", "80:53", "work rate at an almost impossible level", "80:55", "so like yesterday like I said I worked", "80:57", "out five and a half hours and then", "80:59", "another hour yeah and today I've already", "81:02", "put in two hours and put in two hours at", "81:03", "7 o'clock this morning", "81:04", "so hotel room doesn't have any the thing", "81:07", "is I'm putting two hours in at yellow", "81:09", "I'm hitting 80% for two hours fat birds", "81:12", "out there waddling around with his dog", "81:14", "pretending he's working hard making", "81:15", "videos that's he's got like gray and a", "81:19", "little bit of blue he may be green a", "81:21", "little green and then he takes a break", "81:23", "cries lower than mine that's a fact I", "81:32", "worked out more yes last night and this", "81:35", "morning than he has in the whole day the", "81:38", "other thing notes that my problem when I", "81:39", "I play frisbee so I take the watch off", "81:42", "when I play because it's a wrist thing", "81:44", "I'm constantly like mute a play like", "81:46", "like that frisbee disc ultimate ultimate", "81:50", "frisbee yeah so I take it off every time", "81:52", "I play and I know that's thousands of", "81:54", "points that I'm missing out on what is", "81:55", "disc golf versus Ultimate Frisbee", "81:57", "different disc golf is what it sounds", "82:00", "like there is you play 9 or 18 holes and", "82:03", "you're throwing and walking up to the", "82:05", "frisbee no", "82:06", "are you throwing a frisbee yeah get an", "82:09", "air son so Ultimate Frisbee is different", "82:12", "ultimate frisbee you can think of as", "82:13", "kind of like football slash

throw anywhere but", "85:03", "they won't necessarily go downfield and", "85:04", "try to go score on someone because", "85:06", "they're not as tall or as explosive", "85:08", "meanwhile a lot of

look", "89:38", "around too much and then as soon as you", "89:40", "start to move and throw things everyone", "89:41", "else is trying to kill you", "89:42", "so and so you can sort of dodge

don't think I would", "91:11", "I don't think it would throw as many", "91:13", "punches in such a quick succession yeah", "91:15", "you'd be more worried about getting hit", "91:18", "back and actually getting punched but", "91:20", "when you're doing it's really", "91:21", "interesting", "91:22", "Wow no there's also the is this in the", "91:31", "button HTC vive - yeah this just came", "91:33", "out for all of them okay yeah the other", "91:35", "one the other one is called beat Sabre", "91:37", "and it's a you can think of it as like", "91:40", "guitar hero but you're holding like", "91:41", "lightsabers as well my kids love that I", "91:44", "got past you I love that and things are", "91:45", "flying that year and you're hitting them", "91:47", "yeah that that is a really

and this is", "91:58", "almost like South Park look at monsters", "92:01", "right yeah and they're like it's still", "92:04", "kind of cartoony but like your graphics", "92:06", "are crisp enough that you like feel like", "92:07", "you're a cartoon yeah yeah it's it's", "92:11", "really cool and you know like there's", "92:13", "actual physics to the arrow like when", "92:16", "you shoot it's like you have to lift", "92:17", "your arm up to get the arc of the arrow", "92:19", "correct to hit it things yeah you know", "92:22", "yeah it's good I so I I think about VR a", "92:25", "lot just because as a video maker you're", "92:28", "making content for the platform that", "92:30", "people view it on and we started to get", "92:32", "this little creeping up of like 360", "92:35", "videos getting really good and like", "92:36", "interesting applications of", "92:39", "360 video and it's still kind of early", "92:41", "and I don't really know if it's gonna", "92:43", "take off or it's it was just this like", "92:45", "medium stepping-stone format to what", "92:48", "might be a more immersive thing or maybe", "92:51", "just a are is gonna be way better I", "92:52", "don't I don't know yet but I pay a lot", "92:55", "of attention to it just cuz it's it's", "92:56", "new yeah", "92:58", "ar is fascinating as well I mean we", "93:01", "discussed what was it magic leap is that", "93:04", "what it was the Microsoft one that's the", "93:06", "other one hololens is Microsoft and then", "93:09", "magically does its own thing I haven't", "93:10", "tried either actually yet and which one", "93:12", "was the one where the ballerina was", "93:14", "dancing in your hand magic leap but", "93:17", "which one is that the one that people", "93:19", "are saying is kind of vaporware sort of", "93:23", "I would imagine that that screen on that", "93:26", "phone would have some sort of similar ID", "93:29", "technology it's like light-filled", "93:31", "technologies yeah talk about that doing", "93:33", "weird stuff with your eyes it's weird", "93:35", "so this phone has a what are they", "93:38", "calling it I'm not I'm gonna come", "93:43", "remember what they're calling it Oh sir", "93:44", "I need Wi-Fi for it actually it's got a", "93:47", "3d screen a glass is less 3d here's the", "93:52", "and you you basically has a 3d screen", "93:55", "and you look at media on it and it's", "93:58", "supposed to sort of pop out at the top", "94:02", "yeah", "94:03", "doesn't have to be lower case who's the", "94:06", "lower case no doesn't I want is it", "94:08", "this is t ballon yeah but basically it's", "94:15", "about it you can look like that but you", "94:18", "can't have things actually popping out", "94:20", "above the screen so things on the screen", "94:23", "will look 3d but anything like outside", "94:26", "of the screen won't it's kind of hard to", "94:27", "explain", "94:27", "Wow and so this is for video games or", "94:31", "for other things as well so at this", "94:33", "point in what they're trying to do is", "94:34", "have media like photos and videos pop", "94:39", "out like pop out so not just games", "94:41", "they're gonna have games as well but", "94:43", "they have shared with me a couple of", "94:46", "like media files that are like a good", "94:49", "use of the 3d and I'm curious what you", "94:51", "think of them because they're definitely", "94:53", "like a stretch what if I totally Gramm", "94:57", "me holla holla graphic is the word they", "95:00", "use but it's it's hard to explain and", "95:03", "it's kind of trippy whoa dude this is", "95:08", "weird", "95:09", "and there's there's different like so", "95:12", "there's a movie trailer version of it", "95:13", "where there's like things coming towards", "95:15", "you and I think that's maybe the best", "95:17", "use of it I've seen it's impossible to", "95:20", "show on camera I've tried many different", "95:21", "times no this will never show up on", "95:24", "camera this yeah this is odd yeah this", "95:28", "year like people have to make stuff for", "95:32", "this so any Content you have to shoot", "95:34", "for for view they call it for view or", "95:37", "they can take existing content and", "95:40", "convert it to for view but that's a", "95:42", "little less successful usually but the", "95:48", "cameras on the back they have two", "95:50", "cameras on the back and you can shoot", "95:51", "for view with the cameras on the", "95:53", "hydrogen it's crazy", "95:55", "well what I'm looking at right now is", "95:57", "topographic maps yeah Wow amazing man so", "96:04", "there's it's it's hard to tell again", "96:07", "like I try to separate things into", "96:08", "buckets of this is something you're", "96:10", "gonna use every day and love or this is", "96:12", "a total gimmick that you'll never use", "96:14", "again and I am me I started with it in", "96:16", "the bucket of this is kind of like a", "96:18", "gimmick but they've put so much", "96:22", "effort into making it good and all these", "96:24", "different conversion techniques and", "96:28", "let's see if I can find a clip but", "96:32", "they've they've been constantly changing", "96:33", "the algorithms and adjusting it and", "96:34", "updating it to look better that it's", "96:37", "starting to convince me that it might be", "96:40", "like worth paying attention to for more", "96:42", "than just the first two seconds this is", "96:47", "amazing what do you think you would like", "96:50", "use it all the time no never use it now", "96:54", "but still many but it's still pretty", "96:56", "cool it's it's very cool but how much", "97:00", "better is it than regular video that", "97:03", "that and how long can you like look at", "97:05", "it before your eyes started right tweak", "97:06", "a little yeah I'm already going like but", "97:09", "it looks good it definitely looks really", "97:11", "good it looks cool it's kind of", "97:13", "interesting yeah but so you can take you", "97:17", "can take photos and videos with the", "97:18", "camera on the phone that are in this 3d", "97:21", "and that's maybe the best use of it cuz", "97:23", "you can see like what's actually in the", "97:25", "room around you the way it would show up", "97:26", "in like a direct translation how much of", "97:29", "an impact does it have on storage size", "97:31", "uh not much I mean there's still video", "97:35", "files in there like big 4k videos but", "97:37", "they're not necessarily twice as big or", "97:40", "anything like that it looks cool but but", "97:44", "that video looks pretty cool too when", "97:45", "you go into the viewfinder and you go", "97:47", "from 2d to 3d then he can take photos", "97:50", "and videos of things in that format so", "97:54", "if you take if you take a capture and", "97:59", "then look at it and you kind of like", "98:01", "move the phone around a little bit it's", "98:02", "kind of like shimmery in a weird way but", "98:05", "kind of 3d sort of it's very hard to", "98:10", "explain yeah you'd have to look at this", "98:12", "through this thing like you would never", "98:14", "be able to show this to someone in the", "98:15", "video yeah exactly like I'm looking at", "98:17", "these plastisol little figurines and as", "98:21", "I move forward and backward you really", "98:24", "get a sense of 3d yeah that's a pretty", "98:27", "badass so I gotta figure out how to show", "98:30", "it in the video of like you can't I just", "98:32", "have to describe it use my words god", "98:34", "that's amazing", "98:36", "yeah and that's it well it's probably", "98:38", "coming that's probably coming it's", "98:39", "probably gonna be something we're all", "98:40", "gonna have to deal with yeah I'm", "98:42", "interested if you ask red they tell ya", "98:45", "it is the future everything is gonna be", "98:47", "like this I'm like you have to say that", "98:49", "there's my reading movies were a big", "98:51", "deal yeah get those stupid glasses and", "98:53", "yeah I mean that was so their claim is", "98:55", "like yes this is what's it's genuinely", "98:58", "good like you can use it in portrait and", "99:00", "landscape glasses let's 3d is usually", "99:02", "only one way or the other cause of", "99:04", "polarization so this is a lenticular", "99:06", "technology I don't know exactly how it", "99:09", "works but you can use it in portrait or", "99:11", "landscape you can play games with it and", "99:12", "things will react in depth of space on", "99:16", "in the game well the first video that", "99:18", "you show me is really interesting too", "99:19", "because it's essentially like a", "99:20", "topographic map yeah so it's like say", "99:23", "you're paying attention to depth yeah", "99:25", "you're looking at the layers of the", "99:27", "mountain and the hillsides yeah so it", "99:29", "yeah this actually was kind of weirder", "99:32", "like seeing these little figurines and", "99:34", "moving towards them in real life yeah", "99:36", "yeah that's what I think is that's the", "99:40", "best way to calibrate tier-i like what", "99:42", "it's doing around if you just look at", "99:43", "like a video of it you're like all right", "99:44", "it looks 3d like it's coming at me and", "99:46", "they had a couple like a movie trailer", "99:49", "type of thing we're like again like it", "99:52", "was mostly shot for this format and", "99:54", "things would like kind of go past you", "99:56", "and the speakers are also really good so", "99:59", "they have this sort of a 3d conversion", "100:00", "technique for audio as well where it", "100:02", "sort of goes behind you but yeah it's", "100:06", "definitely interesting yeah did you mess", "100:10", "around with Google glasses when they", "100:11", "first came out I did yeah yeah what did", "100:14", "you think okay this is this is gonna be", "100:15", "something I guess I probably did I it", "100:20", "was glass was weird it was ahead of its", "100:23", "time but also like not really yeah like", "100:25", "I I had it I was in college also so I", "100:28", "was like I can't wear it to class or", "100:30", "like walk around I guess I could walk", "100:32", "around Hoboken with it but the whole", "100:34", "idea of an augmented reality this little", "100:36", "screen that I could just check the", "100:38", "weather and then look back down or check", "100:39", "my text and look back down was like it", "100:42", "could be cool but also if you look at", "100:44", "someone wearing Google glass it's like", "100:46", "that guys wearing Google glass you", "100:47", "you can't get around it well people", "100:49", "would get angry at people for wearing it", "100:50", "had a camera filming me what are you", "100:52", "doing yeah yeah so that was another", "100:54", "thing as I tried I won't even say the", "100:57", "name but like another like much newer", "100:59", "version of that where again it was like", "101:00", "a small projection to a prism that would", "101:03", "you could see but no one else could and", "101:05", "it would fit into something that looked", "101:07", "more like regular glasses so had a", "101:09", "battery it had everything but it didn't", "101:11", "have a camera and you still had a screen", "101:13", "that you could look

showing it to me in the lobby and", "101:22", "immediately I was like that guys wearing", "101:23", "it I can see it I could feel a little", "101:25", "light in his eye I can see like that the", "101:27", "extra thick glasses so it was like it's", "101:30", "it's an interesting concept and I don't", "101:33", "know where it goes from here if it has", "101:36", "to be glasses based or if we'll", "101:38", "eventually have some sort of a chip in", "101:40", "or I or what the deal is what what the", "101:42", "next move is but it's a cool concept", "101:45", "yeah it's one of those things that sort", "101:47", "of it's kind of been flirting with like", "101:50", "for the longest time people thought", "101:52", "virtual reality was going to be I mean", "101:55", "there was virtual reality concepts 20", "101:59", "years ago yeah and people thought", "102:00", "virtual reality was going to be the", "102:01", "future and then it it took a long time", "102:03", "for the hardware to catch up I think", "102:06", "augmented reality has a more promising", "102:08", "immediate future just because it's more", "102:10", "useful yeah but the virtual reality has", "102:14", "like the immersion factor going for it", "102:16", "the problem is you have to make all you", "102:18", "have to make a whole world so augmented", "102:21", "reality is just like some layer on top", "102:23", "of your current world so you get like a", "102:25", "little screen or whatever or you look at", "102:28", "one particular thing and it looks", "102:30", "different from real life that's easier", "102:31", "to build for virtual reality you have to", "102:34", "build the whole world that you use step", "102:37", "into yeah that's like a much much deeper", "102:41", "layer of immersion which is great to", "102:43", "step into but also hard to make so", "102:45", "that's the difference I think I'm more", "102:47", "into AR at the moment well I think they", "102:50", "are in the sense of having all the", "102:52", "functions of your phone in front of you", "102:54", "in the air or when you call upon them", "102:56", "yeah kind of movie yeah like a like one", "102:59", "someone in a movie or like Iron Man even", "103:02", "like they just like women like us a", "103:03", "sheet of like this in front of them and", "103:05", "like close it only they could see that", "103:06", "like maybe that's the future and have", "103:08", "some hey Siri type you know hopefully", "103:11", "not demand yeah it's not that good it", "103:15", "works for some things it's okay I have", "103:17",

he's pretty bad", "103:29", "yeah but Bixby does a few things okay", "103:32", "like it checks flights okay makes me has", "103:33", "like Bigsby I think it's hilarious", "103:35", "because it shows how good it can be and", "103:38", "then it isn't good like it it has a", "103:40", "couple of things that it can definitely", "103:42", "do better than any other assistant but", "103:45", "what it can dig in locally on Samsung", "103:47", "phones and like do strings of commands", "103:49", "you can say hey Bixby open my Settings", "103:52", "app turn my brightness halfway down and", "103:54", "turn my Wi-Fi off and it'll do all that", "103:56", "well and Syria and Google assistant", "103:59", "won't do that but if you say hey Bixby", "104:01", "how tall is like the Statue of Liberty", "104:03", "it might not really like it's really bad", "104:06", "at a lot of basic things so yeah Google", "104:09", "assistant I think is the most complete", "104:11", "and useful I genuinely use it all the", "104:13", "time", "104:13", "Siri I mostly triggered by accident and", "104:15", "then I wonder if it's better and it", "104:17", "isn't what's offensive the Bixby has a", "104:20", "button yeah hey come on why and you", "104:23", "can't remap an unreal", "104:24", "big speed button that you accidentally", "104:27", "press all the time yeah it's pretty bad", "104:32", "yeah the iPhone

the assistant yeah while I", "104:43", "mostly use the hey Google trigger which", "104:45", "is like map to my voice so and see it", "104:47", "turns on now that I said it", "104:48", "oh wow but I started using the squeeze a", "104:50", "little more so I don't have to yell and", "104:52", "I can just squeeze it and say a", "104:54", "commander question mostly a question now", "104:57", "do you use any the home feature things", "104:59", "like to use Alexa or the Yahoo home or", "105:03", "first thing I got into my home was", "105:05", "Google home so now I have a Google home", "105:07", "home if I had Alexa first thing I", "105:09", "probably would had an Alexa home with", "105:11", "things that work with Alexa but they", "105:13", "genuinely like usually work with each", "105:15", "do your lights work with it and also", "105:17", "what I have is I have a nest thermostat", "105:19", "and I have a nest security camera", "105:22", "and I think that's it and I had smart", "105:25", "lights but I stopped using him so it's", "105:27", "mostly just the nest stuff and I can ask", "105:31", "what the temperature is upstairs and", "105:33", "then say hey change the temperature to", "105:34", "this and it'll do it so I don't have to", "105:36", "run out and find the thermostat and", "105:38", "changing myself I remember hearing that", "105:41", "Bill Gates had some pin that you would", "105:44", "put on when you entered into his home", "105:45", "and when you go into certain rooms if", "105:48", "you had a pin on it would recognize oh", "105:51", "it's bill bill likes the temperature at", "105:53", "this level he likes this art on the wall", "105:56", "so he did have LCD screens that would", "105:58", "display different images that's almost", "106:01", "too much modularity like I I kind of I", "106:04", "like a general state of like things are", "106:07", "the same unless I want them to change", "106:08", "mm-hmm that would be kind of weird like", "106:10", "every time you leave the room the art", "106:11", "changes behind you I mean you walk back", "106:13", "in and it changes back again it's kind", "106:15", "of a lot but yeah like just like a", "106:18", "couple things like I have the Google", "106:20", "home app where I like yeah change the", "106:22", "temperature once in a while or you could", "106:26", "there's this thing I've considered", "106:27", "getting the ring doorbell yeah which has", "106:29", "a camera but I don't really use the", "106:31", "doorbell that much it's mostly packages", "106:32", "get delivered to

because all this stuff is", "113:16", "like but the sensors are making some", "113:21", "sort of a contact with these buttons", "113:22", "which makes it contact with the earth", "113:24", "don't watch the censor plastic things", "113:26", "just metal so don't watch this right but", "113:28", "the rest of it it has to go through", "113:29", "these pads to get to your skin I don't", "113:32",

know I know that", "113:49", "there is a there's talk about a contact", "113:53", "lens that was being in development that", "113:56", "was going to be some sort of a lens", "113:59", "that's gonna allow you to do like a lot", "114:01", "of Minority Report type shit yeah I", "114:03", "think Texas Tech as I know it is too far", "114:07", "from that to make", "114:08", "that work just because you need like a", "114:12", "contact ones you think of is just like", "114:13", "this clear thing maybe some circuits on", "114:15", "it or whatever but like you need a", "114:16", "battery right and all you need unless it", "114:19", "operates off your body I guess but this", "114:21", "is a SmartWatch it operates off the heat", "114:23", "of your body is I mean I don't know how", "114:27", "direct like even if you do operate off", "114:30", "of some other power sis you need to get", "114:31", "that power source to connect to the", "114:34", "electronics to make it work which still", "114:36",

about that it came", "115:23", "it came from we were watching this video", "115:25", "once where there was a guy who got his", "115:26", "arm and his leg bit off by sharks he got", "115:29", "a attacked by a shark when he's surfing", "115:31", "so yeah this carbon-fiber hand that", "115:33", "totally articulates like a real hand and", "115:35", "he's standing there with his from his",

there's people working on", "116:04", "this every day so I kind of figured", "116:06", "we're headed in that direction we're", "116:08", "like what's this Jamie side just googled", "116:10", "something it's not out yet it's this is", "116:13", "called a macula which is a AR lens that", "116:16", "you wear with sunglasses so in together", "116:22", "they make an AR situation classes a lens", "116:26", "as a contact and then sunglass shared", "116:28", "the picture that they yeah what is he", "116:34", "macula you have a lens here and these", "116:38", "glasses go over top",

and it wasn't a prototype phase and", "124:03", "they were still pretty far along but it", "124:05", "was kind of like should we do this like", "124:08", "should we put this here should we keep", "124:09", "the headphone jack I was I was giving", "124:11", "them sort of yeah they kept the", "124:13", "headphone jack little things like that", "124:15", "but for the most part I think what a lot", "124:17", "of people don't understand about product", "124:19", "development is it happens many many many", "124:22", "many months before you ever see the", "124:24", "products show up so I don't know if your", "124:26", "member like all the leaks about the", "124:27", "pixel 3xl all of them guarantees six", "124:30", "months before the phone came out it was", "124:31", "done yeah like they knew that that's", "124:33", "what it was gonna or than I think any", "124:35", "phone that I can recall yeah so like", "124:37", "that's the same as the iPhone like", "124:39", "they've been working on the whatever the", "124:40", "next iPhone is they've been working on", "124:42", "that iPhone and it's probably gonna be", "124:44", "like a couple more months and then", "124:45", "they're like finalizing design and", "124:47", "things like that and so when you start", "124:49", "to see phones come out like around like", "124:52", "September and October and they start to", "124:54", "all kind of resemble each other and then", "124:56", "another one comes out and it looks the", "124:58", "same it's not like they saw the phone in", "125:00", "early October and they were like let's", "125:01", "copy that and then they made the next", "125:02", "phone", "125:03", "two weeks later they've been working on", "125:05", "this forever so like one the whole like", "125:07", "the whole notch thing was you know", "125:10", "people were like oh I hope Google is", "125:11", "trolling us and that's not really the", "125:13", "notch and there", "125:14", "have this phone with no nosh no it's", "125:16", "they've been working on this for a long", "125:17", "time this is what they planned what is", "125:19", "that one phone where the back slides up", "125:21", "for the selfie camera so there's two ver", "125:24", "I think what you're thinking of is Oppo", "125:25", "fine ten yes yeah that's a pretty I like", "125:28", "the idea it's pretty cool but I'm like", "125:30", "man how long is that thing in a wart", "125:32", "that's the question it's phones are no", "125:35", "chips in there yeah", "125:37", "any little motors yeah phones are", "125:40", "solid-state for the most part for good", "125:42", "reason you don't want a lot of moving", "125:43", "parts in a phone that you're like", "125:45", "running around with there's another one", "125:47", "called the vivo Apex", "125:49", "no it's another vivo phone basically any", "125:52", "X is what it's called and it has just", "125:54", "the selfie camera pop up yeah I've seen", "125:56", "that one too and that's another thing", "125:58", "it's like well what if a grain of sand", "126:00", "gets in there like is it toast", "126:01", "immediately yeah you drop that sucker on", "126:03", "the beefy drop it while it's open is", "126:05", "that over like Evo necks yeah any excess", "126:08", "or necks I know if I'm supposed to say", "126:10", "necks or whatever but that's a mmm it's", "126:13", "an interesting it looks cool cuz now", "126:15", "look you have the fingerprint reader", "126:16", "under the glass you have all the way to", "126:18", "the bottom as a screen and then all the", "126:19", "way to the top is the screen and they", "126:20", "you just have the selfie camera it looks", "126:22", "amazing so yeah no no bezels at all", "126:25", "yeah or basically no bezels pretty much", "126:27", "tiny chin at the bottom so that's the", "126:30", "idea is like were in this sort of a race", "126:33", "to get to a bezel this phone and I guess", "126:37", "that's the closest we can get right now", "126:40", "he's just having a little mechanical", "126:41", "thing pop out I think what we want is", "126:44", "the stuff to be behind the glass yeah a", "126:47", "camera behind the glass but then how", "126:49", "would you see the image yeah so I think", "126:51", "if based on what I know about the", "126:55", "physics of the technology you need you", "126:58", "need an OLED display and you need the", "127:00", "camera to be behind the OLED display and", "127:02", "then when you light up the camera you", "127:05", "need like a little black circle where", "127:08", "those pixels are off so they can shine", "127:10", "through I don't know if this is all", "127:11", "making sense I think you're still gonna", "127:13", "always have like some sort of a black", "127:15", "circle in the front of the phone", "127:17", "somewhere well what's fascinating about", "127:19", "iPhone versus Android is that there's so", "127:22", "much more room for possibility with", "127:24", "Android because you have so many", "127:25", "different manufacturers", "127:26", "yep that are competing in that", "127:28", "marketplace then trying to find some", "127:30", "sort of way to shine and that was where", "127:33", "the Huawei was it the mate RS was like", "127:37", "the porsche design version where i", "127:39", "thought that was a really interesting", "127:40", "phone because it was stupid expensive", "127:42", "but it had a gigantic battery and had an", "127:45", "incredible 20 megapixel camera great", "127:49", "night photos low-light photos yeah yeah", "127:53", "they really try to do like you know", "127:56", "porsche design does a lot of different", "127:57", "things they do sunglasses", "127:59", "yeah ballpoint pens they do all kinds of", "128:02", "weird stuff it really has nothing to do", "128:03", "with the car but what they've really the", "128:06", "design yeah they came up with something", "128:08", "really high-end", "128:10", "yeah and they showed there's some sort", "128:11", "of a market for that right there yeah", "128:13", "that's it again yeah so now they did", "128:16", "with the mate 20 they did the same thing", "128:17", "it's a great looking phone but it's", "128:21", "again when you look at like how much you", "128:24", "have to pay versus what extra you're", "128:26", "getting you might as well just get the", "128:29", "mate 20 pro and not worry about the", "128:30", "actions people want that porsche design", "128:33", "yeah just to go look at me I'm a baller", "128:36", "I'm a ditch they didn't they did the", "128:39", "same like Porsche does that Lamborghini", "128:41", "does then Ferrari does that Tesla does", "128:44", "that there is a Lamborghini Edition Oppo", "128:48", "find 10 yeah heard like carbon fibre and", "128:52", "a car it looks dope on the car of course", "128:55", "that's a dope looking phone period did", "128:58", "you mess with that phone at all III mess", "129:01", "with the may 20 but not the porsche", "129:02", "design one but it comes down to like", "129:04", "yeah using the phone itself is gonna be", "129:06", "pretty much the same like once you get", "129:09", "past like the design which is a little", "129:10", "bit different you open up the phone and", "129:11", "the software is you get a cool couple", "129:14", "wallpapers put like it's the same phone", "129:15", "on the inside a little more storage", "129:18", "maybe but basically the same thing well", "129:21", "I just I find it fascinating that", "129:23", "they've decided to go that far out into", "129:25", "the high-end deep end yeah I guess you", "129:29", "have to to differentiate yourself it's", "129:31", "just $2,000 right yeah starts at $2,000", "129:34", "so I guess as hype as you want to get", "129:36", "about it like are you gonna go pay", "129:37", "$2,000 for that", "129:39", "not but then when the note 9 came out it", "129:42", "kind of took a lot of the wind out of", "129:43", "their sails battery was the same size", "129:45", "cameras are fairly similar big-ass", "129:48", "screen and the other thing about phones", "129:50", "is we got all these phones that are a", "129:53", "thousand dollars now and it's made it so", "129:56", "easy to just bump up the price of your", "129:59", "phone and not have anyone blink an eye", "130:00", "I've been thinking about that a lot we", "130:03", "have the iPhone 10 starts at $1000 right", "130:06", "so then the iPhone 10 are came out and I", "130:10", "think they could have priced it anywhere", "130:12", "from 650 to 850 and they just nestled it", "130:16", "right in there at 7:15 you're like oh", "130:18", "that's way cheaper so then this phone", "130:20", "comes out pixel pixel 3 and pixel XL you", "130:23", "probably don't remember what the pixel 2", "130:25", "cost but the pixel 3 starts at $7.99", "130:27", "which seems what like that's pretty", "130:30", "reasonable right mid-range that's $150", "130:32", "more expensive than last year why like", "130:36", "what's so much better about pixel 3 than", "130:39", "pixel 2 that it's all it's just remark", "130:41", "two dollars more the market is just", "130:43", "lifted everything plus $200 set $1,000", "130:47", "as a high-end now and I think that's", "130:49", "what's convinced companies like Huawei", "130:51", "like if we want to compete with Apple", "130:52", "and really make what seems and looks", "130:54", "like a premium phone we have to charge", "130:57", "$1200 so that people know it's better", "130:59", "than the iPhone if we charge $800", "131:01", "they're not gonna think it's better than", "131:03", "the iPhone we have to charge more", "131:05", "minimal charging to prove that we have", "131:08", "more in our phone but one plus is", "131:10", "interesting because they're really", "131:11", "reasonable but their specs are very high", "131:13", "I like them they they've had a good", "131:15", "history of like they usually listen to", "131:17", "what people seem to want in a phone and", "131:19", "they're also good at like picking", "131:20", "high-end numbers that look great on", "131:22", "paper and usually translate pretty well", "131:25", "to like using the phone but they always", "131:29", "cut out they cut as many corners as they", "131:31", "can to get the price as low as they can", "131:33", "their phone last year it was about 550", "131:36", "bucks right all glass but no wireless", "131:39", "charging but it's glass we have dual", "131:41", "cameras you hardly ever use a second", "131:43", "camera but it's dual cameras eight gigs", "131:45", "of RAM Snapdragon 805 a lot of phones", "131:48", "have the same specs now these days but", "131:50", "like they've gotten pretty good at like", "131:52", "going the opposite", "131:53", "action like we're not gonna charge a", "131:54", "thousand bucks we're gonna make the same", "131:57", "phone trust us it's the same but for way", "132:00", "less money and that's that's a much more", "132:02", "popular direction to go as far as sales", "132:04", "now they've done the same strategy for", "132:06", "the newest oneplus yep and they're", "132:09", "coming out with a new one this month Oh", "132:11", "16 they keep the headphone jack yeah so", "132:15", "far so far that's my phone Jack's a", "132:18", "weird one right it's like come on Sam so", "132:20", "I'm gonna hold on to that sucker", "132:21", "Samsung's been very popular for keeping", "132:23", "the headphone jack and not having a", "132:25", "notch there like the last ones to have a", "132:28", "headphone jack and no not well I'm a big", "132:31", "fan of the way the note 9 looks when I'm", "132:34", "using it like that's a beautiful device", "132:37", "it feels net premium in the hand yeah", "132:40", "yeah yeah what do you think is wrong", "132:42", "with it with note 9 yeah my biggest", "132:45", "problem with note 9 is the front-facing", "132:47", "camera and the software and the software", "132:51", "is not even that bad it's just it's", "132:53", "gotten slow for me quickly a lot of", "132:55", "times like I've been using Note 9 I also", "132:57", "don't think it's the prettiest software", "132:59", "I really like Samsung screens so I know", "133:01", "they can make good looking stuff but I", "133:03", "think if they made", "133:04", "I don't think member Google Play edition", "133:06", "when they used to do that mhmmm if they", "133:08", "made a Google Play edition galaxy note 9", "133:11", "I would instantly buy that phone that", "133:13", "would be sick because I love Google's", "133:15", "like software being cleaner and looking", "133:17", "a little better yeah if you look at", "133:19", "Samsung's software it looks kind of", "133:20", "cartoony a lot of times very colorful", "133:23", "not a problem but it's just not my", "133:25", "favorite I know some people have figured", "133:27", "out a way to use the Google launcher
