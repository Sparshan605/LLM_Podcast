not", "06:37", "even a real targets these are a bunch of", "06:38", "civilians so they refused", "06:41", "and then Silas all testified against his", "06:44", "commander at the inquiry and he was",

been", "07:59", "proven that they didn't really", "08:00", "understand right bacteria are diseases", "08:03", "there's one story that's impossible is", "08:06", "not a proven thing doing because",

"smallpox hospital but you know while we", "08:25", "do know that he suggested it we have no", "08:28", "proof whatsoever that it was actually", "08:29", "done so let's probably have the rumor", "08:32", "got started right problem but in most", "08:34", "cases would happen is just that the", "08:36", "Europeans came over and just", "08:38", "inadvertently introduced Native", "08:40", "Americans diseases and 90% of them were", "08:43", "wiped out yeah that's a crazy number if", "08:46", "you really stop to think about it it's", "08:47", "going to see there are probably the most", "08:49", "dramatic demographic disaster in human", "08:52", "history because you know I never", "08:54", "for you at a situation where a whole", "08:56", "continent was not exposed to a series of",

somebody", "09:05", "and the next day half the village is", "09:06", "dead you know yeah that's crazy it's", "09:08", "just it's amazing that if a group of", "09:11", "people just has not come in contact with", "09:13", "something that other people come in", "09:15", "contact with all the time and just god", "09:17", "we've got a cold", "09:18", "you'd be fine just have some chicken", "09:19", "soup take a nap meanwhile these people", "09:21", "are just dead that's probably off", "09:23", "that's probably why aliens don't show up", "09:25", "it's like those motherfuckers are dirty", "09:27", "amazing show up they sneeze on us and we", "09:29", "with our whole planet will die or maybe", "09:32", "the opposite they know they'll kill us", "09:33", "exactly maybe they have like some super", "09:35", "advanced diseases that's the other", "09:36", "possible yeah I guess it's just a immune", "09:39", "system thing right if your immune", "09:40", "systems not prepared for it so it is", "09:42", "there's a great book by a guy named Dan", "09:45", "Flores well he wrote two but one of them", "09:48", "actually a woman actually was a paper", "09:50", "that he wrote about the Buffalo and he's", "09:54", "saying that it's really interesting", "09:56", "because he compares the initial", "09:59", "encounters that European settlers had", "10:02", "and European travelers had before the", "10:06", "Native Americans were wiped out and they", "10:09", "talked about how many animals were on", "10:11", "the plains and they make a direct", "10:12", "account of it and then after the", "10:14", "Europeans had come and 90% of the Native", "10:17", "Americans have been wiped out that's", "10:18", "when the Buffalo population increased", "10:21", "goes through the roof and you're seeing", "10:22", "these gigantic packs of million would be", "10:26", "packs herds I guess of millions and", "10:28", "millions of Buffalo and he say that's", "10:30", "directly attributed to the lack of", "10:32", "predators which means lack of Native", "10:35", "Americans they were preying on these", "10:37", "Buffalo of course really interesting", "10:39", "yeah that guy you item on the podcast", "10:40", "once right", "10:41", "yeah I'm on again I love that guy that", "10:43", "was awesome his book coyote America that", "10:47", "book changed the way I feel about", "10:48", "coyotes yeah I used to be like fuck", "10:50", "those little rats run them over and now", "10:52", "I'm like those little wolves yeah that", "10:56", "was a good episode I enjoyed that one", "10:57", "yeah

"of people in this area", "11:08", "yeah it was it was fairly late at night", "11:10", "and he was on this road I someone just", "11:11", "pull over and just see what this coyote", "11:13", "does and he just fucking stood like", "11:15", "thirty feet from my car just staring at", "11:17", "me just staring at me that's badass", "11:19", "right there just like whatever dude what", "11:21", "are you

figure out what to do right", "11:31", "here those guys don't mess around that's", "11:33", "crazy that they just can live and it'd", "11:36", "be completely embedded in our society", "11:38", "like there we had a biologist what was", "11:41", "the gentleman's name that we had from", "11:42", "the department of parks and services see", "11:47", "if we find this guy but he's actually a", "11:50", "biologist who tracks coyotes mm-hmm and", "11:52", "he tracks them all over the state and", "11:55", "even tracks mount lines they tagged them", "11:57", "and put those collars on them and stuff", "11:59", "but he said that there's a pack of", "12:01", "coyotes it lives in downtown LA yeah I", "12:03", "believe in the heat of everything they", "12:05", "found some abandoned building and they'd", "12:08", "end up in this abandoned building and", "12:09", "that's where they look how those guys", "12:12", "are resilient they thrive in anything", "12:14", "yeah yeah you like crazy animal stories", "12:17", "so check this out about a coyote", "12:19", "there's my mom went for a walk with her", "12:21", "dog and her dog is a big mean dog right", "12:24", "so they are walking and they see ahead", "12:26", "of them this little girl probably 10", "12:28", "years old with this tiny little five", "12:30", "pound dog type of thing and there's a", "12:33", "coyote maybe like 20 yards behind there", "12:35", "that's clearly stalking them and the", "12:36", "girl didn't see it", "12:37", "and is obviously aiming for the five", "12:39", "pounder and this chest and so my mom", "12:42", "yeah that there like a watch out so the", "12:43", "girl freaks out pick up the her dog and", "12:46", "she figure she's safe", "12:47", "coyote doesn't get actually still", "12:48", "stalking them down and so at that point", "12:51", "my mom kind of let their dog ago and dog", "12:53", "chase the coyote often that was that but", "12:55", "I was like man those guys don't yeah you", "12:59", "don't want to leave little dogs you", "13:01", "don't want little girls around I know", "13:03", "it's like why a ten-year-old is walking", "13:05", "the dog by yourself that's probably not", "13:06", "the best idea today there's an instance", "13:09", "that happened a few years back where a", "13:11", "19 year old girl was murdered not", "13:13", "murdered killed partially eaten by", "13:17", "coyotes coyotes yes yeah I think they", "13:20", "bits", "13:21", "chunks out of her tore apart she died in", "13:24", "the hospital pretty sure the 19 year old", "13:25", "and I yelled yeah but there it was", "13:29", "unusual circumstances and then one of", "13:31", "the unusual circumstances that the", "13:32", "Coyotes in this area are very limited in", "13:35", "terms of what game is available okay so", "13:37", "much so that they've been known to go", "13:39", "after moose that these little coyotes", "13:42", "actually go after moose and have", "13:44", "successfully taken moose out yeah so", "13:47", "these are gangster coyote ex when you", "13:49", "look at that they don't look that big", "13:51", "really big ones like 50 pounds yeah yeah", "13:54", "I watched a

around stomping these wolves and", "14:07", "they're circling her and then they just", "14:09", "grabbed the calf and dragged it away and", "14:10", "she's fighting off the other wolves and", "14:12", "stomping them she stomped the shit out", "14:14", "of a few of them yeah she fucked a few", "14:16", "of them up small satisfaction", "14:17", "thoughtfulness when yeah yeah I said I", "14:22", "want that one sucks because there he is", "14:23", "Justin Brown that gentleman very nice", "14:26", "guy we give us a lot of interesting", "14:28", "insights to like what happens in you", "14:32", "know like with biologists how they how", "14:34", "they tracked these animals and what what", "14:36", "some of the problems are but we we're in", "14:39", "such a unique place in Southern", "14:40", "California because there's such a", "14:42", "massive population of people but there's", "14:44", "all these predators that are sort of", "14:46", "like entangled oh yeah in our system no", "14:50", "like hawks everywhere everywhere you", "14:53", "look there's hawks swooping down", "14:55", "snatching doves and shit and my my", "14:57", "daughter got a little dog I always", "14:59", "thought

"pounds or so right so I'm like you can't", "15:09", "let him alone in the yard not because", "15:11", "there's probably not coyotes in the yard", "15:14", "but they're definitely hawks around", "15:16", "there's definitely owls that thing look", "15:18", "like a big rabbit they're gonna snatch", "15:20", "it in three seconds you cannot leave him", "15:22", "in the yard like that because yeah

getting around it you know", "15:32", "and when we look at how", "15:34", "horrific the wild world is it's not a", "15:37", "surprise that people who were just like", "15:39", "recently civilized over
