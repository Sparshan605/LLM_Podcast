your", "00:18", "time for people who don't know the story", "00:21", "there is a documentary", "00:24", "Jeremy Korbel it has a documentary out", "00:26", "right now it's called bob lazar area 51",

"01:02", "s 4 oh just about 15 miles south of area", "01:05", "51 okay um you worked in what would you", "01:11", "how would you describe it I guess", "01:14", "within the area 51 compound you can call", "01:17", "that a subset of area 51 and you got", "01:20", "that job before that you were working", "01:23", "before that I had worked at Los Alamos", "01:25", "right National Labs in New Mexico and", "01:27", "you were involved in what kind of work", "01:30", "the nuclear weapon development physics I", "01:32", "mean that's they do everything there so", "01:34", "how did they approach you to say hey", "01:37", "bomb", "01:38", "once you come on out to the Nevada", "01:39", "desert well the way this went down was", "01:46", "at that time I was 1982 I I put a jet", "01:53", "engine in my my Honda and Los Alamos put", "01:58", "it on the front page of the paper", "02:00", "said you know Los Alamos man physicist", "02:04", "at the lab you know built this 200 mile", "02:07", "an hour you know on the jet car that I", "02:09", "drove to work every day so", "02:13", "I was known in Los Alamos that the guy", "02:15", "with the weird car and you know you", "02:16", "could hear it from you know a mile away", "02:18", "anyway the day that came out on the", "02:23", "front page of the paper was the day", "02:25", "Edward Teller the father of the hydrogen", "02:27", "bomb was giving a lecture down there at", "02:30", "the lab and we didn't have much going on", "02:33", "that day in our group and I asked if I", "02:36", "could go down there and I went down", "02:40", "there early and Ed teller was outside", "02:43", "leaning on a brick wall there and", "02:46", "reading the front page of the paper now", "02:48", "there's a guy out of history so I", "02:50", "introduced myself hey I'm the guy you're", "02:51", "reading about there and we talked for a", "02:53", "little while and it was cool you know", "02:56", "fast forward two years later I had moved", "02:58", "out to Las Vegas and had you know left", "03:01", "Los Alamos and you know went on to other", "03:03", "things and I wanted to get back into the", "03:05", "scientific humanity yeah I left start", "03:07", "other businesses and and that sort of", "03:10", "thing so I sent resumes out and one of", "03:13", "them went out to Ed teller and", "03:14", "referenced our meeting you know back it", "03:17", "back in that the day and anyway he", "03:20", "remembered me and gave me a reference", "03:24", "somebody to contact at EG&G", "03:26", "and that's pretty much how it started so", "03:30", "you get a phone call or a letter like", "03:33", "what do you get well I got a what did I", "03:38", "get I got a letter initially and went", "03:42", "down for an interview probably a couple", "03:44", "times and it was down at EG&G special", "03:46", "projects which was at McCarran Airport", "03:49", "at that time out in Las Vegas and did", "03:52", "they give you any sort of job", "03:53", "description of what you were applying", "03:55", "for they said it was for Edie I can't", "03:59", "remember exactly what they did this was", "04:01", "a long time ago but I I think it was", "04:04", "advanced propulsion or something like", "04:06", "that something relatively generic and", "04:08", "they said it's in a remote area you know", "04:12", "it's gonna be some days on some days off", "04:14", "and you know it was kind of a it was", "04:19", "kind of not exactly a full-time job but", "04:22", "you might have to be out there for two", "04:23", "weeks at a time and take two weeks off", "04:26", "so", "04:26", "kind of uh the work schedule would be", "04:28", "kind of broken up and did this seem", "04:31", "attractive you or did it seem weird no I", "04:34", "really wasn't weird because people that", "04:36", "work at the test site anybody that's", "04:38", "familiar with the area up there you know", "04:40", "working at the nuclear test site or at", "04:43", "the Tonopah test range north of there", "04:45", "that's typically how things go so you", "04:48", "had known about it from the scientific", "04:50", "community because the area 51 at that", "04:52", "time know anything about area 51 okay so", "04:55", "they just said it was in a you know in a", "04:57", "remote location and you just know it was", "05:00", "up at the test site right so but there", "05:02", "was no mention of area 51 at that time", "05:04", "so they've done hundreds of nuclear", "05:06", "tests in Nevada Nevada that that whole", "05:09", "area was there's been just giant chunks", "05:11", "of Nevada the people yeah there's a big", "05:13", "piece of Nevada and it split up into", "05:15", "different areas there's a nuclear test", "05:17", "site", "05:17", "there's area 51 there's the Tonopah test", "05:20", "range north of that there's little sub", "05:22", "areas there's areas where they test", "05:23", "chemical weapons and things like that so", "05:25", "it's all broken up as a you know", "05:27", "gigantic test area so take me back to", "05:29", "first day on the job you accept a job", "05:32", "they take you out there yeah it's the", "05:39", "first day really I didn't really get to", "05:41", "see a whole lot the first day was", "05:42", "essentially just paperwork that's when I", "05:44", "flew into area 51 proper and I left", "05:48", "McCarran Airport and flu what they call", "05:51", "the Janet flights just you know a", "05:55", "passenger plane from Las Vegas to area", "05:58", "51 and it was really just going through", "06:01", "a mountain of paperwork that day from", "06:05", "security clearances to cat there was it", "06:09", "was like two or three hours of just", "06:11", "solid paperwork and that was that was", "06:13", "really an uneventful first day when did", "06:17", "things get weird when did you realize", "06:22", "they at what point in time did you say", "06:24", "hey this is not normal work like this", "06:29", "doesn't even seem like it's from this", "06:30", "planet that I can't tell you what day", "06:34", "that occurred on because so much time", "06:36", "has gone by the days of kind of fusion", "06:39", "to", "06:39", "and I can't listen today's was it a slow", "06:42", "burn or was there a moment of", "06:44", "recognition well they're the the first", "06:48", "inkling I had was when I I came in", "06:50", "normal there's this facility that is at", "06:52", "s4 it's in the side of a mountain and", "06:57", "normally we had pulled in with the bus", "07:00", "and gone around the front through a", "07:02", "normal double door this time that I went", "07:05", "in there were hanger doors open I went", "07:08", "into the hangar door and in the hangar", "07:10", "door was the disk the flying saucer", "07:13", "that I worked on I saw it sitting there", "07:15", "and we walked by a headed little", "07:17", "American flag stuck on the side and I", "07:19", "thought oh my god this finally explains", "07:22", "all the flying saucer stories this is", "07:23", "just an advanced fighter and it this is", "07:26", "fuckin hilarious", "07:27", "so I went by I sloughs my hands", "07:30", "alongside it I got reprimanded", "07:32", "immediately for touching the thing and", "07:33", "there was a guy in armed guard that", "07:36", "followed us in and just said keep your", "07:37", "eyes at forward in your hands at your", "07:39", "side and just walk in the door so that", "07:42", "was the first time I had seen anything", "07:44", "that was weird it was sometime later", "07:48", "that I was introduced to my my lab", "07:52", "partner Barry and we had some of the", "07:55", "subcomponents of the craft in the lab", "07:58", "and Barry was very anxious to get a new", "08:01", "lab partner so he was very talkative and", "08:03", "couldn't wait to show me different", "08:04", "things and it was in the demonstration", "08:07", "of the reactor working where it caught", "08:10", "my attention to where this is technology", "08:14", "that doesn't even exist so I mean that", "08:18", "was the first time I knew that this is", "08:20", "really something different what was it", "08:22", "what was it what was a what was it about", "08:26", "this reactor that made you think that it", "08:29", "didn't exist", "08:32", "technologically well it was that I", "08:34", "actually have to back up because there", "08:35", "were some briefings that I read it", "08:37", "before that that you know certainly gave", "08:41", "me the impression that this was going to", "08:43", "be a weird job but this was the first", "08:45", "hands-on thing this was a small reactor", "08:48", "about the size of a hemisphere about the", "08:50", "size of a basketball on a metal plate", "08:53", "and when it was running it produced a", "08:56", "gravitational field a gravitational", "08:58", "field of its own now this is something", "09:00", "that we can't do we can't produce any", "09:02", "gravity the only way we get gravity is", "09:05", "from large quantities of mass but", "09:07", "there's no machine we can have that", "09:09", "turns on that makes gravity like you", "09:11", "know you can turn on an electromagnet", "09:13", "and it makes a magnetic field we can't", "09:15", "make a gravitational field", "09:17", "anyway this device was producing that", "09:19", "and Barry said it's almost like he was", "09:22", "bragging go ahead try and try and touch", "09:24", "the sphere and I I couldn't it would it", "09:27", "pushed my hands away just like two like", "09:28", "poles of a magnet so that was like when", "09:31", "you take two magnets and try to press", "09:32", "them together yeah yeah kind of cushion", "09:35", "feeling but you can't you can't get them", "09:37", "together the closer you put them the", "09:39", "more they push but you felt that", "09:40", "physical with my hand yeah now there's", "09:42", "nothing there's nothing that does that", "09:44", "and that immediately caught my attention", "09:46", "going wow this is something else what", "09:49", "was your thought like when you felt that", "09:51", "and you knew that there was nothing that", "09:53", "you were aware of that could predict", "09:55", "that connected me to the briefings that", "09:57", "I read on the the first day at s4 was", "10:02", "that you know everything that I had read", "10:04", "was apparently accurate what were you", "10:07", "reading I read it was kind of an", "10:09", "overview this project was to back", "10:13", "engineer the alien craft and", "10:17", "specifically it was to try and back", "10:20", "engineer and see if we can duplicate the", "10:22", "technology with available materials now", "10:26", "to do this they split the project into", "10:29", "you know many different pieces for", "10:31", "several reasons they do this on all", "10:33", "classified project so nobody has the", "10:36", "complete story but they compartmentalize", "10:39", "everything now we had the power and", "10:41", "propulsion system", "10:42", "so what briefings they gave me were like", "10:44", "a one or two page overview of some of", "10:46", "the other projects that were going on", "10:48", "you know on the craft the only reason", "10:51", "they do that is just in case what you're", "10:53", "working on is connected intimately in", "10:55", "some way that we don't know of - one of", "10:57", "the other projects you have to know", "10:58", "there excuse me their existence so you", "11:04", "know I bet again everything from", "11:06", "metallurgy", "11:07", "- you know weapon potential the craft", "11:11", "and these were all you know essentially", "11:13", "very short briefings but mine was just", "11:16", "power and propulsion and it made it very", "11:19", "clear that what I read was accurate so", "11:23", "when you're reading that before you", "11:25", "actually saw the reactor what were your", "11:28", "thoughts on what they were describing if", "11:32", "you knew that something like that didn't", "11:34", "exist and they're describing it in the", "11:36", "briefings what did you think you were", "11:38", "gonna see I really I didn't know at the", "11:41", "time I mean I was reading I thought is", "11:43", "this is some kind of test see if you're", "11:47", "crazy well not to see if I'm crazy - you", "11:50", "know a lot of times they'll take in real", "11:52", "high security jobs I mean they'll", "11:55", "intentionally insert nonsense into him", "11:58", "whether it's to confuse the fact or if", "12:01", "for someone was to leak it out they", "12:04", "would carry that information along and", "12:05", "know where it came from so I read", "12:08", "through the documents but you know I", "12:10", "didn't know if this was you know part of", "12:13", "some kind of test or you know or what or", "12:17", "was it potentially realistic I mean I'd", "12:19", "really didn't consider it being all that", "12:22", "possible as far as being the actual", "12:25", "thing that I was going to work on at the", "12:27", "time how did they turn it on there the", "12:31", "reactor yeah the reactor can be turned", "12:33", "on or turned off in a lot of different", "12:34", "ways the way Barry showed me it the", "12:38", "hemisphere is removed there's a small", "12:41", "tower in the middle when you put the", "12:42", "hemisphere on the reactor activates the", "12:45", "reactor shuts down its its load sensing", "12:48", "so if there's if there's no load on the", "12:52", "reactor at all it shuts down when", "12:53", "there's a load present on it it starts", "12:56", "up again load meaning you can consider", "12:59", "it an electrical load so although it", "13:03", "doesn't necessarily operate electrically", "13:06", "there's no wiring that connects any of", "13:09", "the sub components together whatsoever", "13:11", "they just have to be in the immediate", "13:12", "vicinity it's a it is but the stuff is", "13:16", "borderline magic and that's essentially", "13:19", "where we left it", "13:20", "you know when I left the project so", "13:23", "there was no progress made there was", "13:26", "some progress I mean we did identify at", "13:28", "least we think some processes and and", "13:30", "had a rough idea we think of what was", "13:33", "going on but I think this is a problem", "13:36", "that they've had for a long time and you", "13:41", "know I was replacing somebody that Barry", "13:44", "worked with prior to me and I think", "13:45", "there was some horrific accident that I", "13:48", "didn't have a whole lot of information", "13:50", "on but you know Barry alluded to that a", "13:52", "horrific accident like where someone", "13:54", "died or yeah where somebody died because", "13:57", "they were trying to tamper with things", "13:59", "or figure out how something worked yeah", "14:01", "the reactor in particular but yet he let", "14:04", "you touch it yeah I think what they were", "14:07", "trying to do was cut into one now they", "14:10", "had they had more than one there and I", "14:11", "that was supposedly there was an", "14:13", "unannounced nuclear test and that's what", "14:17", "it was at the time remember they would", "14:18", "still do an underground nuclear test at", "14:20", "the test site but from what I understand", "14:23", "according to Barry there was an attempt", "14:26", "made now this must have been a pretty", "14:27", "desperate attempt because it's not a", "14:29", "very scientific process to cut you know", "14:32", "analyze something that way but it looked", "14:34", "like they used a plasma cutter or", "14:36", "something I got to cut into an exactor", "14:39", "how many of these things they have they", "14:41", "had nine nine craft altogether I only", "14:43", "got hands-on with one of them so I can't", "14:46", "really say what the how the others", "14:49", "operated you see the other ones yeah at", "14:51", "one time and only one time the bay doors", "14:54", "that between the hangars were all open", "14:56", "and I could see all the way through and", "14:59", "were they all exactly the same no they", "15:02", "were all different different shapes yeah", "15:04", "but they were all from somewhere else", "15:07", "yeah absolutely now did anyone make any", "15:11", "attempt to explain or to to tell you", "15:15", "where they came from no no no one is the", "15:18", "least bit interested in letting", "15:20", "everybody know all the facts they want", "15:22", "to give you the minimum information", "15:24", "that's necessary to complete your task", "15:26", "so you're not getting the story of where", "15:28", "they came from you're not getting the", "15:30", "story of what how much progress other", "15:32", "people are making you just focus on", "15:34", "the small component but they gave you", "15:37", "some indication that they've been", "15:38", "working on these for a while yeah when", "15:41", "do you think they acquired these I", "15:44", "really couldn't say I think they've been", "15:47", "around for a while so they bring you", "15:52", "into this room you see this reactor", "15:55", "working you you realize this is nothing", "15:58", "that as far as like the scientific", "15:59", "community at current time has the", "16:02", "ability to create wait you still don't", "16:05", "what is your life like from that moment", "16:08", "on is that where everything changes", "16:09", "because you do I mean I would imagine", "16:12", "the moment you actually make contact", "16:14", "with something that's extraterrestrial", "16:16", "whether it's an object or a being", "16:18", "something where you can actually", "16:19", "absolutely be certain it's not from here", "16:22", "your whole paradigm the whole world you", "16:26", "live in is now a different place well", "16:28", "this is the only time it became exciting", "16:30", "you know the rest of the time though it", "16:33", "was really an an ominous feeling being", "16:36", "at work but it at that time it was", "16:38", "exciting I mean this was now I knew we", "16:41", "were on the absolute beyond actually", "16:43", "beyond the cutting edge of science and I", "16:45", "was I was so absolutely excited to be", "16:49", "there every single time I was you know", "16:53", "it with this was a fantastic opportunity", "16:55", "and however in in short order it began", "17:01", "to concern me we really have no idea", "17:05", "what we're talking about and the", "17:09", "excitement kind of turned to dread at", "17:12", "some point because the amount of power", "17:15", "we're dealing with is astronomical", "17:19", "I mean to affect gravity to produce the", "17:21", "effects like this equipment does takes", "17:24", "huge amounts of power and I've given the", "17:28", "example before of you know taking a", "17:31", "small portable nuclear reactor and you", "17:33", "know putting it back into Victorian", "17:35", "times you know with the scientists at", "17:37", "the time and just dropping it in a room", "17:40", "and they come and look at it and see", "17:42", "that it's producing power and wonder how", "17:44", "it works so they start taking it apart", "17:47", "and as soon as they get some of the", "17:49", "shielding off the people are going to", "17:50", "drop dead because of the radiation", "17:52", "inside now the people have no idea that", "17:56", "it radiation even exists back then but", "17:58", "anybody that comes in to check on them", "18:00", "will also drop dead and you know there's", "18:04", "no reason that that exact scenario", "18:07", "couldn't happen with what we're dealing", "18:09", "with we have no idea", "18:11", "how the physics operate within this", "18:13", "thing the power levels are art like I", "18:16", "said astronomic like it's incredibly", "18:18", "dangerous to tinker with something like", "18:20", "that and you know in some respects we", "18:23", "were guinea pigs just try to find out", "18:25", "how to make this thing so they had a", "18:27", "series as far as you surmised that a", "18:31", "series of different scientists try to", "18:32", "back engineer this thing try to figure", "18:34", "out what this thing was and they would", "18:36", "bring in new people and like let's throw", "18:37", "Bob at it yeah yeah and they I know I", "18:40", "don't know how many but I knew there was", "18:42", "certainly one before me and I knew he", "18:44", "died during the analysis of the or the", "18:47", "reactor itself and you don't know how", "18:52", "many have worked on it and no one gave", "18:55", "this could have been there for 50 years", "18:57", "it could have been there for five years", "18:58", "when they give you instructions", "19:00", "what are they saying like when they're", "19:02", "giving you direction they're showing you", "19:03", "all this stuff like what what what are", "19:05", "they saying well specifically what are", "19:06", "they asking of you well essentially what", "19:09", "they ask is is what I said we are just", "19:12", "to gather as much information as", "19:13", "possible find out how it operates and", "19:15", "see if we can duplicate it so but they", "19:17", "notice relays you where it was from they", "19:19", "never let you ask questions about where", "19:22", "it's from well if the information I read", "19:26", "in the briefings was accurate now what I", "19:28", "do have to say is the information that", "19:30", "pertained directly to the reactor was", "19:34", "accurate what I read did I mean did jive", "19:39", "with reality in terms of how in terms of", "19:43", "how it was made how what we saw how it", "19:45", "operated the materials how it you know", "19:48", "turned on and what was discovered", "19:51", "discovered about it I'm sorry the", "19:55", "migraine is really making it hard for me", "19:56", "to thank you sorry no we we talked that", "19:59", "before the podcast you tell everybody", "20:00", "Bob", "20:00", "getting a migraine I know you're very", "20:02", "stressed out by this is just one of the", "20:03", "reasons why I appreciate you doing this", "20:06", "where was I already we're talking right", "20:09", "the plaintiff and so there was some", "20:13", "paperwork that indicated that this was", "20:16", "from the Zeta Reticuli star system now", "20:19", "yeah now how they obtained that I", "20:23", "haven't I haven't the slightest idea but", "20:26", "it wasn't just from the Zeta Reticuli", "20:27", "star system it was what they called zr3", "20:30", "so it was a third planet in that star", "20:33", "system so there was no other information", "20:36", "about it other than that supposedly", "20:39", "where the craft came from now was that", "20:41", "true I don't know I have no way of", "20:42", "verifying that but that was printed in", "20:44", "the same materials that referenced the", "20:46", "reactor now I looked that stuff up when", "20:48", "I went home and Zeta Reticuli is a", "20:52", "binary star two stars that orbit orbit", "20:56", "one another and it's only visible in the", "20:58", "southern hemisphere and it's about", "20:59", "thirty some-odd light-years away", "21:01", "so that's literally all the information", "21:03", "I have about that I don't know how they", "21:05", "found out it came from there and you", "21:07", "also probably have some suspicions that", "21:09", "they give you some disinformation like", "21:11", "you were talking about before yeah yeah", "21:14", "I mean if you ever decided to talk about", "21:17", "this they added a bunch of nonsense to", "21:19", "make whatever is factual look ridiculous", "21:21", "right or be able to trace it down like", "21:24", "okay this fax came out and you know this", "21:26", "Lazar guy said okay you know came from", "21:28", "Zeta Reticuli so they knew it was when", "21:30", "he read Isaiah reticulate we like what", "21:33", "in the fuck is this well reading all of", "21:36", "the stuff it was what kind of fuck is", "21:38", "this you like why did I sign up for this", "21:40", "no no I would dit to me this was cool", "21:42", "this was interesting I said I was just", "21:44", "excited to be out in a secure area you", "21:47", "know in the middle of the desert is", "21:48", "awesome how old are you I get as in my", "21:51", "20s yeah so you probably totally geeked", "21:55", "out oh yeah it's that this was this was", "21:58", "great I mean I was excited so I didn't", "22:00", "care I'm reading through everything and", "22:02", "so you read through all the Zeta", "22:03", "particularly thing but then when you see", "22:05", "the actual starship with the little", "22:06", "American flag sticker on it", "22:08", "well that was was that later or before", "22:12", "that", "22:14", "that was before so before so you see the", "22:17", "thing before you say oh that's that", "22:19", "before it's hard so many years yeah I", "22:22", "can't either way it doesn't matter the", "22:24", "days have fused together it's so hard to", "22:26", "separate what happened in each visit do", "22:28", "you remember the thought process when", "22:30", "you read that it's from Zeta Reticuli", "22:32", "yeah it it it it didn't hit me like a", "22:35", "ton of bricks or anything is just like", "22:36", "yeah okay bullshit I don't know", "22:40", "these were now I don't I mean because", "22:42", "when I read it I hadn't verified", "22:44", "anything and this was just a bunch of", "22:46", "stuff I was reading and I thought maybe", "22:48", "after this they're just gonna give me a", "22:49", "test and see what I can remember and", "22:51", "write crazy information and it would but", "22:55", "like I said when I finally went in with", "22:58", "Barry and had hands-on experience with", "23:03", "what they were talking about it took on", "23:06", "a completely different meaning so", "23:08", "there's a plate there's this thing that", "23:10", "looks like half a basketball and when", "23:12", "it's on you can't come anywhere near it", "23:13", "you can't touch it right how is what is", "23:17", "gravity about that like the concept of", "23:20", "gravity most people's gravity is", "23:21", "bringing something towards it right well", "23:23", "I guess you would say it's anti-gravity", "23:24", "it's gravity shifted 180 degrees it's a", "23:27", "you know antigravity and did they have", "23:32", "any understanding about what could", "23:35", "possibly create this effect did they", "23:38", "have any areas where they'd like you to", "23:41", "look into no they well they knew there", "23:48", "was a fuel source in it and they were", "23:50", "proficient at making it work and again", "23:54", "my analogy to something like this is you", "23:56", "can drop a motorcycle off in the wagon", "23:58", "train days and just leave it with the", "24:00", "keys parked outside you know somebody's", "24:02", "place everybody will come around it and", "24:04", "they'll poke and prod and eventually", "24:06", "they'll turn the key get it to start and", "24:08", "become proficient at writing it yeah but", "24:11", "they won't be able to understand what", "24:14", "the hell's going on they won't be able", "24:15", "to make the plastic fender much less", "24:18", "anything else and I think that's exactly", "24:19", "the state we were at we played around", "24:22", "with the parts long enough before I got", "24:24", "there where they could make the reactor", "24:25", "operate", "24:27", "take the fuel out and know that it makes", "24:30", "it work how exactly what was going on in", "24:35", "the reactor remained a mystery at the", "24:38", "time I think we made some progress on", "24:42", "what was going on inside but I don't", "24:45", "think anybody really knew anything they", "24:47", "could just watch what was going on and", "24:49", "make note of it", "24:50", "how long were there I'd say about six", "24:53", "months or so and what what progress", "24:55", "admit was made while you were there well", "24:58", "we came up with a bunch of reasonably", "25:02", "good ideas about how the reactor worked", "25:04", "and one of them was the base the square", "25:08", "base of it was essentially like a", "25:09", "cyclotron which is a small particle", "25:11", "accelerator a circular one particle", "25:14", "accelerators of linear particle", "25:16", "accelerators are just a you know long", "25:18", "tube essentially in the accelerate", "25:20", "particles with high voltage and you know", "25:22", "radio frequencies till they reach high", "25:24", "speeds but a cyclotron does that in a", "25:27", "small circular area and there's this", "25:30", "very heavy element fuel element 115", "25:33", "something that wasn't on our periodic", "25:35", "charts at the time but it is now it is", "25:39", "now yeah when did it become on the", "25:41", "periodic table now the way their charts", "25:43", "now you know I don't remember do you", "25:45", "remember when they 2004 Durham Germany I", "25:49", "think is where they first advocated for", "25:50", "atoms that lasted 220 milliseconds the", "25:53", "atoms it's nothing right and then later", "25:56", "was discovered a couple more times they", "25:57", "could fabricate it then they gave it", "25:59", "they gave it a place then on the", "26:01", "Periodic Chart", "26:02", "after that called it moscovia so they", "26:05", "told you about this stuff in 1982 yeah", "26:10", "well what what year was this it was 80", "26:14", "88 and 89 when I was there 82 is 182 it", "26:17", "was near Los Alamos I'm sorry yeah so 88", "26:20", "89 they told you about this stuff so", "26:22", "this was not like no they didn't they", "26:24", "didn't tell me about it that's one of", "26:26", "the things that this group came up with", "26:27", "mmm the guy I keep losing my train of", "26:33", "thought with this thing so this one area", "26:35", "this this element 115 was the fuel yeah", "26:40", "it was the fuel that the world will", "26:51", "forgive you for having a migraine yes", "26:54", "really I didn't think that'd give you", "26:56", "more person so I say what yeah", "26:58", "definitely as I said one thing you know", "27:00", "bought for the last 30 years people have", "27:02", "just been on the attack on Bob you know", "27:04", "getting to know him the personal effects", "27:07", "on his life it's really hard to", "27:08", "understand unless you meet his family", "27:10", "and his wife I mean this is the last", "27:12", "thing he wanted to fucking do was have", "27:14", "to talk yeah we should explain that", "27:16", "chairman the you and I had this", "27:18", "conversation I watched a documentary we", "27:20", "had this conversation and I said I have", "27:23", "to talk to him", "27:24", "yeah the document there was there's been", "27:26", "detractors there's been a bunch of", "27:28", "people that called bullshit on many of", "27:30", "the things that you've said but over", "27:32", "time many of the things that you talked", "27:35", "about even in the 80s have proven to be", "27:37", "true things that people said we're not", "27:40", "true were proven to be true element 115", "27:42", "was one of them right right right", "27:46", "element 115 the fuel they had was stable", "27:49", "in other words it didn't decay it wasn't", "27:51", "emitting radioactivity when they", "27:54", "synthesized two or three atoms of the", "27:57", "115 it did decay and it was not a stable", "28:01", "element so they're they're kind of two", "28:03", "different things but this is kind of", "28:05", "typical elements always have or pretty", "28:08", "much always have stable isotopes and", "28:11", "unstable isotopes like I think cesium", "28:13", "has like 30 unstable isotopes to it so", "28:17", "all right well hydrogen for example", "28:18", "you're familiar with hydrogen gas it's", "28:22", "stable it's not radioactive but there's", "28:24", "also two other types of hydrogen", "28:27", "deuterium and tritium and deuterium", "28:30", "isn't radioactive it's another stable", "28:33", "isotope of hydrogen but tritium is", "28:35", "radioactive now they're all hydrogen but", "28:38", "they just have different amounts of", "28:39", "neutrons so it's the same thing with", "28:42", "other elements and element 115 depending", "28:45", "on the amount of neutrons it has", "28:48", "designates the isotope but it's 115 they", "28:52", "will continue to take", "28:54", "or experiment and try and make 115 at", "28:58", "different isotopes and I'm sure", "28:59", "eventually they'll come up with a stable", "29:01", "version but it's the taste stable", "29:03", "version that has the properties that", "29:04", "we're talking about so they somehow or", "29:07", "another had acquired a stable version", "29:09", "did they say that the stable version had", "29:11", "come with this crap it absolutely came", "29:13", "with the graft yeah so at the time you", "29:16", "having a firm knowledge of the periodic", "29:18", "chart and knowing what was real and what", "29:20", "wasn't real what was your reaction to", "29:23", "having this stable element 115 that", "29:26", "wasn't even supposed to exist well", "29:27", "everything was impossible right I mean", "29:29", "down down to the metal I I did get a", "29:32", "chance to look inside the craft on only", "29:36", "one occasion and this was important", "29:38", "because where the reactor sat might have", "29:42", "been critical to how it operated since", "29:44", "everything operates without any", "29:46", "interconnections so the placement of", "29:48", "components might be critical so they", "29:51", "allowed me to go inside and and look at", "29:54", "it again I forgot where the hell I am so", "29:58", "you're going into this craft and what", "30:01", "are you thinking when you're inside of", "30:02", "it like what are you seeing it's a it's", "30:06", "a very ominous feeling because it's", "30:08", "there are no at first of all everything", "30:11", "is one color it's like a dark pewter", "30:13", "color and there are no right angles", "30:16", "anywhere it's as if somebody took I've", "30:20", "said this before somebody took a model", "30:22", "out of and fashioned it out of wax and", "30:25", "then heated it just for a short time so", "30:27", "everything melted everything looks like", "30:29", "it's fused together everything has a", "30:31", "radius of curvature were two items meet", "30:34", "it's it's a really weird looking thing", "30:38", "but there was almost nothing other than", "30:45", "a small foldable hatchway that that", "30:49", "looked recognizable everything was uh", "30:51", "was really unworldly to pick on it a way", "30:55", "to describe it so you you get inside", "30:58", "this thing and it's designed for", "31:00", "something that's much smaller than a", "31:01", "human being", "31:02", "yeah you can't really stand up till you", "31:03", "get to the very center of how tall you", "31:05", "I'm five ten", "31:07", "and what do you think this was designed", "31:09", "for I'd say something close to half my", "31:11", "height Wow so these little three-foot", "31:15", "tallest creatures yeah and that the", "31:18", "seats were small too I mean obviously it", "31:20", "was made you know for something", "31:21", "something small but there is no like", "31:25", "there's there's nothing else in there", "31:27", "there's just seats the reactor and some", "31:30", "of the sub components there's no there's", "31:31", "no control panels there's no bathroom", "31:34", "there's no no decorative components or", "31:37", "artwork or anything that you would", "31:39", "recognize or trim I mean it's just a", "31:42", "very bare-bones thing you're not seeing", "31:44", "any screens", "31:46", "well there are archways around it at", "31:49", "that a part of the superstructure and", "31:51", "that one of the archways can become", "31:54", "transparent when I was in there there", "31:57", "was another group working on one of the", "32:00", "archways and you could call that a", "32:02", "screen more or less so through that", "32:05", "archway it would be it would maintain", "32:08", "the solidity the the solid whatever", "32:12", "metal it was yeah but you could just", "32:14", "became transparent yeah I saw that", "32:17", "happen once or twice before I left", "32:19", "did you ask any questions about what the", "32:20", "phone no there's no ask question now but", "32:24", "when you watch something become", "32:25", "transparent and you realize it's still", "32:27", "there but you could now see through it", "32:29", "yeah I mean no that's not that", "32:31", "impressive we do have some liquid", "32:33", "crystal materials that are like that you", "32:35", "know smart glass yeah they call it smart", "32:38", "class so this is just and I don't know", "32:40", "if the craft is made of you know an", "32:43", "advanced metal or a ceramic it was cold", "32:46", "to the touch so um you know I would lean", "32:49", "more towards a metal you're not allowed", "32:50", "to ask questions no the only way work on", "32:54", "the buddy system so I can only exchange", "32:56", "ideas and talk to Barry now this really", "33:00", "interferes with science because science", "33:02", "is based on free discussion and ideally", "33:05", "you get a bunch of guys together", "33:06", "exchange ideas work on problems and", "33:08", "that's how things move forward but", "33:10", "they're so over-the-top concerned about", "33:13", "security they split everything off and", "33:16", "everybody becomes stagnant it it it", "33:21", "destroys any of the progress you can", "33:23", "make or at least makes it go so slow", "33:26", "they I think they wind up shooting", "33:28", "themselves in the foot which is probably", "33:30", "why they arrived at this bottleneck that", "33:33", "they need to get this madman with a", "33:35", "jet-powered Honda come in and see what", "33:37", "he could do I think that was an act of", "33:39", "desperation I think they wanted someone", "33:41", "that's thinks out of the box and let's", "33:43", "just give this guy a try here because", "33:45", "they weren't and they might have done", "33:47", "this four more times since you know up", "33:50", "to the point in time today assuming", "33:52", "they're still working on this thing and", "33:54", "when you see this craft and you're", "33:57", "inside was there any indication that", "34:00", "there was an area that they would use to", "34:02", "control it to pilot was there a pilot", "34:05", "seat whizzers", "34:07", "there were three seats they sat around", "34:08", "the reactor was in the dead center of it", "34:11", "and then equidistant around there were", "34:14", "three seats so that's all the there was", "34:18", "a large you would they're not consoles", "34:21", "there are large rectangular objects also", "34:23", "spaced equidistant around the center", "34:26", "there's nothing on them there's no", "34:28", "button that there's no lights and they", "34:30", "litter all same color this everything is", "34:32", "the same color different shape right and", "34:36", "directly underneath them there's three", "34:38", "levels in the craft the main level is", "34:41", "what we're talking about directly under", "34:43", "that those are the gravity amplifiers", "34:46", "the big rectangular objects underneath", "34:48", "them are the gravity of midders that", "34:50", "look like for lack of a better word a", "34:52", "trash can hanging on a pipe three of", "34:54", "those and then the top layer I this is", "34:58", "just my personal belief I think that has", "35:00", "to do with a navigation or their version", "35:04", "of a computer with some planar panels", "35:08", "sensor panels around the craft that we", "35:10", "would call portholes but they're not", "35:11", "portholes they're just black areas and I", "35:14", "think that just determines its you know", "35:17", "position in space but I was I was in the", "35:21", "center section and I stuck my torso in", "35:24", "the bottom section and hung upside down", "35:26", "so I could see how the gravity", "35:28", "amplifiers were positioned what is they", "35:30", "the roughly the size of this thing it's", "35:33", "I think it I don't", "35:34", "member from being there but after all", "35:38", "the stuff was over I had John Andrews a", "35:40", "guy from the testers model corporation", "35:43", "and you know we sat down and tried to", "35:45", "figure out from what I saw and known", "35:50", "sizes of things and we came up with 52", "35:52", "feet in diameter I think that's always", "35:55", "small yeah so I think that's a fair", "35:57", "reasonable guess now you said there's", "36:00", "nine of them and you got a brief glimpse", "36:02", "at the other ones were they how were", "36:04", "they different Oh", "36:05", "they looked completely different one", "36:08", "looked like I called a jello mold and it", "36:10", "it looked like a classic jello mold with", "36:12", "the rippled sides do it one was a very", "36:15", "flat disc you know like oh I don't like", "36:21", "a straw hat or something like that that", "36:23", "was sitting up on its edge and the thin", "36:25", "part of it had looked like a projectile", "36:28", "had been fired through the edge of it so", "36:31", "I don't know if they were attempting to", "36:33", "see if the metal could be penetrated or", "36:35", "if something or if that's where the", "36:38", "thing came from maybe it was shot down", "36:41", "but that was the only one where I saw", "36:43", "there was you know actual physical", "36:45", "damage to it and that one was roughly", "36:48", "the same size they're all high they were", "36:49", "kind of too far away to tell mm-hmm and", "36:52", "did there was several teams that were", "36:56", "working on the propulsion system so", "36:57", "there was different teams that were", "36:59", "working on these different our aircrafts", "37:01", "I I don't don't know I could only assume", "37:04", "now when you're sitting in this thing", "37:07", "and you're looking at this otherworldly", "37:11", "craft your your goal is to try to figure", "37:14", "out how this thing functions your goal", "37:16", "is to try to figure out how this reactor", "37:18", "I mean he would imagine they would give", "37:21", "you more time than just one day to check", "37:23", "that out oh yeah it wasn't one day right", "37:26", "yeah I mean this is Barry was there", "37:29", "I think Barry was sleeping there I'm", "37:31", "sure they had now that that isn't weird", "37:34", "I mean Oh put the Tonopah test range", "37:35", "where they work on stealth fighters you", "37:38", "know you go I think three weeks on one", "37:41", "week off and you stay up there too so", "37:43", "it's not weird to stay up with the test", "37:44", "site right so yeah you think he prettier", "37:47", "than he", "37:48", "did like he's been up there for a long", "37:50", "time yeah but I'm still there yeah oh no", "37:54", "so you do you have contact with this guy", "37:56", "no oh no I wish I did I kind of thought", "37:59", "he was gonna come out after I did right", "38:03", "and I think I took so much flak and it's", "38:06", "so much shit for what went on I think I", "38:09", "actually I wound up helping security", "38:11", "there and everybody became afraid of you", "38:14", "know doing or saying anything after that", "38:16", "so what kind of reports did you have to", "38:20", "give like so you're not making much", "38:21", "progress right you're just trying to", "38:23", "figure out what this thing is and it", "38:24", "seems impossible", "38:25", "so well we didn't personally make them I", "38:27", "mean we were always there was never a", "38:30", "lot of information that we gained the", "38:34", "guy you would call him our supervisor or", "38:37", "his name was Dennis Mariani and kind of", "38:40", "a military looking guy and he would", "38:42", "routinely pop in you know during the day", "38:45",

"38:55", "where we presented him the information", "38:57", "then he took it to wherever they were", "38:59", "you know assembling all the data from", "39:01", "everybody know I assume you're working", "39:03", "normal day so I can eight-hour day no no", "39:06", "no it was really weird that I would be", "39:09", "only called in on certain times in", "39:11", "certain days and they would be weird", "39:13", "hours too", "39:15", "most of the time was later in the", "39:16", "evening I mean I can get a call with 11", "39:18", "o'clock at night and they'll say you", "39:20", "know it's now 11 o'clock by 11:45 you", "39:25", "need to be at McCarran Terminal and you", "39:29", "know we'll let you know when we have", "39:31", "more information but what did you do", "39:33", "while you were there if you're looking", "39:36", "at this object this reactor and you", "39:39", "can't figure out what it is or how it", "39:41", "works other than the fact that works on", "39:43", "this element that we don't even know", "39:45", "about sure I mean the thing was - that", "39:47", "what you do and you know with anything", "39:51", "if you're trying to analyze it all you", "39:53", "can do is perform tests and all we did", "39:56", "is try and come up with every kind of", "39:58", "test we possibly could I mean we tested", "40:00", "you know", "40:02", "it violated a lot of what we thought was", "40:06", "impossible to violate I mean one of the", "40:08", "first laws of thermodynamics I mean", "40:10", "essentially any machine any device that", "40:13", "operates always makes

converted to heat", "40:25", "and it's just wasted this didn't I mean", "40:28", "we looked at back then we had infrared", "40:30", "cameras they're different today but back", "40:32", "then you had a pour liquid nitrogen into", "40:34", "the camera to cool the sensor down and", "40:37", "and get these infrared images you've", "40:40", "seen but it never got no matter what the", "40:43", "load was on the reactor it never got", "40:46", "above ambient temperature which is", "40:48", "impossible I mean you're you know", "40:51", "pulling out huge amounts of power and", "40:54", "nothing ever gets warm", "40:57", "we tried measuring magnetic fields and", "40:59", "there was was nothing there so we", "41:01", "started playing around with the emission", "41:04", "from the emitter is the gravity wave", "41:06", "itself and saw what we could do with it", "41:09", "and how it was focused so we really", "41:12", "spent all our time just trying to see", "41:15", "what the stuff can do and what we can", "41:18", "control so you were seeing what it could", "41:20", "do but you couldn't ever figure out how", "41:22", "it was doing it no not really I mean we", "41:25", "really we really could only use a come", "41:28", "up with a best guess and now I can't say", "41:32", "we really I that I could absolutely", "41:35", "state for certainly very certainty how", "41:38", "anything actually worked now how did you", "41:43", "know at all how they were piloting it", "41:45", "because some they were doing some tests", "41:48", "where they were having these things fly", "41:51", "around in the sky and this is what gets", "41:55", "us deeper into your story", "41:56", "right I was out there for one test right", "42:05", "in fact I was in with Barry in the lab", "42:08", "and Dennis came in and said we're about", "42:11", "to run a test why don't you guys come", "42:13", "out or I think he said Barry wedding", "42:16", "you come out here and bring Bob with you", "42:18", "we went out there and the craft was", "42:22", "already outside the hangar and was just", "42:25", "preparing to lift off now they were in", "42:28", "communication with somebody in the craft", "42:30", "so there was a person in there", "42:31", "yeah there was certainly a person in", "42:34", "there now it's not a comfortable place", "42:36", "to be in because it's small so the guy", "42:39", "has to be sitting on the floor in the", "42:40", "middle my best guess and this is the", "42:43", "same specific craft that you know that", "42:45", "was because you were the that was the", "42:46", "only craft that you were the only one", "42:47", "that I touched and worked on and it it", "42:51", "quietly lifted off the ground which", "42:53", "wasn't incredibly impressive to see", "42:55", "quietly or silently what's well quietly", "43:00", "because it it produced a little Corona", "43:06", "discharge from the bottom a corona", "43:08", "discharge is kind of a high voltage", "43:09", "brush little bluish glow discharge as it", "43:13", "was lifting off the ground you can hear", "43:14", "a slight hiss sound now as soon as it", "43:16", "cleared the ground by about five or ten", "43:18", "feet maybe even less than that the", "43:20", "hissing stopped and the blue go", "43:22", "disappeared so it lifted off quietly and", "43:26", "then it hovered silently if you want to", "43:28", "be specific Wow so then what kind of", "43:31", "maneuvers was it doing it took for that", "43:34", "particular time it took off moved a", "43:37", "little round around to the left and", "43:38", "right and then sat back down the the", "43:42", "craft itself they communicated with it", "43:47", "with a rake because I saw the guy", "43:49", "talking and a regular VHF radio to the", "43:55", "person in the craft and I even saw the", "43:57", "frequency that was on the frequency", "44:00", "counter of the communication the", "44:02", "transceiver there but what's weird is he", "44:07", "shouldn't be able to communicate with", "44:09", "the craft with a radio the radio the", "44:13", "radio waves should Bend around the craft", "44:15", "I mean it shouldn't be possible every", "44:17", "single thing about these the craft and", "44:20", "the way they operated didn't make any", "44:23", "sense to us I mean that's something we", "44:25", "talked about for a while after why", "44:27", "should the frequency Bend around the", "44:29", "craft", "44:29", "well you really have to look at the way", "44:32", "the gravity wave comes out of the craft", "44:35", "as a the reactors in the center and", "44:37", "there's a waveguide that goes up to the", "44:39", "top there's actually a small appendage", "44:41", "that sticks out at the top of the craft", "44:42", "and it produces a heart-shaped", "44:44", "gravitational distortion around the", "44:46", "craft now if the craft is sitting in the", "44:49", "air and you walk underneath it and look", "44:51", "up you actually cannot see the craft the", "44:56", "light bends around it you're bending", "44:58", "gravity bends light it bends radio waves", "45:01", "it's um it it shouldn't be possible to", "45:06", "communicate with a craft that has an", "45:07", "envelope around it that's distorting all", "45:10", "forms of energy but they were apparently", "45:14", "in contact with it somehow or another", "45:15", "through some unexplained way but they", "45:18", "bother explain to you so this thing gets", "45:21", "up it just does some very simple", "45:23", "maneuvers left-right left-right Goes", "45:24", "Down and did they discuss this with you", "45:29", "I mean they said they wanted you to see", "45:30", "it no they just wanted no they didn't", "45:33", "discuss anything with me it said it sat", "45:35", "down we looked around for a bit and", "45:37", "Barry said let's go back we went back in", "45:39", "the lab all we got to do is see it fast", "45:43", "forward to some months later I did have", "45:48", "the test flight schedule of the craft", "45:50", "now they had times they had designated", "45:52", "high performance tests this obviously", "45:55", "wasn't one that was a high performance", "45:58", "test the high performance test went goes", "46:00", "above the mountain range and they do", "46:03", "much more radical moves with the thing", "46:05", "look this is a prized item and they're", "46:09", "not doing anything like taking it out of", "46:10", "the atmosphere or flying around other", "46:12", "countries or anything like this", "46:13", "they just play with this thing right", "46:15", "over the test site but they were doing", "46:18", "some radical moves with it and since I", "46:20", "had the test flight scheduled", "46:22", "statistically the amount of traffic and", "46:27", "the surrounding areas on the highway was", "46:29", "lowest on Wednesdays and that's why", "46:32", "Denny Dennis told us that all the test", "46:35", "flights occurred only on Wednesdays", "46:37", "because it'd be the least chance that", "46:39", "anyone would see what's going on and", "46:41", "this was before the", "46:43", "the government had expanded the", "46:45", "forbidden territory around area 51 and", "46:49", "Papoose Lake and all that stuff right", "46:50", "yeah I think that occurred after my", "46:54", "story came out then people started going", "46:56", "up on the mountaintops and trying to", "46:58", "look down into there", "47:00", "and they kind of freaked out and then", "47:01", "did the land grab and pushed everybody", "47:04", "back but yeah that I think all that", "47:06", "occurred long after I'm sorry that I", "47:09", "came out so you're working there and", "47:13", "while you're working there you're under", "47:14", "this crazy schedule but forgive me for", "47:17", "explaining your story but you would get", "47:20", "these phone calls you would have to go", "47:22", "to the to the airport at 11:00 p.m. and", "47:27", "your wife started thinking that you were", "47:29", "having an affair yeah apparently so now", "47:33", "I did give my permission to have you", "47:36", "know as part of the you know security", "47:39", "clearance process", "47:41", "I gave written permission to have the", "47:43", "phones monitored and things of that sort", "47:45", "so they weren't doing any covert stuff", "47:47", "they you know with any Q clearance tour", "47:51", "which is civilian top secret clearance", "47:53", "or military top secret clearance they go", "47:55", "talk to friends and you know play places", "47:59", "you've been make sure you're not", "48:00", "connected to foreign countries but you", "48:02", "know monitoring your phone is nothing", "48:03", "unusual", "48:04", "however they insisted that you know you", "48:09", "don't even talk to your loved one to", "48:11", "your partner to your wife whatever about", "48:13", "what's going on so she was essentially", "48:15", "in the dark and didn't know the phone", "48:18", "was being monitored well part of the", "48:21", "security clearance is that not only do", "48:25", "you not have any connections to foreign", "48:26", "countries and are in a maniac but you", "48:28", "have to have a stable home life - well", "48:31", "she started having an affair with a", "48:33", "flight instructor now they were", "48:35", "monitoring this on the phone and they", "48:37", "knew it and I didn't so they stopped me", "48:40", "coming in and their attitude at the time", "48:43", "was we need to see how this is going to", "48:46", "play out", "48:47", "and if Lazar is gonna get a little weird", "48:50", "or anything so let's just you know hold", "48:53", "him off from coming in and you", "48:57", "see what happens and they explain this", "48:58", "to you what was happening well after the", "49:01", "fact yeah cuz time kind of went on and", "49:04", "there were guys that were following me", "49:06", "around and I started getting a little", "49:08", "concerned going well shitter they booted", "49:12", "me out of the project and if so they're", "49:16", "not just gonna let me hang out at home", "49:18", "and go get a new job knowing what I know", "49:20", "so as time went on I started getting a", "49:24", "little concerned and I took my closest", "49:27", "friends and just kind of got together I", "49:29", "said hey remember that job I told you", "49:32", "about this is what's going on and like", "49:36", "you don't need to take my word for it", "49:38", "Wednesday night we need to all go out", "49:41", "here I want to show you what's going on", "49:42", "so I took everybody and we went out to", "49:45", "remember since I had the test flight", "49:47", "scheduled and went outside the base out", "49:51", "into the desert and so everybody could", "49:53", "see you know one of the high performance", "49:55", "tests and you know it left quite an", "49:58", "imprint on everybody so they knew I", "50:00", "wasn't and there's videos of these tests", "50:02", "right yeah but remember this isn't that", "50:04", "it's in in the dark in the 80s of the", "50:07", "big monster sized camcorder and you got", "50:09", "you know a bright light jumping around", "50:11", "but yeah I mean we did video of a but", "50:14", "there's no by today's standards it's but", "50:17", "it's your video specifically available", "50:19", "the video that you took", "50:20", "yeah well George Knapp has it it's is it", "50:23", "an argument now do you I have no idea", "50:25", "Jeremy yeah show clips of it in my film", "50:27", "it's it's online and someone did a deep", "50:29", "analysis of it it was interesting to", "50:31", "take a look at how well this microphone", "50:34", "up to face about a fish from your face", "50:35", "right you know to see how his video", "50:38", "looks now but as far as video evidence I", "50:41", "mean we are talking 80s camp words the", "50:43", "most important thing is the human story", "50:45", "here everybody that he took up there on", "50:47", "three separate occasions they don't all", "50:49", "like each other they don't all talk they", "50:52", "all agree on one thing they saw", "50:54", "something that night at the exact point", "50:56", "in time and space that Bob Lazar said", "50:58", "and remember this is 1715 seventy miles", "51:00", "south of area 51 no one even knew really", "51:02", "about area 51 we're talking Papoose Lake", "51:05", "and they all agree they saw something", "51:07", "that night they had never seen before", "51:08", "and they've", "51:09", "ever seen sense right when he said it so", "51:11", "that's one of like the six things where", "51:13", "I'm like how did he know you can dismiss", "51:15", "him I dismiss it but some things we", "51:18", "can't get around and and there's about", "51:20", "five or six of them how did he know", "51:22", "about if Jamie wants to find that video", "51:23", "right now what would you look under Bob", "51:26", "Lazar UFO s for area 51 just kind of", "51:31", "like that so it's like this s for UFO", "51:34", "video bob lazar and god does an analysis", "51:36", "but you're analyzing these 80's videos", "51:40", "he from the very beginning Bob never", "51:42", "said I have proof of my store and I'm", "51:45", "going to tell the world he said at the", "51:47", "very beginning I cannot prove my story", "51:49", "that's not why I'm telling this George", "51:52", "Knapp convinced him to tell people and", "51:54", "he lived to it and I I didn't believe it", "51:56", "either until I talked with George okay", "51:59", "so you you filmed these this test flight", "52:03", "one test flight and then you get caught", "52:06", "actually it was I think the third time", "52:09", "because we went out there the first time", "52:12", "mmm", "52:13", "everybody saw it everybody was amazed", "52:15", "because it did some radical maneuvers", "52:17", "and you know everybody had a lot to say", "52:20", "but new vers that i've seen i've seen", "52:21", "the video it doesn't I don't think", "52:24", "there's something we have now that does", "52:25", "that know in terms of like a human", "52:27", "piloted craft I mean I don't know", "52:30", "obviously with the governor it's", "52:32", "impossible nothing can move like that", "52:34", "and remember we didn't start filming", "52:36", "from the very beginning you know at the", "52:38", "core we were waiting for something you", "52:40", "know to happen the craft took off and I", "52:42", "came flying at a stopped you know turned", "52:44", "it or I angle flew back and then you", "52:46", "know after did some you know amazing", "52:48", "stuff to get the camera and then we", "52:50", "started filming so it doesn't have all", "52:52", "of it on there just has some the way I", "52:55", "describe it to my friends and they said", "52:56", "what is I said take a laser pointer and", "52:59", "then have a wall and then move it around", "53:01", "the wall like you know how it moves", "53:02", "around the wall it doesn't seem like it", "53:04", "has anything to do with inertia or", "53:06", "physics or it's not an impeded in any", "53:08", "way by the atmosphere yeah that's what", "53:10", "it looked at you're essentially", "53:11", "separated from reality as crazy as that", "53:14", "sounds with being in in case its own", "53:17", "gravitational envelope inertia is not", "53:21", "going to affect it and you know this is", "53:24", "this is how some of those recent", "53:26", "sightings would commander David flavor", "53:28", "I'm sure you've heard of this exact you", "53:30", "a UFO I mean he describes exactly that", "53:33", "the thing operates exactly the way I was", "53:35", "describing that's why he was interested", "53:38", "to talk to me but we saw this and you", "53:43", "know on the way home it's like way we", "53:45", "got away with it we should try it again", "53:47", "the next test flight day so this became", "53:50", "a thing to do and I think it was on the", "53:53", "third time that we got caught I mean we", "53:56", "started becoming a little careless I", "53:58", "think we took a Motorhome out there you", "54:01", "know I mean it was like the stupidest", "54:03", "thing you could possibly tell Gaytan", "54:05", "yeah it was ridiculous and again you're", "54:08", "in your 20s yeah and you know what was", "54:10", "funny was we went out there and my", "54:15", "friend Jean Huff and I were leaning on", "54:17", "the front of a vehicle and just for some", "54:21", "reason we just started talking jet like", "54:24", "well I hope they realized that I don't", "54:29", "remember what we were saying but you", "54:31", "know that it's something about attacking", "54:34", "the base or something along those lines", "54:36", "and stealing the craft or something like", "54:38", "that so I'm crazy and then about 20 feet", "54:42", "in front of us we see a little green", "54:44", "light fall on the ground and roll to us", "54:47", "and unbeknownst to us now it's pitch", "54:49", "black you can't see your hand in front", "54:51", "of your face there are a bunch of guards", "54:53", "standing right out there and they had a", "54:55", "night-vision scope where they were like", "54:57", "from here to the wall looking at us", "54:59", "listening to us and the guy dropped it", "55:00", "and the scope rolled over to us and you", "55:02", "could see the green screen we turned the", "55:05", "lights on and all these guys are there", "55:07", "so it was whoa yeah yeah so we did", "55:11", "incredibly stupid stuff and got caught", "55:12", "as we should have because so when they", "55:14", "catch you and they bring you in then", "55:15", "what happens well I went in for", "55:17", "debriefing the following day I went to", "55:20", "Indian Springs Air Force Base which is", "55:22", "kind of a defunct base that they used to", "55:26", "use at the nuclear test site and this is", "55:29", "when they brought out the transcript of", "55:33", "the phone call with my wife", "55:36", "and you know they sat me down and we", "55:38", "said you know when we meant to keep the", "55:40", "secret we meant you can't tell your", "55:42", "friends right you know and it just being", "55:45", "sarcastic and trying to mmm and then", "55:48", "they got real serious but this is where", "55:51", "they you know took the transcript out", "55:53", "and we're reading me what my wife and", "55:58", "you know our friend we're talking about", "56:00", "and it was our dime so what happens from", "56:05", "there what do they do with you", "56:09", "why don't they arrest you I don't think", "56:11", "I don't know I don't know why I'm not", "56:13", "sure they exactly they knew what to do", "56:15", "but they did let me go that night and I", "56:19", "went home and that this is kind of when", "56:22", "the most stressful part started because", "56:24", "you're realizing you're being bombed", "56:25", "yeah no yeah now I know not only am I", "56:28", "being monitored but now I know I'm in", "56:30", "trouble and it wasn't a short time after", "56:33", "that that I contacted you know at that", "56:36", "time the only investigative reporter I", "56:38", "had heard of in Las Vegas was George", "56:40", "Knapp and you know told him some of the", "56:43", "story because I had no idea what the", "56:45", "hell was gonna happen at that point so", "56:47", "George Knapp tries to dissect your story", "56:51", "tries to find holes in it tells it puts", "56:55", "it online and makes everybody aware of", "56:56", "it and that's how I found out about it", "56:58", "yeah to make a long story short well", "57:00", "what happens yet to really make a long", "57:03", "story short what happens from there on I", "57:05", "mean do they contact you and say hey Bob", "57:07", "it's probably a good idea if you shut up", "57:11", "how they try to label you as crazy was", "57:15", "there there a boy there are a lot of", "57:19", "things that happened at you know between", "57:21", "that point I'm leaving out a lot of", "57:24", "stuff to fill in the story we'd have to", "57:29", "go back to Los Alamos and and well I", "57:33", "really don't want to talk about that the", "57:36", "top-secret weapons stuff that you were", "57:39", "working on", "57:40", "no I'm talking about the 115 um well I", "57:46", "don't know I have to think about how", "57:48", "what is the problem I don't want to get", "57:54", "myself into more trouble by admitting", "57:56", "something so I just have to dance around", "57:59", "a

and", "62:52", "that we're getting great data from from", "62:55", "visual pilots to to radar that's why we", "62:57", "know it's aerospace they dropped from", "62:58", "80,000 feet but guess what that's the", "63:00", "top scope of the spy-1 radar is 80,000", "63:04", "feet so the radar system they were using", "63:06", "it was coming from above that so my", "63:08", "point is this if you

here is just that we have to", "63:46", "now look at Bob's story but knowing the", "63:49", "facts not someone saying it's a bird", "63:52", "it's a plane it's a glitch they're not", "63:54", "and so if you don't know that you just", "63:56", "don't have the information yeah I'm not", "63:58", "just that knowing the facts as we know", "63:59", "him in 2019 not 1988 absolutely and so", "64:04", "what is he said that has come true he's", "64:06", "totally unimpressed with it right what", "64:08", "does he said this come true so I was", "64:10", "like Bob they've announced gravity as a", "64:12", "wave you were right and you're", "64:14", "vindicated and he looks at mean he's", "64:16", "like well if you think about it Jeremy I", "64:18", "had like a 50-50 chance he was not very", "64:21", "impressed right when did they announce", "64:23", "gravity as a wave so they detected in a", "64:26", "sense they attempted gravity waves now", "64:28", "who is they", "64:30", "you might know more there's two black", "64:31", "holes that were colliding and that's how", "64:33", "they were able to detect yeah somebody", "64:35", "bill I don't know which group it was or", "64:37", "what part of the government", "64:38", "that's what Google's fourth yeah what it", "64:41", "but they you know built a gigantic", "64:43", "gravity wave detector and pretty much", "64:46", "detected that there are such things as", "64:49", "first observation of gravitational waves", "64:52", "it says it was in 2016", "64:56", "ok the first observation of", "64:57", "gravitational waves was made on

that I mean", "65:48", "yes no he was on in the 80s the", "65:51", "predominant theory was gravity is", "65:53", "produced by gravitons okay you know part", "65:55", "of theoretical particles but they're not", "65:59", "they're waves they're not particles and", "66:01", "that's so the thought is that the way we", "66:04", "experience gravity it's based on mass", "66:06", "which is why the moon

Victorian era I love that that", "66:59", "analogy because back then that was", "67:02", "impossible that was magic but you're", "67:05", "talking about here the fact that they", "67:07", "just discovered this four years ago that", "67:10", "this is a wave but we're as much as we", "67:13", "know and as impressed as we are as we", "67:15", "should be with how much more", "67:17",

things have been around", "67:38", "than us who knows what their", "67:40", "evolutionary cycles been who knows what", "67:42", "I mean we might be talking about", "67:44", "something that's a million years more", "67:45", "advanced than us yeah yeah it could", "67:47", "easily be now I'm not in believe it or", "67:51", "not I'm not into UFOs I don't follow", "67:53", "stories or you know even after your", "67:55", "experiences no I'm fascinated with the", "67:58", "technology and I it really it works me", "68:01", "like every night I go to sleep that you", "68:03", "know I don't that it was my own doing", "68:07", "essentially that that prevented me from", "68:10", "continuing on in the in the project I", "68:12", "mean it's a that to be on that cutting", "68:15", "edge of technology is so alluring to me", "68:18", "right but you know by the same token I", "68:22", "don't really care that there's aliens or", "68:24", "where they come from I mean the prize is", "68:26", "the technology and that's what I'm", "68:27", "fascinated by but so I don't listen to", "68:29", "UFO stories and that sort of thing but", "68:31", "George Knapp is I mean he's the guy that", "68:34", "has the contacts and tries to thread", "68:37", "everything together and what he recently", "68:40", "told me as he found I don't know is", "68:43", "either documentation or people that he", "68:44", "spoke to it's at this the existence of", "68:47", "this project the project that I was on", "68:48", "it's something that they seemed to take", "68:53", "out every eight or ten years so that's a", "68:55", "very specific memo and", "68:57", "this is actually I this is the first", "68:59", "time I'll be very clear with people", "69:00", "about it it's a big topic of", "69:01", "conversation right now it's called the", "69:03", "Wilson memo you can look it up", "69:06", "Admiral Wilson met with a scientist", "69:09", "who's actually was featured in one of my", "69:10", "films", "69:11", "everybody has been debating whether or", "69:13", "not this document of a conversation with", "69:17", "a with an sitting Admiral at the time is", "69:19", "a real document it's an actual", "69:22", "conversation that happened and this", "69:23", "document is right but he wants to know", "69:24", "the world is going crazy right now in", "69:26", "the UFO world I'll tell you straight up", "69:28", "right now I'm in the position to know", "69:30", "and it is a real document that it is", "69:34", "real so the conversation you read in", "69:36", "that that conversation was had I can't", "69:39", "attest to every you're not being very", "69:41", "clear sure please no problem so there", "69:44", "was a document is circulating right now", "69:46", "that is really big it's going around", "69:48", "everywhere people are asking what is", "69:49", "this document it's called the Wilson", "69:52", "memo is what how you can find it online", "69:53", "though or the Wilson leak there's", "69:56", "Jimmy's got it the Wilson memorandum use", "69:59", "of human vu Admiral Wilson meets with", "70:06", "this scientist and they have this", "70:08", "discussion oddly enough that special", "70:10", "projects at EG&G and if I remember the", "70:12", "document from 2001 I'm telling everybody", "70:14", "right now it's real and we'll see my", "70:17", "history is pretty good would like to say", "70:18", "and if something is real or not right so", "70:20", "here we go the document comes out they", "70:22", "meet at EG&G special projects in 1989", "70:25", "they stumble into a problem this happens", "70:29", "they put the technology away and then", "70:32", "they bring it back out and see if the", "70:33", "material science has caught up and if", "70:36", "they can make any progress so this", "70:38", "document kind of talks about this", "70:39", "process the big thing I get from it and", "70:41", "a lot of its vindicating to Bob and one", "70:44", "of the things that's vindicating besides", "70:45", "the EG&G thing is that private industry", "70:48", "so this guy's an admiral and he says I", "70:51", "found out about your essay P your", "70:53", "special access program I need to know", "70:56", "about it and he's going to a a private", "70:58", "part of Industry and he is denied access", "71:01", "and he says uh you know I should be", "71:04", "running this program and they were able", "71:06", "to deny him access so I think the", "71:09", "takeaway here is", "71:11", "get out I'm telling you that that is an", "71:12", "actual correct that is a leak now", "71:15", "everything said in that document and I", "71:16", "don't know what are you talking about", "71:18", "what what is said in that document it's", "71:20", "it's a between a scientist and an", "71:22", "admiral that are sitting and they're", "71:23", "having a meeting and they're talking", "71:25", "about the the search for the the UFO", "71:28", "subject the search to get special access", "71:31", "program access to all of these different", "71:33", "things like reverse engineering programs", "71:36", "so in this document they talk about it I", "71:40", "believe that the this document that the", "71:43", "person that went was employed by Robert", "71:44", "Bigelow you know one of the guys has a", "71:46", "couple of orbiting satellites and all", "71:47", "that stuff he's a guy owned skinwalker", "71:49", "ranch no he's not he was the guy okay", "71:54", "yeah he used to own it there's a new", "71:55", "owner and I interview him for my other", "71:58", "film but there's a new owner and you'll", "72:00", "be hearing a lot more about that soon", "72:02", "but uh like it'll just there's their", "72:04", "stuff that you'll be hearing about", "72:05", "skinwalker ranch soon because there's a", "72:07", "new owner anyway the whole point of this", "72:09", "in you know insertion here is just that", "72:11", "that document kind of validates a lot of", "72:15", "this idea Bob just said that they make a", "72:18", "little progress then they can't go", "72:20", "anywhere they tuck it away and then they", "72:22", "bring it back out you know ten years", "72:23", "later and start working on it what is", "72:26", "the limiting factor I think Bob should", "72:27", "speak on this but it's the material", "72:29", "science yeah it's really where physics", "72:32", "is so I can I can see them doing that I", "72:34", "mean I didn't have any information on", "72:38", "that but I think what you know Georgia", "72:40", "uncovered is probably accurate that you", "72:43", "know we try and do what we can and once", "72:45", "we reach a roadblock on we really can't", "72:47", "figure it out it's just friggin wait put", "72:51", "the thing away wait for science to catch", "72:53", "up and you know a decade later let's", "72:55", "take the project out again and see all", "72:57", "right now where can we go but there's", "72:59", "got to be someone who remains informed", "73:01", "right oh yeah I've got your scientists", "73:03", "like you and Barry you got you people", "73:06", "that you compartmentalize you've got", "73:07", "these people working there has to be", "73:08", "some people right that know everything", "73:11", "you've got security and then someone's", "73:13", "gonna be on the outside saying hey we", "73:15", "need people to guard this building don't", "73:17", "let anybody in for 10 years I said yeah", "73:19", "I think a lot of that is private", "73:21", "industry and I think that's how they", "73:22", "keep it yeah I think that's how they", "73:24", "litter pick", "73:24", "the government is just so leaky I think", "73:27", "that's kind of what their dough is what", "73:29", "the document kind of proves you just", "73:31", "articulated that that it is in control", "73:33", "private industry what private industry", "73:35", "some aerospace company something I don't", "73:38", "know yeah they wouldn't they would the", "73:39", "guy would the Admiral wouldn't name it", "73:40", "in the car in the conversation yeah so", "73:43", "they still have these things supposedly", "73:47", "I would guess I mean I don't have any", "73:50", "information have you ever asked anyone", "73:53", "that has any inkling of any idea of", "73:57", "where they got them or how they got them", "73:59", "no but something must have been said to", "74:03", "me from Barry and but I Ike it was just", "74:08", "too long ago and I I can't quite", "74:10", "remember it was said but it it just left", "74:12", "a seed in my mind I think at least one", "74:14", "of them was part of an archeological dig", "74:17", "so it's old something one at least one", "74:22", "of them is old I don't know if it was", "74:23", "the one I worked on but I remember", "74:25", "something to do with an archaeological", "74:27", "dig whoa so that's that means it's not", "74:31", "just old it's ancient they'll be a great", "74:32", "Steven Spielberg movie as all of it", "74:37", "would yeah that came out when he said", "74:39", "that for the first time no that's a", "74:41", "freak out right yeah Harrods with some", "74:43", "brushes looking for a Tyrannosaurus Rex", "74:45", "bone hit metal and when did they find it", "74:48", "you know that they have nine of them", "74:50", "well and how could we have not heard", "74:52", "about that what about the guys with the", "74:54", "brushes how could you uncover something", "74:56", "like that and with Joe's newspaper at", "74:58", "home does I mean they said it on that", "75:00", "first day oh you mean the Roswell yeah", "75:02", "yeah I have a cover", "75:04", "what is this is the document but I had", "75:07", "to do some digging to find it yes it's", "75:09", "just kind of yes so this is where they", "75:11", "meet at EG&G and this is Admiral Wilson", "75:13", "and there's a lot more coming out now I", "75:14", "want to be clear George didn't put this", "75:16", "out he didn't leak

right you remember", "75:28", "when he had that government contract", "75:29", "called hop the world all knows about now", "75:31", "and he had knids it studied the ranch", "75:33", "that 22 million everybody is saying it", "75:35", "was for a tip advanced aerospace", "75:38", "identification program the 22 million", "75:41", "dollars was for all SAP that was pushed", "75:44", "through through

every year than", "75:53", "they do studying UFOs if it was just", "75:55", "this program which I think is funny more", "75:58", "money from France they probably do them", "75:59", "UFOs well you never know how it seeds in", "76:01", "a population but anyway this program", "76:04", "this is what was the mother program so", "76:07", "it it got the 22 million and really it", "76:09", "was to study skinwalker ranch oddly", "76:11", "enough that 22 million all was inspired", "76:14", "by the phenomenon they were seen at", "76:15", "skinwalker ranch because the scientists", "76:17", "they're seeing vehicles come through", "76:20", "like a space in the sky yeah we went", "76:23", "there I went yeah you interviewed a", "76:26", "bunch of people that seemed full of shit", "76:28", "but a couple didn't but this very very", "76:30", "interesting totally and there's a bit in", "76:32", "if you look I spent a lot of time in the", "76:34", "area I'm not talking about those stories",

whatever", "76:43", "whatever the point is that 22 million", "76:45", "was to study that then we have a tip", "76:47", "which is like an auxilary kind of", "76:49", "program of military settings

you have to do from here", "77:42", "on out yeah well I mean the way it ended", "77:46", "was I told George Knapp all this stuff", "77:50", "and you know he said well let's", "77:52", "just get it on tape should something", "77:54", "happen at least we have a record of it", "77:56", "and I don't remember what the impetus", "77:59", "was but at some point George wanted to", "78:02", "air it and he said you know you make the", "78:05", "call on it and look if at any point you", "78:09", "change your mind", "78:10", "we won't air it and it came down to the", "78:13", "day where George wants to

know you got to", "78:23", "keep the technology secret but you can't", "78:25", "not tell everybody that this stuff is", "78:27", "going on that we have you know actual", "78:30", "hardware from another civilization it's", "78:32", "a big fucking deal you know probably the", "78:34", "biggest one there ever was and George", "78:39", "said you know today's the day we got to", "78:42", "put it on the news or something to that", "78:44", "effect and when it came right down to", "78:46", "the time to air it I changed my mind and", "78:48", "I said we're not doing it and that's", "78:52",

something that we", "82:28", "don't know there's something we don't", "82:30", "understand there's something that came", "82:32", "from another world we got it tucked away", "82:33", "in the mountains

else yeah you says you have", "82:59", "these objects fine with impunity right", "83:01", "and yes someone else well not only that", "83:03", "what can you say like how much do you", "83:05", "really know I think it's mainly the tech", "83:07", "knowledge that they just want to keep", "83:08", "the technology secret because there's", "83:11", "yeah whoever gets this yeah you you", "83:14",

know at", "84:19", "some point there was intense cooperation", "84:21", "with Raymond even exchanging some ideas", "84:24", "on nuclear weapons and you know EMP", "84:26", "tests and some things we would never", "84:28", "have discussed with them but at the same", "84:30", "time it was in the late 80s they were", "84:32", "involved", "84:33", "actually in the area at s4 with us and", "84:37", "guts communicate with these guys are you", "84:39", "solving no I knew they were there berry", "84:41", "berry would talk about the commies that", "84:43", "were there the counties and that was", "84:46", "back when they were the Commons yes", "84:47", "there were real commies and at some", "84:53", "point it wasn't our group but at some", "84:55", "point there was a big discovery made and", "84:58", "this did not happen when I was there it", "85:01", "happened in between my trips to there", "85:02", "and after that apparently they decided", "85:05", "it was just too cool to share with", "85:07", "anybody and the Russians were never", "85:09", "allowed back on the base after that but", "85:11", "you don't know what that discovery was", "85:12", "no no I said it wasn't my group so one", "85:14", "of the other groups really found out", "85:17", "something but the you know in typical", "85:20", "American fashion is all right this as", "85:22", "our as you guys get the hell out here", "85:24", "was there any inkling that any other", "85:26", "government had something similar", "85:29", "no no nothing that I had her see that", "85:31", "was the thing that always freaked me out", "85:33", "was why if if something was so superior", "85:36", "to human beings it's almost like", "85:38", "visiting an ant colony like why would", "85:40", "you go to the Queen I don't give a fuck", "85:42", "who the queen is I'm a human I'm so", "85:44", "superior to you ants I don't care who", "85:45", "you have running your hive I'm just", "85:47", "gonna study it I think it's who got it", "85:49", "who got it look at the you know rocket", "85:52", "technology in Germany but they got nine", "85:54", "of them yeah that doesn't make sense to", "85:57", "me either so they were either in the", "85:59", "same area or you know one had clues to", "86:03", "where others were I mean I don't know", "86:05", "you you have to fill that in there but", "86:07", "you're right I mean nine of them that's", "86:08", "a that that's a a big dig if it was", "86:11", "archeological well one of the more", "86:13", "recent the recent sightings and these", "86:16", "discussions that have been coming out", "86:18", "recently from Air Force pilots and Navy", "86:21", "pilots they've been talking about things", "86:22", "happening in the ocean and that that", "86:24", "something go literally goes into the", "86:27", "water or something maybe below the", "86:29", "surface think about water 2004 tick-tack", "86:31", "Nimitz case so that's when George Knapp", "86:33", "and I broke on the radio twice before", "86:34", "the New York Times said no this one", "86:36", "really well commander favor and those", "86:38", "pilots there was a disturbance on the", "86:41", "surface of the water", "86:43", "commander flavor visually saw what", "86:45", "looked like similar to", "86:47", "across some object so it's like as if", "86:49", "you have some a coral under the water", "86:51", "and you've got it's breaking over right", "86:53", "the tic-tac is doing this crazy maneuver", "86:55", "that defies it's a gravity propelled", "86:57", "says they saw it in the sky before they", "86:59", "saw in the water right yeah so there", "87:01", "were there were radar that was picking", "87:03", "this these things coming down from", "87:04", "80,000 feet drop into 50 feet in less", "87:06", "than a second this is it this is", "87:09", "actually on the news today there was a", "87:11", "briefing so a lot of people get this", "87:12", "confused I did not this one none either", "87:14", "no so that is called the gimbal so", "87:17", "there's three videos released by the", "87:19", "Pentagon that are all after shoe light", "87:21", "and keep the volume on fire", "87:22", "I would I would really just pay", "87:24", "attention to the source video so you've", "87:26", "got the tic-tac which is this object the", "87:28", "commander flavor saw another pilot", "87:30", "filmed it with a FLIR pod and it goes to", "87:33", "but this one you see is really important", "87:35", "to Bob's story the gimbal craft it's", "87:38", "been recently analyzed it's FLIR not", "87:41", "only does it its definitive that it's", "87:44", "not conventional anything by the by its", "87:47", "movements but there's a pocket of cold", "87:48", "air around a propulsion source so this", "87:52", "object by the way sat stationary for", "87:55", "days if not weeks it's at stationary you", "87:58", "know they found it 11 hours later and", "88:00", "they were saying there's no way this", "88:01", "thing using that kind of energy to go", "88:03", "that fast could just hover the amount of", "88:05", "time and by the way you're seeing a very", "88:07", "small part of what happened that day", "88:09", "this object was not alone and so", "88:12", "hopefully that information comes out and", "88:15", "we can I mean I wish we had video of it", "88:17", "I'm sure we'd all want to see it but", "88:19", "that's called the gimbal that was East", "88:21", "Coast right 2015 West Coast 2004 was the", "88:26", "tick-tack the disturbance on the water", "88:29", "commander flavor believes there was", "88:30", "something under that water that was", "88:32", "causing that disturbance when the", "88:33", "tic-tock was coming around to do in it", "88:35", "with inside the the people that are", "88:37", "studying this they're thinking maybe the", "88:39", "tic-tac system was causing the", "88:41", "disturbance but the USO unidentified", "88:44", "submerged object that he visually saw", "88:47", "the whole interesting thing about that", "88:50", "is I would love Bob to describe it is", "88:52", "why it doesn't matter if these craft are", "88:54", "in space air or water why doesn't it", "88:58", "matter I love when he talks about this", "88:59", "shit", "89:00", "well first of all commander flavor was", "89:02", "the f-18 pilot off the Nimitz that was", "89:05", "sent out to find out what this stuff is", "89:07", "but and it wasn't just I got a chance to", "89:10", "talk to him recently and it wasn't just", "89:13", "a radar image", "89:14", "I mean commander flavor had eyes on it", "89:16", "for over five minutes watching this", "89:19", "thing as four other pilots did so this", "89:21", "wasn't a radar blip or anything I mean", "89:23", "these guys were watching this thing but", "89:26", "you know one of the things I think in", "89:29", "the gimbal video the way the craft that", "89:33", "we worked on flies is it doesn't fly", "89:38", "like conventional aircraft does and it", "89:41", "doesn't fly like a flying saucer Witter", "89:43", "in a 1950s movie it flies belly-first", "89:47", "I mean it may set down conventionally", "89:50", "but it always rotates it doesn't roll", "89:53", "maneuver puts its belly towards the", "89:55", "target and then moves your car flying", "89:58", "with the wheels forward right right I", "90:01", "mean it may lift it land on the wheels", "90:03", "but at some point when it wants to leave", "90:05", "the flips up points the wheels where it", "90:07", "wants to go and takes off and the gimbal", "90:09", "video you can see the craft do the roll", "90:12", "maneuver and it's really interesting it", "90:15", "behaves exactly like the craft that I", "90:17", "worked on so much like we have different", "90:20", "shaped aircrafts and fighter jets and", "90:23", "cars they probably have different shapes", "90:25", "of these objects that operate under", "90:28", "similar principles right but they all", "90:31", "have the same power source all the same", "90:34", "power source and we're also dealing with", "90:35", "if you think about the laws of", "90:40", "technological progression you know you", "90:42", "think of Moore's law and you think of", "90:44", "how things accelerate you've got to", "90:46", "think that if this civilization is who", "90:49", "knows how many years more advanced than", "90:51", "we are if not even years I mean I mean", "90:54", "we're thinking about in terms of", "90:55", "conventional terms right the way the way", "90:57", "we look at the world I mean they may be", "90:59", "they might be just superior in terms of", "91:02", "their intellect they've gotta be maybe", "91:04", "maybe we don't know well the only reason", "91:07", "I I say that is because look everyone", "91:12", "doesn't necessarily start at", "91:14", "steam engine right and go to an internal", "91:16", "combustion engine and then you know", "91:18", "electric power nuclear power and go up", "91:20", "the ladder that we right can't weigh on", "91:22", "you know the binary if the stuff is true", "91:24", "about the origin and the binary star", "91:26", "system and they have heavier elements", "91:28", "that we don't have and this element", "91:30", "stable element 115 is a naturally", "91:33", "occurring material maybe that's the", "91:35", "first thing they started experimenting", "91:37", "with and the version of their steam", "91:39", "engine their first product was something", "91:41", "that operated like this and actually", "91:43", "when they came to earth to look around", "91:45", "or you know whatever they were amazed at", "91:48", "the stuff we were doing these guys", "91:49", "burned stuff and squirted out the back", "91:51", "to go forward so right um right you know", "91:54", "who says they follow any kind of normal", "91:56", "progression like that", "91:57", "my thought was if you went back to the", "92:00", "1400s and then you went from 1400 to", "92:03", "1500 you're not gonna see that much of a", "92:05", "difference technologically right if you", "92:07", "go from 2,000 to 3,000 I assume there's", "92:11", "going to be a radical change right well", "92:13", "they yeah the Delta the rate of change", "92:15", "is is magnificently higher than it used", "92:19", "to be right so if you think about what", "92:22", "they had in 1988 and you think about", "92:25", "what they probably have in 2019 just", "92:29", "logically seems like they would advance", "92:32", "I would think so the only question is", "92:35", "like are they living is that a living", "92:39", "thing in terms of like a biological", "92:41", "thing or are they some sort of an", "92:44", "artificially created creation like we", "92:47", "are working on right now I

right yeah this is what happened", "108:27", "here's the thing you know I went to see", "108:29", "Brian Cox's he has this amazing live", "108:33", "show with Robin ence where they have", "108:36", "these LED screens he's huge screens with", "108:40", "high resolution depictions of the cosmos", "108:42", "and one of the most mind-blowing things", "108:44", "was he has this large-scale image of the", "108:48", "universe and it shows all the individual", "108:51", "galaxies of the universe and it just", "108:52", "keeps moving through all these galaxies", "108:55", "in three dimensions", "108:56", "and it's fucking incredible but what's", "108:58", "stunning is the relative uniformity of", "109:01", "it even at you know I mean you're", "109:03", "obviously looking at an incredibly small", "109:07", "depiction of something that's immensely", "109:08", "large like a galaxy of hundreds of", "109:11", "billions of stars you're seeing it as", "109:12", "this little dot but this little dot", "109:14", "that's flying through space surrounded", "109:17", "by other little darts with very", "109:19", "similarly spaced distances yeah Himanshu", "109:22", "yeah so Mike if we see uniformity in", "109:25", "that form in terms of like the distance", "109:28", "between cows like so many galaxies is so", "109:30", "it's so similar they might vary slightly", "109:32", "and that slightly might be hundreds of", "109:34", "millions of light years right but but", "109:36", "but there's so much uniformity why would", "109:38", "we not assume that that uniformity", "109:41", "exists pretty much everywhere and that", "109:43", "all these things that you're seeing that", "109:44", "are so similar you do see binary star", "109:47", "systems you do see single star systems", "109:49", "like sorry but there's also some some", "109:50", "speculation that earth and that our", "109:52", "solar system was one time was a binary", "109:54", "star system right I mean that's one of", "109:56", "the the speculations about that that", "109:58", "object that they find outside the Kuiper", "110:00", "belt that the thing is ten times larger", "110:01", "than Earth they think it might have been", "110:03", "at one point in time a star but this", "110:05", "this uniformity that you see why", "110:07", "wouldn't we think that that that has", "110:09", "it's same implications biologically that", "110:12", "there's some sort of a biological", "110:14", "uniformity and that this happens given", "110:17", "the right sets of circumstances yeah you", "110:18", "should be you should tell them some of", "110:20", "the stuff that you've read that you", "110:22", "don't know is true I mean if the the", "110:24", "stuff was true about the propulsion", "110:26", "stuff I mean anyway he well what have", "110:28", "you read what what you saw", "110:30", "- um you know what are you talking about", "110:33", "spill the beans Bob I got to poke the", "110:36", "bear here get some more liquor in yeah", "110:39", "the well I mean the again the the only", "110:45", "thing I could verify was what I had my", "110:48", "hands on they were you know there was", "110:51", "talk of weapon systems that there were", "110:54", "different projects project Galileo", "110:56", "project sidekick was supposed to be", "110:58", "weapon applications of the craft project", "111:01", "Looking Glass had to do with time any", "111:03", "effects of time in the craft now I don't", "111:05", "think we're not talking about making a", "111:08", "time machine like in science", "111:10",

"111:21", "weapon Pro how are you informed in this", "111:23", "phase again where there's just the small", "111:25", "briefings that I read but again I don't", "111:28", "really like to talk about those because", "111:30", "I don't have any information on him and", "111:31", "it was just you know small briefings he", "111:34", "told commander flavor that what he saw", "111:36", "might have been a time dilation and not", "111:39", "because gravity affects time you know", "111:42", "space time I'm sure you've heard of that", "111:44", "and you know what", "111:47", "what commander Faber saw as he was in", "111:49", "the f-18 approaching it he said it he", "111:53", "described it as a ping-pong ball in a", "111:55", "cup and shaking it back and forth it was", "111:57", "moving that fast now obviously if", "111:59", "there's anything inside there it's gonna", "112:02", "be battered to hell but you know my", "112:04", "point was was that well one of two", "112:07", "things either there's a gravitational", "112:10", "envelope in there which negates any", "112:12", "inertia effects or you are seeing", "112:16", "through a gravity distortion field so", "112:19", "you know just like you're looking at a a", "112:21", "hot Highway and you see you know an", "112:25", "optical distortion going through there", "112:27", "well the same thing happens in gravity", "112:29", "and the craft may not actually be moving", "112:31", "like that it may just look like it", "112:32", "because you're seeing you can only see", "112:35", "it through the field so it may be making", "112:38", "much more gentle moves I'm not saying", "112:40", "that's it but it has to be one of the", "112:43", "two and the thing shows up 60 miles away", "112:46", "they noticed it on radar 60 seconds", "112:49", "after left commander flavor but it was", "112:52", "at his cap point which is the next point", "112:54", "he was destined to go 260 miles away and", "112:57", "in 60 seconds on radar the same object", "113:01", "ends up there so it's going a mile a", "113:04", "second no they I think the radar just", "113:07", "picked it up in 60 seconds yeah it could", "113:10", "have been there instantly but yeah we", "113:11", "don't know the psychics time nobody", "113:13", "knows that's whole thing also its cycles", "113:16", "like radar cycles min doesn't sweep a", "113:21", "planar array so it just you know", "113:24", "scans around it it random place the", "113:26", "spy-1 does the really cool present do", "113:28", "the whole loop anymore right the point", "113:30", "uh the point is though that the craft", "113:32", "moved to his next location before he", "113:36", "knew where his next location was going", "113:38", "to be Jesus and that I mean that's well", "113:43", "documented so that that's a pretty", "113:46", "shocking piece of information what's", "113:49", "fascinating to me too is that you were", "113:50", "discussing this the the way this reactor", "113:54", "worked and that these things were not", "113:56", "really connected no nothing is connected", "113:59", "there's no wiring at all that freaks me", "114:05", "the fuck out charge your iPhone you know", "114:07", "yeah", "114:08", "yeah yeah I mean that's the that's yeah", "114:13", "I know again but that's just simple", "114:15", "electromagnetic induction revenue Tesla", "114:18", "the scientist had this concept of right", "114:20", "yeah yeah that's what I'm talking mean", "114:22", "Franklin on the worse and he wanted to", "114:24", "send wireless electricity through the", "114:27", "sky and Westinghouse was like get the", "114:28", "fuck out of here with that like when", "114:30", "anybody could just pull electricity yeah", "114:32", "this cab meter yeah they couldn't we", "114:34", "just talk in the car right over trying", "114:36", "to chill them out you know we're talking", "114:37", "about Tesla you know you couldn't be", "114:39", "meter didn't how it all that down so", "114:41", "that's funny bring it up yeah that don't", "114:43", "mean who knows what would have happened", "114:45", "in terms of innovation", "114:47", "had he been allowed to go forward with", "114:48", "that well we probably wouldn't have", "114:51", "computers you think yeah I'm pretty", "114:54", "positive well I mean forget about micro", "114:56", "electronics well this is dumping huge", "114:58", "amounts of electromagnetic energy in the", "115:00", "air and yeah we'd be able to wirelessly", "115:02", "turn on our lights but there'd be no", "115:06", "radio communication the interference", "115:08", "would be something we could would be", "115:09", "overwhelming it would induce electric", "115:12", "currents and anything with a small wire", "115:14", "on it so integrated circuits transistors", "115:16", "would be disintegrated before they were", "115:18", "even you know tested for operation so it", "115:21", "would it ways elect us up yeah it would", "115:25", "have stopped us dead we'd have it'd be", "115:27", "great you can turn lighters on and", "115:28", "heaters from all over the place with no", "115:30", "wires but it would stop modern", "115:32", "electronics and this we became dependent", "115:34", "on it", "115:34", "it would almost be like our dependence", "115:36", "on fossil fuels although its destructive", "115:38", "it's very difficult for us to get off", "115:40", "the nipple it would have changed the", "115:42", "course of how he developed which is so", "115:44", "interesting when you talk about it a", "115:45", "civilization of the star system didn't", "115:47", "even start with fossil fuels they had", "115:49", "115 naturally on their planet and", "115:51", "they're like cool anti-gravity is pretty", "115:52", "awesome", "115:53", "well the fact that they I think it's", "115:54", "important that that actually happened", "115:56", "yeah it might have been stopped in its", "115:59", "tracks for a reason whoa and it's just", "116:04", "it's I think it's incredibly difficult", "116:06", "for us to imagine technological", "116:09", "progression under another timeline other", "116:10", "than one that we've experienced yeah", "116:12", "that's difficult if we imagine what this", "116:16", "alien race must have been like and uh I", "116:19", "mean God just just to be able to see", "116:22", "something to like I mean obviously we've", "116:24", "seen it in different life forms right", "116:26", "like we see the life of certain beetles", "116:28", "in comparison to the life of certain", "116:30", "fish very very different existence very", "116:32", "different life cycles octopus yeah", "116:35", "octopus I mean we see all these", "116:37", "different variables in terms of", "116:38", "biological entities on earth but we", "116:41", "don't see it in terms of technological", "116:42", "innovation as we're the only one that's", "116:45", "intelligent that can innovate we we have", "116:47", "intelligent creatures but they're in the", "116:49", "ocean the only other thing that are like", "116:50", "us are dolphins and orcas and whales and", "116:52", "they don't have the ability to", "116:54", "manipulate their environment and", "116:55", "subsequently because they don't have the", "116:57", "ability to emit and manipulate their", "116:58", "environment we put them in fish tanks", "117:00", "and we're like get in the tank do some", "117:02", "tricks right you know the only thing he", "117:04", "saw in the craft if we were considering", "117:07", "Bob's story the only thing that you he", "117:09", "saw in the craft that he related to it", "117:11", "looked like a human could make was this", "117:13", "honeycomb hatch and I always loved that", "117:15", "because you're like obsessed with this", "117:17", "thing that you could recognize a focus", "117:21", "on that because it was the one thing", "117:22", "that I understood how it worked what was", "117:25", "it and it was it was the access to the", "117:27", "level below and it was well you know if", "117:32", "you take yep a six-pack of beer and you", "117:35", "take out the cardboard dividers mm-hmm", "117:37", "set it on the table you can put a lot of", "117:40", "pressure on the top but if you push it", "117:43", "from the sides it collapses flat mmm so", "117:45", "it was something like that in a", "117:47", "honeycomb shape", "117:48", "that was essentially some sort of sheet", "117:50", "metal and you could walk on that an", "117:53", "upper layer but if you took the corner", "117:55", "stuck your finger in and pushed it", "117:57", "collapsed and made a an entryway hmm so", "118:01", "I thought that was a really unique I had", "118:03", "never seen that before and it was the", "118:05", "only thing in the crap that made", "118:06", "absolute sense to me as it ah we can", "118:08", "make that and all that is as a hatchway", "118:10", "was there any discussion about the", "118:13", "materials that were used to make the", "118:15", "craft I'm sure there was but that was a", "118:17", "metallurgy division had nothing to do", "118:19", "with us she never got a not even the", "118:22", "slightest briefing I don't even know if", "118:24", "it was metal or it was ceramic it's I", "118:26", "think it there's a fine line between the", "118:29", "two now one of the things that's", "118:31", "happened to you that has allowed people", "118:34", "to discredit you was there's obviously", "118:37", "been some sort of an effort to erase", "118:39", "your past yeah some sort of an effort to", "118:43", "erase your education history your", "118:46", "employment history at los alamos in fact", "118:48", "the only way your employment history was", "118:50", "proven at los alamos if someone got a", "118:52", "list a directory of the employees from", "118:54", "the past and read into it and you were", "118:57", "on that list so it proved that you", "118:58", "worked there even though people were", "118:59", "trying to deny and they were trying to", "119:00", "use that as a way to discredit you never", "119:02", "did work at los alamos you weren't real", "119:04", "scientists what was what was that like", "119:07", "to experience I mean of course we're", "119:09", "talking about the 1980's the 1990s when", "119:12", "you could get away with something like", "119:13", "that yeah I always say there are a lot", "119:16", "less a lot less records on computers at", "119:20", "that time it was still file cabinets and", "119:22", "folders but yeah that was frightening", "119:25", "that was one of the first things I think", "119:29", "it's I think George Knapp was the first", "119:31", "one that uncovered that I mean he saw my", "119:33", "birth certificate disappear he", "119:35", "disappeared", "119:37", "yeah there was no record of you being", "119:38", "there was there was no record of that", "119:40", "there was money his mom tells me about", "119:43", "that like it was frightening for her for", "119:45", "he's got a real family you know he's", "119:47", "real person is frightening for her but", "119:50", "if the Los Alamos thing really surprised", "119:52", "me and that there was so adamant that", "119:54", "now this guy never worked here don't be", "119:56", "ridiculous and George went back and", "119:58", "forth you know for I got the letters on", "120:00", "the world yeah", "120:01", "once I mean it was ridiculous but", "120:03", "fortunately somebody came up with a 1982", "120:06", "phone book directory I mean and also", "120:09", "originally I told you you know when I", "120:13", "worked there I was on the front page of", "120:15", "the paper so they were still able to", "120:17", "archive you know break bring that back", "120:19", "from the archives and you know Bob Lazar", "120:21", "a physicist working here at Los Alamos", "120:23", "oh there was at least something there", "120:25", "but somehow George came up with the", "120:28", "phone directory and then George then Bob", "120:30", "took George with cameras into Los Alamos", "120:33", "oh yeah yeah so we flew out there and I", "120:35", "said look come on in I'll show you where", "120:38", "I worked we'll go in well meet people", "120:40", "and George went with me and you know no", "120:42", "gate the place oh yeah you know met", "120:45", "people and you know and Los Alamos was", "120:47", "also the place where they had the", "120:50", "machine that was able to read the the", "120:53", "size of your digits no no that was", "120:55", "awesome that was s4 that was s4 and", "120:57", "explain that so now this was back in the", "121:01", "80s and this is back in the 80s where", "121:03", "when you discuss this people like this", "121:05", "doesn't even exist yeah okay what was it", "121:08", "it was a way you know this is before", "121:10", "fingerprint scanners and you know and", "121:13", "anything of anything a high-resolution", "121:16", "scanner at that time so what it was was", "121:19", "a device that had a little picture of a", "121:21", "hand on a glass plate with pins in it so", "121:24", "you could Jam your hand in there and", "121:26", "there was a bright light above it and a", "121:28", "sensor underneath and when you put your", "121:31", "hand in there the light would turn on", "121:32", "and it would measure the bones in your", "121:34", "finger because the light shone through", "121:37", "your bones and apparently the length of", "121:42", "the bones and your fingers are extremely", "121:44", "unique and easy to measure and they use", "121:46", "that when you put your hands on there", "121:48", "the light would turn on and your badge", "121:50", "would pop out there's it oh there it is", "121:52", "that's that's it and I tried to describe", "121:54", "this to people and they said that is the", "121:57", "most ridiculous thing we've ever heard", "121:58", "and I said hey that my badge came out of", "122:03", "that thing I put my hand on it badge", "122:05", "popped out and that's how I could open", "122:06", "the doors and get into s4 and you know", "122:10", "and everybody discredited that they said", "122:11", "it was bullshit it was thought of", "122:12", "science fiction and Jeremy you found", "122:14", "that", "122:15", "I found it through a good friend of mine", "122:17", "named Tyler rogue away and he had some", "122:19", "good sources inside of area 52 where", "122:21", "they also used these for the stealth", "122:24", "program right around that time so now", "122:26", "I've got all these people that worked", "122:27", "within who you know said only if you're", "122:30", "in certain programs would we use this", "122:32", "technology it's kind of shit actually", "122:33", "they didn't keep it for very long", "122:34", "beginning of biometrics so I was able to", "122:36", "reveal it in my film I kept my mouth", "122:38", "shut until I showed it to Bob you know", "122:41", "the movie is the first time he saw it", "122:43", "was how you see in the documentary", "122:44", "that's his genuine reaction getting", "122:46", "goosebumps that was a great idea the way", "122:47", "you did it thank you man because you", "122:49", "know what guess what I'm actually trying", "122:50", "to see if he's telling the truth that's", "122:52", "how I started you know that I started so", "122:54", "it was really cool to see that that you", "122:55", "get to see it his no actual reaction has", "122:58", "that been verified by other people yeah", "123:00", "so yes so to me it has personally I get", "123:04", "emails every day and people are telling", "123:06", "me where these are used and how they're", "123:08", "used and the send me photos I got a lot", "123:09", "of photos by Danny Matteson and how they", "123:11", "were used right they're not how they", "123:12", "were you invite using yeah but I don't", "123:14", "the most recent one was way more recent", "123:17", "than I thought in another country but", "123:18", "yeah that technology was used so what's", "123:21", "so funny is that this technology even in", "123:27", "the area of 52 where they'd use them for", "123:28", "Tonopah one of the guys who will go on", "123:30", "camera when he will do an interview with", "123:33", "me he was a technician for one of these", "123:35", "and and he hated them cuz they were", "123:37", "really bad they always broke down and", "123:39", "never and he was a technician for him", "123:41", "and he won't tell me where if he worked", "123:43", "at area 52 so is probably Tonopah it's", "123:46", "very separated even on base but yeah so", "123:48", "there was that yeah there is your", "123:52", "education record that was also like what", "123:55", "happened with that that well that", "123:58", "disappeared also you know that I I have", "124:00", "I've never gone I've never gone anywhere", "124:03", "for education I've never gone I never", "124:07", "attended any classes at Cal Tech I never", "124:09", "attended anything at MIT you did attend", "124:12", "classes in those places I did attend", "124:14", "classes in those places do you know", "124:16", "anybody that you went to school with yes", "124:18", "I do and have they verified that they", "124:20", "went to school with you well I give", "124:21", "Jeremy some names but people yeah I the", "124:24", "reason I don't say these names publicly", "124:27", "is", "124:27", "every single time I mentioned a name", "124:30", "somebody gets and you don't want to be", "124:33", "yours yeah yeah of course but what what", "124:37", "is that experience like seeing your", "124:39", "birth certificate erased seeing your", "124:42", "employment is frightening it's
