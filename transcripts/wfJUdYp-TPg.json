"39:44", "we said that on a Dick Cavett show", "39:46", "yeah later and I think Matt Taibbi on", "39:48", "this show talked about it well where one", "39:50", "thing is that muskie was already out of", "39:52", "the campaign when that came out", "39:54", "must get already lost and so muskie had", "39:56", "been a fucking monster and a terrible", "39:59", "person on that campaign and so Thompson", "40:01", "used that version of muskie and wrote as", "40:04", "Taibbi said in a very straight way that", "40:06", "it became story and so if you had a", "40:08", "sense irony you kind of

even more you know", "40:18", "what I think he dramatized the way other", "40:20", "people didn't he would say I look left I", "40:22", "look up I see he came down to me and", "40:24", "then he said people didn't write like", "40:26", "that in journalism they didn't go step", "40:28", "by step and he did and that was really", "40:30", "important what I think is more important", "40:31", "than the Iligan story", "40:32", "so the emmagan story in the background", "40:34", "is Ed muskie was the frontrunner for the", "40:35", "Democratic primary in 1972 he fucked up", "40:39", "his campaign

was", "81:23", "really upset so why did she say that", "81:25", "that doesn't make any sense because I", "81:27", "think she thought that I was making the", "81:30", "experience less authentic by trying to", "81:32", "qualify it for our current times but why", "81:35", "would that be the case when you were", "81:36", "just explained explain oh I should have", "81:38", "just allowed Thompson helmet no but I", "81:41", "think I should have let him stand more", "81:43", "instead of showing or amplifying his", "81:46", "emotion too much but he's saying the", "81:48", "based on her criticism not personal", "81:51", "opinion no I think that he was really", "81:53", "upset but I think him being really upset", "81:54", "is secondary to whatever she was", "81:57", "experiencing right but you're writing", "81:58", "about him yes so I stand by it", "82:00", "like I thought about that what I wrote", "82:02", "it yeah I stand by it but what was what", "82:04", "is her criticism again that by", "82:05", "amplifying his upsetness by showing how", "82:08", "upset he was that that's too much of an", "82:10", "excuse for him just just write it where", "82:12", "he was think he should have done stepped", "82:15", "in no no no no nothing like that she was", "82:17", "on point she thought I shouldn't she", "82:19", "felt the effort on my part to try to", "82:21", "explain his upsetness instead of just", "82:23", "having him be upset with one sentence", "82:25", "and then go on she thought it was over", "82:27", "writing I thought it was a fair", "82:28", "criticism where I over wrote it but long", "82:31", "story short Thompson goes back and he", "82:34", "goes like he's eating goes this is one", "82:35", "of the worst things I've ever seen this", "82:36", "is in the documentary right that's the", "82:38", "case then why would why would it be that", "82:40", "you were overriding it that doesn't seem", "82:42", "like you overrode it I always worry I'm", "82:43", "over writing this one it might create", "82:45", "it's one of my great fears is that if", "82:47", "someone sees something like that I think", "82:49", "it's important that you accurately relay", "82:51", "the emotions that they experience when", "82:53", "they're watching a horrific event I mean", "82:55", "he did to survive it as horrific but how", "82:56", "much of it is my cultural perception of", "82:59", "this moment that I'm giving too much to", "83:01", "Thompson and how much of it was what he", "83:02", "accurately experienced but he's talked", "83:04", "about so I think just giving his words", "83:06", "instead of a saying a little bit you", "83:08", "know going okay I don't know what he", "83:09", "said yeah yeah and so but he goes back", "83:12", "in heat on his notes that night these", "83:13", "are the notes he gave to Ken Kesey I'm", "83:15", "sorry these are the notes to him to Tom", "83:16", "Wolfe he says he's gave him the", "83:18", "recordings no I

there were the notes of it so", "83:28", "I'm gonna be the notes of what happened", "83:30", "and Tom Wolfe I know what those notes", "83:32", "are used those notes okay to recreate", "83:34", "that scene in electric kool-aid acid", "83:36", "test mmm and so this is why we talk", "83:39", "about truth later in life Thompson some", "83:41", "biographies might have said that he", "83:42", "actually recorded the event he didn't he", "83:44", "went back and he took these long audio", "83:46", "notes right of like shadow and light and", "83:48", "the whore that he saw that's what I'm", "83:50",

"83:58", "that he put the tape recorder in them no", "83:59", "no that's not that's not what I meant I", "84:01", "mean", "84:01", "he gave him the recordings and I was", "84:03", "like they're terrifying but it's about", "84:06", "like violence and shadow and light and", "84:08", "horror you know it's a horrific it's a", "84:11", "horrific scene that says Thompson's", "84:13", "brilliance at that age he could in an", "84:15", "audio note get the fucking images and", "84:18", "details that he needs to express the the", "84:20", "nature of that instant and so Tom Wolfe", "84:22", "used those to create it himself but then", "84:25", "Thompson recreated it to wrote about it", "84:27", "in house angels yeah but in a more", "84:30", "distant way than Wolfe did which is", "84:32", "crazy because he was actually there it's", "84:34", "fucking crazy dude now is the first time", "84:35", "Thompson ever took acid because he was", "84:37", "so upset he went to Kesey he's like fuck", "84:38", "it I'm not a journalist anymore", "84:40", "that's so horrific what I saw fuck it I", "84:42", "he had friends that had told him that", "84:44", "he's a personality where if he did acid", "84:46", "to go to the bottom of the well for him", "84:47", "you know this would be a really horrific", "84:49", "thing and so he's like I don't care", "84:51", "anymore and instead he just walked",
