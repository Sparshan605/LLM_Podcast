rounds", "57:24", "and now they're weird right yeah you get", "57:25", "into it you look out fuck the belt you", "57:27", "know what's interesting about that it's", "57:28", "easier to go five minutes boxing then it", "57:32", "is to go three minutes of wrestling", "57:34", "yes UFC is like five minute rounds and", "57:38", "boxing is three minute rounds they just", "57:40", "got used to it but one thing though is", "57:42", "if you give shorter route there is a", "57:44", "good argument for a shorter round that", "57:46", "argument is guys can go faster and", "57:48", "harder in three minutes", "57:51", "than they can in five because they have", "57:52", "to conserve themselves right do you feel", "57:54", "like boxing over the last year making a", "57:57", "comeback or not for sure okay I think", "58:00", "boxing isn't a good place right it's", "58:01", "making a little comeback yeah and it", "58:03", "might have something to do with the fact", "58:05", "that there's a rivalry going on between", "58:06", "UFC and boxing like what sport is better", "58:08", "yeah I think it's bringing more", "58:10", "attention to boxing you know by the UFC", "58:12", "fans they're paying attention to boxing", "58:14", "because there's this debate that's good", "58:17", "good argument maybe the UFC boxing up", "58:20", "well it's also boxing's in a real good", "58:22", "place right now there's so many good", "58:23", "fighters chenko I mean these two", "58:27", "gentlemen or do you really do a three", "58:29", "minute round UFC I mean with jiu-jitsu", "58:31", "and all that just so you couldn't work", "58:32", "what I would think is maybe a five", "58:34", "minute round a box and be kind of", "58:35", "interesting but I think they're doing it", "58:36", "right honestly because I think you know", "58:39", "you could go hard and fast for three", "58:40", "minutes and maybe it'll ensure a faster", "58:42", "pace for the majority of the fight then", "58:44", "if you made guys fight five-minute", "58:46", "rounds how often do they give out ten", "58:47", "eight rounds in boxing quite when guys", "58:49", "get dropped quite a bit it's pretty", "58:53", "common", "58:53", "it was uncommon for a long time in MMA", "58:55", "but it's more common now while it was", "58:57", "good head movement there by Canelo I", "58:58", "feel that a rule changes right", "59:00", "yeah can L

get to this level so", "59:17", "this what's exciting about this fight is", "59:20", "that to get to this level there's so", "59:22", "much shit you got to go through it's so", "59:24", "rare that a guy comes out this good you", "59:27", "know but there's so few of them at even", "59:31", "rare they get two of them", "59:32", "finally fighting yeah like this who else", "59:34", "from the top

they rematch I think they", "72:50", "rematch they should why not", "72:53", "I think Connor would have to beat", "72:55", "somebody good in a boxing match and he", "72:59", "would also have to have a real training", "73:01", "camp I think I think boxing is over for", "73:04", "Conor oh I don't think so", "73:05", "one more fight like that because people", "73:07", "will buy it now Fenton I went to

ever", "73:16", "there's so many you're right you're", "73:20", "right you're right there's that too but", "73:22", "the thing is if there's a legit big", "73:25", "fight like say if Canelo Alvarez steps", "73:27", "up and says that he wants to fight Conor", "73:30", "McGregor", "73:30", "[Laughter]", "73:37", "I think Conor made me realize you got it", "73:40", "specialized well absolutely you can't do", "73:42", "both", "73:43", "especially the difference between Canelo", "73:45", "and Floyd the Floyd was just a brilliant", "73:47", "boxer Canelo's a murderous puncher and", "73:49", "he'll fuck you up", "73:51", "he'll hurt you there's also a", "73:53", "promotional difference to Conor and", "73:55", "Floyd are pretty much they're very", "73:56", "similar guys and they both understood", "73:59", "what they were doing promotion wise I", "74:00", "don't know if Canelo is that guy well", "74:02", "he's not gonna promote it that way but", "74:04", "he's got the whole loo that uppercut", "74:05", "that's his genius it's he's got the", "74:09", "support of the American people it's love", "74:11", "Ginn vs McGregor oh look at that", "74:16", "uppercut you would die I'm I don't know", "74:18", "if I Gregor take that fight no that's", "74:20", "not a good fight for him either", "74:22", "neither Canelo or golovkin is a good", "74:24", "fight for em it's a terrible fight for", "74:26", "him those guys are different they're", "74:28", "they're they're this you know I click it", "74:30", "with the way these guys fight especially", "74:32", "with this is how golovkin fights every", "74:34", "fight I bring big drama show", "74:38", "that's what he calls it dude I mean this", "74:47", "is one of those fights we're gonna be", "74:48", "looking back on someday look at those", "74:49", "shuttle buses Nellie this is one of", "74:53", "those fights that we're gonna look back", "74:54", "on and go you remember when we watch", "74:56", "that fucking fight holy shit look at he", "74:59", "just shook his head on him", "75:00", "golovkin is putting tremendous pressure", "75:02", "on him he's trying to break him", "75:06", "yeah he's keeping him against the ropes", "75:07", "for 80% of the fight it's not just that", "75:09", "like it's the pace that he's fighting at", "75:11", "he's trying to make him wither he sees", "75:14", "something you think he's he's invading", "75:16", "yeah he sees him trying to catch some", "75:18", "breaks he's still super dangerous but", "75:20", "golovkin catches he's seeing Canelo", "75:23", "trying to catch his breath and that's he", "75:25", "displayed it on the seat in between", "75:27", "rounds his feet we're all out yeah see", "75:29", "if I if I know this and I don't know", "75:31", "that much about boxing I know that", "75:33", "Canelo has what people think of as an", "75:35", "endurance problem and it's not you know", "75:38", "it's not a big mystery", "75:40", "he just kind of fades a little bit who", "75:42", "we just got tagged he just got tagged", "75:44", "he might get my god ooh", "75:48", "it's not that he doesn't work hard it's", "75:50", "just like his style is just so explosive", "75:52", "and he's got so much muscle that he", "75:54", "carries around that style requires you", "75:57", "to be in fucking sensational shape well", "75:59", "it does it does it mean anything that", "76:00", "he's a counter puncher cuz they're", "76:01", "always getting hit first so you got to", "76:03", "take a little bit more to know not", "76:04", "necessarily his defense is outstanding", "76:06", "look at that look how good he ducked", "76:08", "under that right hand his defense is", "76:09", "amazing it's just like he's never been", "76:11", "hit like this before and not with a guy", "76:13", "like golovkin he's just putting it to", "76:15", "him he's been hit by a guy like Floyd", "76:17", "who just caught him with good clean", "76:19", "scoring shots snapped his head back a", "76:22", "couple of times but nothing like like a", "76:25", "mule kicking in the face this is a", "76:27", "different thing because golovkin is", "76:28", "trying to break him he's not just trying", "76:30", "to win he's putting himself in danger", "76:32", "he's putting himself in danger to prove", "76:34", "that he's the best and that's a", "76:36", "different thing that's a different kind", "76:38", "of person with he's not making the kind", "76:40", "of money that these guys are making he's", "76:42", "hungry as fuck see that uppercut yeah Oh", "76:44", "baby and again he's not making the kind", "76:47", "of like superstar money that he just saw", "76:49", "Connor and Fleur", "76:50", "and the only way that he can make it is", "76:52", "to being big drama show and so he's just", "76:56", "coming for deaf once again for this fire", "76:58", "who knows yeah I think it's probably", "77:00", "depending upon the pay-per-view sales", "77:01", "yeah I literally have no scale for what",
