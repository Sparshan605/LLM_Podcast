"135:41", "year", "135:42", "and then he's back and killing it", "135:43", "because he's so good at comedy because", "135:45", "like with tiger woods right", "135:46", "people hated tiger well there was that", "135:48", "but there was also the material that", "135:50", "got leaked when he came back so people", "135:52", "were upset at the jokes the parkland", "135:53", "joke", "135:54", "yeah not the best it's that shit falls", "135:57", "in line with how he's always done jokes", "135:59", "though", "136:00", "whether he did this or not he says the", "136:02", "fucked up thing to say",

person like", "136:53", "a year that ain't shit dude", "136:55", "but as a comic not to be able to do well", "136:57", "let's let's", "136:58", "imagine that he's going to live another", "137:00", "50 years", "137:02", "right a year a year out of 50.", "137:06", "it's like 2 percent right yeah it's a", "137:08", "lot it's a lot", "137:10", "and a lot of money yeah but now now", "137:13", "compare

"137:27", "is that fair that's a good question", "137:32", "i mean uh the real question is would he", "137:35", "have even been able to pursue that", "137:38", "weight class", "137:40", "like with what you were saying in terms", "137:42", "of like having the uh", "137:44", "advantage of the epo yeah i wonder if he", "137:46", "would have been able to pursue training", "137:48", "but in the same way in hindsight what a", "137:50", "terrible idea", "137:53", "you know i don't know what the thought", "137:55", "process was but it's definitely", "137:57", "definitely not good and um it it doesn't", "138:00", "take away from how talented and skillful", "138:02", "he is as a fighter", "138:04", "and if that's the only time he did it", "138:05", "it's kind of understandable that's what", "138:07", "i'm giving him", "138:08", "yeah if that's the only time but i think", "138:11", "honestly all bullshit decide i think you", "138:13", "are right as far as don't test anybody", "138:15", "else", "138:15", "don't don't go back and test everybody", "138:17", "no", "138:18", "unless you want to spend a lot of money", "138:21", "then one of the things they were saying", "138:22", "that like", "138:22", "to test everyone for epo would cost an", "138:24", "additional two and a half million", "138:26", "dollars a year", "138:27", "something ridiculous like that i might", "138:28", "have made this number stop doing that", "138:30", "divide that money amongst the fighters", "138:33", "how often do you test don't care give", "138:35", "the footage more", "138:37", "like what styleman and kelvin did in max", "138:39", "hallway and dustin poury they should be", "138:42", "set for quite some time but here's the", "138:45", "thing", "138:45", "if we look over the history and really", "138:47", "our only", "138:48", "testing pool would be conor mcgregor who", "138:50", "never has to fight again", "138:52", "nate diaz i guess you could throw into", "138:53", "that who they make life changing money", "138:55", "right they don't fight a lot do they no", "138:57", "and here here's the question", "138:58", "because if you give i'm sorry i don't", "139:00", "mean all right but let's say", "139:01", "you know if you give certain fighters 20", "139:04", "million dollars", "139:04", "like you want me to do what now and they", "139:07", "don't fight", "139:08", "right so if

"139:27", "fucked up so if i'm not saying it's the", "139:28", "right thing to do", "139:29", "but i'm saying if you're dan from his", "139:31", "standpoint you're like when they get", "139:32", "back", "139:34", "they really think that way i don't think", "139:36", "that's the case", "139:37", "i think it's a side effect of making", "139:38", "boatloads of money but i think they try", "139:39", "to make boatloads of money because it", "139:41", "doesn't happen very often", "139:42", "it only happens with a ronda rousey or", "139:44", "conor mcgregor or some", "139:45", "gigantic huge star like a nate diaz you", "139:48", "have to be a gigantic", "139:50", "yeah but that's that's rare there's so", "139:52", "few of those guys", "139:53", "there's so few of those the idea that", "139:55", "you would try to pay", "139:56", "people less because you want to keep", "139:58", "them hungry because", "139:59", "if they become giant superstars and", "140:02", "they're not
