place", "50:40", "that always been like really close to my", "50:41", "heart like I grew up", "50:43", "when I was kid you know it's a place", "50:47", "that has been I think like deeply", "50:48", "misrepresented again another place has", "50:50", "been deeply misrepresented in the media", "50:53", "you know and but you know we got like I", "50:58", "got into town on the scout there and", "51:00", "it's like there's no restaurant you know", "51:02", "it's not just that there's no restaurant", "51:04", "like in the town there's like two", "51:05", "restaurants in the county you know and I", "51:07", "remember having this moment of like can", "51:09", "we do this was this work like well Tony", "51:12", "respond to this and we make a show here", "51:14", "and within two days he was like this big", "51:18", "you know very deeply heartfelt", "51:21", "statements about the place really loved", "51:23", "it you know and it was kind of another", "51:25", "aha oh yeah of course", "51:27", "because there's something everywhere the", "51:29", "human story is everywhere and you wanna", "51:31", "dig into it wherever you go the", "51:34", "fundamentals of that don't change and I", "51:36", "think that you know what he did was so", "51:40", "cleanly and clearly and so free of", "51:43", "bullshit cut to the core of those very", "51:47", "fundamental kind of human stories you", "51:50", "know and anyways it worked well we won", "51:54", "an Emmy tonight to go for it so yeah", "51:58", "posthumous Emmys are always odd right", "52:00", "yeah that was a rough night when he", "52:06", "would get the rough cut would it be", "52:09", "length of the actual show and then he", "52:11", "would add narration to it did he have", "52:13", "any say in the editing process huge I", "52:15", "mean so I think that's something", "52:17", "important to about who he was you know I", "52:20", "mean like everyone calls him a chef he", "52:23", "wasn't a chef like he was a producer", "52:24", "television producer you know he he would", "52:29", "pick the locations he'd picked the", "52:30", "subject matter for the most part you", "52:32", "know there were a couple like how did", "52:33", "you guys work it out like say if you", "52:34", "were gonna go to Puerto Rico", "52:36", "or something like that how would you", "52:38", "make make the decisions how would you", "52:39", "decide where to go and why okay well", "52:42", "I'll take you through the whole process", "52:43", "so so Tony would come up with a list of", "52:46", "places that he was interested in going", "52:47", "and maybe we would throw a couple in", "52:49", "like I'd mention the West Virginia show", "52:51", "you know be like but this is my list", "52:53", "right and and then he write like a brief", "52:56", "each one I'm interested in X you know", "52:59", "like I'm interested in Singapore it's", "53:02", "Disneyland with the death penalty right", "53:04", "and you're like okay so there's like", "53:06", "there's kind of a basic operating thesis", "53:09", "right we can kind of like go in and look", "53:11", "at this place", "53:13", "from this perspective and some of them", "53:17", "some of them didn't add the Lego SEPA", "53:19", "sewed for example you just be like like", "53:21", "we we haven't been in Nigeria let's go", "53:23", "to Nigeria", "53:23", "you know and and so we would start doing", "53:26", "research on what that was just big kind", "53:29", "of you know 30,000 foot macro you know", "53:33", "what is this environment like what are", "53:35", "the interesting things what are the", "53:37", "stories that have been told about this", "53:38", "place and how can we look at it from a", "53:40", "different angle", "53:41", "so like the Nigeria one we kind of", "53:43", "focused in on like I said you know", "53:45", "grassroots capitalism DIY", "53:48", "entrepreneurship you know street level", "53:52", "you know the street level kind of", "53:54", "dynamics of the economy you know and", "53:57", "that became like like we could see ways", "54:00", "to kind of make a beautiful like human", "54:03", "story out of those elements so I'd end", "54:07", "up putting down to him probably in like", "54:10", "a two or three page thing like here are", "54:12", "my ideas you know here's what I found", "54:15", "based on what you were interested in", "54:17", "here's some other things I found this is", "54:19", "the way we'd kind of like to go about it", "54:21", "and he'd either be like ya know you know", "54:23", "and from that point we just get heavy", "54:26", "into research right a treatment you know", "54:30", "and break that story into like six acts", "54:33", "right and then look for scenes to kind", "54:37", "of feel and articulate that story so it", "54:40", "scenes like you know I have this great", "54:43", "economist I know we're gonna need an", "54:44", "economist at some point but we got to", "54:47", "put you

the the whole ethos of the", "95:45", "show I know but he made fun of it on the", "95:48", "show listen honestly it's a great scene", "95:51", "it's great it's a great scene largely", "95:53", "because Sally Freeman that producer of", "95:56", "that is like absolutely brilliant and", "95:58", "one of the best directors has ever come", "96:00", "through that show so yeah it was funny", "96:03", "to take on realizing that they were", "96:06", "throwing frozen octopus into the water", "96:08", "yeah exactly like how mortified he was", "96:11", "by it all yeah totally but I mean I bet", "96:14", "that again like that's that's the way it", "96:17", "was you know like we didn't go in and", "96:19", "like be like okay action and now cut", "96:21", "okay and now we're gonna move the", "96:22", "cameras and say that again", "96:23", "you know there's none of that mana you I", "96:26", "mean part of the hustle of the show was", "96:28", "like being there with the cameras yeah", "96:29", "you set up the scene and then you press", "96:31", "play and you let it go and what happens", "96:33", "happens and I'm sorry if you don't get", "96:35", "exactly what you hoped out of it you", "96:38", "know but we're not going to interrupt", "96:39", "the world we're not going to manipulate", "96:40", "and control things that is the", "96:42", "difference between really good reality", "96:44", "TV the word reality TV is so weird", "96:47", "like what does that even mean because", "96:49", "a lot of these shows they're scripted", "96:52", "yeah they have these loose scenarios and", "96:55", "then they go in they script them and", "96:57", "they redo things that reshoot things", "96:59", "it's not reality it's like shitty acting", "97:01", "with people that are not trained and", "97:03", "they're edited with people talking from", "97:07", "the camera like I didn't know what Moe", "97:09", "was thinking crazy I told Joe what we're", "97:15", "gonna do like the Kardashians I mean", "97:21", "they've got it down to a fucking science", "97:23", "a science of moronic television viewing", "97:26", "I agree if you could just sit there", "97:28", "slack-jawed uh they'll keep you locked", "97:31", "in they'll keep you locked in don't", "97:32", "Eddie they're good out of edits they'll", "97:34", "show you their tits and right boom you", "97:35", "cut to commercial on their rear right", "97:38", "that's reality TV what what you guys are", "97:40", "doing is more documentary television yes", "97:43", "it is and it's not saying that it's not", "97:46", "saying that there's no effect of of the", "97:48", "convention of television there of course", "97:50", "there is but we used to say like you", "97:52", "know like Vietnam doesn't look like that", "97:55", "but Vietnam doesn't not look like that", "97:57", "you know there is a there is a", "97:59", "refinement in the manipulation in what", "98:02", "we're doing because we're choosing these", "98:03", "locations we're choosing to talk to this", "98:05", "person we're choosing to shoot it in a", "98:06", "certain way that's beautiful we're", "98:08", "adding light you know it's not exactly", "98:11", "the way reality is but there's a", "98:12", "threshold there's a line which you don't", "98:14", "cross and that line is is a morally and", "98:18", "ethically established line by Tony and", "98:20", "by the crew that says like there's", "98:23", "there's a place at which it becomes", "98:25", "unfair the manipulation of reality", "98:28", "becomes a manipulation that has now", "98:31", "become unfair to the people who are", "98:33", "viewing this the people who are there", "98:35", "you know we're we're we've become", "98:37", "self-serving you know and that's the", "98:40", "line that we chose never to cross you", "98:41", "know we can make it beautiful we can", "98:44", "refine it down you know we can edit it", "98:46", "we can make a compelling show but it has", "98:50", "to it has to exist within under this", "98:53", "within this certain threshold or else", "98:55", "what you know what the fuck are we doing", "98:57", "but it must be a small percentage of", "99:00", "people in the business that have that", "99:02", "ethic incredibly small and it's", "99:05", "incredibly powerful to have people", "99:07", "backing you that believe in that and and", "99:10", "super rare I mean you know we talk about", "99:13", "in like the film industry today how rare", "99:15", "it is to have true auteur final cut", "99:18", "directors you know left there's only a", "99:20", "handful of them you know largely the", "99:22", "studios have taken over that control", "99:24", "well equally in the television industry", "99:27", "it's it's that rare to have people that", "99:30", "have the kind of power and control to", "99:32", "have the luxury of saying you know hey", "99:35", "listen I have guidelines here and we're", "99:37", "not gonna cross them you know and then", "99:39", "have people you know be like great", "99:42", "go go go make it you know and we were", "99:45", "able to do that yeah it seems like", "99:47", "Netflix would be a really good place for", "99:49", "something like that yeah it seems like", "99:51", "Netflix would be a really good place for", "99:52", "a lot of things yeah it seems like", "99:55", "that's the that's the best place for", "99:57", "like real freedom yeah well I don't know", "100:00", "how much is real free when they're", "100:01", "giving you money anytime someone's", "100:04", "giving you money there's always like you", "100:05", "gotta get but the real way to do it", "100:07", "would be like to produce it yourself but", "100:09", "in the end is CNN was the best place to", "100:12", "do that yeah you know and they really", "100:13", "did back us up yeah and they really", "100:15", "backed up Tony and that philosophy and", "100:17", "they completely implicitly understood", "100:19", "what we were talking about we can't do", "100:22", "that now was Jeff Zucker was it his idea", "100:24", "I you know again I don't know how the", "100:27", "deal came about I assume so because I", "100:29", "think it came it came in just after that", "100:32", "transfer of power so did they did he", "100:34", "have other places where he's thinking", "100:35", "about taking it aside CNN again I don't", "100:38", "know man I don't know I mean they you", "100:40", "know it was a really successful show in", "100:41", "its own right at that point so I'm sure", "100:43", "it would have gone somewhere but that", "100:45", "was it was Jeff Zucker who brought it in", "100:49", "and that was like a just such a", "100:51", "brilliant moves like perfect marriage", "100:53", "you know perfect marriage like perfect", "100:56", "move for CNN like perfect move for us", "100:58", "yeah I thought it was interesting when", "100:59", "they were taking a chance on these", "101:01", "unscripted television shows he's yeah", "101:03", "non news show yeah you've seen United", "101:07", "shades of America yeah have a W he's my", "101:08", "bell and a lot of times it's great he's", "101:11", "the best he's super super nice guy yeah", "101:13", "I did an episode with him in can", "101:15", "you know with Tony which will be the", "101:17", "premiere of this upcoming season okay", "101:19", "you know so how many episodes have you", "101:21", "guys done that haven't aired yet well I", "101:24", "think we'll have seven in this next", "101:27", "season that's the only one of those", "101:32", "seven that was actually completed with", "101:35", "Tony's narration narration the rest of", "101:38", "them are uncomplete and in that respect", "101:42", "and you know we were again we've been", "101:44", "kind of fighting through editing those", "101:46", "over the last few months and and trying", "101:49", "to figure out ways to you know to do", "101:52", "this without completely gutting you know", "101:54", "write them the method of making this", "101:57", "show so and then there's a couple", "102:00", "specials in there like you know talking", "102:02", "to the crew and stuff like that you know", "102:05", "so it's gonna be a pretty profound sea", "102:08", "isn't so once you're done with that you", "102:14", "just start looking at new projects and", "102:16", "different things to do and I have a", "102:18", "couple like assignments already some", "102:20", "projects I'm like pretty excited about", "102:22", "you know I just don't know that they've", "102:24", "officially been announced yet you know", "102:27", "but there's good stuff out there and", "102:29", "there's you know it one nice thing in", "102:34", "all of this incredibly difficult time as", "102:37", "a lot of people have come to us and said", "102:41", "listen we've always believed in what you", "102:43", "guys did and we'd like you to continue", "102:46", "doing and here's a project we have that", "102:48", "we think you know so hopefully we can", "102:52", "continue to make things of the same kind", "102:53", "of looks like we can well it seems like", "102:57", "the success of the show and then the", "102:59", "infectious enthusiasm that Tony had and", "103:04", "that you know so many people were fans", "103:06", "of the show had for that style of", "103:08", "television it's just gonna lead to more", "103:10", "more people taking more chances and", "103:12", "doing things like that I hope so", "103:15", "you know I think so I think it's getting", "103:18", "better you know there will never be", "103:22", "another Tony you won't find that you", "103:24", "know and I think that's something the", "103:28", "you know people will have to
