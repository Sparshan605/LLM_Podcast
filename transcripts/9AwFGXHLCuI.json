because it's dry", "41:07", "and dusty around but it's black yeah oh", "41:08", "yeah I mean it that I see it in my house", "41:10", "too and all right but I mean back there", "41:12", "it's weird

is", "42:40", "getting poisoned Jesus you hope it but", "42:44", "how old is that study and is it still", "42:45", "happening as much like our brake our", "42:47", "brakes made me better now than they were", "42:49", "a few years ago it's the same thing no", "42:51", "the same thing this 2010 brakes are the", "42:53", "same I mean there's no difference there", "42:55", "they're the same fucking things they've", "42:57", "always had these pads they press down", "42:59", "they wear out you got to replace them", "43:00", "and when they're wearing out there", "43:01", "grinding down that powder isn't going", "43:03", "anywhere right someone should probably", "43:05", "figure out a way how to contain that I", "43:07", "mean that seems like what we're doing", "43:10", "now is it just it just goes out into the", "43:12", "atmosphere maybe they should be like", "43:14", "contained like where the powder the", "43:17", "brakes would work the same way but the", "43:19", "powder would have to be like sucked yeah", "43:21", "into some sort of a pouch or something", "43:23", "and you have to change it like a filter", "43:25", "how long would you have to change it", "43:26", "probably all the time", "43:27", "but that seems like that would be like a", "43:30", "real viable alternative like some sort", "43:32", "of encased brake thing you know I mean", "43:35", "that doesn't seem like outside of the", "43:36", "realm of engineering well can they make", "43:38", "the brakes if that sounds unfeasible can", "43:41", "they make the brakes out of something", "43:42", "that is actually just not as bad for you", "43:44", "is there anything they can do that might", "43:46", "be a little bit of a fix well I think", "43:47", "anything you breathe if you breathe in", "43:48", "sawdust it sucks for you", "43:50", "it's a particulate matter like you're", "43:52", "taking in things and you're taking in a", "43:53", "certain kind of dust into your lungs and", "43:56", "becomes an irritant
