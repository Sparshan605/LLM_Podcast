you know when I", "03:25", "was going he wasn't doing you know any", "03:28", "kind of he controlled the pace better", "03:30", "than I thought he was going through you", "03:32", "know I thought once I set that pace that", "03:33", "he was gonna be right there with me but", "03:36", "then as it got going I started to", "03:38", "realize oh he's not really expending", "03:40", "much energy he's kind of just letting me", "03:43", "burn out my energy and in in then he", "03:46", "took his moment when when I made the", "03:48", "last mistake and really went to boil", "03:50", "down to it I lost

so good I knew one slip-up", "04:12", "was gonna be all the need and I think he", "04:14", "knew that too and he was just kind of", "04:16", "waiting buying his time and hoping that", "04:18", "I slip up it seemed like you expended a", "04:20", "lot of energy early on and it seemed", "04:22", "like by the time he got the submission", "04:23", "you were fairly tired yeah I mean", "04:27", "follow she always used to tell me this", "04:29", "and it was always uh there's tired and", "04:31", "can and tired and can't you know it's a", "04:35", "fight it's you're gonna be tired right", "04:37", "uh but I'd still do think I had my legs", "04:40", "underneath me and still could it's just", "04:42", "I could have played it better tactically", "04:46", "I could have had had you know more time", "04:49", "when I wasn't just going going is like", "04:51", "you said especially in that first round", "04:52", "if I would had a little bit better", "04:55", "experience maybe or something I you know", "04:58", "I don't know I'll figure that out but I", "05:00", "could have played it a little smarter", "05:02", "like he did are you do you have a person", "05:05", "that's giving you strategy or are you", "05:07", "sort of making your strategy up on the", "05:09", "fly that's one of the things that that's", "05:12", "kind of the main thing that I'm Robert", "05:15", "faultless was that guy

tell me a little bit of", "05:35", "strategy yeah I think it's so critical", "05:37", "man I really do and we had this", "05:38", "conversation over the phone about it I", "05:40", "think that a young fighter with a lot of", "05:42", "potential like yourself there's a reason", "05:44", "why fighters of trainers there's a", "05:46", "reason why fighters have head coaches", "05:47", "history it's not because they want to", "05:49", "give up all their money yeah it's", "05:50", "because it helps and you you can", "05:52", "delegate those that that thought process", "05:54", "to a master someone

Dominic", "42:42", "Brasil fight apparently he was it was", "42:44", "quite a bit heavier how much have you", "42:46", "anything he was 230 or something that's", "42:49", "a lot of weight yeah super d-wade would", "42:51", "what Deontay Wilder weighed in for", "42:53", "Dominic Brazil I think I think that I", "42:55", "was kind of shocked that he was", "42:56", "somewhere in the two dirties which is", "42:58", "like a normal heavy way to 2223 oh okay", "43:04", "still a little bit of weight but I see", "43:06", "someone's 218 remember when he was in", "43:07", "the prime I wasn't even to 220

"mostly what they were doing was strength", "47:00", "and conditioning and they were saying", "47:02", "basically BJ already knows how to fight", "47:04", "and the real key was to get his gas tank", "47:06", "is fucking thick and fat as possible", "47:09", "just give him this giant ass gas tank", "47:11", "and give him this capacity to work", "47:13", "that's just unprecedented to him and",

having", "55:24", "a hard time making 55 yeah he's growing", "55:26", "into the weight class which max will do", "55:28", "the same you know max is a big dude like", "55:30", "so I think if you if you let him compete", "55:34", "against guys that are more his sausage", "55:36", "eventually the next time that they", "55:38", "fought I think it would look a little", "55:39", "bit different and what

down she's", "55:56", "gonna be too big but I just really", "55:58", "wasn't trying to take him down the way", "55:59", "could be well it's a difference it's a", "56:02", "different fighter yeah but but the way", "56:04", "does his footwork was looking and then", "56:06", "that's what makes you think about it", "56:08", "because you know Kabir's kind of a one", "56:10", "track one train ma you know he's gonna", "56:13", "come right at you you know he's gonna do", "56:14", "- yeah but what if Dustin not even", "56:17", "necessarily can can out wrestle him it's", "56:20", "just it's way easier to play defense on", "56:22", "wrestling than offense and if you've got", "56:24", "great footwork like that - to keep a", "56:27", "your back off the fence might be a long", "56:30", "night if we could be who knows the fight", "56:32", "it's a good fight so find Dustin's got", "56:34", "that serious power yeah it's a good", "56:36", "Dustin can hurt you", "56:37", "yeah zag yep you know southpaw I think", "56:41", "that's gonna play a big factor in it you", "56:42", "know it's a little harder to get in on a", "56:44", "lot of those shots um the real key is", "56:47", "can he stop the takedown and can he", "56:49", "defend himself on the ground because", "56:51", "with so many guys could be gets a hold", "56:53", "of them and then they developed that", "56:54", "thousand-yard stare

the more interesting", "61:40", "aspects about MMA is that you really", "61:42", "can't be the best in the world at", "61:43", "everything and you're gonna have because", "61:45", "it's such a complex reward certainly", "61:52", "can't but you right though I think a lot", "61:54", "of a lot of these other sports and stuff", "61:57", "they've had so many years just to figure", "61:59", "out what works and what don't work", "62:02", "they've really refined the the process", "62:04", "you know enemy huh like you see some of", "62:06", "these high high level boxers and it's", "62:08", "like they've had you know you talk about", "62:10", "somebody like Floyd he's had his dad", "62:12", "fight and his uncle fight before him to", "62:15", "where he's like refined the the process", "62:17", "so much yeah", "62:19", "it's damn near perfect you know I mean", "62:21", "we haven't got to that point yet never", "62:23", "man know it's gonna be a while knows not", "62:26", "even cuz I don't know if we'll ever get", "62:28", "there because it seems like it's because", "62:29", "it's a combination of so many different", "62:31", "disciplines it's you just it doesn't", "62:34", "seem like you're ever gonna see the a", "62:36", "guy who is world-class Muay Thai and", "62:39", "world-class jujitsu and world-class", "62:42", "wrestling all in one fighter it just", "62:44", "doesn't seem like that's really possible", "62:46", "I think you can get it in a couple more", "62:48", "generations don't think so it may be", "62:51", "like four more generations some like", "62:52", "that like because this is it like I look", "62:55", "at the kids now that are coming up and", "62:56", "they don't have the same like", "62:59", "preconceptions that that even I had", "63:02", "coming up and you know like where when", "63:04", "if you boxing your boxing this way and", "63:06", "you know this is the right thing to do", "63:08", "this is the wrong thing to do you know", "63:10", "or you taken you've taken so many things", "63:14", "and you're not really you're kind of", "63:18", "stuck on it you know what I mean and I", "63:19", "feel like each generation is getting a", "63:22", "little bit better a little bit better I", "63:23", "look at like some of the things that", "63:25", "kids do now I'm like fuck like I want to", "63:26", "like wish I could be that free and just", "63:30", "kind of have that that creative process", "63:32", "to do it you know it's gonna happen", "63:35", "eventually I think yeah with little kids", "63:38", "are starting off like a little amateur", "63:40", "fights we were like 10 years old and", "63:42", "shit yeah so then I think about his kid", "63:44", "you know and what's it gonna look like", "63:45", "and then okay then what's his kid gonna", "63:47", "look like to where you will get somebody", "63:50", "who is who is just perfect whatever they", "63:53", "do that's a good point because it really", "63:55", "is a big factor that Floyd had his dad", "63:57", "who was a world-class fighter Sugar Ray", "63:59", "Leonard and his uncle Roger was the", "64:03", "black mamba Roger Mayweather was the", "64:05", "fucking man back in the eighties you", "64:07", "known to see those two guys training him", "64:10", "that is gigantic grown up in that", "64:13", "environment always been around boxing", "64:15", "and they could tell them what to do and", "64:16", "what not to do even when you get to that", "64:18", "certain level you know it's like it's", "64:20", "you don't know what you don't know until", "64:22", "it's too late", "64:23", "almost but you know he had people that", "64:26", "he really respected like his I mean you", "64:29", "your uncle in you and your pops they're", "64:32", "gonna be the first people that you", "64:33", "respect and you got it listen to him", "64:35", "yeah so I think it played a huge factor", "64:37", "that people don't really look at I think", "64:39", "so too and it's also seeing their", "64:40", "mistakes that other fighters have made", "64:42", "when you're growing up in the gym you", "64:44", "seen guys that's spar too hard or seeing", "64:46", "guys that get hit too much or seeing", "64:48", "guys to take the wrong fight so thin", "64:49", "guys don't fight smart defensively you", "64:52", "know one of the things that people", "64:53", "forget is that Floyd went through a big", "64:55", "transition of his own if you go back to", "64:56", "the early parts of his career and you", "64:58", "watch when he was pretty boy floyd yeah", "65:00", "he was a much more aggressive fighter", "65:02", "and he would put himself in danger much", "65:04", "more and then when he became money", "65:06", "Mayweather like as got later and later", "65:08", "in his life he just got so much more", "65:09", "brilliant defensively and then he became", "65:12", "the guy that you see shutting out Canelo", "65:15", "Alvarez stopping all these guys just", "65:17", "just shutting everything down he just", "65:19", "became this defensive wizard to the", "65:21", "point where you'd see world-class", "65:23", "fighters like Sugar Shane Mosley who did", "65:25", "tag him but other

I'm just", "91:46", "signing a contract I don't really give a", "91:47", "fuck", "91:48", "but once somebody who's smarter kind of", "91:51", "takes a look at it and see what's going", "91:53", "on and how it is then then they're gonna", "91:56", "start up something I mean they they have", "91:58", "to I wonder it's kind of think it would", "92:00", "take some sort of crazy lawsuit I would", "92:02", "imagine but I think that fighters are", "92:03", "individuals and then that they they", "92:06", "think of themselves and then if like if", "92:08", "you say I'm gonna join the yeah but",

Poirier big-ass fucking fight a", "106:35", "hundred thousand not even a hundred", "106:37", "thousand bars but that takes away from", "106:38", "our value as fighters you know I mean", "106:42", "cuz that's what I'm saying you don't", "106:42", "truly get to see it that's also because", "106:45", "of streaming because this transition to", "106:47", "ESPN plus it's gonna take a while before",

it's not that's", "109:21", "totally right I think yeah that's", "109:25", "totally right but it limits your ability", "109:27", "to negotiate right because you don't", "109:29", "know like with DIRECTV like a DIRECTV", "109:32", "says there's seven hundred thousand", "109:33", "pay-per-view buys you know big hit", "109:35", "everybody's happy you get a piece of", "109:37", "that like oh boy

it's", "110:18", "free right once you have the zone that's", "110:20", "free which is interesting that the UFC", "110:22", "has a different model of that only thing", "110:24", "I mean is tonello gets 25 million and", "110:27", "then you know Alec cowboy get about a", "110:30", "hundred grand apiece so it's like you", "110:33", "know where's the value in this going on", "110:35", "and then it's not

I mean I thought a the only way", "111:31", "cowboy are the only way I was gonna win", "111:33", "is if he would have knocked him out", "111:34", "early it's just the kicks would have", "111:39", "been too much and it was like I think", "111:41", "that first left switch kick that he", "111:43", "threw and kind of caught out on top of", "111:45", "the head a little bit I think that yeah",

hit so you know that's", "112:17", "something to look at but I think Tony's", "112:19", "just unorthodox movement and in the way", "112:22", "he throws punches and moves his head at", "112:24", "the same time it's throwing punches", "112:26", "cowboy likes to kind of leave his head", "112:28", "up there and in", "112:29", "maybe get hit to the body or something", "112:30", "so Tony's relentless

that with Greg", "117:25", "don't these just the thing with those", "117:28", "guys is when you're rolling with someone", "117:30", "who is that high level with submissions", "117:32", "you are reacting and they know how", "117:35", "you're going to react and they're", "117:36", "anticipating your reaction and they have", "117:38", "a counter to your reaction and you're", "117:41", "always one step behind so you can", "117:42", "explode and explode explode and", "117:44", "eventually you get a little tired then", "117:45", "who hoop and you know Hickson used to", "117:47", "talk about

thought six hours but I", "119:47", "was like because he seems like he's got", "119:50", "that you know systematic way of breaking", "119:54", "stuff down yeah kind of like that", "119:57", "because it takes the guesswork out of it", "120:00", "uh-huh I mean it takes the what if he", "120:02", "does this oh well then he's got an", "120:03", "answer for it when he does this he's got", "120:05", "an answer yeah you know that's why I", "120:08", "feel like I'm kind of missing it Mike", "120:09", "well unnecessarily that my game but yeah", "120:11", "I think that would be a great addition", "120:13", "to anybody's game yes to Train down", "120:15", "there and understand what that guys", "120:16", "doing or I mean there's a there's quite", "120:18", "a few different systems now and then", "120:20", "like you got like Craig Jones who's", "120:21", "coming like I said from Australia he's", "120:23", "got he's got a very similar system to", "120:26", "it's just everybody's got different", "120:27", "approaches to it but what Danaher did", "120:30", "and that hen's Oh Gracie team did is", "120:32", "they just kind of like proof of concept", "120:34", "like just let everybody know hey like", "120:36", "you're missing out on a giant chunk of", "120:39", "this thing and a giant chunk of this", "120:41", "thing is all the variables that come", "120:43", "into play when guys are trying to rip", "120:44", "each other's knees apart yeah yeah it", "120:47", "kind of goes back to even like you know", "120:49", "those individual sports are so ahead of", "120:51", "ours right you know like what we were", "120:54", "talking about earlier when you're seeing", "120:55", "world-class jiu-jitsu fighters or", "120:57", "world-class Muay Thai fighter and", "120:58", "they're just better at that thing the", "121:00", "other guys who do everything yeah so I", "121:02", "mean a couple years ago you saw more", "121:04", "like jiu-jitsu go into back attacks and", "121:07", "you know arm bars were like really big", "121:09", "in it and now you then they kind of went", "121:11", "through like the leg lock era and I feel", "121:13", "like we kind of stuck on the back attack", "121:15", "kind of our bar and eventually we'll", "121:17", "move over to", "121:19", "being able to pull off leg locks because", "121:20", "now you see in a lot of jiu-jitsu guys", "121:22", "kind of get away from leg lock and", "121:23", "starting to under the defense they're", "121:25", "starting to catch up a little bit I", "121:27", "think it to go to Worlds to see it but", "121:29", "you know I'm I always like to stay one", "121:33", "step ahead of it and see where it's", "121:35", "going you know and yeah what's on the", "121:37", "other side it's interesting in the world", "121:39", "they were weighing the fighters before", "121:40", "they got onto the mat that's how you", "121:43", "weighed in yeah you had to make weight", "121:44", "with your Gyan at the side of the mat", "121:47", "and then you drink some water and then", "121:49", "go roll so they're trying to discourage", "121:52", "any and alway cutting that works if", "121:55", "you're not getting hit you know I mean", "121:56", "uh when you talk about like those", "122:00", "punching each other some guys are still", "122:03", "gonna cut weight and that's too big of a", "122:05", "risk to take care of yeah dangerous yeah", "122:08", "very very dangerous yeah your brain is", "122:11", "you know and this was even an idea that", "122:14", "that I had kind of had was like I wonder", "122:16", "why nobody creates some type of", "122:20", "fluid-filled a headgear of some sort you", "122:26", "know what I mean like when you think", "122:27", "about like your brain like your brains", "122:29", "surrounded by that blood that fluid and", "122:31", "that's really what what's protecting it", "122:32", "you know more so than even like the", "122:35", "thickness of your skull or anything so", "122:37", "when you put in you know I I get why", "122:39", "they like boxing amateur boxing is", "122:41", "starting to take away the headgear", "122:42", "because they're saying is making it more", "122:44", "dangerous it's really only helping the", "122:46", "guy who's punching you you know when you", "122:47", "punch somebody with a headgear you can", "122:49", "go play full blast so it's also their", "122:51", "head snaps more because there's weight", "122:53", "on the net it's it's it's actually", "122:55", "making it worse", "122:56", "you know where if you had something that", "122:58", "was fluid-filled kind of recreating the", "123:01", "the inside of your hit then that would", "123:05", "absorb and shake the the water you know", "123:07", "like almost like those are those water", "123:09", "bags you know yeah when you hit those", "123:12", "like you can feel like it's a little it", "123:14", "absorbs the the impact a little bit", "123:18", "different yeah I just wonder I mean I", "123:20", "don't probably not a good idea like", "123:22", "maybe if you bus it and you got water", "123:24", "fucking flow it everywhere zone that's a", "123:26", "big deal but I think you're right that", "123:28", "makes sense if they could design it", "123:30", "correctly", "123:31", "you out a way to disperse the impact", "123:33", "matter yeah that's a good idea yeah yeah", "123:37", "I mean I don't know I they they should", "123:39", "just do some serious testing on now I", "123:41", "don't know why I'm part of the Cleveland", "123:44", "Clinic over in in in Vegas they they've", "123:47", "got this study going on for a couple", "123:49", "years where they take you in and they", "123:50", "they run you through an MRI scan and", "123:53", "they do all these different type of", "123:54", "tests on you on a lot on the computer", "123:57", "like testing your reaction skills", "123:58", "testing your balance testing all the you", "124:01", "know different parts of your brain it's", "124:03", "been a couple years now I think I've", "124:04", "been part of them for like four years I", "124:06", "go in twice a year to get it done but", "124:09", "that just seems like it's gonna take so", "124:11", "long", "124:12", "or you really notice anything and when", "124:14", "you do that do they tell you your", "124:16", "results based on how you were six months", "124:18", "ago yeah they give me that I actually", "124:20", "just expert MRI scans cuz they tell you", "124:23", "and they're just like yeah no you're", "124:25", "fine like you know like your results are", "124:27", "big because it's kind of the same test", "124:29", "that you're takin over and over and over", "124:30", "again huh so you just kind of match them", "124:32", "up to how you did last time and you know", "124:35", "if you scored a 98 on the last one you", "124:38", "scored a 98 on this one it's like okay", "124:40", "that's cool you know", "124:41", "yeah you've you find but to me I asked", "124:44", "them for the actual MRI scans I don't", "124:46", "know how to read an MRI like that right", "124:47", "but you know cuz I want to see like even", "124:50", "them it's got to be deeper than that", "124:52", "it's got to be deeper than 2+2 and you", "124:54", "know all this shit like it's gotta be", "124:56", "something more to it like they should", "124:58", "just do a study where they take a", "125:00", "ballistic hit and hit it no bunch of", "125:03", "times see what's happenin to the brain", "125:06", "of it yeah right right left Francis", "125:08", "punch it yeah like I want to know you", "125:11", "know I think and I think fans like wanna", "125:14", "know that you don't want to give your", "125:15", "brain to this shit right you know it's", "125:17", "like and then you could do stuff where", "125:19", "you put something over put a header on", "125:21", "it see if it makes it worse put it like", "125:24", "say it water hit gear you think you're", "125:25", "ever gonna get to a point where they'll", "125:26", "have a study that they can like a test", "125:28", "like that I could do in a fighter and", "125:30", "they'll say hey man you can't fight", "125:31", "anymore yeah free shuttles they really", "125:33", "don't have that right now which is why", "125:34", "they let Chuck Liddell fight ta Ortiz", "125:36", "right yeah I think uh just like em are", "125:40", "like an MRI you know like a couple years", "125:42", "ago", "125:43", "no you wouldn't be able to get the same", "125:45", "type of imaging and now when you see", "125:47", "like some of the stuff that they're", "125:48", "really coming out with medically I think", "125:51", "that's gonna advance so much more to", "125:53", "where you're gonna really be able to see", "125:55", "like the individual neurons and inside", "125:57", "on you guys see like okay you're", "125:59", "breaking up these these parts of your", "126:01", "brain that we couldn't see before you", "126:04", "know you can't see what an x-ray you", "126:05", "couldn't see it with a 1-hour MRI a lot", "126:07", "of times they can't see until the", "126:08", "autopsy right right so hopefully as", "126:11", "technology improves and as we get better", "126:13", "on that front like then we can just", "126:16", "start to take some of that that", "126:21", "technology and use it for what we doing", "126:24", "you know yeah well Kevin Lee it's been a", "126:26", "blast let's do it again six months let", "126:29", "me know what here a year will be a year", "126:31", "a year a little thank you brother", "126:33", "appreciate
