crazy shit yeah just", "20:21", "because the way he moved and guys are", "20:24", "boys I've always been drawn in guys like", "20:25", "that like Ali even Rashad when he was in", "20:28", "his prime

mean he was a master before we", "20:42", "really saw it from Mayweather Mayweather", "20:43", "obviously he gets hit less than anybody", "20:48", "that's ever lived", "20:48", "yeah you think about the fact that guy", "20:50", "is 50 you know and really I mean you", "20:53", "think about talks well doesn't this", "20:55", "Ostler a good count uh-huh yeah I mean", "20:58", "equipped him with one left hand like", "21:00", "real clean and that was uppercut", "21:02", "yeah a couple other punches but none of", "21:05", "them were like dangerous he rolled with", "21:07", "them yeah I rolled with everything", "21:08", "fucked up in my fight because I at one", "21:11", "point after I felt his jab I was like", "21:12", "you know what I can just close the", "21:15", "distance a little bit more and then", "21:16", "that's how I got this shiner right here", "21:18", "but the right hands this right side is", "21:19", "fine cuz I was just rolling with a lot", "21:21", "of them I was rolling with a lot of them", "21:22", "so you just underestimated his jab I", "21:24", "underestimated his head movement at", "21:27", "first so in the beginning he was moving", "21:29", "away from my jab and I usually said I", "21:30", "drop it down drop it down to the chin a", "21:31", "little bit and I did but eventually I", "21:35", "could adjust I think from round two I", "21:37", "figure out the range but his jab it", "21:40", "wasn't as powerful as I want as I", "21:42", "assumed it would be so I thought I can", "21:44", "just take and give and that's how I got", "21:45", "this shiner right into one of them but", "21:47", "yeah it was a big mistake silly mistake", "21:49", "so on the same card Uriah Hall fought", "21:53", "polo coach yeah what a lot of people are", "21:56", "thinking that might be the next fight", "21:57", "four years old Dana funny story so we", "21:59", "went to him I hope after my fight I", "22:02", "chilled in my hotel room just hung all", "22:03", "my boys but then after dance but I went", "22:05", "out and someone told all Dana's in this", "22:08", "club he's saying oh that's whatever", "22:10", "and when I got some money and I was", "22:12", "talking to the guy that led me and then", "22:14", "cuz he found out my UFC fighter he just", "22:16", "led me to the private room and I see", "22:18", "McMahon I might what the hell and then", "22:19", "we just thought yawning I talking to", "22:21", "people and he's a cheater Dana and I", "22:23", "finally meet Dana properly and we start", "22:24", "talking and I dropped this name in there", "22:26", "say yeah I want to fight Paula next and", "22:28", "he's like and they have other ideas you", "22:30", "know fair enough but I can they've done", "22:32", "this a long time they're promoters you", "22:34", "know so I think what they want is me you", "22:38", "know being a bigger name Paul being a", "22:40", "bigger name and we fight like in some", "22:42", "super fight mm-hmm I mean and I can see", "22:44", "what that you know why that but for me I", "22:46", "wanna I want to take him out now he just", "22:48", "knocked out VR Hall yeah was talking mad", "22:50", "shit as well you know but yeah I want to", "22:53", "take him out now before because he's", "22:55", "gonna probably fight again we'll", "22:57", "probably fight more than once cuz he's", "22:58", "in one of those guy well see what", "23:00", "happens how long is the UFC career last", "23:02", "but I think he'll probably fly with me", "23:03", "and probably fight more than once yeah I", "23:05", "would imagine that as well I was very", "23:07", "impressed with him versus Uriah Hall", "23:09", "it's interesting because the contrast", "23:10", "between your fight on Friday night and", "23:12", "his fight on Saturday night that was", "23:13", "just a brawl like a technical brawl", "23:15", "mm-hmm he got hit with a lot of jabs but", "23:17", "he is a relentless marauding", "23:19", "motherfucker that guys he's yeah and", "23:23", "this thing's footwork Uriah Hall I was", "23:25", "watching my why you right there it's", "23:27", "easy to look good against someone who", "23:28", "just sits right there like a punching", "23:29", "bag you know Uriah had tremendous", "23:33", "potential when we saw him in the", "23:35", "Ultimate Fighter sorry but it also might", "23:37", "be similar to what you were talking", "23:39", "about with sage Northcutt where who are", "23:41", "also think as true still has tremendous", "23:42", "potential and still very young yeah I", "23:44", "think there's an approach to take that", "23:46", "you took that I think is really smart", "23:48", "you know where I got it from one of the", "23:50", "talk shows UFC talk shows kenny floor", "23:52", "and just said it he said um get your", "23:54", "experience outside the UFC before you go", "23:56", "them in the UFC was words ten fights", "23:59", "nine fights and just like fight a lot of", "24:02", "good guys not just like some you know", "24:03", "listen to me man you don't want to fight", "24:04", "you on your second fight right imagine", "24:08", "you're a guy you can throw a couple good", "24:10", "punches you think you're a badass and", "24:11", "then you're stupid coach says okay you", "24:13", "gonna fight this guy they call him the", "24:14", "style bender fight anybody I'll fight", "24:20", "for the title mentality yeah", "24:22", "those guys they get lit up and they", "24:24", "don't understand they really don't", "24:25", "understand jump in a pool to quick", "24:27", "conversation with a friend of mine who's", "24:28", "a jujitsu he was badass Jiu Jitsu and he", "24:30", "said he was going to go into MMA and I'm", "24:34", "like okay how long you been training", "24:35", "striking and

fella jujitsu like nasty on the", "24:44", "ground I'll think about what you could", "24:46", "do if I was a white belt and I came in", "24:49", "here and I didn't know shit and I was", "24:50", "like a strong guile maybe you know", "24:52", "played basketball or something like that", "24:53", "was just aesthetic and I tried to fight", "24:55", "you how bad would you fuck me up on the", "24:57", "ground right now", "24:58", "think of someone doing the exact same", "25:00", "thing like that to you would stand up", "25:03", "because you don't understand that there", "25:05", "are guys who can do that lows there's a", "25:07", "Tyrone Spong there's you there's these", "25:09", "high level kickboxer say you don't have", "25:12", "a chance you think you have a chance cuz", "25:14", "you're

until they decide to move in", "25:21", "for the kill and they're gonna fuck you", "25:22", "up there's not a damn thing you could do", "25:24", "about it and it's almost the same as him", "25:27", "grabbing a white belt letting him flail", "25:28", "around and then eventually choking him", "25:30", "it's an inevitable thing but the weird", "25:31", "thing is some people don't see that they", "25:34", "don't see that someone could do to them", "25:35", "in a certain art they don't study", "25:37", "objectivity yeah that's the thing like", "25:39", "for me I'm always thinking like in", "25:41", "anything why am I doing this why am I", "25:43", "feeling this way right or right or wrong", "25:44", "and that's why I said I moved to any", "25:46", "makers I just know I want to be the best", "25:48", "you know I could have been the best", "25:49", "kickboxer ever I think that best boxer", "25:51", "as well but I just thought in my eyes", "25:54", "the guy who could fuck you agree

"obviously they say everybody's different", "26:43", "but there's something around age 30 to", "26:46", "32 where your mind and body catch up and", "26:48", "you have a window there like Anderson", "26:50", "Silva when he was like 32 32 was going I", "26:53", "remember that was right the first one I", "26:59", "saw alive was UFC 90", "27:01", "he fought Patrick Cote oh yes but like", "27:05", "for me that far is very smart but that", "27:07", "first round he used like probably seven", "27:08", "different styles to just hit him and", "27:10", "then I keep saying he uses telekinesis", "27:12", "on his knee he just blowed it out but", "27:14", "like Patrick had a fucked-up knee going", "27:15", "into that final thing already hard to", "27:17", "tell but it seemed like he gave it was", "27:19", "good fight it was a good fight he just", "27:20", "stood out in just yeah went to like", "27:23", "throw a front kick and it just buckled", "27:24", "on and hopped out yeah number like

Anderson trouble", "27:36", "though because the recipe to give me a", "27:37", "nurse instruct Alice latest opened it up", "27:39", "and so in mind Cote know but the real", "27:42", "key was don't
