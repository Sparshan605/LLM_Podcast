360", "03:28", "that has been modified in certain ways", "03:31", "his authority has more than 400", "03:33", "horsepower well it also had turbos and", "03:35", "it's not like you just wouldn't use an", "03:38", "f40 engine for that it would just be it", "03:39", "would be like using something that's", "03:43", "very valuable and not really replaceable", "03:46", "force for for purposes of modification", "03:49", "doesn't make much sense when other", "03:51", "options are available that could deliver", "03:52", "you the same result like a 360 what did", "03:54", "a 360 have when it came with the Modena", "03:56", "like foreign horsepower yeah look around", "03:58", "480 knows gotta be like was other Tino", "04:00", "was lighter pounds yeah maybe it may be", "04:03", "very tiny they're tiny and they're made", "04:06", "enough that I mean they're 2,500 maybe a", "04:08", "good number", "04:09", "yeah and if you I've heard that car that", "04:12", "car lives here really yeah that car", "04:14", "lives in Los Angeles the black it lives", "04:16", "here I've seen more shows yeah that's", "04:17", "got sounds the darker is mass it's weird", "04:21", "because you actually have to yes it", "04:24", "probably is a half a million dollars", "04:26", "with", "04:26", "very low estimate for 705 maybe a really", "04:30", "good original Dino is there it is so", "04:32", "it's actually that's not the car because", "04:34", "the car is a hardtop or is it a target", "04:36", "oh look how pretty is that off if that", "04:39", "picture with the back end of it right", "04:40",

"04:50", "to look for obviously that badge on the", "04:52", "left that says like Evo something and", "04:54", "then the clear engine cover with the big", "04:57", "bubble in the middle of the of the", "04:58", "engine bonnet is changed yeah by the way", "05:00", "that badge can go fuck itself the badge", "05:02", "doesn't need to be yeah the exhaust is a", "05:05", "little bigger", "05:06",

be", "05:43", "a 2.8 liter engine", "05:45", "yeah with turbo with turbos yeah god", "05:47", "that's a pretty car let me just by the", "05:48", "way if it had an f40 engine it would be", "05:50", "a fucking death trap you would sail that", "05:53", "thing with 400 horsepower it's got to be", "05:56", "crazy yeah but you know what it's it's", "05:58", "gonna be linear right without the turbo", "06:00", "spool yeah you know you have that", "06:02", "natural build of power and you really", "06:04", "kind of can just use less throttle it", "06:06", "won't just jump out at you yeah but I", "06:09", "mean you are a man of taste Joe that's", "06:11", "awesome it's a beautiful ride look at", "06:13", "that thing they're selling them yeah", "06:15", "they're trying to build a run of them oh", "06:17", "I think they're like a singer yeah yeah", "06:19", "yeah but here's the problem with with", "06:22", "with doing this with Ferraris though", "06:24", "Ferrari people even if you did something", "06:28", "to the level of singer Ferrari people", "06:32", "aren't really like that Ferrari people", "06:34", "are originality over everything", "06:37", "that's so weird yeah I don't understand", "06:39", "all like they don't like", "06:40", "modifying the cars they don't like about", "06:42", "car that's previously been modified it's", "06:44", "all about that numbers-matching shit no", "06:47", "it's not it's not for you", "06:48", "no no it's not really for me either I", "06:50", "love driving the Ferraris but like I", "06:52", "don't align with like that the Ferrari",

has a Testarossa", "07:05", "completely redone he's like fuck you we", "07:09", "put a new interior and a modern stereo", "07:11", "everything it's probably nice they need", "07:13", "a lot of maintenance though they have", "07:15", "testarossa's have timing belts see", "07:18", "timing belts are something that Italians", "07:21", "we're doing for a long time and the", "07:23", "people they should just never be done", "07:24", "again sounds terrif they wear out and", "07:26", "they need to be changed and in the case", "07:28", "of the Testarossa you're talking about a", "07:30", "giant flat 12 engine there in the front", "07:34", "so they're up against the firewall", "07:36", "behind the seats so you have to take off", "07:38", "the whole back of the car take the whole", "07:40", "engine out of the car", "07:41", "to do these timing belt oh yeah starting", "07:44", "with the modern stuff they use chains", "07:48", "the 21st century and they don't have to", "07:51", "fucking fuck with belts that he wants", "07:53", "yes but even like Lamborghini at the", "07:55", "time like I have a Countach which is the", "07:57", "best car ever made and you don't have to", "08:00", "do that bullshit cuz even Lamborghini", "08:01", "use chains so you don't need to do the", "08:03", "engine now why did ferrari go with belts", "08:05", "I think they thought it was smoother for", "08:08", "our Enzo Ferrari also had utter contempt", "08:10", "for the people who bought his street", "08:11", "cars and I wouldn't be surprised if he", "08:13", "did it just so the dealers would make", "08:16", "more money on the services even if he", "08:17", "knew it was worse why did he have so", "08:19", "much contempt for the people about his", "08:20", "cars Enzo Ferrari just wanted to go", "08:22", "racing all he he was an egomaniac and", "08:24", "all he ever wanted to do was see his", "08:26", "cars win races and he came to a point", "08:28", "where he couldn't make money doing that", "08:30", "and he had to sell street cars to", "08:33", "customers but throughout his entire life", "08:35", "he openly treated those people with", "08:38", "disdain that's how you when that's the", "08:39", "story of Lamborghini the story of", "08:41", "Lamborghini is Ferruccio Lamborghini had", "08:44", "a Ferrari it was not working for one", "08:47", "reason other he went to Ferrari to", "08:49", "complain about it Enzo basically told me", "08:51", "to fuck himself and somebody said I'll", "08:53", "build the better come", "08:53", "and that's the story of Lamborghini and", "08:56", "their what are they known by now is", "08:59", "almost like an Audi Group yeah via V AG", "09:02", "so they're more reliable now yes but so", "09:04", "are Ferraris around 2010 yes when the", "09:10", "the four or five eight came out", "09:14", "Ferraris took a massive jump in", "09:17", "reliability how they do that first off", "09:19", "the big one is the dual clutch gearbox", "09:21", "which you know stick shifts for one", "09:24", "thing right and then these early single", "09:26", "clutch paddle shift gearbox they'd fry", "09:28", "clutches like crazy people didn't really", "09:30", "know how to use them right and they", "09:32", "dried the clutches out and they would", "09:33", "just go through clutches like crazy the", "09:35", "dual clutch cars have much more like", "09:39", "failsafe type stuff built into them and", "09:41", "they actually work properly", "09:43", "Ferraris to have the gated shift the", "09:46", "coolest things up Yankee clink it's the", "09:49", "best sliding into gear yes there's", "09:51", "nothing more rewarding than like banging", "09:54", "a Ferrari off the reveler and they stop", "09:58", "that people stops the problem with with", "10:01", "Ferrari is that they're new you know", "10:04", "with the problem all new exotic the", "10:06", "first owners of exotic cars is they want", "10:09", "that new technology that's that's from", "10:11", "racing and also it's like it's improved", "10:14", "the drivability you know if you want to", "10:15", "buy a Ferrari or a Lamborghini and drive", "10:17", "it around in the city and use it as a", "10:19", "car you can buy a Ferrari right now and", "10:21", "it could just be your car like that was", "10:23", "there that wasn't a thing you could do", "10:25", "really in the 70s or 80s or even 90s", "10:28", "like you could literally use a modern", "10:31", "exotic car be it Ferrari Lamborghini", "10:33", "McLaren howdy all right whatever that", "10:35", "could be your only car now and that the", "10:39", "gearbox technology is a lot of what's", "10:40", "made that possible and", "10:41", "computer-controlled like engine", "10:43", "management systems this is a little", "10:46", "disappointing one thing I'm really happy", "10:49", "the Porsche hasn't done that but they", "10:51", "have with the gt3 RS a gt3 RS just this", "10:54", "last year and now the new ones what do", "10:57", "you mean all the automatic all", "10:58", "automatically RS though the RS is in in", "11:02", "Porsche speak is the fastest version of", "11:05", "what they can build they have the GTV", "11:07", "touring with a stick that's the one you", "11:08", "want you want the touring because it's a", "11:11", "fucking stick because the four liter", "11:13", "engine with a stat 6-speed gearbox is", "11:15", "the best engine transmission combination", "11:17", "available in cars today period", "11:20", "yeah but the wide-body GT TRS with the", "11:23", "vented fenders and you can modify you", "11:25", "can modify later you just complained", "11:28", "about people who don't want to modify by", "11:30", "modifying but all that extra effort why", "11:32", "don't they just fucking sell to you with", "11:34", "a stick shift I don't know bro talk to", "11:37", "the Germans I can't fucking win there", "11:39", "mate look they make a gt3 with a stick", "11:41", "they maybe Cayman gt4 with a stick they", "11:44", "make the Boxster Spyder with a stick you", "11:46", "could buy a 911 any level of 911 with a", "11:48", "stick you can buy the turbo not the", "11:50", "turbo there are the only ones you can", "11:51", "count on though it seems like it's all", "11:53", "going to even Corvette the new quarter", "11:55", "that's double clutch yeah they said the", "11:57", "new gt500 they haven't ruled out the", "12:00", "possibility yeah of having a stick shift", "12:02", "but well so look with the gt500 they", "12:05", "just announced this thing it's it's like", "12:06", "750 horsepower no I've driven a lot of", "12:09", "really powerful manual transmission cars", "12:11", "for me once the car goes over about five", "12:14", "hundred I don't want to shift anymore", "12:16", "really I don't when I'm driving it on", "12:20", "like a racetrack as fast as it will go", "12:22", "okay like when I went to test the the", "12:23", "the Corvette zr1 the last front engine", "12:26", "one when it went just completely fucking", "12:28", "bananas right 750 horsepower I went to", "12:30", "Road Atlanta to drive it and they had a", "12:32", "manual and they had an automatic me to", "12:34", "drive and I drove the manual and it was", "12:36", "so fucking fast that I did not feel", "12:38", "comfortable taking my hand off the wheel", "12:40", "to do the shifts that make sense and and", "12:42", "I was like at this level of performance", "12:44", "I really need to have both my hands on", "12:47", "the wheel and I'm a pretty decent driver", "12:48", "I'm not like shit I'm not the best but", "12:50", "I'm not shit right and then when I drove", "12:52", "the automatic car I went okay I feel way", "12:56", "more comfortable at this pace with my", "12:57", "hands on the wheel right but this", "12:59", "8-speed automatic would they have is the", "13:01", "biggest hunk of flamin shit", "13:03", "ever put into a sports car and so with", "13:05", "the c8 with the new one they got rid of", "13:08", "the manual and decided to substantially", "13:12", "improve the auto with a new dual clutch", "13:15", "8-speed which", "13:17", "you know for you and for me is sad that", "13:20", "there's no stick it's not kind to get it", "13:22", "because it's just sort of what progress", "13:24", "looks I get it if you're gonna take it", "13:26", "to a race track yeah I do get it but how", "13:28", "many people are taking their goddamn", "13:30", "Corvette to race no it's not even really", "13:32", "about that it's sadder it's sadder than", "13:34", "that", "13:34", "it's really about how do we get the 0 to", "13:37", "60 time under three seconds because when", "13:41", "they had the zo6 which was 650", "13:43", "horsepower and then they had the zr1", "13:44", "which was 750 horsepower they couldn't", "13:47", "get it to 60 any faster Detroit is still", "13:50", "so suck in fucking zero to 60 that that", "13:53", "that is important for some reason and", "13:55", "adding a hundred horsepower didn't", "13:57", "change the 0 to 60 because of the", "13:59", "front-engine rear-drive your distraction", "14:01", "limited at that point just burnouts yeah", "14:03", "so by putting the engine in the back you", "14:05", "change the weight distribution now", "14:07", "you've got a dual clutch 8-speed instead", "14:09", "of a manual 7-speed now you can get in", "14:13", "that two-second range 260 which doesn't", "14:15", "improve the experience but it doesn't", "14:18", "prove the number on that magazine cover", "14:19", "with in number but everybody know I mean", "14:22", "how do you not know it's a it's a", "14:24", "fucking fast car ya know it's fast the", "14:27", "GT 500s a real bummer though because", "14:29", "that's a such a muscle car you know it's", "14:31", "a sex your muscle car it's a it's a it's", "14:33", "a toot same version of the Tremec dual", "14:35", "clutch from the corvette is it as in the", "14:37", "Mustang yeah it has a different number", "14:38", "of gears incidentally it has a set it's", "14:41", "a 7-speed in the Mustang and an 8-speed", "14:43", "in the Corvette but it's same family of", "14:44", "brand-new Tremec dual clutch gearboxes", "14:46", "what has a wider contact with the tires", "14:49", "I don't know what the Mustangs got if I", "14:53", "had to guess you see a narrower right if", "14:55", "I had to guess the Mustang had water see", "14:57", "eight Corvettes 305 rears that I yeah", "15:00", "yeah it's not you know with a mid-engine", "15:02", "car what is interesting about a", "15:03", "mid-engine car as you find this a lot I", "15:05", "bet if you went out and looked at a", "15:07", "Ferrari like a four five eight or", "15:08", "something you'd be shocked at how narrow", "15:10", "the tires are really yeah when you do a", "15:11", "mid-engine car you can give up a lot of", "15:13", "that huge fat rear rubber because the", "15:16", "weight distribution doesn't necessitate", "15:18", "it wait.you", "15:19", "a tire tire sizes are typically chosen", "15:21", "by the weight distribution of the car so", "15:24", "like your 911 euro air cooled car your", "15:27", "old one right so you got", "15:28", "fat rears and you've got relatively", "15:30", "skinny fronts that's because that engine", "15:32", "is over the rears so in a mid-engined", "15:34", "like I just looked this up for an", "15:36", "unrelated thing in the four five eight", "15:38", "the front tires are only two 45s on that", "15:41", "and the rear tires are 305 so where is a", "15:44", "Corvette your front tires are like 275", "15:47", "the old Corvette front tires are 275", "15:49", "rears like a 335 that that difference in", "15:52", "weight distribution is how big of a",

you", "63:06", "think about moving pan Sunshine's free", "63:09", "and weeds legal so nice good I know", "63:12", "that's corny as fuck but makes me go", "63:14", "let's do it it goes a long way yo what", "63:17", "about that Kevin Smith shit Kevin Smith", "63:19", "was up and you're talking about his", "63:21", "snooty boo cheese bro just weed I know", "63:23", "it isn't I know it is but I had to", "63:26", "thought when I was listening to your", "63:27", "show and it was like you're telling me", "63:30", "the fictional drug dealer from that", "63:33", "movie I loved when I was 13 is now a", "63:35", "real drug dealer but legally and as that", "63:38", "movie character that is some crazy-ass", "63:41", "shit yeah that's basically what is it", "63:43", "like Tyson weed this is Mike

giant fat", "63:59", "blunt that looks like poison crazy", "64:01", "that is awesome all right it's pretty", "64:04", "fucking good dude what do we need to", "64:06", "talk about with cars is there anything", "64:07", "else shouting in the industry that you", "64:09", "want to know about well I mean the tie", "64:11", "can I don't think we've like completely", "64:13", "covered it no my question with all these", "64:16", "cars is what is next right it's like", "64:19", "right we're seeing these incredible 0 to", "64:21", "60 under 3 second times yeah see we're", "64:24", "going to eventually see the range", "64:26", "increase but if you had asked me 10", "64:29", "years ago are we gonna see a 2.4 zero to", "64:33", "60 sedan that feels like it's violating", "64:37", "physics when you stomp on the gas I mean", "64:39", "that's what I Drive and yeah laptop for", "64:41", "a screen yeah we've gotten to a about I", "64:45", "don't know right right", "64:46", "maybe 10 years ago or so the the the", "64:50", "trajectory of increased", "64:52", "performance got very steep yeah where", "64:55", "you know the new version of every car", "64:57", "has a hundred more horsepower and now", "65:00", "we've got these high-performance V's and", "65:02", "with a high-performance Eevee you know", "65:04", "you built a dragster that that's a", "65:06", "fuckin dragster I mean the the the Tyco", "65:08", "on does your does the quarter-mile on", "65:10", "the low tens I mean so you can you know", "65:13", "I don't want to be flippant and say all", "65:16", "it takes is money but all it takes is", "65:18", "money", "65:18", "you walk into a dealer and you buy in a", "65:20", "dragster that you know you you're", "65:22", "sitting in an arch NHRA license to run", "65:24", "that fast now you could do it on the way", "65:26", "to Whole Foods that's great you know and", "65:28", "so with Taikan the real difference for", "65:30", "me but sweet I get in Tesla is the", "65:34", "steering and handling because Tesla's", "65:37", "have very videogame be steering it's", "65:39", "accurate and it's sharp but it's not I", "65:41", "don't feel it know this the Taikan has", "65:43", "the steering system from the Porsche 919", "65:45", "and so it feels like a Porsche and so", "65:48", "when I drove it I texted you I go Joe", "65:51", "this is for you well Tesla figured out", "65:54", "how to make it go fast and they figured", "65:56", "out how to make it handle pretty good", "65:58", "and make it cool they figured how to", "65:59", "make it an Eevee cool because v's", "66:01", "remember the rav4 eveything ed begley", "66:04", "was driving in the 90s like what is this", "66:06", "Jamie video that I was one of the things", "66:09", "that makes Porsche Taikan different is", "66:11", "they have a two speed transmission your", "66:12", "Tesla is one gear so your Tesla from", "66:15", "zero to 120 is bananas but it pretty", "66:19", "much dies off because it runs out of", "66:21", "gear because most people don't really", "66:23", "need to go faster than that but Porsche", "66:24", "with their auto bond stuff they need", "66:27", "more at the top end so the tie can", "66:30", "actually switches into second gear and", "66:32", "keeps pulling like crazy you know above", "66:35", "80 to 100 miles an hour", "66:37", "and the biggest difference though", "66:38", "dynamically is like you know how in your", "66:40", "Tesla you can drive with one foot like", "66:43", "one pedal when you lift off the pedal it", "66:45", "breaks the car yeah and so you can", "66:47", "pretty much drive around one foot Taikan", "66:49", "doesn't do that so Porsche believes that", "66:53", "the kinetic energy built up by motion is", "66:57", "better used by allowing the car to just", "67:00", "coast as far as possible than by hitting", "67:03", "the region and capturing it in the four", "67:06", "of breaking the way that Tesla does now", "67:08", "you can turn that function off in the", "67:10", "Tesla does that have an impact on what", "67:14", "but if it's doing that does it does it", "67:16", "have an impact on the way it feels well", "67:20", "it feels I mean yes because you have to", "67:23", "use the brakes more in every time a car", "67:26", "quicker to use the brakes more to do it", "67:28", "mean to do have regenerative do we know", "67:30", "it doesn't necessarily slow the car down", "67:32", "faster just means easy to zero time no", "67:36", "in fact if I I believe that Porsche is", "67:38", "ultimately better at that it's did that", "67:41", "the only real difference is that when", "67:44", "you lift off the gas and a Tesla it", "67:46", "slows down as if someone is applying the", "67:49", "brakes yeah in the Porsche you just pure", "67:52", "coast it's a pure coast and it and it's", "67:54", "a really it's it's an even more of a", "67:57", "coast that feeling than a gasoline car", "68:00", "it's like you're freed of all restraint", "68:03", "like because after I'm fuckin mobbed up", "68:06", "the mountain in that video that I sent", "68:07", "you yeah I was like oh shit dude I've", "68:10", "only got like 40 miles of range left I", "68:12", "gotta get off this bloody Hill yeah and", "68:14", "so I was at the high point in the hill", "68:16", "and I go let's coast and so I just", "68:18", "coasted and I was like let's see how far", "68:20", "I can go without touching the brakes and", "68:22", "I got this motherfucker coasting up to", "68:24", "like a hundred miles an hour taking", "68:26", "corners and not using the brace because", "68:28", "the handling and the grip are so good I", "68:30", "coached in like 12 miles down the hill -", "68:32", "what about a deer what about a boy", "68:33", "groaning boy

"83:57", "all this technology yeah we're opening", "84:00", "up this new realm of human communication", "84:02", "I think by just by making every byte you", "84:06", "know by breaking it into two e's you", "84:09", "know it's gotta be the short thoughts", "84:11", "and all that's an angry man yeah but", "84:13", "just in terms of like if you watch like", "84:16", "look it our access to the news like our", "84:21", "access to like these stories that are", "84:23", "going on in Hong Kong you could like", "84:24", "specifically focus on and try to follow", "84:26", "and you can follow it pretty

"well I think we're just aware of way", "85:03", "more information than we're supposed to", "85:05", "be overlooked all the load and I think", "85:08", "that's one of the reasons why so many", "85:09", "people are anxious I think just our", "85:13", "sheer numbers are wearing on like the", "85:15", "way we feel I actually have developed", "85:18", "like real anxiety just about fucking", "85:20", "life which I think it's directly related", "85:23", "probably to like my internet consumption", "85:25", "you know what I mean oh for sure", "85:28", "I think use like social media of
