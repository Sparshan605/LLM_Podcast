the", "02:32", "filler forward down but I feel like that", "02:34", "could be one of the when you listen to a", "02:36", "lot of the great fighters in the past", "02:38", "they talk about a right-handed southpaw", "02:40", "there's so many advantages they can be", "02:42", "there and it's just it's just always", "02:44", "great to be able to switch up and change", "02:46", "time and

"03:16", "you know well some guys do it but", "03:18", "there's a twist right like Wonder Boy", "03:20", "does it but when Wonder Boy does it you", "03:22", "know that the front leg is coming yeah", "03:24", "and then he's you know he's he can fight", "03:27", "any style I mean he could fight left or", "03:29", "right but when he switches when he goes", "03:30", "right you know that front leg side kicks", "03:33", "coming that front leg roundhouse kick is", "03:34", "coming and then when he stands Orthodox", "03:36", "he's much more likely to throw a punch", "03:38", "or you know maybe even spin he mixes it", "03:41", "up but he's limited maybe in the way he", "03:45", "attacks the blending yeah but I think", "03:47", "Wonder Boy is one of those guys that his", "03:49", "switches are like really you could see", "03:52", "him coming", "03:53", "you know the he makes him really", "03:55", "pronounced you know they're big switches", "03:56", "and you know the the attacks that are", "03:58", "coming there's certain guys like TJ", "04:00", "Dillashaw who was great at mixing it up", "04:02", "completely right where I feel like he", "04:04", "doesn't sit down on his punches too much", "04:06", "or you know he gets in spots where he", "04:07", "can get clipped in between those with", "04:09", "your feet off the ground so I try and", "04:11", "find the happy medium between those two", "04:13", "switching up too much and being able to", "04:15", "make those hard switches to it well TJ's", "04:17", "really been doing that style for just", "04:19", "like three or four years now since he's", "04:20", "been with bang maybe it's about I want", "04:23", "to say three years four years yeah", "04:24", "probably some of it takes some time to", "04:26", "get used to", "04:26", "we get used to the timing and everything", "04:28", "and and that's one of the things with me", "04:29", "like I try to be the most consistent guy", "04:32", "that there is out there so the more", "04:33", "consistently I'm getting in there the", "04:34", "more I'm seeing things coming I'm I'm", "04:36", "reading the angles and you know getting", "04:39", "a lot of different looks a lot of", "04:40", "different bodies being thrown at me", "04:42", "so all that adds up to experience and", "04:45", "you know it's only gonna get better from", "04:46", "there yeah it's also one of those things", "04:48", "when you're 25 years old you you still", "04:50", "are like realistically five years away", "04:53", "from your athletic prime yeah I get it I", "04:56", "keep that in the back of my mind", "04:57", "sometimes because that you know you", "04:58", "obviously don't want to overwork the", "04:59", "body too much you don't want to burn out", "05:01", "but I think it's just staying consistent", "05:04", "and staying healthy as long as I'm", "05:06", "healthy through it you know I got", "05:07", "through that fight no no serious damages", "05:09", "at all and that's the most important", "05:11", "thing is just staying healthy when I'm", "05:13", "young and then you know tailing back", "05:15", "when I'm starting to get more damages or", "05:17", "more injuries but I'd do a great job", "05:19", "keeping my body Ellie I think more than", "05:20", "anything what are you like when you are", "05:22", "in I know Robert Fellowes was your coach", "05:25", "for quite a long time and we both miss", "05:28", "him I'm sure you you were very close", "05:29", "with him he was such a great guy yeah", "05:31", "yeah was he the guy that like did he", "05:34", "sort of map out

tastic", "06:00", "fighter he with him he he was a smaller", "06:03", "heavyweight but he would fight jiying I", "06:05", "was like Peter arts and a dude that you", "06:07", "you gotta you know you look at him he's", "06:09", "only about 220 you know six foot one", "06:11", "maybe he's fighting six foot seven", "06:13", "300-pound guys so he has to be extra", "06:16", "technical in there and not rely on his", "06:18", "speed and power that's why I think he", "06:20", "makes such a great coach and and he", "06:22", "pushes me through it but I had another", "06:25", "guy I've been working with Corey Goodwin", "06:26", "for the last four or five years since", "06:28", "I've been on in Vegas he's kind of like", "06:30", "the mechanic you know he keeps me he", "06:31", "keeps my body fresh and

"15:45", "the survivor is like I mean that you", "15:48", "know new barbells a nice guy he really", "15:50", "is and you know I didn't want to hurt", "15:52", "him too bad it's two very similar fights", "15:54", "for him in a row to maulings that's in a", "15:57", "row that's you know when you're that guy", "15:59", "who wants to stand up and you know you", "16:01", "got guys that are just just constant", "16:03", "pressure constant pressure means that", "16:05", "people don't realize how much endurance", "16:07", "that takes to move away - moving", "16:08", "backwards it's a lot more difficult to", "16:10", "do yeah true I mean I feel like", "16:12", "everything kind of pushed you know it's", "16:15", "about who controls the pace of the fight", "16:16", "and I felt like I did a good job of that", "16:18", "and uh you know I thought even if I got", "16:20", "wobbled with it with the kick in the", "16:22", "third I still came back in you won that", "16:23", "round yeah I tried to make it a point to", "16:25", "finish that moment you went around you", "16:27", "know and you hurt him bad in the second", "16:30", "round - with a kick to the body let's", "16:32", "see him cover up and Tencent it but you", "16:34", "could see it it was a strong right kick", "16:36", "to the body one of the reporters he", "16:38", "asked me like why was i standing at at", "16:40", "range with him and it's just like I feel", "16:42", "like I can do it all you know and that's", "16:45", "my true sense like I can stand at range", "16:48", "with it with I mean he's definitely the", "16:49", "the most explosive dynamic", "16:51", "all those things you want to say the", "16:53", "best kicker in the lightweight division", "16:55", "and I and I can stand at range with them", "16:57", "and

"17:05", "not test myself um I'm not one of these", "17:07", "guys will shy away from shit he's an", "17:08", "interesting case because he's really", "17:10", "primarily a kicker he will throw punches", "17:12", "but that's not his strong suit I mean", "17:14", "he's not a guy that just wants to you", "17:16", "know just just dig in and throw bombs", "17:18", "yeah but he got some bombs hit me with", "17:22", "that left you know enough he hit me with", "17:24", "a monstrous left hook in the fifth Rossi", "17:26", "man he's still there the kitten that he", "17:29", "never gave up he was

we were you", "17:48", "shocked that they stopped it no I", "17:50", "thought it was the right call you know I", "17:52", "think more coaches and MMA should", "17:55", "definitely get in there a little bit", "17:57", "sooner and I think I think that's what", "17:59", "the some of our problem with his corner", "18:01", "was - you know you see some of these", "18:03", "fights and you can kind of tell when a", "18:05", "guy just doesn't you know it doesn't", "18:07", "make sense some make them take more", "18:08", "beats not right somebody like Barbosa is", "18:11", "explosive to the very very end you have", "18:13", "to give that to him that's the thing you", "18:14", "never know right me if he connected with", "18:16", "that left hook perfect and you went out", "18:17", "and then and

"speaking from because I'm not a coach", "18:34", "yet maybe you know my stance will change", "18:35", "when I'm when I am a coach but you know", "18:37", "or if I have a coach but we'll see yeah", "18:40", "it's uh it's it's different with I mean", "18:43", "the same thing with referees and Keith", "18:45", "Peterson did a great job in that fight", "18:47", "this is he's a guy that doesn't get", "18:48", "enough credit yeah there's a few like", "18:50", "you know herb Dean I think cuz John", "18:52", "McCarthy is retired I think he's the", "18:53", "gold standard Josh Rosenthal there's a", "18:55", "bunch of really good guys but that's a", "18:57", "tough call to decide when to stop I", "18:59", "think even Yamasaki you know yamasaki", "19:01", "takes a lot of uh he takes a lot of",

that I got", "20:35", "to play around with I think will keep", "20:37", "happening in the upcoming months", "20:38", "I didn't project that I would fight", "20:41", "again until July or so so a lot of the", "20:43", "things that I was doing diet waz was", "20:44", "kind of getting to that and they", "20:46", "approached me with this barbell as a", "20:47", "fight maybe like eight weeks earlier", "20:49", "than that so I just had to do it at to", "20:51", "do so is it a matter of just you didn't", "20:54", "taper off quick enough or you just came", "20:56", "in too heavy before you started you know", "20:58", "it was just it was just the timing wise", "20:59", "you know I missed it by one pound yeah", "21:01", "yeah it something on that time in that", "21:03", "I've really got to figure out and that", "21:05", "was the biggest problem with with the", "21:06", "Tony Ferguson fight you know I can break", "21:09", "it down for you so usually uh you know", "21:12", "I'm normally about 185 through six weeks", "21:14", "of diet I can usually die down to about", "21:16", "76 77 like that's where I'm and then", "21:20", "from there I start the water cut so the", "21:22", "week of the fight the Tuesday I'm 76 you", "21:26", "know I saved that all the way until you", "21:28", "know I overload my body with water and", "21:30", "you know cuz flush out some of the the", "21:32", "sodium and the carbs and all that", "21:35", "I saved the rest of that up until the", "21:37", "day before and I try and cut as much as", "21:39", "I can as because I wanted to spend as", "21:42", "little time dehydrated that dehydrated", "21:45", "as possible and I think that's some of", "21:47", "the problem with having these early", "21:48", "morning weigh-in is the time and issue", "21:50", "of it and as you wake up and then you", "21:53", "have to start from the time you wake up", "21:54", "rather than if it's at 4:00 o'clock in", "21:56", "the afternoon like it used to be you'd", "21:58", "be able to do it all throughout the day", "22:00", "yeah yeah I can cut more you know", "22:02", "reasonably through the morning you know", "22:04", "you can wait like if you had more time", "22:05", "you would have been able to make it oh", "22:07", "yeah absolutely 1% yeah time thing yes", "22:10", "yes I got confused when they were doing", "22:11", "this early morning winds I thought you", "22:13", "had like like from 8 a.m. to 4 o'clock", "22:16", "right right that's right yeah I thought", "22:18", "if you could weigh in early go ahead way", "22:19", "in early but they gave you the time yeah", "22:21", "I mean I'm not really I don't really", "22:25", "know the solution either you know I", "22:26", "don't think nobody really knows the", "22:27", "solution to that problem the the", "22:30", "timeframe because you are seeing a lot", "22:31", "of guys miss weight because of that and", "22:33", "I think that's that's one of the biggest", "22:34", "problems and not only that but guys are", "22:36", "going to sleep completely dehydrated and", "22:38", "sleeping through the night 20 pounds", "22:40", "dehydrated that's a lot of water coming", "22:42", "from your blood your blood gets thicker", "22:43", "your heart rate slows down when you when", "22:46", "you sleep I mean you know I try my best", "22:48", "not to spend as much time dehydrated his", "22:50", "partner so it's just a timing issue on", "22:52", "that last one especially when you see", "22:54", "guys like those on Joe's that just can't", "22:55", "do it anymore and he goes up to 70 he", "22:57", "looks better than ever what do you think", "22:59", "about that it's always an option for me", "23:02", "it would be an option now like I would I", "23:04", "would entertain the right fight at it", "23:06", "for sure", "23:06", "it's just right now at the state of it", "23:09", "is you know they're doing this bullshit", "23:10", "interim title and you know tyrants", "23:12", "sitting right there and it's it's a lot", "23:13", "of movement it's not a lot of movement", "23:14", "at the top right now so 155 just more", "23:17", "fights interests me it's bigger", "23:18", "challenges I think the guys are honestly", "23:20", "better at 155 170 maybe in a future but", "23:24", "you know it's got to be the right type", "23:25", "of fight or something", "23:26", "yeah they're well there's so many good", "23:27", "fighters now from I mean you go all", "23:29", "across the board I mean pretty much", "23:31", "every weight class that's strong now but", "23:33", "yeah I agree I think 55 is probably the", "23:35", "strongest weight loss right yeah and it", "23:36", "is so strong that you can make a 165 out", "23:39", "of me I don't I really don't see what", "23:40", "what the holdup is on it it was 65 to a", "23:43", "75 I grabbed because we have so many", "23:45", "guys that you know can bounce between", "23:47", "those and you'll have a whole new top 15", "23:50", "a whole new champion and to be just as", "23:52", "strong as any other two weight classes", "23:53", "next to it I couldn't agree more", "23:55", "I think it's very important that we", "23:57", "spread it out better I think ten pounds", "23:59", "is reasonable you know I mean the way", "24:02", "boxing has it they just thing you know", "24:03", "they have a 54 and then they have a 60", "24:05", "that seems a little ridiculous", "24:06", "they're 47 and then they have a 54 I", "24:08", "think you'd be better off with 10 just", "24:11", "said straight up", "24:12", "10 pounds that's reasonable but when you", "24:13", "go from like", "24:14", "85 to 205 that shit's crazy boy even 55", "24:21", "to 70 because most guys you know like a", "24:24", "normal-sized guy is about my son is one", "24:26", "hundred eighty-five hundred ninety", "24:27", "pounds that puts you in that in that", "24:29", "middle you know yeah guys like me with a", "24:31", "lot of muscle where I'm not gonna lose a", "24:33", "lot of fat in between you know right", "24:35", "even for this one I was 177 but I was", "24:38", "born and a half percent body fat you", "24:39", "know I couldn't really lean can't get", "24:42", "too much more lean than that sixth floor", "24:45", "and a half of somebody fight when you", "24:46", "weight in yeah before well I was four", "24:48", "and half percent maybe two weeks before", "24:50", "the fight Ashley what are you getting", "24:51", "calipers are you doing how they totally", "24:53", "testing over at the UM in the water not", "24:55", "over at the P I lost but anything yeah", "24:59", "they've got like so the scales aren't", "25:00", "that good yeah here's the thing about", "25:02", "those scales those scales when you hold", "25:04", "onto those things I mean some of them", "25:05", "are okay but the best way they say is", "25:08", "submerging you there's a submerge one", "25:10", "and there's another one that uses some", "25:12", "sort of like electricity thing like you", "25:14", "lie in a bed and I think that the", "25:16", "Performance Institute has that too", "25:18", "they're explaining that shit to me yeah", "25:20", "yeah the the full scanner yeah done that", "25:22", "a few times but it's much quicker much", "25:25", "easier just get on the scale and as long", "25:27", "as it's real low four and a half percent", "25:28", "sounds it does but as long as it's it's", "25:32", "still the same measurement you know an", "25:35", "obtained as my last fight for the Tony", "25:36", "fight I was five and a half percent on", "25:38", "so as long as it's in the same with the", "25:40", "same CalPERS yeah I mean what they're", "25:42", "using you know that you're basically on", "25:44", "point yeah exactly I can compare it at", "25:46", "least but again I can't get much that", "25:49", "much leaner you know it's mostly just", "25:50", "gonna come out water if they had a 65", "25:52", "then you know had I've got ten more", "25:54", "piles of water that I don't have to cut", "25:56", "out how fuckin ridiculous", "25:57", "how frustrating wasn't you for you going", "25:59", "into that Tony Ferguson fight with that", "26:00", "staph infection cuz that was a that was", "26:02", "serious for I didn't notice it at the", "26:04", "weigh-ins but then the moment you walked", "26:06", "into the cage it was funny man because", "26:09", "they were telling

like when you look at all the", "36:43", "skills that he has like that would be", "36:45", "better represented with some movement", "36:47", "and some footwork and some other things", "36:49", "yeah especially with a guy like Trevor", "36:51", "Whitman and this morning you know Trevor", "36:52", "is a great great coach which he did the", "36:55", "rose I mean yeah he spent eight there I", "36:57", "think their styles are very opposite uh", "37:00", "you know he should probably listen to", "37:02", "him a little bit more they see one of", "37:04", "the things with me and Robert faultless", "37:05", "you know I had them with brother Robert", "37:07", "was the the pretty much the only reason", "37:09", "why I moved to Vegas because he did", "37:14", "there's a there's a weird

but he just understood me", "37:27", "at", "37:28", "as an athlete a little bit more and even", "37:30", "some of the things that he would tell me", "37:31", "I wouldn't listen to it like he you know", "37:35", "he tried to tell me to stay smart and", "37:36", "you know not brought his eye at the end", "37:40", "of the day Joe I could I'm like fuck", "37:42", "this I'm a fight you know I'm a bite", "37:44", "down on my mouthpiece he tried to get me", "37:45", "to be smarter and just some of the", "37:48", "things that he would say to me resonated", "37:52", "with me more than anybody else so I", "37:54", "think now that he's gone I've put what", "37:58", "he said it's still in my head and it you", "38:02", "know I try and follow it even more now", "38:03", "you know you know and I wish somebody I", "38:07", "guess you wouldn't listen", "38:08", "because you know Whitman is telling him", "38:11", "right what to do the right thing to do", "38:12", "he should be probably listen to him well", "38:14", "I think Trevor just tries to complement", "38:16", "your style and gay G styles just savage", "38:19", "this is he's just going war we're going", "38:22", "to war every time one war", "38:24", "oh yes I get it yeah you know watch I", "38:28", "think you can I think you learn from", "38:30", "learning from somebody else you know I", "38:31", "think everybody has what they do that", "38:34", "that's like I say I and create a strong", "38:36", "team around me where everybody has what", "38:38", "they do and I'm just gonna try and", "38:40", "listen to him you know and even more so", "38:43", "now not that I understand that a little", "38:46", "bit more as I'm getting older and you", "38:47", "know going through life - with it I said", "38:50", "well Rob you know what one of the one of", "38:52", "the reporters there he asked me he was", "38:53", "like I said we seen you in there talking", "38:56", "and they thought I was talking about", "38:57", "Boza", "38:57", "but I was really just talking myself", "38:59", "like I was saying things that he would", "39:02", "say or Robert would say yeah that Robert", "39:06", "would say and I'm saying them to myself", "39:07", "and I guess my mouth was moving I don't", "39:10", "really know I thought it was in my head", "39:12", "the whole time but I guess like some of", "39:14", "the reporters could see it but you know", "39:16", "I really tried to make that a focus", "39:18", "interesting so do you do that in", "39:19", "sparring - yeah I don't I don't know I", "39:23", "usually try and did you realize you were", "39:25", "doing it until they brought it up I", "39:26", "didn't realize I no I'm not because he", "39:28", "when he asked me that it kind of caught", "39:29", "me off guard because I remember in the", "39:31", "fight I'm very cerebral III I remember", "39:34", "everything about it but I remember I was", "39:37", "gonna say something to Barbosa too you", "39:39", "know", "39:39", "talking my shit you know I'd do it if I", "39:41", "see something right on the time but I", "39:43", "didn't because he was a nice guy I", "39:44", "didn't realize that I was talking myself", "39:46", "to on it so you were just kind of going", "39:49", "through the things that you wanted to", "39:50", "focus on in the fight while I was hot", "39:52", "yeah I'm like stay do you know what", "39:54", "you're saying", "39:54", "even the kick the kick that heel and it", "39:56", "if you see like a microsecond before", "39:58", "that I was not in my head because I was", "40:00", "I was I took my mind off on for a split", "40:04", "second and I saw the knockout there I", "40:06", "seen him dip to his left and I'm like", "40:07", "next time he did so I'm I'm about to get", "40:10", "it so I started to talk to him and I was", "40:13", "like like I got this and I took my mind", "40:16", "off of him and he hit me with that", "40:18", "fucking spanking but what it should have", "40:20", "said was stay sharp yeah you know stay", "40:23", "is stay focused like that's what I was", "40:25", "saying in the fourth and the fifth round", "40:26", "after that kick landed I was like stay", "40:28", "sharp stay focused saying that to myself", "40:30", "because that's what Rob would tell me he", "40:32", "wouldn't tell me to you know look for", "40:33", "the knockout what was the thought", "40:35", "process when you're gonna face a guy", "40:37", "like Barbosa that such a dangerous", "40:38", "kicker was it a lot of faints plus", "40:40", "pressure like what was the thought", "40:41", "process about getting close to him yeah", "40:43", "with a guy like Barbosa he throws", "40:45", "everything so hard is so explosive I", "40:48", "knew I was gonna have to eat some of", "40:50", "that and just keep pushing forward and", "40:52", "just not take my eyes off of him even", "40:54", "when I got wobbled and I was wrong I", "40:55", "just try not take my eyes off of them", "40:57", "you know with with a with a guy like", "40:59", "that that's such a great athlete which", "41:02", "is what I considered Barbosa as you know", "41:04", "Rob had these three things he put", "41:06", "everybody in an athlete a competitor or", "41:08", "a fighter category and Barbosa was like", "41:10", "epitome of an athlete but with that you", "41:14", "can't show him no you can't show him", "41:16", "that he's doing good you know what I'm", "41:18", "saying mm-hmm so every time he was", "41:20", "throwing I'm just like walking it off", "41:22", "that fucking switch kick is ridiculous", "41:24", "he's got the most ridiculous bitch pick", "41:26", "in the game so Marc Telegraaf a who's", "41:30", "seen some of the best of the best fight", "41:32", "in Thailand in in real you know in life", "41:35", "and

fastest way dead tired I'm up beat", "41:46", "the hell out of a foot and still thought", "41:48", "I was like how is this even and", "41:51", "- even in the third and fourth round Wow", "41:53", "and some of it I'm kind of like looking", "41:55", "while I'm in there I'm like what is he", "41:56", "doing that can make him do that you know", "42:00", "I try and steal a little bit from every", "42:02", "guy that I fight especially like what is", "42:05", "he doing that's allowing him to be that", "42:07", "goddamn fast with it but you know I", "42:09", "prepare right I prepare with a lot

realize now oh those kids", "42:26", "can come at you that fast yeah yeah I", "42:28", "mean and you get that in a lot of", "42:30", "different ways like like with Tony you", "42:32", "know Tony had did a lot of things in", "42:33", "there that I didn't expect and I didn't", "42:37", "you know didn't really plan for there's", "42:39", "only so much planning that you can do", "42:41", "until you get in there and you need that", "42:43", "experience to rely back on and I feel", "42:45", "like that's what I'm building up at a", "42:46", "young age even it's possible for you", "42:48", "either rematch with Tony with Tony now", "42:51", "coming off of that very disappointing", "42:54", "fall you know when he was which is crazy", "42:57", "I feel bad for did you say something -", "42:59", "this is very important and I actually", "43:01", "have pictures - I'm gonna send him to", "43:02", "you right now Jamie so we could put it", "43:04", "online because everybody was repeating", "43:07", "the the thought that he had worn", "43:12", "sunglasses and that's why he fell down", "43:16", "that he was wearing Sunday yeah he", "43:21", "misspoke and he said it - I think he", "43:25", "said my prescription sunglasses to Ariel", "43:27", "Helwani I think that's what they were", "43:29", "saying the the square was that he wears", "43:31", "it I'll send it I'm gonna send it to",

does love Tony's a smart guy you know", "43:51", "I don't I don't hold that against time", "43:53", "it was probably something that was", "43:54", "already injured in his leg and I feel", "43:58", "bad for the guy I really do I don't", "43:59", "think he'll ever be the same coming back", "44:00", "off that oneness but that's a big", "44:03", "you know I hear detached it yeah text", "44:06", "him from it long yeah I mean that that's", "44:08", "huge especially at 34 to try and come", "44:10", "back off that that's it's gonna and it", "44:12", "kind of sucks for me too cuz I think I", "44:14", "fought the best Tony Ferguson that", "44:15", "you're gonna see period really you think", "44:19", "so because it was before that injury", "44:20", "yeah I don't think he's gonna be the", "44:22", "same again after it and he'll come back", "44:23", "and he'll still beat great guys you know", "44:25", "he's still he's still gonna do very good", "44:27", "but you know I don't think it'll be the", "44:29", "same and you know damn it I got this", "44:32", "photo in here somewhere I'm gonna find", "44:34", "it I can't find it", "44:35", "I'll send it to you later but in the", "44:38",

probably yeah but um it wasn't", "45:05", "he wasn't wearing sunglasses yeah I mean", "45:07", "I just want to clear it up for Tony like", "45:09", "I said I mean I feel bad for him I", "45:10", "really do I think you the good news is I", "45:12", "didn't come back from that injury that's", "45:14", "an injury you can come back at 34", "45:16", "especially with the way he trains I mean", "45:17", "I think he I think the body can come", "45:19", "back is just I don't know if his mind", "45:21", "will let him be as free if that was one", "45:24", "of Tony's biggest assets to the stylist", "45:26", "he was I mean he just does whatever the", "45:28", "fuck he wants you know and now when he", "45:30", "gets back in here is he gonna be", "45:31", "thinking about his knee even if that's", "45:32", "in the back of your mind it's still it's", "45:34", "it's limited on that type of style that", "45:36", "he that he likes to fight maybe or maybe", "45:39", "you just fucking his head right now you", "45:46", "never know it's the money to be made", "45:50", "well he will be out for quite a while I", "45:53", "would imagine he won't be able to even", "45:55", "really train hard for six months yeah at", "45:57", "least at least yeah he's at least a year", "45:58", "also uh you know what I'll let I me I", "46:02", "when I look at that and I see that fight", "46:04", "and just you know how much different", "46:07", "shit could be now you know had I went", "46:09", "into that fight healthy especially I", "46:11", "think the the entire division would look", "46:13", "different but I'm a correct all that and", "46:15", "a little", "46:15", "let me let me get my hands Oh could be", "46:16", "first well it's interesting me you're in", "46:19", "the running now for sure and before this", "46:21", "fight I think you were a slight underdog", "46:24", "in the barboza fight yeah but after that", "46:26", "domination I mean you you for sure moved", "46:29", "up and you're in the running now a", "46:32", "hundred percent so you got Poirier who", "46:34", "just looked real good against kg and won", "46:36", "that fight after getting his legs chewed", "46:37", "up

good he was a champion yeah yeah", "90:19", "for Korea but I mean he's just super", "90:22", "underrated especially his kicking oh", "90:24", "yeah but prepare for that fight I had to", "90:28", "work with a lot of Taekwondo guys and", "90:29", "right off the back I'm like oh this is a", "90:31", "different style like it's it's like four", "90:34", "different four or five different styles", "90:35", "of kicking I think theirs is like wanted", "90:39", "a better mixes of speed and power and", "90:42", "non telegraphic and I try to blend that", "90:44", "a little bit more with Muay Thai yeah", "90:46", "and find the best style wow I feel like", "90:49", "Muay Thai is absolutely the best but", "90:51", "there's some shit that those Taekwondo", "90:53", "guys can do that'll catch you off guard", "90:54", "and if you know those other things you", "90:57", "can do those things yeah one person like", "90:59", "the wheel kicks it and that's what you", "91:01", "see with that yeah I mean that the Thai", "91:03", "style has that probably the hardest", "91:05", "kicks and the most technical from it but", "91:08", "you know you can kind of see some of", "91:10", "them coming you know you can see unless", "91:12", "you got a freak speed like like Barbosa", "91:15", "you know but actually technical wise you", "91:19", "know you can kind of see you coming a", "91:20", "little bit more he was a tire is more", "91:22", "effective because it's just more", "91:23", "effective this chopping the legs", "91:25", "it's just brutally effective and", "91:27", "obviously in Taekwondo there's none of", "91:28", "that yeah so those guys wouldn't if if", "91:31", "you were seen like matches we're talking", "91:32", "with no guys fight Muay Thai guys they", "91:34", "get affiliated yeah you know rated for", "91:36", "sure if you allow the Muay Thai guy to", "91:39", "kick the legs the Taekwondo guys just", "91:40", "really don't know what to do yeah it's", "91:42", "good once they learn it then they have", "91:44", "the Taekwondo too but it's a matter of", "91:46", "whether or not like we were talking", "91:47", "about before like if you're a wrestler", "91:48", "do you

it's just", "119:57", "groups of people get real tribal and", "120:00", "then you know the fucking Yankees hate", "120:02", "the Red Sox and this is just how it goes", "120:04", "and these people just

objective", "120:49", "thing in my in my opinion yeah but it's", "120:51", "so natural though let you say this is", "120:53", "it's almost like communities mm-hmm", "120:55", "you know is if you have your your your", "120:58", "thoughts I've got my thoughts and we are", "121:00", "part of two separate communities right", "121:02", "and it's just like what anything else I", "121:04", "think that

understand", "121:37", "that it's like I said just to go back to", "121:39", "my child it is just that's the way I", "121:42", "grew up and that's what I understood but", "121:44", "when I look at

genetically and", "122:25", "we very but we very more by our", "122:26", "environment how much love we get yeah", "122:28", "yeah that that's it that's a big part of", "122:30", "is like it's just the culture yeah it's", "122:32", "just you know and and I think it stems", "122:35", "from one culture being separated from", "122:39", "others and not having that integration", "122:42", "yeah then you get that like even more of", "122:44", "a disconnect and then once you did", "122:46", "even bigger than you know is it's all", "122:48", "like a now he'll more insecurity which", "122:50", "leads to more tribalism and it's the", "122:52", "whole thing is just it's so", "122:54", "disappointing that people still operate", "122:56", "like this but I think people are opening", "122:57", "up to that more now than before I just", "122:59", "think it's a slow process yeah slowly", "123:01", "but surely yeah sure that we still", "123:03", "working at it yeah I mean look you know", "123:05", "we were
