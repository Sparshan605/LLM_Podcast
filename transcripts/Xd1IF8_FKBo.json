"62:21", "oh so you could charge it with different", "62:23", "ones of the superchargers one pending on", "62:25", "to increase the versatility of it you", "62:28", "had a supercharged of fast charge", "62:30", "compatibility and then you had the more", "62:32", "widely distributed municipal format", "62:34", "charger and then there's just two", "62:36", "different pigtail adapters you can

the air yes", "65:44", "technically charged particles as the", "65:47", "technology improved that 15 miles an", "65:49", "hour could be a real speed yeah Wow yeah", "65:53", "and in that scene guy I saw him once at", "65:57", "a trade show and I was exhibiting at the", "65:59", "show as well says there on setup day as", "66:01", "bored out of my gourd we were I was", "66:03", "already set up on the Ford booth so just", "66:05", "walking around sort of sniffing around", "66:07", "and see this trippy scientist guy in his", "66:10", "lab coat and this shitty little booth it", "66:12", "was like you know six by ten foot booth", "66:14", "and he", "66:14", "a show where people have like 200 by", "66:16", "60-foot boom he's got this odd little", "66:19", "toroidal thing and then a bigger", "66:21", "toroidal thing and literally like a", "66:23", "chalkboard it's like dude what's going", "66:25", "on so I start talking about he starts", "66:27", "explaining the technology and what he", "66:29", "was doing and like the smaller went at", "66:31", "300 foot-pounds of torque the larger one", "66:33", "had two thousand and he was looking to", "66:36", "develop it for rail cars for semis for", "66:39", "cars like an on and on and on he's like", "66:42", "yeah the biggest problem is stopping it", "66:43", "once it gets going because the toroidal", "66:46", "structure meant that the compression", "66:47", "cycle from you know 12 to 2 of that", "66:50", "first cylinder was such that when the", "66:52", "combustion occurred and it propelled the", "66:55", "next piston into the next combustion", "66:57", "cycle and kept going so getting that", "66:59", "power out of a central crank was a", "67:01", "challenge and then how to stop the damn", "67:03", "thing was like the bigger challenge but", "67:05", "they'd run on like horse piss ionic", "67:09", "charge particles diesel gas like didn't", "67:13", "even need spark plugs so I'm like blown", "67:15", "away by this I go back the next day", "67:17", "where do you go", "67:19", "booth gone empty done and I had the", "67:22", "guy's info I try to reach out to him", "67:24", "website go on the website I had looked", "67:26",

"67:38", "like yeah never again because they", "67:40", "bought it and they shelved it I'm never", "67:42", "selling anything again fuck them", "67:44", "I'm licensing to specific channels of", "67:46", "applications and that's it his new", "67:48", "product so what do you think happen if", "67:51", "you're a conspiracy theorist do you", "67:52", "think someone bought him out and just oh", "67:54", "I'm not I'm a small independent business", "67:57", "owner real realist in that hell yes", "67:59", "someone didn't like that and they", "68:01", "shelved that shit so they bought it and", "68:02", "then just shelled it yep so his next", "68:05", "product did that yeah I don't know and", "68:09", "he was very cagey about it then he had", "68:12", "another product where you would replace", "68:14", "the alternator in your car with a", "68:16", "generator and you had a small battery in", "68:19", "the vehicle right so this is a retrofit", "68:21", "system the retail model was brilliant", "68:25", "because you'd have like a pretty cheesy", "68:27", "and expensive", "68:28", "three axes mil a shit-ton and CAD files", "68:31", "and one product on the shelf so in a", "68:34", "lightweight car it was like an electric", "68:36", "super charger so you'd replace your", "68:38", "alternator and it had a toothed cog and", "68:40", "for the pulley and then your crank", "68:42",

assists and", "69:09", "range increase in did great things for", "69:12", "mpg and then the story I got on that one", "69:15", "was BMW put him under a big contract for", "69:18", "it to license it and use it and then the", "69:20", "guy disappeared off the face planet", "69:22", "again Jesus Christ this guy shit happens", "69:25", "do you remember there was a video that", "69:27", "was circulating many years ago about a", "69:30", "guy who created a car to run on air mmm", "69:33", "no excuse me water created a car that", "69:36", "runs on water and then this car that ran", "69:38",
