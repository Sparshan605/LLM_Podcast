level I", "05:54", "wouldn't even let the individual states", "05:56", "decide whether or not they want legal", "05:59", "marijuana so in other words he would", "06:00", "prosecute the states like Colorado and", "06:02", "California that have legal marijuana", "06:03", "using federal law and right there he", "06:06", "softened his position slightly and he", "06:07", "said well leave it up to the states and", "06:09", "let them decide so do you think that's", "06:11", "because he knows he'll never be", "06:12", "President no I think he still wants to", "06:14", "be President there's no

point not his point", "08:22", "yes because that's when the Mafia got", "08:24", "incredibly powerful because you pushed", "08:26", "all the alcohol sales underground and", "08:28", "they got all the power and the money as", "08:29", "a result of it and that's when crime has", "08:31", "shot through the roof so if you want to", "08:33", "decrease violent crime and the drug war", "08:35", "yeah one

but see it's not crazy on the", "09:10", "technical side it's like it's crazy", "09:11", "engineered it's obvious it's programmed", "09:13", "but it's crazy to watch like wow there's", "09:16", "something the the reason the moment was", "09:17", "transformative is I know exactly how it", "09:19", "works and yet by watching it something", "09:21", "about the feeling of it you're like this", "09:24", "thing is alive hmm and there was this", "09:27", "terrifying moment not terrifying with", "09:30", "terrifying and appealing", "09:31", "where this is the future right like this", "09:35", "thing like this thing represents some", "09:39", "future that is totally that we don't", "09:44", "cannot understand just like a future in", "09:47", "the 18th century of future with planes", "09:50", "and smartphones was something who could", "09:52", "understand that this thing that little", "09:55", "dog could have had a human consciousness", "09:58", "in it that was the feeling I had and I", "10:01", "don't know exactly how it works has", "10:02", "nothing close to the intelligence but it", "10:04", "just gives you this picture of what the", "10:08", "possibilities are of these living", "10:09", "creatures and I think that's what people", "10:11", "feel when they see basta dynamics look", "10:13", "all awesome this thing running around is", "10:15", "they don't care about

and can evolve and", "10:27", "learn so quickly exponentially fast is", "10:31", "this terrifying frontier that that", "10:35", "really makes us think as it did for me", "10:39", "I'm sure a bull rider would look at free", "10:40", "soloing and be like what a crazy dude", "10:42", "you know everybody looks at another", "10:43", "sport that's great and honestly I look", "10:45", "at fighting

with that guy that's", "11:20", "just got flatlined and you're like whoa", "11:23", "that could have been made how much the", "11:25", "fighters like hold back you know because", "11:28", "I feel like you kind of have to like go", "11:29", "to the death but then if you actually", "11:30", "like punch somebody so hard they died or", "11:32", "something I mean obviously you'd feel", "11:33", "horrible right well you don't look back", "11:35", "at all with that so I'm saying but so", "11:37", "it's like you don't hold back at all but", "11:39", "then if you actually killed somebody",

possible", "11:48", "yes and it has happened and it's sort of", "11:51", "like it has happened very very rarely in", "11:55", "mixed martial arts never in the UFC but", "11:57", "in boxing it happens more often and with", "11:59", "one of the reasons why it happens more", "12:01", "often in boxing because you're only", "12:02", "punching in MMA you're taking people", "12:05", "down yeah people are
