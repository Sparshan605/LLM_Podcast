he", "06:09", "doesn't but but you see the kind of", "06:10", "guy's gonna want to report to vegans and", "06:12", "get them banned from Twitter where's he", "06:13", "gonna want to make fun of them they're", "06:15", "gonna target him try and get him removed", "06:17", "by exploiting the system that you guys", "06:18", "have", "06:19", "it may not be him though it could also", "06:20", "be his

some under someone's control", "06:29", "they could even even be other carnivore", "06:32", "diet proponents who are just jerks that", "06:35", "don't like him because he's getting all", "06:36", "the love people are weird yeah but it's", "06:38", "his sir", "06:39", "the idea though is that it it does kind", "06:41", "of highlight a bit of a flaw in that", "06:43", "it's good that someone can look as you", "06:45", "might see something awful someone daxing", "06:48", "someone or something like that and then", "06:49", "you can take that and report it and then", "06:51", "people can see it and

threat to your health", "07:01", "and if it is is what is Twitter's", "07:04", "responsibility in controlling that", "07:06", "information right so just to clarify my", "07:08", "my opinion is if you want to be a", "07:11", "proponent for the carnivore diet let", "07:12", "them but you've got people on YouTube", "07:14", "who are being D ranked for certain", "07:15", "beliefs about certain health issues that", "07:17", "I don't agree with and so one of the", "07:19", "risks then is you know we're coming", "07:21", "towards a position where people think", "07:23", "some ideas are better than others", "07:24", "therefore as a company we're going to", "07:26", "restrict access to certain information", "07:27", "you mean like anti vaccine so so I guess", "07:31", "I'm trying to say is at what would you", "07:33", "guys restrict someone from sharing in", "07:35", "fact false information about vaccines", "07:37", "that could get someone hurt that is not", "07:40", "a violation of Twitter's rules no I", "07:42", "think hmm I mean I'd be interested to", "07:45", "hear your ideas around this but our our", "07:47", "perspective right now is around this", "07:50", "concept of variety perspective like are", "07:52", "we are we encouraging more echo chambers", "07:55", "and filter bubbles or we at least", "07:57", "showing people other information that", "08:00", "might be counter to what they see and", "08:01", "there's there's a bunch of research that", "08:03", "would suggest that further emboldened", "08:05", "reviews there's also research that would", "08:06", "suggest that it at least gives up a", "08:09", "consideration about what their what they", "08:11", "currently believe so well you guys know", "08:13", "I sorry given the dynamics of our", "08:15", "network being completely public we're", "08:17", "not organized around communities we're", "08:18", "not organized around topics we have a", "08:22", "little bit more freedom to show more of", "08:25", "the spectrum of any one particular issue", "08:27", "and I think that's how we would we would", "08:30", "approach it from the start that said we", "08:34", "haven't really dealt much with", "08:36", "misinformation more broadly across like", "08:38", "these sorts of topics we've we've", "08:40", "focused our efforts on elections and", "08:44", "well mainly elections right now yeah", "08:47", "YouTube is a different animal you know", "08:48", "someone can really convince you that the", "08:51", "earth is flat if you're gullible and", "08:52", "watch a 45-minute YouTube video right", "08:54", "you know it's kind of a different thing", "08:56", "but I want I wanted to just kind of get", "08:58", "into that statement you made about", "08:59", "misinformation and whether or not you'll", "09:01", "police it so I I think that the tough", "09:03", "part of this is really and love to have", "09:05", "a discussion about this is do you really", "09:07", "want corporations to police what's true", "09:09", "and not true absolutely no that's a", "09:11", "really really tough position what you", "09:12", "guys do that we try not to do that we", "09:14", "don't want to do that when your rules", "09:16", "but the places that we focus on is where", "09:19", "we think that people are going to be", "09:20", "harmed by this in a direct and tangible", "09:22", "way that we feel a responsibility to", "09:25", "correct your rules Tim what you mean by", "09:28", "that naming a misgendering dead naming", "09:30", "and misgender that's a specific ideology", "09:32", "that's unique to a very small faction of", "09:34", "people in this world that you guys", "09:35", "actually ban people for so the way I", "09:38", "think of it is it's behavior based and I", "09:40", "know you think of it as content and we", "09:42", "can we can disagree on this point but", "09:44", "this is about why are you doing this to", "09:46", "a trans person why are you calling them", "09:48", "by this name when they've chosen to go", "09:49", "by a different name or why are you", "09:51", "adding them in some way like what is", "09:53", "your intent and purpose behind that I", "09:55", "mean interrupt but in the interest of", "09:57", "clarity I want to explain what dead", "10:00", "naming means right so well that so a", "10:03", "transgender individual changes their", "10:05", "name when they transition a dead name", "10:07", "would be their birth name or the name", "10:08", "they went by before the transition so", "10:10", "yes my mom is probably going what and an", "10:13", "end of the text what's a dead name and I", "10:15", "will clarify to your rule specifically", "10:16", "targeted misgendering and dead naming I", "10:19", "believe is correct right so years ago we", "10:21", "we passed a policy that we call our", "10:23", "hateful conduct policy and that", "10:24", "prohibits targeting or attacking someone", "10:26", "based on their belonging and any number", "10:29", "of groups whether it's because of their", "10:30", "religion or their race or their gender", "10:32", "their sexual orientation and their", "10:34", "gender identity so it was something", "10:36", "that's broad based is that you you can't", "10:38", "choose to attack people because of these", "10:40", "characteristics but you do have limits", "10:42", "on what characteristics you police right", "10:43", "so you're not you're not banning people", "10:45", "for targeted trans-species others right", "10:48", "well we we have also general abuse and", "10:50", "harassment rules right which says you", "10:51", "can't engage in abuse and harassment on", "10:53", "the plot okay but you can't detonate", "10:55", "someone but you can call them stupid", "10:57", "generally I mean if you created an", "10:59", "account that only was there to call the", "11:03", "same person stupid five thousand times", "11:05", "we'd probably view", "11:06", "as a you know targeted harass targeted", "11:08", "harassment it's a functional it's a", "11:11", "functional behavior like because people", "11:12", "with our system can do this in a massive", "11:15", "velocity so it's ultimately silent you", "11:17", "from a platformer just say like I give", "11:19", "up I don't want to deal with this thing", "11:20", "I'm out", "11:21", "so we can just get into all of the big", "11:25", "examples I mean starting with to Tim but", "11:28", "can we just take a step back and try to", "11:30", "level set what we're trying to do with", "11:31", "our model Seashore I think it's worth", "11:33", "yes yes so as a as a high level I", "11:36", "personally and this is my job to run the", "11:39", "policy team I believe that everyone has", "11:41", "a voice and should be able to use it and", "11:42", "I want them to be able to use it online", "11:44", "now where we draw a line is when people", "11:48", "use their voice and use their platform", "11:49", "to abuse and harass other people to", "11:52", "silence them because I think that that's", "11:54", "what we've seen over the years is a", "11:55", "number of people who have been silenced", "11:58", "online because of the abuse and", "11:59", "harassment they've received and they", "12:00", "either stop talking or they leave the", "12:02", "platform in its entirety if you look at", "12:04", "free expression and free speech laws", "12:05", "around the world they're not absolutely", "12:07", "they're not absolutely there's always", "12:09", "limitations on what you can say and it's", "12:11", "when you're starting to endanger other", "12:12", "people so so my question then is when I", "12:15", "was physically threatened on Twitter you", "12:17", "guys refuse to take down the tweet and I", "12:19", "showed up in Berkeley and someone", "12:20", "physically threatened me because they", "12:21", "were encouraged to when I was in", "12:23", "Venezuela I was physically threatened by", "12:25", "high-profile individual 10,000 people", "12:26", "tweeting at me you guys do nothing right", "12:28", "so I guess there's the obvious question", "12:31", "of why does it always feel like your", "12:32", "policies are going one direction", "12:33", "politically you say it's about behavior", "12:35", "you said several times already but I've", "12:37", "already I've got tons of examples of", "12:38", "that not being the case and you will", "12:40", "always be able to find those examples", "12:42", "examples where you guys were alerted", "12:44", "multiple times and did nothing", "12:46", "like when anti-fat a bunch of law", "12:48", "enforcement agents some of the tweets", "12:50", "were removed but since September this", "12:52", "tweet is still live with a list of", "12:54", "private phone numbers addresses yet", "12:56", "Kathy Griffin she's fine the guy who", "12:59", "threatened the lives of these kids in", "13:01", "Covington and said lock him in the", "13:02", "school and burn it down you did nothing", "13:03", "I mean he got suspended I'd take his", "13:05", "tweets down was he banned for", "13:07", "threatening the lives of kids absolutely", "13:08", "not", "13:09", "so again we have and I'm I'm happy to", "13:11", "talk about all these details we have our", "13:14", "policies that are meant to protect", "13:15", "people and they're meant to enable for", "13:17", "expression as long as you're not trying", "13:19", "to sign", "13:19", "somebody else now we take a variety of", "13:22", "different enforcement mechanisms around", "13:23", "that sometimes you get warned sometimes", "13:25", "we're your tweet is forced to be deleted", "13:27", "it's a very rare occasion where we will", "13:30", "outright suspend someone without any", "13:31", "sort of warning or any sort of ability", "13:35", "to understand what happened what did you", "13:36", "guys do with Kathy Griffin when she was", "13:38", "saying she wanted the names of those", "13:39", "young kids we're in the mag hats at the", "13:42", "Covington high school camps that's right", "13:43", "it's a great example Joe so in that", "13:45", "particular case you know our doxxing", "13:47", "policy really focuses on posting private", "13:50", "information which we don't consider", "13:51", "names to be private we consider your", "13:53", "home address your home from your home", "13:55", "phone number your mobile phone number", "13:56", "those types of things to be private so", "13:59", "in that particular case we took what I", "14:00", "think now is probably a very literal", "14:02", "interpretation of our policy and so that", "14:04", "that was not a daxing incident do you", "14:07", "think that was an error I think that it", "14:08", "was short-sighted and given the context", "14:10", "of what was going on there that if I was", "14:13", "doing this all over again I would", "14:15", "probably ask my team to look at that", "14:16", "through the lens of what was the purpose", "14:18", "behind that tweet and if the purpose was", "14:20", "in fact to identify these kids to either", "14:22", "doxa them or abusing harass them which", "14:24", "it probably was then we should be taking", "14:26", "a more expansive view of that policy and", "14:29", "including that type of content", "14:30", "especially considering the fact they're", "14:31", "minors I would think that right away", "14:33", "that would violate the approach so this", "14:36", "is a trial and error sort of learn and", "14:38", "and move on with new information sort of", "14:40", "a deal absolutely we're gonna learn", "14:42", "we're gonna make a ton of mistakes we're", "14:43", "trying to do this with hundreds of", "14:45", "millions of accounts all around the", "14:47", "world numerous languages we're gonna", "14:49", "make mistakes even if we get better", "14:51", "there will always be mistakes but we're", "14:53", "hoping to learn from those and to make", "14:55", "ourselves better and to catch cases like", "14:57",

was the details of Milo", "21:19", "so Milo had a number of tweets that", "21:23", "violated our rules going back to 2014", "21:25", "but I'm going to talk about the final", "21:26", "three in this research concept he", "21:30", "claimed to be a BuzzFeed reporter in his", "21:32", "bio and he's a verified account so that", "21:35", "is impersonation I'm not sure why he did", "21:37", "that he did do that", "21:38", "well BuzzFeed's a left-wing thing so he", "21:41", "was doing parody potentially but our", "21:43", "parody rules are very specific that if", "21:44", "you have an account that's me being as a", "21:47", "parody account you need to say that it", "21:48", "is a parody account right people", "21:50", "everybody who knows Milo would know that", "21:52", "he's not a

or a certification so the viable", "22:04", "via the verification was removed because", "22:07", "of the BuzzFeed thing I believe so I can", "22:09", "confirm that I believe so he also docked", "22:12", "someone he posted private information", "22:15", "about an individual so that was the", "22:17", "second one mm-hmm he tweeted to somebody", "22:20", "else if you were my child I'd have", "22:23", "dashed her head on a rock and tried", "22:24", "again which we viewed as a threat really", "22:28", "mm-hmm that seems like he's saying like", "22:32", "your mom should have swallowed you you", "22:34", "know it's like you know I'm saying he's", "22:36", "like you're a mistake that's a threat I", "22:39", "understand what reasonable people would", "22:41", "have different impressions this I'm just", "22:43", "going through and telling you what they", "22:44", "are just really have all the facts", "22:46", "debate them and then the last one we", "22:49", "found a bunch of things that he posted", "22:51", "that we viewed as incitement of abuse", "22:54", "against Leslie Jones so there's a bunch", "22:56", "of them but the one that I like to look", "22:59", "at which really convinced me is he", "23:01", "posted two doctored tweets that were", "23:03", "supposedly by Leslie Jones they were", "23:05", "fake tweets the first one said white", "23:08", "people are getting on

nude better pay up so this was", "23:26", "just a fake tweet that someone had", "23:27", "photoshopped to fake tweets and we know", "23:31", "they were faked because we could still", "23:32", "tell from the software and then they", "23:35", "were faked is you can't always tell so", "23:37", "it is it is possible that he didn't know", "23:40", "they were faked it's possible someone", "23:42",

bunch", "23:59", "of other things he was saying towards", "24:01", "Leslie Jones on Twitter I and my team", "24:04", "felt that this was taken as a whole", "24:07", "incitement of harassment against her", "24:09", "wasn't there another issue with multiple", "24:11", "accounts that were connected to him", "24:14", "there were a bunch of other issues on", "24:17", "the background but these are the three", "24:18", "primary things that we looked at in", "24:21", "terms of the other things that were in", "24:22", "the background", "24:23", "with a multiple accounts that were", "24:26", "connected to him like I think that I'm", "24:29", "not sure about that Joe", "24:30", "I think it was more that we found him to", "24:33", "be engaging in coordinated behavior and", "24:35", "inciting people to to attack Leslie", "24:38", "Jones now with a case with like him no", "24:40", "I'm just gonna be honest what I'm", "24:42", "listening to those or listening to read", "24:44", "those tweets out they don't sound that", "24:46", "bad and they certainly don't sound as", "24:47", "bad as calling for the death of a child", "24:49", "was wearing a maggot hat throw him into", "24:51", "a wood chipper the fact that that guy", "24:52", "still out there", "24:53", "tweeting and yet Milo's not Milo's", "24:56", "initial the whole thing stemmed from", "24:59", "other than the BuzzFeed thing stemmed", "25:01", "from his legitimate criticism of a film", "25:04", "and he's you know he's a satirist he was", "25:07", "mocking this film the daxing incident", "25:09", "wasn't related why don't we we all agree", "25:14", "that daxing is something that should", "25:16", "take action hundred percent Retton", "25:18", "people in real life and i take an", "25:20", "enormous amount of responsibility for", "25:23", "that because I fear Daly for the things", "25:25", "that are happening on the platform that", "25:26", "are translating into the real world so", "25:29", "Milo is a contentious figure and there's", "25:32", "certainly things you can pull up that I", "25:33", "wouldn't agree with anything he did", "25:34", "there I think those are horrible I think", "25:36", "Joe brought some really good points but", "25:37", "what about Chuck Johnson why was Chuck", "25:40", "Johnson banned I don't have those", "25:42", "details in front of me Chuck Johnson", "25:44", "said that he was preparing something to", "25:46", "take out DeRay McKesson and in the", "25:48", "journalistic context people take this to", "25:50", "mean he was going to do a dossier or", "25:52", "some kind of hit piece under a his", "25:53", "permanently banned and my understanding", "25:55", "and it's been a long time since I've", "25:56", "read this there was some leaked emails I", "25:58", "think from Dick Costolo where he said", "26:00", "maybe it wasn't Dec I want a dragged", "26:01", "dick I don't know who it was exactly", "26:02", "they said I don't care just get rid of", "26:03", "him and he was off so you have and again", "26:07", "maybe there's some hidden context there", "26:09", "I don't know but on the surface the", "26:10", "concern is that this is always leaning", "26:13", "towards the left oh it absolutely is and", "26:16", "I'm I'm not even getting started yeah I", "26:18", "can understand why you feel that way I", "26:21", "don't think that's true I think we look", "26:22", "at each individual instance of", "26:24", "violations or our rules and try to make", "26:26", "the best case that we can well not", "26:28", "trying and I do think Jo just to just to", "26:30", "say I do think we've failed in a couple", "26:33", "of ways and I want to admit that", "26:34", "number one we haven't done enough", "26:36", "education about what it rules are", "26:38", "because a lot of people violate our", "26:39", "rules and they don't even know it like", "26:40", "some of the statistics that we've looked", "26:42", "at like for a lot of first-time users of", "26:44", "the platform if they violate the rule", "26:46", "once almost two-thirds of them never", "26:47", "violate the rules again so we're not", "26:49", "talking about like a bunch of people", "26:51", "accidentally

my rights to post exactly and", "27:00", "they're able to do it so we have a lot", "27:02", "of work to do on education so people", "27:03", "really understand what the rules are in", "27:05", "the first place the other thing we have", "27:07", "to do to address these allegations that", "27:09", "we're doing this from a biased", "27:10", "perspective is to be really clear about", "27:13", "what types of behavior are caught by our", "27:16", "rules and what types are not and to be", "27:17", "transparent within the product so when a", "27:19", "particular tweet is found to be in", "27:21", "violation of our rules being very very", "27:23", "clear like this tweet was found to be in", "27:25", "violation of this particular rule and", "27:27", "that's all work that we're doing is we", "27:28", "think the combination of Education and", "27:30", "transparency is really important", "27:31", "particularly for an open platform like", "27:33", "Twitter it's just part of who we are and", "27:36", "we have to build it into the product I", "27:37", "appreciate that your particular thoughts", "27:39", "though on those examples that he", "27:41", "described when he talking about", "27:42", "someone saying he should throw these", "27:44", "children into a wood chipper versus", "27:46", "Chuck Johnson saying he should take this", "27:49", "guy he wants to prepare a dossier to",

"27:57", "like that I can't preparing I know I can", "27:59", "understand it could be misconstrued as", "28:01", "he was trying to assassinate him right", "28:03", "could you could misconstrue with that", "28:04", "but not a direct but the other ones a", "28:06", "direct threat one guy is banned for life", "28:08", "the other guy is still post and we can", "28:10", "I'm happy to follow up I just don't have", "28:12", "all the Chuck Johnson it's not about one", "28:13", "thing is it it's about a pattern and", "28:15", "practice of violating rules and we we", "28:18", "don't want to kick someone off for one", "28:19", "thing but if there's a pattern in", "28:20", "practice like there was from Milo we are", "28:22", "gonna have to take action at some point", "28:24", "because we can't sit back and let people", "28:26", "be abused and harassed and silenced on", "28:28", "the problem well so so one really", "28:30", "important thing that needs to be stated", "28:31", "is that Twitter by definition is a", "28:33", "biased platform in favor of the left", "28:35", "period it's not it's not a question I", "28:36", "understand you might have your own", "28:37", "interpretation but it's

that's a", "28:59", "radical example though I mean what he's", "29:01", "talking about I mean in terms of", "29:03", "generalities that in general things lean", "29:06", "far more left would you agree that I", "29:08", "don't know what that means but in this", "29:09", "particular case it's how the speech is", "29:11", "being used that this is a new vector of", "29:13", "attack that people have

covering a", "29:38", "story in Berkeley and someone said if", "29:40", "you see him attack him like it was it", "29:43", "was I'm paraphrasing they said basically", "29:45", "to swing at me take my stuff steal from", "29:47", "me and Twitter told me after review was", "29:50", "not a violation of their policy somebody", "29:52", "made an allusion to me being a", "29:54", "homosexual and I reported that instantly", "29:57", "gone so when I show so so for me I'm", "29:59", "looking I'm like well of course of", "30:00", "course Twitter is going to enforce the", "30:02", "social justice

disagree with", "42:26", "it but I just want to make sure it's", "42:28", "clear to everybody who's listening my", "42:29", "point is simply that you know ben", "42:31", "shapiro went on a talk show and", "42:32", "absolutely refused and that's his shake", "42:35", "you know and he's one of the biggest", "42:36", "podcasts in in the world so if you have", "42:39", "all of his millions upon

it's always just explaining", "43:13", "the why behind a lot of our policy", "43:15", "reasons I I would agree and I think it's", "43:17", "fine you did research and you found this", "43:19", "to be

"trying to make is it's it's simply", "43:28", "whether you believe it but whether you", "43:30", "justified or not is not the point the", "43:31", "point is you do you do have this rule", "43:33",

"43:41", "behind these things the why is to", "43:43", "protect people from abuse and harassment", "43:45", "on our pot I understand but you", "43:47", "essentially created a protected class if",

they're you know so", "134:27", "and I should point out that they decided", "134:29", "to call for violence based on and Tifa", "134:31", "calling for violence yeah based on", "134:34", "antifa", "134:35", "actually actively committing violence", "134:36", "against conservative people that were", "134:38", "there to see different people well it", "134:39", "partly started because in Berkeley

there's a video of some", "134:48", "guy in all black cracking someone on the", "134:50", "back was on the ground looking what", "134:52", "their unconscious so these conservatives", "134:54", "see this and they decide to hold a rally", "134:56", "saying we won't back down they hold a", "134:57", "rally in Berkeley and then anti-fur", "135:00", "shows up again I understand you can't", "135:01",

they", "135:10", "called it this a guy shows up in armor", "135:11", "with a stick and he starts swinging back", "135:12", "and now you have two factions forming so", "135:15", "while I recognize it's

you", "135:24", "look at an taifa and there's different", "135:25", "cells of varying size and their", "135:27", "different accounts so I have to to like", "135:30", "I guess the argument I could make is if", "135:32", "you're gonna ban the proud boys by all", "135:33", "means under your justification but if", "135:36", "you look at a specific channel that's", "135:37", "got twenty thousand

of violence yeah", "135:46", "absolutely", "135:48", "so I guess the question is how come they", "135:50", "don't get removed well in the past when", "135:53", "we've looked at an TiVo we it's we ran", "135:55", "into this decentralization issue which", "135:57", "is we weren't able to find the same type", "135:59", "of information that we were able to find", "136:00", "about Bravo's which was

with you know he's abandoned", "136:25", "that he's not only that he's", "136:26", "disassociated himself with it and said", "136:28", "that it completely got out of hand he", "136:30", "doesn't wanna have anything to do with", "136:31", "it yeah and I think this is a great", "136:32", "again test case for how we think about", "136:34", "getting people back on the platform if", "136:37", "he's an interesting case because he's a", "136:39", "really a provocateur and he fancies", "136:42", "himself you know sort of a punk rocker", "136:44", "and he just he likes stirring shit I", "136:46", "mean when he came on my show last time", "136:48", "he was on he was dressed up like Michael", "136:51", "Douglas and falling down you know he did", "136:54", "it on purpose he brought a briefcase and", "136:55", "everything I'm like what are you doing", "136:56", "it's like I'm Michael Douglas I'm", "136:57", "falling down like he's he's showman in", "137:01", "many ways and he did not mean for this", "137:04", "to go the way it went he thought it", "137:07", "would be this sort of innocent fun thing", "137:10", "to be a part of and then other people", "137:11", "got involved in it and when people call", "137:14", "for violence the problem is they think", "137:17", "that you know you're gonna just hit", "137:19", "people and it's gonna solve a problem it", "137:21", "just creates a much more much more", "137:23", "comprehensive problem it's important to", "137:25", "point out Gavin said has had many like", "137:27", "he said things way worse thing than Alex", "137:28", "Jones ever didn't turn whether whether", "137:30", "you want to say it's a joke or not he", "137:31", "said things like you know choke on punch", "137:33", "only uh-huh yep but but I guess was the", "137:37", "primary reason for", "137:38", "getting rid of them was what you thought", "137:39", "that the FBI had designated them", "137:41", "extremist group no cuz we did it", "137:42", "medicine months in advance okay yeah I", "137:44", "was just so he just it was just his", "137:46", "association with the proud boys I don't", "137:49", "recall and I would have to go back and I", "137:51", "don't want to misstate things I don't", "137:52", "want them all whether those statements", "137:54", "that you're referring to you if Gavin's", "137:55", "were on Twitter so they weren't there's", "137:58", "another you know when it comes to the", "137:59", "weaponization of rules against like", "138:02", "Gavin isn't creating a compilation of", "138:05", "things he's ever said out of context and", "138:07", "then sending them around get himself", "138:08", "banned other people are doing that to", "138:09", "him activists who don't like him and", "138:11", "it's effective in fact I would actually", "138:13", "like to point out there's one particular", "138:15", "user who has repeatedly made fake videos", "138:16", "attacking one of your other high-profile", "138:18", "conservatives so much so that he said to", "138:20", "file police reports harassment", "138:21", "complaints and it just doesn't stop you", "138:23", "know so I guess I'll ask this to this", "138:26", "regard if

yeah and if it's targeted", "138:35", "harassment and we can establish it it's", "138:36", "just a really hard thing with us", "138:38", "determining whether something is fake or", "138:40", "not well

"person saying it and you're making a", "138:51", "compilation of some pre-existing audio", "138:54", "or video so I think in this instance of", "138:57", "Gavin like one of the things he said was", "138:58", "like a call to violence but he was", "139:00", "talking about okay it was in the context", "139:03", "of talking about a dog and being scolded", "139:04", "yeah so he was like hit him just hit him", "139:06", "and then it's like it turns out he's", "139:07", "talking about a dog like running", "139:08", "something wrong when they take that they", "139:10", "snip it and then it goes

rigorous", "145:44", "and as durable something like making me", "145:47", "much stronger but I guess the challenge", "145:49", "is no matter what rule you put in place", "145:50", "people are going to

and you're communicating", "146:55", "about this on a very large scale and", "146:57", "it's putting that out there and then", "147:00", "people are discussing it whether they", "147:02", "agree or disagree whether they", "147:03", "vehemently defend you or or hate you", "147:06", "they're discussing this and this is I", "147:09", "think this is how these things change", "147:11", "and they

what I did notice was at the", "148:12", "bottom of the page it said due to you", "148:13", "know UK law certain things have been", "148:15", "removed so I don't know if it was", "148:17", "exactly why I couldn't pull up a video", "148:19", "proving or tweets or anything because I", "148:21", "think using these words get stripped", "148:23", "from the social platforms I could not", "148:25",

"148:34", "it up and I'm like oh that's weird so", "148:35", "now you have someone who doesn't realize", "148:37", "he's a fan of a bigot because the law", "148:41", "has restricted the speech mmm", "148:43", "so there's a point to be made if you I", "148:45", "understand you want a healthy like you", "148:46", "you want Twitter to grow you need to", "148:48", "grow the shareholders needed to grow the", "148:49", "advertisers need to advertise so you've", "148:51", "got all these restrictions but allowing", "148:53", "people to say these awful things makes", "148:55", "sure we stay away from them and it", "148:57", "allows us to avoid certain people and", "148:59", "isn't it important to know that these", "149:01", "people hold these beliefs if you get rid", "149:03", "of them you know someone could walk into", "149:04", "a business and you wouldn't even know", "149:05", "that they were a neo-nazi but if they", "149:07", "were high-profile saying the things", "149:09", "you'd be like that's the guy I don't", "149:10", "like you're absolutely right this is", "149:11", "like one of my favorite sayings is that", "149:12", "sunlight is the best disinfectant mmm", "149:15", "and it's so so so true I like one of the", "149:17", "biggest problems with censorship is the", "149:20", "fact that you push people underground", "149:22", "and you don't know what's going on and", "149:24", "this is something I worry about it's not", "149:26", "that I don't worry about he banned", "149:28", "people for these reasons I also worry", "149:30", "about driving people away from the",

I feel", "150:55", "like you know it", "150:56", "just gonna reiterate an earlier point", "150:58", "though you know if you recognize", "150:59", "sunlight is the best disinfectant your", "151:01",

to we have to work", "151:22", "with the technologies tools and", "151:24", "conditions that we that we have today so", "151:27", "and evolve over over time to where we", "151:30", "can see examples like this woman at the", "151:34", "Westboro Baptist Church who was using", "151:36", "Twitter every single day to spread hate", "151:39", "against the other pzq a community and", "151:43", "over time

"that's Michael Phelps she's amazing", "151:55", "and she's she's now pulling her family", "151:57", "out of that as well and you could make", "151:58", "the argument that if we banned that", "152:01", "account early on she would have never", "152:03", "left the church I completely hear that", "152:05", "we we get it it's it's just well so", "152:08", "let's I just want to make sure we're", "152:09", "advancing the conversation too and not", "152:11", "just gonna go back so I'll just ask you", "152:13", "this have you considered allowing some", "152:15", "of these people

think we're very early in our", "152:22", "thinking here so we're open-minded to", "152:24", "how to do this I think we agree", "152:26", "philosophically that permanent bans are", "152:28", "an extreme case scenario and it", "152:30", "shouldn't be one of our you know", "152:32", "regularly use tools in our tool chest so", "152:35", "how we do that I think is something that", "152:36", "we're actively talking about today is", "152:39", "there a timeline that we can so so look", "152:41", "you know like that would fix a lot of", "152:43", "problems yes I really didn't if it's", "152:45", "like I'm just curious like are you", "152:47", "thinking like fans of a year or five", "152:48", "years ten years like I'm just curious", "152:50", "like what is what is a reasonable ban in", "152:53", "this kind of context well I I think", "152:54", "reasonably so much enough to state their", "152:56", "case as to why they want to be unbanned", "152:58", "like someone should have to

about", "153:45", "this way is it better to they're", "153:46", "permanently banned or better but it's", "153:49", "not it's not good you don't know think", "153:51", "about this way instead of being", "153:52", "suspended for 72 hours you get a", "153:54", "dictionary block from hate speech words", "153:56", "right does that not make sense people", "153:58", "just using coded language this is what", "154:00", "we see all the time yeah I know well", "154:01", "they could move what do you think about", "154:03", "perhaps instead of what is it possible", "154:08", "to have levels of

about", "175:50", "Russia and stuff so they have no idea", "175:52", "what's going on but there'll come a time", "175:53", "when you know for instance one of the", "175:55", "one of the great things they brought up", "175:56", "was that by default when someone in DC", "175:58", "signs up they see way more Democrats", "176:00", "than Republicans right you remember that", "176:02", "when you testified yeah so well that", "176:05", "there's an issue and I don't think I", "176:06", "believe you when you say it's", "176:08", "algorithmic that these are you know", "176:10", "prominent

"176:36", "particularly around algorithms and one", "176:39", "of the things that we're really focused", "176:40", "on is not just fairness and outcomes but", "176:42", "also explained ability of algorithms and", "176:43", "I know Jack you you love the steps I", "176:45", "don't know if you want to talk a little", "176:46", "bit about our work there yeah I mean we", "176:47", "so there's two fields of research within", "176:50", "artificial intelligence that are rather", "176:52", "new but I think really impactful for our", "176:54", "industry one is fairness in ml so yes", "176:58", "and what fairness and machine learning", "176:59", "and deep learning so looking at", "177:02", "everything from what data set is fed to", "177:06", "an algorithm so like the training data", "177:08",

do that", "177:29", "because the reality is a lot of this", "177:31", "human judgment is moving algorithms and", "177:33", "the the second issue with in moving", "177:36", "algorithms is", "177:37", "is our rhythms today can't necessarily", "177:40", "explain the decision-making criteria", "177:41", "that they use so they can't explain in", "177:44", "the way that you make a decision you", "177:45", "explain why you make that decision", "177:46", "algorithm today are not being programmed", "177:48", "in such a way that they can even explain", "177:50", "that you may wear an Apple watch

that's a bad example because it", "178:02", "does it every fit every 50 minutes but", "178:04", "as we offload more and more of these", "178:07", "decisions both internally and also", "178:09",

"list out the criteria used to make that", "178:21", "decision so this is another area that", "178:23", "we'd like to get really good at if we", "178:24", "want to continue to be transparent", "178:26", "around our actions because a lot of", "178:29", "these things are just black boxes and", "178:30", "they're being built in that way because", "178:32", "there's been no research into like well", "178:34", "how do we get these our rooms to explain", "178:36", "what their decision is that might and", "178:38", "hasn't been asked my fear is you it's", "178:41", "technology that you need to build yeah", "178:43", "but the the public discourse is there we", "178:45", "know that foreign governments are doing", "178:47", "this we know that Democratic operatives", "178:48", "in Alabama did this and so I imagine", "178:50", "that you know with Donald Trump III you", "178:53", "know he talked about an executive order", "178:55", "for free speech on college campuses so", "178:56",

mean", "179:11", "there's a path some bills and and then", "179:13", "it's over again and clarifying I think", "179:16", "you guys are biased and I think what", "179:18", "you're doing is dangerous
