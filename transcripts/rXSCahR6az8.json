was him", "117:09", "and his son and he left his 13 year old", "117:12", "son with his dead wife and then went", "117:14", "back to war oh my god yeah she did it", "117:17", "because because he was killing people", "117:19", "yes all of his gases used right he was", "117:21", "she was apparently gravely she was a", "117:23", "scientist as well oh my she was gravely", "117:26", "upset at the

convinced", "118:48", "that just like his hobby method of", "118:50", "extracting nitrogen from the air he was", "118:52", "gonna be able to because the ocean has", "118:53", "gold in it a very small
