"41:43", "you're not submitting guys you're not", "41:45", "knocking them out", "41:46", "this is my mentality on that and this", "41:49", "has been since i was wrestling", "41:51", "as they were wrestling you could pin", "41:53", "guys really quick do slick moves and pin", "41:55", "guys", "41:55", "but then the guys would get up and say", "41:57", "oh man i never seen that movie before he", "41:59", "caught me in this slick move that's why", "42:01", "he got me now i'm gonna get him next", "42:03", "time i'm gonna do that", "42:04", "i'm gonna get him and the same thing", "42:06", "with the fight it's like", "42:07", "man i had my hand down and he caught me", "42:09", "sleeping so he caught me with a shot it", "42:11", "was a lucky shot he's not never gonna do", "42:13", "that shit to me if i next time i'm gonna", "42:15", "get him", "42:15", "oh he caught me with a slick submission", "42:17", "i've never seen that before", "42:18", "i'm gonna train for her next time he's", "42:20", "gonna i'm stop him", "42:22", "my thing is even wrestling what i always", "42:25", "wanted to do", "42:26", "is i wanted to tech fall guys in", "42:28", "wrestling and tech fall what that means", "42:30", "is", "42:30", "when you're beating someone by 15 points", "42:33", "you have a 15 point gap they stop the", "42:35", "match", "42:35", "because it's basically a skunk like you", "42:38", "skunk this guy", "42:39", "like he sucked that you beat him that", "42:40", "bad they had to stop it", "42:42", "that is my mentality that is always what", "42:44", "i strive for and in 2011", "42:46", "i believe i not 2011 2009 i led the", "42:49", "nation division one two and three", "42:51", "naia whatever in tech falls i think at", "42:54", "one point me and brett metcalf was", "42:56", "battling like", "42:57", "every week i would look and see who had", "42:59", "the most tech faults it was me be him be", "43:01", "me him", "43:02", "and i had the most because that's my was", "43:05", "my goals i wanted to skunk guys", "43:07", "because in their mind what it says is", "43:11", "you can't fuck with that guy there's you", "43:13", "can't hang with him", "43:14", "there was nothing you can do it no he", "43:15", "didn't it wasn't a quick pen a lucky pin", "43:18", "or or this like he destroyed you", "43:22", "he just set levels apart and that's what", "43:24", "i do even in fighting now", "43:25", "i do the exact same thing is i would", "43:27", "much rather", "43:28", "dominate you from start to finish i want", "43:30", "to break you", "43:32", "i don't want when you think about", "43:33", "fighting me again it's not you know i", "43:35", "don't want you to you i want you to say", "43:36", "fuck", "43:36", "no i don't know shit no he beat me", "43:39",

many guys and", "43:48", "wrestle i can't tell you", "43:50", "maybe 30 guys that i beat in wrestling i", "43:52", "don't have no idea", "43:54", "but the ones you lose you can almost", "43:55", "tell everyone", "43:57", "and that's what my my take on it i want", "44:00", "to dominate you so bad", "44:02", "when you think about fighting me again", "44:03", "you don't you say fuck that", "44:05", "i'll pass on that fight and so people", "44:07", "are like oh man this guy doesn't really", "44:09", "finish guys", "44:10", "but how many guys want to fight me again", "44:12", "not a lot of them",
