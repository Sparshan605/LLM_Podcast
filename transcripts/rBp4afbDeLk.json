you think about the millions of", "74:55", "people that must have seen that", "74:57", "the story on the rape of 1500 the fact", "75:01", "that only one person responded that way", "75:03", "right",

that was very", "79:49", "confusing about the vegas shooting is", "79:51", "people would go", "79:52", "into casinos they would flee from the", "79:54", "concert into casinos and then talk about",
