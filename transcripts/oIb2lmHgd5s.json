"02:29", "take before you found out that it wasn't", "02:30", "so I immediately started thinking I mean", "02:34", "so many things running through my head", "02:35", "I'm thinking about my parents my husband", "02:38", "my family everybody's in Hawaii starting", "02:40", "about what's going on in the state is", "02:42", "this real is it not real so that was", "02:44", "kind of the first thing like I kicked", "02:46", "into gear like okay let's let's make", "02:48", "sure this is legitimate the actual", "02:51", "threat from North Korea is a very real", "02:53", "one so it could very well be it was not", "02:55", "obvious that this was just a mistake", "02:57", "that people should blow off and that was", "02:59", "what I think most of the people in the", "03:01", "state understood as they started", "03:03", "thinking through what do we do with the", "03:05", "last minutes of our lives so I called", "03:11", "the first person I called was our state", "03:14", "adjutant general who's

just", "03:32", "saying hey this is not accurate I forget", "03:34", "exactly what I said but basically this", "03:37", "is a false alarm and then just started", "03:39", "getting on the phone making as many", "03:40", "calls as I possibly could but as I was", "03:43", "doing that I was getting text messages", "03:44", "and emails and things from people who", "03:47", "were freaking out", "03:49", "how far is Korea from Hawaii it's it's", "03:54", "over four thousand miles but that's not", "03:58", "very far it's for an intercontinental", "04:00", "ballistic missile and knowing", "04:03", "progressively just over the six years", "04:05", "that I've been in Congress and this was", "04:07", "a major issue that I've been bringing up", "04:09", "since I've been there in just raising", "04:12", "the alarm bells that North Korea is", "04:13", "increasing their capacity and their", "04:15", "their ballistic missile capabilities", "04:18", "that put Hawaii closer and closer than", "04:22", "reach Hawaii and Alaska particularly and", "04:26", "that's", "04:26", "I you know and and after people started", "04:30", "getting the word that this was a false", "04:31", "alarm", "04:32", "I started hearing from folks who just", "04:34", "shared their stories of what they went", "04:36", "through and you know in the news they", "04:37", "showed the guy who was lowering his", "04:39", "daughter down a manhole on the side of", "04:41", "the street his little girl oh god I", "04:44", "heard from another guy who said that you", "04:47", "know I had one kid in town in Honolulu", "04:49", "and another kid in Waianae over an hour", "04:53", "drive and he literally sat there", "04:56", "thinking how am I gonna choose which", "04:59", "child I'm gonna go and spend the last", "05:01", "minutes of my life with because you're", "05:03", "either driving in one direction or the", "05:04", "other there's so many so many stories of", "05:09", "it happen guy pushed clicked on the", "05:14", "wrong on the wrong alert message on his", "05:17", "computers was ultimately what happened", "05:20", "the one that said this is a drill did he", "05:24", "have like no glasses on or something", "05:26", "there's there's so many theories and and", "05:30", "his story has changed a few times and of", "05:32", "course is the subject of major", "05:33", "investigations and then after a while he", "05:36", "got fired he's actually suing saying he", "05:38", "was wrongfully terminated and almost", "05:40", "going on and if ever there was something", "05:43", "you could be fired for how could you be", "05:45", "wrongfully terminated for that mistake", "05:47", "that's my question to understand the", "05:49", "magnitude of your decision I mean that", "05:51", "is a giant fuckup yeah oh my god but", "05:54", "there it you know I think it it really", "05:58", "woke people up there were clear", "06:00", "vulnerabilities in our state alert", "06:01", "system that would even allow this like", "06:03", "allow one person to have that power to", "06:05", "do that is not it's obviously not good", "06:09", "and so there there are things that were", "06:11", "working to just to strengthen our civil", "06:13", "defense alert system but also just to", "06:14", "bring attention to North Korea and and", "06:17", "make it so that people aren't living", "06:19", "under this threat of possibility that", "06:22", "that could be a real thing and that", "06:24", "alarm could come through your phone and", "06:26", "know that you now have around 18 minutes", "06:29", "to find good cover or say your final", "06:33", "goodbyes well it's so scary because it's", "06:35", "such an erratic and dangerous regime I", "06:38", "mean it's when", "06:39", "you see what that guy has already done", "06:41", "and the people he's executed including", "06:44", "family members yeah I mean he's quite a", "06:48", "maniac and a legitimate dictator in the", "06:51", "old world kind of sense it's very", "06:53", "strange that he still I mean you you", "06:55", "think in the age that we live in they", "06:58", "would be very difficult to control an", "07:00", "entire country the way that they've", "07:02", "controlled North Korea for so long yeah", "07:04", "since the Korean War", "07:06", "but yeah they still can do it that they", "07:08", "are and I think that while it may be", "07:13", "easy to write him off as a maniac there", "07:15", "has also been a very consistent that", "07:20", "there there has been a consistency", "07:22", "throughout the different regimes of the", "07:24", "Kim family as they've developed this", "07:27", "nuclear a nuclear missile capability in", "07:30", "that they are doing it to protect", "07:34", "themselves against regime change war", "07:37", "essentially and they have said it", "07:39", "directly you know our US foreign policy", "07:42", "experts point that out that this is the", "07:45", "reason why they're developing this", "07:46", "capability because they have seen how if", "07:49", "you look at Libya for example when", "07:52", "Gaddafi was looking at you know building", "07:54", "and acquiring nuclear weapons he was", "07:57", "doing so also as you know to protect", "07:59", "himself in his regime and then he made a", "08:00", "deal with the United States saying okay", "08:02", "give up your nuclear weapons program and", "08:05", "we're not gonna you know don't worry", "08:08", "about it we're not going to touch you", "08:09", "and then of course we know what happened", "08:11", "the u.s. led this regime change war", "08:14", "toppled Gadhafi and and North Korea says", "08:16", "okay so that's what you do when you have", "08:20", "you know a leader of a country without", "08:23", "nuclear weapons to protect themselves", "08:25", "well it's also the consequences of that", "08:28", "regime change is a failed state and it's", "08:32", "more terrifying than even when Gadhafi", "08:35", "was in control I mean I'm sure you've", "08:37", "seen the the slave trade videos from", "08:39", "their fights insane it is horrifying it", "08:42", "won't happen to ya right in our lifetime", "08:45", "you know and that this this this failed", "08:48", "state has happened as a direct result of", "08:50", "our policy there are failed continuation", "08:53", "of these", "08:53", "change wars that we carry out in", "08:55", "different parts of the world right it's", "08:57", "almost like we don't learn from our", "08:58", "mistakes and I don't know what the", "09:01", "proper solution is I mean do you keep", "09:04", "someone like Saddam Hussein or someone", "09:06", "like Muammar Qaddafi do you keep them in", "09:08", "power and let them still be horrific", "09:10", "dictators and evil maniacs or do you", "09:13", "step in and cause more damage I mean", "09:16", "it's it's almost a lose-lose situation", "09:19", "it's yeah it's not a good situation but", "09:22", "it's where we as the United States need", "09:25", "to be pragmatic about the situation and", "09:29", "the fact that we live in the world that", "09:30", "exists not some kind of idealistic world", "09:34", "that is a fantasy and then think about", "09:37", "how counterproductive our acting as the", "09:42", "world's police has been has proven to be", "09:45", "in example after example after example", "09:47", "so yes there are bad people in the world", "09:49", "who do horrifying things but is it", "09:54", "really in our place to go in and take", "09:57", "action and say okay we're gonna remove", "09:58", "this person and then we're gonna put", "10:00", "this person in and this is how you're", "10:02", "going to govern this country and and", "10:03", "really acting acting as the world's", "10:06", "police and therefore and then as a", "10:07", "result as we've seen in Iraq and Libya", "10:09", "and now in Syria the people in those", "10:12", "countries are far worse off than they", "10:15", "were before we have and it's", "10:18", "counterproductive for our interests as", "10:19", "well because we have al Qaeda Isis and", "10:23", "these other terrorist groups who have", "10:25", "been strengthened directly as a result", "10:27", "of our policies in these countries when", "10:30", "you talk to people in the intelligence", "10:31", "community what what do they think", "10:34", "I mean you they're off the record or on", "10:36", "the record what do they think is the", "10:38", "solution for situations like that many", "10:43", "of them are hesitant to share their own", "10:46", "opinion because especially in the", "10:48", "intelligence community their job is to", "10:52", "report on what they're hearing what", "10:55", "they're gathering in the Intel that", "10:56", "they're bringing in and so on and so", "10:57", "forth but you know when you when you", "11:01", "talk with folks who operate in that", "11:02", "space the ones who are honest", "11:06", "and not trying to further specific", "11:09", "agenda or cover somebody else's bad", "11:12", "decisions there is a recognition of how", "11:15", "our policies of the past decades have", "11:18", "failed people in those countries and us", "11:22", "they've failed but have they failed as", "11:25", "bad or equally bad as if we did if we", "11:30", "did nothing like worse worse for sure we", "11:33", "yes you know yes worse for the people in", "11:37", "those countries worse for the people in", "11:39", "those countries as well as as as we", "11:41", "should be thinking about before we take", "11:43", "any of these actions is how does this", "11:45", "best serve the interests of our people", "11:46", "in this country and these actions have", "11:48", "been counter to those best interests and", "11:51", "so your question about so why do we keep", "11:54", "doing this I think there are a lot of", "11:58", "different things that go into that and", "12:00", "to drive that you know you have the", "12:02", "military-industrial complex that", "12:04", "benefits and makes a lot of money off of", "12:06", "our being in a perpetual state of war", "12:09", "you have a lot of other countries like", "12:12", "Saudi Arabia for example who dumped a", "12:14", "lot of money into the United States", "12:17", "and and kind of try to use our US", "12:22", "military as their forced to go in and", "12:24", "and do certain things the Middle East", "12:26", "that's more beneficial to Saudi Arabia", "12:28", "we see this happening in Yemen right now", "12:31", "yet another example interventionist war", "12:34", "jumping in there we're supporting Saudi", "12:38", "Arabia and their coalition in this war", "12:40", "that's created the worst humanitarian", "12:43", "disaster in the world they just bombed a", "12:45", "school bus and killed 40 kids a couple", "12:48", "of weeks ago and Yemen Yemeni civilians", "12:50", "bombed weddings in Yemen and yet our US", "12:55", "government is not saying hey we're gonna", "12:59", "stop and yank all of our support force I", "13:00", "review they're continuing to do it now", "13:04", "you're a veteran as a veteran deep", "13:07", "mean--you you've served our country you", "13:10", "you've put yourself in harm's way you", "13:14", "you were a part of the military there's", "13:17", "so many people that are making these", "13:18", "decisions that have not", "13:19", "yeah do you think that's a part of the", "13:22", "problem yes and that was that was one of", "13:24", "the main reasons that I ran for Congress", "13:26", "in the first place having come back from", "13:29", "my my own deployments the Middle East at", "13:32", "the Hawaii Army National Guard", "13:35", "experiencing and seeing firsthand the", "13:37", "cost of war both on our troops on our", "13:41", "friends who didn't make that trip home", "13:45", "with us as well as on the people the", "13:48", "people in these countries where we were", "13:50", "and I came back and saw just the", "13:55", "cavalier attitude that a lot of", "13:57", "politicians take due to making these", "14:00", "decisions and and I worked in a medical", "14:02", "unit and my deployment to Iraq we were", "14:05", "in a base about 40 miles north of", "14:08", "Baghdad and our base where we were was", "14:13", "was nicknamed more tarita Ville because", "14:17", "of the constant almost daily mortar", "14:19", "attacks and every day part of my job was", "14:25", "to go through a list of all of the", "14:28", "American injuries and casualties that", "14:31", "had happened the day before to try to", "14:33", "see if there were any of our close to", "14:34", "3,000 Hawaii soldiers who had been hurt", "14:39", "and to then make sure that they were", "14:41", "getting the care they needed either in", "14:43", "country or get him evacuate as quickly", "14:44", "as possible and just going through going", "14:48", "through that list name by name every day", "14:51", "whether there were people on there who I", "14:53", "knew personally or you know people who I", "14:57", "would never meet and knowing about the", "15:01", "family members and

"worse killed in action and I wondered", "15:17", "then you know how many of these", "15:20", "politicians who make these votes and who", "15:23", "make these decisions actually think", "15:25", "about this or who lose sleep on this do", "15:28", "you think a solution to that would be", "15:30", "mandatory military service for people", "15:32", "who are in", "15:33", "positions I don't you don't know what do", "15:36", "you think the solution because as a", "15:37", "soldier I don't you know I don't want", "15:39", "somebody in my foxhole who doesn't want", "15:40", "to be there first of all I think it's", "15:42", "you know having an all-volunteer force", "15:44", "which we have is a positive thing I", "15:47", "think that the American people need to", "15:51", "impress upon their leaders the", "15:56", "importance of taking these decisions", "15:58", "very seriously that if they want to", "16:00", "represent and make represent the", "16:03", "American people and make these decisions", "16:04", "for our troops and for our country they", "16:06", "need to understand who pays that price", "16:09", "for the cost of war and yes it is every", "16:13", "single one of our servicemembers both", "16:15", "those who pay the ultimate price as well", "16:18", "as those who come home with both visible", "16:21", "and invisible wounds and who will", "16:23", "continue paying that price for a very", "16:25", "long time to come", "16:26", "but also every one of our communities", "16:30", "filled with people who may not have worn", "16:32", "the uniform but who've had trillions of", "16:34", "dollars taken out of their wallet to pay", "16:37", "for these counterproductive", "16:38", "interventionist Wars as weaves in Hawaii", "16:41", "for example struggle to put air", "16:43", "conditioners in schools where kids are", "16:45", "trying to study in over a hundred degree", "16:46", "heat as we deal with massive", "16:49", "infrastructure problems people in", "16:51", "Michigan they just shut down the water", "16:53", "system in a bunch of schools in Detroit", "16:55", "because they have lead and poison in the", "16:59", "water for the kids so the kids are not", "17:00", "able to use the water fountains at", "17:02", "school so we have major infrastructure", "17:04", "major challenges and issues and so", "17:07", "making sure that leaders are held", "17:10", "accountable for the decisions that", "17:11", "they're making is ultimately what needs", "17:13", "to happen one of the things I like about", "17:14", "you and one of the things I've liked", "17:15", "about a lot of your interviews is you're", "17:17", "of an obvious genuine person like if", "17:20", "you're not genuine I'd be very shocked", "17:22", "that's very rare so when you're talking", "17:24", "about these politicians and having these", "17:25", "people being held accountable it's a", "17:28", "real problem but one of the problems", "17:30", "with politics and one of the problems", "17:32", "with public speaking and being", "17:34", "charismatic is a lot of these people are", "17:37", "just really good at being full of shit", "17:38", "and because they're really good at being", "17:41", "full of shit a lot of slack jawed", "17:42", "dum-dums out there buy into it hook line", "17:44", "and sinker waved that flag and kiss", "17:47", "those babies and they vote these dummies", "17:48", "into office and this happens time and", "17:50", "time again so saying you need these", "17:53", "people need to be aware of the", "17:56", "consequences or they need to be held", "17:58", "accountable I firmly believe there's", "18:01", "more sociopaths and we really think I", "18:03", "really do I think if you look at the", "18:05", "general consensus is something like what", "18:07", "is it one out of a hundred or something", "18:09", "like that what do they think it is maybe", "18:11", "more I think it might be ten percent I", "18:14", "think there's a lot of people that get", "18:16", "through life doing things and getting", "18:18", "away with things and not doing things", "18:21", "that are going to cause them either", "18:23", "danger or social consequences but they", "18:26", "but they manage to get through life with", "18:29", "a song and a dance yeah but they're not", "18:30", "genuine and I think this is a giant", "18:33", "problem with people that want to be in a", "18:35", "position of power in the first place", "18:37", "yes like why would they like why does a", "18:39", "guy like Donald Trump want to be the", "18:41", "fucking president when you have billions", "18:43", "of dollars in the bank like what are you", "18:44", "doing why are you doing that well it's", "18:46", "there's a weird motivation that a lot of", "18:48", "these people have and that motivation is", "18:50", "to be the uber you know to be the king", "18:52", "to be the the top of the heap to be the", "18:54", "queen whatever it is I don't know how", "18:57", "you change that in those people I don't", "18:59", "think making them aware of the", "19:00", "consequences of their decisions is gonna", "19:02", "work there it's just the type of people", "19:06", "who they

narrative right and it depends", "19:44", "and it changes based on what channel you", "19:46", "flick to or whatever because if you vary", "19:49", "in that narrative then you get less", "19:50", "access yeah I guess you could say that", "19:54", "you get less access to the people that", "19:55", "you want to have on those shows because", "19:57", "that's how you get your ratings in the",

where I felt I", "34:32", "stepped down from that position resigned", "34:34", "as vice chair to endorse Bernie Sanders", "34:37", "largely because of the huge difference", "34:39", "in their

about that influence on", "36:47", "politics I was talking with a guy whose", "36:49", "what'd he call himself a recovering kind", "36:51", "of finance guy from Wall Street who's", "36:53", "left and has now come here to LA and and", "36:57", "and he talked directly about that and we", "36:59", "were talking about how even after 2008", "37:02", "all the too-big-to-fail banks they were", "37:05", "bailed out and people are suffering", "37:07", "they're losing their homes or pensions", "37:08", "and all of this stuff these banks are", "37:11", "bigger today than they were back then", "37:13",

it bush", "46:13", "and gore whatever it was both elections", "46:17", "actually oh yeah okay but it showed how", "46:20", "there is built-in third party access so", "46:24", "it's literally built into the system", "46:26", "right that a third party can influence", "46:29", "the count yeah and they showed how they", "46:31", "did it on the in the actual documentary", "46:34", "they used these machines and influence", "46:37", "the results yeah I mean it's what to", "46:41", "speak of the", "46:42", "the the DEFCON hacking conference that", "46:45", "just happened or happens annually in", "46:47", "Vegas but they just had one this year a", "46:49", "couple of months ago maybe a few weeks", "46:51", "ago where an 11 11 year old girl hacked", "46:55", "into a replica of Florida's election", "46:58", "system and changed the outcome of their", "47:01", "election in less than 15 minutes there", "47:03", "it is an 11 year old hacked into u.s.", "47:05", "voting system relic in 10 minutes this", "47:06", "weekend well that's American ingenuity", "47:11", "ma'am that's what we do here we breed", "47:13", "them young and smart that kid exactly", "47:19", "right there's tons more tons more like", "47:22", "her there's probably millions now I mean", "47:25", "kids growing up with computers from the", "47:27", "time they're little in learning coding", "47:30", "like they're learning the English", "47:32", "language and just like the drive and", "47:35", "kind of the thought process and that", "47:37", "that kind of desire to take things to", "47:41", "them not just say okay okay this is an", "47:43", "iPad this is how it works that's fine", "47:44", "it's like oh how do we make the next the", "47:47", "next generation of this yeah how do we", "47:49", "break this and makes the next better", "47:50", "thing but we can Bank online right yeah", "47:54", "why can't they vote online why can't", "47:57", "they make all this as secure as they do", "47:59", "banking well you you still see every now", "48:03", "and then in fraud well yeah there's Bank", "48:05", "Fathers direct bank fraud but you also", "48:07", "see banks get hacked yeah and yeah", "48:11", "they've got I mean they've got you know", "48:13", "their reserves and all that other stuff", "48:15", "and they try to deal with those", "48:16", "vulnerabilities and try to stay ahead of", "48:18", "them but even the technology that banks", "48:21", "use is not foolproof right and when", "48:23", "we're talking again about voters having", "48:25", "confidence that when they take that time", "48:27", "on Election Day take off from work or", "48:29", "school or whatever and go cast that vote", "48:31", "that it's going to be counted and", "48:34", "counted accurately like this is what's", "48:36", "at stake if people don't have confidence", "48:38", "in that then then we are in serious", "48:42", "trouble so one thing that I introduced a", "48:45", "bill a few months ago based on last", "48:47", "year's DEFCON hacking conference results", "48:50", "that that really showed the best way to", "48:53", "secure our elections", "48:55", "some of the actual systems itself is", "48:57", "either used paper ballots or have a", "48:59", "voter verified paper backup if you're", "49:01", "going to use an electronic system so you", "49:04", "have an electronic system and then a", "49:06", "voter verified paper backup right so if", "49:08", "there's any dispute whatsoever then you", "49:10", "go to the paper go to the payment they", "49:11", "don't correspond you go to the paper", "49:14", "yeah so in Hawaii for example you can", "49:16", "choose when I go vote I can grab a paper", "49:18", "ballot traditional or I can go to the", "49:20", "the machine which I usually do go", "49:23", "through and make my selections and", "49:24", "before I hit the final submit ballot", "49:27", "button there's a little printout that", "49:28", "pops up in a little window that shows my", "49:32", "voter number who I selected to vote for", "49:35", "so I can actually check the paper myself", "49:37", "before hitting submit so Virginia just", "49:41", "did this Virginia has off-year statewide", "49:43", "elections so they had theirs in 2017 and", "49:46", "after that defcon hacking conference", "49:48", "happened last year they said we have to", "49:53", "fix this before our election and they", "49:55", "did how do that's what they implemented", "49:57", "it they did paper ballots or they did", "49:59", "paper about voter verified paper backups", "50:02", "and their elections commissioners came", "50:04", "and testified in Congress", "50:06", "after the elections were done and they", "50:09", "said that that was the first time in", "50:11", "their entire careers that they didn't", "50:13", "have a single complaint about the", "50:16", "accuracy of the vote count itself were", "50:19", "in previous years they had but they're", "50:22", "proof that you can turn like you", "50:23", "identify the problem this is not going", "50:25", "to take years to fix like you can action", "50:27", "that within weeks and actually secure", "50:30", "the outcome of these elections that's", "50:32", "what I've been pushing for in Congress", "50:34", "especially as we head to these midterms", "50:36", "especially as we head into 2020 but", "50:38", "again it goes back to the point like my", "50:40", "bill hasn't gotten a vote yet why is", "50:42", "that's a very simple like non partisan", "50:45", "bill here's a problem here's a solution", "50:47", "we can action this now but you have", "50:50", "leaders in both parties who are just", "50:52", "continuing to fightin and fret and moan", "50:54", "and groan about how we have all these", "50:57", "vulnerabilities in our elections but not", "50:59", "actually doing anything about it using", "51:02", "it as a partisan kind of political", "51:03", "football but again why why don't you", "51:06", "actually solve it why do you think they", "51:08", "don't solve it", "51:09", "because it's issues like this that help", "51:11", "with fundraising and they help kind of", "51:13", "motivate people and they worry people", "51:15", "and they bring all these fears about", "51:16", "it's good for ratings it's all these", "51:18", "different reasons that frustrate people", "51:22", "frankly who know about it when they're", "51:25", "not actually seeing you know deliver", "51:26", "results you're talking about a problem", "51:28", "now for months Congress has been talking", "51:29", "about this for months", "51:31", "where's the results so you think they", "51:34", "they actively are ignoring the potential", "51:38", "solutions or that they literally want to", "51:41", "keep this problem going that's a good", "51:43", "question but the the you know we have", "51:46", "been talking about this a number of", "51:48", "outside kind of election security", "51:50", "experts have been talking about this", "51:51", "some of the hackers have been talking", "51:53", "about the fact that the only way you can", "51:55", "secure an election is by using paper I", "51:58", "cannot I cannot come up with an excuse", "52:01", "for why the leaders in these committees", "52:04", "and in Congress have not actually it's", "52:07", "like whether it's my bill or someone", "52:09", "else's bill", "52:09", "why haven't they actually solved this", "52:12", "because it's something that could", "52:14", "potentially impact us in the coming", "52:16", "weeks and months well I remember the", "52:19", "hanging Chad yeah controversy yeah yeah", "52:22", "and how many different votes got thrown", "52:24", "out and there was there was also so many", "52:27", "people that were denied the right to", "52:29", "vote was it in Florida because they had", "52:33", "either the same name or similar names", "52:35", "with people that had some sort of a", "52:38", "criminal record if somebody made a typo", "52:40", "when they put their their name in the", "52:42", "system and then they were they were made", "52:44", "ineligible and then there was also some", "52:46", "concern that some of that was deliberate", "52:47", "because so much of it was taking place", "52:49", "in democratic districts yeah it's um", "52:53", "it's very disconcerting the idea that", "52:56", "someone would try to rig an election", "52:58", "yeah I mean we would like to think that", "53:01", "that is an absolutely unamerican thing", "53:03", "to think of but people can it is we can", "53:06", "come up with very strange reasons for", "53:09", "justification of very awful acts yeah", "53:13", "and this seems to be one of them if they", "53:14", "think their side is right well that that", "53:17", "points to the super delegate issue the", "53:20", "Democrats have been dealing with", "53:22", "we're people who have been arguing to", "53:25", "keep the system of super-delegates we're", "53:27", "in a state like mine in Hawaii for", "53:30", "example we've got four super delegate", "53:32", "votes two for the members of Congress", "53:35", "and two for the senator explain anthem", "53:37", "people don't know what a super dos so", "53:38", "this is something that is created by the", "53:43", "political parties themselves so the", "53:45", "Democratic Party has has been using the", "53:48", "super delegate system where as people", "53:51", "are running for president you have a", "53:54", "certain number of delegates that go to", "53:56", "one person or another based on that", "53:59", "state's rules so some states say it's", "54:02", "winner-take-all", "54:03", "other states say that it's proportional", "54:05", "so if you get 60% of the vote that means", "54:08", "you get 60% of the delegates but then", "54:10", "you have this special category of", "54:11", "super-delegates which there are over 700", "54:14", "of them it includes all 435 members of", "54:17", "sorry all Democratic members of Congress", "54:20", "Democrats in the Senate and people who", "54:23", "are appointed by the party leadership", "54:26", "both at the state and the national level", "54:28", "and so what we saw in in my state of", "54:33", "Hawaii for example is over 70 percent of", "54:37", "the voters voted for Bernie Sanders but", "54:41", "out of those four super delegate votes", "54:43", "he got one which is mine", "54:45", "so the super-delegates don't have to", "54:48", "cast their votes to reflect how the", "54:51", "their constituents voted so kind of the", "54:54", "rest of them vote they voted for Hillary", "54:56", "so that puts you in a situation where", "54:59", "and this is not about well Bernie would", "55:01", "have won without super dough this is not", "55:03", "even what that's about this is about", "55:04", "really looking at people casting their", "55:06", "votes and then you have this special", "55:08", "group of people who are they're elected", "55:10", "or appointed who can then say no I don't", "55:14", "I don't agree with the way that the", "55:16", "people in my state or my district voted", "55:17", "so I'm just gonna vote the other way and", "55:20", "then shift potentially the outcome of", "55:23", "that election for that state or for the", "55:24", "country so did it shift it for Hawaii", "55:26", "yeah yeah so Hillary won Hawaii's super", "55:32", "delegates but the people voted different", "55:35", "and there was 70% of the people yeah for", "55:38", "everything it wasn't close it was it was", "55:40", "but she won all state and that was how", "55:41", "how you saw so in some states where you", "55:46", "know I think I don't know if Vermont", "55:48", "there were there are a few other states", "55:49", "that I remember looking at where when", "55:55", "they were counting the votes as they", "55:56", "were coming in they would report one", "55:58", "number but if Bernie won the state his", "56:02", "number was zero and then there was a", "56:03", "certain number that was already built in", "56:05", "to Hillary's count before the votes were", "56:07", "even finally tallied because she had", "56:10", "already had the declared support of", "56:11", "those super-delegates within that state", "56:14", "so the Republicans don't do this I think", "56:17", "they may have super-delegates but those", "56:19", "super-delegates are required to reflect", "56:23", "the votes of their constituencies so", "56:25", "they don't have the freedom to change", "56:28", "their change their vote or change their", "56:30", "mind but yeah this is this so this is", "56:35", "something that I've been I've been", "56:36", "fighting to try to reform within our", "56:38", "party is to get rid of super-delegates",

easy", "62:39", "to go back and you say but look at this", "62:41", "interview from four years ago yeah when", "62:43", "they were completely different like what", "62:46", "happened I mean it's there's also like", "62:47", "calculated maneuvers that people do", "62:50", "politically to align themselves with one", "62:52", "group or another where they realize like", "62:53", "okay there's a

"63:02", "there's an angle for success right yeah", "63:05", "that's um all of those different labels", "63:10", "and things that people are capitalizing", "63:11", "on within the political world I think", "63:13", "are the things that are turning off more", "63:14", "and more people right to the politics", "63:16", "because then it's like well if you're", "63:18", "not branded with this label then I'm not", "63:20", "going to talk to you I'm not going to", "63:22", "have a conversation or it's this camp", "63:24", "versus another camp this tribe versus", "63:26", "another tribe rather than like", "63:29", "recognizing even amongst our own", "63:31", "families and friends and communities", "63:33", "like we we figure out ways to talk", "63:36", "things through and find ways to", "63:38",

"63:47", "and actually find a way through to move", "63:50", "forward there's a lot of things that", "63:53", "have been discussed in terms of the", "63:56", "future of of economics in particular", "64:01", "with regards to artificial intelligence", "64:04", "and automation and these radical changes", "64:07", "that are probably coming whether we like", "64:09", "it or not and one of the things that's", "64:11", "been discussed as a potential solution", "64:15", "to some of the economic whoa", "64:16", "is a universal basic income hmm have you", "64:19", "studied this I'm studying it now I'm", "64:21", "looking at some of the places that have", "64:23", "have or are currently kind of launching", "64:27", "pilot projects I know there's a European", "64:30", "country that did a two-year pilot and", "64:32", "then they decided not to go down that", "64:33", "route", "64:34", "I think there's uh so yeah I'm taking a", "64:38", "hard look at this because there there", "64:40", "are strong arguments I think on on both", "64:42", "sides we got to look and see what what", "64:46", "would the effects actually be yeah I'm", "64:48", "torn on it as well I'm very open to the", "64:51", "idea of it because I think that we very", "64:54", "well could run into a situation where", "64:56", "millions of people are almost instantly", "64:58", "out of jobs and there's no solution for", "65:00", "that and then out of jobs by their", "65:02", "choice or out of jobs by automation yes", "65:06", "exactly their position right I mean this", "65:08", "is a real problem yeah and and I don't", "65:11", "think I don't think it's gonna I don't", "65:14", "think it's kind of happened slowly right", "65:16", "I think that problems gonna stumble onto", "65:18", "us very quickly yeah and we are not", "65:22", "prepared for this and then there's a", "65:24", "problem psychologically people to say", "65:26", "that well if you just give people money", "65:28", "you take away their ambition and their", "65:31", "will and one of the things that makes", "65:32", "America great is it people hustle mm-hmm", "65:35", "and that you give a bunch of people", "65:37", "money that they don't earn and they're", "65:39", "gonna be lazy yeah this is the yeah", "65:42", "there's different arguments and I think", "65:44", "there's another one that points to if", "65:48", "you look at how much how much taxpayer", "65:50", "dollars are spent on like section 8", "65:54", "housing are different affordable housing", "65:56", "programs on food stamps on kind of these", "66:00", "different social welfare programs how", "66:04", "much are we spending on overhead to", "66:06", "administer those programs and so would", "66:08", "it make more economic sense to just kind", "66:11", "of compile all of those benefits into", "66:13", "one package and just give people a check", "66:15", "instead of piecing it out through all of", "66:19", "these different things and would we", "66:20", "actually save money as a country by", "66:23", "doing so and the argument to incentivize", "66:27", "productivity even amongst people that", "66:29", "are", "66:30", "accepting universal basic income I", "66:31", "believe is to let them keep it no matter", "66:34", "what so the idea is even if you make 10", "66:36", "million dollars a year you're gonna", "66:38", "still get X amount of dollars per month", "66:40", "as a universal basic income and you can", "66:42", "choose to donate that to causes of your", "66:45", "choice but if you're a person who's", "66:47", "concerned that this is going to somehow", "66:49", "another stifle people's motivation to", "66:52", "get jobs because if you get a job then", "66:54", "they won't get that money which is the", "66:55", "case with welfare yeah right so the idea", "66:57", "that you know you you it's very", "67:00", "difficult to get someone when you're", "67:02", "giving them free money to say look", "67:03", "you're gonna have to work harder and", "67:05", "then you're gonna get less mm-hmm", "67:06", "they're gonna go why why would I work", "67:08", "harder so the idea is and I believe Elon", "67:10", "Musk is one of the ones that came up", "67:11", "with this well don't take away the money", "67:14", "like everybody gets it no matter what", "67:15", "you could choose to do whatever you want", "67:17", "with it but the way to incentivize", "67:19", "action and productivity is to make that", "67:22", "money just universally available to", "67:23", "everyone yeah it's the universal aspect", "67:26", "of of that yeah you know I mean I I kind", "67:30", "of believe that I mean just culturally", "67:34", "people and we were talking about these", "67:36", "young kids for example you know I mean", "67:38", "they're not getting one paid one thing", "67:39", "or another but just their Drive and", "67:41", "their interest in kind of their", "67:42", "intellectual direction I don't know I", "67:47", "think people are not necessarily lazy by", "67:50", "nature and and I think there's something", "67:53", "to be said for wanting to actually get", "67:56", "things done and I think you you open up", "67:58", "rather than saying well we've just gotta", "68:01", "our purpose is just to work in a job you", "68:04", "may be broad in that spectrum to where", "68:07", "your purpose in life is not just to work", "68:09", "good-paying job but actually have", "68:11", "meaning and purpose to what you're doing", "68:14", "with your life that's best-case scenario", "68:16", "yeah best case scenario with universal", "68:18", "basic income is you give people the", "68:19", "opportunity to pursue their dreams right", "68:21", "yeah I mean I think that in in large", "68:24", "part maybe the problem is planting the", "68:28", "seed in young people at an early age", "68:30", "that you're you're not supposed to just", "68:33", "try to make money to survive that here", "68:36", "here's your money to survive just what", "68:38", "do you want what do you want what what", "68:40", "do you how do you think you would best", "68:41", "fit in in this world like what", "68:43", "is your contribution what could you do", "68:46", "and I think that's that's that opens it", "68:49", "up into kind of how we view education in", "68:51", "this country and how you know there's", "68:55", "all this this drive towards well you've", "68:57", "got to get a college degree you've got", "68:59", "to do this you've got to do that but", "69:00", "really there's there's a lot more where", "69:02", "people aren't asking those questions", "69:03", "like what do you really want to do with", "69:06", "your life asking that that most", "69:07", "important question of purpose yeah and", "69:10", "seeing well getting getting a bachelor's", "69:14", "degree or master's degree or whatever", "69:16", "that may not that may not be what you", "69:19", "want or how you feel you can best use", "69:21", "your time of your skills and whether", "69:22", "it's vocational training or doing", "69:24", "something else or be starting up a", "69:25", "business right away or or anything else", "69:28", "I think there's we just have to broaden", "69:29", "the spectrum here so that we're not so", "69:31", "tunnel visioned", "69:32", "more we're saying well you're gonna have", "69:34", "to go $60,000 in debt because you've got", "69:36", "to get a college degree of which you", "69:37", "will have no guarantee that you will get", "69:39", "this high paying job that you were", "69:40", "hoping to get so that you make lots of", "69:42", "money and then you end up wasting your", "69:43", "life wondering what the hell did I do", "69:44", "with myself that's a very good point", "69:46", "because I think the system that we have", "69:48", "in place is not perfect but yet we're", "69:50", "not fixing it right we're not changing", "69:52", "it and college education is essentially", "69:54", "subsidized and you have so much money", "69:56", "that these kids are in debt with by the", "69:59", "time they graduate I mean I had a friend", "70:01", "who made it through Medical School and", "70:03", "by the time he got out he owed more than", "70:05", "a quarter million dollars I was like", "70:08", "that is fucking crazy and he's like when", "70:10", "people talk about doctors and they talk", "70:12", "about doctors being greedy he goes you", "70:14", "have to understand that so many of them", "70:16", "are struggling just to stay alive", "70:18", "they're struggling just to pay their own", "70:20", "bills and keep the lights on the reason", "70:22", "why they want to see 20 30 people a day", "70:24", "and just keep pumping in the numbers and", "70:27", "just constantly you know do whatever", "70:29", "they have to do whether it's operations", "70:31", "or whatever it is and that they're not", "70:32", "considering the overall health and", "70:34", "welfare of these people and looking at", "70:37", "all these different solutions whether", "70:38", "it's nutrition or maybe there's a way to", "70:40", "avoid surgery or maybe there's a way to", "70:41", "you know figure it out always strengthen", "70:43", "your body first before we do this or", "70:45", "maybe we alter your diet and maybe not", "70:48", "getting enough sleep let's take that", "70:49", "into consideration and what kind of", "70:51", "pills you want and how are they", "70:52", "negatively affecting your health they", "70:53", "don't have that time for that they have", "70:55", "another person that's waiting and then", "70:56", "another person that's waiting and", "70:57", "to keep those people coming in because", "70:59", "they need that money yeah yeah but that", "71:01", "bananas it is and and that's where", "71:03", "whether we're talking about the cost of", "71:05", "education or the cost of health care for", "71:08", "that matter when we look at technology", "71:11", "and how we can both bring down cost and", "71:14", "improve quality in these areas I think", "71:17", "there's there's tremendous opportunity", "71:20", "in Hawaii there's a pilot program on the", "71:23", "Big Island right now called paramedicine", "71:25", "where current like Medicare", "71:27", "reimbursement laws say that as our EMTs", "71:30", "go out an ambulance to pick up somebody", "71:32", "they will only get

needs to see a mental health", "71:52", "professional or a social worker or", "71:54", "anything else so this idea of para", "71:56", "medicine that we're working on trying to", "71:58", "build and actually change some federal", "72:00", "policy to help support is really look", "72:06", "out for what does this person actually", "72:07", "need and not just shove them into this", "72:09", "healthcare system that drives up the", "72:11", "cost for everyone and also use", "72:13", "technology to do that so I was asking", "72:14", "him okay so you're not gonna be able to", "72:16", "physically bring a social worker with", "72:18", "you on all these calls like that's not", "72:19", "how you're gonna economize your cost", "72:22", "here he said oh no we bring an iPad with", "72:25", "us so as a social worker at the clinic", "72:27", "and then we can dial them in and they", "72:29", "can FaceTime with the person whose house", "72:32", "that we've gone to if that's the service", "72:34", "that they need and they can start", "72:36", "helping connect them to resources so", "72:38", "that's where you're able to help kind of", "72:40", "both bring down cost but also making", "72:42", "sure that we have the services", "72:44", "accessible to those who need them well", "72:46", "that's a fantastic idea just to avoid", "72:48", "the trips to the doctor or rudimentary", "72:51", "things right but one of the things that", "72:53", "Bernie Sanders brought up when he was", "72:55", "running for president that I thought", "72:56", "that was very very intriguing was the", "72:59", "possibility of free education and you", "73:03", "know obviously we have public schools", "73:04", "when it comes to high school and junior", "73:07", "high school and all that other stuff but", "73:09", "the idea of a public", "73:11", "full education through university to", "73:14", "degree do you think that's possible I", "73:19", "think you know the I think it's possible", "73:21", "but I think it doesn't get to the root", "73:23", "cause of the problem which is the cost", "73:25", "of Education and I think that if you", "73:29", "write that ticket then you are at risk", "73:31", "of then these education institutions", "73:34", "just saying okay so if you are", "73:37", "guaranteeing X number of dollars for a", "73:42", "student to go through and get that", "73:43", "education then we're going to adjust our", "73:46", "cost to make it meet that amount or if", "73:49", "it's a blank check then they'll know", "73:50", "that they have a blank check so we we we", "73:53", "have to we have to get to the root cause", "73:56", "of these challenges whether it is", "73:58", "education or health care we have to get", "74:02", "to the root cause of why are these costs", "74:04", "being driven up so dramatically and not", "74:06", "just say well we we're gonna pay for", "74:09", "everything without actually dealing with", "74:11", "the fact that
