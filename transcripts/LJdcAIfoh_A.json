"bag we got in here", "11:58", "it's $30,000 I'd never have to report I", "12:01", "think just yeah there's more behind why", "12:03", "that happens - it has to be that's", "12:06", "always been the idea that there's no", "12:07", "bribery going on anymore", "12:09", "it's crazy I don't want to say it but I", "12:11", "think I have yeah I think I have an idea", "12:13", "you know I think it comes down to who's", "12:16", "putting the show on mm-hmm and who's", "12:18", "who's in the pocket but Teddy Atlas was", "12:20", "explaining that to when he was on the", "12:21", "podcast one of the things that he was", "12:22", "saying was that they take these people", "12:24", "out to dinner like like they're all in", "12:27", "cahoots and friendly with each other and", "12:29", "if there's a certain result that the", "12:32", "promoter would like to see these judges", "12:34", "will lean towards that if they have a", "12:36", "good relationship with that promoter you", "12:39", "said it for me yeah that's what it did", "12:41", "look Teddy laid it out and I don't know", "12:45", "yeah it's bad because the given box is", "12:47", "really coming back it is and the fights", "12:49", "you got three or four weight classes", "12:51", "right now that's so interesting but the", "12:53", "bad part about it is you don't get", "12:55", "interested in it or you don't get as", "12:57", "excited anymore because you're afraid of", "12:59", "the outcome of the fuck yeah you know I", "13:00", "wasn't terribly upset at the wilder fury", "13:05", "decision I wasn't terribly upset I", "13:08", "thought I thought you know what I think", "13:10", "Tyson Fury did enough to win but when I", "13:14", "look at it I like when I like when they", "13:17", "scored", "13:18", "damage means a lot to me when I look at", "13:21", "that fight when when Wilder heard him he", "13:25", "heard him twice and he heard him real", "13:27", "bad I mean I think that's worth a lot", "13:29", "and I think he was always threatening so", "13:33", "I felt like I don't know if I would", "13:36", "agree with a draw I think it was a close", "13:39", "decision win for Tyson Fuhrer but I", "13:42", "didn't hate it I didn't hate it because", "13:43", "I think I'd like to see them fight again", "13:44", "absolutely I mean those one of them", "13:46", "fights were yes you're a hundred percent", "13:47", "right that it couldn't in the draw and I", "13:49", "think everybody would be kind of", "13:50", "satisfied with that yeah unfortunately", "13:52", "with the accountant knocked down which I", "13:55", "was so frustrated with the the comments", "13:57", "and you know how to stay away from the", "13:59", "social media and the boxing groups and", "14:01", "and things like that because all just", "14:03", "you know the some of the opinions of", "14:08", "people as the way to put it that was a", "14:11", "long count and this and that there's", "14:14", "been thousands of fights in the last ten", "14:16", "years and I've very seldom heard anybody", "14:18", "complain about a count you know that", "14:20", "that fight they don't do a 10-second", "14:22", "count in boxing they go by the referees", "14:24", "count right and for another thing we're", "14:27", "water kind of hurt himself", "14:29", "the referee tells you in the locker room", "14:31", "before the fight and he explains it to", "14:33", "you just go to your neutral corner if", "14:35", "you come out of your neutral corner I", "14:37", "will stop to count you mean you know", "14:39", "that so the first thing I used to do", "14:41", "when I drop somebody is I ran my ass to", "14:43", "that neutral corner you know so that", "14:45", "referee to start counting I didn't see", "14:47", "any issue with the knockdown I even", "14:50", "recorded it on my phone and if you did", "14:51", "go by the 10-second count", "14:53", "Tyson Ferry still beat it really yes I", "14:55", "have it you know I'd have to go through", "14:57", "and find it I thought I saw it on the", "15:00", "Instagram or one of them it was I think", "15:03", "it was on Wilders Instagram or he had it", "15:06", "where the count starts right when Fury", "15:08", "drops I counted it was his back almost", "15:10", "right before his back hits the ground", "15:11", "into where he got up and again that's", "15:14", "only a 10-second count got a referee", "15:15", "even coming over to him you know okay", "15:19", "but you know as far as the the fight", "15:21", "itself I gave I gave Walter obviously", "15:25", "two two knockdowns that's automatically", "15:26", "four rounds but I thought and I gave him", "15:29", "one other round after that", "15:31", "I thought Tyson ferry controlled the", "15:33", "action you know I had control the", "15:35", "momentum of the fight on the flip side", "15:38", "of it I think that water actually could", "15:40", "have made that easier fight to you know", "15:42", "water actually has a hard time with his", "15:44", "control he don't know how to really work", "15:46", "to the body I don't want to put it on a", "15:48", "trainer I don't know what the issue is", "15:50", "with that but he neglected that body a", "15:52", "lot throughout the fight and I just", "15:53", "thought that's why I Tyson won most of", "15:55", "those rounds you know he just controlled", "15:56", "the action the pace and was kind of able", "15:58", "to do what he wanted to and I think that", "16:00", "if water went back with his trainer and", "16:02", "watch the tape what a fight they're", "16:04", "gonna see a lot of opportunities that", "16:05", "were missed in that fight well you know", "16:07", "what's crazy about Wilder is how little", "16:09", "time he's actually been boxing I mean", "16:11", "it's really stunning when he was on here", "16:13", "he told us that he made it the Olympic", "16:15", "team a year and a half into weren't", "16:18", "learning boxing yeah and he won a bronze", "16:20", "medal in the heavyweight division no you", "16:22", "could kind of get away with that - yeah", "16:24", "you can you know most of your heavier", "16:26", "ball back then also we're big guys

fighting the best ever", "33:08", "yeah I mean it's just this it wasn't a", "33:11", "fixed fight I don't know why people", "33:12", "think it's a fixed fight that guy fights", "33:14", "it 126 pounds I think yeah I think", "33:16", "that's his weight class and you could", "33:17", "definitely tell the size", "33:19", "just like I could actually tell the size", "33:21", "difference though when McGregor fought", "33:22", "yeah Lloyd you know I think both the", "33:25", "Floyd's legs equal to one of McGregor's", "33:27", "yeah but yeah it's that tension that", "33:30", "fight the first knockdown was legit yes", "33:32", "and I think my personal opinion what", "33:34", "happened it wasn't fixed you know were", "33:35", "fake I believe that he got hit with that", "33:37", "right hand and it seemed that how strong", "33:39", "and how to defense the skills that uh", "33:42", "Mayweather had and I think he said you", "33:44", "know what this could be a long-ass night", "33:45", "and then the next couple punches he just", "33:48", "kind of like went down because he's seen", "33:50", "what could happen he knew which way that", "33:51", "fight was going really yeah that's what", "33:54", "you think I do the first knockdown let's", "33:55", "go so let's play that fight see if you", "33:58", "can find the fight and play it I feel", "34:00", "like the first one clipped him on the", "34:02", "temple he hit with a left hook on the", "34:03", "temple he didn't with a right hand but", "34:05", "didn't hit him with a left hook the", "34:06", "right hand and then he hit him", "34:08", "afterwards as well as he's going down", "34:10", "but I think that left hand to the temple", "34:12", "is what did the real damage", "34:13", "and then then there was a big right hand", "34:16", "afterwards that dropped him I just think", "34:18", "he was out of his League he's away way", "34:21", "out of his League", "34:22", "not that he took a dive but almost to", "34:23", "the point of like he knew that that", "34:25", "fight was not going anyway - wait he", "34:27", "thought it was he looks he was so smiley", "34:30", "and relaxed it was kind of funny you", "34:32", "know he just sort of walked the dude", "34:34", "down he had a big ol smile and say look", "34:36", "at him smiling well as last night and", "34:39", "he's so much like my kid right yeah he's", "34:42",

him", "34:58", "in seconds Oh what you went too far", "35:00", "there see he got up right there boom see", "35:04", "he hit him with the left hook and he", "35:06", "stumbled and then he hit him with the", "35:08", "right hand behind it and I just think", "35:10", "he's too little", "35:11", "he's just a he's a very small guy and", "35:14", "for him I mean and Floyd's not a big guy", "35:16", "this kid is tiny I mean I think he's", "35:20", "fought as light as 121 pounds and I", "35:22", "think sometimes he fights it like 126", "35:25", "yeah maybe I think you can see right", "35:26", "there right there sometimes at a fight a", "35:29", "lot of times in a fight the whole issue", "35:32", "is", "35:33", "you get hit with that and you're", "35:34", "fighting if somebody taps you with a", "35:36", "certain punch your brain you'll be", "35:37", "surprised how fast it works you know and", "35:39", "all the things that go through that mind", "35:40", "boom yes that's that was it yep and I", "35:44", "think at that moment right there he just", "35:46", "knew going in you could fill just was", "35:48", "somebody hit you on the arm or a", "35:49", "shoulder you know how much power they", "35:52", "have and I think he's just trying to", "35:56", "after that he knew that was gonna be a", "35:58", "long night so crazy they paid him nine", "35:59", "million dollars for this must be nice", "36:02", "[Laughter]", "36:03", "yeah I mean fuck there was a lot of", "36:06", "people I seen going up he deserves to", "36:10", "give some of these prospects a chance", "36:12", "now you know he should be fighting these", "36:14", "guys instead of doing this these guys", "36:15", "ain't boxers blah blah blah and my take", "36:18", "on that also is the man went 40 49 50", "36:22", "you know he fought almost everybody in", "36:24", "the sport even if you wanted to say that", "36:25", "they were past her prime some of them", "36:28", "may have been a little bit he still went", "36:30", "in there and dominated them and beat", "36:31", "them yes this guy in my opinion if he", "36:33", "wanted to fight defensive backs from the", "36:35", "NFL he has all the right in a role I", "36:38", "don't think that he owes the sport", "36:39", "anything I think actually it's the other", "36:41", "way around the amount of money that he", "36:43", "has brought to the sport the attention",

"37:07", "he will lose and I think maybe we're", "37:09", "smarter than that you know he wants to", "37:11", "go out and keep that his status and and", "37:14", "and the the record that he built up and", "37:17", "that resume that he has and go out like", "37:20", "that", "37:20", "yeah well they're talking about him", "37:21", "fighting khabib nurmagomedov who's the", "37:23", "UFC 155 pounds and pin but Kibby he's", "37:26", "not really a boxer he's I just want to", "37:27", "say but boxing rules yeah that would be", "37:30", "a same thing yeah Kabhi was a takedown", "37:33", "ground-type yeah exactly it would be the", "37:35", "same kind of fight as the counter fight", "37:37", "the only difference is I don't think", "37:38", "could be but get his tired as Conor", "37:40", "would yeah I know I don't think he's", "37:42", "definitely got better endurance", "37:44", "I think one of the only few in there", "37:46", "right now that would be a good fight", "37:48", "would be one of the Diaz brothers as far", "37:50", "as striking that would be interesting", "37:52", "but they that he would box their face", "37:53", "off he said I still think that he would", "37:55", "win that but I'm just saying as far as", "37:57", "you know stand up and letting the hands", "37:59", "go I think those are one of the one of", "38:01", "the two better ones in the MMA yeah I", "38:03", "mean he's got all the right in the world", "38:06", "to just keep fighting freakshows doesn't", "38:08", "have fun man and you know wait with her", "38:11", "the only thing is you know father time", "38:13",

"38:36", "as well like you've definitely saw that", "38:38", "with Bernard like Bernard up until the", "38:40", "Joe Smith fight me Joe Smith was the", "38:42", "first guy to really put it on him like", "38:44", "that and knock him out of the ring and", "38:45", "it was hard to see it was hard to see", "38:47", "that they they had that ring set up to", "38:49", "where he fell and landed on his fucking", "38:51", "head Jesus Christ you know I don't know", "38:53", "if those so much to ring I just think it", "38:55", "was an awkward way that he went out of", "38:57", "them ropes yeah in a way

"39:41", "almost a 50 years old was still", "39:43", "world-class which is really crazy that", "39:46", "is", "39:47", "you got a handful of guys out there I", "39:49", "could do that and to be honest you know", "39:51", "but he kept himself in good shape in", "39:53", "between fights yeah and he did what he", "39:55", "was supposed to do and some guys you", "39:57", "know you get some guys out", "39:59", "good friend of mine my trainer Robert", "40:01", "Garcia retired at 29", "40:03", "a young style guy Mancini retired young", "40:06", "and came back a couple years later but", "40:08", "it

"40:52", "expected", "40:52", "would you expect I expect him to be", "40:55", "tricky and sneaky and then just very", "40:58", "crafty and obviously experienced you", "41:03", "know I did jump up to weight classes to", "41:05", "take that fight and but at the same time", "41:10", "that was not an 80% Kelly Pavlik and", "41:15", "this is true and this is documented I", "41:16", "have it in my phone and I was gonna", "41:19", "actually bring that out but that fight I", "41:21", "sparred you know three times for that", "41:23", "maybe for the fourth time was one of our", "41:25", "embrace and then it went into it and I'd", "41:28", "never said anything because I'm the type", "41:29", "person I don't want to have people think", "41:31", "that was making excuses", "41:32", "I love Bernard and I think he's a one of", "41:35", "the greatest of all time greatest", "41:36", "middleweights", "41:37", "but that was not that night you know I", "41:40", "came down we had what's wrong

inhaler", "41:51", "for it then we found out through the", "41:52", "commission that you cannot take that", "41:54", "because it's steroid so we had to go to", "41:56", "the nasal or not nasal tube the pill", "41:59", "Horo pill we had it in the locker room I", "42:03", "don't know if you ever heard of a guy", "42:04", "Thomas Hauser", "42:05", "he writes yesterday from New York Times", "42:07",

"42:36", "society's bursitis in your elbow yeah", "42:38", "and you know that came into an issue and", "42:40", "we sparred we don't like I said it was a", "42:42", "handful it might have been more than", "42:43", "three or four but it wasn't a lot", "42:44", "because usually in training camp you do", "42:46", "it three days a week for about a week", "42:49", "camp for about six six and a half weeks", "42:51", "and it was because your elbow that you", "42:52", "couldn't spar yeah you know he didn't", "42:54", "want to keep pitting and then I didn't", "42:56", "like just the way I am I didn't like", "42:58", "having a brace on it or nothing so that", "43:01", "was an issue and there was a lot of", "43:02", "things that sometimes if you could go", "43:04", "back and you wish you

to tap into taking nothing away", "43:46", "from Bernard Hopkins", "43:48", "unfortunately against a guy like Bernard", "43:51", "Hopkins that had to have that happen to", "43:53", "me is what sucks and he was a tremendous", "43:56", "fighter I mean he did things in there a", "43:58", "lot of times I seen him making moves", "44:00", "that I knew what he was doing and I just", "44:02", "couldn't

talent level is extremely", "87:10", "high I mean it is with MMA as well but I", "87:13", "mean with boxing it seems to be on an", "87:15", "upswing and it also seems like people", "87:17", "are really interested in some of these", "87:18", "big rivalries like triple G and Canelo", "87:21", "that was two amazing fights I thought", "87:24", "the first one was a robbery I thought", "87:26", "that triple G won the first one but they", "87:28", "don't fight again really", "87:30", "yeah why's that because when you get a", "87:33", "guy that hits as hard as triple G does", "87:35", "and you get a guy that's as good as", "87:38", "Canelo you know and an earner", "87:40", "even though they're not getting dropped", "87:41", "and they're not getting knocked out that", "87:43", "some type of fights take a lot out of", "87:45", "you they really do and they shirt a lot", "87:47", "in those two fights and we don't know", "87:49", "even right now if the next fight or two", "87:52", "fight after that can also start showing", "87:53", "somebody effects from those first two", "87:56", "fights you think so yeah you get a guy", "87:58", "that hits two guys I hit that hard and", "88:00", "earn they're fighting like that", "88:01", "eventually it does drain you a little", "88:03", "bit and that will catch up I think in", "88:05", "third fight will shorten a career of", "88:08", "Canelo I'm not gonna say triple G", "88:10", "because triple G is my age now and I I", "88:12", "have a feeling that his might be getting", "88:14", "short here pretty soon anyways just due", "88:16", "to age but Canelo I mean that that's", "88:19", "those are brutal fights", "88:21", "they were brutal fights did you think", "88:23", "that some people thought that triple G", "88:25", "won the second fight as well I thought", "88:26", "it was much closer fight than the first", "88:28", "fight but did you think that Canelo or", "88:31", "triple G I think Canelo showed some", "88:32", "improvement but it's also possible the", "88:34", "triple G might have slowed down a little", "88:36", "bit", "88:36", "I think so you know the first fight I", "88:38", "had at nine three four triple G that's", "88:41", "how it sounds about right yeah and I", "88:42", "gave the first three rounds to Canelo", "88:44", "and then I had every round after for a", "88:46", "triple G this fight I thought Canelo one", "88:49", "close fight and if you gave it to triple", "88:52", "G I wouldn't have screamed we're all", "88:53", "right you know I think Teddy was saying", "88:55", "then he thought that triple G one but I", "88:58", "felt like well it's a pretty close fight", "89:00", "pretty close fight but certainly Canelo", "89:03", "showed much improvement he did and he", "89:05", "fought a better fight the first half of", "89:07", "the fight I gave up a lot of mouths", "89:10", "because I thought he controlled the", "89:11", "fight with two body shots and everybody", "89:13", "thought triple G was controlling with", "89:15", "the jab but the reason why triple G", "89:17", "wasn't using his size and strength was", "89:19", "because it was using his jab was because", "89:21", "of the body shots that canola was", "89:23", "landing I mean they were brutal and I", "89:25", "just thought Canelo dictated the pace of", "89:27", "those first couple of rounds", "89:28", "I thought he won enough of the early", "89:30", "rounds and obviously triple G one delay", "89:33", "the second most of the second half of", "89:35", "the fight but I thought it was a little", "89:37", "too late you know that I had Canelo up", "89:39", "by a round or two yeah it's it's just", "89:43", "what those are those are two fighters", "89:46", "that really sort of epitomize what", "89:49", "people like to see when they like to see", "89:52", "like these classic rivalries right like", "89:53", "a guy like triple G who's just forward", "89:56", "pressure constant throwing bombs", "89:58", "knockout puncher a guy like Canelo who's", "90:00", "just one of those classic Mexican", "90:02", "fighters as incredible heart wants to", "90:05", "fight the best of the best like really", "90:07", "like really takes it in the first fight", "90:11", "yeah yeah stay on the ropes with triple", "90:13", "G and let him let him use that power to", "90:15", "beat you organs then yeah one of those", "90:17", "fights you know I'm not one to talk I", "90:20", "kind of like getting in and getting", "90:22", "involved myself with guys especially", "90:24", "like with Miranda who I personally", "90:26", "believe hit hard in triple G really but", "90:29", "yeah and I was the guy in ER but that", "90:30", "was my strategy as were Canelo I was I", "90:34", "really wasn't a great strategy you know", "90:35", "I didn't lay on the ropes and let", "90:37", "Miranda do you think he just didn't know", "90:39", "what to expect until he was in there", "90:41", "with triple G it could have been because", "90:43", "everything changes like I think Mike", "90:44", "Tyson said it you know but he's got a", "90:46", "game plan until they get hit I he might", "90:49", "he got touched", "90:50", "I said even with the tension and that", "90:52", "Mayweather fighting the whole brain", "90:54", "mighty just started going a thousand", "90:56", "miles an hour trying to figure out", "90:57", "mm-hmm okay like this ain't gonna", "91:00", "probably work tonight with this guy cuz", "91:01", "he's a lot stronger than I expected and", "91:03", "he was just trying to maybe tire him out", "91:05", "the only issue is now you're when you're", "91:07", "on the ropes like that and you're", "91:08", "getting hit by a guy that hits that hard", "91:10", "and adults in the elbow in the forearms", "91:12", "and and to the body and then you're", "91:15", "tightening up and you're tensing up", "91:16", "really hard you're cutting the oxygen", "91:18", "off to the blood it tires you out", "91:20", "quicker and it wears you down you know", "91:21", "more than what he was doing in the", "91:23", "middle of the Ring", "91:24", "bye pomp chaton and and counterpunching", "91:27", "and he could have dictated how fast he", "91:29", "wanted you know how much you wanted to", "91:30", "punch how hard he wanted to punch yeah", "91:32", "we certainly made some big improvements", "91:34", "in that second fight yeah do you um you", "91:37", "you really don't want to see them fight", "91:39", "a third time I truly don't I mean if it", "91:41", "happens I'm gonna watch it you know but", "91:43", "they're gonna fight right I mean Cannell", "91:44", "is obviously gonna fight some people and", "91:46", "triple G's obviously gonna continue", "91:48", "fighting you know and again I don't know", "91:50", "how long triple G's gonna fight because", "91:52", "as you mentioned and I agree with you I", "91:54", "think he's starting to his age is", "91:56", "showing up a little bit with him Wow I", "91:58", "mean he he got avoided by a lot of", "92:02", "people and we you know when he had a", "92:06", "pay-per-view a couple years back that", "92:07", "only got a hundred and fifty thousand", "92:09", "buys and I remember thinking that is a", "92:11", "damn shame it is it's a damn shame that", "92:13", "people don't realize that this is", "92:14", "absolutely one of the best fighters ever", "92:16", "I was surprised by that too because I", "92:18", "think he's a lot more popular than what", "92:20", "those numbers show I didn't get it I", "92:22", "don't understand I mean I don't maybe", "92:26", "it's because they didn't think the fight", "92:27", "was competitive", "92:28", "maybe I mean I don't know what it was", "92:29", "but it just it seemed like I I just", "92:32", "think personally myself there's a lot of", "92:34", "fights out there for Canelo he just went", "92:36", "up to 168 yeah I'm not a big fan of that", "92:39", "you know think he's too small for saying", "92:41", "I do especially if you get him with the", "92:43", "right fighter I truly do believe that", "92:45", "you know everybody how tall is easy 510", "92:47", "yeah five-nine five-ten but you know", "92:50", "what boxing it over like football when", "92:52", "you see the height you always gotta take", "92:54", "an inch inch and a half off to so oh do", "92:56", "they live yeah I mean list of six three", "92:58", "I'm right under six to abut like", "93:00", "much so it's got like the football", "93:01", "program in our school right right", "93:03", "but um Canelo I think that there's guys", "93:07", "out there staying at sixty eight it's", "93:08", "kind of dangerous I think he's right now", "93:10", "talented enough to keep good fights out", "93:12", "there yeah but it's a little dangerous", "93:13", "in my opinion I think it 68 could cause", "93:16", "problems for him you got even the guys", "93:18", "like zurdo Benavidez mm-hmm those are", "93:20", "dangerous fights just them two guys", "93:22", "right there I would have to take not so", "93:24", "much overall skill wise just sighs and", "93:26", "and being at that weight and you know", "93:29", "they're you got guys coming down like", "93:32", "bball mm-hmm from 175 to 168 I think", "93:36", "that his better days are gonna be at 160", "93:38", "you know I think he does he have a hard", "93:40", "time making 60 or do you just have an", "93:41", "opportunity to fight 60 80 Tiger I think", "93:43", "it's the trophies yeah you know and I", "93:46", "don't blame him for that either he had", "93:47", "the right fight to go up to 168 so get", "93:49", "another weight division under his belt", "93:51", "yeah he was tuned in that dude up", "93:53", "I think w-what three now he's a three", "93:56", "weight class champ yeah and so that", "93:58", "looks good on paper when you retire ya", "94:01", "know it does I would have done it if I", "94:04", "could have you know if there was the", "94:06", "right fights out there but when he", "94:08", "fought Mayweather Mayweather made him", "94:10", "cut down to what 52 was it something", "94:11", "like I think they either had a", "94:13", "catchweight around that you know that", "94:16", "fight was to me what was a good learning", "94:18", "experience for him to be in there with a", "94:20", "guy was just slick as Floyd is but also", "94:22", "a good learning experience he you're not", "94:24", "supposed to suck that much weight out of", "94:25", "your body just he didn't have the fire", "94:27", "no even though you have 24 hours or", "94:30", "however long it is to try to rehydrate", "94:33", "that's never enough time to recoup yeah", "94:35", "this night so your your thing is you're", "94:37", "just hoping your opponent's going", "94:39", "through the same thing that you are you", "94:41", "know that's what it comes down to what I", "94:43", "do like about boxing that is missing in", "94:45", "MMA is more weight classes I really", "94:48", "think that and that's one of the things", "94:49", "that people have a problem with in", "94:50", "boxing they think there's too many", "94:51", "weight classes I don't agree with that I", "94:53", "think if anything there's too many world", "94:55", "champions I think it's ridiculous that", "94:57", "in any organization that one guy could", "94:59", "be a WBC world champion the other guy", "95:01", "could be a w-a there's an IBF WBO I mean", "95:04", "like that's crazy it's crazy to have", "95:06", "that many world champions it should be a", "95:09", "world champion but how do you decide", "95:11", "what organization is", "95:12", "real sanctioning body do all you just", "95:14", "need one sanctioning body yeah I don't", "95:17", "know how you would do that either", "95:18", "because it's all money", "95:19", "they're also corrupt yeah it's all money", "95:22", "it's hard to do that I I see your point", "95:25", "on that a little bit and then I also", "95:27", "look at like you got so many guys that", "95:29", "are so good yeah", "95:31", "and there's a boxing is a short window", "95:33", "so like how long can you stay on the", "95:35", "feet until you finally get that chance", "95:37", "to fight the top guys top dog and", "95:41", "anything can happen in boxing - you know", "95:43", "I kind of like I may be knocking down a", "95:46", "three", "95:46", "but I think when you have the different", "95:48", "weight classes now you got four people", "95:50", "just say one person has each belt you", "95:52", "got four world champs now you're looking", "95:54", "at these four guys and you can start", "95:56", "taking these prospects and start saying", "95:59", "this would be an interesting fight with", "96:00", "this guy and this guy and then I do", "96:02", "believe that they should make make", "96:05", "happen one undisputed champ yeah I", "96:07", "believe so - okay that should happen in", "96:09", "every weight class", "96:09", "yep they should have a fight off for a", "96:11", "box off and the four champions or you", "96:15", "know you may be dead that way keep the", "96:16", "prospects in line and have the four", "96:18", "champions fight off did you know who is", "96:20", "the undisputed champion and then your", "96:22", "prospects get your shot you know it just", "96:24", "seems weird to have more than one world", "96:26", "champion you're either the world champ", "96:28", "it's like how many guys won the Super", "96:30", "Bowl this year how many teams won one it", "96:32", "should be one you can't have multiple", "96:35", "world champ like when Anthony Joshua was", "96:38", "walking around as a heavyweight champion", "96:39", "but also Deontay Wilder is walking", "96:41", "around as a heavyweight champion like", "96:42", "what what is this is are you the", "96:44", "heavyweight champion or you the champion", "96:46", "of the new organization that falls into", "96:48", "like what kind of again what we were", "96:49", "talking about earlier with Jermaine", "96:51", "Taylor thing when he vacated abouts okay", "96:53", "yeah in my mind you won the unified to", "96:56", "fire or Universal recognizable the ring", "96:59", "the ring middleweight title because", "97:00", "where does the lineal begin when does it", "97:02", "not and I had to ring title", "97:04", "alright so usually in most cases the", "97:06", "ring title was undisputed or lineal", "97:08", "champ so in other words the champ oh", "97:11", "that way class right you know it's", "97:13", "something but for the most part you know", "97:15", "who is the champion of a weight class", "97:16", "ring magazine's title is almost as", "97:19", "valuable as anybody this is s1 and", "97:21", "that's the one that I really showcase", "97:22", "when I show people my nice my case you", "97:25", "know what's so classic to would like the", "97:26", "the stripes and the love I think Rock", "97:29", "you've really did a lot for that boat -", "97:30", "yeah yeah yeah yeah well it's a classy", "97:35", "looking belt you know and everybody else", "97:36", "got the big ones with the leather and", "97:37", "the strap like the Ring Magazine is a", "97:39", "nice one yep", "97:40", "I wanted the belts you know I didn't", "97:42", "want to pay to sanction fees for all", "97:44", "forward belts but I wanted to still", "97:47", "wanted to IBF and WBA and you know to", "97:50", "put in a trophy case", "97:50", "but fortunately laden fights fell", "97:53", "through when you were coming up when you", "97:56", "were a kid and you were watching boxing", "97:57", "we go Hagler fan I was

a real world-class fighter is", "106:50", "breaking down situation because you're", "106:51", "getting to see it from their perspective", "106:52", "of how they would approach it in it's", "106:55", "not just a guy who's a boxing experts a", "106:57", "guy who did it who did it yeah a guy who", "106:59", "was a world champion like Andre Ward", "107:01", "like when Andre Ward's on I fucking love",

my", "126:12", "guy to run out whatever I'm gonna get", "126:13", "the best run out that's the time I want", "126:15", "him to run he'll adapt and especially", "126:18", "after he keeps fighting he'll adapt it's", "126:19", "more mind over body but I think the gym", "126:23", "is non-negotiable at 3 o'clock I like to", "126:27", "Train and if I was training guys my", "126:28", "Jamar's would be between 3 & 7", "126:31", "why do you like late-afternoon because", "126:33", "it gets you closer to the fight night", "126:34", "you know especially close to a fight I", "126:36", "would like

"126:54", "talking about me being a trainer I would", "126:56", "like that for my fighters so what you've", "126:58", "learned from your career just apply it", "127:01", "yeah the only thing I would really take", "127:03", "from it would be the running in the", "127:06", "morning you know if my guy wanted said", "127:08", "hey coach I'd rather run after the gym", "127:10", "tonight and I knew that that was gonna", "127:12", "make a difference in a minute on his", "127:13", "mouth okay run a night because I want", "127:16", "him to get the best run possible", "127:18", "you know that's most important so did", "127:19", "you run for speed did you do sprints did", "127:22", "you do long-distance running like with", "127:24", "it what kind of running did you do I did", "127:25", "do sprints

I've got one side that's", "127:34", "pretty big is steep you know it goes up", "127:37", "and I would do that probably about three", "127:38", "times the camp for unbeliever you got to", "127:40", "watch how many times you do that", "127:42", "throughout of camp because it builds", "127:43", "muscle especially running that high you", "127:45", "know you know steps and then when you", "127:47", "start cutting the weight and you got to", "127:48", "get done it's going to be hard to lose", "127:50", "that extra pound which could make a big", "127:52", "difference come fight night", "127:53", "so for a six eight week camp you would", "127:55", "only run it three times three times yeah", "127:56", "and then I had Sprint's on the hills and", "127:58", "I did regular sprints because the", "128:00", "regular Sprint's is firing a fast twitch", "128:02", "muscle and it's also hitting a big", "128:04", "muscle and it's building the legs and", "128:05", "strength distance was important but", "128:08", "still another big one to me is the pad", "128:11", "work you know the training at the gym", "128:13", "I'm not a big fan of bag work anybody", "128:16", "hadn't have a good punching bag how come", "128:18", "because you learn how to", "128:21", "manipulate the bag and you know trick", "128:24", "your trainer and everybody else I can go", "128:26", "ahead a bag right now I probably do 10", "128:28", "rounds on it you know just because I", "128:30", "know how hard to punch it's hard to tell", "128:32", "us to worry when you're hitting pads I", "128:33", "know how hard my guys punching and I'm", "128:35", "giving him the combos in the numbers so", "128:37", "he has no time to concentrate on what", "128:40", "you want him to do and he's not throwing", "128:41", "the

and", "135:54", "lift I'm not saying every exact time you", "135:56", "got to kill it but when I go in I want", "135:59", "to do either a little bit heavier or", "136:01", "more reps than I did last time you know", "136:04", "what I mean for me to get to the point", "136:06", "where I want to get in it has worked for", "136:08", "me I do I feel like when you write down", "136:10", "the only time
