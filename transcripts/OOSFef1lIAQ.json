that that's why I", "48:43", "was able to put that that performance on", "48:46", "and use that many kicks because we throw", "48:48", "so many in one day you know", "48:49", "what's different about the training", "48:50", "there there's not there's not really", "48:53", "classes like for MMA there's not much", "48:57", "talking in tighten my tie there's no", "49:00", "talking you know it's like

in the in the MMA", "49:12", "class George gives us a lot of time to", "49:15", "drill and drill at our own pace and", "49:18", "things like that before we go alive and", "49:19", "I think that that's what's helped me the", "49:21", "most is less talking more drilling show", "49:25", "me one or two things we're mixed martial", "49:27", "artists we're gonna create something off", "49:28", "of it it's okay mm-hmm and just let us", "49:31", "drill it let us drill it walk around", "49:33", "cook you know correct if you need to but", "49:35", "I think people need to spend more time", "49:37", "drilling on the mat go live every now", "49:40", "and then just so you can feel what your", "49:41", "output the only way you're gonna get", "49:43", "good is by drilling yeah it's just not", "49:45", "as fun exactly", "49:46", "it's training I don't think training", "49:49", "should be fun you tell a dog to sit a", "49:50", "hundred times you got to give him", "49:51", "something like you know some type of", "49:53", "treat so the promise certain parts of", "49:54", "training are fun right yeah which is", "49:55", "probably one of the reasons why you like", "49:57", "striking exactly it's fun that part for", "49:59", "me I can just yeah yeah yeah it's um", "50:02", "it's I really believe that psychologists", "50:05", "should study fighters study high-level", "50:09", "fighters to try to figure out what makes", "50:11", "them tick because there's all these", "50:12", "different versions you're a different", "50:14", "version you the 300-pound guy decides to", "50:17", "lose all this weight and now you wanted", "50:19", "the best fighters in the 205 pound", "50:20", "division and yeah it's crazy man I mean", "50:23", "that's a that's a wild story it'd be", "50:25", "really cool though yeah yeah", "50:27", "maybe you'll get one psychology studies", "50:29", "on fighters is almost mandatory because", "50:32", "there's certain guys that like they're", "50:33", "just impenetrable", "50:34", "you know there's certain guys that just", "50:36", "they just like khabib is impenetrable if", "50:39", "you're not getting more shit you talk", "50:41", "more he's gonna fuck you up when he gets", "50:43", "ahold of you like it's not working man", "50:45", "it's not getting in there and then", "50:47", "there's certain guys that like sometimes", "50:48", "they're hot and sometimes they get", "50:50", "rattled and you know it's it's a crazy", "50:54", "endeavor what you guys do really is yeah", "50:57", "it definitely is man I think", "50:59", "a documentary or something would be", "51:01", "really cool to yeah I think a lot of", "51:03", "people and the fans need to see kind of", "51:06", "a little bit more of the inside the real", "51:07", "stuff you know yeah the real stuff like", "51:10", "one of the craziest responses that I've", "51:13", "been getting lately is people have hit", "51:15", "me up on Instagram like I can't believe", "51:17", "you're just a normal guy like you're", "51:19", "posting songs and and you know like", "51:21", "doing all that I'm like yeah I'm human", "51:23", "just like everybody else like I think a", "51:24", "lot of fans kind of forget that I think", "51:27", "we as fighters sometimes forget to like", "51:29", "hey like for a little bit you can shut", "51:31", "it off and yeah normal yeah it's uh I", "51:36",

"somewhere into the top 15 you know for", "126:56", "sure no nowhere and the guys that are at", "126:58", "the very top because they're all kind of", "127:03", "tied up they're all pretty tied up you", "127:05", "know and I definitely think it'll be a", "127:07", "while before I can actually fight Jones", "127:08", "mm-hmm because just like how things are", "127:12", "how things are laid out like I know it", "127:14", "for sure Johnny walkers ranked and he's", "127:16", "already kind of like in talks like he's", "127:18", "the guy to beat John Jones so sure", "127:20", "they're gonna try

"131:00", "fight Anthony Smith Gustafson Gustafson", "131:02", "still a beast but no one is like really", "131:05", "standing out as being like this person", "131:08", "that everybody wants to see

didn't think like", "132:27", "ah he's gonna destroy me no never like", "132:30", "so I I'm gonna continue to be tested", "132:33", "it's interesting your approach because I", "132:35", "wonder if the the fact that you were", "132:37", "such a non-confrontational guy and you", "132:39", "are really easygoing helps you in that", "132:42", "you have like less conflict in your head", "132:45", "I almost wonder because even the way you", "132:48", "approach like these different matchups", "132:50", "and everything you like you kind of put", "132:52", "your ego aside you're looking at the leg", "132:54", "what is the smart thing to do here the", "132:56", "smart thing to do is not take this fight", "132:57", "against this newcomer guy I've already", "132:59", "lost a newcomer guys the smart thing is", "133:01", "okay", "133:01", "we realized that Thailand was extremely", "133:03", "beneficial let's fucking move to", "133:05", "Thailand oh yeah so you're doing all", "133:06", "these like

and if it", "134:19", "had to happen now like yeah I definitely", "134:21", "think about it and I'd probably lean", "134:23", "more towards doing it than saying no do", "134:25", "you have guys trash talk to you mm like", "134:29", "you're pretty easygoing guy easygoing", "134:31", "it's it's nothing to my face it's always", "134:33", "subtle if I ever hear about anybody", "134:36", "saying something it's just through word", "134:37", "of mouth and it was like yeah well but", "134:39", "you never had like a Conor McGregor type", "134:41", "incident where is only in the beginning",
