sort of", "14:09", "sit around and try to figure out what", "14:10", "I'm gonna what I'm going to expand upon", "14:12", "like what what ideas I'm going to start", "14:15", "planting and then try to make them grow", "14:16", "on stage this is the this is a scary", "14:18", "part of doing stand-up I wouldn't say", "14:20", "like obviously it's not scary but this", "14:23", "is the the most troublesome or", "14:26", "nerve-racking or or exciting it's the", "14:29", "most exciting time of standup the most", "14:31", "exciting is certainly like the actual", "14:33", "filming of a special that's very", "14:35", "exciting and the idea that it's done and", "14:38", "okay I did that material the best", "14:41", "justice I could do and now I'm going to", "14:43", "release it and then the most exciting", "14:47", "part after that is this this period that", "14:50", "I'm at right now where I don't have shit", "14:52", "I don't have any new material I have a", "14:55", "bunch of subjects I have a bunch of", "14:57", "ideas that I wrote down on my phone I", "15:00", "have a bunch of subjects that I talked", "15:02", "about on stage a few times but they", "15:04", "never really became bits and I will", "15:06", "eventually piece those out and I'll put", "15:09", "those up on a cork board with index", "15:12", "cards to take index cards and I write", "15:14", "the subjects down and I slap them up on", "15:16", "a cork board so I can look at them in my", "15:19", "office and I've got a few of those but", "15:22", "man this is about as fresh and embryonic", "15:25", "a state as my stand-up is ever in it's", "15:30", "there's a period that I've been over the", "15:33", "last few years I've been doing it every", "15:34", "two years every two years seems to be", "15:36", "like a good number for me like I guess I", "15:38", "could probably do a new hour every year", "15:40", "but I don't think it would be it's at", "15:42", "its best and some of those bits they get", "15:45", "better as time goes on and I would love", "15:48", "to have what I think is as close to the", "15:50", "finished version as I can before I", "15:53", "release it so um so two years seems to", "15:56", "be the time that and so there's this", "16:00", "period where you sort of slam down the", "16:04", "samurai sword you hammer it down get it", "16:07", "to the best edge that you can get it to", "16:09", "and then throw it all away and start", "16:13", "from scratch", "16:14", "so that's where I'm at you know so uh", "16:18", "these kind of podcasts probably help", "16:20", "subject matter is it's just up in the", "16:26", "air I mean I don't know what the fuck", "16:27", "I'm gonna talk about so let me get to", "16:29", "some of these questions I'm kind of", "16:30", "rambling

anymore but", "16:51", "they still call him President Carter I", "16:53", "don't know how that works but what I do", "16:56", "know is that he will be on the podcast", "17:00", "next Thursday with Doug Stanhope", "17:03", "so Gary Johnson and Doug Stanhope", "17:06", "together because doug has an idea a", "17:09", "great idea that we're going to announce", "17:11", "on the podcast I guess I could kind of", "17:13", "announce it now or talk about it now", "17:15", "what Doug's idea is is to do a live", "17:19", "podcast during election night an", "17:21", "election night coverage podcast and do a", "17:25", "series of podcasts actually live from", "17:28", "the Comedy Store so the idea is we get a", "17:31", "bunch of different guys who have", "17:33", "podcasts and gals and you know whoever", "17:35", "signs up for whoever we decide to have", "17:37", "on it but I believe bill burns in I", "17:39", "believe Marc Maron's in Doug's in I'm in", "17:43", "and what we're going to do is we're", "17:44", "going to do these podcasts live and", "17:47", "either we'll all be on stage the Comedy", "17:50", "Store at the same time or we will we'll", "17:53", "mix it up and you know we'll have like", "17:55", "shifts or something like that or I think", "17:58", "it's probably going to be as as informal", "18:01", "as possible so that's the deal I'm", "18:05", "uncomfortable here because I'm sitting", "18:06", "down this weird way where I'm trying to", "18:08", "lean into this microphone and I think", "18:11", "when you get too close to these things", "18:13", "it picks up a

"33:16", "bit of lag in between when you would", "33:18", "shoot and when it was show up on the", "33:20", "screen dependent upon how fast your", "33:22", "connection was but if you had a pretty",
