["00:00", "the girag and experience now how did you", "00:03", "get involved in this you started you", "00:06", "said 24 years ago doing drug research on", "00:08", "animals how did what was what led you to", "00:10", "want to go down this road so I was in I", "00:13", "tell the story in the book and so I was", "00:15", "in the Air Force", "00:16", "back in the 80s like you mentioned about", "00:18", "crack cocaine so I was in the Air Force", "00:20", "over in England 86 87 88 and crack", "00:26", "cocaine was a big deal in the United", "00:28", "States as you point out and I grew up in", "00:30", "the hood in Miami and Miami was a", "00:33", "cocaine capital in the United States and", "00:35", "and so things that were happening in my", "00:38", "community that were not good high", "00:41", "unemployment crime all of these kinds of", "00:44", "things", "00:44", "I blame crack cocaine for that and so I", "00:47", "thought that if I go to school and get a", "00:50", "degree in order to study drugs the", "00:52", "effects of drugs on the brain I could", "00:54", "solve the problems that face my", "00:57", "community or problems that I thought", "00:58", "were in the community particularly those", "01:01", "related to drugs and so I began studying", "01:03", "drugs as an undergraduate and then went", "01:05", "on to graduate school to study drugs on", "01:08", "the brains of animals and to try to", "01:11", "figure out the neurobiological", "01:12", "mechanisms that were responsible for", "01:14", "addiction she just got fascinated by", "01:17", "this idea of fixing this issue that you", "01:20", "saw in your community and then you just", "01:22", "fell into a rabbit hole yeah so when I", "01:24", "started along my journey my path I", "01:27", "actually got in education and you know", "01:29", "so as James Baldwin said you know the", "01:33", "the paradox of education is precisely", "01:35", "this as one begins to become educated", "01:38", "and conscious one begins to question the", "01:41", "society in which he's being educated and", "01:43", "that's what happened with me and so", "01:45", "along the way I discovered things like", "01:47", "hmm the majority of people who use these", "01:49", "drugs are not addicted that was one", "01:51", "thing I discovered I discovered that", "01:52", "many of the things that we said about", "01:54", "crack about crack cocaine were just", "01:56", "simply not true like the cold crack baby", "01:58", "myths and people said that when that our", "02:01", "generation beep should be prepared to", "02:03", "have an army of kids who couldn't learn", "02:06", "because of being exposed to crack", "02:08", "cocaine that just simply wasn't true", "02:10", "when all the data came out there", "02:13", "beginning in the mid-1990s we realized", "02:15", "that that simply wasn't true", "02:17", "other things that I learned that just", "02:19", "simply wasn't true things like one hit", "02:23", "of crack cocaine you're addicted not", "02:25", "true that crack cocaine was different", "02:27", "from powder cocaine not true all of", "02:29", "these things I discovered of long way", "02:31", "that they won't they weren't true and", "02:33", "not only that I discovered that this", "02:36", "wasn't new I went back to the early", "02:39", "1900s and saw the same sort of hysteria", "02:43", "mainly race-based hysteria surrounding", "02:45", "drugs occurred even then and so I", "02:49", "thought what's what's going on and then", "02:51", "that helped me to be more critical about", "02:54", "my issue is there a difference in the", "02:57", "the effect of crack cocaine the physical", "02:59", "effect and and and cocaine and heroin so", "03:02", "let's think about crack let me not not", "03:04", "here on rather how to conquer powder", "03:06", "yeah let's think about crack cocaine and", "03:08", "powder cocaine let's just think about", "03:09", "the chemical structure the only", "03:10", "difference between crack cocaine and", "03:12", "powder cocaine is that the powder", "03:13", "cocaine has this thing called the", "03:15", "hydrochloride salt attached to it that", "03:17", "salt prevents it from being smoked", "03:20", "now you can dissolve the powder cocaine", "03:22", "and in water and in shooting in your arm", "03:24", "and so you have the effects of cocaine", "03:27", "the onset of the effects within seconds", "03:30", "the same is true with crack cocaine the", "03:33", "effects are onset of a sex effects are", "03:35", "within seconds now the biological", "03:38", "activity of cocaine is at the base not", "03:41", "that so that hydrochloride portion on", "03:43", "the on the cocaine powder on the powder", "03:46", "cocaine has no biological activity", "03:48", "whereas so that means that crack and", "03:51", "powder are the same drug they are", "03:53", "exactly the same drug the same effect", "03:56", "same drug Wow so it's indistinguishable", "03:58", "to the user indistinguishable now why is", "04:01", "it that they prepare it that way like", "04:03", "what's the benefit of preparing it it's", "04:05", "just so delivery quicker great question", "04:07", "so one of the things that you you might", "04:10", "recall Richard Pryor back in the days", "04:12", "when he got he burnt and he burnt", "04:13", "himself with smoking so he was", "04:16", "freebasing", "04:17", "and so he was removing that", "04:18", "hydrochloride portion of the salt off of", "04:21", "the off of the cocaine base so he could", "04:23", "actually smoke it now he was using ether", "04:26", "which", "04:26", "is highly flammable with crack cocaine", "04:29", "you don't now you no longer need the", "04:31", "ether you just mix it up with baking", "04:33", "soda and water and the cocaine and you", "04:36", "mix it up and you get rid of that salt", "04:38", "so ether is no longer needed and it's", "04:40", "not as dangerous so that's one of the", "04:42", "reasons that we have crack cocaine as a", "04:45", "result of that and it also it made it so", "04:48", "you could sell them in unit doses to", "04:51", "make the drug appear to be cheaper", "04:53", "because you also might recall in the", "04:55", "early 1980s 1970s you had to buy cocaine", "04:58", "powder in bulk and that made it more", "05:00", "expensive crack cocaine made it a lot", "05:03", "more simple simple for people to buy it", "05:05", "who didn't have the kind of a expendable", "05:09", "income that was required before the mid", "05:12", "1980 so essentially they just brought it", "05:14", "down to bite sized portions that's right", "05:16", "exactly", "05:17", "rather than selling this whole six-pack", "05:19", "or 12-pack now you can sell one item one", "05:22", "can or one bottle I want to talk more", "05:24", "about this but I should just clarify the", "05:26", "Richard Pryor changed his story as he", "05:27", "got older and actually said that he", "05:29", "tried to kill himself he lit himself on", "05:31", "fire apparently I'm a huge Richard Pryor", "05:34", "fan and I know that that was originally", "05:36", "what he had said that he got burnt doing", "05:38", "freebase but I think he changed his", "05:39", "story later I actually worked with him a", "05:43", "bunch of times right before he died was", "05:45", "a real honor he's a real special dude as", "05:47", "far as stand-up comedians go yeah with", "05:50", "you but that that um style of like", "05:54", "freebase was a thing that we'd always", "05:56", "associated with people that were really", "05:58", "really fucked up yeah like the guys", "06:00", "doing coke oh well you know he's", "06:02", "probably gonna mess up his life he's", "06:03", "freebasing", "06:04", "oh shit yeah he's gone man he's based", "06:07", "and he's a basehead yeah right base head", "06:09", "was the thing before crack I was lace", "06:11", "heads absolutely I described a cup of", "06:13", "people in the book from my neighborhood", "06:15", "who got into freebasing in exactly the", "06:18", "same way you just talked about right", "06:19", "absolutely", "06:20", "um now everybody has this idea in their", "06:24", "head that crime and that everything", "06:27", "escalated in the world changed when", "06:30", "crack was introduced is that a myth as", "06:32", "well yeah it's a myth well what let me", "06:35", "clarify because on the one hand so when", "06:37", "crack hit the market its first sort of", "06:40", "talked about December 1984 in the LA", "06:43", "Times the first time we heard a crack", "06:45", "but it didn't become more widely known", "06:48", "or available until maybe the mid", "06:50", "nineteen mid nineteen eighty-five", "06:52", "now once crack cocaine hit the markets", "06:56", "what happened was that people were", "06:58", "fighting over various new markets", "07:00", "whenever there are new illicit markets", "07:02", "yeah you're going to get some violent", "07:04", "activities until the market settles down", "07:06", "that happened with any illicit market", "07:08", "and that certainly happened with crack", "07:09", "cocaine now one of the things that", "07:12", "people there are a number of things that", "07:14", "people attributed to crack in terms of", "07:16", "crime and all of the sort of downfall of", "07:19", "certain communities unemployment they", "07:21", "said that unemployment really rose as a", "07:23", "result of crack cocaine being around now", "07:26", "nineteen eighty two the unemployment", "07:28", "rate in this country was about 11", "07:31", "percent for white folks and it was", "07:33", "double that for black people", "07:34", "that was before crack at least two three", "07:37", "years before crack even hit the market", "07:39", "now doing the whole crack era", "07:41", "unemployment has never been as high as", "07:44", "1982 that's number one people said", "07:47", "things like people from my community", "07:50", "crack cocaine what's responsible for", "07:52", "these mothers these grandmothers now", "07:55", "raising new generations of kids because", "07:57", "their daughters were strung out on crack", "07:59", "and so now they have to take care of", "08:01", "these kids that simply wasn't true it", "08:04", "certainly happened in in my community", "08:06", "but it happened before crack cocaine was", "08:08", "ever on the mark and certainly happened", "08:10", "in my family long before crack cocaine", "08:12", "ever hit the market when we look at", "08:14", "other communities like particularly", "08:16", "immigrant community if you look at the", "08:18", "Jewish community when they came over to", "08:20", "Eastern European Jews when they came", "08:22", "over in the country there early nineteen", "08:24", "hundred eight or 1800s and so forth what", "08:27", "you see is that you had a similar sort", "08:29", "of phenomenon going on in those kind of", "08:31", "communities what's his name urban how", "08:34", "his great book land of our fathers a", "08:37", "home of our fathers he kind of described", "08:39", "all of these pathological behaviors that", "08:41", "happened in that community many of those", "08:43", "same behaviors were attributed to crack", "08:46", "cocaine and black people later but it's", "08:48", "not it they were there long before crack", "08:50", "cocaine was there but crack cocaine", "08:52", "became the scapegoat", "08:54", "that's a fascinating scapegoat because I", "08:56", "bought into it hook line and sinker I", "08:58", "really thought that there was a", "09:00", "difference between the 1980s and the", "09:02", "1990s as far as like when crack was", "09:03", "introduced boom it took off it was sort", "09:06", "of something that was just always", "09:07", "discussed as like common fact ya know I", "09:10", "bought into it too and that's what drove", "09:12", "me to pursue my education in the way I", "09:14", "did but as a result of pursuing that", "09:17", "education I discovered that it was not", "09:20", "true", "09:20", "so are these cultural myths the result", "09:23", "of politician like political campaigns", "09:26", "we're trying to clean up the streets and", "09:28", "they attributed to certain issues or is", "09:30", "it is it as something more widespread is", "09:33", "it the media just running with a", "09:34", "narrative what it what is it how did it", "09:36", "get started well there are multiple sort", "09:38", "of factors and players involved so when", "09:41", "we think about the politicians for", "09:42", "example politicians if crack cocaine is", "09:45", "the problem never mind the fact that", "09:47", "unemployment rates was out of control", "09:50", "before crack cocaine hit the market hit", "09:52", "the market unemployment was out of", "09:54", "control a number of things were already", "09:57", "problematic now you have crack cocaine", "10:00", "if you blame crack cocaine it's really", "10:03", "easy to simply say we'll put more law", "10:06", "enforcement we'll hire more cops we'll", "10:08", "put more efforts in controlling these", "10:10", "drugs a lot easier to say will lock", "10:13", "people up for selling these drugs for", "10:15", "using these drugs in the process what", "10:18", "you do is you create jobs for a select", "10:20", "group of people and then you don't have", "10:22", "to deal with the real issues the real", "10:24", "issues of unemployment of deprivation", "10:27", "all of these things you don't have to", "10:29", "deal with they're far more complicated", "10:30", "and so politicians are happy to buy in", "10:33", "now one of the things about crack", "10:35", "cocaine is that we think about the law", "10:37", "that punishes or punished crack cocaine", "10:39", "a hundred times more harshly than powder", "10:41", "cocaine and the vast majority of people", "10:44", "who got punished under these laws were", "10:46", "black eighty eighty-five percent of the", "10:47", "people even though they don't make up", "10:49", "the majority of the users so people say", "10:51", "things like well were those laws racist", "10:54", "and the laws themselves weren't racist", "10:56", "because the blood Congressional Black", "10:58", "Caucus 17 of the 21 members voted to for", "11:02", "these laws for these laws that punish", "11:05", "crack cocaine a hundred times more", "11:06", "harshly but the", "11:07", "point is is that everyone bought into it", "11:10", "parents bought into it because the", "11:12", "parents did for the parents what this", "11:14", "meant is that you don't actually have to", "11:16", "educate your kids about this you just", "11:18", "say that they're bad and stay away from", "11:20", "it no education require even sciences", "11:24", "and treatment providers they all bought", "11:25", "into it because you got a problem we're", "11:28", "going to solve your problem so we are", "11:30", "needed and we are valued all so you had", "11:32", "all of these sort of constituencies from", "11:34", "society benefiting from the vilification", "11:37", "or the scapegoating of crack cocaine all", "11:39", "of those things didn't came together", "11:41", "nicely and then we think about the", "11:43", "rappers they all came into the game too", "11:46", "because it's like I'm conscious I'm", "11:48", "going to say that this is a problem my", "11:50", "community and I care about my community", "11:53", "and this is the way that I can show it", "11:55", "so everybody had a stake in this sort of", "11:58", "thing Wow that is absolutely fascinating", "12:01", "you know one of the things that I've", "12:04", "talked to quite a few people about when", "12:06", "it comes to issues like real complex", "12:09", "issues like drug addiction and and", "12:11", "violence and in poverty is that once you", "12:15", "feed it with any organism whether it's", "12:18", "that what organism is law enforcement or", "12:20", "that organism is education", "12:21", "whichever one you feed is the one that's", "12:23", "going to grow and once you feed the law", "12:26", "enforcement one and you look at this", "12:28", "really complex situation I think law", "12:30", "enforcement is important but I think", "12:32", "education is probably more important to", "12:34", "avoid future law enforcement like the", "12:36", "more I think the more education we have", "12:38", "the the more nuanced our ability to", "12:41", "raise children is the more we understand", "12:43", "you know that we're all in this together", "12:44", "the less you're going to need law", "12:46", "enforcement but when law enforcement", "12:48", "becomes this machine that lobbies", "12:50", "against the legalization of certain", "12:52", "drugs which when you start looking at", "12:54", "the data there's only one reason to do", "12:56", "that and the only reason is that you're", "12:58", "trying to stay alive you're trying to", "13:00", "grow your an organism you're trying", "13:01", "trying to eat the sugar you're trying to", "13:03", "keep going so you're creating more jobs", "13:06", "by putting people in jail it's", "13:08", "essentially no one wants to look at it", "13:10", "like this but it's a form of slavery I", "13:12",
