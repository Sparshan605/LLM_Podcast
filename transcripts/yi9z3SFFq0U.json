in", "59:07", "a disaster that's more likely yeah but", "59:09", "the crazy thing is how quickly then if", "59:11", "that's the case how quickly then we came", "59:14", "from some sort of ape-man to what we are", "59:17", "now you know it hasn't been that long", "59:19", "the amount how long ago is they think", "59:22", "this was built this shit was built like", "59:25", "at least a thousand years ago I think", "59:26", "right so I don't think they know though", "59:28", "see the problem is if you don't you have", "59:30", "to get stuff from like something that", "59:33", "someone ate or it has to be like a", "59:35", "carbon-based thing you can't test the", "59:38", "stone you can test some of the material", "59:40", "in the stone", "59:41", "or you know like scratches on the stone", "59:43", "like in crevices and shit like that you", "59:45", "can get stuff but when they run around", "59:48", "you know that would have been several", "59:50", "thousand years of man advancing at that", "59:52", "point a thousand years ago right wonder", "59:54", "I mean I don't know when it's hard to", "59:55", "say cuz I don't know when it was", "59:56", "actually built when do they think it was", "59:57", "built so these all these theories and", "60:00", "then there's these really fringe", "60:04", "theories that push everything way way", "60:06", "way back and that stuff gets resisted a", "60:08", "lot because the carbon dating though", "60:10", "right in some in some case occupied", "60:13", "since 900 900 occupied since 900 that", "60:17", "means nine hundred somebody moved in", "60:19", "yeah and then just had to until the", "60:21", "about the 13th century that's a long run", "60:23", "so who built it though do they know when", "60:26", "do they guess I think because I think it", "60:29", "doesn't say like what year was built or", "60:31", "you said occupied from 900 yes does that", "60:34", "mean that that's when they first moved", "60:35", "in indicate the earliest occupation on", "60:37", "that hilltop dates to about 900 CE okay", "60:40", "so", "60:41", "wow they built it over 400 years or so", "60:43", "it sounds like so more than a thousand", "60:45", "years hmm yeah but like you know the", "60:48", "jewels in years is hard to wrap your", "60:49", "head of the Jewish calendar goes back to", "60:51", "like fifty seven hundred years ago", "60:53", "no no so nuts right so banned his but", "60:56", "man had a lot of time to get some sweet", "60:57", "tech but 900 yeah it's so arbitrary that", "61:00", "we start at zero then start up again you", "61:02", "go backwards and you go into negative", "61:04", "number so it was so stupid it's so dumb", "61:06", "yeah it's we Christians it's weird how", "61:09", "we do that yeah yeah I mean even with", "61:11", "like temperature yeah it's not being on", "61:15", "the metric system so stupid like you go", "61:17", "to places Neal Celsius what's it's", "61:19", "always 2030 Celsius outside here what", "61:21", "the fuck is 23:00 Celsius but if you", "61:23", "learned anything though I agree I'm like", "61:25", "so we should we're all gonna die so", "61:27", "we're all gonna die we winter Hatter", "61:31", "shorts I have no idea but they a lot of", "61:34", "them no are stupid shit because this is", "61:37", "interesting there's more sort of a we're", "61:39", "like that's like a real American move", "61:41", "like they tried to switch over in the", "61:42", "70s to the metrics and people like fuck", "61:44", "you ain't learning French man did I", "61:46", "remember it I remember it being taught", "61:48", "in school I was in school they tried", "61:51", "they tried soccer - yeah", "61:54", "just picking up now just maybe a little", "61:56", "heat now yeah a little bit a little bit", "61:58", "a little bit but yeah it's funny to me", "62:01", "that stuff like that's kind of what I", "62:02", "love about America it's like that just", "62:04", "like that but yeah we're not gonna do", "62:05", "the non interest the rest of the world", "62:07", "yeah we don't give a shit", "62:10", "it sounds French it sounds gay sounds", "62:13", "like a gay symmetry is the matricis a", "62:17", "music gay math okay we're Americans it's", "62:19", "better though I mean it's intense why", "62:22", "are we doing 12 so it's better and and", "62:24", "but it is it confusing when somebody", "62:26", "tells you a metric you know they say", "62:27", "like oh it's a leader like liters of gas", "62:30", "I'm always or if you drive in Europe", "62:31", "right and you're looking at the you know", "62:33", "speedometer it has the conversion on", "62:35", "there for you but whenever we you'd say", "62:37", "like 12 inches is a foot like why 12", "62:39", "fuck is that what is that why did you", "62:43", "why did you arbitrarily you know that's", "62:46", "and it's only us in a few other", "62:48", "countries that still accept that right", "62:50", "what that 12 inches yeah how many people", "62:52", "do that do they accept it in Canada", "62:54", "Canada's metric right and then three", "62:55", "feets a yard like thanks Canada's metric", "62:58", "yeah it is I think yeah but most places", "63:00", "are metric yeah I have a friend from", "63:02", "Australia my friend Adam Greentree and", "63:04", "he talks in meters", "63:05", "there's about hunting 20 meters what", "63:07", "that means now is that that'd be like", "63:10", "how many football fields yeah there's", "63:14", "only two distances I understand school", "63:15", "bus length and football field why things", "63:18", "have been taught to me how many meters", "63:20", "are in a real unit of measurement like a", "63:21", "real one like an American one how many", "63:25", "feet we're in that fucking meter fucking", "63:29", "goofy-ass meter yeah it's a yard I want", "63:32", "to know what a yacht a yacht 30 yards", "63:35", "away mm-hmm yeah that's it you know when", "63:38", "you're in school the only way they teach", "63:39", "you about the distance of things as", "63:40", "stack school buses or football field you", "63:43", "like the moon is 147 million football", "63:45", "fields do you like that now I understand", "63:47", "whatever the distance is but it's always", "63:49", "it's always converted to football fields", "63:52", "at school buses always right yeah as a", "63:54", "student that's all I remember ever in", "63:56", "science that would be like taking school", "63:59", "buses and going from here to Australia", "64:01", "you know and you're like it's like

yeah it's true it's like how far", "64:13", "did she live like two football fields", "64:14", "and three school buses we could get we", "64:17", "can walk we could walk it's pretty cool", "64:19", "no it's cold so how cold is it 24", "64:21", "Celsius Oh so 23 tells these supreme", "64:26", "yulux is that like 70 degrees I have no", "64:28", "idea I literally have no idea I know a", "64:31",

in that way", "64:42", "if it gets to like 30 I'll go hey it", "64:44", "must be hottest because zero Celsius is", "64:46", "32 mm right because their zero is", "64:50", "freezing zero is our that's freezing yes", "64:54", "but our 40 below is the same as their 40", "64:57", "below doing another math trick it's", "65:00", "tough okay 9/5 Celsius plus 32 9/5", "65:05", "Celsius plus 32 and fuck you it's almost", "65:12", "a half just it's a little bit under ass", "65:14", "fuck somebody one of you fuck one of you", "65:16", "somebody we need to figure out who's", "65:17", "who's got a simpler thing than who's get", "65:21", "a simpler think 9/5 get the fuck out of", "65:24", "here with your with your ferret mentally", "65:27", "we need which over two Celsius but zero", "65:29",

don't", "65:39", "know if it maintains for very long or if", "65:41", "degrees get colder and I don't know yeah", "65:44", "I don't know it's just zero makes more", "65:47", "sense as the yeah it's weird like how", "65:49", "the fuck is if our 32 is the Celsius", "65:53", "zero how the fuck is is the same thing", "65:55", "at 40 below it doesn't even make sense", "65:56", "make sense how are you not just adding", "66:01", "he said my friend gave me this tip", "66:04", "double the centigrade temperature", "66:06", "subtract the first digit of the result", "66:09", "and the result and then add 32 to that", "66:12", "okay sure all right you really yeah so", "66:15", "23", "66:17", "okay so 46 and then what we do with the", "66:19", "first digit of the result there it is", "66:21", "right there", "66:22", "so 23 Celsius equals 74 Fahrenheit 23 C", "66:26", "plus C times 2 is 46 minus the first", "66:30", "digit so minus the 4 46 minus 4 is 42 42", "66:35", "plus 32 is 74 hey fuck you that's the", "66:42", "easy one well what's amazing to me is", "66:45", "like when you meet someone that lets you", "66:48", "know like what you just talked to them", "66:50", "about math and they can

I", "67:17", "haven't done long division and I and I I", "67:21", "tried doing that problem and I got it", "67:23", "wrong and then I had to read I was like", "67:25", "oh yeah you know like it was like yeah", "67:27", "it it was it was confusing and I haven't", "67:30", "done it in where's the last time you put", "67:32", "out a pen and paper to do a long", "67:33", "division dude I barely do

with archery that's fascinating", "72:40", "I do think though shooting a gun is like", "72:43", "that not probably not as intense or", "72:45", "meditative but there's something like", "72:47", "you know what people are like I don't", "72:48", "know why anyone wants a gun I'm like", "72:50", "I've ever shot one", "72:52", "really I mean I don't own a gun I mean I", "72:54", "live in New York City

pulled that I did", "74:57", "I was like wait but I like my passive", "74:59", "mentality it cost more money you know is", "75:02", "so the thought is that the NRA has", "75:05", "made it more easy for crazy people to", "75:08", "access these guns and so we that's what", "75:10", "it is it's like hot away from them yeah", "75:12", "the idea that like we can't raise the", "75:14", "age to 21 well

then", "76:23", "next next class yeah I'd like to own a", "76:25", "shotgun all right get a Class B shotgun", "76:27", "license take the class they'd think fine", "76:28", "and then you get to like the ar-15 level", "76:31", "and they let go and now you have an", "76:33", "instructor looking at the guy like this", "76:34", "guy doesn't seem low you know it's got a", "76:38", "little bit like of a dead eye here you", "76:39", "know like if you we don't got that maybe", "76:41", "like maybe we double check this guy or", "76:43", "whatever you know like you can you can", "76:45", "get a sense

"92:30", "they just stayed with the Buffalo but", "92:31", "they also kept their numbers down", "92:32", "because you know if there's several", "92:34", "hundred Native Americans or how many in",

fuck", "165:21", "out of here bitch can shoot three hours", "165:23", "at the same time they'll all be slow as", "165:25", "shit he's got some mystical bow doesn't", "165:29", "make sense it's too much power so the", "165:31", "power must all be in the projects like a", "165:33", "tech bow you know it's so stupid it's", "165:35", "all tech the whole thing is stupid", "165:37", "because he's got like these missile tips", "165:39", "on the end of this slow bullshit ass bow", "165:41", "that's a slow ass bow like it's a slow", "165:47", "no he's on the right side because he's", "165:49", "shooting where is this thing it's on", "165:52", "he's pulling back with oh yeah right on", "165:54", "the right but some people do do that", "165:57", "they do it or not yeah if you learn it", "165:59", "that way you can do it that way it seems", "166:01", "weird it does but on a compound bow you", "166:04", "would definitely have it on the other", "166:05", "side but I've seen people do it that way", "166:07", "the thing is with a riser like a one of", "166:11", "these bow risers a recurve bow riser", "166:13", "it's kind of a different thing because", "166:14", "your arrow is making contact with the", "166:17", "riser as well there's like way less", "166:18", "accuracy with one of those things huh", "166:20", "especially that traditional kind of a", "166:23", "setup the way he has like if you look at", "166:26", "archers in the Olympics they have a", "166:28", "bunch of different classes that they", "166:30", "compete in and when you have an arrow", "166:33", "that has to brush up against the side of", "166:35", "your bow like that like those", "166:37", "traditional all those are the hardest to", "166:39", "really develop real accuracy with it", "166:42", "requires a lot of feel man you got to", "166:45", "really practice with that thing and know", "166:48", "that you're pulling the bow back exactly", "166:50", "the same distance every time because", "166:52", "just if you pull it back an inch more", "166:53", "it'll have like a bunch more feet per", "166:55", "second power just go higher or lower if", "166:59", "you don't pull it back far enough yeah", "167:01", "yeah he seems to be doing that in every", "167:03", "picture I'm sure they trained him and", "167:04", "I'm sure some people do do it that way", "167:07", "and it looks like in some of these", "167:08", "things he's shooting left-handed okay", "167:12", "well then it's the right way so he's", "167:14", "shooting left-handed that's why it's on", "167:15", "the other side but I felt like on the", "167:16", "other side it was his right arm you know", "167:18", "Pitts his left arm okay", "167:19", "duh that's why how did I not notice that", "167:22", "yeah he's got his left arm up so he's", "167:25", "drawing back the bow with his left arm", "167:27", "that's why it's on the other side but I", "167:28", "have seen people even people who are", "167:30", "right-handed on a traditional bow but", "167:33", "maybe it was like one of those stick", "167:34", "bows not like a traditional bow like a", "167:38", "but if you if you were pulling back with", "167:41", "your right arm it would still be on the", "167:42", "outside of the bow right if you were", "167:44", "doing it with your right arm a compound", "167:46", "bow it's on the other side so if I'm", "167:48", "holding it with my left side the arrows", "167:50", "gonna be on the left side right I think", "167:53", "on some traditional bows and I'm talking", "167:54", "out of my ass a little bit I don't know", "167:56", "too much about traditional bows but I", "167:57", "think there are some guys who put the", "167:59", "arrow on the other side and I think that", "168:01", "was actually a part of that lars", "168:02", "Anderson's video where is neck the neck", "168:05", "the guys name the guy was the crazy", "168:07", "arrow expert shoots all those arrows at", "168:09", "the same time", "168:10", "think that was one of the things that he", "168:11", "was saying was to have it on this side", "168:14", "yes that's exactly it was well he was", "168:16", "saying to have it on that side because", "168:18", "it makes it easier to put on to the", "168:19", "string if he's grabbing the arrow and", "168:21", "just throwing it on the swing League she", "168:22", "ain't going over the top to the other", "168:24", "side right yeah that's what it was", "168:26", "look at all these guys they have it on", "168:29", "the left-hand side all these guys have", "168:31", "it on the left-hand side it's an", "168:32", "opposite pull back with the right and", "168:34", "one on the Left yes so he's got it", "168:36", "that's how he has it that's how most", "168:39", "people have it and this is like what", "168:41", "he's got in his hands right here this is", "168:43", "that was a olympic target bo so what", "168:48", "he's doing is doing it instead of going", "168:50", "around all the way around to the left", "168:52", "he's explaining how much wasted motion", "168:53", "is in that gotcha and so instead he's", "168:57", "saying you go to the same side and he", "168:59", "shows all these images of people with", "169:00", "arrows to the same side they all have it", "169:03", "on the same side and it makes sense that", "169:05", "would be so much easier and quicker to", "169:06", "do it that way totally makes sense yeah", "169:10", "completely makes sense", "169:11", "I think this for accuracy I would have", "169:15", "to talk to my friend John Dudley about", "169:16", "this he's a master archery instructor I", "169:19", "bet there's something to do with torque", "169:21", "but again that's another thing like if", "169:23", "you just shoot with the same bow the", "169:25", "same weight arrows over and over and", "169:27", "over again with that it's sort of like", "169:28", "you know how you know how to throw a", "169:29", "rock like if you ball perfect example if", "169:32", "you see if you have a baseball there's a", "169:34", "tree that's like 30 feet away 40 feet", "169:36", "away you know how far or how hard you", "169:39", "have to throw the ball to hit that tree", "169:41", "right you know you can actually like get", "169:42", "pretty close like that yeah you get", "169:45", "pretty close to a spot in that tree", "169:46", "we're just throwing it well it's because", "169:48", "you've done it a bunch of times if you", "169:50", "played catch with a bunch of people you", "169:51", "kind of know what to do with a baseball", "169:53", "right well it's the same thing with a", "169:54", "bow and arrow especially that kind that", "169:56", "style of where you don't have a sight", "169:58", "that you're looking through you're just", "169:59", "pulling back you kind of know where the", "170:01", "arrows gonna go you just kind of know", "170:03", "because you do it a lot of feel yeah but", "170:04", "you have to do it every time you have to", "170:06", "bring it back exactly the same spot of", "170:07", "your face every time because if you go", "170:09", "here it's gonna go different it's gonna", "170:11", "go further or if you go in front of your", "170:13", "face you don't pull it back all the way", "170:14", "it's gonna go shorter right but in some", "170:16", "cases you want to be doing that so you", "170:18", "just have to no no you never want to be", "170:20", "having it with the", "170:22", "different with a different form you", "170:24", "always want to pull it back to the same", "170:26", "spot so another worry mat different", "170:27", "positions so in other words though then", "170:29", "the range of the bow is the same every", "170:31", "time every time yeah that's the only way", "170:32", "you're ever gonna know it's gonna kill", "170:34", "go if you really want to go well you can", "170:36", "lift it up but you're just aiming in a", "170:37", "different spot but you always want to", "170:38", "pull it back further no okay I always", "170:40", "want to pull it back to the exact same", "170:41", "spot what's called the compound bow it's", "170:44", "actually called the wall okay a place we", "170:45", "can't pull it back any further it just", "170:47", "locks in place when the arrow is fully", "170:49", "drawn and then you just release it yeah", "170:51", "so release is hard that's the thing I", "170:53", "think that's it - like now smack against", "170:55", "your arm it's just a forum issue yeah", "170:57", "once you learn how to do with the right", "170:58", "form let go fast no it's where you're", "171:00", "standing if you're standing like this", "171:02", "like totally sideways the string is", "171:04", "gonna hit your arm you're supposed to", "171:05", "open up more so you're drawn back like", "171:07", "this gotcha so there's space so the", "171:09", "arrow it's very rarely do your forum get", "171:12", "hit by a string super rare with someone", "171:14", "who fires a bow I'll know is how to do", "171:16", "it yeah but like those old timey dudes I", "171:18", "mean they're just firing arrows in the", "171:19", "middle of fucking Warren shit and that's", "171:21", "why they have those big bands across", "171:23", "there for armor to protect themselves in", "171:24", "the strings yeah and they had like crazy", "171:26", "powerful pose that you got to

develop a toughness on your feet for", "179:09", "sure mine aren't there at all like I'm a", "179:11", "bitch like on the way down especially", "179:13", "because I'm going down deep", "179:15", "to this canyon and I'm running back up", "179:16", "and out and when I'm going there's some", "179:18", "ups at the end of it - and it's almost", "179:20", "like a bowl but when I get to the sharp",

feet", "179:30", "toughen up but for sure they've gotten", "179:32", "stronger yeah they've gotten way", "179:33", "stronger they feel different it sounds", "179:36", "so stupid I'm listening to myself I know", "179:38", "it sounds stupid but when I'm walking", "179:39", "around my feet feel different like", "179:41", "they're feeling the ground more right", "179:43", "like they used to be
