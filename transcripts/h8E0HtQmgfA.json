["00:00", "ha ha ha hello freak bitches so before", "00:03", "they started modifying genes how did", "00:05", "they select like say how do they because", "00:07", "before any genetic modifications were", "00:09", "done in laboratories they had turned", "00:11", "this geo sitting what I say a toc toc a", "00:15", "or maize as we used to call it right", "00:17", "that was the indian word for even know", "00:19", "you had Carter that commercial yeah", "00:21", "that's me yes yeah well they mazes kind", "00:24", "of a general term for everything from", "00:26", "field corn which is what we think about", "00:28", "which is fed to animals right eighty", "00:30", "percent of GM crops go to animal feed", "00:32", "right and we differentiate that versus", "00:35", "what is typically eaten by humans which", "00:37", "is usually sweet corn varieties so how", "00:40", "did they turn it before there was any", "00:42", "genetic modifications done in", "00:43", "laboratories how did they turn that corn", "00:46", "into what we now which is delicious and", "00:49", "sweet and you put butter on it it's", "00:50", "fantastic oh sure how do they do that", "00:52", "yeah actually but it was all just random", "00:54", "mutations DNA random yeah DNA", "00:57", "replication is a sloppy process and", "00:59", "funny things happen when you from", "01:02", "environment so in the process of", "01:04", "replication of DNA itself you can make", "01:06", "errors cosmic radiation just chemicals", "01:10", "in our environment natural chemicals", "01:12", "that are out there can induce changes in", "01:14", "DNA and these kind of mutations", "01:16", "sometimes very rarely result in a change", "01:19", "in the plant that's beneficial and at", "01:22", "least or at least from a human", "01:23", "perspective so in all the plants that", "01:25", "we've had all the plants that we have", "01:26", "the significant amount of change has", "01:29", "come from random mutations that change", "01:32", "genes in ways we don't understand pieces", "01:35", "of DNA that get up out of the genome and", "01:37", "sit down somewhere else randomly they do", "01:39", "this all the time viruses and the plants", "01:42", "that get into the genome and sit down in", "01:44", "places that we have no idea where so", "01:47", "genetic modification is something that's", "01:49", "ongoing in constant and a factor in", "01:52", "every genome including our own and so", "01:55", "what we're seeing today is just the the", "01:58", "long term effect that of humans who've", "02:00", "been able to put all the good traits in", "02:01", "one place so when you see those tomatoes", "02:05", "that are in the supermarket that are", "02:06", "pale and you could play basketball with", "02:09", "them those hard tomatoes and then you", "02:11", "compare them to like heirloom tomatoes", "02:12", "the", "02:13", "only difference between those two is", "02:15", "that someone had found some tomatoes", "02:18", "that had grown extra firm and selected", "02:21", "those and use the seeds from those to", "02:24", "create more similar tomatoes and only", "02:27", "selected those right so you at you frame", "02:29", "to cool things here so heirloom what is", "02:31", "an heirloom in an heirloom is a tomato", "02:33", "with outstanding eating qualities that", "02:35", "can't work in production commercially", "02:37", "because it's too mushy it's too mushy", "02:39", "they don't last long and it break down", "02:40", "but on the other hand so this is what", "02:42", "the problem is with our food when you", "02:44", "talk about tomatoes strawberries", "02:45", "blueberries things that these are", "02:47", "non-gmo by the way there's no GMO", "02:49", "tomatoes or strawberries not at all", "02:51", "people would say there are the problem", "02:53", "is is that plant breeding over the last", "02:55", "50 years or say over the last 100 years", "02:59", "the objectives of the breeders has been", "03:02", "bigger fruit uniformity big yield", "03:05", "disease resistance nothing about flavor", "03:08", "and aroma so to meet production", "03:11", "characteristics which is what we've been", "03:13", "selecting for breeders have been looking", "03:16", "for these kind of characteristics that", "03:17", "don't involve the consumer and so our", "03:20", "decline in the flavors and the quality", "03:22", "of fruits and vegetables is directly", "03:24", "related to the mass breeding not", "03:27", "anything to do with GMO so when you say", "03:30", "genetic modified in that in those terms", "03:33", "they are kind of genetically modified", "03:35", "but they're not modified in terms of", "03:37", "being in the laboratory and human beings", "03:39", "doing some funky stuff with jeans", "03:41", "they're sort of modified almost", "03:43", "naturally and just selected for those", "03:46", "modifications exactly and some of the", "03:48", "things that we've selected for have been", "03:50", "the ones that didn't kill us when we ate", "03:52", "them or the things that didn't make a", "03:54", "poison that or something that tasted", "03:56", "horrible plants make lots of funky", "03:58", "compounds and so this was an opportunity", "04:01", "for so what we've seen in our stores", "04:03", "right now is the residue of thousands of", "04:06", "years of human selection and we can call", "04:08", "it genetic modification if we want to", "04:10", "but we can differentiate it from what we", "04:12", "do in the laboratory which is now we can", "04:14", "call adding a transgene where a", "04:16", "transgenesis moving a gene from one", "04:19", "background of genetics to another via", "04:21", "laboratory and these selections that", "04:26", "people have", "04:27", "moaned about and I have as well it's", "04:30", "horrible when you get a sandwich and has", "04:31", "a pale tomato on it because they just", "04:33", "taste awful this so there's there's no", "04:36", "science involved in me of that other", "04:37", "than selection there's no there's no", "04:39", "there's no like injection of some alien", "04:42", "sort of genetics into those things alien", "04:46", "to the plant no there's no there's no", "04:47", "syringes nothing like that and actually", "04:50", "you know it is more an art than a", "04:52", "science being a plant breeder is the", "04:54", "most kick-ass career these days and has", "04:57", "been for a long time plant breeding is", "04:59", "essentially inventing the next", "05:01", "generation of food and all we're talking", "05:02", "about is mixing pollen from things that", "05:05", "maybe normally wouldn't cross together", "05:07", "like something that nature would never", "05:09", "cross but you got this cool tomato from", "05:12", "Europe that has great qualities and we", "05:14", "can mix it with this great production", "05:16", "quality tomato from that grows in", "05:17", "Florida where nothing else can grow and", "05:19", "now you mix these two together and you", "05:21", "get this beautiful tomato that works", "05:23", "well in everybody's garden that's where", "05:25", "we're going now but that's not GMO", "05:27", "that's just using other types of", "05:30", "technology to facilitate this net dis", "05:32", "breeding process that breeders do but I", "05:35", "think masculine

is a bad feeling so they think of", "06:07", "competition and competitive people as", "06:09", "being negative okay so that's what", "06:11", "that's my worry about the feminization", "06:15",

we", "06:36", "all have is with assholes yeah that is", "06:40", "the problem", "06:40", "across the board whether it's women or", "06:42", "its men when you see like these crazy", "06:44", "radical feminists who attack speakers", "06:47", "because they you know want to support", "06:50", "men's rights in divorce court and", "06:53", "whatever the fucking reason is that the", "06:55", "really aggressive like this is", "06:56", "archetypal video of this super", "06:59", "aggressive feminist outside of this", "07:01", "thing in Toronto and she's got red hair", "07:02", "and she's screaming at people like what", "07:05", "she wants and what she doesn't want for", "07:06", "men when they can shut the fuck up and", "07:08", "you know and and she's telling people in", "07:10", "the honest shut the fuck up look the", "07:12", "people that that exist like that then", "07:15", "they become the problem the problem is", "07:17", "not like the idea that women deserve", "07:19", "everything that men deserve and that we", "07:20", "should have equal treatment by law the", "07:23", "problem is assholes yeah his assholes", "07:26", "representing a point of view that I", "07:27", "probably

transgenders", "07:55", "or whatever the fucking is as soon as", "07:57", "you stop treating that person as like an", "08:00", "come at them from a totally even spot", "08:02", "then you're the
