"10:35", "muscle guys tell me what you think okay", "10:38", "I was trying to explain that yeah I know", "10:43", "you have to have known guys like this", "10:45", "that are naturally naturally just more", "10:48", "muscular yes more built and they look", "10:52", "like they lift weights and work", "10:54", "but they don't write guys like you know", "10:56", "I know this guy Herschel Walker sure", "11:00", "outstanding athlete you know and both", "11:04", "Jackson for example these guys fantastic", "11:07", "athletes muscular very muscle guys but I", "11:12", "think if you were born born must good", "11:16", "there's a difference in a guy that goes", "11:19", "into gym and works out three four hours", "11:21", "a day and adds muscle and he started out", "11:24", "you know normal guy but these guys if", "11:26", "you were born with that muscle then you", "11:28", "were born with the cardiovascular system", "11:29", "the lungs and whatnot to support that", "11:32", "muscle and it's yeah take it way way", "11:35", "back to guys like Jim Thorpe okay head", "11:39", "and shoulders above all the other", "11:40", "athletes of his era because he was born", "11:43", "that way so he was born the good Lord", "11:46", "give us the cardio pastors in the lungs", "11:48", "and everything too you know to go along", "11:51", "with that extra muscle that we were born", "11:54", "with in some cases in some cases now I", "11:57", "thought that you were making a blanket", "11:59", "statement and it covered a lot of you", "12:02", "know the all muscular guys are gonna", "12:04", "tire out because of the extra muscle and", "12:07", "I disagree because I think if they were", "12:09", "born with that muscle then they were", "12:11", "born with the support system to support", "12:13", "them us I think there's a lot of logic", "12:15", "to that I think it makes sense but I do", "12:17", "think that if you have a certain amount", "12:19", "of muscle like there's just no way you", "12:22", "are going to be you're gonna have the", "12:24", "the same cardiovascular capabilities to", "12:26", "someone that's bit like a marathon", "12:27", "runner you're not gonna have the", "12:29", "marathon runner has there's advantages", "12:30", "and disadvantages I think to all sorts", "12:32", "of body types especially when it comes", "12:34", "to fighting there's a big advantage to", "12:36", "being powerful scary look at you look at", "12:38", "a guy like would leave gosh shit you", "12:40", "know like you know you can't stop him", "12:42", "like the only thing that's gonna stop", "12:43", "him is him getting tired or you got to", "12:45", "catch him when he's coming in right he's", "12:46", "just faster than you stronger than you", "12:48", "so there's there's benefits to that but", "12:50", "I think that when it comes to like", "12:53", "there's no never gonna see a marathon", "12:54", "runner that's built like Woodley they", "12:56", "just don't exist so even though he has", "12:58", "the the cardiovascular system and the", "13:01", "support system that's designed for that", "13:03", "build that he's born with he's still", "13:06", "never going to be able to compete", "13:07", "with like an elite triathlete cuz then", "13:09", "your body has to be smaller you have to", "13:12", "have less oxygen requirements less", "13:14", "weight that you're carrying around", "13:15", "there's just no there's no way but", "13:17", "there's benefits there's certain it's a", "13:19", "real it's a real like balancing act I", "13:21", "think at MMA because you have to have", "13:23", "some muscle you have to be able to get", "13:24", "guys off you you have to be able to get", "13:26", "up from the bottom you have to be able", "13:27", "to explode you have to be able to close", "13:30", "the distance quickly there's a lot of", "13:31", "like real benefits to being powerful but", "13:33", "then there's you know it's it's like a", "13:35", "it's a balancing act you know yeah you", "13:38", "right but here we go it's not just", "13:45", "muscle you don't see marathon runners", "13:51", "that are you know 250 pounds either they", "13:54", "can be fat smooth butterball and and", "13:57", "still you know not it's not because of", "14:00", "the musculature that they think you know", "14:03", "just bigger guy period would have a hard", "14:06", "time being a marathon for sure so the", "14:08", "the musculature that's what we have a", "14:10", "little I don't think it's the", "14:13", "musculature because that muscles here if", "14:15", "you're born if you're just born more", "14:19", "muscular and then little kids in grade", "14:22", "school and you see some of the kids are", "14:24", "gonna have a six-pack they're gonna just", "14:26", "be built better than the other kids yeah", "14:29", "and then if they're too if you're at", "14:31", "that muscle you were born with that", "14:32", "muscle in my opinion it's just my", "14:34", "opinion joke if you were born with that", "14:37", "muscle in that musculature it's not you", "14:39", "know it's not gonna be detrimental in", "14:41", "your system is made for you know it's a", "14:44", "good little major system able and it's a", "14:47", "bit but you're right you won't see", "14:50", "anybody built like Chiron will be", "14:52", "running in the New York Marathon or when", "14:54", "in the New York and running for hours", "15:04", "and 20 minutes really yeah yeah you want", "15:10", "you right but I think that that's just a", "15:13", "bigger person period yeah", "15:14", "you know how they defined or the", "15:17", "definition in a musculature you know I I", "15:20", "know boss root and I talked to boss", "15:22", "routing a little bit about it and I say", "15:24", "man boss you a bit like a fucking statue", "15:27", "and shit and he you know he was quick", "15:29", "but I don't live way to and I said you", "15:33", "prove it my point right if you were born", "15:38", "that way you didn't go in the gym and", "15:40", "lift weight", "15:42", "he proved my point that's right you", "15:44", "don't you know you didn't get that", "15:47", "muscle from going in the gym and pumping", "15:50", "iron and get you were born that way and", "15:52", "so well he was born that way but boss", "15:55", "also does a tremendous amount of plyos", "15:57", "like a lot of explosive stuff like all", "16:00", "of his bad work you ever see boss hit", "16:01", "the bag yes and everything he does he", "16:09", "does like with a thousand percent effort", "16:11", "so you know his workouts like he would", "16:14", "tell me that the way he would work out", "16:15", "was when he would prepare for a five", "16:18", "minute round when he would start to get", "16:19", "in shape he would go as hard as he could", "16:22", "for like a minute and then like be", "16:25", "exhausted and then he would work himself", "16:26", "up to a minute and a half then work", "16:28", "himself up to two minutes and then by", "16:30", "the end of his training camp he'd go", "16:31", "five minutes full clip I'm like that's", "16:33", "fucking crazy method but in you know", "16:40", "against that his boss's body started to", "16:43", "deteriorate because he's so goddamn", "16:44", "tough like he has no cartilage in his", "16:46", "knees his needs a completely shot he", "16:48", "kept shooting cortisone on all of his", "16:50", "joints like whenever he'd have injuries", "16:51", "so his joints are all fucked up it has", "16:53", "got tendinitis everywhere just his mind", "16:56", "was too
