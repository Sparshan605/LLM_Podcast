"11:45", "hospitalizations to two for ICU and 0.1", "11:52", "to 0.25 now you got to think those", "11:54", "people have pre-existing conditions just", "11:56", "looking at those numbers 45 to 54 that's", "12:00", "my age group 429 cases less for some", "12:03", "weird reason 21 to 28 hospitalization", "12:08", "five point four to ten point for ICU one", "12:12", "point four to two point six fatality", "12:14", "again", "12:15", "you gotta think those people have", "12:16", "pre-existing conditions and it gets all", "12:18", "the way up to really old let's go to 85", "12:21", "Plus as

twenty nine ICU fatalities ten to", "12:40", "twenty seven so the vast majority of", "12:43", "fatalities you look at in people between", "12:45", "75 and 84 which is four point three to", "12:47", "ten point five and then 85 Plus which is", "12:50", "ten point four to twenty seven point", "12:53", "three so it's it's really obviously not", "12:55", "good for really old people it looks like",

it carbon", "32:01", "dioxide and you have a chemical scrubber", "32:04", "that scrubs out the carbon dioxide so it", "32:08", "goes in one side and it goes through", "32:09", "this loop so there's no bubbles you can", "32:10", "stand to water for a long time I think", "32:11", "you talked to Trevor about it but yeah", "32:12", "this stuff he was diving so you're what", "32:14", "the dive buddy and will do or they will", "32:18", "still do now like long distance", "32:20", "underwater navigation and you would", "32:22", "think there's some high speed computer", "32:23", "you have a depth gauge a stopwatch and a", "32:26", "compass and that's your entertainment", "32:28", "for the sometimes four hours that you're", "32:30", "underwater mind you only one of the two", "32:32", "people is holding this the other person", "32:34", "has zero entertainment for that time", "32:36", "period because you're just along for the", "32:38", "ride as the buddy so you're holding on", "32:39", "to their elbow to pinch them to make", "32:41", "sure you're still there but most of the", "32:43", "time but if you're the driver the person", "32:45", "navigating your buddy will stay on one", "32:47", "side of you and you know that you're", "32:48", "there cuz they'll check in every once in", "32:50", "a while and squeeze your elbow and I had", "32:52", "on more than one occasion diving in the", "32:55",

side", "33:17", "and you'll get slammed by something on", "33:19", "your left and you'll just see it go off", "33:20", "in the phosphorescence the question is", "33:23", "do you look or do you just keep your", "33:25", "head down and keep going what do you do", "33:28", "I just kept my head down and kept going", "33:30", "because you can't do anything I couldn't", "33:31", "do anything and if I had looked and I've", "33:33", "hit him in a shark I would have probably", "33:34", "killed myself just doing a nuclear", "33:37", "submarine porpoise hanging out of the", "33:38", "water so what do you think it was", "33:40", "probably a sea lion or a dolphin or it", "33:44", "could even damn near been a shark but it", "33:46", "happened to me on more than one occasion", "33:48", "and more and

attack that's amazing it's not", "34:07", "amazing well I mean the stats are on", "34:09", "your side yeah but still you would think", "34:12", "one guy like I know guys who've been", "34:14", "struck by lightning what your odds are", "34:17", "lightning strike versus shark I bet it's", "34:19", "way higher lightning strike if you're", "34:21", "outside yeah then if you're in the water", "34:23", "I know of them cancelling dives because", "34:26", "there was shark activity in the area but", "34:28", "I don't know of a single guy has", "34:29", "actually had an interaction where they", "34:31", "got bit wow that's pretty impressive", "34:34", "I would imagine there would be a few", "34:36", "losses over the years well if you think", "34:38", "well but most of the diving I did down", "34:41",

the corner I it's", "35:20", "like yeah that didn't happen let's just", "35:21", "keep going for hours that's about the", "35:24", "longest I've been underwater yeah", "35:25", "exhaustion dive on a

see", "35:56", "people do the nuclear submarine stop", "35:59", "ripping their mouthpiece out because", "36:00", "it's called a caustic cocktail there's a", "36:03", "there's one-way valves in each of

because if", "36:14", "there was no one-way valve you know what", "36:16", "I mean the oxygen would flow through the", "36:18", "system without being able to recharge", "36:19", "because if you inhale enough it'll give", "36:22", "you another hit of pure oxygen and it", "36:23", "can continue that cycle mm-hmm but so if", "36:26", "the cannister will start to fill up and", "36:28", "you can hear it too", "36:29", "like every after every dive you will", "36:32", "dump you maintain your own gear but", "36:34", "you'll dump out the cannister and the", "36:37", "chemical it'll turn at least the stuff", "36:39", "that I was using when I was in it'll", "36:40", "turn like a purplish color as it's the", "36:42", "effectiveness is starting to reduce you", "36:45", "can actually do more than one die with", "36:46", "it as you open the container up and you", "36:48", "make sure that the chemicals are okay", "36:49", "and then you tilt it over and on every", "36:51", "dive water starts coming out of it and", "36:54", "you can hear it on dives too it'll start", "36:55", "gurgling a little bit like as you're", "36:58", "inhaling oh no oh it's and again you can", "37:03", "spend time worrying about that or you", "37:05", "can just drive on and deal with if it", "37:08", "becomes an issue you can deal with it at", "37:09", "that time what do you do if you've got", "37:11", "an issue you have to get to the surface", "37:13", "it's so when what you do you got to get", "37:16", "fresh air you need to wash your mouth", "37:17", "out you need to get to a higher level of", "37:18", "care so if you are two hours into a four", "37:22", "hour swim yep with a rebreather and you", "37:24", "pop your head off the surface and you're", "37:25", "gagging what do you do there's gonna be",

pretty", "37:35", "robust network of people that are up", "37:37", "there for safety so the dive has been", "37:39", "planned you've probably already", "37:40", "coordinated with you know where the",

a", "37:49", "prime", "37:49", "secondary and tertiary medical plan and", "37:52", "I think I forget what it was but I think", "37:54", "it was you know one dive soup per maybe", "37:57", "four dive pairs and you dive with buoys", "38:00", "in training so there's boats that are up", "38:02", "top that are not only are they there to", "38:05", "help in case an emergency would come up", "38:06",

know you wave your hand and the boat", "38:22", "will come over and they're gonna get you", "38:23", "to a corpsman which is you know the", "38:24", "medical personnel on the Navy side of", "38:26",

"projectile vomiting it doesn't happen", "38:33", "that often but every dive you dip you", "38:36", "dip that thing over and the water starts", "38:38", "coming out of it oh yeah Jesus Christ", "38:42", "it's just crazy that it does work that", "38:44", "you can breathe underwater with no", "38:46", "bubbles it works well works really well", "38:48", "yeah most the time you're limited by the", "38:50", "amount of oxygen in the cylinder not the", "38:53", "effectiveness of the chemical scrubber", "38:55", "itself how long is it supposed to last", "38:57", "for who", "38:59", "I do not know off the top of my head but", "39:01", "you an exhaustion dive on a dragger for", "39:04", "me you could go somewhere between three", "39:06", "and a half to four hours Wow which is", "39:08", "just it's mind-numbing that's crazy you", "39:10", "could just breathe into that thing", "39:12", "mmm it's super quiet the only noise that", "39:14", "it makes is when you have a demand valve", "39:17", "that kicks in it'll give you a hit of", "39:18", "that pure oxygen that's what it sounds", "39:20", "like and then other that's pure that's", "39:22", "what I'm saying you can hear so much", "39:23", "more you hear all the crustaceans down", "39:25", "there and all the clicking you can sneak", "39:27", "up on animals because you're not making", "39:28", "as much noise it seems like it would be", "39:30", "a good thing to wear if you were scuba", "39:32", "diving or you were spearfishing rather", "39:34", "it's limited by the depth because you", "39:36", "take oxygen down to depth that's we're", "39:38", "gonna get the o2 toxicity issues so on", "39:40", "those dives we're talking 20 feet to the", "39:42", "surface as well that's it oh won't work", "39:46", "no unless there's awesome spearfishing", "39:49", "in tiny feet I heard spearfishing is the", "39:51", "shit everybody that's done it says it's", "39:53", "amazing it's like hunting underwater", "39:54", "I'll never be able to tell you because", "39:56", "I'm not gonna fall in the fucking water", "39:59", "well it's understandable you did your", "40:02", "time dude I didn't know I was listening", "40:03", "to your podcast I didn't know that you", "40:05", "were involved in the rescue of Jessica", "40:07", "Lynch that was the second target that we", "40:09", "hit and the first invasion of my rack", "40:11", "that's crazy it was an odd series of", "40:14", "events the you know we went over there I", "40:17", "had just finished the selection process", "40:20", "for the East Coast command and they", "40:21", "actually there are will be the best way", "40:26", "to describe it there are multiple", "40:29", "squadrons in side of that command all", "40:32", "tasked with they're all have the same", "40:33", "skill set but you need multiple so one", "40:36", "can be on deployment while another one", "40:37", "is training and the other one is resting", "40:39", "you want to get into a you know a", "40:40", "rotation cycle so at the end of", "40:43", "selection an X number of people get", "40:45", "partitioned off to each one of those and", "40:47", "it takes time to get up to speed because", "40:48", "the selection tactics and the way that", "40:50", "you train or they're good but you get", "40:54", "better as you were working with the guys", "40:56", "with more experience specifically the", "40:58", "real-world experience and so they pulled", "41:00", "us out of selection about a month early", "41:02", "and sent us over to augment the karzai", "41:04", "detail in Afghanistan at the very tail", "41:06", "end I mean nothing happened we basically", "41:08", "you know you're a deterrent at that", "41:09", "point and it's one of the worst missions", "41:10", "because you can't it's very reactive", "41:12", "security detail stuff you can't really", "41:14", "do anything until somebody else does", "41:16", "something so you're already behind the", "41:17", "power curve it's my least favorite", "41:18", "mission set I think but we came back", "41:21", "from that and then the Intel started", "41:23", "kicking off for Iraq and they sent us", "41:26", "over to Saudi Arabia and we were there", "41:28", "for probably somewhere between 7 to 10", "41:31", "days that's where I watched Bush give", "41:33", "the speech no sonam Hussein has I think", "41:34", "it was 24 hours to comply or turn", "41:36", "himself in whatever it was and we had", "41:41", "already taken a look at we knew before", "41:43", "going over there that there were two or", "41:44", "three objectives that we were gonna look", "41:47", "at so we had already basically planned", "41:48", "missions that we were gonna do while we", "41:50", "were in Virginia Beach", "41:52", "we were planning for stuff in Iraq so we", "41:53", "continued the planning in Saudi Arabia", "41:56", "and the number one the first target we", "41:58", "hit was the number one chembio target in", "42:00", "Iraq so to do that you have to get all", "42:02", "your shit on this it's called MOPP gear", "42:04", "mission oriented protective posture it's", "42:07", "like a chemical chem bio suit gas mask", "42:09", "which compounds a lot of stuff you have", "42:12", "all your normal shit on anyway like", "42:14", "there's guys carrying quickie saws in a", "42:16", "hazmat suit with a gas mask on breathing", "42:19", "through a blower on their back", "42:20", "overworking the blower and it's amazing", "42:23", "how close to suffocation I've actually", "42:24", "come inside of those gas mass it's the", "42:26", "worst feeling ever like that you're", "42:28", "sucking so hard for air that the mask is", "42:30", "like sting cuz you're not supposed to be", "42:32", "physically exerting yourself while", "42:33", "you're wearing that thing there's a it's", "42:35", "just it's harder it's me like putting", "42:37", "them because there's a canister on the", "42:39", "side how much weight are you carrying", "42:40", "around in those days it was probably", "42:43", "bodyweight plus eighty two hundred", "42:44", "pounds Jesus Christ and that was about", "42:46", "average and it trimmed down after that", "42:48", "because the actual amount of real world", "42:50", "experience at that time was low and it", "42:52", "drastically increased so you'd be like", "42:55", "you know I think I need this pocket and", "42:57", "then you wouldn't need it for a month I", "42:58", "need to get rid of this goddamn pocket", "42:59", "because it carries sweat and like", "43:01", "backpack hunters", "43:02", "same kind of thing oh yeah the gear that", "43:04", "I wore towards the end was substantially", "43:06", "different than the gear that I ward", "43:07", "towards the beginning I trimmed I mean I", "43:08", "think I probably had ten magazines on me", "43:10", "like that first target I think the last", "43:12", "appointment I did I would carry four", "43:13", "four one in the gun and no pistol so", "43:17", "things changed over time but this just", "43:19", "for weight just for weight and for", "43:20", "ability to move cuz then I would need", "43:22", "less food and I would need less water", "43:23", "and I'd actually be mobile but on this", "43:26", "target so is a four hour helicopter", "43:28", "right in we're sitting there we have all", "43:30", "of our MOPP gear on but not our masks", "43:32", "and we're doing a mid-air refuel on a", "43:35", "c-130 so you had a forty seven double", "43:37", "you know the big double my propeller so", "43:40", "it'd be rotor blades on top of", "43:42", "helicopter they're hooked up next to a", "43:44", "c-130 in-flight refueling missile goes", "43:46", "underneath the c-130 is like see you", "43:48", "boys later comes out and it like the", "43:52", "c-130 bailed when the missile flew fuck", "43:55", "yeah I don't blame him for that either", "43:56", "they're literally a flying fuel tank but", "43:59", "I think they had gotten enough gas and", "44:00", "we had to hit the tanker on the way back", "44:01", "as well but so you're just sitting there", "44:03", "waiting for three and a half you know", "44:05", "three and three-quarter hours and about", "44:07", "ten minutes out you start getting your", "44:08", "gas masks and stuff long you get a stuff", "44:10", "that drape and you know night-vision", "44:13", "goggles have you ever looked through a", "44:14", "pair yeah", "44:15", "your field of view sucks it's terrible", "44:17", "it's weird which is why you notice when", "44:19", "people are actually using them they will", "44:21", "all constantly have movement", "44:22", "in their head because they're increasing", "44:24", "their field of view and up and down and", "44:26", "that's when you can orient them to a", "44:28", "good offset to your eye", "44:29", "now imagine putting a gas mask in", "44:32", "between your eye and the lens of the", "44:34", "night vision goggle oh Jesus", "44:36", "so you're taking already a limited field", "44:38", "of view and putting it into a soda straw", "44:40", "so in mind you this is the first combat", "44:43", "target I've ever been on so and you're", "44:46", "18 oh no this one T - no I went through", "44:49", "how old are you me 42 I was in my at the", "44:51", "time this was in 2003 I was 25 okay 25", "44:56", "but you you enlisted when you were", "44:58", "really young seventeen junior in high", "44:59", "school I signed the paperwork when I was", "45:01", "in junior in high school least I didn't", "45:02", "you still gotta graduate and then you", "45:04", "know continue on but and I was in like", "45:07", "the third or fourth forty-seven that", "45:10", "went in so you finally get all your", "45:11", "stuff on you know and you have a blower", "45:13", "on your back so there's ways that you", "45:14", "can help the canister if you just have", "45:17", "the canister on your mask it's a lot", "45:19", "like breathing through a few straws", "45:21", "shoved in your mouth if you maintain a", "45:23", "loan of heart rate and you're totally", "45:25", "chill you're fine", "45:26", "but as your heart rate goes up and your", "45:28", "demand you know for oxygen goes up", "45:29", "you're really limited so they have you", "45:31", "know you can put them on your back it's", "45:32", "a blower it's a battery-powered blower", "45:34", "that will basically push air into the", "45:36", "mask and it gives you I would say more", "45:38", "buffer space it's like almost like a", "45:39", "positive pressure and if you're not", "45:41", "doing much it's actually really nice", "45:42", "it's just GM and aired in your face and", "45:44", "it works well unless you put your weapon", "45:47", "sling over the top of that tube which is", "45:48", "exactly what I did Oh awesome", "45:50", "oh is great is great first experience I", "45:53", "lost my nods on my first target ever I", "45:54", "went back and got him but it was a", "45:56", "fucking shit show with nods night-vision", "45:57", "goggles so things that you need to see", "46:00", "at night and we'll get in trouble for if", "46:02", "you lose it was terrible so we come in", "46:07", "number one chembio target in Iraq and we", "46:10", "had looked at it from the perspective of", "46:12", "like air conditioning specialists and", "46:13", "you know from architects to what we", "46:16", "could encounter on the ground potential", "46:17", "threat satellite imagery of historical", "46:20", "stuff and we get there and by the time I", "46:23", "even got on the ground there was already", "46:26", "a firefight going on the helicopter that", "46:28", "I was in had 27 rounds come through the", "46:30", "helicopter not a single person was hurt", "46:31", "like guys are like reaching up to like", "46:33", "scratch their ass and", "46:35", "around would come through and dismiss", "46:36", "everybody Jesus Christ", "46:38", "I take that back the door gunner", "46:40", "standing next to me got shot right in", "46:41", "the head then about a minute out that", "46:42", "was my first exposure to combat just", "46:44", "over in helicopter lands and you go and", "46:47", "by the time I got to the front door of", "46:50", "that structure I was probably as close", "46:55", "to be an unconscious due to asphyxiation", "46:57", "as I often M doing getting choked out",

"87:23", "[Laughter]", "87:27", "other times you're watching it through", "87:29", "by nose it seems like that's one of", "87:31", "those things that once you get through", "87:33", "and once you get through buds and once", "87:35", "you get through how weak and once you", "87:36", "get through all the difficult physical", "87:38", "tasks and you actually become a seal how", "87:40", "many people

in 2013 though I left", "88:03", "last day of June 2 2013 so if it has", "88:05", "changed since then I don't know anything", "88:08", "about it but you know the Navy obviously", "88:11", "it's you're a Navy SEAL so you're", "88:12", "governed by the United States Navy they", "88:14", "make you do a PRT of physical readiness", "88:16", "test which is running pull-ups push-ups", "88:18", "sit-ups

I'm saying so the bar", "88:32", "if you trip over the bar at that point", "88:34", "like you you know your hamstrings don't", "88:37", "work or you know just you suck it but", "88:40", "there are varying levels there are", "88:42", "people who are very like the individuals", "88:43", "that you're talking about and then there", "88:45", "are others that will let it slip and", "88:48", "they slip a percentage point over time", "88:50", "there's some you know obese disgustingly", "88:56", "overweight seals not many and everything", "89:00", "in between so the hard way for me to", "89:02",

other for sure", "89:20", "how much how many of them are involved", "89:22", "in martial arts again hard to say", "89:29", "because I know it has drastically", "89:31", "changed since I was in the amount of so", "89:34", "I was telling before I sat down with", "89:35", "Henner", "89:35", "Gracie yesterday we were just talking", "89:37", "about a lot about his interaction with", "89:39", "law enforcement and how they got started", "89:40", "and it was with the Rodney King rides", "89:41", "actually I didn't know that but that's", "89:43", "when they started interfacing with law", "89:44",

really", "91:00", "that's interesting I would have assumed", "91:01", "that it would have been a core part of", "91:04", "training like from the beginning just to", "91:06", "build character and to

happening is is in I", "91:35", "was talking about the hen about this", "91:36", "yesterday and I have a much better", "91:38", "understanding of it now you can elicit", "91:41", "actions from people if you don't know", "91:44", "what you're doing if you do have to go", "91:45", "hands-on and you're trying to detain", "91:46", "somebody but you're asking about how", "91:48", "much I weighed right

that you needed to well you", "92:34", "see that with police when you watch", "92:35", "videos cops trying to detain suspects", "92:38", "and then they lose control situation and", "92:40", "it's

yeah but", "93:27", "unfortunately the cops aren't either and", "93:29", "they're doing these stupid things and", "93:31", "hitting this person and trying to", "93:32", "control them and then the guy gets out", "93:34", "gets to his car pulls out a gun and", "93:36", "kills them and I've watched a video like", "93:38", "that recently so the guy who got me into", "93:41", "jujitsu was a sheriff and I actually", "93:45", "just the only reason I started this", "93:47", "because I wanted him to shut up I had", "93:49", "known him for like a year like cousin", "93:51", "and for me it's like the
