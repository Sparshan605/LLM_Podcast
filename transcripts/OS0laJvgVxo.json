"07:38", "out before we because as you say once", "07:41", "you get the engine's going fast enough", "07:42", "that you're you're headed for Mars you", "07:44", "can't just turn around there's no coming", "07:45", "back that's it well I mean the Apollo 13", "07:48", "right they lost an engine on the way to", "07:50", "the moon they coasted all the way to the", "07:52", "moon and they just used like like ball", "07:55", "on the end of a string they just went", "07:56", "around the moon with the gravity the", "07:57", "moon to sling them back at Earth again", "07:59", "so if something failed

much yeah you got to", "08:09", "have all the problems solved before you", "08:11", "head that way and what about like", "08:13", "sustainable resources like as far as", "08:14", "like food and things like that do they", "08:16", "have to when they have to terraform when", "08:19", "they get to mars well we're going for we", "08:21", "don't know we're trying to figure all", "08:23", "that out a really interesting discovery", "08:26", "about three weeks ago curiosity that big", "08:28", "Rover that that is driving around on", "08:31", "Mars right now has some pretty good", "08:33", "equipment on it and it discovered just", "08:35", "in the last few weeks that in every", "08:37", "cubic foot of dirt on Mars there's a", "08:40", "quart of water so there's oceans of", "08:45", "water I mean the topsoil is full of", "08:47", "water on Mars so that's really promising", "08:50", "for when we get there because water is", "08:53", "hydrogen and oxygen", "08:54", "oxygen to breathe hydrogen and oxygen", "08:56", "makes fuel hydrogen oxygen makes water", "08:57", "so that's a huge resource the moon there", "09:01", "there's water there but it's really rare", "09:03", "so that's a big discovery for us", "09:06", "eventually being able to go there but", "09:09", "you know we need a power source the", "09:11", "sun's a long ways away and it's dusty on", "09:13", "Mars you can't just you can't have a", "09:15", "solar powered bulldozer you know you", "09:17", "mean a power source and we need how do", "09:19", "you navigate and there's just all how do", "09:23", "you build a perfect closed-loop", "09:25", "environmental system so that you don't", "09:27", "have a constant losses and because of", "09:29", "the space station we only I think it's", "09:31", "about 92 percent of our water we reclaim", "09:33", "but we constantly need that little", "09:35", "trickle from Earth of new water because", "09:37", "it's not perfect there's there's a whole", "09:39", "there's a lot of stuff we need when", "09:40", "don't even know what we don't know yet", "09:42", "and that's I think why we'll we'll sort", "09:44", "a lot of that out on the moon before we", "09:46", "launch to Mars to me watching the", "09:48", "footage of the rover and the images that", "09:51", "it sent back was almost surreal it", "09:54", "didn't seem real it's it's it was hard", "09:56", "for me to wrap my head around the idea", "09:57", "that they sent a robot to another planet", "10:00", "it's roaming around taking pictures and", "10:02", "sending them back and we're looking at", "10:04", "yeah it's phenomenal", "10:05", "it's incredible yeah that we could do", "10:07", "that and and the way that came to you", "10:09", "know Mars has has just the wrong", "10:11", "atmosphere it's not thick enough to use", "10:14", "a parachute in but it's not thin enough", "10:16", "that you can ignore it and just and just", "10:18", "slow down and land with a rocket you", "10:20", "know it's it's it's not good for landing", "10:22", "the Earth's atmosphere is nice and thick", "10:24", "you can come down under a parachute and", "10:26", "the moon has none so you can just like", "10:28", "the Apollo guys you can just land on", "10:30", "your rocket plume Mars you're kind of", "10:32", "stuck in the middle so you need a", "10:33", "complex landing system and curiosity the", "10:36", "way they came up with a solution that", "10:38", "was just phenomenal the big arrow break", "10:40", "through the atmosphere and then that", "10:42", "sequence of miracles and the", "10:43", "retrorockets and the extendable bridle", "10:45", "and everything it is amazing that that", "10:47", "worked and a huge kudos to the JPL guys", "10:50", "and everybody who came up with it that", "10:51", "and the stuff it's teaching us about how", "10:55", "planets work and and what is what is the", "10:58", "past and the future for that planet Mars", "11:00", "and therefore gives us a lot better", "11:02", "understanding of what's normal and what", "11:04", "what look we can expect on earth yeah", "11:06", "huge kudos to those people indeed", "11:08", "they did an amazing amazing thing and", "11:10", "just one of those in my opinion when", "11:13", "those paradigm-shifting moments where", "11:15", "when you know we're back here on earth", "11:17", "and we're watching those images like wow", "11:19", "they can do this now yeah I'm an", "11:21", "astronaut I'm an astronaut and you know", "11:23", "I've been in space twice and I gathered", "11:25", "my family around to watch that thing", "11:27", "happen because it's so it is right on", "11:29", "the edge of what we can just barely do", "11:31", "and such a brave thing to do and such a", "11:34", "capable probe a capable extension of us", "11:37", "all to put down on the surface and it's", "11:39", "teaching us about Mars did you ever pay", "11:41", "any attention to the face on Mars or any", "11:43", "of that craziness that's or that's all", "11:45", "fun and you know there's there's faces", "11:47", "all over I mean just lay on your back", "11:49", "and look at the clouds", "11:50", "there's faces everywhere right that's", "11:52", "sure we we naturally look for faces", "11:54", "especially in weird shadowy images sharp", "11:56", "those images were mean there were some", "11:58", "really unique things there's a rock near", "12:00", "my house that's a square rock and when I", "12:02", "have a friend who believes in a lot of", "12:04", "conspiracy theories and not believes and", "12:05", "uh the face on Mars and a lot of", "12:07", "different stuff and I said I'm gonna", "12:08", "show you something man come over here I", "12:10", "go look at that rock do you think", "12:11", "anybody made that rock I go that rock is", "12:13", "just made that's just a rock amongst a", "12:14", "pile of rocks it's big and it's kind of", "12:16", "square not perfectly square but if you", "12:19", "looked at a blurry picture of it that", "12:20", "was taken from space you swear this is", "12:22", "the building block for a pyramid", "12:24", "obviously she's clearly made by an", "12:26", "intelligent species same one that built", "12:28", "the pyramids yeah I know it's it's", "12:30", "always easier to believe something than", "12:33", "it is to understand it yeah the", "12:35", "fascinating thing about the the face on", "12:37", "Mars is not that it looks like a face on", "12:40", "Mars it's the idea that Mars at one", "12:42", "point in time actually could have", "12:44", "sustained some form of life and in fact", "12:46", "definitely did it had an atmosphere that", "12:49", "was livable at one point in time they", "12:51", "really there could have been some kind", "12:53", "of life maybe it was just like microbes", "12:55", "or plants or might still I mean yeah is", "12:57", "the biggest volcano in the solar system", "12:59", "so it has heat and it has all this water", "13:02", "it's but that we've just found now for", "13:04", "sure and heat and water on earth always", "13:07", "means life to me and just look under", "13:09", "your sink and so on on Mars maybe", "13:12", "there's a fossil record of it maybe", "13:13", "there's even something still primitive", "13:15", "stuff living somewhere in the rock we", "13:17", "don't know but we haven't found any yet", "13:18", "but if we can find it on Mars", "13:21", "and we know this life on earth and", "13:22", "there's life everywhere and that would", "13:24", "be a pretty important thing to figure", "13:25", "out or the possibility that life", "13:27", "actually started on Mars and some sort", "13:29", "of an impact from an asteroid panspermia", "13:32", "Senate hurling towards the earth and I'm", "13:34", "not sure that's a logical conclusion you", "13:38", "know if if life can start somewhere then", "13:41", "it can start in two places all right and", "13:42", "so it doesn't have to miraculously beep", "13:44", "and sperm \u00ebadd from one planet to", "13:46", "another if it formed on Mars then and", "13:48", "there's life on Earth then it's a more", "13:50", "logical conclusion to think that it just", "13:52", "formed in two places I think do you when", "13:55", "when you sit in that Space Station and", "13:58", "you're floating above Earth much as you", "14:00", "were saying that your colleagues started", "14:01", "referring to Earth as like a separate", "14:04", "individual entity and you guys were", "14:05", "separate from Earth did you look out", "14:07", "when you're looking at the vastness of",

spaceship and", "14:32", "you look at the world you're looking at", "14:34", "it through the windows", "14:35", "and I came back it was so funny I came", "14:37", "back from my first space flight and we", "14:39", "sit in the living room with my wife", "14:40", "Elena and we were watching Star Trek and", "14:42", "they show that scene with Sulu and", "14:44", "whoever up front and there's the

right", "14:54", "in 1968 or whatever it was because when", "14:56", "you're inside the spaceship it looks", "14:58", "like that the difference is when you go", "15:01", "outside and then you are it's like the", "15:06", "difference between sitting in your", "15:07", "living room looking outside and hanging", "15:08", "on a cliff or you know hanging on half", "15:10", "dome or somewhere where it's

70", "23:57", "seconds you're through the altitude and", "23:58", "speed of the Concorde accelerating", "24:00", "straight up and after two minutes here", "24:02", "about 160,000 feet and six times the", "24:04", "speed of sound but you're above almost", "24:06", "all the air and then your first stage", "24:08", "falls off so inside it's this it's this", "24:12", "incredibly powerful push in

for the next", "24:44", "six minutes or six-and-a-half to", "24:46", "accelerate out horizontal basically to", "24:49", "five miles a second and and so for the", "24:51", "last six minutes it's like a long liquid", "24:54", "drive heavy steady pushing like someone", "24:58", "with their fist in your back pushing you", "25:00", "faster and faster and faster a smoother", "25:02", "ride because you're

off and you're in space and", "25:14", "you're weightless Wow so it's nine", "25:17", "minutes yeah it's eight and 42 on the", "25:19", "shuttle and just under nine like 855 for", "25:22", "the Soyuz what's the maximum g-force you", "25:24", "experienced during that uh the shuttle", "25:27", "is about three G and in fact when you", "25:28", "hit three G that's what the throttle", "25:30", "start coming back because it was only", "25:31", "built for about three and a half G so", "25:33", "three times your normal weights if we", "25:34", "weigh 200 pounds you weigh 600 pounds in", "25:36",

the Blue Angels", "25:46", "one of those f-18s once I was an f-18", "25:48", "pilot for a lot of years ah those", "25:50", "incredible that's a great airplane you", "25:52", "got to fly those yeah what's the most", "25:55", "Jeezy pulled in one of those things if", "25:57", "you take an f-18 and you grab the stick", "25:59", "and you snap it into your lap you aren't", "26:02", "actually connected to anything except a", "26:04", "computer it's little sensors it's", "26:06", "fly-by-wire so it says wow he wants to", "26:09", "turn right now and so then it moves all", "26:11", "the control surfaces of the airplane but", "26:14", "it doesn't want to break the wings off", "26:15", "so it will limit you it's it's the", "26:17", "airplane limits the amount of G that it", "26:19", "can pull and it'll give you about 8g", "26:22", "about 8g that's all it'll give you", "26:24", "because otherwise you could structurally", "26:27", "damage the airplane so there", "26:29", "was a paddle you could actually if you", "26:31", "were going to hit the ground you could", "26:32", "hit this paddle that would override the", "26:34", "G control system and snap it in your lap", "26:35", "and just give you whatever the", "26:36", "aerodynamics would give you and we've", "26:38", "had people pull 12 G but but the Soyuz", "26:43", "if you come into the atmosphere the", "26:45", "wrong way can pull 20 or 22 G on the way", "26:47", "home which is just just wicked and that", "26:50", "happened once in the Russian and you", "26:52", "survive that you're lying down when", "26:55", "you're in an f-18 like when you flew", "26:56", "with the Blue Angels you're sitting", "26:58", "upright so when you pull back it pushes", "27:01", "the G the the blood down to your feet", "27:03", "so the real limitation is how much of", "27:06", "that can you stand before you can't you", "27:08", "can't stay awake for your blackout in a", "27:11", "Soyuz we're actually laying on our back", "27:13", "so the blood doesn't drain out of your", "27:15", "head it just gets kind of pushed to the", "27:16", "back of your body so therefore you can", "27:18", "survive it", "27:19", "it won't black you out it doesn't damage", "27:21", "you it's it's sort of like a prolonged", "27:25", "car crash", "27:25", "you know people pull 20g in a car crash", "27:27", "but it's instantaneous if you fall into", "27:30", "the atmosphere of the wrong way in a", "27:31", "Soyuz then as you hit the thick", "27:34", "atmosphere it's almost like crashing", "27:36", "into something super high G peak for", "27:38", "maybe 30 seconds and then then you come", "27:40", "through that GP can slow down and it's", "27:42", "survivable but I would want to write it", "27:45", "Wow that feeling must be just incredible", "27:48", "what what are the thoughts that are", "27:50", "going through your mind when you when", "27:52", "you're going that fast shooting up into", "27:53", "space I was funny and I'm focusing on", "27:58", "the job because there's a million things", "28:00", "that can fail and and one of the mantras", "28:04", "of astronauts is there is no problem so", "28:05", "bad that you can't make it worse so so", "28:08", "we think of a dad all the time and so we", "28:10", "we really are careful in the way up and", "28:13", "so a big part of you is involved with", "28:15", "that but another part of you is just", "28:17", "it's just loving the ride so much and I", "28:21", "found after a while that my cheeks were", "28:23", "hurting and I was like why is my face", "28:25", "hurt and I realized cuz this smile this", "28:27", "big stupid smile was of my face so much", "28:28", "so my cheeks were cramping up cuz", "28:30", "because it was so much of a thrill", "28:33", "that's a go means and yeah it was like", "28:35", "heaven you know one want those two", "28:37", "people on your shoulders one that's", "28:38", "being all serious and one that's yelling", "28:39", "bad advice to you the one that's having", "28:41", "a good time is", "28:42", "good we old I just love on the ride it", "28:45", "is so much fun well I guess that's a", "28:47", "good time to do that right because", "28:48", "you're completely helpless", "28:49", "actually enjoy it you're not helpless at", "28:52", "all yeah you're you're there's all sorts", "28:54", "of stuff that you're responsible for on", "28:56", "the way up on the way down even in the", "28:57", "Suez window right down on this we get", "29:00", "the full control panel and there's stuff", "29:02", "you have to do oh you have to do as it's", "29:04", "happening oh yeah what do you do why", "29:05", "like while you're flying up well if", "29:08", "everything works markedly we're just", "29:09", "watching and in same in the shuttle we", "29:11", "have very you know hopefully don't have", "29:13", "to do anything but sometimes things", "29:15", "don't go right and then you got a bunch", "29:16", "of things you can do you know various", "29:18", "shutdowns and aborts and people probably", "29:20", "don't know but the shuttle as it", "29:23", "launched up the east coast to the US", "29:25", "we kept abort landing runways all the", "29:27", "way up to coast you could land at Cherry", "29:29", "Point you can land in New York you could", "29:30", "land in newfoundland or all those places", "29:32", "and so as you're ticking up the coast", "29:34", "you're constantly going okay if we have", "29:36", "a failure now we're going to abort this", "29:38", "way we're going to turn Oregon and land", "29:39", "of Bermuda we're going to land here", "29:40", "we're going to land and and you know", "29:42", "practice those like crazy and then you", "29:44", "get to a certain point and then you", "29:45", "would land in North Africa or South", "29:47", "France or in Spain and all those windows", "29:50", "all those tick points all those", "29:52", "thresholds you have to get your word", "29:54", "that's what we're hyper aware of or not", "29:56", "we're not along for the ride Wow so", "29:58", "while this is all going on you have this", "30:00", "big giant smile and you still are", "30:02", "calculating oh yeah still going okay if", "30:04", "it screws up now I go here oh yeah run", "30:07", "my thumb down a long list of all the", "30:09", "various wickets that you're jumping", "30:11", "through yeah you pay attention how much", "30:13", "of the the trip is automated how much of", "30:16", "it is manual we'd like it to be as", "30:20", "automated as possible because if it's if", "30:23", "that means things are predictable and", "30:24", "things didn't break and for the vast", "30:26", "majority of shuttle flights and Soyuz", "30:29", "flights its automated but sometimes it's", "30:32", "not on the way uphill and we've had", "30:35", "engines fail or engines start to fail", "30:37", "had to shut engines down and go to", "30:38", "backup or at least a reserve", "30:41", "configuration of the engines", "30:43", "you get mid launch yeah during watch", "30:47", "that happen on a couple shot to happen", "30:48", "on Apollo as well on the way back to", "30:51", "earth", "30:52", "we've had

on the way home and you", "31:02", "just start spinning the vehicle and then", "31:03", "it just comes in like like a peer", "31:05", "meteorite you pull about eight or nine G", "31:07", "on a ballistic entry and that's that's", "31:10", "that's pretty tough after six months of", "31:12", "weightlessness too suddenly if you're a", "31:14", "200 pounder now you weigh 1600 or 1700", "31:17", "pounds and that's that's that's pretty", "31:19", "hard on the body Wow it's incredible the", "31:22", "feeling that you must have had when you", "31:24", "actually stepped onto ground again what", "31:28", "was that like it's awful it's an awful", "31:31", "here you're so nauseous and dizzy and", "31:34", "and the reason is of course your vision", "31:40", "is telling you one thing telling you", "31:42", "where the horizon is where up is but", "31:45", "your inner ear which normally when your", "31:47", "eyes are closed keeps you from falling", "31:48", "over you know you can close your eyes", "31:49", "and not fall over that has forgotten", "31:52", "completely what to do with gravity", "31:53", "because you've been weightless for", "31:55", "whatever five or six months so now you", "31:58", "have this sudden great violent", "32:00", "disagreement between what your eyes are", "32:02", "saying and what your inner ear is saying", "32:04", "it's like if you spin 50 times and then", "32:05", "stop spinning and you stagger around so", "32:08", "your body says well there is something", "32:11", "seriously wrong", "32:12", "why is his vision so wildly different", "32:15", "than his inner ear and for the last", "32:17", "million years one of the probable causes", "32:20", "was you ate something poisonous you ate", "32:23", "some sort of neurotoxin or something", "32:25", "that is messing up your internal systems", "32:27", "and it might kill you so the first thing", "32:30", "your body makes you want to do is throw", "32:31", "up because it's trying to get rid of", "32:33",

going", "32:57", "on it's is there happiness along with", "33:00", "that I mean is there a feeling of being", "33:02", "home oh yeah yeah all three of my", "33:04", "flights", "33:05", "and if the flight went well and we work", "33:07", "hard enough that they almost always do", "33:09", "there's a great sense of satisfaction", "33:11", "because we just it's like the final step", "33:15", "in an

"33:34", "by space and if you look up you see the", "33:36", "lights here are covered with ice on it I", "33:38", "like I like your life stars are good but", "33:41", "what what drives me nuts", "33:43", "is how little we actually get to see of", "33:46", "the stars because of light pollution I", "33:49", "was uh at the Big Island and I went to", "33:51", "the Keck Observatory yeah and there's", "33:53", "the there's a station like there's the", "33:56", "words that the telescope is and then", "33:58", "below that at like nine thousand feet", "34:00", "there's like this visitor station have", "34:01", "you been I've been near there up and up", "34:03", "at the top of a couple of the mountains", "34:05", "there to have a look at the sky it's", "34:06", "incredible yes we I was I was when we", "34:10", "were driving up there I was worried that", "34:11", "it was too cloudy I was like oh this is", "34:13", "gonna be terrible", "34:14", "you know I we wanted to go and see the", "34:15", "stars and we picked a cloudy night but", "34:17", "we drove through the clouds and then", "34:20", "when you get above there and you realize", "34:22", "that the entire Big Island they have", "34:24", "special diffused lighting to make sure", "34:25", "that they don't emit light pollution the", "34:28", "view is life-changing it must be like", "34:31", "one one-millionth of what you experience", "34:33", "on the space station but for me it was a", "34:37", "real life-changing moment I'll never", "34:39", "forget it and I think about it all the", "34:41", "time whenever I look at the stars I", "34:43", "always think about that night in Hawaii", "34:44", "that's what it looks like but but even", "34:46", "crazier there's uh there's an image of", "34:49", "it up there yeah but even crazier when", "34:51", "you're actually experiencing you can see", "34:53", "the Milky Way and I remember thinking", "34:56", "God we have to figure out a way to stop", "34:58", "light pollution because I think just", "35:00", "that just being able to look up and see", "35:02", "that would change people's perceptions", "35:05", "and would probably make people way more", "35:08", "enthusiastic

atmosphere above you and you", "35:33", "can see the texture of space you can see", "35:35", "the I mean the Milky Way you can see why", "35:38", "it's called the Milky Way I mean it's", "35:39", "it's a white grey white part of the sky", "35:43", "you know and you don't need a telescope", "35:44", "to see it you can see it with your eyes", "35:46", "I don't need some special time-lapse",

on", "36:02", "light pollution people are indoor", "36:04", "creatures and cities and they have", "36:05", "street lights and they drive around in", "36:06", "cars and I don't know how you get people", "36:11", "to notice the universe around them I", "36:13", "think would help if they could just see", "36:15", "it you know it start if you look up in", "36:18", "Los Angeles go what do you say yeah I", "36:20", "got a star I lived in Houston yeah for a", "36:23", "long time and yeah I look at that I", "36:24", "could see a teen stars tonight it's a", "36:25", "real midnight Carolee but when you're up", "36:28", "there and then the observatory and I'm", "36:30", "sure when you were at 40,000 feet in the", "36:32", "jet it must have been amazing yeah yeah", "36:34", "it's it it's not that much further away", "36:37", "I mean the Big Island Mountain is not", "36:40", "all that high no but you just need one", "36:42", "sometimes one small step and you can see", "36:44", "a whole new thing yeah I had uh some", "36:47", "similar but not quite as intense", "36:49", "viewings in the mountains above Boulder", "36:51", "Colorado so I could 8500 feet up there", "36:54", "was beautiful too but I think that we we", "36:57", "forget that we're really in space as", "36:59", "stupid as that sounds people really do", "37:01", "forget so I was going around the world", "37:03", "and my son who ran the social media for", "37:06", "the flight to a large degree sent me a", "37:08", "note saying hey Dad Mount Etna is", "37:09", "erupting you know in southern Italy have", "37:11", "a look at Mount Etna so I'm a good dad", "37:13", "took a picture of Mount Etna but seeing", "37:17", "the the superheated lava and the smoke", "37:20", "and the steam coming out of the earth", "37:23", "was a really especially when you're", "37:25", "looking at the world as a ball was a", "37:27", "really clear reminder of the fact that", "37:29", "most of the planet is super", "37:32", "heated lava and magma and we're so hot", "37:34", "that the rock is liquid and plastic", "37:36", "right and and we just live on this", "37:39", "little chilled crust like like the top", "37:42", "of a porridge pot you know and we just", "37:44", "live on this little thin bit at the top", "37:46", "that is crust and when you tip it the", "37:48", "other way around and look up half of the", "37:51", "atmosphere is in the first three miles", "37:53", "three miles you know think about you", "37:55", "people go for a three-mile run you know", "37:57", "it that and half really the whole", "37:59", "habitable atmosphere is three miles", "38:01", "above 15,000 feet it's hard to even live", "38:03", "and yeah we live in beats on this little", "38:06", "bit of cooled crust and this little", "38:07", "sliver of air and we think it's", "38:10", "guaranteed we think it's we think we're", "38:12", "invincible right and we think the whole", "38:14", "universe is here to serve us and we're", "38:16", "like we're like bacteria in a corner you", "38:20", "know just just found a little niche that", "38:22", "will support our life so much so that", "38:24", "we're willing to almost are in entire", "38:26", "system as far as energy is based on", "38:29", "burning things uh yeah that's exact face", "38:32", "of releasing if you talk about a hundred", "38:34", "years from now looking back and going", "38:35", "what were we thinking I mean golly I", "38:37", "mean you can see why a five-gallon pail", "38:40", "of gasoline is an amazingly enabling", "38:42", "thing you can stick it in your car and", "38:44", "drive hundreds of miles you know and you", "38:46", "can carry it in your hand and it's", "38:48", "fairly stable it's a very seductive fuel", "38:51", "but at the same time it has such", "38:54", "consequences and when we look when we", "38:56", "figure out the next energy source when", "38:59", "we look back hopefully in a couple", "39:01", "hundred years we will go what were we", "39:03", "thinking hopefully yeah we seem that", "39:06", "it's really hard for people to change to", "39:08", "once once we have a pattern that we", "39:10", "follow yeah it's very difficult", "39:12", "especially if we found a way to make it", "39:14", "work for ourselves yeah yeah in spite of", "39:17", "all the pollution we still rock it that", "39:20", "way in spite of all the stuff that we", "39:22", "throw into the ocean we just you know", "39:23", "still kind of happening basically on a", "39:25", "daily basis well you can't yeah once you", "39:28", "built a structure it's real hard to", "39:30", "change of course and you can't just", "39:31", "suddenly starve means of people or", "39:33", "killed millions of people just because", "39:34", "you decide to change energy

you it's a", "39:54", "brute force way I mean it and we're", "39:56", "burning dinosaurs to get to space but", "39:58", "it's it's so far it's the only way we", "40:00", "figured out how so far it's the only way", "40:01", "now when you you think about like what's", "40:04", "possible for the future when they start", "40:06", "talking about all these different", "40:07", "propulsion methods that will someday be", "40:09", "available what what if any of them", "40:11", "appear viable yeah you're asking me to", "40:15", "predict physics inventions of the future", "40:19", "which gosh I I wish I could do that I'd", "40:21", "go I'd do it tomorrow I don't know to me", "40:26", "the obvious answer is every single", "40:29", "molecule that exists every complex", "40:32", "molecule and atom was

if you if you could truly get", "40:54", "the energy that's inside all of the", "40:56", "molecules that are in there there's it", "40:57", "there's so much energy stored there you", "41:00", "know we have like wood that's stored", "41:02", "sunlight right and we by burning it we", "41:04", "can release that stored solar power even", "41:06", "nuclear but we haven't found a clean way", "41:09", "to to release the energy to gives us", "41:13", "nuclear power we can do it but we're", "41:15", "still you know we're kind of cavemen", "41:17", "about it and we haven't got it a clean", "41:19", "way so I'm certain that at some point we", "41:22", "will figure out how to whether it'll be", "41:24", "cold fusion or just fusion itself but if", "41:27", "you read what they're doing in the", "41:29", "various laboratories around the world", "41:30", "even the experts think well we're", "41:32", "probably 50 years away from from being", "41:35", "able to contain fusion so that it", "41:36", "becomes a net positive power source and", "41:39", "but you know when the experts are saying", "41:41", "it's 50 years until we can do it who", "41:43", "knows there was a recent article in one", "41:48", "of the science magazines that the volume", "41:49", "of nuclear waste could be reduced by 90%", "41:52", "that they've shown that they can mix", "41:55", "plutonium contaminated way",

stable", "42:09", "end product huh I've always felt like I", "42:12", "mean the nuclear waste thing is a huge", "42:15", "issue obviously I mean they've done a", "42:17", "lot of weird things like dig holes in", "42:19", "the ground and buried in their Nevada", "42:20", "and you know and what's going on now and", "42:23", "Fukushima is very disturbing they're", "42:24", "trying to figure out how to

"42:32", "those crazy monkeys I figure out a way", "42:34", "to fix things yeah and it's just our", "42:37", "nature necessity is the main mother and", "42:39", "we need sometimes we don't think we have", "42:41", "the necessity and yeah nuclear waste is", "42:44", "a big problem of you know fossil fuel", "42:45", "waste is a huge problem as well and", "42:47", "neither of them are perfect even solar", "42:49", "energy has waste you know because of you", "42:51", "have to build all the solar panels and", "42:53", "you have to collect all the rare earth", "42:54", "metals none of it's for free we have to", "42:57", "find as best to trade-off as we can and", "42:59", "and still be able to try and sustain as", "43:02", "good a standard of living for as many", "43:04", "people around the planet as possible and", "43:06", "in we've done we I mean we feed more", "43:09", "people now than we ever have right but", "43:11", "but how how do we do it in the future", "43:14", "how do we get better at it I'm not sure", "43:16", "there's so many variables obviously and", "43:18", "but I'm always very excited when I see", "43:21", "something like this that is like my", "43:24", "faith in the crazy cuman's has been", "43:26", "restored like these these nuts have", "43:29", "figured out a way to fix an issue or at", "43:31", "least reduce an issue significantly as", "43:33", "much as 90 plus percent yeah the the the", "43:37", "fossil fuel thing to me is is a weird", "43:40", "one because obviously little I enjoy it", "43:43", "we use it it's so important for almost", "43:44", "everything we do but obviously this is", "43:46", "going to create a problem someday and", "43:48", "there's no better example for that for", "43:51", "me then you know the automobile", "43:53", "pollution or pollution that you get from", "43:55", "jet airplanes on a daily basis how much", "43:58", "it mean the there's a big impact in the", "44:01", "environment every time the Space Shuttle",

times I mean you couldn't even", "44:12", "measure compared to everything else the", "44:14", "pollution that it injected if it had", "44:15", "gotten to the point where it was like", "44:17", "air travel yeah we wouldn't want you", "44:19", "know thousands of those launching every", "44:21", "day you know but that wasn't it wasn't a", "44:24", "possibility and wasn't what it was gonna", "44:25", "do but compared to just you know how we", "44:28", "burn coal to generate electricity and", "44:30", "how we use cars to transport ourselves", "44:31", "around the you know there are 40 what 42", "44:37", "thousand people are killed just in car", "44:39", "crashes mmm you know that is a it's a", "44:42", "societal norm in the United States we", "44:44", "expect that we say that's okay it's all", "44:46", "right to kill 42,000 people so we have", "44:48", "the freedom to drive our cars around", "44:49", "wherever we want kind of an interesting", "44:51", "level of accepted disaster

fumes on a daily basis it will", "45:35", "reduce your life period yeah but but", "45:40", "yeah I agree with you but none of us are", "45:42", "lasting forever and people live where", "45:44", "they want to live for all the reasons", "45:45", "and only one of the variables is how", "45:47", "many years are going to live there right", "45:48", "would you rather live in the middle of", "45:50",

uh-huh that that little alien", "46:15", "guy Sam yeah when you're up there when", "46:18", "you're in space I mean do you ponder the", "46:22", "possibility and is that something", "46:24", "you ever wondered yourself are there", "46:26", "intelligent life forms out there and if", "46:29", "so do you think that they watch us do", "46:30", "you think they're aware of us you", "46:34", "mentioned earlier that with Galileo", "46:35", "inventing the telescope he was you know", "46:38", "tortured for pointing out that we", "46:41", "weren't the center of the universe and", "46:45", "with every invention that's come since", "46:47", "then we've been able to prove more and", "46:48", "more conclusively just how far from the", "46:50", "center of the universe we are and also", "46:52", "how

the you know this", "48:15", "strange big head that what it may very", "48:17", "well come from is that the actual birth", "48:19", "experience for children the first time", "48:21", "the eyes are

baby doesn't remember just because", "49:13", "they don't have a point of reference or", "49:15", "context it's very possible they remember", "49:17", "it well this scientific answer to the", "49:20",
