I watched the", "47:44", "second time knowing the result then you", "47:47", "really appreciate what Floyd's doing", "47:48", "because although Connor did catch him he", "47:50", "definitely caught him with a hard", "47:51", "uppercut in the first round that's not", "47:53", "that was interesting because that was", "47:55", "like oh shit like you got to realize", "47:57", "mind your P's and Q's this guy's legit", "47:59", "but Connor never even though he clipped", "48:01", "him with that shot never really heard", "48:03", "him it's not a one shot to the body", "48:04", "which I was surprised I gotta be honest", "48:06", "in my prediction I thought Connor was", "48:08", "gonna do well like you did in the first", "48:10", "rounds I called that I thought he's", "48:11", "gonna ruin four to five rounds and then", "48:13", "I thought you'd wanna pack up would", "48:15", "wobble him and that would be enough to", "48:17", "win Connor kind of spectacle but just it", "48:20", "got you know

don't think Connor is", "48:28", "really like digging in on these shots", "48:31", "because I think he was probably", "48:32", "concerned about his endurance you got to", "48:34", "realize also this fight was relatively", "48:36", "short notice so short notice that I had", "48:39", "already booked the DC improv in advance", "48:41", "and it was sold out by the time they", "48:43", "announced the fight correct so are not", "48:45", "the DC improv that the Warner Theatre in", "48:47", "DC so if you think about that that's", "48:49", "fucking months in advance three months", "48:52", "they did this fight was announced three", "48:53", "months ago that's enough that's nothing", "48:55", "for this not to do the fight most the", "48:58", "time a fight like this is six seven", "49:00", "months out oh my god maybe more when did", "49:03", "they announce Canelo tripled in a long", "49:04", "term ow I think between the time they", "49:06", "announced it and when the fight starts I", "49:08", "got a feel like it's five months at", "49:10", "least at least why which is norm I would", "49:11", "assume but but at least they but they", "49:13", "also boxing was smart because they set", "49:15", "it up right so the at Canelo ish Chavez", "49:18", "Jr that's a joke but that was literally", "49:20", "just a setup to get him to trip to", "49:23", "triple G and they both knew it he's", "49:24", "relooking at basically a year in the", "49:26", "making and before that what two years in", "49:28", "the making and here's more importantly", "49:30", "during that entire time they're both", "49:32", "boxing so Connors not mean he's not", "49:35", "really sure if he's gonna actually have", "49:37", "this boxing match with Floyd Mayweather", "49:38", "right so he knocks out Eddie Alvarez and", "49:40", "then somehow another the rumblings get", "49:43", "started but that's just not enough time", "49:46", "well did you do you who wants to prepare", "49:48", "for Floyd I agree especially in that", "49:50", "arena the best of all time in that", "49:52", "Floyd goes listen I tried making this", "49:55", "fight before this and the UC turned it", "49:57", "down and he goes alright we'll see what", "49:59", "happens and then he goes then I came", "50:01", "back and was like yo this how much money", "50:03", "we could make he was and then they were", "50:04", "like alright let's do it", "50:05", "he was but I tried making this fight a", "50:06", "while ago but even before this yeah I", "50:08", "remember the discussions but to be to be", "50:11", "that close like when they actually", "50:13", "announced it okay this is actually", "50:14", "happening crazy it's crazy to have it so", "50:17", "quickly switch to this magnitude of a", "50:19", "fight yeah it's nuts so if something", "50:21", "like that if you gave Conor like six", "50:24", "months maybe he could get in better", "50:26", "shape or he could survive he's always", "50:28", "going to fit
