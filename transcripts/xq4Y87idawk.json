problem with asking people to not", "05:17", "show up simply based on their color of", "05:19", "their skin exactly and what was the", "05:22", "argument against that like when when you", "05:24",

by", "06:56", "this and people of color are united it's", "06:58", "not at all like that but the part of the", "07:01", "the hidden story here is that in order", "07:04", "to invent advance certain

first of all study", "07:37", "the question of why racism occurs and I", "07:40", "I believe been pretty courageous in", "07:43", "fighting against it where I've run into", "07:45", "it so to challenge me with that", "07:46", "particular epithet was a mistake on", "07:50", "their part it was a strategic mistake", "07:52", "and I kept trying to tell them while", "07:54", "this was still internally being", "07:56", "discussed in the college I kept trying", "07:57", "to tell them that they should really", "07:59", "check the concept that I'm a racist they", "08:02", "should ask because if they did they", "08:04", "would discover that they were actually", "08:06", "way off the mark and then they would", "08:07", "have an interesting puzzle on their", "08:09", "hands then they would have to explain to", "08:10", "themselves why they had found themselves", "08:12", "hurling this most poisonous term at", "08:16", "somebody who not only isn't a racist but", "08:19", "is pretty nearly the opposite well it's", "08:22", "it's a standard maneuver when someone", "08:24", "wants to silence someone when someone", "08:26", "wants to put someone in a category", "08:28", "that's instantly recognizable one of the", "08:30", "best ones is racist oh absolutely and", "08:32", "and what I found is", "08:34", "that people simply could not figure out", "08:39", "what they would do if that term was", "08:43", "applied to them right they were able to", "08:44", "preview in their minds what that would", "08:46", "be like and so many people could see", "08:49", "that there was no escape for them right", "08:51", "so it's like being called a rapist", "08:53", "almost it's like even if you are", "08:55", "exonerated there's still that cloud", "08:57", "hanging hanging above you yes but this", "09:00", "also actually points to something pretty", "09:01", "important and for anybody who travels", "09:04", "this ground themself they're going to", "09:06", "discover this that many of the terms", "09:08", "that are being used have been redefined", "09:10", "but they haven't been fully redefined so", "09:13", "one of the things that I've seen in", "09:14", "several places is that a term like", "09:17", "racist has been redefined so that the", "09:20", "bar for being a racist is so low that", "09:23", "you couldn't possibly help but trip over", "09:25", "it but then once you've tripped over it", "09:28", "and you have accepted that you are a", "09:30", "racist", "09:31", "then the stigma goes back to the", "09:33", "original definition so it is the dodging", "09:35", "and weaving between the two definitions", "09:37", "that actually does the heavy lifting", "09:39", "well there's also a really disturbing", "09:41", "idea that's being bounced around lately", "09:42", "that it's impossible to be racist if", "09:44", "you're anything other than white right", "09:46", "it is ridiculous it's preposterous", "09:49", "anybody who looks up the actual", "09:51", "definition of racism will discover that", "09:52", "that's preposterous but yes that does", "09:56", "pass in certain places as logical yeah", "10:00", "and just it's parodied in this very", "10:03", "bizarre way that's supposed to be", "10:04", "unchallenged and this is a fairly recent", "10:06", "thing I mean this is not something that", "10:08", "existed two decades ago right I agree", "10:10", "and the pace at which it's moving in the", "10:13", "last few years is very surprising it is", "10:17", "surprising but it kind of makes sense", "10:18", "because you get into these groups of", "10:21", "people they have this confirmation bias", "10:22", "they lump up together and they all", "10:24", "reinforce their ideas in this echo", "10:25", "chamber and they all do it inside the", "10:28", "colleges and then when it gets out to", "10:30", "the rest of the world as we're seeing", "10:32", "with your case at Evergreen the the rest", "10:34", "of the worlds like what is going on over", "10:36", "here like what is happening in school", "10:38", "and people who are sending their", "10:39", "children off to school are very", "10:41", "concerned with the indoctrination of",

going", "11:12", "on at Evergreen and the difference is a", "11:17", "million miles inside of Evergreen", "11:19", "actually we are descending further into", "11:22", "madness the the faculty are blaming the", "11:27", "fact that the campus had to be suddenly", "11:30", "closed due to a threat from the outside", "11:32", "yesterday on me for having talked about", "11:36", "this in the outside

don't you know we haven't", "11:49", "even talked about where this where I got", "11:51", "thrust into the spotlight here which", "11:53", "your listeners are going to have to know", "11:55", "in order to understand why I'm even", "11:56", "sitting here but but the the intensity", "12:01", "and the out of touch nature of the", "12:06", "discussion inside the college simply", "12:09", "reinforces the the impression that", "12:13", "something is desperately off that that", "12:15", "what we really have is a filter bubble", "12:17", "that is so so strong that even when the", "12:22", "world sends very clear evidence that", "12:24", "you've missed something somewhere and", "12:25", "it's time to rethink what you've been", "12:27", "doing they're not waking up and I love", "12:31", "this college this college we maybe will", "12:33", "get to talk about it but the structuring", "12:36", "of this college is so unusual and what", "12:38", "one can do as a professor at Evergreen", "12:40", "if you're really dedicated to teaching", "12:42", "it is the place to be because you have", "12:45", "unparalleled pedagogical freedom more", "12:48", "freedom than you'd have as a tenured", "12:49", "professor at Harvard and you also have", "12:51", "room to teach individually to students", "12:54", "because our students take one program at", "12:56", "a time they're full-time in one program", "12:58", "and the professor's teach one program at", "13:00", "a time full-time and they can go", "13:01", "on for a full year so imagine you've got", "13:04", "25 students and you have them for a year", "13:07", "full-time you really know every student", "13:10", "in your class individually not just by", "13:12", "name but you know how they think you", "13:14", "know their backgrounds you know their", "13:17", "blind spots and that allows for a kind", "13:19", "of teaching that can't be done anywhere", "13:20", "else so I am quite distressed at the", "13:24", "fact that Evergreen is now endangered by", "13:26", "what's going on and I really would like", "13:29", "to see it wake up and rescue itself", "13:32", "because it is worth rescuing I watched", "13:35", "the is that the president of the school", "13:37", "who gave the speech addressing all these", "13:40", "issues", "13:40", "George bridges yes it looked like a", "13:42", "hostage negotiation it looked like he", "13:45", "had a gun to his head he was literally a", "13:48", "hostage it was so bizarre and kids are", "13:51", "yelling things at him like what the fuck", "13:54", "are you gonna do and and and he just has", "13:57", "to take it it's so strange it's such a", "14:00", "bizarro world to view it from the", "14:03", "outside and to view these preposterous", "14:06", "allegations that these kids are

pause you", "14:48", "right pause be right there in the middle", "14:49", "no I think he's I mean I don't want a", "14:53", "caricature this because I really think", "14:55", "it's very important as preposterous is", "14:57", "what's going on is I think it's very", "14:59", "important that we understand it it's", "15:02", "very easy to dismiss it because it's so", "15:04", "strange but it's very important that we", "15:06", "get it right", "15:07", "I think the complaint about the hand", "15:09", "gestures was that they represented", "15:12", "microaggressions if you will I don't", "15:15", "know for sure", "15:15", "that that was the complaint but I can't", "15:16", "make heads or tails of it otherwise what", "15:18", "was he doing I give you can you move", "15:21", "your hands and I think he was kind of", "15:23", "gesturing like a person just trying to", "15:26", "talk with emotion right so I do think", "15:29", "there's a there's a translation which is", "15:31", "this can be portrayed as a", "15:34", "microaggression in some way you're", "15:35", "speaking it isn't well we should talk", "15:38", "about whether microaggression is even a", "15:40", "good category but um let's just say the", "15:43", "protesters had enough control over him", "15:45", "that he gestured they didn't like it", "15:48", "they told him not to", "15:49", "he capitulate he's been on the entire", "15:51", "time so I would say there's a huge", "15:54", "amount of what's going on at Evergreen", "15:56", "that is what I would call a show of", "15:59", "force is he afraid of losing his job is", "16:02", "he afraid of losing the support of the", "16:03", "students what is he afraid of well if", "16:06", "you had a guess I think he is afraid", "16:10", "he's old enough he doesn't need another", "16:13", "job he didn't need to take the job at", "16:15", "Evergreen which he took two years ago I", "16:17", "think he is afraid that this is going to", "16:20", "be the capstone of his career a scandal", "16:24", "in which he has allowed the campus to", "16:26", "get out of control which he did but", "16:28", "here's the crazy thing it's a non", "16:29", "scandal you're a non racist who's been", "16:32", "accused of being a racist all you did", "16:33", "was say hey I don't think you should be", "16:35", "able to tell people they can't show up", "16:36", "for work if they're white they can't", "16:38", "show up for school of they're white that", "16:39", "seems kind of crazy and now hand", "16:41", "gestures this is how far we've sunk that", "16:45", "the we're not a Kent State it's not the", "16:47", "National Guard shooting students it's", "16:49", "this moving your hands around while", "16:51", "you're talking with emotion that's a", "16:53", "microaggression", "16:54", "this guy's afraid of losing his job", "16:56", "because of his hand motions well it goes", "16:59", "beyond that", "17:00", "so when George came to the college he he", "17:05", "studied us which I can't hold him", "17:07", "responsible for that that was a good", "17:08", "move if he was well-intentioned he would", "17:10", "have done that but he studied us very", "17:11", "carefully he had a friend interview", "17:13", "hundreds of us to figure out what was", "17:15", "going on at the college but then he set", "17:17", "in motion policy proposals and", "17:21", "committees that were empowered in a way", "17:24", "that was completely at odds with the way", "17:26", "the school has run traditionally house", "17:28", "well so among the many unique features", "17:31", "of evergreen is the fact that the car", "17:34", "the college is in large measure governed", "17:36", "by the faculty and even the", "17:38", "administration all of the deans are", "17:40", "faculty members who have come from the", "17:41", "faculty and when they're done being", "17:42", "Dean's they go back to the faculty so", "17:44", "the faculty has control over the college", "17:47", "in a way that I don't think there's", "17:49", "another college in the country that runs", "17:51", "that way so what that means is that if", "17:55", "you want to advance a policy proposal", "17:57", "the faculty has to agree to it and", "17:59", "George wanted to do some things that the", "18:01", "faculty would not have agreed to so I'm", "18:02", "I've told you about these full-time", "18:04", "programs

"apart why I can't imagine I I can't", "18:18", "imagine why you would I mean I I can the", "18:21", "most generous thing to say is that he", "18:23", "did not understand what an important", "18:27", "part of the Evergreen model those", "18:30", "programs are whatever his reason it was", "18:33", "a terrible error and the only way to do", "18:36", "it is to advance the the idea as an", "18:40",

do", "29:57", "that well there's also the problem the", "29:59", "very real problem with the mob mentality", "30:01", "and it is a common thing with human", "30:05", "beings and they get together in

want us discussing equity as", "45:33", "teams as different teams broken up by", "45:35", "color and so the very fact that I said", "45:38", "phenotype and that I suggested that I", "45:41", "would be

lecture they assumed that if I said", "45:53", "evolution and racism that I was going to", "45:55", "give a eugenics lecture or something", "45:56", "like that and so it's preposterous the", "45:59", "the way the way this works is they've", "46:02", "shut down the conversation before you", "46:03", "can have it so that they don't actually", "46:05", "know what you're going to say and", "46:06",

not", "46:17", "happening really in high schools very", "46:18", "much it sort of bubbles up in high", "46:20", "schools it appears by", "46:22", "people that I talked to the been in high", "46:23",

"you're in some new place you they", "46:33", "everyone gathers in groups they dig", "46:36", "their heels in the sand and they go", "46:37", "fucking crazy well I mean there is", "46:40", "something about college yeah and you", "46:42", "know and we all did show them stuff in", "46:44", "college but I also think there's a", "46:47", "hidden reason for it being colleges", "46:50", "which is that there is real inequity in", "46:53", "civilization that needs to be dealt with", "46:54", "I would say the thing that I find most", "46:57", "troubling is the skew in policing and in", "47:01", "the courts that results in", "47:03", "disproportionate fractions of some", "47:05", "populations being incarcerated which has", "47:07", "terrifically destabilizing impact on", "47:10", "this community so I think that that is a", "47:11", "very real harm that would be hard to", "47:16", "overstate and that absolutely has to be", "47:19", "addressed just just to even make any", "47:21", "claim on being a fair society that said", "47:24", "it is very hard to attack the the", "47:28", "private prison complex for example right", "47:31", "it's a it's a difficult challenge on the", "47:34", "other hand the universities are a soft", "47:36", "target they can't defend themselves and", "47:38", "they already have sympathies in the", "47:40", "direction of you know a few of a", "47:44", "radically different enhanced world so in", "47:47", "effect I think we're being challenged on", "47:50", "the basis that the inequities on our", "47:52", "campuses are completely intolerable and", "47:56", "that that is largely a fiction and that", "48:01", "what really is happening is that this is", "48:03", "displaced anger over a system that is", "48:06", "fair that's been pointed at something", "48:08", "that can't defend itself", "48:10", "that's fascinating so this is a reaction", "48:12", "to the actual real inequities of the", "48:14", "outside world the systemic racism places", "48:17", "like Baltimore and what we're finding", "48:18", "out about places where they literally", "48:20", "would not sell homes to black people", "48:22", "communities that have just had", "48:24",

"right exactly so what the universities", "48:35", "what what's happening in the", "48:37", "universities is a sort of a misguided", "48:39", "reaction to all the real inequity in the", "48:41", "world", "48:41", "it said not missguided it's misdirect", "48:43", "misdirect you just pointed it the wrong", "48:45", "thing and the reason it's pointed at the", "48:47", "colleges and universities is that they", "48:49", "simply can't defend themselves hmm", "48:52", "that's fascinating", "48:53", "and so this is occurring in universities", "48:58", "all over the country and at a rate", "49:01", "that's according to people that I know", "49:03", "that teach pretty unprecedented that", "49:06", "this wasn't the case twenty years ago", "49:08", "that you would have dissent you would", "49:09", "have debate you'd have discussion but", "49:12", "you wouldn't have these full-blown", "49:14", "ideological mobs yeah I think the thing", "49:17", "is it hadn't been operationalized yet", "49:19", "the thought process that led to this was", "49:23", "post-modernism has been has been around", "49:27", "for decades and so there were places you", "49:30", "could go if you wanted to have an absurd", "49:32", "discussion you could go for example to", "49:35", "cultural anthropology cultural", "49:37", "anthropology was captured by", "49:38", "post-modernism thirty years ago and so", "49:41", "if you wanted to hear people say really", "49:43", "crazy things about what's true cultural", "49:46", "anthropology was a place you could do it", "49:47", "if you stepped next door to physical", "49:49", "anthropology it was just fine and so", "49:52", "anyway that's been in the university and", "49:55", "what's happened is it has been how would", "49:59", "one put it has been operationalized or", "50:01", "activated so that it is now it is now it", "50:05", "forms the core of a vision that college", "50:08", "students are trying to bring about not", "50:10", "all of them but enough of them that you", "50:13", "can't run a college without either", "50:14", "deciding to capitulate or figuring out", "50:16", "how you're gonna fight back what was", "50:21", "there a way that this could have been", "50:22", "stopped or nipped in the bud in the", "50:25", "years past or zero way that this could", "50:27", "have been sort of planned for was there", "50:30", "a lack of lack of foresight yeah this is", "50:35", "exactly it's what I was talking about a", "50:37", "few minutes ago if you if you give in to", "50:40", "the bully the bully comes back stronger", "50:42", "we've been given into the postmodern", "50:45", "bully for", "50:46", "decades and it's now come back in a form", "50:49", "that nobody knows what to do with it", "50:51", "so what was the original reason to give", "50:53", "in when it was a more mild argument well", "50:56", "because it was an abstraction hmm so", "50:59", "originally the idea that that certain", "51:05", "that based on their history certain", "51:09", "people who had been for example largely", "51:11", "shut out of the sciences were entitled", "51:13", "to think without having to deal with the", "51:17", "structures that had been built around", "51:19", "let's say men and most mostly white men", "51:22", "over the course of Western scientific", "51:24", "history so the idea that women maybe", "51:27", "needed a place to discuss what was true", "51:30", "that was not structured by men I get", "51:33", "that and in fact there's a very good", "51:36", "example in my own field where the", "51:39", "difference between the way men and women", "51:41", "I don't mean every man in every woman", "51:43", "but the difference on average I think", "51:44", "played a decisive and very positive role", "51:47", "when Louis Leakey empowered three women", "51:50", "to go study the three great apes in", "51:53", "order to figure out what's going on with", "51:55", "them and so Jane Goodall figured out", "51:57", "what was going on with the chimps", "51:58", "because she was because she was female", "52:01", "and because she didn't subscribe to the", "52:03", "rules that men had written down about", "52:05", "how you study these creatures and so it", "52:07", "is a case where something about the way", "52:09", "men look at the world had prevented", "52:10", "people like George shalour who had made", "52:14", "his mark studying lions he didn't do so", "52:17", "well with gorillas so anyway jane", "52:19", "goodall's female approach worked and it", "52:22", "it is largely the reason that we", "52:23", "understand chimps today on the other", "52:25", "hand Jane Goodall took the scientific", "52:29", "toolkit and threw out the rules that had", "52:32", "been biased rather than rejecting the", "52:34", "scientific toolkit which is what the", "52:36", "post moderns are doing which i think is", "52:38", "just tragic what we should be doing is", "52:41", "arming everybody who goes to college and", "52:44", "frankly we should be arming everybody", "52:45", "who can't go to college with a", "52:48", "scientific tool kit that lets them", "52:50", "figure out what's true especially now", "52:51", "because science is the ultimate bullshit", "52:54", "detector and you know this era is", "52:58", "you know hopefully this was peak", "52:59", "bullshit but they need the ultimate", "53:01", "bullshit detector it does seem like peak", "53:03", "bullshit right and it seems like that", "53:06", "that's one of the reasons why it's so", "53:07", "important for you to stand your ground", "53:09", "is that you you are you're being very", "53:13", "clear in what what you perceive this", "53:17", "situation to be and you're doing it in a", "53:20", "very logical and a very rational", "53:22", "well-thought-out and and clearly", "53:24", "structured way you're showing everyone", "53:27", "what's wrong with this it is a", "53:28", "scientific approach you were literally", "53:31",

"literally using you're dealing with a", "53:51", "dilemma and you're using the very tools", "53:54", "that you would like them to learn from", "53:57", "this university and take forth into the", "53:59", "world I mean it is a very scientific", "54:00", "approach you're you're saying like well", "54:03", "then no this is not that's not racism", "54:05", "and this is racism and what you're doing", "54:07", "here is actually racism right and in", "54:10", "fact you know the irony is so my", "54:13", "students and really my students many of", "54:15", "them are both my students and my

"lecture that I proposed in the letter", "63:58", "that got me in so much trouble with", "64:00", "people one of the things that I would", "64:02", "say is that the most dangerous", "64:05", "thing is that we have these latent", "64:07", "programs that are waiting for evidence", "64:09", "that it is the moment to do X Y or Z and", "64:12", "because we haven't been in those", "64:15", "circumstances

right and so that's a", "65:18", "simple one but there are other ones too", "65:20", "there are ones for for tyranny and I I", "65:23", "believe things like genocide where", "65:25", "populations that have successfully", "65:29", "eliminated other populations have done", "65:31", "well and so knowing that human beings", "65:34", "are actually wired for genocide under", "65:37", "some circumstances is well it's a", "65:41", "sobering responsibility but it's also", "65:42", "hopeful to me because if you know that", "65:44", "it's there you can figure out what", "65:46", "triggers it and you can I think we can", "65:48", "rule it out by raising people in an", "65:51", "environment where awareness of that", "65:52", "program allows us to teach them in such", "65:55", "a way that that program is

this group of", "66:05", "people is the other and that they are", "66:07", "not you and you could do horrific things", "66:10", "to them and that this is a literally a", "66:12", "part of how human beings evolved to 2017", "66:15", "how we got through all the horrific", "66:17", "things that have", "66:18", "taken place in the past and if you think", "66:20", "about the the religious innovations that", "66:26", "have occurred in the history of most of", "66:29", "the populations on earth today they", "66:31", "involve a recognition at some point", "66:33", "where the definition of self gets",

basically", "66:52", "somebody saying that some large entity", "66:55", "needs to be treated as some extension of", "66:58", "self and really this may sound funny to", "67:02", "people but if we are to survive the next", "67:05", "century as a species it's going to have", "67:08", "to be through the recognition that", "67:10", "actually all human beings are trapped on", "67:12", "one tiny little

we would all", "67:49", "realize that we are we are all in this", "67:51", "together I had no idea that he said that", "67:54", "it was a great speech because the", "67:55", "conspiracy theorist went crazy you know", "67:57", "like there's aliens man well III think", "68:00", "this is totally right and here's the", "68:02", "here's the the even better part I think", "68:04", "which is yeah if there was an alien race", "68:08", "that came to invade the earth", "68:09", "we'd rally if there was an asteroid that", "68:13", "we had enough time to know that it was", "68:15", "coming and that we would have to rally", "68:16", "together to do something about it we'd", "68:17", "do something about it and so it is", "68:19", "perfectly possible for the mechanisms", "68:21", "that evolution built

so", "68:32", "what frustrates me more than I think", "68:34", "anything else is right now we do face a", "68:38", "common enemy and that common enemy is", "68:41", "you know let's say climate change would", "68:44", "be one facet of it but it's the system", "68:46", "that set climate change in motion which", "68:48", "is also given us nuclear reactors that", "68:50", "are unstable and difficult

could", "81:54", "therefore displace something like the", "81:59", "dollar well it'd be fascinating to see I", "82:02", "mean I know that Bitcoin and blockchain", "82:04", "at a lot a lot of these

years ever ever", "82:15", "yeah so there's some momentum in that", "82:19", "regard to be nice to see them used side", "82:21", "by side you know to see if it could be", "82:24", "possible that it

"83:05", "the other problems of civilization right", "83:08", "so someone figuring out what to do with", "83:10", "nuclear waste that would be a nice one", "83:12", "that's a biggie right that's a biggie", "83:13", "and it's high on my list of of let's say", "83:19", "fears is that those nuclear reactors are", "83:22", "so dangerous by virtue of what it is", "83:24", "that keeps them stable day in and day", "83:26", "out yeah that really if people", "83:28", "understood the danger they face based on", "83:31", "on those reactors and the spent fuel", "83:32", "that they they have people would be", "83:36", "alarmed well if people just paid", "83:38", "attention to Fukushima I mean just look", "83:40", "at what's happening and know how many of", "83:42", "those there are and here's the other", "83:43", "issue you know I've talked to people", "83:45", "before and there's this I mean it's it's", "83:48", "it's really funny how when you subscribe", "83:51", "to a certain ideology whether it's a", "83:53", "liberal ideology or whether it's", "83:55", "conservative ideology you immediately", "83:56", "immediately adopt a series of beliefs", "83:59", "that go along with that and one of them", "84:02", "on the right is that nuclear power is", "84:05", "clean energy you know and my argument to", "84:07", "that has always been we've only had it", "84:10", "for sixty years and look how many places", "84:14", "you can't even go anymore", "84:15", "I mean Fukushima Chernobyl", "84:19", "what is it Three Mile Island give my", "84:21", "allowing I don't know three rounds if", "84:23", "can you go there now I wouldn't go there", "84:26", "it'd be the best of those three but we", "84:28", "also have the WIPP project in Mexico", "84:30", "yeah they're the number of places on", "84:32", "earth you can just simply no longer go", "84:33", "is growing and it's places in Nevada", "84:35", "where they just bury the waste where", "84:37", "they just bury the waste Hanford just", "84:40", "had a huge collapse so let's put it this", "84:43", "way we now know how dangerous this", "84:46", "technology is and we also know that what", "84:48", "we were told when it was invented I mean", "84:50", "everything we were told we were told", "84:52", "electricity too cheap to meter for one", "84:54", "thing we were also told we'll figure out", "84:56", "what to do with the waste no I'm no and", "84:58", "not true not true and here's what's", "84:59", "really terrifying I mean every now and", "85:01", "then we you know they're diggin in", "85:03", "Mexico City and they find some ancient", "85:05", "Aztec ruins and they have to stop", "85:06", "construction because they didn't know", "85:07", "was there what the fuck happens if 100", "85:10", "years from now they dig into the Nevada", "85:11", "desert and just tap right into a chamber", "85:15", "of spent fuel rods and kill everybody", "85:17", "well in fact that's one of the problems", "85:19", "that they've tried to solve is how do", "85:20", "you how do you make a sign yeah for", "85:23", "people you know a thousand years in the", "85:25", "future 100 years right we have no idea", "85:28", "how you would warn them off nor are", "85:32", "these things stable I mean the thing", "85:33", "about the WIPP project in New Mexico is", "85:36", "that you know this was supposed to be", "85:38", "stable for thousands of years and we had", "85:40", "this explosion that leaked plutonium", "85:44", "you know after decades the thing was not", "85:48", "stable the way we were told it was and", "85:49", "so anyway we have this terrible problem", "85:52", "and what to do with the waste you've", "85:54", "already got is obviously a huge issue", "85:55", "not making more of it would be a really", "85:57", "good idea yeah and there have been some", "86:01", "solutions that someone there was a", "86:04", "really young kid I believe that came out", "86:07", "with some radical proposal for taking", "86:09", "the nuclear waste and converting it into", "86:12", "energy that could power cities for", "86:14", "thousands of years", "86:15", "whether or not it's viable you know but", "86:17", "I mean it's totally possible I mean look", "86:21", "if we couldn't come if someone can come", "86:23", "up with nuclear energy in the first", "86:25", "place the ability to split an atom and", "86:27", "power a city maybe it is possible that", "86:30", "someone could figure out what to do with", "86:31", "that way some new sort of radical", "86:33", "approach to looking at it but you can't", "86:36", "just leave it", "86:37", "no can just keep doing what we're doing", "86:38", "over and over again and hope that we", "86:40", "don't make more spots where you can't", "86:41", "live well I mean the first thing is", "86:44", "there is one thing we can do with it", "86:46", "that's better that we already have the", "86:47", "technology to do and there's no excuse", "86:50", "for not doing it which is that all of", "86:51", "the stuff that's sitting in pools that", "86:53", "has to be actively cooled after", "86:55", "something like five years it can be put", "86:57", "in dry cask storage which ain't perfect", "87:00", "but at least it doesn't require some", "87:02", "system to actively keep it from boiling", "87:04", "over and doesn't need electricity in", "87:06", "order to cool it exactly the issue that", "87:08", "happened in Fukushima and that's", "87:09", "strictly a matter of money right we", "87:11", "could do that tomorrow we could just", "87:13", "require it and we should because it's", "87:15", "vastly safer we could also potentially", "87:18", "there are ways to take the spent fuel", "87:20", "and to burn it down that does involve", "87:22", "other kinds of reactors but ultimately", "87:25", "ultimately I can't understand why we", "87:29", "have not made an immense investment in", "87:31", "fusion power were we to discover the", "87:35", "ability to make viable fusion power", "87:37", "which I believe we know is possible we", "87:41", "not only would be able to power", "87:43", "civilization without warming the climate", "87:46", "but we would also be able to pull carbon", "87:48", "out of the atmosphere if it turns out", "87:50", "that we need to do that if you have", "87:51", "effectively an unlimited source of power", "87:53", "you can take carbon out of the", "87:55", "atmosphere and you could turn it into", "87:56", "building materials that were stable for", "87:59", "thousands of years", "88:00", "and the tiny amount that we spend on", "88:03", "fusion research is inexplicable to me", "88:06", "yeah we've gotten way away from the", "88:10", "original subject but I think this is", "88:12", "also important stuff", "88:13", "but I wanted to talk to you about", "88:14", "evolutionary biology all right and to", "88:17", "being someone who teaches that and being", "88:20", "as that's your discipline and seeing all", "88:25", "of these I mean what is it like be", "88:28", "a professor of being someone who's", "88:30", "studying this stuff and then seeing all", "88:33", "these weird traits and all these weird", "88:36", "personality aspects demonstrate", "88:39", "themselves in these times of crisis like", "88:42", "seeing these these situations you're", "88:45", "talking about people yes well that's an", "88:48", "interesting question I have become", "88:49", "fascinated I didn't start out studying", "88:51", "people but the the longer I proceed in", "88:54", "evolutionary biology the more interested", "88:55", "I am in people and let's put it this way", "89:00", "sometimes something is surprising but in", "89:03", "general if you have the right tools to", "89:05", "understand people at an evolutionary", "89:07", "level things make a certain amount of", "89:09", "sense they are I have something I say to", "89:12", "students frequently which is if a", "89:14", "situation is confusing with people very", "89:17", "often it makes more sense if you turn", "89:20", "the sound all the way down so you can't", "89:22", "hear what they're actually saying", "89:23", "because very often what's being enacted", "89:26", "between people isn't really about the", "89:28", "content of what they're saying it's", "89:30", "about something else and so let's take", "89:32", "for example my first project when I was", "89:36", "an undergraduate I was studying with a", "89:38", "very famous evolutionary biologist named", "89:41", "Bob Traverse and I wrote a paper for for", "89:45", "his class and it was about the Holocaust", "89:49", "it was about the really I was testing", "89:52", "the question at the time it was", "89:53", "relatively commonplace to hear that", "89:56", "Hitler was insane and something about", "90:00", "that didn't ring true to me and I wanted", "90:02", "to know evolutionarily speaking was he", "90:05", "insane and in studying that question it", "90:08", "became very clear that insane was the", "90:10", "wrong description that he was a monster", "90:12", "but he was a rational monster from the", "90:15", "point of view of advancing German genes", "90:20", "and that was a very troubling discovery", "90:23", "to me that in effect what he was doing", "90:27", "was I mean it's the worst thing", "90:33", "imaginable but from the point of view of", "90:35", "genes that are attempting to spread", "90:37", "across the globe and exclude alternative", "90:39", "genes from access to resources it was", "90:42", "perfectly reasonable not only what he", "90:45", "did to to Jews and homosexuals and", "90:47", "Jehovah's Witnesses", "90:49", "but the military plan the future of", "90:52", "Germany lies in Russia the idea was that", "90:55", "this was actually a sophisticated plan", "90:57", "that would have advanced the cause of", "91:01", "spreading German genes spectacularly had", "91:04", "frankly so many million Russians not", "91:07", "been ready to give their lives to turn", "91:09", "the German war machine around so what", "91:12", "I'm saying this this has to be dealt", "91:13", "with carefully because people hear you", "91:15", "say that and they think that you're", "91:16", "justifying it but you know I'm of course", "91:18", "a Jew you know whose ancestors were from", "91:22", "Europe there's there's no part of me", "91:24", "that isn't any any way okay with what", "91:26", "happened quite the opposite but", "91:28", "understanding that even though the", "91:31", "Darwinism that Hitler was deploying was", "91:34", "deformed and not not accurate and", "91:36", "defensible in a logical sense the plan", "91:40", "he was advancing was German genes", "91:43", "attempting to take over a larger", "91:45", "fraction of the the resources the planet", "91:48", "Earth has to offer than they had", "91:50", "available to them at that point in the", "91:53", "30s so anyway what I'm trying to say is", "91:58", "that there's something that we we often", "92:02", "teach students first when we get to them", "92:04", "which is called the naturalistic fallacy", "92:06", "it means that just because something is", "92:07", "true doesn't mean it's good that it", "92:09", "ought to be true and so discovering the", "92:11", "nature of something like the Holocaust", "92:13", "is very important in the sense that it", "92:15", "allows you to grapple with it logically", "92:18", "but as you're grappling with it", "92:20", "logically people want to imagine that", "92:21", "you're saying it was okay and that's the", "92:24", "opposite there are many things that are", "92:26", "true for evolutionary reasons that are", "92:28", "completely unacceptable and", "92:29", "understanding what those things are", "92:32", "gives you a pretty good shot at", "92:33", "preventing them from from unfolding it", "92:36", "is it also really is a problem when", "92:37", "something becomes taboo to even consider", "92:40", "or to look at like you you you you can't", "92:43", "look at the idea that he wasn't insane", "92:45", "and that he was in fact rational in", "92:47", "rationalizing his horrific acts and that", "92:51", "there was some sort of a plan to it all", "92:52", "and you would say that even by enacting", "92:55", "that plan you would be insane", "92:56", "in terms of how you think of the world", "92:59", "and I think of the world like if we", "93:01", "found out that Jamie over here was", "93:03", "thinking about starting a master race", "93:05", "and killing everybody off we would go", "93:06", "Jamie's gone insane I mean that's like", "93:08", "the and to say no he's not insane", "93:10", "he has a rational plan yeah like", "93:13", "immediately people would want justify", "93:16", "any horrific thing they could say about", "93:19", "you yeah just to be clear that Jamie is", "93:21", "not doing there okay I'm good guy fair", "93:23", "enough like sports how to take over he's", "93:29", "into yeah but but having taboo subjects", "93:33", "or having things you cannot consider", "93:35", "even if you're clearly not a racist", "93:37", "person even if you're clearly not a", "93:38", "person who advocates genocide the the", "93:40", "idea that intellectual discussions", "93:44", "cannot be pursued about specific topics", "93:46", "well the first thing if you're gonna go", "93:50", "into evolutionary biology especially if", "93:52", "you're gonna get anywhere near human", "93:54", "beings you have to really put aside the", "93:56", "idea of taboo and invite actual space", "93:59", "you have to be able to consider", "94:01", "everything because so much of the story", "94:03", "is you know it goes from bizarre to", "94:07", "horrifying you know there's also
