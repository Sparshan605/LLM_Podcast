["00:00", "the Joe Rogan experience and I think a", "00:03", "lot of it comes down to that we", "00:05", "shouldn't sort of protest what we", "00:07", "shouldn't agree with but we should build", "00:09", "the things we should build a future that", "00:11", "we do agree with so when you look at the", "00:14", "past few hundred years of modernity in", "00:20", "our civilization what we see is dramatic", "00:23", "positive trends in terms of health", "00:25", "wealth education violence I mean it", "00:28", "Steven Pinker on your show so I think", "00:31", "that's really really positive trends and", "00:35", "we've done a good job in that and that", "00:37", "all comes down to our ability to sort of", "00:42", "imagine things that don't exist yet so", "00:44", "sort of technology and innovation and", "00:46", "being able to work work together in an", "00:50", "effective way which is think about the", "00:52", "corporation so so I think those have", "00:56", "been a sort of very good trends and I", "00:59", "think what we should do is we should", "01:00", "also think about how to apply those to", "01:04", "the area outside of our own species and", "01:06", "to the rest of the environment because", "01:08", "when you look at all those positive", "01:10", "trends over the past few hundred years", "01:12", "and then you know that that's so good", "01:15", "but there's one very big exception which", "01:17", "is the impact to the environment it's", "01:19", "almost like we've had all the success at", "01:22", "the cost of the environment and but I", "01:24", "think that instead of there are some", "01:26", "people that have sort of a more", "01:28", "reactionary feel to this and they say", "01:30", "well look at all these problems that was", "01:34", "created by businesses and by technology", "01:37", "so we should stay as far away from those", "01:39", "things as possible and I think that's", "01:41", "sort of you know that's sort of stupid I", "01:44", "think that it really just shows that", "01:47", "these are very powerful ways of getting", "01:51", "things done and I think a much more", "01:52", "effective way was to apply that what has", "01:55", "worked in other areas and then also", "01:57", "apply that to the area of the", "01:59", "environment so so I don't think you know", "02:01", "I for example think that the car problem", "02:04", "is not going to be solved by banning", "02:05", "cars I think it's going to be solved by", "02:07", "electric cars and I don't think the the", "02:09", "meat pollution problem is going to be", "02:11", "solved by everyone becoming vegan I", "02:13", "think it's", "02:14", "going to be solved by things like", "02:16", "lab-grown meat and and other kind of", "02:18", "alternatives so and that's why I also", "02:21", "think that yeah the ocean cleanup or the", "02:24", "plastic pollution problem is not going", "02:25", "to be solved by sort of people trying to", "02:29", "do their own little bit and you know", "02:32", "trying to live without plastic or things", "02:33", "like that I think is going to be solved", "02:35", "by you know things like plastics that do", "02:39", "not harm to the environment as well as", "02:41", "technologies like the ocean clean up to", "02:43", "sort of clean up after ourselves so yeah", "02:47", "and I hope that the ocean can be sort of", "02:49", "as some a symbol of that approach you", "02:51", "had like one of the most spectacular", "02:52", "fights with John Jones I mean down to", "02:54", "the wire like is as close as it gets and", "02:57", "when you get out of a fight like that", "02:59", "will you almost won the title against", "03:02", "the greatest of all time like what is", "03:04", "what is that feeling like and where do", "03:06", "you go from there", "03:10", "you know it was tough it was really", "03:13", "tough because you know everybody was", "03:16", "saying are you winning this fight", "03:17", "winning this fight you had three rounds", "03:19", "against him are you winning this fight", "03:20", "like if it felt like and like you said", "03:24", "it was something it was just it was just", "03:27", "right there at the goal line I you know", "03:28", "I didn't really pass that go on line at", "03:31", "all I just felt like that it was tough", "03:35", "it was tough but but like now I'm", "03:38", "sitting here now talking to you it's a", "03:40", "big it's a really good experience for me", "03:42", "and and you know really it's a good time", "03:46", "for me", "03:46", "the fight was well it's a highlight in", "03:48", "my career for sure in my life for sure", "03:49", "it was such a close fight when when the", "03:52", "score cards are being tabbed and you you", "03:56", "know you're just sitting there waiting", "03:57", "for the decision did you think you had", "03:58", "it you know I didn't know right I didn't", "04:02", "know I did so much chaos could you even", "04:03", "remember what had happened over the last", "04:05", "five rounds I remember I remember I", "04:07", "remember the I remember the fight and I", "04:11", "got I remember almost at the whole fight", "04:15", "but it was just John Jones is such a", "04:17", "beast he's he you know I'm telling you", "04:21", "just for me John Jones winning over John", "04:24", "Jones is bigger than taking the belt", "04:25", "I'm telling their guys the guys is such", "04:28", "a beast and and yeah what was the", "04:33", "question", "04:33", "no it's okay be express yourself that's", "04:36", "fine", "04:37", "I mean I agree with you he is a beast we", "04:39", "had a little chalkboard sign out front", "04:40", "that said venison is the new kale and", "04:42", "you know we get cute with our sign we", "04:44", "tease other restaurants around us like", "04:46", "we have fun with the sign and it's fun", "04:47", "and this cyclists vegan rode by and took", "04:52", "huge offense to our sign and all of a", "04:56", "sudden one day these protesters just", "04:57", "showed up so originally I was just kind", "05:01", "of frustrated because they're totally", "05:03", "misguided because we take a lot of pride", "05:06", "and where our food comes from", "05:08", "we have vegan and vegetarian dishes on", "05:10", "the menu and I really respect that type", "05:14", "of diet so we were just totally floored", "05:16", "with why this was happening and so this", "05:20", "started to go on they'd started come", "05:21", "every week and they went from like two", "05:25", "or three people being kind of peaceful", "05:26", "to being like 10 15 people not so", "05:29", "peaceful so it's when it turned not so", "05:32", "peaceful they were shouting at our", "05:33", "guests and shouting in our door and", "05:36", "really trying to harm our business that", "05:38", "I just kind of got fed up last resort", "05:40", "went down we get a whole deer a couple", "05:43", "times a month and we we butchered", "05:45", "ourselves and I just said screw it screw", "05:47", "it I'm like I'm gonna get these people", "05:50", "to get out of here so I thought that", "05:51", "that would make them go away how did you", "05:54", "think that was gonna make them go away", "05:55", "not escalate it I don't know I was it", "05:58", "was just totally like last resort", "06:00", "totally fed up I wanted to defend myself", "06:03", "defend our customers you know you could", "06:05", "see people walking in visibly upset you", "06:09", "know they're being shouted at being", "06:10", "screamed at

whole", "06:31", "thing off", "06:32", "yeah I had those abilities if I'm the", "06:34", "kid growing up in this environment and I", "06:38", "I can't find refuge in my school I can't", "06:41", "find

that parent to influence you can", "06:49", "find on the streets so now I'm on the", "06:51", "streets being led by people who grew up", "06:53", "in exact conditions that I grew up in", "06:55", "and so now I'm like okay well I have to", "06:57", "make money what am I gonna do for money", "06:59", "well then there's the knock old economy", "07:00", "very conveniently right there for me", "07:02", "right so drugs so now I'm selling now", "07:05", "I'm staying on a corner selling drugs I", "07:06", "got to protect my product all right if I", "07:10", "don't someone's gonna take it from me", "07:11", "so what do I do I get a gun I carry a", "07:13", "gun now I'm stuck in a situation and in", "07:17", "this violent loop right that feeds on", "07:20", "itself and so now I'm stuck defending", "07:22", "myself against the guy who shooting at", "07:24", "me trying to take my stuff and I'm", "07:25", "shooting back at him maybe not because", "07:26", "I'm trying to take his stuff but because", "07:28", "he's trying to take mine all right so", "07:30", "that's what you get that violence that", "07:31", "comes from that from those particular", "07:33", "areas now if we would've sat back and", "07:35", "said okay we have hyper concentrated", "07:39", "areas in this country this is a", "07:41", "widespread it's hyper concentrated", "07:43", "communities in this country that are", "07:45", "dealing with this that are also the", "07:47", "result of the vast majority of our gun", "07:48", "violence if we sat back and thought", "07:50", "about from social economic standpoint", "07:52", "how do we fix this what do we do how do", "07:55", "we present opportunity I'm not saying", "07:57", "gonna just hand out stuff but how do we", "07:59", "fix this from the standpoint of", "08:00", "improving our schools how is I can draw", "08:02", "five minutes one direction and have a", "08:04", "school that has everything you can name", "08:06", "and then drive in the drive in the", "08:08", "opposite direction as cool as can barely", "08:09", "have textbooks to give to the kids hmm", "08:12", "think about that yeah so why why aren't", "08:14", "we focusing our energy on building that", "08:17", "up versus talking about oh we need to", "08:19", "get the guns off the streets you did", "08:21", "that you have that in Chicago you have", "08:23", "every gun law imaginable in Chicago but", "08:25", "yet South Chicago still looks the way", "08:27", "that it does still has a violence that", "08:29", "it does right so if we would if we", "08:31", "provide I mean you give people something", "08:34", "loose or to live for they don't throw", "08:36", "away life so easily plain and simple so", "08:39", "it's nice socioeconomic status is in the", "08:42", "dirt I don't have a problem looking at", "08:45", "another kid down the street and shooting", "08:47", "at him taking his life I don't have", "08:49", "anything", "08:50", "I'll have anything to lose but if we", "08:53", "were to focus our attention in fixing", "08:55", "that same way we talked about the mental", "08:56", "health issue with respect to mass", "08:57", "shootings then school shootings we", "09:00", "wouldn't have to worry about the guns", "09:01", "because we won't have people wanting to", "09:03", "do those things or have the capability", "09:05", "to do those things right so then that", "09:08", "deals with that vast majority of the", "09:10", "violence that we had there focusing that", "09:12", "energy in fixing those communities the", "09:15", "point of the story was this Isis came", "09:16", "around and people were suddenly like oh", "09:18", "my god where did this come from", "09:19", "of course those of us who had been", "09:21", "monitoring the situation knew this was", "09:23", "going to come back around very very", "09:25", "heavy now that Isis have been pushed", "09:27", "back and and this is where the stories", "09:29", "sort of the point of the story is we've", "09:31", "got to resist the temptation to believe", "09:32", "the problem has been solved because the", "09:35", "the organization known as Isis which is", "09:37", "an bureaucracy has been fought back but", "09:40", "the ideology upon which that", "09:42", "organization was built is still very", "09:45", "much alive and it's still strong um what", "09:48", "al-qaeda did while the whole world was", "09:50", "focused on Isis was exploit that", "09:52", "opportunity to rebuild and regroup and", "09:55", "they've been rebuilding in Syria now", "09:58", "they are stronger than they have ever", "10:00", "been even under bin Laden because for", "10:03", "the first time in the history of that", "10:04", "organization they are firmly embedded", "10:06", "within the Syrian population as they", "10:08", "genuinely kind of viewed by the people", "10:11", "that they were fighting on behalf of as", "10:13", "a grassroots resistance organization", "10:14", "whereas before that they were seen as a", "10:16", "terrorist group that was like a you know", "10:18", "just like a vanguard they've embedded", "10:20", "themselves in the Syrian population in", "10:22", "the Yemeni Civil War they've embedded", "10:24", "themselves in North Africa East Africa", "10:26", "and in Pakistan and they are resurgent", "10:29", "and they are grooming Hamza Bin Ladin", "10:31", "who is Bernard in son and they're", "10:34", "grooming him for leadership and a time", "10:36", "will come maybe in a couple of months", "10:37", "maybe in a couple of years where they", "10:39", "announce Hamza bin Laden as a new leader", "10:40", "of al-qaeda currently it's Ayman", "10:43", "Zawahiri when they do that once their", "10:45", "grooming has been complete and assuming", "10:47", "hamza isn't killed up until then all of", "10:50", "the fragments of what remains of isis", "10:53", "will probably rejoin al qaeda under", "10:55", "hamza bin Laden and you'll have a", "10:56", "stronger than ever before al Qaeda", "10:58", "organization and we've got to we've got", "11:01", "to remember that we never expected Isis", "11:03", "to emerge", "11:04", "we'll come back with a vengeance", "11:10",
