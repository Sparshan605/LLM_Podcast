"nice to meet you too thanks for not", "00:12", "lighting this place on fire you're", "00:13", "welcome", "00:15", "later how does one um just in the middle", "00:18", "of doing all the things you do", "00:19", "uh create cars uh rockets", "00:23", "all this stuff you're doing constantly", "00:25", "innovating decide to just", "00:26", "make a flamethrower where do you have", "00:28", "the time for that", "00:30", "well the family i wouldn't put we didn't", "00:32", "put a lot of time into the flamethrower", "00:34", "the this was an off-the-cuff thing and", "00:37", "um", "00:39", "so we have sort of like it's sort of a", "00:41", "sort of a hobby company", "00:43", "called the boring company uh which", "00:46", "started out as a joke and we decided to", "00:49", "make it real", "00:51", "and and dig a tunnel under la and then", "00:55", "then people other people asked us to", "00:56", "take tunnels and so we", "01:00", "said yes in a few cases and then we have", "01:03", "a merchandise section", "01:04", "that only has one piece of merchandise", "01:07", "at a time", "01:08", "and we started off with a cap and there", "01:11", "was only one thing on", "01:12", "it was just boringcompany.com cap", "01:15", "or hat that's it and and then we sold", "01:19", "the hats limited limited edition", "01:21", "it just said the boring company and then", "01:25", "i'm big fan of space balls the movie and", "01:28", "in space balls", "01:30", "yogurt goes through the merchandising", "01:33", "section", "01:34", "and they have a flamethrower in the", "01:37", "merchandising section", "01:39", "of spaceballs and", "01:42", "like the kids love that one uh that's", "01:45", "the line", "01:46", "when he pulls out the flamethrower it's", "01:47", "like we should do a flamethrower", "01:50", "so we does anybody tell you no does", "01:53", "anybody go elon", "01:54", "um maybe for yourself", "01:58", "but selling a flamethrower the", "02:00", "liabilities all the", "02:01", "people you're selling this device to", "02:03", "what kind of unhinged", "02:04", "people are going to be buying a", "02:05", "flamethrower in the first place do we", "02:07", "really want to connect ourselves", "02:09", "to all these potential arsonists yeah", "02:12", "it's a terrible idea", "02:13", "terrible i shouldn't buy one i don't i", "02:16", "said don't buy this plane thrower don't", "02:18", "buy it", "02:19", "don't buy it that's what i said but", "02:21", "still people bought it", "02:22", "yeah there's nothing i can do to staff", "02:24", "them it's building", "02:26", "i said don't buy it it's a bad idea how", "02:29", "many did you make", "02:30", "it's dangerous it's got it's wrong", "02:34", "don't buy it still people bought it i", "02:37", "just couldn't stop them", "02:38", "how many did you make 20 000", "02:43", "and they're all gone in three i think", "02:46", "four days", "02:47", "but it's sold out in four days are you", "02:49", "going to do a", "02:50", "a another run no no that's it", "02:54", "yes i said we'll do 20 we did 50 000", "02:59", "50 000 hats um", "03:02", "and and um that was a million dollars", "03:06", "and it's like okay we'll we'll sell", "03:07", "something and for 10 million", "03:10", "and that was 20 000 flamethrowers at 500", "03:13", "each", "03:16", "they went fast", "03:20", "how do you have the time to do that", "03:21", "though i mean i understand that it's not", "03:22", "a big deal", "03:24", "in terms of all the other things you do", "03:25", "but how do you have time to do anything", "03:27", "i just i don't understand your time", "03:28", "management skills", "03:31", "i i mean i didn't spend much time on on", "03:34", "this flamethrower i mean to be totally", "03:35", "frank", "03:36", "it's actually just a roofing torch with", "03:38", "an air rifle cover", "03:40", "it's not a real flamethrower which is", "03:43", "why it says not a flamethrower", "03:45", "that's why we were very clear this is", "03:47", "not actually a flamethrower", "03:48", "and and also we're told uh that various", "03:51", "countries would", "03:52", "would ban shipping of it but they would", "03:54", "not they would ban", "03:55", "flamethrowers so we very to solve this", "03:58", "problem", "03:59", "for all the customs agencies we labeled", "04:01", "it not at flamethrower", "04:03", "did it work is it effective i i i don't", "04:06", "know i think so yeah so far", "04:07", "yes now but you said you cannot serve a", "04:10", "flamethrower", "04:11", "but you do so many different things", "04:13", "forget about the flamethrower like how", "04:14", "do you do all that", "04:16", "other shit like how do you how do you", "04:17", "how does one decide", "04:19", "to fix la traffic by drilling holes in", "04:21", "the ground", "04:22", "and who do you even approach with that", "04:24", "like when you have this idea", "04:25", "who do you talk to about that i mean i'm", "04:27", "not saying it's going to be successful", "04:28", "or so", "04:29", "you know it's like asserting that it's", "04:31", "going to be successful", "04:32", "but so far i've lived in la for", "04:38", "16 years and the traffic has always been", "04:40", "terrible", "04:42", "and so i don't see any other like", "04:45", "ideas for improving the traffic", "04:48", "so in desperation we're going to take a", "04:50", "tunnel and maybe that tunnel will be", "04:52", "successful", "04:53", "and maybe it won't", "04:59", "i'm i'm listening yeah i'm not trying to", "05:02", "convince you it's going to work", "05:03", "and are the people or anyone but you're", "05:06", "you're starting this though this is", "05:08", "actually a project you're starting to", "05:10", "implement right yeah i know we've dug um", "05:13", "about a mile it's quite long it takes a", "05:16", "long time to walk it", "05:17", "yeah now when you're doing this what is", "05:19", "the ultimate plan the ultimate plan is", "05:21", "to have these", "05:21", "in major cities and anywhere there's", "05:23", "mass congestion and just try it out in", "05:25", "la first", "05:26", "yeah it's it's in l.a because uh i", "05:29", "mostly live in l.a", "05:31", "that's the reason it's a terrible place", "05:32", "to dig tunnels", "05:34", "this is one of the worst places to dig", "05:36", "tunnels because the", "05:37", "there's mostly because of the paperwork", "05:39", "people think it's like what about", "05:40", "seismic it's like", "05:41", "actually earth tunnels are very safe in", "05:44", "earthquakes", "05:45", "why is that earthquakes are", "05:48", "earthquakes are essentially a surface", "05:50", "phenomenon it's like like waves on the", "05:52", "ocean", "05:53", "so if there's a storm you want to be on", "05:56", "the", "05:56", "on in a submarine so being in a tunnel", "05:59", "is like being a submarine", "06:01", "now the way the tunnel is constructed is", "06:03", "it's constructed out of these", "06:04", "interlocking segments kind of like a", "06:07", "snake", "06:08", "it's sort of like a snake exoskeleton", "06:12", "with double seals and so", "06:16", "even when the ground moves the it's able", "06:19", "to the tunnel actually is able to shift", "06:21", "along with the ground like an", "06:23", "underground snake", "06:25", "and it doesn't crack or break or or and", "06:28", "and it's extremely unlikely that both", "06:30", "seals would be broken", "06:32", "and it's it's it's capable of taking", "06:34", "five atmospheres of pressure", "06:36", "it's waterproof methane proof or gas", "06:39", "proof of any kind", "06:41", "and uh meets all california seismic", "06:44", "requirements", "06:46", "so when you have this idea who do you", "06:47", "bring this to", "06:50", "i'm not sure what you mean by that well", "06:51", "when you you're you're implementing it", "06:53", "so you're digging holes in the ground", "06:54", "like you have to bring it to someone", "06:56", "that lets you do it yeah so", "07:00", "um there were there were some engineers", "07:03", "from spacex", "07:04", "um who were who thought it would be cool", "07:07", "to do this", "07:08", "uh and the guy who runs it like", "07:10", "day-to-day", "07:11", "steve davis he's a long-time spacex", "07:15", "engineer", "07:16", "is great um so", "07:19", "steve was like i'd like to help make", "07:22", "this happen i was like cool", "07:24", "um so we started off with", "07:27", "digging a hole in the ground it's got", "07:29", "like a permit for a pit", "07:31", "big pit and just dug a big pit and you", "07:34", "have to tell them what the pit's for or", "07:36", "you just say hey we just want to dig a", "07:37", "hole", "07:38", "nice fill out this form that's it", "07:43", "yeah i was put in our parking lot and", "07:45", "but do you have to give them some sort", "07:46", "of a blueprint for your ultimate idea", "07:49", "and do they have to approve it like how", "07:50", "does that work now we just started off", "07:52", "with a pit", "07:52", "okay big pit and um", "07:56", "now you know it's not really you know", "07:58", "don't really", "07:59", "care about the existential nature of a", "08:01", "pit you just say like i don't want a bit", "08:03", "right yeah and uh it's a hole in the", "08:06", "ground", "08:07", "so then we got the permit for the pit", "08:10", "and we dug the pit and", "08:13", "we dug in like i don't know three days", "08:16", "two three days", "08:16", "actually i think two 48 hours something", "08:18", "like that um", "08:21", "because uh eric garcetti was coming by", "08:22", "for the hype to he was going to attend", "08:24", "the hyperloop competition", "08:26", "which is like a student competition we", "08:27", "have for uh who can make the fastest pod", "08:30", "in the hyperloop", "08:31", "and uh he was coming this was good the", "08:33", "finals were going to be on sunday", "08:35", "afternoon", "08:35", "and so eric was coming by on sunday", "08:38", "afternoon was like you know we should", "08:40", "take this pit and then like show eric", "08:42", "uh so we was like friday morning", "08:46", "and then yeah so it was about a little", "08:47", "over 40 hours 40 hours later we dug the", "08:49", "pit", "08:50", "it was like when 24 7 or 24", "08:53", "48 straight hours something like that", "08:55", "and dug this big pit", "08:57", "and and and we're like showed eric the", "09:01", "pit", "09:01", "like obviously it's just a pit", "09:06", "but hey it's hole in the ground is", "09:07", "better than no hole in the ground", "09:09", "and what do you tell me about this pit i", "09:10", "mean you said this is the beginning of", "09:12", "this idea", "09:13", "yes we're going to build tunnels under", "09:14", "la to help funnel traffic better", "09:17", "and there you go and they just go okay", "09:19", "that but that", "09:20", "we've joked around about this in the", "09:21", "podcast before that like what other", "09:23", "person", "09:24", "can go to the people that run the city", "09:25", "and go hey uh we're gonna dig some holes", "09:27", "on the ground and put some tunnels in", "09:29", "there", "09:29", "and they go oh yeah okay now they know", "09:31", "where they're holding the ground but", "09:32", "it's uh", "09:33", "people think holes in the ground all the", "09:34", "time but my my question is like", "09:36", "i know how much time you must be", "09:38", "spending on your tesla factory", "09:40", "i know how much time you must be", "09:42", "spending on spacex", "09:43", "and yet you still have time to dig holes", "09:45", "under the ground in la and come up with", "09:47", "these ideas and then implement them like", "09:49", "i got a million ideas i'm sure you did", "09:51", "no shortage of that", "09:53", "yeah i just don't know how you manage", "09:54", "your time i don't understand it it", "09:56", "doesn't seem", "09:57", "it doesn't even seem humanly possible", "10:00", "you know i i do basically i think people", "10:03", "like don't", "10:04", "totally understand what i do with my", "10:06", "time", "10:07", "they think like i'm a business guy or", "10:09", "something like that", "10:10", "um like my wikipedia page says business", "10:13", "magnate what would you call yourself", "10:15", "a business magnet can someone please", "10:18", "change my wikipedia page to magnet", "10:20", "they'll change it right now it's", "10:22", "probably already changed it's locked so", "10:23", "somebody has to be able to unlock it and", "10:25", "change it to magnets", "10:26", "i want to be a magnet", "10:29", "no i i do engineering and", "10:32", "you know and manufacturing and that kind", "10:34", "of thing that's like 80 percent", "10:36", "more of my time ideas and then the", "10:38", "implementation of those ideas", "10:40", "that's like hardcore engineering like", "10:42", "yeah designing", "10:44", "things you know right", "10:47", "structural mechanical electrical", "10:49", "software", "10:51", "uh user interface engineering", "10:54", "aerospace engineering but you must", "10:57", "understand there's not a whole lot of", "10:58", "human beings like you you know that", "10:59", "right", "11:01", "you're an oddity yes to chimps like me", "11:04", "we're all chimps yeah we are we're one", "11:06", "notch we're not above a chimp", "11:08", "some of us are a little more confused", "11:09", "when i watch you doing all these things", "11:11", "i'm like how", "11:12", "does this motherfucker have all this", "11:14", "time and all this energy", "11:16", "and all these ideas and then people just", "11:18", "let them do these things", "11:20", "because i'm an alien that's what i've", "11:22", "speculated yes", "11:24", "i'm on record saying this in the past i", "11:26", "wonder", "11:27", "it's true if there was one i was like if", "11:29", "there was like maybe an intelligent", "11:31", "being that we created you know like some", "11:33", "ai", "11:34", "creature that's uh superior to people", "11:37", "maybe just hang around with us for a", "11:38", "little while like you've been doing", "11:39", "and then fix a bunch of shit maybe", "11:41", "that's the way", "11:43", "i might have some mutation or something", "11:45", "like that you might do you think you do", "11:47", "probably do you wonder like you're", "11:48", "around normal people you're like hmm", "11:53", "like what's up with these boring dumb", "11:54", "motherfuckers ever", "11:56", "not bad for a human but i", "11:59", "i think we will not be able to hold a", "12:03", "candle to ai", "12:04", "hmm you scare the shit out of me when", "12:06", "you talk about ai between you and sam", "12:08", "harris i don't even", "12:09", "consider it until at a podcast with sam", "12:12", "once", "12:12", "right he made me shit my pants talking", "12:15", "about ai i realized like oh well this is", "12:18", "a genie that once it's out of the bottle", "12:19", "you're never getting it back in", "12:21", "that's true there was a video that you", "12:24", "tweeted", "12:25", "about one of those boston dynamic robots", "12:29", "and you're like in the future it'll be", "12:32", "moving so fast you can't see it without", "12:33", "a strobe light yeah", "12:36", "you could probably do that right now and", "12:38", "no one's really uh", "12:40", "paying attention too much other than", "12:41", "people like you or people that are", "12:42", "really obsessed with technology", "12:44", "all these things are happening and these", "12:46", "robots are", "12:47", "did you see the one where peta put out a", "12:50", "statement that you shouldn't kick robots", "12:52", "it's probably not wise for retribution", "12:56", "their memory is very good i bet it's", "12:58", "really good it's really good i bet it is", "13:00", "yes and getting better every day it's", "13:02", "really good are you", "13:03", "honestly legitimately concerned about", "13:05", "this are you is like ai", "13:08", "one of your main worries in regards to", "13:11", "the future", "13:16", "yes it it's less of a worry than it used", "13:19", "to be", "13:20", "mostly due to taking more of a", "13:24", "fatalistic attitude", "13:25", "[Music]", "13:27", "so you used to have more hope and you", "13:30", "gave up some of it and now you don't", "13:32", "worry as much about ai you're like", "13:34", "this is just what it is", "13:38", "yeah pretty much yes yes", "13:41", "but no it's not necessarily bad", "13:47", "it's just it's definitely going to be", "13:48", "outside of human control", "13:51", "not necessarily bad right yeah it's not", "13:53", "it's not necessarily bad it's just", "13:56", "it's just outside of human control now", "13:57", "the thing that's going to be tricky", "14:00", "here is that it's going to be very", "14:03", "tempting to use ai as a weapon", "14:06", "it's going to be very tempting in fact", "14:07", "it will be used as a weapon", "14:12", "so the the on the the on ramp to", "14:16", "serious ai the danger is", "14:20", "going to be more humans using it against", "14:22", "each other i think", "14:24", "most likely that'll be the danger", "14:28", "yeah how far do you think we are from", "14:30", "something", "14:31", "that can make its own mind up whether or", "14:33", "not something's ethically or morally", "14:35", "correct", "14:35", "or whether or not it wants to do", "14:37", "something or whether or not it wants to", "14:38", "improve itself",

"14:52", "well i mean you could argue that any", "14:55", "group of people like it like a company", "14:59", "is essentially a cybernetic collective", "15:02", "of people and machines that's what a", "15:05", "company is", "15:09", "and then there are different", "15:13", "there's different levels of complexity", "15:15", "in the way these companies are formed", "15:18", "and then there are sort

"25:30", "what's what's the idea behind it like", "25:32", "what are you trying to accomplish with", "25:33", "it", "25:34", "like what would you like best case", "25:35", "scenario i think best case scenario we", "25:40", "effectively emerge with ai where", "25:43", "we ais serves as a tertiary", "25:46", "cognition layer uh where we've got the", "25:49", "limbic system", "25:51", "kind of the

between you", "29:14", "and the cybernetic extension of yourself", "29:16", "that is your phone", "29:18", "and computer is slow it's very slow", "29:22", "and and that that it's like a tiny straw",

then you just sort of just said okay", "31:04", "it just is", "31:05", "let's just and you in a way you're", "31:08", "by communicating the potential fear i", "31:11", "mean", "31:11", "for sure you're you're getting the", "31:13", "warning out to some people", "31:15", "yeah yeah i mean i", "31:18", "i was really going on", "31:21", "the warning quite quite a lot i was", "31:26", "warning everyone i could even met with", "31:29", "obama and", "31:30", "just for one reason like just talk about", "31:33", "ai", "31:33", "yes and what did he say so what about", "31:36", "hillary", "31:37", "worry about her first shh everybody", "31:39", "crying no", "31:40", "he listened he suddenly listened um", "31:44", "i met with congress i met with", "31:47", "i was at a meeting of all 50 governors", "31:51", "and talked about just ai danger", "31:55", "and i talked to everyone i could", "32:00", "no one seemed to realize where this was", "32:03", "going", "32:05", "is it that or do they just assume that", "32:07", "someone smarter than them has already", "32:08", "taken care of it", "32:10", "because when people hear about something", "32:11", "like ai it's almost abstract",

they didn't quite", "32:26", "understand it or didn't think it was", "32:28", "near term or", "32:31", "not sure what to do about it when i said", "32:33", "like you know an obvious thing to do is", "32:35", "to just", "32:36", "establish a committee", "32:39", "government committee to gain insight you", "32:42", "know before", "32:43", "before you oversight before you do make", "32:46",

"32:56", "to speed then they can make", "32:58", "maybe some rules or propose some rules", "33:02", "and and that would be probably a safer", "33:04", "way to go about things", "33:06", "it seems i mean i know that it's", "33:08", "probably something that the government's", "33:10", "supposed to handle", "33:11", "but it seems like i wouldn't want the i", "33:13", "don't want the government to handle this", "33:15", "who do you want to i want you to handle", "33:16", "it oh geez yeah i feel like you're the", "33:19", "one who could ring the bell better", "33:20", "because if if mike pence starts talking", "33:22", "about hey i'm like shut up bitch you", "33:24", "don't know anything about ai", "33:26", "come on man he doesn't know what he's", "33:27", "talking about but i don't have the power", "33:29", "to regulate", "33:30", "other companies what am i supposed to do", "33:32", "right but maybe companies could agree", "33:34", "maybe there could be some sort of a", "33:36",

terribly", "33:45", "damaging even though they'd be", "33:46", "profitable maybe this is one of those", "33:48", "things maybe you should realize that you", "33:49", "can't hit the switch on something that's", "33:51", "going to be able to think for", "33:52", "itself and make up its own mind as to", "33:53", "whether or not it wants to survive or", "33:54", "not", "33:55", "and whether or not it thinks you're a", "33:56", "threat", "33:58", "and whether or not it thinks you're", "33:59", "useless like why do i keep this", "34:02", "dumb finite life form alive", "34:05", "why why keep this thing around it's just", "34:07", "stupid it just keeps polluting", "34:09", "everything it's shitting everywhere it", "34:10", "goes", "34:11", "lighting everything on fire and shooting", "34:12",

beautiful", "34:20", "art and sometimes you know sometimes", "34:22", "it's cool to hang out with", "34:24", "like yeah all those reasons yeah for us", "34:26", "those are great reasons", "34:27", "yes but for anything objective standing", "34:28", "outside like oh this is definitely a", "34:30", "flawed system", "34:31", "this is like if you went to the jungle", "34:32", "and you watch these chimps engage in", "34:34", "warfare and beat each other", "34:35", "with music they're fucking really mean", "34:37", "fucking mean they're real meaning i saw", "34:38", "that movie chimpanzee yeah i thought it", "34:39", "was gonna be like some disney things", "34:40", "like holy", "34:41", "cow what movie was that it's literally", "34:43", "called chimpanzee", "34:44", "is it a documentary yeah yeah it's kind", "34:46", "of like a documentary i was like", "34:48", "damn these chimps are mean they're mean", "34:51", "yeah they're cruel yeah they're they're", "34:54", "they're calculated", "34:55", "yeah yeah they sneak up on each other", "34:57", "and like i didn't realize chimps did", "34:59", "calculated cruelty mm-hmm yeah that's", "35:02", "pretty", "35:04", "ah i left that meeting kind of thinking", "35:05", "whoa this is dark", "35:07", "right well we know better because we've", "35:08", "advanced but", "35:10", "if we hadn't we'd be like man i don't", "35:12", "want to fucking live in a house i like", "35:14", "the chimp ways bro chimp ways to go", "35:16", "this is it man chimp life", "35:20", "i know but we in a way to the ai", "35:24", "might be like those chimps i'm like", "35:26", "these stupid fucks", "35:27", "launching missiles out of drones and", "35:30", "shooting each other under water", "35:31", "like we're crazy we got torpedoes and", "35:34", "submarines and fucking", "35:36", "airplanes that drop nuclear bombs", "35:38", "indiscriminately on cities", "35:39", "we're assholes", "35:43", "yeah they might go why are they doing", "35:45", "this it might like look at our politics", "35:48", "look at what we do in terms of our our", "35:51", "food system", "35:52", "what what kind of food we force down", "35:54", "each other's throats", "35:56", "and they might go these people are crazy", "35:57", "they don't even look out for themselves", "35:59", "i don't know i mean how much do we think", "36:00", "about chimps not much very little", "36:03", "it's like these terms are at war", "36:06", "these like little it's like groups of", "36:09", "chimps just", "36:10", "attack each other and they kill each", "36:12", "other", "36:13", "and they torture each other that's", "36:14", "pretty bad um they hunt monkeys", "36:18", "uh they're but like this is probably the", "36:22", "most", "36:23", "that's you know i mean when's the last", "36:25", "time you talk about chimps", "36:27", "me yeah all the time you do talking to", "36:29", "them okay", "36:30", "fucking podcast dude", "36:33", "okay people are laughing right

people", "38:40", "is that", "38:44", "i think maybe particularly instagram um", "38:47", "people look like they have a much better", "38:49", "life", "38:50", "than they really do right so by design", "38:54", "yeah people are posting pictures of when", "38:57", "they're really happy", "38:58", "they're modifying those pictures to be", "39:00", "better looking", "39:02", "even if they're not modifying the", "39:03", "pictures they're at least selecting the", "39:04", "pictures for the best lighting the best", "39:06", "angle", "39:09", "so people basically seem uh", "39:12", "they're way better looking than they", "39:14", "basically really are right", "39:16", "um and they're way happier seeming", "39:19", "than they really are so if you look at", "39:21", "everyone on instagram you might think", "39:23", "man they're all these happy beautiful", "39:25", "people", "39:26", "and i'm not that good looking and i'm", "39:29", "not happy", "39:30", "so i'm a suck you know and

i think i think things like that", "40:06", "can make people quite sad", "40:08", "just by comparison because you you sort", "40:10", "of you people people generally", "40:12", "think of themselves

doing", "41:25", "i know what you're doing too they're", "41:27", "they're they're letting you know", "41:29", "and then they're feeding off that", "41:30", "comment section", "41:34", "sitting there

that seems we have that", "42:33", "htc vive here and", "42:35", "i've only done it a couple times quite", "42:36", "honestly because it kind of freaks me", "42:38", "out sure", "42:38", "my kids fucking love it man they love it", "42:41", "they love playing these weirdo games and", "42:44", "and walking around with that headset on", "42:46", "but part of me watching them do it goes", "42:48",

cell phone yeah you compare", "42:57", "that to like a galaxy note 9.", "42:59", "how the fuck did that become that right", "43:01", "and i wonder when i see this htc vive", "43:03", "i'm like", "43:04", "what is that thing going to be 10 years", "43:06", "from now when we're making fun of what", "43:08", "it is now", "43:09", "what is it how i mean how ingrained", "43:12", "and how how how connected and", "43:15", "interconnected", "43:16", "is this technology going to be in our", "43:17", "life", "43:21", "it will be at some point", "43:24", "indistinguishable from reality where", "43:27", "we'll lose this", "43:28", "we lose this like you and i are just", "43:30", "looking at each other through our eyes i", "43:31", "see", "43:31", "where you see me i think i hope you", "43:33", "think so i think you probably have a", "43:34", "regular eyes", "43:36", "this could be some simulation it could", "43:38", "do you entertain that", "43:43", "well the argument for the simulation i", "43:46", "think is quite strong", "43:48", "because if you assume any improvements", "43:50", "at all", "43:51", "over time any improvement one percent", "43:54", "point one percent just extend the time", "43:56", "frame make it a thousand years", "43:58", "a million years the universe is 13.8", "44:00", "billion years old", "44:02", "what would a civilization if you counted", "44:05", "if you're very generous", "44:07", "civilization is maybe seven or eight", "44:10", "thousand years old", "44:11", "if you count it from the first writing", "44:13", "this is nothing", "44:14", "this is nothing", "44:17", "so if you assume any rate of improvement", "44:21", "at all then", "44:24", "games will be indistinguishable from", "44:27", "reality", "44:31", "or civilization will end one of those", "44:33", "two things will occur", "44:37", "therefore we are most likely in a", "44:38", "simulation or", "44:40", "we're on our way to one right well just", "44:43", "because we exist", "44:44", "we could most certainly be on the road", "44:46", "we could be on the road to that", "44:48", "right it doesn't mean that it has to be", "44:50", "reality it could be in base reality we", "44:52", "could be", "44:53", "here now on our way to the road", "44:57", "or on our way to the destination where", "44:59", "this can never happen again", "45:01", "where we are completely ingrained in", "45:03", "some sort of an artificial technology or", "45:05", "some sort of a symbiotic relationship", "45:07", "with", "45:07", "the internet or the next level of", "45:10", "sharing information", "45:11", "but right now we're not there yet that's", "45:13", "possible too right it's possible that a", "45:15", "simulation is", "45:16", "one day going to be inevitable that", "45:17", "we're going to have something that's", "45:18", "indistinguishable from regular reality", "45:20", "but maybe we're not there yet that's", "45:22", "also possible", "45:24", "so we're not quite there yet that this", "45:26", "is real", "45:27", "when i touch that it feels very real", "45:29", "maybe that's why everybody's like into", "45:30", "like mason jars and shit", "45:32", "amazing suede shoes people are going to", "45:34", "like craft restaurants and", "45:36", "they want raw wood everyone says", "45:38", "everyone wants to see metal", "45:39", "people it seems like people are like", "45:40", "longing towards some weird", "45:42", "log cabin type nostalgia reality yeah", "45:45", "like holding on like", "45:47", "clinging just dragging their nails", "45:49", "through the mud like don't take me yet", "45:51", "yes but then but then people go get a", "45:54", "mason jar with a wine stem", "45:55", "or a handle that's dark", "46:00", "makes me lose faith in humanity wine", "46:01", "stem and a handle they have those yes", "46:03", "oh those dirty people that's just", "46:05", "assholes that's like people make pet", "46:07", "rocks rough", "46:08", "right some people are just assholes they", "46:10", "take advantage of our", "46:11", "our generous nature it was made with a", "46:14", "wine stem", "46:15", "made with a handle they made it that way", "46:18", "yes", "46:18", "so the the it wasn't like well on to the", "46:21", "mason ah that would be fine if there was", "46:24", "they glued it on or something right", "46:28", "white trash chic oh this is disgusting", "46:30", "look at this it is right there", "46:31", "yep this is terrible", "46:35", "yeah that's like fake breasts that are", "46:38", "designed to be hard like fake breasts", "46:40", "from the 60s", "46:44", "it's like if you really along for the", "46:46", "ones with ripples here we go", "46:49", "yeah that's almost what that is yeah", "46:52", "what are you going to do man there's not", "46:53", "nothing you know something you do stop", "46:56", "certain terrible ideas from propagating", "46:59", "yeah um", "47:03", "anyway i don't sound like things are too", "47:05", "dark because i think like", "47:06", "you kind of have to", "47:09", "be optimistic about the future there's", "47:11", "no point in being", "47:12", "pessimistic it's just too negative", "47:16", "it doesn't help you know i think you", "47:18", "want to be", "47:20", "i mean my theory is like you'd rather be", "47:22", "optimistic", "47:24", "i think i'd rather be optimistic and", "47:25", "wrong than pessimistic and right", "47:28", "right at least or on that side right", "47:31", "yeah", "47:31", "because if you're pessimistic it's going", "47:33", "to be miserable", "47:34", "yeah yeah nobody wants to be around you", "47:37", "anyway if it's the end of the world", "47:39", "you're like i", "47:40", "told you bro yeah the world's ending", "47:43", "yeah it is what it is for all i mean", "47:47", "enjoy the journey right if you really", "47:48", "want to get morose i mean it is", "47:51", "what it is for all of us anyway we're", "47:53", "all going to go unless some", "47:54", "something changes yeah i mean ultimately", "47:58", "you know even if we just sort of existed", "48:00", "as humans forever we'd be", "48:03", "would still eventually be like the heat", "48:05", "death of the universe right a zillion", "48:07", "years from now", "48:08", "right even if we get it past the sun if", "48:10", "we figure out a way past the sun", "48:12", "running out of juice eventually it's", "48:14", "going to end it's just a question of", "48:15", "when", "48:16", "right so it really is all about the", "48:18", "journey hmm", "48:20", "or transcendence from whatever we are", "48:23", "now", "48:23", "into something that doesn't worry about", "48:24", "death", "48:27", "the universe as we know it will", "48:29", "dissipate", "48:31", "into a fine mist

"dimension", "48:42", "it's just a very long time so i think", "48:44", "it's really just about", "48:46", "how can we make it last longer are you", "48:49", "a proponent of the multi-universes", "48:51", "theory do you believe that there are", "48:53", "many many universes and that even if", "48:54", "this one", "48:55", "fades out that there's other ones that", "48:56", "are starting fresh right now and there's", "48:58", "an infinite number of them", "49:00", "and they're just constantly in this", "49:01", "never-ending cycle of birth and death", "49:08", "i think most likely this is just about", "49:10", "probability there", "49:11", "are many many simulations", "49:15", "these simulations are you might as well", "49:17", "call them reality", "49:18", "or you could call them multiverse these", "49:20", "simulations you believe are created", "49:22", "like someone has manufactured running on", "49:24", "the substrate", "49:26", "so that substrate is probably boring", "49:29", "boring", "49:30", "how so well when we create a simulation", "49:35", "like a game or a movie it's a", "49:37", "distillation of what's interesting about", "49:39", "life", "49:40", "you know it takes take a year to shoot", "49:44", "an action movie", "49:46", "and then that's all to slow down into", "49:47", "two or three hours", "49:50", "so let me tell you if you see an action", "49:51", "movie being filmed it's freaking it's", "49:53", "boring", "49:54", "super boring it takes there's like", "49:58", "lots of takes there's everything's in a", "49:59", "green screen", "50:01", "looks pretty goofy doesn't look cool but", "50:04", "once you add the cgi", "50:05", "and have great editing it's amazing", "50:10", "so i think most likely", "50:15", "if we're a simulation it's really boring", "50:18", "outside the simulation", "50:21", "because why would you make a simulation", "50:22", "that's boring it makes simulation way", "50:24", "more interesting than the base reality", "50:26", "that is if this right now is a", "50:28", "simulation yes", "50:30", "and ultimately inevitably we're if as", "50:33", "long as we don't die or get hit by a", "50:34", "meteor", "50:35", "we're going to create some sort of", "50:37", "simulation if we continue on the same", "50:38", "technological path where", "50:40", "we're on right now yes but we might not", "50:42", "be there yet", "50:43", "so it might not be a simulation here", "50:46", "but it most likely is you feel other", "50:49", "places", "50:52", "this notion of place or where is is", "50:55", "a flawed yes flawed", "50:58", "like that if you have this sort of", "51:01", "that uh vive you know", "51:04", "which that's made by valve and", "51:08", "st and it's really valve that made it", "51:10", "htc did the hardware but it's really a", "51:12", "valve thing", "51:13", "um makers of half-life yes", "51:18", "wow great company great company um", "51:23", "uh when you're in the", "51:26", "in that some in that your virtual", "51:29", "reality", "51:30", "which is only going to get better where", "51:34", "are you where are you really", "51:36", "right you aren't anywhere well where is", "51:39", "the computer", "51:40", "what what you know what defines where", "51:41", "you are exactly right it's your", "51:43", "perception", "51:44", "is it your perceptions or is it you know", "51:46", "a

think", "52:06", "about this all the time", "52:09", "yeah i mean it's unquestionable that one", "52:12", "day that'll be the case", "52:14", "as long as we keep going as long as", "52:16", "nothing interrupts us", "52:17", "and if we start from scratch and", "52:20", "you know we're single-celled organisms", "52:22", "all over again and then", "52:24", "millions and millions of years later we",

ideas", "52:51", "and expression all through technology", "52:56", "yeah and then we're one we're gonna", "52:58", "wonder", "52:59", "like why are we here what are we doing", "53:03", "let's find out well", "53:06", "i i mean i think we should take the", "53:08", "actions", "53:09", "the set of actions that are most likely", "53:11", "to make the future better", "53:14", "yes right yeah right right", "53:17", "and then we evaluate those actions to", "53:18", "make sure they're they're that", "53:20", "it's true well i think there's a", "53:22", "movement to that i mean in terms of like", "53:24", "a social movement", "53:25", "i think some of it's misguided and some", "53:26", "of it's exaggerated and there's a lot of", "53:29", "a lot of people that are fighting for", "53:30", "their

play music", "56:42", "i was like that sounds great please do", "56:45", "it", "56:47", "let's try to get it done in time for", "56:48", "christmas we did is there a concern", "56:50", "about someone", "56:51", "just losing their mind and making it do", "56:53", "that on the highway", "56:54", "no it won't do that what if it's in", "56:56", "bumper-to-bumper traffic", "56:58", "nope no

the most fun thing you could possibly", "58:06", "buy ever", "58:09", "that's what it's meant to be well our", "58:11", "goal is to make", "58:13", "it's it's not exactly a car", "58:16", "it's actually a thing to maximize", "58:19", "enjoyment", "58:25", "electronic like big screen laptop", "58:28", "ridiculous speed handling all that stuff", "58:33", "yeah do you you have going to put video", "58:35", "games in it", "58:36", "you are yeah is that wise well", "58:40", "you won't be able to drive while you're", "58:42", "playing the video game", "58:43", "but we're like for example we just we're", "58:45", "just putting the the atari emulator raw", "58:47", "emulator in it", "58:48", "so you'll be able to play missile", "58:49", "command and lunar lander and a bunch of", "58:51", "other things", "58:52", "yeah that sounds cool it's pretty fun i", "58:55", "like that yeah and we improved the", "58:56", "interface and missile command because", "58:57", "it's too hard with the old trackball", "58:59", "so this is this is a touchscreen version", "59:02", "of missile command", "59:03", "so you have a chance", "59:04", "[Laughter]", "59:07", "do you you have an old

"59:18", "it's great", "59:18", "yeah i love old cars that's one of the", "59:22", "only", "59:22", "yeah the only two got only two gasoline", "59:24", "cars i have of that", "59:25", "and an old like a ford model t", "59:29", "that a friend of mine gave me that's", "59:31", "those are only two gasoline cars", "59:33", "is the ford model t all stock well oh", "59:35", "there's your car", "59:36",

nailed that that's what mine", "59:57", "looks like", "59:59", "maybe that is mine there's certain", "60:00", "iconic shapes", "60:02", "yes and there's there's something about", "60:05", "those cars too they're not as capable", "60:07", "not nearly as capable as like a tesla", "60:10", "but there's something", "60:11", "really satisfying about the mechanical", "60:13", "aspect of like feeling the steering and", "60:15", "the", "60:16", "grinding of the gears and the shifting", "60:20", "there's something about those that's", "60:21", "extremely satisfying even though they're", "60:23", "not that competent", "60:24", "like i have a 1993 porsche", "60:28", "964 it's like a lightweight", "60:31", "it's not it's in the rs america it's not", "60:33", "very fast it's not like in comparison to", "60:35", "a tesla or anything like that", "60:36", "but the thing about it is like it's", "60:38", "mechanical", "60:39", "you feel it everything's like", "60:43", "it's like it gives you this weird thrill", "60:46", "like you're on this", "60:47", "clinky ride and there's all this", "60:49", "feedback", "60:51", "there's something to that yeah yeah", "60:53", "absolutely i mean", "60:54", "yeah my e-type is like basically no", "60:57", "electronics", "60:58", "yeah um you like that but you also like", "61:01", "electronics", "61:03", "yes like your tesla is supe it's like", "61:06", "the far", "61:06", "end of electronics yes", "61:10", "drives itself it's driving itself better", "61:12", "every day", "61:14", "yeah it's like we're about to release", "61:16", "the software that", "61:18", "will enable you to just turn it on and", "61:20", "it'll drive from highway on-ramp to", "61:22", "highway exit do lane changes", "61:24", "to overtake other cars jesus go from one", "61:26", "interchange to the next if you get on", "61:28", "say the 405 and get on get off 300 miles", "61:32", "later and go through several highway", "61:34", "interchanges and just", "61:35", "overtake other cars and hook into the", "61:37", "nav system", "61:40", "and then uh and you're just meditating", "61:42", "home", "61:44", "yeah your car's just traveling very it's", "61:46", "kind of eerie", "61:48", "it's kind of eerie what did you think", "61:49", "when you saw that video that dude", "61:50", "falling asleep behind the wheel", "61:52", "i'm sure you've seen it the one in san", "61:54", "francisco he's like right outside of san", "61:55", "jose dudes out cold like this", "61:58", "and the car is in bumper to bumper", "61:59", "traffic moving along yeah", "62:01", "have you seen it right yeah yeah we", "62:04", "changed the software we changed the", "62:06", "software", "62:07", "that's i think an old video we changed", "62:08", "software if if you don't touch the wheel", "62:10", "it will gradually slow down and put the", "62:13", "emergency lights on", "62:14", "and wake you up oh that's hilarious yeah", "62:17", "that's hilarious", "62:18", "yeah can you choose what voice wakes you", "62:20", "up well it's sort of more of a", "62:23", "it sort of honks oh it honks this should", "62:25", "be like wake up fuck face", "62:27", "well you're endangering your fellow", "62:28", "humans we could we could gently wake you", "62:30", "up with a sultry voice", "62:31", "ah that would be good like uh something", "62:33", "with a southern accent", "62:35", "hey why can't we wake up sunshine hey", "62:37", "sweetie", "62:38", "exactly why don't you wake up you're", "62:40", "like pick you could pick your", "62:42", "right like what do you want yeah i", "62:44", "choose the australian girl for siri yeah", "62:46", "i like her voice do you want to seduce", "62:47", "my favorite", "62:49", "i like australian what flavor of do you", "62:51", "want to be angry could be anything", "62:52", "you want those australian prison lady", "62:54", "jeans now when you", "62:55", "um when you program something like that", "62:57", "in is this in response to", "62:59", "a concern or is it your own yeah if you", "63:02", "do you look at it and go hey", "63:03", "um they shouldn't just be able to fall", "63:05", "asleep let's wake them up", "63:08", "yeah yeah we it's like you know we're", "63:11", "like well", "63:12", "you know people are just falling asleep", "63:14", "we're about to do something about that", "63:16", "right but when you first released it you", "63:18", "didn't consider it right you're just", "63:19", "like well", "63:20", "no one's gonna just sleep people fall", "63:22", "asleep in", "63:23", "cars all the time all the time and crash", "63:25", "yeah at least our car doesn't crash", "63:27", "that's better", "63:28", "it's better not to crash imagine if that", "63:30", "guy had fallen asleep in a in a gasoline", "63:32", "car they do it", "63:33", "all the time for sure yeah they would", "63:35", "crash into somebody yeah", "63:37", "and in fact the thing that really you", "63:40", "know", "63:40", "got me to it's like man we better get", "63:43", "autopilot going get it out there", "63:45", "it was a guy was in an early tesla", "63:49", "driving down the highway and he fell", "63:50", "asleep and he ran over a cyclist and", "63:52", "killed him", "63:54", "and it's like i was like man if we had", "63:56", "autopilot", "63:58", "wouldn't run out of one we might have", "63:59", "fallen asleep but at least he wouldn't", "64:00", "run over that cyclist", "64:04", "so how did you implement it like did you", "64:06", "just use cameras", "64:07", "and yeah programmed with the the system", "64:11", "so that if it sees images", "64:13", "it slows down and how much time do you", "64:16", "give", "64:18", "is the person who's in control of it", "64:20", "allowed to program how fast it goes", "64:22", "yes yeah you can program it to be more", "64:25", "or less", "64:26", "like more conservative like more", "64:28", "aggressive driver", "64:30", "um and you can say what speed you want", "64:33", "it to", "64:34", "what what speed is okay i know you have", "64:36", "ludicrous mode do you have douchebag", "64:38", "mode", "64:40", "well it just cuts people off well", "64:44", "for lane changes it's tricky because if", "64:46", "you're in like", "64:48", "la like unless you're pretty aggressive", "64:50", "right it's pretty it's hard to change", "64:51", "lanes", "64:52", "it's hard to be sat nam it's hard to be", "64:54", "namaste", "64:56", "out here in l.a yeah you get if you want", "64:57", "to hit that santa monica boulevard", "64:59", "off-ramp i mean you got to be a little", "65:01", "pushy you got to be a little pushy", "65:03", "yeah especially angry yeah a little", "65:05", "angry they don't want you in they speed", "65:07", "up", "65:07", "sometimes you know i think people like", "65:10", "overall are pretty nice on the highway", "65:12", "even in la but", "65:13", "sometimes they're not do you think the", "65:14", "neural link will help that", "65:16", "probably everybody be locked in together", "65:19", "this hive mind", "65:20", "tunnels will help it won't have traffic", "65:23", "that'll help a lot", "65:24", "yeah how many of those can you put in", "65:25", "there because thinking about traveling", "65:27", "buddy", "65:28", "nice thing about tunnels is you can go", "65:29", "3d so you can go", "65:31", "many levels right so until you hit hell", "65:34", "yeah but you could go you could have a", "65:36", "hundred levels of tunnel no bombs", "65:38", "jesus christ i don't want to be on 99.", "65:41", "that'll be the 99th", "65:42", "negative 99 floors whoo", "65:45", "this is one of the fundamental things", "65:47", "people don't appreciate about", "65:49", "tunnels is that it's not like roads the", "65:50", "fundamental issue with roads is that you", "65:52", "have a 2d", "65:53", "transport system and a 3d living and", "65:57", "workspace environment", "65:58", "so you got all these tall buildings or", "66:01", "concentrated work environments and", "66:04", "and then then you want to go into this", "66:07", "like 2d transport system which is hugely", "66:09", "inefficient pretty low density", "66:10", "because cars are spaced out pretty far", "66:14", "and and so that obviously is not going", "66:16", "to work you're going to have traffic", "66:18", "guaranteed", "66:19", "but if you can go 3d on your transport", "66:21", "system", "66:22", "then you can solve all traffic you can", "66:25", "either go 3d", "66:26", "up with a flying car or go 3d down with", "66:29", "tunnels", "66:30", "you can have as many tunnel levels as", "66:32", "you want and you can", "66:33", "arbitrarily relieve any amount of", "66:36", "traffic", "66:37", "you can go further down with tunnels", "66:39", "than you can go up with buildings", "66:41", "you're ten thousand feet down if you", "66:42", "want", "66:45", "i wouldn't recommend it but what was", "66:46", "that movie with uh", "66:48", "what's his face bradley coote not", "66:50", "bradley cooper", "66:52", "uh christian no what the fuck's his name", "66:54", "who is batman", "66:56", "christian bale where he they fought", "66:58", "dragons him and matthew

"67:09", "rain of fire rain of fire okay ever saw", "67:11", "that", "67:12", "no", "67:21", "yeah earth is a giant ball of lava", "67:25", "with a thin crust on the top which we", "67:28", "think of

package", "68:45", "yeah what what the fuck do you need to", "68:47", "put rocket thrusters on it", "68:49", "for real yes what are they to burn", "68:51", "nothing uh high", "68:53", "ultra high

"69:26", "i mean if you get like one of those like", "69:28", "toy drones", "69:29", "think of how much how loud those are and", "69:32", "how much", "69:33", "air that they how much air they blow

the", "70:07", "ufo technology they were doing it area", "70:10", "51", "70:11", "remember didn't they have some some", "70:12", "thoughts about magnetics", "70:14", "nope no bullshit yes really yeah there's", "70:17", "a fundamental momentum exchange", "70:19", "with the air so you must uh", "70:23", "you you must accelerate you there's", "70:25", "there's like", "70:26", "there's there's a certain you have a", "70:28", "mass and you have gravity gravitational", "70:29", "acceleration", "70:32", "and mass mass times your mass times", "70:36", "gravity must equal the mass of airflow", "70:38", "times the acceleration of that air flow", "70:40", "to have a neutral force so it's", "70:42", "impossible", "70:43", "and then you won't move but if okay if", "70:45", "mg is greater than m a", "70:47", "you will go down and if ma is greater", "70:50", "than mg you will go up", "70:52", "that's how it works there's just no way", "70:54", "around that there is definitely no way", "70:55", "around it", "70:56", "there's no way to create some sort of a", "70:57", "magnetic something or another that", "70:59", "allows you to", "71:02", "technically yes you you could have", "71:05", "a strong enough magnet", "71:11", "but that magnet would be so strong", "71:14", "that you would create a lot of trouble", "71:16", "we just suck cars up into your car", "71:20", "just pick up i mean you'd have to rappel", "71:23", "off of either", "71:26", "material on the ground or", "71:30", "in a really nutty situation off of", "71:33", "earth's gravitational field", "71:35", "and somehow make that incredibly light", "71:38", "but that magnet would cause so much", "71:40", "destruction you'd be better off with a", "71:43", "helicopter so if there was some sort of", "71:46", "magnet road like you have two magnets", "71:49", "and they repel each other", "71:50", "if you had some sort of a magnet road", "71:52", "that was below you and you could travel", "71:54", "on that magnet road that would work", "71:57", "hahaha yes", "72:01", "yes you could have a magnet road a", "72:03", "magnet road is that too ridiculous", "72:05", "no it would work so you could do that", "72:06", "ridiculous too right i would not", "72:08", "recommend it", "72:09", "there's a lot of things i don't", "72:10", "recommend i would super not recommend", "72:12", "that", "72:13", "not good not wise i think no roads no", "72:18", "no that no definitely not", "72:21", "definitely it was good that would cause", "72:22", "a lot of trouble so you've put some time", "72:24", "and consideration into this other than", "72:26", "uh", "72:26", "you know instead of like my", "72:30", "foolishly rendered thoughts so you think", "72:32", "that tunnels are the way to do it", "72:33", "oh it'll work for sure that'll work yes", "72:36", "and your these", "72:40", "these tunnels that you're building right", "72:41", "now these are basically just like test", "72:42", "versions of this", "72:43", "ultimate idea that you have", "72:46", "you know it's just a hole in the ground", "72:48", "right we played videos of it", "72:51", "where you just your idea is that you're", "72:52", "going to drop that hole in the ground", "72:54", "there's a sled on it and the sled goes", "72:56", "very fast like 100 miles an hour plus", "72:58", "yeah you can go real fast you know fast", "72:59", "as you want", "73:01", "and then if you want to go long", "73:02", "distances you can just draw the air out", "73:04", "of the tunnel", "73:05", "make sure it's real straight draw the", "73:08", "air out of the tunnel yeah", "73:09", "it's a vacuum tunnel um because the", "73:13", "then and then depending on how fast you", "73:15", "want to go you need these wheels", "73:17", "or you could use air bearings depending", "73:19", "upon the ambient pressure in the tunnel", "73:21", "or you could", "73:23", "mag levitt if you want to go super fast", "73:26", "um so magnet road yes", "73:30", "but underground magnet roads underground", "73:31", "manual otherwise you're going to really", "73:33", "create a lot of trouble with because", "73:34", "there's metal things ah", "73:36", "so magnet road's the way to go just", "73:38", "underground if you want to go really", "73:40", "fast", "73:41", "underground you would be in you would be", "73:44", "maglev in a vacuum tunnel", "73:46", "mag in a vacuum tunnel magnetic", "73:48", "levitation in a vacuum tunnel", "73:51", "one with rocket launchers no i would not", "73:53", "recommend putting any", "73:55", "exhaust gas in the tunnel oh okay i see", "73:58", "what you're saying you're going to pump", "73:59", "it out", "74:00", "right you'll have to pump it out and you", "74:01", "probably have a limited amount of air in", "74:03", "the first place like how much can you", "74:04", "breathe", "74:04", "do you have to pump oxygen into these", "74:06", "cubicles", "74:08", "you'd have a pressurized pot to be like", "74:09", "like a little tiny underground spaceship", "74:11", "basically like an airplane", "74:14", "because you have air in the airplane", "74:15", "it's not getting new air in it is", "74:17", "it is yes they have like a little hole", "74:19", "yeah they have a pump", "74:20", "really yeah it gets it from the outside", "74:22", "yes wow i didn't know that it's like", "74:24", "it's the air is airplanes have it have", "74:26", "it", "74:27", "easy because they essentially you can", "74:29", "they're pretty leaky", "74:31", "uh but jesus yeah so long as they", "74:35", "as long as the air pump is working at a", "74:38", "decent speed they have backup pumps", "74:39", "oh still have like you know three pumps", "74:41", "or four pumps or something", "74:42", "and uh and then that then there's like", "74:45", "there's an ex", "74:46", "it exhausts through the outflow valve", "74:50", "and and through whatever seals are not", "74:53", "sealing quite right", "74:54", "usually the door doesn't seal quite", "74:56", "right on a plane this is a bit of", "74:57", "leakage around the door", "74:59", "and uh and but the pumps", "75:02", "uh exceed the outflow rate and then that", "75:05", "sets the pressure in the in the cabin", "75:07", "now have you ever looked at planes and", "75:10", "gone i could fix this", "75:12", "i just don't have time how does it make", "75:13", "it design for a plane", "75:15", "you do yes a better design", "75:19", "i mean probably i think it is yes", "75:22", "who have you talked to about this", "75:25", "and i've talked to friends friends", "75:28", "friends and", "75:29", "i'm your friend girlfriends you can tell", "75:31", "me", "75:34", "what do you got what's going on well i", "75:37", "mean the exciting thing to do would be", "75:38", "some sort of electric vertical takeover", "75:40", "landing supersonic", "75:42", "jet of some kind of vertical takeoff and", "75:44", "let it be no need for a runway just", "75:46", "shoot up", "75:46", "straight in the air and then", "75:50", "how would you do that when they do that", "75:53", "and some military aircrafts correct yes", "75:57", "the trick is that you have you have to", "75:58", "transition to level flight", "76:00", "um and then you the the the thing that", "76:03", "you'd use", "76:04", "for vertical tail for takeover landing", "76:08", "is not suitable for high-speed flight", "76:12", "so you have two different systems i", "76:14", "thought about this quite a lot", "76:16", "i've thought about the screen quite a", "76:17", "lot", "76:19", "the interesting thing about an electric", "76:21", "plane is that you want to go as high as", "76:23", "possible", "76:24", "but you need a certain energy density in", "76:25", "the battery pack um because you have to", "76:28", "overcome gravitational potential energy", "76:30", "once you've overcome gravitational", "76:31", "potential energy and you're", "76:32", "at at a high altitude the energy", "76:35", "you use in cruise is very low and then", "76:38", "you can recapture", "76:40", "a large part of your the gravitational", "76:41", "potential energy on the way down", "76:44", "so you really don't need any kind of", "76:46", "reserve fuel if you will because you", "76:48", "have the the energy of height", "76:50", "gravitational potential energy", "76:52", "this is a lot of energy so", "76:56", "so once you can get high at high you the", "76:58", "the", "76:59", "like the way to think about a plane is", "77:01", "it's a force balance", "77:02", "so the force balance so", "77:05", "a plane that is not accelerating", "77:08", "um is a neutral force balance", "77:12", "yeah the force of gravity you have the", "77:13", "lift force of the wings", "77:16", "then you've got the force of the", "77:18", "whatever thrusting device", "77:20", "the the propeller or turbine or whatever", "77:23", "it is", "77:24", "and you've got the resistance force of", "77:26", "the air now the higher you go", "77:29", "the lower the air resistance is air", "77:32", "density drops exponentially", "77:34", "but drag increases with the square an", "77:37", "exponential beats a square", "77:38", "the higher you go the faster you will go", "77:40", "for the same amount of energy", "77:44", "at a certain altitude you will you can", "77:46", "go supersonic", "77:48", "with less energy per mile quite a lot", "77:49", "less energy per mile", "77:51", "than an aircraft at 35 000 feet", "77:55", "because it's just a force balance", "78:00", "i'm too stupid for this conversation", "78:04", "it makes sense though no i'm sure it", "78:06", "does now", "78:07", "when you think about this new idea of of", "78:11", "of designing it i mean", "78:12", "when when you have this idea about", "78:14", "improving planes", "78:17", "are you going to bring this to somebody", "78:18", "or you just", "78:20", "chuck i have a lot on my plate right", "78:22", "that's what i'm saying", "78:24", "i don't know i don't know how you do", "78:26", "what you do now but if you keep coming", "78:28", "up with these", "78:29", "but it's got to be hard to pawn these", "78:30", "off on someone else either hey", "78:32", "go do a job good job with this vertical", "78:35", "take off and landing system that i want", "78:38", "to implement", "78:39", "to regular planes the airplane", "78:42", "electric airplane isn't necessary right", "78:44", "now electric cars", "78:46", "are important solar energy is important", "78:49", "stationary storage of energy is", "78:50", "important these things are much more", "78:52", "important than creating electric", "78:53", "supersonic fetal", "78:55", "also the planes naturally", "78:58", "you really want that gravitational", "79:00", "energy density for an aircraft", "79:02", "and this is improving over time so", "79:06", "you know it's important that we", "79:07", "accelerate the transition to sustainable", "79:09", "energy", "79:10", "that's why electric cars it matters", "79:12", "whether electric cars happen sooner or", "79:14", "later", "79:15", "you know we're really playing", "79:18", "the crazy game here with the atmosphere", "79:22",

that", "79:50", "obviously we're going to run out of oil", "79:51", "in the long term you know we're gonna", "79:54", "there's only so much oil we can", "79:56", "we can mine and burn it's total logical", "79:59", "we must have", "80:00", "such a sustainable energy transport and", "80:02", "energy infrastructure in the long term", "80:04", "so we know that's the end point we know", "80:05", "that so why run", "80:07", "this crazy experiment where we take", "80:10", "trillions of tons of carbon from", "80:12", "underground", "80:13", "and put it in the atmosphere and oceans", "80:14",

"80:26", "momentum that we started off doing this", "80:28", "when it was just a few engines a few", "80:31", "100 million gallons of fuel over the", "80:34", "whole world", "80:35", "not that big of a deal and then slowly", "80:37", "but surely over a century", "80:39", "it got out of control and now it it's", "80:42", "not just", "80:43", "our fuel but it's also", "80:46", "i mean fossil fuels are involved in so", "80:49", "many different", "80:50", "electronics so many different items that", "80:53", "people buy", "80:54", "there's just this constant desire for", "80:56", "fossil fuels constant", "80:57", "need for oil without consideration of", "81:01", "the sustainability the things like oil", "81:04", "oil coal", "81:05", "gas it's the easy money right it's easy", "81:07", "money so", "81:09", "have you heard about clean coal the", "81:11", "president's been tweeting about it's got", "81:12", "to be real", "81:13", "clean coal all caps did you see he used", "81:15", "all caps", "81:18", "clean coal um well", "81:23", "you know it's very difficult to put that", "81:25", "co2 back in the ground", "81:26", "it doesn't like being in solid form it", "81:28", "takes a lot of energy like that like", "81:30", "some sort of a filter", "81:31", "giant building sized filter sucks carbon", "81:34", "out of the atmosphere", "81:37", "no no it doesn't it's not possible no no", "81:39", "no no definitely in fucked", "81:42", "no we're not fucked", "81:48", "i mean this is quite a complex question", "81:50", "right", "81:53", "you know we're really just when we're", "81:55", "the more", "81:56", "carbon we take out of the ground and add", "81:58", "to the atmosphere", "81:59", "and and a lot of it gets permeated into", "82:01", "the oceans", "82:02", "the more dangerous it is like i i don't", "82:05", "think right", "82:06", "now i think we're okay right now we can", "82:09", "probably even add some more", "82:11", "but the momentum towards sustainable", "82:14", "energy is", "82:15", "too slow like the", "82:18", "there's a vast base of industry", "82:21", "vast transportation system like this", "82:24", "there's two and a half billion cars and", "82:25",

"82:35", "year", "82:36", "so it would take if you could snap your", "82:39", "fingers", "82:40", "and instantly turn all", "82:43", "old cars and trucks electric it would", "82:45", "still take 25 years", "82:47", "to change the transport base to electric", "82:52", "makes sense because how long does a", "82:53", "truck car truck last before it", "82:55", "goes into the junkyard and gets crushed", "82:57", "about 20 to 25 years", "82:59", "is there a way to accelerate that", "83:01", "process like some sort of subsidies or", "83:04", "some encouragement from the government", "83:06", "financially", "83:08", "well the thing that is going on right", "83:10", "now is that there's a", "83:12", "an inherent subsidy in any oil burning", "83:15", "device any any power plant or car", "83:19", "is fundamentally uh consuming", "83:22", "the carbon capacity of the oceans and", "83:25", "atmosphere", "83:27", "or just say atmosphere for short so like", "83:30", "you can say", "83:30", "okay there's a certain probability of", "83:34", "something", "83:35", "bad happening past a certain carbon", "83:38", "concentration in the atmosphere", "83:40", "and so there's some uncertain

really quite the scientific", "84:07", "scientific consensus", "84:08", "is overwhelming um", "84:13", "overwhelming i mean i don't know any", "84:16", "serious scientists actually zero", "84:17", "literally zero who who don't think", "84:20", "that you know that that", "84:24", "we were have quite a serious climate", "84:26", "risk that we're facing", "84:28", "and so there's fundamentally a subsidy", "84:32", "occurring", "84:33", "with every fossil fuel burning thing", "84:37", "power plants aircraft", "84:42", "car frankly even rockets i mean rockets", "84:44", "use up", "84:45", "you know they burn they burn fuel but", "84:48", "there's just", "84:48", "you know with rockets there's just no", "84:49", "other way to to get to", "84:51", "orbit unfortunately so it's the only way", "84:55", "but with cars there's definitely a", "84:57", "better way with electric cars", "85:00", "and to generate the energy do so with", "85:02", "photovoltaics because we've got a giant", "85:04", "thermonuclear reactor in the sky called", "85:06", "the sun", "85:08", "it's great it shows up every day very", "85:10", "reliable", "85:12", "so if you can generate energy from solar", "85:14", "panels stored with batteries", "85:16", "you can have energy 24 hours a day", "85:19", "um and then you can", "85:23", "you know concentrate to the poles or", "85:25", "near", "85:26", "to the north uh with uh you know high", "85:29", "voltage lines", "85:30", "also the north northern part parts of", "85:32", "the world tend to have", "85:34", "a lot of hydropower as well", "85:37", "but anyway all fossil fuel powered", "85:40", "things", "85:40", "have an inherent subsidy which is their", "85:42", "consumption of the carbon capacity of", "85:44", "the atmosphere", "85:46", "and oceans so", "85:50", "people tend to think like why why should", "85:52", "electric vehicles have a subsidy", "85:54", "but they're not taking into account that", "85:56", "all", "85:58", "fossil fuel burning vehicles", "86:00", "fundamentally", "86:01", "are subsidized by the cost the", "86:04", "environmental cost", "86:05", "to earth", "86:08", "but nobody's paying for it we are going", "86:10", "to pay for it obviously", "86:11", "in the future we will pay for it it's", "86:14", "just not paid for now", "86:16", "now what is the bottleneck in regards to", "86:19", "electric cars and", "86:20", "trucks and things like that is it", "86:22", "battery capacity", "86:25", "yeah i've got to scale up production got", "86:28", "to make the car compelling", "86:30", "make it better than gasoline or diesel", "86:33", "cars", "86:34", "make it more efficient in terms of like", "86:35", "the distance it can travel yeah you're", "86:37", "going to be able to go far", "86:38", "far enough recharge fast and your", "86:40", "roadster", "86:41", "you're you're anticipating 600 miles is", "86:43", "that correct", "86:46", "yeah yeah what is it 600 miles is that", "86:49", "right now like have you driven one 600", "86:51", "miles now", "86:52", "no we could totally make one right now", "86:53", "that would do 600 miles but the thing is", "86:55", "too expensive", "86:56", "so it's like the car much more so", "87:00", "well you know just have a 200 kilowatt", "87:02", "hour battery pack and you can go 600", "87:04", "miles", "87:06", "what do you have now 330", "87:10", "mile range so that's really 30 miles", "87:12", "what is that in terms of kilowatts", "87:15", "well that would be for a model s", "87:18", "100 kilowatt hour pack will do about 330", "87:21", "miles maybe 335", "87:23", "but some people have hypermiled it to", "87:24", "500 miles", "87:26", "hyper mild it would yeah i just like go", "87:28", "on 45 miles an hour or something yeah", "87:31", "they're like 30 miles an hour or", "87:32", "something", "87:32", "it's like on level ground with you pump", "87:35", "the tires up", "87:36", "really well and go on a smooth surface", "87:38", "and and you can go for a long time", "87:40", "um but do you like definitely", "87:42", "comfortably do 300 miles", "87:44", "is fine for most people uh", "87:47", "usually 200 or 250 miles is fine 300", "87:50", "miles is", "87:52", "you don't even think about it really is", "87:53", "there any possibility that you could use", "87:55", "solar power that", "87:56", "solar powered one day especially in los", "87:58",

you'll be", "88:05", "able to just power all these cars", "88:08", "just on solar power i mean we don't ever", "88:10", "have cloudy days", "88:11", "if we do there's three of them", "88:14", "well the surface area of a car is", "88:19", "without making the car like really", "88:20", "blocky um or having some like a g", "88:23", "wagon yeah like and just like having", "88:26", "like a lot of surfs area where like", "88:27", "maybe like solar panels fold out or", "88:29", "something", "88:29", "like your e-class that's what we needed", "88:32", "uh", "88:32", "the e-type yeah that the

politician", "96:00", "no he's elected judge this is a very", "96:01", "famous story", "96:03", "who he's in jail right now i think for", "96:05", "the rest of his life", "96:06", "and he put away he he would take like a", "96:09", "young boy would do something like steal", "96:10", "something from a store", "96:12", "and he would put him in detention for", "96:14", "you know five years something", "96:16", "ridiculously egregious and they", "96:19", "investigated his history and they found", "96:21", "out that he was literally being paid off", "96:23", "um was it by private prisons", "96:25", "is that what the the deal was there was", "96:28", "some sort of uh", "96:29", "but anyway this judges two judges two", "96:31", "judges kids for cash scandal is what", "96:33",

where they're", "96:46", "in jail now that someone was paying them", "96:49", "to uh put more asses in the seats in", "96:52", "these", "96:53", "private prisons a million dollar payment", "96:55",

"want to assure you this is not the case", "97:18", "the vast majority of judges are very", "97:20", "good i agree and", "97:21", "they care about justice and they could", "97:23", "have made a lot more money if they", "97:24", "wanted to be a trial lawyer", "97:26", "and instead they cared about justice and", "97:27", "they made less money because they care", "97:29", "about justice and that's why they're", "97:30", "judges", "97:31", "i feel that same way about police", "97:32", "officers i feel like there's so many", "97:34", "interactions with so many different", "97:36", "people with police officers", "97:37", "that the very few that stand out that", "97:40", "are horrific", "97:41", "we we tend to look at that like this is", "97:43", "evidence that police are all corrupt and", "97:45", "i think that's crazy", "97:47", "no most most police are are are very", "97:49", "honest yes um", "97:50", "and uh and and and and like", "97:54", "the military evidence military personnel", "97:55", "that i know are very honorable ethical", "97:58", "people", "97:58", "yes and much more ethical than the", "98:00", "average person that's my impression", "98:02", "that's my impression as well but and", "98:04", "that's not to suggest that we", "98:05", "be complacent and assume everyone's", "98:07", "honest and ethical", "98:08", "and obviously if somebody is is given a", "98:11", "a", "98:11", "trusted place in society such as being a", "98:14", "police officer or a judge and they are", "98:16", "corrupt then we must be extra vigilant", "98:18", "against such situations", "98:19", "yes and take action uh but but we should", "98:22", "not think that this is somehow broadly", "98:24", "descriptive", "98:25", "of people in that profession i couldn't", "98:27", "agree more i think there's also an issue", "98:29", "with um one of the things that happens", "98:31", "with police officers prosecutors and", "98:34", "and anyone that's trying to convict", "98:36", "someone or arrest someone", "98:37", "is that it becomes a game and in games", "98:39", "people want to win", "98:41", "and sometimes people cheat yes", "98:44", "yes i mean if you know if you're a", "98:47", "prosecutor", "98:48", "you should not always want to win there", "98:50", "are times when you should like okay", "98:51", "i just should not want to win this case", "98:54", "um and then", "98:54", "you know like just pass on that case", "98:57", "sometimes people want to win too much", "98:58", "that is true", "98:59", "um i think also the it becomes tough if", "99:03", "you're", "99:04", "if you're like a district attorney you", "99:07", "know", "99:07", "you you tend to sort of see a lot of", "99:09", "criminals and then", "99:11", "your your view of the world can get", "99:13", "negatively yes you know", "99:14", "have a negative you know", "99:18", "you have a negative view of the world", "99:19", "because you know you're just interacting", "99:21", "with a lot of criminals", "99:22", "but actually most of society is not", "99:24", "consistent criminals right", "99:26", "um and i actually had this conversation", "99:27", "at dinner several years ago with", "99:29", "district attorney i was like man it must", "99:31", "sometimes seem pretty", "99:33", "pretty dark because you know", "99:36", "man there's some some terrible human", "99:38", "beings out there", "99:40", "and he was like yep and he was like", "99:42", "dealing with some case", "99:43", "which consisted of a couple of old", "99:46", "ladies that would", "99:48", "run people over somehow for insurance", "99:50", "money it was rough", "99:53", "i was like wow that's that's that's", "99:54", "pretty rough", "99:56", "it's like it's like hard to maintain", "99:58", "faith in humanity if you're a district", "100:00", "attorney but", "100:01", "but you know it's only a few percent of", "100:04", "society that are", "100:05", "actually bad and then if you go to the", "100:08", "worst", "100:08", "say point one percent of society or the", "100:12", "worst one in a thousand one in a million", "100:15", "you know like how bad is the millionth", "100:17", "worst person in the united states", "100:19", "pretty damn bad like damn evil like", "100:22", "the the millionth like the", "100:26", "millionth well one in a million of evil", "100:28", "is", "100:29", "so evil people cannot even conceive of", "100:32", "it", "100:33", "but there's 330 million people in the", "100:35", "united states so that's 330 people", "100:37", "out there somewhere but by the same", "100:41", "token there's also", "100:42", "330 people who are incredible angels and", "100:45", "unbelievably good human beings yeah", "100:49", "on the other side but because of our", "100:50", "fear of danger", "100:52", "we tend to our thoughts tend to", "100:55", "gravitate towards the worst case", "100:56", "scenario", "100:57", "yes and we want to frame that and it's", "100:59", "one of the real problems with prejudice", "101:01", "we want whether it's prejudice towards", "101:04", "different minorities or prejudice", "101:05", "towards police officers or anything", "101:08", "it's like we want to look at the worst", "101:09", "case scenario and say this is an example", "101:11", "of what this is all about", "101:13", "and you see that even with people how", "101:15", "they frame genders", "101:17", "some some men frame women like that they", "101:19", "get ripped off by a few women and they", "101:20", "decide all women are evil", "101:22", "some women get fucked over by a few men", "101:23", "all men are shit and", "101:25", "and this this is very toxic and it's", "101:28", "also", "101:29", "it's a very unbalanced way of viewing", "101:32", "the world", "101:33", "and it's very emotionally based and it's", "101:35", "based on your own experience your own", "101:36", "anecdotal experience", "101:38", "and it can it can be very influential to", "101:41", "the people around you", "101:42", "and it's just it's a dangerous way it's", "101:45", "a dangerous thought", "101:46", "process and pattern to promote it is it", "101:48", "is a very dangerous", "101:49", "pattern i really think you know people", "101:53", "should give other people the benefit of", "101:54", "the doubt", "101:55", "and assume that they're good until", "101:57", "proven otherwise", "101:58", "and i think really most people are", "102:00", "actually pretty good people", "102:03", "nobody's perfect they have to be if you", "102:05", "think of the vast numbers of", "102:07", "us that are just interacting with each", "102:08", "other with each other constantly", "102:10", "yeah we have to be better than we think", "102:12", "we are yeah there's no way like

about the future of your", "104:59", "companies", "105:00", "what do you see as like bottlenecks you", "105:02", "want some more of those uh sure", "105:04", "thank you what do you see in terms of", "105:07", "like", "105:07", "bottlenecks of things that are that are", "105:09", "holding back innovation", "105:11", "is it regulatory commissions and and", "105:14", "people that don't understand the", "105:15", "technology that are", "105:17", "influencing policy like what what what", "105:20", "could potentially be holding", "105:22", "you guys back right now", "105:27", "is there anything that you would change", "105:28", "yeah that's a good question", "105:34", "you know i wish i wish politicians were", "105:37", "better at science", "105:38", "that would help a lot that's a problem", "105:42", "yes there's no incentive for them to be", "105:44", "good at science", "105:45", "there isn't um actually you know they're", "105:48", "pretty good at science in china", "105:50", "i have to say yeah the", "105:53", "mayor of beijing is i believe in", "105:54", "environmental engineering degree", "105:56", "and the deputy mayor as a physics degree", "105:58", "i met them", "105:59",

"they think it's horseshit", "106:23", "oh i like phones i don't know i don't", "106:25", "know", "106:26", "um like the government say don't you buy", "106:28", "huawei phones", "106:30", "does that do are you up on that at all", "106:32", "no should we just abandon this idea", "106:34", "well i think like i guess if you're if", "106:37", "you're uh", "106:38", "if you have like top secret stuff um", "106:41", "then you want to be pretty careful about", "106:43", "what hardware you use", "106:44", "uh but you know like most people do not", "106:46", "have top secret stuff", "106:48", "right and like nobody really cares what", "106:49", "porn you watch you know right", "106:51", "like it's like nobody actually cares", "106:55", "you know so and if they do that's kind", "106:58", "of on them", "107:00", "like national spy agencies do not care", "107:02", "do not", "107:04", "give a rat's ass what porn you watch", "107:07", "they do not", "107:08", "care so like what secrets",

to stop them from", "107:29", "integrating into our culture", "107:30", "and letting this like right now they're", "107:32", "the number two", "107:33", "cell phone manufacturer in the world",

somehow another controlled by the", "108:01", "chinese government", "108:02", "the communist chinese government is", "108:04", "going to distribute these phones", "108:06", "and i don't know if it's

not really you know i don't", "108:16", "think we should worry too much about", "108:17", "huawei phones", "108:18", "uh you know maybe you know our national", "108:21", "security agencies shouldn't have", "108:23", "huawei phones maybe that's a question", "108:25", "mark uh", "108:27", "but uh i think for the average citizen", "108:29", "it doesn't matter", "108:31", "doesn't doesn't like no they're not i'm", "108:33", "pretty sure", "108:34", "the chinese government does not care", "108:35", "about the goings-on of", "108:38", "the average american citizen is there", "108:41", "is there

people want privacy because they seem", "109:11", "to put everything on the internet", "109:13", "well right now they're confused but when", "109:15", "you're talking about your neural link",

i think people", "110:37", "there's like not that much", "110:40", "that's kept private that people that is", "110:42", "actually relevant", "110:43", "right that's people what other people",

people care about it but then", "110:52", "it gets weird when you when it gets", "110:54", "exposed like jennifer lawrence when", "110:55", "those naked pictures of her got exposed", "110:57", "like i

but", "111:36", "she's clearly doing fine", "111:38", "but once this interface is fully", "111:41", "realized", "111:42", "where we really do become something far", "111:45", "more", "111:46",

we", "113:44", "barely survived how close did you get to", "113:46", "folding", "113:49", "very close we uh", "113:52", "for 2008 is not a good time to be a car", "113:54", "company especially a startup car company", "113:56", "and", "113:56", "especially an electric car company that", "113:58", "was like stupidity squared", "114:00", "and this is when you had those cool", "114:02", "roadsters with the t-top yeah with the", "114:04", "um", "114:04", "target top yeah we had like uh", "114:08", "he was a highly modified elise chassis", "114:10", "the body was all completely different", "114:12", "by the way that was a super dumb", "114:14", "strategy that we actually did", "114:16", "was dumb it was based on two false", "114:19", "premises", "114:20", "uh one false premise was that we'd be", "114:22", "able to", "114:24", "cheaply convert the lotus elise and use", "114:27", "that", "114:27", "as a car platform", "114:31", "and that we would be able to use",

technology", "114:44", "did not work in production", "114:45", "and we ended up using none of it in the", "114:48", "long term", "114:49", "none of it we had to redesign everything", "114:51", "and then", "114:52", "the once you add a battery pack an", "114:55", "electric motor", "114:55", "to the car it got heavier got 30 heavier", "114:59", "invalidated the entire structure all the", "115:00",

including", "115:11", "cars or anything that's the seven", "115:14", "percent", "115:14", "yes everything including tires and", "115:16", "wheels bolts", "115:19", "brakes yeah even the steering wheel", "115:22", "see the steering wheel was i think the", "115:24", "steering wheel was", "115:26", "almost the same yes the", "115:29", "the windscreen when it's different no i", "115:32", "think the windscreen is the same same", "115:33", "yes i think i think we were able to keep", "115:34", "this last seven percent so that's right", "115:37", "basically every body panel is different", "115:38", "the entire structure was different", "115:40", "the uh we couldn't use the h", "115:43", "like the hvac system the you know the", "115:45", "air conditioner was a belt-driven air", "115:47", "conditioner", "115:49", "so now we needed uh something that was", "115:50", "electrically driven we need a new", "115:53", "ac compressor and all that takes away", "115:56", "from the battery life as well right", "115:57", "yeah we needed a small highly efficient", "116:00", "air conditioning system", "116:02", "um that fit in a tiny car and was", "116:04", "electrically powered

"116:14", "that's still very sound depending on", "116:15", "which version twenty six fifty to twenty", "116:17", "seven fifty pounds something like that", "116:19", "and what was the weight distribution", "116:22", "um it was about fifty", "116:25", "well there were different versions of", "116:27", "the car um so it was about", "116:29", "55 on the rear because it was rear", "116:32", "biased right but", "116:33", "not bad like considering like a 911", "116:36", "which is like one of the most popular", "116:37", "sports cars of all time", "116:38", "heavy rear end bias well i mean", "116:43", "yeah the 911 i think the joke is like", "116:46", "they managed to", "116:48", "despite newton not being on their side", "116:50", "yeah if you're fighting newton it's very", "116:52", "difficult", "116:53", "well it's like you've got those the", "116:55", "moments of inertia on a 911", "116:57", "don't make any sense they do once you", "116:59", "understand them", "117:01", "once you understand you don't want to", "117:02", "hang the engine off the ass this is not", "117:04", "a wise move", "117:05", "you don't want to let up on the gas when", "117:07", "you're in a corner", "117:09", "the problem with whether with with", "117:12", "something that's", "117:12", "where the engine is mounted over the", "117:14", "rear axle or off the rear axle towards",

screwed right like essentially if", "117:28", "you spawn the car like a top", "117:30", "that's your problem moment of inertia", "117:33", "you're just", "117:35", "i promised i wouldn't swear on this show", "117:37", "by the way really to who", "117:38", "because it was my friend tell that", "117:40", "friend to go fuck himself who told you", "117:42", "not to swear", "117:43", "afraid i'm not a good friend yes", "117:46", "definitely", "117:47", "realize you're fucking elon musk you can", "117:49", "do whatever you want man", "117:51", "if you ever get confused call me i'll", "117:54", "swear in private", "117:55", "swear up a storm just say fricken it's a", "117:58", "fun way there's like", "117:59", "old house moms", "118:01", "[Laughter]", "118:04", "wives and shit that have children oh", "118:07", "this freaking thing", "118:08", "yeah but anyway like like the porsche is", "118:10", "kind of incredible how well porsche", "118:11", "handle is given", "118:12", "that uh it's the physics yes the moments", "118:15", "of inertia are", "118:16", "so messed up uh to actually still make", "118:19", "it work", "118:20", "well is is incredible well if you know", "118:21", "how to turn into the corner once you get", "118:23", "used to the feeling of it there's actual", "118:25", "benefits to it", "118:26", "you know there are some benefits i enjoy", "118:29", "i the car i had before", "118:31", "tesla was a 911. oh okay that was 997", "118:35", "or six yeah 997 yeah yeah", "118:39", "um great car man yeah i mean", "118:41", "particularly with on the porsche", "118:43", "when they had the variable vanes uh the", "118:45", "turbo and you didn't have the turbo lag", "118:46", "that was great", "118:47", "yeah that was really great the turbo lag", "118:49", "was is like", "118:50", "you know if you floor it like phone home", "118:53", "call your mom the older one about an", "118:56", "hour later the car accelerates", "118:58", "and super dangerous too because then the", "119:00", "real wheels start spinning", "119:02", "yeah yeah there's something fun about it", "119:04", "though like feeling that", "119:05", "rear weight kicking around you know and", "119:08", "again", "119:08", "it's quite efficient a good feel to it", "119:10", "yeah yeah i agree but that's that's what", "119:12", "i was talking about earlier about that", "119:14", "little car that i have the", "119:15", "93 911 it's just there's it's not fast", "119:19", "it's not it's not the best handling car", "119:21", "but it's more satisfying than any other", "119:23", "car i have", "119:24", "because it's so mechanical it's like", "119:26", "everything about it like", "119:27", "crackles and bumps and it gives you all", "119:30", "this feedback and", "119:31", "i take it to the comedy store because", "119:33", "when i get there i feel like my brain is", "119:35", "just popping and it's on fire", "119:37", "it's like a strategy for me now that i i", "119:40", "really stopped driving other cars there", "119:42", "i drive that car there just for the", "119:44", "brain juice", "119:46", "just for the the the inner the", "119:48", "interaction", "119:50", "i mean you should try model s p 100 d", "119:52", "i'll try to blow your mind", "119:54", "your skull okay yeah tell me what to", "119:57", "order i'll order it", "119:58", "model sp 100d okay jamie that's the best", "120:01", "car that i drive", "120:02", "okay okay i'll get with the car you", "120:04", "drive okay", "120:05", "it will blow your mind out of your scope", "120:07", "i believe you how far can i drive", "120:09", "how far about 300 miles that's good for", "120:12", "la", "120:13", "regular days you will never notice the", "120:15", "battery never", "120:16", "never how hard is it to get like one of", "120:18", "them crazy plugs", "120:20", "installed in your house that difficult", "120:22", "no it's super easy it's like", "120:24", "yeah it's like a dryer plug it's like a", "120:26",

it's", "121:52", "really hard because you have to have", "121:54", "sunlight go through", "121:55", "right but where to cut when this when it", "121:56", "gets reflected back out", "121:58", "it
