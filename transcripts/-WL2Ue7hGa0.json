lean forward more you strike down", "42:02", "and you almost hit with your foot flat", "42:05", "but what you never want to do is run", "42:07", "like that asshole heel down that's how", "42:09", "people destroy their knees running and", "42:11", "that was all created by Nike Nike", "42:12", "created that a stupid bubble fat heel", "42:15", "shoe because you know to give you more", "42:17", "cushioning but it's just the mechanics", "42:19", "of it are totally wrong if you ever", "42:21", "watched little kids run their run ball", "42:22", "the foot first that's natural that's how", "42:24", "you're supposed to naturally run it's", "42:26", "your foot is literally designed as a", "42:27", "shock absorber I run with those", "42:29", "minimalist shoes my shoes have zero", "42:32", "cushioning zero so I'm running mountains", "42:35", "and hills and shit like that even I'm", "42:36", "when I hunted elk last week", "42:38", "see these guys oh yeah right on the ball", "42:41", "mm-hmm but the black ones the real dark", "42:43", "black ones were good they run barefoot", "42:45", "those fucking guys but these guys are", "42:47", "they're landing flats they have a lot of", "42:50", "cushioning on these shoes you have to", "42:51", "realize like it and some of these guys", "42:52", "are landing heel that kind the bad guys", "42:54", "down heel first and that's because of", "42:56", "those goddamn shoes if you didn't have", "42:58", "shoes like that there's no fucking way", "43:00", "that guy's all he'll see that last guy", "43:03", "that guy's all heel you would never run", "43:05", "like that it's against the mechanics of", "43:07", "the human knee hold it go back to that", "43:09", "what does that video that just come up", "43:11", "it's the elite what was that video that", "43:13", "was just coming up next said Candice", "43:16", "running cadence Oh", "43:18", "cadence okay that that video like that's", "43:23", "the only reason that people are running", "43:25", "like that is because the invention of", "43:27", "those shoes I mean you you run quite a", "43:29", "bit right I've I've seen the reason I", "43:31", "looked for that is because I've seen a", "43:32", "video from the Olympics I think it was", "43:33", "last year where they're showing long", "43:34", "distance runners and all of them had a", "43:36", "different stride some were running ball", "43:38", "foot or first some were running heel", "43:41", "first the winner it was different I mean", "43:44", "it's also goes to all their bodies are", "43:45", "different they have different well you", "43:46", "can run heel first with those shoes and", "43:48", "you can get away with it for a long time", "43:50", "the the issue is that's not the way your", "43:52", "body's designed and the only reason why", "43:54", "people are running like that because", "43:55", "those fucking shoes you know if you talk", "43:58", "to physiologists and people study", "44:00", "anatomy and the", "44:02", "loads and the human need there's massive", "44:04", "loads there's massive problems with", "44:08", "running he'll first just not unit you're", "44:10", "not designed like that I would say", "44:12", "though just isn't disclaimer the biggest", "44:13", "problem for most people who are probably", "44:15", "those do it is you don't run it at all", "44:16", "so go ahead and get up fucking ass and", "44:19", "run and then figure out the exact right", "44:20", "technique later", "44:21", "remember when we trying to convince Burt", "44:22", "that running on a treadmill is not the", "44:24", "same as running and he was like no way", "44:25", "and they try real running here's a", "44:27", "quarter dude it is so much harder of", "44:29", "course the fucking treadmills coming", "44:31", "towards you all you have to just pick", "44:32", "your legs up but you know it's way light", "44:34", "for me anyway that I've noticed running", "44:36", "on actual ground where's that burst", "44:38", "pavement ground is way easier always on", "44:41", "my joints if I can go longer it gets a", "44:43", "give or something it's like putting a", "44:44", "cork but you're you can run on pavement", "44:47", "no problem as long as you run uphill", "44:49", "really well it's not just that it's you", "44:53", "just not pounding when you're running", "44:55", "uphill because you're decelerating as", "44:57", "you catch yourself and you're pushing", "44:59", "off it's like you're doing lunges the", "45:01", "problems with that is unless you're", "45:02", "running in a dolly", "45:03", "then it's fucking impossible to keep", "45:06", "running uphill it's good point good", "45:07", "reference to leave references you having", "45:12", "this every podcast I walk downhill", "45:16", "basically Walter wait and then run", "45:18", "uphill oh really", "45:19", "why kind of I mean I go way slower", "45:22", "downhill it's just dangerous it's bad", "45:24", "for your joint yeah pound like going", "45:26", "downhill like deceleration like running", "45:29", "downhill and catching yourself like that", "45:31", "it's just not good but the deceleration", "45:33", "when you it's not even deceleration", "45:35", "really but when you run uphill", "45:37", "there's no pounding yeah because you're", "45:40", "just reaching that area and then pushing", "45:42", "but it wears you out more but like your", "45:44", "muscles but you're right the joints okay", "45:46", "we were hiking the Alps this year and", "45:47", "July and man there's up hills with like", "45:51", "you really have to push but down hills", "45:52", "like you're pushing off yeah and it's", "45:54", "like it just hurts more yeah it beats up", "45:57", "your knees to really beats up your knees", "45:59", "yeah I found that elk hunting too but", "46:01", "the really the painful stuff was the", "46:03", "downhill you're just stopping yourself", "46:05", "stopping yourself stopping yourself and", "46:07", "yeah there's also a lot of sliding yeah", "46:09", "and they almost like got a pusher foot", "46:11", "sideways like so down that way it's", "46:13", "almost easier yeah that's why they have", "46:14", "such stiff", "46:15", "use when those stiffs are you don't rush", "46:17", "shoes you don't come over the edge get", "46:19", "an edge and you dig that edge into the", "46:21", "ground I got some good luck boots for", "46:22", "that and it was really good makes a big", "46:25", "difference", "46:25", "I tried hiking with these minimalist", "46:27", "shoes this last trip that I was on I", "46:29", "didn't like him I wasn't a fan they're", "46:32", "fine for running if I'm running on a", "46:33", "trail but for hiking like the human body", "46:36", "is just we have
