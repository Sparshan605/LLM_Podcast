"well the difference is lomachenko had an", "30:58", "extensive amateur yeah internationally", "31:01", "but so did Crawford Crawford had a great", "31:03", "amateur background to look", "31:04", "Crawford the the difference is", "31:06", "Crawford's way bigger that's the", "31:07", "difference if they were the same size it", "31:08", "would be really interesting to see what", "31:10", "would happen", "31:10", "but Crawford's a lot bigger than him he", "31:13", "would yeah I mean it's not a good fine", "31:14", "now it's just to watch him take riggan", "31:16", "now and all these amazing

holes", "32:08", "are okay I see how key to the castle", "32:10", "let's rock right and then somewhere", "32:12", "around the end of the first round", "32:14", "Anderson would start switching
