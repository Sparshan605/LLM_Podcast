little bit of it it's", "08:54", "supposed to be a little bit of an insult", "08:56", "so alternative archaeology", "08:59", "so it's good to remember that so you", "09:01", "have these guys on the podcast for three", "09:03", "or four hours and the audience listening", "09:05", "thinks yeah why don't these guys get a", "09:07", "fair hearing I mean it's like there's", "09:08", "the mainstream and then there's these", "09:10", "guys right but but there isn't just", "09:11", "these guys there's hundreds of", "09:13", "alternative archaeological theories so", "09:16", "which one gets the play

"11:23", "the mainstream through peer-reviewed", "11:24", "journals and then you go to conferences", "11:26", "and you have it out and and that's kind", "11:29", "of where we end up with well this is", "11:30", "what we think is probably true for now", "11:33", "and then all these other people out here", "11:36", "if they don't jump in and into the pool", "11:38", "where everybody is then

the tendency to find", "11:58", "meaningful patterns and random noise you", "12:00", "know the Virgin Mary on a grilled cheese", "12:01", "sandwich or whatever those are fun", "12:03", "examples but

yeah it's easy in the", "12:17", "mind's eye to find a pattern the", "12:19", "question is did those people really", "12:21", "think 10,000 years ago 5,000 years so", "12:23", "this is a field called

sometimes", "12:34", "they're totally random and or you take", "12:38", "something like the pyramids you know as", "12:39", "as Graham knows there's you know a", "12:41", "hundred theories about the pyramids and", "12:43", "there's the mainstream one and then", "12:45", "there's all these other ones and this is", "12:46", "why people like the director they're you", "12:50", "know house he just can't deal with them", "12:51", "all you know so just as one example I", "12:53", "used in my book why people leave were", "12:55", "things that you know one guy calculated", "12:57", "that if you divide the height of the", "12:59", "pyramid into twice the side of the base", "13:01", "you get the number close to pi and then", "13:03", "he just sort of works all these", "13:04", "different numbers so therefore it's", "13:06", "cosmically significant well Richard", "13:08", "Hoagland was like the best example right", "13:09", "I would find these patterns and Mars and", "13:12", "I can claim that like if you go from", "13:15", "this rock to half the distance and like", "13:17", "why would", "13:18", "do that like that doesn't make any sense", "13:19", "he would create these patterns right and", "13:22", "that's okay I mean all scientists look", "13:24", "for patterns so like to take climate", "13:27", "change either the earth was getting", "13:29", "warmer it's not either it's human-caused", "13:31", "or it's not there's a pattern in the", "13:32", "data you can see the pattern the", "13:34", "question is is the pattern real so this", "13:36", "is why there we call it we use the term", "13:38", "climate consensus it's not a democracy", "13:41", "it's not like we voted on it decided", "13:43", "this is the truth it's that", "13:45", "independently all these different",

"14:02", "data they're independently coming to", "14:04", "these conclusions so that lifts our", "14:06", "confidence that yeah there's probably", "14:08", "something to their theory such that", "14:10", "there's now so much data converging to", "14:12", "this you'd have to deconstruct every one", "14:13", "of those independent lines so then you", "14:17", "have things like what I call the problem", "14:20", "of the residue of anomalies in any field", "14:22", "there are residue of anomalies we can't", "14:25", "explain so like UFOs for example you", "14:28", "apologists and media skeptic agree that", "14:31", "90 to 95 percent of all the UFO", "14:33", "sightings are explained by natural", "14:34", "phenomenon venus swamp gas airplanes", "14:37", "geese whatever they know that and so", "14:40", "we're really only talking about 5% like", "14:42", "how do you explain that one right there", "14:45", "in 1967 on June 3rd it yeah I don't know", "14:48", "no one knows that one and then from", "14:51", "there they billed well that's my case", "14:52", "right if you can't explain that then I I", "14:55", "have a cake no no no well that's very", "14:57", "different than what we're talking about", "15:01", "totally relevant because I think almost", "15:04", "all of your argument is based on this", "15:07", "residue of anomalies what we call a God", "15:10", "of the gaps argument if you scientists", "15:12", "can't explain you know this particular", "15:13", "Rock right here or that particular", "15:15", "petroglyph and I'm going to count that", "15:17", "toward my compilation of data to support", "15:20", "my hypothesis of a lost civilization no", "15:23", "one is saying that the scientists can't", "15:25", "explain it what would essentially", "15:27",

caps and Randall", "15:40", "stepping off you are just okay we go", "15:42", "ahead if you want what they do say I", "15:44", "mean depends do you mean by rapid you", "15:46", "know I mean a glacial dam that as our", "15:48", "geologist will tell us a moment that", "15:50", "that breaks that's fairly rapid mm-hmm", "15:52", "back in 96 it was a very popular book", "15:54", "called the Noah's Flood this was a", "15:56", "serious book by two geologists that said", "15:58", "it was the rapid filling up of the Black", "16:02", "Sea that swamped over the civilizations", "16:05", "living on the edges of this and that", "16:07", "that's where the noachian flood story", "16:10", "comes from okay so it was widely debated", "16:12", "and so on and since it hasn't fared that", "16:14", "well but that's fairly rapid I mean", "16:16", "we're talking over the course of weeks", "16:17", "or months or years to a geologist you", "16:20", "know thousands of years is rapid mm-hmm", "16:22", "so you know an impact by a comment", "16:25", "happens in a couple hours or a couple of", "16:27", "days or weeks versus a couple of months", "16:29", "or years what do we mean by rapid okay", "16:32", "well what are you saying then okay so", "16:35", "what are you saying about their theories", "16:36", "in particular okay so the problem I", "16:40", "think Graham that the deepest problem is", "16:42", "is much of your theory depends on", "16:44", "negative evidence that is I don't accept", "16:48", "the mainstream explanation for the", "16:50", "pyramids the Sphinx the Machu Picchu", "16:52", "whatever ELISA I talk about that let's", "16:54", "just talk about this specific subject", "16:55", "because it's going to take a long time", "16:56", "just together all right yeah all right", "16:59", "so my final point is is the", "17:02", "falsifiability one that is what would it", "17:05", "take to refute your hypothesis like for", "17:08", "me the answer would be like if gobekli", "17:10", "tepe turned out to be what you think it", "17:12", "might have been the place where advanced", "17:15", "ancient civilization once inhabited or", "17:18", "they used it where are the metal

part of the risk is that you're", "93:59", "gonna find something I don't happen to", "94:00", "know about and then it's like you see I", "94:02", "made my point what point that okay so in", "94:05", "in like the history of the people in of", "94:08", "America that that area there's always", "94:10", "somebody that comes in with it's you", "94:12", "know not Clovis it's this is that and", "94:14",

into North America and we", "94:33", "just don't have all the sites but when", "94:35", "somebody comes up with a site like", "94:36", "that's tens of thousands of years", "94:38", "earlier than all the others that are", "94:40", "accepted here and it's over here", "94:42", "where are all the sites in between where", "94:44", "is it it's like the gap the 5000-year", "94:45", "gap with the Egyptian complex where are", "94:48", "the sites if it's true we they didn't", "94:50", "fly there so how do they get there well", "94:53", "and there must be a trail you know", "94:54", "somewhere that we could find unless they", "94:56", "came by boat and then that's evidences", "94:58", "well unless you're dealing with twenty", "95:00", "four thousand years ago and there's not", "95:01", "much evidence to find that Navy but if", "95:04", "they came by boat then that clearly", "95:05", "implies they had navigational skills", "95:07", "they had the ability to build boats and", "95:10",

"ocean-going but hypothesis tenure that", "95:23", "that's proposed is that they came across", "95:25", "by by boat just following the shore you", "95:28", "the same area as the Bering Strait yeah", "95:30", "you're just a hundred feet offshore", "95:31", "right go in and most likely both right", "95:35", "and one of the issues of course was the", "95:37", "short-faced bear was so formidable", "95:39", "according to Dan Flores that it would", "95:41", "have been a huge impediment for people", "95:42", "crossing on foot anyway and the", "95:45", "short-faced bear went extinct right", "95:47", "around the time we see more evidence of", "95:49", "human beings entering in but why did it", "95:52", "go extinct that's the big question well", "95:53", "you have to add that to the list of", "95:54", "predators that there would have been no", "95:56", "reason for humans to have been hunting", "95:58", "yeah well it's an enormous enormous", "96:00", "animal so there's sort of two two", "96:01", "factors that go on here there's positive", "96:03", "evidence in favor of a hypothesis then", "96:05", "there's negative evidence against the", "96:07", "mainstream hypothesis and you really", "96:09", "need both so it's not enough to just say", "96:12", "I don't accept the evidence for here", "96:14", "that okay that's fine scientists do that", "96:16", "all the time", "96:17", "what evidence what do you let's be let's", "96:18", "be speaking specifics because you keep", "96:20", "doing this you keep saying well they", "96:21", "find things and it turns out no that's", "96:23", "not true and then you're essentially", "96:24", "like proving your point of being a", "96:25", "skeptic without having any real cases", "96:27", "well just keep saying those the case is", "96:30", "it but but you know you're not saying", "96:31", "you can't say all the cases if you don't", "96:33", "want to cite anything specifically don't", "96:35", "keep bringing up things that are refuted", "96:37", "because you don't have anything that", "96:38", "you're pointing to", "96:38", "so you're just muddying the water okay", "96:41", "you're essentially pissing in the pool", "96:42",

example so let's watch what", "97:09", "happens to the hundred and thirty", "97:10", "thousand year old hypothesis if it if it", "97:12", "holds up and there's other sites that", "97:14", "are dated

want to", "196:37", "see some pictures of the scablands", "196:39", "because that is pretty amazing stuff and", "196:40", "Randall one more thing before we go one", "196:43", "thing that you pointed out to me during", "196:45", "one of the episodes that was so stunning", "196:47", "was these woolly mammoths that had been", "196:50", "literally knocked over by an impact with", "196:53", "broken

flooding this entire scene was", "198:09", "submerged below water and the cataract", "198:11", "here is an extinct feature and the flow", "198:14", "over here was thousands of times greater",

oh yeah we are talking about that", "198:43", "okay but yeah we got some great drone", "198:47", "footage on there did we show that last", "198:49", "time I was believe we did the light of", "198:51",

"199:18", "Wow yeah and and let's see be ready to", "199:24", "pause if we need to here", "199:27", "is this the beginning because at the", "199:29", "beginning we have a Google Earth image", "199:31", "you can get a sense of what we're", "199:32", "looking at here go back to the beginning", "199:35", "right at the very beginning let's see if", "199:37", "it starts off with their drones oh it", "199:39", "starts off with the drone okay there", "199:41", "should be another one that actually", "199:45", "that's okay this is pretty cool yeah", "199:47", "this is this is these are 400 foot", "199:50", "cliffs this was a recessional cataract", "199:52", "very similar to dry falls the water was", "199:55", "pouring coming from behind our view here", "199:59", "where is this specifically if anybody", "200:00", "wanted to go watch this or look at this", "200:02", "area oh the actual area this is an", "200:05", "Eastern Washington this is this is an", "200:07", "eastern rim

Columbia River and this is just", "200:19", "north of Wenatchee Wisconsin grew up", "200:22", "Wisconsin Washington so basically what", "200:25", "we had here was a you know plucking", "200:27",

"200:37", "let's see is the is the drone comes", "200:42", "around I'm looking for the word the team", "200:46", "Oh", "200:48", "keep going to zoom in a little bit more", "200:51", "there Jamie I think we did shows you can", "200:52", "see you guys down there in the ground", "200:54", "right", "200:54", "yeah we're then there somewhere lost in", "200:56", "the vastness of the yeah now I remember", "201:00", "we did show this yeah what about those", "201:02", "images the the mastodons let's look at", "201:04", "those and then let's get out of here", "201:05", "okay for that you have to go to the", "201:08", "world of the pleistocene which I just", "201:13", "should have given you that sounds like a", "201:15", "music park yeah the world of the places", "201:18", "could be over

don't know how", "201:30", "plausible it is but that seems like a", "201:32", "terrible idea the lost world well that's", "201:38", "one of the big concerns about climate", "201:40", "change right

"bottom of a cliff right because you know", "202:35", "that they pushed a lot of them off", "202:36", "cliffs and no no this this is stuff that", "202:39", "when the the river floods it erodes the", "202:41", "banks and then this stuff falls out of", "202:43", "the river banks right so it's it's been", "202:46", "locked into the permafrost for however", "202:48", "many thousands of years and it seems", "202:50", "like there's interestingly two peaks of", "202:52", "dates that one right around 13,000 and", "202:56", "the other one around 36,000 that that", "202:59", "the that they that the fossilized", "203:02", "remains are dating to which could point", "203:04", "to a potentially that there was some", "203:05", "sort of an impact back then as well or", "203:07", "something else no I I don't know I don't", "203:10", "have an opinion on there by having all", "203:12", "these together I mean has it been", "203:14", "theorized that perhaps this was a", "203:16", "there's not a cliff near this right yeah", "203:19", "just off the to the right there's you", "203:21", "see there is a cliff we're at the bottom", "203:22", "of a cliff right here that is the", "203:24", "actually it's a river bank so so just", "203:27", "you know that that was a hunting method", "203:29", "these two stormed them off the side of", "203:31", "cliffs and they never they literally", "203:33", "couldn't even eat all of them like head", "203:34", "smashed yeah yeah they would run so many", "203:37", "I'm off cliffs yeah but but here's the", "203:39", "thing here's the thing when you look at", "203:40", "it the the more these mortality events", "203:44", "of modern animals even like looking at", "203:45", "elephants that perish during some of the", "203:47", "severe droughts in the 80s in Africa", "203:49", "taphonomic studies show that it doesn't", "203:53", "take three four or five years before", "203:55", "the the remains have completely", "203:57", "disappeared mmm", "203:59", "in

"204:18", "event covered in an event yes now what", "204:21", "there was one that I really wanted you", "204:22", "to get to that was a mastodon that had", "204:25", "been literally knocked over and had", "204:27", "broken legs yeah that would be we could", "204:32", "look very quickly at slide 92 this is", "204:37", "one of the more interesting anomalous", "204:39", "events this was the the flash-frozen", "204:43", "woolly mammoth go to the go to slide 93", "204:47", "it's a much clearer yeah this was a", "204:50", "mammoth six ton mammoth that was again", "204:53", "one of these River

"right at the centre of the screen that's", "205:40", "his back leg oh wow did you see right", "205:42", "there the interesting thing about this", "205:45", "is the you know the the rapidity of", "205:48", "climate change that's implied by being", "205:50", "able to freeze the six ton mammoth", "205:52", "because the contents of his stomach", "205:54", "according to the studies had not really", "205:56", "been putrified yet which implies that", "205:58", "the entire carcass had been frozen", "206:00", "through and through probably in less", "206:02", "than ten hours well I could see the", "206:05", "Iceman that's you know that's what", "206:07", "happened to him that's exactly what", "206:09", "happened to him yes yeah interesting", "206:10", "point and that would be a subject that", "206:12", "we should talk about what fell in", "206:14", "between a crevasse in a glacier correct", "206:16", "yeah it probably got rapidly buried", "206:19", "under the under the snow and the ice and", "206:20", "that's how he ended every night", "206:22", "preserved yeah overnight exactly the", "206:25", "next slide actually shows a", "206:26", "reconstruction of the of the in in this",

cut his", "206:52", "bone Annie had defensive wounds on his", "206:55", "hands and arms so he'd gotten in a fight", "206:56", "and he had other people's blood on his", "206:59", "hand so he gave as

around", "207:36", "the world okay I think that's is", "207:37", "entirely possible cognitively for sure", "207:40", "and you know I would do it for me but", "207:43", "you know the boats that they sent the", "207:45", "emissaries out on the wood carbon-14", "207:47", "dated and some specific examples of high", "207:51", "arts and attributes of high civilization", "207:53", "so if it's not metal and writing then", "207:57", "you know whatever it is I would change", "207:59", "my mind absolutely that's good to hear", "208:01", "Michael and I I think as the as the", "208:04", "research continues in this area for the", "208:06", "last few years having been very much an", "208:10", "outsider I have felt that the evidence", "208:13", "is moving in a direction that is helpful",

"like I say my role is a reporter and I'm", "208:27", "trying to be a reporter for the", "208:29", "alternative sides of things but to do so", "208:31", "to do so in an effective and and and", "208:33", "hopefully third there's a good argument", "208:35", "in the history of science to be made for", "208:36", "the role of outsiders I mean complete", "208:39", "Outsiders to come in and shake things up", "208:41", "I mean Freeman Dyson is an example you", "208:43", "know totally self-taught autodidact I", "208:46", "called you an autodidact absolutely and", "208:48", "they can make and if nothing else they", "208:50", "push people to really figure out what it", "208:53", "is they believe and why because", "208:55", "otherwise no one's going to challenge", "208:57", "them Harlen Bretz is a good example of", "208:58", "that you know a high school teacher", "209:00", "right", "209:01", "how about Randall Carlson well Liz you", "209:07", "still want to look at this real quick", "209:08", "mastodons I got it right here he could", "209:11", "go for days what I love about Randall he", "209:13", "never gets tired of this stuff if you", "209:16", "could bottle your enthusiasm it'd be an", "209:17", "awesome pill well maybe we can talk", "209:20", "about yeah all right we're gonna we're", "209:26", "gonna look at this this Mastodon here", "209:29", "125 125 yeah so this is a Mastodon that", "209:33", "was dug up in a pit years ago excavation", "209:37", "showed that the bones were lying on and", "209:39", "in a layer of limey clay or marl about 1", "209:41", "foot in thickness when they're meant to", "209:45", "do when it gets up there and it goes on", "209:47", "to see the skeleton proved to be badly", "209:48", "disturbed in the bones crushed and", "209:50", "broken as an example of the amount of", "209:52", "disturbance one of the ribs lay beneath", "209:54", "one of the tusks while another was", "209:57", "thrust through an aperture in the pelvis", "209:59", "a shoulder blade rested to the right of", "210:01", "the skull and one of the large neck", "210:03", "vertebrae was found about ten feet from", "210:05", "the skull near a portion of the pelvis", "210:07", "in spite of the wide dislocation of the", "210:10", "parts the now this is where it really is", "210:12", "interesting the bones of one of the feet", "210:14", "remained intact and in place very", "210:17", "possibly in the spot where the animal", "210:19", "last stepped so in other words the foot", "210:22", "there was a foot still embedded in the", "210:24", "soft material where he was apparently", "210:26", "stepping at the time whatever happened", "210:30", "to him", "210:31", "and this is all the same time period as", "210:32", "the other Macedon we don't have dating", "210:34", "on this but it likely was at the very", "210:38", "end probably writing at Younger Dryas", "210:40", "window because of the amount of sediment", "210:42", "over it go to the next slide Jaime and", "210:44", "we'll see 1:26 we can get a better so", "210:46", "this thing theoretically at least was", "210:48", "blown back yeah go to there we go there", "210:54", "you can see one of the femurs that's", "210:55", "been busted squarely across they go on", "211:00", "to say that even the largest of the", "211:02", "bones such as the thigh bones were", "211:04", "broken squarely across in places", "211:06", "indicating that some considerable force", "211:08", "had been exerted upon them any", "211:11", "conclusion as to an agency powerful", "211:13", "enough to cause such destruction must be", "211:15", "highly speculative so basically what", "211:19", "you're seeing here is a Mastodon that", "211:21", "got smashed into into the ground Wow", "211:24", "the the forces there were strong", "211:27", "powerful shear forces that would have", "211:29", "literally separated his leg from the", "211:31", "foot that's still in immersed into the", "211:34", "into the ground so I mean there are many", "211:37", "examples of this and the last slide", "211:39", "we're gonna show if you go back this I", "211:42", "promise once went digging with Jack", "211:45", "Horner that paleontologist the dinosaur", "211:47", "digger and he he showed these debris", "211:50", "flow pile ups of dinosaur bones that had", "211:54", "been splintered and broken Wow and these", "211:56", "are huge just from the force of the", "211:59", "water and then piling up at the a of a", "212:01", "wall and so if we can do it to a", "212:04", "dinosaur Wow right yeah 85 85 is an", "212:10", "interesting slide because what it shows", "212:11", "is the London ivory docks which over a", "212:15", "period of about two centuries this was", "212:19", "this was mammoth ivory that's being dug", "212:22", "out of the Siberian permafrost that's", "212:24", "just a drawing oh that's just a drawing", "212:26", "yeah with that like that's what it", "212:31", "looked like", "212:34", "19th century scene showing the ivory", "212:37", "floor of the London Docks covered by", "212:38", "thousands of mammoth tusks and this went", "212:40", "on year after year after year after year", "212:43", "for roughly two", "212:44", "centuries there is so much of that", "212:46", "mammoth ivory by the way that they use", "212:48", "it to make knife handles so they", "212:49", "actually have a knife handle you that I", "212:52", "that was made out of mammoth ivory yeah", "212:54", "and still to this day not only is it", "212:56", "legal but it's common to use mammoth", "212:59", "ivory for different kinds of things", "213:01", "there's so much of it well they're not", "213:02", "all dangered species because they're", "213:04", "it's kind of a loophole in this case so", "213:07", "what we have is tucks that are being", "213:09", "again dug out of the permafrost right so", "213:12", "how did they get there that becomes the", "213:14", "question right does it have anything to", "213:16", "do with human predation or was it a", "213:18", "natural catastrophe that somehow ended", "213:20", "up putting all these mammoths down and", "213:23", "burying them into permafrost that's the", "213:25", "question I want to raise well I think we", "213:28", "raised a lot of questions I think we we", "213:30", "got some pretty good answers I think we", "213:32", "had some great dialogue and I really", "213:34", "appreciate your time all three of you", "213:35", "guys and thank you to Malcolm and thank", "213:37", "you to mark and thank you to young Jaime", "213:39", "oh thanks for hosting
