sports section", "44:53", "so it's like there's so much value in", "44:56", "traveling around with material because", "44:58", "you gain different perspectives oh sure", "45:00", "the road is so critical for that yeah", "45:01", "get a sense of how people especially", "45:03", "you're doing clubs I find that the road", "45:05", "when you're doing clubs you really get a", "45:07", "sense of like the feel of a city whether", "45:08", "it's Cleveland or close yes yeah I mean", "45:11", "I love the fact even you know how you", "45:16", "know doing talking about you know I make", "45:18", "a point of not doing too much material", "45:21", "on having five kids but like I'll do", "45:24", "like if I talk about having five kids in", "45:27", "New York City in at a show in New York", "45:30",

of", "45:52", "view but it's tweaked a little bit and", "45:53", "it's so fun kind of traveling around and", "45:56", "learning that material and learning the", "46:00", "impact and how it's digested", "46:01", "well comics have a unique perspective on", "46:04", "America because of that because we don't", "46:06", "just go to these different places but we", "46:08", "also perform material in all these", "46:10", "different places so I think like we've", "46:12", "been talking a lot with comics lately", "46:14", "about like what was your reaction to", "46:16", "Trump winning the election comics saw it", "46:19", "coming more than most people who live in", "46:22", "LA because most people live in LA very", "46:24", "liberal very left-wing convinced that", "46:27", "you know this is even it didn't didn't", "46:29", "matter who you voted for Hillary was", "46:30", "gonna win California no matter what yeah", "46:31", "like we were the", "46:32", "is a pro yeah Democrat state and when", "46:36", "Trump won", "46:37", "I've ran into people that were", "46:39", "shell-shocked they couldn't fucking", "46:41", "imagine I mean I think I mean I was", "46:43", "surprised I was definitely surprised but", "46:46", "that being said I wasn't surprised by", "46:52", "the the logic behind some of the people", "46:57", "that voted for Trump last time that are", "47:00", "sheepish to admit it now yes I", "47:03", "understood some of that logic but I", "47:06", "thought it was fascinating because there", "47:08", "was a time for me because I tour with", "47:11", "Ted Alexandro a lot and he's like not", "47:13", "dead he's like he's like an Occupy Wall", "47:15", "Street guy like he is like very", "47:18", "progressive and we would tour and he", "47:21", "would have during the election he would", "47:24", "have some material on Hillary and some", "47:26", "material on Trump and it worked", "47:28", "everywhere worked when taxes worked in", "47:30", "Tennessee which i think is the most", "47:31", "conservative place outside of Nashville", "47:33", "and and so it will work everywhere and", "47:36", "then the election happened and that same", "47:40", "material and it wasn't just the context", "47:42", "of the at post election it was I", "47:46", "describe it as people looking at the", "47:49", "ceiling is that people didn't want to", "47:52", "hear it and I think some of it is people", "47:55", "like we deal with this all day we need a", "47:57", "break from it but it was both sides yeah", "48:00", "so like Trump voters were more", "48:02", "emboldened kind of like that's right and", "48:04", "then also the left people were like", "48:07", "please can i I just want to hear Jim", "48:11", "talk about horses for 10 minutes do I", "48:14", "mean and so there is something", "48:16", "fascinating that occurs and there's also", "48:18", "something fascinating about", "48:19", "international shows because when Bush", "48:23", "was when w was president there were much", "48:26", "more people coming up to me going how", "48:28", "dare he is you know start the Iraq war", "48:31", "and with with Trump they're like yeah", "48:34", "you probably didn't have anything to do", "48:36", "with that yes I would say that's my", "48:38", "takeaway", "48:39", "yeah it's people are definitely fatigued", "48:43", "I think we have a political discourse", "48:46", "fatigue", "48:46", "it's never-ending never-ending and it's", "48:50", "how much of you is your life if you", "48:52", "really stop and think about if you're", "48:53", "alive for 75 85 years on this planet and", "48:57", "most of your waking time interacting", "49:00", "with people is discussing politics how", "49:02", "much of it actually does

I've lost fights but bombing on", "85:39", "stage might feel worse it might be the", "85:42", "worst feeling you could ever feel other", "85:44", "than like physical pain yeah you know", "85:46", "there is something about it I always", "85:49", "think it's weird when people will say I", "85:51", "can never do that", "85:53", "and and in some ways I think comedians", "85:56", "we forget because there are particularly", "85:58", "at the beginning there are dark days", "86:01", "there are levels of humiliation that", "86:05", "most normal people would go don't ever", "86:08", "do this but comedians are such lunatics", "86:13", "that they're like that's fine that's", "86:16", "fine and by the way what they don't", "86:18", "realize is there's some of us that break", "86:20", "through and we can kind of figure it out", "86:22", "but there are some people that tries to", "86:25", "end up fail miserably have the", "86:28", "perseverance and never get better", "86:31", "that's true it's brutal there's certain", "86:33", "there's a certain mindset that never", "86:36", "improves and I don't know what that is I", "86:40", "don't know if it's a genetic thing if", "86:42", "it's a lack of brain horsepower there's", "86:46", "certain people that just never get it", "86:47", "they never get it and they try and they", "86:49", "don't and they just they never they", "86:50", "never figure their way through and there", "86:52", "is also something about I have a big", "86:55", "belief that comedy changes just as we", "86:58", "were talking about you know there's a", "87:01", "difference between political correctness", "87:02", "and like there is a cultural trend", "87:07", "that's almost kind of looking for", "87:09", "someone making a mistake that it's", "87:12",

in the 80s but I think now", "88:30", "the authenticity is the audience is like", "88:33", "oh that's a great joke but that's not", "88:36", "your girlfriend or your dad or your", "88:37", "brother or like Joe and I'm saying yeah", "88:40", "you have to maybe if you're like a real", "88:42", "absurdist and like yeah", "88:45", "obvious you're lying about everything", "88:46", "and the part of the
