their", "24:00", "back yeah yeah yeah I think that it's an", "24:02", "artificial environment like the cage and", "24:05", "it's also it's hard to see like if", "24:07", "you're in the audience I mean it's it's", "24:09", "actually better sometimes to be home", "24:11", "watch I like that I like the boxing", "24:12", "rings for fights I mean they go through", "24:14", "the ropes now and then what", "24:16", "right but it's a lot better for people", "24:18", "at home watching and for the live crowd", "24:20", "there's just not that cage by area that", "24:23", "focus problem yeah hey eyes and cameras", "24:25", "right I agree I think Bellator actually", "24:27", "nailed it with their kickboxing ring", "24:29", "because they put this big circle around", "24:31", "it so you can't fall through like", "24:33", "remember when Bernard Hopkins fought Joe", "24:34", "Smith right in his last fight he went", "24:36", "through the ropes and landed on his", "24:38", "fucking head yeah I mean this is a", "24:39", "terrible way for a legend to go out yeah", "24:42", "like this is it's the rope ropes were", "24:44", "loose and he gets clipped while he was", "24:46", "already going down he just goes right", "24:47", "through the wall yeah that's ridiculous", "24:49", "that he could fall four feet in and land", "24:51", "on his fucking head that was that was", "24:53", "the fight where Bernard was talking tons", "24:54", "of shit before the fight right was he", "24:56", "talking about shit yeah he was talking a", "24:57", "lot as well as his last fight you know", "24:59", "probably

title", "25:49", "there and Antoine Echols got on the card", "25:52", "because Michael Nunn was the", "25:54", "pound-for-pound best fighter in the", "25:55", "world he was out of that port Iowa also", "25:56", "where right so they were doing a bunch", "25:59", "of sparring they were training down", "26:00", "there getting used to the altitude and", "26:02", "Antoine walked into the gym and

"26:35", "do you think it's great to just go to", "26:36", "war I just you know you know there has", "26:38", "to be a limit obviously because the ties", "26:40", "don't do it like that at all", "26:41", "well here's the thing though that's", "26:42", "because the locations the knees the", "26:44", "elbows all that sort of stuff but it's", "26:45", "also cuz they fight a lot right yeah", "26:47", "they're fighting every week yeah you", "26:48", "know so that that's that you're smart", "26:50", "but you know the thing is you can't then", "26:53", "I say it a million times I've said

"27:25", "it was actually right I mean so it just", "27:28", "it happens with time and you've", "27:29", "experienced that with everything you've", "27:30", "done right yeah you just become much", "27:32", "more customed to it and then you become", "27:34", "more relaxed but I wonder like is there", "27:37", "a way to keep the speed but at least", "27:40", "take something off the shots well that's", "27:43", "the thing is where you put the shin pads", "27:44", "on the headgear the 16-ounce gloves you", "27:46", "know at high speed you go hard you hit", "27:48", "takedowns hard all that
