accepted", "103:19", "hypocritical way I mean it's it's oddly", "103:21", "accepted but we all have freezers full", "103:24", "of the best meat there is and eat it", "103:25", "every night and it's amazing I'm never", "103:27", "going to stop we do yeah we hunt we do", "103:30", "yeah that we actually have that", "103:32", "connection would that meat we killed it", "103:33", "we skinned it we got the meat we debone", "103:35", "it we packed it out we packaged it and", "103:37", "put in our freezers ourselves but this", "103:39", "is the first actually and awesome if", "103:40", "it's the first I've seen someone get", "103:42", "attacked it's something that's a meat", "103:43", "animal because I've seen people maybe", "103:46", "they don't know what's a meat animal but", "103:47",

"something that's a predator people for", "103:57", "whatever weird reason freak out more", "103:59", "than anything well and if there's and if", "104:02", "there's like a like a like a like a", "104:03", "general idea that they're endangered", "104:06", "right you know I mean like everybody", "104:07", "thinks that lions are endangered where", "104:09", "elephants are ending", "104:11", "or even bears or pairing bears you know", "104:13", "so yeah there's a lot of misconceptions", "104:16", "out there for sure but I don't really", "104:18", "eat lions or elephants rating like that", "104:20", "I deer and there's millions of deer", "104:23", "millions yeah literally yeah yeah I mean", "104:25", "we're we hunt in lanai has 3,000 people", "104:29", "more they estimate somewhere over 20,000", "104:32", "deer and they don't even know I mean", "104:34", "it's just bananas I'm on a text thread", "104:36", "with with Benny O'Brien and Rennie and", "104:39", "and I'll and all you guys and and there", "104:41", "was a stat that they were saying", "104:42", "yesterday I don't know if you're on that", "104:44", "yeah text and they were saying it like", "104:46", "in one of the Midwest states I don't", "104:48", "know which one it was do you remember", "104:49", "and in in one of the Midwest states like", "104:52", "850,000 deer died during gun season and", "104:56", "half of them like 400,000 deer died in", "104:58", "the first two days because because we", "105:00", "were talking about Adam being in the", "105:02", "tree that's crazy", "105:03", "and that in one state alone 850,000 deer", "105:06", "died during gun season so you think of", "105:08", "how many deer that is imagine if no one", "105:10", "hunted for like three years", "105:11", "what was that stat how many deer there", "105:13", "would be the number of car accidents", "105:16", "nationwide with deer I think it's a", "105:20", "million and a half I mean but the people", "105:23", "who get angry at the photos don't think", "105:25", "of what it would be like if you just", "105:27", "stopped hunting ya know the Majan how", "105:29", "many goats are be imagine yeah", "105:33", "nature would sort itself out it wouldn't", "105:35", "well it would eventually be enough to", "105:37", "bring in wolves if you're comfortable", "105:39", "with wolves eating your kids I mean", "105:40", "that's what all that big bad wolf shit", "105:43", "from when we were little kids like", "105:44", "little pig little pig let me in that's", "105:46", "because wolves were everywhere and they", "105:48", "were bad it was dangerous like you would", "105:50", "go through a fair game he was kids yeah", "105:53", "that's that's that really did happen", "105:54", "yeah we just we've got so far away from", "105:57", "that we forgot of it as a possibility", "105:59", "yeah so now we think of them as dogs", "106:00", "that are living their natural that dogs", "106:02", "just living his best life out in the", "106:05", "woods how love it when they howl there", "106:08", "they're trying to figure out how to eat", "106:09", "you they want to get through your house", "106:11", "they're trying to figure out how to eat", "106:12", "your kids and if you reintroduce him in", "106:15", "the Yellowstone they're never gonna", "106:15", "leave Yellowstone they're gonna stay", "106:17", "there they're gonna stay right in this", "106:18", "little pocket of where they like to live", "106:21", "they're never gonna reproduce and the", "106:23", "lengths", "106:24", "there you know that's what those people", "106:26", "think but really they're gonna just", "106:28", "start roaming and yeah and recreating", "106:30", "thousands and thousands and thousands of", "106:32", "wolves that are all gonna go into like", "106:34", "neighborhoods eventually yeah well", "106:36", "that's what's happening and that's", "106:37", "what's happening in Montana that's", "106:38", "what's happening", "106:39", "I know yeah I mean these are all", "106:40", "reintroduced wolves that are I mean and", "106:42", "they also go on these surplus kills or", "106:44", "they'll kill like 15 elk and just leave", "106:46", "them there they just go nutty yeah", "106:48", "that's what they do my friend lives in", "106:50", "Montana and he was telling me that the", "106:52", "wolf population is so out of hand that", "106:54", "the elk population has been decimated it", "106:58", "was it's down by like 80 percent or", "107:00", "something some crazy stat crazy yeah", "107:05", "they weren't there in 1994 I mean that's", "107:08", "when they reintroduced him right in the", "107:09", "90s yeah I mean there's I mean now that", "107:13", "the he I mean now that human population", "107:16", "is is so established in a lot of these", "107:18", "areas and you can't just reintroduce", "107:20", "wolves with no plan to keep keep a lid", "107:22", "on it well there is a plan but the", "107:24", "problem with the plan is the established", "107:26", "numbers that they needed to achieve and", "107:28", "before they started managing the", "107:29", "population there was immediate lawsuits", "107:32", "by animal rights activists who don't", "107:33", "want them to ever hunt wolf right so in", "107:36", "Montana they've opened up seasons", "107:37", "they've opened up seasons in Idaho", "107:39", "they've opened up seasons for wolves and", "107:40", "they would like to do the same for", "107:41", "grizzly bears in a lot of these areas", "107:43", "and there's a lot of pushback on that", "107:44", "too but it's the same sort of thing the", "107:46", "established numbers that they needed to", "107:48", "achieve in order to make it a", "107:49", "sustainable population they've been", "107:51", "reached and then the wildlife biologists", "107:53", "the ones who are objective about are", "107:55", "saying hey we need to keep these", "107:56", "populations in check in order to keep", "107:58", "the deer populations healthy and the", "107:59", "moose populations healthy because these", "108:01", "bears and these wolves they're just", "108:03", "destroying these calves and they just", "108:05", "run around then and the populations", "108:06", "these animals go way down now there's", "108:08", "also an argument and a really good one", "108:10", "that you need predators and this good", "108:13", "argument is you don't ever want Lanai to", "108:16", "be recreated in Montana right yes just", "108:19", "these deer and just these elk yeah you", "108:22", "want a certain Natural Balance and so", "108:24", "there's an argument that there should be", "108:26", "a certain amount of wolves and I agree", "108:28", "with that argument I agree too but the", "108:30", "balance can be really difficult to", "108:31", "maintain yeah that's that's my point is", "108:33", "like if there's too many elk and you", "108:35", "want to control that number say there's", "108:37", "a hundred thousand", "108:37", "but there should only be 50,000 oh", "108:39", "that's that's the perfect number right", "108:41", "it's actually pretty easy to go from a", "108:43", "hundred thousand at fifty thousand to", "108:44", "draw that elk herd back pretty easy", "108:46", "through through management and through", "108:48", "hunting same with deer you can pull that", "108:50", "number back pretty quick", "108:51", "wolves are freaking hard to kill dude", "108:53", "yeah you had to kill a wolf and you had", "108:56", "a gun it's freaking hard real if you had", "108:59", "to kill a deer and you had a gun not", "109:01", "that hard right you can find deer", "109:03", "finding a wolf is freaking hard dude", "109:05", "well once those what my my point is is", "109:08", "once those wolf numbers get out of hand", "109:10", "trying to manage that population the", "109:12", "wolf population is very very difficult", "109:14", "well places that are used to dealing", "109:16", "with them they know what the fuck to do", "109:17", "like Alaska yeah and everything they", "109:19", "trap them they fly around in planes and", "109:22", "shoot them out of the out of the air", "109:23", "with helicopters I mean they eradicate", "109:26", "them and that Sarah Palin I don't think", "109:29", "she's doing that anymore but there's a", "109:30", "lot of people up there that do do that", "109:32", "and you can buy wolf skin rugs that they", "109:35", "sell those skins and turn them into rugs", "109:38", "and do all sorts of different things", "109:39", "with the pelts gotta do something yeah", "109:41", "they do something with its but they do", "109:44", "that because they have a vested interest", "109:46", "in keeping the population of their game", "109:48", "animals alive yeah for a couple reasons", "109:50", "and there's criticism about that too", "109:52", "that they may be killed too many wolves", "109:54", "yeah because they don't they want you to", "109:57", "be able to go there and a lot of their", "109:59", "tourism dollars comes from people that", "110:00", "fly in to hunt moose or flying to hunt", "110:02", "deer and they want to make sure they", "110:04", "keep certain populations of them there", "110:06", "so it's it's all there's a real problem", "110:09", "when you get emotions and you have those", "110:11", "emotions tied in to this idea of", "110:13", "wildlife biology and what an animal is", "110:16", "and keeping healthy numbers of these", "110:17", "animals in a certain area that's that's", "110:20", "a real becomes a real issue you know and", "110:22", "that's why when this goat thing happens", "110:25", "and everybody freaks out over it's like", "110:26", "you should probably educate yourself as", "110:28", "to what you're talking about before you", "110:30", "start complaining because you're just", "110:31", "throwing gasoline on this fire then you", "110:34", "don't necessarily understand all the", "110:36", "circumstances involved those goats are", "110:38", "gnarly too because you know because they", "110:39", "live where I live and they on they love", "110:43", "shorelines", "110:44", "and they love like ridges and berms and", "110:46", "stuff like that and they're they're", "110:47", "they're they create so much erosion", "110:49", "because they love those", "110:51", "like edges on cliffs and stuff and so", "110:54", "they they ruin all the burns originally", "110:56", "they ruin all the cliffs and then", "110:58", "there's all this runoff there's all this", "110:59", "erosion and they I mean they completely", "111:02", "decimate all the grass all the weeds all", "111:04", "the way down they don't they don't just", "111:05", "trim things they're not they're not", "111:07", "selective eaters", "111:08", "they'll just chow down all the way to", "111:09", "the to the roots and then eat the roots", "111:11", "also there's nothing holding that dirt", "111:12", "in place right so when it rains", "111:14", "just everything spills downhill because", "111:16", "of the goats they really I see I see it", "111:18", "and with deer you can see some some", "111:20", "impact that they have for sure I let", "111:23", "those numbers get out of hand they have", "111:24", "the same effect but goats goats are", "111:26", "radical they the populations explode and", "111:29", "and if if someone's not managing them", "111:32", "that you can see the impact that they", "111:33", "have on the land and that'll have an", "111:35", "impact on all the native species oh yeah", "111:37", "all the ground nesting birds yeah all", "111:39", "the animals that use that those the", "111:41", "grass and those yeah bushes or less", "111:44", "different things for cover and for life", "111:45", "yeah it's and what they things that they", "111:48", "feed off of all the stuff it gets eaten", "111:49", "by the goats you know yeah if there's a", "111:51", "large population of goat somewhere", "111:52", "you'll know it yeah did they like almost", "111:55", "nothing left", "111:56", "I appreciate these people like Glenn", "111:59", "Greenwald I appreciate the sentiment", "112:01", "behind it I really who I just wish they", "112:03", "would look into it a little bit deeper", "112:04", "and you know this woman's not a bad", "112:06", "person she's just that's how she gets", "112:08", "her meat you know yep like I said", "112:11", "especially a guy like Ricky who have met", "112:13", "after I've actually talked about hunting", "112:15", "with him on a radio show before I did on", "112:18", "the Opie and Anthony show I had to", "112:19", "explain to him that I'm a hunter then I", "112:21", "I hunt animals and I eat him because he", "112:23", "was talking about hunters and and he was", "112:25", "actually very friendly with me and we", "112:27", "were cool about and we had a good he's", "112:28", "like as long as you eat it like that's", "112:29", "what you're doing it for I'm like that's", "112:31", "exactly what I do it for but he eats me", "112:33", "too which is so it's a whole it's weird", "112:35", "it's the the the fact that people think", "112:39", "like that
