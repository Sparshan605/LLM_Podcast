"09:40", "substitution it's I don't think people", "09:42", "who haven't done it realized how", "09:44", "difficult it is and then I think people", "09:46", "who've done it they definitely know how", "09:48", "hard it is and that is one of the as you", "09:51", "mentioned one of the hardest things to", "09:52", "do but that's why that that's why that", "09:54", "video of you and Utah 67 yards and it", "09:58", "was just like we had been in on bulls", "10:00", "like had opportunity with the moment the", "10:05", "beginning in the morning it was a rock", "10:07", "house it was right today but these", "10:09", "opportunities were like right there or", "10:10", "you could almost grab them and they", "10:13", "would they were gone and it didn't", "10:15", "happen and in that one just enough time", "10:18", "but he's like you had to do it all you", "10:20", "know that like the clock's ticking like", "10:22", "it's not you don't know you don't have", "10:24", "unlimited time that bull takes a step", "10:27", "yeah it's over yep and for you to make", "10:31", "that shot so perfect in crunch time that", "10:33", "was such a beautiful thing he's like", "10:35", "that's why it elicited the orgy type", "10:39", "response well that's also why I said", "10:42", "afterwards the practice is so important", "10:44", "that's always thinking yeah that's what", "10:45", "you said that's it you said practice", "10:47", "something about practice and it's like", "10:49", "that's what it goes down so that's the", "10:50", "building block yeah and it's just those", "10:53", "reps because you can't I guess you could", "10:55", "get make a lucky shot but the chances of", "10:59", "screwing that up are very high unless", "11:01", "you got the reps yeah my thought process", "11:04", "when I was making that shot was", "11:08", "exactly the thought process that I go", "11:09", "through when I'm practicing and that's", "11:12", "why and when I executed and I saw that", "11:15", "arrow hit exactly where I was aiming", "11:16", "beautiful it was I was that's the first", "11:19", "thought that came into my mind practice", "11:20", "it's so important well and then I was", "11:23", "impressed because you actually made", "11:24", "notes to yourself oh yeah on your phone", "11:26", "yeah so what", "11:27", "tell me walk me through your your your", "11:30", "procedure your process have I even added", "11:33", "to it oh you did yeah because there's a", "11:35", "certain way I like to grip the the", "11:39", "release that I didn't put in yeah so", "11:42", "back straight strong posture drawback", "11:46", "elbow high light pressure on the nose", "11:48", "Center the peep level the bubble now", "11:51", "this is the new one that I added connect", "11:53", "the fuck you finger to the thumb because", "11:55", "is this finger yeah as to connect to the", "11:57", "thermal release as I pull back yeah", "11:59", "because I use that silver back release", "12:01", "yeah I pull back with the index trigger", "12:04", "pick a spot pull with the scapula and", "12:07", "then the last one be the arrow right you", "12:09", "know we're talking that what is that", "12:10", "Warren so what does that mean Remmy", "12:12", "Warren said well REM the whole thing no", "12:15", "no the arrow like B I'm not not hoping", "12:19", "yeah that it hits in that spot I'm", "12:21", "aiming I'm good I want I'm concentrating", "12:25", "100% on that arrow going to that spot", "12:28", "yeah Remmy Warren said that to me one", "12:30", "time he goes he goes this sounds crazy", "12:32", "but someone gave me this advice and it's", "12:34", "like the best advice anybody ever gave", "12:35", "me said be the arrow yeah he goes like I", "12:37", "don't know what that means but like I am", "12:39", "I don't know different things to", "12:41", "different people yeah but to you it", "12:42", "means yeah you're in you're so in the", "12:45", "moment yes you're the arrow I'm a", "12:47", "hundred percent foot when that arrows", "12:49", "released I am a part of it as it's going", "12:52", "towards that out right the arrow like", "12:55", "don't just oh I hope it works like I got", "12:58", "that from Joel Turner as well you know", "13:00", "Joel Turner has that shot IQ website", "13:02", "yeah and he goes over and he helped me a", "13:04", "lot because he goes over the difference", "13:07", "between a closed loop and an open loop", "13:08", "process I always forget which one is", "13:10", "which but one of them is automatic you", "13:13", "know like like a ball comes at you swing", "13:16", "a bat you can't stop in the process and", "13:18", "the other one is you're in control of it", "13:21", "every step", "13:21", "the way and that's where a shot routine", "13:23", "helps me because you think I'm thinking", "13:25", "I'm making sure that all my things are", "13:27", "checked off so there's no there's no", "13:29", "chance I'm doing anything wacky right", "13:31", "there's no chance you're spazzing out in", "13:33", "the moment yeah", "13:34", "and so that those two things and then", "13:37", "what Remy said be the arrow like that", "13:40", "sounds like to someone who's never shot", "13:42", "an arrow that doesn't make any sense but", "13:43", "when there's a thing that you do when", "13:47", "you release an arrow where you're so", "13:49", "focused your technique is on point", "13:51", "everything's everything's lined up but", "13:53", "you're so focused as you're releasing", "13:55", "that you never break that focus right", "13:57", "the only thing the only way I could", "13:58", "break it was when I heard that our walk", "14:00", "and I saw it hit right in the sweet spot", "14:03", "I was like now I can relax yeah you know", "14:05", "and I remember and I said this at that", "14:08", "time but I remember your follow-through", "14:09", "it was just like so I remember that arm", "14:12", "coming back and is just I don't know", "14:15", "it's you know and I think that's where a", "14:17", "lot of people make mistakes is if you're", "14:20", "new in it and there's so much pressure", "14:21", "in the moment in that moment you've", "14:24", "thought about it for so long that it's", "14:26", "just like the pin goes on the animal and", "14:29", "they punch the trigger yeah because they", "14:31", "wanted they wanted they want to be there", "14:34", "before they've went through the process", "14:36", "yeah and so that's where people screw up", "14:38", "and all that whole thing you making that", "14:42", "a actual process each step but I think I", "14:47", "don't know do you do it or is it", "14:50", "subconscious you know do you think about", "14:52", "all those steps I was thinking about all", "14:54", "those steps while I was walking okay", "14:56", "while I'm going through the woods I'm", "14:58", "thinking about those I don't know shot", "14:59", "I'm just kinda matica subconscious but", "15:03", "that's why I said practice is so", "15:04", "important yeah this is like I'd", "15:05", "practiced it so many times that I just", "15:08", "looked at that elk like it was a target", "15:09", "yeah", "15:09", "I knew what to do and just but it was", "15:12", "only because of the wraps wraps right", "15:14", "wraps wraps wraps that moment was so", "15:17", "crazy because you know we had that bull", "15:22", "I don't know if his that ball but as a", "15:23", "big bowl but we were stuck over more to", "15:26", "the left and we could see him up there", "15:29", "he had these little smaller satellite", "15:31", "bowls kind of in the way we were in the", "15:33", "Sun which", "15:34", "driving me crazy so he ended up having a", "15:37", "circle all the way back around and get", "15:38", "back up there had a line of spruce we", "15:40", "could sneak up but uh it was you know", "15:43", "those bulls the bull you shot went and", "15:46", "fought with another bull for a brief", "15:47", "time and we were switching back and", "15:49", "forth which one is shoot cuz they're", "15:51", "both big bulls and it's just like just", "15:53", "to be able to slow that down and make", "15:56", "such a perfect shot in a moment like", "15:58", "that oh my god is so hard it was so", "16:00", "awesome so that yeah it was so amazing", "16:03", "but it's so hard oh this is the this is", "16:06", "it yeah", "16:06", "he just got done fighting with a bowl so", "16:17", "he runs I can't see it in this film he", "16:20", "runs up this Ridge right here and boom", "16:22", "he's down right there I mean couple", "16:26", "seconds late but this is everything that", "16:28", "you hope for as a bow hunter yeah you", "16:30", "know it was a mitt and I see a lot of", "16:33", "people who haven't hunted they ant", "16:35", "they're under the impression that maybe", "16:38", "as soon as you the arrow hits the animal", "16:40", "how come he didn't go down right what I", "16:43", "mean because they just don't know so", "16:44", "that bull was alive", "16:47", "four seconds after that essentially he", "16:49", "ran up probably went about a hundred", "16:51", "yards", "16:52", "he ran until

understand what", "36:49", "they say when people say like public", "36:52", "land is harder it is harder but here's", "36:54", "the problem with that you're dealing", "36:55", "with a pressured animal I don't want to", "36:57", "deal with pressured animals I know that", "36:59", "you deal I know it's harder it's harder", "37:01", "to have success in public land but I", "37:03", "don't think it's better because dealing", "37:05", "with all those people that are going", "37:07", "after the same animals and those act", "37:08", "like like we're now I was talking about", "37:10", "elk that were

chased down because they're so", "37:19", "fucking pressured and wolves have yeah", "37:22", "have the help don't call around wolves", "37:24", "the other because the wolves come yeah", "37:26", "so it like what I found is because I've", "37:30", "done it you know I public I was only on", "37:32", "public land for 20 years you know and I", "37:34", "couldn't afford anything else so I", "37:36", "haven't found that that that killing an", "37:39", "elk is any easier or harder it's just", "37:42", "they're bigger because they're older", "37:44", "yeah so I can still I've always killed", "37:46", "bulls but they", "37:47", "they're gonna be like a three-year-old", "37:48", "bull a five-point right now I'm gonna", "37:50", "kill a ten-year-old bowl it's still a", "37:52", "bowl but it's just different they just", "37:54", "on public land there's not as many that", "37:56", "are getting to that age class because", "37:58", "every other hunter out there is gonna", "38:00", "shoot the first bull they see right so", "38:02", "yeah that's the difference it's not the", "38:04", "hunting doesn't seem harder or easier to", "38:06", "me or different it's still killing a", "38:09", "bull with an arrow but just that that", "38:11", "size when you go to private land you", "38:13", "have more opportunities as more animals", "38:15", "but to me they're acting wild they're", "38:19", "acting like wild animals because they're", "38:21", "not pressured because there's not that", "38:22", "many people out there so it's rare that", "38:24", "they encounter people and you know and", "38:26", "when you're in a place like we were at", "38:28", "which is 270,000 acres in Utah they're", "38:31", "all just living in the mountains like", "38:33", "they've been living in the mountains for", "38:35", "thousands of years that's to me it's a", "38:38", "pure experience and I know it's not", "38:40", "available to everybody and I know you", "38:41", "have to pay money to do it and I get", "38:43", "that I get that it's not available to", "38:45", "the average working man I get it but", "38:48", "it's definitely harder to do public land", "38:52", "without doubt mm-hmm but I don't think", "38:54", "it's as good the reason why I don't", "38:56", "think it's as good because those animals", "38:58", "are acting like animals that are being", "38:59", "hunted all the time they're pressured", "39:01", "I've been I've on been on public land", "39:03", "hunts I get the difference and it's", "39:05", "definitely more satisfying when you're", "39:07", "successful because it's more difficult", "39:08", "and I know how people can take pride in", "39:11", "that but I think a lot of the pride", "39:12", "they're taking in it they're taking the", "39:14", "because they don't have the option like", "39:16", "if you could say to these people that", "39:18", "are talking shit like you say hey would", "39:21", "you like a free hunt at the Deseret in", "39:24", "Utah maybe like yeah of course they", "39:26", "would say yes they didn't want to", "39:28", "experience what we experienced that day", "39:30", "which was a pure wild rut fest pure wild", "39:35", "experience where these animals just", "39:36", "going off I mean we're deep deep deep", "39:39", "into the mountains they're by themselves", "39:41", "they're all bedded down up there there's", "39:44", "a hot cow and they're all going crazy", "39:45", "and fighting each other mean just the", "39:47", "sounds that we were hearing was so epic", "39:49", "that video that you got of us walking is", "39:52", "here all day yeah all day they were", "39:56", "going off is it amazing we hit the", "39:58", "perfect spot that best spot that", "40:00", "day that time yeah that was it and I've", "40:03", "I've I've been in rough fast on public", "40:05", "land you know I mean they that's how", "40:08", "they act and that's in the wilderness", "40:09", "deep where they're not getting so it's", "40:11", "like you always I've always looked for", "40:13", "places my whole career hunting career", "40:16", "where the animal I'm not I'm not", "40:19", "competing against Tom Dick and Harry and", "40:22", "elk right you know so to me that was", "40:24", "always like well the way I can do that", "40:27", "is go further than anybody wants to go", "40:29", "so I'd go to the wilderness to hunt", "40:31", "those so it's essentially that without", "40:33", "having to go 12 miles deep right right", "40:36", "right", "40:36", "you know and it's it's those elk are", "40:41", "they're acting natural and you know I've", "40:45", "been on the other side though to I get", "40:47", "what the guys are saying I get it when I", "40:48", "couldn't hunt my goal has always been to", "40:52", "go on the best outcomes I could right", "40:54", "sometimes that was instead of hunting", "40:57", "the Oregon Coast that was going to", "40:59", "Eastern Oregon then I went from Eastern", "41:02", "Oregon to Wyoming I'm like oh my god", "41:04", "this is so much better than Oregon it", "41:06", "was better then I went from wyoming to", "41:09", "colorado colorado that's right", "41:12", "Eastman's had me going in 2005 i killed", "41:15", "seven by six in wyoming then they said", "41:18", "the next year and that was will public", "41:21", "land hunt day nine and then it's like", "41:23", "hey 2005 we want to film you on this on", "41:26", "and I'm like well if it's better than", "41:29", "Wyoming I'll go to Colorado that's what", "41:32", "I'm trying to do I'm trying to get a", "41:33", "better hunt and so it's just been that", "41:34", "and so now it's been the places that I", "41:38", "go I spend my month of September they're", "41:40", "the very best places I can find in the", "41:43", "United States and it's just an extension", "41:46", "of that process thirty years ago right", "41:48", "that's it that's all anybody's trying to", "41:49", "do yeah you don't you don't try to go on", "41:51", "worse outcomes some people do that I", "41:54", "don't even really like never did mmm", "41:57", "some people just love the grind", "41:58", "yeah man writes I get the grind but it's", "42:02", "still I did only gonna worse el canto", "42:06", "but they want the bragging rights of", "42:08", "public land but they'll definitely take", "42:10", "a public land limited entry draw tag", "42:13", "yeah", "42:13", "which is essentially like being on a", "42:15", "private land yes nobody can hunt there", "42:17", "no and that's what like back home it's", "42:19", "the winnow hot unit they give twenty tax", "42:21", "20 20 and it's a higher state huge huge", "42:25", "area this is one area it's a people", "42:28", "apply for it as well yeah that I I don't", "42:31", "think they get Oregon's terrible for", "42:33", "out-of-state for non-residents but I", "42:35", "know residents get 20 so huge area 20", "42:39", "tags that's not that much different than", "42:43", "paying a landowner to have this area for", "42:47", "yourself right so I put in for winnow ha", "42:50", "if I you know if I draw it I'm hunting", "42:54", "there it's it's kind of the same thing I", "42:57", "I understand where people are coming", "42:59", "from and whenever someone's got", "43:01", "something that you can't afford you get", "43:03", "that must be honest yeah yeah yeah I I", "43:07", "just the the problem that I have with it", "43:10", "is that the animals when they're", "43:12", "pressured they're not acting natural and", "43:15", "you're dealing with too many people it", "43:17", "definitely gives you better bragging", "43:19", "rights right if you should Alliant Bowl", "43:21", "on public land it's like wow that's", "43:23", "another level of accomplishment that's a", "43:25", "big deal you know that's that's the real", "43:27", "grind like what we're doing is what I'm", "43:30", "doing first of all is the easiest way to", "43:32", "the to the to the road because I've got", "43:34", "some of my best friends are the best", "43:37", "hunters on earth I mean having you as a", "43:39", "great friend and Dudley and being able", "43:41", "to take instruction from you guys and", "43:43", "learning how to had a bow hunting like", "43:46", "just having you that day with me first", "43:48", "of all what a wake up call about", "43:49", "endurance Here I am fucking running", "43:52", "hills every goddamn day trying to keep", "43:54", "up with you is such a fucking bummer man", "43:56", "it's still like it's such it's so", "44:00", "annoying Jamie he gets to the top of the", "44:02", "hill he's not even out of breath I'm", "44:03", "soaked with sweat", "44:05", "I'm heaving in home and I'm like what if", "44:07", "I didn't run like what if I wasn't doing", "44:10", "all this goddamn hill running well that", "44:12", "that one little burst we had because the", "44:14", "wind to get the wind ride and that Bowl", "44:16", "coming over I didn't know if the bull is", "44:18", "coming that was it kind of was a hustle", "44:19", "it was a hustle we had to straight up", "44:21", "out of it straight up", "44:23", "thank God I do that all the time yeah", "44:25", "yeah", "44:26", "you gotta yeah and you did and that's", "44:28", "that's that's bow hunting is like tomato", "44:31", "be able to think you're gonna make an", "44:32", "accurate shot after pushing yourself", "44:34", "like ass that's rough", "44:36", "you very rough that's what I think", "44:38", "people need to understand about like the", "44:40", "reason why you conditioned yourself and", "44:42", "I know you've taken a lot of shit from", "44:43", "lazy hunters that think it's unnecessary", "44:45", "to what to work out as hard as you do", "44:47", "come with us bitch yeah come with us", "44:50", "come that day just do what we did that", "44:52", "day yeah dammit as much as I run I was", "44:55", "still struggling to keep up yeah it's", "44:57", "fucking hard it is and then the whole", "44:59", "thing is your whether or not you can", "45:01", "recover so even though you're heaving", "45:03", "and joven you know he even in even in", "45:06", "Hoenn before we say heave-ho", "45:08", "you're fucking heaving yes you're", "45:10", "gasping for air at the top your heart", "45:13", "rate drops down if you're in shape yeah", "45:14", "even though you've done the sprint", "45:16", "within a minute everything's dropping", "45:18", "back down and then you're cool again the", "45:20", "babies can make the shot the biggest", "45:21", "thing I see is not only that recovery", "45:24", "but making good decisions yeah because", "45:26", "it's still hunting but II still have to", "45:28", "outwit so what happens is when people", "45:30", "get gassed they take shortcuts you know", "45:33", "they get gas from going up the hill hard", "45:36", "trying to get this and then they're like", "45:38", "god do I really have to circle around", "45:39", "and keep the wind right right right", "45:41", "maybe I can just get away with here so", "45:43", "it's like you take shortcuts and you", "45:45", "can't take shortcuts so the more", "45:48", "fatigued you are the more inclined you", "45:49", "are to take shortcuts the better shape", "45:50", "you are you're gonna do it right and", "45:52", "you're gonna make make good decisions", "45:55", "the first Bowl that we got into in the", "45:56", "early morning that bull was that was", "45:59", "like 52 yards and I was at full draw and", "46:03", "he caught a whiff of us yeah and he was", "46:05", "right he was walking right into the path", "46:08", "yeah right into the path he would have", "46:10", "been broadside I mean that would have", "46:12", "been 17 yards closer than the boys shot", "46:15", "or close to it", "46:15", "yeah and he just fucked this pure one", "46:19", "who's gone yeah yeah that wind will get", "46:22", "you their sense of smell and their their", "46:24", "their understanding of their environment", "46:27", "is so humbling yeah it's so amazing to", "46:30", "watch them like peek their head up and", "46:33", "catch your wind for a second then just", "46:34", "start running oh I know and you see I", "46:36", "thought I don't know you see him and", "46:39", "they like kind of they'll", "46:40", "put their nose up don't be like what is", "46:43", "that yeah yeah smoke

small group which", "47:14", "we're fighting for our space in this", "47:15", "world anyway right come on I mean like", "47:18", "when I say you know I was defending at", "47:21", "one time you and

about it they're doing it this", "47:40", "is a win a win what are we doing I mean", "47:44", "cuz you cuz they haven't been out there", "47:46", "for 30 years and couldn't afford an elk", "47:47", "tag it's they shouldn't do it they I", "47:51", "mean come on yes people get", "47:54", "short-sighted and selfish yeah that's it", "47:56", "that's but that's in comedy that's in", "47:58", "everything man that's in everything", "48:00", "there's always gonna be people to think", "48:01", "that way but comedy is not something", "48:03", "that that the public can vote out the", "48:06", "publican wrote out hunting right so we", "48:09", "start cannibalizing ourselves that's not", "48:13", "true I mean you know we could I'm not", "48:16", "gonna say we got some momentum going now", "48:18", "but we could lose it yeah it's possible", "48:21", "there's enough people that are ignorant", "48:22", "to what hunting really is yeah and", "48:24", "enough people that actually eat meat", "48:26", "that are ignorant to what help exactly I", "48:28", "mean it's like 96% of people ready meat", "48:30", "but I think if we explain what how", "48:32", "hunting were sand and but we have to", "48:36", "have all hunters on that same page", "48:38", "supporting each other my wife was at", "48:40", "dinner was with some friends and one of", "48:43", "her friends husbands was asking where", "48:46", "what I do and she said well he's", "48:48", "actually on an elk hunt right now", "48:50", "and the guy was eating a steak and he", "48:52", "goes well that's abhorrent", "48:54", "he's eating a stea and she's laughing at", "48:57", "him because you're eating a steak yeah", "48:59", "do you understand that you're eating a", "49:01", "steak it's crazy and he you know he's", "49:03", "from England then this can all like over", "49:05", "there they don't hunt was they get super", "49:08", "confused and Ricky no", "49:10", "I was a Ricky with your face it's not", "49:14", "Ricky has no problem with people hunting", "49:16", "for food yeah he has a problem with", "49:18", "trophy hunting yeah and I think it also", "49:21", "has a distorted understanding what that", "49:22", "is but people also lump it all on", "49:24", "together yes they do so especially over", "49:26", "in Europe I mean in you know under", "49:29", "whatever but it's a psyche so that's", "49:31", "where I say let's just first of all list", "49:34", "for all hunters be on the same team we", "49:36", "should certainly should be yes and then", "49:38", "get that message out correctly", "49:40", "that's all I've tried to do but one of", "49:42", "the things that I try to do as much as", "49:43", "possible is put those images of my", "49:45", "cooking yeah you know like look look at", "49:48", "that fucking wild dark meat that I'm", "49:51", "cooking and I'm eating all the time all", "49:53", "the goddamn time well and what I also", "49:56", "try to do too and I put one up today and", "49:59", "I think and I think you could even speak", "50:01", "to this because we shared that emotion", "50:04", "with your bull but there is you know", "50:08", "I've said it before and maybe some", "50:10", "hunters think I'm full of shit or or I", "50:13", "don't know I don't know overemphasizing", "50:16", "but the feeling of I'm not happy when I", "50:20", "kill I mean the killing of the animal is", "50:23", "not in like fun so I know an animals", "50:29", "dying I've worked very hard to make that", "50:31", "shot like you made the shot but then", "50:33", "when we got to the animal and there
