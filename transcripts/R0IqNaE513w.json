crazy person", "155:19", "there's something to that too in terms", "155:21", "of memory like if I learned a long time", "155:24", "ago there's a song I want to learn you", "155:27", "got to remember all the words I'm never", "155:30", "gonna remember them until I just sit", "155:31", "down and write that song get down on", "155:34", "paper like one time once I write it on", "155:36", "paper and

you", "156:07", "wrote like it like comes out of nowhere", "156:09", "it goes through you to your pad right", "156:11", "it's like it's almost hard to recapture", "156:14", "that state and then you're like a normal", "156:16", "person trying to remember what you", "156:17", "thought of when you were in that zone", "156:19", "whereas if it was a song that somebody", "156:21", "else made yeah like I love the song I", "156:23", "know I don't know if it's like because", "156:25", "you're reacting", "156:26", "it's stronger or more strongly I mean", "156:29", "well this is I think there's a thing of", "156:32", "creativity that involves the no self", "156:35", "right there's that state that you get", "156:37", "when you row there's a lot of shit that", "156:39", "I write where I go back over
