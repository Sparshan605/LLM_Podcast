term", "09:02", "our you know our metrics for reality", "09:07", "right and that is exactly the the thing", "09:10", "don't worry about whether it's real and", "09:13", "the way we would define real", "09:15", "is it good information or is it bad air", "09:18", "is it not that's the thing it doesn't", "09:20", "matter where it comes right it's such as", "09:21", "if it's good information then it
