easy day for me", "13:47", "I'm sorry but explain that if you're if", "13:51", "your body is not sore but your HRV is", "13:55", "low it's what is it showing what's an", "13:57", "indication of so if

it's it's a big needle for a while", "42:59", "when I did the stem cell injections that", "43:01", "was cool because they used a digital", "43:03", "thermometer sound it's like what you", "43:06", "would used to look at a baby yeah but", "43:08", "you can you can see the tissue you can", "43:10", "see the areas where they're swelling or", "43:11", "there's like a black area where where", "43:13", "the tissue is torn up or whether there's", "43:15", "edema or inflammation and you can and", "43:17", "and he showed me the video after he did", "43:21", "all the injections you can see them", "43:22", "needle like going into the you can you", "43:24", "can micro target exactly exactly where", "43:27", "you want to put the cells yeah I've done", "43:29", "it's very very cool thermography", "43:32", "yeah yeah it's a cool procedure have you", "43:34", "ever done rogem akeem no you aware of it", "43:37", "it's it's one of the things a lot of pro", "43:40", "athletes we're going to Germany need to", "43:41", "get done it's a it's a form of", "43:43", "platelet-rich plasma where they heat it", "43:44", "up and by heating up the the plasma it", "43:48", "produces this

you know", "118:36", "one shot might just be like a simple", "118:38", "25-yard shot a fox where if you get", "118:41", "vitals you'll get five points and if you", "118:43", "hit a body shot then it

it's", "121:06", "not bouncing around and then you put the", "121:08", "weight down in the hips so it works for", "121:09", "running two miles really hard but it's", "121:12", "super uncomfortable and it's not", "121:14", "mechanically favorable sucks but running", "121:17", "yeah so they call that the meat pack and", "121:21", "you have to do it that way or is it just", "121:22", "a matter of how much weight you have on", "121:24", "your back like if you could you use one", "121:26", "of those Atlas packs have you seen those", "121:27", "Atlas things from outdoorsman's it's", "121:29",

use the sandbag", "122:18", "that they issued to you used the same", "122:21", "object so everybody's using a sandbag", "122:24", "just you don't come in with your own", "122:25", "right you know what I was saying that", "122:30", "you painted a 45-pound logo on anyways", "122:33", "those who do the meat pack and any give", "122:35", "certain my time for that and then you do", "122:37", "the obstacle course which is the real", "122:38", "hoot in which they still do which is", "122:40", "because I think got rid of the meat pack", "122:41", "but the obstacle course in fact well", "122:45",

it worked out pretty well", "123:26", "and then they have the obstacle course", "123:28", "which is like crawling under barbed wire", "123:30", "stand shoot and then you're doing like", "123:32", "um you know like sandbag over the", "123:35", "shoulder 20 reps shoot 30 burpees and", "123:37", "and for the opposite of course you have", "123:38", "a 50 pound pack or a 40 pound pack on", "123:40",

stopping and", "123:53", "shooting along the way so it's like", "123:55", "you're you're learning how to just", "123:58", "imagine if you if you're like rushing up", "124:00", "a hill and you got to the top of the", "124:02", "hill and you got a calm your heart where", "124:03", "calm your nervous system very quickly", "124:05", "and get your shot off and granted you're", "124:08", "not necessarily gonna be hauling a", "124:10", "sandbag up that hill and doing a bunch", "124:11", "of burpees but it's kind of simulating", "124:13", "yeah of shooting with your heart rate", "124:15",
