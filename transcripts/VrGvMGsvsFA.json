"nonsense", "06:48", "well maybe there's a core of it that", "06:50", "makes sense but there's it's not going", "06:51", "to get anywhere close to the", "06:53", "achievements of the of the hard sciences", "06:56", "but the core of it whether or not it", "06:58", "makes sense the real problem is the", "06:59", "motivation for doing it in the first", "07:01", "place", "07:01", "well the real motivation may be activism", "07:05", "but Activision activism and scholarship", "07:09", "aren't I mean there's so many things", "07:10", "that I want to be true that just aren't", "07:12", "I want beautiful I mean like you know", "07:16", "nature you spend time in nature you want", "07:19", "to think you know like nature's a", "07:20", "community in where the forest is a bunch", "07:23", "of

this contradicts", "07:42", "everything we want to claim about", "07:44", "organisms well tough luck I feel like", "07:46", "there's a way to define this clearly", "07:48", "that makes people understand it better", "07:50", "okay and I don't I don't know if I'm the", "07:52", "guy to do it but I feel like someone", "07:55", "there's a this is an incredibly complex", "08:00", "issue right

"this stuff yeah these hard sciences that", "08:35", "demand just wriggle is rigorous", "08:38", "intellectual debate they demand", "08:40", "careful study of the facts they demand a", "08:45", "deep understanding of complex", "08:47", "mathematics and", "08:48", "to achieve these results and to be able", "08:50", "to verify them and they're unforgiving", "08:52", "unforgiving yeah there's just they're", "08:54", "two totally different things and what", "08:56", "you're saying is when one of them that", "08:58", "is this sort of for a frivolous Airy", "09:02", "kind of utopian version of what they", "09:07", "like the future to be and interferes", "09:11", "right where they want a certain amount", "09:13", "of diverse people all not half and I'm", "09:15", "not even saying that it's
