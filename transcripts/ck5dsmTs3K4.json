done", "04:26", "it with them yes", "04:28", "you have to i've only done honestly a", "04:29", "couple times they probably played it a", "04:31", "million times", "04:32", "but um you have to coordinate your", "04:34", "movements to mirror the person on the", "04:36", "screen", "04:37", "right but my instincts are to like to", "04:39", "not mirror", "04:40", "but to to do what he's doing if his", "04:42", "right arm is going up my right groin up", "04:44", "right because like that's how you get", "04:45", "taught in martial arts so i'm not sure", "04:47", "if i'm supposed to be doing that or if", "04:49", "i'm supposed to be just mirroring him", "04:51", "like when he lifts up his right arm am i", "04:52", "supposed to live up my left arm", "04:54", "because that's that's the one that faces", "04:56", "me is that how you speak no", "04:57", "you you do whatever you see yeah but", "04:59", "then you have to tran", "05:00", "you have to switch it over in your head", "05:02", "why don't you that arm okay i'll go with", "05:04", "you", "05:04", "we'll do this one it seems like well you", "05:06", "shouldn't have to do this with your", "05:07", "children you should be", "05:09", "the only way i'm gonna do it it seems", "05:11", "like though that", "05:13", "it would be easier for all involved if", "05:15", "you just had the mirror it", "05:16", "not do the same exact side of their body", "05:20", "as your body", "05:21", "i don't know i've not i've never gotten", "05:22", "that deep because i've done it and then", "05:25", "quickly became exhausted and just", "05:27", "pretended i thought it was stupid so i", "05:28", "could lay down well it's critical in", "05:30", "martial arts", "05:31", "that you uh like if you're learning", "05:33", "something if you", "05:34", "prefer like especially kickboxing for", "05:37", "most fighters", "05:38", "most fighters have one good side and one", "05:41", "one side that they're not so good at", "05:42", "right and um like the really great", "05:44", "fighters like", "05:45", "one of the best in the world today is", "05:47", "terence crawford and one of the things", "05:49", "about him is he can fight equally well", "05:51", "from southpaw or from orthodox oh really", "05:54", "yeah so will he switch his stance", "05:56", "yeah he'll he'll do whatever he wants", "05:57", "wow he just fucks people up", "05:59", "he does whatever you want i mean he", "06:00", "fights really top shelf competition too", "06:03", "and he's just", "06:04", "he's so technical and so so clever at", "06:07", "figuring people out but i think he has a", "06:08", "giant advantage", "06:09", "and that he literally as as good a", "06:12", "southpaw as he is", "06:13", "orthodox like he can box the best boxers", "06:15", "in the world orthodox", "06:16", "right and then just switch up southpaw", "06:18", "on them and there's you know he might be", "06:19", "like a little better as a southpaw", "06:21", "but god damn it's so cool my it might", "06:23", "also be he's fucking their head up", "06:25", "because they fought him one way and then", "06:27", "he switches dancing and starts fucking", "06:28", "them up the other way", "06:29", "is he born that way no no it's a learned", "06:31", "thing but my point would be", "06:33", "if you had a southpaw instructor and he", "06:36", "was teaching you", "06:37", "and you were mirroring him it would be", "06:38", "weird right right right", "06:40", "you know right if someone's teaching you", "06:41", "something you want to", "06:43", "see how their body's doing it and and", "06:45", "mimic their movements", "06:47", "right they want to see it and mimic", "06:48", "their movements right you don't want to", "06:50", "mirror it that would be too confusing", "06:51", "yeah which is interesting because it", "06:53", "seems like the mirroring would work", "06:54", "better", "06:55", "if it was the stupid video game you know", "06:57", "because like lift your arm", "07:03", "or any i think any martial arts style", "07:05", "yeah no it's messed you up you can't be", "07:07", "a good", "07:07", "dance revolutionary someone's got to", "07:09", "walk you through it too", "07:11", "dance dance revolutionary i'm probably", "07:12", "doing everything wrong i'm probably", "07:14", "risking all these joints", "07:16", "like there's certain you know who
