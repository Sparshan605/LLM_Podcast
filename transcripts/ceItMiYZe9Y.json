people who are supposedly the", "05:56", "ones who can see the future and every", "05:58", "one of them and I mean every single one", "06:00", "said nobody's gonna view amateur content", "06:03", "because if anybody could make anything", "06:04", "anybody wanted to see they'd be paid for", "06:06", "it right and I kept talking about the", "06:08", "the quantity has a quality all its own", "06:10", "idea right where you say listen if only", "06:12", "1% of this stuff is worth watching", "06:14", "you're still gonna have millions of", "06:16", "pieces of content uploaded all the time", "06:18", "there's gonna be good stuff in there", "06:19", "they were like you so you thought this", "06:21", "was coming it's in some ways well yeah", "06:24", "and it wasn't just because um you know I", "06:26", "was in with a bunch of tech people who", "06:28", "understood this too but one of them had", "06:29", "taken me off the radio and and said", "06:31", "we're gonna put you on the Internet this", "06:32", "was in 94 what and I said put me on the", "06:36", "Internet I said we're just learning how", "06:37", "to", "06:38", "I said what are we gonna do and just", "06:39", "well I'm gonna invent the the way to do", "06:42", "this and you're gonna be the test person", "06:44", "right that shows everybody hey you", "06:46", "so that fell through but once that", "06:47", "happened I was you know it was in the", "06:49", "back of my head going okay someday we", "06:50", "might be able to do this on the internet", "06:52", "that kind of things but but the point", "06:54", "was is that these people do venture", "06:55", "capital meetings all these you know", "06:56", "hardcore guys who are inventing our", "06:58", "future and funding it none of them saw", "07:00", "this amateur content then coming there", "07:01", "was one thing that they were doing quite", "07:03", "a long time ago there was like some", "07:05", "internet radio channel yes they had", "07:07", "tried to put together and you know they", "07:09", "had funded it and spent a bunch of money", "07:11", "on they hired a bunch of people to do it", "07:13", "and Bobby Slayton was actually one of", "07:15", "the

"07:31", "of what we do and what the precursors", "07:32", "were and I guess there were audio blogs", "07:34", "and stuff that some really high tech", "07:36", "types were were pursuing in the 90s also", "07:39", "maybe even the late 80s where you know", "07:41", "they're like send in full files to each", "07:43", "other or something but you know it's", "07:44", "funny because somebody's gonna write a", "07:46", "book someday about the history of this", "07:47", "and how it got started and all that kind", "07:49", "of stuff and it's crazy to think about", "07:51", "that we're actually due

there's", "39:27", "a part of me that thinks that there must", "39:29", "be something deeply embedded in the DNA", "39:33", "or our code or whatever that that", "39:36", "because it's either that or
