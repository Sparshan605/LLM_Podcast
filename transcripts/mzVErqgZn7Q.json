you eliminate you know", "12:29", "when you eliminate the the likely", "12:32", "scenarios then the unlikely is what", "12:36", "you're left with and in this case we had", "12:38", "we were in the

"13:35", "even there yeah me too well at that but", "13:38", "by that time with yeah there were", "13:40", "moments we'd been in the woods already", "13:42", "for over four weeks and so we had kind", "13:46", "of gotten to the point you know you have", "13:48", "to sort of steel yourself against that", "13:50", "natural fear reaction to those", "13:52", "circumstances but I think this is a", "13:55", "something that a lot of Bigfoot hunters", "13:58", "assume which is that Bigfoot is sweet or", "14:01", "Bigfoot's this harmless being that's out", "14:04", "there picking flowers and

"30:31", "go to the beach right now you could go", "30:33", "and lay out and people would think he", "30:35", "had great feet well again the the", "30:38", "conditions of that particular footprint", "30:40", "were just really quite remarkable making", "30:42", "a very clear imprint but you know there", "30:45", "it's it's indicated that the the sole", "30:47", "pad is probably pretty substantial

you", "31:06", "can dissect it and criticize it and and", "31:08", "pick it apart and question it but when", "31:11", "then you see you know as you point out", "31:13", "repeated appearances not only

well", "41:17", "definitely well be in the sense that", "41:20", "non-primate mammals fur bearing mammals", "41:23", "of North America have have fur rather", "41:25", "than simply hair that means they

difficult to get DNA because", "42:40", "there's you know the way hair is", "42:41", "constructed that you have a cuticle and", "42:43", "then you have a layer called the cortex", "42:46", "and then a central core and in if that", "42:50", "core or medulla has cells stacked up in", "42:54", "it then that's usually where the DNA is", "42:57", "extracted from in animals that don't", "42:59", "have a

no evidence you know that one", "43:23", "way or the other so it's basically", "43:25", "you've got this hair that hasn't been", "43:27", "identified but you know identifying", "43:29", "hairs kind of more art than science", "43:31", "because even on our bodies we have hair", "43:34", "that differs in appearance head hair", "43:36", "beard hair eyelashes more iers exactly", "43:39", "pure q how to

sir", "44:51", "so the world got a little lighter as", "44:54", "Bill Hicks would say we lost some more", "44:57", "on the this this phenomenon for whatever", "45:01", "reason is well I guess it's a bunch of", "45:03", "reasons why people would want to hoax it", "45:05", "first of all notoriety second of all", "45:07", "because it's fun and third of all", "45:08", "because it's so similar to us

have these long", "46:03", "form three-hour conversations I don't", "46:05", "remember who I said what with or when", "46:07", "and I confuse stories sure and you know", "46:10", "what also and I don't know if there's", "46:12", "any statistics for it but I heard that", "46:14", "there's a statistic that 40% of the", "46:17", "people at Disneyland or on ecstasy at", "46:19", "any given time I heard that's like a", "46:21", "statistic like the number of people on", "46:23", "psychedelics they're in the same way in", "46:25", "the forest it's funny she does Oh many", "46:28", "people camping or hi what's the", "46:30", "percentage because I", "46:31", "think it's 90% of the people who go", "46:33", "camping or hi and I don't think that", "46:35", "this discounts the fact that there's", "46:37", "Bigfoot but I would say that most of the", "46:40", "people who see Bigfoot if they're out in", "46:42", "the woods they're probably stoned on top", "46:44", "of it it's possible that they are but I", "46:46", "think another issue is that you may only", "46:49", "be able to contact Bigfoot when you're", "46:51", "high", "46:52", "I maybe that's it maybe it's that", "46:55", "because of

I'm like that's", "53:20", "ridiculous that's a kind of monkey suit", "53:27", "okay we'll get to that we'll go to that", "53:29", "um but the this this film have you ever", "53:32", "looked at it and thought it was fake hmm", "53:34", "never well I mean I've questioned", "53:37", "whether it was authentic or not but I", "53:38", "never come to a conclusion that it must", "53:41", "have been faked it's the holy grail of", "53:42", "Bigfoot footage well yeah but that's not", "53:45", "that's not the reason I that the Nam", "53:48", "night but it yes oh sure it has set the", "53:51", "bar I guess that's why I would rather", "53:53", "look at it that it sets the bar as high", "53:56", "as as it is for photographic evidence", "53:58", "and anything that falls short of it", "54:00", "since we're

dozens and dozens hundreds of", "54:10", "footprints that fill my lab that that", "54:12", "form the basis of my conclusion but I", "54:15", "would think it would just be devastating", "54:16", "just because people be of so upset they", "54:18", "were claiming that it wasn't real oh it", "54:20", "was real sure that would be ego wise", "54:22", "that will be crusher especially to such", "54:24",

one", "61:56", "about the head movement thing I wouldn't", "61:58", "know that this was some kind of", "62:00", "primordial thing so these people seem to", "62:03", "have deeply studied it to make something", "62:06", "seem so fake or it just walked straight", "62:09", "and they filmed it all blurry and then", "62:11", "we add all these things to her well yeah", "62:13", "there's why is it

several possibilities", "62:36", "just just give you an apologetic okay", "62:38", "first one is it's bullshit right first", "62:40", "one looks here just bullshit but the", "62:42", "other is that

"63:19", "higher elevation one explanations that's", "63:21", "been offered is that it was now remember", "63:23", "I said that a month earlier there were", "63:25", "actually three sets of tracks possibly", "63:27", "two juveniles those aren't obvious here", "63:30", "in in this footage and like I said I'm", "63:33", "quite convinced that her tracks match", "63:34", "those of the other 15 inch
