covered", "23:41", "with frost but I mean it night it was", "23:43", "freezing you know I mean it was like 32", "23:46", "degrees we were used to we thought we", "23:48", "were gonna be hunting in 90 to 100", "23:50", "degree weather so yeah it didn't you", "23:52", "know when you're laying in a sleeping", "23:53", "bag that's only rated to 40 degrees in", "23:55", "his 32 and sleeping on the ground it's", "23:57", "that's rough it's rough you're saying", "24:01", "that those deer were like super turned", "24:03", "on to or like they were tuned in like", "24:05", "yeah they were very strong edge they", "24:07", "they've been hunted", "24:09", "and you know they don't have liens like", "24:11", "we have here that which keep the deer on", "24:13", "edge you know because we have the

antelope but I I'm not", "24:40", "sure once I said it I'm like are they so", "24:44", "don't don't quote me on that we might", "24:46", "have to look that one up too but all I", "24:47", "know is the reason why I said that is", "24:49", "because they can see I mean antelope or", "24:51", "notorious for having an amazing vision", "24:53", "you know ten times what what humans have", "24:55", "apparently and that's how these were I", "24:58", "mean I don't know if the deer antelope", "25:00", "or whatever but they can see extremely", "25:02", "well so they were seeing you from like a", "25:04", "long ways out oh you couldn't I mean I", "25:06", "hope there's this one buck out of stock", "25:08", "and I had a cameraman with me and that", "25:11", "the key for stalking animals is always", "25:15", "staying in the shade if if you stay in", "25:18", "the shade and you got camo on especially", "25:20", "if they're in the Sun you know how it is", "25:22", "looking looking into if you're in the", "25:24", "Sun you try to look into a house you", "25:25", "can't see right so it's the same thing", "25:27", "with shadow so you always want me shadow", "25:29", "well we were 330 yards away from this", "25:32", "buck I was stocking he was feeding in", "25:34", "his creek and we had this small patch of", "25:37", "sunlight to cross three or thirty yards", "25:39", "away it's a long way away and I told the", "25:42", "cameraman I'm Mike we just got to get", "25:44", "across here just stay low and get you", "25:47", "know hustle through there so we could we", "25:50", "hunched over and got in seconds we were", "25:53", "through there got to the shade looked", "25:55", "over at the buck he stand there staring", "25:57", "I'm like are you kidding me", "25:58", "ha he's already so we're in the shade so", "26:02", "then for sure we weren't moving I'm like", "26:04", "don't move and he's just staring staring", "26:07", "staring staring and I'm like don't move", "26:09", "he's like I'm not I don't don't move", "26:12", "he's he's on he's just looking anything", "26:14", "is going to spook him he's like I'm not", "26:16", "moving and he was crouched down on his", "26:18", "knees and so finally the buck like", "26:22", "took a few bites of grass and I'm like", "26:27", "okay he's feeding next thing gone so all", "26:31", "he did he's took a couple bites of grass", "26:32", "for the road he's like no I already know", "26:35", "I'm out of here", "26:36", "but I'm taking this with me and he was", "26:37", "gone that was it", "26:39", "yeah there's smoke that's long rifle", "26:41", "range we had bows and it's just a barely", "26:43", "this so and we have to get close with a", "26:47", "bow and so you could imagine it just if", "26:49", "that that one example tells you what it", "26:51", "was like basically so we were talking", "26:54", "about different bow setups like you had", "26:58", "brought two setups he brought one for", "26:59", "deer and you bought one for Buffalo so", "27:02", "for people that don't understand there's", "27:05", "two different ways that you were going", "27:07", "to approach this the Buffalo is a giant", "27:09", "heavy boned animal so yet a real heavy", "27:12", "arrow which is going to go slower", "27:14", "yeah and those hours just too slow for", "27:17", "those deer and the deer would actually", "27:18", "move out of the way before the arrow got", "27:20", "yeah", "27:21", "yeah like matrix it was you know the", "27:26", "thing with penetration with an arrow is", "27:29", "weight the weight of the arrow equates", "27:31", "to more penetration with heavy bone and", "27:34", "you know that we talked about the", "27:35", "buffalo 1,800 to 2,000 pounds so you", "27:38", "need something that hits hard well when", "27:41", "you have a heavier arrow it's going to", "27:43", "fly slower so those were flying at 245", "27:45", "feet a second out of my high poundage", "27:47", "bow but I thought well good mouth I mean", "27:51", "I didn't these will be alright I was", "27:53", "shooting it so well I'm so accurate you", "27:55", "know practicing out to 90 yards all the", "27:57", "time shooting really well so I thought", "27:59", "you know what I know it's supposed to be", "28:01", "for Buffalo I'm just going to use it for", "28:02", "deer so the first week there I tried it", "28:04", "for deer and it was just like these deer", "28:07", "were seemingly 10 yards away but having", "28:10", "the arrow got 2 minutes I'm not talking", "28:11", "long shots and I'm like ok maybe there's", "28:14", "just a fluke just a flu so they would", "28:15", "see it hear it they would hear it and", "28:18", "they would duck out of the way or just", "28:20", "be gone I mean just like be 10 yards", "28:22", "away so they would move out of the way", "28:24", "before they all got to them yeah yeah", "28:25", "and so finally I thought well maybe it's", "28:29", "just in a super calm they're so so quiet", "28:33", "you know I don't my bows are quiet a", "28:35", "heavy arrow make", "28:36", "bow even quieter you know it absorbs", "28:38", "that sound and in the energy so your", "28:41", "limbs are just like that there is more", "28:43", "like so but it still makes an always-on", "28:46", "a super calm windless day especially", "28:50", "when it's cold you know I mean it's just", "28:51", "that sounds going to get across there so", "28:53", "I thought well maybe just a fluke maybe", "28:55", "the deer were pick something up pick up", "28:58", "some movement so they were just on me", "29:00", "this is whatever I'm not worried about", "29:02", "it you know I'm not used to missing I'm", "29:04", "used to be very disciplined on my shots", "29:06", "and taking high percentage shots that", "29:10", "relaxed animals if I do do my stock", "29:12", "right my goal is always to shoot an", "29:16", "animal that has no idea I'm there you", "29:19", "know so it's relaxed and so that wasn't", "29:23", "happening here and I thought well maybe", "29:24", "maybe it's just because they're high", "29:26", "strong and they were on me so what would", "29:29", "the the the time where I decided okay", "29:33", "these arrows aren't going to work was a", "29:35", "wild boar was out there big boar 45", "29:39", "yards okay this should be slam-dunk", "29:43", "money and I just cut camera over my", "29:46", "shoulder he had no idea we were there", "29:48", "draw back shoot and he had he was facing", "29:52", "his head to the left and he was heading", "29:55", "back to the right probably a few feet", "29:58", "away but time the arrow got there I mean", "30:00", "well I didn't even have to even I like", "30:02", "shot and went oh are you kidding me", "30:04", "he's that gone that fast spun and just", "30:06", "gone and so that at that time I Mike", "30:09", "okay these this is not gonna work it's", "30:12", "so crazy because although there's no", "30:13", "predators there the hunters that are", "30:16", "there are out there all the time they", "30:18", "don't have a season no there's no season", "30:20", "these animals are just tuned in 100", "30:23", "every day Wow yeah and so and mostly a", "30:26", "rifle so I mean they're used to if they", "30:29", "see somebody that's like a danger", "30:32", "because they've been shot out from you", "30:34", "know hundreds of yards so it's just yeah", "30:38", "it was it was challenging but so I", "30:40", "changed from those 245 grain arrows and", "30:45", "I thought well I need to shoot my not", "30:47", "245 245 feet", "30:50", "get that 687 Green Arrow to a lighter", "30:52", "arrow and I thought well maybe this will", "30:54", "do it yeah you know is shooting 300 feet", "30:58", "per second at that time did you change", "30:59", "broadheads yep did you go to the trocar", "31:02", "no do you step with the solids no I shot", "31:06", "with a buffalo and actually you know", "31:09", "it's funny actually what I ended up", "31:11", "killing the deer with too was uh what", "31:15", "were the Magnus stingers and I also that", "31:18", "but they expand I had that expandable", "31:21", "head you remember that one that I used", "31:22", "on the bear yeah it was a grave digger", "31:25", "grave digger yeah yeah that ruthless", "31:28", "name that head and that that head flies", "31:30", "so good oh his money so use that as well", "31:34", "yep so when you're out there man like so", "31:38", "you're around Sydney which is where", "31:40", "people are there's there's those animals", "31:43", "are hunted pretty pretty regularly yeah", "31:45", "then you're taking that flight for four", "31:47", "and a half hours and then the helicopter", "31:48", "and when you're in the area where the", "31:51", "Buffalo are there's nobody I know it's", "31:54", "remote that is a wild wild place yeah", "31:57", "when you think about the the size of", "32:00", "Australia the size of North America with", "32:01", "the same amount of people as Los Angeles", "32:04", "but the area where you're at is that", "32:05", "that is as wild as it gets", "32:08", "yeah I mean would you fly those foreign", "32:10", "half-hour from Sydney to Darwin and most", "32:13", "that there you're looking down at", "32:14", "country with nothing nothing no roads no", "32:18", "nothing and that's that's a large", "32:22", "majority of Australia's like that and", "32:24", "it's just overrun with Buffalo yeah a", "32:27", "lot of it is yeah and uh what's a crazy", "32:30", "place yeah and we did find some you know", "32:35", "some drawings up there too from that", "32:38", "from yeah I mean all the natives yeah", "32:41", "yeah for the Aborigines and did you did", "32:44", "you know that those were there before", "32:46", "you went there today I know there was an", "32:47", "island new the pilot now yeah so we", "32:49", "wanted to go see him oh wow so are they", "32:52", "in a cave like where they're on the for", "32:56", "the weather not to get to them has to be", "32:57", "on like the underside of a rock so where", "33:00", "we went we filmed under there's like you", "33:02", "could imagine", "33:03", "people getting out of the rain there and", "33:05", "their huge boulders and they're getting", "33:09", "and is just a perfect spot to stay dry", "33:11", "and so that's if the rain was if they", "33:14", "drew on a part of the rock where the", "33:16", "rain was hitting obviously was gone but", "33:18", "in these these areas they were protected", "33:20", "so that drawings were still there last", "33:22", "time Adam was here he talked about some", "33:24", "of the Aborigines there and explained", "33:26", "some stuff but when we went back to my", "33:28", "house we we had dinner and we sat around", "33:31", "talking he told me some crazy stories at", "33:34", "the the horrors that those people faced", "33:36", "and how they had been wiped out like", "33:38", "them been poisoned like he went to this", "33:40", "one cave and he found bones all through", "33:43", "this cave he's like this is crazy", "33:44", "there's like human bones", "33:46", "he's like children's bones you find", "33:48", "children's bones and then he had heard", "33:51", "this story from one of the other", "33:52", "Aborigines that lived there that someone", "33:55", "had brought food to all these people all", "33:57", "the NAB originals air and just poisoned", "33:59", "the food and just killed them all off", "34:01", "yeah it's it's fucking dark yeah yeah", "34:04", "dark now I don't know so they don't know", "34:07", "that they don't know who made those", "34:09", "hieroglyphs or they or the cave drawings", "34:12", "or whatever they were or when they did", "34:14", "it either", "34:14", "now now they say I put it up on my", "34:18", "Instagram page and I saw some comments", "34:20", "there and they're saying that the more", "34:22", "brightly colored the older they are huh", "34:26", "but I don't know I think I think the", "34:29", "pilot mentioned 10,000 years old maybe I", "34:32", "just guess unless you know I have no", "34:34", "idea

with you involved more", "42:25", "people care about it right and we want", "42:28", "to have you involved because we like", "42:30", "hanging out with you and like well I was", "42:32", "explaining this to Adam too when we did", "42:35", "my podcast up there in the bush it's", "42:37", "like ever since I've hunted way back", "42:41", "when Roy moved to Alaska and I was left", "42:44", "hunting

"this awesome and I kept taking people", "42:56", "there and trying to convince him how", "42:58", "awesome it was it wasn't awesome for him", "43:01", "so it was like but you want to share", "43:04", "something that impacts you so much with", "43:07", "other people who appreciate it so that's", "43:09", "why that's what that's what I was saying", "43:12", "when Adam I were talking is that you", "43:16", "know you love bow hunting and so that's", "43:18", "when you are so interested and invested", "43:20", "in something have such a passion for", "43:22", "something there's nothing better when", "43:23", "someone somebody else shares that", "43:25", "passion right yeah so that that was that", "43:28", "was why there's a few different reasons", "43:30", "why you could be involved thank you I'm", "43:33", "excited about that but I also think the", "43:35", "difficulty factor is what turns people", "43:37", "off I don't think they exactly to be so", "43:39", "difficult no no you try to introduce bow", "43:42", "hunting to people first of all just", "43:44", "shooting a bow people think oh let's you", "43:46", "pull the string back you point at the", "43:48", "spot you let it go good luck with all", "43:50", "that it takes fucking years yeah takes", "43:52", "years to get confident with well and I", "43:54", "remember when you first started showing", "43:58", "me how to shoot when first shot in my", "44:00", "backyard and", "44:02", "I immediately recognized I think like", "44:05", "after first of all you had a 90 pound", "44:07", "bow which I definitely shouldn't have", "44:08", "been pulling back my shoulder was", "44:10", "fucking killing me after the first ah", "44:12", "like this takes you got a build up to", "44:15", "this goddamn yeah but then I remember", "44:17", "thinking like to be accurate with this I", "44:20", "just went down a rabbit hole yeah oh my", "44:22", "god just took my first step down a crazy", "44:25", "rabbit hole and who knows where it leads", "44:26", "because this is not easy", "44:28", "no and I'm I have a very addictive", "44:30", "personality yeah and I need to figure", "44:33", "out ways to channel that addiction in", "44:36", "positive ways because I can get lost", "44:38", "doing things that are not good so bow", "44:41", "hunting and archery itself to me it", "44:44", "seemed like okay this is a discipline", "44:46", "it's a worthy pursuit it's fascinating", "44:48", "and I'm very very interested in it yeah", "44:50", "but for a lot of people I think it's", "44:52", "very daunting like oh I don't think they", "44:55", "realize it people think of hunting as", "44:57", "like Elmer Fudd like you know you go out", "45:00", "there or they see some hunting scene in", "45:03", "a movie where there's a bunch of", "45:04", "rednecks and they're fat and they're", "45:05", "sitting in a tree stand or something", "45:07", "like that and they think it's easy they", "45:09", "think it's a bunch of people that are", "45:10", "just killing animals and they don't care", "45:12", "and then when you actually go out and do", "45:15", "it especially we go do it with a person", "45:17", "like you you understand what this thing", "45:19", "really is and what it really is is this", "45:21", "incredibly difficult pursuit that takes", "45:24", "immense amounts of hard work and", "45:26", "dedication and you got to be in fucking", "45:29", "shape for it yeah and this is something", "45:32", "that people are starting to realize now", "45:33", "right oh and I think you're a big part", "45:35", "of this and over the last few years and", "45:37", "all the platforms that you've gone on to", "45:39", "tell your story as if people understand", "45:42", "that big-game hunting in the West and", "45:45", "the western style hunting elk and mule", "45:48", "deer the type of stuff that you love to", "45:49", "do is very very difficult it is a", "45:53", "combination of athletics of extreme", "45:56", "endurance of hiking outdoorsmen ship", "46:00", "survival skills and then the knowledge", "46:03", "of hunting and then you have to be a", "46:05", "good shot on top of all that you have to", "46:07", "know archery yeah then you have to be", "46:08", "able to keep you know with that", "46:09", "adrenaline hits yeah all of a sudden and", "46:12", "that's what's hard is people have", "46:14", "invested so much into it", "46:16", "they've been thinking about the the", "46:17", "moment the crunch time for so long that", "46:20", "when it happens it's too much yeah so", "46:23", "it's really hard when you've been", "46:26", "thinking about something for years", "46:27", "potentially or at least all year you", "46:30", "know that oh here's my chance here's my", "46:32", "chance and then you get it and you're", "46:33", "not ready yeah because it's just too", "46:35", "much - it's so hard to stay calm", "46:38", "well it's also something that you need", "46:39", "to do a bunch of times until you", "46:41", "understand it yeah it's like I try to", "46:43", "explain to people about we were talking", "46:45", "about fighting earlier we're talking", "46:47", "about when Pete if someone has never", "46:50", "fought before and never competed before", "46:52", "the the scary thing is not really the", "46:56", "what's nerve-racking is not the actual", "46:58", "fighting itself yeah once the fighting", "47:00", "starts you're actually kind of like just", "47:03", "in the zone and you're just doing it I", "47:05", "mean you might be intimidated especially", "47:06", "you're fighting a guy like Mike Tyson or", "47:08", "Anderson so or something like that", "47:09", "you're gonna be shitting your pants yeah", "47:11", "but the real terrifying stuff is the", "47:13", "build-up the lead-up and that's kind of", "47:16", "the same thing with hunting it's the", "47:18", "moment before the shot yeah it's your", "47:21", "adrenaline is pumping it's like if you", "47:24", "had a shoot an eight ball across the", "47:26", "table long shot and your life was on the", "47:28", "line it's almost like that and you don't", "47:30", "get any warm-up shots", "47:32", "yeah it's no warm-up shots just all of a", "47:34", "sudden here's is one shot all the", "47:36", "marbles and you gotta stay calm oh and", "47:38", "the animal might be moving yeah my god", "47:40", "well fuck no it's I was saying that on", "47:43", "this last hunt it was you know we had me", "47:46", "Adam and Remmy Warren and supposedly", "47:50", "we're supposed to be pretty good huh the", "47:52", "best of the best and we were struggling", "47:55", "to get something killed and I was just", "47:57", "like imagine how frustrating this would", "48:00", "be for somebody a new hunter I mean yeah", "48:03", "it's no wonder people try to bow hunt", "48:05", "and then just be like are you kidding me", "48:07", "this is impossible and it's but it's", "48:10", "it's that challenge", "48:12", "anyway it's that whole journey which is", "48:14", "why I want to do that special yeah and I", "48:17", "wanted I want to share all that's", "48:19", "positive about hunting it to as many", "48:21", "people's you know and we are reaching", "48:23", "new people these days you know I mean", "48:25", "hunting it's it's in the crosshairs and", "48:27", "some", "48:28", "aspects I guess but we're also other", "48:31", "people are getting because I get I mean", "48:33", "III went to an archery shop up there", "48:36", "Benson's archery in Sydney and we just", "48:41", "had a few hours know to say hey Adam", "48:43", "Adam I are going to stop by swing by and", "48:46", "quite a few people came I mean it was it", "48:48", "was surprising how many people showed up", "48:50", "but a lot of them were vegetarians you", "48:53", "know six months ago listen to your show", "48:56", "a lot of people told me oh I found out", "48:58", "about you from Joe Rogan or I didn't", "49:01", "hunt alright I didn't even eat meat and", "49:03", "all these different stories all these", "49:05", "different from all these different areas", "49:07", "so we are reaching new people you know I", "49:09", "want to make sure our message the one of", "49:12", "respect and reverence and an", "49:15", "appreciation for everything out there", "49:17", "and for survival and for just you know", "49:20", "outside of the life outside of the city", "49:22", "I want that shown in a way that I know", "49:25", "we would you know that's why I'm", "49:28", "selfishly want this to be a big thing", "49:31", "just because I'm sick of hunting you", "49:33", "know the Elmer Fudd thing you know I see", "49:37", "I was watching a movie the other day and", "49:39", "they showed a hunter and is like

misrepresented discipline I think", "50:25", "that we have here in America it's it's", "50:28", "so confusing to people because when we", "50:32", "think of food we think of restaurants", "50:35", "and we think a supermarket yeah we don't", "50:36", "think of wild animals and the connection", "50:40", "that people", "50:42", "feel like they don't have with their", "50:43", "food is one thing that comes up all the", "50:45", "time lately so people are constantly", "50:47", "looking for these farm-to-table places", "50:50", "yeah I guess a farm-to-table place out", "50:52", "here called a

or from a farm that they", "51:03", "have a connection to and they buy the", "51:04", "meat from the farm and there's a lot of", "51:06", "that these farm-to-table places where", "51:08", "they these restaurants have a great", "51:11", "relationship with the people that", "51:12", "actually grow the food so everything's", "51:14", "organic they know where it comes from", "51:15", "yeah and people are super connected to", "51:17", "that they love the idea that because", "51:19", "factory farming is kind of freaking", "51:21", "people out yeah and for the longest time", "51:23", "it was happening without us knowing you", "51:26", "know I think during the 80s and the 90s", "51:28", "it was all going on and no one no one", "51:30", "understood yeah so now people are", "51:32", "becoming more aware because of the", "51:34", "internet because of information and", "51:36", "they're becoming more aware of where", "51:38", "their food comes from and you're also", "51:40", "seeing a higher number of people that", "51:42", "their response to this factory farming", "51:45", "thing is well hey I'll go vegetarian or", "51:48", "hey I'll go vegan and before I hunted", "51:50", "with Rinella that was my thought I was", "51:52", "like I don't want to participate in", "51:54", "factory farming yeah so what am I gonna", "51:56", "do I'm gonna do one of two things I'm",

pretty one-sided as far as", "86:29", "they won't accept being a hunter and", "86:31", "being self-sufficient well at any hunter", "86:35", "I know isn't going on vegan pages and", "86:38", "talking shit you know I mean I mean so", "86:40", "it's it's just weird how they're so", "86:43", "hateful and so one side you know up on", "86:47", "our soapbox you know and I don't feel", "86:48", "like we

about what we're talking about", "87:42", "earlier that we were saying that people", "87:44", "sort of find their area and it becomes", "87:47", "like an echo chamber yeah and I think", "87:48", "that's one of the issues with with", "87:50", "whether it's veganism or even hunting is", "87:52", "that I think that people they need to be", "87:55", "that have these dialogues with people", "87:58", "that don't necessarily agree with that", "87:59", "right so they can find out how the other", "88:01", "person thinks yeah", "88:03", "and you know if you do if you are", "88:05", "talking

"88:47", "they care about life and because they", "88:49", "want to be cruelty-free and they want to", "88:52", "live life with his little footprint as", "88:53", "possible yeah I think they'd be",

hunting is", "89:36", "that yeah if it goes away and if it", "89:38", "there was a trend about 10 maybe 15 20", "89:42", "years ago where from what I've read at", "89:44", "least obviously I'm pretty new to it I", "89:46", "only been hunting for five years but", "89:47", "that they were considerably worried", "89:50", "there they were really worried there was", "89:52", "a real thought that the next few", "89:54", "generations that hunting was going to", "89:56", "dwindle down to such a such a low number", "89:59", "that the hunters would not have the same", "90:02", "sort of impact in in

was I liked the fact that", "94:20", "he at least took time out to talk about", "94:23", "it you know instead of just I'm not sure", "94:26", "why he did but I appreciated the fact", "94:27", "that he did", "94:28", "well it's he's an interesting guy", "94:30", "because he saves money for the people by", "94:33", "sleeping in his office he has a cot in", "94:36", "his office that he sleeps in to save", "94:38", "money on hotel rooms for the people so", "94:40", "it's like yeah it's not like he's a", "94:42", "total piece of shit no you know he I", "94:44", "didn't get that feeling but Rinella

of these", "94:57", "decisions right these decisions are they", "95:00", "are a step in the wrong direction that", "95:03", "will snowball out of control and will", "95:05", "eventually lead to privatization of", "95:07", "public lands and the loss of the access", "95:09", "to them by the American people that you", "95:11", "know was all set aside by Teddy", "95:12", "Roosevelt and all those people that had", "95:14", "such great insight foresight back in the", "95:16", "day yeah", "95:17", "and that's you know that was the worry", "95:19", "with he says well no I'm just taking a", "95:21", "law enforcement away from these lands", "95:24", "and get or not taking it away but giving", "95:26", "it to the state and like I said with the", "95:28", "whole budget saying so people were", "95:30", "thinking that when they don't have", "95:31", "enough money not just for the law", "95:33", "enforcement but for enforcing illegal", "95:38", "timber harvest right and dumping trash", "95:40", "right and so when all that happens that", "95:43", "that lessens the value of the land so", "95:46", "when the value of the land is lessened", "95:48", "then it's just like okay whatever this", "95:49", "is a garbage dump anyway right so it", "95:53", "makes it easier so they thought that was", "95:55", "just a step in the transition of moving", "95:57", "taking that away from public land and", "96:00", "privatizing it so that's right now as", "96:02", "opinion and maybe it was I don't know", "96:03", "but he seemed like Jason seemed like a", "96:05", "very nice guy when you were interviewing", "96:07", "them we don't know enough about that", "96:09", "particular issue but when you talk to", "96:11", "God like brunella who is simply invested", "96:13", "in a very well read on
