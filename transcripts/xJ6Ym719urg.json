surprisingly durable so thing", "00:11", "about these mushroom hats there that you", "00:13", "would think oh it's gonna fall apart in", "00:14", "your fingers but no it's got like it's", "00:16",

mushroom really and", "00:28", "this were actually revolutionized", "00:29", "warfare because it helped Flynn spark", "00:32", "guns ignite the gunpowder really so on", "00:35", "samba do and it comes from a birch", "00:38", "polypore mushroom which is a subject of", "00:40", "much of our research these days now when", "00:42", "this grows in the wild what does it look", "00:45", "like because this is you've fashioned it", "00:48", "into this hat well I had someone fashion", "00:50", "some ladies it looks like yeah some", "00:52", "ladies in Transylvania yeah yeah it's", "00:54", "called foamies women Terios it allowed", "00:57", "for the portability of fire there's no", "00:59", "doubt we all came from africa we went", "01:01", "north and we discovered winter this loud", "01:03", "for fire

people to survive Wow it's very", "01:14", "light is it edible excellent question", "01:19", "Hippocrates first described it in 400", "01:22", "BCE as a tree as an anti-inflammatory so", "01:26", "in teas yes but you know that's very", "01:28", "very tough when you put it in ash and", "01:31", "water it delaminates", "01:32", "into mycelium and so some ladies in", "01:34", "transylvania still make these and as a", "01:37", "fabric that you pull and that mushroom", "01:39", "there will become one hat or maybe more", "01:43", "because it just keeps on the elongated", "01:45", "and it's made of mycelium and so", "01:47", "explaining the process how would you", "01:49", "take this slab of mushroom that i have", "01:51", "that looks like sort of like an enormous", "01:52", "Hershey's kiss and then you would put", "01:55", "that in water with ash from a fire from", "01:58", "a fire and what I asked was that highly", "02:01", "alkaline and then it helps it separate", "02:04", "it begins to delaminate and literally", "02:06", "you start pulling us and it's a fabric", "02:08", "that you keep on", "02:10", "ah and so it's called German Felton it's", "02:13", "been used for literally thousands of", "02:15", "years and beekeepers actually use this", "02:17", "for smoking hives it we could but it", "02:21", "would be kind of it would be kind of", "02:23", "bizarre we could let's flick a bit and", "02:26", "you'd burn up one of these things here", "02:29", "is that it's just amazing how much this", "02:33", "is a fuse and one spark on this you know", "02:37", "can ignite this entire thing over 15 20", "02:40", "minutes really yeah", "02:41", "and so beekeepers use it for smoke so if", "02:43", "I lit this right now with this lighter", "02:44", "not that the the powder was so you this", "02:49", "the ash the powder powder - and then the", "02:52", "water and then how does it flatten out", "02:55", "and become with it because it soaks up", "02:57", "and mycelium makes mushrooms mushrooms", "03:00", "make mycelium and so when you soak this", "03:02", "and then it gets soggy and then it", "03:05", "tenderizes and then you start breaking", "03:08", "it and pulling it apart this is actually", "03:10", "part we first discovered because our", "03:11", "ancestors notice when insects were born", "03:13", "does much yeah is that the unprocessed", "03:15", "version of it this is so this is what", "03:17", "it's like on one side well it's just", "03:19", "made it into a little toe table thing", "03:20", "but it's the same thing basically", "03:22", "so is this stitched together how do they", "03:24", "make it like this actually using wood a", "03:27", "wood glue and but that's all the natural", "03:29", "colors nothing's been added to it and", "03:32", "these and so they just pull it apart", "03:34", "pull it apart and again flat yeah I", "03:36", "really want to make a coat I'm reading", "03:38", "this my goal is that have somebody make", "03:39", "a coat would it tear easily it's an", "03:42", "amazingly strong tensile fabric", "03:44", "it's mmm it absorbs water but you have", "03:49", "to be careful someone smoking a joint or", "03:51", "near a fire or

asked me not to", "12:35", "use her name and they asked how many do", "12:37", "we need I said about 10 billion the", "12:39", "billion billion and because this but I", "12:44", "will do up to my capacity and then I'm", "12:47", "hoping that you know we're gonna give", "12:50", "these away for free and then eventually", "12:52", "we'll create networks of hubs where I", "12:55", "have now 40

code for 3d printers so", "13:33", "that's really important for schools so", "13:35", "what the codes gonna be open sourced but", "13:38", "it then if somebody want to make", "13:39", "millions of these and sell them of", "13:41", "course you know I wouldn't be happy", "13:42", "without they have to work with me but", "13:44", "individually we can empower individuals", "13:45", "within schools
