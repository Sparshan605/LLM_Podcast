["00:00", "four three two one okay so I'm on my way", "00:07", "over here and I'm listening to this new", "00:09", "radio that podcast and they're talking", "00:11", "about this new technology that's", "00:12", "available I'm like this is the perfect", "00:14", "thing to be listening to right when I'm", "00:16", "coming to hang out with Eddie Bravo", "00:18", "oh no there's a website called future of", "00:20", "fake news.com where they show this new", "00:22", "technology on display well you know how", "00:24", "Adobe does Photoshop and so they can", "00:26", "they can adjust images if they can take", "00:29", "20 to 40 minutes to want to do it with", "00:31", "20 they prefer to do it with 40 40", "00:33", "minutes of recorded audio of you talking", "00:35", "then they run it through this machine", "00:37", "and they can have you say words you've", "00:38", "never said they can have you make sounds", "00:41", "that you've never made and those in", "00:43", "those those sentences that's so like you", "00:46", "can have a sense yeah like you can have", "00:48", "a sentence that says like hey Joe", "00:51", "you want to get something to eat after", "00:52", "the podcast and they can intersect hey", "00:55", "Joe I got a bunch of transgender hookers", "00:58", "and some heroin you want to get", "01:00", "something to eat and go hang out with", "01:01", "them after the podcast and it would", "01:03", "sound exactly like what you said it'll", "01:07", "sound exactly like your own word but I'm", "01:09", "sure there's gonna be experts that can", "01:10", "analyze it and go this is a this is a", "01:12", "fraud for now yeah what they're", "01:14", "essentially saying is this is the", "01:16", "infancy of it have to get like experts", "01:18", "to analyze the audio you can see it", "01:19", "right there", "01:20", "they synthesized Barack Obama's audio", "01:24", "and they have him say things they'd", "01:25", "never said they they have him in George", "01:26", "Bush going back and forth telling jokes", "01:29", "to each other that they never told dude", "01:30", "I can we hear this yeah yeah yes you", "01:33", "know can we think you're talking about", "01:35", "yeah okay see if you can find that it", "01:38", "might be on their website it doesn't", "01:41", "sound good when they're doing that but", "01:43", "it's in its infancy but it sounds like", "01:45", "them talking yeah it just it sounds a", "01:47", "little edited yeah you know it's not", "01:49", "flowing together right but apparently", "01:51", "they're able to break down faces to the", "01:54", "point where say they were saying that", "01:56", "like if Jennifer Aniston goes to China", "01:57", "and she does a commercial for something", "01:59", "what they can do is have Jennifer", "02:02", "answers and talk for a period of time", "02:04", "and they figure out how her her voice", "02:07", "moves and they take all these images of", "02:09", "her face and they can manipulate it so", "02:10", "accurately they can have someone speak", "02:13", "in man", "02:13", "in Chinese where all the different you", "02:15", "know different sounds they make and they", "02:16", "could sync up her lips and her movement", "02:19", "and the movement of her face to what it", "02:21", "would look like if she was making those", "02:23", "actual sounds which is just amazing so", "02:25", "then they can have a voice like a", "02:27", "Mandarin speaking woman who could speak", "02:29", "in Chinese and you would see the exact", "02:32", "correct movements from Jennifer", "02:33", "Aniston's mouth so wouldn't like you", "02:36", "know you watch like a that matter was", "02:38", "made though right but yeah let's here", "02:41", "just let's hear it because our parties", "02:45", "have moved further and further apart and", "02:48", "it's harder and harder to find common", "02:50", "ground so you know when I said in 2004", "02:54", "that there were no red states and blue", "02:57", "states for the United States of America", "02:59", "that was wrong so you could tell by the", "03:03", "lips in that one yeah have you looked at", "03:05", "his lips it looked funk not that good", "03:06", "but but that's just now like what's it", "03:10", "gonna be like in a year what's it gonna", "03:12", "be like in five years and this is this", "03:14", "is what they're saying is that what", "03:15", "we're looking at now is the future of", "03:17", "fake news they're going to be able to", "03:19", "recreate people saying things that they", "03:22", "never said and it's going to be", "03:23", "impossible for you to tell the", "03:24", "difference so how can that be used for", "03:27", "the Illuminati they use it for anybody", "03:30", "that's the problem anybody is a good", "03:33", "innit VC oh now we can do this I don't", "03:36", "know it's hard it's hard to say what", "03:37", "would be good because you never know", "03:39", "what the end result of anything is gonna", "03:41", "be when someone creates some sort of", "03:42", "amount mind-bending world-changing", "03:45", "technology like that it only could be", "03:47", "for bad because it's a lie it's", "03:48", "basically gonna be alive yeah whatever", "03:50", "comes out of their mouth it's gonna be a", "03:52", "lie", "03:52", "so there's no way that could be good", "03:54", "yeah but see what it is is the", "03:56", "consequences of technologists pushing", "03:59", "boundaries so the problem is it's not", "04:02", "their intention is not initially to do", "04:04", "something bad that's one of the", "04:05", "interesting things about the Radio Times", "04:06", "probably hold on because the radio lab", "04:10", "podcast talked to the technologists and", "04:11", "they confronted her with it and it's", "04:13", "very uncomfortable to watch this lady be", "04:15", "confronted with the idea like what if", "04:17", "this is used for evil like whatever it's", "04:19", "used for fake news and you can tell that", "04:21", "they don't they're not even thinking", "04:23", "about that hardly all they're trying to", "04:24", "do is figure out how to do something", "04:26", "that nobody", "04:27", "can do like when someone comes up with a", "04:29", "technology if you can come up with some", "04:31", "sort of a voice manipulating technology", "04:34", "like that or a visual manipulating", "04:36", "technology you're gonna realize there's", "04:38", "a bunch of other people that are", "04:38", "probably closing in on something like", "04:39", "that too and it becomes this mad race to", "04:42", "get something done and to make a shit", "04:44", "ton of money if you have something like", "04:46", "that that could be potentially worth who", "04:48", "knows ungodly sums of money I'm just", "04:51", "trying to figure out a way you could use", "04:52", "that for good to come far away the one", "04:55", "thing that they were saying is you could", "04:57", "take recordings of Einstein there's", "04:59", "hours and hours and hours and hours of", "05:01", "recordings of Einstein you could create", "05:03", "a visual Einstein and you could have a", "05:06", "3d technology perhaps or virtual reality", "05:09", "technology where you're hanging out", "05:10", "having a fucking conversation with", "05:12", "Einstein what and now step one right", "05:19", "step two is some sort of a neural", "05:21", "interface with virtual reality where", "05:23", "instead of just looking at it through", "05:24", "goggles it's it's going into your mind", "05:27", "in some sort of a way it's interfacing", "05:30", "with the very neurons and the very your", "05:32", "visual cortex it's it's showing you", "05:34", "images that you you know you wouldn't", "05:36", "really be seen for sure it would be", "05:38", "great for brainwashing or oh yeah oh for", "05:40", "sure that's a no-brainer that's for sure", "05:42", "go mr. brainwash but say like fake news", "05:45", "like just like you says the thing is no", "05:47", "one gets out alive with this shit so", "05:49", "this is the thing just don't the one", "05:51", "thing that might be fascinating about it", "05:52", "is there's gonna be no control like", "05:55", "everyone's going to be able to", "05:57", "eventually use something like this and", "05:59", "they said that it would tip require like", "06:00", "painstaking step-by-step a person going", "06:05", "over the data to see if they could", "06:07", "figure out what was manipulated and they", "06:08", "think they could find like 75% of the", "06:11", "ones that have been manipulated right", "06:12", "now we find the fake ones but the", "06:15", "problem is like the amount of time that", "06:17", "it takes to do that is astounding crazy", "06:20", "it's an its people-to-people time like", "06:21", "you have you have to be sitting there", "06:23", "like going over it looking at what is", "06:24", "this check that out go back what's this", "06:26", "number right here why is this off what's", "06:28", "going on here okay mark that move on and", "06:30", "they have to like do this over and over", "06:31", "and over again their looks or anomalies", "06:33", "look for some sort of de evidence that", "06:35", "it's been manipulated by a digital", "06:37", "source or by some sort of a digital", "06:39", "control and", "06:40", "or a computer or something like that I", "06:42", "think it'll be easy to tell in the", "06:45", "beginning maybe but I mean how good our", "06:47", "photo shops like the photo shop Steve", "06:48", "how good are some of his photo shops and", "06:50", "this dude is just having fun well how", "06:51", "about that photo shop of I think it's", "06:54", "Neil Armstrong where he's standing on", "06:56", "the moon and it's like there's a shot", "06:58", "there's a shot of him looking down it's", "07:02", "like a selfie and then there's the earth", "07:04", "in the background and they prove that's", "07:06", "a photo a Photoshop already I mean they", "07:08", "could just run it through shit just", "07:09", "basic shit you could see that it was cut", "07:11", "in well there was definitely some", "07:13", "manipulation of photos for press use", "07:15", "it's not just that was not just", "07:17", "speculation 69 well they did it before", "07:19", "that even they did it with the Gemini", "07:21", "space program when we did defending that", "07:23", "picture know what's cool that's real", "07:24", "nobody defends that picture well I don't", "07:27", "know if they do or don't but the", "07:28", "craziest one is Michael Collins because", "07:29", "Michael Collins you can prove it the", "07:31", "Gemini 15 picture they took a test photo", "07:34", "of him like in you know some sort of a", "07:36", "warehouse where they would strap him up", "07:37", "with a harness and they're showing him", "07:39", "how to utilize this equipment and then", "07:41", "they blacked all that shit out and", "07:42", "reversed the image and try to pretend he", "07:44", "was doing a spacewalk you never see and", "07:47", "maybe maybe I mean I've seen so much on", "07:50", "the moon this one's the best one isn't", "07:52", "it's not even the moon it's it's just", "07:54", "Michael Collins but you should see", "07:55", "because it's like wait a minute why the", "07:56", "fuck would they do that", "07:57", "like see the disc on photo this is a", "08:01", "hundred percent this is not speculation", "08:03", "they took a photo of him at a test", "08:06", "facility okay well they would you know", "08:08", "prepare themselves for walking on the", "08:10", "moon the one on the left is them", "08:12", "preparing see you Telly's in a harness", "08:14", "there's there's a bunch of equipment", "08:16", "around and he's hanging onto this thing", "08:18", "and they're pulling them like with this", "08:20", "harness that he's attached to and then", "08:22", "the next one it says it's a spacewalk", "08:24", "it's the same exact image they just", "08:27", "blacked it out they just took all the", "08:29", "stuff that was in the background all the", "08:31", "equipment and all the bullshit that's", "08:32", "kind of a blurry copy see they find a", "08:34", "better copy of it but what they did was", "08:36", "they made a fake photo of a guy in space", "08:39", "that photos not real that's a photo of", "08:42", "him in the test suit and they just", "08:45", "reversed it and blacked out the", "08:46", "background they could get away with", "08:48", "stuff like that back then man", "08:49", "it wasn't that's a better picture of it", "08:51", "there you got to get a", "08:53", "a good representation it's just what", "08:56", "what they did was they call that what", "08:58", "they did was unquestionably deceptive so", "09:01", "the question is how much of that do they", "09:02", "do", "09:02", "oh come on well that's the question the", "09:04", "question is it's even this hard the most", "09:09", "hardcore skeptics now even the most", "09:12", "hardcore skeptics are like yeah I'm on", "09:15", "the fence about that moon thing you know", "09:17", "no one's really no one's really saying", "09:20", "yes we went to the moon now even like", "09:23", "Mick Wes will shut up about that", "09:25", "you know there's Nicky will I don't", "09:26", "think you're right at all I think he", "09:28", "would definitely argue that we went to", "09:29", "the moon well he's getting paid for that", "09:30", "so the man has got to I mean the dude", "09:33", "the dude backs up every official story", "09:36", "yeah but people do that not necessarily", "09:38", "because they're getting paid they do it", "09:39", "because that's the mindset they're in", "09:40", "they're in this mindset like we were", "09:42", "talking about with someone else before", "09:43", "the park side he makes money on his", "09:45", "website sometimes very little money to", "09:47", "be made of well bunking things well it's", "09:49", "not the motivation for doing it when", "09:50", "you're a multi-millionaire from video", "09:52", "games I mean he made a shit tonne of", "09:54", "money from from selling video games he", "09:57", "was like some sort of a programmer in", "09:59", "video games and then he has a good time", "10:02", "debunking things but he has an official", "10:04", "story mentality is what I would call it", "10:06", "where no matter what like there's people", "10:09", "that are objective and these people that", "10:11", "are deep bunkers and he's a deep bunker", "10:13", "and it doesn't necessarily mean he's", "10:15", "wrong about a lot of stuff but it does", "10:17", "mean that he goes into things with the", "10:19", "intention to debunk and the intention to", "10:21", "almost always gravitate towards an", "10:23", "official tourist yeah every single to", "10:28", "Harvey Oswald acted alone yeah that's a", "10:31", "goof come on man that one's goofy he", "10:33", "believes Tower 7 collapsed at freefall", "10:36", "speed because the fires there's a lot of", "10:38", "people who believe that unfortunately", "10:40", "I'm not a fucking engineer I would like", "10:42", "to know know whether or not it's", "10:43", "possible to burn a building so bad", "10:45", "inside that it does collapse like that", "10:46", "it's impossible I don't know if that's", "10:48", "true it's no it's it all you have to do", "10:51", "is talk to engineers and architects I've", "10:53", "talked to them you could you cried", "10:55", "that's there's no there's no architects", "10:58", "that outside of NIST a government agency", "11:03", "there's no architects fighting for", "11:06", "to debunk the tower 7 there's none and", "11:10", "every account that's true it's you I", "11:13", "don't know if you know that there's like", "11:15", "but are these there's got to be some", "11:17", "architects and engineers that don't", "11:18", "think that that building fell because it", "11:20", "was demolished look no well if you", "11:23", "understand how its there's about a", "11:25", "hundred thousand architects and", "11:27", "engineers and the associations like the", "11:29", "American Association of Architects in", "11:31", "here there's about a hundred thousand", "11:32", "and Richard gage he's one of them and he", "11:38", "didn't know anything about he thought it", "11:39", "was a it wasn't an inside job it took", "11:41", "him years and then he didn't really know", "11:44", "about our seven most of them don't know", "11:45", "about power seven what he does now he", "11:48", "discovered it and what he does now is", "11:50", "just go from convention to convention", "11:53", "sitting fifteen architects down at a", "11:55", "time and boom about 99% of them they all", "11:58", "believe it though they didn't even know", "11:59", "there was a third tower it was not in", "12:02", "the media that much they basically think", "12:04", "that's crazy I think by this time", "12:06", "everybody knows about tower selling they", "12:07", "still don't know most people think no", "12:09", "they don't you don't they don't I don't", "12:11", "latter on on the mainstream media people", "12:13", "have talked about it enough online to", "12:15", "the point more than ever but now more", "12:18", "than ever yes they go to hear about that", "12:20", "tower seven thing but they don't really", "12:21", "know the details they just kind of just", "12:22", "know about it you know did you ever see", "12:24", "the video that shows the full collapse", "12:26", "which takes a lot longer you see the it", "12:28", "first collapse it was the top of the", "12:30", "thing falls into the center and that's", "12:32", "the elevations yeah they explain", "12:35", "architects and engineers i've sat with", "12:37", "them I'm no structural engineer but you", "12:38", "tell the comments and say this is what", "12:41", "if someone told you if someone told you", "12:43", "there's 85 columns that hold up tower", "12:46", "seven mm-hmm and if someone told you of", "12:49", "a structural engineer told you would you", "12:50", "think he was crazy or would you believe", "12:52", "him if he said and it makes sense I mean", "12:55", "it's common sense the only way you're", "12:57", "gonna get a building to come down like", "12:59", "that any building any structure is you", "13:02", "have to blow up all 80 comps at the same", "13:04", "time otherwise it won't go down like", "13:06", "that to me that's common sense to", "13:09", "someone who believes this the government", "13:11", "agencies said no that's not true one", "13:13", "column went and then it spiraled out of", "13:15", "control because of fires when you talk", "13:17", "to structural engineers", "13:19", "I've had Richard gage on my podcast", "13:21", "twice every time it comes back he gets", "13:23", "more he just piles on more because all I", "13:25", "gotta do is sit him down they don't know", "13:27", "nobody knows that's the truth see as he", "13:30", "ever debated someone who's like an", "13:32", "opposing viewpoint the Bader structure I", "13:35", "know nobody's back this is what people", "13:37", "would those know because when they look", "13:39", "into it it's common sense", "13:40", "anybody knows you so you think that they", "13:43", "know that it's not true they think they", "13:46", "think that power tower 7 was an inside", "13:48", "job and they don't want to debate it", "13:49", "because they can't win do you really", "13:50", "think they think then I say that again", "13:51", "so you think the people that are", "13:53", "debunking it so like if he's got this", "13:55", "opinion there's no our architects and", "13:57", "engineers debunking it that's already", "13:58", "looked into that that's already been", "14:01", "late that's already been young inside", "14:02", "that's gotta be a Texan engineers just", "14:05", "disagree mm-hmm come on man you don't", "14:08", "think there's any people find a video of", "14:11", "a real government agency Jamie see if", "14:14", "you can but doesn't that make sense", "14:17", "what's of a an engineer told you a", "14:20", "struck a do to build skyscrapers told", "14:23", "you to your face like I've been told to", "14:24", "my face they said the only way that", "14:26", "thing and you see it on video engineer", "14:28", "after engineer after engineer are they", "14:30", "all crazy the engineer engineer after", "14:32", "engineer ago it's impossible when you", "14:34", "look into it it's impossible for a", "14:36", "building to collapse like that unless", "14:38", "all 80 columns are blown up at the same", "14:41", "time we've covered this but here's the", "14:43", "famous I don't know anything about", "14:45", "engineering I don't know if you have", "14:47", "diesel fires that get out of control if", "14:49", "it weakens the entire structure where it", "14:51", "just collapses like that if you have you", "14:55", "have guests all the time there are", "14:56", "experts in fields that you're not", "14:58", "experts in but when you sit here you", "15:00", "find out sometimes they're wrong yes", "15:01", "unfortunately ramble about some stuff", "15:04", "and then they find out that they're", "15:06", "making some of it up or this no but this", "15:10", "but an engineer a guy who builds", "15:13", "understand this is right doesn't it make", "15:15", "sense that make sound Google like try to", "15:18", "figure out like who resists architects", "15:20", "and engineers like what is it I'm", "15:22", "reading right now an article from The", "15:24", "Boston Globe that talks about truthers", "15:25", "in 9/11 and Richard gages talked about I", "15:28", "think they in they might have", "15:31", "interviewed", "15:31", "I'm trying to figure out what this is", "15:33", "what they're talking about there's got", "15:35", "to be some engineers that have had a", "15:38", "conversation or a debate doesn't", "15:41", "possibly have fall in any other way okay", "15:43", "maybe they're out there there's the",

exchanges towards the end", "74:11", "I felt still think the volume of it and", "74:13", "the impact went to Robbie second round", "74:15", "went to cowboy pretty big then Robbie", "74:17", "rallied in the third round and I think", "74:19", "he dominated the third round I think he", "74:21", "hurt cowboy a few times I think that", "74:23", "would have been an amazing five round", "74:24", "fight that would have been an incredible", "74:26", "number who won the fight Robbie one very", "74:28", "close decision I think it was a split", "74:29", "decision I don't all the fire that my", "74:32", "great fire brain is scrambled it was a", "74:34", "great fight it was a great fight both", "74:36", "gave both took it was it was war it was", "74:38", "chaos you know and cowboy definitely", "74:41", "caught him with some clean shots he hit", "74:43", "him some real good nice the body as well", "74:45", "cowboy landed a lot of great shit but", "74:47", "you know Robbie looked like Robbie again", "74:48", "he looked like the Robbie Lawler that", "74:50", "won the title it looked like a killer he", "74:52", "looked like the same spooky dude that", "74:54", "just keeps coming after you until he", "74:55", "puts you away that's what he looked like", "74:57", "in the third round third round in", "74:58", "particular really looked like he was", "74:59", "falling back into the old groove again", "75:01", "so there's him you know I think man it's", "75:05", "crazy seeing Rory MacDonald over in", "75:08", "Bellator looking better than ever", "75:09", "looking better than ever when he took", "75:11", "down Paul Daley like he cracked Paul on", "75:14", "the feet didn't get hit with shit took", "75:16", "Paul down and strangled the shit out of", "75:18", "him and the way he did it you watch did", "75:19", "he go whoa like Rory MacDonald might be", "75:22", "the best welterweight on the planet like", "75:24", "he might he might right be there you", "75:26", "know you got to remember he beat tyron", "75:27", "woodley remember that fight I don't", "75:29", "remember it Rory shut him down shut down", "75:31", "that big overhand right yeah it was", "75:33", "pressed against the case recent long ago", "75:35", "maybe if I had a guess 2015 I think he", "75:39", "fought tyron woodley before he fought", "75:41", "Robbie Lawler I think it was one of", "75:42", "those elimination what Lee was that was", "75:44", "a decision yeah I beat Woodley by", "75:46", "decision and he also beat Demian Maia he", "75:48", "survived being mounted by Danny and mine", "75:49", "in the first round", "75:50", "hmm Damien took him down mounted him he", "75:52", "defended and then he fucked Damien up in", "75:54", "the second and the third round and he's", "75:55", "still peaking dude he's like 26 yeah", "75:58", "he's one of the best in the world", "75:59", "without a doubt he might be the best", "76:01", "without a doubt yeah it bums me out", "76:03", "seeing him over at Bellator I think that", "76:05", "kid is sensational", "76:06", "it's Kelvin coming back down to 170 what", "76:09", "do you think I think you can make it for", "76:12", "sure", "76:12", "I think if Kelvin had the kind of", "76:13", "discipline that Chris Weidman has to get", "76:15", "down to 85 Chris Weidman is a huge guy", "76:17", "yeah he has to have real discipline to", "76:20", "make that 185 pound limit I mean he has", "76:22", "to really watch his calories he walk", "76:24", "around it I would like to know it's well", "76:26", "north of 200 pounds so he's a big guy", "76:28", "you know according to Ray Longo Matt", "76:31", "Serra they like Chris is on the big side", "76:32", "of 85 like he could easily be on the", "76:35", "small side of 205 mm-hmm", "76:37", "you know and then do you what do you", "76:38", "think about these new weight classes", "76:39", "like the athletic commissions now", "76:41", "they're they're gonna add 65 75 95 and I", "76:45", "think 220 it was a 225 to do UFC gonna", "76:48", "do this I don't know well if UFC is", "76:50", "gonna do it but I think they should I", "76:52", "think they should go every ten pounds", "76:53", "not every five pounds but every ten", "76:55", "pounds the way it is", "76:56", "do you know like it just it makes sense", "76:59", "every it makes sense but fighters I", "77:03", "don't think we I don't think we need it", "77:04", "it makes sense I don't mind the big", "77:06", "jumps really find your spot we don't", "77:08", "need more it would just be a it'll just", "77:10", "I don't know at this point I think you", "77:12", "keep it the way it is but who knows what", "77:15", "they're gonna do", "77:15", "I don't agree I think we need more", "77:17", "weight classes I think there's too big", "77:18", "of jumps I think the jump of like 185 to", "77:22", "205 is fuck", "77:23", "crazy that's a 20-pound jump that's huge", "77:25", "the difference between a guy who's 185", "77:28", "and a guy was 205 is significant the", "77:30", "amount of power that guy has over the 85", "77:32", "pounder is fucking huge find your spot", "77:34", "55 it's too many there's too many", "77:36", "tweeners like Diego Sanchez Davis ang is", "77:38", "probably a 65 or you know maybe a little", "77:40", "too small for 70 maybe too big for 55 I", "77:43", "think there's a few of those guys he's", "77:44", "gotten down to 45 I know not good though", "77:46", "I mean not not fought like the Diego", "77:49", "Sanchez of old yeah I can get I think it", "77:51", "was 55 is the spot yeah I think it's", "77:54", "hard for him to even make that though so", "77:56", "you let him fight at 65 he'd have all", "77:57", "his energy it makes sense what you're", "77:59", "saying and I get it totally makes sense", "78:01", "but the fighting it's just fighting you", "78:04", "know it's not diluted we got enough", "78:06", "anymore everything doesn't have to be", "78:08", "like just all systematically fair you", "78:10", "know I don't think that's the case I", "78:11", "don't think we have enough I think we", "78:13", "get a rule for more champions I think", "78:15", "we'd have more super fights could have", "78:16", "more guys rise to the top of the", "78:18", "division and it would be easier to match", "78:19", "them up it's way easier to match up a 75", "78:22", "with an 85 then it is to match up a 70", "78:24", "with an 85 or 55 with an 85 it's just", "78:27", "like too much did the gaps are too big I", "78:29", "think we have too much already I think", "78:31", "it's hard to keep track of shit the way", "78:33", "it is really there's an argument for", "78:36", "that I guess I don't know I like it", "78:38", "though I think it gives people more", "78:39", "options and I think heavyweights for", "78:41", "sure gives them more options I would", "78:43", "also like to see a super heavyweight", "78:45", "division I would like to see a full-on", "78:46", "freakshow I want to see the mountain",
