predict when that's going to happen", "24:18", "so that's like an interesting question", "24:20", "about do we accept the person who I", "24:23", "don't know why I have this it's just", "24:24", "that some", "24:25", "thing in my mind well because you're a", "24:27", "logical person and you're looking at", "24:30", "this Warpaint that people are putting on", "24:33", "and you don't understand the

movie and and that but anyway", "25:06", "we all have these weird quirks the", "25:08", "question is with whom should we be", "25:10", "sympathetic and with whom do we do we", "25:14", "say well you're being judgemental with", "25:16", "me it's women's shoes that have gigantic", "25:19", "heels though stilettos that they could", "25:21", "barely walk in yeah that one freaks me", "25:23",

maybe", "25:34", "I've seen too much physical conflict I", "25:36", "can't imagine wearing something that", "25:37", "would physically compromise me to the", "25:39", "point where I literally can't run away", "25:40", "right cuz you can't run away in those", "25:42", "things if you're in like stilettos like", "25:44", "these little things that you walk around", "25:46", "in and your feet are all

can't reverse it yeah maybe if a lot", "26:24", "of people don't know cowboy boots yeah", "26:26", "the reason why they slip-on like that is", "26:28", "when the horse bucks and takes off your", "26:31", "boots fall off they're supposed to I", "26:34", "didn't know that yeah that's the whole", "26:35", "idea behind them the reason you slip on", "26:37", "and slip off and they have", "26:39",

off", "26:54", "and the fucking horse is gone but at", "26:56", "least you're alive oh that's that", "26:58", "expression he died with his boots on if", "27:00", "you yeah if you hit well not really I", "27:01", "think that's like a gunfight type deal", "27:03", "but I think if you get dry mean if you", "27:04", "drag the horses are gonna run over rocks", "27:06", "and shit you're done people die all the", "27:09", "time that are wearing regular shoes that", "27:11", "shove their feet in the stirrups and", "27:13", "then you're stuck that's why cowboy", "27:15", "boots come off like that yeah

the things that we", "27:36", "claim that we like about heels that is", "27:38", "the you know I do it for height like the", "27:41", "way it makes the leg look probably", "27:45", "secondary to the

clearly not comfortable or for", "28:07", "my benefit in any other way so much so", "28:10", "that you can tell that I must be", "28:12", "interested in sending a signal 100% yeah", "28:14", "so the

not", "28:46", "ridiculous no it's a shared deception", "28:49", "yes because then then as look as the guy", "28:51", "I have to say", "28:52", "oh that's so interesting yeah but that's", "28:54", "a

it's", "39:11", "just super super unnecessary and", "39:14", "unfortunate and part of it is because", "39:16", "there's not enough weight classes", "39:18", "there's like you know there's 155 then", "39:21", "there's 170 the difference between 155", "39:24", "and 170 is not just 15 pounds because if", "39:26", "you actually weigh 155 and this guy's", "39:28", "dropping down to 170 that motherfucker", "39:31", "could be 190 plus right and he's just", "39:34", "figuring out a way to cut weight to get", "39:36", "down to there and that happens all the", "39:37", "time so you're dealing

you", "40:26", "fucking crazy well I've always cut", "40:28", "babies dicks I've been cutting babies", "40:30", "dicks for years like this is right it's", "40:32", "any more of a Yiddish ex you get used to", "40:34", "it well it's not just Yiddish I'm", "40:35", "Catholic my dick got cut it's like", "40:38", "practiced yeah across the board under", "40:40", "the guise of you know being sanitary", "40:44", "it's prevention of AIDS there's all", "40:46", "these stupid reasons to cut dicks but it", "40:48", "really it's just a tradition that", "40:49", "doesn't make any goddamn sense now it's", "40:51", "not the best analogy to weight cutting", "40:53", "the cutting dicks I do want to pick up", "40:58", "on an analogy which I'm curious about so", "41:00", "when you're trying to

layer of", "41:10", "expertise makes a bunch of random arm", "41:13", "movements and and head movements and hip", "41:15", "movements yeah into something else we", "41:17", "have the same problem in like math and", "41:19", "physics where everybody wants to know", "41:21", "mmm what's going on with that thing and", "41:23", "then when you I've been listening to", "41:25", "like the physicists on your program I", "41:27", "don't that you have many mathematicians", "41:29", "but it's so confusing to figure out how", "41:33", "to talk to the world about things that", "41:35", "people everybody wants to know about and", "41:37", "I was just curious as if you saw a", "41:40", "parallel in those two things though", "41:42", "certainly very high art forms yeah Sean", "41:46", "Carroll has done a really good job of", "41:48", "trying to explain things neil degrasse", "41:49", "tyson's done a really good job trying to", "41:51", "explain things glass I saw the", "41:53", "explanation of gauge

idea what the fuck he", "42:04", "said exactly well like well I've read", "42:07", "his book yeah and after I read his book", "42:08", "that was the number one question I had I", "42:10", "said", "42:10", "I need you to explain to me what is", "42:13", "gauge symmetry what does that mean it's", "42:14", "so weird that he didn't I don't think he", "42:17", "expected gonna just bust it out yeah I", "42:20", "don't think so either that's it but I", "42:21", "think that it's so hard to like okay", "42:26", "here's one of my well we'll get back to", "42:28", "Gail symmetry maybe but like when people", "42:31", "say the universe is expanding right what", "42:33", "the fuck does that mean every smaller", "42:36", "every smart person says into what right", "42:40", "you know", "42:41", "like it's the universe what is it", "42:43", "expanding into right and where's it", "42:45", "going right and put it it doesn't make", "42:47", "any sense because the linguistics of the", "42:50", "universe is expanding isn't really what", "42:52", "the but so you're saying the matter in", "42:53", "the universe is moving outwards is that", "42:56", "what the universe is expanding now what", "42:57", "it means is the infinite universe is", "43:00", "getting more infinite or no so the first", "43:04", "of all was that they took did you say", "43:05", "that yeah miss the Teva is kicking in", "43:11", "yeah so if you think about this bottle", "43:14", "okay right", "43:16", "it's the slices of the bottle that are", "43:20", "expanding but if you think of the bottle", "43:22", "is the universe the Bott the bottle", "43:23", "isn't expanding hmm it's just the", "43:26", "cross-sections that are expanding and so", "43:29", "that's what they really mean what they", "43:31", "really mean is something like the", "43:32", "space-time metric on space like", "43:34", "cross-sections has its volume form when", "43:37", "integrated is is higher something like", "43:39", "that mm-hm", "43:40", "some mathematical statement but the", "43:42", "universe is expanding is not helpful to", "43:45", "me like if I wasn't able to read the", "43:48", "math I would say I don't get it well I",

"that's an interesting way that makes", "45:25", "sense let me give you an alternate spin", "45:27", "on quantum mechanics okay so typically", "45:31", "people will say you know the", "45:32", "mind-blowing thing about quantum", "45:33", "mechanics is that it's probabilistic and", "45:36", "that is kind of mind-blowing but if you", "45:39", "actually say it differently you say look", "45:41", "in classical mechanics like Newton stuff", "45:44", "that we feel more comfortable with you", "45:46", "have good questions and bad questions", "45:49", "like if you and I go hang out at the", "45:50", "beach and I say to you hey where is that", "45:54", "wave concentrated at what point does", "45:57", "that wait the wave live you look at me", "45:59", "and say it's a wave it's not", "46:01", "concentrated at a point it's all along", "46:03", "the shore so as a classical physicist", "46:07", "you'd say that's not a good question", "46:08", "Eric and when I ask you a good question", "46:13", "like how fast is that wave front moving", "46:16", "you know along this trajectory or", "46:18", "something you can give me an answer and", "46:19", "it's definite so as long as you ask a", "46:21", "good question in classical mechanics you", "46:24", "get definite answers when you go to", "46:26", "quantum mechanics and you ask a good", "46:27", "question", "46:28", "technically that means that the state", "46:31", "vector is an observable of the hermitian", "46:34", "operator representing the question", "46:36", "nevermind funny thing happens you get", "46:40",

"instead of like classical mechanics that", "46:58", "says you know screw off I'm not", "47:00", "answering that that's ridiculous it's a", "47:02", "bad question quantum mechanics says you", "47:04", "really want to ask me a bad question", "47:06", "alright I'll give you maybe this answer", "47:09", "and maybe that answer and here's the", "47:10", "probability distribution that I'll", "47:12", "actually give you either of those two", "47:13", "answers and what's more I'll even kick", "47:15", "it into the state that I that you asked", "47:18", "about so for example if you ask where is", "47:21", "that wave concentrated so like let's say", "47:23", "this is my coffee cup and I drop a", "47:25", "little drop in the center of it that", "47:27", "creates a circular wave that radiates", "47:28", "out and I say where is the wave", "47:30", "concentrated well at one second it hits", "47:33", "the coffee mug let's say is a big coffee", "47:35", "hub and at one second after that it's", "47:38", "concentrated again in the center so that", "47:40", "becomes a good question", "47:41", "only when the wave becomes reconsecrated", "47:44", "in the center of the cup right but if", "47:47", "that wave were a quantum wave I could", "47:49", "ask where is the wave concentrated and", "47:51", "with equal probability", "47:53", "suddenly the wave will concentrate at", "47:56", "some point along the circle that", "47:58", "represents the wave right so what would", "48:01", "your answer be then well the point would", "48:03", "be it'll concentrate it one of these", "48:05", "points around the circle at random with", "48:07", "equal width equal probability and", "48:09", "suddenly the wave will concentrate", "48:11", "randomly when it's a quantum question so", "48:14", "this is why quantum mechanics is so", "48:16", "confusing quantum physics are so", "48:17", "confusing to people well cuz they hear", "48:20", "that and they go okay this is just", "48:22", "confuse this when in my head like jello", "48:23", "well that's the thing but the point of", "48:25", "if I if I have a wave and I slow it down", "48:27", "I can look at a wave in a coffee mug", "48:29", "right and I can see that if I ask where", "48:32", "is the wave concentrated you would say", "48:34", "it's concentrated at like half an inch", "48:36", "out from the center of the cup yes no", "48:38", "say no no not what ring is a", "48:40", "concentrated or what exact point it's", "48:43", "not concentrated in an exact point but", "48:45", "that wave in quantum mechanics which is", "48:47", "not concentrated at an", "48:49", "act point behaves differently when I ask", "48:52", "a bad question so the point that I'm", "48:53", "trying to get across is good questions", "48:57", "have exactly the same properties in", "48:59", "classical mechanics and quantum", "49:00", "mechanics there's no introduction of", "49:01", "probability theory the weird question is", "49:04", "why is quantum mechanics answering bad", "49:06", "questions", "49:07", "well maybe even weird a question is not", "49:14", "just why's is it's quantum mechanics in", "49:16", "an adolescent state of understanding I", "49:18", "mean it is it part of the problem that", "49:19", "they don't know enough yet and they're", "49:22", "trying to like explain what they do know", "49:24", "what they can prove on paper

doesn't have", "49:34", "any studying in it just goes love what", "49:37", "does that mean well that's great so like", "49:39", "let's say we were having a conversation", "49:40", "about genetics and we were looking only", "49:42", "at the DNA and we didn't see epigenetics", "49:45", "right in terms of like methylation", "49:47", "patterns then you'd you'd shove", "49:50", "everything on to DNA

wouldn't explain all sorts", "50:00", "of other things and so now then you over", "50:02", "over develop that model so I think that", "50:05", "what you're saying is really Einstein's", "50:08", "intuition which is I'm not saying all", "50:11", "right Stein I'm not saying that this is", "50:12", "wrong I'm saying this is incomplete and", "50:14", "then when we finally get the answer", "50:16", "we're gonna say oh that's why we used to", "50:18", "think of it in those crazy terms hmm so", "50:21", "back to gauge theory yeah gauge symmetry", "50:23", "what the hell was that all right well", "50:26", "here's that here's the craziest thing", "50:28", "okay there is a very confusing visual", "50:31", "image of the fundamental unit that you", "50:34", "need to appreciate what gauge

it's worth it", "51:02", "this is what you're looking at is a", "51:05", "principal fiber bundle and it's an it is", "51:09", "the earth those are the continents well", "51:12", "yeah that's the cool part about it which", "51:14", "is this is very confusing to figure out", "51:17", "what you're looking at but it's finite", "51:19", "in other words if we stay it for an hour", "51:22", "or two on this and we actually answer", "51:24", "all your questions you will actually", "51:25", "know what a principal bundle is and you", "51:27", "will know the arena in which gauge", "51:29", "Theory exists for folks at home that are", "51:32", "just listening and they what the fuck of", "51:34", "these guys talking about what is the", "51:35", "name of this video Jamie it's not a", "51:38",

gonna get it", "53:28", "completely during this session however I", "53:31", "think I lack the tools I don't think so", "53:34", "if it we lack the time so the first", "53:36", "thing is you are

confusing to me I would", "54:49", "rather your people be confused about an", "54:52", "actual example of the object on which we", "54:54", "do gauge theory that you can visually", "54:57", "see hmm right now if I started to tell", "55:00", "you what gage theory is it's pretty", "55:04", "simple so here's and here's a", "55:06", "description I never hear anyone say when", "55:09", "you're doing differential calculus I", "55:11", "don't know if you remember differential", "55:12", "calculus you're trying to figure out the", "55:14", "slopes of lines you draw instantaneous", "55:16", "rise over the run so that always makes", "55:20", "sense to people okay I figure out how", "55:21", "fast it's going up versus how fast it's", "55:23", "going across", "55:25", "but a question arises which is where do", "55:28", "you measure the rise from so for example", "55:31", "if I say what is the height of Mount", "55:34", "Everest Jamie will say 30 was 35,000", "55:40", "yeah something crazy like that well", "55:43", "let's just go a thousand say base well", "55:45", "we're gonna get an internet connection", "55:46", "yes what do you think it is I don't know", "55:49", "I can't remember I would say it's 35,000", "55:52", "what do you think that was 29 29 Oh", "55:55", "tonight no okay what's the highest was", "55:58", "the highest one is it key to all right", "56:01", "key to the second right is it has", "56:04", "Everest the highest yeah okay so okay", "56:06", "Everest so 29 would you say 29 29 89", "56:09", "what unite above what sea level okay", "56:14", "where is Mount Everest located the", "56:17", "Himalayas what is that what see there's", "56:20", "no ocean area right so right like we", "56:22", "snuck in it's above sea level and", "56:24", "there's no ocean so we start from the", "56:26", "center of the earth we have this", "56:27", "structure called the geoid which is the", "56:30", "interpolation of sea level as if see", "56:32", "love as if the earth was only ocean and", "56:34", "there was no tide right and as if", "56:36", "there's some sort of uh so we snuck in", "56:38", "the reference level that's my point is", "56:40", "that we teach these kids to repeat why", "56:42", "it's 29,000 and change above sea level", "56:44", "and there's no sea right so that", "56:47", "reference level is the magic of gauge", "56:49", "theory right which is that we measure", "56:52", "the rise over the run based on a custom", "56:55", "level so a level that we all agree upon", "56:59", "so for example let's imagine that you", "57:01", "and I are in some country experiencing", "57:02", "hyperinflation right and I'm your boss", "57:05", "and you say dude I need a raise I said", "57:09", "well look I've told you I would hire you", "57:12", "for you know ten thousand dinars a month", "57:15", "and you say yeah I said well your salary", "57:20", "is constant I took the derivative of it", "57:22", "I've paid you ten thousand five month", "57:24", "ten thousand this month so you're", "57:26", "getting the same amount derivative", "57:27", "equals zero it's constant salary now you", "57:30", "have to come back at me in calculus and", "57:32", "you say no I don't like your notion of", "57:34", "the derivative because what you're doing", "57:36", "is you're measuring the absolute number", "57:38", "of dinars that", "57:39", "you're paying me but what I want to do", "57:42", "is I want to measure it in purchasing", "57:43", "power because I'm losing money every", "57:45", "month that you don't increase my salary", "57:47", "so I now come up with a version of the", "57:50", "calculus in which my key salary is not", "57:53", "constant because it's being measured", "57:55", "relative to purchasing power rather than", "57:58", "absolute units that's gauged thing is", "58:02", "that you're bringing in a reference", "58:03", "level that does the differentiation so", "58:08", "you're measuring rise over run by", "58:10", "customizing the problem so these were", "58:12", "two different applications of the", "58:14", "calculus the cheating employer says I", "58:17", "want to go with constant dinars the", "58:19", "gifted employee says not so fast", "58:22", "I know gage theory I want to use a", "58:24", "custom reference level which is", "58:25", "purchasing power right so it's like", "58:28", "sneaking the geoid into Tibet to measure", "58:31", "Everest I've got my custom level does", "58:34", "this make sense to you yes it makes", "58:36", "sense right but now explain it say what", "58:38", "he said the way I mean we would need a", "58:42", "new reference of what what you want to", "58:43", "measure what would a new conversation to", "58:46", "have a rough like a flat level right", "58:47", "right I guess yeah it would be really", "58:50", "difficult for me to recall a day from", "58:51", "now maybe have the wheat pop a mushroom", "59:00", "cap see what's up it's still in", "59:04", "reference to quantum physics like how", "59:07", "you would you gauge symmetry well but", "59:09", "let you would let's look at some more", "59:11", "cool stuff okay at the visual cortex", "59:12", "because everything that we can do", "59:14", "visually should inform what we can do", "59:16", "linguistically so you should push", "59:18", "everything into the visual realm that", "59:19", "you can even buy that like I just showed", "59:23", "you the hopf fibration which is the only", "59:25", "in some sense the only mature picture I", "59:30", "can show you of a principle fibration in", "59:32", "geometry or physics that is honest and", "59:36", "has the full complexity it's got a", "59:38", "certain kind of knotted 'no stew it it's", "59:40", "got something that we would call", "59:42", "curvature and it is visualizable and so", "59:47", "it would be better that we spent you", "59:50", "know a day or two on this most", "59:52", "an object which we think reality is", "59:54", "based around and that you visually got", "59:57", "comfortable with it and then you said", "60:00", "okay now tell me again what gauge", "60:01", "symmetry is and then instead of Lawrence", "60:03", "talking about this chessboard and the", "60:05", "colors and all this stuff by analogy you", "60:08", "would actually be seeing gauge Theory", "60:10", "visually like I could program a computer", "60:12", "and have done so just show you visually", "60:15", "what a gauge theory is and it takes some", "60:18", "time to sort of understand what the", "60:19", "tripi pictures are but if let's bring up", "60:21", "the Escher staircase and Jamie has a", "60:25", "nice wrinkle on this that instead of", "60:27", "using MC escher staircase he's got this", "60:30", "animated guy who just keeps going down", "60:32", "hmm all right now what's going on with", "60:34", "those stairs now the stairs are sort of", "60:38", "an optical illusion because I obviously", "60:39", "can't just keep going down but then you", "60:41", "build these system systems like", "60:43", "rock-paper-scissors what's the best", "60:45", "thing to throw in rock-paper-scissors", "60:46", "well it depends on what you throw well", "60:49", "but we should be able to agree that rock", "60:51", "is better than scissors rock is better", "60:53", "than citizens of papers better than rock", "60:55", "right so you go around that thing and", "60:57", "now the the point is that you get to", "60:58", "like rock is much better than rock right", "61:01", "yeah that seems crazy now that concept", "61:03", "would be what we would call hollow no me", "61:05", "the weird sentence rock is better than", "61:07", "rock because of that going around the", "61:09", "loop why rock is better than rock I", "61:11", "don't get it well rock scissors is", "61:14", "better than paper right paper is better", "61:16", "than rock so by transitivity rock is", "61:19", "therefore better than rock because you", "61:20", "went around the loop and came back to", "61:22", "rock it's like an I'm a math yeah yeah", "61:25", "or if like if you're if you're changing", "61:28", "currencies and you don't spend any of it", "61:30", "because you keep you lose using your", "61:32", "credit card by the time you come home", "61:34", "you have more money than when you left", "61:36", "because the exchange rates did some", "61:38", "things so that when you changed into", "61:40", "each currency you somehow got richer but", "61:43", "by saying Brock is better than Brock", "61:44", "you're denying the fact they're exactly", "61:46", "the same well no they're not you're not", "61:48", "addressing I just want to believe that", "61:50", "the linguistic fallacy right so the idea", "61:52", "that this system here so those stairs in", "61:57", "engage theory would be these reference", "61:59", "levels for the derivative mm-hmm and you", "62:02", "can have situations where the reference", "62:03", "levels don't knit flatly together", "62:06", "right mm-hmm and so by virtue of that we", "62:10", "would say that the system has curvature", "62:12", "curvature is the assuredness of of these", "62:17", "better than transitive statements what", "62:19", "we're looking at folks for people just", "62:21", "listening we're looking at if you've", "62:23", "never seen those s-sure edges those", "62:25", "sketches they're very strange because", "62:26", "what there are is a bunch of staircases", "62:28", "that appear to always be going downhill", "62:32", "even if one of them is above the other", "62:34", "one", "62:34", "it's very strange very strange and this", "62:36", "one we're watching an animated guy roll", "62:38", "down this staircase constantly even", "62:41", "though it really looks like somehow or", "62:42", "another it must go up somewhere but you", "62:45", "don't ever see it going up but it's also", "62:47", "a factor of the illusion of perspective", "62:50", "and how it's drawn and and you know", "62:52", "playing games with lines exactly but if", "62:56", "you do this very weird experiment which", "62:59", "we didn't know about until the late 50s", "63:00", "called the Aronoff Boehm experiment if", "63:04", "you run a electric current through a", "63:11", "wire that's insulated it appears not to", "63:15", "have any electromagnetic field outside", "63:17", "of the insulation however if you do some", "63:20", "sort of quantum interference experiment", "63:22", "you can tell that there's current going", "63:24", "through because it affects the Fage", "63:26", "phase shift let's say of an electron", "63:29", "orbiting that insulated electromagnetic", "63:32", "system so nobody thought that was going", "63:35", "to happen because they thought well an", "63:37", "insulator would keep we thought the", "63:39", "electromagnetic field is what determines", "63:42", "the shift in the electron but it's", "63:44", "insulated so there is no electromagnetic", "63:45", "field to worry about it turned out that", "63:47", "it wasn't the electromagnetic field", "63:49", "alone it was some previous geometric", "63:52", "concept which was called the", "63:54", "electromagnetic potential that", "63:55", "determines something about the phase", "63:57", "shift so this issue staircase in the", "64:00", "case of electromagnetism it's like the", "64:02", "photons are the analog of those steps", "64:04", "they're partially would determine the", "64:07", "derivative operators these reference", "64:09", "levels and again in our discussion of", "64:11", "the am i paying you the right amount in", "64:14", "a hyperinflationary economy", "64:15", "so all of these things you're trying to", "64:18", "figure out well that's an optical", "64:19", "illusion but that effect actually occurs", "64:22", "in some systems not as an optical", "64:24", "illusion yes right so this weirdness", "64:30", "requires a fair amount in terms of", "64:32", "either study of math or learning", "64:36", "visualizations but there's no way to", "64:38", "achieve it in my experience with", "64:40", "linguistic communications like all the", "64:43", "stuff that gets said about you know the", "64:46", "universe is expanding or let me tell you", "64:49", "what it h theory is and why there's a", "64:52", "reason it's confusing it's cuz it", "64:53", "doesn't make any effing sense right I", "64:55", "see what you're saying", "64:56", "sort of but so this is this is like what", "65:01", "Fineman said if you think you know", "65:03", "quantum physics you don't know quantum", "65:04", "physics well there's there some of that", "65:06", "like there's you know one of the most", "65:08", "important things in the world is this", "65:10", "thing called a spinner like the", "65:13", "electrons and the protons correspond to", "65:15", "things called spinners and the average", "65:17", "person has no idea that spinners exist", "65:19", "what's more spinners have a property", "65:22", "that when I tell it to you", "65:24", "linguistically won't make any sense all", "65:27", "right", "65:27", "okay let's do this with coffee okay", "65:31", "yeah thank you sir", "65:34", "perfect all right here's the problem", "65:36", "okay hold your cup up sorry from the", "65:39", "bottom and here's the first challenge", "65:42", "without spilling it okay I want you and", "65:45", "without readjusting your grip on the", "65:46", "bottom of your cup I want you to turn", "65:48", "your cup 360 degrees no no sorry turn", "65:52", "your fingers should not change on the", "65:55", "cup okay turn the cup 360 degrees", "65:59", "without spilling it and try to take a", "66:01", "sit", "66:06", "okay that didn't work no now without", "66:09", "coming back how would you take a sip if", "66:11", "I got it all the way around that way", "66:12", "yeah mr. jiu-jitsu man yeah no no you're", "66:22", "gonna do it all right you ready yeah", "66:24", "okay here we go", "66:25", "oh you're gonna go around circle 360", "66:27", "okay right now I'm screwed if I don't", "66:33", "bring it back underneath oh I see so", "66:36", "that system required 720 degrees of", "66:39", "rotation unexpectedly oh you just keep", "66:41", "going right", "66:42", "okay now the idea that there are objects", "66:46", "that don't come back to themselves under", "66:49", "360 degrees of rotation but require 720", "66:52", "is probably something you've never", "66:53", "thought about before in your life", "66:54", "right but without that you wouldn't have", "66:56", "the Pauli exclusion principle you", "66:58", "wouldn't have the stability of matter", "66:59", "and this thing is called the Philippine", "67:02", "wine dance Jamie do you want - that's", "67:07", "not very seductive Jeff it seems like", "67:09", "some very odd ethnic dance yeah but like", "67:12", "maybe you could do 11th planet jiu-jitsu", "67:14", "here we go so this spinner is one of the", "67:23", "coolest most important objects anywhere", "67:26", "and it was discovered to be important in", "67:28", "physics by a guy named Paul Dirac right", "67:32", "it's fun okay so this 720 theory is", "67:38", "entirely responsible for the world that", "67:41", "we live in this is so bizarre don't", "67:43", "knowbut an animation and nobody knows", "67:44", "about it", "67:45", "right like unless you're hanging out", "67:47", "with physicists they don't tell you that", "67:50", "electromagnetism has to do with the fact", "67:52", "that there's a secret circle at every", "67:54", "point in space and time that's invisible", "67:56", "to you they don't tell you that there's", "67:58", "stuff that requires 720 degrees of", "68:00", "rotation they just say mind-blowing", "68:01", "stuff about whoa so what is happening in", "68:05", "is 720 degrees of rotation in the", "68:08", "quantum world there's an object that is", "68:11", "requiring this just the way the cup", "68:13", "armed system requires 720 degrees for", "68:16", "what options it's called a spinner", "68:18", "and that spinner is how we model the", "68:22", "electron the neutrino quarks all that is", "68:26", "spin oriole matter sir that's a good",

beyond", "86:52", "space-time oh this is my 8 D surface", "86:54", "princess my arch-nemesis when I was", "86:56", "telling the story last time their", "86:58", "interest over October yeah Garrett

don't", "87:09", "remember this I do now yeah you got off", "87:11", "my story man see right yeah I'm sorry", "87:13", "that's all right go for it here we are", "87:14", "again if I go so whoa what is that well", "87:21", "this is this is based on the eight", "87:23", "dimensional I'm almost certain this can", "87:25", "be based on the eight dimensional root", "87:26", "system so inside of the 248

make I can related things that", "87:56", "make sense to me if the idea is you know", "87:58", "can I look at it the way I'd look at a", "87:59", "barcode right say Oh tie it unsent it no", "88:03", "no idea", "88:04", "but but this is an accurate", "88:07", "representation if you're looking at it", "88:09", "in two dimensions yeah so what what I'm", "88:11", "what I'm trying to say is you don't even", "88:14", "know to worry about this pattern right", "88:17", "because you've never heard that these", "88:19", "things exist and this is like the", "88:22", "closest that we come to you know

creation right that's", "91:29", "a sexy word yes actually", "91:31", "but like if we're saying the Big Bang", "91:35", "existed and that means some point in the", "91:39", "history of the universe it was this", "91:41", "really tiny thing and it decided for", "91:44", "whatever reason something happened right", "91:46", "and it became this enormous thing", "91:47", "sure impossibly enormous thing

billion", "92:38", "is a number that makes sense flush but", "92:40", "conceptually yeah like for a dummy like", "92:42", "me 14 billion is like if I really if I'm", "92:45", "being honest do I really do you think I", "92:47", "really have an accurate understanding", "92:48", "what 14 billion and no but Steven", "92:50", "Weinberg doesn't feel 14 billion either", "92:52", "right but you know where 100 yds is so", "92:55", "Hans you can feel that right I see a", "92:57", "hundred yards I'm like that's too far to", "92:59", "shoot a bow yeah like you got to get a", "93:00", "little closer to be

right there's", "93:17", "there's weirdness in distance right but", "93:20", "when you get to a hundred and forty", "93:23", "million miles okay yeah I give up but", "93:26", "yeah it's a fort I get the teal right", "93:28", "here yeah I get fatigued by that stuff", "93:30", "so other people get energized like yeah", "93:32", "man it's humbling right", "93:36", "well the lemon is the concept of",

billion", "93:47", "years ago right it's like but that's", "93:49", "just as far back as we're capable of", "93:51", "seeing right now and even if we did go", "93:55", "further the light is actually moving", "93:57", "slower like you wouldn't be able to see", "94:00", "it", "94:00", "right right right so you have this thing", "94:03", "about with the space-time metric which", "94:05", "is sort of

that", "95:41", "means this and then you're explaining", "95:42", "all these other words and then he's", "95:44", "throwing it all together I'm like what", "95:45", "and then it's cultural references then", "95:47", "you have to deal with the fact that", "95:48", "there's like some historical precedent", "95:50", "to certain types of behavior that I", "95:51", "don't take into consideration because", "95:52", "these are French people that have lived", "95:54", "in this way okay but look well that's", "95:57", "nothing compared to later ah let's drop", "95:59", "some so you do this thing about like", "96:01", "well for meathead like me well I", "96:04", "definitely immediate help stop it juice", "96:05", "and know I know me better than you know", "96:07", "me that's true but you're also less", "96:09", "honest than you think on this particular", "96:11", "topic it's part of your charm now look", "96:12", "when we hang out we hang out usually in", "96:15", "a comedy club or at

went to it I did", "96:26", "stand up for the first time as I told", "96:28", "you in Arizona I was there oh it was", "96:31", "insane it was crazy", "96:33", "yeah you trying to explain fucking",

know", "96:47", "there's a way to do it okay well who was", "96:49", "the guy who did that some guy was doing", "96:52", "how many he was Bryan Callen was doing", "96:53", "quantum jokes what was he saying", "96:55", "do you remember forgot he just he had a", "96:57", "bunch of words that he did very very", "96:58", "quickly and it kind of hung together I", "97:00", "was like wait what yeah that sounds like", "97:02", "Bryan yeah he reads a lot but it's a", "97:05", "clever boy when I when I had to do my 10", "97:09", "minutes of stand-up man is that Kraft", "97:11", "it's it's deep it's hard

weird", "100:19", "that's a weird equation but like take", "100:22", "something very simple like the harmonic", "100:23", "yeah yeah most people don't know that", "100:26", "that sweet blues sound on a harmonica", "100:28", "comes from not using it the way the", "100:30", "manufacturer said which is called", "100:32", "straight harp and using it instead the", "100:35", "way african-americans

is he", "102:49", "playing that goddamn harmonica", "102:50", "I want to hear that put it back in your", "102:51", "pocket go to your next trip you already", "102:54", "painted in these people's estimation", "102:55", "that's attention whore what's worse a", "103:00", "harmonica or a guy brings a guitar and", "103:02", "starts singing folk songs at a party on", "103:04", "the animal house

this little tiny thing that people", "103:54", "of faith like there's not other ones", "103:55", "right there's like other things are like", "103:57", "these big old trumpet looking things", "103:59",

think", "125:02", "I said that the last day yes here and", "125:03", "I'm really excited if that goes forward", "125:06", "well it really doesn't seem like", "125:07", "anything else right you know whether", "125:09", "it's a cuttlefish or whether it's an", "125:10", "octopus like you like oh it's like kind", "125:12", "of like a squid like yeah a little bit", "125:15", "like a person's like a

both the octopus is the", "125:26", "collagen right but like a regenerate", "125:29", "that's another part of it that's bizarre", "125:31", "yeah well it would be fun to do a I", "125:35", "would imagine that newts", "125:36", "salamanders in the tetrapod category", "125:39", "would be the best for us to study for", "125:40", "regeneration", "125:41", "I like how they regenerated up to a",

cut their head off yeah why do you", "126:15", "wanna cut their head off", "126:16", "I don't but I mean just saying it's", "126:18", "weird like you can't like chop them in", "126:20", "half from the waist down", "126:22", "they don't seal up and grow a new waist", "126:23", "like that's it you can only get rid of", "126:26", "the limbs yeah but you can get rid of", "126:28", "the limbs like

this", "126:37", "successful head transplant in monkeys in", "126:39", "like the early seventies and then we", "126:41", "walked away from it probably good move", "126:43", "otherwise chicks at

that and then say okay too", "127:11", "much can't handle it do you think that's", "127:13", "what they did", "127:13", "oh yeah is it probably hard to get", "127:15", "funding people thought you're playing", "127:16", "God ah the guy who did it I think was", "127:19", "maybe his name is Robert white and he", "127:21", "was a devout Christian so it was really", "127:23", "it was good because you know there was a", "127:26", "lot of this reverence for the human form", "127:28", "and if a religious person is doing it we", "127:31", "feel better than if somebody is like", "127:32", "desecrating

just say", "127:51", "hey what happens if I cut this monkey's", "127:52", "head off stick it on another monkey well", "127:55", "there's all this crazy I don't know if", "127:56", "you've ever seen this the Russians had", "127:59", "this film introduced by JBS Haldane", "128:02", "great English biologist was also a", "128:04", "communist and therefore very Pro Soviet", "128:05", "and there's

"well what what does your study of the", "128:59", "biological would inform us about our", "129:01", "Great Creator and how they had him back", "129:04", "he said that he has an inordinate", "129:06",

"129:15", "to our to our way of thinking it's not", "129:18", "that hard of a burn well we're really", "129:20", "committed to the idea that all the stuff", "129:22", "that we can do manipulating the planet", "129:25", "right sending rockets into space that", "129:27", "that's more important than what an ant", "129:29", "does what we're really committed to this", "129:31", "that our significance although it's", "129:32", "clearly if we were working together we", "129:34", "believed in a sense of community it's", "129:35", "more important to each other to us it is", "129:38", "but to the whole thing is really more", "129:40", "important says who", "129:42", "I mean if people didn't exist yeah we", "129:44", "were wiped off the planet all the other", "129:46", "animals would be ok they really would be", "129:48", "ok I mean we would gain and lose more", "129:51", "predators and we wouldn't be controlling", "129:53", "the population sure but if all the ants", "129:56", "went away mm-hmm that would be a wrap", "129:58", "yeah there'd be a wrap we're done", "130:01", "there's no more people this is a", "130:03", "why huh decided that if we lost all", "130:06", "insects especially all ants right like", "130:09", "it probably would collapse all the", "130:11", "ecosystems that we need to sustain human", "130:13", "life I have the feeling that those water", "130:15", "bear tardigrades would be like suckers", "130:18", "got rid of the ants we're the only ones", "130:20", "left", "130:20", "well we wouldn't be able to make it but", "130:22", "a lot of shit would make it a lot of", "130:24", "other stuff that's true but you know the", "130:27", "thing that I think maybe we'd make it", "130:28", "anyway maybe they're wrong", "130:30", "yes don't understand humans freak us out", "130:32", "yeah maybe didn't read that find out if", "130:35", "that's true if all ants died just human", "130:40", "beings would go extinct just Google that", "130:42", "I think I think I read a paper proposing", "130:45", "that and they were explaining the", "130:46", "critical role that ants play in all", "130:48", "these different ecosystems and how the", "130:50", "biomass of ants worldwide is equal to or", "130:54", "greater than the biomass of human beings", "130:56", "okay I don't have any intuition or and", "131:01", "then yeah sounds reasonable now I'm", "131:03", "pretty sure that's true and so but our", "131:05", "idea is that we're more important well", "131:07", "we are i have cable yeah yeah that's not", "131:10", "why i think we're more high or 4g deer", "131:11", "4g okay maybe that's more I have a 70", "131:16", "inch television and I I have an i watch", "131:19", "yeah it must be more important the", "131:22", "stupid fucking ant was dirt house if I", "131:26", "can just piss on your house while I go", "131:28", "jogging yeah I'm a more more important", "131:31", "thing than you yeah I don't know my", "131:35", "inspiration half your people by pissing", "131:36", "on yeah yeah obviously nature does want", "131:40", "to protect you you get your house in the", "131:41", "dirt it's a whole mound okay I don't", "131:45", "know why I want to get serious on you", "131:47", "but the really interesting thing about", "131:50", "humans is that we're the only species", "131:52", "that understands what game were in and", "131:54", "we can reject the game yes every other", "131:56", "species is playing the game so you know", "131:58", "you know my brother very well very", "132:02", "surprising to me that my brother only", "132:03",

"132:11", "you ever think it's kind of weird that", "132:12", "you're not very playing this game very", "132:14", "effectively and he you know shot me back", "132:16", "this thing he said", "132:17", "if you actually understand the game why", "132:19", "would you want to continue to play it I", "132:21", "thought that was like really interesting", "132:23", "that somebody who sounds like his wife", "132:26", "doesn't want any more kids", "132:29", "rationalizations I get it bro yeah", "132:33", "Derrick I found says all all insects", "132:36", "dying not just ants", "132:37", "Oh insects and would take 50 years for", "132:39", "people to disappear after that according", "132:41", "to this the science Explorer article hmm", "132:44", "find out the biomass of ants that's even",

no significance in the", "133:06", "whole game if you just take a completely", "133:07", "material it's like what do we care it's", "133:09", "one Rock once back big deal all right so", "133:11", "the problem is if you accept that as an", "133:14", "answer then you've kind of failed by", "133:18", "just taking the nihilist way out yeah", "133:20", "sure to me like you know that they have",

this", "135:50", "collection of you know 10 or 50 trillion", "135:53", "separate entities and that's what makes", "135:56", "ants so terrifying yeah is is that you", "135:59", "know Kropotkin the

"137:00", "concrete they flooded concrete in all", "137:01", "the holes and then they dug out", "137:03", "everything around it so you could see", "137:05", "the structure and then they explained", "137:07", "what there's this is really like", "137:10", "well-thought-out like they have portals", "137:12", "and they have the this is how they get", "137:14", "the food in and this is where they take", "137:15", "the leaves and they they let they let", "137:17", "them rot and they turn to mulch and", "137:19", "there's like a gas release distributed", "137:22", "loosely coupled system what

these", "137:33", "structures it's lesson it's that's more", "137:38", "amazing than what it is which is it's a", "137:40", "loosely coupled distributed system hmm", "137:44", "you know so that's how a beehive will", "137:47", "you know send out explorers and they'll", "137:50", "report back and they'll do the dance and", "137:52", "the dance communicates the information", "137:54", "and you've

is gorgeous yeah this is the", "138:08", "video we're talking about so this is", "138:09", "it's really huge too and they have these", "138:14", "looks like tunnel systems and then they", "138:17",

like tiny little head this little", "139:42", "head how's he figure out that hole how", "139:45", "do you figuring out tunnels that he's", "139:46", "not really insane not well right this is",

and I think this is a very", "141:15", "recent discovery at least one this large", "141:18", "and these guys are swimming around with", "141:20", "this thing it looks impossible it looks", "141:23",

say and its dwarfing them it's", "142:23", "enormous", "142:24", "it's so big it's like the size in what", "142:28", "moves and changes but it sometimes it's", "142:30", "larger than a human waste or

like I don't", "142:45", "understand what they're saying that it's", "142:47", "made up of hundreds of thousands of", "142:48", "organisms like how is it made up of", "142:50", "different stuff like what is it like", "142:52", "have you ever heard of anything like", "142:53", "this not like the Portuguese man-of-war", "142:55", "I think is like five different organisms", "142:58", "isn't it isn't it that collaborate in", "143:01", "effect really the Portuguese Man Wars", "143:04", "not a flicker one thing look at the size", "143:07", "that thing above the water that is", "143:10", "fucking crazy", "143:13", "Pyrus ohm just whatever the ocean is", "143:17", "like that like we're all we're trying to", "143:19", "look into space like I wonder if there's", "143:21", "aliens out there there", "143:22", "here I know right fucking there like", "143:25", "whether it's cuttlefish or octopus or", "143:27", "this goddamn thing whoa", "143:31", "pyro somme what the fuck that thing", "143:34", "looks like a geometric pattern that's a", "143:37", "nice one look at that one in the upper", "143:39", "right hand corner Jamie what is that", "143:40", "weird looking fucking them what is that", "143:42", "thing 60 foot long jet-powered animal oh", "143:47", "god it's like a civilization it's like a", "143:49", "ship of these things flying through the", "143:52", "ocean what have you ever seen this", "143:54", "before what the fuck is that", "143:56", "that is so weird-looking oh come on man", "144:00", "that looks like something from Avatar", "144:01", "doesn't yeah it totally does right like", "144:04", "that could something that comes off that", "144:05", "tree hopefully put it in the new movie", "144:07", "yeah it's held called James Cameron look", "144:10", "at this thing so this is what those", "144:13", "things are but the other one is a very", "144:14", "smooth or it's low resolution and we", "144:17", "can't get a really good look at it", "144:18", "but that's what it is it's this", "144:19", "collective group of hundreds of", "144:21", "thousands of organisms that combined", "144:24", "together and they're getting jacked by", "144:25", "that turtle all you bitches what a weird", "144:31", "weird organism look at that", "144:33", "look at this picture if you stuck your", "144:37", "arm in it I just dude how bizarre is it", "144:39", "that there's a civilization of these", "144:42", "things all combined but what they are is", "144:45", "individuals that operate as a giant tube", "144:50", "you never heard of this before now I'm", "144:52", "so happy we found something you don't", "144:54", "know about that was that's how fucking", "144:59", "weird one man but yeah the idea that the", "145:02", "ocean is really an alien world yeah all", "145:04", "right well the funniest part is when you", "145:06", "when you hear these guys with their", "145:08", "remote submersibles and they find some", "145:12", "new life-form yeah yeah they're like", "145:14", "take me down believe me those wait what", "145:18", "is that you know they get really excited", "145:19", "yeah because it it's the ability to meet", "145:23", "aliens there are new things yeah I mean", "145:26", "we we've kind of sorta mapped out the", "145:28", "best you're more or less oh yeah there's", "145:31", "like a few weird things you fought in", "145:33", "the jungle weird bug", "145:34", "where's not yet Vietnam has some", "145:36", "surprises for a seer with fangs", "145:38", "oh you ever seen those oh the Sulawesi", "145:41", "boars or they'll daddy here really", "145:43", "vampire deer I don't know I don't know", "145:45", "about vampires it's the craziest looking", "145:46", "thing ever it's deer with fangs", "145:49", "like crocodile looking fangs that come", "145:51", "hanging down like this this is some", "145:53", "Jackalope thing oh god it's a weird", "145:56", "little animal it's not a big deer either", "145:58", "well do you know look at that thing", "146:00", "vampire deer that's a real animal look", "146:04", "at that how fuckin strange what was this", "146:09", "what was in this coffee Jamie look at", "146:11", "that thing look at the fucking teeth on", "146:13", "that thing", "146:14", "it's probably something akin to their", "146:18", "antlers they use it to defend themselves", "146:20", "ok that's not real it's not real", "146:22", "because that's a mule deer see that one", "146:24", "that you just pick that's that's some", "146:26", "Photoshop bullshit what's interesting is", "146:28", "apparently elk have these things called", "146:32", "the people call them ivories now but", "146:34", "they what they are is at one point in", "146:36", "time they had tusks yeah like a boar", "146:38", "yeah like giant tusks that probably", "146:40", "aided them and their fights and they", "146:43", "eventually shrank and now they're just", "146:45", "this weird sort of nubby thing I", "146:48", "actually have some here I'll show it to", "146:50", "you yeah yeah they're in the after the", "146:52", "podcast I'll show em to you but they", "146:54", "they're this weird thing that's like not", "146:56", "quite a tooth it's ivory it grows inside", "146:59", "their head and at one point in time it", "147:01", "was some kind of a weapon just like", "147:02", "their head is I mean the antlers are you", "147:05", "know that's the largest but how do we", "147:08", "describe this what was the quickest", "147:10", "growing thing in the animal world is the", "147:15", "the antlers of an elk okay look how", "147:17", "fucking huge they are they fall off", "147:19", "every year and they grow back every year", "147:21", "and it's all just for fighting and they", "147:23", "used to grow back tusks too are these to", "147:25", "have to the answer the tusks were", "147:27", "permanent but they used to just it's", "147:29", "just for duking it out yeah it's crazy", "147:32", "weapon their sexual selection well you", "147:35", "want to know really weird thing of the", "147:36", "dung beetle um there's a conserved", "147:39", "system whereby in some dung beetles the", "147:42", "amount of weaponry you have is your", "147:44", "antler is inversely proportional to the", "147:47", "amount of copulatory apparatus you have", "147:49", "where it counts well and so if you have", "147:53", "really impressive weaponry you're not", "147:57", "able to do quite as much and that may be", "148:01", "the engine of speciation is because the", "148:04", "vagina and penis in that system is a", "148:06", "lock and key and so if something shrinks", "148:08", "too much then you can't necessarily get", "148:11", "get the job so if a greedy dung beetle", "148:14", "with giant horns just fucks everybody up", "148:16", "his genes can't pass on maybe there's a", "148:18", "certain round of cooperation that's", "148:20", "needed in the dung beetle world yeah", "148:22", "can't have an oppressor can of a Genghis", "148:24", "Khan of the dung beetle world the", "148:26", "patriarchy and the dung beetle world", "148:28", "look at the size of the antler on that", "148:29", "guy yeah but girls make fun of them", "148:31", "probably the dung beetle world like the", "148:35", "guy with the Lamborghini exactly like", "148:38", "what's he doing over there with his", "148:39", "giant it looks like elk antler's", "148:42", "probably is a tiny little dick you want", "148:44", "you want a guy who's just got little", "148:46", "like that like that guy probably", "148:47", "probably hung like a roach right he have", "148:51", "a hunting question for you okay I", "148:53", "started looking into this like primitive", "148:55", "hunting thing I was positively", "148:57", "predisposed towards hunting and I turned", "149:00", "myself off I mean I don't hunt but I", "149:03", "turned myself off of hunting by watching", "149:06", "the effect of some of these people who", "149:09", "are baiting and killing bears in ways", "149:12", "that it just doesn't feel to me like", "149:15", "hyper respectful right and I wondered if", "149:19", "there's like a deeper layer where if I", "149:21", "got even deeper into it I would", "149:23", "understand it or am I actually correct", "149:25", "that there is something weird about the", "149:28", "effect of attracting some beautiful bear", "149:31", "to a kind of easy place to kill it and", "149:34", "then just getting super excited about", "149:36", "doing it in well your natural instincts", "149:40", "yeah there's a reason for them and", "149:42", "you're most certainly correct it's it's", "149:43", "a weird feeling the idea that you're", "149:46", "going to trick this bear and thinking", "149:48", "he's going there to eat and then you", "149:49", "kill them yeah bear hunting is different", "149:52", "than any other kind of hunting in the", "149:53", "first of all there's a lot of emotional", "149:55", "attachment to it because people love", "149:56", "teddy bears and things along those lines", "149:58", "but bears are", "150:00", "this idea that they're beautiful they", "150:02", "definitely are yeah they definitely", "150:04", "they're also one of the more ruthless", "150:06", "animals in the animal kingdom and", "150:07", "they're all cannibals all of them and", "150:09", "the male's don't don't just go after the",

has to happen either", "150:51", "they have to use dogs which is what", "150:53", "these two use a lot these two used to be", "150:54", "California until the 1990s they outlawed", "150:56", "hound hunting and then the outlawed", "150:59", "baiting around the same time what they", "151:01", "essentially did in Northern California", "151:03", "is they outlawed bear hunting but they", "151:05",

they're emotional creatures but I", "151:39", "understand yeah they're all they're all", "151:41", "beautiful okay so you know I think I", "151:42", "mean I think the frogs are beautiful", "151:44",

still at the level the the thing", "152:03", "that surprised me was that the effect", "152:08", "wasn't the expected effect of the hunter", "152:13", "with reverence in some sense sufficient",
