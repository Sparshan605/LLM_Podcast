["00:00", "trained my day Joe Rogan podcast by", "00:02", "night okay now when you guys watch MMA", "00:06", "and you see someone like Stephen", "00:08", "Thompson that has very few elements of", "00:12", "Muay Thai he uses but he uses a lot of", "00:15", "sport karate yeah which is uh you know", "00:17", "completely different stance a completely", "00:20", "different style what's your take on that", "00:22", "when you watch that or what his style or", "00:25", "when they just say oh it's more time", "00:27", "well they definitely don't really mean", "00:28", "well it seems like some leg kicks and", "00:31", "some techniques but essentially he's", "00:33", "doing a sport karate style well it was", "00:35", "kind of the same thing with Anderson so", "00:37", "it's like just because someone's", "00:38", "throwing an elbow just because", "00:39", "somebody's has a clinch doesn't", "00:41", "necessarily make it Muay Thai there's a", "00:43", "lot of arts that have those things you", "00:44", "know what I mean and I'm not gonna view", "00:46", "him as a Muay Thai fight I think of", "00:48", "Anderson is a muy Thai fighter not at", "00:49", "all he thought of himself as a Muay Thai", "00:51", "fighter that's okay but but I like I", "00:54", "wouldn't of you him as a Muay Thai", "00:56", "fighter at all I imagine MMA I think", "00:58", "anything he did was very muta even his", "01:00", "clench was I mean that's such a", "01:01", "fundamental basic clinch you know I mean", "01:04", "that's just because everyone else was so", "01:06", "terrible at it right so I grabbed the", "01:07", "neck like you don't see that in", "01:09", "high-level Muay Thai guys going up and", "01:10", "grabbing each other by the neck it's in", "01:12", "transition when they hurt people when", "01:13", "they get tired very it's very much", "01:16", "us of struggling for dominance over", "01:19", "under those kind of things it's like a", "01:21", "big sloppy ridiculous armbar yeah dude I", "01:23", "mean like like it's like that's like day", "01:25", "one Muay Thai so when you saw the like", "01:28", "the Rich Franklin fight which we're", "01:30", "going where he was in the fuck like how", "01:32", "did he not learn this his first day in", "01:34", "training and what was even worse was I", "01:37", "had a friend that I trained with that", "01:39", "went out to help him for the second one", "01:40", "and he just didn't want to hear it like", "01:42", "they did not want to hear that like dude", "01:45", "you don't know what you're doing at all", "01:46", "because as what we talked about earlier", "01:48", "these guys get to a high level and think", "01:50", "that they're maybe would tie technique", "01:53", "is good and like dude you are like a", "01:55", "kindergartner like you don't know what", "01:56", "you're doing at all what so he didn't", "01:58", "want to listen", "01:59", "so no wow that's crazy actor I look so", "02:04", "who was it that went out with him", "02:06", "Anthony Brown all the training partner", "02:09", "of mine and he was specifically brought", "02:11", "there because of his Motown", "02:12", "yeah without doubt like why would you", "02:14", "why would you bring you know me and if", "02:16", "you're not going to use me I've been", "02:18", "brought in for people to and like why", "02:21", "wouldn't you use what you've brought me", "02:22", "in here to do you know what I mean like", "02:24", "you brought me in for my Muay Thai for", "02:25", "my knowledge in the singing you just", "02:27", "want to keep doing what you're good at", "02:28", "like why am I here this is stupid", "02:30", "that's unfortunate he's such a nice guy", "02:33", "and such a smart guy yeah it was a math", "02:34", "teacher", "02:35", "without doubt how do you not see the", "02:36", "math of that it's when people aren't", "02:39", "people have a false sense of where", "02:42", "they're at in the sport and what they", "02:44", "can do and like you literally know", "02:46", "nothing and but you have this mentality", "02:49", "that you're decent at stand-up you're", "02:51", "decent at Muay Thai and you're terrible", "02:53", "compared to someone that really does", "02:55", "know what they're doing right you know I", "02:57", "mean most people's understanding is very", "03:00", "elementary if that mmm you know you take", "03:04", "another person and I'm gonna I could", "03:05", "beat you without even like touching you", "03:07", "you know I mean JIT and just let you", "03:09", "mess yourself up because you don't", "03:10", "really know what you're doing it's uh", "03:13", "it's crazy to think that someone could", "03:15", "reach a world championship level in", "03:16", "something that involves Muay Thai but", "03:19", "there's so many variables like yeah", "03:20", "there's wrestling there's two Jitsu", "03:22", "there's all these things there's you can", "03:23", "get away with a lot more like the", "03:26", "striking in MMA you can get away with", "03:28", "because of those variables because of", "03:29", "the smaller gloves because of the", "03:31", "takedowns you know you put that person", "03:33", "in the ring with even a moderately good", "03:36", "Muay Thai person a moderately good boxer", "03:39", "they're gonna get murdered right I mean", "03:42", "right right just like you can bring like", "03:44", "a really good mood a fighter in but they", "03:45", "don't have any wrestling different", "03:46", "defense or no jiu-jitsu they're not", "03:48", "gonna do it be able to do exactly", "03:49", "exactly looks like an idiot yeah it's", "03:52", "well that's one of the appeals of MMA", "03:54", "yeah is that the guy who wins is most", "03:57", "likely the best fighter because if it", "04:00", "was just more Thai or if it was just", "04:01", "wrestling or if it was just you Jitsu", "04:03", "you would see someone who's the best at", "04:05", "that but when you throw everything in", "04:07", "like it's the kitchen sink get in there", "04:09", "yeah and that's when you know you get to", "04:13", "see like who's been it's even more", "04:15", "complex puzzle yeah well that's why I", "04:17", "like I've never really understood the", "04:18", "argument of like pitting this person", "04:21", "against that person or like who's got", "04:22", "the best movie no mate well nobody", "04:24", "because they're not doing more", "04:26", "they're doing MMA right so that that", "04:28", "argument that conversation is completely", "04:30", "invalid like oh if you put this boxer in", "04:33", "against this Muay Thai fighter who's", "04:34", "going to win I don't know what rules are", "04:36", "they fighting under they're fighting", "04:37", "under multi roles each part going to get", "04:38", "crushed right you know I mean well it's", "04:40", "interesting that wonderboy Thompson is", "04:42", "going to fight tyron woodley who's the", "04:44", "UFC welterweight champion and who's is a", "04:46", "super powerful wrestler but he's also", "04:48", "training with Duke Rufus who's obviously", "04:50", "very talented knows a lot about more", "04:52", "time great coach um when you see a guy", "04:56", "like that what the reason why I keep", "04:58", "bringing up", "04:59", "wonderboy Stiles because it's so unique", "05:00", "you know we brought up Raymond Daniel's", "05:02", "in glory who's one of the only guys that", "05:04", "has like that similar background here", "05:06", "and then Michael Page of course in MMA", "05:08", "fights for Bellator has a very similar", "05:09", "style to that sport karate style what", "05:12", "are the holes in that style like what's", "05:14", "what's the pros and cons you see as well", "05:16", "as I might what we were speaking of", "05:18", "earlier it's it's if you've never", "05:21", "applied that in a fight a real fight", "05:24", "not-not-not points borrowing not not not", "05:27", "not that the kind of thing there's", "05:29", "certain techniques and things that are", "05:31", "completely worthless and unfortunately", "05:33", "in a lot of those sports you're not you", "05:37", "don't get exposed by that until it's way", "05:39", "too late so you're trying these", "05:40", "techniques that you know a decent person", "05:43", "just going to walk right through because", "05:44", "they look good and they're flashy and", "05:47", "they're great on the pads and in and all", "05:49", "that but but when you have to damage", "05:51", "someone right well obviously Thompson", "05:53", "knows how to do that though obviously", "05:54", "knows how to fight in its in its using", "05:56", "those techniques but applying them in a", "05:59", "more fight centric way and it's a", "06:02", "completely different thing but when you", "06:04", "see what I was trying to get at is that", "06:06", "such a weird style where he's down", "06:07", "sideways and he leaps in and out and he", "06:10", "moves back and forth from the waist like", "06:12", "a snake I mean he's got a lot of there's", "06:14", "a lot of weirdness yeah the way he moves", "06:16", "and it's it's very difficult to find", "06:18", "anybody that has that level skill with", "06:21", "sport karate kickboxing but also has a", "06:25", "really good wrestling base - yeah yeah", "06:27", "and I think that's one of the biggest", "06:28", "things and why he's able to apply those", "06:30", "things because because he can deal with", "06:33", "the wrestling and everything else that", "06:34", "goes in so so that's why you'll see him", "06:37", "throw those techniques because he's not", "06:38", "as worried about it as someone who", "06:39", "might be just as good as him with those", "06:41", "things in has zero grounder wrestling", "06:44", "what they're not going to throw because", "06:45", "I'm they're gonna get taken down crushed", "06:46", "yeah it's like we were talking about", "06:47", "your experience in a Taekwondo school", "06:50", "that you went there the first day start", "06:53", "doing sparring you threw a low kick and", "06:54", "then like get out of here get out of", "06:55", "here time to go yeah so you do it", "06:58", "something too effective yeah so being", "07:00", "able to apply things in a real fight and", "07:02", "being able to apply them in the air is", "07:04", "very different right obviously we see", "07:07", "Thompson can apply them in a real fight", "07:09", "yeah what is he doing that you see", "07:11", "that's different like me obviously is", "07:14", "not a Muay Thai fighter he's a kickboxer", "07:15", "but like when you see that stance that", "07:18", "weird stance at sideways stance think", "07:21", "about that oh I don't think much about", "07:23", "cuz I don't watched a lot of anime you", "07:25", "know I mean I do a little right I don't", "07:28", "I wouldn't say I follow it you know I", "07:29", "mean I watch when it's on and but I'm", "07:31", "not you know like paying attention to", "07:33", "the fighters or tracking them throughout", "07:35", "the years you know that much I'm just so", "07:38", "curious because you're so Muay Thai", "07:40", "you know your style so more time you're", "07:42", "obviously an expert at I'm always", "07:43", "curious as to like how a person like you", "07:45", "observes an expert striker in sort of", "07:49", "another realm well I think he's an", "07:51", "expert and he's become an expert striker", "07:53", "in MMA so he's he's applying all the", "07:56", "techniques that he known that he knows", "07:57", "and have worked for him in MMA so it's", "08:00", "different than if he would get in the", "08:02", "ring and do Muay Thai yeah how many", "08:04", "fighters like him have done more time", "08:06", "obviously Raymond Daniels has done", "08:08", "kickboxing and some you know in it but", "08:10", "it's another one of those things where", "08:12", "being able to apply the things from your", "08:15", "other sport into that it's so like we", "08:18", "were talking about with the Raymond", "08:20", "Daniel's and Nicky hold skin like he", "08:21", "just walked him down like bop bop", "08:24", "crushing the leg valtellina too so so at", "08:27", "a certain level it kind of you you lose", "08:31", "that like where you're you're spinning", "08:32", "flashy techniques are going to work", "08:34", "against you know those mid-level guys", "08:36", "but you put them in there with the best", "08:38", "in the world and a lot of that stuff", "08:40", "gets exposed in is not working out so", "08:42", "well and you you think that essentially", "08:45", "demonstrates the effectiveness of muy", "08:47", "Thai at the highest levels you think it", "08:49", "demonstrates the the holes and some of", "08:51", "the sting", "08:52", "and techniques um if I'm not flinching", "08:55", "on the things you do and don't really", "08:56", "care so much about you hopping around", "08:58", "and spin around I'm just walking down", "09:00", "crushing you mmm", "09:02", "you know that that's where that kind of", "09:04", "gets exposed so it's like it's like", "09:07", "putting a boxer into a muay thai if I", "09:09", "don't to do is kick your legs and you", "09:11", "can't punch me right I know I mean but", "09:12", "you take a boxer and teach them how to", "09:14", "defend though those kicks and stand in a", "09:16", "little bit more of a squared up way and", "09:19", "where I can't use you use your weakness", "09:21", "against you as much you're going to have", "09:23", "much better success even if you never", "09:24", "throw kick now you just can take those", "09:26", "kicks better and just kill me with your", "09:28", "high level hands", "09:34", "[Music]", "English
