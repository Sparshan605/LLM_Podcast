"Tyson the other day and he was trying to", "120:03", "explain to me escape velocity like then", "120:08", "he takes my shoe he goes let me see your", "120:10", "shoe he takes my shoe and he goes now if", "120:12", "I throw this up in there it's going to", "120:14", "come down but if I throw it hard enough", "120:16", "it will escape the pull of the gravity", "120:20", "of the earth and once it's free we'll go", "120:21", "on forever yeah that's fucking cool what", "120:25", "yeah like you try to like put that in", "120:28", "your head like wait a minute what goes", "120:31", "on forever isn't that the problem", "120:32", "now this sky this is great to just", "120:35", "dummies talking isn't this the problem", "120:37", "with the moon is that not the problem", "120:39", "with the moon but if you jump on the", "120:41", "moon you can escape the it's easier to", "120:44", "get out of the escape velocity of the", "120:46", "moon no it's 1/6 Earth's gravity oh", "120:48", "really yeah I thought oh he's not in the", "120:50", "mood you can you can theoretically you", "120:56", "can jump higher and if you believe in", "120:59", "NASA bro there's some videos of guys", "121:02", "jumping around on the moon yeah the", "121:03", "problem with the videos of people on the", "121:06", "moon is that there are videos that look", "121:09", "100% fake what guys fall forward and", "121:12", "looks like they get yanked up by wires", "121:14", "there's a lot of video that looks fake", "121:16", "as fuck I don't know if it's fake I", "121:19", "don't know if it just looked fake", "121:21", "because it's 1/6 the Earth's gravity and", "121:23", "we don't know what that really looks", "121:24", "like until you see it play out but", "121:25", "there's some videos of guys falling down",
