needed", "39:52", "to do a Pierce walked out and I'm", "39:54", "looking up and this media come for", "39:56", "and it was so bright that it actually", "39:58", "lit up the ground dude like the most",

like", "40:10", "it lasts for 25 minutes half an hour in", "40:12", "the in the camera and it's just drift", "40:14", "and changing shape in the atmosphere it", "40:16", "was insane Wow so it's just like every", "40:19", "now and then there's like a real good", "40:20", "one so then I started looking it up and", "40:22", "I seen one that wrecked a whole village", "40:24", "like in Germany or

"Randall Carlson put it best he said we", "40:44", "live in the middle of a shooting gallery", "40:46", "isn't it insane it's just the time the", "40:49", "perspective of you know hundreds of", "40:51", "millions of years it doesn't seem it", "40:54", "doesn't register yes because we're only", "40:56", "around for a hundred years yeah yeah", "40:57", "yeah so when we look up and we see the",

the earth yeah and I", "41:37", "started looking into that and then I", "41:39", "started really looking into Aborigines", "41:42", "in Australia indigenous how long they've", "41:43", "been around for and stuff like that and", "41:45", "there's now evidence to say that they've", "41:47", "been around for 70,000 years they live", "41:50", "through like three of those big medias", "41:52", "hitting the earth you know like it's", "41:54", "crazy to think about like why didn't we", "41:56", "she had video cameras back to him you", "41:58", "know and they could have recorded them", "41:59", "we could look at it now like imagine", "42:00", "that well Randall Carlson the guy that I", "42:03", "talked about earlier he is a proponent", "42:06", "of this theory that this is what ended", "42:08", "the Ice Age", "42:09", "and he's got some pretty compelling", "42:11", "evidence to back it up in terms of like", "42:16", "massive massive fields filled with dead", "42:20", "woolly mammoths and died almost", "42:21", "instantly some of them with their legs", "42:23", "broken from the force of the impact", "42:25", "yeah he's you know it's really", "42:28", "interesting because he's a guy who I", "42:30", "don't think he has a degree in this", "42:32", "stuff but he's so well-read in it that", "42:35", "he has these debates and conversations", "42:37", "with peoples that do have these degrees", "42:38", "in it and he can tell them things about", "42:40", "it yeah and it's hard in those fields to", "42:44", "be taken seriously if you don't have a", "42:45", "PhD and whatever disel and it is but man", "42:48", "his his work on these things is so", "42:52", "compelling in the podcast that I've did", "42:54", "with them are just mind-blowing but in", "42:56", "terms of like the evidence it points to", "42:58", "some event that ended the ice age very", "43:01", "rapidly and caused the disintegration of", "43:04", "the polar of the the ice that was over", "43:07", "North America you know North America had", "43:09", "something like a mile-high plus sheet of", "43:11", "ice over the list of it ten thousand", "43:13", "years ago I think I was driving through", "43:16", "Wyoming and they've got all these signs", "43:19", "up in Wyoming that are really", "43:21", "interesting and it was there's a rock", "43:22", "formation that'll tell you how old that",

it", "43:32", "rock like that you know all the lines", "43:34", "like this there's some of them there", "43:36", "that are like hundreds of million years", "43:39", "old you know and there's a sign there", "43:40", "showing it and it's just it's incredible", "43:42", "to think how much the earth changed and", "43:45", "you just said it we're around for a", "43:46", "hundred years at a time max yeah you", "43:48", "know and it's just like we're dropping", "43:51", "the freaking ocean like even the whole", "43:52", "human race is a drop in the ocean", "43:54", "compared to like how old the earth is", "43:57", "and it's just crazy to think of it like", "43:59", "it's hard to comprehend that there was", "44:01", "that much ice over here because there's", "44:02", "none now yeah you know

Australia though like", "55:24", "particularly there is hunting seems to", "55:26", "be on the rise yeah it's just not really", "55:29", "promoted well except for", "55:31", "you know the boning community itself", "55:33", "whereas you come to AmeriCorps and", "55:35", "there's like towns with big sign up", "55:38", "saying welcome hunters you know it's", "55:40", "promoted Italy yeah it's not it's like", "55:42", "it's not part of our history in", "55:44", "Australia even though it is signs that", "55:46", "say welcome hunter in America having a", "55:49", "scene there yeah yeah there's none of", "55:51", "that so I think it is on the rise you", "55:55", "know and I think there's like this bit", "55:57", "of a trend at the moment you know go and", "55:59", "kill your own which is good I love that", "56:02", "well so specially because Australia has", "56:04", "so many non-native species that you can", "56:06", "hunt exactly yeah and I mean you don't", "56:09", "ever have to buy meat in Australia no no", "56:11", "do you ever buy meat if we're eating", "56:13", "chicken yeah yeah that's about it but", "56:15", "just to mix it up yeah the fridge is", "56:17", "full I fill all my friends fridges my", "56:19", "family's fridges", "56:21", "speaking of chicken what's that mountain", "56:22", "lion tastes like fucking delicious", "56:24", "that's why I keep hearing it's delicious", "56:27", "yeah and people get angry it's so", "56:29", "strange to me how angry people get if", "56:32", "you kill a mountain lion yeah because I", "56:34", "think they think that if you kill it", "56:36", "it's different than killing a deer or", "56:38", "something that's a normal thing to eat", "56:40", "yeah even more than a bear yeah yeah", "56:43", "they get more angry so kitty cat yeah", "56:45", "yeah I mean while that motherfucker will", "56:47", "kill you yeah I had a bunch of people", "56:49", "saying you know you shouldn't have", "56:50", "killed or don't see mountain lions like", "56:52", "I see deer I'm fucking no shit cuz have", "56:54", "you seen mountain like lines like you've", "56:56", "seen deer there'd be no deer mm-hmm it's", "56:58", "as simple as that", "56:59", "you know I don't know what the numbers", "57:00", "are but there's probably supposed to be", "57:01", "like one mountain lion for every 500", "57:03", "deer or something like yeah when there's", "57:06", "one a day yeah that's right", "57:08", "and they're a snaky creature you know", "57:10", "you're not supposed to see them they're", "57:11", "not like that listen you you could go", "57:13", "your whole life not seeing them and they", "57:15", "could be around you all the time yeah", "57:17", "that's a fact that you live in the", "57:18", "wilderness if you live in Montana or you", "57:22", "live in Colorado and you live in the", "57:25", "woods you might see one every few years", "57:28", "yeah you might not yeah few years and", "57:32", "they'll fucking everywhere yeah I'll see", "57:33", "prints all the time but I'll never see a", "57:36", "cat like I've actually never seen a cat", "57:38", "in the wall except for the one that I", "57:39", "hunt", "57:40", "and that's like that story I was telling", "57:43", "you before like it was eating a calf but", "57:45", "they typically kill a deer every single", "57:47", "day yeah you know so it's fucking deer", "57:50", "this the human brain allows us to manage", "57:52", "things in a certain way you know it's", "57:54", "like these biologists have put all this", "57:56", "study and research in the you know gone", "57:58", "okay you can hunt males in this area so", "58:00", "that's all I could hunt where I was I", "58:02", "could only shoot a male how do you know", "58:04", "it's a male well that's when the dogs", "58:06", "come in handy so like I've always met", "58:09", "I've never really wanted to hunt with", "58:10", "dogs because I'd like to do all the", "58:11", "hunting myself but there's a special", "58:15", "bond between the hunter and the dogs", "58:16", "when you're hunting that's for sure and", "58:18", "it was actually a really good experience", "58:19", "I really loved it but a lot of people", "58:21", "frown on using dogs but the best way to", "58:23", "to determine the sexes is the dogs will", "58:27", "track it and the line will take refuge", "58:29", "in a tree and then you can have a look", "58:31", "at of genitals and make sure it's a male", "58:33", "with binoculars yeah yeah well sometimes", "58:36", "if they're low enough you can tell if", "58:37", "the human eye so the first thing we", "58:39", "established was well it was the line I", "58:42", "wanted the line that had killed that", "58:43", "calf or was eating that calf alive we", "58:45", "end up getting a getting the rancher to", "58:47", "come in the end up putting the calf out", "58:49", "of its misery it couldn't be saved and", "58:51", "then we put the dogs back on that", "58:53", "mountain lion track and they chased him", "58:55", "about seven miles and they end up", "58:57", "training we got we marched in and hiked", "59:00", "into the tree and up determining that it", "59:01", "was a male and then man up shooting and", "59:04", "it wasn't really good death it was quick", "59:06", "but um if it was a female would have had", "59:10", "to have left it where we were some", "59:11", "states aren't like that and counties", "59:13", "aren't like that where it can be male", "59:14", "and female the population is too high", "59:16", "what they're trying to do in that part", "59:18", "of Colorado is just keep that might", "59:21", "mountain lion population healthy and how", "59:23", "they determine that was by shooting", "59:25", "males only that could change next year", "59:27", "they could have a rise in mountain lion", "59:29", "a decrease in the mule deer and other", "59:31", "animals so they might change that again", "59:33", "but we could only shoot a male so yeah", "59:36", "the problem in America particularly in", "59:39", "California where they outlawed hunting", "59:42", "with dogs is that the perception of", "59:44", "using a dog to go after an animal the", "59:47", "perception is that it's not fair mm-hmm", "59:49", "what people I mean this is gonna be hard", "59:51", "for some people especially animal lovers", "59:52", "to understand", "59:53", "but that is the only effective way to", "59:57", "hunt for mountain lions because there's", "59:58", "no way you're gonna sneak up on them", "60:00", "you're just now that truck you're not", "60:01", "gonna see that's where numbers start to", "60:03", "bloom and other animals like mule deer", "60:05", "and stuff start the Plumber which i've", "60:07", "heard a lot that's happening in", "60:08", "california is the mule deer population", "60:10", "just been decimated because there's no", "60:12", "control on the mountain law exactly well", "60:14", "they do have control the mountain lions", "60:16", "but only government employees killed in", "60:18", "the mountain kill ironically the same", "60:21", "amount of mountain lions they were", "60:22", "killing when they were high he's insane", "60:24", "it's insane but instead of people paying", "60:27", "money to do it and getting retires back", "60:29", "in the conservation and getting to eat", "60:31", "the mountain lion which i know again", "60:33", "people like what are you talking about", "60:34", "eating mountain lion I'm telling you", "60:36", "folks", "60:36", "I haven't eaten one but I'm telling you", "60:39", "and you said it brunella said it's one", "60:41", "of the most delicious animals he's ever", "60:42", "eaten yeah I wanted to bring you some", "60:44", "but it's actually illegal to bring it in", "60:46", "to California good thing we always abide", "60:49", "by the law dramatically and then one day", "60:52", "I'll try it yeah so then I've cooked it", "60:57", "up and I'm feeding it to Kim yeah and I", "60:59", "was cooking chicken as well just in case", "61:01", "her and the kids didn't like it I had", "61:02", "chicken on the grill as well and I", "61:04", "served the mountain line first and now", "61:05", "we're eating the mountain lion and I'm", "61:07", "like what do you think of it and she's", "61:08", "like ice I've got the chicken and I'm", "61:10", "like no you don't you've got the", "61:12", "mountain lion and it was delicious dude", "61:14", "it's tenderized I felt like it was a", "61:17", "taste between like chicken and pork or", "61:21", "chicken and even venison like I found it", "61:24", "right in the middle there it's delicious", "61:25", "and I'm not saying everyone should go", "61:26", "and hunt a mountain line because you", "61:27", "can't do that but there's certain places", "61:29", "that you can go eat a tag for the", "61:31", "benefit of Wildlife and go on hunting me", "61:34", "on the line people just have a hard time", "61:35", "with the idea that you are somehow", "61:39", "another helping to control the", "61:40", "population by killing an animal that", "61:43", "kills other animals yeah yeah they would", "61:47", "rather let nature take its course but", "61:49", "what so even if like like let's go to", "61:51", "Africa now even if the lion population", "61:54", "way outweighed something and was running", "61:57", "it to extinction these people would want", "61:59", "to see it back and just let that happen", "62:00", "and it's like humans have got a brain", "62:04", "capacity that allows us to study input", "62:06", "research into an animal", "62:07", "that's like actually what would be more", "62:09", "healthier for the whole ecosystem would", "62:12", "be if we come in and hunt these animals", "62:13", "and what we'll do is we'll charge people", "62:16", "a certain tag fee to be able to do that", "62:18", "and we'll put that back into", "62:19", "conservation which will help this animal", "62:21", "and there's just this beautiful healthy", "62:23", "ball that keeps turning yeah for the", "62:25", "people that know it they respect it and", "62:27", "they appreciate it you know people like", "62:28", "backcountry hunters and anglers and all", "62:31", "these different organizations Rocky", "62:32", "Mountain Elk Federation a lot of", "62:33", "different organizations they have the", "62:34", "United States that really appreciate", "62:37", "what they're doing to promote that that", "62:40", "that idea here in America but people", "62:43", "that don't hunt and don't don't go into", "62:45", "them it took me years to kind of wrap my", "62:48", "head around it and really truly", "62:49", "understand it and become educated yeah", "62:51", "as to how it works a wildlife biologist", "62:53", "set these standards and do it based on", "62:55", "healthy populations and how much time", "62:57", "they spend doing surveys and analyzing", "62:59", "the population how important it is to", "63:01", "you know that these reports and hunters", "63:04", "send in to wildlife organizations and", "63:06", "the Department of Fish and Game", "63:08", "it's really interesting and I'm not a", "63:10", "blanket killer even because I understand", "63:12", "where those people are coming from as", "63:14", "well yeah we need a certain amount of", "63:16", "that because it could go the opposite", "63:17", "way where it's like let's just go out", "63:19", "and hunt everything can right not the", "63:20", "case if something's not in a good", "63:22", "healthy population I'm not interested in", "63:23", "hunting that overall myself of course", "63:25", "ya know I want to see these animals stay", "63:27", "here for forever I want my kids kids", "63:28", "kids kids to be able to see those", "63:31", "animals in good healthy healthy", "63:32", "population", "63:33", "yeah like when I hear about limited", "63:35", "entry tags for like like for moose or", "63:38", "something like that because a small", "63:39", "number and they'll let a certain amount", "63:41", "of people whoa what fuck yeah what is a", "63:49", "tally", "63:50", "no I'm a slob that's why the towels here", "63:53", "I fucking spill everything I've ruined", "63:55", "two laptop at least right at least two", "63:57", "laptops during the show it's angry", "64:00", "that's like it's angry", "64:01", "America's dangerous yes fucking kombucha", "64:07", "if I found out like like in some places", "64:10", "they have a small amount of moose and", "64:12", "they'll let you hunt a moose but it has", "64:16", "to be like one moose and has to be over", "64:18", "50 inches and like I'm out", "64:20", "yeah I don't want to shoot that moose", "64:22", "how many of them are there there's 200", "64:24", "of them walk out of here my shoot not", "64:25", "interested no what if what if the winter", "64:27", "comes and kills a bunch of a fight which", "64:29", "happens what if wolves move in happy yes", "64:32", "and that's why these tag limits and that", "64:36", "change from year to year as well like", "64:37", "I've seen them constantly change because", "64:39", "they'll do their research or the kill", "64:41", "wasn't big enough last year all the", "64:43", "winner was too harsh and you know they", "64:44", "start limited in tags yeah that's very", "64:46", "sad think in most cases in most cases", "64:49", "we've got it right yeah I think so too", "64:52", "which is one of the reasons why one of", "64:54", "my favorite places to hunt is alone I", "64:59", "fucking see little demons that just jump", "65:02", "out why arrow is constantly it's crazy", "65:05", "of an animal that evolved to get away", "65:07", "from Tigers you can't believe how fast", "65:09", "those guys and delicious yeah you think", "65:13", "it's a it's it's kind of a weird", "65:15", "coincidence that the fastest animal you", "65:17", "can hunt is also the most delicious yeah", "65:19", "totally yeah yeah yeah like it's kind of", "65:22", "weird", "65:23", "yeah because they are delicious they", "65:25", "learn to move faster I think a deer so", "65:28", "you know we say jump the string like", "65:30", "when you shoot like the deer here's the", "65:31", "bow go off or something like that and we", "65:33", "call the jump the string which you'll", "65:34", "know about this but a lot of people want", "65:36", "they don't jump out of the string when", "65:38", "they miss your arrow that actually drop", "65:40", "to bound away so they drop load up their", "65:43", "legs and then Jen jump you know but it's", "65:46", "actually the drop that's when you", "65:47", "usually miss them", "65:48", "well that moves at over 1,300 feet per", "65:51", "second a really good bow shoots at about", "65:54", "300 feet per second in a hunting", "65:55", "situation so you can't beat them", "65:58", "1313 hundred feet per second that's how", "66:01", "fast they start dropping", "66:02", "that's insane yeah well the thing about", "66:05", "access deer as opposed to any other", "66:06", "animal I've ever hunted is they don't", "66:08", "just jump the string they get out of the", "66:10", "way yeah like a whole body link their", "66:12", "guns like yeah like you have to date", "66:15", "they have to not know you're there yeah", "66:17", "yeah like the first one that I killed", "66:19", "this season had no idea was there no", "66:22", "idea no idea was there and there's a", "66:23", "nice wind so when that arrow hit him he", "66:26", "was quartering away when that hit him he", "66:27", "had no idea it was coming", "66:29", "and yeah the perfect yeah it was", "66:30", "our trip or do that one yeah that was", "66:32", "when I got out of the car and I saw 115", "66:35", "minutes don't ya big velvet head yeah", "66:37", "yeah so I try and it's the same with", "66:40", "fellow deer back in Australia like", "66:41", "they're really fast off the mark I'll", "66:44", "try and shoot him when they're

would be in", "96:14", "hire or people paying to go hunt them", "96:16", "some of these towns leave off hunters", "96:18", "like that any reason that town is there", "96:20", "like all their income is hunters coming", "96:22", "in and hunting these destinations and", "96:24", "that's the reason why the animals are", "96:26", "there in the first place", "96:26", "yeah in Newseum yeah that's right", "96:28", "zealand they were all introduced as by", "96:30", "wealthy Europeans they wanted to make it", "96:32", "like a hunting distance yes that's right", "96:34", "it is so crazy they just threw a bunch", "96:35", "of yeah this is our playground yeah", "96:38", "what's up fuck yeah well New Zealand's", "96:40", "happy for now because they've got", "96:41", "something hunting they got game animals", "96:42", "yeah but if they're truly causing that", "96:45", "much damage then yes obviously like fin", "96:47", "out the population but why not get", "96:49", "hunters involved to do it why not", "96:50", "no hunting you know where the meat gets", "96:52", "used you know with it where it's done", "96:54", "properly and you know benefits the", "96:55", "communities and well there's a lot of", "96:57", "hunting destinations in New Zealand", "96:59", "where people go to that are high fence", "97:01", "places which is a little weird yeah like", "97:03", "just I mean even if it's a couple", "97:05", "hundred acres or a couple days they're", "97:07", "fenced in and that animals aren't going", "97:08", "it's just different it's like what we're", "97:10", "talking about before where there's like", "97:11", "shallow fun yeah like oh I've never done", "97:14", "it but see that as like a shallow fun", "97:16", "and then there's meaningful funds", "97:17", "fucking what walk them out and find your", "97:20", "own spot yeah you know well be axel", "97:22", "actually go into the wild don't fence", "97:25", "the wild in and make it the knot while", "97:27", "don't make it the drastic the hard bit", "97:30", "the hard bit about saying that you're a", "97:32", "cock rate if you do it is a benefit some", "97:34", "wildlife like this oh yes yelling shit", "97:37", "that have been", "97:38", "walk back from the concern list or", "97:40", "nearly extinction because of all I fence", "97:41", "operations like in Texas and Africa", "97:43", "oh yeah so it's like I suppose it has", "97:46", "got its place but it's just there's", "97:48", "different there's different sorts of", "97:49", "hunters well there's also different", "97:51", "sizes of these partitions so like if", "97:55", "you're in a place like there's some", "97:56", "places in Texas that are 10,000 acres", "97:58", "like look that's so far beyond that", "98:01", "animals wild range that you might as", "98:04", "well be in a wild even if there's a", "98:06", "fence you know 80 miles in that", "98:08", "direction what the fuck are you ever", "98:09", "gonna get to that family or a deer", "98:11", "you're going to yeah it's true I think", "98:14", "I'm maybe I'm a little bit Chloe's more", "98:15", "than it's a it's like ideologically the", "98:19", "same thing I agree with you it feels", "98:20", "I've you know I've seen those places it", "98:23", "seems weird yeah it's like Jurassic Park", "98:25", "you go these giant gates and inside", "98:27", "those animals are fenced in they're", "98:28", "never getting out yeah yeah you know", "98:30", "they're in there yeah there's no mystery", "98:31", "no there's no mystery that's yeah and I", "98:34", "like I like the file you're in

"99:09", "I like that value because it makes you", "99:11", "realize how fucking awesome it is when", "99:13", "you get something well it also it's", "99:14", "different between hunting and any other", "99:17", "way that you get meat because because it", "99:20", "is so difficult and it requires skill", "99:23", "planning intelligence you have to have", "99:27", "knowledge you have to know
