probably not right", "06:29", "okay okay", "06:29", "because beginning in the 1600s we", "06:34", "learned that our senses", "06:36", "are not only they not only fool us they", "06:43", "and occasionally don't work they're not", "06:46", "all that the universe tells us is that", "06:52", "they are not they don't have the", "06:54", "capacity to recognize all that's going", "06:58", "on in

you had the invention of the", "07:10", "microscope and you had the invention of", "07:12", "the telescope this is really the first", "07:15", "steps to enhance our senses beyond what", "07:21", "our human biology endowed us with and", "07:24", "upon doing so we discovered things about", "07:28", "the world that were previously oblivious", "07:31", "to us we discovered nose farts", "07:33", "when Louie when leuwen Hoch brought his", "07:37", "telescope of his microscope to a drop of", "07:41", "pond water and saw what were called", "07:44", "anima cul\u00e9s what else were you going to",

"07:59", "previously no one had any idea was there", "08:02", "and my point is beginning in 1600 and", "08:05", "with an ever improving march forward the", "08:09", "methods and tools of science have served", "08:11", "to enhance our senses increase our", "08:14", "senses increase the range of our senses", "08:17", "but more importantly give us whole kinds", "08:21", "of senses that your five senses could", "08:24", "have never even imagined that our human", "08:26", "biology couldn't even approximate so as", "08:31", "so so what's an example yeah we don't", "08:36", "have senses to detect magnetic field at", "08:39", "all that's why you can sit in an MRI", "08:42", "chamber and sit there in you know", "08:44", "whistle Dixie and you'll have no idea", "08:47", "the strength of the magnetic field", "08:49", "that's being cast across", "08:50", "your body we don't have sensors for it", "08:51", "you don't have sensors for radio or", "08:54", "radio waves well the difference there is", "08:59", "we do have sensors for one aspect of the", "09:02", "electromagnetic spectrum we have sensors", "09:04", "for infrared visible and a delayed sense", "09:09", "for ultraviolet sent me oh wow that's", "09:12", "pretty loud and a creative ringtone just", "09:14", "like mine yeah and learn that ghosts", "09:16", "aren't dangerous he goes old yeah yeah", "09:19", "so so the point is the
