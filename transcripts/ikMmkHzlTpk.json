question is though here's my", "12:13", "take on it and this is it's one of the", "12:16", "most human subjects and that being", "12:19", "meaning that it's messy humans are messy", "12:22", "like there's good and there's bad you", "12:24", "know look like abortion is a messy", "12:26", "subject it's messy you know whether you", "12:29", "have the whether you agree with", "12:30", "someone's right to have it or not it is", "12:33", "what you're doing is especially as the", "12:36", "fetus gets older it's messy you know", "12:40", "when it's a complicated discussion it's", "12:42", "not a

you're not allowed to do them", "12:51", "but they exist for a reason the reason", "12:54", "why they exist is they're really", "12:56", "effective they're really effective at", "12:58", "enhancing your body but how much of that", "13:00", "will we allow we allow creatine we allow", "13:03", "supplements in terms of you know there's", "13:06", "there's certain things that can slightly", "13:09",

yeah and so I have", "13:28", "to go back a little bit and disagree", "13:30", "with you on something so in terms of", "13:32", "fighting being dangerous and that's if", "13:34", "we want it to fit things that are", "13:36", "dangerous for you would forbid fighting", "13:38", "I think the main thing you're doing can", "13:41", "be dangerous I mean the main thing that", "13:43", "we're talking about the sport the the", "13:46", "combat event that can be dangerous", "13:48", "because that is what we watch to people", "13:51", "at the height of their skill ability", "13:53", "heart passion putting their life at risk", "13:57", "that can be dangerous but the", "13:59", "supplementation around it the way to", "14:01", "make it to make their training better", "14:04", "more effective that can't be dangerous", "14:07", "and I thought that can't be named can", "14:09", "yet to be dangerous so I thought", "14:11", "steroids were considered what sort of", "14:13", "band because abuses lead to long-term", "14:17", "damage to health now we see steroids is", "14:20", "cheating mm-hmm but it was banned", "14:23", "initially because it has detrimental", "14:25", "effects I don't think that's true it's", "14:27", "not no because there's no real evidence", "14:28", "that it's detrimental it's not as", "14:30", "detrimental as alcohol when you allow", "14:32", "people to drink but even a bit even when", "14:34", "abused where the body's like there's", "14:36", "there's not a lot but like there's a", "14:38", "great documentary on it called bigger", "14:39", "stronger faster and it's by my friend", "14:42", "Chris Bell and when you watch that", "14:45", "documentary and you realize like oh well", "14:47", "the real negative consequences of taking", "14:51", "steroids or that it shuts down your", "14:53", "endocrine system so it stops your body's", "14:55", "natural production of testosterone and", "14:58", "growth hormone and hormones that's the", "15:01", "real problem and for

shuts down but as far as", "15:13", "like death boy I mean there's people are", "15:17", "prescribed pain pills every day of the", "15:19", "week and fighters that are on injuries", "15:21", "that have been you know that have gotten", "15:24", "surgery they were they're prescribed", "15:25", "pain pills every day of the week and", "15:27", "those pain pills kill people left and", "15:29",

I'm being pretty", "15:41", "objective and neutral about this but I'm", "15:42", "just looking at it like it is a it's a", "15:45", "very messy subject yeah it's very", "15:46", "eloquently put but so so your problem in", "15:49", "terms of damaging the opponent is if one", "15:52", "side takes there wasn't exactly what", "15:54", "happens if both the problem is you would", "15:56", "require someone do that", "15:58", "maybe someones a holistic person they", "15:59", "don't want to introduce any unnatural", "16:02", "exogenous steroids into their body and", "16:06", "hormones into their

that's a real argument for the Tour", "16:45", "de France the Tour de France they say", "16:47", "that you actually are better off and", "16:49", "healthier taking steroids yeah and EPO", "16:52",

don't know how to quit really", "18:18", "yeah I'm like I do a lot of stuff like", "18:20", "that like stupid like I ran yesterday I", "18:23", "couldn't sleep I ran in here yesterday", "18:25", "13

actually want to talk", "19:07", "about this a bead fight cuz I'm I'm", "19:09", "Russian so I loved the Russian way yeah", "19:12", "but I also love the I mean Kyle to me", "19:14", "represents like the American he's like", "19:16", "the Rocky", "19:17", "if you if you remember that fight with", "19:18", "against the third round he was winning I", "19:21", "mean that's the know the best of what",

it", "19:35", "beat had broken his hand broke his hand", "19:37", "somewhere I think in the second round so", "19:39", "he was pretty compromised going into", "19:40", "that third round couldn't really fire", "19:42", "back and Kyle's just has zero quit in", "19:45", "them there's an animal yeah I mean", "19:47", "that's the most beautiful you talk about", "19:48", "like technical fights in the ground or", "19:50", "technical striking like when like two", "19:52", "technicians throw everything away this", "19:55", "I'm sorry but that's what is the I love", "19:58", "the most about any kind of fighting any", "20:00", "kind of sport I enjoyed in the MoMA", "20:02", "I discourage it heavily I don't think", "20:05", "it's a smart way to fight yeah well then", "20:07", "I get it that's probably your job well", "20:09", "it's not just my job it's like what I", "20:11", "like", "20:11", "like I get I get the impulse but I don't", "20:16", "want people to give in to that impulse",

out", "21:39", "all his skill and technique and just", "21:41", "swing for the bleachers in the middle of", "21:43", "the Octagon it was a fun moment it was", "21:45", "great to watch but the idea that that", "21:47", "was the greatest moments life is for a", "21:49", "crazy person yeah there's moments in", "21:51", "sports they're just magic Olympics bring", "21:53", "that when like the thing that you don't", "21:56", "think should happen or can't possibly", "21:57", "happen or is not wise would people just", "22:00", "throw everything away you know you like", "22:01", "that yeah you're a passion person yeah", "22:04", "action person yeah for sure that's an", "22:06", "interesting thing for someone who", "22:08", "studies artificial intelligence I mean", "22:10", "if anybody listen

at you", "24:28", "the smartphone so they're better at", "24:31", "texting and driving", "24:32", "no the better balancing that now this is", "24:35", "a horrible thing to do so if you listen",

of exams", "26:32", "quite a few those of course it's like", "26:35", "hard to prove exactly what happened and", "26:37", "where the auto powers involved just like", "26:38", "on the flip side it's

thing is distracted", "27:40", "driving", "27:40", "yeah put your phone down I agree um", "27:44", "listen to some music some classic rock", "27:47", "classic really into yeah yeah click", "27:50",

good you're a black belt too", "28:28", "I'm sure you good yeah I'm not world", "28:30", "class and I'm always fucking me up", "28:32", "I'm a three-strike purple belt guitar ah", "28:34", "that's a good way of putting it yeah", "28:36", "yeah I see that what about hunting I'm", "28:37", "like a blue belt in hunting yeah yeah", "28:39", "yeah I've been doing it like I got the", "28:42", "purple belt by doing it a long time", "28:44", "mm-hmm as opposed to being amazing did", "28:46", "you take lessons no I learned everything", "28:49", "myself I have a couple of videos online", "28:51", "me playing comfortably numb' did you", "28:53", "learn", "28:53", "from watching videos or did you learn", "28:56", "from books like how did you like let me", "28:57", "see this give me this look at you yeah", "29:07", "it's there it probably won't pick it up", "29:09", "and if it picks it up it'll be to my", "29:11", "channel and I'll be short yeah it's me", "29:14", "playing it's so good it sounds a lot of", "29:18", "people from humming song freeze yeah so", "29:20", "this is this is it no I did not but this", "29:23", "thing get blocked if you were humming a", "29:25", "song yeah and then someone made a claim", "29:27", "on that song it would block our YouTube", "29:30", "like literally we could get D monetized", "29:32", "and put we we lose our streaming will be", "29:35", "lots of things will happen", "29:36", "lots of things like we've we've gotten", "29:40", "flagged for watching something on the", "29:43", "screen picture and picture no sound", "29:46", "commenting on it and we get flagged and", "29:48", "they want all the advertising revenue", "29:50", "from a three hour show for five ten", "29:53", "seconds of a video it's a slightly", "29:54", "broken system oh it's broken but there's", "29:57", "a lot of scam artists too", "29:58", "so I played another song Black Betty oh", "30:01", "yeah and I got I don't know yeah I", "30:04", "played the damn song but they they said", "30:07", "it was it wasn't they did exactly that", "30:09", "oh they said it was the RAM jam or what", "30:12", "everyone said it was there and I may", "30:15", "have borrowed the beat behind it from", "30:17", "them I'm not sure I just don't know", "30:20", "yeah well that's what I was thinking", "30:21", "about that song like it sounded like", "30:23", "there was other shit going on besides", "30:24", "just your guitar mmm oh no that's all me", "30:28", "real it's all made bad the bad we hear", "30:31", "that again that's really good man it", "30:33", "sound good", "30:33", "that's a great fucking song too", "30:35", "comfortably numb' know the scariest", "30:36", "thing for me what to play guitar on this", "30:39", "podcast so it's like going back and", "30:41", "forth oh really I do it said didn't that", "30:43", "do it actually play play play no it was", "30:45", "only a few people that have ever played", "30:46", "play ever last been and Suzanne from", "30:50", "honey honey", "30:51", "Gary Clark didn't write and he just came", "30:52", "out and talked and brought his guitar", "30:54", "I wanted to play Hendrix here really", "30:57", "yeah live what you got it right with you", "31:00", "right now", "31:00", "no I in the tar yeah well no I meant I", "31:03", "was okay sure in the future now I'm not", "31:06", "promise", "31:07", "skin you wear a Hendrix wig with the", "31:10", "bandana is that racially insensitive", "31:12", "though you're allowed to know Joe I will", "31:16", "not take my face", "31:18", "you're allowed okay the hair is like", "31:20", "just you know it's just hair is this not", "31:22", "you can't wear dreadlocks though yes of", "31:25", "those rules but I think you have all the", "31:31", "rules though right it's well he's the", "31:34", "goat you know of guitar players", "31:37", "that's the goat doesn't them you know", "31:39", "the reason why this call this shows", "31:41", "called Aryans yeah yeah it's I stole it", "31:43", "from Jimi Hendrix yeah what's my I don't", "31:47", "remember if we brought this up last time", "31:48", "but I just remembered to see in this", "31:49", "video or you're playing guitar while you", "31:51", "were driving yep well you shouldn't do", "31:52", "that dude it was the reason why it was", "31:55", "doing it why are you doing this on a", "31:57", "test track Oh what kind of car is that", "31:59", "looks like a Lincoln Lincoln MKZ yes sir", "32:02", "oh they do that the Lincoln's do that we", "32:04", "converted it and we that's the our code", "32:07", "controlling the car Wow you know that is", "32:10", "crazy so you converted this car to drive", "32:14", "autonomously honestly Wow and what what", "32:19", "exactly do you have to do to a car to", "32:22", "change like because that car does not", "32:25", "have the capacity to do anything like", "32:28", "that so the right my correct no no no", "32:31", "absolutely not but you are absolutely", "32:33", "correct the there's the first part is", "32:37", "being able to control the car with a", "32:38", "computer which is converting it to be", "32:40", "drive by wire so you can control the", "32:42", "steering and the break in the", "32:43", "acceleration to basically be able to", "32:45", "control with a joystick and then you", "32:47", "have to put laser sensors all around the", "32:50", "cars that we can find a sensor and", "32:52", "software so what's the best kind of", "32:54", "sensor the optical laser a lot of debate", "32:56", "on this and this is the big this is the", "32:58", "Throwdown between Elon Musk and", "33:00", "everybody else oh you know musk says the", "33:02", "best sensors camera everybody else well", "33:05", "everybody else says that at this time", "33:08", "lidar which are these lasers yes is the", "33:10", "best sensor so I'm more on the side in", "33:15", "this case on camera Anil musk so here's", "33:18", "the difference lasers are more precise", "33:20", "they work better", "33:21", "in poor lighting conditions that are", "33:23", "more reliable you can actually build", "33:25", "safe systems today that use lidar the", "33:29", "problem is that they don't have very", "33:32", "much information so we use our eyes to", "33:34", "drive and a camera is the same thing and", "33:38", "they have just a lot more information so", "33:41", "if you're going to build artificial", "33:42", "intelligence systems so the machine", "33:44", "learning systems that learn from huge", "33:45", "amounts of data camera is the way to go", "33:47", "because you can learn so much more you", "33:49", "can see so much more so the the richer", "33:52", "deeper sensor is camera but it's much", "33:56", "harder you have to collect a huge amount", "33:58", "of data it's a little bit more", "33:59", "futuristic so it's longer-term solution", "34:01", "so today to build a safe vehicle you", "34:04", "have to go lidar tomorrow however you", "34:07", "define tomorrow", "34:08", "he almost says this in a year others say", "34:10", "it's 5 10 20 years camera is the way to", "34:13", "go", "34:13", "mmm that's that's the the hard debate", "34:16", "and there's a lot of other debates but", "34:17", "that's one of the core ones it's", "34:19", "basically four camera you if you go", "34:22", "camera like you're doing the Tesla", "34:23", "there's seven cameras in your Tesla", "34:25", "mm-hmm", "34:26", "three looking forward there's all around", "34:28", "so on one looking inside no you have the", "34:31", "Model S yeah yeah so that that one", "34:33", "doesn't have a camera that's look inside", "34:34", "so it's all all cameras plus radar and", "34:38", "ultrasonic sensors that approach", "34:41", "requires collecting huge amounts of data", "34:43", "and they're doing that they drove now", "34:45", "about 1.3 billion miles under autopilot", "34:49", "Jesus yes it's it's a very large amount", "34:53", "of data so you're talking about over", "34:55", "five hundred thousand vehicles have", "34:57", "autopilot 450 I think thousand have the", "35:03", "new version of autopilot autopilot two", "35:05", "which is the one you're driving and all", "35:07", "of that is data so all of those all the", "35:10", "edge cases what they call them all the", "35:11", "difficult situations that occur is", "35:14", "feeding the machine learning system to", "35:17", "become better and better and better and", "35:19", "the open question is how much better", "35:22", "doesn't need to get to get to the human", "35:24", "level performance like one of the big", "35:27", "thing one of the", "35:30", "big assumptions human beings is that we", "35:32", "think that driving is actually pretty", "35:34", "easy and we think that humans suck at", "35:37", "driving those two assumptions we think", "35:39", "like driving it you know you stay in the", "35:41", "lane you style for the stop sign it's", "35:43", "pretty easy to automate and then the", "35:45", "other one is you think like humans are", "35:48", "terrible drivers and so it'll be easy to", "35:51", "build a machine that outperforms humans", "35:53", "are driving now there's that's uh I", "35:56", "think there's a lot of flaws behind that", "35:58", "intuition we take for granted how hard", "36:01", "it is to look at the scene like", "36:03", "everything you just did picked up moved", "36:05", "around some objects it's really", "36:08", "difficult to build an artificial", "36:09", "intelligence system that does that to be", "36:11", "able to perceive and understand the",

question is did the", "39:38", "person was the person paying attention", "39:40", "and was there enough time given for the", "39:42", "person to take over and if they were", "39:44", "paying attention to catch the vehicle", "39:46", "steer back onto the road hmm as far as I", "39:50", "believe the only information they have", "39:53", "is hands on steering wheel and they were", "39:56", "saying that", "39:57", "like half that's half the minute leading", "39:59", "up to the crash the hands weren't on the", "40:02", "steering wheel or something like that", "40:03", "basically trying to infer

far as I know", "40:14", "again so the the question is this is the", "40:18", "eyes on the road thing because I think", "40:20", "I've heard you on a podcast saying", "40:21", "you're tempted to sort of look off the", "40:23", "road with your new Tesla or at least", "40:26", "become a little bit complacent that's", "40:28", "the yeah we're worried the worries that", "40:29", "you you just rely on the thing that you", "40:32", "would relax too much but what would that", "40:34", "relaxation lead to that the problem is", "40:37", "if something happened if you weren't you", "40:39", "know when you're driving I mean we've", "40:42", "discussed this many times on the podcast", "40:44", "that the reason why people have road", "40:46", "rage one of the reasons is because", "40:48", "you're in a heightened state because", "40:50", "cars are flying around you in your brain", "40:52", "is prepared to make split-second", "40:54", "decisions and moves and the worry is", "40:57", "that you would

that you get really used to it", "41:07", "just driving around for you so the", "41:09", "question is what be what happens when", "41:11", "you get used to it yeah you start", "41:13", "looking off-road dstyle texting more do", "41:15", "you start watching a movie etc right", "41:17", "that that's a that's a really an open", "41:18", "question and the like for example we", "41:22", "just did it the study published a study", "41:25", "from MIT on what people in our data set", "41:30", "with will collect this data set of 300", "41:32", "thousand miles in Tesla some instruments", "41:34",

situations is situations where", "42:05", "you have to immediately respond like", "42:07", "drifting out of lane if there's a", "42:08", "stopped car in front so on", "42:10", "the question is are people paying", "42:12", "attention during those moments so in our", "42:14", "data set they were paying attention they", "42:16", "were still remaining vigilant now in our", "42:19", "data set the

"misbehaving so you don't over trust it", "42:47", "you don't become too complacent the open", "42:50", "question is when it becomes better and", "42:51", "better and better and better will you", "42:54", "start becoming complacent when it drives", "42:56", "on the highway for an hour an hour and a", "42:58", "half and is opposed to 9.2 miles make", "43:01", "that 50 miles 60 miles do you start to", "43:04", "over trust it and that's a really open", "43:06", "question do you think or do you", "43:09", "anticipate a time and anywhere in the", "43:11", "near future where you won't have to", "43:13", "correct you will allow the car to do it", "43:16", "because the car will be perfect the car", "43:19", "first of all will never be perfect nor", "43:21", "will ever be perfect

you work in", "43:32", "AI like what makes you think that that's", "43:36", "impossible to achieve well let's let's", "43:40", "talk because because you're using the", "43:41", "word perfection I think perfect okay", "43:42", "that's a bad word yeah so you're I guess", "43:45", "you're a but let me see will it achieve", "43:47", "because people are obviously not perfect", "43:49", "will achieve a state of competence that", "43:52", "exceeds the human being and let's put it", "43:58", "in a dark way competence measured by", "44:01", "fatal crashes yes yes I absolutely", "44:05", "believe so and perhaps in the near term", "44:08", "near-term oh yeah five years yeah for me", "44:11", "five ten years is near term for Elon in", "44:15", "Elon Musk time that's converted to one", "44:19", "year have you met him", "44:20", "yes interviewed him recently fascinating", "44:23", "cat right", "44:24", "yep got a lot of weird shit bouncing", "44:26", "around behind those eyeballs you don't", "44:28", "realize until you talk to him in person", "44:30", "you're like oh you got a lot going on in", "44:32", "there man yeah there's this passion", "44:34", "there's Drive I mean it's one of the", "44:36", "hurricane of ideas yeah and focus and", "44:42", "confidence mm-hmm I mean the thing is", "44:45", "and a lot of the things he does which I", "44:48", "admire greatly from any man

it right that makes people", "46:40", "really uncomfortable why does it make", "46:41", "them uncomfortable because the way in", "46:43", "the automotive sector you test the", "46:45", "system mmm you you come up with a design", "46:48", "of the car every component and then you", "46:50", "go through like really rigorous testing", "46:52", "before it ever hits the road I here's an", "46:55", "idea from the Tesla side is where they", "46:58", "basically they in shadow mode test the", "47:01", "software but then they just release it", "47:03", "so essentially the drivers become the", "47:06", "testing mm-hmm and then they regularly", "47:08", "update it to to to adjust a if any", "47:12", "issues arise that makes people", "47:14", "uncomfortable because there's not a", "47:16",

"47:47", "doing what's made Silicon Valley", "47:49", "successful so updating regularly", "47:52", "aggressively innovating on the software", "47:54", "side so your Tesla over-the-air while", "47:57", "we're sitting here could get a totally", "47:58", "new update remember the flip of a bit as", "48:02", "a llama says it can be you can gain all", "48:06", "new capabilities that's really exciting", "48:09", "but that's also dangerous and that that", "48:12", "balance we what's dangerous about it let", "48:15", "it be faulty software faulty a bug so if", "48:18", "your your the apps on your phone you", "48:21", "know fail all the time where as a", "48:23", "society used to software failing we just", "48:27", "kind of reboot the device where we start", "48:29", "the app a most complex software

thorough", "48:45", "complete testing proving that the", "48:47", "software is safe is nearly impossible on", "48:49", "most software systems", "48:51", "that that's a that's nerve-wracking to a", "48:55", "lot of people because this that there's", "48:59", "no way to prove that the new software", "49:01", "update is safe so what it what is the", "49:04", "process like do you know like how they", "49:07", "create software they update it and then", "49:11", "they test it on something how much", "49:12", "testing do they do and what how much do", "49:15", "they do before they upload it to your", "49:16", "car yeah so I don't have any insider", "49:19", "information but I have a lot of sort of", "49:20", "public available information which is", "49:23", "they they test the software in shadow", "49:26", "mode meaning they see how the new", "49:29", "software compares to the current", "49:32", "software by running it in parallel on", "49:34", "the cars and seeing if there's", "49:35", "disagreements if like seeing if there's", "49:38", "any major disagreements and bringing", "49:40", "those up and seeing what by parallel I'm", "49:42", "sorry do you mean both programs running", "49:45", "at the same time one the original of the", "49:49", "es at the same time the original update", "49:51", "actually controlling the car mm-hmm and", "49:53", "the new update is just

and so that's", "50:07", "that's a really powerful way of testing", "50:08", "I think the software infrastructure that", "50:11", "Tesla's built a loss for that and I", "50:14", "think other companies should do the same", "50:16", "that's a really exciting powerful way to", "50:18", "approach not just automation not just", "50:22", "the time most vehicles or semi", "50:23", "autonomous vehicles but just safety is", "50:25", "basically all the data that's on cars", "50:28", "bring it back to a central point to", "50:32", "where you can use the edge cases all the", "50:34", "weird situations in

is most of it is", "50:57", "pretty boring nothing interesting", "50:59", "happens so they have automated ways of", "51:02", "extracting again what are called", "51:04", "cases so these weird moments of driving", "51:07", "and once you have these weird moments", "51:09", "they have people annotate it I don't", "51:12", "know what the number is but a lot of", "51:13", "companies are doing this it's in the", "51:15", "hundreds and the thousands basically if", "51:17", "humans annotate the data to see what", "51:19", "happened but most of what they're trying", "51:21", "to do is to automate that annotation so", "51:25", "to figure out how the debt date it can", "51:28", "be automatically used to improve the", "51:30", "system so they have they have methods", "51:32", "for that because it's a huge amount of", "51:34", "data and I think in the recent autonomy", "51:37", "Day a couple of weeks ago at this big", "51:39", "autonomy day where they demonstrated the", "51:41", "vehicle driving itself on a particular", "51:44", "stretch of road they they showed off", "51:47", "that you know they're able to query the", "51:49", "data basically ask questions of the data", "51:51", "saying the the example they gave is", "51:54", "there's a bike on the back of a car the", "51:56", "bicycle in the back of a car and they're", "51:58", "able to say well when the bicycle is in", "52:01", "the back of a car that's not a bicycle", "52:02", "that's just the part of the car and", "52:04", "they're able to now look back into the", "52:07", "data and find all the other cases the", "52:09", "thousands of cases that happened all", "52:11", "over the world in Europe and Asia in", "52:14", "South America and in North America and", "52:16", "so on and pull all those elements and", "52:18", "then train the Train perception system", "52:21", "of autopilot to be able to to better", "52:25", "recognize those bicycles as part of the", "52:27", "car so every edge case like that they go", "52:30", "through hmm saying okay the car freaked", "52:32", "out in this moment let me find moments", "52:34", "like this in the rest of the data and", "52:37", "then improve the system so it's it's a", "52:41", "this kind of cycle is the way to deal", "52:44", "with with problems with failures of the", "52:48", "system", "52:48", "it's to say every time the car fails at", "52:51", "something say is this part of the bigger", "52:54", "set of problems can I find all those", "52:56", "problems and can I improve it with a new", "52:58", "update and that just keeps going the", "53:01", "open question is how many loops like", "53:03", "that you have to take for the car to", "53:05", "become really good better than human so", "53:09", "basically how hard is driving how many", "53:11", "weird situations when you manually drive", "53:14", "do you deal with every day somebody", "53:17", "somebody mentioned", "53:19", "there's like millions of cases when you", "53:20", "watch video you see them somebody", "53:22", "mentioned that they drive a truck", "53:26", "EPS truck and we'll pass cow pastures", "53:29", "and they know that if there's no cows in", "53:33", "the cow pasture that means they're", "53:35", "grazing and if they're grazing I mean", "53:39", "they'd be using the correct terms", "53:41", "I apologize not a car guy that that", "53:43", "means that there may be cows up ahead on", "53:45", "the road there's just this kind of", "53:48", "reasoning it can use to anticipate", "53:49", "difficult situations and we do we do", "53:52", "that kind of reasoning about like", "53:53", "everything cars today can't do that kind", "53:56", "of reasoning they're just perceiving", "53:58", "what's in front of them now outside of", "54:01", "Tesla how many other companies have", "54:03", "autonomous systems that are driving", "54:05", "their cars so maybe it's good to step", "54:07", "back there's several and there's several", "54:09", "leaders in each different approach", "54:11", "so first let's draw a line between the", "54:14", "different types of systems that are okay", "54:17", "one there's fully autonomous vehicles so", "54:19", "these are cars you can think about that", "54:21", "don't have a steering wheel or if they", "54:23", "have a steering wheel it doesn't matter", "54:25", "they're in full control and if there's a", "54:27", "crash the car company is liable do those", "54:31", "exist no okay it's it's a gray area", "54:36", "though because many companies are", "54:39", "basically saying that that's what", "54:41", "they're doing but they're not quite", "54:43", "there so the leader in that space is", "54:46", "used to be called Google self-driving", "54:47", "car program now it's called way mo they", "54:52", "are doing that there it's called", "54:54", "level four level five there's levels to", "54:56", "this game and this is this particular", "54:58", "level where it's fully autonomous now", "55:01", "they're trying to achieve full autonomy", "55:03", "but the way they're doing it currently", "55:07", "is they're testing on public roads with", "55:09", "what's called the safety driver so", "55:11", "there's a driver always ready to take", "55:12", "over and the driver does have to take", "55:16", "over at some rate you know frequently", "55:19", "and so the fact that the driver has to", "55:21", "take over that's not fully autonomous", "55:23", "then right so there's no car today that", "55:26", "you can just get in without a safety", "55:28", "driver so there's nobody behind the", "55:29", "wheel and using your app sort of", "55:32", "from page appointment right but out of", "55:34", "the cars that are semi-autonomous where", "55:37", "there is an autonomous program but you", "55:38", "do have to keep your hands on the wheel", "55:40", "and pay attention to the road now what", "55:42", "what are the leaders", "55:43", "besides Tesla there's Tesla and who else", "55:45", "is doing it so there's yeah there's", "55:48", "several systems it depends how you", "55:52", "define leader but so are they yeah see", "55:55", "this like there's Mercedes and BMW they", "55:57", "use the same system do they did someone", "56:00", "make a system for cars or do they create", "56:02", "their own system yeah that that's a", "56:04", "really good question so there's in some", "56:05", "cases there's mobile I and NVIDIA", "56:09", "there's these companies that Nvidia the", "56:12", "the video card computing car company yep", "56:14", "the same the same folks that power the", "56:16", "quake game right right the the graphics", "56:19", "on the quake game you can use those GPU", "56:21", "graphics processing units to run machine", "56:24", "learning code mm-hmm so they're also", "56:26", "creating the nvidia drive yeah scalable", "56:29", "AI platform for autonomous driving in", "56:31", "fact I don't when did you buy your Tesla", "56:36", "five months ago or something some like", "56:38", "so the thing in there now most likely is", "56:41", "a Nvidia Drive px 2 hmm", "56:43", "so the and that works on cameras that", "56:48", "that just runs code that takes in camera", "56:51", "data but it can work on anything else so", "56:54", "it could work on lidar as well somebody", "56:56", "have a system yeah but it need different", "56:59", "code so the lidar requires very", "57:01", "different kinds of processing very does", "57:02", "anybody use that with cars with all semi", "57:05", "autonomous cars lighter yes the well", "57:09", "okay so semi autonomous we have to be", "57:12", "careful right because the way no cars", "57:14", "like the the quote-unquote fully", "57:16", "autonomous cars are currently semi", "57:18", "autonomous right okay so the there are", "57:20", "the highest level of semi-autonomous", "57:22", "right yeah that guess it's it's not even", "57:25", "a highest level it's a principle it's a", "57:26", "philosophy difference because they're", "57:28", "saying we're gonna do full autonomy", "57:30", "we're just not quite there yet most", "57:33", "other companies they're doing semi", "57:35", "autonomous better called driver", "57:37", "assistance systems is they're saying", "57:40", "we're not interested in full autonomy we", "57:43", "just want a driver assistance system", "57:45", "that", "57:45", "helps you steer the car so let's call", "57:47", "those semi autonomous vehicles or driver", "57:50", "assistance systems the there's several", "57:53", "leaders in that space like one car we're", "57:55", "studying that's really interesting is", "57:57", "Cadillac super Krewe system so GM has", "58:01", "the system it's called super cruise that", "58:03", "I think is the best comparable system to", "58:07", "autopilot today the the key", "58:11", "differentiator there is there's a lot of", "58:14", "little elements but the key", "58:15", "differentiators there's a driver", "58:17", "monitoring system so there's a camera", "58:18", "that looks at you and tells you if your", "58:21", "eyes on the road or not and if your eyes", "58:23", "go off the road for I believe more than", "58:25", "six seconds it starts warning you and", "58:28", "says you have to be you have to get your", "58:29", "eyes back on the road so that's called", "58:31", "driver monitoring that's one of the big", "58:33", "disagreements for example you see me and", "58:35", "Elon and many experts in the field in", "58:39", "Elon and the Tesla approach is that", "58:41", "there should be a driving monitoring", "58:42", "system there should be a camera why does", "58:45", "Elon feel like there shouldn't be I", "58:46", "think his focus the Tesla's focus is on", "58:51", "just improving the system so fast and so", "58:54", "effectively that it doesn't matter what", "58:57", "the driver does that it it you know so", "59:01", "essentially no safety net no safety net", "59:03", "and I think they operate like that in", "59:09", "many ideas that they work with is they", "59:11", "sort of boldly proceed forward to try to", "59:14", "make the car extremely safe now the", "59:17", "concern there is you have to acknowledge", "59:19", "the psychology of human beings that", "59:21", "unless the car is perfect or under our", "59:24", "definition perfect which is much better", "59:26", "than human beings then you have to be", "59:30", "able to you have to be able to make sure", "59:34", "that the people are still paying", "59:35", "attention to help the car out when it", "59:37", "fails and for that you have to have", "59:40", "driving model you have to know what the", "59:42", "car is right now your Tesla only knows", "59:44", "about your presence from the steering", "59:46", "wheel well touching the steering wheel", "59:48", "which is a kind of driving monitoring", "59:50", "system it knows you're there but it's", "59:52", "not nearly as effective at knowing", "59:54", "you're there", "59:55", "cognitively visually you can be tricked", "59:58", "by a clamp", "59:59", "you've seen people do that they had to", "60:00", "develop these clamps that you just put", "60:02", "on the steering wheel it'll hold a phone", "60:03", "and then also tricked the system into", "60:06", "thinking that you're holding all the", "60:07", "wheel yeah you could do a lot of purses", "60:09", "actually work really well don't ask me", "60:11", "how hanging a purse no like shoving a", "60:14", "person really into the somebody who did", "60:16", "that with an orange or something I found", "60:18", "what they said it didn't work maybe", "60:20", "needs to be all the way we're on the", "60:22", "outside of it I think it depends on the", "60:23", "shape of the orange how ripe it is", "60:25", "there's a lot of debate no I the point", "60:27", "is there's ways to trick the system", "60:29", "there's it's not monitoring the driver", "60:31", "that's the point yeah it's not", "60:32", "monitoring and driving a lot of people", "60:34", "believe you need to you you think you", "60:37", "need to make sense yeah I think I think", "60:39", "not just for the safety of the system", "60:42", "but to create an experience like I think", "60:45", "there's value for the car to know more", "60:49", "about you mmm-hmm sort of just like that", "60:52", "what's happening there it's scanning", "60:54", "this guy's eyes that's ignored your", "60:58", "porch it freaks me out", "60:59", "so yeah there's a lot of companies sort", "61:02", "of springing up they're doing computer", "61:03", "vision on the face and so on to try to", "61:05", "detect where you're looking", "61:06", "so what cars have that now the the major", "61:11", "one is the super consistent it's not", "61:12", "many cars a few cars are starting to add", "61:14", "it Europe what's a super Krewe system", "61:17", "that's the GM Cadillac okay they're", "61:20", "trying to so it's in they're super", "61:22", "expensive lineup currently and they're I", "61:24", "think trying to add it to the full", "61:26", "lineup of all so in like Cadillacs what", "61:28", "is that big cruiser that they have now", "61:30", "the big 4-door car the really high-end", "61:34", "ct6 I don't know what it is they have a", "61:36", "new one that's really nice is that what", "61:39", "they're putting in the big sedan that", "61:42", "thing yes I it's pretty I don't know if", "61:46", "that's the C g6 but the the one we're", "61:47", "looking at the CT six yes that's us 2018", "61:51", "CT six yeah it's you know it's a but", "61:56", "they won't add it to their their full", "61:58", "fleet so really interesting have the", "61:59", "same amount of cameras as the Tesla", "62:01", "system does no and it has a very", "62:03", "different philosophy as well in another", "62:04", "way which is it only works on very", "62:08", "specific roads on interstate highways", "62:10", "there's something called OD", "62:13", "operational design domain so they they", "62:16", "define that this thing super cool system", "62:19", "only works on this particular set of", "62:21", "roads and they're basically just major", "62:23", "highways the Tesla approach is saying", "62:26", "they were basically what Elan jokingly", "62:29", "referred to as a GD right is it works", "62:32", "basically anywhere so if you try to turn", "62:35", "on your autopilot you can basically turn", "62:37", "out anywhere or the cameras are able to", "62:39", "determine either lane markings or the", "62:41", "car in front of you mm-hmm and so that's", "62:43", "a very different approach saying you can", "62:45", "basically make your work anywhere or in", "62:47", "cattle a case making work on only", "62:49", "specific kinds of roads so you can test", "62:51", "the heck out of those roads you can map", "62:54", "those roads so you can use actually", "62:55", "lidar to map the full road so you know", "62:58", "the full geometry of all the the", "63:01", "interstate highway system they can", "63:03", "operate on and then just also coordinate", "63:06", "with GPS where SOTA understands where", "63:07", "like bumps in the road might be or Hills", "63:10", "in that sense according to GPS for", "63:13", "different curvature information but not", "63:15", "the topography the know and like", "63:17", "construction is a big one that would be", "63:18", "crazy for new potholes", "63:20", "you know I well potholes isn't a big", "63:23", "problem I think construction is the big", "63:25", "problem like just this quickly changing", "63:28", "dynamic information which like apps like", "63:30", "Waze provide I mean that puddles are a", "63:32", "pretty big problem in Boston oh yeah no", "63:35", "for sure but New York is actually", "63:37", "probably even worse I blew out two tires", "63:39", "in one day in New York on potholes it's", "63:43", "not an unlucky day yeah but the I'd", "63:46", "rather you blow out your tire for sure", "63:47", "then then I mean the the kind of", "63:50", "fatality that happened in in the", "63:53", "mountain view with Tesla I believe is", "63:55", "slightly construction related so I mean", "63:57", "there's a lot of safety critical events", "63:59", "yeah I would like if that stupid Tesla", "64:02", "could figure out the hole in the ground", "64:04", "know so I didn't have to blow a tire out", "64:05", "come on bro feel your pain Joe figure it", "64:08", "out but priorities I'll uh I'll make", "64:12", "sure I'll forward this podcast to you", "64:14", "lines remember they work on this I think", "64:16", "he's busy yeah what is this Jaime Tesla", "64:18", "auto pot will be able to avoid potholes", "64:19", "in the road says Elon Musk haha", "64:22", "motherfuckers on top of shit", "64:25", "what's the date on that April April 7th", "64:27", "okay", "64:28", "just now yeah and that's an interesting", "64:31", "thing that's another that's almost an", "64:33", "ethical question whether you want a car", "64:35", "to avoid a situation by swerving right", "64:40", "because when you swerve you now", "64:41", "introduce as opposed to sort of breaking", "64:44", "the vehicle you're swerving into another", "64:47", "Lane means you might create a safety", "64:49", "situation elsewhere you might put", "64:52", "somebody else in danger yeah that's why", "64:53", "I was saying if it coordinated with GPS", "64:55", "it would have previous knowledge you", "64:58", "know sort of like Waze tells you where", "65:00", "the cops are yep you know I mean so that", "65:02", "kind of information would be extremely", "65:04", "powerful and useful the the problem is", "65:07", "it's hard to get it really up to date", "65:11", "that kind of information really up to", "65:13", "date mm-hmm it's just an infrastructure", "65:15", "question just getting the getting the", "65:17", "software the data in place to where the", "65:19", "car will be able to learn quickly from", "65:20", "all the things that are changing I think", "65:22", "potholes don't change that often so that", "65:24", "that's that's a different thing but in", "65:26", "terms of construction zones in terms of", "65:28", "other weird things that change the", "65:31", "dynamics the geometry of the road mm-hmm", "65:33", "that's that's difficult to to get right", "65:35", "so Cadillacs doing a version of it but", "65:38", "it sounds like it's a little bit less", "65:40", "and less involved less comprehensive", "65:44", "maybe this is a better way of drama yeah", "65:46", "unless I would say it's more safety", "65:49", "focused as a sort of what's the right", "65:53", "word to use here it's more cautious", "65:55", "mm-hmm in its implementation so GM again", "65:59", "has has a tradition for better for worse", "66:03", "just like Jamie do they have on their", "66:07", "website and discipline problems showing", "66:08", "you shows like it's a signal coming on", "66:11", "oh wow the green a attention lady she's", "66:14", "too hot it's not paying attention", "66:15", "looking at people staring at her no", "66:17", "comment one of the one of the things", "66:21", "that you it's hard to talk about without", "66:23", "actually experience in the system is", "66:25", "what's more important than driving", "66:27", "monitoring and any of the details we", "66:29", "talked about is like how the whole thing", "66:30", "feels the whole thing together how its", "66:33", "implemented the whole interface and the", "66:36", "the catalog system was actually done", "66:37", "really well in a", "66:39", "that there's a clarity to it like", "66:41", "everything becomes there's a green color", "66:43", "and a blue color and you know exactly", "66:45", "when the system is on and when it's off", "66:46", "that's one of the big things people", "66:48", "struggle with is just confusing in in", "66:52", "other cars drivers not being able to", "66:54", "understand when the system is on or off", "66:56", "oh all right so you think the system is", "66:58", "doing it and then just slam into", "67:00", "something yet it wasn't even on now when", "67:02", "this car is operating in this manner how", "67:05", "many cameras is it using you know that's", "67:08", "a good question I should know that but I", "67:10", "think it's only forward to facing", "67:12", "cameras as far as I know I think it's", "67:14", "two cameras it may be three cameras tell", "67:17", "it just sat back so she doesn't have her", "67:19", "hands on the wheel at all yep so she's", "67:22", "watching right because the car is able", "67:25", "to see where the eyes are", "67:26", "it's a hands-off system so you're a lot", "67:29", "to take your hands off the wheel mm-hmm", "67:31", "it's very interesting it's uh and there", "67:34", "are certain human behavior aspects that", "67:37", "come into play to this so you start to", "67:40", "like I found myself actually becoming a", "67:43", "little more drowsy with this system I", "67:46", "haven't driven it enough so I haven't", "67:48", "gotten used to it but you have to at", "67:50", "least in the initial stages it kind of", "67:53", "forced you to look at the road in in a", "67:56", "way that felt artificial I think it's", "67:58", "something that gets better with time you", "68:01", "get used to it but it's almost like a", "68:02", "game a fide thing that the car when you", "68:05", "look off-road starts to tell you that", "68:09", "you're looking off-road so you kind of", "68:10", "psychologically pressure to always stare", "68:14", "at the road and you realize that", "68:15", "actually when you drive you often look", "68:17", "around and so having to like stare", "68:20", "forward can be a little bit yeah exactly", "68:23", "you start I think there's something", "68:25", "useful and hypnotic about those lanes", "68:28", "just coming at you and just the lines", "68:30", "yeah why is that that confuses a shit", "68:33", "out of me because I could not be tired", "68:35", "at all but if it's nighttime I'm on the", "68:37", "highway and those lines they just start", "68:39", "to yeah take you to dream land", "68:42", "I get the same with there's also just", "68:44", "the vibration is that like that that hum", "68:46", "of driving same with trains you know", "68:49", "yeah planes as well yeah puts me out", "68:52", "so that that there's a Cadillac system", "68:55", "that's the big leader I would say in the", "68:58", "driver monitoring and then Tesla is the", "69:01", "no driver monitoring and huge data", "69:03", "collection BMW has a system as well to", "69:06", "use yeah BMW what do they use them I", "69:09", "don't I don't want to speak too much to", "69:11", "the details they have lane keeping", "69:12", "system so basically systems that keep", "69:14", "you in the lane that is similar to what", "69:18", "in spirit autopilot is supposed to do", "69:20", "but is less aggressive and how often you", "69:22", "can use and so on if you look at the", "69:24", "performance of the of the actual how", "69:27", "often the system is able to keep you in", "69:29", "Lane autopilot is currently the leader", "69:31", "in that space and they're also the most", "69:34", "aggressive innovators in that space so", "69:38", "they're like really pushing it to", "69:39", "improve for them further and the open", "69:41", "question is the worrying question is if", "69:45", "it improves much more are there going to", "69:47", "be effects like complacency like people", "69:50", "will will take we'll start texting more", "69:53", "we start looking off-road more that's a", "69:55", "it's an a totally open question and", "69:56", "nobody knows the answer to that really", "69:59", "and there's a lot of folks that", "70:01", "convention in the safety engineers and", "70:04", "human factors community so these", "70:05", "psychology folks who have roots and like", "70:07", "aviation that know there's there's been", "70:11", "70 years of work that looks at vigilance", "70:13", "that people if I force you to sit here", "70:16", "and monitor for something weird", "70:19", "happening like radar operators in the", "70:21", "world war two had to watch you know for", "70:24", "the dot to appear if I sit you behind", "70:27", "that radar and make you do it after", "70:30", "about 15 minutes but really thirty", "70:33", "minutes you'll see your rate of being", "70:35", "able to detect any problems will go down", "70:37", "significantly you just kind of zone out", "70:39", "hmm and so there's like all kinds of", "70:41", "psychology studies that show that we", "70:43", "just wear crappy human beings are really", "70:45", "crappy at monitoring automation mmm if I", "70:47", "tell you if I put a robot and you just", "70:49", "say monitor this system so it doesn't", "70:52", "kill anyone you'll you know - now we", "70:54", "have to be engaged you have to be", "70:55", "engaged you have to be you know there", "70:57", "has to be a dance attention come we", "70:59", "don't have a mode for watching", "71:02", "autonomous things right if you consider", "71:05", "historically the kind of modes that", "71:06", "people have for observing things we", "71:08", "don't really have a mode for making sure", "71:10", "that an autonomous thing does its job", "71:12", "yeah it's sort of mindset it's not like", "71:15", "oh you know to me like you fit my car", "71:17", "okay I'm driving here we go driving a", "71:19", "turn I'm thinking I'm in driving mode", "71:21", "when you're in autonomous mode and", "71:24", "you're observing you just like what is", "71:26", "this I've never done this before this is", "71:27", "fucking weird it feels weird it's not", "71:29", "part of human nature right it's a normal", "71:31", "state one thing it's done commonly in", "71:34", "now is aviation so pilots pilots are", "71:38", "basically MA during fully autonomous", "71:40", "planes yeah that's a good point as far", "71:42", "as I know mainly planes today could fly", "71:45", "almost fully autonomously it's also a", "71:46", "good point when it comes to software and", "71:48", "updates because isn't that part of the", "71:50", "issue with this Boeing 737 active system", "71:53", "yeah these systems that they've had", "71:54", "problems with they've been faulty and a", "71:58", "couple have crashed", "71:59", "yeah and that that's a really good point", "72:02", "and they they've yeah there's been two", "72:05", "tragic crashes recently with with the", "72:08", "Mac system and if they bench those", "72:09", "things right haven't they", "72:10", "I'm not following they also got rid of a", "72:14", "bunch of inspectors I think they fired", "72:16", "like 80 inspectors today and the unions", "72:18", "are freaking out yep", "72:20", "there's obviously this politics have joy", "72:22", "is I think FA is supposed to supervise", "72:26", "and there were there was there's a close", "72:27", "relationship between Boeing and FAA", "72:29", "those questions around I mean there's", "72:30", "better experts at that than me but on", "72:32", "the software side it is worrying because", "72:35", "it was a single software update", "72:37", "essentially that helps prevent the", "72:39", "vehicle of the vehicle the airplane from", "72:42", "stalling so if if it's if the nose is", "72:47", "tilting up increasing chance of stalling", "72:49", "it's going to automate automatically", "72:51", "point the nose down of the airplane and", "72:54", "the the pilots in many cases as far as I", "72:57", "understand weren't even informed of this", "72:59", "update right there they weren't even", "73:01", "told this happening the idea behind the", "73:04", "update is that they're not supposed to", "73:06", "really know it's supposed to just manage", "73:07", "the flight for you right the problem", "73:10", "happened when there's

"sure yeah so the question is whether you", "152:30", "hold that back their decision was to say", "152:33", "let's hold it let's not release it that", "152:36", "scares me", "152:37", "do not release it yeah yeah you know why", "152:39", "it scares me it scares me that they", "152:41", "would think that that's like this", "152:42", "mindset that they they sense the", "152:46", "inevitable the

scared of it there's", "153:08", "getting out right yeah that scares the", "153:10", "shit out of me like if they're scared of", "153:12", "it they're the people that make it and", "153:13", "they're they are called open AI me this", "153:16", "is the idea behind the group where", "153:17", "everybody kind of agrees that you're", "153:19", "going to use the brightest minds and", "153:21", "have

you just saw that that it can do that", "153:41", "but if you think through like what that", "153:43", "would actually create I mean it's", "153:44", "possible it'll be dangerous but it's not", "153:46", "the point is they're doing it they try", "153:48", "to do it early run to raise the question", "153:51", "what do we do here because yeah what do", "153:53", "we do because they're directly going to", "153:56", "be able to improve this now like if", "153:58", "they're if we can generate basically ten", "154:01", "times more content of your face saying a", "154:04", "bunch of stuff what is that what do we", "154:07", "do with that if a Jamie all of a sudden", "154:10", "on the side develops a much better", "154:12", "generator and has your face doesn't", "154:16", "offshoot podcast essentially fake Joe", "154:19", "Rogan experience hmm and what do we do", "154:21", "to see release that you know does he", "154:24", "because now we can have basically", "154:29", "generate content

way", "155:35", "it's all in the way and we have to this", "155:37", "is the time to talk about it think about", "155:39", "it one of the funny things about Kyle", "155:41", "Dunnigan", "155:41",

we're probably going to", "156:29", "have to do something if I the only", "156:32", "argument against you VI in my eyes is", "156:35", "human nature the idea that we could", "156:38", "possibly take

idea", "157:55", "yeah so it's it's like like everything", "157:58", "else it's super messy so what is the", "158:00", "right what is the right amount and how", "158:03", "do we pay for it and
