"03:29", "probably sounds really crazy but", "03:30", "when you're writing a book you're", "03:32", "literally inside working all the time", "03:34", "yeah so explain to people what the book", "03:36", "is", "03:37", "so the book is called the end of gender", "03:39", "and before i go any further i'm going to", "03:41", "explain the title because", "03:42", "some people i think misinterpret what i", "03:44", "when i announced it on social media", "03:46", "some people were getting upset because i", "03:47", "think they thought i was taking a very", "03:49", "very far-left", "03:50",

sexual", "04:39", "neuroscience research", "04:42", "i made the transition from academic", "04:44", "being an academic sex researcher", "04:46", "to being a journalist so now i write", "04:48", "about the science of sex and gender", "04:50", "i read about the politicization of", "04:51", "science and academic censorship", "04:54", "and so now i have this book out and i", "04:56", "can talk a bit about how i", "04:57", "got here if that would be helpful sure", "05:00", "sure", "05:00", "yeah yeah so uh when i was doing my phd", "05:04", "i very much i loved being a sex", "05:07", "researcher i really thought i was going", "05:08", "to stay in academia and in the last", "05:10", "few years i noticed that there had been", "05:11", "a change in the climate", "05:13", "in terms of what people could study what", "05:15", "people could talk about", "05:16", "as scientific experts and one area in", "05:19", "particular was about", "05:21", "gender transition in children so every", "05:23",

transitioning so that means to", "05:32", "take on a name a new name identifies the", "05:35", "opposite sex usually get a haircut start", "05:36", "dressing like the opposite sex", "05:38", "but from a scientific perspective all of", "05:40", "the research", "05:41", "actually shows that most of these kids", "05:44", "the vast majority of them are more", "05:45", "likely to grow up to be", "05:46", "gay in adulthood they're not going to be", "05:48", "transgender", "05:50", "and at that time there's literally maybe", "05:52", "one or two news articles", "05:53", "that called into question this narrative", "05:56", "of early transitioning so i wrote an", "05:58", "op-ed about this citing the scientific", "06:00", "research and i asked my colleagues and", "06:02", "mentors in academia", "06:04", "you know what do you think i knew that", "06:06", "there was going to be some backlash to", "06:08", "it", "06:09", "and one of my mentors said to me because", "06:11", "i said should i wait until i have tenure", "06:13", "to put something like this out and he", "06:15", "said nowadays tenure is not going to", "06:17", "protect you", "06:18", "so that sealed my decision i published", "06:20", "the piece", "06:21", "and then from there i made the", "06:23", "transition to journalism and i haven't", "06:24", "looked back", "06:25", "it's a very strange time when it comes", "06:28", "to talking about certain subjects", "06:29", "because it doesn't matter", "06:30", "what the science is there's a there", "06:33", "there are specific narratives", "06:35", "that you have to adhere to in today's", "06:37", "climate you know i", "06:38", "like you and also left but when you when", "06:41", "it comes to", "06:42", "saying like far left like far left is a", "06:44", "different thing now than it used to be", "06:46", "far left used to be i mean 10 just 10 15", "06:50", "years ago it was a different animal", "06:51", "and i knew a lot of people that were far", "06:53", "left now far left i associate with", "06:55", "lunacy", "06:56", "it's like i look at it the same way i", "06:58", "look at far right i look at far right", "06:59", "extremists and far left extremists", "07:01", "but something happened where far left", "07:04", "ideology", "07:05", "has permeated our culture when it comes", "07:07", "to gender", "07:08", "and uh i don't understand it i don't it", "07:11", "if you don't adhere to this ideology", "07:15", "people want to say that you're you have", "07:17", "no compassion", "07:18", "you're evil you're bigoted i had abigail", "07:21",

narrative by having her on", "07:31", "men's health wrote a piece about me", "07:33", "saying i'm fanning the flames of hate", "07:35", "because she was talking about a 4 000", "07:38", "increase", "07:39", "4 000 increase in teenage girls", "07:42", "identifying as trans and rapid onset", "07:45", "gender dysphoria", "07:46", "which is real i mean this is this is a", "07:48", "real scientific thing how many times", "07:50", "70 times what you would see in the", "07:51", "general population in terms of people", "07:53", "identifying as transgender", "07:55", "it's amazing um she was talking about", "07:58", "this", "07:58", "in this very specific way talking about", "08:02", "awkward teenage girls and about how", "08:04", "these girls have", "08:06", "you know really odd situations in terms", "08:10", "of the way they deal with people", "08:11", "socially", "08:12", "and then all of a sudden they're praised", "08:14", "for deciding that they're trans", "08:16", "and then they get these clusters of", "08:18", "friends that also decide that they're", "08:20", "trans", "08:20", "which is very strange it's just a very", "08:22", "strange phenomenon but you're not even", "08:24", "allowed to talk about it", "08:25", "so if if men's health which is it's a", "08:28", "fucking men's magazine", "08:29", "is gonna write articles calling you a", "08:32", "hateful person", "08:33", "because you're discussing it there was", "08:34", "no hate in that podcast at all", "08:36", "it was just discussing it like what is", "08:38", "causing this why is this", "08:40", "and what what can be done and why are we", "08:43", "so", "08:44", "quick to just i mean we we can assume", "08:47", "that people are troubled in all sorts of", "08:49", "different ways", "08:50", "but we can't assume they're ever", "08:51", "troubled when it comes to gender it's", "08:53", "it's very bizarre i think what you were", "08:56", "saying with", "08:57", "why it's gone so far left i do think a", "08:59", "lot of this is coming from empathy", "09:02", "which is a good thing and i i have to", "09:04", "say you know i", "09:05", "with regard to the issue of", "09:06", "transitioning children i do support", "09:08", "traditioning in adults i think it can", "09:10", "help", "09:10", "adults who are transgender i think if", "09:12", "you're an adult it's your decision it's", "09:14", "your body it's no one's place to tell", "09:16", "you what to do", "09:17", "but i think a lot of this is coming from", "09:19", "so i grew up in the gay community", "09:20", "and i remember seeing how homophobic", "09:23", "people could be toward my friends", "09:25", "and i think things have changed things", "09:28", "have gotten better", "09:29", "in some ways i think homophobia still", "09:30", "exists and we can talk about that", "09:31", "because i do talk about how that affects", "09:33", "a lot of", "09:33", "what we're seeing in the book but i", "09:36", "think for a lot of people they look at", "09:37", "that and they say okay we were wrong", "09:39", "about that we were wrong to treat gay", "09:41", "people differently we were wrong to say", "09:43", "that being gay is something you can", "09:44", "change", "09:45", "so now they've gone completely in the", "09:46", "opposite direction saying okay", "09:48", "no matter what anyone says with regard", "09:50", "to their identity", "09:52", "with regard to their gender this is", "09:54", "something that we should not challenge", "09:55", "we should fully support", "09:56", "and if you question it in any way even", "09:58", "in the most nuanced or sensitive way as", "10:01", "i try to and as i think you do", "10:02", "that's still not acceptable yeah that's", "10:05", "what's strange", "10:06", "it's it's an ideology it's rigid it's", "10:08", "like a religion", "10:10", "it is it is i think i find people who", "10:13", "are", "10:15", "you know middle of the road they're not", "10:16", "sure what to think if they read my work", "10:18", "or they talk to me they say oh wow i", "10:20", "never", "10:20", "i never realized that i didn't know the", "10:22", "science said that and they changed their", "10:24", "perspective but i think for some people", "10:26", "if they are very much invested in the", "10:28", "identity or very", "10:29", "very invested in activism or for", "10:31", "whatever reason this ideology means", "10:33", "something to them", "10:34", "it's you cannot you just cannot reason", "10:37", "with them", "10:38", "it doesn't matter what the science says", "10:40", "they will find something to pick at and", "10:42", "especially with desistance which is that", "10:44", "that the research i was mentioning where", "10:47", "shows that most kids will not feel", "10:48", "gender dysphoric", "10:49", "anymore when they re reach puberty they", "10:52", "they just people some people cannot", "10:53", "accept it and they will call you", "10:55", "transphobic they'll call you bigoted and", "10:57", "you know i don't think i'm any of those", "10:59", "things i'm really just trying to", "11:00", "help prevent these children from making", "11:03", "potentially a very bad decision that", "11:04", "they're going to regret", "11:05", "and especially now we're seeing in the", "11:07", "uk that this is happening where more", "11:09", "detransitioners are saying", "11:11", "this was something i regret this was a", "11:12", "mistake why did the adults not challenge", "11:14", "me", "11:15", "i really think so right now we're in", "11:16", "august 2020. i think within the five", "11:18", "next five years or maybe a little bit", "11:20", "longer we're going to be seeing", "11:21", "an explosion of children coming out and", "11:24", "saying i did not want to transition this", "11:26", "was a mistake and it's really going to", "11:27", "be awful", "11:28", "well we're already seeing that there's a", "11:29", "lawsuit that was uh very prominent in", "11:31", "the uk recently about a young girl", "11:34", "who transitioned to be do you know the", "11:35", "lawsuit i'm talking about i do yeah kira", "11:37", "bell", "11:37", "yeah i mean it's it's heartbreaking", "11:39", "because they she's essentially ruined", "11:42", "her body", "11:43", "to the point where she's not going to be", "11:44", "able to have children she's she'll", "11:47", "you know she and in many cases a lot of", "11:49", "these girls can't have orgasms", "11:51", "ever again no exactly yeah and but i", "11:53", "think in north america", "11:55", "we are still very much in denial about", "11:57", "this if", "11:58", "i mean whenever i'm on a show if i'm on", "12:00", "tv and i talk about this", "12:02", "the backlash after is just crazy and i'm", "12:04", "thinking", "12:05", "people need to wake up i'm trying to", "12:07", "stop this from happening right the whole", "12:09", "point of writing this book", "12:10", "and saying these things is trying to", "12:11", "prevent what's about to happen yeah um", "12:14", "the backlash is it's it's very strange", "12:17", "because", "12:17", "a lot of the backlash is from trans", "12:19", "folks and it seems that", "12:21", "they equate any criticism or any", "12:24", "any examination of even children even", "12:27", "small children", "12:28", "transitioning to transphobia you you", "12:31", "must hate", "12:32", "and i get there there has to be some", "12:35", "trans people that", "12:36", "as children knew that they were women or", "12:39", "they were the opposite sex", "12:40", "that they were in the wrong body there", "12:42", "has to be", "12:44", "the question yeah i don't disagree with", "12:45", "that i think we both", "12:47", "don't the question is how many and how", "12:50", "do they make that decision", "12:51", "and how many of us are actually being", "12:53", "influenced by other factors", "12:55", "external children are very malleable and", "12:57", "that's part of the problem with making", "12:59", "lifelong decisions as a six-year-old", "13:02", "if you're a six-year-old male and you", "13:04", "decide that you're a female and you go", "13:06", "through the transition and then", "13:08", "you realize you're a gay man later in", "13:10", "life there's no recourse there's nothing", "13:12", "you can do to rectify that", "13:14", "that's what's terrifying about this and", "13:16", "that you're not allowed to talk about it", "13:17", "you're not", "13:18", "you're not allowed to say that even", "13:21", "right", "13:21", "right and when i do point that out", "13:23", "people say that i'm using the gay", "13:25", "community to try and as a shield or", "13:27", "something like that", "13:28", "but medical professionals need to be the", "13:30", "ones to do their job because it is their", "13:32", "job", "13:33", "they should be doing proper assessments", "13:35", "with these children", "13:36", "and adults too to determine you know", "13:38", "what is the best

can't do their jobs", "13:47", "right now everyone i know that is", "13:48", "ethical in the field", "13:50", "has left or they stopped working with", "13:52", "these patients because", "13:53", "they don't feel they can do their job", "13:55", "properly so what you have instead is the", "13:57", "people who are currently operating are", "13:59", "activists", "14:00", "and they will really facilitate whatever", "14:01", "patient wants them to do whether or not", "14:03", "that", "14:04", "may or may not be the right thing for", "14:05", "them yeah how did we get to this point", "14:08",

know", "38:49", "where we go from here", "38:51", "i mean i don't i never thought we would", "38:53", "be here", "38:54", "to in a place where there were these", "38:56", "taboo subjects", "38:58",

why", "41:33", "are we not saying it's", "41:34", "again it's okay to be a woman and it's", "41:36", "okay to feel this way", "41:38", "and let's support you in that instead of", "41:40", "abandoning

are accepted just like", "42:23", "people with blue eyes and brown eyes and", "42:25", "whatever no one cares anymore", "42:27", "is that what it's going to take for for", "42:30", "things to balance

there's people that are you", "42:40", "know mildly masculine", "42:42", "or people that are like very very", "42:45", "feminine but also", "42:46", "a man okay well let me start with", "42:50", "the first part of your question was why", "42:52", "do people go along with this i think", "42:54", "the part of it might be because it's", "42:56", "more socially acceptable right and", "42:57", "people", "42:58", "don't want to rock the boat i think", "42:59", "other people they mean well and they", "43:01", "think that this is", "43:02", "this is going to help the community and", "43:03",

so i", "43:20", "don't want to speak for trans people but", "43:22", "i i think there are some people who for", "43:24", "whom transitioning is the right choice i", "43:26", "think for some people",

unfortunately that is also", "70:38", "the case when it comes to", "70:39", "some trans activists they want they want", "70:42", "more trans people out", "70:44", "there right because and i can see that", "70:47", "logic because", "70:49", "by inflating the number of people who", "70:51", "identify this way and so also with", "70:52", "the trans umbrella it's now widened to", "70:55", "also", "70:56", "include third genders or anyone who is", "70:58", "even gender non just simply gender", "71:00", "non-conforming", "71:01", "so i think part of this is driven by the", "71:04", "desire to

they're", "71:31", "not the same", "71:32", "as me and it's not appropriate to say we", "71:35", "were the same", "71:36", "and again from my perspective if someone", "71:38", "is", "71:39",

can't talk about what the root", "71:47", "cause is you're not going to help", "71:48", "someone", "71:49", "yeah i i would agree and i think that", "71:51", "one of the things we might be", "71:52",

people", "72:37", "part of the push with the children is to", "72:39", "say look if if kids are feeling this way", "72:42", "and society accepts us in children then", "72:44", "again this is something that", "72:46", "people can't people can't argue against", "72:48", "right i think in part it's part of a", "72:49", "larger", "72:50", "goal to facilitate acceptance for adults", "72:53", "as well",

are", "73:20", "going to make it more difficult for them", "73:22", "to identify as the opposite sex", "73:25", "yeah this is a really this the one of", "73:27", "the things that was disturbing to me", "73:28", "that didn't make any goddamn sense was", "73:30", "people saying that", "73:31", "you can block their hormones and then if", "73:33", "they change their mind", "73:35", "you it's easily

no when", "73:57", "when you", "73:58", "there's radical changes to the body that", "73:59", "are irreversible when you block", "74:01", "hormones at a very young age i had this", "74:04",

yeah i think i mean i most people", "110:07", "would say that human sexuality is really", "110:09", "fascinating", "110:10", "and i would have a number of people say", "110:11", "to me in the time

guess", "115:11", "that would be why people that are", "115:13", "striving for women's equality", "115:15", "would tell women that you are exactly", "115:18", "the same thing as a man and you should",
