Roy was also", "12:20", "coming off of the John Ruiz fight where", "12:22", "he gained a lot of weight to get up to", "12:24", "heavy weight and then he had to lose", "12:25", "that weight to get down the light", "12:27", "heavyweight again so he was lean at", "12:29", "heavy weight and then all sudden he's", "12:31", "dropping down to 175 pounds again and he", "12:35", "just looked like shit he looks smooth it", "12:38", "looked like his body was all sucked in", "12:39", "and I just think it was a bad bad way", "12:42", "cut and you know I think whatever he", "12:45", "took to get himself up to 200 pounds -", "12:47", "was probably out of his system", "12:48", "and now his body was you know his", "12:51", "hormones are probably all fucked up it", "12:53", "just wasn't the same", "12:53", "I mean this let's be real right that we", "12:56", "important you don't just grow to 200", "12:59", "pounds without some Mexican supplements", "13:04", "it'll take a long fucking time for 168", "13:07", "pounds to get up to 200 pounds it takes", "13:11", "a long time if you want to really get up", "13:14", "to 200 pounds", "13:15", "like an actual 200-pound body not just", "13:18", "like

just you", "35:19", "know a lot of it to you because you", "35:22", "fight three times a year like you're not", "35:24", "always you're not always honest with", "35:25", "your diet either you know come from", "35:27", "coming from Mexican descent we like to", "35:30", "we love to eat my mom's house and it's", "35:32", "gonna be lay down but when you're in", "35:37", "camp how do you organize your nutrition", "35:40", "oh this I'm disciplined I have I have a", "35:42", "meal prep company they deliver my food", "35:44", "like every three like every three days", "35:45", "and as your meal prep based on your", "35:48", "suggestions to them or your", "35:50", "recommendations and directions to them", "35:51", "ya know a lot of us based on kind of", "35:54", "well my diets just according to kind of", "35:57", "like my training schedule so Mike my", "35:59", "training is very very organized like now", "36:01", "Joe I'm like a pretty much I'm on I'm on", "36:05", "I'm a professional now I guess you could", "36:07", "say like I I do things you know the", "36:10", "right way I used the whole scientific", "36:11", "route the nutrition routes just uh", "36:13", "almost like how burn our hot beans kind", "36:16", "of as he got older man he kind of", "36:18", "changed his whole philosophy started", "36:20", "using science more I think everything", "36:22", "now in my life when I get ready for", "36:24", "fights is all based on us all based on", "36:26", "science how did Barnard change his", "36:27", "training do you know um he just started", "36:30", "recovering more I think he started using", "36:33", "a lot of those neural stems hyperbaric", "36:36", "chambers think things of that man things", "36:38", "of that matter and just more scientific", "36:40", "base like just his whole training I like", "36:42", "all around and did you incorporate any", "36:45", "of those methods I did I did actually I", "36:47", "ended up you know connecting with this", "36:49", "connecting with this company called", "36:51", "neural force one you know science space", "36:53", "company and I actually wanted to bring", "36:55", "them in to kind of to kind of talk about", "36:56", "it Joe because this right here might", "36:58", "just changed my my whole philosophy", "36:59", "we're talking about the whole week how", "37:01", "the whole way way cuz how I struggled to", "37:03", "to how my whole chain has changed", "37:06", "because of because of because of science", "37:09", "hmm and a science that's very uh that a", "37:12", "science that's very I guess complex you", "37:15", "could say you gotta have like the right", "37:18", "people man like dictating your schedule", "37:20", "so when you set up a training camp like", "37:22", "this how far in advance", "37:24", "do you sit down and work out all the", "37:26", "details it's almost like the the morning", "37:29", "that we wake up is what we know we're", "37:31", "gonna do but but how like say if you", "37:33", "know you have a fight in July when would", "37:35", "you start preparing for that and when do", "37:37", "you sit down and map everything out well", "37:39", "we try to map things out maybe about", "37:41", "three months in advance kind of like a", "37:42", "preparation and to leading to the camp", "37:45", "and that's kind of like the phase that", "37:47", "we're on now like now we're all not you", "37:48", "know if I fight if it is an F fight in", "37:50", "January it's almost like our schedule", "37:53", "it's like there's there's there's a", "37:54", "pretest to the big test so tomorrow's", "37:57", "November 1st so if you were getting", "37:59", "ready for a fight in January you would", "38:01", "start ramping up somewhere around now", "38:03", "yeah but it would it would it would be", "38:05", "more of yeah we would I think the first", "38:08", "the first month leading up to the next", "38:10", "eight weeks would be a lot of it would", "38:12", "be a technical and tactical just working", "38:14", "on those particular areas that were", "38:16", "booked that we believe we're gonna be in", "38:18", "so you're not doing anything crazy", "38:19", "strength and conditioning wise you're", "38:21", "not trying to break your body down no no", "38:23", "it could because it's all it's all a", "38:25", "learning phase at that point you know", "38:26", "working the body preparing the body with", "38:28", "a lot of body motion movements and", "38:30", "things of that matter kind of just", "38:32", "bringing more circulation to certain", "38:34", "parts of my body then rather than you", "38:36", "know somebody picking up a kettlebell", "38:38", "and throwing it and and crazy things", "38:40", "like that like it like it it's all it's", "38:42", "all sports like specific Brian right", "38:45", "range of motion so how do you organize", "38:48", "this I kind of what who what is the team", "38:51", "of people that you use and like who's", "38:53", "responsible for what yeah well like I", "38:55", "said I think cuz that whole crew in the", "38:56", "back the man in America is with you but", "39:00", "you get the rest of the Avengers are all", "39:01", "waiting in the waiting room yeah I was", "39:05", "gonna say we first found him when he", "39:07", "hurt his hand and he had to rehab it", "39:09", "I'll see his going in layers going so he", "39:13", "had hurt his hand before his first fight", "39:17", "with Sergio Pettis and I was trying to", "39:19", "find any way for him to still compete", "39:21", "and we found somebody using this machine", "39:24", "which led us to actually neuro Force One", "39:28", "and Kareem and all these guys and we", "39:30", "tried to force it for him to get back in", "39:32", "time", "39:34", "and I have video of him just screaming", "39:36", "in pain trying to get there and we", "39:38", "thought we stayed off it for a couple", "39:40", "weeks and then the day of the faceoff he", "39:43", "went to cut weight and he said his", "39:45", "wrists kept slipping out and we had a", "39:47", "poem from the five you want to see the", "39:48", "doctor doctor said it no way shouldn't", "39:51", "fight so what was the injury I think it", "39:54", "was a it ended up being something with", "39:57", "sprained ligament yeah I think it was I", "39:59", "had sprain like one of my ligaments in", "40:02", "my hand so there's just there's nothing", "40:05", "I could do like I would I would I would", "40:07", "open the cap bottle for the you know", "40:09", "it's kind of to brush my teeth and like", "40:12", "it when I hurt - that poor I'm just like", "40:14", "man I can't do anything so the night", "40:17", "that you know I ended up far they ended", "40:18", "up Eric here and that have connected me", "40:20", "with with neural force and found out", "40:22", "that they had like these certain", "40:23", "machines that help you heal faster and", "40:26", "what did the machines do accelerated", "40:28", "recovery so it was like neuro stem and", "40:30", "they have about a thousand programs on", "40:33", "it and they just forced him to to", "40:36", "recover a lot faster the the best", "40:38", "example was UFC fighter Pantoja he was", "40:41", "on Ultimate Fighter 24 with us our", "40:43", "number one seed that we picked", "40:45", "Alexander Pantoja I saw him blow three", "40:48", "ligaments out of his elbow and he", "40:50", "started crying because he had a fight in", "40:51", "eight weeks and iearnt know Scotland and", "40:54", "um I said no no don't go home tomorrow", "40:59", "he's supposed to be going back on to", "41:00", "Brazil and I said no no no let's try", "41:02", "this you gotta try it and they did it", "41:03", "twice two sessions a day for ten days", "41:06", "and he went back and he and he fought he", "41:09", "fought that guy in beat him he were", "41:11", "naked choking that guy Neil Cirie and", "41:12", "put that guy in retirement so after that", "41:15", "I was like but if we need these guys", "41:18", "Henry whatever these guys did to Pantoja", "41:21", "whatever that we need to do it for you", "41:23", "so what's how it started when a guy gets", "41:25", "injured like that and you you're still", "41:27", "going through camp how do you work", "41:28", "around that injury just say okay there's", "41:30", "nothing squeezing nothing were you", "41:32", "putting any strain in those tendons", "41:33", "nothing where you're doing anything with", "41:35", "that hand that's gonna reinjure it I", "41:37", "think you just have to hope for somebody", "41:39", "to wrap it very well but they're screwed", "41:41", "you know having like a hand injury", "41:43", "like the probably the worst injury you", "41:45", "could have I mean we we eat with these", "41:46", "hands you know right this is our that's", "41:49", "how we survive you know and when you", "41:52", "have an injury like that there's you", "41:54", "gonna be fighting with the other do you", "41:56", "remember when you ride faber fought Mike", "41:58", "Brown mm-hmm and broke both hands yeah", "42:01", "just start throwing elbows and slapping", "42:03", "up it just didn't give in for a second", "42:06", "yeah that's how tough that motherfucker", "42:07", "is two broken hands trying to find a way", "42:09", "to win yeah it's miserable that's a yeah", "42:12", "it was a title fight too yep yep you do", "42:15", "mainly things for title fight yeah no", "42:18", "but III wanted to bring in Joe if you", "42:21", "allow me I'm good because I'm honored", "42:23", "man and I think I think III brought them", "42:27", "enjoy because I want them kind of share", "42:28", "you know kind of like the New Age stuff", "42:30", "like something that's just taken over", "42:32", "the top mm-hmm okay", "42:33", "Kevin area if you can hear me come down", "42:35", "can there's a bit long delay there's", "42:37", "like a 30-second delay you can go grab", "42:39", "them okay I'll grab ya go grab him", "42:42", "captain he's gonna come back with a new", "42:44", "layer he's gonna come back naked we", "42:49", "don't have another microphone", "42:50", "unfortunately so he's gonna have to take", "42:52", "your spot is not another microphone", "42:54", "nikka Captain America man when we use a", "42:56", "fourth microphone we actually have to", "42:58", "set it up and snot up right now and so", "43:00", "what do you think of Captain America", "43:01", "he's hilarious you know how you are with", "43:09", "uh with Eddie that's kind of how how he", "43:14", "you know no it's that certain", "43:17", "relationship yeah hey man that helps how", "43:20", "are you sir well good how you doing Joe", "43:22", "tell everybody who you are I mean I'm", "43:23", "Kevin Longoria I am the chief science", "43:25", "officer for neuro Force one you go and", "43:27", "then I'm a neurophysiologist as well so", "43:29", "keep this about like a fist from your", "43:31", "face okay so um tell us what your role", "43:34", "was in camp and what you did to help him", "43:38", "get ready go yes so uh neuro Force one", "43:41", "is a neuroscience based training company", "43:43", "and a medical grade diagnostic testing", "43:45", "company as well where you guys we're at", "43:47", "Scottsdale Arizona so what we really", "43:48", "focus on which a lot of companies aren't", "43:50", "talking about is the role of the gut in", "43:52", "the mind in conjunction with your", "43:53", "physical training so essentially what we", "43:55", "do is we start off with a really", "43:56", "comprehensive baseline assessment we", "43:59", "want to run them through everything so", "44:00", "the traditional functional threshold", "44:02", "powers autonomic nervous system DC brain", "44:05", "potentials really what you want to do is", "44:06", "you want to put somebody on a on a", "44:07", "normal curve what is a DC brain", "44:09", "potential DC brain potentials daniel", "44:12", "cormier yes a little bit but basically", "44:17", "it's an objective measurement of your", "44:19", "central nervous system so you can", "44:20", "actually your central nervous system is", "44:22", "basically the data aggregator if you", "44:24", "will so it has to take information from", "44:25", "your metabolic systems your autonomic", "44:27", "s-- kind of coordinate things like", "44:29", "neuromuscular and metabolic efficiency", "44:31", "that's kind of the data center if you", "44:33", "will so this is a measurement of", "44:35", "potential basically how much energy you", "44:37", "have in the central nervous system to go", "44:39", "coordinate narrow muscular and metabolic", "44:41", "efficiencies which is really what we", "44:42", "focus on so so is this on like a chart", "44:45", "are you getting it like is there a", "44:47", "number reading that you're getting like", "44:49", "what is it that correct specifically for", "44:51", "DCs it's going to be in millivolts and", "44:53", "then you just compare that to normative", "44:54", "ranges but most importantly what it is", "44:56", "is trending data over time this is an", "44:58", "assessment that we would do on Henry", "44:59", "every single morning it's a home test", "45:01", "kit we really believe in just collecting", "45:03", "as much data as possible and trending", "45:04", "data that way when you see a change", "45:06", "essentially get predictability in terms", "45:08", "of now today is a no-go day because", "45:11", "central nervous system is diminished", "45:13", "we're just going to be going through the", "45:13", "motions we're not going to make", "45:14", "physiological adaptations and your", "45:17", "inflammation is really high no-go", "45:19", "because we're not going to go risk", "45:20", "injury when we can't make adaptations so", "45:22", "this is a measurement we would do every", "45:23", "single morning where we can look at", "45:24", "anomic nervous system which is basically", "45:27", "things like recovery sympathetic", "45:28", "parasympathetic balance DC brain", "45:30", "potentials and metabolic systems what is", "45:33", "what is measuring all these things is", "45:34", "their device yeah yeah this is a pretty", "45:37", "amazing device we actually got it from", "45:39", "the UFC Performance Institute", "45:40", "you know shoutout to those guys Clint", "45:42", "bow and Roman over there set us up with", "45:44", "this technology it's a basically a chest", "45:46", "strap that does heart rate variability", "45:47", "so time and frequency domain analysis", "45:50", "and then it does DC brain potential so a", "45:52", "little sticker right here on your", "45:53", "forehead basically four minutes you just", "45:56", "kind of relax and we collect pretty", "45:58", "amazing data and it breaks it down into", "45:59", "four different categories what's called", "46:01", "windows of trainability so it says today", "46:03", "we should focus on strength and power or", "46:05", "skill acquisition based on metabolic", "46:07", "readiness autonomic readiness and DC", "46:09", "brain potentials", "46:10", "so what is our body primed to go do", "46:12", "today because if you're not primed your", "46:14", "nervous system doesn't have the energy", "46:16", "it's going to be going through the", "46:17", "motions so you're sort of there to", "46:19", "dictate when it's gonna be a hard day", "46:21", "when it's gonna be an easy day correct", "46:23", "yeah and that's something as you I'm", "46:25", "sure you guys know in wrestling it's", "46:26", "it's always hard always let's go so this", "46:29", "was a little bit of an issue in the camp", "46:30", "at the very beginning if you could", "46:32", "imagine henry wakes up it's a sparring", "46:34", "day where maybe even supposed to do two", "46:35", "a days he wakes up feeling really good", "46:37", "and nervous system is out of whack it's", "46:40", "like sorry man I know you feel good but", "46:42", "you're not you know yeah so we would go", "46:45", "a no-go that day and you know as you", "46:47", "could see it all worked out in the long", "46:49", "run it worked out fantastic but was that", "46:51", "weird for you to feel good and then to", "46:53", "be told you got to chill out yeah yeah", "46:55", "there was it almost takes a while to", "46:58", "kind of adapt but I started as I started", "47:00", "recognizing like my body change and how", "47:02", "I felt in sparring or how they were and", "47:04", "how kind of I just felt recovered I was", "47:07", "like God this is this is crazy like I", "47:09", "didn't run at all this whole camp so do", "47:12", "you get a baseline off of this - Erik", "47:14", "you gotta stop moving around you're", "47:15", "freaking me out he's doing hand signals", "47:17", "back to me so what do you do a baseline", "47:22", "on this before you get started and then", "47:25", "you as before camp get started and then", "47:28", "when camp starts ramping up then you", "47:30", "start measuring all the various details", "47:31", "correct yeah so we do a comprehensive", "47:33", "baseline assessment including the Omega", "47:35", "wave as well as you know six or eight", "47:37", "hours of other testing everything that", "47:38", "you could think of Under the Sun and we", "47:40", "put together basically columns of this", "47:42", "is what your suboptimal at this is what", "47:44", "your average at this is what your really", "47:45", "damn good at so basically what we want", "47:47", "to do is explore your functional", "47:48", "strengths it's what you're good at but", "47:50", "then we also want to focus on your", "47:51", "functional deficiencies in a sport like", "47:54", "MMA we also sometimes have the advantage", "47:56", "of looking at your opponent and making", "47:57", "certain assumptions in terms of their", "47:59", "weaknesses their strengths going against", "48:01", "somebody like DJ you don't you don't", "48:02", "really have that advantage so we really", "48:04", "needed to focus on is what Henry is", "48:05", "really good at his ground game you look", "48:07", "you know we're doing nervous system", "48:08", "assessments while he's on the ground his", "48:11", "sparring partners or stress systems are", "48:13", "going like crazy he's calming down", "48:15", "because this guy likes to be on the", "48:16", "floor rolling around so we pinpoint", "48:18", "these little strategic to strengths and", "48:20", "deficiencies and then we target all of", "48:22", "this nutrition supplementation", "48:24", "a big thing that we focus on is nutrient", "48:26", "timing something that's not really", "48:27", "talked about as well but when you're", "48:29", "talking about gut health and you know", "48:31", "recovery managing that the hormones", "48:32", "associated with exercise you got to be", "48:34", "getting in the right nutrients in your", "48:36", "your energy and a Baalak and growth", "48:38", "phases so for nutrient timing you're", "48:40", "talking about like when you're actually", "48:42", "eating and what you're eating so you're", "48:43", "planning that out as well", "48:44", "a hundred percent yeah so we put", "48:46", "together a nutrition program and because", "48:48", "training varies every morning we're", "48:50", "deciding what we're going to do for the", "48:51", "day it's completely dynamic so we're", "48:53", "kind of reinventing the game of", "48:54", "periodization and programming because", "48:56", "you can't give somebody an eight-week", "48:58", "plan you have to check every single day", "49:00", "this is how you stay very dynamic and", "49:02", "you avoid plateaus and just the issues", "49:04", "you know it's always going to lead to", "49:05", "suboptimal performance if you're", "49:06", "programming out so every day we adjust", "49:09", "you know we're doing this intensity of", "49:10", "training we did a vo2 max assessment so", "49:12", "we know exactly how much glycogen you're", "49:14", "burning at various levels of intensity", "49:16", "we do heart rate tracking during your", "49:18", "training all right this is exactly what", "49:20", "you have to replace following so I'm", "49:22", "standing on the sidelines you know after", "49:23", "every practice mixing up custom", "49:25", "supplements for him as well so this is", "49:27", "something what kind of stuff um you know", "49:29", "we have our own supplement line right", "49:30", "now frankly not because the world needed", "49:32", "another supplement line it's not really", "49:34", "what our goal was in in sports like this", "49:36", "you have to be so careful what you're", "49:37", "putting these guys body so we just went", "49:39", "the route of going GMP certified wada", "49:41", "you saw it approved on everything we do", "49:43", "eventually we want to you know try and", "49:45", "work with the baddest company because", "49:47", "we're not we don't want to be in the", "49:47", "supplement game for us it was just", "49:49", "quality control so being a nervous", "49:52", "system based company obviously we're", "49:53", "doing things like omega-3 DHA s BCAAs", "49:57", "you don't have to maintain put on a", "49:58", "little bit of muscle we do a lot a big", "50:01", "one I believe in the generation you can", "50:03", "the super starch very good without a big", "50:05", "glycemic and a big insulin response but", "50:07", "very good at replenishing your glycogen", "50:08", "stores following to minimize cortisol", "50:11", "and inflammatory responses and things", "50:13", "like that so every day it's a little bit", "50:15", "different but yeah we ended up going", "50:17", "with our own line and one of the biggest", "50:18", "things that we we never really talked", "50:20", "about in the fight as well is the role", "50:21", "that gut health plays so that's", "50:23", "something Henry does year-round", "50:24", "regardless of when we're fighting is", "50:25", "take our line which is called freedom", "50:27", "cleanse restore this is world renowned", "50:29", "you know utilized by university", "50:31", "researchers all around the world right", "50:33", "now and basically it's all just about", "50:35", "restoring good gut bacteria prebiotics", "50:37", "probiotics", "50:38", "like some lymphatic cleansing and this", "50:40", "is gonna be something I'm that really", "50:42", "played a big role in his weight cut as", "50:43", "well it's kind of a missing link that", "50:45", "athletes

you", "54:05", "know you understand I mean I do feel", "54:16", "honored and blessed to be able to work", "54:18", "with somebody like Henry he's the", "54:19", "hardest-working guy out there and and

"traditional strength training because", "55:08", "you know a lot of people just it's", "55:09", "called vector-based training so a lot of", "55:11", "people do things like squats and", "55:13",

"55:20", "force and very effectively and very", "55:22", "really does that come down to actually", "55:24", "utilizing weights we do things like", "55:26", "positional isometrics and eccentric",

"what kind of like planks I mean that's", "55:38", "that's kind of a low level of it yeah", "55:39", "largely what you would want to do is", "55:40", "like a biomechanical assessment look at", "55:42", "overactive and underactive muscles and", "55:44", "you put them in very specific positions", "55:46", "and you leverage what's called", "55:47", "reciprocal inhibition so basically and", "55:50", "then the most basic turn like when I'm", "55:52", "flexing my bicep my tricep is relaxing", "55:54", "so you'd hold certain positions that you", "55:56", "want to turn on certain muscles and kind", "55:57", "of turn off other ones and it's kind of", "55:59", "a high level of PNF stretching", "56:01", "proprioceptive neuromuscular", "56:03", "facilitation so this is what would be", "56:05", "done in like a PT office so what in like", "56:09", "for wrestling like what kind of", "56:11", "exercises would you do that wouldn't", "56:13", "incorporate those methods", "56:15", "I mean wrestling is you know largely a", "56:16", "torsional sport so when it comes to", "56:18", "wrestling we do things like like Kaiser", "56:20", "like pneumatic compressions and things", "56:21", "like that so instead of using weights we", "56:23", "use air pressure basically it's very", "56:25", "smooth very low risk of injury and they", "56:27", "live in this um this torsional plane so", "56:29", "you do a lot of transverse plane and we", "56:31", "do a lot of velocity based training as", "56:33", "well actually really interesting a study", "56:35", "that was published recently they had a", "56:37", "lot of guys working out it for a full", "56:38", "year", "56:39", "some only did velocity never actually", "56:41", "picked up a weight the other ones did", "56:42", "traditional strength training the people", "56:44", "who did velocity based training not no", "56:46", "actual weight training got stronger with", "56:48", "less muscular hypertrophy I mean they", "56:50", "didn't get as big but they were stronger", "56:52", "at the end of the day so when you look", "56:54", "at something like wrestling and MMA", "56:55", "where you got to make a low weight but", "56:57", "you want to be strong as possible", "56:58", "you know velocity based training is kind", "57:00", "of the way of the future so this is kind", "57:02", "of our general gym concept that we're", "57:03", "building right now is is you know the", "57:05", "gym of the future may not need weights", "57:07", "you know you we're gonna be next door to", "57:08", "these CrossFit gyms where they're", "57:10", "throwing all these weights over their", "57:11", "head getting injured or next door empty", "57:13", "gym and people are getting stronger", "57:14", "that's that's kind of the gym of the", "57:16", "future the way we see it how would you", "57:18", "Vonn velocity based training so", "57:21", "basically what you want to do is it's", "57:22", "kind of like the new one rep max we all", "57:24", "know wonder if Max's aren't the safest", "57:25", "thing to perform right so you would", "57:27", "there's different assessments actually", "57:29", "what I'm wearing here on my wrist right", "57:30", "now this is the wearable tech of the", "57:32", "future this is something we're testing", "57:33", "right now this does velocity so I could", "57:35", "stand in any position I could do a push", "57:37", "press or I could do a punch this is", "57:39", "going to measure my velocity your max", "57:41", "velocity at no weight would be your one", "57:43", "rep max velocity basically and then", "57:45", "you're going and you're doing your", "57:46", "training so max velocity every single", "57:48", "rep when you hit 20 percent dampening so", "57:51", "say I was at 10 meters per second as", "57:52", "soon as I hit 8 meter 8 meters per", "57:54", "second I stop so this is kind of what", "57:56", "they call fatigue so you stop that so", "57:59", "instead of doing you know you're gonna", "58:00", "do 8 reps you do as many reps as you can", "58:02", "until you reach a certain dampening of", "58:03", "velocity and what are you doing them", "58:05", "with um largely things like the Kaiser", "58:08", "the functional trainer if you're", "58:09", "familiar with blasting band work yeah", "58:12", "things like that I mean very really will", "58:13", "throw like you know Indian clubs and", "58:15", "things like that in there as well so it", "58:16", "all depends on the sport and what we're", "58:18", "focusing on that day you know metabolic", "58:20", "readiness things along those lines but", "58:22", "it's all just about training in the", "58:24", "right vectors and being able to not only", "58:26", "put out for us but absorb force as well", "58:28", "which nobody really talks about if you", "58:30", "look at largely other professional", "58:31", "sports all these injuries are happening", "58:33", "in the deceleration phase so when people", "58:35", "are trying to slow down this is", "58:36", "absorbing force this is kind of similar", "58:38", "through some of the pieces that just", "58:40", "aren't trained in MMA as well it's got", "58:42", "to be able to absorb force just like you", "58:43", "put it out now when you met this risk", "58:46", "thing that you're wearing it measures", "58:48", "velocity so how is it doing that so", "58:52", "basically I have one here and then I", "58:53", "have one on my shoe as well so it can do", "58:55", "it by using two sensors it can measure", "58:57", "relative velocity so it's reading one", "58:59", "relative to the other this is also doing", "59:01", "everything that a badass traditional", "59:03", "wearable would do as well so it's doing", "59:04", "my heart rate heart rate variability", "59:06", "which is actually clinical grade", "59:08", "everything we do has got to be clinical", "59:09", "grade because what's the point of", "59:10", "collecting data if it's shit right and", "59:12", "then it does pulse oximetry so I'm", "59:14", "looking at my oxygen saturation the next", "59:16", "version is going to be able to do", "59:18", "hydration all kinds of badass stuff", "59:20", "what's really cool about it as well as", "59:22", "it can measure form any exercise that", "59:24", "you're doing we can compare you", "59:25", "essentially to an ideal form and because", "59:28", "we have to you don't even have to tell", "59:29", "it you're doing a power clean it can", "59:30", "read your motions", "59:31", "things like that and it gives you like a", "59:33", "consistency number as well so we one", "59:36", "thing we really talked about is not", "59:37", "building muscle on top of dysfunction we", "59:40", "have to get your biomechanical patterns", "59:41", "right first and then we start putting", "59:43", "muscle on if you just put muscle on top", "59:44", "of dysfunction you're facilitating", "59:47", "further dysfunction would you have to", "59:48", "wear one of those on each hand I mean", "59:50", "I'd say the the ideally for someone like", "59:53", "a fighter you obviously are throwing", "59:54", "with both hands I think it would be", "59:56", "ideal it's it's really difficult to time", "59:59", "sink multiple devices to be on the same", "60:01", "timeline so that's something we're", "60:02", "working with this company an amazing", "60:04", "company actually out of here at LA to", "60:06", "develop this thing right now so that I", "60:08", "would say that would be the goal it's", "60:09", "not something that's gonna be applicable", "60:10", "to the average guy though as well.this", "60:12", "we're trying to bring this type of", "60:13", "training to everybody", "60:14", "would it be possible instead of time", "60:17", "syncing it you have a left in the right", "60:19", "computer like two different computers", "60:20", "that are reading data both on one off", "60:22", "the left one off the right so you don't", "60:24", "have to coordinate them you just look at", "60:25", "the the various data yeah I mean at the", "60:27", "end of the day you still would have to", "60:28", "sync them you know so the thing there", "60:30", "you'd be collecting it in two different", "60:32", "sets of hardware you'd want an API", "60:33", "connectivity put it up in the cloud and", "60:35", "then you'd still at the end of the day", "60:36", "have to find the same time axis so it", "60:39", "sounds simpler than it really would be", "60:41", "that's why this is the only wearable in", "60:42", "the world right now that has even one in", "60:44", "the foot and so this also allows you to", "60:45", "track your gait while you're running and", "60:47", "things as well but the more devices the", "60:49", "more complex in in yellow that's", "60:51", "something I think would be great but", "60:52", "maybe not applicable to everybody is it", "60:54", "going to be able to track martial arts", "60:56", "moves like will it be able to track a", "60:57", "double leg takedown or a roundhouse kick", "61:00", "right now you can program it to do", "61:02", "anything you put it into a kind of like", "61:04", "a learning mode on your app you do a few", "61:06", "motions you name it and then it can can", "61:08", "basically compare you to yourself in", "61:10", "that mode so you can try and do perfect", "61:12", "form and measure your form relative to", "61:14", "yourself but if you have shitty form", "61:16", "you're comparing yourself to shit before", "61:18", "exactly so doesn't know any better", "61:20", "exactly so what we're doing right now on", "61:22", "which which will be a little bit of a", "61:23", "lengthy process is defining a library of", "61:25", "perfect form for everything that you", "61:27", "could think of and then this you know", "61:28", "this is going to lock telehealth and", "61:30", "tell the training when you have", "61:31", "something like that we can do remote", "61:33", "programming and and have be you know be", "61:35", "monitoring people's neuromuscular", "61:36", "function their biomechanics completely", "61:38", "remotely so that's that's really what", "61:39", "we're going towards wow this is", "61:41", "fascinating stuff man you know there's", "61:43", "always been several aspects to", "61:45", "a fighter ready for camp there's always", "61:46", "been their skill set what what they're", "61:49", "good at specific training for that one", "61:52", "individual opponent that they're gonna", "61:53", "face and then all the strength and", "61:56", "conditioning and you know it's usually", "61:58", "thought of as you know weights and", "62:00", "sprints and plows and on all these", "62:02", "different things but I feel like this is", "62:04", "probably the next step the next step", "62:06", "measuring all of your all these", "62:09", "variables that you're talking about and", "62:10", "and seeing how your body is at any given", "62:13", "time so that you're not just guessing", "62:15", "whether you're peaking your", "62:17", "scientifically peaking exactly I mean", "62:19", "there's there's just no room for", "62:20", "guesswork and subjectivity you know at", "62:22", "this level and technology doesn't", "62:24", "there's no need for it anymore so we're", "62:26", "just trying to let people know shit like", "62:27", "this is available right so we're", "62:29", "developing it and then the end goal is", "62:31", "just to make it extremely user friendly", "62:32", "right so you're doing your your troop", "62:34", "velocity based training and it says stop", "62:36", "and then you rest and we're using your", "62:37", "heart rate variability to tell you when", "62:39", "to go again so like you know is easy to", "62:41", "stop and go for your periodization and", "62:43", "things like that so that the", "62:45", "technologies here now making it you know", "62:46", "actionable recommendations for the", "62:49", "individual that can understand is kind", "62:50", "of what we're moving towards this is", "62:52", "awesome stuff man thank you yeah we're", "62:54", "really passionate that you've only been", "62:56", "around for such a short amount of time -", "62:58", "and yet you already have a world", "62:59", "champion oh I know man I mean I feel you", "63:02", "know there's times where you feel like", "63:03", "you didn't deserve the opportunity", "63:04", "because I'm new to the field you know we", "63:06", "obviously work our asses off and", "63:07", "everything but the for Henry to put the", "63:09", "faith into us you know this was a world", "63:11", "champion camp we're a company also we're", "63:13", "not even open yet where this is you know", "63:15", "probably one of the best acceleration", "63:17", "for a company that's never seen the", "63:18", "light of day ever you know we also heard", "63:20", "on a few other sports as well but yet", "63:22", "for him to give us this opportunity and", "63:24", "you know we felt like we we owed him", "63:26", "something so we we worked extra hard to", "63:28", "essentially put our entire company on", "63:29", "hold for eight weeks that you go help", "63:31", "him out and you know it's paying", "63:32", "dividends obviously if we're here right", "63:34", "now so now are you guys gonna be open to", "63:36", "the general public say the the average", "63:38", "girl or guy who does say jiu-jitsu", "63:41", "tournaments and wants to get in the best", "63:42", "shape of their life is you're gonna have", "63:44", "products for them and and a service", "63:47", "where they can sign up for something", "63:48", "like that certainly right now we are", "63:50", "already open in terms of diagnostic", "63:52", "testing so you can come in based on your", "63:54", "sport your goal whatever it may be we do", "63:56", "have customized diagnostic pack", "63:58", "just because some assessments just", "64:00", "aren't applicable to some people so we", "64:01", "customize your assessment we basically", "64:03", "tell you what you're good at what you're", "64:04", "bad at then if you want to you know", "64:06", "develop a program that's a little bit of", "64:08", "an upcharge that the real goal there is", "64:09", "to be able to do completely remote", "64:11", "training completely in-house training", "64:14", "and then any level of hybrid training as", "64:15", "well so right now you know what the", "64:17", "world needs is that diagnostic testing", "64:19", "the data we're already ready to do that", "64:21", "what we're building now is the processes", "64:23", "of being able to use data put it into", "64:25", "recommendations and then scale that it's", "64:27", "hard to teach somebody you know", "64:28", "everything that I do so we're building", "64:30", "the you know the software's to", "64:32", "essentially replicate ourselves like my", "64:34", "buddy in the other room Andre Hicks one", "64:35", "of the best strength and conditioning", "64:37", "coaches in the world these guys will", "64:38", "attest to it", "64:39", "you can't teach people what he knows so", "64:41", "we have to like code this into a", "64:43", "software a lot of if-then type stuff and", "64:45", "then this is able to be scalable to", "64:47", "everybody we want to provide this", "64:48", "training to people now the average Joe", "64:52", "trying to lose weight you know the", "64:53",

risk of injury high-yield return", "65:03", "efficient that's what everyone's looking", "65:05", "for and that's that's why you know the", "65:07", "people are getting fatter there's", "65:08",

"70:10", "almost train according to how how you", "70:12", "know what this how the schedule is", "70:14", "rather than okay this is this is this is", "70:16", "the approach today because this is sorry", "70:18", "this is how your stress levels are yeah", "70:20", "like relax dude and then and then at", "70:22", "times you're gonna go hard and it's", "70:24", "it'll spike you at times it's crazy well", "70:28", "that's the the crazy contrast right is", "70:29", "between this championship mentality that", "70:32", "just wants to do more", "70:33", "than anybody push harder train while", "70:36", "everybody else is asleep put your body", "70:38", "through more than anybody else is", "70:39", "willing to do because that's what makes", "70:41", "a champion and then someone like you", "70:43", "comes along goes no that's way more", "70:44", "that's what he fucks you up you slow", "70:47", "down you do last less rounds move slower", "70:50", "yeah exactly I mean that was one of the", "70:52", "biggest things I told him if you're not", "70:53", "sleeping 8 to 10 hours a night when", "70:55", "you're putting your body through some", "70:56", "like you're doing your body and", "70:57", "injustice and you're not gonna make", "70:58", "adaptations when we're out there", "71:00", "training or breaking our body down it", "71:02", "needs this repair we need you know", "71:04", "activate our glymphatic system our", "71:05", "brains waste removal system as well so", "71:07", "we can go learn some new things the next", "71:09", "day as well so if you're not sleeping", "71:10", "you're suboptimal just like you're not", "71:12", "properly hydrated and things as well as", "71:14", "so this is all comes down to the", "71:15", "cellular level you know nervous system", "71:17", "based approach now are you taking", "71:20", "melatonin or anything to ensure that you", "71:23", "go to sleep at a specific time do you", "71:25", "time your sleep sky schedule like how", "71:27", "are you organizing that yeah I think I", "71:30", "think and that's another thing even at", "71:32", "times according to when I would go to", "71:35", "sleep because at times you know how you", "71:36", "train late and sometimes you come back", "71:38", "and it just takes your water go to sleep", "71:40", "yeah so even then it would it would be", "71:42", "like all right when when Henry's ready", "71:44", "to wake up when he obviously if I don't", "71:46", "hit my alarm and I snooze it I'm more", "71:48", "lucky they can allow me to sleep an", "71:50", "extra two hours mmm we're so important", "71:53", "yeah so it's like the fight it's kind of", "71:54", "like what Floyd does boy we'll be like", "71:56", "hey wake everybody up at 3:00 in the", "71:57", "morning but there's no scientific to", "71:59", "what Floyd's doing like to us it's like", "72:01", "hey dude let's we have to peak today so", "72:03", "I've always wondered if there is science", "72:05", "behind it and he just doesn't talk about", "72:10", "yeah think so", "72:11", "yeah like when he drinks a Pepsi after a", "72:14", "workout I was like I wonder there's no", "72:16", "science I told him to do that to", "72:19", "replenish his body with a ton of sugar", "72:21", "high glycemic carbs right after that's", "72:23", "the only time it's really good that 45", "72:25", "window of insulin sensitivity so I do", "72:27", "believe that one technology we while", "72:30", "we're on the sleep thing one that we", "72:31", "were utilizing for Henry", "72:32", "just a little light microcurrent here to", "72:34", "your temporal lobes and it's proven to", "72:36", "increase serotonin and melatonin and", "72:38", "decrease cortisol so we're like", "72:40", "manipulating bio chemicals and it's a", "72:42", "very natural way of making you feel", "72:43", "drowsy would totally do that we would do", "72:46", "that immediate", "72:47", "following every rigorous training", "72:48", "session to kind of like negate", "72:50", "inflammatory responses and things like", "72:52", "that you know get you back into that", "72:53", "anabolic phase as quickly as possible", "72:55", "and then ideally right before bed every", "72:57", "single night did you feel like a science", "72:59", "project while all this shit was going on", "73:00", "I did I did actually did a presentation", "73:02", "on me in Russia with Roman with with the", "73:06", "scientists that they have at the US EPA", "73:08", "like they tracked everything according", "73:09", "to the Omega wear the device that we", "73:11", "were using and he was able to kind of", "73:13", "show it was like hey look my system", "73:16", "might you know this system does work you", "73:19", "know it's just like people were kind of", "73:20", "just tripping out so I was I went out", "73:22", "there did the whole presentation with in", "73:24", "Moscow and everybody was just kind of", "73:27", "just like there everybody was kind of", "73:28", "like wow I mean someone works kind of", "73:30", "scratching their head is a little like", "73:31", "damn that's that's cool you're able to", "73:35", "kind of see how I peaked for this fight", "73:37", "and how I was able to kind of survive", "73:38", "five rounds the Russians have really", "73:40", "been pioneering this type of training", "73:43", "for quite a while specifically the the", "73:46", "type of training like that Pavel", "73:48", "Tatooine uses like where you're using", "73:51", "way less energy you're working out way", "73:53", "less but you're getting better results", "73:55", "from it like there's there's a lot of", "73:58", "thought processes that have been leaning", "74:00", "in this direction from a like a lot of", "74:02", "really high level top coaches for quite", "74:04", "a while now yeah I know and it's cool to", "74:06", "see it because I come from a traditional", "74:08", "sport where you put your head down and", "74:09", "you go that's wrestling wrestling and", "74:12", "what I think they're very uh very alike", "74:15", "in that sense like they're very", "74:16", "traditional like the harder you go the", "74:18", "more you push through injury the you", "74:20", "know the better you will become yeah I", "74:22", "also think that there's something to be", "74:24", "said for that though in terms of mental", "74:26", "strength because one of the things that", "74:28", "wrestlers have that is it's not just", "74:31", "that they have a great skill and being", "74:32", "able to manipulate bodies but they also", "74:34", "have mental toughness that's at a level", "74:37", "that I don't think you get from any", "74:38", "other sport I mean I think there's a lot", "74:40", "of pro athletes even tennis players that", "74:42", "are just mentally tough they're just", "74:44", "tough so people just know how to win", "74:46", "they know how to push themselves but I", "74:48", "feel like wrestlers are on another level", "74:50", "because they're always tired they're", "74:52", "always over trained they're always", "74:54", "dehydrated and they're always working", "74:56", "out with a bunch of fucking savages", "74:58", "all the same way and everybody takes", "75:00", "pleasure in being miserable oh yeah", "75:02", "there's something to that they like you", "75:05", "see it man I've seen thousands of fights", "75:07", "you see there's something about", "75:09", "wrestlers they have just like an extra", "75:11", "gear like a high-level wrestler in", "75:13", "particular has an extra gear that a lot", "75:16", "of other fighters just never developed", "75:17", "yeah it's almost like I tell people", "75:20", "wrestling's not it's almost like not a", "75:22", "sport man it's like a culture yes it's", "75:25", "like that you're just you're in the", "75:26", "culture of wrestling and once you have", "75:28", "that it's almost uh there's an honor to", "75:30", "it there's a warrior to it and I get it", "75:33", "so yeah it's it's it I was just at the", "75:36", "World Championship show and I can tell", "75:38", "you man the best athletes in the world I", "75:41", "was just a Budapest Hungary and I saw", "75:43", "how Snider and all these guys compete", "75:44", "and I'm just like man these are the more", "75:47", "these are the best athletes and well", "75:49", "this is the hardest shit a human being", "75:50", "could ever do yeah if you're to see the", "75:52", "finesse and the strength and the power", "75:54", "and what's involved and becoming a world", "75:57", "champion and watching these guys go", "75:58", "through this freakin tux just a tough", "76:01", "the toughest tournament in the world and", "76:02", "it's uh I think I think what we do in", "76:06", "mmm is fun compared to compared to", "76:07", "wrestling I really do like that stuff is", "76:12", "like my stuff is hard what these guys go", "76:14", "through the win a tournament like it's", "76:16", "the weight cuts the you know they don't", "76:19", "get paid a lot of money right like these", "76:21", "dudes are wrong for the globe yeah oh", "76:24", "yeah each and every one it's all glory", "76:26", "there's no financial reward at all", "76:27", "that's what's fascinating about it but", "76:29", "it's it's just interesting to me that I", "76:31", "think you kind of need both in some", "76:35", "weird way your mind needs to develop", "76:38", "this this layer of toughness that", "76:40", "wrestlers have and then I think once", "76:43", "you've developed that then maybe I think", "76:45", "your approach Kevin is is like", "76:48", "applicable but I think that until an", "76:51", "athlete has that indomitable spirit", "76:53", "until they have that sort of that iron", "76:56", "will that a wrestler possesses it's", "76:59", "theirs to make a champion I think you", "77:01", "need many many things but I don't think", "77:04", "you can ever discount that ability to", "77:06", "work through discomfort the way", "77:08", "wrestlers have I just don't think it's", "77:10", "wise as a professional", "77:11", "athlete of the championship level to", "77:13", "compete compromised Oh agreed yeah you", "77:16", "know there there's the intangibles the", "77:17", "stuff that you just can't teach you", "77:19", "can't quantify you know so we do our", "77:21", "best to quantify as much as we can but", "77:23", "yeah I mean I completely agree there's", "77:25", "you got to put in the time in the work", "77:27", "to learn the skill at some point and", "77:28", "then once you know it's autonomic the", "77:30", "skills master that's when you can kind", "77:32", "of put take it back into our method I'm", "77:33", "gonna I'm gonna agree with you Joe I", "77:35", "think I'm gonna agree with you and I", "77:36", "think the reason why this works for", "77:38", "pretty much every MMA fighters because", "77:40", "we've all been through hell yeah I can", "77:42", "order for you to see and believe in", "77:44", "Sciences you have to go through how to", "77:45", "understand like hey man the hard way", "77:47", "probably is it the best way but when you", "77:49", "were talking about your your the feeling", "77:53", "that you had and not wanting to ever", "77:55", "feel the pain of losing again that", "77:58", "feeling that you had when your ankle was", "78:00", "going out and that you like fuck this no", "78:03", "no I'm not doing this I'm gonna find a", "78:05", "way out of this like you almost have to", "78:08", "experience lows in order to have that", "78:11", "and I feel like that one of the things", "78:13", "about wrestling that makes it a sport", "78:16", "that creates so many fucking savages is", "78:19", "because you go through so much shit so", "78:23", "much hardship so so much difficulty that", "78:27", "you know if you had science-based", "78:30", "wrestling programs the way you're doing", "78:32", "his science-based camp and you went in", "78:34", "and you know said everybody you gotta", "78:36", "slow down slow down you know like you're", "78:38", "going too hard slow down you can't run", "78:40", "up hills today you know your your your", "78:42", "DC brain waves or a wrestling coach", "78:45", "should be like shut the fuck up and sit", "78:47", "- who is this asshole", "78:48", "yeah like Dan Gable brought you in a", "78:50", "camp and you guys are running around", "78:52", "doing all this stuff he'd be like what", "78:53", "like what are you saying like this is", "78:56", "how we make champions yeah yeah yeah but", "78:58", "it like I said I think you hit the nail", "78:59", "on the head I think it's for to me the", "79:01", "way I would see there's like you have to", "79:03", "kind of go through how or no", "79:04", "understanding because you had to go", "79:06", "through that Callister that burn yeah", "79:07", "but I feel like especially in MMA a lot", "79:10", "of athletes or even athletes just in", "79:12", "general they everybody buses are BOTS", "79:14", "almost if you're an elite athlete like", "79:16", "you you'll always train maybe not the", "79:17", "smartest way yeah you know I get some", "79:22", "yeah I guess you could add more to to", "79:25", "your training or take away less if", "79:28", "there's a me but there's a fine line to", "79:30", "it yeah the fine line is what's", "79:32", "fascinating to me yeah like one of the", "79:35", "things that I love about MMA is that", "79:36", "it's so broad there are so many skills", "79:38", "that the approach to success is", "79:42", "different with every individual and you", "79:44", "have to find what that approach is like", "79:46", "the approach to you for your for you for", "79:49", "you to achieve success is going to be", "79:51", "different than they approach for a", "79:52", "different athlete it does doesn't have", "79:54", "the same skills that you have", "79:55", "but like Anderson Silva perfect example", "79:58", "he's not a wrestler he's gonna have a", "79:59", "different different approach there's", "80:02", "going to be different things that they", "80:04", "work on in training there's gonna be a", "80:05", "different mindset it's gonna be a", "80:07", "different way of preparing right right", "80:09", "and it's all according to everybody", "80:10", "according like not it's I think a lot of", "80:13", "things are cookie cutter like looking at", "80:14", "it the way now it's like a lot of things", "80:16", "have have stayed even in wrestling like", "80:20", "just over tradition you know

now would you rather", "86:42", "fight him at 35 so you can get an", "86:44", "additional title or would you rather", "86:46", "fight him at 35 because you don't have", "86:47", "to cut weight or I

"87:34", "right now I mean is that one reason like", "87:38", "if you won at 35 and won the title of 35", "87:41", "would you consider dropping the 25 pound", "87:43", "title and competing at 35 or would you", "87:45", "rather stay at 25 oh I would I wouldn't", "87:48", "mind I wouldn't mind dabbling in both I", "87:50", "mean I know that's that's kind of has", "87:52", "kind of broad but you

pounds is", "88:06", "way better than losing 25 yeah I'm a", "88:09", "little I'm a little bigger now because", "88:12", "of because of that reason I might I", "88:14", "might have to fight at a bad time so I'm", "88:16", "kind of I think more like him it might", "88:19", "happen that bad him way what people", "88:22", "don't know is that actually Henry almost", "88:24", "fought TJ when he was

sort of Forge it with", "93:31", "quit with some sort of like severe", "93:33", "discipline yeah there has to be a", "93:36", "training of the mind to and I think", "93:38", "that's where people are skipping and you", "93:42", "know I think that's that's where you had", "93:44", "to understand like the philosophy up", "93:46", "here like you have to you have to be", "93:48", "right up top you don't write you have to", "93:51", "be you have to be literally you have to", "93:53", "understand and know who you are as a", "93:55", "fighter as a person and you know to kind", "93:58", "of to be

like man", "94:28", "there's there's something missing and", "94:30", "then you you you you're terrified you're", "94:32", "gonna see that in yourself and I think", "94:34", "it's the embracement", "94:35", "of embracing pressure mmm it's something", "94:38", "that you don't neglect or sometimes you", "94:39", "don't shy away from something that you", "94:41", "don't allow damn it", "94:42", "to damage you but it's an embracement", "94:44", "it's a it's a sigh hey bring it man", "94:46", "bring because that's what it is Joe it's", "94:48", "the pressure that people feel the reason", "94:49",

in", "96:02", "this prime and it's almost like there's", "96:03", "no doubt but it was it was because of", "96:05", "the game planning then you ended the", "96:06", "greatest winning streak in the
