totally makes sense yeah my footwork", "41:47", "pattern and everything is from karate", "41:48", "this is this where I get it from", "41:51", "springing in like that you know the", "41:53", "ability to cover that distance that's a", "41:54", "huge advantage", "41:55", "cover this and to not get hit this very", "41:59", "important right yeah and that is one of", "42:01", "the cornerstones of those tournaments", "42:04", "and in that style did you have a hard", "42:07", "time when you made a transition to move", "42:10", "and MMA style it today today with my", "42:13", "kicks or lime or like

just regular", "42:56", "muy Thai now than anything else", "42:58", "because I think all those techniques", "43:01", "like the spinning back kick and wheel", "43:02", "kick for a guy like you that has like a", "43:04", "strong karate background or guy who", "43:06", "picks things up really quickly that's", "43:08", "you know those are good techniques to", "43:10", "learn but like for everyday use it's", "43:14", "hard to pull those things off unless", "43:16", "you're doing it on a regular basis like", "43:18", "they become normal when you're fighting", "43:21", "and talk about no tournaments and", "43:21", "everybody's doing it you're doing it", "43:23", "every day but at MMA there's so many", "43:24", "other fucking things like to have the", "43:27", "the type of leg dexterity that you

like specific things", "44:28", "and this is in between fights so you", "44:30", "don't have a fight scheduled so now", "44:32", "you're just in the skill development", "44:34", "phase as though it is", "44:35", "yeah and that's where my training is fun", "44:36", "because I trained for myself to get", "44:39", "better and I try stuff like now you see", "44:42", "me if I go roll with my friend like it", "44:44", "is Academy I roll I try stuff that I", "44:46", "would maybe not have the guts to try a", "44:49", "normal time because it's risky so so I", "44:52", "try it oh I get up and you know I tap", "44:54", "and I laugh who cares I tap I don't I", "44:56", "don't care some time I tap him some time", "44:57", "I get that but but when I train for a", "45:00", "training camp", "45:00",

"training is not as fun as it is now", "45:12", "right yeah the ability to loosen up in", "45:16", "training is very important when you're", "45:18", "in the learning phase right yes yes", "45:19", "that's how you develop new techniques", "45:21", "and that's there is a ego issue too like", "45:24", "with guys who are not that good at", "45:26", "jujitsu like you see it a lot like maybe", "45:28", "the but like strikers yes I don't want a", "45:30", "role because it only can tapped that is", "45:32", "stupid that's it it doesn't mean", "45:34", "anything you tap it doesn't mean you're", "45:35", "not as good as the other guy just mean", "45:36", "you play that game and you just get cut", "45:39", "and end of it so what you know so what I", "45:41", "got tap all the time I

we don't hurt each other", "46:12", "jiu-jitsu you can allow to go further", "46:15", "without hurting children in kickboxing", "46:17", "for example where it striking it can be", "46:19", "brain damage yeah that's the hardest is", "46:21", "it or I should ask you is that the", "46:23", "hardest place to find guys that you're", "46:26", "comfortable training with is in striking", "46:27", "so
