you're", "09:13", "a cop and you're a fight for your life", "09:15", "and", "09:15", "you can't use chokeholds that's", "09:19", "fucking crazy you're gonna get shot and", "09:21", "killed or somebody else is going to get", "09:23", "shot and killed someone's going to take", "09:24", "your gun", "09:24", "yeah and and the the idea of defund the", "09:26", "police and i i", "09:28", "i understand the premise okay and this", "09:30", "is once again", "09:31", "where many people that say defund the", "09:34", "police they don't mean hey just", "09:36", "get rid of police of course there's a", "09:38", "there's a fraction of people that are", "09:39", "saying defund the police means we don't", "09:40", "want any more police anymore", "09:42", "there's a portion of people saying that",

money for training", "10:00", "and the way the police departments are", "10:03", "set up", "10:04", "they do the most ridiculously", "10:07", "minuscule amount of training for what", "10:10", "their job is so", "10:11", "as you know i was in the seal teams we", "10:12", "would train for 18 months", "10:15", "18 months we were trained to go on a", "10:17", "six-month deployment", "10:19", "cops

you're gonna work with", "10:53", "simunition you're gonna do de-escalation", "10:56", "drills", "10:57", "because it's really hard i mean being a", "10:59", "cop is i think is the hardest job in the", "11:01", "world and by the way they're not gonna", "11:02", "have to worry about defunding the police", "11:03", "because", "11:04", "no one's gonna wanna be a cop anymore", "11:06", "who is

"11:15", "of the country", "11:16", "i want to be viewed as someone that's uh", "11:19", "that kills innocent people", "11:20", "the the the recruiting in cop for for", "11:23", "police is going to go down", "11:24", "so hard it's going to be ridiculous it's", "11:26", "going to be ridiculous and then who are", "11:27", "you getting there", "11:28", "you're going to get people that are", "11:30", "worse level people", "11:32", "worst level humans are going to show up", "11:33", "to be cops so", "11:35", "the training piece though", "11:39", "they should do very very scenario driven", "11:42",

"11:49", "they appear to be compliant you ask you", "11:53", "you learn how to talk to them", "11:54", "you very quickly learn that instead of", "11:56", "yelling them out of the out of the gate",

rid of all of them did you ever", "38:14", "see cocaine cowboys", "38:16", "no great documentary but one of the", "38:18", "things it talks about is the corruption", "38:20", "during the cocaine era

happen really yep and what causes", "38:55", "something like that usually", "38:56", "they're well the the problem is bad", "38:58", "leadership it's always bad leadership", "39:00", "because you can take a bunch of", "39:02", "knuckleheads and you give them a good", "39:03", "leader", "39:04", "and they'll do they'll do fine so it's", "39:07", "always comes down to the leadership", "39:09", "so

just", "39:25", "like a bad platoon and they say you know", "39:27", "what you guys are done", "39:29", "it seems incredibly difficult to be a", "39:32", "good leader", "39:32", "one of the one of the

about you're", "40:32", "running scenarios you're putting people", "40:34", "in bad situations you're using", "40:35", "simunition you're doing all these things", "40:37", "so i got to see over and

different things wash out how they", "40:49", "wash out and what's interesting is", "40:51", "and what i really realized when i was in", "40:54", "that position", "40:55", "is that their leadership is a", "40:58", "skill and you can get better at it now", "41:01", "just like fighting just like jiu jitsu", "41:04", "there's certain people that have a", "41:07", "natural propensity to be good at you got", "41:09", "some let's say someone's really strong", "41:10", "right they're gonna have an advantage", "41:12", "let's say someone's super flexible", "41:13", "they're gonna have a little advantage", "41:14", "let's say someone has uh they're big", "41:17", "right these things are advantages in", "41:18", "fighting", "41:19", "in leadership it's the same thing let's", "41:20", "say someone is super articulate", "41:23", "that's helpful let's say someone doesn't", "41:26", "have a bad temper", "41:27", "that's very helpful but everyone is at a", "41:29", "different level well just like you can", "41:30", "take a bunch of different", "41:32", "sized and shaped and athletic ability", "41:34", "people and you can make them better at", "41:36", "fighting", "41:37", "you can take a bunch of people with", "41:38", "different levels of", "41:40", "leadership characteristics and you can", "41:42", "improve them", "41:43", "and then there are actual moves", "41:46", "there's actual moves that you can do as", "41:49", "a leader", "41:50", "that are just like a jiu jitsu move oh", "41:52", "joe comes to me and he's yelling and", "41:53", "screaming at me that", "41:55", "he didn't get the he didn't i didn't", "41:56", "give him two extra people to go on his", "41:58", "job", "41:59", "instead of me going hey joe shut up you", "42:01", "don't know what you're talking about", "42:02", "instead i actually listen to you", "42:03", "right i listen you say well hold on i", "42:05", "didn't know you needed that many people", "42:07", "what do you what do you need them for", "42:08", "so i show a little sense of urgency i", "42:10", "kind of reflect what your", "42:11", "emotions are so i'm not just", "42:14", "creating a fight between you and me", "42:16", "because if you and i are fighting", "42:18", "you and i are not finding a solution so", "42:20", "i'm going to reflect a little bit of", "42:22", "your emotion and then i'm going to", "42:23", "diminish it a little bit so you and i", "42:24", "can have a real conversation", "42:26", "so there's moves that you can do", "42:30", "a leader that function like a jiu jitsu", "42:32", "move", "42:33", "and they're very very powerful and the", "42:34", "more of them you learn the better off", "42:36", "you'll be", "42:37", "and you need to practice them you won't", "42:39", "be good at them", "42:40", "out of the gate it's going to take some", "42:42", "just like if i showed you an armlock and", "42:43", "you've never done jiu jitsu before", "42:44", "you're not going to be able to get on", "42:45", "the mat and do to somebody you're going", "42:46", "to have to try it a couple times you", "42:48", "have to learn the little", "42:49", "nuances to the move so there are ways", "42:51",

even those people can improve", "43:02", "so your question of out of a thousand", "43:04", "people how many", "43:05", "really good leaders there are well you", "43:07", "have to ask okay you", "43:09", "just talk about how many people are just", "43:10", "naturally born great leaders", "43:13", "you're probably your suspicion is", "43:14", "correct it's not a huge amount", "43:16", "but how many of those leaders can you", "43:18", "improve exponentially", "43:20", "in their ability to lead and that's what", "43:23", "you don't have a company on front that's", "43:24", "what we do", "43:25", "all the time is we go and work with", "43:26", "companies we work with leaders", "43:28", "that is exactly what we do and we take", "43:32", "companies of i mean we work with", "43:33",

where", "43:41", "the", "43:42", "where the leadership is and what they're", "43:44", "thinking and", "43:45", "so you can become a much much better", "43:48", "leader", "43:48", "over time now how

"you'd go in you'd have a fighter that's", "111:45", "whatever level at", "111:47", "let's say let's say jiu jitsu because", "111:48", "i'm trying to jiu-jitsu with them and", "111:50", "every day you know they're they they", "111:52", "feel a certain level", "111:53", "and then one day you come in and you", "111:54", "train with them and they're just they", "111:56", "just suck", "111:57", "and i would tell them it's like hey man", "111:58", "two days off go eat some steak because", "112:00", "you would know", "112:00", "100 percent that they're over trained", "112:02", "yeah 100 what do you

"112:33", "train fighters anymore like i used to", "112:34", "just because i don't have time anymore", "112:36", "but you would you would work so hard", "112:40", "to make sure that on that night", "112:44", "that they're there yeah they're there", "112:46", "and some people", "112:47", "get in the cage and they do better than", "112:49", "they would normally do", "112:50", "some people get in the cage and they", "112:52", "don't do as good and you got you know", "112:54", "jeremy stephens a great example", "112:55", "because especially when he first came", "112:58", "out started training",

got in the cage he would just", "113:09", "elevate man", "113:10", "like mentally psychologically elevate", "113:14", "and he would perform way better in the", "113:16", "cage and then i've had other fighters", "113:18", "that", "113:18", "you'd get like they would be kicking", "113:21", "people's asses", "113:22", "in training and then they get in the", "113:23", "cage and it's a down step", "113:25", "and it's so hard to see that so hard", "113:28", "it's because", "113:28", "sometimes those guys are very committed", "113:30", "and they're working hard and", "113:32", "they're doing great and they just get in", "113:34", "there and just it's a psychological", "113:36", "thing", "113:37", "you know some people are dwarfed by the", "113:38", "moment it's very interesting to see",

"115:06", "know anything and it's real real obvious", "115:08", "but when you get at a high level of muay", "115:11", "thai", "115:12", "it's very similar maybe not quite as", "115:15", "similar because there's always this idea", "115:16", "that well", "115:17", "you know i at least know if i throw up i", "115:18", "at least know as a human", "115:20", "how to throw a punch at least there's",

throw a punch so there is like", "115:32", "a puncher's chance", "115:33", "but i remember the first time i sparred", "115:34", "with a real muay thai guy", "115:36", "i was i felt like a white belt i was", "115:38", "like oh okay", "115:39", "because i would think about throwing a", "115:41", "kick and i would get you know", "115:43", "kicked myself i would think about it and", "115:46", "get kicked", "115:46", "oh he knows exactly what i'm gonna do", "115:48", "just like a white belt jiu jitsu", "115:49", "you know you you can predict everything", "115:51", "that they're gonna do there he

point is", "163:41", "leg locks are a part of the game", "163:44", "and there was a time period where people", "163:46", "thought that leglocks would", "163:48", "change the game completely and at a",

that's", "163:58", "why you see guys like tonan right", "164:00", "he doesn't always win with heel hooks", "164:04", "but you have to address them or you will", "164:06", "lose", "164:07", "right and

"164:17", "development which i was at kind of", "164:20", "ground zero with dean lister", "164:21", "and the crazy thing is dean lister", "164:26", "he has like a like a crazy savant mind", "164:29", "where", "164:30", "i would create one thing", "164:35", "for every whatever", "164:38", "for every 20 things that dean created", "164:41", "it's probably like eddie and i don't", "164:42", "know eddie as well as you do but", "164:45", "just the creative part of his brain is", "164:48", "what the most powerful thing was yeah", "164:49", "and then once people", "164:50", "saw it they're like okay now we can", "164:52", "build upon this yeah for eddie it's 100", "164:54", "the creative part of his brain also the", "164:56", "fact that when i met eddie", "164:57", "he hated lifting weights he wouldn't", "164:59", "lift weights because i would try to get", "165:01", "him to lift weights like come on let's", "165:02", "look forward to", "165:02", "i'm fucking lifting shit like you can go", "165:04", "lift weights so so he was this little", "165:06", "tiny guy", "165:07", "and he had to rely on technique so he", "165:09", "had to rely on trickery", "165:11", "plus he was a musician

also this guy that doesn't like", "165:20", "people telling him that he's wrong", "165:22", "so like you know like you can't do it", "165:24", "that way he's like oh really hm", "165:26", "let's see if i can and then he would", "165:27", "find a way to do it and you know and", "165:30", "he just developed all these like weird", "165:33", "entries into things and these weird", "165:35", "setups that people didn't see coming", "165:37", "and once he sort of improved upon these", "165:40", "and then started expanding upon them and", "165:42", "then developing that whole 10th planet", "165:44", "system i mean", "165:45", "really it's insanely creative system", "165:48", "that's just developed", "165:49", "based on his ability to just think", "165:52", "outside the box", "165:54", "i had jeff

thing that gets everybody is", "168:25", "the goddamn neck the net you know", "168:27", "because very few guys really strengthen", "168:29", "their neck correctly either", "168:30", "i think the neck is one thing that you", "168:32", "absolutely should strengthen", "168:34", "i think you can get away with not", "168:35", "lifting weights and doing jiu jitsu but", "168:37", "i don't think you can get away with not", "168:38", "strengthening your neck for very long", "168:41", "yeah that's uh it's one of those things", "168:44", "and it connects you to the rest of your", "168:46", "freaking body you also", "168:47", "use it you use it more than you think", "168:50", "you know especially me i was uh", "168:52", "my my favorite technique is probably", "168:54", "head and arm choke", "168:56", "and you're using your neck to secure", "168:58", "that arm and once you develop a feel", "169:00", "for holding an arm in place with that", "169:02", "neck then that gets a workout band",
