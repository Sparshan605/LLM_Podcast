lots be my eye I don't have I don't", "30:16", "have a number there but I can tell you", "30:19", "that that prices would you know food", "30:23", "prices might go up to what they were 30", "30:26",

there's no", "32:25", "augers there's no whatever spinning fans", "32:30", "vent shafts you know there's none of", "32:32", "this and so so part of the cost the", "32:36", "reason that our chicken is more", "32:37", "expensive than what's in the store is", "32:39", "not only externalize cost but it is it", "32:42", "is unrecognized unrecognized savings", "32:49", "that we offer that can't be

is", "33:04", "that worth Yeah right that's interesting", "33:06", "that we're not really taking into", "33:08", "consideration these secondary costs that", "33:10", "come about from doing it the wrong way", "33:12", "yeah we're not we're not I mean there's", "33:14", "there's a lot of those you you can much", "33:20", "much of our increased cost has nothing", "33:23", "to do with actual

won't get it but then you'd you", "68:39", "know I'd have days where half the day", "68:41", "I'd think this is all bullshit but we", "68:43", "need to do is tell people how to", "68:44", "strength

time", "71:35", "but you know my my thing is that look I", "71:40", "don't want I don't want a bunch of", "71:41", "people to die but but the fact is that", "71:44", "that death is is transformative and I", "71:47", "don't get all too mystical and spiritual", "71:50", "but whatever your your spiritual", "71:52", "tradition is mine happens to be", "71:55", "judeo-christian ethics so I think there", "71:57", "is an afterlife but but but even even if", "72:02", "even if there's nothing even if you say", "72:04", "well I'm dead and there's no spirit and", "72:05", "I'm gone even so that

speaks to what you", "73:05", "were talking about earlier that they", "73:06", "look at death as some sort of a failure", "73:08", "instead of just a part of the natural", "73:10", "cycle I was reading about one of the you", "73:13", "know they try to find new ways that the", "73:15", "coronavirus looks terrible and", "73:16", "and articles and one thing they were", "73:19", "saying was it takes between two and ten", "73:22", "years off the life of life expectancy of", "73:25", "the average person who gets it I'm like", "73:28", "okay well how did you come to that", "73:29", "conclusion well I came to that", "73:32", "conclusion because they looked at old", "73:34", "people who got it that might have", "73:35", "possibly lived you know seven eight", "73:38", "years five years more and they just", "73:41", "started doing these random calculations", "73:43", "based on how old people normally died", "73:45", "but then the problem with that is if you", "73:48", "look at the overall numbers the average", "73:50", "age that people die from coronavirus is", "73:52", "actually older than the average age", "73:54", "people die which is like well what are", "73:57", "you saying that okay it's taking years", "74:00", "off some people's lives but everything", "74:02", "does if you fall down it takes years off", "74:05", "your life if you're old right you die", "74:07", "from falling that fall should we stop", "74:09", "all falling if you get sick you need too", "74:12", "much sugar yes well that's a big one", "74:15", "right and that's one that's killing", "74:17", "people at almost the same numbers as the", "74:19", "coronavirus was at the peak I remember", "74:21", "there was like a grab the chrono virus", "74:23", "has passed heart attacks but wait a", "74:25", "minute how many goddamn heart attacks", "74:27", "are there something we could do about", "74:28", "heart attacks forget about that now this", "74:30", "is a pandemic yeah I mean cigarettes no", "74:34", "one even touched with a ten-foot pole", "74:35", "cuz cigarettes is killing people at four", "74:37", "and five times the rate coronavirus was", "74:40", "and no one was saying anything of it", "74:41", "because it's an elective thing you're", "74:43", "allowed to do it it's a freedom people", "74:44", "enjoy it you're grown adults here let's", "74:47", "stay home stay home and wear eye masks", "74:49", "and don't touch anything and stay home", "74:51", "and you're gonna lose your job but stay", "74:52", "home because you're not really grown", "74:54", "adult you're growing", "74:55", "I'll let you smoke cigarettes at home", "74:57", "how about that you feel better yeah well", "75:00", "I think I think I think a couple things", "75:03", "one is that you know our country has", "75:06", "never told people when we talk about you", "75:08", "know personal self-worth and your own", "75:10", "personal affirmation in a climate of", "75:14", "fear and worry the worst thing you can", "75:17", "do is tell lots of people you're not", "75:20", "important you're not essential yeah you", "75:24", "know what you've been doing all your", "75:25", "life what you do every day now it's it's", "75:28", "not as", "75:29", "what a faster way to whatever D affirm", "75:33", "you know a person then to tell them", "75:36", "you're not essential I mean I just think", "75:38", "it's horrible and and now we have the", "75:40", "data and again yeah these data points", "75:42", "and we've all become I think through", "75:44", "this more wary of statisticians yeah but", "75:49", "but one that I just saw again this week", "75:51", "was that every every % increase in", "75:54", "unemployment equals 30,000 deaths in our", "75:57", "country annually every 1% unemployment", "76:00", "equal to aside depression you know", "76:03", "whatever that's a really important", "76:05", "statistic it is what so so so we've gone", "76:08", "now from you know that that white-hot", "76:10", "three and a half percent unemployment to", "76:13", "now what eighteen and a half that's", "76:14", "fifteen fifteen percent I'm frankly I'm", "76:18", "frankly actually amazed that we're at", "76:20", "only eighteen percent right now but I", "76:23", "think that's only because a lot of", "76:24", "people have been furloughed and are not", "76:26", "unemployed so so you know if all those", "76:31", "people go back to work that have been", "76:32", "furloughed your restaurants and things", "76:34", "like that", "76:35", "it'll be okay but anyway we've we've", "76:37", "increased in the last sixty days fifteen", "76:40", "percent in unemployment if that thirty", "76:42", "thousand figure is actually correct", "76:45", "that's an additional four hundred fifty", "76:47", "thousand

like we were you're talking about", "77:08", "the cost of food but and then look at", "77:10", "the cost of health care and when the", "77:12", "cost of food is higher and food is", "77:14", "higher quality look at that the cost of", "77:16", "health where it drops in an equal number", "77:17", "right and I think this is this is along", "77:20", "those lines with we're looking at deaths", "77:22", "through the coronavirus but we're saying", "77:26", "oh you're putting dollars over lives", "77:28", "you're saying the economy is more", "77:31", "important than people's lives no we're", "77:33", "saying you need a nuanced perspective", "77:35", "because if you ignore the economy it", "77:37", "actually cost lives and it costs a", "77:40", "staggering number of life", "77:41", "and in
