hear it well I think that there", "126:07", "might be other ways to deal with that", "126:09", "because we're hunting I think it's super", "126:12", "reasonable to be able to have something",

"127:14", "because you learn more about the animal", "127:16", "yeah it's more intense - it's um it's", "127:19", "also it requires more skill I feel like", "127:21", "these sounds fucked up but I feel like", "127:23", "the animal has more of a chance like if", "127:26", "if I'm inside you know 60 yards shooting", "127:29", "an enamel that animal has way more", "127:31", "chance to get the fuck away from me", "127:33", "way more chance for me to blow it to", "127:36", "step on a twig or it to catch my wind or", "127:39", "it makes it more difficult yeah and it's", "127:42", "just archery is it's there's nothing", "127:47", "this set like rifles for sure are the", "127:50", "best way to gather meat for sure no", "127:52", "doubt about it", "127:53", "boom one shot there down you know you", "127:55", "hit him in the breadbasket boom it's", "127:58", "over", "127:58", "but archery requires way more discipline", "128:02", "in there's so many ways it can fuck up", "128:04", "there's so many ways it can go wrong and", "128:08", "but there's that requirement that you", "128:11", "have of yourself to practice and to be", "128:15", "to be able to execute like when the the", "128:19", "time is now it's it's hard it's very", "128:21", "very difficult to do yeah and because of", "128:23", "that it's like that from my brain that I", "128:26", "find that very appealing I'm very I",

and elk and moose all the time with", "128:40", "a rifle you know if you make a bad shot", "128:42", "and people make bad and I've made bad", "128:44", "shots people make bad shots it's like", "128:46", "you it's bad no matter what but with a", "128:49", "bow and arrow you'd be amazed how lethal", "128:52", "it is oh I'm not surprised because you", "128:54", "get that big broad cutting edge going", "128:56", "right through their lungs I mean they", "128:57", "hammer it's quick they die quick I mean", "128:59", "I shot an elk at to hone ranch last year", "129:02", "and it was down in four

is", "131:00", "they discriminate against all sorts of", "131:03", "people anybody that's not they're making", "131:05", "the rule I guess weird a lot of dog", "131:08", "owners around that day but no I mean", "131:11", "think about it every every rule we make", "131:13", "it's just a game now this the technology", "131:16", "exists if you wanted to use a guided", "131:18", "missile you'd kill the every animal", "131:20", "right yeah so you gotta you gotta have", "131:22", "limits on the technology for you you", "131:24", "personally prefer to use a bow and arrow", "131:26", "for me I use a

"131:42", "people that could afford to go home with", "131:43", "a helicopter therefore they didn't have", "131:45", "much power in making the regulations and", "131:48", "so when you say hunt with a

the idea is to", "132:00", "make it more difficult for them to get", "132:02", "to play someplace like the Chugach or", "132:04", "something like that some some places", "132:06", "difficult to get to the mountains the", "132:10", "idea is the people that don't want to", "132:14", "use helicopters are the ones you get to", "132:16", "vote don't want people to use", "132:19", "helicopters I understand I mean I'm not", "132:22", "saying I want people to bill use", "132:23", "helicopters I'm just saying maybe if a", "132:26", "lot of people wanted to use helicopters", "132:27", "to hunt you know cuz they know you're", "132:30", "you've got a certain number of animals", "132:32", "that can be taken and maintain the", "132:34", "population right so the technology to", "132:36", "take

"132:48", "population but now it's all got to be", "132:51", "regulated so it's like some people want", "132:54", "to hunt on foot maybe they would prefer", "132:56", "that you couldn't use an airplane", "132:58", "because the people that are flying with", "133:00", "airplanes are they going to be competing", "133:02", "against this person on foot yeah", "133:04", "but the way it all balances out a lot of", "133:07", "people like to use fixed-wing airplanes", "133:08", "they're relatively economical so you can", "133:10", "use that you cannot use a helicopter in", "133:12",

are getting", "133:32", "so thick I don't even keep up on every", "133:35", "detail that doesn't apply to me but I", "133:37", "believe that now there's some", "133:40", "regulations you can't you can't even", "133:41", "scout out of a fixed-wing airplane at", "133:43", "least in in certain situations if I know", "133:45", "there's places like that in the United", "133:47", "States or in the

is something you can use", "160:10", "by yourself you can use this technique", "160:11", "of using your voice to confuse caribou", "160:14", "and herd them where you want them to go", "160:15", "you echo out on the lake if their", "160:20", "caribou it's wide open they can see me", "160:23", "half a mile away and they'll go out in", "160:25", "the middle of the lake in the day and", "160:26",

"160:37", "island or shoreline depending on where I", "160:39", "am and it'll bounce back and they'll", "160:41", "stop and they'll run straight back at me", "160:43", "wow I've had him come running by me", "160:45", "where trisha was like oh my god she", "160:47", "thought I was gonna get run over she was", "160:48", "filming once and I could hear when I", "160:50", "watched the video and she's like I think", "160:52", "he's gonna get run over you know she's", "160:53", "like really would you see that picture", "160:56", "there Jane it's it's right on the yeah", "161:02", "scroll up the top right there the upper", "161:03", "leftmost picture yeah okay Trisha took", "161:08", "that picture Wow", "161:10", "so now those caribou those caribou they", "161:14", "were running away from me before this", "161:16", "picture was taken and I screaming and", "161:19", "hollering echoing my voice off the", "161:21", "shoreline and they turn around and run", "161:23", "back and I do many times I had these", "161:26", "caribou run back and forth like five six", "161:28", "times I could stay within fifty yards of", "161:30", "them a lot of times just by yelling as", "161:32", "loud as I could you look really close", "161:34", "right there", "161:34", "yeah well Trisha thought I was gonna get", "161:37", "you know trampled and so this is how you", "161:39", "hunted them this is a technique I've", "161:42", "used for hunting but on this particular", "161:43", "day I was just demonstrating it now did", "161:48", "you run into any issues where you really", "161:50", "didn't have any

is", "162:32", "maybe isn't but that wasn't my", "162:33", "motivation what I yield how would I when", "162:35", "you had a good amount of it what I felt", "162:37", "was that if I ate too much meat it had", "162:43", "bad effects what kind of bad I believe I", "162:46", "believe my body started to feel weird I", "162:48", "believe that you can only handle so much", "162:50", "protein but you can handle a lot of fat", "162:52", "what I found is I had to eat most of my", "162:54", "calories from fat I would eat a half a", "162:56", "pound of solid pure fat a day when I was", "162:59", "eating just meat and fat I might eat two", "163:02", "or three even four pounds of meat a day", "163:05", "but but like a half a pound of it was", "163:07", "pure fat and weight but it was the form",

right", "163:17", "because it's a different caribou fun", "163:19", "chewy fat like a deer fat so it's", "163:22", "actually but you know I'm saying it's", "163:24", "like it's not like like it doesn't", "163:26", "render down like beef fat wood moose fat", "163:31", "yeah oh sure", "163:33", "does render you can render it if you", "163:34", "want I rendered along it's a different", "163:36", "like the way you look at it on the", "163:38", "animal it just seems different what's", "163:40", "different about it is that those game", "163:43", "animals do not put on fat within the", "163:47", "muscle right it's separate right if you", "163:50", "get a fat moose he'll have a big fat", "163:52", "layer on his back and so you would", "163:54", "render that fat or that's how you do I", "163:56", "mean I'll eat it all the way when I'm", "163:58", "butchering the moose in the field I", "163:59", "start eating the fat right there", "164:00", "really sure Wow grab it off the kidneys", "164:03", "and stuff and start eating it so that", "164:04", "was the key for you was to get enough", "164:05", "fat I had to eat a lot of fat", "164:07", "and then I would feel better if if", "164:11", "you're just eating protein for me it", "164:13", "didn't work like what what how did it", "164:15", "make you feel it made me feel like I had", "164:16", "drink an awful lot of water
