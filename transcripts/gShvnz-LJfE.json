so I was like wow this is", "03:02", "stunning yeah you know for me the net", "03:05", "neutrality thing is huge because when I", "03:07", "was in law school I read this one book", "03:09", "called fighting for air and it", "03:11", "documented like the Telecommunications", "03:13", "Act in 97 it's like boring stuff right", "03:15", "don't go read the Telecommunications Act", "03:17", "in 97 but like radio mattered to me more", "03:20", "like growing up with the radio like I", "03:21", "remember they would actually break", "03:24", "records on the radio back in the day", "03:25", "like Funplex still does it on hot 97", "03:27", "he'll break records he broke my boy old", "03:29", "Drew's record the other day but like", "03:32", "recently it's like Clear Channel I Heart", "03:35", "Radio they own all the radio stations", "03:36", "and it really sterilized content and", "03:39", "they play the same songs every hour in", "03:42", "every city almost around the world and I", "03:45", "when I read that book and I went to law", "03:47", "school I realized I was like yo is", "03:49", "because of the deregulation of radio", "03:54", "that allowed for all these local",

like", "04:07", "this happens to every single industry we", "04:09", "have whether it's radio television but", "04:11", "now it's coming for the internet and by", "04:13", "deregulating it you're gonna gut it", "04:15", "again and you know like when technology", "04:18", "started popping in podcast came around I", "04:20", "mean that's what enabled JRE and that's", "04:23", "why my first place to go is like imma", "04:24", "come see Joe", "04:26", "because you were one of the innovators", "04:29", "with this new technology well thanks but", "04:34", "I think what people are super concerned", "04:37", "about is things getting blocked right", "04:40", "that's that's like one of the first ones", "04:41", "yes is that something that we", "04:43", "legitimately have to worry about this is", "04:46", "a good question here's what I know right", "04:49", "now your broadband provider has the", "04:52", "technical ability to block content and", "04:55", "websites it's got the business incentive", "04:57", "to block or slow access to some websites", "05:01", "if they don't have a special commercial", "05:02", "relationship with them so now the FCC", "05:05", "just gave them the legal green right", "05:07", "just go ahead and so I feel overtime", "05:11", "this is something we need to be", "05:13", "concerned about and so this open", "05:14", "platform that was full of in deven", "05:16", "independent voices now you've got this", "05:19", "new gatekeeper your broadband provider", "05:22", "they've got a lot more power than went", "05:24", "they used to how close was the vote it", "05:27", "was three two and what's the argument", "05:31", "for this well that's that's fair um I", "05:34", "think there's an argument that you want", "05:37", "government out of the way deregulation", "05:39", "is going to lead to more competition and", "05:41", "we'll have a flourishing of new ideas", "05:45", "and content if we just move government", "05:47", "out of the way and even if you're", "05:49", "sympathetic to that argument here's", "05:51", "where I think it breaks down according", "05:54", "to the FCC's own data half of the", "05:56", "households in this country don't have a", "05:58", "choice of broadband provider I'm", "06:00", "familiar with this I'm one of them only", "06:02", "have one provider that serves my house", "06:03", "so the thing is if your broadband", "06:05", "provider started blocking your content", "06:08", "or throttling your access to some video", "06:10", "in a competitive market you'd pick up", "06:12", "you take your business somewhere else", "06:14", "but about half of our households don't", "06:16", "even have that opportunity so to me the", "06:20", "idea that the competitive market will", "06:22", "prevent this behavior just doesn't fly", "06:25", "yeah that doesn't seem to make sense and", "06:27", "that that's an issue in my neighborhood", "06:29", "as well and a lot of other people I know", "06:30", "as well I mean I think they make deals", "06:32", "where only one company whether it's", "06:35", "Verizon or whatever has an area yeah", "06:38", "they monopolize the area's the", "06:39", "limit the opportunities and choices and", "06:41", "when they say deregulation it just any", "06:44", "time they deregulate things and say hey", "06:46", "we're gonna leave it to the market and", "06:48", "have competition I think it's impossible", "06:50", "to have that when you have a country", "06:51", "with such an inequality an income", "06:53", "inequality gap right that's the problem", "06:56", "is that all right let's all go compete", "06:57", "Joe you're not gonna start a Verizon I'm", "06:59", "not gonna start a Verizon right you know", "07:00", "I mean like we can't compete with these", "07:02", "dudes and even Comcast can't even", "07:04", "compete with Verizon like you know these", "07:07", "dudes are all getting smashed so there", "07:09", "is not actual competition I think", "07:11", "deregulation works when you have", "07:12", "multiple players and options and that", "07:15", "the market actually can come into play", "07:16", "but with the economy so top-heavy right", "07:19", "now I don't think there is a possibility", "07:22", "of competition yeah I mean listen", "07:23", "competition is the best regulator we", "07:25", "know right we want there to be these", "07:27", "markets where consumers have lots and", "07:29", "lots of choices but if competition is an", "07:32", "existing you need a little oversight to", "07:34", "make sure that every consumer gets a", "07:36", "fair shot well it seems like that's", "07:37", "where the real argument lies that if", "07:39", "there are monopolies and there seem to", "07:40", "be in certain areas with in regards to", "07:44", "what kind of Internet access you can get", "07:46", "that if you don't have regulation then", "07:49", "then what is going to protect the", "07:50", "consumer what is going to protect free", "07:52", "speech what's going to protect say if", "07:54", "you are on Verizon and your system is on", "07:57", "Verizon what if you decide to make a", "07:59", "podcast that criticizes Verizon and", "08:01", "everybody says you know hey Eddie Wong's", "08:03", "got a podcast criticizing us I want to", "08:05", "shut that down and they can just I would", "08:07", "have been shut down a long time ago", "08:08", "yeah yeah we're not saying that they", "08:12", "would do that but they could yeah", "08:14", "and that's what's scary that's that's", "08:16", "not good and you know so much of our", "08:17", "speech these days it doesn't take place", "08:19", "in public places it takes place on these", "08:22", "private platforms right so they have a", "08:24", "lot of power and we have to think about", "08:27", "that as a country and a democracy how", "08:29", "much openness do we want and then how do", "08:32", "we create a framework in Washington that", "08:35", "supports that openness and that's really", "08:36", "to me what net neutrality was about the", "08:38", "other question I have is right let's say", "08:41", "you know for let's say a service", "08:45", "provider buys Hulu right or or they buy", "08:49", "or they create their own streaming", "08:51", "platform called like Zulu", "08:53", "right so they start Sulu they could", "08:55", "start to charge Netflix more money for", "08:59", "using their service they could charge", "09:02", "who more money they could charge you", "09:04", "know beats more money or whatever so", "09:06", "that they have an advantage for their", "09:08", "own streaming services and in that way", "09:10", "they can culturally control content and", "09:14", "you know you're so right and what", "09:16", "happens is you as a consumer you just", "09:17", "get online and you might not even notice", "09:19", "right you might not even notice they're", "09:22", "taking you to the video content that", "09:24", "they have a special pay for relationship", "09:26", "with I think though the biggest harm is", "09:29", "to entrepreneurship yes right now look", "09:32", "you have a good idea you got a business", "09:34", "a service you can go online and you can", "09:36", "almost instantly have global reach", "09:38", "that's amazing", "09:40", "but now you're gonna have to figure out", "09:42", "is your broadband provider instead gonna", "09:46", "shuffle off all your traffic to someone", "09:48", "else who's paying them on the side are", "09:51", "you gonna have a fair shot to show your", "09:53", "wares and your ideas to the world it's", "09:55", "harder because I start thinking like a", "09:57", "bad one percenter dude and I'm like", "09:59", "alright if there's no net neutrality and", "10:02", "I'm the only person that can service", "10:04", "Calabasas California Woodland Hills", "10:06", "California well I'm gonna charge all the", "10:09", "other streaming providers more money to", "10:11", "use this and I'm gonna create a", "10:13", "competitor and every single one of these", "10:15", "sectors so you can have an advantage if", "10:18", "you have your show with me and if you're", "10:20", "on the other one I'm gonna disadvantage", "10:21", "you I'm gonna tax you basically so right", "10:26", "now these are concerns and there's", "10:28", "nothing that's actually happening yet", "10:31", "this ruling was just passed that's right", "10:33", "are there any plans in place for things", "10:38", "that we should be concerned with and is", "10:40", "there anything that we can do about this", "10:43", "current ruling yes", "10:45", "there's loads because I'm not giving up", "10:47", "in the fight for net neutrality and I", "10:49", "don't want you to either", "10:50", "we got a few different pathways ahead", "10:53", "first in Congress right now they are", "10:57", "trying to get rid of what just happened", "11:00", "at the FCC they're trying to use this", "11:02", "law called the congressional review act", "11:04", "that in effect just", "11:06", "everything that the FCC just did so it's", "11:09", "a way to wipe out what just happened and", "11:12", "while the odds are long there's more", "11:14", "than 40 United States senators who have", "11:16", "sponsored that law and in the house side", "11:19", "there's more than 80 members of the", "11:22", "House of Representatives", "11:23", "so there's momentum growing in Congress", "11:25", "to take a look at this issue and maybe", "11:27", "fix what the FCC did and if you're", "11:30", "sitting out there and thinking they're", "11:31", "not listening to you we should do is", "11:33", "something totally old-fashioned you", "11:35", "should pick up the phone call your", "11:37", "members of Congress and your", "11:38", "representatives and let them know you", "11:39", "care about this issue because that still", "11:42", "today is one of the most powerful ways", "11:44", "of conveying your opinion to those who", "11:46", "represent you", "11:47", "when is the vote happening on that it is", "11:49", "not yet scheduled I think it's gonna", "11:51", "happen first in the United States Senate", "11:52", "mm-hmm and later in the house I also", "11:56", "think we are gonna have litigation we've", "12:00", "already got a few states attorneys", "12:02", "general who want to sue to overturn this", "12:04", "we've got some big companies some public", "12:05", "interest groups so I think it's fair to", "12:08", "say we're going to court and then we're", "12:11", "also seeing activity in state houses and", "12:13", "that we've seen net neutrality", "12:15", "legislation introduced in Nebraska", "12:18", "Nevada Washington State Massachusetts", "12:21", "California lots of places and I'm not", "12:25", "sure how that all comes together legally", "12:27", "but what you see is this momentum", "12:28", "growing that people are not happy with", "12:30", "what Washington just did the thing that", "12:32", "I'm worried about with the state's laws", "12:34", "right so just to lay it out for the", "12:36", "listeners right there's people will well", "12:38", "the government will pass the federal law", "12:40", "but then states have their own rights to", "12:42", "regulate certain things let's say we use", "12:44", "marijuana laws as an example because", "12:47", "recently a lot of states passed the", "12:49", "legal marijuana laws right but then", "12:51", "Trump gave people the power to enforce", "12:54", "federal laws about marijuana more", "12:57", "stringently right he was telling the", "12:59", "federal government hey enforce our", "13:01", "federal marijuana laws what's really", "13:04", "Jeff Sessions right yeah yeah his goon", "13:08", "is doing that but so how would fatter", "13:10", "ilysm work if states started to pass", "13:13", "their own net neutrality laws versus the", "13:16", "the FCC Commission", "13:18", "yeah those are hard questions I mean", "13:20", "they go right to the Constitution what's", "13:22", "interstate what's within the state's", "13:24", "authority but I'm just standing back and", "13:27", "seeing really just a lot of energy on", "13:29", "this issue there's nothing else that", "13:32", "I've worked on in Washington where this", "13:34", "immediately state houses decided to put", "13:37", "pen to paper and introduce legislation", "13:38", "and I think that that momentum is what's", "13:41", "really exciting here well I think", "13:43", "everyone understands the insane power of", "13:46", "the Internet and what what a cultural", "13:49", "shift that we've experienced over the", "13:52", "last twenty years I mean it's", "13:53", "unprecedented in human history there's", "13:55", "never been anything like it in terms of", "13:57", "access to information in terms of the", "13:59", "rate of change the way people look at", "14:01", "things the way the issues get discussed", "14:03", "this cycle of news which is like what", "14:05", "ten hours now stories come in and out I", "14:07", "mean Hawaii just had a fake missile", "14:11", "attack and everybody already forgot it's", "14:13", "already on to the next like what's the", "14:15", "next thing I posted I check my phone", "14:16", "because I think we have to fix that we", "14:18", "should certainly show what happened in", "14:20", "Hawaii someone went crazy", "14:22", "we're still learning it looks like it", "14:24", "was a state-level issue but you can't", "14:27", "have things like that happen we got to", "14:29", "figure out a way in this digital world", "14:31", "that we get accurate information to", "14:33", "people faster and we got to come up with", "14:36", "better systems than what we just saw you", "14:37", "need somebody pressed a button and sent", "14:39", "out a text that said that there's an", "14:41", "incoming ballistic missile a possibility", "14:44", "a threat of an incoming ballistic", "14:45", "missile this is not a drill and then I", "14:48", "have friends in Hawaii and everyone went", "14:50", "crazy people were crying in the streets", "14:51", "no one knew what to do and of course", "14:53", "this is a state that was attacked you", "14:55", "know less than a hundred years ago", "14:56", "during World War two so this is their", "14:59", "yeah it's not an unusual thing for them", "15:01", "yeah yeah I had the privilege of working", "15:02", "for Senator in a way from Hawaii years", "15:04", "ago and I think Hawaiians are you know", "15:07", "they're graceful they're resilient but", "15:09", "they live with the knowledge that they", "15:11", "are susceptible to some attack yeah so", "15:13", "this gave them 40 minutes they're worse", "15:16", "forty minutes of their life and the", "15:18", "amazing thing to me is it took like ten", "15:20", "minutes or so for this to be corrected", "15:22", "on Twitter", "15:22", "it took took up another half hour for", "15:26", "our official systems to update and say", "15:28", "in fact this was a mistake", "15:30", "yeah once we found out here that out", "15:32", "can't let that happen yeah but then once", "15:35", "I figured out it was a mistake I was", "15:36", "like whoa maybe I should ask Jessica if", "15:38", "we could send like a national message on", "15:41", "my birthday 12 a.m. March 1st and be", "15:43", "like you up just a nationwide booty call", "15:48", "FCC will not be helping I had to ask", "15:52", "that's a big question yeah no but what", "15:55", "Joe was saying about the internet and", "15:57", "how it opened things up like personally", "15:59", "for me", "15:59", "like today's Martin Luther King jr. Day", "16:01", "right and I remember reading letter from", "16:05", "Birmingham jail as a kid Jonathan Swift", "16:07", "Modest Proposal as a kid and Tupac me", "16:10", "against the world those were like the", "16:12", "three works that made me want to write", "16:14", "and I started writing since I was 15", "16:17", "years old never gave up but no one would", "16:19", "buy my writing right the only place that", "16:21", "will buy my writing was wrote a wire and", "16:23", "I would write fantasy sports updates for", "16:25", "them I covered the magic and I covered", "16:27", "the Knicks but all the way until I was", "16:29", "like 28 years old no one wanted to buy", "16:32", "my writing it was blogspot that allowed", "16:36", "me to write in my own voice and find my", "16:38", "own audience and then people started to", "16:41", "see whoa there are like weird children", "16:44", "on the internet that like Eddie's", "16:45", "writing like he's creating Elaine and I", "16:47", "talked to my publisher at Random House", "16:49", "and they're like yeah you created Elaine", "16:51", "selling books to people who don't buy", "16:52", "books non-traditional readers and so",

extraordinary thing", "17:23", "and it has no precedent in human culture", "17:27", "and with translation software now", "17:29", "languages no longer even a barrier I", "17:31", "mean it's changing

terrible", "30:07", "idea", "30:08", "like if you give people the option you", "30:10", "said hey do you think that five people", "30:12", "should be able to decide whether or not", "30:13", "the 320
