right and", "07:20", "that I think he knew that mm-hmm it is", "07:22", "letters it's really beautiful um and", "07:24", "heartbreaking and in his writing too I", "07:26", "mean I think that's what's been missed", "07:28", "about him is there's no romanticism in", "07:30", "self-destruction right towards the end", "07:32", "he definitely lost his productivity and", "07:34", "yawn Werner talked

times that are gonna", "07:52", "burn brightly and it's up to each writer", "07:55", "to decide how they like to burn next to", "07:57", "it and ya gonna burn brightly they may", "07:58", "not have other times and that's I think", "08:00", "an American thing where you can wager", "08:02", "that bright flame which means you may", "08:04", "have nothing left afterwards but", "08:05", "Thompson
