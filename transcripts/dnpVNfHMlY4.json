means", "00:32", "somewhere in the universe there is", "00:35", "another theof on that has done exactly", "00:38", "the same things that you've done said", "00:41", "exactly the same things that

definitely get", "06:39", "caught up in the minutia mm-hmm", "06:41", "I mean but what's out there in the world", "06:43", "in the universe I mean I think if", "06:46", "something were out there it would have", "06:48", "stopped by by now I don't know about", "06:50", "that it's been a lot of time it's a lot", "06:53", "of space a lot of space it has to go", "06:55", "through I think that things get so smart", "06:58", "that they don't do that anymore this is", "06:59", "what I think I think that this whole", "07:02", "idea about space travel mm-hmm I don't", "07:04", "think they do that after a while I think", "07:06", "they get so fucking smart they become", "07:07", "symbiotic with machines and I think", "07:10", "artificial life and artificial", "07:11", "intelligence they create their own", "07:13", "reality and literally create their own", "07:14", "universes I don't think they bother", "07:16", "traveling oh they're just thinking it up", "07:18", "and then there it is I think they make", "07:20", "things you know I think when I think", "07:23", "this is just the thought but I think", "07:25", "what's gonna happen with us I mean we", "07:26", "take little trips send a

but yeah we go out to", "07:38", "the moon we went to the moon a couple", "07:39", "times supposedly you know right but what", "07:41", "we don't do what you know what we're", "07:43", "doing with these little tiny trips it's", "07:45", "like all fairly close it's all inside of", "07:47", "our solar system right yeah", "07:48", "what we're saying is that someone is", "07:50", "going way way way further than that so", "07:52", "they would be have to be way more", "07:53", "advanced than that what I look at us and", "07:56", "I look at artificial life and artificial", "07:58", "intelligence and how close we are to", "08:00", "creating something that's smarter than", "08:01", "us", "08:01", "yeah within the next hundred years we're", "08:03", "gonna have some form of artificial life", "08:05", "that's probably way smarter than us and", "08:07", "it's gonna create even better versions", "08:10", "of artificial life it's gonna improve", "08:11", "upon the design and then there's gonna", "08:14", "be things that they can do in terms of", "08:17", "like recreating reality in your own mind", "08:19", "like sit you and I sitting across from", "08:22", "each other mm-hmm we're experienced in", "08:24", "this table we're experienced in looking", "08:27", "at each other we're friends we have a", "08:29", "history together we talk a lot so this", "08:31", "we when used to being in each other's", "08:34", "presence there's all these feelings and", "08:36", "thinking and thoughts going on I think", "08:38", "they're gonna be able to recreate that I", "08:39", "think they're gonna recreate that in a", "08:41", "way that's indistinguishable from this", "08:43", "moment that we're experiencing so then I", "08:46", "mean you are human just gonna become", "08:47", "obsolete then yeah", "08:49", "so okay well dang it dang it don't you", "08:54", "think we are I mean if you go back right", "08:56", "just isms yeah go back a second amoeba", "08:59", "or something the first time", "09:00", "single-celled organisms became", "09:02", "multi-celled organisms bugger and them", "09:04", "how many of them were hanging back no", "09:05", "man fuck that I'm gonna live in the", "09:07", "woods I'm gonna stage single cell single", "09:09", "cells way to go yeah the multi cell", "09:11", "stuff is bullshit I don't need to see", "09:13", "things man fuck you I don't need a phone", "09:15", "motherfucker yeah I'm a single-cell", "09:18", "organism", "09:22", "you know things I don't have to get any", "09:25", "better right like this I'm not gonna get", "09:27", "a job um be a hit man yeah if you looked", "09:30", "at single-celled organisms they", "09:31", "eventually became Theo von right that's", "09:34", "a that's a complicated leap from", "09:37", "single-celled organisms from billions of", "09:39", "years ago to Theo von holy-shit is not a", "09:41", "leap tell it to a human that's a big", "09:44", "leap so you're saying it would be crazy", "09:45", "for us if we didn't continue to be fully", "09:47", "we're going to that's a good point it's", "09:50", "gonna happen everything does we're gonna", "09:52", "improve upon this I mean we're different", "09:54", "now people are bigger and stronger and", "09:56", "faster than they were just a hundred", "09:57", "years ago because of nutrition you know", "09:59", "and those genes don't that was saying", "10:01", "that the genes of people who exercise", "10:03", "and are healthy they're better than the", "10:05", "genes of people that don't like you", "10:08", "literally can transfer some of those", "10:10", "traits and some of that potential into", "10:13", "children Rhonda Patrick got something", "10:14", "she tweeted about that a couple of days", "10:16", "ago I believe oh there's some mud rats", "10:18", "out there that have no genes almost I", "10:19", "feel like like mud rat humans yeah just", "10:22", "people that are just smoking their own", "10:25", "dicks out there no

evidence", "13:13", "that they have experimented with", "13:14", "spraying stuff in the sky and they", "13:15", "definitely seed clouds in certain parts", "13:17", "of the world and certain parts of the", "13:19", "country you know they can make it rain", "13:20", "like in its it's Abu Dhabi right where", "13:24", "they make it rain once a week Wow once a", "13:26", "week it's they live in the

the pilots", "13:39", "they spray into the clouds and somehow", "13:41", "or another it makes it rain you know", "13:45", "when a DK when I was talking about that", "13:46", "with that he one thing I was thinking", "13:47", "about was do you think that there are", "13:50", "aliens oh do you think that robots will", "13:53", "get so advanced that they will like", "13:58", "become aware and what

"could see him doing that dr.

"been flying across America for you know", "15:46", "40 50 years now right like yeah even", "15:49", "more maybe you know and it seems like", "15:52", "it's we could figure out how to get into", "15:55", "space it's harder than that for sure", "15:58", "first of all it's two hundred sixty two", "16:00", "thousand miles you know the earth is", "16:02", "24,000 miles around so a full trip from", "16:05", "right here so you start in Calabasas", "16:08", "okay you do a full trip all the way", "16:10", "around the planet and landing Calabasas", "16:12", "that's 24,000 miles okay so it's like", "16:16", "twelve times that or something yeah", "16:18", "something like that", "16:19", "well we could do that it's hard man and", "16:31", "not only that there's no air it's 1/6", "16:34",
