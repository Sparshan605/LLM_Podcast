this other world where", "07:54", "anyone can insert themselves into the", "07:57", "conversation they can actually mention", "07:59", "you and you'll see that without asking", "08:01", "for it", "08:02", "you can insert yourself into hashtags", "08:05", "and to search and these are areas that", "08:11", "people have taken advantage of and these", "08:14", "are the areas that people have gamed

possible", "08:27", "before now when this is all happening", "08:31", "what's the conversation like at Twitter", "08:33", "when you're recognizing that this is", "08:35", "happening that people are kind of gaming", "08:36", "the system like what it how do you guys", "08:39", "how do you mitigate it what's the", "08:41", "discussion well early on it was um it", "08:44", "was pretty surface level like how do we", "08:47", "change some of the app dynamics but more", "08:51", "recently", "08:53", "we're trying to go a lot deeper and", "08:54", "asking ourselves the question when", "08:56",

"something that we're saying without", "09:08", "being as clear about it so what does the", "09:13", "like button incentivize what does the", "09:15", "retweet incentivize what does the number", "09:18", "of followers and making that number big", "09:21", "and bold incentivize so I'm not sure", "09:26", "what we shouldn't I'm not sure if we", "09:29", "should incentivize anything but we need", "09:31", "to understand what that is and I think", "09:33", "you know right now we we do incentivize", "09:36", "a lot of echo chambers because we don't", "09:39", "make it easy for people to follow", "09:42", "interests and topics it's only accounts", "09:45", "we incentivize a lot of outrage and how", "09:49", "hot takes because of the some of the", "09:53", "dynamics in the service not allowing a", "09:55", "lot of nuance and conversation earlier", "09:57", "on pseudonyms this you know this ability", "10:05", "to not use your real name incentivizes", "10:08", "some positive things

people like the example", "10:21", "you mentioned of just random fire and", "10:24", "you know spread of abuse and harassment", "10:27", "throughout so those are the things that", "10:30", "we're looking at and how do we how do we", "10:32", "enable more of the conversation to", "10:34", "evolve how do we increase the", "10:36", "credibility or reputation of accounts", "10:40", "how do we identify credible voices", "10:44", "within a particular domain not just", "10:47", "through this very coarse grain blue", "10:50", "verified badge but if you're an expert", "10:54", "in a particular

deeper conversation or", "11:03", "just ignore you or block them", "11:06", "but what is the conversation like while", "11:08", "you're at work like when you realizing", "11:10", "that all this stuff is happening and", "11:13", "you're realizing that now I mean it", "11:15", "particularly because the president uses", "11:16", "it so often it's such a I mean it's his", "11:19", "preferred platform for communicating", "11:21", "with the people I mean even more so than", "11:23", "addresses it's really it's very strange", "11:26", "what's the conversation like in the", "11:28", "office when you're trying to figure out", "11:29", "hey what's our responsibility here how", "11:31", "are we supposed to handle this or how do", "11:33", "we I mean you're you're in some ways", "11:36", "what Twitter is doing is it it's really", "11:40", "kind of its flavoring the public", "11:44", "narrative its flavoring the way we", "11:46", "communicate with each other in this in", "11:48", "our culture worldwide yeah I mean the", "11:51", "the conversation has definitely evolved", "11:53", "I think in the past we just got super", "11:55", "reactive we were reacting to all the", "11:59", "negative things that we're seeing and", "12:00", "that led to a lot of short-term thinking", "12:03", "more recently we've just looked much", "12:06", "deeper we we don't react to the to the", "12:09", "present day where we look for some of", "12:10", "the patterns and you know we we have a", "12:14", "we have a company that is not just", "12:17", "serving the people of this particular", "12:20", "country the United States this is global", "12:22", "we have global leaders all around the", "12:23", "use all around the world using us in in", "12:26", "different ways some you know more with", "12:29", "the higher velocity some recognize more", "12:33", "of the power some put out statements", "12:36", "some lead conversations but it's looking", "12:40", "at all those dynamics and not trying to", "12:42", "hyper focus on any one particular one", "12:45", "because if we do we're only building it", "12:48", "for one portion of the population or", "12:50", "only one perceived present-day crisis", "12:55", "well what I'm trying to get at was like", "12:58", "okay like when things come up like say", "13:00", "if you find out that there's people from", "13:03", "Isis they're using Twitter and they're", "13:06", "using Twitter and posting things like", "13:07", "what is the conversation like how do", "13:10", "what do we do about this do we let leave", "13:12", "this up do we recognize this as free", "13:14", "speech do we only take it down if", "13:16", "they're calling for murder or", "13:20", "hate speech like what how do you handle", "13:22", "that well it evolves I mean because like", "13:25", "we first saw Isis were in the world to", "13:28", "Isis and we needed to change our policy", "13:30", "to deal with it what was the what was", "13:32", "the initial reaction to it so once you", "13:34", "realized that people from Isis we're", "13:35", "making Twitter accounts and they were", "13:37", "trying to recruit people and doing all", "13:39", "these things what was the what was the", "13:41", "thought process oh it's a question like", "13:42", "what are we going to do about this we", "13:44", "haven't experienced this before we need", "13:46", "to nobody asked me you don't sleep", "13:48", "pioneers no yeah but there there are", "13:51", "people who have experienced in different", "13:53", "forms in different mediums so we reach", "13:55", "out to our government partners for", "13:57", "instance or law enforcement partners we", "13:59", "reach out to our pure companies to ask", "14:01", "if they're seeing the same things that", "14:02", "we're seeing we have a bunch of civil", "14:06", "societies that we talk to to get their", "14:09", "take on as well and we try to balance", "14:10", "that across you know very spectrums", "14:14", "whether it be you know more", "14:18", "organizations that are more focused on", "14:20", "preventing online harassment all the way", "14:22", "to the ACLU and the FF who are", "14:25", "protecting the First Amendment online so", "14:28", "we won't we try to get as many", "14:29", "perspectives as possible take that and", "14:32", "then make some informed decisions but", "14:34", "also realize that we're probably gonna", "14:35", "make some mistakes along the way and all", "14:38", "we can do to correct some of that is", "14:41", "just be open about where we are that's", "14:43", "probably where we failed to most in the", "14:45", "past is we just haven't been open about", "14:47", "our thinking process what led to", "14:50", "particular decisions how our Terms of", "14:54", "Service evolved in terms of service as", "14:57", "an area in our industry is just it's a", "15:01", "mess no one reads them you know you sign", "15:04", "up for these services and you quickly", "15:06", "hit accept yeah and we expect people to", "15:11", "read these rules of the road but they", "15:14", "haven't read them and have you ever read", "15:17", "them I have read read Facebook's", "15:20", "I have a read Facebook's yeah not on it", "15:23", "I'm not on Facebook flat a Facebook", "15:25", "right just kidding what about Instagram", "15:28", "you've read theirs I was uh I was in the", "15:31", "first ten users", "15:33", "of Instagram really kevin was intern", "15:36", "Kevin Systrom was an Internet odyo and I", "15:40", "was one of the first investors of", "15:43", "Instagram and loved the service I don't", "15:45", "think I've ever read their Terms of", "15:46", "Service mmm yeah that's what I'm saying", "15:48", "even you even me but I read ours and you", "15:50", "wanted things I noticed right away is", "15:53", "you know you read our you read our Terms", "15:56", "of Service and one of first things that", "15:58", "we put at the top of the page was", "16:01", "copyright and intellectual property", "16:05", "protections mmm you go down you scroll", "16:08", "down you see everything about violent", "16:10", "threats and abuse and harassment and", "16:14", "safety and it's not that the company", "16:17", "intended for that to be the order it", "16:20", "just we just added things going on but", "16:22", "even a read of that puts forth our point", "16:26", "of view like we're actually putting", "16:29", "copyright infringement above the safety", "16:31", "the physical safety of someone so we", "16:34", "need to relook at some of these things", "16:36", "and how they've evolved and how they", "16:37", "reacted and but is it above just because", "16:39", "it's listed a second I mean is there", "16:41", "essentially all in the same one sheet", "16:43", "there only one sheet when you when you", "16:46", "bring it up when you discuss it first is", "16:48", "that really critical they're all they're", "16:50", "all part of the Terms of Service yeah", "16:51", "but I think that ordering matters like", "16:53", "what what do we consider to be most", "16:55", "important right and we have to consider", "16:57", "physical safety to the to be the one", "17:00", "thing that we protect the most and so", "17:02", "icicle threats physical threats Don", "17:05", "saying daxing anything that impinges on", "17:08", "someone's physical safety this is an", "17:11", "area where I don't think technology and", "17:14", "services like ours have focused on", "17:17", "enough we haven't focused on the f-off", "17:19", "platform ramifications of what happens", "17:21", "online so what do you do like like", "17:25", "here's a good for instance this", "17:26", "situation with this young kid who had", "17:29", "the maggot hat on and the Native", "17:31", "American gentleman who was in front of", "17:32", "him banging the drum and then people are", "17:35", "calling for this kid's name they want", "17:37", "his name they want his address including", "17:38", "Kathy Griffin like how do you how do you", "17:40", "handle something like that", "17:42", "well because that's essentially request", "17:44", "for daxing yeah and and that's that is a", "17:47", "new vector that we haven't seen in mass", "17:49", "and this these are these are the cases", "17:51", "that bring up entirely new things so we", "17:54", "have to study it we have to see how we", "17:56", "reacted what happened with a network but", "18:00", "this goes back to the incentives like we", "18:03", "are incentivizing this very quick", "18:05", "reaction and it's taking away from some", "18:09", "some more of the like considered work", "18:12", "that we need to do to really diagnose", "18:13", "what's happening in the moment and it", "18:16", "was it's such an interesting case study", "18:18", "to see how that evolved over just 48", "18:23", "hours yes and that's one of the most", "18:25", "fascinating new cycles or stories in the", "18:27", "new cycle in quite a while because it's", "18:29", "nuanced there's there's many different", "18:31", "levels to it yeah and a lot of like", "18:34", "really neat jerk reactions totally and", "18:36", "but we helped that well it's just that's", "18:42", "how some of the dynamics of the service", "18:44", "work but is thanks for the service or is", "18:47", "it the way people choose to use the", "18:49", "service like if you are a thoughtful", "18:51", "person you wouldn't just like for", "18:53", "instance the original image that was", "18:55", "distributed came from an account that's", "18:58", "now banned right and so it was it was", "19:01", "discovered that that account was a troll", "19:04", "account what how does that happen and", "19:07", "what what was the the thought process", "19:09", "behind that because the image that they", "19:11", "posted was a legitimate image it really", "19:14", "did happen but wasn't it was a part of", "19:16", "an actual occurring event so what why do", "19:19", "you ban the person or the troll account", "19:21", "that put it up I don't know about this", "19:23", "particular case but it's likely that it", "19:27", "was found there's there's a lot of what", "19:30", "you see on the surface the Twitter and", "19:32", "some of the actions that we take on the", "19:34", "surface but where we spend a lot of our", "19:37", "enforcement is actually what's happening", "19:39", "underneath so in many cases we have", "19:42", "trolls or people like the case that you", "19:46", "mentioned whose sole purpose is just to", "19:50", "harass or abuse or

you", "30:14", "don't need to read through all of them", "30:15", "yeah you might but I also believe that", "30:19", "the most important things to come back", "30:21", "up what I used to do a lot would I would", "30:23", "go through my mentions and when people", "30:25", "would essentially used it as almost a", "30:28", "news aggregator go through my mentions", "30:30", "that people would post cool stories and", "30:32", "then I would retweet those and so", "30:33", "because people knew that I would retweet", "30:35", "them they would send me a lot of cool", "30:36", "stuff so because of that because of", "30:38", "reciprocating I got a lot of really cool", "30:40", "stuff sent my way yeah you're pushing", "30:42", "your pushing we're out to expand the", "30:43", "network yeah and I reinforced it I just", "30:47", "I wanted to thank people for posting", "30:49", "cool stuff and they love the fact they", "30:51", "would get a retweet and so they would", "30:52", "send me like interesting science stories", "30:55", "or you know very bizarre nature stories", "30:57", "and I'd just be retweeting them all the", "30:59", "time code um but then after a while I'm", "31:01", "like mmm this is a lot of time", "31:04", "so a lot of time so now essentially what", "31:06", "I do is I just post something and I just", "31:08", "kind of like way what but that I mean", "31:12", "that that speaks to what we want to", "31:13", "incentivize more we want more people", "31:15", "contributing things back to the network", "31:19", "back to the back to the public", "31:20", "conversation and I I know it doesn't", "31:22", "feel like this today for most people but", "31:26", "my ideal is someone walks away from", "31:29", "Twitter learning something and they're", "31:31", "actually learning something entirely new", "31:33", "I think it might be a new perspective", "31:34", "that happens a lot it probably happens", "31:36", "more often than we anyone we follow", "31:38", "exactly it's all depending on the on the", "31:41", "Twitter you follow and like the you know", "31:44", "that health Twitter is amazing you know", "31:46", "I learned some like I followed Rhonda", "31:49",

"32:02", "views of how to stay healthy how to live", "32:05", "longer and I I can't find that anywhere", "32:08", "else yeah in one place like that and", "32:10", "then it's not just them broadcasting", "32:12", "when they retweet something or when they", "32:14", "tweet something there's a whole", "32:15", "conversation about it so you know some", "32:17", "people say this is you know this has not", "32:20", "been my experience or this is not this", "32:22", "is not true for me or actually have you", "32:24", "seen this connected thing and I I just", "32:27", "go down this rabbit hole and I I learned", "32:30", "so much but that's not the experience", "32:31", "for everyone no well yeah it's not the", "32:34", "experience for everyone and it's not", "32:36", "really I don't think it's what everyone", "32:37", "wants either sometimes people just like", "32:39", "to go on there and talk shit I mean", "32:40", "there's someone that's trapped in a", "32:41", "cubicle right now strapped and they just", "32:43", "want to go in there and get in arguments", "32:44", "about gun control or you know whether or", "32:47", "not Nancy Pelosi is the devil I mean", "32:48", "this is this is what you know it serves", "32:51", "a purpose for them yeah the thing that", "32:53", "gets strange though is who's to decide", "32:57", "you know there's thing this is there's", "32:59", "this concept there's a discussion I", "33:02", "should say where some people believe", "33:05", "that things like Twitter or Facebook or", "33:07", "any forum where you're having a public", "33:09", "discussion should be considered almost", "33:12", "like a public utility like anyone has", "33:14", "access to the electric power even if you", "33:17", "are", "33:18", "you know even if you're a racist you", "33:20", "still can get electricity and some", "33:22", "people think that you should have that", "33:24", "same ability with something like Twitter", "33:26", "or the same ability with something like", "33:28", "Instagram obviously this is we're in", "33:31", "uncharted territory and you or you are", "33:34", "in uncharted territory", "33:35", "totally no one has been there before so", "33:37", "who makes the distinctions when you see", "33:40", "someone that it's saying something that", "33:43", "you might think is offensive to some", "33:46", "folks but not offensive to the person", "33:49", "who's saying it maybe the person who's", "33:50", "saying it feels like they need to", "33:51", "express themselves and this is important", "33:52", "to say and how do you decide whether or", "33:56", "not this is a valid discussion or if", "33:59", "this is air quotes hate speech which is", "34:01", "a you know there's some things that are", "34:04", "hate speech and there's sometimes people", "34:06", "use the term hate speech and it's just a", "34:08", "cheap way to shut down a conversation", "34:10", "yeah we so the simple answer is we look", "34:12", "at conduct we don't we don't look at the", "34:15", "speech of so if we look at conduct we", "34:16", "look at how the tool is being used and", "34:19", "you're you're right in that like I think", "34:22", "when people see Twitter they see and", "34:24", "they expect it to be a public square", "34:26", "they can go into that public square they", "34:29", "can say whatever they want they can get", "34:30", "on the pedestal and people might gather", "34:34", "around them and listen what they have to", "34:36", "say some of them might find it offensive", "34:37", "and they leave the difference is there's", "34:42", "there's also this concept of this", "34:44", "megaphone and the megaphone can be", "34:46", "highly targeted would Twitter as well", "34:48", "right so it's not it's not the it's not", "34:51", "the speech it's how its amplified so", "34:54", "what do you do is like say let's let's", "34:56", "say there's someone in the media let's", "34:57", "say it's a prominent feminist and then", "35:00", "you have a bunch of people or let's say", "35:02", "just one person and their Twitter feed", "35:04", "is overwhelmingly attacking this", "35:06", "prominent feminists just consoling", "35:08", "attacking or calling her a liar calling", "35:11", "her this calling that when do you decide", "35:13", "this is harassment when decide this is", "35:15", "hate speech when like how do you", "35:16", "immediately look at the concepts there's", "35:18", "a fictional account right yes you know", "35:20", "person we're talking about but in this", "35:22", "for instance what what would dictate", "35:27", "something that was egregious enough for", "35:30", "you to eliminate them from your plot", "35:32", "well that's a that's a that's a heavy", "35:35", "action so that's the last resort but we", "35:38", "look at the conduct we look at", "35:39", "oftentimes as you said like the the", "35:42", "probability of someone who is harassing", "35:47", "one person it's highly probable that", "35:49", "they're also harassing ten more people", "35:51", "right so we can look at that behavior we", "35:53", "can look at how many times this person", "35:56", "is being blocked or muted or reported", "36:00", "and based on all those all that data we", "36:03", "can actually take some action but we", "36:05", "also have to we have to correlate it", "36:07", "with the other side of that because", "36:09", "people go on and they coordinate blocks", "36:12", "as well and they coordinate harassment", "36:15", "and they and they coordinate I'm sorry", "36:17", "not harassment but reporting reporting a", "36:20", "particular account to get it shut down", "36:21", "and to to take the voice off the service", "36:24", "so these are the considerations we have", "36:27", "to make but it's it's it all starts with", "36:29", "conduct and all oftentimes we'll see", "36:32", "coordinated conduct whether it be that", "36:35", "one person opening multiple accounts or", "36:37", "coordinating with multiple accounts that", "36:39", "they don't own to you know go after", "36:42", "someone and there's a bunch of vectors", "36:44", "that people use retweet for that the", "36:46", "quote tweet for that a lot as well like", "36:48", "you know they'll quote tweet a tweet", "36:51", "that someone finds and they'll say look", "36:53", "at this idiot Twitter do your thing and", "36:55", "then just this mob starts and goes and", "36:58", "tries to effectively shut that person", "37:01", "down so there's a bunch of tools we can", "37:04", "use the permanent suspension is the last", "37:07", "resort one of the things that we can do", "37:09", "is we can down rank the replies so any", "37:14", "of these any of these behaviors and", "37:15", "conduct that looks linked linked we can", "37:18", "actually push farther down in the reply", "37:21", "chain so it's all still there but you", "37:23", "might have to push a button to actually", "37:26", "see it you might have to show more", "37:28", "replies to actually see this harassing", "37:31", "account or what might look like", "37:34", "harassing language and this is manually", "37:37", "done no this is this is all this is all", "37:40", "automated its automated yeah yeah but", "37:42", "how would you love the ranking in the", "37:44", "and looking at", "37:45", "and looking at the network is is", "37:47", "automated right like in terms of down", "37:49", "ranking is there a discussion as to", "37:51", "whether or not this person's replies", "37:52", "should be down ranked like how do you", "37:54",

were", "53:13", "looking you were to look at the", "53:14", "presidency of Obama", "53:16", "it wasn't exactly the same tone in this", "53:19", "exact same language but there were", "53:21", "threats around the same country and we", "53:24", "have to take that context into", "53:26", "consideration so the second thing is", "53:28", "that we need the most controversial", "53:31", "aspect of our

is this a is this something that", "54:22", "the public has interest in and I believe", "54:26", "generally the answer is yes it's not", "54:28", "going to be in every case but generally", "54:29",

how", "54:50", "someone uses that platform and when", "54:52", "someone uses it the way he uses it and", "54:54", "then becomes president and continues to", "54:57", "use it that way that's when people like", "54:58", "what he's been consistent and I think I", "55:00", "think he joined in in 2009 2012 yeah you", "55:04", "look at all of his tweets all the way", "55:05", "back then and it's pretty consistent", "55:07", "yeah I mean he likes to install people", "55:10", "on Twitter it's fun no it's just I never", "55:13", "thought he would keep doing it I thought", "55:15", "once he became president maybe he just", "55:17", "lock it down try to do a good job for", "55:18", "the country and then you know after four", "55:20", "years or eight years just go back to his", "55:23",

yeah", "71:26", "that was the inspiration and and what we", "71:28", "took from that was being able to like if", "71:30", "you could do that from anywhere not", "71:31", "bound to a desk but you could do that", "71:32", "from anywhere and you could do from your", "71:34", "phone and you could just be roaming", "71:35", "around and say you know I'm I'm at Joe", "71:38", "Rogan's studio right now

"72:18", "profiles and this network that developed", "72:21", "between people and that is facebook", "72:23", "facebook facebook optimized the hell out", "72:27", "of that and they scaled the world we we", "72:31", "were something very different we you", "72:33", "know we we started with that simple", "72:35", "status and then people wanted to talk", "72:38", "about it we we decided that it should be", "72:40", "on the same surface it shouldn't be", "72:41", "suburbian to the to the to the status it", "72:44", "should be part of that flow and that's", "72:47", "what makes Twitter you know so

five-second", "80:45", "two 30-second delay in descending and", "80:48", "within that window you can edit I'm", "80:50", "gonna need more time than that dude if I", "80:53", "fuck something up I like

you", "81:17", "know it's the roar of the crowd it's", "81:19", "like you know looking across at someone", "81:22", "you're in this virtual stadium with and", "81:24", "just saying like oh my god that shot can", "81:26", "you believe it but isn't isn't clarity", "81:29", "more important because you're not gonna", "81:31", "depend on the context yeah can I have", "81:33", "the ability to communicate quickly yeah", "81:35", "but you also have the ability to clarify", "81:37", "that's that's where we need to really", "81:40", "pay attention because if you're if", "81:44", "you're in the context of an NBA game you", "81:47", "want to be fast and you just want to be", "81:48", "at the moment you just you know you want", "81:50", "to be raw but if you're in the context", "81:51", "of considering what the president just", "81:53", "did or making a particular statement", "81:55", "then you probably need some some more", "81:57", "time and and we can be dynamic there", "81:59", "what's interesting to me is how few", "82:01", "people use video like I thought", "82:04", "you guys have video on Twitter Michael a", "82:06", "bunch of people gonna be making videos", "82:08", "and putting those up on Twitter and it's", "82:10", "not it's not that often it depends on", "82:13", "who you follow it it's huge", "82:14", "for some aspects of Twitter it's it's", "82:16", "it's less so and others but what aspects", "82:19", "is it huge for a lot of a lot of sports", "82:22", "I mean we see a lot of like just the the", "82:24", "replays and the recaps", "82:25", "right for sure you know aspects of a", "82:29", "particular shot that people want to", "82:30", "comment on I don't like I think it's", "82:32", "dangerous for us to to focus too much on", "82:34", "the medium whether it be images or gifts", "82:37", "or video it's it's more about the", "82:39", "conversation around it like that's what", "82:40", "we want optimized for it's definitely", "82:42", "very popular for sports and in Folly and", "82:46", "you know there's a what is a there's", "82:49", "there's a bunch of animal attack videos", "82:51", "the yeah natures metals a good one and", "82:55", "hold my beer that's another good one I", "82:58", "mean it's all videos but what I meant", "83:01", "was people making a video talking yeah", "83:04", "that's something yeah this is what I was", "83:05", "trying to say what I think is this in", "83:07", "that blah blah blah you don't see a lot", "83:10", "of that and I thought maybe that would", "83:11", "be something that people would adopt", "83:13", "more it's a different speed you know and", "83:15", "I think like the the consumption of", "83:17", "video I mean you see this in the", "83:18", "technology right now like people are", "83:20", "subtitling every

watched the whole damn video so", "83:39", "like the ability to clip something the", "83:41", "ability to like index in I think is", "83:43", "really critical so it's not to me it's", "83:45", "not about the format it's about the the", "83:47", "use case in the context of urine now", "83:49", "going back to the responsibility that", "83:52", "you guys have and you in particular like", "83:55",

mean there's been a lot of", "87:07", "criticism may be justified in some ways", "87:10", "that tech companies all lean left but", "87:12", "what is interesting to me is that name", "87:16", "another

and that's extremely valuable", "87:54", "and something that we need to really", "87:56", "really honor but I agree with you I mean", "87:59", "like look at look at Tesla you know", "88:01", "they're you know I I just listened to", "88:04", "the the recent earnings call and one of", "88:07", "the things that yuan said was look there", "88:10", "are two reasons for Tesla number one is", "88:13",

culture and this", "89:27", "is a this is something that is really", "89:31", "only applicable to tech companies in", "89:34", "some strange way and it's weird that so", "89:37", "many of them share this like I was", "89:41", "personally a little weirded out when", "89:43", "Google took out don't be evil like that", "89:47", "was a big part of their operating model", "89:49", "they take that out yes yes right make", "89:53", "sure that I don't want you sued pretty", "89:55", "sure they removed that from what would", "89:58", "you call that there there are", "90:00", "operational directive like what is", "90:03", "wasn't a code of conduct of conduct and", "90:06", "it's not there anymore right they", "90:08", "removed it so yeah that's the article", "90:09", "that says they removed the clause and", "90:11", "this is a weird thing to tell people not", "90:14", "to be evil there's another way they", "90:23", "changed it to do the right thing yeah oh", "90:25", "well what does that mean the fuck does", "90:28", "do the right thing mean do the right", "90:30", "thing so you can make more money you", "90:32", "know like hey we're gonna make money", "90:34", "we'll do the right thing it makes more", "90:35", "money yeah I mean it's I mean that's", "90:37", "that's why like that's why this openness", "90:40", "is so critical I mean that's why I like", "90:41", "the public comment to me the public", "90:43", "conversation is so important is we can", "90:45", "talk about stuff like that and like", "90:46", "there will be companies forming today", "90:48", "that look at objectives and mandates", "90:51", "like that and base their whole culture", "90:55", "around it and is that the right idea", "90:57", "well no but if we're not talking about", "90:58", "it we won't be able to answer that", "91:00", "question", "91:00", "well it's also interesting because", "91:01", "Google is so all-encompassing right you", "91:05", "have Gmail you have Android I mean that", "91:09", "is they are the number one operating", "91:12", "system for mobile phones in the world on", "91:14", "top of being a search engine there's so", "91:16", "much involved in that company and again", "91:20", "like almost all tech companies they", "91:22", "heavily lean left and they because they", "91:26", "had that don't be evil as a part of", "91:28", "their code of conduct it seemed like", "91:31", "something that was a good idea to have", "91:33", "like and it sort of defined what I was", "91:36", "talking about that tech companies are", "91:38", "uniquely progressive yeah I mean I I", "91:42", "don't know I don't know what makes that", "91:44", "I think um no matter what like we the", "91:51", "Internet allows for a very healthy", "91:54", "skepticism of nearly

bunch of", "100:11", "people are in the room then he starts", "100:13", "talking yeah and I just I find I find", "100:16", "that so interesting because that is the", "100:18", "future of conversation

actually", "101:31", "meditating with them mmm there's", "101:33", "something powerful about it and like", "101:35", "what can we do to improve that", "101:36", "experience what about people using

shut down we", "102:15", "shut down things a little bit too early", "102:17", "we did this at square-like we had this", "102:19", "amazing technology and a pile of called", "102:22", "square wallet

thing", "102:59", "that I didn't want to give up on and", "103:02", "that was that was the cash app like for", "103:04", "four years it was just a slog like a lot", "103:09", "of people in the company wanted to shut", "103:11", "down the thing they saw it as something", "103:13", "that wasn't successful and you know", "103:15", "recently the team reached number one in", "103:18", "the in the App

it's um", "104:00", "it's a great way to save money - I mean", "104:02", "when you can save 10% at Whole Foods", "104:03", "yeah I mean that's that's real well if", "104:06", "the other thing is like the the", "104:08", "population that we serve typically are", "104:12", "underserved by banks or unbanked", "104:14", "entirely yeah I'd say we", "104:16", "are their bank account right but more",

don't know what the", "104:40", "fuck we're talking about the cash app", "104:42", "has a thing called a cash card which is", "104:43", "a debit card that you get with it and", "104:45", "there's a thing called boosts and with", "104:46", "boosts all you do is pick a boost in the", "104:48", "app and then use your cash card as a", "104:50", "debit card and you get these automatic", "104:53",

small team", "105:16", "but they're doing some big things well I", "105:17", "hear a lot of good things about it too", "105:19", "I've run into people on the street to", "105:20", "tell me they use and they're very happy", "105:22", "about it so it's it's nice to see again", "105:24", "an emerging technology that's profitable", "105:27", "but yet also has a really good really", "105:30", "good set of ethics yeah yeah do you have", "105:33", "don't be evil and know why don't one of", "105:39", "our one of our like equivalent operating", "105:42", "principles within cash and square is", "105:45", "like under like how do we understand", "105:47", "someone's struggle like how do we", "105:49", "understand like how do we have the", "105:50", "empathy for like what they're struggling",

thought process with I", "105:59", "mean one of the things that's kind of", "106:00", "cool about the cash app is that you can", "106:02", "buy and sell Bitcoin with it yeah are", "106:04", "you going you guys going to consider", "106:06", "other forms of cryptocurrency as well", "106:08", "not right now I so back to the internet", "106:11", "I believe that it or not will have a", "106:12", "native currency really it'll have a", "106:15", "native currency and I don't know if it's", "106:16", "Bitcoin it I think it will because just", "106:18", "given all the tests it's been through", "106:20", "and the principles behind it how it was", "106:23", "created and you know it's it was", "106:25", "something that was born on the internet", "106:27", "that was developed on the internet that", "106:29", "was", "106:30", "test it on the it is of the internet and", "106:33", "the reason we you know we enabled the", "106:38", "purchasing of bitcoin with them within", "106:40", "the cash app is one we want to learn", "106:43", "about the technology and we want to put", "106:44", "ourselves out there and take some risk", "106:45", "we're the first publicly traded company", "106:47", "to actually offer it as a service or the", "106:50", "first publicly traded company to talk to", "106:52", "the SEC about Bitcoin and what that what", "106:55", "that means and it made us uncomfortable", "106:58", "we had to we had to you know like really", "107:00", "understand what was going on and and", "107:02", "that was critical and important and then", "107:04", "the second thing is that we you know we", "107:08", "would we would love to see something", "107:10", "become a global currency I did it", "107:13", "enables more access it allows us to", "107:15", "serve more people it allows us to move", "107:17", "much faster around the world and we we", "107:21", "we thought we were going to start with", "107:23", "how you can use it transactionally but", "107:27", "we noticed that people were treating it", "107:30", "more like an asset like a like a virtual", "107:32", "gold and we wanted to we want to just to", "107:36", "make that easy like just the simplest", "107:39", "way to buy and sell Bitcoin but we also", "107:41", "knew that it had to come with a lot of", "107:45", "education I had to come with constraint", "107:47", "because you know two years ago people", "107:51", "did some really unhealthy things about", "107:53", "you know purchasing pickle and they", "107:55", "maxed out their credit cards and put all", "107:58", "their life savings and in the Bitcoin so", "108:00", "we we developed some very simple", "108:02", "restrictions and constraints like you", "108:04", "can all you can't buy Bitcoin on the", "108:05", "cash out with a credit card you have to", "108:07", "it has to be the money you actually have", "108:09", "in it and we look for a day trading", "108:11", "which we we discourage and shut down", "108:14", "like that that's not what we were trying", "108:16", "to build that's not what we were trying", "108:17", "to optimize for we made a children's", "108:21", "book explaining what bitcoin is and", "108:23", "where it came from and how people use it", "108:26", "and where it might be going so we we", "108:28", "really tried to take on the role of", "108:29", "Education and and and to have some like", "108:33", "very simple healthy constraints that", "108:36", "allowed to be allowed people to consider", "108:39", "what their actions are and in this", "108:41", "now when you have something like the", "108:42", "cash out which is it's very much a", "108:44", "disruptive technology in terms of like", "108:47", "decentralization of of banks and and", "108:52", "currency and you know to have it where", "108:55", "everything is going right at your direct", "108:57", "depositing a paycheck right in the app", "108:59", "if you so choose and then you could also", "109:00", "buy Bitcoin which is another disruptive", "109:03", "technology I mean that this is another", "109:06", "step towards this sort of new way of", "109:11", "doing things no", "109:12", "and is there pushback from from any", "109:15", "companies or is there oh yeah you know I", "109:18", "mean like you just look at like some of", "109:20", "the major banks and their consideration", "109:22", "around Bitcoin they all love blockchain", "109:24", "because of the efficiencies it can", "109:26", "create for their business and", "109:27", "potentially new business lines but you", "109:30", "know I think there is a explain block to", "109:32", "defeat before people don't know where", "109:33", "the black black chain is a distributed", "109:35", "ledger and it what that means is that", "109:38", "it's basically a distributed database", "109:39", "where you know the the source of truth", "109:42", "can be verified at any point around the", "109:45", "network and you can see you know this", "109:48", "this annotation around how content or", "109:51", "how round money like traveled so you", "109:54", "don't have to go to an institution so", "109:56", "the records yeah there's no centralized", "109:58", "check there's no centralized control", "109:59", "over it and I think that is threatening", "110:02", "it's it's it's certainly threatening to", "110:05", "certain services behind banks and", "110:08", "financial institutions it's threatening", "110:10", "to some governments as well so I just", "110:14", "look at this and like how do we embrace", "110:15", "this technology not react to it and I", "110:18", "you know more from a threat standpoint", "110:20", "but like what does it enable us to do", "110:23", "and where does our value shift and", "110:25", "that's what we should be talking about", "110:27", "right now is like how our value shifts", "110:29", "and there's always really strong answers", "110:31", "to that question but if you're not", "110:33", "willing to ask the question the
