tell that story because sure I'll do", "07:52", "the the quick and dirty version", "07:53", "cliffnotes I was a freshman at Penn a", "07:58", "friend of mine was rushing a fraternity", "08:01", "and that fraternity was holding what", "08:05", "they called a mystery event and I wasn't", "08:08", "rushing a fraternity I wasn't interested", "08:09", "but he convinced me that I didn't have", "08:11",

in which the fraternity had", "08:25", "hired prostitutes black prostitutes from", "08:29", "the local environment and the situation", "08:32", "Penn is in a pretty rough neighborhood", "08:34", "and this was a pretty wealthy Jewish", "08:37", "frat and so there was you know something", "08:40", "pretty unsettling about a wealthy Jewish", "08:43", "frat hiring black prostitutes from the", "08:45", "local neighborhood to engage in what", "08:49", "started out to be a striptease as this", "08:51", "thing began to unfold and I realized I", "08:53", "didn't have any interest in being part", "08:54", "of this event I made one of the bigger", "08:56", "mistakes of my life and I left the event", "08:58", "but when my friend and other members of", "09:02", "the fraternity rolled into the dorm that", "09:04", "night and told me what happened I was", "09:06", "absolutely appalled because what had", "09:08", "happened was the fraternity had enacted", "09:12", "a amok rape of these prostitutes using", "09:17", "cucumbers and ketchup and the idea that", "09:23", "there was anything acceptable about a", "09:25", "you know an organization that had", "09:27", "special privileges on the campus", "09:28", "behaving this way I couldn't get past it", "09:33", "and so anyway I went to the paper and", "09:35", "various things unfolded the paper", "09:37", "botched the story and made it look like", "09:40", "I was troubled by the fact that there", "09:43", "were strippers rather than troubled by", "09:44", "what actually had ended up happening and", "09:46", "I ended up writing an editorial for the", "09:49", "for the paper and all hell broke loose", "09:52", "there was you know I got death threats", "09:55", "the police started tracking phone", "09:58", "numbers on my phone to see who was", "09:59", "threatening me ultimately there was a", "10:01", "trial of the fraternity the college did", "10:04", "not want to put the fraternity on trial", "10:05", "but ultimately public pressure forced", "10:07", "them to do it", "10:08", "um I testified at the trial although", "10:11", "since I hadn't seen the thing directly", "10:12", "what I could say was limited but while I", "10:15", "was in the the witness room with the", "10:18", "other witnesses people who had rushed", "10:20", "the fraternity but had not pledged at", "10:22", "the fraternity brothers including I", "10:25", "believe the president came into the", "10:26", "witness room and started bullying these", "10:28", "witnesses and coaching them on what they", "10:29", "should say in front of this this", "10:32", "University panel anyway ultimately the", "10:35", "the University was the University", "10:37", "through the the frat off campus for a", "10:40", "year forbid them from pledging a class", "10:43", "and anyway there's a lot more to the", "10:47", "story I got an award from the National", "10:49", "Organization for Women actually for", "10:52", "I forgot their terminology but for", "10:55", "basically for standing up for four women", "10:57", "who needed to be defended or something", "11:00", "like that you you said you've made the", "11:02", "biggest mistake one of the biggest", "11:03", "mistakes your life by leaving", "11:04", "I mean meaning that if you were there", "11:06", "you could have probably stopped it or", "11:07", "you could at least have known exactly", "11:09", "what was going on there's no way I could", "11:11", "have stopped it but I left because I", "11:15", "didn't want to be party to right event", "11:19", "that sometime I think you know", "11:20", "journalists know this I was you know", "11:22", "freshman in college so I didn't know it", "11:24", "yet but journalists understand that", "11:26", "sometimes something horrifying happens", "11:29", "and the job that you are best positioned", "11:32", "to do is documenting it so that the", "11:34", "world can understand how such things", "11:35", "occur and do something about it and if I", "11:38", "had understood that that was probably my", "11:41", "highest and best use at that moment I", "11:43", "would have stuck around and paid", "11:45", "attention to what had happened rather", "11:47", "than having to go through convincing the", "11:49", "world that something had happened which", "11:50", "I had not directly seen yeah I mean how", "11:54", "could you have known", "11:55", "there's no I don't think you should be", "11:56", "hard on yourself at all you're 18 right", "11:59", "exactly how could you have known and how", "12:01", "could you have known even if you were 30", "12:03", "how could you've know what was going to", "12:05", "happen it looked like prostitutes you", "12:06", "like that I want to be here right see", "12:08", "yeah exactly", "12:09", "you didn't know there was gonna be a", "12:10", "mock rape right I couldn't have known", "12:13", "but in any case in retrospect it was a", "12:15", "mistake it's so it's so crazy that they", "12:17", "let groups of kids live in a house", "12:20", "together and get hammered when they", "12:22", "don't even have their frontal cortex", "12:23", "develop yet I mean they're all living", "12:25", "together feeding off of each other", "12:27", "you have mob mentality all this", "12:29", "diffusion of responsibility because you", "12:31", "have a large group of people that's also", "12:33", "like you and everybody's it's it's so", "12:34", "bananas that that is few incidents", "12:38", "happen as they do I mean you would think", "12:40", "that those things would just be chaos", "12:42", "the moment you open up the door to every", "12:44", "frat house yeah and you know there's", "12:45", "more chaos than we know because a lot of", "12:47", "what takes place we don't we don't find", "12:49", "out about but it's a shame because one", "12:52", "could take the thing that drives people", "12:54", "into those organizations and one could", "12:56", "use it to power something that was", "12:58", "useful and interesting yeah and you know", "13:01", "really was deeply enriching and I know", "13:03", "there you know", "13:04", "how much flak am I going to take for", "13:05", "giving the fraternity system a hard time", "13:07", "on your podcast but plenty of people", "13:10", "will tell me how enriching their", "13:12", "fraternity experience was and you know", "13:14", "even at Penn there were a couple", "13:15", "fraternities that were I was as you can", "13:20", "imagine hated throughout the fraternity", "13:22", "system at Penn after I had come forward", "13:25", "but there were two fraternities that", "13:27", "actually didn't hate me and were", "13:28", "welcoming even in that climate so I", "13:30", "don't want to portray them solana", "13:32", "they're not but but it does seem like a", "13:35", "wasted opportunity that that kind of", "13:37", "energy that goes into a fraternity life", "13:39", "could be directed to something really", "13:42", "amazing and it's a shame that it doesn't", "13:43", "happen more often well I'm sure there's", "13:45", "a lot of great camaraderie and it's", "13:46", "probably a lot of fun to go through that", "13:48", "experience together with people that are", "13:49", "your same age you're actually living in", "13:51", "a house together but just man you should", "13:53", "probably have some fucking adults in", "13:54", "that room something like that it seems", "13:57", "like it just seems like you know just to", "14:00", "limit your liability yep right 35 year", "14:05", "olds running around going hey what are", "14:07", "you doing out don't like that one on", "14:15", "fire yeah just I don't know it's just", "14:18", "crazy", "14:19", "so that's your situation so anybody that", "14:21", "would think of you as a conservative or", "14:24", "a racist it's like it's clearly the", "14:27", "evidence points to the contrary", "14:29", "well I you know this issue of", "14:31", "conservatism is one that I would like to", "14:34", "also get right and I'm not sure I ever", "14:35", "say this in a way that people know what", "14:37", "I'm talking about but I'm I'm very", "14:39", "progressive but I'm very progressive", "14:41", "because I live in a world that's really", "14:43", "screwed up and so the idea that we have", "14:45", "to make some progress seems just", "14:47", "transparently correct to me yeah I would", "14:50", "like to live in a world that is so well", "14:52", "structured that I could be a", "14:53", "conservative in it and I don't mean a", "14:55", "conservative in the sense the", "14:56", "ideological sense I mean I would like to", "14:58", "be in a world where tinkering with it", "15:01", "stood a better chance of making it worse", "15:03", "and was unnecessary", "15:05", "and so that that would that would turn", "15:07", "me into a conservative because it would", "15:09", "be the right thing to be and then a", "15:11", "proper analysis would tell you this is", "15:13", "the time to conserve the structure", "15:15", "rather than change it", "15:17", "but in this world yeah it turns out I'm", "15:19", "a progressive and the events that people", "15:22", "keep telling me that they they're sure", "15:25", "I'm now a closeted conservative that the", "15:27", "what I faced must have turned me against", "15:30", "the left and that's that's not at all", "15:31", "what happened yeah I agree with you I've", "15:34", "faced that myself that people say uh you", "15:37", "know you're you're gonna turn more", "15:38", "conservative with all this no I'm just", "15:40", "more resentful of these this fake", "15:43", "progressive movement that like you said", "15:45", "has ulterior motives there's there's", "15:48", "more to it there's it's and it's not", "15:49", "it's not accurate like the the", "15:53", "portrayals of humans in in these", "15:56", "movements are not accurate it's not so I", "15:58", "don't think it's healthy I don't think", "16:00", "it's normal and I think there's a lot of", "16:03", "there look the kit the game of", "16:05", "capitalism is a very confusing one and", "16:07", "there's certainly certainly some very", "16:08", "evil aspects to it right but the idea", "16:12", "that the the answer is Marxism seems to", "16:16", "me to be just as just as poorly", "16:19", "thought-out no it it's it it's at least", "16:22", "as poorly bounced um you know Marxism", "16:25", "the flaw is more obvious I think the", "16:28", "flaw is what we in biology would call", "16:31", "group selection the belief that if we", "16:34", "just all row in the same direction we'll", "16:36", "get somewhere marvelous and that's true", "16:38", "that if we did all row into some same", "16:39", "direction we would but there's a very", "16:41", "good game theoretic reason that that", "16:43", "can't be yeah that as soon as you have", "16:45", "everybody rowing in the same direction", "16:46", "then the wind goes to the person who", "16:49", "figures out how not to row and gets the", "16:51", "benefit of everybody else's rowing in", "16:53", "that direction while they sweep in the", "16:55", "profits and so that tears apart anything", "16:58", "structured the way communism is", "16:59", "structured yeah and that's conveniently", "17:02", "ignored I think I really have always", "17:04", "believed that competition is good

people", "17:13", "but ultimately you're really competing", "17:15", "against yourself because you're trying", "17:17", "to better yourself and I believe that", "17:19", "that's the argument for getting children", "17:21", "involved in athletics or games or", "17:23", "something that's very difficult to do", "17:25", "whether it's chess or pool or it's", "17:27", "something I think things that are hard", "17:29", "to do or", "17:30", "good for you competing is good for you", "17:32", "because it teaches you about focus and", "17:34", "discipline and understanding that", "17:36",

one of the", "47:05", "things that I found particularly with", "47:07", "athletics is that people who are", "47:08", "extraordinarily gifted oftentimes don't", "47:11", "excel because it seems to come

now", "48:28", "following me and I was seeing their", "48:30", "their tweets and things but this guy I", "48:32", "think his name is John kirbo posted an", "48:35", "article that he had written about

"51:34", "way he violated all of the rules about", "51:36", "what good archery form looks like hmm", "51:38", "and so he made a response video English", "51:40", "isn't his first language so it's a", "51:42", "little hard to follow but but anyway", "51:44", "it's pretty clear that what he's done is", "51:47", "he's just said well okay there are bows", "51:49", "there are arrows what is the best way to", "51:51", "think about these things from the point", "51:53", "of view of solving these different", "51:54", "problems and he's discovered a whole", "51:55", "landscape of stuff that I don't

would do that let's say", "103:22", "this is these are abstract idea", "103:24", "right how would we how do we eliminate", "103:26", "predators how would we eliminate", "103:28", "predators you would eliminate predators", "103:31", "by disincentive oh so your question", "103:38", "actually has a hidden assumption built", "103:41", "into it you've seen the market as a", "103:43", "mature entity

"104:24", "such a thing is that we have what's", "104:26", "called Dunbar's number right and", "104:28", "Dunbar's number is basically a limit in", "104:31", "the low hundreds of how am i able you", "104:34", "can keep in your head right and so the", "104:36", "point is we are we are adapted to that", "104:37", "and that number is probably an indicator", "104:39", "of something like the number of people", "104:42", "that you can adaptively interact with", "104:45", "yeah I mean in other words if you had I", "104:48", "mean this is really the motivation for", "104:50", "your question if you had a hundred and", "104:51", "fifty people and somebody was a bad", "104:53", "actor their reputation would precede", "104:55", "them and you would you would detect I", "104:57", "should be careful interacting with that", "104:59", "person so the structure would be set up", "105:01", "for tribes which is essentially how we", "105:03", "evolved right I mean that's what", "105:04", "Dunbar's number essentially reveals is", "105:06", "that we evolved growing up in groups of", "105:09", "you know fifty to a couple hundred", "105:12", "people and those are the amount of", "105:13", "people that you can keep in your mind", "105:15", "right so harddrive space essentially we", "105:19", "do but we also human beings are very", "105:22", "good at taking a technological solution", "105:26", "and cluding or hacking a remedy for a", "105:31", "problem like that so for example you", "105:34", "onboard", "105:35", "in your mind", "105:36", "have the ability to track something like", "105:37", "150 individuals with respect to their", "105:40", "reputation so that you know how much to", "105:42", "trust in any given interaction in a", "105:44", "group of you know 1,500 you don't on the", "105:48", "other hand reputation can accumulate in", "105:51", "some way that you can check it through", "105:53", "people who you know right so people", "105:55", "whose reputations are directly known to", "105:58", "you are capable of giving you a", "105:59", "reference and in fact you you know that", "106:00", "this works because interpersonally if", "106:03", "somebody you trusted to a great extent", "106:06", "gave you a recommendation of somebody", "106:08", "else you would you would know how to", "106:10", "evaluate it so we are unfortunately for", "106:16", "both better and worse we are living in a", "106:18", "technological landscape that doesn't", "106:20", "look like anything that our ancestors", "106:22", "faced that provides mechanisms for", "106:29", "building

true", "106:59", "for a replacement system for for planet", "107:02", "Earth the the key is understanding that", "107:06", "there are certain values that all", "107:07", "reasonable people agree on

like because there are predators", "107:29", "who they themselves are unfortunate", "107:33", "mentally they themselves have a deficit", "107:37", "of thinking and we're dealing with such", "107:39",

"107:47", "first thing that you would want to do", "107:49", "is you would want to build so if you", "107:51", "came to me and you said I have a social", "107:55", "network and it provides 85% of

right", "108:09", "right but you are an intellectual and", "108:12", "you are rare in that regard that you're", "108:15", "worried about this these people that are", "108:16", "in Silicon Valley that are talking about", "108:19", "the dangers of the things they've", "108:20", "created themselves they're rare", "108:22", "most people like look at all the likes", "108:24", "right but well but okay so there's", "108:28", "something bored at work right and one", "108:30", "check their likes yes but I mean likes", "108:32", "my butt pic that's what it's a lot of it", "108:35", "you must have a

well yeah only intellectuals are", "108:52", "gonna get why they should want such a", "108:55", "thing but it's really it's not accurate", "108:56", "I mean for one thing the world is", "108:57",

"110:02", "I think that's way off because I think", "110:04", "there's like a billion Catholics well if", "110:07", "you're gonna call Catholicism a good", "110:09", "it's a call I grew up in it okay uh it's", "110:12", "just a cult with a billion people well", "110:15", "you got a guy who dresses like a wizard", "110:16", "and sitting on a golden throne no boys", "110:19", "right yeah that's that's but but that is", "110:22", "why this is a problem is that there's", "110:25", "many people that live their lives by", "110:27", "these ridiculous ideologies that are", "110:32", "illogical

"111:17", "in Jerusalem actually believe that was", "111:19", "all about now the whole burning bush", "111:21", "tell me they believe in there's the", "111:22", "acacia bush which is rich in DMT and", "111:25", "they think the metaphor of the burning", "111:27", "bush was actually a psychedelic", "111:28", "experience and that Moses during this", "111:31", "psychedelic DMT experience came back",

have", "111:44", "gotten from these psychedelic", "111:45", "experiences that you have to treat each", "111:46", "other as if we're all one and that our", "111:48", "separations are all illusions that you", "111:51", "are literally living a life that if I", "111:54", "was born in your body and I had your", "111:57", "genetics I would be you and you would be", "111:59", "me because we are all the

exist in this world okay", "112:15", "like this is essentially what the 3000", "112:18", "year old version of Moses or more than", "112:20", "that Moses his tablets were that they", "112:23", "were the God was the burning bush", "112:25", "perfect perfect", "112:28", "so can I ask you a question you've done", "112:29", "some hallucinogens oh yeah and you've", "112:31", "had some insight yeah and that insight", "112:33", "had something to do with treating people", "112:35", "yes definitely okay was it true well it", "112:39", "definitely has benefitted me true or", "112:41", "false", "112:42",

this is exactly parallel to what we", "123:32", "were talking about before there is the", "123:34", "predatory version which I would call a", "123:37", "cult right and there is the earnest", "123:40",
