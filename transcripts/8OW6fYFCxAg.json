it starts", "84:03", "rolling and then you you lose your", "84:06", "footing and you fall down the tracks", "84:07", "from the cars but when you get run over", "84:08", "by a train it's not bloody and messy", "84:11", "because they especially if it's been on", "84:12", "the mainline it's rolling really hard", "84:14", "and hot", "84:15", "you put a limb on a track or a body or a", "84:18", "corpse

"84:36", "just ass hold and guts hanging off the", "84:39", "front of the train does that even slow", "84:40", "the train down no never not at all a cow", "84:43", "doesn't smell like it's less than a bug", "84:45", "on your windshield whoa yeah could you", "84:48", "imagine being in the fucking seat the", "84:54", "driving seat I've done it have you've", "84:56", "actually seen it operated

"85:07", "mean imagine though being we were", "85:09", "switching I only operated one within the", "85:11", "yard so I'm probably like 35 40 miles an", "85:14", "hour tops but on the mainland when", "85:15", "they're really rolling they're doing", "85:16", "like 70 72 miles an hour like I said", "85:19", "it's 50 you know a mile and a half long", "85:21", "train with five four or five locomotives", "85:25", "on the front of it all 30,000 horsepower", "85:27", "each so look I mean you'd it's a bag of", "85:30", "fucking blood man you're not even gonna", "85:31", "but it just like do

steel shovel", "85:52", "with like a ax wedge and it Lo and it", "85:55", "just kind of just hangs and it's it's", "85:57", "about six inches off the rail itself and", "86:00", "its whole idea is to just splatter every", "86:02", "push anything out of the way and destroy", "86:04", "it so you keep the train from derailing", "86:06", "because the only thing holding those", "86:08", "things on the rail the inner flange of a", "86:12", "wheel set you know it's there's like a", "86:15", "little three quarter inch lip that kind", "86:18", "of hangs over on the inside of the rails", "86:20", "yeah so it's all just gravity and", "86:22", "downforce keeping that thing going so", "86:25", "you could put like a brick technically", "86:28", "you could take anything a piece of", "86:29", "fucking metal or a car jack and just lay", "86:32", "it on that thing when that train hits it", "86:34", "at 70 miles an hour it's coming off the", "86:36", "rail and everything behind it is still", "86:38", "going 70 miles an hour stacking up", "86:41", "behind it and I mean you go you don't", "86:43", "think about every time you pull up to a", "86:45", "crossing in the city and you see a train", "86:47", "go by ten miles an hour and there's like", "86:49", "20 tankers on there full of raw chlorine", "86:52", "you could really fuck some shit up if", "86:56", "you knew what you were doing you know", "86:58", "kill the whole city you derail that", "87:00", "train we have dos we'd have to think", "87:03", "about that and like Homeland Security", "87:05", "would come out and we have to have", "87:06", "courses and shit but you have so many", "87:09", "miles of track oh yeah you make sure", "87:11", "that nobody does anything are crews that", "87:13", "drive that track on daily basis and
