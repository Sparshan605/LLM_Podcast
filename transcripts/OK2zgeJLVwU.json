"03:50", "joe jorgensen from the libertarian party", "03:53", "and so everybody who thinks there should", "03:54", "be a woman president i actually agree", "03:56", "right now", "03:57", "and that's who we should elect is that", "03:58", "who you're voting for", "04:00", "is that who you're going to vote for", "04:02", "well i can't vote for anybody i live in", "04:04", "puerto rico", "04:05",

"04:12", "no taxation without representation so", "04:15", "what happens is", "04:16", "when you move to puerto rico you no", "04:19", "longer have to pay the federal income", "04:20", "tax", "04:21",

"04:38", "the taxes wow so", "04:40", "you know that's a good trade-off that", "04:42", "i'm you know pretty much everybody is", "04:44", "willing to make so", "04:45", "i can't vote and normally i vote for the", "04:47", "lesser of two evils anyway", "04:49", "and most of the time i vote for the", "04:50", "loser so as far as i'm concerned", "04:53", "giving up my right to vote for the loser",

biden", "05:17", "in in a big way and so it's you know", "05:20", "voting for anybody", "05:21", "it doesn't really matter who you vote", "05:22", "for this is a state like connecticut but", "05:25", "as i was saying the problem for trump", "05:28", "and i was one of the few people who was", "05:31", "in the media", "05:33", "saying that i thought trump had a real", "05:34", "good shot at winning i didn't know it", "05:36", "was in the bad", "05:37", "but i thought that he was more likely to", "05:39", "win than lose you know even though", "05:40", "everybody thought it was a long shot", "05:42", "and the reason that i thought that trump", "05:44", "could win", "05:45", "is because trump was telling the truth", "05:48", "about how bad the economy was he wasn't", "05:51", "regurgitating the lies", "05:53", "uh that the obama administration had", "05:55", "been uh", "05:56", "telling or that wall street had been", "05:58", "telling about how we had a real recovery", "06:00", "i knew that we had a bubble inflated by", "06:03", "the federal reserve", "06:04", "and that beneath that bubble where you", "06:06", "know you can see the stock market at", "06:07", "record highs and these phony", "06:09", "unemployment numbers", "06:10", "i knew laid a weak economy and trump", "06:13", "knew that too", "06:14", "and trump spoke to the forgotten men and", "06:17", "women", "06:17", "of this bubble economy and his message", "06:20", "really resonated", "06:21", "about how we were you know a shadow of", "06:23", "our former self", "06:24", "that our industrial might had decayed we", "06:27", "had all these big trade deficits", "06:29", "that the stock market was a bubble all", "06:31", "the numbers were fake", "06:32", "the real unemployment number rate wasn't", "06:35", "five percent but 20", "06:37", "30 40 and that he was a non-politician", "06:41", "he was going to clean house he was going", "06:42", "to drain the swamp", "06:44", "he was going to put politics aside and", "06:46", "big bring a businessman's perspective", "06:49", "to washington drain that swamp eliminate", "06:52", "the national debt", "06:53", "right make america great again and that", "06:56", "message resonated with a lot of people", "06:58", "and a lot of those people", "07:00", "were maybe afraid to be honest with the", "07:02", "pollsters because they didn't want to", "07:03", "admit", "07:04", "that they were going to vote for this", "07:05", "racist misogynist or whoever", "07:07", "the media was portraying him so i", "07:09", "thought he could win", "07:10", "and and he did but here's the problem", "07:14", "now that he's been in office for three", "07:16", "years he didn't drain the swamp", "07:18", "he made the swamp deeper right he didn't", "07:22", "make get rid of the deficit i mean the", "07:23", "deficit is bigger than ever even before", "07:26", "covet all he did was uh you know nurture", "07:29", "the", "07:30", "bubble that he inherited from from obama", "07:33", "and helped make it get bigger he became", "07:35", "a cheerleader for the stock market he", "07:37", "didn't care it was a bubble", "07:39", "all of a sudden all the government", "07:40", "numbers that were fake under obama", "07:42", "were all of a sudden real like they just", "07:44", "came down from from god on a tablet on", "07:47", "miami sinai", "07:48", "and he began talking about this low", "07:49", "unemployment and this booming economy", "07:51", "the greatest economy", "07:53", "in the history of the world the greatest", "07:54", "economy ever and none of that was true", "07:57", "and so you have the same people who", "07:59", "voted for trump", "08:00", "thinking that he would shake things up", "08:02", "thinking that he would throw a monkey", "08:03", "wrench in the system", "08:04", "and make their lives better and their", "08:06", "lives aren't better they're worse", "08:08", "people have more debt you know the", "08:10", "bubble got bigger the trade deficits", "08:12", "that donald trump criticized are bigger", "08:14", "now", "08:15", "than they were before he was elected and", "08:17", "obviously the deficits are much bigger", "08:19", "even before covet", "08:20", "uh so i just don't see how trump", "08:23", "convinces", "08:24", "those swing voters those blue-collar", "08:26", "reagan democrats and the rust belt", "08:28", "who decided they had nothing to lose and", "08:31", "so to take a chance on trump", "08:32", "why should they vote for him again i", "08:34", "mean now they may take a chance on biden", "08:36", "even though i mean biden doesn't", "08:37", "represent", "08:38", "any any change from the status quo he's", "08:40", "just more the same", "08:42", "uh but you know once you're the insider", "08:44", "and trump's now the insider", "08:46", "you know he doesn't have that edge uh", "08:48", "for reelection", "08:49", "what do you think went wrong and why do", "08:51", "you think trump just made the swamp", "08:53", "deeper", "08:53", "what do you think that he was deceptive", "08:56", "when he was running", "08:57", "or do you think the influences once he", "08:58", "got into office were greater than he", "09:00", "anticipated", "09:01", "what do you think happened well i have", "09:03", "no idea i mean i mean", "09:05", "even ronald reagan right ronald reagan", "09:07", "when he was elected and he was a very", "09:09", "principled conservative right unlike", "09:10", "trump you know he was", "09:12", "he he really uh talked uh a walk the", "09:15", "walk not just talk to talk and he was a", "09:17", "big supporter of barry goldwater", "09:18", "who didn't make it you know when he ran", "09:20", "against lyndon johnson but when", "09:22", "reagan came in he really wanted to", "09:24", "shrink government i mean he campaigned", "09:26", "about cut getting rid of the department", "09:27", "of education uh the department of energy", "09:30", "here i forget", "09:30", "he really wanted to shrink government", "09:32", "and cut spending but he was never able", "09:34", "to do that", "09:35", "right he was able to cut taxes but he", "09:37", "wasn't able to cut spending", "09:39", "trump never really campaigned on cutting", "09:41", "spending he didn't want to talk about", "09:43", "that because he didn't want to alienate", "09:44", "any voters", "09:45", "so he just talked about cutting taxes", "09:47", "and", "09:48", "he did you know officially cut taxes", "09:51", "but he actually raised taxes that is the", "09:55", "important thing that you have to", "09:56", "recognize is that", "09:58", "government spending is taxation and", "10:02", "what happened to government spending", "10:04", "under trump even before", "10:05", "it went through the moon with cover 19.", "10:07", "and we'll get to all the covet stuff", "10:09", "but even before then trump signed on to", "10:12", "all kinds of increases in government", "10:13", "spending", "10:14", "more spending on the military more", "10:16", "spending welfare", "10:18", "huge increases in government spending", "10:20", "that's those are tax hikes", "10:22", "now trump cut income taxes", "10:25", "but the income tax is just one way the", "10:27", "government pays for spending", "10:29", "because all government spending has to", "10:31", "be paid for by the public", "10:32", "one way or another we don't get any", "10:34", "government for free everything the", "10:36", "government does costs us money", "10:37", "so every dime they spend represents", "10:40", "taxation in some form", "10:42", "and what they've been doing is they've", "10:44", "been printing money right the federal", "10:46", "reserve prints money", "10:47", "and in fact right now the federal", "10:49", "reserve is printing about 55 cents", "10:52", "out of every federal dollar that's spent", "10:54", "so more money is being printed", "10:56", "and spent than collected in taxation but", "10:59", "all", "11:00", "that printing all that spending that is", "11:02", "being paid for by a printing pass", "11:04", "we don't get that for free there is a", "11:06", "cost", "11:07", "see when the government takes our money", "11:09", "through an income tax", "11:10", "they take my money that i earned and", "11:13", "they give it to somebody else who didn't", "11:14", "earn it", "11:15", "and now that person spends the money but", "11:16", "because i don't have it i can't spend it", "11:18", "i can't invest it or save it", "11:20", "i don't have it anymore the government", "11:21", "took it from me in taxes but", "11:23", "if the government doesn't take it from", "11:25", "me they just print money", "11:26", "and they hand it to somebody else who", "11:28", "didn't earn it and didn't do any work", "11:29", "didn't", "11:30", "produce any goods or provide any", "11:32", "services they just you know got", "11:34", "money from the government that still", "11:35", "cost me because what happens is when", "11:38", "that money is", "11:38", "spent in the circulation it bids up", "11:41", "prices and so prices are now", "11:43", "higher than they would have been had", "11:44", "that new money not been printed", "11:46", "and so now everything that i want to buy", "11:49", "costs more than it otherwise would have", "11:50", "cost", "11:51", "either the prices went up or it", "11:53", "prevented prices from going down", "11:55", "and so now my purchasing power has been", "11:57", "diminished", "11:58", "and so either the government takes your", "12:00", "money", "12:01", "through an income tax or a sales tax or", "12:03", "something or they take your purchasing", "12:05", "power", "12:06", "through an inflation tax and so that's", "12:08", "what trump decided to do to pay for", "12:10", "government through inflation", "12:12", "rather than taxation but what we know", "12:14", "from history is that is the most", "12:16", "expensive way to pay for government and", "12:18", "in fact", "12:19", "it hits hardest the middle class and the", "12:21", "poor right", "12:22", "because the rich have a lot of assets", "12:25", "they have a lot of debt", "12:26", "where they not consumer debt like on a", "12:28", "credit card but where they borrow money", "12:30", "to accumulate income producing property", "12:33", "uh to buy", "12:34", "companies stocks things like that and so", "12:37", "inflation helps those people", "12:38", "right if you if you have debt to buy", "12:40", "assets inflation wipes out your debt", "12:43", "but if you're just saving money and", "12:44", "working for a living and getting a", "12:46", "paycheck", "12:46", "the inflation tax is very heavy on you", "12:49", "and that inflation tax is going to get", "12:51", "much much higher", "12:53", "uh under biden right for all the talk", "12:55", "about all these big government programs", "12:57", "and we'll talk about that", "12:58", "that he wants to pay for by taxing the", "13:01", "rich the rich aren't going to pay those", "13:02", "taxes", "13:03", "most of the money is going to come from", "13:05", "the poor and the middle class", "13:06", "through the inflation tax but getting", "13:08", "back to you know where i think", "13:10", "trump went wrong so trump gets into", "13:12", "office", "13:13", "and he had promised to make america", "13:14", "great again and the reason that america", "13:17", "is not great is because government is", "13:19", "too big", "13:20", "right when america was great right we", "13:23", "had very very small government", "13:24", "government was you know an afterthought", "13:26", "right on all levels maybe state federal", "13:29", "and local maybe it was five percent of", "13:31", "gdp", "13:32", "we didn't have an income tax corporate", "13:33", "or personal we didn't have social", "13:35", "security", "13:36", "we didn't have all you know minimum wage", "13:38", "or any of these any of these laws", "13:39", "we had a very very tiny government and", "13:41", "because government was tiny", "13:43", "the economy got very big we had all", "13:45", "kinds of freedom", "13:46", "uh and because we were free we were very", "13:48", "productive and", "13:49", "the living standards were rising and we", "13:51", "were eradicating poverty we were making", "13:53", "all kinds of strides", "13:55", "uh the greatest economy in the history", "13:57", "of the world", "13:58", "was produced from the freest people in", "14:00", "the history of the world which was the", "14:01", "united states", "14:03", "well trump wanted to make america great", "14:04", "again the only way to do that", "14:06", "would be to shrink government cut", "14:08", "government spending and free up all", "14:09",

every single", "14:19", "program", "14:20", "has its own constituency that benefits", "14:22", "from it", "14:23", "and so once you once you're there you", "14:25", "can't cut anything", "14:27",

"14:34", "when he when he got into office became a", "14:36", "politician", "14:37", "or maybe he was one when he ran for", "14:39", "office but", "14:40", "he was more concerned about getting",

really what the minimum wage law is", "87:06", "is it makes it illegal for you to work", "87:09", "unless you have enough a certain amount", "87:10", "of productivity so if the minimum wage", "87:12",

we had a depression in 1920", "99:40", "that nobody knows about because it ended", "99:42", "so quickly", "99:43", "because the government did nothing the", "99:45", "reason we had a great depression in the", "99:46", "30s", "99:47", "was because hervert hoover did the same", "99:49", "type of stuff that trump is doing", "99:51", "herbert hoover was the first big", "99:53", "interventionist president", "99:55", "that started spending money to prime the", "99:57", "pump to try to make it better hey we", "99:59", "can't just sit back and allow people to", "100:01", "lose their jobs", "100:02", "and so hoover intervened in the economy", "100:05", "and", "100:05", "helped create the great depression and", "100:07", "then roosevelt came in", "100:09", "and just expanded on hoover's failed", "100:11", "programs and the great depression", "100:13", "spanned the entire decade of the 1930s", "100:16", "we didn't get out of the depression", "100:17", "until 1945", "100:18", "when we

the sequel is about", "100:34", "to come out", "100:35", "which is about the next crash which is", "100:38", "the one that's coming", "100:39", "right and that it's coming soon and and", "100:41", "because of what we just did", "100:44", "after covert 19 uh and the mood that", "100:47", "we're in right now i mean i am so", "100:49", "terrified", "100:50", "of what's coming in this country i mean", "100:53", "that the popularity of socialism", "100:56", "has risen so dramatically because we", "100:58", "have discredited capitalism", "101:00", "by preaching it by not and not", "101:02",

in this country and i'm very", "101:11", "sympathetic", "101:12", "with people on the left who point out", "101:14", "some real problems", "101:15", "now racism isn't one of them let's", "101:17",

real", "101:25", "and i want those problems solved but i", "101:28", "understand", "101:29", "that the solutions that everybody has", "101:31", "we're going to make them much worse", "101:33", "and the way we're going to finance it by", "101:35", "printing money", "101:36", "see we can pretend that we're going to", "101:38", "tax the rich that's not going to work", "101:40", "you know we've tried to tax the rich", "101:42", "before in fact", "101:43", "people don't know this the only reason", "101:45", "we have an income tax", "101:47", "is because we were going to tax the rich", "101:49", "in 1913. that's the only reason", "101:51", "and the government told the public if we", "101:53", "have an income tax on rockefeller and", "101:55", "carnegie and vanderbilt", "101:56", "and it was only going to be like two", "101:57", "percent tiny little little teeny tax", "102:00", "the government said we'll we'll", "102:01", "eliminate tariffs that's why we had an", "102:04",

"102:12", "paid tariffs", "102:13", "i mean donald trump is trying to pretend", "102:15", "that the chinese pay his tariffs", "102:16", "they don't americans pay every tariff", "102:19", "that trump has imposed their attacks on", "102:21", "americans that's what they are", "102:22", "and so what hoover said uh or not hoover", "102:26", "yep um what woodrow wilson said", "102:29", "was hey let's tax the rich with an", "102:32", "income tax and we can eliminate these", "102:34", "tariffs that the average people are", "102:35", "paying", "102:35", "and we made that deal but now", "102:38",

government sub", "126:49", "subsidizing that because if governors", "126:53", "what happens is so your car company", "126:55", "doesn't actually keep the loan", "126:57", "so it doesn't give a damn whether or not", "126:58", "you actually can repay it", "127:00", "so it it it it loans you the money right", "127:03", "and now it has this loan", "127:04", "and it sells it the government buys it",

you're", "127:53", "talking about", "127:54", "yeah well the reason that this is", "127:56", "possible is because the company", "127:59", "takes that loan and sells it", "128:02", "on the secondary

this much or that much then the", "143:39", "government itself becomes a business", "143:41", "and the problem is it needs to verify or", "143:43", "justify its own existence", "143:45", "by creating
