the way I", "23:42", "look at it but well you know that was", "23:44", "designed to sort of placate people well", "23:46", "that's all games are designed to be a", "23:48", "diminishing aspect of war but American", "23:50", "football in particular we actually", "23:51", "literally like systematically designed", "23:53", "like we know the time that it happened", "23:55", "there's a whole Radiolab

all the white kids up", "24:07", "that's some brutal ass games the natives", "24:09", "did not really shit did they eat their", "24:12", "hearts I don't know what the problem was", "24:14", "but it was an issue it was an issue it's", "24:19", "I would I would have loved you know had", "24:21", "Steve Rinella on Reese", "24:22", "he was talking about the guys who killed", "24:25", "Custer and Little Bighorn and one of", "24:27", "these guys was just this massive guy was", "24:29", "in a mall that they called them Gul Gul", "24:31", "and he went on to I think I read that", "24:34", "book while the company was a Conan book", "24:37", "writer called a conqueror yeah right but", "24:41", "this guy was apparently just massive and", "24:44", "I mean I would have loved to like seeing", "24:46", "that with my own eyes like what it looks", "24:49", "like to be like a direct lineage of", "24:51", "warrior culture like if that guy was", "24:54", "living in the 1800s", "24:55", "like he is directly from the original", "24:59", "Native Americans that came here from", "25:01", "Siberia you know whatever thousands and", "25:04", "thousands of years ago that would be", "25:05", "something fuck yeah chief Seattle which", "25:08", "my fucking phone don't work fuck it he", "25:11", "had some quote about being at a football", "25:12", "game at the University of Washington he", "25:14", "was and I can't for the life of me", "25:16", "remember exactly how it goes but it was", "25:18", "just like oh it's not a lot of white men", "25:20", "fight each other today I don't know why", "25:22", "the hell you guys are into this but", "25:23", "whatever yeah they didn't really have", "25:27", "like like that kind of a game there's", "25:30", "something uniquely brutal about American", "25:32", "football there is but when I look at", "25:34", "rugby I'm like okay that to me seems", "25:36", "more realistic it is more realistic I", "25:39", "think in some ways it's even it's more", "25:43", "brutal in some and less than others like", "25:45", "I said like MMA versus maybe kickboxing", "25:47", "yeah well and the thing is that one of", "25:49", "my organs with the rugby kids is like", "25:50", "dude you you don't get hit as hard as", "25:52", "you do in American football as you're", "25:54", "doing here in rugby you just you're not", "25:56", "right Plus the athletes are smaller and", "26:00", "you know go do a kick off guys they talk", "26:04", "about fucking insane but what do you", "26:05", "think would happen it's like what if by", "26:07", "some crazy reason people decided hey", "26:10", "look we're gonna no longer do American", "26:12", "football we're gonna do rugby right", "26:15", "which is open lake I don't totally", "26:18", "understand the difference between the", "26:19", "two of them I would have to watch a few", "26:20", "games I guess but those guys who", "26:23", "dominating football wouldn't you think", "26:24", "there would be the guys who dominate in", "26:26", "rugby yeah I do everybody would just get", "26:28", "bigger and faster and stronger yeah we'd", "26:30", "be just like American level football", "26:31", "players pretty much because the the", "26:36", "and that everybody would switch over to", "26:37", "rugby that means all these rugby teams", "26:39", "and the league and all that would then", "26:41", "be the ones with all the big merchandise", "26:43", "deals and the TV deals and all that all", "26:44", "the money would funnel into it and", "26:46", "therefore the potential prosperity of it", "26:49", "would drive the interest for people to", "26:51", "try and apply their wares at being not", "26:54", "only a part of that hero myth that would", "26:56", "come with being a champion football team", "27:00", "player you know our rugby team player", "27:02", "but also with the hero myth of just", "27:06", "being a part of that within you know", "27:09", "your normal society or of this your", "27:10", "elite exceptional exceptional status", "27:14", "this thing that stands alone that it", "27:15", "seems a bit foreign to your normal", "27:18", "person but also the money and the", "27:20", "success that comes from that kind of", "27:23", "notoriety and the doors that it opens in", "27:25", "terms of you know to use a overused word", "27:29", "the privilege of being at that level at", "27:32", "within that inner circle of exceptional", "27:36", "or seen as exceptional people anyways do", "27:39", "you think what's the short drive it", "27:40", "what's this you've had a long career in", "27:43", "MMA when a long successful career but", "27:45", "it's very rare yeah it's very rare for", "27:47", "someone to be operating the same level", "27:48", "you're seven years is like the cutoff", "27:51", "like when she's about seven everything", "27:53", "starts to just rapidly decline like you", "27:55", "just fall to shit do you think it's an", "27:57", "injury thing is it a training thing is", "28:00", "it just a life thing they didn't they", "28:02", "didn't or at least they weren't able to", "28:04", "single out any particular factor in in", "28:07", "general but you know there was a lot of", "28:09", "theories as to why that might be but", "28:12", "they were able to track professional", "28:15", "fighters careers over length of time I", "28:18", "think they had some metro do the study I", "28:20", "don't remember but it's on the it's on", "28:22", "the internet it they I do believe that", "28:26", "they accounted they were able to account", "28:27", "for number of fights - and send way that", "28:30", "against that metric and see how that may", "28:31", "influence things but seven years was", "28:34", "this magic number like six seven years", "28:36", "and once you start going over seven", "28:38", "years you're your success your", "28:41", "percentage of success started just", "28:42", "crumbling like it was dramatic about how", "28:45", "a guy would be like thirteen and three", "28:47", "and he'd get to seven years and all of a", "28:49", "sudden it's like thirteen", "28:50", "6:13 7:13 he just starts losing just", "28:52", "about everything hmm yeah", "28:55", "BJ pens good example that right you know", "28:57", "like there's certain there's a certain", "28:58", "drop-off where the person just looks", "29:01", "totally different well and and you know", "29:03", "we could honestly look it would be we", "29:06", "would have to isolate a lot of different", "29:07", "factors to figure out any one particular", "29:09", "thing but there's so many elements that", "29:12", "go into being a professional fighter and", "29:13", "being successful at that and so for", "29:15", "let's say we'll take BJ you know maybe", "29:17", "it is physicality maybe he's lost a", "29:20", "little bit of a step his reactions are a", "29:21", "little slower through any number of", "29:24", "reasons why maybe his his strength has", "29:27", "diminished maybe slightly or as", "29:29", "flexibility maybe certain physical", "29:30", "elements regardless of injury or not", "29:33", "have diminished enough that and that", "29:36", "where they used to be it was an edge", "29:38", "where it is now is is evened out or is", "29:41", "or is below what is necessary for him", "29:44", "and how he fights to be successful maybe", "29:47", "could be beyond physical deterioration", "29:50", "maybe it's just mental evasion yeah", "29:53", "exactly so maybe he's just not as", "29:55", "motivated to push in the same ways that", "29:57", "he was or maybe he's not able to", "29:59", "I don't know recognize things that he", "30:03", "was five years ago six years ago and", "30:06", "seeing those opportunities and being", "30:08", "able to react on them quicker there's a", "30:11", "number of things and especially when it", "30:14", "comes to mental now now you're getting", "30:15", "into such a subjective area that you", "30:19", "know go pull that apart yeah that's a", "30:21", "really good point the mental aspect is a", "30:23", "really good point because who knows the", "30:26", "only only the person that's competing", "30:27", "those really never have any idea how", "30:29", "what's going on inside a person's head I", "30:31", "mean for me I decided to take a break", "30:33", "after my arlovski fight and that was", "30:36", "somewhat physically based but most of it", "30:38", "was mental i I just didn't I had no", "30:42", "interest to go into any kind of training", "30:44", "camp to put myself through all that", "30:46", "again to then to fight again you know", "30:49", "it's just for one when you start off", "30:51", "fighting and what those goals are to as", "30:55", "you get further in and further in and", "30:57", "further in and you know getting it", "30:58", "twenty years of being a professional", "31:00", "fighter and being a top ten heavyweight", "31:03", "and arguably in top five most of the", "31:06", "time for shit 16 of them something like", "31:11", "that and high-level competition yeah and", "31:14", "it's just and youngest-ever UFC", "31:17", "heavyweight champion that's right I was", "31:19", "that son-of-a-bitch John Jones came and", "31:22", "beat me out by a few months that", "31:24", "talented bastard the youngest ever yeah", "31:27", "just heavyweight champion instead of the", "31:28", "youngest ever UFC champion but it's it", "31:33", "got to a point where it's just like well", "31:35", "you know my reasons for fighting are", "31:37", "essentially still the same but oh I", "31:40", "don't have the same motivation to go out", "31:42", "there and be like oh I'm gonna conquer", "31:43", "the whole world I'm fine I could beat", "31:45", "that guy could be that I know I could", "31:46", "beat guys like it doesn't I don't I'm", "31:49", "not trying to prove it to myself anymore", "31:50", "you know but that fire that wants to", "31:54", "fight still exists I'm just like well", "31:56", "you know what I'm gonna take some time", "31:57", "to work on some of the other stuff that", "31:59", "is gonna be more of my life after this", "32:02", "because fighting is going to end sooner", "32:05", "then this stuff is how old you know 39", "32:08", "now when you think about do you have", "32:10", "like a number in your head like when I", "32:12", "hit 42 no no no I don't have anything", "32:14", "set like that I just figure that if I'm", "32:16", "being honest with myself and self-aware", "32:19", "that I'll know when that time has come", "32:22", "when that that moment is is getting to", "32:25", "that that edge where if you keep going", "32:29", "it's gonna fucking it's gonna go", "32:31", "downhill versus okay you've got right to", "32:34", "that point call it fucking good move on", "32:37", "and there's still athletic windows open", "32:40", "to me with grappling and maybe a few", "32:42", "other in professional wrestling but", "32:45", "fighting is gonna be a much shorter", "32:48", "window in the fact that I got 20 years", "32:50", "out of it or however long that I take", "32:52", "this to is gonna be pretty phenomenal", "32:55", "yeah it's pretty incredible are you", "32:57", "thinking about doing some more grappling", "32:58", "yeah yeah I mean I've been approached by", "33:00", "a few things but either dollar-wise just", "33:04", "really hasn't made sense or mainly", "33:06", "that's just it and it's I feel like it's", "33:10", "just one thing that people have to", "33:12", "figure out is super popular and get it", "33:13", "on tell or super exciting rather than", "33:15", "get it on television somebody watch like", "33:17", "your match with", "33:17", "Lister you know you're the first

a", "123:03", "kick this way or kick that way or you", "123:05", "know there's always a way to make", "123:06", "something work you know maybe there are", "123:08", "some techniques that are more",

terms", "123:30", "of how you mentally", "123:32", "to fight how to control your nerves or", "123:34", "how to over look at your writing this", "123:37", "outlook as a book yeah I do I think", "123:40", "about writing I think about writing I", "123:42", "think in terms of fighting I think about", "123:43", "writing in terms of philosophy I think", "123:45", "about maybe doing speaking engagement", "123:48", "stuff like that you know talking about", "123:49", "if you sat down and came up with like", "123:51", "sort of a comprehensive step-by-step for", "123:53", "young fighters they'll be like super", "123:54", "value maybe I don't know I guess if you", "123:57", "if you come at work sure you could do", "123:59", "that and which of course is going to be", "124:03", "just like you said framework yeah give", "124:05", "them tools to fall back on if they're in", "124:07", "a certain situation this is something", "124:09", "you can call on this is something you", "124:10", "can think about if you find yourself", "124:12", "stuck this is the mindset instead of", "124:14", "just swimming out there sure freaking", "124:16", "out treading water and trying to figure", "124:17", "out how long and you do it for have a", "124:19", "very specific mindset that you adopt or", "124:21", "that you take on when you're in a bad", "124:23", "spot sure and and a lot of drills and", "124:27", "things that I'll create for fighters are", "124:29", "based on creating comforts and and", "124:33", "familiarity to where things get to a", "124:36", "point where you're not thinking about it", "124:39", "anymore but you're so comfortable and in", "124:41", "that moment in that space that you can", "124:43", "react and act easily the most easily as", "124:47", "possible and also once you end up in a", "124:49", "position that is even that is a negative", "124:53", "to you that is detrimental how to then", "124:56", "work your way through it and still do so", "124:58", "with comfort like I loved watching Liz", "125:01", "Carmouche on Rhonda's back because", "125:02", "Rhonda states so so calm that that's how", "125:07", "she was able to work her way through it", "125:09", "fight that arm off her head keep in good", "125:12", "position and eventually work her way out", "125:14", "of it instead of seizing up and possibly", "125:18", "you know locking in place and then Liz", "125:21", "being able to finish that face lock or", "125:23", "that choke what did you think about that", "125:24", "Kevin leaked he has a fight I didn't", "125:26", "watch it you didn't watch it now how", "125:28", "dare you I I know I'm a fighter that", "125:31", "doesn't really watch fight he's a crazy", "125:32", "ending so I heard yeah Kevin Lee took PS", "125:36", "his back which is casas thing right yeah", "125:38", "and he took his back sunk the choke in", "125:41", "guess a fought her off he went palm to", "125:43", "palm", "125:44", "chiesa like was trying to gut it out he", "125:47", "says and Mario Yamasaki steps in and", "125:50", "stops it before he taps I wouldn't done", "125:53", "that no one does that", "125:55", "especially do a choke it's one thing if", "125:57", "a guy's arm is snapped and you see it", "125:59", "broken Brennan and you call the fight", "126:01", "right but this is not that this is any", "126:03", "same that he thought he went out it's", "126:05", "just a hundred percent poor officiating", "126:08", "I mean I haven't certain seen any", "126:09", "tournament from anybody on the rights", "126:11", "imeem on in terms of people that are", "126:14", "either work for the UFC trainers", "126:16", "fighters even jujitsu athletes yeah", "126:18", "everybody's gotta let him go out it's a", "126:20", "great it's not a bad thing but people", "126:25", "don't know it's not you don't get it's", "126:27", "not like getting knocked out yeah he", "126:28", "could have been shut off being with two", "126:30", "chicks yeah it doesn't it doesn't hurt", "126:32", "you is my point for people who don't", "126:33", "understand what we're advocating it's", "126:35", "not like let a guy get knocked out well", "126:37", "we get knocked out it's not good but", "126:38", "when you get choked out it's almost", "126:40", "nothing", "126:40", "it literally is almost nothing pretty", "126:42", "much it's it tells you you're next gonna", "126:44", "be sore yeah for sure yeah I know Mario", "126:50", "I've known him for a long time and it's", "126:52", "made a mistake I and that's the thing", "126:54", "you know referees are human they all", "126:56", "looked it's a fuckin very hard job", "126:59", "he probably thought chiesa went out he", "127:00", "thought he saw here we can get take a", "127:02", "look at it here let's let play the whole", "127:04", "thing back from the beginning Jimmy so", "127:06", "you can see that I can I get ok just ok", "127:07", "good from there okay so he's get it yeah", "127:09", "he locks it on the neck sure he's got", "127:11", "the bloody strike no kisses fighting it", "127:13", "peels it off and then Kevin locks the", "127:15", "body tried trial triangle down tighter I", "127:18", "see it yeah yeah gets that palm to palm", "127:20", "and look at this see he's fighting it", "127:22", "off and look he's not out at all I", "127:25", "didn't tap what the fuck I didn't tap I", "127:27", "think that's a bullshit stoppage and", "127:29", "it's not much you know look Mario made a", "127:31", "mistake but it's a bullshit stoppage", "127:33", "100% I can't even imagine anybody", "127:36", "defending that stoppage there's no", "127:38", "reason well solve it because if you", "127:42", "don't defend your that making that", "127:44", "stoppage he's crazy", "127:45", "well understand that but but people", "127:48", "don't want to didn't want to didn't want", "127:51", "to accept any blame swatching blame me", "127:53", "he's in he's gotten it out yeah he's", "127:55", "gotten it out man look people don't", "127:57", "realize", "127:57", "takes a lot of effort to squeeze that", "127:59", "pom-pom particularly using a lot of", "128:01", "muscle there's not a whole lot of it's", "128:03", "not the same kind of leverage that you", "128:05", "get when you do these hands kind of you", "128:09", "know in the air but I mean you can still", "128:11", "grab you could touch the guy's arm yeah", "128:13", "yeah", "128:14", "and they're they're stiff yeah he's", "128:15", "still resisting and you'd you don't have", "128:17", "to it's not like strikes well you have", "128:19", "to have your hands up covering yourself", "128:21", "like to resist it he can resist by just", "128:24", "really flexing his neck it's not smart", "128:26", "and tyron woodley had the best", "128:27", "commentary on this honestly he was on", "128:30", "that a UFC panel show here and he's like", "128:32", "look you shouldn't he goes you shouldn't", "128:35", "be in that position in the first place", "128:36", "you shouldn't be defending it like that", "128:38", "with your hands like that and you", "128:39", "shouldn't have let that guy get his arm", "128:42", "under your chin like that all those", "128:43", "things are bad technique and he's dead", "128:45", "right yeah he's dead right the whole", "128:47", "thing is kind of crazy I mean yeah I", "128:50", "mean it was he took a beating before", "128:52", "that this is one of the things you don't", "128:53", "get in the context of this as he was", "128:55", "getting shellacked yes cuz Kevin Lee had", "128:57", "his back and while he had his back see", "128:59", "if he can find that I mean I can see", "129:01", "that he's cut oh he's been bleeding he's", "129:03", "back and he was beating the fuck out of", "129:05", "him from behind with his back just bang", "129:07", "bang bang while he's back riding him", "129:10", "he'd beat the shit out of him before", "129:12", "that so he's probably stunned and you", "129:14", "know I'm also of the sort that sees guys", "129:17", "that are getting hit and the four-point", "129:19", "position turtle position you know guys", "129:20", "are swinging on them and they've got", "129:23", "their arms up and they're covered often", "129:25", "a lot of times I just keep let it go", "129:26", "okay you're not getting through but", "129:28", "wrestle see like oh it looks bad we're", "129:30", "stopping it's like but he's not really", "129:31", "getting hit I agree with you 100% I", "129:33", "think there's been many fights where", "129:35", "fights were stopped quick when a guy was", "129:37", "covered up where there's nothing else", "129:38", "you could do cover up what else is he", "129:40", "gonna do yeah guys swinging on him but", "129:42", "he can't can't land a successful so the", "129:44", "only reason that guy is flurrying so", "129:45", "hard really I mean well not the only but", "129:48", "the main reason is probably because he", "129:49", "thinks the reps gonna stop it exactly on", "129:51", "that he wouldn't put that kind of effort", "129:52", "into it unless he's just completely", "129:54", "losing his shit mean like he's not", "129:57", "thinking about it which could come back", "129:59", "to haunt him like I've seen a lot of", "130:00", "times the old old school fights guys", "130:03", "even in mouth just try unload on a guy", "130:05", "and the guy survives it reverses it and", "130:08", "eventually he gets his and it's done you", "130:11", "know", "130:11", "Arwen Brock Lesnar yeah perfect example", "130:13", "yeah Shane Carwin beat the fucking shit", "130:16", "out of Brock Lesnar for a full round got", "130:18", "on top of them full mount yep dropping", "130:20", "bombs on them yeah", "130:21", "somehow or another Brock Lesnar survives", "130:23", "take Shane down the SAC around submit", "130:25", "some quick yep it happens you gotta let", "130:28", "fights play out but I think in that", "130:30", "situation it's easy there's no argument", "130:33", "for stopping the fight because it's not", "130:35", "like strikes like there could be an", "130:37", "argument where Brock Lesnar is on the", "130:39", "bottom and he's not moving enough and", "130:41", "maybe some people a little bit more", "130:42", "cautious might stop that fight but", "130:44", "there's no argument to stop that I don't", "130:46", "think that the fight should have been", "130:47", "stopped yes it needs to do a better job", "130:50", "of not letting guys get under his chin", "130:52", "yeah what do you do about that if you're", "130:54", "the commissioner if you're the king of", "130:55", "the world", "130:56", "do your commissioner you I don't know I", "131:02", "kind of feel like you have to keep him", "131:04", "given the win it's hard to reverse up", "131:06", "like that it's a mistake that the", "131:08", "referee fucked up for sure he stopped", "131:09", "the fight but he
