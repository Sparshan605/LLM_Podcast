traditional", "03:13", "people you know group that has ever been", "03:15", "identified that voluntarily followed a", "03:17", "vegan or even vegetarian diet that I", "03:20", "know of so that should

know we came down out", "03:41", "of the trees and we developed the", "03:43", "development of tools that could crack", "03:45", "bones to give us access to the marrow", "03:47", "which is super nutrient dense or to", "03:49", "slice meat which allowed us to be able", "03:51", "to digest the meat more quickly number", "03:54", "one and then to the development of fire", "03:56", "which allowed us to cook meat and", "03:58", "cooking makes the nutrients and meat", "04:00", "more bioavailable allowed us to spend", "04:03", "less time foraging for food", "04:05", "so most large primates like

eat a boatload of", "04:19", "stuff and just sit there and chew on the", "04:21", "plants all day to get enough nutrients", "04:23", "and", "04:24", "and so this evolutionary theory is that", "04:27",

could then", "04:37", "spend a lot less of our time going", "04:40", "around getting food which allowed us and", "04:42", "then develop bigger brains and you know", "04:44", "become human and have this conversation", "04:46", "where we're talking about Vidia", "04:48", "vegetarian and vegan diets yeah it is", "04:51", "kind of interesting and it's also", "04:53", "important to differentiate

he's", "07:50", "he's a great guy I've met him a couple", "07:52", "of times and so certainly it works for", "07:57", "some people but there are a lot of", "07:58", "factors that determine whether it's", "08:00", "going to work so one is is how well you", "08:02", "do it two is you know whether you know", "08:06", "what you're doing with supplementation", "08:07", "in terms of getting the necessary", "08:08", "nutrients three is genetics", "08:11", "so let me there are genetic differences", "08:15", "that determine how well we convert", "08:17", "precursor nutrients into the nutrients", "08:20", "that we actually need and let me give", "08:21", "three examples to make this more real so", "08:23", "one is epa and DHA these are these", "08:26", "long-chain omega-3 fats that we've heard", "08:28", "so much about that are crucial for brain", "08:30", "function and cardiovascular function etc", "08:32", "and we you primarily you get them by", "08:35", "eating fish there are no sources of", "08:37", "those in a plant-based diet", "08:40", "except for algae but an algae is not", "08:44", "that bioavailable right no and how many", "08:46", "people do you know that eat algae", "08:48", "I don't know every weekend with that you", "08:51", "can is that famous green supplementation", "08:54", "stuff but very few people are eating it", "08:57", "so but you but there is something called", "09:00", "alpha-linolenic acid which is in walnuts", "09:03", "and flaxseed that's an omega-3 plant fat", "09:06", "and and humans in theory can convert", "09:08", "some of that

into EPA and even less to DHA", "09:21", "like two to five percent so you have to", "09:23", "be chugging tablespoons of flax oil in", "09:26", "order to get as much BPA or DHEA that", "09:29", "you would get from eating just a little", "09:30", "bit of fish and that's if everything is", "09:32", "going well because if you have", "09:34", "deficiency of any nutrients that are", "09:36", "involved in the enzymatic conversion of", "09:38", "those plant-based fats into the", "09:40", "long-chain fats then you won't make", "09:42", "those conversions at that optimal rate", "09:44", "it'll be even less and ironically many", "09:46", "of those nutrients and nutrients that", "09:48", "are not well represented in a vegan or", "09:50", "vegetarian diet so that's one example", "09:53", "another would be vitamin k2 which is a", "09:56", "different form of vitamin K that's", "09:58", "recently been discovered and it's really", "10:01", "important for cardiovascular and bone", "10:03", "health it basically puts make sure that", "10:06", "calcium gets in our bones and our teeth", "10:07", "and our hard tissues where it belongs", "10:09", "and keeps it out of the soft tissues", "10:11", "like our arteries where calcium would", "10:13", "make our arteries hard and increase the", "10:15", "risk of a heart attack", "10:16", "so k2 is only really in animal foods", "10:20", "with the exception of some fermented", "10:22", "foods like natto which is a Japanese", "10:25", "fermented soybean product that most", "10:28", "people cannot stand it's it's a strong", "10:31", "taste not very many people are eating it", "10:32", "here to fear and and sauerkraut and", "10:36", "kimchi have kk2 in it I say kaffir I've", "10:39", "been saying kefir my whole life that's", "10:41", "how I've never heard it that's how they", "10:43", "say it where the fear is from well I fed", "10:46", "every game every other person I've ever", "10:48", "met says kefir so don't worry about okay", "10:50", "if I'm saying kefir from now on are you", "10:52", "sure", "10:53", "here you'll be in the select few yes you", "11:01", "can feel superior no look can I stop you", "11:03", "real quick just because we're gonna I", "11:05", "want to get a little bit onto this track", "11:08", "of what you were describing about fish", "11:10", "oil and that inversion and the", "11:13", "difference between flaxseed oil what", "11:15", "what can vegans take in order to sort of", "11:18", "I recommend that vegans take microalgae", "11:21", "because it has preformed DHA in it so", "11:24", "you bypass that whole conversion issue I", "11:27", "mean if they do take microalgae is that", "11:29", "sufficient or how much difference is", "11:31", "that then eating fish", "11:33", "well it's quite different because fish", "11:35", "have a lot of other nutrients aside from", "11:37", "epa and DHA so team they have selenium", "11:41", "they have a lot of other bioavailable", "11:43", "nutrients but but and the other", "11:45", "disadvantage is you have to take a boat", "11:47", "load of algae i think so different", "11:54", "products have different amounts but you", "11:57", "know i think you'd have to take six to", "11:59", "nine caps capsules a day of average", "12:03", "algae supplement in order to meet your", "12:05", "DHA that's not bad be done it could it's", "12:09", "absolutely possible but that would be a", "12:11", "good way to be healthy with the vegan", "12:13", "diet that would be one way to address", "12:15", "the shortcoming of no of lack of DHA on", "12:19", "the vegan diet there are other", "12:20", "shortcomings other nutrients like b12", "12:22", "which aren't you that's a big issue and", "12:26", "and vegans need to be supplementing with", "12:28", "that there's a myth out there that there", "12:31", "are some plant sources of b12 like", "12:33", "seaweed and spirit like spirulina and", "12:36", "nutritional yeast but those actually", "12:38", "contain kind of phony forms of b12 that", "12:41", "can block the absorption of true b12", "12:45", "which is only found in animal products", "12:47", "or supplements so a b12 supplement would", "12:51", "be really important that's what's the", "12:52", "source of a b12 supplement they it's", "12:57", "synthetic it's synthetic I think but", "13:00", "they just there's three forms of b12", "13:02", "there's there's hydroxocobalamin and", "13:05", "methyl cobalamin", "13:06", "or four forms that you can supplement", "13:08", "with psionic apollomon and", "13:10", "adenosylcobalamin and psionic cobalamin", "13:12", "is a synthetic form and then the other", "13:15", "ones are natural forms of b12 that you", "13:17", "would encounter in food so people can", "13:20", "supplement with any of those the the", "13:22", "natural forms are better to supplement", "13:24", "with because they're more bioavailable", "13:26", "but definitely if a vegan I would", "13:29", "recommend supplementing with b12 because", "13:31", "there aren't any sources of it in the", "13:33", "diet and studies have shown that 68% of", "13:36", "vegetarians are deficient and b12 83% of", "13:39", "vegans are versus just 5% of omnivores", "13:42", "Wow so it's a big difference we're not", "13:45", "you know and that's a factor in in many", "13:47", "different issues right it's a factor in", "13:49", "the production of muscle all production", "13:52", "of all red blood cells depends on b12", "13:55", "and folate and so I mean that's pretty", "13:57", "fundamental right yeah and then the", "13:59", "myelin sheath

person to ask about that because", "14:47", "I'm I'm not a vegan myself I was a", "14:50", "macrobiotic vegan at one point what does", "14:52", "that mean what's the difference that's", "14:53", "deep

to health what", "15:19", "did you take from", "15:20", "I was in Indonesia I mentioned earlier I", "15:23", "traveled around the world and I was", "15:25", "surfing and I got the classic tropical",

to take to get rid of", "15:56", "the parasites after that it just wreaked", "15:58", "havoc on my gut and it took me basically", "16:00", "ten years to to recover ten years it was", "16:06", "like

it's crazy so you", "16:36", "know I took way more antibiotics than I", "16:38", "would have done in retrospect because", "16:41", "that's what the doctors were prescribing", "16:42", "and saying look you've got these", "16:44", "parasites we've got to get rid of them", "16:45", "this is how you do it and you know and I", "16:48", "think the antibiotics if could have been", "16:50", "like the

"21:50", "question it's it used to be you know the", "21:52", "the kind of consensus was that omega", "21:55", "sixes would be higher and omega threes", "21:57", "would be lower but it actually looks", "21:59", "like mega six is constant and i'm", "22:01", "three is higher the omega-3 is higher", "22:03", "because the grass probably has more", "22:06", "alpha linolenic acid which is the",

k1", "22:26", "is what's converted into k2 cows are", "22:29", "experts doing that they're really good", "22:31", "at it", "22:31", "humans not so much so when we eat the", "22:34", "animal the

"23:21", "hands and his skin would turn orange", "23:22", "yeah so he probably wasn't good at", "23:24", "converting beta-carotene into retinol", "23:26", "because we should be able to do that but", "23:28", "some people can't but isn't just the", "23:30", "mass quantities I mean it could be too", "23:33", "but if retinol is only really present in", "23:37", "organ meats and pasture-raised fats it's", "23:41", "not even really in muscle meats like you", "23:42", "know lean ground beef or chicken broth", "23:45", "yeah boneless chicken breasts or so in", "23:48", "order to get retinol we need to consume", "23:50", "these pasture-raised fats or we need to", "23:52", "consume organ meats and as you pointed", "23:54", "out we're gonna meats have really fallen", "23:55", "out of favor in the US and and this is", "23:58", "only recent like I bet you our", "24:00", "grandparents ate a lot more organ meat", "24:02", "than we eat still in some you know many", "24:04", "parts of the world they still eat organ", "24:06", "meats more dry we do yeah", "24:08", "liver and onions is a very famous dish", "24:10", "yeah yeah he's hard and", "24:12", "you'll see like within the paleo primal", "24:16", "kind of world the organ meats are making", "24:18", "a comeback because we understand now", "24:20", "with the nutrient density of these foods", "24:22", "is and there's less now even in the", "24:24", "mainstream world there's less of a solid", "24:27", "argument that can be made about least", "24:29", "having cholesterol or you know high", "24:31", "levels of saturated fat that would", "24:33", "prevent us from eating them now what", "24:34", "would be the difference in terms of the", "24:36", "nutritional density of mollusks versus", "24:39", "organ meat so if you were trying to if", "24:41", "you have a vegetarian or a vegan who's", "24:43", "on the fence and you know you made these", "24:46", "arguments that are very rational and", "24:47", "logical and you said look what mollusks", "24:49", "are essentially a very very primitive", "24:52", "form of life that doesn't feel pain and", "24:54", "you could argue that there's more", "24:56", "evidence that some plants feel pain and", "24:58", "plants also have some very intense level", "25:01", "of communication where they're there", "25:03", "there's a really interesting addition of", "25:06", "Radiolab recently where they went into", "25:08", "this where they sort of are trying to", "25:11", "understand the difference between the", "25:14", "not the difference rather but the the", "25:16", "complicated relationship between these", "25:19", "different plants and the mycelium in the", "25:23", "soil and all the different fungus in the", "25:26", "soil that also acts as sort of a", "25:28", "transportation method the various", "25:29", "nutrients and minerals and they're", "25:31", "actually pulling these minerals out of", "25:32", "the rock and they're getting sugars from", "25:34", "the plants and they're exchanging them", "25:35", "from minerals and that there's this", "25:37", "really complex interaction that we have", "25:41", "sort of just looked at and said oh", "25:43", "there's dirt and there's plants in it", "25:44", "but there's a lot going on between these", "25:46", "various life-forms and one of them being", "25:48", "fungus which again is closer to an", "25:51", "animal than it is to a plant but is", "25:54", "imperative for the life of these plants", "25:56", "right and then somehow another they're", "25:58", "actually even sharing resources where if", "26:00", "they find or they're allotting resources", "26:03", "to certain plants that are more", "26:05", "deficient or they're trying to channel", "26:06", "resources to them so there's some form", "26:08", "of communication an exchange here yeah", "26:11", "that's that's intelligence right yeah I", "26:12", "mean Paul Stamets has done amazing work", "26:14", "yes in general yeah I would say that", "26:20", "that's a really good option I mean when", "26:23", "you look at nutrients like specific", "26:25", "nutrients that it goes back and for", "26:26", "between liver and you know organ meats", "26:28", "and shellfish and some some nutrients", "26:30", "organ meats are higher like vitamin A or", "26:34", "iron in other nutrients shellfish are", "26:37", "generally higher like with zinc or", "26:39", "copper but certainly even even shellfish", "26:45", "are higher in almost all of the key", "26:47", "nutrients that we need then a lot of the", "26:50", "plant-based food alternatives that they", "26:52", "would be choosing from and so if a vegan", "26:55", "was willing to eat mollusks I would say", "26:57", "that that would be a great idea and the", "26:59", "benefit there is you don't need to eat a", "27:01", "lot like three ounces a single serving", "27:04", "can meet your copper requirement for the", "27:07", "entire week oh wow this one time same", "27:13", "with iron I think if I'm going off the", "27:14", "top of my head I'll iron and zinc", "27:16", "you can nearly meet your entire weekly", "27:18", "requirement so it's not like you have to", "27:21", "eat a ton of these things you know you", "27:22", "have a serving of clams once a week and", "27:25", "you have a serving of oysters once a", "27:26", "week you know on top of and getting as", "27:30", "much nutrient density as you can that", "27:33", "should do that's b12 that's iron that", "27:36", "sink that's copper EPA and DHA the", "27:39", "long-chain omega-3 fats are in these in", "27:42", "these mollusks because as well in it", "27:45", "they're typically low on the toxicity", "27:48", "scale - they're not they don't turn out", "27:51", "a lot of mercury they don't", "27:52",

toxins is there", "28:01", "any benefit to eating them cooked versus", "28:03", "raw one way or the other well you know", "28:06", "there's out there is the chance of", "28:08", "disease in you know eating raw oysters I", "28:11", "think it's pretty minimal compared to", "28:14", "some other risks but it's it is there", "28:16", "and cooking you know mitigates that", "28:19", "definitely I think in general cooking", "28:22", "makes the nutrients and meat and animal", "28:24", "products more bioavailable rather than", "28:27", "less and that's in vegetables it's it", "28:30", "depends on the vegetable and and the", "28:33", "method of cooking but it's a mix it's", "28:36", "more of a mixed bag but within meats it", "28:37", "generally improves about", "28:40", "so it really is in a lot of ways an", "28:43", "ideological issue where it's sort of", "28:46", "framed that you know you don't want to", "28:48", "contribute to suffering but these things", "28:51", "really don't suffer there yeah but even", "28:54", "there you know as we talked about you're", "28:56", "gonna continue to contribute to", "28:57", "suffering and potentially more if you're", "28:59", "looking on the scale of
