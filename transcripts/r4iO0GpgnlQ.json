some motherfucker", "28:49", "eats a bat you know it's really crazy", "29:02", "man think of this if technology really", "29:05", "did have an effect on the programming of", "29:08", "human beings and

of dream and", "48:49", "sleep well I feel like it's fucking cool", "48:52", "but basically it's like it's form of", "48:55", "Tibetan Buddhism that invites you to", "49:00", "explore the difference between when you", "49:04", "think you're awake and when you're", "49:05", "dreaming and so basically the idea is", "49:08", "there isn't much of a difference there", "49:10", "like right now you're dreaming this", "49:14", "thing you call your human incarnation", "49:16", "it's like it is a dream and you know", "49:20", "like when people are dying they get all", "49:22", "delirious and shit they slide through", "49:25", "time you know like I don't know if you", "49:26", "ever been around a dying person but they", "49:28", "they like suddenly they're back in", "49:31", "Vietnam they're in the 50s", "49:34", "they're in the 30s where however", "49:36", "whatever their lifetime which means that", "49:38", "when you're dying you're gonna like spin", "49:40", "through time - meaning that this could", "49:43", "be you dying right now spinning back", "49:46", "with you but like in a dream so that", "49:50", "when you you know this is the main thing", "49:51", "about it is that when we die according", "49:55", "to this we we sort of spend like 39 days", "49:58", "I think it is in a place called the", "50:00", "Bardo which is essentially like what", "50:05", "it's like to have no body but still have", "50:07", "this like I this basically like your", "50:10", "karma your identity sort of propelling", "50:13", "you through and that that that's how you", "50:15", "like you get your next incarnation so", "50:17", "essentially like that's the what we're", "50:21", "dealing with here is so bizarre and", "50:22", "surreal that it easily could just be a", "50:26", "dream state that one of these vast a", "50:29", "eyes that already exists is having we're", "50:32", "just processors we're just being run", "50:34", "it's like running a simulation of a", "50:37", "pandemic or maybe this is a way that", "50:39", "like an AI gets polished like maybe", "50:42", "we're an AI that's being like polished", "50:45", "and taught through this process of", "50:47", "having a limited

years", "50:57", "eventually we wouldn't have such a", "51:00", "passionate relationship I think with the", "51:02", "world anyone who's gonna it so you need", "51:04", "that to train the thing up so it takes", "51:06", "it seriously you have to put the setting", "51:08", "on mortal then you know then maybe you", "51:10", "just run a series of tests on the thing", "51:12", "you know you start run what is this what", "51:14", "have we made what does it do in a", "51:16", "pandemic and by it I mean the sum total", "51:18", "of all humans which is right now", "51:21", "disconnected it's like a malfunctioning", "51:23", "brain the Sonata you know what I mean", "51:25", "we're not connecting but if we were", "51:27", "being like sort of I don't know how you", "51:29", "put it groomed evolved intentionally", "51:33", "then every single moment in an", "51:35", "individual's life and in a planet the", "51:37", "planets the life of history could be", "51:40", "looked at as a training or an upgrade", "51:42", "this could be an operating system", "51:43", "upgrade this could be what an operating", "51:46", "system upgrade looks like in the", "51:48", "bio-computer that we exist in it looks", "51:50", "like a fucking pandemic and that's", "51:53", "what's happening right now is we're", "51:54", "being like upgraded for some reason even", "51:56", "though it's terrifying and obviously", "51:59", "horrific you know we're being upgraded", "52:01", "and when you anyway the whole point is", "52:05", "man this thing that we're in right now", "52:07", "whether or not there's a god we just I", "52:10", "think an atheist gets to lean into the", "52:13", "idea that when they close their eyes and", "52:14", "breathe their last breath it stops and I", "52:17", "just think that's a big gamble man", "52:19", "that's and I don't mean because you're", "52:20", "go to hell I mean how nice would that be", "52:23", "yeah if it just stopped when more than", "52:26", "likely it's you know the at least in", "52:28", "this Tibetan yoga of dreaming and sleep", "52:30", "more than likely what happens is way", "52:33", "before you actually die when you get", "52:34", "really sick you already start waking up", "52:37", "into your next life you just wait you", "52:40", "just like go through a weird dreamlike", "52:42", "stay called the Bardo where you freak", "52:44", "the fuck out and then you're suddenly", "52:46", "alive and another being completely", "52:49", "oblivious to whatever your past", "52:50", "incarnations were and not to or in right", "52:53", "now so you know I don't know this is a", "52:55", "great time for people to start you know", "52:57", "looking at that in one in preparing for", "53:01", "that we didn't prepare for the fucking", "53:04", "pandemic we didn't prepare some of y'all", "53:06", "did I'm sure but", "53:07", "there's a few Preppers out there", "53:09", "listening oh yeah who's ready I know you", "53:11", "guys did it man", "53:13", "you were right congratulations I've got", "53:16", "fucking hummus and strawberries and some", "53:18", "like and but but I think that like also", "53:21", "preparing for like the authentic", "53:23",

something", "165:00", "that Dana White and Frank Fertitta were", "165:03", "talking about before anyone did it Frank", "165:06", "Fertitta told Dana White he's like why", "165:09", "don't we just have everything shut down", "165:10", "for two weeks just no one go to work no", "165:12", "one do anything two weeks stop the", "165:14", "planes and the way he explained it to me", "165:17", "was like he said pull the band-aid off", "165:18", "of it I'm like that is actually probably", "165:20", "a really good idea well guess what now", "165:22", "that's being forced mandatory forced in", "165:25",

"165:33", "let's nip this fucking thing in the bud", "165:35", "yeah if that was", "165:36", "really done there right it really would", "165:38", "I mean if you could really get that to", "165:39", "be implemented at a scale of 350 million", "165:42", "people amazing but you you could you", "165:44", "definitely would have radically slowed", "165:46", "down the pace we weren't ready we", "165:48", "weren't ready well now we know yeah hope", "165:50", "I hope I hope we learned and I hope it", "165:52", "doesn't morph and I hope it doesn't get", "165:53", "more deadly and I hope you know they can", "165:55", "figure out a way to allocate funds to", "165:57", "get more respirators and you know all", "165:59", "that shit has to be done you can make", "166:01", "your own hand
