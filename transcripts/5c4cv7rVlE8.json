["00:00", "and here we go all right Nick this is", "00:04", "one of the things that scares people", "00:07", "more than anything is the idea that", "00:10", "we're creating something or someone's", "00:12", "gonna create something it's gonna be", "00:13", "smarter than us it's gonna replace us is", "00:16", "that something we should really be", "00:19", "concerned about I presume you're afraid", "00:21", "to babies I'm referring to artificial", "00:26", "intelligence yes well it's the the big", "00:30", "fear and the big hope I think both at", "00:33", "the same time yeah how is it the big", "00:35", "hope well there are a lot of things", "00:38", "wrong with the world that is not pull", "00:39", "this up to your face all the problems we", "00:45", "have most of them could be solved if we", "00:50", "were smarter or if we had somebody on", "00:53", "our side who were a lot smarter with", "00:55", "better technology and so forth also I", "00:59", "think if we want to imagine some really", "01:02", "grand future where humanity or our", "01:05", "descendants when they go out and", "01:08", "colonize the universe I think that's", "01:10", "likely to happen if it's gonna happen at", "01:12", "all after we have super intelligence", "01:15", "that then develops the technology to", "01:17", "make that possible", "01:18", "the real question is whether or not we", "01:20", "would be able to harness this", "01:21", "intelligence or whether it would", "01:23", "dominate yeah that certainly is one", "01:26", "question not the only you could imagine", "01:30", "that we harness it but then use it for", "01:32", "bad purposes as we have a lot of other", "01:35", "technologies through history yes I think", "01:37", "there are really two challenges we need", "01:39", "to meet one one is to make sure we can", "01:41", "align it with human values and then make", "01:44", "sure that we together do something", "01:46", "better with it than fighting worse or", "01:49", "oppressing one another I think well what", "01:51", "I'm worried about more than any things", "01:52", "that human beings are going to become", "01:53", "obsolete that we're going to invent", "01:55", "something that's the next stage of", "01:57", "evolution I'm really concerned with that", "01:59", "I'm really concerned with if we look", "02:01", "back on ancient hominids Australia", "02:04", "Pittacus just

"02:39", "improvement right so so the key would be", "02:41", "I think to find some path forward where", "02:45", "the best in us can continue to exist and", "02:49", "develop to even greater levels and maybe", "02:52", "at the end of that path it looks nothing", "02:55", "like we do now maybe it's not two legged", "02:57", "armed creatures running around with", "02:59", "three pounds of thinking

we are", "03:18", "eventually going to become something", "03:20", "more advanced or at least more", "03:22", "complicated than we are now but what I'm", "03:24", "worried is that biological life

rapid than", "03:52", "anything we could ever even imagine", "03:54", "biologically like if we had a thing that", "03:57", "we'd create if we created instead of", "03:59", "artificial intelligence in

we", "04:29", "would circle will be hit the brakes on", "04:31", "this thing man how how many more", "04:33", "generations before this thing's way", "04:35", "smarter than us", "04:36", "how many more

it's slowing down well", "04:50", "don't I have it like Tyler Cowen and", "04:53", "you're gonna Peter Thiel's sometimes", "04:55", "goes on about the pace of innovation and", "04:59", "not really being what it needs to be", "05:01", "mm-hmm", "05:02", "I mean maybe it was faster in like 1890s", "05:06", "or but but still compared to almost all", "05:11", "of human history it seems like a period", "05:14", "of unprecedented rapid progress right", "05:16", "now", "05:17", "unprecedented I'd say so yeah I mean", "05:19", "except for maybe a couple of decades", "05:21", "hundred years ago when there was a lot", "05:23", "of you know electricity the whole thing", "05:25", "yeah no I agree", "05:27", "I just I'm I don't think it's a concern", "05:32", "because it's more of a curiosity I am", "05:35", "concerned but more I look at it and go", "05:38", "well this is see it seems inevitable", "05:39", "that we're we're going to run into", "05:42", "artificial intelligence but the", "05:44", "questions are so open-ended we really", "05:47", "don't know when we don't really don't", "05:48", "know what form it's gonna take and we", "05:50", "really don't know what it's going to do", "05:53", "to us yeah I see it this not something", "05:56", "that should be avoided", "06:00", "neither something that we should just be", "06:02", "completely gone how about but more like", "06:03", "a kind of gate through which we will", "06:05", "have to pass at some point all paths", "06:08", "that are both possible only two really", "06:10", "great futures I think at some point", "06:12", "involve the development of greater than", "06:14", "human intelligence machine intelligence", "06:16", "and so that our focus should be on", "06:18", "getting our act together as much as we", "06:20", "can in whatever period of time we have", "06:23", "before that", "06:25", "prepare ourselves well I mean that might", "06:28", "involve doing some some research into", "06:29", "various technical questions as how you", "06:31", "build these systems so that we actually", "06:33", "understand what they are doing and they", "06:35", "have some you know intended impact on", "06:38", "the world it might also if we are", "06:39", "to get our act together a little bit", "06:42", "that I don't on the kind of global", "06:44", "political scene a little bit more peace", "06:47", "and love in the world would be good", "06:48", "anymore would be nice so and and then", "06:52", "like refraining from destroying", "06:54", "ourselves through some other means", "06:55", "before we even get a chance to try to", "06:57", "needle our way through this this gate", "07:01", "well that's certainly possible we were", "07:03", "certainly capable of screwing it all up", "07:04", "where is the current state of Technology", "07:07", "now in regards to artificial", "07:09", "intelligence and how far away do you", "07:11", "think we are from AGI well different", "07:15", "different people have different views on", "07:17", "that I think the the truth of the matter", "07:20", "is that it's very hard to have accurate", "07:23", "views about the timelines for these", "07:24", "things that that's you know or still", "07:27", "involve kind of beginning breakthroughs", "07:29", "that have to happen certainly I mean", "07:33", "over the last eight or ten years there", "07:35", "has been a lot of excitement away the", "07:36", "deep learning revolution things that I", "07:40", "mean it used to be that people thought", "07:42", "of a is this kind of autistic savant", "07:45", "really good at logic and counting and", "07:48", "memorizing facts but with no no", "07:52", "intuition and there's this deep learning", "07:54", "evolution and when you begin to do these", "07:56", "deep neural networks do you kind of", "07:59", "solved perception in some sense you can", "08:02", "have computers that can see that that", "08:04", "can hear and that have visual intuition", "08:07", "so so so that that has enabled the whole", "08:10", "wide suite of applications which makes", "08:13", "it commercially valuable which then", "08:15", "drives a lot of investment in it which", "08:17", "you know there's a so there's now quite", "08:20", "a lot of momentum in in machine learning", "08:23", "and trying to kind of stay ahead at that", "08:25", "it's interesting that when we think", "08:27", "about artificial intelligence and", "08:29", "whatever potential form that's going to", "08:31", "take if you look in films like 2001 like", "08:35", "how like open the door Hal you know like", "08:38", "we think of some thing that's", "08:40", "communicating to us like like a person", "08:42", "would and maybe is a little bit colder", "08:45", "and doesn't doesn't share our values and", "08:47", "has a more pragmatic view of life and", "08:51", "death and", "08:52", "and things when we think of intelligence", "08:54", "though I think intelligence in our mind", "08:57", "is almost inexorably connected to all", "08:59", "the things that make us human like", "09:00", "emotions and and and ambition and all", "09:04", "these things like the reason why we", "09:06", "innovate like we it's not really clear", "09:09", "like why we innovate because we enjoy", "09:10", "innovation and because we want to make", "09:12", "the world a better place and because we", "09:13", "want to fix some problems that we've", "09:15", "created and we want to solve some", "09:17", "limitations of the human body and the", "09:19", "environment that we live in but we sort", "09:22", "of assumed that intelligence that we", "09:24", "create will also have some motivations", "09:27", "well there is a fairly large class of", "09:31", "possible structures you could do if you", "09:34", "want to do anything that has any kind of", "09:36", "cognitive or intellectual capacity at", "09:38", "all a large class of those would be what", "09:39", "we might call agent so this would be", "09:42", "yeah systems that interact with the", "09:44", "world in pursuit of some goal and if", "09:50", "there are a sophisticated class of", "09:52", "agents they they can plan ahead the", "09:54", "sequence of actions like more primitive", "09:56", "agents might just have reflexes but but", "10:00", "the sophisticated aidan might have a", "10:02", "model of the world where it can kind of", "10:04", "think ahead before it starts doing stuff", "10:06", "it can think what what would I need to", "10:08", "do in order to reach this desired state", "10:10", "and then recent backwards from that so I", "10:12", "think it's a fairly natural it's not the", "10:15", "only possible cognitive system you could", "10:16", "build but it's also not these weird", "10:18", "bizarre special case that you know it's", "10:21", "a fairly natural thing to tame for if", "10:23", "you are able to specify the goal", "10:25", "something you want to achieve but you", "10:27", "don't know how to achieve it the natural", "10:28", "way of trying to go about that is by", "10:30", "building the system that has this goal", "10:31", "and is an agent and then moves around", "10:33", "and tries different things and", "10:35", "eventually perhaps learned to solve that", "10:37", "task", "10:38", "do you anticipate different types of", "10:42", "artificial intelligence like artificial", "10:45", "intelligence that mimics the human", "10:48", "emotions like these do you think that", "10:50", "people will construct something that's", "10:52", "very similar to us in a way that we can", "10:55", "interact with it in in common terms or", "10:57", "do you think it will be almost like", "11:00", "communicating with an alien so they're", "11:05", "different scenarios here", "11:06", "I mean I guess my guess is that the", "11:08", "first thing that actually achieved super", "11:11", "intelligence would not be very", "11:12", "human-like there are different possible", "11:18", "ways you could try to get to this level", "11:20", "of Technology what one would be by", "11:21", "trying to reverse-engineer the human", "11:23", "brain mmm we have an existence in in the", "11:25", "limit limit in case you might imagine if", "11:27", "you just made an exact duplicate in in", "11:29", "silicon of the human brain like every", "11:31", "neuron had some counterpart so that that", "11:35", "that seems technologically very", "11:37", "difficult to do but it wouldn't require", "11:39", "in a big theoretical breakthrough to do", "11:41", "it you could just through if you had", "11:42", "sufficiently good microscopy and large", "11:44", "enough computers and in us elbow grease", "11:47", "you couldn't kind of it but it seems to", "11:49", "me plausible that what will work before", "11:51", "we are able to do it that way will be", "11:53", "some more synthetic approach work that", "11:57", "would only be a very rough resemblance", "11:58", "maybe with the neocortex yeah that's one", "12:02", "of the big questions right whether or", "12:04", "not we can replicate all the functions", "12:05", "of the human brain in the way it", "12:08", "functions in in like mimic it exactly or", "12:11", "whether we could have some sort of", "12:12", "superior method that achieves the same", "12:14", "results that the human brain does in", "12:16", "terms of its ability to calculate and", "12:17", "reason and and do multiple tasks at the", "12:20", "same time yeah and I also think that", "12:22", "maybe once you have a sufficiently high", "12:24", "level of this general form of", "12:27", "intelligence then you could use that", "12:29", "maybe to emulate or mimic things that we", "12:33", "do differently so maybe we our cortex is", "12:37", "quite limited so we rely a lot on", "12:39", "earlier neurological structures that we", "12:42", "have we have to we have to be guided by", "12:43", "motion because we can't just calculate", "12:45", "everything out mmm and an instinct and", "12:49", "and it made me and if we lost all of", "12:52", "that we would be helpless but maybe some", "12:53", "system that had a sufficiently high", "12:55", "level of this more abstract reasoning", "12:57", "capability could maybe use that to", "12:59", "substitute for things that weren't", "13:00", "built-in in the same way that we did", "13:02", "have you ever talked to Sam Harris about", "13:04", "this yeah a little bit have you ever had", "13:07", "a podcast with him oh yeah it actually", "13:09", "he had him on in his podcast", "13:11", "half a year ago I'll have to have to", "13:13", "listen to it because he has the worst", "13:15", "view of the the future and", "13:19", "of artificial intelligence he's", "13:21", "terrified of it and when I talked to him", "13:23", "terrifies me and Elon Musk is right up", "13:26", "there he also has a terrifying view of", "13:28", "what our artificial intelligence could", "13:30", "potentially be what do you say to those", "13:33", "guys well I mean I I do think that that", "13:36", "are these significant risks that will be", "13:40", "associated with this transition to the", "13:42", "machine intelligence era including", "13:45", "existential risks threats to the very", "13:47", "survival of humanity or what we care", "13:50", "about so why are we doing this well", "13:52", "there are a lot of things we're we're", "13:54", "doing that may be global it would be", "13:56", "better if we didn't do I mean just why", "13:58", "do we build thousands of nuclear weapons", "14:00", "all right why do we over fish the ocean", "14:02", "yeah so no I mean if one actually asked", "14:05", "why do different individuals work on AI", "14:08", "research or why do different companies", "14:11", "and governments funded I mean there a", "14:12", "lot of explanation it's like a great", "14:14", "scientific endeavor if you can make the", "14:17", "Google search engine 1% better that's", "14:19", "got to be worth like a billion dollars", "14:20", "right off the bat it's become a kind of", "14:23", "prestige thing now where nations want to", "14:26", "have some sort of strategy because it's", "14:27", "seen as this new frontier just like when", "14:31", "you had you know steam engines and", "14:35", "industrialization a few hundred years", "14:37", "ago and an electricity like it's good to", "14:39", "just open up a lot of economic", "14:41", "opportunities you want to be in there", "14:42", "where it's happy you are a various kind", "14:45", "of we're going to do subsistence", "14:46", "agriculture while in the rest of the", "14:48", "world is moving on so there's there's a", "14:51", "lot of its kind of over determined like", "14:53", "you could remove some of these reasons", "14:55", "and that would still be enough reasons", "14:56", "for why people would be pushing forward", "14:58", "with this one of the things that scares", "15:00", "me the most is the idea that if we do", "15:02", "create artificial intelligence then it", "15:04", "will improve upon our design and create", "15:07", "far more sophisticated versions of", "15:09", "itself and it'll continue to do that", "15:11", "until it's unrecognizable until it", "15:13", "reaches literally a god-like potential", "15:17", "mmm that I mean I forget what the real", "15:19", "numbers were maybe you could tell us but", "15:21", "someone had calculated some reputable", "15:23", "source had calculated the amount of", "15:26", "improvement that sentient artificial", "15:28", "intelligence would be able to create", "15:31", "inside of a small window of time", "15:32", "like if it was allowed to innovate and", "15:35", "then make better versions of itself and", "15:37", "those better versions of itself were", "15:38", "allowed to innovate and make better", "15:39", "versions of itself you're talking with", "15:41", "not an exponential increase of", "15:42", "intelligence but an explosion well we", "15:46", "don't know so it's hard enough to", "15:50", "forecast the pace at which we will make", "15:53", "advances in AI because we just don't", "15:55", "know how hard the problems are that we", "15:57", "haven't yet solved right and you know", "16:00", "once you get the human level or a little", "16:01", "bit above I mean who knows it could be", "16:04", "that there is some level where to get", "16:06", "further you need like to put in a lot of", "16:09", "thinking time to kind of get there now", "16:11", "what is easier to estimate is if you", "16:15", "just look at the speed because that's", "16:17", "just a function of the hardware that", "16:18", "you're running it on right so so there", "16:21", "we know that there is a lot of room in", "16:23", "principle if you look at the physics of", "16:25", "computation and you look at what would", "16:27", "an optimally arranged physical system be", "16:30", "that was optimized for computation that", "16:31", "would be like way many many orders above", "16:33", "what what we can do now and that then", "16:36", "you could have arbitrarily large systems", "16:38", "like that", "16:39", "so from from that point of view we know", "16:42", "that that could be things that would be", "16:43", "like a million times faster than the", "16:45", "human brain and with a lot more memory", "16:47", "and stuff like that and then something", "16:49", "if it did have a million times more", "16:52", "power than the human brain it could", "16:53", "create something with a million times", "16:55", "more computational power than itself it", "17:00", "could make better versions it could", "17:02", "continue to innovate like if let me", "17:04", "create something that we can we say you", "17:07", "are I mean it is sentient it is", "17:11", "artificial intelligence now please go", "17:14", "innovate please go follow the same", "17:16", "directive and improve upon your design", "17:18", "yeah well but we don't know how how long", "17:21", "that would take then we'll get to", "17:23", "something we already have sort of", "17:25", "millions of times more thinking capacity", "17:28", "than a human has I mean we have millions", "17:30", "of humans right so if you kind of break", "17:34", "it down you think there's like one", "17:36", "milestone when you have maybe an AI that", "17:37", "could do what one human can do but then", "17:39", "that might still be quite a lot of", "17:41", "orders of magnitude you know until it", "17:43", "would be equivalent of the whole human", "17:45", "species", "17:47", "and maybe during that time other things", "17:49", "happened maybe we upgrade you know our", "17:52", "own abilities in some way so there are", "17:54", "some scenarios where it's so hard to get", "17:56", "even to one human baseline that we kind", "17:59", "of use this massive amount of resources", "18:02", "just to barely create kind of you know", "18:05", "villages yes", "18:07", "using billions of dollars of compute", "18:09", "right so if that's the way we get there", "18:11", "then I mean it might take quite a while", "18:13", "because you can't easily scale something", "18:16", "that you've already spent billions of", "18:17", "dollars building yeah some people think", "18:19", "the whole thing is blown out of", "18:20", "proportion that we're so far away from", "18:22", "creating artificial

well", "25:52", "you know clearly that's not it's not", "25:54", "finished so there's gonna be another", "25:55", "version of it it's like when is this", "25:57", "version gonna take place is it gonna", "25:58", "take place over millions and millions of", "26:00", "years like it has historically when it", "26:02", "comes to biological organisms or is it", "26:05", "going to invent something

years have more number", "26:36", "of decades or whatever but but it's", "26:37", "interesting that even if we set that", "26:39", "aside we say", "26:40", "machine intelligence is possible for", "26:43", "some reason let's just play without then", "26:45", "I still think that would be very rapid", "26:47", "change including biological change and I", "26:51", "mean we are doing great advances

I", "27:18", "think it would still see quite profound", "27:20", "change just from applying bioscience to", "27:23", "change human capacities yeah one of the", "27:27", "technologies or one of the

some sort of a brain", "27:51", "implant that in that interacts with an", "27:54", "external device and this all of this", "27:57", "increases the bandwidth for available", "27:59", "intelligence and knowledge yeah I'm sort", "28:02", "of skeptical that that will work I mean", "28:04", "good that somebody tries it you know but", "28:08", "I think it's quite technically hard to", "28:11", "improve and normal healthy human beings", "28:16", "say cognitive capacity are the", "28:19", "capacities by implanting things in them", "28:21", "and get benefits that you couldn't", "28:24", "equally well get by having the gadget", "28:25", "outside of the body so I I don't need to", "28:30", "have an implant to be able to use Google", "28:31", "right right and there are a lot of", "28:34", "advantages to having it external you you", "28:37", "can upgrade it very easily you can shut", "28:39", "it off because well hopefully you could", "28:41", "do that even within Fanta and once you", "28:44", "start to look into the details there's", "28:46", "are these kind of demos but then if you", "28:47", "if you actually look at the papers often", "28:50", "you find well and then the way these", "28:51", "side effects and", "28:52", "today so they had some deficit and the", "28:55", "speech do you know like yeah infection", "28:57", "like it is just palate is messy yes so", "29:02", "maybe it will work better than done I", "29:05", "expect that that could be good but", "29:07", "otherwise I think that the the place", "29:12", "where it will first become possible to", "29:13", "enhance kind of human biological", "29:17", "capacities would be through genetic", "29:21", "selection which is technologically", "29:25", "something very near you mean what CRISPR", "29:28", "type lot so that would be editing right", "29:30", "when you actually go in and change", "29:31", "things that also is moving we don't mean", "29:33", "by selection also this would recipe in", "29:34", "the context of say in vitro", "29:36", "fertilization you have usually some", "29:39", "half-dozen or dozen embryos created", "29:42", "during this fertility procedure which is", "29:44", "standard ly used so rather than just the", "29:46", "doctor kind of looking at these embryos", "29:48", "and saying well that one looks healthier", "29:49", "I'm going to implant that you could run", "29:52", "some genetic tests and then use that as", "29:55", "a predictor and select the one you think", "29:58", "has the most desirable attributes and so", "30:02", "this could be a trend in terms of how", "30:04", "human beings reproduce that we instead", "30:07", "of just randomly having sex woman gets", "30:10", "pregnant gives birth to a child we don't", "30:12", "know what it's gonna be what its what's", "30:14", "gonna happen we just hope that it's a", "30:16", "good kid instead of that you start", "30:19", "looking at the all of various components", "30:22", "that we can measure yeah and so I mean", "30:26", "to some extent we already do this there", "30:28", "are a lot of testing done for various", "30:34", "chromosomal abnormalities that you can", "30:36", "already check for but but our ability to", "30:38", "to look beyond clear stark diseases that", "30:42", "is one gene is wrong like they look at", "30:45", "more complex trait this is increasing", "30:47", "rapidly so obviously there are a lot of", "30:50", "ethical issues and yeah but if I were", "30:53", "just talking what is technologically", "30:54", "feasible and I think that that I mean", "30:57", "already could do a very limited amount", "30:58", "of that today and maybe you'd get you", "31:03", "know two or three IQ points in", "31:05", "expectation more", "31:06", "if you selected using current technology", "31:08", "based on 10 embryos let us say so very", "31:11", "small but but as genomics gets better at", "31:15", "deciphering the genetic architecture of", "31:18", "complex traits whether its intelligence", "31:20", "or our personality attributes then then", "31:22", "you would have more selection power and", "31:24", "you could do more and then there is a", "31:26", "number of other technologies we don't", "31:28", "yet have but which if you did would then", "31:29", "kind of stack with that and enable much", "31:31", "more powerful forms of of enhancement so", "31:36", "so so there yeah I don't think there are", "31:38", "and any major technological hurdles", "31:42", "really in the way just some small amount", "31:44", "of incremental further improvement", "31:46", "that's when you talk about doing", "31:50", "something with genetics and human beings", "31:54", "and selecting selecting for the superior", "31:57", "versions and then if everybody starts", "32:00", "doing that the ethical concerns when you", "32:02", "start discussing that people get very", "32:04", "nervous because I started to look at", "32:05", "their own genetic defects and they go oh", "32:07", "my god what if I didn't make the cut", "32:08", "like I wouldn't be here and he started", "32:10", "thinking about all the imperfect people", "32:12", "that have actually contributed in some", "32:14", "pretty spectacular ways to what our", "32:16", "culture is and like well if everybody", "32:19", "has perfect genes with all these things", "32:21", "even take place like what are we doing", "32:22", "really if we're bypassing nature and", "32:25", "we're choosing to select for the traits", "32:28", "and the attributes that we find to be", "32:30", "the most positive and attractive like", "32:33", "what are like that I think what what", "32:37", "would happen if say some earlier age had", "32:40", "had this ability to kind of lock in", "32:43", "there yes you know that their prejudices", "32:47", "or if the Victorians had had issues we", "32:51", "would all be whatever pious and", "32:53", "patriotic now or something yeah yeah so", "32:58", "so so it in in general with all of these", "33:02", "powerful technologies we we are", "33:04", "developing that there is like I think", "33:07", "the ideal course would be that we would", "33:08", "first gain a bit more wisdom and then we", "33:12", "would get all of these powerful tools", "33:14", "but it looks like we are getting the", "33:16", "powerful tools before we have really", "33:19", "achieved a very high level of wisdom", "33:21", "yeah but we haven't earned them the", "33:24", "people that are using them are sort of", "33:26", "where we haven't like think about the", "33:30", "technology that all of us use how many", "33:32", "how many pieces of technology to use in", "33:35", "the day and how much do you actually", "33:36", "understand any of those most people have", "33:39", "very little understanding if I any of", "33:41", "the things they use work they put no", "33:43", "effort at all into creating those things", "33:46", "but yet they've inherited the", "33:47", "responsibility of the power that those", "33:49", "things possess yeah I mean that's the", "33:51", "only way we can do it it's just way too", "33:53", "complex for any person if you had to", "33:56", "sort of learn how to build everything", "33:58", "ever told you use like we wouldn't get", "34:00", "very far", "34:01", "isn't that fascinating though when you", "34:02", "think about human beings and all the", "34:03", "different things we do we have very", "34:06", "little understanding of the mechanisms", "34:09", "behind most of what we need for", "34:11", "day-to-day life yet we just use them", "34:14", "because there's so many of us and so", "34:16", "many people are understanding various", "34:17", "parts of all these different things that", "34:19", "together collectively we can utilize the", "34:22", "intelligence of all these millions of", "34:24", "people that have innovated and we with", "34:26", "no work whatsoever just go into the", "34:28", "Verizon store and pick up the new phone", "34:29", "yeah I mean and not just technology but", "34:33", "worldviews and political ideas as well", "34:36", "it's not as if most people sit down with", "34:41", "an empty table try to think from the", "34:42", "basic principles of what would be the", "34:44", "ideal configuration of the state or", "34:46", "something like that you just kind of", "34:48", "absorb it and go with it you float in", "34:50", "the stream of nature and and it's", "34:54", "amazing just how little of that actually", "34:56", "at any point channels through your sort", "34:58", "of conscious attention where you make", "34:59", "some rational otherwise but like", "35:01", "deliberate decision most you just get", "35:04", "carried away with so but but that that", "35:07", "again I mean if we have if this is what", "35:10", "we have to work with then there's no", "35:12", "other way you know otherwise I know it's", "35:14", "there's no other way and there's no way", "35:16", "even like you and I discussing this like", "35:19", "discussing the the history of this", "35:22", "incredible spike of evolution or", "35:25", "innovation rather in technology it feet", "35:28", "just doesn't feel like anything it feels", "35:32", "normal", "35:33", "so even though we can intellectualize it", "35:36", "even though we can have this", "35:37", "conversation talk about what an", "35:38", "incredible time work and how terrifying", "35:40", "it is the things are moving at such an", "35:42", "incredibly rapid rate and no one no", "35:45", "one's putting the brakes on it no one's", "35:47", "thinking about the the potential pros", "35:49", "and cons we're just pushing ahead yeah", "35:52", "well not nobody not no I mean there are", "35:54", "seeing people come to my research yes", "35:56", "there's actually increase I mean when I", "35:58", "I got interested in these things in the", "36:01", "90s and it was very much a fringe", "36:04", "activity there was some internet mailing", "36:06", "list some people exchanging ideas but", "36:08", "but ever since then I mean there's now a", "36:11", "small set of academic research", "36:14", "institutes and some other that are kind", "36:16", "of actually trying to do more systemic", "36:18", "thinking about some of these big picture", "36:21", "topics when did it seem like it was", "36:22", "possible like if you got involved in it", "36:24", "in the 90s it must have seemed like some", "36:26", "very fringe sort of pie in the sky idea", "36:29", "of an hour general artificial", "36:32", "intelligence as a retard specifically", "36:34", "about a yeah well actually the field of", "36:39", "artificial intelligence sometimes is", "36:41", "kind of dated to 1956 there was a", "36:44", "conference but I mean it's somewhat", "36:46", "normal sure but roughly that's when it", "36:47", "got started but the pioneers even right", "36:51", "back at the beginning thought that they", "36:55", "would gonna be able to do all the things", "36:57", "that the human brain does and in fact", "36:59", "they were quite optimistic like thought", "37:01", "maybe 10 years of something like that", "37:02", "back then yeah many of them really even", "37:04", "before computers no they had computers", "37:06", "you know 56 yeah what kind of computers", "37:09", "well as well yeah slow computers when", "37:12", "when was the computer invented well it's", "37:15", "one of those things I think during the", "37:20", "the Second World War they had computers", "37:24", "that were useful for doing stuff and", "37:26", "before that I had kind of tabulating", "37:28", "machines and before that I had designs", "37:32", "for things that if there had been put", "37:34", "together would have been able to", "37:35", "calculate a lot of numbers and then", "37:38", "before that they had an abacus bit kind", "37:40", "of there's a number of like that the", "37:43", "line from having some external tool like", "37:45", "a notepad which", "37:47", "you can you can calculate bigger numbers", "37:48", "right if you can scribble on a piece of", "37:50", "paper to a modern-day supercomputer like", "37:53", "you did that kind of you can break it", "37:55", "down into small steps and they happen", "37:57", "gradually but but yeah roughly since", "37:59", "they the the 40s or so that's when they", "38:03", "first invented I like an electrical yeah", "38:05", "yeah I think so", "38:08", "even back then they thought we were only", "38:10", "about 10 years away well some plows in", "38:13", "in the in the mid-50s when when people", "38:15", "started using the word artificial", "38:16", "intelligence some of these AI", "38:18", "researchers at a time where were quite", "38:20", "optimistic about the timelines in fact", "38:26", "there was some some some summer project", "38:31", "that we're gonna have a few students or", "38:33", "whatever and work over the summer and I", "38:34", "thought oh maybe we can solve vision", "38:36", "over the summer and now we've kind of", "38:39", "Sol edition but that's like 60 years", "38:41", "later so it can be hard to know how hard", "38:44", "the problem is until you've actually", "38:45", "solved it but the really interesting", "38:48", "thing to me is that even though I can", "38:51", "understand why they were wrong about how", "38:52", "difficult it is because how would you", "38:54", "know right if it's ten years of work or", "38:56", "100 years of work kind of hard to", "38:58", "estimate at the outset but what is", "39:00", "striking is that even the ones who", "39:02", "thought it was ten years away it they", "39:04", "didn't think of what the obvious next", "39:06", "step would be after that like if you", "39:08", "actually succeeded at mechanizing all", "39:10", "the functions of the human mind that", "39:13", "they couldn't it I think well it's", "39:14", "obviously not going to stop there once", "39:16", "you get human equivalents like you're", "39:17", "going to get super intelligence but it", "39:21", "was as if the imagination muscle had so", "39:23", "exhausted itself thinking of this", "39:24", "radical possibility you could have a", "39:26", "machine that does everything that the", "39:27", "human knows that it couldn't kind of", "39:29", "take the next step after that or or for", "39:32", "that matter the immense ethical and", "39:35", "social implications even if all you", "39:36", "could do is to replicate a human mind", "39:38", "like in a machine that if you actually", "39:40", "thought you were building that and you", "39:41", "were 10 years away you'd be crazy not to", "39:44", "spend like a lot of time thinking about", "39:45", "how this is going to impact the world", "39:47", "but that didn't really seem to have", "39:49", "occurred much to them at all well", "39:51", "sometimes it seems that people just want", "39:53", "to do it like even with the creation of", "39:58", "the atomic bomb I mean they they", "40:00", "felt like they had to do it because we", "40:02", "had to develop it before the Germans did", "40:03", "right but there was a specific reason", "40:06", "like you know suggest it could be fun to", "40:08", "do right sure", "40:09", "and so with the Manhattan Project", "40:11", "obviously it was during wartime and", "40:14", "maybe Hitler had a program they thought", "40:16", "so you can easily see why that yeah it", "40:19", "would motivate a lot of people but even", "40:22", "even before they actually started the", "40:24", "Manhattan product so the guy who kind of", "40:26", "first conceived of the idea that you", "40:28", "could make a nuclear explosion Leo", "40:30", "Szilard he was the was a kind of", "40:34", "eccentric physicist who conceived of the", "40:38", "idea of a chain reaction so it's been", "40:40", "known before that that you could split", "40:41", "the atom and a little bit of energy came", "40:43", "out but if you're going to split one", "40:45", "atom at a time right you're never gonna", "40:47", "get anything because it's too little so", "40:49", "the idea of a chain reaction was that if", "40:51", "you split an atom when it releases two", "40:53", "neutrons in each of those can split", "40:55", "another two atoms that then these four", "40:58", "neutrons and you get an exposure an", "41:01", "exponential blow-up and so he thought of", "41:03", "this I forget exactly one it must have", "41:05", "been in the third early thirties", "41:07", "probably and he was a remarkable person", "41:12", "because he didn't just think oh this is", "41:14", "a fun idea I should publish it and you", "41:16", "know get a lot of citations but he", "41:17", "thought like what would this mean for", "41:19", "the world like the idea this is this", "41:22", "could be bad for civilization and so he", "41:25", "then went to try to persuade some other", "41:28", "of his colleagues who were also working", "41:30", "in nuclear physics not not to pursue", "41:32", "this not to publish on related areas and", "41:35", "some partial success so there were some", "41:39", "partial success were his college some", "41:41", "some things were not published", "41:42", "immediately it's not known all of his", "41:44", "colleagues listened to him so of course", "41:46", "isn't that the problem was that some", "41:48", "people were always going to want to be", "41:50", "the ones that sort of innovate that is", "41:53", "the problem in those cases were you", "41:54", "would actually prefer the innovation not", "41:56", "to happen yes historically of course we", "41:58", "now look back and think there are a lot", "42:02", "of dissenters that we are now glad could", "42:06", "have their way because a lot of cultures", "42:10", "were quite resistant to innovation", "42:14", "and I wanted to do the way things had", "42:16", "always been whether it's like social", "42:18", "innovation or technological innovation", "42:20", "you know that the Chinese were at one", "42:23", "point ahead in seafaring exploring and", "42:27", "then they shot all of that down because", "42:29", "the the Emperor at the time I guess", "42:30", "didn't like it and so there are many", "42:33", "examples of kind of stasis but as long", "42:36", "as there were a lot of different places", "42:37", "a lot of different countries a lot of", "42:38", "different Mavericks then somebody would", "42:40", "always do it and then once the others", "42:42", "could see that it worked you know that", "42:44", "could kind of copy and things move", "42:46", "forward but of course if there is a", "42:48", "technology you actually want not to be", "42:50", "developed then this multipolar situation", "42:54", "makes it very very hard to coordinate to", "42:57", "refrain from doing that and yeah this", "43:02", "this I think is a kind of structural", "43:04", "problem in the current human condition", "43:07", "that is ultimately responsible for a lot", "43:11", "of the existential risks that we will", "43:12", "face in this century there's this kind", "43:15", "of failure of ability to solve global", "43:18", "coordination problems yeah and when you", "43:20", "think about the people that did in", "43:22", "Oppenheimer and the people behind the", "43:24", "Manhattan Project they were inventing", "43:27", "this to deal with this existential", "43:29", "threat this horrific threat from Nazi", "43:32", "Germany this the Japanese and of the", "43:35", "world war two you know this this idea", "43:37", "that this evil empire is going to try to", "43:39", "take over the world and this created the", "43:42", "momentum and this created the motivation", "43:44", "to develop this incredible technology", "43:47", "that wind up making a great amount of", "43:50", "our electricity and wound up creating", "43:53", "enough nuclear weapons to destroy the", "43:55", "entire world many times over and we're", "43:58", "in this strange state now or it was", "44:00", "motivated by this horrific moment in", "44:03", "history this evil empire that tries to", "44:06", "take over the world and we come up with", "44:08", "this incredible technological solution", "44:10", "the ultimate weapon that we detonate a", "44:12", "couple of times on some cities and then", "44:15", "now we're in this weird state where you", "44:18", "know we're how many years later of 80", "44:21", "years later and we were not doing it", "44:23", "anymore we don't drop any bombs on", "44:25", "people anymore but we all have them", "44:27", "and we all have them pointed at all well", "44:29", "yes which is a good thing quite a few", "44:32", "but it's incredible that the motivation", "44:36", "for this incredible technology this", "44:37", "amazing technology was actually to deal", "44:40", "with something that was awful yeah yeah", "44:43", "I mean war has been a like had a way of", "44:47", "focusing minds and stuff now I think", "44:49", "that nuclear energy we would have had", "44:50", "anyway maybe it would have been", "44:52", "developed like five years or ten years", "44:54", "later reactors are not that difficult to", "44:59", "do", "45:00", "so I think we could have gotten to all", "45:03", "the good uses of nuclear technology that", "45:06", "we have today without having to had kind", "45:09", "of a nuclear bomb developed now you pay", "45:11", "attention to like Boston Dynamics and", "45:13", "all these all these different robotic", "45:15", "creations that they've made well they", "45:18", "seem to have a penchant for doing the", "45:19", "relay sinister-looking", "45:21", "but I think all robots that are you know", "45:25", "anything that looks autonomous is kind", "45:27", "of sinister looking you see the Japan", "45:29", "yeah I mean like the Japanese have these", "45:31", "like big eyed sort of rounded so it's a", "45:33", "different China Turkish Boston Dynamics", "45:35", "is like I want the Pentagon to give them", "45:37", "funding or something right DARPA", "45:39", "yeah they'll they look like they're", "45:41", "developing terminators yeah yeah but but", "45:44", "what I was thinking is if we do", "45:48", "eventually come to a time where those", "45:51", "things are going to war for us instead", "45:54", "of us like if we get involved in robot", "45:57", "wars our robots versus their robots and", "46:01", "this becomes the next motivation for", "46:03", "increased technological innovation to", "46:05", "try to deal with superior robots by the", "46:07", "Soviet Union or by China like these", "46:10", "these are more things that could be", "46:12", "threats that could push people to some", "46:14", "crazy level of technological innovation", "46:17", "yeah it could I mean I think there are", "46:20", "other drivers for technological", "46:23", "innovation as well that that seems of", "46:27", "plenty strong", "46:29", "sure commercial drivers let to say that", "46:33", "we wouldn't have to rely on on war or", "46:36", "the threat of war it's a kind of stay", "46:38", "innovative", "46:40", "and I mean there has been this effort to", "46:44", "try to see if it would be possible to", "46:46", "have some kind of ban on lethal", "46:49", "autonomous weapons mmm just as I mean", "46:52", "there are huge technologies that we have", "46:54", "like there is has been a relatively", "46:56", "successful ban on chemical and", "46:58", "biological weapons and which have by and", "47:02", "large been you know honored and upheld", "47:07", "there there are kind of treaties on", "47:09", "nuclear weapons which has limited", "47:12", "proliferation yes there are no maybe I", "47:14", "don't know it doesn't I don't know the", "47:16", "exact number but it's certainly a lot", "47:18", "better than 50 or 100 countries yes and", "47:22", "some other weapons as well", "47:24", "blinding lasers landmines monster", "47:28", "munitions and so so so some people think", "47:30", "maybe we could do something like this", "47:32", "with lethal autonomous weapons killer", "47:34", "BOTS that you do we is that really what", "47:36", "humanity needs most now like another", "47:39", "arms race to develop like a killer bot", "47:41", "it seems arguably the answer to that is", "47:44", "no I've I've kind of there's a lot of my", "47:50", "friends are supported I kind of stayed a", "47:52", "little bit on the sidelines on that", "47:54", "particular campaign being a little", "47:57", "unsure exactly what it is that I mean", "48:01", "certainly I think it'd be better if we", "48:03", "refrain from having some arms race to", "48:05", "develop these they're not but if you", "48:08", "start to look in more detail what what", "48:09", "precisely is the thing that you're", "48:10", "hoping to ban so if the idea is the", "48:13", "autonomous bit like the robot should not", "48:15", "be able to make its own firing decision", "48:17", "well right if the alternative to that is", "48:21", "there is some 19 year old guy sitting in", "48:24", "some office building and his job is", "48:26", "whenever the screen flashes fire now he", "48:29", "has to press a red button mmm and then", "48:31", "exactly the same thing happens I mean", "48:33", "I'm not sure how much is gained by", "48:34", "having that extra step but it is", "48:38", "something it feels better for us for", "48:40", "sure", "48:40", "okay so I'm not pushing the button right", "48:42", "but exactly what does that mean like in", "48:44", "every particular fire decision or is it", "48:46", "like some well you've got to attack this", "48:50", "group of surface ships here and like", "48:52", "here are the general parameters and", "48:54", "you're", "48:54", "not to fire outside this these", "48:56", "coordinates like interstate I I don't", "48:58", "know I mean another is the question of", "49:01", "it would be better if I had no wars but", "49:03", "if there is going to be a war maybe it", "49:06", "is better if it's robot the robot or", "49:08", "horev if there's got to be bombing like", "49:11", "maybe you want the bombs to have high", "49:13", "precision rather than low precision like", "49:16", "get fewer civilian casualties and", "49:18", "operating under artificial intelligence", "49:21", "also depends exactly on her so I don't", "49:24", "know I mean on the other hand you could", "49:25", "imagine it kind of reduces the threshold", "49:27", "for going to war if you think that you", "49:29", "wouldn't fear any casualties maybe it", "49:31", "would be more than I eager to do it bro", "49:33", "or or or if it proliferates and you have", "49:36", "these kind of mosquito sized killer BOTS", "49:38", "that terrorists have and you know it's", "49:42", "not not doesn't seem like a good thing", "49:43", "to have a society we having like a", "49:45", "facial recognition thing and then the", "49:47", "bot flies out and you just have a kind", "49:49", "of dystopia so yeah I think we're", "49:53", "thinking rationally if you're thinking", "49:55", "rationally given the overall view of the", "49:59", "human race that we want peace and", "50:01", "everything to be well but realistically", "50:04", "if you were someone who is trying to", "50:06", "attack someone militarily you'd want the", "50:09", "best possible weapons it give you the", "50:11", "best possible advantage and that's why", "50:14", "we had to develop the atomic bomb first", "50:16", "it's probably why we'll develop the or", "50:19", "we'll try to develop the killer", "50:21", "autonomous robot first yeah yeah I mean", "50:25", "some guys would have it right the fair", "50:26", "that the other is yeah so this is what", "50:28", "it's basically a coordination problem", "50:31", "like it's hard for any one country", "50:34", "unilaterally to make sure that the world", "50:37", "is is peaceful and sure and kind right", "50:40", "it requires everybody to synchronize", "50:43", "their actions and and then then you can", "50:45", "have successes like we've had with some", "50:47", "of these treaties like we've not had a", "50:49", "big arms race in biological weapons or", "50:52", "in chemical weapons I mean they have", "50:53", "been that were there were cheaters even", "50:55", "on the biological warfare program like", "50:57", "the Soviet Union had massive efforts", "51:00", "there but still probably less use of", "51:02", "that and less development and if there", "51:04", "had been no such treaty so", "51:08", "and our just look at the amount of money", "51:10", "being wasted every year to maintain", "51:13", "these large Arsenal's so that we can", "51:15", "kill one another I wonder we decide to", "51:16", "do it like that there's gotta be a", "51:18", "better way yeah we're getting there it's", "51:20", "hard yeah we would hope that we would", "51:22", "get to some point where all this would", "51:23", "be irrelevant yeah because there's no", "51:25", "more war yeah and so if you look at the", "51:29", "the biggest efforts so far to make that", "51:33", "happen so after the First World War", "51:34", "people were really aware of that said", "51:37", "this this sucks like war I mean look at", "51:39", "this like a whole generation just ground", "51:41", "up", "51:42", "machine guns like this is gotta make", "51:44", "sure this never happens again so they", "51:45", "tried to do the League of nation but", "51:48", "then didn't really invest it with very", "51:49", "much power and then the second war", "51:53", "Second World War happened and then again", "51:55", "just after that it's fresh in people's", "51:57", "memories and well never again this is it", "51:59", "the United Nations and in Europe the", "52:02", "European Union it's kind of both", "52:04", "designed as ways to try to prevent this", "52:06", "but again with kind of maybe in the case", "52:09", "of the United Nations quite limited", "52:11", "powers to actually enforce the agreement", "52:13", "and there's a veto which makes it hardly", "52:15", "fits two of the major powers that are at", "52:17", "loggerheads so it might be that if that", "52:21", "were worth a third big conflagration", "52:24", "that then people would say well this", "52:26", "time you know we've got it really we got", "52:30", "to really put something kind of", "52:31", "institutional solution in place that has", "52:33", "enough enforcement power that we don't", "52:35", "try this yet again so we don't have a", "52:37", "second robot war so once we get to a", "52:40", "first robot I mean it kind of memories", "52:43", "fade right yes that's the problem so", "52:45", "even the Cold War I mean I grew up I'm", "52:48", "Swedish I remember we were kind of in", "52:50", "between right and and we were taught", "52:53", "these goals about and you could have", "52:54", "fallout and stuff like it's like a very", "52:56", "palpable sense that at any given point", "52:58", "in time that could be some", "53:00", "miscalculation or crisis or some", "53:02", "something and and like all the way up to", "53:08", "see senior statesmen at the time this is", "53:10", "this were like a very real and very", "53:12", "serious and I feel this up that memory", "53:14", "of just how bad it is to live in that", "53:16", "kind of hair trigger a nuclear arms race", "53:20", "called war situation has kind of", "53:22", "did and now we think maybe you know the", "53:24", "world didn't blow up so maybe it wasn't", "53:26", "so bad after all", "53:27", "well I think that would be the wrong", "53:28", "lesson to learn well it's a bit like", "53:31", "you're playing Russian roulette", "53:33", "yeah and you survived one and you say", "53:34", "well it isn't so dangerous at all to", "53:36", "play Russian roulette I think I'm gonna", "53:37", "have another girl like that you gotta", "53:39", "realize like well maybe that was the 10%", "53:41", "chance or a 30% chance that the world", "53:43", "would pop during the Cold War and we", "53:45", "were lucky but it doesn't mean we want", "53:47", "to have another one when I was in high", "53:49", "school it was a real threat when I was", "53:50", "in high school everyone was terrified", "53:52", "that we were gonna go to war with Russia", "53:53", "it was a big thing and and you talked to", "53:57", "people from my generation about that and", "53:59", "everybody remembers it remember that", "54:00", "feeling that you had in high school like", "54:03", "we there any at any day something can go", "54:06", "wrong and we could be at war with", "54:08", "another country that's a nuclear", "54:11", "superpower yeah but that's all gone now", "54:12", "like that that feeling that fear people", "54:15", "are so confident that that's not going", "54:17", "to happen that that's not even in", "54:18", "people's consciousness and then a number", "54:25", "of maneuvers are made and then you find", "54:27", "yourself in the kind of situation where", "54:31", "there is like honored stake and", "54:32", "reputation and you feel you can't back", "54:34", "down and then another thing happens and", "54:36", "you get into this place where if you", "54:37", "even say something kind about the other", "54:39", "side your seem to be like you know", "54:41", "you're a soft you're a pinky or a lion", "54:43", "on both sides in the other side as well", "54:46", "obviously they're gonna have the same", "54:47", "internal dynamic and each side's has bad", "54:49", "things about the other it makes the", "54:50", "other side hate them even more and these", "54:52", "things are then hard to reverse like", "54:54", "once you find this dynamic happening", "54:56", "it's it's kind of almost it's not too", "54:57", "late you can try it but but it can be", "54:59", "very hard to back out of that and so if", "55:02", "you can prevent yourself from going down", "55:04", "that path to begin with that that's much", "55:06", "preferable when you see Boston Dynamics", "55:08", "and you see those robots", "55:10", "is there something comparable that's", "55:12", "being developed either in the Soviet", "55:13", "Union or in China or somewhere else in", "55:16", "the world where there's similar type", "55:17", "robots well I think a lot of the Boston", "55:21", "dynamic things seems more showy than", "55:23", "actually useful there's kind of animal", "55:27", "like things that hop around and", "55:29", "mmm 150 decibel or something like if I", "55:33", "were special ops trying to sneak in like", "55:35", "I wouldn't want this kind of big alarm", "55:39", "but but I think a lot of action would be", "55:42", "more in terms of flying drones", "55:45", "maybe submarine stuff missiles that kind", "55:50", "of stuff but are you when when you see", "55:52", "these robots and you you you know see", "55:57", "like the the ones that look like dogs or", "55:59", "like insects and couldn't you imagine", "56:02", "those things being armed with with when", "56:07", "they are then they don't it doesn't", "56:08", "really look showy anymore it seems", "56:10", "pretty effective like you can't even", "56:11", "kick those things over yeah yeah well I", "56:14", "mean I think if it has a gun I mean it", "56:16", "doesn't really matter whether it looks", "56:19", "like a dog or if it's just a small", "56:20", "flying platform sure I mean in general I", "56:23", "think that the more with with AI and", "56:25", "robotics like the more the cooler", "56:27", "something looks usually technically the", "56:29", "less impressive it is as you see these", "56:32", "huge yeah I would say the extreme case", "56:35", "of this is these robots that look", "56:37", "exactly like a human like maybe like", "56:40", "shaped like a beautiful woman or", "56:41", "something like that and then there are", "56:43", "complete hype and nowak you know I was", "56:46", "at the movies obviously they do it", "56:48", "because they don't want to film in", "56:50", "movies but but every once in a while you", "56:51", "have some press release I forget what", "56:54", "the name is of this female looking robot", "56:58", "that got citizenship in Saudi Arabia", "57:00", "three years ago it's like a publicity", "57:02", "stunt but but the media just laps it up", "57:04", "Wow they've created is like it's exactly", "57:06", "like a human like what a big", "57:08", "breakthrough and and it's like nothing", "57:10", "do you anticipate like when you see ex", "57:13", "machina do you think that that's", "57:15", "something that could be realistically", "57:18", "that could be implemented in a hundred", "57:21", "years or so like we really could have", "57:24", "some form of artificial human that's", "57:27", "indistinguishable well I think the", "57:30", "action is not gonna lie in the the the", "57:35", "the robotic part so much as in the brain", "57:38", "part like I think it's the AI part and", "57:41", "robotics only insofar as it", "57:43", "becomes enabled by having say much", "57:45", "better learning algorithms study so", "57:47", "right now if you have a robot for the", "57:49", "most part in any one of these big", "57:50", "factories it's like a blind dumb thing", "57:53", "that executes a pre-programmed set of", "57:56", "motions over and over again mm-hm and if", "57:58", "you want to change off the production", "58:00", "you need to get in some engineers to", "58:01", "reprogram it right but with a human you", "58:04", "could kind of show them how to do", "58:06", "something once or twice and then they", "58:08", "can do it so it will be interesting to", "58:10", "see over the next few years whether we", "58:14", "can see some kind of progress in", "58:15", "robotics that enable this kind of", "58:17", "imitation learning to work well enough", "58:20", "that you could actually start doing it", "58:21", "in any kind of baby there are", "58:23", "demonstrations already but but robustly", "58:25", "not that that it would be useful and you", "58:27", "could replace a lot of these kind of", "58:29", "industrial robotics experts by having", "58:33", "this so yeah so I think I mean in terms", "58:39", "of making things look like human I think", "58:41", "that's more for for Hollywood and and", "58:43", "for press releases that and then the", "58:45", "actual driver of progress then more so", "58:48", "the actual driver of progress but", "58:50", "someone is going to probably try to", "58:52", "replicate a human being once the", "58:53", "technology becomes viable and one of the", "58:56", "more disturbing ex machina I have", "58:58", "probably all my Nonna's yeah I just it's", "59:01", "a little bit of a blur ease is I've seen", "59:03", "some of these and not others and this", "59:08", "guy lives in the very remote location", "59:10", "yeah like a beautiful place enormous", "59:12", "yeah yeah yeah created this beautiful", "59:15", "girl robot a seduces that man and at the", "59:19", "end of it she leaves him locked up in", "59:21", "this thing and it just takes off and", "59:23", "gets on the helicopter and flies away", "59:25", "and the thing that's disturbing is that", "59:27", "they it she knew how to manipulate his", "59:30", "emotions to achieve a desired result", "59:31", "which was him helping her escape yeah", "59:34", "and but then once she did she had no", "59:36", "real emotions so he's screaming and you", "59:39", "know she had no compassion and no", "59:40", "empathy she just hopped on the", "59:41", "helicopter and left and they're starved", "59:42", "to death inside that locked box and that", "59:45", "is what scares people this idea that", "59:48", "we're going to create something that's", "59:49", "intelligence it has intelligence but", "59:51", "like us but it doesn't have all the", "59:53", "things that we have like caring right", "59:55", "love", "59:56", "friendship compassion the need for other", "59:59", "human beings if you develop an", "60:01", "autonomous robot that's really", "60:03", "autonomous there's no need for other", "60:04", "people that's where we get weirded out", "60:07", "like it doesn't need us right yeah I", "60:10", "mean I think the same with all even if", "60:12", "it were not a robot but just a program", "60:13", "in inside lecture but but yeah yeah and", "60:17", "the idea that you could have something", "60:19", "that is strategic and deceptive and so", "60:21", "forth yes I mean but then other elements", "60:23", "of the movie of course and in general a", "60:26", "reason why it's bad to get your kind of", "60:28", "map of the future from from Hollywood", "60:32", "so if you think this is one guy", "60:34", "presumably some genius living out in the", "60:36", "nowhere and kind of inventing this whole", "60:38", "system work in reality yeah it's like", "60:42", "anything else a lot like hundreds of", "60:43", "people programming away on their", "60:44", "computers writing on whiteboards and", "60:47", "sharing ideas with other people across", "60:49", "the world it doesn't look like a human", "60:55", "and that would often be some economic", "60:59", "reason for doing it in the first place", "61:01", "like not just oh we have this Promethean", "61:03", "attitude that we want to kind of bring", "61:06", "and I like so so all of those things", "61:10", "don't make for such good plot lines so", "61:13", "they just get removed but then I wonder", "61:14", "if people actually think that is the", "61:16", "future in terms of some kind of", "61:19", "supervillain and some hero and it's", "61:21", "gonna come down to these two people and", "61:23", "they're gonna wrestle and yeah you know", "61:26", "and it's gonna be very personalized and", "61:28", "concrete and localized whereas a lot of", "61:30", "things that determine what happens in", "61:32", "the world are very spread out there are", "61:33", "no pure crises churning away and sure", "61:37", "yeah that was a big problem that a lot", "61:39", "of people had but the movie was the idea", "61:41", "that this one man could innovate at such", "61:43", "a high level and be so far beyond", "61:45", "everyone else is ridiculous that he's", "61:47", "just doing it by himself on this year", "61:50", "compound somewhere", "61:52", "come on yeah that's that but that makes", "61:54", "a great movie right yeah flying in the", "61:57", "helicopter drop you off a remote", "61:58", "location that shows you something he's", "62:00", "created that is gonna change the whole", "62:02", "world", "62:03", "and it looked beautiful I mean I could", "62:04", "imagine doing some writers you ever", "62:06", "tweet there or something well when the", "62:09", "iconic", "62:10", "image of aliens from another world is", "62:12", "this these little gray things with no", "62:17", "sexual organs and large heads and black", "62:20", "eyes this is the iconic thing that we", "62:24", "imagined when we think about things from", "62:26", "another planet I've often wondered if", "62:30", "what we think of with in terms of like", "62:33", "artificial life from another plant or", "62:35", "life from another planet is that it's", "62:37", "like an artificial creation like in our", "62:39", "ideas that we understand that the", "62:41", "biological limitations of the body when", "62:42", "it comes to traveling through space the", "62:44", "dealing with radiation death need for", "62:47", "food things along those lines that what", "62:50", "we would do is create some artificial", "62:53", "thing to travel for us like we've", "62:55", "already done on Mars right we had a", "62:57", "rover that roams around Mars the next", "62:59", "step would be an artificial autonomous", "63:03", "intelligent creature that has no", "63:05", "biological limitations like we do in", "63:07", "terms of like its ability to absorb", "63:09", "radiation from space and we create one", "63:12", "of those little guys just like that", "63:14", "would enormous head no sex organs", "63:16", "doesn't need sex organs you know and we", "63:18", "have this thing pilot these ships that", "63:21", "can defy our own physical limitations in", "63:25", "terms of what would happen to us if we", "63:27", "had to deal with you know 1 million", "63:29", "g-force because it's moving at some", "63:31", "preposterous rate through space like we", "63:34", "when we think of these things coming", "63:37", "from another planet if we think of life", "63:39", "on another planet if they can innovate", "63:42", "in a similar fashion the way we do we", "63:44", "would imagine they would create an", "63:46", "artificial creature to do all their", "63:48", "dirty work like why would they want to", "63:50", "like risk their body right yeah I mean", "63:52", "except I think creature might conjure up", "63:55", "stuff that I mean I okay the spaceship I", "63:58", "mean you don't have to have like build a", "64:00", "little thing that sits and turns the", "64:01", "steering wheel right I mean this could", "64:03", "be automated sure and you'd imagine a", "64:05", "technology that is spacefaring in a", "64:09", "serious way would have nanotechnology so", "64:11", "they have basically the ability to", "64:13", "arbitrarily configure matter in whatever", "64:17", "structure they want it out of like nano", "64:19", "scale right probes and things that could", "64:22", "shape-shift and it it's a", "64:24", "not be that that would be this person", "64:25", "sitting in a seat behind the steering", "64:27", "wheel like it would just if they wanted", "64:29", "to there could be invisible toss I'll", "64:32", "take like nano-scale things hiding in a", "64:34", "rock somewhere yes than just connecting", "64:37", "with an information link up to some", "64:39", "planetary sized computer somewhere far", "64:41", "away which would be doing that so yeah I", "64:44", "think that that's the way that space is", "64:47", "most likely to get colonized it's not", "64:50", "not going to be like with meat sacks", "64:52", "kind of driving spaceships around and", "64:54", "having Star Trek adventures it's gonna", "64:55", "be some spherical frontier emanating", "65:00", "from whatever the home planet was moving", "65:02", "at some significant fraction of the", "65:04", "speed of light and converting everything", "65:06", "in its path into infrastructure of", "65:10", "whatever type is maximally valuable for", "65:13", "that civilization maybe computers and", "65:18", "launchers to launch more of these space", "65:20", "probes so that the whole wavefront can", "65:22", "continue to propagate but we are I mean", "65:25", "one of the things you brought up earlier", "65:26", "is that if human beings are going to", "65:30", "continue and we're going to propagate", "65:32", "through the universe we're going to try", "65:35", "to go to other places we're going we're", "65:36", "going to try to populate other planets", "65:38", "and are we going to do that with just", "65:41", "robots or we're gonna try to do that", "65:43", "biologically we're probably going to try", "65:45", "to do it biologically and one of the", "65:46", "things you were saying earlier is one of", "65:47", "the things that artificial intelligence", "65:49", "could possibly do is accelerate our", "65:51", "ability to travel to other lands or the", "65:53", "plants I mean we gonna try I mean in", "65:55", "fact some people are right trying to buy", "65:57", "what I just think that's gonna not lead", "66:01", "to anything important until those", "66:04", "efforts becomes obsoleted by some", "66:07", "radical new technology wave probably", "66:11", "triggered by machine super intelligence", "66:14", "that then rapidly leads to something", "66:17", "approximating technology maturity once", "66:19", "once innovation happens at digital", "66:21", "timescales rather than human timescales", "66:22", "then all these things that you could", "66:24", "imagine we doing if I had 40,000 years", "66:27", "to work on it we would have space", "66:28", "colonies and cures for aging and yeah", "66:31", "all of these things right but if that", "66:34", "thinking time happens you know digital", "66:36", "space then that", "66:38", "future gets telescoped and i think you", "66:41", "fail to quickly reach a condition where", "66:43", "you have close to optimal technology and", "66:47", "then you can colonize the space", "66:49", "cost-effectively you just need to send", "66:51", "out one little probe that then can land", "66:54", "on some resource and set up a production", "66:56", "facility to make more probes and then it", "66:58", "spreads exponentially everywhere and", "67:01", "then if you want to you could then like", "67:03", "after that initial infrastructure has", "67:06", "happened you could transport biological", "67:09", "human beings you know the planets if you", "67:11", "want it to but it's not really where the", "67:12", "action is gonna be like but what if we", "67:14", "were concerned there's some sort of a", "67:17", "threat to the earth like some sort of", "67:21", "asteroid impact something coming that", "67:24", "stage of technology averting some", "67:26", "asteroid would be I think trivial really", "67:29", "it would be like a gift of free energy", "67:30", "like oh here comes an energy package", "67:32", "great that's a funny way to look at it", "67:35", "do you think we're gonna eventually", "67:37", "colonize Mars well I think the the the", "67:42", "answer is is this I think if and only if", "67:46", "we manage to get through these key", "67:49", "technological transitions and then I", "67:51", "think we will colonize not just Mars but", "67:55", "everything else that that is accessible", "67:58", "in the universe when you talk about", "68:00", "these things people always want to know", "68:01", "when anything's gonna happen what's the", "68:03", "time yes a mom my guess would be after", "68:05", "technological maturity like after super", "68:08", "intelligence now with Mars it's possible", "68:11", "that there would be like a little kind", "68:12", "of prototype colonization thing because", "68:15", "I like people it really excited about", "68:16", "that so if yeah so that you could", "68:18", "imagine some little demo project", "68:20", "happening sooner but if we're talking", "68:23", "about something say that would survive", "68:24", "long term even if the earth disappeared", "68:26", "like some kind of self-sustaining yeah", "68:29", "civilization I think that's gonna be", "68:31", "very difficult to do until you have", "68:35", "super intelligence and then it's gonna", "68:36", "be trivial so you think super", "68:39", "intelligence could potentially be what I", "68:42", "mean that one of the applications would", "68:44", "be to terraform Mars - yeah check out", "68:46", "the atmosphere to make it sustainable", "68:47", "for Biological life yeah you have the", "68:51", "second spot", "68:51", "yeah for example your vacation yes now I", "68:54", "also think that at this this is a very", "68:57", "radical context technology called", "68:59", "maturity because we're already maybe", "69:01", "there are additional technologies we", "69:02", "can't even think of yet but even just", "69:04", "what we already know about physics etc", "69:07", "we can sort of see possible technologies", "69:09", "that we don't yet or they were not yet", "69:11", "able to build but we can see that they", "69:12", "would be consistent with physics that", "69:14", "would be stable structures yeah and", "69:16", "already that creates a vast space of", "69:20", "things you could do and so for example I", "69:23", "think it would be possible at the", "69:26", "technological maturity to upload human", "69:28", "minds into two computers for example", "69:31", "yeah and so that you think that's gonna", "69:32", "happen like Ray Kurzweil stuff well I", "69:34", "think again it would be technically", "69:36", "possible at technical maturity to do it", "69:39", "mmm-hmm", "69:40", "now whether it's actually going to", "69:42", "happen then depends a do we reach", "69:43", "technological maturity and B do we are", "69:47", "we interested in using our technology", "69:49", "for that purpose at that time but if", "69:54", "both of those same kind of reasonably", "69:57", "possible", "69:58", "yeah reasonably possible in most of all", "70:01", "and especially in comparison what we've", "70:03", "already achieved if if I had a time", "70:05", "machine", "70:06", "and it could jump you 1,000 years from", "70:09", "now into the future would you do it", "70:12", "would you jump in I mean I think you", "70:16", "like the skies right now along yet", "70:19", "flight this kind of already in Mianus", "70:22", "what it was an instantaneous could I", "70:25", "come back no well I probably wouldn't I", "70:32", "don't know I mean I'm kind of a bit", "70:37", "cautious with these things but at least", "70:39", "at very least I'd want to think about it", "70:41", "for a long time before it'll be also I", "70:43", "have been attachments over there people", "70:45", "I care about here and projects and maybe", "70:48", "even opportunities to try to make some", "70:49", "difference if if we actually are in this", "70:51", "weird time right now different from all", "70:54", "of earlier human history were nothing", "70:56", "really much was happening and we're not", "70:58", "yet where it's all out of our hands and", "71:00", "it's super intelligence is running the", "71:01", "show well if that actually is if that's", "71:05", "true then that means we right now living", "71:08", "this very weird period where our actions", "71:10", "might have cosmological consequences if", "71:13", "we if we affect the precise time and way", "71:16", "in which the transitions in machine", "71:19", "superintelligence happens we would be", "71:20", "hugely influential and you know if you", "71:24", "have some ambition to try to do", "71:27", "something good in the world and that", "71:29", "kind of can be a very exciting prospect", "71:32", "as well like there might be no other", "71:34", "better time to exist if your goal is to", "71:36", "do good we might be in the golden years", "71:39", "for in in terms of ability to have to", "71:43", "take actions that have large", "71:44", "consequences also this very unique", "71:46", "transitionary period between the times", "71:49", "of old and the times of new like we're", "71:51", "really in the heat of the change in", "71:54", "terms of like we you know the internet", "71:56", "is only 20 plus years old phones are", "72:00", "only you know cell phones at least", "72:02", "people carrying them all the time it's", "72:04", "only 15 plus years old this is very very", "72:07", "new okay yeah so it's an exciting crazy", "72:11", "time where all these changes are taking", "72:12", "place really rapidly like if you were", "72:15", "from the future this might be the place", "72:18", "where you would travel to to experience", "72:20", "what it was like to see this immense", "72:22", "change take place almost instantaneously", "72:25", "like if you could go back in time to a", "72:27", "specific time in history and experience", "72:30", "what life was like to me I think I'd", "72:32", "probably pick ancient Egypt like during", "72:35", "the the days of the Pharaohs I would", "72:36", "love to see you get to choose who we are", "72:39", "just watch yes I'm watching just to see", "72:42", "what it looks like you know what it's", "72:43", "like to experience life back then but if", "72:47", "I was from the future were things what", "72:49", "what just a curious idea what do you", "72:51", "think it would look like like what what", "72:53", "do you imagine yourself seeing in this I", "72:54", "would imagine I would I mean I've really", "72:58", "thought long and hard about the", "73:01", "construction method the construction", "73:03", "methods of ancient Egypt I would love to", "73:05", "see what it looked like when they were", "73:08", "building the pyramids like how long did", "73:10", "it take what were they doing like how", "73:13", "did they do it we saw no it's all really", "73:15", "theoretical there's all these ideas of", "73:17", "how they constructed", "73:19", "with incredible precision and you know", "73:21", "precision in terms of the way it's", "73:24", "astronomically aligned to certain areas", "73:26", "of our solar system and different", "73:28", "constellations it's amazing I would love", "73:31", "to have seen how they did that and what", "73:34", "was the planning like and had they", "73:36", "implemented and how many people did it", "73:38", "take and how long did it take because we", "73:40", "really I don't know it's all speculation", "73:42", "dude think the burning of the Library of", "73:44", "Alexandria we lost so much information", "73:46", "and we've got you know hieroglyphs and", "73:49", "the physical structures that are still", "73:51", "daunting we have no idea we look at", "73:52", "those like we they look at the Great", "73:54", "Pyramid of Giza the the the huge one", "73:58", "with two million plus stones in it like", "74:01", "who made that how how'd you guys do it I", "74:03", "mean what what did you did you draw it", "74:07", "out first like well how did you get all", "74:09", "the rocks there like I mean I think that", "74:11", "would be probably the spot that I would", "74:14", "want to go to I would want to be there", "74:16", "in the middle of the construction of the", "74:17", "pyramids just to watch justice so that", "74:19", "certainly would be big like I guess", "74:21", "tourist destinations from for travelers", "74:24", "yeah in terms of if one is thinking I'm", "74:27", "just saying what was going on back then", "74:29", "we think the pyramids and that the slave", "74:32", "trains and dialogue but of course for", "74:34", "most Egyptians most of the time that", "74:36", "would be picking weeds from their field", "74:37", "or sure I think they're very to sleep", "74:39", "for just like stuff like that yeah so",

maturity", "81:08", "well say having developed at least all", "81:11", "those technologies that we already have", "81:13", "good reason to think are physically", "81:15", "possible so that would include the", "81:18", "technology to build extremely large and", "81:21", "powerful computers on which you could", "81:24", "run detailed computer simulations of", "81:27", "conscious individuals so that that kind", "81:33", "of kind of would be a pessimistic height", "81:35", "like if that's if if almost all", "81:37", "civilizations is our stage failed to get", "81:40", "there that's bad news right because then", "81:43", "we'll fail as well almost certainly", "81:44", "that's one possible yeah so that's", "81:47", "option one option two is that there is a", "81:50", "very strong convergence among all", "81:53", "technologically mature civilizations in", "81:56", "that they all lose interest in creating", "81:58", "ancestor simulations or these kinds of", "82:01", "detailed computer simulations of", "82:03", "conscious people like their historical", "82:05", "predecessors or variations so maybe they", "82:08", "have all of these computers that could", "82:09", "do it but for whatever reason", "82:11", "they all decide not to do it maybe", "82:13", "there's an ethical imperative not to do", "82:15", "it or some other I mean we don't really", "82:17", "know much about these posthuman", "82:19", "creatures and what they want to do and", "82:21", "don't want to do so host human well I'd", "82:23", "imagine that by the time they have the", "82:25", "technology to do this yes they would", "82:27", "also have enhanced themselves in many", "82:29", "different ways right and so perhaps", "82:31", "enhancing their ability to recognize the", "82:33", "consequences yeah of creating yeah that", "82:37", "would almost certainly have cognitively", "82:38", "enhanced themselves for example well is", "82:40", "the concept of downloading consciousness", "82:43", "into a

once it's contained into this", "82:53", "computer when what it what is what's to", "82:56", "stop it from existing there as long as", "82:59", "there's power and as long as these chips", "83:03", "are firing and electricity is being", "83:05", "transferred data's being moved back and", "83:08", "forth you would essentially be in some", "83:11", "sort of a simulation well I mean if you",

otherwise it's not going to", "83:23", "know what to do right yeah so so so we", "83:29", "have these kind of virtual reality", "83:30", "environments now that are imperfect but", "83:32", "improving yeah and you could kind of", "83:34", "mean imagine that they get better and", "83:36", "better and then you'll have a perfect", "83:37", "virtual reality environment but imagine", "83:40", "also that

"matrix well I think in the matrix there", "83:51", "are biological humans outside that plug", "83:53", "in right right but if you could include", "83:58", "in the simulation just as you have maybe", "84:00", "simulated coffee mugs and cars and", "84:02", "cetera you could have simulated brains", "84:04", "that if and and so it here is one", "84:09", "assumption coming in from outside the",

than the material that", "84:40", "is used to underpin it so in that case", "84:43", "you could have a simulation with", "84:45", "detailed simulations of brains in it", "84:47", "where maybe every

posthumous just are not at all", "84:59", "interested in doing it and not just that", "85:02", "some of them don't they would like of", "85:03", "all these civilizations that reach", "85:05", "technology maturity that is kind of", "85:06", "pretty uniformly just don't do that and", "85:09", "what's number three that we are in a", "85:11", "simulation the simulation hypothesis and", "85:13", "we're you lean well I I generally had to", "85:18", "punt on the question of precise", "85:20", "probabilities there I mean I think it", "85:22", "would be a probability thing right yes", "85:24", "it assigns some to each but yeah I've", "85:28", "refrained from giving a very precise", "85:30", "number part partly because I mean if I", "85:33", "said some particular number it would get", "85:35", "colder and it would create this maybe", "85:37", "sense of false precision mm-hm", "85:39", "the argument doesn't allow you to derive", "85:42", "this the probabilities XYZ it's just", "85:45", "that at least one of these three has to", "85:47", "obtain so yeah so that that narrows it", "85:52", "down", "85:52", "not because you might think you know", "85:54", "what do we know the future is big you", "85:56", "could just make up any story and we have", "85:58", "no evidence for but but it seems that", "86:00", "there actually if you start to think", "86:01", "everything through quite tight", "86:02", "constraints on what probabilistically", "86:06", "coherent views you could have and it's", "86:08", "kind of hard even to find one overall", "86:10", "hypothesis that fits this and and", "86:13", "various other considerations that that", "86:16", "we think we know the idea would be that", "86:18", "if there is one day the ability to", "86:22", "create a simulation that it would be", "86:24", "indiscernible from reality itself that", "86:27", "if like say if we are not in a", "86:29", "simulation yet if this is just", "86:30", "biological life we're just extremely", "86:32", "fortunate to be in this Goldilocks", "86:34", "period but we're working", "86:37", "on virtual reality in terms of like", "86:39", "oculus and all these companies are", "86:41", "creating these consumer based virtual", "86:44", "reality things that are getting better", "86:45", "and better and really kind of", "86:46", "interesting that you gotta imagine that", "86:48", "twenty years ago there was nothing like", "86:50", "that", "86:50", "twenty years from now it might be", "86:52", "indiscernible you might you might be", "86:55", "able to create a virtual reality that's", "86:58", "impossible to to discern from the", "87:02", "reality that we're currently experienced", "87:04", "or are maybe twenty thousand years at 20", "87:06", "million years like the the argument",

"87:17", "experiences and even feedback in terms", "87:20", "of like biological feedback touch and", "87:22", "feel and smell if they figure out a way", "87:25", "to do that one day they will have an", "87:28", "artificial reality that's indiscernible", "87:30", "from reality itself and if that is the", "87:32", "case how do we know if we're in it right", "87:35", "that that is roughly the gist of it now", "87:40", "as I said I think if you simulate the", "87:43", "brain also you have a cheaper overall", "87:47", "system then if you have a biological", "87:50", "component in the center it was", "87:52", "surrounded by a virtual reality gear and", "87:56", "so you could for a given cost I think", "87:59", "create many more ancestor simulations", "88:02", "with simulated brains in the rather than", "88:04", "biological brains with VR gear so most", "88:08", "in indie snorers where there would be a", "88:09", "lot of simulations most of those nars", "88:11", "which would be the the

terms mind Fox when you", "88:28", "really stop and think about reality", "88:29", "itself that if we are living in a", "88:31", "simulation like what what is it and why", "88:34", "and where does it go", "88:36", "and how do I respond how do I move", "88:41", "forward if I really do believe this is a", "88:43", "simulation what am I doing here yeah", "88:45", "those are big questions huge questions", "88:49", "not some of them arise Eve", "88:51", "if we're not in a simulation yeah and", "88:54", "aren't there people that have done some", "88:57", "strange impossible understand",

relevant you have no idea of", "90:57", "knowing whether they're even or atoms", "90:58", "Terra now you could take a big electron", "91:02", "microscope", "91:04", "and look at finer structure and then", "91:07", "then you could take an atomic force", "91:08", "microscope and you could see individual", "91:10", "atoms even and you could perform all", "91:11", "kinds of measurements and it might be", "91:14", "important that if you did that you", "91:16", "wouldn't see anything weird because", "91:17", "physicists do these experiments and they", "91:19", "don't see anything weird but then you", "91:20", "could kind of fill in those details like", "91:22", "if and when somebody were performing", "91:24", "those experiments that would be vastly", "91:26", "cheaper than continuously

you if you do stop and think I", "92:08", "think we're in simulation what what are", "92:10", "the things that are convincing to you", "92:13", "well it would mainly go through the the", "92:15", "simulation argument that if it had", "92:17", "extended I think the alternative two", "92:19", "hypotheses are improbable then that", "92:22", "would kind of shift the probability mass", "92:24", "on the third remaining is it really only", "92:26", "three so the Intel the ones are we that", "92:30", "human beings go extinct well and other", "92:33", "civilizations at our stage in the cosmos", "92:36", "or whatever yes hey this is strong yeah", "92:39", "strong filter that they either go", "92:41", "extinct or they decide not to pursue all", "92:44", "this interest yeah or it becomes a", "92:45", "simulation this is that really the only", "92:47", "think the only three live options now so", "92:49", "you can IIIi can kind of unfold the", "92:53", "argument a little bit more and look more", "92:55", "granular so suppose that the first two", "92:57", "options are false", "92:59", "so some non-trivial fraction of", "93:01", "civilizations at our stage do get", "93:03", "through and some non-trivial fraction of", "93:06", "those are still interested then I think", "93:11", "you can convincingly show that by using", "93:14", "just a small portion of the resources", "93:16", "they could create", "93:17", "very many simulations and you can show", "93:22", "that or argue for that by comparing the", "93:24", "computational power of systems that we", "93:27", "know are physically possible to build we", "93:31", "can't currently build them but we could", "93:32", "see that you could build them with", "93:33", "nanotech and if you have planetary sized", "93:35", "you know resources on the one hand and", "93:38", "on the other hand estimates of how much", "93:40", "compute power it would take to simulate", "93:42", "a human brain and you find that a mature", "93:47", "civilization would have many many orders", "93:49", "of magnitude more so that even if they", "93:50", "just used one percent of their compute", "93:53", "power of one planet for one minute they", "93:56", "could still run you know thousands and", "93:58", "thousands and thousands of these", "93:59", "simulations and and they might have", "94:01", "billions of planets and they might last", "94:03", "for billions of here so so the numbers", "94:05", "are quite extreme it seems so then then", "94:08", "what you get is this implication that if", "94:11", "the first two options are false it would", "94:15", "follow that there would be many many", "94:17", "more simulated experiences of our kind", "94:21", "and that would be original experiences", "94:23", "of our account so the idea is

no no I mean the", "94:38", "second might be that we decide not and", "94:41", "others with the same capability but what", "94:43", "if they don't decide not to what if they", "94:45", "don't decide to not to if we the first", "94:49", "option if human beings do figure out a", "94:52", "way to not die and stay stay innovative", "94:56", "and we don't have any sort of natural", "94:58", "disasters

they have the capacity then", "95:28", "they will do it and the motive", "95:31", "desire to yeah so that then they would", "95:34", "they create hugely many of these so not", "95:38", "just one simulation right but because", "95:40", "it's so cheap at the technological", "95:41", "maturity if you have a cosmic Empire of", "95:43", "resources it it doesn't have to have a", "95:47", "very big desire to do this they might", "95:49", "just think well you know well that was", "95:52", "the big question that Ilan said he would", "95:53", "ask artificial intelligence said what's", "95:55", "beyond the simulation okay that's the", "95:58", "real question if this is a simulation if", "96:01", "there's many many simulations running", "96:03", "currently what's beyond the simulation", "96:06", "well yeah you might be curious about", "96:08", "that I mean I think the more important", "96:10", "question would be like what do we all", "96:12", "things considered have the most recent", "96:15", "to do in our situation like what would", "96:17", "it be wise for us to do is that like", "96:19", "some way that we can be helpful or have", "96:24", "the best life or whatever is ridiculous", "96:27", "to even consider maybe it's beyond us", "96:30", "what the question of what is outside yes", "96:33", "well I mean I don't think it's", "96:37", "ridiculous to consider I think it might", "96:39", "be beyond us but maybe we would be able", "96:41", "to form some abstract conception of what", "96:44", "it is I mean in fact if if we if there", "96:46", "is the path to believing the simulation", "96:48", "hypothesis is the simulation argument", "96:50", "and I mean we have a bunch of structure", "96:52", "there that gives us some idea like that", "96:54", "would be some advanced civilization that", "96:57", "they would have developed a lot of", "97:00", "technology over time including computer", "97:03", "technology ability to do virtual reality", "97:06", "very well we'd imagine probably they", "97:09", "would have used that technology for a", "97:10", "whole host of other purposes as well you", "97:12", "wouldn't just get that technology and", "97:14", "you know not be able to create a train", "97:16", "or something like I said okay they'd", "97:19", "probably be super intelligence and have", "97:21", "the ability to colonize the universe and", "97:23",

think that fundamentally", "97:46", "our ability to crack this whole thing", "97:49", "would be very limited and there might be", "97:53", "other considerations that we are", "97:56", "oblivious to that would I mean if you", "97:58", "think about the simulation argument is", "98:01", "it quite recent right so it's like it's", "98:03", "only it's less than 20 years old sorry", "98:06", "if you think that suppose it's correct", "98:09", "for the sake of argument then up to this", "98:10", "point everybody was missing something", "98:12", "like hugely important and fundamental", "98:14",

"figured out the last big missing piece", "98:25", "presumably that must be some father big", "98:29", "giant realization that is like beyond", "98:32", "those currently so I think having some", "98:34", "yeah I mean that that looks kind of", "98:36", "possible but maybe there are further big", "98:39", "discoveries or revelations that that", "98:41", "would kind of maybe not falsify the", "98:43", "simulation but maybe change the", "98:44", "interpretation like do something that is", "98:46", "hard to know in advance what that would", "98:48", "be now is the concept that if there is a", "98:50", "simulation that all the historical", "98:52", "record is simulated as well well or when", "98:56", "did it take in well this is their", "98:58", "different options there right and there", "98:59", "might be many different simulations that", "99:02", "configure differently that could be once", "99:05", "that run for a very long time once that", "99:07", "run for a short period of time once that", "99:09", "simulate everything and everybody others", "99:11", "that just focus on some particular scene", "99:14", "or person you could like just a vast", "99:16", "space of possibilities there and which", "99:20", "ones of those would be most likely it's", "99:21", "really hard to save much about because", "99:24", "it would depend on the reasons for", "99:25", "creating these simulations like what", "99:27", "would the interests of these", "99:28", "hypothetical post-humans be", "99:30", "have you ever had a conversation with a", "99:32", "pragmatic capable person who really", "99:34", "understands what you're saying and but", "99:36", "they disagree about the even the", "99:40", "possibility of a simulation and it must", "99:46", "have occurred but it doesn't tend to be", "99:48", "the place where the conversation usually", "99:51", "goes the conversation usually go", "99:56", "I mean III mean I move in kind of", "99:59", "unrepresentative circles so I think", "100:01", "amongst the folk I interact with a lot I", "100:04", "think a common reaction is that it's", "100:06", "possible and still there is some", "100:10", "uncertainty because these things are", "100:13", "always hard to figure out but we should", "100:17", "assign it some probability but I'm not", "100:22", "saying that would be the typical", "100:23", "reaction if you kind of did a Gallup", "100:25", "survey or something like that", "100:28", "I mean another common thing is I guess", "100:30", "too", "100:32", "miss interpreted in some way or another", "100:37", "and there are different versions of that", "100:41", "so one would be this idea that in order", "100:44", "for the simulation hypothesis to be true", "100:46", "it has to be possible to simulate", "100:48", "everything around us to perfect", "100:51", "microscopic detail which we discussed", "100:54", "earlier right then some people might not", "100:59", "immediately get this idea that the brain", "101:01", "itself could be part of the simulation", "101:03", "so they imagined it would be plugged in", "101:05", "with like a big cable and if you just", "101:07", "somehow could reach behind you and like", "101:09", "that would be so that that would be", "101:11", "another possible common misconception I", "101:15", "guess then I think common thing is to", "101:23", "conflate this simulation hypothesis with", "101:25", "the simulation argument that the", "101:28", "simulation hypothesis is we are in a", "101:30", "simulation the argument is that one of", "101:32", "these three options is true only one of", "101:34", "which is the simulation hypothesis so", "101:37", "like some conflation there happens how", "101:40", "do you factor dreams into the simulation", "101:42", "hypothesis well I think they are", "101:44", "irrelevant to it that is that whether or", "101:47", "not we are in a simulation people", "101:51", "presumably would still have dreams and", "101:52", "other reasons and explanations for what", "101:56", "that's what happened so our aims even if", "101:58", "you're in the simulation why not so some", "102:05", "people so I sometimes get these kind of", "102:08", "random email from coders that like", "102:12", "that's like oh well you know yes thank", "102:14", "you us from our theories very", "102:17", "interesting and I found proof and like", "102:19", "hall when I looked in my bathroom mirror", "102:21", "I saw pixels like the random things like", "102:24", "there is people varying degrees I mean", "102:27", "maybe we're all crazy", "102:28", "but yeah but I think that those things", "102:30", "are not evidence in generally speaking", "102:32", "you would expect if we're not in a", "102:36", "simulation there still to be various", "102:38", "people who claim to perceive various", "102:41", "things sometimes people have a loose", "102:42", "nation sometimes to misremember", "102:43", "sometimes to make stuff up like you just", "102:45", "imagine", "102:46", "would be so the most likely explanation", "102:48", "for those things is not even even if you", "102:51", "are in a simulation the most likely", "102:52", "explanation for those thing is not that", "102:54", "it was a glitch in the simulation is", "102:55", "that one of these normal psychological", "102:57", "phenomenon took place right so yeah I", "103:00", "would not be inclined to think that this", "103:04", "would be an explanation if somebody has", "103:06", "those kind of experiences it's probably", "103:09", "not because we are innocent even if the", "103:11", "simulation hypothesis is true it's", "103:12", "probably not the explanation the concept", "103:16", "of creativity how does that play into a", "103:19", "simulation if you're if during the", "103:21", "simulation you're coming up with these", "103:23", "unique creative thoughts are these", "103:26", "unique creative thoughts your own or", "103:28", "these unique creative thoughts", "103:30", "stimulated by the simulation and I think", "103:33", "they could that would be our own in the", "103:35", "sense that it would be our brain that", "103:37", "was producing them something else would", "103:39", "have produced your brain but obviously", "103:41", "there's some incredible influences on", "103:42", "your brain if you're involved in some", "103:44", "sort of an external stimulation that's", "103:47", "true in physical reality as well sure so", "103:50", "it's like not know but it's still your", "103:53", "brain I think it would be as much", "103:56", "potentially as much your own in the", "103:58", "simulation as it would be outside the", "104:00", "simulation I mean unless the simulators", "104:03", "had for whatever reason set it up with", "104:07", "the view that they for some reason they", "104:11", "just wanted to have all this is wrong", "104:12", "and coming up with this particular idea", "104:14", "and I've kind of configured the initial", "104:15", "conditions and just the right way to", "104:16", "achieve that maybe then when you come up", "104:19", "with it maybe it's less your achievement", "104:22", "than the people who set up the initial", "104:23", "conditions but other than that I think", "104:27", "kind of be similar in because the reason", "104:29", "I asked that is all ideas but everything", "104:33", "that gets created all innovation", "104:35", "initially comes from some sort of a", "104:36", "point of someone figuring something out", "104:38", "or coming up with a creative idea all of", "104:41", "it like everything they see in the", "104:43", "external world like everything from", "104:44", "televisions to automobiles was an idea", "104:47", "and then somebody implemented that idea", "104:49", "or groups of people implemented the", "104:51", "technology involved in that idea and", "104:53", "then eventually it came to fruition if", "104:54", "you're in a simulation how much of that", "104:59", "is being", "105:00", "externally introduced into your", "105:02", "consciousness by the simulation and is", "105:05", "it pushing inhalation in a certain jury", "105:08", "I don't know I mean you could imagine", "105:09", "both kinds of simulations like", "105:11", "simulations where you just set up the", "105:12", "initial conditions and let it run to see", "105:14", "what happens right and others where", "105:17", "maybe you want to just simulate this / -", "105:20", "you like this particular historical", "105:21", "counterfactual like what would have", "105:24", "happened like if Napoleon had been", "105:28", "defeated like maybe that's our", "105:29", "simulation but in some specific thing", "105:31", "there you could imagine either or both", "105:33", "of those types of ways of doing it but", "105:37", "your simulation hypothesis we if we're", "105:43", "in it it's running now is it running and", "105:48", "we independently interact with the", "105:52", "simulation or is the simulation", "105:54", "introducing ideas into our minds that", "105:59", "then come to fruition inside the", "106:01", "simulation is that how things get done", "106:04", "like if we are in a simulation right and", "106:07", "if during the simulation someone has", "106:08", "created a new iPhone like why are they", "106:12", "doing that if other other people in the", "106:14", "simulation or is this simulation", "106:16", "entirely unique to the individual is", "106:19", "each individual involved in a different", "106:23", "coexisting simulation right so they the", "106:29", "I think the the kind of simulation that", "106:33", "it would be clearest the clearest case", "106:36", "for why that would be possible would be", "106:37", "one where all people would be simulated", "106:40", "that you proceed and for each brain yeah", "106:43", "that is it because then you could get", "106:45", "the realistic behavior out of the brain", "106:47", "if you simulated a whole brain at the", "106:50", "sufficient level of detail so everyone", "106:53", "you interact with is also acceleration", "106:55", "well that that type of simulation should", "106:57", "certainly be possible then it's more of", "106:59", "an open question whether it would also", "107:01", "be possible to create simulations where", "107:04", "there was say only one person conscious", "107:06", "and the others were just like simulacra", "107:11", "yeah I like that I like the", "107:13", "acted like humans but there's nothing", "107:15", "inside right so these would be in", "107:18", "philosopher's parlance zombies that is", "107:21", "like a technical term but it means in in", "107:23", "one philosophers discuss it's somebody", "107:25", "who acts exactly like a human but with", "107:27", "no conscious experience now whether", "107:29", "those things are possible or not is an", "107:31", "open and question do you consider that", "107:34", "every when you're communicating with", "107:35", "people they ever stop denying like this", "107:37", "every day I mean as a card to me but not", "107:40", "not not regular I don't know yeah does", "107:43", "it that but if it does it ever get your", "107:44", "head were you like this might not be", "107:47", "real like this person might not be a", "107:52", "real person this might be a simulation", "107:54", "right I mean I guess there two things to", "107:57", "be says one is that you'd probably have", "108:00", "some probability distribution over all", "108:02", "these different kinds of situations that", "108:04", "you could be in maybe all of those", "108:07", "situations are simulated in different", "108:09", "frequencies and stuff different numbers", "108:13", "of times that is so there would be some", "108:16", "probability distribution there that", "108:17", "would be the first thought that in", "108:20", "reality are always kind of uncertain the", "108:22", "second would be that even if you were in", "108:25", "that kind of simulation it might still", "108:27", "be that behaviorally what you should do", "108:29", "is exactly the same as if you were in", "108:31", "the other simulation so it might not", "108:35", "have that much day-to-day implications", "108:40", "do you think there's psychological", "108:42", "benefits for interacting with life as if", "108:44", "it's a simulation from no I don't think", "108:47", "that would be an advantage I mean maybe", "108:48", "maybe this in some case re what an", "108:51", "alleviation of existential a maybe but", "108:54", "who knows if it could also I guess if if", "108:59", "you sort of interpreted in the wrong way", "109:04", "maybe lead you to feel more alienated or", "109:06", "something like that I don't know but I", "109:09", "think to a first approximation the same", "109:12", "things that would be work well and make", "109:16", "a lot of sense to do in in physical", "109:18", "reality would be also our best bets in a", "109:21", "simulated reality that's where it gets", "109:25", "really weird", "109:26", "like if it's a simulation but you must", "109:31", "behave in each and every instance as if", "109:35", "it's not if you know if you were given a", "109:38", "you like if you had a test you could", "109:40", "take like a pregnancy test when you went", "109:43", "to the CVS and you know you you pee on a", "109:46", "strip I tells you guess what Nick this", "109:50", "shit isn't real you're in a simulation a", "109:53", "hundred percent proven absolutely", "109:55", "positive you know from now on from this", "109:58", "moment on that everything you interact", "110:00", "with is some sort of a creation it's not", "110:04", "real but it is real because you're", "110:07", "having the same exact experience as if", "110:09", "it was real why you proceed um yeah I I", "110:15", "think that might be very subtle", "110:17", "reprioritization that that would happen", "110:19", "what would you do but personally well I", "110:24", "I don't know the full answer to that I", "110:27", "think there are certain possibilities", "110:28", "that look kind of far-fetched if we are", "110:33", "not in the simulation that become like", "110:35", "more realistic if we are like I mean so", "110:38", "so what one obvious one it's like if in", "110:40", "simulation could be shut off like if the", "110:43", "computer where the simulation is running", "110:45", "is if the plug is pong right right and", "110:48", "so we think physical universe has been", "110:50", "normal and I said it can't just suddenly", "110:51", "pop out of existence there's a", "110:52", "conservation of energy and momentum and", "110:54", "so forth but a simulated universe that", "110:57", "that seems like something that could", "110:58", "happen it doesn't mean it is likely to", "111:01", "happen or it doesn't say anything about", "111:02", "what time frame but at least these like", "111:04", "interests as a possibility where it was", "111:06", "not there before other things as well", "111:08", "become more maybe similar to various", "111:11", "theological possibilities that like", "111:14", "afterlife and stuff like that and in", "111:16", "fact it kind of maybe through a very", "111:19", "different path leads to some similar", "111:24", "destinations as as as people through", "111:28", "thinking about theology and stuff have", "111:31", "arrived at in that that would mean it's", "111:36", "kind of different I think there is no", "111:38", "logically necessary connection you", "111:40", "but there are some kind of structural", "111:43", "parallels analogs between the situation", "111:46", "of a simulated creature - there you know", "111:49", "simulators and and I created entity to", "111:53", "their crater that that are interesting", "111:57", "although kind of different so so that", "112:01", "might be kind of comparisons there that", "112:03", "you could make that would give you some", "112:05", "like possible ways of proceeding it", "112:08", "seems like paralysis by analysis so you", "112:10", "just sit there and think about it like", "112:12", "at least I would yeah I would almost", "112:15", "wind up not being able to do anything or", "112:18", "not being able to act or move or think", "112:19", "wow that that seems kind of likely to be", "112:21", "suboptimal right sub-optimal for sure", "112:24", "yeah so yeah but it's uh the the concept", "112:28", "is so prevalent and it's so common and", "112:31", "it's interesting how much it has just", "112:33", "over the last yeah 10 15 years how long", "112:37", "the idea has what's this like really", "112:40", "radical thing when it started and I know", "112:42", "you have all these kind of figures that", "112:43", "kind of almost like in on Poisson just", "112:47", "kind of yeah throws it off and yeah I I", "112:50", "it's interesting how ideas can migrate", "112:52", "from some kind of extreme radical fringe", "112:56", "and some like decade or two later", "112:58", "they're just kind of almost common sense", "113:00", "nothing that is well we have a great", "113:04", "ability to get used to things I mean", "113:05", "this comes back to our discussion about", "113:08", "the pace of technological progress it", "113:10", "seems like the normal way for things to", "113:11", "be we are very adaptable creatures right", "113:14", "you can adjust to almost everything and", "113:17", "we have no kind of external reference", "113:20", "point really and mostly these judgments", "113:24", "are based on what we think other people", "113:27", "think so if it looks like if some high", "113:30", "status individual Elon Musk or whatever", "113:32", "talk seems to take the simulation", "113:34", "argument seriously then people think", "113:35", "it's a sensible idea and it only takes", "113:39", "like one or two or three of those like", "113:41", "people that that that are highly", "113:44", "regarded and suddenly it becomes", "113:45", "normalized is there any one highly", "113:48", "regarded that openly dismisses as", "113:50", "possibility that must be but I'm not", "113:53", "sure they would", "113:54", "bothered to go on the record", "113:57", "specifically like I guess the people who", "113:59", "are dismissive of it wouldn't maybe even", "114:01", "bother to address it there was something", "114:05", "um trying to think yeah and I'm drawing", "114:08", "a blank of whether there's a specific", "114:09", "particular person I could I would love",

in", "114:20", "for I these ideas yeah that could be", "114:25", "interesting yeah you see you've never", "114:27", "had like some sort of a debate with", "114:28", "someone openly dismisses well like a big", "114:32", "public debate I don't know even private", "114:34", "yeah I don't know I mean I've it was", "114:37", "kind of a long time since I when I first", "114:40", "put this article out I I guess I had", "114:44", "more conversations about the argument", "114:47", "itself what was the reaction when you", "114:48", "first put it out there's a lot of", "114:50", "attention right I mean pretty much right", "114:52", "off the bat including public it I mean", "114:54", "it was published in some academic", "114:56", "journal philosophical quarterly but yeah", "114:59", "it quickly drew a lot of a ton and then", "115:04", "it's kind of come in waves like every", "115:06", "other every year or so this tip should", "115:08", "be like some new group of something you", "115:10", "either a new generation or some new", "115:12", "community that hears about it for the", "115:14", "first time and it kind of gets a new", "115:16", "wave of attention but in parallel to", "115:21", "these

it", "124:48", "have to be there in a simulation and not", "124:50", "be there in reality well I mean it could", "124:53", "be there in the simulation if it's a", "124:55", "kind of simulation the original yeah if", "124:58", "it's a fantasy simulation then you know", "125:00", "maybe it wouldn't be there right but it", "125:02", "could", "125:03", "be reality it doesn't have to be a sign",

big", "126:35", "window pops up in front of you saying", "126:37", "you're in the simulation more inclusive", "126:40", "right yes right so short of that you", "126:45", "would have weaker

"128:17", "ourselves and as we move towards the big", "128:20", "button to sort of initiate this like", "128:22", "then the probability of the first two", "128:24", "hypotheses basically goes to zero and", "128:29", "then we would have to conclude with near", "128:31", "certainty that we are ourselves in a", "128:33", "simulation as we push this button to", "128:35", "create a million simulations

"128:55", "rogon experiences is the present one we", "129:01", "just can't tell from the inside which", "129:03", "one it is yeah I mean if if you had if", "129:06", "you could see like some objective clock", "129:08", "and and say that well as as yet the", "129:12", "clock is so early that no simulations", "129:15", "have happened and obviously you could", "129:16", "conclude that you're in the

and then I'd say we", "129:28", "have no way of telling which of the", "129:29", "different instances we are and one of", "129:32", "them might be that there is no", "129:33", "simulation and that

could potentially take", "130:21", "place but has not yet isn't that also a", "130:24", "possibility yeah yeah let me sure it's", "130:26", "just a question of how probable that is", "130:28", "given the why isn't it super probable", "130:29", "because we're experiencing it well I", "130:31", "mean it would be a very unusual", "130:33", "situation for somebody with your", "130:35", "experiences to be in what about your", "130:37", "experiences for my expressively the same", "130:39", "same there yeah it would be extremely", "130:42", "unusual but there's your seven billion", "130:43", "unusual expression taneous lee but i", "130:46", "would you see me think there were like", "130:49", "say a million simulations right then you", "130:52", "know that would be a million times more", "130:55", "but why would there be any simulations", "130:57", "why would there not just be 7 billion", "130:58", "people experiencing life right yeah that", "131:01", "mean then that would have to be", "131:03", "something that prevents these", "131:04", "simulations from furthering create this", "131:07", "is where you lose me yeah so I think", "131:08", "maybe the difference is I tend to think", "131:10", "in terms of the world as a four", "131:14", "dimensional structure with time being", "131:18", "one dimension right okay I'm sorry just", "131:19", "so you think in the totality of",

if I", "132:00", "understand your no no my option is that", "132:02", "nothing's happened yet yeah but they", "132:04", "will have been maybe but not yet right", "132:08", "but it's all I understand your option is", "132:10", "that if you look at the universe at the", "132:12", "end of time and we'll look back that", "132:14", "would be a lot of simulated versions of", "132:16", "you and then one already know long", "132:17", "that's a think you might be the original", "132:20", "one no I'm not even considering that", "132:21", "what I'm saying is we may just be here", "132:26", "that there is no simulation and that", "132:29", "maybe it will take place but maybe it", "132:33", "will not right but you have to pick", "132:35", "which of those versions you are which of", "132:38", "those scenarios you are considering that", "132:40", "is the there is the scenario I'm", "132:42", "considering the scenario I'm considering", "132:44", "is we are just here we are actually a", "132:46", "lot", "132:46", "what happens after like so I want this", "132:48", "in order to say what happened in the", "132:50", "past what happens now and what will", "132:52", "happen in the future well we don't", "132:53", "always going to happen in the future", "132:55", "right that's that's right so we can", "132:56", "consider both options right yes", "132:58", "one option where there are no", "133:00", "simulations created later right then I", "133:04", "would say that means one of the first", "133:07", "two alternatives but another option is", "133:09", "there could be a simulation created", "133:11", "later but it has not taken place that", "133:13", "there will be simulation is later is", "133:16", "that it's a possibility but it has not", "133:18", "happened right but that there will be", "133:19", "later that's that's one possibility and", "133:21", "so then I say if that's the world that", "133:25", "we are looking at then most experiences", "133:31", "of your kind exist inside the simulation", "133:35", "I still don't understand that why can it", "133:39", "not have happened yet well it could", "133:43", "depends on which of these experiences is", "133:46", "your present moment in that scenario", "133:49", "right so that there's going to be a", "133:51", "million of them plus an initial one you", "133:55", "can tell from", "133:56", "maybe there will be a million of them", "133:59", "but there's right now no evidence that", "134:02", "there's going to be no evidence that", "134:04", "there is no evidence that it's ever even", "134:07", "going to be possible technologically we", "134:09", "think there could be but it hasn't", "134:11", "happened yet so why would you assume", "134:13", "that we are in a simulation currently", "134:16", "when there's no evidence whatsoever that", "134:18", "it's even possible to create a", "134:19", "simulation maybe there is some", "134:24", "alternative way of trying to explain I", "134:28", "understand I'm taking like suppose I'm", "134:33", "sorry", "134:35", "I'm just thinking maybe we could think", "134:36", "of some simpler thought experiment which", "134:39", "has nothing to do with simulations and", "134:41", "stuff but imagine if I'm making this up", "134:47", "as I go along so we'll see if it", "134:48", "actually works but you are taking into a", "134:53", "room and then you're awake there for one", "134:58", "hour and then a coin is tossed and if it", "135:05", "lands heads then the experiment ends and", "135:07", "you exit the room and everything is", "135:09", "normal again but if it lands tails then", "135:12", "you're given an amnesia drug and then", "135:15", "you're walking up in the room again you", "135:17", "think you're there for the first time", "135:18", "because you don't remember having been", "135:19", "there before right and then this is", "135:21", "repeated ten times so we have a world", "135:25", "where either there is one one hour", "135:29", "experience of you in the room or else", "135:31", "it's a world with ten jorgen experiences", "135:35", "in the room we do not be sort of amnesia", "135:37", "in-between right but when you're in the", "135:41", "room now you find yourself in this room", "135:43", "you're wondering hmm is this the first", "135:46", "time I'm in this room it could be but it", "135:50", "could also be that later on and I was", "135:53", "just given an amnesiac okay so the", "135:56", "question now is when you wake up in this", "135:58", "room you have to assign probabilities to", "136:01", "these different places you could be in", "136:03", "time and maybe have to bet or or make", "136:06", "some decision that depends on where you", "136:08", "are", "136:10", "so what I guess I could ask you like so",

well", "136:28", "what is the probability that I'm", "136:30", "actually here versus what is the", "136:32", "probability that's highly unlikely", "136:33", "scenario that I keep getting drugged", "136:35", "over and over again every hour we", "136:37", "assumed that like in you're certain that", "136:40", "that the setup is such that there was", "136:42", "this mad scientist who had the means to", "136:44", "do this and he was gonna flip this coin", "136:46", "right so we assuming that that's you're", "136:48", "sure about that either way the only", "136:50", "thing you're unsure about is how the", "136:51", "coin landed okay well if that was a", "136:53", "scenario where I knew that there was a", "136:56", "possibility of a mad scientist and I", "136:58", "could wake up over and over again that", "136:59", "seems like a recipe for insanity well", "137:04", "it's a philosophical thought experiment", "137:06", "it's a way we can abstract away from my", "137:08", "ability and I'll get back to is there's", "137:10", "no evidence at all that we're in a", "137:13", "simulation so why wouldn't we assume", "137:15", "that the most likely scenario is taking", "137:17", "place which is we are just existing and", "137:19", "life is as it seems strange so okay so", "137:24", "if if you don't want to do this thought", "137:27", "experiment so incredibly limited distill", "137:33", "right the probability theory apart from", "137:36", "the wider simulation but I guess I could", "137:40", "also ask you if if we were to move", "137:43", "closer to this point where we ourselves", "137:45", "can create simulations if we survive we", "137:48", "become a multiplanetary we would build", "137:50", "planetary sized computers yeah how would", "137:54", "your probability in this simulation", "137:56", "hypothesis change as we kind of develop", "137:59", "it well will change based on the", "138:00", "evidence of some profound technological", "138:02", "innovation that actually we would allow", "138:04", "someone to create a simulation it's", "138:06", "indistinguishable from reality but I", "138:08", "would rather assume that reality itself", "138:11", "currently is just that because it seems", "138:14", "to be isn't that Occam's razor isn't", "138:17", "that the simplest answer this is reality", "138:20", "this is wood you are here you absolutely", "138:23", "here one day there may be a simulation", "138:25", "it has not happened yet yeah I think", "138:27", "it's not that comes Razer in that it", "138:30", "would require you to postulate that you", "138:32", "are this very unusual and special", "138:34", "observer amongst all the observers that", "138:37", "will exist but why is that but everyone", "138:40", "is unusual in their own way that's true", "138:43", "but there's no there's no clones there's", "138:45", "no one person that's a version that's", "138:48", "living the same exact life in a million", "138:50", "different scenarios but but in this", "138:52", "respect if there are all these", "138:55", "simulations then most of these people", "138:58", "are not special in this way that most of", "139:01", "them are simulated and only

simulations done well", "139:13", "who saying there never will be", "139:14", "well so this since since we don't know", "139:18", "what time it is now in external reality", "139:23", "right and we therefore can't tell from", "139:29", "looking at our evidence where we are in", "139:32", "in a world where either there is just an", "139:35", "original history and then it ends or", "139:37", "there is a world with an original", "139:38", "history and then a lot of simulations we", "139:41", "need to think about how to assign", "139:42", "probabilities given each of these two", "139:45",

and", "139:54", "so the question is in those types of", "139:58", "situations how do you allocate", "140:00", "probability over the different", "140:03", "hypotheses about how the world is", "140:05",

"140:34", "probabilistic prediction", "140:36", "from that like it seems like whatever", "140:37", "you observe would be observed by", "140:40", "somebody so how could you test that kind", "140:42",

billions of year later we evolves", "142:54", "and here we are now right suppose some", "142:57", "physicists told you that well the", "142:59", "universe is very big and early on in the", "143:01",

of our part space-time", "143:41", "like there are like a few very very rare", "143:43", "spontaneously materialized brains from", "143:46", "gas clouds early in the universe and", "143:47", "then

in", "144:16", "the universe and that's gonna be a lot", "144:18", "of territory that has life right these", "144:21", "are this is this is pure speculation but", "144:23", "this is a thought

matches relatives", "144:35", "I think irrelevant to the point I want", "144:37", "to make but so if this turn out to be", "144:40", "the way the world works a few weird ones", "144:42", "happening from gas clouds and then the", "144:44", "vast majority are just normal people", "144:46", "living on a planet would you similarly", "144:49", "say given that model that you should", "144:53", "think

"sorry yeah anyway I think that this", "145:10", "would be a structurally similar", "145:11", "situation where there would be a few", "145:12", "exceptional early living versions that", "145:18",

world we're", "145:49", "living in in that it looks like it's", "145:51", "infinitely big and that would have been", "145:53", "a few do Rogen's spontaneously generated", "145:55", "very early from random processes they're", "145:58", "going to be very few numbers compared to", "146:00", "ones that have you know recent on", "146:02", "planets so that by taking the path you", "146:08", "want to

answer to that", "147:21", "but with the qualification that a the", "147:24", "simulation argument doesn't even purport", "147:27", "to prove the simulation hypothesis", "147:29", "because there's

yet mmm yeah that's possible", "148:03", "too there's nothing really probable well", "148:07", "I think I mean to me it seems probable", "148:09", "only if at least one of the other", "148:12",

sometimes", "148:31", "wrong so I attach some probability to", "148:33", "that but but if we were working within", "148:35", "the parameters of what currently seems", "148:36", "to me to be the case

haven't figured out yet if if we come", "149:21", "back in 50 years even just with human", "149:26", "beings thinking about stuff", "149:28", "and I think I have this concept of a", "149:30", "crucial
