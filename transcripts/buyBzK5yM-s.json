the", "09:40", "organization it's kind of crazy yeah I", "09:43", "mean I think so that's normally the", "09:45", "focus of in effective charities is on", "09:47", "like yeah how much you spent on", "09:48", "overheads right but I actually think", "09:50", "that's not the most important thing the", "09:52", "most important thing is what's the", "09:54", "charity actually doing like what's the", "09:56", "actual program so one charity for", "09:58", "example that I'm sure like you'll find", "10:00", "funny is the charity called homeopaths", "10:02", "Without Borders and it goes to Haiti in",

"10:49", "how much money you're putting in and", "10:50", "what you getting is an outcome right", "10:51", "well I think it's impossible for", "10:54", "everyone to it's impossible for you to", "10:57", "give ten dollars and all ten dollars is", "11:00", "gonna go directly to the charity because", "11:01", "there's got to be overhead there's got", "11:03", "to be infrastructure there's got to be a", "11:04", "bunch of people working there rent", "11:06", "this is theirs costs but the question is", "11:09", "like at what point does it become kind", "11:12", "of a scam because there are most", "11:14", "certainly some organizations that appear", "11:18", "to be charitable organizations but a", "11:20", "really kind of a scam yeah there's", "11:22", "definitely some so like the kids wish", "11:24", "network for example kind of like the", "11:26", "make-a-wish Foundation similar idea and", "11:28", "they spent 99 percent of their budget on", "11:30", "fund raising so they would just like", "11:32", "this kind of charitable Ponzi scheme", "11:35", "basically so they spend all their money", "11:37", "on fund raising itself yeah to then", "11:40", "invest in more fund raising and 1%", "11:43", "somehow or another gets out there yeah", "11:44", "what does that maybe it's not as high as", "11:46", "99 percent it was above 90 bit something", "11:47", "crazy so what what does that money get", "11:49", "to like what do they do with the actual", "11:51", "money itself and then the idea behind", "11:53", "that was granting wishes for Sick", "11:55", "Children mm-hmm so do you remember the", "11:59", "San Francisco thing with batkid it was", "12:02", "like a bit like there was a big event", "12:03", "lots of publicity around it batkid a", "12:05", "child that had some

seriously sick kids", "12:32", "often terminally ill kids say what one", "12:34", "thing would you want and we'll make it", "12:36", "happen hmm", "12:37", "but I think the but there is a lot of", "12:40", "focus on like particularly bad charities", "12:42", "you know the ones that just really come", "12:44", "up to a completely dysfunctional I think", "12:46", "that's not actually the most important", "12:47", "message what's most important is just", "12:50", "even among the charities that are kind", "12:52", "of good even the ones that are making a", "12:53", "difference there's still a vast", "12:55", "difference in the impact you have", "12:57", "difference of hundreds of thousands of", "12:58", "times between the charities that are", "13:00", "merely good and there's ones that are", "13:02", "really the very best and that's", "13:04", "primarily dependent on what program are", "13:06", "they focusing on hmm so what is there", "13:09", "any charity that people should avoid", "13:11", "spending their money on like are there", "13:13", "other charities that you feel like are", "13:15", "just so ridiculously ineffective like", "13:18", "yeah I mean like the", "13:20", "ones

children", "13:39", "which has no evidence of working but", "13:43", "does actually just have some like risk", "13:46", "of the children drowning oh yeah so you", "13:49", "can like cherry-pick these examples but", "13:51", "the thing is that these aren't just like", "13:52", "not really about the sensitive in", "13:54", "general I think charity's doing good but", "13:57", "the question is just like in the same", "13:59", "way as if you're buying a product for", "14:00", "yourself you don't just want to get like", "14:02", "you know a laptop as long as it's works", "14:05", "you want to find like what's the best", "14:06", "laptop I can get with my money right or", "14:08", "if you're investing you want to not just", "14:10", "get like an okay of a turn you want to", "14:11", "see well what's the best of the turn I", "14:12", "can get right so in that sense I think", "14:15", "like the number of charities that you", "14:16", "think just yeah this is really competing", "14:18", "for being the most effective charity in", "14:20", "the world that's actually very small so", "14:22", "give well for examples evaluator looks", "14:25", "all sorts of different global health and",

just you", "16:16", "could clearly save this child that's", "16:18", "right in front of you you know you ought", "16:19", "to do that the cost of $3,000 does not", "16:21", "count", "16:22", "but then what Peter singers insight is", "16:25", "he says well what's the difference", "16:27", "between that child that's right there in", "16:28", "front of you and that child that's in", "16:30",

four like yeah is it gonna be", "25:12", "homosapiens around for the next you know", "25:15", "in the thousand years time i think that", "25:16", "would just be extremely unlikely that", "25:18",

lifetime you can", "25:45", "imagine a world without war most people", "25:47", "say no like the vast majority of people", "25:49", "say no the war a world without crime a", "25:52", "world without violence", "25:53", "a world without theft most people say no", "25:56", "that's that just shows you how", "25:58", "inherently flawed most people view the", "26:01", "human species you know we know that we", "26:02", "can do it in small groups mm-hm you know", "26:04", "like if the three of us were on an", "26:06", "island I'm pretty sure we wouldn't be", "26:07", "stealing from each other and murdering", "26:09", "each other right yeah it's just a few of", "26:10", "us but when you get to large-scale", "26:12", "humanity comes very easy to disassociate", "26:15", "or create this diffusion

I", "26:44", "think that I though not well we'd be", "26:47", "obsolete yeah I mean well we're we're", "26:49", "gonna be obsolete in a hundred years", "26:50", "anyway I mean as in we'll be dead right", "26:54", "so what the question is just we'll all", "26:57", "kind of you know generations hence well", "27:00", "you know it's not the questions not", "27:01", "really about us it's about our", "27:02", "grandchildren list what really forces", "27:04", "the idea to be considered like what is", "27:08", "valuable about life like is it the", "27:11", "experience is it happiness is it shared", "27:14", "fun is it love like what is what's", "27:18", "valuable about being a person and how", "27:20", "much of that is going to change if we're", "27:23", "made out of something that people have", "27:25", "created or or maybe we're made out of", "27:28", "something artificial intelligence has", "27:30", "created because we've created something", "27:31", "that's far superior to us so yeah I mean", "27:34", "I have a view and this as you might", "27:36", "expect yeah I mean in my view the thing", "27:39", "that's valuable and the only thing out", "27:41", "that's valuable ultimately is conscious", "27:42", "experience so that's good positive like", "27:45", "red conscious experience is happy", "27:48", "happiness joy and so on that's positive", "27:50", "that's good for the world how negative", "27:52", "conscious experience is suffering pain", "27:54", "distress those are bad for the world and", "27:56", "so that's why you know it's a good thing", "27:59", "for me to do some service to you to", "28:01", "benefit you but I can't do anything good", "28:04", "to benefit this bottle of water right", "28:06", "and so then the key question in terms of", "28:08", "what should we think about supposing is", "28:11", "the case that you know thousand years", "28:13", "time it's now synthetic life it's", "28:16", "artificial intelligence or something", "28:18", "that's the people like the in charge and", "28:23", "they're no longer any humans would this", "28:24", "be good or bad the question for me is", "28:27", "you know are they having conscious", "28:28", "experiences and others conscious", "28:30", "experiences good or bad so that's it", "28:33", "just conscious experience yeah so it's a", "28:35", "customer so selfish it's a controversial", "28:38", "view there's a thought experiment which", "28:40", "is often used to challenge this view do", "28:43", "you want to hear that yes so it's called", "28:45", "the experience machine and the idea is", "28:48", "supposing that tomorrow you could plug", "28:52", "into this machine it's like the most", "28:54", "amazing", "28:54", "you could ever have and in this machine", "28:57", "you will live let's say you live 200", "29:01", "years and you'll be in the most amazing", "29:02", "bliss you'll have the most amazing", "29:04", "experiences of you know and your", "29:06", "experiences will involve incredible", "29:08", "relationships incredible creative", "29:10", "achievement and so on and it'll just be", "29:13", "like the perfect life that you could", "29:14", "live experientially for the next 200", "29:17", "years", "29:17", "and the question is insofar as you are", "29:23", "self-interested so put aside", "29:25", "considerations you might have about", "29:27", "wanting to make the world a better place", "29:28", "but just insofar as you care about", "29:29", "yourself would you plug into this thing", "29:32", "bearing in mind that in a certain sense", "29:33", "all of these experiences are going to be", "29:35", "fake you're going to have experiences of", "29:37", "having amazing friendships wearing great", "29:40", "works of art and you think the works of", "29:42", "art and so on but they're they're not", "29:46", "going to be real", "29:46", "it's just sensory inputs provided by a", "29:50", "computer right so the question is would", "29:52", "you or ought you insofar as you're", "29:54", "self-interested plug into this machine", "29:57", "what would you answer", "29:59", "it's a very good question I might", "30:02", "already be plugged into it right I mean", "30:04", "you know so this is this is a great", "30:06", "question right and I think it's a good", "30:08", "argument against is the question well", "30:09", "supposing you were already plugged in", "30:10", "would you unplug supposing I told you", "30:13", "that actually you're a banker than", "30:15", "Monaco and fuck Monaco I just I'm not", "30:18", "interested in that no I want to stay", "30:20", "right here yeah so I stay plugged in", "30:22", "please do I have to pay more what have", "30:25", "to do you would have to do nothing but", "30:26", "it's interesting man if people think so", "30:30", "most people and it seemed like maybe", "30:32", "yourself would intuitively you'd say no", "30:34", "I wouldn't plug into this machine I", "30:36", "don't know if I would say that I would", "30:39", "have to really deeply consider because", "30:41", "right now it's just so it's so abstract", "30:44", "this idea that that could be possible so", "30:46", "it's it's fantasy we're having fun but", "30:50", "when you talk to the leading minds when", "30:54", "it comes to virtual reality or", "30:56", "artificial reality or simulation theory", "30:59", "you know when they start talking about", "31:01", "what will be possible one day they're", "31:04", "gonna without a doubt within a hundred", "31:06", "years or five hundred years or whatever", "31:07", "the numbers", "31:08", "they're going to be able to create an", "31:10", "artificial reality that's indiscernible", "31:11", "from this reality you're gonna be able", "31:13", "to feel things there's going to be", "31:15", "emotions that come to you you're going", "31:16", "they're going to be able to recreate", "31:18", "every single aspect of an everyday life", "31:20", "it's just a matter of time I mean", "31:22", "they're really close now and not not", "31:24", "really close in terms of like they don't", "31:26", "give you emotions and they don't give", "31:28", "you feeling but if you put on an HTC", "31:30", "vive and go through some of those", "31:32", "virtual reality games I mean it's", "31:34", "bizarre how real it feels yeah and when", "31:37", "you go back to like playing pong did you", "31:40", "ever play pong yeah you know it's such a", "31:44", "weird thing that that happened inside", "31:46", "about when I was a kid pong came along", "31:49", "we were blown away we couldn't believe", "31:51", "that we could actually do something on", "31:53", "the television you could see it move it", "31:56", "was so fantastic and if you gave that to", "31:59", "one of my kids they'd spit on it", "32:00", "they'd be like what kind of pizza shit", "32:02", "video game is this like they would think", "32:04", "it's just so ridiculous but to me at the", "32:06", "time it was amazing you go from that to", "32:09", "one of these HTC vive games which is all", "32:11", "taking place within on my lifetime and", "32:14", "you go well a lifetime from now if you", "32:16", "follow the exponential increase in the", "32:18", "ability the technological innovation", "32:20", "it's gonna be spectacular", "32:22", "it's gonna be absolutely so when that", "32:24", "does happen how will you be able to know", "32:27", "if it's indiscernible how will you know", "32:29", "if you're in it and how do you know if", "32:31", "you're not in it right now that's the", "32:32", "real question right yeah I mean there's", "32:34", "actually some arguments for thinking you", "32:37", "know this is Nick Bostrom a colleague of", "32:38", "mine a simulation argument for thinking", "32:40", "we are in a situation right now in fact", "32:42", "it's very likely that we should be yeah", "32:45", "by that I actually I'm kind of agnostic", "32:49", "I think you should take that the", "32:51", "hypothesis seriously but I think the the", "32:56", "argument doesn't quite go through for", "32:58", "what's attractive and what's not", "33:00", "attractive about that there you his", "33:03", "version of it yeah so the argument is", "33:05", "the frame and if you could yeah yeah", "33:07", "yeah so his argument is the in the", "33:09", "future supposing we believe that the",

somewhat", "35:11", "technical but the basic thought is just", "35:15", "um according to like the best guesses", "35:19", "from cosmologists were actually in an", "35:21", "infinite universe the

this", "41:30", "virtual reality again this experience", "41:34", "machine that you could plug yourself", "41:35", "into and as part of the description I", "41:39", "said oh none of this would be

would be because you know if", "42:18", "you think about Star Trek you've drawn", "42:20", "Luc Picard it can be blends with data", "42:22", "and Android he's not kind of bio", "42:24", "biological but you know we think that", "42:28", "you can still have kind of moral worth", "42:31", "and friendships and so on with creatures", "42:33", "that are not made of kind of human", "42:35", "biology in which case why does the fact", "42:38", "that something merely lives on silicon", "42:40", "why wouldn't that was kind of seemingly", "42:44", "merely software why does that mean you", "42:46", "couldn't have kind of a genuine", "42:47", "friendship with that thing if ax and a", "42:50", "sufficiently sophisticated way perhaps", "42:52", "isn't there also an issue with our", "42:54",

yeah I mean I think consciousness is", "44:24", "probably just ultimately a physical", "44:25", "process why do you think that in", "44:29", "ultimately because of conservation of", "44:32", "energy", "44:33", "the reason being so you know this is oh", "44:36", "yeah age-old philosophical debate", "44:38", "between the monists and duelists people", "44:42", "who think is consciousness just", "44:44", "ultimately some sort of physical process", "44:46", "or is it something special so Descartes", "44:49", "thought there was this pineal gland", "44:52", "there's a little bit of your brain and", "44:53", "your conscious kind of soul was just", "44:57", "kind of steering you're like monkey body", "44:59", "through this pineal gland but the", "45:03", "question is just for why that I think", "45:05", "the strongest argument about why that", "45:07", "couldn't be right is it seems to be like", "45:10", "it would have to be creating energy out", "45:11", "of nowhere and we've never it seems to", "45:15", "be just fixed law of the universe that", "45:17", "that just can't happen because in order", "45:20", "for you know this conscious mind - if", "45:24", "it's not merely a physical process if", "45:26", "it's not just the brain in order for it", "45:28", "to be able to affect what this physical", "45:30", "entity is doing it would have to use", "45:32", "energy to be able to do that so the", "45:35", "energy would have to be coming from", "45:36", "somewhere and if it's not coming from", "45:38", "just the physical realm then suddenly we", "45:40", "got this counter example to all the rest", "45:42", "of science sort of but are you aware of", "45:45", "the theories of human neurotransmitters", "45:48", "being pathways to other dimensions like", "45:50", "dimethyltryptamine do you know about all", "45:52", "that I mean I know about DMT do you know", "45:55", "do sin the pineal gland where Descartes", "45:58", "thought that all that stuff was going on", "45:59", "the seat of the soul with the Egyptians", "46:01", "called the Eye of Horus the reason why", "46:03", "the Catholics and so many ancient", "46:05", "religions were so focused on

for", "46:15", "people have had these intense", "46:17", "transformative psychedelic experiences", "46:19", "by consuming exogenous", "46:21", "dimethyltryptamine which is produced by", "46:23", "the brain that you have these insane", "46:25", "transformative experiences where you", "46:27", "feel like you are traveling to other", "46:28", "dimensions yeah so I think I mean I do", "46:32", "want to say like have you done any of", "46:33", "that I've never done the MT Oh son of a", "46:36", "bitch why not what are you doing wasting", "46:37", "your time I know I am such a good boy", "46:40", "but but it's something that's in the", "46:43", "brain I mean it's a natural product of", "46:45", "human biology I mean whether its natural", "46:47", "or not isn't the question just you know", "46:50", "if I'm gonna have a career based on my", "46:51", "brain I want to be very careful to to", "46:54", "not break it no break it you know yeah", "46:56", "but it's one of the most transient drugs", "46:58", "ever observed in the body about it", "46:59", "brings it back to baseline in like 15", "47:01", "minutes", "47:01", "mmm okay is that because I mean there's", "47:04", "a lot of I do think there's like tons of", "47:06", "people very often greatly overestimate", "47:09", "the risk so non-legal drugs like MDMA is", "47:11", "like super safe and so on very", "47:14", "overestimate the list the risks of", "47:17", "everything yeah MDMA yeah yeah EMA is", "47:20", "weird right that's a weird one it's it's", "47:22", "not a natural drug dimethyltryptamine I", "47:26", "think the real concern would be", "47:27", "psychological because what you face is", "47:30", "so bizarre turns for credit and I kind", "47:32", "of had the best quote about it I think", "47:33", "he said that you would risk death by", "47:36", "astonishment hmm yeah okay to the thing", "47:39", "well it's so bizarre that it's almost a", "47:43", "sin for a guy as smart as you did not", "47:45", "experience it but will you just come", "47:46", "right back in your you even when you're", "47:48", "there you're there maybe it's you it's", "47:50", "not like you your consciousness", "47:52", "dissolves into some bizarre quasi living", "47:56", "State and then you have to like work", "47:58", "your way back to being you again you", "48:00", "know your you your will McCaskill in the", "48:03", "dimension whatever the fuck it is but", "48:05", "what's crazy about it is that this is", "48:07", "produced in the very area where", "48:09", "Descartes was believing the seat of the", "48:11", "soul is and so

were all", "48:26", "convinced that that one gland had some", "48:29", "massive significance in terms of the", "48:32", "spirit in the soul whatever that means", "48:34", "whatever the spirit means so yeah so", "48:36", "then the question is just in these", "48:37", "experiences is it the case that you're", "48:41", "like seeing into genuinely seeing into", "48:43", "another dimension right or is it the", "48:44", "case that you just have a new kind of", "48:46", "perspective on consciousness so one", "48:47", "thing I do think is that in terms of", "48:51", "conscious experience is the sort of", "48:52", "conscious experiences that", "48:54", "have access to and I think that must", "48:56", "just be point zero zero one percent of", "48:58", "the entire landscape of possible", "49:00",

"I don't think that maps onto any sort of", "49:09", "conscious experience that humans could", "49:11", "have have you seen people do that you", "49:12", "know the people young people can do that", "49:14", "it's pretty amazing that is it is", "49:16", "amazing to shockingly effectively uh", "49:19", "yeah I think you're absolutely right I", "49:22", "mean but there's also experiences human",

"49:41", "incredible psychedelic experiences from", "49:43", "that as well yeah and so I think like", "49:46", "these sorts of experiences are very", "49:48", "important very interesting and what", "49:52", "they're you know I said that maybe we", "49:54", "experiences point zero one percent of", "49:56", "all possible conscious experiences and", "49:57", "that just allows you to do like see a", "49:59", "little bit more of this potential vast", "50:01", "landscape whereas I think but I think", "50:05", "there's nothing unmagical about saying", "50:07", "ultimately that's all explained in terms", "50:09", "of physics in terms of different sorts", "50:12", "of new lands filing and different amount", "50:13", "of transmitters and so on we don't need", "50:16", "to say oh and it's also this other thing", "50:18", "which Blake's all the known laws of", "50:22", "physics that you're seeing into some", "50:24", "other dimension in order for that to be", "50:25", "an incredibly

is Lelia this well I'm conscious", "50:57", "and so I know that things that kind of", "50:59", "like me are probably conscious too and", "51:01", "that's the best we've got really and", "51:04", "this is known as a hard problem of", "51:05", "consciousness", "51:06", "and philosophers often say that we've", "51:09", "solved it with something and I think", "51:10", "it's always begging the question

unexplored territory", "51:22", "we should think contemporary science", "51:25", "this is just a big like big black gap in", "51:29", "a scientific understanding and perhaps", "51:32", "it's something maybe 21st century", "51:34", "science maybe 22nd century science can", "51:36", "really get to grips with yeah it does", "51:39", "seem like the ultimate question like", "51:41", "what is it for why is it here what", "51:45", "controls it is it in the mind is it", "51:47", "external is the brain just an antenna", "51:50", "that tunes into consciousness yeah the", "51:54", "the dimethyltryptamine

think it's two answers", "58:48", "here okay the first is that the right is", "58:51", "the like goal right ultimately again if", "58:54", "you think the purpose of life is to", "58:56", "increase the amount of happiness and", "58:58", "reduce the amount of suffering the final", "59:00", "goal is good experiences and the kind of", "59:02", "anti goal as bad experiences so when", "59:04", "we're sitting here talking having a", "59:06", "great time this is us kind of achieving", "59:08", "this is getting points on the wind", "59:10", "counter so at a time that's like yeah if", "59:14", "we were really hating this then we'd be", "59:15", "losing well even more so because we're", "59:17", "broadcasting this live and millions of", "59:20", "people are gonna hear it", "59:21", "yeah and hopes about having hopefully", "59:23", "about enjoying hopefully and maybe if", "59:24", "they're not at least there's a little", "59:26", "stress relief like maybe they're at the", "59:27", "gym and I go these fucking idiots", "59:28", "yeah and they're doing squats and", "59:30", "they're getting angry yeah so I think", "59:32", "that's the first thing but then the", "59:34", "second thing is relates to this idea of", "59:38", "cosmic significance where what often", "59:42", "motivates you say oh well we're just", "59:44", "along for a ride we're all gonna get", "59:45", "eaten up by the

"60:15", "saying what we want to do is promote", "60:17", "happiness and reduce suffering if that", "60:20", "means we can live on other planets as", "60:22", "well and have kind of fiving", "60:24", "civilizations they're not only where the", "60:26", "people are having great lives but also", "60:28", "making scientific artistic contributions", "60:30", "and so on then that's a good thing to do",

question you've raised is", "63:14", "called the Fermi paradox right which is", "63:17", "just given the somme to a hundred", "63:19", "billion stars in our galaxy eight", "63:22", "billion galaxies in the effect of all", "63:24", "universe 100 billion in the observable", "63:27", "universe the universe is also pretty old", "63:30", "fifteen billion years old so if it was", "63:34", "the case

of aliens all over the", "63:46", "brains but yet we see absolutely none", "63:48", "and that means that from somewhere from", "63:51", "a habitable planet somewhere along the", "63:53", "path from habitable planet to a", "63:56", "spacefaring civilization there must be", "63:59", "some big filter there must be some step", "64:02", "that's just incredibly hard for that or", "64:06", "incredibly unlikely other civilization", "64:08", "moves them all life moves in that step", "64:09", "to another and one hypothesis is this", "64:12", "yeah like people just civilization gets", "64:16", "to a sufficiently advanced level and", "64:19", "they just chill out", "64:19", "they just or they go internally yeah", "64:21", "they go internal the issue of that", "64:23", "explanation I think is just not", "64:25", "long enough because you know you'd have", "64:28", "to think that that's for this kind of", "64:30", "filter to work has to be a really", "64:32", "schlong filter filter yeah as in like", "64:35", "because there's so many stars so many", "64:37", "mm-hmm so many seemingly habitable", "64:40", "planets right it has to be the case that", "64:42", "it's exceptionally unlikely at some", "64:45", "stage of other like not just really", "64:48", "unlikely as in like you know one in a", "64:50", "trillion unlikely to on this path from", "64:55", "habitable planet space failing", "64:57", "civilization and so you'd have to think", "64:59", "like other trillion civilizations that", "65:02", "get to this level of technological", "65:03", "ability they all choose to turn inward", "65:05", "and that seems just very unlikely it", "65:08", "seems like well at least one would", "65:09", "really transferred out and if so then", "65:13", "we'd see evidence of that because", "65:16",

"65:27", "to see a real evidence of that is kind", "65:30", "of small so I actually think that a", "65:32", "reason that we can't see aliens is", "65:34", "because the very first stages of life", "65:37", "are incredibly unlikely the move from", "65:40", "nothing to can a basic replication and", "65:42", "then secondly the move from", "65:44", "single-celled organisms to multi-celled", "65:47", "organisms and the reason for thinking", "65:50", "this is very unlikely is it took an", "65:52", "incredibly long time on earth billions", "65:55", "of years before this happened and in", "65:57", "particular in the move from single cell", "65:59", "to multi-celled life that's only ever", "66:01", "happened once and so given that we don't", "66:04", "see any aliens we should think some part", "66:07", "of this was really hard our best guess", "66:09", "is that that that moved them single cell", "66:12", "to multi-celled and perhaps from the", "66:14", "creation of the first cells as well that", "66:17", "was incredibly difficult and that means", "66:19", "that we're just exceptionally lucky to", "66:22", "be alive as it were but if the universe", "66:25", "is infinite that means that this has", "66:27", "happened an infinite number of times", "66:29", "that's right though it might be very far", "66:32", "away public like sufficiently far away", "66:34", "that we are not

"66:53", "other people who say it's their leading", "66:55", "well the most puzzling hypothesis to me", "66:58", "was the evidence of supermassive black", "67:01", "holes being at the center of every", "67:03", "galaxy and that the hypothesis was that", "67:06", "the supermassive black holes are exactly", "67:09", "one-half of 1% of the mass the entire", "67:11", "galaxy and then if you go through those", "67:14", "supermassive black holes you may in fact", "67:15", "go into a completely new universe filled", "67:19", "with hundreds of billions of galaxies", "67:20", "each with

"68:02", "assume that there's someone more", "68:05", "advanced than us like it is possible", "68:07", "that someone some species some thing is", "68:11", "the tip of the spear that some thing is",

most", "68:25", "advanced thing that we can find the only", "68:28", "logic that I could point to was that", "68:30", "that we are relatively young in terms of", "68:33", "the history and the age of

the", "71:15", "age of the universe that's actually just", "71:17", "a very short period of Brian but why", "71:19", "would you assume that a hundred thousand", "71:21", "light years from now there's not", "71:22", "something exactly like us", "71:24", "so it's possible but the thing is that", "71:26", "if it was somewhat easy or if it was", "71:29", "just not incredibly difficult for", "71:31",

light waves of", "73:32", "what the components of the atmosphere is", "73:34", "and so using your analogy what I'm", "73:36", "suggesting is that if it was the case", "73:39", "that alien life was like not intelligent", "73:43", "life was not that hard to come by you'd", "73:45", "stick your head out with ten and you", "73:46", "look like Tokyo I've often looking like", "73:48", "the woods but why does it have to look", "73:50", "like Tokyo why can't it look like Kansas", "73:52", "why can't it be like really spread out", "73:55", "and very little life because I think if", "73:58", "life is letting out then it's just gonna", "74:00", "want to what does life do it justifies", "74:02", "to harness resources and tries to grow", "74:04", "more of itself maybe it reaches a point", "74:06",

maybe it's the", "74:16", "case that like yeah like is it more", "74:19", "important to get your shit together at", "74:21", "home or to go all over the world with", "74:24", "the same bullshit ideas right I think", "74:27", "that's the case would not be the same", "74:29", "thing you could turn towards", "74:31", "interstellar travel like wouldn't it be", "74:33", "more important for these

they're like let's say they're 1,000", "74:57", "years more advanced than humans are at", "74:59", "the moment in order for this argument to", "75:02", "work it'd have to be good case that", "75:03", "every single one of them makes that", "75:05", "decision to just turn inwards and focus", "75:07", "on the case because not all those people", "75:10", "would be the ones that would innovate in",

"75:26", "everyone really is well yeah I mean just", "75:29", "technological progress just keeps going", "75:31", "and eventually like tape", "75:33", "mean obviously we're doing this like", "75:34", "weird thought experiment right", "75:36", "speculating on like economics and", "75:38", "sociology of hypothetical alien world", "75:41", "but I mean just at some point as that as", "75:46", "a civilization progresses then there's", "75:50", "going to be many many actors with", "75:53", "sufficient power so it's sort of", "75:56", "liability to spread to the stars you", "75:58", "need to say that every single one of", "76:00", "them decides to turn inwards so it's", "76:02", "sort of like technology becomes very", "76:05", "rare and then ultimately over time", "76:07", "becomes very common like the cellphone", "76:09", "right so when if cellphone was first", "76:12", "invented it was extremely rare and very", "76:14", "expensive now everyone has one and the", "76:17", "capabilities of those cell phones have", "76:19", "greatly greatly improved yeah and that", "76:22", "this will happen with everything", "76:23", "including space travel yeah I mean it", "76:25", "also it doesn't need to be the case that", "76:27", "gets out to 10 billion people even if it", "76:28", "was just like a thousand people or", "76:29", "something again it would just seem", "76:31", "unlikely that you know in every", "76:33", "civilization and every one just has you", "76:36", "know even just a thousand people", "76:37", "everyone chooses not what single person", "76:40", "thinks hey we just want there to be more", "76:43", "like right spread out now that obviously", "76:45", "is dependent upon there being a more", "76:48", "advanced civilization than human beings", "76:49", "on planet Earth because if there weren't", "76:52", "if there were a few years behind us like", "76:54", "if there are the stuck in the 1950s or", "76:55", "maybe they're stuck in ancient Greece or", "76:58", "you know then then obviously they don't", "77:00", "have the capabilities yet we might be", "77:02", "the very most advanced we might be the", "77:04", "very tip of the spear right yeah and I", "77:06", "just think yeah because I think it would", "77:08", "be unlikely that something more advanced", "77:13", "happened just a little bit faster than", "77:16", "us but not say 100 million years ago", "77:19", "which is not very long ago right in", "77:21", "cosmic terms but it's still possible I", "77:23", "mean it's still possible that something", "77:25", "happened 100 years quicker than us or", "77:27", "that they haven't had the same setbacks", "77:29", "that we've had in terms of like asteroid", "77:32", "impacts and natural catastrophe super", "77:35", "volcanoes and the like yeah it's a it's", "77:37", "a real weird thought experiment because", "77:40", "you start thinking and you start", "77:41", "extrapolating okay but where are we", "77:43", "gonna be you know where are we gonna be", "77:44", "and why would we do that like that's one", "77:46", "things that always gets me about this", "77:47", "whole trip to Mars and I have a joke", "77:49", "about it in my my last comedy special", "77:52", "where people were somebody actually said", "77:54", "this to me like because it was before", "77:55", "California it solved its drought or", "77:57", "mother nature solve our drought for us", "77:59", "rather people like a man we should", "78:01", "really consider going to Mars because I", "78:03", "mean look at our environment", "78:04", "California's almost out of water and my", "78:06", "joke was like we're right next to the", "78:08", "fucking ocean like there's so much water", "78:10", "you can't see the end of it we have a", "78:11", "salt problem we know have a water", "78:13", "problem like what are you gonna do you", "78:15", "gonna bring water to Mars like that's a", "78:16", "stupidest thing I've ever heard of my", "78:18", "wife yeah this is weird when people", "78:20", "start talking about Mars I mean I think", "78:21", "so there's a project of going to Mars", "78:24", "saying foreign laws sang up a colony", "78:26", "right now like the aim of doing that", "78:28", "because it's awesome totally on ban with", "78:30", "that from the same way is like going to", "78:31", "the moon it's like look what we can", "78:32", "achieve this is an exciting like global", "78:34", "human project or even just a Space", "78:36", "Shuttle going into orbit it's pretty", "78:37", "badass right yeah exactly", "78:38", "exactly but then this talk of like oh", "78:40", "well we need this in order to be able to", "78:42", "survive as a species and like look if", "78:45", "you want to have this kind of refuge or", "78:47", "colony in order to make the earth more", "78:50", "robust Mars is just not a great place to", "78:53", "pick whereas so many different ways that", "78:56", "I mean Mars is like really on her", "78:58", "inhospitable and if you wanted to build", "79:00", "a refuge why not go under the sea mmm", "79:03", "that's like gonna be protected from you", "79:07", "know viruses or asteroid impacts now", "79:10", "really though if one of those big things", "79:12", "that slammed into the Yucatan slams into", "79:14", "where your villages and the sea I mean", "79:16", "if you if you had this underwater", "79:18", "village with you know 10 years of food", "79:20", "supplies and so on then you could like", "79:22", "come back because the impact from the", "79:24", "asteroid wasn't just like shook everyone", "79:26", "artists that the sky is gone the skies", "79:28", "get clouded over with that the earth", "79:30", "rang for a million years", "79:32", "Oh what is that as Italy impact yeah", "79:36", "that's so interesting that's so insane", "79:39", "yeah when you think about how big that", "79:40", "thing was that killed the dinosaurs 65", "79:42", "million years ago and there's hundreds", "79:45", "of thousands of those things floating", "79:46", "around Jase so yeah I was asking some", "79:48", "people at NASA just just two days ago", "79:52", "actually on how many of them we've", "79:54", "managed to identify because they're", "79:56", "serious about kind of scanning the skies", "79:58", "yeah", "79:59", "the mall um and the answer I thought we", "80:03", "had it covered I thought this was", "80:04", "something than this I was like yeah yeah", "80:06", "we know we're all there like earth", "80:08", "killers are and they never sponsors like", "80:10", "no we've got no idea we just we don't", "80:12", "know how many of them are out there and", "80:14", "so we don't know how many we've managed", "80:16", "to track there's a guy named Randall", "80:18", "Carlson and I've had him on podcast a", "80:19", "few times and he's obsessed with the", "80:21", "idea that asteroid impacts were probably", "80:25", "what ended the Ice Age you know 10 to", "80:27", "12,000 years ago and and he there's a", "80:30", "significant amount of physical evidence", "80:32", "that points to this both in evidence of", "80:35", "impact and nuclear glass try think it's", "80:38", "called try tonight I forget out the", "80:40", "exact word but it appears all throughout", "80:43", "Europe and Asia and around that same", "80:45", "timeline around 10,000 and 12,000 years", "80:48", "ago when they do core samples and it", "80:51", "points to this idea that there were", "80:53", "significant impacts from asteroid", "80:57", "objects all over Europe and all over", "80:59", "Asia around that time they think some of", "81:02", "them slammed into the ice caps that were", "81:05", "you know North America was covered in a", "81:07", "giant chunk of it was covered in as much", "81:09", "as two miles high of ice just 10,000", "81:12", "years ago and he points to an incredible", "81:14", "amount of physical change in the", "81:16", "environment that looks like it took", "81:18", "place over a very short period of time", "81:20", "like catastrophic change over incredibly", "81:24", "short met amount of time that he", "81:25", "believes points to these impacts melting", "81:29", "the ice caps creating massive amount of", "81:32", "flooding killing off who knows how many", "81:34", "people", "81:34", "resetting civilization in many different", "81:36", "parts of the world and this evidence of", "81:40", "these of the new clear glass of these", "81:43", "micro diamonds that also exists they", "81:46", "find them during nuclear test sites when", "81:49", "they blow off bombs and they also find", "81:51", "them at asteroid impact sites and you", "81:54", "know when you know that we have been hit", "81:56", "many times in the past and they do have", "81:58", "evidence of that and then you see the", "81:59", "moon and all the different impact", "82:01", "craters on the moon you know that this", "82:02", "is just what he calls a cosmic shooting", "82:04", "gallery essentially he's like it's very", "82:07", "likely that that was the cause of the", "82:10", "end of the ice age there's a lot of", "82:12", "there's climate data that sort of seems", "82:14", "to point to that as well okay so this so", "82:16", "this is now like really I'll send you", "82:21", "some links to some of his stuff because", "82:22", "he's been obsessed with this for about", "82:23", "30 years okay because the fascinating", "82:25", "guy the two things that would really", "82:27", "surprise me about that firstly just that", "82:29", "you know there were so many ice ages and", "82:31", "it was seem to be this it comes on goes", "82:34", "oh sure you know the you know fairly", "82:38", "dynamic predictable process where", "82:40", "there's asteroid impact super random", "82:41", "mmm-hmm he wouldn't expect to have this", "82:43", "kind of back-and-forth dynamic if it was", "82:45", "passed away that was doing it and then", "82:47", "secondly my understanding would be that", "82:49", "asteroids would cool the planet because", "82:50", "asteroid hits ash just spreads out all", "82:53", "over the sky that just blocks out", "82:56", "sunlight hmm so it would surprise me if", "82:59", "it had this kind of warming effect well", "83:01", "I think the idea is that first of all", "83:04", "when it hits it the impact is massive", "83:07", "and it melts off just a huge chunk of", "83:10", "the amount of water that is covering", "83:12", "North America right and that's one of", "83:14", "the things that causes this massive", "83:16", "flooding and massive changing of the", "83:18", "topography and as far as like what", "83:20", "causes the net I don't know if it it", "83:22", "interrupts it temporarily and then it", "83:25", "comes back and gets warmer but they have", "83:27", "that natural cycle of warming and", "83:30", "cooling has been going on since they I", "83:32", "mean from as far back as they can", "83:33", "measure it what he's talking about is", "83:35", "significant quick changes also the", "83:38", "extinction event that killed somewhere", "83:40", "around 65 percent or more of all of the", "83:45", "large mammals in North America really", "83:48", "quickly like woolly mammoths really", "83:49", "quickly sometimes really they don't know", "83:52", "about that that's there's a lot of", "83:53", "speculation back and forth about that", "83:55", "because they think that humans did it", "83:57", "but then they found these mass dead", "83:59", "sites where they're not consumed and", "84:01", "this was the ones that he showed where", "84:04", "these willy mammoths they found them", "84:06", "where they had their legs were broken", "84:09", "and it looked like they just the impact", "84:11", "of something had knocked them flat and", "84:13", "they had found like thousands of them", "84:15", "and these mass death sites I think but I", "84:17", "thought so firstly it just seemed to me", "84:21", "like the homo the idea that it was", "84:23", "humans killing the mold it seems like", "84:24", "crazy oh no I thought it just like", "84:26", "like such a good expert but they didn't", "84:28", "even have speed they had addle addle oh", "84:29", "but that was like the best weapon they", "84:31", "had at the time they weren't even riding", "84:32", "on horseback at the time but then with", "84:34", "respect to the death sights I thought", "84:35", "the mechanism for killing a wooly", "84:37", "mammoths is you just got like 200 humans", "84:39", "and you just chase the wooly mammoths", "84:40", "off a cliff that does work if you can", "84:42", "get a near cliff but the idea of getting", "84:44", "them all near cliffs and killing them", "84:46", "all off by a bunch of people that hadn't", "84:48", "figured out the wheel seems a little", "84:49", "unlikely it's just it's possible because", "84:55", "that's the thing like we often tell", "84:56", "these stories about you know police", "84:59", "civilization humans is like oh and then", "85:01", "they might create it amazing this great", "85:02", "journey to Europe and so on and often", "85:06", "that's like if they moved a mile of the", "85:07", "brain so it's like fake journeys", "85:09", "actually just yes yes very gradual", "85:12", "similarly if you've got this gravesite", "85:14", "hundreds of woolly mammoths in this one", "85:16", "place that might be over thousands of", "85:18", "years I mean again this is just", "85:19", "something no that's the thing they're", "85:20", "talking about carbon dating that they're", "85:22", "all it's all like within the same time", "85:24", "period you'd have to like really go over", "85:26", "his stuff with a fine-tooth comb and", "85:27", "talk to him about it because I'm not the", "85:28", "right guy I just I just listen to him", "85:30", "and go whoa and then you know try to", "85:32", "relay it as much as possible there's a", "85:34", "podcast that I actually retweeted today", "85:36", "because somebody brought it up on", "85:38", "YouTube it's available so I'll send you", "85:40", "to it afterwards to see if you what do", "85:42", "you think about it but but this is", "85:44", "something yeah but if you know the book", "85:45", "sapiens know you're like the fifth", "85:48", "person to talk about it I've got to get", "85:49", "everyone talks about safety and savings", "85:51", "is like the book yeah closer to you", "85:55", "because difference in this town um but", "85:58", "yeah one of the things that most blew my", "85:59", "mind there was yeah how much megafauna", "86:01", "there was in the early days of homo", "86:04", "sapiens", "86:05", "you know about moving across North", "86:07", "America there were two-ton sloths", "86:10", "mmm Jayant sloths and is one of just", "86:12", "very very many massive megafauna that we", "86:15", "just don't have anymore", "86:17", "yeah the Blitzkrieg hypothesis is what", "86:19", "they call the human animal killing off", "86:22", "all the other animals it's a really", "86:25", "troubling hypothesis because we don't", "86:28", "want to think that we're capable of", "86:29", "doing that but obviously we do do that I", "86:31", "mean we're doing it right now we get", "86:32", "into the Buffalo I mean we almost we", "86:34", "brought the Bison Toto yeah we're doing", "86:36", "it just", "86:37", "Tasmanian tiger there's a lot of", "86:39", "different animals that we", "86:40", "in our lifetime of gone extinct I mean", "86:42", "we're actually like in terms of", "86:43", "extinctions I'm not sure if we'll get", "86:46", "the number right but it would be pretty", "86:48", "accurate to describe this is the fourth", "86:49", "and makes tension with mass extinction", "86:52", "because yeah huge the number of species", "86:55", "that have gone extinct as a result of", "86:56", "human activity and it's also one of", "86:58", "those things where we don't think of it", "87:00", "as being significant because it happens", "87:02", "slowly over the course of many years but", "87:04", "if you look at it on timeline you like", "87:06", "oh my god look everything's dying right", "87:07",

too many of them yeah", "93:43", "it's the same with kangaroos as well", "93:45", "yeah yeah cuz I've seen those herds of", "93:47", "kangaroos you ever seen that no oh my", "93:49", "god there's a video that some guy took", "93:52", "and somewhere in Australia and it is", "93:57", "thousands and thousands of kangaroos", "93:59", "running across this field and it looks", "94:01", "like a clock but like some apocalypse", "94:04", "some apocalyptic kangaroo invasion see", "94:07", "if you can find that Jamie the video", "94:08", "just because it's worth seeing to like", "94:10", "to realize like oh this is what can", "94:12", "happen when there's no predators like", "94:15", "animals just get completely out of", "94:16", "control", "94:17", "yeah so I'm vegetarian and have been for", "94:19", "a long time now but with some other", "94:22", "vegetarian friends we had the", "94:24", "conversation of yeah what would be the", "94:25", "most ethical meat to eat and I think we", "94:28", "can concluded that kangaroo would be the", "94:30", "most ethical because it's being killed", "94:32", "anyway because they just need it like", "94:34", "you've got this population

though", "94:55", "yeah I mean if it's very nutritious", "94:57", "apparently kangaroos is actually a type", "94:59", "of deer believe it or not yeah I don't", "95:02", "believe that", "95:02", "I thought soupy which is a totally", "95:04", "different it is but it's related to the", "95:06", "deer in some strip look at these fuckers", "95:08", "just hanging out this is not the one I'm", "95:11", "talking about though there's a bunch of", "95:12", "them running across a field this is just", "95:14", "a large population of kangaroo yeah you", "95:18", "know there's something we lay in the", "95:20", "deer family in some strange way see if", "95:22", "Jamie could find that to do you know", "95:23", "that we have Wallabies in Scotland yeah", "95:25", "I know yeah in an island called inch", "95:27", "Konica yeah I visited them a number of", "95:29", "times and were they introduced to", "95:32", "Scotland yeah so lady", "95:34", "Aven Cahoon had that bitch yeah well no", "95:38", "need for that she so she I'd actually", "95:42", "don't know but she owned she owned the", "95:44", "island she owned a zoo on the island", "95:46", "like a personal zoo and she died I think", "95:53", "the route the zoo went to back in", "95:55", "everyone so it just kind of was a while", "95:57", "please just got out and there's and the", "95:59", "Wallabies took over yeah the first", "96:02", "evidence because people wouldn't likely", "96:03", "visit this was they would find these", "96:05", "dead wallaby carcasses on the mainland", "96:07", "and that was during the winter the law", "96:10", "Scottish for Lake would freeze over and", "96:12", "the Wallabies would hop on the ice Wow", "96:15", "and get hit by a car but they're now", "96:17", "very tame it was a shame because I first", "96:20", "found out about them back when it was", "96:22", "still a bit of a secret well that's", "96:24", "fascinating now it's become a bit of a", "96:26", "tourist hotspot Wow says they're", "96:30", "kangaroos are marsupials and more", "96:32", "closely related to possums than deer", "96:34", "okay so they're not related to deer and", "96:36", "then correct yeah mmm someone had told", "96:39", "me that they were in some way in the", "96:40", "deer family or cousins of deer or", "96:43", "something like that said earlier you", "96:44", "explorers said that they were just", "96:45", "that's what their descriptions were they", "96:47", "were like deers without antlers and they", "96:49", "stood upright like men but I saw so I", "96:53", "mean it's a queue or a question so I", "96:54", "didn't find like an official scientist", "96:56", "saying here's the siding on it but uh", "96:58", "yeah that's what hmm I wish I had this", "97:01", "my whole life", "97:02", "someone who could just follow me around", "97:03", "and connect to me every time they say", "97:05", "something about this is amazing time", "97:07", "somebody put something up on Instagram", "97:09", "today and it was a quote from the 1800s", "97:13", "about an ancient philosopher or an", "97:16", "ancient scholar rather would give his", "97:18", "life for the information that's", "97:20", "available to the common schoolboy today", "97:22", "and this is from a quote from 1888 Wow", "97:27", "which is nothing now compared to what we", "97:30", "can do yeah I think there was another", "97:32", "statistic and again it's unclear how do", "97:34", "you measure this but in terms of written", "97:36", "information at least one newspaper has", "97:39", "more of it an information in it than you", "97:43", "know a typical person in the seventeen", "97:45", "hundreds would be exposed to for the", "97:46", "entire life", "97:47", "I wonder what what was the natural", "97:49", "predator of kangaroos", "97:51", "because kangaroos are they're a native", "97:54", "animal to Australia and if they didn't", "97:56", "do you know there was a giant predator", "97:58", "in New Zealand at least at one point", "98:00", "time it was called the haast eagle and", "98:03", "it was an enormous eagle the biggest", "98:05", "eagle they think that ever lived and had", "98:07", "something like a 10-foot wingspan and", "98:08", "they believe that even hunted people a", "98:11", "huge huge eagle and it's a part of the I", "98:14", "guess it's the Maori it's a part of", "98:17", "their ancient mythology and they found", "98:19", "out that it was actually a real animal", "98:21", "that was somewhere around the 1400s was", "98:24", "made extinct through hunting my", "98:27", "understanding was in Australia before", "98:30", "humans invaded crocodiles my understand", "98:34", "was there was just no major predators", "98:36", "for that's the cat has manian Tigers the", "98:40", "thylacine yeah they call that thing the", "98:43", "Tasmanian Tiger that died during human", "98:47", "like modern tops it's a crazy-looking", "98:49", "picture look at its face look at that", "98:51", "mouth on that thing Jesus Christ but", "98:53", "that I believe those things died off in", "98:56", "the days I just typed us in here so that", "98:58", "it's nowt stink but the dingo is", "98:59", "probably the more when did it die", "99:04", "thylacine is now extinct however humans", "99:06", "arrived in Australia at least fifty", "99:07", "thousand years ago and introduced the", "99:09", "dingo about five thousand years ago", "99:10", "mmm-hmm", "99:11", "so maybe those things were eating tank", "99:13", "kangaroos a big part of kangaroos I", "99:17", "guess would probably be catching them", "99:19", "when they're not what they're young but", "99:21", "they carry their young inside their body", "99:23", "in that pouch which makes them different", "99:25", "from any other kind of animal that would", "99:27", "be prey because they can take care of", "99:28", "their their young and bounce away", "99:30", "quickly well this is why so in terms of", "99:32", "large mammals humans killed every single", "99:36", "type of large mammal other than", "99:38", "kangaroos in Australia I think they were", "99:40", "kind of hundreds of different types", "99:41", "originally there's a bunch of different", "99:43", "things other than kangaroos yeah yeah", "99:45", "yeah like one again I don't know maybe", "99:48", "giant koalas let's see mm-hmm", "99:51", "but yeah an apparent my understanding", "99:54", "was the reason for that was because they", "99:56", "didn't have natural predators and so", "99:58", "they just didn't know what to do with", "100:00", "you", "100:00", "yeah so let me examine you know have all", "100:03", "of these like defensive mechanisms right", "100:05", "then also have wolves and coyotes and", "100:08", "bears and all those different things", "100:09", "that are chasing them down that's", "100:11", "interesting that the concept of what's", "100:13", "the most ethical thing to eat I would", "100:15", "think you would think it would be like", "100:17", "mollusks okay so that's it yeah", "100:20", "so I do think it's totally fine to eat", "100:23", "and if well what I say is I don't eat", "100:26", "anything with a brain mm-hm so that", "100:28", "means that oysters mussels clams they", "100:33", "are okay yeah so I got convinced I", "100:35", "didn't used to be like this I got", "100:36", "convinced by an advocate for it's called", "100:39", "bivalve veganism mm-hmm I mean it's not", "100:41", "doesn't make a big difference I don't", "100:42", "really like these things they eat them", "100:44", "occasionally but you don't like like", "100:45", "mussels no really yeah have you ever had", "100:49", "linguine with muscles like at a good", "100:51", "Italian restaurant with a nice red sauce", "100:53", "yeah I mean eat so when they're good", "100:55", "they're fine and when about the really", "100:57", "bad well that's in that case with", "100:59", "everything no something's okay when", "101:02", "they're good they can grouse hamburgers", "101:04", "I mean you can get down the line you", "101:06", "know you could rotten food no but like", "101:08", "you know good pizza is just amazing", "101:11", "pizza Oh like like I feel like might the", "101:14", "very best mussels I'm like mad towards", "101:16", "really yeah oh man you need to go to a", "101:18", "really good Italian restaurant yeah I", "101:20", "ever had linguini with clams", "101:22", "do you like clams so again I just feel I", "101:25", "feel being different about them Oh crazy", "101:27", "you just need to go to a really good", "101:28", "restaurant you guys reading in England", "101:30", "man that's the problem", "101:31", "yeah they don't know how to make Italian", "101:32", "food there yeah that's I mean there's a", "101:36", "few people right now they're screaming", "101:37", "in England I'm a good Italian so you son", "101:39", "of a bitch I'm generalizing and I'm", "101:42", "aware I mean ignorant in saying that", "101:43", "yeah but I can't defend English cuisine", "101:46", "oh great having been out to New York San", "101:48", "Francisco yeah well London has some", "101:51", "amazing restaurants now London does you", "101:53", "know I mean but it was always the the", "101:55", "generalized stereotypical knock was that", "101:58", "the food in England was terrible yeah", "101:59", "the first time I went there was pretty", "102:01", "bad it's often still but yeah with", "102:03", "respect to what's the most ethical meat", "102:04", "I think it is a really interesting", "102:05", "question because I think you know the", "102:08", "debate and vegetarianism and so on it's", "102:09", "normally phase of this either/or thing", "102:11", "like not doing anything or just go", "102:13", "vegetarian", "102:14", "or vegan but I was interested in this", "102:17", "question of just yeah well supposing you", "102:20", "only want to go halfway or of the", "102:22", "different foodstuffs like what are the", "102:24", "what are the ones that gonna do the most", "102:26", "in terms of animal welfare if you cut", "102:28", "them out because most people when they", "102:30", "go halfway to being vegetarian they", "102:33", "might cut out red meat throwing up beef", "102:35", "and so on and I actually think that's if", "102:36", "you care at least about the animal", "102:37", "welfare side of things I think that's", "102:39", "just long and I think there's two", "102:41", "reasons for that one is one it's the", "102:45", "spectre the amount of suffering that the", "102:47", "animal has in the course of its life", "102:49", "where the way that chickens are", "102:53", "currently treated if you look at this", "102:54", "average and again we're talking about", "102:56", "most chickens though you're talking", "102:58", "about factory farming farms and", "103:00", "conditions which is well over 90% things", "103:02", "like 99% for chickens though eaten are", "103:05", "in these conditions their lives just I", "103:08", "think they're the worst off creatures in", "103:09", "the planet basically and cows I think", "103:14", "often don't have great lives", "103:16", "it's just nothing really compared to", "103:18", "chickens and I think pork are similar", "103:19", "like pigs also have really terrible", "103:21", "lives well as large of animals cows", "103:26", "sheep just in general aren't being at", "103:29", "litres badly and then the second", "103:31", "question is how many animals are you", "103:36", "affecting where if you consume a steak", "103:41", "or something that's like a thousandth of", "103:43", "a cow on average well as you can easily", "103:45", "eat kind of half a chicken and that's a", "103:47", "factor that people normally don't", "103:48", "consider as well and obviously maybe you", "103:51", "value a cow's life later the chickens", "103:53", "life or something we do in some strange", "103:55", "way yes a hierarchy yeah we have almost", "103:58", "inherently or at least we do in the", "104:00", "Western world yeah I think it's really", "104:02", "hard to know like this is one of the", "104:03", "hardest philosophical question I've",

are", "113:30", "living just completely confined where", "113:32", "they can't even turn around and they're", "113:33", "just pumping them up with whatever the", "113:35", "fuck they need to keep them alive until", "113:36", "they get to a certain point where they", "113:38", "can kill them yeah and it's through", "113:40", "people so many people would be", "113:42", "absolutely if that was right there in", "113:43", "front of right it would be sickened yeah", "113:45", "hence the ag-gag laws in order to keep", "113:48", "that money coming in they have to keep", "113:49", "people in the dark of these situations", "113:51", "and unless they go online and seek it", "113:54", "out and and watch these videos yeah and", "113:56", "those videos are very polarizing too", "113:58", "because well you know when you come to a", "113:59", "lot of these animal rights organizations", "114:01", "a lot of them have roots in the Animal", "114:03", "Liberation Organization which doesn't", "114:05",

think", "114:40", "well if they have a good life and the", "114:41", "worldly turd just seems fine yeah again", "114:43", "he'd want to say like the focus should", "114:45", "be on suffering yeah on

when hmm I mean so I like", "119:26", "opposed hunting I think that the animal", "119:28", "gets killed but the thing is it's just", "119:31", "so salient compared to factory farming", "119:34", "mmm and it's like you know what I prefer", "119:36", "that people hunt meat love them like", "119:38", "factory farming it's like of course and", "119:39", "like you do the math this like not only",

because those", "126:40", "animals prey on each other they all do", "126:42", "and like what should we be a part of", "126:44", "that", "126:45", "should we take place should we take part", "126:46",

feed", "127:03", "those people in the way that they're", "127:05", "accustomed to eating right now there's a", "127:07", "that's a massive although that's an", "127:09", "battle yeah I think the kind of question", "127:12", "of large populations and how do you feed", "127:14", "them that massively tells in favor of", "127:16", "lower meat consumption or vegetation", "127:17", "sure because you've got this ten to one", "127:19", "we're all aware right to create a", "127:21", "calorie of meat you need tens calories", "127:23", "or more of green or mmm sorry or", "127:27", "whatever you're feeding them unless", "127:29", "you're in dealing with people just", "127:30", "consuming wild pigs yeah wild pigs or", "127:33", "can you lose or something with it that", "127:34", "yeah there are exceptions to that as", "127:35", "well but but I don't think there's", "127:37", "enough to feed people though that's the", "127:38", "other thing there's 350 million people", "127:40", "in this country there's not 350 million", "127:42", "wild pigs exactly but it means that in", "127:46", "the future just as populations get", "127:49", "larger then yeah again we're just gonna", "127:51", "need to use land and energy more", "127:54", "efficiently so this is like yet another", "127:56", "argument in favor of plant-based diets", "128:00", "yeah well in America at least the", "128:04", "majority the vast majority of the money", "128:06", "that goes towards conservation towards", "128:08", "keeping wild animal populations high is", "128:10", "actually from hunting it's a real",

make sure that", "128:33", "numbers right - but of the the money in", "128:37", "in terms of the percentage of sales of", "128:40", "hunting equipment goes directly towards", "128:42", "conservation there's all these things", "128:44", "yeah there's all these different", "128:45", "entities like the Rocky Mountain Elk", "128:47", "Federation that have repopulated elk", "128:49", "into all these areas but done so", "128:52", "specifically so that people can hunt", "128:53", "them so it gets really weird yeah it was", "128:56", "like it might be an uneasy alliance", "128:58", "between in many people's eyes but", "129:01", "they're the ones that are giving up the", "129:02", "money the money is not coming from", "129:03", "altruistic organizations that just want", "129:05", "to preserve

when Columbus landed so it's and", "129:17", "that's all because of conservation", "129:18", "because of hunting so it's another one", "129:21", "of those weird things where the whole", "129:24", "picture yeah there's a solution that", "129:26", "I've heard suggested for reducing", "129:29", "species loss which is to allow basically", "129:35", "ownership of species so you can copy", "129:38", "like the Panda no now isn't this a weird", "129:42", "idea but the idea is that they're now", "129:44", "suddenly like at the moment no one has a", "129:45", "financial incentive to ensure that", "129:48", "pandas don't go extinct whereas if", "129:52", "someone were able to say no I have if", "129:55", "you want to use a panda and video or so", "129:57", "on you have to pay the owner yeah well", "130:00", "I'm very uncomfortable with the idea of", "130:02", "this laboratory created meat as to where", "130:06", "that's going to go why you uncomfortable", "130:07", "I'm very positive about it I mean the", "130:10", "science is kind of tricky but I'm", "130:12", "positive about it in that it's not gonna", "130:14", "be in the animal suffering it's gonna be", "130:15", "fascinating in that regard but what's", "130:18", "gonna happen if we find out that well", "130:22", "there's a bunch of it for things right", "130:23", "first of all we have to make sure that's", "130:24", "healthy we have to make sure that it", "130:26", "doesn't cause some sort of a weird", "130:27", "disease because you're not eating", "130:29", "something that's living and moving and", "130:31", "when you eat sedentary creatures maybe", "130:33", "there's some sort of an adverse impact", "130:35", "on our biology because I think there's", "130:37", "an adverse impact when you eat protein", "130:39", "from an animal that is like weak and", "130:41", "sick and they've actually shown that", "130:44", "there was a study that dr.

health", "131:01", "characteristics I believe it was than", "131:03", "animals that ate younger animals", "131:05", "and there seems to be some sort of a", "131:08", "direct correlation between

see why that", "131:35", "would be a problem I mean at least you'd", "131:38", "think you'd be able to get past that in", "131:39", "fact where you know the meat that we've", "131:41", "currently got started all of antibiotics", "131:44", "you know there's often viruses that or", "131:50", "viruses that kind of arise swine flu", "131:52", "alien flu flu exactly you could avoid", "131:55", "all of them with all that all that stuff", "131:57", "comes from factory farm and in fact yeah", "131:59", "and in fact then once you start to", "132:00", "engineer meat perhaps you could engineer",

development", "132:12", "of any new technology you've got to be", "132:13", "cautious about it but ultimately it", "132:19", "seems like we should be able to get to a", "132:21", "point where we have tastier cheaper more", "132:25", "healthy meat that uses far less carbon", "132:29", "like has far less carbon dioxide as a", "132:31", "side effect uses far less land area it's", "132:34", "gonna be better in every single way hmm", "132:36", "and I mean I think the science it does", "132:39", "seem hard in particular just to get the", "132:40", "costs down low enough well I think", "132:42", "they've got it down pretty low I mean", "132:44", "there was a recent article about it", "132:45", "where they were talking about the", "132:46", "original one was worth hundreds of", "132:47", "thousands of dollars and now they've got", "132:49", "it down to like 20 bucks yeah I think", "132:51", "that was misleading was it yeah it's a", "132:54", "shame like it seemed to me like there's", "132:56", "have been a little bit too much hype", "132:58", "around and weekly mean where yeah", "133:02", "there's some stories of like the costs", "133:03", "are radically going down right well as", "133:05", "it's definitely much lower than that I", "133:08", "think it's definitely still decades away", "133:09", "mmm decades yeah I think so really yeah", "133:12", "what makes you think decades so the", "133:14", "argument is that the currently the so it", "133:17", "depends on what you're talking about", "133:18", "like egg white I think is pretty easy", "133:21", "comparatively milk is comparatively easy", "133:25", "but structured meat so you know steak or", "133:28", "chicken that has a structure that's I", "133:32", "think very difficult and I think", "133:33", "apparently part of what the difficulty", "133:36", "is there's a certain solution that you", "133:38", "need to go with this meat in and that", "133:40", "solution is currently very expensive hmm", "133:42", "and the key part of the cost even once", "133:46", "we get to the point of being able to", "133:47", "develop this getting the cost down low", "133:49", "enough since it's competitive", "133:50", "you're going to need to take this fluid", "133:53", "that currently costs I don't know how", "133:56", "much but like a thousand dollars a liter", "133:57", "get it down to the cost of soda and we", "134:01", "don't click currently it seems have like", "134:03", "a clear kind of scientific who would be", "134:05", "the ultimate conundrum if they found out", "134:07", "that the only way to make that fluid and", "134:09", "to make it financially viable is to make", "134:11", "it out of ground-up pets well get killed", "134:15", "anyway euthanized pets so at like would", "134:17", "people be upset if they took euthanized", "134:19", "pets and they used it to make the fluid", "134:21", "to grow the artificial meat in or would", "134:23", "they prefer those euthanized pets just", "134:25", "be cremated so at the moment that fluid", "134:28", "does have to come from animals why", "134:30", "certain part of it that is animal based", "134:32", "was just guessing so it's not exactly", "134:35", "ground-up pets but is there in still", "134:39", "probably brains as I understand it still", "134:41", "currently not vegan but it's interesting", "134:44", "I think it's going to change I mean I do", "134:45", "think given the level of just model", "134:49", "cognitive dissonance that's currently", "134:50", "going on between people's attitudes to", "134:52", "animals pets any animal

profit", "135:40", "you know other than companies that have", "135:42", "polluted environments that have wanted", "135:45", "poisoning people yeah so in terms of", "135:46", "animals so fifty billion

shortly Scotland did not want to", "148:38", "leave for the you voted overwhelmingly", "148:40", "in favor of remaining so Scotland in", "148:43", "general tends to lean a lot further left", "148:45",

the state part of the Union", "148:59", "there's now gonna be a second referendum", "149:01", "at least this is what Nicola Sturgeon is", "149:03", "saying and because of the brexit vote I", "149:08",

not sure now I think", "149:28", "I probably am in fit because I think", "149:30", "that brexit was just such a bad decision", "149:33", "that I kind of want them to be punished", "149:36", "for that and well I think there's two", "149:38", "things one is that I think that now the", "149:41", "case for Scotland being part of the EU", "149:45", "but not part of it and the economic case", "149:47", "kind of makes a bit more sense now than", "149:49", "it did in the past but then secondly", "149:51", "just I would kind of worry that Britain", "149:55", "leaves the u EU does that trigger kind", "149:57", "of spark like you know much larger", "150:01", "movement we're just the EU as a project", "150:03", "can it breaks down and if it's the case", "150:07", "like well UK leaves the EU but as a", "150:10", "result the country just falls apart", "150:12", "I think you've wanted that to happen you", "150:14", "wanted England to fall apart to be", "150:16", "punished for leaving the I mean you", "150:18", "could be like a very major signal like I", "150:20", "don't think you what if they prospered", "150:22", "if they were correct oh yeah I mean then", "150:25", "if it is if I do go if it was convinced", "150:28", "that the flex it was the right decision", "150:31", "it was actually best for the world and", "150:33", "then I would change my mind I don't know", "150:34", "enough about it but I do have a friend", "150:36", "who's very knowledgeable and he's from", "150:37", "England and his take on it was the the", "150:42", "real issue with the U is that you're", "150:44",

any part of", "151:04", "the European Union and move into it he's", "151:07", "like that was very detrimental and very", "151:09", "bad in terms of the way", "151:11", "England's financial structure was set up", "151:14", "they were like this could this would be", "151:16", "detrimental to England but beneficial to", "151:18", "other places and the idea was that we", "151:20", "were supposed to

doing and in making that", "151:28", "decision they were thought to be", "151:30", "xenophobic they were thought to be you", "151:32", "know nationalistic and that it was", "151:34", "racist so I think this yeah two things I", "151:38", "mean one thing is yeah I don't like yeah", "151:41", "I mean so there's kind of two things one", "151:42", "with respect to the sovereignty question", "151:44", "I mean like European Union like it has", "151:48", "its own Parliament and so on you can", "151:49", "vote on that you each get number those", "151:51", "electors and the reason insofar as it's", "151:54", "undemocratic it's mainly just because", "151:56", "people don't care like that they don't", "151:58", "care well as invited Emma Craddock", "152:00", "but turn as in voters so turnout", "152:03", "elections for many members of the", "152:05", "European Parliament Parliament the", "152:07", "turnout is very low I think the sense of", "152:09", "thing maybe it'll be larger

"well bins leaving so Britain's leaving", "152:18", "so you no longer voting for members of", "152:20", "the P in Parliament so that's one", "152:23", "question and then like is this good a", "152:24", "bad fittin I think like the economic", "152:28", "case is just incredibly strong for your", "152:31", "lip being curve good for Britain the", "152:34", "reason being just like fleet fade and", "152:36", "general benefits both parties you want", "152:38", "to really maximize the amount of free", "152:39", "trade but then the bigger thing for me", "152:42", "is just like with respect to

EU", "155:12", "dictate to us the shape of our bananas", "155:16", "but I think the case is like a good one", "155:18", "it's like it's really not that important", "155:20", "it's just a banana why are they even", "155:22", "sort of regulate it then well it's", "155:24", "because if you want to have like a free", "155:25", "like single market you need to have", "155:27", "common standards across

worry about when they", "156:01", "worry about the bureaucracy ya worry", "156:03", "about too much control yeah so um it's a", "156:05", "great example and in fact if what why", "156:08", "people don't want micromanaging of our", "156:10", "culture yeah but then the question is do", "156:13", "we want to leave over bananas and I", "156:15", "think like there's a lot of other", "156:17",

feel like", "156:51", "they focus on these examples which is", "156:52", "like okay maybe like let's say yeah it's", "156:54", "okay it's a cost we would like to be", "156:56", "able like maybe it would be better if it", "156:58", "and could make decision of manners maybe", "157:01", "the bananas was the bad call what", "157:02", "definitely doesn't seem like a universal", "157:04", "reaction I mean the the there's a large", "157:07", "percentage of the people in England at", "157:09", "are very upset about brexit you know", "157:11", "yeah so it's a really interesting sort", "157:13", "of a divide between people yeah I mean", "157:15", "the thing that I find fascinating is", "157:18", "that we would make and I think this in", "157:21", "general I think this with elections as", "157:23", "well because I studied a bunch of voting", "157:25", "Theory well doing my PhD and we make", "157:28", "these momentous decisions as a country", "157:30", "where we get everyone in the population",

or", "157:41", "no where's there's so much more you", "157:43", "could be doing all right in one case", "157:45", "with a referendum", "157:46", "well than just a particular date where", "157:49", "the turnout is affected by things like", "157:50", "the weather it's affected by you know", "157:54", "what happened in the week before instead", "157:57", "you just have figure referenda and given", "157:59", "the momentum this momentous nosov the", "158:01", "decision spending more money on like", "158:04", "actually getting the accurate views of", "158:06", "the people is super important so instead", "158:09", "yeah you have three over the period of", "158:11", "six months and choose the best you know", "158:14", "their best at free basically well", "158:17", "there's our orders that would be like a", "158:19", "more accurate accurate representation of", "158:21", "what people think of a time sure but", "158:22", "isn't there also a gigantic issue with", "158:24", "people not being informed about what", "158:26", "they're voting on you don't have to be", "158:28", "informed yeah about what you're voting", "158:30", "on you certainly don't have to be", "158:31", "accurate about what you're you could", "158:32", "easily be misled yeah and the actual", "158:34", "hard provable facts could be completely", "158:37", "outside of your grasp and yet you still", "158:38", "make a big decision", "158:40", "I wondered before about having a a test", "158:45", "a test yeah you go like but like really", "158:48", "really basic I think it would still", "158:51", "there's this question of just why do we", "158:53", "care about democracy what's the point", "158:55", "why do we question it seems like a", "158:59", "really important thing", "159:00", "oh yeah political philosophers talk", "159:01", "about this all the time so the kind of", "159:03", "agreed like democracy seems good other", "159:06", "forms of government that we know so far", "159:08", "seem terrible seem terrible or worse but", "159:11", "why why is democracy good is it just", "159:14", "that democracy gives us this way to boot", "159:16", "out dictators", "159:18", "be and the risk of a single person", "159:20", "taking power it's just really really bad", "159:22", "and so we just need some mechanism to", "159:24", "get rid of that is if it's intrinsically", "159:26", "valuable is it that people just have a", "159:30", "right to have equal representation and", "159:32", "that's just this fundamental thing or is", "159:34", "it justified on just in terms of the", "159:37", "consequences is it because if everybody", "159:39", "is able to contribute then people will", "159:41", "make better decisions I never", "159:43", "necessarily think it's an either/or I", "159:44", "think there's also that people like to", "159:46", "feel like they play a part like they", "159:48", "don't want to feel like they're being", "159:49", "ruled over by some monarch they want to", "159:51", "feel like they have some sort of a play", "159:53", "and the decision-making it's also what", "159:55", "one of the gross things about Trump", "159:57", "winning in this country is how many", "159:58", "people gloated", "160:00", "how many people gloat upon victory that", "160:02", "their side won and then you're dealing", "160:04", "with this whole team mentality adopt", "160:06", "when it comes to saw any sort of an", "160:08", "issue well I mean this is Cody Jackson", "160:10", "right yeah no in general this is one of", "160:12", "the things I'm really worried about with", "160:17", "is increasing levels of partisanship", "160:19", "this is just this really robust", "160:21", "phenomenon that we're seeing and it's", "160:23", "really worrying because it means that", "160:25", "we're just undermining any chance of", "160:26", "people changing my mind like someone", "160:28", "like people say well cause economy", "160:30", "except a but like the vast majority of", "160:33", "Tom's voice were and similarly for hello", "160:34", "these votes were from people who just", "160:36", "always vote Republican yes well not", "160:39", "necessarily because the Trump won by so", "160:42", "many votes that a good percentage of", "160:44", "them had to have voted for Obama just", "160:46", "statistically oh and I'm still thinking", "160:50", "of Trump's votes what the portion of", "160:55", "people have only ever voted Republican", "160:58", "to question and I would like definitely", "161:00", "bet greater than 80% I really probably", "161:03", "evacuate over 90% yeah that's like I", "161:04", "mean if you look at the polls like it's", "161:06", "always that in terms of expected it's", "161:11", "only 46% in favor there tom well there's", "161:13", "also the issue that the independence in", "161:15", "the swing states whether it's Gary", "161:17", "Johnson or whether it's Jill Stein those", "161:20", "independents the amount of votes they", "161:22", "got would have swung it the other way", "161:24", "towards Hillary yeah I remember looking", "161:26", "into this for Jill Stein in particular", "161:28", "and actually it was the case she would", "161:30", "have won the popular vote by even more", "161:32", "but in none of the swing states did she", "161:34", "get enough of a percentage not just just", "161:36", "time but Gary Johnson as well yeah", "161:38", "though Gary Johnson it seemed to me was", "161:42", "split almost evenly between Trump and", "161:44", "Hillary but this is an interesting case", "161:46", "so the thing that people yeah I don't", "161:49", "think about so much is like I think the", "161:51", "process we call this is like a democracy", "161:53", "but like one single like checkbox every", "161:59", "four years it's like the smallest amount", "162:01", "of information you can be getting yeah", "162:02", "and it's acceptable to all sorts of", "162:04", "different things for supposing and this", "162:07", "happens on both sides so supposing Jill", "162:08", "Stein became you know really", "162:12", "really popular took 10% of a vote she", "162:15", "would have just killed Hillary", "162:16", "absolutely or suppose and that Evan", "162:19", "McMullen is that his name", "162:21", "yeah he was a Republican independent", "162:24", "okay did well in Utah any was supposing", "162:27", "a far-right candidate does really well", "162:30", "again takes all of the votes away from", "162:31", "them the fact that that's possible shows", "162:35", "that like first-past-the-post is a", "162:37", "voting system is a very bad voting", "162:38", "system yes not accurately representing", "162:40", "the will of the people and we could do", "162:43", "so much better than it would mean that", "162:46", "like as a democratic process you'd be", "162:48", "much closer to representing what people", "162:50", "actually believe or feel about things", "162:53", "because right now it means that yeah you", "162:56", "can be influenced by stuff like how much", "162:57", "support as a third party get that's a", "163:00", "terrible system it's a terrible system", "163:01", "it lasts too long the decisions last for", "163:03", "four years this person gets locked into", "163:05", "position unless you impeach them and", "163:07", "then remove them from office they're", "163:08", "stuck it sucks I wish I could talk about", "163:10", "it more but I can't I gotta get the fuck", "163:12", "out of here but this that's the least", "163:15", "interesting thing we talked about today",
