see a very low", "08:53", "excretion of testosterone so they looked", "08:56", "at that and plotted it out and saw hey", "08:58", "every doper has a very large variance", "09:01", "and testosterone excretion then what", "09:03", "they did is they took all the UFC", "09:05", "samples and they plotted him out by", "09:07", "quarter and actually brought a graph", "09:09", "along with me and it's some really", "09:11", "drastic I think visual evidence of the", "09:14", "success and the impact of this program I", "09:17", "don't know if you can throw that up", "09:18", "would you take a look at it so what what", "09:24", "year exactly did you saw to take over", "09:26", "yeah so we can't you saw it came into", "09:28", "play July of 2015 so you saw has been in", "09:31", "existence for two years so you see here", "09:35", "that first quarter quarter three of 2015", "09:38", "a pretty decent variance there which", "09:41", "means in any given test an athlete you", "09:43", "know was up and an average a little bit", "09:45", "30 a little you know in the mid-20s and", "09:48", "then look it as you plot out that graph", "09:51", "that variance becomes smaller and", "09:53", "smaller and smaller and more in the the", "09:55", "medium range as it gets out to you know", "09:58", "quarter 3 of 2017 that's very", "10:00", "interesting you don't you don't this is", "10:02", "you don't usually see statistics this is", "10:04", "the first I've been involved in", "10:06", "anti-doping world since 2002 and I can", "10:11", "unequivocally say that this is the", "10:13", "strongest

goes to this Coast credit to", "10:24", "the UFC 100% is that they decided to do", "10:26", "something about this they didn't have to", "10:28", "this wasn't like someone coming after", "10:32", "them because you know so many people had", "10:34", "been caught and someone said hey we're", "10:36", "gonna put a program on you guys to make", "10:39", "sure you're not doping of the UFC said", "10:41", "we gotta clean this up and there's", "10:42", "there's only one way the one way is to", "10:45", "go with the very best testing possible", "10:46", "and the most rigorous the most mean", "10:48", "check in everywhere you go we're gonna", "10:51", "give you random tests it's six o'clock", "10:53", "in the morning knock on your door like", "10:54", "the whole the whole full gamut of tests", "10:58", "and the results have been pretty amazing", "10:59", "and that alone that speaks volumes when", "11:03", "you see the size of the variance between", "11:05", "the the test when", "11:07", "first started movies now definitely hey", "11:09", "it's a credit to two people Lorenzo", "11:12", "Fertitta and and Dana white that you", "11:14", "know made that decision that's a hell of",

have a couple", "14:14", "days to a detection window of several", "14:17", "months and this was widely known you", "14:20", "know it wasn't a secret initially they", "14:22", "kept it quiet they went back and", "14:23", "retested some samples and there was a", "14:25", "whole you know a bunch of positives and", "14:27", "then it got out 2013 around it there was", "14:31", "his new test so right up front you know", "14:34", "I've said this a while now is would not", "14:36", "make a lot of sense for an individual", "14:39", "UFC athlete that knew you know", "14:41", "especially you know a

system or the prohibited", "15:12", "substance entered his system you know", "15:14", "sometime after July 7th or 8th and was", "15:18", "likely you know a pretty small amount", "15:20", "and that it

and", "15:39", "we'll see how this plays out right now", "15:42", "where the process is is John and you", "15:43", "sada are working closely I'm aware that", "15:46", "there was a meeting a week or two ago", "15:48", "pretty lengthy meeting which I was told", "15:51", "was productive I wasn't given details of", "15:53", "what productive meant but I think that's", "15:56", "an important thing right now and that", "15:58", "John's falling through with is to", "15:59", "retrace all of his steps between that", "16:02", "you know just last July 8th positive", "16:04", "test and our negative tests and the", "16:06", "positive test on July 29th of July 30th", "16:08", "it certainly seems like based on what", "16:12", "you just said that this is something", "16:14", "that was accidentally taken but if you", "16:16", "can't prove that something was", "16:18", "accidentally taken like if you can't", "16:19", "nail it down what do you what happens", "16:22", "yeah it's it's difficult and that's you", "16:24", "know that's kind of the nightmare", "16:25", "scenario that a lot of you know that an", "16:27", "athlete can face and a big role of what", "16:29", "Don and I do to prevent

consequences so yeah we'll see", "16:52", "where this plays out I tell you the one", "16:54", "thing that I can say about this is you", "16:56", "know this is obviously John's second", "16:58", "time in the program with testing", "17:01", "positive and in the first time he went", "17:03", "through pretty lengthy appeal process", "17:06", "and there was a publicly issued decision", "17:10", "50 60 pages that went through all the", "17:12", "evidence that that the independent", "17:17", "arbitrators heard and and decided on and", "17:20", "what they said definitively in that case", "17:23", "was

you", "40:32", "guys have a hypoxic room where you can", "40:34", "stimulate or simulate a high altitude", "40:37", "yeah I think 22,000 feet but isn't the", "40:39", "way you're supposed to do it you're", "40:41", "supposed to work at sea level but sleep", "40:43", "at high altitude isn't how it's supposed", "40:45", "to think that's what it is you know what", "40:47", "is beso 2500 3000 feet so I think it is", "40:53", "yeah I thought it was a little I thought", "40:56", "it was like sea level because it's like", "40:57", "desert no no no it's got a little bit", "40:59", "altitude I know Nevada has some good", "41:01", "mountain areas though just outside where", "41:03", "guys can run and do things like that", "41:05", "yeah", "41:06", "does the Performance Institute take", "41:07",

"41:15", "you go it's a good idea I mean I just", "41:17", "think that if really high level coaches", "41:19", "start moving there and obviously we just", "41:21", "lost one of the best Robert foulest", "41:22", "which is a huge huge loss and what a", "41:25", "great guy and say I mean universally the", "41:28", "nicest guy ever always a great demeanor", "41:30", "they loved very few people that are", "41:32", "fight coaches that are universally loved", "41:34", "and Robert really was but you know Vegas", "41:36", "has some good coaches but I I anticipate", "41:39", "more and more gyms moving and relocating", "41:41", "there and bringing fighters there", "41:42", "because I just think high level fighters", "41:43", "gonna see that place and go how can I", "41:45", "recreate this anywhere without fucking", "41:47", "millions and millions of dollars I think", "41:49", "so I mean we'd love to see that happen", "41:51", "it's you know good low costs relatively", "41:53", "low cost a living area so it's a place", "41:55", "that's affordable and yeah I think you", "41:59", "spend a little bit of time at the PI and", "42:00", "see what you can do what it can do for", "42:01", "you as a UFC athlete and then I was good", "42:04", "I think", "42:05", "the cool thing and I know Duncan French", "42:07", "he's dr. Duncan French he's our VP of", "42:09", "performance there and which he explained", "42:13", "a little bit to you about is that not", "42:16", "only are we looking to influence the UFC", "42:18", "athlete but also influenced positively", "42:20", "MMA to hold the entire sport and what", "42:24", "you're seeing is UFC athletes can come", "42:27", "in there and use it but they can also", "42:28", "bring along with them training partners", "42:30", "coaches and you know we're only seven or", "42:33", "eight months into this but what we've", "42:35", "already seen as you know training ideas", "42:37", "proper nutrition", "42:39", "going back out to these gyms not only", "42:42", "across the US but across the world so we", "42:45", "definitely hope to be a positive", "42:46",

half years worth developing", "43:36", "that trust it's a nickname that doesn't", "43:38", "even make sense it literally doesn't", "43:40", "make sense but it's funny is there any", "43:42", "other plans to expand or do more things", "43:46", "with the Institute there is so we didn't", "43:48", "show you this but there are other areas", "43:49", "upstairs for that very reason they", "43:52", "thought about hey technology in a couple", "43:54", "years there may be new machines or", "43:56", "devices that come on the line that we", "43:57", "may want so there is additional room for", "44:00", "expansion there I talked to you guys and", "44:02", "I talked to Duncan about a tank about", "44:04", "you guys getting tanks in there sensory", "44:07", "deprivation tanks I think that would be", "44:08", "massive I know a lot of football teams", "44:09", "are using them now and it's starting to", "44:11", "spread excellent source of magnesium", "44:13", "because you're absorbing it through the", "44:15", "skin but just for relaxation or", "44:17", "recuperation I would be", "44:18", "fascinated to see if you guys had those", "44:21", "like what kind of results yeah bounded", "44:23", "to me and I was there when you're", "44:24", "talking about it that Duncan was open to", "44:26", "it and was talking about some research", "44:28", "and he's the ohio state university is", "44:30", "conducting some research on the benefits", "44:31", "of that so I know there's tanks in Vegas", "44:33", "now I know there's a place in Vegas so", "44:35", "I'm sure whoever runs that tank thing is", "44:38", "gonna reach out to me so I want to get", "44:39", "you in touch with them and just have you", "44:41", "try it just see if you you know just", "44:44", "just to get a beat on yourself it's a", "44:45", "freaky experience and it's really good", "44:47", "for your body just everything like in", "44:49", "your back will just sort of just loosen", "44:51", "up because you're a essentially zero", "44:53", "gravity you're floating and it's just", "44:54", "everything sort of pops and loosens up", "44:56", "and it's amazing it's cool I want to try", "44:58", "to saw yours a

basement I was like people come", "45:06", "over they think you're a freak I'm a", "45:09", "freak but the idea behind it I think", "45:13", "it's pretty sound and I think there's a", "45:15", "lot of benefits for it for fighters as", "45:17", "far as concentrating on technique as", "45:19", "well I think it's an amazing place to", "45:21", "focus on strategy and game plans and", "45:24", "movement

once but I saw a", "49:12", "fighter show up Fight Night outside the", "49:16", "locker room and basically said I don't", "49:18", "want to go in I don't want to do this at", "49:20", "the arena real and I mean I was just", "49:24", "blown away and actually Sean Shelby went", "49:27", "up and thought it was awesome had a", "49:29", "great conversation with the fighter said", "49:31", "look you're not feeling anything that", "49:34", "everybody doesn't feel every single", "49:36", "fighter on the roster feels what you're", "49:38", "feeling right now you're just letting it", "49:40", "get the

body responds very poorly to the", "59:11", "weight cut and then immediately wants to", "59:12", "gain weight afterwards yeah do you think", "59:14", "that that's some sort of like an", "59:17",

at", "60:12", "University of Notre Dame in Southend", "60:13", "Indiana and they were looking into you", "60:17", "know traumatic brain injury and football", "60:19", "and possible therapy and they came", "60:23", "across a clinic in San Diego that was", "60:24", "using this therapy an fda-approved", "60:26", "device it's basically low-level magnet", "60:29", "therapy in conjunction with that

"60:41", "readings back together and I think very", "60:45", "early in in the process of figuring out", "60:48", "whether this can really work or not but", "60:50", "you know certainly with the UFC wants to", "60:53", "be as ahead of the curve in terms of", "60:55", "potential therapies out there for you", "60:57", "know for treating the brain and so yeah", "61:01", "cats been going there for a while and", "61:03", "you know as said she says she's", "61:06", "experienced some positive results yeah", "61:08", "she told me she got some outstanding", "61:09", "results and what's interesting is", "61:11", "there's been a ton of research and", "61:13", "studies done on transdermal stimulation", "61:16", "all these different ways to increase the", "61:19", "the brain's ability to learn and there", "61:22", "was a radio lab podcast on this I think", "61:25", "it was called something 9-volt see if he", "61:27", "could find it 9-volt something another", "61:28", "but it basically detailed how they use", "61:31", "this for a sniper simulation and what", "61:35", "they did is they took this woman who was", "61:36", "a reporter they put her through this", "61:39", "sniper simulation game took a video game", "61:42", "she scored poorly and then yeah 9-volt", "61:45", "nirvana", "61:46", "Thank You Jamie and so then they", "61:48", "attached these electrodes to various", "61:51", "areas of her head and stimulated her", "61:54", "brain with", "61:55", "small charge and she went through the", "61:57", "exact same thing and she said it felt", "61:59", "like the 20 minutes went by in two", "62:02", "minutes and her score was perfect and", "62:05", "this is being echoed throughout like", "62:08", "many different people that have done", "62:11", "tests on these very and there's a lot of", "62:13", "like home hacking where people are", "62:15", "literally going a radio lab and making", "62:17", "their own setups but I'm curious to see", "62:20", "if the UFC has looked into some of these", "62:22", "things like some like maybe perhaps", "62:23", "there's a way you could stimulate the", "62:27", "body's ability to learn certain", "62:29", "techniques or like carve pathways by", "62:32", "stimulating areas of the brain yeah man", "62:34", "another great reason for you to get", "62:35", "Duncan in here because he can talk real", "62:37", "knowledge would be about this therapy he", "62:39", "told me when at the University of Notre", "62:40", "Dame you know they'd have they've had", "62:42", "football players that would you know", "62:43", "have migraine headaches

have had traumatic brain", "63:22", "injuries because of you know IEDs and", "63:25", "I've seen some success there so I mean I", "63:28", "think some real exciting potential there", "63:30", "that again you know the UFC wants to be", "63:33", "at the forefront of and you know be the", "63:35", "first to you know to suggest some of", "63:38", "these things for our athletes and you", "63:40", "know potentially even looking getting", "63:41", "some of these devices at the p.i and be", "63:44", "able to treat some of our athletes there", "63:46", "yeah that would be amazing and I think", "63:48", "that we're in an interesting time now", "63:50", "where because so much research is being", "63:53", "put on CTE and traumatic brain injuries", "63:55", "that we're looking at potential ways

interesting", "71:18", "also about the UFC Performance Institute", "71:19", "is there's a lot of different things", "71:22", "that you guys have devised or have you", "71:24", "know you guys have

like it just seems like the", "71:58", "floors moving you got a jacket you know", "72:00", "basically it's a rising floor so you", "72:02", "rise up to the top you step on it and", "72:04", "then it drops down and it works like a", "72:06", "regular treadmill because you're but", "72:08", "because you're underwater you're putting", "72:10", "less stress on obviously your lower", "72:12", "extremities and if you notice also", "72:14", "there's cameras underwater with a TV", "72:16", "screen right in front of of the person", "72:19", "using and the idea there is if you have", "72:21", "an ankle injury or a knee injury you", "72:24", "could take a look at how your foots", "72:25", "coming down and are you favoring it and", "72:27", "what your your gait looking like it's a", "72:29", "really cool piece of equipment Conor was", "72:31", "using that quite a bit and in the run-up", "72:33", "to to Floyd he put a lot of stuff out", "72:35", "there on social media on that thing I", "72:36", "think you liked it yeah well he's got a", "72:37", "bum knee right he's got an ego that has", "72:39", "had he's had some issues with in the", "72:41", "past or there it is there it is that's", "72:43", "done there's a Duncan French off there", "72:46", "to the right thing just drops you down", "72:47", "and then you run on that thing yep yeah", "72:51", "oh man I'm not a hundred percent sold on", "72:53", "that to be honest well that's why you", "72:55", "should come out and get it get on it I", "72:56", "mean I'm sure it's difficult but I think", "72:57", "that like actually carrying your", "73:00", "and running on hills is a winner yeah", "73:03", "probably now look if you're coming off", "73:05", "an ACL surgery right and you know you're", "73:08", "taking baby steps to get back to running", "73:10", "mm-hmm it's probably there otherwise if", "73:12", "if you're healthy and you know training", "73:14", "for a fight coming up in a couple weeks", "73:16", "I don't know if that's necessarily the", "73:18", "quitting it for you he's a guy that I'm", "73:20", "puzzled by Connor obviously I'm a", "73:22", "gigantic fan but man his cardio it seems", "73:25", "like there's a thing there there's", "73:27", "something there whether it's the style", "73:28", "that he fights the explosive sprinting", "73:31", "style that he fights it's unsustainable", "73:33", "you know or whether or not there seems", "73:35", "to be some sort of an issue that that", "73:37", "needs to be addressed some much more", "73:40", "radical approach to strength and", "73:42", "conditioning and I would love to see the", "73:44", "guys that Performance Institute try to", "73:45", "tackle that and try to figure out I mean", "73:47", "I'm sure they've run vo2 max is on them", "73:49", "and but yes he did most of his camp", "73:52", "there but you know he had his own team", "73:54", "around him it was kind of directing and", "73:56", "but in his defense this was a very quick", "73:58", "camp sure you're getting ready for a", "74:00", "12-round fight with the greatest fighter", "74:01", "of all time in boxing Jesus Christ it", "74:03", "was like six or seven weeks I think", "74:05", "Floyd knew what he was doing I tell you", "74:07", "one of the incredible things about that", "74:08", "and there wasn't a lot said about it", "74:10", "going back to kind of my world", "74:11", "anti-doping world so Floyd does this for", "74:14", "all his fights he basically hires you", "74:16", "sada to do testing it's not you know", "74:20", "it's not the same as a UFC program where", "74:22", "you're subject to testing year-round in", "74:24", "boxing once the fight is made you saw it", "74:27", "then comes in and does collecting so it", "74:29", "depends on how far out the fight was", "74:31", "made but Conor and Floyd signed that", "74:33", "contract was it seven weeks out maybe", "74:36", "they were each tested 16 times in that", "74:39", "seven weeks and I guarantee you they are", "74:42", "the two most tested athletes in that", "74:44", "period of time ever in the history of", "74:47", "anti-doping so not only was it a", "74:49", "incredibly cool event but I think", "74:51", "incredibly clean cool and clean for the", "74:54", "fans to know that you know how out of", "74:56", "the way those two guys went to ensure", "74:58", "that that fight was fair and clean that", "75:00", "is amazing good enough credit for that", "75:01", "it's too bad there's not two performance", "75:04", "Institute's you could have one right", "75:05", "next to each other or opponents could", "75:07", "train at very you know like you could", "75:09", "film things at the performance Institute", "75:11", "in at a level", "75:13", "Forrest Griffin was showing me how the", "75:15", "octagon is set up with 360-degree", "75:18", "cameras and you could literally film and", "75:21", "then rotate angles up down you can you", "75:25", "can move around and show oh when you're", "75:29", "throwing this punch your back foot is", "75:30", "coming off the ground when you are", "75:31", "leaning to your left you're dropping", "75:33", "your hand yeah it's like it's like the", "75:35", "John Madden telestrator you stop action", "75:37", "and draw on that huge big screen next we", "75:39", "got to get around exactly when Floyd was", "75:42", "shown or excuse me when Forrest was", "75:44", "showing me how you can move it around I", "75:46", "was like this is insane like this what a", "75:48", "tool this is for technique development", "75:50", "it really and I think we're at the", "75:51", "infancy of these coaches coming in and", "75:53", "figuring out how they can use these", "75:55", "things is that that they can benefit", "75:57", "their players I mean that there it is", "75:59", "right there", "76:00", "yeah this thing oh there's my tour well", "76:02", "did somebody put that up on yeah oh yeah", "76:08", "put it on my in stories but I didn't put", "76:11", "it on YouTube somebody put it on YouTube", "76:12", "here so what what force was showing me", "76:15", "was how they can pause it in slow-mo and", "76:18", "back it up and then change angles and", "76:20", "that all the fighters sparring sessions", "76:23", "are filmed there filmed from an overhead", "76:25", "they're filmed from the sides and", "76:26", "there's cameras all around the Octagon I", "76:30", "mean it's just what a facility man yeah", "76:33", "I mean I really think we talked about", "76:35", "this is just bringing this sport the", "76:37", "whole new level", "76:37", "yeah well Francis is going to be your", "76:40", "first test tube sort of child yeah you", "76:45", "know you talked about wouldn't it be", "76:47", "nice to have two opponents working", "76:48", "side-by-side but the PI has that", "76:50", "capability I mean as you saw it it's set", "76:52", "up specifically so you have certain", "76:54", "things downstairs and certain things", "76:56", "upstairs so you'd have to schedule so", "76:57", "steep a says hey man I want to come out", "76:59", "and use this it is it is open to steep a", "77:01", "we could schedule it so steep Bay's", "77:03", "downstairs doing a strength and", "77:04", "conditioning while Francis is upstairs", "77:06", "it's a lot of what force does force you", "77:09", "know could be the intermediary to make", "77:10", "sure", "77:11", "Francis goes out one door steep it comes", "77:13", "in another never run into themselves but", "77:15", "that definitely has taken them and they", "77:16", "are there but yeah but what if I was T", "77:18", "pay I would not want to be doing", "77:19", "strength conditioning and then in", "77:21", "between sets you just like have your ear", "77:22", "and you hear", "77:27", "Frances is hitting the heavy bag and", "77:29", "scaring everybody you've styled you", "77:33", "tried that", "77:33", "that punch thing machine yeah he's got", "77:35", "the world-record punch on that there's a", "77:37", "what it is is like for folks it's a path", "77:40", "it's adjustable it moves up and down and", "77:42", "you punch it and not only did he break", "77:45", "the world record he broke it by several", "77:47", "thousand pounds per square inch yes I", "77:51", "think his reading and I don't know what", "77:52", "the reading is was a hundred and", "77:54", "twenty-nine thousand something and his", "77:57", "tariff it is you hit it a couple of", "77:59", "times man I thought you were hitting", "78:01", "pretty hard now what did you register", "78:02", "like a thirty five or forty thousand I", "78:04", "got forty six as my hardest one tire man", "78:08", "you kind of put gloves on to do that too", "78:10", "I would imagine that being wrapped up", "78:12", "and that's an argument that I've had", "78:14", "many times when it comes to MMA in", "78:16", "general I like how you can angle it so", "78:18", "you can throw an uppercut as well that's", "78:20", "an argument that I've had for MMA in", "78:23", "general I think it's weird that we are", "78:27", "allowed to elbow with no pad knee with", "78:30", "no pad kick with no pad on the shin but", "78:34", "the knuckles are protected and I think", "78:36", "that it really probably allows people to", "78:40", "deliver more damage with the knuckles", "78:42", "padded I don't think padded knuckles", "78:44", "helps your opponent as much as it helps", "78:46", "you and especially wrist protection like", "78:49", "when I was trying to punch that thing", "78:51", "with just my bare hands which is stupid", "78:54", "especially when you haven't warmed up", "78:56", "right but you're you realize like your", "78:58", "wrist moves around you slam into that", "79:00", "thing if you're hitting it hard your", "79:02", "wrist moves around well that's the case", "79:03", "when you're punching a person to it you", "79:05", "have to be much more precise with where", "79:08", "you're targeting and what you're hitting", "79:10", "you can't hit foreheads and elbows", "79:12", "you'll break your hand like very easily", "79:13", "and I wonder it's just it seems barbaric", "79:16", "to people to fight bare knuckle which to", "79:20", "me is kind of crazy because you're", "79:21", "kicking like you're shinning people in", "79:23", "the head like I don't understand like we", "79:26", "have this weird sort of childish view of", "79:28", "like what should and shouldn't be legal", "79:30", "elbows are some of the hardest I mean", "79:34", "you can just do that with an L and it", "79:35", "doesn't hurt at all", "79:36", "you know your knees your shins those", "79:39", "guys that aspire Muay Thai for years and", "79:42", "years their shins develop calcification", "79:45", "all over the top where they can kick", "79:47", "baseball bats like there's trees yeah", "79:49", "there's a great one of bull cow kicking", "79:52", "banana tree just going crate and he's", "79:55", "one of the greatest Thai fighters of all", "79:57", "time but he's he's chopping at this", "79:59", "banana tree and cuts it in half and like", "80:00", "Jesus like how is it okay that that guy", "80:03", "can kick someone in the face with that", "80:04", "but you have to have pads here he is", "80:07", "right here like give me some volume on", "80:09", "this it's not doing that with his bare", "80:24", "knuckle I'll tell you that that's insane", "80:31", "fuck getting hit in the face with that", "80:33", "but see the difference like that's hard", "80:36", "bone yeah it's no padding why do you", "80:39", "have to have padding on your knuckles", "80:40", "but you don't have to have it on your", "80:41", "chins and your knees and your elbows", "80:44", "that seems to me to be a silly way of", "80:48", "approach yeah yeah I mean maybe we could", "80:51", "pad up everything then people get mad", "80:53", "yeah like we're Pusa for the sport I", "80:55", "think you go the other way I think you", "80:57", "don't pad up anything I think you pad up", "80:59", "your dick and that's it that's what I", "81:01", "think pad up your teeth pad up your dick", "81:02", "let her rip", "81:04", "I really think they should fight bare", "81:05", "knuckle I just don't think it makes any", "81:07", "sense whatsoever especially considering", "81:09", "the fact that I pokes are one of the", "81:11", "major considerations right you're not", "81:12", "going to mitigate that with those gloves", "81:14", "you just yeah you know unless they", "81:15", "develop some sort of a new design where", "81:18", "the gloves are much more curled in yeah", "81:20", "there there's the the eye pokes always", "81:23", "going to be an issue it would be the", "81:24", "exact same issue if you had bare knuckle", "81:26", "well yeah I mean now you can take away", "81:28", "with the new unified rules which", "81:29", "ironically enough aren't unified yeah so", "81:33", "we go from commission a commission and", "81:35", "you know a fighter would have to inform", "81:38", "them fight week hey what are the rules", "81:40", "here that's so unfair yeah to these", "81:42", "fighters that you know are training and", "81:44", "developing that instinct to some of", "81:46", "these rules but anyway the new unified", "81:48", "rules which aren't unified", "81:50", "anybody who's extending the fingers that", "81:52", "the referee has to warn them first but", "81:54", "if they continue to do that a point can", "81:55", "be taken away I think they should take a", "81:57", "point every time a guy gets poked in the", "81:59", "eye and my thought process is even if", "82:02", "it's unintentional the damage has been", "82:03", "done and if you can see it on the replay", "82:06", "legitimate I poke and you see the guy", "82:08", "wincing like we've seen many many times", "82:10", "that guy's compromised and I think that", "82:13", "it's only fair that a point be taken", "82:15", "away even if it was unintentional well", "82:16", "it's like you know kicking or needing a", "82:18", "down fighter to that you know you have", "82:20", "to show intent to take a point away well", "82:22", "how is the referee gonna get in the head", "82:24", "of a fighter to say whether or not that", "82:26", "was intentional right it should almost", "82:28", "be I think that if it's done a points", "82:30", "taken away I agree remove the intent", "82:32", "from it because the damage is already", "82:34", "done at that point yeah it doesn't", "82:35", "matter whether or not it's intentional I", "82:37", "mean we're not putting the blame on the", "82:38", "fighter it's just it happened it's one", "82:40", "of the unfortunate things but the", "82:42", "fighter that got hit is the one who", "82:43",

that is wrong we're gonna go", "90:27", "back and look at her biological profile", "90:29", "and we'll share that with Texas we'll", "90:32", "take a look at these te readings over", "90:34", "the time of the samples that she's", "90:35", "submitted sure enough most of the", "90:38", "samples were mildly elevated and sure", "90:40", "enough you saw too did the right thing", "90:42", "and they went and did that back up", "90:43", "every time they did it she was negative", "90:45", "so they reached out to Texas said hey", "90:49", "we'll share this information with you", "90:50", "and and our historical records this girl", "90:52", "does have a naturally occurring mildly", "90:55", "elevated te ratio then went through a", "90:58", "several week process of figuring out hey", "91:00",

it", "91:43", "takes to get someone to do the right", "91:44", "thing it does so this poor girl is", "91:46", "living with the fact that she's labeled", "91:47", "as a cheater for two to three months", "91:49", "talked about she still will be yeah it's", "91:52", "one of those things like once someone", "91:53", "says you're a steroid cheater okay", "91:56", "always she talked I mean she

those last couple months I think", "92:30", "that was just stylistic you know I just", "92:33", "think you do it the way she matched up", "92:35", "with Felice Herrig was just those two", "92:37",

I", "92:51", "like her a lot and I got to tell you", "92:52", "there's one of the most satisfying", "92:54", "things again going back to the go", "92:56", "snitch thing really my role here is as",

"93:26", "other it's not a team sport worth one", "93:27", "person test positive you have another", "93:29", "person you know to step on in so a lot", "93:32", "of what I've done over those first you", "93:33", "know a couple years is take a look at", "93:35", "you know hey we took we think was a", "93:37", "pretty good shot at the rules to begin", "93:38", "with but look and see how those rules", "93:40", "played themselves out as time went on", "93:42", "and after about a year and a half there", "93:44", "were a couple instances where I saw hey", "93:46", "this isn't quite fair to an athlete we", "93:49", "need to change that we did so after a", "93:51", "year and a half there was a couple rules", "93:52", "that we change the first one there's", "93:54", "kind of a funny story behind this too", "93:55", "was on if you remember when Nate fought", "93:58", "Conor I think the second time he goes to", "94:01", "the press conference after and takes out", "94:03", "a vape pen do you remember that and", "94:05", "someone asked him what he was doing he", "94:07", "said he was with CBD and at the time the", "94:12", "the rule was the in competition period", "94:15", "where CBD was prohibited lasted until", "94:18", "four hours after the conclusion of the", "94:20", "fight and he was clearly within that", "94:21", "time period so you saw two contacted me", "94:25", "and said hey you know technically Nate", "94:27", "was in violation of this and I said hey", "94:29", "look this was not the intent of the rule", "94:31", "this is you know and they never", "94:33", "indicated that they were going to", "94:34", "sanction him but I made it clear explain", "94:37", "CBD for anybody that might not know what", "94:39", "we're talking about sure so CBD is part", "94:41", "of the you know the marijuana plant but", "94:43", "it's not psychoactive part of it I know", "94:46", "a lot of our fighters anecdotally use it", "94:49", "for anti-inflammatory purposes I think I", "94:55", "mean have you ever used it or yes what", "94:56", "what other benefits is anxiety it's it's", "95:00", "great for people that are under stress", "95:01", "it it actually has a great response for", "95:04", "that I know a lot of people that use it", "95:06", "just for anxiety but anti-inflammation", "95:09", "is", "95:09", "is a big one that's the big one people", "95:11", "use it for penny with arthritis you love", "95:12", "it", "95:13", "yeah again comparing to if you know a", "95:14", "natural plant derived product versus a", "95:16", "synthetic you know nonsteroidal", "95:18", "antiinflammatory advils tylenols can be", "95:21", "terrible toxic Anja yeah probably common", "95:24", "sense would would you know in addition", "95:26", "to science would say that the T V DS may", "95:28", "be a little bit healthier for you", "95:29", "nevertheless it was prohibited in", "95:31", "competition is it still no so that was", "95:34", "actually a rule change the wada", "95:36", "prohibited list which we followed took", "95:38", "it completely off the prohibited list", "95:40", "start at the mains in 2018 so that's", "95:42", "great so these take CBD the entire time", "95:45", "they're training there's no it's", "95:46", "obviously there's no performance benefit", "95:48", "there's no psychoactive effect it just", "95:50", "reduces inflammation and it doesn't a", "95:52", "natural way way healthier and it was the", "95:54", "case before if they could do it in", "95:55", "training was only prohibited in", "95:56", "competition so weigh-in day and fight", "95:58", "day now it's completely been taken off", "96:00", "the list and it's okay to use it anytime", "96:02", "that's fantastic that's fantastic so it", "96:04", "was good so but we identified a problem", "96:06", "with with the rules in that when Nate", "96:08", "finished that that fight with Connor you", "96:11", "saw it came to the post-fight medical", "96:13", "tent said Nate we need to make a", "96:14", "collection from you and I don't know", "96:15", "whether it was blood or urine but they", "96:17", "got a sample from him he then went to", "96:19", "the press conference after and was on", "96:21", "you know took the CVD what I said is", "96:24", "look you can't punish him you have the", "96:27", "sample that shows what was in his system", "96:29", "yes CBD was prohibited in competition", "96:31", "but you have a sample to show whether or", "96:33", "not he was using it right it's clear", "96:35", "that you know he was using it after the", "96:36", "fight we just put those extra four hours", "96:38", "in there why with the thought of if a", "96:41", "fighter finishes a fight and somehow you", "96:42", "saw it is not able to get to him say", "96:45", "gets an ambulance right away it goes to", "96:46", "the hospital you increased that window", "96:48", "just in case they can't get them come to", "96:51", "find out as we started putting this", "96:52", "program together you saw it can always", "96:54", "get to that fight or after if they're", "96:55", "transported they can hop in the", "96:57", "ambulance with them it it wasn't an", "96:59", "issue where we needed those extra four", "97:01", "months so we changed that rule and now", "97:03", "basically the rule is the in competition", "97:07", "period ends with a collection", "97:08", "immediately after the fight or you know", "97:11", "you saw it has a reasonable amount of", "97:12", "time after the fight so the funny thing", "97:16", "is after we change this rule Nate and", "97:19", "Nick Diaz come to a fight and they're", "97:21", "sitting", "97:22", "called the zoo for section you know kind", "97:24", "of Danish section right there behind", "97:25", "Danis table so I go over to Nick and", "97:28", "Nate I say hey Nate man hey we changed", "97:30", "that rule", "97:31", "you know the whole CBD thing and", "97:33", "actually we kind of refer to it as as", "97:35",

one cuz I", "98:45", "don't want to fight I think he does I", "98:48", "think he does I mean we've you know I've", "98:50", "sat down with him over the last couple", "98:51", "months and talking about trying to", "98:53", "resolve this whereabouts issue I mean", "98:54", "the unfortunate thing there's look the", "98:56", "whereabouts failure sanctions are meant", "98:59", "to catch people that are

your", "126:51", "performance so if you tell them hey look", "126:54", "if you can come to you know your proper", "126:58", "weight and a more measured approach and", "127:01", "not lose a whole bunch and put that what", "127:03", "look look at the difference is gonna", "127:04", "make on your performance 24 to 30 hours", "127:07", "later cuz you see this I mean you see", "127:10", "this

of", "127:33", "areas explain that for people no no", "127:35", "we're talking yeah so actually Andy", "127:37", "foster again California before UFC 199", "127:40", "came to me and said hey we've been doing", "127:42", "this morning way and for a couple", "127:44", "regional local shows would you guys be", "127:46", "interested in it where we do it at the", "127:48", "host hotel we do it you know we'd open", "127:51", "the scales from 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m.", "127:53", "and the idea would be a fighter gets on", "127:56", "weight in their hotel room upstairs", "127:58", "hops on the elevator

with the idea of I think one of", "128:09", "the dangers of you know weight cutting", "128:11", "and being dehydrated is the amount of", "128:13", "time that you're at a you know at a loss", "128:15",

"way ends at four o'clock in an arena", "128:25", "the fire would the fighter would check", "128:27", "in downstairs maybe two 2:30 the bus", "128:31", "would leave a member in Rio we're and", "128:33", "one time on a bus for an hour hour and a", "128:35", "half to the arena everybody's depleted", "128:37", "and dehydrated on the bus ride you step", "128:40", "on a scale and a cold you know", "128:42", "environmentally unfriendly arena you", "128:45", "then get back on the bus drive another", "128:47", "hour hour and a half you're talking", "128:48", "multiple hours where these fighters are", "128:50", "in a depleted State so I think the", "128:53", "morning way and protects against that I", "128:54", "think the other benefit we've seen out", "128:56", "of it I think it's more of a long-term", "128:57", "than a short-term benefit is we've seen", "128:59", "a lot more fighters missing weight since", "129:02", "we went to the morning weigh-ins and I", "129:04", "think that's a product of timing in that", "129:07", "in the past you had four you know four", "129:09", "or five in the afternoon you had all day", "129:10", "long to cut weight and you would see", "129:12", "fighters at 10:00 or 11:00 saying I", "129:14", "can't do any more and a 1 or 2 o'clock I", "129:17", "said I can do a couple more pounds and", "129:18", "just all day long now unless you're", "129:20", "literally not sleeping the night before", "129:21", "you fight you have a shorter window in", "129:24", "the morning to do that and I think a lot", "129:26", "of those miss weights has helped", "129:27", "identify those fighters that I'm", "129:29", "probably in the right long weight class", "129:31", "I can't make that weight I've waken up", "129:33", "you know five or six in the morning a", "129:34", "couple hours and it's probably too much", "129:36", "weight to lose and we've seen some", "129:38", "fighters move up in weight class because", "129:39", "of that we've also seen some fighters", "129:41", "that have decided hey I got to take this", "129:43", "more professionally and hire a", "129:45", "nutritionist like khabib could be the", "129:47", "number command off

to go to the hospital to", "129:56", "be rehydrated yeah I mean I again I", "129:58", "don't think it's a one-size-fits-all", "130:00", "solution you have to be careful hey be", "130:02", "miss weight that last time went to the", "130:04", "hospital you know a knee-jerk reaction", "130:05", "would be you can't fight right this wait", "130:08", "anymore what we saw this time he just", "130:09",

"131:18", "whole so you sada came to us early this", "131:21", "year and said we've got some new", "131:22", "technology what what do you guys think", "131:24", "about using your program to be the first", "131:26", "to kind of roll it out and so the answer", "131:29", "was well is the science good is it", "131:31", "validated they said yeah it is I was", "131:34", "actually at a at a conference midsummer", "131:37", "back in New York and sat on a panel with", "131:39", "Major League Baseball PGA Tour and the", "131:42", "UFC and a bunch of anti-doping", "131:44", "scientists there and they

think enough there", "131:54", "and they went to me I'm like absolutely", "131:55", "if you saw the science tells me this", "131:57", "this works we want to be the first", "131:59", "especially if it's more convenient and", "132:01", "more efficient for our program so what", "132:03", "this is is it's a leeching device and", "132:06", "you know until this came out basically", "132:09", "to get any blood tests from shit you got", "132:12", "some scissors I yeah nice that was ready", "132:16", "for you", "132:17", "and tell this came out basically any", "132:21", "blood test done from from our athlete", "132:24", "had to be done for the phlebotomist the", "132:26", "full-on needle in the vein take out a", "132:28", "vial of blood so with this leeching", "132:30", "device it's got 30 micro needles in it", "132:34", "size about an eyelash you put it up on", "132:37", "your arm you hit this button and", "132:39", "painlessly the micro needles reach into", "132:42", "just the capillary so just the blood at", "132:44", "the top of the of the", "132:46", "scan and draw out a small amount of", "132:48", "blood and this this light turns red when", "132:50", "that blood is drawn out whoa the blood", "132:53", "is then deposited onto an index card", "132:56", "it's called dry blood spot testing so a", "132:58", "drop or two of blood on the four corners", "133:01", "the cards then sealed up placed in the", "133:04", "mail and sent to a wada", "133:05", "laboratory this is all have to be done", "133:08", "on video so that no well you have a it's", "133:10", "not the athlete doing themselves you", "133:11", "have a collector doing that I mean that", "133:13", "could be the future where an athlete is", "133:15", "doing it themselves on FaceTime or", "133:17",

collection", "133:48", "officer and a phlebotomist to take out", "133:51", "of the blood to take out the blood I", "133:53", "mean that's that's a couple hundred", "133:54", "dollars they're a vial of blood needs to", "133:57", "be cold shipped to the water", "133:59", "laboratories here you're talking about", "134:01", "dried blood on an index card that just", "134:04", "needs to be sealed up it becomes tamper", "134:05", "proof once it is and put in the mail for", "134:08", "fifty five cents Wow", "134:10", "so I think incredible efficiency", "134:12", "convenience to the athlete for our",

blood the dried", "135:47", "blood spot test would you think she said", "135:50", "awesome didn't feel a thing and she said", "135:52", "my mind is blown by the technical our", "135:55", "technologies come here and that's a big", "135:58", "part of anti-doping and that deterrent", "136:00", "when you're now saying look at how the", "136:01", "technology is evolving here and you get", "136:04", "an athlete that thanks well you know I", "136:06", "think I can out with them or out", "136:08", "cottonmouths then they see shit like", "136:09", "this they're gonna thing and perceptions", "136:12", "almost as important as reality in a lot", "136:14", "of these occasions and they start seeing", "136:16", "things like this and that deterrent", "136:18", "factor is built up I think higher and", "136:19", "higher yeah it seems like at one point", "136:21", "in time there was a race and the dopers", "136:22", "were just like 1/2 step ahead but now it", "136:25", "seems like it's even and with the", "136:28", "possibility of freezing your sample and", "136:31", "then looking towards it to the future", "136:32", "you're it's not it's not worth it yeah I", "136:34", "don't know if I call it even yet but", "136:36", "that gas is definitely narrowing and", "136:38", "you're you're affecting the the way that", "136:41", "dopers are doping these days I think you", "136:43", "know now the the you know micro dosing I", "136:46", "think is big and it's difficult to catch", "136:48", "micro dosing but you've altered the", "136:50", "behavior of the doper from taking you", "136:52", "know drugs really unabated to very small", "136:55", "amounts so the benefits aren't going to", "136:56", "be as great I think you got to consider", "136:58", "that a win for anti-doping I think that", "137:00", "gap continues to narrow and when they", "137:02", "micro dose like what would it like say", "137:04", "would that be like testosterone or", "137:06", "something like that testosterone EPO", "137:07", "probably the two most common", "137:09", "very a window you have of detection", "137:12", "matter of hours hours but you know again", "137:15", "going back to I think I might have told",

p.m.", "137:25", "to 6:00 a.m. they wouldn't test them", "137:28", "during the tour the thought was these", "137:29", "guys are racing up the side of the", "137:31", "mountain for five six hours a day we", "137:33", "gotta let these guys sleep and they", "137:35", "figured out hey if we do something at", "137:36", "10:01 by 601 the release of tester can", "137:39", "come and be clear so you know yeah that", "137:42", "prospects always out there that's why", "137:44", "the UFC program there's no limits on the", "137:46", "test now right it's just a bummer it's", "137:48", "in terms of their sleep side it is yeah", "137:50", "it's brutal but I think you know I think", "137:52", "most appreciate that that's that's the", "137:54", "price of you know a clean sport and try", "137:56", "to ensure would there be a way to change", "137:58", "that like would there be some sort of a", "138:00", "wearable device that would detect", "138:02", "changes in your body I've often thought", "138:03", "that like a wearable device it was to", "138:05", "sleep it collected everything 24 hours a", "138:07", "day that you peel it off after a couple", "138:09", "weeks and it's Innis tested yeah or give", "138:12", "them the wearable device so when they're", "138:15", "sleeping so you don't interrupt their", "138:17", "sleep cycle so 10 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. or", "138:19", "whatever it is that you decide would be", "138:21", "the window that they need to sleep while", "138:23", "they're doing that they must have this", "138:25", "device on that detects any changes to", "138:27", "their
