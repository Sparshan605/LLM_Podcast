lived", "00:20", "up there for like what 95 days 95 days", "00:23", "which actually is kind of a bummer to be", "00:26", "honest with you because you know this if", "00:28", "you saw that video maybe yeah the thing", "00:30", "is if you stay for a hundred days they", "00:32", "give you a patch right I'm a day 95 and", "00:36", "the space shuttle Discovery shows up to", "00:38", "bring me home and

like go around a few", "00:49", "more times or something and yeah it", "00:52", "seems like 95 days should be enough man", "00:55", "give the man a patch right right you", "00:57", "know how much does a patch cost what's", "00:59", "the long as anybody stayed up there the", "01:02", "longest for an American was Scott", "01:04", "Kelly's nearly a year in space is", "01:07", "longest in in a row basically but it is", "01:11", "a Russian that stayed up there for", "01:12", "longer than a year and he has the", "01:14", "all-time record how and they when they", "01:17", "come back like what is 90 days like", "01:19", "coming back because I've talked to", "01:21", "people who've gone there when they come", "01:23", "back their balances all off the", "01:25", "equilibriums oh yeah you're kind of it's", "01:29", "you're kind of messed up and in your", "01:31", "vestibular system is what's affected the", "01:33", "most", "01:33", "at least that's what's most noticeable", "01:35", "when you first get back actually the", "01:37", "first thing I noticed that let me back", "01:39", "up is how heavy things were again you", "01:42", "know so I like I took off my helmet and", "01:44", "I was holding it in my hand and it felt", "01:46", "like I was holding the anchor to the USS", "01:47", "Nimitz you know that's like I can't my", "01:50", "ever gonna brush my teeth it'd be like", "01:51", "too arduous you know this is your body", "01:54", "severely weakened in 95 days well back", "01:58", "in the day back when I was going there", "01:59", "so that mission my long-term mission was", "02:02", "back in 2008 and back then we were still", "02:05", "losing bone density and muscle mass as", "02:08", "we're going up dead along it about he", "02:11", "lost about one percent of bone every", "02:12", "month so I was about three", "02:14", "loh they don't anymore they don't", "02:16", "anymore because we found out we came up", "02:18", "with better countermeasures to prevent", "02:20", "that what are the countermeasures it's", "02:22", "basically working out and it's resistive", "02:25", "exercise that that does it for you", "02:27", "which we knew back when I was going but", "02:29", "the problem was we had a in that we had", "02:31", "this machine that was kind of a first", "02:34", "generation of the workout machine and it", "02:36", "could do large reps but but low load so", "02:40", "you're doing like a lot of reps at low", "02:42", "weight and and that helped but but what", "02:45", "helps it turns out we didn't we found", "02:47", "this out kind of by happenstance but it", "02:49", "turns out that high load low reps works", "02:51", "much better hmm and so we got this new", "02:53", "machine that you could really crank it", "02:55", "up to 11", "02:56", "and the guys now that that are working", "02:58", "out on that thing are coming home with", "02:59", "no muscle muscle or or bone loss at all", "03:02", "wow that's that's right because whoo", "03:04", "what's the Canadian gentleman that we", "03:06", "had on yes Chris Hadfield when commander", "03:09", "Hadfield came back he I believe he said", "03:12", "it took him a whole year to recover yeah", "03:14", "I mean that was still like a nearly it's", "03:17", "still kind of in the early days so he I", "03:18", "don't know which machine he used he", "03:20", "probably did use a new one but overall", "03:23", "it does take to get everything back to", "03:25", "get your full vestibular system back", "03:26", "your sense of balance to get your all", "03:28", "your bone all your muscle back to", "03:30", "baseline it took me a year to get all", "03:32", "that back - Wow", "03:33", "it's kind of like rehabbing from a major", "03:35", "sports injury that's got to be so", "03:38", "strange you know your body just wants to", "03:41", "shrivel up when you're up there because", "03:43", "there's no gravity yeah it's really", "03:45", "interesting because you're it's a it's", "03:47", "an adaptation and then the body's is", "03:49", "incredible so what is doing is it's", "03:51", "realizing hey you know I don't have to", "03:53", "carry my own weight anymore so why do I", "03:56", "need this big bulky skeleton alright", "03:58", "it's like you're becoming kind of like a", "04:00", "fish where you're you're just you're", "04:02", "shedding all the bone density because", "04:05", "you don't have to your body realizes I", "04:07", "don't need it it's like it's like a fish", "04:09", "in water you know the health fish have", "04:10", "very slender bones that's an interesting", "04:13", "way to look at it like a fish yeah Wow", "04:15", "and we fight it by working out and how", "04:18", "often you have to work out every day", "04:20", "every day every day how often how much", "04:22", "time these do schedule two hours now", "04:24", "you're not on the machine for two hours", "04:26", "it's also prepping you", "04:27", "getting changed and you know cleaning up", "04:29", "afterwards but so you're working a good", "04:32", "hour every day was it like a sweat in", "04:34", "space it's weird because what happens is", "04:39", "uh it if you don't notice if you like in", "04:41", "the beginning you don't even realize it", "04:43", "but it's all building up and even", "04:45", "without like if you have no hair to soak", "04:47", "it up it just builds up like this thin", "04:49", "film of water on your head like a", "04:51", "coating of water", "04:52", "aha you don't even notice it cuz it", "04:53", "doesn't run down and then somebody calls", "04:56", "your name you're like yeah and then oh", "05:00", "that's crazy I've never even thought of", "05:02", "that so it just kind of floats off your", "05:04", "body yeah it's like a dog shaking itself", "05:06", "you know and it just goes everywhere so", "05:08", "if you have it on your arm you can kind", "05:09", "of just go and the sweat will go flying", "05:12", "you know your crewmates won't be too", "05:13", "happy with you if you do this a lot but", "05:15", "yeah Wow oh that's is there video of", "05:18", "people doing that in space there's got", "05:20", "to be there should we show so much video", "05:22", "somebody's gonna have done that but so", "05:25", "are you basically doing compound", "05:26", "movements like deadlifts and squats and", "05:28", "things along those lines", "05:29", "yeah functional fitness kind of stuff", "05:30", "we're but and you're focusing on certain", "05:33", "areas so the bone loss comes mostly from", "05:35", "your legs because you're not loading so", "05:38", "so basically our bones need a stimulus", "05:42", "to regenerate and it happens to us every", "05:44", "day so as you walk as you go up stairs", "05:47", "that load that the bones feel the", "05:49", "compressive load is telling the bone hey", "05:51", "make some more hmm now you take that", "05:53", "away and the bone stops making more and", "05:55", "that's the problem people say like can't", "05:57", "you just think like calcium pills but", "05:59", "it's not a mineral deficiency it's just", "06:02", "there's no load that's interesting the", "06:04", "the body adapts so quickly", "06:06", "yeah the ninety days it has such a and", "06:09", "if you didn't do anything for ninety", "06:10", "days at all you'd be in real trouble", "06:11", "right", "06:12", "yeah that's what's really kind of freaky", "06:14", "is thinking about like well what if we", "06:16", "don't fight this because all these", "06:18", "adaptations you go through are not a", "06:20", "problem when you're in space it's only a", "06:22", "problem if you want to come home right", "06:24", "right losing that bone even like not", "06:28", "using your vestibular organs anymore", "06:30", "your semicircular canals your otolith", "06:31", "organs", "06:32", "you're not making use of those for your", "06:34", "balance you're just going purely on the", "06:36", "visual but that doesn Ischl even make", "06:38", "you kind of sick you get kind of it's", "06:40", "like being airsick", "06:41", "seasick but once your body adapts you're", "06:43", "fine so the question is like what would", "06:46", "we become if we didn't fight it what if", "06:48", "we just went with it and stayed up there", "06:51", "building a water balloon what would you", "06:54", "become right you'd become actually the", "06:56", "place I think in science fiction that", "06:58", "gets it the most correct is if you watch", "07:00", "the the expanse ever watch that show no", "07:03", "I heard it's a really good show I never", "07:04", "got into it though it's good and they", "07:06", "get it right because they show people", "07:07", "like these belters that live in partial", "07:09", "gravity like their whole lives and they", "07:11", "have much slip more slender bones and", "07:14", "like they catch this like terrorist guy", "07:15", "and they want to torture him and all", "07:18", "they do is I make him stand up in", "07:19", "gravity and unearth and it's incredibly", "07:22", "painful for him and uh oh wow yeah that", "07:24", "would probably be what would happen and", "07:27", "it must take a long-ass time to get", "07:29", "everything back if you went from earth", "07:32", "gravity to the space station and you", "07:34", "lived up there for a year and didn't do", "07:36", "anything about it and then came back to", "07:37", "earth you'd basically be like it would", "07:39", "be hard to crawl right yeah you would", "07:42", "yet you're you all you're if you don't", "07:45", "try to fight it the vestibular stuff", "07:48", "would come back probably about the same", "07:51", "rate but well you would be really", "07:52", "hurting with your muscle atrophy and", "07:53", "your bone so you wouldn't you would lose", "07:55", "a lot of your skeleton if you're up", "07:57", "there for a year and did nothing and you", "07:59", "would also you're all your muscles that", "08:01", "you don't use like in your legs and your", "08:03", "postural muscles so you lower back", "08:05", "you're not using those anymore so they", "08:08", "were just like waste away to nothing", "08:09", "you'd be okay in your arms because", "08:11", "you're doing everything you're", "08:11", "everything you do is with your arms", "08:13", "that's how you move that's how you get", "08:14", "around is by pulling and pushing but you", "08:17", "don't you know there's no walk in", "08:19", "there's no stairs", "08:20", "there's nothing does it affect the way", "08:22", "you think at all you know some people", "08:26", "describe a kind of an issue with", "08:28", "short-term memory they call it like", "08:29", "space brain is that a small group of", "08:33", "people that would understand what you're", "08:34", "talking about there I got spray spray", "08:36", "bro I got that too oh yeah so it's", "08:42", "something that I never really noticed it", "08:45", "but I don't know how much of that is", "08:48", "real and how much it's like like you're", "08:49", "freaking out because you're in space", "08:51", "right so it's distracting and maybe you", "08:53", "forget like what then", "08:54", "was you're supposed to remember but mmm", "08:56", "you know like if you're really in the", "08:58", "middle of something and you're all", "09:00", "excited and or and and and you kind of", "09:03", "can't remember somebody's phone number", "09:04", "it's kind of like kind of like that oh", "09:06", "okay so it's just well I would imagine", "09:08", "that just being up there breathing that", "09:11", "recirculated air it's gotta be odd right", "09:13", "yeah and it might stink but I don't know", "09:16", "because the other thing that happens is", "09:19", "you have this big fluid shift so right", "09:22", "now we have a lot of blood pooling up in", "09:24", "our legs and our heart it's most", "09:28", "important job of course is to feed the", "09:29", "bringing oxygenated blood and then when", "09:32", "you take the gravity vector out of the", "09:34", "picture the heart sends too much up to", "09:37", "the brain", "09:37", "and the stuff doesn't collect in our", "09:39", "legs anymore and it all shoots up here", "09:41", "and you get to shift of all that blood", "09:42", "volume to your upper body and your head", "09:45", "gets all puffed up whoa yeah like my so", "09:48", "my first night in space I went to sleep", "09:50", "which is kind of hard to do cuz you're", "09:52", "in space you don't want to go to sleep", "09:54", "right yeah and on that first night I", "09:59", "woke up in the middle of the night I", "10:01", "could have sworn I was standing on my", "10:03", "head doing a headstand or a handstand", "10:05", "I'm like why am i standing on my head in", "10:08", "my sleep this is strange", "10:10", "right and then I looked at the one that", "10:12", "saw the earth I'm like oh that's right", "10:13", "I'm in space yeah so all the blood was", "10:16", "just kind of pooling in your head yeah", "10:18", "is if you like hanging by gravity boots", "10:20", "or something it feels exactly like that", "10:22", "Wow and then after a day - you get used", "10:25", "to it and it doesn't bother you anymore", "10:26", "but you feel congested because you still", "10:29", "have all those volume up here so your", "10:31", "sense of smell and your sense of taste", "10:33", "are all dead end Wow Wow", "10:35", "it's kind of like yeah so it's kind of", "10:37", "like when you have a cold and you in in", "10:40", "your sense of smell and your sense of", "10:41", "taste our leg not as strong so it's like", "10:44", "that all the time that's why we take we", "10:46", "cover we have every hot sauce known to", "10:48", "humankind upon the space station we like", "10:51", "sriracha we got you know Louisiana Cajun", "10:54", "fire sauce and all whatever we got like", "10:57", "a whole stockpile of it because you pour", "11:00", "that on everything so you get some taste", "11:02", "because otherwise everything tastes", "11:03", "really bland oh wow now what are you", "11:06", "eating up there", "11:07", "that's terrible is it freeze-dried foods", "11:11", "mostly er but yeah you don't go for the", "11:14", "food alright this is not like a foodie", "11:15", "holiday so you get basically two choices", "11:21", "you have the American food which is", "11:23", "essentially MREs like military", "11:25", "freeze-dried irradiated you know", "11:28", "infinite shelf life kind of stuff and", "11:31", "and then the Russian food is also based", "11:34", "on their military rations but from", "11:35", "submarines and the Russian food actually", "11:38", "tastes better but the problem is one a", "11:41", "presentation because it comes in cans so", "11:45", "you get these these cans and even though", "11:48", "it tastes good you open that can up and", "11:49", "you look at it it's like God looks like", "11:51", "dog food there's like congealed and yeah", "11:55", "but it tastes it tastes better but it's", "12:00", "just like so unappetizing when you open", "12:01", "that can happen you know it's just not", "12:05", "it does what would happen if you brought", "12:08", "fresh things up there would they would", "12:10", "they rot at the same rate that they", "12:12", "would rot in America yeah the thing is", "12:15", "we have no refrigeration oh we didn't", "12:18", "when I was there they actually have a", "12:19", "small refrigerator now so you can't have", "12:21", "anything that needs to be refrigerated", "12:23", "but you would usually like for the first", "12:26", "couple days we take a bag of fresh food", "12:27", "and we took like sandwiches and and and", "12:31", "fruits and vegetables and stuff and then", "12:33", "because that's the last time you're", "12:34", "gonna have it after that's all gonna be", "12:36", "this the stuff in the packets that you", "12:37", "add water to now when the first day you", "12:41", "actually got up there was that the first", "12:43", "time you had ever been in space on my", "12:46", "first mission yeah the first yeah the", "12:48", "first time in space so your first view", "12:50", "of the Earth from above yeah was that", "12:52", "right there what is that like Wow", "12:54", "well I didn't see it right away because", "12:57", "I was in the mid-deck the downstairs of", "12:59", "the shuttle and there's only one window", "13:00", "down there and it's in the corner okay", "13:03", "so it's in the hatch and it's like the", "13:05", "size of a dinner plate and I was up", "13:09", "there you got a lot of work to do when", "13:10", "you as soon as you get up there so I'm", "13:12", "working like crazy and after about 30", "13:13", "minutes I see this pale blue glow coming", "13:17", "from that window and I'm like", "13:19", "that's the earth you know I should have", "13:22", "a look at that and I was super excited", "13:24", "for this you know so I wanted to be", "13:27", "ready so I pause I close my eyes I", "13:28", "meditated you know call it whatever you", "13:30", "want", "13:31", "I just got ready and when I felt like I", "13:35", "was ready I floated up to that window", "13:37", "and I opened up my eyes and I gazed out", "13:41", "for the very first time at the earth", "13:43", "from space and what that felt like is is", "13:48", "really really hard to describe in words", "13:51", "but if I had to pick one word to", "13:54", "describe what it was feeling at that", "13:55", "moment it would be me really just man", "14:02", "just man I mean it was alright it was", "14:04", "pretty it had a lot like those earth", "14:06", "colors like blues and greens right but", "14:09", "man we've all seen pictures of the Earth", "14:11", "from space okay I mean we got like HD", "14:15", "video coming down from space now where", "14:17", "it's just spectacular you could see", "14:19", "stuff in that video that you can't even", "14:20", "see with your own eyes like like the", "14:23", "aurora and all that hmm and I'm sure", "14:26", "like John Glenn and and like Yuri", "14:28", "Gagarin had no idea what to expect and", "14:30", "so when they looked at and I saw the", "14:31", "earth they freaked out you know and it", "14:33", "was amazing and it was beautiful but it", "14:36", "was it was underwhelming I guess my", "14:38", "expectations are so high mmm like I felt", "14:41", "like there should be like some heavenly", "14:42", "choir and that we should all hold hands", "14:44", "I think yeah yeah most people that have", "14:48", "done it they talk about this realization", "14:50", "that you like this inescapable", "14:52", "realization that we're all on this thing", "14:55", "together and that all these boundaries", "14:58", "of civilizations and cultures and", "15:01", "countries and continents are all", "15:03", "nonsense we're really just all on this", "15:05", "one thing together yeah they call that", "15:07", "the overview effect mmm and a lot of", "15:09", "guys come back and talk about that and", "15:11", "they really feel it and they talk about", "15:12", "a world without borders and you know and", "15:15", "it's a beautiful sentiment and and I", "15:17", "don't I don't want to knock that in any", "15:19", "way but cuz like really a whirlwind up", "15:25", "what you expect to see expect they look", "15:26", "damaged and I dotted lines between a", "15:29", "really", "15:31", "you know I guess it you do you it's", "15:35", "inescapable when you look down and you", "15:36", "see the planet and you realize that", "15:38", "we're all in the same boat you know but", "15:42", "that didn't strike me as a sudden", "15:45", "realization because I think it's because", "15:47", "I knew that before I went you shouldn't", "15:49", "have to go and strap into a rocket and", "15:52", "blast off and look at the earth another", "15:54", "basically we're all human beings I think", "15:55", "I mean I think the things that unite us", "15:58", "are so much stronger and more important", "16:01", "than the crazy little things that divide", "16:03", "us like race or sex or nationality or", "16:06", "politics or whatever and and you at the", "16:11", "end of the day we have this one home and", "16:12", "and we're all stuck here in it together", "16:15", "so I had that strong knowledge before I", "16:20", "went and maybe that's why when I look", "16:22", "down I'm like yeah there it is okay I", "16:24", "get it mmm but it wasn't like all of a", "16:26", "sudden like that the the shade was", "16:29", "pulled back then there's like suddenly a", "16:31", "new realization about like well is there", "16:34", "one place that's the spot on the space", "16:37", "station to get the view well you really", "16:39", "got a big window there's this huge", "16:41", "window called the cupola that wasn't", "16:44", "there in my first mission but it was", "16:45", "there my second mission I got to see it", "16:47", "the second time they added a window yeah", "16:52", "a window the space station yeah you just", "16:57", "you know get there you know it's a it", "17:00", "made it a whole module no had this", "17:03", "cupola which is like as that it right", "17:05", "there so what you look into that's", "17:07", "exactly it yeah so this that's pretty", "17:10", "tight", "17:11", "it's like a it's a dome and so you get a", "17:14", "full 360 view and it's spectacular Wow", "17:17", "and we tell the guys that don't get to", "17:19", "do a spacewalk that this view is just as", "17:22", "good as doing a spacewalk but it's not", "17:25", "it's not it's not but don't tell them", "17:28", "because it it makes them feel better", "17:29", "they're gonna listen yeah", "17:31", "what is the spacewalk like man well", "17:34", "first thing I tell you that the", "17:36", "likelihood of me doing the spacewalk was", "17:38", "like slim to none when I first got there", "17:42", "they tell you that when you", "17:44", "to become an astronaut to go talk to", "17:46", "some of the other astronauts and so I", "17:48", "went in there and we had this", "17:50", "presentation about space walking and it", "17:52", "seemed like to be the like the ultimate", "17:53", "experience just an incredible thing and", "17:55", "I wanted to do it bad so I went I'm", "17:59", "talking to this one astronaut who's a", "18:01", "pretty tall guy those who they can't", "18:04", "tell from the podcast I'm five four okay", "18:06", "so I'm not like not like a real towering", "18:09", "individual a little vertically", "18:11", "challenged I guess and I'm talking to", "18:13", "this real tall astronaut and I said you", "18:15", "know I just heard about this space", "18:17", "walking sounds awesome I want I've been", "18:20", "living in California I've been doing", "18:21", "like some rock climbing some scuba", "18:23", "diving maybe that makes me a good", "18:24", "candidate to do a spacewalk and this", "18:27", "tall astronaut looked at me", "18:28", "like right in the eye he laughed in my", "18:32", "face he said what are you four foot what", "18:38", "a rude I know my first thought was you", "18:43", "know I thought astronauts were supposed", "18:45", "to be polite and this guy like was not", "18:48", "being nice but he was he was actually", "18:51", "just being brutally honest you know it's", "18:52", "kind of tough love and he was like", "18:53", "listen the suit is one size fits all", "18:56", "you're gonna get in that thing and it's", "18:59", "gonna swallow you up and you're not", "19:00", "gonna be able to anything you're gonna", "19:01", "be useless so this is impossible forget", "19:04", "about it so I was kind of pissed off but", "19:07", "but I wasn't gonna let this guy stop me", "19:08", "right so I get there I got the job and I", "19:13", "go down for my first training exercise", "19:14", "which was in this huge pool we got in", "19:17", "Houston and it's like it's a hundred", "19:20", "feet wide 200 feet long 40 feet deep and", "19:23", "we can fit like most of the space", "19:25", "station in there and they get a crane", "19:27", "that comes by they put you in the suit", "19:28", "which weighs you know something like 175", "19:31", "pounds and stuff with the and then in", "19:34", "addition you you're in it too it picks", "19:37", "you up and they plop you in the water", "19:38", "and you float around it's kind of like", "19:40", "being up in space and that's how we", "19:41", "train so get down there's my very first", "19:44", "exercise and I could tell in the first", "19:47", "five minutes of this training exercise", "19:49", "that big tall astronaut that laughed in", "19:51", "my face was right I was not I was", "19:58", "how is that was not doing well I was I", "20:00", "was screwing up I was like it just", "20:02", "wasn't going well why do they make a", "20:04", "one-size-fits-all suit it seems they", "20:07", "have the ability to alter the arms and", "20:10", "the legs a little bit and they have it's", "20:13", "actually three different sized upper", "20:15", "torsos there's a there's a medium a", "20:17", "large and an extra large but that said", "20:19", "it's limited and because it costs a lot", "20:21", "of money to make different sizes so", "20:23", "there's only the gloves that can tailor", "20:25", "because that's actually the most", "20:26", "important thing but I'm I'm getting my", "20:29", "butt kicked you know and I and I got a", "20:31", "needs improvement which is a NASA nice", "20:34", "way of saying you failed right but I", "20:37", "wasn't ready to give up I went and I", "20:40", "knew I was going to need help so I", "20:42", "talked to the people to make this suit", "20:45", "and they did some of those things they", "20:47", "like they shortened up the arms they", "20:48", "fixed it up a little bit for me and then", "20:50", "I talked to the trainers and we said", "20:52", "okay yeah we got to think outside the", "20:53", "box here if we give you the standard", "20:55", "procedure you're gonna be at a", "20:57", "disadvantage but maybe we change your", "20:59", "body positions instead of going straight", "21:01", "on to the worksite maybe we come at the", "21:02", "worksite from the side so you get more", "21:04", "reached that way and we start working at", "21:06", "it and we got better and better and the", "21:09", "end of the story is that I got to", "21:11", "eventually I got the highest possible", "21:13", "qualification to do the most complicated", "21:15", "spacewalks we do and I ended up doing", "21:18", "three different spacewalks so of course", "21:20", "my career and that big tall guy they", "21:24", "laughed in my face you didn't get to do", "21:26", "any yeah you get for talking shit sir", "21:29", "look at you out there yeah that's me", "21:33", "now what is that feeling like because", "21:35", "it's got to feel insane when you're", "21:38", "strapped to a space station that's", "21:41", "floating around and you're just hanging", "21:43", "by a cord yeah well you're holding on", "21:46", "tight okay and it you do have that", "21:49", "safety tether that you see there and and", "21:51", "you know they can prepare you for", "21:53", "everything except for the visual so when", "21:56", "you like are in the pool you're staring", "21:58", "at the pool wall when you get up there", "22:00", "and you see the whole earth below yeah", "22:01", "some people go out there and get like a", "22:04", "sense of fear of falling of course you", "22:08", "if you let go you're not going anywhere", "22:10", "the space station is moving 17,500 miles", "22:13", "an hour but so are you", "22:14", "so it's kind of like doing the wing wing", "22:17", "walking on an airplane but with no air", "22:18", "to blow you off the wing so when you", "22:22", "look at the space station is rock solid", "22:24", "but you look down and some people get", "22:26", "the fear of falling and then they hold", "22:28", "on real tight which is a terrible", "22:29", "terrible mistake because we call it", "22:32", "space walking but you're not walking", "22:34", "you're doing everything with your arms", "22:35", "so you can wear your arms out exactly so", "22:38", "now if you're climbing and you get like", "22:40", "kind of totally thrashed in your", "22:42", "forearms and now you get that claw hand", "22:44", "and it's useless yeah you can do that", "22:46", "and you got like seven and a half hours", "22:48", "that go and that's bad so so you're out", "22:51", "there for seven and a half hours yeah", "22:54", "with your tepee diaper diaper yeah", "22:59", "poop as well try to avoid that do your", "23:03", "best", "23:03", "I as a as a scientist I had to", "23:07", "experiment right of course so during a", "23:10", "training exercise I waited to like the", "23:11", "very end just in case you know and I let", "23:14", "one go right before they pulled me out", "23:16", "of the pool one day and I resolved never", "23:19", "ever to do that again is that number one", "23:22", "or number two year or two oh boy number", "23:24", "one there's no big deal yeah save that", "23:27", "project oh I could have told you what", "23:29", "was gonna happen", "23:29", "that's disgusting and you're doing in", "23:31", "the pool - you're not doing it an actual", "23:33", "space space yeah to be one of the rare", "23:35", "people that it's actually pooped in", "23:37", "space would be very interesting that's", "23:40", "it that's you know we keep all these", "23:41", "records I don't know who's got that", "23:43", "record it's not me I / yeah", "23:46", "so you just have to let it go when", "23:48", "you're up there yeah so what it what are", "23:50", "you doing when you're out there so if", "23:51", "you're doing seven and a half hours", "23:53", "worth of work you're basically doing", "23:55", "maintenance so it's kind of like being a", "23:57", "mechanic or a technician the way I", "23:59", "describe it but the suit is like so hard", "24:02", "it restricts everything you do because", "24:04", "it's blown up to about four pounds per", "24:06", "square inch and so even just closing", "24:10", "your fists takes work because the the", "24:13", "suits like a balloon and wants to stay", "24:14", "like this and so just closing your", "24:16", "fingers is is takes effort and over", "24:19", "seven and a half hours that gets really", "24:20", "fatiguing you're moving your arms", "24:22", "everything is and", "24:23", "the suit can only move like you can't do", "24:25", "this right you can do this maybe so your", "24:28", "your your ability to raise up your", "24:30", "shoulders is really limited so you're", "24:32", "trying to do all this work but you're", "24:33", "working inside this suit and I describe", "24:36", "it as like it's like trying to change", "24:37", "the oil in your car while wearing a", "24:39", "medieval suit of armor it's hard what", "24:43", "what kind of maintenance are you doing", "24:45", "on the outside of the spaceship", "24:47", "you know we're cleaning the windows", "24:48", "getting the bugs off and like no oh yeah", "24:53", "that that's another and this particular", "24:55", "spacewalk we're assembling a robot that", "24:58", "we took up there but we did other things", "24:59", "like we put a new antenna on top of the", "25:02", "space station we swapped out a bunch of", "25:05", "batteries that were getting old", "25:07", "did you know stuff like that that's", "25:09", "fascinating so you have to you have to", "25:11", "have some real understanding of", "25:13", "mechanical things as well yeah I mean", "25:16", "you're putting stuff together yeah", "25:18", "exactly I mean you it really helps to", "25:20", "have some kind of mechanical aptitude I", "25:22", "mean a lot of us like working on our", "25:24", "cars or building things in our garage", "25:25", "hobbyist kind of stuff we actually", "25:28", "started right out as I was leaving NASA", "25:30", "which was back in 2010 we saw up like", "25:33", "kind of an informal program where we're", "25:35", "we were like going over each other's", "25:36", "garages and doing car repair stuff just", "25:39", "to get more hands-on experience with", "25:42", "that kind of thing so when like say if", "25:44", "you have to do an antenna up there is", "25:46", "that something you're trained for on", "25:47", "earth in the pool and then you go up", "25:50", "there and do it during the shuttle days", "25:52", "absolutely everything we did was", "25:54", "choreographed down to like exactly where", "25:56", "I'm going to put what what handrail I'm", "25:58", "going to put my toolbox on I mean", "25:59", "everything is all figured out in advance", "26:01", "but nowadays and sometimes on space", "26:03", "station even when I was there when", "26:05", "things break you don't have the luxury", "26:07", "of training that for if we're gonna do a", "26:09", "shuttle mission we're doing a really", "26:10", "complex spacewalk we'll do everything", "26:13", "we're gonna do in space at least 10", "26:15", "times in the pool first but these days", "26:18", "you don't have that luxury if something", "26:19", "breaks and you you brief a brief it you", "26:21", "talk about it you you you have some", "26:24", "powerpoints and then you're out the door", "26:25", "and you got to go do it so how much", "26:27", "briefing and how many powerpoints the", "26:29", "training that goes on prior to one of", "26:31", "these unscheduled DBAs is you know", "26:33", "typically on the order of like a day's", "26:35", "worth of", "26:36", "all told so are these powerpoints", "26:38", "pre-loaded onto the space station and", "26:41", "you get it or they have to beam it up to", "26:42", "you", "26:42", "it depends on exactly what your what", "26:44", "you're doing so we identify like the", "26:46", "most likely and most serious things that", "26:48", "could go wrong and we practice those in", "26:50", "the pool and we have all those", "26:51", "procedures suitcase before we ever go", "26:53", "but then sometimes you get a surprise", "26:55", "you know sometimes something breaks you", "26:57", "weren't expecting the break or breaks in", "26:58", "a certain way or there's a complication", "27:00", "that you weren't planning on and then", "27:02", "you gotta improvise", "27:02", "wow that's got to be crazy because I", "27:05", "mean and you're probably doing things", "27:08", "that other people on the space station", "27:09", "maybe haven't done so there's no one", "27:12", "that can tell you hey I did it's no big", "27:14", "deal yeah but you know even if you're", "27:16", "doing something that you rehearsed 10", "27:17", "times and you think you got it all", "27:19", "figured out you still get surprised when", "27:20", "they actually get up there the big one", "27:23", "that I remember is on my second", "27:25", "spacewalk we're connecting this dish", "27:27", "antenna and had to go on top of this big", "27:29", "boom like a big pedestal and there was a", "27:32", "connector that had an electrical", "27:34", "connector and we had like an hour or so", "27:36", "to connect the thing and without it", "27:39", "connected it wasn't getting any power or", "27:41", "data to that antenna and it could get", "27:43", "too cold", "27:44", "and this gazillion-dollar antenna could", "27:47", "be a worthless hunk of junk if you take", "27:49", "too long you're on the clock because", "27:51", "when it was in the shuttle it was", "27:52", "plugged in it was getting its heaters", "27:53", "were on and now you got to plug it back", "27:55", "in and get the heaters back on in a", "27:57", "certain amount of time and so ok we", "28:00", "planned this we train this we get up", "28:02", "there and the clinic there's won't go", "28:03", "together like it doesn't fit and these", "28:06", "two pieces of equipment sat next to each", "28:08", "other for like a year in Florida you", "28:11", "know like a warehouse and nobody thought", "28:12", "well oh maybe we should make sure this", "28:14", "thing Oh No yeah and we got that like it", "28:17", "doesn't fit and we're like crap you know", "28:20", "what do we do so we're shoving and we're", "28:23", "shoving so hard we're pushing understand", "28:25", "so hard that the guys inside the space", "28:27", "station said they feel the space station", "28:29", "shaken like that's how hard we're trying", "28:31", "and then we see little metal shavings", "28:32", "come off and one of those they can get", "28:34", "into connectors were like that's bad so", "28:37", "we stopped and and then and then this", "28:41", "was like kind of my my big hero moment", "28:43", "you know I can a movies they like Brad", "28:46", "Pitt saves the solar system and stuff", "28:48", "you know this is my thing all right", "28:50", "it's not that exciting but I thought I", "28:53", "had this idea said hey the problem we", "28:57", "were basically having was that the", "28:58", "female side was too small and now so I", "29:01", "was too big for it to fit together so I", "29:03", "said to the one of my crewmates inside I", "29:06", "said hey how long til the Sun comes up", "29:08", "because you know it takes 90 minutes to", "29:10", "go around the earth and every 45 minutes", "29:13", "the Sun is either coming up or going", "29:14", "down so it can't be that long and he", "29:17", "goes actually about 10 minutes because", "29:19", "we're behind the earth and it was dark", "29:20", "and then in 10 minutes the Sun was going", "29:22", "to come up and make perfect so I took", "29:24", "the the the female side arms I'm sorry I", "29:29", "took that I took the male side and I", "29:31", "held it in my glove okay and I put it", "29:34", "behind the structure wait I knew the Sun", "29:36", "was going to be coming from here so I", "29:37", "put it in the shadow and I waited for", "29:39", "the Sun to come up and it hit the female", "29:41", "side and the temperature difference if", "29:45", "you're in the Sun or in the shade is I", "29:46", "can be up to like 600 degrees Fahrenheit", "29:48", "difference so I let the Sun hit it and", "29:51", "warm it up and I took the male side", "29:53", "quickly out of my my insulated hand and", "29:55", "away from the shadow and I slid it in", "29:58", "and went right in Wow and that was it", "30:00", "save day so you just deduced this just", "30:03", "understanding how things change", "30:05", "according to temperature yeah thermal", "30:07", "expansion Wow", "30:09", "yeah yeah that's my thing did you yell", "30:13", "to people manufactured it no we're so", "30:16", "happy we have video this you can and", "30:19", "we're we're going woohoo give each other", "30:21", "high fives in the suits we were doing", "30:22", "like it was a victory that's a great", "30:28", "victory though there really is that you", "30:29", "figured that out yeah a lot of people", "30:31", "would have been stuck up there how the", "30:32", "fuck didn't no one try it before they", "30:34", "went up there I don't know maybe they", "30:37", "did and it's just like maybe they", "30:39", "weren't when it got up the space and", "30:40", "experiences different temperatures it", "30:43", "expanded differently I don't know for", "30:45", "sure but so I'm not pointing any fingers", "30:47", "but it didn't work and but we solved it", "30:50", "and that's that's the kind of thing that", "30:51", "you can't like until you have AI or", "30:54", "something that can really learn you", "30:55", "can't code that so that's a real benefit", "30:58", "that humans bring to the equation being", "31:01", "able to do to be able to adapt to", "31:03", "something you didn't", "31:04", "otherwise that thing would have been", "31:05", "junk yeah for robots doing it you're", "31:07", "stuck it's gonna keep pushing it's not", "31:09", "gonna you know you're not gonna be able", "31:11", "to program it now that feeling that you", "31:13", "were talking about of looking out the", "31:15", "window where it was kind of math and", "31:16", "then the difference between that and the", "31:18", "spacewalk is that where you get this", "31:20", "real sense of being in space above the", "31:25", "earth the spacewalk you can't yeah it", "31:27", "that's breathtaking because you have", "31:30", "this helmet that's like a giant fishbowl", "31:32", "and you know after a while you kind of", "31:33", "forget that it's there and you're just", "31:35", "like it's like you know the old Superman", "31:37", "with Christopher Reeve when he's like", "31:38", "flying around the earth and he's just", "31:40", "like in his underwear or whatever yeah", "31:42", "it's like that because you forget like", "31:45", "if you ever have gotten scuba diving and", "31:47", "you get to the point where you just kind", "31:49", "of forget you have the mask on I've", "31:50", "never scuba dive I've only snorkelled if", "31:53", "you spend a lot of time down there you", "31:55", "can get to the point where you kind of", "31:56", "like forget that you're that you're in", "31:58", "it this alien environment and it becomes", "31:59", "like you become one with it mm-hmm and", "32:02", "that's just a wonderful thing well", "32:04", "you've done underwater exploration as", "32:07", "well mm-hmm yeah what have you done", "32:09", "there I live for two weeks", "32:11", "in the bottom of the sea Wow Jesus just", "32:18", "you saying that two weeks at the bottom", "32:21", "of the ocean yeah how deep it was", "32:24", "exactly twenty thousand millimeters", "32:26", "under the sea is about 60 feet which", "32:28", "works out to be about no only 60 feet", "32:31", "that's yeah that doesn't freak me out", "32:33", "too much I thought you're gonna select", "32:34", "miles no I'd start panicking no it's", "32:36", "about 60 feet but but the cool thing was", "32:39", "we stayed there for weeks Wow now if", "32:42", "you're normal if you're normally scuba", "32:43", "diving and you go down 60 feet you have", "32:46", "60 minutes and then you got to come back", "32:48", "up or you get too much nitrogen in your", "32:50", "blood and you're gonna get bent right", "32:52", "mm-hmm so so we if you but it's not a", "32:57", "problem if you just stay the problem is", "32:59", "then if you stay you build up all that", "33:01", "nitrogen in your blood now you can't go", "33:03", "back up so like if you run out of air or", "33:06", "you lose sight of your buddy or", "33:08", "something you can't go to the surface", "33:09", "because within a couple hours you'll be", "33:10", "dead Wow so you have to stay down there", "33:13", "and we use cave diving techniques that", "33:17", "we did a lot of training for", "33:18", "to be safe and we have redundant tanks", "33:20", "redundant manifolds redundant regulators", "33:23", "and we could head valves that we can", "33:25", "flip around so we can always make sure", "33:27", "we can get air without ever having that", "33:29", "in an emergency ever having to come up", "33:30", "because coming up it's not an option so", "33:33", "how do you eventually get out", "33:36", "it's a freaky thing it takes a better", "33:38", "day and what you do is you take so we're", "33:41", "living in this habitat and it was kind", "33:42", "of like a submarine on the bottom of the", "33:45", "ocean but it didn't have a motor so just", "33:47", "like stuck on the floor like a big like", "33:50", "a big cylinder and it had a hole cut in", "33:52", "the side here and and the only thing was", "33:56", "keeping the ocean out was the air", "33:57", "pressure inside whoa", "33:59", "kind of like taking a cup and flipping", "34:01", "it over putting it in a bathtub and", "34:03", "trapping the air and you just scuba dive", "34:06", "on down and then you swim into that", "34:08", "thing and then if then once you pop up", "34:09", "in that hole it's like you're in a", "34:11", "swimming pool inside the habitat and", "34:14", "then you just step out into the habitat", "34:16", "whoa have you ever seen the movie the", "34:19", "abyss yes it's like this like that oh", "34:21", "yeah", "34:22", "how accurate is that movie I think", "34:26", "what's a guy was a Navy SEAL in there he", "34:28", "just like like that's crazy from the", "34:29", "geese legs like what they call that deep", "34:32", "dementia or something is that fake yeah", "34:34", "that's big so this process of getting", "34:40", "back to surface level how you said it", "34:44", "takes a day what do you have to do so he", "34:46", "do is you close up that hole and you", "34:47", "convert the habitat into a pressure", "34:49", "chamber and what you do is we very very", "34:51", "slowly bring the pressure back to sea", "34:54", "level so you decrease the pressure and", "34:56", "you slowly as if you're slowly slowly", "34:58", "going up in the water column and then", "35:02", "over as you do it gradually that the", "35:03", "nitrogen slowly comes out of your blood", "35:05", "and you could feel it kind of tingles", "35:07", "Wow over the course of a day just lie", "35:09", "you tried to lie still in your bunk and", "35:11", "just like read a book or something in", "35:13", "there but you feel like this tingling", "35:14", "and then after about a day of that they", "35:17", "get you all the way back to sea level", "35:18", "slowly so that the nitrogen what you", "35:21", "know it is it's like if you take a can", "35:22", "of soda and you shake it up if you open", "35:25", "it and you know um the top quickly right", "35:27", "but if you open the top really slowly", "35:29", "and he let it slowly come out", "35:32", "don't get all the bubbles right it's", "35:34", "that same effect ah that's a that's a", "35:36", "great analogy yeah oh what's freakier", "35:40", "being in the bottom of the ocean or", "35:42", "being up in space up in space is more", "35:45", "surreal", "35:46", "yeah because the de floating the earth", "35:49", "out the window the views are better but", "35:51", "being it down there was pretty well too", "35:53", "I remember once we're doing this", "35:55", "experiment where I had my crew mate and", "35:58", "had an ultrasound and we're doing this", "36:00", "telemedicine experiment so there were", "36:01", "these docks in Houston looking at the", "36:03", "screen but there was a delay and I was", "36:05", "supposed to find her kidney and I'm like", "36:07", "searching around for a kidney and then I", "36:10", "look up and I look out the window and I", "36:12", "see a six-foot hammerhead shark right", "36:14", "out the window and we have a guy in the", "36:16", "water and I was I and I dropped a giant", "36:19", "f-bomb like wow you know and and all the", "36:23", "all the docs in Houston are freaking out", "36:24", "too thinking like in a moment thing to", "36:26", "see her liver explode on the screen or", "36:28", "something and like what's that what has", "36:29", "a patient has a patient like patients", "36:31", "fine got a six-foot hammerhead", "36:35", "yeah that's got to be really weird right", "36:37", "you're you're in that thing in their", "36:39", "world for how long two weeks yeah so is", "36:46", "that the weirdest animal that you saw is", "36:47", "the hammerhead the scariest thing I saw", "36:51", "was one that I was taking a dump", "36:55", "true story I the way you do this okay", "37:00", "number one you just pee in the pool okay", "37:01", "but if you have to go number two you go", "37:05", "into the pool cuz yous gonna you don't", "37:07", "want to floater in your pool right", "37:08", "that's of course like Caddyshack you", "37:10", "know what that right so what you do is", "37:13", "you go you don't take a tank you just", "37:15", "take your mask and your fins you go down", "37:18", "naked you can we had a we had a mixed", "37:21", "gender crew so I wore some trunks but", "37:23", "you know and you just go down and you", "37:27", "have to swim I don't know it's like", "37:29", "maybe 10 15 feet it's not that far and", "37:31", "there's what we call the gazebo which is", "37:33", "just a little dome that has air inside", "37:37", "now you're out in the middle of the", "37:39", "Atlantic Ocean like with no tank no in", "37:42", "you're 60 feet down it's night you can't", "37:44", "see a thing", "37:45", "alone in the ocean but you can see this", "37:47", "little gazebo you swim to that you pop", "37:49", "in and then you got air into some valves", "37:52", "you let in some fresh air and then you", "37:54", "hold on and you just and you take off", "37:56", "your trunks

down", "38:35", "no scuba tank at night at night Oh with", "38:38", "the sound of the ocean like like lapping", "38:42", "against the dome and you're looking down", "38:45", "and this endless black you know just a", "38:48", "black void and you're thinking about", "38:50", "every single scary ocean movie like jaws", "38:54", "you know the meg or whatever they abyss", "38:58", "all those scary movies right and you", "39:00", "think about all those things that could", "39:02", "be down there it can't help but going", "39:04", "through your head so it's kind of freaky", "39:06", "and then you

"42:51", "regular scuba tanks and what is the", "42:54", "capacity these tanks like how long can", "42:56", "you stay down just swimming around for", "42:58", "we have two and we can isolate them in", "43:00", "case one of them springs a leak but you", "43:03", "don't have that much more time than a", "43:04", "standard scuba tank but we have is", "43:06", "refill stations all around the floor", "43:08", "with high-pressure hoses so we have", "43:10", "these quick disconnects on our system", "43:12", "that you can plug in and fill it right", "43:15", "back up and then you get to go for you", "43:17", "know another couple hours so when you", "43:19", "swim to go take a poo you have to do", "43:21", "that you have to wear the tank or do you", "43:23", "just hold your breath just hold your", "43:25", "breath you're not gone that far how far", "43:26", "you going yeah 15 feet or so in total", "43:29", "pitch-black yeah there's a light on the", "43:32", "gazebo but that's all so you see that", "43:34", "light out there and you know if you get", "43:36", "to there that's where you're pulling", "43:37", "yeah good lord", "43:39", "yeah Wow that's got to be so strange", "43:42", "yeah", "43:43", "what was it like to get back from that", "43:45", "I've probably fill it seems like it", "43:49", "would be real similar to getting back", "43:51", "from space yeah it is the thing about it", "43:54", "the way it makes us such a great", "43:55", "training exercise psychologically is if", "43:58", "you had to get to a hospital", "43:59", "it takes about the same time from that", "44:01", "habitat as a would from the space", "44:03", "station in both cases it takes about a", "44:05", "day I think the space station you got to", "44:07", "get in the Soyuz you got to put your", "44:09", "spacesuit on you got a detach the Soyuz", "44:11", "from the space station you got to", "44:12", "separate from the space station got to", "44:14", "do a deorbit burn you got a land the", "44:16", "helicopters got to come get you by time", "44:17", "all that's done it's like a day and the", "44:20", "Soyuz is a Russian craft yeah so we have", "44:23", "to use Russian crafts", "44:24", "back from the space station right now we", "44:26", "have to use Rachel craft to go and come", "44:28", "back how weird is that", "44:29", "it's not cool what happened all right", "44:32", "so it's not good none of us are happy", "44:35", "about this but what happened was the", "44:37", "shuttles the shuttle let me just say", "44:40", "this is a magnificent flying machine", "44:42", "I mean what's really remarkable if you", "44:44", "go down to like the California Science", "44:46", "Center and you look at endeavour we", "44:48", "design that thing in the 70s like it", "44:50", "doesn't even have a microwave it's got a", "44:52", "conventional convection oven Wow so it's", "44:56", "like ancient technology that the flight", "44:58", "computers on that thing your your Apple", "45:01", "watch could run circles around them I", "45:03", "mean it's like nothing there they're so", "45:06", "primitive but but it did it took off", "45:09", "like a rocket and landed like an", "45:11", "airplane you had you could carry people", "45:13", "you carry the Hubble Space Telescope in", "45:15", "a trunk you can do a space walk from his", "45:18", "has a robot arm that you see there", "45:21", "yeah there's endeavour so that's my", "45:24", "flight actually that's sts-123 in the", "45:27", "middle that's the robot that we put", "45:29", "together Wow but but anyway the it's an", "45:34", "incredible machine and we'll never", "45:35", "design anything like it maybe ever again", "45:38", "certainly not anytime soon so despite", "45:40", "its technological in incredibleness for", "45:44", "lack of a better word it had a couple", "45:47", "key limitations one was it's not that", "45:50", "safe you know so we lost two of them", "45:52", "Challenger in Columbia and we could talk", "45:55", "about that I knew I knew the guys in", "45:57", "Columbian that was really really rough", "45:59", "and then the second thing was a super", "46:02", "expensive because it took so much", "46:03", "maintenance even though it was reusable", "46:05", "or most of it was it took so much", "46:08", "maintenance it took a standing army to", "46:09", "keep it running we're spending I think", "46:11", "three or four billion dollars a year on", "46:13", "the program and and there's no way if we", "46:16", "wanted to build something that was gonna", "46:17", "be more cost effective or safer there's", "46:20", "no way we're going to get a plus up from", "46:22", "Congress so like an addition of four", "46:23", "billion dollars a year to go do that the", "46:25", "only way really to make it happen was to", "46:27", "stop flying the shuttle so he we took a", "46:30", "very painful decision and we said okay", "46:33", "we're gonna retire these things so we", "46:35", "can make something new and we know that", "46:37", "there's going to be a gap", "46:38", "period where we're not gonna have", "46:39", "anything and it's gonna suck but the", "46:41", "good news is is Annie that the great", "46:44", "timing about this conversation right now", "46:46", "is that gap ends this year really yeah", "46:49", "2020 is when that painful period is put", "46:53", "to rest and what what happens we're", "46:55", "gonna have the spacex dragon space X", "46:57", "dragon yeah it's a great name yeah I", "47:00", "love it yeah we're gonna have a brave", "47:02", "new ship and not only a dragon we're", "47:03", "gonna have the Boeing Star liner and and", "47:06", "then we have two other private companies", "47:08", "that are gonna be launching people this", "47:09", "year yeah it's incredible these four", "47:12", "companies all trying to put humans into", "47:15", "space with private companies yeah and", "47:17", "the schedules are just aligning so it's", "47:19", "all looks like it all will happen in", "47:21", "2020 now there they've done some people", "47:25", "civilian trips up in the space right", "47:28", "they have and that's all happens because", "47:31", "by paying the Russians that's what it is", "47:33", "all right yeah why is their equipment so", "47:36", "much better it's not the it's the only", "47:40", "game in town once we once we retired the", "47:42", "shuttles there was nothing else", "47:44", "available I would be like hey um how are", "47:47", "you guys maintaining these things yeah", "47:49", "what are you doing like tell me tell me", "47:51", "what's your maintenance schedule it's", "47:53", "been a little scary lately because I've", "47:54", "had some they've had some mishaps right", "47:56", "like what well we had a launch goes", "47:59", "squirrely where the rocket didn't work", "48:01", "right and handed that a punch off Nick", "48:04", "cake was the American on that", "48:05", "unfortunately he was fine he went off I", "48:07", "mean II eject yeah oh fuck yeah that's", "48:11", "something you want to like do for fun so", "48:13", "during launch yeah so you're launching", "48:16", "Shh no like this is not good yeah when", "48:19", "it when it has these beside boosters", "48:21", "uh-huh and one of them got stuck it", "48:23", "didn't come off right and they were", "48:24", "starting to spin out of control and then", "48:26", "they punched out oh my god how far how", "48:28", "far up are they when they punch out", "48:30", "that's it so we say punch out or punch", "48:31", "out punch out John abort you say abort", "48:35", "okay but I don't in that case I don't", "48:39", "know the exact out to do they were", "48:40", "fairly high they were probably I think", "48:43", "they were still in the atmosphere so I'm", "48:45", "guessing it I'm guessing something like", "48:47", "40 to 70 kilometers up or so and so they", "48:52", "punch out and abort and then are you in", "48:55", "like a capsule like what are you in in a", "48:58", "capsule and then from that point on it's", "48:59", "kind of like a normal landing if you", "49:01", "survive the giant you know yank I think", "49:04", "they were pulling something like five or", "49:07", "six G's I think when a 20 was separate", "49:09", "or maybe even more that system when they", "49:12", "pulled off and then and then and then at", "49:16", "that point you're falling in the capsule", "49:17", "and then the parachutes come out hmm", "49:18", "and and it from that point on it's kind", "49:21", "of like a normal landing oh the G's got", "49:23", "to be crazy right I've did a flight with", "49:26", "the Blue Angels once oh yeah and I think", "49:28", "we went seven and a half G's or", "49:30", "something like that wasn't that that bad", "49:32", "but it's so weird yeah then you see the", "49:35", "consciousness closing in like an", "49:37", "elevator door you see the blackness on", "49:38", "the sides a soda straw going yes", "49:40", "very weird so that like in space like to", "49:44", "get ejected or I guess actually not in", "49:46", "space in the atmosphere and do you have", "49:48", "to climb into that thing before you can", "49:50", "abort or are you in it already", "49:53", "there's no time it's a it's a rocket and", "49:55", "in that case it's a rocket on the top", "49:56", "that pulls the capsule away from the", "49:58", "booster oh wow", "49:59", "just like we did with Apollo and Gemini", "50:01", "mm-hmm now I'm dragon and also on", "50:04", "Starliner we've got much more advanced", "50:06", "systems that are built into the into the", "50:08", "capsule and so they they they're they", "50:12", "push instead of having a tower up on top", "50:14", "that pulls you away they have engines", "50:16", "down here that that push and fly away", "50:17", "hmm and the nice thing about that is the", "50:21", "tower you actually if you don't need it", "50:23", "you have to you have to throw it away", "50:25", "you have to jettison it but that's kind", "50:27", "of like needing to use your ejection", "50:28", "seat every single time you go for a", "50:30", "flight because if you for some reason if", "50:33", "it doesn't jettison you're dead you", "50:35", "can't get the parachutes up with that", "50:37", "thing stuck up on top so that's like a", "50:39", "failure mode that if you put the engines", "50:41", "down here you don't have to worry about", "50:42", "that mmm plus you carry it with you the", "50:44", "whole time so you could use those", "50:46", "powerful engines to really get quickly", "50:47", "away from the booster like the Falcon 9", "50:50", "if it's having a bad day you can use", "50:52", "even if it's blowing up yeah does it", "50:59", "look like can you pull up the SpaceX", "51:01", "what's it dragon what the crew dragon", "51:03", "prude", "51:03", "dragon well there she is that looks like", "51:06", "something from the future that's the if", "51:08", "that's the test we just did that's an", "51:10", "artist drawing of it but this is the", "51:12", "final big test we had to do before we", "51:14", "actually put people inside and we did", "51:17", "that successfully just a couple weeks", "51:18", "ago oh so what we did was we lit up", "51:22", "those those eject engines there that's", "51:24", "an actual shot yeah", "51:25", "that's insane look at that thing yeah it", "51:27", "looks like a UFO yeah it's crazy in a", "51:30", "rocket went kablooey not that we blew it", "51:32", "up but it started once it's separated", "51:35", "the rocket start tumbling out of control", "51:36", "and it made a giant fireball and is that", "51:39", "normal or expected we kind of thought", "51:41", "that would happen yeah well you were", "51:42", "right we're planning on using it again", "51:46", "there it is so they're there did", "51:48", "separate in from the booster Wow and the", "51:51", "booster went kaboom but the rocket but", "51:53", "it was a I think if I remember right I", "51:55", "think it was a 1.5 kilometers away when", "51:59", "when the rocket went kaboom and it was", "52:01", "fine now when you guys do these test", "52:04", "flights", "52:04", "do they have to anticipate where this", "52:07", "stuff is going to land like where the I", "52:10", "mean yeah all this giant metal with fire", "52:14", "any chute so what as you're launching", "52:17", "you have to take into consideration yeah", "52:19", "what the trajectory is wow that's the", "52:20", "explosion CSX complete successful abort", "52:23", "test launch of Dragon crew capsule Wow", "52:27", "yeah so you have to think about where it", "52:30", "so they have to calculate what speed how", "52:33", "fast the earth is spinning where it's", "52:35", "gonna drop well that's that's why and", "52:37", "theoretically you know you got to be", "52:39", "ready for this any given flight mm-hmm", "52:41", "now this one we knew it was gonna happen", "52:42", "but it could happen any time so you", "52:45", "always that's why we always launch out", "52:46", "over the ocean oh okay", "52:48", "and that's why Cape Canaveral where Cape", "52:50", "Canaveral is because if you look at a", "52:52", "map of Florida", "52:54", "that's the Cape is where Florida juts", "52:56", "out as a little prominence that juts out", "52:58", "to the east into the Atlantic and that", "53:00", "way you can go due east which is", "53:03", "generally what you want to do when you", "53:04", "launch or you can even turn a little bit", "53:05", "north or south and you're not gonna fly", "53:07", "over anybody's house or Disneyland or", "53:08", "anything", "53:09", "and if something goes wrong in the old", "53:12", "days like on the shuttle we actually had", "53:14", "explosives on the tank and air these", "53:16", "dudes these rain safety control offers", "53:18", "officers that would sit with a big red", "53:20", "button oh Jesus", "53:21", "and if they see you going out of control", "53:23", "and you're heading back towards land", "53:24", "yeah boom oh my god what a", "53:28", "responsibility they have we used to go", "53:30", "by before launch and meet those guys", "53:32", "look them in the eye and almost look", "53:34", "like psychos showing pictures of our", "53:36", "family don't get itchy bro don't get it", "53:40", "you had that trigger so give it a potato", "53:42", "it seems like a crazy way to handle it", "53:45", "that the junk has to fall in the ocean", "53:47", "yeah well now the Russians and the", "53:50", "Chinese don't necessarily honor that", "53:51", "they actually the Chinese have dropped", "53:53", "nasty burnin boosters on you know it's", "53:57", "sparsely populated but they still have", "53:59", "dropped these things on like villages", "54:00", "and stuff oh boy they're little less", "54:03", "really concerned about this kind of", "54:05", "thing the fuck in China but in the US we", "54:12", "always so we launch and the reason that", "54:14", "you usually want to launch to the east", "54:15", "is you want to take advantage of the", "54:17", "Earth's rotation to give you like a", "54:18", "slingshot effect mmm because if you go", "54:20", "to the east the earth is rotating this", "54:22", "way it kind of slingshot you into orbit", "54:24", "going with the rotation and that's why", "54:27", "you also might be as close to the", "54:28", "equator as you can because if you're", "54:30", "ever you had the north pole and you", "54:31", "launched East it's not gonna help you", "54:32", "all right but the lower you are towards", "54:34", "it equator and more of a slingshot you", "54:35", "get now did they have to figure out over", "54:39", "time where those things were dropping", "54:41", "did they ever make some mistakes I don't", "54:44", "think is that we've had Rockets blow up", "54:46", "on the pad and do a bunch of damage but", "54:48", "once they're up and out I don't think we", "54:50", "ever in the u.s. anyway had that problem", "54:53", "because we always had the ability to", "54:54", "blow it up", "54:55", "if it's there the red lines and if it", "54:57", "passes the red line you push the button", "54:59", "now it's all done autonomously so you", "55:01", "have GPS monitors on board that", "55:04", "self-destruct if it sees it as going", "55:07", "past the line there's nobody with the", "55:08", "button anymore it's all automatic oh wow", "55:10", "and these boosters that fall into the", "55:13", "ocean do they have them documented like", "55:15", "where they're landing so they know where", "55:17", "these things are scattered out", "55:18", "throughout the ocean they know", "55:19", "approximately and and one cool thing was", "55:22", "probably the most", "55:22", "famous booster that landed then the", "55:24", "bottom of the ocean was Apollo 11 the", "55:26", "Saturn 5 and it was just sitting there", "55:30", "you know as a fish habitat oh wow and", "55:32", "Jeff Bezos with his own out of his own", "55:35", "pocket mounted an expedition and went", "55:38", "and got him got those engines that's", "55:40", "when you know you're a baller yeah throw", "55:44", "some money at pulling the rocket", "55:46", "boosters from Apollo 11 out of the ocean", "55:48", "holy shit like crazy am I gonna do this", "55:52", "weekend maybe I'll watch a movie or now", "55:53", "no go get those engines look at that", "55:56", "Wow there you go powerful Jeff Bezos and", "56:00", "a hard part was finding the right ones", "56:02", "and they got them as I saw the serial", "56:04", "number they're like yeah look at the", "56:06", "image finding the right ones cuz there's", "56:08", "a bunch down there yeah there was a", "56:09", "bunch of cyber fives", "56:10", "Wow and they found the right ones look", "56:13", "at that that's nuts and perfectly", "56:16", "preserved yeah and then when did he do", "56:19", "this what yesterday night 10 that pushed", "56:21", "Buzz and Neil and my team to them Wow", "56:25", "that's madness yeah what a crazy image", "56:31", "boosters landing in China", "56:33", "oh yeah oh that's what I'm hitting the", "56:35", "ground yes Oh rewinding that again that", "56:37", "is very quick I started right where the", "56:39", "explosion was there's other ones it's", "56:41", "just falling from the sky nighted on", "56:43", "impact with the ground so these people", "56:45", "are just chillin and a giant chunk of", "56:47", "metals falls from the sky oh my god", "56:49", "that's crazy", "56:51", "know that but that's hypergolic fuels so", "56:53", "that's like you don't want to be", "56:54", "breathing that stuff that's pretty toxic", "56:55", "look at it just landed on people like", "56:58", "whoops sorry that's a that's a BRC big", "57:02", "great cloud you know or b.o.b FRC you", "57:06", "know what yeah you know I've been here", "57:07", "that what is in that cloud", "57:09", "it's hydrazine so it's a nto MMH mono", "57:12", "methyl hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide", "57:14", "it's it's stuff they don't want to drink", "57:17", "look at that falling from the sky oh my", "57:19", "god that's crazy yeah", "57:22", "it fell on a small village China doesn't", "57:26", "give a fuck", "57:27", "they just let it go it is I mean that", "57:30", "those villagers are getting pre unlucky", "57:32", "because it is pretty sparsely populated", "57:33", "so you're just playing the odds but if", "57:36", "we went we wouldn't do that well that", "57:37", "has to be terrible for their breathing", "57:40", "and their health yeah that stuff was", "57:43", "gonna linger right yeah I got we get", "57:46", "into the drinking water", "57:47", "uh-huh I mean it the quantity is of that", "57:50", "are probably not gonna be like absolute", "57:52", "catastrophic either the bigger risk is", "57:53", "getting blown up by it but it's still", "57:55", "not good so why doesn't China adhere to", "57:59", "the same sort of well they do what they", "58:01", "got to do yeah yeah so when when you're", "58:05", "a part of these expeditions and you know", "58:08", "you're you recognize that you're one of", "58:11", "very few people that ever gets to", "58:13", "experience this these kind of things do", "58:17", "you feel like a responsibility to try to", "58:18", "relay this information to people like", "58:21", "yeah it's part of our job you know so", "58:24", "when we're when I was that NASA they", "58:25", "would send us out to do these PR events", "58:27", "and we go to schools and I would go back", "58:29", "to like Jersey where I'm from and go", "58:31", "visit all these school systems and part", "58:33", "of Jersey from my parents are from", "58:36", "Newark and I grew up in pursue my - yeah", "58:38", "yeah I heard about that yeah Parsippany", "58:41", "I know where that is Persephone that's", "58:43", "right that's right career I went to", "58:44", "press seven high school Wow", "58:45", "um and so you go back and try to inspire", "58:48", "kids - yeah - pursue this case same kind", "58:51", "of thing and I still do it so I was just", "58:53", "in Israel last week I just got back two", "58:56", "nights ago actually so every year on the", "58:58", "anniversary of the Columbia tragedy they", "59:01", "have a space week in Israel where they", "59:02", "have a whole bunch of STEM education", "59:03", "events and there's also a technical", "59:07", "conference and then there's a memorial", "59:09", "for the first Israeli astronaut that was", "59:11", "on Columbia Elan so I got to know his", "59:13", "family really well and I go back there", "59:16", "every year and and we had the memorial", "59:18", "last Friday and so yeah I'm still and I", "59:22", "tried it I think I met every school kid", "59:24", "in Israel and got the you know it's good", "59:29", "just try to get them excited about the", "59:30", "future about a bright future you know", "59:32", "well the reason why one the reason why I", "59:34", "brought this up is I saw a video we", "59:36", "talked about how your during your", "59:37", "childhood you got a photo on your wall", "59:39", "of look", "59:40", "at the Earth from the moon the", "59:42", "photograph that was taken yeah and that", "59:45", "that's what set the seed or planted the", "59:48", "seed in your head yeah right so I also I", "59:51", "also go out and I do a lot of you know", "59:53", "public appearances and do motivational", "59:56", "speaking kind of stuff and I talk about", "59:58", "the importance of both inspiration and", "60:00", "determination so I found out when I was", "60:03", "a kid that they were they were taken not", "60:07", "only fighter pilots but also like", "60:08", "engineers and scientists to be", "60:09", "astronauts because I was was totally", "60:12", "super stoked by that the whole concept", "60:14", "of going into space but I had a mom", "60:16", "that's like scared to fly she was", "60:18", "typical Jewish mom she was like she's", "60:20", "like I told her once I wanted to join", "60:22", "the Air Force and she in it like a", "60:24", "public restaurant and she starts", "60:25", "freaking out and like started like", "60:27", "soliciting opinions from the other", "60:29", "parents would you listen", "60:30", "you know the hilarious oh so I never", "60:34", "thought I knew that like being a test", "60:35", "pilot was not gonna happen so I thought", "60:37", "being an astronaut wasn't gonna happen", "60:39", "but then I found out that you could do", "60:41", "it you can be an engineer and be an", "60:43", "astronaut and then like that was my", "60:46", "Eureka moment I was inspired but to be", "60:49", "determined I got that photo and I put it", "60:50", "over my desk and was like that was my", "60:52", "like that was the beacon you know that", "60:54", "was the goal and I kept working and any", "60:57", "time I was having a difficult time I", "60:59", "looked up at that thing and say no one", "61:01", "day I'm gonna hang that in the astronaut", "61:02", "office and Johnson Space Center and I", "61:05", "still have that thing that must have", "61:07", "been surreal the moment when you were on", "61:09", "that spacewalk thinking about your", "61:11", "childhood and thinking about being", "61:12", "inspired by those images yeah he's like", "61:15", "holy shit I'm actually an astronaut I'm", "61:20", "eeen you really are an astronaut I mean", "61:23", "how many are there", "61:24", "there's there I think there's been", "61:26", "around 500 people that have been to", "61:28", "space ever yeah that's nuts not a lot", "61:32", "and now with SpaceX what is your role", "61:35", "with SpaceX so I left NASA in 2011 and I", "61:40", "went down and met with Elon and I said", "61:42", "hey I really like what you're doing here", "61:43", "can I help and can i and he gave me a", "61:46", "job so I went I left NASA and I came", "61:48", "here and I worked there for seven years", "61:50", "did a bunch of different things", "61:52", "eventually became our director of space", "61:54", "operations so my team was responsible", "61:56", "for operating Mission Control at SpaceX", "61:59", "and controlling we have another Dragon", "62:01", "capsule that we use for cargo to take", "62:03", "cargo and we've been doing that for a", "62:04", "long time up to the space station and", "62:07", "back and so we would operate in Mission", "62:09", "Control but we're also we're designing", "62:10", "then the crew one that we showed you so", "62:13", "we were coming up with the procedures", "62:14", "and all the rules of how we're going to", "62:15", "use that thing and and and meeting all", "62:18", "of NASA's requirements and helping to", "62:20", "provide input to the guys designing the", "62:22", "displays and the suits and the controls", "62:24", "and the seats and all the stuff you need", "62:25", "for people and so that was that was you", "62:28", "know I did that for quiet quite a long", "62:30", "time well what do you have thoughts on", "62:32", "this what what's happening now with", "62:35", "space travel where it's transferring", "62:37", "into the public sector or the private", "62:38", "sector rather instead of being something", "62:40", "that the government handles now it's", "62:42", "private companies is that a good thing", "62:44", "it's a great thing is that yeah because", "62:46", "first of all it's not quite that black", "62:49", "and white in the media it's all", "62:51", "portrayed as commercial space and like", "62:53", "these private companies are taken over", "62:54", "the truth is at least for the human", "62:56", "orbital spaceflight that we're doing at", "62:58", "SpaceX and that Boeing is doing with", "63:00", "with their vehicle it's a part as a", "63:02", "public-private partnership and so NASA", "63:05", "is working very closely with both those", "63:06", "companies and we're working together and", "63:09", "in a way it's not really that different", "63:11", "from the way it's always been you know", "63:13", "like NASA didn't have a NASA factory", "63:15", "that built the Saturn 5 rocket is built", "63:19", "here by like McDonnell Douglas and North", "63:21", "American Rockwell built if I remember", "63:23", "right North American built and built a", "63:25", "command module and and the lunar lander", "63:28", "was built by Grumman so those were all", "63:29", "private companies they're contractors", "63:31", "but they're still private companies and", "63:34", "what's happening now is just a slight", "63:36", "change to the relationship between NASA", "63:39", "and the private companies where NASA is", "63:41", "not micromanaging quite as much as they", "63:43", "used to they're saying ok here's our top", "63:45", "level requirements we want you to get", "63:47", "four people up and down to the space", "63:48", "station that's a bit of a simplification", "63:50", "because actually the requirements", "63:52", "document is like there are thousands of", "63:54", "requirements but they're but they don't", "63:56", "go down and tell you how to meet each", "63:58", "requirement they leave it up to you so", "64:00", "now SpaceX there's a lot more room to", "64:02", "innovate then like North American", "64:05", "Rockwell did when when they built", "64:07", "the vehicles back during Apollo so that", "64:11", "that and the other thing that's", "64:12", "different is that the funding the way", "64:14", "the NASA is paying its firm fixed price", "64:16", "you know all these that like the Space", "64:18", "Shuttle when we build an aircraft", "64:19", "carrier it's it's cost plus contracting", "64:22", "which has been terribly abused and has", "64:24", "been horrible for the US taxpayer it", "64:27", "what it says to the company is you can", "64:29", "it could cost whatever costs that's what", "64:32", "will pay and in fact will give you a", "64:35", "profit as a percentage of the cost so", "64:38", "like you're in it your incentive as the", "64:40", "company's like to make the cost as high", "64:41", "as you can so your profit as high as it", "64:43", "could but that's ridiculous yeah so it's", "64:45", "not cool and and but it they had to do", "64:48", "it that way like during World War two is", "64:49", "when it started because like nobody knew", "64:52", "how much was gonna cost to build a p-51", "64:53", "Mustang because nobody did one before", "64:55", "hmm so they came up with this mechanism", "64:57", "but now it's kind of been abused now", "64:59", "we're using it to do things that we've", "65:01", "done before and then the third thing is", "65:04", "that that the companies own the", "65:05", "intellectual property so what that means", "65:08", "is like Rockwell when they built the", "65:12", "Space Shuttle couldn't like build a new", "65:14", "Space Shuttle like build like Space", "65:16", "Shuttle enterprise or something and then", "65:18", "go sell tickets on it they weren't", "65:21", "allowed to but we can so we can we're", "65:23", "gonna build this dragon we're gonna take", "65:24", "Bob banking and Doug Hurley two friends", "65:27", "of mine are gonna be the first", "65:27", "astronauts that ride it to the space", "65:29", "station and once we meet our NASA NASA's", "65:33", "our number one customer they're paying", "65:34", "the bill so once they are satisfied we", "65:37", "can then go make another one and sell", "65:39", "tickets and take you know private", "65:41", "individuals so really that's the key", "65:44", "difference and I really think that 2020", "65:47", "we're gonna look back at 2020 as it as a", "65:50", "year that everything changed really yeah", "65:52", "because all those dreams of science", "65:55", "fiction I like being able to take your", "65:57", "vacations around the rings of Saturn and", "66:00", "like all the like private space stations", "66:03", "all that kind of stuff that we grew up", "66:04", "hoping would happen when we were older I", "66:06", "think it's really finally starting", "66:09", "because this is this is the beginning of", "66:10", "that infrastructure that that private", "66:12", "sector commercial infrastructure and and", "66:15", "an ability to actually get it done we're", "66:18", "always talking about how", "66:19", "only got the future in like space 1999", "66:23", "that television show I like that show I", "66:25", "said all the time yeah but all those", "66:27", "shows like even I think Blade Runner was", "66:31", "like now right didn't we discuss this", "66:33", "like last year 2019 like we got", "66:37", "everything wrong in terms of what the", "66:39", "timeline was the timeline is totally", "66:41", "wrong but I think that the overall the", "66:43", "overall direction is is right in a lot", "66:46", "of this stuff and we'll get there I", "66:48", "really do believe that if we don't end", "66:49", "up killing each other or have some", "66:52", "horrible catastrophe like asteroid hit", "66:54", "us we're going to end up living in space", "66:56", "and have that kind of Star Trek future I", "66:58", "mean I really think that's our destiny", "67:00", "as long as we don't screw it up man how", "67:05", "far out are we looking at Star Trek Star", "67:09", "Trek might take a while did we get like", "67:10", "warp drive another hundred years and we", "67:12", "got to find those Dively thorium captain", "67:16", "she's predicting hope that like how far", "67:19", "do you think we are like if you had a", "67:20", "wide timeline of like literally being", "67:24", "able to go to another planet well you", "67:27", "know well going to Mars is something we", "67:29", "could do now in a decade if we really", "67:33", "really really want", "67:34", "ilan keep saying that I think he's right", "67:36", "I mean it's it's not a question of", "67:39", "technology the big missing piece I think", "67:42", "in an understanding about what that", "67:44", "would be like is is the effect of", "67:46", "radiation on the human body", "67:48",

"67:56", "right now like on the space station I", "67:57", "took a bigger radiation hit than I would", "68:01", "have if I stayed at home but much of", "68:03", "ahead you know the manner dose I took", "68:06", "was not that much it's like like a tenth", "68:12", "of a sievert or something I mean it's", "68:13", "like it was produced receiver a sievert", "68:15", "if you take one sievert then you're", "68:18", "increasing your chance of getting cancer", "68:19", "depending on your age and gender about a", "68:22", "couple additional percent can you", "68:23", "mitigate that with

not a", "68:33", "see it's not gonna fix this problem that", "68:35", "could help maybe they say take iodine", "68:37", "tablets right if you're exposed to", "68:39", "radiation isn't that like something that", "68:41", "they recommend yeah for like for the", "68:43", "nuclear reactors you know and and all", "68:46", "that but I think that protects that", "68:50", "protects function of some one under the", "68:52", "organs I can't remember but it's not", "68:54", "going to solve that's not gonna solve", "68:55", "this problem but you can shield yourself", "68:58", "with anything that has hydrogen in it", "69:00", "it's a pretty good shield so water is", "69:02", "great like when I was on the space", "69:04", "station I put a big water jug around my", "69:07", "head really it just I figured couldn't", "69:09", "hurt and and then like liquid hydrogen", "69:13", "or even plastic that's made just derived", "69:15", "from hydrogen is pretty good shielding", "69:18", "okay so you could have like conceivably", "69:21", "a light plastic suit that you wear that", "69:23", "could shield you from a lot of the", "69:25", "radiation on the way to Mars there's", "69:26", "actually a company in Israel that is", "69:28", "teaming with NASA is gonna fly these", "69:29", "like vests on to try to shield the", "69:31", "people you can also put it in the hull", "69:33", "and or you can have just a storm shelter", "69:35", "because there's basically once when", "69:38", "we're on the space station we're above", "69:39", "all the atmosphere but we're still below", "69:41", "the

"to Mars then you basically hanging it", "69:52", "out there you're you're not you're no", "69:54", "longer protected by that and so you're", "69:55", "gonna take either GCR galactic cosmic", "69:58", "radiation which is just everywhere out", "70:00", "there sounds terrible it sounds bad that", "70:02", "it GCR galactic cosmic radiation that", "70:06", "sounds really bad yeah yeah those are", "70:11", "that those are ionized that there aren't", "70:17", "that many of them but when they hit you", "70:18", "they can do a lot of damage they have a", "70:20", "lot of energy there's accelerated

every once a", "70:41", "while in their giant spikes they last a", "70:43", "couple hours to a couple days and they", "70:45", "could totally fry you", "70:47", "they're even worse oh fuck yeah so", "70:49", "conceivably we could send people to Mars", "70:51", "and halfway there they get cooked yeah", "70:53", "so you have a six-month window where you", "70:56", "have to just roll the dice well so what", "70:58", "you can do is you can have a storm", "70:59", "shelter right at way you put like a lot", "71:02", "of this shielding and then if you could", "71:04", "detect it the the SPE you the GCR is", "71:06", "there all the time but the solar events", "71:08", "you could you can detect them coming and", "71:10", "you have enough warning time to get", "71:12", "everybody into the storm sure how much", "71:13", "time you have", "71:15", "usually when you first start seeing some", "71:18", "of the proton radiation then you start", "71:23", "you have like an hour oh so you got time", "71:28", "going 48 minutes from now it's coming", "71:32", "yeah just like hunker down there", "71:35", "probably grabbing all the water bottles", "71:36", "you can Wow", "71:38", "and depending upon how big the ejection", "71:41", "is you don't know how long it's gonna", "71:42", "last", "71:43", "yeah they could be a different", "71:45", "magnitudes and different discs ill you", "71:47", "even if you have the shoulder the", "71:49", "shielding I mean if it's a really huge", "71:51", "one and and we didn't really have any", "71:54", "capability of defending from it when we", "71:56", "did Apollo and there was a between two", "71:58", "Apollo missions there's one of these big", "72:00", "ones oh boy and we just got lucky that", "72:01", "it was in between so that seems crazy", "72:05", "what a nutty roll of the dice yeah but", "72:09", "again there's there's and we keep", "72:10", "getting smarter about it and and and and", "72:13", "I think you know for like right now we", "72:15", "can send you to Mars and bring you back", "72:16", "and and probabilistically speaking you'd", "72:20", "probably have like an additional four or", "72:22", "five percent chance of developing cancer", "72:24", "over your lifetime which it's not like a", "72:27", "death sentence you know it's a little", "72:29", "it's a little uncomfortable yeah yeah", "72:31", "but we're getting better and and the", "72:33", "thing about it there's two things about", "72:34", "it one we keep getting better", "72:35", "technologies better shielding we can", "72:37", "actually come up with there's ways you", "72:40", "can do active shielding with magnetic", "72:42", "you can create your own magnetic field", "72:43", "around the ship and and and so it always", "72:47", "be like Star Trek with like you know a", "72:48", "force a force field or shields or", "72:50", "whatever so we're there's a ways that", "72:53", "maybe we could do that there's also the", "72:56", "other thing that we don't know we know", "72:58", "exactly what radiation is out there", "73:00", "we don't know exactly what that", "73:02", "radiation does to humans the best we", "73:05", "have to go on is like data from some of", "73:08", "the atomic bomb survivors and and", "73:10", "radiation workers then working like", "73:12", "power plants and stuff to take some dose", "73:13", "but it's a different kind of

we can find out", "73:24", "what it really does the humans maybe", "73:26", "it's a lot more benign and maybe we", "73:29", "could sharpen that pencil and say yeah", "73:30", "it's acceptable what if people come back", "73:32", "smarter what if it's like some fucking", "73:34", "x-men type shit yeah maybe like you know", "73:37", "I mean radiation is always bad in real", "73:39", "life but always good in comic books", "73:41", "yeah spider-man if the Hulk spider-man", "73:46", "is so many superheroes they were", "73:49", "involved in some sort of an accident", "73:50", "wasn't dr. Manhattan wasn't that a thing", "73:53", "with him as well I think so", "73:54", "yeah I think so I don't from The", "73:56", "Watchmen I think he became who he is", "73:59", "because of an accident a document I", "74:01", "believe so yeah and I was hoping that", "74:03", "you know I was up I had my kids after I", "74:05", "did that flight oh so I'm hoping that", "74:08", "they would like one day genius kids yeah", "74:10", "how old are your kids now I got a", "74:12", "nine-year-old boy and a two-year-old", "74:14", "girl notice anything unusual about them", "74:15", "I didn't notice one day the two year old", "74:17", "girl was concentrating on her blocks and", "74:19", "one of them started floating oh man so", "74:23", "what what changes have been made since", "74:27", "you go from the old shuttle model of", "74:29", "that technology to the SpaceX dragon", "74:32", "crew thing probably the single biggest", "74:35", "changes is all the we've gotten a lot", "74:37", "better at electronics and software so", "74:40", "the vehicle is highly automated and", "74:42", "that's why we can fly like like normal", "74:45", "people that don't have like years and", "74:47", "years of training because it's so much", "74:50", "more smarter than the shot of the", "74:51", "shuttle you shouldn't say so much more", "74:53", "smarter so much butter but you're such a", "74:56", "genius you're not supposed to use", "74:57", "language like that you're goddamn", "74:58", "astronaut so much more smarter I'm sorry", "75:09", "though I was a math as though as my", "75:11", "thing that verbal my verbal SATs weren't", "75:13", "that spare", "75:14", "about the you know yeah this is much", "75:18", "more smarter and what about what about", "75:20", "the there was always an issue with the", "75:22", "tiles right with the re-entry time I was", "75:25", "like and then that's that's what did", "75:27", "Challenger and know which one was Olivia", "75:29", "Columbia that's what did Colombian the", "75:31", "the new design have they made advances", "75:36", "and how that stuff is applied or is it a", "75:38", "different surface they use yeah so that", "75:41", "that is something that's also not really", "75:43", "worry anymore that the reason that", "75:44", "Columbia took that damage was it was", "75:47", "foam like the big orange tank that's", "75:49", "behind the Space Shuttle it sticks up", "75:51", "above the space shuttle and some foam", "75:53", "fell off of it we always had some foam", "75:55", "shedding off the thing and in the", "75:57", "beginning we took that very very", "75:58", "seriously as a major problem but the", "76:01", "thing is is this there's this concept of", "76:04", "mmm gonna forget the name of it now well", "76:08", "let me just describe it so so you get", "76:10", "away with something for so long that you", "76:14", "begin it's not normalization of deviance", "76:16", "that's what it's called so it's when you", "76:19", "get away with something for so much so", "76:20", "long it's something that was a deviant", "76:22", "thing or something that was bad it's", "76:24", "treated as a normal thing and that's", "76:26", "what happened to us because we knew that", "76:28", "that foam coming off could do damage to", "76:30", "the Space Shuttle and in the beginning", "76:32", "we tried really hard to do something", "76:33", "about it we treated it very seriously", "76:35", "but it was hard we couldn't really come", "76:37", "up with an easy fix in the meantime were", "76:40", "flying and nothing bad was happening", "76:41", "what was really happening is what we", "76:44", "were getting lucky and then eventually a", "76:46", "big piece came off hit Columbia right in", "76:48", "the wing and it shattered a mint a big", "76:51", "hole inside the wing but nobody knew for", "76:53", "sure and they made a bad decision to not", "76:58", "like investigate it further assumed it", "77:00", "was okay", "77:01", "brought him home and and obviously you", "77:03", "know what happened so it could be", "77:06", "possible to fix something like that if", "77:08", "they had known it could have been", "77:10", "possible we did a lot of things like", "77:11", "when I flew we had a lot of things in", "77:13", "place that to try to fix that one we got", "77:15", "a rid of a lot of the foam that was", "77:16", "unnecessary we tried to do things that", "77:18", "stopped the foam we also had ways of", "77:20", "detecting it so that we would know we", "77:22", "had sensors and the wings we added a", "77:25", "maneuver we do when we fly up to the", "77:26", "space station we did like a", "77:28", "pitchover where we took photographs of", "77:30", "the of the heat shield to see if", "77:32", "anything got hit hmm", "77:34", "so at least we would know and then we", "77:36", "could we could shelter in place on the", "77:38", "space station so there's a lot of things", "77:40", "we can do at the shuttle but the night", "77:41", "the thing about with Dragon and", "77:42", "Starliner and the new vehicles is they", "77:44", "sit on top so there's no any foam that", "77:47", "comes off the rocket is not gonna hit", "77:48", "you so problem solved so that that's one", "77:51", "example of how we don't have to worry", "77:52", "about that anymore", "77:53", "now is the surface different do they", "77:55", "still have the same kind of tiles the", "77:58", "the heat shield it looks like again the", "78:02", "heat shield is that the material on the", "78:04", "side of the capsule on the walls of the", "78:05", "capsule is is made out of silica so it's", "78:08", "it's similar to the tiles but the the", "78:12", "the material that's in the in the heat", "78:14", "shield itself is an ablative material it", "78:16", "means it kind of like as it heats up it", "78:18", "flakes off and it takes the heat away", "78:20", "with it and that's that's kind of more", "78:22", "similar to like it was during Apollo", "78:24", "it's a much more advanced that thing", "78:27", "yeah and they're cool can we see that", "78:29", "could we go there well they give us a", "78:31", "tour I bet we can I bet we could my bail", "78:33", "Apollo no I don't want to see a", "78:34", "spaceship the guy you should ask was my", "78:37", "boss when he was here yeah we're talking", "78:39", "about other shit no I you know he's got", "78:44", "the keys to the factory but but there", "78:46", "there she is on the launch pad so that", "78:49", "white stuff at the top mmm on the", "78:51", "capsule itself that's kind of like the", "78:53", "same material as the as the time has the", "78:58", "tiles but the heat shown on the bottom", "78:59", "is called pica phenolic impregnated", "79:03", "carbon ablator", "79:04", "so it's a different it's a different", "79:06", "very high-tech material that is really", "79:11", "really good at withstanding tremendous", "79:12", "amounts of heat that heat shield is way", "79:13", "oversized you could use that thing at", "79:16", "least 10 times and it really was", "79:19", "originally designed for actually entries", "79:20", "coming back from the moon when you go in", "79:22", "much faster and you hit you build up a", "79:24", "lot more heat when you hit the", "79:25", "atmosphere I think just coming back from", "79:26", "the space station so ultimately that's", "79:28", "the goal for these things to take people", "79:31", "to the moon to take people to Mars to", "79:32", "take people well and reusable right this", "79:35", "is just a start so reusability is key", "79:37", "and there's elements of this vehicle", "79:39", "that are not reusable that trunk you see", "79:41", "the thing", "79:41", "cylinder below the capsule is not", "79:43", "reusable we throw that away that the", "79:46", "second stage on the Falcon 9 we throw", "79:47", "away and you know Elon hates that with", "79:51", "that the Holy Grail is 100% reusable but", "79:55", "affordable reusability where you don't", "79:57", "have to spend like a gazillion dollars", "79:58", "refurbishing it in between flights", "80:00", "mm-hmm and we're getting there in the", "80:02", "next vehicle is going to be the real", "80:04", "that's gonna be the real hopefully we", "80:06", "will we will get that Holy Grail with", "80:08", "this starship that that we're working on", "80:11", "now so there's a is a top-secret one", "80:13", "that you can't talk about that what it", "80:14", "does you seem hesitant well it's just", "80:17", "you know we got a lot of development", "80:19", "going on and and it's not top-secret I", "80:21", "mean Elon went down did a press", "80:24", "conference in front of it in Texas not", "80:25", "too long ago and it showed what it", "80:27", "looked like yes this is one of the tests", "80:30", "it's called star hopper so this was a", "80:33", "beginning this is a testbed to test the", "80:36", "engine to make sure that we can that's", "80:38", "fake", "80:39", "that's real that's rude that is come on", "80:41", "that is not CGI really that's the thing", "80:44", "that's the thing whoa now the real thing", "80:47", "is gonna look just like that it's it's", "80:48", "it's the a this is really testing the", "80:50", "engine and the sensors and the", "80:52", "electronics what is the jet coming out", "80:55", "of the bottom those are that's that that", "80:58", "the bottom is a is there as a raptor", "81:00", "engine it's burning liquid methane and", "81:02", "liquid oxygen and then those puffs at", "81:04", "the top are cold gas thrusters just to", "81:06", "keep it pointing the right way and so", "81:07", "that's landing now yeah my god that's", "81:10", "amazing", "81:11", "awesome that is a mate look how gently", "81:14", "it lands yeah dude that seems like", "81:17", "science fiction I know that's not", "81:20", "telling you like this thing and I know", "81:22", "that the guys up in Blue Origin - Jeff", "81:24", "Bezos company has got all kinds of", "81:25", "incredible stuff on their drawing board", "81:27", "2020 is this start but it's just a start", "81:30", "show me that again I need to see that", "81:32", "again I need to see other pictures of it", "81:34", "okay that's that I want to see that", "81:36", "thing land again that video of it", "81:38", "landing is crazy I got lucky", "81:40", "did you it's so crazy though the image", "81:46", "to see it gently come down and perfectly", "81:51", "land like look at that man that looks", "81:54", "like some war the", "81:55", "world's type shit that's in a Tom Cruise", "81:57", "movie right yeah like if they were", "81:59", "flying over earth and they were starting", "82:01", "to land my god that's amazing I remember", "82:04", "when Elin first talked about landing", "82:06", "Rockets on their tails he was like I", "82:07", "think I remember him saying yeah we want", "82:09", "to do it just like Buck Rogers so so I'm", "82:13", "working with with with Ron Moore on this", "82:17", "TV show I'm working on now Wow look at", "82:19", "that thing", "82:19", "I mean yeah it's pretty awesome I said", "82:22", "before people want to see this Jimmy", "82:23", "what is the name of the the video so", "82:26", "people listening can go 150 meters star", "82:30", "hopper test more than two million eight", "82:33", "hundred thousand seven hundred thousand", "82:36", "views that's amazing man two million", "82:39", "eight hundred ninety-eight Wow it's on", "82:42", "the SpaceX page so you can go and check", "82:44", "that out so that's next stage that's net", "82:47", "stakes so there's gonna be a rocket and", "82:50", "then that that thing is gonna sit on top", "82:52", "of it or something like that thing and", "82:54", "then we're gonna get both back the", "82:55", "rocket will land on its tail and then", "82:57", "the same after it goes off to the moon", "82:59", "or even Mars it'll come back and also", "83:01", "land on his tail and then we'll get both", "83:02", "pieces will get 100% back Wow", "83:05", "and then we really got reusability guy", "83:06", "and hopefully we'll be able to use these", "83:09", "one like a hundred times at least now is", "83:11", "there any innovation or any", "83:14", "breakthroughs in fuel and in the type of", "83:17", "propulsion systems that you need me no", "83:19", "dude conceivably is there ever gonna be", "83:22", "a time where we have like a like a Star", "83:24", "Wars ex fighter that can just go shoot", "83:26", "off onto its own you know there's", "83:29", "there's a potential for more advanced", "83:31", "more efficient thrust engines and", "83:33", "probably one of the most promising ones", "83:35", "in the near-term is actually a nuclear", "83:36", "engine a nuclear thermal rocket where", "83:38", "you instead of using combustion to", "83:40", "propel hot gasses out the back of your", "83:43", "nozzle you have to use a nuclear reactor", "83:45", "and you take hydrogen you flow it over", "83:47", "that you heat it up like super hot and", "83:49", "shoot it out the back without lighting", "83:50", "it on fire and if you do that you can", "83:53", "actually get much more thrust at with", "83:55", "much less mass of fuel like a smaller", "83:57", "fuel tank but more thrust over time so", "84:02", "that's one possible way to go so it's", "84:04", "conceivable that one day there could be", "84:06", "a standalone unit that does", "84:07", "need thrusters that eject oh it still", "84:12", "would look like a regular rocket because", "84:14", "the back of the head of the nozzle would", "84:15", "still have like fire coming out the back", "84:16", "but it would just be superheated instead", "84:18", "of letting him and fire to heat it up", "84:20", "you would you would there you go there", "84:22", "we go here nuclear propulsion ntp yeah", "84:26", "nuclear thermal propulsion so the top", "84:28", "one is traditional and the second one's", "84:30", "the nuclear one Wow", "84:32", "yeah that's so it's yeah so alright so", "84:36", "there there it is that's the hydrogen", "84:37", "coming in and flowing over the reactor", "84:39", "instead of having liquid oxygen and", "84:41", "liquid hydrogen then you just all you", "84:43", "need is the liquid hydrogen's Wow so", "84:46", "that's one way but in a short term the", "84:48", "advanced you're sitting there with that", "84:50", "star hopper is that it's still a", "84:53", "traditional chemical propulsion rocket", "84:56", "so it's got fuel and oxidizer which is", "84:59", "liquid oxygen because no oxygen up there", "85:02", "to have fire you need the pyramid right", "85:03", "so you need the oxygen and that fuel and", "85:05", "the spark and you have to bring your own", "85:09", "oxygen if you're in space because you", "85:10", "can't use there you don't have that much", "85:12", "for anymore", "85:13", "so to carry liquid oxygen and some fuel", "85:16", "and in the Falcon 9 for example it's", "85:18", "basically kerosene it's rocket fuel but", "85:20", "it's our p1 but it's basically kerosene", "85:22", "mix what looks like liquid oxygen the", "85:25", "engine you saw in that star hopper is", "85:27", "advanced and different because what it", "85:30", "uses it still uses liquid oxygen but", "85:32", "instead of kerosene it uses liquid", "85:34", "methane and it's actually not as", "85:36", "efficient quite it doesn't have it quite", "85:38", "that the specific impulse which is a", "85:40", "measure of efficiency it doesn't have", "85:41", "that quite as good as hydrogen it's", "85:43", "better than kerosene but not quite as", "85:45", "good as hydrogen but here's a thing you", "85:47", "can make it on Mars and that's why we're", "85:51", "that's why he lands bill in that engine", "85:52", "because you can go to Mars and you don't", "85:54", "have to bring your gas to come home oh", "85:57", "oh so that was the big knock on going to", "86:00", "Mars for the longest time was that you'd", "86:01", "never be able to return you have to you", "86:04", "have to wait two years for the", "86:05", "trajectory for the plans to come back", "86:07", "around so you have a window that come", "86:08", "home so you do it to stay a while but", "86:10", "that the beautiful thing is if you can", "86:12", "go someplace and gas up again fill up", "86:15", "your tank without having to bring all", "86:16", "the gas with you that's huge right you", "86:20", "can you can be so much you can carry", "86:21", "some", "86:21", "much more that way and and that's you", "86:23", "can with a carbon dioxide that's in the", "86:25", "Martian atmosphere and the water that's", "86:27", "in the ice that's on the surface of Mars", "86:30", "you can have a reaction a process by", "86:33", "that allows you to create to take those", "86:36", "two things to make liquid methane and", "86:37", "you can have the tank of that ready to", "86:40", "go and all done robotically you can get", "86:43", "the telemetry back saying we got the gas", "86:45", "and then you go now how much are things", "86:47", "can accelerate now that you have all", "86:49", "these different companies competing", "86:50", "against each other that's what's", "86:52", "beautiful is like the pace of", "86:54", "technological changes like really going", "86:57", "exponential again just kind of like it", "86:59", "was during Apollo so we're back into", "87:00", "that really rapid that fast track we", "87:03", "kind of fell off of that for a little", "87:04", "while and the nice thing about people", "87:07", "ask me like what's the biggest", "87:08", "difference between working in SpaceX and", "87:10", "working at NASA and I would say it's", "87:12", "decision speed because well we'll make", "87:14", "up our mind quickly now the reason we", "87:17", "can do that is we got a tremendous", "87:18", "amount of agility because sometimes when", "87:20", "you make up your mind quickly you make", "87:22", "the wrong decision right yeah but if you", "87:24", "hurry up and figure out that you made", "87:26", "the wrong decision and you have the", "87:27", "agility did then say okay that was not", "87:29", "right let's try something else then it", "87:32", "works at NASA you know we had all these", "87:34", "contractors and suppliers and and a very", "87:37", "cumbersome kind of system that we took a", "87:40", "long time to make sure we made the right", "87:42", "decision because changing things was", "87:44", "prohibitively costly mm-hmm but SpaceX", "87:47", "doesn't have to worry about that oh now", "87:49", "what is the difference between the way", "87:51", "SpaceX is handling it you said Boeing", "87:53", "has something what did they call it", "87:55", "again so nASA has Commercial Crew", "87:57", "program and they selected to commercial", "88:00", "companies to partner with SpaceX and", "88:01", "Boeing and so's Boeing is using you know", "88:04", "an older", "88:05", "rocket that's been around a long time", "88:06", "called the Atlas 5 and they built a", "88:09", "capsule to go on top of that called the", "88:10", "Starliner and so this is strictly for", "88:13", "commercial flights well it mean it's for", "88:17", "its that that the anchor tenant if you", "88:20", "will that the core customer is still", "88:21", "NASA because NASA is going to use both", "88:23", "of these rockets to replace the Space", "88:24", "Shuttle and we won't have to beg the", "88:26", "Russians for rides anymore hmm let me", "88:28", "see what the Boeing one looks like", "88:30", "what's the name of it again a star liner", "88:32", "or used to be called the cst-100", "88:35", "let me see what this sucker looks at", "88:37", "least call it the POS 100 there's", "88:38", "Network meeting but it's a good ride", "88:42", "it's a good vehicle okay so it's kind of", "88:44", "similar in its design a little bit it's", "88:48", "doing it look well looks pretty dope", "88:49", "yeah one key difference is it lands we", "88:53", "splashed down in the water and this one", "88:55", "lands on land with those air bags", "88:57", "oh wow fuck that yeah what if those bags", "89:02", "don't work this was it is it fill up", "89:05", "like the way they use Rovers on Mars", "89:07", "where it's surrounded by these gigantic", "89:09", "air bags and it bounces when it hits the", "89:10", "ground it doesn't bounce because that's", "89:13", "not good for people robots don't mind", "89:15", "but if you bounce like that you're gonna", "89:17", "be really upset so it just hits and kind", "89:20", "of like airbags that deploy in a car and", "89:21", "they deflate and then you're done and so", "89:23", "this is on the same sort of timeline as", "89:26", "the SpaceX ship yeah I think they're", "89:28", "there I think SpaceX aspects is really", "89:32", "ready to go like in March like very soon", "89:36", "but I think we're gonna wait a little", "89:37", "longer because they're talking about", "89:38", "extending the mission for Bob and Doug", "89:40", "and keeping them on the space station so", "89:42", "they need more training sorry Bob alone", "89:44", "yeah well they get they get to hang out", "89:46", "in space for a while I'm not - I don't", "89:47", "feel too bad for them and their", "89:49", "equipment is keeping them from losing", "89:50", "all the bone density and muscle and", "89:52", "everything yeah they'll be fine now when", "89:55", "does Elon go to space oh wow I mean how", "89:58", "well do you have to have the system", "90:00", "working before you put the boss in the", "90:01", "capsule shoot him often in the heavens", "90:03", "he's got a lot of work to do here so I", "90:05", "don't think he's going to anytime soon", "90:07", "but he does eventually when when we get", "90:11", "this up and running he does eventually", "90:12", "want to go he talks about he wants to", "90:14", "die a Mars just not a tactful you know", "90:16", "that the that jokey cos so that's that's", "90:20", "you know he's serious about that he", "90:22", "really does want to die on Mars like", "90:24", "really old he wants to go and live the", "90:26", "rest of his days as part of a permanent", "90:28", "Martian colony Oh", "90:30", "Elon I got to talk to you about this but", "90:33", "he's not going to tell us you always", "90:34", "thought that way yeah that's always been", "90:36", "the plants always been a play maybe we", "90:37", "can get him high again", "90:40", "seems like it's our boy yeah well he's", "90:43", "gonna wait he's not gonna be the first", "90:44", "one he's gonna wait until we have like", "90:46", "pieces", "90:46", "and some catchy no and like in a decent", "90:50", "hotel and so the concept is terraforming", "90:53", "right that is that's not gonna happen I", "90:56", "think even Elon would tell you that's", "90:58", "not gonna happen in his lifetime that's", "90:59", "something that like generations from now", "91:01", "we could think about it's that's that's", "91:03", "hard so there's some sort of domed", "91:06", "civilization like what yeah yeah live in", "91:09", "some kind of pressurized compartment", "91:13", "some kind of pressurized habitat so it", "91:16", "it'd be kind of like science fiction", "91:19", "like what you see in science fiction", "91:21", "things where it's land on planets and", "91:24", "people live inside the ships and you", "91:26", "can't go outside unless you wear a suit", "91:28", "let's wear a suit yeah Wow", "91:30", "but hopefully there'll be plenty of", "91:32", "plenty of room inside if once this thing", "91:34", "grows to be really big we also have to", "91:38", "make sure it's really really well", "91:39", "protected from radiation because even", "91:40", "once you're on Mars you have to worry", "91:41", "about those GC ARS and yeah yeah didn't", "91:44", "he have an idea to like nuke the caps", "91:46", "yeah like nuke the Solar polar caps and", "91:49", "yeah you know it's not like anybody's", "91:51", "really sitting around drawing up plans", "91:53", "for that that was kind of like like if", "91:55", "we had to do it how could we do it", "91:57", "that's one thing you know that came off", "91:58", "the top of his head but what was that", "92:00", "that was to raise the temperature or the", "92:01", "change the atmosphere or that's the like", "92:04", "melt the captain and eject a lot of gas", "92:07", "into the atmosphere and beef up the", "92:09", "Martian atmosphere what a weird roll the", "92:12", "dice that would be and I think we're", "92:13", "gonna be trying that easy and then what", "92:18", "is the concept like in terms of", "92:19", "terraforming what kind of window of time", "92:22", "would it take to turn that into a", "92:23", "livable environment that you're starting", "92:26", "to really extrapolate it out pretty far", "92:29", "and I'd be pretty hard for me to give", "92:30", "you it so there's like giant leaps of", "92:33", "technology that have to take yeah that's", "92:34", "that's a big one but it's as a proof of", "92:36", "concept it's it's sort of I mean there", "92:39", "is a theory right the young can alter", "92:42", "the atmosphere and I mean Mars has got", "92:45", "enough gravity that if you could put", "92:46", "enough gas into the atmosphere it would", "92:48", "stick around mmm kind of like you know", "92:52", "it's it's got its possible you're not", "92:55", "going to get to one atmosphere pressure", "92:57", "like 14.7 PSI like we enjoy here", "93:00", "might be enough now and there their", "93:03", "gravity is what percentage of Earth's", "93:05", "it's about third third Wow so you you", "93:12", "would definitely experience a lot of the", "93:13", "same issues that you have if you go to", "93:15", "the Space Station so if you wanted to go", "93:18", "from Mars back to Earth it would", "93:20", "definitely be some sort of an adjustment", "93:21", "period yeah you know the really", "93:24", "interesting thing is like we know we", "93:26", "have a lot of data we know what happens", "93:28", "at in zero-g", "93:30", "because we have a lot of us have been up", "93:31", "to the space station and Skylab and", "93:34", "mirror and all that and we have tons of", "93:37", "data at 1g because all of us every day", "93:39", "live in 1g we don't really have any data", "93:42", "in between mm-hmm", "93:44", "so the question is is a half a G half as", "93:46", "good or maybe it's like 80% is good", "93:49", "Brian", "93:50", "and and and so is it linear or is it", "93:52", "nonlinear we don't know mm-hmm", "93:54", "and that's why if we send people and we", "93:57", "live on the moon or we go to Mars when", "93:59", "we live on Mars and we have data a kind", "94:01", "of moon it's about a sixth of the", "94:03", "Earth's gravity", "94:04", "so we'll get points in between and then", "94:07", "we can figure out if this thing is", "94:08", "there's a lot of stuff that happens to", "94:10", "you that may be completely solved but", "94:13", "even just a smallest amount of G hmm but", "94:16", "we don't know well that's interesting", "94:18", "right we don't know yeah because zero", "94:21", "G's an issue we don't know how much of", "94:23", "an issue", "94:24", "1/3 G is yeah now what about food like", "94:27", "what are they gonna do with food on Mars", "94:29", "are they gonna have to fly all the", "94:31", "ingredients out everything out would you", "94:34", "start talking about missions that are", "94:35", "that long carrying all your food with", "94:37", "you bringing it all becomes mass", "94:39", "prohibitive you know you just gotta take", "94:42", "so much and that just means you need", "94:44", "that that much bigger of a rocket and", "94:46", "it's just after a while it gets you know", "94:48", "to the point where it doesn't work", "94:49", "what's all the food for the rest of your", "94:51", "life essentially yeah so we're probably", "94:54", "if we're talking about like living for a", "94:56", "long time on Mars or even deep space", "94:58", "missions we gotta grow food so probably", "95:02", "plants hydroponically like the Matt", "95:04", "Damon movie yeah yeah", "95:06", "how realistic was that you know that", "95:08", "movie is really pretty good good movie", "95:10", "yeah there was a I met the author the", "95:13", "guy that wrote anyway", "95:14", "the guy that wrote the book and I told", "95:16", "him that I really didn't like his book", "95:20", "[Laughter]", "95:21", "yeah he's like why was it because like", "95:25", "there's not really enough dynamic", "95:27", "pressure in a Martian windstorm to knock", "95:29", "the antenna off the roof like now it's", "95:31", "fine with that", "95:31", "said it was because we don't have enough", "95:34", "redundancy in the comm system and that's", "95:35", "not really realistic I'm like that no", "95:37", "because well why didn't you like it I'm", "95:39", "like well listen I have a long day of", "95:40", "work at SpaceX I come home I open up the", "95:43", "book before I go to bed and I'm reading", "95:45", "this like okay I got 62 Souls and I got", "95:48", "to cover 3000 kilometres and I've got 52", "95:52", "moles of nitrogen hydroxide blah blah", "95:55", "blah and I'm like it's like I'm still at", "95:58", "work like I wanted some escapism I want", "96:03", "to like go home really have romance now", "96:04", "or something well that's not his fault", "96:06", "though no well so you just busted his", "96:09", "paw busting his balls yeah that's it's", "96:11", "interesting though that he got it close", "96:14", "yeah yeah he did a great job that's all", "96:16", "true I mean for something does he have a", "96:18", "background in that yeah I think he does", "96:20", "uh I hear something okay that makes more", "96:22", "sense yeah yeah but what that movie was", "96:26", "terrifying", "96:27", "the idea that you can get stuck up yeah", "96:29", "the only part of the movie which I don't", "96:31", "think was in the book that was not", "96:33", "realistic at all was when he cuts his", "96:34", "glove and does the Iron Man Thing uh-oh", "96:37", "usually flying back to the spaceship you", "96:39", "can't really control it that he would", "96:42", "spin out of control it's yes you'd also", "96:45", "need a big hole to really get enough", "96:46", "propulsion and then your suit would", "96:48", "deflate I mean it's just that's just not", "96:50", "gonna work yeah and how long would you", "96:51", "survive out there with no suit that's a", "96:55", "good question just holding your breath", "96:58", "just well you can't really hold your", "97:01", "breath because as the as a pressure all", "97:02", "goes down the first thing you have to", "97:04", "worry about is Barrow trauma so like in", "97:06", "your lungs and in your sinuses and", "97:08", "you're it's all gonna like like an", "97:10", "overinflated balloon so if you try to", "97:12", "hold your breath that's a wrong thing to", "97:14", "do cuz you go so you have to let the", "97:17", "breath out yeah you can't really do that", "97:20", "for very long though like the way people", "97:21", "hold their breath underwater they", "97:23", "actually have breath in their lungs yeah", "97:25", "but they're not equalizing what the", "97:27", "pressure as a", "97:28", "go down you know when they do those like", "97:29", "freediving that's right", "97:31", "so if you're gonna equalize you're gonna", "97:35", "have to let the air out or it's going to", "97:37", "just expand and and be extremely painful", "97:41", "and and hurt you so you could do that", "97:44", "but then eventually you get to the point", "97:46", "where the pressure gets so low that the", "97:48", "all the liquid in your tissues starts", "97:50", "turning into gas that's called a Buell", "97:52", "ism and then you'll start getting this", "97:55", "massive swelling like your nickel for a", "97:58", "puff up like that and everything you'll", "98:01", "get grotesque swelling and wherever that", "98:03", "your blood is turning to gas and OH", "98:06", "although all the liquids and your", "98:08", "tissues are turning into gases it's not", "98:10", "a good thing how long will that take", "98:11", "before that starts happening that will", "98:13", "start happening fairly quickly when you", "98:15", "equalize after you breathe out all that", "98:17", "air you can counteract it by having", "98:20", "squeezed suits like Scouten suits with", "98:22", "mechanical counter pressure that squeeze", "98:23", "it and hold it in like a blood pressure", "98:25", "cuff kind of pressure Oh kind of thing", "98:29", "so you could do that that's um promising", "98:33", "no no you know there's there's ways you", "98:37", "can you can live through it but it is", "98:39", "we've had this happen to people in", "98:41", "vacuum chambers accidents like", "98:43", "industrial vacuum chambers and one test", "98:46", "chamber and NASA once had an accident", "98:48", "and we've momentarily subjected people", "98:51", "too close to space vacuum but very", "98:54", "quickly got him back to pressure and", "98:55", "they were okay mmm", "98:57", "so all the bubbles just kind of like", "98:58", "yeah", "99:01", "now what is the timeline in terms of", "99:04", "like does SpaceX have a multiple stage", "99:08", "timeline like a timeline for", "99:10", "incorporating the dragon crew and then a", "99:12", "timeline for the star hopper and then a", "99:15", "timeline for additional projects in the", "99:17", "future like as is he thinking along", "99:20", "these lines of like a like charted out", "99:24", "progress oh yeah yeah he's in fact he", "99:27", "measures pretty much every major", "99:29", "decision by whether or not it brings the", "99:31", "day when we have a self-sustainable", "99:34", "colony on Mars sooner or later", "99:37", "that's the prism by which he makes every", "99:39", "like every single decision he makes", "99:41", "through that prism Jesus yeah so he's", "99:45", "got an idea and he'll keep pushing and", "99:47", "you know he gives us aggressive", "99:48", "timelines that we have to work to and we", "99:50", "work really hard to try to try to meet", "99:52", "him it's hard when you're doing stuff", "99:54", "that this does this complicate it to", "99:55", "predict exactly how long it's going to", "99:57", "take so you know we end up off and", "99:59", "falling a little bit behind but we do", "100:01", "our best that's the case though with", "100:03", "everything that's that crazy right yeah", "100:05", "I mean no I mean especially Elon he's", "100:07", "never right in his predictions all wacky", "100:09", "inventions they're always a little off", "100:11", "you know but we think but but he's so", "100:14", "driven you know and he's such a smart", "100:15", "guy and and he's he's the most he's", "100:20", "really the most driven person I think", "100:22", "I've ever met", "100:23", "I'll give you a story that kind of", "100:25", "Illustrated once when I first got hired", "100:29", "by SpaceX we did a interview with 60", "100:31", "minutes and they interviewed at Elon and", "100:34", "myself and Scott Pelley was the any", "100:38", "anchor he'd talked to us and he said to", "100:41", "me why did you leave NASA and come work", "100:44", "for SpaceX he had like the best gig in a", "100:46", "world you know going up on rockets and", "100:48", "stuff why would you do that and I said", "100:51", "well if you can go back in time and you", "100:53", "were a young engineer and you had the", "100:54", "opportunity to like get in on the ground", "100:56", "floor and work with Howard Hughes when", "100:58", "he was like doing all the crazy stuff he", "101:00", "was doing and in his day wouldn't you", "101:02", "want to be a part of that Scott Pelley", "101:04", "looked at me like with a deer in the", "101:06", "headlights so cuz I don't think he know", "101:08", "what I was talking about but I was like", "101:10", "that's it but then I realized this as I", "101:11", "say that like oh my god I just made a", "101:14", "terrible strategic error I compared my", "101:17", "boss to Howard Hughes and you know", "101:19", "things didn't end up that well for", "101:20", "Howard you know he went crazy right and", "101:23", "went kind of crazy became washed his", "101:24", "hands too much and germaphobe he was", "101:27", "peeing in jars and like his fingernails", "101:29", "grew out like hmm yeah and I was like", "101:33", "god no I really kind of stepped in it",

"Factory and and he his uh what's really", "105:30", "remarkable to me is is is the breadth of", "105:32", "his knowledge", "105:32", "I mean I've met a lot of super super", "105:34", "smart people but they're usually super", "105:36", "super smart on one thing and he's able", "105:39", "to have conversations with our top", "105:40", "engineers about the software and you", "105:44", "know the

know I mean I'm", "106:30", "very happy exists you know yeah but it's", "106:34", "very confusing to me I just feel so", "106:36", "stupid when I'm around him the", "106:41", "conversations I've had with him like", "106:42", "goddamn I'm dumb yeah do what you got to", "106:46", "do with what you got I would go that far", "106:50", "so his uh his ultimate goal is to create", "106:56", "some sort of a colony on Mars but he", "106:58", "believes that this technology will", "107:00", "continue to expand to the point where we", "107:02", "will be leaving our solar system we will", "107:05", "be making human trips into other solar", "107:10", "systems into actual deep space yeah I", "107:12", "mean certainly hopefully that's you know", "107:14", "at some point if we're going to survive", "107:17", "you take the really long view you know", "107:19", "the solar system is not gonna last", "107:20", "forever right it's gonna last plenty", "107:22", "long and if my kids are listening at", "107:24", "home", "107:24", "don't worry freaking out right now no we", "107:29", "got plenty of time couple billion years", "107:31", "kids relax it's not in our lifetime", "107:34", "they're so funny but uh but eventually", "107:37", "we're gonna have to find a new home if", "107:39", "we're gonna last forever", "107:40", "mmm and we all hope that we last forever", "107:42", "as a species right so at least most of", "107:45", "us do so eventually we got to get there", "107:48", "but we got plenty of time in a short", "107:50", "term the important thing is at least", "107:52", "getting out so not in just one place in", "107:54", "the solar system because this you know", "107:57", "something bad could happen to this", "107:59", "planet sure we've got no backup right", "108:01", "and

well what we need is", "108:19", "someone like Elon who concentrates on", "108:21", "the solutions I mean he's obviously got", "108:23", "a full plate yet many full plates but", "108:27", "someone like him to concentrate on", "108:29", "solutions to some of", "108:30", "environmental problems that we've", "108:31", "created for ourselves here well that's", "108:33", "really that's that was the thought", "108:34", "behind Tesla I mean so so Tesla's kind", "108:37", "of like plan a he saved this planet and", "108:39", "SpaceX was kind of Plan B if you look at", "108:41", "it that way it's just so weird to have a", "108:44", "guy like that amongst us you know", "108:46", "especially have him as your boss have", "108:50", "you talked to him at all about", "108:51", "simulation theory we never thing is what", "108:54", "every time I talk to him we focused on", "108:56", "and this is what he does you know he", "108:58", "focuses on the thing that we are working", "109:00", "on mm-hmm so he just that's one of the", "109:03", "ways he does his time management that's", "109:05", "one of the ways he's able to do all", "109:07", "these things it's like he doesn't sit", "109:08", "around and and and and and BS with you", "109:11", "about like what's going on with was a", "109:15", "neuro-link the company was making the", "109:17", "chips at going oh that's right I forgot", "109:18", "about that that's the other thing he", "109:19", "does that one he doesn't in the way", "109:20", "humans interface with data he never said", "109:22", "to me like Garret what do you think", "109:23", "about having a chip in your head that", "109:24", "like never he doesn't do that he talks", "109:27", "to the people who really know about", "109:28", "chips and people and putting chips in", "109:30", "people's head he talks to them about it", "109:31", "so you're gonna sign up for that no face", "109:39", "expression you made like no my website", "109:46", "got hacked and it freaked me out of how", "109:49", "well they're gonna put wires in your", "109:52", "head yeah right that's the idea behind", "109:54", "it idea Christ he's probably gonna be", "109:59", "inevitable it once it happens I mean I", "110:01", "don't want to be an early adopter but", "110:03", "once it does happen and it really does", "110:07", "remarkably increase your your ability to", "110:10", "interface with data is that's the idea", "110:12", "right it said it ramps up the bandwidth", "110:14", "in which people can access ideas and", "110:17", "information it's gonna change the way we", "110:19", "interface yeah I mean I could see it", "110:21", "being kind of an extreme haves and", "110:24", "have-nots situation like you think wow", "110:25", "how far behind you are today how left", "110:28", "behind you are if you have no internet", "110:29", "access right and this will be kind of", "110:32", "this could be like another level of that", "110:34", "yeah I'm worried I'm worried about that", "110:36", "yeah I got other things that keep me up", "110:38", "at night I got yeah I mean what is it", "110:41", "going crazy nine-year old and it", "110:43", "real real-world problems yeah it's just", "110:46", "to me it seems like if you pay attention", "110:49", "to the track if you track technology", "110:52", "look where it's going things constantly", "110:54", "improve they constantly we demand", "110:57", "constant innovation and we're already", "111:00", "wearing these things on our body and", "111:02", "watches now a lot of people were in the", "111:04", "Apple watches and the Samsung and all", "111:06", "the Google watches and it just seems", "111:08", "inevitable that it somehow or another", "111:10", "advances to a point where there's a chip", "111:13", "or something you wear or some plate that", "111:17", "they put in the back your head and screw", "111:18", "in yeah but then you watch like black", "111:21", "mirror and it is the problem in that be", "111:24", "good I mean but do you have a sense of", "111:28", "history that you are first of all you're", "111:31", "amongst one of the rare human beings", "111:33", "that has ever been in space and then to", "111:35", "you're working for a company that is at", "111:39", "the very tip of the spear of innovation", "111:43", "like the you are you're at the front of", "111:45", "the line in terms of creating viable", "111:48", "methods of sending people into space and", "111:52", "returning them I feel extremely", "111:54", "fortunate you know eight to have that", "111:56", "experience I had at NASA and had the", "111:59", "visceral experience the incredible", "112:01", "experience of flying in space doing", "112:04", "spacewalks operating robot arm is", "112:05", "launching on rockets and all that and", "112:07", "then coming to SpaceX and being there at", "112:10", "in the relatively early days and being", "112:12", "there for seven years I feel like you", "112:17", "know I feel pretty satisfied I got to", "112:19", "see I got incredibly lucky to see these", "112:21", "things and be in the room where it", "112:24", "happens you know it's it's pretty", "112:27", "remarkable and now so now I'm a now I'm", "112:30", "still a consultant of SpaceX but I'm a", "112:32", "full-time professor at USC so now I'm", "112:35", "teaching and I'm also working on TV", "112:38", "shows so now I'm like taking that those", "112:40", "incredible experiences I had opened up a", "112:42", "lot of other doors and like I ended up", "112:44", "it was like for example working and", "112:46", "working on this TV show I find myself", "112:47", "like in there in the writers room with a", "112:50", "whole bunch of really talented creative", "112:52", "people where there's no way in a million", "112:54", "years I would", "112:55", "so it ever happened to me if it weren't", "112:57", "for these incredible experiences I was", "112:59", "lucky enough to have you know it's like", "113:00", "that gets even that gets really surreal", "113:02", "I could only imagine I mean I can only", "113:05", "imagine especially coming from your", "113:07", "childhood having that image on your wall", "113:10", "and now really being a part of this", "113:12", "massive change in the way human beings", "113:16", "are going to be able to travel in space", "113:17", "yeah now what is tell us about this TV", "113:20", "show because you were talking about it", "113:21", "off air before we started yeah so this", "113:23", "this is for all mankind it's on Apple TV", "113:26", "and the the way I got involved with this", "113:29", "thing I was a big fan of Battlestar", "113:32", "Galactica dead the reetou reboot was", "113:34", "awesome wasn't it oh it's oh so", "113:35", "underrated yeah when the best science", "113:38", "fiction shows ever yeah I mean it's like", "113:40", "in the early days of kind of like peak", "113:42", "TV I guess and it was like um it was", "113:45", "just so good I mean the writing was so", "113:46", "good and the whole concept and", "113:48", "everything all that all the things", "113:50", "they're exploring and the science", "113:52", "fiction is always as best when it's like", "113:53", "an allegory and the way they explored", "113:55", "things that were happening in society", "113:57", "like terrorism and stuff the way they", "114:00", "were able to depict it as in a scienter", "114:03", "alternate universe I thought it was", "114:05", "spectacular yeah it's brilliant", "114:07", "brilliant show so I'm watching it on the", "114:09", "space station which was like the best", "114:11", "what do you what using an iPad or", "114:16", "something like how do you have things", "114:17", "stored or is there a TV up there", "114:19", "there's no TV but there's we have all", "114:21", "these laptops so you could send up files", "114:23", "and you can you can give them like four", "114:24", "shows that you like how long does it", "114:26", "take for a show to download in space", "114:28", "well they download it for you which is", "114:31", "nice while you're while you're working", "114:32", "then when you're when you're ready to", "114:33", "watch you just pop up the file so is it", "114:35", "like a satellite connection internet", "114:37", "satellite it's it's kind of it's a it's", "114:40", "a kayuu band system that goes to", "114:42", "satellites that aren't part of it NASA", "114:45", "satellites are called tigress satellites", "114:46", "so the data goes up to teachers and and", "114:48", "down at ground stations to White Sands", "114:50", "and then so we're gonna ban with you", "114:52", "getting what's your latency I don't", "114:55", "remember the numbers but we weren't", "114:57", "getting when I was there we weren't", "114:59", "getting live Internet", "115:00", "because all that bandwidth is being used", "115:02", "for science to get done all the data", "115:03", "from the experiments in the video so you", "115:05", "can't tor check your Twitter you can", "115:08", "now you can now can now I just missed", "115:10", "that that's terrible", "115:12", "yes probably yeah traction yeah

"like a bit at home that you know I would", "115:43", "play the radio broadcasts while I was", "115:45", "working and just in the background and", "115:47", "so I feel like you're the crack of the", "115:49", "bat and it's kind of like you're in", "115:51", "space but you're still kind of connected", "115:52", "to home that seems like something that", "115:53", "would go on in a movie yeah some guy", "115:55", "who's working about a spaceship in the", "115:57", "movie is listening to a baseball game go", "115:59", "just yet three balls two strikes yeah", "116:01", "doesn't that yeah it

Moore and David Icke oh", "116:47", "the creators of Battlestar mm-hmm so we", "116:50", "had this great Skype session wow it's so", "116:53", "cool and that's why before I was gonna", "116:55", "mention this when we were talking about", "116:57", "you know science fiction and science", "116:59", "fact and had this is crazy feedback loop", "117:01", "about you got to think about it first", "117:04", "like you'd go back and look at 2001 and", "117:06", "you see these guys using tablets in 1960", "117:10", "was in 1968 that movie came out hmm", "117:13", "and you know Steve Jobs saw that

most popular network", "118:18", "and it's also a reboot of a classic show", "118:21", "so maybe it had like a bit of a stink to", "118:24", "it but that was so much better than the", "118:26", "first version of it it's a great fucking", "118:30", "show it's really intense yes it's really", "118:32", "really well made I like everything about", "118:35", "it from the plot to the acting it's it's",

it's", "118:55", "yeah they all kind of build on each", "118:56", "other and that's what and so there's Ron", "118:58", "went off and did Outlander after that", "118:59", "okay and now he came in one day he calls", "119:02", "me up and he says I got this new idea", "119:04", "can I come by we can together and maybe", "119:07", "I could bounce the idea off of ya and I", "119:09", "was like yeah so he came to SpaceX and I", "119:11", "gave him a tour of the place and then we", "119:13", "sat down at the in the cafe and he said", "119:16", "okay so I'm thinking about doing a show", "119:19",

around with a slight twist that", "119:37", "where we use an alternate reality and in", "119:40", "this alternate reality things we start", "119:44", "at that point but things turn out", "119:45",

they were", "120:01", "really working hard on it so we started", "120:03", "what-iffing like well what if the", "120:05", "Russians got there first what would what", "120:07", "would America done how think how would", "120:09", "things be different today if that", "120:11", "seminal moment of Neil and Buzz stepping", "120:14", "out on the moon", "120:15", "was instead of letting the owner for",

and he", "120:28", "pitched that to Apple and they bought it", "120:30", "and then he called me up and said would", "120:32", "you want to work on the show I'm like", "120:33", "yeah so what is your role what do you do", "120:36", "there I'm a technical consultant one of", "120:40", "a couple we have a we have a another", "120:42", "group of people a couple of people that", "120:44", "help out too but I get involved in like", "120:46", "everything so I was in the writers room", "120:47", "where we're first coming up with basic", "120:49", "ideas and sketching out like multiple", "120:51",

so how much correcting do", "121:54", "you have to do how much do you get the", "121:55", "script and go eh that doesn't happen", "121:57", "that you can't do that that's not it", "122:00", "depends and every production is", "122:02", "different the nice thing about for all", "122:03", "mankind is they really really want to", "122:05", "get it right I've worked on other", "122:06", "projects

pool", "122:42", "player and I can tell the guy can't", "122:43", "really play pool I get upset so for you", "122:45", "when you're watching something like", "122:48", "gravity yeah right that was a big one a", "122:50", "lot of people got really like Neil", "122:52", "deGrasse Tyson I know I hate it he hated", "122:53", "it hated it I liked it and the problem", "122:57", "is now that I have this job now I'm", "122:59", "getting more persnickety about it you", "123:01", "know I'm sure now I'm watching I'm like", "123:03", "that's not right well yeah everything", "123:05", "the gravity the hair the did not care", "123:08", "though like I when I first saw gravity I", "123:10", "loved it because it was a good story it", "123:13", "was it gripped me and but you knew that", "123:15", "those space stations were not close to", "123:17", "each other", "123:17", "oh yeah the inclinations were the orbits", "123:19", "are totally different there's no you're", "123:20", "gonna go from one to the other with a", "123:21", "fire extinguisher", "123:22", "I knew that was complete bullshit don't", "123:24", "get me wrong but that bleep were they", "123:27", "treating you like you're a moron they're", "123:29", "treating you like there's no way you're", "123:30", "gonna be able to research this but", "123:32", "something like you someone like you", "123:33", "rather that's your life so you know", "123:35", "that's nonsense so you're sitting there", "123:36", "watching some hokey solution", "123:39", "yeah for something that would never work", "123:41", "yeah so if it gets to the point where", "123:43", "like but that's a beautiful thing about", "123:45", "like doing this with televisions you", "123:48", "don't have to actually be right just", "123:49", "have to be believable which is the bar", "123:52", "is like when I'm teaching my class at", "123:53", "USC I gotta be right but when I'm like", "123:58", "yeah well maybe this could happen", "124:00", "you know with the TV show it's easier", "124:02", "but this TV show you're just saying they", "124:04", "really want to try to really do because", "124:06", "it's it's really important to them and", "124:07", "so yeah I've ended up making like", "124:10", "wholesale changes to episodes become", "124:13", "like the original idea I try very very", "124:16", "hard not to interfere with their", "124:17", "creative process because they're it's", "124:19", "really really good at that and um you", "124:22", "know I'm not worthy but I'm like yeah", "124:24", "okay I see what you're trying to do you", "124:26", "might this gotta be the hero you want", "124:28", "this person to feel remorse you want", "124:29", "this and and and over the course of time", "124:32", "this person has a change of heart I get", "124:34", "the story but what if instead of doing", "124:37", "it this way what if the events occur", "124:39", "like this because this could actually", "124:41", "happen right and somebody tried to", "124:42", "change it and there's one like like", "124:45", "episode 9 and a little bit of episode 10", "124:47", "of season 1 we ended up sitting I ended", "124:51", "up sitting and working very closely with", "124:52", "the writers and changing all the", "124:54", "technical content to fit to make the", "124:55", "story work in a believable way and that", "124:58", "when we do that and then you see it on", "125:00", "the screen it's like so incredibly", "125:02", "rewarding it's really fun that must be", "125:04", "especially as someone who's a sci-fi fan", "125:06", "like you've you've had to dream lives", "125:08", "here like I know you're four really", "125:11", "incredible that you've gone from that", "125:14", "from NASA to SpaceX and now to be able", "125:16", "to create television shows that you can", "125:18", "actually enjoy yeah Wow", "125:20", "um one things I wanted to ask you about", "125:22", "space is we always hear stuff about", "125:25", "space junk about satellites and just", "125:28", "junk that's floating around the", "125:30", "atmosphere how much of a concern is that", "125:33", "and what could be done about that stuff", "125:35", "it's a huge concern it's a very very big", "125:38", "problem in in in certain orbits around", "125:41", "the earth low Earth orbit and also at", "125:42", "the geostationary orbits that are very", "125:44", "that's where you could put like", "125:45", "communications satellites and they stay", "125:47", "over one spot of the earth those are", "125:49", "very polluted you know there's a lot of", "125:52", "junk and it is very dangerous and it's", "125:54", "it's a real problem is hard to clean up", "125:57", "over time eventually even even at higher", "126:02", "altitudes there's still a little bit of", "126:03", "atmosphere like individual atoms", "126:05", "eventually that slows you down those", "126:07", "collisions eventually slow you down so", "126:10", "eventually it comes back but it could", "126:11", "take a long long time come back to earth", "126:13", "you mean yeah", "126:14", "they'll come back and he'll burn up so", "126:16", "the most important thing is don't make", "126:17", "any more junk that's like the best thing", "126:19", "we can do and we're getting much smarter", "126:21", "they get SpaceX we take our second", "126:23", "stages and all of our NASA missions and", "126:25", "after after we it's accomplished its", "126:27", "mission we keep enough gas in the tank", "126:28", "to burn the engine one more time and", "126:30", "bring it back in one piece so it doesn't", "126:32", "blow up into smithereens and cause more", "126:34", "junk whenever we do anti-satellite test", "126:36", "though China did one relatively recently", "126:39", "and we've done them in the past those", "126:42", "are like the worst because they create", "126:43", "giant clouds of junk and and we have to", "126:47", "still we still have to live with that is", "126:49", "there any concepts on the table for how", "126:52", "to do that stuff out there's some ideas", "126:55", "of you know using lasers that lays the", "126:58", "things and and and and and make subtle", "127:01", "changes to their trajectories and orbits", "127:04", "but it's all that all the technical", "127:07", "solutions are challenging and expensive", "127:09", "so I don't know of any one idea that's", "127:11", "gonna like just solve this problem", "127:13", "easily because we've seen the map of the", "127:15", "earth and all the different satellites", "127:17", "that orbit it now and all the different", "127:18", "jump pieces of junk that have been", "127:21", "identified it's crazy yeah the amount of", "127:24", "stuff and it seems like nobody kind of", "127:26", "thought it through they just sort of did", "127:29", "it and left the junk up there and that's", "127:32", "what humans do man I mean like we've", "127:34", "been dumping stuff in the oceans forever", "127:35", "yeah and not really giving much thought", "127:37", "to it and now we're funny giant gyros of", "127:40", "plastic or them you know yeah so yeah we", "127:44", "tend to not really react until it's a", "127:46", "really big problem but it's a big", "127:48", "problem and and when I did my first", "127:50", "spacewalk one of the things we had to do", "127:52", "was we had to bring in his handle they", "127:56", "were going to use on a subsequent", "127:57", "spacewalk it was like it was we call it", "127:58", "D handle it's just basically a half-inch", "128:00", "piece of aluminum around like like this", "128:03", "that you can attach to something then", "128:05", "carry things so we had this big chunk of", "128:07", "aluminum and we brought it inside in my", "128:09", "spacewalk partner Rick looked at the", "128:11", "thing when we came inside to saw a hole", "128:13", "shot straight through it", "128:15", "it's like about a millimeter in diameter", "128:18", "it's really small but it went right", "128:19", "through this half-inch thick solid", "128:21", "aluminum and he looked at that and he", "128:24", "said man if that hit one of us", "128:27", "and he didn't have to finish that", "128:28", "statement because if this stuff is", "128:30", "moving generally speaking about 10", "128:34", "kilometers per second so that's like", "128:35", "roughly 10 times as fast as a rifle", "128:39", "bullet so something like that hits you", "128:42", "it could be a Fleck of paint hitting you", "128:43", "at that velocity in the hitch in the", "128:45", "suit you're in a hundred percent oxygen", "128:47", "environment and you're just gonna flame", "128:49", "up I mean you're gonna instantly combust", "128:51", "it's gonna be a really a bad day so he", "128:53", "didn't have to like you said you know", "128:55", "when he said that he didn't have to", "128:56", "finish it and we both looked at it and", "128:58", "then I looked at him and said yeah but", "129:02", "you're six foot four so statistically", "129:06", "it's gonna hit you more object and", "129:08", "beside that was kind of behind you most", "129:10", "of the way out there but I probably go", "129:12", "right through him and right through you", "129:13", "to hit probably him like that's what's", "129:15", "so crazy about is there's so much of", "129:16", "that stuff up there I'm always wondering", "129:18", "like why doesn't it hit the space", "129:20", "station what it does does a couple of", "129:22", "times I was inside the space station I", "129:23", "heard us take a hit whoa but just but so", "129:27", "I heard the ping but fortune I didn't", "129:28", "hear the ping fall but a change yeah so", "129:34", "that ping is probably something bouncing", "129:36", "off something or going through something", "129:37", "so the station has shielding it's called", "129:39", "whipple shielding and it's basically a", "129:41", "piece of a wall a thin piece of metal", "129:45", "that stands off from the hull so the", "129:48", "thin piece of metal is never going to", "129:49", "stop this thing but it when it hits at", "129:51", "that hyper velocity it breaks up into", "129:53", "lots of little tiny pieces and it's", "129:56", "almost like a fluid at that point it's", "129:58", "like these like it's like it like almost", "130:00", "a cloud of dust and then when it hits", "130:02", "the hull those individual pieces don't", "130:05", "penetrate hmm so it just it just", "130:07", "shatters it and that what that works", "130:09", "what if it hits that window it has hit", "130:13", "the shuttle window you know we've it has", "130:15", "multiple panes and it's really really", "130:17", "strong but we came home with big it", "130:19", "looks like like when a rockets kicked up", "130:21", "and it takes really yeah we've we've", "130:23", "seen that yeah wow that's a little scary", "130:26", "Jesus Christ a little chest", "130:29", "what about micro meteors and things", "130:32", "along those lines well depending on", "130:34", "where you are so in in Earth orbit", "130:35", "there's much more of manmade junk than", "130:39", "there", "130:39", "micrometeorites but there are those too", "130:42", "when you get out away from Earth orbit", "130:44", "like if we're gonna go back to the moon", "130:46", "then there's no more human-made junk but", "130:48", "there is those micro meteorites are", "130:50", "still out there and they can do the same", "130:51", "kind of damage but there's a lot fewer", "130:53", "of them the density of those things is a", "130:56", "lot less than what you experience so", "130:58", "it's if you go to Mars I'd worry about", "131:01", "the radiation first and then the micro", "131:02", "meteoroids I like down the list it just", "131:04", "seems to so many things to think about", "131:06", "yeah and is this all factored into your", "131:10", "television show uh well a lot of these", "131:15", "things are I can't can't say I can't", "131:18", "give any spoilers but Susan one is", "131:19", "available right now it is all we can", "131:20", "talk about that but season two I am NOT", "131:23", "allowed to give any spoilers or anything", "131:25", "but I can tell you this like yeah", "131:26", "there's some of these concepts end up in", "131:28", "there yeah well listen it's been a real",
