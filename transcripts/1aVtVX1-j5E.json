whether or", "121:57", "not this really works because apparently", "122:00", "your body is supposed to emit some sort", "122:02", "of electric electrical signal and if you", "122:05", "run your body

hex", "122:35", "suit on they've shown the difference", "122:36", "between wearing it and not wearing it", "122:38", "and it seems to Allah see this I'm not", "122:40", "impressed with because he's about to", "122:42", "shoot this animal that animal can't see", "122:43", "him", "122:44", "anybody could do that I could do that", "122:45", "with like clothes on if the animal can't", "122:47",

to somehow another protect you", "122:55", "they shouldn't have shown that one", "122:57", "because that video didn't mean anything", "122:59", "it's like you couldn't see that the", "123:01", "animal was looking his way it was", "123:03", "interesting though see it shows like go", "123:06", "back a little bit so watch it shows when", "123:09", "they walk in front no you just had its", "123:11", "leave it alone go back", "123:13", "they're kind of sure okay man watch see", "123:16", "he's passing in front of it and without", "123:18", "hacks you see how it registers now with", "123:21", "the hex Sudan it registers very little", "123:23", "again this is somehow or another", "123:25", "supposed to be read recognising the", "123:28", "electrical signal that your body has", "123:30", "they so

works", "123:59", "with coyotes - that's the weird one", "124:00", "coyotes like walk right up to people", "124:02", "that are wearing it the idea is that", "124:04", "animals might have certain senses and", "124:06", "ability to detect signals that you give", "124:09", "off that we just don't possess so", "124:11", "because we don't possess those those", "124:13", "abilities to recognize

study on it", "124:50", "do they have Studies on this like do", "124:52", "that when you go up there when it says", "124:54", "proof do they have a proof thing if you", "124:56", "go to the top I would like how it works", "124:58", "yeah how does it work there's no like oh", "125:02", "yeah", "125:04", "see I feel like hex blocks the", "125:06", "electrical signal okay seems to block", "125:09", "that the real question to me is do the", "125:13", "animals see it yeah they've done a", "125:15", "extensive extensive Studies on what", "125:17", "animals do and don't see as far as", "125:20", "camouflage and I think one of the ways", "125:22", "they've done that and what kind of light", "125:23", "they see one of the way they've done", "125:25", "that is through like they have like dear", "125:27", "far", "125:27", "so they have undulates in captivity and", "125:29", "they feed them and they only feed them", "125:31", "if they can see certain things so they", "125:34",
