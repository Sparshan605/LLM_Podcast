live in a computer man", "49:08", "it's interesting that's that's", "49:10", "fascinating to me i think the reason why", "49:12", "they say that is because", "49:13", "one day we will and we all know it we", "49:16", "all know it", "49:17", "we all know that one day you could be in", "49:20", "something that's as ridiculous as what", "49:21", "you're experiencing right now and it", "49:22", "could

there's still still there's", "50:15", "evidence no no for sure but there's", "50:16", "evidence right i'm not saying but", "50:18", "whether it's true or not i'm just saying", "50:19", "yeah i don't want to go into a 911", "50:21", "inside job conversation i'm just saying", "50:24", "i'm just using that i'm just using that", "50:26", "as an example like as a that's a crazy", "50:29", "conspiracy theory", "50:30", "but there's a lot of evidence whether", "50:31", "it's true or not who knows you know what", "50:33", "i mean", "50:34", "um i think it was an inside job but a", "50:36", "lot of people don't and whatever", "50:37", "but there's zero evidence of us living", "50:40", "in a computer science but we're not", "50:42", "talking about the same people", "50:43", "they might not be the same people that", "50:44", "believe one or the other they're", "50:46", "different lumping them together no no no", "50:47", "no i'm not", "50:48", "there they're different people i mean i", "50:50",

people that believe winners", "50:57", "you're right i haven't there's no poll", "50:59", "on it i haven't taken a poll i know i'm", "51:01", "just", "51:01", "connecting it to 9-1-1 you just went you", "51:03", "wanted to talk about it so you got us", "51:05", "into it", "51:06", "that's that's yeah we don't want to talk", "51:07", "about 911 i was just using that", "51:09", "as an example i know what you're saying", "51:10", "you know people believe weird shit they", "51:12", "definitely do like", "51:13", "like the people that really want to", "51:14", "believe in bigfoot or the people that", "51:16", "really want to believe in ufos like ufos", "51:18", "are coming back right now everybody's", "51:19", "talking they're stronger than ever", "51:20", "bigger than stronger than ever

was he got", "59:34", "balls deep into that he started getting", "59:36", "into", "59:36", "breaking down what's really happening", "59:38", "with ufos he's going oh shit", "59:41", "we're being pl we're the government is", "59:43", "pretending to cover it up", "59:44", "there they want to push it they want", "59:47", "people to believe in aliens so what do", "59:48", "you think that the cattle

the", "61:32", "forbidden place take a", "61:34", "picture of it or something like that and", "61:35", "then go back home well they busted", "61:37", "people because", "61:38", "they like park rangers

don't care", "92:32", "it's about 6 000 feet it's about 6 000", "92:34", "feet of curvature", "92:35", "so you should not be able to see where", "92:37", "you can see no you wouldn't be able to",

should be six", "92:52", "thousand feet of curvature", "92:54", "do you don't even understand what that", "92:55", "means i don't i understand what that", "92:56", "means if we live on a ball that at", "92:58", "every hundred miles there should be six", "93:00", "thousand feet of curvature there's", "93:02", "there's a formula for it and but when", "93:04", "you look", "93:05", "uh there's uh
