["00:00", "dr. Hotez how are you sir oh it's great", "00:03", "to see you again Joe oh he's I feel a", "00:05", "lot better seeing you now I feel a lot", "00:07", "better seeing you too especially with", "00:08", "the bowtie as we talked about before", "00:10", "your signature touch yes I was saying", "00:13", "and I try to start wearing a regular tie", "00:15", "for a while it was like when Dylan", "00:18", "started switching to electric", "00:19", "instruments the Newport Folk Festival", "00:21", "and there were just cries of outrage so", "00:23", "I had to", "00:24", "what kind of cries of outrage are you", "00:26", "getting about your bow tie especially in", "00:27", "these trying not a like the bow tie at", "00:29", "the fight the fight the point was I", "00:31", "tried to switch to regular tie for a", "00:32", "wire and they said that there's no way", "00:34", "that can happen yeah that's what I meant", "00:36", "I screwed it up but I meant like what", "00:37", "kind of who's getting upset are you", "00:38", "wearing a regular time to get a life I", "00:41", "think it was venting in a good-natured", "00:45", "way I'm sure so we don't do very many", "00:47", "these Skype ones but because they're odd", "00:50", "so let's I don't know if you've done too", "00:53", "many of these that sometimes people talk", "00:55", "over each other it's it's very strange", "00:57", "yeah I guess it's the it's the epidemic", "01:00", "right otherwise I'd be on a plane and", "01:02", "come to see you in LA and yeah we'll do", "01:05", "that again sometime you know let's let's", "01:07", "get going", "01:08", "so taking it from the top let's let's", "01:11", "discuss give us your take on how we got", "01:14", "here", "01:15", "because this is it's been very strange", "01:17", "obviously the president completely", "01:21", "miscalculated what was going to happen", "01:23", "in the way he was explaining it to the", "01:25", "news he was kind of saying that it was", "01:26", "just a few cases and they'll be gone", "01:28", "and now obviously New York City shut", "01:30", "down the entire country is separated", "01:33", "from each other", "01:34", "everybody is isolating at home give us", "01:36", "your take on how we got here well you", "01:39", "know the truth is we knew this was", "01:42", "coming or something like it we had a", "01:44", "heads up and and and even a even a heads", "01:46", "up before last year because this is now", "01:49", "our third major coronavirus disaster of", "01:53", "the 21st century we had what's called", "01:55", "SAR severe acute respiratory syndrome in", "01:58", "2003 that started in China and caused a", "02:01", "terrible epidemic in Toronto it actually", "02:04", "took the Rolling Stones to do a concert", "02:07", "to bring the economy back to Toronto in", "02:09", "2003 and then it was mayors", "02:12", "virus infection in 2012 and this is the", "02:15", "third one so we actually realized that", "02:20", "corona viruses were going to become a", "02:21", "new thing and we embarked on a big run a", "02:24", "virus vaccine program a decade ago and", "02:26", "and each time they've caused devastating", "02:29", "Hospital epidemics they've affected", "02:31", "healthcare workers so the point is this", "02:34", "unfortunately has become an e normal for", "02:36", "the globe is terrible corona virus", "02:39", "epidemics and we saw this one coming up", "02:43", "in at the end of 2019 in China and I", "02:47", "knew we were in for trouble because", "02:49", "that's what coronaviruses do so you knew", "02:52", "that we were going to be in trouble", "02:54", "because there was no way they can", "02:55", "contain it and keep it in China well the", "02:58", "the difference what this one compared to", "03:01", "the other two was this the other two", "03:03", "SARS and mayor's now we call this new", "03:06", "one SARS too so the Rahsaan than mayors", "03:08", "than SARS too so both SARS one and", "03:11", "mayor's made you so sick and that's such", "03:14", "a high case fatality rate that anybody", "03:17", "who got it was almost immediately", "03:19", "hospitalized and basically out of the", "03:22", "community the the difference with this", "03:24", "one ironically is it as it's pretty", "03:27", "lethal it's about five to ten times more", "03:30", "lethal than regular flu seasonal flu but", "03:34", "also there's a big group of people who", "03:36", "don't get very sick at all", "03:37", "and so you have this sort of perfect mix", "03:41", "where it's not the most lethal infection", "03:44", "we've ever seen it's not the most", "03:46", "transmissible infection we've ever seen", "03:48", "but it's high enough in both categories", "03:50", "that it combines in this very toxic way", "03:53", "so what you have is you have a group of", "03:55", "people who are getting very sick or in", "03:57", "the intensive care unit like older", "03:59", "people those with diabetes and", "04:01", "hypertension even a group of younger", "04:03", "people who are getting it very sick and", "04:06", "then a larger group who are only getting", "04:08", "mildly sick who could still walk around", "04:10", "the community and be out in about and", "04:13", "stores and restaurants and infecting", "04:15", "everybody and so this is what's caused", "04:18", "the problem it's a it's highly", "04:20", "transmissible there's a big group of", "04:22", "people walking around spreading it", "04:25", "and a smaller subset but a big subset", "04:28", "we're getting very sick and even dying", "04:30", "in intensive care unit so that's what's", "04:32", "playing out in New York City right now", "04:33", "for instance do we know why so many", "04:36", "people are asymptomatic we don't we", "04:39", "really don't there's a rough correlation", "04:43", "age so younger people seem to do better", "04:45", "and actually kids seem to do really well", "04:48", "with this infection they don't they", "04:49", "don't get with it with one exception", "04:51", "that I'll tell you about in a minute", "04:52", "most kids don't get very sick at all but", "04:55", "they're helping with the community", "04:56", "spread and and we don't quite know why", "04:59", "also but something that's very important", "05:01", "and one of the reasons why I really", "05:04", "wanted to come on and talk to you about", "05:05", "kovat is we there's this buzz out there", "05:10", "in the community that it's only old", "05:12", "people that are getting sick and dying", "05:14", "and going to I see use but in fact the", "05:17", "Centers for Disease Control came out", "05:19", "with this very chilling document a few", "05:20", "weeks ago showing that about 1/3 of the", "05:23", "very sick people in the hospital are", "05:26", "under the age of 40 or 44 so between 20", "05:30", "and 44 young adults are getting very", "05:33", "sick and that word has not gotten out", "05:35", "adequately because when the fact this", "05:37", "infection first appeared in central", "05:39", "China it was all about older individuals", "05:42", "over the age of 70 those with diabetes", "05:44", "and hypertension and we didn't hear", "05:46", "about the young adults but then for", "05:48", "reasons that we don't understand we saw", "05:50", "this big group in Italy and France Spain", "05:53", "of younger adults and we're seeing that", "05:55", "play out in the US and I know in the", "05:58", "people who you know listen to you and", "06:00", "watch you know it's a big group between", "06:02", "that age of 20 and 44 and they really", "06:04", "need to hear that they're at risk for", "06:06", "severe illness despite what they might", "06:08", "have heard previously well we have a", "06:10", "friend Michael yo who was actually on a", "06:12", "podcast with me the week before he went", "06:15", "to New York he was there that weekend", "06:17", "actually and that's when he got it so he", "06:20", "got kovat 19 in Manhattan and then flew", "06:23", "back got sick and here's what's really", "06:26", "maybe you could help me with this he", "06:29", "said he was feeling terrible and then", "06:32", "took Advil and it got exponentially", "06:35", "worse is that coincidental do you think", "06:38", "I mean there's there's been talks of", "06:40", "avoiding ibuprofen Michaels 45 years old", "06:44", "very healthy very robust guy so when he", "06:47", "was I mean he was in the hospital for a", "06:49", "week and his words were I almost died I", "06:52", "mean he was really really concerned what", "06:55", "what about what about an ibuprofen so", "06:59", "there's been a lot of buzz on the", "07:01", "internet about ibuprofen and then the", "07:03", "World Health Organization came out with", "07:05", "a specific statement saying those are", "07:07", "rumors so there's that a lot of evidence", "07:10", "to say that you get worse with ibuprofen", "07:12", "probably he was just one of those young", "07:15", "adults that's gonna get very sick and", "07:17", "that's what this virus does it has the", "07:19", "ability to get deep into the pulmonary", "07:22", "system in your lungs binds to receptors", "07:25", "on the cells of your lungs and causes a", "07:27", "terrible pneumonia and on top of it you", "07:30", "get a big inflammatory response so it", "07:32", "really can it's a severe pneumonia can", "07:35", "even prevent your ability to breathe and", "07:37", "that's why so many people who are", "07:39", "getting really sick with this virus have", "07:41", "to go on respirators that's exactly what", "07:43", "happened to Michael he got pneumonia so", "07:45", "there's is that there's a rumor that you", "07:49", "shouldn't take ibuprofen but is that", "07:52", "unfounded are you advising people to", "07:54", "take ibuprofen do you think they should", "07:56", "just avoid it just in case and where did", "07:59", "this rumors start from and what what is", "08:01", "the concern the territory and then and", "08:02", "then you've got the problem you know", "08:04", "some people you know also say don't take", "08:07", "aspirin because if this is a respiratory", "08:09", "virus infection there could be a severe", "08:12", "reaction with with aspirin as well so", "08:14", "for now you know and I said the other", "08:17", "thing Joe is anything we say today I", "08:20", "might look like the biggest idiot in the", "08:23", "world tomorrow or next week and that's", "08:25", "because this is a brand-new virus and", "08:27", "we've never seen before right so we're", "08:29", "on a steep learning curve so we're", "08:31", "learning new things about this virus", "08:33", "every day so that's why you know so many", "08:36", "things I'm going to say today by", "08:38", "something like I'm waffling or hedging", "08:39", "it's it's because I am where we're", "08:42", "learning so much that's new about this", "08:44", "virus so it's really important that", "08:47", "everybody be really mindful and pay", "08:49", "attention to real health and", "08:51", "information that from accurate sources", "08:54", "because things move things change as we", "08:57", "learn more about this this is a virus", "08:58", "that we didn't even know existed about", "09:02", "four months ago and we've learned about", "09:04", "an incredible period of time the Chinese", "09:06", "put up a lot of information on these pre", "09:10", "print servers about what the virus is", "09:11", "what the sequence is the genetic code", "09:14", "what the receptor binds to when we had", "09:17", "the original sock that we call this new", "09:18", "one SARS to the Cova night so the but", "09:21", "the diseases called covin 19 the virus", "09:23", "is called SARS - SARS coronavirus - when", "09:26", "we had the original SARS one it took us", "09:29", "over a year to learn all that", "09:30", "information now everything's been", "09:31", "compressed in a few weeks so it's really", "09:34", "extraordinary but there's still so much", "09:36", "so much we're learning right now that", "09:38", "I'm so glad you brought that up because", "09:40", "that is really important for people to", "09:41", "understand people that maybe haven't", "09:43", "looked into the complications that are", "09:46", "involved in trying to recognize", "09:47", "treatments and cures for a virus that it", "09:49", "is it's you you everyone's learning yeah", "09:53", "and also you know and everything we have", "09:56", "known so far about the viruses what", "09:58", "happened in China and it turns out the", "10:01", "Chinese start to have some genetic", "10:03", "differences to Europeans and Americans", "10:05", "and and things can change depending on", "10:08", "it's not just the pathogen it's also", "10:10", "what we call the host the person - so", "10:12", "the fact you know that the virus", "10:14", "affected young adults in Europe and the", "10:17", "US in a way that did not necessarily", "10:19", "occur in China is important and so we", "10:23", "owe or keep we and then who knows what", "10:24", "happens when this virus goes into Latin", "10:27", "America or India or sub-saharan Africa", "10:29", "it may and it's not because the virus is", "10:31", "mutating necessarily it's just that", "10:33", "there's also the host component as well", "10:35", "which is quite important well that's one", "10:38", "of the issues that people are having in", "10:41", "terms of blood type there's there's all", "10:43", "this talk of certain blood types may be", "10:45", "more susceptible to the virus", "10:46", "particularly blood type a yeah well", "10:49", "actually this is actually well known in", "10:52", "the infectious disease literature there", "10:54", "I mean there's a whole I put one up on", "10:56", "Twitter I think a week or so ago there's", "10:59", "you know dozens of different pathogens", "11:01", "but including viruses and bacteria that", "11:04", "behave differently depending on on a", "11:06", "person's blood type so host genetics", "11:09", "influences things quite a bit", "11:12", "now let's talk about Germany because I", "11:15", "found that really fascinating when I was", "11:17", "reading on Germany and their low", "11:19", "mortality rate would what do you", "11:21", "attribute that to is that the health", "11:26", "care they have there or what is that", "11:30", "well let me give you first the opposite", "11:32", "side of the coin and then we'll talk", "11:33", "about your kids to the opposite side of", "11:35", "the clay what's happening in Italy in", "11:36", "Spain 10% mortality so 10% of the people", "11:41", "who are who are being diagnosed with", "11:43", "Kovan 19 have died which is higher than", "11:47", "just about anywhere else I think what's", "11:49", "happened there is when the health system", "11:53", "gets so overwhelmed that so many so that", "11:57", "in other words the transmission goes on", "11:59", "for a long time and you haven't picked", "12:00", "it up and then all of a sudden people", "12:02", "start showing up in the ICU then it's", "12:05", "too late then you start having massive", "12:07", "numbers of people come into the ICU the", "12:09", "hospital can take care of everybody they", "12:12", "can intubate everyone they can't give", "12:13", "everyone the highest quality care", "12:15", "possible is no fault of the doctors and", "12:17", "nurses there are heroes but the the fact", "12:20", "that they're completely overwhelmed with", "12:22", "patients that's when mortality starts to", "12:25", "really rise so we saw this in parts of", "12:28", "Wuhan and we saw this in Italy and that", "12:32", "was the big worry about New York that", "12:33", "the same thing would happen to New York", "12:34", "but I'll hold that thought for a second", "12:36", "in Germany so far we think it's a", "12:39", "combination that has been more younger", "12:41", "people getting it and the fact that the", "12:43", "hospital system was getting ready and", "12:45", "they've got that infrastructure in place", "12:48", "to manage that surge although they're", "12:51", "worried now too that it may start going", "12:54", "up in overwhelming things and then you", "12:56", "look at okay so if that's true what's", "12:58", "the story on the mortality rate in the", "12:59", "United States and interestingly so far", "13:02", "one of the highest has been Orleans and", "13:05", "I think what happened there was they", "13:07", "kept the Mardi Gras open they had lots", "13:09", "of mixing and people a lot large numbers", "13:13", "of people getting infected number one", "13:15", "and overwhelm the health system just", "13:17", "like in it", "13:18", "so there is so in New Orleans right now", "13:20", "the case fatality rate is between four", "13:23", "and five but there's another factor go", "13:25", "on in New Orleans", "13:26", "lots of people living in extreme poverty", "13:28", "and poverty is very linked to diabetes", "13:31", "and hypertension and we know diabetes", "13:34", "and hypertension is a big risk factor", "13:35", "for death so New Orleans is getting hit", "13:38", "twice one because the health systems", "13:40", "getting overwhelmed and second I think", "13:42", "you have a lot of african-americans", "13:45", "living in poverty with underlying", "13:46", "diabetes and hypertension and that's", "13:49", "causing that to skyrocket so you know I", "13:51", "was just on the phone today with the", "13:54", "leadership of Houston and saying you", "13:56", "know you know we have a similar", "13:57", "demographic to New Orleans in many ways", "13:59", "we're sister cities after Katrina kind", "14:02", "of linked at the hip and and you know", "14:05", "there our sister city we love them but", "14:07", "you know we have to recognize that even", "14:09", "though if we can handle the surge with", "14:11", "our Texas Medical Center we still have", "14:13", "that demographic of african-americans", "14:16", "Hispanics with underlying diabetes and", "14:18", "hypertension really worried we're gonna", "14:20", "see high mortality in Texas now is", "14:23", "another factor with Italy and their high", "14:25", "mortality rate smoking because when I", "14:28", "was in Italy I was stunned by how many", "14:31", "people smoked young people old people it", "14:33", "seemed like a large percentage of the", "14:34", "population smoked yeah really glad you", "14:37", "brought that up I should have I should", "14:38", "have remembered to say that so yeah so", "14:40", "in Charlotte so for instance Chinese", "14:43", "older Chinese men at really high", "14:46", "mortality rates and here's something", "14:47", "very interesting smoking actually up", "14:51", "regulates the receptor and the lungs", "14:54", "that the burner spines too so it seems", "14:57", "to make more copies of the receptor for", "15:00", "the virus to bind to so that may worsen", "15:03", "the disease so I think you're right I", "15:04", "think smoking is a factor the one", "15:06", "question that we don't know is what is", "15:09", "vaping do does vais is vaping also doing", "15:12", "that and could that be linked somehow to", "15:14", "the young and all the young adults that", "15:16", "we're seeing in the United States who", "15:19", "are getting hospitalized they actually", "15:21", "don't have higher mortality but they're", "15:23", "still getting very sick and their lives", "15:24", "are being saved because they're being", "15:26", "intubated and put on the vent but is", "15:27", "there a vaping connection again", "15:29", "new question we don't know it's", "15:31", "something that's gonna have to be looked", "15:33", "at", "15:33", "well this there's gonna be a lot to", "15:35", "unravel when all this is over and along", "15:37", "the way people are dealing with a lot of", "15:40", "misinformation which is one of the", "15:42", "reasons one of many reasons why I'm so", "15:44", "thankful for you for coming on the", "15:45", "podcast and and trying to educate us on", "15:48", "this thing what about just that's the", "15:50", "reason I'm going I've been going on in", "15:53", "between word you know we I co-lead a", "15:56", "team with my 20 year science partner dr.", "15:59", "Mary Elena patate see we're trying it", "16:01", "we've developed vaccines including", "16:02", "coronavirus vaccines we're trying to get", "16:04", "those out the door in clinical trials in", "16:06", "between I'm going on Fox News MSNBC and", "16:09", "CNN and that's not an easy needle to", "16:13", "thread either going on Fox News MSNBC", "16:15", "and see and then that's been really", "16:18", "interesting but I love the opportunity", "16:19", "and and I'm doing it because this is", "16:24", "there's a lot of bullshit out there's a", "16:26", "lot of misinformation trying to get", "16:28", "accurate information and also explaining", "16:30", "the science behind it because sometimes", "16:31", "you hear something that doesn't sound", "16:33", "right it sometimes takes a couple of", "16:35", "minutes to explain that and and those", "16:37", "three cable news networks have been", "16:39", "great about giving me some time to to", "16:41", "explain the thinking behind it which", "16:43", "they ordinarily wouldn't do that's great", "16:45", "now let's talk about treatments that are", "16:47", "being considered we know that Z packs", "16:51", "are one of them and chloroquine can you", "16:54", "explain that and and what went horribly", "16:57", "wrong with the couple that took the", "16:58", "wrong kind of chloroquine and turned out", "17:01", "to be a koi pond cleaner okay so let me", "17:06", "let me put give me the framework for", "17:07", "that so it makes some sense when we talk", "17:09", "about all the interventions you have", "17:11", "things that are going to be ready down", "17:13", "the line things are gonna be ready a", "17:15", "little closer and things ready now so", "17:17", "and then and then we can talk about what", "17:20", "I meant all we could let me give you the", "17:22", "framework that I'll to answer your", "17:24", "chloroquine question so the highest bar", "17:26", "there is in terms of financial", "17:28",

"17:38", "you know a year 18 months away according", "17:40", "to dr. pouchy", "17:41", "could be", "17:42", "longer than that next here down are what", "17:45", "we call small molecule drugs new

social distancing and other", "38:52", "aggressive measures and something that", "38:54", "were pretty aggressively couldn't even", "38:55", "do in the United States but they showed", "38:58", "that

to be the crunch time when it's", "42:28", "going to start really going up and then", "42:30", "as we move into later in May it'll start", "42:33", "to go down and maybe really bottomed out", "42:36", "by June of course again it's a model", "42:38", "it's a new virus pathogen but what I've", "42:41", "been saying is you know the president", "42:42", "yesterday or the day before said ok I", "42:45",

"42:54", "use April 30 as a time to reassess and", "42:57", "then make a decision whether we go in", "42:59", "other months let's go a month at a time", "43:01", "for now until we know where this is",

makes the", "43:32", "decisions we don't make the decision so", "43:35", "although not entirely true because we", "43:37", "can make we can enact an intervention so", "43:42", "hopefully by the summer this is not", "43:46", "going to be a huge problem but what we", "43:48", "don't know and then we also don't know", "43:50", "if this thing's coming back so what did", "43:53", "the out-years look like is this does the", "43:55", "even if it goes down this summer does it", "43:58", "does it come back up again in the fall", "44:00", "does it come back up again early", "44:05", "what's that why would that happen why", "44:06", "would it come back why would it why", "44:08", "would it go away and then come back in", "44:10", "the fall well there's a few things that", "44:12", "are happening one all the social", "44:13", "distancing potentially could interrupt", "44:15", "the transmission we use this number", "44:18", "called a reproductive number which", "44:20", "describes the number of people that get", "44:22", "infected if a single individual has it", "44:24", "so the number right now is between 2 & 4", "44:27", "depending on whose numbers you look at", "44:29", "the idea is you bring that below one by", "44:31", "the social distancing there's also the", "44:34", "question of whether there's seasonality", "44:35", "to the to this virus and again this guy", "44:40", "mark lipstick has done some studies to", "44:41", "show that there there seems the virus", "44:45", "infection doesn't seem to be as severe", "44:47", "in areas that have higher temperatures", "44:50", "and greater humidity it's a bit of a", "44:52", "soft call but maybe there's going to be", "44:55", "some seasonality to this as well and", "44:58", "then and so let's use an example of", "45:00", "another seasonal virus influenza you", "45:03", "know which Peaks of course in the winter", "45:04", "and then goes down in the summer months", "45:07", "it never really disappears but it it", "45:10", "goes down but then in the southern", "45:12", "hemisphere it's the opposite so in the", "45:14", "southern hemisphere peak flu season is", "45:17", "our summer their winter in places like", "45:19", "Australia and then in the tropics it's", "45:21", "about the same all year round so we", "45:23", "don't really understand seasonality", "45:25", "potentially the virus could show it", "45:27", "starts showing a pattern like that and", "45:30", "then the question is does a come back", "45:32", "year after year after year like flu does", "45:34", "or or and have shows some kind of", "45:37", "seasonality these are all scenarios that", "45:39", "that are being looked at so for instance", "45:41", "our vaccine if it's used and goes you", "45:44", "know goes through all the clinical", "45:46", "testing hurdles probably is not going to", "45:48", "be used for this 2020 epidemic if it's", "45:50", "used at all it's going to be used in the", "45:52", "out-years", "45:53", "if this virus starts to come back on a", "45:57", "regular basis is there any other way to", "46:01", "handle this in terms of quarantine or", "46:04", "social distancing like is there would", "46:08", "there would it be possible to quarantine", "46:11", "the people that are at most risk instead", "46:13", "of the general population", "46:16", "well well again the problem gets to the", "46:19", "fact that you know again there's this I", "46:22", "the this is only among older Americans", "46:28", "and people over the age of 70 diabetes", "46:30", "hypertension but now we as the Sinister", "46:33", "disease control has been reporting we've", "46:35", "had this big flux of young adults", "46:38", "getting very sick and in the ICU so what", "46:40", "point do you say pretty much everybody", "46:43", "potentially is at risk then among the", "46:44", "children even though the the children", "46:47", "generally are children adolescents seem", "46:50", "to do pretty well with this virus now we", "46:53", "realize from studies coming out of China", "46:55", "that was published in the journal called", "46:57", "Pediatrics put out by the American", "46:59", "Academy of Pediatrics thought about 10%", "47:01", "of infants are getting very sick with", "47:03", "this virus so infants are at risk so you", "47:06", "start adding it up okay older people", "47:09", "those underlying diabetes hypertension", "47:11", "and younger adults and 40 and 50 year", "47:14", "olds as well and we're hearing all these", "47:16", "stories on CNN and elsewhere about you", "47:19", "know valued colleagues you know in their", "47:21", "50s and that kind of thing getting", "47:23", "really sick or even even dying and then", "47:26", "infants after awhile it's just it's you", "47:29", "can't you can't slice it that fine", "47:32", "that's it becomes impossible to do it is", "47:35", "it one of the things that's come up", "47:38", "about this is people are now aware", "47:41", "people like myself are aware of the the", "47:44", "number of people that die every year in", "47:46", "the United States from the flu which is", "47:48", "staggering it's a lot more than I ever", "47:51", "thought before you know like do you know", "47:54", "the numbers like what would yeah so you", "47:57", "know seasonal flu is really bad it's at", "48:01", "various year-to-year different variants", "48:03", "of the flu so it usually goes between 12", "48:06", "and 50,000 people die of a year of", "48:08", "influenza and the vast majority of those", "48:11", "by the way are not vaccinated so even in", "48:13", "years where there's not a good match", "48:15", "between the flu vaccine and the flu it", "48:17", "could still reduce your likelihood of", "48:19", "hospitalization and death so that's an", "48:22", "important message to get out the numbers", "48:24", "here unfortunately looking worse for a", "48:27", "second how does that how does", "48:29", "work how even if it's not matched up to", "48:32", "this the correct seasonal flu how does", "48:34", "it prevent you from being hospitalized", "48:36", "because it's partially protective so if", "48:39", "you imagine a virus that has all of", "48:42", "these different pieces to it and and the", "48:47", "end and all the antibodies each reacting", "48:49", "to a different piece of the virus and a", "48:52", "perfect match all of the antibodies", "48:53", "target the virus in the in a less than", "48:56", "perfect match only some of the", "48:57", "antibodies target the virus and", "49:00", "therefore it's partially protective and", "49:02", "can you know have a have a partial", "49:04", "effect and so was I gonna say oh so the", "49:08", "it's different and now the numbers of", "49:10", "them of Americans who are dying are all", "49:12", "over the map so if you if you believe", "49:14", "the numbers saying that they're between", "49:16", "four and ten times the number of", "49:19", "Americans and I forget about America", "49:21", "four to ten times covetous ours to virus", "49:25", "that causes clove in nineteen is four to", "49:28", "ten times more lethal than regular flu", "49:32", "so that'll give you the bracket so the", "49:34", "minimum is twelve thousand from flu the", "49:37", "minimum that's going to die from Kovan", "49:39", "nineteen is around fifty thousand and", "49:41", "that the high end times ten could be", "49:43", "between five hundred thousand so that's", "49:45", "where you're hearing those numbers from", "49:48", "the White House press conference saying", "49:49", "maybe a hundred to two hundred thousand", "49:51", "Americans could die I think it's", "49:55", "probably I like the Institute for Health", "49:58", "metrics numbers that just came out they", "50:00", "say eighty four thousand Americans will", "50:02", "die in that peak season going from April", "50:07", "May May and June and then but we don't", "50:09", "know what will happen again", "50:10", "in the out here so the point is a lot of", "50:13", "Americans are going to die", "50:14", "I I'm hoping it doesn't get as high as", "50:17", "200,000 and again the modelers are", "50:20", "really looking at this the way those", "50:22", "numbers that I gave you that estimate", "50:23", "was a sort of simplistic version that", "50:25", "there's much more sophisticated models", "50:27", "but again they're models based on", "50:29", "assumptions over the new virus pathogen", "50:31", "it's hard to get all the assumptions", "50:33", "right but the point is many more people", "50:36", "will die of this virus than even in a", "50:38", "bad flu season I", "50:40", "people are concerned that this is kind", "50:42", "of setting a precedent and that this is", "50:44", "going to be something that we have to do", "50:45", "in the future is there a way to prevent", "50:47", "something like this a full shutdown of", "50:50", "the of the country to happen in the", "50:52", "future", "50:53", "well the way is you know we you know", "50:56", "we've got this incredible scientific", "50:58", "infrastructure in America right the best", "51:00", "research

he brought up", "59:59", "that I wanted to discuss is the damage", "60:01", "that this virus does to the lungs and to", "60:05", "the heart as well what there's scarring", "60:08", "on people's heart lungs did talk about", "60:11", "that and what if anything can be done to", "60:14", "try to heal those people post infection", "60:17", "well so what happens is you know the", "60:20", "virus gains entry into the deep passages", "60:24", "of the lungs you know the the all the", "60:26", "airway spaces and then it has if you", "60:28", "ever see a cartoon a schematic drawing", "60:31", "of a corona virus it looks like a little", "60:33", "ball with spikes sticking out of it and", "60:35", "those spikes are called the S protein", "60:37", "and actually the vaccine that we're", "60:39", "making interferes with the binding of a", "60:42", "part of that s protein called the", "60:44", "receptor binding domain for binding into", "60:46", "the receptor so it uses those spikes the", "60:49", "tip of the spikes to get entry to bind", "60:52", "to the receptors and in the lung which", "60:54", "is actually an enzyme called", "60:56", "acetylcholinesterase and it gets into", "60:58", "the lung cells so the first thing that", "61:00", "happens is a large amount of virus is", "61:03", "getting into the lungs and that triggers", "61:06", "what's called the innate immune system", "61:07", "meaning your natural first-line body of", "61:10", "defense and it's signals something", "61:12", "called toll-like receptors which cause a", "61:15", "lot of inflammation and so you're seeing", "61:18", "a big inflammatory response to the to", "61:21", "the virus so the two components are a", "61:25", "lot of virus causing direct damage and", "61:28", "then the host or the inflammatory", "61:29", "response and that's one of the reasons", "61:31", "why you know when I heard about", "61:32", "hydroxychloroquine I had some enthusiasm", "61:34", "because it can maybe suppress you know", "61:36", "Nitori component whether it clinically", "61:38", "has the ability to make a difference I", "61:41", "think the jury's still out yet but so", "61:44", "you've got those two things going on the", "61:46", "other thing that's happening besides and", "61:48", "that's causing severe lung disease and", "61:50", "there's all that inflammation and it", "61:51", "causes a condition known as a RDS acute", "61:55", "respiratory distress syndrome where", "61:57", "there's so much inflammation and", "61:59", "scarring that it becomes difficult to", "62:01", "oxygenate the lungs and people go into", "62:04", "shock because of this a RDS syndrome so", "62:07", "that's why a lot of people are dying the", "62:10", "other thing that happens though and we", "62:12", "don't really understand the mechanism", "62:13", "it's been a lot of reports and by the", "62:15", "way you can anybody can download this", "62:17", "there's this fantastic preprint server", "62:19", "called bio archive and med archive it's", "62:22", "fed up by Cold Spring Harbor", "62:23", "laboratories it's and I can check it", "62:25", "every morning it's called bi Oh our XIV", "62:29", "and Med archive is meed our XIV's but if", "62:33", "I Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory so", "62:34", "scientists have been great about sharing", "62:36", "information they're putting all their", "62:38", "stuff up on these preprint servers", "62:40", "they're not peer reviewed yet but just", "62:41", "that we get information into the hands", "62:44", "of the scientist and anybody could look", "62:45", "at them but one of the other things", "62:47", "we're seeing with that is a lot of heart", "62:49", "injury whether people are having heart", "62:51", "attacks because they're intubated in the", "62:53", "ICU and under stress and and they're in", "62:56", "shock so they're not perfusing the heart", "62:58", "or and we know that the old SARS virus", "63:02", "SARS one had the ability to go into the", "63:05", "heart tissue and cause what's called", "63:07", "myocarditis actual infection of the", "63:09", "heart so it's really the heart and lungs", "63:11", "that are getting knocked out there's", "63:14", "also some evidence that the virus can go", "63:16", "into the intestinal tract as well and so", "63:18", "that could actually be a potential route", "63:22", "of transmission mean fecal oral", "63:25", "transmission as well so this is why", "63:27", "people are getting so hammered is this", "63:29", "direct damage from the virus and the", "63:32", "inflammatory component to the heart and", "63:34", "alone", "63:34", "is there any understanding of what if", "63:37", "anything can be done to try to heal", "63:39", "these people post infection particularly", "63:42", "like damage to the lungs yeah I think", "63:45", "you know there are you know there's a", "63:46", "question of whether steroids actually", "63:48", "help or hurt steroids are always a", "63:50", "bag because steroids can suppress", "63:54", "inflammation and help the inflammatory", "63:55", "component but they also suppress the", "63:58", "immune response to the virus", "64:00", "so you could have an increased number of", "64:03", "virus particles potentially so people", "64:05", "are definitely looking into steroids", "64:07", "other anti-inflammatory drugs but you", "64:11", "know those who survive this and", "64:13", "fortunately most do you know you'll find", "64:17", "that there they'll probably tell you", "64:18", "they've been hacking and coughing for a", "64:21", "long time afterwards and a lot of that", "64:23", "is and we see this with flu as well and", "64:25", "other viral pneumonia is it's not", "64:27", "because they're still infected with the", "64:28", "virus it's all that scarring is it takes", "64:31", "the body a long time to remodel all the", "64:35", "scar tissue and and before the coughing", "64:38", "stops so we can anticipate that", "64:40", "happening as well what do we think it's", "64:42", "possible to fully recover from this for", "64:44", "people that do experience these lung", "64:45", "scarring issues yeah I think so", "64:48", "especially for younger people for older", "64:50", "people you know they may have some", "64:52", "permanent pulmonary deficits but we", "64:55", "don't know it's still too early in this", "64:57", "in this epidemic to know is that a big", "65:00", "part of what's going on is that it's", "65:01", "just really too early for so many of", "65:04", "these things the treatments the cures", "65:06",

news is", "65:26", "the the data sharing among scientists", "65:29", "has just been been amazing everyone's", "65:32", "you know putting aside the Ricoh putting", "65:34", "all their stuff up on bio
