question about I also worry", "12:18", "that we've we've idealized the bonobos", "12:23", "too much and you know we were sort of", "12:26", "it's very hard to be sympathetic with", "12:28", "the

that", "13:08", "we we feel comfortable so are idealizing", "13:12", "the bonobos", "13:13", "necessarily based on what they actually", "13:14", "are but based on like our little sort of", "13:17",

each particular game right and", "14:00", "that's that's essentially how nature", "14:02", "keeps moving forward right yeah you know", "14:05", "to the extent that you're wasting energy", "14:10",

people who", "70:14", "leave if you join you can join no one's", "70:17", "stopping them there the whole idea of", "70:19", "spreading Islam is that you should be", "70:24", "proselytizing you should be getting", "70:26", "people to join because it is the only", "70:27", "truth is the only way to go but once you", "70:29", "do join you're in like you're not", "70:32", "allowed to leave first of
