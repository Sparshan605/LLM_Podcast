on", "27:36", "if you hear or talk about it was like", "27:38", "there was just overwhelmed with", "27:39", "obligations and shed and just fought", "27:41", "wrong just didn't didn't fight correctly", "27:44", "I just had real problems going into that", "27:46", "and then you have like her approach like", "27:49", "getting in Ali's face the way in trying", "27:51", "to make it real emotional you know you", "27:53", "fake-ass bitch and all that stuff and", "27:55", "then all that emotions when she fought", "27:56", "in the rain just running after Holly and", "27:58", "Holly just fought like a
