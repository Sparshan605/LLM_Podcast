the", "32:23", "win I mean I don't know when it is but I", "32:26", "felt like cowboy was covering up in", "32:28", "eating shots and although I'm not", "32:30", "unhappy with the stoppage like I

against a bigger guy think he", "110:12", "does already I think he does because", "110:14", "he's my weight and his power so", "110:16", "substantial and angles he's surprising", "110:18", "guys with his angles yeah there's a", "110:21", "there's a lot that goes in that fight", "110:22", "man and again I'm a team of dos Santos", "110:26", "he's amazing champion I don't know if", "110:28", "that's the marquee fight though as crazy", "110:30", "as that sounds but here's what the thing", "110:33", "it might be after Fox because you got to", "110:35", "think that UFC on Fox got millions of", "110:37", "people to watch and we saw a destroyer", "110:40", "and dos on well what are we talking", "110:42", "about what's everyone talking about", "110:43", "Diaz we are talking about Diaz that
