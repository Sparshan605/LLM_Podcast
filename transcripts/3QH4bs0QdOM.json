the time there you go like they", "68:10", "would force people to start using", "68:12", "certain amount of grains of rice like", "68:15", "type things in all of the house like", "68:18", "well we have a thirty grain house so hey", "68:20", "if anything the government wants to know", "68:22", "Matt I mean there's 30 grains in my", "68:23", "house is like one grain in your bathroom", "68:26",
