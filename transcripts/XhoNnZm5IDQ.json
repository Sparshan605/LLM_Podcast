"39:09", "you know Randy Couture yeah but I think", "39:12", "it's just that I don't think it's about", "39:14", "his context I think it's about who he is", "39:16", "as a person just like me it's like it's", "39:17", "not no one trained me to be a teacher", "39:19", "right like when I was in when I was", "39:20", "taking when I entered college I had no", "39:23", "idea was gonna be a teacher but I", "39:24", "remember sitting in these college", "39:26", "classes it kind of weren't very good", "39:27", "and I remember think that I spent a lot", "39:29", "of my time thinking about how I would", "39:31", "teach this differently than this guy was", "39:33", "teaching it and then I realized oh wait", "39:35", "I just I was I'm actually studying the", "39:37", "teaching more than the subject itself", "39:40", "how to communicate these ideas I was", "39:42", "studying more than the subject itself", "39:44", "and then I just it dawned on me finally", "39:46", "it's like oh well that means you", "39:47", "probably should be", "39:48", "teacher hmm and when I finally started", "39:50", "doing it in graduate school at Columbia", "39:51", "I was teaching you know philosophy", "39:53", "actually and yeah I just I've loved it", "39:56", "it was just my passion do you find this", "39:58", "deal is you teach things that it helps", "40:00", "you better understand them too because", "40:02", "you go over them from a real fundamental", "40:04", "perspective precisely yes I see right so", "40:06", "you don't and that was the first thing I", "40:08", "learned when I started teaching was that", "40:10", "I thought I knew Plato really well you", "40:12", "know until I started in let until I knew", "40:14", "that I had to teach him the next day", "40:16", "mm-hmm then I was like oh wait a minute", "40:17", "I didn't quite actually get that", "40:19", "connection there between those two ideas", "40:21", "in his book you know yeah you have to I", "40:23", "tell my students this all the time I", "40:25", "said you need to be as comfortable so", "40:28", "comfortable with this text that you can", "40:30", "teach it to your roommate who's never", "40:31", "read it before hmm that means what that", "40:33", "means is you have to think all the way", "40:35", "through the ideas you have to go all", "40:38", "with your mind", "40:39", "all the way through the ideas and them", "40:41", "come back through them right it's just", "40:44", "like it's like martial arts or anything", "40:45", "else yeah you have to actually do the", "40:47", "Japanese necktie all the way through and", "40:49", "come back all the way through it and", "40:51", "then you can teach it all the way", "40:53", "through the master it Taekwondo career I", "40:56", "taught I taught at Boston University I", "40:59", "taught my own school I taught classes", "41:00", "like I taught the entire time it's more", "41:02", "the way I made a living and another and", "41:04", "it helped me tremendously it helped me", "41:06", "understand it and I didn't realize how", "41:08", "much it helped me until I started doing", "41:10", "jujitsu and I watched other people who", "41:13", "started teaching jujitsu just jump ahead", "41:16", "by leaps and bounds from where they were", "41:18", "a good example is my friend Brent he was", "41:21", "like a purple belt and he was always", "41:23", "like a certain level kind of a static", "41:26", "level and then not static but you know", "41:29", "improving but nothing crazy he was like", "41:31", "everybody else right what jujitsu hard", "41:33", "takes a long time to get better and", "41:34", "you're around other people that are also", "41:35", "getting better so it's hard to look", "41:37", "really measure oh yeah you know but then", "41:39", "he started teaching and like teaching", "41:42", "full-time and then all of a sudden I", "41:44", "would roll with him and I'd be in like", "41:46", "great danger I'd be like Jesus and I had", "41:49", "a conversation with him once after", "41:50", "training with him like dude I don't know", "41:52", "what the fuck you're doing but you're", "41:54", "your game is jumped like four or five", "41:56", "steps ahead yeah I feel like I'm the", "41:58", "same as I was six seven months ago and", "42:01", "was like years ahead right he said it", "42:03", "was all just teaching and and I remember", "42:05", "now that that was the first time I", "42:06", "really felt confident as an intellectual", "42:09", "you know as when you were teaching the", "42:10", "subjects at once I had taught them it", "42:12", "was like oh now I actually feel I was", "42:14", "always I mean everybody's racked with", "42:15", "insecurity especially in graduate school", "42:17", "about these things you know everybody", "42:18", "feels like an imposter right because we", "42:20", "all these all all of us have you know", "42:22", "500 books that everyone else has read", "42:24", "that you should have read that we", "42:25", "haven't read rom and I came from this", "42:28", "little dipshit college and you know Ohio", "42:31", "and I was like a C student in high", "42:33", "school so I extra insecurity but once I", "42:35", "started teaching it and forcing myself", "42:37", "to as you said like learn the thing all", "42:39", "the way through it and master it and", "42:41", "then teaching it that's when I felt oh", "42:42", "yeah I belong here", "42:43", "I get it I really do have some solid", "42:46", "understanding of Plato now and I really", "42:48", "I really can do this thing you know it's", "42:51", "interesting that you're saying that", "42:52", "because that's a big issue with", "42:53", "comedians too and and like as they're", "42:56", "becoming successful especially they feel", "42:59", "like frauds like everybody I know says", "43:01", "that I said everybody I know that sort", "43:04", "of like started to make it like as", "43:06", "they're like starting to headline and go", "43:08", "on the road places and do a television", "43:10", "sets and things along those lines you", "43:11", "feel like a fraud when you're successful", "43:13", "yes yeah you like I'm you know because", "43:16", "you look at yourself and then you look", "43:18", "at you know Dave Chappelle or someone", "43:20", "else Chris Rock and you're like I'm a", "43:22", "fucking fraud I'm a fraud I'm not that", "43:24", "guy I'm a fraud I'm not Richard Jeni I'm", "43:26", "a fraud and then I'm sure it takes a", "43:28", "long time before you feel like", "43:30", "comfortable enough to like say I know", "43:32", "what I'm doing in academia it's called", "43:35", "the charlatan syndrome right we all feel", "43:37", "like we're charlatans I think it exists", "43:38", "in everything everything difficult I'm", "43:40", "not surprised", "43:41", "and I think it's also probably a", "43:42", "hallmark of someone who cares yeah", "43:45", "absolutely that's what makes you better", "43:46", "yeah yeah I don't think every academic", "43:48", "has that but I think those who do are", "43:51", "the ones who are interesting and get", "43:52", "better right well I think the worse", "43:54", "would be the opposite someone is like", "43:56", "super confident way before their time", "43:58", "yeah that's what I mean yeah right", "44:00", "they're gonna suck there's a lot of that", "44:01", "too though right yeah there's a lot of", "44:03", "weirdness and academia man no kidding I", "44:06", "can't imagine the stuff you guys go", "44:08", "through politically oh my god cuz just", "44:10", "you saying that you couldn't talk about", "44:12", "boxing because you would be thought of", "44:14", "as a", "44:14", "fool so that's the thing I know you're", "44:18", "really interested in this and I am too", "44:20", "and the there are some misconceptions", "44:23", "and that why shouldn't say they're", "44:25", "misconceptions I would say that there's", "44:28", "a distortion of what's going on and this", "44:29", "is not to say it's it's actually to say", "44:32", "that it's worse than you think it is oh", "44:34", "so what most people who are outside of", "44:37", "academia think is going on is not quite", "44:39", "what's going on what do you think we", "44:40", "think it's something worse why no", "44:42", "because I've hear her doing lots and", "44:43", "lots of people talk about and it's not", "44:44", "your fault at all because you're not", "44:45", "there and all you do is get the media", "44:46", "reports about it so I think what most", "44:48", "people I get it from GAD sad and Jordan", "44:50", "Peterson yeah professors they and they", "44:53", "if you listen to them actually they will", "44:55", "they themselves will talk about it a", "44:56", "little differently but people still", "44:57", "consume it differently because the news", "44:59", "right is all about the crazy thing that", "45:02", "the 18 year old said right at Wesleyan", "45:04", "or whatever or it's not the 18 year old", "45:06", "it's the 45 year old and sometimes the", "45:08", "45 year old yeah okay but here's the so", "45:11", "that's stuff that really sort of Looney", "45:14", "stuff you know that you hear coming out", "45:16", "or protest you know people saying that", "45:19", "they are gonna die because you said a", "45:22", "word that happens it does it's all true", "45:26", "it's all there I've seen it but I've", "45:28", "seen it maybe at most one time a year in", "45:32", "the colleges where I've been maybe not", "45:34", "even less than that okay what is and if", "45:38", "it were just that that's not actually a", "45:40", "big deal it's much worse than that", "45:41", "what's what's worse is that if that", "45:45", "there is a self-censorship going on", "45:48", "that's universal and profound constant", "45:52", "omnipresent like for instance you know I", "45:56", "never talk about my love for boxing", "45:58", "around academics or I'm very careful if", "46:01", "I do but it's not even that it's that we", "46:03", "know that there's certain things that", "46:04", "can't be said on a college campus and so", "46:06",

"46:17", "for the people that are holding back on", "46:18", "thoughts that maybe they would normally", "46:20", "express okay don't well here's what I", "46:22", "think it is for the senior faculty who", "46:24", "have tenure", "46:24", "meaning lifetime appointments cowardice", "46:28", "that's all it is I think they're cowards", "46:30", "yeah if you are an adjunct like me with", "46:33", "no job security or if you're an", "46:35", "assistant professor up for tenure and if", "46:37", "you don't get tenure you have no career", "46:39", "I don't blame them I get it that's what", "46:41",

clearly a bad killing and", "81:09", "it was a bad killing but not for the", "81:11", "reasons that people are talking about I", "81:12", "have no way to know whether that cop was", "81:14", "racist and that's why he did that but we", "81:16", "do know and people have done work on", "81:18", "this that he it is very reasonable to", "81:21", "assume that he was doing in that moment", "81:24",

he's running away and he gets you", "82:07", "know a good whatever ten 20 yards away", "82:09", "and the cop shoots him in the back okay", "82:10", "so according to South Carolina police", "82:13",

work", "82:52", "the cop was looking he may not have seen", "82:54", "that that the Taser was on the ground", "82:56", "I'm super confused cuz I thought that", "82:58", "the cop dropped no no I'm not

know for sure but I know", "83:36", "this was the argument made by Scott by", "83:37", "the cops lawyer was that it is totally", "83:40", "reasonable to assume that he believed he", "83:44", "was he had reason to shoot him legally", "83:46", "so that's one part of that story right", "83:50", "which is that the law is the problem", "83:52", "okay mhm not the cop stop focusing on", "83:55", "the cop you'll never find out you'll", "83:56", "never be able to prove that he did it", "83:58", "because he's a racist and even if we did", "84:00", "what's that gonna give to what's that", "84:01",

these it's not just", "102:43", "moving it sorry that's a bad word to use", "102:45", "here it is calling it out as a fiction", "102:47", "mm-hmm as a social construct which is", "102:49", "that these lines have been drawn all the", "102:53", "time in all kinds of different ways over", "102:56", "the centuries by human beings who just", "102:59", "look at all the people in the world they", "103:00", "line up the seven billion people right", "103:02", "in their mind and they draw lines is", "103:04", "that oh these people over here this side", "103:06", "those are the Negroes and over here", "103:08", "these are the Mongoloids and over here", "103:09", "these the Asiatics and over here these", "103:11", "are the Nordics and over here are the", "103:12", "Aryans and the Jews and is it mm-hmm and", "103:14", "has change all the time but these are", "103:16", "his categories we invent right so who's", "103:20", "black Jimi Hendrix black well Jimi", "103:23", "Hendrix has a mixed

go got a lot in them but soon", "103:33", "but there's a big difference between", "103:35", "someone like Jimi Hendrix and someone", "103:38", "that is like very very dark okay comes", "103:41", "from a specific part of the world where", "103:43", "everyone around them is very very dark", "103:45", "let's do that they have very obvious and", "103:47", "repeatable characteristics let's do that", "103:49", "so Congo these knives come for sure I'll", "103:51", "go okay the people there they're pygmies", "103:54", "actually you know what do we need to do", "103:57", "West African okay okay where slaves", "104:00", "where the West were the Western slaves", "104:01", "American slaves come from and just", "104:05", "across the continent not even that far", "104:07", "away", "104:07", "you know there's Somalia", "104:09", "you know what Somalians look like right", "104:11", "yeah and Ethiopians mm-hmm right you", "104:13", "think about them and how they look and", "104:15", "think about how you know a West West", "104:18", "Africans look are they the same race", "104:20", "well very very very visible", "104:22", "characteristics Molly right Somalis look", "104:25", "different than everybody right clearly", "104:27", "right you know a Somali immediately", "104:29", "right same continent same pigmentation", "104:32", "basically very rayon yeah under facial", "104:36", "structures very different mmm why are", "104:38", "they black why are they the same race", "104:40", "but is that the same race I mean what", "104:43", "I'm saying about Somalians like would", "104:45", "you would you consider Somalians the", "104:47", "same as like Ethiopians or as the same", "104:50", "as Egyptian my thing is also Africa my", "104:52", "thing is let's get rid of these", "104:54", "categories there these are all silly", "104:56", "made-up categories there's no reason to", "104:58", "do they're all arbitrary", "105:00", "okay lines have been drawn between", "105:02", "groups of people arbitrarily over the", "105:05", "centuries well what you see you're", "105:08", "arguing against something that sam", "105:09", "harris said so what did sam harris a", "105:11", "specific studies him it's a lot of", "105:12", "people but so you don't agree that there", "105:15", "is any race at all I'm just saying it's", "105:17", "a fiction it's made up right it's just a", "105:19", "it's like is it a fiction others in a", "105:21", "way we're trying to define the", "105:23", "variations between human groups because", "105:26", "there are variations oh that's", "105:28", "definitely what it's been about that's", "105:30", "definitely been the motivation mm-hmm", "105:32", "right and think about what the", "105:33", "consequences have been okay but it's", "105:36", "never been good just because there's", "105:37", "consequences for variations or", "105:39", "recognizing variations doesn't mean you", "105:41", "should stop recognizing actual", "105:43", "variations so then you make but they", "105:44", "always make claims right after that like", "105:46", "don't have to what's and there is", "105:48", "strawman isn't it I mean you don't have", "105:50", "to make a claim that Chinese people are", "105:51", "different because they look different no", "105:53", "but you say well this is what a Chinese", "105:55", "person sure generally they have these", "105:57", "very stringent characteristics they", "106:00", "don't have blonde hair they don't have", "106:01", "blue eyes not tall and skinny they look", "106:04", "like Chinese sure but then again Chinese", "106:06", "people all look the same I mean there's", "106:09", "no I'd say that right but again was a", "106:11", "clear characteristic the difference", "106:13", "between a Chinese person and a black", "106:14", "person is very clear not really well not", "106:19", "always Kenyans who lives in Kenya who's", "106:22", "born", "106:23", "multiple generations deep and their", "106:26", "parents are Kenyan their grandparents", "106:27", "are Kenyan there's a very big difference", "106:29", "between them and someone who lives in", "106:31", "Shanghai yeah but who was born in", "106:33", "Shanghai their parents are born in", "106:34", "Shanghai they go all the way back you", "106:37", "know many many generations of being pure", "106:39", "Chinese right but there are infinite", "106:40", "variations even among people who have", "106:42", "lived only in Shanghai but do you want", "106:44", "to call it variations", "106:45", "nothing but what are you talking about", "106:47", "something that's clearly identifiable", "106:49", "you just I would say that there's of", "106:52", "course there are genes that run in", "106:54", "families and I completely agree that you", "106:57", "know genes determine in large part how", "106:59", "we look fine", "107:01", "so you can certainly say this person is", "107:03", "likely because of their genes connected", "107:06", "to that person last generation to that", "107:08", "generation to this you know in his", "107:10", "family lineage sure well what does that", "107:11", "give you I don't know nothing I mean", "107:14", "it's the thing is that people have taken", "107:16", "that and they've said oh well these", "107:18", "particular characteristics are human", "107:21", "beings were talking about complexity in", "107:22", "human beings at the beginning of this", "107:23", "right people are infinitely complex", "107:25", "right okay so the thing is what people", "107:28", "have done historically is they've just", "107:29", "picked certain characteristics among", "107:32", "people and said ah that is what", "107:34", "determines your race is the issue the", "107:36", "word race is maybe the issue like there", "107:39", "are obvious physical characteristics the", "107:42", "difference between like someone who is a", "107:44", "Mongol versus someone who is Brazilian", "107:48", "versus someone who is there's some", "107:49", "pretty obvious physical characteristics", "107:52", "for geographic areas which would you", "107:55", "agree like or common physical", "107:57", "characteristics for some geographic area", "107:59", "sure you could say on average people in", "108:02", "China are shorter than people in", "108:05", "Polynesia well here's a place where you", "108:07", "could do it Canada I can try to find a", "108:09", "Canadian like you don't know what a", "108:10", "Canadian looks like they could be", "108:12", "English they could be American they", "108:14", "could cause trying to entertain your", "108:15", "your strongest argument okay so like", "108:17", "China right you could certainly say that", "108:20", "people in China are on average on", "108:22", "average shorter than people in Polynesia", "108:24", "right will they look different that's", "108:27", "one way in which they look different", "108:28", "right they're talking about", "108:30", "physiognomies facial features that bone", "108:32", "structure yeah Polynesians find be like", "108:35", "really stout pea", "108:36", "I suppose you could say you know the the", "108:39", "width of their eyes is narrower or", "108:41", "whatever on average and whatever sure", "108:43", "okay okay so what that's it I mean what", "108:46", "did we okay so they they are likely to", "108:49", "be in lineage from that part of the", "108:52", "world fine that's cool I got no problem", "108:55", "with that but what else do you want to", "108:56", "say the thing is Joe no one stops there", "108:59", "they always go on to that they always go", "109:02", "on from there and they start to make all", "109:04", "these other claims oh well", "109:06", "that race is really good at math their", "109:09", "IQ is higher this is what actually sam", "109:11", "harris and charles murray we're just", "109:12", "saying they can do the they can do the", "109:15", "they can do the coding for google better", "109:18", "than then other people can whatever", "109:20", "right they are more they are more", "109:22", "scrupulous they smoke cigarettes more", "109:25", "whatever it is you know they used to be", "109:26", "accused of being more easily addicted to", "109:28", "opium you name it right things change", "109:31", "but that's the problem is that once you", "109:33", "start there people have used those", "109:35", "differences for other reasons almost", "109:38", "always which are nefarious and injurious", "109:43", "terrible things to people your problem", "109:46", "is recognizing those characteristics and", "109:49", "those differences and calling it a race", "109:51", "and then attaching all sorts of other", "109:54", "claims to this category precisely okay", "109:57", "yeah that's exactly what sam and charles", "109:59", "murray this is charles maurice thing", "110:01", "although it's actually it's only a small", "110:03", "part of his work and he gets accused of", "110:05", "it being central and it's not but anyway", "110:07", "he does still nonetheless believe this", "110:09", "and so does sam harris and so does other", "110:10", "people that there are differences in IQ", "110:15", "among races okay now on the surface", "110:19", "level they are completely correct", "110:21", "there's no question meaning that IQ", "110:25", "scores among people that we identify as", "110:30", "african-american have been lower than", "110:33", "among the people we define as white", "110:37", "american totally true totally true and", "110:41", "they are right that that is suppressed", "110:42", "that we are not allowed to even talk", "110:44", "about that data which is there and it's", "110:46", "i have no problem with that i'm sure", "110:48", "that's true", "110:49", "here's the thing though how do we define", "110:51", "african-american and how do we define", "110:53", "white first it's the first problem those", "110:56", "as you know definitions have changed", "110:59", "over time so Jews used to be in the", "111:02", "african-american group and Italians used", "111:03", "to be in the african-american group well", "111:05", "no no they were never called", "111:07", "african-american yeah they were they", "111:08", "were called Negroes why yes they were", "111:10", "Jews were called Negro is a book written", "111:12", "is in my

people who are not", "153:59", "of the elite college culture won", "154:01", "something and it caused the elites to", "154:04", "freak completely out so if you look at", "154:08", "like I was looking at the top podcast", "154:11", "cuz you know I just started a podcast", "154:12", "and it it did get ranked and so I'm", "154:14", "excited but I'm looking at it a lot and", "154:15", "like you can
