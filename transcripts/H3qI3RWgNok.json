oh god damn yeah so", "02:01", "that was what what it that was kind of", "02:04", "how this sort of joint got famous but", "02:07", "normally what happens is those toes", "02:09", "those two bones right there the first", "02:11", "and second metatarsal can either spread", "02:13", "or converge one way or the other and", "02:16", "that's usually what al is Frank fracture", "02:18", "is I had the best of the three which is", "02:20", "I had a crack you can just see on the", "02:22", "right side of ya if you go down with the", "02:25", "cursor right there just a little lower", "02:26", "there's a little crack right there right", "02:29", "there on that corner um and then the", "02:32", "next one broke across you can just see", "02:34", "right there it's cracked across and then", "02:36", "so it kind of went to line up and across", "02:38", "the foot and then the other two are just", "02:40", "destroyed", "02:41", "yeah the third one displaced the fourth", "02:43", "one shattered in about eight pieces the", "02:45", "doctor said he lost count putting him", "02:46", "back together and then you know you", "02:48", "would know from injuries the problem", "02:50", "with when they're shatters a bone", "02:51", "they're not getting the blood flow so", "02:53", "it's not like a four or five week repair", "02:56", "job it's like that was like nine months", "02:58", "before that thing was back together", "02:59", "properly so when they do that how did", "03:01", "they piece that shattered one back", "03:04", "together again delicately and they put", "03:06", "like a mesh over so I got to kind of", "03:09", "like figure out how well I had I had a", "03:13", "plate on the list Frank and then I had a", "03:15", "plaint Playa kind of a bridge across the", "03:19", "third and fourth and so they kind of", "03:21", "meshed it all together and then I think", "03:24", "I had 16 screws combined in all that to", "03:29", "him it was it was brutal the problem", "03:32", "with it was I did it in South Africa", "03:34", "where I wasn't gonna get surgery so I", "03:37", "had to wait for this one to go down for", "03:39", "about six days before I could fly Oh God", "03:41", "because they thought the foot was gonna", "03:42", "swell too much because it was already", "03:44", "swollen from the event so I iced the", "03:45", "shit on my foot for like you know five", "03:48", "days and sat there and watch", "03:49", "unfortunately the waves were perfect I", "03:51", "was sitting on the beaches watching", "03:52", "perfect waves you know it's like that's", "03:54", "like as painful as the injury to a", "03:56", "surfer you know it's like watching a", "03:57", "bunch of elk walk by in front of you and", "04:00", "and not not scare to you right and so I", "04:05", "I sat there because the the whole time", "04:07", "prior to me being injured while I was", "04:09", "there for like two weeks the waves", "04:10", "weren't very good so I broke my foot in", "04:12", "the way he's got great Oh decided watch", "04:14", "it so it's that's painful for us but uh", "04:16", "so that waited for this one to go down", "04:18", "and then I it's two red eyes to get back", "04:20", "it was there no way you could get it", "04:22", "fixed in South Africa I maybe could've", "04:24", "but then I was probably looking at", "04:26", "saying Africa", "04:27", "for a month or more and and also I", "04:30", "didn't know that the quality sort of", "04:32", "level of quality of doctor I was gonna", "04:33", "get there and I I got a doctor I work", "04:36", "with here and I called him straightaway", "04:37", "I said look I it's my fourth broken foot", "04:40", "but I've never broken it like this", "04:42", "usually it's like let it heal for four", "04:44", "weeks and you're surfing and it's all", "04:45", "from surfing yeah and already the same", "04:48", "way oh really really pretty much the", "04:50", "board going back against the foot Wow", "04:52", "because and usually it happens when I'm", "04:54", "you know I don't know how well versed", "04:56", "you are and surfing but when I'm tube", "04:58", "riding and usually with my back to the", "05:00", "wave which has happened two or three", "05:02", "times so I'm in the wave the lip pitches", "05:05", "over and lands but when that lands it", "05:07", "sends a shock back into the way like you", "05:10", "know when the lip hits flat water that", "05:13", "lip some of the energy goes down and", "05:15", "some disperses out and up and some comes", "05:17", "back into the tube so if it does that", "05:19", "you're in the wrong spot the board will", "05:20", "flip into your feet but normally what we", "05:24", "do is we when your backside barrel ride", "05:26", "a lot of times you're grabbing the rail", "05:27", "so you kind of have both your feet and", "05:29", "your hand on it so you can handle that", "05:31", "shock mmm but if you're just going no", "05:33", "hand back side it's usually a pretty big", "05:35", "intense barrel and and so that lip has a", "05:38", "lot of energy and it shoots a ton of", "05:40", "force back towards you and if the hit", "05:43", "your board just rolling it can flip in", "05:44", "your foot and break it do you know", "05:45", "anybody else has broken their foot like", "05:47", "you like that not this bad one guy on", "05:50", "tour broke his foot pretty bad requiring", "05:53", "surgery this year that look horrible man", "05:56", "how long was it before you can walk now", "05:57", "you're walking totally normal now so how", "05:59", "long has it been since the surgery yeah", "06:00", "so so I had surgery in end of July last", "06:03", "year and then walking normal wasn't till", "06:09", "maybe December January Wow", "06:14", "well December I competed again but I", "06:15", "probably shouldn't have but we're we're", "06:18", "at pipeline in Hawaii which is you're", "06:21", "not doing maneuver it's not a small wave", "06:22", "kind of cop if the waves are small I", "06:24", "wouldn't have served since it's a little", "06:26", "easier because you take off and kind of", "06:28", "trim a straight line right so you're", "06:30", "kind of going straight you know even", "06:31", "though you're riding the barrel you're", "06:32", "kind of going straight but are you", "06:34", "conscious of your foot being compromised", "06:36", "yeah Wow I don't know it just that's my", "06:39", "favorite event in the world so I just", "06:41", "didn't want to miss it but fuck if you", "06:42", "broke your foot again yeah but then you", "06:46", "know the bones were pretty good back", "06:47", "together then and I could walk somewhat", "06:50", "without pain and if I put myself in a", "06:53", "real vulnerable vano vulnerable position", "06:56", "on a wave I would kind of maybe jump off", "06:58", "you know I wouldn't really push it it's", "06:59", "not worth winning a contest oh yeah foot", "07:02", "again but I'm sure to be able to surf", "07:04", "pipeline with no-one else is kind of", "07:06", "worth a little risk now when you are", "07:09", "healing is there anything they give you", "07:11", "that can accelerate bone healing or is", "07:13", "there any supplements or a lot of it is", "07:16", "kind of I mean it's the furthest place", "07:19", "from your heart right so and it's it's", "07:21", "down at the bottom of your body so you", "07:22", "gotta kind of get that foot up like a", "07:24", "lot of times I'll sit against a wall and", "07:26", "elevate my foot and let it completely", "07:28", "flush out you know when you're a kid and", "07:30", "you kind of hold your hand and somebody", "07:32", "pushes all the blood out of your hand", "07:33", "you ever do that one no it's like this", "07:35", "trick where somebody holds your your", "07:38", "wrists your your arteries so no Bloods", "07:39", "going in you push all the hand all the", "07:41", "blood out and then you let it go and", "07:43", "it's like a little spider web feel like", "07:45", "if somebody go like that it feels", "07:46", "awesome I know I did do that when I was", "07:48", "a kid yeah I just kind of imagined", "07:50", "that's what I was doing with my foot up", "07:52", "and like okay all the Bloods getting out", "07:54", "of my foot now and um but did you like", "07:58", "research whether there's something that", "07:59", "accelerates bone healing or you can use", "08:02", "magnets like magnets yes", "08:04", "some people believe magnets help", "08:06", "increase the circulation and thus the", "08:09", "the especially a rotating magnet cuz it", "08:12", "kind of creates a force field around", "08:13", "your foot really yeah supposedly I mean", "08:16", "around the magnets but is this like are", "08:18", "these legit people or these like these", "08:20", "are like", "08:21", "theories healers I'm an energy healer", "08:24", "well I'm just saying what I've heard", "08:26", "people right so the first time I broke", "08:28", "my foot a guy a chiropractor guy I had", "08:33", "going to he's like just when you go to", "08:34", "sleep is not gonna hurt you just put it", "08:35", "on your foot and I was actually", "08:37", "competing five weeks after I broke that", "08:41", "foot so I don't know if it helped or not", "08:42", "but I just sleep and it was near my foot", "08:45", "and maybe it helped that take six weeks", "08:47", "for a bone to heal right doesn't it", "08:50", "moron protects for weeks and", "08:53", "then it takes two more weeks for the", "08:54", "calcium to properly fill in so like the", "08:57", "if you take an x-ray after four weeks", "08:59", "it'll still look like there's a hole", "09:01", "like a break there but apparently the", "09:03", "bone has sutured itself back but if", "09:07", "calcium has not filled in to make it", "09:09", "totally strong ah that's what I was told", "09:12", "by my doctor on this last one because I", "09:14", "asked every question possible why is it", "09:16", "still it broke and why is it and he was", "09:18", "telling me you know it's not till you", "09:19", "get enough blood flow and then it's", "09:21", "healed and then it's once there's the", "09:23", "proper blood flow in the bone then you", "09:25", "get the calcium coming back and the only", "09:27", "thing that I've heard that really", "09:28", "supposed to accelerate healing is a", "09:30", "hyperbaric chamber did you which I", "09:32", "didn't do I had one sort of at hand in", "09:35", "Hawaii I could have go into but I didn't", "09:36", "oh it's supposed to I know that Uriah", "09:38", "Faber used that a lot after he fought", "09:40", "Josie Aldo", "09:41", "although kicked the shit out of his leg", "09:43", "and his leg was really badly swollen it", "09:45", "was horrible no great did he break the", "09:46", "bone no it didn't break the bone but it", "09:48", "was it was so bad it was like his left", "09:51", "leg was literally twice

the", "51:43", "skill coming back you know I mean I", "51:46", "probably should have kept with it", "51:47", "because then I could have walked around", "51:48", "for a while kept my foot high right but", "51:50", "no but I mean my point is that like", "51:52", "pretty quickly your body starts to", "51:53", "attune to that thing like I used to do", "51:55", "push-ups on the back of my wrist this", "51:57", "buddy of mine who was into some martial", "51:59", "arts he's like do risk push-ups and well", "52:01", "what's the benefit of that he was just", "52:02", "saying to strengthen your wrist I don't", "52:04", "know he used to do it but the first time", "52:06", "I did it it really hurt my wrist and", "52:08", "then after about a week of doing it", "52:10", "didn't hurt my wrist anymore your body", "52:11", "just kind of adjust - yeah but I don't", "52:15", "know I think I'm gonna start doing", "52:16", "handstands and doing that Burmese", "52:19", "volleyball thing how long did it take I", "52:22", "mean we--you on crutches or you in a", "52:24", "wheelchair like how long did it take", "52:26", "before you could actually walk I have to", "52:28", "broke your foot where I was walking", "52:31", "little too soon oh yeah yeah how long I", "52:33", "didn't I didn't break it I didn't", "52:35", "displace the bones any but I mean I", "52:37", "actually rode I wrote a couple waves", "52:39", "like six weeks later No yeah why would", "52:42", "you do that well because we built this", "52:44", "wave like a up in your Fresno we built a", "52:47", "man-made wave and those a good way to", "52:50", "learn yeah I think well yeah they can be", "52:53", "I mean it depends on how long the wave", "52:55", "laughs and what size wave and how fast", "52:57", "and all that kind of thing but our waves", "52:58", "pretty easy to learn on but it r-wave", "53:01", "lasts on the low speed for a beginner it", "53:03", "lasts like over a minute long now it", "53:05", "seems to me that that would be a great", "53:07", "way to like just get your feet wet yeah", "53:09", "no comment you should come up is that it", "53:11", "right there yeah but that's not the", "53:13", "like the that's the high center yeah", "53:16", "this was and this was actually where is", "53:18", "that like is that it's like 40 minutes", "53:20", "outside area yeah it's a big it used to", "53:23", "be a ski lake so it's long narrow Lake", "53:25", "oh wow that is crazy yeah that's all", "53:29", "man-made this is man-made that's so", "53:31", "weird", "53:32", "this isn't a newest version of it if you", "53:35", "were to Google if you were to search", "53:37", "like there was a contest called we had a", "53:43", "couple of contests we had one called the", "53:44", "surf ranch Pro about six weeks ago and", "53:47", "that's we changed the wave since then", "53:49", "and we remodeled and we had to rebuild", "53:52", "it but anyways the reason I surfed was", "53:56", "because we were having the first", "53:57", "competition at this wave and I wanted to", "53:59", "ride the first wave like oh I didn't", "54:01", "want gonna compete I just like", "54:02", "symbolically I wanted to ride the wave", "54:04", "at the thing so how does this work", "54:07", "what's making that wave this is a oil a", "54:10", "wave foil I could in the back it looks", "54:12", "sometimes you'll see in the back behind", "54:14", "the wave not there but to the left side", "54:16", "more you would see this thing it's a", "54:18", "it's basically a super inefficient boat", "54:20", "hull and it pushes through the water and", "54:22", "so it's pushing water instead of planing", "54:24", "on the water like you would want a boat", "54:25", "to so it's pushing all the water", "54:27", "sideways and it's it's just this foil", "54:29", "shape it's almost like the shape of a", "54:31", "fin or a wing straight up and down in", "54:33", "the water it's that blue thing in the", "54:35", "back and it rides it's like a roller", "54:37", "coaster and it gets pulled on a pulley", "54:40", "system with a four thousand horsepower", "54:42", "engine there's two of them actually you", "54:46", "didn't want to go either direction so", "54:47", "you see it's now they got their back to", "54:49", "the wave when they're riding but their", "54:50", "first few ways I showed you this is", "54:51", "Stephanie Gilmore she's like six time", "54:53", "world champ this is that's me obviously", "54:58", "this was just about six weeks ago in", "55:00", "September and so yeah I mean I I", "55:06", "designed the technology with a scientist", "55:08", "and then design the actual brief bottom", "55:11", "or concrete bottom that makes the wave", "55:13", "break yeah because this seems way more", "55:15", "advanced than the ones that I've seen", "55:16", "yeah this is it's a really advanced wave", "55:19", "it's actually longer than it needs to be", "55:20", "also because at a fast speed the wave", "55:22", "still like 45 seconds and your legs are", "55:24", "fried", "55:24", "this is Felipe Toledo who's number two", "55:27", "in the world right now he's unbelievable", "55:29", "that's pretty fast great surfer where is", "55:32", "he from Brazil a lot of surfers come", "55:35", "from Brazil all the new good guys are", "55:38", "from Brazil it's like the flight Li", "55:39", "fight game you know this is a Gabriel", "55:42", "Medina guy's incredible he's he's", "55:44", "unbelievable whoa", "55:46", "and he's a fucking balance that's great", "55:48", "let's go to shove it yeah and I think", "55:52", "that was a corrupt flip he did super", "55:56", "high-tech moves but he Gabriel Medina's", "55:58", "one time world champ from a few years", "56:00", "ago but I thought he was you know I", "56:03", "thought he was just going to win year", "56:04", "after year after year after his first", "56:05", "title I don't know if it got complacent", "56:08", "or what happened I don't know how they", "56:10", "judge like how do they judge like it's", "56:13", "it's a subjective yeah", "56:15", "that's the probably the tough thing for", "56:16", "our sport but I mean gymnastics is", "56:19", "subjective", "56:20", "ice skating you know that kind of thing", "56:22", "so it's not it's not too different it's", "56:24", "not too dissimilar that so you know the", "56:26", "judges are all good surfers relatively", "56:28", "good surfers maybe not X pros but you", "56:30", "know guys who know what is possible on a", "56:33", "wave and there it's pretty easy for them", "56:37", "to compare apples to oranges a different", "56:39", "person's skills over the other one but", "56:42", "it would be interesting in UFC you know", "56:44", "if if you had judges subjectively", "56:46", "judging not not necessarily like who won", "56:49", "the round or looking at strikeouts but", "56:50", "like whose style did I like how fast and", "56:52", "how much power did he have how did he", "56:54", "link is you know strikes together a", "56:57", "subjective element to it but", "56:59", "unfortunately unlike surfing the UFC's", "57:01", "not comport the judges they're not it's", "57:04", "not comprised of former fighters or more", "57:06", "people that really know a lot which is", "57:07", "which is wrong awful it's totally wrong", "57:10", "it's awful I mean some some surfers", "57:12", "really believe that the judges should", "57:13", "just be X pros that were tor level guys", "57:17", "that make those calls seems like there's", "57:19", "enough of those guys out there there are", "57:21", "there may be but you know getting back", "57:23", "to why that kind of leads me back to", "57:25", "like you asked why guys didn't have the", "57:27", "longevity look people get married have", "57:30", "kids have a life back home all that kind", "57:33", "of stuff so you know I was sort of I", "57:36", "went a knock", "57:37", "the traditional route with all that", "57:39", "stuff so I had a lot more time focused", "57:42", "dedication into what I was doing and I", "57:44", "wanted to do it for a long time because", "57:45", "I just love surfing and I mean if I had", "57:49", "my druthers every day I'm gonna wake up", "57:50", "and go ride waves now is there a point", "57:52", "system with this koron like yep out of", "57:54", "ten out of ten I still like boxing not", "57:58", "everybody gets a nine if they lose that", "58:00", "battle you know it's um ten is the max", "58:02", "tens max but I mean more average you're", "58:04", "seeing threes and fours then you are", "58:06", "eight two nines", "58:07", "because you know it's just a certain", "58:10", "wave and a certain skill set get you up", "58:12", "to that excellent category so we", "58:15", "consider eight and up excellent and you", "58:17", "know sort of six five to eight is like", "58:20", "really good and there's there a lot of", "58:23", "just debate about whether or not a nine", "58:26", "is is is accurate for someone's ride", "58:30", "yeah yeah there is well if if it's early", "58:35", "there's a lot to it you know that like", "58:37", "if it's early in a heat and a guy gets a", "58:39", "nine or girl gets a nine and then you", "58:42", "think that there's a lot more that could", "58:43", "have been done either on that day in", "58:44", "those types of waves and we're on that", "58:46", "wave specifically like some occasionally", "58:49", "you see somebody get ten perfect right", "58:51", "as good as you can possibly do it's the", "58:52", "ultimate you should remember that way", "58:54", "forever kind of thing you know it's like", "58:55", "the perfect knockout but then then won't", "58:59", "right they'll kick off the wave when", "59:00", "there's more to ride or they'll fall and", "59:02", "they still get a ten so like sometimes", "59:05", "you'll see somebody get a really good", "59:06", "score and you know a lot more could have", "59:08", "been done they could have been deeper in", "59:09", "that tube they could have been higher in", "59:10", "that air they could have rotated they", "59:11", "could have you know more they could in", "59:13", "there they could have written out like", "59:15", "smoother they could have linked a couple", "59:17", "different more difficult turns together", "59:20", "added more variety so you you have to", "59:23", "kind of like if anything scaled down I", "59:25", "think as a judge as opposed to scale up", "59:27", "because then you if if you're surfing in", "59:30", "really great waves which makes it easier", "59:32", "to get a good score so like Teahupoo in", "59:34", "Tahiti if you if you pull up Tahiti", "59:39", "Teahupoo te ahu p oo contest 2014 so we", "59:46", "had really unbelievable waves in this", "59:49", "contest", "59:50", "almost every wave look I could be a 10", "59:52", "then it comes down to like how late did", "59:55", "you drop in how critical was that how", "59:56", "deep were you how did you maximize your", "59:58", "time in there by slowing your speed how", "60:01", "much risk did you take so even though", "60:03", "the wave only lasts about five seconds", "60:05", "there's a whole lot that can be", "60:06", "condensed into that five seconds and did", "60:08", "you wait for one of the biggest waves or", "60:10", "did you take a smaller wave and take and", "60:12", "go you know a little bit easier what is", "60:15", "it like when one of those giant tubes", "60:17", "crashes down on top of you yeah so this", "60:20", "gave Madinah he end up winning the", "60:23", "contest it's not super fun when you eat", "60:26", "it you could imagine it I mean you've", "60:29", "probably talked to Shane that's me", "60:30", "actually", "60:31", "yeah I've talked to Shane about it yeah", "60:32", "and I mean look Shane no one's more of", "60:35", "an authority than Shane is maybe not in", "60:38", "this super hollow crazy stuff I mean", "60:40", "whatever Shane rides everything but the", "60:42", "biggest waves in the world change the", "60:43", "authority like he's had wipeouts that he", "60:46", "came close to dying he probably talked", "60:48", "about the vest he created because of", "60:50", "that he almost drowned", "60:51", "he created a vest that you pull the co2", "60:53", "cartridge and it blasts you know this", "60:55", "big bladder and lifts you to the surface", "60:57", "even if you get knocked out or taking", "60:58", "water somebody's gonna find you and", "61:00", "probably save you but yeah this is", "61:03", "that's me there so I didn't make that", "61:06", "but that wasn't even a big one you're", "61:08", "not for that day that was a small wave", "61:10", "fucking huge though when that's coming", "61:12", "down to see where I'm at I'm coming in", "61:13", "blue water right so I was able to dive", "61:15", "and kind of get under and not get sucked", "61:17", "back over so there's a little bit of a", "61:19", "skill that goes with wiping out so you", "61:21", "understand that energy it's you know", "61:23", "it's like a it's like a tornado or like", "61:24", "a hurricane the my wall is the worst but", "61:27", "your fear in the center you're fine", "61:28", "mm-hmm you know I always I've always", "61:30", "wondered like could you follow a", "61:31", "hurricane inside the center of the eye", "61:32", "like could you just stay with it and be", "61:34", "okay but you could if you moved at a", "61:36", "really slow speed right they don't move", "61:38", "that villain is about 10 to 20 miles an", "61:40", "hour right sometimes you last kind of", "61:41", "plane go that slow no but maybe you", "61:44", "could stage a car right behind a flight", "61:46", "now find a really good GPS system you", "61:49", "gotta go northeast yeah okay gonna have", "61:55", "to go off-road yeah or you'll die but so", "61:58", "that energy all that Energy's in where", "61:59", "the lip where the you know if you're in", "62:02", "the center that you're pretty safe but", "62:03", "as soon", "62:03", "get sucked in right into the wall that", "62:05", "and you get pitched in the limb that's", "62:07", "when the lip spreads the water that it", "62:09", "hits and it sends you right down to the", "62:10", "reef especially in a place like this", "62:12", "where it's when you see a way that's", "62:14", "real hollow it's generally a lot", "62:16", "shallower than it is high so the wave", "62:19", "will be 15 feet and the way water might", "62:21", "only be 5 or 6 feet deep so think of all", "62:23", "that energy it's gonna hit most of it's", "62:25", "gonna hit the reef at some point so", "62:28", "that's the you want to you want to try", "62:30", "to kind of fall like where that lips", "62:32", "landing and then escape under it into", "62:34", "blue water what do you do if you know", "62:36", "you're gonna hit a reef you kind of just", "62:38", "brace you don't want to hit your head", "62:40", "you for the most part you can tell up", "62:42", "and down I mean sometimes you lose your", "62:45", "equilibrium a little bit underwater but", "62:46", "for the most part you can tell what is", "62:48", "up and down so you can feel it coming in", "62:50", "I mean I'm gonna put my arms there", "62:51", "before I take it on my head right of", "62:53", "course and so I'm I'm like trying to be", "62:55", "like a cat like when I hit I want to be", "62:57", "able to I'll break my hands or feet or", "62:59", "whatever you know I'm not worried about", "63:00", "that I don't want to get knocked out", "63:01", "right so I think everyone default is to", "63:05", "try to cover your head you know if you", "63:09", "hit anywhere else you're kind of okay", "63:10", "you just don't wanna hit your head and", "63:11", "when the waves come crashing down on you", "63:13", "do you lose your sense of up and down", "63:15", "you can yeah but you know you you also", "63:19", "have your board connected from the leash", "63:21", "and that's usually that's generally", "63:23", "gonna pull up", "63:24", "mm-hmm so you kind of know if you don't", "63:27", "feel your board pulling you're kind of", "63:30", "worried like shit my board might hit me", "63:31", "might spear me underwater you know Brian", "63:33", "you can occasionally get speared in the", "63:35", "face with your board or a fin or", "63:36", "something that's kind of spooky I was", "63:39", "surfing with a guy who was like a big", "63:41", "brother I should travel with Tom Carol", "63:43", "he's a

he", "66:23", "was kind of just floundering around and", "66:25", "then the next wave hit and they never", "66:26", "saw him again", "66:26", "but he was only in surf drunk so they", "66:28", "didn't ever find the body", "66:30", "because he didn't float up but if he", "66:32", "just had even just a wetsuit just some", "66:34", "debris ever found the bomb didn't find", "66:35", "him the waves were

was", "67:49", "actually I'm I think Shane was out there", "67:52", "this day not positive but I'm pretty", "67:54", "sure Shane was out during this session", "67:56", "there's about 15 guys out dozen guys out", "67:58", "and uh Greg took off on a wave and", "68:02", "somebody was in front of him on the wave", "68:05", "which kind of changed his angle a little", "68:06", "bit but he I don't think he would have", "68:08", "made the wave anyhow but it just put him", "68:10", "in a little bit of a precarious", "68:11", "situation and he ate it and was down a", "68:15", "long time this wave has just so much", "68:17", "energy in it because there's nothing", "68:19", "between where the wave started and this", "68:22", "break like it's thousands and thousands", "68:24", "of feet deep that you know over the", "68:25", "whole Pacific so there's no continental", "68:28", "shelf to slow the wave down you know if", "68:30", "you can imagine the East Coast we have", "68:32", "small waves a big

because we have a continental", "68:43", "shelf", "68:43", "that goes you know you go out uh-huh you", "68:45", "can go out 20 miles and it's 70 feet", "68:46", "deep some places so the swells just drag", "68:49", "in the Pacific they don't drag there's", "68:51", "just nothing to get in away so these", "68:54", "walls are going 35 miles an hour when", "68:55", "they hit so it's a lot faster than a", "68:57", "normal wave so there's all this energy", "68:59", "in the wave and so when Greg went down", "69:00", "this wave is probably you know 40-foot", "69:02", "face or whatever 50-foot face he was", "69:05", "underwater and he's really calm he's you", "69:07", "know he's probably as as ready for", "69:10", "anybody in big surf he's totally", "69:11", "prepared he's done all the CPR and", "69:13", "breathing courses and everything and he", "69:16", "was real calm and he said he pulled his", "69:17", "vest and it didn't work and then he", "69:19", "pulled another one in it didn't work and", "69:22", "he pulled it a third time and it didn't", "69:23", "work and so he was like oh fuck I'm", "69:26", "screwed you know that kind of thing but", "69:28", "he at that point you're when you start", "69:30", "to pull it you're already in a little", "69:32", "bit of a sum some guys pull it right", "69:34", "away just to be safe on a big wave but", "69:37", "some guys kind of wait and go I'll see", "69:38", "if I'm able to pull this one off and", "69:40", "I'll save my little canister because you", "69:41", "only have like some of the vests have", "69:44", "two or two canisters some have four so", "69:46", "you don't have to go change your", "69:48", "canisters over so if you're thinking", "69:50", "gonna make that you're gonna get back to", "69:52", "the surface or you're okay you can", "69:53", "handle it you got a good breath you're", "69:55", "like I'll just I won't pull it but he", "69:56", "pulled three times and then he blacked", "69:58", "out and they luckily had really good", "70:02", "water safety crew and I don't know that", "70:06", "it was his brother that saved him but a", "70:07", "couple of guys went and grabbed Dovan", "70:09", "and pulled him up by the leash Wow", "70:11", "luckily he was to the leash because he", "70:13", "wasn't floating because he didn't have", "70:14", "the co2 and then he had taken a lot of", "70:17", "water and uh they had to airlift him off", "70:20", "the boat in high in big seas that night", "70:23", "after dark Wow and got him back to the", "70:26", "mainland so did they do CPR on him they", "70:28", "did CPR

croc yeah", "77:52", "like they keep a track like you know", "77:55", "they're pretty vigilant about how where", "77:57", "they are what rivers they would because", "77:59", "I get a warn people like don't swim here", "78:01", "some people don't listen they're stupid", "78:03", "they die but like a Crocs not gonna just", "78:05", "sort of give you an exploratory bite", "78:07", "like a great white

they're gonna there", "78:16", "was a horrible story that I read it I", "78:17", "think it was in National Geographic", "78:18", "about this these two people that were", "78:20", "kayaking in a river in Africa and this", "78:23", "guy was guy went with him did you this", "78:26", "might be a different story I don't know", "78:27", "what story did you hear this one was", "78:29", "like these two guys were gonna do a", "78:30", "first descent down this thing and they", "78:32", "were contacting another guy who had done", "78:34", "that River an American guy mhm and the", "78:36", "American guy was like I can't miss this", "78:38", "descent I gotta do this", "78:39", "I got to do that whole river and then", "78:41", "the three of them got into this zone", "78:43", "where there was just Crocs everywhere", "78:45", "and the river was real slow and wide and", "78:46", "as soon as they got there all the rivers", "78:49", "all the Crocs came off the riverbank and", "78:51", "they were like oh shit there's like tons", "78:53", "of oh and this guy's theory was to take", "78:55", "his helmet and throw it off to the side", "78:56", "so it would be like movement and", "78:58", "distract them and they'd attack that and", "78:59", "he paddle up the shore and all three of", "79:02", "them got together and the American guy", "79:03", "was on the right side and the oldest you", "79:05", "guys were yeah then they were so close", "79:06", "they could like the guy in the middle of", "79:07", "I couldn't really paddle he was just", "79:09", "kind of like you know trying to move", "79:11",
