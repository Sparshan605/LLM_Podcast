"I think is kind of natural is at least", "24:01", "for my experience is like I don't know", "24:04", "if you ever go through this when you go", "24:05", "home I'll little go out and surf for", "24:09", "many hours like he can go on for five", "24:11", "hours at a time and if their surf and it", "24:13", "comes home and I see how happy he is", "24:15", "like to see us like", "24:17", "loves

I", "24:55", "always get amused a little bit by the", "24:57", "push/pull yeah well especially I think", "25:00", "with the big wave surfer mindset a good", "25:03", "type of person those are like some of", "25:05", "the freest wildest humans on the planet", "25:08", "it's a very unusual group of people that", "25:11", "rides giant waves of water on the top of", "25:14", "the ocean I mean that's a that's a crazy", "25:16", "thing to dedicate your time to think", "25:20", "about it I tried not to think too much", "25:21", "about it cuz I did marry him but there's", "25:25", "some stuff I mean and weirdly you know", "25:28", "he's been doing this so long that you", "25:30", "realize hit he's actually even more", "25:32", "different than some of the other guys", "25:34", "because if you think about it he's", "25:37", "sustained doing this for right now forty", "25:40", "years so he's a guy who he has both so", "25:46", "what he wants to do is write a huge wave", "25:47", "during the day and then be with his", "25:49", "family at night and sometimes you know", "25:50", "it would take going you know halfway", "25:52", "around the globe or whatever and so I", "25:55", "think the pursuit and they have to wait", "25:58", "a lot that's the other thing these", "26:00", "things don't come around that often", "26:02", "right it's it's very interesting to live", "26:06", "with because there's a there's a little", "26:10", "bit of suffering that goes on and", "26:12", "sometimes Laird will say to me because", "26:13", "he's aware of time going by he'll be", "26:15", "like you know I have a lot more waves I", "26:16", "need to ride and I'm like I know like", "26:18", "it's a pretty deep calling and now that", "26:23", "I mean he's been filing for 25 years but", "26:25", "now that they are getting that equipment", "26:26", "better it's sort of like now we can ride", "26:29", "places that we couldn't", "26:31", "that we're not really attractive for", "26:33", "riding on top of the surface of the", "26:35", "water even if you towed it so now it's", "26:38", "opened up a whole other pursuit for him", "26:41", "yeah it's very nice as to why you would", "26:43", "go towards that like lair just put me on", "26:47", "a ski in front of a wave that's like 60", "26:49", "feet right and like being on the back of", "26:52", "a ski with him driving there's a moment", "26:55", "where you go okay I actually and I'm", "26:57", "sure you've experienced this with other", "26:58", "friends that take you maybe on flying or", "27:00", "something he is this is what he does", "27:03", "right so I'm like okay I trust him more", "27:06", "than I'm afraid that's fine I can do", "27:08", "that and I'm gonna surrender to that I'm", "27:10", "not gonna torture myself the whole time", "27:12", "I'm just gonna trust him", "27:13", "and you turn and there's a six story", "27:15", "building behind you moving and you just", "27:19", "think who would who like how is that fun", "27:22", "knowing how is seeing like I'm going to", "27:28", "actively ride that but now what the", "27:33", "foils because they're actually catching", "27:34", "the energy below the surface of the", "27:35", "water", "27:36", "what's up foils I'm not they have these", "27:38", "things called Hydra foils so originally", "27:41", "there's a guy named Mike Murphy who", "27:43", "created something called the air chair", "27:44", "and they were they've been putting foils", "27:46", "on like water skis and different funky", "27:49", "ways like even in the 50s so Laird and", "27:51", "his friends got an air tear and cut the", "27:53", "chair off and put us snowboard boots", "27:58", "bindings quick-release so you stand on", "28:01", "it you're booted in and below is this", "28:02", "basically a mini airplane with a strut", "28:05", "so for example yeah there's a shot of", "28:08", "one and this is a smaller one Jamie do", "28:10", "you have any ones have the big with the", "28:11", "boots I think this is what people are", "28:14", "using did you know what about this Wow", "28:19", "he knows about everything what are you", "28:20", "talking about he's plugged in his", "28:22", "plugged in look at him you have a", "28:25", "girlfriend", "28:26", "well what happened to this dude's head", "28:28", "oh yeah", "28:29", "so there's Laird on the left obviously", "28:31", "so you see how he there in the boots and", "28:33", "also he the reason he looks so puffy is", "28:36", "he has floatation underneath his wetsuit", "28:39", "so if you hit your head or what have you", "28:41", "but it's basically a miniature", "28:44", "airplane underneath the surface and if", "28:47", "he gets into trouble if they wiped out", "28:49", "they have a quick release but now", "28:51", "they've gotten this developed so that he", "28:54", "can do it without the boots because that", "28:58", "adds an element of danger that because", "29:00", "you're strapped in you're strapped in", "29:02", "and you're strut is you know four feet", "29:05", "long you know that's so strange looking", "29:08", "yeah but what's going on below the", "29:11", "surface so there's a miniature airplane", "29:13", "do you have Jamie do have any pictures", "29:14", "of it flipped up I'm sure if you look on", "29:16", "Laird stuff you can see the bottom it's", "29:18", "like a miniature airplane because water", "29:20", "is denser than air so it's sort of like", "29:22", "a miniature plane and it is like the", "29:25", "Oracle guys that do those boats do have", "29:27", "made foils for Laird it's yeah so those", "29:31", "are kind of more low performance ones", "29:35", "when you see the high performance they I", "29:37", "mean you know aerodynamics hydrodynamics", "29:41", "it's all of that so now what you're", "29:44", "doing is because there's energy below", "29:46", "the surface moving so we think of a wave", "29:49", "like pushing and dropping but there's", "29:51", "actually the energy circular energy", "29:53", "below so now you've got the foil that", "29:55", "can ride that but you're not you don't", "29:56", "have drag so like they can go there's a", "29:59", "wave on kawaiii where they're going over", "30:02", "you know 50 they go about 50 they can go", "30:04", "up get up to 52 miles an hour so imagine", "30:09", "if you did something well you've you", "30:10", "know dedicated yourself to martial arts", "30:12", "it's like but then there's like a new", "30:14", "way to do it and so he's been doing the", "30:17", "big stuff for 25 years but now they're", "30:20", "getting the equipment right that he can", "30:21", "ride ways that actually wouldn't be that", "30:24", "great but now they're super fun oh wow", "30:27", "so he gets it makes him excited and he", "30:29", "still pursues it and that's how that's", "30:32", "on Kauai right there and see how it's", "30:34", "not even breaking where he rides it yeah", "30:36", "so it no drug correct and it's it's", "30:39", "actually riding the energy below the", "30:42", "surface which you know for him he's just", "30:45", "interested in what's the most efficient", "30:48", "way I mean look at that you'd never", "30:49", "entered in regular surfing be able to", "30:54", "ride that", "30:56", "so it enables them so much fun you're", "31:00", "flying", "31:00", "that's incredible that's what it's the", "31:03", "difference right so they're flying so", "31:04", "that's I think keep kept him interested", "31:06", "but you know his his pursuit of this is", "31:10", "it's pretty it's pretty it's a pretty", "31:15", "interesting relationship to watch I", "31:17", "think it's important I mean as a female", "31:20", "for me I think playing volleyball help", "31:23", "me understand like having a pursuit you", "31:25", "know like something like you I got to go", "31:28", "do that and I think it's something about", "31:30", "living with a person who has a pursuit", "31:32", "other than like I need a bigger war", "31:36", "chest or whatever right that's can be", "31:39", "really cool is when when you're riding", "31:43", "that thing and there's the little", "31:46", "airplane under the water is there any", "31:47", "risk of something thinking that airplane", "31:49", "is a fish no animals are pretty smart oh", "31:54", "yeah I know I think I mean I know sharks", "31:57", "don't have great vision and I think", "31:59", "Laird is you know hit a home a turtle", "32:03", "you know not got anything but I like", "32:05", "Gray's did or something", "32:07", "but those animals are pretty smart right", "32:10", "but I was thinking the Sharks know", "32:11", "that's what I mean like maybe a Marlin", "32:15", "that thinks it's fish yes jacket I don't", "32:17", "think they want to have anything to do", "32:19", "with that thing though just the speed", "32:21", "and the shape and also a lot of those", "32:24", "animals don't want to get in that", "32:25", "turbulent it's still near a wave but you", "32:28", "know what maybe you never know and if I", "32:31", "hear of a story I will definitely call", "32:33", "you and tell you because I'll be like", "32:35", "Marlin came out but those guys are smart", "32:37", "all those animals Marlins are smart whoa", "32:40", "I mean they know usually I know sharks", "32:42", "again don't have great sight but they're", "32:44", "not like huh I think they understand", "32:47", "what's most times what's food obviously", "32:50", "shiny things and things like that but", "32:52", "but there are instances of people", "32:54", "getting hit by sharks right and Hawaii's", "32:56", "a big one isn't it it's worse as far as", "33:00", "like more in South Africa's really a lot", "33:03", "of sharks no Hawaii has there for sure", "33:05", "but nothing crazy", "33:09", "I there's a story that happened like", "33:11", "three weeks ago on Kauai in Hanalei Bay", "33:13", "this guy great surfer finishes his ride", "33:15", "jumps off his board and jumped onto a", "33:18", "shark oh Jesus Christ", "33:19", "and a shark like turned I guess and sort", "33:23", "of grunt he was a firefighter this guy", "33:24", "and like graze his leg and split and I", "33:28", "think it's just a reminder that sharks", "33:31", "ultimately really don't want to have", "33:32", "anything to do with you", "33:33", "I mean maybe hammerheads may be a little", "33:35", "more aggressive bull shark is the most", "33:36", "because I think right they have the most", "33:38", "amount of testosterone of any animal", "33:40", "mm-hmm they're the ones that can go to", "33:42", "freshwater - yeah the Bulls so they're", "33:44", "sort of more actively aggressive but I", "33:47", "mean I don't think a shark you're not", "33:49", "good eating I watch the television show", "33:51", "they took they found bull sharks way up", "33:54", "the Illinois River that'd be scary", "33:56", "whatever river it is in Illinois I know", "33:58", "what river it is but they found him deep", "34:00", "in freshwater yeah these sharks make", "34:03", "their way all the way from the ocean and", "34:05", "then Jamie do you think about the", "34:06", "testosterone I think of any animal they", "34:08", "have the largest amount of testosterone", "34:09", "or something like that they're mean", "34:11", "little fuckers yeah

a warehouse and I taught a class", "59:48", "three days a week for free a dollar so", "59:51", "they were comforted under my insurance", "59:53", "because we have so little training like", "59:56", "we have we have acts we have a gym and", "59:58", "stuff but like the community on the", "60:00", "north then really so I started doing", "60:03", "that like three days a week to get", "60:05",

to", "60:41", "the other parts of the world I mean in", "60:42", "its remote like you're out there it's I", "60:45", "think besides Easter Island it's like", "60:46", "the most remote place in the world Wow", "60:49", "yeah really that's interesting what", "60:52", "makes sense yeah yeah it's far I mean", "60:55", "you know they navigated there and they", "60:58", "said that the water sea level was lower", "61:00", "so that they could see more land mm-hmm", "61:02", "when the Polynesians sailed there but", "61:04", "it's pretty uh it's a pretty interesting", "61:08", "contrast to living like in Malibu yeah", "61:11", "but then in a way not because you're", "61:12", "surrounded by nature right yeah I think", "61:16", "it's probably a far more healthy way to", "61:18", "live I just I just know that a lot of", "61:20", "people do get that Island fever and they", "61:21", "can't take it they want to get the fuck", "61:23", "off yeah and like if when you have a", "61:25", "family like

terms of like the amount of", "61:42", "stress that you experience and the", "61:44", "beauty of nature is very calming and", "61:46", "soothing and probably therapeutic and", "61:48", "beneficial yeah but it's that reminder I", "61:52", "mean this has been thing for me it's", "61:54", "like you could have all that at your", "61:56", "access but if you're not if you haven't", "61:59", "dealt with yourself or you're hunting if", "62:00", "you're feel miserable", "62:02", "it sort of doesn't really matter and I", "62:04", "think that that kind of place points it", "62:06", "out really quick where when you live in", "62:08", "a busy place you can distract yourself", "62:09", "from yourself and you can be like oh", "62:12", "there's traffic and I have stuff to do", "62:13", "and I'm busy I'm a busy person I'm at an", "62:15", "office I do all the stuff and when", "62:17", "you're there you can't blame really the", "62:20", "traffic you can you sort of have to go", "62:22", "oh that's

they get the hang of it but I think", "129:21", "it's it's pretty special the training", "129:25", "because you when you're done again it", "129:28", "goes back to I am like a noodle you're",

"130:22", "like there's all these ways to adapt and", "130:24", "it's pretty cool I think for people who", "130:26", "train that's the whole thing is how do", "130:28", "you keep modifying like do you

perfect", "144:34", "you know like there's been time so it", "144:36", "was like maybe we're not gonna stay", "144:37", "together and I guess for me that would", "144:39", "be really interesting is to communicate", "144:41", "in a way that's like it's not gratuitous", "144:43", "but at least like hey you're being kind", "144:46", "of honest about like what it is yeah you", "144:49", "know and and and now like I'm almost 50", "144:53", "it's like even aging like having or", "144:56", "having a realistic but good conversation", "144:59", "about like hey how's that going you know", "145:01", "not

and I said I", "145:20", "said today I it was funny I had a thing", "145:22", "like I realized like times moving and he", "145:25", "goes mm-hmm because he knows what that", "145:28", "means", "145:28", "and I'm sparing him that whole", "145:30", "conversation like a girlfriend", "145:32", "conversation that's like not one that", "145:34", "you have with your partner I think it's", "145:35", "important to like you know go down the", "145:38", "hole with him on other things right", "145:40", "I do observe that sometimes I look", "145:42", "outside I go yeah this is not a",

probably", "146:04", "cuz you think about yourself so much", "146:06", "you're probably annoyed that you're", "146:07", "thinking about yourself you wanna fix", "146:09", "this and change that and adapt here and", "146:12", "evolve there you know if you're really", "146:15", "paying attention why it was even a", "146:16", "decent athlete is this like I was just", "146:18", "trying to I was just

"146:29", "be one's best self in the ISM is", "146:33", "probably worth spending some time on you", "146:38", "you appreciate your existence more I", "146:40", "think when you are on that path I think", "146:43", "so and I think I think especially when", "146:46", "you've had the opportunity also to do a", "146:47", "lot of really cool stuff I almost think", "146:50", "it becomes a

well it", "147:31", "does but I really think that there's", "147:33", "value in expressing that and that you", "147:36", "know yes I do yeah", "147:38", "I'm sure a lot of people are agreeing", "147:39", "right now like yeah do a podcast you", "147:42", "know what it is this is what I might", "147:43", "ultimately be is that somehow and this", "147:46", "is I think why I love your your
