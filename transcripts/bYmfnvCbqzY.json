around while you're walking", "154:06", "in the room yeah yeah you know that's", "154:09", "good point it had an effect", "154:11", "I guarantee would have an effect but it", "154:13", "uestion is would it have enough of an", "154:15", "effect that it would fuck his legs up to", "154:17", "the point where he couldn't recover", "154:19", "maybe maybe it's valid the only the only", "154:23",

now", "154:56", "think about how long we gonna have this", "154:58", "huh fuck this mm-hmm let's just go out", "155:00", "there norm on me guarantee you next time", "155:02", "seem he's gonna be

he's", "155:39", "been many many many times just that he", "155:41", "was the destroyer but all the lead-up to", "155:43", "I mean anticipation fucks with", "155:45", "everybody's head yeah I think Deonte", "155:48", "would be better than ever for the next", "155:49", "fight the question is if Tyson Fury", "155:51", "fights in that same way and stays on him", "155:53", "can he beat that Tyson

got to give the Deontay Wilder the", "156:20", "remaining ten rounds are not in dispute", "156:22", "the remaining ten rounds went to Tyson", "156:25", "Fury so if you just look at it on paper", "156:27", "he should won that fight although most", "156:29", "people weren't upset with the decision", "156:32", "because Deonte almost had them out and", "156:35", "it's like it's exciting let's do a", "156:37", "rematch no big deal but then in the", "156:39", "rematch Tyson Fury just took the judges", "156:42", "out of the fucking equation that was", "156:44", "bombed on them it's really unfortunate", "156:46", "that there is a question of whether or", "156:49", "not that big stupid suit was wearing his", "156:52", "legs out because if that really is the", "156:53", "case that bums me out man", "156:55", "that's what he said but I was thinking", "157:00", "it was a joke until you told me that it", "157:02", "was like he wore it for 20 minutes then", "157:03", "I was like home yeah", "157:04", "well that would be different that's", "157:07", "different that's real weight you know", "157:09", "just put it on you walked out there for", "157:11", "30 seconds yeah this 40-pound
