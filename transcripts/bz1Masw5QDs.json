"not offended by things that are", "01:47", "important and not important so we're", "01:49", "another strangest time the beauty of", "01:52", "that is most the time I was serving so", "01:54", "it paid zero attention to any of it", "01:56", "right the disaster part of that is when", "01:58", "you come off the off-ramp you know out", "02:00", "of service yeah and you go what happened", "02:03", "yeah what happened to the environment", "02:05", "that I left but I mean I went from Santa", "02:07", "Cruz California where I grew up where it", "02:10", "could well be the origin of", "02:12",

where I started and then", "02:25", "what I was seeing when I came out well", "02:26", "that's the that's the take that I always", "02:28", "see from people that are in the military", "02:31", "or have been in the military is their", "02:33", "understanding what's important and not", "02:34", "important it's so much different because", "02:37", "it's truly life-and-death not all the", "02:40",

me", "03:20", "like that book that one of the most", "03:22", "moving part of it was how connected", "03:25", "these people are when they're together", "03:27", "and when they're at war and what that", "03:29", "Brotherhood that camaraderie means to", "03:32", "them and how they feel disconnected when", "03:35", "they're back in regular civilization and", "03:38", "they get depressed it's

much dedication", "03:51", "so much commitment and then to go back", "03:53", "to the regular life is very very", "03:55", "difficult for a lot of people yeah I", "03:57", "don't think it would be unfair to say", "03:59", "that some of the people that I served", "04:01", "with I probably have closer", "04:03", "relationships than I do with my", "04:05", "biological family even probably I've",

understands it she gets", "04:26", "it you're gonna get in trouble bro", "04:27", "that's well I only get in trouble for my", "04:30", "wife on days that end in Y so nothing", "04:32", "that's gonna be new about that but but I", "04:34", "think she also understands that because", "04:36", "I certainly have struggled I struggled", "04:38", "quite a bit but about the first eighteen", "04:40", "months I got out of the military and I", "04:42", "look back on it now and I think two", "04:45", "pieces of it one I went from seeing", "04:47", "those people that I share those", "04:48", "experiences with on a daily basis so", "04:50", "there's that everything you have in", "04:53", "common we talk about stuff the same I", "04:55", "mean I just know the ins and outs of", "04:56", "those people then I became detached from", "04:57", "them and then I had I used to have what", "04:59", "I thought was a job that had an immense", "05:01", "amount of purpose and then that was gone", "05:03", "too so I lost a little bit of my", "05:04", "identity and a little bit of the purpose", "05:05", "and at that same time like I said I come", "05:09", "off that off-ramp of being in the", "05:10", "military and I'm looking at the world it", "05:12", "doesn't make any sense to me at all", "05:13", "people are arguing about things and", "05:16", "talking about how they're oppressed",

"05:34", "environment well especially in your", "05:36", "situation you were wounded and you you", "05:39", "know although you wanted to continue", "05:40", "serving you physically weren't able to", "05:42", "anything I was for a while so I got hurt", "05:44", "in February of 2005 the 14-year 15 year", "05:49", "now 14 year anniversary was earlier this", "05:51", "month and it took me about two years to", "05:55", "work my way back to where I would become", "05:58", "operational again and I did one more", "05:59", "deployment after I got hurt and then at", "06:01", "the tail end of that deployment that was", "06:02", "just the end of it my body wouldn't", "06:03", "tolerate it anymore and this is because", "06:05", "of the metal fragments or wood it what", "06:08", "is it totally you there was a nerve", "06:09", "damage", "06:10", "it was the so I got medically retired", "06:13", "which is not based off of any one", "06:16", "instant hopefully I mean people who have", "06:18", "they get an AED strike and they'll", "06:20", "become a quad amputee or a triple", "06:23", "amputee that's one incident that they're", "06:25", "gonna get retired for for me it was more", "06:27", "the culmination of a lot of things so", "06:29", "the gunshot wound obviously didn't help", "06:32", "and then the operational history of", "06:37", "exposure to explosive blasts the", "06:39", "concussive forces all of those things", "06:41", "just kind of added up I went through a", "06:43", "30-day protocol where they baseline me", "06:46", "and took a bunch of tests and basically", "06:48", "came to the you know they write out a", "06:49", "massive document of all the things they", "06:52", "were able to at least document like for", "06:55", "me I can't get an MRI because I still", "06:56", "have metal in my body from ferrous metal", "06:58", "from the round that clipped a piece of", "07:00", "rebar on its way to me oh wow", "07:02", "and it clipped my sciatic nerve on the", "07:04", "way in and they're concerned that if", "07:06", "they image me or what I've been told by", "07:07", "the doctors if they image me it might", "07:09", "react again with my sciatic nerve just", "07:11", "pull a piece of metal by it and I'll be", "07:13", "right back where I was all I had drop", "07:14", "foot for about six months", "07:16", "and the drop foot is when your foot just", "07:18", "stops were totally hangs I could always", "07:20", "push down but I couldn't lift it up", "07:22", "that's the thing that's happening now in", "07:23", "MMA quite a bit it's happened several", "07:25", "times so guys get low calf kicked and", "07:27", "there's something about chopping at the", "07:30", "the nerves behind the leg that guy's", "07:33", "legs are just their foots going limp it", "07:34", "happened to Michael Chandler it happened", "07:37", "to Henry so who know are they recovering", "07:39", "from it yeah yeah I mean it's in the", "07:40", "middle of the fight so and then", "07:43", "momentary leg just stops working and", "07:45", "they can't stand on it their foot just", "07:47", "this literally doesn't react anymore so", "07:50", "frustrating so for me I got I got shot", "07:54", "in the hip high up on my left hand side", "07:56", "but by the time I made it to the", "07:58", "hospital my single complaint was my", "07:59", "ankle I was to tell me that like I I", "08:02", "didn't remember falling on my ankle I", "08:03", "didn't remember hitting my ankle but it", "08:05", "felt like somebody had taken a", "08:06", "sledgehammer and just beat it into", "08:07", "powder and so they were very careful and", "08:11", "then you know they cut my shoes off of", "08:12", "me they cut my pants off me and they the", "08:14", "first thing I did was take a x-ray of my", "08:16", "ankle no I dude you're totally fine but", "08:18", "it felt like it was destroyed because it", "08:19", "was the nerve they got interacted with", "08:22", "high up it's short-circuiting all the", "08:24", "way down to the terminal point of the", "08:26", "nerve and for me it never came back I'm", "08:28", "hoping that obviously for the fighters", "08:30", "it eventually comes back because I had", "08:32", "dropped foot for six months to a year", "08:34", "I eventually was able to start dorsal", "08:37", "flexing my foot again but I still can't", "08:40", "feel my left leg from the knee cap down", "08:42", "on the side excited the far left hand", "08:44", "side and as it wraps over the top of my", "08:46", "foot is completely numb and is this", "08:47", "because of the actual damage to the", "08:49", "nerve", "08:50", "or something touching the nerve they", "08:51", "don't know that was an interesting part", "08:53", "of being hurt as well is talking to", "08:56", "people who have decades of medical", "08:58", "experience and having them look at you", "09:00", "and go I don't know", "09:01", "fuck yeah especially without an MRI", "09:03", "right because they can't they can't in", "09:05", "there because they're worried about it", "09:06", "being pulled out same thing why the", "09:08", "concussion history that I have it's an", "09:11", "estimate based off of operational", "09:13", "history because they can't throw me in", "09:14", "that same machine and image my brain oh", "09:16", "whoa it's spitting magnets and right I", "09:19", "made it and then there's metal all over", "09:21", "the left hand side of my pelvis and I", "09:23", "don't know how much it would have to", "09:24", "move but if it just clipped that nerve", "09:26", "again I mean it was probably one of the", "09:29", "more difficult times in my life my leg", "09:31", "felt like it was on fire 24 hours a day", "09:34", "Oh which I could ignore during the", "09:36", "daytime but where it got me was at", "09:37", "nighttime I would lay down in bed and it", "09:40", "just felt like I had dipped my leg and", "09:41", "gas and just and put a lighter onto it", "09:43", "so I was on high dosages of like", "09:46", "gabapentin and rotten which our central", "09:49", "nervous system suppressors so I started", "09:51", "feeling the cognitive effect of that so", "09:53", "I backed myself off of that wasn't in a", "09:56", "great phase of my life so I was of", "09:58", "course washing those down with massive", "10:00", "amounts of alcohol taking three to four", "10:02", "ambien staying awake because my", "10:04", "tolerance to all that stuff was so high", "10:06", "and the last thing I ever want to do is", "10:08", "go through that again so I'm gonna stay", "10:10", "away from the spinning magnets it's just", "10:12", "I mean it might be a quarter of an inch", "10:15", "and I'd be exactly right back where I", "10:16", "was before and there's no way they can", "10:18", "go in and pull those fragments out so my", "10:22", "I'm laying in the hospital in Baghdad", "10:25", "and the night that I got hurt many other", "10:29", "people got hurt eight people got hurt on", "10:31", "that particular target I was one of the", "10:34", "least injured there were people who", "10:36", "immediately flown into surgery a guy", "10:37", "almost lost his arm", "10:39", "a guy took a he was right next to an", "10:42", "explosive blast that literally peeled", "10:43", "back the layers of his ballistic helmet", "10:45", "he was conscious but blind he'd taken", "10:48", "such a shot to his head he ejected out", "10:50", "the back side of a building there was", "10:52", "some other gunshot wounds so I'm laying", "10:55", "in the hospital bed I hadn't taken any", "10:57", "morphine because I had watched too many", "10:58", "movies and I thought if I had", "11:00", "auto-injector syrettes on me at all", "11:01", "times but I thought", "11:02", "job myself I was gonna start drooling no", "11:05", "experience with whatsoever and the", "11:07", "doctors finally start working on me and", "11:11", "he says all right you know I'm we're", "11:13", "gonna take a look at this I'm gonna you", "11:15", "know I'm gonna basically stick my finger", "11:17", "in the hole with this take a pause here", "11:19", "sir can I have some pain medication so", "11:22", "he comes out and just juices me with", "11:23", "morphine first time I've ever had it was", "11:25", "I wish I would have taken it in the", "11:26", "field it did almost nothing and they", "11:30", "played around a little bit with the", "11:31", "holes and then slipped me into an x-ray", "11:33", "machine and said do you want us to try", "11:37", "to take this out and I said well what", "11:38", "does that can entail and he said well", "11:40", "because we can tell that there's ferrous", "11:41", "metal in here what we would do is we", "11:43", "would knock you out put a tube down your", "11:45", "throat lay you on your stomach and hold", "11:47", "up a two dimensional x-ray and basically", "11:49", "just start slicing and pulling apart", "11:50", "slicing and pulling apart looking and", "11:52", "searching for these metal pieces and", "11:54", "pulling them out of your body one at a", "11:55", "time and I said is there another option", "11:59", "he's like oh yeah totally the body will", "12:01", "encapsulate it in calcium and as long as", "12:03", "it's not touching a bone you're probably", "12:04", "gonna be fine fuck man why didn't you", "12:07", "lead with that option right well did", "12:09", "they think they were gonna be able to", "12:10", "get them all out though if they did go", "12:11", "in there and start slicing away I don't", "12:13", "know and I don't know what benefit it", "12:16", "would have had I suspect it would have", "12:17", "caused more damage hmm than the actual", "12:19", "injury itself my hip is fine I still", "12:23", "have never had a surgery I've still", "12:24", "never broken a bone the only thing they", "12:26", "ever did was put a gauze pad on my leg", "12:28", "and when the scab fell off I could start", "12:30", "taking a bath again if I wanted to Wow", "12:32", "yep they just left everything in there", "12:34", "Jesus that's crazy it's all covered", "12:38", "Bazaar Wow so if you do have an injury", "12:42", "now that it's is it a lot of guesswork", "12:43", "like if something's wrong with your leg", "12:45", "do they have to like go in there with a", "12:46", "scope like since you can't get an MRI", "12:49", "like what if you blew your knee out they", "12:51", "would have to rely on imagery technology", "12:54", "that doesn't revolve around magnets so", "12:57", "most likely I'm not - I think they gave", "13:00", "me a cat scan in the hospital so that I", "13:02", "don't think is magnet based and then", "13:04", "two-dimensional x-ray well it's", "13:06", "interesting too because some of the", "13:07", "therapies they're using on people for", "13:09", "TBI is magnets yeah but I don't think", "13:13", "they're as powerful as an MRI I mean you", "13:15", "can't even wear earrings", "13:16", "those rooms we get with an MRI I've", "13:18", "heard about some kid who accidentally", "13:19", "died because they had an oxygen tank in", "13:21", "the room they turned the machine on the", "13:22", "tanks slammed into him and crushed him", "13:25", "yeah I've heard about the TBI magnets", "13:28", "that I think I would be fine with", "13:29", "because I don't think it has the power", "13:31", "the that the huge machines do right", "13:34", "right", "13:34", "it's yeah it's like a low-frequency", "13:36", "magnetic pulse that's like cat Zingano", "13:38", "who's a UFC fighter she essentially was", "13:41", "she was she had been hurt and really bad", "13:44", "in a fight with Amanda Nunez and she got", "13:47", "hypothyroid condition from that fight", "13:50", "her thyroid wasn't functioning correctly", "13:52", "she was gaining weight like crazy she", "13:54", "was her motor skills were all fucked up", "13:56", "and they fixed her with that and that", "13:58", "was from the brain injury mm-hmm yeah", "14:00", "for a fight she won which is crazy I", "14:04", "mean she was hurt really bad in the", "14:05", "first round stopped her in the third", "14:07", "round she won the fight she beat Amanda", "14:09", "Nunez and you know really suffered some", "14:11", "significant brain trauma from that fight", "14:13", "there is a I don't want to say there's a", "14:16", "rash of suicides in the SEAL team", "14:22", "specifically obviously the number 22 is", "14:24", "throwing out a lot when it comes to", "14:25", "veteran suicides but that's what is it", "14:27", "22% 22 veterans a day I said is the", "14:31", "number that is often touted I am", "14:34", "hesitant to say that number is accurate", "14:36", "because if you look at how it was", "14:37", "derived it wasn't they could have done a", "14:40", "better job of getting that number and I", "14:42", "and I don't want to say inside of the", "14:44", "SEAL Teams that there's a suicide issue", "14:46", "even though I do know a few people that", "14:49", "have committed suicide and they were the", "14:51", "ones that I would least expect it from", "14:53", "but they were also the ones who had", "14:55", "quite a bit of high operational tempo", "14:59", "and the one thing that I don't think", "15:01", "especially in the military medicine", "15:03", "world they understand well as traumatic", "15:04", "brain injury and the impact it has", "15:06", "long-term yeah and how easy it can be", "15:08", "because you know this I've heard you", "15:10", "talk about it before you don't have to", "15:11", "get knocked out to get a brain injury", "15:12", "right and I know I've countless times", "15:16", "where I either did something dumb or was", "15:18", "just standing in the wrong place or had", "15:21", "a hard parachute opening and I cracked", "15:22", "my head against the metal risers and", "15:24", "your head hurts for the rest of the day", "15:25", "yeah", "15:26", "and it's I've seen the change in", "15:30", "behavior in some people and I know the", "15:33", "stuff that's tied to it as well the low", "15:35", "hormones all of that stuff there that is", "15:37", "happening I think at the highest levels", "15:39", "in the military probably military why", "15:41", "but specifically those people who were", "15:43", "kind of more on the front leading edge", "15:44", "of combat operations and I think as a", "15:47", "country were in a word a total unknown", "15:49", "area because we're in a sustained period", "15:52", "of war long and we've ever been as a", "15:54", "nation and nobody knows the outcome of", "15:56", "that and people who I would have never", "15:59", "guessed would make the decision to take", "16:02", "their own life I'll get a text and pay", "16:05", "you know so-and-so just went out into", "16:07", "the woods and it no other external", "16:11", "injury no other marker than obviously", "16:14", "something happened in the geometry", "16:15", "between their ears that caused them to", "16:17", "make that decision and I suspect it's", "16:18", "from the repeated exposure to the brain", "16:21",

sounds worse than it is", "27:44", "and before I had my first cutaway it was", "27:46", "terrifying and then after you have four", "27:48", "or five you're like okay I got this you", "27:49", "had four or five main parachutes fail I", "27:52", "think I'm at about seven well I've been", "27:56", "jumping for twenty years I started", "28:02", "jumping in 99 statistically I'm actually", "28:06",

not just by looking at the", "28:31", "shape by sometimes listening to it and", "28:34", "just seeing how it opens sometimes I", "28:37", "mean so packing a parachute people think", "28:39", "is really difficult if you can fold a", "28:40", "t-shirt you can pack a parachute", "28:42", "sometimes though you you know you just", "28:45", "get off of a jump and you only have", "28:46", "minutes to make the next jump so you", "28:48", "skip a few steps or you rush through a", "28:50", "few steps is that what happened with you", "28:52", "potentially I may have skipped all of", "28:55", "the non-essential steps and a few of the", "28:57", "essential steps to get the parachute", "28:59", "really", "29:00", "I was just rushing and I didn't have a", "29:01", "lot of experience so I was stuffing the", "29:03", "thing in there and when I tried to", "29:04", "deploy the parachute it just it was", "29:06", "asymmetrical so sometimes it'll it'll", "29:10", "open and it'll start spinning and then", "29:11", "you're flying with your back to the it", "29:13", "gets that would be considered an", "29:14", "exciting moment I would say so what", "29:16", "happened with you what exactly went", "29:17", "wrong I just came out asymmetrically the", "29:20", "parachute wasn't opening and were you", "29:21", "spinning no I wasn't I actually was able", "29:23", "to recognize just by it should come out", "29:25", "it looks like a rectangle more than", "29:27", "anything but if you look like a", "29:29", "rectangle that's twisted there's no way", "29:31", "to fix that no way so just get rid of it", "29:33", "and that's what I did I looked up and I", "29:35", "said okay that's not gonna work", "29:37", "reach pull reach pull and your reserve", "29:40", "opens so fast like by the time I felt", "29:42", "like by the time I had pulled the", "29:44", "reserve handle because I had to handle", "29:46", "that point by the time I had moved my", "29:47", "arm to three-quarters of extension it", "29:49", "had fired off Wow yeah dude", "29:52", "but the difference and you're asking the", "29:54", "difference like why is risk skydiving", "29:56", "lower it's because you have time", "29:58", "thousands of feet whereas BASE jumping", "30:01", "you might have hundreds or if you're", "30:05", "really pushing the envelope you might", "30:07", "have sub ten feet because you're flying", "30:09", "close to the ground as fast you can go", "30:10", "did your friend Alex who died did he die", "30:12", "BASE jumping or died wingsuit BASE", "30:14", "jumping something that I was I mean he", "30:17", "was my main BASE jumping partner what is", "30:19", "the difference between wingsuit BASE", "30:20", "jumping and regular base jump regular", "30:22", "base jumping you just have a quick", "30:23", "deploy parachute right so you have one", "30:25", "parachute system when you base jump", "30:27", "instead of two because there is not time", "30:29", "for reserve to open so that is just", "30:31", "taken out of the system right so you", "30:33", "pack your primary or only parachute very", "30:36", "similar to a reserve it's designed to", "30:38", "open rapidly it's designed to take a lot", "30:40", "of load but so BASE jumping is just", "30:44", "jumping off of a static object base", "30:46", "stands for building antenna span or", "30:48", "earth so four types of object the", "30:51", "addition of the wingsuit is really the", "30:53", "only difference which allows you to like", "30:56", "for myself personally I'm not a huge fan", "30:58", "of jumping off buildings in cliffs", "31:00", "without a wingsuit because I don't like", "31:02", "being from me to that flag when a", "31:04", "parachute opens because if it doesn't", "31:06", "open exactly in the direction you want", "31:08", "it to you better be johnny-on-the-spot", "31:09", "or you're gonna have a fucking problem", "31:10", "so it's to me if you have enough", "31:14", "altitude you put a wing suit on and two", "31:16", "or three seconds the suit is mocking", "31:18", "forward so then you're hundreds if not", "31:20", "thousands of feet away from the object", "31:21", "then your parachute can open up however", "31:23", "you want it to have they made any", "31:26", "improvements in the technology of this", "31:28", "stuff since you first started jumping", "31:30", "huge improvements I mean the first wing", "31:32", "suits were literally just fabric that", "31:34", "had like the little thumb loops you'll", "31:36", "find on like cold-weather long-sleeve", "31:37", "shirts sometimes seriously like Patra it", "31:41", "on that's how they kept it on I didn't", "31:44", "job any of those goddamn things but I", "31:46", "mean I think Patrick de garden is how", "31:48", "you say his name he was

term benefit but what I can say is", "41:40", "this if I stop BASE jumping what I will", "41:43", "replace that avid activity with is more", "41:45", "jiu-jitsu because what you just", "41:47",

am beautiful like sometimes", "42:12", "that'll be playing if I'm rolling but", "42:15", "this song it's like it's almost like it", "42:18", "sounds strange I never talked about this", "42:20", "before but it's almost like like a", "42:22", "mantra like a play certain parts of the", "42:25", "song over and over again in my head so", "42:27", "that I can think about that instead of", "42:29", "the the actual the actual training and", "42:33", "the actual strangling but you also have", "42:36", "I don't want to use the term master", "42:39", "because I don't know if you can master", "42:40", "it but where you are you are at a like", "42:43", "when you roll with somebody I was", "42:44", "talking with somebody about this not too", "42:45", "long ago when I roll with the black belt", "42:49", "the outcome is preordained right unless", "42:52", "they bought their black belt at Macy's", "42:54", "and they're pretending in which case I", "42:55", "don't know I still don't know enough it", "42:57", "might be preordained but the difference", "42:59", "in what I am thinking about versus what", "43:01", "would happen if you and I roll in what", "43:03", "you are thinking about or is gonna be", "43:05", "massive so I don't have the harddrive", "43:08", "space to sing Christina Aguilera yeah", "43:11", "and you probably don't even remember", "43:12", "half of the things that you do when you", "43:15", "roll or how you think about it because", "43:17", "you have experienced it so many times", "43:19", "the weirdest thing about jujitsu and", "43:21", "training and you know you could say this", "43:23", "about striking as well is sometimes", "43:25", "things happen and you didn't even think", "43:27", "about doing them you just did it those", "43:29", "are the weirdest moments like there's", "43:31", "sometimes we you'll you'll kick somebody", "43:33", "you like someone will move and you'll", "43:35", "you'll move and then before you know it", "43:38", "you're like wow I didn't even think", "43:39", "about throwing that and it lands it's", "43:42", "like your your your brain recognizes oh", "43:44", "I know what happens here you know you", "43:45", "step to the left and throw that left", "43:47", "kick and it just lands you just nowhere", "43:49", "to go and then the same thing happens", "43:51", "with jiu-jitsu like sometimes there's a", "43:53", "scramble and in the scramble all of a", "43:55", "sudden you're choking somebody it's like", "43:57", "this this movement happens and your body", "43:59", "just falls into place I'll let you know", "44:02", "if I ever experience that particularly", "44:03", "well it doesn't happen all the time it's", "44:06", "just there's moments where you're like", "44:08", "particularly if you do a lot of drilling", "44:10", "which I don't know how much drilling", "44:11", "you're doing but this one of the things", "44:12", "that I it made me way better when I", "44:15", "first started training with Eddie Bravo", "44:16", "one of the things that we did a lot from", "44:18", "white belt to blue belt our", "44:20", "was a lot of drills a lot of drills just", "44:23", "constant drilling and drilling is", "44:26", "overlooked and underappreciated because", "44:29", "sparring is so fun so like if you and", "44:32", "Jamie we're both learning together you", "44:33", "would do a few drills okay here's how", "44:35", "you do the armbar you're gonna secure", "44:37", "the arm you know swivel the hips throw", "44:39", "your leg over and tap good okay now your", "44:41", "turn you do it over and over again", "44:42", "that's fun that's fun okay now it's far", "44:44", "like all right but take it easy guys", "44:45", "work on the technique yeah it's a guys", "44:48", "we're gonna technique but if you could", "44:51", "spend more time drilling and less time", "44:53", "rolling you'll be way better at rolling", "44:55", "the whole idea is to discard these paths", "44:58", "in your mind you know and then you when", "45:01", "you see someone who like hits a perfect", "45:03", "'man re-roll like that is not the first", "45:05", "time they've done that you know there's", "45:09", "there's there's so many like super super", "45:12", "high level guys now that you could watch", "45:14", "on YouTube and you can watch them", "45:16", "execute these techniques yeah and the", "45:18", "thing that you're seeing more than", "45:19", "anything is like how fluid everything is", "45:22", "and how easily everything flows because", "45:25", "there's so much efficiency in their", "45:26", "movement because they've done it over", "45:28", "and over and over and but drilling is", "45:30", "everything and it's the thing that", "45:32", "people do the least of so I go when I'm", "45:34", "home I'd go five days a week and I I go", "45:37", "to the so you met Travis today Ami's", "45:40", "owner of the owner of SPG Kalispell", "45:42", "which is where I train I mean I couldn't", "45:45", "have planned it better it's like four", "45:46", "miles from my house that's amazing the", "45:48", "middle of Mullen up the middle the", "45:49", "northwest corner of Montana to have that", "45:52", "there is unbelievable how far you from", "45:54", "Bozeman", "45:54", "as the crow flies maybe 200 some miles", "45:58", "but the drive there is lightnin l it's", "46:01", "not straight mountains Risley bears yeah", "46:04", "swear Pass seen any grizzly since you've", "46:06", "been moved there no no they're fucking", "46:09", "everywhere they're waiting for you Ron I", "46:10", "don't leave my house I just I don't like", "46:11", "to you know I just hang out with myself", "46:13", "I have conversations but I'll do I do an", "46:17", "hour and a lot of it is just drill bass", "46:19", "for that hour and then there's an open", "46:21", "mat afterwards okay so I'm getting I", "46:23", "mean I feel like I'm getting a good mix", "46:25", "of both and for me I met the face like", "46:27", "I'm such in the alphabet face so I'm", "46:28", "like a b-boy like letters together into", "46:32", "words later", "46:33", "and when I roll I just tell myself you", "46:34", "know maybe just focus on the fundamental", "46:37", "so you don't need to create new", "46:38", "techniques right and overall that's true", "46:40", "and I try to relax and use zero strength", "46:42", "mmm because I am bigger than most people", "46:45", "that are there and I don't I've heard", "46:47", "enough times that if you rely on your", "46:49", "attributes early on what's gonna end up", "46:51", "happening is you'll have success early", "46:52", "and then you're gonna nosedive because", "46:54", "yes and so I'm just trying to go the", "46:55", "other route just be as calm as possible", "46:57", "use as little as strengths as possible", "46:59", "and just tap early and tap off it's my", "47:02", "favorite move yeah another good thing to", "47:04", "do is work off your back because you're", "47:05", "a big guy that's where I started I", "47:07", "actually asked it I said can you just", "47:09", "teach me the worst position ever and", "47:11", "I'll try to build up from there and I", "47:13", "don't care about offense I'd rather", "47:14", "learn defense that's that's very", "47:16", "intelligent of you that's something a", "47:17", "lot of people don't do and I certainly", "47:19", "didn't do I was just trying to choke", "47:20", "people quick like what could I what", "47:22", "could I do but if you can get really", "47:27", "comfortable with your defense it's the", "47:29", "most important thing like Hicks and", "47:31", "Gracie's always said that he's like the", "47:33", "most important things to be safe he's", "47:35", "like I'm always safe he goes no matter", "47:37", "where I'm or he would have", "47:38", "Hixton would have real like high level", "47:41", "black belts start on his back with a", "47:45", "fully locked in rear naked choke really", "47:47", "and then he would defend and then he", "47:49", "would always tap them I mean honestly to", "47:53", "me that's like holding a 45-pound plate", "47:56", "up letting go and I just hovers I'm at", "47:57", "just yeah beyond my understanding how", "47:59", "they're able to do that well there's", "48:01", "levels you know there's levels to", "48:02", "everything I miss i opening when I", "48:04", "started I'm like ill yet like this is", "48:08", "obviously a simple recipe go to gym tap", "48:12", "people out there's nothing in-between I", "48:13", "got this and then after bike my first 20", "48:16", "minutes like oh shit it's humbly again", "48:18", "but so that's one of the best parts", "48:20", "about it like I know so my body tells me", "48:23", "like I know who I'm gonna have a really", "48:25", "really tough role with and they're", "48:26", "probably gonna beat me and I can feel it", "48:28", "bouncing against my ego but I if I just", "48:30", "go roll with that go over there I bet", "48:31", "you'll be successful and I feel that", "48:33", "inherently mm-hmm and I'll just go roll", "48:35", "with the person I know who is probably", "48:36", "gonna beat me because that I love that", "48:39", "choice one something that protects your", "48:40", "ego and something that keeps it in check", "48:42", "yeah because it is it is humbling and", "48:45", "I've been a dumbass I should", "48:46", "tapped earlier before and I'm sitting", "48:47", "there they completely have me locked in", "48:49", "but I'm gonna try to muscle my way out", "48:51", "of this and then my arm sore for three", "48:53", "weeks well it's actually important to do", "48:54", "both believe it or not it's important to", "48:57", "be humbled for sure it's important to", "48:59", "have a realistic

it's more of", "55:58", "like a familiarity with training yeah", "56:01", "but you know as you get older you know", "56:03", "I'm 51 now the thing that happens is", "56:05", "your fucking joints and

and", "86:42", "just then rewarm yourself so they get", "86:44", "you to a point of hypothermia right to", "86:46", "the edge it's I think as many things are", "86:50", "in my old job there is a aspect of", "86:52", "learning and there is an aspect of tough", "86:55", "it out and you combine the two so it it", "86:58", "sucked and there was there was a reason", "86:59", "that they wanted it to suck but they're", "87:01", "also trying to teach a lesson right but", "87:03", "God forbid they just teach the lesson so", "87:04", "they make you suffer to ingrain it", "87:06", "probably yeah so

just", "87:46", "gonna get seven and a half minutes is", "87:47", "what you're gonna get so you go and you", "87:50", "sit there and it's the coal it hurts for", "87:51", "a minute and then you're numb the worst", "87:53", "thing about it actually is rewarming it", "87:54", "feels like you're just getting pinprick", "87:56", "Tovar and over it over again yes oh that", "87:59", "is barklow look at him standing up there", "88:01", "on that rock well barklow has a great", "88:03", "rewarming drill that we actually played", "88:05", "on the podcast before for Sitka where he", "88:08", "takes their gear and jumps into a lake", "88:11", "so that is the telling ya and then", "88:13", "rewarm himself with basically all", "88:16", "Sitka's gear and figures out how to get", "88:19", "your body back to what I thought was", "88:21", "interesting that I never really", "88:22", "considered there's that eating food", "88:23", "actually ramps up your body heat because", "88:26", "you have to burn off the calories yep", "88:27", "your body starts processing the food", "88:29", "actually", "88:30", "good for elevating body temperature", "88:31", "eating food especially if you can get", "88:33", "hot food of course yep but just eating", "88:35", "so the drill the drill he was doing", "88:37", "actually had much more I would say", "88:40", "educational benefit because they would", "88:41", "make them they would take them there", "88:43", "with all of their gear their gear list", "88:44", "would say whatever they were wearing", "88:46", "plus bring your tent your sleeping bag", "88:48", "and all your stuff because we're gonna", "88:49", "put you into the water and then you need", "88:51", "to survive your way out of it so they", "88:53", "would they would have to erect a tent", "88:55", "they would have to get their sleeping", "88:56", "bag out all after being in the water for", "88:58", "five minutes which is exactly what a", "88:59", "survival situation is gonna look like", "89:01", "for us we went in there got back into", "89:03", "the van and I sat in a hot tub and drank", "89:05", "beer for the rest of the day so I got", "89:07", "the understanding of what it feels like", "89:09", "to be hypothermic and that just see they", "89:11", "have to push their head under water whoo", "89:12", "right there is either screwing everybody", "89:14", "or was the first person to complete it", "89:16", "now wim HOF does so much of this cold", "89:21", "water submersion stuff and he actually", "89:23", "enjoys it and loves it yeah you know do", "89:25", "you think that there's a way that you", "89:26", "could use like his methods and get", "89:28", "through that with less pain potentially", "89:31", "even though you know all of the skills", "89:33", "that I used in Kodiak I I did not ever", "89:38", "use a single one of them operationally I", "89:40", "used his breathing method in the", "89:42", "cryotank that makes Sarah pee that makes", "89:45", "sense but that are those arctic", "89:46", "conditions I don't know at least in the", "89:48", "modern theatres of war were engaged I", "89:51", "don't know where the applicability would", "89:52", "be mmm so it might be a little bit of a", "89:54", "benefit versus time expended to teach", "89:57", "the guys that stuff hmm you know because", "89:59", "unless it's we're talking like Korea", "90:01", "probably farther in the northern you", "90:04", "know latitudes I mean it's uh like the", "90:07", "training was amazing like I said I", "90:09", "didn't use a single bit of it hmm right", "90:11", "but it's something well it's also", "90:12", "building mental toughness and", "90:14", "determination and that's why I said", "90:16", "there's an aspect of learning and", "90:17", "there's an aspect of just this is gonna", "90:19", "suck right hey you guys guess what", "90:21", "you're gonna do a 20 kilometer hike into", "90:23", "the backcountry and snowshoes there is", "90:25", "no end state to this there's no target", "90:27", "you're going to do anything on you're", "90:30", "just gonna go out there and you're gonna", "90:31", "do it you're gonna survive out there and", "90:32", "it's gonna suck for three days and then", "90:34", "you're gonna come back you just embrace", "90:35", "this up or you learn how to pack your", "90:38", "backpack better you know or you learn", "90:40", "how to move better over that terrain or", "90:41", "you learn how to navigate", "90:42", "that environment so there's always an", "90:43", "essence of it but it just happens to be", "90:45", "that there's usually a pain component", "90:46", "with it as well you know a lot of", "90:48", "military training is like that there's", "90:50", "an essence of pain compliance and then", "90:52", "the actual learning technique as well", "90:54", "yeah it's the learning technique I mean", "90:58", "it is really you're you're learning a", "91:00", "technique to manage your mind under", "91:03", "sucky conditions I'm graduated that is a", "91:05", "technique as well right so I was", "91:07", "actually having a conversation with", "91:08", "somebody about this recently I'm of the", "91:11", "opinion that really the only thing that", "91:14", "I learned how to do when I was a seal", "91:16", "was to enhance my ability to learn other", "91:20", "things mmm it's your selecting for", "91:22", "people and and to get to that point you", "91:25", "got to maintain control your emotions", "91:26", "whether you're in pain or you're hot or", "91:28", "you're cold so there's that that essence", "91:29", "of self-control but then they require so", "91:32", "many different skill sets and so many", "91:34", "different things that the selection", "91:36", "process is looking for and then at the", "91:38", "end of it teaching people how to become", "91:40", "better learners and then you just refine", "91:42", "that over and over and over again over a", "91:44", "career mmm it's the ability to learn is", "91:47", "probably the biggest takeaway that I", "91:50", "have from my time and service I think", "91:52", "that's the best thing you could ever", "91:53", "really learn is learning how to learn", "91:56", "yeah learning how to learn correctly", "91:57", "learning how to actually pay attention", "91:59", "to what someone's teaching you and", "92:00", "absorb it and follow the steps rather", "92:02", "than fuck it up with your own ego and", "92:04", "your own insecurities or whatever it is", "92:07", "it's going to trip you up if you can get", "92:09", "good at something you know you can you", "92:11", "can apply that to almost anything if you", "92:14", "really focus yeah and and then they", "92:16", "would pair it with will surround you by", "92:18", "okay we want to make you better at", "92:20", "shooting so we are gonna go find world", "92:21", "champion pistol carving shooters mm-hmm", "92:23", "go apply your ability to learn with them", "92:26", "and then do it for weeks okay now you're", "92:29", "gonna specialize you're gonna be a point", "92:31", "man so you need to be able to navigate", "92:32", "and climb so we're gonna send you out to", "92:33", "Joshua Tree for two weeks with", "92:35", "world-class climbers go apply your", "92:36", "ability to learn with them and then", "92:38", "jumping and then diving and then tactics", "92:41", "and then fill in the blank over a career", "92:43", "hmm that's another thing that freaks me", "92:46", "out is climbing did you do much climbing", "92:48", "I was a lead climber up until the point", "92:50", "where I don't have use of my ankle", "92:52", "anymore because of the nerve", "92:53", "oh and it's funny is I'm actually I", "92:55", "don't like Heights how did you free solo", "92:58", "at all uh as long as I wasn't more like", "93:02", "than three feet off the ground yes I'm", "93:04", "totally comfortable free soloing and", "93:05", "moving laterally but not vertically away", "93:07", "from the ground because I see oh my god", "93:09", "Honnold I want maybe three times in a", "93:11", "row and here's the thing I know he's", "93:13", "alive I know he was on your podcast I", "93:15", "listened to it and in the final scenes I", "93:18", "realized I was sitting there", "93:19", "white-knuckling my recliner like my", "93:22", "hands were sweating I'm like I know he", "93:24", "lives but it still freaked me the fuck", "93:27", "out Wow", "93:29", "I mean that guy yeah he's something but", "93:31", "you know what's interesting about", "93:32", "climbing is you get the more exposure", "93:34", "you have the less it bothers you like I", "93:36", "solely climbing is interesting", "93:38", "especially if you are placing your", "93:41", "protection as you go if it's drilled and", "93:43", "Bowl saying League or lead Eliade", "93:45", "typically like uh someone's in front of", "93:47", "you your rope as a lead climber you are", "93:50", "probably setting the ropes at least a", "93:52", "mile job you're setting the ropes for", "93:53", "the people who are gonna follow okay", "93:54", "most the time when you see people what", "93:57", "not most the time but one of the", "93:58", "disciplines would be there's bolted", "94:01", "routes that go up a rock so you can just", "94:03", "bring you know carabiners and put the", "94:05", "carabiner through that and you loop the", "94:06", "Rope through it and you're good to go", "94:08", "another aspect would be is you don't use", "94:10", "the bolted end stuff and you basically", "94:11", "carry on your climbing harness a rack of", "94:14", "gear so as you're holding on to the", "94:16", "rocks you're trying to wedge a block or", "94:18", "a stopper in or a cam system that it", "94:21", "rotates to be smaller than as you", "94:23", "release it opens up and if you pull", "94:25", "against it it locks itself into the rock", "94:26", "right so you're setting your own", "94:28", "protection and you trust those things so", "94:32", "that was the point that I was getting to", "94:33", "sometimes you get to a place you know", "94:35", "like this is the perfect piece of gear", "94:36", "and of course you're all like six feet", "94:38", "off the ground when the perfect piece of", "94:40", "gear and then you'll get multi pitches", "94:42", "up in the air should be two three", "94:43", "hundred feet up in the air and you're a", "94:45", "lead climber so there's nobody above you", "94:47", "and you're setting your own pro and", "94:49", "you're starting to get emotionally", "94:50", "involved in the situation that you're in", "94:52", "and you set a piece of pro and it's it's", "94:55", "rattling around a little bit so I don't", "94:57", "know we're we don't know how good that", "94:59", "one's gonna be but we're gonna keep", "95:00", "climbing and then the next piece of pro", "95:01", "you said not the most awesome piece", "95:03", "because you're worried about the one", "95:05", "beneath you", "95:07", "you don't want to fall so you get it in", "95:08", "there and then you just keep climbing so", "95:09", "sometimes it's awesome and sometimes", "95:11", "it's terrifying and then you got to", "95:13", "think that if you do fall all that force", "95:15", "if one pops and then the second one pops", "95:18", "you've got a lot of distance well you", "95:20", "get I think it's double the distance if", "95:22", "you're ten feet above the last piece of", "95:24", "protection you put in you follow the ten", "95:26", "feet to the protection then the ten feet", "95:28", "past the protection clink-clink-clink", "95:30", "and then it pulls on the pond the pro so", "95:32", "it's actually double the height that you", "95:34", "are above it it's not I've been probably", "95:39", "more scared out of my mind actually the", "95:42", "scaredy's scares I've ever been is a you", "95:45", "were lived in Boulder right yeah there's", "95:47", "a climb there called the bastille crack", "95:49", "it's in one of the national parks and I", "95:51", "was there with a buddy it was just me", "95:54", "and him in a world-class climber and I", "95:58", "was at the East Coast command at the", "96:00", "time so budget was no option I had the", "96:02", "newest shiniest stuff I'm like taking", "96:04", "plastic off of climbing gear to go climb", "96:06", "this rock this guy pulls up in a van", "96:09", "with a Marlboro hanging out and you know", "96:11", "tennis shoes that have laces probably on", "96:14", "one of them one of the one of the shoes", "96:16", "in a and an old pair of pants and he's", "96:18", "climbed like every mountain ever so it's", "96:20", "me and my buddy we're climbing our way", "96:21", "up I'm leading this pitch so you switch", "96:24", "one guy will climb he sets an anchor the", "96:26", "other person comes up and they pick all", "96:28", "the protection out so you can just", "96:29", "switch and then the other person leads", "96:31", "the way on the next one so I'm like", "96:33", "halfway up this pitch and I can't move", "96:37", "because I'm losing my shit I'm like 15", "96:41", "feet above the last piece of protection", "96:43", "that I just put in I'm convinced that I", "96:45", "feel my feet slipping off of the rock", "96:47", "I'm holding I had my hand jammed into", "96:49", "the rock and then you make a fist to", "96:51", "like you know prevent it from falling", "96:52", "out you can actually see alex is doing", "96:54", "that in free solo as he's climbing up", "96:56", "they'll slide their hand in and then", "96:57",

like to", "121:21", "see this country have a conversation", "121:22", "instead of entrenched positions either", "121:25", "the left or the right all guns should be", "121:28", "bans come get them with your cold my", "121:30", "cold dead hands", "121:31", "right which I don't again I find myself", "121:34", "in the middle of that I don't agree with", "121:36", "either of those positions because

any real there's no", "122:09", "real plans to stop this stuff and I", "122:12", "don't think anybody has a real answer", "122:14", "and that's one of the reasons why it's", "122:16", "so confusing to people because you could", "122:18", "do well on it and roll it over in your", "122:20", "head", "122:21", "all day long and there's nothing that", "122:23", "stands out as obvious like hey there's a", "122:25", "fire", "122:26", "go pour water on it that's obvious", "122:28", "there's no there's no solution and", "122:29", "they're low-hanging fruit the metaphor", "122:31", "for the school shootings would be", "122:32", "there's a gun or water on that right", "122:35", "right but the more nuanced and complex", "122:37", "problem is actually the human being", "122:38", "behind it and I see people they just", "122:40", "well that's too difficult so I'm gonna", "122:41", "throw my hands up and give up you know I", "122:43", "mean but also to I think it's important", "122:45", "to point out that actually it's", "122:47", "thankfully it's incredibly rare that it", "122:51", "actually happens and it's funny because", "122:53", "you look at the stats and you start", "122:55",

"123:02", "different sets of numbers there's school", "123:05", "shootings and then there's shootings", "123:07", "that happen at schools and you can make", "123:09", "one number look bigger and one number", "123:11", "looks smaller like if you wanted to", "123:13", "include the number of people who commit", "123:14", "suicide in a school parking lot which at", "123:16", "a national level is

"123:48", "violence and the actual numbers and he", "123:49", "was saying well this is these are the", "123:51", "real statistics and this is why the", "123:53", "numbers are so high how many of these", "123:55", "when you're including gun violence how", "123:57", "these people are like criminals are", "123:59", "being shot in the act by police officers", "124:01", "how many of them are

know I mean there's there's", "124:20", "there's a lot of different factors then", "124:21", "you get to these mass shootings yep so", "124:24", "the the mass shootings it's it it's a", "124:27", "relatively small percentage but that", "124:28", "doesn't give anybody any comfort for", "124:30", "anybody that suffer of course it doesn't", "124:32", "and again it's it doesn't excuse it", "124:34", "it's just thankfully it happens", "124:38", "infrequently I wish the number was zero", "124:40", "we're now at and I think the answer to", "124:43", "getting it to 0 will be generational",

myself", "156:44", "we ended to Afghanistan we were", "156:45", "incredibly effective so we cut the head", "156:48", "off of that snake but it spawned two", "156:49", "more you go into Iraq you can
