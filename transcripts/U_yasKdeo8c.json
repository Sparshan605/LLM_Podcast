oh and 85 watt flying cars because", "142:01", "that was the trajectory and it just went", "142:03", "well they do have flying cars they just", "142:05", "don't use them and they're not very good",

they", "143:48", "find what the star is and they", "143:49", "recognized", "143:50", "there's like a certain kind of a wobble", "143:52", "- and they just coming so they time to", "143:54", "kill yeah

yeah and they realize like oh", "144:53", "wait a minute they they they are way", "144:55", "bigger than we thought like when that", "144:56", "happens an asteroid slammed into Jupiter", "144:59", "and the explosion was larger than the", "145:01", "size of the earth yeah they have", "145:04", "pictures of that I think that's true", "145:06", "yeah they did I might have made that up", "145:08", "no you're right I think I get that man", "145:11", "like that's the impact we need that big", "145:14", "planet that's how it changed the color", "145:16", "of the stripe", "145:17", "I heard that where so we wouldn't be", "145:21", "here without Jupiter because it scoops", "145:22", "up a lot of the asteroids yeah", "145:23", "apparently it's so massive yeah but it", "145:26", "sucks things into it said each sl9", "145:28", "nucleus hurled material into space which", "145:31", "left a large scar when it fell onto", "145:34", "Jupiter god it's so amazing to think", "145:37", "that there's these enormous Matt you", "145:39", "know Mike Miami sized rocks fly through", "145:43", "space and they could just slam into us", "145:46", "and then everything's off everything's", "145:49", "off the electricity the power the lights", "145:51", "the Sun you can't breathe you know if", "145:54", "you're anywhere near the impact you're", "145:56", "dead instantly anywhere near with", "145:58",

you're talking about", "146:08", "earlier mm-hmm", "146:09", "what's when's that supposed to blow up", "146:11", "because that'll that'll kill everybody", "146:13", "right it's a caldera supervolcano it's a", "146:16", "volcano that they didn't realize was a", "146:18", "volcano until like they started using", "146:20", "satellites I believe they just thought", "146:22", "that it was like seismically active hot", "146:24", "springs yeah beautiful so pretty", "146:27", "donk you've eaten and then one day is", "146:29", "that the actual impact oh my god you can", "146:31", "see the impact look at that watch my", "146:35", "hits and it break back it up back it out", "146:37", "watch this look at this here's how it", "146:40", "hits the gravity breaks it up I think", "146:41", "before it hits so there's like a bunch", "146:43", "of old pock marks boom boom boom boom", "146:46", "look at that so that explosion", "146:48", "apparently was the size of the earth", "146:52", "find out that's true I could maybe use", "146:54", "aliens bro find out that's true it was", "146:56", "that explosion", "146:57", "besides the earth I think we shouldn't", "147:00", "check any but we were saying just in", "147:02", "case let's just not check all right but", "147:05", "I think it's it's somewhere in that", "147:06", "range but if that hit us man that's a", "147:09", "wrap I think the red dots about our size", "147:11", "the Red Storm and the thing is man", "147:14", "there's fucking holes all over this", "147:15", "planet we're here oh yeah things hit", "147:18", "here all the time just like no rhyme or", "147:20", "reason to it either it's not like they", "147:22", "wouldn't hit us man we're like really", "147:23", "close to 5g nationwide don't give a fuck",

then", "147:38", "you realize how stupid it was to care", "147:40", "that's gonna happen yeah what we all", "147:42", "trying to feel different racism sexism", "147:44", "any kind of discrimination homophobia", "147:47", "all of its gonna seem so stupid we see a", "147:48", "rock flying out of sky look my god have", "147:51", "been so distracted yeah I don't know if", "147:54", "they can even knock those things out", "147:56", "that was a little exaggeration that says", "147:59", "one group of astronomers estimate the", "148:01", "object to be 16 and a half to 65 feet", "148:03", "across same size the explosion didn't", "148:09", "they say the explosion was some I", "148:10", "thought of massive now what is it what", "148:13", "about this thing about the size of the", "148:14", "explosion though because that was the", "148:15", "thing that they were stunned", "148:16", "they were stunned by the actual size of", "148:18", "the impact area even though it is a gas", "148:21", "giant so I don't know how the fuck it", "148:22", "even yeah what is what is happening yeah", "148:24", "what's it what's happening when it has a", "148:26", "hard core or the bottom probably right I", "148:30", "don't even know how stupid am I", "148:31", "it's a gas giant it's just again strong", "148:34", "you know I would say that real console", "148:36", "yeah someone was gonna question me I'd", "148:39", "like well you know Jupiter is a gas", "148:40", "giant yeah oh yeah very confident when", "148:43", "my work can't be checked venus hottest", "148:47", "planet in the solar system and it's not", "148:49", "the closest it's because the greenhouse", "148:50", "gases pumping into our atmosphere wow", "148:53", "are you not metal on the surface of", "148:56", "Venus yeah things are I do notice more", "149:00", "fires mm-hmm well the climate certainly", "149:03", "shifting and but here's this is my point", "149:06", "not that there's anything wrong with", "149:08", "recognizing that we're doing irreparable", "149:10", "harm to the atmosphere we definitely are", "149:12", "but we also should be aware that even if", "149:16", "we weren't this motherfucker is not", "149:17",
