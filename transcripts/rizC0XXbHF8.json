together to come together that", "02:35", "week eight hilarya you imagine what they", "02:39", "are finding is that there's like two", "02:41", "parts of our operating brain and this is", "02:44", "you know going to be me paring it down", "02:47", "but one is the analytical thinking", "02:49", "deciding thing and the other is this", "02:51", "social awareness brain which is always", "02:54", "like always checking in on how am I in", "02:58", "relation to others I mean it's also the", "02:59", "car that brain that actually we could", "03:01", "like the metacognitive part in the part", "03:03", "that I can they call it mind-reading but", "03:05", "really it's just it's just by us sitting", "03:07", "here I can kind of get a sense of how", "03:10", "you feel and what you're thinking right", "03:11", "just by the the connection that we have", "03:13", "and just it's it's part of we are so", "03:15", "when our analytical brain is offline", "03:18", "this other one that the social web pops", "03:19", "on immediately so so what they're", "03:22", "theorizing is that that is like the", "03:25", "fundamental need for humans in safety", "03:28", "and survival is how are we relating to", "03:32", "each other as a group but it makes sense", "03:34", "if you look I mean to me it makes sense", "03:36", "in you know we are social animals we", "03:39", "forget that I think but you look at", "03:41", "other species of monkeys or wolves or", "03:43", "whatever I mean you know there might be", "03:47", "a period of time where say a wolf will", "03:50", "will get kicked out of a pack for a", "03:51", "while and he'll go do this thing but it", "03:53", "eventually come back to the pack", "03:54", "it's not safe for us as humans and", "03:57", "animals social animals like these to be", "04:00", "isolated it's not and so there's all", "04:03", "these parts of us that just if we're not", "04:06", "connected to other people in a very", "04:08", "direct and true way there's these sort", "04:10", "of deep down emotional and physiological", "04:15", "fears that come up right and then", "04:18", "they're real and that's what the", "04:19", "neurobiology is showing which is really", "04:21", "interesting and we can just think about", "04:23", "that but they're actually showing it now", "04:24", "that if we're not really connected to", "04:27", "each", "04:27", "we're going to be freaked out we're not", "04:29", "going to be okay and you know I really", "04:32", "believe that this really drives a lot of", "04:34", "the internal struggle we have and we're", "04:37", "really and this is part of you know", "04:39", "getting into it that's part of my what", "04:41", "I'm trying to bring into the world and", "04:42", "my platform now is is just to you know", "04:45", "stand up and say hey we need each other", "04:48", "and we can do it it's not and for guys", "04:51", "specifically right it's such an social", "04:53", "stigma of all right not be real or open", "04:56", "or connected or vulnerable with guys and", "04:58", "and it's it's cool to see the science", "05:02", "coming out because it's I have all this", "05:04", "anecdotal evidence of being out the wood", "05:06", "in the woods with kids or being in a", "05:09", "manager with guys or running a retreat", "05:10", "or whatever this is of how powerful it", "05:12", "is to like set down all of our", "05:15", "differences and just be there with yeah", "05:17", "but now the science is really lighten it", "05:20", "up and yeah man loneliness I mean we", "05:22", "cannot think about loneliness isn't fun", "05:24", "it's not doesn't feel good but the other", "05:27", "this is crazy too that they're showing", "05:29", "that emotional pain lights up the same", "05:32", "centers of our brain it's physical pain", "05:35", "and that one study showed that an insult", "05:40", "to someone had much more painful and", "05:43", "long-term effects than slamming somebody", "05:45", "with a hammer hitting their hand with a", "05:47", "hammer so like our emotional pain", "05:49", "literally actually exists in the body", "05:53", "like it is actual pain and the reason", "05:56", "that it's so uncomfortable to feel our", "05:59", "emotions which it is you know I mean", "06:01", "I'll just say it is that it actually", "06:04", "hurts like actually hurts I mean and", "06:06", "there's like people say things like you", "06:08", "broke my heart or I'm dying of heart", "06:10", "ache or whatever but that the science is", "06:12", "catching up and showing us that this", "06:13", "pain is actual it's real I know you're", "06:16", "really interested in this and I am too", "06:19", "and the there are some misconceptions", "06:22", "and that why shouldn't a their", "06:24", "misconceptions I would say that there's", "06:26", "a distortion of what's going on and this", "06:28", "is not to say it's it's actually to say", "06:31", "that it's worse than you think it is", "06:32", "well so what most people who are outside", "06:35", "of academia think is going on is not", "06:37", "quite what's going on what do you think", "06:39", "we think it's", "06:40", "something worse why no because I've hear", "06:41", "her doing lots and lots of people talk", "06:42", "about and it's not your fault at all", "06:44", "because you're not there and all you do", "06:45", "is get the media reports about it so I", "06:47", "think what most people I get it from GAD", "06:48", "sad Jordan Peterson yeah professors they", "06:51", "and day if you listen to them actually", "06:53", "they will day themselves we'll talk", "06:55", "about it a little differently but people", "06:56", "still consume it differently because the", "06:57", "news right is all about the crazy thing", "07:01", "that the eighteen-year-old said right at", "07:03", "Wesleyan or whatever or they're not the", "07:05", "18 year old it's the forty-five year old", "07:06", "and then sometime up the 45 year old", "07:08", "yeah okay but here's that stuff that", "07:11", "really sort of Looney stuff you know", "07:13", "that you hear coming out or protest you", "07:17", "know people saying that they are going", "07:20", "to die because you said a word that", "07:23", "happens it does it's all true", "07:25", "it's all there I've seen it but I've", "07:27", "seen it maybe at most one time a year", "07:30", "making the colleges where I've been", "07:32", "maybe not even less than that okay what", "07:35", "is and if it were just that that's not", "07:38", "actually a big deal it's much worse than", "07:40", "that", "07:41", "what's what's worse is that if that", "07:44", "there is a self-censorship", "07:46", "going on that's universal and profound", "07:50", "constant omnipresent like for instance", "07:54", "you know I never talk about my love for", "07:57", "boxing around academics or I'm very", "07:59", "careful if I do but it's not even that", "08:01", "it's that we know that there are certain", "08:03", "things that can't be said on a college", "08:04", "campus and so we just don't say them", "08:07", "therefore there's no need to police us", "08:09", "there's no need to yell at us and scream", "08:12", "at us in protest what's the motivation", "08:14", "for the for which should the people that", "08:16", "are holding back on thoughts that maybe", "08:18", "they would normally express okay don't", "08:20", "well here's what I think it is for the", "08:21", "senior faculty who have tenure", "08:23", "meaning lifetime appointments cowardice", "08:26", "death all it is right they're cowards", "08:29", "yeah if you are an adjunct like me with", "08:32", "no job security or if you're an", "08:34", "assistant professor up for tenure and if", "08:36", "you don't get tenure you have no career", "08:38", "I don't blame them I get it that's what", "08:40", "I've done to police myself because you", "08:42", "have to to stay in the game if you have", "08:44", "tenure lifetime appointment your senior", "08:46", "professor you make the decisions they're", "08:48", "on curriculum hiring and firing and", "08:50", "tenure the faculty make those decisions", "08:53", "and you don't challenge these crazy", "08:55", "ideas in any way or if you police", "08:58", "yourself you stop yourself from saying", "08:59", "things that you you think are right that", "09:01", "you believe in you're a coward", "09:04", "I'm sorry those people are cowards I do", "09:06", "they mean is it's just overrun by", "09:07", "cowards yeah yeah yeah no I mean this", "09:10", "they are very dope so here's the thing I", "09:13", "can't prove this this is just I'm just", "09:15", "saying this is this is my belief but I", "09:17", "think it's pretty well informed because", "09:18", "I've been around these people a long", "09:20", "time and in part I share this the I", "09:22", "think the worst fear of all those people", "09:26", "is being called a racist or a sexist", "09:29", "publicly and I think that is their", "09:32", "version of being in a cave crawling on", "09:35", "their bellies in the ditch black I think", "09:37", "that's their worst fear", "09:43", "[Applause]", "09:44", "[Music]", "09:45", "[Applause]", "English (auto-generated)"]
