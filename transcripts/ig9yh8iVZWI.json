are getting locked down what's", "07:54", "really bothering me is this idea that", "07:58", "once you get control of people that", "08:02", "they're not gonna let go that if they", "08:05", "start taking away civil liberties if", "08:07", "they started moving you through", "08:09", "checkpoints when you want to travel you", "08:11", "have to and you're on your car you have", "08:12", "to wait

"09:41", "the disease 200,000 had it what killed", "09:44", "them right there done right 10 million", "09:47", "had it yeah they're there in an urn you", "09:49", "got it", "09:50", "what this guy the 21 million cell phone", "09:52", "thing was but locals protest against", "09:54", "cremation of dark no that's on it no no", "09:56", "there's a crematorium here I'll send it", "09:59", "to you give

but", "14:33", "mostly hina people have tested twice", "14:35", "well that could have been a false", "14:36", "positive on either end or it could be", "14:39", "that you get it again it's true yeah I", "14:41", "don't think they know yet that's true if", "14:43", "this really is some sort of a man-made", "14:45", "concocted virus maybe that makes sense", "14:49", "maybe that makes sense that that's why", "14:51", "it's acting so weird it's different in", "14:53", "different people they don't understand", "14:55", "it you know I mean or maybe it's just a", "14:57", "really particular

"because someone was like really trying", "103:32", "to get me to have someone on I got a do", "103:35", "I have to talk to the people that I want", "103:37", "to talk to it has to be my idea because", "103:39", "I've got to really be engaged I've got a", "103:41", "and sometimes people brought me ideas", "103:43", "for guests and it was good ideas and I", "103:45", "was really engaged don't get me wrong", "103:47", "it's not that I'm not open to", "103:48", "suggestions that it seems to be I have", "103:51", "to genuinely want to do it then it seems", "103:54", "that while it's happening I have to", "103:58", "really be engaged in the conversation", "104:00", "like I have to it needs to be or if it's", "104:02", "not organic man people get it they know", "104:05", "when you're hosing them yeah you know", "104:08", "well people know that yeah and most", "104:10", "people in their life which is kind of", "104:11", "what we've created lives where we can", "104:13", "kind of be you know authentic like we", "104:16", "can cut like most people have to file", "104:17", "into certain whether it's an office or", "104:20", "wherever and they have to just tolerate", "104:21", "bullshit yes and they have to talk to", "104:23", "people they don't like and you've", "104:25", "created a life where if you're not", "104:26", "interested in what somebody has to say", "104:28", "you don't have to speak to them well", "104:29", "it's also it doesn't mean that you're", "104:32", "not going to get things wrong and this", "104:33", "is what people have to understand like", "104:35", "you everyone's going to get things wrong", "104:37", "if you talk as much as I do", "104:38", "but I think I'm real honest about when I", "104:41", "get it wrong so you have to be able to", "104:44", "say like I shouldn't have said it that", "104:45", "way I should have done that but it", "104:47", "doesn't mean that you're not going to", "104:49", "get it wrong it's just you're gonna get", "104:50", "better at being you right like you're", "104:53", "you're really good at being you these", "104:56", "rants that yeah yeah burrs really good", "104:59", "at being himself", "105:00", "yeah those rants amazing yes he's", "105:03", "probably the best at just no pauses yet", "105:07", "no just no holds bar just runs right", "105:10", "through subjects with no preparations", "105:13", "great yeah he's developed", "105:15", "oh and Stanhope's really good at it too", "105:17", "like the Stanhope yeah his podcast yeah", "105:20", "kind of developed yeah because he", "105:22", "doesn't have open mic nights right yeah", "105:24", "I use it because in LA you know it's", "105:27", "there's just is less stage time than you", "105:29", "would have some other places even though", "105:30", "there's enough you could do enough and I", "105:31", "was doing a lot in the road but like", "105:33", "it's more fun for me to just go off", "105:35", "you're getting their last stage time in", "105:38", "LA", "105:38", "you were in New York New York you can", "105:40", "get up a crazy amount really well", "105:43", "there's so many clubs you can run from", "105:45", "Club to club to club to club", "105:46", "I mean guys like mark Normand could do", "105:47", "like 13 spots and and that I mean that's", "105:49", "inhuman but that's why he's he's so good", "105:51", "it's like you can do so much I like the", "105:54", "amount of stage time I get here because", "105:55", "the podcast is a great way to build", "105:57", "longer form bits mm-hmm than just", "106:00", "running where I have to get a laugh in", "106:01", "front of an audience you could do both", "106:02", "right of course so you could do the", "106:04", "podcast in New York and then just do 20", "106:06", "spots at night yes do you think that", "106:08", "would be the way to go is that the best", "106:09", "we know uh no I think it depends what", "106:12", "you how what your act is right so if", "106:14", "your act is quick boom boom Jelks boom", "106:16", "boom boom yeah a repetition is probably", "106:18", "better but sometimes it's better to let", "106:21", "an idea of ruminate on a podcast and", "106:24", "then to do maybe longer sets less", "106:26", "frequently people might want to build", "106:28", "that way it's so individual man there's", "106:29", "no like one way you should do it yeah I", "106:32", "completely agree and I think yeah", "106:34", "there's like a there's almost like a", "106:35", "formula we're getting onstage is a", "106:39", "hundred right yeah in terms of like the", "106:42", "amount of value you get for your effort", "106:45", "standing on getting on stage is 100 and", "106:48", "writing is maybe 30 or 40 yeah but if", "106:51", "you do it enough it accumulates money in", "106:54", "the bank you know in terms of like", "106:56", "numbers in the bank got it to it to get", "106:58", "and I think that listening to a set is", "107:01", "worth like 40 or 50 so writings worth", "107:04", "like 30 or 40 and listening to sets like", "107:07", "worth like 40 or 50 and getting onstage", "107:08", "worth a hundred yeah Ralphie may did a", "107:10", "great talk at I think I forget where it", "107:12", "was maybe the Comedy Store maybe The", "107:14", "Improv I don't know but you did a talk", "107:16", "on stand-up where he
