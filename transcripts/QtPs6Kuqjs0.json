"09:27", "there's some doctors there's one doctor", "09:28", "particular that explored this see if you", "09:30", "can find that guy's name who stopped", "09:33", "doing most shoulder surgeries and", "09:36", "started putting people on hanging", "09:38", "therapy where it just tells them you", "09:40", "know at the beginning just have a bar", "09:41", "that's not quite above your head so they", "09:43", "you could just sort of relax your knees", "09:46", "and you know if you can't carry all of", "09:48", "your weight in your hands just carry a", "09:50", "good percentage of your weight in your", "09:51", "hands and try to relax your shoulders", "09:53", "and it releases impingements it", "09:55", "stretches that joint out the idea is", "09:57", "that we came from tree swinging primates", "10:00", "and then as tree swinging primates we're", "10:02", "constantly doing that and that's what", "10:04", "the shoulder joint is meant to do it's", "10:06", "meant to articulate in that way we grab", "10:08", "something", "10:08", "swing and and then not having this full", "10:11", "range of motion and not using it on a", "10:13", "regular basis and here's this guy's book", "10:17", "dr. John Kirsch John M Kirsch and he", "10:22", "came up with this many years ago when he", "10:26", "realized that one of the things that was", "10:28", "messing people up was just they just", "10:30", "their joints weren't being put through", "10:33", "the full range of motion and that by", "10:35", "hanging you could release a tremendous", "10:37", "amount of the pain and undiscovered that", "10:40", "a lot of people are facing that makes a", "10:41", "ton of sense so you it seems to me that", "10:43", "you guys are actually saying talking", "10:45", "about the same thing when you're talking", "10:46", "about the mind and you're talking about", "10:47", "the body I'm talking about impingement", "10:49", "and you're talking about where your mind", "10:51", "is limited I think it's the same exact", "10:53", "dynamic actually that's of what's going", "10:56", "on like how would you define what an", "10:57", "impingement is in the body a blockade", "11:01", "you know like I would say lack of range", "11:04", "of motion", "11:05", "poor exercise habits there's a variety", "11:10", "of factors ignoring potential injuries", "11:12", "and then restricting your motion to the", "11:15", "point where everything sort of tightens", "11:16", "up muscle tissue in particular joint", "11:19", "tissue like around the shoulders and any", "11:23", "anytime where you're dealing with range", "11:25", "of motion issues you have to stretch and", "11:27", "your most people very rarely stretch", "11:30", "their shoulders it's just something that", "11:31", "we don't do and also most people very", "11:34", "rarely strengthen their shoulders and I", "11:36", "think it's it's a very complex joint I", "11:39", "mean you look at the way your shoulders", "11:40", "articulate there's not like there's not", "11:42", "anything in your body that can do this", "11:45", "sort of things and the range of motion", "11:46", "that your shoulders exhibit while", "11:48", "carrying weight so you think about all", "11:50", "the different things carrying your kid", "11:51", "picking up a briefcase you're doing a", "11:53", "lot of weird motions with your shoulders", "11:55", "and

pops", "12:04", "you ignore it it hurts you for years", "12:06", "there's a lot of things that we do to", "12:08", "our bodies that we just it just compiles", "12:11", "and you never handle it you never deal", "12:13", "with it you don't get that our MRI you", "12:15", "don't get therapy and it just gets worse", "12:17", "and worse to the point where you see a", "12:19", "lot of people get shoulder replacements", "12:21", "yeah so the exact same thing is true", "12:23", "everything you just said is true for the", "12:24", "mind hmm it's exactly the same it's", "12:26", "conditioning it's repeating the same", "12:29", "pattern over and over having some kind", "12:31", "of involuntary response that gets a", "12:33", "little bit deeper a little bit deeper a", "12:34", "little bit deeper each time and it's", "12:36", "like your your mind is a mental body and", "12:39", "it has habits and it develops bad habits", "12:42", "and it develops limited range of motions", "12:45", "what it can do and so we end up in this", "12:47", "really narrow situation inevitably", "12:50", "because we end up with a particular set", "12:51", "of conditioning and it starts to limit",

"13:09", "there's just this sort of isometric", "13:11", "nature between the mind and body it's", "13:13", "the same kind of stuff it completely", "13:15", "makes sense yeah and I was what I were", "13:17", "talking about before", "13:18", "the podcast we're in the hallway about", "13:20", "just dealing with stressful situations", "13:23", "and the tank like if there's a weird", "13:25", "freak out that happens like how do you", "13:28", "handle it like what what do you do and I", "13:30", "was saying that the more stressful", "13:33", "situations that I experience the more I", "13:36", "understand what they are and the more I", "13:37", "can relax but it's also like the matter", "13:41", "of constantly being exposed to these", "13:44", "stressful situations where there's not a", "13:46", "long break in between doing stand-up or", "13:49", "a long break in between martial arts", "13:51", "training where to the point where", "13:53", "anxiety can build up and then once you", "13:56", "get into it it's almost an it's an", "13:57", "unusual situation instead of an unusual", "14:00", "one that's probably why I probably need", "14:01", "to get in the tank reasonably soon yeah", "14:04", "so but say more if you don't this is", "14:06", "your show but if you don't mind would", "14:07", "you say more about that like because you", "14:10", "you're able to get in the tank not only", "14:13", "regularly but you'll you'll dose", "14:15", "yourself with some stuff you get in the", "14:17", "tank well the thing about stressful", "14:22", "situations is you're always trying to", "14:24", "once you get comfortable you're trying", "14:26", "to push them and make them more", "14:28", "stressful and this most distressful way", "14:30", "to experience the tank is either edibles", "14:33", "or mushrooms those are the two", "14:35", "fermenting mushrooms yeah Wow yeah well", "14:38", "it's just it's basically mushrooms", "14:41", "without any of the distractions of your", "14:43", "body right distill a pure culture pure", "14:50", "culture mushrooms and but but edibles it", "14:53", "can be just as potent in there", "14:55", "edible marijuana is you know the", "14:57", "difference most people aren't aware that", "15:00", "it's a completely different psychoactive", "15:02", "substance when it's when you eat it", "15:04", "because it's processed by your liver

the end of it I looked down at", "24:28", "my watch the two hours had passed and", "24:30", "but then I was fully in this zone of", "24:32", "like oh this is the end of my next book", "24:34", "I this is I'm enlightened this is the", "24:36", "best thing ever and I then a couple of", "24:41", "hours later start to realize that I had", "24:42", "been telling myself a story about how", "24:44",

these", "25:24", "layers of relaxation you hit another", "25:26", "layer and you go okay no this is", "25:28", "relaxing and then you know there's way", "25:30", "more than this there's way more to this", "25:32", "and the more you think about the fact", "25:35", "that oh now I'm on a new level", "25:37", "relaxation well now you're not", "25:38", "now you're probably two or three levels", "25:40", "above where you were before you", "25:42", "addressed it", "25:42", "that's the exfoliation you were talking", "25:45", "about it's somewhat the layers of the", "25:46", "onion and just you have to peel those", "25:48", "layers I always talk about it's exactly", "25:52", "you're describing exactly it's the", "25:54", "layers of the onion you it's like you", "25:56", "you're holding this fist and you don't", "25:58", "even realize you're holding this fist", "25:59", "you're walking around going yeah", "26:00", "everything's fine but you're holding", "26:01", "this fist and then you

opens of itself and", "26:17", "then you think you're free and I think I", "26:19", "described it as like walk in the onion", "26:21", "you know it's like you're walking on top", "26:22", "of the onion and your knee it's imagine", "26:23", "the planet isn't onion you're walking", "26:25", "and you're turning the onion is you walk", "26:26", "and you've got the huge open air all", "26:28",

"26:35", "that starts to kind of coagulate in your", "26:38", "experience and eventually you realize", "26:39", "that there's this layer of tension here", "26:40", "and you're not free inside this thing", "26:42", "and then you have to figure out how to", "26:43", "exfoliate that or let that go and it", "26:46", "just keeps going on because it's Turtles", "26:49", "all the way down it's like an onion at", "26:51", "layer after onion layer and every time", "26:53", "you get into a new place of freedom the", "26:55", "fact and the act of living is creating", "26:58", "more coagulation it's creating more just", "27:00", "natural frictions and things that are", "27:02", "coming up so it's not just that you're", "27:03", "going through so the the progress of", "27:06", "insight the

say there is no end to it you", "27:24", "don't get to some final liberation", "27:26", "because just the act of living is", "27:28", "creating its own blind spots you know so", "27:31", "you've got different people in different", "27:32", "camps who argue different things about", "27:33", "what your real freedom looks like but", "27:35", "that to me seems the most realistic you", "27:38", "know and least it's the one it that fits", "27:40", "with my experience and it describes", "27:42", "exactly how you describe it you know the", "27:44", "- are they really line up I think most", "27:47",

have", "28:27", "these paths carved in their movements", "28:29", "and their thought process and when", "28:30", "they're in a situation they fall back on", "28:32", "those patterns and it's extremely", "28:34", "difficult to get people out of that and", "28:36", "learn to do things correctly but if you", "28:39", "can teach them how to do things", "28:40", "correctly from the beginning then they", "28:42", "naturally great like this is the", "28:44", "stressful situation here comes the", "28:46", "problem here's", "28:47", "the issue what's the technique now you", "28:49", "know it and it's it's locked into your", "28:51", "brain you know the right pathway whether", "28:53", "it's like don't go to the technique", "28:54", "you've been using all your life now use", "28:56", "a

echoes of when you were a teenager", "29:19", "or even younger than that and then maybe", "29:22", "your parents and the learned behavior", "29:24", "that you see watching them and maybe", "29:26",

"29:43", "very difficult to sort of rethink how", "29:47", "you think I mean I think what you're", "29:48", "pointing to here is close to the the", "29:53", "what has become for me the animating",

"30:06", "ruts in which many of us find ourselves", "30:08", "or don't even know we're in but the good", "30:12", "news is that there are ways to retrain", "30:15", "the mind week and I didn't know

growing body of", "30:54", "research about psychedelics as well I it", "30:56", "was obvious to me from being in the", "30:58", "isolation from the sensory deprivation", "31:00", "that that is a

sit down on a meditation", "59:13", "cushion and you think you're relaxed and", "59:15", "you realize you're actually kind of", "59:17", "uptight and you're like and then you let", "59:19", "go of

we all know that we", "60:08", "need conscious awareness we need to be", "60:12", "here and present but also that thinking", "60:16", "of conscious awareness the in the", "60:19", "control that we try

true but and that's", "60:44", "what's gonna free you up to be the most", "60:46", "effective in your caring you cannot get", "60:48", "around that head-fuck because it is", "60:49", "absolutely and that is absolutely true", "60:51", "you know so we would I mean this is the", "60:54", "thing that people really struggle with", "60:56", "because a lot of people here will hear", "60:58", "everything you just said and you know", "61:01", "and all this stuff about shins and you", "61:04", "know not caring and think okay if I", "61:06", "meditate well I'm gonna be ineffective", "61:07", "I'm not gonna be able to do anything but", "61:09", "that's what I'm saying is the paradox", "61:10", "it's like the person who's most", "61:11", "effective is the person who gives up", "61:13", "needing to be effective it's like you", "61:15", "because that's how you free up all the", "61:17", "energy it's like if you're trying to", "61:18", "control everything all the time you're", "61:20", "gonna be really limited in what you can", "61:21", "actually do if you just let go and let", "61:24", "things be as they are you're kind of", "61:26", "like it's like you're conserving all", "61:28", "this deep deep well of energy that's", "61:30", "there and then when you really do need", "61:31", "to make a move because it does fucking", "61:33", "matter then you've got the energy to act", "61:35", "and you act in a way that's probably", "61:36", "more effective as it's less distorted so", "61:39", "it's just skillful use of energy and", "61:41", "that's actually that's what I've learned", "61:43", "from practice and even from getting", "61:44", "older because I'm 46 now and I don't", "61:46", "have the energy I used to have it's like", "61:48", "choosing your battles and didn't seem",

"61:57", "I need to do when I need to do it that's", "61:58", "kind of that maturity is sort of I think", "62:00", "a big part of the", "62:02", "the meditative like learning also it's", "62:04", "so interesting what you're talking about", "62:06", "is as it relates to like how when you're", "62:09", "on Good Morning America like it's sort", "62:11", "of figuring out a way to just be in the",

them", "62:53", "trained into a way where they're a", "62:55", "pathway that you can almost observe like", "62:58", "you you are an observer and a passenger", "63:01", "as much as you're the driver of the", "63:03", "experience that it's all just sort of", "63:05", "taking place and when you start tweaking", "63:07", "and freaking out about it that's when", "63:09", "everything tightens up and that's when", "63:11", "you start to run into all these like", "63:13", "real issues with training well that's", "63:15", "why I find basic you know we've talked a", "63:18", "lot about Jeff has

what", "79:29", "is it can we distill those lessons you", "79:30", "know well I think in a lot of ways it's", "79:32", "an exploration of the mind you know and", "79:34", "I think comedies an

punch our boss in the face", "94:10", "or we can't run or whatever and this is", "94:12", "what same as when we were kids we just", "94:14", "swallow it up we swallowed up and the", "94:16", "and that

"little bit dreamy and so somatic", "94:35", "experiencing is a whole way of working", "94:37", "with it we're basically it's sort of", "94:38", "like exposure therapy but it wouldn't", "94:40", "it's not it's not the same it's like", "94:42", "it's all in the it's very meditative", "94:44", "it's like you're working with somebody", "94:46", "and they and they go okay why you come", "94:49", "into the room where do you feel", "94:49", "comfortable sitting it's like oh I I", "94:51", "felt comfort of sitting over here why", "94:52", "did you sit there well I kind of like", "94:55", "have my back to the wall well what is it", "94:56", "about having your back to the wall it", "94:57", "makes you feel more comfortable I just", "94:59", "feel this and it's like well then what's", "95:01", "the Optimates the discomfortable thing", "95:02", "and then you and you notice what it", "95:04", "would feel like to be uncomfortable", "95:04", "there and you basically find a spot in", "95:07", "your experience in your consciousness", "95:08", "which is very centered and comfortable", "95:11", "and then you find that the problem and", "95:13", "you try to simultaneously notice both at", "95:15", "the same time and basically all the", "95:17", "trapped energy of the neural", "95:19", "place starts to drain out that making", "95:21", "sense I'm trying to make it vivid or", "95:23", "visual but

lid off trauma it says trauma", "95:44", "is gonna be different for every person", "95:46", "all traumas is just shock to the nervous", "95:48", "system it's not just about you know", "95:49",

just", "96:12", "just keeps causing havoc in the system", "96:15", "that's the thinking of somatic", "96:17", "experiencing it's and I've been working", "96:19", "with somebody and I had a I mean just to", "96:21", "give him to make it real I had a I've", "96:23", "had a lot of injuries in my life like", "96:25", "broke a neck and broke busted shoulder", "96:27", "and different things from just

when you", "96:59", "look this way and I it was like I", "97:01", "started looking this way it was harder", "97:03", "do and suddenly I remembered the fucking", "97:05", "impact of this truck from when I was 17", "97:07", "years old on this side of my body", "97:09", "and I could feel that the impact was", "97:12", "still in my body and she got me to work", "97:15", "to turn my head and

then let my body kind of a heal", "119:57", "itself help itself out figure itself out", "119:58", "and the meds might buy me time to do", "120:00", "that then they and the meditation can be",

direction that's", "120:26", "not really a problem so much anymore", "120:28", "like I've learned to the problems there", "120:30", "were more like you disappoint people you", "120:32", "feel like you can't get your shit", "120:33", "together you know you're just manured", "120:37", "that can happen and and that back and", "120:40", "create its own challenges but the energy", "120:41", "ones are more fundamental it's like I", "120:43", "wake up in the morning you know maybe", "120:45", "once every week or two and all of a", "120:47", "sudden I can feel my heart pounding and", "120:49", "I

of", "121:22", "like hi and in in a way that and I and I", "121:25", "didn't have my shit together at all and", "121:27", "then I end up in the downswing which is", "121:29", "the the catastrophizing the like the", "121:33", "despair sometimes like you know I still", "121:35", "only lose like that thing about being in", "121:37", "the center that was talking about when", "121:38", "it's there it's so true and it's so", "121:40", "there and all of a sudden I'm not there", "121:42", "at all I don't feel anything there's I", "121:44", "feel like there's no meaning to anything", "121:45", "and I am just in this desolation thing", "121:48", "and that lasts for a few hours or like a", "121:50", "day or something and then I'll pop out", "121:52", "and I'm fine and I know that once a week", "121:54", "or once", "121:55", "every week two weeks or something I'm", "121:56", "gonna go into that cycle now I've done", "121:58", "my whole life without having I've tried", "122:00", "to manage it entirely with meditation", "122:01", "with exercise with diet and I may just", "122:04", "continue to keep doing that have you", "122:06", "gotten better at it I have got well so I", "122:08", "have gotten better at managing it", "122:09", "absolutely no question I've gotten way", "122:11", "better at not believing in it when I'm", "122:13", "in a high and not believing when I'm", "122:14", "ended down I don't wanna interrupt you", "122:16", "but the thought process like what when", "122:18", "it kicks in like you know what are you", "122:20", "aware of it so yeah it starts as and who", "122:23", "I am because I starts as energy in the", "122:25", "body so I feel the vibrating this I'm", "122:26", "like okay that's the vibe first my early", "122:28", "warning sign and then it gets bigger and", "122:30", "bigger but the thing is it's addictive", "122:32", "do you mind your heart rate well this is", "122:35", "a no but I can feel the fucking heart", "122:36", "sometimes is going like a jackhammer and", "122:38", "other times the heart it cools out but", "122:40", "that it's like the I mean you know the", "122:42", "power is still there the feeling of and", "122:45", "that's that feeling of power which is", "122:46", "very once you workout when that hit", "122:48", "that's - that is what I do I hit a", "122:50", "punching bag and the best fuck so I this", "122:52", "have been the best thing in the world", "122:53", "for me is been hitting a punching bag", "122:54", "and it's men meditation can't do shit", "122:56", "when I'm in that place right but", "122:58", "punching bag I feel calm and centered", "123:00", "afterwards so that is the main", "123:01", "intervention of what I'm doing I may", "123:03", "never go the med route I think I can", "123:05", "handle it like I've been doing it until", "123:07", "now", "123:08", "but what makes me want to do it is I", "123:10", "want to know what other people have to", "123:11", "deal with like I want to know what is", "123:13", "like to be on those things and what and", "123:14", "so I can help those people maximally and", "123:17", "say this is what I can tell you about", "123:18", "what meditation can do and this is what", "123:20", "I can tell you about what it can't do", "123:21", "this is what I can tell you about how", "123:23", "physical practice can help but how they", "123:24", "might not be able to help this is what I", "123:25", "can say about how meds have helped in", "123:27", "heaven but so it's if I can have get", "123:29", "experience with those different things", "123:30", "and talk to lots of other people who've", "123:32", "done it then I can triangulate it on", "123:34", "helping people up most in a in a more", "123:36", "effective way so when you get these", "123:37", "surges you know this energy surge you", "123:40", "exercise you hit the bag and you feel", "123:43", "great yeah does that even everything out", "123:45", "yeah yeah usually it can discharge the", "123:48", "energy then why on earth would you be", "123:49", "thinking about theum well that seems", "123:52", "insane because that is a very organic", "123:54", "solution to this problem but I don't", "123:56", "know that it always will work with the", "123:57", "punching bag so it's working right now", "123:59", "it hasn't perfectly worked every time", "124:01", "what's you say hasn't person so", "124:04", "sometimes I go and I hit the bags and", "124:05", "afterwards the energy is still in me it", "124:07", "may not have this", "124:08", "but it's still I can still feel it and", "124:11", "when you say energy is really", "124:13", "interesting to someone who doesn't get", "124:15", "these marriages I want I'm just trying", "124:17", "to like do you feel like you're on", "124:19", "caffeine do you feel like you like a", "124:21", "speed thing speed it feels like nowhere", "124:24", "so you wake up and you're on speed I'm", "124:25", "on speed and that's and there's nothing", "124:27", "I did externally nothing how didn't do", "124:30", "anything all of a sudden so this is the", "124:32", "things their corresponding thought", "124:33", "process that goes with this is there a", "124:35", "zest for life is fucking life yeah some", "124:38", "tomato kick some ass yeah it's a it's", "124:40", "pure exuberance that sounds great it is", "124:43", "great but that's the problem of it it's", "124:45", "great so you feed it so you're like you", "124:46", "want more of it so you just it's like so", "124:49", "basically it's like this it's also not", "124:50", "always great for the people around it's", "124:52", "not always great for the people around", "124:53", "you right right we have our ups and", "124:56", "downs yeah this is like boom boom and", "124:59", "the more you feed the up the higher you", "125:02", "go but that means that the bigger you", "125:03", "have to fall mmm so like that's what", "125:06", "I've learned is that when I when I feed", "125:08", "the grandiosity the energy that", "125:10", "exuberance like I'm super fun to be with", "125:12", "at parties for sure like I'll do crazy", "125:14", "shit that's usually when I've had all my", "125:16", "injuries like my various breaks because", "125:18", "I've been on one of these crazy high so", "125:19", "that's another reason not to do it but", "125:21", "inevitably there's gonna be a part where", "125:22", "it it's gonna crash so so now my whole", "125:25", "job isn't from being a meditation", "125:27", "teacher is I feel the energy start to", "125:29", "come up and I back off so it's like I", "125:31", "let it just come through me I try to let", "125:34", "it just come up like a wave and just and", "125:37", "I and I and it's really uncomfortable", "125:38",

"125:47", "to kind of let it so I just try to keep", "125:49", "myself calm and centered and I try to", "125:51", "let it just feed itself through and now", "125:54", "with the punching bag or with the biking", "125:55", "and with these things that really can", "125:57", "help with that process so I do think I", "125:59", "might be on the verge of maybe I won't", "126:02", "do that maybe I won't but I don't know", "126:05", "because it's the thing is dude it's", "126:06", "fucking hard being at talk to anyone", "126:08", "who's bipolar or being up in those ups", "126:10", "and downs it's hard

"126:47", "like the lots of the energy but I don't", "126:49", "go into total craziness and biologically", "126:52", "what is the process like what is", "126:54", "actually happening to you yeah causing", "126:56", "this I don't know", "126:58", "there's no they don't understand that no", "127:00", "I mean I mean so this is new for me I'm", "127:03", "just I just found out two weeks so I", "127:04", "haven't really done the research on the", "127:06", "brain science yet they do say there's a", "127:08", "brain signature just like there is for a", "127:09", "DD for bipolar there's a particular", "127:12", "signature of what of what it looks like", "127:15", "as some kind of dampening of the frontal", "127:17", "activity so probably a lot of activation", "127:19", "and maybe the amygdala or something I", "127:21", "don't know all I know is from the inside", "127:24", "it really feels different it feels like", "127:26", "I mean it's I mean sure people can", "127:29", "relate like when you've had a coffee and", "127:31", "you got that vibrating energy or you", "127:33", "have or you're feeling super confident", "127:36", "that your confidence goes too far you're", "127:39", "a little bit like overconfident you know", "127:41", "you're your conclusion delusional it's a", "127:44", "and then that and that actually happens", "127:46", "in meditation too like that

you oh yeah I understand", "127:55", "it's like what Dan said yeah they're", "127:56", "gonna put a fucking plaque here on the", "127:57", "wall I'm the best meditator on the", "127:59", "planet like cuz you got you're just you", "128:01", "know you're just all that energy is", "128:03", "coming through you and then inevitably", "128:05", "there was the crash so actually that is", "128:08", "why I didn't get diagnosed for so long I", "128:10", "thought it was just meditation and then", "128:12", "it was I was just noticing the cycles", "128:14", "because of my meditation and it was", "128:16", "really just a DD and it wasn't until it", "128:18", "started to just to become I started to", "128:20", "see okay there is a real pattern here", "128:21", "like I need to just talk to somebody and", "128:23", "get some other perspectives on this I", "128:26", "just might work it's worth pointing out", "128:28", "that it's highly unusual and very", "128:31", "courageous for somebody in Jeff's",

people who are willing to say you", "128:42", "know I deal with anxiety depression", "128:45", "bipolar a DD but for somebody's a", "128:49", "meditation teacher to do it because as", "128:52", "Jeff
