it's because they", "44:29", "have the most stringent rules and", "44:32", "because they have the best medical staff", "44:35", "and the best referees and all that stuff", "44:37", "but it's also just

like", "44:56", "pick up an arm like the old pro", "44:58", "wrestling move like they would check to", "45:00", "see if the guy was still awake I did", "45:01", "pick the arms come back but they do

people", "45:15", "are tough they don't want to tap and", "45:17", "then you end up going to sleep Holly", "45:18", "Holm when she fought Miesha Tate", "45:20", "Miesha Tate choked her unconscious

drownings like", "45:32", "watching someone drown yeah you know so", "45:35", "it's just you know you have a preference", "45:38", "for how you die drowning drownings my", "45:42", "one of my least favorite seems like it", "45:44", "would suck yeah yeah I don't want to do", "45:46", "that yeah I have a buddy's a big wave", "45:48", "surfer and like 40-foot waves shout-out", "45:53", "to Kyle and he did breath-holding course", "45:57", "and he can hold his breath for five", "45:58", "minutes", "45:59", "Jesus because he goes you know if you", "46:01", "get caught on one of those waves you", "46:02", "like down in the deep for a long time", "46:06", "yeah yeah some really interesting he was", "46:09", "telling me some really interesting", "46:10", "things like when a human being puts

"46:23", "back just automatically we've got a lot", "46:26", "of seemingly evolutionary adaptations to", "46:29", "living in the water yeah have you ever", "46:32", "heard that aquatic ape theory sure does", "46:35", "that make any sense does it fit someone", "46:37", "should have already known that already", "46:39", "it makes here's what it does in my", "46:42", "opinion it we should explain it yeah the", "46:45", "idea is I first read about it in a book", "46:47", "by Buckminster Fuller actually great you", "46:51", "know about him yes genius the idea is", "46:54", "that there according to people who", "46:57", "support this theory there was a period", "46:59", "in human evolution where our ancestors", "47:03", "lived in tidal areas so they spent most", "47:07", "of their time in the water that was", "47:09", "about body temperature so it was", "47:12", "comfortable and it was shallow enough", "47:15", "that they weren't worried about sharks", "47:16", "coming in and deep enough that leopards", "47:19", "and other predators from the land", "47:20", "couldn't get at them so it was safe in", "47:22", "that respect also you have great sight", "47:25", "lines so you can see if something's", "47:27", "coming from a long way off and there's", "47:28", "lots of food there lots of mollusks and", "47:30", "fish and you can net and so it sort of", "47:33", "made sense that they would be there and", "47:35", "so we have these physiological", "47:38", "adaptations for aquatic living like for", "47:41", "example human infants are the only Apes", "47:44", "certainly I don't know primate probably", "47:46", "the only primates that know to hold", "47:49", "their water or hold their breath", "47:51", "underwater mmm so like that great", "47:53", "Nirvana album cover of the baby so you", "47:56", "take a baby and drop them in water and", "47:58", "it holds its breath right it's just", "48:00", "temperature you can die yeah whoops yeah", "48:03", "Jim Stone can't even swim so there's", "48:07", "that there's the fact that babies are", "48:08", "really fat so they float you can't teach", "48:11", "chimps to swim no and also chimps don't", "48:14", "have enough body fat to be buoyant right", "48:16", "they're super", "48:18", "corded steel yeah their bodies yeah yeah", "48:21", "I didn't know they could never teach", "48:22", "them to swim that makes sense though but", "48:24", "they're so smart I guess they just can't", "48:26", "do it huh", "48:27", "I don't know but yes if you see lots of", "48:29", "you know contemporary zoos they have the", "48:31", "chimps surrounded by a moat right that's", "48:35", "the moat Wow what a bummer", "48:37", "they'll wade in water I've seen chimps", "48:40", "waiting but that's onesy you know maybe", "48:42", "then there's also the connection between", "48:44", "eating fish and fish oil and brain", "48:48", "health right and there's a very strong", "48:50", "correlation between fish oil and brain", "48:52", "health yeah so it could be related to", "48:54", "fatty hello yeah", "48:56", "and also you would have to be clever to", "49:00", "try to dive into the water to go after", "49:02", "those things the smarter ones would", "49:04", "probably survive right even the nostrils", "49:07", "like you know aybe nostrils come", "49:09", "straight out in the face and the idea of", "49:11", "our nostrils facing down is related to", "49:14", "this aquatic Wow explanation the oil", "49:17", "glands that we have on our heads and", "49:19", "faces and shoulders that you know cause", "49:21", "acne and stuff and teenagers you know", "49:25", "that's for protection from the Sun", "49:27", "apparently so there are lots of", "49:29", "adaptations that seem to fit into this", "49:31", "interpretation but you know lots of the", "49:34", "sort of mainstream evolutionary", "49:35", "theorists would say well wait a minute", "49:37", "you know there are other adaptations we", "49:39", "don't have and that we would have if", "49:42", "that had been the case so it's it's", "49:44", "controversial at best part of it was", "49:46", "also the theory that the human brain in", "49:49", "order for us to be born vaginally the", "49:52", "brain could only be so big before the", "49:54", "kid was born right well that's so much", "49:56", "yeah I mean that's the explanation for", "49:59", "why humans are born helpless right no", "50:01", "but what I'm saying is that we really", "50:03", "can't the brain can't get any bigger", "50:05", "right like the vaginal canal unless our", "50:08", "dicks get bigger and the vaginas get", "50:10", "bigger as well", "50:10", "I still hold bit about that about dick", "50:13", "pills but if there really were dick", "50:15", "pills no one's stopping at one like", "50:18", "what's the dosage okay how much gives me", "50:20", "a stroke I'm gonna take one less than", "50:22", "that all the fucking dice yeah or risk", "50:25", "it and the idea would that be every", "50:27", "dudes dick would just become a super", "50:28", "dick and every woman would be you know", "50:30", "she", "50:31", "it was a joke about flying squirrel", "50:33", "pussy people they would just jump dudes", "50:35", "with big dicks and shopping carts we", "50:36", "chased these girls to the edge of cliffs", "50:38", "then women would leap off whether Aegina", "50:42", "have to morph it have to change for the", "50:44", "big dick pills but it doesn't it does", "50:46", "seem like if humans are gonna get", "50:49", "smarter if the head is gonna have to get", "50:51", "larger does that make any sense or is", "50:54", "that just a crude way of looking at the", "50:55", "brain is it possible that people can get", "50:57", "smart we evolved yeah if we evolved from", "51:00", "lower hominids it's generally assumed", "51:02", "that those lower hominids had little", "51:04", "brains or littler brains than us right", "51:06", "up until like Australia Pittacus or", "51:08", "something yeah what really seems to", "51:10", "matter though is the ratio of brain size", "51:12", "to body size right there are plenty of", "51:15", "animals that have bigger brains than us", "51:16", "that aren't just obviously aren't", "51:19", "smarter than us like elephant elephants", "51:22", "blue whales I mean a blue whale brains", "51:23", "probably the size of this room do we", "51:25", "know if elephants are fucking super", "51:26", "smart because isn't the thing about", "51:28", "intelligence is not just like there's", "51:31", "communication between elephants for sure", "51:33", "and you know that they recognize each", "51:36", "other after long periods of time yeah", "51:37", "like 20 years apart they get together", "51:39", "and they see each other and recognize", "51:41", "each other instantly sure so there's a", "51:42", "there's an intelligence that but but we", "51:44", "judge intelligence oftentimes depends on", "51:47", "whether or not it can communicate with", "51:49", "you whether or not it changes its", "51:51", "environment builds a structure I mean", "51:54", "that's to me this is one of the deepest", "51:56", "questions in life do you see the", "51:59", "elephant that painted a picture of it's", "52:00", "sure yeah that's crazy", "52:02", "yeah and Thailand I think yes yeah pull", "52:04", "that up that is one of those things we", "52:06", "go okay wait a minute", "52:07", "a dog can't do that I thought you said", "52:09", "this thing was as smart as a dog because", "52:12", "that's yeah that's a hundred times and", "52:14", "there are like grey parrots that have", "52:16", "you know 300 word vocabularies or", "52:18", "something yeah I mean I don't don't", "52:20", "quote me on the number but Jamie can", "52:22", "look that up there's they can speak a", "52:23", "whole like sentence yeah and they can", "52:25", "and there's a guy I remember seeing this", "52:28", "recently there's a guy as a border", "52:29", "collie who obviously can't talk but", "52:33", "understands well over a hundred words", "52:36", "and so what he'll do is like you'll put", "52:38", "all these different toys behind a wall", "52:40", "and you'll say go get me the the yellow", "52:42", "bunny and there's like a yellow bunny a", "52:44", "red button", "52:44", "in a green bunny in addition to hundreds", "52:46", "of other shit and the dog will go find", "52:48", "the yellow bunny and bring it back", "52:49", "whoa you know go get me the you know the", "52:51", "green turtle and you'll go get it so the", "52:54", "dog knows those words right and also the", "52:57", "dog sees in color I guess it's a", "52:59", "predator I guess I've never seen color", "53:01", "yeah I think so here's the the elephant", "53:03", "painting itself it is fucking crazy", "53:08", "because it really looks like itself and", "53:11", "this guy helps it and gets the brush and", "53:14", "puts it in its hand but the elephant is", "53:16", "essentially doing

because", "80:26", "the ostensibly the main reason is I'm", "80:29", "using handheld now because my whole", "80:30", "thing's mobile right right right", "80:32", "people who occasionally come to my place", "80:33", "in Topanga but normally I go to them and", "80:36", "they can't hear when they're they don't", "80:38", "hear so I have to keep like going hey", "80:40", "hey the mic you know there are a lot of", "80:42", "them they're not used to talking on mics", "80:44", "and all that yeah but the other reason I", "80:46", "got it is my buddy Kyle actually pointed", "80:49", "to me that when you both have headphones", "80:51", "you're both in a shared space and you're", "80:55", "much less likely to be thinking about", "80:57", "your phone or whatever cuz you're both", "80:59", "like I don't know what it does but it", "81:01", "seals it off in a way yeah we talked", "81:03", "about that yesterday actually", "81:04", "me and Eddie Bravo talked about it", "81:06", "because he doesn't like to wear them", "81:07", "because he doesn't like the sound of his", "81:08", "own voice", "81:09", "and I said he and I are so comfortable", "81:11", "we've been friends for so long I didn't", "81:12", "we didn't need to wear him but I feel", "81:14", "like when you're having a conversation", "81:15", "with someone it cuts out everything else", "81:18", "right just you two they're like there's", "81:20", "no distractions in the room but if there", "81:22", "were there would be less distracting", "81:23", "because they had phones well that's the", "81:25", "thing I'm out like sitting in a campsite", "81:27", "somewhere or by a river or whatever", "81:30", "there's a lot going on yeah the handheld", "81:32", "microphone too is a big thing and if you", "81:34", "get a mic that picks up everything then", "81:35", "they pick up everything everything like", "81:37", "they pick up some shit over by the", "81:39", "outhouse you'd hear in the background", "81:40", "yeah I was using lapel mics for a while", "81:43", "but they were on the directional is too", "81:45", "much and people were complaining and", "81:47", "like dude I can't in the car I can't", "81:49", "hear it is an interesting thing right", "81:53", "because this is not something that a", "81:54", "production company would ever get", "81:56", "together and fund because they would say", "81:59", "if they did they'd have a sound guy and", "82:01", "they'd have a can't like half the fun is", "82:03", "watching you well well this one sucked", "82:05", "is these mics are bullshit yeah alright", "82:07", "we're not doing that anymore you know", "82:08", "like we've done a few from an iPhone we", "82:11", "used to do podcasts on a plane like we'd", "82:13", "be you know me and Duncan or me and Ari", "82:15", "or whoever was would be on a plane next", "82:16", "to each other I just take the iPhone", "82:18", "between us press record and start", "82:20", "talking and voice notes", "82:21", "yeah

"talking into it and I threw it up yeah", "82:30", "and people like it because they know one", "82:32", "thing they know this is one of the", "82:34", "things that's appealing about podcasts", "82:35", "in general is that it's not produced", "82:37", "right it's just this is what it is you", "82:39", "know it's like you got an idea and I'm", "82:41", "getting it right from Chris Ryan's head", "82:42", "it's going right from his head right in", "82:44", "that phone that's going right into my", "82:46", "ears there's nothing there's no filters", "82:48", "there he's getting right into your head", "82:49", "it's one of the weirdest things about", "82:50", "podcasts in general is that that the", "82:52", "intimacy of your voice in someone else's", "82:55", "head like I'm sure when you meet them", "82:57", "they get weirded out right a lot of", "82:58", "people get weird because in their head", "83:00", "you're right", "83:01", "yeah hey like yeah and it's it's strange", "83:05", "like they know you", "83:06", "yes you know and they really do know you", "83:09", "it's not like Fame where you're an actor", "83:12", "right and people like oh I know your", "83:13", "face

"83:33", "about everything like my impulses like I", "83:36", "a nothing guy no secrets because I feel", "83:38", "like there's a like a revolutionary", "83:41", "shamelessness mm you know I feel like I", "83:44", "feel so privileged and largely thanks to", "83:47", "you and Duncan honestly when I started", "83:49", "the podcast and you guys did that shrimp", "83:51", "parade thing and that really built up my", "83:53", "audience and to the point now where it", "83:56", "paid it's self-sustaining and right it's", "83:58", "my main gig that's awesome", "83:59", "it is awesome it's incredible but it's", "84:02", "like I feel like there's a", "84:03", "responsibility I have in a way to", "84:05", "express ourselves shamelessly because", "84:09", "everybody else has a job they can get", "84:11", "fired from right or a marriage that they", "84:14", "can get you know screwed the wife can", "84:17", "leave them or they can right I'm", "84:18", "invulnerable and so I kind of feel like", "84:21",

"84:31", "about shit that other people don't talk", "84:32", "about so that it's out there right and", "84:36", "so my impulse is to just say everything", "84:37", "you know and my sex life is really has", "84:40", "been very interesting and I'd like to", "84:42", "talk about it more but I I don't want to", "84:45", "you know other people never sort of said", "84:48", "they were down for that you know so", "84:50", "that's that's magnified when you have", "84:52", "children because they they have no say", "84:55", "well that's the other vulnerability they", "84:57", "put their kids out there okay I don't", "85:00", "know I'm not saying it's the worst thing", "85:02", "to do but it's not the child's choice", "85:03", "and they're very young and you're making", "85:06", "a you look like whoever did what they", "85:09", "did to Michael Jackson right yeah one of", "85:12", "the things that they did is they made", "85:13", "him famous way before he had", "85:15", "the idea what the fuck that meant and", "85:16", "they profited off of it yeah they kind", "85:18", "of pimped him out right and that's kind", "85:20", "of what's happened and they destroyed", "85:21", "him yeah ultimately the whole thing", "85:23", "destroyed him right and I just I don't", "85:28", "want to be a part of that I just there's", "85:29", "no heart I don't think it's intelligent", "85:31", "and I also don't this is my real honest", "85:35", "feelings I do not think that Fame is I", "85:39", "don't think that people should aspire to", "85:41", "it I think it should be something that", "85:43", "happens if people like your work and", "85:45", "then it's cool that's fine but I think", "85:48", "there's way too much emphasis put on", "85:52", "just trying to get attention and it's", "85:55", "being rewarded and supported in this", "85:58", "weird way there's nothing wrong with", "85:59", "getting attention but it should make", "86:02", "sense it should make sense there should", "86:04", "be some reason and if it's out of", "86:05", "balance no you know you should you", "86:08", "should probably look at like why why is", "86:11", "it out of balance like yeah and lots of", "86:14", "things that attract attention are not", "86:16", "things that we need we we want more of", "86:19", "it's you know like conflict yes", "86:22", "conflict that's a big one but it's also", "86:24", "the I like just Fame itself one of the", "86:29", "weirdest parts about it is that you have", "86:32", "to constantly be checking yourself like", "86:35", "all these people are nice to you all", "86:37", "these people are saying nice things to", "86:39", "you or being mean to you you know one of", "86:41", "the all people that you don't even know", "86:42", "so you can't rely on them for your", "86:45",

"86:52", "you're in this weird position you have", "86:55", "to be very careful with who you", "86:57", "communicate with because one of the", "86:59", "weirdest things you'll see from famous", "87:00", "people is all the sudden they get this", "87:03", "very strange thing where they feel like", "87:06", "people are supposed to do things for", "87:07", "them and you know they don't they're not", "87:09", "supposed to pay for things and", "87:11", "everything's supposed to be easy and", "87:13", "they're supposed to get that that's so", "87:15", "that's a weird one like they they don't",

the first I", "163:43", "think he's the first person to figure", "163:44", "this out certainly the first time I read", "163:46", "it like some Islands some cultures are", "163:49", "cannibalistic and others aren't right", "163:50", "why is that like I'd never thought about", "163:53", "it like why would the Aztecs", "163:56", "the their victims but the Christians", "163:59", "didn't but the Christians killed a lot", "164:01", "more they just left him to rot on the", "164:02", "field why is that the Aztecs are", "164:05", "particularly evil or something I don't", "164:06", "know he applied this prism to it and", "164:11", "showed that also in the South Pacific", "164:13", "there are some islands that were the", "164:15", "people are cannibalistic and other", "164:16", "islands where they weren't and so he", "164:18", "looks at all these and what he figured", "164:19", "out was that in the places where people", "164:20", "are cannibalistic there are no", "164:25", "domesticated animals that eat different", "164:29", "food than humans so for example you", "164:31", "can't raise dogs for meat because dogs", "164:34", "eat what we", "164:35", "so it doesn't make sense but you can", "164:37", "raise goats for me because goats eat", "164:38", "shit humans donee right so in the places", "164:42", "that are cannibalistic there was no", "164:44", "nothing they could domesticate for", "164:47", "protein so when he killed a human you", "164:49", "ate him because your protein starved", "164:53", "isn't that crazy", "164:55", "so it's an ecological thing the Aztecs", "164:57", "had no pigs right there's nothing they", "165:01", "could domesticate no cattle they had", "165:03", "turkeys I think was the only one they", "165:05", "had a meat from a person that killed", "165:07", "they were so psyched just not just gonna", "165:09", "let it go yeah yeah they ever tell you", "165:12", "that's the case with bears the Bears", "165:14", "were all cannibals

"165:46", "guys come out of the den looking for", "165:49", "Cubs the the Correll spring bears yeah", "165:52", "they do it for two reasons they do it", "165:53", "one they they know now that it's not", "165:56", "just to try to force the female into", "165:58", "estrus again right they used to think it", "166:00", "was just that but now they like if you", "166:02", "shoot a bear other bears will claim it", "166:04", "as theirs and start eating it and you", "166:06", "have to chase them off like there it's", "166:09", "the world of a bear is so fucking hard", "166:13", "scrabble and so

tree", "166:59", "right that's true and a lot of times", "167:00", "when the black bears are near people the", "167:03", "reason is because people have encroached", "167:04", "on their their areas and
