a guy", "05:18", "named John Lilly who is a scientists and", "05:20", "a real freak like a guy who is just", "05:22", "really out there really fascinating guy", "05:25", "and he wrote a book that I picked it up", "05:28", "on I think like amazon.com like the used", "05:32", "books that they'll sell yeah like people", "05:33", "sellers individual sellers are selling", "05:35", "and it's the deep self and in it he", "05:38", "talks about the benefits of the tank it", "05:42", "detailed construction on how to make", "05:44", "your own tank he's got like diagrams in", "05:46", "it and just really really fascinating", "05:49", "guy and he was into all sorts of weird", "05:53", "altered states of consciousness and one", "05:56", "of the things that he wanted to figure", "05:57", "out was how to separate the body from", "05:59", "the senses and he came up with a bunch", "06:02", "of different designs there's a movie", "06:03", "altered states that's kind of very", "06:05", "loosely based on you know the idea of a", "06:08", "guy like him going completely haywire", "06:11", "and becoming like a monkey just that's", "06:14", "how I got into sensory deprivation tanks", "06:17", "I saw altered states and they were", "06:19", "historically fairly accurate in the", "06:21", "design of the tanks the initial one that", "06:23", "you saw in altered states showed what", "06:25", "Lily at first came up with which was", "06:26", "like a glass scuba helmet that sort of", "06:30", "suspended him in regular water and he", "06:33", "would actually poop and pee into it he", "06:36", "had like some crazy filtration system so", "06:38", "he could stay in there and", "06:40", "have to defecate or urinate so would go", "06:41", "through some system that he had created", "06:43", "I mean this dude was gone he was off a", "06:46", "d-pad I mean he's about as off the deep", "06:48", "as ever but his his big thing was to try", "06:52", "to figure out how you can get the mind", "06:55", "free of the influence of the body and", "06:57", "the best method he came up to was this", "07:01", "idea of the tank and he figured out", "07:03", "eventually to put salt water in it and", "07:06", "then if you put enough epson salt your", "07:08", "body would float and then he could", "07:09", "maintain the heating temperature -", "07:12", "essentially what's the same temperature", "07:14", "is the surface your skin and you", "07:16", "wouldn't be able to recognize where the", "07:18", "water was and it would give you the", "07:19", "sensation of complete sensory", "07:22", "deprivation that and he figured this out", "07:26", "and from that point on till like god I", "07:30", "don't mean I met you in what was like", "07:36", "how many years ago is it five or six", "07:39", "probably five or six years ago before", "07:40", "that I had that other gentleman who used", "07:43", "to repair tanks for Samadhi who's a", "07:45", "great guy yeah and he he told me about", "07:48", "you and the guy was fixing my Samadhi", "07:50", "tank my smarty tank it fucked up", "07:52", "something something wasn't the tank that", "07:54", "fucked up was the heater like it burnt", "07:56", "through the the lining of the waterbed", "07:59", "and it shorted out the whole thing was a", "08:01", "disaster like sometimes those heating", "08:03", "elements just the pop you know for", "08:06", "whatever reason there's they cook and it", "08:08", "just melted a hole through the thing so", "08:09", "he had to repair it he to repair the", "08:11", "lining and while he's repairing the", "08:12", "lining he goes you know there's this guy", "08:14", "in Venice that makes these like really", "08:17", "high tech tanks and he goes you should", "08:20", "contact him his name is crash he's kind", "08:22", "of an interesting guy and so I asked him", "08:27", "about it and he went adapt about all the", "08:29", "crazy shit that you had done to these", "08:31", "tanks and what they looked like he sent", "08:33", "me to your website and I saw the team", "08:34", "this is pre the stand up tanks they were", "08:37", "still like smaller like ones like", "08:40", "Samadhi but way better constructed you", "08:44", "you had figured out how to do it where", "08:46", "was just like this it looks like a meat", "08:48", "locker", "08:48", "I mean it's so solid and well built and", "08:51", "all your crazy filtration system never", "08:54", "and I realized that you were this one", "08:57", "loan dude out there who was innovating", "09:00", "and it's sort of forgotten business this", "09:02", "sort of forgotten aspect of of", "09:07", "modern-day understanding of the mind I", "09:09", "mean it's really it was ignored", "09:11", "somehow or another I don't know what", "09:13", "happened I don't know how all these", "09:15", "scientists and geniuses missed out on", "09:18", "the sensory deprivation tank promotion", "09:20", "they should have been talking about it", "09:21", "everywhere it is a

want", "89:43", "to look to like you're saying you know I", "89:46", "can remember certainly I wanna get into", "89:47", "this and start talking about certain", "89:49", "things and if people go oh

about it and you", "90:37", "should just go on google and find out", "90:39", "what it actually and there was nothing", "90:40", "this is like 15 years ago", "90:42", "well it's not chemtrails see this is", "90:45", "where people are really confused it's", "90:47", "just airplanes create artificial clouds", "90:49", "and hazy environments if an airplane is", "90:51", "going through the

more than anybody because", "91:00", "you've talked to me about this before", "91:01", "and I know that you probably have these", "91:04", "ideas in your head about the government", "91:06", "spraying

"91:39", "mean this all it is is when in in 2001", "91:43", "when September 11th happened there was", "91:45", "an article that was on cnn.com like a", "91:50", "couple of days afterwards that was", "91:51", "talking about the changes in the", "91:53", "temperature because there weren't the", "91:55", "artificial clouds that were used to", "91:57", "having overhead on a daily basis that",

the", "92:08", "real chemtrails one of the things that I", "92:09", "said on my television show when we", "92:10", "covered this burning jet fuel in the sky", "92:15", "that's the real chemtrail you're we're", "92:17", "polluting the sky and we just love it", "92:19", "because we can get across the country in", "92:21", "in five hours and that's where guys like", "92:23", "Elon Musk and these

they", "92:53", "say oh yeah the the the biggest thing is", "92:55", "the pollution that's", "92:56", "created when the game's blast-off the", "92:58", "amount of whatever goes course fairly", "93:01", "well do it look you see fire yeah you", "93:04", "know nobody sees fire unless something", "93:06", "that's not good is on fire you know if", "93:09", "fires coming out of a metal tube

look", "93:27", "into it and that is true but sometimes", "93:29", "you get caught in a situation where you", "93:31", "don't you know you just still don't", "93:33", "understand even after all the facts are", "93:35", "in well you you also have contrary", "93:38", "opinions that are varied especially when", "93:41", "it comes to like certain historical", "93:42", "events like there's a lot of people that", "93:44", "want to talk about like JFK is a good", "93:46", "example it's a lot of people that love", "93:47", "talking about conspiracies they like", "93:49", "sure wrap that one up

like massive amounts of", "93:59", "confusion as to what the actual events", "94:01", "were but actually so many people wanted", "94:03", "him dad that you can't even pit the pit", "94:05", "you couldn't pin the tail on that donkey", "94:07", "no matter what yeah there was he had", "94:09", "multiple people that were upset with his", "94:11", "action boy would they be so lucky if it",

this", "94:21", "point now if it was a lone nut back then", "94:23", "and the system was actually failsafe", "94:25", "from situations like this I think with", "94:27", "in the 1960s in the death of
