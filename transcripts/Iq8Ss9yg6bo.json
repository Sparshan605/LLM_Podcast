"13:36", "that was specifically like this they", "13:40", "made war and they and they conquered and", "13:42", "when you know when you think about what", "13:44", "they got themselves finally it's about I", "13:46", "said 250,000 square miles this probably", "13:48", "doesn't mean anything but think of West", "13:50", "Texas western Oklahoma western Kansas", "13:53", "eastern Colorado and

"mm-hmm", "14:20", "you know occupying this gigantic area", "14:25", "that that became as we were saying", "14:28", "earlier determinants of everything that", "14:30", "happened around it well your depictions", "14:33", "of how the raid happened where Cynthia", "14:35", "Ann Parker got kidnapped and how all", "14:38", "these other various raids happened was", "14:41", "so terrifying because these people the", "14:43", "initial ones really kind of had no idea", "14:46", "what they were in for these are the", "14:48", "Parkers yeah yes so so the the core so", "14:52", "as I say that my books about the you", "14:54", "know the rise and fall the Comanches is", "14:56", "a tribe which we've been talking about", "14:57", "but then there's this little family the", "14:59", "Parkers and

beyond brave into foolhardy", "15:13", "I mean people if you look at say what", "15:16", "what happened in Canada or what the", "15:18", "Spanish did there was always that you", "15:19", "know the soldiers would ride in first", "15:21", "and set up the Presidio and then the", "15:23", "then the priests would come in and you", "15:25", "know the mission would be set up and", "15:27", "then the

"15:36", "through with no protection of any kind", "15:38", "you know no there were no institutions", "15:42", "they were out beyond any form of", "15:44", "security or protection or institutions",

and", "15:57", "Apaches between where these people were", "15:59", "and and that so you know 800 miles of", "16:02", "nothing and and so what they had done is", "16:05", "they they had taken these

that efficient no for sure not that", "30:29", "efficient but still to me would be kind", "30:31", "of fascinating to see where they are now", "30:33", "I mean the the Native American", "30:34",

"31:35", "wealthy a tribe is now is proximity to a", "31:38", "major urban area for example Chickasaws", "31:41", "and Choctaws are in range of DFW so", "31:44", "their casinos there make a lot of money", "31:47", "the Seminoles in Florida there are some", "31:49", "tribes in California who are making a", "31:51", "lot of money if you go up to say some of", "31:54", "the Sioux reservations you

it out to - usually a", "32:35", "white farmer who would farm it and they", "32:36", "would take a sharecropping percentage or", "32:38", "something but yes so they they didn't", "32:42", "want anything to do with that and and", "32:44", "above all they didn't want to be forced", "32:46", "into a type of life that they that they", "32:48", "had never done before and considered it", "32:50", "just kind of unseemly", "32:51", "so do Comanches have a reservation today", "32:55", "no no reservation at all well the the", "32:58", "problem is the way this is going to get", "33:01", "into a lot of detail but I mean Oklahoma", "33:02", "they basically they they in favor of in", "33:05", "place of reservations they gave out", "33:07", "individual apportionments of land and", "33:10", "had them

probably get it erased there", "33:32", "pretty I mean I think they would they", "33:34", "would tell you I mean I want to speak", "33:36", "for Comanches or anybody else but that", "33:38", "they're that they're you know they're", "33:39", "they're pretty strongly organized where", "33:43", "they are they they have a nation they do", "33:45", "have a nation is just they don't have a", "33:46",

"33:55", "do so if you go for example I spent some", "33:57", "time with the Chickasaws a few years ago", "33:59", "it's incredible now they don't have a", "34:01", "quote reservation either but they have", "34:03", "they have little pieces of land that is", "34:06", "theirs but they also have a completely", "34:08", "parallel police system completely", "34:10", "parallel legislature they have

they may be", "34:21", "are and there are these whole parallel", "34:24", "worlds they're existing right in front", "34:25", "of you and you don't see them Wow there", "34:27", "yes so no I actually I think they're in", "34:31", "a lot of ways a lot of the tribes in", "34:33", "Oklahoma are doing well but you even you", "34:37", "literally can drive through it and you", "34:39", "you wouldn't be able to tell it's just", "34:41", "such a stunning amount of change that", "34:43", "happen to this continent over a short", "34:46", "relatively short period of time yeah I", "34:48", "mean really astounding and and if you", "34:52", "look at what from from the moment that", "34:54", "the last Comanche surrendered with Quan", "34:56", "when quanta and the the last of the", "34:58", "starving have a had all the Buffalo have", "35:00", "been killed now and so they're they're", "35:01", "coming in and it's 1875 you know that", "35:06", "very year their old kind of Maine I", "35:10", "guess camping ground would be Palo Duro", "35:12", "Canyon one of the biggest canyons in the", "35:14", "American West up in the Texas Panhandle", "35:15", "and that's kind of where their their", "35:17",

"35:44", "now we have the cattle drives just", "35:45", "before barbed wire and then there's only", "35:48", "a few years of cattle drives and then", "35:49", "the barbed wire goes up and this

all of your listeners to go", "53:28", "and and look up this guy Lars Anderson", "53:33", "on the Internet yeah he's the he's the", "53:36", "bow guy yeah okay so in him of what he", "53:39", "what he proved among other he went back", "53:41", "and he just researched it and a lot of", "53:43", "the things that I frankly found hard to", "53:45", "believe about Comanches once I saw the", "53:47",

look", "54:15", "at the Anderson video it's really cool", "54:16", "but what that meant was that Jack Hayes", "54:19", "and the Rangers were at an enormous", "54:20", "disadvantage you know and then lo and", "54:24", "behold he yeah well cut to the East", "54:28", "Coast this inventor named Samuel Colt", "54:31", "had come up in the in the early 1830s", "54:33", "with a prototype of a it was a it

saw", "59:15", "Comanches in Texas in 1830s they just", "59:18", "flat couldn't believe what they were", "59:20", "looking at they they couldn't believe", "59:22", "their abilities with horses

cell yeah I think", "59:31", "that was part of the Spanish technology", "59:33", "very very very minimal you'll see it", "59:36", "museums but do you say you can find one", "59:39", "of those yeah I'm a Spanish saddle or", "59:42", "anyway but yeah they they had and but", "59:47", "particularly the the shoe", "59:49", "there it is right there Wow very minimal", "59:51", "minimal yes and one of the ways they", "59:54", "could shoot underneath the the the neck", "59:59", "of the horse was to hang a thong off", "60:00", "side of one of the saddles but a thong", "60:04", "well loop a leather loop a leather loop", "60:08", "that would allow them because otherwise", "60:09", "they they would need to be supported as", "60:11", "they came down underneath them there", "60:13", "were fairly small people they were they", "60:15", "were fairly small people so they're like", "60:17", "they would kind of climb off the saddle", "60:19", "and hang on the side on this side full", "60:21", "gallop full gallop shooting under the", "60:24", "neck accurately arrows that would kill a", "60:27", "man at 30 yards underneath the neck but", "60:29", "people so the question there I don't", "60:31", "know the answer to that and I don't know", "60:33", "that anyone does what the white men saw", "60:36", "just absolutely floored them with", "60:41", "abilities with arrows and among other", "60:42", "things they would you know they would", "60:43", "make the Indian would ask the Indian", "60:45", "voice they set up a dime in a tree or a", "60:47", "coin and they go okay now here you stand", "60:49", "here and like close your eyes and aim", "60:51", "and hit that the Comanche boy would miss", "60:53", "it by the foot look at that picture", "60:55", "right there of them do that's Aristotle", "60:58", "underneath the so basically using the", "61:01", "horse as a shield yeah yeah that's the", "61:02", "whole idea", "61:03", "Wow and there and and if you see them", "61:05", "from the other side I've seen trick", "61:06", "riders do this you can't even see them", "61:09", "mmm from the other side of the horse and", "61:12", "again this was something that you know", "61:13", "trick riders after you know in the Wild", "61:16", "West shows and beyond would do these", "61:18", "sorts of things but I'm sorry so I'll go", "61:21", "back to what you're saying so when they", "61:22", "were standing still oh so where the", "61:24", "Comanche boy asked him to like shoot", "61:25", "that dime and you can see boy wouldn't", "61:27", "hit I mean he was he was - he was", "61:29", "playing by their rules they wanted him", "61:31", "to stand and aim and whatever and again", "61:35", "if you see the Lars Andersson videos", "61:36", "there was no such thing as closing one", "61:38", "eye there was no such thing almost as", "61:39", "standing still and shooting it was", "61:42", "constant movement it was you know", "61:43", "shooting from movement wherever they", "61:45", "were going so and so so we can hear it", "61:48", "that way so it was sort of like the", "61:49", "member in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance", "61:50", "Kid where they say here Sundance try to", "61:52", "hit that and and you know Sundance Kid", "61:56", "shoots at it and misses it and then on", "61:58", "his way out he moves he says you mind if", "62:00", "I move or something or I'm better", "62:02", "if I move it's the same deal yeah it was", "62:04", "all about movement and it was never", "62:06", "about anything stationary mm-hmm anyway", "62:09", "so you know that that dancer I have no", "62:11", "idea how they they got good at that", "62:14", "right that's why it's a real shame that", "62:17", "they don't have a written history yeah I", "62:19", "mean that's one of many many things", "62:21", "that's a real shame that they don't have", "62:23", "a written history because it's and I", "62:24", "would have loved to have seen someone be", "62:27", "able to do that I mean God what how", "62:30", "incredible would it be to see what what", "62:32", "it looked like to see them I mean we're", "62:35", "just we just missed the motion picture", "62:38", "by 6070 here's gonna think they were", "62:40", "doing it for hundreds hundreds and", "62:42", "hundreds use it's almost like just too", "62:44", "magical to capture sorry it's gone", "62:47", "you have gone right before you'd invent", "62:49", "a camera no at least we have some photos", "62:51", "some still photos we do and we have and", "62:54", "I put in pretty big chunks of text into", "62:56", "my book of people of the time who saw", "62:59", "them and to describe it yeah that's all", "63:01", "you can do is yeah this just what they", "63:04", "saw and how astounded they were we must", "63:06", "have been pretty excited when you saw", "63:07", "that Lars Anderson guy oh yeah because", "63:10", "you know I pull that guy up show up pull", "63:13", "up a video of that guy so we could watch", "63:14", "it because it is pretty amazing and", "63:16", "because I mean I it's not that I didn't", "63:18", "believe what I was reading but on some", "63:20", "level it's hard to believe that they can", "63:21", "do what the people said they could do", "63:24", "it's interesting because this guy gets", "63:25", "hated on a lot in the archery community", "63:27", "it's very funny because you know they", "63:30", "say that a lot of what he's doing is", "63:31", "tricks and a lot always doing is", "63:33", "nonsense and you know it's not really", "63:35", "true that people actually did that but", "63:37", "watch him do it yes I said okay ma'am I", "63:39", "mean unless that's a trick I mean he's", "63:43", "clearly doing what he's saying he's", "63:45", "doing there's no if ands or buts about", "63:47", "it yeah are they tricks in terms of like", "63:50", "is it something that like maybe wouldn't", "63:52", "be as effective but it's really cool to", "63:54", "see yeah for sure but so what so what", "63:56", "he's still showing you yeah he's showing", "63:59", "you that you can do things I mean but is", "64:02", "he throws a ball and then shoots look at", "64:04", "he shoot it was look at that he shoot it", "64:07", "in the head with his people also the", "64:09", "rate of discharge which was one of the", "64:10", "things I had trouble believing he when", "64:13", "you see him shoot he's just yeah one", "64:15", "every time", "64:16", "throws it catches it and he can shoot an", "64:18", "arrow like after right after he catches", "64:20", "it look at that how he throws something", "64:22", "in the air and then shoots two shots -", "64:26", "he throws it in the air and then by the", "64:29", "time it hits the ground he hits it twice", "64:31", "means incredible and he's really", "64:34", "accurate with this thing he also one of", "64:36", "his cases is that you know that he is", "64:38", "always moving it's continuous movement", "64:40", "he never he doesn't close one eye he", "64:41", "doesn't stand still he is moving all the", "64:43", "time yeah where he goes which is what he", "64:45", "said was a trademark of the great the", "64:47", "Magyars and the great you know Archer", "64:49", "cultures look at this jumps in the air", "64:51", "gets off an arrow before he hits the", "64:53", "ground I mean amazing and he's even", "64:57", "catching arrows and then shooting them", "64:59", "back like anybody that says that what", "65:02", "he's doing is nonsense is a fool like", "65:04", "look he's mainly doing it you're in you", "65:08", "are an archer yeah archery range back", "65:10", "then okay so you've got it I'm a bow", "65:11", "under yeah well okay that's how this is", "65:15", "really impressive stop for me I don't", "65:17", "shoot traditional archery I shoot a", "65:19", "compound bow with a sight and I can line", "65:21", "it up to the exact yardage and all that", "65:23", "stuff but but I know enough to know that", "65:25", "what this guys doing it's pretty special", "65:26", "so he's showing arrows in the quiver", "65:28", "versus arrows in his hand how he can", "65:30", "just grab him and pull him right so his", "65:32", "his case is that we all think that it's", "65:34", "a quiver right he says nobody nobody was", "65:37", "any good ever used to quiver you can", "65:39", "transport them in a quiver but in battle", "65:40", "you're holding them in a bunch of a", "65:42", "clustered bunch in your hand I was", "65:44", "saying these people here in these", "65:45", "ancient depictions the actual drawings", "65:48", "from you know hundreds of years ago of", "65:50", "the way he did it", "65:51", "holding the arrows in his draw hand and", "65:54", "so he can do it very quickly", "65:56", "really interesting it is really and this", "65:59", "is probably I mean because of this one", "66:01", "gentleman it's probably the only way", "66:03", "we're really gonna know that this was", "66:05", "possible cuz no one else is doing", "66:07", "anything like this guy look at this guy", "66:09", "he's doing drive-bys on a back of a bike", "66:12", "and he hits I mean back that up again so", "66:15", "you could see that because that is", "66:16", "insane watch how he's doing this", "66:18", "right there I mean three times he hits", "66:22", "in in a second he hits three targets on", "66:25", "a bike as he's riding by which would", "66:28", "emulate a horse other", "66:29", "difference between the elevation change", "66:31", "you know you go up and down on a horse", "66:33", "but that was the other thing about like", "66:35", "the stories of the Mongols that they had", "66:37", "developed an ability to shoot as the", "66:40", "horses in the air because it wouldn't", "66:42", "like the the stomping oh I say hubs", "66:44", "would during that part so as the horse", "66:47", "was up that's when they would release so", "66:49", "it would have the least amount of impact", "66:50", "on their their accuracy pretty", "66:53", "incredible stuff but it's one of the", "66:55", "things that made Comanches Comanches the", "66:57", "mastery of the horse Plus that would now", "66:59", "combine with this ability to shoot from", "67:01", "from a moving horse now did they have a", "67:04", "particular prowess with archery that was", "67:07", "was known amongst Native

plenty", "67:20", "of other Indians nobody had ever seen", "67:22", "anything like it at the time now was", "67:24", "there a group in of Northern Plains", "67:26", "Indians that could do I don't know but", "67:28", "but the reaction was almost universal by", "67:31", "people who had seen a lot of Indian", "67:32", "tribes and you know they'd never seen", "67:35", "that before someone needs to make

well you know", "67:54", "Warner Brothers has been working on this", "67:55", "for nine years so yeah I would maybe one", "67:58", "day we can't they came very as I", "68:00", "understand it very soon this book came", "68:02", "out nine years ago right so that's when", "68:04", "Warner Brothers was right and the first", "68:06", "screenwriter was Larry McMurtry it was", "68:08", "very famous you

just", "69:18", "it changed the way I felt and thought", "69:22", "about the whole this whole thing of", "69:26", "these settlers traveling across the", "69:28", "country and encountering these Native", "69:30", "American tribes it changed my home which", "69:32", "completely changed my whole perspective", "69:34", "of that era in time well it's that the", "69:39", "needle sort of swings both ways on this", "69:42", "on the question of a Native Americans", "69:46", "and there as I said there was a there", "69:49", "was sort of a school that was dominant", "69:52", "well if you actually go back you you", "69:54", "have kind of a mid-century impression", "69:56", "that you know sort of the Indians are", "69:57", "all bad and the Army is good right the", "70:00", "Cavalry's
