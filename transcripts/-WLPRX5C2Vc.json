something like he doesn't see how", "24:37", "hunting for elephants is conservation or", "24:40", "or helps wildlife it's a it's a horror", "24:44", "show doesn't you know elephants or any", "24:46", "other animal something like that and I", "24:47", "was like what in the hell is that", "24:49", "what are we talking about no elephants", "24:51", "talk about elephants that's fine", "24:53", "whatever but he said or any other animal", "24:56", "yeah so I took that tweet I posted it", "24:59", "and addressed it and I don't know if he", "25:03", "saw it I don't really know but soon", "25:04", "after that I got a call for this thing", "25:06", "and so because I was you know I know", "25:10", "just from mountain in Africa and how it", "25:12", "works and the hunting is necessary over", "25:16", "there if the animals are going to", "25:17", "survive if if that's a complicated story", "25:20", "yeah a complicated situation but people", "25:23", "people don't want to hear that now and", "25:25", "so here's an example of in Tanzania", "25:29", "there was a the largest hunting", "25:30", "concession and I'm trying to think how", "25:33", "big it was I I can't put the number on", "25:36", "how big it was but they'd been in", "25:38", "business for 40 years so a hunting", "25:39", "concession is is they have you know", "25:41", "hunters from usually America go over", "25:45", "there they pay for that for the access", "25:48", "to the land and they pay for the right", "25:50", "to hunt these animals so this place had", "25:52", "been in business for 40 years they went", "25:55", "out of business because of this import", "25:57", "ban Obama put an import ban on the ivory", "26:01", "of elephants coming back as trophies but", "26:05", "also banned Isis yeah the lion thing was", "26:07", "right after Cecil the lion and it was", "26:09", "done as a political measure right so he", "26:12", "put a ban on you can go over there and", "26:14", "hunt him still because you know we're", "26:17", "from America we can't say what's legal", "26:18", "in Africa but he can say what he did was", "26:22", "say we could hunt him whatever because I", "26:24", "can't control that but you can't bring", "26:25", "him home so nobody's gonna go and spin", "26:28", "and 75,000 kill an elephant or 50,000 to", "26:30", "kill a lion if they can't bring it home", "26:32", "right", "26:33", "so that basically shut down hunting and", "26:37", "this outfit in Tanzania that business", "26:41", "business for 40 years they closed they", "26:44", "went out of business about I think it's", "26:47", "about two months ago now and what", "26:49", "happens is when they don't have a the", "26:51", "concession they can't pay for that land", "26:53", "it is given back to the people and for", "26:57", "us here they'll be like oh that's great", "26:59", "you gave the land back to the people no", "27:01", "it's not good to give the land back to", "27:03", "the people there because that people", "27:04", "can't do anything don't have any money", "27:05", "they don't just like so what happens is", "27:08", "the poachers as soon as the hunting", "27:09", "concession moves out poachers move in", "27:11", "and kill every animal the only reason", "27:14", "the animals that were being protected in", "27:16", "that hunting concession was because", "27:18", "there was hunting in there these this", "27:20", "outfit would spin I think in the last", "27:23", "three years they spent over two million", "27:26", "dollars on anti-poaching efforts so two", "27:29", "million dollars to protect basically", "27:31", "their investment which is those animals", "27:33", "that were in there yeah they'd kill a", "27:35", "couple because because elephants were", "27:37", "hunted and they ran the haunts and", "27:39", "probably Lions but by and large they're", "27:41", "protecting the majority of the herd well", "27:44", "give me give me those numbers again", "27:45", "because you were giving me the numbers", "27:47", "on elephants legally and illegally", "27:48", "killed right so so and I asked this back", "27:51", "at our first international Wildlife", "27:52", "Conservation Council meeting and this", "27:55", "you know PETA was there and all these", "27:56", "animal rights activists I don't wanna", "28:00", "say psychos that could be disrespectful", "28:02", "but anyway these extremists were there", "28:05", "and so it was kind of heated in some", "28:07", "point some cases but I did ask this", "28:09", "question how many elephants are killed", "28:11", "legally in Africa each year and the", "28:15", "number is about four hundred four", "28:17", "hundred to kill legally in the entire", "28:19", "continent yeah yeah area so big you can", "28:23", "get America the United States of America", "28:25", "you can also get all European countries", "28:27", "you can fit a lot of shit in Africa", "28:29", "Africa's huge huge place yeah and so", "28:31", "there's some there's some areas where", "28:33", "you're not gonna hunt elephants because", "28:34", "there's not litter there's not enough of", "28:36", "it or they don't live there but there's", "28:39", "some areas where there's too many", "28:40", "elephants it's just", "28:41", "yeah that's what's confusing to people", "28:43", "people here elephants are going extinct", "28:45", "well yeah they are in some places yeah", "28:47", "and then in other places", "28:48", "the problem is with local farmers they", "28:51", "have these plots of land and the", "28:53", "elephants come in and eat everything and", "28:55", "destroy their land and they can't do", "28:56", "anything about it what are you gonna do", "28:58", "this how the pigs an elephant how many", "28:59", "thousands a pound ten thousand pounds or", "29:01", "some shit I don't even know they're huge", "29:03", "huge but they can't do a goddamn thing", "29:04", "about air about elephants they the", "29:06", "people that they're like the elephant is", "29:08", "ruining my crop yeah that's what I need", "29:10", "to eat yeah", "29:11", "I'm gonna kill the elephants gonna lay", "29:12", "there and rot yeah there's these these", "29:14", "people are starving yeah and it's", "29:17", "there's a food chain going on there and", "29:19", "humans here where we are we're so far", "29:23", "above the food chain that we're like", "29:24", "sitting in a platform looking down", "29:26", "watching it there they're embedded in it", "29:29", "their ground level they'll in there it's", "29:31", "it's the whole it's a whole analogy of", "29:34", "you can't have first world people", "29:37", "solving third world problems yeah that's", "29:39", "you know and it's just we we people here", "29:42", "have all the answers it's like you have", "29:44", "everything you want you have at you live", "29:46", "in excess yeah you're fat you have you", "29:48", "throw food away what are you talking", "29:50", "about you have no idea what it's like in", "29:52", "Africa so they're 400 elephants are", "29:56", "killed legally 30,000 are poached a year", "29:59", "30,000 and the reason that's happening", "30:02", "is because the hunting had to move out", "30:04", "the hunting closed down or hunting is", "30:07", "what pays for the anti-poaching efforts", "30:08", "but when hunting money isn't there the", "30:12", "poachers were in rampant 30,000", "30:14", "elephants that's why they are devastated", "30:16", "is such a not hunting it's such a hard", "30:18", "thing for people to swallow because what", "30:20", "is is from the point of view of someone", "30:22", "who loves wildlife I think this is what", "30:24", "people want what they want is the humans", "30:26", "to leave the animals alone and the", "30:29", "animals to live in this state of bliss", "30:31", "where they exist perfectly and the", "30:34", "balance of nature of predator and prey", "30:36", "all plays out in a natural way without", "30:39", "people going over there and shooting", "30:41", "elephants then sticking their tusks on", "30:43", "their wall yeah I mean we've all seen", "30:45", "those pictures of these giant fat fucks", "30:47", "holding a rifle standing over a lie and", "30:50", "you're like this just looks wrong yeah", "30:52", "it looks like American", "30:54", "gluttony makes its way over to Africa", "30:56", "and some guy shoots a line with a rifle", "30:59", "now he's standing on its head and he's", "31:01", "gonna put it on his wall and it's a fat", "31:03", "fucking house somewhere that bothers", "31:06", "people I get it I get it too I mean I'm", "31:09", "not arguing that well but you got to fix", "31:11", "Africa first yeah and you're not trying", "31:13", "so this idea that if you just leave all", "31:16", "those animals alone and stop hunting", "31:18", "them everything's gonna be fine no", "31:19", "they're gonna be wiped out", "31:20", "you got to people have to look at it", "31:22", "pragmatically first and then", "31:24", "idealistically because pragmatically you", "31:27", "have to understand that these animals 20", "31:29", "years ago were on the verge of", "31:31", "extinction so many different antelopes", "31:33", "so many different what we'd call game", "31:35", "animals animals that people eat we're on", "31:38", "the verge of extinction until they", "31:40", "started instituting these big hunting", "31:42", "concessions and having people come in", "31:44", "from Europe and America and hunting in", "31:46", "Africa then the community started to", "31:49", "prosper because if someone's paying you", "31:51", "know I don't know how much is it to", "31:53", "shoot like a nilgai or something like", "31:55", "that", "31:56", "oh maybe fifteen hundred so think of how", "31:58", "many of those things get shot and some", "32:00", "of that money goes to the ranch some of", "32:02", "that money goes to the professional", "32:04", "hunting guys anti-poaching conservation", "32:06", "efforts and then you have unprecedented", "32:08", "numbers there's more of those animals", "32:11", "today than there have been in decades", "32:12", "yeah and it's all because people put", "32:15", "value on them yeah it's all about the", "32:16", "animals have to have value and people", "32:18", "say no well if the animal has value", "32:21", "being alive it's like okay what does to", "32:23", "you cause to you if you don't live over", "32:25", "there if you're not pouring your choice", "32:26", "not starving to death a picture of an of", "32:29", "a lion is amazing okay and that animal", "32:31", "is beautiful there's a value in it being", "32:34", "alive but you got to understand those", "32:37", "people need to eat they need to work so", "32:39", "if they're not worth working for the", "32:41", "hunting concession", "32:42", "if the hunting concession goes out of", "32:43", "business like the largest one in", "32:45", "Tanzania did after 40 years what are", "32:47", "they gonna do they can't go get a job at", "32:49", "the mill you know what I mean there's no", "32:51", "there's nothing there's not industry", "32:52", "over there so what happens is as they", "32:54", "some of those people and I don't know", "32:56", "for a fact but I would I'm gonna make an", "32:58", "educated guess that they would go from", "33:00", "working as anti poaching officers or or", "33:04", "helping keep the animals alive as part", "33:06", "of the anti poaching program", "33:07", "straight to poaching yeah well that", "33:10", "that's happened back and forth both ways", "33:12", "right yeah former poachers became anti", "33:15", "poaching officers when the opportunity", "33:16", "brought itself", "33:17", "and they were great ones because they", "33:18", "knew how how it worked and they knew", "33:20", "where the weaknesses were and that saved", "33:22", "animals but it's just like it's it's

I don't", "37:02", "I don't want that I mean I would like", "37:04", "them to just exist well the thing yeah", "37:06", "but people aren't gonna contribute that", "37:09", "money just to pay for the anti poaching", "37:11", "just to go take a picture it's like it's", "37:13", "not gonna happen if you go to the", "37:15", "Missouri Breaks or something like that", "37:16", "and you go hunting mule deer like those", "37:19", "that's what I like I like animals that", "37:22", "exist because they that they're there", "37:24", "this is their spot this is where they", "37:26", "are like if you go to the Missouri", "37:28", "Breaks and you go up into those those", "37:31", "hills and look for four mule deer those", "37:34", "fuckers have been there for thousands of", "37:35", "years I mean they've found skulls of", "37:38", "deer of white-tailed deer in Florida", "37:41", "that are 2 million years old right", "37:44", "they're the exact same animal 2 million", "37:46", "years ago so for millions of years", "37:48", "longer than there have been human beings", "37:51", "those things have been in that form", "37:54", "running around North America and", "37:56", "wherever the fuck they can that's what I", "37:57", "like I like that too but don't forget", "38:00", "that hunting has played a part in", "38:01", "keeping those numbers healthy deer and", "38:04", "out there's more deer there's no", "38:06", "big-game animal north big-game animals", "38:09", "in North America now than there were a", "38:10", "hundred years ago", "38:11", "and that's through hunting and", "38:13", "conservation that is true but it's also", "38:15", "because 150 years ago people went", "38:18", "fucking ham yeah wiped out most of them", "38:21", "right it was well real bad one about", "38:23", "weimar hunting before refrigeration", "38:25", "exactly yeah but we've learned from that", "38:27", "we learn ok this is how this is how we", "38:29", "need to do it this is how hunting fits", "38:30", "in this equation and that's where you", "38:34", "know we talked about the International", "38:35", "Wildlife Conservation Council that's", "38:37", "given me a way in to talk about a bunch", "38:40", "of other things too so one of those and", "38:43", "we talk about animals in North America", "38:45", "is ryan zenki who is the Secretary of", "38:47", "Interior he created this new I guess", "38:50", "it's a bill I'm not like this political", "38:53", "expert I'm a bow hunter right I wear a", "38:56", "flannel shirt and baseball hat but he", "38:58", "did create this I'm gonna call it a bill", "39:02", "but that protects the the winter that we", "39:07", "call them wildlife corridor so it's", "39:09", "where the animals can go from the summer", "39:11", "summer range to the winter range where", "39:13", "there's not going to be development", "39:15", "there so he created that because that's", "39:17", "how those animals like in Montana make", "39:19", "it through the winter right if if", "39:21", "they're up in the summer they make it", "39:24", "through getting in fall and then all of", "39:28", "a sudden winter hits they have to have a", "39:29", "way down into the low country to where", "39:32", "they can their winter migration to where", "39:34", "they can survive the snow and where they", "39:37", "can make down and there's good feed down", "39:39", "there if there's gas rigs or mineral", "39:42", "mineral extraction efforts going on that", "39:45", "impede that then they might get hung up", "39:47", "there and get stuck in the snow and die", "39:49", "so he realizes that he realized the need", "39:52", "for that he created this this new", "39:54", "program that's gonna make sure that", "39:56", "there's no development in there it keeps", "39:57", "those corridors open and that's that's", "39:59", "why our numbers do so well is because", "40:02", "there's people like that with the vision", "40:04", "on keeping our animals healthy well this", "40:06", "is another thing that we talked about on", "40:08", "the flight I think is important to bring", "40:10", "up when when there was this talk about", "40:13", "the state monument or the National", "40:14", "Monument Utah and Patagonia put that", "40:17", "thing on their page the president stole", "40:19", "your land yeah explain what actually", "40:21", "happened because it's not what everybody", "40:24", "thinks it is and and Rinella said it", "40:27", "best if you say the president stole your", "40:29", "land you're not being accurate with your", "40:31", "words that's not what happened it was", "40:34", "Patagonia did an awesome marketing job I", "40:37", "mean in that those efforts by saying the", "40:39", "president soldier land from what I've", "40:41", "heard resulted in a 15 percent increase", "40:43", "in business for them so it worked great", "40:46", "but what the truth is is a lot of people", "40:49", "felt like Obama when he before he left", "40:51", "office did an overreach on the National", "40:55", "Monument protection and so there's", "40:58", "protecting a National Monument and then", "41:01", "which is a certain area he protected he", "41:05", "wanted it encompass two million acres in", "41:07", "that National Monument designation which", "41:10", "seems excessive", "41:11", "what Zinke says the Secretary of", "41:14", "Interior he went in there and he said", "41:15", "that's an excessive that's an overreach", "41:17", "I want to scale it back to what it was", "41:19", "before Obama did that now why is it", "41:21", "excessive though this is what gets", "41:23", "confusing to people people think that", "41:24", "protecting land is never excessive right", "41:26", "what he wants to do is make sure people", "41:28", "have access and what and it's like okay", "41:31", "so what's the difference between the way", "41:33", "the way it is under Obama and the way it", "41:35", "is under Zinke it'll be Zinke scaled it", "41:39", "back to what it was before which that", "41:40", "would be a still National Forest still", "41:43", "federal land but you'd be able to and", "41:46", "I'm not sure if it was wilderness or how", "41:50", "the access would be what about what", "41:51", "Zinke would say is that like I would be", "41:55", "able to go into the land all the time", "41:56", "about two million acres because I might", "41:58", "be considered by some to be elite you", "42:00", "know", "42:01", "I can walk for 20 miles not everybody in", "42:04", "the United States can walk 20 miles to", "42:05", "get somewhere so they want to put road", "42:07", "systems there's Road systems already", "42:08", "systems already but wants to maintain", "42:10", "the roads so but if it was a National", "42:14", "Monument right then no road systems like", "42:17", "what is the difference that I think the", "42:18", "road systems would be gated off and it'd", "42:21", "be walking walk you know", "42:23", "foot track traffic only instead of", "42:26", "access through the roads now why did", "42:28", "Obama make it 2 million acres I don't", "42:31", "know and close off the roads I'm not", "42:32", "sure so it's still federal land so it's", "42:34", "not like the government sold the land", "42:36", "off now and no mining permits have been", "42:39", "issued there's no plans to drill or", "42:41", "anything like that no when I when I", "42:43", "looked that up because I was unsure", "42:44", "about and I talked with Zinke about it", "42:46", "just because it's you know I'm learning", "42:48", "all this as we go also and I was", "42:51", "concerned when when I read the", "42:54", "president's told your land I'm like", "42:55", "what's this about and so what it is is", "43:00", "what he what Zinke wants to do is he", "43:02", "wants to just make sure people of not", "43:05", "all abilities because it's not like we", "43:06", "want roads on every mountain but have", "43:09", "access to to national forests so people", "43:12", "that can drive in four by fours you know", "43:15", "those little off-road on existing roads", "43:18", "yeah on existing roads and it's just", "43:21", "like national forests now natural force", "43:22", "now has roads right right", "43:24", "designated wilderness areas because then", "43:26", "I talked about that too I'm like whoa", "43:28", "okay", "43:29", "I understand I understand access I said", "43:32", "that's great I want people to be able to", "43:34", "enjoy the great outdoors also but I also", "43:37", "grew up hunting the ego cap wilderness", "43:39", "which is Oregon's largest wilderness", "43:41", "area three hundred fifty six thousand", "43:43", "acres of no roads and I don't want Rosen", "43:46", "there I don't want access in the middle", "43:49", "of the heart of that wilderness because", "43:51", "it's some of the most pristine beautiful", "43:53", "country in the lower 48 I like it like", "43:55", "that so we still need to be able to", "43:58", "protect those areas but this wasn't in", "44:00", "this one this is bears ears and and Utah", "44:03", "this wasn't changing anything", "44:05", "opening up anything or this big", "44:07", "nefarious plan of of mining and", "44:09", "stripping everything yeah but his work", "44:11", "right right they they were but all I did", "44:13", "it went back", "44:14", "to what it was before and at that time", "44:16", "when I research that there had been no", "44:17", "mining permits that from what I", "44:19", "understand is there is no mineral", "44:21", "there's not in there some minerals in", "44:22", "there but not enough to warrant going in", "44:25", "there and setting up a full mineral", "44:27", "extraction mine so the building reason", "44:31", "that they change the distinction is to", "44:33", "allow people to have more access to that", "44:35", "wilderness through roads that already", "44:36", "has a windy wilderness it'd be National", "44:38", "Forest", "44:38", "okay federal lands yeah so why the", "44:41", "uproar then why is everybody so confused", "44:44", "is it a lack of communication is it a", "44:46", "lack of understanding about what the", "44:48", "difference in the distinctions of the", "44:49", "two things are it's just creating you", "44:53", "know a negative narrative it's saying", "44:55", "it's something changed you know Obama", "44:58", "had it this way Zinke scaled it back", "45:01", "that right there is like why what's", "45:04", "going on not really doing the research", "45:06", "about he's not he's just putting it back", "45:08", "to what it was because he thought that", "45:10", "it was a overreach by Obama so it's just", "45:13", "you know these these outfits they're in", "45:16", "business you know if everything's going", "45:20", "good there's really no reason for people", "45:24", "to get fired up and contribute money you", "45:26", "know some of these some of these it's", "45:28", "political in some respects business is", "45:30", "political that's very cynical though I", "45:32", "see what you're saying but I think that", "45:35", "really what's going on is people are", "45:37", "very concerned and they see any movement", "45:40", "or concern by businesses yeah but even", "45:42", "the businesses like Patagonia's", "45:44", "businesses about the outdoors as their", "45:46", "whole business yeah so they see anything", "45:48", "that's a change and the Trump", "45:49", "administration especially in the", "45:51", "beginning when it came in people were", "45:53", "really worried about them in terms of", "45:55", "environmental concerns because they had", "45:57", "opened up offshore drilling they did a", "45:58", "lot of things that people were really", "45:59", "freaked out about they had opened up", "46:01", "what was the area", "46:02", "jaim\u00e9 in Alaska where they were going to", "46:05", "open up drilling that was near", "46:08", "salmon runs that people were very very", "46:10", "concerned about they were concerned", "46:13", "about the idea of money above nature", "46:15", "yeah like and then I was me too right", "46:17", "and who's making that money you're not", "46:19", "making money now I'm not making any of", "46:20", "that money so someone else is gonna make", "46:22", "money off of what's supposed to be our", "46:25", "land and our public land which you and I", "46:28", "could maybe go even though you don't", "46:29", "like salmon", "46:30", "we could go salmon fishing in this land", "46:32", "well it could get fucked up by someone", "46:34", "else making billions of dollars in oil", "46:37", "or natural gas or whatever the right we", "46:39", "do if they contaminate that I don't want", "46:40", "that no I don't know you don't want that", "46:42", "either in the know from Patagonia you", "46:43", "don't want that either", "46:44", "so when they see something like this", "46:45", "come up their red flags go up they want", "46:48", "to get people outraged they want to get", "46:49", "people activated because they think that", "46:51", "there might be a chance that if you", "46:52", "protest enough you can stop something", "46:54", "like this happening before it does right", "46:55", "because if you do look at like what", "46:58", "happened in Alaska with that big oil", "46:59", "spill in the 80s or what happened with", "47:02", "the BP oil spill in the Gulf Coast like", "47:04", "that shit's devastating yeah once", "47:06", "something like that does happen someone", "47:08", "else is profiting making fucking", "47:11", "billions of dollars while our our planet", "47:14", "that we all share is getting fucked up", "47:16", "you're not making a nickel off of it", "47:18", "I'm not making a nickel off of it", "47:19", "they're making billions of dollars and", "47:21", "they're fucking up the land and by the", "47:24", "government by Trump or anybody else", "47:26", "whoever's opening it up giving them", "47:28", "access to drill right do all this thing", "47:30", "you open up the possibility of ruining", "47:32", "something that's amazing well so there's", "47:35", "always going to be a balance though", "47:36", "there's you can't just say okay nobody", "47:39", "can drive past this point forever you", "47:41", "know what I mean there's always so but", "47:43", "you're saying that about the eagle cap", "47:45", "wilderness you don't want the right", "47:46", "drive but there's got to be areas", "47:47", "there's got to be areas we have to", "47:49", "protect wilderness areas but for example", "47:52", "where we've elk hunted in Colorado right", "47:54", "big bowls awesome elk hunting there's", "47:57", "natural gas wells all over right it's", "48:00", "great elk hunting yeah they've got so", "48:02", "they're not yeah they're not fucking it", "48:04", "up so I'm yeah I don't want things wiped", "48:07", "out in a huge mineral extraction mine", "48:10", "right where there's used to be beautiful", "48:12", "whatever I don't want that beautiful", "48:14", "rivers that are polluted right now but", "48:16", "you can't just say we're not doing", "48:17", "anything anywhere mm-hmm it doesn't work", "48:20", "so there can be a balance just like that", "48:22", "where we've hunted in Colorado there can", "48:23", "be a balance but the real concern that", "48:25", "the average person has me included is", "48:27", "that someone is going to profit and by", "48:30", "doing that we're where it's not gonna", "48:32", "benefit you or anybody we know it's", "48:34", "gonna fuck it up for everybody else yeah", "48:36", "that's the real concern oh for sure I", "48:38", "know that's why I've tried to you know", "48:41", "that's what I've wanted to be involved", "48:43", "like yeah I'm on that council which has", "48:45", "nothing to do with public lands in North", "48:48", "America but it's given me a way to get", "48:50", "in there and try to learn more that's", "48:51", "all I'm trying to do you also were", "48:53", "involved with when jason Chaffetz had", "48:56", "that proposal in Utah to sell off chunks", "48:59", "of public land you were one of the", "49:02", "people that sat down with him and got", "49:04", "his take on it and ultimately because", "49:06", "the outcry from people who loved the", "49:09", "outdoors", "49:09", "hunters and fishermen that was stopped", "49:11", "yeah very interesting", "49:13", "yeah and Jason he took a lot of shit but", "49:15", "he seems like a very reasonable guy I", "49:17", "think so too", "49:18", "it's um you know he's out of politics", "49:21", "now was he doing it he's on Fox News oh", "49:24", "he's a correspondent yeah yeah he's so", "49:26", "he's completely he's a congressman out", "49:28", "of Utah yeah and I went back to DC and", "49:31", "talked to talk to him that was HR 622", "49:33", "and that was they wanted to sell just", "49:36", "what they determined disposable public", "49:39", "land and I'm like okay wait a second who", "49:42", "says what's disposable because what's", "49:44", "disposable to you might not be to me", "49:46", "maybe it's a great hunting area so I", "49:48", "didn't really like there wasn't really a", "49:51", "way to determine what was disposable", "49:53", "right that's what caught my attention", "49:54", "and other not just mine but even people", "49:56", "like Steve Rinella yeah and a lot of", "49:58", "people in a loop and in the know and I", "50:01", "got advice from let's see Randy nuber", "50:05", "Steve Rinella Joel Webster at the", "50:09", "theater Roosevelt constant conservation", "50:12", "conservation program all those guys are", "50:14", "really experts in the field backcountry", "50:16", "hunters and anglers talk to them I did", "50:19", "those people were super active right", "50:21", "getting people to complain and protest", "50:24", "this and so that one I did get a chance", "50:26", "to go

this elephant", "61:02", "and they need it it's it's really", "61:04", "important protein for them yeah the", "61:06", "solution is very very complicated Africa", "61:11", "is such an enormous place and the", "61:12", "poverty is so intense and the options", "61:15", "are so limited yeah for these people", "61:17", "there is this is not like a simple like", "61:20", "ban the trophy hunting and

for", "61:38", "long time and when he was over there you", "61:40", "got a sense because he's Lois through is", "61:43", "a really fascinating British documentary", "61:46", "guy yeah and you know he he asked", "61:49", "fantastic questions and he's he's really", "61:51", "polite and he like kind of pesters them", "61:53", "over and over and over again until he", "61:54", "gets to the heart of the matter but at", "61:56", "the end of the documentary you realize", "61:58", "like this is complex this is not as", "62:00", "simple as hey these mean people want to", "62:03", "go over there and kill animals and treat", "62:05", "them as objects the whole place is kind", "62:08", "of it's very very confused yeah like", "62:12", "it's a it's a mess", "62:13", "there's a there's a video right now", "62:16", "Jamie could probably find it but so", "62:19", "there's I think there's three hunters", "62:20", "and they're over there I can't remember", "62:21", "if they're they have bows and arrows

like", "62:51", "wait a second", "62:51", "I can kill you then no but in that in", "62:54", "that hesitation time they try to cut off", "62:56", "that leg and get out of there so you", "63:00", "know when you're here in America making", "63:02", "decisions for people like that it's like", "63:04", "I got a problem with that yeah yeah you", "63:09", "well you said makes a lot of sense that", "63:11", "it's a first-world perspective on a", "63:13", "third-world problem where people are", "63:15", "literally starving to death yeah they're", "63:17", "trying to figure out how to get any loot", "63:19", "or survive they need protein that", "63:21", "protein is like gold back there yeah", "63:25", "it's some yeah this is it this is the", "63:28", "video and this is on Discovery

it looks", "63:57", "like these things I know", "63:59", "staring at them yeah and they're super", "64:01", "intense what's that video it's a title", "64:03", "Jamie stealing we're not stealing meat", "64:07", "from wine yeah check it out so I mean", "64:09", "until I I'm obviously not everybody's", "64:13", "can go do this but you need to watch", "64:15", "this just to get an idea of how rough it", "64:18", "is it's just you know the the measures", "64:21", "I'll take to get some protein yeah I", "64:23", "mean that whole Cecil the lion thing", "64:26", "just created this uproar if you

"64:41", "yeah and his family and so to me you", "64:44", "know hunters in are vilified by a large", "64:48", "majority of the population here whereas", "64:49", "we've said before 90s ninety-six percent", "64:52", "of America eats meat and hunters are the", "64:55", "ones out there getting to themselves and", "64:58", "like I remember that last buck I killed", "65:01", "inland I took care I was like meticulous", "65:05", "on taking care of that meat and as I I", "65:07", "gutted the animal as I took the bladder", "65:09", "out I can't help what happened but like", "65:12", "a drop of urine dropped on a tiny little", "65:16", "piece of the back ham and I was just", "65:17", "like what I was not happy and because", "65:21", "that meat is to me it's everything it's", "65:24", "everything for the hunt and I was so", "65:26", "disappointed in myself but I mean", "65:28", "obviously the meats still good but that", "65:30", "I I want to be perfect when I'm when I'm", "65:32",

have to delve", "116:45", "into but as far as stalking and getting", "116:49", "those killed with the bow these axes", "116:51", "deer you're right also like I would", "116:54", "imagine that backpack

the most of me and", "143:28", "then at that same time so that was", "143:31", "2007-2008 then at the same time I was", "143:35", "also ramping up what I did with running", "143:37", "and pushing my body 100 miles and things", "143:40", "like that because you realized that you", "143:42", "needed more endurance I just realized", "143:44", "that once I had I had I've been doing", "143:47", "what I've been telling my kids not to do", "143:49", "I've been coasting you know it still was", "143:52", "more than a lot of people are doing but", "143:54", "to me it felt like I wasn't living up to",

things", "144:07", "it's just it shows me what's possible", "144:09", "and so that's why I know I can have more", "144:12", "to offer that's a fascinating thing that", "144:15", "you know you take these steps towards", "144:17", "this journey and then you realize as", "144:19", "you're making these steps that your", "144:22", "capacity for work is increasing so you", "144:25", "have to push yourself further to test", "144:27", "your body and then you know a marathon", "144:29", "seems out of reach but then the marathon", "144:31", "becomes a normal thing and then a", "144:33", "50-miler", "144:34", "and then 100 miler then 205 mile you", "144:37", "know 238 mile or and now you were", "144:39", "talking the other day with I guess", "144:40", "Candace was considering a 500

know the sound of", "145:21", "something epic like five hundred", "145:24", "non-stop is is so incredible that sounds", "145:29", "so insane that you'd run 238 miles would", "145:32", "be basically halfway done yeah that's", "145:35", "stupid", "145:36", "I know but listen when we were a hundred", "145:38", "miles in yeah 100 miles is a long way", "145:41", "and I told my brother was with me
