walk like in the 1960s how did", "51:16", "they describe like how I guess it was", "51:18", "like coming in at 30,000 feet you know", "51:21", "25 degrees north thing we talked them", "51:24", "down I

burn", "52:06", "and then we we'd come up high so that", "52:08", "we'd coast down in low and come over the", "52:10", "lake and just and then we'd say good", "52:12", "morning she jumped you know how

back of my", "52:23", "stuff Wow would yell at them how", "52:25", "dangerous is it though it seems like", "52:27", "it's pretty dangerous the reason I quit", "52:28", "is because I wasn't paying close enough", "52:30", "attention I almost hit a power line and", "52:33", "it scared me so much I was flying people", "52:36", "for money and stuff you know at the time", "52:37", "oh my god I got wrapped up in the", "52:39", "conversation these guys were having", "52:40", "that's my problem and I'm paying", "52:42", "attention to them more than the flying", "52:44", "and they didn't know we had a close call", "52:46", "I knew we had close call", "52:47", "how close not that close", "52:50", "close enough I I was coming down and I", "52:53", "didn't burn soon enough and so it takes", "52:55", "a while to get your momentum back up and", "52:57", "you know I cleared it by fifty feet but", "53:01", "you know I should have cleared it by", "53:02", "five hundred feet or something now it's", "53:04", "coming in for a landing I guess anyhow", "53:05", "it's scared the hell out of me and I", "53:07", "said you know that's it how many people", "53:08", "had died hitting power lines", "53:10", "oh that's mainly that was happen to", "53:12", "people in balloons not not all that many", "53:15", "compared to the number of people flying", "53:16", "you know it's safer than regular", "53:18", "aircraft no are you harnessed in when", "53:20", "you're up there", "53:20", "oh no oh Jesus I used to sit on the edge", "53:23", "of the basket you know and burn and", "53:25", "really oh yeah man what if a crazy rebel", "53:28", "wind came along and knocked you off well", "53:31", "you wouldn't have launched if it's over", "53:33", "ten miles an hour you wouldn't launch", "53:35", "looks so spooky we'd go rolling my toes", "53:38", "just sitting there looking at that video", "53:40", "we'd go to these air shows where they", "53:41", "bring in you know biplanes and stuff", "53:43", "like that and for the balloons they", "53:45", "would put up a pole in the middle of the", "53:48", "airfield with a keys to a Cadillac or", "53:50", "something on it and you had to go five", "53:52", "miles away anywhere in the radius of", "53:54", "five miles away and launch and whoever", "53:55", "could grab the keys got the balloon well", "53:58", "what if they collide into each other oh", "53:59", "oh you kind of bounce off but if you're", "54:02", "at the same altitude at least but you", "54:04", "rules the road so you're not supposed to", "54:06", "do that but nobody in the things I ever", "54:09", "fluent ever got the keys but you have a", "54:11", "bean bag too so you'd throw that whoever", "54:13", "got closest would win money or something", "54:14", "like that but wow it's great fun you", "54:16", "know that my ex-wife took me on a", "54:18", "balloon ride for my 40th birthday and on", "54:21", "the way back I said well how much do", "54:23", "these things cost how'd he get started", "54:24", "and the next morning I was taking", "54:26", "lessons yeah I had a lot of money then", "54:27", "how much does it cost to get a balloon", "54:29", "balloons about thirty five thousand it", "54:31", "wasn't when I bought it yeah and how do", "54:33", "you fold that bitch up once you're done", "54:35", "flying well they pack into a basket", "54:37", "that's uh no maybe a third of the size", "54:40", "of this table why and but then you have", "54:43", "your basket too so you have a trailer", "54:45", "and do you have a parachute up there", "54:47", "anything shit it's a fail no nothing nah", "54:50", "dude I had balls I had one guy wanted to", "54:53", "pay me to take him up in a parachute but", "54:54", "and he want to jump out but I didn't", "54:56", "want to do it cuz once once the guy", "54:57", "jumps out you get so much lighter and if", "54:59", "you're not care if you shoot up too fast", "55:01", "you collapse the", "55:02", "but that doesn't happen very often but", "55:04", "they're really safe they're really saved", "55:06", "a lot of fun and wow that sounds scary", "55:10", "how do you lower yourself do you have to", "55:12", "lower it naturally that the there's a", "55:14", "hole in the top", "55:15", "uh-huh and you have a line that goes", "55:16", "through it and a rope pull it in bleed", "55:19", "air out of the top and let it go and", "55:21", "then when you're you're actually landing", "55:22", "the top is held in by velcro and so", "55:25", "except for the little flap that's open", "55:27", "when you're just ready to land you rip", "55:29", "that it called pull the top out you pull", "55:31", "the top out and then it'll deflate and", "55:32", "land down sometimes your landings are a", "55:35", "little rough you know I've had landings", "55:36", "are dragged for fifty or hundred yards", "55:38", "or a bounce stuff no you know that that", "55:41", "conditions sometimes make it tough and", "55:43", "in in North Texas at the time you had to", "55:46", "be really you know you can you're", "55:48", "allowed to land anywhere when you're", "55:49", "landing you know the FAA lets you", "55:51", "because you if you if you out of fuel", "55:53", "yeah and there was this one farm up in", "55:56", "North Texas up by Cisco I think it was", "55:58", "and and whenever the balloons would come", "56:01", "in landing you can see dust coming on", "56:02", "these gravel roads from two directions", "56:04", "one would be this farmer with his pickup", "56:06", "and his shotgun and the other be the", "56:07", "sheriff to come to protect you because", "56:09", "the farmer hated you landing on their", "56:10", "lawn you know when ballooning started in", "56:13", "France they they would carry a bottle of", "56:16", "champagne to give to the farmer when", "56:17", "they landed hey thank you for letting us", "56:19", "land here here's the champagne when boom", "56:21", "he started in the United States the", "56:24", "balloonist never gave it to the", "56:25", "landowners he drank it themselves you", "56:27", "know champagne and propane breakfast the", "56:29", "balloonist how rude that's why they", "56:32", "ruined the whole thing", "56:33", "look at this looks like Albuquerque yeah", "56:35", "there's one in Colorado two in Colorado", "56:36", "Springs we went to yeah the woman that", "56:38", "taught me the balloon moved to Colorado", "56:40", "Springs - yeah we went there to see it", "56:42", "but there was bad weather so they never", "56:44", "launched yeah it say you got to do it", "56:46", "you know at sunrise and sunset you know", "56:48", "a couple hours until after sunrise and a", "56:52", "couple hours for sunset that's the only", "56:53", "time the air is stable enough have you", "56:55", "ever met anybody that was up in a", "56:57", "balloon saw UFO no no I mean it's too", "57:00", "early in the day plus you're looking at", "57:02", "other things now convene what what most", "57:04", "people like to do on their first balloon", "57:05", "ride is pick leaves from the top of a", "57:08", "tree Wow", "57:08", "for some reason that's a big thrill you", "57:10", "know so we go and skim the trees and", "57:12", "they can pick leaves wow that's", "57:15", "great fun it's weird that we figured out", "57:17", "how to float float around in the sky", "57:20", "yeah you know it's just a matter of time", "57:22", "before we figure out how to do it with", "57:23", "suits well you know that some jetpacks", "57:26", "are coming around pretty good yeah well", "57:28", "they've got guys that have those", "57:29", "wingsuits that jump off cliffs", "57:33", "I can I can hardly watch those videos so", "57:37", "hard for me to watch oh there's one word", "57:39", "guy crashes it's really hard to watch", "57:41", "that one I haven't seen but it's just a", "57:43", "matter of time before we figure out", "57:44", "something with a like a wing yeah but", "57:47", "those that technology's gonna grow I", "57:50", "think everything's gonna grow you know I", "57:52", "mean if they have a jetpack now and they", "57:54", "do I watched one when I was in Denver", "57:56", "there was my friend Willie has a klg but", "58:00", "isn't klpga klpga", "58:02", "the radio station had a guy come in that", "58:05", "say that had a jetpack guy come in and", "58:08", "he launched a jetpack in the parking lot", "58:10", "and flew through the air for like 10", "58:11", "seconds you know he did it for like 10", "58:13", "seconds and it was like within you know", "58:15", "X amount of years we're gonna be able to", "58:17", "do five minutes and then you know X", "58:19", "amount of years after that they think", "58:20", "they're gonna figure out some sort of", "58:21", "power source and be able to make it a", "58:24", "viable mode of transportation but it was", "58:26", "very complicated as far as like the", "58:29", "control it's gotta be in the yaw and", "58:31", "what is it called there's like two pitch", "58:33", "pitch and yaw yeah apparently it's like", "58:35", "it's not a simple thing to figure we", "58:38", "didn't have to learn that to get a", "58:39", "license for balloons because you know", "58:41", "just up and down and he had what do they", "58:42", "have to learn weather clouds you had", "58:45", "we're learning about procedures with the", "58:47", "FAA because you have to call the FAA in", "58:48", "the morning to the weather report and", "58:50", "all and you tell them where you're gonna", "58:51", "launch and so they know some balloons", "58:53", "are gonna be in the area how much", "58:54", "different is that than a blimp can you", "58:56", "can you target a blimp I've never been", "58:57", "in a blimp buddy pilot one with your", "58:59", "license oh no no it's lighter than air", "59:01", "well hmm maybe I don't know anybody", "59:04", "crazy enough to let me do it but I guess", "59:06", "I guess that would be legal it's a", "59:08", "lighter than aircraft yeah do you have", "59:10", "to renew that license or is that once", "59:11", "you get it you got it that's that's the", "59:13", "crazy thing you you don't ever have to", "59:16", "renew it but you have to have a check", "59:18", "flight every year I think with somebody", "59:20", "else who's a commercial pilot so all you", "59:23", "have to do is get a friend go up take a", "59:24", "ride with you in your current again I'm", "59:26", "not current what was that one you just", "59:28", "put up", "59:28", "lady gaga and a dress that flies Lady", "59:31", "Gaga the actual Lady Gaga yeah there's a", "59:33", "guy it's like remote-controlled and oso", "59:36", "is it Lady Gaga or is it a toy it's Lady", "59:38", "Gaga I guess", "59:39", "so Lady Gaga is in a jet pack ok here", "59:41", "she is she's got a helmet on let me see", "59:45", "this show us after it's over", "59:48", "so she climbs into this fucking thing", "59:51", "and flies around", "59:51", "I didn't think jetpacks could be", "59:57", "annoying", "59:59", "there's Lady Gaga a jetpack humans we", "60:03", "ruin everything", "60:03", "this is so stupid she's connected by", "60:05", "wires shut this off this is a fucking", "60:07", "charade", "60:08", "there's nothing really a jetpack she's", "60:10", "all wired up and everything like that", "60:11", "it's more like a little helicopter yeah", "60:13", "that's for shit that's today's it's", "60:14", "wired but you know there's been guys", "60:16", "going to the stadium football stadiums", "60:18", "in those jet packs yeah well there's", "60:19", "that one guy that landed he was in the", "60:21", "middle of a boxing match Evander", "60:23", "Holyfield was fighting Riddick Bowe and", "60:24", "the guy landed he had like a parachute", "60:27", "connected to fans and he called himself", "60:29", "like the fan I know what you remember", "60:31", "that and they landed and it delayed the", "60:34", "fight for like a half an hour why they", "60:35", "had to arrest this guy bringing police", "60:37", "and they beat the guy up and everything", "60:39", "like that and then it sort of changed", "60:40", "the the atmosphere of the fight because", "60:42", "there was a big break and right all the", "60:44", "fight nobody cool off and then had to go", "60:46", "at it again but that was like so on as I", "60:49", "used to walk in the bluffs down by Del", "60:51", "Mar which her you know up maybe 30 feet", "60:53", "or something and one day a guy came by", "60:55", "and one of those he's a parachute had a", "60:56", "big fan on the back and and he was hit I", "60:58", "level with me and he said you know hello", "61:00", "hello and he's moving very slowly yeah", "61:04", "this is the video Riddick Bowe and", "61:05", "Evander Holyfield fight and look they", "61:07", "stop and they're like what the hell and", "61:10", "they're looking at is boom the guy lands", "61:12", "ringside in the crowd they should have", "61:15", "turned Holyfield on it to him let him", "61:17", "well they're in the middle right they", "61:18", "has a big more important things to do", "61:21", "they just beat the shit out of this guy", "61:22", "though I can see why I think that guy's", "61:24", "probably still in jail I'm surprised", "61:26", "they didn't just reschedule the fight", "61:27", "that's not really fair to do that it", "61:29", "well I think people wanted a conclusion", "61:31", "yeah it was all going on and all the", "61:32", "money there yeah and all the money on", "61:34",

"61:43", "five-minute break cut the cords just", "61:45", "let's do this", "61:45", "but as I think was quite a quite a break", "61:48", "while they arrested this dummy the needy", "61:51", "bitch", "61:52", "that's it there's an example of a needy", "61:54", "bitch that's they should have those", "61:55", "fights indoors yeah I think they", "61:57", "probably mostly do yeah", "61:59", "very rarely hear about fights outdoor I", "62:01", "know they do a few occasionally outside", "62:03", "in Vegas yeah there's a big one waiting", "62:06", "back in hordes in Africa or something I",
