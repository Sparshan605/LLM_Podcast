I we don't know how his brain", "47:09", "even works so who knows the fuck", "47:11", "happened I hope he didn't do something", "47:14", "but then again that means that one of", "47:17", "two things happened either he took a st.", "47:18", "attainted supplement which is after a", "47:20", "while almost comes becomes a joke like", "47:23", "to keep people keep saying that he", "47:24", "stopped taking supplements or even worse", "47:26", "if someone spiked him yeah the spiking", "47:28", "thing because it seemed like I that", "47:31", "would be crazy", "47:32", "yeah that would be crazy you could do", "47:35", "that to somebody though for sure I mean", "47:37", "if somebody is around someone with", "47:40", "nefarious intentions or someone's around", "47:43", "someone who's resentful and

that", "47:59", "happened right there it was after the", "48:01", "way and yes it's a urine wasn't tested", "48:04", "at anytime before that I'm sure he was", "48:08", "there they were tested multiple times in", "48:10", "camp probably not necessarily just", "48:13", "because it's really like well if you", "48:16", "know I don't know like what kind of time", "48:18", "period they tested them in and I don't", "48:20", "know what kind of half-life this stuff", "48:22", "has because apparently Chael Sonnen was", "48:25", "telling Brendan Schaub that it gets out", "48:28", "of your system quite

it", "65:22", "I think this guy I think it's all dumb", "65:24", "people I think it's low watt brains that", "65:26", "just fake they're easy to trick into", "65:28", "believe into anything I mean

doing like are", "65:39", "they willfully giving in to this because", "65:42", "they want the guy to like him and like", "65:44", "he comes up to you like are they really", "65:48", "feeling it I mean are they convincing", "65:50", "them is it a placebo effect", "65:51", "are they convincing themselves I think", "65:54", "so", "65:55", "you think so yeah I think I think like", "65:58", "dumb people can really do a lot that we", "65:59", "can see we're saying if you really", "66:03", "believe that there is you know make up", "66:07", "but it doesn't even have to be Jesus or", "66:09", "our gods I

still", "68:01", "like they did like like the knuckle", "68:03", "thing back then though maybe having", "68:05", "arrives for sure I still like a high", "68:07", "five I think high five is silly it's fun", "68:10", "I like high five I always miss people's", "68:12", "high fives and I feel like an idiot like", "68:14", "I'm always like high five to me he's", "68:17", "like fun like high five is fun like a", "68:20", "handshake you could just be just cordial", "68:23", "and friendly but this has got some fun", "68:25", "to it time you did a low five what's", "68:27", "that man I can't remember cuz you got to", "68:29", "get a low five back it's problem with", "68:30", "low five high five is egalitarian", "68:33", "everyone's equal it's just high five low", "68:36", "five we have to decide well who's", "68:38", "hitting who you hit me am i hitting you", "68:40", "you gonna hit me first and then I'm", "68:41", "gonna hit you back how's this work okay", "68:43", "you go first ready go flap flap nobody", "68:46", "does that anymore slap yeah I haven't", "68:48", "done that No so because people figured", "68:51", "out we don't have to do this we can just", "68:52", "do this it's better what's up", "68:55", "like I feel happy when I give people", "68:57", "high-fives I'm a knuckle guy man just", "68:59", "too much too much crank guy too much", "69:01", "steam yeah you gotta wash your phone man", "69:04", "I was reading this thing about cell", "69:05", "phones they were saying they're dirtier", "69:06", "than half the toilets of the world oh", "69:07", "yeah because you

wonder when they can", "149:45", "measure though like when they knew they", "149:46", "knew when they were cold like fuck it's", "149:48", "cold out one day when they knew what", "149:50", "that meant though look if there was a", "149:51", "number I guess we needed tools also to", "149:53", "track that's wrapped right now see in a", "149:55", "year it makes way more sense what I just", "149:57",

probably more more recent than we", "150:16", "think occasion of work here on the", "150:19", "Fahrenheit scale", "150:20", "17:24 but the first recorded temperature", "150:23", "it says here was 1880 Oh 1880s Wow 1870", "150:28", "a it was two years off that's amazing", "150:31", "she probably had to have something touch", "150:32", "it back then touch the mercury oh yeah", "150:34", "how they figured out what I mean look we", "150:36", "can't even agree on the metric system", "150:38", "versus inches what's interesting there", "150:40", "then if that was the first time they", "150:41",

they", "151:05", "have any idea like did they even", "151:06", "describe it in measurement and they the", "151:09", "clinical thermometer wasn't invented", "151:11", "until 1880 1866 it was probably some", "151:16", "dude with a regular mom he just stuck it", "151:17", "up his ass somebody caught him and he", "151:19", "was like oh brother she's making sure", "151:20", "that this thing works on people took", "151:22", "five minutes instead of 20 because it", "151:24", "was up his ass he did it up", "151:27", "that's a 99 they started in 1999 is when", "151:32", "the forehead thermometer came out and", "151:34", "that 1999 yeah Jesus Christ", "151:37", "I like this first temporal artery", "151:39", "thermometer 1999 that's the one you put", "151:42", "on your forehead right nuts",

hot", "151:54", "like did they when did they invent units", "151:58", "of measurement for temperature when was", "152:01", "that invented cuz obviously there's more", "152:04", "than one right there's Celsius and", "152:07", "there's Fahrenheit the Celsius is the", "152:09", "one that's based on the metric system", "152:10", "that's used by almost everybody except", "152:12", "for us we're fucking assholes you know", "152:17", "they'll say something like a host 35", "152:19", "degrees out like what are you talking", "152:20", "about it's not hot and you know your", "152:22", "Celsius is what is that like 80 and 135", "152:26", "degrees is hot as fuck right that'd be", "152:27", "cool if we all had the same like", "152:29", "currency also they just cost more in", "152:32", "different places I would why don't we", "152:33", "just you to make everything easier on", "152:35", "everything because everybody's corrupt", "152:37", "and if we were all together someone", "152:40", "would fuck us up

for a long time but like what", "153:15", "about when was a unit of measurement for", "153:18", "temperature invented doesn't say", "153:25", "temperature well somebody had to like", "153:27", "not have it and then they had it there", "153:31", "must be a date right we probably and it", "153:33", "probably would have started like that", "153:34", "you this is the temperature for a dead", "153:36", "Raven or something like that and this is", "153:38", "a snake in 1659 Wow Wow what the fuck", "153:47", "did they used to measure it if they", "153:48", "didn't have thermometers right I mean", "153:54", "imagine not having a thermometer and", "153:56", "trying to measure the heat it sounds", "153:58", "like your inner dialogue of you at night", "154:00", "at 3:00 in the morning",
