the reason", "00:45", "so i kept getting bronchitis pneumonia", "00:47", "year after year it just kept happening", "00:49", "so", "00:50", "a doctor friend of mine suggested a", "00:52", "breathing class", "00:53", "might help i didn't know much about this", "00:55", "but went down signed up", "00:57", "and was sitting in the corner of this", "01:00", "studio", "01:01", "cold room legs crossed

"01:31", "filed it away", "01:32", "forgot about it for a number of years", "01:34", "until i met some free divers", "01:35", "these are people who have through the", "01:37", "power of will",

possible", "01:47", "so i thought wow there's something in", "01:49", "breathing here that", "01:50", "i don't know about and i figured other", "01:52", "people might not know about", "01:54", "as well uh that's that's that's really", "01:56", "interesting", "01:57", "you know i've known a bunch of free", "01:59", "divers and uh", "02:01", "i've known a bunch of jiu jitsu people", "02:03",

jitsu", "02:49", "just stressed constantly that it's all", "02:52", "about the breath", "02:53", "and that breathing is it's everything", "02:56", "and it's everything for jiu jitsu it's", "02:59",

that has been forgotten", "03:08", "i know that coaches in the 50s used to", "03:10", "have their runners", "03:11", "take a big mouthful of water run around", "03:14", "the track and then they'd have to spit", "03:15", "out that same amount of water into a cup", "03:17", "to force them to breathe through their", "03:19", "nose", "03:19", "to force them to move their diaphragms", "03:21", "up and down a little more", "03:23", "because breathing is so essential to the", "03:25", "recovery their endurance and their", "03:26", "performance", "03:27", "yeah one of the things i found", "03:28", "interesting about your book was the", "03:29", "experiment with plugging up the nose", "03:32", "for pro what did you guys do it for a", "03:33", "month is that what it was 10 days", "03:35", "10 days and that that 10 i", "03:38", "my nose was broken most of my life i had", "03:41", "a useless nose till i was 40", "03:43", "and then i got an operation to have my", "03:44", "deviated septum corrected and the", "03:46", "turbinates shaved down and", "03:48", "then it changed my life it really did", "03:50", "like i didn't realize", "03:52", "like what like the term mouth breather", "03:55", "is a really interesting term right", "03:56", "because it's term for a moron", "03:57", "but i i felt like a moron um", "04:01", "like after i got my nose fixed i was", "04:02", "like why didn't i do this before like i", "04:04", "was robbing myself of", "04:06", "oxygen yeah and there's so much science", "04:09", "supporting", "04:09", "how injurious it is to constantly be", "04:12",

snoring sleep apnea even", "04:28", "metabolic", "04:29", "disorders i mean it goes on and on and", "04:31", "on so i had been talking to the chief of", "04:34", "rhinology research at stanford", "04:36", "we've done many interviews over a series", "04:38", "of months", "04:39", "he's a big nose guy so he said this is", "04:41", "the most amazing organ", "04:42", "no one's talking about it at the nih", "04:45", "there's no school", "04:46", "for studying the nose and its effects", "04:48", "and he thought that that was criminal", "04:50", "so he had warned me how bad mouth", "04:52", "breathing was", "04:53", "but no one knew how quickly that damage", "04:55", "came on so", "04:57", "we knew that after years it can change", "04:59", "the structure of your face", "05:00", "it's so common in kids that it has a", "05:02", "term called adenoid face if you", "05:04", "see these kids with very long faces", "05:06", "because they've been mouth breathing so", "05:07", "long that their faces have", "05:08", "actually that the musculature and the", "05:10", "skeleton has have changed it changes", "05:12", "your skeleton", "05:13", "yeah yeah it it it makes it creates a", "05:15", "longer face", "05:17", "so and that that also makes these people", "05:19", "much more apt to snoring and sleep apnea", "05:21", "so but but no one knew if if a month of", "05:24", "mouth breathing would be bad", "05:25", "a year like how soon those those issues", "05:28", "came on so", "05:29", "i asked him i said well why don't you", "05:31", "test it you're one of the", "05:32", "best universities in the world you have", "05:35", "the means to do this", "05:36", "and he thought in his words it would be", "05:38", "unethical", "05:39", "because he knew how damaging that it", "05:42", "could be for people", "05:43", "and so i volunteered i said why don't", "05:45", "you test it on me i'll get somebody else", "05:47", "to do it", "05:48", "uh they had no money for this so we had", "05:50", "to pay for this study", "05:52", "just to experience what what that was", "05:54", "like and the point wasn't due", "05:56", "to do some like jackass stunt it was to", "05:59", "lull ourselves into a position my body", "06:01", "certainly knew i think i was mouth", "06:02", "breathing through much of my youth", "06:04", "and that 25 to 50 of the population", "06:07", "knows and and to actually measure what", "06:09", "happens", "06:09", "now do you think there was some", "06:11", "bacterial growth that was inside your", "06:12", "nose as well from this do you think that", "06:14", "some of that could be attributed to just", "06:16", "the i the act of plugging the nose", "06:18", "because you physically plugged it it's", "06:19", "not like you chose to breathe out of", "06:21", "your mouth", "06:22", "you actually like see you you closed up", "06:24", "the opening", "06:25", "yeah that's that's right and it could no", "06:28", "one knows for sure", "06:29", "because the less you use your nose the", "06:30", "less you're going to be able to use your", "06:32", "nose just like any other muscle so", "06:34", "when people start habitually breathing", "06:36", "through their mouths their noses are", "06:38", "going to start to close up and we know", "06:39", "this from the doctor of speech language", "06:41", "pathology at stanford", "06:43", "she measured people who had laryngectomy", "06:46", "holes drilled in their throats so they", "06:47", "could breathe", "06:48", "she found between two months and two", "06:50", "years their noses were completely", "06:52", "blocked", "06:52", "zero air coming in so the more you use", "06:55", "it the more you're going to be able to", "06:57", "use it so the less you use it the more", "06:59", "apt you will you will be to have", "07:01", "problems what is the process well why", "07:03", "does the nose close", "07:04", "up it would seem that it's a hole like", "07:06", "why would that hole close", "07:07", "it's not in use those turbinates all", "07:09", "those tissues just just start closing up", "07:13", "and so using your nose actually makes", "07:15", "the opening wider", "07:16", "absolutely really yeah absolutely my", "07:18", "nose got physically wider", "07:20", "after my operation it's really strange", "07:22", "like i was", "07:23", "i look back on the photos from when i", "07:26", "was", "07:27", "40 on my actual physical and i", "07:30", "attributed it to the fact that they put", "07:32", "these big", "07:32", "foam things and these plastic spacers in", "07:35", "there", "07:36", "because the doctor that had did the", "07:37", "operation he's", "07:39", "for i forget the period of time", "07:42", "afterwards i had to have", "07:43", "these things stuffed into my nose and", "07:45", "this plastic", "07:46", "that was sort of sutured in place to", "07:48", "hold it into position", "07:50", "and i i attributed that to why my nose", "07:53", "got wider", "07:53", "but i noticed it like within the year or", "07:57", "two afterwards like", "07:58", "my fucking nose is wider like it's", "08:00", "different like if i look at older", "08:01", "pictures of myself my nose was more", "08:03", "narrow and now it's more flared out and", "08:04", "i", "08:05", "i felt like it was because of that but", "08:07", "now that you're saying this", "08:09", "now i'm thinking maybe it's just from", "08:11", "breathing out of it well surgical", "08:13", "interventions are gonna", "08:14", "open that airway there's no doubt about", "08:16", "that but but we know the more that you", "08:18", "breathe through your nose the more that", "08:19", "it's gonna open up and you can see this", "08:20", "with people who are habitual mouth", "08:22", "breathers", "08:23", "who are also joggers who have just been", "08:24", "breathing through their mouths for for", "08:26", "decades", "08:27", "they start breathing through their nose", "08:28", "at the beginning it's really really hard", "08:30", "yeah i can't do this this is awful then", "08:33", "weeks go by", "08:34", "months go by and their noses open up", "08:37", "and and allows them to to breathe", "08:38", "through the nose and the benefits of", "08:40", "that they're", "08:40", "innumerable so many benefits of nasal", "08:43", "breathing not only oxygen but it helps", "08:44", "defend your body", "08:45", "humidifies air conditions air on and on", "08:48", "and on", "08:48", "and this is something i just don't think", "08:50", "a lot of people realize", "08:52", "and and from the researchers i'd been", "08:53", "talking to they were a bit frustrated", "08:55", "too", "08:56", "seeing so many chronic conditions tied", "08:58", "to mouth breathing", "09:00", "and how so many of those could either be", "09:03", "improved upon or sometimes outright", "09:05", "cured by by switching the pathway", "09:07", "in which you breathe so does breathing", "09:09", "through your nose make your actual", "09:10", "nostril opening wider i don't know that", "09:13", "i i i and and uh i haven't seen any", "09:16", "papers on that", "09:17", "so it's but my nostril holes and", "09:20", "everything is probably just from the", "09:21", "surgical intervention and stuffing it", "09:22", "with plastic and stretching it out", "09:24", "i would assume so yeah yeah now what", "09:28", "wim hof will you reference in the book", "09:29", "he doesn't give a fuck about mouth about", "09:31", "nose breathing or mouth breathing he", "09:32", "just goes just breathe motherfucker", "09:35", "breathe well that's what he says oh yeah", "09:37", "i practiced", "09:38", "his his motive breathing all the time", "09:40", "i'm used to having you know his", "09:42", "his little voice in my head why doesn't", "09:44", "he care about", "09:45", "breathing out from the nose of the mouth", "09:47", "he just wants you to breathe because if", "09:48", "we're breathing 25 000 times a day", "09:50", "if you're taking 500 of those breaths", "09:52", "through your mouth it's not going to", "09:53", "really make any impact on you", "09:55", "i'm talking about habitual mouth", "09:57", "breathing no i understand i'm just", "09:58", "talking about through breathing", "09:59", "exercises he's", "10:00", "he's so what he's done is he wants to", "10:02", "make this easy and accessible for people", "10:04", "so many people can't breathe through", "10:06", "their noses so they go", "10:08", "they can't get that breath in those 30", "10:10", "huge breaths you need to take right", "10:12", "they take too long to do it so he says", "10:14", "it doesn't matter", "10:15", "don't pay attention you need to get that", "10:18", "breath in you need to expand your lungs", "10:20", "and for the rest of the time you know i", "10:22", "the the benefits of nasal breathing that", "10:24", "habitual breathing", "10:26", "is is so important to health it seems so", "10:28", "strange to me reading your book", "10:30", "that i'm just learning this in terms of", "10:33", "like", "10:34", "i mean i've been doing athletics my", "10:36", "whole life", "10:37", "how do i not know that breathing through", "10:40", "the nose is more beneficial how do", "10:42", "coaches not know this this is something", "10:44", "i just got running up against over and", "10:46", "over again", "10:46", "and when i first started writing this", "10:48", "book my friends who were journalists and", "10:50", "authors they said you're writing a book", "10:51", "about breathing", "10:52", "why would you write a book about", "10:53", "breeding walking yeah yeah", "10:55", "well there's there's a good new book", "10:57", "about walking it's all right", "10:58", "really um so so they were ripping on me", "11:02", "quite quite a bit", "11:03", "until they heard some of the details of", "11:04", "it um and the stuff is like", "11:06", "has been right in front of us the whole", "11:08", "time and it's so", "11:09", "obvious that no one's really paying", "11:11", "attention to it", "11:12", "and the scientific foundation all the", "11:15", "research is there", "11:16", "and that's what makes these these", "11:18", "researchers these scientists", "11:19", "so frustrated is they we have 50 years", "11:22", "of rock solid science here", "11:24", "showing the problems with mouth", "11:25", "breathing showing the problems with", "11:26", "snoring and sleep apnea", "11:28", "no one's really been paying attention", "11:29", "we're treating all these separate", "11:31", "problems that are associated with these", "11:34", "core issues and we're not looking at the", "11:35", "core issue", "11:36", "and i think that breathing has to be", "11:38", "considered along with diet", "11:40", "and exercise as a pillar of health", "11:43", "because even if you eat", "11:44", "keto vegan paleo whatever even if you", "11:47", "exercise all the time if you're not", "11:48", "breathing right you're never really", "11:49", "going to be healthy", "11:50", "we know that to be the truth so air", "11:52", "comes through your mouth", "11:54", "air comes through your nose what is the", "11:55", "difference between the air coming", "11:57", "through your nose", "11:57", "okay so your nose if you were to take", "12:00", "your fist", "12:01", "you've got a really big fist so someone", "12:03", "with a slightly smaller fist", "12:05", "and to take that fist and imagine just", "12:07", "pushing it inside of your head that's", "12:09", "about the volume of your nose and all", "12:11", "the sinus cavities", "12:12", "so they even stretch up above your eyes", "12:15", "so the volume of your", "12:16", "fist that's crazy it's about a billiard", "12:18", "ball um so", "12:19", "so a little it depends on what size fish", "12:21", "you have right", "12:22", "so so all and and they call it the nasal", "12:26", "concha", "12:27", "because it looks exactly like a seashell", "12:29", "if you were to split a seashell", "12:31", "in in half and look at it that's what's", "12:34", "happening in your nose", "12:35", "and all of this stuff evolved this way", "12:37", "for a reason", "12:39", "so that air that comes in through the", "12:40", "nose is slowed down", "12:42", "it's filtered it's humidified and it's", "12:45", "conditioned", "12:46", "so by the time it gets to your lungs", "12:49", "your lungs can absorb that oxygen so", "12:51", "much", "12:52", "easier and the the nose is really the", "12:54", "first line of defense", "12:55", "another amazing thing with the nose is", "12:58", "it produces something called", "12:59", "nitric oxide which is this wonderful", "13:02", "molecule that is a vasodilator that", "13:04", "plays an essential role in oxygen", "13:06", "delivery", "13:07", "and also helps battle off viruses", "13:10", "bacteria and other pathogens", "13:12", "so this is all happening in the nose and", "13:15", "slowing down that air and all of these", "13:17", "other functions", "13:18", "allow us to gain about 20 more oxygen", "13:21", "breathing through the nose", "13:22", "than breathing through the mouth so you", "13:24", "can breathe less", "13:26", "and get more by breathing through the", "13:27", "nose wow", "13:29", "um so breathing through the mouth even", "13:31", "though though you're filling your lungs", "13:33", "up", "13:34", "even though you're you're taking a big", "13:36", "deep breath you're filling your lungs up", "13:38", "you're not getting as much oxygen", "13:39", "that's right because you can over", "13:41", "breathe when people", "13:43", "at a gym or when people are jogging you", "13:45", "see them", "13:46", "i'm really going to get the maximum", "13:48", "amount of oxygen in that's not what hap", "13:51", "what is happening to your body so you", "13:53", "are offloading", "13:54", "the co2 by offloading too much co2", "13:57", "you're causing constriction", "13:59", "in your circulation so right now if we", "14:01", "were to breathe", "14:02", "30 huge breaths you'll feel some", "14:04", "tingling in your head", "14:06", "you'll feel some maybe your fingertips", "14:08", "will get cool your toes will get too", "14:10", "cool that's not from an increase of", "14:12", "oxygen it's the opposite that's", "14:13", "happening that's from a decrease of", "14:15", "circulation", "14:16", "so your body wants to be in balance you", "14:18", "want to have the right amount of co2", "14:20", "and oxygen for optimum delivery and", "14:22", "that's what the nose helps you to do",

it's very", "16:42", "appealing to me and very interesting to", "16:43", "me because", "16:45", "even though breathing has been around", "16:47", "for a long time", "16:48", "you know everybody knows

man but", "18:47", "i've i believe there's something to it", "18:49", "because my own personal benefits that", "18:51", "i've gotten from breathing exercises", "18:53", "is one of the reasons why

then", "20:22", "long exhales through my nose when i'm", "20:24", "doing that", "20:25", "it it makes everything easier it's weird", "20:28", "it's it's a", "20:29", "it's it like it makes your body", "20:32", "for whatever reason more accepting", "20:36", "of the extreme heat well that's what i", "20:38", "love about breathing", "20:39", "is it allows us these levers in the", "20:42", "systems that we can't otherwise control", "20:44", "so the autonomic nervous system is", "20:46", "supposed to be beyond our control it's", "20:48", "called autonomic", "20:49", "automatic can't control it we can", "20:52", "through through breathing you you may", "20:53", "not be able to control your", "20:55", "liver function or your stomach or your", "20:57", "heart", "20:58", "but when you breathe a certain way you", "21:00", "can influence all those functions", "21:02", "and you can start taking control of", "21:04", "these other elements of your body as wim", "21:05", "is showing", "21:06",

you test me", "21:16", "instead of just", "21:17", "just talking we have measurements we", "21:20", "have", "21:20", "equipment to test the stuff if we can", "21:22", "measure it we can study it if we can", "21:24", "study it we can prove if it's right or", "21:25", "wrong", "21:26", "and that's what i find is is so", "21:28", "interesting and accessible about", "21:29", "breathing", "21:30", "as well even if someone has a pulse ox", "21:33", "or you have a heart rate variability", "21:34", "monitor", "21:35", "you can breathe in certain ways and", "21:37", "instantly see what it does to your body", "21:39", "so people who say that this is a placebo", "21:42", "effect don't understand that this is a", "21:44", "biological function that you're taking", "21:45", "control of", "21:46", "and if you can elicit such a strong", "21:48", "response in a couple of minutes", "21:50", "imagine what you can do in a couple of", "21:52", "days or a couple of weeks or a couple of", "21:54", "months",

conditions", "22:04", "yeah whim is a really interesting sort", "22:06", "of", "22:07", "uh he's", "22:10", "he's a great spokesperson for it because", "22:12", "he drinks heineken and eats spaghetti", "22:14", "like he's a weirdo you know what i mean", "22:16", "and he swears a lot and he's fun", "22:18", "and he's he's silly what i like about", "22:22", "him", "22:22", "is the fact that he he doesn't seem like", "22:25", "this", "22:26", "mystical person that you'll you can't", "22:29", "relate to", "22:30", "he's very relatable yeah and i think", "22:32", "that that's where breathing really needs", "22:34", "to move from this this new ageiness", "22:36", "in into more pragmatic and practical", "22:38", "area and he is wim is like the everyman", "22:41", "right and he's he's gone and discovered", "22:44", "these things and now he's showing people", "22:45", "how to use them and", "22:46", "he's very clear that he did not invent", "22:49", "these methods", "22:50", "these methods have been around for at", "22:52", "least a thousand years especially", "22:54", "tumo and there's documentation that goes", "22:56", "back", "22:57", "1000 years 1200 years of people doing", "23:00", "this", "23:01", "to heat themselves up they're like i", "23:02", "don't have a jacket", "23:04", "i don't have anything else to wear i'm", "23:06", "freezing how do i keep my core", "23:08", "temperature warm", "23:09", "in these freezing temperatures can you", "23:11", "explain two mode of people yeah sure so", "23:13", "so tumo is a breathing practice", "23:15", "that is used to build heat in the body", "23:18", "build inner heat", "23:19", "and it was the first documentation was", "23:22", "from this guy naropa", "23:24", "who about 11 1100 years ago", "23:27", "went off on a spare spiritual pilgrimage", "23:30", "ended up in the himalayas needed to heat", "23:31", "himself and use this practice and it", "23:34", "stayed in the monasteries for", "23:36", "for hundreds of years until this belgian", "23:39", "french opera singer anarchist around the", "23:42", "1900s a mouthful", "23:44", "yeah yeah i was going to include a few", "23:46", "more because she did a whole bunch of", "23:48", "she's into free love feminism i'm i mean", "23:50", "you you name it she she ran the gamut so", "23:53", "um but she went on a spiritual", "23:55", "pilgrimage for 14 years in the himalayas", "23:57", "when she was in her 40s this is in the", "23:59", "1900s which was just like", "24:01", "unheard of at the time and she", "24:02", "discovered this this thing", "24:04", "she said she was able to use this to not", "24:07", "eat or drink anything", "24:09", "at elevations of above 8 000 18 000", "24:13", "feet and walk for about 19 hours at a", "24:16", "time there are no fact checkers there to", "24:17", "prove it", "24:18", "and nobody believed her until herbert", "24:20", "benson at harvard had heard enough of", "24:22", "these stories", "24:23", "in the 1980s that he went out and tested", "24:26", "these monks and found out that they", "24:28", "could do", "24:28", "exactly what they had been told that", "24:31", "they were supposed", "24:32", "to do you know for thousands of years", "24:33", "and what is the technique of tumor", "24:35", "the technique is it's very similar to", "24:38", "wim hof's version of tumo", "24:39", "the monks do it in a slightly different", "24:41", "way they slow down their nervous system", "24:44", "and benson found that they were able to", "24:46", "slow their metabolism by 60", "24:48", "so it's lower than anything that that", "24:50", "has ever been measured before", "24:52", "so they just do that and focus", "24:55", "on a fire within the body and breathe", "24:58", "out sometimes they breathe", "24:59", "a little more you can see videotapes of", "25:01", "this for people who don't believe this", "25:03", "stuff", "25:03", "uh you can see videotapes of this guy in", "25:06", "a cold room", "25:07", "no shirt on sweating they put a wet", "25:10", "sheet on him", "25:10", "and he dries the sheet within about a", "25:12", "half an hour because he's so", "25:14", "hot and he's only doing this through", "25:16", "breathing and when you", "25:17", "you're making this noise like what is", "25:18", "the technique like you're breathing", "25:20", "is this like an 80 20 thing where you", "25:22", "fully feel fill the lungs out and let 80", "25:25", "or let 20 out and then breathe in again", "25:27", "and let 20 percent out like that kind of", "25:29", "that version is much more complicated", "25:31", "the the type that the bond tumor", "25:33", "monks use so wim's method does the exact", "25:37", "same thing but he's stimulating the", "25:38", "nervous system", "25:39", "so his is 30 huge breaths breath hold as", "25:43", "long as you can", "25:44", "one big breath in 15 second hold and", "25:46", "then out", "25:48", "and what are these monks doing they're", "25:50", "doing a slower version of it", "25:52", "so i have not practiced that version of", "25:54", "tumor why not", "25:55", "ah because it's really complicated and", "25:57", "to do it right you need to get", "25:59", "the master there and i tried to contact", "26:01", "these guys and they didn't want", "26:03", "did not want me there reporting on what", "26:05", "they were doing", "26:06", "god i would feel like if they knew the", "26:08", "benefits of this they would want the", "26:10", "world to know", "26:11", "you would think so but what would we do", "26:13", "with it right", "26:14", "we'd find it we can", "26:17", "commercialize it and and so so maybe", "26:20", "they don't want the world to know you", "26:22", "know maybe they want to keep a few", "26:23", "things in their back pocket", "26:24", "so what do you know of what they're", "26:27", "doing", "26:28", "why is it so complicated because so much", "26:31", "of this is a mental practice", "26:32", "it's okay so it's joining just the", "26:34", "breathing there's some sort of a thought", "26:35", "process that goes on", "26:37", "and and to get that visualization and to", "26:39", "be able to focus for that amount of time", "26:42", "takes a lot of time i think one of the", "26:43", "reasons that wim's process", "26:45", "is so easy and accessible you can think", "26:47", "about whatever you want while you're", "26:49", "breathing that way", "26:49", "you think about emails think about what", "26:51", "you're going to have for dinner", "26:53", "and as long as you're breathing that way", "26:54", "it'll do what it does and their method", "26:57", "requires you to think about very", "26:58", "specific things think about a fire", "27:01", "inside of your belly moving your belly", "27:03", "in and out", "27:05", "but you so you know this i don't know", "27:07", "every single step", "27:08", "no i do what other steps could there be", "27:11", "like is there", "27:12", "there's there's fast breathing there's", "27:14", "slow breathing", "27:15", "and there's a ton of mental focus so", "27:18", "there's like 20 steps that that", "27:20", "you have to go through to to really get", "27:22", "this right are we in danger of losing", "27:24", "this", "27:24", "like it seems like you know about it but", "27:28", "you don't know how to do it", "27:29", "i i i don't know i know the elements of", "27:32", "it right", "27:33", "and what i've read online and who knows", "27:35", "how true that stuff is", "27:36", "right there's a few guys teaching this", "27:39", "one's in colorado and the others are in", "27:41", "india is he in boulder he must be older", "27:43", "he has to be", "27:45", "where else so so", "27:49", "but but you think about how many", "27:50", "languages that we're losing right", "27:52", "along with those languages we're losing", "27:54", "knowledge very very quickly", "27:55", "and this is happening every decade and", "27:57", "and so especially if you consider what's", "27:59", "happened to", "28:00", "tibet to these civilizations that have", "28:02", "been there practicing this technology of", "28:04", "breathing for thousands of years", "28:06", "a lot of it's just disappearing yeah", "28:08", "that's a shame", "28:10", "um have you thought about going there", "28:12", "and like", "28:13", "hanging out with those guys and i'd love", "28:14", "to you can't can't do that now", "28:16", "right of course i i i spent some time", "28:19", "you know the book i", "28:20", "talk about tumo and about half of one", "28:22", "chapter and i wanted to to cover it", "28:24", "wim's been written about all over the", "28:26", "place people know his method but i", "28:27", "wanted to look at it", "28:28", "at the science from it and look at the", "28:30", "history of it because because the how", "28:32", "was one story but to me it was more", "28:34", "interesting to find why what's happening", "28:36", "to the body why", "28:37", "why does this happen where does it come", "28:39", "from yeah that's what i focused on", "28:41", "so this gentleman that teaches in", "28:42", "colorado where did he learn it from", "28:44", "he must have learned it from from the", "28:46", "great sages you know in dharmsala or", "28:48", "tibet", "28:49", "or maybe he's like one of those kung fu", "28:50", "guys who just fakes it or or maybe he's", "28:52", "just", "28:53", "yeah just a faker a faker you know yeah", "28:56", "i could just made something up it could", "28:58", "be", "28:58", "i don't want to accuse him but", "29:02", "in the martial arts world that happens a", "29:04", "lot at least", "29:05", "used to happen a lot there's a lot of", "29:07", "fakers that have", "29:08", "you know the thing in martial arts world", "29:10", "was always uh chi", "29:12", "and uh you know you talk about that in", "29:13", "the book as well um about people having", "29:16", "this this power this chi", "29:17", "touch and it was 99.9", "29:21", "horseshit meaning that most of the", "29:23", "people that were talking about it were", "29:24", "really teaching sort of a fraudulent", "29:27", "made-up version of martial arts and", "29:29", "there's a bunch of", "29:30", "instagram pages that are dedicated to", "29:32", "these people it's really to to make", "29:34", "fun of them because it's so strange it's", "29:37", "there's it's such a weird thing that", "29:39", "these people do", "29:40", "where they have huge class fulls of", "29:43", "people", "29:43", "and they pretend to have this death", "29:45", "touch and they touch people", "29:46", "and the people are they're essentially", "29:48", "in a cult and so they spasm they fall to", "29:50", "the ground", "29:51", "and it always made me laugh but there", "29:53", "was a part of me that", "29:54", "says there is a there's a thing in the", "29:57", "body", "29:59", "and this thing can be activated whether", "30:01", "it's", "30:02", "whether you want to call it energy or", "30:04", "spirit there's", "30:05", "there's different mindsets and", "30:09", "inspiration and through these different", "30:11", "mindsets and inspiration you can achieve", "30:13", "some pretty spectacular results", "30:15", "physical results and people that are in", "30:18", "this mindset", "30:20", "they they can perform better there's", "30:22", "something about them in terms of martial", "30:24", "arts there's something about that", "30:25", "so i've always wondered like if someone", "30:28", "really pursued this without all the", "30:30", "nonsense without all

"claiming to have these", "30:40", "these skills that are incredible why not", "30:43", "measure it", "30:44", "i mean it's not that hard to measure", "30:46", "stuff and so if they", "30:48", "deny being having any any lab work done", "30:52", "or having it being measured then then i", "30:53", "think you have to be a little", "30:54", "apprehensive", "30:55", "you know and and that's something that", "30:58", "so much of this technology is cheap now", "31:01", "to get so even if if you were to show up", "31:03", "with with two thousand dollars worth of", "31:05", "equipment you could see", "31:06", "if there was some scientific basis to", "31:08", "what these people are doing", "31:10", "but from my understanding i didn't go", "31:12", "down the chi hole too", "31:13", "too deep but a lot of these people", "31:15", "aren't aren't showing up", "31:16", "and and offering volunteering to have", "31:19", "their skills", "31:20", "you know tested and and that's how", "31:22", "science works you have to test it right", "31:24", "it has to be replicable", "31:25", "well it's everybody wants to be swami", "31:27", "rama but nobody wants to do what swami", "31:30", "rama did right yeah who wants to sit in", "31:32", "a kit well some people do sit in a cave", "31:34", "for 30 years", "31:35", "right yeah he would go away for years at", "31:37", "a time in a dark cave", "31:39", "and just sit there and breathe so i just", "31:41", "in the modern age", "31:42", "i just don't know freaked that guy must", "31:44", "have been kata would", "31:46", "love to talk to him yeah he he had it", "31:48", "all down", "31:49", "because there are people that can do", "31:51", "that you know they're like the unabomber", "31:52", "of breathing you know they just moved to", "31:54", "the woods and", "31:55", "just just without the negativity but but", "31:58", "what was", "31:59", "what was cool about him is he wasn't the", "32:01", "only one who could do this", "32:03", "so there were researchers in the 20s and", "32:05", "in the 40s who went out with a bunch of", "32:07", "equipment whatever equipment they could", "32:09", "cobble together", "32:10", "and tested other yogis who

get that story and what is", "32:32", "what", "32:33", "what is the history of these people", "32:34", "doing this like what what was their", "32:36", "initial motivation i mean is there a", "32:39", "written history of this", "32:40", "the earliest evidence that we have for", "32:43", "breathing practices dates back about", "32:44", "four thousand or five thousand years", "32:46", "from these little statuettes", "32:47", "in the indus valley which is in northern", "32:51", "india", "32:51", "so there was this huge thriving", "32:53", "civilization", "32:54", "they had paved roads they had running", "32:56", "water they were dealing with tin", "32:59", "and copper and they had no in this in", "33:01", "this whole civilization", "33:03", "they still have not found any political",

are now and they", "33:14", "had all of these figures of these people", "33:16", "in these", "33:17", "these yoga poses with their stomachs out", "33:20", "so that's how they date the earliest", "33:22", "archaeological evidence of that and", "33:24", "since then", "33:26", "then all of these practices were moved", "33:28", "into the rig veda", "33:30", "and and all of the earliest yoga texts", "33:34", "and they were codified in the yoga", "33:36", "sutras", "33:37", "of patanjali is that's where a lot of", "33:40", "the the yoga methods come from and", "33:41", "that's about 2 000 years old", "33:43", "so the methods predate all that", "33:47", "oh i'm sure they they predate probably", "33:49", "anything that that has been in writing", "33:52", "that's what's so curious to me what", "33:54", "makes me so curious if you", "33:55", "really think about what life must have", "33:57", "been like back then", "33:59", "the when they were creating this you", "34:01", "would think that people were hunting and", "34:03", "gathering it was probably a very hard", "34:04", "life well not not in that civilization", "34:07", "um right but they got to a point where", "34:10", "they had some sort of agriculture", "34:12", "or some some structures and buildings", "34:14", "but how did they get to the point", "34:16", "where because the rest of the world", "34:17", "didn't obviously didn't do this this is", "34:19", "not like common practice in", "34:20", "germany or in italy or in all these", "34:23", "other civilizations like what", "34:24", "made these people focus on breath work", "34:28", "so much", "34:28", "well it could have been but we just", "34:30", "haven't found anything related to that", "34:32", "yet", "34:32", "right so if you think about hunter", "34:35", "gatherers we're imagining them as", "34:37", "man they're just working all day they're", "34:38", "hunting all day they're gathering", "34:40", "they weren't from from what i know and", "34:42", "from what i've seen of the science there", "34:45", "probably three or four hours of work you", "34:47", "know and then you have no other", "34:48", "distractions to spend time and and build", "34:51", "these systems", "34:52", "of breathing and health which is what", "34:54", "started in ancient", "34:56", "china which is what started in india", "34:57", "which is what started in

and there's nothing else to do", "35:09", "you're going to get more interested and", "35:10", "you're going to have the time to do some", "35:12", "empirical studies to", "35:13", "to see what works and what doesn't it", "35:16", "just seems to me that like", "35:18", "learning something like that learning", "35:21", "something like", "35:22", "prolonged breath work and the benefits", "35:25",

who", "35:35", "has a serious problem maybe someone", "35:37", "who's already very fit", "35:38", "it's going to take a while to really see", "35:40", "those big benefits", "35:41", "we see that with athletes with nasal", "35:43", "breathing it takes some weeks or", "35:45", "sometimes months to really see", "35:46", "gains in performance but if you've got", "35:48", "someone with a chronic condition like", "35:50", "asthma", "35:51", "or anxiety who are struggling to breathe", "35:53", "every single day", "35:54", "and you teach them some basic breathing", "35:56", "some normal breathing patterns", "35:58", "their lives can be absolutely", "36:00", "transformed we've seen this in study", "36:03", "after study so these people their", "36:05", "breathing has become", "36:06",

people", "36:16", "like that", "36:17", "they can see the benefits in a couple of", "36:19", "hours", "36:20", "maybe even less than that someone with", "36:22", "high blood pressure right now", "36:24", "if they're sitting at home they can take", "36:26", "their blood pressure", "36:27", "and then breathe at a rate of about six", "36:29", "seconds in six seconds out", "36:31", "take their blood pressure after that and", "36:33", "there's a good chance their blood", "36:35", "pressure is going to go down i've seen", "36:36", "mine go down 10", "36:37", "10 or 15 points just by breathing", "36:39", "because your body is operating", "36:41", "in its most efficient way that way and", "36:43", "know how over how long", "36:44", "a period of time would take your blood", "36:46",

there's", "36:54", "devices that they sell now", "36:55", "which trains people to sit down take a", "36:58", "seat", "36:59", "and breathe in a certain pattern for 10", "37:01", "or 15 minutes and

focus on your", "37:11", "breath right we have the technology", "37:14", "in our heads we have lungs we have a", "37:17", "nose", "37:17", "we can use that to to really help", "37:20", "optimize our health", "37:21", "and what what is the benefit for", "37:23", "asthmatics the benefit for asthmatics is", "37:25", "they", "37:26", "traditionally uh oftentimes mouth", "37:29", "breathe not all the time", "37:31", "they very often times are breathing too", "37:33", "much so", "37:34", "you see an asthmatic", "37:37", "that's usually how they breathe because", "37:40", "they are offloading all of the co2", "37:42", "by offloading that co2 they are causing", "37:44", "constriction", "37:45", "and they're so paranoid that they're", "37:47", "going to have an asthma attack that", "37:48", "every time they feel it coming on", "37:50", "they go guess what happens when you", "37:53", "start breathing more and more you're", "37:54", "causing more constriction", "37:56", "so they teach them to take control of", "37:59", "their breath", "38:00", "to relax at those times so that's what", "38:02", "hyperventilating", "38:03", "is yes and there's a study done about 10", "38:06", "years ago", "38:07", "one of the best studies that came across", "38:08", "where they took 120 asthmatics", "38:11", "and the technology they used to treat", "38:13", "them was breathing they would have them", "38:14", "bring around this capnometer", "38:16", "which would gauge their co2 every time", "38:19", "their co2 started getting low which", "38:20", "meant they were breathing too much", "38:22",

health their", "38:32", "airways got larger", "38:33", "so just just by breathing and this is a", "38:36", "this is a well-known study it's", "38:37", "available for anyone to look up", "38:38", "so what do you know what causes asthma", "38:40", "is it just a genetic", "38:42", "it's an allergic reaction it's an", "38:44", "inflammatory reaction", "38:45", "so there's different types of asthma", "38:47", "there's allergic asthma there's", "38:48", "exercise-induced asthma which is caused", "38:50", "by breathing too much", "38:52", "um and a lot of people think oh i was", "38:54", "born with asthma i'm stuck with asthma", "38:56", "that's that could be true for a lot of", "38:58", "people who don't want to take", "39:00", "some some additional measures to help", "39:02", "abate the symptoms of that asthma and i", "39:04", "think we're just finding now", "39:06", "a lot of really legit solid science", "39:08", "showing", "39:09", "that breathing is implicated both in the", "39:11", "onset of asthma but it can also be used", "39:14", "as a", "39:14", "tool to help attenuate the symptoms of", "39:16", "it so", "39:18", "when you're if it's like if you're", "39:21", "talking to someone with asthma what", "39:23", "would you like my friend hannibal", "39:24", "he has he was here yesterday he was", "39:26", "telling a story about freaking out on", "39:28", "mushrooms and hyperventilating and", "39:30", "how to get his inhaler what would you", "39:32", "tell someone", "39:33", "like him who's an asthmatic i would", "39:36", "first tell him i'm not a breathing", "39:37", "therapist", "39:38", "i'm not a doctor and he should continue", "39:40", "going to his doctor and taking his", "39:41", "bronco dilators so i'm a journalist who", "39:43", "went into this field", "39:45", "with zero slant with zero objective", "39:48", "then i would tell him after that", "39:50", "disclaimer that", "39:51", "i would seek a therapist who has", "39:53", "experience dealing with asthmatics", "39:56", "and using breathing to help them is that", "39:58", "common", "39:59", "they they are out there and and they're", "40:01", "starting to grow", "40:02", "uh papworth method was developed in", "40:05", "england in the 1960s really effective", "40:08", "a system called bouteka breathing has", "40:10", "shown there's a lot of quackery in", "40:12", "buteyko so be careful who you're using", "40:15", "a lot of people have taken up uh", "40:18", "buteyko techniques and appointed", "40:21", "themselves", "40:22", "as breathing therapists and they don't", "40:23", "know that", "40:25", "they don't know the basis of how exactly", "40:27", "what is buteyko", "40:28", "buteyko is a system of of allowing you", "40:32", "to help you to breathe less and to", "40:34", "breathe slowly", "40:35", "and it's been pretty extensively studied", "40:38", "with asthma in particular it's good for", "40:40", "hypertension as well", "40:41", "so i would find a therapist who has a", "40:44", "knowledge of this", "40:45", "patrick mcewan has been doing this for", "40:47", "20 years", "40:48", "he's rock solid he's done the science", "40:50", "and he cured his own", "40:52", "allergies severe asthma and allergies he", "40:54", "said why the hell", "40:56", "isn't anyone else doing this and so he", "40:58", "stopped when he was a business major and", "41:00", "stopped and and this is he's written", "41:02", "like four books on this stuff so it's", "41:04", "it's his name again patrick mcewen", "41:06", "patrick yeah", "41:07", "irish dude and breathing less", "41:11", "see that sounds very counterintuitive to", "41:12", "people when you say breathing less", "41:14", "like what are you talking about you're", "41:16", "supposed to breathe a lot right like the", "41:18", "more you breathe the more air you get", "41:20", "right yeah this is such a contrarian", "41:22", "concept it took me months", "41:23", "to really figure out what was going on", "41:25", "here so", "41:27", "most of us breathe too much just like", "41:30", "most of the population is eating too", "41:32", "much", "41:32", "when we're taking in that much air we're", "41:34", "just breathing it back out", "41:36", "so 75 of the oxygen we take in we", "41:38", "breathe back out", "41:40", "so if we're breathing if we're just", "41:41", "sitting here now", "41:43", "and i'm doing this i'm not gaining any", "41:46", "oxygen i'm actually making it harder for", "41:48", "my body to offload oxygen into the", "41:50", "tissues muscles and organs", "41:52", "is that because it takes time for your", "41:54", "body to take the oxygen in through the", "41:56", "breath and disperse it through the body", "41:58", "yeah it's two things so it's the co2", "42:00", "when i'm breathing like this", "42:03", "i'm offloading too much co2 and without", "42:05", "that co2 i'm not getting that", "42:06", "vasodilation i'm not getting that", "42:08", "circulation", "42:09", "which is why just doing that a little", "42:11", "lightness in my head you know my fingers", "42:13", "get a little tingly just doing that just", "42:14", "just from that", "42:16", "try keep keep going so as you're doing", "42:20", "that", "42:20", "you're gonna you're gonna feel a little", "42:22", "dizzy you'll probably feel", "42:24", "some circulation problems in your hands", "42:26", "and fingers", "42:29", "you can do this for two hours and you'll", "42:32", "really see what i'm saying", "42:34", "so the the point the point by breathing", "42:36", "less", "42:37", "and deeply is to optimize each of those", "42:39", "breaths as much as you can to give your", "42:41", "body more time to extract that oxygen", "42:43", "and you want to do that through the nose", "42:45", "because that pressure", "42:47", "of breathing and helps the lungs in that", "42:49", "gas exchange", "42:50", "so if you know someone that has a", "42:52", "deviated septan you would instantly", "42:53", "recommend them get that fixed", "42:54", "this is this is what i have so 75 of the", "42:57", "population", "42:58", "has a deviated septum that is clearly", "43:00", "visible to the naked eye", "43:02", "so i've had my nose broken two or three", "43:04", "times", "43:05", "so i'm as when they took a cat scan in", "43:06", "my head i'm as more messed up as", "43:08", "anyone naik said you were the perfect", "43:10", "candidate for surgery", "43:11", "but i tried to see what i could do", "43:13", "outside of surgery i know people who", "43:14", "have been abs", "43:15", "just like you had their health", "43:16", "transformed by it it's very important", "43:19", "but there are also people who don't", "43:21", "necessarily need it and should start by", "43:24", "practicing some breathing methods you", "43:26", "didn't get surgery i did not know", "43:27", "interesting and and i changed uh my", "43:30", "airways and i changed", "43:31", "how my nose worked over the course of a", "43:33", "year we took cat scans before and after", "43:35", "just by breathing you know how people", "43:37", "get cauliflower ear", "43:38", "do you know that from calcified blood", "43:40", "gets trapped inside the tissues", "43:42", "my nose was filled like that so i really", "43:44", "did need surgery", "43:45", "and my nose had probably been broken", "43:49", "i broke my nose the first time i was", "43:51", "five falling down a flight of stairs", "43:52", "and then a lifetime of combat sports i i", "43:56", "don't i don't know how many times i", "43:57", "broke it", "43:58", "it easily could be more than a dozen", "44:00", "it's and that's why you were a perfect", "44:02", "candidate for this and it changed your", "44:03", "life", "44:04", "yeah but it was surgery yeah no but", "44:06", "that's what i'm talking about surgical", "44:08", "interventions are absolutely necessary", "44:10", "for a large part of the population i had", "44:12", "one quarter of one nostril that was open", "44:16", "my right nostril was useless like", "44:18", "totally closed up", "44:20", "i mean when i would try to breathe it'd", "44:21", "be like yeah", "44:23", "nothing would go through that's bad news", "44:25", "yeah i'd go to yoga class did you go", "44:27", "breathe through your nose like", "44:28", "my nose is useless and if you listen", "44:30", "like if someone hears me from like the", "44:32", "fear factor days and you listen to my", "44:35", "voice it's a different", "44:36", "voice it's a more nasally voice because", "44:38", "my nose was", "44:39", "stuffed all the time i had to breathe", "44:41", "out of my mouth", "44:42", "but but for someone like you now you", "44:44", "know the benefits of nasal breathing", "44:45", "right", "44:46", "just the cardio benefits alone was crazy", "44:49", "it's like i gained 10", "44:51", "cardio instantly yeah and i've heard", "44:53", "this numerous times by", "44:54", "by so many people so what you're doing", "44:57", "when you're breathing through the nose", "44:58", "is you're slowing down that breath", "45:00", "you you're taking in less breath but", "45:01", "you're using more of it", "45:03", "so by breathing less you're going to be", "45:05", "able to", "45:06", "lower your heart rate and and we know", "45:08", "this if anyone has a pulse oximeter at", "45:10", "home", "45:10", "you would think that breathing six", "45:12", "breaths a minute which is about a third", "45:14", "of what's considered normal", "45:16", "you think there's no way i'm getting", "45:17", "enough oxygen right that's impossible", "45:19", "put on a pulse ox and watch what happens", "45:22", "and what i've found is your oxygen's", "45:24", "either going to stay the same or", "45:25", "sometimes go up we even got on", "45:27", "stationary bikes with it on the stanford", "45:29", "experiment", "45:30", "and we're trying to see if we could", "45:31", "breathe six breaths a minute while going", "45:33", "as hard as", "45:34", "hard as we could and watching what", "45:35", "happened to our oxygen and our oxygen", "45:37", "did not go down once we got to about", "45:39", "three or four breaths per minute", "45:41", "it started going down as long as you", "45:43", "have these huge breaths", "45:45", "right this huge circle you're", "45:51", "and you can work out that way and", "45:52", "they've found dr

"fascinating to me is uh the sport that i", "52:21", "commentate on", "52:22", "mixed martial arts there's a giant issue", "52:24", "with broken gnosis", "52:26", "a large percentage of the fighters have", "52:29", "deviated septums", "52:30", "smashed in noses they're clogged up and", "52:33", "you see them breathing out of their", "52:34", "mouth particularly when they're tired", "52:36", "you see like when when a fighter has", "52:39", "their nose broken", "52:40", "and you see blood trickling down the", "52:41", "nose one of the first signs you see is", "52:43", "they breathe out of their mouth", "52:45", "and that seems like", "52:48", "well obviously it's terrible to get", "52:50", "punched in the nose right", "52:51", "it's you have this delicate instrument", "52:53", "and you're using it as a target", "52:55", "but for someone who does", "52:59", "get punched in those for a living like", "53:01", "what can they do", "53:03", "if they have this other than not do it", "53:07", "i think do what you did right so if", "53:09", "you're talking about these things but", "53:11", "i'm not", "53:11", "fighting anymore if i was fighting i", "53:13", "don't know if i would get it fit well i", "53:15", "guess i probably would anyway now that i", "53:17", "know", "53:18", "but a lot of guys don't because they", "53:19", "they think they're just going to get it", "53:20", "broken again", "53:21", "well first for those extreme cases", "53:24", "they're going to need surgical", "53:25", "intervention if you can't breathe", "53:26", "through your nose you have to find a way", "53:27", "so nyack the guy at stanford told me", "53:29", "if your toilet is clogged what are you", "53:31", "going to do you're going to find a way", "53:33", "of cleaning it out and getting that", "53:35", "flowing again and when it clogs again", "53:36", "just fix it again", "53:39", "that's one one way of doing it or you", "53:41", "could make a permanent fix to it right", "53:43", "yeah um so so that it's always", "53:45", "functioning if someone's used to getting", "53:47", "punched in the nose", "53:48", "every month and their their nose is", "53:49", "getting broken again you know that", "53:51", "that's gonna be really hard to nasal", "53:53", "breathe", "53:54", "so so i think that either they need to", "53:56", "stop getting punched in the nose or", "53:58", "or they have to make some other", "53:59", "lifestyle choices you know if they want", "54:01", "to continue doing that they're going to", "54:02", "have a hard time nasal breathing that", "54:04", "just seems like", "54:05", "simple physics but it's so crazy because", "54:08", "it is", "54:08", "one of the more difficult things to do", "54:11", "athletically", "54:12", "and athletically it seems from your work", "54:16", "and the work that you're citing that", "54:17", "would be of extreme benefit to learn how", "54:19", "to breathe through your nose", "54:20", "but yet most of them can't yeah and and", "54:23", "this is i asked patrick mcewan this", "54:25", "he's like when you're competing you do", "54:27", "what you can to compete", "54:29", "you you do what you can to win which is", "54:31", "why if you see michael jordan", "54:32", "right before he dunks on someone he goes", "54:36", "he takes this huge breath of air that", "54:38", "one breath of air is not going to affect", "54:40", "his endurance or his performance right", "54:42", "this is it's about habitual nasal", "54:44", "breathing and breathing while you're", "54:46", "training", "54:46", "if someone has a bloody nose or", "54:48", "something is stuffed up there you have", "54:50", "to", "54:50", "breathe somehow right right you're going", "54:52", "to breathe through your mouth", "54:54", "especially for for boxers you know yeah", "54:56", "it is interesting though you look at any", "54:58", "other animal in the wild", "55:00", "and look at a horse running like a", "55:02", "full-on sprint", "55:03", "it's never breathing right ever look at", "55:05", "a cheetah", "55:06", "like hunting hunting down some prey it's", "55:08", "never breathing out of its mouth", "55:10", "horses are when they start breathing out", "55:12", "of their mouths", "55:13", "they're in deep trouble right and dogs", "55:15", "just do it to", "55:16", "cool themselves off thermal regulation", "55:18", "that's right yep", "55:20", "um the carbon dioxide thing is a is a", "55:23", "real trip", "55:25", "what when you're saying that this need", "55:27", "to", "55:28", "take a deep breath is really because", "55:31", "your body recognizes the level of", "55:33", "carbon dioxide is very high what", "55:37", "what happens when you become accustomed", "55:40", "to holding your breath like what are", "55:42", "there physiological changes that are", "55:44", "taking place", "55:45", "so this is what dr justin feinstein is", "55:47", "working on right now the laureate", "55:49", "institute of brain research", "55:51", "he has found that asthmatics and people", "55:53", "with anxiety", "55:54", "have this extremely low threshold for", "55:57", "co2", "55:58", "so they need to keep breathing they're", "56:00", "so paranoid that they're not going to be", "56:02", "able to breathe that they've", "56:04", "become accustomed to", "56:08", "and whenever that co2 increases they", "56:10", "freak out", "56:12", "so he is found by slowly acclimating", "56:15", "them to have", "56:16", "more of a to be able to take more co2", "56:19", "and become more comfortable with it", "56:21", "that's how they can change their", "56:22", "breathing that's how they can change", "56:23", "their habits", "56:24", "which is exactly what those asthma", "56:27", "techniques do", "56:28", "right they teach these people to breathe", "56:30", "less and to breathe slowly to slowly", "56:33", "acclimate themselves like someone with", "56:34", "asthma or panic don't go and start", "56:36", "holding your breath as long as you can", "56:38", "that's a bad idea like let the body", "56:40", "adjust", "56:42", "slowly yeah so i was a recently around", "56:44", "someone", "56:45", "having a panic attack and what she was", "56:47", "saying is i can't breathe", "56:49", "i'm having a hard time breathing", "56:50", "obviously she was breathing and she was", "56:51", "talking but she was like", "56:52", "i can't breathe what would you say to a", "56:56", "person who's doing that just try to get", "56:57", "them to calm down", "56:58", "slowly breathe like what would you what", "57:00", "would you say i would quote uh dr alicia", "57:03", "moret", "57:03", "at southern methodist university who", "57:05", "said the idea that people should be", "57:07", "breathing more when they have panic is", "57:09", "exactly the opposite of what they should", "57:10", "be doing so they should be", "57:12", "what is happening is their co2 levels", "57:14", "are getting so low what they need to do", "57:16", "is breathe more slowly or hold their", "57:17", "breath", "57:18", "can you increase your tolerance for co2", "57:22", "like this is that like a physical thing", "57:24", "or is it a mental thing", "57:26", "absolutely it's a physical thing there", "57:28", "are chemoreceptors right around here", "57:30", "right and these are the things that", "57:31", "gauge levels of co2", "57:33", "so if you think about a free diver what", "57:35", "allows them to hold their breath", "57:37", "for four five six seven eight minutes", "57:39", "they've they've gotten this threshold of", "57:41", "co2 that's very high", "57:42", "compared to me or you or anyone else you", "57:44", "think about someone who's able to summit", "57:46", "everest", "57:46", "without oxygen right they've got this", "57:49", "threshold of co2", "57:51", "so so much of fitness not not all of it", "57:54", "but", "57:54", "a lot of it is dictated by by the level", "57:58", "of co2 that you can withstand at least", "58:00", "with with", "58:00", "surfing or with free diving or with with", "58:04", "alpine climbing so these receptors you", "58:07", "train them or they get stronger is it", "58:10", "like an endurance thing like you know", "58:11", "your cardiovascular endurance increases", "58:13", "your", "58:13", "resting heart rate decreases like is", "58:15", "that happen with these", "58:17", "carbon dioxide receptors you can you can", "58:20", "train them", "58:21", "yeah yeah you can acclimate them to", "58:23", "accept", "58:24", "a higher threshold of co2 so that you", "58:27", "become comfortable with it so", "58:29", "one of the hard things about training to", "58:30", "free dive is those breath holds at the", "58:32", "beginning you do these static breath", "58:34", "holds not in water never in water", "58:36", "but on land you see how long you can", "58:38", "hold your breath and they're miserable", "58:40", "people you know maybe hold their breath", "58:42", "maximum two minutes", "58:43", "but once you get used to it you can go", "58:45", "four minutes and what is what is", "58:46", "happening", "58:47", "when you're getting used to it you are", "58:49", "allowing those those signals those those", "58:51", "chemoreceptors", "58:52", "are going off and sending messages to", "58:54", "your amygdala which is the area in the", "58:56", "brain that dictates", "58:57", "fear and

try to hold my breath i'm like what is", "59:13", "wrong with me", "59:14", "like why is it do i have a weak mind", "59:16", "like what is it why am i giving in", "59:19", "what is that thing so what he's doing", "59:22", "he's found that", "59:23", "he's been trying to train people in", "59:25", "mindfulness and trying to", "59:26", "train these people in breathing", "59:28", "practices but it's really hard", "59:30", "because he can't be with them 24 hours a", "59:31", "day so what he's", "59:33", "he's now experimenting with and he's got", "59:35", "an nih", "59:36", "grant to do this is instead of having", "59:39", "them", "59:39", "practice these mini breath holds", "59:41", "throughout the day he's having them come", "59:42", "in", "59:43", "and take a huge inhale of co2 because", "59:46", "his hypothesis", "59:47", "is that that can help reset the", "59:50", "tolerance of those chemoreceptors", "59:53", "um and shortcut yeah it's a little", "59:56", "because you know it's the modern age no", "59:58", "one wants to actually put in the work", "60:00", "right we don't want this funny rama i", "60:03", "think a lot of people want to be swami", "60:05", "rama because no one wants the 30 years", "60:06", "in a cave", "60:07", "yeah um and what is his results of these", "60:10", "people", "60:11", "taking in the burst of co2 it is it is", "60:13", "too soon to say", "60:14", "he is going to be publishing everything", "60:16", "uh next year the year after that", "60:18", "excellent", "60:18", "he's in the middle of it right now but", "60:20", "but the premise of it makes makes", "60:22", "perfect sense to me and this is why", "60:25", "it describes and explains why so many of", "60:27", "these slow", "60:28", "breathing less practices are so", "60:30",

basically probably where i", "65:08", "got it from jiu-jitsu", "65:10", "um but i can breathe out of my nose", "65:13", "so do you think that sleep apnea would", "65:15", "still occur if i'd breathe

people", "66:40", "get some benefit from it and that's", "66:41", "great", "66:42", "uh i do know that tape is almost free", "66:46", "um and i've seen some incredible results", "66:49", "myself subjectively", "66:50", "but they're also doing some studies and", "66:52", "if you look at berhany's work that he's", "66:54", "done for the past", "66:55", "few decades i mean it's it's a quick and", "66:58", "easy fix that can work for a lot of", "67:00", "people and this is something that you", "67:01", "use", "67:02", "every night i use it every night when i", "67:03", "don't guess what happens", "67:05", "yeah my mouth comes something you start", "67:07", "snoring yeah and i", "67:08", "and i wish that i didn't have to i would", "67:11", "figure at this time that", "67:12", "it would become habit but i'm not one of", "67:14", "those people who have that really strong", "67:16", "jaw", "67:17", "that stays shut it's my mouth just just", "67:20", "opens and", "67:21", "the difference in quality of sleep from", "67:22", "doing this has been has been profound", "67:24", "i'm glad you brought that up because", "67:25", "that was something else i wanted to talk", "67:26",

jaw", "67:37", "and that there's a way to improve that", "67:39", "which i found fascinating", "67:41", "yeah and this was something when you set", "67:42", "out to write a book about breathing the", "67:44", "last thing you think you're going to be", "67:45", "doing is", "67:46", "handing you know around a bunch of", "67:48", "ancient skulls and and looking at teeth", "67:50", "but but that's where this", "67:51", "journey led me i had heard from some", "67:54", "biological", "67:55", "anthropologists that our faces have", "67:57", "changed", "67:58", "and that our mouths have gotten too", "68:00", "small and that was one of the reasons so", "68:02", "many of us were breathing so poorly", "68:04", "and so i thought well this sounds", "68:06", "interesting these people are legit i", "68:07", "want to check it out", "68:09", "and if you take an ancient skull", "68:11", "anything older than 500 years old", "68:14", "5 000 years old 50 000 years old you're", "68:16", "gonna see by and large about 99", "68:19", "chance these skulls are going to have", "68:20", "perfectly straight teeth", "68:22", "they never had their wisdom teeth", "68:23", "removed they never had braces", "68:25", "any orthodontic anything they had", "68:28", "straight teeth", "68:29", "because they had these very wide and", "68:30", "large mouths and these powerful jaws", "68:33", "if you start getting into the modern era", "68:35", "of industrialized food", "68:36", "mouths start shrinking so why do we have", "68:39", "crooked teeth", "68:41", "not from genetics it's because our", "68:43", "mouths have grown so small that the", "68:45", "teeth have nowhere to go", "68:46", "so they grow crooked and what else", "68:49", "happens when you have a mouth that's too", "68:51", "small for its teeth", "68:52", "you have a smaller airway so this is one", "68:54", "of the reasons why so many people have", "68:56", "snoring sleep apnea and other", "68:58", "respiratory problems this sounded so", "69:00", "bizarre because there's nothing i'd ever", "69:03", "learned in school", "69:04", "but all anyone needs to do is look up", "69:06", "some ancient skulls if you're online", "69:08", "and check out their teeth and check out", "69:11", "how they have these", "69:12", "huge jaws these big flat wide faces", "69:15", "powerful faces and they all had this and", "69:18", "then you go into the wild", "69:20", "5 400 different mammals and check out", "69:22", "and see how many have crooked teeth", "69:24", "the answer is zero so some some bulldogs", "69:28", "do", "69:28", "because they've been bred to have this", "69:30", "flat face just like humans", "69:32", "yeah but but animals in the wild have", "69:34", "straight teeth", "69:35", "and and we did too as a species we", "69:39", "we have straight teeth but um but", "69:41", "because of", "69:42", "industrialization specifically because", "69:44", "of food", "69:45", "our mouths have grown too small you", "69:47", "would never believe that like if someone", "69:49", "told me that other than reading your", "69:51", "book", "69:51", "and and kind of understanding where", "69:53", "you're where you're coming from i would", "69:55", "think", "69:55", "this is nonsense it's genetics just like", "69:58", "why people have small hands or people", "70:00", "have big feet or whatever", "70:02", "well it's become a heritable trait so so", "70:04", "what's happened now is", "70:06", "they've found the researchers who who've", "70:08", "done this robert corcini worked on this", "70:10", "stuff for 30 years his 250", "70:12", "scientific papers on it they found", "70:14", "within the first generation of switching", "70:16", "to industrialized foods", "70:17", "about 50 of the population is going to", "70:19", "have malocclusion which means it crooked", "70:21", "jaw crooked teeth", "70:23", "after that about 60 to 70 percent next", "70:26", "generation after that", "70:27", "about 80 after that look around that's", "70:30", "us now about 90 percent", "70:32", "jesus so if if sorry no", "70:35", "i was going to put me on a little more", "70:37", "so so there uh dr kevin boyd is now", "70:39", "doing studies where", "70:40", "he's looking at fetuses in the womb and", "70:42", "is seeing their", "70:44", "mouth size is too small and they have", "70:46", "this backward slant to their faces just", "70:48", "like i have", "70:49", "just like so many people in the", "70:50", "population have if you were to measure a", "70:53", "skull", "70:54", "and you were to draw one line from its", "70:56", "ear to its nose and another line", "70:58", "perpendicular to that", "71:00", "almost every single ancient skull would", "71:02", "be above that line", "71:04", "very powerful jaw now ninety percent of", "71:07", "modern skulls", "71:08", "are below it so they are behind it", "71:11", "so and this is happening now it is", "71:13", "becoming a heritable trait", "71:15", "so so kids are messed up to to begin", "71:18", "with which is why so many kids are", "71:20", "have sleep apnea and snore now which is", "71:23", "so", "71:23", "injurious to their to their health and", "71:26", "this came about because they weren't", "71:28", "chewing tougher food they didn't need", "71:31", "the muscles", "71:32", "and what can be done to sort of reverse", "71:35", "that or mitigate that", "71:37", "in adulthood it's harder in in for kids", "71:39", "it's much easier because their muscles", "71:41", "are", "71:42", "and their bones are much more malleable", "71:44", "but that's exactly what they found is", "71:46", "once you introduce we used to chew for", "71:48", "about four hours a day", "71:49", "okay that's just how it was from the", "71:52", "dawn of time", "71:52", "to to about 500 years ago but as", "71:56", "wheat started getting processed into", "71:58", "white flour as", "72:00", "rice became we started taking the germ", "72:02", "and the bran away from rice so it's just", "72:04", "the polished seed", "72:05", "as things began to get canned and", "72:08", "bottled", "72:08", "if you think about even what's", "72:10", "considered healthy food right now", "72:12", "smoothies avocado oatmeal", "72:15", "all this stuff is soft power bars right", "72:18", "so in adulthood there you can make some", "72:21", "changes and that that's what i", "72:23", "i tried to do in my own face as as a", "72:26", "experiment uh for kids what they're", "72:28", "finding is", "72:29", "these problems need to be diagnosed very", "72:32", "early", "72:32", "and they need to be treated and what", "72:34", "they do is they widen the mouth", "72:36", "to the way that they were supposed to be", "72:39", "500 years ago so we're", "72:41", "changing our bodies by by force of will", "72:43", "to the way that", "72:44", "the nature had made them before we", "72:46", "messed them up", "72:48", "there was a doctor that you were talking", "72:49", "about that developed some sort of a", "72:50", "retainer that actually changed the", "72:52", "volume of your jaw as an adult and", "72:54", "changed the volume of your mouth that's", "72:55", "right so", "72:57", "um i had crooked teeth growing up i had", "72:59", "braces i had extractions i had gear and", "73:02", "me and everyone i knew had the same", "73:04", "thing it was never", "73:06", "if you were gonna get it it's just when", "73:07", "are you gonna get your braces right", "73:09", "so the point of all those things was to", "73:11", "straighten teeth but they're not looking", "73:13", "at airway health", "73:14", "right so so what happens just as a", "73:16", "principle you've got", "73:18", "a mouth that's too small for its face", "73:19", "the teeth are growing and crooked", "73:21", "you extract teeth from that get some", "73:23", "headgear and go", "73:26", "you're creating at least there's a", "73:28", "significant argument by many people in", "73:29", "the field that say you're making a small", "73:31", "mouth smaller", "73:32", "and and one leader in the field dr", "73:34", "michael gelb is that 50", "73:36", "of people who have orthodontics are", "73:38", "going to", "73:39", "have more breathing problems because of", "73:41", "it orthodontics meaning braces as well", "73:44", "braces are craning in so it's", "73:46", "combination of braces and especially", "73:47", "head gear", "73:48", "and and some of that stuff is being", "73:50", "phased out braces are still you're", "73:52", "forcing teeth", "73:53", "into a smaller space to make them to", "73:56", "make them straight", "73:57", "so there's this the very first", "73:59", "orthodontics", "74:01", "weren't craning teeth in to make them", "74:03", "straight", "74:04", "they would expand the mouth because even", "74:06", "back then 120 years ago they knew our", "74:08", "mouths were growing too small", "74:10", "they they knew that so the first devices", "74:12", "i thought this was fascinating", "74:14", "they were using this for kids who had", "74:15", "cleft palates and all of these other", "74:17", "problems where they were having problems", "74:19", "chewing", "74:20", "and and breathing so they would expand", "74:22", "their mouths with this device that went", "74:24", "to the roof of your mouth", "74:25", "and it had a little dowel screw and it", "74:27", "and you slowly opened it up to expand", "74:30", "the mount", "74:30", "what does it feel like um it doesn't", "74:33", "feel great", "74:34", "so uh this is where i think a lot of", "74:36", "orthodontics is heading", "74:37", "because it allows you to have straighter", "74:40", "teeth", "74:41", "but it also opens your airway but how", "74:43", "long do you keep it in your you keep it", "74:45", "in your mouth like braces all day long", "74:47", "no no the one that i used was called a", "74:49", "homeo block", "74:50", "and this guy had been using it for 30", "74:52", "years and", "74:54", "i used it at night so you put it on the", "74:57", "pallet", "74:58", "upper pallet and you you slow you have", "75:00", "this this little screw thing this little", "75:02", "handle that every couple weeks you open", "75:03", "it a little more", "75:04", "just slowly there it is jamie's got a", "75:06", "picture of it all right", "75:08", "so if you feel that you used one of", "75:10", "those yeah i did", "75:12", "not no none as gnarly as that um this", "75:15", "looks intense", "75:16", "but uh if you feel your head right now", "75:18", "you feel these sutures", "75:20", "right these cracks in your head you have", "75:23", "one of those on your upper palate", "75:25", "so that can open okay that's that's what", "75:29", "it's made to do", "75:30", "it can open and you can widen your mouth", "75:32", "and adulthood and i showed this through", "75:34", "through cat scans and", "75:36", "by that you can open your airway and you", "75:38", "can breathe better", "75:40", "and how long did you wear it for i wore", "75:41", "for one year one year to to the week i", "75:44", "took the other cat scan", "75:46", "and you gained how much volume in your", "75:48", "mouth", "75:49", "i gained about five pennies worth of", "75:52", "bone", "75:52", "in my face which is crazy five pounds", "75:55", "so stack them up yeah five pennies", "75:59", "yeah so that's a lot of bone man so", "76:02", "we've been we've been told", "76:04", "that we can't grow bone past 30 right", "76:06", "it's just", "76:07", "entropy we're only going to be losing we", "76:09", "can we can stop", "76:11", "it from from disappearing we can do some", "76:13", "things to help prevent that loss but we", "76:14", "can't build it", "76:16", "but we can we can build it in the center", "76:18", "of our face", "76:19", "and the maxilla so you can really change", "76:21", "the structure of your face from doing", "76:23", "you could widen your face", "76:25", "you can add more bone you can model more", "76:27", "bone", "76:28", "inside of your face you look better", "76:29", "while you're do you like do you think", "76:30", "you can't", "76:31", "tell you're a good-looking man but i", "76:33", "mean do you

notice", "76:44", "after", "76:44", "after about six weeks of wearing this", "76:46", "thing people were like", "76:48", "dude what happened what are you doing", "76:50", "they could see", "76:51", "a shift absolutely and it's and it's", "76:54", "very apparent and there's", "76:56", "you can see a bunch of case studies on", "76:57", "this and you can see it for yourself and", "76:59", "the neat thing is it's not subjective", "77:01", "it's not well i think i look different", "77:02", "right there's cat scans and there's", "77:04", "metrics to it so", "77:06", "so and it also opened my airways it it", "77:09", "allowed me to expand i don't know how", "77:11", "much is probably", "77:12", "maybe 15 20 but it was a lot mostly", "77:16", "the toning of the airway why did you", "77:18", "stop using it after a year", "77:19", "i'm still using it you are so i for the", "77:22", "book for the research i said i'm going", "77:24", "to do this", "77:25", "for one year and i'm going to wear it", "77:26", "every night um i'm really going to be", "77:28", "dedicated even after having a few", "77:30", "few beers it was like the last thing i", "77:32", "want to do is put this thing in my mouth", "77:34", "and go to sleep", "77:35", "but i did it because i was curious", "77:37", "because i had heard these stories i'd", "77:38", "seen the case studies", "77:40", "i'd see the data but i wanted to see", "77:42", "what would happen in my", "77:43", "in my own body and um i tell you on a", "77:46", "subjective level", "77:47", "i breathe more easily now than i could", "77:49", "ever remember", "77:50", "breathing i haven't had pneumonia", "77:52", "bronchitis any of those problems but", "77:54", "there's a bunch of factors though too", "77:55", "right there's the nose breathing there's", "77:57", "the breath", "77:58", "work so it's a combination of all these", "78:00", "things yeah but but nose breathing", "78:02", "wouldn't help you build more", "78:03", "more bone in your face so a lot of that", "78:05", "was due to", "78:06", "the this device not only spread open", "78:09", "that suture", "78:10", "in the upper palate but also stimulated", "78:12", "chewing stress", "78:13", "so on one side there was this little", "78:16", "bump", "78:16", "so every time you closed your mouth you", "78:18", "got some chewing stress which would", "78:20", "stimulate", "78:21",

boxing your", "78:31", "intense you're clenching your jaws", "78:33", "that does not stimulate that that good", "78:35", "beneficial chewing stress", "78:37", "okay because our bodies identify that as", "78:40", "sympathetic stress so cortisol levels go", "78:42", "up right", "78:43", "that means growth isn't going to happen", "78:45", "but if you think about eating a big", "78:46", "piece of steak", "78:47", "or a carrot you're not chewing on both", "78:49", "sides of your molars", "78:51", "you're chewing on one side or the other", "78:54", "so when you stimulate the stress on one",

"and and you become more relaxed and", "79:07", "that's when that", "79:08", "growth can happen so chewing on one side", "79:11", "or the other", "79:12", "stimulates stem cells that don't get", "79:14", "stimulated if you're just like biting", "79:15", "down on a mouthpiece", "79:16", "because of cortisol and osteoporosis", "79:19", "now how often do you have this thing in", "79:21", "your mouth now", "79:23", "i took a break after a year to see what", "79:25", "life was like", "79:26", "on the other side of that is it nice", "79:28", "it's great", "79:30", "but but i got curious i talked to the", "79:32", "guy who who gave me this device", "79:34", "dr ted belfort and he's used this thing", "79:37", "for for 30 years and", "79:39", "his case studies are pretty fascinating", "79:41", "um", "79:42", "and i talked to him he's like oh we", "79:44", "should do another cat scan see what", "79:45", "happened i", "79:47", "didn't quite admit to him that i had", "79:49", "stopped using it so i felt a little", "79:50", "guilty", "79:51", "and now for the past about month and a", "79:53", "half i've i've been", "79:54", "back on the back on the train to see", "79:56", "what happened so we're going to take", "79:58", "another one", "79:58", "just for for kicks i'm not going to", "80:00", "write about the book's already done but", "80:02", "i just", "80:02", "i'm curious to see what will happen if", "80:04", "you keep wearing this if you can really", "80:06", "keep improving if you're the", "80:07", "swami rama of orthodontics if you could", "80:10", "hold that bad boy in your mouth for a", "80:12", "few years i mean i'd be really", "80:13", "fascinating if you change your face and", "80:15", "all of a sudden you have like this big", "80:17", "clark kent", "80:18", "superman type jaw can you let me shack", "80:20", "up here for a couple years and", "80:22", "i'm just going to focus on this all day", "80:24", "just stay in the sauna too", "80:25", "good do what you got to do um so where", "80:28", "would one get one of these things", "80:30", "there's many different devices so the", "80:32", "one i used was the homeoblock", "80:34", "ted belfor can set you up with that", "80:36", "would you have to go to a doctor to get", "80:37", "measured", "80:38", "yeah yeah you have to go to a dentist um", "80:40", "or an orthodontist", "80:42", "would set you up with this but but", "80:44", "there's many different ones that do the", "80:45", "same thing what a lot of people do", "80:47", "instead of having this thing in your", "80:49", "mouth for a year", "80:50", "they go in and the sound's gnarly", "80:53", "apparently it's not as gnarly as it", "80:54", "sounds", "80:55", "but they go in and drill in this thing", "80:57", "yeah", "80:58", "and open it up that way but but people", "81:01", "who have done this", "81:02", "and they're using this especially for", "81:03", "kids and they're using this for", "81:05", "teenagers", "81:06", "uh repeatedly their allergies go away", "81:10", "they can breathe better they look", "81:11", "totally different because they're", "81:13", "expanding", "81:14", "because growth is centered around this", "81:16", "right here so where are they drilling in", "81:18", "like the upper pallet they drill into", "81:20", "the upper pallet and they put a device", "81:22", "in there", "81:22", "yep so it's permanent so you can't get", "81:24", "it out until they take it out but it's", "81:26", "much quicker this this expansion happens", "81:29", "quickly over the course of a couple of", "81:31", "months oh", "81:32", "so you keep it in your mouth for a", "81:33", "couple months yeah and and your teeth", "81:35", "start widening out", "81:36", "you know and then then they fix it so uh", "81:39", "marianna evans", "81:40", "is an expert at this uh dr william hang", "81:43", "who's right around here", "81:45", "he's been doing this for for 30 years um", "81:48", "very respected uh and he knows this", "81:51", "stuff better than anyone", "81:53", "so yeah and what do they do for your", "81:55", "lower jaw", "81:57", "nothing it's all about this upper palate", "82:00", "on your lower jaw well", "82:01", "they could use they could use braces or", "82:03", "something but but it's all about the the", "82:05", "upper palate", "82:06", "and there are some devices you'd have to", "82:08", "ask hang they they've got all the gizmos", "82:11", "to do", "82:12", "that the reason i thought this was so", "82:14", "interesting that", "82:15", "this was how orthodontist this is how", "82:17", "teeth were straightened right", "82:19", "um a hundred years ago and then by the", "82:21", "40s", "82:22", "they found a way of making dentistry", "82:25", "more more of a production line where", "82:27", "one size fits all we're getting yank", "82:29", "teeth braces on done done", "82:30", "done but but this expansion takes a lot", "82:33", "of expertise and a lot of focus", "82:36", "but what i'm seeing now within that", "82:38", "industry there's this huge moment of", "82:40", "change", "82:40", "where they've they've realized so many", "82:42", "people have realized that", "82:44", "some of these processes might have uh", "82:48", "caused breathing problems and so they're", "82:50", "reassessing how they've been doing", "82:51", "things", "82:52", "and you know one orthodontist told me", "82:54", "he's like we're going to look back in 10", "82:55", "years", "82:56", "and be horrified by by what we've done", "83:00", "but it's it's so interesting to me that", "83:04", "breathing and breath work and and", "83:06", "knowing how to", "83:07", "breathe properly is it's not common", "83:10", "knowledge but it's so", "83:11", "critical to health and it's free it's", "83:14", "not like we're not talking about", "83:15", "something that requires devices", "83:17", "or or like a long learning curve", "83:21", "or just just some of these benefits", "83:25", "so so many of them and especially the", "83:27", "most simple ones", "83:28", "right anyone can breathe in six seconds", "83:31", "in six seconds out", "83:32", "if you want to really go up to the next", "83:34", "stage and figure out what breathing can", "83:36", "really do for you", "83:37", "on a bigger and more powerful level you", "83:40", "can do tumo you can do wim hof you can", "83:42", "do holotropic you can do kriyas you can", "83:44", "do pranayamas", "83:45", "they're all doing the same thing and", "83:47", "holotropic i haven't done it but", "83:49", "it makes you trip right it's an", "83:52", "interesting experience", "83:53", "what was it like for you uh you know", "83:56", "i know a lot of people have found", "83:58", "profound benefits from this", "84:00", "uh they used it um in a hospital", "84:03", "11 000 people were put through this", "84:05", "thing and they showed it was more", "84:07", "effective than", "84:08", "any other therapy me personally that the", "84:11", "science is much more thin", "84:12", "in holotropic breath work and what i had", "84:15", "been told by the", "84:16", "instructors kind of threw me off where", "84:18", "they're like", "84:19", "they sit you in a room and they blast", "84:21", "music and for three hours you breathe as", "84:24", "hard as you can", "84:25", "and they told me that you're going to be", "84:27", "able to enter into this space", "84:29", "because so much oxygen is getting into", "84:31", "your body", "84:32", "the opposite is happening you're", "84:34", "inhibiting blood flow to your brain", "84:37", "and so your brain is processing that as", "84:40", "a", "84:40", "threat and sometimes you inhibit so much", "84:43", "blood flow", "84:44", "that perhaps your brain is interpreting", "84:46", "this as though you are", "84:47", "dying which is why so many people have", "84:50", "this reaction where they said i am", "84:52", "reborn after holotropic", "84:54", "and that's awesome i don't want to take", "84:56", "that away from anyone but", "84:58", "but what i've seen is that this side", "85:01", "there is not", "85:02", "there's been a ton of subjective", "85:04", "anecdotal", "85:05", "studies not a ton a few of them but the", "85:07", "actual science behind it no one's gone", "85:10", "into an fmri", "85:11", "and looked at what's really happening", "85:13", "and that's something i really want to do", "85:15", "and hopefully i'm going to be doing in", "85:16", "the next", "85:17", "next few months just just for curiosity", "85:19", "that makes sense if people are having", "85:21", "psychedelic experiences because many", "85:23", "psychedelic experiences are tied to", "85:25", "near-death experiences a lot of people", "85:26", "that have near-death experiences", "85:28", "they report these moments that", "85:31", "mimic what a lot of people have", "85:33", "experienced on psychedelics", "85:35", "so what they're doing through this", "85:37", "holotropic breathing they're harming", "85:38", "themselves right", "85:39", "or do we not know not not that i know of", "85:42", "um the the doctor who put 11 000 people", "85:45", "and said", "85:46", "nobody had any problems there were no", "85:48", "side effects so i've heard that some", "85:50", "people can", "85:51", "can freak out i heard that there's", "85:53", "possible bowel issues", "85:54", "involved and some some real meltdowns", "85:58", "and in the", "85:58", "class that i took i wasn't sure how much", "86:01", "was psychosomatic", "86:02", "and how much was actually because of the", "86:04", "breathing", "86:05", "i had a pretty strange experience where", "86:08", "a guy turned into a wolf", "86:10", "for a while whoa um and wolf like a real", "86:13", "wolf", "86:13", "went humping around the room oh so a guy", "86:16", "not over to you if i wish if it were a", "86:19", "real wolf have been", "86:21", "incredible but he thought he was a wolf", "86:24", "he", "86:25", "inhabited the body maybe he was just an", "86:27", "asshole", "86:28", "that's possible too and just like acted", "86:31", "out or maybe", "86:32", "he really became a wolf we will never", "86:34", "know which is why this stuff", "86:36", "should be studied you know there's a lot", "86:38", "of talk that breathing this way", "86:40", "will trigger endogenous dmt and that's", "86:43", "the reason people trip out so hard", "86:45", "i tried to do a study in which i would", "86:47", "breathe this way and they would take", "86:48", "blood before and after but", "86:50", "the scientists that i was talking to", "86:52", "said it would be such a small amount", "86:53", "they wouldn't be able to", "86:54", "detect it so there's a lot of gray area", "86:57", "which to me is not a bad thing it's", "86:59", "great there's still mysteries to breath", "87:01", "there's mysteries to the human body", "87:02", "right and if people are finding great", "87:05", "benefit from this and there's no side", "87:07", "effect then", "87:08", "then that's great i just found it was a", "87:10", "little little thinner than the other", "87:12", "techniques", "87:12", "like wim hof method or like crea", "87:16", "no i this guy that had this experience", "87:19", "and he turned into a wolf did you talk", "87:20", "to him before", "87:22", "awesome guy super solid normal he was a", "87:25", "lawyer", "87:26", "working in san francisco and and left", "87:29", "and went to live off the grid in a cabin", "87:31", "in mendocino which is completely", "87:33", "legit and admirable um and he was a he", "87:37", "was a groovy dude", "87:38", "and afterwards really warm welcoming guy", "87:41", "so i don't want to take away", "87:43", "any any process that he went through uh", "87:46", "he said it was very cleansing", "87:48", "for for himself and i think that that's", "87:50", "that's great", "87:51", "you're a very nice guy i wish to rip", "87:55", "to rip on it right yeah i understand i", "87:57", "understand", "87:58", "yeah i'm just saying you're a very nice", "87:59", "guy with your disclaimer", "88:01", "i'd like to talk to him", "88:05", "you know where we can find him he's out", "88:06", "in the tundra right now yeah", "88:08", "you got to go hunt him down is he no i", "88:10", "have no idea", "88:11", "maybe right maybe he's got like a", "88:12", "caribou in his mouth", "88:14", "um could be so this guy ran around did", "88:17", "he have clothes on when he did this", "88:18", "yeah yeah he was uh he was scratching", "88:21", "his crotch a little bit", "88:23", "um and growling and growling and it got", "88:26", "it got interesting yeah everyone saw it", "88:28", "uh", "88:29", "and again you know he was going through", "88:31", "his process that was cool but", "88:33", "the whole time i was watching him", "88:35", "breathing and he wasn't really breathing", "88:37", "any differently", "88:38", "than me because what you do is you have", "88:40", "half the class are the sitters for the", "88:42", "people who are breathing and you watch", "88:43", "over these people in case they have", "88:45", "problems so i was a sitter", "88:47", "during this process i was not breathing", "88:49", "i was looking as respiration really", "88:51", "didn't look any different so i'm", "88:52", "wondering", "88:53", "how much of this is is the set and", "88:54", "setting of this", "88:56", "you're in mendocino you're at a hot", "88:58", "springs", "88:59", "there's really loud music fake loot what", "89:02", "kind of music is this", "89:03", "you know that's that's something i wish", "89:05", "they could have worked on a little bit", "89:06", "death metal", "89:07", "i wish um but it was a lot of like", "89:11", "fake keyboard loots and symbol the fake", "89:14", "tinny symbol crashes", "89:16", "the the macam uh hall", "89:20", "that's the kind of music they're playing", "89:22", "yeah but that would seem like", "89:23", "you know when you talk about set and", "89:24", "setting that would seem to be like a", "89:26", "terrible", "89:27", "sentence setting well a lot of people uh", "89:30", "enjoyed that music and and good good", "89:33", "good for them", "89:34", "it would be interesting to mix it up", "89:35", "with with three hours", "89:37", "of death metal right and just see where", "89:39", "that would take or zeppelin", "89:41", "something good that would be fine yeah", "89:43", "just yeah", "89:44", "um so when you did it so you were a", "89:47", "sitter", "89:48", "but then you also did it right and when", "89:50", "you did it what did you experience", "89:52", "uh well it definitely affects you", "89:54", "because you're breathing in a certain", "89:55", "way it's gonna affect your physiology so", "89:57", "i got really cold i got really hot it", "90:00", "got really spacey", "90:01", "i felt like i was kind of dreaming for a", "90:03", "while three hours", "90:04", "is a long time to breathe as hard as you", "90:07", "possibly can", "90:08", "but the shifts in temperature and in", "90:10", "circulation because the body's trying to", "90:12", "compensate right", "90:13", "so the more you're breathing your ph is", "90:16", "going to be", "90:17", "you know going down so you're becoming", "90:19", "more alkaline", "90:21", "so so your body doesn't like that it", "90:23", "really wants the ph", "90:25", "because all the cellular functions", "90:26", "happen at a certain ph some point four", "90:29", "so it was to me it was fascinating to", "90:31", "feel my body fighting against this", "90:33", "and constantly trying to balance itself", "90:35", "throughout the whole thing", "90:37", "but it it's definitely spacey there's no", "90:39", "doubt about it say spacey would you", "90:42", "uh you are extremely lightheaded you", "90:44", "feel very high", "90:46", "uh i was talking to ben greenfield about", "90:47", "it and he said it was the most profound", "90:49", "spiritual experience he's he's ever had", "90:52", "uh just by breathing and a lot of people", "90:54", "say the same thing", "90:55", "i you know those subjective experiences", "90:57", "are cool", "90:58", "but i think it would be a lot more", "91:00", "interesting to to find out what happens", "91:02", "to", "91:02", "everybody not just one person when they", "91:04", "do this and to look at the brain", "91:06", "and to look at the body and and really", "91:08", "analyze that", "91:09", "to to see if there's some physiological", "91:12", "reaction", "91:12", "we know what's happening with blood flow", "91:14", "to the brain we know what happened to", "91:16", "the brain when it's denied blood", "91:17", "blood flow to certain areas but but how", "91:20", "does that affect us", "91:21", "psychologically afterwards how does it", "91:23", "affect us physically", "91:24", "i think these are good questions and", "91:26", "it'd be interesting to find out how long", "91:28", "did it take you", "91:29", "to feel like you recovered from that", "91:30", "experience uh pretty pretty quickly", "91:33", "um i went outside afterwards and and", "91:35", "drank a beer in my car and just sort of", "91:37", "re-centered um but but it was mostly", "91:40", "just", "91:41", "uh the feeling of extreme", "91:43", "lightheadedness dreaminess", "91:45", "um and then everything just sort of", "91:47", "boils back down and", "91:49", "you're back in mendocino at the hot tubs", "91:51", "you know", "91:53", "and when when they sell you on this like", "91:56",

help", "92:18", "with your asthma they can't say", "92:19", "but but what's interesting is there are", "92:21", "other methods like like kriya", "92:23", "sudarshan korea 60 independent studies", "92:26", "and is so similar to holotropic the", "92:29", "difference is", "92:29", "you don't breathe super hard for three", "92:31", "hours you breathe extremely intensely", "92:34", "for about five minutes then slow it down", "92:36", "but let me ask you about the hall", "92:38", "trouble reading first before creating", "92:39", "sure", "92:40", "so holotropic breathing what is the", "92:42", "actual technique like how does it", "92:43", "how do you do it you breathe as hard and", "92:47", "as fast", "92:48", "as you are so you're not taking big deep", "92:50", "breaths whatever you want to do", "92:52", "whatever you want", "92:56", "you can do that and you're breathing", "92:58", "through the nose", "92:59", "through the mouth whatever you want to", "93:01", "do they say through through the mouth is", "93:03", "going to allow you to get more air in", "93:04", "is that real this was um yeah yeah", "93:06", "you'll get more", "93:08", "yeah larger volume yeah for sure and", "93:10", "this was created", "93:11", "um in the 70s by stanislav graf who is a", "93:14", "psychiatrist", "93:16", "who was one of the first test subjects", "93:18", "of lsd and he started using lsd at johns", "93:21", "hopkins", "93:22", "and in other universities and found it", "93:23", "had this profound effect", "93:25", "for people with with schizophrenia and", "93:27", "other serious problems", "93:28", "it got banned in what 68 and so he", "93:31", "wanted to find a way", "93:32", "to allow people to have these", "93:34", "experiences without the drug", "93:36", "and so he developed this specifically to", "93:38", "mimic the effects of lsd", "93:40", "so and he's he's written 12 books", "93:44", "on this stuff some of the science mostly", "93:46", "the psychology", "93:48", "of what's happening with it uh i wish", "93:50", "that there was some more", "93:51", "hard science to it there's not yet but", "93:54", "hopefully that's forthcoming", "93:55", "in that number three hours is that", "93:57", "consistent they've been it's interesting", "94:00", "when i did this and", "94:01", "this was several years ago it was three", "94:02", "hours so you you had to go three hours", "94:05", "now they're they're doing i guess that", "94:07", "was too hard for a lot of people they're", "94:08", "doing these hour sessions", "94:10", "which is uh which is news to me

"94:29", "um but i guess it's it's pretty hard for", "94:31", "people", "94:32", "to do that for that long i've had some", "94:35", "friends who've done the holotropic", "94:36", "breathing one of the reasons why i asked", "94:37", "you this", "94:38", "and uh these friends are pretty hardcore", "94:41", "psychedelic experimenters and they found", "94:44", "it very profound", "94:45", "and they said that they could achieve", "94:47", "states that are very similar", "94:49", "to uh psychedelic experiences you hear", "94:51", "that all the time", "94:52", "and you didn't find that i i found it", "94:55", "very lightly", "94:57", "i did not go into the the spectral", "94:59", "universe", "95:00", "and you have done that before have you", "95:02", "had psychedelic experiences before", "95:03", "i i have i went to college", "95:06", "um but but i did not you went to college", "95:09", "dabbled too deeply", "95:12", "all these disclaimers my mom's my mom oh", "95:14", "i understand", "95:15", "okay you can wink okay", "95:18", "i got it um now kriya what is the", "95:21", "difference in cream okay", "95:22", "so so crea is uh a", "95:26", "breathing technique that is very similar", "95:28", "to holotropic breath work", "95:30", "but the difference is it's much more", "95:32", "controlled so you're having these", "95:34", "bursts of heavy breathing but then", "95:37", "you have these bursts of very slow", "95:39", "breathing", "95:41", "and this was developed in the 80s and", "95:44", "they started opening up to studies and", "95:46", "there's just as i mentioned there's been", "95:48", "60 independent studies showing how", "95:51", "effective this stuff is for and", "95:53", "that have been done at harvard that have", "95:54", "been done it at legitimate institutions", "95:57", "showing how effective for some", "95:59", "autoimmune diseases for anxiety", "96:01", "for depression for other issues and what", "96:04", "i think is interesting is", "96:05", "so you've got wim hof's breathing which", "96:08", "is very effective for some autoimmune", "96:10", "issues", "96:11", "for some asthma for for anxiety you've", "96:14", "got kriya which is doing the same thing", "96:16", "so what what i found on the book is", "96:18", "people have been coming at this stuff", "96:19", "from different directions", "96:21", "but they're coming to the same", "96:22", "conclusions about these breathing", "96:24", "methods", "96:24", "and these very hard and heavy breathing", "96:26", "methods people think", "96:28", "why do i want to stress myself out so", "96:30", "i'm", "96:31", "stressed out enough with work with my", "96:33", "kids whatever", "96:34", "when i breathe i want to chill out but", "96:36", "that's exactly what these very powerful", "96:38", "breathing methods do", "96:40", "is they focus that stress into one", "96:42", "20-minute", "96:43", "time period so that the rest of the time", "96:46", "you can actually go to sleep so you can", "96:48", "actually be", "96:49", "rested and relaxed and and that's what", "96:51", "what wim hoff's version of", "96:53", "of tumo does and that's what creo does", "96:55", "it all also", "96:56", "uh it stimulates that sympathetic stress", "96:59", "you're completely", "97:01", "really going for it you turn it on", "97:03", "specifically so you can turn it off", "97:06", "so you what is the rhythm in terms of", "97:09", "like", "97:09", "like how hard breathing versus slow", "97:12", "breathing", "97:13", "what is days in in korea it is", "97:16", "a lot of slow breathing at the beginning", "97:21", "and then there's a medium breathing", "97:22", "phase when you say slow breathing like", "97:24", "how much", "97:24", "how much time are the breaths uh", "97:28", "i have not counted i've been following", "97:30", "an instructor but it's", "97:31", "it's usually i'm thinking of because", "97:34", "this", "97:34", "this guy ravi shankar is the one who", "97:37", "dictates this thing so it's only", "97:40", "he's the only guy who doesn't and it", "97:41", "comes so he sends out these cassette", "97:43", "tapes", "97:44", "so quaint or cds people play these so", "97:47", "the slower ones are about", "97:52", "so two three seconds yeah about that um", "97:56", "and then after that or medium so", "98:01", "and then you go for it as hard and as", "98:04", "fast as you can", "98:07", "and did is there any literature on how", "98:09", "they arrived at that specific", "98:11", "rhythm he had been studying he's another", "98:14", "another guy who was spent his lifetime", "98:17", "in meditation", "98:18", "and in yoga and went on his spiritual", "98:21", "enlightenment quest and came out of it", "98:24", "with", "98:25", "this is a breathing technique that i", "98:26", "want to help share with people all of", "98:28", "that sounds really fuzzy", "98:30", "right until you start studying it until", "98:32", "you start doing studies to to", "98:34", "see how people have benefited from this", "98:36", "and that's what i think so", "98:38", "so important no matter how granola it", "98:41", "sounds", "98:41", "if you can measure it you can study it", "98:43", "if you can study it you can find whether", "98:45", "or not it works", "98:46", "and it certainly has worked for so many", "98:48", "people and these studies like what", "98:50", "have they shown in terms of the benefits", "98:52", "like what was the duration that the", "98:53", "people were", "98:54", "doing it for so even after a few weeks", "98:57", "of doing this", "98:58", "that this isn't the only so there's four", "99:01", "different", "99:02", "tangents of this breathing and they say", "99:04", "that you can only really learn it in one", "99:06", "of their schools", "99:07", "um so there's this very soft breathing", "99:09", "where you put your hands like this", "99:12", "then you put your hands like this", "99:13", "underneath your armpits then you put", "99:15", "your hands like this", "99:16", "and you breathe in to a count of four", "99:18", "why do they what is the purpose of it", "99:20", "i think it's to open up i think it's to", "99:21", "open up the lungs", "99:24", "yeah to create flexibility so", "99:27", "it starts with that there's the", "99:28", "obligatory ohms which everyone's doing", "99:31", "nowadays", "99:32", "and uh and then there's that really", "99:33", "intense that cleansing breath at the end", "99:36", "which which to me is", "99:37", "by far the most potent so there's almost", "99:39", "like a warm up", "99:40", "yeah you're getting the and what's the", "99:43", "duration of their", "99:45", "their practice like the the slower", "99:48", "breathing where you", "99:49", "have your hands and your hips um will", "99:51", "probably go on for", "99:52", "about again i haven't timed this because", "99:54", "i've been in a class but probably seven", "99:56", "minutes seven or eight minutes", "99:58", "ohms you do three ohms that's a couple", "100:00", "minutes but", "100:01", "that long cleansing breath is about 40", "100:03", "minutes long", "100:04", "so the whole thing you're done in an", "100:05", "hour yeah", "100:08", "and how many times have you done this", "100:10", "i've probably done it hundreds of times", "100:12", "really yeah and do you get the same sort", "100:14", "of trippy feeling that you got with", "100:15", "holotropic breathing the uh", "100:17", "the body is different every day so it", "100:19", "depends where your mind is depends on", "100:20", "where your body is but but", "100:22", "every single time i i feel very", "100:24", "different at the end i feel much better", "100:27", "clear-headed i'm able to sleep a lot", "100:29", "better so", "100:30", "um you know i've done this in the class", "100:32", "dozens and dozens of times and they had", "100:34", "a youtube uh video", "100:36", "of of this practice that i down now now", "100:39", "it's offline", "100:40", "um so i downloaded that and i'm able to", "100:42", "follow along with that", "100:45", "um so what are you doing currently we", "100:47", "kind of barely touched on it but what do", "100:49", "you what is your daily routine do you", "100:51", "have a daily routine", "100:52", "um my daily routine for the last couple", "100:54", "months has been awful because i've just", "100:56", "been", "100:56", "on book tour you know virtual book tour", "100:59", "and and when", "100:59", "you notice something when you talk for", "101:01", "four or five hours a day", "101:02", "what am i doing now breathing through my", "101:04", "mouth over and over i think that's one", "101:06", "of the reasons", "101:06", "it's it's it's exhausting you know", "101:09", "mentally exhausting physically", "101:10", "exhausting but", "101:11", "uh one thing i try to do is i set up a", "101:14", "little timer there's a zillion different", "101:15", "apps you can do", "101:16", "to focus on those six seconds in six", "101:18", "seconds out breaths", "101:20", "because i noticed the first thing that i", "101:21", "do in the morning i sit down on my", "101:22", "computer", "101:23", "look at you know 40 different emails i", "101:26", "stopped breathing", "101:27", "and i know this because i put on a pulse", "101:29", "ox", "101:30", "and watch my o2 just go straight down", "101:33", "and this is so", "101:34", "they say that up to 80 percent of office", "101:36", "workers have this it's called email", "101:38", "apnea and they've studied it uh", "101:39", "some researchers at the internet apnea", "101:42", "yeah", "101:43", "if you think about it next time you sit", "101:45", "down at a computer you've got", "101:46", "your twitter on you've got your phone", "101:48", "open you just", "101:50", "lose focus on your body you lose focus", "101:52", "on your posture", "101:53", "so you're saying like this which makes", "101:54", "it really hard to take a deep breath", "101:57", "and then you lose focus on on your how", "102:00", "healthily you're breathing", "102:01", "and and so i've found that if i focus on", "102:04", "that", "102:04", "right from the get-go i can sort of set", "102:07", "myself up for some good habits", "102:09", "i also try to incorporate when i'm when", "102:11", "i'm working out i", "102:12", "always nasal breathe and i try to uh", "102:15",
