this were you thinking I", "13:38", "gotta find something else to do yes and", "13:41", "no I knew I wouldn't quit skating", "13:43", "because I just loved it like I never did", "13:45", "it from the money you know I started", "13:46", "there were no no one could be rich or", "13:48", "famous from skating so that was never", "13:49", "the objective it was just because I", "13:52", "loved what it brought to me I love the", "13:53", "self-confidence it brought to me I love", "13:55", "the creativity I love the the misfit", "13:57", "crew the the community of it and so when", "14:01", "things started to go south financially I", "14:04", "know when quit I just had to figure out", "14:07", "how to make ends meet and I actually had", "14:09", "a video editing system and I learned how", "14:11", "to do that very early like right when", "14:13", "nonlinear video started happening I had", "14:15", "a system so I started doing freelance", "14:17", "work for companies doing video editing", "14:20", "super random some skate companies and", "14:22", "then I did exhibitions like we were", "14:27", "doing exhibitions in amusement park", "14:32", "parking lots we weren't even in the", "14:33", "amusement park we're like in the parking", "14:35", "lot as people walk in as entertainment", "14:37", "you know and doing that for like 100", "14:40", "bucks a day but it but it allowed me to", "14:44", "skate and allowed me to pay the rent and", "14:46", "it was like that was good enough for me", "14:48", "but were you thinking that this is gonna", "14:50", "stop totally well it was definitely felt", "14:54", "like I was heading that way but I like I", "14:56", "said I was trying to I was just trying", "14:59", "to do whatever I could so I was trying", "15:00", "to learn different skills and you know", "15:03", "maybe skating wasn't gonna pay the bills", "15:05", "but I couldn't let it go for my life wow", "15:09", "that's a great story it was there and", "15:13", "you brought it back yeah I guess I mean", "15:16", "a lot of ways right it was um it started", "15:19", "slow they come back really when the X", "15:22", "Games came into playing where suddenly", "15:26", "we were we were on TV and kids could see", "15:31", "how much skating had evolved well the", "15:33", "whole public could see how much skating", "15:34", "and evolved from the time", "15:35", "they last saw it in the late 80s and", "15:38", "then they were seeing and it was like", "15:40", "well these guys are this is for real you", "15:43", "know this is it for lack of a better", "15:45", "word this is a sport these guys are", "15:46", "doing acrobatic things and and it takes", "15:49", "discipline and it takes it takes", "15:52", "determination and and kids recognize", "15:54", "that and I think they you know that's", "15:55", "really when skating started to spark", "15:57", "again and there's like 95 ish probably", "15:59", "more closer in 96 97 the first axioms", "16:02", "was a little strange a little scattered", "16:05", "because it was like skateboarding and", "16:07", "bungee jumping and rock climbing and sky", "16:10", "surfing there they were just throwing", "16:13", "everything and then it really rubbed us", "16:16", "the wrong way because suddenly we were", "16:17", "labeled as extreme and it was like what", "16:21", "do you do i skateboard oh you're into", "16:22", "extreme sports no I'd skateboard I don't", "16:25", "know yeah that's a weird category right", "16:28", "that extremes it was just anything yeah", "16:30", "and that was I mean really it was coined", "16:32", "by ESPN so that's why they changed it to", "16:35", "X Games so the first one was extreme", "16:37", "games 95 they changed the X Games in 96", "16:39", "I think they really found their their", "16:43", "niche a few years later when they really", "16:46", "sort of started to weed out all the", "16:47", "random stuff and it was more about", "16:49", "skateboarding BMX motocross like those", "16:55", "became really the highlights and the", "16:57", "reason people are tuning in and then", "16:58", "that's when things really exploded what", "17:00", "were like the early skateboarding events", "17:02", "and X Games like what did you it was it", "17:04", "was street and vert and so vert came", "17:08", "back yeah yeah a lot of it I think it", "17:11", "was really because yes being recognized", "17:13", "that the vert is a spectator sport yeah", "17:16", "I was gonna say for us on the outside we", "17:19", "would watch it to see someone fall", "17:20", "spectacularly sure guys would go you", "17:24", "would hit those ramps and you would", "17:26", "watch people just fuck up and you're", "17:29", "like oh my God look how far he's falling", "17:31", "right yeah for sure and then once they", "17:35", "got in you know once they evolved that", "17:36", "into what they call the big air ramps", "17:38", "the mega ramps then it was just like the", "17:41", "the aerials and the risk factor was", "17:43", "tenfold yeah the the risk factor I mean", "17:46", "I I've seen some wipeouts that are", "17:48", "I they're baffling I think when when", "17:53", "things started to really explode with", "17:55", "that with the big air thing and then", "17:57", "Jake Brown had his big accident the one", "17:58", "that kind of everyone

a", "27:58", "statistically at least San Diego seems", "28:00", "to have taken it much better than Los", "28:02", "Angeles did in terms of like fatalities", "28:05", "and one of the superintendent's was a", "28:08", "supervisor or superintendent said that", "28:10", "there's only six deaths that can be", "28:12", "directly attributed to nothing but", "28:14", "coronavirus then everything else had", "28:16", "people with underlying causes which is", "28:18", "pretty extraordinary", "28:21", "yeah I mean yeah so hard to know what to", "28:26", "believe - that's a problem right yeah", "28:28", "yeah that's the problem when like San", "28:31", "Diego is a really healthy place like", "28:33", "every time I'm down there like Pacific", "28:35", "Beach way like people are always running", "28:37", "and biking it's like yeah it's special", "28:39", "County doors II yeah I would imagine", "28:41", "just that alone would lend itself to", "28:43", "people having stronger immune systems I", "28:45", "would hope so but like I said it still", "28:49", "it still feels like a great divide even", "28:51", "there really yeah where people you know", "28:54", "when they", "28:56", "opened the beaches and then there was", "28:59", "only one beach in our area open and it", "29:02", "was like spring break just nuts yeah and", "29:05", "then you know people are frustrated with", "29:07", "each other what are you doing put", "29:10", "everyone at risk and it just it was a", "29:11", "mess nothing like all right but now it's", "29:13", "closed down for good and then everyone", "29:14", "just goes up to Newport or wherever they", "29:17", "can and then got more crowded there and", "29:20", "it's just it was it was a mess", "29:21", "well their own ideas are pretty open now", "29:23", "right isn't that the new thing you can", "29:25", "go surfing but you can't park on the", "29:27", "beach", "29:27", "um that's so stupid which is which is", "29:30", "very challenging but hey at least we're", "29:34", "surfing but that's so dumb why can't you", "29:36", "park there if you're like what's", "29:37", "happening to people when they park it's", "29:39", "like some of these rules are so", "29:40", "arbitrary yeah and like and you never", "29:44", "know what you know what is the rule now", "29:47", "changes day by day but it does feel like", "29:50", "there's definitely a slow opening", "29:53", "happening yeah so when we're talking", "29:56", "about San Diego being like very fit", "29:58", "place do you do any sort of strength and", "30:00", "conditioning or anything for", "30:01", "skateboarding is that something that", "30:03", "people do some people do it I never", "30:06", "found it to help my skating and I always", "30:10", "felt like skating kept me fit so I never", "30:13", "really did it I mean outside of swimming", "30:16", "and surfing which is more of her body", "30:18", "than skating obviously but um but I do", "30:22", "feel like that would have benefited me", "30:24", "later in life I just got stuck in my", "30:26", "mode and then just skating was you stay", "30:29", "there you're in your mode now you don't", "30:31", "do anything I don't do anything else I", "30:33", "do I do make an effort to like swim some", "30:35", "laps because my mom lived till her 90s", "30:39", "and she swore by swimming amazing yeah", "30:42", "yeah she would go you know through I", "30:45", "mean I remember all as a kid she would", "30:47", "definitely she had to get her twenty", "30:49", "laps in every day and and we we are are", "30:55", "where I live the residential area had a", "30:57", "community swimming pool that was like", "30:59", "Olympic sized so yeah we were talking", "31:02", "before about surfing and I was saying", "31:05", "that I think that surfing at least", "31:07", "partially would", "31:08", "kind of mimic some of the muscles that", "31:10", "you use in skateboarding and then you're", "31:12", "telling me about getting towed in by", "31:14", "Laird and rink his coffee Wow yes so", "31:22", "well my brother my older brother was a", "31:24", "surfer and he got me into skating", "31:27", "because he skated in the 70s when that", "31:29", "was the thing was they were trying to", "31:31", "emulate surfing with the skateboards and", "31:33", "so he actually gave me one of his old", "31:35", "boards that was my first skateboard and", "31:37", "then he would drive me to the skate park", "31:39", "once a week like come home from college", "31:40", "and take me to the park and then I just", "31:42", "got hooked like that was that was my", "31:44", "home away from home", "31:44", "from that point on and so I surf pretty", "31:50", "regularly I would say less now but but", "31:53", "it was hard not to with my brother's", "31:56", "influence and we were in Hawaii", "31:58", "my brother he actually used to be the", "32:00", "editor of Surfer magazine so he knows", "32:02", "all because he's journalists really good", "32:06", "writer teaches at Stanford now actually", "32:09", "and so we went to why we went to Maui", "32:14", "and he said hey Laird said he'd take us", "32:16", "out tow-in surfing if you want to go", "32:18", "we're gonna go tones were with Laird", "32:20", "Hamilton like that I don't think his", "32:24", "level of what is mellow is something", "32:26", "that is what we would consider and he's", "32:29", "and I go but you know we got to go like", "32:31", "it's once-in-a-lifetime right so they", "32:33", "took us out to Spreckels which is near", "32:35", "Jaws which is there a big spot this is", "32:37", "like early 2000s so toen serving was", "32:41", "just starting to come into play I'll", "32:43", "never forget Dave Kalama who's one of", "32:45", "the surfers one of his homies he was", "32:47", "trying out the first foil board there oh", "32:49", "wow and he had he was wearing ski boots", "32:54", "attached to the foil board that's how he", "32:57", "was riding it I was like these guys are", "32:59", "out of their minds and and so detached", "33:04", "like a ski boot if you fall I never saw", "33:06", "a detach he's God yeah so you have to", "33:11", "recover and and swim to the surface", "33:13", "while you're permanently student focused", "33:15", "on trying to survive myself to worry", "33:17", "about what he was doing", "33:19", "but yeah so rush Randall has another", "33:23", "windsurfer there he was towing me and", "33:26", "Laird is towing my brother and I'll", "33:29", "never forget them being outside and then", "33:31", "you know they're saying it's a small day", "33:33", "and they're like oh I think there might", "33:34", "be like it some 10 or 12 foot sets and I", "33:37", "know what 10 or 12 foot in Hawaiian", "33:39", "measurement means that was like kid just", "33:42", "don't tell me into one of those okay and", "33:44", "and then I'll never forget looking out", "33:47", "and and rush said here comes one like", "33:49", "where where cuz you're so far out right", "33:52", "he's like get ready okay and so then I", "33:55", "got ready and I'm getting towed and all", "33:57", "of a sudden this this thing this", "33:58", "mountain just swells up underneath me", "34:00", "and before I know it I'm just in the pit", "34:02", "of this move this way there was like", "34:05", "double overhead biggest way I've ever", "34:06", "ridden for sure and for me its backside", "34:10", "so when you're going backside you're", "34:12", "just sort of looking down the line", "34:13", "you're not looking back at the at the", "34:15", "barrel what does that mean by backside", "34:17", "so the wave is breaking this way and my", "34:20", "back went over my back is to the face of", "34:22", "the wave oh okay right and it back sides", "34:26", "a little more challenging just because", "34:28", "the turning and and the way you're", "34:30", "facing mmm so when you go in front side", "34:32", "you're facing the wave you can really", "34:33", "see down the line you can come back", "34:35", "easily so I'm going back side and I", "34:38", "remembered looking at looking at the", "34:39", "wall thinking like I've ridden 20 foot", "34:42", "skate ramps and I'm like that's that", "34:43", "looks like about a 20 foot skate ramp so", "34:46", "I was going and I was cruising and then", "34:47", "I did a little cutback so I started", "34:50", "going to back towards the barrel and I", "34:53", "looked at the barrel and it was like the", "34:55", "most frightening thing I've ever seen in", "34:56", "my life because it was you know it was", "34:58", "like a massive hollow wave that you see", "35:02", "in movies that you see lair just dancing", "35:05", "around in and I'm like I can't I'm not", "35:07", "getting near that thing", "35:08", "immediately just turned back and went", "35:10", "down alive even further just get ahead", "35:12", "of it and then I did find myself after a", "35:16", "few waves getting cocky and I tried to", "35:17", "pull into the barrel and it just", "35:20", "clobbered me in the head and then I you", "35:22", "know you wearing a life vest and then I", "35:24", "went down I'll never forget like I felt", "35:26", "myself going down one shelf and you know", "35:29", "trying to swim up to the top and then I", "35:31", "fell to go down another", "35:32", "shelf and I was like oh this is bad and", "35:35", "then finally made it up to the surface", "35:36", "and Russia's like three feet from me Wow", "35:39", "because he's just been chasing those", "35:41", "guys are

my", "40:40", "drive just to come up with new tricks", "40:42", "like I knew the first time I ever did a", "40:44", "trick like a new trick and one that", "40:48", "hadn't been done before the buzz that I", "40:50", "got from it was what I've been so what", "40:52", "I've been chasing my whole life you know", "40:55", "the idea that I created something new", "40:57", "like just on my own with my own thoughts", "41:00", "and and creativity and that like I did", "41:05", "it my own way and you know skateboarding", "41:08", "was like that it was like this art form", "41:09", "to me where you there's this blank", "41:11", "canvas and it's just like go make it", "41:13", "your own", "41:13", "oh that's an interesting way to look at", "41:15", "it I never thought of it that way yeah I", "41:18", "mean it really is cool to look at so it", "41:20", "is an art form sure it's like you could", "41:25", "show me a picture of two people doing", "41:27", "the same trick silhouette it and I could", "41:29", "tell you who it is oh you know what I", "41:31", "mean because everyone has their own", "41:33", "style and they put their own flavor on", "41:35", "it and and that's what I love like I", "41:36", "love that it's it's subjective like that", "41:38", "you know people think of it like they", "41:40", "don't like skaters themselves especially", "41:42", "the more hardcore purists don't like to", "41:45", "be called a sport they're like we're not", "41:47", "a sport like well there's legitimate", "41:49", "competitions so yeah and there is", "41:52", "sporting element to it but I agree it is", "41:54", "more of an art form and a lifestyle", "41:56", "because how can you you're comparing", "41:58", "apples to oranges always that's real", "42:00", "similar in a lot of ways to martial arts", "42:02", "in that like if I saw silhouette of", "42:04", "certain people I'd say oh that's you", "42:07", "know that's John Jones or that's John", "42:08", "Parr like you could tell by the way", "42:10", "someone move", "42:11", "like right away yeah just because you're", "42:13", "gonna put your stamp on it yeah and", "42:14", "that's what I love about it because it's", "42:16", "so diverse yeah when you come up with a", "42:18", "move like what's your process you just", "42:20", "skate fuck around have some fun and then", "42:22", "go just try this it's always different a", "42:26", "lot of times it's like how do we combine", "42:28", "how can I combine these two things that", "42:30", "I know I have dialed in like can I make", "42:33", "them work together sometimes it's a", "42:36", "happy accident like you go try something", "42:38", "your board spins the other way and it's", "42:39", "like well wait if I caught it there that", "42:42", "would have worked out mmm like yes sir I", "42:45", "literally created a new trick yesterday", "42:47", "yesterday yeah because we are doing this", "42:50", "when will this air tomorrow tomorrow", "42:53", "what we're doing up we're doing sort of", "42:55", "a we call it an NBD best trick event and", "42:58", "my ramp", "42:59", "NBD me has never been done and so my", "43:04", "idea was that and this is all this law", "43:06", "come out but my idea was that while", "43:08", "we're all stuck you know doing this", "43:11", "social distancing and whatnot let's do a", "43:13", "best trick event where everyone gets one", "43:14", "hour on my ramp all the best vert", "43:17", "skaters so you get one hour to do it you", "43:19", "get a check on video so it's literally", "43:21", "just one dude and or one one skater and", "43:23", "one filmer at the ramp at a time and I", "43:27", "was the guinea pig so yesterday morning", "43:29", "was like alright you're the first hour", "43:31", "go and and I had to come up with this", "43:34", "trick and I started trying one that I", "43:35", "had been working on and it just kept", "43:38", "slipping away like getting worse every", "43:40", "attempt and so I went I went and sort of", "43:42", "switched gears into a trick that I had", "43:44", "tried a couple months ago and was like", "43:46", "if you're ever gonna make this happen", "43:48", "this is it and finally one just clicked", "43:52", "and I made it and it was just like it", "43:54", "was it was the combination of two tricks", "43:55", "that I have pretty dialed but putting", "43:57", "them together added this element of just", "44:03", "so much to miss hmm like they all you", "44:07", "know everything had to come together at", "44:08", "the exact moment and land on my feet", "44:10", "on the coping in the right position and", "44:12", "and I knew if I got it once I'd make it", "44:16", "but like I'm never gonna do that trick", "44:17", "again that's how technical it is oh wow", "44:19", "where I just know that okay I got that", "44:22", "one done it got it on video I don't want", "44:24", "to go through that again", "44:25", "now how much I don't know shit about", "44:28", "skating so I like forgive me if there's", "44:31", "an ignorant question but how much", "44:33", "improvement has there been in the wheels", "44:36", "in the boards in the components and all", "44:39", "and all the different things like are", "44:41", "there things you can do now today they", "44:42", "just really weren't possible when you", "44:44", "first started skating only in the well", "44:47", "when I first started skating skateboards", "44:49", "were all over the place so they were", "44:51", "made of different materials they were", "44:52", "different with like all different shapes", "44:54", "they you know the urethane had just come", "44:57", "into play but I would say for the last", "45:00", "30 years it's pretty much the same", "45:02", "construction mmm", "45:03", "seven plywood maple skateboards trucks", "45:08", "have not changed wheels have changed in", "45:11", "size and hardness but it's still the", "45:14", "same urethane for the most part so there", "45:16", "hasn't been a lot of huge advancements", "45:18", "the bigger that the big changes are the", "45:20", "shapes of the boards now why have they", "45:22", "stuck with plywood", "45:24", "what about like carbon fiber you know", "45:26", "attic that is that's the big question", "45:29", "and and something that I would like to", "45:31", "pursue but we really need a sea change", "45:34", "in skateboarding with materials I", "45:36", "believe that yeah and we've we haven't", "45:39", "found anything that that responds the", "45:44", "same hmm", "45:46", "or you know it the other thing is", "45:48", "skaters as much as they are very", "45:52", "progressive and you know they like to be", "45:55", "do different things and and go it's", "45:58", "think outside the box and whatnot if you", "45:59", "try to sell them a deck that's you know", "46:02", "200 bucks that's how that's gonna be", "46:05", "hard hmm", "46:06", "even if you can convince them that it's", "46:08", "gonna last three times long four times", "46:10", "long so is it just a money thing or they", "46:12", "just haven't really felt like there's", "46:14", "some some people have done different", "46:17", "construction where they add a different", "46:18", "ply in and that has worked a little bit", "46:21", "but the I like I said there just hasn't", "46:26", "been that that one seed planted where", "46:29", "it's like all right this is it this", "46:31", "would imagine carbon fiber", "46:32", "I tried something along those lines and", "46:37", "it just like I said it didn't have that", "46:40", "reflux mmm does it have to have a", "46:42", "certain amount of weight to it to", "46:43", "because that that well that's the other", "46:45", "thing we're kind of stuck where this is", "46:47", "this is how skateboard should weigh", "46:49", "right and so if you bring in something", "46:51", "is way lighter maybe that's not the", "46:54", "answer", "46:54", "hmm but we don't know it just you know", "46:57", "it takes R&D for sure and you would have", "46:59", "to get someone really good to fuck with", "47:01", "it too right yeah and to believe in it", "47:04", "and yeah get behind it yep when I was a", "47:07", "kid there was no 50 year old rock stars", "47:09", "you know yes rock stars as they were in", "47:14", "their 20s and 30s and then they just", "47:17", "kind of like we thought they faded away", "47:19", "like the Beach Boys everybody felt sad", "47:21", "about the Beach Boys Noize yeah but not", "47:24", "anymore you know now Mick Jagger is like", "47:26", "fucking almost 80 years old and he's", "47:28", "rocking after heart surgery and shit and", "47:31", "the same is kind of true with skaters", "47:34", "right because when when we were kids", "47:36", "when you became famous you won't you", "47:39", "were like the first wave right or one of", "47:42", "the first waves and certainly the most", "47:44", "famous you are 52 and you're still", "47:48", "considering is that a weird thing that", "47:51", "you're it is weird it's it's well it's", "47:54", "fun right you can still do it and then", "47:57", "you're still you know I mean you're also", "48:00", "it's not like you're a dinosaur you're", "48:02", "accepted like you're you're a skater", "48:05", "it's like just you just happen to be 52", "48:07", "I mean yeah it well it went through the", "48:10", "years so when I first started skating", "48:12", "the the sort of unspoken rule was once", "48:15", "you're at an age of responsibility", "48:17", "you're 18 you got a good job hmm you", "48:20", "can't skate for a living no one can so", "48:22", "you know your skating career is over by", "48:25", "then and then as I turn 18 things", "48:28", "started to sort of ramp up with skating", "48:31", "forgive the pun but and things started", "48:34", "to kind of explode and I remember around", "48:36", "that time there was a photo and Thrasher", "48:38", "of this guy mark Lake was an older", "48:40", "skater at the time and he was picture", "48:42", "him doing one of those handplant like", "48:45", "upside down on a ramp and", "48:46", "was like mark lake 30 and still going", "48:48", "for it and I remember I was like in my", "48:51", "early 20s thinking that's crazy", "48:54", "he's 30 right and then as things", "48:58", "progress like we realized that that", "49:01", "we're all sort of if we're if we're able", "49:03", "to do this for a living and we can", "49:05", "really pursue it and we have support we", "49:07", "are were getting better into our 30s I", "49:10", "mean I you know when I did a 900 the", "49:12", "x-games I was 31 Wow and so then it was", "49:17", "just like well what is the limit I don't", "49:19", "know I'm I guess I'm sort of the guinea", "49:22", "pig now are leading the charge of what", "49:24", "how far you can take it and I've", "49:25", "definitely started I've refined my style", "49:28", "so I'm not doing big impact stuff I'm", "49:31", "not doing the the more you know the big", "49:33", "spins the big airs and stuff I've", "49:35", "learned to get more technical with my", "49:37", "skating and that has allowed me to stay", "49:39", "creative but maintain my health yeah", "49:43", "that's why I was asking about strength", "49:44", "and conditioning because if you're an", "49:46", "older athlete it's it's a mandatory", "49:48", "thing in almost every sport yeah it's", "49:51", "just I skate for a couple hours a day", "49:54", "I'd say four times a week and that's", "49:58", "pretty much my exercise but definitely I", "50:02", "could use some help with endurance these", "50:04", "days have you thought about doing", "50:05", "something like what would you do uh I", "50:08", "don't know I guess I would listen to the", "50:10", "experts I would tap you but you haven't", "50:14", "done anything yeah which is amazing I", "50:16", "haven't yeah but like I said it's just", "50:17", "because that's worked

to call me over there", "50:40", "mm-hmm when I go to turn to look at them", "50:42", "they'll definitely say like what's wrong", "50:44", "with your neck Wow that happens to me", "50:45", "every day

"afterward okay I done here it's I swear", "51:44", "by the thing it's it's the bet and it's", "51:46", "it's all so it doesn't fuck with your", "51:47", "neck in a way that's unnatural in terms", "51:50", "of putting weight on your head and", "51:52", "flexing right your your discs it", "51:55", "actually keeps your neck stiff as well", "51:57", "as you know when you're when you're", "51:59",

"76:25", "crowd I don't know what motivations any", "76:27", "different it might be a little bit less", "76:31", "stressful slightly obviously it's a", "76:33", "fucking cage fright it's gonna be", "76:34", "stressful but maybe a little less", "76:36", "stressful because you don't get the roar", "76:38", "of the crowd it's not the energy in the", "76:40", "place maybe you could focus a little bit", "76:42", "better but you know there in the UFC so", "76:45", "they're fighting the best fighters in", "76:47", "the world so that's no matter what", "76:49", "certain mindset you're getting into you", "76:50", "regard yeah but it was just interesting", "76:52", "because they could clearly hear their", "76:54", "corner so when their corners were", "76:55", "yelling out instruction and when the", "76:57", "opposition corner was yelling it alright", "76:59", "yeah they could he'll hear all that and", "77:01", "we could hear that too like crystal", "77:03", "clear not a sound in the room

strange you know", "77:15", "wow are they gonna have skating", "77:17", "competitions with no audience as well", "77:20", "that remains to be seen I assume that's", "77:23", "probably where it's gonna go", "77:25", "I'm not part of the whole Olympic", "77:28", "qualifying thing going on so I don't", "77:31", "know what they're going to do or how", "77:33", "they're gonna continue to qualify people", "77:35", "going into next year yeah we had an", "77:38", "event", "77:38", "and that was supposed to happen in June", "77:41", "in Salt Lake City", "77:43", "big verts cake on test and it has

will", "78:04", "decide if it happens or not but I hope", "78:07", "that we can get it done with the", "78:10", "necessary guidelines and whatnot because", "78:12", "I do feel like um our our type of", "78:15", "skating which is the vert skating is", "78:16", "sort of a lost art that's not going to", "78:18", "be in the Olympics by the way so the", "78:20", "what is this the first year that skating", "78:22", "is gonna be yes yep yeah well next year", "78:25", "but yes sir is it twenty twenty-one", "78:27", "twenty twenty-one yeah interesting", "78:28", "so skateboarding the disciplines are", "78:31", "Street which is sort of the handrails", "78:34", "and stare as ledges of stuff like that", "78:35", "you see and then what they call Park and", "78:38", "park is sort of a mishmash of pool", "78:41", "skating but also some other skatepark", "78:44", "elements like banks and and curves and", "78:47", "things like that so it's more because", "78:50", "that type of skating is more accessible", "78:52", "especially internationally then what we", "78:55", "call vert skating but it's kind of a to", "78:59", "me it's a disservice to skating because", "79:02", "vert skating like you said it's the", "79:05", "thing you can understand if you're not a", "79:07", "skater people are flying around they're", "79:09", "doing gymnastics they're doing", "79:10", "somersaults there you know and and that", "79:12", "type of stuff you see a very muted", "79:15", "version of that in Park skating hmm and", "79:18", "why do they fix choose those events I", "79:21", "think that's it because the", "79:22", "accessibility and I have to I have to", "79:24", "respect that that's just nice thread", "79:26", "since you know there's a there's like a", "79:28", "strong skate not I mean there is a skate", "79:30", "scene in places like Ethiopia and", "79:33", "Ethiopia has parks they don't have vert", "79:36", "ramps obviously so I understand on that", "79:40", "level you're gonna have a much more", "79:42", "well-rounded competitive field that's", "79:46", "cool that Ethiopia is embraced Gate", "79:49", "boarding I see that yeah", "79:52", "you've been there yeah see here it is", "79:54", "Jamie's already got it the best in the", "79:56", "business young Jamie look at this wow", "79:59", "that's fucking cool", "80:01", "wow that's not what I picture when I", "80:03", "think of Ethiopia right I mean that", "80:04", "looks like that could be Atlanta that", "80:06", "could be anywhere yeah absolutely I mean", "80:09", "that kind of thing is happening all over", "80:12", "the world mmm", "80:14", "there's there's a I don't know if you've", "80:16", "heard of SCADA Stan but SCADA stan is a", "80:18", "skate for lack of a better word camp", "80:22", "facility and educational facility in", "80:26", "Afghanistan in Kabul and they teach", "80:29", "girls they teach girls they give them", "80:32", "education and they learn how to skate", "80:34", "whoa in fact there was a documentary on", "80:37", "them the won an Academy Award at the", "80:41", "last Oscars really yeah do you get", "80:45", "anything on that that was that was my in", "80:47", "for what's called learning to skate", "80:49", "that's skater Stan it's called learning", "80:52", "to skate in a war zone if you're a girl", "80:55", "that's the name of the documentary", "80:56", "that's got to be very dangerous for them", "80:58", "though right because the fundamentalists", "81:00", "don't want them doing well so that's the", "81:02", "thing is is that they they see it the", "81:04", "culture sees skateboards as a toy not a", "81:07", "sport and allows girls to do it oh wow", "81:11", "so they don't they don't see it as this", "81:13", "co-ed sport at all and so it's really", "81:15", "interesting that the ratio of boys to", "81:19", "girls are equal skating in Afghanistan", "81:23", "and same goes for they have another", "81:24", "program in Cambodia and they have one in", "81:26", "South Africa I've been to all of them", "81:27", "are not a couple but look at that I'm", "81:29", "sure that is so wild the mountains of", "81:32", "Afghanistan the background oh yeah girls", "81:33", "catching there are there programs in say", "81:35", "they're there they're one of the best", "81:38", "wow that's wild", "81:42", "that's crazy as skating is that's crazy", "81:45", "that during your lifetime skating has", "81:47", "just blossomed and gone from this sort", "81:49", "of misfit thing to something that's in", "81:51", "the Olympics in an Ethiopia Afghanistan", "81:53", "all over the world that's why it is wild", "81:56", "yeah it's really every day is like a new", "81:59", "surprise", "82:00", "now when they do it in the Olympics what", "82:02", "is the scoring criteria like how do they", "82:04", "how do they judge", "82:06", "um I well I don't think they're gonna", "82:08", "reinvent the wheel in terms of how they", "82:11", "judge I think that they have to be very", "82:13", "concise with their criteria now in terms", "82:16", "of writing it down because before it was", "82:18", "just sort of loose and that guy you know", "82:21", "that skater ripped and went higher and", "82:23", "looked cooler and we gave him first and", "82:26", "now it's got to be much more but but", "82:29", "it's more it's more about technical", "82:33", "aspects like how the difficulty factor", "82:36", "how you flow like how you link tricks", "82:39", "together how much speed you have how", "82:42", "high you go I mean all those factors but", "82:44", "at the end of the day when you go to the", "82:47", "skate contests you can tell the the top", "82:50", "skaters it's it's just obvious that they", "82:53", "they were ripping they used the course", "82:56", "better you know they went higher they", "83:00", "spun more they flip their board hard in", "83:02", "in more difficult ways and they're the", "83:05", "winners and now do you have former pros", "83:08", "or current pros the judges I'm not", "83:11", "really sure who how they're picking", "83:13", "judges I'm not like I said yeah a", "83:15", "standard competition a lot of them racks", "83:18", "pros yeah and so there's pretty like", "83:22", "universal acceptance of like what what's", "83:25", "good and what's bad yeah it's always up", "83:28", "for debate", "83:28", "yeah who should have won that event or", "83:32", "this or how to manage their at the level", "83:34", "that these guys around it's probably", "83:35", "quite a few guys that are comparable", "83:37", "right sure yeah so it's basically how", "83:40", "good your run was how good your run was", "83:42", "yeah and and who had a better day", "83:44", "similar to surfing in that regard", "83:46", "absolutely yeah yeah yep so that's", "83:48", "what's interesting for someone like me", "83:50", "watching like I'm not exactly sure what", "83:52", "I'm seeing I know what looks cool but I", "83:54", "don't know what what what one you know", "83:57", "sure yeah and I and I think that well I", "84:01", "I'm hoping that that will be my job to", "84:04", "explain to the audience I I was supposed", "84:08", "to be there in Tokyo", "84:09", "doing some commentary not not ville", "84:11", "play-by-play but more sort of you know", "84:14", "coming in and out of there and doing", "84:16", "whatever shows they need me to do but", "84:19", "so I would like to loan the Olympics for", "84:20", "a year or a year yeah mm-hmm hmm so you", "84:24", "would like to I would like to be there", "84:26", "to try to to try to bridge that gap", "84:29", "right of the the non skating viewer who", "84:33", "is interested and explained to them why", "84:35", "you know why this this nuance is gonna", "84:39", "score way higher than this other but", "84:40", "even though they look the same to you", "84:42", "yeah and I've done it I've done like", "84:46", "they had the van's Park series all last", "84:48", "year where we went to all over the world", "84:51", "went to China Brazil Canada France and", "84:55", "they built these parks that they left", "84:58", "there but I was doing all the the", "85:01", "commentary for the events and that was", "85:03", "kind of where that's where my strengths", "85:06", "are is is being able to explain those", "85:08", "things to non skaters well that's gotta", "85:11", "be fun for you too because it's an", "85:12", "opportunity to sort of you know", "85:15", "proselytize let everybody know like like", "85:18", "show them how cool this is yeah yeah", "85:21", "words to your passion this thing and I", "85:24", "mean that's got a really spark up the", "85:26", "interests of new skaters I think that's", "85:29", "the silver lining with the Olympics I", "85:31", "mean there there is a lot of controversy", "85:33", "in the hardcore skate scene where it's", "85:34", "just like we're not we don't blowing", "85:36", "lumic we've always done this to be anti", "85:37", "that type of thing anyway yeah and and", "85:40", "then it's just like well you guys all of", "85:42", "those things you love ice skating will", "85:44", "still exist right you can still go hop", "85:46", "fences and ski the hint we're like", "85:47", "that's not taken away from you if", "85:49", "anything it's going to bring it to a", "85:52", "bigger audience that that is going to be", "85:54", "interested yeah and I believe a more", "85:57", "international audience I think that's", "85:59", "the really cool part about it that's a", "86:00", "thing though man when people when things", "86:02", "start going mainstream people always", "86:05", "panic right but that's the other thing", "86:07", "is this like if you think that the", "86:10", "competition element is what is somehow", "86:12", "sanitizing skating whe that I grew up", "86:16", "skating competitions I literally enter", "86:18", "my first contest at age 10 that is the", "86:21", "only way you got recognized when I was a", "86:22", "kid like the way this is not something", "86:25", "new to skateboarding it's just that now", "86:27", "there are different opportunities in", "86:29", "skating and there is a way to make a", "86:30", "living even if you don't compete", "86:32", "and so because that exists people are", "86:35", "just like Olympics are a comment you", "86:37", "know if that's a sport competition like", "86:39", "yeah but we already have Street League", "86:42", "we already have the do too or we already", "86:43", "have X Games those things all exist so", "86:46", "we're gonna have this other big event", "86:47", "once every four years and people always", "86:50", "want to shit on something that's", "86:51", "different than what they're doing though", "86:52", "oh sure it seems like I mean had I've", "86:56", "lived with so much ridicule my whole", "86:59", "life that I just think it's like yeah", "87:01", "sure whatever you say well for you I", "87:03", "mean you've crossed over to the other", "87:05", "side that's what's interesting I mean", "87:07", "you don't even need a thick skin anymore", "87:09", "yeah I mean there's obviously still", "87:12", "haters like you're a sellout and whatnot", "87:16", "but it's like do you read those comments", "87:18", "I just don't wither or anything dear III", "87:21", "like I if someone's making enough noise", "87:23", "I'll see it and you know everyone some", "87:26", "well I like to see what the what the", "87:27", "general vibe is on something but when I", "87:30", "grew up like I think my journey allowed", "87:33", "me to really be prepared for that", "87:35", "because when I was a kid I was doing", "87:38", "this outcast activity right so I was", "87:40", "already not cool in school and then I", "87:43", "started skating and I was like a scrawny", "87:45", "little kid with a really sort of what", "87:48", "they call robotic style because I was", "87:50", "focusing on tricks so I was getting made", "87:52", "fun of in the skate world so I was like", "87:55", "an outcast in this outcast activity and", "87:57", "it was really isolating and at some", "88:00", "point I was like I love this too much to", "88:01", "listen to these people and not do it", "88:03", "look explain to me what you were getting", "88:05", "shit on for like you had a robotic style", "88:08", "so basically what in when I first", "88:11", "started getting into skating especially", "88:12", "pool skating to be a pool skater you had", "88:15", "to be super cool look like you're", "88:18", "surfing it was all about your style", "88:20", "right and it was all about like how you", "88:21", "flow and if you're doing aerials it's", "88:23", "got to look cool and and I was super", "88:26", "scrawny super short kid and so all I", "88:29", "really knew how to do was to maneuver my", "88:31", "board and so I was doing these tricks", "88:32", "where I'd like spin my board under my", "88:34", "feet and do these weird sort of hand", "88:37", "plants and aerial tricks and things", "88:40", "where it just wasn't that wasn't the", "88:42", "normal and it wasn't really considered", "88:44", "the", "88:45", "way to skate and so they just they were", "88:48", "like there's they call me a circus", "88:50", "circus skater you're like oh there's", "88:53", "Tony with the circus tricks oh wow", "88:55", "and then it's someone I just like I", "88:57", "loved what I was doing and I didn't", "88:59", "really listen it and then I got I got", "89:01", "more confident and I got stronger and", "89:02", "then I started doing this stuff like way", "89:04", "up high in the air and then it was sort", "89:06", "of undeniable that it was like oh well", "89:07", "that is something so was there pressure", "89:11", "for you to change your style and sort of", "89:13", "blend it I just didn't have I didn't", "89:17", "have the the bulk to be able to do it", "89:19", "anyway so I didn't ball yeah like I just", "89:23", "didn't have that weight behind me and so", "89:24", "what I did was when back then in order", "89:28", "to do aerials out of pool as you had to", "89:30", "like reach down grab your board and sort", "89:32", "of muscle it into the air and above the", "89:34", "coping and I learned how to launch into", "89:37", "the air without grabbing my board and", "89:39", "then grabbing it at the peak and that", "89:41", "allowed me to get the height when I was", "89:44", "still really scrawny and weak and they", "89:47", "said that technique was cheating like", "89:50", "they literally wrote that and Thrasher", "89:51", "Magazine it's like well Tony Hawk cheats", "89:53", "because he always into his air isn't", "89:55", "that way he can just grab it

old guard", "90:19", "in skating and they just didn't like to", "90:21", "see anything new or or sort of fringe", "90:25", "and then I started doing that and then", "90:27", "and then a lot of my peers who were my", "90:29", "age they all figured that same technique", "90:31", "out and then we just kind of took over", "90:34", "you know that became the way to skate", "90:36", "and but but then through the years like", "90:40", "in those days you know skating was still", "90:43", "very much a novelty and then in the 90s", "90:46", "like X Games came into play and then all", "90:48", "of a
