all", "05:30", "the time I'll give you some examples", "05:33", "that first time I noticed it was the", "05:36", "very first debate when megyn kelly was", "05:39", "asking him the question about the", "05:41", "insults he had allegedly said to women", "05:43", "not allegedly he said them and this is a", "05:47", "setup that any other politician with his", "05:50", "setup is totally trapped because they", "05:52", "can either try to like deny they said it", "05:54", "and then somebody has a videotape and", "05:56", "that doesn't work or they can say oh I", "05:58", "didn't mean it there's almost nothing", "06:00", "you can say you're just trapped and that", "06:03", "would have been the end of his campaign", "06:04", "first debate should have been over and", "06:06", "if you remember do you remember what he", "06:08", "said no I don't she said you said this", "06:10", "this isn't this about women and he", "06:12", "smiled they sort of looked at the", "06:14", "audience it looked like or the camera", "06:16", "and he said only Rosie O'Donnell and the", "06:20", "audience erupted in laughter completely", "06:22", "unexpected and a place inappropriate", "06:24", "provocative and and what I noticed was", "06:27", "the Rosie O'Donnell is that is a visual", "06:31", "image that everybody shares right you", "06:33", "got a picture of her see me say the name", "06:34", "and for his base that he was catering to", "06:37", "it was an unpopular image and one it", "06:40", "would just suck", "06:41", "all the energy away from the question", "06:43", "which was toxic and really you know you", "06:46", "can't touch the question you just have", "06:48", "to suck all the energy into another part", "06:49", "of the room and wait for the time to run", "06:51", "out and that's what he did", "06:53", "and it became the headline lobby you", "06:55", "know certainly it highlighted the things", "06:58", "he said about women maybe more than it", "07:00", "would have but the way he escaped that", "07:01", "got my attention and I thought that", "07:04", "doesn't look normal", "07:05", "alright that that's a that's operating", "07:08", "at another level and so I looked for", "07:10", "more examples of it and you could see it", "07:12", "everywhere and it was especially clear", "07:14", "by the time he started saying well the", "07:18", "other visual things he does is he says", "07:19", "build a wall and you can just imagine a", "07:22", "wall when he says were we're paying too", "07:25", "much ransom to a ram for those soldiers", "07:27", "he says we paid you know four hundred", "07:29", "million or whatever the number is he", "07:31", "goes imagine that money piled up it'd be", "07:33", "so much money I would fill this room you", "07:35", "can't even imagine that big pile of", "07:36", "money he always goes for the visual", "07:38", "because we know that the the visual part", "07:40", "of our brain is the dominant part and if", "07:42", "you can get its attention and get it on", "07:44", "your message it talks the rest of your", "07:46", "brain into anything you want it to when", "07:49", "he talks about Isis he goes visual also", "07:52", "he doesn't say they are bad people whose", "07:55", "religions you know has been distorted", "07:57", "you know the type of thing you might", "07:58", "hear from Hillary Clinton he says they", "08:01", "put you in cages and they drown you in", "08:04", "the cage they chop your head off I mean", "08:07", "you can see that your plan my head so", "08:10", "everything he does gets more attention", "08:13", "than everything everybody else does", "08:14", "because he puts it into a provocative", "08:16", "picture so that was the first thing I", "08:18", "noticed then when he got to Jeb Bush and", "08:21", "he needed to defeat Jeb because he was", "08:24", "the strongest competitor so if he", "08:25", "couldn't get past him there was no point", "08:27", "and he went after was strong and he went", "08:29", "after him fast and he went after him", "08:30", "with the low-energy", "08:31", "kill shot so I I call these linguistic", "08:34", "kill shots it's not just an insult it's", "08:38", "not just a clever nickname and we saw", "08:40", "Clinton try to come up with clever", "08:42", "nicknames add no and no purchase", "08:44", "whatsoever like dangerous Donald you", "08:46", "know it just didn't work but look at", "08:49", "look at low-energy Jeb here's how its", "08:50", "engineered its engineered for", "08:52", "confirmation bias", "08:54", "meaning that you want the future to make", "08:56", "this look like a better nickname every", "08:58", "day and you want it to match his", "09:00", "physicality", "09:01", "so before I ever heard low energy Jeb I", "09:05", "had a good impression of Jeb Bush like I", "09:07", "thought when you looked at him Jeb Bush", "09:09", "didn't you say to yourself this guy", "09:12", "looks like a cool character like no if", "09:14", "no but he looked like he was an in", "09:16", "control", "09:18", "calm reasonable exactly the person you'd", "09:21", "want if that if the nuclear question", "09:24", "came up if there was some big decision", "09:26", "Jeb Bush isn't going to get excited if", "09:28", "it seemed like a competent CEO", "09:30", "competency exactly and as soon as Trump", "09:34", "said low energy could you see him and", "09:36", "the other way he was low energy and he", "09:39", "will always be lowered and she lyin Ted", "09:40", "a lyin Ted lyin Ted was beautiful", "09:43", "Ted because you knew that because he's a", "09:45", "politician yeah sometime in the next", "09:47", "several months he's gonna say stuff that", "09:49", "you can say is a lie whether it is or", "09:51", "not Roger doesn't have to but more", "09:53", "importantly Ted has a physicality about", "09:57", "him that unfortunately he's got beady", "09:59", "eyes and I've said this before if you're", "10:02", "gonna cast a movie you know we need a", "10:04", "guy who's looks dishonest right it would", "10:07", "be his face right and unfortunately I", "10:10", "mean I don't know if he's actually", "10:11", "dishonest I'm not gonna make a judgement", "10:13", "so came up with the Zodiac killer thing", "10:16", "was that a Trump fan or was it Trump", "10:19", "himself that started saying that Ted was", "10:21", "the Zodiac killer uh I think that", "10:24", "probably started with a fan but so the", "10:27", "other thing that's fucking harsh man", "10:29", "you'd be giving speeches are you the", "10:31", "Zodiac killer people would scream it out", "10:33", "like imagine having to deal with that", "10:35", "and did your father kill you know", "10:37", "somebody yeah yeah his father was maybe", "10:40", "his dad was the Zodiac killer is that", "10:42", "what the cause is ODI killer was like", "10:44", "the 70s right might not be old enough oh", "10:48", "so crooked Hillary crooked Hillary same", "10:51", "thing for cotillion is a brilliant one", "10:52", "so she wasn't physically you know as", "10:55", "limber as a young person so she you", "10:57", "could imagine her sort of a little bit", "11:00", "crooked physically and you knew that", "11:02", "there would be stories coming out in", "11:03", "which people could say well there's", "11:05", "another example of that crookedness", "11:07", "you see but you thought that a physical", "11:09", "sense like the way she looked all I", "11:10", "thought about his corruption", "11:12", "I heard crooked Hillary I saw her like", "11:14", "with like a burglars mask on trying to", "11:16", "sneak away with bags that had dollar", "11:17", "signs on them yeah yeah that's what I", "11:19", "saw you know if you look at any one of", "11:20", "these individually his nicknames you you", "11:23", "could say well it's sort of random he", "11:24", "just got lucky but if you look at a ball", "11:26", "they all have that physicality they all", "11:28", "have the the priming so that you know", "11:31", "you confirmation bias will kick in", "11:33", "whatever you see after that will just", "11:35", "fit the label because it's the first", "11:37", "thing you think well he's a performer", "11:38", "you know you you can say Donald Trump is", "11:41", "a businessman he most certainly is even", "11:43", "most certainly is a real estate investor", "11:45", "but he's been a public figure for", "11:47", "decades and when you're a public figure", "11:49", "you're a performer he's performing all", "11:51", "the time and he's also he likes to win", "11:54", "and so when he's engaging in people he", "11:57", "makes it personal so he's gotten very", "11:58", "good at what's called playing the dozens", "12:00", "I know I'm playing the dozens is tell us", "12:02", "it's a insult thing you know like you", "12:04", "can like one guy like guys in the hood", "12:08", "in the inner cities this is a start out", "12:12", "as a black term but guy it's essentially", "12:14", "like a version of your mama contest like", "12:16", "some guys are way better at your mama", "12:18", "jokes they're way better at playing the", "12:20", "dozens you're way better at shitting on", "12:22", "other people around them and it's for", "12:24", "the entertainment of each other it's a", "12:25", "huge thing amongst comedians we shit on", "12:27", "each other constantly left and right but", "12:30", "it's generally encouraged and we all", "12:31", "enjoy it you know but when a guy has", "12:34", "decades and decades and decades of this", "12:36", "like Donald Trump but a very high level", "12:38", "because he's known to be a billionaire", "12:40", "investor who puts his name on every", "12:42", "everything in still win big which I", "12:44", "talked about developing systems for", "12:46", "succeeding one of the systems is to and", "12:49", "you do this to stack together what I", "12:52", "would call ordinary skills until your", "12:55", "stack is different than anybody else's", "12:56", "so in my case I'm not a great artist you", "12:59", "know I didn't take any write writing", "13:02", "courses but I'm pretty good at drawing", "13:05", "and I'm pretty good at writing up a", "13:06", "little bit funny so I put them together", "13:07", "and I couldn't do a comic strip because", "13:09", "it's rare that you get somebody who's", "13:11", "let's say in the top 10% of three", "13:13", "different things but it's not hard to be", "13:15", "in the top 10% of things if you're if", "13:17", "you're going after them so if you look", "13:19", "at Trump he wrote a book on negotiating", "13:21", "so he knows business he knows", "13:23", "negotiating he knows public speaking he", "13:26", "has a sense of humor a really good one", "13:27", "he's quick on his feet now he knows", "13:30", "politics you know from both the inside", "13:32", "and the outside", "13:34", "he knows Twitter if you you know I could", "13:36", "probably go on and you would say if you", "13:38", "looked at any one of those things he's", "13:41", "not the best you've ever seen", "13:42", "he's not the best public speaker the", "13:44", "funniest person etc but there aren't", "13:47", "many people who can do all of those", "13:49", "things in the top 10% you put as a", "13:52", "public speaker I don't think he's nearly", "13:54", "in the top 10%", "13:55", "I think he's I'm just being honest I", "13:57", "think he has very poor efficiency of", "14:01", "words like he uses he repeats himself", "14:05", "when it's not really important and when", "14:08", "we repeats itself what what I usually", "14:10", "see is like someone searching for the", "14:11", "next thing to say you know I'm saying", "14:13", "like he'll say you know I'm gonna be", "14:15", "honest with you I'm gonna be honest with", "14:17", "you okay I'm gonna be honest with you", "14:18", "here he'll do that in a way that is not", "14:20", "it's not efficient it's not efficient", "14:22", "but it's persuasive it that's way", "14:23", "sometimes but it also know repetition", "14:26", "repetition sometimes sometimes and", "14:29", "sometimes it's clunky yeah", "14:32", "I feel like he I feel like there's a lot", "14:34", "of times where it's his style to do that", "14:37", "and he's done it before but even like in", "14:40", "delivering lines you've got to know when", "14:43", "did not talk like here's breath example", "14:46", "when he said that he called the", "14:48", "president up the President of Mexico up", "14:49", "and they had the conversation about the", "14:51", "wall and he said the wall just got 10", "14:52", "foot higher he's like yeah that's what I", "14:54", "said", "14:54", "that is what I said like he repeats", "14:56", "outside he should have just let it hang", "14:58", "he should have said the wall just got", "15:00", "10-foot heart they would have went crazy", "15:01", "and he got a walk back and forth and", "15:03", "just sucked it in but he kept talking", "15:05", "that's not the best speaker like Obama I", "15:09", "feels way better public speaker way more", "15:12", "efficient with his words way better", "15:14", "control of the sentences that he speaks", "15:16", "me but it's more professional I think", "15:19", "you're judging on a standard that I", "15:21", "probably wouldn't use so I took the Dale", "15:23", "Carnegie course teaching you how to be a", "15:25", "public speaker and their course taught", "15:28", "you zero technique mmm of course on", "15:31", "public speaking in which they taught you", "15:33", "nothing about technique the things that", "15:35", "you're saying is doing read not", "15:36", "necessarily technique well let me just", "15:38", "finish that's not sure I'm sorry what", "15:39", "they tell you is just confidence and and", "15:42", "if you were happy and confident you", "15:44", "would almost always do well even if you", "15:46", "make mistake you just correct so he", "15:48",

"16:16", "I think that for absolutely one thing", "16:19", "you could say is he knows how to do the", "16:22", "Donald Trump thing and the Donald Trump", "16:25", "thing is very different than the rest of", "16:26", "the politicians think the Donald Trump", "16:28", "thing is not humble the Donald Trump", "16:30", "thing will tell you about his past", "16:32", "successes and use them to tell you how", "16:34", "he's going to be successful in the", "16:35", "future the Donald Trump thing when", "16:37", "confronted with certain things like the", "16:39", "thing about it you know him
