Rico", "12:21", "are not responsible for the national", "12:22", "debt so if they actually became a state", "12:24", "they would be in worse shape than they", "12:26", "are now they would actually have more", "12:27", "debt all right so you know it's like", "12:30", "it'd be like buying a ticket on the", "12:32", "Titanic after you've already you know it", "12:34", "hit the iceberg", "12:34", "you still want to buy tickets so", "12:36", "hopefully this is all a bunch of", "12:37", "politics and it won't become it won't", "12:40", "become a state and it'll just continue", "12:42", "you know they'll default on a lot of", "12:44", "debt hopefully they'll privatize a lot", "12:46", "of things they'll shrink the government", "12:48", "and more and more people like me will", "12:50", "come and start creating businesses and", "12:52", "hiring people and you know five ten", "12:54", "years from now maybe it'll be the", "12:56", "wealthiest part of the United States so", "12:58", "correct me if I'm wrong but the two", "12:59", "possibilities are it becomes a state and", "13:02", "they get more welfare they get more", "13:04", "essentially more aid more money yes or", "13:07", "it stays where it is and more people", "13:10", "like you have an incentive to go there", "13:12", "and then entrepreneurs open up", "13:13", "businesses and then there's more", "13:15", "opportunities and then the general", "13:17", "wealth of the island grows and that it", "13:20", "helps people just by", "13:21", "two of more profit yeah you got it", "13:23", "becoming a state just means a bigger",

"13:35", "know so that's gonna be a huge problem", "13:36", "if you know so good the probably the", "13:38", "appeal of being a state is that so many", "13:40", "people don't work but you know one thing", "13:42", "that we could do to help Puerto Rico is", "13:44", "get rid of the minimum wage because", "13:46", "they're stuck with our minimum wage", "13:47", "which is a disaster because the the", "13:50", "average income the average wage in", "13:52", "Puerto Rico is about half of what it is", "13:53", "in the United States and so the minimum", "13:55", "wage of 725 is like having a

you can't you", "14:06", "know people can't get jobs at these at", "14:09", "these wages you know the best example to", "14:11", "of America destroying one of its", "14:14", "possessions with the minimum wage was", "14:16", "American Samoa I love you ever read this", "14:18", "but a few years ago Congress applied the", "14:22", "minimum wage to all the territories our", "14:23", "minimum wage which included American", "14:25", "Samoa and in American Samoa", "14:27", "the biggest employers on the island were", "14:30", "these tuna Cantor's and so chicken you", "14:33", "know chicken of the sea or Starkist and", "14:35", "so all these people worked in these", "14:37", "factories canning the tuna and they", "14:39", "worked in in in American Samoa", "14:41", "well when the minimum wage was passed it", "14:45", "it made the island uncompetitive and so", "14:47", "the tuna factories closed down and fired", "14:49", "everybody and then so all of a sudden", "14:51", "there was like 30%

the the you know the", "15:00", "American Samoa didn't want the minimum", "15:02", "wage but you know American politicians", "15:04", "don't give a damn and all they care", "15:06", "about is feeling good about themselves", "15:08", "not about the consequences of what they", "15:09", "do and so they you know they they impose", "15:11", "that minimum wage and it was like", "15:13", "declaring war well it had a lot of", "15:15", "damage in Puerto Rico just not as much", "15:17", "as it did in American Samoa but if we", "15:20", "can get rid of that minimum wage in", "15:21", "Puerto Rico then

even have prices because when you", "42:30", "go to the doctor you don't even know", "42:31", "what things cost there's no price I mean", "42:33", "when you go to buy gas everybody has the", "42:35",

"42:42", "to put the price and I said what do you", "42:43", "care what the gas cost the insurance", "42:44", "company's paying for it right I mean", "42:46", "that's what we have with the health care", "42:47", "so yeah I mean we have a system that", "42:49", "government created where people rely on", "42:51", "health insurance to pay for everything", "42:53", "health insurance should just be for very", "42:56", "expensive things that are probably not", "42:58", "going to happen to you right I I get hit", "42:59", "by a car I get cancer you shouldn't use", "43:02", "your health insurance

the thesis of Obamacare was hey", "43:35", "let's make it so that insurance", "43:40", "companies can't discriminate against", "43:41", "people to have a pre-existing condition", "43:43", "right so they can't charge people more", "43:45", "money just because they happen to be", "43:47", "sick right this was one of the appeals", "43:49", "of it now here's the problem with that", "43:51", "the only reason people buy insurance", "43:53", "when they're healthy health insurance is", "43:55", "because they know they can't buy it when", "43:57", "there's with sick like let's say with", "43:58", "the auto insurance if there was a law", "44:02", "that said that our auto insurance", "44:03", "companies couldn't discriminate based on", "44:05", "pre-existing conditions if you can buy", "44:07", "the policy after your accident and get", "44:10", "coverage for the same price as if you", "44:12", "bought it before right nobody would buy", "44:15", "auto insurance right you would just wait", "44:17", "until you had an accident but isn't it", "44:18", "auto insurance a weird argument because", "44:20", "auto insurance is mandatory like you", "44:22", "have to have it whereas health insurance", "44:24", "is not mandatory but Obamacare kind of", "44:26", "makes it mandatory right well you're", "44:28", "just saying it's", "44:29", "for the wrong aspects yeah well either", "44:31", "chance that it covers the wrong things", "44:33", "well even look fire insurances in", "44:35", "mandatory either right no I mean", "44:36", "although insurance is in certain states", "44:39", "it is and of course not all coverage is", "44:40", "mandatory right yeah and you know you", "44:42", "have compulsory coverage yes um which is", "44:44", "similar to what you're talking about", "44:45", "with health insurance compulsory health", "44:47", "insurance like for catastrophic injuries", "44:50", "well they made it they Obamacare made it", "44:52", "compulsory because the point is this", "44:53", "that if auto insurance was not", "44:56", "compulsory right and you can just decide", "44:58", "whether or not you wanted it if there is", "45:01", "a law that said that insurance companies", "45:04", "couldn't discriminate nobody would buy", "45:05", "it because you would just wait till", "45:06", "after you had an accident but the", "45:07", "problem is not just that well the reason", "45:09", "why auto insurance is a bad example is", "45:11", "cuz you're gonna hit my car and you", "45:12", "gonna do damage to me if you have no", "45:14", "insurance in your car I'm not gonna be", "45:16", "running into you on the street and and", "45:18", "collide with my body and hurt you I say", "45:21", "I don't have health insurance and so you", "45:23", "get injured from me don't you think", "45:25", "that's a different argument well rather", "45:26", "than even make that argument let's just", "45:28", "go to fire insurance because there's", "45:29", "only one person

by the policies for the", "45:39", "same price so the reason that people buy", "45:41", "fire insurance policies before their", "45:44", "house burns down is because they know", "45:46", "that nobody will sell them a policy", "45:47", "after it burns right and the insurance", "45:50", "companies couldn't stay in business if", "45:52", "the only people who were buying policies", "45:53", "were
