your book whoo yes yes", "00:14", "it's great I mean I really appreciate", "00:17", "someone like you who's trying to break", "00:19", "down quantum mechanics and quantum", "00:21", "physics for someone like me it's very", "00:24", "hard to follow and there was a lot of", "00:26", "backing up and trying it again and", "00:28", "backing up and trying it again and like", "00:30", "going over paragraphs and trying to", "00:32", "figure out exactly what it means but", "00:35", "it's it's really excellent and really", "00:38", "perplexing at the same time well thank", "00:40", "you and you know it there are different", "00:42", "styles when it comes to writing popular", "00:45", "books I think there should be different", "00:46", "styles and my particular style is look", "00:49", "it's not gonna be a breezy page-turner", "00:52", "but if you read it carefully", "00:55", "like it's not prerequisites you don't", "00:57", "have to come into it as an expert but", "00:58", "you have to come into it is someone", "01:00", "who's willing to sit and think about", "01:02", "every paragraph and then hopefully", "01:03", "you'll be rewarding and you'll truly", "01:05", "understand what's going on after doing", "01:06", "that well it is rewarding because it is", "01:09", "fascinating and the history of quantum", "01:11", "physics is also pretty fascinating cuz", "01:14", "I've always wondered like how did", "01:15", "anybody even want to come up with this", "01:18", "stuff like yes and the fact that it was", "01:20", "so long ago", "01:21", "what the beginnings ever were in the", "01:23", "19th century right well 1900 is the", "01:25", "typical literally that year the turn of", "01:28", "the century when luck Splunk first got", "01:30", "the first hints of it and then yeah it", "01:32", "was took another 27 years to put it into", "01:34", "final shape now for regular people that", "01:38", "don't have a background of physics or", "01:40", "don't this is like the whole idea behind", "01:43", "it is so bizarre it's like why would", "01:47", "anybody try to figure out something that", "01:51", "one of the things that you said that's", "01:53", "really interesting is that you quantum", "01:57", "physics is used all the time it's used", "02:01", "with exact calculations but yet we don't", "02:05", "really understand it yeah yeah no that's", "02:08", "the main message of the book really", "02:10", "because physicists of course do quantum", "02:13", "mechanics", "02:13", "day whether it's you know straight", "02:15", "forward quantum mechanics quantum field", "02:16", "theory quantum information Kalam", "02:18", "computing clearly we're pretty good at", "02:19", "it you know like transistors and lasers", "02:21", "depend on quantum mechanics the

weird", "02:32", "but then we have quotes from people like", "02:34", "Richard Feynman saying nobody", "02:35", "understands quantum mechanics right and", "02:37", "so if he says that then there's some", "02:39", "authority behind it and the reason is", "02:42", "what we have is sort of a black box", "02:44", "right we say you know what I think what", "02:47", "I said in a New York Times article I", "02:48", "wrote recently is physicists understand", "02:51", "quantum mechanics in the same way that", "02:52", "someone who owns a smartphone", "02:53", "understands the smartphone like they", "02:55", "know how to use the apps they can call", "02:57", "people they can make phone calls they", "02:59", "can take pictures they don't know what's", "03:01", "going on inside and that's physicists", "03:04", "with quantum mechanics they they use it", "03:06", "they can make very very precise", "03:08", "predictions but if you ask them what is", "03:10", "really going on like what's actually", "03:12", "happening what are all the details are", "03:14", "like yeah no that's not our job let's", "03:15", "just stick to prediction but to someone", "03:16", "like me that's so terrifying because", "03:18", "like the very nature of reality is being", "03:21", "examined by people like if it is a", "03:26", "smartphone it's being examined by people", "03:29", "like me yeah who don't really understand", "03:32", "the smartphone I have no idea what", "03:34", "what's going on inside a smartphone I've", "03:36", "no I know some words that have used to", "03:39", "describe Ram and process all the", "03:42", "electrons moving out of there right but", "03:44", "yeah yeah and I think and it's in some", "03:47", "sense that's fine like most of us don't", "03:49", "need to know what's going on inside the", "03:51", "smartphone to use it but somebody should", "03:54", "know right and my argument in the book", "03:57", "is look the if 500 years from now when", "04:01", "historians write the history of 20th", "04:02", "century physics they will say two things", "04:04", "one is my god these people were so", "04:08", "brilliant and creative to invent quantum", "04:10", "mechanics and then they were so afraid", "04:14", "to really take it seriously and try to", "04:17", "understand it like they said like stop", "04:19", "asking questions about the meaning of", "04:21", "reality and what the world is doing in", "04:22", "my mind what physics is all about is", "04:26", "understanding reality in what the world", "04:28", "doing it's not just about making", "04:29", "predictions making predictions is good", "04:31", "but we do that you know mostly because", "04:34", "we're curious about what the world is", "04:36", "doing well for people outside the world", "04:38", "of academia when I read someone like you", "04:41", "saying that you were discouraged from", "04:44", "pursuing this and you literally told", "04:48", "that you should be pursuing your work in", "04:52", "cosmology and gravitation is that's", "04:54", "where it's at a serious work yeah that", "04:57", "seems to me be so crazy it's like if", "04:59", "anybody should be pursuing it it should", "05:02", "be people like you you know I mean I", "05:04", "want to be fair", "05:05", "so of course twentieth century physics", "05:07", "was incredibly successful and and there", "05:09", "was part of the attitude was look we", "05:11", "have to understand nuclear physics and", "05:14", "particle physics and you know a lot of", "05:16", "it was the center of physics shifted", "05:17", "from Europe to the US and and Europe is", "05:20", "much more philosophical and you're", "05:22", "willing to think about the deep ideas", "05:24", "and Americans are pretty pragmatic and", "05:25", "want to build things right in particular", "05:28", "at the time they wanted to build nuclear", "05:29", "weapons and so the idea of just really", "05:32", "putting aside deep philosophical issues", "05:34", "and putting stuff to work was attractive", "05:37", "and the other issue is you know ok let's", "05:39", "say we do demand that we understand", "05:41", "quantum mechanics better how do you do", "05:43", "it like what experiment is it there that", "05:45", "you can do as far as we know the", "05:47", "cookbook that we have even though we", "05:48", "don't understand it works pretty well", "05:50", "like what what could you type into your", "05:52", "smartphone that would help you", "05:53", "understand what's going on inside it's", "05:55", "kind of hard to figure out so I think", "05:57", "those attitudes were wrong but at least", "05:59", "you know they're not completely crazy", "06:00", "it's not just that they were afraid of", "06:03", "the truth or anything like that and I", "06:04", "also think that it is finally changing", "06:06", "now I think that there's slowly slowly", "06:08", "slowly more people are appreciating the", "06:10", "understanding quantum mechanics is", "06:11", "important well what do you attribute", "06:13", "that to a couple of things one is I mean", "06:17", "there's good news and bad news that part", "06:19", "of the good news is technology has", "06:21", "gotten better so we're trying to build", "06:23", "quantum computers for example and guess", "06:26", "what you know some of the ad hoc rules", "06:28", "that we had for doing quantum mechanics", "06:30", "might not be up to the task we need to", "06:32", "understand the details a little bit", "06:34", "better the other sadder thing is that so", "06:38", "much of fundamental physics is kind of", "06:40", "stuck", "06:41", "right now right we haven't we literally", "06:43", "have not been surprised by a new", "06:46", "experimental result in fundamental", "06:48", "physics since the 1970s Wow the one", "06:52", "there's one exception to that which is", "06:53", "the universe accelerating in 1998 which", "06:55", "is the dark energy we have had amazing", "06:59", "accomplishments in experimental and", "07:01", "observational physics we've found the", "07:03", "Higgs boson we found the top quark we", "07:05", "found gravitational waves the microwave", "07:07", "background many many things but they", "07:10", "were all predicted decades ago right so", "07:12", "progress is driven by being surprised", "07:15", "and it's been a long time since we've", "07:16", "been surprised so some people including", "07:18", "myself say well one of the things to do", "07:21", "in that situation is to take a step back", "07:22", "and re-examine the foundations maybe", "07:24", "maybe we can take a broader look and", "07:27", "think that we were walking down the", "07:28", "wrong path", "07:29", "now for people that don't have any", "07:31", "background in physics there there's a", "07:34", "bit of an issue with public perception", "07:37", "and one of the things about public", "07:39", "perception is films like what the bleep", "07:41", "yeah that sort of throw this sort of", "07:44", "cultish monkey wrench into the you know", "07:48", "quantum physics is weird enough as it is", "07:51", "yeah without adding that that movie was", "07:55", "literally created by a channeler right", "07:57", "rest of mine David Albert was one of the", "08:00", "leading philosophers of physics I should", "08:01", "also give credit to philosophers here", "08:03", "because they have been taking quantum", "08:04", "mechanics seriously longer than the", "08:05", "physicists have to be honest so David is", "08:09", "one of many people who got a PhD in", "08:10", "physics and then switched to philosophy", "08:12", "because he cared about the foundations", "08:13", "of quantum mechanics in no physics", "08:15", "department would ever hire him right", "08:16", "hilarious and yeah I tell the story went", "08:18", "through the back door yeah I tell the", "08:19", "story in the book like he wrote a bunch", "08:21", "of influential papers as a graduate", "08:23", "student and then he went and said I", "08:25", "would like to you know make these papers", "08:27", "my PhD thesis and they said no that's", "08:29", "not really serious physics and they", "08:31", "punished him by making him write this", "08:33", "incredibly technical mathematical paper", "08:35", "on quantum field theory just to prove he", "08:38", "could do it and then he's like this I I", "08:39", "don't take this anymore I'm switching", "08:41", "fields but anyway he was in that film he", "08:43", "was in what the bleep and they lied to", "08:47", "him they misrepresented themselves he", "08:49", "said we're doing a documentary about", "08:50", "quantum mechanics and they sat him down", "08:52", "for three hours", "08:53", "and asked him all these questions your", "08:55", "leading questions like doesn't this mean", "08:57", "that we're bringing reality into", "08:58", "existence by looking at it and he's like", "09:01", "no that's not what it means let me", "09:02", "explain to you then in the final film", "09:05", "there's like 30-second clips of him", "09:07", "going yes that is a really important", "09:09", "question right", "09:10", "like completely misrepresenting what he", "09:12", "said and so he went public after that", "09:15", "and and complained about and about the", "09:18", "film and he did in a hilarious story", "09:21", "there was a event some sort of", "09:25", "convention put on in Santa Monica by", "09:28", "supporters of the film that they thought", "09:30", "would be fun to get all of the people", "09:31", "who were in the movie what the bleep do", "09:33", "we know and get them at you know and", "09:35", "talk to them and charge people money to", "09:36", "listen to them but these people were not", "09:38", "affiliated with the filmmakers so they", "09:41", "didn't know the David Albert had been", "09:43", "completely misrepresented in the film so", "09:44", "they invited him and he goes to this", "09:46", "event in Santa Monica and he gave a talk", "09:49", "you know he decided he wondered like", "09:51", "should I just go at all but okay look", "09:53", "why not", "09:53", "let's reach a different audience and he", "09:55", "he gave a talk and he said look there's", "09:57", "two things you can do when you are faced", "09:59", "with fundamental puzzles of reality", "10:02", "one is you can face up to what the world", "10:05", "is trying to tell you and you can accept", "10:06", "it and take it as what it is no matter", "10:08", "what you like the other is you can", "10:11", "choose to tell a flattering story about", "10:13", "yourself and the people who made this", "10:16", "movie have decided that the mysteries of", "10:18", "quantum mechanics are really stories", "10:20", "about how they are powerful and have", "10:22", "influence over reality and so forth but", "10:24", "it's all nonsense and the punchline is", "10:27", "the audience loved it they went nuts", "10:30", "because what they wanted was a guru of", "10:31", "some sort and like he was just as good a", "10:33", "girl right so yeah he had a better story", "10:36", "a reality based reality guru yeah yeah", "10:39", "yeah so I think you're right I mean I", "10:40", "think that quantum mechanics I've said", "10:42", "before is uh of all the theories in the", "10:45", "history of science the most easily", "10:47", "distorted and misrepresented in the", "10:49", "popular mind well you've done an amazing", "10:51", "job in this book of trying to boil it", "10:54", "down for dummies like me but it's hard", "10:55", "it is it is a complicated and insanely", "10:59", "nuanced subject", "11:01", "yeah and it's one of those things where", "11:04", "it like this many worlds theory", "11:07", "for one example the the the just the", "11:10", "possibility that there's like explain", "11:14", "that just explain for for people that", "11:17", "don't understand what quantum mechanics", "11:19", "even means give them just like a little", "11:21", "bit of that and then explain many worlds", "11:23", "theory yeah good this is what I'm here", "11:25", "to do so thank you you know an electron", "11:28", "take an electron quantum mechanics", "11:30", "should apply to the entire universe but", "11:32", "it becomes unmistakable when you look at", "11:34", "little tiny things right so we always", "11:36", "are talking about electrons or atoms and", "11:38", "so forth an electron has a position and", "11:40", "well sorry let me not even say that that", "11:43", "even that was wrong it's just so hard to", "11:44", "correctly talk about come on our", "11:46", "mechanics right if you were Isaac Newton", "11:48", "before there was quantum mechanics there", "11:50", "was classical mechanics and basically", "11:52", "quantum mechanics and classical", "11:53", "mechanics are the only two big", "11:55", "frameworks that have ever existed in", "11:56", "physics you know classical mechanics was", "11:58", "so good that everyone thought that was", "12:00", "just right and it's all better filling", "12:02", "the details until quantum mechanics came", "12:03", "along and changed things in classical", "12:06", "mechanics an electron is a point it has", "12:08", "a position a location in space and has a", "12:10", "velocity it's moving somewhere and from", "12:12", "that you can predict what's gonna happen", "12:13", "okay quantum mechanics says no no no the", "12:17", "electron has a wavefunction so if", "12:20", "there's a wave you know sometimes you", "12:22", "hear this debate about are things like", "12:24", "electrons and photons particles are", "12:25", "waves the answer is that they are waves", "12:28", "and the wave function has this weird", "12:31", "property that when you're not looking at", "12:33", "it it's a wave it's all spread out or", "12:36", "it's localized somewhere but it obeys an", "12:38", "equation the Schrodinger equation so far", "12:40", "so good just like regular physics", "12:42", "there's a thing the wave function it'll", "12:43", "be is an equation the Schrodinger", "12:45", "equation you can predict what's gonna", "12:46", "happen next", "12:47", "but the weird thing about quantum", "12:48", "mechanics is that there's a whole", "12:50", "separate set of rules for what happens", "12:53", "when you look at the thing when you", "12:55", "observe it when you measure it that's", "12:57", "where things get squirrely with people", "12:59", "describing it right yes and that's where", "13:01", "they want to go it's an opening to be", "13:03", "woowoo right when you say like what do", "13:05", "you mean", "13:06", "observe something like does have to be a", "13:09", "conscious being can it be a video camera", "13:11", "you know that's just right here right", "13:13", "is it the act of measuring that changes", "13:15", "things well this is the puzzle okay this", "13:19", "is what is called the mesh", "13:20", "ermand problem of quantum mechanics that", "13:23", "the rules we teach our students at", "13:26", "Caltech or anywhere else when we teach", "13:27", "them quantum mechanics in their", "13:28", "sophomore year of college the rules say", "13:32", "when a system is observed when it is", "13:36", "measured its state it's wavefunction", "13:38", "changes dramatically suddenly and", "13:41", "unpredictably now let me ask you this", "13:42", "how do we know this based on if if", "13:45", "you're measuring it and it changes how", "13:48", "do we know because we didn't measure it", "13:50", "before like what what observations are", "13:52", "we making that we understand the state", "13:54", "of it before its measured without", "13:56", "measuring it good there's a couple of", "13:58", "ways so let me make things even simpler", "14:01", "forget about where the electron is", "14:03", "located and think about the electron is", "14:05", "spinning right electron is spinning just", "14:08", "like the Earth spins it's really exactly", "14:09", "like that it's like a little spinning", "14:11", "top except when you measure the spin you", "14:13", "can sort of send the electron through a", "14:15", "magnetic field and it will get deflect", "14:16", "either up or down depending on whether", "14:18", "it's spinning spin up or spin down you", "14:20", "only ever get one of two answers it's", "14:22", "either going up or going down it's", "14:23", "nowhere in between this is an empirical", "14:25", "measured fact okay so that's a part of", "14:29", "quantum mechanics that that's the", "14:31", "quantum fact that there's discrete set", "14:34", "of possible answers to this question is", "14:36", "it spinning clockwise or", "14:37", "counterclockwise yes or no that's just", "14:39", "those two possibilities nowhere in", "14:40", "between so if you're if you have a", "14:43", "magnetic field that is oriented", "14:44", "vertically send your electron through it", "14:47", "it gets deflected up you say oh it's", "14:48", "spin up so now I've measured its spin", "14:51", "now I know what its state is if I send", "14:54", "it through another magnetic field or", "14:56", "oriented vertically it will always be", "14:59", "deflected up every single time we know", "15:00", "what it is we're gonna measure it", "15:02", "measuring it in this case doesn't change", "15:04", "it it's in exactly that state we know it", "15:06", "okay now let's send it through a", "15:09", "magnetic field that is oriented", "15:11", "horizontally so it's gonna be deflected", "15:13", "either right or left we know exactly", "15:15", "what state it's in it's spinning this", "15:16", "way but when you send it through that", "15:19", "magnetic field that's oriented", "15:20", "horizontally it gets deflected left or", "15:22", "right 50/50 unpredictably there's no way", "15:25", "we can predict it hmm and then once it", "15:28", "is so okay now it's been spinning up you", "15:30", "measured it spin left let's say send it", "15:33", "through another magnet that", "15:34", "is going vertically and now it's 5050", "15:36", "again it could be spin-up or spin-down", "15:38", "so somehow even though we knew exactly", "15:41", "what state it was in", "15:42", "we couldn't predict what would happen", "15:44", "next that is part of quantum mechanics", "15:46", "so the act of sending it through these", "15:49", "things where it makes it vertical or", "15:51", "horizontal in what is what's happening", "15:54", "to it when it's going through these", "15:56", "things so in quantum mechanics what we", "15:58", "say is that it's not that we don't know", "16:01", "whether the electron is bending", "16:03", "clockwise or counterclockwise", "16:05", "it can be in a superposition of both", "16:07", "that's just the spin version of the", "16:10", "position of the electron can be spread", "16:11", "out in a wave right it's it's truly not", "16:15", "just that we are lacking some knowledge", "16:17", "is that the knowledge really isn't there", "16:19", "and again this is how we teach quantum", "16:21", "mechanics and textbooks and then I'm", "16:23", "gonna correct it because many-worlds is", "16:25", "much better but this is the standard", "16:26", "textbook version there's a wave function", "16:29", "the wave function for a spin is it's", "16:31", "either up or down or some combination", "16:32", "and then there's a rule that says when", "16:35", "you measure the spin you only get up or", "16:37", "down you don't see the wave function", "16:38", "just like the cloud that you have for", "16:41", "the electrons position when you look at", "16:43", "it you see it at a location so another", "16:46", "way to get to make the same argument is", "16:48", "take a little piece of I have a nice", "16:51", "little image of this when I give talks a", "16:53", "little piece of uranium so it's a", "16:55", "radioactive a little

that can't be right that can't be", "22:42", "the final answer the wavefunction must", "22:43", "somehow collapse and Evert said no what", "22:46", "you're missing is there's now two", "22:47",

"23:38", "that's existing in this super state so I", "23:41", "mean there's a couple of answers to that", "23:42", "one is you know sure if I think about it", "23:45", "like I really do believe it you know I", "23:46", "have a chapter in the book which my", "23:49", "editor resisted at first but then he let", "23:51", "me get away with it which is a dialogue", "23:53", "between a young philosopher

him and", "24:04", "at the end you know his last question is", "24:06", "you know do you really believe this I", "24:08", "said you feel like taking this seriously", "24:09", "and look that's a perfectly at a good", "24:12", "question it's a very respectable", "24:14", "question because it is many worlds it's", "24:17", "not crazy or weird or bizarre but it's", "24:20", "certainly very very far away from our", "24:22", "everyday experience right so what it's", "24:25", "asking you to do is to say", "24:27", "I have these equations they are really", "24:30", "really good at fitting what I

you think of each choice that you", "25:19", "make possibly changing everything", "25:23", "about the world that you exist in how", "25:25", "how are you looking at it if you don't", "25:28", "I'm saying because you know you are a", "25:30", "guy who probably understands it as good", "25:32", "as anybody that's alive so as weird as", "25:34", "this stuff sounds to me it sounds like", "25:37",

"25:45", "gonna see I know it's getting hot in", "25:46", "here you guys physics is heating us up", "25:53", "yeah I'm not exactly sure how to say it", "25:55", "the best you know it doesn't it doesn't", "26:00", "change who you are it's certainly not", "26:02", "true that you making a decision is what", "26:05", "branch is the wavefunction in the", "26:06", "universe I guess that's the right thing", "26:07", "to say because I want to stop all whoo", "26:09", "yeah you can happen everyone you know", "26:12", "believe the breaks the joke about how", "26:14", "certain political choices

you can download if you", "26:31", "have an iPhone called universe splitter", "26:32", "which will branch the wave function of", "26:35", "the universe for you and then if you", "26:37", "agree ahead of time to do one thing in", "26:38", "one branch and another thing in another", "26:39", "branch then there", "26:40", "we'll be multiple copies of you or", "26:42", "living different lives and then you can", "26:45", "deal with that in your therapist however", "26:46", "you like but what is the application", "26:48", "exactly doing what it's doing is a", "26:51", "basically a version of measuring the", "26:53", "spin of it's called universe glitter", "26:55", "universe splitters only for iPhones", "26:57", "sorry and people yeah sorry it's not", "27:01", "even a webpage is only a only an app", "27:03", "there's equivalent webpages but okay I'm", "27:04", "pulling it up right now yeah and what so", "27:06", "what you can do it basically it sends a", "27:08", "signal to a lab that coincidentally is", "27:10", "located in Geneva Switzerland but has", "27:12", "nothing to do with the Higgs boson or", "27:13", "anything like that they send a single", "27:16", "photon down a pipe to what's called a", "27:18", "beam splitter so the wave function of", "27:20", "the photon goes 5050 it gets sent left", "27:23", "it gets sent right and if you agree and", "27:26", "so then it sends back whether you ended", "27:28", "up in the branch of the wavefunction", "27:30", "where it went left or where there you go", "27:32", "199 come on yeah that's colors of", "27:34", "changing the universe is in your hand", "27:36", "download paid for it I got it right here", "27:38", "yeah right", "27:39", "so if you have any tough choices you can", "27:42", "type in like you know I want to have", "27:44", "pizza or I want to have Chinese food for", "27:47", "dinner tonight", "27:47", "well it says in one universe I will take", "27:49", "a chance in the other one I will place", "27:51", "oh yeah but you can you can correct", "27:52", "those you can fill in whatever you want", "27:54", "really yeah that's the good part what", "27:57", "what is what is happening what I will", "27:59", "ask her to marry me I will not ask her", "28:00", "to marry me I will accept this job I", "28:03", "will go somewhere else the equivalent of", "28:04", "a quantum fortune cookie yeah but except", "28:08", "that all possible fortunes in different", "28:11", "universes the bad news is you can't ever", "28:14", "find out how things went in the other", "28:16", "universe talks is a different universe", "28:17", "that's the problem right so the problem", "28:19", "will be paralyzed by analysis that's why", "28:21", "it's you should act the same as if you", "28:24", "just lived in one universe because you", "28:26", "can never talk to that people and the", "28:27", "other ones hmm so but now let's hit hit", "28:30", "the brakes on the whoo again yeah", "28:32", "because people would like to believe", "28:34", "that there are I mean are there an", "28:38", "infinite number of views existing at the", "28:43", "exact same time making various choices", "28:45", "which send you off in a different", "28:47", "directions so number one we don't know", "28:49", "if it's infinite number or just really", "28:51", "big but there's certainly a really", "28:52", "really big number it's", "28:53", "big enough to be you know big enough for", "28:56", "whatever you want but it's not", "28:57", "everything it's not the theory does not", "28:58", "say everything happens somewhere right", "29:01", "the theory says the Schrodinger equation", "29:03", "is obeyed there's an equation that is", "29:04", "obeyed so electrons will never convert", "29:08", "into protons because

right so there's", "29:16", "plenty of things that don't happen but", "29:18", "then there are plenty of things that do", "29:19", "happen and some things are more likely", "29:21", "than others for you to experience so", "29:22", "again it's it's sort of a you know it's", "29:25", "a mind-bending thing but it's a", "29:27", "straightforward prediction of the", "29:28", "equations and it doesn't affect our", "29:30", "lives if there's no rule that says you", "29:31", "know to be a moral person to be a good", "29:34", "utilitarian and make the world happy", "29:36", "knowing that the world the

now and if you hit", "30:11", "the button and branch the wavefunction", "30:13", "there'll be two different people both of", "30:14", "whom used to be you but not the same", "30:17", "person anymore

happens", "56:56", "when the wavefunction branches is this", "56:57", "so a typical question will try to", "57:00", "address is in ordinary quantum mechanics", "57:03", "we say if I send the electron through", "57:06", "one way or I sent it through the elect", "57:07", "the other way there's a 50/50 chance", "57:09", "that I will see it go left or go right", "57:11", "and someone says what do you

like", "58:03", "that not a very large number like if you", "58:05", "say how many people would classify", "58:06", "themselves as particle physicists do be", "58:08", "tens of thousands I remember there's a", "58:10", "woman who came to the comedy store", "58:13", "after the last podcast that we did and", "58:15", "she apparently is also working on it and", "58:17", "she was trying to explain it to me her", "58:20", "version of it you know after hearing", "58:23", "your version of it was very similar but", "58:25", "I believe she was from Romania", "58:26", "so she was struggling a little bit with", "58:28", "English okay so excited to discuss it", "58:31", "it's so fascinating when you see someone", "58:33", "who's like for the limited number of how", "58:37", "many of you guys there are and gals", "58:39", "there are out there I mean whatever the", "58:41", "number is when that spark gets ignited", "58:45", "and other people start tuning into it", "58:48", "she was so excited that this was being", "58:50", "discussed on a podcast and she wanted to", "58:52", "talk to me about yet to say you know", "58:54", "please have more people on please talk", "58:56", "about this more you know we need support", "58:58", "we need you know it's it is it's it does", "59:03", "baffle me a little bit how difficult it", "59:05", "is swimming uphill to get more support", "59:08", "for this kind of thing because it is", "59:10", "just an enormous privilege to be able to", "59:14", "call your job thinking about the", "59:17", "fundamental nature of reality right like", "59:19", "you know I gave my first book tour talk", "59:21", "was last Tuesday and I had dinner the", "59:23", "night before with you know several", "59:25", "philosophers of physics in the New York", "59:27", "area if you know from Columbia NYU and", "59:29", "ever and and you know we're all friends", "59:31", "and we could talk about you know our", "59:32", "cats and our cars but every single word", "59:35", "discussed at the table all night long", "59:37", "was about the philosophy of physics is", "59:39", "it because you guys work in isolation", "59:40", "essentially and then when you get", "59:41", "together you just you're so pumped up to", "59:44", "be discussing these things like minded", "59:47", "Souls you know in part yeah I mean I", "59:49", "there's no one else", "59:50", "in the physics department at Caltech who", "59:52", "cares about these issues I mean some of", "59:54", "them care in the sense that they are", "59:56", "happy that I'm doing it but no one does", "59:57", "it well itselves", "59:59", "yeah well there's a couple other people", "60:01", "in the philosophy department who care", "60:02", "about these and the folks you were", "60:04", "saying get pushed into philosophy and", "60:06", "why is that I mean is it just because", "60:08", "it's so complex that it's so esoteric", "60:10", "there's so many people that just they do", "60:13", "the the support for its not there but", "60:15", "the support for philosophy is more", "60:18", "common in mainstream yeah you know", "60:19", "there's different kinds of support one", "60:21", "kind of support in academia is who do", "60:23", "you hire right what what areas do you", "60:26", "want like a physics department will", "60:27", "generally say yeah we should have some", "60:30", "people doing particle physics some", "60:31", "people doing astrophysics some people", "60:33", "doing condensed matter in solid-state", "60:34", "physics and and then and then it becomes", "60:36", "hard do we need people doing biophysics", "60:39", "do we need people doing this and by the", "60:41", "time they get to the foundations of", "60:42", "quantum mechanics there's there's", "60:43", "usually very little support philosophers", "60:47", "there their job is being patient and", "60:50", "clarifying difficult conceptual", "60:52", "questions and so they get that quantum", "60:55", "mechanics is fertile territory for", "60:58", "philosophy like it you know one of the", "61:01", "big problems in philosophy compared to", "61:03", "science is that many of the questions", "61:05", "that they're asking cannot be tested", "61:07", "experimentally right what is infinity", "61:11", "well you know it's hard to do an", "61:13", "experiment there but it's an important", "61:14", "question right and so you need patience", "61:17", "but also it's harder to make progress", "61:20", "because it's easy to be trapped by your", "61:22", "intuition right like when it's just you", "61:25", "thinking and trying to think hard and be", "61:26", "rational and so forth it's easy to fall", "61:28", "into a trap of well this looks", "61:30", "reasonable to me and quantum mechanics", "61:32", "doesn't look reasonable to anybody so", "61:34", "it's a wonderful corrective it's a", "61:36", "wonderful reality check when you think", "61:38", "well reality has to be this way and then", "61:39", "someone can say well look at quantum", "61:41", "mechanics that's different than what you", "61:42", "said so philosophy and quantum mechanics", "61:45", "they sort of they they share some sort", "61:49", "of a border yeah oh yeah absolutely I", "61:51", "mean the things so I I was always a big", "61:55", "fan of philosophy ever since I was an", "61:57", "undergraduate and I discovered it for", "61:58", "the first time but when I was", "62:00", "undergraduate and my favorite philosophy", "62:02", "classes were like the philosophy of", "62:04", "morale", "62:04", "your political philosophy right I took", "62:07", "philosophy of science classes but they", "62:09", "seem to be kind of dry to me because", "62:11", "they were all about how scientific", "62:13", "theories are constructed and chosen you", "62:15", "know the structure of scientific", "62:16", "revolutions is the famous book that", "62:18", "everyone reads people like Thomas Kuhn", "62:20", "and Paula abend and so forth and okay", "62:23", "that's interesting but it's sort of meta", "62:25", "science right it's like how science is", "62:27", "done not how the world works and it", "62:30", "wasn't until you know circa 2000 that I", "62:32", "discovered that there are philosophers", "62:35", "of physics who are kind of really doing", "62:37", "physics you know that they're not asking", "62:39", "how physics works they're asking how the", "62:40", "world works but they're asking in a way", "62:42", "that is comfortably located in", "62:45", "philosophy departments and right now not", "62:47", "so much in physics departments there was", "62:49", "a part of the book that that shocked me", "62:52", "because I had a ridiculous idea once and", "62:54", "this idea was not my idea apparently La", "62:58", "Paz had a very similar idea as a thought", "63:02", "experiment I had an idea once that if", "63:04", "one day there was a computer that was so", "63:07", "powerful that it could accurately", "63:09", "describe every single object on earth", "63:12", "that we would be able to figure out the", "63:14", "past and La Paz was saying that not only", "63:18", "that would he propose for the entire", "63:20", "universe like every single object", "63:22", "electron everything in the atom in the", "63:25", "entire universe that you would not only", "63:27", "be able to show the past but also", "63:29", "predict the future that's right so this", "63:31", "is called Laplace's daemon although he", "63:34", "never called to that pier Simone Laplace", "63:36", "was a brilliant guy he deserves to be", "63:38", "much more well known so I base I think", "63:40", "I've mentioned him is his name in every", "63:41", "book that I've ever written for totally", "63:43", "different reasons he helped invent", "63:45", "probability as we currently understand", "63:46", "it for example but yeah so Isaac Newton", "63:50", "came up with the rules of classical", "63:52", "mechanics in the 1600s but it wasn't", "63:54", "until Laplace around the Year 1800 that", "63:57", "this implication of classical mechanics", "63:59", "was realized it's a clockwork universe", "64:01", "that the way classical mechanics works", "64:04", "is if you tell me the state of a system", "64:06", "right now at one moment by which in", "64:09", "classical mechanics you would mean the", "64:10", "position and the velocity of every part", "64:12", "and you knew the laws of physics and you", "64:15", "had arbitrarily large computational", "64:17", "capacity", "64:18", "Laplace said of vast intelligence okay", "64:21", "then to that vast intelligence the past", "64:24", "and future would be as determined and", "64:26", "known as the present was because that's", "64:29", "the clockwork universe is deterministic", "64:31", "everything is fixed once you know the", "64:32", "present moment now quantum mechanics", "64:35", "comes along and throws a spanner into", "64:37", "the works a little bit if you're a", "64:39", "many-worlds person Laplace is demon is", "64:43", "still possible so if you know the wave", "64:44", "function of the universe exactly and you", "64:47", "have infinite calculational capacity you", "64:50", "could predict the past and the future", "64:51", "with perfect accuracy but what you're", "64:54", "predicting is all of the branches of the", "64:56", "wavefunction so any individual person", "64:59", "inside the wavefunction still", "65:01", "experiences apparently random events", "65:04", "right so you can't predict what will", "65:06", "happen to you even if you can predict", "65:07", "what will happen to the entire universe", "65:09", "whew Shawn care my goodness there's a", "65:14", "lot of people pause in this podcast", "65:16", "right now just shaking their head like", "65:17", "you know I wrote a little article that", "65:20", "just appeared in quantum magazine which", "65:22", "by the way if anyone here is a science", "65:24", "fan quantum magazine is the best online", "65:26", "magazine for science these days they", "65:28", "have really really good high-level our", "65:29", "articles about all sorts of things and", "65:31", "so I wrote an article called what is", "65:34", "probability because you know again this", "65:37", "is a philosophers kind of question like", "65:39", "you know physicist will just put it to", "65:40", "use and get on with their lives", "65:42", "philosophers will say well what do you", "65:43", "really mean by probability the", "65:46", "traditional answer is if you're flipping", "65:48", "a coin and you say it's 5050 what you", "65:50", "mean by that is that if you flipped it", "65:53", "an infinite number of times half the", "65:55", "time it would be heads half the time it", "65:57", "would be tails that's what you mean it's", "65:58", "called the frequentist idea probability", "66:01", "but then what do you say like well what", "66:03", "is the probability that Donald Trump", "66:06", "wins re-election that's not gonna happen", "66:08", "infinite number of times you're not", "66:10", "gonna do the experiment or even better", "66:11", "what was the probability that Lee Harvey", "66:14", "Oswald actually was the lone shooter of", "66:16", "JFK that already happened that's in the", "66:18", "past right right but we can easily say", "66:21", "well I think it was an 80% chance that", "66:22", "that's true right so this is called", "66:24", "Bayesian probability where rather than", "66:27", "thinking of an infinite number of things", "66:29", "going on you're assigning a degree of", "66:31", "confidence", "66:32", "to your lack of perfect knowledge right", "66:34", "like I don't know exact there's", "66:36", "something yeah there's something going", "66:37", "on I don't know what it is so I assign a", "66:40", "probability and and that just like a", "66:42", "frequency that you know those the the", "66:44", "credence as we say that you assigned to", "66:46", "these different ideas is a positive", "66:48", "number then all the credence is add up", "66:50", "to one because something happened so in", "66:53", "quantum mechanics is is probability more", "66:57", "like frequentist probability or is it", "66:59", "more like Bayesian probability the", "67:00", "answer is it depends on what your", "67:01", "favorite version of quantum mechanics is", "67:03", "in one of these spontaneous collapse", "67:05", "theories it's very much like a frequency", "67:08", "like you know you just things happen", "67:10", "randomly and it's purely

little", "70:56", "bit you get their foot wet but they got", "70:57", "to work on respectable stuff that will", "70:59", "get them a job also", "71:00", "that's interesting so you're protecting",

think it's", "71:52", "especially these days when computer", "71:55", "graphics are really good right and we", "71:57", "can visualize things yeah we couldn't", "71:59", "our yeah that and that was in

the real", "72:08", "book has pictures yeah I'm sorry I", "72:13", "should have brought a copy is that out", "72:14", "last week okay so it is out now we'll", "72:18", "send you a copy then oh that'll be", "72:20", "better but honestly all the pictures in", "72:22", "the book were made by me using adobe", "72:24", "illustrator and this is not really my", "72:26", "area of expertise so it's not like", "72:28", "high-level graphics it's just barely", "72:30", "functional yeah especially you know", "72:33", "there's so much history in there I had", "72:35", "the idea before I actually wrote

Nazis for talk about the 1930s", "72:54", "right Einstein fled Germany the", "72:56", "personalities are very different and you", "72:58", "know Bohr Niels Bohr is this amazing", "73:01", "figure I had David Albert on my podcast", "73:03", "on mindscape and the same David Albert", "73:07", "who appeared in what the bleep and we", "73:09", "talked about quantum mechanics in the", "73:11",

would be Niels Bohr and", "73:21", "because like he was certainly a very an", "73:24", "amazingly good physicist very very", "73:26", "influential but over and over again", "73:29", "SuperDuper smart people would get", "73:32", "together and talk to Niels Bohr and come", "73:34", "away spouting nonsense about the", "73:36", "foundations of quantum mechanics somehow", "73:38", "he had this magic charisma that worked", "73:41", "in a bad direction to like make people", "73:43", "just become crazy about quantum", "73:45", "mechanics in a bad way and that's part", "73:46", "of the reason why we haven't dug into", "73:49", "the foundations of quantum theory why", "73:51", "what was it about him he was just", "73:53", "incredibly charismatic in a weird way", "73:56", "because he was a terrible writer you", "73:58", "know there's this story where he Heinz", "74:00", "Stein wrote this paper about", "74:01", "entanglement and spooky action at a", "74:03", "distance", "74:03", "and Bohr responded to it and everyone", "74:07", "said you know cuz by this time 1935", "74:09", "people were already bored with the", "74:10", "foundations of quantum mechanics and", "74:12", "they didn't want to think about it so if", "74:13", "anyone said well what about Einstein's", "74:15", "worries they would just say Oh Bohr", "74:17", "wrote a paper don't worry about it and", "74:19", "Bohr's paper was reprinted in this you", "74:21", "know book you could buy and then you", "74:24", "could read it and the pages were printed", "74:27", "in the wrong order and no one noticed", "74:30", "and like it's just hard to make sense of", "74:33", "what he said so he would pretend to", "74:35", "understand what I was saying even though", "74:37", "it was in the wrong order that's how", "74:39", "weird it is yeah that's and that's how", "74:41", "bad a communicator he was but in person", "74:44", "everyone loved him like John Wheeler who", "74:47", "is who Everett's advisor was a sort of", "74:51", "an acolyte aboard he he their sentences", "74:53", "he said like I never knew what people", "74:56", "meant when they talked about people like", "74:58", "Jesus or Socrates or Buddha until I met", "75:00", "Niels Bohr hmm so he had some magnetism", "75:04", "he had that's why that's why I David", "75:06", "Albert wanted to like mean him he's like", "75:07", "what what did that guy have like what", "75:09", "was it like to talk to him that people", "75:10", "loved him so much even though he was", "75:12", "kind of wrong about the formation the", "75:14", "clock mechanics but it's at least", "75:16", "someone who's charismatic who has that", "75:18", "sort of enigmatic personality at least", "75:22", "it could spark interest yeah that's", "75:24", "right so you know part of", "75:26", "the reason I wanted to write this book", "75:27", "is I it's very much like you know", "75:30", "another thing I do is go around and talk", "75:32", "about science and religion and I'm an", "75:34", "atheist myself so I say that you know", "75:36", "science leads us to not believe in God", "75:38", "and I talk about this to very different", "75:40", "audiences churches and things like that", "75:42", "sometimes how's that going well it", "75:46", "depends very much on the age of the", "75:48", "person in the audience is the thing", "75:50", "older people like they made up their", "75:51", "minds they're not they're not going to", "75:53", "change but young people even a very very", "75:55", "very religious young people are", "75:57", "fascinated by what I have to say it's", "75:59", "not that they changed their mind right", "76:00", "away but I've never heard someone put it", "76:02", "that way before right and maybe they do", "76:06", "change their mind later maybe not but at", "76:07", "least they've heard a perspective that", "76:08", "they were not exposed to earlier I think", "76:11", "the same thing is true with quantum", "76:12", "mechanics like there's a buttload of", "76:15", "books about quantum mechanics on the", "76:16", "market there's no shortage of books", "76:17", "about quantum mechanics but they're", "76:19", "mostly with this spirit of isn't this", "76:21", "bizarres and this weird we'll never", "76:23", "understand it and I think that that many", "76:26", "many people who grew up to be physicists", "76:28", "this is what they're doing when they're", "76:29", "12 years old they're reading these books", "76:30", "right and so I wanted to write a book", "76:32", "which said like actually we could maybe", "76:34", "understand this if we just tried it's", "76:36", "not ineffably mysterious let's let's you", "76:39", "know be embarrassed that the field of", "76:41", "physics has not put its effort into it", "76:43", "and make an effort here and so maybe", "76:46", "that will so that's what my you know", "76:48", "most ambitious hope for a book like this", "76:50", "is that 20 years from now there'll be a", "76:52", "flood of young physicists who think this", "76:54", "is really interesting", "76:55", "yeah well the number what would you", "76:57", "estimate it would be currently like how", "76:59", "many people do you think yeah it's of", "77:01", "order a hundred that's it I think so", "77:04", "yeah like you know when we have", "77:06", "conferences there's often 12 people", "77:07", "there or 20 people holy shit maybe", "77:09", "there's more because I haven't met them", "77:11", "all but it always depends on how you", "77:12", "draw the boundaries also whereas yeah", "77:15", "there's thousands or tens of thousands", "77:16", "of people in most subfields of physics", "77:18", "so I mean why would you go into the", "77:20", "subfield where there's no money or", "77:21", "promotion yes but still that's stunning", "77:28", "when you hear that it's somewhere around", "77:30", "100 I mean we have here in California we", "77:33", "have sequin the California quantum", "77:36", "interpretation Network which is a group", "77:38", "of us you know", "77:39", "people we know in California who care", "77:41", "about these issues and meet to talk", "77:42", "about them and it's like 15 people Wow", "77:46", "and weekend it depends on where you draw", "77:48", "the boundaries and so forth but funny", "77:50", "you guys kicks the bucket I know that's", "77:52", "how we get to brink get new blood in", "77:53", "there yeah it's but like I said I do", "77:56", "think it's it's growing it's expanding", "77:58", "and I'm optimistic I tend to be", "78:01", "optimistic you know there is this yeah I", "78:04", "alluded to a before but let's emphasize", "78:06", "it we turned on the Large Hadron", "78:09", "Collider in 2009 we turned it on in 2008", "78:13", "and then it exploded we fixed it and", "78:15", "turn it on again in 2009 and it found", "78:18", "the Higgs boson in 2012 and it didn't", "78:21", "find anything else and that's bad that's", "78:26", "bad for physics in a big way because", "78:29", "it's great that we had a theory that was", "78:32", "the king true with the Higgs boson but", "78:34", "in some sense we learned from the Large", "78:37", "Hadron Collider the smallest amount it", "78:39", "was possible for us to learn there's a", "78:41", "Higgs boson and that's it about quark", "78:44", "gluon plasma yeah that's great but we", "78:47", "knew it was there I mean we'll learn", "78:48", "details about it but the fundamental", "78:50", "underlying laws that give rise to that", "78:52", "we've known since the 70s hmm", "78:54", "so there's a million things we learned", "78:56", "about you know like for the", "78:58", "gravitational waves for measuring the", "78:59", "Higgs boson we pin down numbers we", "79:02", "measure the Cosmic Microwave Background", "79:03", "the leftover radiation from the Big Bang", "79:05", "but you would like something more that", "79:07", "you could bring to people saying that", "79:08", "this is very very valuable and tangible", "79:11", "stuff well not just that I wanted to", "79:13", "make progress right so we had good", "79:16", "reason to think that there should be a", "79:18", "bunch of other particles that you", "79:19", "discover at the Large Hadron Collider", "79:21", "and they weren't there", "79:22", "meanwhile we have very good reason to", "79:24", "think that 25% of the matter in the", "79:26", "universe is dark matter 25% of the", "79:28", "energy in the universe and we had very", "79:30", "good reason to hope that we could detect", "79:32", "it by now in an underground laboratory", "79:34", "and we haven't and it's there but it's", "79:36", "beyond our reach somehow so it's just so", "79:39", "hard to make progress under these", "79:41", "circumstances and meanwhile we have big", "79:43", "cool ideas like string theory that are", "79:46", "hard to connect to the real world so", "79:49", "this is the last third of the book to me", "79:52", "is you know again like I have my", "79:53", "favorite", "79:53", "ideas but there's a bigger picture about", "79:55", "what kinds of ideas we should pursue and", "79:58", "how we should pursue them so the last", "79:59", "sort of the book is maybe we need to", "80:01", "understand quantum mechanics to better", "80:04", "understand quantum gravity in the theory", "80:06", "of everything you know like what should", "80:08", "how should we expect to understand", "80:10", "quantum gravity if we don't understand", "80:11", "quantum mechanics come on all right and", "80:14", "what was the motivation behind starting", "80:16", "your podcast", "80:16", "it's called mine scapes mindscape yeah", "80:18", "mindscape um yeah I've been having lots", "80:21", "of fun with the podcast it's been great", "80:23", "and several episodes about quantum", "80:26", "mechanics most recently just last week I", "80:28", "did a whole two-hour solo episode on how", "80:30", "space-time can emerge from quantum", "80:32", "mechanics the I'll tell you that the", "80:35", "motivation was when I wrote my previous", "80:37", "book the big picture it was a sprawling", "80:40", "book so it's not only physics but also", "80:42", "philosophy and neuroscience and biology", "80:45", "and math and computer science there's a", "80:47", "whole bunch of things in there that I'm", "80:49", "not an expert on I'm a big believer that", "80:50", "people should talk about things they're", "80:52", "not an expert on but they should talk", "80:53", "about them in some sense of humility", "80:55", "that I don't understand everything here", "80:57", "so I will talk to some experts right so", "80:59", "I went around talking to experts so you", "81:00", "know I interviewed people I had so much", "81:02", "fun because I was writing a book I could", "81:04", "literally just email a Nobel", "81:06", "prize-winning biologist and say could I", "81:07", "drop by and talk to you for an hour and", "81:09", "they'd say yes and when the book was", "81:11", "done that went away I can't I can't I", "81:13", "don't have license to just call people", "81:15", "up randomly and say could I talk to you", "81:16", "for an hour I have a podcast and", "81:20", "suddenly you know people want to talk to", "81:22", "you right so I've gotten you know I", "81:25", "talked to Wynton Marsalis the the", "81:28", "trumpet player right you know the", "81:30", "grammy-winning trumpet player I talked", "81:32", "to Seth MacFarlane the other day I", "81:35", "plucked Nobel Prize winners MacArthur", "81:37", "prize winners philosophers biologists", "81:40", "documentary filmmakers it's I just", "81:42", "really have a blast", "81:43", "so yeah this podcasting thing I think is", "81:46", "gonna take off you should look into it", "81:47", "yeah it's well for me I mean there's no", "81:50", "way I would be able to get someone like", "81:52", "you sit down explain things like this", "81:54", "without a podcast well it is a it's", "81:57", "taking advantage I think right I mean", "82:00", "I'm not telling you this let's say we're", "82:01", "telling the audience this but it's it's", "82:04", "your", "82:06", "we can talk as long as we want right let", "82:08", "you take advantage of this better than", "82:09", "anybody and it's different it doesn't", "82:13", "replace things like books okay look like", "82:16", "books are always where you can get into", "82:18", "the weeds a little bit maybe a little", "82:19", "bit more specific a little bit more", "82:20", "careful but there's a long road you know", "82:23", "there's a lot of books out there I'm not", "82:25", "gonna read all of them that was the", "82:26", "other motivation behind starting my own", "82:28", "podcast is that I had a stack of books I", "82:29", "wanted to read and to force myself to", "82:31", "read them I would invite the author on", "82:33", "to the podcast but I can't read all", "82:37", "those books which books should I read", "82:39", "you know there's there's a whole you", "82:40", "know journey to saying oh like this is", "82:42", "important enough I should dedicate", "82:44", "myself to a week of my time to reading", "82:47", "this book and hearing people talk about", "82:49", "it in an informal setting is you know", "82:51", "both illuminating but also like oh yeah", "82:53", "there's ideas in there I really need to", "82:55", "get to so I'm a big believer in diverse", "82:57", "ecosystems I like Twitter I like little", "83:00", "YouTube videos I like podcasts I like", "83:02", "books I like talks there's all sorts of", "83:04", "ways to get this information yeah I", "83:05", "think it's opened up the interest in a", "83:08", "far broader group of human beings too", "83:12", "because in having conversations like", "83:14", "this with you or with you know the", "83:15", "hundreds of people that I get to talk to", "83:17", "in a regular basis it sparks ideas in", "83:20", "people that you know in their seemingly", "83:23", "mundane existence maybe just wouldn't", "83:25", "ever get in there and it allows these", "83:28", "new areas of inquiry in the new areas", "83:32", "for them personally to go look into and", "83:34", "I get messages and meet people all the", "83:37", "time I tell me how much it's changed the", "83:40", "way they view things because they've now", "83:42",
