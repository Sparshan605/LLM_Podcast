"with a great conversation for about 45", "79:35", "minutes to an hour and she said I want", "79:37", "this thing but you know you need an", "79:39", "agent and I was like what once he", "79:43", "negotiate yeah like the Pressfield thing", "79:45", "didn't say that in there and when I was", "79:46", "learning about the war of art and the", "79:48", "resistance and all that stuff we talked", "79:49", "about agents in there and I'm like oh no", "79:52", "how do I get one of those she's like all", "79:54", "right your guy I'll introduce you to", "79:57", "four and then just pick one okay so", "80:00", "interview four and how do you know who", "80:02", "the pick so it was crazy so there was", "80:04", "two two males two females they're all", "80:07", "fantastic all great reputations all", "80:10", "amazing the guys I was like it was very", "80:13", "obvious that it wasn't they would've", "80:16", "been great", "80:16", "hey you're not gonna think yeah I'm not", "80:18", "gonna make a wrong choice here so it was", "80:19", "in that sense I was very lucky but I", "80:22", "said okay they're probably not the right", "80:23", "ones but between the two females are", "80:25", "both so amazing but there are 180 out", "80:27", "from each other when I had been around", "80:29", "since the Tom Clancy days small boutique", "80:31", "agency represents John Grisham so you go", "80:34", "in there and you have all these John", "80:35", "Grisham posters all over the place the", "80:37", "whole team comes out sits down and talks", "80:39", "to you it was amazing she was so awesome", "80:41", "and and the other one younger hadn't", "80:44", "really hadn't found her Tom Clancy or", "80:46", "Grisham type person yet bigger agency", "80:49", "that also ICM it's out here in Hollywood", "80:52", "as well and it was such a tough decision", "80:54", "was like a final rose ceremony I haven't", "80:56", "broken up with someone in 20 years but I", "80:58", "felt like I was breaking you know for", "80:59", "someone but I was so invested in both of", "81:01", "these agents I just laid they were both", "81:02", "so fantastic but I felt like I was in", "81:04", "lanai at the time when I made the", "81:06", "decision and I was like and I felt like", "81:07", "the final rose ceremony and then pick", "81:09", "the one with ICM because I thought you", "81:11", "know for this type of a novel and for", "81:13", "where I wanted to go with a movie or", "81:14", "series or something like that to be that", "81:16", "part of them", "81:17", "then to continue building this", "81:18", "foundation of readers I think that's", "81:20", "probably the right choice and I think it", "81:22", "was so you have this plan to turn this", "81:24", "into some sort of a series from the time", "81:26", "you release the very first book yeah", "81:27", "from before that and so what's crazy is", "81:29", "that as I'm writing this now they tell", "81:30", "you not to think of someone playing your", "81:32", "characters your writing but as a child", "81:33", "of the 80s that's almost impossible not", "81:35", "to do so as I'm writing the crazy part", "81:38", "is like usually you think of like Mark", "81:39", "Wahlberg you think of somebody that had", "81:41", "done these sort of things kind of before", "81:42", "but I thought a Chris Pratt and he had", "81:45", "just done all he'd done it's Parks and", "81:46", "Rec and he'd done he had a small role in", "81:49", "zero dark thirty where he plays a seal", "81:51", "he has like a couple lines in there and", "81:53", "for some reason like that's the guy", "81:55", "really had no connection to him and no", "81:58", "it wouldn't been the obvious choice back", "82:00", "then this is 20 so I've start writing in", "82:02", "December of 2014 I think her early 2015", "82:05", "somewhere there so so he wasn't his", "82:06", "giant movie star back there hadn't done", "82:08", "any of that stuff yet and I thought you", "82:10", "know what this is a likable guy and he", "82:12", "seems like an awesome dude I'm getting a", "82:13", "good feeling from him and I thought you", "82:16", "know growing up in the 80s I love Magnum", "82:18", "he started off as a naval intelligence", "82:20", "officer and then they found out about", "82:21", "seals the writers they turned him into a", "82:22", "seal a couple seasons into it and like", "82:24", "everybody loved Magnum in the 80s and", "82:26", "women liked him the guys liked him you", "82:27", "know nothing not to like about Magnum", "82:29", "and he also does the first essentially", "82:32", "what you would call a murder on national", "82:35", "television with the other person not", "82:37", "having a firearm or a weapon and at the", "82:40", "end of I think it's season season three", "82:42", "but the guy a guy that had him as a powa", "82:45", "and Vietnam comes to Hawaii there's a", "82:46", "little conspiracy thing involved and at", "82:48", "the end he thinks he's walking away and", "82:50", "then Magnum asked him if he's seen the", "82:52", "Sun Rise that morning because that", "82:54", "morning when his friend his friend gets", "82:55", "killed there's a sunrise and the guy", "82:57", "turns around he's like yes why and the", "82:59", "magnet turns around and boom and they", "83:01", "stop it right there with this like", "83:02", "fireball coming out of the end of his", "83:03", "1911 and they freeze it right there and", "83:05", "it was the first time on television in", "83:08", "that primetime hour where someone had", "83:10", "killed somebody else the hero had killed", "83:12", "someone else who wasn't armed I forgot", "83:14", "about that very remembering it now it", "83:16", "was very controversial yeah yeah and", "83:19", "it's me so I thought that's who I need I", "83:21", "need somebody who's a likeable guy who's", "83:23", "going to invest in this and", "83:25", "I heard he was like pro-military and", "83:27", "that sort of thing and and because", "83:29", "perhaps the guy and that's all that's", "83:30", "all the thought I gave to it he couldn't", "83:31", "have picked a better job so awesome and", "83:33", "I get who knew he was gonna turn into", "83:36", "with Jurassic Park and he hadn't", "83:37", "passengers he hadn't anything serious", "83:39", "yet but I also thought about because", "83:41", "I've been studying this in something my", "83:42", "whole life and I thought about in the", "83:44", "80s", "83:45", "look what Tom Hanks did in the 80s you", "83:46", "know he's in booze and buddies he's in", "83:48", "dragnet he's in the burbs he's in jail", "83:50", "versus the volcano and then he does", "83:53", "something called Philadelphia in the", "83:54", "early 90s and he takes that risk and", "83:56", "since then he's been able to write his", "83:59", "own ticket he's one of the greatest", "84:00", "actors of his generation and I thought", "84:03", "who's that guy in this generation that", "84:05", "needs to stretch a little bit that needs", "84:06", "to do something different and I'm like", "84:08", "that's that's Chris Pratt he can do this", "84:10", "and so I thought it and then even", "84:12", "crazier before the first book came out I", "84:15", "met Thunder ranch training doing some", "84:16", "shooting stuff up there in Oregon and I", "84:18", "get this call from a guy that I knew in", "84:20", "the SEAL Teams and he's like hey bro do", "84:23", "you remember me and you know you know", "84:25", "Jarrod and I yeah he was out there and", "84:27", "Utah with us and he said hey bro you", "84:30", "remember me yeah of course I remember", "84:31", "you have to go ahead and talk to him in", "84:32", "five years or something and we catch up", "84:35", "a little bit and he's like hey you know", "84:37", "I was wondering thank you for a couple I", "84:39", "was leaving the SEAL Teams I don't know", "84:40", "if you're member but you've had me into", "84:41", "your office you sat me down he talked", "84:43", "about transition you introduced me some", "84:44", "people in the private sector and I've", "84:46", "never forgotten it I was like oh wow hey", "84:48", "of course I'm gonna do that for you", "84:49", "because I mean he's awesome too total", "84:50", "stud great operator and wants to get out", "84:52", "of the team so I'm gonna try to help him", "84:53", "as best I can but he really remembered", "84:56", "it and he said hey I heard you wrote a", "84:57", "book I said yeah it's coming out in a", "84:59", "couple months here they're these galley", "85:00", "copy things which are early copies of a", "85:02", "novel I can send one to you I'd love to", "85:03", "send it and he said yeah I'd love it", "85:05", "that'd be great but I'd like to give one", "85:06", "to a friend of mine and I said yeah no", "85:08", "problem who's that he said Chris Pratt", "85:09", "it's like no way Wow yeah so he gives us", "85:14", "the Chris Chris reads it and next thing", "85:16", "you know he's optioned it before it even", "85:17", "comes out are you a guy who believes in", "85:20", "fate do you believe in destiny so when I", "85:23", "was in Ramadi in 2005-2006", "85:25", "that's where I got to think about this a", "85:27", "little bit because every time you left", "85:29", "the wire anything could have been an iud", "85:31", "and you could have either spent that", "85:33", "time on the way to target and coming", "85:35", "back from Target worried about oh is", "85:37", "that is that dead donkey on the side", "85:38", "that is that gonna blow up and kill me", "85:41", "or kill that hit that Humvee in front of", "85:43", "me that piece of trash right there is", "85:45", "that covering something else is that it", "85:46", "is our wire there you could spend every", "85:48", "single mission especially you want to", "85:50", "and from Target and even on target", "85:51", "worried about that or you could focus on", "85:54", "the mission focus on the job get there", "85:57", "do the job get back and at that time I", "86:00", "was like you know you know I think I", "86:02", "have to resign myself to fate here and a", "86:04", "lot of these things otherwise my mind is", "86:06", "going to be focused not where it needs", "86:07", "to be but on is that night II is that", "86:09", "night II and so I thought all right you", "86:11", "know what if I get blown up today that's", "86:14", "just that's just how it was everything", "86:15", "everything we possibly can to mitigate", "86:16", "that but you know it could happen and", "86:19", "I'm not going to spend an inordinate", "86:21", "amount of bandwidth worried about that", "86:22", "other than trying to mitigate it as best", "86:24", "we possibly can but that's not going to", "86:26", "be the focus of my everything that I'm", "86:29", "thinking about it can't be I need to be", "86:30", "focused on this mission I need to focus", "86:31", "on contingencies there's a firefight I", "86:33", "need to figure out what assets are", "86:35", "available to come in here for QRF or", "86:37", "whatever else what here we have overhead", "86:38", "how do we how do we maneuver here all", "86:40", "those things like that's what I need to", "86:42", "worry what's a QR quick reaction force", "86:44", "so you have those set up at different", "86:45", "places in case you get hit so they can", "86:47", "come on and usually in like Bradley's or", "86:49", "abrams sometimes different vehicles and", "86:53", "have a little more firepower than you do", "86:54", "as you're sneaking through the streets", "86:56", "so so we're kind of resign myself to", "86:57", "fate and there's a book called the", "87:01", "bridge at San Liu array and there's like", "87:05", "I forget how many people will say five", "87:06", "or six people that are on this bridge", "87:07", "and it collapses and the story is how", "87:12", "each one of them got to be on that", "87:13", "bridge why were those six people the", "87:15", "ones that were on that bridge at that", "87:17", "time and its fate so so I guess then I'm", "87:22", "really thought about too much since then", "87:23", "other than that experience in in Iraq", "87:25", "and just having to feeling like I had to", "87:28", "resign myself to it there's perhaps", "87:31", "things eerie though it's crazy it's a", "87:32", "little eerie", "87:33", "I mean wonderfully eerie no eerie maybe", "87:36", "the worst word was pretty amazing I feel", "87:39", "very fortunate yeah and yeah it's one of", "87:42", "those things that you kind of maybe made", "87:44", "that happen like maybe you kind of put", "87:46", "that out there well as you were writing", "87:48", "it thinking about him maybe I don't know", "87:51", "I", "87:51", "see that I said shut up hippie it's like", "87:55", "Oh what do you got a crystal up your ass", "87:57", "too you know but that yeah no I hadn't", "88:00", "if I hadn't",

with other people", "97:06", "that had similar interests or that they", "97:08", "thought might be able to then grow the", "97:09", "brand and also help those other brands", "97:11", "along the way well it's also this it's", "97:13", "authentic like Evan really Oh Evan hey", "97:15", "for the CEO black raffle coffee has", "97:18", "always been a coffee freak yeah so alive", "97:20", "used to fucking roast coffee in the back", "97:24", "of his hummus amazing yeah he's great he", "97:28", "takes you through you sense that", "97:29", "passions when he talks about coffee it's", "97:30", "like me talking about writing you know", "97:33", "you can sense that passion and it's", "97:34", "incredibly from him now I'm turning into", "97:37", "more of a coffee snob like before I", "97:38", "wasn't but now that I know him and all", "97:39", "those guys and have seen the process and", "97:41", "now I'm a total coffee snob does he give", "97:43", "you a hard time because Reese likes", "97:45", "honey and a little bit cream in his", "97:47", "coffee not as much as I thought he would", "97:49", "because you know when he makes coffee", "97:51", "it's really good without anything in it", "97:52", "like when he does what he's doing and", "97:53", "they do that thing with a glass deal and", "97:55", "the whole thing it's only measures it", "97:57", "out yeah and they weigh it and the whole", "97:58", "thing it's awesome for me I mean getting", "98:01", "up in the morning it's chaos the kids", "98:02", "you know it's insanity and so we just", "98:05", "hit the coffee maker like rival coffees", "98:06", "in there and I toss in some honey toffee", "98:08", "sauce and some cream so that's you give", "98:15", "you shit about putting honey in your", "98:17", "coffee yes so much just like the", "98:20", "protagonist of these stories they they", "98:21", "like the coffee black well in real life", "98:23", "a lot of seals and Special Forces guys", "98:25", "like their coffee black also they like", "98:26", "to suffer and yeah but I always liked", "98:29", "you know that latte I can get that", "98:30", "caramel macchiato latte so I always I", "98:32", "always did that and then I found out", "98:34", "about honey and coffee and honey and tea", "98:36", "later but it just was very natural for", "98:38", "me to write that into the character", "98:40", "because he has a background similar to", "98:41", "to me as a former Navy SEAL sniper it", "98:43", "becomes an officer and he's got this", "98:45", "point in his time in uniform where he's", "98:46", "gonna get out and take care of his", "98:47", "family which is where I was when I", "98:49", "started right", "98:49", "so I learned him to be relatable I", "98:51", "didn't want him to be a superhero I", "98:53", "wanted her to be someone that wasn't was", "98:54", "good at some things like kicking in", "98:55", "doors like the taking sniper shot some", "98:58", "of the things that I'm okay at but then", "98:59", "also surveillance side of the house some", "99:01", "of the things that we don't typically do", "99:02", "in the SEAL team he's not as good at", "99:04", "those sorts of things and maybe he", "99:06", "drives a fj6 to Land Cruiser because I", "99:08", "love Land Cruisers and there's also you", "99:10", "know that whole subculture of people", "99:11", "that love Land Cruisers yeah I can bring", "99:13", "into the fold also so it's very natural", "99:15", "for me to talk about those vehicles and", "99:17", "then develop characters by talking about", "99:20", "a defender 110 Land Cruiser I'll give", "99:23", "each other a hard time whatever else or", "99:24", "nine bill moyers 45 or whatever just use", "99:27", "those things as character development", "99:29", "tools so it was very natural for me to", "99:30", "add honey and cream to protagonist", "99:32", "coffee because that's what I drink at", "99:34", "home a daily that's got to be the", "99:36", "interesting one of one of the many many", "99:38", "interesting things about writing a", "99:39", "character is that you can incorporate", "99:42", "your own little quirks and the Resco", "99:45", "watches all the different stuff that", "99:50", "you're you mean and the the gear thing", "99:53", "too it's like you're very meticulous and", "99:55", "very specific about the type of gear and", "99:58", "and how he prepares everything you happy", "100:01", "very very odd for me not to do that and", "100:03", "some people don't like it and there are", "100:05", "plenty of books where someone takes the", "100:07", "safety off on their Glock before they", "100:09", "shoot someone or something like that or", "100:10", "they click it off on a revolver or", "100:12", "whatever like there's plenty books out", "100:13", "there that do that and you know I won't", "100:15", "making a mistake that egregious I'm sure", "100:17", "I'll make a mistake at some point for", "100:18", "the people that really but when you see", "100:19", "a mistake like that doesn't it take you", "100:21", "out a little bit it's like watching a", "100:25", "movie where they really kind of jack", "100:26", "something up and I'm like because the", "100:28", "worst thing to do is watch out like a", "100:29", "seal movie with a seal or like a police", "100:33", "movie with a cop or whatever that's all", "100:35", "gonna tell you about all the mistakes so", "100:36", "you can't enjoy the film so I try to", "100:38", "just enjoy them for what they are but it", "100:40", "does take you out he just like what else", "100:42", "did they get kind of not right at the", "100:43", "guys like writing the safety off on this", "100:45", "clock so so for me it's very natural to", "100:49", "incorporate that gear and it's also very", "100:51", "natural for me to talk about it because", "100:52", "I was so into it for so long that I know", "100:55", "a lot of people in these industries and", "100:57", "like this is an Aries watch right here I", "100:58", "was at the cia's friends with Evan haver", "101:00", "you know so I've talked to happen be", "101:02", "okay", "101:02", "this dude legit he's like oh yeah he's", "101:04", "legit so so like all that stuff gets", "101:06", "woven in there as well it's just so", "101:08", "natural for me to do and also you know", "101:09", "when I see somebody I can tell a lot", "101:11", "about them by what they're carrying how", "101:13", "they're carrying it you know what kind", "101:15", "of belt they're they're using what kind", "101:16", "she was they're wearing what kind of", "101:18", "knife is in their pocket like I can tell", "101:20", "a lot about them it tells a story", "101:21", "immediately so I'm reading them without", "101:23", "them saying one word and so my", "101:26", "characters do that as well and then I", "101:28", "use those tools to describe other", "101:30", "characters that that aren't me that", "101:32", "aren't a seal that aren't somebody else", "101:34", "well I know how SF guys travel or now", "101:37", "they have they do have their packs or", "101:39", "whatever and F wherever it is or I know", "101:41", "someone that doesn't really know what", "101:42", "they're doing this character doesn't", "101:43", "really know what they're doing so yeah", "101:45", "he's gonna be carrying this 1911 that's", "101:46", "brand new that he's not carrying cocked", "101:48", "and locked doesn't have one of the", "101:49", "chamber whatever it is like I can tell a", "101:51", "lot about someone just by looking at", "101:52", "their setup with a quick glance so it's", "101:54", "very natural for me to do that in", "101:55", "stories as well and it gives me a lot to", "101:57", "work with how many how many seals are", "101:59", "novelists it's not common there are", "102:03", "seals obviously who get out and write", "102:04", "nonfiction yeah Richard Marcinko who", "102:08", "created Marcinko I read the first books", "102:11", "that I ever read on military and oh nice", "102:13", "nice yeah early nineties and when that", "102:15", "came out I was so excited because I had", "102:16", "read everything you possibly could on", "102:18", "seals up until that point because I", "102:20", "wanted to be a CEO since I was seven", "102:21", "years old I knew I was gonna be in the", "102:22", "military even before that books come out", "102:24",

would", "113:56", "come out of out of Iraq they had all", "113:58", "these metal over all the windows it cut", "114:01", "off all the ladders on the ship so you'd", "114:03", "have to use a caving

clearances", "116:28", "that I had no one else submits fiction", "116:29", "but I was so I just tied to this because", "116:32", "of my experience with the Mark Owen book", "116:34", "and when they tried to do I was like I", "116:35", "just want to make sure right and I said", "116:37", "what they've taken out absolutely", "116:39", "ridiculous so the first book I didn't", "116:41", "appeal it

& Schuster for some reason and a", "123:12", "lot of its what happened downrange and", "123:14", "those feelings and emotions but a lot of", "123:15", "it is because of what happened with with", "123:17", "you as I was getting now that's", "123:19", "interesting so now when you create these", "123:22", "characters do you write a backstory do", "123:25", "you spend time like writing out this", "123:28", "guy's life and then sort of use pieces", "123:31", "of that in the story or do you write it", "123:33", "along while you're writing the story", "123:35", "because he was had a background so", "123:37", "similar at mine I didn't need to do that", "123:39", "so I didn't need to create so now I am", "123:42", "for this fourth one because now there's", "123:43", "so many characters that it's hard to", "123:45", "keep spelling straight and background", "123:46", "straight and all that sort of things so", "123:48", "now I have these family trees and these", "123:49", "characters written out on Scrivener", "123:51", "which is how I write it yeah so good to", "123:56", "organize things and left so CLE hit that", "123:58", "button it's all turns into like a poster", "124:00", "board type thing but I didn't use that", "124:03", "one until the third one up until that", "124:05", "point I was using word and like copying", "124:06", "and pasting and then scrolling and then", "124:08", "putting it in where I wanted and then", "124:10", "you know maybe I didn't cut because I he", "124:11", "was worried I was gonna delete and then", "124:13", "I go back and now delete it so it's so", "124:14", "nice to use Scrivener like that just", "124:16", "makes it so much easier to do that so so", "124:18", "now I do but at the beginning I didn't", "124:20", "with one novel and kind of creating you", "124:22", "have the story so I did that I wrote six", "124:24", "or seven different ideas down like one", "124:26", "page executive summaries as I was", "124:28", "getting ready the one I wanted to start", "124:29", "with was savage Sun that was the one I", "124:31", "wanted to start with really but I knew", "124:33", "the characters weren't quite at that", "124:34", "place where I could explore the dark", "124:36", "side of man I needed to get readers", "124:38", "invested in them take him on a journey", "124:40", "much like I learned about Joseph", "124:42", "Campbell and the hero's journey and here", "124:44", "with a thousand faces back in 1988 I had", "124:46", "to take him on that sort of a journey", "124:48", "and get him to that point where I could", "124:50", "explore the dark side of man through", "124:52", "these characters so so let's had to", "124:54", "start with that that first one it was", "124:56", "very evident it's gonna be the terminal", "124:58", "list that's the one so I took that one", "125:00", "page executive summary turned into an", "125:01", "outline but if I came to a point in that", "125:03", "outline where I got stuck and this is", "125:05", "the important part I didn't say uh-huh", "125:07", "and readers aren't gonna figure this out", "125:09", "they're not gonna come along on me with", "125:10", "this journey", "125:11", "believable I just went around it because", "125:13", "I'm not on the battlefield I'm solving", "125:15", "problems on the page like I am I'm", "125:17", "adapting like I am on the battlefield", "125:19", "but you know what I can sleep on it and", "125:20", "I don't have to solve this problem right", "125:22", "now I can get five months down the line", "125:24", "and just continue going and eventually", "125:26", "I'm gonna figure this problem out and", "125:28", "it's gonna work out so I didn't let", "125:29", "anything any obstacle stop me as I was", "125:31", "writing that outline and I took that", "125:33", "outline and started writing and as I", "125:35", "figured out those problems then I would", "125:37", "change the outline and I would adapt it", "125:38", "so I could have a visual representation", "125:40", "of what was going on and then eventually", "125:42", "about the 75% point then I just", "125:44", "discarded the outline completely and", "125:45", "just kept writing so Scrivener made that", "125:48", "a ton easier for the third book because", "125:51", "doing it in Word was a pain there is", "125:53", "apparently a way that you could set up", "125:54", "word to behave like Scrivener oh really", "125:57", "yeah I read an article on it and I tried", "126:00", "to do it and I was like I fucking give", "126:02", "up just gonna up using Scrivener I just", "126:04", "love how word I write bits in word", "126:08", "because I can get it on my phone I can", "126:11", "get it on a computer just log into", "126:12", "Microsoft Word and it just shows me all", "126:14", "the files any laptop any computer I use", "126:17", "any phone I use it just goes right to it", "126:19", "where it's like with Scrivener you have", "126:21", "to like upload it to Dropbox and then to", "126:25", "get it from drop was a little that's a", "126:27", "banner and then when I send it to the", "126:29", "editor I did that thing were changes it", "126:31", "to word and then I'm in word the rest of", "126:33", "the time no Mac described after I did", "126:35", "that was the finished product yeah as", "126:37", "finishes it could be any what else has", "126:38", "changed from the time you wrote your", "126:41", "first book to now in terms of like your", "126:43", "process and and and how you do it and", "126:45", "what do you think you're better at now", "126:47", "than you were when you started", "126:49", "so the timeline is obviously compressed", "126:52", "now so I started writing the second one", "126:53", "before I'd even submitted the first one", "126:55", "to Simon & Schuster because I was always", "126:56", "gonna write those two because of that", "126:57", "John Grisham story and him not being", "126:59", "able to give a time to kill away so I", "127:00", "was always gonna write too so I was", "127:01", "already in Mozambique I was already", "127:03", "doing that that research over there", "127:04", "already writing that second one and if", "127:06", "both of them didn't work out then I was", "127:08", "gonna reevaluate my life choices but I", "127:09", "was always gonna go all-in on - so now", "127:13", "so point being for the second one I", "127:15", "wasn't yet on that year timeline because", "127:18", "there was no deal hadn't even gone to", "127:20", "Simon and Schuster and then once the", "127:21", "first one did get to Simon & Schuster", "127:23", "then they plotted it out and I", "127:24", "still had another over a year before I", "127:26", "came out while I'm working on the other", "127:28", "one so this third one is the first one", "127:30", "that I've had but to be on that year", "127:32", "long time line for but I've had it in my", "127:35", "head for so long so this fourth one now", "127:37", "is the one where things are really", "127:39", "compressed because especially because of", "127:41", "copa90 and having to adapt at the last", "127:43", "second for this book tour and having to", "127:45", "think of things that I wouldn't", "127:46", "necessarily have thought had to think of", "127:48", "otherwise like helping these independent", "127:50", "bookstores

find that", "156:44", "now that you're a prominent voice in the", "156:47", "world of fiction authors and the fact", "156:49", "that your your your novels have a lot to", "156:53", "do with like real

resonated", "157:43", "with Simon & Schuster is because it's", "157:45", "thoughtful violence that's how I think", "157:46", "of it it's not just shoots the guy than", "157:48", "E or whatever it's

some good ones I won't", "157:59", "come with that to be a kind of homework", "158:01", "of this series is that there are things", "158:02", "that people haven't seen before and it's", "158:03", "not just extra violence it's thoughtful", "158:05", "violence so I don't worry about", "158:08", "alienating it's it's more about me being", "158:11", "honest because people can tell like if", "158:13",

didn't have", "164:54", "to worry about whether I'm just telling", "164:56", "them something just because I think", "164:57", "that's what they want to hear where I'm", "164:59", "looking to get ahead
