a", "11:22", "precision art form that requires", "11:25", "calculation and also zen-like smoothness", "11:29", "and alpha flow you got to be in the zone", "11:32", "you got to be in that flow state yep you", "11:34", "got to be happy you know Charles got to", "11:36", "be focused yeah I'll be having a good", "11:38", "time but concentrating on these people", "11:40", "and and projecting to them

was their fault", "12:15", "our imagine feel like one of those big", "12:17", "tobacco guys you're driving around Rolls", "12:19", "Royce knowing that someone's on an iron", "12:21", "lung somewhere yeah know what someone's", "12:26", "drowning in their own fluid it's like", "12:38", "it's bull fighting yeah that's what we", "12:41", "do it's what you said it so well he's", "12:43", "like because people used to always make", "12:45", "the boxing analogy and I hated that", "12:46", "because I used to box a little bit and", "12:48", "like I never at all felt that it was", "12:52", "similar like I've never heard a boxer go", "12:54", "yeah this is just like stand-up it is", "12:56", "like a martial art in that the truth is", "13:00", "what works go on that because in martial", "13:04", "arts if you like the in particularly in", "13:07", "martial arts", "13:09", "not just in boxing boxing is a martial", "13:11", "art but the only stuff that works is the", "13:13", "stuff that works and if you hit a guy", "13:15", "he goes unconscious it doesn't matter", "13:16", "one of the things that I used to like", "13:17", "about fighting was that everybody could", "13:19", "hate me and I didn't care I didn't care", "13:22", "because when I got in there yeah I'm", "13:24", "like I knew that I was gonna fuck that", "13:26", "guy up it doesn't matter what his", "13:28", "friends think doesn't matter how well", "13:30", "loved his parents cheer yeah I'm gonna", "13:32", "kick that dude in his head and I'm gonna", "13:33", "separate him from his consciousness", "13:35", "meritocrat that just gonna happen yeah", "13:37", "and there's nothing and you could hate", "13:38", "me all day long it doesn't matter but", "13:40", "then I had to switch gears a hundred", "13:42", "percent in the comedy and I thought they", "13:43", "were so different and then I realized", "13:45", "because in comedy you have to get the", "13:47", "people to like you right you can't just", "13:49", "have these ideas and be unlikable can't", "13:51", "you get them to respect you yeah", "13:54", "but they gotta like you I mean you can", "13:56", "get them to respect even respect its", "13:58", "liking you like do you have to be", "13:59", "someone could say one thing like there's", "14:02", "like the late great Brody Stevens who", "14:04", "just passed yeah if you looked at", "14:05", "Brody's material on paper some of it", "14:09", "wasn't funny and when you looked at it", "14:11", "in real life it was some of my best", "14:13", "material that I ever saw anybody do", "14:15", "right because Brody's personality was so", "14:18", "likable he was funny on stage that you", "14:21", "just wanted to laugh at him it just he", "14:24", "figured out authenticity yeah it's yeah", "14:27", "and when I was starting out I didn't", "14:28", "have that I was I couldn't I didn't I", "14:31", "had a hard time making that switch then", "14:33", "once I get better it's I got better at", "14:35", "stand-up I realized I go there's it's so", "14:37", "similar because either it's funny or", "14:39", "it's not funny take either it works or", "14:42", "doesn't work and your job is not like", "14:45", "some comics get they get caught up in", "14:47", "their image they get caught up in how", "14:50", "they want the audience to think of them", "14:51", "yep yeah and they dress a certain way on", "14:53", "purpose because they want to project", "14:55", "this image and they'll even say things", "14:57", "on stage that are kind of gross you know", "14:59", "that they're only saying it because they", "15:01", "want the audience to think they're cool", "15:02", "all right and it gives you a little like", "15:04", "you but maybe they're good enough so", "15:06", "that you see laughs not everybody yeah", "15:08", "say it is authenticity illuminates all", "15:11", "those comments can't follow a real comic", "15:13", "right never notices like when you see", "15:16", "someone who's being truthful he might", "15:18", "not even be as funny he might not be", "15:21", "killing as hard but it's so authentic", "15:23", "that when the comic comes next it feels", "15:26", "like they're reading jokes off a paper", "15:28", "right", "15:29", "right and it's our bodies are keyed into", "15:32", "like comedies reptilian if you do it", "15:34", "right right you know like a lot of times", "15:36", "people ask like why like old women can", "15:38", "laugh at the same jokes that I'm telling", "15:40", "that like these young people can laugh", "15:42", "at and then my response is always it's", "15:44", "not their choice like I'm not telling", "15:46", "you jokes to your choice like The Daily", "15:48", "Show Trevor Noah is jokes about how you", "15:50", "want the world to be right I'm telling", "15:53", "you jokes about how you deep down via is", "15:56", "going at your gut it's reptile shit", "15:59", "yeah so it's like if it's in here", "16:01", "already right you're gonna laugh
