you", "01:56", "have a particle and it could be in one", "01:58", "spot or it could be in another spot then", "02:02", "you have all sorts of states where it", "02:03", "can be in both places at once

two", "02:13", "to illustrate it could be in one spot or", "02:15", "in the other and my mind sort of", "02:19", "wandered at that point I don't know what", "02:20", "I was thinking about but I

other", "02:59", "course was a course by a man called", "03:01", "Steen who talked on mathematical logic", "03:04", "and he explained things like girdle's", "03:07", "theorem and Turing machines

that there were things in", "03:48", "mathematics that you just couldn't prove", "03:51", "and I didn't like that idea but I when I", "03:54", "heard the when I went to this course", "03:57",

these rules you know they could", "04:50", "be adding a and B it's the same as B and", "04:53", "a and things like that and you if you", "04:58", "give your you say to the computer say", "05:02",

give it to the computer and it", "05:13", "says yep you've done it right it's true", "05:15", "or maybe it will say you've done it", "05:18", "right and it's not true or it may not", "05:20", "say anything but just go on forever but", "05:21", "these are the sort of outcomes and the", "05:24", "point about it is that if you believe", "05:26", "that these procedures do give you a", "05:29", "proof in other words that if the", "05:32", "algorithm says yeah it's true then you", "05:36", "believe it it is true because you've", "05:37", "understood all the rules you looked at", "05:39", "the first one say yeah yeah that's okay", "05:41", "you little the second one said ma'am", "05:43", "oh yeah I see okay that's great and you", "05:45", "go all the way down and as long as", "05:47",

a scheme", "06:36", "which you could put on a computer that", "06:38", "you see this statement which girl comes", "06:40", "up with is something you can see on the", "06:43", "basis of the same

your belief in the rules", "06:58", "and this to me was amazing", "07:01", "and I thought golly you know what's", "07:04", "understanding what does it mean is it", "07:07", "something following rules this is an", "07:10", "algorithm well this more or less says", "07:11", "it's not an algorithm because whatever", "07:13", "it was there would be something that you", "07:15", "could still see is true even though you", "07:18", "don't get it through the algorithm that", "07:19", "you had in the first place so this was a", "07:22", "bit alot of subtleties about this to", "07:24", "which people argue about endlessly but", "07:26", "it was pretty convincing to me that this", "07:29", "shows that we don't think when we", "07:32", "understand something that what's going", "07:33", "on in our heads is not an algorithm it's", "07:37", "not following rules it's something else", "07:40", "it's something that requires our", "07:41", "conscious appreciation of what we're", "07:45", "thinking about I'm thinking is a", "07:47", "conscious thing and understanding is a", "07:51", "conscious activity so I form the view", "07:53", "that conscious activities whatever they", "07:56", "are not just that

going on and then I", "08:07", "thought because I you know I'm like to", "08:10", "think myself as a scientist and I think", "08:12", "that what's going in on our heads is", "08:14", "according to the laws of physics and", "08:16", "these laws of physics pretty good they", "08:20", "seem to work well in outside world and", "08:23", "so I believe that the laws that work in", "08:26", "our heads are the same as those laws so", "08:29", "I began to think about it well what", "08:30", "about Newton's mechanics well you could", "08:33", "put that on a computer what about", "08:36", "Einstein's

to worry about", "08:55", "approximations and the least depend on", "08:57", "continuous numbers rather discrete", "08:59", "things but I didn't think that's the", "09:01", "answer then I thought what about general", "09:03", "relativity Einstein's theory of gravity", "09:07", "with curved space and all that", "09:09", "well we're familiar now with LIGO this", "09:11", "detector which is detected

people have put this", "09:22", "thing on an algorithm and you know what", "09:24", "those signals look like so Einstein's", "09:27", "general relativity sure you can put that", "09:29", "in a common of computer what about", "09:31", "quantum mechanics well there's the", "09:33", "famous equation of Schrodinger which", "09:36", "tells you how a quantum state evolves", "09:39", "you could put that

well you see I then", "09:51", "remembered Eric's lecture you see and", "09:54", "how it is that these things that work in", "09:57", "the quantum world don't seem to work at", "10:01", "the level of classical big things and it", "10:05", "all depends on this process of what's", "10:07", "called measurements in quantum mechanics", "10:09", "and the measurement process is something", "10:12", "you learn how to do but it's not the", "10:15", "Schrodinger equation it's something else", "10:17", "and Schrodinger himself was very", "10:20", "intrigued by this facts that his own", "10:23", "equation gives you nonsense and you the", "10:27", "famous Schrodinger's cat where he", "10:29", "produces a situation in which the cat", "10:31", "would be dead and alive at the same time", "10:32", "he produced that an example simply to", "10:36", "demonstrate that roughly speaking his", "10:38", "equation gives you nonsense under these", "10:41", "circumstances so there's something else", "10:43", "and something else goes beyond our", "10:46", "current quantum mechanics and it tells", "10:49", "you what happens when the quantum state", "10:51", "makes a decision between but it doesn't", "10:54", "follow the", "10:54", "requested one thing or the other no", "10:56", "everybody knows that who does quantum", "10:58", "mechanics but they think oh it's what's", "11:00", "called making a measurement and you're", "11:01", "larger to something different but that", "11:03", "didn't make sense to me and so I had the", "11:06", "view that okay there is a big gap in our", "11:09", "understanding and if there is something", "11:12", "in the world which isn't something you", "11:14", "could put on a computer that's where it", "11:16", "is so the view I've held that for a long", "11:19", "time and that there's something non", "11:23", "computable something beyond computation", "11:26", "involved in our understandings of things", "11:29", "so that's a view of Health for ages I", "11:31", "didn't do much with it I just held the", "11:33", "view until I think there was a radio", "11:37", "talk between Marvin Minsky and edward", "11:39", "fredkin and they were explaining about", "11:41", "what computers can do and they were", "11:43", "talking about okay you have a computer", "11:45", "two computers talking to each other over", "11:47", "there and you walk up to the room and", "11:49", "the time you've walked up the room to", "11:50", "the computers they have computed", "11:52", "commuted communicated with each other", "11:55", "more thoughts than the human race ever", "11:58", "has done you see and I thought well I", "12:00", "see where you're coming from but I don't", "12:02", "think that's what's happening in human", "12:05", "communication human understanding is", "12:08", "something different from what computers", "12:10", "do and consciousness is the key thing", "12:12", "consciousness is something different", "12:14", "from computation so I've held that view", "12:17", "but then when I heard this stop by", "12:19", "Minsky and in fredkin I thought well I", "12:23", "had ideas of writing a book sometime you", "12:26", "know a long time in the future when I'm", "12:27", "retired this was some while back I say", "12:29", "and I thought well maybe this gives you", "12:32", "the focus and so I wrote this book", "12:34", "called the emperor's new mind which was", "12:37", "supposed to be saying well you know we", "12:41", "everybody seems to be thinking one thing", "12:43", "but yeah little kid notices it let the", "12:46", "Emperor it doesn't have any clothes so", "12:48", "it was the that theme of that story", "12:51", "which was the basis of the book so I say", "12:54", "okay maybe a lots of people think that", "12:56", "what we're doing is computing but if you", "12:59", "stand back and you say well no there's", "13:02", "something else going on", "13:04", "so that was the basis of my thoughts", "13:07", "about consciousness but I wrote this", "13:10", "book thinking that by the time I got to", "13:13", "the end of the book you see it was it", "13:14", "was a lot mostly about physics and", "13:16", "mathematics and things like that but I", "13:18", "was really aiming for this thing about", "13:20", "what's going on and conscious thinking", "13:22", "and I thought well I'll learn a bit", "13:23", "about neurophysiology and so on and by", "13:26", "the time I get to the end of the book", "13:27", "know pretty well what it could be I", "13:30", "didn't know it's the end of a book and I", "13:33", "just sort of tapered off rather with", "13:35", "something a little bit unbelievable and", "13:37", "that was the end now you see I'd hoped", "13:39", "that this book would stimulate young", "13:42", "people to get interested in science and", "13:45", "that sort of thing that mathematics oh", "13:46", "that was fine and when the book was", "13:49", "published I didn't get letters from", "13:50", "young kids I got letters from old", "13:53", "retired people who the ones who had the", "13:56", "time to read my book okay well that was", "13:59", "a little disappointing but okay", "14:00", "I'm glad the old retired people liked my", "14:02", "book but the other thing was I got a", "14:05", "letter from Stuart Hameroff and this", "14:07", "letter said more or less I think you", "14:10", "don't appreciate that there's something", "14:12", "else going on not neurons I mean the", "14:14", "neurons I could see you couldn't isolate", "14:16", "the quantum effects and you get the", "14:20", "what's called environmental decoherence", "14:22", "would happen and you get no way of", "14:24", "keeping the quantum state to the level", "14:26", "that you need in this picture so I", "14:29", "realize didn't have it but Stuart", "14:32", "Hameroff pointed out to me these little", "14:34", "things called microtubules and he'd", "14:36", "built up a theory that microtubules were", "14:40", "absolutely fundamental to consciousness", "14:42", "he had his own reasons for believing", "14:43", "that I'd never heard of him at that time", "14:45", "but then I checked up you know I get", "14:48", "lots of letters from people who maybe", "14:50", "don't make sense sometimes the letters", "14:52", "and this one I thought well is this", "14:54", "another one I realized these", "14:57", "microtubules are there and they looked", "15:00", "like just the kind of thing that could", "15:01", "well be supporting the kind of level of", "15:05", "quantum mechanics up to a level where", "15:07", "you you could expect the the quantum", "15:10", "state sort of collapse that's the", "15:12", "terminology people using quantum", "15:14", "microtubules they are inside brain", "15:16", "neurons", "15:17", "and this is a recent discovery from", "15:19", "those only to be there actually in lots", "15:22", "of cells you see people often complain", "15:23", "oh they're in your liver too not just", "15:25", "your brain so why doesn't your liver", "15:27", "conscious and all that but this has to", "15:28", "do with the organization of them and the", "15:30", "nature of them the particular kind of", "15:32", "microtubules how they're arranged which", "15:35", "is different in the brain how does it", "15:37", "vary in the brain compared to other", "15:38", "cells I think one big difference other", "15:41", "not Stuart emphasizes is so much there", "15:43", "are two kinds of microtubules they're", "15:45", "the ones called a lattice and the B", "15:47", "lattice and the a lattice ones are the", "15:49", "very symmetrical ones they're tubes and", "15:51", "they look the same all the way around", "15:52", "they've got a very beautiful arrangement", "15:55", "of these proteins called tubulin and", "15:57", "they make a very nice arrangement which", "16:00", "is connected with Fibonacci numbers and", "16:02", "things like that so they look bit like", "16:05",

"16:35", "the idea is that in the brain they're", "16:38", "organized differently and the probably", "16:41", "the ones that are important of a lattice", "16:43", "once which is a very symmetrical ones", "16:44", "and for a long time people couldn't see", "16:47", "the difference and because they looked", "16:49", "very similar and they may well be the", "16:52", "ones that's happened to be in pyramidal", "16:54", "cells as a particular kind of cell so", "16:58", "you know one of the things interested in", "17:01", "me a lot is how it is that not all parts", "17:03", "of the brain are the same in this", "17:05", "respect you see you've got the cerebrum", "17:07", "this is the part at the top and you know", "17:09", "divided down the middle and that when", "17:11", "you see brains that's what you normally", "17:12", "see with the convolutions and in the", "17:15", "init but right underneath and at the", "17:17", "back there's a thing called the", "17:18", "cerebellum which more looks more like a", "17:20", "like a ball of wool or something and the", "17:24", "cerebellum and it may still be argument", "17:27", "about this but it seems to be that it's", "17:29", "completely unconscious", "17:31", "and it has comparable number of neurons", "17:33", "far more connections between neurons in", "17:36", "the cerebrum and it's what takes control", "17:39", "and maybe when you're driving your car", "17:41", "and you're thinking about something else", "17:42", "and you you don't you're not thinking", "17:44", "what you're doing because it's", "17:46", "unconscious and

control is done somewhere", "18:05", "else in the cerebellum when you get", "18:07", "really skilled so it seemed to me okay", "18:11", "you've got different kinds of structures", "18:12", "different and it could well be that", "18:15", "these pyramidal cells which have a", "18:16", "particular organization of microtubules", "18:19", "are the ones that wear that", "18:21", "consciousness is really

they went back and joined to", "26:16", "the the roof that they were now what", "26:18", "does that tell us there's something", "26:19", "going on which is not just some machine", "26:22", "behaving yes like a robot there's some", "26:26", "some feelings there we can appreciate", "26:29", "I'm another one I remember was one with", "26:32", "these African hunting dogs and the dogs", "26:36", "you see there's a road where some", "26:39", "antelopes would tend to go and they're", "26:40", "to go across the river and when they got", "26:42", "to the point with the cross though it", "26:43", "might slow down and and make their way", "26:45", "to get across now these hunting dogs you", "26:48", "could see them I think it was taken from", "26:50", "the air and they would go along towards", "26:52", "this place where the river was and then", "26:54", "they would break into two so half of", "26:57", "them would go one way towards thick and", "26:59", "they were hide just where the river", "27:01", "starts and the other half but go and", "27:03", "chase the antelopes they've gone bark", "27:04", "and make an awful noise chase them right", "27:06", "there and then the other ones were", "27:08", "pounce on them I mean there's something", "27:10", "there which is you know that they've", "27:13", "been working it down between themselves", "27:14", "how to do is compute communication of", "27:17", "some kind yes and I think there is what", "27:21", "will you call understanding okay mmm at", "27:24", "a more primitive level and then human", "27:26", "understanding but nevertheless there is", "27:28", "something there's no sort of clean", "27:31", "dividing line in my view it's it's it's", "27:33", "pretty continuous yeah and this exists", "27:36", "in wolves as well so very very similar", "27:38", "behavior and they do seem to have not", "27:42", "just verbal but nonverbal communication", "27:44", "they seem to have some understanding of", "27:45", "what the task is uh-huh and what their", "27:48", "roles are in the task and even though", "27:51", "there's not as many variables maybe as", "27:53", "human life there definitely seems to be", "27:56", "a conscious

this is not a selfish", "28:08", "objective it's a group objective and", "28:10", "they operate as a group and they do move", "28:13", "like those African dogs you were talking", "28:14", "about yeah", "28:15", "no it's fascinating like that yeah and", "28:18", "there's a lot of indication that we're", "28:21", "certainly chimps and humans and things", "28:23", "and dolphins you we know about them but", "28:25", "ice imagine it goes", "28:27", "quite far down I should think how much", "28:28", "have you studied octopi they're", "28:31", "fascinating yeah", "28:32", "yes no I haven't there's a new book", "28:34", "about them which I haven't got the", "28:35", "chance to read yet I want to read it I", "28:37", "think they're they're highly intelligent", "28:39", "yes yes yeah I've been really paying", "28:42", "attention to them for a few years I'm a", "28:44", "good friend my friend Remy Warren was", "28:46", "doing a television show called", "28:49", "apex predator we studied the way", "28:51", "different animals hunted and he started", "28:54", "studying the way octopus and cuttlefish", "28:58", "and all these different yeah", "29:00", "the different octopi and what the way", "29:04", "they could adapt to their environment by", "29:06", "changing their actual not just to look", "29:08", "but the texture of their skin", "29:10", "instantaneously and how this is not", "29:12", "really understood how they not only how", "29:14", "they do it but how they know what", "29:17", "they're what's below them what they're", "29:19", "copying yes that they somehow or another", "29:21", "can figure out how to blend in almost", "29:24", "perfectly with their environment it's", "29:25", "amazing isn't it they also can open jars", "29:28", "and they cannot climb out of tanks there", "29:30", "was one guy had a he had a camera on his", "29:34", "tank because he had two tanks yes and", "29:36", "one of them had very expensive tropical", "29:39", "fish and the other one had his octopus", "29:40", "and he was trying to figure out what was", "29:42", "happening to his expensive tropical fish", "29:44", "so he put a camera on it and the octopus", "29:47", "was climbing out of the tank walking", "29:49", "across the ground climbing into the", "29:51", "other tank killing one of the fish", "29:52", "eating it and then going back into his", "29:54", "cave yes yeah that's heavy", "29:57", "well there's one I saw about I think I", "30:00", "heard the description or I read it I", "30:02", "think I read it about there were some", "30:04", "experiments on testing the intelligence", "30:06", "of octopuses oh and they had a little", "30:09", "thing they had to pull a chain and then", "30:11", "open a door and get food out and this", "30:14", "octopus was thinking that I'm gonna fed", "30:16", "up with this thing and so yank the chain", "30:17", "it came right off and then it rose to", "30:19", "the top and started squirting all the", "30:21", "people in their white coats I know it", "30:25", "was pretty good do you know there's", "30:26", "something else going on than just there", "30:28", "is something going on absolutely now", "30:30", "when you if you weren't pressed for to", "30:34", "figure this out and some sort of a", "30:37", "a paper that you had to display in front", "30:40", "of scientists if you were you were like", "30:41", "you're trying to figure out like what do", "30:43", "you think it is like what did what do", "30:46", "you think consciousness is well you see", "30:49", "how I I mean - it's going to fart I", "30:52", "think you know I know whether or the", "30:54", "answer isn't anything I just I just", "30:55", "think that this issue of having some", "30:59", "kind of quantum state which preserves", "31:02", "itself up to a certain level and the", "31:04", "microtubules at least suggested", "31:07", "something where you could isolate them", "31:09", "from the outside and the symmetry of", "31:11", "these things is important and there are", "31:13", "other structures I suspect it's not just", "31:16", "microtubules I suspect there are these", "31:19", "in classrooms these are molecules which", "31:24", "inhabit these synapses and and the thing", "31:29", "about these ones is that they're", "31:31", "incredibly symmetrical they're like a", "31:32", "soccer ball you know they're you have", "31:35", "these Pentagon's and hexagons and at", "31:37", "each vertex you've got a protein is", "31:39", "called a Triskelion and they joined", "31:42", "themselves along the edges of the", "31:44", "pattern of the soccer ball okay but it's", "31:45", "just the it's just a substance made of", "31:51", "these proteins and what are they doing", "31:53", "hanging around in the synapses I know", "31:56", "but the symmetry has a key role as a", "31:59", "thing called the yarn teller effect in", "32:01", "quantum mechanics which tells you that", "32:03", "when you have a highly symmetrical", "32:06", "structure like that then there can be a", "32:08", "big gap between the lowest energy level", "32:11", "and the next one and there can be", "32:12", "information in this lowest energy level", "32:14", "which can be shielded from the higher", "32:18", "energy levels so this is a sort of", "32:20", "suggestion that some kind of quantum", "32:22", "phenomenon is going on in a serious way", "32:25", "and there's a lot to understand there I", "32:28", "mean synapses themselves the kind of", "32:30", "strange things you might think if you", "32:32", "were going to build a brain why don't", "32:33", "you just solder the wires together at", "32:35", "the connections you see what are you", "32:36", "doing having this thing with all the", "32:38", "chemist chemicals transferring this", "32:40", "information you know I don't know but", "32:43", "it's something very needed for my the", "32:45", "system and it's all tied up with these", "32:47", "Clarins there and", "32:49", "and decide to skeleton structures which", "32:52", "microtubules are one of the main", "32:54", "constituents so you see I don't know", "32:57", "that there's a lot to learn I'm sure so", "32:59", "it seems like there's a bunch of", "33:01", "different factors there's the biological", "33:02", "understanding of the brain itself yeah", "33:04", "and then there's the understanding of", "33:06", "the actual nature of cells and of", "33:10", "reality itself this is being more", "33:13", "illuminated by science with every new", "33:16", "discovery and we're getting a better", "33:17", "understanding deeper and deeper as to", "33:19", "their very nature of matter and of these", "33:23", "structures themselves I think it is", "33:24", "getting deep into the end of the way the", "33:27", "physical world operates and things that", "33:29", "we don't understand about it just yet", "33:31", "yes I mean the biology is one side of it", "33:34", "you know coming as an outsider I get", "33:36", "struck by certain things I mean quite", "33:39", "familiar with the fact that the right", "33:40", "side of the cerebrum controls the left", "33:43", "hand and the left hand the right hand", "33:45", "but then you look at this and it's not", "33:47", "just that what about the soles of your", "33:49", "feet right at the top what about your", "33:52", "eyes the the signals right at the back", "33:54", "hmm you think this is the most", "33:56", "ridiculous construction you've gone to", "33:58", "the worst possible place yes there must", "34:00", "be a reason and the cerebellum is", "34:02", "different go cerebellum it's the left", "34:05", "side controls the left side and the", "34:06", "right side the right side so there's", "34:08", "something going on which involves these", "34:11", "signals going having to cross each other", "34:13", "or whatever it is I don't know well we'd", "34:15", "like to think that there's a reason but", "34:16", "then we look at other biological", "34:18", "life-forms and they look kind of", "34:19", "preposterous like a platypus for", "34:21", "instance what is that is that an", "34:24", "experiment is that a prototype that just", "34:26", "ran wild well I guess you got to think", "34:30", "of it in terms of natural selection so", "34:33", "yeah I guess the circumstances there I", "34:35", "don't know yeah in Australia wherever", "34:37", "you find it must be specific we got I", "34:41", "guess the a lot of that was because they", "34:43", "were isolated from from the rest of the", "34:47", "so you get sort of strange animals in", "34:49", "Australia and in New Zealand where", "34:52", "a lot of isolation from from the rest of", "34:55", "the evolution so they did their own", "34:56", "thing there", "34:57", "yeah marsupials yes yeah just intriguing", "35:00", "what this the the phrase quantum is", "35:04", "another one that's fraught with whoo", "35:07", "indeed right and some people like Deepak", "35:11", "Chopra and the like they love to use", "35:14", "that word because as soon as you use", "35:15", "that word you can kind of get away with", "35:17", "almost anything after it's just yes I", "35:20", "have to say I have quantum mechanics is", "35:23", "a strange thing and I saw the blame it", "35:27", "for certain things I don't want to be", "35:29", "unfair I'm not saying yes I blame it it", "35:31", "gives some people of the impression okay", "35:33", "the fact your theory doesn't make any", "35:35", "sense that's nothing against it you've", "35:36", "said crazy things quite a McCants is", "35:39", "crazy so why don't you accept some other", "35:41", "crazy theory of course quantum mechanics", "35:43", "has the virtue that it does agree with", "35:45", "an awful lot of experiments he gives you", "35:47", "a huge insight sense of things that one", "35:49", "didn't have before so just the fact that", "35:52", "it's crazy isn't enough to to make to", "35:55", "make it something you should study", "35:56", "seriously well well it's very very", "36:01", "difficult to understand even for people", "36:03", "who study it yes indeed so for someone", "36:05", "like myself I'm trying to pay attention", "36:08", "to this without devoting my entire life", "36:10", "to it yeah and it gets it becomes a big", "36:13", "problem because there's two III in one", "36:17", "of my books I tried to explain there are", "36:19", "actually two mysteries in quantum", "36:21", "mechanics and they get muddled one of", "36:24", "them is the whole subject is pretty", "36:26", "crazy", "36:27", "yes but it's coherent and it makes sense", "36:31", "and if you study it properly and you say", "36:33", "okay but that makes sense and this", "36:35", "includes things like non-local effects", "36:38", "where you can have two things", "36:39", "now even thousands of kilometers apart", "36:42", "and you can see these quantum", "36:44", "entanglement effects yes they still in", "36:47", "some sense connected with each other", "36:48", "even though they're that far apart which", "36:50", "is pretty amazing that's baffling that's", "36:52", "baffling but that's part of the",

living", "47:58", "there at the time I don't remember but", "48:00", "he observed what became what we call the", "48:03", "the first quasar so this was an object", "48:07", "which was", "48:08",

looked then is that these quasar", "49:30", "ass could be having some black hole in", "49:34", "the middle of them and I remember John", "49:36", "Wheeler who was at Princeton then very", "49:39",

symmetrical", "50:05", "light like thee Oppenheimer schneider", "50:07", "model you assume it's got very special", "50:09", "properties and then you can maybe solve", "50:11", "the equations but only

into details here but", "63:38", "it means that that if you have things", "63:42", "without mass the most particularly the", "63:44", "photons then that boundary is just like", "63:48", "anywhere else and the photons go zipping", "63:50", "up to it and so you might think they", "63:52", "gotta have somewhere to go okay well", "63:54", "that's a you don't have to think that", "63:56", "but that was the point of view I had the", "63:59", "photons need to need somewhere to enter", "64:01", "in a way but then where does it go but", "64:04", "then there's the other picture which is", "64:05", "the opposite then there's the Big Bang", "64:07", "now you can do a similar sort of trick", "64:10", "there which is stretching it out and", "64:13", "making it into a boundary and that can", "64:16", "be

nevertheless it's what", "65:14", "starts our universe off in in a very", "65:18", "special state which is what we live off", "65:21", "in a way it's the second law of", "65:22", "thermodynamics needs that to get going", "65:25", "anyway I don't know if you want to worry", "65:27", "about that but anyway the point was that", "65:29", "it looks as though it's a good condition", "65:32", "on the Big Bang but it also should be", "65:35", "conformally I like a boundary which if", "65:38", "you had no mass you wouldn't notice it", "65:41", "okay you've got particles with mass", "65:43", "running

after Einstein produces theory", "67:30", "and this Alexander Friedmann who was a", "67:33", "Russian mathematical physicist he", "67:35", "produced the first cousin cosmology", "67:37", "models and

of his models the only trouble", "67:48", "is if you put irregularities into these", "67:50", "models you get black holes and these", "67:52", "black holes can Palmer Crooker I mean", "67:53", "incredible mess at the end and that", "67:55", "doesn't join onto a nice smooth Big Bang", "67:57", "the next one so you have trouble with", "67:59", "those months but still people take these",

that they don't take into", "68:11", "account the the black hole problem which", "68:15", "is that my 1 gets rid of that because", "68:18", "the black holes all evaporate away by", "68:20", "Hawking

the whole cluster", "69:23", "and what happens to the energy in those", "69:26", "black holes well it goes out in Hawking", "69:28", "radiation it takes an age ages and ages", "69:32", "and ages maybe 10 to 100 year Google", "69:36", "years or something ages and ages but all", "69:40", "that energy in the picture comes out", "69:43", "basically in one point think of that", "69:44", "Asha picture and right at the very edge", "69:47", "you see there are novel lot of angels", "69:49", "and devils squashed together there so", "69:52", "that the entire radiation from that", "69:54", "single black

"that's what we call the Hawking point", "70:07", "and it spreads out you see what we see", "70:10", "in the Cosmic Microwave Background this", "70:13", "is radiation coming from all directions", "70:15", "and this radiation doesn't come from the", "70:18", "Big Bang exactly", "70:20", "it comes from 380,000 years after the", "70:23", "Big Bang so there's a sort of last", "70:24", "scattering

have the", "71:23", "techniques and the actual analyzing the", "71:27", "data this is the Planck satellite data", "71:29", "whose done by Daniel an and then we look", "71:33", "at the data and we seem to see an effect", "71:36", "which see what you do is you we've got", "71:38", "only one universe that's what to", "71:40", "complain about so how do you know if", "71:41", "something's real or not where you make", "71:43", "zillions of fake universes and you", "71:46", "compare this with them there's a lot of", "71:47", "technique about how you do this but", "71:50", "Daniel first did a thousand of these", "71:52", "fakes and they were sort of two sizes of", "71:56", "these you look at these rings to see", "71:58", "whether the temperature goes out from", "71:59", "the outside to the middle and there were", "72:02", "two sizes both within this size that I'd", "72:05", "say about four degrees across the sky", "72:08", "and there was no evidence of them at all", "72:12", "in the simulation so this is a real", "72:14", "effect", "72:15", "okay then people were skeptical of this", "72:17", "for one reason or another so Daniel did", "72:20", "another well 10,000 altogether and you", "72:24", "occasionally there one or two which do", "72:26", "what two or three to be precise where", "72:28", "you see this effect in", "72:29", "simulations but if you work out the", "72:31", "probability that this is a real effect", "72:34", "you come up with a confidence level of", "72:37", "99.98% that this is a real effect so", "72:41", "we're waiting to see what people say", "72:42", "about this what are you thoughts on", "72:45", "multiverses well you see this is", "72:49", "different because this is what", "72:50", "sequential yeah so I don't call it a", "72:53", "multiverse they each influence the next", "72:55", "one and so they're not independent", "72:57", "worlds right but in the possibility of", "73:00", "independent yeah well you see there are", "73:04", "two reasons for believing multiverses", "73:06", "one of them is the quantum reason that", "73:09", "maybe will you have the Schrodinger's", "73:12", "dead cat in the live cat they're in", "73:13", "different worlds and they separate", "73:15", "universes I don't believe that argument", "73:18", "I don't think that's the right way to", "73:19", "look at quantum mechanics but many", "73:20", "people do and that suggests that you", "73:23", "might have these multiple universes and", "73:25", "some what's unattractive about that to", "73:26", "you it doesn't explain what we see so", "73:29", "you want a theory which explains the", "73:31", "world we see mm-hmm and the world we see", "73:33", "you get collapse the the state does and", "73:37", "to explain that well it's only because", "73:39", "we've drifted off into some world and", "73:41", "another version of ourselves is drifting", "73:43", "to another one and some see one and the", "73:45", "other city over and they're all in", "73:47", "superposition it doesn't explain why you", "73:51", "see one world in this kind of coherence", "73:56", "I mean lots of people try and there are", "73:59", "many attempts at this sort of thing it's", "74:00", "quite a widely held view and if you", "74:03", "believe quantum mechanics that the", "74:05", "collapse is not real and it doesn't", "74:07", "happen and all the alternatives the dead", "74:10", "cats and a live cat coexists in", "74:12", "different worlds that's the", "74:13", "interpretation that's a view I don't", "74:16", "think that I want I want an explanation", "74:18", "for the world we live in and you don't", "74:21", "see cast different worlds with cats and", "74:24", "well it's a long story", "74:26", "right I mean it's clearly it's a view", "74:28", "you can home to and if you don't want to", "74:30", "monkey with quantum mechanics it's where", "74:32", "you let so that's that's right that's", "74:35", "the alternative either you don't make a", "74:37", "single trying to change quantum", "74:39", "mechanics at all and then you are led to", "74:42", "this multi-world many many world picture", "74:46", "yeah I think it even doesn't make that", "74:49", "much sense so you gotta be careful about", "74:50", "it and that whether they are really like", "74:53", "different distinct worlds I don't think", "74:55", "it really my

a few years so the things which are", "89:29", "really you can get your hold on you can", "89:32", "get and test them and see whether", "89:33", "they're right or not so this would be a", "89:36",

yes", "90:22", "that's absolutely right and of course", "90:24", "you've got to play with ideas which are", "90:26", "on the sort of edge of what we know", "90:28", "otherwise you're stuck with what

right", "92:05", "I put it abandon this idea all these", "92:07", "things come from criticisms and to have", "92:11", "absolutely no tension whatsoever paid to", "92:14", "these papers something I find spooky why", "92:18", "do you think there's no attention paid I", "92:20", "don't know I don't really know I mean", "92:25", "one of the things is there's so much", "92:26", "information and that people don't have", "92:30", "time they've got run projects and they", "92:32", "don't want to pay attention and they", "92:34", "think it looks crazy because it's too", "92:38", "much outside the

look crazy and other people", "93:15", "don't look any it as crazy as my ideas", "93:17", "you see so maybe this why a lot of them", "93:21", "have more attention page than the ones", "93:22", "we actually I'm curious to know whether", "93:25", "the Hawking points will take off or not", "93:27", "well I'm so happy there's people like", "93:29", "you doing this kind of work and then", "93:31",
