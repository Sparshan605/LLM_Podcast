right now right I", "02:39", "can basically sell that future sale", "02:41", "because I think that sales going to be a", "02:43", "good one now right I can say what if I", "02:46", "did that trade I'm

worth", "03:36", "you know on February 3rd why is that", "03:40", "legal well it's legal because what it", "03:42", "because the economy requires it right we", "03:45", "have a kind of money right that has a", "03:47", "clock in it it's lent into existence and", "03:50", "has to be paid back more than got lent", "03:53", "out so our economy needs to expand by", "03:55", "hook or by crook

future that we can bet on that", "04:16", "or we can bet on that", "04:17", "right but what we're really doing is", "04:19", "trying to kind of compress all of this", "04:21", "time right onto like the head of a pin", "04:23", "so we can bet on that so", "04:25", "have to sit in wait you know 3,000 years", "04:27", "for Facebook to be worth something", "04:29", "I can't radars future worth now but the", "04:32", "whole joke of that is people who are", "04:34", "trading that way they're these computers", "04:36", "that are trading faster than them so I", "04:37", "put in one of my superfast crazy you", "04:40", "know derivative trade goldman sachs", "04:42", "sees that order coming in on the", "04:45", "computer they're so close to the", "04:47", "exchange they can execute an order",

past no", "04:59", "that's that's digital time shift that's", "05:01", "that sounds like is cheating that's like", "05:04", "someone like running a quick server and", "05:06", "they're local and then you have like 150", "05:08", "ping exactly that's bullshit I think so", "05:13", "with the sort of bullshit the irony of", "05:14", "it is it's gotten so big right", "05:16", "derivative trading is bigger than", "05:18", "regular trading yeah so that the New", "05:20", "York Stock Exchange actually just got", "05:22", "bought the exchange itself got bought by", "05:25", "its derivative exchange so it's almost", "05:28", "just like the proofs in the pudding it's", "05:30", "like the derivative owns the market at", "05:32", "this point but that's how that how could", "05:37", "the government

how few not fix this", "05:57", "why would you ever try to do anything", "06:00", "else before you fix this when they made", "06:03", "the decision they genuinely thought it", "06:05", "would be good for business I will never", "06:10", "understand you at all close this", "06:12", "business people promised them they", "06:13", "figured out before it got really bad oh", "06:16", "my god we figured it out before it got", "06:18", "really bad how much bigger is the", "06:20", "derivative economy I don't know exactly", "06:23", "I mean it seemed I was looking trying to", "06:25", "find out what that what the sort of", "06:27", "trading was it seemed from what I could", "06:29", "tell like that 94% of trades are now", "06:33", "derivative because they're because", "06:35", "they're because there's such bigger", "06:37", "volumes oh my", "06:38", "god that's insane no one's gonna you're", "06:40", "not gonna buy you know 10,000 shares of", "06:42", "Honeywell today because that's you
