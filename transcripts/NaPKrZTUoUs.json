"name of it right no I didn't come up", "10:50", "with the name of the name", "10:52", "well let me go back to to the beginning", "10:54", "because actually the technology of", "10:55", "podcasting was invented in 2000 so", "10:57", "before anyone was podcasting before", "11:00", "there was", "11:00", "an iPod interestingly I was living in", "11:03", "Amsterdam at the time and I was working", "11:06", "with Dave Winer who had really invented", "11:09", "blogging and he had created this RSS", "11:12", "syndication format and he had software", "11:15", "you could blog and then an aggregator", "11:16", "kind of like you know Google Reader at", "11:18", "the time and you couldn't you know read", "11:20", "blogs it was kind of like a two-way", "11:22", "communication thing was interesting and", "11:24", "a lot of people are starting to use it", "11:25", "and in Amsterdam they had cable modems", "11:28", "rolled out everywhere and cable modems", "11:31", "were sold at the time as always", "11:32", "on Internet it wasn't fast it was just", "11:35", "fucking on you didn't have to dial in", "11:37", "which was oh my god this is great you", "11:38", "know this was a huge improvement didn't", "11:40", "have to kick someone off the phone line", "11:42", "all that so the the the the experience", "11:49", "of multimedia was shit like you wanted", "11:53", "to hear a song or play a video it was", "11:55", "like click wait wait wait download wait", "11:59", "you know it would probably download and", "12:00", "then open up some kind of player and", "12:02", "then it was not an experience there was", "12:04", "nothing nothing there that made sense so", "12:06", "and I always wanted to broadcast on the", "12:08", "unit that's always been my thing from", "12:09", "the moment I saw it so I came up with", "12:13", "this concept of the last yard I said", "12:15", "what if you had a little thing running", "12:17", "on your computer in the background that", "12:19", "would know if there's something you", "12:21", "wanted let's just forget that how it", "12:23", "knows part it would download it and it", "12:26", "would tell you that there was something", "12:27", "new when it already had it on its local", "12:29", "hard drive so you remove the whole wait", "12:32", "experience because you don't know you", "12:33", "don't know that this computer has been", "12:35", "downloading something you've wanted it", "12:37", "just tells you oh it's here which is you", "12:39", "know it's not abnormal in media you're", "12:41", "the 6 o'clock news most of its produced", "12:43", "before the actual broadcast so I took", "12:46", "this idea to Dave and I said we need to", "12:49", "come up with something that can download", "12:51", "a media file that I program somehow like", "12:54", "this is going to show up and then it", "12:57", "downloads it and only tells me when it's", "12:59", "there and I can click on it it plays", "13:01", "immediately and it it took some", "13:03", "convincing he didn't exactly understand", "13:05", "what I was saying he probably thought I", "13:07", "have fucking MTV God in fact that's", "13:10", "exactly what he thought", "13:12", "and and then I actually demonstrated to", "13:15", "him what I wanted to do in his own", "13:17", "software and he said okay I'm gonna do", "13:21", "this but only on the condition you never", "13:23", "ever ever fucking use my software again", "13:26", "because that was horrible what you just", "13:27", "did and so we created the enclosure", "13:29", "element in RSS and so for two years we", "13:33", "were doing back and forth you know like", "13:35", "movie files and stuff and I'll click and", "13:37", "would open up and the experience was", "13:38", "good until I saw my first iPod friend of", "13:42", "mine said look at this I'm like oh this", "13:44", "is the white one with the big deal on it", "13:47", "that was a good one right they got high", "13:48", "after a while like hard drive and I", "13:51", "looked at and went this is not a digital", "13:55", "Walkman this is a fucking radio receiver", "13:57", "because I had one I had a Sony AM radio", "13:59", "trend receiver which is a little", "14:02", "solid-state thing like this is a radio", "14:04", "this can receive radio programming and", "14:07", "so I said about again with my fantastic", "14:10", "programming sales skills to make a", "14:13", "little application and you're the iPod", "14:16", "at the time you still had to sync it to", "14:17", "iTunes is how you got music onto it back", "14:20", "in the day and so you could put a mp3", "14:24", "file into a blog post basically but it", "14:27", "was a special attachment really and so", "14:30", "this program would just be looking all", "14:31", "the time is there something new is there", "14:33", "something new oh there's something new", "14:34", "download it then click trip it so that", "14:37", "it's synchronized to the iPod and it", "14:41", "works now not being a programmer that's", "14:44", "actually Kevin marks a guy was working", "14:46", "at Apple sent me a version of the script", "14:48", "that actually worked that was helpful", "14:49", "and I said about creating a radio show", "14:52", "which we didn't have the name podcast", "14:54", "yet and I wanted to be able to talk to", "14:59", "developers software developers who could", "15:01", "create receivers so we had iPod or iPod", "15:06", "or X iPod or lemon all the all these", "15:08", "different applications which kind of did", "15:10", "the same thing and because I was talking", "15:12", "to developers I called it the daily", "15:15", "source code so I did every day and", "15:16", "source code is kind of what the", "15:18", "developers work in and I was really", "15:20", "talking to them like okay well the guys", "15:22", "over in New Zealand they you know", "15:23", "they've created this version of", "15:25", "and it's really working well and we", "15:26", "discovered all kinds of crazy shit like", "15:28", "you subscribe to a feed because we know", "15:33", "one to thought it through we would try", "15:34", "and download you know everything you had", "15:36", "in that feed all at once so trying to", "15:37", "download 50 episodes and we still had", "15:40", "kind of always on internet so everything", "15:43", "would crunch and die and this just kept", "15:46", "building and building and other people", "15:47", "started doing these and we called them", "15:50", "soliloquies and little bundles of joy", "15:52", "and all kinds

them", "26:27", "to be annoying so what I liked so much", "26:29", "is that", "26:30", "comedians gravitated toward it and said", "26:33", "okay we can be funny and we can do stuff", "26:36", "that isn't necessarily our jokes that", "26:38", "are gonna get ripped off because that's", "26:39", "I think for the longest time comedians", "26:41", "would be like I don't want to be on the", "26:42", "internet not putting my shit out there", "26:44", "because people will steal my jokes yeah", "26:46", "and they'll steal my whole routine and", "26:47", "if anything you and comedians started to", "26:51", "really blanket the landscape and show", "26:53", "you know what could be done with this", "26:55", "and the fact that everyone could just", "26:57", "kind of you know receive it on their on", "27:00", "their phone was fantastic we kind of", "27:02", "created a real organic Network that's", "27:05", "one of the things that we all kind of", "27:06", "talked about it that networks if you", "27:08", "think of a network like NBC or whatever", "27:10", "you think of its it's a controlled", "27:13", "network with executives and shareholders", "27:15", "and then there's advertised",

"27:25", "Tuesday at 8:00 and these guys are on", "27:27", "Thursday at 7:00 and then all that so I", "27:29", "made that same mistake thinking that I", "27:31", "could build a podcast network and run it", "27:34", "kind of like like a hybrid network", "27:37", "record company mm-hmm", "27:39", "and raised a lot of money to do it too", "27:41", "first mistake is that the VC guys they", "27:43", "wanted us to be in San Francisco who", "27:45", "builds a media company in San Francisco", "27:47", "but okay it just doesn't work for a", "27:54", "number of reasons but the main one is", "27:56", "the advertising model is just not built", "27:59", "for this an advertiser wants to know and", "28:01", "I'm talking real advertise I'm not", "28:02", "talking you know underwear and", "28:04",

canceled", "28:22", "culture through social networking they", "28:26", "want no part of it so it's just not", "28:28", "going to be spectacular the way you know", "28:32", "something you're not gonna take those", "28:33", "advertisers away what I meant by a", "28:35", "network is not that no I know but that's", "28:38", "what I'm saying is like I tried to build", "28:39", "the contain Network failed in my mind", "28:42", "hey I mean people made money and", "28:44", "everything the investors didn't make", "28:46", "money but I tried to do that all things", "28:49", "they're still trying it it's just it's", "28:51", "not that profitable and it's also the", "28:53", "ones that are successful or successful", "28:55", "and the other ones aren't and like the", "28:57", "idea that they're all sharing revenue", "28:58", "it's like okay you kind of eat with you", "29:00", "kill so what you what you're trying to", "29:03", "say here about the ad hoc network he's", "29:05", "totally the way to go what I'm saying is", "29:07", "it's just that we didn't even think", "29:08", "about it we just were supporting each", "29:10", "other yeah comedians always suffered", "29:12", "from famine syndrome because there was", "29:15", "only a few shows on television and we", "29:17", "were all trying to be on a sitcom or you", "29:20", "were all trying to be the host of a", "29:21", "late-night

competition between comedians", "29:31", "then somewhere along the line the", "29:32", "internet came along and then YouTube", "29:34", "videos started making people famous and", "29:36", "then podcast started making people", "29:38", "famous and then we all realize like the", "29:41", "old model of like hey if you do Leno you", "29:43", "can't do Letterman like there was a lot", "29:45",
