began 13.8 billion years ago", "05:40", "but actually all we know really was the", "05:42", "universe was very hot and very dense at", "05:44", "that time and we have some theories that", "05:46",

I think at the", "07:01", "moment but what happened but why the Big", "07:03", "Bang is the way that it is who's got", "07:06", "some very special features the Big Bang", "07:07", "which we could talk about but inflation", "07:09", "is the idea that space space-time was", "07:12", "around before the Big Bang and it was", "07:14", "expanding extremely fast there was", "07:16", "doubling in size in

expansion and then the", "07:30", "idea is that draws to a close so quite", "07:32", "naturally so dies away in the expansion", "07:34", "slows down and all the energy that was", "07:37", "taken there

"aware of what you're saying I can I can", "08:20", "sort of visualize it in some sort of a", "08:22", "graphic form but it's incomprehensible", "08:24", "like my mind doesn't it doesn't have the", "08:27", "capacity to expand the this sense of", "08:31", "distance and size to that that grasp is", "08:34", "this because of just the way we evolved", "08:36", "we evolved here on earth to deal with", "08:39", "the space that's in front of us and now", "08:41", "over the course of you know in", "08:43", "industrial civilization and education", "08:45", "we're now grasping these concepts that", "08:48", "are so alien to the reality that", "08:52", "the tangible reality that we exist in", "08:54", "everyday I'm sure that's right and", "08:56", "they're the you know even very simple", "08:59", "things like you go back to the Greeks so", "09:01", "Aristotle and there's great you know", "09:03", "very clever people but they thought the", "09:05", "earth was a center of the universe no", "09:07", "why because it feels like it's at the", "09:09", "same time it feels like we're not moving", "09:11", "and that's quite a deep point actually", "09:14", "in physics it's like why is it that", "09:16", "we're flying around relative to the Sun", "09:18", "very fast at whatever speed is 80 miles", "09:21", "a second or something like that and the", "09:22", "whole solar system is going around the", "09:24", "Milky Way galaxy and so on why is it", "09:26", "that we don't feel it and then the", "09:29", "Greeks quite naturally said well because", "09:30", "we're at the center of the universe", "09:31", "they also said everything falls towards", "09:33", "the earth so therefore the earth", "09:35", "possibly at the center is its natural", "09:37", "right and actually it's quite a deep", "09:41", "thought so to understand why it didn't", "09:44", "feel that we're moving you you have to", "09:45", "go all the way to Einstein really for", "09:47", "someone to take that very seriously and", "09:50", "he said actually he said well this", "09:52", "there's a great little explanation in", "09:55", "Stephen Hawking's brief history of time", "09:57", "about this that the idea that you can't", "09:59", "tell whether you're moving or not", "10:00", "demolish is the notion of absolute space", "10:02", "so if we think about spective as its", "10:05", "face of you or most people I suppose", "10:07", "you'd think the way that Newton did have", "10:09", "a big box within which things happen and", "10:12", "that's gotta be that's a natural picture", "10:13", "of space and the universe isn't it a", "10:15", "thing in which all the planets and", "10:17", "galaxies are placed but in in the brief", "10:20", "history of time Hawking says well", "10:22", "imagine bouncing a ball so he bounced a", "10:24", "ball that stable now a tennis ball so I", "10:26", "drop it and I catch you again so let's", "10:29", "say I drop it it takes a second to", "10:30", "bounce up so in that second the earth", "10:33", "has moved about 80 miles or so in space", "10:36", "around the Sun so you could ask the", "10:38", "question did that ball return to the", "10:41", "same place in space or not and the", "10:43", "answer is you can't answer it it does", "10:47", "from our perspective but from the", "10:48", "perspective is someone watching the", "10:50", "earth go all the way around the Sun it", "10:52", "when I caught it again it had moved 80", "10:54", "miles and then from some other", "10:55", "perspective it would have done something", "10:57", "else so the point is you can't say this", "10:59", "is a point in space it came back to the", "11:02", "same place because", "11:03", "that just depends on your perspective", "11:06", "depends on whether you watching the Sun", "11:07", "the earth go around the Sun on whatever", "11:09", "it is so so Einstein said that means", "11:11", "there's no such thing as absolute space", "11:14", "which kind of follows if you think about", "11:16", "it but that's a difficult it's it's a", "11:19", "cool but difficult thought process right", "11:22", "I mean that's that's essentially what's", "11:23", "happening when you're on a plane I mean", "11:25", "if you're throwing a ball up in the air", "11:26", "and catching it on the plane it's", "11:27", "happening in a much smaller scale right", "11:29", "yeah yeah I mean you're flying it", "11:30", "whatever six hundred miles an hour", "11:32", "relative to the ground but when you're", "11:34", "sitting there yeah and Einstein elevated", "11:36", "that to a principle and said if you're", "11:38", "moving it a beauty you're not", "11:40", "accelerating you're just moving at a", "11:41", "constant speed in a plane or now I mean", "11:44", "that's essentially what we're doing now", "11:46", "we're moving around the Sun it", "11:47", "effectively constant speed then you", "11:50", "can't tell so there's no experiment you", "11:52", "can do we could look at the decay of a", "11:54", "radioactive nucleus or some electricity", "11:57", "and magnetism or bounce a ball have a", "11:59", "pendulum whatever it is and there's no", "12:01", "experiment you can do to tell you", "12:02", "whether you're moving or not therefore", "12:04", "that concept has no meaning because you", "12:08", "can't measure it and that that's led", "12:12", "Einstein to relativity so that that's", "12:14", "the basis of general relativity which is", "12:17", "our best theory of the universe now why", "12:19", "is it that we think that the known", "12:23", "universe is larger than we can observe", "12:26", "well one point is that it's an expanding", "12:31", "and and we always see the same radiation", "12:34", "out there so the glow of the Big Bang", "12:37", "but there's some deeper reasons and the", "12:40", "one from the theory of inflation there", "12:46", "the the best way to explain the universe", "12:50", "the properties that we see is that it's", "12:53", "very much bigger than the piece we can", "12:55", "see so for example we measure space to", "12:58", "be what's called flat I don't mean I'd", "13:00", "say what's called flat it is flat so if", "13:02", "you imagine slices of space let's", "13:05", "imagine slices of them at different", "13:06", "times so you just slice the universe and", "13:10", "say there's a big sheets like this today", "13:11", "I could tear a sheet of space and", "13:13", "there's another sheet another sheet and", "13:14", "it can it can have a geometry right", "13:17", "flat like a tabletop or it could be", "13:19", "curved like a sphere or it could be", "13:21", "curved in the opposite direction sort of", "13:23", "like a saddle or a bowl and we can", "13:26", "measure that and when we measure it we", "13:27", "see its absolutely flat and that's a", "13:30", "very unusual thing for it to be like it", "13:35", "requires because what Einstein's theory", "13:37", "says is that the shape of space that the", "13:40", "curvature of space is determined by the", "13:42", "stuff that's in it that's that's", "13:44", "basically Einstein's theory of general", "13:45", "relativity put stuff in space and it", "13:47", "curbs it and bends it and warps it and", "13:49", "stretches it and so on and what we find", "13:52", "is that with there's precisely the right", "13:54", "amount of stuff in the universe to have", "13:56", "a completely flat universe and the the", "14:00", "explanation the most favored explanation", "14:02", "for that is the universe is way bigger", "14:03", "than the piece we can see and so it's", "14:05", "like looking at a piece of the earth oh", "14:06", "you look a little one mile square of the", "14:10", "earth right then it's flat I mean you", "14:13", "have to look at big distances it's kind", "14:15", "of a vorded the radius of the earth or", "14:17", "not you know bigger bigger than 1", "14:19", "kilometer anyway on 1 mile to see that", "14:21", "actually you're on a curved surface and", "14:23", "that's one of the ideas about the the", "14:26", "universe and white appears to be the way", "14:28", "that it is because it's way way bigger", "14:30", "so we just we're just looking at a", "14:31", "little piece and that's why it looks", "14:33", "flat and that's one of the ideas", "14:37", "now when you say flat like that my brain", "14:41", "doesn't understand this because from our", "14:43", "perspective when you look up at the", "14:44", "Milky Way you see all these stars all", "14:47", "over the place so if you're saying flat", "14:49", "like it wow much height and what what", "14:52", "are you saying", "14:53", "so terms of like the way to measure it", "14:55", "the best way to think about it is not to", "14:57", "think of three dimensions of space", "14:58", "because then we can't picture it", "15:00", "ok but you can think of two like this", "15:02", "tabletop and that's all right we just", "15:04", "forget the other one for now and so you", "15:06", "know what flat is on this table I mean", "15:08", "you could define it so you could say for", "15:10", "example that if I draw a triangle on the", "15:12", "top of the table then all the angles add", "15:14", "up to 180 degrees so that actually", "15:17", "defines flat if you did that on the", "15:19", "surface of the earth with a big triangle", "15:21", "then the angles wouldn't add up 280", "15:23", "degrees or you could draw a circle and", "15:26", "say what's pi so pi is the ratio of the", "15:29", "circle", "15:30", "inference of a circle to its diameter", "15:31", "that's only true on a flat surface it's", "15:35", "different if the surface is curved so", "15:37", "you can define flatness so when you but", "15:40", "even when you're saying flatness how", "15:41", "what is the height and what is the width", "15:43", "like if you're talking about it as if", "15:46", "it's a table there must be some sort of", "15:47", "a there's a dimension to it correct oh", "15:49", "yeah there's a third dimension of space", "15:51", "but the same applies it's just a", "15:54", "generalization of geometry then say you", "15:57", "can pick there fires we can picture it", "15:59", "in two dimensions but you can you can", "16:01", "draw you can quite literally you could", "16:04", "imagine sending like beams out then we", "16:06", "do this measurement actually we can look", "16:08", "at the the disk the most distant light", "16:10", "we can see which is something called the", "16:13", "cosmic microwave background radiation", "16:15", "which is if you if you imagine looking", "16:17", "out if you look at the Andromeda galaxy", "16:20", "which we can see with the naked eye here", "16:22", "in LA you can see that it's the most", "16:24", "distant object you can see with the", "16:25", "naked eye and it's about 2 2 million", "16:28", "light years away also which means the", "16:30", "light took 2 million years to get to us", "16:32", "so it's a long way away but it's very", "16:34", "big so as you look further out into the", "16:38", "universe 2 more and more distant", "16:39", "galaxies you're looking further back in", "16:41", "time because you look at something", "16:42", "that's a billion light years away then", "16:44", "the light took a billion years to get to", "16:46", "us so you see as it was a billion years", "16:47", "in the past and we can actually look so", "16:50", "far out that we can see almost back to", "16:54", "13.8 billion years ago which is very", "16:57", "close to the Big Bang so we can look to", "17:00", "light that began its journey before", "17:01", "there were galaxies and that's the", "17:03", "oldest light in the universe which is by", "17:05", "the way one of the one of the pieces of", "17:08",

what", "22:47", "happens right in the middle but they", "22:49", "collapsed a search and extent that", "22:51", "there's a region around it where from", "22:54", "which light can't escape and that's a so", "22:57", "nothing can escape and that that's a", "22:59", "black hole and what happens to them do", "23:02", "they travel are they moving through", "23:05", "space yeah they're still stars right you", "23:08", "know so they they're still there they're", "23:11", "surrounded this region where have you", "23:13", "fallen it's called the event horizon", "23:16", "and if you go across that horizon then", "23:18", "you are going to the center there's one", "23:20", "way of thinking about it which is quite", "23:22", "cool which is that the time and space", "23:24", "sort of flip is one

"that's that's your future every every", "23:45", "line of your future points to the center", "23:48", "of the black hole so it's kind of the", "23:50", "ultimate I've no escape for the ultimate", "23:53", "prison you're gonna get squashed to an", "23:55", "infinitely dense so anoint not every", "23:58", "star becomes a black hole at the end of", "24:00", "its life no because if something like", "24:03", "the Sun and we have a small star it's", "24:06", "quite small yeah and when it collapses", "24:08", "there's a there's a sort of pressure a", "24:13", "force if you like which is caused by the", "24:16", "fact that electrons don't like to be", "24:18", "very close to each other so it's called", "24:20", "the Pauli exclusion principle", "24:22", "but essentially what happens is that so", "24:25", "as they get squashed closer and closer", "24:27", "together they move faster and faster to", "24:29", "get out of each other's way if you like", "24:31", "and that makes a force which holds them", "24:33", "up and so that creates what's called a", "24:36", "white dwarf star so you can have a blob", "24:39", "of matte so they're about the size of", "24:40", "the earth but they're about the mass of", "24:42", "the Sun and so that's that's for smaller", "24:45", "stars they end up as these white dwarf", "24:47", "things which are very dense objects", "24:49", "there's another version which is called", "24:51", "the neutron star which is the same thing", "24:54", "but for neutrons and they they move", "24:56", "faster and faster so if it's if it's", "24:58", "massive enough that it overwhelms the", "25:01", "electron thing then the electrons sort", "25:03", "crush into protons and turn into", "25:05", "neutrons and the whole thing starts", "25:07", "again and so a neutron star can be you", "25:10", "know elite one-and-a-half times the mass", "25:12", "of the Sun let's say but it can be about", "25:15", "what 10 miles across so so that's an", "25:18", "incredibly dense ball of matter held up", "25:21", "by this the neutrons moving around it's", "25:24", "got a fancy name it's called Neutron", "25:25", "degeneracy pressure but I someone did it", "25:27", "but if you go even bigger then even that", "25:30", "can't hold it up and as far as we know", "25:32", "then there's no known force that we know", "25:34", "of that can hold hold the thing up if", "25:36", "it's too massive and so that's when it", "25:39", "just we almost winks out of existence if", "25:41", "you like oh it collapses and collapses", "25:43", "and collapses and and that's when you", "25:45", "get a black hole we try to put that into", "25:46", "perspective the earth the Sun is a", "25:48", "million times bigger than the earth yeah", "25:50", "and this this neutron star is would you", "25:54", "say one and a half times the mass of", "25:56", "this yes it has miles wide yeah yeah so", "25:59", "and it allowed to those around that they", "26:01", "called pulsars so we see those all over", "26:04", "the place though the first one that was", "26:05", "discovered was called lgm1", "26:07", "because there's spin very fast and then", "26:10", "it was called lgm1", "26:12", "because it's a very regular pulse and", "26:13", "they thought it was little green men so", "26:15", "they called it kind of jokingly little", "26:17", "green men one and then so yeah we've", "26:21", "seen that there's one called the crab", "26:22", "pulsar which is in the Crab Nebula which", "26:25", "we saw the supernova explosion so that's", "26:27", "when one of these stars explodes at the", "26:29", "end of its life and then collapses to", "26:31", "form a neutron star and we saw that in", "26:33", "1054 ad", "26:36", "wasn't there some speculation that our", "26:39", "gal or our solar system at one point was", "26:42", "was a binary star system and that one of", "26:46", "those stars had become a dwarf I don't", "26:50", "know and some someone had read something", "26:53", "about that in relationship to the dense", "26:56", "object they believe is outside the", "26:57", "Kuiper belt yeah I mean there's some", "26:59", "evidence there's a bit of evidence that", "27:01", "there's something out there yeah yeah", "27:02", "good because of the periodic extinctions", "27:06", "and things on earth you get periodic", "27:08", "bombardments from out in the Kuiper belt", "27:09", "so yeah I think one of the theories is", "27:11", "realloc extinctions well yeah so feel", "27:13", "like the you know that they've been", "27:15", "there have been mass extinctions on", "27:17", "earth where a lot of the life died and", "27:20", "then we don't know what caused all those", "27:23", "but sometimes their impacts from space", "27:25", "that seems clear and so yeah there are", "27:28", "theories that there's something orbiting", "27:30", "out there which can disrupt all these", "27:32", "objects out in the Kuiper belt that", "27:34", "sends loads of comets and asteroids", "27:36", "inwards to the inner solar system can", "27:39", "cause havoc so there's some people look", "27:43", "at those theories I mean I don't know", "27:46", "it's one of those it is a possibility", "27:49", "the speculation was that there's", "27:52", "something out there's correct me if I'm", "27:54", "wrong something called the Galactic", "27:55", "Shelf like that it gets to a certain", "27:57", "space in it indicates that there's", "27:59", "something far larger out there yeah I", "28:02", "mean I think I don't know the exact", "28:05", "about the stellar-sized no massive", "28:08", "objects out there I don't know that I", "28:09", "mean there's some sort of suggestions", "28:12", "there's another planet out there a big", "28:14", "planet for example but you're right that", "28:16", "can be that can be stuff always in way", "28:18", "beyond the Kuiper belt and we're talking", "28:20", "you know a light year away or something", "28:22", "like that now it's it's interesting", "28:24", "because it's incomprehensible the", "28:26", "distance right and in our minds how far", "28:28", "that must be out past what we used to", "28:30", "call Pluto but for whatever reason that", "28:33", "becomes more interesting because it's in", "28:35", "our neighborhood whereas if they find", "28:38", "some distant star system and it might", "28:42", "have a planet that's similar to earth", "28:43", "that doesn't seem as compelling for", "28:46", "whatever weird reason no yeah I mean I", "28:49", "think the", "28:49", "the planets around Alpha Centauri", "28:52", "Proxima Centauri which are the closest", "28:54", "stars", "28:55", "it seemed like there are planets around", "28:56", "those now and then that that was", "28:58", "interesting because we could conceive of", "29:00", "going there right and there was this", "29:02", "idea you're Stephen Hawking actually and", "29:04", "some others before he died had this idea", "29:06", "called breakthrough starshot which is", "29:08", "the idea to send a little probe out so", "29:11", "at the sense at the Alpha Centauri", "29:12", "system and I think in their view yuri", "29:16", "milner as well the you know the", "29:19", "entrepreneur wanted to do that and there", "29:21", "is i think it's in like a hundred years", "29:23", "travel time or something with with with", "29:25", "our current technology and they pointed", "29:27", "out that yeah we don't do that now we", "29:30", "don't think hundred years in the future", "29:31", "but did we go back when people are", "29:33", "building cathedrals people used to", "29:35", "routinely start projects that would take", "29:38", "a hundred years to bear fruit yeah so we", "29:40", "could imagine going there and that's", "29:42", "that then becomes fascinating I think", "29:44", "because then you've got a solar system", "29:46", "another solar system that you could go", "29:48", "and visit conceivably conceivably yeah I", "29:53", "mean what kind of speed are we talking", "29:55", "and how long would it take to get there", "29:57", "well yeah I mean so it is I think that", "29:59", "the idea was about a hundred years to", "30:01", "get there so it's going yeah four light", "30:04", "years or so in a hundred years to", "30:07", "essentially do what they didn't like to", "30:09", "Ridley Scott alien film and put people", "30:10", "into some sort of a oh yeah it wouldn't", "30:14", "be a cruelty probe wouldn't be possible", "30:16", "for a crew well it is reason yeah that's", "30:20", "always that you know whenever you talk", "30:21", "to engineers you had a London use yes", "30:23", "engineer's always say you know", "30:25", "physicists go well it's possible in", "30:26", "principle so over to you you know there", "30:30", "are no laws of physics that tell us we", "30:31", "can't do it so we just do it right but", "30:33", "you know yeah but but yeah in principle", "30:40", "you're right if you can send a little", "30:41", "robot spaceship there you can send a", "30:43", "crude spaceship I am of the opinion as", "30:47", "time goes on and augmented and virtual", "30:49", "reality gets better and better that it", "30:52", "doesn't really totally make sense unless", "30:55", "we're talking about colonizing some", "30:56", "place to send biological life to another", "30:59", "planet if we can send some probe that", "31:01", "doesn't have to worry about", "31:03", "you know the biology being affected by", "31:05", "radiation or by the speed of travel or", "31:08", "even by food we can send something out", "31:10", "there and almost be there by virtue of", "31:15", "you know goggles virtual reality goggles", "31:17", "or something else yeah you hear that in", "31:21", "science at the moment space science we", "31:24", "have this debate a lot actually because", "31:25", "of course space probes like curiosity", "31:28", "that's on Mars at the moment that's", "31:30", "really cheap compared to sending people", "31:32", "to Mars and so quite often the", "31:35", "scientists who want to find out about", "31:37", "the worlds will say well we should spend", "31:38", "it on robots we shouldn't spend it on", "31:40", "people I think Croods face exploration", "31:43", "is in in some ways and it's clearly true", "31:46", "at the moment that humans can do more", "31:48", "than robots so we can explore the place", "31:51", "better for now yeah but but I think it", "31:54", "has to be it's about something else I", "31:56", "mean it's about and it's not only it's", "32:00", "about living and working off the planet", "32:04", "which I think it's quite persuasive", "32:06", "argument actually we've already", "32:08", "industrialized near Earth orbit so it's", "32:10", "already a multi-billion dollar industry", "32:12", "in every communication satellites and", "32:14", "weather satellites GPS whatever yeah", "32:16", "we're already up there and so learning", "32:18", "to live and work in space is I think a", "32:21", "natural extension of our of our", "32:23", "civilization plus the fact if you talk", "32:25", "to Ilana or Jeff Bezos they point out", "32:28", "that the amount of resources available", "32:30", "just slightly above our heads is vast", "32:33", "and so I remember I talked to Jeff Bezos", "32:35", "actually once and he he thinks really", "32:37", "simply and he said no for example in the", "32:40", "asteroid belt there's enough metal I", "32:42", "think to build a skyscraper what is it", "32:46", "something like 800 stories tall and", "32:48", "cover the earth in it right if you want", "32:51", "now we don't want to do that where's", "32:53", "point was that that the energy from the", "32:55", "Sun is all up there the resources are up", "32:57", "there so you could almost imagine trying", "33:00", "to zone the earth residential at some", "33:02", "point in the future to protect the", "33:04", "planets and do your heavy industry off", "33:06", "the planet for example and these sound", "33:08", "this sounds like science fiction except", "33:11", "that now SpaceX and Blue Origin those", "33:13", "people have got reusable rockets so", "33:16", "suddenly the economic", "33:17", "become sensible so I think it i think i", "33:20", "think expansion is good and I think we", "33:23", "will expand and I think we will expand", "33:25", "outwards because there's not much room", "33:27", "left on this planet to expand so I think", "33:29", "we'll do so but it's that's a whole", "33:31", "different idea it's not about gathering", "33:33", "scientific information it's about a", "33:35", "frontier and all the benefits that come", "33:38", "from operating as a civilization on the", "33:41", "frontier which we've lost on the earth", "33:44", "because there is no front to your left", "33:45", "and so I like that idea", "33:47", "mmm that Mars and when you talk about", "33:49", "Mars especially with Elon he's right", "33:52", "that that's the only place you can go so", "33:54", "the reason our the planet we can go to", "33:56", "other than Mars you can't go to Jupiter", "33:58", "or Saturn goes of mercury or Venus so if", "34:01", "we want to go somewhere and expand our", "34:03", "civilization it has to be Mars and", "34:05", "everything is there that you need so", "34:07", "with that that's a different thing", "34:08", "saying you want to find out stuff you're", "34:10", "right if we just want to find out stuff", "34:11", "then you send robots but as far as", "34:14", "expanding actual civilization and", "34:16", "bringing it to another place one of the", "34:18", "things that freaks me out is people get", "34:20", "depressed about living in Seattle I mean", "34:22", "you're gonna live on Mars I wouldn't I", "34:25", "really yeah it's if he had horrendous", "34:28", "thing it's like the like the Western", "34:31", "Front yes difference here when people", "34:32", "cross the States", "34:33", "yeah incredibly dangerous thing to do", "34:35", "across the states they still got to", "34:38", "Wyoming in beautiful places and Colorado", "34:41", "and yeah but it was hard yeah I wouldn't", "34:43", "wanted to do it but once you got there", "34:45", "there's a river and there's trout in the", "34:47", "river and then the meadows are green and", "34:48", "it's it's right I mean I I agree with", "34:51", "you right I mean I'm not gonna go that", "34:53", "of the ravine yards and hotels but", "34:55", "however it is true that there are people", "34:59", "who like the challenge and what is true", "35:01", "about Mars it's interesting actually", "35:03", "because we know something about the", "35:05", "history of Mars now quite a lot about", "35:06", "history of Mars and it's certainly clear", "35:09", "that there was water almost certainly", "35:12", "oceans and rivers so and that water is", "35:15", "almost certainly still there so I would", "35:18", "say certainly still there well they have", "35:20", "found large quantities of ice now right", "35:22", "yeah so there's certainly ice there may", "35:24", "even be pockets of liquid water below", "35:26", "the surface somewhere so a couple that", "35:29", "with all the the mineral", "35:30", "and the resources that we know are there", "35:32", "and you have everything you need so", "35:34", "that's the thing about masses it's quite", "35:36", "nice relative to everywhere else other", "35:39", "than the earth you can't go to Venus you", "35:42", "know you just melt it what is it", "35:44", "four hundred and something degrees and", "35:46", "ninety atmospheric pressures yes so so", "35:50", "so Mars is quite nice but I wouldn't go", "35:53", "there I agree with you because it was", "35:55", "not gravity of Mars in relationship to", "35:56", "it so yeah so it would still have a", "36:01", "significant like weakening effect like", "36:03", "if you went to Mars and then somehow or", "36:06", "another in the future they they were", "36:07", "able to get back to earth", "36:08", "yeah your body would have a real problem", "36:11", "with that right would but there there is", "36:12", "there is still grab my spent more than a", "36:14", "third I can't quite remember but it's", "36:15", "something like that but yeah so you", "36:17", "there's still gravity so there's gravity", "36:20", "there's some protection from the you'd", "36:23", "probably want to live in the caves", "36:25", "actually or something like that you'd", "36:26", "because there's no magnetic field there", "36:29", "so it's quite a high radiation", "36:30", "environment but not too bad it's further", "36:33", "from the Sun than we are", "36:34", "it's not - there are places on Mars that", "36:37", "there's a very deep crater called helis", "36:39", "which is a big impact basin and at the", "36:42", "bottom the the it's so deep you could", "36:44", "fit Everest in it so you put Mount", "36:47", "Everest in there the summit of Everest", "36:49", "wouldn't reach the rim of the crater so", "36:51", "it's just something like I don't know", "36:53", "what it is seven miles deep or somewhat", "36:54", "six miles deep so you could go there and", "36:57", "at the bottom the atmospheric pressure", "36:58", "is so high that you could just about", "37:01", "have liquid water occasionally on the", "37:04", "floor of that crater so it's quite water", "37:07", "sometimes it can be 20 degrees really", "37:09", "yeah Celsius Wow so right now exactly I", "37:14", "was experiencing a serious cold face", "37:16", "right so it can be warmer than Minnesota", "37:18", "and so there are places where it's not", "37:22", "horrendous or Mars you know so the", "37:26", "Martian it's it's kind of really sticky", "37:29", "nuts and sort of bits of it do you watch", "37:32", "those movies and shake your head I like", "37:34", "him I like science fiction you know so", "37:38", "yeah and it's it there I grew up with", "37:39", "Star Wars", "37:40", "that was my when I was 9 years old or", "37:42", "some finite", "37:44", "yeah I'm not having this I did an", "37:47", "argument with Neil deGrasse Titan on", "37:49", "argument but debate with him about", "37:50", "lightsabers once because I claimed that", "37:52", "they're physically probably in principle", "37:54", "there possible", "37:55", "and he was trying to say that down but", "37:58", "they are would they'd have to loop back", "37:59", "around cuz the light's not continuing", "38:02", "like the fact that it goes to a certain", "38:04", "distance and pauses we have a mirror or", "38:07", "something I guess yes something that's", "38:08", "pretty the end of it that's true so it", "38:10", "wouldn't be a different kind of light so", "38:11", "the only point I was making is that", "38:13", "photons particles of light can bounce", "38:16", "off each other hmm so we see that in", "38:18", "really high energy experiments in parts", "38:20", "of accelerators we can collide photons", "38:22", "together so my point was a bit of a", "38:25", "pedantic physicist one but he's because", "38:28", "he it is true that light can bounce off", "38:30", "it", "38:31", "it can hit light right but very very", "38:33", "high energy but when they press their", "38:35", "body to a certain yes I wasn't", "38:39", "that's engineering right I agree with", "38:42", "you I agree with you the distance to it", "38:45", "right so as you're swinging it around", "38:48", "you wouldn't have the leverage of a long", "38:51", "thing so why not make it really long", "38:53", "because it wouldn't be difficult to", "38:55", "swing around like you could stab someone", "38:58", "with a light saber a mile away that's", "39:00", "true", "39:01", "that's just a laser and yes why make it", "39:04", "so short", "39:06", "you have to swing you have to be close", "39:08", "to any person with it it's a silly silly", "39:11", "design you are picking holes correctly", "39:14", "in the engineering part of my the only", "39:17", "point I was making is the physics is", "39:18", "that which i think is quite interesting", "39:21", "his light can bounce off light yes so", "39:25", "but it would have to there would have to", "39:26", "be something that causes it to stop at", "39:28", "the very end yeah yeah yeah which would", "39:32", "be you're right it haven't merit but he", "39:33", "wouldn't look cool with it if there was", "39:34", "a no kind of thing with him what drives", "39:36", "me crazy about Star Wars is not the", "39:39", "lightsabers it's the lasers when they're", "39:41", "shooting the guns I'm like why can I see", "39:43", "that well I can't see bullets yeah this", "39:46", "is we're supposed to be way faster than", "39:48", "a bullet yeah", "39:50", "this because it's like they really slow", "39:55", "off that so angry I feel like this is so", "39:59", "dumb I could go warp speed in this", "40:00", "Millennium Falcon and travel the speed", "40:03", "of light but for whatever reason these", "40:05", "lasers are so slowly you could duck out", "40:07", "of the way of them that's so dumb and", "40:08", "it's not only Star Wars it's everything", "40:10", "every single film does that yeah yeah", "40:14", "it's like it's like films like also I", "40:17", "worked on one of these films years ago", "40:19", "sunshine very underappreciated movie", "40:24", "yeah I think so I think but in that so", "40:27", "they they asked me or Danny said I want", "40:29", "to do it right so I'll do the spacecraft", "40:31", "without any sound so when it's traveling", "40:33", "through space they'll be silent and it", "40:35", "looks shit you know just when you watch", "40:38", "it's the same when when you try and film", "40:40", "astronauts and you and they're in zero-g", "40:43", "and they always move slowly", "40:47", "yeah but it looks silly so this kind of", "40:51", "I suppose it's what audiences have got", "40:53", "used to over the years and so in the end", "40:56", "you happen 2001 which didn't do it", "41:01", "yeah silent in 2001 well Kubrick was a", "41:05", "stickler for science and for he was", "41:09", "apparently he would do complex", "41:10", "mathematics in his spare time", "41:12", "well fascinating guy that must have been", "41:14", "yeah I read that they just and someone", "41:17", "just found an interview didn't they the", "41:18", "other day where he explained the ending", "41:20", "of 2001 I didn't say that yesterday", "41:23", "actually and it was it was kind of a", "41:25", "really simple version of it he just said", "41:27", "well the super intelligent beings take", "41:30", "him in and put him in a zoo basically", "41:33", "and watch him grow old and then send him", "41:36", "back to the earth as a super being", "41:39", "that's the worst explanation at the end", "41:42", "of 2002 one I've ever heard but he was", "41:43", "Kubrick's that's what Kubek said so", "41:45", "there he falls into the monolith yet", "41:49", "they just put him in this room which is", "41:51", "kind of a bad version of a French", "41:53", "chateau or something watch him grow old", "41:56", "and then send him back to the earth is a", "41:57", "super being Wow okay that was Kubrick's", "42:01", "yeah", "42:03", "it's uh it's a it's a weird genre right", "42:07", "because sometimes people get things", "42:09", "right like didn't HG Wells predict a", "42:12", "significant amount of scientific", "42:14", "inventions in the future well there was", "42:18", "he said I mean depends which one doesn't", "42:20", "it there was a moon one wasn't though he", "42:21", "did M agenda to the moon I mean his time", "42:24", "machine is no right to do that really", "42:27", "worked out yet so yeah I think it's I I", "42:32", "always liked science fiction yeah I like", "42:34", "arthur c clarke a lot you know cuz i i", "42:37", "think it is you're right it's a a form", "42:41", "that you can let your imagination wander", "42:44", "and address things that restriction i", "42:46", "think did you like the alien series i", "42:47", "loved it yes I leave when I was at", "42:51", "school he's 1979 and we had a school", "42:54", "film Club in the 70s they weren't like", "42:56", "they are now we don't", "42:57", "so the first films they put on the three", "42:59", "films I was a 11 and it was alien", "43:01", "Apocalypse Now in Life of Brian Wow", "43:03", "which I that was my introduction to wow", "43:07", "those are three great choices but I feel", "43:10", "like really Scott's original alien is", "43:12", "probably one of the greatest horror", "43:14", "science fiction movies of all time one", "43:16", "of my all-time favorite movies but I", "43:18", "really like the newer ones as well like", "43:20", "Pete I like Prometheus and I really like", "43:22", "covenant the the last one", "43:24", "yeah Prometheus I don't know I yeah it's", "43:26", "not the best one I look they're like", "43:28", "what they're trying to do with it the", "43:29", "whole idea about the engineers coming", "43:31", "back in time and that's it that's why I", "43:33", "was disappointed with it because I", "43:35", "thought this set up the opening is", "43:36", "brilliant and I thought this is just", "43:39", "going to be brilliant right then I", "43:40", "thought it just lost its way and it was", "43:43", "a disappointment because it could have", "43:45", "been so brilliant yes I agree with you", "43:47", "yeah the beginning was fantastic but I", "43:49", "think covenant was more more exciting", "43:52", "and well it's also preposterous like if", "43:54", "you went to another planet like the last", "43:56", "thing you'd be doing is just breathing", "43:57", "in the air right I mean we'd have to be", "43:59", "really care if there was a life on the", "44:01", "planet", "44:02", "we'd have to be really careful not to", "44:04", "contaminate but be not to be", "44:06", "contaminated right yeah yeah I mean yeah", "44:09", "there's also I mean you know the other", "44:12", "thing in science fiction films is", "44:13", "gravity because you always yeah an alien", "44:16", "you always just say the spaceships got", "44:17", "gravity again there's only 2001 right", "44:20", "where everybody flows around yeah", "44:22", "because all has a spinning thing right", "44:24", "the spaceship has gravity and then when", "44:26", "you land the gravity is exactly like", "44:28", "Earth yeah perfect yeah you know yeah", "44:32", "what are the odds that you would find a", "44:34", "planet that is exactly like even if a", "44:36", "planet was one and a half times the size", "44:38", "of Earth it would have far more gravity", "44:40", "right and that's that's really common", "44:43", "for a planet to be like just a little", "44:45", "bit bigger yeah and then we would be", "44:47", "like the fuck everywhere would be", "44:48", "walking with people we'd be getting", "44:50", "crushed right I agree with you yeah but", "44:54", "that's not the point it's about ideas", "44:55", "yes and you know this whole idea where", "44:59", "you're just supposed to let it let the", "45:01", "you know let the story play out and I", "45:04", "mean sunshine was and you know they put", "45:08", "the premise is is silly I mean it's the", "45:11", "premises the Sun is dying and we're", "45:14", "gonna go and fix it yeah so both of", "45:15", "those things it fails on its first line", "45:18", "a bit in the sense of realism but the", "45:21", "idea is that it's not about that it's", "45:22", "about it's about the it's about the Sun", "45:27", "as a God in some ways so it's about our", "45:29", "response to the power of nature and it's", "45:31", "about defying this thing and worshiping", "45:35", "it and how ultimately you go mad if you", "45:37", "remember the film there's pin backer", "45:39", "who's the first captain that went to the", "45:40", "captain the first mission to go and", "45:42", "restart the Sun which is the mad bit", "45:44", "mm-hmm but then became a religious", "45:47", "fundamentalist essentially and then", "45:49", "decided it's a fascinating idea that he", "45:51", "decides to bring meaning to his life he", "45:54", "will become the last the last man the", "45:56", "last human and so he wants to be the", "46:00", "last he wants the Sun to die and he", "46:03", "wants it to take humanity with it and he", "46:06", "decided to make that happen so he stays", "46:08", "there waiting for the second ship I like", "46:11", "those ideas that you know that what's", "46:13", "your reaction to the power of nature", "46:15", "this it after him one of the things that", "46:18", "in my shows I'm not being a commercial", "46:19", "person I just thought one of the great", "46:22", "things about cosmology is that it is", "46:24", "terrifying in the in the truest sense of", "46:27", "the word when we talked a bit about the", "46:28", "size and scale of the universe and black", "46:30", "holes come", "46:31", "those things you know it is very", "46:34", "frightening but also the I think the act", "46:39", "of trying to understand our place in", "46:41", "nature and the size and scale of the", "46:44", "universe now our your tiny presence", "46:48", "within it is valuable it's a it's a so", "46:52", "that you can be terrified but also", "46:54", "inspired and interested and it's part of", "46:57", "if you want to find if you want to ask", "47:00", "questions about what it means to be", "47:01", "human and means to be alive then I think", "47:04", "you find the answers in confronting that", "47:07", "reality which is that we live in a", "47:09", "terrifyingly vast universe the palette", "47:12", "powers in the universe that we cannot", "47:15", "comprehend as you said but that that", "47:17", "that's what you've got to face because", "47:19", "that's reality so you can't hide your", "47:21", "head in the sand and just duck it and it", "47:23", "sends some it can send some people crazy", "47:25", "I'm sure it is really interesting that", "47:28", "we need that suspension of disbelief in", "47:30", "order to sort of make a film on space", "47:34", "you you almost have to like oh well this", "47:37", "isn't really how it be but this is how", "47:40", "you have to make it in order to fit it", "47:42", "into a two-hour movie yeah and then and", "47:44", "then the film as we sunshine becomes", "47:46", "about you then you can have the film", "47:48", "about something else yes it's not really", "47:50", "about that well did you like a event", "47:52", "horizon yeah I did actually", "47:56", "I always wanted to ask about their their", "48:00", "concept of propulsion that you that", "48:03", "almost like space would be flat you", "48:05", "would fold space over and you would", "48:07", "intersect those two points and you would", "48:09", "be able to travel vast distances", "48:11", "instantaneously right and I'm doing a", "48:13", "terrible job of explaining I'm sure but", "48:15", "is that a concept that people have", "48:17", "actually considered yeah you can in in", "48:20", "general relativity so so I instance I", "48:22", "should say what it is Einsteins theory", "48:24", "general relativity is our best theory of", "48:26", "space and time and so it really is as we", "48:29", "talked about before it's you imagine", "48:31", "space and time as a sheet just imagine", "48:34", "it as a thing sort of literally a sheet", "48:37", "surface and all the theory says is that", "48:40", "if you put matter and/or energy into", "48:43", "that then it curbs it", "48:44", "and distorts it and it can stretch it", "48:46", "and make it shrink and so it's the", "48:49", "response of space and time to matter and", "48:51", "energy so if you if you the simplest", "48:54", "version will be the Sun so you put the", "48:56", "big spherical ball of stuff in there and", "48:58", "it warps face and time such that the", "49:02", "nice straight lines something just", "49:04", "traveling - Oh in business through that", "49:06", "warp space turns into an orbit and", "49:08", "that's why you can actually kind of see", "49:10", "things that are behind the Sun yeah okay", "49:12", "so light bends around the Sun because", "49:15", "it's just traveling through the curved", "49:17", "space the earth goes around the Sun", "49:19", "because it's just rolling minding its", "49:21", "own business through the curved space so", "49:23", "an example would be you might say well", "49:27", "how does a curved space", "49:28", "how does can that give rise to something", "49:30", "looks like a force she's gravity so the", "49:33", "best analogy I know of is to think of", "49:34", "walking around on the surface of the", "49:36", "earth so if you stand on the equator of", "49:38", "the earth and you'd you with your friend", "49:40", "and you say we're gonna walk Joo North", "49:42", "so we're gonna set off let's say we're a", "49:45", "thousand miles apart on the equator and", "49:47", "we're gonna walk Joo North and what's", "49:48", "going to happen so you walk in straight", "49:50", "lines you don't change direction you", "49:52", "don't give any accelerating but the", "49:54", "straight lines are lines of longitude on", "49:56", "the surface of the earth so as you go", "49:58", "further and further north you get closer", "50:00", "and closer together and if you carry on", "50:01", "to the pole you bump into each other", "50:03", "mm-hmm but nothing's happened", "50:05", "no one's know and there's no forces", "50:07", "acting it's just that you're moving on a", "50:09", "curved surface and so you get closer and", "50:12", "that's basically Einstein's theory of", "50:14", "general relativity now why did I start", "50:17", "talking about event horizon the idea of", "50:19", "oh yeah so so you can so all you have to", "50:23", "do so that those folded kind of", "50:25", "geometries is you have to try and", "50:27", "specify how where you would put the", "50:29", "matter and what kind of stuff you'd put", "50:31", "there to make the geometry fold in that", "50:34", "way and you can do it you can do it so", "50:37", "you can you can write down that geometry", "50:39", "it's called a warp drive geometry I", "50:41", "think is called that is in textbooks so", "50:44", "you can do that to have a warp drive the", "50:47", "question becomes what sort of stuff", "50:49", "would you have to actually put into the", "50:52", "real universe to make it warp in that", "50:54", "way and it always it usually turns out", "50:58", "that", "50:58", "the kind of stuff that doesn't exist", "50:59", "right but it has properties it's math", "51:02", "sort of matter or sort of energy that", "51:04", "has properties that do not exist in", "51:06", "nature as far as we can tell but you can", "51:09", "still write the geometry down in", "51:11", "Einstein's theory so if you had mystical", "51:13", "force or mass or whatever it is if you", "51:15", "had that stuff that doesn't exist it is", "51:18", "a concept that yeah so the geometry", "51:20", "exists so you can you can you can do it", "51:23", "and you can do the calculations and you", "51:24", "can see the warp drive you can construct", "51:27", "wormholes that connect distant regions", "51:29", "of the universe which you could use as", "51:31", "time machines and you can do all that in", "51:34", "the theory but in nature you'd have to", "51:37", "have the right stuff to do it but that", "51:39", "stuff is not real that seems to be as", "51:41", "far as we know yeah now what would have", "51:43", "to happen like the you would have to", "51:45", "have enough power or mass to be able to", "51:49", "fold those two things together like it", "51:51", "tends to be weird stuff like an stuff", "51:54", "that has a negative pressure or", "51:56", "something like that so stuff that has", "51:58", "physical properties that are just", "52:00", "bizarre", "52:01", "and that no matter our energy that we", "52:04", "know of in the universe has so that that", "52:06", "to make to make the geometry happen but", "52:09", "it's conceivable in theory that this", "52:12", "could exist even though it doesn't it's", "52:15", "it it said it said the very altom utley", "52:18", "and so wormholes are a good example so", "52:21", "that would be quite literally it we've", "52:22", "talked about the surface of the earth so", "52:25", "you fly to Australia from LA and you", "52:27", "have to go quite a long way around this", "52:28", "edge of the earth oh you could tunnel", "52:30", "straight through and get there quicker", "52:32", "see that's a worse name he's got a", "52:34", "little graphic up there and there it is", "52:37", "so you could go all the way around the", "52:39", "edge or you could cut

I've said is right and the", "58:08", "way we find out is to find life or", "58:10", "evidence of past life are you aware of", "58:13", "the speculation that was going around", "58:15", "how was it that occupy thing the octopus", "58:21", "eggs they there was a group of", "58:23", "scientists that were speculating that", "58:25", "it's pop you know panspermia the idea of", "58:28", "panspermia that it's possible that", "58:29", "octopi had come from somewhere else some", "58:33", "frozen eggs had actually come from", "58:35", "somewhere else and and landed on earth", "58:37", "and these are like legitimate scientists", "58:39", "are contemplated not morons I don't", "58:41", "think I've seen this the now I didn't", "58:44", "but I mean it I think suddenly so", "58:46", "panspermia doesn't have to be unlikely", "58:48", "right I mean for example you might seen", "58:49", "the other day we found an earth rock on", "58:51", "the moon", "58:51", "yes right well the earth now because he", "58:53", "probably know it's probably back didn't", "58:55", "they missed four billion years old or", "58:56", "something one of the oldest rocks ever", "58:58", "found yeah so we know that material gets", "59:00", "transferred between planets and so it's", "59:03", "not inconceivable that microbes could", "59:05", "survive that journey we know that", "59:08", "microbes can survive in space for", "59:10", "example so that isn't mad it's probably", "59:14", "unlikely but he's not mad but with the", "59:16", "octopus", "59:16", "I didn't heard that but the thing is", "59:18", "that the octopus is still extremely", "59:20", "similar biologically to us I mean the", "59:23", "differences are negligible yeah so it's", "59:25", "still got the same energy system with a", "59:27", "single ATP in DNA you know aster it's", "59:30", "all very very similar it was something", "59:31", "about RNA and DNA did you find that", "59:34", "article I'm looking at a different one", "59:35", "for certain websites about the same", "59:37", "thing I did with the Cambrian explosion", "59:38", "and there were 33 authors on a paper", "59:42", "that got published in the progress and", "59:44", "biophysics and molecular biology that", "59:47", "talked about this possibility there are", "59:49", "other people that disagree with it", "59:50", "though I mean I suppose the I haven't", "59:52", "seen it", "59:52", "so I think it's unlikely because the", "59:54", "octopus is extremely similar to us so", "59:57", "that suggests a common origin to me", "59:58", "there suppose the counter-argument you", "60:02", "could you could advance would be there's", "60:04", "only one way to do life so you could say", "60:07", "they're actually given because the laws", "60:09", "of physics and chemistry are the same", "60:10", "everywhere so maybe it's maybe DNA is", "60:15", "the only way to do it so that's the way", "60:17", "it gets done which is why they're so", "60:19", "similar to us yes all those so alien as", "60:21", "well yeah they're not though you know", "60:25", "that's the thing about so that's why I'm", "60:26", "surprised about it because they're not", "60:28", "that alien they're very similar well", "60:30", "there are in their abilities I mean", "60:32", "their ability to transform their outer", "60:34", "texture and their color instant almost", "60:36", "instantaneously oh yeah I mean they have", "60:38", "incredible camouflage abilities that", "60:40", "really don't exist in the mammalian", "60:42", "world yeah but I'll sell you a level you", "60:45", "look at an octopus cell in among under a", "60:47", "microscope and you wouldn't be able to", "60:48", "tell the dish", "60:49", "so you know it's for sale and humans so", "60:51", "the only way that that would make sense", "60:52", "as if all life comes from basically the", "60:55", "same kind of building blocks and just", "60:56", "varies depending upon the conditions and", "60:59", "where it takes place", "61:00", "I'm guessing but yes that must be the", "61:03", "the only way you could sustain that", "61:04", "given that they're so similar see was", "61:06", "because they really are biochemically is", "61:10", "that that's the only way it can be done", "61:12", "given the given the building block the", "61:15", "toolkit the laws of nature and the the", "61:17", "elements and so on that we have in our", "61:19", "universe we have so many different life", "61:21", "forms on our planet but if we found", "61:22", "anything that's remotely similar to what", "61:25", "we have here on earth", "61:26", "on another planet it would be such an", "61:27", "incredible discovery like we sent if we", "61:30", "found a frog on the moon I mean the", "61:33", "world would stop right I'd be very", "61:35", "surprised if we found anything anywhere", "61:38", "that is any in any way similar an insect", "61:41", "on Mars well this is I mean it as I said", "61:44", "it be micro I didn't be single-celled", "61:46", "things remember I mean you mentioned the", "61:47", "Cambrian explosion so that is that what", "61:50", "we do know that Earth is that although", "61:51", "life began let's say 3.9 billion years", "61:54", "ago it wasn't until around 600 million", "61:56", "years ago or so that or maybe most seven", "62:00", "hundred that you see any complex", "62:02", "multicellular organisms that's all", "62:05", "so first something like 3 billion years", "62:07", "it was single-celled alone and that's", "62:10", "one of the reasons why I would guess if", "62:13", "I had to guess I would say that microbes", "62:15", "would be common because life began very", "62:17", "quickly on earth and I would be", "62:19", "surprised to find it on Mars but complex", "62:21", "life multicellular life insects plants", "62:26", "intelligence", "62:27", "I would guess will be very rare because", "62:29", "it took so long on earth to get there", "62:33", "who doesn't slime about 3 billion years", "62:36", "of slime that was it what happened how", "62:41", "did it go from slime to giraffes", "62:43", "it's a very quickly once it once it got", "62:47", "going", "62:47", "yeah and it's one of the great unsolved", "62:49", "mysteries in biology the one thing that", "62:52", "is true is that we seem to be all", "62:54", "complex creatures seem to be we call", "62:58", "eukaryotes right rusa cells with a cell", "63:00", "nucleus and all that kind of stuff and", "63:02", "they look like they're the merger", "63:04", "between two simpler life-forms bacteria", "63:08", "and a thing called an archaea and our", "63:10", "Keun so it looks like somewhere in two", "63:14", "billion years ago whatever it was in", "63:16", "some ocean the bacterial cell got inside", "63:20", "the archein and survived as a symbiotic", "63:25", "organism essentially and then somehow", "63:29", "unbelievably managed to reproduce and", "63:32", "replicate in that configuration and that", "63:35", "does seem to be the origin of all", "63:36", "complex multicellular life on Earth so", "63:38", "it's called the fateful encounter", "63:40", "hypothesis and then if that's true then", "63:44", "it's just a bit of look any happen once", "63:47", "right and that's why we're here now when", "63:50", "lined look consider like how many", "63:52", "billion earth-like planets did you say", "63:55", "exist just our solar system alone in the", "63:57", "galaxy 20 billion something like that so", "63:59", "well intense towers so the odds of", "64:02", "complex life out of our incredibly", "64:04", "fortunate situation but the odds of that", "64:07", "occurring on any of these billions of", "64:09", "other planets that exist we don't know", "64:12", "but let's say the earth is let's say it", "64:15", "was on the fortunate side so we're with", "64:19", "talking about give or take four billion", "64:20", "years right from the origin of life to", "64:22", "now and we have a civilization now and", "64:24", "we've had it our species have been", "64:26", "around what a quite a million years or", "64:27", "something so it's just now basically so", "64:30", "let's say four billion is on the", "64:31", "fortunate side let's say that it was", "64:34", "double that or triple that on the", "64:36", "average suddenly that's the age of the", "64:38", "universe right that's a third of the age", "64:41", "of the universe so how many of those", "64:44", "worlds have been stable for three or", "64:47", "four billion years that that's quite a", "64:50", "tall order actually it looks like our", "64:52", "solar system might be quite unusual in", "64:55", "that respect because it could the", "64:56", "planets got to remain stable in a stable", "64:59", "orbit the Stars got to remain stable the", "65:02", "large mean stabilizes yeah Jupiter plays", "65:06", "a big role", "65:07", "take some roots yeah sucks a moon so and", "65:11", "that you know that there's a thing", "65:12", "there's a theory called the grand tech", "65:14", "theory which is so it's very hard to", "65:17", "explain the evolution of our solar", "65:19", "system so that when you do computer", "65:21", "models of solar systems you don't tend", "65:23", "to get for rocky planets too close to", "65:25", "the Sun and for big gas giants further", "65:27", "out and one of the current best theories", "65:30", "and this I say this because it shows you", "65:32", "how look you we might be is that Jupiter", "65:35", "that they tend to form these big gas", "65:36", "giants and migrated inwards towards the", "65:39", "star so you know I must all the computer", "65:41", "simulations just because you've got this", "65:42", "big gas giant orbiting all the dust", "65:44", "around the star they tend to drop", "65:46", "inwards and it looks like Jupiter did", "65:49", "that so it looks like it formed and came", "65:51", "in and came in almost to where Mars", "65:53", "orbits today and and cleared out the", "65:56", "region around Mars actually which is", "65:58", "maybe the reason Mars is so small", "66:00", "compared to the other so it's a Venus", "66:02", "and Earth oh but then Saturn was coming", "66:04", "in as well and in the computer models", "66:07", "the interaction between Jupiter and", "66:09", "Saturn stopped Jupiter coming in before", "66:12", "it gets to the earth and they both get", "66:15", "dragged out again and so it to where", "66:17", "they are today and so that and that that", "66:20", "seems to be it's one of the best", "66:22", "theories for the evolution of our solar", "66:24", "system so what are the chances you know", "66:26", "that the chances of that are so mini", "66:30", "school might tiny so", "66:32", "that's the thing I think about these", "66:34", "rocky planets you in order to get a", "66:36", "civilization on them I think you need I", "66:39", "guess you need quite unusual solar", "66:42", "systems and that would be a guess and", "66:44", "you need quite unusual stability on the", "66:47", "planet for billions of years and that's", "66:50", "why I think we might be quite lucky mmm", "66:53", "and how does bodes law work bodes law is", "66:57", "a method of detecting if you look at the", "66:59", "mass of a planet you can accurately", "67:01", "detect how much mass and the size of a", "67:05", "neighboring planet I think it wasn't", "67:06", "just the positions of the orbits I think", "67:09", "right where it is yeah", "67:11", "and it's one thing that is true about", "67:14", "our solar system is that you if you get", "67:16", "the computer simulations you can't put", "67:18", "more planets in if you try and fill put", "67:20", "more planets in they become it becomes", "67:22", "unstable very quickly so that the mass", "67:24", "of like if you measure Mars you can", "67:27", "accurately depict where the next planet", "67:31", "close to it would be it it was I mean it", "67:33", "was that's what was done was it 17th", "67:36", "century or so long yeah it was just one", "67:39", "of those things where you know it's a", "67:40", "pattern they were just trying to fit", "67:42", "just a pattern which is an you know not", "67:46", "there's nothing to that really other", "67:49", "than to say that most simulations of the", "67:53", "solar system if there are if you put", "67:55", "other planets in they tend to get thrown", "67:57", "out by gravitational interactions so", "68:00", "there is a sense in which our solar", "68:02", "system has got as much stuff in it as it", "68:03", "could have so the planets are nicely", "68:05", "spaced and you're right given the mass", "68:07", "of them that depends on how close", "68:09", "another planet can be before the", "68:11", "interaction goes wrong and it gets", "68:12", "thrown out into the intergalactic space", "68:15", "I some because mannix do that you know", "68:17", "we we know that planets get thrown out", "68:19", "of solar systems by gravitational", "68:21", "interactions so yeah so it again it", "68:26", "points to the fact that solar systems", "68:28", "are not are not stable over long periods", "68:31", "of time they're not like clockwork", "68:33", "things not like you know Newtonian", "68:35", "clockwork and it just goes on forever", "68:37", "they're not like that that they evolve", "68:40", "and planets can shift orbits and change", "68:42", "and one we know", "68:44", "you look at the surface of the Moon for", "68:46", "example it's covered in craters and that", "68:48", "was cause they all seem to hit about the", "68:50", "same time and it's about 3.8 billion", "68:54", "years ago or so and that's called the", "68:56", "late heavy bombardment so we know that", "68:58", "if you look at cratering rates on Mars", "69:01", "and on the moon", "69:01", "it all seems happening this all but a", "69:04", "big peak around that time and that seems", "69:07", "to be correlated with Neptune moving", "69:09", "outwards in the solar system and into", "69:12", "Kuiper belt basically are towards the", "69:14", "Kuiper belt and causing all sorts of", "69:16", "havoc and everything comes into the", "69:17", "inner solar system so those things", "69:19", "happen and it but it didn't happen when", "69:22", "life was established on the earth so", "69:25", "it's all extremely old stuff that this", "69:27", "is shifting textbook but how long is how", "69:30", "long's the solar system been in this", "69:31", "particularly stable situation that's in", "69:33", "now it's it's since about 3.8 billion", "69:36", "years ago so if it had been unstable at", "69:40", "any point since then", "69:41", "then we likely wouldn't be here right do", "69:44", "you think that it's possible do you ever", "69:47", "entertain the idea that it's possible", "69:48", "that we are the only intelligent life in", "69:50", "the known universe III like I said", "69:54", "Teresa I tend to restrict myself to the", "69:56", "galaxies so I do think it's possible", "69:59", "that at the moment there's one", "70:01", "civilization in the Milky Way and that's", "70:03", "us and I

something to us so that's kind", "71:13", "of a an obvious statement your life", "71:15", "means something to you and me and so", "71:18", "meaning exists but I think it is a local", "71:22", "and temporary phenomenon I think it's it", "71:24", "emerges meaning emerges from", "71:27", "configurations of atoms which is what we", "71:30", "are we are simply that we nothing more", "71:33", "than that we're very very rare", "71:35", "configurations of atoms I think and so", "71:39", "that means that we are if you go all the", "71:43", "way down that line of logic we are the", "71:45", "only Island meaning in the galaxy I'm", "71:48", "meaning only to ourselves yeah it means", "71:52", "something to us because we're the only", "71:54", "ones who can grasp the concept and we", "71:57", "are finite we are finite organism we", "72:00", "have this temporary existence while", "72:01", "we're here and to us there is meaning", "72:04", "yeah and that's I don't know any other", "72:06", "way to define it right so I'll define it", "72:08", "like that yes I don't think there's a", "72:10", "globe yeah otherwise you have to believe", "72:12", "there's some kind of global meaning and", "72:14", "that's a god type mingun I don't think", "72:17", "that's I think it's more wonderful and", "72:19", "and more challenging to us because we", "72:22", "have to take responsibility for it to", "72:24", "say we should operate such that we are", "72:27", "it in this galaxy mmm there's nothing", "72:30", "else I'm sure I'm just I'm sure there", "72:33", "are other civilizations out there in the", "72:35", "universe because there are two trillion", "72:36", "galaxies I I just can't believe this", "72:39", "hasn't happened in other places the", "72:41", "question is how often does it happen and", "72:43", "how widely spaced our civilizations and", "72:46", "I think they're very widely spaced and I", "72:49", "think there may be one or two per galaxy", "72:51", "on the average I could but that as you", "72:54", "said it that what you said it basically", "72:56", "that what else can we think right well", "72:59", "then what else do you want I mean I", "73:00", "think what it says is you have to take", "73:02", "responsibility for all those things as", "73:05", "spiritual things that you think about", "73:06", "and the emotional things you think about", "73:08", "it you you are you are responsible for", "73:12", "that you are that like that whatever", "73:15", "that is", "73:15", "it exists in you and it will only exist", "73:18", "for short amount of time", "73:20",

wouldn't", "73:54", "you want to see what that's like yeah I", "73:55", "mean we so compelling you imagine the", "73:57", "timescales we've been around as a", "73:59", "civilization let's let's give it say", "74:00", "forty thousand years I don't know long", "74:02", "our civilization has been around let's", "74:03", "say that the the galaxy is pretty much", "74:07", "as old as the universe it's thirteen", "74:09", "billion years worth of time so the idea", "74:14", "that there are no no civilization zeros", "74:16", "you know 100 million years ago 200", "74:19", "million years ago", "74:19",

the", "74:52", "future", "74:52", "so I would it's one of the arguments", "74:54", "often used to say there aren't any", "74:56", "civilizations out there in the galaxy", "74:58", "it's called the Fermi paradox because if", "75:00", "you imagine a civilization that's a", "75:02", "million years ahead of us they should", "75:04", "have written their presence across the", "75:05", "sky by now they should used to see him I", "75:08", "mean you'll see us leave we survived a", "75:10", "million years into the future actually", "75:13", "even a few thousand years into the", "75:15", "future we will be exploring the galaxy", "75:18", "we will have spacecraft that are going", "75:20", "to of the stars we will be doing it so", "75:22", "our signature will become visible I'm", "75:24", "sure if we last", "75:26", "into the medium said would we choose to", "75:29", "not do that here's my thought on that is", "75:33", "uncontacted tribes like do you know", "75:35", "about the the gentleman who was the", "75:38", "missionary who visited North Sentinel", "75:39", "island yeah it was killed by the natives", "75:41", "North Sentinel island which is a really", "75:43", "unusual place because

about 39 of them left", "75:54", "somewhere around there", "75:55", "and we can't we're not supposed to", "75:58", "contact them like people are not", "76:00", "supposed to like leave them alone and",

alone do you think that", "76:12", "perhaps a universe like if there is a", "76:14", "civilization that's a million times more", "76:16", "advanced than awesome been around here", "76:18", "for you know millions of years of life", "76:20", "as opposed to quarter million why would", "76:23", "they why would they let us know like", "76:26", "will they look at us dropping bombs on", "76:27", "each other and polluting the ocean", "76:29", "sucking all the fish out and putting", "76:32", "clouds into the skies of dirt and", "76:34", "particles and why would they look at", "76:37", "these crude monkeys look at their data", "76:38", "they're so far beyond where they need to", "76:41", "be before they could join the Galactic", "76:43", "Civilizations", "76:45", "it is true it's an argument that there", "76:48", "is an argument as well that it", "76:50", "technology's so advanced would be", "76:53", "difficult for us to detect I mean we", "76:55", "tend to think of you know when you say", "76:57", "written across the sky I suppose it's", "76:58", "true I'm thinking of starships like Star", "77:01", "Wars right big energy things that you", "77:03", "can see the signature of but actually", "77:05", "maybe the civilization just becomes a", "77:07", "nano civilization a tiny little nano but", "77:10", "because that's more inefficient it's a", "77:12", "better way to do things", "77:13", "so it's possible I suppose then there", "77:16", "are space probes all over the place", "77:18", "they're so small and it's so efficient", "77:20", "and use so little energy that we just", "77:22", "don't see them I suppose that is", "77:24", "possible my other thought is that where", "77:27", "we are headed it seems to me that", "77:29", "there's some sort of a strange symbiosis", "77:31", "that's taking place there's there's a", "77:34", "strange connection that we have to", "77:36", "electronics and ultimately to an", "77:38", "artificial creation or", "77:40", "official

but", "77:51", "also acts like life yeah that this may", "77:54", "be the future of life that we are so", "77:57", "connected to the idea of flesh and blood", "78:00", "and bone but maybe this is just a", "78:03", "temporary situation until we transition", "78:06", "or if not us transition till it", "78:09", "surpasses us and this is the next stage", "78:11", "of life but this stage has no need for", "78:15", "all the human and biological reward", "78:17", "systems are in place that made sure that", "78:19", "we survive whether it's ego or fear or", "78:21", "emotions no need for that", "78:24", "that it will just exist and maintain its", "78:27", "equilibrium as this this new form of", "78:31", "life and this is the future of life in", "78:33", "the universe and it will get there maybe", "78:35", "we'll only be a hundred two hundred", "78:37", "years from now but that that's what", "78:39", "exists all throughout the cosmos so", "78:40", "there's no need to peacock there's no", "78:42", "need to show our sin on the sky and that", "78:46", "it just exists in this form yeah I agree", "78:49", "I wouldn't be surprised yes that's the", "78:53", "that's the counter-argument to the this", "78:56", "Fermi paradox argument that I talks", "78:58", "about well exactly as you've just said", "79:00", "there basically you evolved to a point", "79:02", "very rapidly where you just don't create", "79:04", "a signature yes and you don't really get", "79:06", "involved as you said maybe just yeah", "79:13", "well there's no motivation right like it", "79:15", "doesn't our motivations are also weird", "79:17", "right we have these biological", "79:19", "motivations to survive and you know", "79:22", "there's motivations to conquer and to", "79:24", "innovate and to spread our genes and to", "79:26", "move into New Territories but if you", "79:28", "didn't have biology if you were you", "79:31", "existed completely from man-made", "79:34", "materials or from materials found on", "79:36", "earth and that this new form of life was", "79:38", "created out of that I wouldn't have", "79:39", "those unless you programmed them and why", "79:42", "would you do that", "79:43", "it is interesting isn't it too because", "79:46", "we don't know what consciousness is", "79:48", "right so something called a hard problem", "79:50", "in science we don't know so", "79:53", "it's a good question whether you can", "79:55", "build let's say you want to build a", "79:56", "self-replicating machine which is what", "79:58", "you're talking about or something that", "80:00", "can go and maybe go to the moon on Mars", "80:02", "and replicate itself and then carry on", "80:05", "which is a living thing I suppose yes", "80:07", "does it have to have a sufficient level", "80:09", "of intelligence very actually is", "80:12", "conscious and all these things that we", "80:15", "talked about this this word meaning that", "80:17", "we used earlier that we all understand", "80:18", "you can't define is that a emergent", "80:22", "property that that has to emerge if", "80:25", "you've got something that's intelligent", "80:27", "enough to replicate itself and live and", "80:31", "run you said be there I don't know the", "80:34", "answer but it's worth considering that", "80:36", "this thing this what we emotion meaning", "80:40", "love and fear and all those things are", "80:42", "just the things that happen when you are", "80:45", "intelligent right I don't know the", "80:47", "answer to that but it could possibly be", "80:49", "and does consciousness have to have a", "80:53", "local origin like it does it have to", "80:56", "come from a thing like if you think", "80:58", "about cellular communication the the if", "81:02", "you send me if you're in England can you", "81:04", "send me a video from your phone and it", "81:06", "reaches my phone it's getting to me", "81:08", "through space it's going through the sky", "81:11", "it's like literally from a device not", "81:14", "connected by any wires or anything it's", "81:16", "coming to me", "81:18", "if if there's a possibility to create", "81:20", "some sort of global intelligence through", "81:24", "electronics that's non-local if one", "81:26", "piece of it falls off there's the same", "81:28", "it is it just repairs itself or figures", "81:31", "itself out but it's the same", "81:33", "consciousness existing on a global scale", "81:36", "through some sort of an electronic", "81:37", "network that instead of the idea that", "81:40", "you and I have that Brian and Joe are do", "81:43", "you have your mind I have my mind and we", "81:45", "we exist as intelligent being separate", "81:48", "from each other but instead of that that", "81:51", "all of it is connected and that all of", "81:53", "it is something that we can't even", "81:56", "conceive of because our brains are too", "81:59", "crude like trying to explain to you know", "82:01", "Australia Pittacus what a satellite is", "82:04", "yeah", "82:06", "yeah I mean yes I mean if you think", "82:08", "about our brains they are ultimately", "82:11", "what are they they're just a distributed", "82:13", "network of cells connected by neurons", "82:15", "and I mean they're very complicated but", "82:17", "they are a colony of things that are", "82:20", "autonomous in a sense and they're", "82:21", "communicating with each other so yeah I", "82:23", "don't I don't see why you can't scale", "82:25", "that up in principle I mean I should", "82:27", "just err the caveat is always that we", "82:29", "don't know we don't yes it's easy it's", "82:32", "just not understood well I think there's", "82:35", "something weird has physics although I'm", "82:36", "damn sure it's physical I'm damn sure", "82:38", "that there's nothing going on in my head", "82:41", "other than what is allowed by the laws", "82:44", "of nature as we understand them I'm sure", "82:47", "you mean the idea of a soul being some", "82:50", "sort of a divine thing that's inside the", "82:52", "housing of the body yeah I mean I I know", "82:55", "I would say we can rule that out", "82:56", "actually", "82:57", "I've out in the past how do you rule it", "83:00", "I've argued we can rule that out in the", "83:02", "following manner so so it's my arm right", "83:05", "so it's made of electrons and protons", "83:07", "and neutrons and if I if I have a soul", "83:10", "in there something that we don't", "83:11", "understand but it's a different kind of", "83:13", "energy or whatever it is first we don't", "83:15", "have in physics at the moment it", "83:18", "interacts with matter because I'm moving", "83:19", "my hand around so whatever it is it's", "83:23", "something that interacts very strongly", "83:25", "with matter but if you look at the", "83:28", "history of particle physics in", "83:30", "particular which is the study of matter", "83:31", "we spend we spent decades making", "83:35", "high-precision measurements of how", "83:36", "matter behaves and interacts and we look", "83:39", "for it for example for a fifth force of", "83:41", "nature so we know four forces for", "83:43", "gravity the two nuclear forces call the", "83:46", "weak and strong nuclear forces and", "83:47", "electromagnetism and that's what we know", "83:50", "exists and we look for another one with", "83:53", "ultra-high precision and we don't see", "83:55", "any evidence of it so I would claim that", "83:58", "we know how matter interacts at these", "84:01", "energies it's a room temperature now", "84:03", "these Angele we know how matter", "84:05", "interacts very precisely and so if you", "84:08", "want to suggest there's something else", "84:10", "that interacts with matter strongly then", "84:13", "I would say that it's ruled out I would", "84:16", "go as far to say it is ruled out by", "84:18", "experiments", "84:19", "or at least is his extremely subtle and", "84:21", "you would have to jump through a lot of", "84:23", "Hoops to come up with a theory of some", "84:25", "stuff that we wouldn't have seen when", "84:28", "we've observed how matter interacts that", "84:30", "is present in our bodies and presumably", "84:34", "we believe in the soul you want it to", "84:36", "exist outside when you die you still", "84:37", "want the thing to be there and you might", "84:39", "believe in ghosts and things like that", "84:41", "like a ghost I mean it's a it is", "84:43", "something that carries the imprint of", "84:44", "you presumably it looks like you right", "84:47", "so that means that it interacts strongly", "84:50", "with the matter that is you because it", "84:52", "carries a patent if it carries a pattern", "84:54", "it carries information if it carries", "84:56", "information there has to be an energy", "84:58", "source that allows that information to", "84:59", "persist in the pattern to persist and so", "85:01", "on so again you end up with a a theory", "85:04", "that is postulating something it", "85:07", "interacts with light because if you", "85:09", "think a ghost is the soul then it's", "85:12", "something that people see sometimes so", "85:14", "that means it interacts with light but", "85:17", "we know how light interacts and we ruled", "85:19", "out anything but the most subtle further", "85:24", "interaction that we haven't seen so I", "85:26", "would I claim and I started off as a", "85:28", "joke this actually I wrote it in an", "85:30", "infinite monkey cage book this radio", "85:31", "show that I do but he ended up when I'd", "85:34", "written it down I thought actually that", "85:36", "it makes sense and I read some is", "85:38", "similar actually I think I'm Sean", "85:40", "Carroll II I don't have you've had Sean", "85:41", "yes shareable dumps he he's said", "85:44", "something the same I think in the book", "85:45", "they wrote the big picture I think he", "85:46", "has a similar argument actually so it's", "85:49", "occurred to him as well it's roughly the", "85:51", "same argument so if you so this energy", "85:56", "that's interacting with matter even if", "85:58", "you're not moving at all if you're just", "86:00", "thinking it's interacting with the", "86:02", "matter that encompasses your mind or", "86:04", "your brain or your nerves or your", "86:06", "neurons yeah it's something in there", "86:09", "that's interacting with matter whether", "86:11", "you like it or not so even just a simple", "86:14", "thought process or a dream is still", "86:16", "something that's interacting with Matt", "86:18", "yeah well obviously because it you know", "86:21", "you your will isn't it presumably right", "86:25", "so even but even if you're not moving", "86:26", "the idea like the you're saying you're", "86:28", "like your body's interacting with matter", "86:29", "as you're moving your arm but even if", "86:31", "you're not moving if you", "86:32", "just thinking and you're completely", "86:34", "still which is not totally possible cuz", "86:36", "your hearts beating and your breathing", "86:37", "and all that stuff but if somehow or", "86:39", "another you were able to isolate just", "86:42", "the thought the thoughts themselves are", "86:44", "still interacting with matter because", "86:46", "they're interacting with the brain", "86:47", "itself", "86:48", "yeah so there's something in there", "86:49", "there's something that interacts with", "86:51", "the physical structure of your body and", "86:52", "and and I would say there isn't so", "86:57", "that's the whoo-whoo version is that the", "87:02", "brain itself and the body the physical", "87:04", "so this this this spiritual self you are", "87:08", "merely an antenna that's tuning into the", "87:11", "the the great consciousness of the", "87:14", "universe but why but then you have to", "87:17", "answer what it we know what we are made", "87:20", "of yes oh we know how those particles", "87:22", "behave and interact so so why do the", "87:25", "particles not in any way interact with", "87:29", "that stuff because we interact we don't", "87:31", "if that's true we don't only just", "87:33", "interact with it we interact extremely", "87:36", "strongly with it we're interacting with", "87:38", "it now yeah every movement I make is the", "87:41", "interaction between those every matter", "87:43", "yeah yes what everything if I move my", "87:46", "fingers everything that I'm doing right", "87:48", "is an interaction between that stuff and", "87:50", "me so it's a very strong interaction", "87:52", "with matter but we don't see it in all", "87:55", "our precision measurement well the", "87:58", "answer for that dancer is because it's", "88:00", "not there the answer is Jesus and you", "88:02", "can't measure God that may be an answer", "88:06", "but the point is you as we talked about", "88:08", "earlier with absolute space yeah if you", "88:10", "can't measure it yeah it's not there hmm", "88:14", "right it's but for whatever reason for", "88:19", "people there is some incredible", "88:21", "motivation to find a divine something or", "88:27", "another that's there's something greater", "88:30", "than this physical being there's", "88:32", "something what do you think that is like", "88:34", "what is that compulsion we we've already", "88:36", "sort of talked a bit about it I think it", "88:39", "goes to the the hearts of this question", "88:43", "of what it means to be human", "88:44", "mmm", "88:44", "so I would say that being human the", "88:49", "answer to the it's not the answer to the", "88:53", "meaning but it an answer would be we are", "88:58", "small finite beings right which are just", "89:02", "clusters of atoms as we said before",

a", "97:05", "framework within which if you want to", "97:07", "philosophize or you want to do theology", "97:10", "or you want to you want to ask these", "97:12", "deep questions about why we're here you", "97:15", "have to operate within that framework", "97:16", "because it's just an observational", "97:18", "framework yes everything we've said is", "97:20", "stuff we've discovered it's not stuff", "97:23", "that someone made up we we we you know", "97:26", "we understand nuclear physics we can", "97:27", "build nuclear reactors for example so we", "97:30", "understand the physics of

"direct observation that in the earliest", "97:50", "universe there wasn't any because we can", "97:53", "see it and now we see that there is some", "97:55", "and we know how it was made so I think", "97:58", "it's so it's important to be humble when", "98:02", "you're talking about science and you're", "98:03", "not saying this is the way that it is I", "98:06", "mean your own a sense but you know it's", "98:09", "not it's not able to answer ultimate", "98:12", "questions at the moment it's not able to", "98:14", "answer even whether the universe had a", "98:16", "beginning or not we don't

when I gave him this", "98:29", "talk and at the end I said I've got some", "98:31", "questions so if the universe is eternal", "98:34", "and it might be it might not have had a", "98:37", "beginning if it's eternal what place is", "98:40", "there for a creator you know that's", "98:42", "that's a good question Brian I didn't", "98:44", "they didn't have an answer of course", "98:45", "right an eternal creator but yeah but I", "98:48", "think that these it might be eternal and", "98:51", "we might discover that so we don't know", "98:54", "at the moment but we might so I think my", "98:57", "point is that these other human desires", "99:02", "very natural to religions and natural", "99:04", "thing right people you see all across", "99:06", "the world in all different cultures but", "99:08", "I think that in the 21st century it", "99:11", "religion needs to operate within that", "99:14", "framework if it's going if it's going to", "99:16", "operate there are still great

comes when you", "99:28", "when your your theology or your", "99:30", "philosophy forces you to deny some facts", "99:34", "some measurement now these things at", "99:36", "measurements we're not saying it's not", "99:39", "my opinion the universe is 13.8 billion", "99:41", "years old we measured it it's like", "99:43", "having an opinion between the distance", "99:44", "from LA to New York no you can't have an", "99:46", "opinion on that right know what it is", "99:48", "and it's the same you know excited out", "99:51", "that these things", "99:52", "people say the Earth's flat or whatever", "99:54", "there so it isn't and we've measured it", "99:56", "so it's just stop it either said but", "99:58", "that doesn't mean you can't be spiritual", "100:00", "and you can't be really just I would", "100:03", "saying it doesn't mean you can't believe", "100:04", "in God or God's", "100:06", "that's not ruled out by science but some", "100:11", "stuff's ruled out well I love the way", "100:14", "you communicate this because it takes", "100:16", "into consideration human nature and like", "100:18", "I love Dawkins he's fantastic I think", "100:21", "he's very very very valuable but he", "100:24", "likes to call people idiots and the", "100:26", "problem with that is people go fuck you", "100:28", "you're an idiot it like is a natural", "100:31", "inclination when you insult people to", "100:34", "argue back and to sort of dig their", "100:37", "heels in yeah and you don't do that and", "100:40", "I think that's very important and I", "100:42", "think that a guy like doc has just gets", "100:44", "frustrated from all these years of", "100:46", "debates with people who educated are", "100:48", "saying ridiculous things and he's a bit", "100:49", "of a curmudgeon you know and he seems to", "100:51", "be softening as he's getting older well", "100:53", "he's the evolutionary biology yes and", "100:54", "that's the the front line in some sense", "100:57", "isn't it yes yeah I mean the thing about", "100:58", "particle physics is that you don't get a", "101:00", "lot of shit because people don't", "101:02", "understand what you're talking about", "101:05", "right there so I understand his", "101:08", "frustration oh I do too", "101:10", "having said that you know I've kind of", "101:13", "softened a bit over the years actually", "101:15", "because now I think at this point both", "101:18", "in the u.s. actually and in Britain and", "101:20", "in some of the countries we are at a", "101:23", "point you've alluded to it where", "101:25", "everybody's angry no a lot of anger and", "101:27", "a lot of it's justified by the way whom", "101:29", "you could talk about that you know", "101:30", "income inequality and all those things", "101:31", "so it's justified anger but it seems to", "101:34", "me that there are people of goodwill who", "101:36", "need to band together to diffuse the", "101:39", "anger in our societies otherwise we", "101:41", "won't have countries like the United", "101:42", "States yes the United States because", "101:44", "it's United and everybody", "101:45", "you've got the United flag there you", "101:48", "know said that there's a sense of", "101:50", "belonging identity and togetherness in a", "101:52", "country which you've got to preserve and", "101:54", "so I've stopped actually um picking I", "101:57", "Isis for example quite enjoy picking", "101:59", "fights with Deepak Chopra on Twitter", "102:02", "it's just for me to laugh", "102:06", "he says some crazy stuff in his hand but", "102:08", "I saw Thomas I've stopped doing it going", "102:10", "well but relative to some of the other", "102:13", "people right he's he's someone who means", "102:18", "well yes I don't agree with virtually", "102:21", "anything he says however he's a", "102:23", "well-meaning person yeah and so I've", "102:25", "started trying to seek common ground now", "102:27", "that's why I for example gave a talk to", "102:31", "the bishops they asked me to come you I", "102:32", "don't agree with them on the framework", "102:35", "their theological framework but they", "102:37", "mean well most of them yeah so I think", "102:40", "seeking consensus and diffusion anger as", "102:42", "you said is it is incumbent all of us", "102:45", "especially people like us you have a", "102:46", "public voice we need to defuse some of", "102:49", "this anger because otherwise it will", "102:50", "consume everyone yes I've tried very", "102:53", "hard to evolve in that respect and just", "102:57", "get better at communicating ideas and", "102:59", "get better at understanding how people", "103:00", "receive those ideas and I think that's", "103:02", "it's there's it's easy to get lazy and", "103:06", "to insult and especially me I mean I'm a", "103:12", "comedian what I do people yeah for humor", "103:18", "I want to entertain people that's the", "103:20", "whole idea behind it but I think in", "103:22", "terms of like discussing ideas", "103:23", "especially that are so personal to", "103:25", "people like religion I've I've", "103:28", "reexamined the way I interpret these",

it on the thing call the", "103:41", "wreath lectures the babies that the BBC", "103:45", "have done since 1952 I think he was and", "103:47", "Robert Oppenheimer did them in 53 and it", "103:51",

Manhattan", "104:32", "projects so they thought he was gonna", "104:33", "talk about the atom bomb meaning is that", "104:35", "he was she ran it basically but he", "104:37", "didn't he talked about how its thinking", "104:40", "like a scientist which means thinking in", "104:43", "the way that nature forces you to think", "104:45", "can be valuable in other areas and it's", "104:48", "a that's an insight in itself the great", "104:50", "thing the unique thing about science is", "104:53", "nature forces you to think like that you", "104:56", "can't have an opinion can I have an", "104:57", "opinion about gravity just be gentle as", "105:00", "a building you can hit the ground that's", "105:02", "it doesn't matter what your opinion is", "105:03", "and and he said so if you think about",

hold", "105:25", "both ideas in your head at the same time", "105:27", "you know there's a get a complete", "105:28", "picture of the objects they're a", "105:31", "description of an electron and he said", "105:33", "that's the valuable thing about quantum", "105:35", "mechanics you know unless you're doing", "105:37", "electronics or inventing lasers you", "105:39", "don't need to know this stuff but if you", "105:41", "want to learn how to think you it's", "105:43", "valuable to be forced to hold different", "105:46", "ideas in your head at the same time mmm", "105:48", "it's really teaching you not to be an", "105:49", "absolutist straight teaching you the", "105:51", "example he uses is because he was I", "105:54", "think he was had problems with McCarthy", "105:56", "and all those things didn't he so you", "105:57", "think he's writing in the 50s so he said", "105:59", "you can either be you could be a", "106:01", "communist which in his definition would", "106:03", "be that you think the needs of the many", "106:06", "outweigh the needs of the few right so", "106:07", "so societies all that matters", "106:09", "oh it could be a libertarian all right", "106:11", "on the far conservative end where you", "106:13", "think that the individual is the only", "106:15", "thing that matters and that's it but", "106:17", "actually of course to have a function in", "106:19", "society you need a mixture of the two", "106:21", "and we can wait it one way or the other", "106:23", "but you need to hold both ideas in your", "106:26", "head at the same time and that's he said", "106:28", "that one of the most valuable things", "106:30", "about science because it forces you into", "106:32", "modes", "106:32", "thought they're valuable and that's what", "106:35",

they're", "107:06", "coming to those conclusions or where", "107:08", "they're coming from yeah and I think", "107:10", "it's so it's so important to not be", "107:13", "married to ideas I got a conversation", "107:15", "with someone about this and they said", "107:18", "like sometimes you change your opinions", "107:19", "a lot I go yeah I do flip-flopping I'm", "107:25", "not a politician like I'm not", "107:27", "flip-flopping I'm thinking yeah I'm not", "107:29", "sure I'm not sure like I I will have one", "107:32", "opinion on a thing whether it's a", "107:34", "controversial thing like universal basic", "107:36", "income I'll change my mind a hundred", "107:38", "percent in two weeks", "107:39", "yeah now I think it's probably a good", "107:41", "idea yeah and then I'll go back and", "107:43", "forth no no no no no people need but", "107:45", "it's as cruel as it seems they need", "107:47", "motivation they need and I don't know I", "107:49", "bounce around with these things yeah but", "107:51", "I've tried really hard as I've gotten", "107:54", "older to have less absolute opinions", "107:56", "yeah yeah Richard Fineman another great", "107:59", "physicist wrote a similar essay a", "108:01", "similar time to Oppenheimer and he also", "108:03", "works in the Manhattan Project it's", "108:05", "called the value of science and I think", "108:07", "that was 1955 and they both shared", "108:09", "actually a surprise I think that they", "108:13", "were still alive because they thought", "108:14", "that the power they'd given to the", "108:16", "politicians the

we're still here but in in in", "108:26", "that essay he said the the most valuable", "108:31", "thing about science is the realization", "108:33", "that we don't know and he said he said", "108:36",

uncertain and", "108:55", "we can change our minds and he said that", "108:57", "that's that it's a great last line I", "109:00", "come exactly what he says but he said", "109:01", "it's something like is our duty as", "109:03", "scientists to communicate the value of", "109:05", "uncertainty and the value of freedom of", "109:07", "thoughts to all future generations", "109:08", "that's the point that's what freedom of", "109:11", "thought means freedom of thought means", "109:13", "the freedom to change your mind in fact", "109:16", "said that's what democracy is if you", "109:17",

"109:26", "years we'll change the president or", "109:28", "every eight years we'll change the", "109:29", "president why because the president", "109:31", "doesn't know how to do it so that",

right", "109:41", "and he's right that that is the open", "109:42", "door that's that that's the road to", "109:45", "progress he's certainly better than", "109:46", "humility yeah one of the things that I", "109:48", "love so much about Bertrand Russell and", "109:50", "about Fineman was how human they were", "109:52", "they were very human I mean finally like", "109:55", "to play the bongos and who's chasing", "109:57", "girls and Bertrand Russell was addicted", "109:59", "to tobacco he would talk about how he", "110:01", "wouldn't fly unless he could smoke like", "110:04", "he had to get us was back when they had", "110:06", "smoking sections on airplanes and he had", "110:09", "his pipe and he just refused to fly", "110:11", "without tobacco and he couldn't imagine", "110:12", "being

"110:22", "are faithful that found existence joyous", "110:26", "yeah wanted to know they just wanted to", "110:28", "know stuff yeah didn't want to know", "110:29", "everything because you can't know", "110:31", "everything right yeah I suppose that's", "110:33", "what if you think about what the job of", "110:36", "the scientist is is to is to stand on", "110:38", "the edge of the known because you're a", "110:41", "research scientist so if there's nothing", "110:42", "to know then you've got no job so you", "110:45", "have to be naturally comfortable with", "110:47", "not knowing and if there's one thing I", "110:50", "really do think we was how do we begin", "110:53", "to patch our countries back up again one", "110:56", "of the reasons I think in education is", "110:58", "to

yeah new movie the weird one", "111:38", "the alien movie he wrote that as well", "111:39", "right yes a great soundtrack yeah yeah", "111:45", "did you are you scared of artificial", "111:48", "life artificial intelligence and you", "111:51", "know I might scare the shit out of me", "111:53", "yeah when he talked about it like he", "111:55", "talks about it like were in the opening", "111:58", "scene of a science fiction movie where", "112:01", "he's trying to warn people and then they", "112:03", "don't listen to the genius and it goes", "112:05", "south so depends I chaired a debate on", "112:09", "this for the role sites in London a few", "112:12", "weeks ago and the so it's treating now", "112:16", "at the moment what people seem to be", "112:18", "frightened of a general a is no I AG I", "112:20", "they call artificial general", "112:21", "intelligence which is like what we", "112:23", "talked about earlier a human-like", "112:25", "capability thing yes and we miles away", "112:29", "from that we don't have to do it we", "112:31", "haven't got them and we're miles away so", "112:33", "at the moment artificial intelligence is", "112:35", "expert systems and very focused systems", "112:38", "that do particular things you can be", "112:40", "scared of them in a limited economic", "112:43", "sense because they're going to displace", "112:45", "people's jobs and actually interestingly", "112:47", "in this panel discussion we had it's", "112:49", "going to be like why you Mike on", "112:50", "middle-class jobs in the UK so", "112:52", "white-collar jobs it's not actually why", "112:54", "people are interested in universal basic", "112:56", "income to sort of replace money that's", "112:58", "kind of lost because there will be no", "113:00", "jobs for all these people otherwise we", "113:01", "have just a mass catastrophe yeah", "113:03", "they're very good someone said that", "113:05", "these systems are special intelligence", "113:07", "systems at the moment they're very good", "113:09", "at doing things like lot lawyers work so", "113:11", "they're very good at reading contracts", "113:12", "and things", "113:13", "that's interesting it's a revolution", "113:15", "it's not like the Industrial Revolution", "113:16", "where it's manual labor that gets hit", "113:19", "necessarily this is kind of interesting", "113:21", "because it hits that kind of", "113:23", "intermediate level that usually escapes", "113:26", "so you're right one of the answers is to", "113:28", "tax there was an example was a robot", "113:31", "tank so in a car factory you say to the", "113:34", "manufacturer well okay you can have a", "113:35", "robot well you pay the robot the same as", "113:37", "you pay a person and then that money", "113:39", "goes into funding universal basic income", "113:41", "or something like that", "113:42", "mhm so I think there's got to be an", "113:43", "economic change because these systems", "113:45", "will be there but all the experts I", "113:49", "suppose who agreed the the idea of a", "113:52", "Terminator style general intelligence", "113:54", "taken over the world is miles away and", "113:58", "so whilst we might start thinking about", "114:01", "the regulation it's not going to happen", "114:04", "soon is the general point I think so I", "114:08", "would disagree with him on that I think", "114:11", "I think it's too far in the future at", "114:13", "the moment I thought it might be one of", "114:15", "those people that's okay it's gonna be", "114:17", "all right right and then then you know", "114:18", "my iphone takes me out on the way so a", "114:24", "choice at the moment isn't it I mean", "114:25", "don't don't give your iPhone a laser", "114:28", "that doesn't matter if it goes crazy and", "114:31", "tries to take over the world I know I", "114:32", "know that's a bit facetious because they", "114:34", "can he would say they could take over", "114:36", "power grids and all that kind of stuff", "114:37", "yeah well it's these concepts that are", "114:40", "really hard to visualize like sir Kurt's", "114:43", "Wiles idea of the exponential increase", "114:46", "of technology leading to us to a point", "114:49", "in the near future where you're gonna be", "114:51", "able to download your consciousness into", "114:52", "a computer you talk to computer expert", "114:54", "still like there's no way we're miles", "114:55", "away from that yeah on you're a", "114:56", "scientist yeah scientist one brain cell", "115:02", "probably we can but Kurzweil is", "115:04", "convinced that what's gonna happen is", "115:06", "that as technology increases it can", "115:08", "increases in this wildly exponential way", "115:11", "where we really can't visualize it we", "115:14", "can't even imagine how much advancement", "115:17", "will take place over 50 years but in", "115:19", "those 50 years something's going to", "115:21", "happen that radically changes our idea", "115:23", "of what's possible and I think Elon", "115:25", "shares this idea as well that", "115:27", "gonna sneak up on us so quickly that", "115:29", "when it does go alive it'll be too late", "115:30", "yeah I mean it's worth putting the the", "115:33", "the framework in place", "115:34", "I think the regulatory framework even as", "115:37", "you said for the more realistic problem", "115:39", "which is people's jobs are going to get", "115:40", "displaced yes", "115:41", "and there's a great I was at a thing and", "115:44", "some someone said I come he was but they", "115:46", "said that the jury was a politician the", "115:48", "the job of the innovation system is to", "115:50", "create jobs faster than it destroys them", "115:53", "so you've always got to remember that as", "115:54", "a government and as regulators if you're", "115:57", "going to allow technologies into the", "115:59", "marketplace that destroy people's jobs", "116:01", "it is your responsibility to find a way", "116:04", "of replacing those jobs or compensating", "116:07", "those people as you said otherwise you", "116:09", "get breakdown so human being those that", "116:12", "people need some meaning like they just", "116:15", "giving them income I think is just gonna", "116:18", "mean just my speculation but it's gonna", "116:21", "create mass despair even if you provide", "116:24", "them you provide them with food and", "116:25", "shelter they need people need things to", "116:28", "do so it's there's going to be some sort", "116:31", "of a demand to find meaning for people", "116:34", "give them occupations give them", "116:36", "something some tasks let's say it seems", "116:39", "to be one of the critical parts of being", "116:42", "a person so we need things to do that we", "116:45", "find meaning in you know like you were", "116:47", "talking about we're the only things that", "116:49", "we know of that have meaning that find", "116:52", "meaning and share meaning and believe in", "116:54", "that we're gonna need something like", "116:57", "that if universal basic income comes", "116:59", "along I don't think it's going to be", "117:00", "enough to just feed people and house", "117:02", "them yeah they couldn't want something", "117:04", "to do if you know a person is a you're", "117:07", "doing something for an occupation and", "117:09", "this is your identity and then all", "117:11", "sudden that occupation becomes", "117:12", "irrelevant because computer does it", "117:13", "faster cheaper quicker these people are", "117:17", "gonna have this incredible feeling of", "117:19", "despair and just not being valuable yeah", "117:22", "I mean oh what wonder utopian so their", "117:25", "version of this is that everybody gets", "117:27", "to do what we're doing now Rush's make a", "117:29", "living so thinking and creating and now", "117:32", "that kind of you know so that that's the", "117:34", "the utopian ideal is you don't need to", "117:36", "do the stuff the job that you don't", "117:38", "really want to do in the factory", "117:41", "you can do the thing that humans are", "117:43", "best at that but I agree it's that's a", "117:46", "very utopian view yeah does everybody", "117:49", "want to do that or does everybody have", "117:51", "their mindset well because we're", "117:53", "education if everybody had an interest", "117:55", "like that if everybody went on to make", "117:57", "pottery and painting and doing all these", "118:00", "different things they've always really", "118:01", "wanted to do and their needs are met by", "118:04", "you know the universal basic income", "118:06", "money they receive every month but boy", "118:09", "there's a lot of people I don't think", "118:10", "have those desires or needs and to sort", "118:13", "of force them onto them at age 55 or", "118:16", "whatever it's gonna be yeah seems to be", "118:18", "very very difficult yeah yeah I agree", "118:22", "yeah it's a big challenge but I think", "118:25", "that in concept at least it's inevitable", "118:28", "that we do have some sort of an", "118:30", "artificial intelligence that resembles", "118:32", "us or that resembles something like ex", "118:35", "machina if people choose to create that", "118:39", "I mean choose to create it in our own", "118:41", "image but that's very godlike isn't it", "118:44", "God created us in his own image yeah and", "118:46", "again yeah see I don't know that when I", "118:51", "talk to people in the field as you", "118:54", "probably have most of them say don't", "118:56", "have to do it yes it's really right it's", "118:59", "gonna be miles away so maybe I'm hiding", "119:01", "my head in the sand a bit but I don't", "119:04", "think so I think it's I think we'll know", "119:08", "it when I don't think anyone's gonna do", "119:09", "it accidentally right so I I don't think", "119:12", "it's just suddenly going to be upon us I", "119:14", "I think we will see we'll see ourselves", "119:18", "getting acquiring that capability we'll", "119:21", "see ourselves getting close we'll see", "119:22", "their systems beginning to emerge in", "119:25", "them we'll think about it just think 200", "119:28", "years ago if you wanted a photograph of", "119:30", "something you want to picture something", "119:31", "you had a draw it I mean there was no", "119:35", "photography 200 years ago yeah I mean", "119:38", "just think of that it's almost", "119:40", "inconceivable no automobiles no", "119:43", "photography what was automobile about", "119:45", "maybe there was some sort of machines", "119:47", "that drove people around right something", "119:49", "close there wasn't three is earlier than", "119:52", "that", "119:52", "right you go back 500 years you have", "119:55", "almost nothing yeah it's crazy how we've", "119:57", "been quick it's so fast", "119:59", "it's so fast I mean and then this what", "120:02", "we're doing right now that there's", "120:03", "people right now in their car that are", "120:05", "streaming this so they're in their car", "120:07", "and they're listening as they're driving", "120:08", "on the road maybe they have a Tesla", "120:10", "maybe they have an electric car they're", "120:12", "driving down the road streaming to", "120:14", "people talking where it's ones and zeros", "120:17", "that are broken down and there's some", "120:19", "audible form and you can listen to it in", "120:21", "your car that is bananas yeah I agree", "120:26", "we've been quick so quick well think of", "120:28", "the world you know the internet I mean", "120:30", "it's a it said not long I mean I", "120:33", "remember it being invented yeah you know", "120:35", "oh well certainly the web went on so the", "120:39", "web well it was very early for me", "120:41", "because I was in doing particle physics", "120:43", "and of course that the web comes from", "120:45", "CERN the WWE bit right so it's certainly", "120:48", "in the early 90s I was involved in that", "120:51", "you know in the university environment", "120:54", "with email and all that kind of stuff", "120:56", "so I don't know when it kind of didn't", "120:59", "really you could you could have a web", "121:01", "browser that just the only sites they", "121:03", "were there in NASA and I think NASA had", "121:06", "one of the early sites and CERN it was", "121:08", "very little oh when did you become", "121:09", "involved with CERN so that would be I", "121:12", "started doing particle physics in 95 and", "121:16", "when was when did the Large Hadron", "121:18", "Collider go alive that was an I remember", "121:22", "2000 and 2007 I think he pause of 2008", "121:28", "is so long ago about 10 years ago but he", "121:31", "started that we stayed up and then we", "121:32", "had a problem with it and then it took a", "121:34", "bit a while to fix it hasn't been taking", "121:37", "data that long but it's a tremendously", "121:40", "successful thing now and its operating", "121:43", "beyond its design capabilities it's", "121:45", "quite incredible it's so stunning a", "121:47", "physical thing that this how large is it", "121:50", "how long is in its 27 kilometres so I", "121:53", "sat about 60 miles 16 miles and it's a", "121:56", "circular yeah sort of a building yeah", "121:58", "well I say it's a big cube I mean you", "122:00", "think basically is mainly under France", "122:02", "and partly under Switzerland and it", "122:04", "accelerates protons", "122:06", "around in a circle both ways they won't", "122:08", "one beam goes well my one goes the other", "122:10", "way and they go around 11,000 times a", "122:12", "second because that's so very close to", "122:15", "speed of light 99.999999% the speed of", "122:18", "light and then we cross the beams and", "122:20", "collide the particles and in those", "122:22", "collisions you're recreating the", "122:24", "conditions that were present less than a", "122:26", "billionth of a second after the Big Bang", "122:28", "so we know that physics so going back we", "122:32", "said about the carbon and the oxygen we", "122:34", "can trace that story back way beyond the", "122:36", "time when they were protons and neutrons", "122:38", "so when there were quarks and gluons", "122:40", "around and and go all the way back and", "122:43", "the Higgs boson doing its thing back", "122:45", "then and we so we can see all that", "122:48", "physics in the lab so that's why we have", "122:51", "some a lot of confidence in that story", "122:53", "it's so fascinating that they were able", "122:56", "to talk someone into funding that that", "122:59", "they got a bunch of people together and", "123:01", "that you you were able to explain to you", "123:05", "know politicians and and you know", "123:08", "regular people what what you're trying", "123:11", "to do it's a great example of how you", "123:14", "get something done so it was the night", "123:15", "the fifties when certain was established", "123:18", "I think was 53 or 54 can't quite", "123:21", "remember it something like that and then", "123:23", "it was built out from the Second World", "123:25", "War so you have Europe at the end of the", "123:27", "war and it was realized that the only", "123:30", "way forward for you it was collaboration", "123:31", "to rebuild the scientific base and in it", "123:36", "for peace for peaceful purposes and so", "123:38", "CERN was set up as an international", "123:40", "collaboration in Europe initially with", "123:42", "that political ideal that it was it was", "123:45", "explore nature just for the freely and", "123:51", "for peace for peaceful means and", "123:54", "peaceful

"129:44", "yeah almost incomprehensible yeah yeah I", "129:46", "don't know the number of it but", "129:48", "something crazy yeah yeah now one once", "129:51", "these you got something here does 40", "129:55", "billion oh my god a cubic centimeter", "129:58", "would weigh 40 billion tons oh yeah the", "130:09", "densest matter created in the Big Bang", "130:10", "machine what are they doing right now", "130:13", "it's a closed for engineering and", "130:16", "upgrades upgrades yeah I mean one thing", "130:19", "we're trying to do is one of the things", "130:20", "in particle physics is that you want as", "130:22", "many collisions per second as you can", "130:25", "generate and then they we have a", "130:28", "collision whether what's got a bunch", "130:30", "crossing LHC we can bury it but it's", "130:33", "something like 25 nanoseconds different", "130:35", "they don't want so it's really we get a", "130:37", "lot of collisions per second and and the", "130:39", "more collisions

if this one that was in Texas", "130:58", "had gotten built and it was more", "130:59", "powerful", "131:00", "then the LHC you'd have even more", "131:02", "opportunity to do something like that", "131:03", "yeah now when these things are created", "131:06", "by these collisions how long do they", "131:09", "last", "131:10", "oh fractions of a second so that the", "131:14", "general rule in physics in particle", "131:16", "physics is that they're the more massive", "131:18", "it is and the more things it can decay", "131:20", "into the faster it will do that so", "131:23", "basically the heavy things decay into", "131:25", "light things and so the only the stable", "131:28", "particles are things like electrons and", "131:31", "some of the quarks and the up quarks and", "131:34", "down quarks are stable things but so", "131:38", "everything tends to decay very fast so", "131:40", "we're talking fraction billionths of a", "131:41", "second fractions and how are they less", "131:44", "than that are they registering its", "131:47", "existence like what is uh what is being", "131:50", "used to measure it so what you see if", "131:52", "you collide what are they I see we", "131:54", "collide protons together then-president", "131:57", "got loads of stuff in them loads of", "131:58", "gluons and the quarks so you get a big", "132:01", "mess first of all so most of it's a load", "132:03", "of particles Asprey and I wish you're", "132:06", "not interested in but sometimes when you", "132:08", "when let's say a couple of the gluons", "132:10", "bangs together and they can make", "132:12", "something interesting like a top quark", "132:14", "or a Higgs particle what's a top quark", "132:17", "it's up quite a very heavy there's six", "132:19", "quarks it says up and down charm and", "132:21", "strange bottom and top from end strange", "132:25", "yeah so it so strange was literally in", "132:27", "there was it the fifties I we discovered", "132:30", "them someone said that's really strange", "132:32", "strange a new kind of particle and so", "132:35", "that yes we have six quarks and they're", "132:37", "in three families so the up and down or", "132:39", "warm family and then the Chairman", "132:42", "stranger another family in the top and", "132:43", "bottom of the third family and so we for", "132:45", "some reason so the only thing the only", "132:47", "particles we need to make up you and me", "132:49", "they're up quarks down quarks and", "132:51", "electrons but for some reason there are", "132:53", "two further copies of those which you're", "132:56", "identically every way except they're", "132:58", "heavier so there's the charm and the", "133:00", "strange quark and if they're in a heavy", "133:01", "electron called a muon and then there's", "133:04", "a the top and the bottom quark and", "133:05", "another heavy electron called the tail", "133:07", "and that's it", "133:09", "so that there's this weird pattern that", "133:11", "we don't understand so we don't seems", "133:13", "like", "133:14", "you only needed the first family to", "133:17", "build a universe right right but for", "133:19", "some reason there are two copies now", "133:22", "heavy ones decay into the lighter ones", "133:24", "is the point so when you make them", "133:25", "they're not around very long and just", "133:28", "answer your question what happens is", "133:29", "that when they decay they throw their", "133:31", "decay products out into our detector so", "133:34", "we take a photograph of the cascade of", "133:37", "particles that comes from these heavier", "133:39", "particles decaying and the trick is to", "133:42", "patch it all up to see to try and so", "133:45", "work out what everything came from Wow", "133:47", "now when they five find these unexpected", "133:50", "particles then what happens then there's", "133:53", "the study of them then there's then", "133:56", "everybody gets together and go okay what", "133:57", "the hell is that", "133:58", "yeah what is that what do we do so we", "134:01", "want to know with a Higgs particle we", "134:03", "know what it does which is it gives mass", "134:04", "to everything so it's fundamentally the", "134:08", "thing that gives mass to all the other", "134:10", "things in the universe at the most", "134:11", "fundamental level so so electrons for", "134:14", "example and the up and down quarks there", "134:17", "get their mass from their interaction", "134:20", "with the Higgs that's why they're", "134:21", "massive that's another reason we exist", "134:23", "you know we go right back we wouldn't", "134:25", "exist if there wasn't mass in the", "134:27", "universe and the Higgs is ultimately", "134:29", "responsible for that mass I keep saying", "134:33", "I keep caveat in it because then you get", "134:35", "other sorts of mass that generated but", "134:38", "but that the fundamental basic seed is", "134:41", "it were it's from its from the Higgs and", "134:43", "so what we want to know is we want to", "134:45", "know how that thing behaves and their", "134:48", "weight so we're study is so you want to", "134:49", "make a lot of them so you can take a lot", "134:52", "of pictures of it and study a lot and", "134:53", "see exactly how it does that and so", "134:55", "that's what we're doing that's what", "134:57", "we're engaged in at the moment we're", "134:58", "making high-precision measurements of", "135:00", "the way that particle behaves so we can", "135:03", "understand the laws of nature and that", "135:06", "daddy's the laws of nature", "135:07", "how are those particles behaving and", "135:09", "what are they doing but it is possible", "135:12", "that some new form of some new form of", "135:17", "particles something else could be", "135:18", "discovered yeah the way we know about", "135:20", "yet because we know almost no that there", "135:24", "are other particles out there in the", "135:25", "universe we almost know a thing called", "135:27", "matter yes so we look how into the", "135:29", "universe and we see that there's a lot", "135:31", "of stuff there that it's interacting", "135:33", "gravitationally but it's not interacting", "135:36", "strongly with the matter out of which we", "135:38", "are made and the stars are made so it's", "135:41", "almost certain that that's some form of", "135:44", "particle that fits beautifully and we", "135:47", "see lots of different observations the", "135:49", "way galaxies rotate and interact and", "135:51", "even that oldest lie in the universe the", "135:53", "so-called cosmic microwave background", "135:54", "radiation we see the signature of that", "135:57", "stuff in that light as well so we think", "135:59", "that there's some of the particle out", "136:01", "there and and to be honest we thought we", "136:04", "would have detected it I think at LHC we", "136:07", "have lots of theories called", "136:08", "supersymmetric theories that make", "136:10", "predictions for all sorts of different", "136:12", "particles that would interact weakly", "136:13", "with normal matter and I yeah I think", "136:17", "it's broadly seen as a surprise that we", "136:20", "haven't seen them at LHC so that just", "136:22", "may well mean that either their vote", "136:26", "they're a bit too massive so we need", "136:28", "more energy to make them and we just", "136:30", "haven't quite got enough well we're not", "136:32", "making enough of them often enough to", "136:33", "see them which is one of the reasons we", "136:35", "upgrade in the LHC so we also look for", "136:38", "them by the way directly so we have", "136:42", "experiments under mountains we bury them", "136:45", "under mountains so the cosmic rays from", "136:46", "space don't interfere with them and", "136:48", "we're looking for the rare occasions", "136:51", "when these dark matter particles bump", "136:52", "into the particles of matter in the", "136:55", "detector so it's so because ya D would", "136:57", "be these rooms full of them I mean the", "136:59", "galaxies swimming with matter as far as", "137:02", "we can tell but it interacts very weakly", "137:04", "with this matter so it doesn't bump into", "137:07", "us very often so we're looking for the", "137:09", "direct detection of it and we're looking", "137:11", "to make those particles LHC so it's", "137:14", "everywhere but it doesn't interact with", "137:16", "us very weakly", "137:17", "and so interacts through gravity and the", "137:20", "the the archetypal particle that's", "137:22", "everywhere that doesn't interact", "137:23", "strongly is a neutrino so we do know", "137:26", "about neutrinos we've detected those and", "137:28", "there there are something like sixty", "137:32", "billion per centimeter squared per", "137:34", "second passing through your head now", "137:36", "from the Sun so they get made in nuclear", "137:39", "reactions in the Sun but they go", "137:41", "straight through", "137:41", "and actually straight through the earth", "137:43", "pretty much", "137:44", "occasionally one of them bumps into", "137:46", "something and we can detect those", "137:48", "because with so many of them going", "137:51", "through but we only detect you know know", "137:53", "one or two a day and the idea is that", "137:56", "dark matter encompasses an enormous", "137:59", "percentage of the universe yes it's five", "138:02", "times as much matter is dark matter than", "138:06", "is normal matter and the number is", "138:09", "twenty five percent of the universe so", "138:11", "it's roughly speaking about five percent", "138:13", "of the universe is normal matter stars", "138:17", "in gas 20 say percent as dark matter yes", "138:20", "oh yeah five Norma about 25 dark matter", "138:23", "in about 70s dark energy that's the", "138:25", "other thing yeah yeah so what the hell's", "138:28", "that don't know know what it does so", "138:32", "again what see we got we talked about", "138:34", "Einstein's theory earlier so Einstein's", "138:37", "theory which works spectacularly well", "138:39", "says that if you put stuff into the", "138:42", "University we said before then it warps", "138:44", "and deforms and stretches and it very", "138:47", "precisely tells you given the stuff that", "138:50", "you put in it how much does it stretch", "138:51", "and how does it stretch and the the", "138:55", "measurement we have is how its", "138:56", "stretching so so we observe the thing we", "138:59", "observe is how the universe is expanding", "139:01", "and how that expansion rate is changing", "139:04", "and how it's a ship how it's changed", "139:06", "over time so we have very precise", "139:08", "measurements of that so then we can use", "139:10", "the theory to tell us what's in it given", "139:12", "that we know what how it's responding to", "139:14", "that stuff and that's how we discover", "139:17", "dark energy so we noticed that the", "139:19", "universe's expansion rate is increasing", "139:22", "so the universe is accelerating in its", "139:24", "expansion which is exactly the opposite", "139:27", "of what we thought noticed in the 1990s", "139:29", "that we discovered that so we can work", "139:32", "out what sort of stuff and how much of", "139:35", "that stuff you need to put in the", "139:36", "universe to make that happen and that's", "139:38", "where we get these numbers from was your", "139:42", "resistance to that when that was first", "139:43", "proposed yeah I remember my one of my", "139:45", "friends at Brian Schmidt got the Nobel", "139:47", "Prize for that and then I remember I", "139:49", "talked to him and he said he was a", "139:52", "postdoc I think at the time so young", "139:55", "and he made he's making measurements of", "139:56", "supernovae the light from supernova", "139:58", "explosions which is so bright that you", "140:00", "can see them you know hundreds and", "140:02", "millions billions of light years away", "140:03", "and he noticed that if you look at the", "140:06", "date so the light is stretched in the", "140:08", "wrong way so we look at the stretch of", "140:11", "light as it travels across the universe", "140:13", "and the universe is expanding it", "140:14", "stretches the lights so it changes the", "140:16", "color and he noticed that

seven billion", "140:28", "years or so it's been speeding up so he", "140:31", "thought these done something wrong", "140:33", "because it you know so so he checks it", "140:36", "and checked in

Prize because he was right it is", "140:50", "stretched Wow", "140:52", "it's a great lesson means that if you if", "140:54", "you're sure that you can't see what", "140:57", "you've done wrong then you publish it", "140:59", "because back to that thing about", "141:00", "humility we saw it earlier you know what", "141:02", "we ultimately we're not trying to be", "141:03", "right we're trying to find out stuff and", "141:06", "so the good scientists will be really", "141:09", "happy if they set out to be wrong", "141:11", "because they've learned something yeah", "141:12", "that's that it's good that yeah that's", "141:14", "that because he got the Nobel Prize now", "141:16", "when he received the Nobel Prize in this", "141:18", "concept started being discussed what was", "141:21", "the initial reaction to it well it's", "141:23", "it's interesting because it's allowed in", "141:27", "Einstein's theory and it was in", "141:28", "Einstein's original theory so it's", "141:31", "called it's got a name it's called the", "141:32", "cosmological constant and that's a it's", "141:35", "it just allowed in the equations and", "141:37", "Einstein actually introduced it", "141:40", "initially so because I signs the", "141:43", "equations strongly suggest that the", "141:46", "universe is expanding or contracting and", "141:48", "not just sat there so even before we'd", "141:51",

the past right", "142:09", "everything must've been closer together", "142:10", "let's say that so the as a man that", "142:15", "chuckles George Lemaitre who was a who", "142:17", "worked independently of Einstein but the", "142:19", "same time in the early 1920s before we", "142:22", "even knew there were other galaxies", "142:23", "beyond the Milky Way and they noticed", "142:25", "that the the equation suggests the", "142:27", "universe might be stretching and so he", "142:30", "wrote to Einstein and said your theory", "142:32", "suggests there was a day without a", "142:34", "yesterday because he thought if", "142:36", "everything's expanding now then he must", "142:38", "have been closer together in the past", "142:39", "and so there might be a time when it was", "142:41", "all together and he was a priest well so", "142:44", "it's a Belgian priest so I think I mean", "142:48", "I wrote about this now it's kind of mind", "142:49", "socialization of it but I think that he", "142:51", "was more predisposed to accept what the", "142:55", "equations were telling him because a", "142:57", "beginning an origin for a priest is", "143:00", "really a nice thing because it tells you", "143:02", "the creation event and Einstein tried to", "143:04", "dodge it and and put this allowed term", "143:08", "into his equation which is the almost", "143:10", "the stretchy term so say well if it's", "143:13", "all if it's all kind of contracting or", "143:16", "something can I put something in to make", "143:17", "it stretch a bit to balance it all out", "143:19", "so it can be eternal so an you can't you", "143:22", "can't make it eternal that way but he so", "143:25", "tried it then he took it out and called", "143:28", "it his biggest blunder taking it out was", "143:31", "ya know you can't put any in his biggest", "143:33", "blunder or at least some people think", "143:36", "what what he'd done was miss the", "143:38", "prediction of the

screaming", "143:50", "to him which is that no the universe", "143:52", "expands or contracts and he missed it", "143:55", "right so I think that's probably what he", "143:57", "meant by biggest blunder but in any case", "143:59", "he took it out and then later in the", "144:01", "1990s it turns out there no it's there", "144:04", "but it's really small it's a tiny tiny", "144:07", "effect but it's still dominating the", "144:11", "universe now and it will and it will", "144:13", "dominate even more in the future so we", "144:15", "think that we're in the universe that", "144:18", "will

"144:56", "constant so it looks like it's basically", "144:58", "one number if you like in Einstein's", "145:01", "equations and just really simple so it", "145:04", "looks like it's something that's maybe a", "145:05", "property of space itself don't know but", "145:09", "it looks like a very simple thing that", "145:11", "doesn't change over time and just stays", "145:14", "there so so it requires theoretical", "145:18", "advance as well and so people are trying", "145:21", "very hard to do that it's so crazy when", "145:24", "you go from Galileo to modern", "145:27", "theoretical

stuff", "145:54", "behaves um right now these are it's very", "145:58", "theoretical right they're trying to wrap", "146:01", "their their minds around what this is", "146:03", "and what the properties of it are do you", "146:05", "envision a time where you can actually", "146:07", "physically measure this and then have a", "146:09", "a real clear understanding of what it is", "146:12",

can", "146:48", "study that so are they linked don't know", "146:51", "and so it could be that we can study it", "146:55", "even though it's a very small weak", "146:58", "effect and it could be web

"148:11", "question I don't know I mean it's a it's", "148:13", "probably tens of thousands tens of", "148:15", "thousands if you can all the people who", "148:17", "work at CERN and the particle physicists", "148:19", "and the theoretical physicists there'd", "148:21", "be tens of thousands because it's it's", "148:24", "so important to for us to get an", "148:27", "understanding of what's going on but yet", "148:30", "so outside of the grasp of most people", "148:34", "including me", "148:35", "like I'm listening to you talk about", "148:37", "this and I'm like thank God it's people", "148:39", "like you think whatever thank the think", "148:41", "quarks there's people like you out there", "148:43", "that are doing this but it it's almost", "148:47", "like you're speaking another language", "148:49", "it's so strange to me was very new stuff", "148:52", "yes you know I mean even when I was at", "148:54", "school and so when I when I was at", "148:57", "university we hadn't discovered the top", "148:59", "quark and we we sorta knew it was there", "149:01", "we thought the Higgs might be there but", "149:04", "we had no idea whether it was you know", "149:06", "so so we're moving in my career we're", "149:09", "moving quite fast and yet you're right", "149:12", "these are the most fundamental questions", "149:14", "about what Weiser eat ultimately why is", "149:17", "the universe the way it is and even", "149:19", "possibly why is there a universe right", "149:21", "movie we're away from that yet but if", "149:24", "we're ever going to answer that it will", "149:26", "be by doing stuff like this and this is", "149:29", "all addressed in this live show that", "149:31", "you're doing this world yeah live show", "149:33", "and certainly be they also the", "149:36", "consequences of the not that comes words", "149:39", "of knowledge but the the cosmology is", "149:41", "terrifying that as we've started with so", "149:46", "I think it as we've said it raises", "149:49", "questions it makes quite vivid questions", "149:52", "that we all have about you know what are", "149:55", "what are we doing here right this sigh", "149:58", "try I think it's got all the way back to", "150:01", "me really been into Cal Sega and he", "150:04", "always used to try this you you try to", "150:06", "link it to things that people think", "150:09", "about naturally then that's why people", "150:11", "are fascinated by this stuff because", "150:14", "they do actually think about it you", "150:15", "might not be with the right names or the", "150:17", "right words or the right facts even but", "150:20", "they're thinking about how did I get", "150:21", "here how did I come to exist what is the", "150:24", "future do we have a future", "150:26", "what was our past yeah these these are", "150:29", "universal questions I think there", "150:31", "certainly are and the way you're doing", "150:33", "this with your live show you were saying", "150:35", "that you have an enormous visual aspect", "150:37", "to it well we have a we we have the", "150:41", "biggest screen we can get in every venue", "150:43", "and it's led it's when the the", "150:44", "state-of-the-art modern LED screen so", "150:46", "they're like Lego then you can build", "150:48", "them so you fill the venue with it so", "150:50", "you know Wembley Arena", "150:52", "then it's 30 meters wide whatever by 8", "150:55", "meters high it's enormous", "150:56", "you must have a huge crew carrying on", "150:58", "yeah 16 or 18 people and", "151:01", "to rock'n'roll show some of the venues", "151:03", "were doing in North America they're in", "151:05", "Canada they're a bit smaller venues but", "151:07", "we just fill it with screen as much as", "151:09", "we can get and then the graphics a lot", "151:11", "of the graphics I I have we're done by a", "151:13", "Dean egg who did ex machina actually", "151:16", "Aunt Estella and the reason I I mean I I", "151:20", "say chose them I drank them up and goes", "151:22", "please please will you do this and they", "151:24", "said how much money have you got and you", "151:26", "know cuz it's way lower than Chris Nolan", "151:28", "yeah they did it they were mean that", "151:30", "they just liked the idea of these", "151:32", "messages and these ideas so they use the", "151:34", "software that they use for interstellar", "151:36", "to create images of black holes Wow and", "151:39", "they they use general relativity they", "151:41", "coded it into their their graphics", "151:44", "software so they can rate race lights", "151:47", "around black holes and you can move the", "151:49", "camera around the black hole and it", "151:51", "traces the way all the light moves", "151:52", "around it so if you remember those", "151:54", "amazing get the gargantuan the black", "151:56", "hole in interstellar that's that's a", "151:58", "simulation it's not an artist's", "152:00", "impression it's a simulation of what", "152:02", "Einstein's theory tells as a black hole", "152:04", "will look like and so I can use that to", "152:06", "talk about what happens when you fall", "152:08", "into a black hole what would you see", "152:10", "watching someone fall in and you can", "152:13", "explain all that using Einstein's theory", "152:15", "you know the idea that it's kind of a", "152:17", "well-known idea it's a bizarre idea that", "152:19", "if I was to fall into a black hole and", "152:22", "you were watching you'd never see me", "152:23", "falling you'd see time slowed down my", "152:26", "time slowed down as you watch me so in", "152:30", "the end I'd just slow down and slow down", "152:31", "and slow down and then I get frozen on", "152:33", "the event horizon and just fade away as", "152:36", "an image a reddening image on the event", "152:38", "horizon so time passes at different", "152:41", "rates as you move close to the black", "152:44", "hole and far away because space and time", "152:46", "have distorted by the mass of the black", "152:49", "hole and so I could I talk about all", "152:51", "that but I talk about all that with this", "152:52", "incredible image which we had it's so", "152:56", "high resolution by the way that they it", "152:58", "was higher resolution than they're used", "153:00", "for interstellar because my screen so", "153:02", "big so so we need a special machine to", "153:05", "play it you can buy the most expensive", "153:07", "Mac Pro in the world and it will not", "153:10", "play this stuff so I loved that from a", "153:13", "geek perspective", "153:14", "you have a special video player to play", "153:17", "the dampers just like a series of CPUs", "153:20", "are attached together and some sort of a", "153:21", "super yeah it's yeah it's one of those", "153:23", "this one's a big sort of visualization", "153:25", "graphics things but but these files are", "153:27", "like you know there are 20 gig video", "153:29", "files Wow because there's so many pixels", "153:31", "might the Pixar resoluteness is really", "153:33", "geeky in it fakes the resolution 6400 by", "153:36", "1536 so impress my screen", "153:39", "it's a lot like that yeah are you coming", "153:45", "to Los Angeles with this yeah wait a", "153:47", "month Taliban Theatre in May the end of", "153:50", "me I'm there yeah I'm here", "153:52", "oh yeah no you've gotta come 24th of May", "153:55", "oh you're in San Diego as well", "153:56", "hey I gotta see one of these yeah it's", "154:00", "gonna be great fun and however much", "154:02", "stuff we can fit into those handsome", "154:05", "devil look at that nice jacket on", "154:07", "looking good someone gave me that to", "154:11", "scrounge that but it's cool cuz you're", "154:13", "looking a cool guy cool guy with space", "154:16", "behind you that's awesome man well", "154:18", "listen thank you so much for doing this", "154:20", "I really appreciate you appreciate", "154:22", "everything you're doing it's awesome", "154:24", "no thank you I always enjoy crying I", "154:26", "loved it last time and people still talk", "154:28", "about it when I was on less time more",

it it's", "154:38", "gonna be very strange now but thank you", "154:39", "again really appreciate it I can't wait", "154:41", "to see your show thank you so much thank", "154:42", "you", "154:45",
