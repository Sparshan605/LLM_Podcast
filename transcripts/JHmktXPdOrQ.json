mean one of the issues", "04:08", "is if you've got an area where you know", "04:11", "one of the problems is you need to have", "04:13", "a reason for the people who live in the", "04:15", "place to

people in", "06:06", "that society to really protect those", "06:08", "animal that's a hard question to answer", "06:10", "and some places are having success with", "06:12", "that strategy and that's

fact the character", "06:20", "who I'm talking to on the show says I", "06:22", "still just hate the idea of an animal", "06:23", "being killed right and I say yes so do i", "06:26", "right we try to dramatize that emotional", "06:28", "you know resistance on the show like", "06:30", "that emotional reaction that we have", "06:31", "yeah I I also don't like the idea of an", "06:34", "animal being

movie", "07:14", "the ghost in the darkness I feel like", "07:15", "it's from the 90s but it's a really good", "07:18", "movie about a true story about this guy", "07:21", "that they brought they

this", "07:30", "railroad this team of lions worked", "07:32", "together and started eating people wow", "07:35", "that's great mowing and yeah we're good", "07:37", "it sounds and they have to they have to", "07:38", "go for the Alliance yeah yeah there is", "07:42", "ghosts in darkness", "07:43", "oh holy have a biting tension that is a", "07:45", "great hunter Val Kilmer is looking good", "07:47", "there those pre fatso looking guy -", "07:55", "handsome that's the problem you had to", "07:56", "just go off the deep end another one", "07:58", "people got really mad about this is this", "08:00", "weirdly the one we got the biggest", "08:01", "reaction to and to the extent that I'm a", "08:05", "little hesitant talking about it because", "08:06", "it always starts to storm every time I", "08:07", "do scenes no actually we've not done a", "08:10", "whole one on vaccines but we really", "08:12", "should because it's coming back I used", "08:13", "to think that vaccines was like kind of", "08:15", "done as a topic and like we've gone", "08:17", "through it is really it is really back", "08:19", "in it as big but no we did one on alpha", "08:22", "males we never said about dating and we", "08:24", "did one on how the idea of the alpha", "08:27", "male doesn't exist in humans like if you", "08:30", "talk to any anthropologist any biologist", "08:33", "any sociologist right and

"08:41", "idea right and we just did something", "08:43", "laying that out in the context of like", "08:45", "people who are oh my type is I like", "08:47", "alphas right well there's no such thing", "08:49", "actually you know", "08:50", "humans are some your dominance some", "08:51", "situations not another's right it's an", "08:53", "overly simplistic way of looking at", "08:55", "human relationships and I thought", "08:56", "there's a pretty simple straightforward", "08:57", "thing I was like it's just a bit of", "08:59", "pseudoscience that you hear people", "09:00", "tossing out and people went ballistic on", "09:02", "the internet because people have sort of", "09:05", "like built a edifice of ideology in", "09:09", "their minds about like there's alphas", "09:11", "there's betas I'm an alpha this is what", "09:13", "an alpha is like this is what a bait is", "09:14", "like you know and let's take away the", "09:17", "words yeah they're clearly men who are", "09:20", "more aggressive and athletic and", "09:22", "dominant and more confident and and then", "09:25", "men who are introverted and shy and more", "09:29", "nervous and anxious and there's a scale", "09:31", "in some in some situations you know live", "09:34", "situations social well yeah but your", "09:38", "social situation could change based on", "09:40", "what situation you're in you know that", "09:41", "in light but a like an athletic", "09:43", "confident male is always going to be an", "09:47", "athletic confident male and an", "09:48", "introverted anxious male who has", "09:52", "problems with social anxiety is going to", "09:55", "be the same that's that that's who that", "09:58", "person I don't think so necessarily but", "10:00", "so when we're talking about alpha alpha", "10:03", "is right in animals what is that it's a", "10:06", "social hierarchy right in let's take", "10:09", "away that word I mean what what people", "10:11", "are using to describe when they're", "10:13", "saying alphas and betas they're saying", "10:15", "like confident strong secure people and", "10:19", "people that are anxious and not so if", "10:22", "you're trying to say hey like it's good", "10:24", "to be confident it's not so great to be", "10:25", "anxious like that's that's fine right", "10:28", "but when people talk about alpha males", "10:29", "and beta males right there specifically", "10:31", "bringing in the language of like", "10:33", "evolution of biology of zoology of", "10:35", "evolutionary psychology you know and", "10:36", "they'll start saying stuff like well", "10:38", "there's alphas and there's betas and", "10:39", "women are hard-wired to be attracted to", "10:42", "the Alpha you know because that's what", "10:44", "it's like in nature like they'll be", "10:45", "using that language that snot scientific", "10:48", "right it's not but it is true that women", "10:50", "are hard-wired to be attracted to", "10:52", "confident athletic men I don't know well", "10:55", "I don't know if I agree with that but", "10:58", "yeah you don't think that women look at", "11:01", "like pro athletes and like big", "11:03", "strong athletic men and you don't think", "11:05", "they're drawn to that for evolutionary", "11:08", "reasons I know I don't actually I think", "11:10", "that do you think that men are drawn to", "11:12", "women with small waists and big hips and", "11:14", "large breasts for evolutionary reasons", "11:16", "you know I think that's an easy I think", "11:20", "what that is is that's an easy intuition", "11:22", "to come to if you're like looking at the", "11:23", "way people behave right but one of the", "11:25", "things about evolutionary psychology is", "11:27", "it's the most common mistake to look at", "11:29", "the way that people do behave and say", "11:32", "the reason what we behave that way is", "11:34", "because evolution says that's the best", "11:35", "way right that's their argument for", "11:37", "instance I'll give an exact that the", "11:38", "argument that was arguments like you", "11:40", "like that word used for instance to", "11:41", "justify slavery right that like oh", "11:43",

"12:02", "think I attract very but that hourglass", "12:05", "shape has been throughout time something", "12:08", "that men are attracted to I think that", "12:10", "hourglass shape is something throughout", "12:12", "our recent cultural memory that we tell", "12:16", "each other that men are attracted to", "12:17", "right that's when that's when we're", "12:19", "that's what we're told from an early age", "12:20", "to this that this is the sort of women", "12:23", "that men are attracted to and so a lot", "12:24", "of men end up adopting that right but I", "12:26", "don't think that deep down that's how", "12:27", "men naturally are you know really yeah I", "12:30", "read that but that doesn't make any", "12:32", "sense to me", "12:33", "that's so non-intuitive because I'm all", "12:36", "about things that are not you think well", "12:38", "where do you think it started where do", "12:40", "you think this this narrative of men", "12:42", "being attracted the woman with large", "12:43", "breasts and a small waist and a big ass", "12:45", "where do you think that started because", "12:47", "this is like evolutionary biology has", "12:49", "pretty much settled on the idea that the", "12:51", "reason why is the large hips would", "12:53", "indicate that the woman be easier to", "12:55", "give birth having large breasts on a", "12:57", "large ass and indicate that she has", "12:59", "she's she's fertile and then she has an", "13:02", "ample fat storage in the right places if", "13:05", "she's going to be pregnant and carry", "13:06", "children there's all these

"well it's more of a thing that we sort", "13:35", "of agree on well we we as the like", "13:39", "there's a there's an idea among the", "13:40", "public that this is true I don't know if", "13:41", "it's a scientific idea that's that's my", "13:44", "you have I've had conversations with", "13:45", "evolutionary biologists who explained", "13:47", "the reason why men are attracted to", "13:49",

"attracted to tall men that are muscular", "14:01", "and confident is because that is what's", "14:03", "always saved you throughout history I", "14:06", "mean totally make sense doesn't it it", "14:09", "well just because it makes the the point", "14:12", "of our show right is that just because", "14:14", "something makes intuitive sense doesn't", "14:16", "mean that it's necessarily true right", "14:17", "don't you think that in this case that", "14:20", "this is a varied argument like I don't", "14:22", "think that's something that you can", "14:24", "dismiss I don't I don't dismiss it but I", "14:27", "don't assume the truth of it simply", "14:29", "because that's what you know everybody", "14:32", "agrees upon right if you ask girls like", "14:34", "what are you into didn't you

I'm you know I'm", "14:46", "really not sure that's the case", "14:48", "really yeah thank you you had like a", "14:50", "survey of women and if the men were", "14:52", "equally kind and equally

gonna I'm not gonna", "15:05", "say that like first of all you're", "15:07", "positing like a value judgment in it", "15:09", "that the bodies are great right so like", "15:11", "our women attracted

that and", "23:36", "then they reach an age where that starts", "23:38", "to become not okay right where it", "23:40", "becomes oh that's not how boys act right", "23:42", "and girls are still doing

weird for boys", "24:09", "to do that you know and we do that we do", "24:11", "it from a young age is very subtle and", "24:14", "very subtle but it's universal I mean in", "24:17", "America it seems to be and you know I", "24:23", "yeah I've even felt that myself like", "24:24", "I've often had an easier time having", "24:26", "close close relationships with women", "24:29", "rather than men yeah

draw a", "25:41", "link between that and you know that men", "25:43", "are sort of like socialized to not have", "25:45", "these close friendships but so that is a", "25:46", "serious problem that men have that men", "25:49", "face right another one we talk about is", "25:52", "stuff like you know drinking and smoking", "25:54", "for instance those are behaviors that", "25:55", "are much more pushed on me you know", "25:57", "those are much more advertised towards", "25:59", "men right and those are dangerous", "26:01", "right those will like hurt you", "26:02", "physically and can lead to an early", "26:03", "death right those are those can lead to", "26:05", "bad health outcomes and so those are", "26:06", "things that men face that are different", "26:09", "than the challenges that

dangerous occupations and", "26:25", "that's and that stuff true is true as", "26:27", "well but like these are the more subtle", "26:29", "ways that you know men are", "26:31", "are hurt by the sort of narrow", "26:34", "expectations of what a man is that we", "26:37", "put on men hey men are like this you", "26:38", "should be like this you know and some of", "26:40", "those things hurt men do you think we", "26:42", "still do that though did ya still put", "26:44", "narrow expectations on what man I", "26:46", "totally I totally do I think we might be", "26:48", "lucky here in LA you know

well but I think that", "27:01", "you know we're we're lucky and that", "27:04", "we're so self actualized you know what I", "27:05", "mean that that maybe we face a little", "27:07", "bit less pressure than then you know", "27:09", "your average Joe across the country yeah", "27:11", "but I don't know of anyone who's putting", "27:14", "pressure on men to not be friendly with", "27:16",

friends for", "27:46", "instance like I think that's something", "27:48", "that's like don't do it they're gonna", "27:49", "bring it up when you argue there's a", "27:54", "level of intimacy that were that were", "27:56", "like and and that sort of intimacy is", "27:58", "what leads to long friendships you know", "28:01", "that really really lasts right it's a", "28:03", "balancing act I think because I think", "28:05", "there's there is intimacy and then", "28:06", "there's also guys who are just being a", "28:08", "bitch things are real ladies be able to", "28:15", "be intimate and to be vulnerable and", "28:17", "explain how you feel but then sometimes", "28:19", "you shouldn't be just fucking", "28:20", "complaining about things you figure your", "28:22", "life out and man the fuck

some", "29:07", "of those aspects being good for you let", "29:09", "me just give one of their example and", "29:10", "I'm blanking on the name of this podcast", "29:12", "I can I can look it up if you want but a", "29:15", "very wonderful podcast about philosophy", "29:17", "but last far as this know I love", "29:20", "philosophize this it's a great one here", "29:21", "I'll look up what it was

about how the idea of", "29:36", "be a man right was just a phrase that he", "29:39", "would hear a lot in the military right", "29:41", "and oh it's called hyphenation is the", "29:44", "name of the podcast and there's an", "29:45", "episode called be a man - really", "29:47", "wonderful podcast about philosophy and", "29:50", "it's talking about that idea of be a man", "29:53", "right what does that mean in in the", "29:54", "military and look I'm just repeating", "29:56", "what's in the pocket I have no military", "29:57", "experience myself I don't want to claim", "29:58", "to but and you

"48:19", "be myself I'm not the character anymore", "48:20", "you still build a little bit of a", "48:22", "character for yourself you know yeah", "48:24", "well also with him it's like that's what",

him go", "50:38", "wider right if he was doing daily he", "50:40", "would have to just talk about what", "50:41", "happened that day you don't have that", "50:42", "much you don't guess what you can't have", "50:45", "as much of a complete thought in 24", "50:48", "hours or in realistically the six hours", "50:50", "you have between when you show up and", "50:51", "when you tape the show right you

"yes", "59:45", "okay well give it to them yeah fuck are", "59:47", "you guys doing testing for that", "59:48", "performance-enhancing drugs man are the", "59:50", "craziest the debate about that we've", "59:52", "never done this on the show because I so", "59:54", "I'm not like you should have fully boned", "59:56", "up I would like to I've thought about in", "59:58", "the past because because the the", "59:59", "divisions it's like the rest of the drug", "60:02", "war right the divisions we make between", "60:03", "the things that are acceptable and not", "60:05", "acceptable are so arbitrary right so the", "60:08", "example I always use is like okay why", "60:10", "don't why don't we like it", "60:12", "performance-enhancing drugs not everyone", "60:13", "has access to them so they're unfair", "60:14", "right they're bad for your health", "60:16", "and we think they're unnatural right", "60:18", "okay so yeah yeah well that's not the", "60:22", "reason why we think they're right but", "60:24", "boats also but there's some drugs you", "60:25", "can take that aren't cheating right like", "60:27", "no good take advantage is the reason why", "60:29", "it's cheating", "60:29", "that's the primary reason so here so let", "60:31", "me give you a counter example for", "60:34", "runners right for endurance athletes", "60:36", "like me I like running I'm a shitty", "60:38", "runner but I like it I think it's a fun", "60:39", "sport so I followed a little bit so", "60:42", "runners endurance you know the big thing", "60:45", "is like how much your how much oxygen", "60:47", "your blood can hold right if you train", "60:49", "at a high altitude then you can increase", "60:51", "that right so there are these runners", "60:52", "the American runners right they live at", "60:54", "a high altitude they live super high up", "60:56", "you know in Colorado or whatever right", "60:58", "and then when they're not there they", "61:01", "train there all year round they buy a", "61:02", "place there and then when they're not", "61:04", "there when they're competing somewhere", "61:05", "else they sleep in a chamber that", "61:07", "simulates low altitude right how is that", "61:11", "not the same thing as taking a", "61:12", "performance-enhancing drug like they", "61:13", "they you know that's not a it's not", "61:16", "illegal to do that right it's unnatural", "61:18", "right it is an unfair advantage because", "61:20", "not everybody can afford one of those", "61:22", "chambers and I'm not gonna say it's bad", "61:23", "for your health", "61:24", "I don't know but it certainly as weird", "61:26", "for your", "61:26", "body has taken a drug I would think", "61:27", "right so why it's not alive because it's", "61:31", "only like living at altitude yes it's", "61:33", "really just simulates low altitude it's", "61:35", "not like taking just you know EPO which", "61:37", "would be the drug that would simulate", "61:38", "that which I've got recent experience", "61:41", "with not personally but because the UFC", "61:43", "just had one of its champions stripped", "61:45", "because of testing positive for EPO and", "61:48", "then we're just finding out now they", "61:50", "don't test for EPO and everybody hmm", "61:52", "that it's very expensive and so they do", "61:54", "it based on the athletes biological", "61:56", "passport and what they think they're", "61:57", "changing variables that you know for", "61:59", "whatever reason it triggers their their", "62:03", "interest yeah they start testing", "62:05", "additionally it's a big deal so it's a", "62:07", "it's a serious drug I mean it's a", "62:09", "serious endurance drug that also has", "62:10", "like some serious health complications", "62:11", "people have died from taking it young", "62:14", "guys in their 20s in yeah cycling have", "62:17", "gotten strokes and died from EPO that's", "62:19", "yet but there's no health negative", "62:22", "effects of sleeping at altitude it's", "62:24", "just couldn't you afford to live there", "62:26", "can you grab route your life no if you", "62:29", "can't yeah it's an advantage for that", "62:31", "person over you so I'm just saying we", "62:32", "have a we have sort of an ARB like yeah", "62:35", "it's sort of an arbitrary we're we're", "62:37", "drawing the lines is not consistent you", "62:39", "know everyone that is a big one that in", "62:41", "terms of the impact on sit is a big one", "62:44", "you're actually saying now that they", "62:46", "think the best best course of

"72:57", "you feel about trans athletes you know", "72:59", "it's a good it's a good question I think", "73:02", "it's we're really gonna go through like", "73:04", "a cultural change on how we think about", "73:07", "that you know it's it's morphing so", "73:09", "quickly you know what I mean I'm very", "73:12", "much because I am of this opinion that", "73:15", "there is no such thing as like perfect", "73:17", "fairness and when we make those", "73:18", "distinctions we're always choosing who", "73:20", "to allow and because I think we should", "73:23", "choose to allow like trans people

like", "73:42", "sports more you know is those", "73:44", "comparisons like you know another thing", "73:47", "that pissed me off so much was like fuck", "73:49", "what's his name the the disabled runner", "73:52", "who then killed his girlfriend's story", "73:56", "that's right and people were saying", "73:58", "about this guy that his that his a", "74:00", "prosthetic gave him an advantage now", "74:02", "first of all there's no fucking way", "74:03", "that's true because he doesn't have", "74:05", "muscles muscles actually thing into does", "74:08", "give you an advantage I mean I think I", "74:10", "think mechanically it does because", "74:11", "they're Springs they essentially the way", "74:14", "his leg works with those things is you", "74:18", "put you've seen him right they don't", "74:19", "even look remotely like feet things yeah", "74:23", "yeah it's a crazy like but dude the butt", "74:27", "hole is that that's not an advantage", "74:29", "because how mechanics work right is that", "74:32", "a spring you put energy into it and you", "74:34", "get a little bit less energy out right", "74:35", "so because that's the laws of", "74:37", "thermodynamics", "74:37", "you can't get more out than you put in", "74:38", "except a muscle does give you more than", "74:41", "you put in because a muscle converts", "74:43", "food into energy for a brief period", "74:44", "right and so he does he has Sprint he", "74:47", "doesn't have Springs sorry he has", "74:48", "Springs he doesn't have a machine in his", "74:51", "leg the way the rest of us do", "74:52", "that creates force out of food well no", "74:55", "question is whether or not the lower", "74:56", "half of his legs which is what he's", "74:58", "missing", "74:59", "could make up for the the advantage the", "75:02", "mechanical advantage of the shape of", "75:03", "those things which applies all sorts of", "75:06", "really unusual leverage when you're", "75:09", "right totally you're not yeah I mean I", "75:11", "don't I don't know if it's I mean I", "75:14", "don't know if you took him with full", "75:15", "legs and took him with those things if", "75:17", "they'd run the same amount of time but", "75:18", "the thing it we can't run fast as fuck", "75:21", "with those things you've seen those guys", "75:22", "well he could right but where's all the", "75:26", "other double amputees who are like you", "75:28", "know coming of a marine track and", "75:30", "field's how many of them are trying to I", "75:31", "mean Paralympics is huge there's like a", "75:33", "ton of Paralympic athletes you know like", "75:35", "I've been told that it has a mechanical", "75:36", "advantage by someone who actually should", "75:38", "know what they're talking about but I", "75:39", "want to like to look it up do those legs", "75:42", "pistorius's legs today I remember", "75:45", "reading stuff at the time from you know", "75:47", "you know exercise whatever athletic", "75:50", "scientists forget what it's called who", "75:52", "said that it who said that it didn't", "75:54", "right yeah but so that's a debate that", "75:56", "we could have right right but with the", "75:58", "point that I was trying to make was", "75:59", "looking at that Olympics god that's a", "76:02", "better event with that guy in it you", "76:03", "know I'm so happy he was in it right", "76:05", "like what if if it does give you an", "76:08", "advantage well so so the point is when", "76:14", "we make the rules of a game right and", "76:16", "this is the point of our episode about", "76:17", "games which is about the Olympics", "76:19", "actually when we make the rules of a", "76:20", "game we are there's no such thing as a", "76:22", "perfectly fair competition that would be", "76:23", "designed by God to be perfect and be", "76:25", "perfectly fair right we're always making", "76:27", "choices about what kind of competition", "76:29", "we want to have and who we want to allow", "76:32", "into it and what sort of outcome we want", "76:34", "to have you know what I mean right", "76:36", "just like in baseball too many home runs", "76:38", "move the mound up or down you know how", "76:39", "they change the rules a little bit", "76:40", "because they want more home runs same", "76:42", "thing with same thing with track and", "76:43", "field we change the rules a little bit", "76:45", "to allow this person or not allow this", "76:46", "person right I think that when we're", "76:48", "talking about people we should always", "76:49", "try to include more people not", "76:51", "we should you know like if and if hey if", "76:53", "you're a double amputee and you can get", "76:54", "your way into the Olympics you can make", "76:56", "a plausible case I think we should try", "76:57", "to entertain that notion and we should", "76:59", "try to find a way to get that guy in", "77:00", "there right as far as trans athletes go", "77:02", "you know we could have we could sit here", "77:04", "and talk for three hours about like all", "77:06", "the different ways that hormones might", "77:08", "affect your body might not affect your", "77:09", "body and I'm not an expert on that and I", "77:10", "don't want to claim to be right but a", "77:13", "sports with trans athletes who are you", "77:18", "know competing with the you know with", "77:20", "their gender right that's that is a", "77:23", "sporting world that I'm more interested", "77:24", "in right and I think we should find a", "77:26", "way to make that happen I know it can be", "77:28", "really complicated complicated and messy", "77:29", "right and there's gonna be a lot debate", "77:32", "about it and it's gonna make it's gonna", "77:33", "be uncomfortable you know there's gonna", "77:35", "a lot of arguments but you know I hope", "77:37", "that that's the world that we move", "77:38", "forward to that's my that's my point of", "77:40", "view my point of view is that there's a", "77:43", "reason there's a distinction there's a", "77:46", "reason why we make the distinction to", "77:48", "have male athletics versus female", "77:50", "athletic s-- the reason is that males",

the ball moves", "110:43", "around you know like like almost if", "110:45", "we're gonna say that if we're gonna say", "110:48", "that men and women have physiological", "110:50", "differences right

its height its", "111:28", "flexibility it's like there's a lot", "111:30", "going on right so that's a rare case", "111:32", "where women's gymnastics we've actually", "111:34", "created events in

agree that men have", "116:01", "run the country in the world for like", "116:03", "most of civilization like almost every", "116:06", "country ok great so men have been the", "116:08", "ones setting

what our show is", "119:03", "about so much is about showing how the", "119:06", "things that we take for granted in our", "119:07", "world like the way the world is so much", "119:09", "of that time is just something that we", "119:11", "built right right and we can question it", "119:13", "and so when we say men are men have", "119:16", "advantages in women over sports I'm like", "119:17", "well hold on a second let's look at how", "119:19", "we set the sports up and is it possible", "119:20", "that we could set up set it up in a", "119:23", "different way right that would allow", "119:24",

based", "119:40", "on hey these are the sports that we", "119:42", "invented we happen to invent sports that", "119:44", "where men have the advantage can we", "119:45", "imagine a world where 90% of sports are", "119:48", "ones where women have an advantage of", "119:49", "would we be having a different", "119:50", "conversation and if that's the case", "119:52", "could we come up with some sports that", "119:54", "like everybody could you know that where", "119:56", "there's no non-physical sports I think", "120:00", "but I think yeah you could come out with", "120:02", "competitions where women and female", "120:05", "traditional female characteristics would", "120:07", "have an advantage for sure you could I", "120:09", "mean it could definitely be done you", "120:11", "know it's just the ones that exist now", "120:13", "ones that involve running and lifting", "120:15", "things and moving fast physically", "120:17", "physiologically males have an advantage", "120:19",

know what it's just not fair so fair", "120:27", "you know but you know I mean is it the", "120:31", "like that's the that's the notion of", "120:34", "fairness we have now you know I think", "120:36", "the interesting thing about the question", "120:38", "trans athletes is it's gonna challenge", "120:39", "that notion it's going to lead to", "120:40", "conversations like this one you know I", "120:41", "think that's really cool and that's what", "120:43", "I think we're sort of we should be down", "120:44", "to have as a society talking about", "120:47", "things especially when there's a", "120:48", "disagreement is the only way to solve", "120:49", "them yeah but you know I think these", "120:52", "conversations oftentimes become the", "120:54", "shouting matches and I you know", "120:56", "everybody digs their heels in as you", "120:57", "were talking about before about happy", "120:59", "identities get really locked into ideas", "121:02", "that they've held strong to whether it's", "121:05", "I did an identities about religion or", "121:08", "identities about politics right I mean", "121:10", "that's why when you were talking about", "121:12", "alphas and betas people like wise a show", "121:14", "getting political this is how dorky", "121:15", "people get yeah there's nothing", "121:17", "political about that yeah but you think", "121:19", "it's political because it represents", "121:21", "these rigid ideology exactly it was it", "121:25", "would be stumbled across something that", "121:27", "was like a really deep those men's", "121:29", "rights activist types then they connect", "121:30", "that to their to their national politics", "121:32", "into their sex gender politics and", "121:34", "everything and and it was just like just", "121:36", "the idea of questioning that really set", "121:39", "them off right but what I'm about is", "121:41", "questioning all these things you know", "121:43", "this conversation that we had this", "121:45", "disagreement to the extent that we were", "121:46", "disagreeing I think is a really good one", "121:48", "to have you know and I'm always testing", "121:51", "what I think I know and trying to sort", "121:54", "of undermine it and say like do I know", "121:55", "this for sure I mean dude on our show we", "121:58", "have done more than one segment we've", "121:59", "another one coming out later this year", "122:00", "where we like go back and we correct our", "122:03", "own mistakes we correct the things that", "122:04", "we've done wrong on our show what was a", "122:05", "big one let's see a really big one that", "122:09", "we have coming out I'll give you a", "122:13", "preview we did one about there was we", "122:19", "did a topic about sugar and fat about", "122:22", "how you know Americans were like", "122:24", "obsessed with cutting fat the low-fat", "122:27", "craze right", "122:29", "and a lot of that was a there was an", "122:34", "early research there was early research", "122:35", "by this one researcher who showed that", "122:37", "sugar caused a lot of heart disease you", "122:40", "know and obesity and stuff like that and", "122:42", "the basically the sugar lobby shut him", "122:45", "down you know and you know were sort of", "122:50", "funding research that really showed that", "122:51", "that was the problem and that research", "122:52", "sort of took over and that really led to", "122:55", "the sort of anti fat craze right right", "122:57", "we did a story on that topic we later", "123:00", "found out that like sort of the way that", "123:02", "we had characterized the story of that", "123:05", "happening was not accurate you know was", "123:08", "or does that make sense like the the", "123:10", "narrative part of it like it's true this", "123:12", "guy's research existed", "123:14", "it's true that the sugar Lobby hated us", "123:16", "you know but the research that showed", "123:17", "that fat is bad you know that fat causes", "123:19", "heart disease as well it wasn't like", "123:21", "totally shitty research and like this", "123:23", "sort of narrative isn't the only reason", "123:24", "that that other research taught a favor", "123:26", "does that make sense and so we talked", "123:30", "about that as a way that like the story", "123:31", "of there was this good guy researcher", "123:33", "who is sort of like stifled by the bad", "123:35", "guy researcher in a lobby sort of", "123:37", "mislead us down that list it's more than", "123:40", "that exactly and that's what happens", "123:42", "when you're doing a show that has you", "123:43", "know six-minute segments right yeah", "123:45", "that's what I was getting on it's like", "123:47", "when we were talking about earlier like", "123:48", "the time constraints on some subjects", "123:51", "like think about how much time we spent", "123:53", "just talking about trans people and", "123:54", "trans athletes yeah our Ally's two sis", "123:57", "males yeah you know talk about something", "123:59", "you have no personal experience in and", "124:01", "that's one of the reasons we've want to", "124:02", "do that topic on the show but we're like", "124:03", "man we really want to do justice to it", "124:05", "and it's really hard to do in six", "124:07", "minutes", "124:07", "so I'm gonna go longer in my in my", "124:10", "career I'm looking to find ways to go", "124:12", "longer well why can't you do it online", "124:13", "like like say if that n-c-double-a", "124:15", "doesn't contract it takes some issues", "124:20", "that you would like to talk about and", "124:22", "like that the the network wouldn't let", "124:24", "you talk about like n-c-double-a", "124:25", "couldn't you do like your own version of", "124:27", "it yeah total I mean I'd have to find a", "124:29", "way to fund it you know definitely not", "124:31", "Adam ruins everything yeah I totally", "124:33", "believe that show I mean so far I've", "124:35", "talked about a year right and I do want", "124:38", "to say by the way we talk about the the", "124:41", "thing that we have a very cool Network", "124:42", "they that was the one time they ever", "124:44", "killed the topic and what they did allow", "124:46", "us to do was in an episode we have", "124:48", "coming out later this year we talked", "124:49", "about on the show the fact that they", "124:50", "killed that topic and we we talked about", "124:52", "how add you know we're on advertising", "124:54", "supported TV and occasionally we tear", "124:57", "into advertisers you know and", "124:59", "occasionally we have to have a", "125:00", "conversation in the network where the", "125:01", "network says actually Gatorade kind of", "125:03", "sponsors the network and you're talking", "125:04", "about Gatorade and then we have to have", "125:06", "a conversation we still to get it did", "125:07", "our Gatorade topic but we had to have a", "125:09", "talker too you know a sugary sports", "125:12", "drinks we talked it okay all of the", "125:14", "sports drinks over emphasized hydration", "125:17", "as a problem you know and so we you know", "125:21", "we did a whole segment examining how", "125:24", "much does advertising affect the show", "125:25", "right", "125:26", "and and as a result of the NCAA we had", "125:28", "to kill that segment and the network let",

themselves", "133:27", "this test is saying can I get you to", "133:29", "click are you upset are you gonna engage", "133:32", "exactly a nice way to get you engaged to", "133:34", "piss you off exactly and if I can get", "133:37", "you to click all they do is they just", "133:38", "reproduce that same stimuli with little", "133:40", "changes just like evolution and by doing", "133:42", "that they're able to control our", "133:43", "behavior in a real fucking way and", "133:44", "people know this you know but it really", "133:46", "is happening to you do you listen in Sam", "133:48",

"134:03", "name is Roger McNamee me nem but it's", "134:09", "episode 152", "134:10", "yeah", "134:11", "it's really fascinating because one of", "134:12", "the things they take into consideration", "134:14", "is that this company Facebook makes", "134:17", "their money off of collecting your data", "134:18", "the best way to collect your data is to", "134:20", "get you to engage the best way to get", "134:22", "you engaged is put things in your", "134:23", "newsfeed they're gonna piss you off yeah", "134:25", "and it's like they're this division", "134:28", "that's that's rising in this country is", "134:30", "coincides yeah social media and it's not", "134:33", "coincidentally and here's the thing they", "134:35", "don't even the really fucked up part is", "134:38", "the people who created these algorithms", "134:40", "that is not their intent they're not", "134:42", "trying to piss you off and they're not", "134:44", "trying to create division all they're", "134:46", "doing is they're like look we just want", "134:47", "people spend as much time on the site as", "134:48", "possible yeah", "134:49", "algorithm watch what they're doing and", "134:51", "give them more like that right and then", "134:52", "it's what's happening accidentally and", "134:54", "so then when we're all looking at", "134:56", "Facebook on like look what Facebook's", "134:57", "doing they're like what are you talking", "134:58", "about right it's just about we don't", "135:00", "need to change anything", "135:01", "you know just we just have an algorithm", "135:03", "yet rewards

causing", "135:30", "these behaviors and then they're saying", "135:31", "oh that's not oh no we're not doing that", "135:33", "we've just like we're just trying to get", "135:36", "people to be on the site more like it's", "135:37", "like connect people you think they don't", "135:40", "change it well what if they had no", "135:41", "algorithm what if they just allowed it", "135:43", "to exist as just a virtual message board", "135:46", "you know Twitter no moderators Twitter", "135:48", "said well that's that's a problem itself", "135:50", "right cuz like that's like okay a", "135:52",

while they were trying to say that", "136:38", "like if you have a YouTube page and your", "136:40", "comments are filled with anti-semitic", "136:42", "hate that you can get in trouble for", "136:44", "that mmm hey you were supposed to clean", "136:45", "up your comments and that people want", "136:47", "what the fuck are you talking about and", "136:49", "YouTube was like oh forget it yes I", "136:51", "think that should be on YouTube right", "136:53", "that's it YouTube YouTube is the one", "136:54", "that allowed that to happen in the", "136:55", "comments youtube's the ones

"jobs in computer programming yeah you", "137:37", "should learn to code yeah well started", "137:39", "mocking people by saying learn to code", "137:41", "and then learn to code apparently", "137:43", "according to Jack Dorsey and vig\u00eda it", "137:46", "got connected to anti-semitic remarks", "137:49", "and hate remarks and I started out this", "137:52", "level of internet this is nonsense it's", "137:55", "fascinating because that doesn't mean", "137:56", "anything learn to code is not offensive", "137:58", "yeah well it's ridiculous to ask a 50", "138:00", "year old man who's a coal miner to learn", "138:02", "to code and doesn't have a formal", "138:03", "education that is ridiculous but I mean", "138:06", "the fact that you get banned for life", "138:07", "from saying that that's actually even", "138:09", "more ridiculous yeah but then there are", "138:11", "cases where people go and they try to", "138:13", "create like a if someone if someone who", "138:17", "look there are anti-semites out there", "138:19", "right they do try to come up with like", "138:22", "way is to indicate anti-semitism to each", "138:24", "other that other people won't detect you",

it's", "138:39", "left out this is the problem right this", "138:44", "is the exact problem that you're talking", "138:45", "about so but the contrary the", "138:48", "contradiction that all of these", "138:49", "platforms have right is the early days", "138:52", "of the internet remember the early days", "138:53", "it was like people were really concerned", "138:57", "that people would start suing websites", "139:00", "because what was on the website right", "139:01", "like like The Pirate Bay the big torrent", "139:04", "site you know like you're gonna get sued", "139:05", "because

you", "144:30", "could figure how to scroll the enemies", "144:31", "off the screen in NES games go left then", "144:33", "right oh they disappear you know you", "144:34", "could figure out how to how to hack the", "144:36", "algorithm that's what the people who", "144:37", "make these videos have done with the", "144:39", "algorithm as well they figure out a", "144:40", "little hole in a way that works and they", "144:42", "figure out oh if we just do this the", "144:43", "video will get shown again and again and", "144:45", "again and here's the thing", "144:47", "70% of all videos watched on YouTube are", "144:49", "being served by the algorithm 70% people", "144:51", "watching a billion hours of YouTube the", "144:53", "day so so people are not choosing what", "144:56", "we're watching the algorithms choosing", "144:57", "and the people that the videos the", "144:59", "algorithm is showing us are the ones", "145:00", "that people are like hacking you know", "145:02", "like these weird fucked up videos it's", "145:05", "algorithm yeah that is really", "145:07", "interesting and it's also interesting", "145:08", "these companies have figured this thing", "145:09", "out like I don't know if you ever get", "145:11", "you see like whenever I post something", "145:14", "there will always be like if I post", "145:16", "something on Instagram there will be", "145:17", "look within the first second or two four", "145:20", "or five of these accounts that like are", "145:23", "you just gonna pretend I don't have a", "145:24", "giant booty and you're like what is this", "145:26", "and you go to it and it's a weird sneaky", "145:29", "sort of computer-generated thing where", "145:33", "it'll say it on with a bunch of", "145:34", "different accounts yup the exact same", "145:36", "thing with emojis and then you go to it", "145:38", "and some ripped off pictures of some", "145:40", "girl with a big ass yeah and then", "145:42", "somehow or another they're trying to get", "145:43", "you yeah they've capitalized on this", "145:46", "comment section right to find people", "145:48", "that have posts that get a lot of", "145:50", "comments you get a lot of views and then", "145:53", "they go right to it", "145:54", "and yeah that's that's how they tap into", "145:56", "it and that's my point of how this works", "145:58", "right so Instagram set up a set up a", "146:00", "comment system these people have figured", "146:01", "out how to hack the comment system to", "146:03", "get their bullshit spam on the top when", "146:04", "I seconds I mean so fast they couldn't", "146:06", "possibly written it yeah like it has to", "146:08", "be a program and that's and that's", "146:10", "instagrams fault for allowing that to", "146:12", "happen at the end of the day you know", "146:14", "what I mean like that's instagrams", "146:15", "problem to solve you know and that's the", "146:17", "problem all these platforms have that's", "146:18", "the problem YouTube has that's a problem", "146:19", "twitter has and so whenever they say oh", "146:21", "no it's just a couple bad apples it's", "146:23", "like you guys through the party you guys", "146:25", "figure out how to fix it you're a shitty", "146:26", "orchard son yeah YouTube's amazing in", "146:32", "that you know you really can be", "146:33", "entertained with things like for someone",

that are not true let's this is", "146:53", "like where they're cracking down on", "146:54", "certain things it's there are videos", "146:56", "it's a library of alexandria man like I", "146:58",

"147:07", "you could go back you could watch it the", "147:08", "first episode of Johnny Carson or", "147:09", "whatever you know what I mean I was like", "147:10", "oh that's so cool right now you don't", "147:12", "need to go to that library you can just", "147:14", "it's literally on YouTube the first", "147:15", "episode of Johnny Carson ever is on you", "147:16", "to who was the guest I don't remember I", "147:19", "don't think I'm exaggerating I have seen", "147:21", "it on the web I saw like his very first", "147:22", "appearance sure it's up there or at", "147:24", "least the early what yeah because maybe", "147:25", "the early ones weren't taped but it was", "147:27", "like super super early he's got like", "147:28", "back hair you know and so like you know", "147:31", "every episode of The Daily Show ever is", "147:34", "on the Internet", "147:35", "you know and so and you know say you", "147:37", "like you know name some of the Senators", "147:40", "I go some of that just go watch you name", "147:42", "an old jazz musician you can what go", "147:43", "watch and play live you know I mean", "147:44", "watch the loneliest monk close-ups of", "147:46", "his hands you know what I mean that's", "147:48", "incredible that's incredible and so like", "147:51", "and I still hope in my heart of hearts", "147:53", "that like that is at the end of the day", "147:55",

in", "148:11", "my heart of hearts that like you know", "148:12", "this is still a positive force for", "148:13", "Humanity I think it's a positive force", "148:15", "but overall the problem that we're", "148:17", "talking about with its problem with", "148:18", "YouTube or the problem with the Facebook", "148:20", "algorithm or any of these things it's", "148:22", "people that suck that's the problem yeah", "148:24", "it's not it's not people that are", "148:25", "putting up videos of Thelonious Monk", "148:27", "it's not ya know someone making", "148:28", "something educational on vitamins or", "148:31", "something like that it's bullshit yeah", "148:33", "the bullshit's the problem the problem", "148:35", "is people exploiting the system and", "148:36", "using that system to

know it's an issue but it's also", "148:48", "it's like part of it is really", "148:50", "interesting to me like part I don't like", "148:51", "the fact it's all this I don't like the", "148:53", "fact there's some ungodly number of kids", "148:56", "that think the fucking world is flat", "148:57", "because they watching YouTube videos no", "148:59", "one who is there while the guy was", "149:01", "making the YouTube video go stop that's", "149:02", "not true yes I'll show you how this is", "149:04", "how you do it there you go there's the", "149:05", "data", "149:06", "okay next keep going stop that's not", "149:08", "true either you don't know fuck you're", "149:09", "talking about of course it works like", "149:11", "that this is why it works like that and", "149:12", "this is what it means did you see our", "149:14", "video on the moon landing no oh this is", "149:15", "one my favorite videos we ever did so", "149:17", "you know it's about how the moon land", "149:19", "the the thesis is the moon landing could", "149:21", "not have been faked it would have been", "149:23", "harder to fake the moon landing then it", "149:25", "would have been to actually go to the", "149:27", "moon because the technology to fake it", "149:30", "did not exist like when we talked to a", "149:33", "forensic film guy right who's like", "149:36", "spends he's got like he's got a fucking", "149:38", "Oscar for you know analyzing old films", "149:41", "right and he", "149:41", "just through it he's like look the", "149:43", "shadows are parallel right they're not", "149:46", "diverging you know a closed light source", "149:48", "the shadows would diverge right so wait", "149:52", "a minute you know that that's like one", "149:53", "of the big arguments for the moon hoax", "149:55", "is that the shadows intersect the", "149:57", "shadows indicate multiple light sources", "149:58", "well that is because when you want the", "150:03", "main argument that's that that is a I", "150:06", "believe that's reflected light okay I'm", "150:08", "getting past my memory of this segment", "150:09", "yeah dude I used to be a full-on moon", "150:11", "hoax or I fully believed we never went", "150:14", "to my shoulda brought this I watched the", "150:15", "documentary that was on Fox TV was on", "150:18", "news radios like 1995 my favorite", "150:24", "sitcoms ever by the way that is a", "150:26", "unacknowledged classic I have watched", "150:29", "the whole series like three times that", "150:31", "show is so I'm sorry just go ahead well", "150:34", "anyway um", "150:35", "back then Fox News actually aired a full", "150:39", "one-hour show called called conspiracy", "150:42", "theory did we land on the moon and it", "150:44", "had me fully convinced yeah there was", "150:46", "all this shit that they showed like the", "150:48", "same background being used in multiple", "150:51", "moon missions that were supposed to be", "150:52", "on completely different parts of the", "150:54", "moon like house as possible they're", "150:56", "supposed to be like nowhere near each", "150:57", "other but they have the same background", "150:58", "and that is it looks like the astronauts", "151:01", "are on wires and it looks like the light", "151:03", "sources or their multiple light sources", "151:05", "and the shadows are intersecting and", "151:08", "yeah you know all the fucking astronauts", "151:11", "when they came back they did this Apollo", "151:13", "11 post flight press conference and", "151:17", "looked like they're completely full of", "151:18", "shit I was all in dude oh yeah", "151:20", "all in and they're all out no I realize", "151:23", "I don't know what the fuck I'm talking", "151:24", "yeah one of the we all need them with", "151:27", "being all in with in with anything but", "151:30", "we also found that they did fake some", "151:32", "things for publicity purposes", "151:34", "photographs that were used that were", "151:37", "photographs from tests that they did", "151:40", "inside a warehouse with all safety", "151:41", "equipment and then they blacked out all", "151:43", "the safety equipment in the background", "151:44", "and pawned those photos off as spacewalk", "151:47", "photos but I think that's overzealous", "151:50", "publicist that doesn't mean no one went", "151:51", "to space I was like making leaps", "151:54", "is about what's the simplest explanation", "151:56", "if you did fake some footage well it's", "151:59", "probably a bunch of simple explanations", "152:01", "but overzealous publicist people wanted", "152:03", "to show people video that they didn't", "152:05", "have video of maybe the the photos", "152:07", "didn't come out so well so they faked", "152:08", "some of them well let me the the thing", "152:11", "about the shadows diverging my memory of", "152:14", "this is we don't talk about that when", "152:15", "people say they see the shadows diverge", "152:16", "right if you actually go outside on a", "152:19", "sunny day when you have a single point", "152:20", "of light like that with light reflecting", "152:22", "you will see two shadows of yourself", "152:23", "going a different there's one dominant", "152:25", "shadow and then there's a there's a", "152:26", "secondary one right yeah but if the shed", "152:29", "if the Sun is actually far away right", "152:30", "for the main shadow you will see the", "152:32", "same shadows be parallel right if you", "152:33", "had a close light source like on a film", "152:34", "on a film set you see the shadows to", "152:36", "verge right so if this film forensic guy", "152:38", "come on and tell us look if you wanted", "152:40", "to get perfectly straight light like", "152:42", "that you would need lasers you would and", "152:44", "you would also but you'd also need", "152:45", "multicolored lasers because at the time", "152:47", "all that existed were red lasers right", "152:49", "they had not existed they not invented", "152:51", "anything other than red lasers right so", "152:53", "NASA would have had to have multi like", "152:56", "multi-decade advanced laser light", "152:59",

"153:10", "another part of it is people forget the", "153:12", "moon broadcast the moon landing", "153:13", "broadcast was something like a six-hour", "153:15", "live broadcast with no cuts you know
