["00:00", "- sup fella how are you good to see you", "00:05", "again man likewise I've been reading", "00:07", "that you are having some great success", "00:10", "with your machine finally it's", "00:11", "everything's up and running last time we", "00:13", "talked you had yet to implement it", "00:15", "actually out in the wild and now you", "00:18", "explain to us what happened you had some", "00:20", "bumps in the beginning right yes yeah so", "00:23", "it's been quite a quite a few years", "00:25", "finally something's happening so we we", "00:30", "launched her first ocean system from San", "00:33", "Francisco in September of last year and", "00:35", "we we took it out and roughly two months", "00:39", "later we figured that first of all it", "00:42", "wasn't catching plastic so what we saw", "00:45", "was that the system was moving at", "00:46", "roughly the same speed as the plastic so", "00:48", "maybe you just take one step back the", "00:50", "idea and how it works so so of course", "00:53", "with this Great Pacific Garbage Patch", "00:55", "between here and Hawaii", "00:56", "twice the size of Texas one hundred", "00:58", "million kilos of plastic doesn't go away", "01:00", "by itself and the idea was to to have", "01:04", "this artificial coastline that is driven", "01:06", "by the forces of the ocean we put it in", "01:09", "there and the plastic naturally", "01:11", "accumulates against it and kind of stays", "01:13", "in there so we can then periodically get", "01:15", "it out because the the big challenge is", "01:18", "that although there's a lot of plastic", "01:19", "it's it's spread out over this vast area", "01:22", "so we first have to concentrate it", "01:24", "before we can take it out because if you", "01:26", "were to simply troll the ocean for", "01:28", "plastic with boats and nets it would", "01:30", "just take forever really so so the idea", "01:34", "was to - to have those artificial", "01:35", "coastlines we deployed the first one and", "01:38", "then what we saw was that somehow the", "01:40", "system was moving at the same speed as", "01:42", "the plastic so you can imagine if you", "01:45", "know this is like your pac-man and this", "01:47", "is your your you know your your catch", "01:49", "and is moving at the same speed it's not", "01:52", "going in and sometimes it did go in but", "01:55", "it went out again we got a video of it", "01:57", "what it was other that's great yeah so", "01:59", "so this is the basic idea but it wasn't", "02:03", "doing that so so and then you know we", "02:06", "thought okay that's that's all right", "02:08", "well learn from it we'll try and adjust", "02:10", "the systems and then literally exactly a", "02:13", "year ago", "02:14", "the system broke into two and so at the", "02:17", "structural failure forcing us to tell", "02:19", "the whole thing back to land and go back", "02:22", "to the drawing board so so we didn't", "02:24", "have the the best start of this year how", "02:26", "much time has been lost or how much time", "02:28", "has been spent I should say in the", "02:30", "beginning phase the initial yeah version", "02:33", "that you launched I was worried about", "02:35", "now so we've been going on at this for", "02:38", "since 2013 also softer yes a busy after", "02:43", "five years launching it and seeing it", "02:45", "break into two that was wasn't the the", "02:48", "best start of the year could could have", "02:49", "imagined but then you know went to the", "02:51", "drawing board and the team really took", "02:55", "it well they and we took those lessons", "02:58", "into account adjusted to design and", "03:00", "relaunch really just a few months later", "03:02", "so in June and this time we made the", "03:05", "system a little bit a bit more modular", "03:06", "so we could try different things to try", "03:08", "and adjust the speed make you go faster", "03:11", "make it go slower and then what we", "03:13", "figured was well the system isn't going", "03:15", "fast enough what if we actually turn the", "03:17", "problem into a solution what if we turn", "03:19", "it around and actually slow it down so", "03:21", "that it goes slower than the plastic and", "03:23", "then what we figured that that actually", "03:26", "works and in October we announced that", "03:29", "we're actually catching plastic and", "03:30", "really just last week the first two", "03:33", "shipping containers flula plastic were", "03:35", "or landed important Wow so it's really", "03:37", "recently up and running yeah you", "03:40", "expected now how long does it take to", "03:42", "accumulate two shipping containers full", "03:43", "so that was roughly month month and a", "03:46", "half and how big of these shipping", "03:48", "containers 20-foot so 42 of these rooms", "03:51", "so the only thing that's really stopping", "03:53", "it from getting more is like the actual", "03:55", "size of the net itself yes so so that's", "03:57", "the next step so now that we went from 0", "04:00", "to 1 we have the basic principle of", "04:03", "catching plastic confirmed we now have", "04:05", "to make it bigger before we can build a", "04:08", "whole fleet of them because you know", "04:09", "we've we reckon we need maybe 50 or 100", "04:11", "of them to really clean up half this", "04:14", "patch of 5 years that's that's the", "04:16", "objective half the whole patch in five", "04:18", "years that's the real objective that's", "04:19", "how is that really possible if you have", "04:22", "enough systems yeah that's incredible", "04:23", "now where you at in terms of like trying", "04:26", "to get", "04:27", "systems made and implemented so so the", "04:31", "so now we just finished this this first", "04:34", "step with the system number one that's", "04:37", "how we called it and the next step is to", "04:39", "develop what we call system 2 which is", "04:41", "indeed going to be a bigger version and", "04:44", "it deers to minimize the amount of", "04:47", "vessel use that you need for it so that", "04:49", "comes because boats are really fucking", "04:52", "expensive yeah the boat that we have", "04:55", "costs roughly 15,000 euros per day to", "04:57", "keep running well it's just one boat so", "05:00", "boat you don't want boats to you know", "05:02", "would you anticipate that it ever gets", "05:04", "to a point where the amount of money", "05:06", "that you can generate from the actual", "05:08", "resource of physical plastic can", "05:10", "actually pay for the expert the whole", "05:12", "experiment I mean hope so that's what we", "05:15", "want to trial next year with by making", "05:19", "products from the catch that we that we", "05:22", "make and the material itself hardly has", "05:25", "any value it's it's really the story to", "05:27", "it and she makes draws don't feel guilty", "05:30", "yeah it's a recycled straw yeah now", "05:36", "without yeah that's a terrible idea", "05:38", "but what would it be a very sustainable", "05:39", "business model just yeah just keeps", "05:41", "going yeah what is the what are the", "05:43", "products that you're thinking about ah", "05:46", "everything with a few ideas we it's", "05:48", "still kind of under development so I", "05:50", "think in September we should be ready to", "05:52", "launch the first one but I think it's", "05:54", "going to be things that that are durable", "05:56", "that don't end up in ways that you", "05:58", "actually that will retain their value so", "06:01", "can last for a very very long time and", "06:04", "that check she wants and ideally carry", "06:07", "around so you can talk about with other", "06:09", "people and actually now's a just last", "06:12", "week we with that first plastic oh sure", "06:14", "we said okay now we welcome our", "06:16", "supporters to actually make well Xuan", "06:19", "called a reservation but kind of make a", "06:21", "make a down payment so that you can be", "06:25", "first in line so if people go to our", "06:27", "website they can actually put in the 50", "06:29", "bucks and get the right for the first", "06:32", "ever products made from the Great", "06:34", "Pacific Garbage Patch so you're just", "06:35", "trying to figure out what products will", "06:37", "have the most sustainability what", "06:39", "products people keep for the", "06:40", "yeah and think that people want dry you", "06:43", "don't want some kind of gimmick that's", "06:45", "just going to be this paperweight", "06:47", "flip-flop seemed like an easy one right", "06:49", "yeah don't they I mean people love to", "06:51", "buy flip flops if they had bought flip", "06:52", "flops especially people that are like", "06:54", "sort of like outdoorsy type folks sure", "06:58", "appreciate the beach and maybe have to", "06:59", "write these things down flip flops", "07:01", "that's pretty easy one", "07:03", "any other ideas um what else Jamie what", "07:06", "else would be a good one", "07:07", "belts people like belts shoes any", "07:10", "flip-flop shoes like definitely some", "07:13", "Yeezys some dope Rhys I get ya some", "07:17", "recycled sneakers like what is foam like", "07:20", "the foam that they make running shoes", "07:21", "out of that's a very specific type of", "07:23", "yeah it's not actual plastic right", "07:25", "something else it's a type of plastic", "07:27", "yeah we might be able to to foam this", "07:30", "mature as well I think we've done tests", "07:32", "with that", "07:32", "oh really turn it into foam yes oh", "07:34", "there's some sort of a process yeah yeah", "07:36", "I mean you could make athletic shoes", "07:37", "that'd be easy right people but they", "07:41", "would you'd have to have a way to make", "07:43", "to like incentivize people to recycle", "07:46", "them it would be so ironic for those", "07:47", "fucking things wound up back in the", "07:48", "ocean you know there's got to be a way", "07:50", "to do that just tell you know like have", "07:52", "like if you have your own company like", "07:56", "drop-off points in cities where when", "07:58", "they're done with their stuff if it's", "08:00", "broken down or it's old they've used it", "08:02", "you could throw it into this bin and", "08:04", "what you will ensure that it gets", "08:06", "converted back into raw materials and", "08:08", "utilized again right yeah sir can I come", "08:10", "in yeah that'd be a great move if you", "08:13", "can people would do that if they if you", "08:14", "made it easy for them you know it sort", "08:16", "of like recycling bins they make it easy", "08:18", "for them they'll throw their bottle in", "08:20", "there sure no so you have these two", "08:24", "cargo ships or these two cargo", "08:26", "containers filled with this plastic", "08:29", "stuff what do you do with it now", "08:32", "yeah so that's going to Europe before", "08:34", "true there isn't really any useful", "08:37", "recycling infrastructure in the US so so", "08:39", "we set up this this infrastructure in", "08:42", "Europe to be able to first sort it and", "08:45", "then shred it and then recycle it and", "08:47", "then make those first products out of", "08:50", "them so hopefully and hopefully with", "08:52", "that then generate the", "08:54", "- needed to to continue running the", "08:57", "cleanup but of course now it's still", "08:58", "small-scale right eventually we should", "09:01", "have those number of shipping containers", "09:03", "every you know every day Rolly so do you", "09:06", "have a your group of people that's", "09:07", "trying to come up with ideas of what to", "09:08", "make out of the plastic yeah it's a", "09:10", "little team in inside they were to clean", "09:12", "up working on that and yeah so they I", "09:15", "think they say that by September they", "09:19", "should be ready to to launch the first", "09:20", "product that's it", "09:21", "that's great man that's the whole idea", "09:24", "behind it's beautiful don't you have a", "09:26", "river system too as well right yes so so", "09:29", "that's the other thing right so on one", "09:32", "hand we need to we need to clean up", "09:33", "what's what's running in the ocean", "09:35", "doesn't go away by itself and yeah", "09:38", "basically the only way to deal with that", "09:41", "is to just go out there and clean it up", "09:44", "but of course then there's this this", "09:46", "other side of the equation which is", "09:48", "there's still huge huge amounts of", "09:51", "plastic flowing into the ocean every day", "09:53", "mostly from countries in Central America", "09:56", "South Southeast Asia where people are", "10:00", "kind of this the stage of development or", "10:03", "countries are at a stage of development", "10:04", "where where the people are wealthy", "10:07", "enough to consume a lot of things that", "10:08", "are wrapped in plastic yet there isn't", "10:10", "any waste infrastructure yet to take", "10:13", "care of it so you literally see people", "10:15", "on on scooters just drive on the to", "10:20", "bridge to dump their municipal waste", "10:22", "into the river because that's simply the", "10:24", "easiest way to get rid of it to your", "10:27", "point you know what's easiest people", "10:28", "will do and so it's not really let", "10:30", "people you know don't care there or that", "10:34", "they are less civilize is something but", "10:37", "it's really the combination there's a", "10:39", "lot of people and there is no", "10:41", "infrastructure that they can make use of", "10:43", "so so then back in 2015 we were like", "10:47", "okay maybe at some point in time this", "10:49", "this Ocean thing will work out who knows", "10:52", "but then we're stuck with this problem", "10:54", "that there's still so much plastic", "10:55", "flowing in that we would just have to", "10:57", "keep going forever and that would just", "11:00", "be no not very motivating and we want to", "11:03", "be this project with the beginning and", "11:05", "an end so so we're like okay so where's", "11:07", "the plastic coming from and", "11:08", "we figured you know probably rivers", "11:10", "rivers are like these these arteries", "11:12", "that carry the trash from from land to", "11:14", "sea because when it rains plastic washes", "11:17", "from Street to creeks to river to ocean", "11:20", "and but then we found out that there is", "11:23", "a hundred thousand rivers in the world", "11:25", "so that's kind of a big amount if you", "11:28", "want to do something about it so so we", "11:31", "started doing measurements in rivers and", "11:33", "then what we found was that just one", "11:35", "percent of rivers are responsible for", "11:37", "80% of the of the pollution so really", "11:41", "just a very tiny amount of rivers if you", "11:44", "were to tackle those could really", "11:47", "address them the majority of of the", "11:49", "plastic going into the ocean and it's", "11:50", "it's mostly like these relatively small", "11:53", "rivers in in capital cities like Manila", "11:57", "like Jakarta like Kuala Lumpur we have", "12:00", "very high density of people near the", "12:03", "coasts that's where most of the leakage", "12:06", "most of the emissions occurs so so since", "12:09", "2015 we've been kind of as a secret side", "12:12", "project been working on seeing what can", "12:15", "work she develops something to to", "12:17", "intercept the plastic in those rivers", "12:19", "and we just launched it a month ago we", "12:21", "call it the Interceptor and it's this", "12:24", "yeah it is a scalable system that that's", "12:29", "almost like plug in place so you bring", "12:31", "it to a river and you install it and it", "12:35", "it just works it's fully autonomous", "12:37", "solar-powered so this is all real the", "12:40", "real plastic that's being pulled out of", "12:41", "this river yeah that's it from your", "12:43", "machine yeah so this is credible this", "12:44", "was the prototype that's amazing this", "12:47", "was in Jakarta for people that are just", "12:49", "listening we're looking at this thing", "12:51", "pull enormous amounts of plastic out of", "12:53", "this river and it's also doing so in in", "12:56", "there they're stacking it into these", "12:57", "bags it's a large physical quantity of", "13:00", "stuff oh yeah and then maybe you can", "13:03", "actually put up the video interceptor", "13:05", "too and in Malaysia so we already have", "13:07", "two of them in in real life as we speak", "13:10", "how does it avoid doing anything with", "13:13", "fish how do you avoid", "13:15", "accidentally oh my god is that real yes", "13:18", "this is this is the clang River in Kuala", "13:21", "Lumpur and it's according to our model", "13:23", "it's like the fifth most polluting river", "13:25", "in the world so 1% of all plastic going", "13:28", "into the world's oceans is coming from", "13:29", "that one river and this is unbelievable", "13:32", "how polluted this is this is crazy", "13:33", "ten million kilos per year roughly so", "13:36", "just just looking at it looks like a", "13:38", "wasteland that's so sad yeah so so then", "13:43", "we so we now at four interceptors two of", "13:46", "them have already been deployed so", "13:48", "here's the one going to to the to this", "13:52", "Klang river and kind of wanted to make", "13:54", "it look like a like a spaceship just so", "13:59", "people would like it and so it has this", "14:00", "barrier that that concentrates the", "14:02", "plastic to the mouth of the interceptor", "14:04", "where you have a conveyor belt but then", "14:05", "scoops it out of the water again fully", "14:08", "solar and battery powered and then", "14:11", "deposits it on to this moving shadow", "14:14", "conveyor which then distributes it", "14:16", "across these big dumpsters can hold", "14:19", "roughly 50 cubic meters of trash and", "14:23", "yeah it just works by itself so it's", "14:26", "that's what it does how much this that's", "14:29", "an insane amount of garbage that you're", "14:30", "pulling out of there you when you look", "14:32", "at it visit visually folks you can watch", "14:34", "the video what is the name of this video", "14:35", "Jamie some people you define rivers", "14:37", "interceptor 0:02 cleaning in Malaysia is", "14:41", "the title of the YouTube video it's", "14:43", "crazy now and you're not catching any", "14:47", "fish in this oh yeah so so because this", "14:50", "this barrier is non-permeable the", "14:52", "current just flows underneath it's", "14:54", "basically that the sea life can just", "14:56", "pass it make sure at one point we had", "14:58", "this giant lizard which was probably 2", "15:01", "meters we should bring post that photo", "15:03", "it was she kind of climbing onto the", "15:05", "barrier and then it just swam around it", "15:08", "so 2 meters really yeah everyone a half", "15:11", "thick it was what kind of lizard is that", "15:13", "I don't don't know the name but it was", "15:17", "some kind of monitor or something", "15:19", "monitored that yeah you're right yeah", "15:21", "yeah do you know where's that you see if", "15:23", "an image of that no do you post it next", "15:27", "week", "15:27", "oh you haven't posted no", "15:29", "okay he was looking for it yeah I", "15:30", "thought you were saying it was out there", "15:31", "so it's safe for fish what about the", "15:35", "stuff that doesn't float on the very", "15:37", "surface right so this isn't goes down", "15:40", "one meter what we measured is that", "15:42", "really almost all the plastic isn't that", "15:45", "top layer so sure you know won't be a", "15:48", "hundred percent efficient but I think", "15:49", "it's it's really about having this", "15:51", "pragmatic thing that catches most of it", "15:53", "and it most importantly leaves wildlife", "15:56", "alone because everything else can just", "15:57", "swim underneath that exactly yeah that's", "15:59", "that's great and so this plan that you", "16:03", "had when you know it's been six years", "16:07", "running how much of your daily time is", "16:11", "devoted to this oh I don't think there's", "16:14", "much much free time at all it's so", "16:18", "special past year I've not had a single", "16:22", "free day so not a single yeah just 9:00", "16:26", "a.m. - usually you know 9:00 p.m. in the", "16:30", "office just it's been busy but I think", "16:35", "it was it was worth it now looking where", "16:38", "we were at beginning of the year to", "16:39", "where we're now well now that you've", "16:40", "actually pulled these cargo containers", "16:43", "filled with plastic out of the ocean", "16:45", "that must give you an extreme feeling of", "16:47", "satisfaction right you've you've", "16:49", "actually made it work like it's moving", "16:52", "now so I was I was kind of hoping for", "16:55", "that feeling but then when you get to", "16:56", "that point you're like okay but they're", "16:58", "still you can really only see the amount", "17:01", "of work that's still ahead of you so so", "17:03", "it's actually really hard to have enjoy", "17:06", "successes in a way I should probably get", "17:11", "better at that it's hard well", "17:12", "particularly what you're doing you have", "17:14", "a monumental task in front of you and", "17:17", "what you're doing is rightly being", "17:19", "applauded by so many people but I don't", "17:21", "know how many people are actually", "17:21", "helping you you you have a crazy thing", "17:24", "that you're doing you're trying to pull", "17:25", "the plastic out of the ocean when people", "17:27", "find out about the Great Pacific Garbage", "17:28", "Patch they they get panicky they're like", "17:31", "what how long has this been going on how", "17:32", "do i how do I not know about this", "17:34", "because so few people I mean I would", "17:36", "think like maybe 40% of the population", "17:38", "understands there's a gigantic patch of", "17:40", "garbage in the middle of the ocean and", "17:41", "it was discovered", "17:42", "20 years ago exactly 20 years ago and", "17:44", "still it's there just been growing Oh", "17:47", "1998 no one had a goddamn clue nope and", "17:50", "then they went we hate what what's going", "17:52", "on here yeah is all this garbage and it", "17:54", "keeps getting bigger and bigger right", "17:55",

"18:06", "others would go further north you", "18:08", "thought well let's try and cut off this", "18:11", "this piece and then he was looking at", "18:13", "the water and he just just saw that all", "18:16", "that trash and then he went back he was", "18:18", "shocked about it and then he decided to", "18:22", "take some measurements publish the", "18:24", "results and that kind of popularized", "18:26", "that whole concept of the Great Pacific", "18:28", "Garbage Patch mmm it's a weird thing to", "18:31", "see when you see drones flying over it", "18:33", "and you see the footage of it and and", "18:35", "it's also it's it's a lot a lot of it is", "18:37", "a lot smaller than people think of it", "18:39", "right because it's broken down by the", "18:41", "ocean right yeah so that's that's what", "18:43", "happens over time is that this these", "18:45", "larger objects how it enters the ocean", "18:48", "due to the working of the ways as well", "18:52", "as the Sun breaks down to these smaller", "18:54", "and smaller pieces which is actually not", "18:56", "really a good thing because these", "18:57", "smaller pieces are then easier to ingest", "19:00", "for for fish and other wildlife so so", "19:04", "the smaller gets in a way that the more", "19:05", "harmful it gets as well and fortunate", "19:09", "what we see is that still 92% of the", "19:12", "plastic is still non micro plastic so", "19:15", "big stuff but of course if we don't", "19:17", "clean it up over the next few decades", "19:19", "all of that big stuff will also become", "19:20", "micro plastics and then in a much worse", "19:23", "day is the cleanup of micros micro", "19:26", "plastics possible or is it just", "19:28", "something that needs to be sort of", "19:29", "rethought out well so that was actually", "19:32", "one of the positive surprises that we", "19:34", "that we had this year is that the clean", "19:36", "of system in the patch wasn't just", "19:38", "catching plastic and not just the big", "19:40", "stuff it was also catching most of the", "19:42", "micro plastics so down to 100 meters", "19:45", "clogged up with all the other stuff is", "19:47", "that what it is we're not exactly sure", "19:49", "how it was able to do that but we just", "19:53", "saw huge amounts of those those micro", "19:55", "plastics and in this", "19:56", "it's probably has to do something with", "19:57", "the radiation of the way so you have", "20:00", "that big pipe that keeps the system", "20:02", "together and because waves are kind of", "20:06", "crashing against it it reflects waves as", "20:08", "well and almost like a lens", "20:10", "it was concentrating those micro", "20:12", "plastics into one patch in the middle of", "20:15", "the system which I was kind of just", "20:17", "holding up into into the system so it", "20:20", "was so that's that was really we weren't", "20:23", "expecting to collect micro plastics but", "20:25", "there we were that's pretty cool so now", "20:28", "where you at in terms of trying to", "20:31", "expand it to a point where you could you", "20:34", "know really get this goal of half of the", "20:37", "plastic or the ocean in five years yeah", "20:39", "so so it would probably be easier if we", "20:42", "had one goal but we now set two goals", "20:44", "for ourselves one is the 50% of", "20:46", "five-year for the for the patch but the", "20:48", "other one is that we want to have", "20:50", "interceptors into the 1,000 most", "20:54", "polluting rivers the ones that do the 80", "20:56", "percent in in the next five years so", "20:59", "will be will be pretty busy really", "21:02", "really busy", "21:03", "yes so if you're not busy enough yeah", "21:05", "how many people are working for your in", "21:08", "your organization now about a hundred", "21:09", "and I think really team is being as now", "21:13", "better than it's ever been so", "21:15", "fortunately there's there's definitely", "21:18", "love help but we're still recruiting not", "21:21", "quite I think not not our twenty thirty", "21:24", "people coming up here so so definitely", "21:28", "there is a lot of work to do and what is", "21:30", "this ride been like for you from being", "21:33", "this like really young guy when you", "21:34", "figure this out like how old were you", "21:35", "when you came up with the idea first", "21:38", "ideas when it was 16 but really founded", "21:40", "the organization when it was 18", "21:41", "yeah so that's really young eighteen to", "21:45", "where you are now just being constantly", "21:47", "involved in this process what does I've", "21:48", "been like for you educational I would", "21:51", "say so really when I started and I'm", "21:55", "gonna look back at when I started I", "21:57", "really didn't have a bloody clue what I", "21:59", "was doing and I suppose that was a good", "22:03", "thing because if I would have known how", "22:04", "complicated and big it would have to", "22:07", "become in order to actually", "22:09", "take some plastic out of the ocean I", "22:11", "probably wouldn't have started it was", "22:14", "just too big and remember doing the", "22:17", "giving my first presentation back in", "22:20", "2012 and somebody approached me and he", "22:23", "said okay great idea it's going to cost", "22:27", "like tens of millions of dollars you're", "22:29", "going to need a team of maybe a hundred", "22:31", "people to to to get this to a point that", "22:34", "it could actually work and I thought", "22:36", "this guy was crazy no way you can so", "22:39", "that's why it has started a two million", "22:41", "dollar crowdfunding campaign to to get", "22:43", "it started and yeah he was closer to the", "22:48", "truth than I could have ever imagined", "22:51", "when you when you think about the amount", "22:53", "of time that you're investing in this", "22:54", "deed how do you see yourself ever", "22:56", "getting off this ride does this what you", "22:58", "want to do for the rest of your life no", "23:00", "so I I do I simply want to solve", "23:05", "problems and I think this is kind of a", "23:08", "good starter problem it's I think it's", "23:11", "very feasible to actually solve it it's", "23:15", "by the way hilarious that you're talking", "23:17", "about the Great Pacific Garbage Patch as", "23:19", "a starter problem Oh what kind of", "23:22", "ambition do you have that's one of the", "23:26", "most perplexing problems with the", "23:29", "garbage and waste today yeah but I do", "23:32", "think it's it's solvable and it's I", "23:34", "think it is - according to you and", "23:37", "though you're saying but to call it a", "23:38", "starter problem Salieri's yeah yeah and", "23:41", "I mean I think this was a exciting thing", "23:44", "for me is that it's I can pick this", "23:46", "promise that's the first one because I", "23:48", "believed it would not just be solvable", "23:50", "it's solvable by a relatively small", "23:53", "group of passionate people and yeah so", "23:57", "of course what I hope is that with the", "24:00", "OSHA clean we can kind of create this", "24:01", "blueprint of how you solve a problem and", "24:03", "how you how you make civilization a bit", "24:08", "more sustainable so that hopefully with", "24:10", "the blueprint we can not only solve more", "24:14", "other problems in the future but also", "24:16", "inspire others to to do the same thing", "24:17", "well that's a beautiful sentiment and do", "24:20", "you have any other things that you want", "24:22", "to try to solve once you", "24:23", "sort of stepped away from this mm-hmm", "24:26", "yeah so I really I just definitely not", "24:31", "going to be a shortage of ideas so I", "24:35", "keep this little booklet so that's kind", "24:38", "of overflowing but what I realize is to", "24:41", "to be successful with the cleanup I", "24:46", "really need razor-sharp focus and I can", "24:49", "only do one thing at the same time and", "24:51", "like IDs are like viruses and when they", "24:55", "enter your mind it kind of expands and", "24:58", "evolves and it's really quite dangerous", "25:01", "actually to have new ideas it was I", "25:03", "forget who said that but somebody", "25:07", "recently I heard saying the best thing", "25:10", "you can do is having one great idea than", "25:12", "never having any other ideas and the", "25:14", "rest of your life so just because you", "25:16", "know to be your resources right yeah to", "25:19", "achieve something you need full focus I", "25:21", "think was Stewart Brand but two good", "25:24", "things it's it's accurate what do you", "25:26", "think though about what I was going to", "25:27", "get at was do you ever conceive of a", "25:30", "possibility of coming up with something", "25:32", "that removes carbon from the atmosphere", "25:33", "that's a giant issue with us right right", "25:36", "carbon emissions so definitely I believe", "25:40", "negative emissions I think you refer to", "25:44", "them will be required to make the goals", "25:49", "to kind of keep the warming in check", "25:54", "it's however it's a much more difficult", "25:57", "problem because if you think of the", "26:00", "ocean it's it's busy a two dimensional", "26:02", "problem it's a plastic on the surface", "26:05", "and fortunately it's not even the whole", "26:07", "ocean it's it's kind of concentrating in", "26:09", "these accumulation zone so the Garbage", "26:11", "Patch although it's twice the size of", "26:13", "Texas it's still one point six million", "26:16", "square kilometers while the ocean is", "26:17", "like three hundred million square", "26:19", "kilometres so it's really just maybe", "26:22", "less than a percent of the ocean which", "26:25", "needs to be cleaned and it's a again", "26:27", "it's a two-dimensional problem well the", "26:29", "atmosphere is three-dimensional so it's", "26:33", "just this is one dimensional increase is", "26:36", "just", "26:37", "yeah it's just a huge challenge so I do", "26:40", "think it needs to be tech oh and it's", "26:43", "definitely exciting problem to think", "26:46", "about I do think that's definitely", "26:49", "that's not a good starter problem to to", "26:52", "work huh", "26:53", "no um wasn't there something Jamie that", "26:56", "we had talked about where they had", "26:57", "figured out a way to make these building", "26:58", "sized essentially vacuum cleaners they", "27:01", "were gonna put in the center of certain", "27:03", "cities I believe it was in Asia maybe", "27:05", "perhaps China they'd come up with this", "27:07", "and the I don't know if they implemented", "27:09", "it yet but the idea was to have these", "27:10", "enormous things that place that look", "27:12", "like a skyscraper and really it was just", "27:14", "a huge vacuum cleaner for carbon sure I", "27:17", "know they're of a few companies that", "27:19", "working with they've carbon engineering", "27:21", "is one there is also there's also one", "27:24", "out of Switzerland forgot the name but", "27:26", "so so definitely good smart people are", "27:30", "working on that problem I'm not sure", "27:33", "where they are in terms of the economics", "27:35", "and sit right here when you mentioned", "27:37", "his carbon engineering is this one okay", "27:39", "so that looks like giant fans like a", "27:43", "huge building filled with fans we", "27:46", "believe humanity can solve climate", "27:47", "change he hikes imagine like we have", "27:50", "filters for air the same way of filters", "27:53", "for water direct air captured technology", "27:55", "carbon engineering more than ten years", "27:59", "in the making that can capture carbon", "28:00", "dioxide directly from the atmosphere and", "28:03", "look at that machine try to get a", "28:04", "close-up on what that thing looks like", "28:06", "it looks like giant fucking washing", "28:08", "machine right like it's washing the air", "28:10", "doesn't it look a giant washing machines", "28:13", "Wow that mean it seems like it's", "28:16", "feasible it doesn't seem like it's", "28:17", "something that's impossible", "28:19", "yeah I think that's the scalability that", "28:21", "that's the main Ryland", "28:23", "well it's also funding like if you drive", "28:25", "over or fly over Manhattan rather and", "28:28", "see the density of the structures and", "28:29", "how many buildings are in there you know", "28:31", "that people can make some pretty insane", "28:32", "shit right why couldn't they make some", "28:34", "giant insane vacuum cleaner for the air", "28:36", "that's you know as big as a city block", "28:38", "of course a lot of it comes down to", "28:40", "economics or our system it's not very", "28:43", "good at valuing things that our", "28:45", "long-term are directly benefit ourselves", "28:48", "so", "28:50", "so definitely people tax it no fun both", "28:54", "find a way to make it profitable is this", "28:55", "another one rendering of what one would", "28:56", "look like to capture 1 million tons of", "28:59", "co2 per year whoa sounds like it looks", "29:02", "like it'd be noisy yo yeah probably", "29:04", "annoying as fuck", "29:05", "look at those fans it's so weird though", "29:08", "like the whole array of fans okay that", "29:11", "seems like a way to do it", "29:12", "looks like somebody built a giant", "29:14", "computer and tried to cool everything", "29:16", "and then know how all this carbon what", "29:18", "the fuck they do with that", "29:19", "burn it what do they do what do you make", "29:22", "shit out of it what do you do make", "29:24", "diamonds imagine that that is her girl's", "29:26", "best friend and making that other carbon", "29:27", "that you pull out of the air", "29:28", "that would be a great business model", "29:30", "this would be like a green diamond right", "29:32", "a diamond that's actually made and it's", "29:34", "all pressured by solar power the use", "29:36", "solar power to fucking smash it a", "29:39", "freight car that's same carbon fiber I", "29:41", "don't know is it the same shit yeah why", "29:43", "not right cause be it's carbon right so", "29:46", "carbon is how they may die it's coal", "29:49", "right which is essentially carbon right", "29:51", "do they make diamonds from carbon or", "29:54", "they make diamonds just from coal what", "29:56", "is cool coals like burnt shit right", "29:58", "there's many many forms in which carbon", "30:02", "exists yeah so I know there's still", "30:05", "structure they are doing that now where", "30:07", "they are making commercially made", "30:09", "diamonds diamonds are made of carbon so", "30:11", "they form as carbon atoms under a high", "30:13", "temperature and pressure they bond", "30:15", "together to start growing crystals", "30:17", "that's why a diamond is such a hard", "30:18", "material because you have each carbon", "30:20", "atom participating in four of these very", "30:24", "strong covalent bonds that form between", "30:27", "carbon atoms", "30:28", "I've never word that read that word out", "30:30", "loud covalent have you ever read that", "30:31", "word out well covalent is that I said", "30:34", "I've never even seen that word so these", "30:37", "bonds that form between carbon atoms so", "30:39", "that I know they're doing it now they're", "30:41", "they're making diamonds with certain", "30:43", "machines high pressure yeah if they did", "30:46", "that would be that would be hilarious", "30:47", "that would be a good thing too because", "30:49", "they would put a dent in the actual", "30:51", "diamond market which is this weird lock", "30:53", "down fucking strange market because", "30:55", "diamonds aren't nearly as valuable as", "30:57", "they're set out to be De Beers takes", "31:00", "these diamonds and they stockpile them", "31:02", "and they only release a certain amount", "31:04", "they keep the price very high but it's", "31:06", "all engineered like the profit like", "31:08", "diamonds used to be far more rare than", "31:10", "they are now but with the innovation in", "31:13", "mining technology and their ability to", "31:16", "get to diamonds they couldn't get to", "31:17", "before they have a lot of diamonds okay", "31:19", "it's not as valuable as it appears when", "31:21", "you go to buy one okay so we can make", "31:25", "carbon diamonds bro I'm actually plastic", "31:28", "again carbon chains others oh yeah we", "31:32", "turn even make diamonds out of ocean but", "31:33", "whoa that would be the ultimate green", "31:36", "diamond imagine like if you like a", "31:38", "really ecologically minded rapper you", "31:42", "wear out all your ice could come from", "31:44", "the ocean let everybody know from trash", "31:46", "to treasure yes they dude that's the", "31:49", "fucking that's that's the signature of", "31:51", "the company in quotes from trash to", "31:53", "treasure write these things down boy in", "31:56", "diamonds how about that I like it yeah", "31:59", "dude you could be the first guy to do", "32:02", "this here we go", "32:03", "a plastic this is an ocean diamond whoa", "32:06", "earth is crushing the ocean into salty", "32:10", "diamonds that's a dope looking diamond", "32:12", "to salt I guess", "32:16", "recreated salty diamond deposits in a", "32:19", "high-pressure high-temperature", "32:19", "experiment suggesting that many of", "32:22", "Earth's diamonds form when the mantle", "32:25", "crushes ancient seabed minerals oh isn't", "32:31", "science and the earth cool I mean if you", "32:35", "do get to do this here's another problem", "32:37", "okay here's a big one for the ocean", "32:39", "we're depleting it of seafood right I", "32:43", "mean we you know I had how do you say", "32:45", "his name again", "32:46", "sequoias right Louie Psihoyos", "32:49", "who directed the cove on yeah we were", "32:51", "talking about the depletion depletion on", "32:55", "the wildlife in the in the ocean and", "32:56", "when you start looking at it on a grand", "32:58", "scale like how much fish they're pulling", "33:00", "out of the oceans it's very sobering you", "33:03", "know sure maybe you can come up with a", "33:04", "way to replenish well fish in the ocean", "33:08", "so we can continue eating sushi yeah so", "33:12", "so maybe could just zoom out a bit and", "33:15", "realize oh what is so because", "33:17", "of course plastic pollution climate", "33:19", "change overfishing I think it's all part", "33:22", "of one big problem to make civilization", "33:25", "sustainable and the way I look at it is", "33:28", "that of course over the past 200 years", "33:31", "humanity has made tremendous progress so", "33:34", "of course since agriculture revolution", "33:37", "10,000 years ago UNT has been kind of", "33:40", "stagnant no progress or just very very", "33:44", "slow progress number of people lifespan", "33:48", "it was all kind of flat nothing really", "33:51", "happened and then since the dawn of the", "33:54", "Industrial Revolution and when we", "33:56", "learned how to utilize science and our", "33:58", "knowledge collective knowledge to to", "34:02", "turn that into progress basically every", "34:06", "possible metric for Humanity has", "34:09", "improved tremendously and if you think", "34:12", "of wealth health violence education", "34:15", "rights all these things and no you", "34:18", "that's Steven Pinker on these is much", "34:20", "more knowledgeable on that topic than I", "34:23", "am yet so it's a truly at this point in", "34:27", "time it has never been a better time to", "34:31", "be alive for humans than been today not", "34:33", "saying that it can't get better but we", "34:36", "have made tremendous progress by one", "34:39", "hand in imagining things that don't", "34:42", "exist yet so inventing technologies and", "34:45", "also inventing institutions and on the", "34:48", "other hand our human ability to", "34:51", "collaborate effectively in large numbers", "34:54", "which includes you know the corporation", "34:56", "which is a very effective way for people", "34:58", "to to work together now all that", "35:01", "progress has always has also had its", "35:05", "negative side effects which are most", "35:07", "pronounced of course in the area of the", "35:08", "environment where we put things into an", "35:12", "environment that shouldn't belong there", "35:14", "and we take too much out of it then", "35:15", "nature can replenish which includes you", "35:18", "know the fish and on the other hand you", "35:20", "have the plastic going into the", "35:21", "environment etc so so and the question", "35:25", "is well how do we solve that and of", "35:27", "course one hand is to say okay it's kind", "35:30", "of the", "35:31", "the maybe the Luddite is maybe a bit of", "35:35", "a negative way to phrase it but the a", "35:37", "reactionary approach of saying okay we", "35:40", "should consume less corporations are bad", "35:43", "knowledge is bad we should all get rid", "35:46", "of all those things and I think the", "35:49", "environment the modern environmental", "35:51", "movement which is we can do this", "35:53", "Romantic movement has this image of back", "35:56", "in the day everything was great and we", "35:58", "lived in harmony with nature so let's", "36:00", "get rid of all this modernity and try", "36:02", "and return to that pure original state", "36:05", "what I however believe is that first of", "36:08", "all that's I don't think it's a very", "36:10", "realistic thing people want to keep", "36:12", "their iPhones and their cars and you", "36:15", "know people want to move forward and at", "36:18", "the same time I don't think it's really", "36:19", "the most effective way to to solve these", "36:21", "problems because it would be like", "36:23", "fighting a leopard tank with bow and", "36:26", "arrow you know technology is nothing", "36:28", "more than an enabler of human", "36:31", "capabilities it enhances our power so", "36:34", "why not use that power to also try and", "36:36", "solve these these these problems as well", "36:39", "so rather than try and reject business", "36:42", "reject technology I truly believe that", "36:43", "we should embrace those those forces", "36:47", "that make us human and and has created", "36:49", "this amazing world to also try and solve", "36:52", "these these negative side effects as", "36:54", "well and that's why I believe you know", "36:56", "the over camp overconsumption of fish is", "36:58", "not going to end by

- it has a more", "41:31", "morality so what that means is that as", "41:34", "long as we consequent consistently", "41:37", "develop net positive technologies you", "41:40", "know eventually the world does get", "41:43", "better and better if say to not only 60%", "41:45", "Goods and maybe has 40% downside and", "41:50", "okay but then we can invent a solution", "41:53", "for that 40 percent

kids to use your", "42:59", "energy in a positive direction", "43:01", "you know Ken it can be done yeah sure I", "43:06", "mean I think we agree with your yeah do", "43:10", "you think that I mean when you're", "43:13", "looking at this this possibility of", "43:15", "getting 50% of the oceans garbage out in", "43:18", "five years do you think that's realistic", "43:20", "in terms of like the resources that you", "43:22", "have the the funding that you have and", "43:25", "all this stuff and if not how can people", "43:26", "help is there do you have a website", "43:28", "where people can yeah so so definitely", "43:32", "you know we don't yet have both you know", "43:36", "we don't have the technology ready yet", "43:38", "to to really clean up the patch the", "43:41", "river is different story we're really", "43:42", "ready to scale but on the ocean we we", "43:45", "still need some you know need some", "43:47", "iteration and of course the funding", "43:50", "isn't there yet so of course on our", "43:52", "website the ocean cleanup come people", "43:54", "can donate people can also okay cool", "43:56", "there go support the cleanup yeah and so", "43:59", "you have is it like PayPal or what is it", "44:01", "yeah anything you want and you can make", "44:03", "you can join the queue for for the", "44:07", "products though that's excellent", "44:08", "beautiful and so and are you getting a", "44:12", "lot of success with that people are", "44:14", "contributing so definitely so far has", "44:18", "been enough to keep the keep the", "44:21", "development going so it hasn't really", "44:23", "been the", "44:25", "the limiting factor but of course if we", "44:27", "want to scale we're going to need a lot", "44:29", "more resources so so definitely a lot of", "44:31", "help will be required there coming years", "44:34", "it's amazing that this is taking you so", "44:36", "long and that you've been working on it", "44:38", "so hard that you you have all this", "44:40", "energy to be able to pursue something", "44:43", "like this I mean it was there every time", "44:45", "while you're doing this would be like", "44:46", "Jesus Christ I don't know I'm gonna be", "44:48", "able to do this is it sustainable like", "44:51", "this every day no days off constant yeah", "44:54", "so part I should take a few days off", "44:56", "hell yeah oh there yeah this year has", "44:58", "been you feel guilty if you take time", "45:01", "off ah yeah you know but yeah so I", "45:06", "usually I feel that with a lot of my", "45:11", "that's pretty case for everyone that a", "45:13", "lot of my strengths are at the same time", "45:15", "also my weaknesses so I think I'm pretty", "45:19", "creative so it's good but at the same", "45:20", "time it means that you know I really", "45:24", "have to force myself to not be", "45:26", "distracted by new ideas", "45:28", "I think I'm have a good work ethic but", "45:32", "but you know the downside is that it's", "45:35", "also very hard to slow down and I do", "45:38", "realize that taking taking breaks it is", "45:45", "eventually it is better it does the best", "45:48", "ideas that I've had were during word", "45:50", "during times off really like even the", "45:53", "ocean cleanup idea was I was 16 was", "45:56", "scuba diving in Greece so I'm more", "45:58", "blessing than fish yeah that was during", "45:59", "during a break so so I should probably", "46:03", "take a few days yeah man just go you", "46:07", "know go somewhere we could just take a", "46:11", "few naps just relax recharge yeah get", "46:15", "your system back online perfectly yeah", "46:17", "though I think once I know to make is", "46:20", "that you know with everything that I've", "46:22", "ever done in my life of what's been very", "46:25", "obsessed about it and I think when you", "46:31", "know it's something that you cannot", "46:32", "really stop thinking about it", "46:34", "it's it never really feels like work", "46:37", "either", "46:38", "so it's um I had a calling well yeah I", "46:43", "just wouldn't be able to imagine just", "46:46", "having a normal job doing something", "46:48", "you're not passionate about it's so so", "46:53", "yeah I never really miserable would it", "46:57", "be to just be in an office and I've just", "47:00", "stared the clock waiting for 6:00 p.m.", "47:03", "so you can go home right it must be", "47:05", "that's like my biggest nightmare for a", "47:08", "lot of people is their life you know", "47:10", "well yeah I don't mean to offend I've", "47:12", "had anyone here but you're being nice", "47:15", "again yeah no I understand exactly", "47:20", "saying and a lot of people don't realize", "47:23", "that the biggest asset they have in", "47:25", "their life is their time and to spend", "47:28", "that wisely you have this is 80,000", "47:31", "hours of which I believe is like you", "47:34", "know 40 40 years 40 hours a week turns", "47:37", "out to that's 80,000 hours that you can", "47:40", "use for anything and and I do believe", "47:44", "that people often have a lot more", "47:48", "potential than than what they turn out", "47:51", "to be doing if they if they were to", "47:54", "realize how valuable that time is and", "47:58", "sort of the classic model also for more", "48:03", "wealthy people is to to work very hard", "48:06", "and then to kind of donate here and", "48:09", "there but probably you could be a lot", "48:11", "more effective if you were to just use", "48:14", "your brain use your time directly on you", "48:18", "know working something that matters", "48:20", "well I think what you just said is like", "48:22", "legitimate inspiration talk you know", "48:26", "there's a lot of people that write a", "48:29", "book you should well you mean just a", "48:31", "video I think it's good enough just a", "48:32", "video of you explaining your philosophy", "48:34", "you have accomplished so much and your", "48:36", "idea your that you're doing is so noble", "48:39", "and actually effective there's something", "48:41", "that people need to hear sometimes about", "48:43", "different people's philosophies on how", "48:46", "to spend their time and their energy and", "48:47", "your your perception of instead of", "48:49", "wasting it on", "48:51", "other things just concentrate on", "48:53", "something that you think is going to", "48:54", "make an impact something that you're", "48:55", "drawn to something that and yeah when", "48:57", "you do that then you have a cause and", "48:59", "you have a thing that you're working", "49:00", "towards it's not just simply showing up", "49:03", "and doing something that someone's", "49:04", "paying you to do that you don't", "49:05", "necessarily want to do which is a lot of", "49:07", "a trap a lot of people find themselves", "49:08", "in that trap and yeah they need to hear", "49:10", "people like you talk sometimes that's", "49:12", "that that's as inspirational as anyone", "49:15", "who's like a professional inspirational", "49:18", "or motivational speaker for a lot of", "49:19", "folks maybe more so because you're", "49:21", "actually doing something yeah well", "49:23", "probably my my words carry more", "49:25", "credibility once the oceans are actually", "49:27", "clean and yeah it'll help but just in", "49:30", "fact you get to cargo holds filled with", "49:32", "two cargo containers I mean who the fuck", "49:34", "has that no one you know come on big", "49:37", "blob some bags yeah you know and on the", "49:39", "river sweet yeah I've heard that amount", "49:42", "every day no really yeah every day on", "49:45", "the rivers Wow", "49:45", "did the river when you see that horrible", "49:49", "pollution drifting down river when you", "49:52", "see that stuff does that feel almost", "49:54", "like impossible to capture all of it or", "49:57", "pointless because people keep throwing", "49:58", "it in there well that's that's the thing", "50:01", "so we don't position this these", "50:04", "interceptors as being the solution the", "50:07", "ultimate solution for the hopeless oh of", "50:09", "course eventually you have to make sure", "50:11", "plastic doesn't end up in the ocean or", "50:13", "in the rivers in the first place right", "50:15", "so but I was standing so few weeks ago", "50:18", "was in in Indonesia and Malaysia to see", "50:21", "the machines and talk with you know", "50:23", "government people there and I was", "50:25", "standing on the Interceptor and you see", "50:28", "this constant very torrent of plastic", "50:32", "going into the Interceptor and from and", "50:36", "I was looking upstream and I realized", "50:37", "well there's there's more than five", "50:40", "million people living in the catchment", "50:42", "area of this river and they have limited", "50:45", "infrastructure they consume so much and", "50:49", "just trying to imagine all that plastic", "50:55", "not ending up in the river with just", "50:58", "such a diffused source five million", "51:01", "people it was just so hard to imagine", "51:04", "and of course", "51:05", "that's where we have to go to but", "51:08", "realistically speaking its is going to", "51:11", "take is going to take a while it's going", "51:14", "to take maybe two decades three decades", "51:16", "something like that so I think rather", "51:20", "than kind of staring at kind of the", "51:24", "perfect solution and really just working", "51:28", "on on that which of course it's very", "51:30", "important I think we also need to be a", "51:33", "bit more pragmatic and also realized", "51:35", "well okay they may take 20-30 years", "51:38", "let's at least make sure that during", "51:40", "those twenty thirty years we don't have", "51:42", "ten million kilos of plastic flowing out", "51:44", "of this river in the ocean so you'd have", "51:46", "to have some sort of cooperation with", "51:47", "the people that are doing that and", "51:49", "chucking that plastic into the river so", "51:50", "yeah yeah so somebody's got to figure", "51:53", "out a way to get to them so I do hope", "51:55", "that the interceptors can have a", "51:57", "positive influence upstream as well or", "52:00", "people say oh I don't worry about it", "52:03", "they're gonna think now yeah it's the", "52:05", "best place to throw your plastic because", "52:06", "they got a thing guilt free dumping yeah", "52:10", "no no side that that hazardous copy or", "52:15", "that risk is called moral hazards and", "52:18", "it's a phrase from economics where in in", "52:21", "the insurance industry it's kind of a", "52:23", "thing where people make more damage once", "52:27", "they are in short because we're all", "52:28", "worried I don't buy it that much as an", "52:32", "argument for for the plastic problem", "52:35", "because it's not like it's a it's a", "52:38", "conscious cost-benefit analysis whether", "52:40", "you going to throw something on the", "52:42", "street or not it's more of a unconscious", "52:45", "thing you just do it right or at least I", "52:47", "hope you don't but some people do and", "52:50", "and then it's with that same logic why", "52:57", "maybe municipality should also stop", "53:00", "sweeping the streets and maybe we", "53:02", "shouldn't even collect garbage at", "53:03", "people's houses because I'd only", "53:05", "incentivizes the creation of garbage so", "53:07", "so I I don't think that it's not you", "53:10", "know and then there's this other effect", "53:14", "called the broken window effect which", "53:18", "where I think it was back in the sixties", "53:20", "in New York what they found is that in", "53:22", "streets and neighborhoods where you have", "53:25", "buildings that show obvious sign of", "53:27", "decay like broken wheat that's where the", "53:29", "name comes from broken windows or litter", "53:31", "that actually would incentivize other", "53:34", "unlawful activities so the similar", "53:38", "effect has been observed with like a", "53:40", "park if a park doesn't have any litter", "53:42", "people litter less than when there is", "53:44", "litter on the ground so so Roger I think", "53:46", "is the opposite if you if you truly", "53:48", "believe that the ocean is going to be", "53:50", "polluted forever and it doesn't really", "53:53", "matter it's already dirty yeah that's", "53:57", "not really a strong motivation to to not", "54:00", "litter but if you say okay well ocean is", "54:03", "clean now then they love effort for that", "54:06", "and yeah once once it's clean I think", "54:10", "that would actually be a motivation to", "54:12", "to to not bitter I think you're a", "54:14", "hundred percent right I think some of", "54:16", "those videos where you see shorelines", "54:19", "that are so thick I don't know what part", "54:21", "of the world it is but that are so thick", "54:23", "with plastic you can't even get into the", "54:25", "water like you can't wait out there and", "54:27", "swim yes it's it's so disheartening and", "54:29", "you you wonder where the world will be", "54:32", "if not for people like you that are", "54:33", "trying to come up with a solution where", "54:35", "the world will be in 50 years 50 years", "54:38", "ago this wasn't the case now it is if", "54:41", "you could see like a time-lapse video of", "54:43", "these oceans from like go back to 1900", "54:47", "to 2019 and then go back before 1900", "54:50", "does is relatively unchanged for", "54:52", "thousands of years right and then also", "54:54", "this massive change very quickly with", "54:57", "the Industrial Age yeah but again I", "54:59", "believe this is a transition phase it's", "55:01", "like our modern civilization being in", "55:07", "its sort of teenage years and yes I have", "55:11", "to grow out of it and couldn't agree", "55:14", "more I I hope I hope this worry that we", "55:18", "all have will translate into improvement", "55:21", "in progress and I always say the same", "55:23", "thing that we're in some sort of", "55:24", "adolescent stage of society and", "55:27", "evolution that we're in this weird sort", "55:29", "of state where we're aware of how", "55:31", "we can change our environment but also", "55:33", "still contributing to the detriment of", "55:35", "our environment in a non sustainable way", "55:38", "and then eventually it's gonna have to", "55:39", "come to a head you know when you see", "55:41", "people screaming about climate change", "55:42", "and all these different things I mean", "55:44", "this is people realizing that this is", "55:46", "there's a lot going on that maybe not", "55:48", "everyone is completely and totally aware", "55:50", "of and but I'm with you I'm I think it's", "55:55", "it's good to be optimistic it's", "55:57", "healthier to be positive and I think it", "55:59", "is it's logical that people will find a", "56:02", "way out of this I really do yeah well", "56:05", "you know I'm not sure whether will be", "56:09", "right I think not sure either I I hope", "56:12", "we are that I think and I you know I", "56:15", "think eventually it's going to be fine", "56:17", "it's just a question of how long is it", "56:19", "going to take how much damage will have", "56:21", "been done in that period but", "56:23", "realistically it's it's the only way", "56:25", "there is a chance that we fare this out", "56:29", "right so have you faced in the", "56:30", "opposition to this is there anybody that", "56:32", "thinks is a fruitless idea yeah I know", "56:33", "there were people that were actually I", "56:35", "was very shocked", "56:36", "I read people that were actually happy", "56:37", "that your project didn't work the first", "56:39", "time", "56:40", "hey what the fuck man there's people", "56:42", "that I think it's a thing like cuz", "56:46", "you're this really hopeful young", "56:49", "intelligent guy who comes up with the", "56:51", "solution I think it probably was you", "56:53", "think he's so fuckin smart front-cam I", "56:55", "hope it fails and when it failed people", "56:57", "actually enjoyed it yeah yeah is that", "57:00", "did that hurt no so for me so yes of", "57:06", "course since the really since the", "57:09", "beginning 2013 there have been people", "57:11", "yeah like relatively small group of", "57:14", "people that have been people that have", "57:15", "been opposing it and most of them", "57:18", "ironically enough are people that care", "57:21", "about the ocean because they don't feel", "57:22", "it's the right way to to to check the", "57:26", "issue and but the way I deal with it is", "57:30", "at least what I used to do in the", "57:32", "beginning now they're fortunate there", "57:34", "aren't many new arguments anymore but", "57:35", "just better get right them out every", "57:38", "single argument rationally analyze them", "57:40", "know emotions emotions only model your", "57:44", "your thinking", "57:45", "way and make a distinction okay is this", "57:48", "something where this person has a point", "57:49", "if so great because rather have somebody", "57:53", "else pointing it out to me then us", "57:54", "having to learn it in the field and you", "57:57", "know having a having unnecessary failure", "57:59", "and if the person doesn't have a point", "58:01", "if it's just you know assumption or", "58:04", "unfounded or whatever now then is very", "58:07", "easy for me to just ignore it and so and", "58:10", "then the question is well what motivates", "58:12", "people to be negative and I think", "58:15", "there's pretty for reasons first of all", "58:16", "it's it's no genuine skepticism whether", "58:19", "it can be done and I think that's how", "58:22", "that's healthy and I think we've proved", "58:25", "most of those arguments wrong now but of", "58:28", "course there's still you know the whole", "58:29", "scale-up thing which it's to have to do", "58:31", "so so bit of that but it's kind of", "58:34", "morphing now to a few other things like", "58:36", "one thing is human risk perception which", "58:42", "sometimes I think is a it's a cause of", "58:47", "some opposition where it's very easy for", "58:54", "people to ignore the baseline when they", "58:56", "look at risks so you know you can for", "59:00", "example say okay nuclear power super", "59:04", "risky we shouldn't do that but then if", "59:06", "you compared to the baseline of other", "59:08", "sources of energy it's actually probably", "59:11", "the least risky source of energy there", "59:14", "is even solar energy is causes more", "59:18", "deaths per megawatt hour then then", "59:22", "nuclear power because people fall off", "59:24", "roofs so so it's really so if you ignore", "59:27", "the baseline and if you say okay doing", "59:32", "this cleanup we shouldn't do it because", "59:34", "there's all these potential risks right", "59:36", "of you know potentially there's some sea", "59:40", "life that may be caught potentially", "59:42", "there are these moral hazards there's", "59:46", "all these risks and you know basically", "59:47", "best thing to do is not do it what", "59:50", "people then are ignoring is sort of the", "59:52", "certain hazard off these hundreds of", "59:56", "millions of kilos of plastic that's", "59:58", "already in the ocean and", "59:59", "if you were to kind of pose the opposite", "60:02", "question to say okay so if we were to go", "60:06", "to the ocean right now and just dump the", "60:09", "equivalent amount of plastic that we", "60:10", "were to take out would dump it into the", "60:12", "ocean would you would you think that's a", "60:15", "good plan and then well probably the", "60:17", "answer is is no so so I think there's", "60:19", "there's a bit of this you know of course", "60:23", "of course what we're doing it's new", "60:25", "there are risks involved but as long as", "60:27", "we map them well we take things step by", "60:31", "step I think they're manageable and", "60:33", "they're definitely not risks or reasons", "60:35", "to do not do it because of course the", "60:37", "baseline is that there is already doing", "60:39", "a lot of harm being done by the status",

is such a thing as human nature", "70:09", "but then there is this whole sort of", "70:12", "cultural layer but that but we humans", "70:15", "created around us which I called a", "70:19",

alone", "82:56", "yeah both of them scare the shit out of", "82:58", "me every time I talk about it yeah Sam", "83:01", "Sam Sam and I did an episode and I where", "83:05", "he talked about artificial

have a very I suppose a", "83:27", "very optimistic and pessimistic view of", "83:30", "technology at the same time I think on", "83:32", "one hand it allows us to to improve the", "83:37", "world and that's what we've seen and", "83:38", "it's it's gradual and it continues", "83:40", "probably because people want to solve", "83:44", "their own problems and with that", "83:45", "inadvertently solve other people's", "83:47", "problems that's progress happens I", "83:49", "believe but then at the same time while", "83:52", "the world is getting a lot better it's", "83:54", "also getting riskier I mean two thousand", "83:58", "years ago or maybe even two hundred", "83:59", "years ago there was no way to wipe out", "84:01", "humanity that simply wasn't if you even", "84:05", "if you wanted to to

quite a few corporation", "84:28", "- maybe right even everyone I think", "84:31", "there's a there's this this sort of", "84:35", "brain teaser or mental experiment that", "84:38", "Nick Bostrom came

point in time we", "84:50", "would just not be economically feasible", "84:52", "anymore to rebuild cities because I", "84:58", "don't know it's on one hand you know and", "85:01", "so I think that's kind of the this this", "85:04", "the scary you know risky aspect of it", "85:07", "but at the same time when you think of", "85:09", "it", "85:10", "I would much rather trust or n trust and",

seems weird see", "86:21", "there's so much of it that seems like", "86:22", "boy this is okay a few weeks ago I saw", "86:25", "like a duck in a palm just making an", "86:27", "infinite sir because I said that's", "86:28", "definitely a glitch yeah yeah yeah", "86:32", "someone needs to fix the code yeah yeah", "86:38", "of course it's lots of fun to think", "86:41", "about those things but", "86:42", "you know rennet II well that's what's", "86:45", "the depressing things that we'll likely", "86:47", "never know wow maybe maybe one time", "86:49", "somebody will figure out the solution", "86:51", "and dystopian view of the futures it's I", "86:54", "mean I get I get the perspective I get", "86:58", "the dystopian perspective but right now", "87:00", "as we said like you know according to", "87:02", "Pinker according to statistics things", "87:04", "are really better than they've been", "87:05", "before and my concern is that but my", "87:09", "concern is what one of the things that", "87:11", "Ilan said that where the biological", "87:13", "bootloader correct artificial life I", "87:15", "mean look when a caterpillar makes a", "87:18", "cocoon it doesn't know what the fuck", "87:20", "it's doing it just does it you know just", "87:22", "makes the cocoon it becomes a butterfly", "87:24", "well you know we're buying the iPhone 36", "87:27", "and the cyber trucks and trying to get a", "87:30", "solar-powered plane right off the ground", "87:33", "we're probably giving into this thing or", "87:37", "this look what we have right now is more", "87:40", "than sufficient for survival if we just", "87:42", "decided if we got all the people in the", "87:44", "world say hey watches we make watches", "87:47", "that keep perfect time computers they", "87:50", "get online it's great you can download", "87:51", "YouTube videos cameras they're very", "87:54", "clear they take very clear pictures okay", "87:56", "CTV's look great everything looks great", "87:59", "internet speeds pretty fucking good man", "88:02", "especially 5g let's stop yeah", "88:05", "everybody stop stop stop making stuff", "88:08", "stop it just met everything we have", "88:10", "right now just keep making it no no new", "88:13", "innovation let's just enjoy life", "88:14", "together right that sounds like it's", "88:17", "that sounds so logical but yet also so", "88:20",

"88:29", "and keep you comfort at night it's", "88:31", "they're gonna figure out better stuff no", "88:34", "matter what forever it's part of what", "88:35", "makes people people we have this", "88:37", "unquenchable thirst for innovation", "88:40", "that's one of the weird things that", "88:42", "freaks me out about this move towards", "88:44", "technology is that materialism which", "88:48", "seems to be this like really standard", "88:51", "behavior with a giant percentage of the", "88:54", "population like people", "88:56", "really into things and this desire to", "88:59",

"89:13", "better and better and a lot of it is", "89:15", "fueled by this weird desire that people", "89:17", "have for stuff sure which doesn't make", "89:19", "any sense like how where'd that come", "89:21", "from well that might be the stuff that", "89:23", "makes the caterpillar make the cocoon", "89:25", "yeah I mean it's probably just making", "89:28", "use of the same biological mechanisms as", "89:31", "social media right it's you feel like", "89:33", "you need it", "89:34", "yep tricks little tricks oh yeah and", "89:37", "next thing you know they go listen we", "89:38", "have two options", "89:39", "either we let artificial life take over", "89:43", "and be the superior life form or we", "89:44", "merge well it's just smart let's just", "89:47", "make friends yeah just make friends with", "89:48", "artificial intelligence take this little", "89:51", "chip boy huh yeah well so probably if", "89:53", "it's possible and it likely is it's", "89:59", "probably pretty inevitable that it's", "90:01", "going to happen I think it was Edison", "90:04", "that said that I never invented anything", "90:08", "I just took elements of was there", "90:11", "probably the quote is a lot better than", "90:13", "I'm paraphrasing now but it's kind of if", "90:18", "it's possible you know it's kind of yes", "90:21", "there it's right it should be already", "90:23", "invented yes", "90:24", "you just have to discover it Marcia so", "90:28", "sir probably that's going to happen but", "90:29", "what does give me hope is that to my", "90:32", "point of the nuclear detonator thousand", "90:37", "years ago for this now it seems like we", "90:39", "are getting more responsible and our", "90:44", "ability to foresee the future allows us", "90:47", "to invent things but it also allows us", "90:49", "to to kind of think about the risks and", "90:51", "to to try and mitigate the risks before", "90:55", "they they happen and I don't think", "90:57", "there's nearly is enough enough", "90:59", "attention given to these existential", "91:01", "risks but the fact that some people are", "91:06", "thinking about it is yeah", "91:09", "it's kind of hopeful no I agree I really", "91:12", "do", "91:13", "and I and I'm posing these things about", "91:15", "this dystopian potential future just", "91:17", "because really it's probably something", "91:19", "we should think about but I am hopeful", "91:21", "that as technology improves our", "91:24", "understanding of humans improves along", "91:27", "with it and and and also that perhaps", "91:30", "some technology like I'm not exactly", "91:33", "sure what this neural link thing is with", "91:36", "Elan these coming up with but I think", "91:39", "something is some of it has to do with a", "91:41",

become I mean you", "91:52", "don't want to say hopefully some fucking", "91:53", "wires they stick in your brain will", "91:55", "become standard because that seems that", "91:56", "seems like we are much to him I mean", "91:59", "that is merging right that's that's", "92:00", "that's the merge with technology", "92:03", "Marshall McLuhan said the greatest thing", "92:05", "about this said human beings of sex", "92:07", "organs of the machine world what a great", "92:10", "quote right yeah that's one of those", "92:12", "quotes you just go whoa fuck that is", "92:15", "exactly what it is the machine world", "92:17", "can't make itself needs us like if we do", "92:21", "make artificial life and McLuhan I think", "92:24", "wrote that in the 60s yeah I think", "92:26", "that's from what is the book he's got a", "92:29", "book media something but what is", "92:35", "Marshall McLuhan so so it's uh it's a", "92:39", "broader point that our full", "92:43", "understanding media or media", "92:45", "understanding media that's it for yeah", "92:47", "1964 imagine if that guy called it yeah", "92:51", "in 64 so so definitely it's it's a it's", "92:55", "a broader point of people make and that", "92:56", "we are in a way enslaved by our", "92:59", "technology and that I think in the book", "93:03", "sapiens by Harari yeah", "93:05", "great book he makes the point about", "93:07", "grain enslaving us because the", "93:11", "Agricultural Revolution ten thousand", "93:13", "years ago they we didn't really become", "93:17", "better according to him it was less", "93:19",

inferior position yeah", "93:47", "and yeah so so you know of course the", "93:50", "risk with artificial intelligence is", "93:52", "that a similar thing happens and that's", "93:56", "not very benign and yeah we didn't", "94:00", "foresee those consequences that we will", "94:03", "be locked in in the year 2065 it's one", "94:07", "of the more fascinating things about", "94:08", "people
