"07:26", "have to", "07:26", "follow the evidence wherever it goes and", "07:29", "that's always been my rule of thumb", "07:31", "that not everything is always the way", "07:34", "people say it is

really that", "07:55", "maybe it was older than the pyramids", "07:57", "that maybe it goes back", "07:58", "earlier so i felt that it wasn't", "08:02", "all said and done and you know pat and", "08:05", "sound that the egyptologists necessarily", "08:07", "knew what they were talking about in", "08:08", "modern times because some of the", "08:11", "earlier egyptologists who they held in",

"08:20", "i my grandmother who i mentioned", "08:23", "a second ago uh was a theosophist", "08:27", "and the if you know anything about", "08:28", "theosophy it", "08:30", "also suggests that you know maybe", "08:33", "there's things that go back earlier", "08:35", "i don't know what is a theosophist a", "08:37", "theosophist it's it's uh how do i", "08:40", "explain it", "08:41", "have you heard

"09:13", "i'm a theosophist", "09:15", "but reading theosophical works on top of", "09:18", "everything else", "09:19", "allowed me i think to expand my horizons", "09:22", "and to see that", "09:23",

got", "09:52", "involved with this", "09:53", "if i looked at it critically the", "09:55", "evidence was", "09:56", "not that definitive for the age of the", "09:59", "sphinx", "10:00", "so i was

exaggerating 30 to 120", "10:36", "seconds of first scene", "10:38", "yeah it really did what was your first", "10:40", "impression because my first impression", "10:41", "of the sphinx was", "10:42", "now that i saw it on the ground in", "10:45", "person there was something wrong with", "10:47", "the egyptological", "10:48", "dating because when you look at the", "10:51", "sphinx", "10:53", "as a

has", "11:21", "not", "11:22", "been to egypt they should realize", "11:25", "that when they carve the sphinx it's all", "11:27", "solid bedrock", "11:28", "only the head initially was above the", "11:31", "ground surface", "11:32", "you carved they carved down into the", "11:35", "rock", "11:35", "to free up the body what i call the core", "11:38", "body of the sphinx", "11:40", "and it's that

with pickaxes and that type", "12:32", "of thing", "12:33", "shoveled out chips of rock in baskets", "12:36", "that would have been the easy way", "12:37", "what they did is they carved out huge",

due east of", "12:50", "the sphinx and built", "12:52", "what is now known as the sphinx temple", "12:54", "which is still there in ruinous", "12:56", "condition and the valley temple so you",

it", "13:25", "and were built contemporaneously so", "13:27", "jamie pulled up two photos here", "13:29", "the first one that he pulled up was a", "13:31", "computer image that showed", "13:32", "the sphinx and showed oh hey i'm looking", "13:35", "at it now yes", "13:36", "and and in this image what you can see", "13:39", "that's a computer image that's actually", "13:41", "from mystery of the sphinx", "13:42", "and then there's a inset that's an", "13:45", "aerial photograph", "13:46", "the real thing and that shows how when", "13:48", "they were carving the body", "13:50", "they cut out huge blocks and then put", "13:53", "them in position", "13:54", "to make what's known as the sphinx", "13:56", "temple do east of the sphincter and the", "13:58", "second image", "13:59", "is the sphinx temple okay you look at", "14:01", "this it says the sphinx faces due east", "14:04", "the rising sun and right in front of it", "14:06", "is the sphinx temple", "14:08", "so this is a

"14:18", "in this image another uh picture of the", "14:21", "sphinx temple", "14:22", "and so these erosions and you can see", "14:24", "how big they", "14:25", "are you can see how big they are they're", "14:27", "enormous okay", "14:29", "these erosion features on the blocks", "14:31", "don't worry about them for the moment", "14:32", "okay", "14:33", "let's go back to the sphinx enclosure", "14:35", "itself it's a sphinx enclosure", "14:37", "where you see the rolling undulating", "14:41", "profile the erosional features here you", "14:44", "see it in that picture", "14:45",

know", "21:54", "that's very localized we think", "21:56", "this is very localized right um but", "21:59", "if you have a major solar outburst", "22:01", "manager coronal mass ejections", "22:03",

"22:52", "well it must be a comet or an asteroid", "22:55", "but you're not finding the craters", "22:57", "you're not finding other things", "22:59", "so what i'm finding or my own research", "23:03", "is i'm coming to conclude that it wasn't", "23:06", "a", "23:07", "physical object that hit us it was a", "23:10", "solar outburst", "23:11", "that's the general term i used is it", "23:13", "possible that it was both", "23:14", "um actually there's it's quite possible", "23:17", "that it could have been both yeah there", "23:20", "could have been fragments of both i i", "23:22", "can address that", "23:23", "um and there's a couple of aspects to", "23:26", "both when you say both", "23:28", "there's indications that comets diving", "23:31", "into the sun", "23:32", "actually cause coronal mass ejections to", "23:34", "correlate it with disturbing the sun", "23:37", "so in some cases you'll have the i'll", "23:40", "call it the comet group", "23:41", "talking about how we go through these", "23:43", "comet streams periodically", "23:45", "i agree 100 in fact i talk about this in", "23:48", "some of my early books because i really", "23:49", "was into comets at the time", "23:51", "voyages of the pyramid builders for", "23:53", "instance i talked about", "23:55", "how comets might have begun and ended", "23:57", "the younger driest", "23:58", "but i wasn't thinking about solar", "24:00", "activity at that time seriously", "24:02", "as no one else was but we now find that", "24:05", "comets diving into the sun", "24:07", "when we go through comet streams that", "24:08", "can set off solar activity", "24:11", "so in fact i think it could be both but", "24:14", "it could be that the comets are", "24:15", "affecting the sun which is then", "24:17", "affecting the earth rather than directly", "24:20", "if that makes sense", "24:21", "yes and the other thing is that people", "24:24", "have to understand there's a couple of", "24:25", "things going on", "24:26", "the younger driest 10 900 bc", "24:30", "when it first begins as a cooling period", "24:33", "it's not", "24:33", "as dramatic a climate change as you have", "24:36", "at 9700 bc", "24:38",

oh there yeah there we", "24:51", "have some isotope data", "24:52", "and what we have at 9700 bc and this is", "24:57", "based on sediment cores and ice cores we", "24:59", "also have", "25:00", "lunar data that supports us at 9 700 bc", "25:03", "we have incredible climatic change", "25:06", "going from you know deep ice age to", "25:09", "modern warming", "25:10", "and this literally now based on what", "25:12", "they call microstratigraphy", "25:14", "from greenland ice cores can be dated", "25:16", "within", "25:18", "get this weeks to days wow so this", "25:21", "happened literally we're talking", "25:23", "virtually overnight when i was a", "25:24", "graduate student we thought things said", "25:26", "happened suddenly we were talking", "25:28", "thousands of years", "25:29",

incredible yeah", "25:40", "so i think this ties in art supports", "25:43", "that there was a massive solar event in", "25:45", "9700 bc", "25:47", "uh what we had uh just a slide a minute", "25:50", "ago when i saw it out", "25:52", "the side of my eye was a graph of based", "25:55", "on isotope data's what they call proxies", "25:58", "of solar activity again based on", "26:01", "primarily ice core", "26:02", "sediment course and the sun was", "26:04", "incredibly active", "26:06", "in 9700 bc and shortly after there", "26:10", "and it had huge if you think of it", "26:11", "anthropomorphically", "26:13", "mood swings would be very active then", "26:15", "would go very still then very active", "26:17", "again very still", "26:19", "and this happened for some thousands of", "26:21", "years", "26:22", "and then it evened out um the sunserv", "26:25", "became quiescent", "26:27", "it was during this quiescence period", "26:29", "that time back into human", "26:32", "civilization civilization was able to", "26:34", "re-emerge", "26:35", "redevelop again and we've had incredibly", "26:39", "good conditions should we say for the", "26:41", "last five thousand years", "26:43", "quiet conditions stable conditions on", "26:46", "earth for civilization to re-emerge", "26:49", "back into that theme but", "26:52", "recently the sun has become very active", "26:54", "again and we have to be very careful i'm", "26:56", "not", "26:57", "a doomsayer or a scare monger i'm not", "27:00", "trying to", "27:00", "sell people on being preppers but the", "27:03", "reality is the sun has started to become", "27:05", "active again", "27:06", "just as it was at the end of the last", "27:08", "ice age and i think this makes perfect", "27:10", "sense because the sun", "27:12", "is a star it goes through cycles like", "27:15", "other stars do and we're a little planet", "27:18", "orbiting", "27:19", "it and we're like all the other planets", "27:21", "affected", "27:22", "by it it's fascinating though that we", "27:23", "have this incredible need to keep things", "27:26", "exactly the way they are to the point", "27:27", "where", "27:27", "we were in denial about any potential", "27:30", "change even", "27:30", "if you're studying things everybody's", "27:32", "like oh it'll be fine we're so inclined", "27:35", "we're so inclined to do that it's very", "27:37", "aristotelian", "27:39", "and in fact um i forget who it was one", "27:42", "of the astrophysicists some decades ago", "27:44", "said about the sun it was sort of the", "27:46", "last vestige of aristotelianism", "27:49", "in modern science everyone assumed the", "27:51", "sun is stable", "27:52", "essentially perfect yes it goes through", "27:54", "little sun cycles of 11 and 22 years and", "27:57", "maybe some bigger ones of a few", "27:59", "centuries but no one wanted to think of", "28:02", "it as", "28:03", "what it is just a plain old star that", "28:05", "goes through", "28:06", "periods of the equilibrium we've been in", "28:10", "relative solar equilibrium for thousands", "28:12", "of years now but it goes through", "28:14", "disequilibrium and", "28:16", "has we'll call it hiccups and spurts and", "28:19", "has to recalibrate itself if you would", "28:22", "uh and we feel the effects on earth and", "28:24", "so at the end of the last ice age", "28:27", "we had this massive solar event solar", "28:30", "outburst what they call", "28:31", "um solar proton events", "28:35", "it would have messed up the ionosphere", "28:37", "caused all kinds of geomagnetic storms", "28:40", "this ties in with earthquake activity", "28:42", "that we see at the end of the last ice", "28:44", "age because we now have lots of evidence", "28:46", "that solar activity upsets the", "28:49", "magnetosphere and the magnetic", "28:51", "magnetic fields on the earth the um", "28:54", "electrical currents in the earth", "28:57", "it's i will trigger earthquakes that are", "29:00", "about to happen", "29:01", "anyway not unlike i was talking to um", "29:05", "katie my wife on the right here and a", "29:07", "good analogy", "29:08", "is when you have an avalanche that's", "29:11", "just about ready to go you can clap your", "29:13", "hands in some cases and it sets off this", "29:15", "huge avalanche", "29:16", "really yeah so solar activity is tied in", "29:20", "with", "29:20", "earth activity earthquake activity for", "29:23", "instance", "29:23", "volcanic activity so we see", "29:26", "volcanic activity increased volcanic", "29:29", "activity there was a major", "29:32", "super volcano that went off just at the", "29:35", "end of the last ice age well why", "29:38", "probably this is me speaking because of", "29:40", "the solar activity that set it off", "29:43", "so when you start getting things like", "29:44", "platinum", "29:46", "and iridium and osmium spikes", "29:49", "that's not necessarily extraterrestrial", "29:52", "that could be", "29:53", "from terrestrial volcanic activity that", "29:55", "was occurring at that", "29:57", "period so yes there's extraterrestrial", "29:59", "causes", "30:00", "but i think that there's a very strong", "30:02", "case to be made", "30:03", "that this is solar that this is the sun", "30:06", "influencing us", "30:07", "which is really important too fast", "30:09", "forward to today", "30:11", "here we are we're on skype we're using", "30:13", "all these electronic media", "30:15", "what could be more vulnerable to a solar", "30:18", "outburst", "30:19", "that kind of stuff yeah oh power grid", "30:22", "power grids power grids will be fright", "30:24", "there was a and i think we're seeing the", "30:28", "beginning of this or we saw the", "30:31", "beginning of this

right", "32:57", "rural displays but see how it starts to", "33:00", "take on a discrete structure on the", "33:01", "right there", "33:02", "and to describe it to the audience do", "33:04", "you see

thousand years ago ten", "33:41", "thousand eleven thousand", "33:43", "seven hundred years ago at the end of", "33:44", "the last ice age and you saw this", "33:46", "you would see these things in the sky oh", "33:48", "they look like gods they look like stick", "33:50", "figure humans in the sky uh you would", "33:53", "see huge", "33:54", "lightning bolts hitting parts of the", "33:57",

formation", "34:13", "yeah this is plasma discharge formation", "34:16", "plasma is essentially think of", "34:18", "is electrically charged particles", "34:20", "electrons", "34:21", "protons that

millennia", "39:36", "in some cases you know smaller ones so", "39:39", "something that was happening", "39:40", "and you see this around the world too is", "39:43", "that where people", "39:44",

got", "40:46", "literally fire coming down think of this", "40:49", "fire lightning", "40:50", "yes that is going to set things on fire", "40:52", "and you literally", "40:53", "incinerate just

there was a", "42:12", "massive", "42:13", "around the world you would have had", "42:15", "populations being constricted and then", "42:17", "they spread out again", "42:18", "and when they were

understand that and i try", "44:44", "not to be that", "44:45", "myself you know oh this is my pet theory", "44:48", "but i do try and look at the evidence i", "44:50", "think that", "44:51", "slowly

mention right now is", "45:08", "as of relatively recently not still very", "45:10", "very small", "45:11", "but at boston university i've been", "45:13", "allowed to found", "45:14", "what is called

humans", "46:30", "and one of the things that happened in", "46:31", "that documentary from 1993", "46:33", "that i was kind of stunned by was the", "46:35", "reaction", "46:36", "uh by the

punished", "47:21", "yes", "47:22", "yeah i'm sure yeah i mean you know let's", "47:24", "let's no i'll be honest you know i", "47:26", "haven't gotten necessarily the", "47:29", "i i've had colleagues say to me in", "47:32", "no uncertain terms very well meaning", "47:36", "that i could have had a wonderful career", "47:38", "and had all the promotions and", "47:40", "advancements going

really cared about", "47:52", "hmm you know i'm but you've had an", "47:54", "impact a gigantic impact on people like", "47:56", "me", "47:57", "that are really fascinated by if if i", "47:59", "had

way is where is the evidence", "48:24", "of this culture", "48:26", "well now we have go beckley texas oh", "48:28", "absolutely", "48:29", "that is the evidence because that that", "48:31", "was an",

saw", "49:15", "initially in that first 30 to 120", "49:18", "seconds", "49:19", "because that's before i brought in", "49:21", "equipment and worked with tom de becky", "49:23", "to do seismic work

you also have in egyptology", "55:27", "and i want to give you another example", "55:29", "of this not just", "55:30", "me bringing in scientific evidence and", "55:32", "data in the egyptologists

there can't be we don't", "57:31", "basically we", "57:32", "there can't be anything new that we", "57:34", "don't know about or if it is", "57:36", "it's just trivial it's just some um", "57:38",

right so you're", "58:12", "dealing with physical evidence", "58:14", "yeah that they're saying is nonsense but", "58:16", "this is not something they study in the", "58:18", "first place", "58:18",

you're seeing is what they call", "58:26", "the hidden chamber there but you can see", "58:28", "how", "58:28", "it's parallel to the grand gallery the", "58:30", "grand gallery is this huge",

"59:17", "egyptian egyptologists close to the", "59:20", "ministry", "59:20", "and my point is they've done the same", "59:22", "thing to me so for instance when we did", "59:24", "seismic work and we found the chamber", "59:26", "under the left part of the sphinx that's", "59:28", "never been explored since at least not", "59:30", "to my knowledge", "59:31", "and they just dismiss and say we know", "59:33", "there's nothing there", "59:36", "and that was despite the fact that we", "59:38", "also found a chamber at the rump of the", "59:39", "sphinx which i didn't know about the", "59:41", "time but they already knew about so", "59:43", "it confirmed that our data was good", "59:45", "because we were finding something they", "59:47", "knew about", "59:48", "but when we find something they don't", "59:49", "know about and they don't want to be", "59:51", "there", "59:52", "right they dismiss it and don't want to", "59:55", "pursue it", "59:56", "they have explored one of those chambers", "59:58", "correct is that they explore the one", "59:59", "that's in the rump", "60:00", "the one in the rump yes the one the rump", "60:02", "but it turns out they already knew about", "60:04", "it", "60:04", "it's probably not super significant it", "60:06", "probably is just maybe a greco-roman", "60:09", "or late period you know", "60:12", "burial or or some kind of excavation the", "60:15", "one i believe is important", "60:16", "is under the left paw of the sphinx", "60:19", "which i believe is uh", "60:20", "archive actually may go back to this", "60:23", "very early period because we now have", "60:25", "hieroglyphic evidence indicating that", "60:28", "what is the evidence indicates it's an", "60:30", "archive", "60:30", "okay so recently and this gets back to", "60:34", "um the sphinx yes okay so we started", "60:38", "this portion of the discussion with the", "60:40", "sphinx and my initial observations of", "60:42", "the sphinx", "60:42", "and one of my observations was that", "60:45", "there's something going on with the", "60:47", "weathering ero", "60:48", "and erosion on the sphinx the second", "60:51", "observation this is within the first two", "60:53", "minutes at most", "60:55", "was that the head is too small for the", "60:57", "body", "60:58", "the head is not eroded the way the core", "61:01", "body is it's not erode the way the walls", "61:03", "of the sphinx enclosure are", "61:05", "it's not the original head i", "61:09", "hate to say it this way but i knew", "61:10", "immediately that was not", "61:12", "the original head you know just from a", "61:14", "geological point of view", "61:15", "right and i believe that's now since", "61:17", "been fully confirmed that this is not", "61:19", "the original head it was a re-carved", "61:21", "head", "61:22", "so for a long time the question has been", "61:25", "in my mind and we talk about this even", "61:27", "on mystery of the sphinx", "61:28", "what was the original head of the sphinx", "61:30", "what was the sphinx originally", "61:33", "we've speculated and other people", "61:35", "speculate might have been", "61:36", "a lion for instance leo because it faces", "61:40", "on the equinox the constellation leo", "61:44", "in the sky not today", "61:48", "but 10 000 bc or so more or less", "61:51", "at the very end of the last ice age now", "61:53", "i've had a lot of colleagues of mine", "61:56", "academic colleagues say that's nonsense", "61:58", "you know it doesn't mean anything", "61:59", "because they weren't even recognizing", "62:01", "the consolations back then", "62:03", "um we now have plenty of evidence that", "62:06", "at least some of the constellations that", "62:08", "we recognize today", "62:10", "uh leo i would put in that category uh", "62:13", "taurus is in that category orion is in", "62:16", "that court", "62:17", "category some of them we don't have", "62:19", "evidence for but the ones i just", "62:21", "mentioned", "62:22", "the um these are constellations that go", "62:26", "back", "62:26", "well into the end of the last ice age we", "62:29", "have documents of that we have", "62:31", "mammoth bones where you have orion", "62:33", "carved on it we have", "62:34", "taurus shown in cave walls we have leo", "62:37", "shown", "62:37", "so it's to me it's fascinating that some", "62:40", "of these constellations that we", "62:42", "recognize today", "62:43", "were recognized tens of thousands of", "62:45", "years ago so", "62:46", "to me it's not nonsense that they carved", "62:49", "a structure", "62:51", "10 000 bc approximately that was facing", "62:54", "its own image in the sky", "62:55", "so one suggestion was that maybe it's", "62:57", "leo but", "62:58", "recently um monu manuscripts today dr", "63:02", "manu savesade", "63:03", "another colleague of mine he recognized", "63:06", "initially that there is a title what's", "63:09", "known as a dual title", "63:12", "in

look at the actual image and", "65:05", "then above it", "65:06", "is uh ax so it's an axe", "65:10", "yeah it's it's a a primitive axe", "65:13", "um when i say primitive even for the", "65:15",

"65:46", "it up on the board now", "65:48", "if you look at you've got the lioness", "65:51", "with the key", "65:52", "and you also have a line is not in that", "65:55", "image but a different

thought", "77:20", "about going to egypt", "77:22", "was how egyptologists are resistant to", "77:26", "scientific information", "77:27", "and scientific data and how to", "77:30", "help you know try to overcome that if", "77:33", "you're working with egyptologists", "77:34", "basically", "77:35", "which the answer was it's very difficult", "77:38", "and it's not to put them down because i", "77:39", "have lots of colleagues in other fields", "77:41", "that are not sciences", "77:43", "right um but classically i would contend", "77:46", "egyptology is not a science it comes", "77:48",

field", "78:07", "that's so far apart and so diverse", "78:10", "from what they understand what they know", "78:13", "their own", "78:14", "mindset yeah and their mindset is not", "78:17", "geared

know i know", "79:04", "i'm still getting attacked and i'm still", "79:07", "you know um", "79:08", "the answer is no i was naive i was", "79:10", "incredibly naive at the time", "79:13", "i still was not that far out of graduate", "79:17", "school", "79:17", "you thought you could just present yeah", "79:25", "exactly that was it and i was so naive", "79:28", "and so we first present the evidence at", "79:30", "the geological society of america", "79:32", "annual meeting in 1991 i guess it was", "79:36", "yeah 1991 and i want to say bluntly", "79:41", "the vast majority of geologists you know", "79:43", "hundreds literally thought oh this is", "79:45", "amazing this is great it may", "79:47", "start making some headlines around the", "79:49", "world literally", "79:51", "there were one or two geologists there", "79:54", "that turns out", "79:56", "turns out we're working for", "79:57", "egyptologists they didn't think this was", "79:59", "so great because they saw the", "80:01", "implications for the egyptological", "80:03", "colleagues", "80:04", "and they started you know a little", "80:05", "rumbling there then the journalists come", "80:08", "in back then you know no internet like", "80:10", "we have it now", "80:11", "just phones and the journalists start", "80:13", "calling egyptologists that were not", "80:16", "there had not seen the data etc", "80:18",

know two or three centuries which is", "80:28", "total nonsense it turns out i knew every", "80:31", "egyptologist because there's so few that", "80:34", "have actually studied the sphinx", "80:35", "personally", "80:36", "it's really just two martial", "80:40", "so so yeah they were just trying to", "80:41", "dismiss it and then the egyptologists", "80:43", "come back and say we know this is", "80:44", "nonsense essentially i'm paraphrasing", "80:47", "we know that the pyramids were not built", "80:50", "by aliens so they start bringing aliens", "80:52", "and ufos", "80:53", "essentially just to dismiss you dismiss", "80:55", "me and i wasn't talking about total", "80:57", "drama yeah i wasn't talking about um", "80:59", "pyramids", "81:00", "number one we could talk about that if", "81:02", "you want to and i wasn't talking about", "81:03", "aliens they hadn't been there they", "81:05", "hadn't seen the data", "81:07", "it was so bizarre in hindsight and i was", "81:10", "so frustrated", "81:12", "trying to defend their positions yeah", "81:14", "and they were just", "81:15", "they were really just attacking and then", "81:18", "in egypt at one point they were", "81:20", "um putting things in the arabic press", "81:23", "little did they know i have enough", "81:25", "friends that would read it to me", "81:26", "and they were saying that i wasn't even", "81:28", "a faculty member at boston university", "81:30", "which is outright lie since i just been", "81:32", "tenured", "81:33", "so there was no doubt i was a faculty", "81:35", "member there but this was other", "81:37", "academics saying this but they never", "81:39", "thought it would get back to me", "81:41", "i mean really really mean and nasty", "81:44", "um so getting back to the evidence so", "81:47", "they set up", "81:48", "and this was i think unprecedented", "81:50", "within months they'd set up this", "81:52", "debate at the aaas american association", "81:55", "for the advancement of science", "81:57", "and i thought again i was so naive i", "82:00", "thought", "82:00", "oh this is wonderful finally we'll get", "82:03", "rid of all this nonsense in this name", "82:05", "calling and", "82:06", "you know the stuff in the popular press", "82:08", "that you know journalists", "82:10", "you can't blame them they don't know", "82:11", "what's going on necessarily and we'll", "82:13", "really get the evidence out and we'll be", "82:15", "able to discuss it", "82:17", "um sanely and objectively turns out that", "82:20", "wasn't the case at all it was just", "82:22", "from my perspective they were just", "82:25", "calling me more names and", "82:27", "trying to set up straw men and is this", "82:29", "egyptologist who was in that documentary", "82:30", "who dismissed everything yeah that was", "82:32", "marxist he's still around", "82:33", "oh yeah and has he amended his position", "82:36", "at all", "82:36", "not to my knowledge i haven't spoken", "82:39", "with him for", "82:40", "years and years and years right did you", "82:42", "ever speak with him off the record or", "82:44", "personally oh i feel yeah what is this", "82:46", "yeah oh", "82:47", "i i'll tell you this is what he didn't", "82:49", "say was off the record i was", "82:50", "i guess was off the record i don't think", "82:52", "i would have said this years ago but", "82:53", "i'll say it now", "82:54", "at that debate at that debate triple a s", "82:58", "debate he i just", "83:01", "suddenly found him myself in the hall", "83:04", "with him and there was no one else", "83:05", "around", "83:06", "so he could totally deny this but it's", "83:08", "true", "83:09", "my perspective at least he", "83:13", "said something to me like you know you", "83:15", "don't really believe this i know you", "83:17", "don't really believe this you just want", "83:18", "to be on television", "83:20", "and you know be famous or something like", "83:24", "that he said i said no i i", "83:26", "really do believe it or you know i", "83:29", "really go by the evidence and i do think", "83:31", "the evidence says this and he sort of", "83:33", "was telling me that no you don't you", "83:35", "know he was like", "83:36", "i don't know analyzing me advertising", "83:40", "you yeah yeah yeah", "83:41", "and then and then and then what he does", "83:44", "is he starts asking me a question", "83:46", "of some detailed question about the", "83:48", "geology and well if that's the case how", "83:50", "can such and such", "83:51", "and i think it in hindsight might have", "83:53", "been fed to him by some", "83:56", "geo-archaeologists as they call someone", "83:58", "who does archaeology but knows a little", "84:00", "geology", "84:01", "uh and i i realized in hindsight", "84:05", "it was meant to be one of those got you", "84:07", "questions i guess they say nowadays", "84:09", "where i wouldn't be able to answer it", "84:11", "but no i of course i thought about it it", "84:13", "was to me as a geologist very obvious so", "84:15", "i start", "84:16", "giving him this detailed explanation as", "84:18", "to why that's not the case and why", "84:20", "you know my evidence stands up blah blah", "84:22", "blah", "84:23", "and we're standing there face to face", "84:26", "i'm explaining this to him and i see his", "84:28", "face sort of turn and it goes", "84:30", "blank and i'm in mid-sentence he just", "84:32", "turns around and walks away", "84:35", "he doesn't realize he couldn't he", "84:37", "couldn't refute what you were saying no", "84:38", "he couldn't refute what i was saying and", "84:40", "he wasn't really", "84:41", "answer my takeaway is that he wasn't", "84:44", "interested in discussing it rationally", "84:47", "or", "84:47", "and you know he just wanted to um", "84:51", "win the debate or whatever and when he", "84:54", "knew that he wasn't going to with you", "84:56", "he just got out of there yeah yeah wow", "84:58", "and again you know it was a", "85:00", "just a personal thing there was no other", "85:01", "witnesses to my knowledge of this", "85:04", "but if he had really wanted to discuss", "85:06", "things i was willing to discuss it with", "85:08", "him", "85:10", "it's so disturbing that someone would", "85:12", "put their own ego", "85:14", "so far above the information that needs", "85:16", "to be

right", "92:01", "year by year and the best estimate is", "92:03", "about 9 700 bc", "92:05", "you know give take a decade okay so from", "92:08", "that", "92:09", "point to 2500 bc", "92:12", "which is where most conventional", "92:15", "egyptologists date the construction of", "92:18", "the the pyramid", "92:19", "you believe that the great pyramid was", "92:22", "probably built on top of this

then", "92:33", "thousands of years later were able to", "92:37", "somehow or another rebuild these yeah", "92:39", "thousands of years later", "92:41", "well i don't know if they were", "92:42",

have places where we", "93:03", "know that there were older structures", "93:05", "solomon's temple etc and maybe only a", "93:08", "fragment of it is left", "93:10", "but we it's still held in high

mean could just be", "93:32", "respect yes", "93:34", "uh so i think that for all three of the", "93:37", "major pyramids on the giza plateau", "93:40", "we have evidence that there was", "93:42",

i have enough", "94:36", "contacts okay i'll go with you", "94:38", "immediately yeah", "94:38", "okay we have to do that make something", "94:40", "happen yeah well definitely definitely i", "94:42",

how", "95:03", "long a history you're dealing with when", "95:06", "it comes to ancient egypt so", "95:08", "we're talking about thousands and", "95:10", "thousands of years", "95:11", "for sure and this is", "95:18", "just from cleopatra to the 2500 bc", "95:22", "which is what almost all the", "95:24", "egyptologists accept", "95:25", "you're dealing with just a giant leap", "95:29", "here's the we could see it here that's", "95:31", "right and and so", "95:32", "and we are closer to the dynastic", "95:36", "egyptians even the old kingdom dynastic", "95:39", "egyptians we are closer to them", "95:41", "in time than they were to the end of the", "95:42", "last ice age and the demise of that", "95:44", "earlier civilization", "95:46", "so this is a dynastic egyptian dynastic",

"96:44", "called research highlights actually i", "96:46", "think", "96:47", "for those on the podcast are seen here", "96:49", "and then go to what's called the siddha", "96:51", "article", "96:52",

"97:18", "rebuilding", "97:19", "civilization and rising back", "97:22", "up to some still unbelievably incredible", "97:25", "technological level", "97:26", "so even if they did rebuild the pyramid",

have to yeah", "97:47", "i could i would take you among other", "97:49", "things around the second pyramid", "97:51", "the second pyramid you can see evidence", "97:54", "i would point out to you",

"98:52", "look at it", "98:53", "to try to do build a great pyramid today", "98:57", "whether you're talking 2500 bc or", "99:00", "earlier", "99:01", "i mean how were they doing it how were",

have i thought", "99:14", "about it a lot", "99:15", "yes uh whether i'm there in egypt", "99:18", "on site or elsewhere i mean it's", "99:21", "incredible is it i don't have any answer", "99:23", "for you", "99:23", "is it possible that the people in that", "99:25", "part of the world somehow or another", "99:26", "survived", "99:28", "the coronal mass ejection in and they", "99:30", "came out", "99:31", "better than the people in other parts of", "99:33", "the world that were really knocked into", "99:34", "the stone age", "99:36", "no i don't think there's any evidence", "99:37", "for

in egypt", "99:50", "is incomparable one could argue", "99:53", "so it may well be that they", "99:56", "found all the right materials all the", "99:59", "right environments the", "100:00", "nile valley uh is you know", "100:04", "in its height which is not in its height", "100:06", "now", "100:07", "you know at the end of siddha let's say", "100:09", "for re-emergence", "100:12", "may have just been i hate to say the", "100:14", "goldilocks words but", "100:15", "just right for everything to come", "100:18", "together for", "100:19", "this to you know come together it's a", "100:22", "very fertile area it's very easily uh", "100:27", "defended that type of thing um and also", "100:31", "i do want to tie in with what you were", "100:33", "saying it is and i've certainly thought", "100:35", "about this", "100:35", "it is possible that uh we are electrical", "100:38", "and um the fluctuating electric fields", "100:41", "of magnetic fields did they have some", "100:43",

possible that they retain some of", "100:54", "the knowledge from thousands", "100:55", "oh i think they definitely retain so", "100:58", "just like we have monasteries in europe", "101:00", "during the dark ages retaining", "101:02", "knowledge and what's interesting is in", "101:04", "some cases you would retain", "101:06", "chunks of knowledge that don't even make", "101:08", "sense out of context", "101:10", "except that they know they're important", "101:12", "they know they're valuable", "101:14", "what kind of examples well i think in", "101:15", "europe where you would have", "101:18", "pieces of technology that would be", "101:21", "retained", "101:22", "but you don't have the whole complex or", "101:25", "think in literary terms that's probably", "101:26", "the easiest where you have", "101:28", "parts of like a history of alexander", "101:32", "where the whole thing did not survive", "101:34", "but you know", "101:36", "six out of nine chapters or whatever", "101:38", "survived and even though they knew it", "101:40", "was an incomplete manuscript", "101:42", "they would make numerous copies of that", "101:44", "incomplete manuscript knowing", "101:46", "that it was important sort of like the", "101:48", "difference", "101:49", "oh yeah there's another example although", "101:51", "the dead sea scrolls potentially were", "101:53", "absolutely complete or at least most of", "101:55", "them were complete when they were", "101:57", "buried and you know put away for storage", "102:01", "a lot of them the incomplete was there", "102:04", "may be because they degraded because", "102:06", "they were discovered by", "102:08", "you know locals who then tore them apart", "102:10", "and sold pieces here or there", "102:11", "i'm referring more to a situation where", "102:14", "you have ancient", "102:15", "knowledge or ancient manuscripts and", "102:17", "even though say the monks and monsters", "102:20", "knew that this was not a complete", "102:22", "manuscript", "102:23", "they knew that even in its", "102:25", "incompleteness it was important to", "102:27", "maintain as much of it as possible it's", "102:30", "just stunning that a civilization that", "102:32", "was knocked down", "102:33", "like every other civilization somehow or", "102:36", "another 2500 bc", "102:38", "rose to this incredible level of", "102:41",

"103:27", "incredible stuff", "103:28", "but i think we're starting to get more", "103:32", "toward an answer or at least getting the", "103:35", "broader outlines of what is going on", "103:39", "wow this is it's it's so fascinating to", "103:42", "think that this could potentially happen", "103:43", "to us", "103:44", "well that it's not only fascinating i", "103:47", "hate to use the term it's scary", "103:49", "and i think we're incredibly vulnerable", "103:51", "and people are not", "103:52", "addressing this yeah it's not the type", "103:54", "of thing to address", "103:56", "for some

learn", "105:33", "from this and one of the things to learn", "105:36", "is that they survived incredible", "105:39", "well i don't know if they survived but", "105:41", "they were knocked to their knees but", "105:42", "we they went through natural", "105:45", "catastrophes", "105:47", "which are not unrealistic that we could", "105:49", "go through them again", "105:51", "and be potentially much more vulnerable", "105:54", "than they are", "105:55", "than they were at that time because", "105:58", "we're so reliant on", "105:59", "birds yeah is there any are there any", "106:02",

well you said", "106:13", "convincing i would say no", "106:14", "no i would say no uh", "106:18", "and this gets into the problem too that", "106:20", "why would you expect that", "106:23", "i'm serious because what we have", "106:25", "surviving", "106:27", "are generally religious", "106:30", "somewhat literary um things in", "106:33", "tombs now i don't buy for a second that", "106:36",

never actually found bodies", "106:45", "in the great pyramid or any of the major", "106:46", "pyramids", "106:48", "and as you know i know you know this the", "106:50", "pyramid construction goes downhill", "106:53", "as you go into later dynastic egypt so", "106:56", "they seem to have either gotten sloppy", "106:58", "or just", "106:58", "lost some of the yeah technological", "107:01",

type", "107:33", "of thing", "107:34", "do you have any images of that uh well", "107:36", "not not that i brought with me", "107:38", "um but my point is that you wouldn't", "107:41", "even expect them to be", "107:44", "leaving detailed construction plans", "107:47", "uh or that we would necessarily find", "107:49", "them maybe we'll get lucky fine someday", "107:51", "but", "107:51", "put this way if they find a bunch of", "107:53", "iphones twelve thousand years from now", "107:55", "or five thousand years from now with", "107:57", "their", "107:57", "whichever period we want to find talk", "107:59", "about", "108:00", "will they know what they are and even if", "108:02", "they know what they are", "108:03", "will we will they find the plans of how", "108:06", "to build one and the factory", "108:07", "specifications of you know all the", "108:09", "engineering that goes into it", "108:11", "no so why would you expect it for", "108:15", "the great pyramid right but well you", "108:17", "know it'd be a lucky it'd be a lucky", "108:18", "find if you did", "108:19", "but how much money the odds are against", "108:21", "it and and", "108:23", "not to throw out too much academia type", "108:25", "stuff but one of the things i studied as", "108:27", "a graduate school is i took a series of", "108:29", "courses in tafonomy which is basically", "108:31", "how do things get preserved", "108:33", "focusy on fossils but it", "108:36", "the principles apply to other things as", "108:38", "well and as you go back in time", "108:41", "what you expect to survive", "108:43", "logarithmically drops off", "108:45", "you know so you go back to these earlier", "108:48", "periods it's amazing we have much of", "108:50", "anything", "108:51", "and what's going to survive big massive", "108:53", "stone", "108:54", "structures right not the plans on", "108:58", "papyrus or sheepskin or whatever of", "109:02", "right the details of how to build it", "109:04", "that's why what i found particularly", "109:05", "offensive about that", "109:07", "um egyptologist saying where's the", "109:09", "evidence of this culture from ten", "109:10", "thousand five hundred years ago", "109:12", "like what what do you expect to find", "109:14", "yeah exactly this is", "109:15", "we're talking about you know what we", "109:17", "find from that earlier period", "109:19", "if you think about are massive stone", "109:22", "monumental", "109:23", "structures yeah everything else would be", "109:25", "grounded it was incinerated it was", "109:27", "it was ground into dust or it was reused", "109:30", "in some cases sometimes people say well", "109:33", "they how could they do that without", "109:34", "metal tools", "109:35", "well maybe male allergy does go back", "109:38", "further maybe it was", "109:39", "lost and then reinvented again so again", "109:41", "i don't deny the standard time frame but", "109:44", "there could be a lot of things going", "109:45", "back", "109:45", "before that and if you have metal and", "109:48", "i'm not trying to focus on metal now and", "109:50", "i'm not", "109:51", "making any big claims about metallurgy", "109:53", "at earlier time", "109:54", "but let's just say for instance as a", "109:56", "thought experiment", "109:58", "if you had metallurgy much earlier than", "110:02", "conventional time frame says", "110:05", "and you had a natural catastrophe like", "110:08", "that", "110:08", "are they just going to leave their metal", "110:10", "tools all over the place", "110:12", "right no they'd collect all the scraps", "110:14", "of metal possible", "110:16", "and recycle and reuse and reuse we do", "110:19", "that to this day", "110:20", "right i mean people got in massachusetts", "110:23", "at least", "110:24", "if you have a warehouse and you're not", "110:27", "paying attention to it all the time it's", "110:28", "an old warehouse", "110:29", "there have been cases where people have", "110:31", "found someone broke in not to", "110:33", "steal the things in the warehouse but to", "110:35", "steal the copper piping", "110:36", "right yeah that's very common now", "110:39", "there's some of these more interesting", "110:42", "pieces of evidence", "110:43", "that came out of the great pyramid and a", "110:46", "lot of the other structures of egypt", "110:48", "have been the pottery that's incredibly", "110:50", "difficult to reproduce like those stone", "110:53", "yeah yeah well you just made a mistake", "110:55", "i'm not criticizing you i said pottery", "110:56", "you said padre because it's important", "110:58", "distinction right no it's not", "111:00", "gonna play fired in a kiln in front of a", "111:03", "car", "111:03", "it's literally carved out really hard", "111:06", "stone which will crack easily if you", "111:09", "don't do it just right so it looks like", "111:12", "pottery and that's", "111:13", "you use the term colloquially put that", "111:15", "way it looks like pottery", "111:17", "because that's how people imagine you", "111:19", "know it looks like a beautifully shaped", "111:21", "pot but", "111:22", "some of these they go and they go back", "111:24", "to the earliest dynastic", "111:26", "egypt and probably much earlier they are", "111:29", "carved out really hard granites and", "111:31", "schists and nice you know these really", "111:34", "hard stones and to incredible tolerances", "111:38", "and incredibly thin incredibly", "111:41", "beautifully carved and what's most", "111:44", "importantly too", "111:44", "very small opening very small exactly", "111:48", "and how do you do this i mean it's just", "111:51", "incredible", "111:52", "when you have to come to egypt with us", "111:54", "okay and when we do", "111:56", "we'll look at some of these on-site um", "111:59", "there's a bunch in the", "112:00", "car museum their summit uh museum at", "112:03", "sakara", "112:04", "where they uh that's not that's not even", "112:06", "a nice one", "112:07", "yeah that that's amazing looks like a", "112:09", "mace header or that's a jar but that's", "112:11", "not what we're talking about that's not", "112:13", "there's much much nicer um", "112:16", "uh i might nicer in the sense of the", "112:18", "finesse", "112:19", "of how it was the material that they", "112:21", "were carved out of the", "112:22", "marble they're different marbles the", "112:24", "easier ones to do", "112:25", "they would grab them out diorite granite", "112:28", "nice which is a metamorphic stone schist", "112:31", "these are", "112:32", "really hard stones how do you spell", "112:34", "diorite um", "112:37", "d-i-o-r-i-t-e i believe try that because", "112:40", "that's what", "112:40", "i'm pretty sure i saw one of them that", "112:41", "was carved out of that", "112:44", "and so so so what i was saying is that", "112:48", "these are really hard to carve they use", "112:49", "very narrow openings like", "112:51", "you said sometimes they put handles on", "112:53", "them so they're not just spinning them", "112:54", "on a lathe", "112:55", "because how would you get the handles on", "112:57", "it because that's not put on separately", "112:58", "it's all carved", "113:00", "from one look at that look at that", "113:01", "there's a nice one", "113:03", "uh that's why these stone vessels and", "113:05", "these", "113:06", "thousands of these have been found going", "113:08", "back to the earliest dynastic", "113:10", "times but what suggested yeah there's um", "113:14", "how they were carved according probably", "113:15", "to the standard egyptologist now try to", "113:18", "do that without cracking it without", "113:20", "making a mistake", "113:21", "etc oh we'll explain what we're looking", "113:24", "at we're looking at some sort of a it", "113:25", "looks like a", "113:27", "like a mace yeah that they would use to", "113:29", "then scratch out the inside", "113:31", "yeah too um and maybe they did it and", "113:34", "just took a long time", "113:35", "what's the speculation other than that", "113:37", "look at the one right above it jamie", "113:39", "that red one the red one right above", "113:40", "your cursor yeah that one's incredible", "113:42", "yeah they're they're absolutely", "113:43", "incredible and we can see these", "113:45", "on site so what what's the speculation", "113:48", "uh the the speculation", "113:53", "is that they were doing it the same way", "113:54", "they were doing in new kingdom times", "113:57", "so when you look at them in new kingdom", "113:59", "times as a general rule", "114:01", "you get things similar to this new", "114:03", "kingdoms let's say 1500 bc just for", "114:06", "round numbers", "114:07", "you get similar types of vases and", "114:09", "whatnot but they're", "114:10", "actually to my eye much cruder generally", "114:15", "they're made out of softer stone more", "114:17", "your calcites and limestones and marbles", "114:20", "that type of thing", "114:21", "they generally are just not they don't", "114:23", "have the same artistic finesse to them", "114:25", "the same perfection to them", "114:27", "and the new kingdom egyptians did show", "114:29", "diagrams as we just saw of how they did", "114:31", "it", "114:32", "or supposedly did it and that may well", "114:34", "be how they were doing it but i question", "114:36", "as a geologist whether", "114:38", "that would really work for these", "114:40", "beautiful", "114:41", "harder stone much more perfect in my", "114:45", "assessment older ones that you find", "114:48", "going back to the earliest dynasties and", "114:51", "you find in some cases", "114:52", "thousands of them so at sikara at the", "114:54", "step pyramid", "114:56", "generally considered the oldest pyramid", "114:58", "although i would question that", "114:59", "but it's definitely an old pyramid even", "115:02", "by egyptological standards", "115:04", "you found thousands of these really well", "115:07", "carved ones from the harder stone the", "115:10", "more", "115:11", "artistic ones if we could call it that", "115:13", "sort of a", "115:14", "huge hoard of them i don't even think", "115:17", "they were necessarily carved at that", "115:18", "time i think this may have been a horde", "115:21", "that they had preserved from thousands", "115:23", "of years earlier", "115:24", "sort of a stockpile or museum if you", "115:26", "would in fact what we're finding for", "115:28", "many of these quote tombs and temples", "115:31", "not temples tombs and pyramids that type", "115:33", "of thing is that maybe essentially they", "115:35", "were stockpiles they were", "115:37", "the equivalent of you know fallout", "115:39", "shelters if you would", "115:40", "were you stockaway supplies that type of", "115:43", "thing that may have been", "115:44", "part of the original structure uh", "115:47", "some of these had very long necks too", "115:49", "very very long bulbous bottoms", "115:51", "exactly insanely difficult like the ones", "115:53", "that are totally good but there's ones", "115:55", "yeah some of them are extremely", "115:56", "difficult some they have all kinds of", "115:58", "curves", "115:59", "and what you have to be careful as i was", "116:00", "saying is that you have the", "116:02", "really well finessed very ancient ones", "116:05", "and then you have ancient ones that are", "116:08", "from the new came to only three thousand", "116:10", "three thousand five hundred years old", "116:12", "yeah yeah uh and then what you have and", "116:15", "i could show you one", "116:16", "and if it's still on display in the", "116:17", "egyptian museum i say still on display", "116:19", "because", "116:20", "they changed displays and they're", "116:22", "building a new grand egyptian museum as", "116:24", "they call it so it's hard this is in", "116:26", "egypt", "116:26", "yeah in egypt when we go to egypt okay", "116:29", "now", "116:29", "oh but like i was going to say i can", "116:31", "show you one where i'm convinced that", "116:33", "it's a", "116:34", "very old bull that was then reused", "116:37", "in later times so you see this", "116:41", "cruder hieroglyphic inscription on it", "116:44", "and you just look at it and you say", "116:46", "someone that could carve that incredible", "116:48", "ball", "116:49", "would not have done such a crude", "116:51", "inscription on it you see what i mean so", "116:53", "and then when we go through each with", "116:56", "the megalithic", "116:57", "statues and whatnot you can find over", "116:59", "and over", "117:00", "where they would carve on them later so", "117:03", "reappropriate them", "117:05", "in later dynastic times which is still", "117:08", "thousands of years ago", "117:09", "so very ancient from our personal", "117:11", "perspective but they were", "117:13", "reusing older structures wow", "117:16", "and older older artifacts", "117:20", "this the whole subject is so fascinating", "117:22", "to me but this", "117:23", "bowl thing is very weird because it's", "117:25", "almost like one of the", "117:26", "crazier pieces of evidence but it's", "117:28", "dismissed like oh yeah it's like right", "117:30", "under your nose", "117:30", "oh it's absolutely dismissed and it's", "117:32", "it's not unlike", "117:34", "and i only think of this because i know", "117:35", "you saw it if you remember", "117:37", "when you because i watched the recently", "117:40", "to refresh my memory the podcast where", "117:41", "you", "117:42", "interviewed john anthony west and he", "117:44", "showed a picture which happened to be my", "117:46", "hand", "117:47", "but in my hand was a little bead that", "117:50", "was found at quebec", "117:51", "tape and the thing is remember that", "117:53", "little bee had this it was a very hard", "117:56", "um probably volcanic stone and", "117:59", "a little teeny hole drilled all the way", "118:02", "through it the long way so you had", "118:04", "a drilling that's you know a centimeter", "118:06", "or more long", "118:07", "going through it's not just a little", "118:09", "hole punch through but a little tunnel", "118:11", "going through there it is", "118:12", "yeah um and you know", "118:16", "how do you do that with quote primitive", "118:19", "technology", "118:20", "that to me is as amazing as direction of", "118:22", "the pillars", "118:23", "wow you know so you have to look at both", "118:26", "small scale and large scale and like you", "118:27", "say the bulls may be something you hold", "118:29", "in your hand but yeah", "118:30", "they're just as incredible technology", "118:32", "just like if people", "118:34", "were to judge us today ten thousand", "118:37", "years from now", "118:38", "they'd say that iphone is incredible", "118:41", "technology", "118:41", "even this small scale just like i guess", "118:44", "they would maybe say", "118:45", "if anything survives of them uh some", "118:48", "high-rise was a", "118:49", "incredible and this is gabeckley tepe is", "118:51", "that what you just pulled up

earplugs some", "119:01", "people", "119:02", "claim that no one really knows exactly", "119:03", "what they are earplugs", "119:05", "yeah well you know now not ear plugs and", "119:08", "plug your ears oh like", "119:11", "yeah earrings i don't know exactly what", "119:15", "that could be", "119:15", "supposed to be yeah they call them", "119:16", "buttons there sometimes what is the",

but the problem is you can't", "119:38", "turn it", "119:39", "and still have the handle sticking right", "119:41", "if you do standard", "119:42", "work on you know spinning lathe that", "119:45",

do certain technological things", "120:04", "and i think that may go back to very", "120:07", "very ancient times but you don't", "120:09", "want to just give out right you know the", "120:12",

things that", "120:23", "they found in the king's chamber was", "120:25", "what they referred to as did they call", "120:27", "it a sarcophagus like", "120:28", "yeah they call it a sarcophagus i prefer", "120:30", "the term coffer", "120:32", "and it's made out of granite as one", "120:34", "granite coffer meaning like almost like", "120:36", "a treasure chest yeah a treasure chest",

don't think that's correct", "120:45", "no correct that's why i don't like", "120:47", "calling it", "120:47", "sarcophagus coffer is more generic", "120:50", "should we say", "120:51", "right and doesn't the king's chamber has", "120:54", "some of the more complicated stones", "120:55", "right larger oh it has it's lined with", "120:58", "granite", "120:59", "so the the primary construction", "121:02", "material of", "121:06", "the primary construction material for", "121:08", "the great pyramid", "121:11", "is limestone right some of the limestone", "121:14", "was quarried", "121:14",

nile", "121:24", "and you can still see the turret", "121:26", "limestone quarries", "121:28", "and then granite was used for parts of", "121:31", "the construction", "121:33", "particularly to line the king's chamber", "121:35", "and this granite was brought from", "121:37", "southern egypt brought up brought down", "121:40", "the nile i should say", "121:41", "from the south to the north of now flows", "121:43", "from the south to the north", "121:45", "and it's aswan grant and you're talking", "121:47", "about huge blocks of stone up to 90 tons", "121:50", "or so have been the estimates",

in and a lot of people have", "122:11", "you know all kinds of experiences", "122:13", "etc it's just really incredible but it", "122:16", "is these this lining is so", "122:20", "perfect and so well fit together", "122:23", "and you have this uh you know all the", "122:27", "sides the roof", "122:28", "the ceiling of the roof the our ceiling", "122:31", "of it um the walls of it the floor of it", "122:34", "the coffer", "122:35", "there and then you have what they know", "122:38", "called star shafts or air shafts that go", "122:41", "out", "122:41", "to the north and south that's what", "122:43", "robert baval has worked on in part", "122:45", "and then above the king's chamber you", "122:47", "have the so-called relief chambers or", "122:49", "relieving chambers", "122:50", "which you can't get into normally i've", "122:52", "been in there a few times", "122:54", "but you have to get special permission", "122:55", "they have to put a ladder up from the", "122:57", "grand gallery and you go through this", "122:59", "little", "123:00", "snake hole so to speak to get up there", "123:03", "but there's these chambers above it", "123:05", "which seem to serve", "123:06", "no function that's why they're called", "123:08", "relief chambers or relieving chambers", "123:10", "because", "123:11", "there was early speculation that somehow", "123:13", "they helped distribute the weight", "123:15", "of the great pyramid but engineering", "123:17", "from an engineering point of view they", "123:19", "don't seem to work", "123:20", "or it doesn't seem to make any", "123:21",

"it's called the king chamber basically", "123:31", "the arabs called it that because", "123:33", "their concept was if i remember", "123:35", "correctly", "123:36", "that men would have a chamber with a", "123:39", "flat", "123:40", "ceiling on it the queen's chamber which", "123:42", "is lowered down in the", "123:43", "um uh pyramid has uh", "123:47", "inverted v shaped chain uh ceiling to it", "123:51", "and they thought that was for the queen", "123:53", "that would be female the", "123:55", "king's chamber would be for the male", "123:56", "it's also the more impressive chamber", "123:58", "right but it's absolutely speculation oh", "124:00", "it's purely speculation yeah it's purely", "124:02", "speculation now the coffer", "124:04", "this uh giant stone box one things that", "124:06", "i read was that", "124:07", "the way it was built that they believed", "124:11", "that", "124:11", "it was possible that cores were drilled", "124:14", "out yeah yeah", "124:15", "probably the corn and we have good", "124:17", "evidence for that going back to earliest", "124:19", "dynastic times if not earlier", "124:22", "that they um i forget what you called in", "124:25", "modern times but", "124:26", "uh you have a drill bit that is circular", "124:30", "in shape and it drills out a core", "124:32", "so you know they were drilling granite", "124:35", "you", "124:36", "again if it's still on display i could", "124:37", "show you in the um egyptian museum in", "124:40", "cairo", "124:41", "sarcophagi which probably really were", "124:44", "sarcophagi are these big granite", "124:46", "boxes where they were sawing the granite", "124:49", "in fact not only were they sawing it", "124:51", "looks like they were using", "124:52", "high-speed saws because in some cases", "124:54", "they would make a little mistake and", "124:55", "then have to back off", "124:57", "and then go at it again you don't do", "125:00", "that if you're", "125:01", "in my opinion if you're doing it by hand", "125:03", "you know back and forth with right", "125:06", "so i think there's some sort of", "125:08", "machinery involved there's some kind of", "125:10", "machining they were using", "125:12", "in very ancient times there's once you", "125:14", "open your eyes to it", "125:16", "you see it where you see it seems to be", "125:19", "high-speed", "125:20", "machinery but there's no speculation as", "125:22", "to how oh there's lots of speculation i", "125:25", "mean some people say they had electric", "125:26", "motors and electricity", "125:28", "and all that type of thing like i say", "125:30", "some people though yeah some people i", "125:31", "don't go there because i want real", "125:33", "evidence", "125:34", "right so i see real evidence that they", "125:36", "were doing things", "125:38", "that seem really unbelievable", "125:42", "from a standard status quo conventional", "125:45", "point of view say that", "125:47", "standard egyptological point of view of", "125:49", "how quote how primitive they were", "125:51", "right but i'm not into speculating", "125:54", "inordinately as to", "125:56", "well what kind of technology they might", "125:58", "have had i just don't know at this point", "126:00", "yeah so is there images of the the", "126:02", "inside of the sarcophagus like we could", "126:04", "get a look at what that looks like oh it", "126:06", "sounds very impressive i'm sure", "126:08", "he could probably i don't know if you", "126:09", "can see the drill marks", "126:11", "usually no um but", "126:14", "you know they're there you can see other", "126:17", "places", "126:18", "so for instance uh when we go into the", "126:21", "uh valley temple next to it there's one", "126:24", "of the", "126:25", "doors that was on huge hinges and i", "126:28", "don't think you're going to find", "126:29", "pictures of this on the internet because", "126:30", "it's very", "126:31", "hard to photograph but when you look at", "126:34", "that", "126:34", "in person you can see how they drilled", "126:36", "out", "126:37", "you know the hinge several several", "126:41", "inches in diameter and did a core drill", "126:43", "because you can still see", "126:45", "if i remember there you can still see", "126:46", "the sort of the stub where it broke off", "126:49", "oh wow yeah you can see how they were", "126:51", "using", "126:52", "sophisticated techniques to do this but", "126:54", "no", "126:55", "idea whatsoever about i don't know what", "126:57", "can", "126:58", "well put this way if we and this is i'm", "127:01", "not speculating that they had such", "127:03", "things but", "127:04", "you can tell in modern times that", "127:07", "someone used a power", "127:08", "saw or a power drill or this type of", "127:10", "tool or that type of tool", "127:12", "thousands of years from now you might be", "127:13", "able to still see", "127:15", "that like this table yeah and like being", "127:17", "interpreted", "127:18", "but you don't have a single example of", "127:20", "the tool that was actually used for it", "127:22", "right right you know i mean these guys i", "127:25", "sometimes", "127:25", "almost find it silly when people say", "127:28", "well", "127:29", "oh here we go how could oh yeah there", "127:31", "that's a nice", "127:32", "example of it okay there we go that's a", "127:34", "good example yeah that's actually", "127:36", "probably the one i was just talking", "127:37", "about", "127:38", "oh this is a borehole yeah and you can", "127:42", "see", "127:42", "the uh how it's spinning you can see how", "127:45", "they were cutting down", "127:46", "quite a bit in each turn wow so so so i", "127:49", "almost find it", "127:50", "i don't almost find i do find it silly", "127:52", "sometimes when people", "127:54", "say to me the critics the skeptics oh", "127:56", "you know if they were doing all this", "127:57", "stuff well where's", "127:58", "examples of their tools well i mean how", "128:02", "many guys just leave", "128:03", "you know they walk away from a site and", "128:05", "they leave their bach", "128:06", "tool box there you know or even or", "128:09", "forget i mean", "128:10", "all the all the mechanics i've ever", "128:13", "known and people like that", "128:15", "they're very careful to pick up every", "128:17", "tool and put it back and make sure", "128:19", "they've got all their equipment we'll go", "128:20", "to the embassy building and try", "128:22", "to find a hammer yeah yeah exactly yeah", "128:25", "no that completely makes sense but man", "128:29", "i would just like to know like what were", "128:31", "they doing like how did they make that", "128:32", "hole", "128:33", "that's that's a massive massive mystery", "128:36", "right in front of everyone's face", "128:37", "yeah yeah exactly what's the standard", "128:40", "egyptologist explanation", "128:45", "there's really one thing they don't", "128:46", "really have one they just", "128:48", "shrug their shoulders oh we see that all", "128:50", "the time well great you see it all the", "128:51", "time but", "128:52", "it it reminds me of um this is maybe", "128:55", "silly but i'm going to say it anyway", "128:57", "uh no i don't know well i'll say it", "129:00", "anyway uh", "129:00", "the supposedly uh analogy", "129:04", "you know if you", "129:07", "if you're used to something i'll put it", "129:08", "this way if you're used to seeing", "129:10", "something on a regular basis you start", "129:12", "you stop questioning it just becomes um", "129:18", "common yeah to you but you don't really", "129:20", "question it it's like", "129:21", "technology today how many people could", "129:23", "explain how even the most rumored sense", "129:26", "how some of the", "129:27", "technology works that we have today the", "129:30", "egyptologists seem to", "129:32", "they just get immune to it they see all", "129:34", "this fabulous stuff and they just forget", "129:36", "that well this was made somehow we don't", "129:38", "really know how it was made", "129:40", "then they again go back to the", "129:43", "simplistic explanations of oh you know", "129:46", "in some new kingdom or late period", "129:48", "we have this illustration this must be", "129:51", "how they did", "129:52", "it and i'm not convinced that that's", "129:54", "always how they did it what is the", "129:55", "illustration it's", "129:56", "almost just like a little cartoon right", "129:58", "did they have any illustrations oh yeah", "129:59", "remember", "130:00", "where they they would have a drill and", "130:02", "some stones around it as a", "130:05", "weights to keep it spinning no i haven't", "130:07", "seen that", "130:08", "uh maybe i have yeah you might have had", "130:11", "yeah yeah", "130:12", "i mean so you think that's just purely", "130:13", "speculation yeah or it could be sort of", "130:16", "the equivalent of modern cartoons of", "130:20", "uh you know simple explanations of how", "130:22", "something works", "130:23", "and a lot of that is really more to say", "130:26", "okay", "130:27", "if you're a watchmaker i mean say 200", "130:30", "years ago you're a watchmaker you might", "130:31", "have some", "130:32", "sign that indicates you're a watchmaker", "130:35", "but don't try to take that sign as a", "130:36", "blueprint of how you actually made", "130:38", "watches", "130:39", "right right no it does it does", "130:43", "um i so the", "130:46", "when they constructed that coffer they", "130:49", "somehow or another", "130:50", "board yeah they probably bored down", "130:52", "maybe bored in the corners bored down", "130:54", "broke out pieces this is speculation now", "130:57", "and broke it out and then once you've", "130:58", "got it", "131:00", "roughed out right then polish the", "131:02", "surfaces", "131:03", "that type of thing um so", "131:06", "you know if you leave any traces of how", "131:09", "it was actually constructed", "131:11", "that's not as good as if there are no", "131:14", "traces more or less", "131:15", "you know it's not as good a job you look", "131:17", "at something like the statue of kafra", "131:20", "or chef ron this credible statue in", "131:24", "the um egyptian museum again it's the", "131:27", "one that was", "131:27", "has the face of the pharaoh that", "131:30", "supposedly was the face of the sphinx", "131:32", "which they don't match up at all there's", "131:33", "the hawk on his shoulders", "131:35", "on his shoulders uh that statue is", "131:38", "absolutely incredible you you know it's", "131:41", "so", "131:41", "smoothly polished etc you have to look", "131:44", "very hard to find any tool marks or", "131:47", "evidence of how", "131:48", "it was carved because you know really", "131:50", "good workmanship you", "131:53", "remove all that right ultimately", "131:56", "so that's part of the problem with some", "131:59", "of this", "132:00", "really high quality egyptian work is", "132:02", "that they would", "132:04", "remove the traces yeah there it is um", "132:07", "you they would remove the traces of uh", "132:11", "how it was made and in that image", "132:14", "on the side of it you see that sort of", "132:16", "plasma formation yes", "132:18", "absolutely because this ties in this is", "132:20", "why", "132:21", "i brought image of this because it ties", "132:23", "in with that", "132:25", "whole um and it has the scenario as well", "132:29", "and has the circle say well exactly very", "132:31", "observant and", "132:32", "think about the bird-headed man the hawk", "132:34", "hmm", "132:35", "you know right and this incredible", "132:37", "statue if you", "132:39", "view it face on you don't see the bird", "132:42", "from the side you see the bird god it's", "132:45", "incredible", "132:46", "all this stuff is so fascinating so i", "132:48", "think it really all goes back", "132:50", "to this very early formative period if", "132:54", "you would this", "132:55", "really important period for humanity and", "132:58", "what was happening there's a", "133:00", "head-on view and there you don't see the", "133:02", "bird at all of course", "133:04", "but incredible and i mean carve", "133:06", "something like that today", "133:08", "i don't know what it would cost who you", "133:10", "could pay", "133:12", "i've heard you know this is anecdotal", "133:15", "i've talked to", "133:15", "stone cutters and that type of thing and", "133:18", "you know", "133:20", "to try to duplicate some of what they", "133:22", "see in", "133:23", "egypt i mean it just would take them so", "133:26", "long", "133:26", "and so much work and it would be", "133:30", "so expensive with modern power tools", "133:33", "that they basically say you know who", "133:35", "could do it do you have any fear that", "133:37", "this is gonna this information is gonna", "133:38", "be lost", "133:40", "i mean that you're so far down this", "133:42", "track of sort of explaining these things", "133:45", "and these revolutionary", "133:47", "theories about what happened and i don't", "133:50", "this is a i mean i've been studying this", "133:52", "for a long time and this is the first", "133:54", "time i'm hearing it", "133:56", "so that's why you need to be on your", "133:57", "show definitely i'm so glad you're here", "134:00", "to get the sound to the public yeah", "134:01", "you're so far down this road", "134:03", "is there anyone else that's doing the", "134:05", "same kind of work is anybody else's with", "134:07", "you on this", "134:08", "well i think i'm the one that's doing", "134:10", "this right now but i think there are a", "134:12",

underneath is", "161:46", "sacrilegious to you know what their main", "161:48", "interest is", "161:49", "you know so it gets very very", "161:51", "complicated i bet phd's", "161:53", "in egypt uh one in particular just to", "161:56", "tell you a quick anecdote", "161:58", "i'm seeing there having breakfast this", "161:59", "was in the 1990s", "162:01", "and it was in a hotel where it's",

to", "164:51", "in egypt egyptians", "164:54", "who take that perspective now others", "164:56", "will say we have to save all these", "164:58", "but not necessarily because they could", "165:00",

because i've had egyptians say to me", "165:22", "in no uncertain terms and", "165:26", "not joking or anything but point out", "165:28", "that depending on how you count it you", "165:30", "know 25",
