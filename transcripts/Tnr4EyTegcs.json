me", "09:45", "that is aware that that is a bottle so", "09:48", "that's a that's a higher level and that", "09:51", "is what appears to be unique to the", "09:53", "human mind the ability to

is doing that because it had", "11:32", "some intention but the fact is if we", "11:35", "start taking these things apart in the", "11:37", "brain we see that the systems that", "11:40", "control very simple behaviors or not the", "11:43", "ones that are doing all this high-level", "11:45", "conscious thought take the example of", "11:48", "the area I work on for all these years", "11:50", "which

just it just", "13:19", "became the amygdala", "13:20", "the brains fear center even the side", "13:22", "just ignored it because you know we were", "13:24", "studying and you know I kind of gave up",

way the drugs are discovered is", "14:39", "that take a rat or a mouse put in a", "14:42", "challenging situation", "14:43", "give it some different medications and", "14:46", "the ones that make the

separate", "16:40", "process it's the awareness that that", "16:43", "stuff is happening to you the awareness", "16:46", "of that stuff is happening to you so it", "16:49", "said no self no fear oh that's my", "16:51", "t-shirt yo that's my merch on the book", "16:54", "now how do things like xanax work what", "17:00", "what's the mechanical process okay so", "17:03", "the that's a part of the

"17:40", "the kind of simple reason why those", "17:43", "things can help is they kind of in here", "17:46", "that so they toned down the brain a bit", "17:49", "and so things that would normally", "17:51", "trigger a response no longer trigger it", "17:53", "so it's like increasing the threshold", "17:56", "for something to bother you in a sense", "17:58", "and a lot of people enjoy that with",

tell", "18:09", "people don't have sex yeah because you", "18:11", "can you know if you take a lot of sin x", "18:13", "and drink a lot of booze you can OD or", "18:16", "you could just say crazy

you", "29:17", "anxious about what's going to happen and", "29:18", "then there's general existential angst", "29:21", "mm-hmm just the life itself existence is", "29:26", "that just what is it what

the source", "39:31", "of creativity like somewhere along the", "39:34", "line I mean and we've seen it right I", "39:36", "mean there's some speculation and", "39:38", "scientists have sort of

I", "48:51", "have researched it a bit after I try to", "48:55", "do meditation myself because I think", "48:57", "it's the probably the most direct and", "49:00", "effective way in the moment to

know the best in the best", "51:46", "medications and the best CBT trials will", "51:49", "give you like 75 percent record of help", "51:53", "in a group that's pretty great though", "51:55", "isn't it you still got 25 that's but", "51:58", "yeah but you also have to extract out", "52:00", "the placebo effect mm-hmm and in many of", "52:03", "these drug studies for example", "52:05", "depressive

behavioral therapy there's I", "52:17", "mean you're actually going for the", "52:19", "placebo effect right I mean you're", "52:21", "trying to nothing wrong with let's say", "52:22", "perfect in

doing you're trying to enact change", "52:34", "right and if that changes enacted", "52:36", "there's not a pill involved right so it", "52:38", "is kind of like the same mechanism", "52:40", "that's involved in a placebo effect your", "52:44", "mind is creating this new change yes and", "52:48", "so but the question is a person that", "52:52", "goes through the motions but doesn't get", "52:54", "the therapy right how much are they", "52:56", "changed by simply by kind of going", "52:59", "through it there's so many variations", "53:01", "with humans or I'd like to find out like", "53:03",

"amazing yeah you consider if you have a", "53:15", "group of people what are the odds if you", "53:18", "have a group of a hundred people what", "53:19", "are the odds of twenty-five of them are", "53:20", "gonna be lazy pretty good right yeah", "53:23", "pretty I mean I would bet a ton of money", "53:26", "that twenty-five percent of those people", "53:28", "don't do what they're supposed to do all", "53:31", "the time right so you know you're right", "53:35", "but I think the the issue is from the", "53:38", "scientific point of view we need to know", "53:40", "exactly what really works what's", "53:44", "different from placebo right so that we", "53:46", "can see what to build for medication for", "53:50", "medication for cognitive therapy as well", "53:52", "but the therapy thing is so strange to", "53:54", "me because you put okay maybe we're", "53:56", "using the wrong word with placebo", "53:58", "because placebo is a word for a", "54:01", "medication that has a psychosomatic", "54:03", "effect right well it's it's the control", "54:06", "group that doesn't get the treatment", "54:08", "that you get that it's not really doing", "54:10", "anything physiologically but your body", "54:12", "is interpreting it as medicine and", "54:14", "saying alright change is coming and then", "54:16", "the change comes and that is a real", "54:18", "thing but when you're thinking about", "54:20", "cognitive behavioral therapy you're", "54:22", "thinking about using techniques and", "54:24", "strategies to change the way you think", "54:26", "and behave though so the concept of the", "54:30", "placebo effect doesn't really apply", "54:31", "there well you have to have a control", "54:33", "group right in the study you have to", "54:35", "have randomized control in order to make", "54:36", "it so when you have cognitive behavioral", "54:38", "therapy and you have randomized control", "54:40", "and you have a control group do you just", "54:42", "give them shitty therapy we need to get", "54:47", "a therapist on here to give you that to", "54:49", "that cuz I don't know the answer you", "54:50", "gone to therapy yourself I have yeah did", "54:52", "you do that to examine this I you know I", "54:55", "mainly went into it with for the", "54:58", "meditation port hmm to try and calm some", "55:02", "of my you know restlessness has writing", "55:06", "and all this study that you had to do to", "55:09", "write these books has that enhanced you", "55:11", "I mean that you have much more of an", "55:13", "understanding about what's

think", "55:28", "by writing those books I learn a lot and", "55:31", "it helps me see things and that doesn't", "55:33", "necessarily help me lead my life any", "55:35", "better but it I think I

see some guy who seems to be", "64:47", "following you yeah yep so now you're", "64:50", "you're in a situation where you're in a", "64:54", "potentially dangerous situation so now", "64:56", "you're

fear is that fear now you've", "65:14", "got a specific threat and yeah so you", "65:16", "now you're into fear and then that's", "65:17", "gonna morph into another anxiety about", "65:19", "what the hell is this guy gonna do to me", "65:21", "right so but all of that Malloy is gonna", "65:28", "go into your brain and trigger your", "65:30", "muscle tension your heart to race and so", "65:32",

we", "65:50", "understand that it becomes I think a", "65:52", "much easier problem how to approach", "65:54", "problems of fear and anxiety you've got", "65:56", "to separately treat the behavior in

phobic", "66:32", "of what spider phobic or snake phobia", "66:35", "oh so you would do exposure therapy", "66:38", "subliminally that means you're", "66:40", "imminently present the picture of a", "66:42", "snake or the spider so fast the", "66:46", "conscious mind doesn't know it's there", "66:47", "so like those old hungry eat popcorn", "66:49", "things exactly and that's a very common", "66:52", "technique in psychology so they would", "66:54", "show you a film and there'd be at one or", "66:56", "two frames of a spider if you had a wrap", "66:57", "or just a picture you know art but could", "66:59", "be a film yeah okay and but it would", "67:03", "have to go very fast in the film so they", "67:05", "would so with a picture you just present", "67:07", "it really quickly and because you know", "67:11", "normally if you show a spider phobic try", "67:14", "to do expose your therapy they don't", "67:16", "want to do it because they don't want to", "67:17", "deal with spiders but they they they're", "67:20", "conscious mind doesn't know what's", "67:21", "happening because it's going through", "67:22", "subliminally so the amygdala is being", "67:25", "tamed by the exposure and now they can", "67:30", "look at the picture without you know the", "67:33", "body reacting they're not jumping", "67:35", "they're not their heart isn't racing", "67:37", "because the amygdala has been turned off", "67:39", "so all those body responsive have calmed", "67:41", "down so now the person can kind of go", "67:44", "some undergo some cognitive change about", "67:46", "looking at spiders and so forth and then", "67:49", "finally once you've done those two steps", "67:51", "the brains ready for talk therapy and", "67:54", "meditation and other kinds of", "67:57", "mindfulness approaches because all of", "67:59", "the the impediments to all that have", "68:02", "been put aside by these first two steps", "68:04", "so as anybody ever like officially cured", "68:08", "someone of arachnophobia or video field", "68:11", "video phobia or you know fear of snakes", "68:13", "or spiders like those are those seem to", "68:14", "be almost like deep-seated genetic fears", "68:17", "well that we right now our ancestors yes", "68:21", "had a snake and but they very right", "68:24", "which is what's weird that means they're", "68:25", "certainly experienced venomous snakes", "68:28", "and but there's something about some", "68:31", "people have almost illogical reaction to", "68:35", "it that it's often been speculated that", "68:37", "this is some sort of a genetic memory of", "68:39", "someone perhaps", "68:41", "in their ancestry lines surviving a", "68:43", "snake attack or losing someone to a", "68:45", "snake it's more you know turns out that", "68:48", "the it's more about the ability to", "68:50", "rapidly learn about those kinds of", "68:53", "dangers than to innately respond mmm so", "68:58", "there seems to be it's called prepared", "68:59", "learning so you have an evolutionarily", "69:02", "based thing that's with you that", "69:05", "everyone has some version of but you", "69:07", "know varies from individual to", "69:08", "individual and then some people are", "69:12", "prone to rapidly learn that either", "69:17", "because of other experiences or because", "69:19", "of their particular genetic makeup and", "69:21", "so they tend to go down the road of", "69:24", "acquiring these kinds of phobias now so", "69:28", "it's the problem with treating that by", "69:31", "just extinguishing it through exposure", "69:34", "is that the extinction is always", "69:37", "impermanent you know if you once you've", "69:40", "been reduced nothing is wrong this is", "69:43", "true in a rat or person let's say the", "69:45", "rat has been given a tone that's been", "69:48", "paired with a shot and then it hears the", "69:50", "tone 20 or 30 times stops responding but", "69:54", "then if it goes back in the the room of", "69:56", "the chamber where the shock had occurred", "69:58", "the tone will again bring it elicit it", "70:02", "and the spyder phobic returns to the", "70:04", "place where he or she was bitten by a", "70:07", "spider or a place where spiders it was", "70:09", "supposed to be present it can come back", "70:10", "so these are imperfect temporary", "70:13", "solutions they're not enough and that's", "70:18", "why I mean they're called these are", "70:20", "called", "70:20", "you know reinstatement and things like", "70:23", "that because they pop back up so maybe", "70:27",

so", "70:38", "in terms of changing the mental state", "70:40", "because you know how could you possibly", "70:42", "design a medication that would know how", "70:44", "to change the content of a mental state", "70:47", "I mean that seems like an impossible yes", "70:50", "and that's what you want to do you don't", "70:51", "want to change all mental states right", "70:53", "you want to change the one", "70:54", "content you know I'm afraid of spiders", "70:57", "yeah uh it's it's so fascinating though", "71:03", "how people vary so widely in their their", "71:08", "reaction to certain fears or to certain", "71:10", "things that could induce fear whether", "71:13", "it's dogs or you know whatever", "71:15", "irrational thing that people have the", "71:18", "the source of that is really often", "71:22", "speculated that there's like some sort", "71:25", "of a genetic component to it do you buy", "71:26", "into that so let's say let's say that", "71:31", "you know in any kind of situation like", "71:33", "that there are multiple systems in the", "71:35", "brain that are going to be involved", "71:36", "we're gonna isolate the amygdala as you", "71:39", "know hypothetical part of that system", "71:42", "that is detecting and responding to the", "71:45", "stimulus so we're gonna go into the", "71:47", "amygdala and focus on one little part of", "71:51", "it called the lateral nucleus that", "71:53", "doesn't matter but it's the part that", "71:54", "gets the input from the outside world so", "71:58", "that is the gateway into the amygdala so", "72:01", "now let's talk about let's say it's got", "72:04", "100,000 cells and neurons and each of", "72:10", "those neurons is going to have a bell", "72:13", "curve that's based on the genes that", "72:18", "made that cell and whatever kinds of", "72:21", "electrical signals it's had throughout", "72:23", "the life of the organism so you can have", "72:27", "a hundred thousand bell curves you know", "72:29", "various degrees that when the stimulus", "72:32", "comes in those cells that that are", "72:35", "activated their little bell curves are", "72:37", "going to determine how much they respond", "72:39", "to that and that's going to propagate to", "72:42", "other cells that have their own bell", "72:43", "curves in areas and so on down the line", "72:46", "that what happens at the level of", "72:51", "behavior is a very complicated kind of", "72:54", "summation of all those bell curves of", "72:57", "all those cells that happen to be", "72:59", "activated so it's not like you know one", "73:02", "thing is progress it's not like a brain", "73:03", "areas program it's all about what's", "73:05", "happened at those specific cells both", "73:08", "through genetics and experience so we", "73:10", "often kind of oversimplify things by", "73:12", "thinking well there's a gene or an area", "73:15", "that has inherited that thing when you", "73:19", "think of human beings and you think of", "73:21", "what we used to be when we're some sort", "73:23", "of a lower hominid and now what we are", "73:25", "now and you think of all these various", "73:28", "components that are at play do you do", "73:31", "you ever try to imagine what a human of", "73:34", "a thousand years or ten thousand a", "73:36", "hundred thousand years from now will be", "73:37", "like well they're they're gonna be", "73:40", "different you know that we're not every", "73:43", "organism is in constant change", "73:45", "you know the racial mixing interbreeding", "73:50", "happens and so in the mutation random", "73:55", "mutations we're living longer and so you", "73:59", "know that's creating meat people are", "74:01", "having babies later that will change a", "74:04", "lot of stuff so we're gonna be a", "74:06", "different thing at some point we may", "74:08", "split out into a whole new kind of human", "74:11", "the the thing about people having babies", "74:14", "older I mean there's certainly physical", "74:17", "limitations when people start having", "74:20", "babies older but on the plus side you're", "74:23", "dealing with someone that has a lot more", "74:24", "life experience that's raising a child", "74:26", "yeah you know versus my mom had me when", "74:29", "she was 20 21", "74:31", "you know what the fuck do you know you", "74:35", "don't know much but if you're a woman", "74:36", "who has a child when you're 40 well hey", "74:38", "that's a rich life of a lot of", "74:40", "experiences and maybe you can impart", "74:42", "some of that wisdom to your child and", "74:44", "look at things in a different way and", "74:46", "maybe that in turn will raise a child", "74:47", "that's more balanced you know I'm", "74:50", "talking out of my area here but I I", "74:52", "think that probably you know the eggs", "74:57", "sit around for a long time and I don't", "75:02", "know what the effect of aging on the egg", "75:04", "is mmm I just don't know well there's", "75:08", "also a big factor with the male sperm", "75:09", "male sperm is a thing and that's one of", "75:11", "the main contributed by autism and", "75:13", "schizophrenia is supposedly I've heard", "75:17", "of that you know older fathers are more", "75:19", "likely to", "75:21", "have male sons that are schizophrenic", "75:24", "yeah that makes sense", "75:25", "I would say that is the fact but I've", "75:27", "heard that well it all makes sense that", "75:28", "there be some glitches and the matrix's", "75:31", "yeah I mean we're not we're not supposed", "75:32", "to live that long are we not what are", "75:36", "your thoughts on people that are trying", "75:37", "to live longer and and trying to sort of", "75:40", "squeeze out as much time as I can on", "75:42", "this rock no it's like I see a lot of", "75:45", "old people that just don't want to live", "75:47", "anymore and I understand that you know", "75:49", "your body starts falling apart mind is", "75:52", "going what's the point at that point", "75:54", "yeah but what about the people that can", "75:56", "keep it together yeah yeah I guess if", "75:59", "you keep it together you want to like", "76:00", "you know okay let's just go sports okay", "76:03", "let's go to the moon and go to Mars", "76:05", "well pharmacological solutions to it I", "76:08", "mean if we if there was some sort of a", "76:10", "genetic component that they identified", "76:13", "to aging and they gave the option to", "76:16", "reverse the process would you", "76:18", "participate or do you like it", "76:21", "do you like the finite nature of this", "76:23", "existence uh I do I think so it's like I", "76:27", "knew you I think I don't and that I take", "76:35", "certain medications but rather just live", "76:39", "most of my life as as possible without", "76:41", "them so what medications do you take you", "76:45", "know blood pressure and mainly blood", "76:48", "pressure stuff yeah do you exercise not", "76:50", "enough that's all yeah they got a big", "76:53", "effect on anxiety and a big effect on", "76:55", "just yes a general alleviation of angst", "76:59", "so that's a good example of something I", "77:01", "know I should do yet is that a", "77:04", "discipline issue uh I used to be kind of", "77:07", "discipline but what happened", "77:09", "I've been using it a lot to you you know", "77:12", "to do things like I really want to do", "77:17", "like writing or making music and so", "77:20", "those are the things that kind of I know", "77:24", "I should like do the exercise too so I", "77:26", "can do more of that longer yeah you", "77:27", "think do you have a finite amount of", "77:29", "discipline uh possibly each person has", "77:32", "it you know define that has that sort of", "77:35", "anxiety quotient that discipline", "77:37", "quotient that we kind of you probably", "77:41", "can work that like a muscle yeah what", "77:44", "imagine you can yeah yeah you could", "77:46", "become something different might me and", "77:48", "my friends have this thing that we did", "77:50", "last year called sober October for the", "77:53", "entire month you know no alcohol no", "77:55", "marijuana no drugs and crazy exercise", "77:58", "like last year we had a competition to", "78:00", "see like who could exercise the most we", "78:02", "wore these heartrate monitors and we we", "78:05", "measured points like you get a certain", "78:07", "amount of points at 80 percent of your", "78:08", "max heart rate per minute what my point", "78:11", "is one of the things that I got out of", "78:13", "this and we all got out we all talked", "78:14", "about it because we were exercising", "78:16", "hours and hours a day an incredible", "78:18", "alleviation of anxiety incredible like", "78:21", "to the point", "78:22", "exercise regularly but I don't exercise", "78:24", "at that level that that level that we", "78:27", "were doing cuz we were in this", "78:28", "competition was really a lot of cardio", "78:31", "but my god that runner's high is real", "78:34", "yeah I felt amazing I mean I felt like", "78:37", "so good all the time the alleviation of", "78:40", "angst was unlike anything the internal", "78:42", "chatter yeah that sort of can fuck with", "78:44", "your head yeah that just didn't exist", "78:46", "anymore", "78:46", "well I think that that's wonderful that", "78:48", "you're saying that because you have so", "78:50", "many followers and I think that's such", "78:52", "fantastic information to convey to them", "78:54", "it is and it's so available to all of us", "78:57", "I mean anybody that can move their body", "78:59", "can experience us and I don't recommend", "79:02", "what we did because we were working out", "79:04", "five hours six hours but even was you", "79:06", "know I walk I live in New York so I walk", "79:07", "a lot and that's great yeah right you", "79:10", "have to yeah but I mean just that alone", "79:13", "yeah it's it's there's many people that", "79:15", "don't walk you know you just sit here", "79:18", "and then you move to that spot you sit", "79:19", "there and you get in the car you sit", "79:21", "there yeah you get on the train you sit", "79:22", "there and there's very little use of the", "79:25", "body and the body starts to atrophy yeah", "79:27", "by pumping that blood through the system", "79:30", "and cleaning out the pipes and getting", "79:32", "that air into the lungs and forcing", "79:33", "yourself to move when it's over you feel", "79:36", "better I'm breathing better and", "79:39", "imagining it imagining this exercise", "79:42", "what do you take what about nature do", "79:45", "you take any time in nature at all do", "79:46", "you go to Central Park well we have a", "79:48", "house up in Sullivan County in the", "79:50", "Catskills oh that's nice how often you", "79:52", "get a chance to get out there we spend a", "79:54", "lot of time there

you", "94:24", "know a lot of what we've been talking", "94:25", "about we've just been having a", "94:26", "conversation my work is very rather", "94:29", "limited and all I don't work on", "94:30",

probably", "95:01", "true of many people you don't you have", "95:03", "no idea how you're gonna get to the end", "95:04", "you know you have a beginning and you", "95:07", "just see where it goes so this idea of", "95:09", "writing a proposal", "95:10", "so that lays out the whole thing to me", "95:13", "doesn't work because you just don't know", "95:15", "where it's going and the fun part is",

are", "95:30", "involved in extreme activities that yeah", "95:33", "not having to haven't done a lot of", "95:35", "interviews I mean I have talked to", "95:37", "people like that and you know every", "95:41", "individual cases are interesting because", "95:44", "they give you stuff but it's not data so", "95:47", "the data you have to go out and collect", "95:49", "yeah what do you got there for notes you", "95:52", "know pile of notes RJ oh I don't want to", "95:55", "discuss I just thought this brought this", "96:00", "I think we covered most of what I want", "96:04", "to say you know the amygdala is not a", "96:06", "fear Center behaviors not primarily a", "96:09", "tool of the mind it's a tool of survival", "96:11", "we think we know why we do the things we", "96:14", "do and others do them but we don't", "96:16", "really because we our conscious mind is", "96:18", "not privy to all of the things that the", "96:22", "body and brain are doing now when you", "96:25",

"96:35", "out thinking this was a way to study", "96:37", "emotion and at the time I had been", "96:42", "studying these these human patients with", "96:44", "the split brain surgery and can you",

connections between", "97:30", "the two sides of the brain room are", "97:31", "separated so information one side", "97:33", "doesn't cross over to the other they do", "97:35", "that they open up the skull pull the two", "97:42", "you know you've got kind of two loaves", "97:44", "of bread sitting next to each other and", "97:46", "they're connected by threads which are", "97:49", "axons that go between them and so you", "97:52", "pull apart here and you can see where", "97:54", "those axons are and you open it up from", "97:56", "the top so imagine like a hot dog bun", "97:59", "okay and so you open it up at the top", "98:02", "and you can look down in the center and", "98:05", "imagine that there was like a bunch of", "98:08", "wires crossing between the two sides of", "98:11", "the bun so those wires would then be", "98:14", "surgically sectioned and so now you end", "98:17", "up with two sides of the brain separate", "98:21", "and independent", "98:22", "so typically language is on the left", "98:25", "side so you can talk to that side the", "98:27", "right side doesn't have language so you", "98:30", "have to ask what what can it do so if", "98:32", "you present a stimulus that only the", "98:35", "right hemisphere sees and you do that by", "98:38", "flashing a picture of an apple on the", "98:42", "left side of space because everything to", "98:44", "the left of center goes to the right", "98:46", "hemisphere and everything to the right", "98:47", "of center goes to the left hemisphere so", "98:50", "you send a stimulus to the right", "98:51", "hemisphere and you say what did you see", "98:55", "and the left hemisphere answers because", "98:57", "that's worth languages he says I didn't", "98:59", "say anything", "99:00", "so okay you said reach into this bag and", "99:04", "see what's in there the right hand goes", "99:06", "in that's connected to the left", "99:08", "hemisphere can't find it the left hand", "99:11", "goes in connected to the right", "99:12", "hemisphere that which saw the Apple it", "99:14", "pulls out the Apple so the right", "99:18", "hemisphere has information that the left", "99:20", "hemisphere can't talk about what is life", "99:22", "like for people once they've done that", "99:24", "operation", "99:25", "well slowly it the left hemisphere kind", "99:29", "of comes to dominate again", "99:32", "the you know they they come to live with", "99:36", "it and how does it prevent seizures well", "99:39", "the the folklore of it I don't know if", "99:43", "this is actually true but what is often", "99:45", "said is that it prevents the seizures", "99:47", "from jumping back and forth and having", "99:50", "you know because the the electrical", "99:53", "activity jumping back and forth sort of", "99:55", "gets into a kind of endless loop that", "99:58", "can't stop but cutting that isolates the", "100:01", "seizures and the two hemispheres and", "100:03", "makes each one more controllable like", "100:05", "taking
