you know there's a lot", "07:56", "of people that oppose it of course I", "07:57", "mean there's a lot of people that don't", "07:59", "think it out they think with their mind", "08:01", "or their or their mothers and they don't", "08:03", "even get the origin of the minimum wage", "08:05", "was racism I mean the first minimum wage", "08:08", "is here it was designed to keep", "08:10", "employers from hiring the Chinese or", "08:13", "from hiring blacks because they you know", "08:15", "the that that's where the minimum wage", "08:17", "came from you know to try to prevent", "08:18", "employers from hiring certain people so", "08:21", "they said well let's have a minimum wage", "08:22", "and and that will reduce hiring of", "08:24", "people who have less skills and and so", "08:26", "and the labor unions the biggest", "08:28", "supporters of the minimum wage are the", "08:31", "labor unions and none of the labor", "08:33", "unions workers earn the minimum wage so", "08:36", "you might think why are they a so care", "08:38", "about the minimum wage if they don't get", "08:39", "paid a lot higher than men wage and it's", "08:41", "because you always have a competition", "08:43", "between skilled labor and unskilled", "08:46", "labor right so let's say a business", "08:48", "this man has the option of hiring a", "08:51", "skilled person to do something and let's", "08:52", "say the skilled person is gonna charge", "08:55", "$20 an hour or an unskilled person and", "08:59", "let's say I can hire three unskilled", "09:01", "people for $5 an hour and that equals 15", "09:04", "well hey I'd rather hire the unskilled", "09:07", "worker I can pay 3 $5 an hour to do the", "09:09", "same job of one skilled worker but now", "09:11", "if the skilled worker can could lobby", "09:13", "for a $7 minimum wage now if I have to", "09:16", "hire 3 unskilled people it cost $21 AHA", "09:19", "now all of a sudden I hire the guy with", "09:21", "skills so the labor unions benefit by", "09:24", "keeping unskilled people unemployed", "09:27", "because they have more skills and", "09:29", "therefore they can you know they can get", "09:31", "more work that sounds like a complicated", "09:34", "mess to me it is a mess for the owner", "09:37", "for the people that get get priced out", "09:39", "of a job yeah", "09:45", "[Applause]", "English
