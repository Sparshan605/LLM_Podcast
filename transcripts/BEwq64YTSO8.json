"podium and they don't have a podium but", "10:52", "sometimes it is because they deserve it", "10:54", "but not generally and the judges", "11:00", "nowadays", "11:02", "I I think that they just give it I see", "11:07", "too often that they almost go down the", "11:11", "easy route like you know they just give", "11:15", "it to who's aggressive but guys walking", "11:17", "forward or guys throwing punches it's", "11:19", "like they're favoring that guy and it's", "11:21", "more to it than that and I understand it", "11:24", "to support us and help itself they don't", "11:25", "make a clear criterium for but it's", "11:28", "supposed to be clean harder effective", "11:31", "punches because the separation of", "11:33", "professional boxing and amateur boxing", "11:35", "is you have to sell it you have to make", "11:37", "money right and you got to put Fannie's", "11:39", "in the seat so you want to see guys get", "11:42", "hurt you want to see guys impact guys so", "11:44", "it's the cleaner who hurts the guy more", "11:46", "it's the cleaner more impactful punches", "11:48", "but it's not just drone it's not just", "11:50", "aggression because the aggression has to", "11:53", "lead to something effective effective", "11:56", "aggression so I I saw for me to get it", "12:00", "to that 117 112 I saw golovkin on the", "12:07", "outside control range controlling", "12:09", "distance you want to use that silly word", "12:12", "ring generalship because I have the time", "12:14", "I don't know what they're talking about", "12:15", "they say ring general look right what", "12:18", "are you talking about I just saw the way", "12:19", "you judged it what would it where did", "12:21", "you fit in ring generalship into that", "12:23", "into your thinking because I'd like to", "12:25", "know but if it is ring generalship he", "12:29", "was controlling range he was controlling", "12:31", "outside he was keeping the shorter man", "12:32", "on the outside catching him with the jab", "12:35", "making him earn his way in making them", "12:37", "pay a price to get in now was the other", "12:40", "guy Canelo being the other guy landing", "12:42", "the hard clean body shots that sometimes", "12:45", "you don't get credit for yeah he was Oh", "12:47", "like I say on a yesterday he was putting", "12:49", "water in a basement", "12:50", "yeah he definitely was but the jab", "12:54", "didn't count suddenly was suddenly in a", "12:56", "universe where the jab of a guy doesn't", "13:00", "mean anything when we don't want it to", "13:02", "mean anything when we want to give it to", "13:04", "the aggressive guide to the to the guy", "13:06", "trying to you know trying to get in", "13:08", "there the question is like what's more", "13:09", "important is a jab more important or a", "13:11", "hook to the body what is more important", "13:13", "and you're to the body clean is more", "13:15", "important", "13:15", "but if the jab outnumbers the hooks to", "13:18", "the body through many rounds and and the", "13:21", "numbers are significant that it's", "13:24", "greater than then you have to account", "13:27", "for that right so you think that people", "13:28", "are watching they're watching a couple", "13:30", "of jabs and then one hook to the body", "13:32", "and they count that one hook to the body", "13:33", "better than they count the two tabs and", "13:35", "I don't have a problem with that because", "13:37", "I counted it that way till if it's a", "13:39", "good shot", "13:39", "yeah because again a power shot yeah", "13:43", "because that is what's gonna drive", "13:44", "people to the event right to the sport", "13:46", "there's a harder punches so I have no", "13:48", "problem with that but if the jabs are", "13:51", "twenty jabs right and it's two body", "13:54", "punches well then I'm starting to say we", "13:56", "can't forget the jabs because the body", "13:59", "punch has got your attention", "14:00", "mm-hmm and and it you know it moved you", "14:05", "out of your seat a little bit maybe", "14:06", "because for whatever reason so I'm just", "14:10", "saying that the crit\u00e9rium is not clean", "14:14", "enough for the judges sometimes well", "14:17", "it's a bit even bigger mass in MMA and", "14:19", "it's a lot of the same judges you mean I", "14:21", "think the problem with judging is the", "14:23", "same at both sports you should have", "14:25", "someone who has experience in the sport", "14:26", "I mean they they have to have a deep", "14:28", "understanding of what they're actually", "14:29", "watching and that's not the case I know", "14:32", "it's not the case in boxing because I", "14:33", "know a lot of the same judges from", "14:35", "boxing also judge MMA they don't know", "14:37", "what they're talking about in MMA and I", "14:39", "don't think they know what they're", "14:39", "talking about in boxing either and", "14:41", "that's a real travesty it's a huge", "14:43", "disservice to these professional", "14:45", "athletes who literally are as you said", "14:47", "risking everything as they step in there", "14:50", "there's a real good chance that they", "14:52", "might not come out I mean it happens", "14:54", "every so many fights a guy dies this is", "14:57", "just a fact in boxing and the football -", "15:00", "football - sure MMA as well well MMA has", "15:03", "plenty of problems you know I mean", "15:05", "there's there's less deaths in MMA but", "15:07", "we're getting deaths from weigh-ins you", "15:09", "know we have a lot of extreme weight", "15:10", "cutting issues and some of the smaller", "15:12", "organizations in particular all of that", "15:14", "stuff is legitimate it's a problem", "15:16", "something that should be looked at it's", "15:18", "just a shame that the judging is so poor", "15:20", "and it's been this way for so long well", "15:23", "through the boxing I mean you have it", "15:26", "then I'm not saying this in a derogatory", "15:28", "way in some ways it's a good way but you", "15:31", "have a dictator running you know UFC no", "15:34", "but but it's okay to have a dictator", "15:36", "sometimes because at least you have",

and if the openin was", "37:29", "there bang he was gonna throw the punch", "37:30", "so he did and he dropped loose a few", "37:33", "times and you know he won that fight and", "37:37", "what round
