1-800", "03:31", "requested test that cost $99 okay", "03:33", "there's a reason this cause this test is", "03:34", "40 plus grand but the thing that I'm", "03:37", "wondering does John have another test", "03:40", "out there if he does it doesn't mean", "03:41", "it's going to come back but that was the", "03:44", "same spot I was in there was a shoe that", "03:45", "could drop for me it did for him is", "03:47", "there another test out there and if", "03:48", "there's not then who sadhas' got some", "03:49", "explaining to do if you're telling me a", "03:51", "guy that's got a track record the tested", "03:54", "positive for cocaine gonna fight in the", "03:55", "biggest fight of his career in the last", "03:57", "time you tested him was one month before", "03:58", "the bout then oh sadhas' got some", "04:00", "explaining to do but there's more to the", "04:02", "story now what do we hear it does he", "04:04", "pass his end up in the spot I don't know", "04:06", "but that's that's the piece that's still", "04:08", "missing", "04:08", "well there's one aspect to his test his", "04:12", "positive test that people are saying", "04:14", "could possibly play a factor and it's", "04:18", "supplements that he could possibly have", "04:20", "been taking something that like this is", "04:23", "what happened Tim means this is what", "04:25", "happened", "04:26", "Yoel Romero where they get a supplement", "04:29", "and it says it has a bunch of stuff on", "04:31", "it", "04:31", "says you look through the ingredients", "04:32", "okay creatine b12 we're good we're good", "04:35", "but then when you run it through a lab", "04:37", "it turns out there's a bunch of other", "04:38", "stuff in there too and that's why it's", "04:40", "so effective and that's why it sells so", "04:42", "it is possible that that could be the", "04:45", "case we don't know yet because then if", "04:47", "that's the case then john has to give", "04:49", "them all the supplements that he was", "04:51", "taking and then they have to go to a", "04:53", "store buy them independently test them", "04:55", "and verify that these ingredients were", "04:57", "in not just the batch that he hands them", "04:59", "but also in other batches so it's not", "05:01", "like he doctored it showing some stuff", "05:02", "in there", "05:03", "sure but estrogen blockers are usually", "05:05", "when people are getting off of steroids", "05:07", "right when you're coming off a cycle", "05:09", "yeah it's a blocker you know men don't", "05:11", "want estrogen anyway but it's a blocker", "05:12", "it's it's not going to so as far as that", "05:14", "substance goes and that's all that's all", "05:16", "he's gonna have to live with you're not", "05:17", "gonna evaluation explain how they work", "05:19", "like for someone it doesn't all that an", "05:21", "estrogen blocker will do if you up your", "05:23", "testosterone then your estrogen just", "05:25", "naturally ups and guys don't want", "05:26", "estrogen so if your guy you you take a", "05:28", "blocker that can block that bring it you", "05:30", "won't get you know the demands over", "05:33", "there you may come though I'm trying to", "05:34", "make it work", "05:35", "guy Gaston I can't even I came from", "05:37", "bitch tits is all that comes to mind I", "05:39", "can't think of the word dime dime we're", "05:42", "closed", "05:42", "I know I know I know gotta mastica at", "05:44", "any rate it can stop some of those", "05:46", "things so that's the speculation the", "05:48", "reason that that's on the list is they", "05:50", "find that that's a way they can catch", "05:51", "you after the fact hey if we missed you", "05:53", "doing the cycle we can catch you're here", "05:54", "well it's not just that the the reason", "05:56", "why they take it after the cycle is", "05:58", "because you get hypogonadism your your", "06:00", "your body stops producing testosterone", "06:03", "because you took exogenous testosterone", "06:05", "that's right and so the to restart it", "06:07", "they take this stuff these estrogen", "06:10", "blockers that's right yeah I tested", "06:12", "positive for an estrogen blocker and it", "06:13", "was that exact same thing they banned", "06:15", "testosterone I went on something called", "06:16", "HCG she'll return your testes back on", "06:20", "and then you have to clone f\u00e9in which is", "06:22", "by definition an estrogen blocker for", "06:24", "that same thing but it can also help get", "06:27", "your body going back on testosterone so", "06:29", "they're being John's got a problem again", "06:31", "this comes back to the press conference", "06:32", "he said I have not taken anything new", "06:34", "that I have not taken my entire career", "06:36", "so somebody gave him a follow-up", "06:38", "question he quickly realized what he", "06:40", "just said", "06:40", "and he goes why I do have a new", "06:42", "supplement company I have taken some new", "06:44", "supplements so he realized he put", "06:46", "himself in one point need to get out of", "06:48", "it", "06:48", "the supplement company then who dropped", "06:50", "him immediately quit came out with the", "06:52", "press release said do not put this on us", "06:53", "we don't have anything to do with that", "06:55", "and we'll turn over any samples you want", "06:56", "so that that's that's the downside to", "06:58", "holding a press conference is if there's", "07:00", "anything the Commission hates it's when", "07:02", "somebody isn't honest with them well", "07:04", "there's anything who sada hates if it's", "07:05", "with Lance Armstrong found out it's when", "07:07", "you deny the scientific accuracy of", "07:10", "their test that's the risk with holding", "07:14", "a press conference that's why most legal", "07:16", "teams will tell you go home", "07:18", "be quiet rewrite the right to remain", "07:20", "silent execute
