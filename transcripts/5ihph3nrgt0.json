back and shoot", "12:58", "the that's not accurate that what they", "13:00", "actually would do is put the arrows in", "13:02", "between their fingers and they", "13:04", "developed technique they would draw and", "13:06", "pull and draw and pull and draw just", "13:09", "release one at a time yes and they would", "13:10", "go from finger to finger so they", "13:12", "literally could shoot an

you see that they're", "13:24", "holding multiple arrows in their hands", "13:26", "right instead of in a quiver and so he", "13:29", "figured out how to do it it where he can", "13:32", "shoot multiple arrows in a second and", "13:35", "see if he can get to him she's so like", "13:37", "see he's doing that that's him pulling", "13:39", "arrows out and this is what the Comanche", "13:42",
