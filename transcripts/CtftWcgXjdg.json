like I did not have a dog in", "05:45", "this race so let me tell you three", "05:46", "reasons I don't think that's compelling", "05:48", "number one when when Lisa Lippmann", "05:50", "looked at the

there's two other reasons so we", "06:01", "wouldn't expect that if it were randomly", "06:03", "distributed among the population but", "06:05", "there are two other reasons I don't", "06:06", "think that's right number one if we're", "06:08", "just rewarding to normal now that", "06:10", "there's greater society societal", "06:12", "acceptance right we're just saying we're", "06:14", "just aborting to reverting to a normal", "06:16", "base rate of transgender women where Y", "06:19", "where all the women in their 40s and 60s", "06:21", "coming out as trans they should be", "06:22",

"06:30", "we're seeing the same population that", "06:32", "gets involved in cutting demonic", "06:34", "possession witchcraft anorexia bulimia", "06:37", "convinces themselves there's a problem", "06:39", "and and there's one anyway there's", "06:42", "there's one last reason is that suicide", "06:44", "rates are going up but if these women", "06:48", "who were living under a prior you know", "06:50", "supposedly these all these transgender", "06:52", "these real transgender people who are", "06:54", "living under a more repressive regime", "06:55", "and are now just finding themselves this", "06:57", "you would think the suicide rate would", "06:59", "be going down with greater acceptance so", "07:02", "when you're saying suicide rates are", "07:03", "going up you mean suicide rates with", "07:04", "teens who turn trans both we that's the", "07:07", "rate of trans to aside among this", "07:10", "population fall among girls in general", "07:12", "is extraordinarily high this is just one", "07:15", "part of the mental health crisis they're", "07:16", "in and second of all we know that the", "07:19", "rate that these these kids that these", "07:20", "trans identified kids have very high", "07:22", "rates of suicide suicidal ideation it's", "07:25", "it's really you know an area of real", "07:27", "concern but there's definitely an area", "07:30", "of real concern as well with social", "07:32", "media did you read Jonathan Heights book", "07:35", "the coddling of the American mind yeah", "07:37", "it was on your show that I really like", "07:40", "this light bulb went on when I rewatched", "07:42", "it because he talked about exactly this", "07:45", "he connects it to social media and he", "07:47", "talked about on your show the huge rates", "07:50", "were seeing an anxiety depression all", "07:52", "among these same girls and you know", "07:56", "putting it together with Lisa Lippman's", "07:57", "research and the other investigation I", "07:59", "done I think it's really pretty clear", "08:01", "that one more manifestation of these", "08:03", "girls who were we know are involved in a", "08:05", "lot of cutting and all kinds of", "08:06", "self-harm this is one form of self-harm", "08:08", "for them so there are so let's", "08:11", "essentially say there's young teenagers", "08:14", "that are confused and they're looking", "08:18", "for something that makes them feel whole", "08:20", "or something that makes them feel normal", "08:22", "or something that gives them some sort", "08:24", "of an escape from this angst that they", "08:26", "suffer from and you're thinking that", "08:29", "turning trans is one of those pathways", "08:32", "that they gravitate towards but it might", "08:35", "not necessarily be a good idea for them", "08:37", "yeah that's exactly right if these girls", "08:38", "were transitioning to boys and they were", "08:40", "living great lives and their mental", "08:42", "health was great like it is for so many", "08:44", "at Trent endure adults I wouldn't have", "08:46", "written this book that's a great story", "08:48", "like this is great for so many", "08:49", "transgender adults because even in", "08:51", "gender adults", "08:52", "suicide rates very high there's no", "08:54", "question and that's you know that's a", "08:57", "separate issue but I do think that yeah", "08:59", "I agree I think that there are I believe", "09:02", "that there are transgender adults who", "09:04", "have been helped by transition sure but", "09:05", "these girls are not being helped by", "09:07", "transition just universally I think as a", "09:09", "population yeah I mean that's that's", "09:11", "what Lisa Lisa Lippmann study showed but", "09:13", "also through my investigation you know I", "09:15", "hear

"09:33", "call right and I mean I mean strange I", "09:36", "don't mean strange in a negative way I", "09:39", "mean it's you're dealing with hormones", "09:42", "in a human body like you're you're", "09:44", "taking a woman and you're injecting", "09:47", "hormones into her body and you're saying", "09:49", "that these exogenous hormones are what's", "09:52", "going to fix her and I never I never", "09:55", "understand that like if if so this is my", "09:57", "argument about this like how do we know", "10:00", "how do you know that that's what's going", "10:03", "to do it and when you are doing that", "10:05", "what damage is being done so it's one", "10:08", "thing if someone's a 25 year old woman", "10:10", "and they say I have always wanted to be", "10:12", "a man and I think I'm a man I think I", "10:14", "was I think I'm born in the wrong body", "10:16", "but when you're going through this", "10:18", "developmental cycle from 17 18 19 20", "10:21", "there is a lot of

an intervention", "10:34", "chemically some sort of if you just step", "10:37", "in now and start injecting this body", "10:39", "with male hormones it's gonna fix all", "10:41", "your problems but yeah that's really", "10:43", "popular to do that it's really popular", "10:45", "these girls are getting it on their own", "10:46", "diagnosis so they're just going in and", "10:49", "self diagnosing

"11:46", "both kinds Jesus that's a big decision", "11:50", "right that's a decision that you can't", "11:52", "really come back from what what did the", "11:55", "surge if you talk to surgeons wellness", "11:57", "what do they think they think that", "12:00", "obviously we're generalizing right so", "12:02", "they think a couple things I mean", "12:04", "obviously there are a lot of

you", "95:03", "have this chemical or hormonal", "95:05", "intervention and you change your your", "95:07", "body and you change who you are and then", "95:10", "regret and then coming back and they",

that you", "95:28", "are very different than someone like", "95:30", "Jamie who doesn't have this issue right", "95:32", "who's just a man you know that people", "95:35", "are different so why would you think", "95:37", "that there's no way anybody could go", "95:40", "through that", "95:41", "and have regret right his people very", "95:43", "right so much but they were so in", "95:46",
