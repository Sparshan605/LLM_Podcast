side", "05:15", "what are you giving you know me shit for", "05:17", "any I got to tell you you're unethical", "05:20", "for shooting at a target yeah you're", "05:22", "practicing at that range like

"05:39", "the speed of an arrow and the accuracy", "05:41", "and you take a guy you know shooting", "05:44", "whatever 290 feet per second how long", "05:46", "does it take his arrow to get to 80", "05:48", "yards how long does it take an arrow to", "05:49", "get from you know 170 feet per second to", "05:52", "35 yards so I kind of evened all that up", "05:55", "and said well here's apples to apples", "05:57", "oranges to oranges is it fuck I got hate", "06:00", "mail I mean you're a horrible hunter", "06:03", "you're using your ability instead of", "06:05", "hunting skills you know to shooting so I", "06:08", "was like fuck it I sold everything I had", "06:10", "every compound every side every arrow I", "06:12", "didn't want that temptation and I'm like", "06:14", "I'm gonna shoot it up we'll see right I", "06:16", "will see how good I can get cuz I never", "06:17", "shot a stick though so you just because", "06:20", "of people's reaction to you you decided", "06:22", "to go to a recurve bow hunter purse", "06:24", "which is for people who aren't seeing", "06:25", "the difference so this can be absorbed", "06:29", "by people don't hunt the difference is", "06:31", "when you have a compound bow you have a", "06:33", "sight on a compound bow that will allow", "06:35", "you to scroll out you could roll out to", "06:37", "like so my site has said it there", "06:39", "that's where it's normally set out but", "06:41", "you can go all the way to 120 yards and", "06:44", "when it does is it it raises your PIN so", "06:47", "it changes where the pin goes up and", "06:49", "down and the pin is how you aim so you", "06:51", "can get really accurate see if your guy", "06:53", "like campaigns I mean he shoots at a", "06:57", "hundred yards all the time and you know", "07:00", "he can get into a small group at a", "07:02", "hundred yards John Dudley the same thing", "07:04", "it's very accurate whereas with a", "07:07", "recurve bow there's no sight you're", "07:09", "doing it with the point of your arrow", "07:11", "and you're you have to practice much", "07:14", "more and it's like throwing a rock like", "07:16", "you get a take these throw rocks all", "07:18", "time you kind of get a feel of where you", "07:20", "can throw that rock yeah throwing that", "07:22", "rock was a lot harder than I thought it", "07:24", "was gonna be let me tell you oh so I'm", "07:26", "very uh goal oriented and I had a", "07:31", "problem which is much I don't I'm not", "07:32", "very good at losing and I'm not saying", "07:33", "I'm a spoiled loser I'm psychotic when I", "07:36", "lose it something like my wife will tell", "07:38", "you I'll go to a tournament first thing", "07:39", "I do when I get home I'm having her film", "07:41", "me breaking down things so I thought", "07:42", "well we're gonna see if I can if these", "07:45", "people are right I'm gonna I'm gonna", "07:46", "find out I'm gonna do nothing but trad", "07:48", "and so trad meaning tradition", "07:50", "traditional archery yeah and so I am", "07:54", "lucky enough you fall Tom clumb right", "07:56", "he's like yeah Yoda of yeah traditional", "07:59", "archery so I go down there with a wad of", "08:01", "cash and I'm like and they've got", "08:03", "several hundred recurve so I'm like hey", "08:05", "I'm gonna shoot a stick bow guys and", "08:07", "they're like they've seen me shoot a", "08:10", "comp in there like cool let's let's get", "08:12", "you set up and I'm thinking get hand-eye", "08:14", "coordination it shouldn't be a problem", "08:16", "fuck man I'm like I went from shooting", "08:19", "58 X's on a 5-spot on average so I can't", "08:23", "hit the target they're 20 yards and I'm", "08:25", "like oh this fucking I've only shot a", "08:28", "recurve bow a couple of times but I did", "08:30", "it recently in Hawaii like last summer", "08:32", "and they had like some range out there", "08:35", "and they had recurve bows you could", "08:37", "shoot", "08:37", "it's amazing how difficult it is to hit", "08:39", "something if you don't have any", "08:41", "experience doing it yeah well and I was", "08:43", "lucky because I had that whole family", "08:44", "there to help me right so they're you", "08:46", "know it's like you haven't dug lean can", "08:48", "you know I they took me under their wing", "08:50", "and they're explaining this and so I got", "08:53", "what I thought was good pretty fast", "08:54", "which forty yards with a stick post far", "08:57", "but I hadn't hunted yet you know and so", "09:00", "then I I go out and I don't remember I", "09:02", "shot that black bear and uh you know I'm", "09:05", "within 40 yards of it for 20 minutes and", "09:08", "in my mind I'm thinking he would be so", "09:10", "dead if I had my compound I just", "09:12", "couldn't get a shot and I finally", "09:13", "squeaked it in missed it at like 18", "09:16", "yards and I'm like she's nuts look so", "09:19", "luckily and Tom had told me this she", "09:23", "said you're gonna get two or three shots", "09:24", "in the animal they don't they don't hear", "09:25", "the bow they don't landed by its feet it", "09:28", "kind of looked around and I'm like oh", "09:29", "I'm not gonna miss you again she got it", "09:31", "on the second shot and oh my god this", "09:34", "isn't you know I get this picture no", "09:37", "have any qualms about hunting with it", "09:39", "like how long did it take before you", "09:40", "felt ethical enough to hunt with it", "09:42", "well I hide it within three months did", "09:45", "you feel like that was a smart move or", "09:47", "do you feel like you rushed it well let", "09:51", "me I was psychotic shooting ten hours a", "09:55", "day like I was shooting constantly so if", "09:58", "in I think I was fine because I had the", "10:01", "coaching I had the help and I had the", "10:03", "accuracy I could hit I mean I was doing", "10:05", "well okay to what I had to compare to", "10:08", "around me I was like okay this is good", "10:10", "so I didn't feel like I went into it", "10:12", "unethical like I couldn't hit what I was", "10:14", "aiming at but I didn't have experience", "10:15", "and I mean you look at knowledge and", "10:17", "wisdom right knowledge you're reading", "10:19", "about it wisdom you're experiencing it", "10:21", "well I thought what I knew from shooting", "10:23", "a compound my hunting skills would be", "10:25", "enough and they were I ended up shooting", "10:27", "I don't know eleven twelve animals that", "10:29", "year but fuck man it was like every time", "10:33", "I went out I was learning something new", "10:34", "and I had to totally change my hunting", "10:36", "style when you think about it from a", "10:38", "perspective of someone who's a non", "10:39", "hunter they they question why you would", "10:41", "want to shoot a bow and arrow in the", "10:43", "first place because they think that that", "10:45", "would be less ethical than using a rifle", "10:46", "like if you wanted to shoot something", "10:48", "you should use a rifle you could kill it", "10:50", "quicker it's better to go from that to a", "10:52", "compound boats like why are you doing", "10:54", "that you know and then they realize like", "10:57", "oh you can actually be very accurate", "10:58", "with a compound bow if you have practice", "11:01", "yeah if you learn how to do it correctly", "11:03", "in your discipline but to take it", "11:05", "another level and to go to a recur", "11:06", "like that's that's where it gets to in", "11:09", "some people's minds like are you hunting", "11:11", "for food are you hunting for your ego", "11:14", "like what are you doing like why are you", "11:16", "doing it with a recurve bow and I think", "11:19", "one of the best answers I've ever heard", "11:21", "from anybody is that they said it is", "11:24", "much more difficult but also much more", "11:26", "rewarding and when you're eating that", "11:28", "animal you have this insane sense of", "11:30", "accomplishment that's actually another", "11:32", "level passed even with a compound bow", "11:34", "does that make sense", "11:35", "yeah and you've explained it better", "11:36", "there than I could and I'm gonna give it", "11:38", "a whirl", "11:38", "so I went from your side of the things", "11:40", "making fun of everyone to being addicted", "11:42", "to getting close so now my the first", "11:45", "year I shot a mule deer at four feet in", "11:47", "the cliffs when I drew my bow back my", "11:48", "arrow was between its horns when I drew", "11:50", "up Frank took photos of it and so crazy", "11:53", "and it but it was one of those things", "11:54", "where now the the reward from it like", "11:58", "yeah that that feeling you have when you", "12:00", "get it done is because it's much more", "12:03", "difficult much more much yeah much more", "12:05", "than so think about like what it must", "12:07", "have been like to be the Native", "12:08", "Americans like he's fucking Hungry's", "12:10", "what it was like I mean it", "12:12", "I have technology on my side right and I", "12:15", "have a lot of finders oculars clothing", "12:18", "right everything and so that that year", "12:20", "though when we were going in on a lot of", "12:22", "these animals I was able to get couple", "12:25", "turkeys and a couple of black bear and I", "12:28", "shot a mule deer and that mule deer like", "12:29", "I said when I was in those cliffs my era", "12:32", "was between its antlers when I drew back", "12:33", "so I shot at it three feet and Frank", "12:36", "crazy it was crazy and that would have", "12:38", "never happened how did you sneak up on", "12:40", "it like that luck and women yeah so", "12:42", "Frank he he was glassing it and I", "12:46", "circled there's a probably two and a", "12:48", "half miles around so you were above it", "12:50", "on the cliff no we were when I shot it I", "12:53", "was so you know we were across from it", "12:55", "however far we were I mean over a mile", "12:57", "and I looped way around and I told you", "13:00", "know Frank I said hey when you see me", "13:02", "just give me the you know the touchdown", "13:04", "and I'm above it man I lost I stalked", "13:07", "the wrong rock twice I lost my boots you", "13:09", "know I'm like what cuz cuz you took your", "13:11", "shoes off to sneak in", "13:12", "yeah but except I sneaking in on a", "13:14", "fucking rock right I wasn't at the right", "13:16", "Rock and I cuz to go that far and hit", "13:19", "the exact", "13:20", "same spot is is difficult because I lost", "13:22", "sight of Frank almost the whole way", "13:23", "because I couldn't expose myself so when", "13:25", "I looped around when I would see Frank", "13:28", "he was so far away and I was so close to", "13:31", "the rock that I thought the deer was", "13:32", "under I didn't want to make any crazy", "13:34", "movements and then I would go back 200", "13:36", "yards try and find my boots get my boots", "13:37", "back on loop back around to try to find", "13:40", "the spot so when I finally got to the", "13:41", "right spot Frank stood up mile away held", "13:45", "his hands up and I'm like it's got to be", "13:48", "right in front of me and I caught the", "13:49", "top three inches of it's uh you know", "13:51", "it's velvet antler sticking up and it", "13:53", "was windy so every gust of wind which", "13:55", "about every 10 15 seconds I took a step", "13:57", "I got to 9 yards and I grabbed a rock", "14:01", "and threw it and the mule deer'", "14:03", "everything they tell you everything you", "14:04", "need to know in the top 4 inches of", "14:06", "their antlers so I'm watching those to", "14:07", "see if he moves didn't move at all", "14:10", "nothing threw another Rock nothing threw", "14:12", "another rock and I'm like so explain to", "14:13", "me what he's throwing a rock to try to", "14:15", "give this thing so you get a shot to get", "14:17", "a shot throwing a rock just to make", "14:19", "noise yep in hopes that he just starts", "14:21", "get a reaction yeah and anyway he didn't", "14:25", "move and I'm like I'm gonna climb on", "14:27", "that rock he's bedded under and I mean", "14:29", "you talk about you couldn't have put a", "14:30", "flax seed through my ass with a hammer I", "14:32", "had just started doing this and that", "14:34", "diss dearest feet from me and I got my", "14:37", "foot on the rock he was on and I'm like", "14:40", "I hope this you know I planting off on", "14:43", "my right foot to spring up onto this", "14:44", "rock I waited for a gust of wind so I'm", "14:47", "25 seconds from me to you from this deer", "14:50", "he's got no idea I'm there that gusts to", "14:52", "win hinted I pushed off and I was", "14:54", "worried the shade they'll think it's a", "14:56", "mountain lion pouncing on him so I could", "14:59", "see the shade of my fat head on the back", "15:01", "of his neck and I'm like oh you know it", "15:04", "said one of the most intense moments of", "15:06", "my life we know as far as this goes and", "15:08", "so when I went to draw I had to sweep my", "15:12", "arrow right between his horns and drew", "15:13", "back and shot him you know straight down", "15:15", "and he ran 50 yards and although when", "15:18", "you eat that animal that's got to give", "15:20", "you this insane feeling of", "15:22", "accomplishment it is extremely extremely", "15:25", "rewarding to a points hard to explain", "15:27", "and in words because you've you've", "15:30", "bested the animal in a lot of ways with", "15:33", "sure skill and I'm not saying that like", "15:35", "I'm Billy badass I'm just saying like",

yeah", "72:58", "they suck yeah ain't good in a good way", "73:01", "I got one out here yeah they'll burn out", "73:03", "though yeah they work different parts of", "73:05", "your leg", "73:06", "yeah it's are stabilizing right yeah and", "73:09", "I would imagine like having a sand dune", "73:11", "stepper type shoe on while you are going", "73:16", "on that thing would be the ultimate", "73:17", "well you're right and people do not", "73:19", "think about that and that's one thing", "73:20", "that guys that just run on pavement flat", "73:23", "ground you're when you say a stabilizer", "73:26", "muscle whatever you want to call it the", "73:27", "left and right part of your shins the", "73:29", "first time you take a guy out it hasn't", "73:31", "height side hills like 35 degrees

everywhere and so", "73:51", "we I do a lot of side hills just to get", "73:54", "those muscles ready for that because", "73:57", "it's a different world and it'll it'll", "73:58", "kou I mean you'll be down for a couple", "74:00", "days because they're so sore and stiff", "74:02", "if you never used them and that", "74:04", "treadmill does not help with that but", "74:06", "when I said like that the sand separ", "74:07", "sucks it's a good suck because it's a", "74:10", "way indoors you can yeah yeah one ways I", "74:13", "try to explain people stable Arbour", "74:15", "stabilizer muscles is

now take it and", "74:28", "flip it upside down so that the handle", "74:30", "is on the bottom and the kettlebell is", "74:31", "above so you got to balance that sucker", "74:33", "out and as you're lifting it it's way", "74:35", "more difficult to do and that's that's", "74:38", "using you stabilizer muscles yep and the", "74:40", "thing is those bamboo bars have you ever", "74:42", "used one of

was at 4:00", "78:34", "for a long time", "78:35", "damn yeah but if you hurt my day", "78:39", "I was it because you want to sleep for I", "78:42", "mean were you getting up early or is it", "78:43", "just you have insomnia I haven't I just", "78:46", "don't sleep I sleep I go to sleep well I", "78:48", "don't sleep for that long and now it's", "78:49", "when you wake up is waking up with", "78:51", "something bothering you in your head or", "78:53", "you just fuck I'm awake I'm just like", "78:55", "fuck I'm awake and I got a lot to do and", "78:57", "so but it's gotten better to where I've", "78:59", "been tracking it on the watch I think", "79:03", "you got a g-shot that's why I used to", "79:04", "wear this is one of those ones tracks my", "79:05", "steps and calories and everything so I", "79:07", "thought a Garmin yeah it's a Phoenix", "79:11", "thing solar I think um does that work on", "79:13", "solar power it helps it yeah help", "79:15", "battery life so I did not like the", "79:18", "original because they died pretty", "79:20", "quickly", "79:20", "you know matters batteries this one less", "79:22", "almost like 3-4 weeks really though and", "79:25", "the way that I navigate often UTM grade", "79:28", "coordinate I don't need to leave it on", "79:29", "very long so it works I can use it for a", "79:32", "long time", "79:32", "so that worked with navigation how long", "79:36", "will it last", "79:36", "man I if you left it on I would think", "79:40", "Man three or four days maybe well so in", "79:42", "that three or four days", "79:44", "it's supplementing with solar is that", "79:46", "what it is yeah yeah Wow so that's", "79:49", "fucking amazing so the way that I you", "79:51", "know navigate which actually going back", "79:53", "to the board I can't agree with you more", "79:55", "like I just write shit down and it may", "79:57", "be three sets of 50 crunches three sets", "80:00", "of 50 pushups just you do it yeah and", "80:03", "then check them off the list", "80:04", "right and so and those are the days when", "80:06", "I say I don't want to do anything those", "80:07", "are days on my ass is getting dropped", "80:09", "off the bottom because you fucking have", "80:10", "to do something you're gonna get home", "80:12", "but with the way that I navigate and I", "80:16", "get people crap about this all the time", "80:19", "right you got to watch in a garment", "80:20", "inReach and a GPS you got all kinds of", "80:22", "shit to navigate you know not if I can", "80:24", "use it that's like a big pet peeve of", "80:25", "mine you got all this technology put you", "80:28", "hit the easy button on everything you", "80:29", "never learn how to use it and so I'm", "80:33", "like a real stickler on land nav like", "80:35", "learning how to navigate to a certain", "80:37", "degree in not just using a GPS and so", "80:39", "what I do is I have a is an 8 or 10", "80:41", "digit UTM grid coordinate and I and a", "80:45", "map and what does that mean so the way", "80:47", "the world was mapped basically and I'll", "80:50", "try to explain the seas I can from from", "80:52", "top to bottom there's lines drawn around", "80:54", "it spaced and then there's hoorah hoorah", "80:56", "two lines drawn around it and each one", "80:58", "of those is a square and as you break", "81:00", "that down in squares you end up with a", "81:03", "thousand-meter grid square um this is", "81:06", "like a very plain Jane way to explain it", "81:07", "inside of that grid square when I turn", "81:09", "this on it tells me inside of that grid", "81:13", "square how far I am from left to right", "81:16", "and how far I am from bottom to top so", "81:18", "easting and northing and so inside that", "81:21", "thousand meter grid square my pinpoint", "81:23", "location is a 10 digit grid coordinate", "81:27", "within 3 meters of my location so anyway", "81:30", "once it gives me that I can plot out and", "81:32", "up to where I am and said that grid scar", "81:34", "on my map and gave me my exact location", "81:36", "so what it means is if I'm all fucked up", "81:38", "and have no idea where I'm on I just", "81:40", "turned on my watch it tells me and then", "81:41", "I plot it out on my map and if I'm lost", "81:43", "ok so you plot it shows you on you", "81:46", "watch and then you just look down at the", "81:48", "map to save power and but you actually", "81:51", "know how to use a compass and navigate", "81:54", "and actually use a map yeah exactly", "81:57", "so on a Mac you'll you'll have all these", "82:00", "different grid squares okay", "82:02", "and so this Rob for people just", "82:03", "listening he's drawing stuff right now", "82:05", "on paper so if this it's a thousand", "82:07", "meters over in a thousand meters up a", "82:08", "thousand meter box okay so if I take a", "82:10", "line and I'm 700 meters easting or to", "82:13", "the right so I go over 700 meters", "82:15", "and then I'm 300 meters up I go up 300", "82:18", "meters where those intersect so then you", "82:20", "know what you are where I'm at and so", "82:22", "what people don't understand like if you", "82:24", "talk about a intersection and resection", "82:27", "if you're lost so let's say Jamie herb", "82:31", "in the woods very much", "82:33", "so you're out and you don't know where", "82:35", "you're at but you know two known points", "82:37", "so meaning you can see a mountain over", "82:39", "here and here and you know what those", "82:40", "are and you have a map from where you're", "82:43", "at you can shoot an Asmus to the top of", "82:45", "this mountain", "82:46", "what's an azimuth you take your compass", "82:49", "and it's the basically out of 360", "82:52", "degrees it's the the Asmus or the the", "82:57", "direction of that mountain from where", "82:59", "you're at so you take that and then you", "83:03", "do a back azimuth you draw a line from", "83:05", "the top of that back the top of that", "83:07", "mountain backwards so if it's over 180", "83:10", "you subtract if it's under 180 you add", "83:12", "tell you like you look at it's okay", "83:14", "that's north east and so then you look", "83:16", "behind yourself know when you go that's", "83:18", "southwest nope nope so if I'm if I'm", "83:20", "lost but I don't I don't know where I'm", "83:21", "an okay I know this mountain and I know", "83:23", "this one and I shoot this", "83:25", "you know Asmus with my compass and I", "83:28", "know so right now this is 90 degrees so", "83:32", "that's about 45 degrees so that is under", "83:35", "180 so I add to it and so 180 plus 45 is", "83:40", "what 225 so now I go to on my map the", "83:44", "top of this mountain and I do an ass", "83:47", "miss and that azmuth is going to be 225", "83:50", "frits was in the top mountain is going", "83:52", "to cross my exact location and you", "83:55", "writing this stuff on the map or you", "83:56", "looking at it yes all right now and I go", "83:59", "to this mountain I do", "84:00", "exact same thing and where those two", "84:02", "lines Chris Macross is my exact location", "84:04", "when you draw on your map do you use a", "84:05", "marker to use a highlighter or how do", "84:07", "you do it", "84:08", "I have an erasable pen with me just like", "84:10", "it's just a little like a sharpie", "84:12", "erasable pen and I have a protractor", "84:14", "anyway just because this could this is a", "84:17", "course that takes weeks to actually", "84:18", "learn how to do this from the military", "84:21", "these skills I learned this originally", "84:23", "when I was on that trail crew team and", "84:25", "then it was I learned a little more and", "84:26", "more and more when I was in the military", "84:27", "I went through some land nav schools and", "84:29", "what they do is I drop you off and they", "84:31", "give you you give they give you two ten", "84:33", "digit or eight digit grids ones where", "84:35", "you're at and ones where you're going", "84:36", "and then you have to plot from I'm gonna", "84:38", "lose you here in a minute you're like", "84:39", "this is boring as fuck as it is but", "84:41", "you're gonna have to you have to convert", "84:43", "it from basically there's different", "84:47", "North's from where you're at there's a", "84:49", "grid north a magnetic north before we", "84:51", "get really fucking boring here once you", "84:54", "learn how to do that you're never lost", "84:56", "you can train associate you can with a", "84:58", "you know with and so I'm a real stickler", "85:00", "on using all of those things so I've", "85:02", "taught my wife how to do it it's not", "85:04", "that difficult you know once you get", "85:06", "going as far as so this is something you", "85:08", "learned when you were really young when", "85:09", "you were cutting trees they're 14 I", "85:12", "learned it then and then you learned", "85:14", "more been formally trained in this stuff", "85:16", "as well in the military I was formerly", "85:18", "training in in I went to a class but I", "85:21", "was so young I can barely remember when", "85:22", "I was working for the Forest Service and", "85:25", "then now I teach courses for this", "85:28", "because the the ability to get where", "85:32", "you're going it's kind of lost now", "85:35", "because you just turn on a GPS or you", "85:37", "use base map or on X or whatever right", "85:40", "but the reality is is navigating if", "85:43", "you're in a hurry so if you and I you", "85:45", "know we're in the woods and we needed to", "85:47", "get to a basin before dark you're gonna", "85:50", "have handrails and catching features you", "85:51", "know you know if you can look that map", "85:54", "and see it in a three-dimensional way", "85:55", "and I can grab my compass and say hey if", "85:57", "we head northeast", "85:59", "you know the whole way half-ass we're", "86:01", "gonna hit this Creek and that creeks", "86:03", "gonna intersect with a trail I don't", "86:05", "have to use my compass anymore really", "86:06", "I'm gonna shoot an a Smith and I'm a", "86:08", "look at the farthest point I can see to", "86:10", "where we need to go that I'm gonna be", "86:11", "able to see the whole way", "86:13", "is gonna go in my pocket we're gonna", "86:14", "haul ass eventually we're gonna hit a", "86:16", "creek somewhere but generally where that", "86:20", "creeks at let's say a trail cross is it", "86:21", "there's a handrail and a catching", "86:23", "feature there anyway this is boring shit", "86:25", "but it's not get there quick but what's", "86:27", "interesting is like very few people know", "86:29", "how to do this and this is a critical", "86:31", "skill if you do get lost and a lot of", "86:32", "fucking people get lost in the woods one", "86:34", "of the things that you were talking", "86:35", "about your podcast once and I never", "86:37", "really took into consideration was the", "86:38", "fact that a lot of binocular holders", "86:40", "harnesses have magnets on them", "86:43", "yep a lot of people love those like I've", "86:44", "got one of those one of those nice yeah", "86:47", "but those can fuck with your compass", "86:49", "yeah you got it you definitely have to", "86:51", "hold it out he was giving me shit cuz we", "86:52", "partnered up with him cuz he said my", "86:53", "sales went down from you dickhead and I", "86:55", "was like dude it's just it's gotta be", "86:58", "said right I mean yeah it's got to be", "86:59", "such otherwise people are gonna die well", "87:01", "it's funny cuz I even have I have a", "87:02", "compass in my compass with me all the", "87:04", "time really", "87:05", "yeah I just fucking weird I know um oh", "87:07", "my when I had a g-shock I had a compass", "87:09", "beside Wallace on the Y I'm excited a", "87:12", "little Sun - the thing is it's like when", "87:15", "I meant when I was not now dad in Texas", "87:16", "I don't know where the fuck I'm at right", "87:18", "I died you know it's Texas right and", "87:20", "we're on these huge it's North Texas so", "87:22", "it's like big plateaus and that Palo", "87:25", "Duro Canyon where we were at second", "87:27", "Canyon fucking crazy so you know where", "87:30", "we are", "87:31", "you know these guys have lived there", "87:32", "their entire lives and they're like oh", "87:34", "it's northeast of where you're at I", "87:36", "guarantee they know where Northey", "87:37", "they've formed it their whole lives", "87:39", "where I'm like fuck the fucking sun's", "87:41", "not up the clouds are out which ways", "87:43", "north east well oh there's north east so", "87:45", "I just have always kicked you know carry", "87:46", "you know always have a compass with me", "87:48", "but being lost when you're young and", "87:51", "almost dying that'll help you probably", "87:52", "want to learn too cuz we when I was", "87:54", "super young door in cotton and shit and", "87:56", "snowing and rain in Oregon and he got", "87:58", "lost", "87:58", "oh fuck yeah I almost died twice really", "88:03", "Jesus Christ never by yourself", "88:05", "well now let's I don't want to make this", "88:07", "sound way worse than it was I was a", "88:09", "dipshit I was with my dad he's probably", "88:10", "drinking with his buddies and I went", "88:12", "after a deer and got all fucked up and I", "88:14", "couldn't find my way back", "88:15", "whoa when you were 11 yeah which dad I", "88:20", "can't even I have a twelve-year-old", "88:21", "daughter I can't imagine oh man my poor", "88:24", "mom", "88:24", "alright dealing with this shit I she had", "88:26", "a deal with me", "88:27", "because I I was backpacking when I was", "88:29", "super young right like backpacking all", "88:31", "over the place and and I've always liked", "88:33", "to do it so you can imagine you're you", "88:35", "know nowadays like if my daughter 15", "88:37", "said hey I am I going afford a", "88:38", "backpacking trip into the wilderness a", "88:40", "what oh fuck can I go great I guess", "88:42", "where with my mom had to deal with a lot", "88:45", "of that as a kid I was always super", "88:46", "adventurous I just think that that", "88:49", "feeling of not knowing if you're gonna", "88:51", "survive and then surviving I don't want", "88:55", "my kids to have that but goddamn that's", "88:57", "a valuable well yeah when you we talk", "89:00", "about it all the time that's one of the", "89:01", "reasons I have so much respect for a guy", "89:04", "like Frank or or or Jake they have no", "89:07", "fear of anything when you get to the", "89:08", "point where there's no mountain truly no", "89:11", "mountain too high no valley to whatever", "89:13", "fuck is that saying is there's nothing", "89:16", "that stops you you will get out and most", "89:18", "people lack that meaning if you've back", "89:20", "packed in whatever six miles and as long", "89:23", "as you can get the animal out especially", "89:25", "mule deer you can pack it out and you", "89:26", "see a mule deer two and a half three", "89:28", "mile more miles in and you have no", "89:31", "you're like oh yeah it's like going to", "89:33", "7-eleven we're going right there's not", "89:35", "and this is normal for any backpack um", "89:37", "but I'd say kam would say the same thing", "89:38", "there's nothing we can't get to there's", "89:41", "nothing we worry about we have enough", "89:42", "gear isn't it's a cool feeling you know", "89:45", "I mean I don't think about it anymore", "89:46", "but it's definitely helped put some", "89:48", "animals on the ground well it's also", "89:49", "there's a mindset that the hardcore", "89:52", "backpack hunter has that you they look", "89:57", "forward to those challenges and", "89:59", "overcoming those challenges and then", "90:01", "when those things happen it's something", "90:03", "that you have prepared for so it's it's", "90:06", "actually like almost like a positive", "90:08", "experience yeah and then you get out and", "90:10", "you tell people how far in with you nine", "90:11", "nine miles Wow pack it on one trip oh it", "90:15", "was a big fucker we had to take it twice", "90:17", "and I mean I know a lot of guys have", "90:19", "ruined their body doing that too though", "90:21", "I know quite a few guys that have", "90:23", "sustained injuries with a heavy pack and", "90:26", "I I have like crazy stories when one of", "90:30", "our buddies I was he and I and he killed", "90:32", "an elk and we were seven and a half", "90:34", "miles in and you know he got on the", "90:36", "ground", "90:37", "well he's younger guy and I anyway", "90:41", "we split it in half and it was downhill", "90:43", "the whole way and I know I can pack you", "90:46", "for infinite amount of time downhill so", "90:48", "I'm like fuck it it's downhill I didn't", "90:50", "want to come back so we're having our", "90:52", "little hobnob meeting that next morning", "90:53", "we're getting ready to go out and that", "90:55", "night I ate everything I

bounce", "147:55", "off the shot what would with a plastic", "147:58", "vein like you do with a compound bow", "148:00", "because it hits the shelf and sound", "148:03", "drops you get contact bounce

"149:16", "fuck'em don't you think that this would", "149:18", "be a really good art time for some sort", "149:21", "of hunting education like oh like a", "149:23", "program that people can enter where they", "149:25", "could be taught like adult onset hunting", "149:28", "like people who are adults learn how to", "149:30", "do it someone take you out I mean I know", "149:32", "there's a few people that do similar", "149:34", "things out there but man it would be", "149:36", "real nice especially when you know when", "149:38", "kovat happened and people realize like", "149:40", "hey this

I", "150:39", "don't you know I'm always gonna", "150:40", "encourage people to try it and then now", "150:41", "it's obviously worked out because", "150:42", "they're addicted to it they love it", "150:44", "once you clean it yeah it's so good for", "150:47", "you too it just feels better when you", "150:49", "eat it you like if you eat a real nice", "150:51", "elk steak like you gotta like energy", "150:53", "it's weird it's hard to describe to", "150:55", "people it is and I mean you also have", "150:57", "like for me the fact that I you know the", "151:00", "way I the way I got it it just adds to", "151:03", "the whole experience which is hard to", "151:05", "explain but I think that as a whole like", "151:08", "land navigation you know how to break", "151:10", "down an animal you know animal behavior", "151:13", "yeah they'd be a hell of a class that I", "151:14", "think wouldn't be a horrible time yeah I", "151:16", "think it would be great for people I", "151:17", "mean I wouldn't say do it with archery", "151:19", "notes they do it with a rifle you know", "151:21", "especially people that don't have any", "151:22", "experience in it but I think there'd be", "151:23",

"acquiring your meat like hey we don't", "151:33", "have to factory farm hunting is still a", "151:34", "possibility people go well you know you", "151:36", "can't feed everyone with hunting and", "151:37", "they're right you really can't but guess", "151:39", "what everyone's not gonna do it it's", "151:41", "like everything else it's like you know", "151:42", "the whole world can't go to jujitsu", "151:45", "class it would be too packed yeah that's", "151:47", "good because most people are not gonna", "151:48", "do it anyway it's too hard the same", "151:50", "thing with lifting weights it's the same", "151:52", "thing with yoga it's the same thing with", "151:54", "anything that's difficult difficult", "151:56", "things do not attract people they", "151:57", "attract some people ya attract people", "152:00", "that are interested in challenges yeah", "152:02", "and I I well I would say the only thing", "152:04", "if you did that you probably want the", "152:05", "shooting of the weapon to be the last", "152:07", "portion because a lot of people would", "152:09", "want to just do that and right you know", "152:11", "you earn your way to that and you have", "152:13", "to have a curriculum right oh yeah well", "152:15", "and I talked about that easy button that", "152:17", "people hit all the time one of the", "152:19", "things I got most thankful for is I came", "152:21", "up with a time with no rangefinder I had", "152:24", "to learn to range right and how did you", "152:26", "range with no rangefinder did you learn", "152:27", "how to like like recognize actual", "152:30", "distance of things by thinking of it in", "152:32", "terms of like body sizes like what did", "152:34", "first it was a tape we measure and", "152:37", "you know what I mean you'd roll it out", "152:39", "and we would have different courses or", "152:41", "whatever and when I say we didn't have", "152:43", "rangefinders right when I started there", "152:46", "was like a Bushnell 500 the thing was", "152:48", "the size of this freaking notebook it", "152:50", "was giant it was a mono an ocular and", "152:55", "that was like the first one and then", "152:56", "they had some other ones that they were", "152:58", "probably available to people had a lot", "152:59", "of money but you would be pacing it out", "153:01", "my step as a yard and so I measured out", "153:05", "or we were at a range and I'd make sure", "153:06", "how far everything what you know I would", "153:08", "pace it out so I would guess the yardage", "153:10", "and I would pace it guess the artist and", "153:12", "I would pace it I've heard of archery", "153:13", "competitions where they don't let you", "153:14", "use a rangefinder", "153:15", "so here's the thing with that and so we", "153:19", "talked about Levi before you know Levi", "153:24", "Morgan has shot higher scores at times", "153:27", "on unknown 3d courses where the known 3d", "153:31", "course had a shot a lower score and", "153:33", "those guys had range finders that's how", "153:35", "good that dude is so when you say", "153:37", "unknown you mean 3d courses where you", "153:39", "can't use a rangefinder so
