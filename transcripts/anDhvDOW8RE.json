let's let's just emphasize that", "07:45", "yeah he's a lot bigger so it'd be a real", "07:47", "problem as far as like weight cutting", "07:49", "mm-hmm cuz if they wet Laila Conor fight", "07:52", "it wherever he wants", "07:53", "Conor is gonna weigh somewhere around", "07:54", "170 pounds that's what he's at his best", "07:57", "like in his optimum with no weight", "07:59", "cutting yeah I don't think Floyd's that", "08:01", "big I think Floyd uh I guarantee you", "08:05", "he's probably not more than 160 do you", "08:07", "think Floyd's bigger than 160 in real", "08:08", "life the small dude guy yeah I've got a", "08:13", "person who's really nice short doesn't", "08:14", "mean weight but he's small what wait did", "08:16", "he begin his career at Floyd Mayweather", "08:18", "is all I mean I'm a huge Floyd man with", "08:21", "a family and I think that when it comes", "08:22", "to boxing I think he's like one of the", "08:24", "most skillful boxers that's ever lived I", "08:26", "really do technical if not the most yeah", "08:29", "at 150 150 but that's probably what he", "08:32", "last fought at like did he make when he", "08:35", "met when he fought Canelo didn't he make", "08:37", "him come down a bit", "08:38", "he made him come down like 154 or", "08:40", "something like that it sounds right", "08:41", "something like that I thought it sounded", "08:43", "great", "08:44", "they had some sort of a catch weight", "08:46", "fight I remember no and Canelo's", "08:49", "fighting it while he's fighting in 160", "08:51", "now he's definitely bigger or is he", "08:54", "fighting at 154", "08:55", "out of your love game is 160 right is", "08:56", "that the holdup is the two of them cuz I", "08:59", "think I feel like Canal has been", "09:01", "fighting middleweight - like you fought", "09:02", "Cotto what was that at wasn't that at", "09:06", "middleweight or 154 Alvers Alvarez", "09:09", "catchweight 152 152 okay yeah so he made", "09:14", "Canelo lose some weight", "09:15", "he cuz canal is a lot bigger than him", "09:17", "yeah so canal probably walks around", "09:20", "maybe 20 pounds heavier than that that's", "09:22", "a bad motherfucker - he's good and Floyd", "09:25", "Mayweather just boxed him up yeah", "09:27", "what that's not there I'm here plop oh", "09:29", "look at that", "09:30", "just beautiful right that's the wonder", "09:34", "um could is like put Conners skills just", "09:39", "technical skills match up to somebody", "09:41", "like the counter counter defense like I", "09:44", "can't imagine they would unless", "09:45", "Mayweather so out of shape yeah", "09:48", "hey I'm saying on top of his game him on", "09:51", "top of his game you're not gonna hit him", "09:53", "he's gonna know I mean you have to be",
