each", "73:45", "other but look at the whole thing better", "73:47", "and figure out a better way around", "73:48", "things instead of doing that everybody's", "73:50", "just right versus left and

are long passed on", "120:46", "he's probably bred with dozens of", "120:48", "females oh I see so if it has if it", "120:50", "obviously been alive a long time and it", "120:51", "has that family treatise hanging out of", "120:53", "the front of its head exactly then you", "120:55", "know okay this thing is already it's", "120:57", "already prospered yeah and the idea also", "120:59", "is that to only shoot those males", "121:02", "those those high-status big males it's", "121:04", "actually better for the population", "121:06", "because then the younger males get a", "121:07", "chance to become older mm-hmm because", "121:09", "they'll kill him", "121:10", "they killed young males if a young male", "121:12", "gets fucking frisky and he thinks he's a", "121:14", "badass the big old
